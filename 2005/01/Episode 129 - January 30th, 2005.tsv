303457	322008	Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
323929	326490	We are live!
327531	329392	And this is episode number 129 for this podcast.
332162	333322	January the 30th of 2005.
333442	344785	You're tuned in to the Bee Money Scene's most repaired radio station of all things, Bee Money.
345525	348066	My name is Rob Roberts, but you might know me as Sky.
348606	351667	Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.
352247	357148	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Jamie Summers, a.k.a.
357708	358389	DarkSakura.
358689	359729	I hate my nose.
361485	362305	I hate allergies.
363446	364766	Are you allergic to me?
364786	367247	I've been like this all day.
367287	368348	What is it that you're allergic to?
368628	369068	Everything.
370869	371949	It's not gay people, is it?
373590	374590	Yes, Rob, it's gay people.
374630	374991	I'm sorry.
378612	381593	Also joining us, say hello to TechMassaLoki.
381893	382654	I found my knife.
384474	386075	Please, don't run around the house with it.
387096	390497	Promise me you will not chase DDR Angel around with your knife again this week.
391540	394842	Okay, I'll have to see about that, but sure.
396082	399044	Speaking of DDR Angels, say hello to our special guest.
400004	400344	Hello.
402205	402986	You're always here.
404707	405847	Yeah, now what are you going to call me?
407808	408929	I'm going to call you Al.
410549	412490	I don't know, I just was thinking of the old... forget it.
413151	413431	Anyway...
414713	415173	That's it.
415534	417215	Angel's the only special guest here tonight.
417415	420057	She's not really that special anymore either, because she's always here.
420137	422218	So she's just your standard guest.
422439	424660	She's more of a standard guest than a special guest.
425601	426461	I'm just your pest.
429303	429864	No, no, no.
429924	433687	You wouldn't be a pest, because then when I sprayed the raid on you, it would have gotten rid of you.
434527	435188	Raid?
435828	437369	I'm just kidding.
437789	438110	All right.
439170	439871	But it's just us.
440912	444715	Feeling the love here in the Orange Lounge Radio Studio, especially after a chaotic week last week.
444875	446796	I wish I felt the love for my allergy medicine.
447417	448217	Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.
449438	450759	Well, this should be a lovely night.
452360	454742	Jamie's extra sassy because of her allergies.
454842	455822	Loki's got a knife.
458264	459485	This should be an interesting show.
459845	466710	I'm just trying to turn this into a round cable, but I think I just broke it.
468345	471506	So basically you've got a square cable over there and you're trying to turn it into a round cable.
471526	472827	It's a ribbon cable.
473127	477108	I thought, at least in theory, that I could split these down here.
477849	487893	However, they're a little thinner than I thought, so when I poked this knife through, instead of actually splitting it, it stripped all the covering on this one wire here.
488653	488933	Hmm.
489353	489753	Interesting.
490594	491114	Alright, well...
491471	492032	No, not really.
492052	493273	Not really, yeah.
493393	500658	You can see the action because Loki has decided to go sit in front of the webcam because people say that the webcam is never that exciting.
500719	501799	So Loki is cutting things.
501819	503060	I just happened to find my knife over here.
503080	503861	That's why I sat down.
504141	505703	Loki's cutting things on cam.
505943	511968	www.orgsloungeradio.com And if somebody in studio pisses him off enough, they might get cut tonight.
512288	512668	We'll see.
512868	513369	Gotta expect.
516391	517112	They can't hear that.
518113	518633	Whatever.
518713	519594	I don't fucking care.
519614	519854	Okay.
520825	522445	Tonight is definitely one of those nights.
523826	525406	I want the world to die.
526046	533908	Everything good in this world needs to wither and die and stop spreading your goddamn pollen.
535268	535808	Please.
535968	538469	And the person in the chatroom named Come As You Are.
538989	539449	No script.
539569	540209	Bad.
540849	541829	Go ahead and boot their ass.
544030	544650	What the hell?
547113	548374	That calls for Instaban.
548734	550635	Anyway, we'll handle that.
551076	553517	As soon as we come back after these lovely songs.
554318	559681	In this break, random 2DX songs from Yonder Pass.
560142	562443	They're old 2DX songs that we don't play that often.
562803	567467	Because, you know, last week we had people bitching, You guys play the same songs all the time.
567507	568747	Every week we have to hear Skull.
568767	570188	Why don't you play something new?
570829	571209	So fine.
571729	572590	You get some random stuff.
572610	573491	We should play Girls.
574171	574411	No.
574932	575652	God damn it.
575832	576953	Let that die already.
577503	577944	No!
579785	587973	Alright, we'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio, maybe some Bomani news, some random video game stuff.
588294	594259	Jamie wants to take this show tonight in a really random video game direction, but I don't care, we're going to do it.
594660	597843	So stay tuned, we'll be back after this with Don't Stop!
648875	653036	I'll take you up, oh sweet baby As years go by
683410	683572	I win!
782092	782433	Thank you.
827419	827660	Thank you.
886370	887375	Thank you for watching!
921577	924175	Thanks for watching!
1026636	1028737	I love that promo because it's the only one we have.
1029458	1032360	It's the only promo we have where I get to hear Jamie click like a chicken.
1036142	1037823	I can't do any imitations right now.
1038504	1038684	Aww.
1039004	1039484	Except one.
1039965	1040165	What?
1043849	1044590	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1068182	1069504	It's the Grudge Show!
1069604	1071886	Who's soul will Tobio take today?
1074808	1084417	Starring... and... Oh, wow, we're dumb.
1084797	1085958	Anyway, here we are.
1087119	1090162	Another week is upon us here at the Orange Lounge Radio Headquarters.
1090939	1091679	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1113973	1114873	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1137475	1141677	So, I don't know, but they're cool, I like them, and I wanted to go see them play live.
1141977	1155903	Me and the boys were gonna go catch the Scissor Sister, like me and, you know, some of my friends, but we... I kind of made a mistake, because when I tried to go in and get tickets, the only tickets that were available were in, like, the back, back, back row.
1156163	1159344	Like, it was row, like, double Y in the second balcony, okay?
1159364	1160345	It was that far back.
1160665	1161125	And I was like...
1161772	1188532	Fuck that, I'm not going to get tickets if I have to sit that far back So I'm going to wait, because usually with concerts, this is a trick a lot of people don't know They'll open up better tickets like a week before Or, you know, sometimes you can get general admission So we were trying to get floor seats, but it never opened up I kept checking every day and I was not able to get better tickets So therefore I'm here tonight, where somewhere in the city, by the bay Scissor Sisters is taking the stage right now, and I'm not there
1189465	1191125	Therefore, I'm a little bit bitter tonight.
1191306	1194346	If I sound a little bit bitter, it's because I could be somewhere else.
1194987	1195407	That's alright.
1195427	1201368	We're going to start off tonight's show as we do every week, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.
1201428	1202569	Jamie, how was your week, how was your day?
1205530	1207210	I've been sneezing all fucking day.
1209771	1213552	I made it to level 10 in a week on fucking game.
1215820	1217321	Also known as Final Fantasy XI.
1218902	1220263	Been going to school.
1220724	1222065	My teacher's an asshole.
1222965	1225887	More like an elitist snob, but eh.
1228289	1229770	Just stuff, really.
1231111	1236014	I went bowling yesterday with Iguana Girl and Islander.
1236134	1236775	You went bowling?
1236875	1237455	I went bowling.
1237475	1239177	I scored five strikes my second game.
1239297	1239637	Nice.
1241638	1242619	Do you do the strike dance?
1242639	1242699	Yes.
1242998	1243699	Drake!
1244279	1244679	Did you do that?
1245380	1245560	No.
1245740	1247462	No.
1247542	1249103	Then we went to Mikuni.
1249703	1250784	Oh my god, Jamie.
1251185	1253146	We should start an Orange Lounge Bowling League.
1254367	1254807	Um, no.
1255788	1255928	No.
1256829	1257750	Come on!
1258370	1261233	We could all have orange bowling balls.
1261733	1262273	Come on.
1262514	1263154	It'd be cute.
1263254	1264195	And we could all have this... Rob.
1264815	1265116	Rob.
1265476	1265756	Rob.
1266016	1266257	Rob.
1267698	1268038	Rob.
1268278	1268578	What?
1269199	1269599	What?
1270120	1270360	No.
1270380	1270420	No.
1272318	1281764	Hey Rob, once I had a really good idea just like that, you know, it was to put a Russian space station around, you know, orbit, around Earth.
1281784	1283585	Yeah, that didn't turn out very well.
1283805	1284766	Let Jamie finish her week.
1285866	1290209	I've been sneezing all day.
1290469	1291710	Woke up with a cat on my head.
1293951	1298434	Um, I just, I'm done.
1299574	1301896	It's not very often that Jamie wakes up with pussy in her face.
1304079	1304659	You know what?
1306220	1306920	That wasn't funny.
1307921	1311602	I thought it was funny and I didn't even hear the... I was laughing before the joke.
1311742	1317464	The reaction we got in studio when I said that, just Jamie, she's got this very dead look on her face.
1317484	1320585	Like, you know, kind of like... You know, she's got that look on her face right now.
1320625	1321546	She's kind of leaning back.
1321986	1327068	She's staring off into space, staring at the ceiling, going, you know, I don't want to be here, type thing.
1327088	1331090	And then when I said that, you know... And she doesn't often get pussy on her face.
1331410	1331990	She's just kind of...
1332646	1335227	Reaches over and grabs the mic and goes, you know what?
1338569	1339889	No, my cat didn't poop.
1340449	1341070	That's sick.
1341430	1343230	Sometimes I wish we were a TV show.
1343270	1343831	I really do.
1345711	1356296	I've taken two doses of Advil cold sinus, a dose of Benadryl, and two doses of Tylenol allergy sinus.
1357836	1361498	I'm drugged, upset, I ate.
1361840	1364361	Three Lindered Chocolate Balls on the way here.
1365561	1366761	Were they salty chocolate balls?
1367021	1367421	Oh, hush.
1367961	1368782	They were dark chocolate.
1370722	1377264	And then I go look at my friends list to see freaking sluts on my friends list on my live journal.
1379144	1382705	I got sluts on my friends list too, but that's just how they... But I need pictures of sluts.
1382805	1384705	Oh, I'm like, these are actual people.
1385025	1386046	I just have to accept them.
1386066	1386746	That's the way they are.
1386766	1388066	I never get sluts on my friends list.
1390115	1391376	Oh, my life is miserable.
1391616	1393237	Join a couple gay live journal communities.
1393257	1394758	You can get tons of sluts on your friends' page.
1398200	1398480	No.
1399280	1409986	I need... Wow.
1411107	1411367	Wow.
1411707	1412688	Loki, how was your week?
1412728	1413288	How was your day?
1414609	1414689	Um...
1416138	1418019	Well, my week was okay.
1418539	1420399	Didn't really do too much.
1421459	1423780	Let's see.
1424280	1428121	Friday, Christopher brought over the parts for his PC, so I built that.
1428761	1432262	And that was fun, until I couldn't figure out why I wasn't booting.
1432282	1435323	It's because... Now...
1435888	1449355	The motherboard I bought has actually two different chipsets on it, you know, so you can run the older Athlon processors, and you can run the new 64-bit ones, the ones beside, you know, above 3.2 gigahertz or whatever.
1450616	1458901	So, anyways, I had the processor in the right one, but I had the RAM in the wrong set of slots there, so it wasn't booting up.
1459901	1462323	Finally figured that out after about six hours, and then...
1464793	1465654	Loaded that all up.
1465754	1466596	It looks really cool.
1481883	1488769	And then on my computer, which is sitting in the middle of the room right now, I installed the motherboard in that and cut the rest of the case.
1488789	1492112	So I'm pretty much ready to go with that.
1492132	1497397	I probably should set it up to install everything.
1497897	1501981	So I was messing around with that.
1502141	1503963	And then played lots of Final Fantasy.
1505324	1505524	And...
1507626	1511108	They didn't do too much else other than that.
1511208	1516471	The first night when Christopher brought his computer over on Friday, I stayed up until 6 in the morning.
1516971	1520373	And then last night I stayed up until 6 in the morning playing Final Fantasy.
1521273	1527417	So I'm kind of like my whole schedule is messed up right now.
1528397	1529598	I've been staying up way too late.
1531178	1532099	And you have to work tomorrow, huh?
1533101	1536842	Yeah, it's going to be great though because my co-worker's quitting.
1538522	1539783	So now they're going to be panicking.
1540503	1544444	And it's great because I'm just an observer in their panic.
1545164	1545884	So it'll be fun.
1546884	1550625	Then this week I have to go see the Kings in floor seats.
1551825	1558227	I hate the Kings, but I'm taking my mom because whatever, I couldn't really do much of these tickets, so.
1560430	1564293	Okay, DT says I should invest in a Mac Mini.
1564593	1566555	No, I'm sorry, I already have a toaster.
1566915	1569617	I don't need a piece of shit computer that's small.
1570098	1572299	Why do you hate Apple computers so much?
1572359	1578304	I mean, I remember the day I brought home my iPod, you were like... Okay.
1579076	1579696	I'll tell you why.
1580196	1585017	Back in the day when I had to do fucking school assignments at the Mac Lab at our school, okay?
1585277	1587258	I'll tell you what, those things are a piece of shit.
1587298	1589298	You put the disc in, the whole thing explodes.
1589738	1592899	That is pretty much how reliable Macintosh computers are.
1592939	1594799	They're computers for idiots!
1594859	1602281	But I remember in the computer school lab, the Macs, when you turn them on, you'd see the little picture of the computer and it had the little happy face.
1602301	1604501	You don't buy computers because they're cute!
1605141	1607643	You buy them because they work and they're functional.
1608064	1610205	You don't buy fucking cute computers.
1610846	1614229	You shouldn't choose a computer because, oh, it'll match my curtains.
1614609	1615309	Fuck that.
1616190	1622035	Okay, but it'll still get on the internet, and the fact that it matches the curtains is a plus.
1622055	1625638	Yeah, you know, an old 386 computer will get on the internet too, but you know what?
1625658	1626779	I'm not going to be using that.
1629601	1630802	They're good if you're a graphic artist.
1631348	1633610	A-ha, a-ha, good graphics.
1633650	1643558	And actually, you can link, for every Mac you have linked up, it will increase the entire processing power of the entire unit because of the dual processing system.
1643798	1646600	You can actually get more power out of a Mac than you can out of a PC.
1646620	1647641	You can do that with anything.
1648202	1650844	And they do the video editing really easy, really easy.
1651653	1652713	You can do that with anything.
1653333	1654614	You can film the kitty.
1654774	1663836	You can film your kitty cat and then really easily put it on your Mac and you can make little videos like my kitty and string it all together and then you put music in the background.
1664216	1665816	So cute and so easy on a Mac.
1666237	1667717	You can do that with Windows too.
1667757	1669357	Yeah, but everything crashes in Windows.
1669757	1671958	No, not everything crashes in Windows.
1672098	1674359	Everything crashes in Windows.
1674559	1675219	Don't get me wrong.
1675239	1675559	I love Windows.
1675579	1677039	Look at all those fucking games for the Macs.
1681047	1682148	Oh wait, no there isn't!
1682448	1683969	That's right, because they suck!
1685570	1686331	Now wait a minute, wait a minute.
1686671	1692535	Okay, I'll tell you what's cool about Macs, are the laptops, the little iBooks.
1693076	1696338	The little apple, when you use it on the back, it glows.
1697619	1701041	So, let's say you ever have to be in the dark.
1702202	1704324	The apple will glow, and it gives you... Shut up.
1704864	1705344	Stop.
1706545	1707106	But it's cute.
1710526	1712467	Have you ever been to the Apple Store at the mall?
1712647	1714227	It's blinding!
1714307	1716148	Here at the local mall, yeah, they have an Apple Store.
1716528	1718969	And I don't know how they light that thing.
1719109	1725872	I think they actually took a little chunk of the sun and put it inside the Apple Store because it is so freaking bright in there.
1729473	1732434	Yeah, it's like, you know... No, no, I'm sorry.
1732634	1737956	I am... I will never, ever, ever... I'm going down the record stands.
1738177	1739217	I will never own...
1739873	1741493	Anything that's made by Apple.
1742074	1742494	Nothing.
1743134	1744434	I'm not buying an iPod.
1744814	1745914	I'm not buying a computer.
1746075	1747855	I will not buy a laptop made by them.
1747955	1748295	Nothing.
1749235	1751596	Of course, Apple is a fully unsubsidiary of Microsoft.
1752536	1753036	You know what?
1754517	1756517	Did I say Microsoft?
1756757	1757677	I said Apple.
1760918	1761458	You know what?
1761838	1763699	You should hold your tongue and say Apple.
1763759	1764519	It's really funny.
1767980	1768400	Yeah.
1769370	1770011	Apple.
1771112	1774895	You know, I think I graduated from elementary school a while ago.
1776616	1779539	Of course, this is coming from someone who said that the chair was not green.
1781961	1782761	The chair's green.
1782821	1783722	I think the chair's green.
1783862	1784763	It's mostly black.
1784823	1786124	It's green!
1786184	1792229	If you take green, or black, and add a little bit of green to that, that is mainly black.
1792569	1794371	It's a night green.
1795984	1796524	You know what?
1796925	1797925	It's black, okay?
1798446	1802348	I will take a piece of that chair into a paint match store and we will settle this debate.
1802548	1803389	It's fucking black.
1803489	1804570	Just like my trench coat.
1804610	1807011	My trench coat's blue, but it's fucking black.
1807031	1809553	It looks black, therefore it's black, okay?
1809973	1812675	I don't care if it has a hint of green in it.
1812695	1813816	It's still black.
1813896	1814717	Hold on, hold on a minute.
1815717	1816618	It actually is more green.
1817138	1817658	Hold on a minute.
1821061	1821301	Whatever.
1821321	1822181	Hold on, hold on, I'm working.
1822842	1824083	No way, I want you to rant a little more here.
1824443	1825884	I'm just, you know, finding some music here.
1832048	1833709	The chair is green.
1834770	1835230	Black.
1835631	1836091	Green.
1836391	1836832	Black.
1836892	1837332	Green.
1837652	1838132	Black.
1840014	1841255	It's a goddamn chair!
1842456	1845358	If Justin Timberlake can be black, that chair can be black, okay?
1850581	1851302	Are you finished?
1851762	1851962	Yes.
1852383	1853223	Angel, how was your week?
1853243	1853824	How was your day?
1855125	1856746	Rob made my tongue numb.
1857326	1857487	Ah!
1858187	1859488	I don't even want to know how that happened.
1860205	1861486	Sorry, I won't bite so hard next time.
1861506	1862507	What are you talking about?
1864008	1864788	Stupid Altoids.
1866589	1867610	And that was your week and your day?
1868871	1869091	No.
1872473	1873294	Final Fantasy XI.
1876336	1879017	Unfortunately, when I was on, you guys weren't, because you guys had to work.
1880138	1885001	But then again, I had school, so... Not much happened.
1885242	1887223	And I'm supposed to say hi to Mikey, so hi Mikey!
1887938	1892840	otherwise known as BRPOhiovaMoney That's quick.
1894113	1895093	My week and my day.
1895633	1897254	Really, not a whole lot going on.
1897314	1899214	I did play a little bit of Final Fantasy.
1899494	1900775	I had days off, actually, this week.
1900795	1904796	I took Monday and Tuesday off of work, and oh my god, I had this big list of things I was going to do.
1905256	1911917	I was going to go to the mall, and I was going to go shopping, and there was all this stuff I wanted to buy, like new socks and underwear and things.
1912237	1920579	I was going to buy all this stuff at the mall, and then, let's see, I was going to go to Ikea one day, and then I was going to clean my room from top to bottom.
1920599	1923380	I had this big project where I was going to totally redo my room and clean it,
1924281	1928744	and I didn't get any of that done because I was leveling in Final Fantasy all day both days.
1934128	1935429	I think I'm just going to uninstall it.
1935570	1937051	Then I won't be tempted to play it anymore.
1940353	1944177	I'm seriously wondering how much would I get done if Final Fantasy XI wasn't installed.
1944437	1947099	You know what though, seriously, if it wasn't that, it would be some other game.
1947419	1949581	I'd go right back to playing Final Fantasy X or something.
1951849	1953910	Loki says, at least I'd finish the damn game.
1955391	1956311	Alright, whatever.
1956651	1961074	And now they're yelling at me, I can't uninstall the game.
1962594	1963335	Let's see, what else?
1963835	1965095	What else is going on in Rob's world?
1967997	1970018	Yesterday we went out to sushi, that was cool.
1970218	1976681	We went to wasabi, which is cool, because when you walk in the door, they all yell at you from behind the bar, WASABI!
1977842	1978962	When you walk in, WASABI!
1979803	1980063	WASABI!
1981983	1982983	And it always scares me.
1984024	1985524	It always scares me when I walk in there.
1985564	1986444	It's like, you know, I walk in.
1987404	1989305	I'm going to walk into a nice little sushi restaurant.
1989365	1992846	Are you sure they're not saying it ashamase?
1992866	1994246	I don't know.
1994506	1995466	It always sounds like wasabi.
1996607	1998107	I always thought they were saying the name of the restaurant.
1998787	2000668	Oh, because I know Mikuni does it.
2000688	2005549	It's like any time you go into an establishment, they're supposed to go ashamase, which is like welcome.
2006569	2006649	Oh.
2007341	2007801	What else?
2038041	2041843	I had this whole list of things I was going to talk about, but I can't think of any, so I guess we'll just have to move on.
2044084	2046605	I wish I had some exciting DDR story to tell, but I really don't.
2047246	2048186	I haven't been to the arcade in a while.
2048206	2049747	I'm still waiting for them to set up 2DX.
2050087	2051628	We're supposed to be getting 2DX here locally.
2051668	2052989	That was supposed to happen, what, four weeks ago?
2053669	2055810	I guess they're waiting on a part, so we'll see.
2056711	2057011	Loki?
2057331	2058071	Loki has a comment.
2060893	2061713	It'll never happen.
2062233	2063994	They'll just keep talking and hinting at it.
2064475	2067056	The monitor will constantly be in trend to us.
2067665	2068605	It'll never happen.
2068846	2070366	I took fucking pictures of it.
2071307	2072087	But there's no monitor.
2072948	2075069	The monitor's gone.
2075869	2076089	Okay.
2077070	2081212	You know... I don't know.
2081232	2082452	They should, like, ghetto rig it.
2086114	2087374	Pimp my 2DX machine.
2090256	2092857	Hey, what was that idea for a TV show you were talking about earlier this week?
2092877	2093657	I thought it was kind of cool.
2093697	2094598	Pimp my rig...
2097358	2098438	And what would happen on this show?
2099118	2102299	They would take someone's piece of shit computer and they'd make it pretty.
2103379	2104379	And they'd case mod it.
2105199	2106800	Kind of what you did to Christopher's computer this week.
2107300	2108660	Yeah, that's just building a computer.
2108680	2109700	But yeah, more or less.
2111260	2116681	It's just, um, I could see G4 doing this because they're retarded and want to rip off ideas from people, so why not?
2123123	2125503	Our show's come to a halt because I'm trying to give Jamie chocolate right now.
2127527	2129007	Gotta get your priorities in straight.
2131368	2132049	Chocolate first.
2133369	2135990	Legend of Zaku says he needs someone to pimp his PA skills.
2138431	2139192	Practice, practice.
2139992	2140612	That's what it takes.
2141453	2151057	If you want to join our chatroom and make random comments that we might read on air, join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat, and it's lots of fun.
2152103	2155086	El Mullet made it funny.
2155947	2158730	He says once they pimp it, they could call it an apple.
2162555	2163235	Oh, I'm sorry.
2163315	2168801	They're not removing all functionality out of it or replacing the innards with a toaster.
2170743	2173186	I remember the old GeForce, the transparent toasters.
2173406	2173987	Those are great.
2177358	2178578	Alright, we're going to go to a break.
2178598	2182059	When we come back from this break, I guess we'll talk about some DDR stuff.
2182899	2185760	There's some stuff going on in the Babani scene this week, and I suppose we can talk about it.
2186700	2187141	Might as well.
2188281	2190281	In this break, what?
2191522	2196643	Oh yeah, and Jamie has this really random Castlevania thing she wants to share with you guys, so we'll hook that up for later.
2197783	2203665	In this break, we're going to play some PlayStation 2DX songs, because I want to hear Cracker.
2204700	2207896	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio
2319138	2321887	Thanks for watching!
2427160	2429181	Lens Flasher and Destroyer
2515114	2516457	and Torture and Destroy.
2670795	2676660	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
2677040	2680883	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and Jamie...
2686059	2687780	wants to do something for you guys here.
2687800	2689001	This is a little bit random.
2689041	2694364	It doesn't really have to do with Bomani per se, but turn on the satanic music we've got there in the background.
2694384	2695044	It's not satanic.
2695124	2695824	It's churchy.
2695845	2696945	It sounds satanic to me.
2697065	2698726	I'm actually feeling better now that I stand up.
2699086	2699446	Oh, that's good.
2699567	2703569	But, you know, we've always made fun of Castlevania Symphony of the Night before the bad voice acting.
2703689	2705970	Right, and this has to do with the podcast from last week.
2705990	2707891	This kind of relates into the podcast.
2708291	2710533	And if you listen to it, you'd know what we were talking about.
2710573	2710953	Thank you.
2710973	2712073	That's the plug I was going to make.
2712434	2714695	If you haven't checked out the podcast yet...
2715242	2715662	Do it!
2716163	2718805	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Orange Lounge Radio to go.
2719065	2726530	There's a whole extra 20-minute show that we do, and we talk about random shit like this, such as the voice acting in Castlevania Symphony of the Night.
2726950	2728832	And a lot of you guys have played this game.
2729012	2730713	God, this song scares the shit out of me.
2732514	2737578	A lot of you... Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
2738218	2738899	It is holy.
2740245	2741206	Oh, I didn't know it was going through.
2741226	2741967	Yeah, it's already going through.
2741987	2742367	They can hear it.
2743408	2745129	The holiest of internet radio.
2745409	2745610	Anyway.
2745650	2746630	I'm going to go ahead and get started playing.
2746811	2747011	Okay.
2747551	2752475	So, you know the bad voice acting in Symphony of the Night is like, Die, monster.
2752996	2754157	You don't belong in this world.
2754737	2755278	It's really lame.
2755538	2761603	So anyway, Jamie said she wanted to play for you all how much better the Japanese voice acting is.
2762418	2763999	So she's going to do that for you guys.
2764299	2765539	Now, this is the cool thing.
2765639	2779466	If you're listening live on Sunday night, which I know obviously right now you are, but some of you guys hear this show on the rebroadcast over on DDR Freak Radio and all that stuff, you can actually see it on our webcam, www.orangehornsradio.com.
2780751	2788155	I would appreciate it, however, though, if people save copies of them, I will put this up somewhere for people to see the images.
2788475	2794399	Now, Misty is our usual webcam whore, and she's not here tonight, so hopefully somebody else is saving pictures.
2794919	2797961	Save the pictures, and after the show, I'll give you my email address.
2803103	2804024	One gay man.
2805152	2808873	One angsty woman and one angry man.
2809533	2811273	Orange Lounge Radio.
2811513	2812233	Coming to a theater near you.
2812253	2812853	I see the story on here.
2812893	2814674	You know how they give you the whole story?
2815234	2817274	It actually is different, but it's still written in English.
2818314	2823615	But they say it as your... Okay.
2823655	2826416	Now, you actually have to play the game for a little bit to get to the opening.
2826836	2829076	You just wanted to play games on Orange Lounge Radio.
2832237	2833517	Isn't this an Akira Yamaoka track?
2835174	2835494	I don't know.
2838116	2843419	Isn't this great?
2843660	2850524	You guys are tuned into an internet radio station, and you're not even watching somebody play games.
2850584	2851165	Oh, here we go.
2851225	2851745	Destroy!
2852706	2854107	This is not the world you live in!
2854247	2858529	I will not be revived by my own power.
2858549	2859910	I will be revived by greedy humans.
2865353	2867214	Power is the only justice.
2867274	2869275	That's your own way of saying it.
2869295	2873297	People seek each other under the same belief, unite, and walk.
2873357	2882242	However, humans have developed by desire, and have been defeated by faith.
2882262	2887024	Humans cannot be defeated by power alone.
2887204	2887665	Uyamae,
2895157	2896558	Wow, that was very scary.
2896618	2902940	And now you're doing the little battle in the beginning, right?
2916124	2917485	I recognize one part.
2917785	2918505	I recognize one part.
2918685	2920286	And that's when the little glass breaks.
2920826	2922447	Because I remember that in the English version.
2922807	2923668	What is a man?
2923688	2926509	Oops.
2926609	2929350	Ooh.
2933512	2934373	How cool he says what?
2936174	2936794	Hydro Storm.
2947146	2948147	That was very hot.
2965290	2969492	Symphony of the Night is like the sex... I mean, I know this isn't Symphony of the Night, but I'm used to Symphony of the Night.
2969792	2971692	It has the sexiest music.
2971912	2973233	God, the music is so good.
2973353	2976434	Translation, because they changed it.
2976734	2984557	After a series of epic battles, Richter Velma finally succeeded in destroying Count Dracula, the ancient vampire who had been the most recently resurrected by the Dark Priest Shaft.
2984997	2989559	However, one night, four years later, under the bright glare of the moon, Richter mysteriously vanished.
2989619	2992880	With no idea of where to begin her search, Maria Renard set out to look for him.
2993300	2994541	It was then that fate intervened.
2995051	3001936	Castlevania, The Castle of Dracula, which is rumored to appear only once every century, suddenly and mysteriously materialized.
3001976	3003197	More text.
3003277	3006480	Meanwhile, powerful forces were at work in the life of a man named Alucard.
3006980	3010943	The very same Alucard who had previously teamed up with Ralph C. Belmont
3011683	3015344	to destroy his immortal father, Vlad Tepesov, aka Count Dracula.
3015944	3022366	Alucard, in order to rid the world of his own first bloodline, sealed off his powers and entered into what was supposed to be an eternal slumber.
3024726	3026687	At the end of this is the line that they pissed off that they changed.
3027227	3032768	But now that sleep had been disturbed, Alucard is aware of the evil that has once again arisen in his homeland.
3033028	3037150	The time has come once more for the forces of good and evil to engage in their ancient battle.
3037450	3038830	Dracula's castle beckons for you.
3039497	3042679	and perhaps none but that bright and glaring moon can say who will triumph.
3042859	3043900	They changed that line.
3043980	3044741	That pissed me off.
3044761	3045901	That was so awesome.
3045981	3047642	This is just like watching Iron Chef.
3048703	3051905	And the secret ingredient?
3052185	3052786	Potato!
3054747	3055908	Let me bite this pepper.
3058489	3060831	And it says Dracula X. That's so awesome.
3062572	3066074	This is actually supposed to be on the 32X.
3069875	3070836	You know?
3070996	3071316	Alright.
3072257	3072517	Lovely.
3074039	3083126	You know, all I gotta say is, uh... Who's the man?
3083587	3085628	The resurrected Dracula?
3086329	3086769	Shit!
3089111	3089892	Can you dig it?
3090833	3091533	Oh, yeah.
3094896	3096017	You're a dumbass.
3097638	3098259	Alright, alright.
3099762	3100242	Anyway.
3100262	3105345	Gave me just one excuse to play video games during the show.
3106485	3106785	Alright.
3108066	3108986	That was pretty cool, though.
3109066	3111347	I'd actually never heard that, the Japanese version.
3111507	3114309	I think maybe you sent me bits and pieces, like on Wave.
3114909	3119511	I had a file of Alucard, though, because I figured we wouldn't be getting to the part with Alucard, so I brought a file with him.
3120071	3122192	Did you want me to play that little Wave sample?
3123073	3123693	In just a sec.
3123873	3124133	Okay.
3125674	3126294	A little bit there.
3127655	3127795	Ugh.
3131055	3133376	We'll be talking about Bomani News at some point this evening, too.
3133416	3135718	But let's face it, you know, there hasn't been a new game lately.
3135778	3137519	Well, actually, there was a big new game this week.
3139320	3141561	We don't really have an excuse to not be talking Bomani.
3143722	3144603	We'll get to it, though.
3144623	3145243	We will, we will.
3147464	3152147	Of course, Castlevania, I mean, a lot of you guys that play DDR, I know a lot of you guys are into Castlevania, too.
3152167	3153128	And if you're not, you should be.
3153368	3155649	Because the music's good, the gameplay's good.
3155789	3156330	Oh, yes, Jamie.
3156350	3157090	The file of Alucard?
3157350	3157550	Yes.
3158411	3158891	You want it now?
3159171	3159351	Yeah.
3160092	3160352	Here it is.
3162042	3164503	That's it.
3165103	3175310	But see, isn't the voice acting better?
3176090	3180233	But see, there's something about the American voice acting that's very charming.
3180653	3181633	Die, monster!
3181794	3183354	You don't belong in this world!
3183655	3184135	It's cute.
3184155	3185876	Well, excuse me, Richter.
3192453	3193133	Oh, boy, oh, boy.
3194394	3194754	All right.
3195855	3198717	Loki's going to hook the webcam back up so you can stare at the couch again.
3199037	3199958	I'm going to check on my laundry.
3200178	3200498	All right.
3200538	3203220	Meanwhile, we're going to talk a little bit about some Bomani news.
3203240	3206442	There actually was a little bit of news this week, and we can talk about that.
3207443	3208264	This isn't Bomani.
3208324	3210465	Okay, I'll talk about the Castlevania thing real fast.
3210846	3214708	But you know that Konami was making this big announcement on Thursday.
3215088	3217210	They were going to make a big announcement on January 27th, right?
3217250	3217370	Well...
3220379	3223561	It turned out that the big announcement was just their 2005 lineup.
3223741	3226363	So, you know, you can see all the new Konami games that are coming out in 2005.
3227464	3237630	And, of course, as suspected, and if you were paying attention to OrangeLawnRadio.com throughout the week, you already knew this, but one of the games they announced was Castlevania Curse of Darkness, which is going to be a brand new PlayStation 2 title.
3238550	3238950	Very cool.
3238970	3241232	And that's in addition to the DS Castlevania game.
3241493	3243014	So it's going to be a big year for Castlevania.
3243054	3243774	That's going to be cool.
3244095	3245276	And then they announced some other games.
3245456	3246997	Ninja Turtles game is in there.
3248138	3248779	What else was there?
3248819	3253002	There was a new Frogger game.
3253102	3255244	Oh, and of course, Metal Gear Acid for the PSP.
3255284	3256165	We all knew that was coming.
3256685	3257886	So they announced all these games.
3258847	3262570	And then what was weird is that the same day, the exact same day,
3263346	3266548	in unrelated news, but they put out a press release on this.
3266888	3269509	They did not announce any new DDR titles.
3269549	3271610	They did not announce any Extreme 2.
3271971	3273871	They did not announce Ultramix 3.
3274212	3277153	They didn't announce DDR with Mario for the US.
3277173	3278374	They didn't announce any of that stuff.
3278854	3284957	But what they did do is that they published this press release saying, Hey, guess what, kids?
3285497	3291541	Dance Dance Revolution sold 1.2 million copies in North America in 2004.
3293382	3302185	Now, that's across all titles, so we're talking Extreme and Ultramix 2 combined, along with Ultramix 1 and Max 2.
3302565	3311289	All those combined, all those sales totaled 1.2 million, but really, for a game that requires an additional peripheral to play, not too shabby.
3311749	3314610	Certainly higher sales than any Power Pad game ever got, right?
3315130	3316791	So that was 1.2 million copies in 2004.
3318260	3333120	since DDR debuted in 2001 all the way back on Dance Dance Revolution on the Playstation 2.5 million copies of DDR games for the home consoles in the US sold not too shabby right?
3334585	3337787	But then they didn't announce a new DDR game to go along with that.
3337827	3340088	They just said, gee, isn't DDR great?
3340468	3342149	But honestly, think about it, people.
3342529	3349834	Are they going to submit this press release and then say, oh, and by the way, because of DDR's great success, no more DDR games in the U.S.
3349914	3350394	It's done.
3350654	3351955	We're pulling the plug on DDR.
3352435	3353716	We're going out on the top.
3353796	3354136	That's right.
3354616	3359239	We're like a TV sitcom like Friends or something.
3359259	3361120	We're going to go out while we're still on top.
3362506	3363747	I don't think so, boys and girls.
3363827	3365027	It's not quite how it works.
3365528	3374072	You can bet your sweet ass that we will see new games on PlayStation and Xbox this year, and we will probably see that GameCube game as well.
3374252	3376333	I think it's just a foregone conclusion.
3376713	3381255	We just have to sit here and twiddle our thumbs until the details are announced, which probably won't be until E3.
3383236	3383577	Honestly.
3384017	3384537	And that's that.
3385598	3386718	Anything you want to add to that, Loki?
3387318	3388279	What's a GameCube?
3389900	3390400	Smartass.
3393726	3395087	Jamie, anything you want to add to that?
3397769	3399490	Aren't you excited about new DDRM consoles?
3399650	3402612	I am, if I... Yeah, I am.
3403052	3403933	Now, this is what I'm thinking.
3404253	3409057	How many copies of a video game do you think it would take to sell to call it a success?
3410418	3413440	A success... How many copies does a successful video game sell?
3414220	3414440	Two.
3415401	3415721	Come on.
3416622	3416742	Like 100,000?
3416782	3417062	That's decent.
3417082	3418943	100,000 would be really decent, right?
3418963	3419043	Now...
3421858	3444553	If one out of every ten people that bought DDR 2004 were to support a, I don't know, another music game that Konami would put out, say, Beatmania 2DX, if you could convince one out of every ten people that bought DDR that Beatmania 2DX is a good idea, one out of every ten, you'd have a successful game on your hands.
3445194	3451218	If you could say, convince those same one out of ten people to, I don't know, say support an online,
3452614	3457058	Music game related radio show, we would be rich.
3461161	3462062	Yeah, I know, I know.
3462962	3463603	Man can dream.
3464143	3471049	Whereas the figure is actually more like one out of every million actually support that internet.
3471089	3472170	Because that would make it what, two?
3472310	3473751	Yeah, that's about how many listeners we have, two.
3477344	3477644	Alright.
3478784	3497749	And everyone else is expecting to hear Tomosuke and the rest of the Orange Lounge Radio band because they think that this shows... You know, there's been so many people out there that have actually thought that Orange Lounge Radio is related to Orange Lounge that we finally put a disclaimer on the website at the very, very bottom in little text.
3497989	3498309	Note.
3499109	3504070	Orange Lounge Radio is not affiliated with Orange Lounge the band from DDR and 2DX and all that.
3506291	3506631	Sorry.
3508108	3509590	Tomosuke does have his own site.
3509690	3510250	It's out there.
3510370	3511891	We had a link to it once.
3513072	3517356	Just put Orange Lounge into Google and it's the site that comes up before Orange Lounge Radio.
3517916	3518096	Yes.
3519638	3522720	Before I let my pet peeve bug me anymore, it's Tomosuke.
3523341	3523601	Sorry.
3525662	3526023	I'm white.
3528345	3528665	All right.
3530819	3532219	I don't know why.
3532299	3537981	I know a lot of people have this fear that if they bring out 2DX in America, it's going to be fucked up.
3538581	3539761	But I kind of don't care.
3539921	3541341	I just really want them to do it.
3543042	3547343	Even if it isn't as good as 2DX 7th, 8th, 9th style that's coming out soon.
3547643	3550744	Even if it's not that good, give us some new songs.
3550824	3551784	Give us something.
3552504	3553604	Something to make it US.
3554104	3554765	I'd be happy.
3554825	3557025	A lot of people would be very, very happy if you do it.
3558746	3559386	That's my plea.
3559846	3560326	What can you do?
3563934	3564254	Alright.
3565235	3569717	Any other comments on Beatmania 2DX USA and the hopes and dreams of seeing it happen?
3569737	3570317	We wish, we wish.
3570678	3570958	I know.
3572178	3573639	Not gonna happen, but whatever.
3573759	3575960	See, now Jamie... Listen up, pessimist.
3576461	3581003	Jamie, you usually prefer the Japanese mixes to American mixes, usually.
3581483	3581964	Absolutely.
3582544	3585406	But you still would want to see a 2DX US mix.
3585686	3586166	Absolutely.
3586266	3586446	Why?
3587247	3588227	Just to have it out here.
3589088	3591109	Another 2DX game to waste my money on, exactly.
3591129	3591589	Seriously.
3592748	3594549	I still have to find a copy of Fourth Style somewhere.
3598390	3600091	And I understand what they're saying in the chatroom there.
3600111	3604012	They're saying, if you were to bring 2DX to the US, it would have to appeal to the US gamers.
3605112	3610234	You only have to appeal to one out of every ten people that bought DDR last year to make this game a success.
3610274	3611095	That's all I'm saying.
3613195	3614776	One out of every ten should not be that hard.
3615216	3619838	If Donkey Konga can be a success, 2DX can be a success.
3619898	3620338	You know it.
3623277	3624077	I know this in my heart.
3624318	3633822	A lot of 2DX elitists I'm not saying everybody that plays 2DX is a 2DX elitist but a lot of 2DX elitists out there would have you believe that the masses don't want to eat up a game like 2DX.
3635843	3642547	But whenever I play 2DX in the arcades there's always these people that stand around kind of watching going ooh ah just like with DDR.
3643447	3645288	It's got a lot of that same appeal to it.
3646969	3647309	I don't know.
3648770	3649130	We'll see.
3650891	3652372	We're going to take a break.
3652392	3652932	We'll be back
3654229	3654549	Allie Japan
3683059	3685093	And we'll be back after this.
3719781	3721002	Thank you for watching!
3849703	3850950	You gotta move it, move it now
3926409	3927971	Thank you for watching!
3953229	3953791	Thanks for watching!
4025715	4026739	Thanks for watching!
4074935	4078459	Whoops, forgot to queue up a promo there that says we're coming back.
4078579	4079000	My bad.
4081843	4083085	Let me put something up there.
4090270	4098876	Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
4098917	4104941	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
4105902	4106422	There we go.
4107603	4108444	Now we can come back.
4109024	4109785	Hello, boys and girls.
4113163	4116486	You know the DDR Freak was down earlier this evening, but it's back up now.
4116646	4118007	I guess they were having some server problems.
4118328	4121451	DDR Freak was down, and then didn't you try to get on Bomani Style, and they were down too?
4121891	4122932	Everybody's broken!
4123713	4124473	They all broke!
4127436	4127916	What can you do?
4128697	4132300	But now the DDR Freak is back up.
4133561	4136704	I went over to the Mod of the Month thread, and I voted for Jamie.
4137445	4138466	I voted for you for Mod of the Month.
4138820	4139181	Thank you.
4139361	4140283	I'm not going to win.
4140524	4142849	I know you're not because a bunch of people went in there and flooded for somebody else.
4143189	4143811	But that's okay.
4143831	4144873	You should still vote for Jamie.
4146156	4146436	Do it.
4146777	4147038	Do it.
4148721	4148962	All right.
4150529	4156492	Anyway, I was asked to pass along our buddy Explicit, who's usually here at the show.
4156592	4158193	You know, he has a lot of FUs.
4158513	4169399	He sent along a little private message to me over on Orange Lounge Radio, and he wanted me to share some stuff with you guys about the upcoming tournament that's happening on, what, Saturday?
4169899	4171420	This Saturday, Saturday, February 5th.
4171620	4172921	Piss is happening this Saturday.
4172941	4173661	I'm so excited.
4174242	4175823	Paradise Island, SmackDown Sackdown...
4180080	4182601	If I have a lot to drink tonight, piss might happen even earlier.
4185622	4190763	The Paradise Island Sacktown Smackdown is happening this Saturday, February 5th.
4191824	4193904	And they're going to have the P.A.
4193964	4196345	and Demonium, like Pan-Demonium, get it?
4196385	4196865	P.A.
4196985	4197545	and Demonium?
4197625	4198086	Pan-Demonium?
4198766	4200006	That's their version of Perfect Attack.
4200646	4203867	And they're going to have a Showstopper Freestyle Contest, that should be fun.
4204187	4209109	And, get your rice rockets ready, an initial D Grand Prix.
4210222	4211823	Joy and joy, that should be fun.
4212023	4213183	Golden showers for all.
4219805	4222707	Explicit asked me to pass along some updates to the tournament.
4223487	4226288	They've actually lowered some of the prices, which is nice.
4226548	4234871	So if you were thinking about it, they've actually lowered the price to get into freestyle and try to pull up the latest update.
4237021	4242963	And let's see, freestyle price has been reduced to $10, only $8 if you're pre-registered.
4243363	4252626	So if you want to pre-register, go to DDR Freak, now that it's back up, go to DDR Tournament Chat, or whatever that forum's called, and look for the Paradise Island thread.
4252646	4260408	And yes, I know that's a local tournament, so those of you guys on the East Coast probably are not feasibly going to be going to this, but I did promise we would put that little local plug.
4261669	4265030	And at some point during the tournament, I do plan on making a cameo.
4266721	4268683	I'm gonna dabble in the piss for a little bit.
4270184	4271245	Are you gonna get your hands wet?
4271265	4273247	I'm gonna get my hands wet at piss.
4274688	4275288	Okay, we'll stop.
4275468	4275889	Seriously.
4279372	4279792	Oh, damn.
4281914	4282875	Looking forward to piss.
4282935	4283415	It'll be fun.
4284696	4287358	But don't call it that in front of him because he'll get really mad.
4288459	4290301	He was a really good sport here at the show the other week.
4292236	4292817	DDR scene this week.
4316559	4323202	Yeah, they announced their new Dancing Stage game, which I remember had a really dumb name to it.
4323562	4328844	It's not Dancing Stage Fusion, it's like Dancing Stage Happy Fun Time.
4328864	4331185	I don't know what the hell it's called, but it's like something.
4331969	4336311	Anyways, and it's got all the crap that was in... It's Dancing Stage Fusion.
4336711	4337991	No, it's not Dancing Stage Fusion.
4338051	4339152	It's called something else.
4339892	4341313	Hold on, I'm going to look at these pictures here.
4341993	4343754	Oh, Dancing Stage Dayglo Mix.
4343834	4344154	Was that it?
4344174	4344854	Dayglo Mix.
4344894	4345654	That's what it was.
4345995	4346615	No, no, no.
4346675	4348836	That was what somebody said they should call it.
4348916	4350096	That's not what they really call it.
4350296	4355318	Because if you go and you look at the pictures of the cabinet... Let's see.
4355458	4356459	It's Dancing Stage Fusion.
4356779	4359960	That's what somebody on Freak said it should be called because of the way it looked.
4360658	4362219	Dancing Stage Fusion
4387991	4413128	321 Stars, A, A Stupid Barber, Across the Nightmare, AM3P, Be Lovin', Believe, Can't Stop Falling in Love, Speed Mix, Candy Star, Colors for Extreme, Destiny Lovers, Dive, Dynamite Rave, Soda Mix, Firefly, Familiar Feeling, whatever that is, Healing Vision, Angelic Mix, Heaven and Earth, which I think is a licensed song, It's Rain and Men, you know that one, Kakumei,
4413735	4414415	Keep on moving.
4414735	4419096	Kids in America, Ladies Night, La Senorita and La Senorita Virtual.
4419356	4421937	And Ladies Night, we do want to mention is Atomic Kitten.
4422237	4429978	Make It Better, Make It Better So Real Mix, Mickey, Orion 7-8 Civ Mix, Paranoia Max Dirty Mix, Rapper's Delight.
4431019	4433599	Dude, that was in Dancing Stage Fusion.
4433619	4434799	I know, how cool.
4435620	4442021	Still in My Heart, Sync, Tomorrow Perfume, Tough Enough, Trip Machine.
4443024	4470699	try to love you une, deux, trois waiting for tonight you're not here and your reign the rage mix and that's not all of them that's just what was on the demo cabinet that they had that's not everything that's going to be on the mix there's a lot more stuff so it looks pretty good so far but I mean granted it's just exactly like Dancing Stage Fusion or DDR Extreme you know the home versions
4472213	4474995	But hey, it's something new, so, yay!
4475915	4477356	I wonder if they're going to bring anything over here.
4477616	4478196	Probably not.
4478817	4480958	Who knows, you might get lucky, someone might import it.
4481158	4481858	I don't see why not.
4481938	4488822	I mean, people import stuff from, you know, Korea and, you know, China and Japan and stuff.
4489222	4490283	Why not from Europe?
4490383	4491784	I mean, makes sense to me.
4493445	4494886	But, that's what's going on.
4496186	4500849	And, um, no real, I don't think they really announced when, um...
4503722	4507465	They're going to be releasing that, but we're thinking probably the end of this year.
4509547	4510848	Oh, I think it'll be sooner than that.
4512989	4513289	Whatever.
4513510	4515631	You know they were showing In The Groove at this show, too.
4516852	4517493	Yeah, that was right.
4518113	4532744	The In The Groove was being shown by, I forget what company it was, they had boasted that their, what was it, they have, at the show they had gotten 200 orders for In The Groove
4533271	4535973	I don't want to have another In The Groove debate on this show.
4535993	4538174	Maybe they'll fix some of the problems with 1 and 2.
4557439	4565342	The longer and longer this goes on, the more and more I'm buying into the theory of Konami, that's what you get for not putting out any more arcade mixes.
4565502	4569003	Honestly, they deserve in the groove to be out there at this point.
4569143	4570603	I just, I don't know.
4571224	4575185	But I still think if they try to release in the groove on a home console, there's going to be issues.
4575685	4576365	I still say that.
4577025	4579986	And you can argue all you want, but I'm welcome to my opinion.
4580987	4582047	I can't wait for them to try.
4582843	4588568	I hope they do try to release on a home console so we can have this debate and get it over with.
4590429	4591130	Seriously.
4592471	4595873	If anything, to watch a show like X-Play rip it apart.
4596894	4597535	Well, I don't know.
4597755	4598615	I don't know if they would.
4599116	4603079	I mean, the casual gamer doesn't give a shit.
4604760	4605060	Right?
4605180	4605481	True.
4606221	4612166	That's how pieces of crap like Britney's Dance Beat get out there and get played.
4612845	4621608	I mean, people call Pump It Up that dance game and don't realize the differences between that... You know, whatever happened to fucking Pump It Up coming to the Japanese PlayStation 2?
4622429	4624869	That's a game that should be, you know, fucking brought over here.
4625290	4631392	I mean, it's doing well in, like, all these other countries, but, you know, no one wants to bring it over here, obviously, because of the lawsuits and shit.
4631832	4634533	But yet, stuff like, you know, fucking...
4636075	4641421	I don't understand how one can be okay and the other one can't.
4642122	4642783	You see what I'm saying?
4644505	4644825	I don't know.
4647148	4649931	So, I don't get it, but nothing's going on.
4651741	4656283	Alright, I promised that we would open up the Skype line, so that's exactly what I'm going to do.
4656343	4662686	If you want to call into the show, head on over to www.orangelonsradio.com and click on Interact With Us.
4663126	4671770	I do request, Skype actually upgraded to version 1.1 earlier this week, or no, I'm sorry, actually it was earlier this month, it was a little while ago.
4672430	4676912	And they have some new features in it, so make sure you upgrade the latest version.
4677292	4678313	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4679969	4680910	Agent Izaku here.
4681150	4682671	Hello, Izaku, how are you?
4683852	4684173	Fine.
4684593	4685213	What's on your mind?
4686194	4690318	Well, I'm just looking over, you know, now that DDR Freak went back up again.
4690958	4700626	I was looking over the Dancing States thread, and apparently, to my surprise, during the... For some reason, during the whole event, I looked at, you know, I saw two pictures.
4700846	4705070	One of a person, you know, one of the, you know, Konami's area where they had fusion...
4706811	4718114	It's one of the most recent posts on the thread, I know what you're talking about.
4718974	4721194	Yes, and I'm surprised.
4721234	4723475	I thought we were supposed to be behind something like this 100%.
4725275	4725715	I don't get it.
4726415	4734817	Well, from the looks of it, it looks like there was some type of event going on at the Pump It Up booth.
4735865	4737206	And so all those people were there.
4737427	4740249	And whereas Dancing Stage just kind of had the machine out there.
4741010	4741310	Hmm.
4742071	4742491	I don't know.
4742511	4744753	I guess, I don't know if I should accept that as an excuse.
4744813	4750378	Anyways, now that we have, now that DDR itself already hit at least 1.3 billion last year.
4750499	4759587	You know what, Zach, I just want to say, for all you know, I mean, we don't know because we weren't there, but for all we know, there was a topless girl playing Pump It Up at that moment.
4760373	4760713	Really?
4762434	4763074	For all you know.
4763094	4766956	So you don't know why all those people were there, but that's one possible reason.
4768197	4771218	If you look at the picture, they all kind of have that, ooh, boobies look on their face.
4771318	4771619	Right.
4772879	4787687	Anyways, now that DDR has already sold 1.2 million last year, totaling up to 2.5 million, which, if I'm not mistaken, should almost count for a quarter of all DDR sales worldwide.
4787707	4787947	Right.
4788936	4790258	I don't have the latest figures, but sure
4807347	4811190	And so, I don't know, there has to be something done, some sort of action.
4811871	4814773	We already know people, you know, who can make it happen.
4814813	4822199	We just gotta, you know, push, you know, we gotta basically, you know, we just gotta stay on top of this 110%.
4822519	4824200	You know what I'm saying?
4824921	4825661	I hear what you're saying.
4825762	4827483	Honestly, you're preaching to the choir here.
4828143	4829004	You're preaching to the choir here.
4829024	4830125	I'm not gonna disagree with you.
4830245	4831806	You are absolutely right.
4832046	4834008	I think that we need to be doing a new USA Mix.
4834929	4835549	We have just...
4837097	4845439	I think that the people who have made it happen previously are trying to make it happen again.
4845699	4847840	I don't know this for a fact, but I would assume.
4848360	4850961	I know that there's people that love DDR trying to make it happen.
4851821	4858183	I don't doubt that they're trying again, but sometimes it's a matter of it's just got to be the right time.
4858243	4859964	You've got to get the people to say the right thing.
4860504	4861584	I don't know what it's going to take.
4863061	4874067	But you don't see Silent Scope websites out there with 50,000 dedicated members.
4874747	4878629	To my knowledge, there is no internet radio station dedicated to the game Silent Scope.
4879890	4881110	And there's two for DDR.
4881151	4882431	We can definitely start.
4882471	4883112	We could start one.
4883132	4884552	Exactly, but this is a cult following.
4884592	4885653	You have a game here that...
4888447	4890129	That's the thing, you have a cult following.
4890430	4895416	You have people who love this game to the point that it consumes their lives to an extent.
4896517	4902685	And they basically have purpose to make something happen.
4903266	4906631	And in this case, we could go after a new arcade mix.
4907611	4908912	What was that?
4909112	4909452	Basically.
4938153	4943380	I doubt I would see something that perfect, but you know, it's worth a shot.
4943880	4947645	I think the most we can do as fans right now, continue to support the games.
4947985	4957337	When the home mixes come out, buy the new home mixes as they come out, support the arcade mixes that are already out there, and just keep showing that there's...
4958295	4959816	Demand out there for dance games.
4960096	4969460	And I hate to say it, but maybe supporting In The Groove, God, I can't believe I just said that, would show folks that there's still a demand out there for dance games.
4969921	4971962	Although, I don't know.
4972042	4974103	I mean, I still have mixed feelings on In The Groove.
4974583	4974923	Yeah.
4976684	4976964	Alright.
4977324	4979165	Well, I'm going to let you go, buddy, because we've got connection issues.
4979185	4987389	I understand what you're saying, and I hope we can all band together in one happy Bamani Rainbow family.
4988171	4988792	Take care, Zaku.
4989713	4990173	Have a good one.
4991815	4992655	I think he was behind.
4993136	4994918	I think he, like, it was weird.
4995098	4997220	I think he was hearing us about five seconds after we said something.
4997240	4998301	Maybe that's a weird Skype thing.
4998321	4998641	I don't know.
4999522	5000803	Anything you guys want to add to that?
5003506	5003646	No?
5004607	5004887	Alright.
5006108	5008751	Well, Skype line's open again if somebody else wants to give us a call.
5009978	5012019	We certainly would love to hear what you have to say.
5012680	5015922	Otherwise, I guess we're going to go ahead and get into the Orange Launch Radio cage match next.
5015942	5017002	That would be something exciting.
5019124	5021105	I'm checking out what's going on in the chat room there.
5021125	5029870	Basically, the chat room just kind of saying, didn't so-and-so say that there was going to be a new mix?
5030491	5032272	Didn't so-and-so say this?
5033372	5036194	Honestly, until Konami puts out the press release, it's all hearsay.
5040069	5042091	Hey, what's going on?
5042111	5042451	This is Phoenix.
5042471	5042531	Hey.
5042551	5043432	What's on your mind?
5070779	5071099	Hello?
5071339	5071839	What's on your mind?
5074980	5075540	Can you hear me, buddy?
5075580	5076080	What's on your mind?
5076400	5077301	Hey, what's going on?
5077681	5078101	Not much.
5078181	5080621	Just wanted to say hey to Jamie.
5080801	5081682	Hope she's feeling better.
5081942	5083182	I don't know.
5083662	5084622	Just chilling out, you know?
5084782	5085622	Listening to the show.
5086363	5089403	Jamie's in the kitchen getting herself a drink so she can feel a little better there.
5090544	5090704	Yeah.
5092124	5092184	Um.
5094128	5094789	Anything on your mind?
5094849	5098310	Any comments, response to things we've been talking about in the show so far?
5098410	5100470	Such as the new Europe DDR mix?
5101531	5103071	I don't know.
5103331	5105892	There just needs to be a new DDR for the US.
5106012	5108833	It's just bogus that they would just drop it like that.
5110239	5111660	Well, there will be a new U.S.
5111740	5112000	mix.
5112060	5113200	It's just the home.
5113280	5115081	It's kind of focused on home right now.
5115161	5116002	It is kind of weird.
5116362	5118883	Well, if you think about it, though, the U.S.
5118983	5121524	arcade mix has stopped a long, long time ago.
5121564	5122045	They really did.
5122085	5124366	We only ever had one true U.S.
5124466	5126787	arcade mix, and it was kind of a mediocre game at best.
5127627	5129748	But it's the Japanese ones that have really stopped.
5130609	5133190	Yeah, it was sort of shaky there, but I don't know.
5133230	5136631	I think they could do, if they really wanted to, they could do what they wanted.
5136791	5137952	They could come out with a good one.
5138525	5139346	I know, I know.
5139466	5148573	And you know what's interesting, though, is that you don't see Konami of Japan putting out this press release going, ooh, DDR Festival sold 1.2 million copies.
5149033	5150374	You didn't see that press release.
5151195	5152096	Yeah, that is true.
5152216	5153537	I mean, I don't know.
5154538	5155438	I don't know.
5155739	5161663	It just seems like a lot of this stuff is going down, like those websites that got shut down the other night.
5162644	5163064	What was it?
5163224	5164305	DDR UK and stuff?
5166107	5166267	What...
5166840	5169102	Are you talking about DDRUK getting shut down?
5169662	5171604	Yeah, those websites getting shut down.
5171664	5174186	Yeah, but we know that it has nothing to do with Konami.
5174226	5179010	That was more of the MP3s in the songpacks, at least assumably.
5179070	5183714	Now, we're making a lot of assumptions here, but assumably, it was the MP3s that were inside the songpacks.
5184014	5191140	And remember that, if I'm not mistaken, Loki, correct me if I'm wrong, I wasn't a big DDRUK user, but they didn't just have the official songpacks.
5191200	5193422	They had fan ones too, right?
5193522	5194303	Am I correct?
5194323	5195924	Because they did contests and stuff, right?
5196769	5207577	They didn't have those, but they had links to the Shoei, whatever, his little sim file museum stuff, which I'm sure had a lot of crap in it.
5208098	5209799	Yeah, well, I don't know.
5210099	5216925	I would just, I think Step Mania and stuff like that, people are going to get into that more and move that way.
5217585	5219727	You know, because that's customizable to how you want it.
5220862	5229726	And I agree, and I think a lot of the cult scene is kind of in there as it is, but until Step Mania is something that's over the counter, I don't think it's a real threat.
5230827	5231787	Yeah, that is true, though.
5232008	5237330	It just kind of keeps the cult thing going, and I think that's why Konami hasn't stepped in and done anything about it.
5237610	5241272	But I think if Step Mania were to be something that was sold over the counter, well, then there'd be an issue.
5241332	5243453	But then again, what is in the groove?
5243573	5245594	In the groove is Step Mania, basically.
5245614	5245694	Yeah.
5246740	5267093	so I don't know but until and that's why I say that I don't think Konami is going to do anything about In The Groove unless they try to invade on the home market but of course In The Groove says they have the patents okay whatever fine I'm not going to dispute that but I do think if they try to go to the home route there's going to be a bit of clashing heads there
5267506	5269047	Because that's Konami's baby right now.
5269327	5271169	It's obvious they're putting out press releases on it.
5271209	5272069	You know it's their baby.
5272990	5276732	I mean, they have to be planning to do something to put out a press release.
5276772	5281516	I mean, that would just be silly to be like, we sold a million copies and then drop it.
5282196	5285318	I was just a little disappointed that they didn't announce anything the same day.
5285659	5288601	We all know that DDR Mario is in the making in Japan.
5288921	5292303	So, why not tell us US folks we're going to get it?
5292323	5293284	Because we better be getting it.
5293826	5295690	I'm not liking the DDR Mario.
5295710	5297112	I think that's going to be a little bogus.
5297573	5300138	I think Mario's a little played out.
5300598	5302201	That was sort of in the 90s.
5303003	5305768	Regardless, love or hate Mario, it's more DDR.
5306570	5307270	Yeah, that is true.
5307490	5309111	So, I don't know.
5309651	5311031	Alright, any other comments you got for us?
5311871	5313491	No, that's pretty much about it.
5313912	5314712	Just wanted to call in.
5314752	5315492	It's my first time.
5316212	5317792	Well, thank you for calling in.
5317832	5318873	It's your virgin phone call.
5318913	5319533	We appreciate it.
5319693	5321753	We're glad to initiate you into Orange Lounge.
5322113	5323193	Ha ha ha ha.
5323374	5327034	And Jamie, you may have missed it because you were in the kitchen, but he did say he hopes you feel better.
5327254	5327774	Thank you.
5327874	5328415	I do too.
5329735	5331235	Yeah, we don't want Jamie to die on air.
5331495	5332215	That would not be cool.
5332715	5333436	Yeah, that'd be sad.
5333536	5335076	It'd be interesting for ratings.
5335096	5335216	Yeah.
5336657	5336957	All right.
5337257	5337957	Have a good one, Phoenix.
5337977	5338718	Thanks for calling in, bud.

5341398	5341978	All right.
5342879	5343599	New callers.
5343659	5345299	We like hearing from new people once in a while.
5345799	5346239	Oh, my God.
5346519	5348260	Jamie's head exploded in the bathroom.
5348280	5348820	What was that?
5350800	5352181	I just heard this giant achoo.
5352921	5353201	All right.

5408570	5410211	So it's last week's winner.
5410252	5412073	It's been winning two weeks in a row now.
5412113	5415836	So if it wins tonight, that'll be week number three, halfway to retirement.
5416177	5417037	Let's see if we can do it.
5417097	5417678	Here's a clip.
5417978	5420600	Song number one, Echo Image, Endless Day.
5421241	5423062	We made back in time so we can try
5455259	5455923	Thanks for watching!
5527025	5528089	Thanks for watching!
5571193	5571873	All right, though.
5571933	5575475	Song number one in tonight's cage match, Echo Image, Endless Day.
5575535	5576495	A clip of that there.
5577856	5581517	Alright, let's see if it does it again tonight, but we've got to get the challengers in.
5581637	5583818	First up is DarkSakura's pick.
5583858	5584798	What did you pick for us tonight?
5585639	5588140	Some Eurobeat song.
5588620	5590901	It's been a while since we've had some Eurobeat in the cage match.
5591121	5596483	It's Dream, their version of Night of Fire, but it's a different mix of the sort of rock mix.
5596563	5597623	I don't remember the name of it.
5597903	5599704	Now, Dream originally did Night of Fire.
5600264	5600364	No.
5600444	5601084	No, I thought they did.
5601144	5601504	I'm sorry.
5601824	5604045	No, that was the guy who did Night of Fire.
5604305	5604705	Oh, my bad.
5604766	5605966	And then Dream, I think, redid it.
5606661	5607982	Night of Fire, Dream of Dream Mix
5643158	5645720	Night Dog Fire Night Dog Fire Night Dog Fire
5682299	5683420	Thank you for watching!
5712120	5713341	Thank you for watching!
5743200	5744901	Don't say those sweet, kind words.
5744921	5747901	Because it'll make me feel like I'm going to cry.
5747981	5749762	Even at times like this, stay by my side.
5749862	5751662	I'll give you strength, I'll protect you.
5751702	5755083	Because you'll always be there for me.
5755163	5758444	Because I want to sing with you and be with you.
5774108	5776690	Night of Fire 今あなたと運命を感じてみたいよ Night of Fire 言えないけど抱きしめて欲しい日もあるよ Night of Fire 惹かれていくあなたに
5804662	5807465	Night of Fire Night of Fire Night of Fire Night of Fire
5843140	5846024	Night of Fire Night of Fire
5866187	5871071	Alrighty, that was song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream Mix.
5871412	5874194	Did we here in the studio find that song to be dreamy?
5875215	5875535	Or not?
5876055	5876376	Jamie?
5876776	5877316	I don't care.
5880839	5882140	I guess that's her final word on the matter.
5882701	5883161	Uh, Loki?
5885783	5885944	No.
5886544	5888125	No, no, no, no, no.
5889126	5890067	I was too listening to it.
5890087	5890888	It's Night of Fire.
5890968	5892069	What else do I need to know?
5892549	5893770	You weren't fucking listening to it.
5893970	5894911	You had your headphones on.
5895316	5898199	On one side of my head, just like DJs do.
5899980	5902482	No, I'm sorry, I did listen to it, and you know what?
5902903	5904824	It's still Night of Fire, so it gets like a 7.
5906906	5907647	That's about it, though.
5907927	5909208	No more, because it is Eurobeat.
5909668	5911650	The Eurobeat part of it, you know, really... I...
5918192	5921433	I had a lot of fear going into that, but it actually was pretty neat.
5921993	5924534	I actually thought it would be more Eurobeat than it ended up being.
5925474	5926134	It wasn't too bad.
5926174	5926954	It was kind of catchy.
5927174	5927734	I give it like an 8.
5928715	5929015	Angel.
5930575	5931055	I like it.
5931155	5931755	It's Eurobeat.
5931895	5933596	Eurobeat is fun.
5933936	5933596	8.5.
5935796	5936236	Whatever.
5936256	5936937	It goes enough.
5939257	5941678	Alright, let's get into Loki's pick.
5941798	5942838	Loki, what did you pick tonight?
5945537	5951378	My song is from a group called Osiris, and it's Oneness with the Universe, is what it's called.
5951398	5953819	It's an awesome trans compilation I got a while back.
5956359	5956680	It's good.
5956920	5957200	I don't know.
5959860	5963601	Alright, let's... It's only because you don't want to fucking hear girls again.
5963761	5967022	And goddammit, if this doesn't go in, you can expect girls next week.
5967222	5967502	Got it?
5970268	5970909	We will see.
5971109	5973732	Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.
5973992	5974893	Let's check it out.
5975093	5975754	Song number three.
6000033	6001555	DarkSakura.com
6040064	6041069	Thanks for watching!
6248240	6252644	Let's see what folks thought of Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.
6252784	6256347	Were we oneness with that song, or were we better off without that song?
6256387	6256667	Jamie?
6260010	6264614	I'm drugged, and it was enhancing my drugged state of mind, so it gets a seven.
6265455	6265795	All right.
6266275	6266616	Loki?
6266656	6266916	Loki.
6269252	6269492	Angel Angel
6297938	6307920	It was okay, but you know how those type of songs are, they get kind of repetitive, so I was semi-zoning out at the end of it, so I'll be nice and give it a six.
6310401	6310861	Wow.
6312061	6313922	Angel usually doesn't give anything below a nine.
6313962	6314622	That's pretty harsh.
6314682	6315002	All right.
6315902	6319263	Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight.
6319303	6324444	Song number one, Endless Day with, I'm sorry, Echo Image with Endless Day.
6333283	6338064	Song number two, Dream with Night of Fire, the Dream of Dream mix.
6339005	6342886	And song number three, Osiris, Oneness with the Universe.
6360189	6366592	Alright, place boat now and send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6366752	6367333	You know, he's right.
6367353	6369474	When you listen to a little clip of that song, it sounds pretty cool.
6370094	6370414	Alright.
6372595	6376257	If I were to just play the clips, I probably would have given that song like a 9.
6377138	6377458	Alright.
6380479	6382100	Maybe we'll do that for the cage match one night.
6382140	6383181	It'll just be a clip match.
6384247	6385747	Then we could put like 30 songs in.
6385767	6386348	It would be awesome.
6386808	6387388	All right, we'll see.
6389308	6390809	Remember, private message.
6392549	6394790	Some folks are yelling out their votes in the chat room.
6394890	6395830	Doesn't work that way.
6396010	6396831	Send a private message.
6396851	6398171	If you don't know how to do that, ask.
6399071	6400191	That's all you got to do is ask.
6401572	6402152	Hi, Bugged.
6402372	6405813	I noticed Bugged walked into the room while we were doing the cage match there.
6407233	6409854	Another local Techmaster type person.
6409914	6412895	Not the Techmasa of Orange Lounge Radio, but a Techmasa.
6415871	6416991	Wait, get a mic.
6417031	6417512	We can't hear you.
6418732	6419432	He says get a mic.
6422974	6423114	What?
6424274	6425995	That's the best shirt ever.
6427255	6429376	Bugs is wearing a shirt that says we'll work for bandwidth.
6430296	6430897	And it's true.
6432917	6433278	I have.
6434878	6438039	Unfortunately, you are not the tech master of Orange Lounge Radio.
6438059	6438599	Who do I have to kill?
6439380	6439500	Loki.
6439520	6439800	Loki.
6440467	6446272	and then probably you'd have to kill VXJ's next V too because really he's a big tech guy for the station too.
6446312	6449994	He's more of the web god slash internet penis.
6451676	6452937	Then Loki's the tech massa.
6452997	6455559	You're just A tech massa.
6455959	6458721	Okay, I can live with A. You're from another department.
6461163	6462804	I'll take tech master overlord.
6465546	6466447	That might work, we'll see.
6468354	6470795	You were a tech master before being a tech master was cool.
6471155	6471875	This is very true.
6473956	6477237	Bugged and I went to not only high school together, but junior high school together.
6477637	6478297	Long time ago.
6478317	6480098	I know Bugged a long fucking time.
6480718	6481578	I know Rob's real name.
6481638	6484980	It's Robert.
6485020	6485840	No, that's my last name.
6485880	6486620	Remember Roberts?
6487220	6487500	Get it?
6488381	6488861	Alright, anyway.
6489821	6490301	Moving on.
6490861	6495343	Speaking of the VXJSONXV, our buddy and pal,
6496127	6523302	He actually sent me a link, he wanted me to talk about this on the show tonight at some point I know Loki brought this up briefly, I think a couple shows ago It's this, you know how we were talking about In the Groove and how this is what Konami gets for not putting out a new arcade mix lately Well now, In the Groove is going to have some competition It's a game called Dance Tracks And it's another new game being put out by some folks Loki, have you heard about this one at all?
6525106	6525727	DTX.PulseNetwork.net
6537700	6542061	I will be so kind as to post a link in the chatroom there, if you want.
6542581	6552803	Now, there really isn't a whole lot there besides a lot of blue, but they do have some screenshots from the game, except the screenshots they have are not from the in-game mode.
6552883	6554944	It is the select play mode screen.
6555324	6556444	Woo!
6556544	6557785	It's so brilliant.
6557985	6559065	Woo, I'm so excited.
6560525	6564106	But what they do post in here is they post a partial song list.
6564554	6570079	So you look at the track list here, and I noticed that LMK is on the track list.
6570400	6571501	Now, hmm, that's interesting.
6572181	6574504	And let's see, I noticed this, this I thought was interesting.
6574684	6584953	Ace of Base with Cruel Summer, Bad Religion with Inner Logic, Mindless Self-Indulgence has a couple tracks on there.
6585514	6586295	Jenny Rom!
6586935	6588597	What precisely are you to do to these songs?
6588837	6590239	DM Ashura with Neon Rush DM Ashura with Neon Rush
6606403	6607484	Yeah, so it looks pretty good.
6607524	6609545	At least they've got some good musicians behind it.
6609925	6624234	And if I remember correctly, I do remember hearing this way the hell back in the day, because they were actually going in the Bamai Style music production thread, and they were asking people to help them out with game music and stuff.
6624374	6626295	And so I know these people signed on there.
6627115	6628836	So that's where I remember this from, at least.
6628916	6632278	But hey, at least they've got better people making music.
6633059	6633259	So...
6634145	6637527	I see what they have to show first.
6637567	6641469	Can't really go by much of this menu graphics crap.
6641669	6645291	I don't know.
6648092	6648692	Watch it.
6648772	6649312	Well, I don't know.
6650393	6656436	DJ Slash, he was also the guy that did a lot of stuff back in the day on the DWI Palace.
6657757	6662639	You've got, of course, I can't see the guy's name under his
6663633	6691464	um that was also another sim file maker I know um yeah looks like just a lot of people from the DWI community and stepmania stuff hmm it's kinda neat we'll see we'll see there's really nothing here for me yet we'll see I'll keep my eye on this and we'll see that's about all I can say
6692762	6693722	Don't fuck it up, guys!
6696483	6698144	Alright, uh, let's see.
6699764	6700284	Do they really?
6700384	6701205	I totally missed that.
6703185	6704806	El Mullet says Queen of Love is on there.
6704886	6705826	Oh my god, they're right.
6705886	6707586	Wild Side with Queen of Love is on there.
6708007	6708607	That's awesome.
6708827	6714188	That's like an English version of Bacquois, although it's not really, because it's not actually the lyrics in English, it's just the melody.
6714889	6715569	But that's kind of neat.
6716649	6718790	Okay, so I have a pretty decent track list so far.
6718870	6719550	It's very, uh,
6719983	6724928	DDR Chibi-ish with a little bit of American flavor in there.
6725629	6726109	We'll see.
6728532	6728932	Interesting.
6729733	6730654	More as it develops.
6731222	6732442	Skype line's open again.
6732662	6741525	If you would like to send us a call, you can just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you can call us on the Skype line.
6741925	6748087	I noticed not a lot of people on the Skype line tonight so I'm thinking we might not get a whole lot of calls but it is open if you do want to give us a call.
6748787	6750907	Again, please make sure you have the latest version.
6750927	6755309	I'm going to be tallying up those votes for Cage Match pretty soon.
6755949	6757029	What else is in the news this week?
6757069	6760110	I had another article I wanted to talk about and then I got sidetracked with this
6761107	6762308	and DTXThing.
6766110	6768111	Loki, how about what's going on in the sim scene?
6768151	6768572	Why not?
6768592	6769692	We'll get your sim update done.
6770693	6773855	What's not going on in the sim scene is more like it.
6774575	6777157	Still, DDRUK is still down.
6777257	6778398	Same with DDR Maniacs.
6779038	6780799	It's not looking good for DDR Maniacs.
6780839	6784481	They've been down for months, so say goodbye to them, probably.
6785362	6787363	DDRUK is still down for a while.
6787523	6790045	I'm going to bet that they're not coming back either.
6790943	6796668	Um, and then you've got BamaiStyle, um, nothing really too much going on there.
6797428	6807696	Uh, pretty much the only other thing, like I mentioned last week, there's, um, a bunch of different, like, food mix type stuff that's coming out, actually.
6808757	6816403	A bunch of different ones that I was testing out, um, a while back, like last week or so, that are, um, in the works.
6816423	6817864	Excuse me.
6820286	6820386	Um,
6821840	6824241	Let me see here.
6825301	6831883	Okay, we've got... Let me pull this up real quick here.
6833723	6834764	Well, we are getting a call.
6835184	6836044	Okay, take that call.
6837364	6838605	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6841105	6841545	Hello?
6842906	6844266	Hello, you are on Orange Sounds Radio.
6847047	6847467	Can you hear us?
6847607	6848347	Ah, there we go.
6848427	6848987	There you go.
6849167	6850508	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
6850708	6851108	Who is this?
6851735	6852495	This is Raichan.
6852635	6853916	Hi Raichan, how are you?
6854436	6856177	It's been a while since I've called you guys.
6856257	6858278	I thought I'd just call and say hi.
6858298	6859739	It has been a little while.
6859839	6860879	Hello to you, my friend.
6863140	6867522	Yes, Joyce is sitting over here working on my Katamari hat again.
6868122	6869463	She's doing the last little bit.
6869783	6871204	Hello, Joyce, as well.
6871464	6872104	Hope you're doing well.
6872777	6875538	Yeah, he says hello, Joyce, saying he hopes you're doing well.
6875639	6876099	She waves.
6877079	6877519	All right.
6878220	6879400	I've got the headphones on.
6879961	6881742	Now, you guys are making hats together?
6882522	6887084	Yeah, well, she hasn't taught me how to crochet yet, which is the next project.
6887645	6889065	She's teaching me how to do it.
6889165	6893367	She's working on a Katamari hat for me, and then she's going to do one for Jason, too.
6894108	6895929	What exactly is a Katamari hat?
6897109	6900651	There was a girl that sold a hat on eBay recently for $130 that
6902887	6905569	was a crocheted hat that was like a Katamari ball.
6906370	6910333	It had the little bumps on it like the Katamari have.
6911594	6912415	And the little hearts.
6912575	6915137	I noticed on the little hat it had little hearts in the bumps.
6915457	6916038	So cute.
6916538	6917239	Virgo one.
6917299	6922083	Mine's the one with all the hearts and the pink and all that sort of stuff.
6922824	6928128	I don't have a really good one in my journal, but I did post one in Damacy Loving.
6929372	6934014	So if you want to see a picture of this, go to LiveJournal and look up Dimash 11, and there's a picture of it.
6934735	6939557	Here, let me see if I can find that one real quick, and I'll post a link in the chat room.
6939697	6940058	Awesome.
6940778	6944240	Chat room again over at www.orangenautoradio.com, click on chat.
6944780	6950163	So you're going to be learning how to crochet, and you'll be doing a hat as well for yourself?
6950983	6952424	No, the one being made now is for you.
6953184	6954465	The one being made now is for me.
6954545	6956086	And then you're going to make one for Jason.
6956949	6958750	Well, she's actually got one started for Jason.
6958870	6959330	Oh, okay.
6959350	6961691	But you're going to learn how to crochet because it's fun.
6963172	6963472	Yeah.
6963952	6964692	Right on, right on.
6965733	6967453	Well, how about that DDR?
6967493	6968714	Any DDR news you want to share?
6970294	6973075	Well, I started talking to Middyhead last night.
6973276	6973696	Oh, yeah?
6974316	6984220	He was saying something because I started a step file for House of Joy and recently just got things set up for Maxim.
6985077	6989059	and I posted in his forum about it and he sounds really interested.
6989140	6993882	He might actually do some remixes specifically for Step Mania.
6994263	6995683	Wow, that's kind of neat.
6996084	6996344	Yeah.
6996364	6997224	That guy is so cool.
6997264	6998185	I'm excited about that.
6998717	7001999	I was talking to him about maybe we can just take and put him up in the VIP area for his site, but
7028550	7031552	He was like, no, I'd be pretty cool with you just sharing them around.
7031973	7032853	Wow, very cool.
7033194	7035035	Where can folks download this?
7035255	7036276	Do you have it up on the web somewhere?
7036336	7041580	No, actually I don't because I recently recut the MP3 for it.
7042781	7046644	And then I need to give it back to Jason because he was working on the heavy steps for it.
7047004	7050767	Maybe once you guys are done, maybe we can work something out on originalsradio.com.
7050787	7052188	Maybe we can help you out.
7052548	7053549	That'd be cool.
7053849	7054810	All right, right on.
7054890	7055170	Cool.
7056611	7057852	So anything else you want to share?
7059344	7059804	Not really.
7060224	7065685	I got Stepmania set up for hooking it up to my TV downstairs in the basement.
7066465	7067166	Ah, that's fun.
7067346	7070026	But that's because I've got Joyce.
7071286	7073167	I've got Joyce started playing DDR.
7073827	7077508	She's only really been playing for about a month, seriously.
7078008	7079168	And how's she doing after a month?
7080048	7081968	She's actually just starting to get into heavy.
7082008	7084229	She can do some six foot, some seven.
7084689	7084889	Hmm.
7085509	7086309	Not bad for a month.
7086349	7089010	God, after a month, I think I was graduating to threes.
7089371	7090051	So very nice stuff.
7090091	7092652	You know, she's got those Asian genes in her.
7095173	7098454	She's half Korean, so she's got it working for her.
7098634	7099215	Very cool.
7099535	7099775	Good job.
7099915	7101356	Hey, Jamie just got back in the room.
7101396	7102436	I've got to share this with Jamie.
7102676	7109379	Did you know that Raichan and her friend Joyce, they're making Katamari hats from Katamari Damacy?
7109399	7110840	Yeah, you read the journal, so you probably know.
7110860	7111740	But isn't that so cool?
7114129	7116770	Yeah, right now, Joyce is the only one making them.
7117570	7117810	Okay.
7118870	7121531	But you're moral support, and that counts for something.
7122052	7122292	Yes.
7122512	7123312	Alright, very cool.
7123632	7128194	Alright, Raichan, I'm going to say goodbye, but thanks so much for calling in, and we hope to hear from you again sometime.
7128814	7128974	Yep.
7129254	7130015	Alright, have a good one, buddy.
7130555	7131035	Alright, goodbye.
7131075	7131415	Bye.
7132896	7133176	Okay.
7133436	7135857	Alright, Loki is going to finish his sim file thought.
7136137	7139058	As I was mentioning before, there's a whole bunch of stuff...
7139639	7143430	for those people out there that were looking for life after FoonMix.
7144952	7151375	Starting off, there's a thread that was in Bimani Style on their DDR simulation stuff.
7151896	7157759	And it's the Japanese DDR fan mix watch thread.
7158179	7161401	And basically they have a few listed on here that you can go check out.
7161821	7168304	Starting with DDR XX Mix, which is... They said they're currently testing it this week.
7168624	7172867	And the song list so far... It's a lot of... Like...
7173871	7174693	BMS stuff.
7174773	7177799	It's kind of... I don't know how to really describe it.
7178601	7181887	But they've got... Let's see here.
7182729	7183811	They kind of reverted back.
7183891	7184212	It was
7187597	7196419	Okay, anyways, so I played it a little earlier this week, it's pretty decent, they've got some decent files for that, with videos in the background, that kind of thing.
7196439	7207081	Then we have DDR D3 Mix, which is, they only have really one song done on it so far, this song called J219 by Cranky, which is interesting.
7207101	7212622	DDR E-Mix, which is all anime J-pop, if you like that kind of stuff.
7213497	7220782	Then we have Strawberry Steps, which is kind of more like an event, not really a mix, but interesting stuff anyways.
7222731	7228292	There was another one I found too, something about like Pop Candy or something mixed, but I don't have the link for that.
7228752	7236933	Then there's a new theme also that's on the same thread, Step Mania Siberia style, which is basically it looks just like Techno Fiend.
7236993	7239194	It's pretty cool to check it out.
7239294	7244675	So, yeah, that was pretty much what was going on in the Sim scene.
7244715	7245415	Not really much.
7245755	7251776	Then, of course, I mentioned last week that one bondage chick thing that was retarded, but...
7253277	7254358	Yeah, that's everything.
7255979	7257460	That was someone with too much free time.
7259121	7259441	Agreed.
7259721	7260602	And he wasn't getting laid.
7262063	7264484	Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?
7266906	7271229	Jamie says... Alright, let's find out who won tonight's cage match.
7271609	7275952	Ladies and gentlemen, we have a new champion in the cage match this week, and it is...
7280390	7281891	I don't fucking believe it.
7282131	7285854	Night of Fire by a landslide even.
7286474	7287395	By a landslide.
7287435	7290738	The other two songs combined did not take that one out.
7291278	7291778	Wow.
7292058	7294420	I'm surprised because I just sort of threw it in.
7295141	7296061	Well, there you have it.
7296101	7296742	It's in there now.
7296822	7301886	The winner, Dream, Night of Fire.
7303707	7305528	I need to be sick more often.
7306249	7309191	Tune in next week to see if Loki makes good on his promise.
7310183	7313166	and maybe I'm going to make a mean pick next week too.
7313206	7313666	We'll see.
7314487	7314867	All right.
7318170	7319711	Let's go to a break, boys and girls.
7319811	7328198	When we come back from this break, I think it's high time we got into the FUs of the week because damn it, we're getting angsty.
7330720	7336045	In this break, I'm doing fourth mix songs because I'm playing Hypnotic Crisis.
7337208	7339629	and if you were here with me, the B4 Zah Mix because those songs are cool.
7339689	7341170	Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God, oh my God.
7341210	7341410	What?
7341650	7342791	We need Saints Go Marching.
7343871	7344711	Yes, we do.
7345011	7347413	We're going to do Saints Go Marching and we'll do Ninja Bro.
7347673	7348173	Hell with it.
7348233	7349694	It's a four song break, damn you.
7350394	7351434	We'll be back after this.
7352015	7353035	Get your fourth mix on.
7353235	7354656	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
7407539	7408141	Thanks for watching!
7445441	7446108	Thank you for watching!
7641520	7642664	Thanks for watching!
7672938	7676449	Feel the heat, the vibration, on the streets, new situation, got the crazy car
7714130	7720313	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
7722795	7724135	Orange Lounge Radio.
7729218	7731039	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7731079	7731739	Did you miss us?
7733040	7733520	I hope so.
7734261	7735542	Sounds like their aim's improving.
7735622	7736082	Yeah, I know.
7736542	7737563	Hopefully your aim is improving.
7737743	7738843	Are your allergies improving yet?
7739444	7740244	When I lay down.
7740784	7741945	Okay, well I hope you feel better.
7742461	7747904	It's okay, I'm just laying... I'm actually... This chair is so huge that I can lay across it.
7749846	7750446	I love that chair.
7750466	7751407	It's pretty comfortable.
7751907	7753008	I want to make love to that chair.
7753568	7754348	Just kidding, I don't.
7754448	7754769	Please don't.
7754789	7755009	I won't.
7755029	7755689	I have to sit here.
7755729	7756870	Not while you're laying in it, anyway.
7758731	7760252	So I'm pissed off about something.
7762733	7763374	I know, nobody cares.
7764675	7767016	Where the fuck is Ultramix 2 Song Pack 8?
7767116	7767917	What the fuck?
7767937	7768537	What the fuck?
7770003	7772285	It was announced like forever ago.
7773686	7779029	Now, I know, from what I understand, Konami submitted it and it's Microsoft's fault.
7779089	7780630	They're sitting on it or whatever.
7781231	7782111	God damn it!
7782452	7783332	Release it already.
7783412	7786214	Listen to these songs that are going to be in Ultramix 2 song pack number 8.
7786715	7787855	Cosmic Cowgirl.
7788456	7789276	Love that song.
7789497	7791418	Do I have clips of some of these songs?
7792341	7792942	I hope I do.
7793903	7796266	Let me see if I got a little clip of Cowgirl, or Cosmic Cowgirl.
7796567	7797628	No, we all know Cowgirl.
7798649	7802655	I'm thinking Cosmic Cowgirl.
7803756	7806339	This is like all the way from Guitar Freak's, like, what, third mix?
7806680	7809483	Cosmic Cowgirl was like my favorite song to play on Drumania.
7809523	7809804	Here it is.
7821601	7822402	That song rocks.
7823142	7824003	I want that damn song.
7826425	7829688	And then this one I can't even pronounce, but it's a fun song to play.
7830189	7831990	Balalakia, Carried with the Wind.
7832671	7833231	Balalakia.
7834873	7836334	By Julianne Frost in Song Pack 8.
7836855	7838836	More deep version 2.1.
7838916	7839977	Well, we already have that one.
7839997	7841519	I'm not so concerned with that one.
7842019	7844922	In My Eyes, the Neuromix by Neuropa.
7845808	7846528	That is so cool.
7846569	7848750	Naropa did like one of the coolest songs in Ultramix 2.
7848790	7850971	They did Standing Still in Time and they sound like Erasure.
7851271	7852792	I can't wait to see what they do to In My Eyes.
7852852	7853433	It's going to rock.
7853993	7855834	And then Kind Lady, The Interlude.
7857255	7858836	Notice about this song pack.
7859796	7865640	What a lot of people were bitching about with the Konami song packs is that they were recycling a lot of old garbage.
7866601	7869362	Only one old song in this pack.
7869722	7872104	And really, it's not even that old.
7872722	7876424	It's only shown up in, like, what, two other releases?
7876524	7877565	One in Japan, one in the US?
7878185	7878846	On PS2?
7879406	7881047	So, more Deep Version 2.1.
7881107	7882028	Okay, you've seen it before.
7882648	7884189	But the other four are all new!
7885210	7885770	What a deal!
7886030	7886670	Five bucks!
7886851	7888171	Microsoft, get up off your ass.
7888211	7888952	Put this on the site.
7889052	7889692	I want to download it.
7890793	7891313	It's new!
7892954	7893314	Damn it!
7895576	7896576	What's wrong with you people?
7898117	7899078	I'm just really upset about this.
7901567	7903628	Maybe I have a little clip of the Kind Lady interlude, too.
7903668	7904968	I was kind of hoping I would have one of those.
7906229	7906689	I don't know, though.
7907329	7916613	Maybe, uh... No, I only have the... I have the Japanese VRare at some point, but I think I moved it into a deep, dark directory I'm not going to find anytime soon.
7919094	7920835	Um... Yeah.
7921135	7922015	Oh, well, maybe another time.
7923056	7923416	It's all right.
7924996	7928898	I guess it's time for us to get into the FUs of the week.
7928918	7929058	Okay.
7932318	7932838	Sound good?
7933839	7934440	We don't have to.
7934520	7936261	I mean, we could just, you know, end the show.
7937762	7938282	Promise.
7939043	7942445	Alright, you guys can send your FUs of the week over to Sky in the chat room.
7942905	7943686	Let's start it off.
7943746	7945007	Here we go, FUs of the week.
7947289	7948429	Oh, I'm sorry.
7948690	7950771	Jamie, why do we have to do the FUs every week?
7955734	7956795	Very good, now use your mouth.
7958436	7959157	Oh, this is bad.
7959197	7960538	Here is justice.
7960558	7961298	Here is justice.
7968072	7969693	Fuck you to my allergies.
7970153	7970893	I hate them.
7971794	7973775	And my cat for sleeping on my head.
7975576	7976656	I hate my allergies.
7976736	7978197	I'm on all kinds of drugs right now.
7978237	7980598	They're not doing shit to make me feel better.
7981939	7985901	Um... Also, F you to sneezing messily in my car.
7987221	7989442	And then to stupid drivers.
7990483	7992404	And then to my Photoshop teacher.
7992424	7994725	Because Photoshop sucks, but he's an elitist.
7996265	7996365	Um...
7997966	8002269	F you to the seven goblins that followed my ass through the tomb in Final Fantasy XI.
8002349	8007533	I hope that some paladin came by and owned all your asses.
8008434	8009374	Because you suck.
8012957	8015258	F you to how slow leveling in that game is.
8016359	8021663	But it is a very blessed thing that there's not so much of the Ragnarok-style newbie talk.
8022263	8024004	Which really sucks a whole bunch of ass.
8025786	8025886	Um...
8028266	8032750	FU to not having any real concentration.
8033310	8037894	Other situations that I can't really do anything about.
8040456	8045940	FU to GameStop just for a situation involving my fiancé.
8050123	8052325	And that's really it.
8054506	8057869	Alright, then let's go over to our buddy Loki with his FUs of the week.
8061874	8063135	Fucking A, okay?
8063235	8068821	You know, first off, fucking A-Bit for, um, creating... I think it was A-Bit, I don't even remember.
8068961	8069522	No, A.S.
8070262	8070603	Rock.
8071243	8076188	For creating a stupid motherboard with, you know, five different places to put RAM.
8076969	8081173	And for confusing me for hours because I put the RAM in the wrong spot.
8082374	8082595	Dope.
8084056	8084557	Anyway.
8085217	8085798	And, um...
8086779	8093901	Also, basically just fucking using my crazy sleep schedule because I'm going to be so tired tomorrow.
8094541	8099722	Not that I really care because it'll be fine because everyone will be getting mad at Erica because I was leaving for my work.
8100542	8106384	And fucking using my goddamn case because I had to get another...
8107079	8107639	No, they don't.
8107659	8107999	They get worse.
8108039	8108079	Um...
8133918	8140503	I'd like to give an F you to the government for getting one of my high school friends killed in Iraq.
8140743	8141443	That kind of sucks.
8141904	8142184	Yes.
8143004	8144245	So, F you to the government.
8145246	8146767	F you to Bush while I'm at it, because I don't like him.
8146807	8147147	I never did.
8148488	8152031	And F you to the fact that I have to get up and go to work early tomorrow.
8152051	8152471	That sucks.
8152531	8153071	I don't like that.
8154452	8157875	F you to me being lazy.
8158115	8160016	I'm not getting anything accomplished, but that's my own damn fault.
8160036	8160756	So, F you to myself.
8161817	8161977	And...
8163636	8164356	F you to Angst!
8165477	8166297	I've had a lot of it lately.
8167537	8169058	But I hide it really good on this show.
8170118	8172539	But secretly I'm plotting to kill each and every one of you.
8173079	8173479	Just kidding.
8173679	8173979	Love ya.
8174619	8175280	Thanks for the warning.
8175380	8175760	You're welcome.
8176300	8178521	Let's see what the other folks in the studio have to say.
8178601	8179381	Starting with Bugged.
8180281	8181502	Yes, double F you to the government.
8181522	8182882	He was a very good high school buddy.
8183782	8188144	And I've heard from various people that I haven't heard it from in ten years.
8188304	8190304	Really?
8191685	8192145	Oh, shit.
8193359	8198763	Yeah, it was a very strange phone call today, because this person was very close to the friend who died.
8200044	8204007	It was strange.
8204027	8207350	FU to diesel prices, as always.
8209552	8211993	Not FU to running diesel.
8213775	8216117	We still get way good miles to the gallon, so shut up.
8216317	8217398	Yeah, I do.
8217478	8217958	I get 40.
8218338	8220280	And FU to Johnny Carson dying.
8220880	8221521	Oh, that sucked, too.
8222711	8225132	We did a memorial last week, but that still sucks.
8226792	8227452	I wasn't running.
8228172	8228592	That's alright.
8229153	8231933	And, uh, pretty good week.
8232213	8234054	I need to bring the hard drive to my iMac.
8235414	8242915	I saved a laptop by pulling the hard drive out, moving files over for a UC Davis College student.
8242935	8243956	Putting them on my elder iMac.
8244016	8244476	I've had words.
8244496	8247476	She was happy she had a computer that worked.
8247496	8248837	She didn't want to talk about it.
8252998	8263282	FU to people who have a problem with me and won't come to me and come to my friends instead, that's all I have to say
8280137	8282442	about the FUs of the Week segment here on this program.
8282483	8284126	Let me get my reminder music up.
8284206	8286251	If I could do this here.
8292455	8301799	Boys and girls, we here at Orange Lounge Radio do the FUs of the week as a service to you and ourselves because we certainly get a load off of our chest.
8301859	8308782	Now, luckily, we're a small program and nobody listens to us, so pretty much anybody who submits their FUs will get it right on the air.
8309242	8311903	One day, we will be bigger than God and...
8312927	8315168	We're not going to read your FUs anymore because we won't have the time.
8315408	8317749	We'll have a little dark corner of the website where you can post them.
8318069	8320030	But for now, we read your FUs on the air.
8320310	8322291	However, there are some exceptions to this rule.
8322731	8325612	We do not read FUs of a personal nature.
8325972	8330354	In other words, if you're going to rant about somebody else, we're not going to read that FU on the air.
8330414	8331814	Now, of course, there's exceptions to every rule.
8332174	8336916	If you're going to rant about your teacher, we'll read that FU because, you know what, your teacher doesn't like you either.
8337256	8338477	So, fine, we'll read that FU.
8339611	8340532	FUs to your parents.
8340832	8343274	Yeah, everybody has FUs about their parents once in a while.
8343534	8345656	You know, you love your parents, but some days you want to kill them.
8346016	8346437	Guess what?
8346477	8347878	They feel the same way about you.
8348858	8352401	They love you most days, but some days they want to kill you and wish you'd never been born.
8353082	8356204	So we will allow the FUs to teachers and parents and bosses.
8356504	8357405	We all hate our boss.
8357545	8358646	Actually, I love my boss.
8358826	8360468	I love my boss.
8360708	8361468	I love people I work with.
8361709	8363670	But I know a lot of you work in retail, so you don't.
8364010	8364591	So that's fine.
8364891	8365912	You can give an FU to your boss.
8367293	8368834	Those types of FUs are fine.
8369134	8380080	However, if you're going to give an FU to like an ex-boyfriend, or an ex-girlfriend, or an ex-best friend, or an ex-wife, well, some exceptions.
8380701	8383763	I still let some exceptions even with that.
8383843	8389186	But, for the most part, if you want to give an FU about those types of things, let me give you a phone number.
8389206	8389986	1-800-96-JERRY Okay?
8394409	8396250	That is where you can go to handle your problems.
8396390	8399092	Please, do not send them care of Orange Lounge Radio.
8399352	8401113	We don't want to get caught in the middle of your bullshit.
8401453	8401753	Thank you.
8403874	8405495	And now, the chatroom FUs of the week.
8409618	8410238	Let's see.
8410818	8413760	VXJasonXV says, FU to Tifa.
8414240	8414581	That's all.
8415741	8417642	Rai Chan says, oh, Joyce first.
8417662	8418543	She's sending Joyce's.
8419606	8426911	Joy says, F you to sick, demented fruitcakes that feel they can abuse animals and then don't even bother taking them to a shelter and leave them to fend for themselves.
8427111	8427671	Yeah.
8428932	8432514	Rychan says, F you to all the people at Walmart on Sunday afternoons.
8432614	8433274	Come on, people.
8433615	8438978	There has to be something better for you to do than stand in the middle of the aisle while your children run around like they're in a playground.
8440646	8450310	BRP Ohio Bomani, the Big Red Pimp, says F you to Food Network for showing stupid American football party specials that make him wait for Iron Chef America to come on again.
8450390	8451391	Flay vs. Ming.
8454572	8454912	All right.
8456453	8462436	Illusion says F you to the Super Blue Sphere levels in Sonic 3 and Knuckles for being so damn hard to beat.
8463050	8470393	and FU to my cousin, though more of an in-your-face FU because we played Texas Hold'em last night and I started with 18 pennies and ended up with 80.
8471054	8472134	Flush that, you bitch!
8474275	8483119	Dark Knight says FU to freeze my ass off because of this weather and FU to school for screwing up my financial aid because without the aid I can't attend college for the summer now.
8485487	8513395	Legend of Zaku says F you to currently being unemployed F you to Sony for releasing the piss poor slim PS2 and F you to the ongoing worldwide shortage of them and F you to selling my Chinese textbook last semester not knowing I was going to need it for the second part of the class this semester thus having to buy a new one and not being prepared for a murder of a quiz tomorrow SSJ100 Matt says F you to Emo Boy from Thursday Night Show for sassing me about sports games oh that was lanky style
8514491	8517812	FU to... Oh, that is a personal FU.
8518273	8518533	Sorry.
8519473	8521674	Dork says FU to girls.
8521914	8522334	Cry.
8522574	8522894	Me.
8523135	8523515	Bye.
8528637	8529017	Lovely.
8529177	8531618	Thank you guys for sharing your FUs with us.
8533158	8534739	We feel your angst.
8535879	8536800	Oh, Jamie has another one.
8537340	8538040	Let me get your song.
8538400	8539561	No, you don't need to.
8539661	8540501	Just to myself.
8540701	8540961	Okay.
8542282	8542482	Why?
8542502	8542562	Why?
8544969	8545409	Why?
8545990	8546911	But we love you, Jamie.
8556938	8557479	When in doubt.
8557879	8558219	All right.
8558560	8559901	When in doubt, haunt people.
8561622	8562143	Hear, hear.
8564364	8565005	Let's see.
8565125	8565765	He's a stalker.
8567126	8568808	I think you have a couple in our chat room.
8568848	8571230	I think Phoenix, well, Phoenix said he was a fanboy.
8571250	8571630	He's a stalker.
8572515	8574195	I think he's more of a fanboy than a stalker.
8574556	8575536	You want a stalker?
8576196	8579397	I do, just because it would be fun and interesting.
8579717	8583738	And then I could hunt them down and kill them as revenge.
8584438	8585438	And then get on the news.
8589219	8593160	Alright, if you want to stalk Jamie, send those emails to jamie at orangeloungeradio.com
8594696	8599421	And did you know it'll also work for Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com or Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com?
8599701	8600942	Yeah, I agree.
8601082	8606608	If anyone puts a personal F you in, again, we stick a Nevada-ton on them.
8610071	8611533	She can go after them with a box cutter.
8612013	8612214	Hmm.
8615003	8618185	Hey, did you know that the DanceMania folks updated their website?
8618225	8622127	DanceMania, you know, being the series that DDR got a lot of its music from in Japan.
8622547	8624208	They got a new album coming out soon.
8624648	8626429	It's Disco Viking.
8628671	8629611	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
8629651	8631712	No, it's a lot of really interesting old songs.
8632052	8633773	Listen to some of these songs that are on the CD.

8666307	8666907	Love that song.
8667288	8669129	Telephone Operator by Pete Shelley.
8669149	8673051	I think that song's been in just about every other Dance Mania CD.
8673551	8675132	Oh, and this is so cool.
8675772	8677433	Madness within the city.
8678434	8679354	It's not our house.
8679454	8680054	It's in the city.
8682135	8683116	Madness had another song.
8683256	8683716	I know.
8686458	8688999	The Steve Miller Band, Abracadabra.
8689840	8691961	Abracadabra.
8694102	8694382	All right.
8694969	8697471	We got to go to a break because Jamie's foaming at the mouth.
8697511	8698832	She wants to get into the chat room.
8699732	8704316	She's going to regulate, so we have to log out on the main screen so we can get her in.
8704896	8708178	She wants to be cyber-stalked by those of you guys, so we got to make it work.
8708198	8710420	Yes, apparently we're not doing a good enough job for her in person.
8711881	8716404	All right, we're going to play some Euromix songs in this break because I want to hear Video Kill the Radio Star.
8717064	8719926	So we're going to do some varying Euromix tracks.
8722368	8723629	And then we'll be back.
8725675	8728942	Oh, and Jamie wants to hear Kids in America, so I guess we can pull that song in there too.
8731647	8734513	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

9310845	9312726	We love our listeners that help us out with those things.
9314147	9314827	It's all about you guys.
9315808	9322290	Comments to the show can always be sent to rob at orangelaunchradio.com or jamie or loki at orangelaunchradio.com Any of them.
9324171	9325832	Alright, let's see.
9329217	9331038	We're going to go into Ask Orange Lounge.
9331098	9335261	Hey, Dark Knight, send me a private message with more information on what you're saying in chatroom.
9335281	9336401	I'm too lazy to type right now.
9336942	9337502	This is great.
9337802	9340864	I'm just going to talk to the chatroom tonight.
9343265	9343846	Alright, forget it.
9346447	9351330	But Dark Knight, send me a private message with a link to more information and I will do so.
9354403	9356305	Alright, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge.
9356325	9359447	This is your opportunity to ask us some stuff.
9367054	9369957	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9370497	9373720	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9374421	9377463	Will we find the cure to Jamie's allergies?
9377944	9381227	Or will we find a cure for Matt's big angst?
9385977	9388458	There's no cure, no cure The easy answer I have to that is yes
9407349	9408990	We already have a podcast-only segment.
9432395	9437878	Remember, the cage match didn't show up until episode 20, and some of the segments, you know, it didn't show up until later on.
9438538	9439419	And now we whore them out.
9439459	9441400	I mean, if we didn't have these segments, we wouldn't have a show.
9441880	9443301	The podcast will do the same thing.
9444341	9453506	The other cool thing about the podcast is that it's very flexible, is that we could, if we wanted to, if we were on the road somewhere...
9454364	9458066	Loki's trying to build us an on-the-road computer that's going to be inside an Xbox.
9458127	9460568	In fact, if you look on cam, you can kind of see Loki's head.
9460888	9461869	That's what he's working on right now.
9461889	9463150	He's working on the Xbox PC.
9463610	9470535	We have a plan that this year from E3, we're going to be giving you updates via the podcast every day on what we've seen at E3.
9472305	9481110	Honestly, if you were to watch this coverage on television, on one of the tech stations on TV, you'd be waiting a couple weeks to a month to be seeing these sorts of updates.
9481710	9485592	If you were to be reading about it in a magazine, you'd be waiting like six to eight weeks to see this stuff.
9485932	9488834	Even other websites take a couple days sometimes.
9489254	9495217	We will have live audio from E3 the same damn day.
9495857	9496518	It's going to rock.
9497138	9499239	That's the kind of cool stuff the podcast is going to present.
9499299	9500400	That's what we're planning to do.
9500900	9501060	So...
9502631	9503472	All those sorts of things.
9503552	9504273	So thank you very much.
9504513	9505193	Hugs and kisses.
9506815	9507075	Alright.
9508516	9510658	Let's get to some more questions here.
9511839	9514161	What else do you guys think could be done with the podcast?
9514202	9517625	Anything you guys want to add to that?
9520287	9523830	We could even do other podcasts for some of our spin-off shows.
9525892	9527534	Yeah, we do have that ability, honestly.
9528074	9529035	So we shall see.
9531593	9531973	All right.
9537256	9537957	Dead air, dead air.
9537977	9542139	Sorry, I'm posting a link in our chat room right now on how folks can help.
9542259	9544100	I can make the grudge sound again.
9544820	9545181	Do that.
9548302	9548683	Thank you.
9549323	9550944	I don't know if you took apart a laptop battery.
9550964	9551464	That's fun.
9552285	9552905	What?
9553265	9555246	I said I just took apart a laptop battery.
9555286	9555887	That's fun.
9556147	9556387	Fun.
9556447	9557027	What's inside?
9557668	9558128	Batteries.
9559906	9561247	Scary stuff that could hurt me.
9563007	9564668	Legend of Zaku has a question.
9564788	9569791	What licensed songs would you like to see on an American 2DX mix if it happens?
9572072	9574313	Any requests for an... Shaft.
9575413	9576494	The theme from Shaft.
9576874	9578394	Jamie says Temple of Butt.
9578715	9579995	She's yelling from the laundry room.
9580295	9581236	Angel, anything you want to see?
9584697	9585178	I don't know.
9585198	9585798	All of a sudden I...
9586673	9590736	I thought of the BT song from Extreme.
9590876	9592558	I don't know why, I just kind of thought of it.
9592638	9593678	I don't know.
9593718	9594419	Simply Being Loved.
9595019	9597241	Yeah, I was going to say that, but I don't know.
9598782	9601444	Either that or just something different.
9601504	9601825	I don't know.
9602265	9604146	Dude, Skull could be actually kind of fun to play.
9604307	9605307	Oh my god, yes.
9606969	9607629	Any echo image.
9608750	9612113	Just mix, just honestly, team up with a different drum.
9612553	9613774	Let Konami Hawaii do it.
9615175	9616436	And team up with a different drum.
9617148	9618189	because that would be so hot.
9619870	9622172	So that and what other songs would be good?
9623773	9627596	Actually, a lot of the crossovers they've had in DDR might be fun, like Dirty Vegas would be kind of cute.
9629037	9629858	What else would be fun?
9630338	9632280	I'm trying to think of songs that haven't really been in DDR yet.
9633260	9634041	Or 2DX.
9634501	9635202	Actually, you know what?
9635262	9640826	Even though this song's already been in 2DX and it's a really horrid song, I really want to see it in 2DX USA.
9641327	9641907	Deadline.
9642468	9643128	I love Deadline.
9644129	9644349	Love it.
9646551	9646691	Um...
9648755	9654897	Honestly, just go to like Robbins Entertainment and just put anything from those dance compilations.
9655217	9657778	Just give us some Lasco, some Ian Vandal.
9658379	9658859	I don't care.
9659679	9660639	All that stuff would be cool.
9661140	9663300	I want that Come Into My Dream song by Froggy.
9663641	9665041	Come into my dream.
9665061	9666482	Because that has a really cool beat to it.
9666682	9668602	Ooh, definitely do that.
9671904	9673964	Alright, let's see.
9674645	9675685	Illusion has a question.
9677384	9683629	Illusion wants to know, okay, he's done a lot of soul searching here, and he's wanted to ask this question for the longest time.
9684189	9689033	Weeks have gone by, sleepless nights, because I couldn't ask this question, he says.
9689573	9690694	Here is his question.
9691634	9694076	Is Jem truly outrageous?
9695797	9697218	Truly, truly outrageous.
9698199	9699160	Jem is adventure.
9699560	9700381	Jem is excitement.
9701321	9702342	Jem is lame.
9702762	9703663	Jem is not lame!
9704063	9706205	She is not, but the dolls have really huge heads.
9707830	9709832	But the misfits, their songs are better.
9710353	9711073	And they're going to get her.
9711694	9716719	It was all about later in the series when Jetta showed up and played that black saxophone.
9716799	9718421	I was like, my hero forever.
9723226	9723686	You know what?
9724147	9730093	Since we got some extra time here, since we haven't gotten a whole lot of questions, I have to play at least a little clip of this because this is so cool.
9730876	9732397	You guys know Freeze Pop, right?
9732857	9739719	They're the band that did Super Sprode and Science Genius Girl.
9740279	9742180	You know they've got like two full albums, right?
9743320	9743580	What?
9746101	9746961	Yeah, Shark Attack.
9747101	9748342	They've got other songs.
9748762	9751002	But one of the songs they do is so cool.
9751022	9751763	You've got to hear this.
9752423	9753983	I've got to find the directory it's in, though.
9754804	9756504	My computer's a big fat mess right now.
9757004	9758665	It is actually a cover...
9759838	9760478	You're not going to believe this.
9760779	9762700	It's a cover of the Gem theme song.
9763760	9764561	That is awesome.
9764681	9765041	Play it.
9765201	9766462	I'm going to play a little clip of it.
9766482	9767983	Okay, I'm only going to play like the first verse.
9768223	9768503	Here it is.
9784918	9794301	Jem, Jem is excitement, Jem, Jem is adventure, Jem, Jem is truly outrageous, truly, truly, truly outrageous, Jem, Jem is my name, no one else is the same,
9826226	9829009	Come on, they're the misfits, they're gonna get her.
9829789	9830430	Isn't that cool?
9831431	9833653	Yeah, I have to tell a little story about Freeze Pop.
9833773	9834874	Alright, tell a story about Freeze Pop.
9835074	9847025	Freeze Pop is from Boston, I have a bunch of friends in Boston, and they were, my friends were at a club, and this guy was going off about how he hates, hates Freeze Pop because they sound so fake.
9847779	9851280	Meanwhile, the lead singer of Freeze Pop was standing behind him just fuming.
9853461	9853741	Yeah.
9854701	9856222	And apparently she could really kick ass.
9857162	9857542	Did she?
9857942	9858702	I don't believe so.
9858802	9860223	Oh, Freeze Pop is so awesome.
9860403	9866545	It was pointed out that the lead singer that he really hates the sound of was standing right behind him, and I guess he left.
9867445	9868625	Much to his own behest.
9869406	9871346	Oh my god, we need to get Freeze Pop on this show.
9873807	9876008	I doubt that's even possible, but I would try.
9876028	9876988	They tend to stick around Boston.
9877859	9878959	No, they don't have to be here.
9879260	9880320	We do have the phone thing.
9880740	9881300	You can Skype them.
9881540	9882241	Yeah, see?
9882701	9883901	We got MidiHead on this show.
9884101	9884441	Damn it.
9884701	9885502	Anything's possible.
9886782	9890023	I'll see what my contacts can do.
9890263	9890483	Ooh!
9890544	9894465	Have your people talk to their people, and then have their people contact my people, and we'll have a people party.
9895265	9896005	Yay, people party.
9896466	9897386	Or do you get the Android before?
9898866	9899387	All the time.
9899707	9900287	Non-stop.
9901027	9903588	DarkSakura, I know you're a big Gem fan and a FreezePop fan.
9903608	9904228	What did you think of that?
9905189	9906049	That was pretty neat.
9906693	9907653	I love the Misfits part.
9907674	9908514	That's like the best part of this all.
9908714	9909654	We are the Misfits.
9909694	9910735	Our songs are better.
9911475	9912096	Have you heard this?
9912256	9913456	I've got a... Okay, you know what?
9914577	9914977	I don't care.
9915017	9917258	I'm going to play another little clip of a Freeze Pop song.
9917298	9918979	I don't care that we're kind of off on a tangent right now.
9919679	9920199	It's our show.
9920240	9921100	We can do whatever we want.
9921400	9925862	But you have to hear this song because they talk about video games in it.
9925902	9927003	I'm only going to play a little clip of it.
9927303	9931325	But you have to listen because in the beginning they sample a speak and spell.
9932105	9933046	It is so awesome.
9933286	9933786	Listen to this.
9934086	9935547	And it spells out freeze poop.
9935567	9935807	Freeze poop.
9936511	9937952	Listen, listen, I'm not even kidding, it's awesome.
9941155	9950102	F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-O-P Wrong, try again.
9951082	9959069	F-R-E-E-Z-E-P-O-P You are correct.
9968355	9996337	Don't play with me, I'm not your toy Oh, can't you see, I am not a game boy Don't mess with me, I'm not your toy Just look at me, I am not a game boy Six AA batteries, and I'm good to go 700 milliamps, I'm here to rock the show Six AA batteries, and I'm good to go
10020995	10022376	Tell me that song is not cool.
10023557	10024558	That's pretty cool.
10024898	10026659	I'm going to play that song in its entirety later.
10026699	10027240	Just you wait.
10028961	10030002	All right, enough free spot.
10030022	10031663	Thank you, Illusion, for sending me all those songs.
10031683	10032204	It's awesome.
10034045	10034525	Let's see.
10035866	10036467	Moving on.
10037515	10040137	Rai Chan and Joyce are sending this question.
10040657	10044199	Will Orange Lounge Radio ever get a studio pet?
10045000	10048542	If they make ferrets legal, you guys should get one as your studio pet.
10048602	10051664	I was going to say, I thought the ferrets were the pets.
10051724	10052965	I was wondering where they disappeared to.
10054866	10056807	We haven't had the ferrets in the show in a long time.
10056967	10059169	I think the ferrets got buried under crap.
10059329	10060430	I don't know where the ferrets are.
10060490	10061250	They're around somewhere.
10061290	10061771	Look around.
10061791	10062351	They're somewhere.
10063314	10064655	There might be some next to your chair.
10064735	10066036	Don't you usually have them during the show?
10066056	10068457	Yeah, but if I bend over, my nose is going to start draining again.
10069798	10070899	We've got the ferrets around somewhere.
10073140	10081145	Basically, the reason why we don't have an actual pet is that... I don't know about Loki, but I am far too irresponsible to have a pet.
10081245	10081866	I will kill it.
10082226	10086108	I'm the type of person that will come home and say, Oh shit, I forgot to feed the cat this week.
10086128	10087649	It's not about caring for the pet.
10087729	10090391	It's about the $500 deposit for the pet.
10090431	10091292	Oh yeah, that's part of it too.
10091912	10092613	Fuck that.
10092633	10094093	There's a lot I could do with $500.
10094354	10096555	Like, piss it away on some computer that I won't use.
10096755	10097275	Exactly.
10097395	10100757	So, you know, I just don't have the desire to get a pet.
10101518	10107641	As far as ferrets... Yep, and besides, like BRP said, they already have a studio pet.
10107741	10108502	His name is Loki.
10109982	10114285	And ferrets actually smell very bad, even if you... I want a penthouse pet.
10115791	10117573	Ferrets are mean little shits, too.
10117914	10118515	Seriously.
10118535	10118835	No, they're not.
10118995	10119356	Yeah, they are.
10119396	10120117	Ferrets are nice.
10120137	10120777	Ferrets are evil.
10120978	10123321	They bite things, and they bite through your finger.
10123621	10124983	Only if you raise them wrong.
10125003	10129849	And at night, and after midnight, if you feed it, they turn into rabid little creatures and...
10130396	10132338	What do you keep him around?
10133459	10134500	Because he actually pays rent.
10134520	10136742	But that's funny and we can tape him and put him on the internet.
10136802	10137582	Yeah, and he pays rent.
10137883	10140024	Would a ferret go out and get a job and pay rent?
10140125	10140765	I don't think so.
10141486	10142907	My friend's ferrets were cool.
10143427	10146790	He named them Kodo and Podo and he was going to give them to me before I moved out here.
10147891	10149653	And then I found out that I couldn't have ferrets out here.
10151371	10160381	Rightchan would just like to add that Joyce is saying, Joyce has a pair of really sweet ferrets, and she says, ferrets you don't because they are like a large hamster.
10160401	10163744	Well, they're like a really small cat mixed with a hamster.
10165606	10166367	Just what I need.
10167368	10168349	A giant hamster.
10169090	10171212	Think of all the gay jokes I'd hear with that one.
10172213	10172714	What'd you sit on?
10172734	10173054	Exactly.
10173114	10173615	Exactly.
10180785	10183307	I'm getting told by Joyce.
10183347	10184148	Don't get me started.
10184188	10185409	I know how to take care of ferrets.
10185489	10186890	Do not underestimate ferrets.
10188511	10191234	They're illegal in California.
10192174	10193495	California says no to ferrets.
10194156	10195357	They will terminate the ferrets.
10199520	10201261	That's got to be one of the worst Arnold impressions.
10201462	10203163	I don't get paid to impersonate Arnold.
10204224	10208447	Did you see that stupid TV movie that they're doing
10209263	10218368	Did you see that movie that they're doing about the governor?
10218969	10219849	No, what about it?
10220149	10225132	It has this old guy that doesn't look or sound like Arnold, but it's supposed to be him.
10225773	10226433	It sucks.
10231716	10232336	That is all.
10232717	10234337	So that would be like me playing Arnold.
10235018	10235378	Yes.
10236179	10236759	California!
10240983	10254771	Dark Knight is sending a question.
10254811	10258633	Hey, quick question thinking about the Capcom and Namco thing.
10258693	10259793	This was posted to our website.
10259813	10261834	They're doing a Capcom cross Namco game.
10262075	10264236	It's going to be like an RPG featuring both characters.
10264756	10269939	I was wondering if Namco and Sega will finally do a Tekken versus Virtua Fighter game for real.
10269959	10270239	I don't know.
10270427	10272248	God, I hope not, because I hate Virtua Fighter.
10273609	10279073	Honestly, we are really not the people to be asking on that subject.
10280514	10283215	Write letters, show love, maybe it'll happen, you know?
10283296	10286578	I just want Tekken 5 to be out now.
10287498	10288139	On console?
10288479	10288739	Yes.
10288779	10289880	That'd be pretty hot.
10290800	10293482	Dan's saving a Tekken 5 poster for me to go in my cubicle.
10296024	10296844	When is that supposed to come out?
10296884	10297485	Do we have a release?
10298405	10298806	I don't know.
10298966	10299086	Hmm.
10300206	10302707	I honestly don't know.
10302987	10303627	That would be neat.
10303787	10305908	Crossover games can be neat, but we don't know.
10306748	10308288	Here's a question maybe we can help with.
10309889	10310449	Let's see.
10311029	10313350	Dark Knight says, another question I need your help on.
10313410	10317651	Choosing an anime character to dress up as when I go to a local convention in June.
10318311	10323772	Should I dress up as a character from B-Blade or Lan from Mega... You will so be laughed at.
10324053	10326273	Or Lan from Mega Man and T-Series?
10328414	10329314	Go with the second one.
10331252	10333013	I think you should dress up as a milkmaid.
10334934	10335695	Super Milk John?
10336335	10336615	Yes.
10338756	10341598	Go as Ranma, because it's one of the only animes I've actually seen.
10343219	10343559	Okay.
10344800	10348462	Ranma cosplay should have been buried five years ago.
10349743	10350804	What about Sailor Menchi?
10355006	10356567	That really killed everyone right there.
10357267	10358048	Now, the last...
10358937	10364521	AX I went to, though, had an Utena cosplayer who went as Utena in the boy's uniform.
10366503	10369846	And it was a guy cosplaying her who looked very female.
10372087	10374309	But it was really good cosplay.
10374349	10377432	And then he went around later in the girl's style with the shorts and everything.
10378913	10382295	And then there was the Umi cosplayer who was a guy at Faname 2001.
10387319	10388160	What's it the mob asked?
10392789	10394269	I don't even know how to pronounce that.
10394549	10395389	It's Dumabass.
10396529	10397629	No, it's Dumas.
10398870	10399690	Mr. Dumas.
10400150	10402930	I love it when people make typos and everybody jumps on them.
10403310	10404711	Ha ha, you said Dumabass.
10405771	10407491	Let's start internet trend now.
10407891	10411892	Whenever you say dumbass or type dumbass, always spell it like that.
10412152	10412772	Dumubass.
10414952	10415792	Just like pwned.
10416373	10417273	You heard it here first.
10417333	10417933	Dumubass.
10418133	10418773	Dumubass.
10422856	10423857	Shut up, you demubass.
10425418	10426800	Alright, let's see.
10427040	10430523	Smells like demubass.
10430583	10433146	Joyce wanted to clarify a few things about the pet ferret.
10434287	10434827	They're tasty.
10434927	10438811	She's getting... That is not what she's saying.
10438991	10439472	You sure?
10440072	10440753	As I'm sure.
10441906	10448747	It became illegal because of wrong scientific information in the 1930s that they are wild animals and non-domesticated.
10449188	10453108	They've been domesticated for so long that they couldn't survive in the wild.
10453508	10456849	The AFA is working on getting them legalized in California.
10458269	10459830	But in the meantime, you know what?
10460070	10463010	I don't want to go to jail over a ferret.
10463391	10464871	I don't want to be sitting next to Bubba.
10464891	10467431	They're just going to slap a fine on you.
10467671	10468692	What are you in here for?
10469612	10470332	You know, I asked Bubba.
10470891	10472352	Bubba, what are you in here for?
10473473	10475414	I'm in here for committing murder.
10475815	10477596	I murdered a guy over drugs.
10478317	10480118	What are you in here for, gay boy?
10480898	10481659	I owned a ferret.
10481679	10486342	Okay, you're not going to go to jail for owning a ferret, but that would be funny.
10486583	10487884	That would be a great sitcom.
10489144	10489985	Another big guy.
10490706	10493107	I'm in here for ripping the tag off a pillow.
10495249	10497831	It's another episode of Bubba and the Gay!
10503143	10505164	Oh my god, this ferret was tearing apart my curtains.
10505284	10505964	I was so mad.
10507545	10513027	I just had an image of a little Korean lady in the background going, Are you the gay?
10514228	10515168	Are you the gay?
10515188	10517269	The Korean lady can be like the warden.
10520170	10524872	I think it would be very funny to put gay man and bubba in the same cell.
10524932	10525712	What is that accent?
10525732	10526633	I don't even know what I'm doing.
10527133	10527553	Forget it.
10528414	10529254	Korean-Italian?
10532717	10534017	Really Spicy Spaghetti, I guess?
10534238	10535318	You got a purty mouth.
10535358	10539139	My ferret had a purty mouth.
10539159	10540380	Because we're demubasses.
10559042	10560203	You need to come here more often.
10560343	10561144	Yes, yes, I know.
10561384	10563166	So people... Now, let me finish the question.
10563526	10567850	Why doesn't someone change the webcam so people don't look at the couch the whole time?
10568431	10570293	Because it's not going to be pointed at me.
10571474	10572335	Yeah, we have a ban.
10572435	10575538	Jamie is banning herself from the camera.
10575758	10577740	I'll get on the fucking cam.
10578220	10580082	Jamie's going to go supermodel on the cam.
10580342	10581283	Oh, fuck a cam.
10581363	10581584	Alright.
10586044	10589907	Alright, Jamie's inching her way towards the cam so that you can see something new.
10590668	10592949	Basically, what are you doing?
10594671	10595811	Jamie's made her way to the cam.
10595832	10597273	Okay, Jamie is on the cam right now.
10597313	10600655	A little piece of Jamie for you guys on the cam.
10603758	10611804	Basically, the way the cam is set up, it's actually inside that massive arcade cabinet that Loki has set up.
10611924	10614726	And it's a real bitch to take the eye toy out of it.
10615399	10616560	and put it somewhere else.
10617841	10619722	Now, there have been previous episodes.
10619762	10623505	There was an episode not that long ago where we actually had the iToyCam pointed over this way.
10623525	10631311	Well, it's not really that much of a bitch to take... Yes, it's a huge bitch to take out of the cabinet.
10632292	10636975	Oh my god, the... Yeah, exactly what... Yes.
10638416	10639277	Pain in the dumb ass.
10640954	10642356	We're going to make this catch on.
10642656	10643296	You're going to like it.
10643316	10644357	It's just like Death Cake.
10644858	10647861	The chat room has a request for you to do your grudge face on cam.
10651344	10651985	She's going to do it.
10652045	10653346	I don't have a grudge face.
10653887	10655088	It's just me with my mouth open.
10659092	10659632	Think fish.
10662916	10663156	No.
10663436	10664117	All right, illusion.
10664137	10664317	Illusion.
10665476	10666197	as a question.
10666817	10670260	Since you've got 10 minutes of no questions, I suppose I'll ask another.
10670320	10673642	Hey, what's your favorite freeze pop song?
10674563	10676744	Obviously, I'm having an orgasm over them recently.
10679306	10680467	Science Genius Girl remix.
10681428	10681948	The live one.
10683069	10685291	Dude, you know what Science Genius Girl remix rocks?
10688073	10688393	None of them.
10689134	10691495	No, Loki, none of them is not the correct answer.
10691515	10693697	We're going to kick you in the dumb ass now.
10694184	10694525	I know.
10695688	10696811	Don't be such a demub-ass.
10698595	10701883	It's the Science Genius Girl mix that sounds like it was done on a Game Boy.
10701963	10702404	Listen to this.
10702424	10702966	It's so cool.
10730785	10739230	Fun times two times three When I clone a human being Isn't that cool?
10739270	10739750	I want that.
10739770	10740310	Send that to me.
10740370	10741071	Isn't that cool?
10742391	10744753	I think we might use that in a show intro, like, later on.
10745153	10746073	That would so rock.
10748815	10749915	Pardon me, Bison coming through.
10751456	10754478	Dark Knight's pissed because we're making fun of his demubass comment.
10754738	10757640	Well, he's such a demubass, we're not even being able to spell demubass correctly.
10758100	10759260	Aw, but we love him.
10759541	10760241	It's alright.
10762601	10763001	Alright.
10763702	10764382	Oh boy, oh boy.
10768805	10770146	Yeah, think about it this way, Dark Knight.
10770186	10774269	You are on the cutting edge of a new internet trend.
10781193	10789299	My favorite freeze pop song for the record would be the... Oh God, I forgot the name of it.
10790259	10791140	What a fan I am.
10792645	10794967	I think we're about wrapping up the show.
10794987	10798789	We're pretty much done, boys and girls.
10798809	10801731	But we have to get everybody's final thought before this show can be over.
10801751	10802431	Bug, your final thought.
10825473	10826273	Angel, your final thought?
10828075	10829176	Online games are addicting.
10830377	10831018	DarkSakura?
10840186	10841348	Loki, your final thought?
10843049	10847013	My final thought is I made a mess and didn't do anything and
10848430	10849431	Now I'm back to square one.
10849451	10850792	You made a mess, now clean it up.
10851152	10852593	I did clean it up, that's what I'm doing right now.
10853054	10856957	But, uh... I hate this stupid thing.
10857177	10857658	You know what?
10857858	10862382	I could have bought a laptop for the money and built this damn thing and it would have been more powerful, too.
10862642	10863102	Probably.
10863543	10864043	Go figure.
10864063	10865184	But not as leet.
10865944	10866885	I guess, whatever.
10867085	10867366	Alright.
10868467	10869327	Um, let's see.
10869347	10873611	Um... And then, um...
10875928	10880170	My final thought would be 1-800-96-JERRY.
10880390	10881131	That's my final thought.
10882511	10884552	The final word of tonight's show.
10885212	10885533	Bugged.
10885553	10886613	I'm going to give it to you, buddy.
10886873	10888354	One word to sum it all up.
10888934	10889535	This show.

10995115	10996536	I just found a bootleg site.
10996936	11000098	Somebody's posting episodes of this show up on a bootleg page.
11000719	11001379	We should sue them.
11001799	11002540	We're going to sue.
