04:57.220 --> 05:02.220

Say hello to Iguana Girl. Uh, hi. Yo, what up?

05:47.420 --> 05:51.060
How you doing? That mic's a little quiet. I was noticing that.

05:51.060 --> 05:55.020
From the gut. You don't want me to go from there.

05:55.020 --> 05:59.900
I'm blasting everybody out. You gotta yell like you're yelling at newbies.

05:59.900 --> 06:03.340

06:03.340 --> 06:07.380
Alright, also joining us tonight

06:10.940 --> 06:14.540
How you doing? Oh, good and loud. Absolutely.

06:14.540 --> 06:18.980
I learned my lesson. We have a new microphone. We finally, after about four weeks, replaced

06:18.980 --> 06:21.140
that microphone that was cutting out for our guests,

06:21.140 --> 06:26.520
but it's a little quiet so because we had to play some mic roulette actually

06:26.520 --> 06:33.800
so yeah anyway also say hello to joining us on this show it hasn't been here in

06:33.800 --> 06:41.080

06:41.080 --> 06:46.480

06:46.480 --> 06:52.800

06:58.280 --> 07:04.160
well I'm late ah now they would have never known that because you were here

07:04.160 --> 07:07.360
right before your to but you just had to go and spill all the beans and now they

07:07.360 --> 07:12.440
knew you're tired our webcam wasn't even on they couldn't see all right anyway

07:12.440 --> 07:16.200
Can I just start off by saying, I love our chat room.

07:16.200 --> 07:20.960
I love our chat room, www.orangelandsrader.com, click on chat.

07:20.960 --> 07:26.520
I love this. MPQ in chat says, every time I hear the opening I think my mom will

07:26.520 --> 07:28.400
think I'm looking at porn or something,

07:28.400 --> 07:32.520
because you know we have that sexy voice in there. You're listening to Orangelsands, right?

07:32.520 --> 07:36.240
And then somebody else replies here, uh, shade23 says,

07:36.240 --> 07:42.240
well why aren't you?

07:42.240 --> 07:52.240
Great. All right. Well, join in the fun by heading on over to our chat room, or be a loser and just, you know, sit there in the background and just listen to us in the background. No, that's fine.

07:52.240 --> 07:55.240
We understand some of you guys have more important things you might be trying to do right now, like-

07:55.240 --> 07:56.240
Masturbating.

07:56.240 --> 07:57.240
Homework, or-

07:57.240 --> 07:58.240
Masturbating.

07:58.240 --> 08:02.240
Masturbating to pornography. Fair enough. All right.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.240
But we're going to keep the music and talk coming to you guys.

08:06.240 --> 08:10.240
First off, I thought we might be able to do some music from 2DX Red.

08:10.240 --> 08:14.240
Big 2DX game released last year. Now I can say last year, because we're in 2005.

08:14.240 --> 08:18.240
So big 2DX game released last year. We're going to hear some music from 2DX Red.

08:18.240 --> 08:22.240
And when we come back, all that randomness and chatter you've come to expect

08:22.240 --> 08:29.240
your buddies here at Orange Lounge Radio. We'll be back!

09:52.240 --> 09:54.240
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

09:54.240 --> 09:56.240
Thank you so much for watching!

09:56.240 --> 09:58.240
I'll see you in the next video!

10:58.240 --> 11:23.240
Make my head to my head to my head

11:23.240 --> 11:30.240
Be quiet, be quiet, be quiet, be quiet

14:23.240 --> 14:33.240
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

14:33.240 --> 14:39.240
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

14:39.240 --> 14:41.240
No subject will ever be taboo.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.240
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

14:45.240 --> 14:48.240
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

14:48.240 --> 14:53.000
discussion okay well what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of

14:53.000 --> 14:58.920
the attack music we play on the station I collect your fucking head just like

14:58.920 --> 15:05.080
this fucker here oh my god why did you do that to Loki the

15:05.080 --> 15:11.920
thing on episode 69 was just a joke now if any of you sons of bitches got

15:11.920 --> 15:16.120
anything else to say now's the fucking time

15:16.120 --> 15:26.120
orange lounge radio where everybody has to say hello everybody and welcome back

15:26.120 --> 15:32.420

15:32.420 --> 15:37.100
in it $1.25 I don't know maybe maybe not dollar and a quarter I don't know

15:37.100 --> 15:42.900

15:42.900 --> 15:47.560

15:47.560 --> 15:50.420
know you guys love to interact with the show whether be via the chat room or via

15:50.420 --> 15:54.140
the skype line which I should sign into at some point but we will have orange

15:54.140 --> 15:56.700
already on the skype line so you can call in later in the show if you want

15:56.700 --> 16:01.540
and all that good stuff just sitting here sitting back talking about music

16:01.540 --> 16:06.140
based video games and, you know, Bamani-type games, and just, you know, really anything

16:06.140 --> 16:10.220
that doesn't suck is fair game here. And even some stuff that does suck. We have a whole

16:10.220 --> 16:14.260
segment dedicated to that. So, we'll get into that a little later. But first, we have to

16:14.260 --> 16:20.020
start off tonight's show. We start off every week's show, 125 episodes, nothing's changed.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.860
How was your week? How was your day? And we're going to start it off with a lovely, dark

16:23.860 --> 16:26.540
Sakura who actually wasn't here last week because you were sick last week, right?

16:26.540 --> 16:31.540
I was. I was actually pretty damn tired last week.

16:31.540 --> 16:34.540
That's too bad to hear. Everything okay? But you seem good now.

16:34.540 --> 16:36.540
But I have sexy jeans.

16:36.540 --> 16:38.540
I haven't taken a look at your sexy jeans here.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.540
I'm not wearing them. They're in the washer.

16:41.540 --> 16:45.540
Oh, okay. Well, we want to see your sexy jeans. This is why we have a webcam.

16:45.540 --> 16:50.540
Half of them are recessive. Actually, a quarter of them are recessive.

16:50.540 --> 16:51.540
How does that work?

16:51.540 --> 16:58.500
jeans are a quarter as fast as everybody's are.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.980
How was your week, how was your day?

17:00.980 --> 17:06.100
My week was, you know, I was getting all pissed off and stressed out at work, and then I went

17:06.100 --> 17:08.500
to a job interview on Wednesday.

17:08.500 --> 17:16.540
The next day I get called and offered the position, the damn next day, so I'm going

17:16.540 --> 17:24.040
I'm going to be changing from the exciting world of student loans going into the exciting world, again, of home mortgages.

17:24.040 --> 17:26.040
I'm going to be working in the escrow department.

17:26.040 --> 17:30.540
Which is something probably I would estimate that 98% of our listeners know nothing about.

17:30.540 --> 17:35.540
I would have to say that 98% of home owners know nothing about.

17:35.540 --> 17:42.040
Considering our average age of the listener would be about, what, 12? I don't know. No, I'm kidding.

17:42.040 --> 17:48.360
I don't know. But, well, more seriously, probably, I think, we've got our high schoolers, then

17:48.360 --> 17:51.280
we have our twenty-somethings. A few of them might know.

17:51.280 --> 17:55.280
Few of them might know. Well, for the people who probably have no

17:55.280 --> 17:59.720
idea what escrow is, at least in the sense that I'm doing, you know, you always hear

17:59.720 --> 18:05.360
closing escrow when you're buying a house. What an actual escrow is, is when you have,

18:05.360 --> 18:09.280
you know, when you pay for your mortgage, your mortgage company has the option of paying

18:09.280 --> 18:15.100
your taxes and insurance with your with your with your house payment so they

18:15.100 --> 18:18.880
will actually set it up to where you have the money in a separate holding

18:18.880 --> 18:21.900
account which is an escrow account to pay your taxes and insurance that's what

18:21.900 --> 18:24.780
I'm going to be doing is making sure that they're managed properly because if

18:24.780 --> 18:29.200
they're not gives people lots of trouble with the government makes people really

18:29.200 --> 18:34.700
poor because trust me when you go to buy a house don't be a retard about it come

18:34.700 --> 18:44.660
talk to me anyway so I'll so make making some changes other changes and as of

18:44.660 --> 18:51.380
tomorrow I am back on the straight and narrow for my big resolution I'm going

18:51.380 --> 18:56.700
to say this on the air tonight oh see last year I lost 50 pounds this year I'm

18:56.700 --> 19:02.500
going to lose another 50 there you're gonna be a toothpick but before long

19:02.500 --> 19:04.500
How long do you keep losing all this weight?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
I don't think so. Not the way I'm doing it.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.500
Alright.

19:07.500 --> 19:10.500
I want like the Linda Hamilton Terminator 2 look. I want it to be tough.

19:10.500 --> 19:11.500
Okay.

19:11.500 --> 19:12.500
I want to kick people's ass.

19:12.500 --> 19:13.500
Alright.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.500
And then take out a submachine gun and go blow away. Oh, sorry.

19:16.500 --> 19:22.500
I'm also going to take gun safety classes this year.

19:22.500 --> 19:27.500
Oh no. I remember this was the discussion last January.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.500
Is that Jamie was going to get a gun.

19:29.500 --> 19:31.500
I couldn't afford a gun last year.

19:31.500 --> 19:35.500
Thankfully the discussion went away for a while and now, great, it's back.

19:35.500 --> 19:38.500
Jamie got a gun.

19:38.500 --> 19:41.500
Okay, you know what?

19:41.500 --> 19:46.500
When I go postal, the first place I'm coming is here.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.500
Seriously, though.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.500
Come on, it couldn't resist that one.

19:51.500 --> 19:57.500
Um, I'm gonna, you know, we're talking about getting like, you know, a little crappy.22 rifle, but I'm gonna work up.

19:57.500 --> 20:01.060
Remind me again. What do you need a gun for?

20:01.060 --> 20:05.100
You shoot stuff, duh! Stress relief!

20:05.100 --> 20:10.460
Stress relief, she says. What are you gonna be shooting? You're not gonna be going to golf?

20:10.460 --> 20:13.460
An anime object. You're not gonna be going to golf land, are you?

20:13.460 --> 20:18.100
RVGL children. You have to remember that Roseville Golf Land, for those who have never

20:18.100 --> 20:19.980
been there, one of our local arcades we play at,

20:19.980 --> 20:24.540
it's two stories and not a lot goes on on the second story. Except me with a

20:24.540 --> 20:25.340
sniper rifle.

20:25.340 --> 20:30.300
exactly that's my fear defile my machine I dare you

20:30.300 --> 20:34.180
don't you think it would be quite humorous though if they put like a

20:34.180 --> 20:38.780
silent scope machine up there dude that'd be rad

20:40.700 --> 20:47.420
anyway I was sick on Christmas Day I'm sorry I was sick with like this nasty

20:47.420 --> 21:00.620
fatigue, which actually lasted into Sunday. I got up, I went to breakfast, went to bed.

21:00.620 --> 21:06.260
Got up, went to dinner over at Dan's aunt's house. Then when he was, I said, just take

21:06.260 --> 21:10.020
me home. I'm not going to be able to hang out with your cousins. He's like, let's go

21:10.020 --> 21:17.020
go play DDR at your cousin's house. No. No, Jamie, go bed. I went home. I sat up for about

21:17.300 --> 21:21.700
an hour just, you know, checking my email, settling stuff. My ass was in bed. I was like,

21:21.700 --> 21:28.700
no, I can't deal with it. So, I was asleep for most of Christmas. Well, you know, in

21:29.660 --> 21:32.720
some ways, sometimes it's better that way to be asleep for Christmas. But I did get

21:32.720 --> 21:39.720
nifty presents. I got gift cards. Which means that the day after, I was basically wearing

21:39.720 --> 21:44.680
myself out shopping, but it was fun. It was very fun. I went shopping with Tia and Jessica

21:44.680 --> 21:53.040
and we had a fun time. The day after Christmas is kind of a nightmare shopping day though,

21:53.040 --> 21:59.440
because I remember that I was at Best Buy I think that day and I just, oh my gosh, it

21:59.440 --> 22:05.360
was crazy. The line was going around the block. It was pretty crazy. Just the thing is that

22:05.360 --> 22:11.320
But I didn't have, I mean, basically I was really, really, I shouldn't, by all rights

22:11.320 --> 22:17.440
have been out, but it's the day after freaking Christmas, sales, you know, womanly instinct

22:17.440 --> 22:22.760
is stronger than fatigue sometimes.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.040
And then I had an egg nug frappuccino.

22:26.040 --> 22:29.740
I wish Starbucks would never get rid of those, because they're so good, and I know they're

22:29.740 --> 22:32.840
going to be gone Monday, probably, makes me sad.

22:32.840 --> 22:37.140
I'm actually glad they're gone because they prove to be too much temptation, especially

22:37.140 --> 22:38.140
with the Starbucks.

22:38.140 --> 22:42.220
You know, the one thing that keeps me away from the Starbucks by my present location

22:42.220 --> 22:46.140
of work is the fact that it's right by a freaking Target.

22:46.140 --> 22:50.600
So traffic is enough to keep me away.

22:50.600 --> 22:54.720
I know a lot of people out there are very, very anti-Starbucks.

22:54.720 --> 22:58.280
And for those of you guys that don't have a Starbucks in your neighborhood, just wait.

22:58.280 --> 22:59.760
You'll have one soon.

22:59.760 --> 23:00.760
It's a coffee shop.

23:00.760 --> 23:01.760
For those that didn't know, it's huge.

23:01.760 --> 23:07.040
Mississippi orgy going on. It is law. I'm talking Starbucks, hold on.

23:07.040 --> 23:10.800
Mississippi orgy can wait. It's kind of week and day. Two.

23:10.800 --> 23:14.280
But I just want to say Starbucks, it's not as bad as you people make it out to be.

23:14.280 --> 23:18.200
They have great, some of their coffee is so good. Even if it is a month old.

23:18.200 --> 23:21.440
Yeah, anyway I'm sorry to interrupt. Their coffee means our month old.

23:21.440 --> 23:26.760
At least. But now in Mississippi it's law that if you have

23:26.760 --> 23:31.080
more than three people in the same room, at least of course one has to be of a

23:31.080 --> 23:36.520
different gender and they're not wearing shoes it's an orgy in the state of

23:36.520 --> 23:41.200
Mississippi. You have got to be kidding. I'm not kidding you at all. It is true. So let's

23:41.200 --> 23:45.520
see, Jamie doesn't have shoes on. The guana girl doesn't have shoes on. I don't

23:45.520 --> 23:52.680
have shoes on. Thank God we're not in Mississippi. Sorry people in Mississippi.

23:52.680 --> 23:58.800
But thank God. With all due respect to our friends in Mississippi, thank God

23:58.800 --> 24:07.080
were not you and and you know I actually have room to say this because I've been

24:07.080 --> 24:13.400
in Mississippi I'm from Alabama I have been in Mississippi quite a bit my mom

24:13.400 --> 24:24.400
works in Biloxi I like California um and also as far as the rest of my weekend

24:24.400 --> 24:31.400
have been, it's just been, today has been kind of, yesterday was really just weird for

24:31.400 --> 24:36.840
me. I'd have to say it ended well, it ended very well. That's good. But today has just

24:36.840 --> 24:40.960
been like, ugh, rain, ugh. I noticed you were a little drained yesterday. We were doing

24:40.960 --> 24:48.080
the top 10, 14 show, whatever, 10 or 14, whatever it was, over on DDR Freak Radio, and I think

24:48.080 --> 24:51.560
we were all feeling a little drained after that. Yesterday morning. I think we were just

24:51.560 --> 24:56.480
used to doing these these things on Sunday nights so well I had tried to

24:56.480 --> 25:00.560
stay up doing and see that this is actually I did Bimani stuff this weekend

25:00.560 --> 25:06.800

25:06.800 --> 25:19.080
stupid Safari stupid B stupid a stupid Sakura that's not me but anyway I also

25:19.080 --> 25:23.520
though they made me play karaoke revolution and they had kr3 and so I

25:23.520 --> 25:26.620
knew the only way that I'd get to here waiting for you is if I was the one to

25:26.620 --> 25:30.620
sing it so I was like okay well I'll do that and I was like oh that song's cool

25:30.620 --> 25:34.080

25:54.260 --> 25:59.120
did something really stupid the night before after consuming two bottles of

25:59.120 --> 26:04.720
Guinness in ten minutes and for those of you that were listening about six

26:04.720 --> 26:08.080
months ago when we had our last drunk show was it that one I think it was oh

26:08.080 --> 26:13.820
yeah when I passed out in your bed and then proceeded to eat four waffles that's

26:13.820 --> 26:17.420

27:48.340 --> 27:49.340
eBay.

27:49.340 --> 27:52.380
Did you remember that guy that sold the French toast that had the Virgin Mary's likeness

27:52.380 --> 27:53.380
in it?

27:53.380 --> 27:54.380
Wasn't he like 10 years old or something?

27:54.380 --> 27:59.740
Yeah, he had saved it for 10 years and finally was like, time to move on.

27:59.740 --> 28:02.940
Anyway, sorry to keep interrupting you.

28:02.940 --> 28:06.260
That reminds me of, do you remember the old Bloom County comics?

28:06.260 --> 28:07.260
Yeah.

28:07.260 --> 28:09.060
The first Opus ones?

28:09.060 --> 28:14.580
had the one about the woman who had the image of Elvis in mold on her refrigerator and then

28:14.580 --> 28:23.020
later on the crowds dispersed because it turned into Mr. Ed, the mold crew. But anyway, I'm

28:23.020 --> 28:29.100
in a much better mood now than I was, but I was in crap, crap mood all day. So I'm happy

28:29.100 --> 28:30.100
now.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.100
Alright, yay happy.

28:31.100 --> 28:35.580
Look at me grin. And of course the people listening will never ever see this because

28:35.580 --> 28:36.580
I fear...

28:36.580 --> 28:37.580
Webcams.

28:37.580 --> 28:38.580
...the webcam.

28:38.580 --> 28:42.900
fair enough. Alright, let's move on.

28:42.900 --> 28:46.100
Loki! We haven't heard a lot from you yet tonight, how was your week, how was your day?

28:46.100 --> 28:50.500
But little does she realize, we've hidden a hidden camera up above Rob

28:50.500 --> 28:53.380
to capture her, without her knowing- oh, just a second.

28:53.380 --> 28:56.380
You can bite me.

28:56.380 --> 28:59.580
Hot Orange Lounge upskirt cam dot com!

28:59.580 --> 29:02.380
I'm wearing... I'm wearing jeans. Doesn't work.

29:02.380 --> 29:03.880
This is why nobody visits that site.

29:09.180 --> 29:10.580
Yeah, Rob's the one wearing the skirt.

29:13.880 --> 29:14.380
Zoinks!

29:15.680 --> 29:16.580
Anyways, um...

29:19.080 --> 29:19.980
How this week sucked.

29:20.580 --> 29:21.080
That's it.

29:21.780 --> 29:22.480
Didn't do anything.

29:23.480 --> 29:24.880
Um, what'd I do yesterday?

29:25.180 --> 29:26.280
Oh, that's right, nothing.

29:26.580 --> 29:27.480
And, um...

29:27.480 --> 29:29.480
New Year's Eve?

29:57.480 --> 30:01.480
Yeah, that's about it.

30:01.480 --> 30:05.480
Alright, I'll go later, so let's hear from some guests.

30:05.480 --> 30:09.480
Where's the mic getting handed over there? Alright, Jazz! Who, by the way,

30:09.480 --> 30:13.480
won one of our Kiryamoka CDs. Yay!

30:13.480 --> 30:17.480
And if I remember right, one of the rules for the contest was that being here so many times

30:17.480 --> 30:21.480
rendered you ineligible, but you were just under that? Yeah.

30:21.480 --> 30:25.480
I've been here once before. Okay, so now this is your second. What was it, like three times?

30:25.480 --> 30:29.480
It's kind of funny if this would push you over that limit after you've already won the contest, but...

30:29.480 --> 30:31.480
Hee hee hee. Technicalities rule.

30:31.480 --> 30:34.480
Alright. Didn't you end up giving away that CD to one of your friends?

30:34.480 --> 30:36.480
Yes, for Christmas I gave it to my best friend.

30:36.480 --> 30:37.480
And what did she say?

30:37.480 --> 30:39.480
She said, oh my god, a bunch of times.

30:39.480 --> 30:40.480
That was very funny.

30:40.480 --> 30:42.480
Aww, how cute.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.480
Aww, I'm glad she enjoyed it. Alright.

30:44.480 --> 30:51.480
Alright. Well, for my week, I basically just came up to Sacramento on Friday night for New Year's Eve.

30:51.480 --> 30:57.200
that was fun because we all played Mario Party and that was fun because me and

30:57.200 --> 31:02.280
Rob were princesses and every time we got team together we would kick ass you

31:02.280 --> 31:05.640
don't understand you don't understand there's a rule about when Rob plays

31:05.640 --> 31:10.760
Mario Party I have to be Princess Peach or I throw a fit like a little baby okay

31:10.760 --> 31:18.560
so I took daisy because Robert took peach and I got mad anyway after New

31:18.560 --> 31:25.560
years I slept for a little bit then I woke up and then I came here for the top

31:25.560 --> 31:31.240
14 show and that was fun and then we went back to Jessica's place and we all

31:31.240 --> 31:41.880
slept together no oh actually we played rumble roses a lot and that was sorry

31:41.880 --> 31:46.800
no don't be sorry that's a great game it's hilarious rumble roses is pretty

31:46.800 --> 31:56.800
The story mode is just hilarious for that game and so today I went to RVGL for the first time in, like, ever.

31:56.800 --> 31:57.800
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

31:57.800 --> 31:58.800
Actually, it wasn't too bad.

31:58.800 --> 32:03.800
It's not as bad as like it was about a year ago. If you'd gone about a year ago, it would have been like, oh boy.

32:03.800 --> 32:10.800
But now, you know, it's improving. Did you say hello to the new 2DX machine that has no monitor?

32:10.800 --> 32:10.800
Yes.

32:10.800 --> 32:12.800
Oh, okay. Just curious.

32:12.800 --> 32:19.800
Let's see, uh, basically I just played Tekken 5 all day, and that was fun, because I finally

32:19.800 --> 32:24.120
have a card, even though it costs $5, but I don't care, because it's a good game, it's

32:24.120 --> 32:25.120
good, dammit.

32:25.120 --> 32:26.120
$5?

32:26.120 --> 32:27.120
It's $5 for a card.

32:27.120 --> 32:29.880
Dude, I got one in Alabama for one.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.880
Is it gold-plated or something?

32:31.880 --> 32:32.880
No.

32:32.880 --> 32:33.880
It's like a credit card.

32:33.880 --> 32:36.280
I'll show you mine in a moment, you can put it on the cam.

32:36.280 --> 32:41.040
I went to an Amco arcade, though, they had Tekken 5, like, forever, and no one was playing

32:41.040 --> 32:49.040
So I was like, shoot, I paid $10 worth of Tekken 5, $1 if it was my card.

32:49.040 --> 32:51.540
The chick related to Jun.

32:51.540 --> 32:52.540
Asuka?

32:52.540 --> 32:53.540
Asuka, yeah.

32:53.540 --> 32:54.540
Same person as you.

32:54.540 --> 32:58.860
Just because Jun's moves are not fun anymore.

32:58.860 --> 33:02.340
I'm kind of a Tekken retard, so explain something to me.

33:02.340 --> 33:06.460
What exactly is the difference between Tekken 4 and Tekken 5, besides the card thing?

33:06.460 --> 33:09.020
Tekken 4 was dumb and Tekken 5 isn't.

33:09.020 --> 33:10.580
I like Tekken 4.

33:10.580 --> 33:13.300
I liked Tekken 4 a whole bunch.

33:13.300 --> 33:18.060
Tekken 4 was basically, to me, it seemed like Tekken was trying to be like DOA, and it did

33:18.060 --> 33:20.140
not work at all for me.

33:20.140 --> 33:24.140
And Tekken 5 is a lot more like Tag, which I loved, so it worked a lot for better.

33:24.140 --> 33:28.620
I didn't care for Tag, but I do like Tekken 5 just because I was a Jun player in Tekken

33:28.620 --> 33:29.620
2.

33:29.620 --> 33:30.620
Wait, it's...

33:30.620 --> 33:32.540
And that's why I played Jin, because I was also a Kazuya player.

33:32.540 --> 33:33.540
Yeah.

33:33.540 --> 33:34.540
And he was like the best.

33:34.540 --> 33:36.020
Who's the guy without the shirt that all the girls swoon over?

33:36.020 --> 33:37.020
Jin.

33:37.020 --> 33:38.020
Jin.

33:38.020 --> 33:39.020
Then again, there's also Pho Rong.

33:39.020 --> 33:40.020
But he was the Korean guy with the red hair.

33:40.020 --> 33:42.020
No, I'm not talking about Hora, I'm talking about you guys.

33:42.020 --> 33:44.020
Okay. Is Jin in Tekken 5?

33:44.020 --> 33:45.020
Yes.

33:45.020 --> 33:46.020
Okay.

33:46.020 --> 33:47.020
And he's still hot.

33:47.020 --> 33:49.020
Okay. That was my next question. Thank you.

33:49.020 --> 33:52.020
And that was about it.

33:52.020 --> 33:57.020
Alrighty. Let's move on to Islander. How was your week? How was your day?

33:57.020 --> 34:07.020
Uh, week was actually pretty good. Pretty good. Just spent all, work was so damn slow that I just spent my entire day trying to find stuff to do.

34:07.020 --> 34:10.860
It was to the point where we were cutting papers for screw or like for just for scratch paper

34:11.140 --> 34:15.660
And I must spend about a day doing that just out of shear borgen. It was horrible

34:16.180 --> 34:19.500
Were you making little crafts out of them too? No, you know, it's really funny

34:22.180 --> 34:24.180
One of our roommates downloaded

34:24.700 --> 34:27.140
He actually printed up some hit some papers on how to make

34:27.580 --> 34:33.860
Origami rhinos and left them at work and I was half-concerting actually making some but didn't get around to doing it

34:33.860 --> 34:42.660
But, anyways, um, other than that, you know, spent New Year's, um, you know, I didn't have

34:42.660 --> 34:46.340
as many jello shots as I should have, because we still have a refrigerator full of them.

34:46.340 --> 34:49.340
Maybe I should bring them here sometime.

34:49.340 --> 34:50.340
They last a while.

34:50.340 --> 34:52.980
Well, yeah, I mean, and we have a ton.

34:52.980 --> 34:53.980
Unbelievable.

34:53.980 --> 34:54.980
Anyway.

34:54.980 --> 34:59.640
Those are some yummy jello shots, though, especially considering that they were low-carb

34:59.640 --> 35:00.640
jello shots.

35:00.640 --> 35:01.640
Absolutely.

35:01.640 --> 35:07.640
When you consider the vodka and jello, no carbs, or at least the type of jello, yes.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.640
It's lovely.

35:08.640 --> 35:09.640
Oh, absolutely.

35:09.640 --> 35:10.640
Good stuff.

35:10.640 --> 35:17.160
But yeah, like, you know, Jazz and I played a lot of Rumble Roses.

35:17.160 --> 35:22.480
When I went to Roseville today, he played second five, I played DLC, like I always do,

35:22.480 --> 35:24.760
because DLC is my crack.

35:24.760 --> 35:29.400
Is it just me, or is there now starting to become like a little Roseville Golf Land following

35:29.400 --> 35:30.400
for Derby Owners Club?

35:30.400 --> 35:31.400
No, there is, there is.

35:31.400 --> 35:33.480
I was actually playing and there was this one guy

35:33.480 --> 35:35.360
And there are people I've never seen before

35:35.360 --> 35:38.040
There was one guy who was playing and he had some pretty good horses

35:38.040 --> 35:40.500
and whenever he saw mine pop up

35:40.500 --> 35:44.320
I could always hear a sigh from the back, it's like, ah damn, I don't want to be in for it

35:44.320 --> 35:46.520
and I could not beat this fucker

35:46.520 --> 35:48.120
I could not beat him

35:48.120 --> 35:51.720
When we finally left, he actually turned around and said, hey man, you're pretty good

35:51.720 --> 35:53.680
and I was like, wow, okay

35:53.680 --> 35:57.800
Interesting, but yeah, there is a little following there and I hope it really takes off

35:57.800 --> 36:03.300
In the beginning, though, if I remember right, half the following was just Milpitas people driving up to see their machine.

36:05.300 --> 36:08.800
You know, in the end, the people calling in saying, hey, we want our machine back.

36:09.800 --> 36:10.800
Oh, whatever happened with that?

36:10.800 --> 36:11.800
How does it feel to want it?

36:11.800 --> 36:16.300
You know what, though? That does kind of suck, if you're in that area, Milpitas area, and to have a machine like that.

36:16.300 --> 36:17.800
They can go to Demon Busters, screw all of them.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.800
Oh, that's true, that's true.

36:18.800 --> 36:19.800
Poop, poop, poop.

36:19.800 --> 36:20.800
True, true, true.

36:22.300 --> 36:23.300
They can pay twice as much money.

36:23.300 --> 36:27.300
I did that for a long time. Blah.

36:27.300 --> 36:31.300
Well okay then.

36:31.300 --> 36:35.300
About RVGL though, there was one very odd

36:35.300 --> 36:39.300
thing that I saw. I was playing Drumania, sucking like usual

36:39.300 --> 36:43.300
because I don't play Drumania, and there's this guy next to me.

36:43.300 --> 36:47.300
It was obvious to me that he's kind of mentally handicapped in

36:47.300 --> 36:51.300
some way, but then he went up to the Guitar Freaks

36:51.300 --> 36:58.020
Tarfreak's screen and either licked it or sniffed it. And I was just mortified beyond

36:58.020 --> 37:03.580
all belief. Maybe he didn't understand how to play the game. He was like sniffing Tran

37:03.580 --> 37:08.260
or something. I was like, what the hell is going on? And yeah, that was a little scary

37:08.260 --> 37:15.260
so I ran away. I can smell your cunt from here! Oh no you didn't!

37:21.380 --> 37:26.860
Rob is red, this is funny. I think what made that so funny is because

37:26.860 --> 37:32.460
I was really out of nowhere. I mean, just, not only was it out of nowhere, but it was

37:32.460 --> 37:42.060
obscure that I think maybe two of our listeners got it. Anyway sorry. Rob, you forgot one

37:42.060 --> 37:48.860
more reason why it was funny. Well, that makes me want to crawl under the table because I

37:48.860 --> 37:56.260
know what's coming next. Well, he hasn't had proper warning about that. I'll let him live

37:56.260 --> 38:00.300
this time. Alright, well since you got a mic Iguana girl, let's talk about your week and

38:00.300 --> 38:06.920
your day, which was hopefully C-bomb free. It was until now, bitch. Hey, that's what

38:06.920 --> 38:12.880
we're here to do, to fulfill your naughty words quotient of the week. It's what I get

38:12.880 --> 38:19.560
for missing Rocky all this time. I have to get it someplace. The week was relatively

38:19.560 --> 38:27.640
calm. Like Jamie was saying, we did the whole big massive shopping trip on Sunday, which

38:27.640 --> 38:35.480
is pretty cool because I have really, really, really, really, really needed new clothing.

38:35.480 --> 38:41.040
I've been shrinking out of everything that I own and it's very difficult to find new

38:41.040 --> 38:44.660
clothes that are at a decent price for big people.

38:44.660 --> 38:46.920
But best new reason to buy new clothes though.

38:46.920 --> 38:47.920
Exactly.

38:47.920 --> 38:48.920
Exactly.

38:48.920 --> 38:53.080
So I took my $200 and got a bunch of new bras and all that.

38:53.080 --> 38:55.240
La, la, la, la, la.

38:55.240 --> 39:01.160
Hey, those suckers cost a lot, buddy. I paid 52 bucks for four bras and that was on sale.

39:01.160 --> 39:04.640
See, you know what? Walmart,

39:04.640 --> 39:08.360
five bucks for a three-pack undies. It's hard to find.

39:08.360 --> 39:11.560
Okay, let me put it this way. It's hard to find

39:11.560 --> 39:15.440
bras this big for cheap prices.

39:15.440 --> 39:19.720
Alright, alright. It's like, you know, it truly is an over-the-shelf brothel herder.

39:19.720 --> 39:23.280
Did you hear that, boys? Big bras. You know what that means.

39:23.280 --> 39:32.120
But, uh, we ended up going over to Old Navy and found my jackpot.

39:32.120 --> 39:37.360
I managed to get four shirts and two pairs of pants for $100, and I was all super happy

39:37.360 --> 39:42.960
because I told myself I wouldn't get anything over a certain size, and I didn't, so yay!

39:42.960 --> 39:46.520
But, uh, that's about it.

39:46.520 --> 39:49.240
My week was pretty boring.

39:49.240 --> 39:51.400
I fell asleep a lot.

39:51.400 --> 39:56.320
of the holidays are for though? Yeah. I was really tired and I pulled a butt

39:56.320 --> 40:03.000
muscle. Now how did you pull a butt muscle? I was at the gym on Friday doing

40:03.000 --> 40:09.720
my fit track appointment with Jamie's and my mutual trainer and I was doing

40:09.720 --> 40:14.520
some sort of chest press and as I stood up to move to another machine my butt

40:14.520 --> 40:20.000
muscle just went tweak and suddenly my butt muscle hurt like hell. So my butt

40:20.000 --> 40:27.000
muscles hurt ever since, kind of on and off. My butt's sore. I think I need one of those

40:27.120 --> 40:34.120
little butt pillows. Something you can strap to your bottom. Something like that. Oh my

40:38.760 --> 40:45.760
gosh, I'm so glad half our studio isn't wired up right now. Okay. That's about it. I won't

40:45.760 --> 40:47.760
I won't hurt you with more butt muscle stuff.

40:47.760 --> 40:49.760
That's alright. That's what they tune in for.

40:49.760 --> 40:51.760
And my socks are in the dryer.

40:53.760 --> 40:55.760
Because my feet were wet.

40:55.760 --> 41:01.760
This show, honestly, it's about Bamani, and it's about Iguana Girl's butt. That's it.

41:01.760 --> 41:04.760
Oh yeah, and I did that show yesterday.

41:04.760 --> 41:07.760
Oh yeah, the show. The show was good. We'll talk about the show a little bit.

41:07.760 --> 41:13.760
We don't want to recap the whole show because I assume that it's going to be played again later.

41:13.760 --> 41:16.440
but uh... you know we'll talk about the show

41:16.440 --> 41:20.220
already made my age joke for the week

41:20.220 --> 41:23.100
angel how was your week how was your day

41:23.100 --> 41:26.760
uh... pretty good i spent the holidays uh... up in the bay

41:26.760 --> 41:29.160
uh... with my folks

41:29.160 --> 41:30.300
and

41:30.300 --> 41:33.160
it was pretty good except for the fact that

41:33.160 --> 41:34.060
uh...

41:34.060 --> 41:38.600
i had internet on tuesday the day that i arrived there by wednesday i didn't have

41:38.600 --> 41:39.600
internet

41:39.600 --> 41:40.760
until

41:40.760 --> 41:42.220
christmas day

41:42.220 --> 41:45.120
which didn't really matter anyway because

41:45.120 --> 41:47.720
i ended up being sick from

41:47.720 --> 41:49.280
christmas day till

41:49.280 --> 41:50.520
the tuesday

41:50.520 --> 41:54.520
that i had or not the tuesday i had to leave but you know the last day i was supposed to

41:54.520 --> 41:57.120
be at my folks so

41:57.120 --> 41:59.260
that kind of sucks

41:59.260 --> 42:02.880
i didn't have internet and then i got sick

42:02.880 --> 42:06.200
it was basically like a stress panic type deal

42:06.200 --> 42:08.040
cause it was like the first time

42:08.040 --> 42:09.120
i had been back

42:09.120 --> 42:14.500
uh... to my parents house since uh... i moved out so i don't know why

42:14.500 --> 42:18.160
it happened but i guess stress is kind of

42:18.160 --> 42:21.560
known to do that i guess and

42:21.560 --> 42:25.120
but christmas is good got some dvd's i wanted

42:25.120 --> 42:27.240
and uh... all that

42:27.240 --> 42:29.860
so i was happy about that

42:29.860 --> 42:33.640
and new years was spent

42:33.640 --> 42:35.000
or new years eve rather

42:35.000 --> 42:36.360
was spent just

42:36.360 --> 42:39.780
watching the tv until the fireworks went off and then

42:39.780 --> 42:42.720
the news station was kinda cool cuz

42:42.720 --> 42:45.660
you know four sets of fireworks going off at the same time so that was pretty

42:45.660 --> 42:46.780
interesting to watch

42:46.780 --> 42:49.260
and then i had a bloody mary for the first time

42:49.260 --> 42:53.180
yay angel drank oh my god

42:53.180 --> 42:56.980
actually no i cheated cuz i only had a third of that and then like a third of

42:56.980 --> 42:59.780
a glass of champagne and then i was just like duh

42:59.780 --> 43:02.500
and i still don't like champagne

43:02.500 --> 43:03.680
there's that

43:03.680 --> 43:04.560
and then

43:04.560 --> 43:10.680
I've been bad because I've been on a certain game for the past, let's see, wait, probably

43:10.680 --> 43:13.640
since Wednesday.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.000
Not as bad as the other two in here.

43:16.000 --> 43:20.040
Wait, I've been on the valve.

43:20.040 --> 43:21.040
Yeah well.

43:21.040 --> 43:24.040
I'm going to check my plans today.

43:24.040 --> 43:25.040
Uh oh.

43:25.040 --> 43:26.040
Jazz!

43:26.040 --> 43:33.280
Um, yeah, so, yeah, I've been playing that just a little too much, but it's okay, because

43:33.280 --> 43:37.520
It took me four months to get to that point, so you know what, just yay, alright?

43:37.520 --> 43:40.120
That's it.

43:40.120 --> 43:43.040
I'd just like to point out for the record that I have not been quite the addict, because

43:43.040 --> 43:47.160
I remember, I did sign on to Final Fantasy XI for a little bit this morning, and I got

43:47.160 --> 43:52.400
a message from DDR Angel, and suddenly I noticed, I'm like, dang, that girl's gained six levels

43:52.400 --> 43:55.280
since yesterday, how much has she been playing?

43:55.280 --> 43:59.840
Um, lots of PL, that's all I have to say.

43:59.840 --> 44:00.840
Alright, anyway.

44:00.840 --> 44:05.360
So, my week and my day, yeah, okay, a little bit of Final Fantasy XI, but not too bad.

44:05.360 --> 44:10.080
I did go out and do some stuff. I went to Iguana Girls New Year's Eve, bashed a little

44:10.080 --> 44:15.280
gathering of people there, and I learned how to play Texas Hold'em by watching celebrity

44:15.280 --> 44:20.440
poker, which I hadn't done before. But I love Kathy Griffin, oh my god, I love her, and

44:20.440 --> 44:23.680
even though she annoys the hell out of most people, I think she's so funny, and she was

44:23.680 --> 44:27.320
on the show, and she was the first person booted out that particular episode. Sorry

44:27.320 --> 44:28.320
Sorry to ruin it for you.

44:28.320 --> 44:32.100
She was the first person booted out that particular episode, but it was a good watch, and I learned

44:32.100 --> 44:33.100
how to play Texas Hold'em.

44:33.100 --> 44:36.940
So next time you guys have a poker night, it's on.

44:36.940 --> 44:37.940
It's on.

44:37.940 --> 44:45.900
Let's see, outside of that, New Year's Day, one of my buddies had his birthday, and he

44:45.900 --> 44:49.020
lives out in the middle of nowhere, California, basically.

44:49.020 --> 44:53.360
He lives about an hour's drive from here, and once you get about an hour out of Sacramento,

44:53.360 --> 44:55.620
this is why they call it Cowtown, okay?

44:55.620 --> 44:59.360
Unless you're going the hour towards the bay, that's about it.

44:59.360 --> 45:03.140
The other hours all around it is nothingness and there's really...

45:03.140 --> 45:08.240
It looked like the town out of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark, kinda.

45:08.240 --> 45:09.240
But it was cool.

45:09.240 --> 45:10.240
No, it was cool.

45:10.240 --> 45:11.240
We had a good time.

45:11.240 --> 45:12.740
And that was pretty much it.

45:12.740 --> 45:18.700
In Bimani-related news, gasp, gasp, in my life, for the past few days I have been playing

45:18.700 --> 45:24.200
workout mode in UltraMix 2, which I've actually been finding quite a lot of fun and I've been

45:24.200 --> 45:27.880
been playing for at least 20 minutes every day. Getting a little bit of exercise, trying

45:27.880 --> 45:31.340
to get some of my stamina back, because I figure if I play 20 minutes every day for

45:31.340 --> 45:39.900
a couple weeks, I'll be able to pass Katas back to back again, without having to stop.

45:39.900 --> 45:44.880
Which is how it's been lately. So, we'll see what happens. Other than that, that's pretty

45:44.880 --> 45:48.880
much it. Not a whole lot else for me to report that I can think of off the top of my head.

45:48.880 --> 45:52.780
I don't think so. Maybe later, so we go through the rest of the show. Alright, in fact, we're

45:52.780 --> 45:59.380
We're going to go to a break here, and when we come back from the break, we're going to

45:59.380 --> 46:06.920
talk about some new years news, and I want to talk about that other new music game that

46:06.920 --> 46:10.000
I finally have to take a look at today, even though it's been out for like three months.

46:10.000 --> 46:15.780
So we'll talk about that a little bit, and that'll be it when we come back.

46:15.780 --> 46:18.300
This break we're going to have some music.

46:18.300 --> 46:21.420
Some things that Jamie was saying there kind of inspired me a little bit, so I thought

46:21.420 --> 46:25.420
I thought we could do a break of music that makes Jamie angry.

46:25.420 --> 46:26.420
That makes me angry?

46:26.420 --> 46:27.420
Yes.

46:27.420 --> 46:28.420
Starting with the...

46:28.420 --> 46:29.420
Well, is it all voluntary?

46:29.420 --> 46:30.420
No.

46:30.420 --> 46:31.420
No.

46:31.420 --> 46:32.420
It's going to be the Safari to start it off.

46:32.420 --> 46:33.420
I like the...

46:33.420 --> 46:34.420
As long as you don't play the fast, crappy one.

46:34.420 --> 46:37.420
I actually like the song, but it pisses me off to play.

46:37.420 --> 46:38.420
Exactly.

46:38.420 --> 46:39.420
These are going to be songs that piss Jamie off to play.

46:39.420 --> 46:42.420
Although I did manage to stay about a 50% on it.

46:42.420 --> 46:43.420
Alright.

46:43.420 --> 46:44.420
Well, there you go.

46:44.420 --> 46:45.420
Alright, here we go.

46:45.420 --> 46:46.420
We'll be back after this.

51:46.420 --> 52:12.020
Hi, this is Melby of RTF, and for an extra $1.99 a minute, my girlfriend Melby can join

52:12.020 --> 52:14.020
us on all the fun together.

52:14.020 --> 52:21.020
Hey, hey, if you're a broke-ass like I am, why don't you come to the one place that costs absolutely nothing to go to and still the fun is just as great?

52:21.020 --> 52:28.020
It's Orange Lounge Radio, Sunday nights. Kick it with me and you just might realize the best things in life are free.

52:28.020 --> 52:34.020
Hello and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, our old buddy Mel there. I don't know when he's coming back for the show.

52:34.020 --> 52:36.020
That was at one of our very early shows.

52:36.020 --> 52:45.020
That, I believe, Mel came out for Episode 6, which was a long time ago.

52:45.020 --> 52:48.020
Back when I was still using the headset.

52:48.020 --> 52:50.020
Oh gosh, oh yes.

52:50.020 --> 52:53.020
That I acquired from Memories.

52:53.020 --> 52:59.020
We need to have an official nostalgia segment of the show, I think, because it comes up every week.

52:59.020 --> 53:01.020
Remember back when Orange Lounge was cool?

53:01.020 --> 53:03.020
Hey, we're always cool.

53:03.020 --> 53:05.020
I know, I'm just playing around.

53:05.020 --> 53:10.940
Let's see, what's going on this week? We had the big show we were doing here yesterday

53:10.940 --> 53:18.460
over on, you know, that other radio station, DDR Freak Radio, which is, no, it's fun, it

53:18.460 --> 53:22.340
was a good time, it's always fun to partner up with another station, kind of put your

53:22.340 --> 53:27.460
resources together to do something fun, and it was pretty cool to be a part of the first

53:27.460 --> 53:32.700
live show that DDR Freak had really done. Was it their, the first live show?

53:32.700 --> 53:39.120
There was a very, very brief, like 15 minute thing that I did that was just me being incredibly

53:39.120 --> 53:46.880
bored and experimental, and I did the whole radio DJ bit for a whopping season.

53:46.880 --> 53:50.360
You're listening to DDR music at the top of the hour?

53:50.360 --> 53:51.360
Exactly.

53:51.360 --> 53:52.360
Okay.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.360
Exactly.

53:53.360 --> 53:57.760
So I consider yesterday being the first DDR Freak Live special.

53:57.760 --> 54:00.360
The first horror show, basically.

54:00.360 --> 54:03.480
the one you got to whore out to the masses to get people to tune in.

54:03.480 --> 54:12.280
Because you know, I've done all of the other crap with the history of DDR and, you know, it's cool and all, but I want, you know, interaction.

54:12.280 --> 54:19.080
I want to be able to get the people involved and that's, you know, whenever we get the people involved, that's when we get the numbers.

54:19.080 --> 54:26.960
Absolutely, absolutely. So that was going on and a very interesting list. It was a top 14. It was originally going to be a top 10.

54:26.960 --> 54:30.660
Yeah, because not enough people got their butts out there and voted.

54:30.660 --> 54:36.880
To their credit, though, it was only a day, but still, more people could have done their

54:36.880 --> 54:37.880
part.

54:37.880 --> 54:39.100
But it's alright, it happens.

54:39.100 --> 54:42.700
It's the holidays, I guess.

54:42.700 --> 54:46.740
So it ended up, because of all the ties, there was a top 14 list they came up with.

54:46.740 --> 54:48.700
Now, we don't want to ruin it.

54:48.700 --> 54:51.740
A lot of you guys probably already figured it out for yourselves, maybe, if you know

54:51.740 --> 54:53.300
how to do that.

54:53.300 --> 54:55.940
Or some of you guys may have tuned in.

54:55.940 --> 54:59.700
But there are going to be replays coming up soon and those will be announced over on DDR

54:59.700 --> 55:01.020
Freak Radio.

55:01.020 --> 55:05.780
For you dial-up users, because I don't think it's going to show up on DDR Freak Lowband,

55:05.780 --> 55:06.780
right?

55:06.780 --> 55:07.780
No.

55:07.780 --> 55:08.780
No.

55:08.780 --> 55:09.780
Lowband is pretty much dying out.

55:09.780 --> 55:13.120
It will probably be disbanded after the year is up.

55:13.120 --> 55:14.620
Very few dial-up users anymore, though.

55:14.620 --> 55:15.620
Very, very few.

55:15.620 --> 55:16.620
Very few.

55:16.620 --> 55:21.340
We don't have plans to ditch the dial-up friendly stream anytime soon just because of the fact

55:21.340 --> 55:24.860
that since we're MP3 Pro, we can stay a pretty good quality.

55:24.860 --> 55:29.220
And again, if you guys don't know what MP3 Pro is, and we're not sounding like FM quality

55:29.220 --> 55:31.580
to you, then you're missing the MP3 Pro codec.

55:31.580 --> 55:35.660
And if you want to just get more information on that, go to www.orangeonsready.com and

55:35.660 --> 55:39.980
click on the FAQ, and that'll give you all the information on the MP3 Pro codec.

55:39.980 --> 55:43.940
And if, like, if you're listening to us in your iTunes player right now, iTunes does

55:43.940 --> 55:45.500
not have MP3 Pro codec.

55:45.500 --> 55:48.840
So there's actually a much clearer version of the stream available.

55:48.840 --> 55:50.080
All the information's over there.

55:50.080 --> 55:51.080
Check it out.

55:51.080 --> 55:52.080
But again, you don't have to do it.

55:52.080 --> 55:56.140
just, you know, make things a little clearer. But I think for the foreseeable future we're

55:56.140 --> 56:00.120
going to stay dial-up friendly, because I know we still have a few of those. Very few,

56:00.120 --> 56:07.680
but a few. And I want to say that the DDR Freak Top 10 Countdown we will broadcast for

56:07.680 --> 56:14.100
our dial-up users, and for those that want to catch it, one time, and that's Tuesday

56:14.100 --> 56:18.920
night, as part of Pump Up The Volume. So you have to tune into Jamie's show, because she'll

56:18.920 --> 56:20.520
play the Top 10 show as part of her show.

56:20.520 --> 56:21.960
And if you don't, I'll kick your butt.

56:21.960 --> 56:25.480
Exactly. Same rule as always, tune in or she'll kick your butt.

56:29.800 --> 56:33.240
What did you think of the list that ended up though? Were you kind of surprised with it?

56:35.560 --> 56:41.000
I'm not incredibly surprised. I'm surprised at how many songs from how many different mixes

56:41.720 --> 56:47.080
got in there, which, you know, pleasant surprise on that front, but I'm really going to fucking

56:47.080 --> 56:50.640
kill Dawn. I'm killing frequency, that's all there is to it.

56:50.640 --> 56:54.100
Okay. Um, Dynamite Rave should not have been in that list

56:54.100 --> 56:56.920
at all, thank you very much.

56:56.920 --> 57:01.040
And let alone people voting for Dynamite Rave.

57:01.040 --> 57:06.400
Good God. That's true, because not only did it have to get nominated, but it had to get voted on.

57:06.400 --> 57:10.880
But, we're not stupid. We know that folks have their little cliques out there,

57:10.880 --> 57:13.920
because, you know, hell, I had my friends voting for Skulk. I mean, what can you...

57:13.920 --> 57:19.920
Yeah, but there were other people voting for Skull too, so that's why it made it in there.

57:19.920 --> 57:27.920
But, you know, overall, I was pretty pleased to see some of the stuff that ended up on the list.

57:27.920 --> 57:31.920
You know, I'm glad, I was very happy to see a lot of 2DX representation.

57:31.920 --> 57:40.920
A lot of 2DX representation. My biggest surprise was the fact that I think on the whole list there was only two songs that were actually new in 2004.

57:40.920 --> 57:44.320
I think, off the top of my head. Maybe

57:44.320 --> 57:47.560
there's another couple... Not enough love for the US original stuff.

57:47.560 --> 57:52.060
No, and that kind of surprised me, because I thought... I realize that some people have

57:52.060 --> 57:55.240
issues with the US mixes and the way that they've been presented.

57:55.240 --> 57:59.440
For example, Xtreme, people bitch about the interface, although...

57:59.440 --> 58:03.280
They bitch about everything. Seriously, they bitch about everything, but the biggest bitch being the

58:03.280 --> 58:04.540
interface, although,

58:04.540 --> 58:09.960
you know, it's not that bad. But most people are okay with the songs.

58:09.960 --> 58:11.960
You know, I hear a few bitches here and they're like,

58:11.960 --> 58:13.960
Ehh, why is YMCA in there? That song's gay.

58:13.960 --> 58:18.960
But usually, people seem to enjoy the U.S. exclusive songs, especially Max 2.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.960
I think nobody can really complain about Max 2.

58:20.960 --> 58:21.960
It was great music.

58:21.960 --> 58:22.960
Yeah, it was.

58:22.960 --> 58:28.960
All of the Max 2 stuff, even some of the Max stuff, it was just great.

58:28.960 --> 58:31.960
But, oh well.

58:31.960 --> 58:34.960
Yeah, don't go there.

58:34.960 --> 58:38.960
He was making reference to a deep black forest.

58:38.960 --> 58:40.960
Hey, I like dark black forest

58:41.480 --> 58:43.960
See, I don't even know what it's called because all I can call it

58:44.760 --> 58:52.100
See now I have to explain the story good in the beginning where he says into the dark black forest or whatever it is

58:52.100 --> 58:56.680
All right. I'm afraid it's where we going. It sounds like the start of a porno

58:57.440 --> 59:01.000
So I always hear big black cock

59:01.000 --> 59:07.000
You know what's funny? I think that was a running gag on this show for a while, too.

59:07.000 --> 59:10.000
It was, thanks to, um, Darkstown.

59:10.000 --> 59:15.000
That was Darkstown. Hold on, hold on, let me, for those who don't know what the hell Iguana Girl's talking about, here is a little clip, okay?

59:15.000 --> 59:21.000
It's a long way to go, honey.

59:21.000 --> 59:26.000
I know, but I'm afraid. Where are we going?

59:26.000 --> 59:33.000
into the dark black forest.

59:33.200 --> 59:37.360
Alright, you need to get it. It just sounds like the start of a porno, I don't know.

59:37.360 --> 59:42.760
Maybe it should be, I don't know. I'm afraid, where are we going? Shut up and take your clothes off, bitch!

59:42.760 --> 59:48.560
I'm paid to cash up front, now take it off!

59:48.560 --> 59:53.560
Well...

59:53.560 --> 59:58.560
And Dark Black Forest could be a euphemism for something if you think about it.

59:58.560 --> 01:00:00.560
You know what? We don't need to go there.

01:00:00.560 --> 01:00:03.560
Someone who isn't very well kept.

01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.560
We've had the C-bomb once.

01:00:07.560 --> 01:00:09.560
Hey, I...

01:00:09.560 --> 01:00:13.560
Both boys and girls can have this issue, okay?

01:00:13.560 --> 01:00:15.560
Shaved ears, please.

01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:18.560
We're Europeans.

01:00:18.560 --> 01:00:23.560
Anyway, wow. Leave it to this show to go straight to the toilet.

01:00:23.560 --> 01:00:25.560
Thankfully that song was not on the countdown.

01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:30.560
Yeah, because heaven forbid that subject came up yesterday.

01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:38.560
So, I guess I have to, this would be a good time to ask this question because

01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:44.560
you know, DDR Freak, although I don't like to just sit here and talk about DDR Freak.

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:45.560
Neither do I.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:50.120
So let's face it though, hon, it's a big part of the community and anybody that listens

01:00:50.120 --> 01:00:55.320
to this show knows what DDR Freak is, they may not post everything.

01:00:55.320 --> 01:01:00.560
So DDR Freak is kind of family friendly, right, and a lot of people get frustrated because

01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:04.720
they can't type shit and fuck, it gets censored, although some of the censored stuff is really

01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:05.720
funny.

01:01:05.720 --> 01:01:08.200
I personally like doggy, that's just me.

01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:09.200
I like...

01:01:09.200 --> 01:01:10.200
I like poopy.

01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:11.200
I like cigarette.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:17.680
best was, before when they first tried to start it, ass turned into butt. So someone

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.680
would try to type Massachusetts and type M-A-S-S and it turned into M-butt.

01:01:21.680 --> 01:01:35.480
Now it's just buttocks. So, M-buttocks-chucets? I don't know. Anyway,

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:40.720
so is there a lot of youngins on DER Freak or is this, you just want to keep a G rating

01:01:40.720 --> 01:01:46.720
We're trying to keep it as G-rated as possible just for the overall audience.

01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.720
We get quite a few mentions on all of the different mixes that are coming out.

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:56.720
And one of the first places that people are going to go when they look up DDR is going to be DDR Freaks.

01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:03.720
So we have to kind of try to keep that family-friendly vibe going so that somebody's 13-year-old kid

01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:05.720
is going to be coming on there and their parents are going,

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:10.500
going oh my god is that the word fuck on your screen you know and freaking out or

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:15.800
something obviously there's ways around the filters and if you know if you're

01:02:15.800 --> 01:02:20.000
smart enough you can kind of just ask anybody ask any of the ops in our chat

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.360
room they know how to do it quote somebody's post you know be able to see

01:02:23.360 --> 01:02:33.120
it oh wait I give away a secret oh but yeah we we don't really we don't really

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:35.120
I actually... I openly advertise that.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:37.120
See, I...

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.120
Well, that's okay. Nobody listens to this show.

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:44.120
I feel kind of bad because I dropped the F-bomb on yesterday's show.

01:02:44.120 --> 01:02:47.120
Kind of forgetting that whole family-friendly vibe.

01:02:47.120 --> 01:02:48.120
You know, honestly...

01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:51.120
At least I didn't say what Loki said earlier.

01:02:53.120 --> 01:02:55.120
I'm not too concerned about it.

01:02:56.120 --> 01:02:57.120
It's no big deal.

01:02:57.120 --> 01:03:00.120
I was the one sitting there making AIDS jokes, so...

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:05.240
If there's nothing, you know, less family-friendly, less family-friendly than the internet.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:07.120
Or politically correct, really.

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:08.120
Yes.

01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:09.120
Yes.

01:03:09.120 --> 01:03:10.120
All right.

01:03:10.120 --> 01:03:11.120
All right.

01:03:11.120 --> 01:03:14.280
I just had to ask about the, you know, family thing, because I think, I think some people

01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:15.280
out there...

01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.420
Okay, even, here's the catch-22 that we have.

01:03:18.420 --> 01:03:22.720
We have specifically, when you sign up for the site, when you sign up for the forums,

01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:29.660
it asks you, it says, I am over the age of 13, and you cannot agree to that unless you're

01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:35.980
over the age of 13, or you're lying. So unfortunately we do have, you know, 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:39.660
I was going to say, how old is the youngest poster though? Because I...

01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:44.380
We've got like, you know, we've got like DDRbot. Yeah, wow. And isn't DDRbot like 10 or something?

01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:52.180
I think so, I think so. Yeah. So the youngest I think is probably around 9 or 10. And it's

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:58.300
not, we usually don't cause problems about it unless they're causing issues. And it's

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:04.880
just a matter of maturity, typically. So I've met a lot of 16-year-olds that were less

01:04:04.880 --> 01:04:09.740
mature than the 9-year-olds. Yeah, me too. And I've dropped the f-bomb quite a lot on

01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:16.020
DDR Freak on the boards, but you know, you just... They're gonna learn it sometimes.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:20.480
It's the way you say it. Yeah. Sometimes it's not what you're saying, it's the way you say

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:27.320
it, you know? And I can say, because I am an instructor of customer service, and I can

01:04:27.320 --> 01:04:30.400
tell you kids, if you ever go out and get a customer service job, your instructor's

01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:31.480
going to tell you the same thing.

01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:32.480
Respond.

01:04:32.480 --> 01:04:33.480
Don't react.

01:04:33.480 --> 01:04:34.480
Exactly.

01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:36.300
It's not about what you say.

01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:39.600
What you say is only 10% of how the information is perceived.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:43.320
And by the way, 35% of statistics are made up on the spot.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:44.320
But...

01:04:44.320 --> 01:04:45.320
I thought it was 43.

01:04:45.320 --> 01:04:46.560
Whatever.

01:04:46.560 --> 01:04:48.360
But it's how you say it, kids.

01:04:48.360 --> 01:04:51.680
You know, I really don't give a crap about your problem, but let's tell you what we can

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:54.320
do to just BS our way through it.

01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:55.320
Exactly.

01:04:55.320 --> 01:04:58.840
When Darksecker said that it had a nice, friendly atmosphere to it, you know?

01:04:58.840 --> 01:05:01.640
Who's been doing customer service for too damn long?

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.840
As I raise my hand?

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:11.960
Ironic enough, I just went through a stupid class in school doing that exact same shit.

01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:14.360
Oh my god, I hated it.

01:05:14.360 --> 01:05:17.720
All that just for one stinking little piece of paper.

01:05:17.720 --> 01:05:23.160
Well, that piece of stinking paper is going to turn into a big wad of cash someday.

01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:23.960
Just got to remember that.

01:05:23.960 --> 01:05:24.600
We'll see.

01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:34.320
I'll take the spotlight off of Drill DDR Freak for right now.

01:05:34.320 --> 01:05:39.720
But speaking of DDR Freak, for whatever reason, despite the kid-friendly and family-friendly

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.840
atmosphere, they do rebroadcast this very show, Friday nights at 6 o'clock.

01:05:43.840 --> 01:05:45.880
So tune into that, definitely.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.800
I'm sure with the hefty disclaimer.

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:51.120
Just the standard disclaimers that...

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.060
We have a disclaimer right in the intro to the show.

01:05:54.060 --> 01:05:58.920
does say there may be a scene of nudity in this program and there may be this

01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:05.700
this program contains naughty language well shit so it's not my fault if you

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:10.600
tuned in halfway through you should have been here on time it's not like I

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.200
started it a different time every single that's right that's right we're here

01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:18.960
whether you are or not and believe me we've done this show when nobody was

01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:26.220
here all right but anyway I actually speaking of nobody being here I happen

01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:29.460
to know that a lot of folks weren't here for last week's show I know because I

01:06:29.460 --> 01:06:34.820
got the ratings okay people so this Friday on DDR freak great chance for you

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:38.180
guys to catch that episode if you missed it so Friday six o'clock all I'm gonna

01:06:38.180 --> 01:06:43.580
say I don't want to ruin what went on but we had our own DDR freak the movie

01:06:43.580 --> 01:06:50.660
parody thing going on priceless you got to hear it man that's a subject that

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:54.860
hasn't been heard of for years oh we just took that subject and ran away with

01:06:54.860 --> 01:06:58.820
it though I know I know that that it's an it's old news but somehow it got

01:06:58.820 --> 01:07:02.420
brought up last week and we just ran away with it on a random side note that

01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:07.560
I just remembered again Rob yes we've been playing DDR for four years now

01:07:07.560 --> 01:07:12.380
that's true oh my gosh this is our official four year anniversary of DDR

01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:19.380
Yeah, actually last Sunday. Not today, but the first day we went to play DDR was sometime between Christmas and New Year's.

01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:25.380
I played for the first time, well not for the first first time, but, you know, for first regular. Like our first regular session was.

01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:35.380
Yeah, that was on the 26th. A little known fact, Iguana Girl and I played our first game, well actually no, most people that listen to this show know that now, because I know it's not the first time it's come up, but we played our first game of DDR together in Vegas.

01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:41.440
October 2000. October 2000 and then we didn't play regularly until

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:46.220
one of us spotted the machine at golf. Was it me? You did it, you saw it, you played it,

01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:50.300
and then I was jealous because I couldn't play it until the day after Christmas.

01:07:50.300 --> 01:07:53.900
That's right. You know what, I remember now.

01:07:53.900 --> 01:07:57.700
My memory is being jogged. I went down there because... You went there on Christmas Eve.

01:07:57.700 --> 01:08:02.820
I went there to go play pinball or something. Yeah. So I was all pissed off because you had two more days than me.

01:08:02.820 --> 01:08:07.140
me and that's what I kept it you know the reason why you were so much better

01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:11.540
yes and amazingly amazingly enough suddenly I was passing nine-footers on

01:08:11.540 --> 01:08:16.620
the third day and just left a guana girl in the dust go figure out not quite not

01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:20.820
quite boys and girls it took me a long time to pass a knife long time has

01:08:20.820 --> 01:08:25.860
nine-footer I remember a certain expedition to a certain golf land and a

01:08:25.860 --> 01:08:32.300
certain Milpitas and the islander machine I remember the first time I met

01:08:32.300 --> 01:08:42.500
Islander was at Fana made 2001 when I was cosplaying Emmy no it was before

01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:46.500
that but I mean the first February February right right because of the

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:52.500
Milpitas trip right but does the second time then was at Fana me yeah and I was

01:08:52.500 --> 01:08:56.660
sort of a little standoffish because of the shirt he was wearing a flip shirt

01:08:56.660 --> 01:09:06.660
It was something to wear. It was just something I didn't have. At the time I was collecting just random shirts.

01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:10.660
Look boys and girls, what you don't know is he went home later and changed the oil with it, okay?

01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:16.660
I also remember that that's when I met a bunch of people in the community was at that particular convention.

01:09:16.660 --> 01:09:18.660
That was a great convention. It really was.

01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:22.940
was I remember sitting on the floor after two days of sleep deprivation and

01:09:22.940 --> 01:09:29.260
then Wendell sits next to me after two days of drinking actually he was drunk I

01:09:29.260 --> 01:09:32.420
was sleep deprived so we were both in about the same frame of mind and going

01:09:32.420 --> 01:09:38.020
having an interesting conversation and then he fell asleep I was actually in

01:09:38.020 --> 01:09:40.860
the arcade room and I fell asleep on the chair that was right next to the DDR

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:44.940
machine oh yeah absolutely and so like I was sitting there and people were

01:09:44.940 --> 01:09:49.380
walking up and they're like looking at me going oh man this guy's not doing his

01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:59.540
job and I'm like what my first eat my first EDR machine that was the year

01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:06.120
before that on a May Expo 2000 they had the third mix there and I was like why

01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:12.940
are the arrows cap colors because I started playing with the first one on

01:10:12.940 --> 01:10:17.620
PlayStation 98 and then I the only one I had ever owned was my second mix on

01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:24.300
Dreamcast. The first mix Jess and I ever played was a 1-5 right? I remember playing

01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:27.260
Butterfly. Yeah we played Butterfly and we played Boom Boom Dollar. Yeah I remember

01:10:27.260 --> 01:10:32.800
that but it didn't phase me when we when we moved up to USA because like that was

01:10:32.800 --> 01:10:36.180
the next machine we'd played so I it never occurred to me that oh the first

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.980
time we played this didn't look all pretty like this you know just I all I

01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:45.480
The first thing I noticed was, wow, there's so many songs in this, which is ironic considering

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:50.280
it was DDR USA mix, and I'm sitting there going, oh my god, this has a ton of songs.

01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:51.280
What's this Boyz song?

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:52.280
This song's great.

01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.920
Oh god, you heard that out.

01:10:53.920 --> 01:10:56.920
Oh my god, you heard that out.

01:10:56.920 --> 01:10:58.200
I was so tired of hearing that song.

01:10:58.200 --> 01:11:02.880
I hoard Boyz by Smile DK on DDR USA.

01:11:02.880 --> 01:11:06.600
And it pissed me off because when we were first starting out, it was hard for me.

01:11:06.600 --> 01:11:10.600
I was having a hard time doing that on basic, you know?

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:15.600
It's like, it's kind of frustrating, you know, thinking back on it,

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:18.600
but yeah, I was pissed off at the fact that you kept doing boys

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600
because I was like, you're going to kill me!

01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:24.600
But I love Boys, the song.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:27.600
Yeah, sure, the song.

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.600
But then again, I forced you through 20 November about 5 billion times, too.

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:33.600
I remember 20 November-a-thons, yes I do.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:34.600
Yeah. Good times.

01:11:34.600 --> 01:11:43.600
And our massive attempts at trying to take on the board, the high score board, because

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:48.600
back then, that was when Konami was doing their net ranking, right?

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:58.600
And back then, you could score the same on a basic song as you could on a maniac song.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:02.720
it was it was something like that no I think it was 45 I think what it was

01:12:02.720 --> 01:12:08.000
million is that you honestly there weren't that many people playing DDR yet

01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.760
yeah so there wasn't that many people on the scoreboards and we were kind of like

01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.400
wow if we could full combo that's it it didn't have to anything to do with

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.120
perfect grace or anything your score was full combo if you could full combo your

01:12:20.120 --> 01:12:24.280
way through a bunch of songs you would be in good shape a couple times that I

01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:28.480
had to do EOTC five times in a row I remember that we were trying to rank

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:31.480
Like, didn't we end up in the top twenty or something?

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:32.480
We were in the top five.

01:12:33.480 --> 01:12:34.480
What? Were we really?

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:35.480
We were in the top five.

01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:36.480
Were we?

01:12:36.480 --> 01:12:37.480
Well, not-

01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:38.480
No, I thought you meant overall in the U.S.

01:12:38.480 --> 01:12:40.480
Yeah, no, no, no. I'm talking on just the machine.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.480
Oh yeah, I remember the machine we ended up in the top five.

01:12:42.480 --> 01:12:43.480
Yeah.

01:12:43.480 --> 01:12:46.480
Because I remember on doubles, uh, Dark Sakura,

01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:48.480
and this is when we first really were getting to know each other,

01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:50.480
Dark Sakura and I had a friendly little competition going

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:53.480
where her and I were kind of battling each other on the doubles board.

01:12:53.480 --> 01:12:55.480
We had the sandwich.

01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:56.480
Yes, we had the sandwich for a while.

01:12:56.480 --> 01:13:03.240
for a while. Who was it? Uh, Lanky Style. Lanky Style. No, it was Brad Sandwich. I worked

01:13:03.240 --> 01:13:07.840
my ass off to get first place on that damn machine. I remember. Jamie was the buns, because

01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:12.280
she was first and last. I was first and last. And Brad, Lanky Style, on Thursday Night's

01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:17.760
Program, was the meat, because he was in the middle, he was third, and I was the fruit,

01:13:17.760 --> 01:13:21.680
second and fourth. You know how I got first place? How? I ended up getting first place

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:27.440
by doing Dynamite Rave doubles, basic, and full convo-ing it.

01:13:27.440 --> 01:13:30.360
Oh I see, you were one of those ones that hoarded Dynamite Rave in the beginning.

01:13:30.360 --> 01:13:33.400
I was one of the ones that hoarded Dynamite Rave, but then again, I was very proud because

01:13:33.400 --> 01:13:35.680
Dynamite Rave was the first 5 footer I could do in doubles.

01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:38.040
That's alright, you know what song I used to do it?

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:39.720
Love to me.

01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:40.720
Oooooooh.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:50.280
Alright, Nostalgia City, remember when all the cool kids were doing that?

01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.520
I was never a cool kid.

01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:57.640
You never did that? Not even once? I'm too fat to do that.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:01.920
I'm serious. I would have fallen over if I tried to do that. I seem to remember that you did some

01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:05.640
kind of white girl freestyle. Yeah, I was doing a white girl freestyle that didn't require me to

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:07.960
actually have to hit the pad with my hands.

01:14:07.960 --> 01:14:12.440
I mean, I... well, alright. When you get down there, it's hard to bring yourself back up.

01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:15.800
It's hard to bring yourself back up, yeah. It's one thing to fall. And you gotta keep in mind that

01:14:15.800 --> 01:14:18.520
when I first started I was 270.

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:23.960
So it took me quite a long time to lose my initial 30 pounds, and that, you know, unfortunately

01:14:23.960 --> 01:14:26.240
I gained more than that back.

01:14:26.240 --> 01:14:29.560
But I've lost it again, so it doesn't matter.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.080
We're clean slate now.

01:14:31.080 --> 01:14:32.080
Yeah.

01:14:32.080 --> 01:14:33.080
Yeah.

01:14:33.080 --> 01:14:34.080
All right.

01:14:34.080 --> 01:14:38.480
But for those of you guys that weren't, you know, you've only been playing DDR since like

01:14:38.480 --> 01:14:43.360
fourth, max, whatever, and you kind of missed out on those USA days, if you want to see

01:14:43.360 --> 01:14:48.120
what we're talking about, go to DDR Freak, look at the step chart for Love to Me Basic,

01:14:48.120 --> 01:14:52.220
you'll see several portions of the song left right jump right you have left

01:14:52.220 --> 01:14:57.540
right jumps and then down up in quarter notes right so the jump on left right

01:14:57.540 --> 01:15:04.100
uh-huh and then hand backward hand plant backwards and then go forwards are you

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:07.140
are you demonstrating on cam even though it's only updates every 30 seconds

01:15:07.140 --> 01:15:10.380
that's right I have a girl demonstrate in super slow

01:15:10.380 --> 01:15:28.140
motion for these guys on cam. Hopefully we'll see something on cam. Sometimes I wish we

01:15:28.140 --> 01:15:37.640
were a TV show, I really do. So that we could get booed by the Nilsons? Please, our ratings

01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:43.200
couldn't be any worse than g4 tech TV come on oh my god when you're when

01:15:43.200 --> 01:15:48.400
you're getting beat by the Golf Channel okay something's wrong you know tech TV

01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:54.840
came up a conversation over lunch today how so the Soul Caliber dates Soul

01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:58.280
Caliber dates they Dan was telling me about something they had on tech TV

01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:02.320
where they had someone going on a blind date with Cervantes from Soul Caliber

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.920
What are you going to have for dinner?

01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.520
I WANT YOUR SOUL!

01:16:07.520 --> 01:16:13.040
We never had tech TV, it was G4 and then G4 basically assimilated tech TV.

01:16:13.040 --> 01:16:14.040
This was G4 tech TV.

01:16:14.040 --> 01:16:16.040
I didn't see it.

01:16:16.040 --> 01:16:21.160
Alright, well you know what, if any G4 tech TV people are listening, as much as we give

01:16:21.160 --> 01:16:28.040
you guys shit, we would sell our souls to you in a minute, so uh, call me.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.040
Moving on.

01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:30.040
I think now's a good time.

01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:32.040
On that note, let's go to a break.

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:38.280
Alright, when we come back from break, I know Loki is dying over there to give a sim update.

01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:42.860
We still want to talk about that other game, and we also want to get to the cage match.

01:16:42.860 --> 01:16:44.620
We gotta do the cage match.

01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:46.700
It's just not Orange on the Radio show without the cage match.

01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:51.060
And for those of you guys that missed last week, you missed a real shocker in the cage

01:16:51.060 --> 01:16:52.060
match.

01:16:52.060 --> 01:16:55.540
And we'll explain what's going on there when we come back from this break.

01:16:55.540 --> 01:17:01.140
And I figured maybe in this break, we could do some music that would remind us of the

01:17:01.140 --> 01:17:10.500
good old days. So, let's start it off with... I'm looking, I'm looking to see if I can find

01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:15.380
it. I think it's this one. We'll be right back after this, boys and girls. And everybody,

01:17:15.380 --> 01:17:19.720
when you hear this song, practice. Get up off your chair and practice the move that

01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:26.720
Islander was just showing you will be back

01:17:49.720 --> 01:17:56.720
I need you more, never lose your way Only in my dreams, when I see you, they say

01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:05.720
I'll come back to me If you see that you love me, look, I'm talking

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:12.720
You give me a helping, all I can say I love what you're feeling, I love what you're dreaming

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:15.840
No one can bring me on to where I am

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.440
You've been young, baby, so close, yeah, close, yeah

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:23.200
So many, so many, who's here, who's here

01:18:23.200 --> 01:18:26.720
Leave me on the high street, high street, high street

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.640
Let me be

01:18:28.640 --> 01:18:34.000
So far out, I've been reduced to hope before you wade away

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.120
I need you now, metal is the way

01:18:37.120 --> 01:18:42.320
Only in my dreams, when I see you looking, they all come back to me

01:18:42.320 --> 01:18:46.320
This is so clear, so many good ears

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:49.320
We must go home dear, careful just to see ya

01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:52.320
See you on my side, see the cow hide

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:56.320
Don't want to wait for the baby, watch the river

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:05.320
Dreamin', dreamin', groovin'

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.320
If you know what I mean, it's spookin' on the scene, alright

01:19:09.320 --> 01:19:13.400
Make them come in, take the winin', make them movin' up with the Dancer King

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:19.240
What are they gonna do, what are they thinkin'?

01:19:19.280 --> 01:19:21.280
Drip, drip, drip, drip, drip, drip on skank

01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:23.020
Grind a yo's and up in the vine

01:19:23.020 --> 01:19:25.020
To top around if your body have size

01:19:25.020 --> 01:19:27.020
Now we have the size and shape and stamina

01:19:27.020 --> 01:19:30.020
To make the party cool, the bubble and wine

01:19:30.020 --> 01:19:31.020
Ratch it on my boy

01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.720
Make them come in, take the winin', make them movin' up with the Dancer King

01:19:36.720 --> 01:19:38.480
Until you diss, until you dance

01:20:38.480 --> 01:21:02.480
This morning I open my eyes and everything is still the same

01:21:02.480 --> 01:21:06.480
I turned to the guy who was gay last night

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:11.480
I'm asking, what's your name?

01:21:11.480 --> 01:21:14.480
She used to touch me more and more

01:21:14.480 --> 01:21:18.480
I love those men one and all

01:21:18.480 --> 01:21:22.480
Each new one of me makes my heart beat fast

01:21:22.480 --> 01:21:25.480
When I see them so strong and tall

01:21:55.480 --> 01:22:02.480
With apologies to Iguana Girl, I can't resist this next one.

01:22:25.480 --> 01:22:28.920
Boys, boys, be my boy, and that I'm ready, honey

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:33.080
Boys, boys, be my boy, I wanna be your lover, girl

01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.880
Be my lover, boy

01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:38.920
I've done my job, always thought that I'm a man

01:22:39.560 --> 01:22:41.960
I've got a magic in me, yeah

01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:45.960
I'm all around, still we're family paradise

01:22:46.520 --> 01:22:49.000
We cry to be the kids everywhere

01:22:50.040 --> 01:22:52.760
I'm just a girl, the clock has locked us all

01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:56.760
It's time to get something hot So come on, let's get hot

01:22:56.760 --> 01:22:59.760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna feel your body

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.760
But, boy, be my boy Tonight I'm ready, honey

01:23:03.760 --> 01:23:07.760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna be your lover, girl

01:23:07.760 --> 01:23:10.760
Be my lover, boy

01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:20.760
But, boy, be my boy I wanna feel your body

01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:23.260
Honey, bud, bud, be my boy.

01:23:23.260 --> 01:23:26.740
Tonight I'm ready, honey, bud, bud, be my boy.

01:23:26.740 --> 01:23:29.740
I'm gonna be your lover, girl.

01:23:29.740 --> 01:23:31.240
Be my lover, boy.

01:23:39.720 --> 01:23:43.720
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

01:23:43.720 --> 01:23:45.180
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:23:45.180 --> 01:23:58.180
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Sorry, Jess, I just couldn't resist. But it's been like a good, like, what, four, three, four years since you heard it last, maybe?

01:23:58.180 --> 01:24:05.180
Come on, so many memories, so little time. How can I choose?

01:24:05.180 --> 01:24:08.180
That's still the sluttiest song ever.

01:24:08.180 --> 01:24:13.140
I'm being told F you in the chatroom. Thank you. Hey, we'll get to the F. He's a week a little later. All right

01:24:18.060 --> 01:24:20.800
She's not I'm I'm sorry

01:24:21.660 --> 01:24:23.660
I'm sorry. I

01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:26.080
Sorry, I will we follow you

01:24:26.080 --> 01:24:31.080
She's typing messages. Oh, she says I'm not cute.

01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:44.080
She's only typing at me through text now.

01:24:46.080 --> 01:24:51.080
Oh, she's not even typing at me anymore. Forget it.

01:24:51.080 --> 01:24:55.520
going to move on with the show here. I'm actually waiting, I'm kind of hoping to hear from somebody

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:59.680
on the Skype line in a couple minutes here. I open it up for a particular person to get

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:06.140
through, which I'm hoping to hear from in just a second here. In the meantime, I thought

01:25:06.140 --> 01:25:11.940
maybe we would kind of start moving into the sim update for this week. I know Loki's got

01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:15.180
a lot he wants to say for the sim update, so I'll let him get started, but just keep

01:25:15.180 --> 01:25:18.020
in mind I might have to pick up a call midway through, sorry.

01:25:18.020 --> 01:25:20.020
Thanks.

01:25:20.020 --> 01:25:23.460
Glad I'm, you know, top priority there.

01:25:23.460 --> 01:25:29.540
Anyways, um, yeah, this week there's a few things as opposed to the normal nothing.

01:25:29.540 --> 01:25:34.300
Um, DDRUK still new, um, no new sim files.

01:25:34.300 --> 01:25:39.020
They're still waiting on beginner steps for, um, the Ultramix 2 stuff.

01:25:39.020 --> 01:25:41.500
But it's close to being done, so that's good.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:50.500
Um, other than that, um, there's also a little theme that just got released on, uh, Bamai Cell right now, only because DDR Mania X is down,

01:25:50.500 --> 01:26:00.500
and that theme would be Techno-Fiend 3. That's right, the most kick-ass skin ever for Step Mania has now released its final version of it, and, uh, it's awesome.

01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:06.500
Now, I don't even play Step Mania, really, and I know what Techno-Fiend is, okay? It's that good.

01:26:06.500 --> 01:26:11.660
good. Like, I really think the skin is great. I think it just, whoever did the work on that,

01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:12.660
kudos to you.

01:26:12.660 --> 01:26:17.740
It is the sexiest skin out there, and you gotta check it out. It's just, it's really

01:26:17.740 --> 01:26:23.180
awesome. Lots of humor and a little Easter eggster in the background there. But, um,

01:26:23.180 --> 01:26:28.660
it's just, it's really nice looking. They've added, um, it's just completely redone almost,

01:26:28.660 --> 01:26:35.140
and I don't know how to describe it. It's just very well put together, very, um, optimized,

01:26:35.140 --> 01:26:42.140
and just runs really well. But yeah, you'll have to go check it out. It's kind of hard

01:26:42.140 --> 01:26:46.860
to find right now, only because, you know, DDR Maniacs is down. So what you need to do

01:26:46.860 --> 01:26:54.340
is go to BamaiCell, go to their DDR sim file section there, and just do a search for Technofeen.

01:26:54.340 --> 01:26:58.500
You'll find it probably, it's actually on the second or third page on there right now,

01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:04.660
and you should find it to download it and it's awesome. It's a good 14 megs but um...

01:27:04.660 --> 01:27:07.920
it is a really good sim... um... skin.

01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.580
Um... other than that

01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:10.860
uh... there's also

01:27:10.860 --> 01:27:13.060
what was it the um...

01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:17.540
OSC3 Plus Remix which is um...

01:27:17.540 --> 01:27:20.820
the Stepfile contest where they had all the you know

01:27:20.820 --> 01:27:25.260
basically songs where they're taking new steps or they're being remixed or whatever.

01:27:25.260 --> 01:27:43.260
That's available for download also on BamaiStyle, and they also have their own download pack that's available right now, which is, I think, a couple more sim files, and it's, uh, DDR5 Key Classics is the, um, theme for this one, so check those out over there as well.

01:27:44.260 --> 01:27:45.260
And that's all.

01:27:46.260 --> 01:27:53.260
Okay, for those that don't really know what Technofeam is all about, what exactly makes this skin so damn cool?

01:27:53.260 --> 01:28:07.260
It's just sexy, that's all it is. It's just very, you know, the interface is very well done and it just doesn't look like DDR. It looks really cool. I can't really describe it, you just have to go download it and check it out.

01:28:07.260 --> 01:28:26.260
It's kind of like, I want to say Star Wars because it has a lot of Star Wars parodies in it, but not really. I mean, it's just very different. It makes DDR all futuristic. It makes it feel like a 2010 game or something, you know. It just gives it a very futuristic theme to it. That would be the way I would put it. And it's sexy.

01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:45.260
Yes, that'd probably be a way. It looks like what a new, if they were to reinvent DDR and release it now, what it would look like. Well, maybe not. Because, you know, if they were to, you know, spend the amount of time that they did on, like, finding good music with designing the interface, this is what it'd look like.

01:28:46.260 --> 01:28:49.260
Alright. Any comments from anybody else about Techno-Fiend? I know-

01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:51.260
It was purdy.

01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.260
You saw a little bit of it?

01:28:52.260 --> 01:28:53.260
It was purdy.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:54.260
Yeah, very pretty.

01:28:54.260 --> 01:28:55.760
very pretty

01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:56.620
and it

01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.260
jazz felt excited

01:28:58.260 --> 01:29:00.260
you've used this technofeen before yes

01:29:00.260 --> 01:29:05.740
not yet the first time i've seen it but i'm definitely going to download it when i get back to walnut creek today

01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.480
it's sexy

01:29:06.480 --> 01:29:10.380
oh yeah it's sexy

01:29:10.380 --> 01:29:14.180
um... what now i guess we're gonna go ahead and get into the cage match and we'll come

01:29:14.180 --> 01:29:15.380
back and hopefully that

01:29:15.380 --> 01:29:18.180
call we can get to and then

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:19.900
the new game, we're talking about the new game now

01:29:19.900 --> 01:29:22.900
I know, I keep putting it off. Alright, let's talk about the new game now. Let's talk about the new game.

01:29:22.900 --> 01:29:27.900
Um, so I finally got to check out this game for the PlayStation 2, thanks to

01:29:27.900 --> 01:29:32.900
Islander and Iguana Girl bringing it over for me. It's called Technic Beat.

01:29:32.900 --> 01:29:35.900
And this game's actually been out for like two months, right? It's been out a little while.

01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:39.900
But I'm just now getting to see it, because I somehow completely missed this game.

01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:44.900
I heard about it like a month ago, but I'd really missed it somehow.

01:29:44.900 --> 01:29:47.900
Um, you're pretty familiar with this game, right Jess?

01:29:47.900 --> 01:29:48.900
Yeah.

01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.300
Tell us about how this game works.

01:29:50.300 --> 01:29:54.460
Well, the way this game works is very interesting.

01:29:54.460 --> 01:30:00.100
Basically, you choose a character and you start walking around on a kind of liquidy

01:30:00.100 --> 01:30:06.540
type surface, and then circles will appear, and then little circles will appear coming

01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:07.540
from it.

01:30:07.540 --> 01:30:13.780
And if you think of the big circles as like guide arrows in DDR, and the little circles

01:30:13.780 --> 01:30:19.140
coming out towards the other circle like the actual arrows then that's what it's

01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:23.840
kind of like it's basically you want to hit the ripples right so basically you

01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:27.300
have a little character you start riding around start hitting the ripples and the

01:30:27.300 --> 01:30:31.220
game is full of a bunch of Namco original songs like old-school Namco

01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:36.700
stuff like Thema Daruga and Pacmania Pacmania which is awesome

01:30:36.700 --> 01:30:41.540
Dig Dug even Point Blank but now there's kind of a tie into Bamani isn't there

01:30:41.540 --> 01:30:47.900
here? A little bit, yes, because basically the whole game is done by Sampling Masters,

01:30:47.900 --> 01:30:53.460
Aya and Mega, which are of Rotel da Moon, I mean, Rotel da Sun, Rotel da Mercury, blah

01:30:53.460 --> 01:30:57.260
blah blah, stuff like that, and they even have a Routine da Moon song, which is completely

01:30:57.260 --> 01:31:02.560
awesome in the game. Okay. So if you're a fan of that music in 2DX, you probably should

01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:07.120
check out this Technic Beat, because they did all the music. And that Pac-Mania song

01:31:07.120 --> 01:31:10.620
that I heard you play was awesome. That was good. And that was by Sampling Masters, Mega,

01:31:10.620 --> 01:31:12.620
One of the two. One of the two.

01:31:12.620 --> 01:31:14.620
Alright. Good stuff.

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:16.620
It was a little...

01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.620
It was different though. It was very different

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:20.620
compared to other music games I've played lately.

01:31:20.620 --> 01:31:22.620
Which is good though. I think they need to get away

01:31:22.620 --> 01:31:24.620
from the moving

01:31:24.620 --> 01:31:26.620
moving thing towards

01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:28.620
the line and stuff. You know, every

01:31:28.620 --> 01:31:30.620
game is starting to look like DDR.

01:31:30.620 --> 01:31:32.620
It's a lot more obscure. And that's what I like about it.

01:31:32.620 --> 01:31:34.620
Because it has you... Yeah, like you said

01:31:34.620 --> 01:31:36.620
a lot of things are basically, wait for it to

01:31:36.620 --> 01:31:38.620
get to this screen. Okay.

01:31:38.620 --> 01:31:43.620
This one you have to run around, and some characters can't run fast.

01:31:43.620 --> 01:31:48.620
And you have to kick the notes around sometimes, and then depending on which note you hit,

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:52.620
you'll actually kind of change the pitch of the music, which is pretty cool, I think.

01:31:52.620 --> 01:31:55.620
It's kind of fun to sometimes play it, and you get to remix your own a little bit.

01:31:55.620 --> 01:31:58.620
Kind of like Amplitude allows you to do, in a way.

01:31:58.620 --> 01:32:01.620
You can even have a remix mode in the game where you can make your own stuff.

01:32:01.620 --> 01:32:04.620
And there looked to be a lot of modes in Technic Beat.

01:32:04.620 --> 01:32:07.620
I didn't really get to play with a lot of the others. Have you checked out some of the other modes?

01:32:07.620 --> 01:32:12.620
Basically, it's basically the normal stuff they have, like non-stop mode is in there,

01:32:12.620 --> 01:32:16.620
free mode, like 2DX is in free mode after you play a song, it's unlocked in free mode.

01:32:16.620 --> 01:32:21.620
Which is hard because there's not really a way to keep track of the songs you've passed

01:32:21.620 --> 01:32:25.620
in regular game mode, so you're kind of guessing which ones you've passed already in free mode.

01:32:25.620 --> 01:32:29.620
Then you go back and check, oh, that's unlocked, yay, oh, that's, nah.

01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:35.620
So, yeah, it gets a little annoying, but still it's a great game because it has about 80 songs.

01:32:35.620 --> 01:32:40.980
and it's only twenty dollars. Yeah, it's one of these budget games, like

01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:44.260
it's kind of, Namco did this one right? Yeah. So

01:32:44.260 --> 01:32:47.540
that... No, it was a Mastiff

01:32:47.540 --> 01:32:51.020
and a Rika, which are basically a branch off of Namco. Okay.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:54.740
But Katamari Damacyu was also by Namco, and I think these two games came out

01:32:54.740 --> 01:32:58.460
together, actually, didn't they? Around?

01:32:58.460 --> 01:33:03.100
It came out in the same manner, like it wasn't released that much because they

01:33:03.100 --> 01:33:05.060
didn't think there were going to be a high demand for it.

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.140
And there hasn't been, so it's kind of like, eh.

01:33:08.140 --> 01:33:09.700
At least for Technic Beat there hasn't been.

01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:12.940
Now Katamari Damacy, they probably thought the same thing going into it, but boy were

01:33:12.940 --> 01:33:13.940
they wrong.

01:33:13.940 --> 01:33:14.940
Oh yeah.

01:33:14.940 --> 01:33:19.500
So, and I, but Technic Beat, and we've got a lot of folks in our town saying they never

01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:20.500
even heard of this game.

01:33:20.500 --> 01:33:21.500
Yeah.

01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:24.940
So, and it's not, you know, not surprising at all, but it is a new music rhythm game

01:33:24.940 --> 01:33:27.420
that's out there, and it's kind of different the way it works.

01:33:27.420 --> 01:33:31.380
You're not gonna know, a lot of the songs in there are gonna be unfamiliar to you unless

01:33:31.380 --> 01:33:34.200
you play a lot of old school 80s arcade games.

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:39.440
If you're a mame whore, like you're a mame whore, you've got that multi-arcade machine

01:33:39.440 --> 01:33:40.440
emulator?

01:33:40.440 --> 01:33:41.440
That is exactly it.

01:33:41.440 --> 01:33:43.680
Oh, I remembered.

01:33:43.680 --> 01:33:49.140
If you've got that on your computer, and you have all these ROMs from crazy places of games

01:33:49.140 --> 01:33:52.200
you've never heard of, which you're not supposed to do, because that's illegal, boys and girls,

01:33:52.200 --> 01:33:55.120
and I'm not encouraging you to do that, I'm just saying if you've already done it, then

01:33:55.120 --> 01:33:58.080
you probably are familiar with a lot of these old games, and they've remixed a lot of these

01:33:58.080 --> 01:34:00.120
old games, which is cool.

01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:01.120
Yeah.

01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:03.020
So, check it out!

01:34:03.020 --> 01:34:04.020
It's only 20 bucks.

01:34:04.020 --> 01:34:05.020
Yeah.

01:34:05.020 --> 01:34:09.660
So, wow, this will be a great opportunity to sell it on our website, but we just, you

01:34:09.660 --> 01:34:12.300
know, we're not that smart.

01:34:12.300 --> 01:34:13.300
Cry.

01:34:13.300 --> 01:34:14.500
Oh well.

01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:19.820
I did see that game while I was Christmas shopping, and the first thing I thought was,

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:22.760
ooh, should I get that for, no, what if it sucks?

01:34:22.760 --> 01:34:28.100
But now I know, so I might just have to like go down and get it tomorrow.

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:32.940
Now speaking of music games that suck, I know, Islander, you got a chance to play one not

01:34:32.940 --> 01:34:36.680
too long ago, right?

01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.220
Music games that suck?

01:34:38.220 --> 01:34:39.220
Yeah.

01:34:39.220 --> 01:34:41.900
One not too long ago.

01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:43.140
Oh, Jesus Christ!

01:34:43.140 --> 01:34:47.120
Let me give you a hint, let me give you a hint.

01:34:47.120 --> 01:34:52.180
All those people complaining about GameCube DDR, there's something out there for you.

01:34:52.180 --> 01:34:55.580
And really, you're not missing out.

01:34:55.580 --> 01:35:01.780
It's by MadCats, who, you know, for a long time have been making third-party controllers

01:35:01.780 --> 01:35:08.820
and such, and memory cards and other various accessories, but this being their first game,

01:35:08.820 --> 01:35:09.820
it was lacking.

01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820
Boy, was it lacking.

01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:12.300
That's putting it lightly.

01:35:12.300 --> 01:35:13.300
Oh, yes.

01:35:13.300 --> 01:35:14.300
Very lightly.

01:35:14.300 --> 01:35:15.780
It was a pile of steaming poopie.

01:35:15.780 --> 01:35:17.780
Well, yeah.

01:35:17.780 --> 01:35:21.540
The one saving grace was that the soundtrack wasn't bad.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:27.820
I liked a lot of the music in there, but dear lord, do I really like to play the full length

01:35:27.820 --> 01:35:30.980
five minute version of Parents Just Don't Understand on eight arrows?

01:35:30.980 --> 01:35:32.980
Do I really need to do this?

01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:34.740
Do the arrows even make any sense?

01:35:34.740 --> 01:35:35.740
Like do they...

01:35:35.740 --> 01:35:36.740
They're...

01:35:36.740 --> 01:35:37.740
Okay, imagine...

01:35:37.740 --> 01:35:41.380
Okay, now we were just discussing Technic Beat, how it has a circle and another circle

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:43.700
that comes out to meet it.

01:35:43.700 --> 01:35:47.180
Your arrows are set up in a circular manner.

01:35:47.180 --> 01:35:50.060
You have up, down, left, right and the four diagonals.

01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:55.060
and the arrows appear from the center and move outward.

01:35:55.060 --> 01:35:57.060
It's very strange looking.

01:35:57.060 --> 01:35:59.060
Which is confusing to begin with, a setup like that.

01:35:59.060 --> 01:36:06.060
Another option is the scroll mode, which turns it into DDR, but up and down are switched.

01:36:08.060 --> 01:36:10.060
And that was really confusing too.

01:36:10.060 --> 01:36:12.060
Yeah, exactly.

01:36:12.060 --> 01:36:16.060
That was like just uhhhh, I'm not...

01:36:16.060 --> 01:36:18.060
Damnit

01:36:19.780 --> 01:36:24.260
Wow, it's it was it was real bad as a matter of fact, I played it for about maybe 30 minutes

01:36:25.620 --> 01:36:27.980
Looked at you want a girl and said this is a piece of crap

01:36:28.580 --> 01:36:33.260
Threw it back in the box and went back to GameStop or yeah GameStop the very next day and said, you know

01:36:33.260 --> 01:36:37.100
What let me get a game that like is actually cool. Can I try this in for Mario Party 6?

01:36:38.620 --> 01:36:40.620
and

01:36:40.620 --> 01:36:43.900
It was and sure enough I was able to do that and get some money

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:47.100
being reimbursed to me, and I was very happy about that.

01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:50.340
And that's a good thing that you got Mario Party 6 out of it, because, you know, otherwise

01:36:50.340 --> 01:36:53.300
we wouldn't have had that on New Year's, and that was a lot of fun to play, so...

01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:55.300
Yeah, absolutely, absolutely.

01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:56.300
All right.

01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:02.300
But, boy, please, people, stay away from MC Groove's dance craze, please.

01:37:02.300 --> 01:37:05.800
I mean, the only reason I'd buy it is if it was, like, 20 bucks.

01:37:05.800 --> 01:37:06.800
How much was it?

01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:09.260
At the time, 60.

01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:11.380
Right now, it's going for 50.

01:37:11.380 --> 01:37:13.260
You've gotta be kidding me, 50 bucks?

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:14.260
Does it come with a pad or something?

01:37:14.260 --> 01:37:15.260
Yeah.

01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:16.260
It comes with a pad and a pad.

01:37:16.260 --> 01:37:17.260
Okay, but still!

01:37:17.260 --> 01:37:18.260
Yeah, exactly.

01:37:18.260 --> 01:37:19.260
Ooh.

01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:20.260
God.

01:37:20.260 --> 01:37:21.260
Oh, it was horrible.

01:37:21.260 --> 01:37:22.260
But even the Mad Cat's pad wouldn't even be worth $50.

01:37:22.260 --> 01:37:23.260
It sucks.

01:37:23.260 --> 01:37:30.080
I mean, it actually worked well, but I was like, ugh, just, ugh, it's just bad.

01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.080
People stay away, please.

01:37:31.080 --> 01:37:32.080
Get on the Mind?

01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:33.080
Ooh.

01:37:33.080 --> 01:37:40.640
That was one of the games we picked up, basically because we have Carrier Revolution Volume

01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:46.240
And we wanted to play duets with like two mics. So I bought I bought get on the mic for the second mic

01:37:47.040 --> 01:37:51.820
The game itself is actually pretty interesting. It uses a lot of I mean, of course, it's it's all hip-hop

01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.620
But it ranges from stuff like the newer stuff

01:37:56.520 --> 01:38:03.640
Gosh like turn it up and some other strange things or like party up DMX to like old-school stuff like Humpty dance and

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:09.920
and and and and the characters are just hilarious because like there's this one

01:38:09.920 --> 01:38:13.820
stage where you're just starting out your career and you're in your bathroom

01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:17.360
looking at yourself in the mirror trying to be all hardcore. Wasn't that a scene in

01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.940
8 Mile? Yeah, basically. It's funny because like your your boombox is on the

01:38:22.940 --> 01:38:26.900
shelf and it's like bouncing and it's and like if you're doing well the whole

01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:33.560
room starts like like bouncing and having fun. Yeah, pretty much. And it's

01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:37.900
like Parappa's bathroom level. Basically, there you go. There you go.

01:38:37.900 --> 01:38:43.500
He's not rapping about having to go to the bathroom. No, but like perhaps honestly my favorite song in that game. I know I know

01:38:44.460 --> 01:38:49.220
It's a great song in there may know in the snow. I got that really gotta go

01:38:56.580 --> 01:38:58.580
I made me laugh so hard. I peed a little

01:39:00.700 --> 01:39:04.020
Yeah, all right, please stay away from as he can't then see Cruz dance craze, please

01:39:04.020 --> 01:39:09.860
I got to check out a little bit of Donkey Konga this week because one of my buddies

01:39:09.860 --> 01:39:12.580
got it for Christmas and he said, you have to play it, you have to play it.

01:39:12.580 --> 01:39:14.940
So he brought it over, kind of like how you guys brought it over a couple weeks ago, but

01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:17.820
this time I actually had time to play it.

01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:21.380
I feel bad because you guys brought those games, we didn't even really get to them.

01:39:21.380 --> 01:39:26.740
But not to play a little more Donkey Konga, now I'd seen it at E3, and really the game

01:39:26.740 --> 01:39:30.640
was pretty much what I remembered at E3, there wasn't a whole lot different, but it's just,

01:39:30.640 --> 01:39:31.640
it's fun.

01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:32.640
It really is.

01:39:32.640 --> 01:39:36.740
game there's some songs in there that are really freaking cute like there's a

01:39:36.740 --> 01:39:41.980
cover of I think I love you so what am I so afraid but it's all like happy

01:39:41.980 --> 01:39:46.180
Britney style kind of but not not like Britney bad but like you know yeah but

01:39:46.180 --> 01:39:49.580
it has that like a cute Nazi feel to it it does and we got to get some of those

01:39:49.580 --> 01:39:51.500
songs and get them on orange on this radio because there's some really cute

01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:56.700
docu conga songs but then there's some like really really like okay this game

01:39:56.700 --> 01:40:01.300
is obviously for five-year-old songs because there's like the campfire medley

01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:08.300
There was a Foster's Medley in Taiko Drum Master 2, and I'm like, what the hell is this?

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:15.300
I came this close to picking up Taiko Drum Master today. I saw it sitting on the shelf, and I was like, it's calling my name.

01:40:15.300 --> 01:40:16.300
Get it, get it.

01:40:16.300 --> 01:40:21.300
But then I was like, must save money for something else.

01:40:21.300 --> 01:40:27.300
I want that game. But I still want a freaking second pair of maracas.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:30.300
They stopped making Samba de Amigo like three years ago.

01:40:30.300 --> 01:40:32.300
I wanted them to bring out the tambourine one.

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:34.300
Seriously, the tambourine game?

01:40:34.300 --> 01:40:36.300
I would be all over the freaking tambourine game.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.300
This coming from somebody who has played

01:40:38.300 --> 01:40:40.300
Dance Dance Revolution,

01:40:40.300 --> 01:40:42.300
Para Para Paradise,

01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:44.300
I've played just about

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:46.300
almost every music

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.300
game out there.

01:40:48.300 --> 01:40:50.300
The tambourine game did come out.

01:40:50.300 --> 01:40:52.300
The tambourine game is the gayest

01:40:52.300 --> 01:40:54.300
music game I've ever played.

01:40:54.300 --> 01:40:56.300
I don't care, I'm a chick, I can get away with it.

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:58.300
You can, but I'm just saying.

01:40:58.300 --> 01:41:03.880
You think Para Para is bad? Play the, what's the tambourine game called? Tambourine something.

01:41:03.880 --> 01:41:08.080
Tambourine something. I'll find out the name. Wow. Give me a sec, I'll find out the name.

01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:15.080
Alright. Mr. Tambourine Man. Mr. Tambourine Haynes. Yeah, but nothing like those fifteen

01:41:15.140 --> 01:41:19.860
pound samba controllers. Dear lord. Samba was such a fun game though, it's such a pity.

01:41:19.860 --> 01:41:23.420
Wasn't it? Well, you know it's gonna have a little revival because the itoy thing, the

01:41:23.420 --> 01:41:27.640
Sega itoy is gonna have a samba minigame in it. But man, it was just fun for those random

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:33.680
composers you have to do those are always great which which which reminds

01:41:33.680 --> 01:41:41.480
me Jamie Samba on iToy travesty or best thing ever I hate the iToy so travesty

01:41:41.480 --> 01:41:49.040
all right just curious all right all right yeah how about that cage match how

01:41:49.040 --> 01:41:54.600
about that cage match let's get into the cage match we're gonna get into it here

01:41:54.600 --> 01:42:01.760
Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, we were missing a host, so we

01:42:01.760 --> 01:42:04.360
didn't get a song, because Jamie was out sick.

01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:05.360
Got the name.

01:42:05.360 --> 01:42:06.360
Oh.

01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:07.360
Chacato Tambourine, I think.

01:42:07.360 --> 01:42:08.360
Oh.

01:42:08.360 --> 01:42:10.360
So, what, shake that tambourine, basically?

01:42:10.360 --> 01:42:11.360
Basically.

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.360
Alright.

01:42:12.360 --> 01:42:17.440
Anyway, we were down a host last week, so we let you guys, the listeners, do something

01:42:17.440 --> 01:42:25.180
you have been begging us to do for years now and that is a chat room choice song

01:42:25.180 --> 01:42:30.100
for the cage match so we let a random chat room listener which was I believe

01:42:30.100 --> 01:42:32.940
it was big red pimp ended up picking this right and angel you helped them

01:42:32.940 --> 01:42:38.020
find it or something well no actually he already had it and he told me what it

01:42:38.020 --> 01:42:44.060
was over private message I'm like oh that's cool all right so we had

01:42:44.060 --> 01:42:47.140
everybody in the chat room submit a random entry and we picked one at random

01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:51.700
And it was this one and sure enough you let the chat room put a song in the cage match and of course

01:42:51.700 --> 01:42:53.700
They're gonna vote for it. So that's on one. Oh

01:42:56.260 --> 01:42:58.260
I thought you had a comment. So

01:42:58.380 --> 01:43:04.740
What that means is that cage match is all screwed up now because we have a chat room choice sitting there in the cage match

01:43:04.740 --> 01:43:07.860
So what we're gonna do is know what we're gonna do is this

01:43:08.460 --> 01:43:11.700
Since Jamie stepped aside last week for the chat room choice

01:43:11.700 --> 01:43:16.220
I will step aside this week so the chat room choice can be in and if for whatever reason it wins again

01:43:16.220 --> 01:43:17.220
again.

01:43:17.220 --> 01:43:18.220
Loki will be out next week.

01:43:18.220 --> 01:43:19.220
Okay?

01:43:19.220 --> 01:43:21.380
That means you just didn't want to pick a song this week?

01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:23.340
No, because I have a good song.

01:43:23.340 --> 01:43:26.340
I have a good song, but I just, I'm going to step aside this week.

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.180
Did you listen, by the way, at my suggestion?

01:43:28.180 --> 01:43:29.180
I haven't had a chance to.

01:43:29.180 --> 01:43:31.220
I'm going to hear it for the first time tonight, so we'll see.

01:43:31.220 --> 01:43:32.620
Alright, here we go.

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:37.220
So song number one, last week's winner, is a group, you guys know this one if you listen

01:43:37.220 --> 01:43:42.100
to any J-Rock, Lark and Seal did this song, and the song is called Ready Steady Go, and

01:43:42.100 --> 01:43:45.740
no, it's not anything like the Paul Logan fold one, okay?

01:43:45.740 --> 01:43:50.060
Alright so again the way the cage match works we play three songs for your listening pleasure

01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:51.380
or displeasure.

01:43:51.380 --> 01:43:55.080
You pick your favorite and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange

01:43:55.080 --> 01:43:59.300
Lawns Radio's Hermione Music and More program which runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on

01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:01.420
the station when we're not live.

01:44:01.420 --> 01:44:06.880
Alright so here it is, oh and remember you gotta be in our chat room to participate so

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:11.700
head on over to www.orangelawnsradio.com and click on chat now so you can participate.

01:44:11.700 --> 01:44:19.380
Alright, that being said, here it is. Song number one, a clip, because it won last week, so you already know what it sounds like. A clip of Lark and Seal. Ready, steady, go.

01:45:41.700 --> 01:46:01.260
Alright, that was song number one in tonight's cage match, the chat room choice, which I'm

01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:06.300
stepping aside for, is that that song can continue to stay in cage match until it gets

01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:07.300
voted out.

01:46:07.300 --> 01:46:11.300
That's Lark and Seal with Ready Steady Go and so let's get into tonight's two

01:46:11.300 --> 01:46:14.440
challengers that will be battling that song.

01:46:14.440 --> 01:46:18.300
Well I just have to make one comment since I wasn't here last week.

01:46:18.300 --> 01:46:21.480
I do really like Lark and Seal.

01:46:21.480 --> 01:46:25.700
I don't like that as the opening theme for SMA.

01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:28.900
Lark and Seal's done a lot better.

01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:32.340
A lot better. Since Jamie didn't get to make her comment last week, there you go.

01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:34.220
On a scale of one to ten.

01:46:34.220 --> 01:46:37.220
It's a seven. I mean, it's a good song. Don't get me wrong. It's just...

01:46:37.220 --> 01:46:42.920
And I should like the opening sequence for FMA, but it just doesn't fit. It doesn't fit.

01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:49.720
Let me put it this way. I was really scared when we were opening it up to a random chatroom song of what we were gonna get.

01:46:49.720 --> 01:46:53.920
It could have been a lot worse. It could have been a lot worse.

01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:56.920
So, chatroom did okay on that one, so I'm not gonna complain.

01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:03.920
Alright, here we go. Song number two tonight is gonna come to us from Loki. And, uh, Loki, what are you picking tonight?

01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:25.920
I'm picking, uh, first I found the remix album, then I found the original CD, but this is from a group that's calling themselves ProdigyRemix.com, and it's actually a group of about four different, um, remixers that completely remixed the brand new album from Prodigy, um, which is always outnumbered and never outgunned.

01:47:25.920 --> 01:47:35.400
This one is Always Outsiders, Never Outdone, and this is their track Girls, which is Girls

01:47:35.400 --> 01:47:41.840
the Idiotek Remix, which is pretty interesting, it's just a strange song.

01:47:41.840 --> 01:47:46.120
Alright Loki says strange song, we will find out, is the cage match worthy?

01:47:46.120 --> 01:47:53.120
We'll find out. This is ProdigyRemix.com with girls, the Idiotek remix. Enjoy!

01:48:46.120 --> 01:49:10.440
It will be a mission now It will be a mission now

01:49:10.440 --> 01:49:13.740
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:13.440 --> 01:49:15.700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:16.440 --> 01:49:17.680
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:20.680
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:21.440 --> 01:49:24.140
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.340
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:24.440 --> 01:49:26.700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:26.940
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:26.440 --> 01:49:26.900
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:29.700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:34.240
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:35.700
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.840
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:38.800
Speed it up, it hydraulic speed, pour a EVs

01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:41.660
I'm going to go look at all the young girls

01:49:41.660 --> 01:49:42.680
Who's your last one?

01:49:42.680 --> 01:49:43.800
Who's the end?

01:49:43.800 --> 01:49:45.140
I'm gonna catch you later

01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:48.520
I'm going to go look at all the young girls

01:49:48.520 --> 01:49:50.520
Oh

01:51:48.520 --> 01:51:50.520
Oh

01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:20.520
Oh

01:52:48.520 --> 01:53:12.760
Okay, I just want to preface, before we judge the song, I want to preface with this.

01:53:12.760 --> 01:53:16.600
We've been doing the cage match for about two years now.

01:53:16.600 --> 01:53:21.960
I have been waiting that entire two years for a moment like this.

01:53:21.960 --> 01:53:26.280
That being said, Jamie, what did you think of that?

01:53:26.280 --> 01:53:28.200
It stopped!

01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.440
Zero!

01:53:29.440 --> 01:53:33.400
Islander, negative two.

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:34.400
Jazz.

01:53:34.400 --> 01:53:35.400
Girl.

01:53:35.400 --> 01:53:36.400
Girl.

01:53:36.400 --> 01:53:39.400
You don't like girls.

01:53:39.400 --> 01:53:40.400
Zero.

01:53:40.400 --> 01:53:44.580
I want a girl.

01:53:44.580 --> 01:53:51.580
That was something from Prodigy?

01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:55.500
Oh, I was waiting for a number, I'm sorry.

01:53:55.500 --> 01:53:57.380
Zero. Oh, okay.

01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:59.880
Uh, Loki!

01:53:59.880 --> 01:54:01.380
You know,

01:54:01.380 --> 01:54:06.020
what's sad is that this remixed version was better than the original.

01:54:06.020 --> 01:54:08.380
That's the worst part of it.

01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:11.740
You know what? I just picked a song because I had nothing else.

01:54:11.740 --> 01:54:13.420
Next week is when I'll have the good stuff.

01:54:13.420 --> 01:54:17.860
That's what I was trying to download, but, you know,

01:54:17.860 --> 01:54:20.880
I just found it too late, so, it's alright.

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:25.660
But, uh, I give it a zero just to go with everyone else.

01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:26.940
Um,

01:54:26.940 --> 01:54:28.820
you know what?

01:54:28.820 --> 01:54:33.060
Loki, after all the shitty songs I've put in the cage match, cause there's been a

01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:38.420
few, I'm really glad that it's not just me. Zero, Angel.

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:40.880
Um, negative 999, that's all.

01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.880
Oh my god, she didn't do something nice!

01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:47.880
Holy crap, you've given the tennis some really bad stuff!

01:54:50.880 --> 01:54:53.880
I mean, I'm not meaning this in a mean way, but...

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:55.880
I'm surprised!

01:54:55.880 --> 01:54:59.880
Yeah, uh... I don't know.

01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:00.880
I, I...

01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:05.880
We'll remind you though, your singing actually did get voted in for, uh...

01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:07.880
For the weekly pick, so...

01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:08.880
If?

01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:11.680
Yeah, I think your singing is better than girls.

01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:12.960
I would like to point this out.

01:55:12.960 --> 01:55:14.800
Girls, girls, girls, girls.

01:55:14.800 --> 01:55:18.080
Loki, Loki now can attest to this.

01:55:18.080 --> 01:55:21.920
This is the first time a song has ever been put in the cage match

01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:26.960
and gotten zeroes from every single judge, including the one who put it in.

01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:30.500
Wow.

01:55:31.200 --> 01:55:33.360
We have orange elves history tonight.

01:55:33.360 --> 01:55:37.200
I think we've had one where I put it in and everybody else gave it a zero,

01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:40.600
But I gave it a hundred to balance it out. I don't remember what song it was

01:55:40.600 --> 01:55:44.880
I know it. I know I've been there, but remember you know what our opinion sucks

01:55:45.320 --> 01:55:49.800
Will the chat room vote it in just to be funny and let me tell you that would not be funny

01:55:50.600 --> 01:55:52.960
We'll find out because it's really up to the chat room

01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.960
Jamie

01:55:56.520 --> 01:55:58.280
Yeah, that's right you'd have to listen to all week

01:55:58.280 --> 01:56:02.320
And you would have to hear it again next week, and I'll play a long clip of that song next week

01:56:09.320 --> 01:56:13.380
Like why are you giving the chairman ultimatum? You know they're gonna be mean right back at us

01:56:14.160 --> 01:56:17.800
Love you chat room that being said let's give them another option Jamie. I

01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.400
Forgot who it is that did this again

01:56:20.400 --> 01:56:25.960
But there was a song and I think I really do think that this is one that I had on a tape that I bought

01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:30.960
I got it The Limited back when I was in my senior year of high school, taking French.

01:56:30.960 --> 01:56:32.960
And I bought the CD, the tape, because it was all in French.

01:56:32.960 --> 01:56:35.960
I was like, oh cool, I can use it to, you know, practice.

01:56:35.960 --> 01:56:40.960
It's a song called Jola Taxi that I really liked.

01:56:40.960 --> 01:56:44.960
I mean, it was a cute song, and I was looking for it and found a remix of it.

01:56:44.960 --> 01:56:48.960
And this has actually been sort of edging me back into trance, believe it or not.

01:56:48.960 --> 01:56:51.960
So this is a trance mix of Jola Taxi.

01:56:51.960 --> 01:56:55.960
Alright, now the full name of this is huge, so I'm only going to read it once, kids. Here it is.

01:56:55.960 --> 01:57:03.960
The artist, Aria Posey, and the song, Joe Lataxi, and it's the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

01:57:03.960 --> 01:57:05.960
Okay?

01:57:05.960 --> 01:57:06.960
Wow, that's pretty damn long.

01:57:06.960 --> 01:57:08.960
Here it is, song number 3, enjoy!

02:00:36.960 --> 02:00:51.040
All right, let's see what everybody thought about song number three.

02:00:51.040 --> 02:00:53.720
We'll just call it Joe La Taxi for short.

02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:54.720
Jamie?

02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:57.440
I've just been listening to that song on repeat.

02:00:57.440 --> 02:00:58.440
I mean, actually, it was...

02:00:58.440 --> 02:01:03.560
I was listening to it earlier today just trying to keep myself in a good mood, and I give

02:01:03.560 --> 02:01:04.560
it a nine.

02:01:04.560 --> 02:01:08.540
I like I'm still not quite my chance, but it had to have a couple of slightly

02:01:08.980 --> 02:01:13.100
Overly trancy annoying things in it, but overall it's such a good song and I like the original

02:01:13.800 --> 02:01:17.680
Okay, did you want to get your thought in before you head off? Okay. All right, Jess. I

02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.560
Thought it was okay

02:01:19.560 --> 02:01:25.880
It seems very kind of Jay trancy to me like something at UMI would do a lot to me and that's okay

02:01:25.880 --> 02:01:28.440
But I don't know it got a little too trancy for me

02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:32.440
Just giving it generic termsy for me, but it was still good, so I'd give it like a 7.

02:01:35.440 --> 02:01:37.440
You know, that was actually the same score I was gonna give it myself.

02:01:38.440 --> 02:01:41.440
I did like it a lot, and I liked it a lot better than some of the other stuff that was played.

02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:48.440
played? That being said, yes. A good solid 7. That sounds very good.

02:01:48.440 --> 02:01:53.120
Uh, you know, that song was kind of odd, but it was odd in a good way. Like, it was kind

02:01:53.120 --> 02:01:58.680
of one of those songs I just go, huh, that's kind of neat. Um, so, and honestly, this week

02:01:58.680 --> 02:02:04.840
it better win, so I give it a 9. Girls. Like the French, I wanted the retreat from this

02:02:04.840 --> 02:02:15.720
song so it gets a five because it's not sorry hey Joel I like it's bouncy it's

02:02:15.720 --> 02:02:22.160
happy it's any all right you've heard what we have to say now let's hear what

That's it. I know what I'm going to do.

02:03:29.560 --> 02:03:31.720
Loki's shaking his finger at me. What?

02:03:31.720 --> 02:03:35.000
I'm going to change my F.U. music to that.

02:03:35.000 --> 02:03:38.120
Loki wants to change his F.U. music to that song.

02:03:38.120 --> 02:03:42.320
can't. Jackety Sax is so good though. You've been threatening to change your

02:03:42.320 --> 02:03:50.000
F.U. song for a while. Alright. Place your vote now guys. Hopefully somebody will

02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:56.960
remind you there in the chat room how you can place your vote if you haven't

02:03:56.960 --> 02:03:59.600
done so yet.

02:04:02.120 --> 02:04:07.600
Alright. Moving on. I was gonna take a call on the Skype line but I'm gonna I'm

02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:10.600
I'm going to hold off on that for just a minute because I just remembered something and I

02:04:10.600 --> 02:04:13.040
was like, oh yeah, let's wait on it for a minute.

02:04:13.040 --> 02:04:15.960
So we'll do that Skype line thing in a little bit.

02:04:15.960 --> 02:04:19.360
We're going to go to a quick break, I think, and then come back.

02:04:19.360 --> 02:04:24.400
Before we go to the break, though, I thought I'd scan around, see if there's any big news

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:28.720
going on here we should talk about.

02:04:28.720 --> 02:04:29.720
What about the...

02:04:29.720 --> 02:04:30.720
Oh yeah, tell me about this.

02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.080
This is another game I got to play for the first time this week, the guy game.

02:04:33.080 --> 02:04:35.040
Tell us about what's going on there.

02:04:35.040 --> 02:04:37.280
It's being recalled.

02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:57.280
There is a lawsuit there against, well obviously her name is being withheld, they're just calling her Jane Doe, but she is suing both Top Heavy Studios, the producers of the game, Sony, and Microsoft for having it been released since it features her in Spring Break topless at the age of 17.

02:04:57.280 --> 02:05:01.620
Lovely.

02:05:01.620 --> 02:05:06.360
Yeah. Lovely, lovely, lovely. Dun, dun, dun.

02:05:06.360 --> 02:05:10.600
So now the game's getting recalled. Oh yeah, so it's being yanked off store shelves with the

02:05:10.600 --> 02:05:11.240
quickness.

02:05:11.240 --> 02:05:15.040
I was able to snag an Xbox copy for my

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:18.560
cousin for Christmas and I told him if you ever sell this thing I will fucking kill you.

02:05:18.560 --> 02:05:22.280
You could ebay this probably in about a year for some big cash, who knows?

02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:25.840
Seriously, it's a collector's item now. It's right up there with Custer's Revenge now at this

02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:26.220
point.

02:05:26.220 --> 02:05:28.780
Oh yeah, seriously. Oh yeah. Definitely.

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:35.880
Alright, we're going to go to a break now and when we come back from this break we'll

02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:39.960
go to the Skype line and we'll hear who won tonight's cage match and we're going to get

02:05:39.960 --> 02:05:46.200
into the FUs of the week. Busy show still ahead, so don't go anywhere. We will be back

02:05:46.200 --> 02:05:48.980
after this break and I haven't even really thought about what kind of theme we should

02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:57.180
to do this break. Maybe, um... No, we're not going to play Girls again. Let's play, I don't

02:05:57.180 --> 02:06:01.620
know, I want to play a song we don't usually play. How about some BeatMania 5 key stuff?

02:06:01.620 --> 02:06:04.980
We haven't heard some 5 key stuff in a while. Here's something from BeatMania Final. This

02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:11.980
This is Fellows. We'll be back after this.

02:07:34.980 --> 02:07:49.980
Yeah, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

02:08:04.980 --> 02:08:13.040
ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶ðŸŽ¶

02:08:34.980 --> 02:08:36.980
That a castle there

02:09:04.980 --> 02:09:08.980
No matter what they do, they're gonna keep me gone

02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:10.980
You know what they mean?

02:09:10.980 --> 02:09:13.980
I'll see them again

02:09:13.980 --> 02:09:18.480
Giiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

02:10:43.980 --> 02:11:11.700
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock, this is the way we vibe, as we demonstrate,

02:11:11.700 --> 02:11:15.300
As we demonstrate, everybody wants a piece of the pie

02:11:15.300 --> 02:11:16.900
Bolsa mila means the eye

02:11:16.900 --> 02:11:18.700
Coso dos are like having the eye, know the fight

02:11:18.700 --> 02:11:20.700
Cos I spy, image fly

02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:23.300
This is the way we dance, this is the way we rock

02:11:23.300 --> 02:11:26.100
This is the way we ride, as we demonstrate

02:11:26.100 --> 02:11:27.340
As we demonstrate

02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:45.840
This is the sounds

02:11:47.520 --> 02:11:48.940
This is the sounds

02:11:49.320 --> 02:11:50.980
Everybody wants a piece of the pie

02:11:50.980 --> 02:11:52.480
Both of me that means the eye

02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:54.480
Cause I'm losing like everybody I know the vibe

02:12:24.480 --> 02:12:34.480
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:43.480
We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 125.

02:12:43.480 --> 02:12:48.480
And let's find out who won tonight's cage match. I know you boys and girls are really excited.

02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:55.280
All right, let's find out by one vote this song won

02:12:58.280 --> 02:13:00.280
By one vote

02:13:02.760 --> 02:13:04.760
Don't attack see

02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.960
Winner of the year you do

02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:17.960
I'm special. Might I add? It tastes like purple. Might I add, that was one vote over song number two.

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:29.960
You are shitting me. No. So who do we ban? I can't say, I'm sworn to secrecy. One vote over song number two.

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:41.960
Some folks trying to be funny. The chatroom is full of fuckhards. Song number one not forgotten about, not forgotten about by any means, but a little bit left in the dust there with the rest of the controversy, so sorry guys.

02:13:41.960 --> 02:13:50.960
But maybe we'll do the chatroom choice again sometime at a later date. Girls. Girls.

02:13:50.960 --> 02:13:58.080
Alright, I think what we're going to do is we're going to go to the Skype line in a minute

02:13:58.080 --> 02:13:59.080
here.

02:13:59.080 --> 02:14:04.300
We're going to do that and also we're going to be doing the FUs of the week momentarily,

02:14:04.300 --> 02:14:09.900
so send those FUs over to Sky via private message and we'll take those.

02:14:09.900 --> 02:14:12.600
In the meantime, let's go to the Skype line.

02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:16.260
Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:14:16.260 --> 02:14:17.260
Is this me?

02:14:17.260 --> 02:14:18.260
No, this is not.

02:14:18.260 --> 02:14:19.260
Hello?

02:14:19.260 --> 02:14:20.260
This is me.

02:14:20.260 --> 02:14:23.860
Hi. How are you? Good. Who's this? I'm on the air.

02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:27.220
Hi on the air. How are you? I'm moist.

02:14:27.220 --> 02:14:30.220
Aren't you always?

02:14:30.220 --> 02:14:33.220
Well, when I think of you, yes.

02:14:33.220 --> 02:14:37.420
And then the minute I hear Rob's voice, it shrinks up.

02:14:37.420 --> 02:14:40.580
Tell him who you are, asshole.

02:14:40.580 --> 02:14:46.540
I'm the asshole. Don't you want to be my friend?

02:14:46.540 --> 02:14:50.140
The asshole formerly known as the Asshole of the Dance.

02:14:50.140 --> 02:14:57.940
don't make me come back there the one the one and only and never replaceable

02:14:57.940 --> 02:15:09.540
asshole yeah come on say all right it Travis from under sedation live.org oh

02:15:09.540 --> 02:15:15.060
you like that don't you yes oh you like that bitch Duncan huh what do you want

02:15:15.060 --> 02:15:19.780
Travis did you just call in to taunt us well actually I had a rant but I'm gonna

02:15:19.780 --> 02:15:24.780
We'll get to that in a second. You guys were talking about, obviously you had an annoying song on earlier.

02:15:24.780 --> 02:15:25.780
Yes, we did.

02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:28.780
I guess it was something that was catastrophically annoying.

02:15:28.780 --> 02:15:29.780
Yes, it was.

02:15:29.780 --> 02:15:31.780
Well, I found something worse.

02:15:31.780 --> 02:15:32.780
Okay.

02:15:37.780 --> 02:15:39.780
Isn't this annoying?

02:15:42.780 --> 02:15:44.780
Sounds like a game, doesn't it?

02:15:44.780 --> 02:15:45.780
Yeah.

02:15:45.780 --> 02:15:47.780
Can you even hear it?

02:15:47.780 --> 02:15:48.780
Yes, I can. I can hear it.

02:15:48.780 --> 02:15:53.780
Good!

02:15:53.880 --> 02:15:54.880
That's worse...

02:15:54.980 --> 02:15:56.480
What is that?

02:15:56.580 --> 02:15:59.580
That's from life aquatic.

02:16:00.880 --> 02:16:03.280
Oh, so that's the trailer in the movie the life aquatic?

02:16:03.380 --> 02:16:04.680
Yeah, that's from the movie the life aquatic.

02:16:04.780 --> 02:16:08.380
Is that supposed to be going under the sea music?

02:16:08.480 --> 02:16:11.280
That is, that's going under the sea music...

02:16:11.380 --> 02:16:13.480
That's the music that's playing in Bill Murray's helmet.

02:16:13.580 --> 02:16:15.180
It was kind of funky.

02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:17.480
That's right, that was on the trailer!

02:16:17.480 --> 02:16:19.280
Yeah, and he starts doing that little butt shake.

02:16:19.280 --> 02:16:21.160
I need to see that movie.

02:16:21.160 --> 02:16:24.760
It was, I don't know, the girl's song, not Funky.

02:16:24.760 --> 02:16:25.760
That song, Funky.

02:16:25.760 --> 02:16:26.760
I don't know.

02:16:26.760 --> 02:16:29.580
Dude, that one's kind of groovy, if annoying.

02:16:29.580 --> 02:16:33.120
But I'm amazed Rob didn't play this when that song was on.

02:16:33.120 --> 02:16:37.800
In my opinion, and I have an opinion on this show, they are losers.

02:16:37.800 --> 02:16:42.160
Because Rob, your man is back in what, two weeks, three weeks?

02:16:42.160 --> 02:16:45.680
Yes, Simon, my idol, yes, he's back.

02:16:45.680 --> 02:16:48.080
I'm actually going to try and watch American Idol this year.

02:16:48.080 --> 02:16:50.760
I didn't watch it last year.

02:16:50.760 --> 02:16:54.440
But I do... I have an F.U.

02:16:54.440 --> 02:16:59.800
Okay, we're going to be getting into that soon, so why not give us a preemptive F.U. here?

02:16:59.800 --> 02:17:03.720
Oh, a preemptive F.U.? Whatever, a pre-school...

02:17:03.720 --> 02:17:08.840
I don't know. Fine, we'll call it a four-play F.U. How's that?

02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:14.320
Okay, well let me transition. Okay.

02:17:14.320 --> 02:17:17.480
at a transition into FU mode

02:17:17.480 --> 02:17:20.940
because you're like the only outlet i can go to when it comes to video games

02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:21.820
is you guys

02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:25.000
well that's what we're here for okay

02:17:25.000 --> 02:17:29.120
so i thought i'd get this out of my

02:17:29.120 --> 02:17:30.520
out in the open now

02:17:30.520 --> 02:17:31.700
i'm fucking

02:17:31.700 --> 02:17:33.760
can i say that on this show?

02:17:33.760 --> 02:17:35.560
uh... yes you fucking can

02:17:35.560 --> 02:17:37.980
oh thank you fucking much

02:17:37.980 --> 02:17:42.280
i'm sick and fucking tired of all these jack-ons on halo 2 who are fucking

02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:47.080
cheating out the ass with standbys on their cable modems.

02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:48.920
How do you cheat in Halo 2?

02:17:48.920 --> 02:17:53.960
You put your cable modem on standby in multiplayer games like capture the flag, assault and all

02:17:53.960 --> 02:17:55.860
that shit.

02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:00.440
So while everyone else goes into reconnection oblivion, you're still playing your game.

02:18:00.440 --> 02:18:05.160
You got the bomb, you got the flag, you go right to the gold point, set the bomb off

02:18:05.160 --> 02:18:09.640
or capture the flag, take your modem out of standby and boom, you've suddenly got a point.

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:10.640
Genius.

02:18:10.640 --> 02:18:16.640
Thank you for telling all our listeners how to cheat at Halo. I'm sure they're all going to go do it right now.

02:18:16.640 --> 02:18:26.640
What everybody needs to do is go to bungee.net, the people behind Halo 2, get on their forum boards, report people that do this shit, and get these people banned off Xbox Live.

02:18:26.640 --> 02:18:34.640
No, what's also great is those people that mod their controllers for burst firing in Halo 2. I've seen that also. That's ridiculous.

02:18:34.640 --> 02:18:39.640
That's not cheating. That's just competitive play.

02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:43.080
I see. Meaning that Travis doesn't. I see, okay.

02:18:43.080 --> 02:18:46.240
Alright. That's called taking advantage of the scenario. Alright.

02:18:46.240 --> 02:18:49.800
Okay, just like grabbing the flag through the wall. That's fun as hell.

02:18:49.800 --> 02:18:54.660
Now, is it true that Bungie erased everybody's data sometime in the

02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:56.820
past couple days, like all the Rumble Slayer

02:18:56.820 --> 02:19:01.140
stuff went bye-bye? I heard this. If they haven't already done it, they are in the

02:19:01.140 --> 02:19:04.720
process of doing this, because I've talked to a couple people in the community

02:19:04.720 --> 02:19:09.100
and Bungie, they're even trying to find a way to work around

02:19:09.100 --> 02:19:11.980
the the stand i don't know what to play here was one line dot that was the

02:19:11.980 --> 02:19:13.780
need is thing the world was

02:19:13.780 --> 02:19:16.780
wind your game goes in the lagging you disconnect

02:19:16.780 --> 02:19:19.580
you don't lose the game entirely you just pick up where you left off

02:19:19.580 --> 02:19:22.160
everything's fine you just keep on playing

02:19:22.160 --> 02:19:24.260
well unfortunately is little you know

02:19:24.260 --> 02:19:29.360
fourteen-year-old ass wipes to you know get off on gushing on pictures of lindsey

02:19:29.360 --> 02:19:33.180
low hand in entertainment weekly who have no life but drinking you who

02:19:33.180 --> 02:19:36.760
anything being dong's have found this little loophole through their cable

02:19:36.760 --> 02:19:38.880
modems

02:19:38.880 --> 02:19:45.000
So, you know, these, by the way, being the same 14 year olds that get on Xbox Live and

02:19:45.000 --> 02:19:49.560
while you're playing them go, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga!

02:19:49.560 --> 02:19:51.680
And they're as white as you, Rob.

02:19:51.680 --> 02:19:54.660
Exactly, they are, whiter, in fact, if you can believe it.

02:19:54.660 --> 02:19:57.960
And you can hear it in their voice, and what's funny is when I'm playing with one of my friends

02:19:57.960 --> 02:20:05.240
who happens to be a man of color, listening to him crack up, listening to these guys go,

02:20:05.240 --> 02:20:07.740
Oh, you nigga this, you nigga. Oh, I got you, nigga.

02:20:07.740 --> 02:20:14.740
You know, and he just, he takes great pride and pleasure in coming behind them during the game and just beating them down.

02:20:14.740 --> 02:20:20.740
If I could count the number of times I've heard, I'm Rick James, bitch, on Xbox Live.

02:20:20.740 --> 02:20:25.740
Yeah, when will people, when will they realize Dave Chappelle is not that funny?

02:20:25.740 --> 02:20:28.740
Well, I don't know. The Grand Theft Auto sketch is pretty funny. Have you seen this?

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:31.740
He's got his hits and misses, but he does have hits and misses.

02:20:31.740 --> 02:20:34.240
Wayne Brady? Hilarious.

02:20:34.240 --> 02:20:36.240
Yeah, okay

02:20:36.280 --> 02:20:38.280
Jack Black not funny

02:20:38.360 --> 02:20:43.880
You know stuff like that. I mean, I mean us white people we got Jack Black and unfortunately, you know

02:20:43.880 --> 02:20:47.040
The the african-american community has Dave Chappelle. So, you know

02:20:48.040 --> 02:20:50.600
Alright, but you know what? I mean, I'm serious

02:20:52.640 --> 02:20:58.760
Hang on you have to go back a little bit with the Jack Black stuff and you have to go back to mr. Show

02:20:58.760 --> 02:21:00.520
No.

02:21:00.520 --> 02:21:02.760
He ruined every episode he was in.

02:21:02.760 --> 02:21:03.760
No way.

02:21:03.760 --> 02:21:04.760
No way.

02:21:04.760 --> 02:21:05.760
I'm sorry.

02:21:05.760 --> 02:21:06.760
Jeepers Creepers.

02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:07.760
Don't put your dick in these holes.

02:21:07.760 --> 02:21:08.760
That's classic.

02:21:08.760 --> 02:21:09.840
Jeepers Creepers.

02:21:09.840 --> 02:21:11.860
He ruined that one.

02:21:11.860 --> 02:21:14.000
He ruined the farmer bit.

02:21:14.000 --> 02:21:15.000
No.

02:21:15.000 --> 02:21:16.800
He's ruined all the shit.

02:21:16.800 --> 02:21:17.800
I don't like him.

02:21:17.800 --> 02:21:18.800
No.

02:21:18.800 --> 02:21:19.800
I hated him.

02:21:19.800 --> 02:21:20.800
I can't stand Tenacious D.

02:21:20.800 --> 02:21:24.440
Have you even bothered to see School of Rock?

02:21:24.440 --> 02:21:25.440
Yes I have.

02:21:25.440 --> 02:21:31.080
Unfortunately, my place has a habit of showing it multiple times on the electronics section,

02:21:31.080 --> 02:21:35.440
so I unfortunately am cursed with seeing that movie.

02:21:35.440 --> 02:21:39.680
So, how are you doing, Jess?

02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:40.680
I'm in pain.

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:41.680
Why?

02:21:41.680 --> 02:21:42.680
What's wrong, hon?

02:21:42.680 --> 02:21:48.760
My left side hurts for no apparent reason, and it has been since, like, Friday, so I'm

02:21:48.760 --> 02:21:52.560
trying to determine if it's because of working out too much or not.

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.560
Well, you know what it could be, now that I think about it, you know?

02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:57.560
I'm not pregnant!

02:21:57.560 --> 02:21:58.560
No, no, no!

02:21:58.560 --> 02:22:00.560
I don't have AIDS!

02:22:00.560 --> 02:22:02.560
It could be a tumor!

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:03.560
It's not a tumor!

02:22:03.560 --> 02:22:04.560
It's not a tumor!

02:22:04.560 --> 02:22:05.560
Okay.

02:22:05.560 --> 02:22:10.560
See, I could play, you know?

02:22:10.560 --> 02:22:12.560
I envy your soundboard, what can I say?

02:22:12.560 --> 02:22:14.560
We don't have anything that fancy.

02:22:14.560 --> 02:22:19.560
This is why I came up with the other idea, which, you know, I'm emailing you all, I've

02:22:19.560 --> 02:22:24.560
I've set a date tentatively, and then I hope you all are capable of participating.

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:25.560
I'll have to pencil it in.

02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:26.560
Yes.

02:22:26.560 --> 02:22:29.560
Just pencil in the 29th of January.

02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:32.560
Wow, that happens to be my birthday weekend.

02:22:32.560 --> 02:22:33.560
Hi!

02:22:33.560 --> 02:22:36.560
Good planning on my part, huh?

02:22:36.560 --> 02:22:39.560
Potentially bad, but we'll see.

02:22:39.560 --> 02:22:40.560
Oh, I see.

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:41.560
Your birthday's more important.

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:44.560
Okay.

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.560
Well, I'll remember that.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:50.560
I'm only turning 28, you old fart, but it's still important.

02:22:55.560 --> 02:22:59.560
I think Travis just shot himself, ladies and gentlemen, live on air.

02:22:59.560 --> 02:23:00.560
No, um...

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:01.560
Oh, darn.

02:23:01.560 --> 02:23:03.560
Have you even told...

02:23:03.560 --> 02:23:06.560
No, it's just Texas. You get all sorts of gun noises out there.

02:23:06.560 --> 02:23:07.560
Oh, yeah.

02:23:07.560 --> 02:23:10.560
You forget we live in shit-kicking Texas.

02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:13.560
Have we even told them what?

02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:17.560
Well, I mean, I know Jess knows. I know you know. I know Jamie knows.

02:23:17.560 --> 02:23:21.560
Anybody else around knows about the little thing?

02:23:21.560 --> 02:23:23.560
Yeah, I do.

02:23:23.560 --> 02:23:25.560
Angel says yes, she does.

02:23:25.560 --> 02:23:26.560
Okay. Alright.

02:23:26.560 --> 02:23:29.560
And Ross knows, but he doesn't realize he knows.

02:23:29.560 --> 02:23:36.560
People know. They know. Anyway, I don't want to steer too off track here, but I do want to say, some folks in the chat room think you're pretty funny, Travis.

02:23:36.560 --> 02:23:39.560
You have some fans in the chat room already.

02:23:39.560 --> 02:23:46.440
yeah exactly that's what I said when I read it um if you guys think Travis is

02:23:46.440 --> 02:23:55.720
funny then you know what um you can listen to Travis's show it's under

02:23:55.720 --> 02:24:02.360
sedation live www.under station live.org it's where iguana girl and I got our

02:24:02.360 --> 02:24:06.600
start on internet radio and dark sacra to some extent as well I was number one

02:24:06.600 --> 02:24:12.600
most often guess. I know you weren't. Yes. Hey Rob? Yes. Hey, I just got one thing to

02:24:12.600 --> 02:24:19.160
say. Do you really think you can do all that bullshit you just said? I'm just trying to

02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:29.040
help you out buddy. What the hell are you doing? It was a weird echo. Go. Go. Stop that.

02:24:29.040 --> 02:24:31.040
I'm hanging up on you. No you're not!

02:24:31.040 --> 02:24:33.040
Use the force!

02:24:36.040 --> 02:24:38.040
Do you honestly want to get into that type of war with me?

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.040
You know you'll lose.

02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:46.040
You're gonna be in the process too.

02:24:46.040 --> 02:24:48.040
What?

02:24:48.040 --> 02:24:50.040
You're being mean to me in the process too.

02:24:50.040 --> 02:24:52.040
Turn your goddamn echo thing off!

02:24:52.040 --> 02:24:54.040
Hey, Rob.

02:24:54.040 --> 02:24:56.040
What?

02:24:59.040 --> 02:25:01.040
I can make everybody sound like chipmunks.

02:25:02.040 --> 02:25:03.040
I hate you.

02:25:07.040 --> 02:25:09.040
And then I can do 3D effects.

02:25:11.040 --> 02:25:17.040
See, this is what happens when I waste my money on toys that I don't need instead of, you know, getting stuff that my daughter really needs, like diapers.

02:25:17.040 --> 02:25:21.040
You know, it's kind of hard wrapping her up in brown paper bags.

02:25:21.040 --> 02:25:25.040
Let's say Walmart on the side.

02:25:25.040 --> 02:25:29.040
Actually, never mind, it won't go there.

02:25:29.040 --> 02:25:33.040
Anywho, don't forget, the 29th, if that's a conflict,

02:25:33.040 --> 02:25:37.040
let me know ahead of time, I will attempt to reschedule.

02:25:37.040 --> 02:25:41.040
But we need to test out how it's going to work in sound.

02:25:41.040 --> 02:25:45.040
Our people will be in touch with your people.

02:25:45.040 --> 02:25:47.040
Oh, get your people with my people?

02:25:47.040 --> 02:25:47.540
Yes.

02:25:47.540 --> 02:25:49.040
I have no people.

02:25:50.540 --> 02:25:52.040
You have little people?

02:25:55.040 --> 02:25:57.040
And Rob just has people that come around him going,

02:25:57.040 --> 02:25:58.540
Ooh, Rob's cool.

02:25:58.540 --> 02:26:01.540
Wanna touch him? I touched him. Wanna touch him? Ooh, I touched him.

02:26:03.040 --> 02:26:05.040
Who has a trash?

02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:08.040
What the hell is going on on your end?

02:26:08.040 --> 02:26:10.040
It sounds like you guys are like pushing some weird button.

02:26:10.040 --> 02:26:12.040
No, you've got the echo thing on.

02:26:12.040 --> 02:26:17.040
No, I don't. I turned off all my echo shit.

02:26:17.040 --> 02:26:20.040
I don't know what's going on.

02:26:20.040 --> 02:26:22.040
Oh, you scare me, man.

02:26:22.040 --> 02:26:24.040
Alright, thanks for calling in, Travis.

02:26:24.040 --> 02:26:25.040
I gotta go.

02:26:25.040 --> 02:26:26.040
Later.

02:26:26.040 --> 02:26:28.040
Bye, bye, bye.

02:26:28.040 --> 02:26:31.040
That was not on my end.

02:26:31.040 --> 02:26:34.040
Oh look, it's gone! Magically!

02:26:34.040 --> 02:26:37.040
I wonder how that happened.

02:26:37.040 --> 02:26:38.040
Oh no.

02:26:38.040 --> 02:26:40.040
I swear he does that just to piss us off.

02:26:40.040 --> 02:26:41.040
Yeah, I know.

02:26:41.040 --> 02:26:46.400
Alright, again, if you thought that was funny, I don't know why, but no, I'm kidding.

02:26:46.400 --> 02:26:50.560
Uh, understationlive.org, we do love Travis, and of course Jenna, we love Jenna even more.

02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:51.560
I mean, honestly.

02:26:51.560 --> 02:26:52.560
Because Jenna is hot.

02:26:52.560 --> 02:26:53.960
It's all about Jenna, really.

02:26:53.960 --> 02:26:54.960
Jenna is hot.

02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:55.960
Jenna is a hottie.

02:26:55.960 --> 02:26:56.960
Totally.

02:26:56.960 --> 02:26:57.960
It's all about Kira.

02:26:57.960 --> 02:26:58.960
Alright.

02:26:58.960 --> 02:27:00.960
And Kira's a cutie.

02:27:00.960 --> 02:27:01.960
Alright.

02:27:01.960 --> 02:27:05.840
If you want to find out what we were talking about there with the 29th, just head on over

02:27:05.840 --> 02:27:09.240
understationlive.org and there'll be more information soon.

02:27:09.240 --> 02:27:13.240
And then it involves us. So, you'll see.

02:27:13.240 --> 02:27:19.240
Exactly. Alright. Oh, I'm so glad that we get to go from that phone call into this next segment,

02:27:19.240 --> 02:27:24.240
because this next segment is a good one to follow that up with, and it's the FUs of the Week.

02:27:24.240 --> 02:27:29.240
It's our chance to rant a little bit about the things that have been pissing us off today, or all week long.

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:34.240
And, Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the Week every single week?

02:27:34.240 --> 02:27:36.240
Because of girls.

02:27:52.240 --> 02:27:54.240
My first F.U. of the week goes to your dryer.

02:27:55.240 --> 02:27:57.240
My second F.U. of the week goes towards the fatigue flu.

02:27:57.240 --> 02:28:06.440
flu for making me feel like crap another one goes to stress as you goes to

02:28:06.440 --> 02:28:12.920
distance money but I am very glad though that I am getting a raise with my new

02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.840
job which is probably gonna go to pay for bills humongous as you goes to

02:28:17.840 --> 02:28:25.360
GameStop incorporated if you goes toward the holidays in general for screwing

02:28:25.360 --> 02:28:34.640
with my head. Um, an F.U. goes toward stupid fuckers who drive really stupidly in the rain.

02:28:34.640 --> 02:28:39.680
Like, let's go, you know, there's one thing to drive five miles under the speed limit

02:28:39.680 --> 02:28:47.160
when you're, you know, in the rain. Five to ten miles, depending on the conditions, is

02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:53.200
smart. Thirty miles under the goddamn speed limit. Someone's going twenty. And, like,

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:58.840
Unless you, you know, if your car is so bad to the point where you cannot drive in the

02:28:58.840 --> 02:29:03.520
rain, you need to either get a new car or take the damn bus, okay?

02:29:03.520 --> 02:29:10.480
Um, it's, it was just one thing after, I'm a very easily frustrated driver though, so

02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:12.400
that could just be it, but.

02:29:12.400 --> 02:29:18.080
And another one goes toward people who have 20 items when it says 15 items or less in

02:29:18.080 --> 02:29:19.480
the damn express line.

02:29:19.480 --> 02:29:21.480
Okay, I'm done.

02:29:21.480 --> 02:29:27.160
Sorry about that, I got a little bit of Loki's music in there because I ran into the other

02:29:27.160 --> 02:29:28.160
room for a second there.

02:29:28.160 --> 02:29:30.080
I'll try and fix that in this situation.

02:29:30.080 --> 02:29:31.960
Now we will get to Loki's FUs of the Week.

02:29:31.960 --> 02:29:32.960
Here we go.

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:33.960
Yeah.

02:29:33.960 --> 02:29:34.960
I'm...

02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:37.960
God damn it, I don't have enough cord.

02:29:37.960 --> 02:29:41.840
Okay, I'll make this really quick because I'm cooking stuff.

02:29:41.840 --> 02:29:42.840
Let's see here.

02:29:42.840 --> 02:29:43.840
Fuck you, stupid drivers.

02:29:43.840 --> 02:29:47.000
Fuck you to the fact that I don't feel good right now.

02:29:47.000 --> 02:29:49.280
I think I caught someone's cold.

02:29:49.280 --> 02:29:53.200
And um, uh, let's see, fuck you to work because they're not paying me enough so I have to

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:58.560
get a new job, and I'm sure there's some other stuff I can't remember right now, I have a

02:29:58.560 --> 02:30:03.280
lot of stuff earlier, but hey, we're gonna keep it short, that's my gift to you.

02:30:03.280 --> 02:30:10.560
Alright!

02:30:10.560 --> 02:30:13.640
I like to give an F.U. to people that try to drive in the rain because it's obvious

02:30:13.640 --> 02:30:18.200
that nobody knows how to do it, because whenever I get out there and I try to drive and it's

02:30:18.200 --> 02:30:22.520
been raining just nobody knows that they're doing so I just what's wrong

02:30:22.520 --> 02:30:27.480
with people what is it about rain oh my god water falling from the sky I need to

02:30:27.480 --> 02:30:31.340
start cutting more people off and driving 25 under the speed limit or 25

02:30:31.340 --> 02:30:35.200
over the speed limit and coming up on your ass and you know refusing to pass

02:30:35.200 --> 02:30:41.340
you I hate people but I hate parking lots a big f you to Roseville and this

02:30:41.340 --> 02:30:47.960
place that I call Whitey Plaza because damn what a bunch of yuppies I just oh I

02:30:47.960 --> 02:30:54.360
I hate that place. Anyway, that's pretty much it. Otherwise, everything's pretty good, and I can't really complain a whole lot

02:30:54.360 --> 02:30:59.480
So we're gonna move on and going around. Let's start it off with who's got a mic over there jazz

02:31:01.600 --> 02:31:05.120
If you two people who do not signal when they merge

02:31:05.840 --> 02:31:13.400
And holy crap, I have never seen so many people do that here and try to cut you off. It is ridiculous. Damn

02:31:13.400 --> 02:31:20.400
Also, I view it as people who don't signal when they're making a left turn that isn't protected.

02:31:20.400 --> 02:31:28.400
Oh my god. People in Milpitas do this all the time. I'm trying to get out of a shopping center and it's raining, so it's hard enough to see what's going on.

02:31:28.400 --> 02:31:34.400
And people keep turning and turning and I can either go straight or left and I'm assuming they can too.

02:31:34.400 --> 02:31:38.400
I'm like, oh my god, what are they going to do? No one's signaling but oh my god, they're all turning.

02:31:38.400 --> 02:31:45.400
They're all turning, so I'm like, oh no, oh no, and finally they all go through and they all turn, and I'm like, fuck you all, and they just go in my merry way.

02:31:45.400 --> 02:31:54.400
Uh, I'll do FU to Taiken 5, because let's suck at it. Uh, yeah, that's about it.

02:31:54.400 --> 02:31:57.400
Alright, Islander!

02:31:57.400 --> 02:32:03.400
The only FU I can think of, really, is FU to my car doors for, like, not closing all the way and letting rainwater in.

02:32:03.400 --> 02:32:08.040

02:34:10.580 --> 02:34:14.580
I don't want to put up with your shit when I have to put up with the other retards on the road.

02:34:14.580 --> 02:34:19.580
F you to StepMania. Alpha24 was the most recent one that actually worked for me.

I'm going to refrain from comment

02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:49.740
Ram says F U M S depression and A D D. K Dash says F U to New Year's because I was

02:35:49.740 --> 02:35:56.480
all alone. Oh I'm sorry. Next time tune in to see what's going on with the internet radio

02:35:56.480 --> 02:36:04.060
because we're around sometimes on New Year's so I know what little concession. Jaded 2005

02:36:04.060 --> 02:36:09.540
says F U to people who think I know everything about computers when they can't work them.

02:36:09.540 --> 02:36:16.700
And lastly, BlackDevilerX says F you to going back to school tomorrow and F you to being

02:36:16.700 --> 02:36:19.380
jet lagged.

02:36:19.380 --> 02:36:23.560
Alright.

02:36:23.560 --> 02:36:25.940
Very ranty chat room there.

02:36:25.940 --> 02:36:26.940
What can I say?

02:36:26.940 --> 02:36:30.660
Alright, but they typically are.

02:36:30.660 --> 02:36:31.660
They're moody usually.

02:36:31.660 --> 02:36:35.820
Alright, we're going to go to a break and when we come back from this break, we are

02:36:35.820 --> 02:36:39.260
going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:36:39.260 --> 02:36:43.420
So you will have a chance to ask us just about anything you want. Send your questions in

02:36:43.420 --> 02:36:49.100
right now over private message to Sky and we'll take care of those. In the meantime,

02:36:49.100 --> 02:36:53.300
we were talking about home versions a little earlier so I thought maybe we could play some

02:36:53.300 --> 02:37:04.300
good songs that were on home version stuff. And I'll see if I can find it. All right.

02:37:04.300 --> 02:37:08.020
Loki says I have to play a certain song from 2DX so maybe we'll squeeze that in somewhere

02:37:08.020 --> 02:37:15.020
We will be back after this. We're going to start it off with a very popular track from DDR Extreme USA. We'll be back.

02:37:38.020 --> 02:37:40.020
So little hope, so little hope

02:37:40.020 --> 02:37:42.020
And I'm paying it out for love

02:37:42.020 --> 02:37:44.020
Yeah

02:37:44.020 --> 02:37:47.020
So little fear that makes me change

02:37:47.020 --> 02:37:49.020
But not so late

02:37:49.020 --> 02:37:51.020
A thousand years of Dallas Bay

02:37:51.020 --> 02:37:53.020
So emulate

02:37:53.020 --> 02:37:55.020
So emulate in the dark

02:37:55.020 --> 02:37:57.020
But I'm raised up for love, love

02:37:57.020 --> 02:37:59.020
Love

02:37:59.020 --> 02:38:02.020
Love, love, love

02:38:02.020 --> 02:38:04.020
So maybe love

02:38:04.020 --> 02:38:06.020
Love, love

02:38:06.020 --> 02:38:16.820
Similar love, similar love, similar love

02:38:16.820 --> 02:38:19.960
More than love, yeah, yeah

02:38:19.960 --> 02:38:23.340
Similar love, yeah, yeah

02:38:23.340 --> 02:38:30.720
Similar love, yeah, yeah

02:38:30.720 --> 02:38:35.800
Similar love, yeah

02:38:35.800 --> 02:38:56.800
Simply be love, is more than enough

02:39:05.800 --> 02:39:32.800
Holding on to all my fading memories

02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.300
Back to where it all began

02:39:36.300 --> 02:39:39.300
So much there I understand

02:39:39.300 --> 02:39:42.800
As I look now

02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:46.800
To a distance far away

02:39:46.800 --> 02:39:49.800
I will cross familiar lines

02:39:49.800 --> 02:39:52.800
Now I'm standing still in time

02:39:52.800 --> 02:39:56.300
Still in time

02:39:56.300 --> 02:39:59.800
Still in time

02:39:59.800 --> 02:40:06.800
Still in time, still in time

02:40:29.800 --> 02:40:53.800
I thought that I was gonna lose you, yeah Just have a one-on-one game, yeah

02:40:53.800 --> 02:40:56.800
I was born to be dead

02:40:56.800 --> 02:41:00.800
Just after one of these days, yeah

02:41:00.800 --> 02:41:03.800
Didn't know what to do

02:41:03.800 --> 02:41:06.800
Then there was you, yeah

02:41:06.800 --> 02:41:10.800
And baby, feeling right so wrong tonight

02:41:10.800 --> 02:41:14.800
And the stars came up in the sky

02:41:14.800 --> 02:41:18.800
The music you were playing really blew my mind

02:41:18.800 --> 02:41:22.300
Love is perfect

02:41:22.300 --> 02:41:26.800
Cause baby, when I heard you say

02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:30.300
Love was not an idea

02:41:30.300 --> 02:41:33.800
We were meant to be

02:41:33.800 --> 02:41:37.800
Love was not an idea

02:41:37.800 --> 02:41:41.800
Cause baby, when I heard you say

02:41:41.800 --> 02:41:45.800
Love was not an idea

02:41:45.800 --> 02:41:54.800
We were meant to be one

02:42:15.800 --> 02:42:22.800
It's a place you can hide, no care or frustration, leave the world behind

02:42:22.800 --> 02:42:30.800
Time to look to the light, do we find the right direction, you know we all can find

02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:34.800
Gonna take you through the light, turn your darkness into light

02:42:34.800 --> 02:42:38.800
Gonna find a better day, go and don't give up this way

02:42:38.800 --> 02:42:41.800
Gonna take you through the light, turn your darkness into light

02:43:11.800 --> 02:43:15.800
To the morning light, take it, na na na, take it

02:43:15.800 --> 02:43:20.800
To the morning light, to the break I say

02:43:22.800 --> 02:43:27.800
To the morning light, to the break I say

02:43:33.800 --> 02:43:38.800
Let's listen in on an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

02:43:38.800 --> 02:43:40.800
Do you want to be interviewed by Hollywood?

02:43:40.800 --> 02:43:42.800
No!

02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:44.800
Do we care what people think of us?

02:43:44.800 --> 02:43:46.800
No!

02:43:46.800 --> 02:43:48.800
Do we want people to kiss our ass?

02:43:48.800 --> 02:43:50.800
Yeah!

02:43:52.800 --> 02:43:58.800
Extreme Bamani Radio. That's us. Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:00.800 --> 02:44:02.800
Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:44:02.800 --> 02:44:04.800
We're kind of getting into the home stretch.

02:44:04.800 --> 02:44:07.800
But you know, some folks in the chat room were kind of asking tonight

02:44:07.800 --> 02:44:11.200
if we were going to do an Ask Orange Lounge segment, and I said, you know what, sure.

02:44:11.200 --> 02:44:14.640
It's been a few weeks since we've done Ask Orange Lounge, we did List List a couple weeks

02:44:14.640 --> 02:44:18.000
ago, we did Match Game and stuff, so we haven't done Ask Orange Lounge in a little while,

02:44:18.000 --> 02:44:21.440
and this is a segment where you can just basically ask us whatever you want.

02:44:21.440 --> 02:44:26.840
This is a great way to get us to actually talk about DDR if you want, or you could go

02:44:26.840 --> 02:44:30.980
out of left field, maybe you have a relationship problem you want to ask us about, and Jamie

02:44:30.980 --> 02:44:36.400
will give you straight up advice, really, and you may not want to hear it, but she'll

02:44:36.400 --> 02:44:40.360
give the honest answer but remember we love you that's why we're honest

02:44:40.360 --> 02:44:44.080
beginner alright so that being said

02:44:44.080 --> 02:44:48.080
let's get into it and we kick it off with me making an ass out of myself with

02:44:48.080 --> 02:44:55.080
a little opening theme song

02:44:55.920 --> 02:44:59.040
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question

02:44:59.040 --> 02:45:02.760
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio

02:45:02.760 --> 02:45:06.440
Is someone bound to ask a stupid dating question?

02:45:06.440 --> 02:45:10.120
I really hope not, because Dark Sakura will tear up a new butthole.

02:45:10.120 --> 02:45:17.120
Girls.

02:45:18.600 --> 02:45:21.880
What are you cooking over there, Loki? I have to ask. Loki's garlicky.

02:45:21.880 --> 02:45:25.280
Loki's cooking and it smells like garlic, and now all of a sudden I'm like, garlic.

02:45:25.280 --> 02:45:29.320
Oh, you doing the fried rice thing?

02:45:29.320 --> 02:45:33.520
oh his fried rice beautiful

02:45:33.520 --> 02:45:40.520
he learned from the Benihana chefs alright

02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:43.480
let's move on to question number one

02:45:43.480 --> 02:45:47.840
illusion this is a question from illusion brace yourself you knew this

02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:48.840
would be random

02:45:48.840 --> 02:45:53.440
if you throw a blender off of the Leaning Tower of Pisa

02:45:53.440 --> 02:45:57.800
and it lands in the Gulf of Mexico who did the wrapping in that one paranoia

02:45:57.800 --> 02:46:02.140
remixed Loki did. I think it was Paranoia Revolution or something. He said it would

02:46:02.140 --> 02:46:08.880
be the last one, if that helps any. So, Loki did this remix of Paranoia Revolution, and

02:46:08.880 --> 02:46:14.000
I guess it has... I remember this remix that Loki did a while back. It was... What the

02:46:14.000 --> 02:46:16.700
hell was the name of this, Loki? Can we tear you away from the kitchen for just a minute

02:46:16.700 --> 02:46:21.880
to ask you about this? The rapping? Yeah, what was the rapping in it from? That was

02:46:21.880 --> 02:46:27.540
from the song, actually, called The Revolution. It's by BT. I forget who he has that does

02:46:27.540 --> 02:46:32.020
rapping but he's like on a bunch of different albums and I think it said who

02:46:32.020 --> 02:46:37.740
his name was and I don't remember um Scotty D it's not Scotty D that's

02:46:37.740 --> 02:46:50.200
retarded I can't remember why you look for that let me play a clip from

02:46:50.200 --> 02:46:54.060
paranoia revolution and I but the rapping was towards the end right okay

02:46:54.060 --> 02:46:56.460
here here's a little clip of paranoia revolution so you know what the hell

02:46:56.460 --> 02:47:00.100
we're talking about. This is a Loki remix that you can find on his website, which is

02:47:00.100 --> 02:47:07.100
lowkeyfusion.tk still? Alright, here it is.

02:47:30.100 --> 02:47:46.500
Ooh, very sexy clip there from Paranoia Revolution, if you want to download the whole thing, it's

02:47:46.500 --> 02:47:51.380
loki-fusion.tk, and I've heard that clip, the revolution will be televised, I think

02:47:51.380 --> 02:47:56.380
I saw that on a bumper sticker once, that's what the guy said in one part there, alright,

02:47:56.380 --> 02:48:00.860
Alright, alright. While Loki does some more research on that, I'm going to go ahead and

02:48:00.860 --> 02:48:05.940
move on and you can come back to this question a little later, but it's from BT, basically,

02:48:05.940 --> 02:48:11.500
the short answer to your question. And Delusion would also like to add on a note, and I'm

02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:17.700
going to play some apologetic music to match his mood here on this note here, so I'll play

02:48:17.700 --> 02:48:26.020
some very solemn apologetic music here. Oh, no, Loki found it. God damn it, who the fuck

02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:35.020
What is this? It was in the song Mad Skills. Mike Cheka is the name of the song that was on his album Movement and Still Life.

02:48:35.020 --> 02:48:42.020
And they actually, I think, in the song he says who it is. Because, you know, they do that stupid, you know, shout out crap in it.

02:48:42.020 --> 02:48:49.020
So, I don't remember who he's partnered with, but it's the same guy that's on like all these albums.

02:48:49.020 --> 02:48:53.020
And Movement and Still Life would be a good one to find out who's in that.

02:48:53.020 --> 02:49:00.020
He doesn't give any credits anywhere else looking on Amazon, but no, nothing. So, um, oh well.

02:49:01.020 --> 02:49:09.020
Alright, let me get to another note from Illusion here. He would like to offer a formal apology.

02:49:10.020 --> 02:49:16.020
He says, I'm sorry, and I'm adding the crying noises because I know he's making them up.

02:49:16.020 --> 02:49:26.340
I'm sorry to everyone that I pissed off. I, too, will be going to community college, though

02:49:26.340 --> 02:49:31.960
I'm not too excited about it, nor would I be excited about any college. So, there you

02:49:31.960 --> 02:49:39.220
have it. A formal apology courtesy of Illusion. And there will be a replay of that apology

02:49:39.220 --> 02:49:44.940
next week on DDO Free Radio. In case you missed it or you want to tell your friends.

02:49:44.940 --> 02:49:51.940
Alright. K-Dash. Okay. K-Dash has a question about Beatmania 2DX.

02:49:51.940 --> 02:49:57.940
I'm planning on buying 2DX and I would like to know if anyone has any tips for me concerning whether I should get a flip-top

02:49:57.940 --> 02:50:02.940
or just a Japanese PlayStation 2. And the best place that I could purchase them from.

02:50:02.940 --> 02:50:05.940
Thank you. Japanese PS2 and CSX.

02:50:05.940 --> 02:50:10.940
I would also go with the Japanese PlayStation 2. The flip-tops are becoming a little more...

02:50:10.940 --> 02:50:14.740
Like, you know, like, if you'd asked us this two years ago, we would have said, straight

02:50:14.740 --> 02:50:18.660
up, do not trust the mods, go for a Japanese Playstation 2.

02:50:18.660 --> 02:50:22.420
They're a little better now, and I think there's more out there that you can kind of trust,

02:50:22.420 --> 02:50:26.300
but if you want the real thing, you want a collector's item, I would say just spend the

02:50:26.300 --> 02:50:28.840
extra money, get a PS2, because you're going to have to pay someone to install it, unless

02:50:28.840 --> 02:50:29.840
you do it, I mean, I don't know, maybe do it yourself.

02:50:29.840 --> 02:50:31.300
I'm talking about they're less expensive now.

02:50:31.300 --> 02:50:35.800
I mean, if you want one of the nude, skinny, tiny, and they have all the pretty colors,

02:50:35.800 --> 02:50:38.900
they have the Sakura colors, and the, Those are only those for the old model.

02:50:38.900 --> 02:50:39.900
Oh, okay.

02:50:39.900 --> 02:50:43.900
going to get a very brand new one, they're all going to be the slim style.

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:44.900
Alright.

02:50:44.900 --> 02:50:45.900
Islander.

02:50:45.900 --> 02:50:46.900
Yeah, no.

02:50:46.900 --> 02:50:51.020
I second the whole, you know, getting the Japanese PS2, you know, wholeheartedly.

02:50:51.020 --> 02:50:54.740
I don't trust the flip top still, I don't know why.

02:50:54.740 --> 02:51:02.700
And make sure when you buy it, you buy a Japanese PS2, not an Asian PS2.

02:51:02.700 --> 02:51:06.300
There is a difference, thank you.

02:51:06.300 --> 02:51:10.580
Even though it is cheaper and, you know, it looks like it's going to be a good deal for

02:51:10.580 --> 02:51:15.660
you, you have to, you actually have to use a converter because it is different power

02:51:15.660 --> 02:51:20.380
than the Japanese PS2, American PS2 voltage.

02:51:20.380 --> 02:51:25.980
So you end up putting that amount of money back into a good converter that you don't

02:51:25.980 --> 02:51:28.520
fry your PS2 with.

02:51:28.520 --> 02:51:29.520
Very good tip.

02:51:29.520 --> 02:51:31.620
A lot of something people don't think about sometimes.

02:51:31.620 --> 02:51:32.780
All right.

02:51:32.780 --> 02:51:36.660
So as far as that goes, it sounds like we kind of give the consensus, you know what,

02:51:36.660 --> 02:51:41.580
just go and get the Japanese Playstation 2, it's cheap and you won't regret it later.

02:51:41.580 --> 02:51:46.540
And was she asking what style to or did she just ask other tips or he, I'm sorry, I don't

02:51:46.540 --> 02:51:49.460
know if it's he or she, sorry.

02:51:49.460 --> 02:51:52.260
I'm not sure, so we'll just move on.

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:54.780
I would say as far as styles are concerned, because usually that's another question that

02:51:54.780 --> 02:51:56.900
goes along with it, is what style should I get.

02:51:56.900 --> 02:51:59.920
You really just have to evaluate the song list and look at the one that has the songs

02:51:59.920 --> 02:52:00.920
you want.

02:52:00.920 --> 02:52:04.240
beginners go though I wouldn't go with third or fourth if you're a beginner

02:52:04.240 --> 02:52:09.200
just because fifth and later had more beginner friendly modes in it overall I

02:52:09.200 --> 02:52:15.000
would say as far as song selection actually 8th style doesn't really have

02:52:15.000 --> 02:52:23.120
too many beginner friendly songs even in light 7 I would actually point people to

02:52:23.120 --> 02:52:26.320
fifth style let's say if you're gonna start anywhere start with this style has

02:52:26.320 --> 02:52:30.140
a lot more beginner friendly songs except the sixth style does have the

02:52:30.140 --> 02:52:36.340
beginner mode in it so it really depends I mean as far as song selection eight

02:52:36.340 --> 02:52:41.700
styles got a bajillion you know seven style has a whole bunch but I think

02:52:41.700 --> 02:52:46.460
overall you're best starting with fifth or sixth all right let's move on we got

02:52:46.460 --> 02:52:49.580
more questions here we want to get through before the show is over on dark

02:52:49.580 --> 02:52:52.180
night asked me this question earlier in the show and I wanted to get it out

02:52:52.180 --> 02:52:56.380
there we talked last week we talked a little bit about resolutions you don't

02:52:56.380 --> 02:53:00.060
plan on keeping this is kind of in those same veins so if you think about it

02:53:00.060 --> 02:53:04.500
a little bit of a different question, and, you know, just share if you want, you guys,

02:53:04.500 --> 02:53:12.300
but your goals for 2005, a goal for 2005, do you have any goals that you'd like to share?

02:53:12.300 --> 02:53:17.860
I'll start it off. I really want to get to Maniac mode this year, that's it. I gotta

02:53:17.860 --> 02:53:23.460
do it. And probably get better at 2DX as well, although I don't really know where I'm going

02:53:23.460 --> 02:53:29.820
with that, but let's just stick to DDR first. My goals for this year are very simple, and

02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:33.500
And actually, I met one before the year began, because my goal was to be in a new job.

02:53:33.500 --> 02:53:37.180
One of my resolutions I put in my life journal was to have a new job, and I actually got

02:53:37.180 --> 02:53:40.860
that right before the beginning of the year.

02:53:40.860 --> 02:53:43.660
Goal number one is to lose 50 pounds.

02:53:43.660 --> 02:53:48.100
Goal number two is to be enlisted in the Air Force or Army Reserves by the end of the year,

02:53:48.100 --> 02:53:53.620
at least to get my man over his anti-military thing.

02:53:53.620 --> 02:53:55.400
Anything you guys on the couch want to share?

02:53:55.400 --> 02:53:57.840
I have three of them.

02:53:57.840 --> 02:54:01.360
Two of them are most definitely going to happen, and the third one is going to take a lot more

02:54:01.360 --> 02:54:02.760
work.

02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:08.960
Goal number one, I'm going to graduate again this year, so basically my goal is to pass

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:14.920
my last class that I have to take in order to graduate, and hopefully convince my teacher

02:54:14.920 --> 02:54:18.560
that I don't have to be there for the day of the final, because otherwise I'll be stuck

02:54:18.560 --> 02:54:21.040
here instead of at E3.

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:22.040
Painful.

02:54:22.040 --> 02:54:23.040
Yeah.

02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:27.540
Second one is this is the year that I'm going to be getting out of debt, thankfully

02:54:28.320 --> 02:54:33.840
So I have to finish that out. I would anticipate it probably will be done by about August

02:54:33.840 --> 02:54:37.020
So I'll actually be 28 years old and completely debt-free

02:54:37.600 --> 02:54:42.420
Which is not something that most 28 year olds can say. Exactly. And I'll own my own car

02:54:43.000 --> 02:54:47.060
No, no making payments or anything like that and that's coming up in about two months

02:54:47.060 --> 02:54:54.060
And then my third, and probably the most important, and the one that's been the biggest problem for me,

02:54:54.060 --> 02:54:58.060
I'd like to lose another 80 pounds.

02:54:58.060 --> 02:55:06.060
Even if I don't lose the weight and just get down into size 12 or 14, I'd be ecstatic at that.

02:55:06.060 --> 02:55:16.060
But I have been working my butt off to try to lose the weight, and it's hard, especially with my conditions and everything.

02:55:16.060 --> 02:55:17.780
I'm gonna do it

02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:22.200
Good luck to you. We're here to support you orange launch radio. Anybody that you know is

02:55:22.800 --> 02:55:28.800
Trying to do that right now. Your friends are the best support you got for things like that. I think sometimes so

02:55:29.460 --> 02:55:34.340
And you can look to for encouragement and we definitely encourage those you guys that want to be more fit

02:55:34.340 --> 02:55:37.820
You know and especially Jamie is always telling you guys to go outside once in a while

02:55:38.220 --> 02:55:43.660
Even though you do have to sit indoors to listen to this show. It's Sunday night. Okay, that's that's that was the Lord's Day to rest

02:55:43.660 --> 02:55:47.740
so that's fine but you know go outside once in a while and get fit and that

02:55:47.740 --> 02:55:51.460
kind of goes along with my goals too is that I have a goal where I would just

02:55:51.460 --> 02:55:56.980
like to be more active and they say it takes 21 days to set a habit so I'm

02:55:56.980 --> 02:56:01.400
trying to going to get in the habit of working out more every day and whether

02:56:01.400 --> 02:56:05.500
that be that I get into riding a bike whether it be I get into lifting weights

02:56:05.500 --> 02:56:09.960
whether it be I play DDR and actually do play DDR every day at least it's

02:56:09.960 --> 02:56:14.100
something I want to get so where I'm doing like one fit activity a day so I

02:56:14.100 --> 02:56:19.680
can work off this little little tiny pooch I got a little pooch actually I do

02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:24.240
have a slight announcement to make okay for anyone who uses live journal I've

02:56:24.240 --> 02:56:28.360
made and I will actually I'm thinking of making this just a big support group I

02:56:28.360 --> 02:56:35.320
made a community called geek fit on live journal and I just made it this

02:56:35.320 --> 02:56:42.640
afternoon but just for anyone who wants tips, advice, just to share, you know, what

02:56:42.640 --> 02:56:46.240
you're doing, what's working for you. You don't even have to post every day but I

02:56:46.240 --> 02:56:50.200
would encourage people to make use of this that I've opened up for everybody.

02:56:50.200 --> 02:56:56.840
Just the livejournal.com slash community slash geekfit. G-E-E-K-F-I-T. Geekfit. I love

02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:00.640
the name. That's gonna be cool. So live journal is a great way of support. Also a

02:57:00.640 --> 02:57:04.480
lot of folks in our chat room are bringing up getupmove.com. Of course the

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:09.040
DDR fitness site, although getupmove.com, a little bit commercial because it's kind

02:57:09.040 --> 02:57:13.040
of a red octane theme, but I have kind of looked at, I've lurked on the forums a

02:57:13.040 --> 02:57:16.600
little bit, I think the forums are really cool. So I think if you want to find

02:57:16.600 --> 02:57:20.080
people in the same boat that are kind of using DDR as a way to get more active

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:23.520
and lose weight, I think the forums are really great help over there on

02:57:23.520 --> 02:57:29.920
getupmove.com, so check those out, definitely. Boy, okay, I guess we should

02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:32.280
move on or else we're gonna run out of showtime and not get to everybody's

02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:34.920
questions. We got to breeze through these last few questions here. Any other goals?

02:57:34.920 --> 02:57:39.320
Anybody want to get out there? Okay. I did, I do have some other goals and that

02:57:39.320 --> 02:57:45.360
would probably be just I want to, I'm kind of looking forward to 2006 where I

02:57:45.360 --> 02:57:50.200
want to buy a house in 2006 and not be a renter anymore. So I want to do one more

02:57:50.200 --> 02:57:53.520
year of renting something and I want to try and buy in 2006. That's going to take

02:57:53.520 --> 02:57:56.080
you know establishing more credit and things like that and being a good boy

02:57:56.080 --> 02:58:00.320
and things like that. And we'll see what happens with that. And then of course you

02:58:00.320 --> 02:58:03.720
know there's relationship goals too, but at the same time you can't, I don't think you

02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:06.500
can really set those kind of goals, because then you'll have these expectations that may

02:58:06.500 --> 02:58:11.240
not be met, you're just setting yourself up for disappointment. So, while the wish is

02:58:11.240 --> 02:58:18.220
there, it's not really a goal. What can you say? All right. Moving on, MPQ wants to know,

02:58:18.220 --> 02:58:26.460
why did it take my Popin' Music 5 soundtrack so long to arrive? Well, I imagine the mix

02:58:26.460 --> 02:58:30.940
This is several, or it's a couple years old now, so it's probably just hard to find.

02:58:30.940 --> 02:58:33.100
It's the holidays.

02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:34.100
That too?

02:58:34.100 --> 02:58:35.100
That makes sense to me.

02:58:35.100 --> 02:58:36.100
Yeah, there you go.

02:58:36.100 --> 02:58:37.100
It'll take a while.

02:58:37.100 --> 02:58:39.100
Bad weather, holding up packages.

02:58:39.100 --> 02:58:40.100
Exactly.

02:58:40.100 --> 02:58:41.100
Tsunamis.

02:58:41.100 --> 02:58:43.540
Everybody knows it's Al-Qaeda.

02:58:43.540 --> 02:58:45.540
Loki's ranting about Al-Qaeda?

02:58:45.540 --> 02:58:47.260
Alright.

02:58:47.260 --> 02:58:48.260
We'll see.

02:58:48.260 --> 02:58:54.780
Um, let's see, DJ Ronma S wants to know, did you all get everything that you wanted for

02:58:54.780 --> 02:58:55.780
Christmas?

02:58:55.780 --> 02:59:04.780
No, I did not, and I don't care because I can work on it this year if I really want to.

02:59:04.780 --> 02:59:07.780
Anything else?

02:59:07.780 --> 02:59:11.780
There were a couple of things I wanted, but I for the most part got what I wanted.

02:59:11.780 --> 02:59:17.780
Me personally, I didn't really have a list of demands, I just said I wanted to hang out with people more, and I did.

02:59:17.780 --> 02:59:21.780
I went to some pretty cool parties in December, so you know, it's all good.

02:59:21.780 --> 02:59:28.180
I don't really had I the one material thing I wanted I went out and I bought myself. I got it

02:59:28.180 --> 02:59:32.040
So the end my raw plutonium still in the mail they tell me

02:59:35.020 --> 02:59:37.020
Can't get your portal to hell did you?

02:59:39.720 --> 02:59:42.900
Final fantasy has kept me away from contacting the dead. I'm sorry

02:59:44.620 --> 02:59:45.540
Actually, it's funny

02:59:45.540 --> 02:59:47.420
I was watching something on TV

02:59:47.420 --> 02:59:54.420
Where I don't remember the show was because I just happened to pass it while Dan was watching where they were talking about your

02:59:54.700 --> 02:59:56.140
experiment

02:59:56.140 --> 02:59:59.900
As gonna be something that they were showing doing a news report on

03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:06.260
Yeah, that was it it was a movie and they were doing they were talking about the movie

03:00:07.020 --> 03:00:11.260
That was it. And I was like, oh, that's a that's a Loki's portal to hell

03:00:11.260 --> 03:00:18.260
I just want to be like you, you cool guy you.

03:00:18.260 --> 03:00:21.660
Alright I got to wrap this up so I'm sorry because I'm cutting a few people's questions

03:00:21.660 --> 03:00:22.660
off.

03:00:22.660 --> 03:00:23.660
I'm really sorry to you guys.

03:00:23.660 --> 03:00:24.660
We're going to have to make this the last question.

03:00:24.660 --> 03:00:28.620
Vidpowah wants to know, I recently picked up Tycho Drummaster, what do you guys think

03:00:28.620 --> 03:00:29.620
of this game?

03:00:29.620 --> 03:00:30.620
Any advice?

03:00:30.620 --> 03:00:31.620
Real quick.

03:00:31.620 --> 03:00:33.020
It makes my hands hurt.

03:00:33.020 --> 03:00:34.020
Freaking badass.

03:00:34.020 --> 03:00:35.180
I love the game.

03:00:35.180 --> 03:00:37.400
I love it too.

03:00:37.400 --> 03:00:40.180
I still can't get over Katamari on the rocks so you know what?

03:00:40.180 --> 03:00:49.020
I have yet to check out the US version, but my advice to you would be if you like the

03:00:49.020 --> 03:00:52.820
US version, there's about five of them in Japan that are just waiting for you to pick

03:00:52.820 --> 03:00:53.820
them up.

03:00:53.820 --> 03:00:57.500
Take breaks, otherwise you're going to kill your forearms.

03:00:57.500 --> 03:01:01.740
I had a friend, my friend that got Donkey Konga complained of the same thing from playing

03:01:01.740 --> 03:01:06.260
it too much, and even though it's a little bit different style still, I mean, as with

03:01:06.260 --> 03:01:10.500
any game that requires you to move motion, even DDR, take breaks, you know, take breaks

03:01:10.500 --> 03:01:14.020
once in a while. That's why you get a break stage on workout mode and things like that.

03:01:14.020 --> 03:01:20.580
So, any other advice? Okay. Well, that's going to bring that segment to a close. Thank you

03:01:20.580 --> 03:01:27.160
guys for the good questions tonight. We appreciate that. And we'll do more Ask Orange Lounge

03:01:27.160 --> 03:01:31.660
in a future week. Remember, we're here doing this show every Sunday night from 6.30 p.m.

03:01:31.660 --> 03:01:36.860
Pacific Standard Time to 930 p.m. Pacific Standard Time. Of course, this isn't the

03:01:36.860 --> 03:01:40.720
only show that happens. We have multiple live shows throughout the week. Monday

03:01:40.720 --> 03:01:45.120
night, Diversion, Bahmani remixes. Man, some good stuff. If you thought that

03:01:45.120 --> 03:01:47.860
Paranoia Revolution clip was cool, you should hear all the stuff that's on

03:01:47.860 --> 03:01:53.460
Monday night. It's awesome. Tuesday night, Dark Sakura, Pump Up the Volume. And also

03:01:53.460 --> 03:01:57.640
this Tuesday I will be playing the repeat. Yes, the one chance to catch the

03:01:57.640 --> 03:02:03.680
repeat on Orange Lounge Radio, you'll catch that this Tuesday, your one and only shot.

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:09.480
But DDR Freak Radio, I'm sure we'll play it several times this month, I'm assuming. Okay,

03:02:09.480 --> 03:02:15.320
I'm getting nods. All right, and Wednesday night we have the Old and Mold Orange Lounge

03:02:15.320 --> 03:02:19.120
Radio Rewinds, shows from like two years ago, we're playing for you guys. If you want to

03:02:19.120 --> 03:02:23.900
hear what it was like when we were talking about how cool DDR Max 2 was and why are they

03:02:23.900 --> 03:02:29.380
calling the next mix extreme. That's extremely lame and things like that. It's hilarious.

03:02:29.380 --> 03:02:33.980
And you can hear me for the first time ever, but who really cares, right?

03:02:33.980 --> 03:02:40.660
Right. And what else? You'll actually see a lot of faces two years ago. I mean, you're

03:02:40.660 --> 03:02:43.380
one of the few people that was here two years ago that's still here. A lot of folks that

03:02:43.380 --> 03:02:46.900
were here two years ago aren't here anymore, which is kind of sad. Except Logie, he's still

03:02:46.900 --> 03:02:50.060
here. He schmoozed his way onto the show.

03:02:50.060 --> 03:02:53.820
And see, when I was on the show, he was sitting on the floor. Now who's sitting on the floor?

03:02:53.820 --> 03:03:01.500
Alright, alright. Because it's his apartment now. Anyway, also Thursday night outside the

03:03:01.500 --> 03:03:06.020
box has been hitting some road bumps lately. I'm sorry you guys, it's just that Rice Princess

03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:10.080
and Lanky Style have had other commitments, so we're going to try and maybe play with

03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:13.260
that a little bit. Hopefully we can bring outside the box back this week. If not, we

03:03:13.260 --> 03:03:18.100
might kind of change the format a little bit and try something else. Keep your eyes on

03:03:18.100 --> 03:03:23.920
orangelaunchradio.com. Something exciting is coming very soon. Very soon. That's all

03:03:23.920 --> 03:03:29.260
I can say right now. Friday nights, DER Freak Radio, working together with us to bring you

03:03:29.260 --> 03:03:33.140
the Orange Launch Radio Rewind, 6 o'clock. If you missed this show, any part of it, or

03:03:33.140 --> 03:03:38.140
a previous week's show, tune in over at The Freak, 6 o'clock Pacific Standard Time. I

03:03:38.140 --> 03:03:41.340
think that's about all the whoring I needed to do tonight for all the various stuff we're

03:03:41.340 --> 03:03:46.820
involved with. Yes? Anything else? Anything? Any of our guests have anything they want

03:03:46.820 --> 03:03:53.020
Wanna plug? No? Think we hit it all? Alright. Go on, girl.

03:03:53.020 --> 03:03:57.260
When you're not listening to Orange Lounge, go listen to DDR3C radio. That is all.

03:03:57.260 --> 03:04:03.660
Yes. You know what? Honestly, just support internet radio in general. Just turn off your

03:04:03.660 --> 03:04:08.980
regular corporate commercially fed...and I know a lot of people bitch that Live 365 plays

03:04:08.980 --> 03:04:12.500
too many commercials, but you know what, guys? It is nothing compared to corporate radio.

03:04:12.500 --> 03:04:17.500
turn on your FCC regulated censored airwaves sometime and take a listen to the crap they

03:04:17.500 --> 03:04:19.740
have on there and then tell me live 365 sucks.

03:04:19.740 --> 03:04:27.080
I have some great news for everybody too. Also, G4, um, Tech TV or just G4 TV, the two

03:04:27.080 --> 03:04:34.260
girls on G4TechTV.com promised that they wouldn't suck this year. I know everybody's so enthusiastic

03:04:34.260 --> 03:04:37.540
because the channel's not gonna suck anymore. Because they said so.

03:04:37.540 --> 03:04:39.540
But what if you're one of their boyfriends?

03:04:39.540 --> 03:04:42.980
But they also promised to do some lesbian action on there.

03:04:42.980 --> 03:04:45.060
That was their promise.

03:04:45.060 --> 03:04:47.620
Oh, yeah, true.

03:04:47.620 --> 03:04:49.060
I will one-up that.

03:04:49.060 --> 03:04:51.660
This year, we will continue to not suck,

03:04:51.660 --> 03:04:54.100
and we will bring you a hot lesbian action at some point

03:04:54.100 --> 03:04:55.340
during the year.

03:04:55.340 --> 03:04:59.380
That gives us 360 days to work with here, so.

03:04:59.380 --> 03:05:01.860
At some point, we will bring you hot lesbian action.

03:05:01.860 --> 03:05:03.900
And maybe some hot gay action, too,

03:05:03.900 --> 03:05:08.180
for you folks that are into that.

03:05:08.180 --> 03:05:12.180
We'll not only give you one instance of lesbian action, we'll give you two!

03:05:12.180 --> 03:05:17.180
How's that? How do you like them apples, G4TV? Huh? Huh?

03:05:17.180 --> 03:05:25.180
Alright. Anyway, uh, also the email boxes are open. We have email. If you ever want to say hi to us in email, you have a suggestion, comment, send us email.

03:05:25.180 --> 03:05:33.180
It's Rob at Orangelandrado.com or Jamie at Orangelandrado.com or Loki at Orangelandrado.com

03:05:33.180 --> 03:05:54.180
Now, now folks, I know, I know that you guys, um, like to tell me that my penis is small, that my breasts need enlarging, but I'd like some actual mail, too, you know, other than these, you know, other things, and I don't, you know, have any problem with my sexual performance, so I don't need any of those pills, either, but thanks for the offers, anyways.

03:05:54.180 --> 03:06:01.180
Alright, we gotta go, I'm sorry guys, we're running over. Final thoughts, uh, let's hear it, uh, we'll start with Islander since he has a mic, uh, final thoughts.

03:06:01.180 --> 03:06:03.180
I know, it's all you, buddy.

03:06:03.180 --> 03:06:08.180
None at the time, I can't think of one. Hmm, come back to me.

03:06:08.180 --> 03:06:10.180
La Guana girl, final thought?

03:06:10.180 --> 03:06:11.180
My side hurts.

Feel better. Take drugs. Jazz.

03:06:15.180 --> 03:06:17.180

03:09:59.860 --> 03:10:03.380
Hey, Hey!

03:10:03.380 --> 03:10:29.620
Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.

03:10:29.620 --> 03:10:33.840
Alright guys, this is the part of the show called the After Birth.

03:10:33.840 --> 03:10:37.560
Now what I have to kind of put out there is that our After Birth segments are going to

03:10:37.560 --> 03:10:42.840
be changing a little bit in the future because of something else that we're doing and I can't

03:10:42.840 --> 03:10:46.480
spill the beans just yet, but trust me, you'll be cool with this once you find out.

03:10:46.480 --> 03:10:50.260
So our After Births are going to be a little bit shorter and just so you guys know, when

03:10:50.260 --> 03:10:55.720
our shows are over, you're going to be going back straight to the Orange Lawns Radio Bamani

03:10:55.720 --> 03:10:56.960
Music and More program.

03:10:56.960 --> 03:11:00.360
That does mean you get dumped from the stream, you're gonna have to reconnect in 30 seconds.

03:11:00.360 --> 03:11:01.640
But it's no big deal, right?

03:11:01.640 --> 03:11:05.040
You guys still love Orange Lounge, and we'll listen to it, right?

03:11:05.040 --> 03:11:06.040
No, they hate us.

03:11:06.040 --> 03:11:07.040
I know, they hate us.

03:11:07.040 --> 03:11:08.040
Ugh!

03:11:08.040 --> 03:11:09.040
I thought that was a good show tonight.

03:11:09.040 --> 03:11:10.040
It was a very good show.

03:11:10.040 --> 03:11:11.040
I think it was a very good show.

03:11:11.040 --> 03:11:15.840
I love it when Iguana Girl and Jazz comes in from out of town, and Islander's here,

03:11:15.840 --> 03:11:20.640
and Angel's here, of course, and Loki has food so he's happy.

03:11:20.640 --> 03:11:23.120
Loki, you look pretty pissed off at the beginning of the show.

03:11:23.120 --> 03:11:26.440
I think you tripped on something and I saw you just go into anger mode.

03:11:26.440 --> 03:11:32.180
what happened? I tripped on two sets of cords. First, set number one going from the cabinet

03:11:32.180 --> 03:11:38.360
to the chair, and set number two going from the table next to the cabinet to somewhere

03:11:38.360 --> 03:11:43.640
on towards the wall. It's like two trip wires that we have in here, and I hit them both.

03:11:43.640 --> 03:11:47.100
That and I had a fucking headache, and it seems to be going away now that I have food.

03:11:47.100 --> 03:11:53.460
I think it's probably because I didn't eat since 11, and when I did eat it at 11, it

03:11:53.460 --> 03:12:01.700
it was four-day-old twists. So, literally, my jaw was sore from chewing those twists.

03:12:01.700 --> 03:12:05.940
It's like, you know, if you work out, you know, while you can't move your arm, well,

03:12:05.940 --> 03:12:11.160
that was like my jaw. It sucked. But, so I made my fried rice thing, and I have enough

03:12:11.160 --> 03:12:14.880
now for the whole week, so I'm going to eat it.

03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:18.940
I'd like to comment in the chat room, there's still a few people in there over at www.orange.com

03:12:18.940 --> 03:12:23.380
in chat. Dark Knight says, dang, the studio cleared out fast, didn't it? Well, yeah, this

03:12:23.380 --> 03:12:27.020
is pretty typical where most of our guests take off during the closing credits there,

03:12:27.020 --> 03:12:30.540
just like a lot of our listeners do. Well, we understand it's kind of late for you guys

03:12:30.540 --> 03:12:34.260
out there, especially on the East Coast. It's, what, 1230 your time out there, so pretty

03:12:34.260 --> 03:12:41.340
late. But, you know, obviously, Goanna Girl's kind of hurting there a little bit, and Jazz

03:12:41.340 --> 03:12:45.700
had to drive back to the Bay tonight, so it's very typical where, you know, people just

03:12:45.700 --> 03:12:48.580
got to get somewhere else so it's kind of interesting with radio though

03:12:48.580 --> 03:12:53.580
sometimes you can't always tell people will run into the studio sometimes while

03:12:53.580 --> 03:12:58.140
the opening is playing and be in their seat right in time for the show to start

03:12:58.140 --> 03:13:02.300
and you know live TV and live other live radio programs work this exact same way

03:13:02.300 --> 03:13:06.180
so it's just kind of funny the illusion that would sometimes gives that we've

03:13:06.180 --> 03:13:09.260
been sitting here for you know a half hour waiting for the show to start no I

03:13:09.260 --> 03:13:13.660
don't think so but anyway we do appreciate you guys sitting through the

03:13:13.660 --> 03:13:18.480
show and sticking with us. Have a great one, you guys. We really support you guys and thank

03:13:18.480 --> 03:13:23.700
you guys for supporting us. What can I say? You guys have stuck with us through the holidays

03:13:23.700 --> 03:13:28.120
and everything. Don't forget, listen to our Bomani Music Amore program. We've got some

03:13:28.120 --> 03:13:33.240
exciting new things coming to you guys very soon. We're doing it for you guys because

03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:41.700
we love you. Except Loki, he hates you. We love you. This new thing we're doing somewhere

03:13:41.700 --> 03:13:47.580
involved needs to be the song girls just so everyone can suffer

03:13:47.580 --> 03:13:50.700
we'll see alright guys have a great night thank you for tuning in at this

03:13:50.700 --> 03:13:51.300
point

03:13:51.300 --> 03:13:54.540
you're gonna be released from the live stream which means you're gonna be dumped

03:13:54.540 --> 03:13:56.220
What you have to do is you have
