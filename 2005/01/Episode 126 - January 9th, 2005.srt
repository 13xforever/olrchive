00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:06,480
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

11
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,480
...muh...muh...cocky.

12
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:10,360
Just kidding.

13
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:13,160
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

14
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,160
In this episode...

15
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:20,640

18
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:44,900
We are live!

19
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:52,660
This is episode number 126 for this January the 9th of 2005.

20
00:05:52,660 --> 00:06:00,860
You're tuned into the B money scenes.

21
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,940
Most minty station of all things money.

22
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,180
My name is Rob Roberts.

23
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,500
You might know me as Sky.

24
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,940
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

25
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,860
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm,

26
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,660
say hello to Dark Sakura.

27
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:16,380
You know her, maybe ask Jamie Sommers.

28
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,580
I like fire.

29
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,460
Fire is very cool. I do like fire.

30
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,340
I watched Mr. Show today.

31
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:26,980
What have you set on fire this week, Jamie? Just out of curiosity.

32
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:27,740
Candles.

33
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,540
Oh, okay. They smelled like pears.

34
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,380
On something.

35
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,860
I actually spent the money this week.

36
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,980
Ooh, we're going to get into that, definitely, when we get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

37
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,780
You should light a pear on fire. I wonder what that would do.

38
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:44,500
it wouldn't catch fire because of the moisture in the pear

39
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:46,220
you catch the stem on fire maybe

40
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:50,180
well if you threw it in the fireplace that might be like a lot of fire where

41
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:52,780
the moisture wouldn't put it out

42
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:59,380
but not enough, it would still...

43
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:01,100
seriously

44
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,340
i'm full of good ideas here

45
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:06,260
we're going to have roasted pears with butter and cinnamon

46
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:09,540
today on Iron Chef, we're a battle

47
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Also joining us, the other co-hosts, you know him, the angry, the bitter, the tech-massa,

48
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Loki!

49
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,100
Alright.

50
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:28,300
And we never say his stage name, but it's Matt Blackman, by the way, just in case you're

51
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:29,300
curious.

52
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,300
Alright.

53
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,900
Um, also joining us tonight, we have one special guest, well actually we have two, but one

54
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:37,380
of them never talks, so we just don't acknowledge her.

55
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:43,900
have said stuff on this show before. Very rarely though. You need to give him the EBS,

56
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:51,900
the Evil Death Stare. I got the Evil Death Stare and the finger. Isn't that lovely? Uh

57
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:57,900
oh. Oh, two fingers. Oh, two fingers. You're going to hell. Yeah, I am. For a plethora

58
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:03,140
of reasons which I'll discuss later. Uh, anyway, say hello to the other, uh, special guests

59
00:08:03,140 --> 00:08:05,140
Still a DDR Angel.

60
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,140
Hello. Ah.

61
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:11,140
I almost killed myself with the cord. Ah!

62
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:16,140
Those that know her pretty well, though, know that she's actually DDR Devil.

63
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,140
Bastard, I am not.

64
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:24,140
Oh, great. There's the Devil right there in ferret form.

65
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:26,140
So, do I have a name yet?

66
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,140
Do you? I don't know. Do you have a name?

67
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,140
I don't know.

68
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,140
You tell me.

69
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,140
Just Angel.

70
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,020
Okay, it's just Angel, fine.

71
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,020
I don't have a label anymore.

72
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,020
Angel of the Morning.

73
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,320
I like Angel Devilman.

74
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,320
Or Deviled Angel.

75
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,140
I like those, you know, paradoxes.

76
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
Anyway.

77
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:47,100
Alright.

78
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,260
We got a fun show for you tonight.

79
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,260
Actually we don't.

80
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,740
We have a mediocre show, but it's packaged as a good show.

81
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:56,260
No, it's going to be a good show as always.

82
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,920
Lots of things to talk about.

83
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,140
Jamie mentioned there she's actually played some Bahmani this week so we got

84
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,600
to talk about that among other Bahmani things huge Bahmani news going on in the

85
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
scene this week we got to talk about this you know this is going to be big

86
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:15,320
and also we want to talk about the brand new orange lounge radio production

87
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,920
there's a brand new show you may not have even heard of this yet we're gonna

88
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,640
tell you guys all about it it's so cool all of that when we get back in this

89
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,640
It's called fun with butter.

90
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:27,640
That's right, it's fun with butter.

91
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,640
And we just take DDR Angel and we just douse her in butter and then cook her.

92
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,640
Ah shit, are you going to light me on fire?

93
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:45,640
Yes. Let's have DDR Angel hold the pears and then set it on fire. We're being very random tonight.

94
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Where'd my Black Mage light you on fire?

95
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:53,640
Alright, it's gonna be one of those shows, folks. One of those shows.

96
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:58,640
Alright, we'll talk about all that fun stuff when we come back from this break.

97
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:07,640
In this break, we're gonna feature music from 2DX, but Jamie requested that we play some 2DX songs that you don't normally hear, hear us play.

98
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,640
So, these are under-appreciated 2DX songs.

99
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:15,680
songs and we're going to start it off with a little ditty from slake called i'm for real

100
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,680
So we'll be back after this.

101
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,480
Reach way down into my soul

102
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
And you will see real love, I'm small

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

125
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:16,760
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

126
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:22,240
them in music gaming and video games that don't suck, and some that do.

127
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,840
Here we are on our 126th episode.

128
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,100
I'm just kind of watching our chat room over there, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

129
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Click on chat.

130
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,100
We've got a whole little group in there.

131
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:32,280
A little chatty bunch tonight.

132
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
It's very nice.

133
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:36,120
Good to see some folks chatting in there.

134
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,400
I guess the 2DX music was inspiring some talks there about 2DX clicks, and some people in

135
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:44,560
there kind of felt they don't fit in with the 2DX clicks.

136
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,240
it just me or I kind of feel what they're saying there's a lot of real

137
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,200
like elitist 2dx players out there I mean now I've always been one that says

138
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,040
you know just just play the damn game just have fun with a game that's why

139
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,920
they make it for the home you can play in the privacy your own home mostly

140
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,840
arcades don't even have the game anyway so you don't have to work be

141
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:05,400
intimidated or worry about anything but what's up with that why do people get

142
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:13,080
elitist over 2dx any ideas no Jamie any thoughts this because people have to

143
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:16,200
to have something to feel good about themselves if they suck at everything else in life, they

144
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,840
have to at least be good at 2DX, I don't know.

145
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,440
I know some good 2DX players that don't suck at life, they're very good at life, and they

146
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,240
just happen to be good at 2DX too, but some people, man, it's like, I don't know, instead

147
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:33,760
of having a humongous internet penis, they feel the need to have a humongous 2DX penis.

148
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,520
And this, you know, this could be a girl too, don't, you know. Although I actually don't

149
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,040
know a whole lot of girls that play 2DX. I know some, and some that are quite good, like

150
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:45,400
Jamie. Jamie plays 2DX. Angel plays 2DX. I am not good.

151
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,100
But see why, now see that's the whole thing right there is that you feel like

152
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:50,920
you are

153
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:57,280
you're not good compared to what? Compared to other people in general?

154
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:00,360
You know what, any old person walking up the street if you were to play 2DX for

155
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,160
that person they'd probably go wow

156
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,000
she hitting a lot of buttons. It's relative but I'm

157
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,720
you know my skill has depreciated a bit at the game

158
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,400
just with lack of practice. So is mine, oh my gosh.

159
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,400
Tell you what, you know, if you don't keep practicing these music games, these

160
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:20,560
rhythm beat games, you'll lose it. Boy, do you ever.

161
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:26,080
It's sad. Alright, anyway, let's not get too off-topic because we've got to start

162
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,320
off tonight's show as we start off

163
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,320
every week's show playing a little game and that game is How Was Your Week?

164
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:34,560
How Was Your Day? Dark Sakura, how was your week? How was your day?

165
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:39,560
I played some 2DX. Well, then you can't beat that out of practice.

166
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:46,760
Well, just a little, but, um, my week's been, it's been a really fucked up week, because

167
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:51,680
this is my second to last week at my job, because I got promoted, going back to where

168
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:52,680
I was before.

169
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:53,680
Congratulations.

170
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,680
Thank you.

171
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,680
Get a nice raise out of it, too.

172
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
All right, raises rock.

173
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:57,680
But, um...

174
00:18:57,680 --> 00:19:02,280
Now you can buy more useless video game garbage you'll only play one time.

175
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,160
This money's gonna save it for my house.

176
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,160
Oh, that's very good.

177
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:08,680
So you can have more places to keep all your useless video games.

178
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:13,680
None of your stuff is useless, though, Jamie. I'm talking in general, in general.

179
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:18,680
I would never make fun of the Dark Sacra Museum of Video Gaming.

180
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:23,680
The museum is right, although it's all in boxes, most of the places. We're going to be getting rid of a lot of our toys soon.

181
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:28,680
Are you going to put it on eBay? No, we're probably just going to give them away to some charity or something.

182
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:33,680
I'm charity. Okay, do you want a bunch of Ronin Warriors and Exo Squad toys?

183
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:34,680
I would never play with them.

184
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:41,680
They re-released a bunch of the Madcross toys as ExoSquad toys, and we have them.

185
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,720
We should give them away as prizes on the show.

186
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,720
Win!

187
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,720
Oh, I did!

188
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:46,720
I did manage to get more...

189
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,720
Win Jamie's crap.

190
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,720
More V-Rares.

191
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,720
Oh, cool.

192
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:53,880
More copies of the EX and UltraMix V-Rares.

193
00:19:53,880 --> 00:20:01,520
So I have three of each, and may be doing something with those as far as prize-related

194
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:02,520
things.

195
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,520
Alright.

196
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:10,560
Um, excuse me, I've also had like this burning spot at the back of my throat is just like a little rough spot

197
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,840
So my voice has been kind of all day. I saw the grudge again

198
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,920
How was that in a theater? Well, it would have been great except for the morons talking behind us

199
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,040
So my friend turns around this is at the sunrise theater. She says you're gonna beat you in the head

200
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,920
That was almost like my experience. I went and saw the grudge and there was

201
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,920
This is right at the beginning of the movie.

202
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,920
Oh no, this was towards the end when I saw it.

203
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,920
And there was this guy, this jock guy sitting in the back going,

204
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,920
EEEHHH

205
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,920
And I turn around and go,

206
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:42,920
Will the guy with the little penis in the back row please shut up?

207
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,920
Well there was this one kid that just started belching in the last half of the movie.

208
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:50,920
I'm like, wow, it must be special to be able to burp in a movie.

209
00:20:50,920 --> 00:20:52,920
Only retards do that.

210
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,920
And so he stopped.

211
00:20:54,920 --> 00:21:01,560
just a little his mom was there too so I felt like saying making a comment about

212
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:08,920
how she raised her children isn't your mother proud of you now but anyway it's

213
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:14,080
just been a very weird week and like Friday was also my boss's boss who is

214
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:21,560
the AVP in our department her last day and we just ended up talking about stuff

215
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:27,960
in general about how last days rock about our opinion of certain people you

216
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,640
know and just in general and I hardly touched the phone I took like 20 calls

217
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:38,360
all day I ate carrot cake and I did body sculpting for the first time on Tuesday

218
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,760
and I was so sore but I was like mom I'm gonna go spin the next day gonna be a

219
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:47,400
good little workout you know work out a holic oh my god I was in such pain I

220
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,400
I didn't go Thursday. I didn't go Friday. I didn't go yesterday. I did crap.

221
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,400
That's like my DDR diet. I played like four days in a row and then I didn't play for five. And then I played yesterday.

222
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I played PSO last night. And on the internet. And went to TapX.

223
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I went to the new TapX on um...

224
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
There's a new TapX?

225
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:12,400
HAL. No, on HAL.

226
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:16,400
It intersects with HAL off of Fair Oaks. Off Fair Oaks, actually.

227
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,900
Oh, I didn't even know there was a new one.

228
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,900
It's tucked away back there, but they have fish balls on the menu.

229
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,900
And they have real spring rolls, like the Vietnamese style spring rolls.

230
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:23,400
Yeah.

231
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,900
With the thin wraps.

232
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,900
For those that don't have Tap-X, what's Tap-X, for those that may not know?

233
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,900
Tapioca Express.

234
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:36,400
It's basically, you can get all kinds of tea, juices, and milk tea, coffee, with these little

235
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,900
gooey tapioca pearls on the bottom.

236
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,900
They're so good.

237
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
And it's the gooey tapioca pearls that make all the difference.

238
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:45,500
difference now now I know a lot of you guys might be all like ew tapioca because

239
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,580
I had tapioca pudding once it was nasty nasty nothing like it nothing like it

240
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:53,500
it's good it's like look online for tapioca express it's like you're

241
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:58,380
drinking and then suddenly have balls in your mouth and it tastes yummy so what

242
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:05,960
is it like to have balls in your mouth chewy really in fact angels got some

243
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:10,180
balls sticky and squishy angels got some balls mints with her right now I'll have

244
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:15,340
to put these on cam so I can put angels balls in my mouth which I think I'm

245
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:20,780
gonna do right now I'm gonna look politely in the other direction hey look

246
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:31,580
ferret anything else you want to share about your week your day um no fine all

247
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:37,900
righty let's move on to Loki Loki how was your week how was your day Loki my

248
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:45,020
week is all right. I've been buying stuff. Stuff for my project, my other project.

249
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:48,300
You know, because you know all the other projects I start without finishing the

250
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:51,940
other ones. But this one should be done pretty quick though, because it's a small

251
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:57,940
one, so. But everything to build my micro ITX PC that's gonna be inside of an

252
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:04,060
Xbox, that's gonna be for our roadshows. So I have it all. Right now most of it's

253
00:24:04,060 --> 00:24:10,020
stacked on that table right there. But everything else is still coming in for it. The only thing

254
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:15,300
I have left to purchase on it is RAM and then, you know, any other peripherals that plug

255
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:21,860
into it. And then, you know, any other miscellaneous case modding crap I want to do to it. So I

256
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:28,740
have that. And then, this week I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy and that type of stuff.

257
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:34,000
Also been playing a lot of the guy game, actually, which is quite funny, because it's a fun trivia

258
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:40,900
with boobies in it. And, um, let's see what else. Oh, just, um, you know, watched a few

259
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:49,440
movies and that kind of thing. Overall, pretty easy week. And, um, yeah, that's all that's

260
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:58,440
pretty much been going on. Just that kind of stuff.

261
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:10,440
Alright, and my week and my day was, um, okay, I guess. I had a very lazy day. I've had a very lazy weekend, come to think of it. I haven't really done crap this weekend. I played a lot of Final Fantasy, that's for sure.

262
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,440
Um, whatever.

263
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:20,440
That's alright, we've sucked DDR Angel into our little addiction, and soon you will be next. Mwahahaha.

264
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:25,440
Okay, I tried that little addiction. You know what? It was crap. So I stopped playing.

265
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,440
As long as you didn't ditch us for World of Warcraft.

266
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,440
Should we tell her about the character problem?

267
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Oops.

268
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:37,440
Anyway, let's see. What else was I going to say?

269
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,440
I don't remember. Final Fantasy XI has pretty much been my whole week.

270
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:44,440
No, I went out and saw some old high school friends last night, which was good.

271
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:47,440
You know, it's good to see those people that you actually liked in high school.

272
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,440
You know, there probably wasn't many if you're like me.

273
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:53,440
And I hung out with them last night. And then we went back to my friend's house and played Halo.

274
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:57,620
Because I had really played Halo 2 in quite some time since I got the game

275
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,580
It's like I got the game then I played online for like two weeks and then I got sick of dying a lot

276
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:08,340
So I went back. That's the best part. Well, not when you're the one that's dying

277
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:11,820
When you're killing other people, it's okay, but I was the one that kept dying

278
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,460
So, I don't know. I just went back into Final Fantasy 11 where I don't die as much

279
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:21,900
But I got to play Halo 2 last night and I forgot that it actually can be a lot of fun when you're killing your friends

280
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:36,900
So, I need to, like, have a Halo 2 night or something where I set aside a night and play Halo 2 because it's much more fun to play with your friends than it is to play strangers on Xbox Live who are, like, a gazillion times better than you are and just get on there and say,

281
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:46,900
I'm gonna shoot you down, faggot! I'm gonna kill you! Nigga, I'm the best one at this game!

282
00:26:46,900 --> 00:26:50,900
And I swear, people on Xbox Live, they talk just like that. I'm not even exaggerating.

283
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,900
So, if you're offended by what I said, just go on Xbox Live, it's worse.

284
00:26:55,900 --> 00:27:03,900
Anyway, what else is going on? I don't know. I was kind of hoping to do a little bit of traveling this weekend, but that didn't happen.

285
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:08,980
But next weekend is a three day weekend, so I don't know if it's going to be a drunk show

286
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:11,980
Sunday night or if I'm going to go out after the show next Sunday.

287
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:12,980
So that's a look forward to.

288
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,500
I'll drink if someone can get me home.

289
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Let's see.

290
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,500
We'll have to see what we can do.

291
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,740
But it's a three day weekend for me next week.

292
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,980
I'm playing hooky on Friday too.

293
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:21,140
Our work celebrates Martin Luther King Day.

294
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
So we get it off.

295
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,140
It's pretty cool.

296
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:26,580
Actually, speaking of that, if I can add one more thing?

297
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,580
Sure.

298
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:29,980
I'm going to the Skywalker Ranch on Friday.

299
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
What for?

300
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,980
My friend works for Lucas Arts.

301
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:37,980
So I'm going to do school stuff that morning. I'm playing hooky anyway on Friday, on my last day.

302
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:40,980
And we're going to the Skywalker Ranch for lunch.

303
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,980
You should, um, take some business cards.

304
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,980
Get me some business cards.

305
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:46,980
We can find some, alright. Anyway.

306
00:27:46,980 --> 00:27:48,980
Sorry, I just wanted to throw that in.

307
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:50,980
Whoring out Orange Lounge Radio everywhere we can.

308
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:55,980
Um, I guess that's all I really have to say about my week and my day, and not a whole lot.

309
00:27:55,980 --> 00:28:00,980
I did see some movies, um, I saw that movie Finding Neverland, which is kind of like an artsy film that's up for Golden Globes.

310
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:04,980
Very good. Very good film. If you like Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.

311
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Alright, that's it. Enough of me, I'm boring. Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

312
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:15,980
I'm even more boring, so there. Um, excuse me. Uh, let's see.

313
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:22,980
Well, I guess for the gaggy part of my week, because I know you guys are all going to gag and go,

317
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:54,460
I'm taking a lot more classes than I am.

318
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:55,460
How many classes are you taking?

319
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Three.

320
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:57,460
How many units?

321
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,460
Three.

322
00:28:58,460 --> 00:28:59,460
Because there are only one unit classes each.

323
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,460
Oh.

324
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:01,460
Okay.

325
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,460
I'm taking four three-unit classes.

326
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:03,460
Ow.

327
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,460
See?

328
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,460
Well, no one's a two.

329
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:06,460
Well, yeah, it's not my fault.

330
00:29:06,460 --> 00:29:07,460
So I'm going 11 units.

331
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:08,460
It's not my fault.

332
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,460
I'm working full-time.

333
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,460
Yeah.

334
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,460
I got that, too.

335
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
So.

336
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Hm?

337
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
I got that, too.

338
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,460
Yeah.

339
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:19,460
Well, I've got work, too, and all that stuff.

340
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:27,260
Other than that, I didn't really do much this week, so I'm more boring than Rob is.

341
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,580
As if that's possible.

342
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:34,140
Oh, I forgot to say, one other thing I did is that I went to the book store, Borders

343
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,980
Books, and I got a book about starting your own business.

344
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:37,980
You can read?

345
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,980
Amazingly enough, I can.

346
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:44,620
I thought that if you were like, you know, a corporate trainer, you couldn't read and

347
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:45,620
had bad grammar.

348
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,620
Very funny.

349
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:49,300
Very funny.

350
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,420
You know, well I have horrible handwriting so whenever I write on the board, for those

351
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:56,980
that don't know my day job is I'm a corporate trainer, and when I write on the board it's

352
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,980
very yucky.

353
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,820
That's why I like to use PowerPoint.

354
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:05,180
It was very much a tease because I have known some where I work who have the worst grammar

355
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,180
ever.

356
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,140
I am the best corporate trainer you'll ever have.

357
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,140
You are the best.

358
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,140
You should come work where I work.

359
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:12,140
Well, not really.

360
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:17,340
If you give me a job making what I'm going to be making in my new position, sure.

361
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,580
Everybody should come work where I work, except I'm not going to tell you where I work because

362
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,460
I don't need any more stalkers.

363
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:28,860
Anyway, oh yeah, so I got the book on starting your own business so that, you know, because

364
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,420
we're thinking about with Orange Lounge Radio, we're thinking about it, we're thinking about

365
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:35,380
it, actually making this legit.

366
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,100
We've been doing it for what, two and a half years now?

367
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:39,620
I think it's about time to make this legit.

368
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:48,660
always been in the business sex you up on that note I think we're gonna go to a

369
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:53,580
break and when we come back from this break I know we got a list list we want

370
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:57,780
to do tonight I know we've got something that new project we want to plug for

371
00:30:57,780 --> 00:31:00,820
those that haven't figured it out we got a cage match we want to do we got big

372
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:05,300
DDR news very full plate for us when we come back in this break I thought we

373
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:10,340
do some poppy DDR music like some DDR poppy music starting it off with one of

374
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:14,260
the most poppy songs of all Dark Knight wanted to dedicate this to his friend

375
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:19,260
who's having a rough week so I'm gonna do that for him because we here at

376
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Orange Lawns Radio. We care. We care. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lawns Radio.

377
00:31:49,260 --> 00:32:01,260
I need your love in every way And I feel this every day

378
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Cause I have too many tears To fall in love again

379
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Now I am walking around In this side of the town

380
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:15,260
I just can't hide away How can I look in your eyes

381
00:32:45,260 --> 00:33:01,220
I made a My Bad there, that was actually for DJ Rama S's friend, not Dark Knight's friend,

382
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,460
although maybe Dark Knight wanted to hear it too, I have no idea, but as you can tell,

383
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:07,860
I usually get too many private messages during the show, so I screwed up.

384
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:08,360
My bad

385
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,860
Baby, stay with me tonight

386
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,860
Oh, yeah

00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:46,860
Oh, test me, baby

388
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:52,860
Oh, yeah

389
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Let me find out

390
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:56,860
Watch your glasses last

391
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:57,860
Make a passion dance

392
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Your body jam

393
00:33:58,860 --> 00:33:59,860
Felt so cute

394
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:00,860
Come on, now I've got my mind

395
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:01,860
To do what I said to you

396
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:02,860
So tonight

397
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,860
Move your body to the bright

398
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:04,860
Imagine

399
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Up there on your chest

400
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:06,860
On your lower

401
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,860
You know I'm not so bad

402
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,860
That's my bad and I'm united

403
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:14,860
And the rest is dependent on you

404
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,860
Come close to me and we'll be united

405
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:21,860
You will see, it's all so true

406
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,860
That's my bad and I'm not faking

407
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,860
Don't take less when you can't get it all

408
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:31,860
Just hold me tight, what you're giving I'm taking

409
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:36,860
Baby, stay with me tonight, alright

410
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:42,260
Carried away by a moonlight, shed a chance to look in the riddle of a Saturday night

411
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:48,860
Far away on the other side, she was caught in the middle of a different flight

412
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:51,860
And she couldn't find how to push through

413
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,860
A dream that was full in the evening

414
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:59,860
Carried away by a moonlight, shed a chance to look

415
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:05,860
Sore and breathing, carried away by a moonlight shadow

416
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:12,860
She saw what the feeling went and found, far away on the other side

417
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:19,860
She was shot six times by a man who ran, and she couldn't find how to push through

418
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:26,860
I said, I said, I prayed, I need you in heaven, one day

419
00:37:26,860 --> 00:37:53,740
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

420
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:58,020
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

421
00:37:58,020 --> 00:38:03,220
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

422
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:08,980
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 126.

423
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,540
Yeah, I know.

424
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:11,860
I can't believe we've been doing it that long either.

425
00:38:11,860 --> 00:38:15,540
Anyway, we have been doing this quite a while,

426
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:18,660
but there's always new stuff cooking up over at Orange Lounge Radio.

427
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,140
And we have a brand new thing.

428
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,220
It just launched earlier this week, but we

429
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:26,220
know a lot of you guys don't really pay attention to anything we do outside of

430
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:30,020
this Sunday show so we want to let you guys know there's actually a brand new

431
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:35,500
show and one of the most common requests we get here on Orange Lounge Radio is

432
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:42,140
can we download your show and we to that we say no you can't it's too the files

433
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,380
are too big how does it feel to want yeah basically a the files are too big

434
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,020
be you know we want people to listen live and a horse of our ratings and see

435
00:38:50,020 --> 00:38:53,580
you can always catch the rewinds on DDR for your radio Fridays at 6. Whatever. So,

436
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:57,100
that, you know, it's just not happening right now anyway. I can't say it's never

437
00:38:57,100 --> 00:39:01,500
gonna happen, but just right at this time it's not happening. But, we decided, we

438
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:04,820
thought, well, let's give them something they can download. And there's this new

439
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:08,660
technology out there called podcasting. For those of you guys that haven't heard

440
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,900
about this, you got to check out a site such as iPoder.org. That's not Potter as

441
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:22,300
and Harry Potter, that's podder, p-o-d-d-e-r, ipodder.org, what else, what about podcasting.net,

442
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,900
what are the other big sites, I can't even think of them, there's so many, podcastally.com,

443
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:32,040
I think is another one. Do you have to have an iPod to hear this show? No. Do you have

444
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:36,020
to have a live 365 account or do you have to listen to the station live to hear this

445
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:40,140
show? No. It's something you download onto your computer. Do you have to have broadband

446
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,960
to hear the show, no, it's just going to be a little slower for you. So check out

447
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:47,760
on our website, there's a new feature over on the left side, it's called Orange

448
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:53,880
Lounge Radio To Go, and it's basically a brand new, I don't know, 15 to 25 minute

449
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,700
show. It's a mini show, but it's something that's intended for you to

450
00:39:57,700 --> 00:40:01,160
download every week, and for those of you guys that do have some type of portable

451
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:06,520
media player, such as an iPod, the whole reason it's called podcasting is because

452
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:12,240
iPod is the most popular form of this. But if you have any portable media player, really,

453
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:16,420
what this is designed to do is that you can subscribe to the Orange Launch Radio Podcast

454
00:40:16,420 --> 00:40:21,580
and then just keep checking it. Have your iPod or program check every week or so or

455
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:27,120
check every day. And every Monday or so, you're gonna see a new show from us. And if you have

456
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,280
a media player, it'll hook right up to your media player so that you'll have a new show

457
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:35,720
to listen to for that week. So it's pretty cool. You gotta check it out. There's already

458
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:39,560
an episode up there for grabs if you want to subscribe. I know a few of you guys have

459
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:43,280
been having problems getting the most recent episode. We're hoping that when we put up

460
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:48,540
a new episode, it's going to fix all that, so just stay tuned. Go ahead, subscribe to

461
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:53,740
it and keep checking. There should be a new episode up tomorrow, if not late, late tonight

462
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:58,580
possibly, but there is one already there. We taped a show last week and it got put up

463
00:40:58,580 --> 00:41:02,700
there and a lot of folks have already been downloading it. In fact, I think we might

464
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:07,020
have some new folks listening to this show who actually heard the podcast

465
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,140
first because the podcast is such a huge new technology that's out there a lot of

466
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,900
people are just downloading new shows as they can find it and if you came all

467
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:18,900
this way to listen to our live show hey thanks a bunch stop on in the chat room

468
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:24,060
and let us know you enjoyed it www.orangelandtrader.com click on chat

469
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:29,900
and yes it is a show we plan to do every week if not more we might actually I

470
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:35,340
I mean, when we go on the road, such as, oh, I don't know, E3, we might be able to use

471
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:40,940
this technology to do updates every day, little shows, little interviews from E3, so stay

472
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:41,940
tuned.

473
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:42,940
It's very cool.

474
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:43,940
It'll also have the infernal machine.

475
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:44,940
Mm-hmm.

476
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:52,140
So, yeah, that, so, wow, lots of stuff there.

477
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,620
The podcast is an exciting feature.

478
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,540
Remember, all you gotta do is subscribe, and you're set.

479
00:41:58,540 --> 00:42:02,700
Now of course all the chat room is saying the next step is Orange Lounge Radio Television

480
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:07,400
and I want my OLR TV, which is kind of funny, because when you think about it, I don't know

481
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:11,220
if you knew this, but do you know who one of the driving forces behind podcasting was?

482
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:14,380
One of the people that kind of came up with the idea with some friends?

483
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:18,140
Adam Curry, the MTV VJ from years ago.

484
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,360
Dude, he was cool.

485
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:20,360
He was awesome.

486
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:27,140
And now he's got this thing, which just makes him even more cool, so, you know, it's awesome.

487
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:31,420
know it would be like ultimately cool if like it were also sponsored by Martha

488
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:38,300
Quinn then I would be happy. And instead of being hosted by us we'll just have

489
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:42,780
Julie Brown and what we need what we need to do something when we have our TV

490
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:47,460
show we need like the remote control segment complete with those chairs

491
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:52,100
seriously remote control that could be like our game shows at the match game

492
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:54,820
segment or something. If you get the answer wrong.

493
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:59,620
Nah nah nah nah. Nah nah nah nah. God, I remember when MTV was cool.

494
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:03,300
I know, now they suck on ice. But the weird thing is, like, how old were

495
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,340
we when MTV was cool? Like, maybe 12? Around that age?

496
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:12,900
I think the time when MTV was cool was when I was a senior in high school, so I was 18.

497
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:17,080
Was probably when these guys like Adam Curry and Martha Quinn and them were still on the

498
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:21,740
air, if we're showing our age a little bit. It was right when, you know, the real world

499
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:26,540
was cool when it first came out, it was kind of a neat concept. When it took over the entirety

500
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:32,900
of MTV, uh-uh. You know, I took watch of my remote control, but the thing is that my senior

501
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:38,420
year of high school was spent on two pots of coffee every night watching the good cast

502
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:42,780
of Saturday Night Live. You know, back when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and all them were

503
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:43,780
on...

504
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:47,580
Now, some would argue with you that this old 75 cast with Bill Murray and Gilda Radner...

505
00:43:47,580 --> 00:43:51,260
Well, they were great too, but I mean like as far as the more modern era of Saturday

506
00:43:51,260 --> 00:43:56,780
live and then I would probably turn on 120 minutes and have bangers ball my

507
00:43:56,780 --> 00:44:00,340
god look at this our chat room right now you got to see this over in orange

508
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:03,300
launch radio.com click on chat they're practically creating this whole

509
00:44:03,300 --> 00:44:07,540
treatment for an orange launch radio TV show that could be on MTV they're saying

510
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:13,220
all the cage match could have videos on it people could vote and it's crazy

511
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,500
that's awesome you guys rock I don't know I don't know what to tell you guys

512
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:26,500
Guys, I'd love to see it happen some day, but at the same time, gotta pay the rent, so I can't quit my J-Dog yet until somebody says,

513
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:32,500
Here, Rob, here's some money. Come to a show. Then I'd be all, Fuck yeah, I quit. We'll see. And I'm sure you're the same, right?

514
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:38,500
What was the line from Wayne's World? Get paid to do Wayne's World?

515
00:44:38,500 --> 00:44:46,180
Yeah. That's like my dream right there is Wayne's World the movie, except don't they

516
00:44:46,180 --> 00:44:53,180
get kind of screwed in the end? Oh well. Who cares? We'll see, maybe someday. But I think

517
00:44:53,180 --> 00:44:57,420
the podcast is a really exciting technology because it allows people like Adam Curry to

518
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:07,820
hear us. Anyway, we'll see what happens. Alright, anyway, so there's the podcast. Again, I urge

519
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:11,240
you guys to check this out on the website over at orangehonoredradio.com. Just look

520
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:15,400
in the upper left, it says Orange Honored Radio to go. It's really easy to set up.

521
00:45:15,400 --> 00:45:18,780
Honestly, if you were able to listen to this show, if you were able to sign up for Live

522
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,380
365 and get this show to play, you can do this podcast thing. It's super easy. And again,

523
00:45:24,380 --> 00:45:28,380
you don't have to have a portable player. You can just have it download the MP3 and

524
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,500
you'll listen to it in Winamp or iTunes or whatever later. And just an FYI, for those

525
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:39,100
you guys that do listen to this. That show is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, which doesn't

526
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:42,660
do you any good if you have an iPod, because iPods don't decode it, but if you're using

527
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:47,380
Winamp, you can actually listen to that show in MP3 Pro, and it sounds great. So, just

528
00:45:47,380 --> 00:45:53,380
a thought. All right. Anyway, on to some actual gaming news. Let's talk gaming news that's

529
00:45:53,380 --> 00:46:02,220
going on right now. Huge, no, this is huge. This is really huge. All right. In the DDR

530
00:46:02,220 --> 00:46:08,300
this week, there was huge news. What has been one thing that people in the DDR scene have

531
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:16,740
been begging for for the longest time, other than to get laid? A 62 foot long cigar? No,

532
00:46:16,740 --> 00:46:26,520
not a 62 foot long cigar. What else? They want more Mamba like Go-Go. They want a DDR

533
00:46:26,520 --> 00:46:31,220
game featuring characters from other games that have nothing to do with DDR whatsoever.

534
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:35,300
That's absolutely right. No, actually, I'll tell you, since you obviously don't know.

535
00:46:35,300 --> 00:46:38,860
They want a DDR game on the GameCube.

536
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:44,340
Because GameCube doesn't have a DDR game. There was one on the Nintendo 64. Well, not the GameCube.

537
00:46:44,340 --> 00:46:49,780
So, GameCube, announced this week, is getting its own DDR game.

538
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,180
Does this fulfill my fantasy for having to buy yet another peripheral for

539
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:55,020
another game system to play DDR?

540
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:58,460
You can never have too many specialty controllers, dammit. It absolutely does.

541
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:09,460
And if you think about it, Nintendo is really the granddaddy of DDR, the granddaddy, granddaddy, granddaddy, like the great, great granddaddy of DDR is Dance Aerobics, if you think about it, with the power pad.

542
00:47:09,460 --> 00:47:15,960
So, um, it makes sense that, uh, it's going back to its roots, and DDR is going to be showing up on the GameCube.

543
00:47:15,960 --> 00:47:22,960
Details are very sketchy at this time, this is what we know. It's DDR featuring Mario.

544
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:28,960
We can, uh, urge to refer to old cartoon rising.

545
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,960
I know, I know, seriously.

546
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,960
Absolutely the first thing I thought of when I heard this, I read this story and it was very...

547
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:41,960
Earlier this week the rain was keeping me up at like 4 in the morning, and I ended up getting online and I read about this.

548
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:51,960
And just instantly, I couldn't help but when I read that DDR and Mario were teaming up to do this, I couldn't help but think about this.

549
00:47:51,960 --> 00:47:56,960
Hey, Paisanos! It's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show!

550
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:23,960
Thank you, late 80s, early 90s.

551
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:29,960
Koopas and Koopas, the princess and the others, hanging with the plumbers, you'll be hooked on the brothers and the friends!

552
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:49,960
I said hook, hook, hook, hook, hook!

553
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:51,960
Don't the brothers, the brothers, the brothers!

554
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:53,960
Oh, you gotta love that echo at the end.

555
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:56,960
Hooked on the brothers, brothers, brothers.

556
00:48:56,960 --> 00:49:00,960
I am petitioning Nintendo myself to have that song included.

557
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:04,960
It needs to be there. It absolutely needs to be there in DDR Mario.

558
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:06,960
Or the one with Lou Albano singing it at the end.

559
00:49:06,960 --> 00:49:10,960
Let's all do some Mario. Remember that one?

560
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:13,960
I wish we had an MP3 that we could play too, but...

561
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:18,960
So, here it is. Nintendo is going to be doing this DDR game, but Konami...

562
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:25,960
It's some kind of partnership, and we don't really know in what capacity if Nintendo is making the game with Konami's blessing, or what's going on.

563
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:35,960
I have a feeling it's going to be very similar to Donkey Konga, because when you look at Donkey Konga, it's basically Taiko Drum Master, but with Donkey Konga.

564
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,960
Stupid clapping!

565
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:45,960
But it had Namco's blessing. Namco actually helped them out with the game, so I think it's going to be very similar to that. That's just speculation, we'll see. Loki?

566
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,960
There's one thing for sure, it's gonna have awesome minigames.

567
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,960
Because if there's one thing that Nintendo's good at, it's making minigames for games.

568
00:49:52,960 --> 00:50:01,960
So, that would be a lot better than that crappy, what, feed the oddly shaped animal heads or whatever, you know?

569
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:06,960
Or the, or the frustrating hit the ball around the maze thing.

570
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:09,960
That's a lot better than that. So, um...

571
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:18,040
I just can't, no, I can't buy this game.

572
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:20,860
It's alright, because I'm definitely going to buy it, I have to buy this game.

573
00:50:20,860 --> 00:50:25,840
If you actually look at our website, orangeontrader.com, we actually posted a story about this earlier

574
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:30,240
this week, it's like the second story down, it says, DDR teaming up with Mario, and if

575
00:50:30,240 --> 00:50:34,520
you actually click on the read more, you can see some screenshots from the game.

576
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:39,640
And the first two screenshots look like your standard DDR setup, although the two player

577
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:43,800
mode is interesting. It looks like some of the dancing characters you can have, you have

578
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,660
a little Mario and then it looks like a little, either that's a hammer brother or it's a Koopa

579
00:50:47,660 --> 00:50:51,100
Troopa. I can't really tell because it's from the Skyview. I think it's a hammer brother

580
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:54,340
because I see a hammer in the picture. So it looks like those are some of the maybe

581
00:50:54,340 --> 00:50:59,480
dancing characters that might be available, who knows? But then the third picture in there,

582
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:04,960
it shows Mario running from snowballs and there are no arrows on the screen. So it makes

583
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,440
you think that it's some kind of mini-game. So I think it's definite that there's got

584
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:14,120
to be a minigame that's going to turn up in here somewhere. All it really is, is it comes

585
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:19,440
down to, look, Konami made a DDR pad. Okay, now we don't have to make another power pad,

586
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,480
so let's make another power pad game. That's what it is. I just, Nintendo I think is finally

587
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,780
realizing they missed the boat on DDR, they should have had this a long time ago. And

588
00:51:29,780 --> 00:51:36,380
that Mad Catz game, what the hell was that MC Groove thing? Okay, that is a bastardization

589
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:41,300
of a dance game. Don't even waste your time. That doesn't count. We're not going to acknowledge

590
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:46,560
that game any further on this show. Period. You know which game I'm talking about. I'm

591
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:51,680
not going to say the name on air. It's by that company that puts out the mediocre dance

592
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:56,340
pads and put out this really, really below average game on the GameCube that Islander

593
00:51:56,340 --> 00:52:02,520
talked about last week. Yeah, exactly. Or you can play Parents Just Don't Understand

594
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,240
for like 5 minutes, because they don't cut their songs down, and then the arrows don't

595
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,240
make any sense at all. And they come from the middle of the screen. What the hell?

596
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:14,920
Oh, you can play In the Groove. I would, I would play In the Groove for 3 days straight

597
00:52:14,920 --> 00:52:19,640
before I would ever touch that other game. Yes, Angel? You look like you have a comment.

598
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,080
I feel a little scared, because you were just talking about the whole Mario thing, and what

599
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:29,240
shirt am I wearing? Oops! There you go, you're in the mood, you're being festive. Alright.

600
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,240
I'm wearing my DDR freak shirt.

601
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:32,240
Yay!

602
00:52:32,240 --> 00:52:33,240
Wow.

603
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:36,520
Oh, now if you two merged your shirts, you'd have this new game.

604
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:40,120
Very true, in a weird sort of way, yeah.

605
00:52:40,120 --> 00:52:41,120
Scary.

606
00:52:41,120 --> 00:52:46,680
The working title of this game is Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

607
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:52,360
Konami and Nintendo are co-publishing the title, whatever that means.

608
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:56,320
Supposedly it's going to have a two player mode and there will be a dance mat that comes

609
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,320
with the game so we won't have to worry about.

610
00:52:58,320 --> 00:53:02,560
But you know that Red Octane's gonna put out a Red Octane 3.0 dance pad that'll have

611
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:06,360
Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation outputs. You know that'll happen.

612
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,720
Uh, minigames. It looks like it's gonna come out summer of 2005 is when this game is

613
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,600
scheduled to come out.

614
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:18,480
Uh, we're gonna get the first peek at the game at the 2005 World Hobby Fair, and that

615
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:19,400
happens on Tokyo-

616
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,800
in Tokyo on January 16th.

617
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:27,960
So, by this time next week, we oughta know some more details on this game, so

618
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:35,720
we'll definitely pass it along to you as soon as we know all right any any wishes

619
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:39,920
you guys hope to see with this game the dance dance revolution with Mario game

620
00:53:39,920 --> 00:53:48,520
anything on your wish list I want the the swimming music to be in there but do

621
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:53,720
do do do do do do do don't make me break out my cell phone I don't know how they

622
00:53:53,720 --> 00:54:00,080
would um no no you don't have to be in there speaking of cell phones all right

623
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:03,480
meantime while she's digging for that angel wish list for this dead sets

624
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:08,880
revolution I was gonna say a remix of the water music myself but if we can't

625
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:16,280
have that and I guess the with a level two music the blue level after the first

626
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:17,280
The blue level.

627
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,280
No.

628
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Here we go.

629
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:23,280
Yes!

630
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Super Mario World!

631
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:26,280
Yay!

632
00:54:26,280 --> 00:54:29,280
Can you really dance to that?

633
00:54:29,280 --> 00:54:30,280
Yes.

634
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,280
And it really messed up straight away.

635
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:32,280
Sure.

636
00:54:32,280 --> 00:54:33,280
It's kinda hard.

637
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,280
I want the campfire medley from Donkey Konga.

638
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:44,280
I love my phone.

639
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:48,280
It's a medley of all these campfire zones. That's pretty good quality.

640
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:52,280
Loki, your wishlist for Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

641
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:58,280
That that be the only game they release on the GameCube for DDR.

642
00:54:58,280 --> 00:55:03,280
Why you gotta hate? Why you being such a hater with this? I've gotta know.

643
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,280
It's gonna suck just like Donkey Konga.

644
00:55:06,280 --> 00:55:10,280
I didn't think Donkey Konga sucked. There could have been more to-

645
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,280
Okay, we get the idea, Jimmy. Seriously, we get it.

646
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:20,280
I was wondering when you'd say something.

647
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:25,280
Donkey Kong, there could have been more to it, but, you know, it wasn't a bad game.

648
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,280
Yeah, it was. Whatever.

649
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:30,280
Alright.

650
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:37,280
My wish list, I want to see Princess Peach as a dancing character, and whenever the stage is over, she'll go,

651
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,280
Peach is the winner!

652
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:53,280
Dude, they should have Princess Peach in the Emi costume that was shown at the Ultramix 2 demo at E3 when Emi was all hoochified. They need that, but Princess Peach would be awesome.

653
00:55:53,280 --> 00:56:15,280
Sigh. I can't wait to find out more information about this game. I actually think this game has the potential to be very cool because Nintendo, they've just got such classic songs and it's going to be so cute. It's probably going to be geared for kids and it'll probably end up being like Oh Ha DDR, but I don't care. Or Disney's Rave, Disney's Mix, whatever you call it.

654
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,760
By the way, we need more kiddie DDR.

655
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,760
We need to get them hooked young, like crack.

656
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,400
It starts with the cigarettes and they move on to crack before you know it they're all

657
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,800
on LSD and then it's like they have a DDR.

658
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:38,760
We get them hooked young, they move up to 2DX and then Dance Me Next and then before

659
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:43,240
you know it they're shaking their asses to deluxe on Pada Pada.

660
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:47,040
It's reminded me of that one, what was that one game that you guys kept talking about

661
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,920
like a long time ago?

662
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:52,600
Jungle Book or something?

663
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,520
Oh god, the game that got me a dance pad for the first time.

664
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
You had that tiny thing.

665
00:56:57,520 --> 00:56:58,520
I did.

666
00:56:58,520 --> 00:56:59,520
It was, okay.

667
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:01,240
And I had to bring you Third Mix to fix that.

668
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:05,920
This was, it was the very first US release of a dancing game.

669
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:08,720
This was out before Dance Dance Revolution USA.

670
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:10,600
And it was the Jungle Book Dance Game.

671
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:14,840
It was put out by, I don't remember what the game, it was Jungle Groove, yeah I think it

672
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,360
was called Jungle Groove.

673
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:20,320
And it actually came with a little dance mat, but the dance mat was made for like a five

674
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
year old.

675
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,980
But I bought it because I wanted a dance mat.

676
00:57:24,980 --> 00:57:29,400
And it was this, I remember that Lou Bega was in it, because like he did a cover of

677
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:32,760
that song that went, I wanna walk like you, talk like you too.

678
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:34,760
Remember that song from the Jungle Book?

679
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,320
And that was like the big song you could unlock if you played it enough.

680
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,800
Loki, you're still giving EDS Evil's death stare over here.

681
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:48,180
Like I said before, this is why they do not need to make any more games for the GameCube

682
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:53,240
that feature DDR. Or, I know this was like for the Nintendo 64. It still sucked. It's

683
00:57:53,240 --> 00:57:57,320
still a Nintendo game. It sucked. This game actually was a PlayStation. This was a PlayStation

684
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:03,280
game that I bought. It still sucked. And I remember that this was right when I was starting

685
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:07,760
to get into DDR, and I finally remember that Jamie and some other folks all came to my

686
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,740
apartment and Jamie actually brought a little plug a mod plug that would plug

687
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:16,520
into the back of the PlayStation the game killer the game killer and then she

688
00:58:16,520 --> 00:58:23,320
bought a brought a copy of third mix and we played DDR third mix on my little

689
00:58:23,320 --> 00:58:27,760
jungle book dance mat that's made for five-year-olds and I don't remember I

690
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:33,520
think it was lanky style was dancing a graduizic cyber funny stuff on that

691
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:41,220
little five-year-old dance pad memories finally the damn thing broke time ago

692
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:46,720
the down arrow broke on that thing after like a week this was what four years ago

693
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:53,640
a long time ago no it was winter when did I get into DDR winter of 2000 so I

694
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:57,680
think it was probably that January because I met everybody in September ish

695
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:03,440
yeah after no it was a little later because a guana girl night and get into

696
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:11,440
We first played DDR at the Rocky Ore Convention, it was October of 2000, and we found the Golf Land machine December of 2000.

697
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,440
That's when we really started to do it.

698
00:59:12,440 --> 00:59:13,440
So it was early 2001 then?

699
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:14,440
It was early 2001.

700
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:15,440
When it was in the winter time.

701
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:22,440
I didn't even know we had machines in town until September of 2000.

702
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:26,440
When I would go play the 1.5.

703
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,440
Oh yes, and play Boom Boom Dollar over and over again.

704
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:33,440
You remember what the trick code was? I don't even remember what it was.

705
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:36,440
It was like left, left, down, down, right, right, or something. I don't remember.

706
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:38,440
No, it was the running steps.

707
00:59:38,440 --> 00:59:39,440
Was it left, down, right, down, left?

708
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:41,440
Left, down, right, down, left.

709
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:44,440
I thought there was... you had to hit one of them twice.

710
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,440
No, it was... that was for Maniac.

711
00:59:47,440 --> 00:59:53,440
Back in my day, you didn't get to just push the little button and be on Maniac steps.

712
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:54,440
You had to do the little...

713
00:59:54,440 --> 00:59:59,440
We didn't have Vivid! We had... they were all one color and we liked it!

714
00:59:59,440 --> 01:00:03,980
And it wasn't called Heavy, it was called Maniac, because you had to be one to play

715
01:00:03,980 --> 01:00:04,980
on it.

716
01:00:04,980 --> 01:00:08,620
And we had one paranoia mix!

717
01:00:08,620 --> 01:00:09,620
Absolutely.

718
01:00:09,620 --> 01:00:11,500
This was so bad.

719
01:00:11,500 --> 01:00:13,840
Preach on.

720
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:18,180
Now I'm all in the mood for some nostalgic DDR music.

721
01:00:18,180 --> 01:00:19,180
So I think we're going to take a break.

722
01:00:19,180 --> 01:00:24,020
And when we come back from this break, more stuff, including tonight's cage match.

723
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:28,180
We're going to do a list list tonight at some point, and who knows what else.

724
01:00:28,180 --> 01:00:35,180
So we'll be back after this, enjoy!

725
01:00:58,180 --> 01:01:04,180
Tell me, why-y-y-y-y, you keep the pockets full of grim, grim dollars

726
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:07,180
I love you like the time

727
01:01:08,180 --> 01:01:11,180
You're very hard, you speak like a young fella

728
01:01:11,180 --> 01:01:15,180
Take me overnight

729
01:01:15,180 --> 01:01:18,180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, something like a bubble

730
01:01:18,180 --> 01:01:22,180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, back to your world

731
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:25,180
Boom, boom, boom, boom, pushing all the buttons

732
01:02:25,180 --> 01:02:27,180
Oh

733
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:28,780
P.M.P. is a tab, tune chaos, don't ask if you can

734
01:03:28,780 --> 01:03:30,780
I'm so hypnotized, P.M.P. is a tab, tune

735
01:03:30,780 --> 01:03:32,780
P.M.P. is a tab, tune

736
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,780
You think what I said, if you didn't bring something

737
01:03:34,780 --> 01:03:36,780
You don't sleep when I eat, you see stuff that might blossom

738
01:03:36,780 --> 01:03:38,380
It don't take time for me to blow your mind

739
01:03:38,380 --> 01:03:40,380
It take a second to reckon because you dumb and blossom

740
01:03:40,380 --> 01:03:42,780
Just rap, but you a empty climber of the circus

741
01:03:42,780 --> 01:03:45,980
P.M.P. is a tab, tune chaos, don't ask if you can

742
01:03:45,980 --> 01:03:47,980
I'm so hypnotized, I know the pause and the loosen

743
01:03:47,980 --> 01:03:49,980
Like a magician, he draws a rabbit out of the hat, son

744
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,780
I'm doing more like a 44th magnet, MC3, stop and don't listen

745
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,780
They try to imagine, just traveling the speed of light

746
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:38,020
Come on, make up, here we go Jumpin' and jumpin' and jumpin'

747
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:40,380
Everybody just jump over and down Feelin' like it's down

748
01:06:10,380 --> 01:06:21,380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

749
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:29,380
You know the thing I realized about that promo? What is Real Radio anymore these days, honestly?

750
01:06:29,380 --> 01:06:33,380
Everyone's on the serious network. Maybe we should go on the serious network.

751
01:06:33,380 --> 01:06:37,380
Seriously? I made it funny, I made it funny.

752
01:06:37,380 --> 01:06:38,380
Oh! Woof woof!

753
01:06:38,380 --> 01:06:39,380
Ugh...

754
01:06:40,380 --> 01:06:41,380
Between...

755
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:42,380
Serious, he's a dog star.

756
01:06:42,380 --> 01:06:44,380
Between...like...you know, typical...

757
01:06:44,380 --> 01:06:45,380
Serious black.

758
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:48,380
FCC licensed black commercial corporate over the air radio.

759
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:52,380
And now you got satellite radio, internet radio and now podcasting.

760
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:54,380
There's so much radio these days.

761
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:57,380
You just fill your ears with oral pleasure.

762
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:00,380
Anyways...

763
01:07:00,380 --> 01:07:02,380
Man's still trying to bring us down.

764
01:07:02,380 --> 01:07:03,380
I know, I know.

765
01:07:03,380 --> 01:07:06,380
I just...I'm having fun watching the chat room there over at

766
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:13,660
www.orangeonsradio.com, click on chat. They're just talking about the DDR Mario game and

767
01:07:13,660 --> 01:07:17,500
just expectations. Some people are already saying, it's going to suck. Game's going to

768
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:25,100
suck. It's going to be horrible. Worst game ever. We shall see. We shall soon see. Somebody

769
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:30,100
was talking about, then somehow the chat in the chat room went on to playing DDR with

770
01:07:30,100 --> 01:07:35,260
a light gun. Like I guess shooting out other people's arrows or something. I have no idea.

771
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:42,260
That would be kind of fun though if you could like, yee-haw, it would be like country dancing, where you dance and shoot. What the hell? That's funny.

772
01:07:42,260 --> 01:07:43,260
Redneck Revolution.

773
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:45,260
Yeah, Redneck Revolution, I don't know. Yes, Angel?

774
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:48,260
Completely off-topic and has nothing to do with the money at all.

775
01:07:48,260 --> 01:07:50,260
Oh, what isn't on this show?

776
01:07:50,260 --> 01:07:56,260
The nail button in You Don't Know Jack where you just keep hitting the end button.

777
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:57,260
Oh, the screw?

778
01:07:57,260 --> 01:08:00,260
Yes, there's a screw. That's right, that's key. That's right.

779
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:04,260
But, yeah, that's what it reminded me of when you said Light Gun and DDR Mario. There was no one going,

780
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:08,260
No!

781
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:12,260
Oh, boy. Alright. I hope this, you know, we don't know

782
01:08:12,260 --> 01:08:16,260
for sure if DDR Mario is even going to come to America.

783
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:20,260
It's so far, you know, all the writings in Japanese, so, but I would...

784
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:24,260
Loki says no plans, but I say it's gotta happen.

785
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:28,260
They would be idiots not to port this to the US.

786
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:32,380
Not even that. All you need is freeloader. I know, but I don't even...

787
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:37,500
I want to play a US mix. Nintendo would be absolute morons to not bring this

788
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,060
game

789
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:43,620
to the US. Absolute morons.

790
01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:48,260
Yeah. No, actually, no they wouldn't. Keep it far away from the states.

791
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:51,300
Far, far away. Stop hating. Don't hate.

792
01:08:51,300 --> 01:08:56,980
Don't hate. Alright. We're going to get into the cage match here pretty shortly. However,

793
01:08:56,980 --> 01:09:02,980
First, I want to allow the Loki here to give us an update on what's going on in the Sim world.

794
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:34,980
The Gravity Dark Sakura Burn Nation Mix, and Legend of Tack on there.

795
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:48,980
And he's also done some other cool songs, so go check those out on BomaniStyle, and if I'm nice, I might go and link them in the LiveJournal community for Orange Launch Radio, which you can find on LiveJournal.

796
01:09:48,980 --> 01:09:55,980
I'm so glad you took the opportunity to hoard that out. Yes, check out our LiveJournal community. Just go to orangelaunchradio.com.

797
01:09:55,980 --> 01:09:58,980
You're being immortalized in the sim file. That's rad.

798
01:09:58,980 --> 01:10:01,980
And one of them is your song.

799
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:02,980
Yeah, I know.

800
01:10:02,980 --> 01:10:05,980
And your name's on the background and everything. It's pretty cool.

801
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:07,980
God damn, I feel important.

802
01:10:07,980 --> 01:10:11,980
So yeah, that's pretty much all that's happened other than that, you know,

803
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:16,980
DDRUK suffered a, I don't know, server crash.

804
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:21,980
But they say that they're pretty much done with the UltraMix 2 sim files

805
01:10:21,980 --> 01:10:27,340
files, and they should be released in a week or so, I think. That's what I heard. Um, because

806
01:10:27,340 --> 01:10:31,540
they were just finishing up the last bits of, uh, the beginner steps, and that was pretty

807
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:36,460
much all that was left. So those should be coming out soon, and, um, DDR Maniacs is still

808
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:45,700
down, and, yeah, I think that's pretty much it. So nothing really going on. Just a dead.

809
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:52,700
Everyone's still kinda coming off the holiday.

810
01:10:53,180 --> 01:10:55,140
Angel.

811
01:10:55,140 --> 01:10:58,100
Yeah, I can talk. Okay, my bad.

812
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:58,980
Um...

813
01:10:58,980 --> 01:11:02,360
Actually, that new skin thing, the technofeen skin,

814
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:03,940
the third one,

815
01:11:03,940 --> 01:11:04,740
uh...

816
01:11:04,740 --> 01:11:08,060
Mikey and I, uh, Big Red Pimp in the chat room,

817
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:10,320
uh... we decided to

818
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:13,980
try playing that online mode this week. That was pretty weird.

819
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:18,860
He kicked my butt twice. How does that work? I haven't really tried the online mode.

820
01:11:18,860 --> 01:11:22,060
You have to like... Is it laggy? No. Oh really?

821
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:24,580
No. It's pretty good.

822
01:11:24,580 --> 01:11:26,500
You like have to have a...

823
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:30,920
You have to put your own IP in it and then you set up the server that way.

824
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:34,980
And then when people try to connect to it they just put in your IP and then

825
01:11:34,980 --> 01:11:37,480
it just works from there. It's pretty cool.

826
01:11:37,480 --> 01:11:41,140
There is a front end for all this, just so people know. It's out there.

827
01:11:41,140 --> 01:11:43,740
I can't remember the website but there is a front end and

828
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:50,100
actual community base are at it so if you search you'll find it yeah it's in

829
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:55,480
options just go down to network and then yeah it's pretty a self-explanatory from

830
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,720
there all right uh if that's it for the sim news then I think we're gonna have

831
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:08,280
ourselves a cage match how's that sound all right let's have a cage match last

832
01:12:08,280 --> 01:12:22,280
Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, Loki put in the most panned song ever in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage match, getting a zero from every single person in the room, including himself.

833
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:27,280
Will he have his revenge this week? We shall soon see.

834
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:39,280
The chat room pick is now out because it got bumped out last week by Jamie's pick, which is a little song called Joe La Taxi, and who knew that anybody liked anything French?

835
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:41,280
But our chat room apparently dug it.

836
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:43,280
I feel like it's French as sung by a Japanese girl.

837
01:12:43,280 --> 01:12:46,280
Yeah, it's a cute song. I'm kind of glad it won. It was a cute one.

838
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:47,280
I like it.

839
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:53,440
And since the chat room choice is out, that option may come back in a later week, but

840
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:54,440
not tonight.

841
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,920
I'm coming back in with a choice of my own, and we shall see.

842
01:12:57,920 --> 01:13:02,760
And I've decided just now, after seeing what all the songs are in Cage Match tonight, I've

843
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:08,120
decided just now, I took a poll in the room about which song they wanted to see me put

844
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:12,960
in Cage Match tonight, and I've decided to go against that, and do what I feel like doing.

845
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:17,960
Well, I took a poll too to see what song I should put in Cage Match, and you picked this one, so...

846
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:21,960
Ah! I laugh.

847
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,960
Very interesting. All right, let's start off with a clip of last week's under...

848
01:13:24,960 --> 01:13:27,960
Oh yes, a reminder on the way to Cage Match works.

849
01:13:27,960 --> 01:13:31,960
It used to be songs that we think would be good in a DDR or other Bomani game,

850
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,960
but now it's just kind of turned into whatever's cool.

851
01:13:33,960 --> 01:13:37,960
Three songs, each host picks a song, puts it in the Cage Match.

852

855
01:14:03,960 --> 01:14:07,080

856
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:12,000

857
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:13,220

858
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:20,220
Jola Taxi for short. Enjoy.

859
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:50,220
If people keep me, don't I care?

860
01:15:50,220 --> 01:15:57,220
La música ajo, se la rumba

861
01:15:57,220 --> 01:16:02,220
Le je roc o mambo

862
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:39,180
Alright though, song number one, and I'm only going to read this one more time because somebody missed the name. Pay attention.

863
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:47,620
Oria Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut. There you go. Let's move into song number two.

864
01:16:47,620 --> 01:16:55,020
Song number two is Loki's pick tonight. What did you pick, Loki?

865
01:16:55,020 --> 01:17:11,020
Well, everyone in the studio here voted for the Wild Card song, and guess what, you see, last week I put in a song by a group called ProdigyRemix.com, that's the Girls IDIOTECH remix.

866
01:17:11,020 --> 01:17:23,020
Well, you didn't like that too much, so you know what, I said, fuck it, I don't give a shit what you like, so you know what, I put in the original, so fucking, you get Girls again.

867
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:29,340
And if I can find a goddamn another remix of this song I will put it in next week too. So suck it. Here's girls

868
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:39,340
Song number two, Prodigy with Girls. Enjoy.

869

871
01:19:25,340 --> 01:19:27,960
It wouldn't be to be us if I'm making cash money

872
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:30,960
Going to all around the world to tell stories of that

873
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:32,960
All the young love for sure

874
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:35,960
All the fun making cash money

875
01:19:47,460 --> 01:19:49,460
Out of the bag

876
01:19:49,460 --> 01:20:15,580
We need glass, we need glass We need glass, we need glass

877
01:21:45,580 --> 01:22:03,660
Jamie, your thoughts?

878
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:08,500
I guess it didn't make it on the air, so that last ehhhhh part, I'm like, if you'd like

879
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:14,580
to make a phone call, please sing us and try again, or deposit 25 cents.

880
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:18,660
actually like that one a whole lot better but it has some annoying parts so

881
01:22:18,660 --> 01:22:23,880
it gets like a six all right six not a zero six from Jamie I'm actually

882
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:29,860
surprised six from Jamie angel I'm gonna be nice and give it a four it wasn't as

883
01:22:29,860 --> 01:22:35,860
bad as last week so whatever yeah I know shit angel gives everything like a nine

884
01:22:35,860 --> 01:22:42,300
or a ten and she gave that a four that's not nice it's better than zero yeah you

885
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:49,340
you got a point all right loki it gets a girls because i want everyone every time to hear the

886
01:22:49,340 --> 01:22:55,740
word girls to think of this song and it will be foreverly imprinted on your brain you'll never be

887
01:22:55,740 --> 01:23:01,420
able to forget the song no matter how bad it sucks it will just stick with you like the goddamn ketchup

888
01:23:01,420 --> 01:23:10,220
song and milkshake song it's just gonna it's just everybody's gonna hear girls and just think of

889
01:23:10,220 --> 01:23:15,460
of that, so it's going to be brainwashed into your head. Anyways, I give it a hundred, because

890
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:22,380
it's awesome. Because I just, the agony of the chatroom felt as well, worth that one

891
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:27,900
hundred. And it looks like we lost only twenty percent of our listeners this week during

892
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:36,620
that song. Good job. My thoughts, let's see. If you were to take a pile of dog shit, and

893
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,940
you put it in a nice shoebox and you put that shoebox in nice wrapping and then you paint

894
01:23:40,940 --> 01:23:45,100
it with glitter and then you tie it up a nice little bow and then you put a little ribbon

895
01:23:45,100 --> 01:23:49,900
on it and it's a little sparkling and then you put you know you plate it in gold and

896
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:58,000
then you cover it in money you still have dog shit but it wasn't as bad as last week

897
01:23:58,000 --> 01:24:05,960
so I give it a one that's more like a dog fart all right but it doesn't matter what

898
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:10,360
we think it matters what you guys think so we will soon see but it's my turn

899
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:16,100
here it is my song and I asked the chat room what they are I'm sorry I asked the

900
01:24:16,100 --> 01:24:19,900
studio what they wanted to hear if they wanted to hear a former Spice Girl but

901
01:24:19,900 --> 01:24:23,960
and that's the one they chose but I decided you know what I'm gonna go with

902
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:29,460
this one I cannot let Prodigy win so I've got to bring out the big guns and I

903
01:24:29,460 --> 01:24:32,860
truly think this is the better song it's when I've been listening into my car all

904
01:24:32,860 --> 01:24:37,620
week it's a group called flower power is the name of the group and they have a

905
01:24:37,620 --> 01:24:44,620
guest singer on this one it's Danny Minow no yes yes again another Mario

906
01:24:44,620 --> 01:24:49,420
reference please kill me here we go this is Danny Minow I'm sorry it's flower

907
01:24:49,420 --> 01:24:56,420
Power Power featuring Danny Minow with a song called, You Won't Forget About Me. Enjoy.

908
01:25:19,420 --> 01:25:25,420
I'm not nothing that I will remember

909
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:32,420
I'll never feel the same again

910
01:25:32,420 --> 01:25:35,420
I'm not nothing that I will remember

911
01:25:35,420 --> 01:25:38,420
Living the dream

912
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:41,420
I'm breathing light and deep

913
01:25:41,420 --> 01:25:43,420
Let it go

01:25:43,420 --> 01:25:46,420

So if you can't love me, then why would you leave.

918

I'm going to let you all over you.

919
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:18,860
If you can't love me, I promise you this.

920
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:22,320
I'm going to have you near me.

921
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:29,780
When you can't love me, I'll hear the music of wonderland.

922
01:26:29,780 --> 01:26:51,220
I need a mystery, I'm breathing in deep Then I hear you say, as you drift away

923
01:26:51,220 --> 01:26:56,860
And it's good to know, it's good to know, that I'm here

01:28:14,120 --> 01:28:17,120
I'll come after you, yeah

943
01:28:17,120 --> 01:28:19,120
Won't you come with me?

944
01:28:19,120 --> 01:28:21,120
You and me, yeah

945
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:25,120
Let's go every day, yeah

946
01:28:25,120 --> 01:28:29,120
Won't you give it to me? I promise you this

947
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:32,120
If I let you in, you

948
01:28:32,120 --> 01:28:45,640
You got a little bit of my next song in there.

949
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,640
That's for next week.

950
01:28:46,640 --> 01:28:47,640
No, I'm kidding.

951
01:28:47,640 --> 01:28:48,640
All right.

952
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:52,200
That was Danny Minnow with You Won't Forget About Me.

953
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:56,640
Let's see if we won't be able to forget that song or if we'd rather would forget it.

954
01:28:56,640 --> 01:28:57,640
Jamie.

955
01:28:57,640 --> 01:28:58,640
It wasn't bad.

956
01:28:58,640 --> 01:28:59,640
It didn't suck.

957
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:01,640
Angel!

958
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,640
Ow. Um...

959
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,640
It's Danny. Um...

960
01:29:05,640 --> 01:29:07,640
Nine.

961
01:29:07,640 --> 01:29:09,640
Loki!

962
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,640
I forgot about the song.

963
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,640
I'm sorry, Danny Minogue sucks.

964
01:29:13,640 --> 01:29:15,640
It's just a fucking clone of Kylie Minogue.

965
01:29:15,640 --> 01:29:17,640
So, you know what?

966
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,640
I don't like it. I'm sorry, it's a four.

967
01:29:22,640 --> 01:29:24,640
I like that song because it's very disco,

968
01:29:24,640 --> 01:29:26,640
and it has a very catchy hook,

969
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,640
and I don't care if you didn't like it tonight,

970
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:31,940

song number two, or song number three.

981
01:30:41,300 --> 01:30:44,700
Come to think of it, don't vote for song number two, please. Alright.

982
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:48,700
Oh wait, I gotta be impartial. My bad, my bad.

983
01:30:48,700 --> 01:30:52,700
Alright. So.

984
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:56,700
What now? Yes, Loki. And if this doesn't win,

985
01:30:56,700 --> 01:31:00,700
I have more girls to go in for next week.

986
01:31:00,700 --> 01:31:04,700
Jamie, we need to institute some new rule against that.

987
01:31:04,700 --> 01:31:08,700
Jamie, help me come up with a rule so Loki cannot put in another remix of Girls next week.

988
01:31:08,700 --> 01:31:12,700
If he loses. Um, the other veto power.

989
01:31:12,700 --> 01:31:16,700
The veto power? The veto power. Alright, veto power's in.

990
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,700
Yep, yep. And let's take a vote. Who votes that we do the veto power next week?

991
01:31:20,700 --> 01:31:24,700
And who votes we don't do the veto power next week?

992
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:28,700
Two against one, Loki loses. Oh shit! It sucks to be you.

993
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:32,700
Although I actually kind of liked the original.

994
01:31:32,700 --> 01:31:36,700
The original. To Loki's credit, the original wasn't as bad as

995
01:31:36,700 --> 01:31:40,700
the one last week. But it was still pretty bad.

996
01:31:40,700 --> 01:31:44,700
I just, we've got to encourage Loki to expand his horizons.

997
01:31:44,700 --> 01:31:48,700
But then he's just going to go and put echo image in or something.

998
01:31:48,700 --> 01:31:52,700
We'll see. Oh, and look at the chatroom.

999
01:31:52,700 --> 01:31:56,700
They're all raising their hand as well. Too bad they don't get a vote. Alright.

1000
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,700
We'll see what happens. What? They get a vote?

1001
01:32:00,700 --> 01:32:04,700
Yeah, they get their vote right now. They're voting for their favorite song. Either

1002
01:32:04,700 --> 01:32:08,700
Jola Taxi or Girls or Danny. We'll see.

1003
01:32:08,700 --> 01:32:13,180
Moving on, what else is going on in the, uh, gaming world right now?

1004
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:16,020
You talked about that you'd actually played some Bomani this week, Jamie?

1005
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:20,220
Just 2DX. Just 2DX? Oh, I thought you actually had gone out to the arcade or something.

1006
01:32:20,220 --> 01:32:23,900
No. Oh. My bad. I haven't had time.

1007
01:32:23,900 --> 01:32:28,140
You know, I, I want to go out to the arcade, but I'm just, I, I can't, I can't get my...

1008
01:32:28,140 --> 01:32:31,380
motivation. I've actually been tempted to redownload

1009
01:32:31,380 --> 01:32:34,700
the BM98. Why is that? Just because I miss it.

1010
01:32:34,700 --> 01:32:36,820
It's so fun.

1011
01:32:36,820 --> 01:32:41,260
What was so great about it? Just the fact that you could... It was the Metal Gear song, but it had the

1012
01:32:41,260 --> 01:32:45,460
whole first level of Metal Gear.

1013
01:32:45,460 --> 01:32:49,460
Alright.

1014
01:32:49,460 --> 01:32:52,900
I need to go out to the arcade sometime this week and play some DDR. We should have like a DDR

1015
01:32:52,900 --> 01:32:54,940
night or something.

1016
01:32:54,940 --> 01:32:57,380
I know, I know.

1017
01:32:57,380 --> 01:32:58,940
Alright, well

1018
01:32:58,940 --> 01:33:02,260
Gee, I guess we're going to take a break and when we come back from the break we'll

1019
01:33:02,260 --> 01:33:07,420
We'll find out who won Cage Match and we will have ourselves a list list for this evening,

1020
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:08,900
so be thinking about that.

1021
01:33:08,900 --> 01:33:09,900
Rob.

1022
01:33:09,900 --> 01:33:10,900
Yes.

1023
01:33:10,900 --> 01:33:11,900
Rob.

1024
01:33:11,900 --> 01:33:12,900
Yes.

1025
01:33:12,900 --> 01:33:13,900
Rob.

1026
01:33:13,900 --> 01:33:14,900
What?

1027
01:33:14,900 --> 01:33:15,900
Rob.

1028
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:16,900
What?

1029
01:33:16,900 --> 01:33:17,900
Rob.

1030
01:33:17,900 --> 01:33:18,900
Rob.

1031
01:33:18,900 --> 01:33:19,900
Rob.

1032
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:20,900
Rob.

1033
01:33:20,900 --> 01:33:21,900
Rob.

1034
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:22,900
Rob.

1035
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:23,900
Rob.

1036
01:33:23,900 --> 01:33:24,900
Rob.

1037
01:33:24,900 --> 01:33:25,900
Rob.

1038
01:33:25,900 --> 01:33:26,900
Rob.

1039
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:27,900
Rob.

1040
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:28,900
Rob.

1041
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:29,900
Rob.

1042
01:33:29,900 --> 01:33:30,900
Rob.

1043
01:33:30,900 --> 01:33:31,900
Rob.

1044
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:37,660
The tonight's list list topic is, game we most would like to see, I'm sorry, video game

1045
01:33:37,660 --> 01:33:40,900
we would most like to see in 2005.

1046
01:33:40,900 --> 01:33:44,740
Now that doesn't mean it has to actually be a game that has been announced, although it

1047
01:33:44,740 --> 01:33:45,800
could be.

1048
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:50,380
You could make something up, but just video game I most want to see so I can buy it in

1049
01:33:50,380 --> 01:33:51,380
2005.

1050
01:33:51,380 --> 01:33:52,380
That's tonight's topic.

1051
01:33:52,380 --> 01:33:58,140
When we come back from this break of music featuring songs from DDR Solo, because I just

1052
01:33:58,140 --> 01:34:01,340
want an excuse to play Temple of Love.

1053
01:34:01,340 --> 01:34:06,340
So we'll be back after this. Enjoy.

1054
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:08,340
Don't forget, vote on tonight's cage match.

1055
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:57,340
Come to the capital of love in your heart Make some joy and the death is my sorrow

1056
01:34:57,340 --> 01:35:00,340
Sex is all the power helping you through the midnight hour

1057
01:35:00,340 --> 01:35:04,340
And the secret of love and peace, soul and heart, it will release

1058
01:35:04,340 --> 01:35:07,700
So, for your head of prey, it's gonna take your fear away

1059
01:35:07,700 --> 01:35:11,700
Flyin' like a snow adult, out of the temple of love

1060
01:35:12,700 --> 01:35:14,700
Come into the temple of love

1061
01:35:14,700 --> 01:35:19,700
And together we'll pray to the heavens above

1062
01:35:19,700 --> 01:35:21,700
Come into the temple of love

1063
01:38:21,700 --> 01:38:27,200
Dream a dream, no but not just a dream If you wanna go for free, boy you're makin' me scream

1064
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:30,200
Ooh la la la la la la

1065
01:38:30,200 --> 01:38:33,200
Take me any way you please, boy you're makin' me scream

1066
01:38:33,200 --> 01:38:37,200
Ooh la la la la la

1067
01:38:37,200 --> 01:38:41,200
You gotta dream a little dream

1068
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:56,200
This it take us different ways

1069
01:39:04,200 --> 01:39:06,200
Don't give a fuck to me

1070
01:39:06,200 --> 01:39:08,200
Don't try to stop me

1071
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,200
Don't wait up and go

1072
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,200
Yo, don't block me, don't be, just block me

1073
01:39:14,200 --> 01:39:18,200
Don't try to stop me, don't wait up and go

1074
01:39:18,200 --> 01:39:20,200
Don't block me

1075
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:21,200
Crop it like a nut, crack a crush is a nut

1076
01:39:21,200 --> 01:39:23,200
Sizzle survivor for my rifle when I'm on the cut

1077
01:39:23,200 --> 01:39:25,200
After end your memory, I like to say to you first

1078
01:39:25,200 --> 01:39:27,200
I done you like Gatorade when I'm quitching my dirt

1079
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,200
I'm the back of the ladder and you're the stable

1080
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:31,200
I'll catch you like my DJ cuts a record on the table

1081
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,200
I wanna rock, get off the battleground

1082
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:35,200
You're no map, swear to God, I'll talk and beat you down

1083
01:39:35,200 --> 01:39:37,200
Crack a sword, I'll put you in a muzzle

1084
01:39:37,200 --> 01:39:39,200
I'll break you in pieces like a jigsaw puzzle

1085
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:40,800
I'll ring your rimes, and I'll murder your style.

1086
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:42,800
I'm the one doing the saying, yeah you're on trial.

1087
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:43,440
I'm conducting.

1088
01:39:43,440 --> 01:39:44,780
I'm rainin when it all in place.

1089
01:39:44,780 --> 01:39:46,640
Form a line such as this so you can bleed your key.

1090
01:39:46,640 --> 01:39:47,840
I want to rock, rock!

1091
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:49,180
Rock.

1092
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:49,680
Get it.

1093
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:50,180
Rock.

1094
01:39:50,180 --> 01:39:50,680
Run.

1095
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,160
Don't beat.

1096
01:39:51,160 --> 01:39:52,640
Just rock me.

1097
01:39:52,640 --> 01:39:54,120
Don't try to stop me.

1098
01:39:54,120 --> 01:39:55,580
Don't wait up.

1099
01:39:55,580 --> 01:39:59,060
And yo, don't clock me to beat.

1100
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,060
Just rock me.

1101
01:40:00,060 --> 01:40:02,040
Don't try to stop me.

1102
01:40:02,040 --> 01:40:04,180
Yo.

1103
01:40:04,180 --> 01:40:08,520
Don't try to climb in.

1104
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:12,520
gaming radio, so uncensored

1105
01:40:12,520 --> 01:40:16,520
that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1106
01:40:16,520 --> 01:40:20,520
Orange Lounge Radio.

1107
01:40:20,520 --> 01:40:24,520
We're back

1108
01:40:24,520 --> 01:40:28,520
here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1109
01:40:28,520 --> 01:40:32,520
Tom Brokaw, our buddy. We miss him already, don't we? That other guy is not quite as cool.

1110
01:40:32,520 --> 01:40:36,520
Alright, you guys ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1111
01:40:36,520 --> 01:40:41,880
Alright. I'll tell you what guys, it was a landslide vote.

1112
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:48,120
Every song got a couple of votes, but tonight's winner was an absolute landslide.

1113
01:40:48,120 --> 01:40:51,480
Getting twice as many votes as the other two songs combined.

1114
01:40:51,480 --> 01:40:55,440
What do you think? What do you think? All that being said, who do you think won it?

1115
01:40:55,440 --> 01:40:59,080
Loki says my song. What do you think, Jamie?

1116
01:40:59,080 --> 01:41:03,480
I think I don't care. I think you don't care. What do you think, Loki?

1117
01:41:03,480 --> 01:41:08,600
Yeah, just kidding angel, what do you think I already know so I can't say I

1118
01:41:10,160 --> 01:41:12,160
Guess I'll say

1119
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:18,880
Guys these that are toss-up between jammies or yours. All right. Well, let's see. It's nice cage match winner is

1120
01:41:20,560 --> 01:41:22,560
Don't look taxi

1121
01:41:23,400 --> 01:41:25,160
I

1122
01:41:25,160 --> 01:41:29,840
Actually kind of thought that it would be yours blew the other two songs out of the freaking water

1123
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:33,360
I got two more where that came from, baby.

1124
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,840
Well, thank you, chatroom. You really love me.

1125
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:41,520
Alright. Actually, I'm not so sure if it's that they love you as they hated the other two songs.

1126
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:43,520
Well, I know. Your song was kind of cool. I liked it.

1127
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,760
Alright. Alright, so, Joel attacks. He wins it two weeks in a row.

1128
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:52,960
Alright. Loki's going to keep trying, though. He wants to put girls up again next week,

1129
01:41:52,960 --> 01:41:56,240
so we'll see what happens. I'm going to tell you, you're going to keep losing, too.

1130
01:41:56,240 --> 01:42:01,040
next yet another week I don't have to pick a song thank you everybody then

1131
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:05,480
next week we haven't had a two-week winner since well Gwen Stefani wasn't

1132
01:42:05,480 --> 01:42:10,440
that long ago I suppose how was the last song we had to retire all right all

1133
01:42:10,440 --> 01:42:15,920
right all right let's get into tonight's list list now let's explain the way

1134
01:42:15,920 --> 01:42:19,520
list list works because I know a lot of you guys are new to orange lounge radio

1135
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:24,040
whether it be through the DER freak repeats which are on Friday nights at

1136
01:42:24,040 --> 01:42:27,360
6 o'clock if you ever miss this show by the way on DDR Freak Radio or through

1137
01:42:27,360 --> 01:42:31,360
the podcast so it's very possible you haven't heard list list before basically

1138
01:42:31,360 --> 01:42:38,920
what we do is we are making a definitive list through our own process each host

1139
01:42:38,920 --> 01:42:44,080
and guest nominates three songs that should be on the list and then we go

1140
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:48,040
around and we each eliminate one song and then you guys in the chat room vote

1141
01:42:48,040 --> 01:42:55,000
and we come up with the definitive list. So tonight's list is going to be video

1142
01:42:55,000 --> 01:42:59,240
game you most want to see in 2005. And this can be something that's already

1143
01:42:59,240 --> 01:43:05,640
been announced. This could be something that you just are have a dream about. It

1144
01:43:05,640 --> 01:43:08,960
could be just about anything. We're really not setting any limits on this. So let's

1145
01:43:08,960 --> 01:43:13,460
see what everybody comes up with. But in order to do listless properly, we have to

1146
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,800
bring in our game show announcer and our game show music. So you guys ready to do

1147

Hi.

1157
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:21,240
And say hello to the inventor of Rice-a-roni, Loki.

1158
01:44:21,240 --> 01:44:23,240
No.

1159
01:44:23,240 --> 01:44:27,240
Also helping us out, say hello to TDR Angel!

1160
01:44:27,240 --> 01:44:29,240

01:44:29,240 --> 01:44:31,240
And say hello to Sky!

1162
01:44:31,240 --> 01:44:33,240
Hi.

1163
01:44:33,240 --> 01:44:35,240
Hey, Mr. Announcer!

1164
01:44:35,240 --> 01:44:37,240
Yes, Dark Sacra!

1165
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:40,240
Did you ever get this shoe removed from your butt?

1166
01:44:40,240 --> 01:44:43,240
I have no idea what you're talking about!

1167
01:44:43,240 --> 01:44:45,240
Ow.

1168
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,240
Alright, let's get this started.

1169
01:44:50,240 --> 01:44:52,560
Who's going to start us off tonight with tonight's list?

1170
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:57,400
We're going to start off with, oh, I better get a program open so I can start transcribing

1171
01:44:57,400 --> 01:44:58,400
the list.

1172
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,640
I'm just, I'm not ready for tonight's segment, what can I say?

1173
01:45:00,640 --> 01:45:01,640
I'm never prepared.

1174
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:04,960
All right, let's see, who wants to start us off?

1175
01:45:04,960 --> 01:45:05,960
Jamie.

1176
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:06,960
Why the hell not?

1177
01:45:06,960 --> 01:45:09,080
You always start off these segments, so why not?

1178
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:10,080
Why the hell not?

1179
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,080
You're number three pick.

1180
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,120
Pimp My Ride the Game.

1181
01:45:15,120 --> 01:45:19,920
After all, you know, and all of those racing games they have where you can customize your

1182
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:23,560
car and everything. They just need a game of nothing but that because that's the most

1183
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:29,320
fun. Pimp my ride the game. Pimp my ride the game. That's pretty creative. I got to give

1184
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:36,240
that to you. That's good. All right. Loki, your number three pick. This one just came

1185
01:45:36,240 --> 01:45:41,800
to me now. It's just like an epiphany. This one is going to have similar game play to...

1186
01:45:41,800 --> 01:45:49,040
Oh, I got to get the giggles out. Calm. Okay. It's going to have similar game play to Katamari

1187
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:56,200
Dimashii. I think it'd be very popular because everybody, you know, has these. They can identify

1188
01:45:56,200 --> 01:46:08,600
with them. It's roll my SUV the game. Cause you know, those SUVs, they like the roll.

1189
01:46:08,600 --> 01:46:13,840
I don't get it or something. Can you explain the joke please for the mentally challenged

1190
01:46:13,840 --> 01:46:18,960
such as myself? Giant fucking vehicles that have no point in being on a roll.

1191
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:26,960
On a road, okay, and people drive them out around like they're race cars, and well, since they have a high center of balance, they tend to roll.

1192
01:46:26,960 --> 01:46:31,960
Like, as in flip over, as in crash, explode, people die.

1193
01:46:31,960 --> 01:46:33,960
Sounds like Burnout 3.

1194
01:46:33,960 --> 01:46:37,960
Sounds like Driver 3. Angel, your number 3 pick, please.

1195
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:47,960
Okay, I was going to say Actraiser DS, just because I was being serious, but I think I need to steal K-Dash's suggestion, which was DDR Demashi.

1196
01:46:47,960 --> 01:46:50,960
Because it sounded funny.

1197
01:46:50,960 --> 01:46:53,960
And how exactly does DDR Demashi work?

1198
01:46:53,960 --> 01:46:59,960
I have no idea, but it sounded funny at the time, so you know what, he gets a cookie for that one.

1199
01:46:59,960 --> 01:47:05,960
Alright, fair enough. My number three pick, I actually went with a serious one, heaven forbid.

1200
01:47:05,960 --> 01:47:11,960
This is a game that has needed to come out for about the past ten years. Kid Icarus 2005.

1201
01:47:11,960 --> 01:47:13,960
Holy shit, yeah.

1202
01:47:13,960 --> 01:47:19,580
I seriously, seriously don't get it.

1203
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:23,980
Nintendo has this character, many people still know this character and love this

1204
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:24,620
character,

1205
01:47:24,620 --> 01:47:28,380
and yet this character is yet to turn up in any type of Super Smash Brothers game

1206
01:47:28,380 --> 01:47:29,100
or anything.

1207
01:47:29,100 --> 01:47:32,660
What the hell? They could do a kick-ass game with Kid Icarus.

1208
01:47:32,660 --> 01:47:37,060
Maybe the next Animal Crossing? I don't know, we'll see.

1209
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:41,680
We will see what happens. Alright, moving on.

1210
01:47:41,680 --> 01:47:48,040
Number two pick time. Jamie, your number two pick please. The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

1211
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:53,600
The Sims, Sims in the Hood. But I'm not meaning like the herbs. Okay, yeah. I mean

1212
01:47:53,600 --> 01:48:00,120
like we have ghetto Sims that have to go, you know, pick up their cheese. I need to

1213
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:05,080
like have like realistic. And I'm gonna spell that Sims with a Z. Oh, I did too.

1214
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:09,080
Okay, good. Alright. Sims into hood.

1215
01:48:09,080 --> 01:48:13,080
Uh, Loki, your number two pick, please.

1216
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:17,080
This one's a request by Nellie. She wants the girl game.

1217
01:48:17,080 --> 01:48:21,080
Much like the guy game, but, you know, no breasts and more

1218
01:48:21,080 --> 01:48:25,080
cock shots. You know, funny you should mention this, because

1219
01:48:25,080 --> 01:48:29,080
something similar is going to come up on my list, but we'll see. Uh, Angel, your number

1220
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:33,080
two pick. You know, I was just looking at the poster over there and I just had to giggle it myself

1221
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:38,360
because I just picked something completely at random except I don't know if I want to

1222
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:44,000
call it one thing or the other. Okay, I was either going to say Kill Bill Online or something

1223
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:45,760
just because I was just being completely random.

1224
01:48:45,760 --> 01:48:47,800
So, Kill Bill the game or Kill Bill Online?

1225
01:48:47,800 --> 01:48:48,800
Oops.

1226
01:48:48,800 --> 01:48:49,800
Uh-oh.

1227
01:48:49,800 --> 01:48:50,800
She took my number one.

1228
01:48:50,800 --> 01:48:51,800
I'm sorry.

1229
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:52,800
Oh, no. All right.

1230
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:58,040
I have to think of something new now. I had Kill Bill the RPG. That would have been cooler.

1231
01:48:58,040 --> 01:48:59,560
See? You still would have gotten props from me.

1232
01:48:59,560 --> 01:49:01,800
So, do you want Kill Bill the RPG, Angel?

1233
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:02,800
Yeah.

1234
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:10,520
and she just stole Jamie's just like that. What a bitch. I hate you. Alright. My number two pick is

1235
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:17,480
another serious one, heaven forbid. I would like to see a true sequel to

1236
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:21,840
Castlevania Symphony of the Night and I'm not talking those 3D bullshit. I want

1237
01:49:21,840 --> 01:49:28,720
a 2D, beautiful, I don't care what they do, I want a 2D Castlevania game that

1238
01:49:28,720 --> 01:49:34,440
just fucking sleeps with me, it's that good. So I'm gonna call it Castlevania Symphony

1239
01:49:34,440 --> 01:49:42,640
of the Night 2. Um, then, actually, and now it's for the DC. Yes. Then that is the game

1240
01:49:42,640 --> 01:49:50,280
I'm most, no, okay, then I'm gonna be specific. On PS2, I'm sick of this handheld bullshit.

1241
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:54,800
I want one on a console. Well, put it on a good system and put it on the Xbox. I don't...

1242
01:49:54,800 --> 01:49:56,400
So it'll actually look good.

1243
01:49:56,400 --> 01:49:58,760
I don't give a shit. I just want it... I don't want it on a

1244
01:49:58,760 --> 01:50:00,560
freakin' handheld. I want it

1245
01:50:00,560 --> 01:50:03,760
on the big TV so I can turn up the speakers

1246
01:50:03,760 --> 01:50:08,680
and blast the shit out of the Castlevania music.

1247
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:09,960
Anyway, moving on.

1248
01:50:09,960 --> 01:50:11,020
Uh...

1249
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:13,120
Jamie, did you manage to find a new number one?

1250
01:50:13,120 --> 01:50:15,720
Yeah, I guess so. Okay, what is your new number one?

1251
01:50:15,720 --> 01:50:18,240
Console Ragnarok Online.

1252
01:50:18,240 --> 01:50:22,920
Fully customizable.

1253
01:50:22,920 --> 01:50:26,840
Ragnarok Online to your console. Beautiful.

1254
01:50:26,840 --> 01:50:28,780
Angel, you're number one.

1255
01:50:28,780 --> 01:50:32,220
You don't have one yet. Oh, sorry. Loki, you're number one.

1256
01:50:32,220 --> 01:50:35,080
Oh, man. Um...

1257
01:50:35,080 --> 01:50:40,160
Let's see. What would be a good game?

1258
01:50:40,160 --> 01:50:41,860
I know, I know, I know.

1259
01:50:41,860 --> 01:50:46,280
Well, let's... No, actually, that's gonna suck. Um...

1260
01:50:46,280 --> 01:50:47,560
You know what?

1261
01:50:47,560 --> 01:50:48,540
Goddammit.

1262
01:50:48,540 --> 01:50:52,560
How about this? This is gonna be my game. It's called Get Off Your Ass and Get a Job,

1263
01:50:52,560 --> 01:50:55,560
of the game

1264
01:50:55,560 --> 01:50:59,560
this will teach those fat fuckers that play games all the time to fucking get off their ass

1265
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:06,560
go outside and get a job and provide for your family

1266
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:10,560
it's not about leveling your fucking character it's about getting a god damn job

1267
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:12,560
that's what it's about

What is Happy Bunny?

1284
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:26,560
My personal avatar.

1285
01:52:26,560 --> 01:52:30,360
Let Jamie do it, cause Jamie's cooler.

1286
01:52:30,360 --> 01:52:31,360

1287
01:52:31,360 --> 01:52:35,880
Um, I believe that my favorite Happy Bunny line is this cute little bunny, you see, that's

1288
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:38,600
looking all happy, all sweet, and everything.

1289
01:52:38,600 --> 01:52:43,800
My favorite one is, school prepares you for the real world, which also sucks.

01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:48,680

1293
01:52:59,320 --> 01:53:03,920
number one pick and it's very similar to one that Loki put in earlier but I had a

1294
01:53:03,920 --> 01:53:08,360
different idea you guys know the guy game right well we need a game that

1295
01:53:08,360 --> 01:53:12,680
caters to the other percentage of the male population the gay guy game and

1296
01:53:12,680 --> 01:53:18,040
and that is my number one pick. Alright.

Now it's time for the elimination round.

1298
01:53:21,960 --> 01:53:26,520

1300
01:53:31,400 --> 01:53:34,880
Not a song. What? Not a song.

1301
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:38,240
No, you're right. It's not a song. It's an item from the list. Here we go.

1302
01:53:38,240 --> 01:53:42,120

01:53:42,120 --> 01:53:45,400

Alright, Jamie, you get the first elimination. What's coming off the list?

1311
01:54:17,560 --> 01:54:21,480
Umm...

1312
01:54:21,480 --> 01:54:26,240

1313
01:54:26,240 --> 01:54:29,960

1314
01:54:29,960 --> 01:54:33,440

Get off your ass and get a fucking job at the game. Really?

1316
01:54:36,320 --> 01:54:39,760
Oh, I would have thought this would have been your anthem.

1317
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:45,600
defeating the purpose. You could play about getting a fucking job, you could go get a

1318
01:54:45,600 --> 01:54:53,920
fucking job. Alright. So, yeah, defeat the purpose. Alright. Loki! Um, I'm gonna have

1319
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:58,600
to take off, uh, Ragnarok Online, the console game, cause that game sucks, and doesn't deserve

1320
01:54:58,600 --> 01:55:03,240
to be on console. It's made by Koreans, there's, you know... Well, the same can be said about

01:55:03,240 --> 01:55:09,240
Final Fantasy XI, which also sucks. Yeah, but that's on a console already. D'oh! Yeah,

But not so late, a thousand years since I was raised

1353

To emulate the storm in the middle of the dark

1354
01:58:24,060 --> 01:58:28,060

Close your eyes, close your eyes and let us fly You and I, together we can touch the sky

1387
02:03:09,500 --> 02:03:13,500

You came like a summer breeze

02:03:16,500 --> 02:03:20,500
Sweeping my breath away

1390
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:23,500

02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:27,500
You and I together in the sky

1392
02:03:27,500 --> 02:03:30,500

1404
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:46,500
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting

1405
02:04:46,500 --> 02:04:51,500
as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1406
02:04:51,500 --> 02:04:57,000
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More program. Can we talk about that?

1407
02:04:57,000 --> 02:04:59,500
No subject will ever be taboo.

1408
02:04:59,500 --> 02:05:03,500
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

1409
02:05:03,500 --> 02:05:06,500
Except, of course, the subject that was just under discussion.

1410
02:05:06,500 --> 02:05:12,500
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1411
02:05:12,500 --> 02:05:14,500
I collect your fucking head.

1412
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:17,500
Just like this fucker here.

1413
02:05:17,500 --> 02:05:26,500
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1414
02:05:26,500 --> 02:05:34,500
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1415
02:05:34,500 --> 02:05:42,500
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

1416
02:05:42,500 --> 02:05:47,380
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and we're about ready to reveal the winners of

1417
02:05:47,380 --> 02:05:52,660
tonight's list list, the definitive list of games we most want to see in 2005. It's very

1418
02:05:52,660 --> 02:05:57,260
funny though because the chat room was just going off on these ideas about Orange Lounge

1419
02:05:57,260 --> 02:06:02,740
Radio the game. Phoenix in the chat room says, Orange Lounge Radio the game, you could be

1420
02:06:02,740 --> 02:06:07,180
one of the broadcasters and then if Loki says something retarded or votes for a bad song,

1421
02:06:07,180 --> 02:06:13,700
You would probably be shot with an RPG or a large rifle, failure to do so will cause

1422
02:06:13,700 --> 02:06:14,700
you to lose.

1423
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:17,300
Hey, I like that idea.

1424
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:19,060
And let's see, what else is it?

1425
02:06:19,060 --> 02:06:23,820
Jaded2005 says, make it an RPG where you guide the Orange Lawns Radio guys to the studio

1426
02:06:23,820 --> 02:06:25,380
before the show starts.

1427
02:06:25,380 --> 02:06:28,220
K-Dash says, make sure they get there before 6.

1428
02:06:28,220 --> 02:06:29,220
Ha!

1429
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:33,660
More like real life, make it before they get here by 6.32 because that's about what time

1430
02:06:33,660 --> 02:06:35,540
they usually get here.

1431
02:06:35,540 --> 02:06:52,540
BlackDevilerX says, OrangeOnsRadio the game definitely belongs on the Playstation 2. Yes, so we can be badly anti-aliased just like all the rest of the games on PS2, that'd be great. We could look very pixelated on the edges, be hot. Can't wait.

1432
02:06:52,540 --> 02:06:55,540
DarkSakura, what do you think of OrangeOnsRadio the game?

1433
02:06:55,540 --> 02:06:56,540
What do you think of wedding kimonos?

1434
02:06:56,540 --> 02:06:58,540
I don't care, get with the show!

1435
02:06:58,540 --> 02:07:05,540
Um, I think that I would have to go around with hammers hitting people in the head with them in the game.

1436
02:07:05,540 --> 02:07:12,540
Love you. Okay, you can go back to the wedding talk now. Girl talk. With the silent Nelly. Angel?

1437
02:07:12,540 --> 02:07:20,540
Does that mean I can kill everybody with halos? Oops, did I say that? And stuff. Yeah, I'm not funny. Okay, bye.

1438
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:27,540
Alright, let's get into tonight's winners from Listless.

1439
02:07:27,540 --> 02:07:41,540

1454
02:09:10,960 --> 02:09:11,960
Hello, El Mullet!

1455
02:09:11,960 --> 02:09:12,960
How are you, my friend?

1456
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,720
I am doing good, Sky.

1457
02:09:14,720 --> 02:09:15,720
How about yourself?

1458
02:09:15,720 --> 02:09:16,720
Good.

1459
02:09:16,720 --> 02:09:17,720
Long time no talk?

1460
02:09:17,720 --> 02:09:18,720
Yeah, long time no listen.

1461
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:21,080
I've just got...

1462
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:23,800
As with most people, it's all right.

1463
02:09:23,800 --> 02:09:26,800
I take my sabbaticals from things every now and then.

1464
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,800
It's okay.

1465
02:09:27,800 --> 02:09:28,800
It's all right.

1466
02:09:28,800 --> 02:09:30,880
Well, what's new in the El Mullet world?

1467
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:36,200
Well, in the El Mullet world, I've recently restarted Encore Extra Stage.

1468
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:39,320
You will be receiving your weekly plug, as always.

1469
02:09:39,320 --> 02:09:42,940
and I've been I've actually

1470
02:09:42,940 --> 02:09:46,740
gone a bit mainstream I can't stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3

1471
02:09:46,740 --> 02:09:51,400
I mean San Andreas for some reason. Because you like the n-word because

1472
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:53,840
that's about the only reason I can see to keep playing that game

1473
02:09:53,840 --> 02:09:58,120
No, I'm kidding. Yes, the n-word is funny. I can't quote half the game.

1474
02:09:58,120 --> 02:10:03,520
Alright. Loki, you were playing San Andreas for a while but you stopped. What happened, Loki?

1475
02:10:03,520 --> 02:10:07,000
Oh, fancy. Exactly.

1476
02:10:07,000 --> 02:10:14,000
In all seriousness, what is it about San Andreas that's drawing you to that game?

1477
02:10:14,000 --> 02:10:16,000
I really don't know what it is.

1478
02:10:16,000 --> 02:10:20,000
I mean, for some reason, I like the Grand Theft Auto formula.

1479
02:10:20,000 --> 02:10:22,000
I like the basic gameplay about it.

1480
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:27,000
And this one actually has a good story that goes along with it.

1481
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:29,000
It's a very compelling one.

1482
02:10:29,000 --> 02:10:34,000
It relies mostly on gang warfare than mob warfare.

1483
02:10:34,000 --> 02:10:38,560
and the story is pretty well done you know what I like about the Grand Theft

1484
02:10:38,560 --> 02:10:41,160
Auto games is the fact that you can kinda just go around

1485
02:10:41,160 --> 02:10:45,400
anywhere and do anything you don't really have to go and follow on the

1486
02:10:45,400 --> 02:10:46,480
story if you want

1487
02:10:46,480 --> 02:10:50,640
I mean sure it'll open up new areas new stuff but hell put in the cheat codes

1488
02:10:50,640 --> 02:10:53,520
you can do whatever the hell you want and you can start blown away people with

1489
02:10:53,520 --> 02:10:55,280
rockets and start running from the police

1490
02:10:55,280 --> 02:10:58,800
that's my favorite part of the game is running away from the police

1491
02:10:58,800 --> 02:11:03,320
me personally so what did you think of the list there that we came up with

1492
02:11:03,320 --> 02:11:08,320
I liked it. I liked the list. Kid Icarus made it on there.

1493
02:11:08,320 --> 02:11:11,320
Any particular game you think should have been on the list that wasn't?

1494
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:16,320
Can't really think of any one specifically.

1495
02:11:16,320 --> 02:11:24,320
Alright. I had Beatmania 2DX USA on there because I do think that they should come out with the 2DX USA.

1496
02:11:24,320 --> 02:11:36,320
Truthfully, it looks as though an American release of a 2DX or something along those lines is a bit more realized than it would be, say, like a year ago,

1497
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:42,320
because all of a sudden we see all these music games coming out in the U.S. with their various controllers.

1498
02:11:42,320 --> 02:11:52,320
We have a Donkey Konga, we have Taiko and Otatsujin, and it seems as though if these things are really taking off,

1499
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:57,600
of Konami more incentive to look into porting some of their other Bimani over here?

1500
02:11:57,600 --> 02:12:01,320
I hope so. I hope it's being incentive for them. I guess we'll find out. I'm hoping that

1501
02:12:01,320 --> 02:12:05,200
we're in for a treat at E3 this year, but I'm not going to hold my breath either. I'm

1502
02:12:05,200 --> 02:12:10,860
expecting to see Karaoke Revolution 4, Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3, which honestly wouldn't

1503
02:12:10,860 --> 02:12:15,380
be a bad lineup, don't get me wrong. I mean, they have to do an Ultramix 3. Have to. No

1504
02:12:15,380 --> 02:12:17,840
choice. As far as I'm concerned.

1505
02:12:17,840 --> 02:12:20,080
Ultramix 2 is the best, do you?

1506
02:12:20,080 --> 02:12:25,100
I highly agree. So you were mentioning your column which is Encore Extra Stage. I will

1507
02:12:25,100 --> 02:12:29,600
give you a chance to plug it since you plug us so kindly in your column. Let the listeners

1508
02:12:29,600 --> 02:12:37,160
know where they can read your column. Go to www.insidepulse.com or to go directly

1509
02:12:37,160 --> 02:12:46,960
to my section, games.insidepulse.com. I have a Friday column, Encore Extra Stage. It's

1510
02:12:46,960 --> 02:12:51,880
It's numbered and everything, and it's a pretty good read.

1511
02:12:51,880 --> 02:12:52,880
Pretty good read indeed.

1512
02:12:52,880 --> 02:12:53,880
It's a mediocre read.

1513
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:54,880
No, I'm kidding.

1514
02:12:54,880 --> 02:12:55,880
It's a very good read.

1515
02:12:55,880 --> 02:12:56,880
It's good.

1516
02:12:56,880 --> 02:12:57,880
Thank you, Sky.

1517
02:12:57,880 --> 02:12:58,880
It does compliment you.

1518
02:12:58,880 --> 02:12:59,880
Any time.

1519
02:12:59,880 --> 02:13:00,880
Any time.

1520
02:13:00,880 --> 02:13:01,880
It's okay.

1521
02:13:01,880 --> 02:13:05,200
I mean, I guess if I'm done looking at porn, it's something I can go look at, you know,

1522
02:13:05,200 --> 02:13:06,200
while I'm kind of coming down.

1523
02:13:06,200 --> 02:13:09,920
That's the majority of my fan base, some stick-a-fingered porn watchers.

1524
02:13:09,920 --> 02:13:12,400
Hey, same thing.

1525
02:13:12,400 --> 02:13:13,400
Hey, you know what?

1526
02:13:13,400 --> 02:13:19,100
people that listen to this show while looking at porn, so, you know?

1527
02:13:19,100 --> 02:13:22,020
I don't know how people could listen to this show while looking at porn, because I think

1528
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:23,340
listening to this show would just be...

1529
02:13:23,340 --> 02:13:34,340
I can just see them, all of a sudden, Moki's face appearing on a girl's body, ugh.

1530
02:13:34,340 --> 02:13:37,260
Alright, what else was I going to say?

1531
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:40,260
Over on Inside Pulse, you guys do a lot of game reviews, right?

1532
02:13:40,260 --> 02:13:42,300
Not just you, but the other folks over there, right?

1533
02:13:42,300 --> 02:13:43,380
Oh yeah.

1534
02:13:43,380 --> 02:13:48,060
And so, did you guys do any sort of top 2004 list?

1535
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,900
We did a 2004 awards segment, actually.

1536
02:13:50,900 --> 02:13:55,420
And what was the best game of 2004?

1537
02:13:55,420 --> 02:14:04,340
Best game of 2004, give me a second, let me look it up, it's been a tiny bit since I started.

1538
02:14:04,340 --> 02:14:07,260
How about you personally, while you're looking?

1539
02:14:07,260 --> 02:14:13,220
Me personally, I guess it would be a tie in between Katamari Damacy and Pokemon FireRed

1540
02:14:13,220 --> 02:14:14,220
LeafGreen.

1541
02:14:14,220 --> 02:14:15,220
Really?

1542
02:14:15,220 --> 02:14:17,060
You liked Pokemon that much, huh?

1543
02:14:17,060 --> 02:14:19,100
I'm a Pokemon fan.

1544
02:14:19,100 --> 02:14:23,880
To be brutally honest with you, I've been a fan since the Red-Blue days.

1545
02:14:23,880 --> 02:14:27,740
It's a very engrossing game.

1546
02:14:27,740 --> 02:14:32,540
I love the fact that it's freeform after you go through all the main quests.

1547
02:14:32,540 --> 02:14:36,980
I thought it was good, but I don't know if I could name it best in 2004, but to each

1548
02:14:36,980 --> 02:14:38,980
To each their own. To each their own.

1549
02:14:38,980 --> 02:14:39,980
Loki.

1550
02:14:39,980 --> 02:14:41,980
I have my nomination for best of 2004.

1551
02:14:41,980 --> 02:14:43,980
Actually, I guess it would be kind of best of 2005.

1552
02:14:43,980 --> 02:14:45,980
But start in 2004.

1553
02:14:45,980 --> 02:14:50,980
It would be Gary's Mod, version 5 for Half-Life 2.

1554
02:14:50,980 --> 02:14:52,980
Why? Why?

1555
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:55,980
Because you can pose people and make funny pictures.

1556
02:14:55,980 --> 02:14:57,980
For instance, they have...

1557
02:14:57,980 --> 02:15:02,980
And you can find this all at www.gary.tv slash Gary's Mod.

1558
02:15:02,980 --> 02:15:04,980
Oh, the one with the baby launcher.

1559
02:15:04,980 --> 02:15:10,980
Yes, exactly. It says you can string up a Combine soldier and fire dead babies at him.

1560
02:15:10,980 --> 02:15:18,980
And there's the dead babies. And there's also one that says position rag dolls so they look like they've had a baby.

1561
02:15:18,980 --> 02:15:24,980
It's just so much fun. This is like, this is what we need.

1562
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:28,980
Only you would vote for the game with the dead baby launcher.

1563
02:15:28,980 --> 02:15:31,980
I'd vote for the game with the dead baby launcher. That's pretty cool.

1564
02:15:31,980 --> 02:15:33,980
Post that link in our chat if you can.

1565
02:15:33,980 --> 02:15:35,980
Alright, alright, alright.

1566
02:15:35,980 --> 02:15:37,980
I'm sorry Mullet, we forgot all about you.

1567
02:15:37,980 --> 02:15:41,980
And that game that you guys were looking at there?

1568
02:15:41,980 --> 02:15:44,980
Best of 2004 according to the Inside Pulse folks.

1569
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:46,980
Inside Pulse it was Katamari Damacy.

1570
02:15:46,980 --> 02:15:48,980
I'm not surprised.

1571
02:15:48,980 --> 02:15:51,980
With GTA SA following up his runner up.

1572
02:15:51,980 --> 02:15:53,980
I'm also not surprised.

1573
02:15:53,980 --> 02:15:56,980
Now wait, I'm kind of surprised that Halo 2 isn't mentioned there somewhere,

1574
02:15:56,980 --> 02:16:00,980
but you're a very anti-Halo kind of guy if I remember right, right?

1575
02:16:00,980 --> 02:16:04,980
Yeah, mostly because of the fucking hype.

1576
02:16:04,980 --> 02:16:06,980
The hype killed the game.

1577
02:16:06,980 --> 02:16:08,980
It was a lot of hype. You know what's funny though?

1578
02:16:08,980 --> 02:16:14,980
You and I think DDR Angel are the only people on my Xbox Live friends list that don't have the game.

1579
02:16:14,980 --> 02:16:17,980
Or at least don't have a character registered.

1580
02:16:17,980 --> 02:16:18,980
Wait, what?

1581
02:16:18,980 --> 02:16:20,980
I don't get a logo that loads for you guys.

1582
02:16:20,980 --> 02:16:22,980
Uh, Halo 2. You don't have it, right Angel?

1583
02:16:22,980 --> 02:16:24,980
I don't have Halo 2 yet.

1584
02:16:24,980 --> 02:16:25,980
Exactly.

1585
02:16:25,980 --> 02:16:27,980
I don't even play it, but I have a character made for...

1586
02:16:27,980 --> 02:16:31,980
I just think it's kind of interesting. What about the hype ruin the game?

1587
02:16:31,980 --> 02:16:36,980
Just the fact that, you know, is the overnight people waiting out in line, or just the...

1588
02:16:36,980 --> 02:16:44,980
Oh, not even that. We're talking about a year ago, it was named best game on the Xbox without anybody playing it.

1589
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:50,980
Yeah. You know, I'll tell you what bugged me about Halo 2 was the fact, I mean, I love Halo 2.

1590
02:16:50,980 --> 02:16:55,980
It's an awesome game. Me personally, I love it. I do agree the hype was a little bit much.

1591
02:16:55,980 --> 02:17:02,980
here's my biggest problem with Halo 2. It was Halo 1 with Xbox Live and a kind of better

1592
02:17:02,980 --> 02:17:09,660
story mode, a more theatric story mode. No way, it had the flying things. But Halo 1

1593
02:17:09,660 --> 02:17:13,700
had the warthog? But the flying things are cool because if you get the flying things

1594
02:17:13,700 --> 02:17:17,540
into areas you're not supposed to have them, then you can run around on top of buildings

1595
02:17:17,540 --> 02:17:22,620
and explore. While it had more, it didn't have that much more. That was my complaint.

1596
02:17:22,620 --> 02:17:27,620
And, and, and, and, and, and. It had the, um, the, uh, Arbiter.

1597
02:17:27,620 --> 02:17:29,620
With his Inviso armor.

1598
02:17:29,620 --> 02:17:32,620
No, I don't want the Halo fans sending me a nasty gram going,

1599
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:36,620
You faggot! Why don't you like the Halo games? What is wrong with you?

1600
02:17:36,620 --> 02:17:42,620
Okay, I bought Halo. I like Halo. Like! Like! I just don't love it.

1601
02:17:42,620 --> 02:17:47,620
The Arbiter's level, though, is really aggravating, because you don't know who you're trying to kill.

1602
02:17:47,620 --> 02:17:51,620
Because they're all freakin' Covenant guys.

1603
02:17:51,620 --> 02:17:53,620
I know. It's confusing.

1604
02:17:54,620 --> 02:17:56,620
And then I get motion sick.

1605
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:01,620
Any other thoughts, Mullet, on gaming? What's going on right now or anything in general?

1606
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:07,620
Well, actually, going on to, like, gaming cults and people emailing you going,

1607
02:18:07,620 --> 02:18:10,620
You're an idiot if you don't like this, that, and the other thing.

1608
02:18:10,620 --> 02:18:14,620
I got my first In The Groove fanboy email.

1609
02:18:14,620 --> 02:18:17,620
Ooh, goodie! I haven't gotten any of those yet.

1610
02:18:17,620 --> 02:18:20,620
Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1611
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:25,820
In The Groove is not that great. Send your emails away, okay? There you go. I said it.

1612
02:18:25,820 --> 02:18:32,220
I personally can't comment on the game because there is no machine within the 500 mile radius of my house.

1613
02:18:32,220 --> 02:18:32,720
Yikes.

1614
02:18:32,720 --> 02:18:41,020
But the guy emails my cookie column, which I wrote five months ago, and takes it completely out of context.

1615
02:18:41,020 --> 02:18:47,820
Oh boy, you think they'd put in Moonlight Shadow because of your suggestion? You are selfish. In The Groove rocks.

1616
02:18:47,820 --> 02:18:52,060
Are you going to respond to it in your next column?

1617
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:56,820
I've already responded it to him and I'm gonna print it like up front and center in the

1618
02:18:56,820 --> 02:18:58,060
next column pretty much.

1619
02:18:58,060 --> 02:19:03,380
Can't wait! Can't wait. Silly fanboys.

1620
02:19:03,380 --> 02:19:06,460
Alright, but if you do want to send fanboy or fangirl mail to

1621
02:19:06,460 --> 02:19:09,820
Orange Lawns Radio, you can send it to either Rob at Orange Lawns Radio,

1622
02:19:09,820 --> 02:19:13,540
Jamie at Orange Lawns Radio, or Loki at Orange Lawns Radio. We all have

1623
02:19:13,540 --> 02:19:16,900
those addresses, so have fun. Alright.

1624
02:19:16,900 --> 02:19:19,900
Anything else you want to share, El Mullet, before I hang up on you?

1625
02:19:19,900 --> 02:19:21,900
I can go ahead and hang up now, no big deal.

1626
02:19:21,900 --> 02:19:23,900
All right. Have a good one, Mullet. Thanks for calling.

1627
02:19:23,900 --> 02:19:24,900
Good.

1628
02:19:24,900 --> 02:19:28,900
I cut him off. I'm so rude. I didn't mean to. I'm sorry.

1629
02:19:28,900 --> 02:19:32,900
All right, we're going to keep the Skype line open if anybody else wants to call in.

1630
02:19:32,900 --> 02:19:35,900
I had, as much as we enjoy El Mullet and talking to him on the show,

1631
02:19:35,900 --> 02:19:38,900
I had to let him go because I wanted to see if anybody else wanted to call.

1632
02:19:38,900 --> 02:19:40,900
I got to give other folks an opportunity here.

1633
02:19:40,900 --> 02:19:44,900
What are you looking at now? You're still on this Gary's Mod thing for Half-Life 2,

1634
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:50,180
Life 2. Which, by the way, is a game I really want to play. I just haven't. I'm just, I

1635
02:19:50,180 --> 02:19:58,140
don't know. Loki. I'm working on acquiring it. I have my means. Anyways, the other thing

1636
02:19:58,140 --> 02:20:04,980
that I should note that was posted, Jason, you know, in our chat room there, he posted

1637
02:20:04,980 --> 02:20:12,340
a link to a port for Duke Nukem 3D for Windows. That's pretty sweet. But this Garry's Mod

1638
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:16,700
things so cool because just people like make the weirdest things out of this like

1639
02:20:16,700 --> 02:20:22,300
they have one with a pole dancer which is great I don't even know why it's just so

1640
02:20:22,300 --> 02:20:26,780
funny or this one it's like look ma no hands is some guy riding the bike then

1641
02:20:26,780 --> 02:20:31,500
all of a sudden it's just like smack into a tree I mean just like funny shit but

1642
02:20:31,500 --> 02:20:34,740
this is the best part about it is you can make like your own webcomics just

1643
02:20:34,740 --> 02:20:40,980
doing little screen captures and putting stuff on there it's genius it's fun you

1644
02:20:40,980 --> 02:20:45,040
You know, it kind of reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D when you could make your own maps and you

1645
02:20:45,040 --> 02:20:48,720
could just have like the strippers out in the middle of the street just doing nothing

1646
02:20:48,720 --> 02:20:54,020
but just sitting there on the poles and you can blow them all away with rocket launches.

1647
02:20:54,020 --> 02:20:57,200
I've made some of the most kick-ass Duke Nukem 3D maps ever.

1648
02:20:57,200 --> 02:21:03,920
I'd spent like months on these maps and then like literally I'd run out of space because

1649
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:09,200
in the build engine, which is the whole engine based around Duke Nukem 3D, you're given like

1650
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:12,920
a limited amount of map that you can basically build in and I would

1651
02:21:12,920 --> 02:21:17,640
literally fill up everything just completely fill it up all right we're

1652
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:19,880
gonna go back to the skyline cuz we actually got a phone call wait Jamie you

1653
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:23,600
have a quick comment for you I'm just actually having a flashback to on

1654
02:21:23,600 --> 02:21:29,120
emulators the Metroid level builder oh a guy built his own version of Metroid

1655
02:21:29,120 --> 02:21:33,840
Metroid and the Zelda one too great so man people got too much free time get

1656
02:21:33,840 --> 02:21:37,240
out and get a job get a real huh all right all right I gotta go to the

1657
02:21:37,240 --> 02:21:42,680
collar cuz he's hanging here hi you're on orange lounge radio hey hey big red

1658
02:21:42,680 --> 02:21:49,840
pimp what's up what's on your mind I'm just thinking about all that first

1659
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,080
person shooter crap you guys are talking over there all right what about the

1660
02:21:53,080 --> 02:21:57,880
first person shooter crap I think they that first person shooter players just

1661
02:21:57,880 --> 02:22:03,120
rank up there with people who post on forums there's scourge of the earth now

1662
02:22:03,120 --> 02:22:06,680
wait a minute you need to tell me there is not a single first-person shooter

1663
02:22:06,680 --> 02:22:13,000
game that you kind of like? I have not played a first person shooter that I have liked since

1664
02:22:13,000 --> 02:22:16,820
GoldenEye. Since GoldenEye. So at least there's one, okay? Yeah. And there's not a single

1665
02:22:16,820 --> 02:22:24,000
web forum out there you like either? No. After reading game facts, forget it. Okay, well

1666
02:22:24,000 --> 02:22:29,680
that I could go with. But, not even OrangeLawnsRadio.com forums? You make me sad. I don't, I'm not

1667
02:22:29,680 --> 02:22:33,600
much of a forum whore. Alright, well what do you do on the internet then? Because as

1668
02:22:33,600 --> 02:22:39,400
As far as I know, the internet is all about forum horror, live journal, and chat rooms

1669
02:22:39,400 --> 02:22:41,440
pretending to be people you're not.

1670
02:22:41,440 --> 02:22:43,720
You're forgetting the porn junkies, too.

1671
02:22:43,720 --> 02:22:44,720
Oh!

1672
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:45,720
Shit!

1673
02:22:45,720 --> 02:22:46,720
How could I forget the porn junkies?

1674
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:47,720
Alright.

1675
02:22:47,720 --> 02:22:52,040
So you, instead of posting on forums, you have amassed a collection of pornography?

1676
02:22:52,040 --> 02:22:53,040
No.

1677
02:22:53,040 --> 02:22:54,040
Oh.

1678
02:22:54,040 --> 02:22:55,040
No.

1679
02:22:55,040 --> 02:22:56,040
C'mon, Mikey, no.

1680
02:22:56,040 --> 02:22:57,040
I don't want...

1681
02:22:57,040 --> 02:22:58,040
What?

1682
02:22:58,040 --> 02:22:59,380
Well, then what is it you do on the internet?

1683
02:22:59,380 --> 02:23:00,380
Make fun of others.

1684
02:23:00,380 --> 02:23:01,380
Oh, okay.

1685
02:23:01,380 --> 02:23:05,380
That's pretty much the same thing as what forum posters do. Very similar.

1686
02:23:05,380 --> 02:23:07,380
Cousins. I don't know.

1687
02:23:07,380 --> 02:23:10,380
I have nothing better to do than rant anyway.

1688
02:23:10,380 --> 02:23:14,380
Alright. Well, ranting is for live journals. You should get one of those, uh...

1689
02:23:14,380 --> 02:23:18,380
I don't know, what? Live journal, or what are the other things? Zangas, or...

1690
02:23:18,380 --> 02:23:20,380
I don't know what the hell else there is. Blogger.

1691
02:23:20,380 --> 02:23:22,380
I rant enough in my live journal.

1692
02:23:22,380 --> 02:23:25,380
Oh, so you do have a live journal. So there you go. There's something for the internet.

1693
02:23:25,380 --> 02:23:27,380
Alright.

1694
02:23:27,380 --> 02:23:33,380
Alright, anything else you want to share with us, Big Red Pimp, before we hang up on you? Anything you want to plug?

1695
02:23:33,380 --> 02:23:42,380
Not really, except for the fact that Loki, the song should not be referenced as girls, because girls do not suck that badly, and I'm going to end it as that.

1696
02:23:42,380 --> 02:23:46,380
Loki is actually not in the room right now, but we'll relay the message to him.

1697
02:23:46,380 --> 02:23:47,380
Okay.

1698
02:23:47,380 --> 02:23:48,380
Alright, have a good one.

1699
02:23:48,380 --> 02:23:49,380
You too.

1700
02:23:49,380 --> 02:23:50,380
Bye.

1701
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:53,380
Actually, I hope you heard it from the other room. That would be hilarious.

1702
02:23:53,380 --> 02:23:59,380
Okay, we'll keep the Skype line open for one more call, maybe, possibly. We'll see.

1703
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:03,380
We'll see what happens there.

1704
02:24:03,380 --> 02:24:06,380
I'm just reading our chat room, some random folks there.

1705
02:24:06,380 --> 02:24:09,380
www.orangeandre.com, click on chat.

1706
02:24:09,380 --> 02:24:15,380
Jaded2005 says, first-person shooters are too much for me. People play that for like 15 hours straight.

1707
02:24:15,380 --> 02:24:17,380
I have seen people that play that stuff for 15 hours straight.

1708
02:24:17,380 --> 02:24:22,820
Me personally, I can play it a little bit. I like playing my friends, maybe in an hour-long

1709
02:24:22,820 --> 02:24:26,220
session on a weekend, but that's about it. I can't stand much more than that.

1710
02:24:26,220 --> 02:24:29,780
Alright, we're getting another call. Let's go back to the Skype line and say, hi, you're

1711
02:24:29,780 --> 02:24:30,780
on Orange Lounge Radio.

1712
02:24:30,780 --> 02:24:31,780
Hey, it's Misty.

1713
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,780
Hi, Misty, how are you?

1714
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:33,780
Hi, Misty. Doing good.

1715
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:34,780
Aw, what's on your mind, Misty?

1716
02:24:34,780 --> 02:24:43,980
I just really wanted to say not all the torrents are porn.

1717
02:24:43,980 --> 02:24:50,280
I know not all the torrents out there are porn, but a good majority.

1718
02:24:50,280 --> 02:24:56,060
What kind of torrents do you like to download then, if it's not porn?

1719
02:24:56,060 --> 02:24:58,420
My main downloads are anime, of course.

1720
02:24:58,420 --> 02:25:01,980
I haven't been much in a torrent mode right now.

1721
02:25:01,980 --> 02:25:05,860
I know it's kind of, ever since Supernova went down it's been kind of hard to stay on

1722
02:25:05,860 --> 02:25:06,860
top of torrents.

1723
02:25:06,860 --> 02:25:11,900
I know that one thing I'm going to end up torrenting is probably the new season of 24,

1724
02:25:11,900 --> 02:25:14,500
which was on tonight and I completely forgot about it, so I'm going to have to download

1725
02:25:14,500 --> 02:25:15,500
the first episode.

1726
02:25:15,500 --> 02:25:20,460
It's not really into 24 yet.

1727
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:21,620
I think it's a good show.

1728
02:25:21,620 --> 02:25:24,260
I kind of missed most of last season, but I think it's a good show.

1729
02:25:24,260 --> 02:25:26,020
What kind of anime do you download?

1730
02:25:26,020 --> 02:25:30,300
What kind of anime is good stuff out there right now on Torrid?

1731
02:25:30,300 --> 02:25:33,820
Last major thing I downloaded is the series called Psychic Academy.

1732
02:25:33,820 --> 02:25:39,620
It doesn't seem likely to get released in the US from what I've seen of the series.

1733
02:25:39,620 --> 02:25:41,620
Yeah, Loki, you coming?

1734
02:25:41,620 --> 02:25:45,620
No, I just wanted to hold the microphone.

1735
02:25:45,620 --> 02:25:48,620
Well, I thought maybe you had a question for Misty or something.

1736
02:25:48,620 --> 02:25:51,620
Anything you want to plug, Misty, while you're here on the air?

1737
02:25:51,620 --> 02:25:54,620
Don't really have anything to plug.

1738
02:25:54,620 --> 02:25:56,620
All right, well, fair enough. We just-

1739
02:25:56,620 --> 02:25:58,620
Download the Parappa anime.

1740
02:25:58,620 --> 02:25:59,620
Is that on?

1741
02:25:59,620 --> 02:26:03,620
I found it on anime-suki.com.

1742
02:26:03,620 --> 02:26:06,620
All right, download the Parappa torrent. You gotta let us know what you think.

1743
02:26:06,620 --> 02:26:07,620
All right, I will.

1744
02:26:07,620 --> 02:26:14,620
Alright. Hey, uhh, video game you're most looking forward to seeing in 2005?

1745
02:26:14,620 --> 02:26:16,620
Anything?

1746
02:26:16,620 --> 02:26:20,620
Uh, nothing I can really think of right now, but I haven't been paying much attention.

1747
02:26:20,620 --> 02:26:24,620
That's alright, it's hard to pay attention to this show sometimes.

1748
02:26:24,620 --> 02:26:28,620
I'm just messing with you. Thanks for calling in, Misty, you have a wonderful week.

1749
02:26:28,620 --> 02:26:30,620
You too. Bye-bye.

1750
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:35,620
I like Misty, she's so sweet. She's always there for the show, she's always there in chat to say

1751
02:26:35,620 --> 02:26:38,420
to say when newbies come in throughout the week going,

1752
02:26:38,420 --> 02:26:40,620
is this Orange Louse Radio's chat room?

1753
02:26:40,620 --> 02:26:43,620
Misty's always there to say something hello or say, if she's around, she'll say,

1754
02:26:43,620 --> 02:26:45,620
No, you dumb shits, this is DDR.

1755
02:26:45,620 --> 02:26:50,620
That's what I'm going to say to the next one, no, you dumb shits, this is DDR Freak.

1756
02:26:50,620 --> 02:26:57,620
Although, ironically enough, this show's going to be played on DDR Freak Radio, so for some, anyway.

1757
02:26:57,620 --> 02:27:00,620
It's the Bimani Sims chat room.

1758
02:27:00,620 --> 02:27:04,620
This is Bimani style chat, actually.

1759
02:27:04,620 --> 02:27:06,620
Pimp my dance pad.

1760
02:27:06,620 --> 02:27:10,620
Yes, this is Pimp My Dance Pad, exactly.

1761
02:27:10,620 --> 02:27:13,620
Oh, boy. All right.

1762
02:27:13,620 --> 02:27:18,620
That's it for the Skype line for now. We might open it up again a little bit later there, but I think three is enough for now.

1763
02:27:18,620 --> 02:27:23,620
We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we've got to get ranty.

1764
02:27:23,620 --> 02:27:26,620
We're upset, and we're going to get ranty.

1765
02:27:26,620 --> 02:27:30,620
In this break, we're going to feature some Superstar.

1766
02:27:30,620 --> 02:27:37,180
I wanted to hear, oh no wait, no. We're not gonna hear Superstar. We're gonna hear Ussama Kabota songs, because I promised Jamie we could hear some.

1767
02:27:37,180 --> 02:27:38,400
Ahh...

1768
02:27:38,400 --> 02:27:40,860
I'm sorry, I almost forgot there for a minute, so um...

1769
02:27:40,860 --> 02:27:43,780
Cause I will like go postal if I don't hear Presto.

1770
02:27:43,780 --> 02:27:47,600
Alright, we're gonna cue that up so Jamie does not go postal.

1771
02:27:47,600 --> 02:27:50,660
She has so many reasons to go postal though, honestly.

1772
02:27:50,660 --> 02:27:55,340
Alright, we'll start it off with Presto, Ussama Kabota music.

1773
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:59,140
We'll be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send in by the way

1774
02:27:59,140 --> 02:28:02,300
right now over private message to Sky if you have something you want to say

1775
02:28:02,300 --> 02:28:04,300
after this.

1776
02:33:32,300 --> 02:33:34,300
La di ba

1777
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:52,660
Oi oi, mi nou, mi bais, oi, oi, mi nou

1778
02:33:52,660 --> 02:33:58,660
Ba da di nou, mi bais, oi, oi, mi nou

1779
02:33:58,660 --> 02:34:14,740
Happy, happy, w-w-w-w-w-w-w Happy, happy, happy, w-w-w-w-wah

1780
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:28,000
Orange Lounge radio, we put your thang down. Flip it and reverse it.

1781
02:34:28,000 --> 02:34:30,500
This server made a bit of a fight in the head, nubba.

1782
02:34:30,500 --> 02:34:32,500
Hey sir, I've been made a bit of a fight and you ain't had none before.

1783
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:04,380
these FUs of the week, even though they often don't have anything to do with video games,

1784
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:06,180
why do we have to do this every single week?

1785
02:35:06,180 --> 02:35:08,180
Grr, arg.

1786
02:35:08,180 --> 02:35:12,380
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1787
02:35:12,380 --> 02:35:16,540
Let's, let's try that again.

1788
02:35:16,540 --> 02:35:18,300
Why is it that we have to do these...

1789
02:35:18,300 --> 02:35:21,460
Rob, you are a bitch.

1790
02:35:21,460 --> 02:35:24,100
Minor technical glitch there.

1791
02:35:24,100 --> 02:35:25,300
You are a bitch.

1792
02:35:25,300 --> 02:35:29,660
I thought we could do Switcheroo Night or something and I'd give Loki the gay song or

1793
02:35:29,660 --> 02:35:34,660
I'm just kidding. All right. No, you don't get girls. Um, I'm sorry. Let's try that from the top.

1794
02:35:34,660 --> 02:35:37,660
Rewind. Start over. Take two.

1795
02:35:37,660 --> 02:35:43,660
Jamie? Jamie? Why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1796
02:35:43,660 --> 02:35:44,660
Fuck you.

1797
02:35:46,660 --> 02:35:49,660
Um, my first FU wants to go to Rob.

1798
02:35:49,660 --> 02:35:51,660
This is too serious for you.

1799
02:35:51,660 --> 02:36:08,420
Um, no, my first F.U. of the night is, uh, just to the torrential downpour we had, um,

1800
02:36:08,420 --> 02:36:09,420
it was pretty vicious.

1801
02:36:09,420 --> 02:36:14,060
Another F.U. goes to the HR guy I was dealing with for basically trying to pull the same

1802
02:36:14,060 --> 02:36:19,780
crap he pulled on one of my other co-workers, um, basically whenever we brought up a legitimate

1803
02:36:19,780 --> 02:36:23,260
concern he was trying to fool the company this and I basically turned it right back

1804
02:36:23,260 --> 02:36:27,460
around on him because if there's one thing I'm good at it's point-and-counter point.

1805
02:36:27,460 --> 02:36:34,100
So finally I got him to say that he was going to turn over our VP to our business partner

1806
02:36:34,100 --> 02:36:35,100
over here.

1807
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:37,860
So I'm going to have some investigation going on.

1808
02:36:37,860 --> 02:36:44,780
Um, F.U. goes to the VP for always wanting to put his goddamn hand on my shoulder whenever

1809
02:36:44,780 --> 02:36:45,780
he talks to me.

1810
02:36:45,780 --> 02:36:50,620
like you know I should have just said you know I would rather you not do that

1811
02:36:50,620 --> 02:36:56,460
but the whole thing is that this is a VP and until I report him to HR I don't

1812
02:36:56,460 --> 02:37:03,620
know what's going to be used as a you know a retaliatory action because I

1813
02:37:03,620 --> 02:37:09,660
think he's petty enough to do it so um yeah big etsy goes to him he keeps

1814
02:37:09,660 --> 02:37:13,900
begging me to stay and then he on top of this he's trying to get me to stay there

1815
02:37:13,900 --> 02:37:19,200
through the end of the month, forcing me to stay by some weird, we have to hold her to

1816
02:37:19,200 --> 02:37:25,440
release her some type of bullshit. And my change date's already set with HR. He can't

1817
02:37:25,440 --> 02:37:31,480
freakin' do it, so I get to rub it in his face Monday. That's gonna be awesome.

1818
02:37:31,480 --> 02:37:37,460
Um, F.U. goes to, uh, you know, I really don't have much else to F.U. about except for maybe

1819
02:37:37,460 --> 02:37:43,560
my lack of time. And also, um, an F.U. goes toward my lack of funds and ability to travel

1820
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:48,400
to places that I want to go and see people I want to see. Other than that, I'm fairly

1821
02:37:48,400 --> 02:37:52,660
happy because I don't have to be there anymore after this week. I don't have to look at that

1822
02:37:52,660 --> 02:37:59,660
man after this week. It's going to be so awesome. Yeah.

1823
02:38:01,380 --> 02:38:03,460
She put the mic down, so I'm thinking she's done.

1824
02:38:03,460 --> 02:38:04,060
Done.

1825
02:38:04,060 --> 02:38:06,060
Loki, it's your turn.

1826
02:38:34,060 --> 02:38:39,080
while you're partying I am going afk for a second and they're gone for half an

1827
02:38:39,080 --> 02:38:44,880
hour now fuck that that's stupid if you have things that you know you have to do

1828
02:38:44,880 --> 02:38:51,840
don't play the game get the set-aside time anyways so fuck you that fuck you

1829
02:38:51,840 --> 02:38:58,120
to online websites that don't really correspond with you when you order

1830
02:38:58,120 --> 02:39:03,440
product with them you just kind of have to wait and wait and wait and hope that

1831
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:13,400
they sent it and then just take your money and yeah pretty much all I have

1832
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:20,280
right now yep that's it I don't have anything else I can think of Anna by the

1833
02:39:20,280 --> 02:39:22,280
by the way, suggesting a warp 2.

1834
02:39:25,280 --> 02:39:28,280
What? Oh, oh yeah, we did do that.

1835
02:39:31,280 --> 02:39:32,280
My turn.

1836
02:39:39,280 --> 02:39:42,280
I would like to give a big fat F you to the rain.

1837
02:39:43,280 --> 02:39:46,280
On Thursday night, the rain was so bad.

1838
02:39:46,280 --> 02:39:50,960
bad like we here on the West Coast we're really big pussies when it comes to the

1839
02:39:50,960 --> 02:39:51,760
rain okay

1840
02:39:51,760 --> 02:39:54,920
if it starts are seriously like

1841
02:39:54,920 --> 02:39:58,640
I've been on the East Coast and I've seen how it rains back there when it rains on

1842
02:39:58,640 --> 02:39:59,840
the East Coast it rains

1843
02:39:59,840 --> 02:40:03,040
when it rains like that here people freak out

1844
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:06,160
okay we have to remember it's not built

1845
02:40:06,160 --> 02:40:10,040
around here to handle rain like that it's really not it rains like that out

1846
02:40:10,040 --> 02:40:11,280
here too long it floods

1847
02:40:11,280 --> 02:40:15,760
and I hate to interject on this but Rob you remember seeing me

1848
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:18,080
one of the first times I was out here for a big rain, right?

1849
02:40:18,080 --> 02:40:22,600
I believe so. Me just going what the fuck at all to everybody else

1850
02:40:22,600 --> 02:40:26,680
because it was nothing. But here's the problem.

1851
02:40:26,680 --> 02:40:30,200
I don't have a problem with heavy rain like that. I have a problem when that

1852
02:40:30,200 --> 02:40:31,120
heavy rain

1853
02:40:31,120 --> 02:40:34,960
starts causing so much drainage to fall from the top of the roof and it's

1854
02:40:34,960 --> 02:40:39,320
falling outside my window on the bush that it's keeping me awake and I can't

1855
02:40:39,320 --> 02:40:40,360
freaking sleep.

1856
02:40:40,360 --> 02:40:44,680
So I have to get up at 4.30 in the morning. No, 4 in the morning because I

1857
02:40:44,680 --> 02:40:45,480
can't sleep

1858
02:40:45,480 --> 02:40:50,480
And I get on the computer and read about freaking DDR and Mario.

1859
02:40:50,480 --> 02:40:53,480
I just, I don't know.

1860
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:56,480
I was sad.

1861
02:40:56,480 --> 02:40:59,480
That's it, so I give an FU to the rain.

1862
02:40:59,480 --> 02:41:03,480
Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be pissed off about.

1863
02:41:03,480 --> 02:41:08,480
FU to people that, um, FU to slow service at restaurants. Oh my god.

1864
02:41:08,480 --> 02:41:11,480
That was the slowest service the other day. It made me scream.

1865
02:41:11,480 --> 02:41:13,480
I think that's it. I'm good otherwise.

1866
02:41:13,480 --> 02:41:15,100
here from the original

1867
02:41:15,100 --> 02:41:18,340

1868
02:41:18,340 --> 02:41:19,420

go sub job. Oh well, I'm almost done and I can go back to Black Mage, so yay. Okay, I'm done. See, I'm boring.

1882
02:41:50,020 --> 02:41:55,020
Alright. I actually thought of one. Oh my god, Loki reminded me of one. I gotta go back.

1883
02:41:55,020 --> 02:41:57,020
Okay, go back.

1884
02:41:57,020 --> 02:41:59,020
Rewind.

1885
02:41:59,020 --> 02:42:06,020
That's the theme of tonight, is rewind. Okay, here it is. We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

1886
02:42:06,020 --> 02:42:10,020
Jamie? We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

1887
02:42:10,020 --> 02:42:22,020
You know how in Final Fantasy XI you have Japanese and English players playing together? That's kind of the draw, you know, it's kind of cool.

1888
02:42:22,020 --> 02:42:24,020
Sometimes you get to party. Yeah, I know, that's what I said.

1889
02:42:24,020 --> 02:42:28,020
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Kevin Spacey is supposed to play Lex Luthor.

1890
02:42:28,020 --> 02:42:33,020
Yes, he is. Anyway, my, hello, my segment, my time, my time.

1891
02:42:33,020 --> 02:42:39,020
alright so anyway sometimes you get to party with Japanese people right

1892
02:42:39,020 --> 02:42:42,100
well we have a Japanese person in our party

1893
02:42:42,100 --> 02:42:45,260
and then we invite this paladin who is

1894
02:42:45,260 --> 02:42:48,700
from the US and this is what she says and I quote when she finds out

1895
02:42:48,700 --> 02:42:52,780
that we have somebody who's Japanese in the party OMG

1896
02:42:52,780 --> 02:42:56,860
JP do they even speak American

1897
02:42:56,860 --> 02:43:00,100
I will leave unless they understand what I'm saying

1898
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:03,180
I will not die because of some JP player

1899
02:43:03,180 --> 02:43:06,100
who can't communicate with me.

1900
02:43:06,100 --> 02:43:07,600
Okay, first off, bitch.

1901
02:43:07,600 --> 02:43:10,600
It's called English, not American.

1902
02:43:10,600 --> 02:43:14,100
Okay? Second off, the game was designed

1903
02:43:14,100 --> 02:43:16,100
so that Japanese and English players can play together.

1904
02:43:16,100 --> 02:43:18,600
That's why you have something called the auto-translate function.

1905
02:43:18,600 --> 02:43:21,100
I suggest you learn how to use it.

1906
02:43:21,100 --> 02:43:24,100
Third off, you are a stupid bitch.

1907
02:43:24,100 --> 02:43:28,100
Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid bitch.

1908
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:29,100
Yes, Angel.

1909
02:43:29,100 --> 02:43:32,100
His hand is gonna laugh at this.

1910
02:43:32,100 --> 02:43:35,100
Blizzard, Bio, see ya, bye!

1911
02:43:35,100 --> 02:43:36,100
Yeah.

1912
02:43:36,100 --> 02:43:40,100
Anyway, that's it, so SniperKitten, F you.

1913
02:43:40,100 --> 02:43:41,100
Alright.

1914
02:43:41,100 --> 02:43:48,820
Jaded2005, moving on to the chatroom, Jaded2005 would like to say, F you to the Postal Service

1915
02:43:48,820 --> 02:43:52,780
for not delivering my Dance Mania CD sooner.

1916
02:43:52,780 --> 02:43:58,780
Phoenix says, I want to say F U Loki because he puts girls in the cage match which sucked

1917
02:43:58,780 --> 02:44:05,180
and I would like to say F U to the creator of DDR with Mario. Mario is dead! And he just

1918
02:44:05,180 --> 02:44:10,780
wants to add, yeah Loki sucked tonight. He must be a friend of yours or something.

1919
02:44:10,780 --> 02:44:13,780
Whatever girls is going in next week.

1920
02:44:13,780 --> 02:44:20,280
Alright. K-Dash says F U to dumb co-workers that you wish would go away. Dark Knight says

1921
02:44:20,280 --> 02:44:25,180
FU to my arm for being in so much pain after I went go-kart racing last night

1922
02:44:25,180 --> 02:44:29,240
and FU to myself for having a nightmare of a birthday being late for work on

1923
02:44:29,240 --> 02:44:29,920
Thursday

1924
02:44:29,920 --> 02:44:33,800
BRP Ohio Bamani says

1925
02:44:33,800 --> 02:44:37,960
FU to parents and grandparents that don't give the respect to their children and

1926
02:44:37,960 --> 02:44:38,640
grandchildren

1927
02:44:38,640 --> 02:44:42,440
children that they would expect back. FU to Viz

1928
02:44:42,440 --> 02:44:46,400
for holding on to Hikaru no Go anime license and not doing anything with it

1929
02:44:46,400 --> 02:44:47,280
since they got it

1930
02:44:47,280 --> 02:44:50,600
and F.U. to the ice storms that hit the East Coast last week.

1931
02:44:50,600 --> 02:44:56,480
L. Mowat says F.U. to any mission in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that involves

1932
02:44:56,480 --> 02:45:00,000
aircraft of any kind. The controls are way too sensitive

1933
02:45:00,000 --> 02:45:03,360
causing the plane to fly in weird directions when I thought I was going

1934
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:06,800
straight and doing barrel rolls and slightly leaning on the analog stick the

1935
02:45:06,800 --> 02:45:07,480
wrong way.

1936
02:45:07,480 --> 02:45:11,240
Whoever was in charge of designing the plane controls must have been drunk,

1937
02:45:11,240 --> 02:45:16,240
high, or both. VX Jason XV says

1938
02:45:16,240 --> 02:45:21,080
F you to being so freaking tired yes I'm freaking tired F you to my manager for

02:45:25,920 --> 02:45:31,480

1958
02:47:07,040 --> 02:47:09,040
tell the guy in your house to quit playing it.

1959
02:47:09,040 --> 02:47:14,040
Alright. There you have it.

1960
02:47:14,040 --> 02:47:18,500
Again, you can email TheLovelyDarkSakura by emailing

1961
02:47:18,500 --> 02:47:21,840
jamie.orensonsradio.com and it will forward to her usual address.

1962
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:25,440
Yes, it will. I verified it was set up this week.

1963
02:47:25,440 --> 02:47:28,560
So, unless you want to give your other one, I don't care.

1964
02:47:28,560 --> 02:47:31,800
Um, actually

1965
02:47:31,800 --> 02:47:35,000
you can either do it there or

1966
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:47,000
This one time only I'm going to give an email I can check from work. It's darksakra at delbiter.com.

1967
02:47:47,000 --> 02:47:49,000
This is the only time I'm giving this one out.

1968
02:47:49,000 --> 02:47:54,000
Ooh, okay. Quick stalker fans, write that down.

1969
02:47:54,000 --> 02:48:01,000
Alright. Anna did verify that yes it is indeed husband. My bad, my bad. What can I do?

1970
02:48:01,000 --> 02:48:08,000
I like the other guy that lives in your house. Come on, you have to admit that was a good one.

1971
02:48:08,000 --> 02:48:16,000
Alright, I got a file from DJ Ron Ma S who was so kind to find this file for me.

1972
02:48:16,000 --> 02:48:20,000
Remember earlier when we were talking about DDR featuring Mario?

1973
02:48:20,000 --> 02:48:25,000
Well, here's another song that needs to be in the game.

1974
02:48:25,000 --> 02:48:29,000
Do the Mario!

1975
02:48:29,000 --> 02:48:33,000
Swing your arms, from side to side, come on, it's time to go!

1976
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:37,000
Do the Mario! Take one step, and then again

1977
02:48:37,000 --> 02:48:41,000
Let's do the Mario! All together now!

1978
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:45,000
You got it! It's the Mario!

1979
02:48:45,000 --> 02:48:49,000
Do the Mario! Swing your arms,

1980
02:48:49,000 --> 02:48:53,000
From side to side, come on, it's time to go!

1981
02:48:53,000 --> 02:48:59,000
Mario takes one step, and then again let's do the Mario all together now!

1982
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Come on now, just like that!

1983
02:49:05,000 --> 02:49:07,000
Just like that!

1984
02:49:07,000 --> 02:49:09,000
He sounds like a cross between Cookie Monster and-

1985
02:49:09,000 --> 02:49:10,000
I'm just Captain Lou.

1986
02:49:10,000 --> 02:49:12,000
Oh god, he was awesome.

1987
02:49:12,000 --> 02:49:14,000
And he was Cyndi Lauper's dad in the videos.

1988
02:49:18,000 --> 02:49:19,000
Oh, the 80s.

1989
02:49:19,000 --> 02:49:27,640
Anyway, it's so funny looking at the chatroom and some people that freaking hate that song

1990
02:49:27,640 --> 02:49:30,840
and some people that really love it.

1991
02:49:30,840 --> 02:49:38,920
I like how L. Mullet puts it, cookie, cookie, I'm not doing the Mario.

1992
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:46,640
Alright, we're going to, if I didn't read your FU I didn't get one, so resend it I guess.

1993
02:49:46,640 --> 02:49:51,200
we'll read those when we come back. In the meantime we're gonna do one more

1994
02:49:51,200 --> 02:49:54,540
break. We're gonna do a quick break, a couple songs, and then we're gonna come

1995
02:49:54,540 --> 02:49:58,680
back and wrap up the show. That's right, it's time to wrap up the show. So I

1996
02:49:58,680 --> 02:50:01,720
thought I'd play something a little uptempo for you guys. I thought we'd play

1997
02:50:01,720 --> 02:50:05,240
a little bit of something from Guitar Freaks, and then we'll come back and get

1998
02:50:05,240 --> 02:50:12,240
we're ready to wrap up the show. We'll be back.

1999
02:50:35,240 --> 02:50:39,240
I'd like to steal those off the fireball, but it's out of control

2000
02:50:39,240 --> 02:50:44,240
Get to a tornado, soak the fireball, burn the sky like rock and roll

2001
02:50:44,240 --> 02:50:48,240
Get outta here!

2002
02:51:08,240 --> 02:51:12,240
Yeah, this is my transmission, nuclear fission, make them all go

2003
02:51:12,240 --> 02:51:15,740
I need a guy to see a fireball burnin' out of control

2004
02:51:15,740 --> 02:51:19,740
Findin' a ship, gettin' there and questin' that it's in a load

2005
02:51:19,740 --> 02:51:23,740
Beatin' an engine, beatin' a fireball, beatin' out of control

2006
02:51:24,740 --> 02:51:25,740
I'm gonna getcha!

2007
02:51:25,740 --> 02:51:32,740
Shout out to all the great fans who supported your team.

2008
02:51:32,740 --> 02:51:34,740
It's great, man!

2009
02:51:47,740 --> 02:51:51,740
Who can make waves all over town?

2010
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:55,740
When the TV comes, everybody dance around

2011
02:51:56,740 --> 02:52:01,740
Riverton can do the dolphin ragtime sound

2012
02:52:01,740 --> 02:52:25,740
I was a youth man, a turtle, not a tree I told you, darlin', can't get off the weed

2013
02:52:55,740 --> 02:53:04,600
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

2014
02:53:04,600 --> 02:53:14,200
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Listen to Orange Lounge Radio

2015
02:53:14,200 --> 02:53:18,680
Because Bongo demands it You know what?

2016
02:53:18,680 --> 02:53:23,120
I think our chat room tonight has turned into Jamie's personal hell, because like everybody

2017
02:53:23,120 --> 02:53:26,680
from our Final Fantasy XI Link show is coming in.

2018
02:53:26,680 --> 02:53:30,800
I wouldn't call it my own personal hell, you know, I wouldn't have had a problem with Final

2019
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:36,120
Fantasy XI had I received the support I needed.

2020
02:53:36,120 --> 02:53:37,120
It's a tough game.

2021
02:53:37,120 --> 02:53:38,120
It's tough.

2022
02:53:38,120 --> 02:53:41,760
I'm not saying it was tough, it's just, you know, on Ragnarok there were always people

2023
02:53:41,760 --> 02:53:43,760
playing.

2024
02:53:43,760 --> 02:53:52,240
I could easily go and level completely by myself, but anytime I ever came on and asked

2025
02:53:52,240 --> 02:53:55,240
I'm sorry, we're busy doing some dumbass class.

2026
02:53:55,240 --> 02:53:56,240
Hey, I tried, I tried.

2027
02:53:58,240 --> 02:53:59,240
I said forget it.

2028
02:54:01,240 --> 02:54:06,240
Let's see, what else was I going to say? I don't know, I had something else I was going to say.

2029
02:54:06,240 --> 02:54:08,240
Oh, I wanted to do some late FUs that came in.

2030
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:17,240
MPQ had some FUs he was trying to send me, but MIRC sucks for some reason, so FU to MIRC says MPQ.

2031
02:54:17,240 --> 02:54:20,240
But he says, here's the in a nutshell version of it.

2032
02:54:20,240 --> 02:54:26,240
Illusions never fixes their bimani, Smokers poison me, and Bill Masterman doesn't know much about how 2DX actually costs.

2033
02:54:26,240 --> 02:54:28,240
Those are all his FUs.

2034
02:54:31,240 --> 02:54:33,240
And, let's see, what was last here?

2035
02:54:33,240 --> 02:54:40,240
DJ Rama S says, I'm putting in my FU, still late, I don't care. FU to people returning iPods that work.

2036
02:54:40,240 --> 02:54:43,240
You retards, and FU to my computer for crashing.

2037
02:54:45,240 --> 02:54:46,240
Alright.

2038
02:54:46,240 --> 02:54:59,240
Wow, where'd it go? We're just about done with the show here. Any late, any other Bahmani news that you can think of that went on this week that I'm completely missing? I can't think of anything. You've been reading the boards though. Loki, anything you can think of?

2039
02:54:59,240 --> 02:55:16,240
Um, no. Nothing really. Actually, I've been paying more attention to building my computer than anything. I've been shopping a lot of that. And, um, I don't know. I've been, no, I haven't really been paying attention.

2040
02:55:16,240 --> 02:55:20,240
I mean, as far as there really hasn't been anything going on, though, that's the thing.

2041
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:24,240
And, I mean, other than, like, what, those two sim file tournaments that are going on,

2042
02:55:24,240 --> 02:55:29,240
which, I don't even know what the deal is with those, but I don't even really pay attention to those anymore,

2043
02:55:29,240 --> 02:55:32,240
because, you know, all the people that used to make good sim files stopped doing it.

2044
02:55:32,240 --> 02:55:37,240
It's just, like, it's gonna be a whole new resurgence of, you know, I guess before,

2045
02:55:37,240 --> 02:55:41,240
I mean, it wasn't exactly, he wasn't exactly good or anything, but, you know, there was, you know,

2046
02:55:41,240 --> 02:55:44,880
There was, you know, BemoniRuler and everyone was like, oh, I gotta get that stuff.

2047
02:55:44,880 --> 02:55:45,880
No, and then he left.

2048
02:55:45,880 --> 02:55:49,000
And then it was Utterdude, and then everyone was like, oh, I gotta get his stuff.

2049
02:55:49,000 --> 02:55:50,000
Then he's gone.

2050
02:55:50,000 --> 02:55:54,540
And now there's, you know, new people stepping in to take their place, and so it's just the

2051
02:55:54,540 --> 02:55:56,200
whole thing all over again.

2052
02:55:56,200 --> 02:56:00,800
But really, I think the problem is is because DDR Maniacs is down, and so you don't have

2053
02:56:00,800 --> 02:56:05,880
any, like, step mania updates, that's where all your theme stuff was, everything.

2054
02:56:05,880 --> 02:56:11,000
So that's probably why you're missing out on that stuff, and DDR UK is just not quite

2055
02:56:11,000 --> 02:56:14,520
up to you know that stuff I mean they're working hard on those official sim files

2056
02:56:14,520 --> 02:56:21,200
so that'll be fun once that comes out but um really not much I'm you know

2057
02:56:21,200 --> 02:56:29,240
downloading more material for remixing stuff with and I'm just trying to do

2058
02:56:29,240 --> 02:56:32,440
that kind of crap and then hopefully maybe crank something out I don't know

2059
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:38,720
but um I've thought of some other things but I don't want to commit to anything

2060
02:56:38,720 --> 02:56:43,520
because, you know, I hate, you know, starting projects after I haven't finished other projects.

2061
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:48,920
So, we'll see. I don't know. No news until there is news, I guess.

2062
02:56:50,920 --> 02:56:56,020
I'm just, I'm hoping the rumors are true that there's gonna be some type of new DDR game this year.

2063
02:56:56,020 --> 02:56:58,920
I mean, besides the Europe thing we already heard about. I mean, obviously there's that.

2064
02:56:58,920 --> 02:57:04,520
We'll find out about that pretty soon, actually. That should be, uh, by the end of next week?

2065
02:57:04,520 --> 02:57:10,640
Like, I'm hoping it's a sign of things to come from not only Japan, but the US as well.

2066
02:57:10,640 --> 02:57:11,820
At least something.

2067
02:57:11,820 --> 02:57:12,820
It's been too long.

2068
02:57:12,820 --> 02:57:14,480
DDR Extreme, we've been sitting on it too long.

2069
02:57:14,480 --> 02:57:16,000
We need something new.

2070
02:57:16,000 --> 02:57:17,280
We're foaming at the mouth here, people!

2071
02:57:17,280 --> 02:57:18,280
We need something new!

2072
02:57:18,280 --> 02:57:21,340
Otherwise, people are going to have to start importing machines from Europe.

2073
02:57:21,340 --> 02:57:22,340
What's with that?

2074
02:57:22,340 --> 02:57:26,140
Well, here is, I think, what the problem was, before it wasn't a matter of, you know, oh,

2075
02:57:26,140 --> 02:57:27,940
we just don't want to release another mix.

2076
02:57:27,940 --> 02:57:32,520
It was a heavy limits of their previous mix, and they had to develop something.

2077
02:57:32,520 --> 02:57:59,520
Kind of like, I'm not really sure with 9th style and 8th style if there was a lull between those, but it's like that. They just have to, you know, they have to kind of redesign everything from the ground up. That's why probably you haven't gotten anything. I mean, since, you know, their arcade division kind of fizzled out, you know, you have to design the hardware for it, and it's a little more difficult than just throwing a PC in there. So, I don't know. That's the only thing I can think of.

2078
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:04,160
DarkLionXVI sent me this link and I thought we had talked about this on a

2079
02:58:04,160 --> 02:58:07,160
previous show but maybe we missed it. I don't remember. I think we brought it up

2080
02:58:07,160 --> 02:58:11,080
briefly but the website has been updated here and there a little bit. It's

2081
02:58:11,080 --> 02:58:15,480
Karaoke Revolution Bamani Edition and this is coming out in Japan and you can

2082
02:58:15,480 --> 02:58:19,560
sing to pop in music hits and things like that. I don't know if

2083
02:58:19,560 --> 02:58:23,060
there is new stuff that they're putting in here. It looks like there might be a

2084
02:58:23,060 --> 02:58:26,160
few new songs in here. Yeah because I don't think like Mobomogo was in there

2085
02:58:26,160 --> 02:58:30,580
before and uh... kisi k and songs like that

2086
02:58:30,580 --> 02:58:33,760
looks like some new dez rose songs are going to be put in there

2087
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:37,480
very interesting the songs that they've decided to put in karaoke revolution

2088
02:58:37,480 --> 02:58:38,520
by money

2089
02:58:38,520 --> 02:58:43,200
one thing i notice on the site is that my rave on there you have a kidding me

2090
02:58:43,200 --> 02:58:47,060
uh... loki says that that would be cool though i don't think i see it on there

2091
02:58:47,060 --> 02:58:49,980
just a lot of a lot of popular music type songs are in there

2092
02:58:49,980 --> 02:58:53,300
i'm not just that though you can check out the uh... website over economy style

2093
02:58:53,300 --> 02:58:54,100
dot com

2094
02:58:54,100 --> 02:58:59,300
You notice, though, that Karaoke Revolution in Japan looks a lot different.

2095
02:58:59,300 --> 02:59:04,700
It's not the whole person singing on the stage thing or anything like that.

2096
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:08,420
It looks like basically a karaoke machine would.

2097
02:59:08,420 --> 02:59:10,180
Kind of not quite as flashy, I don't know.

2098
02:59:10,180 --> 02:59:11,180
Or maybe it is flashy.

2099
02:59:11,180 --> 02:59:12,440
I've got to see this game in motion, really.

2100
02:59:12,440 --> 02:59:15,820
But it doesn't look anything like Karaoke Revolution USA.

2101
02:59:15,820 --> 02:59:21,220
But if you like to sing, you can get on that.

2102
02:59:21,220 --> 02:59:22,220
I don't know.

2103
02:59:22,220 --> 02:59:25,220
They should port over their DDR karaoke mix.

2104
02:59:28,220 --> 02:59:34,220
Another thing that came out recently, which I have to actually update on our game here,

2105
02:59:34,220 --> 02:59:37,220
is Karaoke Revolution 3, which we have.

2106
02:59:37,220 --> 02:59:41,220
Cheat codes came out, so we can unlock all the songs, including Snake Eater.

2107
02:59:41,220 --> 02:59:42,220
Alright!

2108
02:59:42,220 --> 02:59:45,220
Snake Eater is the most ridiculous damn song in that game.

2109
02:59:45,220 --> 02:59:48,220
It can feast on a tree frog.

2110
02:59:49,220 --> 02:59:51,220
Best lyrics ever.

2111
02:59:51,220 --> 03:00:09,220
Oh, and, um, I hate Metal Gear Solid 3, cause, um, us nerds were not meant to be in, um, the jungle, therefore, putting us in the jungle does not work. I went into the jungle and I knew nothing of what I was doing. I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

2112
03:00:09,220 --> 03:00:11,220
What's the feast on a tree frog?

2113
03:00:11,220 --> 03:00:17,220
Well, alligator feasted on me, so yeah. That was the end of that.

2114
03:00:17,220 --> 03:00:23,220
Cause my fucking cheat codes wouldn't work. I wanted to Rambo my way through it, but it wouldn't let me.

2115
03:00:23,220 --> 03:00:25,220
These bastards.

2116
03:00:27,220 --> 03:00:31,220
Alright, it's getting down towards the end of the show guys, so gotta wrap it up.

2117
03:00:31,220 --> 03:00:35,220
Uh, final thoughts. We'll start off with Angel. Your final thought.

2118
03:00:35,220 --> 03:00:39,220
Um, I wanna go play Final Fantasy XI again.

2119
03:00:39,220 --> 03:00:40,220
Attic!

2120
03:00:40,220 --> 03:00:41,220
Hey!

2121
03:00:41,220 --> 03:00:42,220
Wait a minute!

2122
03:00:42,220 --> 03:00:44,940
You're the one that's gonna meet me tonight!

2123
03:00:44,940 --> 03:00:46,740
Final thought, Loki.

2124
03:00:46,740 --> 03:00:48,420
I hope more of my computer stuff comes in.

2125
03:00:48,420 --> 03:00:50,340
Actually, I hope all of it comes in this week.

2126
03:00:50,340 --> 03:00:51,600
Cause I have...

2127
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:54,980
I think everything's been ordered last week and it shouldn't take that long to ship.

2128
03:00:54,980 --> 03:01:01,140
I just hope all my stuff can come in so I can build it.

2129
03:01:01,140 --> 03:01:03,140
Kick you out of the chatroom?

2130
03:01:03,140 --> 03:01:04,140
Okay.

2131
03:01:04,140 --> 03:01:05,140
Uh...

2132
03:01:05,140 --> 03:01:07,700
Dark Sakura, your final thought?

2133
03:01:07,700 --> 03:01:12,380
I freakin' hate IRC.

2134
03:01:12,380 --> 03:01:17,400
And my final thought is, please tune in to Orange Launch Radio's other programming throughout

2135
03:01:17,400 --> 03:01:23,700
the week. Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday even, and then Friday over on DER Freak. Listen

2136
03:01:23,700 --> 03:01:27,380
to it! Or I'll cry.

2137
03:01:27,380 --> 03:01:35,660
Alright, that's it. The final word of tonight's show, one word to sum up everything.

2138
03:01:35,660 --> 03:01:37,660
Oh, you want it, Jamie?

2139
03:01:37,660 --> 03:01:39,660
Alright, Jamie, what's the final word?

2140
03:01:39,660 --> 03:01:41,660
Addict!

2141
03:01:41,660 --> 03:01:46,660
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

And now here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2145
03:04:29,660 --> 03:04:55,080
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2146
03:04:59,660 --> 03:05:19,700
Alright guys, we're back here, Orange Lounge Radio.

2147
03:05:19,700 --> 03:05:23,620
As a reminder, because I know a lot of you guys were off for the past couple weeks, we

2148
03:05:23,620 --> 03:05:27,780
are phasing out the afterbirth segment of the show just because we have other things

2149
03:05:27,780 --> 03:05:31,940
we have to take care of, um, after the shows now, so the afterbirths aren't gonna be around

2150
03:05:31,940 --> 03:05:36,860
a whole lot longer, and plus there will be no more post-show. Um, we'll go right back

2151
03:05:36,860 --> 03:05:41,380
into the Bamani Music and More program, featuring all your favorite DDR, 2DX, and Dance Mini

2152
03:05:41,380 --> 03:05:44,540
favorites. I know you guys might be sad about the loss of the afterbirth, but remember,

2153
03:05:44,540 --> 03:05:47,580
this is how we bring you these other projects that we're doing, like the podcast and things

2154
03:05:47,580 --> 03:05:52,980
like that. So don't cry! Don't cry for me, Argentina! Alright. Did you, did you just

2155
03:05:52,980 --> 03:05:56,900
think that? Alright. Nellie's finally saying something, even though the show's over.

2156
03:05:56,900 --> 03:05:59,280
What exactly all right?

2157
03:06:00,180 --> 03:06:02,760
So that's it. We're now going to go back to

2158
03:06:02,760 --> 03:06:05,880
Back to Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music-
