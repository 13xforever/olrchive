[SPEAKER_21]: Call me Daddy.

[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.

9
00:05:10,183 --> 00:05:13,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

10
00:05:14,005 --> 00:05:15,406
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, isn't that special?

[SPEAKER_28]: And this is episode number 126 for this

14

[SPEAKER_28]: January the 9th of 2005.

15
00:05:52,713 --> 00:05:59,877
[SPEAKER_28]: You're tuned into the B... Money Scenes.

16
00:06:00,877 --> 00:06:02,878
[SPEAKER_28]: Most minty station of all things money.

17
00:06:03,939 --> 00:06:05,099
[SPEAKER_28]: My name is Rob Roberts.

18
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,680
[SPEAKER_28]: You might know me as Sky.

19
00:06:07,521 --> 00:06:09,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

20
00:06:09,962 --> 00:06:11,823
[SPEAKER_28]: In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.

21
00:06:11,923 --> 00:06:13,644
[SPEAKER_28]: Say hello to DarkSakura.

22
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:15,325
[SPEAKER_28]: You know her maybe as Jamie Summers.

23
00:06:16,385 --> 00:06:16,786
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fire.

24
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:19,751
[SPEAKER_28]: Fire is very cool.

25
00:06:19,811 --> 00:06:20,432
[SPEAKER_28]: I do like fire.

26
00:06:20,512 --> 00:06:22,694
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched Mr. Show today.

27
00:06:23,834 --> 00:06:26,216
[SPEAKER_28]: What have you set on fire this week, Jamie?

28
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:26,977
[SPEAKER_28]: Just out of curiosity.

29
00:06:26,997 --> 00:06:27,417
[SPEAKER_09]: Candles.

30
00:06:27,898 --> 00:06:28,138
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, okay.

31
00:06:28,378 --> 00:06:29,399
[SPEAKER_09]: They smelled like pears.

32
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:30,140
[SPEAKER_28]: That's something.

33
00:06:31,501 --> 00:06:33,282
[SPEAKER_09]: I played Sunday Money this week.

34
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we're going to get into that definitely when we get into How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day.

35
00:06:36,986 --> 00:06:38,227
[SPEAKER_28]: You should light a pear on fire.

36
00:06:38,267 --> 00:06:39,047
[SPEAKER_28]: I wonder what that would do.

37
00:06:40,048 --> 00:06:43,791
[SPEAKER_09]: It wouldn't catch fire because of the moisture in the pear.

38
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:45,753
[SPEAKER_09]: You catch the stem on fire, maybe.

39
00:06:46,283 --> 00:06:51,206
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, if you threw it in the fireplace, that might be like a lot of fire where the moisture would put it out.

40
00:06:51,266 --> 00:06:53,467
[SPEAKER_09]: But not enough.

41
00:06:53,528 --> 00:06:59,951
[SPEAKER_09]: It would still... Seriously?

42
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:02,693
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm full of good ideas here.

43
00:07:02,733 --> 00:07:05,455
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, we're going to have roasted pears with butter and cinnamon.

44
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:07,256
[SPEAKER_09]: Stay on Iron Chef.

45
00:07:07,276 --> 00:07:07,876
[SPEAKER_09]: We're a battle.

46
00:07:07,916 --> 00:07:08,577
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm a genius.

47
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:13,580
[SPEAKER_28]: Also joining us, the other co-host, you know him...

48
00:07:14,485 --> 00:07:17,426
[SPEAKER_28]: The angry, the bitter, the tech massa, Loki!

49
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:19,827
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

50
00:07:23,368 --> 00:07:27,270
[SPEAKER_28]: And we never say his stage name, but it's Matt Blackman, by the way.

51
00:07:27,630 --> 00:07:28,670
[SPEAKER_28]: Just in case you were curious.

52
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

53
00:07:30,811 --> 00:07:33,232
[SPEAKER_28]: Also joining us tonight, we have one special guest.

54
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:36,993
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, actually we have two, but one of them never talks, so we just don't acknowledge her.

55
00:07:38,170 --> 00:07:38,590
[SPEAKER_09]: DDRAngel

56
00:08:06,363 --> 00:08:06,663
[SPEAKER_10]: Hello.

57
00:08:06,964 --> 00:08:07,104
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah.

58
00:08:09,566 --> 00:08:10,927
[SPEAKER_10]: I almost killed myself with the cord.

59
00:08:11,147 --> 00:08:11,268
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah!

60
00:08:11,928 --> 00:08:15,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Those that know her pretty well, though, know that she's actually DDR Devil.

61
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:17,934
[SPEAKER_10]: Bastard, I am not.

62
00:08:20,476 --> 00:08:21,057
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, great.

63
00:08:21,617 --> 00:08:24,079
[SPEAKER_28]: There's the devil right there in ferret form.

64
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:25,921
[SPEAKER_10]: So, do I have a name yet?

65
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:28,864
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you?

66
00:08:29,024 --> 00:08:29,364
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

67
00:08:29,424 --> 00:08:30,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have a name?

68
00:08:31,963 --> 00:08:32,384
[SPEAKER_10]: Tell me.

69
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:33,186
[SPEAKER_10]: Just Angel.

70
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:34,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's just Angel.

71
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:34,729
[SPEAKER_10]: Fine.

72
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:35,971
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a label anymore.

73
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:36,973
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel of the morning.

74
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:38,376
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Angel Devilman.

75
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Or Deviled Angel.

76
00:08:41,181 --> 00:08:43,285
[SPEAKER_28]: I like those paradoxes.

77
00:08:43,345 --> 00:08:43,546
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

78
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:48,944
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we got a fun show for you tonight.

79
00:08:49,024 --> 00:08:49,724
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, we don't.

80
00:08:49,744 --> 00:08:52,446
[SPEAKER_28]: We have a mediocre show, but it's packaged as a good show.

81
00:08:52,527 --> 00:08:55,509
[SPEAKER_28]: No, it's going to be a good show as always.

82
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,230
[SPEAKER_28]: Lots of things to talk about.

83
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:03,115
[SPEAKER_28]: As Jamie mentioned there, she's actually played some Bomani this week, so we got to talk about that, among other Bomani things.

84
00:09:03,896 --> 00:09:06,338
[SPEAKER_28]: Huge Bomani news going on in the scene this week.

85
00:09:06,358 --> 00:09:07,479
[SPEAKER_28]: We got to talk about this.

86
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:08,479
[SPEAKER_28]: You know this is going to be big.

87
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:12,823
[SPEAKER_28]: Also, we want to talk about the brand new...

88
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,341
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio Production.

89
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,781
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a brand new show.

90
00:09:17,221 --> 00:09:18,722
[SPEAKER_28]: You may not have even heard of this yet.

91
00:09:18,742 --> 00:09:20,002
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to tell you guys all about it.

92
00:09:20,062 --> 00:09:20,723
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so cool.

93
00:09:21,583 --> 00:09:22,803
[SPEAKER_28]: All of that when we get back from this break.

94
00:09:22,823 --> 00:09:23,824
[SPEAKER_09]: It's called Fun With Butter.

95
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:26,365
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right.

96
00:09:26,525 --> 00:09:27,545
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Fun With Butter.

97
00:09:28,085 --> 00:09:33,127
[SPEAKER_28]: And we just take DDR Angel and we just douse her in butter and then cook her.

98
00:09:34,948 --> 00:09:35,428
[SPEAKER_10]: Ah, shit.

99
00:09:35,468 --> 00:09:36,728
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you going to light me on fire?

100
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:38,549
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

101
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:43,022
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's have DDR Angel hold pears and then set it on fire.

102
00:09:43,042 --> 00:09:44,383
[SPEAKER_28]: We're being very random tonight.

103
00:09:45,803 --> 00:09:47,784
[SPEAKER_10]: Let my blackmates light you on fire.

104
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:49,005
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

105
00:09:49,485 --> 00:09:51,646
[SPEAKER_26]: It's going to be one of those shows, folks.

106
00:09:51,807 --> 00:09:53,267
[SPEAKER_26]: One of those shows.

107
00:09:53,948 --> 00:09:54,268
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

108
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:58,310
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll talk about all that fun stuff when we come back from this break.

109
00:09:58,954 --> 00:10:07,918
[SPEAKER_28]: In this break, we're going to feature music from 2DX, but Jamie requested that we play some 2DX songs that you don't normally hear us play.

110
00:10:08,338 --> 00:10:11,079
[SPEAKER_28]: So these are underappreciated 2DX songs.

111
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:15,821
[SPEAKER_28]: And we're going to start it off with a little ditty from Slake called I'm For Real.

112
00:10:15,861 --> 00:10:16,782
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back after this.

113
00:10:18,663 --> 00:10:19,103
I'm For Real

114
00:11:52,543 --> 00:11:54,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

115
00:13:24,733 --> 00:13:25,219
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

116
00:14:32,245 --> 00:14:33,167
Thanks for watching!

117
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:02,912
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

118
00:16:02,972 --> 00:16:07,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Rhythm and music gaming and video games that don't suck.

119
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:07,975
[SPEAKER_13]: And some that do.

120
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,449
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

121
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,282
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it just me, or I kind of feel what they're saying.

122
00:16:47,302 --> 00:16:50,465
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a lot of real elitist 2DX players out there.

123
00:16:50,745 --> 00:16:54,008
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, now, I've always been one that says, you know, just play the damn game.

124
00:16:54,248 --> 00:16:55,229
[SPEAKER_28]: Just have fun with the game.

125
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:57,031
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why they make it for the home.

126
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,592
[SPEAKER_28]: You can play in the privacy of your own home.

127
00:16:58,652 --> 00:17:03,356
[SPEAKER_28]: Mostly arcades don't even have the game anyway, so you don't have to be intimidated or worry about anything.

128
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,717
[SPEAKER_28]: But what's up with that?

129
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:06,579
[SPEAKER_28]: Why do people get elitist over 2DX?

130
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:07,379
[SPEAKER_28]: Any ideas?

131
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:09,801
[SPEAKER_28]: No?

132
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:10,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, any thoughts?

133
00:17:11,683 --> 00:17:11,903
[SPEAKER_09]: This is...

134
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:18,334
[SPEAKER_09]: Because people have to have something to feel good about themselves, and if they suck at everything else in life, they have to at least be good at 2DX, I don't know.

135
00:17:19,414 --> 00:17:32,662
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, no, I know some good 2DX players that don't suck at life, they're very good at life, and they just happen to be good at 2DX too, but some people, man, it's like, I don't know, instead of having a humongous internet penis, they feel the need to have a humongous 2DX penis.

136
00:17:33,663 --> 00:17:35,944
[SPEAKER_28]: And this, you know, this could be a girl too, don't, you know.

137
00:17:36,772 --> 00:17:39,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Although I actually don't know a whole lot of girls that play 2DX.

138
00:17:39,533 --> 00:17:42,453
[SPEAKER_28]: I know some, and some that are quite good, like Jamie.

139
00:17:42,793 --> 00:17:43,713
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie plays 2DX.

140
00:17:44,274 --> 00:17:45,314
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel plays a little 2DX.

141
00:17:47,194 --> 00:17:47,814
[SPEAKER_28]: I am not good.

142
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:53,655
[SPEAKER_28]: But see, that's the whole thing right there, is that you feel like you're not good compared to what?

143
00:17:55,756 --> 00:17:57,216
[SPEAKER_09]: Compared to other people in general?

144
00:17:57,316 --> 00:18:04,098
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what, but any old person walking up the street, if you were to play 2DX for that person, they'd probably go, wow, she's hitting a lot of buttons.

145
00:18:04,398 --> 00:18:05,418
[SPEAKER_09]: It's relative, but I'm...

146
00:18:06,365 --> 00:18:11,289
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, my skill has depreciated a bit at the game, just with lack of practice.

147
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:13,151
[SPEAKER_28]: So has mine, oh my gosh.

148
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:19,115
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell you what, if you don't keep practicing these music games, these rhythm beat games, you'll lose it.

149
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,396
[SPEAKER_28]: Boy, do you ever.

150
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:21,217
[SPEAKER_28]: It's sad.

151
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:31,165
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, anyway, let's not get too off topic because we've got to start off tonight's show as we start off every week's show playing a little game, and that game is How was your week?

152
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:32,046
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

153
00:18:32,967 --> 00:18:34,088
[SPEAKER_28]: Dark Sakura, how was your week?

154
00:18:34,108 --> 00:18:34,468
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

155
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,742
[SPEAKER_09]: I played some 2DX.

156
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:39,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, then you can't beat that out of practice.

157
00:18:39,225 --> 00:18:48,753
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, just a little, but my week's been, it's been a really fucked up week because this is my second to last week at my job.

158
00:18:49,434 --> 00:18:52,357
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I got promoted, going back to where I was before.

159
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,197
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations.

160
00:18:53,297 --> 00:18:53,638
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

161
00:18:53,898 --> 00:18:55,019
[SPEAKER_09]: Get a nice raise out of it, too.

162
00:18:55,159 --> 00:18:56,280
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, raises rock.

163
00:18:58,627 --> 00:19:02,010
[SPEAKER_28]: Now you can buy more useless video game garbage you'll only play one time.

164
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,812
[SPEAKER_09]: This money is getting saved up for my house.

165
00:19:04,632 --> 00:19:08,576
[SPEAKER_28]: So you can have more places to keep all your useless video games.

166
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:09,877
[SPEAKER_09]: Precisely.

167
00:19:10,177 --> 00:19:11,798
[SPEAKER_28]: None of your stuff is useless though, Jamie.

168
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:12,779
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm talking in general.

169
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,743
[SPEAKER_28]: I would never make fun of the DarkSakura Museum of Video Gaming.

170
00:19:18,264 --> 00:19:21,686
[SPEAKER_09]: Museum is right, although it's all in boxes most of the places.

171
00:19:22,067 --> 00:19:23,568
[SPEAKER_09]: We're going to be getting rid of a lot of our toys soon.

172
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:25,790
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you going to put it on eBay?

173
00:19:26,169 --> 00:19:28,511
[SPEAKER_09]: No, we're probably just going to give them away to some charity or something.

174
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:29,112
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm charity.

175
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:33,636
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, do you want a bunch of Ronin Warriors and Exo Squad toys?

176
00:19:33,816 --> 00:19:34,796
[SPEAKER_28]: I would never.

177
00:19:34,837 --> 00:19:39,360
[SPEAKER_09]: They re-released a bunch of the Macross toys as Exo Squad toys, and we have them.

178
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,544
[SPEAKER_28]: We should give them away as prizes on the show.

179
00:19:43,564 --> 00:19:45,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I did!

180
00:19:45,145 --> 00:19:48,548
[SPEAKER_09]: I did manage to get more V-Rares.

181
00:19:49,189 --> 00:19:52,732
[SPEAKER_09]: More copies of the EX and Ultra Mix V-Rares.

182
00:19:53,840 --> 00:20:02,122
[SPEAKER_09]: So I have three of each, and maybe doing something with those as far as prize-related things.

183
00:20:03,262 --> 00:20:03,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

184
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,682
[SPEAKER_09]: Excuse me.

185
00:20:06,122 --> 00:20:13,284
[SPEAKER_09]: I've also had this burning spot at the back of my throat, just like a little rough spot, so my voice has been kind of, uh, all day.

186
00:20:13,944 --> 00:20:14,884
[SPEAKER_09]: I saw The Grudge again.

187
00:20:15,664 --> 00:20:16,044
[SPEAKER_25]: How was that?

188
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:16,524
[SPEAKER_09]: In the theater.

189
00:20:17,244 --> 00:20:20,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it would have been great, except for the morons talking behind us, so...

190
00:20:20,618 --> 00:20:25,220
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend turns around, this is at the Sunrise Theater, she turns around and says, do you want me to beat you in the head?

191
00:20:26,581 --> 00:20:28,582
[SPEAKER_28]: That was almost like my experience when I went and saw The Grudge.

192
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,282
[SPEAKER_09]: This was right at the beginning of the movie.

193
00:20:30,622 --> 00:20:32,403
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh no, this was towards the end when I saw it.

194
00:20:33,544 --> 00:20:42,448
[SPEAKER_28]: And there was this guy, this like jock guy sitting in the back going, and I turn around and go, well the guy with the little penis in the back row, please shut up.

195
00:20:43,783 --> 00:20:46,965
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, there was this one kid that just started belching in the last half of the movie.

196
00:20:47,485 --> 00:20:50,808
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm like, wow, it must be special to be able to burp in a movie.

197
00:20:50,828 --> 00:20:51,948
[SPEAKER_09]: Only retards do that.

198
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,130
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he stopped.

199
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,353
[SPEAKER_09]: It was just a little... His mom was there, too.

200
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,755
[SPEAKER_09]: So I felt like making a comment about how she raised her children.

201
00:21:02,815 --> 00:21:04,196
[SPEAKER_26]: Isn't your mother proud of you now?

202
00:21:06,838 --> 00:21:07,599
[SPEAKER_09]: But anyway...

203
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,698
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just been a very weird week.

204
00:21:10,758 --> 00:21:17,843
[SPEAKER_09]: And like Friday was also my boss's boss, who is the AVP in our department, her last day.

205
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:23,828
[SPEAKER_09]: And we just ended up talking about stuff in general about... How last days rock.

206
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:28,271
[SPEAKER_09]: About our opinion of certain people, you know.

207
00:21:28,731 --> 00:21:30,873
[SPEAKER_09]: And just in general, and I hardly touched the phone.

208
00:21:30,913 --> 00:21:32,033
[SPEAKER_09]: I took like 20 calls all day.

209
00:21:32,934 --> 00:21:33,955
[SPEAKER_09]: I ate carrot cake.

210
00:21:36,096 --> 00:21:38,358
[SPEAKER_09]: And I did body sculpting for the first time on Tuesday.

211
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:42,391
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was so sore, but I was like, Mom, I'm going to go spin the next day.

212
00:21:42,411 --> 00:21:44,731
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to be a good little workoutaholic.

213
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:47,212
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh my God, I was in such pain.

214
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:48,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go Thursday.

215
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:49,372
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go Friday.

216
00:21:49,552 --> 00:21:50,712
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't go yesterday.

217
00:21:51,333 --> 00:21:52,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I did crap.

218
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,813
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like my DDR diet.

219
00:21:53,873 --> 00:21:56,294
[SPEAKER_28]: I played like four days in a row, and then I didn't play for five.

220
00:21:56,454 --> 00:21:57,354
[SPEAKER_28]: And then I played yesterday.

221
00:21:58,394 --> 00:21:59,674
[SPEAKER_09]: I played PSO last night.

222
00:22:00,474 --> 00:22:01,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And on the internet.

223
00:22:01,975 --> 00:22:02,815
[SPEAKER_09]: And went to TapX.

224
00:22:04,135 --> 00:22:07,616
[SPEAKER_09]: I went to the new TapX on... There's a new TapX?

225
00:22:08,095 --> 00:22:09,396
[SPEAKER_09]: Hell, no, on Hell.

226
00:22:12,397 --> 00:22:14,899
[SPEAKER_09]: It intersects with Hell off of Fair Oaks.

227
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:15,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Off Fair Oaks, actually.

228
00:22:16,699 --> 00:22:17,760
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, I didn't even know there was a new one.

229
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,681
[SPEAKER_09]: It's tucked away back there, but they have fish balls on the menu.

230
00:22:20,121 --> 00:22:24,924
[SPEAKER_09]: And they have real spring rolls, like the Vietnamese-style spring rolls, with the thin wraps.

231
00:22:25,084 --> 00:22:28,786
[SPEAKER_25]: For those that don't have Tap-X, what's Tap-X, for those that may not know?

232
00:22:28,826 --> 00:22:29,426
[SPEAKER_09]: Tapioca Express.

233
00:22:29,786 --> 00:22:35,409
[SPEAKER_09]: It's basically, you can get all kinds of tea, juices, and milk tea, coffee...

234
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:36,434
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

235
00:23:04,727 --> 00:23:07,988
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, Angel's got some balls... Kind of sticky and squishy.

236
00:23:08,108 --> 00:23:09,948
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel's got some balls mints with her right now.

237
00:23:09,968 --> 00:23:11,088
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll have to put these on cam.

238
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,949
[SPEAKER_28]: So I can put Angel's balls in my mouth, which I think I'm going to do right now.

239
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,110
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to look politely in the other direction.

240
00:23:20,290 --> 00:23:21,230
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, look, ferret!

241
00:23:24,671 --> 00:23:26,292
[SPEAKER_26]: Anything else you want to share about your week and your day?

242
00:23:27,292 --> 00:23:28,332
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, no.

243
00:23:28,572 --> 00:23:28,752
[SPEAKER_09]: Bye.

244
00:23:31,513 --> 00:23:32,813
[SPEAKER_28]: Alrighty, let's move on to Loki!

245
00:23:32,853 --> 00:23:33,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki!

246
00:23:34,332 --> 00:23:35,693
[SPEAKER_28]: Logi, how was your week?

247
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:36,333
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day, Logi?

248
00:23:37,794 --> 00:23:38,674
[SPEAKER_24]: My week was alright.

249
00:23:39,074 --> 00:23:40,755
[SPEAKER_24]: I've been buying stuff.

250
00:23:41,996 --> 00:23:45,037
[SPEAKER_24]: Stuff for my project, my other project.

251
00:23:45,337 --> 00:23:48,639
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, you know, all the other projects I start without finishing the other ones.

252
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,180
[SPEAKER_24]: But this one should be done pretty quick, though, because it's a small one.

253
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:58,543
[SPEAKER_24]: But everything to build my micro-ITX PC that's going to be inside of an Xbox.

254
00:23:59,664 --> 00:24:01,285
[SPEAKER_24]: That's going to be for our roadshows.

255
00:24:02,586 --> 00:24:03,207
[SPEAKER_24]: So I have it all.

256
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:05,450
[SPEAKER_24]: Right now most of it is stacked on that table right there.

257
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:09,637
[SPEAKER_24]: But everything else is still coming in for it.

258
00:24:09,777 --> 00:24:11,640
[SPEAKER_24]: The only thing I have left to purchase on is Ram.

259
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:12,501
[SPEAKER_24]: And then...

260
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:42,380
[SPEAKER_24]: Any other peripherals that plug into it And then, you know, any other miscellaneous case modding crap I want to do to it So I have that And then, this week I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy That type of stuff Also been playing a lot of the Guy game, actually Which is quite funny Because it's a fun trivia game with boobies in it And, let's see what else Oh, just, you know, watched a few movies And that kind of thing

261
00:24:43,576 --> 00:24:44,856
[SPEAKER_24]: Overall, pretty easy week.

262
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:50,538
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um... Yeah, that's all that's pretty much been going on.

263
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:51,698
[SPEAKER_24]: Just that kind of stuff.

264
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:04,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and my week and my day was, um... Okay, I guess I had a very lazy day.

265
00:25:04,741 --> 00:25:06,582
[SPEAKER_28]: I've had a very lazy weekend, come to think of it.

266
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:08,322
[SPEAKER_28]: I really done crap this weekend.

267
00:25:08,342 --> 00:25:10,262
[SPEAKER_28]: I played a lot of Final Fantasy, that's for sure.

268
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:11,863
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict!

269
00:25:12,003 --> 00:25:12,363
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

270
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:19,977
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright, we've sucked DDR Angel into our little addiction and soon you will be next.

271
00:25:19,997 --> 00:25:23,240
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I tried that little addiction, you know what?

272
00:25:23,780 --> 00:25:25,481
[SPEAKER_09]: It was crap, so I stopped playing.

273
00:25:25,581 --> 00:25:27,703
[SPEAKER_28]: As long as you didn't ditch us for World of Warcraft.

274
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:30,385
[SPEAKER_10]: Should we tell her about the character problem?

275
00:25:30,645 --> 00:25:30,905
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops.

276
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:36,970
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, let's see, what else was I going to say?

277
00:25:36,990 --> 00:25:37,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

278
00:25:38,024 --> 00:25:38,985
[SPEAKER_28]: Death's the best part

279
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,554
[SPEAKER_28]: well, not when you're the one that's dying

280
00:26:09,431 --> 00:26:15,533
[SPEAKER_28]: When you're killing other people, it's okay, but I was the one that kept dying, so... I don't know, I just went back into Final Fantasy XI where I don't die as much.

281
00:26:16,794 --> 00:26:21,915
[SPEAKER_28]: But I got to play Halo 2 last night, and I forgot that it actually can be a lot of fun when you're killing your friends.

282
00:26:22,536 --> 00:26:36,901
[SPEAKER_28]: So, I need to, like, have a Halo 2 night or something, where I set aside a night and play Halo 2, because it's much more fun to play with your friends than it is to play strangers on Xbox Live, who are, like, a gazillion times better than you are, and just get on there and say...

283
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:40,423
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna shoot you down, faggot.

284
00:26:40,523 --> 00:26:41,503
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm gonna kill you.

285
00:26:43,145 --> 00:26:45,126
[SPEAKER_16]: Nigga, I'm the best one at this game.

286
00:26:47,087 --> 00:26:49,849
[SPEAKER_28]: And I swear, people on Xbox Live, they talk just like that.

287
00:26:49,889 --> 00:26:51,010
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not even exaggerating.

288
00:26:51,070 --> 00:26:54,112
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you're offended by what I said, just go on Xbox Live.

289
00:26:54,152 --> 00:26:54,573
[SPEAKER_28]: It's worse.

290
00:26:57,455 --> 00:27:00,357
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, what else is going on?

291
00:27:00,657 --> 00:27:00,977
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

292
00:27:01,017 --> 00:27:03,919
[SPEAKER_28]: I was kind of hoping to do a little bit of traveling this weekend, but that didn't happen.

293
00:27:03,959 --> 00:27:06,501
[SPEAKER_28]: But next weekend is a three-day weekend.

294
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:11,819
[SPEAKER_28]: So I don't know if it's going to be a drunk show Sunday night or if I'm going to go out after the show next Sunday.

295
00:27:12,819 --> 00:27:14,220
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll drink if someone can get me home.

296
00:27:14,981 --> 00:27:15,401
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

297
00:27:15,421 --> 00:27:16,241
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll have to see what we can do.

298
00:27:16,361 --> 00:27:17,662
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's a three-day weekend for me next week.

299
00:27:17,702 --> 00:27:18,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing hooky on Friday, too.

300
00:27:18,963 --> 00:27:20,664
[SPEAKER_28]: Our work celebrates Martin Luther King Day.

301
00:27:21,104 --> 00:27:22,065
[SPEAKER_28]: So we get it off.

302
00:27:22,425 --> 00:27:22,905
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.

303
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,067
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, speaking of that, if I can add one more thing.

304
00:27:26,487 --> 00:27:26,808
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.

305
00:27:27,028 --> 00:27:29,029
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to the Skywalker Ranch on Friday.

306
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:30,390
[SPEAKER_28]: What for?

307
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,371
[SPEAKER_09]: My friend works for LucasArts.

308
00:27:33,843 --> 00:27:35,264
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm going to do school stuff that morning.

309
00:27:35,284 --> 00:27:37,704
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm playing hooky anyway on Friday, on my last day.

310
00:27:38,345 --> 00:27:40,305
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're going to the Skywalker Ranch for lunch.

311
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:43,667
[SPEAKER_28]: You should take some business cards.

312
00:27:44,927 --> 00:27:45,687
[SPEAKER_09]: Give me some business cards.

313
00:27:45,707 --> 00:27:46,168
[SPEAKER_28]: We can find some.

314
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:46,888
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, anyway.

315
00:27:46,908 --> 00:27:48,509
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, I just wanted to throw that in.

316
00:27:48,529 --> 00:27:50,989
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoring out Orange Lounge Radio everywhere we can.

317
00:27:52,690 --> 00:27:55,531
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess that's all I really have to say about my week and my day, and not a whole lot.

318
00:27:55,651 --> 00:27:56,552
[SPEAKER_28]: I did see some movies.

319
00:27:57,232 --> 00:28:01,053
[SPEAKER_28]: I saw that movie Finding Neverland, which is kind of like an artsy film that's up for Golden Globes.

320
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:01,994
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good.

321
00:28:02,474 --> 00:28:02,994
[SPEAKER_28]: Very good film.

322
00:28:03,447 --> 00:28:04,807
[SPEAKER_28]: If you like Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.

323
00:28:05,748 --> 00:28:06,288
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, that's it.

324
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,068
[SPEAKER_28]: Enough of me, I'm boring.

325
00:28:08,629 --> 00:28:09,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, how was your week?

326
00:28:09,389 --> 00:28:09,749
[SPEAKER_28]: How was your day?

327
00:28:10,649 --> 00:28:11,950
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm even more boring, so there.

328
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,530
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me.

329
00:28:15,070 --> 00:28:15,431
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see.

330
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:23,353
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I guess for the gaggy part of my week, because I know you guys are all going to gag and go, oh, not.

331
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:27,774
[SPEAKER_10]: Magus and I celebrated our two year anniversary, so yay.

332
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:30,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh!

333
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:32,224
[SPEAKER_10]: See, he told you.

334
00:28:32,645 --> 00:28:35,987
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, I also played a lot of Final Fantasy XI.

335
00:28:36,027 --> 00:28:37,148
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you, Rob.

336
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:38,228
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey!

337
00:28:41,350 --> 00:28:43,512
[SPEAKER_10]: And, yeah, signed up for school.

338
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,313
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow, that was expensive.

339
00:28:45,513 --> 00:28:45,933
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well.

340
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:48,635
[SPEAKER_10]: Not as expensive as Jamie's, I'm sure, but still.

341
00:28:51,037 --> 00:28:52,838
[SPEAKER_10]: Because she's taking a lot more classes than I am.

342
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:54,919
[SPEAKER_09]: How many classes are you taking?

343
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:55,440
[SPEAKER_09]: Three.

344
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:56,861
[SPEAKER_10]: How many units?

345
00:28:57,301 --> 00:28:59,382
[SPEAKER_10]: Three, because there are only one unit classes each.

346
00:28:59,522 --> 00:29:00,323
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

347
00:29:00,836 --> 00:29:02,477
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking four three-unit classes.

348
00:29:02,957 --> 00:29:04,218
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, no one's a two.

349
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, it's not my full-time.

350
00:29:06,439 --> 00:29:08,239
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm working full-time.

351
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:10,701
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I got that too, so.

352
00:29:11,581 --> 00:29:11,801
[SPEAKER_10]: Hmm?

353
00:29:12,702 --> 00:29:13,462
[SPEAKER_10]: I got that too.

354
00:29:14,622 --> 00:29:18,164
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, I've got work too and all that stuff, so.

355
00:29:19,565 --> 00:29:22,226
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, I didn't really do much this week.

356
00:29:22,906 --> 00:29:25,067
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I'm more boring than Rob is.

357
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,449
[SPEAKER_28]: As if that's possible.

358
00:29:29,857 --> 00:29:36,903
[SPEAKER_28]: I forgot to say, one other thing I did is that I went to the bookstore, Borders Books, and I got a book about starting your own business.

359
00:29:36,923 --> 00:29:37,463
[SPEAKER_28]: You can read?

360
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:39,765
[SPEAKER_28]: Amazingly enough, I can.

361
00:29:41,587 --> 00:29:45,350
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought that if you were a corporate trainer, you couldn't read and had bad grammar.

362
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:46,911
[SPEAKER_28]: Very funny, very funny.

363
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:55,251
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, well, I have horrible handwriting, so whenever I write on the board, for those who don't know, my day job is I'm a corporate trainer.

364
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:57,472
[SPEAKER_28]: And when I write on the board, it's very yucky.

365
00:29:57,512 --> 00:29:58,753
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why I like to use PowerPoint.

366
00:29:59,773 --> 00:30:05,735
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very much a tease because I have known some where I work who have the worst grammar ever.

367
00:30:06,155 --> 00:30:08,056
[SPEAKER_28]: I am the best corporate trainer you'll ever have.

368
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:08,856
[SPEAKER_09]: You are the best.

369
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:11,057
[SPEAKER_28]: You should come work where I work.

370
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:15,399
[SPEAKER_09]: If you give me a job making what I'm going to be making in my new position, sure.

371
00:30:17,225 --> 00:30:19,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Everybody should come work where I work.

372
00:30:19,207 --> 00:30:21,689
[SPEAKER_28]: Except I'm not going to tell you where I work because I don't need any more stalkers.

373
00:30:23,971 --> 00:30:24,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

374
00:30:25,192 --> 00:30:27,014
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, so I got the book on starting your own business.

375
00:30:27,074 --> 00:30:30,257
[SPEAKER_28]: So that, you know, because we're thinking about it with Orange Launch Radio.

376
00:30:30,277 --> 00:30:30,938
[SPEAKER_28]: We're thinking about it.

377
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:32,519
[SPEAKER_28]: We're thinking about it.

378
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:35,222
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually making this legit.

379
00:30:35,282 --> 00:30:37,083
[SPEAKER_28]: We've been doing it for, what, two and a half years now?

380
00:30:37,124 --> 00:30:38,465
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's about time to make this legit.

381
00:30:39,526 --> 00:30:41,688
[SPEAKER_28]: We've always been in the business to sex you up.

382
00:30:47,382 --> 00:30:49,171
[SPEAKER_28]: on that note I think we're going to go to a break

383
00:30:50,934 --> 00:31:20,318
[SPEAKER_28]: and when we come back from this break I know we got a list list we want to do tonight I know we've got something that new project we want to plug for those that haven't figured it out we got a cage match we want to do we got big DDR news very full plate for us when we come back in this break I thought we could do some poppy DDR music like some DDR poppy music starting it off with one of the most poppy songs of all Dark Knight wanted to dedicate this to his friend who's having a rough week so I'm gonna do that for him because we here at Orange Lounge Radio we care

384
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:21,718
[SPEAKER_28]: We care.

385
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:24,564
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

386
00:32:55,925 --> 00:32:57,086
[SPEAKER_28]: I made a My Bad there.

387
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:01,127
[SPEAKER_28]: That was actually for DJ Ranma S's friend, not Dark Knight's friend.

388
00:33:01,167 --> 00:33:03,167
[SPEAKER_28]: Although maybe Dark Knight wanted to hear it too, I have no idea.

389
00:33:03,267 --> 00:33:07,709
[SPEAKER_28]: But as you can tell, I usually get too many private messages during the show, so I screwed up.

390
00:33:07,809 --> 00:33:08,189
[SPEAKER_28]: My Bad!

391
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:15,851
My Bad

392
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:02,653
Thank you for watching

393
00:34:38,488 --> 00:34:43,170
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

394
00:35:13,012 --> 00:35:14,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

395
00:35:46,298 --> 00:35:47,820
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

396
00:37:11,008 --> 00:37:15,312
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

397
00:37:41,272 --> 00:37:57,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

398
00:38:03,251 --> 00:38:06,534
[SPEAKER_28]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 126.

399
00:38:09,008 --> 00:38:11,049
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I know, I can't believe we've been doing it that long either.

400
00:38:11,910 --> 00:38:20,775
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, we have been doing this quite a while, but there's always new stuff cooking up over at Orange Lounge Radio, and we have a brand new thing.

401
00:38:21,195 --> 00:38:27,938
[SPEAKER_28]: It just launched earlier this week, but we know a lot of you guys don't really pay attention to anything we do outside of this Sunday show, so we want to let you guys know.

402
00:38:28,479 --> 00:38:37,684
[SPEAKER_28]: There's actually a brand new show, and one of the most common requests we get here on Orange Lounge Radio is, can we download your show?

403
00:38:38,363 --> 00:38:40,344
[SPEAKER_28]: and to that we say, no, you can't.

404
00:38:40,644 --> 00:38:42,665
[SPEAKER_28]: The files are too big.

405
00:38:42,705 --> 00:38:43,865
[SPEAKER_09]: How does it feel to want?

406
00:38:44,786 --> 00:38:46,506
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically, A, the files are too big.

407
00:38:46,606 --> 00:38:49,668
[SPEAKER_28]: B, we want people to listen live and it hoards up our ratings.

408
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:52,329
[SPEAKER_28]: And C, you can always catch the rewinds on DDR-free radio Fridays at 6.

409
00:38:53,029 --> 00:38:53,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

410
00:38:53,449 --> 00:38:56,411
[SPEAKER_28]: So that is just not happening right now anyway.

411
00:38:56,451 --> 00:38:59,312
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't say it's never going to happen, but just right at this time it's not happening.

412
00:38:59,412 --> 00:39:04,214
[SPEAKER_28]: But we decided, we thought, well, let's give them something they can download.

413
00:39:04,234 --> 00:39:07,175
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's this new technology out there called podcasting.

414
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:07,959
[SPEAKER_28]: P.O.D.D.E.R.

415
00:39:28,464 --> 00:39:30,405
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have an iPod to hear this show?

416
00:39:30,845 --> 00:39:31,125
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

417
00:39:31,565 --> 00:39:36,287
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have a live 365 account or do you have to listen to the station live to hear this show?

418
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:36,727
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

419
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:39,148
[SPEAKER_28]: It's something you download onto your computer.

420
00:39:39,168 --> 00:39:40,669
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you have to have broadband to hear this show?

421
00:39:40,809 --> 00:39:40,969
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

422
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:42,370
[SPEAKER_28]: It's just going to be a little slower for you.

423
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:45,011
[SPEAKER_28]: So check out on our website.

424
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:46,952
[SPEAKER_28]: There's a new feature over on the left side.

425
00:39:47,032 --> 00:39:49,132
[SPEAKER_28]: It's called Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

426
00:39:49,653 --> 00:39:54,154
[SPEAKER_28]: And it's basically a brand new, I don't know, 15 to 25 minute show.

427
00:39:54,495 --> 00:39:55,155
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a mini show.

428
00:39:55,856 --> 00:39:58,861
[SPEAKER_28]: But it's something that's intended for you to download every week.

429
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:08,939
[SPEAKER_28]: And for those of you guys that do have some type of portable media player such as an iPod, the whole reason it's called podcasting is because iPod is the most popular form of this.

430
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:17,980
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you have any portable media player, really, what this is designed to do is that you can subscribe to the Orange Launch Radio podcast and then just keep checking it.

431
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:22,381
[SPEAKER_28]: Have your iPod or program check every week or so, or check every day.

432
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:26,402
[SPEAKER_28]: And every Monday or so, you're going to see a new show from us.

433
00:40:26,683 --> 00:40:32,444
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you have a media player, it'll hook right up to your media player so that you'll have a new show to listen to for that week.

434
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:33,365
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's pretty cool.

435
00:40:33,705 --> 00:40:34,705
[SPEAKER_28]: You've got to check it out.

436
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:37,226
[SPEAKER_28]: There's already an episode up there for grabs.

437
00:40:37,786 --> 00:40:41,848
[SPEAKER_28]: If you want to subscribe, I know a few of you guys have been having problems getting the most recent episode.

438
00:40:42,168 --> 00:40:45,210
[SPEAKER_28]: We're hoping that when we put up a new episode, it's going to fix all that.

439
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:46,671
[SPEAKER_28]: So just stay tuned.

440
00:40:47,451 --> 00:40:49,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Go ahead, subscribe to it, and keep checking.

441
00:40:49,752 --> 00:40:54,334
[SPEAKER_28]: There should be a new episode up tomorrow, if not late, late tonight, possibly.

442
00:40:55,135 --> 00:40:56,576
[SPEAKER_28]: But there is one already there.

443
00:40:56,636 --> 00:40:58,937
[SPEAKER_28]: We taped a show last week, and it got put up there.

444
00:40:59,893 --> 00:41:01,614
[SPEAKER_28]: and a lot of folks have already been downloading it.

445
00:41:01,674 --> 00:41:10,781
[SPEAKER_28]: In fact, I think we might have some new folks listening to this show who actually heard the podcast first because the podcast is such a huge new technology that's out there.

446
00:41:10,821 --> 00:41:13,443
[SPEAKER_28]: A lot of people are just downloading new shows as they can find it.

447
00:41:14,023 --> 00:41:17,165
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you came all this way to listen to our live show, hey, thanks a bunch.

448
00:41:17,826 --> 00:41:20,067
[SPEAKER_28]: Stop on in the chat room and let us know you enjoyed it.

449
00:41:20,888 --> 00:41:23,930
[SPEAKER_28]: www.OrangeLaunchRadio.com Click on chat.

450
00:41:25,043 --> 00:41:28,724
[SPEAKER_28]: And yes, it is a show we plan to do every week, if not more.

451
00:41:29,104 --> 00:41:37,826
[SPEAKER_28]: We might actually, I mean, when we go on the road, such as, oh, I don't know, E3, we might be able to use this technology to do updates every day.

452
00:41:37,906 --> 00:41:39,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Little shows, little interviews from E3.

453
00:41:39,826 --> 00:41:41,407
[SPEAKER_28]: So, stay tuned.

454
00:41:41,607 --> 00:41:41,987
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very cool.

455
00:41:42,007 --> 00:41:43,207
[SPEAKER_09]: I also have the Infernal Machine.

456
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:44,327
[SPEAKER_28]: Mm-hmm.

457
00:41:45,848 --> 00:41:46,988
[SPEAKER_28]: So, yeah, that...

458
00:41:49,417 --> 00:41:50,557
[SPEAKER_28]: So, wow.

459
00:41:51,298 --> 00:41:52,079
[SPEAKER_28]: Lots of stuff there.

460
00:41:52,119 --> 00:41:53,620
[SPEAKER_28]: The podcast is an exciting feature.

461
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,982
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember, all you've got to do is subscribe and you're set.

462
00:41:58,510 --> 00:42:11,100
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, of course, all the chat room is saying the next step is Orange Lounge Radio Television and I want my OLR TV, which is kind of funny because when you think about it, I don't know if you knew this, but do you know who one of the driving forces behind podcasting was?

463
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,942
[SPEAKER_28]: One of the people that kind of came up with the idea with some friends?

464
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:18,085
[SPEAKER_28]: Adam Curry, the MTV VJ from years ago.

465
00:42:18,366 --> 00:42:19,146
[SPEAKER_09]: Dude, he was cool.

466
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:20,187
[SPEAKER_28]: He was awesome.

467
00:42:20,307 --> 00:42:24,730
[SPEAKER_28]: And now he's got this thing, which just makes him even more cool.

468
00:42:24,831 --> 00:42:26,592
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know, it's awesome.

469
00:42:27,116 --> 00:42:31,798
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, it would be, like, ultimately cool if, like, it were also sponsored by Martha Quinn.

470
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:33,118
[SPEAKER_09]: Then I would be happy.

471
00:42:33,158 --> 00:42:35,059
[SPEAKER_09]: Because she has nice hair.

472
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:40,141
[SPEAKER_28]: Instead of being hosted by us, we'll just have Julie Brown and... You know what we need?

473
00:42:40,341 --> 00:42:40,562
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

474
00:42:40,802 --> 00:42:45,644
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to do something... When we have our TV show, we need, like, the remote control segment.

475
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:47,544
[SPEAKER_09]: Complete with those chairs.

476
00:42:47,985 --> 00:42:49,185
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously, remote control.

477
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:52,927
[SPEAKER_28]: That could be, like, our game show, the match game segment or something.

478
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:54,367
[SPEAKER_28]: If you get the answer wrong.

479
00:42:54,927 --> 00:42:56,108
[SPEAKER_28]: Nah, nah, nah, nah.

480
00:42:58,122 --> 00:42:59,423
[SPEAKER_28]: I remember when MTV was cool.

481
00:42:59,744 --> 00:43:01,145
[SPEAKER_09]: I know, now they suck on ice.

482
00:43:01,185 --> 00:43:04,848
[SPEAKER_28]: But the weird thing is, how old were we when MTV was cool?

483
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:07,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe 12, around that age?

484
00:43:07,511 --> 00:43:12,115
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the tale of when MTV was cool was when I was a senior in high school, so I was 18.

485
00:43:12,835 --> 00:43:17,399
[SPEAKER_28]: Was probably when these guys like Adam Curry and Martha Quinn and them were still on the air.

486
00:43:17,860 --> 00:43:19,061
[SPEAKER_28]: We're showing our age a little bit.

487
00:43:19,517 --> 00:43:20,117
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

488
00:43:40,502 --> 00:43:51,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Back when Mike Myers and Dana Carvey and all them were on... Now, some would argue with you that this old 75 cast with Bill Murray... Well, they were great too, but I mean as far as the more modern era of Saturday Night Live.

489
00:43:52,392 --> 00:43:55,295
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I would probably turn on 120 Minutes and Headbangers Ball.

490
00:43:56,716 --> 00:43:57,517
[SPEAKER_28]: My God, look at this!

491
00:43:58,012 --> 00:44:01,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Our chat room right now, you've got to see this over in OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on chat.

492
00:44:01,673 --> 00:44:07,094
[SPEAKER_28]: They're practically creating this whole treatment for an Orange Lounge Radio TV show that could be on MTV.

493
00:44:07,134 --> 00:44:13,336
[SPEAKER_28]: They're saying, oh, the cage match could have videos on it, people could vote, and it's crazy.

494
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:14,036
[SPEAKER_28]: That's awesome.

495
00:44:14,096 --> 00:44:14,756
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys rock.

496
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:16,577
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

497
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:17,637
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know what to tell you guys.

498
00:44:17,977 --> 00:44:24,839
[SPEAKER_28]: I'd love to see it happen someday, but at the same time, got to pay the rent, so I can't quit my J-Dub yet until somebody...

499
00:44:26,235 --> 00:44:27,516
[SPEAKER_28]: Here, Rob, here's some money.

500
00:44:27,936 --> 00:44:28,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Come do a show.

501
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:30,317
[SPEAKER_28]: Then I'd be all, fuck yeah, I quit.

502
00:44:31,037 --> 00:44:31,377
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

503
00:44:31,657 --> 00:44:35,458
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm sure you're the same, right?

504
00:44:36,098 --> 00:44:38,219
[SPEAKER_28]: Get paid to do Wayne's World?

505
00:44:38,679 --> 00:44:40,860
[SPEAKER_28]: Shut up.

506
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,782
[SPEAKER_28]: That's like my dream right there is Wayne's World, the movie.

507
00:44:45,802 --> 00:44:47,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Except don't they get kind of screwed in the end?

508
00:44:48,062 --> 00:44:48,322
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh well.

509
00:44:49,343 --> 00:44:49,763
[SPEAKER_28]: Who cares?

510
00:44:51,246 --> 00:45:02,963
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see, maybe someday But I think the podcast is a really exciting technology because it allows people like Adam Curry to hear us Anyway, we'll see what happens

511
00:45:04,241 --> 00:45:04,581
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

512
00:45:05,242 --> 00:45:07,063
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, so there's the podcast.

513
00:45:07,163 --> 00:45:11,007
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, I urge you guys to check this out on the website over at orangelaunchradio.com.

514
00:45:11,027 --> 00:45:11,867
[SPEAKER_28]: Just look in the upper left.

515
00:45:11,907 --> 00:45:13,308
[SPEAKER_28]: It says Orange Launch Radio to go.

516
00:45:13,829 --> 00:45:15,390
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really easy to set up.

517
00:45:15,490 --> 00:45:22,856
[SPEAKER_28]: Honestly, if you were able to listen to this show, if you were able to sign up for Live 365 and get this show to play, you can do this podcast thing.

518
00:45:22,916 --> 00:45:23,797
[SPEAKER_28]: It's super easy.

519
00:45:24,097 --> 00:45:25,899
[SPEAKER_28]: And again, you don't have to have a portable player.

520
00:45:26,199 --> 00:45:30,963
[SPEAKER_28]: You can just have it download the MP3 and you listen to it in Winamp or iTunes or whatever later.

521
00:45:31,423 --> 00:45:42,045
[SPEAKER_28]: And just an FYI, for those of you guys that do listen to this, that show is actually encoded in MP3 Pro, which doesn't do you any good if you have an iPod, because iPods don't decode it.

522
00:45:42,085 --> 00:45:45,905
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you're using Winamp, you can actually listen to that show in MP3 Pro, and it sounds great.

523
00:45:46,966 --> 00:45:47,706
[SPEAKER_28]: So, just a thought.

524
00:45:48,446 --> 00:45:48,706
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

525
00:45:49,566 --> 00:45:49,846
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

526
00:45:51,086 --> 00:45:52,387
[SPEAKER_28]: On to some actual gaming news.

527
00:45:52,427 --> 00:45:54,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's talk gaming news that's going on right now.

528
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:55,787
[SPEAKER_28]: Huge... No, this is huge.

529
00:45:55,827 --> 00:45:56,567
[SPEAKER_28]: This is really huge.

530
00:45:59,288 --> 00:45:59,588
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

531
00:46:00,328 --> 00:46:00,408
[SPEAKER_28]: In...

532
00:46:01,541 --> 00:46:03,783
[SPEAKER_28]: The DDR scene this week, there was huge news.

533
00:46:04,443 --> 00:46:10,007
[SPEAKER_28]: What has been one thing that people in the DDR scene have been begging for for the longest time?

534
00:46:10,888 --> 00:46:11,708
[SPEAKER_28]: Other than to get laid.

535
00:46:13,189 --> 00:46:14,910
[SPEAKER_24]: A 62 foot long cigar?

536
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:17,993
[SPEAKER_24]: No, not a 62 foot long cigar.

537
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:18,353
[SPEAKER_24]: What else?

538
00:46:22,335 --> 00:46:23,997
[SPEAKER_09]: They want more Mambo and Go-Go.

539
00:46:25,478 --> 00:46:30,281
[SPEAKER_24]: They want a DDR game featuring characters from other games that have nothing to do with DDR whatsoever.

540
00:46:31,257 --> 00:46:32,259
[SPEAKER_24]: That's absolutely right.

541
00:46:32,319 --> 00:46:34,943
[SPEAKER_28]: No, actually, I'll tell you, since you obviously don't know.

542
00:46:35,364 --> 00:46:37,909
[SPEAKER_28]: They want a DDR game on the GameCube.

543
00:46:38,850 --> 00:46:40,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Because GameCube doesn't have a DDR game.

544
00:46:40,253 --> 00:46:41,214
[SPEAKER_09]: There was one on the Nintendo 64.

545
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:42,697
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, not the GameCube.

546
00:46:44,446 --> 00:46:49,010
[SPEAKER_28]: So, GameCube announced this week is getting its own DDR game.

547
00:46:49,811 --> 00:46:54,896
[SPEAKER_24]: Does this fulfill my fantasy for having to buy yet another peripheral for another game system to play DDR?

548
00:46:55,076 --> 00:46:57,458
[SPEAKER_09]: You can never have too many specialty controllers, dammit.

549
00:46:57,558 --> 00:46:58,339
[SPEAKER_28]: It absolutely does.

550
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,742
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you think about it, Nintendo is really the granddaddy of DDR.

551
00:47:01,782 --> 00:47:03,464
[SPEAKER_28]: The granddaddy, granddaddy, granddaddy.

552
00:47:03,484 --> 00:47:06,206
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, the great, great granddaddy of DDR is Dance Aerobics.

553
00:47:07,307 --> 00:47:09,029
[SPEAKER_28]: If you think about it, with the power pad.

554
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:10,150
[SPEAKER_28]: So, um...

555
00:47:11,187 --> 00:47:15,670
[SPEAKER_28]: It makes sense that it's going back to its roots and DDR is going to be showing up on the GameCube.

556
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:18,231
[SPEAKER_28]: Details are very sketchy at this time.

557
00:47:18,331 --> 00:47:19,112
[SPEAKER_28]: This is what we know.

558
00:47:19,552 --> 00:47:22,434
[SPEAKER_28]: It's DDR featuring Mario.

559
00:47:24,455 --> 00:47:28,678
[SPEAKER_09]: We can urge to refer to old cartoon Rising.

560
00:47:29,318 --> 00:47:30,439
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know, seriously.

561
00:47:31,219 --> 00:47:33,421
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely the first thing I thought of when I heard this.

562
00:47:33,521 --> 00:47:38,404
[SPEAKER_28]: I read this story and it was very... Earlier this week the rain was keeping me up at like 4 in the morning.

563
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:56,816
[SPEAKER_28]: and I ended up getting online and I read about this and just instantly I couldn't help but when I read that DDR and Mario were teaming up to do this I couldn't help but think about this Hey Paisanos, it's the Super Mario Brothers Super Show

564
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,462
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you late 80s early 90s

565
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:53,892
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, you gotta love that echo at the end.

566
00:48:54,152 --> 00:48:56,274
[SPEAKER_23]: Hooked on the brothers, brothers, brothers.

567
00:48:57,295 --> 00:49:00,598
[SPEAKER_28]: I am petitioning Nintendo myself to have that song included.

568
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:02,420
[SPEAKER_28]: It needs to be there.

569
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:04,622
[SPEAKER_28]: It absolutely needs to be there in DDR Mario.

570
00:49:05,223 --> 00:49:07,145
[SPEAKER_28]: Or the one with Lou Albano singing it at the end.

571
00:49:07,385 --> 00:49:09,587
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's all do some Mario.

572
00:49:09,647 --> 00:49:10,188
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember that one?

573
00:49:10,928 --> 00:49:12,670
[SPEAKER_28]: I wish we had an MP3 of that we could play too, but...

574
00:49:13,832 --> 00:49:26,140
[SPEAKER_28]: So, here it is, Nintendo is going to be doing this DDR game, but Konami, it's some kind of partnership, and we don't really know in what capacity, if Nintendo is making the game with Konami's blessing, or what's going on.

575
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:35,807
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a feeling it's going to be very similar to Donkey Konga, because when you look at Donkey Konga, it's basically Taiko Drum Master, but with Donkey Konga.

576
00:49:36,787 --> 00:49:37,568
[SPEAKER_28]: Stupid clapping!

577
00:49:38,607 --> 00:49:40,148
[SPEAKER_28]: But it had Namco's blessing.

578
00:49:40,349 --> 00:49:42,070
[SPEAKER_28]: Namco actually helped him out with the game.

579
00:49:42,110 --> 00:49:43,872
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it's going to be very similar to that.

580
00:49:43,892 --> 00:49:44,792
[SPEAKER_28]: That's just speculation.

581
00:49:44,812 --> 00:49:45,133
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

582
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:45,513
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki?

583
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:47,615
[SPEAKER_24]: There's one thing for sure.

584
00:49:47,655 --> 00:49:48,936
[SPEAKER_24]: It's going to have awesome minigames.

585
00:49:48,956 --> 00:49:52,579
[SPEAKER_24]: Because if there's one thing that Nintendo's good at, it's making minigames for games.

586
00:49:53,760 --> 00:50:02,547
[SPEAKER_24]: So that would be a lot better than that crappy, what, feed the oddly shaped animal heads or whatever, you know?

587
00:50:03,168 --> 00:50:06,871
[SPEAKER_24]: Or the frustrating, hit the ball around the maze thing.

588
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:09,174
[SPEAKER_24]: That's a lot better than that.

589
00:50:13,564 --> 00:50:14,185
[SPEAKER_24]: I just can't.

590
00:50:14,465 --> 00:50:15,648
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I can't buy this game.

591
00:50:17,952 --> 00:50:19,593
[SPEAKER_28]: It's alright, because I'm definitely going to buy it.

592
00:50:19,633 --> 00:50:20,354
[SPEAKER_28]: I have to buy this game.

593
00:50:20,814 --> 00:50:26,359
[SPEAKER_28]: If you actually look at our website, orangelawnradio.com, we actually posted a story about this earlier this week.

594
00:50:26,419 --> 00:50:27,660
[SPEAKER_28]: It's like the second story down.

595
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:33,885
[SPEAKER_28]: It says, DDR teaming up with Mario, and if you actually click on the read more, you can see some screenshots from the game.

596
00:50:34,405 --> 00:50:40,550
[SPEAKER_28]: And the first two screenshots look like your standard DDR setup, although the two-player mode is interesting.

597
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:41,111
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like

598
00:50:42,074 --> 00:50:43,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Some of the dancing characters you can have.

599
00:50:43,654 --> 00:50:48,095
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a little Mario, and then it looks like a little... Either that's a Hammer Brother, or it's a Koopa Troopa.

600
00:50:48,115 --> 00:50:50,176
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't really tell, because it's from the Skyview.

601
00:50:50,196 --> 00:50:52,276
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's a Hammer Brother, because I see a hammer in the picture.

602
00:50:52,837 --> 00:50:56,577
[SPEAKER_28]: So it looks like those are some of the, maybe, dancing characters that might be available.

603
00:50:56,617 --> 00:50:56,978
[SPEAKER_28]: Who knows?

604
00:50:57,738 --> 00:51:04,119
[SPEAKER_28]: But then the third picture in there, it shows Mario running from snowballs, and there are no arrows on the screen.

605
00:51:04,539 --> 00:51:06,760
[SPEAKER_28]: So it makes you think that it's some kind of minigame.

606
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:11,561
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think it's definite that there's got to be a minigame that's going to turn up in here somewhere.

607
00:51:12,702 --> 00:51:17,265
[SPEAKER_24]: All it really is, is it comes down to... Look, Konami made a DDR pad.

608
00:51:17,466 --> 00:51:20,868
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, now we don't have to make another power pad, so let's make another power pad game.

609
00:51:21,929 --> 00:51:22,469
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it is.

610
00:51:24,991 --> 00:51:28,194
[SPEAKER_28]: I just... Nintendo, I think, is finally realizing they missed the boat on DDR.

611
00:51:28,214 --> 00:51:29,314
[SPEAKER_28]: They should have had this a long time ago.

612
00:51:29,695 --> 00:51:30,916
[SPEAKER_28]: And that Mad Catz game?

613
00:51:30,956 --> 00:51:31,536
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell was that?

614
00:51:31,676 --> 00:51:32,597
[SPEAKER_28]: MC Groove thing?

615
00:51:33,798 --> 00:51:34,038
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

616
00:51:34,904 --> 00:51:35,964
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

617
00:52:00,268 --> 00:52:08,434
[SPEAKER_28]: or you can play Parents Don't Understand for like five minutes because they don't cut their songs down and then the arrows don't make any sense at all and they come from the middle of the screen.

618
00:52:08,534 --> 00:52:09,194
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

619
00:52:09,915 --> 00:52:10,775
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, you can play In the Groove.

620
00:52:12,457 --> 00:52:16,379
[SPEAKER_28]: I would play In the Groove for three days straight before I would ever touch that other game.

621
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:17,900
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, Angel?

622
00:52:18,721 --> 00:52:19,481
[SPEAKER_28]: You look like you have a comment.

623
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:23,925
[SPEAKER_10]: I feel a little scared because you were just talking about the whole Mario thing and what shirt am I wearing?

624
00:52:24,145 --> 00:52:24,485
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops!

625
00:52:25,566 --> 00:52:26,046
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.

626
00:52:26,066 --> 00:52:26,626
[SPEAKER_28]: You're in the mood.

627
00:52:26,646 --> 00:52:27,427
[SPEAKER_28]: You're being festive.

628
00:52:28,528 --> 00:52:28,808
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

629
00:52:29,338 --> 00:52:31,060
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wearing my DDR Freak shirt.

630
00:52:31,160 --> 00:52:32,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

631
00:52:32,521 --> 00:52:32,902
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow.

632
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:36,085
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, if you two merged your shirts, you'd have this new game.

633
00:52:37,286 --> 00:52:39,889
[SPEAKER_10]: Very true, in a weird sort of way, yeah.

634
00:52:39,909 --> 00:52:40,290
[SPEAKER_10]: Scary.

635
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:44,234
[SPEAKER_28]: The working title of this game is Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

636
00:52:46,297 --> 00:52:47,939
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

00:53:06,956 --> 00:53:30,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Many games, it looks like it's going to come out summer of 2005 is when this game is scheduled to come out We're going to get the first peek at the game at the 2005 World Hobby Fair And that happens in Tokyo on January 16th So by this time next week, we ought to know some more details on this game So we'll definitely pass it along to you as soon as we know

[SPEAKER_28]: Any wishes you guys hope to see with this game?

[SPEAKER_28]: The Dance Dance Revolution with Mario game?

00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:41,601
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything on your wish list?

642
00:53:43,616 --> 00:53:47,537
[SPEAKER_09]: I want the swimming music to be in there.

643
00:53:50,698 --> 00:53:52,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't make me break out my cell phone.

644
00:53:52,999 --> 00:53:55,879
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how they would... No, you know what has to be in there?

645
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:56,640
[SPEAKER_09]: Speaking of cell phones.

646
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:57,500
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh-oh.

647
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:57,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

648
00:53:58,260 --> 00:53:58,980
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me get out my cell phone.

649
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:00,141
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

650
00:54:00,161 --> 00:54:03,621
[SPEAKER_28]: Meantime, while she's digging for that, Angel, wish list for this dance set?

651
00:54:03,661 --> 00:54:11,484
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to say a remix of the water music myself, but if we can't have that, then I guess the... What is it?

652
00:54:11,544 --> 00:54:12,264
[SPEAKER_10]: Level 2 music?

653
00:54:12,344 --> 00:54:12,524
[SPEAKER_10]: The...

654
00:54:13,044 --> 00:54:15,105
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, the blue level.

655
00:54:15,826 --> 00:54:16,526
[SPEAKER_10]: After the first one.

656
00:54:16,546 --> 00:54:17,227
[SPEAKER_28]: The blue level.

657
00:54:17,987 --> 00:54:18,688
[SPEAKER_10]: No, the... Here we go.

658
00:54:22,910 --> 00:54:23,210
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes!

659
00:54:24,011 --> 00:54:24,871
[SPEAKER_10]: Super Mario World!

660
00:54:25,031 --> 00:54:25,532
Yay!

661
00:54:27,353 --> 00:54:28,774
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you really dance to that?

662
00:54:29,254 --> 00:54:29,574
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

663
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:31,435
[SPEAKER_10]: In a really messed up sort of way?

664
00:54:31,475 --> 00:54:31,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure.

665
00:54:31,796 --> 00:54:33,196
[SPEAKER_10]: It'd be kind of hard.

666
00:54:36,699 --> 00:54:40,501
[SPEAKER_28]: I want the Campfire medley from Donkey Konga.

667
00:54:40,521 --> 00:54:41,161
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay.

668
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:44,171
[SPEAKER_09]: I love my phone.

669
00:54:44,911 --> 00:54:46,592
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a medley of all these campfire songs.

670
00:54:46,672 --> 00:54:47,872
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty good quality.

671
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:51,933
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, your wish list for Dance Dance Revolution with Mario?

672
00:54:53,814 --> 00:54:58,175
[SPEAKER_24]: That that be the only game they release on the GameCube for DDR.

673
00:54:59,895 --> 00:55:00,876
[SPEAKER_24]: Why you gotta hate?

674
00:55:00,976 --> 00:55:02,476
[SPEAKER_24]: Why you being such a hater with this?

675
00:55:02,536 --> 00:55:03,156
[SPEAKER_24]: I've gotta know.

676
00:55:04,557 --> 00:55:06,197
[SPEAKER_28]: It's gonna suck just like Donkey Konga.

677
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,525
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't think Donkey Konga sucked.

678
00:55:09,545 --> 00:55:10,546
[SPEAKER_28]: There could have been more to it.

679
00:55:10,566 --> 00:55:11,508
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we get the idea, Jimmy.

680
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:12,308
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously, we get it.

681
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:16,933
[SPEAKER_09]: I was wondering when you'd say something.

682
00:55:20,718 --> 00:55:24,502
[SPEAKER_28]: Donkey Konga, there could have been more to it, but it wasn't a bad game.

683
00:55:24,522 --> 00:55:26,624
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it was.

684
00:55:27,754 --> 00:55:28,174
[SPEAKER_28]: Whatever.

685
00:55:28,695 --> 00:55:29,035
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

686
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:38,700
[SPEAKER_28]: My wish list, I want to see Princess Peach as a dancing character, and whenever the stage is over, she'll go, Peach is the winner!

687
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:40,121
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like at Mario Party.

688
00:55:40,141 --> 00:55:41,282
[SPEAKER_09]: Hopefully they don't hooch her all up.

689
00:55:42,202 --> 00:55:49,947
[SPEAKER_28]: Dude, they should have Princess Peach in the Emmy costume that was shown at the Ultimix 2 demo at E3 when Emmy was all hoochified.

690
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,808
[SPEAKER_28]: They need that, but Princess Peach.

691
00:55:51,828 --> 00:55:52,508
[SPEAKER_28]: It would be awesome.

692
00:55:55,723 --> 00:55:57,484
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't wait to find out more information about this game.

693
00:55:57,904 --> 00:56:05,248
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually think this game has the potential to be very cool, because Nintendo, they've just got such classic songs, and it's going to be so cute.

694
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:10,531
[SPEAKER_28]: It's probably going to be geared for kids, and it'll probably end up being like OHA DDR, but I don't care.

695
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:13,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Or Disney's Rave, Disney's Mix, whatever you call it.

696
00:56:16,054 --> 00:56:19,336
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, we need more kiddie DDR.

697
00:56:19,716 --> 00:56:22,057
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to get them hooked young, like crack.

698
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:24,107
[SPEAKER_09]: Jungle Book or something?

699
00:56:53,017 --> 00:56:53,598
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, God.

700
00:56:53,658 --> 00:56:56,421
[SPEAKER_28]: The game that got me a dance pad for the first time.

701
00:56:56,441 --> 00:56:57,181
[SPEAKER_09]: You had that tiny thing.

702
00:56:57,242 --> 00:56:57,582
[SPEAKER_28]: I did.

703
00:56:57,722 --> 00:56:58,483
[SPEAKER_28]: It was... Okay.

704
00:56:59,013 --> 00:57:01,034
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had to bring you Third Mix to fix that.

705
00:57:01,114 --> 00:57:05,796
[SPEAKER_28]: This was, it was the very first US release of a dancing game.

706
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:08,257
[SPEAKER_28]: This was out before Dance Dance Revolution USA.

707
00:57:08,677 --> 00:57:10,738
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was the Jungle Book dance game.

708
00:57:10,778 --> 00:57:14,380
[SPEAKER_28]: It was put out by, I don't remember what the game, it was Jungle Groove.

709
00:57:14,540 --> 00:57:15,720
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I think it was called Jungle Groove.

710
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:20,762
[SPEAKER_28]: And it actually came with a little dance mat, but the dance mat was made for like a five year old.

711
00:57:21,163 --> 00:57:23,504
[SPEAKER_28]: But I bought it because I wanted a dance mat.

712
00:57:24,904 --> 00:57:27,645
[SPEAKER_28]: And it was this... I remember that Lou Bega was in it.

713
00:57:28,125 --> 00:57:33,007
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, like, he did a cover of that song that went, I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too.

714
00:57:33,147 --> 00:57:34,267
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember that song from the Jungle Book?

715
00:57:34,667 --> 00:57:37,368
[SPEAKER_28]: And that was, like, the big song you could unlock if you played it enough.

716
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:38,649
[SPEAKER_28]: What, Loki?

717
00:57:38,669 --> 00:57:41,189
[SPEAKER_28]: You're giving EDS, Evil's Death, stare over here.

718
00:57:42,710 --> 00:57:49,152
[SPEAKER_24]: Like I said before, this is why they do not need to make any more games for the GameCube that feature DDR.

719
00:57:49,352 --> 00:57:51,793
[SPEAKER_24]: Or, I know this was, like, for the Nintendo 64.

720
00:57:51,833 --> 00:57:52,613
[SPEAKER_24]: It still sucked.

721
00:57:53,106 --> 00:57:54,387
[SPEAKER_24]: Still, a Nintendo game sucked.

722
00:57:54,948 --> 00:57:56,490
[SPEAKER_28]: This game actually was PlayStation.

723
00:57:56,530 --> 00:57:57,911
[SPEAKER_28]: This was a PlayStation game that I bought.

724
00:57:58,171 --> 00:57:58,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Still sucked.

725
00:57:59,952 --> 00:58:04,196
[SPEAKER_28]: And I remember that this was right when I was starting to get into DDR.

726
00:58:04,496 --> 00:58:08,419
[SPEAKER_28]: And I finally remember that Jamie and some other folks all came to my apartment.

727
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,964
[SPEAKER_28]: And Jamie actually brought a little plug, a mod plug that would plug into the back of the PlayStation.

728
00:58:14,124 --> 00:58:14,965
[SPEAKER_09]: The game killer.

729
00:58:15,085 --> 00:58:15,745
[SPEAKER_28]: The game killer.

730
00:58:16,126 --> 00:58:19,749
[SPEAKER_28]: And then she brought a copy of Third Mix.

731
00:58:20,469 --> 00:58:25,634
[SPEAKER_28]: And we played DDR Third Mix on my little Jungle Book dance mat that's made for five-year-olds.

732
00:58:26,278 --> 00:58:30,599
[SPEAKER_28]: and I don't remember, I think it was LankyStyle was dancing to Graduizic Cyber.

733
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:34,560
[SPEAKER_28]: Funny stuff on that little five-year-old dance pad.

734
00:58:36,821 --> 00:58:37,221
[SPEAKER_28]: Memories.

735
00:58:38,961 --> 00:58:39,962
[SPEAKER_28]: Finally the damn thing broke.

736
00:58:39,982 --> 00:58:41,302
[SPEAKER_09]: That was a long-ass time ago.

737
00:58:41,402 --> 00:58:43,703
[SPEAKER_28]: The down arrow broke on that thing after like a week.

738
00:58:44,043 --> 00:58:44,943
[SPEAKER_09]: This was what?

739
00:58:46,029 --> 00:58:46,890
[SPEAKER_09]: 4 years ago.

740
00:58:46,910 --> 00:58:47,530
[SPEAKER_28]: 5 years ago.

741
00:59:08,423 --> 00:59:10,825
[SPEAKER_28]: and we found the Golf Land Machine December of 2000.

742
00:59:10,985 --> 00:59:12,466
[SPEAKER_28]: That's when we really started getting into it.

743
00:59:12,486 --> 00:59:13,127
[SPEAKER_09]: So it was early 2001 then.

744
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:13,547
[SPEAKER_09]: It was early 2001.

745
00:59:13,587 --> 00:59:14,648
[SPEAKER_09]: But it was in the winter time.

746
00:59:15,328 --> 00:59:24,435
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't even know we had machines in town until like September of 2000 when I would go play the 1.5.

747
00:59:26,276 --> 00:59:26,657
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yes.

748
00:59:27,037 --> 00:59:28,958
[SPEAKER_28]: And play Boom Boom Dollar over and over again.

749
00:59:30,299 --> 00:59:31,841
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you remember what the trick code was?

750
00:59:31,921 --> 00:59:32,861
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't even remember what it was.

751
00:59:33,502 --> 00:59:35,423
[SPEAKER_28]: It was like left, left, down, down, right, right or something.

752
00:59:35,463 --> 00:59:35,904
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

753
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:37,545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it was the running steps.

754
00:59:38,433 --> 00:59:39,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Was it left, down, right, down, left?

755
00:59:39,654 --> 00:59:40,714
[SPEAKER_09]: Left, down, right, down, left.

756
00:59:40,734 --> 00:59:43,635
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought there was, you had to hit one of them twice.

757
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:47,037
[SPEAKER_09]: It was, that was for Maniac.

758
00:59:48,217 --> 00:59:53,259
[SPEAKER_28]: Back in my day, you didn't get to just push the little button and be on Maniac steps.

759
00:59:53,279 --> 00:59:56,320
[SPEAKER_16]: You had to do the little... We didn't have Vivid.

760
00:59:56,941 --> 00:59:59,242
[SPEAKER_16]: We had, they were all one color and we liked it.

761
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:01,783
[SPEAKER_28]: And it wasn't called Heavy, it was called Maniac.

762
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:02,123
[SPEAKER_16]: Maniac.

763
01:00:02,683 --> 01:00:04,344
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you had to be one to play on it.

764
01:00:05,284 --> 01:00:07,505
[SPEAKER_09]: And we had one paranoia mix.

765
01:00:09,787 --> 01:00:10,327
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolutely.

766
01:00:10,767 --> 01:00:11,348
[SPEAKER_09]: So bad.

767
01:00:11,428 --> 01:00:12,068
[SPEAKER_28]: Preach on.

768
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:16,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Now I'm all in the mood for some nostalgic DDR music.

769
01:00:18,131 --> 01:00:19,111
[SPEAKER_28]: So I think we're going to take a break.

770
01:00:19,751 --> 01:00:24,053
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we come back from this break, more stuff, including tonight's cage match.

771
01:00:24,553 --> 01:00:28,035
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to do a list list tonight at some point, and who knows what else.

772
01:00:28,135 --> 01:00:29,716
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll be back after this.

773
01:00:30,556 --> 01:00:30,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

774
01:00:49,201 --> 01:00:52,584
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

775
01:01:16,246 --> 01:01:17,086

[SPEAKER_11]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

779
01:04:46,492 --> 01:04:46,794
Thank you.

780
01:06:15,225 --> 01:06:21,088
[SPEAKER_03]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because Real Radio makes Captain Jack cry.

781
01:06:25,470 --> 01:06:27,171
[SPEAKER_28]: You know the thing I realized about that promo?

782
01:06:27,231 --> 01:06:32,273
[SPEAKER_28]: What is Real Radio anymore these days, honestly, with all the... Everyone's on the Sirius Network.

783
01:06:32,293 --> 01:06:33,974
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe we should go on the Sirius Network.

784
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:34,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

785
01:06:34,595 --> 01:06:35,295
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

786
01:06:36,744 --> 01:06:38,746
[SPEAKER_09]: Man's still trying to bring us down.

787
01:07:02,316 --> 01:07:03,997
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

788
01:07:04,098 --> 01:07:08,321
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm having fun watching the chatroom there over at www.orangelonsradio.com.

789
01:07:08,341 --> 01:07:09,042
[SPEAKER_28]: Click on chat.

790
01:07:09,702 --> 01:07:14,906
[SPEAKER_28]: They're just talking about the DDR Mario game and just expectations.

791
01:07:14,926 --> 01:07:16,648
[SPEAKER_28]: Some people are already saying, it's going to suck.

792
01:07:17,088 --> 01:07:17,789
[SPEAKER_28]: Game's going to suck.

793
01:07:17,869 --> 01:07:18,529
[SPEAKER_28]: It's going to be horrible.

794
01:07:18,669 --> 01:07:19,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Worst game ever.

795
01:07:21,832 --> 01:07:22,552
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall see.

796
01:07:22,993 --> 01:07:23,793
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall soon see.

797
01:07:24,894 --> 01:07:30,739
[SPEAKER_28]: Somebody was talking about, then somehow the chat in the chatroom went on to playing DDR with a light gun.

798
01:07:32,512 --> 01:07:32,912
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura.com

799
01:07:52,278 --> 01:07:54,339
[SPEAKER_10]: The screw.

800
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:58,282
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, there's a screw.

801
01:07:58,502 --> 01:07:59,343
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right, that's key.

802
01:07:59,463 --> 01:07:59,843
[SPEAKER_10]: That's right.

803
01:08:00,444 --> 01:08:03,646
[SPEAKER_10]: But, yeah, that's what it reminded me of when you said light gun and DDR heroes.

804
01:08:03,666 --> 01:08:04,727
[SPEAKER_10]: No one going, no!

805
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:08,849
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, boy.

806
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:09,550
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

807
01:08:11,171 --> 01:08:14,413
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope this... You know, we don't know for sure if DDR Mario is even going to come to America.

808
01:08:16,015 --> 01:08:19,357
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so far, you know, all the writings in Japanese, so... But I would...

809
01:08:21,791 --> 01:08:24,912
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki says no plans, but I say it's gotta happen.

810
01:08:25,052 --> 01:08:26,993
[SPEAKER_28]: They would be idiots not to port this to the US.

811
01:08:27,013 --> 01:08:27,413
[SPEAKER_09]: Freeloader.

812
01:08:28,874 --> 01:08:29,514
[SPEAKER_28]: Not even that.

813
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:30,914
[SPEAKER_09]: All you need is Freeloader.

814
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:33,895
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, but I don't even... I want to play a US mix.

815
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:38,757
[SPEAKER_28]: Nintendo would be absolute morons to not bring this game to the US.

816
01:08:39,097 --> 01:08:40,018
[SPEAKER_28]: Absolute morons.

817
01:08:43,739 --> 01:08:44,159
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

818
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:46,860
[SPEAKER_24]: No, actually, no, they wouldn't.

819
01:08:46,900 --> 01:08:48,241
[SPEAKER_24]: Keep it far away from the States.

820
01:08:48,401 --> 01:08:49,181
[SPEAKER_24]: Far, far away.

821
01:08:50,017 --> 01:08:50,538
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't hate!

822
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:51,218
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't hate!

823
01:09:05,560 --> 01:09:06,541
[SPEAKER_24]: Thanks for watching!

824
01:09:21,571 --> 01:09:23,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, he does some really kick-ass sim files.

825
01:09:23,613 --> 01:09:35,021
[SPEAKER_24]: He's done one for Ecstasy, the 14 Hours Club mix, the Gravity, DarkSakura, Burn Nation mix, and Legend of Tak on there.

826
01:09:35,542 --> 01:09:41,206
[SPEAKER_24]: And he's also done some other cool songs, so go check those out on Bomani Style.

827
01:09:41,246 --> 01:09:48,972
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I'm nice, I might go and link them in the LiveJournal community for Orange Lounge Radio, which you can find on LiveJournal.com.

828
01:09:51,124 --> 01:09:53,025
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so glad you took the opportunity to whore that out.

829
01:09:53,085 --> 01:09:54,807
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, check out our LiveJournal community.

830
01:09:54,847 --> 01:09:55,767
[SPEAKER_28]: Just go to orangezontrade.com.

831
01:09:55,807 --> 01:09:57,548
[SPEAKER_09]: You're being immortalized in the sim file.

832
01:09:57,769 --> 01:09:58,109
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

833
01:09:58,129 --> 01:09:58,669
[SPEAKER_09]: That's rad.

834
01:09:58,729 --> 01:09:59,169
[SPEAKER_28]: That is pretty.

835
01:09:59,550 --> 01:10:01,871
[SPEAKER_28]: And one of them is your song.

836
01:10:01,911 --> 01:10:02,652
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I know.

837
01:10:02,712 --> 01:10:04,693
[SPEAKER_28]: And your name's on the background and everything.

838
01:10:04,893 --> 01:10:05,394
[SPEAKER_28]: It's pretty cool.

839
01:10:05,774 --> 01:10:07,295
[SPEAKER_09]: God damn, I feel important.

840
01:10:08,408 --> 01:10:16,969
[SPEAKER_24]: So yeah, that's pretty much all that's happened other than that DDRUK suffered a server crash.

841
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:25,351
[SPEAKER_24]: But they say that they're pretty much done with the Ultramix 2 sim files and they should be released in a week or so, I think.

842
01:10:25,391 --> 01:10:26,131
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I heard.

843
01:10:27,151 --> 01:10:32,452
[SPEAKER_24]: Because they're just finishing up the last bits of the beginner steps and that was pretty much all that was left.

844
01:10:32,812 --> 01:10:36,953
[SPEAKER_24]: So those should be coming out soon and DDR Maniacs is still down and

845
01:10:39,446 --> 01:10:40,487
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, I think that's pretty much it.

846
01:10:41,307 --> 01:10:43,629
[SPEAKER_24]: So, nothing really ain't going on.

847
01:10:44,129 --> 01:10:48,371
[SPEAKER_24]: Just a dead... Everyone's still kind of coming off the holiday.

848
01:10:50,753 --> 01:10:51,113
[SPEAKER_24]: So, yeah.

849
01:10:53,334 --> 01:10:53,615
[SPEAKER_24]: Angel?

850
01:10:55,176 --> 01:10:55,776
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can talk.

851
01:10:55,936 --> 01:10:56,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, my bad.

852
01:10:58,477 --> 01:11:12,441
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, actually, that new skin thing, the Technofiend skin, the third one, uh, Mikey and I, uh, BigRedPimp in the chat room, uh, we decided to try playing that online mode this week.

853
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:13,262
[SPEAKER_10]: That was pretty weird.

854
01:11:14,002 --> 01:11:15,282
[SPEAKER_10]: He kicked my butt twice.

855
01:11:15,382 --> 01:11:16,102
[SPEAKER_28]: How does that work?

856
01:11:16,162 --> 01:11:18,483
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't really, um, tried the online mode.

857
01:11:18,543 --> 01:11:21,244
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it... You have to, like... Is it laggy, or does it... No.

858
01:11:21,284 --> 01:11:21,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

859
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:21,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

860
01:11:22,102 --> 01:11:23,082
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's pretty good.

861
01:11:24,603 --> 01:11:30,086
[SPEAKER_10]: You have to put your own IP in it, and then you set up the server that way.

862
01:11:30,966 --> 01:11:35,849
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when people try to connect to it, they just put in your IP, and then it just works from there.

863
01:11:36,109 --> 01:11:36,709
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty cool.

864
01:11:37,469 --> 01:11:40,391
[SPEAKER_24]: There is a front end for all this, just so people know.

865
01:11:40,451 --> 01:11:40,911
[SPEAKER_24]: It's out there.

866
01:11:40,951 --> 01:11:45,313
[SPEAKER_24]: I can't remember the website, but there is a front end and an actual community base around it.

867
01:11:45,373 --> 01:11:47,494
[SPEAKER_24]: So if you search, you'll find it.

868
01:11:49,741 --> 01:11:50,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's in options.

869
01:11:50,701 --> 01:11:54,183
[SPEAKER_10]: Just go down to network and then, yeah.

870
01:11:54,223 --> 01:11:55,663
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty self-explanatory from there.

871
01:11:56,964 --> 01:11:57,304
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

872
01:11:59,205 --> 01:12:02,646
[SPEAKER_28]: If that's it for the sim news, then I think we're going to have ourselves a cage match.

873
01:12:02,686 --> 01:12:03,266
[SPEAKER_28]: How's that sound?

874
01:12:03,286 --> 01:12:04,167
[SPEAKER_23]: Cage match.

875
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:05,247
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, let's have a cage match.

876
01:12:08,160 --> 01:12:20,725
[SPEAKER_28]: Last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, Loki put in the most panned song ever in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match, getting a zero from every single person in the room, including himself.

877
01:12:22,106 --> 01:12:24,027
[SPEAKER_28]: Will he have his revenge this week?

878
01:12:24,187 --> 01:12:25,227
[SPEAKER_28]: We shall soon see.

879
01:12:26,928 --> 01:12:31,990
[SPEAKER_28]: The chatroom pick is now out because it got bumped out last week by Jamie's pick.

880
01:12:32,927 --> 01:12:42,818
[SPEAKER_28]: Which is a little song called Joe La Taxi And who knew that anybody liked anything French But our chat room apparently dug it It's like it's French as sung by a Japanese girl

881
01:12:43,174 --> 01:12:44,735
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, it's a cute song.

882
01:12:44,775 --> 01:12:45,556
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm kind of glad it won.

883
01:12:45,576 --> 01:12:46,156
[SPEAKER_28]: It was a cute one.

884
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:46,797
[SPEAKER_09]: I like it.

885
01:12:47,097 --> 01:12:51,480
[SPEAKER_28]: And since the chatroom choice is out, it may come back.

886
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,962
[SPEAKER_28]: That option may come back in a later week, but not tonight.

887
01:12:54,502 --> 01:12:57,385
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm coming back in with a choice of my own, and we shall see.

888
01:12:57,845 --> 01:13:12,576
[SPEAKER_28]: And I've decided just now, after seeing what all the songs are in Cage Match tonight, I've decided just now, I took a poll in the room about which song they wanted to see me put in Cage Match tonight, and I've decided to go against that and do what I feel like doing.

889
01:13:13,681 --> 01:13:19,092
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I took a poll, too, to see what song I should put in Cage Match, and you picked this one, so... Ah!

890
01:13:20,074 --> 01:13:20,515
[SPEAKER_24]: I laughed.

891
01:13:22,475 --> 01:13:23,255
[SPEAKER_28]: Very interesting.

892
01:13:23,335 --> 01:13:27,958
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's start off with a clip of last week's... Oh yes, a reminder on the way the cage match works.

893
01:13:28,438 --> 01:13:34,180
[SPEAKER_28]: It used to be songs that we think would be good in a DDR or other Bomani game, but now it's just kind of turned into whatever's cool.

894
01:13:34,621 --> 01:13:37,842
[SPEAKER_28]: Three songs, each host picks a song, puts it in the cage match.

895
01:13:38,362 --> 01:13:43,505
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys in the chat room, you have to be in the chat room to participate, www.orangehoundsradio.com, click on chat.

897
01:13:58,618 --> 01:13:59,338
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's have it.

898
01:13:59,739 --> 01:14:03,241
[SPEAKER_28]: First, you get a clip of last week's winner because you've already been hearing it all week long.

899
01:14:03,321 --> 01:14:03,821
[SPEAKER_28]: Here it is.

900
01:14:04,101 --> 01:14:05,822
[SPEAKER_28]: This is, and this is a long name.

901
01:14:05,862 --> 01:14:06,943
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm only going to say it once.

902
01:14:07,303 --> 01:14:11,985
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Aria Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

903
01:14:12,045 --> 01:14:12,866
[SPEAKER_28]: It's last week's winner.

01:14:13,246 --> 01:14:14,347
[SPEAKER_28]: Joe LaTaxi for short.

01:14:14,807 --> 01:14:15,047
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

01:15:48,954 --> 01:15:50,339
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

907
01:16:32,501 --> 01:16:33,782
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, that was song number one.

908
01:16:34,843 --> 01:16:37,825
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm only going to read this one more time because somebody missed the name.

909
01:16:38,165 --> 01:16:38,806
[SPEAKER_28]: Pay attention.

910
01:16:39,486 --> 01:16:44,269
[SPEAKER_28]: Aurea Posey with Joe LaTaxi, the Jan Wayne remix radio cut.

911
01:16:45,370 --> 01:16:45,871
[SPEAKER_26]: There you go.

912
01:16:46,411 --> 01:16:47,692
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's move into song number two.

913
01:16:47,812 --> 01:16:49,974
[SPEAKER_28]: Song number two is Loki's pick tonight.

914
01:16:51,515 --> 01:16:52,515
[SPEAKER_26]: What did you pick, Loki?

915
01:16:55,297 --> 01:17:00,081
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, everyone in the studio here voted for the wild card song and

916
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:01,414
[SPEAKER_24]: Guess what?

917
01:17:02,435 --> 01:17:11,122
[SPEAKER_24]: You see, last week I put in a song by a group called ProdigyRemix.com that's the Girls' Ideotech remix.

918
01:17:11,722 --> 01:17:14,885
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you didn't like that too much.

919
01:17:15,265 --> 01:17:15,866
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know what?

920
01:17:16,066 --> 01:17:17,146
[SPEAKER_24]: I said, fuck it.

921
01:17:17,587 --> 01:17:19,008
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't give a shit what you like.

922
01:17:19,548 --> 01:17:20,109
[SPEAKER_24]: So you know what?

923
01:17:20,269 --> 01:17:21,290
[SPEAKER_24]: I put in the original.

924
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:23,231
[SPEAKER_24]: So fucking, you get Girls again.

925
01:17:23,411 --> 01:17:27,394
[SPEAKER_24]: And if I can find a goddamn another remix of this song, I will put it in next week too.

926
01:17:28,275 --> 01:17:28,815
[SPEAKER_24]: So suck it.

927
01:17:28,915 --> 01:17:29,436
[SPEAKER_24]: Here's Girls.

928
01:17:34,887 --> 01:17:39,190
[SPEAKER_26]: Song number two, Prodigy with Girls and Joy.

929
01:19:59,108 --> 01:19:59,809
Thank you for watching!

930
01:21:25,383 --> 01:21:26,288
Thanks for watching!

931
01:21:59,493 --> 01:22:02,074
[SPEAKER_26]: Jamie, your thoughts?

932
01:22:03,815 --> 01:22:05,275
[SPEAKER_09]: I guess it didn't make it on the air.

933
01:22:05,556 --> 01:22:10,677
[SPEAKER_09]: So that last part, I'm like, if you'd like to take a phone call, please sign up and try it again.

934
01:22:10,997 --> 01:22:11,818
[SPEAKER_09]: Or deposit 25 cents.

935
01:22:11,918 --> 01:22:16,059
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually like that one a whole lot better.

936
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:19,381
[SPEAKER_09]: But it has some annoying parts, so it gets like a 6.

937
01:22:20,881 --> 01:22:21,261
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, 6.

938
01:22:21,421 --> 01:22:22,382
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not a 0.

939
01:22:22,942 --> 01:22:23,442
[SPEAKER_28]: 6 from Jamie.

940
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:24,342
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm actually surprised.

941
01:22:24,582 --> 01:22:25,103
[SPEAKER_28]: 6 from Jamie.

942
01:22:25,863 --> 01:22:26,163
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

943
01:22:26,183 --> 01:22:26,283
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

944
01:22:27,771 --> 01:22:29,352
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna be nice and give it a four.

945
01:22:29,412 --> 01:22:31,674
[SPEAKER_10]: It wasn't as bad as last week, so whatever.

946
01:22:32,815 --> 01:22:33,335
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, I know.

947
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:33,976
[SPEAKER_23]: Shit.

948
01:22:34,276 --> 01:22:38,099
[SPEAKER_23]: Angel gives everything like a nine or a ten, and she gave that a four.

949
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:39,259
[SPEAKER_23]: That's not nice.

950
01:22:40,740 --> 01:22:41,941
[SPEAKER_10]: It's better than zero.

951
01:22:41,961 --> 01:22:43,002
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, you got a point.

952
01:22:43,082 --> 01:22:43,723
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Loki.

953
01:22:45,124 --> 01:22:46,865
[SPEAKER_24]: It gets a girls, because...

954
01:22:47,529 --> 01:23:16,026
[SPEAKER_24]: I want everyone every time they hear the word girls to think of this song and it will be foreverly imprinted on your brain you'll never be able to forget the song no matter how bad it sucks it will just stick with you like the goddamn ketchup song and milkshake song it's just gonna it's just everybody's gonna hear girls and just think of that so it's gonna be brainwashed into your head anyways I give it a hundred because it's awesome

955
01:23:16,770 --> 01:23:19,132
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

956
01:23:36,562 --> 01:23:51,135
[SPEAKER_28]: and you put it in a nice shoebox and you put that shoebox in nice wrapping and then you paint it with glitter and then you tie it up in a nice little bow and then you put a little ribbon on it and it's a little sparkling and then you put, you know, you plate it in gold and then you cover it in money.

957
01:23:51,676 --> 01:23:54,318
[SPEAKER_28]: You still have dog shit!

958
01:23:56,720 --> 01:23:58,802
[SPEAKER_28]: But it wasn't as bad as last week so I give it a one.

959
01:23:59,543 --> 01:24:00,924
[SPEAKER_09]: That's more like a dog fart.

960
01:24:01,985 --> 01:24:02,365
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

961
01:24:05,131 --> 01:24:05,591
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

962
01:24:23,326 --> 01:24:24,566
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to go with this one.

963
01:24:25,107 --> 01:24:28,628
[SPEAKER_28]: I cannot let Prodigy win, so I've got to bring out the big guns.

964
01:24:29,248 --> 01:24:31,288
[SPEAKER_28]: And I truly think this is the better song.

965
01:24:31,348 --> 01:24:33,209
[SPEAKER_28]: It's one I've been listening to in my car all week.

966
01:24:33,629 --> 01:24:36,730
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a group called Flower Power is the name of the group.

967
01:24:37,230 --> 01:24:38,891
[SPEAKER_28]: And they have a guest singer on this one.

968
01:24:39,391 --> 01:24:40,151
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Danny Minow.

969
01:24:40,911 --> 01:24:41,372
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

970
01:24:41,632 --> 01:24:41,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

971
01:24:42,732 --> 01:24:42,892
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

972
01:24:43,254 --> 01:24:45,095
[SPEAKER_10]: Again, another Mario reference.

973
01:24:45,175 --> 01:24:46,096
[SPEAKER_10]: Please kill me.

974
01:24:46,516 --> 01:24:47,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

975
01:24:47,476 --> 01:24:48,697
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Danny Minow.

976
01:24:48,837 --> 01:24:52,999
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, it's Flower Power featuring Danny Minow with a song called You Won't Forget About Me.

977
01:24:53,279 --> 01:24:53,559
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

978
01:25:38,728 --> 01:25:48,683
I'm breathing in deep, let it go, now I don't know It's good to know, yeah it's good to know that you

01:27:29,251 --> 01:27:31,113
Thanks for watching!

981
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:41,347
[SPEAKER_28]: Oops.

982
01:28:42,668 --> 01:28:44,188
[SPEAKER_28]: You got a little bit of my next song in there.

983
01:28:45,469 --> 01:28:46,249
[SPEAKER_28]: That's for next week.

984
01:28:46,309 --> 01:28:46,809
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

985
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:51,391
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, that was Danny Minow with You Won't Forget About Me.

986
01:28:52,051 --> 01:28:56,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see if we won't be able to forget that song or if we'd rather would forget it.

987
01:28:56,473 --> 01:28:56,753
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie.

988
01:28:57,453 --> 01:28:58,133
[SPEAKER_09]: It wasn't bad.

989
01:28:58,193 --> 01:28:58,734
[SPEAKER_09]: It didn't suck.

990
01:28:58,774 --> 01:28:59,314
[SPEAKER_09]: It gets an eight.

991
01:29:00,294 --> 01:29:00,614
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel.

992
01:29:02,855 --> 01:29:03,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

993
01:29:04,156 --> 01:29:04,736
[SPEAKER_10]: It's Danny.

994
01:29:05,196 --> 01:29:06,836
[SPEAKER_10]: Nine.

995
01:29:07,717 --> 01:29:07,997
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki.

996
01:29:10,017 --> 01:29:11,218
[SPEAKER_24]: I forgot about the song.

997
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:13,200
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry, Danny Minow sucks.

998
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:16,022
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just a fucking clone of Kylie Minow.

999
01:29:16,242 --> 01:29:17,083
[SPEAKER_24]: So, you know what?

1000
01:29:17,904 --> 01:29:18,364
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't like it.

1001
01:29:18,905 --> 01:29:19,225
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm sorry.

1002
01:29:19,365 --> 01:29:19,845
[SPEAKER_24]: It's a four.

1003
01:29:22,828 --> 01:29:24,710
[SPEAKER_28]: I like that song because it's very disco.

1004
01:29:25,010 --> 01:29:26,451
[SPEAKER_28]: And it has a very catchy hook.

1005
01:29:26,491 --> 01:29:29,354
[SPEAKER_28]: And I don't care if you didn't like it tonight, which most of you in the chatroom didn't.

1006
01:29:30,034 --> 01:29:31,716
[SPEAKER_28]: You won't be able to forget that song come tomorrow.

1007
01:29:31,736 --> 01:29:32,897
[SPEAKER_28]: You'll be thinking about that hook.

1008
01:29:34,018 --> 01:29:35,239
[SPEAKER_28]: I promise you this.

1009
01:29:35,739 --> 01:29:36,440
[SPEAKER_28]: I promise you...

1010
01:29:39,110 --> 01:29:40,971
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see, we'll see what they remember come tomorrow.

1011
01:29:41,452 --> 01:29:43,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright guys, it's time to vote.

1012
01:29:45,314 --> 01:29:51,779
[SPEAKER_28]: But after this quick recap of the songs you can vote for tonight, song number one, Joe LaTaxi.

1013
01:30:02,727 --> 01:30:05,289
[SPEAKER_28]: Song number two, Prodigy with Girls.

1014
01:30:13,780 --> 01:30:20,125
[SPEAKER_28]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Flower Power featuring Danny Minow, You Won't Forget About Me.

1015
01:30:29,431 --> 01:30:32,474
[SPEAKER_28]: Place, vote, now.

1016
01:30:32,614 --> 01:30:41,160
[SPEAKER_28]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for either song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1017
01:30:42,566 --> 01:30:43,408
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't vote for song number two.

1018
01:30:55,450 --> 01:30:59,951
[SPEAKER_24]: and if this doesn't win, I have more girls to go in for next week.

1019
01:31:00,731 --> 01:31:03,392
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, we need to institute some new rule against that.

1020
01:31:04,512 --> 01:31:09,473
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, help me come up with a rule so Loki cannot put in another remix of Girls next week if he loses.

1021
01:31:10,534 --> 01:31:12,254
[SPEAKER_09]: The other veto power.

1022
01:31:12,974 --> 01:31:13,635
[SPEAKER_28]: The veto power?

1023
01:31:13,655 --> 01:31:14,255
[SPEAKER_09]: The veto power.

1024
01:31:14,335 --> 01:31:17,615
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, veto power's in.

1025
01:31:18,356 --> 01:31:19,156
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's take a vote.

1026
01:31:19,216 --> 01:31:20,976
[SPEAKER_28]: Who votes that we do the veto power next week?

1027
01:31:21,837 --> 01:31:23,597
[SPEAKER_28]: And who votes we don't do the veto power next week?

1028
01:31:24,244 --> 01:31:24,985
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh shit!

1029
01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:27,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Sucks to be you.

1030
01:31:29,388 --> 01:31:33,251
[SPEAKER_09]: Although I actually kind of liked the original.

1031
01:31:34,192 --> 01:31:37,815
[SPEAKER_28]: To Loki's credit, the original wasn't as bad as the one last week.

1032
01:31:38,055 --> 01:31:38,896
[SPEAKER_28]: But it was still pretty bad.

1033
01:31:40,231 --> 01:31:40,491
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1034
01:31:41,052 --> 01:31:44,454
[SPEAKER_28]: I just... We've got to encourage Loki to expand his horizons.

1035
01:31:44,834 --> 01:31:47,196
[SPEAKER_28]: But then he's just going to go and put echo image in or something.

1036
01:31:49,158 --> 01:31:49,558
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1037
01:31:50,879 --> 01:31:52,340
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what... Oh, and look at the chat room.

1038
01:31:52,360 --> 01:31:53,941
[SPEAKER_28]: They're all raising their hands as well.

1039
01:31:54,301 --> 01:31:55,022
[SPEAKER_28]: Too bad they don't get a vote.

1040
01:31:55,402 --> 01:31:55,722
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1041
01:31:57,304 --> 01:31:58,104
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what happens.

1042
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:58,484
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1043
01:31:59,205 --> 01:31:59,825
[SPEAKER_24]: They get a vote?

1044
01:32:00,866 --> 01:32:01,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, they get their vote right now.

1045
01:32:02,047 --> 01:32:03,588
[SPEAKER_28]: They're voting for their favorite song.

1046
01:32:03,688 --> 01:32:06,971
[SPEAKER_28]: Either Joe LaTaxi or Girls or Danny.

1047
01:32:07,031 --> 01:32:07,451
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1048
01:32:08,332 --> 01:32:08,632
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1049
01:32:09,463 --> 01:32:13,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Moving on, what else is going on in the gaming world right now?

1050
01:32:13,365 --> 01:32:15,886
[SPEAKER_28]: You talked about that you'd actually played some Bomani this week, Jamie?

1051
01:32:16,586 --> 01:32:17,526
[SPEAKER_28]: Just 2DX.

1052
01:32:18,107 --> 01:32:20,148
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I thought you'd actually gone out to the arcade or something.

1053
01:32:20,888 --> 01:32:21,108
[SPEAKER_09]: No.

1054
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:23,749
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't had time.

1055
01:32:24,209 --> 01:32:29,211
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, I want to go out to the arcade, but I can't get my motivation.

1056
01:32:29,571 --> 01:32:32,213
[SPEAKER_09]: I've actually been tempted to re-download BM98.

1057
01:32:32,993 --> 01:32:33,413
[SPEAKER_28]: Why's that?

1058
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:34,654
[SPEAKER_09]: Just because I miss it.

1059
01:32:34,794 --> 01:32:35,494
[SPEAKER_09]: It feels fun.

1060
01:32:36,912 --> 01:32:38,212
[SPEAKER_28]: What was so great about it?

1061
01:32:38,232 --> 01:32:42,813
[SPEAKER_09]: Just the fact that you could... It was the Metal Gear song, but it had the whole first level of Metal Gear.

1062
01:32:45,574 --> 01:32:45,894
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1063
01:32:49,535 --> 01:32:52,036
[SPEAKER_28]: I need to go out to the arcade sometime this week and play some DDR.

1064
01:32:52,056 --> 01:32:53,636
[SPEAKER_28]: We should have like a DDR night or something.

1065
01:32:54,996 --> 01:32:55,816
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, I know.

1066
01:32:57,437 --> 01:32:57,977
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well...

1067
01:32:58,991 --> 01:33:00,912
[SPEAKER_28]: G, I guess we're going to take a break.

1068
01:33:00,992 --> 01:33:03,894
[SPEAKER_28]: And when we come back from the break, we'll find out who won Cage Match.

1069
01:33:04,214 --> 01:33:07,276
[SPEAKER_28]: And we will have ourselves a list list for this evening.

1070
01:33:07,356 --> 01:33:08,396
[SPEAKER_28]: So be thinking about that.

1071
01:33:10,317 --> 01:33:10,537
[SPEAKER_13]: Rob.

1072
01:33:10,717 --> 01:33:10,898
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1073
01:33:11,098 --> 01:33:11,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

1074
01:33:11,378 --> 01:33:11,538
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1075
01:33:11,838 --> 01:33:11,998
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1076
01:33:12,098 --> 01:33:12,238
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

1077
01:33:12,278 --> 01:33:12,418
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1078
01:33:12,438 --> 01:33:12,578
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob.

1079
01:33:12,638 --> 01:33:12,739
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi.

1080
01:33:12,759 --> 01:33:12,939
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1081
01:33:12,999 --> 01:33:13,459
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

1082
01:33:23,877 --> 01:33:26,958
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take a break when we come back to tonight's version of Listless.

1083
01:33:27,418 --> 01:33:39,660
[SPEAKER_28]: And if you guys would like to start making suggestions for tonight's Listless, tonight's Listless topic is video game we would most like to see in 2005.

1084
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:45,181
[SPEAKER_28]: Now that doesn't mean it has to actually be a game that has been announced, although it could be.

1085
01:33:45,761 --> 01:33:46,661
[SPEAKER_28]: You could make something up.

1086
01:33:46,961 --> 01:33:51,002
[SPEAKER_28]: But just video game I most want to see so I can buy it in 2005.

1087
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:51,902
[SPEAKER_28]: That's tonight's topic.

1088
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:59,708
[SPEAKER_28]: When we come back from this break of music featuring songs from DDR Solo, because I just want an excuse to play Temple of Love.

1089
01:34:01,310 --> 01:34:03,393
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll be back after this.

1090
01:34:04,054 --> 01:34:04,375
[SPEAKER_28]: Enjoy.

1091
01:34:06,237 --> 01:34:07,679
[SPEAKER_28]: And don't forget, vote on tonight's cage match.

1092
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:28,859
[SPEAKER_19]: You hear the priest that's trying to keep his god asleep Love's shining eternally, love will make you feel so free Come on girl, it's okay for satisfaction You must break the flame of passion In the blood that's shining in the temple of love

1093
01:34:58,300 --> 01:34:59,181
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

1094
01:36:03,479 --> 01:36:04,220
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for watching!

1095
01:37:18,367 --> 01:37:22,482
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's dream a dream together A dream that is real

1096
01:39:29,223 --> 01:39:29,944
[SPEAKER_17]: I wanna rock!

1097
01:40:08,570 --> 01:40:09,531
[SPEAKER_27]: Gaming Radio.

1098
01:40:09,751 --> 01:40:17,055
[SPEAKER_27]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1099
01:40:17,215 --> 01:40:18,555
[SPEAKER_27]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1100
01:40:23,758 --> 01:40:25,739
[SPEAKER_28]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1101
01:40:28,161 --> 01:40:29,061
[SPEAKER_28]: Tom Brokaw, our buddy.

1102
01:40:29,882 --> 01:40:31,082
[SPEAKER_28]: We miss him already, don't we?

1103
01:40:31,122 --> 01:40:32,443
[SPEAKER_28]: That other guy is not quite as cool.

1104
01:40:32,963 --> 01:40:33,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1105
01:40:33,604 --> 01:40:36,025
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, you guys ready to hear who won tonight's cage match?

1106
01:40:36,045 --> 01:40:37,726
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

1107
01:40:37,746 --> 01:40:37,926
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1108
01:40:37,946 --> 01:40:38,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

1109
01:40:38,424 --> 01:40:41,746
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll tell you what guys, it was a landslide vote.

1110
01:40:42,387 --> 01:40:48,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Every song got a couple of votes, but tonight's winner was an absolute landslide.

1111
01:40:48,190 --> 01:40:51,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Getting twice as many votes as the other two songs combined.

1112
01:40:52,413 --> 01:40:53,694
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think?

1113
01:40:53,934 --> 01:40:55,395
[SPEAKER_28]: All that being said, who do you think won it?

1114
01:40:57,436 --> 01:40:58,377
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki says my song.

1115
01:40:58,397 --> 01:40:59,037
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think, Jamie?

1116
01:40:59,577 --> 01:41:00,238
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I don't care.

1117
01:41:00,598 --> 01:41:01,138
[SPEAKER_28]: I think you don't care.

1118
01:41:01,158 --> 01:41:01,759
[SPEAKER_28]: What do you think, Loki?

1119
01:41:02,639 --> 01:41:03,700
[SPEAKER_09]: I already told you I thought.

1120
01:41:03,820 --> 01:41:04,440
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh yeah, just kidding.

1121
01:41:04,540 --> 01:41:05,201
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, what do you think?

1122
01:41:07,226 --> 01:41:08,406
[SPEAKER_28]: I already know, so I can't say.

1123
01:41:10,108 --> 01:41:13,350
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess I'll say... Oh, God.

1124
01:41:13,750 --> 01:41:16,252
[SPEAKER_10]: It's either a toss-up between Jamie's or yours.

1125
01:41:16,593 --> 01:41:17,433
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, let's see.

1126
01:41:17,533 --> 01:41:21,816
[SPEAKER_28]: Tonight's cage match winner is... Dome of Taxi!

1127
01:41:21,917 --> 01:41:23,218
[SPEAKER_28]: Holy shit!

1128
01:41:23,398 --> 01:41:23,858
[SPEAKER_28]: Cool!

1129
01:41:25,439 --> 01:41:27,160
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually kind of thought it would be yours.

1130
01:41:27,461 --> 01:41:29,983
[SPEAKER_28]: Blew the other two songs out of the freaking water.

1131
01:41:31,784 --> 01:41:33,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Got two more where that came from, baby.

1132
01:41:33,584 --> 01:41:34,786
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, thank you, chat room.

1133
01:41:34,806 --> 01:41:35,627
[SPEAKER_09]: You really love me.

1134
01:41:36,027 --> 01:41:36,989
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1135
01:41:37,389 --> 01:41:41,374
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I'm not so sure if it's that they love you as they hated the other two songs.

1136
01:41:41,394 --> 01:41:42,836
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I know your song was kind of cool.

1137
01:41:42,916 --> 01:41:43,517
[SPEAKER_09]: I liked it.

1138
01:41:43,637 --> 01:41:43,958
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1139
01:41:45,219 --> 01:41:47,783
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, so Jolitaxi wins it two weeks in a row.

1140
01:41:49,048 --> 01:41:49,408
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1141
01:41:50,029 --> 01:41:51,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki's going to keep trying, though.

1142
01:41:51,290 --> 01:41:54,152
[SPEAKER_28]: He wants to put girls up again next week, so we'll see what happens.

1143
01:41:54,612 --> 01:41:56,333
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm going to tell you, you're going to keep losing, too.

1144
01:41:57,254 --> 01:41:59,435
[SPEAKER_09]: Yet another week I don't have to pick a song.

1145
01:41:59,615 --> 01:42:00,596
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everybody.

1146
01:42:01,717 --> 01:42:06,560
[SPEAKER_28]: We haven't had a two-week winner since, well, Gwen Stefani wasn't that long ago, I suppose.

1147
01:42:07,180 --> 01:42:08,661
[SPEAKER_28]: That was the last song we had to retire.

1148
01:42:10,390 --> 01:42:10,890
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, alright.

1149
01:42:11,531 --> 01:42:14,272
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's get into tonight's list list.

1150
01:42:14,352 --> 01:42:28,300
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, let's explain the way list list works, because I know a lot of you guys are new to Orange Lounge Radio, whether it be through the DDR Freak repeats, which are on Friday nights at 6 o'clock, if you ever miss this show, by the way, on DDR Freak Radio, or through the podcast.

1151
01:42:28,700 --> 01:42:30,981
[SPEAKER_28]: So it's very possible you haven't heard list list before.

1152
01:42:31,041 --> 01:42:31,862
[SPEAKER_28]: Basically what we do...

1153
01:42:32,617 --> 01:42:34,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you for watching!

1154
01:42:51,678 --> 01:42:57,759
[SPEAKER_28]: So tonight's list is going to be video game you most want to see in 2005.

1155
01:42:58,099 --> 01:43:00,079
[SPEAKER_28]: And this can be something that's already been announced.

1156
01:43:00,620 --> 01:43:04,960
[SPEAKER_28]: This could be something that you just dream about.

1157
01:43:05,660 --> 01:43:06,901
[SPEAKER_28]: It could be just about anything.

1158
01:43:06,921 --> 01:43:08,541
[SPEAKER_28]: We're really not setting any limits on this.

1159
01:43:08,601 --> 01:43:10,241
[SPEAKER_28]: So let's see what everybody comes up with.

1160
01:43:11,041 --> 01:43:16,042
[SPEAKER_28]: But in order to do list list properly, we have to bring in our game show announcer and our game show music.

1161
01:43:16,082 --> 01:43:17,382
[SPEAKER_28]: So you guys ready to do some list list?

1162
01:43:17,802 --> 01:43:18,022
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1163
01:43:18,323 --> 01:43:18,663
[SPEAKER_28]: Sure.

1164
01:43:19,123 --> 01:43:19,603
[SPEAKER_28]: What was that?

1165
01:43:19,743 --> 01:43:20,143
[SPEAKER_28]: Nothing.

1166
01:43:20,583 --> 01:43:21,103
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, here we go.

1167
01:43:21,670 --> 01:43:23,211
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's bring in our game show announcer.

1168
01:43:42,825 --> 01:43:44,266
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right, everybody.

1169
01:43:44,806 --> 01:43:47,348
[SPEAKER_23]: It's time to play Listless.

1170
01:43:48,129 --> 01:43:53,212
[SPEAKER_23]: Remember, in order to participate in the listless segment, you have to be in our chat room!

[SPEAKER_23]: Did you ever get this shoe removed from your butt?

1183
01:44:40,914 --> 01:44:43,136
[SPEAKER_23]: I have no idea what you're talking about!

1184
01:45:05,788 --> 01:45:06,808
[SPEAKER_28]: Why the hell not?

1185
01:45:06,848 --> 01:45:08,989
[SPEAKER_28]: You always start off these segments, so why not?

1186
01:45:09,049 --> 01:45:09,709
[SPEAKER_28]: Why the hell not?

1187
01:45:09,749 --> 01:45:11,710
[SPEAKER_28]: You're number three pick.

1188
01:45:12,370 --> 01:45:13,691
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp My Ride the game.

1189
01:45:14,931 --> 01:45:23,894
[SPEAKER_09]: After all, you know, and all of those racing games they have where you can customize your car and everything, they just need a game of nothing but that, because that's the most fun.

1190
01:45:24,954 --> 01:45:26,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp My Ride the game.

1191
01:45:26,335 --> 01:45:27,895
[SPEAKER_28]: Pimp My Ride the game.

1192
01:45:27,955 --> 01:45:28,916
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty creative.

1193
01:45:28,936 --> 01:45:29,716
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to give that to you.

1194
01:45:29,736 --> 01:45:30,216
[SPEAKER_28]: That's good.

1195
01:45:30,716 --> 01:45:31,096
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1196
01:45:31,656 --> 01:45:33,077
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, you're number three pick.

1197
01:45:35,492 --> 01:45:37,933
[SPEAKER_24]: This one just came to me now, just like an epiphany.

1198
01:45:39,433 --> 01:45:49,657
[SPEAKER_24]: This one is going to have similar gameplay to Katamari Damacy.

1199
01:45:51,237 --> 01:45:56,819
[SPEAKER_24]: I think it would be very popular because everybody has these, they can identify with them.

1200
01:45:57,739 --> 01:46:00,480
[SPEAKER_24]: It's Roll My SUV The Game.

1201
01:46:04,704 --> 01:46:06,866
[SPEAKER_24]: Because, you know, those SUVs, they like to roll.

1202
01:46:08,727 --> 01:46:10,889
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't get it or something.

1203
01:46:10,909 --> 01:46:14,552
[SPEAKER_28]: Can you explain the joke, please, for the mentally challenged such as myself?

1204
01:46:15,673 --> 01:46:26,643
[SPEAKER_24]: Giant fucking vehicles that have no point in being on a road, and people drive them around like they're race cars, and well, since they have a high center of balance, they tend to roll.

1205
01:46:27,424 --> 01:46:31,467
[SPEAKER_24]: Like, as in flip over, as in crash, explode, people die.

1206
01:46:31,687 --> 01:46:32,288
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds like Burnout 3.

1207
01:46:33,902 --> 01:46:34,682
[SPEAKER_24]: Sounds like Driver 3.

1208
01:46:35,643 --> 01:46:37,923
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your number three pick, please.

1209
01:46:38,083 --> 01:46:47,806
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to say Actraiser DS just because I was being serious, but I think I need to steal K-Dash's suggestion, which was DDR Dimash.

1210
01:46:49,487 --> 01:46:50,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it sounded funny.

1211
01:46:51,447 --> 01:46:53,928
[SPEAKER_28]: And how exactly does DDR Dimash work?

1212
01:46:55,029 --> 01:46:57,509
[SPEAKER_10]: I have no idea, but it sounded funny at the time.

1213
01:46:57,629 --> 01:46:58,230
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know what?

1214
01:46:58,270 --> 01:46:59,550
[SPEAKER_10]: He gets a cookie for that one.

1215
01:47:01,084 --> 01:47:01,964
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, fair enough.

1216
01:47:02,524 --> 01:47:06,286
[SPEAKER_28]: My number three pick, I actually went with a serious one, heaven forbid.

1217
01:47:06,846 --> 01:47:09,646
[SPEAKER_28]: This is a game that has needed to come out for about the past ten years.

1218
01:47:10,527 --> 01:47:11,227
[SPEAKER_28]: Kid Icarus 2005.

1219
01:47:11,447 --> 01:47:13,348
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy shit, yeah.

1220
01:47:17,149 --> 01:47:19,489
[SPEAKER_28]: I seriously, seriously don't get it.

1221
01:47:19,829 --> 01:47:28,212
[SPEAKER_28]: Nintendo has this character, many people still know this character and love this character, and yet this character is yet to turn up in any type of Super Smash Bros.

1222
01:47:28,232 --> 01:47:28,952
[SPEAKER_28]: game or anything.

1223
01:47:29,617 --> 01:47:30,177
[SPEAKER_28]: What the hell?

1224
01:47:30,297 --> 01:47:32,498
[SPEAKER_28]: They could do a kick-ass game with Kid Icarus.

1225
01:47:32,738 --> 01:47:34,378
[SPEAKER_24]: Maybe the next Animal Crossing?

1226
01:47:36,098 --> 01:47:36,438
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1227
01:47:36,478 --> 01:47:36,919
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1228
01:47:37,199 --> 01:47:38,139
[SPEAKER_28]: We will see what happens.

1229
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:39,539
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1230
01:47:41,019 --> 01:47:41,600
[SPEAKER_28]: Moving on.

1231
01:47:42,380 --> 01:47:43,500
[SPEAKER_28]: Number two pick time.

1232
01:47:44,160 --> 01:47:45,440
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, your number two pick, please.

1233
01:47:46,561 --> 01:47:48,001
[SPEAKER_09]: The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

1234
01:47:48,961 --> 01:47:50,582
[SPEAKER_28]: The Sims, Sims in the Hood.

1235
01:47:51,502 --> 01:47:52,702
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not meaning like the herbs.

1236
01:47:52,882 --> 01:47:56,683
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean like we have ghetto Sims that have to go pick up their cheese.

1237
01:47:59,821 --> 01:48:05,125
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to spell that Sims with a Z. Oh, I did too.

1238
01:48:05,665 --> 01:48:06,146
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good.

1239
01:48:06,226 --> 01:48:06,566
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1240
01:48:07,687 --> 01:48:08,568
[SPEAKER_28]: Sims in the hood.

1241
01:48:10,229 --> 01:48:11,570
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, your number two pick, please.

1242
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:14,152
[SPEAKER_24]: This one's a request by Nelly.

1243
01:48:14,232 --> 01:48:16,373
[SPEAKER_24]: She wants the girl game.

1244
01:48:17,334 --> 01:48:21,617
[SPEAKER_24]: Much like the guy game, but, you know, no breasts and more cock shots.

1245
01:48:23,018 --> 01:48:27,081
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, funny you should mention this, because something similar is going to come up on my list, but we'll see.

1246
01:48:28,082 --> 01:48:29,303
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your number two pick.

1247
01:48:30,127 --> 01:48:35,892
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I was just looking at the poster over there and I just had to giggle at myself because I just picked something completely at random.

1248
01:48:37,033 --> 01:48:39,275
[SPEAKER_10]: Except I don't know if I want to call it one thing or the other.

1249
01:48:39,395 --> 01:48:45,740
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I was either going to say Kill Bill Online or something just because I was just being completely random.

1250
01:48:45,860 --> 01:48:47,801
[SPEAKER_28]: So Kill Bill the game or Kill Bill Online?

1251
01:48:50,083 --> 01:48:50,303
Oops.

1252
01:48:50,664 --> 01:48:51,824
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh oh.

1253
01:48:51,925 --> 01:48:53,626
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.

1254
01:48:53,646 --> 01:48:54,847
[SPEAKER_09]: I have to think of something new now.

1255
01:48:55,027 --> 01:48:55,968
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Kill Bill the RPG.

1256
01:48:56,974 --> 01:48:58,274
[SPEAKER_09]: That would have been cooler, see?

1257
01:48:58,394 --> 01:48:59,535
[SPEAKER_28]: You still would have gotten props from me.

1258
01:48:59,555 --> 01:49:01,355
[SPEAKER_28]: So do you want Kill Bill the RPG Angel?

1259
01:49:01,835 --> 01:49:02,056
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1260
01:49:02,616 --> 01:49:05,217
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, and she just stole Jamie's just like that.

1261
01:49:05,837 --> 01:49:06,457
[SPEAKER_28]: What a bitch.

1262
01:49:06,477 --> 01:49:07,257
[SPEAKER_10]: I hate you.

1263
01:49:07,377 --> 01:49:07,797
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1264
01:49:09,458 --> 01:49:11,879
[SPEAKER_28]: My number two pick is another serious one.

1265
01:49:13,099 --> 01:49:13,839
[SPEAKER_28]: Heaven forbid.

1266
01:49:14,599 --> 01:49:19,141
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to see a true sequel to Castlevania Symphony of the Night.

1267
01:49:19,561 --> 01:49:21,421
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm not talking those 3D bullshit.

1268
01:49:21,561 --> 01:49:21,982
[SPEAKER_28]: I want a 2D...

1269
01:49:24,028 --> 01:49:31,569
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful, I don't care what they do, I want a 2D Castlevania game that just fucking sleeps with me, it's that good.

1270
01:49:32,750 --> 01:49:34,870
[SPEAKER_28]: So I'm going to call it Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2.

1271
01:49:36,750 --> 01:49:38,111
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm done, actually.

1272
01:49:38,291 --> 01:49:39,011
[SPEAKER_09]: Announce for the DC.

1273
01:49:40,651 --> 01:49:40,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes.

1274
01:49:41,931 --> 01:49:46,092
[SPEAKER_28]: Then that is the game I most, no, okay, then I'm going to be specific.

1275
01:49:46,712 --> 01:49:48,132
[SPEAKER_28]: On PS2.

1276
01:49:48,592 --> 01:49:50,273
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sick of this handheld bullshit.

1277
01:49:50,353 --> 01:49:51,353
[SPEAKER_28]: I want one on a console.

1278
01:49:52,673 --> 01:49:54,374
[SPEAKER_09]: Put it on a good system and put it on the Xbox.

1279
01:49:54,614 --> 01:49:55,735
[SPEAKER_09]: So it'll actually look good.

1280
01:49:56,435 --> 01:49:57,036
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't give a shit.

1281
01:49:57,116 --> 01:49:57,616
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want it.

1282
01:49:57,836 --> 01:49:59,617
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't want it on a freaking handheld.

1283
01:49:59,657 --> 01:50:06,201
[SPEAKER_28]: I want it on the big TV so I can turn up the speakers and blast the shit out of the Castlevania music.

1284
01:50:08,762 --> 01:50:09,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, moving on.

1285
01:50:11,083 --> 01:50:12,924
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, did you manage to find a new number one?

1286
01:50:13,265 --> 01:50:14,065
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I guess so.

1287
01:50:14,145 --> 01:50:15,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, what is your new number one?

1288
01:50:15,806 --> 01:50:17,087
[SPEAKER_09]: Console Ragnarok Online.

1289
01:50:18,327 --> 01:50:19,328
[SPEAKER_09]: Fully customizable.

1290
01:50:23,027 --> 01:50:25,048
[SPEAKER_28]: Ragnarok Online to your console.

1291
01:50:25,328 --> 01:50:25,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Beautiful.

1292
01:50:26,989 --> 01:50:27,969
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, you're number one.

1293
01:50:28,869 --> 01:50:29,390
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't have one.

1294
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:30,750
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, sorry, Loki, you're number one.

1295
01:50:32,531 --> 01:50:33,071
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, man.

1296
01:50:35,252 --> 01:50:35,772
[SPEAKER_24]: Let's see.

1297
01:50:35,812 --> 01:50:37,233
[SPEAKER_24]: What would be a good game?

1298
01:50:40,314 --> 01:50:41,334
[SPEAKER_24]: I know, I know, I know.

1299
01:50:41,955 --> 01:50:43,395
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, let's... No, actually, that's going to suck.

1300
01:50:43,415 --> 01:50:45,536
[SPEAKER_27]: You're supposed to prep these.

1301
01:50:46,316 --> 01:50:46,876
[SPEAKER_24]: You know what?

1302
01:50:47,597 --> 01:50:48,117
[SPEAKER_24]: God damn it.

1303
01:50:48,641 --> 01:50:49,281
[SPEAKER_24]: How about this?

1304
01:50:49,341 --> 01:50:50,441
[SPEAKER_24]: This is going to be my game.

1305
01:50:50,481 --> 01:50:53,302
[SPEAKER_24]: It's called Get Off Your Ass and Get a Job, the game.

1306
01:50:55,483 --> 01:51:01,184
[SPEAKER_24]: This will teach those fat fuckers that play games all the time to fucking get off their ass, go outside and get a job.

1307
01:51:01,244 --> 01:51:03,705
[SPEAKER_24]: And provide for your family.

1308
01:51:06,105 --> 01:51:10,026
[SPEAKER_24]: It's not about leveling your fucking character, it's about getting a goddamn job.

1309
01:51:10,466 --> 01:51:11,226
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what it's about.

1310
01:51:11,967 --> 01:51:15,167
[SPEAKER_24]: Seriously, who gives a shit if you're a level 50 monk?

1311
01:51:15,707 --> 01:51:17,988
[SPEAKER_24]: You need to be earning some fucking cash.

1312
01:51:19,711 --> 01:51:24,815
[SPEAKER_24]: You're going to have a family out there and just because you can slay dragons doesn't mean you can fucking provide.

1313
01:51:25,416 --> 01:51:26,657
[SPEAKER_24]: So get a fucking job.

1314
01:51:26,737 --> 01:51:27,217
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

1315
01:51:28,338 --> 01:51:28,779
[SPEAKER_24]: That's my game.

1316
01:51:30,300 --> 01:51:31,321
[SPEAKER_28]: Get out and get a job.

1317
01:51:31,361 --> 01:51:31,821
[SPEAKER_28]: The game.

1318
01:51:32,222 --> 01:51:32,582
[SPEAKER_28]: Lovely.

1319
01:51:34,203 --> 01:51:37,166
[SPEAKER_28]: I wrote it down as get out and get a job.

1320
01:51:37,206 --> 01:51:38,687
[SPEAKER_28]: You want get out and get a fucking job?

1321
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:41,990
[SPEAKER_09]: There are plenty of people who would like a job fucking.

1322
01:51:42,030 --> 01:51:42,330
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1323
01:51:44,452 --> 01:51:46,674
[SPEAKER_28]: Now the ESRB may have problems with this.

1324
01:51:48,635 --> 01:51:58,183
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why they put it out on Xbox Alright, get up off your ass and get a fucking job the game, alright Uh, Angel, did you come up with the new number one over there?

1325
01:51:58,983 --> 01:52:17,918
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, Angel's number one Yeah, except I can't think of a city that I wanted to put in the name Happy Bunny Kills Everything, insert city name here Happy Bunny Kills Everything, the game Yes, I was trying to be random, leave me alone We're just gonna call it Happy Bunny Kills Everything, how's that?

1326
01:52:19,238 --> 01:52:23,481
[SPEAKER_28]: And Angel, for those that may not know, what is Happy Bunny?

1327
01:52:24,462 --> 01:52:25,143
[SPEAKER_28]: What is Happy Bunny?

1328
01:52:25,383 --> 01:52:26,264
[SPEAKER_09]: My personal avatar.

1329
01:52:27,384 --> 01:52:29,066
[SPEAKER_09]: Let Jamie do it because Jamie's cooler.

1330
01:52:29,766 --> 01:52:30,067
[SPEAKER_25]: Jamie?

1331
01:52:31,728 --> 01:52:38,193
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe that my favorite Happy Bunny line is this cute little bunny you see just looking all happy, all sweet and everything.

1332
01:52:38,573 --> 01:52:42,456
[SPEAKER_09]: My favorite one is, school prepares you for the real world, which also sucks.

1333
01:52:43,857 --> 01:52:48,361
[SPEAKER_09]: Or my other favorite one is, you icky people are nice, but you gotta go.

1334
01:52:49,548 --> 01:52:53,051
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't you think that Happy Bunny sold out a little bit thanks to Hot Topic?

1335
01:52:53,872 --> 01:52:55,653
[SPEAKER_09]: A little, but Happy Bunny's still cool.

1336
01:52:55,753 --> 01:52:57,695
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, all right.

1337
01:52:57,895 --> 01:53:04,701
[SPEAKER_28]: And the last one is my number one pick, and it's very similar to one that Loki put in earlier, but I had a different idea.

1338
01:53:05,461 --> 01:53:07,083
[SPEAKER_28]: You guys know the guy game, right?

1339
01:53:07,463 --> 01:53:13,768
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, we need a game that caters to the other percentage of the male population, the gay guy game, and that is my number one pick.

1340
01:53:17,612 --> 01:53:17,932
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1341
01:53:19,364 --> 01:53:21,786
[SPEAKER_28]: Now it's time for the elimination round.

1342
01:53:22,586 --> 01:53:24,728
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's read the list that we have so far.

1343
01:53:24,888 --> 01:53:30,412
[SPEAKER_28]: Each host will have to eliminate one song forever off of this list.

1344
01:53:30,452 --> 01:53:30,872
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

1345
01:53:30,992 --> 01:53:33,374
[SPEAKER_28]: We have... What?

1346
01:53:34,054 --> 01:53:34,775
[SPEAKER_24]: Not a song.

1347
01:53:34,835 --> 01:53:35,255
[SPEAKER_24]: No, you're right.

1348
01:53:35,275 --> 01:53:35,896
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not a song.

1349
01:53:35,936 --> 01:53:37,577
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an item from the list.

1350
01:53:37,617 --> 01:53:38,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Here we go.

1351
01:53:39,878 --> 01:53:40,519
[SPEAKER_28]: Number one.

1352
01:53:41,179 --> 01:53:43,501
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, not number one, but first item on the list.

1353
01:53:43,621 --> 01:53:45,182
[SPEAKER_28]: Pimp My Ride, the game.

1354
01:53:46,103 --> 01:53:47,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Roll My SUV, the game.

1355
01:53:48,365 --> 01:54:11,155
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Dimashy, Kid Icarus 2005, The Sims, Sims and the Hood, The Girl Game, Kill Bill, the RPG, Castlevania Symphony of the Night 2, console please, Console Ragnarok Online, Get Up Off Your Ass and Get a Fucking Job, the game, Happy Bunny Kills Everything, and the Gay Guy game.

1356
01:54:12,776 --> 01:54:13,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Jamie?

1357
01:54:13,776 --> 01:54:13,876
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie?

1358
01:54:14,901 --> 01:54:16,422
[SPEAKER_28]: You get the first elimination.

1359
01:54:16,462 --> 01:54:23,367
[SPEAKER_21]: What's coming off the list?

1360
01:54:23,747 --> 01:54:33,614
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I'm going to have to kick off... Goddamn.

1361
01:54:33,654 --> 01:54:35,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Get off your ass and get a fucking job at the game.

1362
01:54:35,636 --> 01:54:36,136
[SPEAKER_28]: Really?

1363
01:54:37,357 --> 01:54:38,938
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I would have thought this would have been your anthem.

1364
01:54:39,018 --> 01:54:41,140
[SPEAKER_09]: It's sort of defeating the purpose.

1365
01:54:42,714 --> 01:54:46,417
[SPEAKER_09]: You could play about getting a fucking job, but you could get a fucking job.

1366
01:54:48,679 --> 01:54:50,180
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, defeat the purpose.

1367
01:54:50,280 --> 01:54:51,101
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, Loki.

1368
01:54:53,563 --> 01:54:59,408
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm going to have to take off Ragnarok Online, the console game, because that game sucks and doesn't deserve to be on console.

1369
01:55:00,068 --> 01:55:01,469
[SPEAKER_24]: It's made by Koreans.

1370
01:55:01,589 --> 01:55:04,972
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the same can be said about Final Fantasy XI, which also sucks.

1371
01:55:06,213 --> 01:55:07,714
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, but that's on a console already.

1372
01:55:07,874 --> 01:55:08,395
[SPEAKER_24]: D'oh!

1373
01:55:08,951 --> 01:55:09,772
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and it still sucks.

1374
01:55:09,812 --> 01:55:11,493
[SPEAKER_28]: Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.

1375
01:55:11,933 --> 01:55:13,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, take it outside.

1376
01:55:13,134 --> 01:55:14,194
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's put it on webcam.

1377
01:55:14,395 --> 01:55:15,415
[SPEAKER_28]: Kick the shit out of each other.

1378
01:55:15,775 --> 01:55:17,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't go on webcam, and I would win.

1379
01:55:17,617 --> 01:55:19,858
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1380
01:55:20,058 --> 01:55:20,719
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel, your turn.

1381
01:55:20,799 --> 01:55:21,279
[SPEAKER_28]: One's got to go.

1382
01:55:23,941 --> 01:55:25,382
[SPEAKER_10]: I was going to pick my own, but never mind.

1383
01:55:25,562 --> 01:55:27,143
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll just do Roll My SUV, the game.

1384
01:55:27,163 --> 01:55:28,604
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry, Loki.

1385
01:55:28,624 --> 01:55:29,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Roll My SUV, the game.

1386
01:55:29,865 --> 01:55:30,185
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

1387
01:55:30,225 --> 01:55:32,106
[SPEAKER_28]: I was looking at that one, too, because I didn't get the joke either.

1388
01:55:32,726 --> 01:55:36,289
[SPEAKER_28]: And I'm going to... I know, I get it.

1389
01:55:36,469 --> 01:55:36,489
[SPEAKER_28]: I...

1390
01:55:37,362 --> 01:55:46,208
[SPEAKER_28]: I will eliminate DDR Dimashy with respect to our chatroom because I know it was their idea, but I'm just not sure how to spell Dimashy, and I'm not going to make an ass out of myself.

1391
01:55:46,969 --> 01:55:47,989
[SPEAKER_10]: It's okay, Rob.

1392
01:55:51,012 --> 01:55:54,874
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, so we have a final list here, and you guys get to place your vote.

1393
01:55:55,214 --> 01:56:00,238
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's bring back our own version of Don Pardo to read the choices you have to pick from.

1394
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:05,000
[SPEAKER_23]: That's right!

1395
01:56:05,381 --> 01:56:11,350
[SPEAKER_23]: Here are the choices that you get to vote from tonight for video game you most want to see in 2005!

1396
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:12,892
[SPEAKER_23]: Pimp My Ride!

1397
01:56:12,912 --> 01:56:14,194
[SPEAKER_23]: The Game!

1399
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:38,700
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright!

1400
01:56:39,921 --> 01:56:41,242
[SPEAKER_23]: Thank you for playing!

1401
01:56:43,363 --> 01:56:43,643
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1402
01:56:44,457 --> 01:56:45,117
[SPEAKER_28]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1403
01:57:13,226 --> 01:57:14,447
[SPEAKER_28]: and allow folks to call in.

1404
01:57:15,367 --> 01:57:19,469
[SPEAKER_28]: And we'll also get into... What else were we going to do?

1405
01:57:19,509 --> 01:57:20,729
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, we have to do the FUs of the week.

1406
01:57:20,989 --> 01:57:22,150
[SPEAKER_28]: But don't send those in just yet.

1407
01:57:22,190 --> 01:57:23,930
[SPEAKER_28]: I want votes for listless first.

1408
01:57:24,571 --> 01:57:26,612
[SPEAKER_28]: And then, I don't know.

1409
01:57:26,992 --> 01:57:27,632
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what else.

1410
01:57:27,792 --> 01:57:31,894
[SPEAKER_28]: But we're going to let you guys call in the Skype line when we come back about whatever you want.

1411
01:57:32,494 --> 01:57:35,995
[SPEAKER_28]: If you don't know what the Skype line is all about, www.orangeonstrider.com.

1412
01:57:36,015 --> 01:57:37,196
[SPEAKER_28]: Click on Interact With Us.

1413
01:57:37,896 --> 01:57:42,298
[SPEAKER_28]: Meanwhile, we're going to go to a break featuring Utter Randomness from Bomani.

1414
01:57:42,776 --> 01:57:43,296
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back.

1415
01:57:51,542 --> 01:57:52,263
We'll be back.

1416
01:58:06,795 --> 01:58:07,816
DarkSakura.com

1417
01:58:26,001 --> 01:58:27,643
Love, love, love

1418
01:58:51,380 --> 01:59:10,950
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, simply be in love Yeah, yeah, simply be in love Yeah, yeah, simply be in love Yeah Simply be loved It's more than enough Simply be loved It's more than enough

1419
01:59:20,872 --> 01:59:25,589
[SPEAKER_14]: Simply because, it's more than enough

1420
02:02:19,567 --> 02:02:20,847
Wow, he's quite a personality.

1421
02:02:55,492 --> 02:03:03,788
[SPEAKER_14]: Close your eyes Close your eyes and let us fly You and I

1422
02:03:05,714 --> 02:03:31,546
[SPEAKER_14]: Together we can touch the sky I was walking down the street You came like a summer breeze Sweeping my breath away It doesn't happen every day You and I together in the sky Forever young, we can never die DarkSakura

1423
02:03:36,138 --> 02:03:37,861
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

1424
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:08,474
Close your eyes and let us fly, you and I, together we can touch the sky.

1425
02:04:41,916 --> 02:04:51,267
[SPEAKER_02]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

1426
02:04:52,015 --> 02:04:56,097
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

1427
02:04:56,118 --> 02:04:57,078
[SPEAKER_28]: Can we talk about that?

1428
02:04:57,358 --> 02:04:59,700
[SPEAKER_21]: No subject will ever be taboo.

1429
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:03,642
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

1430
02:05:04,162 --> 02:05:06,684
[SPEAKER_28]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

1431
02:05:07,204 --> 02:05:12,547
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

1432
02:05:13,107 --> 02:05:14,388
[SPEAKER_24]: I collect your fucking head.

1433
02:05:16,337 --> 02:05:17,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Just like this fucker here.

1434
02:05:18,938 --> 02:05:22,621
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

1435
02:05:22,901 --> 02:05:26,283
[SPEAKER_23]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

1436
02:05:27,223 --> 02:05:33,667
[SPEAKER_17]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

1437
02:05:34,867 --> 02:05:38,669
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

1438
02:05:42,892 --> 02:05:44,953
[SPEAKER_28]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and...

1439
02:05:45,615 --> 02:05:51,398
[SPEAKER_28]: We're about ready to reveal the winners of tonight's list list, the definitive list of games we most want to see in 2005.

1440
02:05:52,318 --> 02:05:58,241
[SPEAKER_28]: It's very funny, though, because the chat room was just going off on these ideas about Orange Lounge Radio, the game.

1441
02:05:59,541 --> 02:06:02,402
[SPEAKER_28]: Phoenix in the chat room says, Orange Lounge Radio, the game.

1442
02:06:02,442 --> 02:06:12,627
[SPEAKER_28]: You could be one of the broadcasters, and then if Loki says something retarded or votes for a bad song, he would promptly be shot with an RPG or a large rifle.

1443
02:06:12,707 --> 02:06:14,208
[SPEAKER_28]: Failure to do so will cause you to lose.

1444
02:06:14,248 --> 02:06:15,008
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, I like that idea.

1445
02:06:17,168 --> 02:06:19,029
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's see, what else is it?

1446
02:06:19,129 --> 02:06:24,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 says, make it an RPG where you guide the Orange Lawns Radio guys to the studio before the show starts.

1447
02:06:25,291 --> 02:06:27,292
[SPEAKER_28]: K-Dash says, make sure they get there before 6.

1448
02:06:28,092 --> 02:06:28,312
[SPEAKER_28]: Ha!

1449
02:06:29,073 --> 02:06:34,655
[SPEAKER_28]: More like real life, make it before they get here by 6.32, because that's about what time they usually get here.

1450
02:06:35,475 --> 02:06:36,035
[SPEAKER_28]: Hardy har.

1451
02:06:37,696 --> 02:06:38,396
[SPEAKER_26]: Ah, funny stuff.

1452
02:06:39,710 --> 02:06:43,832
[SPEAKER_28]: BlackDevilerX says, Orange Lens Radio, the game definitely belongs on the PlayStation 2.

1453
02:06:44,532 --> 02:06:48,434
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, so we can be badly anti-alias just like all the rest of the games on PS2.

1454
02:06:48,474 --> 02:06:49,055
[SPEAKER_28]: That'd be great.

1455
02:06:49,255 --> 02:06:50,975
[SPEAKER_28]: We could look very pixelated on the edges.

1456
02:06:51,236 --> 02:06:51,676
[SPEAKER_28]: Be hot.

1457
02:06:52,396 --> 02:06:52,836
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait.

1458
02:06:54,317 --> 02:06:56,678
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, what do you think of Orange Lens Radio, the game?

1459
02:06:56,718 --> 02:06:57,639
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care.

1460
02:06:57,679 --> 02:06:58,339
[SPEAKER_28]: Get with the show.

1461
02:07:01,260 --> 02:07:05,582
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that I would have to go around with hammers hitting people in the head with them in the game.

1462
02:07:06,403 --> 02:07:06,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Love you.

1463
02:07:07,773 --> 02:07:09,054
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, you can go back to the wedding talk now.

1464
02:07:09,074 --> 02:07:09,634
[SPEAKER_28]: Girl talk.

1465
02:07:10,475 --> 02:07:11,655
[SPEAKER_28]: With the silent Nelly.

1466
02:07:12,396 --> 02:07:12,616
[SPEAKER_28]: Angel?

1467
02:07:12,776 --> 02:07:14,497
[SPEAKER_10]: Does that mean I can kill everybody with halos?

1468
02:07:14,537 --> 02:07:15,317
[SPEAKER_10]: Oops, did I say that?

1469
02:07:16,818 --> 02:07:17,579
[SPEAKER_10]: And stuff.

1470
02:07:18,699 --> 02:07:19,400
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I'm not funny.

1471
02:07:19,720 --> 02:07:20,200
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, bye.

1472
02:07:21,521 --> 02:07:27,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, let's get into tonight's winners from Listless.

1473
02:07:30,787 --> 02:07:31,627
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright!

1474
02:07:32,948 --> 02:07:36,230
[SPEAKER_23]: And now it's time to reveal the top three...

1475
02:07:37,515 --> 02:08:06,703
[SPEAKER_23]: Games we most want to see in 2005 Number 3 Kid Icarus 2005 Number 2 Happy Bunny Kills Everything And the number 1 game we most want to see in 2005 Kill Bill The RPG I'm taking half credit for that, you know You should, you should

1476
02:08:07,558 --> 02:08:10,019
[SPEAKER_14]: Go ahead.

1477
02:08:10,059 --> 02:08:10,779
[SPEAKER_28]: There it is.

1478
02:08:11,559 --> 02:08:13,260
[SPEAKER_28]: The definitive list.

1479
02:08:14,280 --> 02:08:21,582
[SPEAKER_28]: As pissed off as this chat room is that I took off DDR Dimashy, and they're saying, Sky's an idiot if he can't spell Dimashy.

1480
02:08:21,642 --> 02:08:23,502
[SPEAKER_28]: He's an idiot for taking us off the list.

1481
02:08:23,522 --> 02:08:24,363
[SPEAKER_28]: You idiot!

1482
02:08:25,443 --> 02:08:26,583
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know what?

1483
02:08:26,823 --> 02:08:27,583
[SPEAKER_28]: I just didn't get it.

1484
02:08:27,663 --> 02:08:27,964
[SPEAKER_28]: Sorry.

1485
02:08:27,984 --> 02:08:31,244
[SPEAKER_24]: Katamari Dimashy 2 coming out this year, so shut up.

1486
02:08:31,745 --> 02:08:32,405
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

1487
02:08:32,685 --> 02:08:34,645
[SPEAKER_28]: You're getting Katamari Dimashy 2, so shut up.

1488
02:08:35,426 --> 02:08:35,766
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1489
02:08:39,557 --> 02:08:43,199
[SPEAKER_28]: As I promised, we're going to go over and open up the Skype line.

1490
02:08:43,479 --> 02:08:48,321
[SPEAKER_28]: So if you want to call in on the Skype line, we will basically take your calls about just about anything.

1491
02:08:49,041 --> 02:08:54,023
[SPEAKER_28]: www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us.

1492
02:08:54,103 --> 02:08:55,804
[SPEAKER_28]: And look, the chat room is going off again.

1493
02:08:55,864 --> 02:08:57,465
[SPEAKER_28]: It says, you didn't get it?

1494
02:08:57,845 --> 02:08:59,065
[SPEAKER_16]: What's wrong with you?

1495
02:08:59,625 --> 02:09:01,646
[SPEAKER_28]: I think they're just making fun of me.

1496
02:09:01,686 --> 02:09:02,026
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1497
02:09:03,167 --> 02:09:03,807
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, let's see.

1498
02:09:03,827 --> 02:09:04,688
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to take a call.

1499
02:09:06,068 --> 02:09:07,869
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1500
02:09:09,093 --> 02:09:10,795
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello Sky, it's Elmullet again.

1501
02:09:10,895 --> 02:09:12,817
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello Elmullet, how are you my friend?

1502
02:09:13,397 --> 02:09:15,419
[SPEAKER_12]: I am doing good Sky, how about yourself?

1503
02:09:15,559 --> 02:09:16,780
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, long time no talk?

1504
02:09:17,561 --> 02:09:22,506
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, long time no listen, I just got... As with most people, it's alright.

1505
02:09:23,987 --> 02:09:26,409
[SPEAKER_12]: I take my sabbaticals from things every now and then.

1506
02:09:26,710 --> 02:09:27,891
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay, it's alright.

1507
02:09:27,931 --> 02:09:30,133
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what's new in the Elmullet world?

1508
02:09:32,008 --> 02:09:36,131
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, in the Elmullet world, I've recently restarted Encore Extra Stage.

1509
02:09:36,151 --> 02:09:38,332
[SPEAKER_12]: You will be receiving your weekly plug as always.

1510
02:09:38,573 --> 02:09:38,913
[SPEAKER_25]: Hot!

1511
02:09:40,814 --> 02:09:44,757
[SPEAKER_12]: And I've been, I've actually gone a bit mainstream.

1512
02:09:44,817 --> 02:09:48,980
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't stop playing Grand Theft Auto 3, I mean, San Andreas for some reason.

1513
02:09:49,800 --> 02:09:51,161
[SPEAKER_28]: Because you like the N-word?

1514
02:09:51,221 --> 02:09:53,703
[SPEAKER_28]: Because that's about the only reason I can see to keep playing that game.

1515
02:09:54,403 --> 02:09:54,704
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

1516
02:09:54,724 --> 02:09:56,045
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, the N-word is funny.

1517
02:09:56,285 --> 02:09:57,746
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't quote half the game.

1518
02:09:58,346 --> 02:10:02,649
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Loki, you were playing San Andreas for a while, but you stopped.

1519
02:10:02,689 --> 02:10:03,429
[SPEAKER_28]: What happened, Loki?

1520
02:10:04,390 --> 02:10:04,810
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, fancy.

1521
02:10:06,151 --> 02:10:08,153
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly, exactly.

1522
02:10:09,533 --> 02:10:13,396
[SPEAKER_28]: No, seriously, in all seriousness, what is it about San Andreas that's drawing you to that game?

1523
02:10:14,364 --> 02:10:15,725
[SPEAKER_12]: I really don't know what it is.

1524
02:10:15,925 --> 02:10:19,508
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, for some reason, I like the Grand Theft Auto formula.

1525
02:10:19,708 --> 02:10:21,510
[SPEAKER_12]: I like the basic gameplay about it.

1526
02:10:21,930 --> 02:10:26,674
[SPEAKER_12]: And this one actually has a good story that goes along with it.

1527
02:10:27,675 --> 02:10:29,136
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very compelling one.

1528
02:10:29,316 --> 02:10:33,219
[SPEAKER_12]: It relies mostly on gang warfare than mob warfare.

1529
02:10:34,881 --> 02:10:36,302
[SPEAKER_12]: And the story is pretty well done.

1530
02:10:37,017 --> 02:10:42,818
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what I like about the Grand Theft Auto games is the fact that you can kind of just go around anywhere and do anything.

1531
02:10:43,178 --> 02:10:46,419
[SPEAKER_28]: You don't really have to go and follow along the story if you want.

1532
02:10:46,539 --> 02:10:48,479
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, sure, it'll open up new areas and new stuff.

1533
02:10:49,199 --> 02:10:55,200
[SPEAKER_28]: But hell, put in the cheat codes and you can do whatever the hell you want and you can start blowing away people with rockets and start running from the police.

1534
02:10:55,501 --> 02:10:57,761
[SPEAKER_28]: That's my favorite part of the game is running away from the police.

1535
02:10:58,881 --> 02:10:59,501
[SPEAKER_28]: Me personally.

1536
02:11:01,082 --> 02:11:03,222
[SPEAKER_28]: So what did you think of the list there that we came up with?

1537
02:11:04,344 --> 02:11:04,845
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

1538
02:11:04,865 --> 02:11:06,447
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked the list.

1539
02:11:06,627 --> 02:11:07,808
[SPEAKER_12]: Kid Icarus made it on there.

1540
02:11:07,968 --> 02:11:10,251
[SPEAKER_28]: Any particular game you think should have been on the list that wasn't?

1541
02:11:12,133 --> 02:11:15,738
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't really think of any one specifically.

1542
02:11:16,756 --> 02:11:23,398
[SPEAKER_28]: I had Beatmania 2DX USA on there because I do think that they should come out with a 2DX USA.

1543
02:11:25,699 --> 02:11:40,123
[SPEAKER_12]: Truthfully, it looks as though an American release of a 2DX or something along those lines is a bit more realized than it would be, say, like a year ago because all of a sudden we see all these music games coming out in the U.S.,

1544
02:11:40,683 --> 02:11:56,890
[SPEAKER_12]: With their various controllers, we have a Donkey Konga, we have Taiko, Notatsujin, and it seems as though that if these things are really taking off, it would give Konami more incentive to look into porting some of their other Bimani over here.

1545
02:11:57,702 --> 02:11:58,262
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope so.

1546
02:11:58,482 --> 02:11:59,723
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope it's being incentive for them.

1547
02:11:59,763 --> 02:12:00,643
[SPEAKER_28]: I guess we'll find out.

1548
02:12:00,723 --> 02:12:04,745
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping that we're in for a treat at E3 this year, but I'm not going to hold my breath either.

1549
02:12:05,145 --> 02:12:11,648
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm expecting to see Karaoke Revolution 4, Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3, which honestly wouldn't be a bad lineup.

1550
02:12:11,688 --> 02:12:12,308
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't get me wrong.

1551
02:12:12,388 --> 02:12:14,649
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, they have to do an Ultramix 3.

1552
02:12:14,749 --> 02:12:15,129
[SPEAKER_28]: Have to.

1553
02:12:15,350 --> 02:12:15,790
[SPEAKER_28]: No choice.

1554
02:12:17,430 --> 02:12:18,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Ultramix 2 is the best.

1555
02:12:18,691 --> 02:12:18,951
[SPEAKER_28]: Do you?

1556
02:12:20,172 --> 02:12:20,892
[SPEAKER_28]: I highly agree.

1557
02:12:21,851 --> 02:12:24,912
[SPEAKER_28]: So you were mentioning your column, which is Encore Extra Stage.

1558
02:12:24,972 --> 02:12:28,933
[SPEAKER_28]: I will give you a chance to plug it, since you plug us so kindly in your column.

1559
02:12:29,093 --> 02:12:30,853
[SPEAKER_28]: Let the listeners know where they can read your column.

1560
02:12:31,733 --> 02:12:45,896
[SPEAKER_12]: Go to www.insidepulse.com or to go directly to my section, games.insidepulse.com I have a Friday column, Encore Extra Stage.

1561
02:12:46,877 --> 02:12:48,017
[SPEAKER_12]: It's numbered and everything.

1562
02:12:50,261 --> 02:12:51,582
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a pretty good read.

1563
02:12:51,722 --> 02:12:52,762
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty good read indeed.

1564
02:12:52,902 --> 02:12:53,823
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a mediocre read.

1565
02:12:53,883 --> 02:12:54,403
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm kidding.

1566
02:12:54,423 --> 02:12:55,103
[SPEAKER_28]: It's a very good read.

1567
02:12:55,163 --> 02:12:57,284
[SPEAKER_28]: Thank you, Scott.

1568
02:12:57,584 --> 02:12:58,224
[SPEAKER_28]: Anytime.

1569
02:12:58,284 --> 02:12:58,664
[SPEAKER_28]: Anytime.

1570
02:12:58,904 --> 02:12:59,645
[SPEAKER_28]: It's okay.

1571
02:13:00,065 --> 02:13:06,187
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, I guess if I'm done looking at porn, it's something I can go look at, you know, while I'm kind of coming down.

1572
02:13:06,207 --> 02:13:07,228
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the majority of my fan base.

1573
02:13:07,428 --> 02:13:08,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Stinky-fingered porn watchers.

1574
02:13:11,649 --> 02:13:12,430
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, same thing.

1575
02:13:12,610 --> 02:13:13,150
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, you know what?

1576
02:13:13,170 --> 02:13:15,771
[SPEAKER_28]: We have people that listen to this show while looking at porn.

1577
02:13:15,851 --> 02:13:16,471
[SPEAKER_28]: So, you know...

1578
02:13:19,167 --> 02:13:34,957
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know how people could listen to this show while looking at porn, because I think listening to this show would just be... I can just see them, all of a sudden, Loki's face appearing on a girl's body.

1579
02:13:35,838 --> 02:13:36,939
[SPEAKER_28]: What else was I going to say?

1580
02:13:37,139 --> 02:13:39,900
[SPEAKER_28]: Over on Inside Pulse, you guys do a lot of game reviews, right?

1581
02:13:40,141 --> 02:13:41,822
[SPEAKER_28]: Not just you, but the other folks over there, right?

1582
02:13:42,362 --> 02:13:43,863
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, yeah.

1583
02:13:44,063 --> 02:13:45,684
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you guys do any sort of top 2004 list?

1584
02:13:48,002 --> 02:13:50,703
[SPEAKER_12]: We did a 2004 awards segment, actually.

1585
02:13:50,843 --> 02:13:53,864
[SPEAKER_28]: And what was the best game of 2004?

1586
02:13:55,244 --> 02:13:56,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Best game of 2004?

1587
02:13:57,485 --> 02:13:58,905
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me a second, let me look it up.

1588
02:13:59,005 --> 02:14:01,226
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been a tiny bit since I started.

1589
02:14:04,267 --> 02:14:05,987
[SPEAKER_28]: How about you personally, while you're looking?

1590
02:14:07,207 --> 02:14:08,028
[SPEAKER_12]: Me personally?

1591
02:14:08,108 --> 02:14:13,809
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess it would be a tie in between Katamari Damacy and Pokemon FireRedLeafGreen.

1592
02:14:14,449 --> 02:14:14,770
[SPEAKER_28]: Really?

1593
02:14:14,790 --> 02:14:16,410
[SPEAKER_28]: You liked Pokemon that much, huh?

1594
02:14:17,173 --> 02:14:20,535
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a Pokemon fan, to be brutally honest with you.

1595
02:14:21,336 --> 02:14:23,337
[SPEAKER_12]: I've been a fan since the Red Blue days.

1596
02:14:23,778 --> 02:14:25,299
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a very engrossing game.

1597
02:14:26,099 --> 02:14:31,984
[SPEAKER_12]: I love the fact that it's freeform after you go through all the main quests.

1598
02:14:32,604 --> 02:14:36,227
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought it was good, but I don't know if I could name it Best of 2004.

1599
02:14:37,067 --> 02:14:38,448
[SPEAKER_24]: To each their own.

1600
02:14:38,688 --> 02:14:39,069
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki!

1601
02:14:39,749 --> 02:14:41,010
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my nomination for Best of 2004.

1602
02:14:41,050 --> 02:14:44,573
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I guess it would be kind of Best of 2005, but it started in 2004.

1603
02:14:45,751 --> 02:14:49,213
[SPEAKER_24]: It would be Gary's Mod, version 5 for Half-Life 2.

1604
02:14:50,914 --> 02:14:51,314
[SPEAKER_16]: Why?

1605
02:14:52,055 --> 02:14:52,435
Why?

1606
02:14:53,135 --> 02:14:55,977
[SPEAKER_24]: Because you can pose people and make funny pictures.

1607
02:14:56,237 --> 02:15:02,701
[SPEAKER_24]: For instance, they have, and you can find this all at www.gary.tv slash Gary's Mod.

1608
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:05,122
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, the one with the baby launcher.

1609
02:15:05,743 --> 02:15:06,743
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, exactly.

1610
02:15:07,224 --> 02:15:11,066
[SPEAKER_24]: It says you can string up a combine soldier and fire dead babies at him.

1611
02:15:12,072 --> 02:15:13,233
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's the dead babies.

1612
02:15:13,573 --> 02:15:18,857
[SPEAKER_24]: And there's also one that says, position ragdolls so they look like they've had a baby.

1613
02:15:21,659 --> 02:15:22,580
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just so much fun.

1614
02:15:22,680 --> 02:15:24,721
[SPEAKER_24]: This is like, this is what we need.

1615
02:15:26,002 --> 02:15:28,884
[SPEAKER_28]: Only you would vote for the game with the dead baby launcher.

1616
02:15:29,164 --> 02:15:30,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd vote for a game with a dead baby launcher.

1617
02:15:30,966 --> 02:15:31,906
[SPEAKER_09]: That's pretty cool.

1618
02:15:32,207 --> 02:15:33,568
[SPEAKER_28]: Post that link in our chat if you can.

1619
02:15:33,588 --> 02:15:34,528
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't get it.

1620
02:15:34,648 --> 02:15:35,449
[SPEAKER_28]: All right, all right, all right.

1621
02:15:36,334 --> 02:15:37,955
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry, Mullet, we forgot all about you.

1622
02:15:38,095 --> 02:15:40,916
[SPEAKER_28]: And that game that you guys, you were looking at there?

1623
02:15:42,237 --> 02:15:44,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Best of 2004, according to the Inside Pulse, folks?

1624
02:15:44,918 --> 02:15:47,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Inside Pulse, it was Katamari Damacy.

1625
02:15:47,719 --> 02:15:48,540
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not surprised.

1626
02:15:49,240 --> 02:15:51,821
[SPEAKER_12]: With GTA SA following up as runner-up.

1627
02:15:52,381 --> 02:15:53,422
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm also not surprised.

1628
02:15:53,762 --> 02:16:00,365
[SPEAKER_28]: Now, wait, I'm kind of surprised that Halo 2 isn't mentioned there somewhere, but you're a very anti-Halo kind of guy, if I remember right, right?

1629
02:16:01,365 --> 02:16:04,427
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, mostly because of the fucking hype.

1630
02:16:04,447 --> 02:16:04,667
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1631
02:16:05,163 --> 02:16:06,624
[SPEAKER_12]: The hype killed the game.

1632
02:16:06,644 --> 02:16:07,044
[SPEAKER_28]: Wait, what?

1633
02:16:07,104 --> 02:16:07,745
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have Halo 2 yet.

1634
02:16:07,765 --> 02:16:10,667
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't even play it, but I have a character made for it.

1635
02:16:28,917 --> 02:16:30,018
[SPEAKER_28]: I just think it's kind of interesting.

1636
02:16:30,459 --> 02:16:32,160
[SPEAKER_28]: What about the hype ruined the game?

1637
02:16:32,220 --> 02:16:38,486
[SPEAKER_28]: Just the fact that, you know, it was the overnight people waiting out in line or just the... Oh, not even that.

1638
02:16:38,526 --> 02:16:40,107
[SPEAKER_12]: We're talking about a year ago.

1639
02:16:40,247 --> 02:16:44,651
[SPEAKER_12]: It was named best game on the Xbox without anybody playing it.

1640
02:16:44,972 --> 02:16:45,212
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1641
02:16:45,932 --> 02:16:46,113
[SPEAKER_12]: You know...

1642
02:16:47,240 --> 02:16:51,102
[SPEAKER_28]: I'll tell you what bugged me about Halo 2 was the fact... I mean, I love Halo 2.

1643
02:16:51,402 --> 02:16:52,162
[SPEAKER_28]: It's an awesome game.

1644
02:16:52,182 --> 02:16:53,383
[SPEAKER_28]: Me, personally, I love it.

1645
02:16:54,063 --> 02:16:55,964
[SPEAKER_28]: I do agree the hype was a little bit much.

1646
02:16:56,024 --> 02:16:57,545
[SPEAKER_28]: Here's my biggest problem with Halo 2.

1647
02:16:58,225 --> 02:17:04,888
[SPEAKER_28]: It was Halo 1 with Xbox Live and a kind of better story mode, a more theatric story mode.

1648
02:17:05,169 --> 02:17:05,529
[SPEAKER_09]: No way.

1649
02:17:05,589 --> 02:17:07,850
[SPEAKER_09]: It had the flying things, but...

1650
02:17:08,720 --> 02:17:09,440
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1651
02:17:28,069 --> 02:17:29,329
[SPEAKER_09]: with his Inviso armor.

1652
02:17:29,690 --> 02:17:35,912
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I don't want the Halo fans sending me a nasty gram going, you faggot, why don't you like the Halo games?

1653
02:17:35,932 --> 02:17:36,672
[SPEAKER_28]: What is wrong with you?

1654
02:17:37,012 --> 02:17:38,253
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, I bought Halo.

1655
02:17:38,453 --> 02:17:39,493
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Halo.

1656
02:17:39,813 --> 02:17:40,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Like.

1657
02:17:40,894 --> 02:17:41,274
[SPEAKER_28]: Like.

1658
02:17:41,614 --> 02:17:42,614
[SPEAKER_28]: I just don't love it.

1659
02:17:43,855 --> 02:17:51,397
[SPEAKER_09]: The Arbiter's level, though, is really aggravating because you don't know who you're trying to kill because they're all freaking Covenant guys.

1660
02:17:52,018 --> 02:17:52,258
[SPEAKER_28]: I know.

1661
02:17:52,438 --> 02:17:52,978
[SPEAKER_28]: It's confusing.

1662
02:17:53,618 --> 02:17:53,878
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1663
02:17:54,879 --> 02:17:55,699
[SPEAKER_09]: And then I get motion sick.

1664
02:17:57,258 --> 02:17:59,580
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other thoughts, Mullet, on gaming?

1665
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,401
[SPEAKER_28]: What's going on right now or anything in general?

1666
02:18:01,421 --> 02:18:10,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, going on to gaming cults and people emailing you going, you're an idiot if you don't like this, that, and the other thing.

1667
02:18:10,548 --> 02:18:14,651
[SPEAKER_12]: I got my first In The Groove fanboy email.

1668
02:18:14,991 --> 02:18:15,612
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, goody!

1669
02:18:16,232 --> 02:18:17,674
[SPEAKER_28]: I haven't gotten any of those yet.

1670
02:18:18,034 --> 02:18:19,975
[SPEAKER_28]: Rob at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

1671
02:18:21,084 --> 02:18:22,605
[SPEAKER_28]: In the Groove is not that great.

1672
02:18:22,865 --> 02:18:24,305
[SPEAKER_28]: Send your emails away, okay?

1673
02:18:24,525 --> 02:18:25,065
[SPEAKER_28]: There you go.

1674
02:18:25,265 --> 02:18:25,686
[SPEAKER_28]: I said it.

1675
02:18:26,406 --> 02:18:32,208
[SPEAKER_12]: I personally can't comment on the game because there is no machine within a 500 mile radius of my house.

1676
02:18:32,328 --> 02:18:32,628
[SPEAKER_28]: Yikes.

1677
02:18:33,548 --> 02:18:40,951
[SPEAKER_12]: But the guy emails my cookie column, which I wrote five months ago, and takes it completely out of context.

1678
02:18:41,191 --> 02:18:45,332
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh boy, you think they put in Moonlight Shadow because of your suggestion?

1679
02:18:45,412 --> 02:18:46,473
[SPEAKER_12]: You are selfish.

1680
02:18:46,613 --> 02:18:47,653
[SPEAKER_12]: In the Groove rocks.

1681
02:18:50,215 --> 02:18:51,936
[SPEAKER_28]: Are you going to respond to it in your next column?

1682
02:18:52,816 --> 02:18:57,977
[SPEAKER_12]: I've already responded it to him, and I'm going to print it up front and center in the next column, pretty much.

1683
02:18:58,137 --> 02:18:58,957
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait!

1684
02:18:59,857 --> 02:19:00,297
[SPEAKER_28]: Can't wait.

1685
02:19:02,418 --> 02:19:03,278
[SPEAKER_28]: Silly fanboys.

1686
02:19:03,458 --> 02:19:12,880
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, but if you do want to send fanboy or fangirl mail to Orange Lounge Radio, you can send it to either Rob at Orange Lounge Radio, Jamie at Orange Lounge Radio, or Loki at Orange Lounge Radio.

1687
02:19:12,920 --> 02:19:15,301
[SPEAKER_28]: We all have those addresses, so have fun.

1688
02:19:16,581 --> 02:19:16,861
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1689
02:19:17,502 --> 02:19:19,302
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else you want to share, Al Mullet, before I hang up on you?

1690
02:19:20,270 --> 02:19:21,772
[SPEAKER_12]: You can go ahead and hang up now.

1691
02:19:21,852 --> 02:19:22,493
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

1692
02:19:22,633 --> 02:19:23,294
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one, Mullen.

1693
02:19:23,314 --> 02:19:23,814
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for calling.

1694
02:19:25,832 --> 02:19:26,432
[SPEAKER_28]: I cut him off.

1695
02:19:26,472 --> 02:19:27,132
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm so rude.

1696
02:19:27,812 --> 02:19:28,453
[SPEAKER_28]: I didn't mean to.

1697
02:19:28,673 --> 02:19:29,073
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1698
02:19:29,413 --> 02:19:33,494
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to keep the Skype line open if anybody else wants to call in.

1699
02:19:33,834 --> 02:19:38,775
[SPEAKER_28]: As much as we enjoy El Mullet and talking to him on the show, I had to let him go because I wanted to see if anybody else wanted to call.

1700
02:19:39,315 --> 02:19:41,255
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to give other folks an opportunity here.

1701
02:19:41,755 --> 02:19:42,575
[SPEAKER_28]: What are you looking at now?

1702
02:19:42,615 --> 02:19:48,137
[SPEAKER_28]: You're still on this Gary's Mod thing for Half-Life 2, which, by the way, is a game I really want to play.

1703
02:19:48,597 --> 02:19:49,257
[SPEAKER_28]: I just haven't.

1704
02:19:49,497 --> 02:19:50,637
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1705
02:19:52,217 --> 02:19:54,718
[SPEAKER_24]: Loki, I'm working on acquiring it.

1706
02:19:55,393 --> 02:19:56,194
[SPEAKER_24]: I have my means.

1707
02:19:56,794 --> 02:20:09,025
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, the other thing that I should note that was posted, Jason, you know, in our chat room there, he posted a link to a port for Duke Nukem 3D for Windows.

1708
02:20:09,345 --> 02:20:10,186
[SPEAKER_24]: That's pretty sweet.

1709
02:20:11,387 --> 02:20:16,071
[SPEAKER_24]: But this Gary's Mod thing is so cool because just people, like, make the weirdest things.

1710
02:20:16,291 --> 02:20:18,133
[SPEAKER_24]: It's like they have one with a pole dancer.

1711
02:20:18,943 --> 02:20:39,254
[SPEAKER_24]: which is great, I don't even know why, it's just so funny, or this one, it's like, look ma, no hands, it's some guy riding a bike, then all of a sudden, it's just like, smacked into a tree, I mean, just like, funny shit, but this is the best part about it, is you can make like, your own webcomics, just doing little screen captures and putting stuff on there, it's genius, it's fun.

1712
02:20:40,942 --> 02:20:51,608
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, it kind of reminds me of Duke Nukem 3D, when you could make your own maps, and you could just have, like, the strippers out in the middle of the street, just doing nothing, but just sitting there on the poles, and you can blow them all away with rocket launchers.

1713
02:20:54,129 --> 02:20:57,211
[SPEAKER_24]: I've made some of the most kick-ass Duke Nukem 3D maps ever.

1714
02:20:57,251 --> 02:21:00,493
[SPEAKER_24]: I'd spend, like, months on these maps, and then...

1715
02:21:01,328 --> 02:21:15,080
[SPEAKER_24]: Literally, I'd run out of space, because in the build engine, which is the whole engine based around Duke Nukem 3D, you're given a limited amount of map that you can basically build in, and I would literally fill up everything.

1716
02:21:15,280 --> 02:21:16,822
[SPEAKER_24]: Just completely fill it up.

1717
02:21:17,302 --> 02:21:19,344
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to go back to the Skype line, because we actually got a phone call.

1718
02:21:19,384 --> 02:21:20,805
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh wait, Jamie, you have a quick comment before we go?

1719
02:21:21,710 --> 02:21:25,772
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just actually having a flashback to, on emulators, the Metroid level builder.

1720
02:21:27,113 --> 02:21:29,214
[SPEAKER_09]: A guy built his own version of Metroid.

1721
02:21:29,434 --> 02:21:31,035
[SPEAKER_28]: Metroid and the Zelda one, too?

1722
02:21:31,235 --> 02:21:31,695
[SPEAKER_28]: Great stuff.

1723
02:21:31,735 --> 02:21:33,176
[SPEAKER_28]: Man, people got too much free time.

1724
02:21:33,716 --> 02:21:34,677
[SPEAKER_28]: Get out and get a job.

1725
02:21:35,217 --> 02:21:35,698
[SPEAKER_28]: Get a real job.

1726
02:21:35,778 --> 02:21:36,398
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1727
02:21:36,738 --> 02:21:38,379
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta go to the caller, because he's hanging here.

1728
02:21:38,419 --> 02:21:39,740
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1729
02:21:40,340 --> 02:21:41,721
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on?

1730
02:21:42,181 --> 02:21:43,362
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, Big Red Pimp, what's up?

1731
02:21:43,402 --> 02:21:43,922
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind?

1732
02:21:43,962 --> 02:21:45,643
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.

1733
02:21:46,823 --> 02:21:47,424
[SPEAKER_28]: Any particular...

1734
02:21:48,024 --> 02:21:52,228
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just thinking about all that first person shooter crap you guys are talking over there.

1735
02:21:52,388 --> 02:21:54,250
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, what about the first person shooter crap?

1736
02:21:55,391 --> 02:22:00,175
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that first person shooter players just rank up there with people who post on forums.

1737
02:22:00,375 --> 02:22:01,657
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the scourge of the earth.

1738
02:22:03,038 --> 02:22:07,862
[SPEAKER_28]: Now wait a minute, you mean to tell me there is not a single first person shooter game that you kind of like?

1739
02:22:08,723 --> 02:22:11,686
[SPEAKER_00]: I have not played a first person shooter that I like since GoldenEye.

1740
02:22:12,352 --> 02:22:13,032
[SPEAKER_28]: Since Goldeneye.

1741
02:22:13,073 --> 02:22:15,094
[SPEAKER_28]: So at least there's one, okay?

1742
02:22:15,114 --> 02:22:15,354
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

1743
02:22:15,874 --> 02:22:18,516
[SPEAKER_28]: And there's not a single web forum out there you like either?

1744
02:22:19,837 --> 02:22:20,017
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

1745
02:22:20,938 --> 02:22:22,639
[SPEAKER_00]: After reading GameFAQs, forget it.

1746
02:22:23,620 --> 02:22:24,800
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, well that I could go with.

1747
02:22:25,181 --> 02:22:28,023
[SPEAKER_28]: But not even OrangeLoungeRadio.com forums?

1748
02:22:28,383 --> 02:22:29,203
[SPEAKER_28]: You make me sad.

1749
02:22:29,383 --> 02:22:30,744
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm not much of a forum whore.

1750
02:22:31,065 --> 02:22:31,385
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1751
02:22:31,445 --> 02:22:33,246
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, what do you do on the internet then?

1752
02:22:33,266 --> 02:22:40,611
[SPEAKER_28]: Because as far as I know, the internet's all about forum whore, live journal, and chat rooms pretending to be people you're not.

1753
02:22:41,360 --> 02:22:42,661
[SPEAKER_00]: You're forgetting the porn junkies.

1754
02:22:42,921 --> 02:22:43,081
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh!

1755
02:22:44,002 --> 02:22:44,322
[SPEAKER_28]: Shit!

1756
02:22:44,482 --> 02:22:46,363
[SPEAKER_28]: How could I forget the porn junkies?

1757
02:22:46,504 --> 02:22:47,664
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1758
02:22:47,764 --> 02:22:51,647
[SPEAKER_28]: So you, instead of posting on forums, you have amassed a collection of pornography?

1759
02:22:52,388 --> 02:22:52,628
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1760
02:22:53,348 --> 02:22:54,990
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

1761
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:55,630
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

1762
02:22:56,210 --> 02:22:56,410
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

1763
02:22:56,611 --> 02:22:58,052
[SPEAKER_28]: Well then what is it you do on the internet?

1764
02:22:59,293 --> 02:23:00,053
[SPEAKER_28]: Make fun of others.

1765
02:23:00,533 --> 02:23:00,894
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, okay.

1766
02:23:01,594 --> 02:23:03,876
[SPEAKER_28]: That's pretty much the same thing as what forum posters do.

1767
02:23:04,096 --> 02:23:04,756
[SPEAKER_28]: Very similar.

1768
02:23:05,677 --> 02:23:06,137
[SPEAKER_28]: Cousins.

1769
02:23:06,518 --> 02:23:06,818
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

1770
02:23:07,919 --> 02:23:09,880
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing better to do than orient anyway.

1771
02:23:10,669 --> 02:23:10,909
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1772
02:23:10,929 --> 02:23:12,451
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, ranting is for live journals.

1773
02:23:12,491 --> 02:23:16,775
[SPEAKER_28]: You should get one of those, I don't know, what, live journal or what are the other things?

1774
02:23:16,835 --> 02:23:19,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Zongas or I don't know what the hell else there is.

1775
02:23:19,618 --> 02:23:20,119
[SPEAKER_28]: Blogger.

1776
02:23:21,019 --> 02:23:22,501
[SPEAKER_00]: I rant enough in my live journal.

1777
02:23:22,901 --> 02:23:23,942
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, so you do have a live journal.

1778
02:23:23,962 --> 02:23:24,463
[SPEAKER_28]: So there you go.

1779
02:23:24,483 --> 02:23:25,364
[SPEAKER_28]: There's something for the Internet.

1780
02:23:26,024 --> 02:23:26,325
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1781
02:23:29,428 --> 02:23:29,708
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1782
02:23:29,728 --> 02:23:32,631
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything else you want to share with us, BigRedPimp, before we hang up on you?

1783
02:23:32,671 --> 02:23:33,452
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you want to plug?

1784
02:23:34,269 --> 02:23:40,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really, except for the fact that Loki, the song should not be referenced as girls because girls do not suck that badly.

1785
02:23:40,913 --> 02:23:42,213
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to end it as that.

1786
02:23:42,914 --> 02:23:45,935
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki is actually not in the room right now, but we'll relay the message to him.

1787
02:23:45,955 --> 02:23:46,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1788
02:23:47,016 --> 02:23:47,336
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1789
02:23:47,576 --> 02:23:48,116
[SPEAKER_28]: Have a good one.

1790
02:23:48,837 --> 02:23:49,257
[SPEAKER_28]: You too.

1791
02:23:49,457 --> 02:23:49,777
[SPEAKER_28]: Bye.

1792
02:23:50,738 --> 02:23:52,159
[SPEAKER_28]: Actually, I hope he heard it from the other room.

1793
02:23:52,179 --> 02:23:52,879
[SPEAKER_28]: That would be hilarious.

1794
02:23:53,339 --> 02:23:57,301
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, we'll keep the Skype line open for one more call, maybe, possibly.

1795
02:23:57,341 --> 02:23:57,762
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see.

1796
02:23:59,302 --> 02:24:00,323
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll see what happens there.

1797
02:24:03,890 --> 02:24:06,031
[SPEAKER_28]: Just reading our chat room, some random folks there.

1798
02:24:06,511 --> 02:24:08,491
[SPEAKER_28]: www.orangeonline.com, click on chat.

1799
02:24:09,072 --> 02:24:12,573
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 says, First person shooters are too much for me.

1800
02:24:12,633 --> 02:24:14,793
[SPEAKER_28]: People play that for like 15 hours straight.

1801
02:24:15,193 --> 02:24:17,094
[SPEAKER_28]: I have seen people that play that stuff for 15 hours straight.

1802
02:24:17,454 --> 02:24:20,495
[SPEAKER_28]: Me personally, I can play it a little bit.

1803
02:24:20,675 --> 02:24:24,656
[SPEAKER_28]: I like playing my friends, maybe in an hour long session on a weekend, but that's about it.

1804
02:24:24,776 --> 02:24:25,917
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't stand much more than that.

1805
02:24:26,297 --> 02:24:27,437
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're getting another call.

1806
02:24:27,497 --> 02:24:30,838
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's go back to the Skype line and say, Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1807
02:24:32,248 --> 02:24:32,888
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, it's Misty.

1808
02:24:33,208 --> 02:24:34,349
[SPEAKER_28]: Hi, Misty, how are you?

1809
02:24:35,169 --> 02:24:36,010
[SPEAKER_08]: Misty, doing good.

1810
02:24:36,850 --> 02:24:38,051
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, Misty?

1811
02:24:39,591 --> 02:24:43,533
[SPEAKER_08]: I just really wanted to say, not all the torrents are porn.

1812
02:24:44,213 --> 02:24:47,375
[SPEAKER_28]: I know not all the torrents out there are porn, but a good majority.

1813
02:24:50,196 --> 02:24:52,857
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of torrents do you like to download, then, if it's not porn?

1814
02:24:54,398 --> 02:24:54,478
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

1815
02:24:56,061 --> 02:24:57,983
[SPEAKER_08]: My main downloads are anime, of course.

1816
02:24:58,563 --> 02:25:01,245
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't been much in a torrent mood right now.

1817
02:25:02,166 --> 02:25:06,549
[SPEAKER_28]: I know, it's kind of, ever since Supernova went down, it's been kind of hard to stay on top of torrents.

1818
02:25:07,010 --> 02:25:15,156
[SPEAKER_28]: I know that one thing I'm going to end up torrenting is probably the new season of 24, which was on tonight, and I completely forgot about it, so I'm going to have to download the first episode.

1819
02:25:17,788 --> 02:25:19,749
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not really into 24 yet.

1820
02:25:20,690 --> 02:25:21,510
[SPEAKER_28]: I think it's a good show.

1821
02:25:21,871 --> 02:25:23,892
[SPEAKER_28]: I kind of missed most of last season, but I think it's a good show.

1822
02:25:24,172 --> 02:25:25,653
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of anime do you download?

1823
02:25:25,913 --> 02:25:28,435
[SPEAKER_28]: What kind of anime is good stuff out there right now on Torrent?

1824
02:25:30,076 --> 02:25:33,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Last major thing I downloaded is a series called Psychic Academy.

1825
02:25:34,719 --> 02:25:38,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't seem likely to get released in the US from what I've seen of the series.

1826
02:25:42,363 --> 02:25:44,905
[SPEAKER_24]: No, I just wanted to hold the microphone.

1827
02:25:46,079 --> 02:25:48,561
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought maybe you had a question for Misty or something.

1828
02:25:49,141 --> 02:25:51,003
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you want to plug, Misty, while you're here on the air?

1829
02:25:52,324 --> 02:25:54,105
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't really have anything to plug.

1830
02:25:54,485 --> 02:25:56,026
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, well, fair enough.

1831
02:25:56,266 --> 02:25:57,487
[SPEAKER_09]: Download the Parappa anime.

1832
02:25:58,428 --> 02:25:58,848
[SPEAKER_28]: Is that on?

1833
02:25:58,988 --> 02:26:01,450
[SPEAKER_09]: I found it on animesuki.com.

1834
02:26:03,992 --> 02:26:05,293
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, download the Parappa torrent.

1835
02:26:05,313 --> 02:26:06,293
[SPEAKER_28]: You gotta let us know what you think.

1836
02:26:07,114 --> 02:26:07,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, I will.

1837
02:26:07,895 --> 02:26:08,215
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

1838
02:26:08,435 --> 02:26:12,418
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, video game you're most looking forward to seeing in 2005?

1839
02:26:12,758 --> 02:26:13,178
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything?

1840
02:26:15,160 --> 02:26:15,440
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything?

1841
02:26:17,365 --> 02:26:20,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing I can really think of right now, but I haven't been paying much attention.

1842
02:26:21,247 --> 02:26:21,747
[SPEAKER_28]: That's alright.

1843
02:26:21,787 --> 02:26:23,528
[SPEAKER_28]: It's hard to pay attention to this show sometimes.

1844
02:26:25,288 --> 02:26:26,129
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just messing with you.

1845
02:26:26,389 --> 02:26:27,429
[SPEAKER_28]: Thanks for calling in, Misty.

1846
02:26:27,449 --> 02:26:28,350
[SPEAKER_28]: You have a wonderful week.

1847
02:26:28,970 --> 02:26:29,330
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

1848
02:26:29,490 --> 02:26:30,370
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, bye-bye.

1849
02:26:31,471 --> 02:26:32,131
[SPEAKER_28]: I like Misty.

1850
02:26:32,151 --> 02:26:32,891
[SPEAKER_28]: She's so sweet.

1851
02:26:33,352 --> 02:26:34,792
[SPEAKER_28]: She's always there for the show.

1852
02:26:34,812 --> 02:26:40,615
[SPEAKER_28]: She's always there in chat to say... When newbies come in throughout the week going, Is this Orange Louse Radio's chat room?

1853
02:26:40,895 --> 02:26:42,275
[SPEAKER_28]: Misty's always there to say something.

1854
02:26:42,315 --> 02:26:42,635
[SPEAKER_28]: Hello.

1855
02:26:42,936 --> 02:26:44,856
[SPEAKER_28]: If she's around, she'll say... No, you dumb shits.

1856
02:26:44,896 --> 02:26:45,357
[SPEAKER_09]: This is DDR.

1857
02:26:47,142 --> 02:26:48,463
[SPEAKER_28]: That's what I'm going to say in the next one.

1858
02:26:48,503 --> 02:26:49,244
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you dumb shits.

1859
02:26:49,264 --> 02:26:50,265
[SPEAKER_28]: This is DDR Freak.

1860
02:26:53,287 --> 02:26:57,311
[SPEAKER_28]: Although, ironically enough, this show is going to be played on DDR Freak Radio, so for some reason, anyway.

1861
02:26:58,031 --> 02:26:59,973
[SPEAKER_28]: It's the Bomani Sims chat room.

1862
02:27:02,295 --> 02:27:04,417
[SPEAKER_28]: This is Bomani-style chat, actually.

1863
02:27:05,898 --> 02:27:06,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Pimp my dance pad.

1864
02:27:07,539 --> 02:27:10,762
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, this is Pimp My Dance Pad, exactly.

1865
02:27:12,283 --> 02:27:12,743
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, boy.

1866
02:27:13,044 --> 02:27:13,344
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1867
02:27:14,341 --> 02:27:15,701
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it for the Skype line for now.

1868
02:27:15,741 --> 02:27:18,662
[SPEAKER_28]: We might open it up again a little bit later there, but I think three's enough for now.

1869
02:27:18,982 --> 02:27:23,904
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, we've got to get ranty.

1870
02:27:24,684 --> 02:27:26,744
[SPEAKER_28]: We're upset, and we're going to get ranty.

1871
02:27:27,645 --> 02:27:30,465
[SPEAKER_28]: In this break, we're going to feature some superstar.

1872
02:27:30,525 --> 02:27:31,726
[SPEAKER_28]: I wanted to hear... Oh, no, wait, no.

1873
02:27:31,966 --> 02:27:32,846
[SPEAKER_28]: We're not going to hear superstar.

1874
02:27:32,866 --> 02:27:37,167
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to hear Osama Kubota songs, because I promised Jamie we could hear some.

1875
02:27:38,528 --> 02:27:38,948
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1876
02:27:38,988 --> 02:27:40,248
[SPEAKER_28]: I almost forgot there for a minute.

1877
02:27:40,288 --> 02:27:43,449
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I will go postal if I don't hear Presto.

1878
02:27:43,962 --> 02:27:47,324
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we're going to queue that up so Jamie does not go postal.

1879
02:27:48,385 --> 02:27:50,366
[SPEAKER_28]: She has so many reasons to go postal, though, honestly.

1880
02:27:52,388 --> 02:27:55,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, we'll start it off with Presto, Osama Kubota music.

1881
02:27:55,490 --> 02:28:02,795
[SPEAKER_28]: We will be back with the FUs of the week, which you can send in, by the way, right now over private message to Sky if you have something you want to say after this.

1882
02:29:10,624 --> 02:29:11,529
Thanks for watching!

1883
02:30:01,355 --> 02:30:02,235
Thanks for watching!

1884
02:31:00,031 --> 02:31:00,518
Thank you.

1885
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:01,570
Thanks for watching!

1886
02:32:42,828 --> 02:32:44,009
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1887
02:33:17,626 --> 02:33:18,326
and many more.

1888
02:33:18,346 --> 02:33:18,667
Thank you.

1889
02:33:45,382 --> 02:33:46,502
Thank you for watching!

1890
02:34:23,789 --> 02:34:25,030
[SPEAKER_28]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1891
02:34:25,370 --> 02:34:32,574
[SPEAKER_28]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1892
02:34:34,735 --> 02:34:35,575
[SPEAKER_28]: Son of a bitch.

1893
02:34:35,595 --> 02:34:36,676
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to make new promos.

1894
02:34:36,716 --> 02:34:38,997
[SPEAKER_28]: We need to put that on our list of things to do.

1895
02:34:39,257 --> 02:34:39,897
[SPEAKER_28]: New promos.

1896
02:34:40,758 --> 02:34:41,458
[SPEAKER_28]: Goddamn.

1897
02:34:41,678 --> 02:34:42,599
[SPEAKER_28]: We need new promos.

1898
02:34:42,699 --> 02:34:43,319
[SPEAKER_28]: Really badly.

1899
02:34:44,742 --> 02:34:45,423
[SPEAKER_28]: Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1900
02:35:13,379 --> 02:35:14,540
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's try that again.

1901
02:35:16,481 --> 02:35:21,343
[SPEAKER_28]: Why is it that we have to do these... Rob, you are a bitch.

1902
02:35:21,423 --> 02:35:23,284
[SPEAKER_28]: Minor technical glitch there.

1903
02:35:24,044 --> 02:35:24,985
[SPEAKER_09]: You are a bitch.

1904
02:35:25,525 --> 02:35:29,807
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought we could do Switcheroo Night or something, and I'd give Loki the gay song or something.

1905
02:35:30,328 --> 02:35:30,828
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm just kidding.

1906
02:35:30,988 --> 02:35:31,268
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1907
02:35:31,468 --> 02:35:32,229
[SPEAKER_28]: No, you don't get girls.

1908
02:35:33,569 --> 02:35:33,949
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm sorry.

1909
02:35:33,989 --> 02:35:34,910
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's try that from the top.

1910
02:35:35,590 --> 02:35:36,150
[SPEAKER_28]: Rewind.

1911
02:35:36,911 --> 02:35:37,391
[SPEAKER_28]: Start over.

1912
02:35:37,471 --> 02:35:37,931
[SPEAKER_28]: Take two.

1913
02:35:38,592 --> 02:35:38,932
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie...

1914
02:35:40,273 --> 02:35:43,736
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

1915
02:35:43,896 --> 02:35:44,396
[SPEAKER_28]: Fuck you.

1916
02:35:47,879 --> 02:35:49,420
[SPEAKER_09]: My first FU was to go to Rob.

1917
02:36:01,210 --> 02:36:07,015
[SPEAKER_09]: No, my first FU of the night is just to the torrential downpour we had.

1918
02:36:08,412 --> 02:36:09,253
[SPEAKER_09]: It was pretty vicious.

1919
02:36:09,373 --> 02:36:16,919
[SPEAKER_09]: Another F you goes to the HR guy I was dealing with for basically trying to pull the same crap he pulled on one of my other co-workers.

1920
02:36:17,640 --> 02:36:26,607
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, whenever we brought up a legitimate concern, he was trying to pull the company this, and I basically turned it right back around on him because if there's one thing I'm good at, it's point and counterpoint.

1921
02:36:28,369 --> 02:36:34,854
[SPEAKER_09]: So finally, I got him to say that he was going to turn over our VP to our business partner over here, so...

1922
02:36:35,424 --> 02:36:37,406
[SPEAKER_09]: Gonna have some investigation going on.

1923
02:36:38,566 --> 02:36:45,512
[SPEAKER_09]: FU goes to the VP for always wanting to put his goddamn hand on my shoulder whenever he talks to me.

1924
02:36:45,572 --> 02:36:50,756
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm like, you know, I should have just said, you know, I would rather you not do that.

1925
02:36:50,856 --> 02:36:52,677
[SPEAKER_09]: But the whole thing is that this is a VP.

1926
02:36:53,938 --> 02:37:02,745
[SPEAKER_09]: And until I report him to HR, I don't know what's going to be used as, you know, a retaliatory action.

1927
02:37:03,165 --> 02:37:05,167
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think he's petty enough to do it.

1928
02:37:05,902 --> 02:37:09,324
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um... Yeah, Big Effie goes to him.

1929
02:37:09,424 --> 02:37:10,844
[SPEAKER_09]: He keeps begging me to stay.

1930
02:37:11,525 --> 02:37:15,847
[SPEAKER_09]: And then, on top of this, he's trying to get me to stay there through the end of the month, forcing me to stay.

1931
02:37:16,587 --> 02:37:20,989
[SPEAKER_09]: By some weird... We have to hold her to release her some type of bullshit.

1932
02:37:21,729 --> 02:37:24,611
[SPEAKER_09]: And my change date's already set with HR.

1933
02:37:24,931 --> 02:37:28,112
[SPEAKER_09]: He can't freaking do it, so I get to rub it in his face Monday.

1934
02:37:28,132 --> 02:37:28,913
[SPEAKER_09]: That's gonna be awesome.

1935
02:37:31,254 --> 02:37:34,035
[SPEAKER_09]: Um... Effie goes to, uh...

1936
02:37:34,491 --> 02:37:38,374
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I really don't have much else to F you about except for maybe my lack of time.

1937
02:37:39,075 --> 02:37:45,820
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, an F you goes toward my lack of funds and ability to travel to places that I want to go and see people I want to see.

1938
02:37:47,301 --> 02:37:50,984
[SPEAKER_09]: Other than that, I'm fairly happy because I don't have to be there anymore after this week.

1939
02:37:51,444 --> 02:37:54,227
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to look at that man after this week.

1940
02:37:54,307 --> 02:37:55,568
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be so awesome.

1941
02:37:57,449 --> 02:37:57,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

1942
02:38:01,352 --> 02:38:03,033
[SPEAKER_28]: She put the mic down, so I'm thinking she's done.

1943
02:38:03,053 --> 02:38:03,254
[SPEAKER_28]: Done.

1944
02:38:03,574 --> 02:38:03,794
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

1945
02:38:04,471 --> 02:38:05,832
[SPEAKER_28]: Loki, it's your turn.

1946
02:38:07,694 --> 02:38:12,578
[SPEAKER_24]: Uh, first off, fuck you, you stupid people.

1947
02:38:13,399 --> 02:38:16,501
[SPEAKER_24]: You can't seem to figure out how, you know, online games work.

1948
02:38:16,962 --> 02:38:21,025
[SPEAKER_24]: You don't go looking for a party if you're not your keyboard for hours at end.

1949
02:38:21,846 --> 02:38:26,790
[SPEAKER_24]: And then, like, give me a tell later on, you know, saying, oh, hi, I'm ready to party.

1950
02:38:27,010 --> 02:38:28,211
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, oh, that was half an hour ago.

1951
02:38:28,371 --> 02:38:28,872
[SPEAKER_24]: Where were you?

1952
02:38:29,392 --> 02:38:30,553
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, well, I was just taking a nap.

1953
02:38:31,714 --> 02:38:32,855
[SPEAKER_24]: What the fuck are you doing?

1954
02:38:33,286 --> 02:38:35,507
[SPEAKER_24]: Or people that do that while you're partying.

1955
02:38:36,047 --> 02:38:37,348
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh yeah, I'm going AFK for a second.

1956
02:38:38,068 --> 02:38:39,289
[SPEAKER_24]: And they're gone for half an hour.

1957
02:38:40,109 --> 02:38:40,689
[SPEAKER_24]: No, fuck that.

1958
02:38:41,630 --> 02:38:42,330
[SPEAKER_24]: That's stupid.

1959
02:38:42,370 --> 02:38:46,332
[SPEAKER_24]: If you have things that, you know, you have to do, don't play the game.

1960
02:38:47,412 --> 02:38:48,493
[SPEAKER_24]: Get the set-aside time.

1961
02:38:49,934 --> 02:38:51,314
[SPEAKER_24]: Anyways, so fuck you to that.

1962
02:38:51,594 --> 02:38:58,878
[SPEAKER_24]: Fuck you to online websites that don't really correspond with you when you order products with them.

1963
02:38:59,038 --> 02:39:00,098
[SPEAKER_24]: You just kind of have to wait.

1964
02:39:00,838 --> 02:39:01,159
[SPEAKER_24]: And wait.

1965
02:39:01,799 --> 02:39:02,099
[SPEAKER_24]: And wait.

1966
02:39:02,737 --> 02:39:05,319
[SPEAKER_24]: and hope that they sent it and didn't just take your money.

1967
02:39:07,501 --> 02:39:14,207
[SPEAKER_24]: And, um... Yeah, that's pretty much all I have right now.

1968
02:39:15,888 --> 02:39:16,508
[SPEAKER_24]: Yep, that's it.

1969
02:39:17,009 --> 02:39:18,270
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't have anything else I can think of.

1970
02:39:19,951 --> 02:39:21,793
[SPEAKER_28]: Anna, by the way, is suggesting a Warp 2.

1971
02:39:25,596 --> 02:39:26,577
[SPEAKER_24]: What?

1972
02:39:27,117 --> 02:39:28,338
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, yeah, we did do that.

1973
02:39:31,926 --> 02:39:32,286
[SPEAKER_24]: My turn.

1974
02:39:39,870 --> 02:39:42,371
[SPEAKER_28]: I would like to give a big fat F you to The Rain.

1975
02:39:43,363 --> 02:39:46,765
[SPEAKER_28]: On Thursday night, the rain was so bad.

1976
02:39:47,125 --> 02:39:51,607
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, we here on the West Coast, we're really big pussies when it comes to the rain, okay?

1977
02:39:52,267 --> 02:39:53,408
[SPEAKER_28]: If it starts... God, you are.

1978
02:39:53,608 --> 02:39:54,048
[SPEAKER_28]: Seriously.

1979
02:39:54,588 --> 02:39:58,090
[SPEAKER_28]: Like, I've been on the East Coast and I've seen how it rains back there.

1980
02:39:58,110 --> 02:39:59,790
[SPEAKER_28]: When it rains on the East Coast, it rains.

1981
02:40:00,431 --> 02:40:03,432
[SPEAKER_28]: When it rains like that here, people freak out, okay?

1982
02:40:03,452 --> 02:40:08,074
[SPEAKER_28]: But you have to remember, it's not built around here to handle rain like that.

1983
02:40:08,154 --> 02:40:08,814
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really not.

1984
02:40:09,075 --> 02:40:11,276
[SPEAKER_28]: It rains like that out here too long, it floods.

1985
02:40:11,916 --> 02:40:11,996
[SPEAKER_09]: And...

1986
02:40:12,950 --> 02:40:18,051
[SPEAKER_09]: I hate to interject on this, but Rob, you remember seeing me one of the first times I was out here for a big rain, right?

1987
02:40:18,791 --> 02:40:19,912
[SPEAKER_28]: I believe so.

1988
02:40:19,952 --> 02:40:22,572
[SPEAKER_09]: Were you just going, what the fuck, at everybody else?

1989
02:40:23,613 --> 02:40:24,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was nothing?

1990
02:40:25,653 --> 02:40:26,593
[SPEAKER_28]: But here's the problem.

1991
02:40:26,993 --> 02:40:28,914
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't have a problem with heavy rain like that.

1992
02:40:29,234 --> 02:40:40,217
[SPEAKER_28]: I have a problem when that heavy rain starts causing so much drainage to fall from the top of the roof and it's falling outside my window on the bush that it's keeping me awake and I can't freaking sleep.

1993
02:40:40,577 --> 02:40:41,077
[SPEAKER_28]: So I have to...

1994
02:40:41,815 --> 02:40:43,456
[SPEAKER_28]: Get up at 4.30 in the morning.

1995
02:40:43,516 --> 02:40:45,356
[SPEAKER_28]: No, 4 in the morning because I can't sleep.

1996
02:40:46,337 --> 02:40:49,458
[SPEAKER_28]: And I get on the computer and read about freaking DDR and Mario.

1997
02:40:50,839 --> 02:40:51,979
[SPEAKER_28]: I just, I don't know.

1998
02:40:53,700 --> 02:40:54,560
[SPEAKER_28]: I was sad.

1999
02:40:56,921 --> 02:40:58,562
[SPEAKER_28]: That's it, so I give an FU to the rain.

2000
02:40:59,827 --> 02:41:02,629
[SPEAKER_28]: Otherwise, I really don't have a lot to be pissed off about.

2001
02:41:03,569 --> 02:41:07,091
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to people that... F you to slow service at restaurants.

2002
02:41:07,152 --> 02:41:09,513
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my god, I had the slowest service the other day.

2003
02:41:09,533 --> 02:41:10,273
[SPEAKER_28]: It made me scream.

2004
02:41:10,974 --> 02:41:11,554
[SPEAKER_28]: I think that's it.

2005
02:41:12,054 --> 02:41:12,795
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm good otherwise.

2006
02:41:13,275 --> 02:41:14,496
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's hear from DDR Angel.

2007
02:41:15,517 --> 02:41:21,860
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to being sick earlier this week because I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to come to show today, but I'm here, so yay.

2008
02:41:23,161 --> 02:41:24,522
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to people that can't run a party.

2009
02:41:24,702 --> 02:41:29,265
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not supposed to have somebody that's four levels higher than you.

2010
02:41:30,049 --> 02:41:32,711
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you to Anna for stealing me away from that party.

2011
02:41:32,991 --> 02:41:34,792
[SPEAKER_10]: Good God.

2012
02:41:35,032 --> 02:41:36,393
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that sucked.

2013
02:41:37,134 --> 02:41:39,655
[SPEAKER_10]: And F you to White Mage, because oh my God.

2014
02:41:40,136 --> 02:41:41,857
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wait, Rob helped me do that.

2015
02:41:43,218 --> 02:41:43,938
[SPEAKER_10]: Go sub job.

2016
02:41:44,379 --> 02:41:45,279
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh well, I'm almost done.

2017
02:41:45,339 --> 02:41:47,421
[SPEAKER_10]: I can go back to Black Mage, so yay.

2018
02:41:48,321 --> 02:41:49,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm done.

2019
02:41:49,222 --> 02:41:49,882
[SPEAKER_10]: See, I'm boring.

2020
02:41:50,963 --> 02:41:51,223
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2021
02:41:51,624 --> 02:41:52,444
[SPEAKER_28]: I actually thought of one.

2022
02:41:52,484 --> 02:41:53,845
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh my God, Loki reminded me of one.

2023
02:41:53,865 --> 02:41:54,365
[SPEAKER_28]: I gotta go back.

2024
02:41:55,426 --> 02:41:55,986
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, go back.

2025
02:41:56,187 --> 02:41:56,547
[SPEAKER_10]: Rewind.

2026
02:41:59,588 --> 02:42:00,849
[SPEAKER_28]: That's the theme of tonight, is rewind.

2027
02:42:01,129 --> 02:42:02,110
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, here it is.

2028
02:42:03,050 --> 02:42:05,572
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

2029
02:42:06,393 --> 02:42:06,713
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie?

2030
02:42:08,114 --> 02:42:13,878
[SPEAKER_28]: We had a party yesterday in Final Fantasy XI.

2031
02:42:13,998 --> 02:42:14,878
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

2032
02:42:14,938 --> 02:42:21,563
[SPEAKER_28]: You know how in Final Fantasy XI you have Japanese and English players playing together, that's kind of the draw, you know, it's kind of cool.

2033
02:42:22,301 --> 02:42:23,502
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2034
02:42:51,764 --> 02:42:56,668
[SPEAKER_28]: OMG, JP, do they even speak American?

2035
02:42:57,328 --> 02:42:59,990
[SPEAKER_28]: I will leave unless they understand what I'm saying.

2036
02:43:00,431 --> 02:43:04,674
[SPEAKER_28]: I will not die because of some JP player who can't communicate with me.

2037
02:43:06,135 --> 02:43:09,638
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, first off, bitch, it's called English, not American.

2038
02:43:09,658 --> 02:43:10,939
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay?

2039
02:43:11,579 --> 02:43:15,962
[SPEAKER_28]: Second off, the game was designed so that Japanese and English players can play together.

2040
02:43:16,003 --> 02:43:18,544
[SPEAKER_28]: That's why you have something called the auto-translate function.

2041
02:43:18,885 --> 02:43:20,366
[SPEAKER_28]: I suggest you learn how to use it.

2042
02:43:21,502 --> 02:43:23,643
[SPEAKER_23]: Third off, you are a stupid bitch!

2043
02:43:24,484 --> 02:43:26,265
[SPEAKER_23]: Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid bitch!

2044
02:43:28,106 --> 02:43:28,707
[SPEAKER_26]: Yes, Angel.

2045
02:43:29,727 --> 02:43:31,048
[SPEAKER_10]: Angel's gonna laugh at this.

2046
02:43:31,609 --> 02:43:34,070
[SPEAKER_10]: Blizzard, bio, see ya, bye!

2047
02:43:34,090 --> 02:43:35,431
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

2048
02:43:35,851 --> 02:43:37,833
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway, that's it.

2049
02:43:37,913 --> 02:43:39,193
[SPEAKER_28]: So, Sniper Kitten, F you.

2050
02:43:39,574 --> 02:43:39,874
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2051
02:43:43,806 --> 02:44:12,414
[SPEAKER_28]: Jaded2005 moving on in the chatroom Jaded2005 would like to say F you to the postal service for not delivering my Dance Mania CD sooner Phoenix says I want to say F you Loki because he puts girls in the cage match which sucked and I would like to say F you to the creator of DDR with Mario Mario is dead and he just wants to add yeah Loki sucked tonight he must be a friend of yours or something whatever girls is going in next week

2052
02:44:14,351 --> 02:44:40,474
[SPEAKER_28]: K-Dash says F you to dumb co-workers that you wish would go away Dark Knight says F you to my arm for being in so much pain after I went go-kart racing last night and F you to myself for having a nightmare of a birthday being late for work on Thursday BRP Ohio Bomani says F you to parents and grandparents that don't give the respect to their children and grandchildren that they would expect back

2053
02:44:41,467 --> 02:44:47,239
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to Viz for holding on to Hikaru no Go anime license and not doing anything with it since they got it.

2054
02:44:47,720 --> 02:44:50,506
[SPEAKER_28]: And F you to the ice storms that hit the east coast last week.

2055
02:44:52,483 --> 02:44:57,786
[SPEAKER_28]: El Mullet says, F you to any mission in Grand Theft Auto San Andreas that involves aircraft of any kind.

2056
02:44:58,206 --> 02:45:07,370
[SPEAKER_28]: The controls are way too sensitive, causing the plane to fly in weird directions when I thought I was going straight and doing barrel rolls and slightly leaning on the analog stick the wrong way.

2057
02:45:07,731 --> 02:45:12,573
[SPEAKER_28]: Whoever was in charge of designing the plane controls must have been drunk, high, or both.

2058
02:45:14,460 --> 02:45:18,162
[SPEAKER_28]: VXJasonXV says, F you to being so freaking tired.

2059
02:45:18,222 --> 02:45:19,623
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, I'm freaking tired.

2060
02:45:20,103 --> 02:45:23,466
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to my manager for being a lying, pessimistic ass.

2061
02:45:23,966 --> 02:45:24,506
[SPEAKER_28]: Guess what?

2062
02:45:24,546 --> 02:45:26,527
[SPEAKER_28]: It's all coming around to bite you in the ass now.

2063
02:45:26,908 --> 02:45:28,268
[SPEAKER_28]: And someone important has proof.

2064
02:45:29,029 --> 02:45:29,669
[SPEAKER_28]: Sounds scandalous.

2065
02:45:30,750 --> 02:45:34,032
[SPEAKER_28]: BlackDevilerX says, F you to the idiot who wrote to El Mullet.

2066
02:45:34,092 --> 02:45:35,253
[SPEAKER_28]: He doesn't sound very bright.

2067
02:45:35,653 --> 02:45:39,575
[SPEAKER_28]: I hope El Mullet dishes out his cool logic against that guy in his next column.

2068
02:45:39,915 --> 02:45:40,676
[SPEAKER_28]: He deserves it.

2069
02:45:42,953 --> 02:45:48,437
[SPEAKER_28]: Arcadian 42, who usually is here, he says, fuck you to the cold I've had all fucking week.

2070
02:45:48,557 --> 02:45:49,057
[SPEAKER_28]: That sucks.

2071
02:45:50,058 --> 02:45:55,522
[SPEAKER_28]: Illusion says, F you to Sunflakes and Joe LaTaxi being so hard to find on Morpheus.

2072
02:45:58,084 --> 02:46:00,706
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to finals coming up and F you all the goddamn rain.

2073
02:46:02,007 --> 02:46:04,248
[SPEAKER_28]: Jamie, he's looking for Joe LaTaxi.

2074
02:46:05,869 --> 02:46:06,530
[SPEAKER_28]: Where should he look?

2075
02:46:08,022 --> 02:46:12,803
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't remember where I found it, but I'll send it to you later.

2076
02:46:12,863 --> 02:46:15,704
[SPEAKER_09]: Just shoot, I'm not even in there.

2077
02:46:16,264 --> 02:46:16,684
[SPEAKER_09]: Email me.

2078
02:46:17,585 --> 02:46:19,785
[SPEAKER_28]: Bat your eyelashes and look pretty at DarkSakura.

2079
02:46:19,825 --> 02:46:20,605
[SPEAKER_28]: Maybe she'll help you out.

2080
02:46:22,986 --> 02:46:27,507
[SPEAKER_28]: And Misty said, this isn't the best one I've ever had, but yeah, F you not having money.

2081
02:46:27,527 --> 02:46:29,008
[SPEAKER_28]: You know, that does kind of suck.

2082
02:46:29,748 --> 02:46:30,408
[SPEAKER_28]: And lastly...

2083
02:46:31,198 --> 02:46:34,319
[SPEAKER_28]: Dork says, F you to no one cooking me food.

2084
02:46:34,339 --> 02:46:36,719
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a freaking girlfriend, dammit.

2085
02:46:37,239 --> 02:46:39,340
[SPEAKER_28]: So now instead of listening to the show, I'm cooking.

2086
02:46:39,480 --> 02:46:40,480
[SPEAKER_28]: Boo freaking hoo.

2087
02:46:42,940 --> 02:46:43,581
[SPEAKER_28]: I like that.

2088
02:46:43,781 --> 02:46:46,841
[SPEAKER_28]: I like how he says, F you to no one cooking me food.

2089
02:46:46,961 --> 02:46:48,222
[SPEAKER_28]: I need a freaking girlfriend.

2090
02:46:49,782 --> 02:46:51,342
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, and Anna Kitty has one too.

2091
02:46:51,362 --> 02:46:54,063
[SPEAKER_28]: F you to the lag I get while trying to listen to Orange Launch Radio.

2092
02:46:54,423 --> 02:46:57,043
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the boyfriend, or actually husband, right?

2093
02:46:57,503 --> 02:46:57,964
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

2094
02:46:58,024 --> 02:46:58,544
[SPEAKER_28]: Is it husband?

2095
02:46:59,644 --> 02:47:00,124
[SPEAKER_28]: Fiancee?

2096
02:47:00,894 --> 02:47:01,514
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't remember.

2097
02:47:01,795 --> 02:47:03,636
[SPEAKER_28]: Just tell him to quit playing Final Fantasy XI.

2098
02:47:03,796 --> 02:47:05,056
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the other guy in your house.

2099
02:47:06,077 --> 02:47:06,898
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll call him that.

2100
02:47:07,378 --> 02:47:08,959
[SPEAKER_28]: Tell the guy in your house to quit playing it.

2101
02:47:10,760 --> 02:47:11,200
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2102
02:47:13,401 --> 02:47:13,942
[SPEAKER_28]: There you have it.

2103
02:47:15,623 --> 02:47:21,746
[SPEAKER_28]: Again, you can email the lovely DarkSakura by emailing jamie at orangelawnsradio.com and it will forward to her usual address.

2104
02:47:22,567 --> 02:47:22,987
[SPEAKER_28]: Yes, it will.

2105
02:47:23,407 --> 02:47:24,588
[SPEAKER_28]: I verified it was set up this week.

2106
02:47:26,529 --> 02:47:27,589
[SPEAKER_28]: Unless you want to give your other one.

2107
02:47:28,110 --> 02:47:28,410
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't care.

2108
02:47:30,607 --> 02:47:40,712
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, actually, you can either do it there or, um, this one time only I'm going to give, um, an email I can check from work.

2109
02:47:41,773 --> 02:47:46,775
[SPEAKER_09]: It's, uh, DarkSakura at DelBiter, D-E-L-B-I-T-E-R dot com.

2110
02:47:47,515 --> 02:47:49,036
[SPEAKER_09]: This is the only time I'm giving this one out.

2111
02:47:49,736 --> 02:47:50,417
[SPEAKER_28]: Ooh, okay.

2112
02:47:51,477 --> 02:47:53,218
[SPEAKER_28]: Quick, stalker fans, write that down.

2113
02:47:54,519 --> 02:47:54,759
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2114
02:47:55,939 --> 02:47:58,261
[SPEAKER_28]: Anna did verify that yes, it is indeed husband.

2115
02:47:58,301 --> 02:47:59,181
[SPEAKER_28]: My bad, my bad.

2116
02:48:00,100 --> 02:48:00,620
[SPEAKER_28]: What can I do?

2117
02:48:04,223 --> 02:48:05,884
[SPEAKER_28]: I like the other guy that lives in your house.

2118
02:48:05,924 --> 02:48:07,184
[SPEAKER_28]: Come on, you have to admit, that was a good one.

2119
02:48:08,405 --> 02:48:08,725
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2120
02:48:09,926 --> 02:48:16,050
[SPEAKER_28]: I got a file from DJ Ranma S, who was so kind to find this file for me.

2121
02:48:16,490 --> 02:48:19,952
[SPEAKER_28]: Remember earlier when we were talking about DDR featuring Mario?

2122
02:48:20,873 --> 02:48:24,035
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, here's another song that needs to be in the game.

2123
02:48:27,993 --> 02:48:29,035
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

2124
02:48:29,055 --> 02:48:33,322
[SPEAKER_20]: Swing your arms from side to side, come on, it's time to go!

2125
02:48:33,362 --> 02:48:34,424
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

2126
02:48:34,484 --> 02:48:38,731
[SPEAKER_20]: Take one step, and then again, let's do the Mario!

2127
02:48:38,851 --> 02:48:39,872
[SPEAKER_20]: All together now!

2128
02:48:44,247 --> 02:48:45,327
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the Mario!

2129
02:48:46,948 --> 02:48:47,968
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

2130
02:48:48,008 --> 02:48:50,629
[SPEAKER_20]: Swing your arms from side to side.

2131
02:48:50,689 --> 02:48:52,249
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on, it's time to go!

2132
02:48:52,289 --> 02:48:53,350
[SPEAKER_20]: Do the Mario!

2133
02:48:53,430 --> 02:48:55,990
[SPEAKER_20]: Take one step, and then again.

2134
02:48:56,050 --> 02:48:58,891
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do the Mario all together now!

2135
02:49:00,532 --> 02:49:03,513
[SPEAKER_20]: Come on now, just like that!

2136
02:49:05,013 --> 02:49:07,094
[SPEAKER_28]: Just like that!

2137
02:49:07,414 --> 02:49:10,215
[SPEAKER_28]: He sounds like a cross between Cookie Monster and Cat and Lou.

2138
02:49:10,335 --> 02:49:11,495
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh god, he was awesome.

2139
02:49:11,880 --> 02:49:17,984
[SPEAKER_09]: And he was Cyndi Lauper's dad in the videos.

2140
02:49:18,004 --> 02:49:18,484
[SPEAKER_28]: The 80s.

2141
02:49:21,006 --> 02:49:21,406
[SPEAKER_28]: Anyway.

2142
02:49:23,907 --> 02:49:28,931
[SPEAKER_28]: It's so funny looking at the chat room and some people that freaking hate that song and some people that really love it.

2143
02:49:30,652 --> 02:49:32,233
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, I like how El Mullet puts it.

2144
02:49:32,553 --> 02:49:35,114
[SPEAKER_28]: Cookie, cookie, I'm not doing the Mario!

2145
02:49:38,877 --> 02:49:39,317
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2146
02:49:40,257 --> 02:49:40,878
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to...

2147
02:49:42,599 --> 02:49:46,202
[SPEAKER_28]: If I didn't read your FU, I didn't get one, so resend it, I guess.

2148
02:49:46,562 --> 02:49:48,584
[SPEAKER_28]: So we'll read those when we come back.

2149
02:49:49,945 --> 02:49:51,606
[SPEAKER_28]: In the meantime, we're going to do one more break.

2150
02:49:51,626 --> 02:49:55,789
[SPEAKER_28]: We're going to do a quick break, a couple songs, and then we're going to come back and wrap up the show.

2151
02:49:55,949 --> 02:49:57,810
[SPEAKER_28]: That's right, it's time to wrap up the show.

2152
02:49:58,591 --> 02:50:01,073
[SPEAKER_28]: So I thought I'd play something a little up-tempo for you guys.

2153
02:50:01,153 --> 02:50:06,016
[SPEAKER_28]: I thought we'd play a little bit of something from Guitar Freaks, and then we'll come back and get ready to wrap up the show.

2154
02:50:06,277 --> 02:50:06,677
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll be back.

2155
02:51:22,434 --> 02:51:23,235
It's great, man.

2156
02:52:53,950 --> 02:52:56,371
Listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

2157
02:52:56,411 --> 02:53:00,253
Because Bongo demands it.

2158
02:53:18,191 --> 02:53:18,671
[SPEAKER_28]: You know what?

2159
02:53:18,711 --> 02:53:21,993
[SPEAKER_28]: I think our chat room tonight has turned into Jamie's personal hell.

2160
02:53:22,353 --> 02:53:25,594
[SPEAKER_28]: Because, like, everybody from our Final Fantasy XI link shell is coming in.

2161
02:53:26,755 --> 02:53:28,496
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't call it my own personal hell, you know.

2162
02:53:28,516 --> 02:53:33,878
[SPEAKER_09]: I wouldn't have had a problem with Final Fantasy XI had I received the support I needed.

2163
02:53:36,019 --> 02:53:36,739
[SPEAKER_25]: It's a tough game.

2164
02:53:37,039 --> 02:53:37,460
[SPEAKER_25]: It's tough.

2165
02:53:37,940 --> 02:53:38,980
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not saying it was tough.

2166
02:53:39,160 --> 02:53:42,082
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just, you know, on Ragnarok, there were always people playing.

2167
02:53:43,802 --> 02:53:46,924
[SPEAKER_09]: I could easily go and level completely by myself.

2168
02:53:48,294 --> 02:53:54,918
[SPEAKER_09]: But anytime I ever came on and asked for help, sorry, we're busy doing some dumbass crap.

2169
02:53:54,958 --> 02:53:55,538
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, I tried.

2170
02:53:55,778 --> 02:53:56,278
[SPEAKER_25]: I tried.

2171
02:53:58,319 --> 02:53:59,120
[SPEAKER_09]: So I said forget it.

2172
02:54:01,401 --> 02:54:01,841
[SPEAKER_28]: Let's see.

2173
02:54:02,922 --> 02:54:03,822
[SPEAKER_28]: What else was I going to say?

2174
02:54:04,243 --> 02:54:04,643
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2175
02:54:04,703 --> 02:54:06,043
[SPEAKER_28]: I had something else I was going to say.

2176
02:54:06,144 --> 02:54:08,045
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, I wanted to do some late FUs that came in.

2177
02:54:10,240 --> 02:54:17,062
[SPEAKER_28]: MPQ had some FUs he was trying to send me, but MIRC sucks for some reason, so FU to MIRC, says MPQ.

2178
02:54:17,563 --> 02:54:20,123
[SPEAKER_28]: But he says, here's the in a nutshell version of it.

2179
02:54:20,544 --> 02:54:26,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Illusions never fixes their babani, smokers poison me, and Bill Masterman doesn't know much about how 2DX actually costs.

2180
02:54:26,506 --> 02:54:27,426
[SPEAKER_28]: Those are all his FUs.

2181
02:54:31,587 --> 02:54:32,888
[SPEAKER_28]: And let's see, what was last here?

2182
02:54:33,228 --> 02:54:37,009
[SPEAKER_28]: DJ Ranma S says, I'm putting in my FU still late, I don't care.

2183
02:54:37,309 --> 02:54:39,450
[SPEAKER_28]: FU to people returning iPods that work.

2184
02:54:40,936 --> 02:54:43,038
[SPEAKER_28]: You retards, and F you to my computer for crashing.

2185
02:54:45,400 --> 02:54:45,780
[SPEAKER_28]: All right.

2186
02:54:47,462 --> 02:54:47,762
[SPEAKER_28]: Wow.

2187
02:54:48,142 --> 02:54:48,643
[SPEAKER_28]: Where'd it go?

2188
02:54:49,203 --> 02:54:50,404
[SPEAKER_28]: We're just about done with the show here.

2189
02:54:50,745 --> 02:54:55,189
[SPEAKER_28]: Any other Bomani news that you can think of that went on this week that I'm completely missing?

2190
02:54:55,229 --> 02:54:56,029
[SPEAKER_28]: I can't think of anything.

2191
02:54:56,069 --> 02:54:57,971
[SPEAKER_28]: You've been reading the boards, though, Loki.

2192
02:54:57,991 --> 02:54:58,712
[SPEAKER_28]: Anything you can think of?

2193
02:55:01,814 --> 02:55:01,994
[SPEAKER_28]: No.

2194
02:55:03,396 --> 02:55:03,956
[SPEAKER_24]: Nothing really.

2195
02:55:04,096 --> 02:55:07,079
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I've been paying more attention to building my computer.

2196
02:55:07,588 --> 02:55:08,348
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2197
02:55:30,642 --> 02:55:33,103
[SPEAKER_24]: All the people that used to make good sim files stopped doing it.

2198
02:55:33,183 --> 02:55:44,085
[SPEAKER_24]: It's just like, it's going to be a whole new resurgence of, you know, I guess before, I mean, it wasn't exactly, he wasn't exactly good or anything, but, you know, there was, you know, Bomani Ruler, and everyone was like, oh, I've got to get that stuff.

2199
02:55:44,845 --> 02:55:45,506
[SPEAKER_24]: No, then he left.

2200
02:55:45,806 --> 02:55:48,626
[SPEAKER_24]: And then it was UtterDude, and then everyone was like, oh, I've got to get his stuff.

2201
02:55:48,886 --> 02:55:49,427
[SPEAKER_24]: Then he's gone.

2202
02:55:49,907 --> 02:55:55,468
[SPEAKER_24]: And now there's new people stepping in to take their place, and so it's just the whole thing all over again.

2203
02:55:56,048 --> 02:56:05,715
[SPEAKER_24]: But, um, really, I think the problem is, is because DDR Maniacs is down, and so you don't have any, like, Step Mania updates, that's where all your theme stuff was, everything.

2204
02:56:05,815 --> 02:56:12,159
[SPEAKER_24]: So, that's probably why you're missing out on that stuff, and DDR UK is just not quite up to, you know, that stuff.

2205
02:56:12,199 --> 02:56:17,243
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, they're working hard on those official sim files, so that'll be fun once that comes out, but, um...

2206
02:56:18,936 --> 02:56:19,797
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2207
02:56:34,626 --> 02:56:43,915
[SPEAKER_24]: I've thought of some other things, but I don't want to commit to anything because I hate starting projects after I haven't finished other projects.

2208
02:56:45,276 --> 02:56:45,677
[SPEAKER_24]: We'll see.

2209
02:56:46,037 --> 02:56:46,377
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

2210
02:56:47,458 --> 02:56:48,900
[SPEAKER_24]: No news until there is news, I guess.

2211
02:56:51,402 --> 02:56:56,146
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping the rumors are true that there's going to be some type of new DDR game this year.

2212
02:56:56,166 --> 02:56:57,968
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, besides the Europe thing we already heard about.

2213
02:56:58,008 --> 02:56:58,969
[SPEAKER_28]: I mean, obviously there's that.

2214
02:56:59,650 --> 02:57:01,173
[SPEAKER_24]: How about that pretty soon, actually?

2215
02:57:01,493 --> 02:57:04,479
[SPEAKER_24]: That should be by the end of next week?

2216
02:57:05,228 --> 02:57:09,952
[SPEAKER_28]: I'm hoping it's a sign of things to come from not only Japan, but the US as well.

2217
02:57:10,593 --> 02:57:11,454
[SPEAKER_28]: At least something.

2218
02:57:11,714 --> 02:57:12,675
[SPEAKER_28]: It's been too long.

2219
02:57:12,735 --> 02:57:14,376
[SPEAKER_28]: DDR Extreme, we've been sitting on it too long.

2220
02:57:14,396 --> 02:57:15,237
[SPEAKER_28]: We need something new.

2221
02:57:15,877 --> 02:57:17,179
[SPEAKER_28]: We're foaming at the mouth here, people.

2222
02:57:17,199 --> 02:57:17,939
[SPEAKER_28]: We need something new.

2223
02:57:18,640 --> 02:57:21,142
[SPEAKER_28]: Otherwise, people are going to have to start importing machines from Europe.

2224
02:57:21,182 --> 02:57:21,843
[SPEAKER_24]: What's with that?

2225
02:57:22,583 --> 02:57:24,425
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, here is, I think, what the problem was before.

2226
02:57:24,445 --> 02:57:27,428
[SPEAKER_24]: It wasn't a matter of, you know, oh, we just don't want to release another mix.

2227
02:57:27,908 --> 02:57:32,172
[SPEAKER_24]: It was they hit the limits of their previous mix, and they had to develop something.

2228
02:57:32,987 --> 02:57:40,130
[SPEAKER_24]: Kind of like, I'm not really sure with 9th style and 8th style if there was a lull between those, but it's like that.

2229
02:57:40,170 --> 02:57:43,452
[SPEAKER_24]: They just have to, you know, they have to kind of redesign everything from the ground up.

2230
02:57:43,612 --> 02:57:46,553
[SPEAKER_24]: That's why probably having gotten anything.

2231
02:57:46,573 --> 02:57:55,437
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, since, you know, their arcade division kind of fizzled out, you know, you have to design the hardware for it, and it's a little more difficult than just throwing a PC in there.

2232
02:57:55,698 --> 02:57:57,478
[SPEAKER_24]: So, I don't know.

2233
02:57:57,859 --> 02:57:58,839
[SPEAKER_24]: That's the only thing I can think of.

2234
02:58:00,305 --> 02:58:05,731
[SPEAKER_28]: DarkLionXVI sent me this link, and I thought we had talked about this on a previous show, but maybe we missed it.

2235
02:58:05,771 --> 02:58:06,252
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't remember.

2236
02:58:06,312 --> 02:58:07,633
[SPEAKER_28]: I think we brought it up briefly.

2237
02:58:07,914 --> 02:58:10,717
[SPEAKER_28]: But the website has been updated here and there a little bit.

2238
02:58:10,997 --> 02:58:14,701
[SPEAKER_28]: It's Karaoke Revolution Bamani Edition, and this is coming out in Japan.

2239
02:58:15,102 --> 02:58:18,065
[SPEAKER_28]: And you can sing to poppin' music hits and things like that.

2240
02:58:18,946 --> 02:58:22,207
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know if there is new stuff that they're putting in here.

2241
02:58:22,287 --> 02:58:23,947
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like there might be a few new songs in here.

2242
02:58:24,327 --> 02:58:29,248
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, because I don't think like Mobomogo was in there before and KCK and songs like that.

2243
02:58:30,628 --> 02:58:33,149
[SPEAKER_28]: Looks like some new Desro songs are going to be put in there.

2244
02:58:33,909 --> 02:58:37,869
[SPEAKER_28]: Very interesting, these songs that they've decided to put in Karaoke Revolution Bomani.

2245
02:58:38,770 --> 02:58:41,430
[SPEAKER_28]: One thing I noticed on the site, is that I might rave on there?

2246
02:58:41,470 --> 02:58:42,330
[SPEAKER_28]: You've got to be kidding me.

2247
02:58:43,350 --> 02:58:45,191
[SPEAKER_28]: Oh, Loki says that would be cool though.

2248
02:58:45,231 --> 02:58:46,231
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't think I see it on there.

2249
02:58:47,048 --> 02:58:49,710
[SPEAKER_28]: Just a lot of poppin' music type songs are in there.

2250
02:58:50,170 --> 02:58:50,891
[SPEAKER_28]: Not just that, though.

2251
02:58:50,931 --> 02:58:53,733
[SPEAKER_28]: You can check out the website over at KonamiStyle.com.

2252
02:58:54,133 --> 02:58:58,756
[SPEAKER_28]: You notice, though, that Karaoke Revolution in Japan looks a lot different.

2253
02:58:59,236 --> 02:59:04,580
[SPEAKER_28]: It's not the whole person singing on the stage thing or anything like that.

2254
02:59:04,700 --> 02:59:07,562
[SPEAKER_28]: It looks like basically a karaoke machine would.

2255
02:59:08,311 --> 02:59:10,153
[SPEAKER_28]: Kind of not quite as flashy, I don't know.

2256
02:59:10,213 --> 02:59:10,953
[SPEAKER_28]: Or maybe it is flashy.

2257
02:59:10,973 --> 02:59:12,374
[SPEAKER_28]: I've got to see this game in motion, really.

2258
02:59:12,414 --> 02:59:15,397
[SPEAKER_28]: But it doesn't look anything like Karaoke Revolution USA.

2259
02:59:15,777 --> 02:59:21,182
[SPEAKER_28]: But if you like to sing, you can get on that.

2260
02:59:21,302 --> 02:59:21,602
[SPEAKER_28]: I don't know.

2261
02:59:22,503 --> 02:59:27,107
[SPEAKER_24]: They should port over their DDR karaoke mix.

2262
02:59:27,267 --> 02:59:37,215
[SPEAKER_24]: Another thing that came out recently, which I have to actually update on our game here, is Karaoke Revolution 3, which we have.

2263
02:59:37,877 --> 02:59:41,259
[SPEAKER_24]: Um, cheat codes came out, so we can unlock all the songs, including Snake Eater.

2264
02:59:42,140 --> 02:59:42,840
[SPEAKER_26]: Alright!

2265
02:59:42,941 --> 02:59:45,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Snake Eater is the most ridiculous damn song in that game!

2266
02:59:46,123 --> 02:59:47,984
[SPEAKER_09]: You can feast on a tree frog.

2267
02:59:49,565 --> 02:59:50,626
[SPEAKER_09]: Best lyrics ever.

2268
02:59:52,087 --> 02:59:55,349
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, and, um, I hate Metal Gear Solid 3, cause...

2269
02:59:56,862 --> 03:00:03,707
[SPEAKER_24]: Us nerds were not meant to be in the jungle, therefore putting us in the jungle does not work.

2270
03:00:04,207 --> 03:00:07,149
[SPEAKER_24]: I went into the jungle and I knew nothing of what I was doing.

2271
03:00:07,209 --> 03:00:08,910
[SPEAKER_24]: I was like, oh my god, I'm gonna die.

2272
03:00:08,930 --> 03:00:11,412
[SPEAKER_09]: You're supposed to feast on a tree frog.

2273
03:00:11,692 --> 03:00:15,955
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, an alligator feasted on me, so yeah.

2274
03:00:16,415 --> 03:00:17,256
[SPEAKER_24]: That was the end of that.

2275
03:00:18,857 --> 03:00:20,678
[SPEAKER_24]: Because my fucking cheat codes wouldn't work.

2276
03:00:20,718 --> 03:00:23,100
[SPEAKER_24]: I wanted to Rambo my way through it, but it wouldn't let me.

2277
03:00:24,001 --> 03:00:24,641
[SPEAKER_24]: Those bastards.

2278
03:00:27,580 --> 03:00:30,422
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, it's getting down towards the end of the show, guys.

2279
03:00:30,442 --> 03:00:31,223
[SPEAKER_28]: We've got to wrap it up.

2280
03:00:32,084 --> 03:00:32,784
[SPEAKER_28]: Final thoughts.

2281
03:00:33,025 --> 03:00:33,985
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll start off with Angel.

2282
03:00:34,106 --> 03:00:34,706
[SPEAKER_28]: Your final thought.

2283
03:00:37,428 --> 03:00:39,410
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to go play Final Fantasy XI again.

2284
03:00:39,730 --> 03:00:40,151
[SPEAKER_10]: Addict.

2285
03:00:40,451 --> 03:00:41,191
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, wait a minute.

2286
03:00:41,232 --> 03:00:42,493
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the one who's going to meet me tonight.

2287
03:00:44,734 --> 03:00:45,675
[SPEAKER_24]: Final thought, Loki.

2288
03:00:46,796 --> 03:00:48,237
[SPEAKER_24]: I hope more of my computer stuff comes in.

2289
03:00:48,297 --> 03:00:50,059
[SPEAKER_24]: Actually, I hope all of it comes in this week.

2290
03:00:50,643 --> 03:00:51,904
[SPEAKER_24]: DarkSakura, your final thought?

2291
03:00:51,924 --> 03:00:52,625
[SPEAKER_24]: I freaking hate IRC.

2292
03:00:52,645 --> 03:00:56,247
[SPEAKER_24]: And my final thought is please tune in to Orange Launch Radio's other programming throughout the week.

2293
03:01:19,232 --> 03:01:23,436
[SPEAKER_28]: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday even, and then Friday over on DDR Freak.

2294
03:01:23,476 --> 03:01:24,037
[SPEAKER_28]: Listen to it!

2295
03:01:25,378 --> 03:01:25,919
[SPEAKER_28]: Or I'll cry.

2296
03:01:27,320 --> 03:01:28,722
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, um, that's it.

2297
03:01:29,362 --> 03:01:34,067
[SPEAKER_28]: The final word of tonight's show, one word to sum up everything.

2298
03:01:35,589 --> 03:01:37,451
[SPEAKER_28]: Nellie, do you want, oh, you want it, Jamie?

2299
03:01:37,791 --> 03:01:38,992
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright, Jamie, what's the final word?

2300
03:01:40,414 --> 03:01:40,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Addict.

2301
03:01:41,844 --> 03:01:46,689
[SPEAKER_03]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2302
03:01:47,530 --> 03:01:51,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

2303
03:01:52,235 --> 03:01:59,982
[SPEAKER_03]: For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

2304
03:02:00,543 --> 03:02:04,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2305
03:02:34,225 --> 03:02:35,531
Thanks for watching!

2306
03:03:06,468 --> 03:03:07,449
Thanks for watching!

2307
03:03:41,760 --> 03:03:43,081
Thanks for watching!

2308
03:04:12,777 --> 03:04:13,798
Thank you for watching!

2309
03:04:51,630 --> 03:04:55,142
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2310
03:05:15,792 --> 03:05:19,096
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright guys, we're back here, Orange Lounge Radio.

2311
03:05:19,616 --> 03:05:35,271
[SPEAKER_28]: As a reminder, because I know a lot of you guys were off for the past couple weeks, we are phasing out the afterbirth segment of the show, just because we have other things we have to take care of after the show is now, so the afterbirths aren't going to be around a whole lot longer, and plus there will be no more post-show.

2312
03:05:36,092 --> 03:05:40,076
[SPEAKER_28]: We'll go right back into the Bomani Music & More program featuring all your favorite DDR bands,

2313
03:05:41,677 --> 03:05:47,882
[SPEAKER_28]: I know you guys might be sad about the loss of the afterbirth, but remember, this is how we bring you these other projects that we're doing, like the podcast and things like that.

2314
03:05:47,902 --> 03:05:48,563
[SPEAKER_28]: So don't cry!

2315
03:05:49,103 --> 03:05:50,264
[SPEAKER_28]: Don't cry for me, Argentina!

2316
03:05:50,924 --> 03:05:51,205
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2317
03:05:52,626 --> 03:05:53,466
[SPEAKER_28]: Did you just think that?

2318
03:05:53,947 --> 03:05:54,387
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2319
03:05:54,567 --> 03:05:56,629
[SPEAKER_28]: Nellie's finally saying something, even though the show's over.

2320
03:05:57,269 --> 03:05:57,509
[SPEAKER_28]: What?

2321
03:05:58,110 --> 03:05:58,550
[SPEAKER_28]: Exactly.

2322
03:05:59,011 --> 03:05:59,351
[SPEAKER_28]: Alright.

2323
03:06:00,612 --> 03:06:01,272
[SPEAKER_28]: So that's it.

2324
03:06:01,793 --> 03:06:05,876
[SPEAKER_28]: We're now going to go back to Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and
