10685	15028	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
16009	21273	Hello everybody and welcome to the very first Orange Lounge Radio Podcast.
21754	24676	I'm your host, Rob Roberts, along with my other host.
25497	28319	I'm DarkSakura, the great and terrible.
29751	52801	and then of course we have one more host you guys have all come to know and love and I'm hungry no I'm Loki alright so Orange Lounge Radio this is going to be the first edition of our podcast so what is this all about the Orange Lounge Radio podcast the idea behind this is this great new technology that's out there on the internet that's basically you can kind of think of it as an audio blog
53419	55160	But it's something that you can subscribe to.
55260	59261	So if you're hearing this, you've figured out via our website how to subscribe to our podcast.
59701	63162	And now what you're going to be able to do is that you stay subscribed to our podcast.
63482	67323	And about every week or so, you're going to get a brand new episode of Orange Lounge Radio.
67643	72505	And this is not just rehashed, re-edited stuff that's on our normal three-hour live talk program.
72525	79647	This is an all-new program that's made specifically for you to take with you in your pocket everywhere you go.
80687	82468	Just promise to treat us gently.
83035	84056	Orange Lounge Radio
102210	102970	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
131864	144354	Beatmania, then we had Dance Dance Revolution, that's the one you guys have all heard about, certainly, and then we have other games that came out in that series, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, Para Para Paradise, all these types of games, right?
145094	150498	And then in the meantime, other folks notice what Konami's doing, and they come out with their own music games that are pretty good.
150538	159445	You've got Amplitude, you've got Frequency, and then you've got Donkey Konga, Taiko Drum Master now, and then of course you had the granddaddies of them all,
159810	164973	The very first games we saw like this, one of your favorites, right Jamie?
165233	166393	Yeah, my Busta Move.
166733	167374	Busta Move.
167774	172316	Now, you get annoyed when people call this Busta Groove though, right?
172616	181761	Yes, because Busta Move, the only reason why it's Busta Groove over here is because Taito has Busta Move licensed for Puzzle Bobble.
182261	185203	Which Puzzle Bobble is a lot cuter name for the little bubble game.
185443	187664	Because it was Bubble Bobble and you had Puzzle Bobble.
188419	189060	Bust a move.
189400	191102	I'm sorry, how do you bust a groove?
191882	192303	What do you do?
192343	195386	Just like fill it with something and then hit it with a jackhammer?
195626	195986	I don't know.
197608	198829	How can you serve someone?
198849	201472	I mean, it's just in the same category right there.
201492	202493	It doesn't make any sense.
203334	203634	Whatever.
204778	209642	All right, so of course we have this love for music video games because it's how we all kind of came together.
209682	222111	Because you'll notice, if you visit huge websites dedicated to these games out there, things such as DDRFreak.com, things such as BomaniStyle, DDRSpot, and of course OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you notice that there's quite a little following to these games.
222511	224853	However, OrangeLaunchRadio, we kind of want to expand.
224913	225654	We noticed that...
226434	233457	Video gaming, while it's addressed out there in the internet radio world, it's just not covered quite the way we think we can do it.
233517	237658	So we like to call ourselves also Video Game News About Games That Don't Suck.
239319	242740	Which sometimes get fewer and fewer.
243080	243761	You'd be surprised.
243801	246722	So there's just so many great new games out there we want to talk about as well.
246982	247502	And you know what?
247982	251744	Even when a game sometimes does suck, we've got to let you know about it so that you don't buy it.
251924	252164	Yeah.
253288	253688	Like Driver 3.
274139	293352	and what they're talking about is that Konami is going to showcase over at the Consumer Electronics Show 2005 and Konami is going to actually feature Dance Dance Revolution at the show from January 6th through the 9th and they're going to be doing this thing called the Cardio Play Zone so now of course the Consumer Electronics Show this is something that takes place in America
293892	304314	They're probably going to be selling games such as, you know, well, I mean, not literally selling there at the show, but they're going to be pushing games such as DDR Ultramix 2, DDR Extreme, things that came out this year.
304714	309795	But what a really good time to be pushing this Get Fit envelope right at the beginning of the year, huh?
309935	313236	Because everyone's going to be making their New Year's resolutions.
313776	318256	And, of course, everyone's going to get in a big frenzy to buy it right there at the beginning of the year.
318356	321117	So even if they lose their momentum later on, they've already made the purchase.
323044	323404	Exactly.
323664	326786	And now you are somebody that actually goes to a gym on a regular basis.
326846	327366	Yes.
327486	331008	You play DDR for a workout sometimes, but you get your real workout at the gym, right?
331628	334809	Tell me about what happens in January versus what happens in June.
335290	338991	The gym fills up with so many stupid people.
339312	343333	Like, we're going to work out five million days a week, and we're going to get fit.
343353	346115	And then, of course, a month later, it's back to business as usual.
346215	348856	Maybe a couple of them will stay, but, you know...
349611	358337	That's why for anyone, I say if anyone's ever going to make that resolution to get fit, start light because you will burn yourself out like just about all those other people do at the gym.
359318	359838	Absolutely.
360578	370185	And if you're going to play DDR to get fit, you know, we've talked a lot about on our three-hour program, we've talked a lot about how, you know, folks use DDR in their diet and things like that.
370505	372487	Just remember to stick with it, okay?
372507	374208	If you're going to play, play on a
376523	377703	I'm speaking from experience here.
378223	380564	If you stop playing for a while, you lose it.
380724	384365	It's not just the skill you lose, but you lose your stamina, and it sucks.
385225	386705	Oh yeah, I can attest to that.
386905	393647	See, right now I'm working on the first stage of our coverage of the aerobic aspects of DDR.
393987	396167	I'm working on the fattening up stage, okay?
396527	398588	And then we'll get into actual gameplay.
398728	404129	I can't say when, but at some point we'll start playing again, or at least I'll start playing again, and
405371	405832	All right.
415747	418589	Also, what I want to talk about is going on in Bomani News right now.
418629	420591	This has to do with DDR Ultramix 2.
421671	423913	Awesome mix that's out there for the Xbox.
424374	431359	They partnered up with a different drum.com, the label there, and just gave a whole new style of music to it.
431679	437184	Well, through the DDR Freak forums, we actually know some of the new songs that are going to be in Downloadable Song Pack 8.
437824	439326	So you guys can look forward to these songs.
439726	442508	We have Cosmic Cowgirls going to be in Song Pack 8.
442768	444069	That was the song that was in Guitar Freaks.
444089	444690	You remember that song?
447431	448451	I love that song.
448511	448832	Exactly.
448852	450252	That was my drum mania song.
450312	450972	Cosmic Cowgirl.
451573	453153	We have a remix of Kind Lady.
453173	457835	We don't know exactly what the remix title is yet, but there will be a remix of Kind Lady in the song pack.
458336	461477	Another remix of In My Eyes is going to be happening as well.
461997	466519	And the Togo Project featuring Sana, More Deep, version 2.1.
466919	471622	This song, you might remember, was a hidden song in Max 2 USA, so now it's going to cross over to the Xbox.
472102	474063	And this is a really interesting one, I thought.
474723	474803	Uh,
475936	482458	If I can even pronounce this right, it's a song from Guitar Freak 6th and Drum Mania 5th, and it's crossing over into DDR.
482518	485239	It's Balalakia, Carried with the Wind.
486380	486960	You know this one?
487020	489020	It's kind of an interesting one.
489441	489741	All right.
490181	495843	If you want to hear those songs in their entirety, we'll be playing them on Orange Lounge Radio at some point a little bit of a later date.
496243	496483	All right.
497683	505346	Now, as you know, on Orange Lounge Radio, the program which we have Sunday night, 630 Pacific Standard Time, we have this little segment we like to do called the FUs of the Week.
506431	511733	Well, what we've decided to do for this portable version is, you know, Jamie still has a little bit of anger.
512574	513014	Maybe a little bit.
513054	514295	Oh, the pain, the anger.
514315	516956	But she's going to use that anger for the forces of good.
518696	520977	And she's going to have her own... Is that what they're calling it now?
521037	522198	Yes, that's what they're calling it now.
522498	524939	So now she's going to have her advice column.
524979	528161	So, Jamie, if you would, please tell us your advice column for this week.
528881	533243	My first piece of advice for this first podcast is...
534648	538652	If you have to sign a contract, read the damn thing first.
539432	549882	Don't just sign your name to it and then call customer service when you don't understand what you've just signed when they bill you for something or when something goes wrong because you were a big retard and didn't read it.
550883	552764	Always read before you sign.
552864	555707	I don't care how many damn pages it is or if it's in Swahili.
557483	559945	If it's a contract, they have to pay for you to read it.
560005	560765	You can get a lawyer.
561166	562347	Just read it first.
563087	567770	Understand what you are signing your name to, because a contract is binding and legal.
567850	570312	Unless you're under the age of majority within your state, and then that's another story.
570692	577517	Correct me if I'm wrong, though, but if everybody actually read their contracts, wouldn't customer service employees be without a job?
577978	579859	No, because people are still fundamentally retarded.
580279	580520	Oh, okay.
580720	581140	Just checking.
583427	586008	And really now, why would you be signing a contract in Swahili?
586048	587328	I mean, that's just retarded.
588128	589148	What if you're from Africa?
590409	592149	But, ah, damn it.
594010	595290	Still though, it should be English.
595810	596390	English.
598451	599071	Alright, alright.
600111	602512	Loki, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.
602552	608393	For those guys that like to emulate their favorite music games on the computer, or, I'm sorry, emulate versus simulate.
608413	609774	I'll get yelled at by somebody for that.
610294	610754	Simulate.
611789	618055	Well, really, one big thing, because a lot of websites are down because of different reasons.
618155	627124	But anyways, the big thing that came out this week would be Technofiend 3, which is the brand new Stepmania skin, for those who might not know.
628745	632509	It was just released, actually, on Bumaisel.com.
632529	636612	You can find it in their downloadable sim file section.
638063	639883	Technofiend 3.0 Stepmania 3.9 Release Candidate 2
665683	667444	Release Candidate 2A, I think.
667564	669765	It's the one that's on stepmania.com.
670205	671246	You can download it there.
671466	676708	Just get the new upgrade, download that skin, and it's heaven right there.
676828	678829	That's all you need to know.
680810	686132	And again, since this is the first podcast, there might be people listening to this that have no idea what you just said, which is possible.
686752	692195	Again, sometimes folks have taken the concept of DDR and built these simulators around it, and Loki...
693104	694365	He's our man in the scene.
694465	697466	He knows about what's going on, so he's always going to bring you those kinds of updates.
698087	701628	Again, StepMania is the most popular Dance Dance Revolution simulator.
701768	705150	It's available over at www.stepmania.com.
705470	709572	But simulators being built for games other than DDR, right?
709592	710993	There's other types of simulators out there.
712133	713474	Any popular recommendations?
714254	715915	There's some for Guitar Freaks.
716575	717616	That's DTXMania.
719105	722888	Step Mania is an all-in-one simulator game.
748632	749693	Techno something or other.
749993	752615	It's some 8-panel, 9-panel thing that there's like... Technomotion.
752635	753336	Technomotion.
753376	756278	There's like, what, three of those in the entire world or something?
756378	756739	I don't know.
756759	758400	And I think like two of them are in Las Vegas.
758700	759821	Yeah, two of them are in Vegas.
759881	760542	I mean, whatever.
760862	762283	So there's those that are coming.
763224	768128	Tons of, you know, games that no one really plays anymore, but, you know...
768527	772468	They're going to be coming to simulator stuff right now, though, if you want to play right now.
772528	775049	DTX Mania, which would be one for Drum Mania.
775449	779831	You can find tons of information on all these other simulator stuff on the Bomani Style forums.
779851	783092	They actually have whole sections dedicated to these simulators.
783672	787534	I don't really play much Guitar Freaks because I don't have any good controllers for them or anything like that.
788134	796297	As far as Beat Mania goes, Delight Delight, Reduplication, and there's Beemania DX is the other good one.
796846	797947	So check those out.
798007	800688	Or BM98, that's another good one to find out.
801729	803550	And that's pretty much all that's simulated out there.
803570	809434	I know there's also Feeling Pomo, which is the popping music one, which is supposed to be pretty good.
809574	816038	But like I said, Stepmania 4.0 is supposed to have them all together, and it would be a lot easier than having six different programs.
816098	817539	So look for that.
818928	820349	All right, we'll see what happens there.
820489	824093	All right, let's move on to what's going on in the rest of the gaming world.
824453	827536	Now, the gaming world's kind of quiet right now because it's the holidays.
827576	831479	We're just coming, you know, this is the first week of 2005, so we're just coming off the holidays.
831920	835823	So there's not a whole lot kind of new going on, exciting.
836144	843670	And I'm sure we're going to start, as the new year comes back, we're going to start hearing a whole lot of stuff right up until E3 because they're going to start dropping little hints here and there.
843710	845452	So we'll do our best to keep you guys on top of that.
846181	849942	But in the meantime, there's sometimes news that you can't control.
850903	855044	And that is the news, one of the oldest American ways of business, the lawsuit.
855444	857265	But this one's kind of amusing, if you think about it.
857545	860466	You guys remember this game that came out this year called The Guy Game?
861046	864288	And it was basically Girls Gone Wild in game form.
865448	866809	You must love this concept, Loki.
868029	871310	No, this has actually been done like Howard Stern and The Man Show.
871830	872971	I know it's been done before.
873291	875652	They basically kind of ripped it off and...
877065	878127	Jack with Naked Chicks
888562	893188	It would be a good idea, but unfortunately there was one little thing these guys forgot to check.
893828	902038	And now what's happened is that Cox News Service last week reported that a young woman, and they're not giving out her name, they're calling her Jane Doe.
902078	908366	She has filed suit against Take-Two, Sony, and Microsoft because this game was out on PlayStation 2 and Xbox.
909026	910647	Take two are the folks that made the game there.
910687	914588	They have filed suit because it has footage of her topless.
915128	920050	And this was taken during the annual spring break on Texas South Padre Island.
920090	927513	Well, okay, that's where they get a lot of these girls to show their assets, so to speak, is at these events by getting them inebriated.
927533	929493	But there was one little teeny problem.
930534	931274	The girl was only 17.
931374	931934	Oops-doe.
931974	933835	No, Jane-doe.
938905	942266	Jamie, as a girl, a gamer girl, what do you think of this?
943747	948269	First of all, I think that showing your boobs for anybody is about the most retarded thing you can do.
948909	958653	Being from the South, from where Mardi Gras originated, I think that all those stupid tourists that go to New Orleans to flash their tits for, you know, boom pies, are retarded.
958814	960854	And so are all the ones who do the Girls Gone Wild thing.
961415	962075	They're sluts.
963041	963621	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
981551	982692	Thanks for watching!
1011502	1011922	You know what?
1012342	1013583	I think her parents should pay for this.
1013623	1016704	They should, you know, make her parents pay for this kind of thing.
1016724	1017404	Because guess what?
1017444	1019584	She was, um... I don't know.
1019604	1021305	I'm sure there's laws against that, though.
1021905	1023946	I know there's laws against that, and her parents should pay.
1025046	1025546	God damn it.
1025606	1026746	Ruining our entertainment.
1027907	1029547	Always these stupid little hang-ups.
1031188	1032848	Jamie, any response to this?
1035669	1037229	Uh... I actually agree with that.
1037530	1037970	Stupid.
1038010	1038870	She knew where she was going.
1039793	1040353	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1058456	1062737	I told Dan to buy BMX XXX just because I wanted to see what all the crap was in it.
1062777	1065058	Now, I did buy that game and that game is quite nice.
1065098	1067119	But here's my thing, okay?
1067239	1073281	With everything that has to do with putting people on film and everything, there's a little thing called a release agreement.
1074585	1076145	Where was that in this, okay?
1076225	1078786	What, they just filmed it and didn't sign a release?
1079126	1080407	Shame on Take-Two.
1081147	1085768	I'm sure she signed a release, but the problem is, if you're under 18, you can't sign the contract.
1085788	1086808	So she probably said she was 18.
1087649	1089409	They just didn't check her ID.
1089729	1094370	But of course, if all you're wearing is panties and nothing else, then you probably don't have your ID on you.
1094810	1100132	There still is a thing, even if there was a contract, having taken business law,
1101338	1104239	A contract against a minor is not a binding contract.
1104319	1105840	It is a voided contract.
1106420	1109041	And so, legally, yes, she does have the right to sue.
1111362	1113302	But, damn girl, just keep your clothes on.
1114203	1115523	Don't be a slut!
1115603	1116404	It's that easy.
