209	14676	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition E3 2005 Special Friday Edition You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14936	18358	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20629	25330	All right, here we are back with our final day here at E3.
25370	33192	And I don't know if my co-hosts are feeling it like I am, but I think I'm ready for this show to be about over by now.
33932	34772	My name is Rob Roberts.
34792	35792	You might know me as Sky.
35852	38493	My co-hosts, Loki, the one and only.
38953	39273	Hi.
39993	42454	And also DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
43854	44754	I need a new body.
46074	46874	So what do you think?
47155	49095	Are you ready for this show to be over or what, Loki?
50091	50411	DarkSakura
66047	75289	Now, for those people at home that are probably yelling at us going, Dude, I would kill to be at E3 for anything, and you guys are bitching about having to be there for three whole days.
75729	76289	What would you say?
76369	78989	Why is it that you kind of get burned out on E3?
79249	80190	Okay, how about this?
80230	80730	I'll tell you what.
81350	82610	Let's say you're on the East Coast.
83030	84310	Start walking to E3.
84790	87791	Once you get there, now you know what it's like to be there for three days.
89431	93292	Your feet hurt like a bitch, and you're bored out of your mind, and you're thinking...
94491	94912	Why?
95192	96253	Why is it three days long?
96293	96873	No, I don't know.
97014	102199	Actually, it's just you walk around pretty much everything, and you've already seen everything.
102279	110247	Unless you're in meetings all the time, like we aren't, you really see pretty much everything in about two days.
112236	112516	I don't know.
112556	113537	I found more stuff today.
114157	116478	Actually, I made today my standing in line day.
117419	122521	So I got in to see something I'm going to talk about momentarily on the show.
123081	124242	And I went into the Sega Theater.
124582	125803	Again, I'm going to talk about that later.
125963	132746	But I got to get in and see things and I got into running into people who get me into other things.
134432	135133	Thanks for watching!
151153	167624	so I think that about sums it up for me but I know a lot of us got to do some cool things on this third day so I would typically do the three things but well I won't put a cap on it today let's just say share things with our audience that you think was cool today we'll start off with DarkSakura since I know she's got at least two things right there
168760	173123	I went into the Sega Theater today, got to see the new Sonic game that they're doing.
173163	175264	I believe it's for the Xbox 360.
176025	179707	It's pretty damn good looking, and it was a real-time demo.
180148	184351	So he was playing it, one of the developers there was playing it as they were doing.
184411	192196	There's that serial killer game, Conspiracy, I think that's what it's called.
193317	194818	Condemned, I knew it was a con something.
194918	196479	See, my brain's fried, it's the end of the con.
197339	206167	um, The Condemned, that was pretty spooky, but it seemed sort of, hi, I'm a big ugly thing, I'm gonna hit you on the head with this hammer, BAM!
207648	207828	Ow.
208448	209249	You know, that type of game.
209830	224081	And then, um, there was, uh, there's that Full Auto game, now the Full Auto was pretty cool, it was sort of like, I'm going to run into this building, wait, nope, I didn't want to do that, Rewind, called the Unwreck, and then Drive Forward.
224662	226143	Keep going, that was pretty cool, and also, uh,
226875	227735	Met somebody.
227775	228876	His name was Eric.
228936	232318	If he's listening, I introduced him to the show, so hi.
232918	233318	New person.
233918	239421	In fact, to all of you people who I have met at the convention, if you're listening to us, hi.
239441	241662	I also met one of Jason's friends.
242903	243383	Randomly.
244023	246024	Sitting on the floor at Squinnix.
246864	248165	But I'll go into that later.
249005	254208	At any rate, I couldn't get into Squinnix and they were out of tickets by the time I got up there, which was shitty!
255603	260744	So I trotted on over and I tried to peek at the Activision stuff.
260764	261405	I was like, eh.
261605	262165	So I kept going.
263225	268126	Made it over to where the PS3 line was.
269027	272988	And for being wrapped around the building, the wait was not as long as I thought it was going to be.
273028	275028	They're saying, this is a three hour wait.
275088	277329	I got there in 25 minutes and I was at the tail end.
278329	285813	Um, they did some type of HDTV demo thing, and then they actually let you take you into another theater where you can sit for a little bit.
286613	290715	And, uh, you, they showed what the system can do.
290835	291736	It's rad.
291756	293857	They built a city there on screen.
294877	297298	Um, they also showed some of the games that are currently in development.
298059	302541	They didn't list names of the games, but some of us could tell one of them was a new Tekken.
303582	306926	They showed Jin up there with sweat coming out of his body.
307607	309310	And this apparently is done in-game engine.
311873	314156	One that looked like one of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games.
316299	317520	Some type of off-road game.
318341	320162	This was a very destructive off-road game.
320662	328385	It shows this one scene with a motorbike guy getting back up on his bike with a car about to land on him after an explosion.
328405	329566	It was pretty intense.
330126	330646	I got out.
331386	332167	I see the PS3.
333827	339210	took pictures of the PS3, which will be on orangeislandradio.com.
339830	344133	The other cool thing is that I played more Nintendogs.
344173	348275	I played Romancing Saga, and actually I got into H-Tech.
349324	350184	That was pretty cool.
350644	352285	Got to play a new game.
352805	364929	For anyone who is an anime fan or big importer of RPGs, coming out on the PSP, I do believe you said winter, is Popokuros, which has been a pretty big series.
366530	367910	It's a 2D RPG.
367991	372132	It is the first true RPG for the system to be released in the States.
372961	374643	So be on the lookout for that.
374683	380008	And also got to see Formula Front Armored Core.
380268	380929	That was pretty cool.
381790	390118	Working on right now is Wild Arms Ultra F, which has actually been delayed by about five months, but it gives them time to tweak the translation.
391879	393861	Also, RPG Maker 3.
394942	397344	Now that, I have to say, I was very impressed with.
397364	405270	The last RPG Maker, you know, I was kind of into that, and I was into the first one because I was one of those people that was petitioning for it to get off the Super Famicom and get over to the U.S.
406511	409433	This one was pretty, pretty awesome.
409594	415038	I mean, it's not like you're playing, you know, this little ghetto game that you just piece together with duct tape.
415478	417860	This is fully rendered trees.
417980	420682	You can paint your textures onto mountains and
421042	425244	You choose what style your sprites are going to look like.
425424	429726	You can choose, you know how on RPGs it has a picture of your character over the text box.
430026	435449	You can do conversation characters and have them in an anime style or you can have them in a conventional American style.
435509	436029	It was pretty cool.
438096	440937	There was a game maker that was supposed to be coming out on the PSP.
441037	442317	Is this the game maker?
442537	444638	This is on PS2.
445178	454160	There's one coming out for the PSP and there's so many things they could do for this, but I know they're not going to because they just don't think ahead.
454500	461421	For example, the PSP, you could have it where you could upload your own pictures or something like that from the internet or your own music or something.
461441	464242	You make your own game and then distribute that game over the internet.
464782	465402	That would be cool.
465902	467582	Of course, you know, they're not going to think of that.
468523	469143	I think of that.
469303	469783	They don't.
470123	472783	They might have thought of it, but it might take money out of their pocket.
475584	477604	All right, Loki, what kind of stuff did you look at today?
478485	480825	I looked at a few things.
481305	485666	I went back for a second peek at... What was that?
485826	489667	That one erotic whatever... Feel 3.
489747	490167	Feel 3.
490247	493748	The cyber sex game that dominated... Yeah, I had to show that to Jason today.
494648	495548	Apparently, there's...
496482	499465	Peripherals for this game.
500226	502228	Sex peripherals for this game.
503130	503911	I'll leave it at that.
504591	505933	Use your imagination, boys and girls.
505953	510218	Basically, folks, this is the definition of cybersex.
510258	514223	That puts the Rez vibration machine to shame.
514543	520229	Oh, this is a device that vibrates that's not going to be confused with a transvibrator.
520249	525353	Let's just let the audience use their imagination on that one, shall we?
525393	526274	It's very phallic.
528436	530438	So yeah, that's interesting.
530458	533921	I'll have to check out the website later.
534822	536504	I like how he's like, it's kind of weird.
536604	537445	Yeah, I'll check it later.
538300	539301	I have to check it out.
539842	542625	You have to research it on behalf of our listeners, of course.
542866	544107	Not that you have any interest in this.
544127	546070	You're just doing it in favor of the listeners, right?
546170	547551	I honestly don't want to buy this.
548590	555532	This is one of those games that's going to be weird because, you know, I can't go about normal methods of distribution for this game.
555992	556893	So, whatever.
556913	570477	But anyways, I got to finally, finally play in the group today on Rockstar's new... Yes, which is interesting because they weren't showing the game on Wednesday when we went by the booth the first time, but today they actually showed the game on PS2.
570497	576479	In the group, and I got to test out Red Octane's new pads.
576579	577359	They're the metal ones.
578480	581683	and I have to say that both disappoint me very much.
582023	582904	And guess what?
583044	584726	I still have the same opinion about In The Groove.
584786	589911	It's still a knockoff of DDR and it's going to be treated as such in my mind.
590352	596418	Those new pads, they look pretty solid, but they've got a few fatal flaws in them.
596538	601843	One of them being that the arrows are recessed too far and it feels really awkward playing on them and I didn't like them one bit.
601923	605948	I don't know, it might be a personal opinion thing, because when I played them a couple weeks ago, they were great to me.
606028	607790	I really enjoyed them.
607930	621307	All they gotta do to fix it, raise up those arrows just a teeny little bit, just a few millimeters, just to make it, just set in a little bit, not too much, don't go crazy, and then instead of making them all rubbery,
621980	623080	Make Them Metal.
623220	626181	But then you played two other DDR mats as well, right?
626721	630021	Yeah, and then that one starts to look pretty good when you look at the other two, right?
630261	635902	Okay, the second one was DDRGame.com, their metal pad with their bar.
636022	636743	Which had a bar, yeah.
636823	637823	Which had a bar, yeah.
638383	639303	Yeah, the pads sucked.
639403	646684	Okay, those pads, they were all shiny and it basically had soft pad syndrome where you can't tell where the hell the arrows are.
647084	650085	And what's worse about the DDRGame.com ones...
651605	655886	If you miss the pad, you're going to hurt your leg, because it's raised up.
655946	657647	Which happened to somebody, we know, actually.
657847	662048	It happened to someone, so I cannot recommend this.
662128	665489	But it's the only one you're going to see that has the solo arrows actually on it.
666149	668670	Although most just use the buttons.
668930	675312	They did do something kind of neat, and I'll give them credit for this, because softpads, they're pretty much all the same out there.
675332	678853	But they actually had a doubles softpad, which I thought was pretty cool.
679758	683321	The only thing I can see that would suck about that is if one side breaks down.
683341	684101	Oh crap.
684422	687484	So yeah, I tried that one.
687524	688485	That was pretty cool.
689686	693208	And really, I don't know, DDR pads, they're just all about the same.
694529	697011	Then, what else did I get to try out today?
698352	699553	I watched Kingdom Hearts 2.
699673	700894	That looked pretty cool.
701595	706899	And then, really, it's just a lot of hanging around Konami's booth, checking that stuff out.
707719	731470	and talking to like some of the people you know trying to get you know not necessarily press kits but on their email list for my work and that kind of thing and I have to say that the people EA can suck it because they have this you know we're better than everyone else attitude and I mean they've done that to our company as a whole like you know when our company yeah we're distributing games they're like yeah we don't care it's just like big deal you know
732930	733791	You know, the hell with them.
734011	739434	And it seems like, honestly, from hearing other people's... Did they have anything at their booth that interested any of us?
739474	742776	They had their new test drive, Most Wanted.
743836	745157	I was looking at the stuff for The Sims.
745297	746598	Sims 2 for PSP is pretty cool.
748206	749107	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
768767	776634	It was kind of a misconception, at least I certainly thought that PlayStation would be one I'd be waiting just as long in as Zelda.
776914	779416	But the interesting thing is that the Zelda line ran out of shirts today.
779476	781978	So some people that went through the whole thing didn't even get a shirt.
783019	787703	I did get to play Nintendogs, and that game is so damn... I've got to get that game.
787823	790805	I already knew I was going to buy the game before I actually played it.
791426	792587	But it's just...
793307	795370	It's such a game, I don't even know.
795410	801917	This is gonna, honestly, people are gonna play this game and it's gonna be just like Animal Crossing where you just can't get enough of it.
802017	803319	You're just gonna be playing it all the time.
803339	807083	You're gonna be worrying about your pets are not getting walked or something when you're out.
807263	809726	I think it is gonna be like the next Tamagotchi.
809806	813650	Now don't shun it just because I say it that way, but...
816192	820415	I think it's going to be something that appeals to a more broader age range.
820495	821816	Just the whole trade and everything.
822016	825598	Now, Jamie just brought up something to me I forgot to ask her.
825678	826779	How was the boomerang?
828180	829041	On the PS3?
829161	830822	What was your impressions of the boomerang?
831442	833143	I'm looking at my picture of it right now.
834484	837106	I'm trying to imagine how this thing would feel in my hand.
838393	844557	Now for those that are a little bit lost, the boomerang is what we are calling the controller on the PS3 because it looks like, well, a boomerang.
845098	845478	It does.
845778	846859	It looks like a half moon.
846879	847639	You know what it looks like?
847679	850281	It looks like an old school Microsoft Sidewinder.
850841	852082	Yeah, yeah, it does.
852262	853183	And guess what, folks?
853603	854784	The Sidewinder... I don't understand.
854844	856505	Honestly, stick with DualShock.
857626	858367	That's what I say.
858707	864931	Yeah, I couldn't just... It didn't seem like it would be all that comfortable, but I don't know.
865111	866192	And it's only conceptual.
866532	867673	It said concept controller.
869204	873228	So maybe they'll make some changes and make it less boomerang-y, I don't know.
873288	894188	Stuff I checked out today, I actually got to play a little bit of Kingdom Hearts 2, and very interesting, I have to admit I wasn't so into the first one, I know a lot of people consider it to be this great game, and I respect the game, but I couldn't get into it, because I got really, really bothered by the camera, like that whole 3D thing that can annoy me on some of those games sometimes.
894788	912318	I didn't have these same problems in Kingdom Hearts 2, it looks like they went back and fixed some of that, and they added a couple new modes too, like they have this overdrive mode, like you might think of this from Final Fantasies, kinda similar, but more towards the Kingdom Hearts concept, where if you build up enough strength, you can go into overdrive mode, and you transform, and you have two blades, so that's kinda neat.
912728	913269	Thank you for watching!
928852	933555	Um, yeah, did you actually, uh, of course you had Auron there.
933596	934997	Did you do the fusions?
935637	937618	No, I did not get a chance to do the fusions.
938259	941221	With Goofy, that's the Valor one, that's awesome.
941241	942722	He dual-wields the Keyblades.
943122	944763	Yeah, having Auron in the game was kind of neat, though.
944783	946445	I gotta say, that's kind of a neat addition to the game.
947025	949287	Another game I checked out today was Hello Kitty Roller Rescue.
949347	950908	Now stop laughing, stop laughing.
951972	956933	I was drawn to this game because I love Batsamaru the penguin and I saw that he was in the game so I had to check it out.
957613	960314	Hello Kitty Roller Rescue is very interesting.
960454	962635	I'm sure there's an audience out there for it somewhere.
964295	968076	Even though I do love Batsamaru I can't personally say I would buy this game.
968476	971737	I would buy it for a child but I don't know if I could buy it for myself.
972257	975818	I became too frustrated because Hello Kitty would not jump over everything.
975858	979059	There was only certain things like some weird collision detection.
979399	980619	I don't know what it is but just...
982000	983021	It wasn't as interactive.
984161	984942	It just felt weird.
985242	986222	But a kid would be into it.
986342	987503	A kid wouldn't be bothered by it.
987523	989403	And that's what it was really for.
990124	992405	So that was one of the other games I saw today.
994025	995446	I guess that's all I really want to say.
995626	996606	Oh, one other game.
996686	999047	I actually saw this yesterday, but I forgot to bring it up on yesterday's show.
999568	1000548	The Capcom Collection.
1001308	1003369	It has a bunch of old school Capcom arcade games.
1003629	1006411	Ghouls N' Ghosts, Super Ghouls N' Ghosts, and the one I played, 1943.
1007791	1008151	All in it.
1008632	1009552	Kind of a neat collection.
1009833	1013095	Seems like kind of the popular trend right now with the retro-ness.
1013135	1015276	Having the Flashback console, Atari.
1015657	1019559	Having the Capcom collection, the Namco one.
1019599	1021200	They're doing a new one that's really big.
1022221	1023082	Very interesting trend.
1023362	1024923	Did you get to play any Final Fight?
1025363	1026484	I did not play Final Fight.
1027225	1029146	It's very wonky right now.
1029566	1030126	It was pretty cool.
1030146	1030847	The new Final Fight?
1030867	1031407	The new Final Fight.
1031427	1031767	Okay, yeah.
1031787	1034989	I actually played the new Romancing Saga as well.
1035009	1035869	Which thing?
1035909	1037390	I was never big into the Saga games.
1037430	1040811	It was kind of cool, but it looks like a freaking PS1 game.
1041371	1042492	It's just not clean.
1042692	1045193	Yeah, Sagas were games that never impressed me either.
1045233	1047114	I was like, I can sort of follow this.
1048094	1048415	All right.
1049115	1053617	Okay, now since the show is all done, I'd like us to go around and think about the best games
1054301	1056943	Let's do best booth at the show first.
1056983	1058384	The best booth.
1058465	1063769	Who there at the show do you believe had the best booth out of anybody and why?
1063789	1065250	Anybody want to start?
1065650	1067732	It's kind of... DarkSakura.
1067872	1072416	There's places that did things better, I think.
1072876	1077480	But overall, I have to give... It's actually a toss-up.
1077840	1078701	It really is a toss-up.
1078821	1079521	Okay, a tie.
1079622	1080022	What do you think?
1082498	1088381	I'm going to have to say that between Konami and Namco, I mean, just Konami went all out with that show.
1088481	1090042	That was really cool.
1090082	1094945	So as far as their presentation, Konami had the better show.
1095605	1106751	But as far as overall, like I was saying yesterday, friendliness, knowledge, the fun swag, I have to say that Namco really impressed me.
1106791	1107452	Their lineup.
1107672	1109553	I got to play, oh, I also played Pack'n Roll.
1110379	1116523	And when someone came over and saw that I had the hang of playing it, they didn't harass me.
1116663	1117444	I just got to play it.
1117484	1118925	We talked a little bit about it.
1119766	1121987	The people at Namco Mobile were fun.
1122067	1123188	They were just happy.
1123708	1127611	They ran out of the little squishy Pac-Man things, but they apologized for it.
1129672	1131394	They knew what they were doing.
1131494	1133275	They were happy to do what they were doing.
1133935	1135176	Our co-host for...
1136597	1144764	Outside of the Box, SlankyStyle, he actually got a short video clip of the Prince of the Cosmos breakdancing.
1145965	1146346	Really?
1147667	1149528	We're hoping to make a LiveJournal icon out of that.
1149549	1152391	We'll have to post that in our Orange Lounge LiveJournal community once that's done.
1152951	1156895	Okay, so DarkSakura saying toss-up between Konami and Namco.
1157535	1159817	Loki, what do you think was the best booth at the show?
1163635	1168078	Well, oh man, it's tough.
1168118	1175162	I'm so biased just because I hung out at Konami's booth a long time, pretty much the majority of the time while I was there.
1176082	1177283	Only because of a few things.
1177603	1181325	One, the whole stage area right there where they had the DDR games.
1181705	1184206	Very open, you're not really feeling crowded in there.
1184246	1187428	Plus you can sit down and watch the little trailer reel that they've got there.
1188195	1189477	Couldn't really do that anywhere else.
1189957	1198665	Also, I guess as far as being the least offensive booth of them all, because they didn't really have any booth babes jumping around.
1198705	1201488	They had actually something that appealed to everyone.
1202068	1202909	That was kind of cool.
1205371	1212118	However, there is a close second, and that would be Game Infinity, and only because they had X-Tango in the sex game there.
1212498	1214500	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1236577	1237238	Just sitting there.
1238540	1240162	I was like, I didn't get it.
1240563	1241604	I just didn't get it.
1241944	1245770	And guys were standing there, probably sitting there thinking, I wonder if they'll do it.
1252119	1252919	I didn't get it.
1253720	1265584	Probably my second runner-up would be actually the G4 booth because they had a pretty cool setup there as far as like sit down, chill, watch their shows, make a t-shirt, which at least you're guaranteed a t-shirt that way.
1266004	1268545	They had the people giving out those ouch kits.
1268625	1269546	Those are pretty awesome.
1269566	1270346	That's awesome.
1270942	1274825	I also have to give a special kudos to the Tylenol Ouch booth and the cute guy that gave me a back massage.
1287610	1302871	I would say if I had to pick one booth of the show and I hate to kind of echo what somebody else already said but honestly for me there was one booth that I feel they put all their cards out on the table everybody there was really friendly I got to play their games they have a hell of a lineup this year
1303832	1331314	and that booth would be Namco I would say would be my booth of the year I was just blown away by what they've got to offer I think between like We Heart Katamari, Soul Calibur 3, Pac-Man and even semi-decent mobile games as well and usually I'm not very impressed with cell phone games but the ones I played were pretty decent for a cell phone certainly more so than some of the other ones I played at the show and I just felt that Namco they also had various stage shows going on with the whole Soul Calibur battles and stuff
1332533	1335035	It really was, for me, I think the most impressive lineup at the show.
1335575	1336916	So that would be my booth as a show.
1336976	1337277	All right.
1338277	1341920	Best... You want to do best game or you want to do worst booth next?
1342961	1343782	Worst booth.
1343802	1344182	Worst booth.
1344202	1344863	DarkSakura.
1347165	1348806	For attitude, it was Capcom.
1349467	1354150	Bunch of apathetic... You know, Capcom as a company has my love.
1354411	1356432	You know, been a long time Capcom fan.
1356893	1359495	But the people who they had working the information booth...
1360709	1362150	They were just rude.
1362951	1363992	Rude as they could be.
1364212	1367754	Yeah, we kind of talked about it yesterday, so you guys know how we feel about it.
1367874	1373058	They just displayed so much apathy that I can't say that Capcom really impressed me.
1373078	1375940	They really didn't have a whole lot of games.
1376241	1381965	I mean, and I want to answer an email real quick, because while we're on Capcom, I'm so sorry to interject, but if I don't do it now, I'll forget.
1382245	1389831	Somebody wrote us an email about Mega Man Battle Network and wanted to know how it would link up with the other DS...
1390875	1391775	Battle Network Games.
1392295	1400877	And basically what we found out is that there is some type of tournament mode, so you can play Battle Network against the DS Wireless, but we did not see anything in any of the materials so far.
1400937	1406918	I haven't dug through the whole book, but in the little promo video we saw, we didn't see anything about it linking up to the Game Boy Advance versions or anything.
1406958	1409938	It's just a type of online battle tournament mode.
1409978	1411079	Anyway, I just wanted to interject that.
1412759	1417120	Okay.
1417400	1419260	Everybody put on a really good display game
1419835	1424458	Actually, Gizmondo was also really excellent for... We're doing worse poof!
1424538	1425939	I'm using it as a comparison.
1426339	1429961	Because, you know, Gizmondo was sort of like, eh, we're Gizmondo last year.
1430562	1436425	And this year, like, hey, we're freaking Gizmondo and we're bringing out people to rap and spin and dance for you and everything.
1437046	1440628	But, Capcom was the same as they were last year.
1440668	1442809	Just, we don't want to fucking be here.
1443610	1446652	You know, true, it may be work.
1447219	1449000	But you should be happy in the work that you do.
1449120	1453641	And the guys at Namco, they were having to do every bit of a boring job that you were.
1454061	1455742	But they were all smiles and friendly.
1456942	1460984	So Capcom must be the dullest place on earth to work for or something.
1461844	1463445	Alright, so is that your worst booth?
1463465	1465225	Or do you have an overall worst booth?
1465325	1468647	Well, like I said, the displays and everything were great.
1469027	1473768	For everywhere, there wasn't anything really disappointing as far as their look.
1475049	1475309	But...
1476718	1479739	Yeah, I have to say that Capcom, it was just the attitude.
1479839	1481960	The attitude soured their whole booth for me.
1482340	1483081	Alright, Loki.
1484421	1485082	This one's easy.
1486382	1491684	I'd like to give a big thank you to Rockstar for saving me time for having to play their games.
1492124	1492865	Because guess what?
1492925	1498027	They rented out this huge, huge booth and put some buses there and said, Ha!
1498147	1499448	You don't get to play anything!
1499728	1500128	Eat that!
1500468	1501708	You're gonna buy our games anyways.
1502049	1502869	Suck it!
1503229	1503769	And that was it.
1503829	1505150	They didn't have jacked.
1508231	1517615	The only picture I saw of Bully was in a magazine I got there for free.
1518055	1523977	So I actually saw more of Rockstar's lineup from some stupid magazine than, you know, their actual booth.
1524417	1533121	You know what, I'm tired of these game companies thinking that their stuff's all kick-ass just because, you know, the last couple games, which have all been exactly the same, I might add,
1533741	1534921	have sold really awesome.
1534941	1535521	But guess what?
1535541	1536001	You know what?
1536041	1537482	Save Emergency sucked balls.
1537562	1538262	So you know what?
1539462	1546643	I hope Bully does too because I'm not giving you my money just for the same damn rehash game with maybe a different genre.
1547103	1549564	Not necessarily a different genre, a different time period it's set in.
1551224	1551544	All right.
1551584	1558505	Well, for my worst booth, again, I hate to echo what somebody else already said, but just because of the fact that it was an eyesore.
1558565	1560626	I mean, the booth itself was an eyesore.
1560986	1561666	And just the fact...
1562196	1562817	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1577478	1579160	I didn't want to stop and look at anything.
1579200	1580601	And I know they're trying to show new games.
1580821	1582543	I didn't want to stop and look.
1582583	1584025	Horrible position for them, too.
1584245	1585126	Their booth was in a bad spot, too.
1585206	1591212	I understand if they want to do press-only for these games, because obviously they're probably in progress and they don't want any bad people to look.
1591472	1595315	But even still, last year, I didn't see their games.
1595976	1597598	They were behind closed doors.
1597618	1599279	You can go and make an appointment to play it.
1599500	1601421	This was just like rubbing it in your face.
1601481	1601762	It's like...
1602402	1603623	Oh, hey, guess what?
1603703	1607627	You can go in here and play games if you're pressed and if you make an appointment.
1607687	1611630	And just the chain-link fence and the giant buses were just an eyesore.
1611970	1612611	They didn't need to be there.
1612631	1619836	With all the other neon nice effects, just to have that ghetto-looking booth was just... You know what?
1620097	1625561	I honestly learned about Rockstar's lineup from posters that were outside on Hollywood Boulevard.
1625601	1627182	That's where I learned about their stuff.
1627202	1631406	So when I saw their booth with the buses, I was like, whoopity-freaking-doo-dah, you know?
1632126	1633168	There are so many good ones.
1655171	1655993	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1667236	1669297	It's like a toss-up between three games, seriously.
1669337	1670417	Okay, then name the three.
1671177	1673138	We Love Katamari, definitely.
1673578	1675378	Nintendogs and Animal Crossing DS.
1678179	1680540	And Call of Cthulhu, but I'm not going to go into that.
1681220	1685501	But I would have to say those three were the top of the show.
1685521	1688042	Well, actually, those three had me convinced to be the top of the show.
1688763	1690424	I'm gonna get We Heart Katamari, that's for sure.
1690444	1690925	And why is that?
1710778	1711939	It's because it's Katamari.
1711979	1712579	It's just fun.
1712819	1713639	It's also cheap.
1713659	1716040	What does the sequel offer that the first one doesn't though?
1716420	1717821	Why should people run out and get it?
1718221	1720542	It's more of the same game.
1720642	1721142	Who cares?
1722063	1723123	That's why you want to get it.
1723203	1727305	Everything you loved about the first game is in the second game and just wackier and better.
1727665	1728085	Let me help.
1728145	1729307	Co-op mode as well.
1730488	1731248	Who cares about that?
1731809	1733270	I'm just talking about more game.
1733310	1735532	You finish the first game and you're like, I want more.
1735892	1736473	Give me more.
1738094	1739015	This will be cool.
1739035	1741437	Nintendogs will be awesome.
1741457	1745961	I've got to get Animal Crossing just because everyone else is going to have it and I don't want to feel left out.
1746782	1749604	I think those are probably the ones.
1749905	1751646	Are you going to let your puppies play with my puppies?
1752987	1753248	Maybe.
1753488	1754689	I'm going to call my dog Bacon.
1756522	1756822	All right.
1757903	1768274	My game of the show, you know I love games that do something new that isn't just the same old crap over and over again and bring something new to the table.
1768434	1777623	I like interactive games that help you do – like I loved Animal Crossing 1 because you could interact with other people in unique ways.
1777703	1779245	So I just love originality.
1779865	1789754	and this game was just damn good looking too and I had fun with it I had a lot of fun with it which is something I cannot say about most games game of the show for me would be Nintendogs
1791069	1795091	which is odd because I'm totally not a dog person but I loved Nintendogs.
1795512	1796732	It was so cute.
1797193	1799294	I'd like to discuss this stuff right here.
1799434	1807218	I pulled open my little show daily magazine here and they have one of .com awards for what they thought were the best in show stuff.
1807818	1809599	Can I finish my thought on best in show stuff?
1809639	1810560	Well, I thought you were done.
1810600	1811320	No, I'm not done.
1811400	1811920	I have a runner-up.
1812641	1813401	You all got a runner-up.
1813421	1813982	I want a runner-up.
1814482	1818484	My runner-up would be actually Meteos, the new puzzle game that's going to be coming out on DSP.
1819071	1820052	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1836125	1844468	The best in show, my thoughts, and runner-up to DS games, when I've kind of knocked the DS quite a bit over the past few months because they've had really a crap lineup.
1844828	1851410	Well, the DS is, it is true, the DS is going to get a hell of a lot better over the next nine months.
1851750	1861853	And, you know, if you are in the DS versus PSP mindset, I still think both systems are very separate, and if you really want to experience everything, you're going to have to own both.
1862804	1866265	It's going to be a close contest for those looking at one or the other.
1866905	1868026	Just look at it this way, people.
1868066	1873027	You're not going to have to actually get an external keyboard if they put Linux on the DS versus the PSP.
1873527	1876788	I had a moment of comedy, though, speaking of the DS stuff.
1877648	1881349	I was trying to download Electroplankton from the PSP area.
1884370	1886351	And having a Sony person comment on it.
1888120	1888400	Huh.
1889361	1889822	Alright.
1890863	1894206	Okay, yeah, Loki, you were going to get into what somebody else felt was the best.
1894226	1897289	1up.com, their awards, Game of the Show, they gave it to Legend of Zelda.
1897349	1908079	I haven't seen the game, so... Yeah, I mean, to be honest, I think our awards, quote-unquote, you have to remember, are from our perspective, and our perspective was we were...
1909280	1918405	Even though we're borderline media, we went in as non-media, just like the sales people, just like the students and the folks that are barely in the industry.
1918666	1928131	From our perspective, Legend of Zelda was not easily accessible, so therefore it kind of gets a strike against it when it comes to really the most impressive thing at the show.
1928372	1928872	Exactly.
1929172	1931193	Best visuals, Unreal Tournament 2007.
1931794	1934495	Once again, another thing that you had to wait in line to go see.
1934536	1935116	Yes, uh-huh.
1935556	1938639	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1952553	1952834	It is.
1952934	1954855	It actually is sort of music-y, too.
1955396	1957078	But yeah, Electric Plankton's really bizarre.
1957118	1958239	I've been wanting that game for a while.
1958259	1962963	What was that one game that we were playing that was on the... Oh, God.
1963083	1963964	The other system.
1964004	1966867	The other portable system that you were hyping up.
1966887	1967287	Gizmondo.
1967687	1968448	Gizmondo, yes.
1968768	1969269	What was that game?
1969289	1970250	The guitar one.
1970330	1971331	The guitar game?
1971831	1974113	It was called Johnny Wonder, I think it was.
1974133	1974994	That was pretty cool.
1975154	1977797	It had a little karaoke mode where you sort of...
1978863	1980904	You know, hit directions and rhythm.
1981285	1985887	It was like a music and rhythm game meets an action game, which was kind of cool.
1986187	1990330	You have like an action mode where you kill things by wailing hard on your guitar.
1992251	1993572	Anyways, next one.
1993732	1994472	So one more award.
1995053	2000236	Okay, how about we do, well, without a doubt.
2000256	2005279	Again, this is coming from the show book from 1up.com's awards.
2005699	2008401	Best simulation game, Nintendogs, without a doubt.
2008661	2008941	All right.
2009121	2013682	And, yeah, you can find all this stuff on 1up.com or if you luckily have one of these things.
2013942	2020484	There's a game that they listed on here which is cool, Best PC Game Sport, which is by Will Wright, which, you know, it's going to be pretty good, I'm sure.
2020504	2025785	Speaking of PC games, I was a little disappointed that I really didn't see any Civilization IV.
2026146	2030027	I saw huge banners for it, but no place you could really go look at it.
2030067	2034968	I guess they were doing trailers and teasers, but I was really hoping I'd be able to get my hands on it.
2035308	2035728	Couldn't do it.
2036567	2037208	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2058368	2059910	I went by it towards the beginning of the show.
2060210	2060871	Totally empty.
2061051	2061571	Totally empty.
2063193	2064154	It's kind of sad.
2064214	2068498	There was more people inside the Rockstar booth than there were in the Engage Arena.
2069039	2070881	So kind of sad, but that's what happens.
2071494	2071774	DarkSakura.com
2094767	2099990	I guess with that... Oh, and our podcast, of course, is always updated late Sunday night, early Monday morning.
2100030	2101031	Check it once a week.
2101071	2102852	We will have another show in a couple days here.
2103393	2106134	Kind of, once again, wrapping it all up from E3 and taking your questions.
2106475	2110917	Just an FYI, our E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com address is now closed.
2111198	2112418	Please do not use that address.
2112458	2113179	The show's over.
2113539	2115040	Those emails will bounce back to you.
2115260	2119621	If you would like to give us feedback, though, or you want to comment on the show in general, we do still welcome those emails.
2119641	2124443	If you have E3 show feedback or you want to comment on something, we'd still love to hear from you guys.
2124743	2128104	Togo, T-O-G-O, at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2128364	2134866	And if you're a game publisher and you want to send us free stuff, that's Loki at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
2134946	2135606	Yeah, nice.
2135726	2136847	All right.
2136967	2140868	Okay, let's go around and give everybody's final thought, final E3 thought.
2140928	2141128	Loki.
2142273	2146355	That pizza I had this morning wasn't cooked all the way, and there will be hell to pay.
2146536	2147376	Hell to pay!
2149097	2154460	I had a bacon-covered wiener, and it was good, and it was cooked in onions.
2154880	2157202	So it tasted like a bacon-covered onion wiener.
2158062	2159183	And reject false icons.
2162899	2163660	Yeah, Loki, yes.
2163880	2165101	Oh, you want to be my final thought?
2165182	2175912	My final thought would be that I think it's very ironic that the ferret and the Orange Lounge Radio Media CD ended up within, like, a foot of each other on the giant Katamari.
2176213	2177734	And I wonder where they're going to roll that thing to.
2177754	2180497	I was just going to say that the Katamari claimed the ferret.
2180697	2181418	Yes, so...
2182677	2183918	It was the retard ferret, right?
2184638	2186360	No, it was the one that made all the cool sounds.
2186900	2188241	Apparently I made a mistake.
2188381	2190523	Well, I took the one that Loki had operated on.
2190943	2195246	It wasn't the one you've been using on the shows because that's still in your green chair, so don't cry.
2195647	2198529	Because the ferret is my special friend.
2199301	2201042	He's with the king of the cosmos now.
2201222	2201483	Deal.
2202623	2203044	All right.
2203864	2210569	From us here at E3 to you guys, thank you for downloading us and checking us out, subscribing to the podcast, and tuning in to our E3 coverage.
2210889	2212130	Of course, we'll be back in 2006.
2212530	2221036	And next time, watch out because we are going to be storming the booze next year with all access passes if we have anything to say about it.
2221076	2221896	We'll try.
2221996	2223958	We'll see if the woman will let me next year.
2224178	2224418	All right.
2224438	2224718	We'll see.
2224978	2225619	Goodbye, everybody.
2226633	2230197	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
2230517	2236043	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.
