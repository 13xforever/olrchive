gummy bears stronger than the average bear no actually these things are like

01:37.300 --> 01:41.600
crack I mean honestly I got to put them down because otherwise I will feel sick

01:41.600 --> 01:46.840
and cuz for some reason your body does not like five pounds of gelatin inside

01:46.840 --> 01:53.720
throwing up gummy is no fun either so I've heard anyway let's get into it we're

01:53.720 --> 01:56.840
gonna get to some gaming news but let's talk about what's going on in our gaming

01:56.840 --> 01:59.440
world lately dark Sakura what kind of games you've been playing this week

01:59.440 --> 02:07.120
Tekken 5 Tekken 5 Tekken 5 and Final Fantasy 11 how's Tekken 5 going it's

02:07.120 --> 02:12.960
awesome but Mishima Jinpachi is a bastard so really quickly tell me the

02:12.960 --> 02:16.000
best thing about Tekken 5 the worst thing about Tekken 5 well it's always

02:16.000 --> 02:22.320
been Jin. The worst thing? Jin Pachi. Somehow I knew that was gonna be your

02:22.320 --> 02:26.520
And his stupid gut fireball. Yeah, see, I would agree. I would say the best thing about

02:26.520 --> 02:30.000
Tekken 5, Anna Williams. Worst thing about Tekken 5,

02:30.000 --> 02:36.520
Jin Pachi's fireball. Cheap move, cheap. That's like stomach flatulence. And it

02:36.520 --> 02:39.520
takes off like three quarters of your life. What's up with that? And then Julia is

02:39.520 --> 02:45.520
like sucky to dodge it. Yeah. I somehow, I found the way, the best way to beat him

02:45.520 --> 02:47.280
with Julia is just keep just pounding on

02:47.280 --> 02:49.920
just keep pounding on doing it pulling

02:49.920 --> 02:52.080
off a bunch of combos on when I won but

02:52.080 --> 02:53.880
I can't play Julia the way I did on tech

02:53.880 --> 02:55.280
and three because they should just run

02:55.280 --> 02:56.880
over run over run over she doesn't do it

02:56.880 --> 02:57.400
anymore

02:57.400 --> 02:59.980
hmm not the same way she did because I

02:59.980 --> 03:02.280
am super cheesy with her but Jin I'm

03:02.280 --> 03:05.040
very happy Devil Jin has his old moves

03:05.040 --> 03:07.880
very cool happy have you played a lot of

03:07.880 --> 03:10.200
the arcade mode where you earn the

03:10.200 --> 03:11.360
points so you can customize your

03:11.360 --> 03:12.840
character that's what we've been doing

03:12.840 --> 03:18.280
Because we've got Eddie Gordo, we have Panda, um...

03:18.280 --> 03:21.480
Do you like, though, how they have... Have you played a lot of one-player arcade?

03:21.480 --> 03:25.480
Because it has, like, the made-up names that you play against, so some of them are really funny.

03:25.480 --> 03:27.800
I don't think we did that. No, we just were doing story mode.

03:27.800 --> 03:31.720
Check it out, because if you play one-player arcade, you get to play against, like, fake personalities.

03:31.720 --> 03:35.120
Like, it's a real arcade. It's really funny, some of the names. Pretty cool.

03:35.120 --> 03:41.440
I do like seeing the Roger Jr. Mokujin conversation. That was funny.

03:41.440 --> 03:44.240
Oh, Mokujin. I missed that guy. He was cool.

03:44.240 --> 03:45.440
He's in it.

03:45.440 --> 03:49.040
Is he? Oh, I just haven't unlocked him yet. I've only unlocked a couple characters.

03:49.040 --> 03:50.640
I've been playing a lot of Tekken 5 this week as well.

03:50.640 --> 03:52.240
He talks in woodblock language.

03:52.240 --> 03:55.940
You ever hear woodblocks, like in Marching Band?

03:55.940 --> 03:56.840
Yeah.

03:56.840 --> 03:57.840
That's what he sounds like.

03:57.840 --> 04:01.340
Oh, that's funny. It's cool because in Tekken they all have their native languages.

04:01.340 --> 04:02.740
That's funny that Mokujin has a...

04:02.740 --> 04:07.140
And, of course, Roger Jr. is hanging out in a mommy's pouch, speaking kangaroo.

04:07.140 --> 04:10.840
What does kangaroo sound like? Care to demonstrate?

04:10.840 --> 04:11.340
No.

04:11.340 --> 04:11.840
Alright.

04:12.840 --> 04:16.340
Um, we, Loki, what have you been up to this week in the game world?

04:16.340 --> 04:25.840
I've been playing Final Fantasy XI, and I've been playing, um, well, I tried playing some Neo Contra, but for some reason it wasn't working.

04:25.840 --> 04:34.340
And then I played, um, some actually, some arcade stuff. I played Alien vs. Predator all the way through.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.840
And, um, I also played the guy game.

04:37.840 --> 04:38.340
Yeah.

04:38.340 --> 04:42.060
You're just determined to see as many boobs as possible, aren't you?

04:42.060 --> 04:48.100
I think I've got- RAN OF PORN! It's not about the fact that there's boobs in it, that's not really

04:48.100 --> 04:48.740
the point.

04:48.740 --> 04:52.860
It's a fun party game, and the trivia is a lot of fun. It's like Trivial Pursuit

04:52.860 --> 04:53.900
with boobs, I mean...

04:53.900 --> 04:56.940
Mario Party is a fun party game. No. The guy game

04:56.940 --> 05:01.100
is boobs. It's a good trivia game, honestly, I mean, because there hasn't been a good

05:01.100 --> 05:05.220
You Don't Know Jack game for, you know, the home console system

05:05.220 --> 05:08.300
in a while, so this'll have to do.

05:08.300 --> 05:15.140
That's what I was looking for, thank you.

05:15.140 --> 05:19.740
As for me, this week I've been playing, well Tekken 5 as well, but Jamie already mentioned

05:19.740 --> 05:22.920
that, so I will mention I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, specifically

05:22.920 --> 05:24.700
Final Fantasy II.

05:24.700 --> 05:27.420
I've been trying to just get further along in that game.

05:27.420 --> 05:31.860
I decided I was going to force myself to take a break from Final Fantasy XI this week because,

05:31.860 --> 05:36.560
you know, I'm ODing on it, honestly, and it's getting stupid, so I need to take a minute

05:36.560 --> 05:41.760
to play some other games. So Final Fantasy 2, which, yeah, I go from one Final Fantasy

05:41.760 --> 05:46.280
to another, I know, big, big wow, right? But I figure, you know what, I spent the money

05:46.280 --> 05:50.360
on Dawn of Souls, I oughta, you know, check it out and play it a little more. So, cause

05:50.360 --> 05:54.840
I kinda gave up on Final Fantasy 1, cause I was like, eh, I re- I already know this

05:54.840 --> 05:58.760
from the NES, I already know this story, you know, the graphics, okay, I'm done with that

05:58.760 --> 06:03.180
now. But Final Fantasy 2, it's still very fresh to me. I never really got into it, even

06:03.180 --> 06:07.240
when it was translated and out in ROM form on the internet years ago I never

06:07.240 --> 06:11.300
really got into it so now I'm kind of getting into it and it's kind of cool so

06:11.300 --> 06:16.180
that's kind of what I also got to mention the guy game I got one point the

06:16.180 --> 06:20.600
end the game I got zero points because I bet on the wrong girl to win the the guy

06:20.600 --> 06:27.500
check the yeah the guy challenge I guess is what it was where basically they have

06:27.500 --> 06:31.460
to do something stupid topless or whatever so I got it wrong so they

06:31.460 --> 06:35.360
rewards you with some crew member that's some big fat hairy guy that was doing

06:35.360 --> 06:42.380
like sultry stuff and I thought that was very hilarious whatever all right let's

06:42.380 --> 06:45.760
get into some video game news some stuff that's actually going on out there this

06:45.760 --> 06:50.900
week um big news Metal Gear Solid 4 is confirmed it is going to be happening

06:50.900 --> 06:54.340
there was a press event in Berlin to celebrate the release of Metal Gear

06:54.340 --> 06:59.260
Solid 3 Snake Eater in Europe the next game in the Metal Gear Solid series was

06:59.260 --> 07:04.460
confirmed. Although Hideo Kojima always said that Metal Gear was kind of gonna

07:04.460 --> 07:09.180
be a trilogy, of course these games sell very well and they're going to live on.

07:09.180 --> 07:14.220
It's just that Hideo Kojima is gonna step aside in this one. He's just going

07:14.220 --> 07:18.700
to be executive producer. This time Kenichiro Imazumi is going to be

07:18.700 --> 07:22.580
taking over as the title's producer, so we can expect some new things to come

07:22.580 --> 07:26.900
out of Metal Gear. So you're a Metal Gear fan, right? So what do you think about

07:26.900 --> 07:30.820
Hideo Kojima stepping aside you think it's gonna be you know fresh look for

07:30.820 --> 07:34.100
the series he's still gonna have control over the basic elements not gonna let

07:34.100 --> 07:38.840
anything go outside his vision so long as he's executive producer say I don't

07:38.840 --> 07:42.980
feel like producing your stupid idea yeah I think I think it's gonna I think

07:42.980 --> 07:46.860
things will be okay I think it's it's kind of not a big surprise we were

07:46.860 --> 07:51.780
talking about this on outside the box on Thursday night and you know Kojima it

07:51.780 --> 07:55.260
was kind of this next he's been threatening to do it for a while so it's

07:55.260 --> 07:59.260
not a big surprise. Well, look at a perfect example would be look at the Silent Hill series.

07:59.260 --> 08:03.260
I mean, I don't remember the original creator of it, but then you have Akira Yamaoka

08:03.260 --> 08:07.260
stepping up to actually write the series

08:07.260 --> 08:11.260
three and four, whereas someone else is doing

08:11.260 --> 08:15.260
one and two, and he was just doing the music for it. So, it could be a good thing.

08:15.260 --> 08:19.260
I think it is a good thing, actually, because, I mean, he's probably

08:19.260 --> 08:23.260
run out of, not really run out of ideas, but you know, having some

08:23.260 --> 08:28.800
know actual someone else helping to create this it'll be a little bit better

08:28.800 --> 08:33.160
because you know some fresh new ideas can come from it and obviously since

08:33.160 --> 08:37.240
he's still executive producer of it you know it's not gonna just turn into

08:37.240 --> 08:43.360
something awful like that you might see in I don't know a video game movie all

08:43.360 --> 08:45.720
right so we'll see what happens with that I'm looking forward to seeing more

08:45.720 --> 08:53.240
stuff on Metal Gear Solid 4 it needs to have like Dave snake again

08:53.240 --> 09:00.960
I always call the the current solids I always call solids make Dave snake if you ever played through the first Metal Gear Solid

09:01.800 --> 09:06.260
Metal Gear Solid or games I've watched and not played a whole lot of play them a little bit

09:06.260 --> 09:08.860
But not a whole lot Metal Gear Solid 3 was all about big boss

09:09.680 --> 09:13.560
Nothing will trump the original Metal Gear for me the truck have started to move

09:14.920 --> 09:18.940
Now did they mention which console this is gonna come out next-gen probably

09:18.940 --> 09:26.940
I believe it was next-gen. I don't remember. I don't have the story in front of me anymore, but I think it was next-gen.

09:26.940 --> 09:32.940
If I'm wrong, I'm wrong. If you ever want to give feedback, by the way, if you want to yell at us for being wrong or whatever,

09:32.940 --> 09:37.940
you just want to say hello, hi, how you doing, our email address togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

09:37.940 --> 09:42.940
We'd love to answer some viewer mail in the podcast. We haven't gotten anything really appropriate for that yet,

09:42.940 --> 09:48.240
So something to think about if you have a question you'd like us to address on the podcast send it over to go at orange

09:48.240 --> 09:50.240
not ready to calm

09:50.500 --> 09:55.060
ESRB the entertainment software rating board they have introduced a brand new rating

09:55.060 --> 10:00.280
You know how games are rated very similar to movies. They have ratings such as childhood EC

10:00.820 --> 10:01.900
everyone e

10:01.900 --> 10:08.620
Teen T mature am a very rare adults only but you probably see that in the guy game

10:08.620 --> 10:13.140
Okay, but now they've got a brand new rating, they just unveiled a new rating, it's called

10:13.140 --> 10:16.100
E10 Plus.

10:16.100 --> 10:20.860
It's gonna categorize those games that may not be necessarily family-friendly, but they're

10:20.860 --> 10:24.780
not quite really worthy of a T rating as well.

10:24.780 --> 10:29.540
So Donkey Kong Jungle Beat would be an example of a game that would get like an E10 Plus

10:29.540 --> 10:35.880
rating because it's kinda not really for everybody per se, but it's not really a game that needs

10:35.880 --> 10:37.380
to be teen rated either.

10:37.380 --> 10:39.380
So, thoughts on that?

10:39.380 --> 10:41.380
It's called They Should Rate It.

10:41.380 --> 10:43.380
Parents, do your research!

10:43.380 --> 10:47.380
Do your job.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.380
Do you think the rating system does its job?

10:50.380 --> 10:58.380
The only good that comes of it is giving an overall indicator, so that if a parent actually feels like doing their job, they can look at the game and get an idea.

10:58.380 --> 11:04.140
where's the rating that's if you're under 17 and you buy this we're going to

11:04.140 --> 11:11.580
see the pants off you or or like this game may cause you to go murder someone

11:11.580 --> 11:16.580
I suppose it's only a matter of time but it kind of ties into another story

11:16.580 --> 11:20.320
that's going on out there which I think is interesting in Arkansas this week

11:20.320 --> 11:24.740
state senator Shawn Womack he's created a bill and what it's going to do is any

11:24.740 --> 11:29.460
retail place, like a shop or whatever, that wants to sell an M-rated game, they

11:29.460 --> 11:34.860
have to display them at least five feet from the floor. Okay, the bill was

11:34.860 --> 11:38.360
introduced March 3rd, and what it would do is it would allow the Arkansas

11:38.360 --> 11:43.420
Department of Public Health to fine any store caught doing this up to $500 each

11:43.420 --> 11:47.660
time they violate the law. So you have to keep M-rated games at least five feet

11:47.660 --> 11:51.940
from the floor so children can't reach them. Good idea, bad idea? Retarded idea.

11:51.940 --> 12:00.580
why it's just a way for them to make money you know first of all it's not

12:00.580 --> 12:03.500
necessarily going to be the stores fault having gone into my fiance's store

12:03.500 --> 12:07.580
plenty of times I see where someone will pick up a game walk around the store

12:07.580 --> 12:12.380
with it and put it on the bottom shelf you know there shouldn't be any reason

12:12.380 --> 12:15.260
that the store should be held accountable for some other poor idiots

12:15.260 --> 12:22.280
you know this yeah this is retarded for example sir I cannot reach the game on

12:22.280 --> 12:25.560
the high shelf can you please get it down for me up there you go got the game

12:25.560 --> 12:30.040
that doesn't stop anyone it's discrimination against short people tall

12:30.040 --> 12:35.760
children it's midget discriminates poor midgets is no one thinking of the midget

12:35.760 --> 12:41.240
gamer and there are very many children midgets want Grand Theft Auto 2 what the

12:41.240 --> 12:46.540
hell and what them what does it matter that they can reach the game the person

12:46.540 --> 12:49.780
that's behind the counter shouldn't be selling the mature game to them anyways

12:49.780 --> 12:53.420
what's it matter the parents should be giving the kids the money by the game

12:53.420 --> 13:00.620
great I was just under five feet and I could reach up and grab something

13:00.620 --> 13:07.940
retarded hello does the senator no idea to be honest here okay violent games I

13:07.940 --> 13:14.940
I don't even see how these can be even close to being equal to like violent movies or violent

13:14.940 --> 13:16.260
TV.

13:16.260 --> 13:17.940
It's just completely like two different things.

13:17.940 --> 13:21.220
They'd be like depicting a piece of art with blood in it.

13:21.220 --> 13:24.300
Oh my God.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.540
It's just really sad.

13:25.540 --> 13:30.380
Well, it doesn't stop there, you guys, because also coming out on the Newswire this week,

13:30.380 --> 13:37.080
three Washington state representatives, Jim McCune, Jim McDermott, and Mary Lou Dickerson,

13:37.080 --> 13:43.060
They co-authored a bill that will hold game companies responsible if a minor commits a

13:43.060 --> 13:47.820
violent act that is seemingly inspired by a video game they played.

13:47.820 --> 13:49.800
That's even more stupid.

13:49.800 --> 13:51.740
That's not fair.

13:51.740 --> 13:53.980
That's just straight up not fair.

13:53.980 --> 13:58.100
They're trying to find a scapegoat because parents don't want to take any responsibility

13:58.100 --> 13:59.540
for what their children do.

13:59.540 --> 14:04.860
The reason why their children are acting this way is because it's their own damn fault.

14:04.860 --> 14:09.780
And I would freakin' pay to have a press conference to announce to all these parents that they're

14:09.780 --> 14:10.780
idiots.

14:10.780 --> 14:13.260
Well, you got the podcast.

14:13.260 --> 14:14.260
Here's your forum.

14:14.260 --> 14:17.620
Parents of America, do your goddamn job.

14:17.620 --> 14:22.480
If your child is a little hellion, spank them.

14:22.480 --> 14:27.980
You know what's wrong with this whole, the United States, is the goddamn balls have left

14:27.980 --> 14:29.860
the judicial system.

14:29.860 --> 14:33.820
Where are the judges out there that go, when these people go, yeah, my kid killed this

14:33.820 --> 14:38.620
kid and he learned it in Grand Theft Auto maybe he learned it because you're a bad

14:38.620 --> 14:43.100
parent I'll tell you what she's on TV every night at seven o'clock judge Judy

14:43.100 --> 14:51.980
thank you watch the news watch the fucking news watch fucking CNN and so

14:51.980 --> 14:58.880
and so killed so-and-so and kids thinking huh I have violent tendencies I want to

14:58.880 --> 15:04.660
on the news it's just ridiculous you know what next thing you're gonna have

15:04.660 --> 15:09.060
al-qaeda suing Microsoft because they learn to fly airplanes in the buildings

15:09.060 --> 15:14.420
from Microsoft flight simulator it's all Microsoft's fault it's always

15:14.420 --> 15:18.140
Microsoft's fault but that's another story okay it doesn't stop there you

15:18.140 --> 15:22.820
guys it doesn't stop there um tonight actually or I should say the night we

15:22.820 --> 15:27.620
tape podcast Sunday Sunday night actually it aired on 60 minutes on March

15:27.620 --> 15:31.340
6th so I'm sure you're gonna be hearing about it more this week as it goes on so

15:31.340 --> 15:35.180
we'll probably follow up with this 60 minutes was going to be airing a segment

15:35.180 --> 15:40.280
and it has to do with the battle between the families of a slain Alabama police

15:40.280 --> 15:43.780
officer I'm sorry actually multiple Alabama police officers and the makers

15:43.780 --> 15:47.580
and the sellers of the Grand Theft Auto franchise because there was a lawsuit

15:47.580 --> 15:52.100
that was sparked by the deaths of three Alabama police officers who were killed

15:52.100 --> 15:57.660
by a teen who said he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto.

15:57.660 --> 15:58.660
Talk about scapegoat.

15:58.660 --> 16:00.660
The game made me do it, mommy!

16:00.660 --> 16:06.100
That's because mommy facilitated him having the game if she was doing her game.

16:06.100 --> 16:10.820
There were plenty of times I wanted games, and my momma wouldn't buy them for me.

16:10.820 --> 16:12.400
Here's the interesting thing.

16:12.400 --> 16:20.200
The arrest of Devin Moore, who is allegedly responsible for the crime, 18 years old.

16:20.200 --> 16:27.880
hangable fucking hang him more allegedly said life's like a video game

16:27.880 --> 16:33.800
you've got to die sometime no I'm sorry games like Grand Theft Auto do not teach

16:33.800 --> 16:38.360
you how to kill games like area 51 teach you how to kill that gives you fucking

16:38.360 --> 16:42.240
you know hand-eye coordination and you get better aim playing some games like

16:42.240 --> 16:46.240
that that's the type of games I'll teach you how to kill is a game like time

16:46.240 --> 16:51.620
crisis or gun game like that. Grand Theft Auto, I push a button and it fires a gun.

16:51.620 --> 16:55.280
I can't just go up and walk up and open a door and throw someone out of a car. That's

16:55.280 --> 17:00.240
not how you go and jack a car. It's not that easy. Trust me, if it was that easy, it would

17:00.240 --> 17:04.840
be happening a lot more often. That David Chappelle skit illustrated it perfectly.

17:04.840 --> 17:09.960
Exactly. It's ridiculous. And to be honest, I mean, you can't even compare them. It's

17:09.960 --> 17:15.580
a fucking game. It's a simulator. Like playing, for example, if I were to play Pilot Wings,

17:15.580 --> 17:17.960
I can't fly a plane, okay?

17:17.960 --> 17:21.520
I can't fly a plane if I'm, you know, playing, you know, a NASCAR game.

17:21.520 --> 17:24.260
I can't race a NASCAR, okay?

17:24.260 --> 17:25.260
If I'm, you know...

17:25.260 --> 17:27.220
Hey, Ridge Racer taught me how to drive.

17:27.220 --> 17:31.440
Okay, if I'm playing Star Wars, I can't fly a space shuttle, okay?

17:31.440 --> 17:33.200
This is, this is the whole point.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.380
Playing DDR doesn't teach me how to dance.

17:36.380 --> 17:37.380
That's for sure.

17:37.380 --> 17:40.360
Playing Karaoke Revolution doesn't make me any better at singing.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.720
Well, maybe a little bit, but not necessarily.

17:43.720 --> 17:44.720
This is the whole point.

17:44.720 --> 17:50.280
Games do not teach you much, they help you improve hand-eye coordination, but you don't

17:50.280 --> 17:51.480
really learn much from them.

17:51.480 --> 17:57.440
I'm gonna sue the makers of Monopoly because I got a bad real estate deal, and it's because

17:57.440 --> 17:58.440
of Monopoly.

17:58.440 --> 18:04.000
I'm gonna sue Parker Brothers for the game of life, because, dammit, I'm not married

18:04.000 --> 18:10.780
and have six children, and I didn't start my life with $20,000.

18:10.780 --> 18:16.240
They totally gave me false hope, although the six children part would really suck ass.

18:16.240 --> 18:17.240
It's like, you know, really...

18:17.240 --> 18:20.420
That'd be a bitch of a mom.

18:20.420 --> 18:25.420
It comes down to, just the whole society out there is just not wanting to take responsibility

18:25.420 --> 18:26.420
for anything.

18:26.420 --> 18:30.100
I'm going to sue the Game of Life for not allowing me to have two blue pegs in the front

18:30.100 --> 18:33.940
of the car, per the instruction manual, and I get called on that too, and that makes me

18:33.940 --> 18:34.940
upset.

18:34.940 --> 18:38.800
Dude, the Game of Life came out a long time ago when that was, like, not hot.

18:38.800 --> 18:40.680
It's not okay!

18:40.680 --> 18:48.840
because it's old doesn't make it right okay I'm serious I'm not I'm being a

18:48.840 --> 18:54.120
little silly here but honestly if we can sue the video game why can't I sue metal

18:54.120 --> 18:58.280
you're solid three snake eater just because I play the game does not mean I

18:58.280 --> 19:10.440
can survive in Vietnam it also does not mean that I can eat snakes

19:10.440 --> 19:13.280
Or tree frogs anyway, let's move on

19:14.680 --> 19:21.560
What a lovely way to follow this up since dark Sakura is talking about, you know parents be responsible for your kids

19:21.720 --> 19:28.240
Here is how a segment for us to give back to the community and dark Sakura is gonna let you know how to better your

19:28.240 --> 19:31.800
Life we call this segment dark Sakura's advice column

19:33.160 --> 19:38.840
And what are you gonna be giving us advice on tonight dark Sakura today's advice is how to escape if trapped in the lion

19:38.840 --> 19:42.780
Oh, this is good number one, but do not run

19:43.780 --> 19:47.100
What where would you run to you're in it's cut like you're in a cage

19:49.380 --> 19:55.460
Number two watch for signs of an attack a low staccato growl combined with eye contact and a lashing tail

19:55.760 --> 20:00.760
Usually indicate further attack is likely number three find a defensive tool

20:01.260 --> 20:07.020
Moving very slowly picking up anything within reach a water bowl bench or anything else that may be used to fend off the charge

20:07.020 --> 20:09.020
4. Back away slowly.

20:09.020 --> 20:16.020
5. Watch for mock charges. A land may make several mock charges before actually attacking.

20:16.020 --> 20:18.020
It will run forward then stop.

20:18.020 --> 20:21.020
Mock charging shows that a real attack is imminent.

20:21.020 --> 20:25.020
6. Yell. Yell as loudly as you can.

20:25.020 --> 20:28.020
Lands are sensitive to noise yelling may discourage further charges.

20:30.020 --> 20:35.020
7. Bend off the attack. Push his paws and head away from you with a nearby object.

20:35.020 --> 20:41.660
8 keep screaming as loudly as possible you know what my thing is huh don't

20:41.660 --> 20:48.160
fucking get caught in the cage just because I played the Lion King game does

20:48.160 --> 20:52.900
not mean I could survive a lion just just because I played zookeeper does not

20:52.900 --> 21:00.780
mean I can moving on let's I think we definitely need to get to a different

21:00.780 --> 21:05.400
topic so let's talk about another industry that ruins people's lives let's

21:05.400 --> 21:09.680
talk about Hollywood for a minute here because you know we love it when

21:09.680 --> 21:16.500
Hollywood and video games cross paths the rock you know the rock from the WWE

21:16.500 --> 21:21.480
right all right well what the rocks cooking up now is that he is spilling

21:21.480 --> 21:24.780
the beans on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart he was on there this week

21:24.780 --> 21:28.680
promoting the film be cool and he spilled the beans that he just finished

21:28.680 --> 21:37.860
shooting a movie called doom oh shit and when asked if the WWE wrestler played a

21:37.860 --> 21:44.900
creature the rock responded no I'm the one as you know which at least the one

21:44.900 --> 21:53.420
no cataracts is the one I'm confused too many words can't he be via like 11 then

21:53.420 --> 22:00.540
he's I want to now who knows if it is if he is the main guy or not because

22:00.540 --> 22:04.020
supposedly some sites are saying that he's playing this character that says

22:04.020 --> 22:09.900
Sarge and the rock was quoted earlier by Empire online by saying without giving

22:09.900 --> 22:13.820
the movie away I play the ultimate blank it'll be great but you don't know I'm

22:13.820 --> 22:18.300
blank the blank parts being censored so who knows what the hell he's doing in

22:18.300 --> 22:22.860
this movie but he's involved with the doom movie and it'll be interesting to

22:22.860 --> 22:28.940
see if that movie is decent like the game or total crap like Alone in the

22:28.940 --> 22:34.740
Dark is you and bull I do not think he's directing it okay thank God there is

22:34.740 --> 22:40.460
hope there's one point to it oh man that guy does not need I just got

22:40.460 --> 22:44.720
Alone in the Dark the other day I got my screening copy from work I still have

22:44.720 --> 22:47.620
yet to watch it cuz my friend is borrowing this weekend to see how bad it

22:47.620 --> 22:53.580
I will come back give my full review on that later on. I'm scared because oh

22:54.500 --> 23:01.960
Man, it's just it's bad, but honestly the rock I think he's gonna be pretty good because he was pretty funny and be cool

23:01.960 --> 23:06.900
At least from the trailers. I've seen he's pretty versatile. He wants to go in the acting career

23:06.900 --> 23:11.460
It looks like and I could see him as like an action star. He was good in the rundown. So I

23:11.460 --> 23:16.500
I'd be willing to give it to him other than like Vin Diesel or he wants to fill

23:16.500 --> 23:21.660
Schwarzenegger's shoes so very badly well actually long as he never runs for

23:21.660 --> 23:25.420
governor well actually if you've ever seen the rundown there was sort of a

23:25.420 --> 23:29.100
passing the torch in that movie where Arnold had a cameo and you know

23:29.100 --> 23:33.140
basically you know I don't know I didn't remember I've never actually seen the

23:33.140 --> 23:39.660
rundown but you know it looked good and my dad said is awesome but yeah did you

23:39.660 --> 23:43.780
know the rock is related to Ricky she and but they're related to the late

23:43.780 --> 23:48.380
Yokozuna I did not know that yeah you do know who would be a better role though

23:48.380 --> 23:55.180
for doom Oh Colgan he needs to do something Oh Colgan man give me a movie

23:55.180 --> 23:59.860
please Oh Colgan needs he needs work he needs work more than you know his

23:59.860 --> 24:04.460
daughter doesn't even work well actually Hulk Hogan's gonna be a reality show I

24:04.460 --> 24:09.140
heard this Lord it's gonna be following him around him and his daughter and it's

24:09.140 --> 24:15.100
gonna be like life as a celebrity or after being celebrity or it's supposed

24:15.100 --> 24:19.700
to be coming on TV. I'm just glad he retired from wrestling. But Hulk Hogan, he needs more work because

24:19.700 --> 24:23.980
goddamn it he's funny you can put him in like something ridiculous like suburban

24:23.980 --> 24:27.660
commando and you know that movie is so bad but still you can watch it and enjoy

24:27.660 --> 24:31.740
it that's the whole point it's it's fun it doesn't have to be good to be fun. Mr. Nanny.

24:31.740 --> 24:36.540
Fun movies people are losing it they're like they they want to concentrate on

24:36.540 --> 24:43.860
whether movie is good or bad just be fun fun movie all right let's let's move on

24:43.860 --> 24:49.220
to another story here this is the biggest duh not a surprise of the year

24:49.220 --> 24:57.540
Nintendo DS is getting brand new colors in Japan granted right now but it's only

24:57.540 --> 25:01.340
a matter of time kids as far as I'm concerned what colors are gonna be

25:01.340 --> 25:07.340
happening graphite black pure white are gonna hit the streets on March 24th and

25:07.340 --> 25:15.620
on April 21st the DS will come out in turquoise blue and candy pink and no

25:15.620 --> 25:21.860
graphite black one no price increase for this it's cost the same as the standard

25:21.860 --> 25:25.300
colored DS but this is the biggest Nintendo always does this this is no

25:25.300 --> 25:29.340
surprise how many times can you buy the Gameboy before you get tired that's what

25:29.340 --> 25:36.380
I need to know I guess what folks also coming out soon because the DS is not the replacement for the Gameboy the Gameboy Advance 2

25:36.380 --> 25:40.920
That's right. They're working on Gameboy Advance 2 the DS is its own little entity

25:41.020 --> 25:44.060
We've got our thing down there for the great game shooter

25:44.060 --> 25:49.220
So it's great though is you know you have the DS with hardly any games and now when the Gameboy Advance 2 comes out

25:49.220 --> 25:52.940
There won't be any games. This is gonna die off like the freaking I

25:53.540 --> 25:55.460
Don't know Jaguar

25:55.460 --> 26:01.420
Out of curiosity is anyone here gonna pick up a PSP on our launch? I've got one reserved sounds good the great game launcher

26:01.420 --> 26:05.420
I'm on the fence it kind of depends because I have things going on in my personal life

26:05.420 --> 26:08.420
I have to pay for and that's quite a bit of an investment, so if I have

26:08.980 --> 26:10.980
Extra money I want to go

26:14.860 --> 26:17.780
This isn't totally about video games

26:17.780 --> 26:20.620
But then I think about I go around at work

26:20.620 --> 26:25.660
and I constantly see people that should be working playing on Yahoo games and so

26:25.660 --> 26:29.540
it kind of makes me think that Yahoo games kind of has a pretty decent impact

26:29.540 --> 26:33.460
on the gaming world or the people around your slackers well that too but I

26:33.460 --> 26:36.860
thought this was worth mentioning Yahoo is actually going to be breaking into

26:36.860 --> 26:42.900
the mobile game area now Yahoo announced that is launched its own game

26:42.900 --> 26:47.620
development studio because it acquired stadion Inc another development studio

26:47.620 --> 26:53.180
and they're going to have this new studio yahoo game studio it already has

26:53.180 --> 26:56.260
of course you know the free multiplayer card and board games they have on their

26:56.260 --> 27:01.820
site now they have they're going to be working on mobile phone games so this

27:01.820 --> 27:05.180
should be interesting another way to waste your time you have to me yahoo

27:05.180 --> 27:08.320
has some pretty addicting games on it every games but you got to admit also

27:08.320 --> 27:13.700
mobile phone games are way overpriced way overpriced true but it's interesting

27:13.700 --> 27:18.220
to see the mobile game world kind of expanding and not just the engage but

27:18.220 --> 27:23.300
you know because they're still going with the engage they won't let that go

27:23.300 --> 27:27.020
I remember the press release they're still they're still working on the engage

27:27.020 --> 27:30.980
like we're not done with the engage yet I'm like yes you are well we're all

27:30.980 --> 27:36.700
past it why can't you get past it there's every serious gamer has said bye

27:36.700 --> 27:42.500
I did the Engage a long time ago but let it go there is a time when they need to

27:42.500 --> 27:49.740
learn to let go I can't wait to see the Engage tent again this year one of our

27:49.740 --> 27:54.020
favorite companies Square Enix Square Enix how everyone say it or as we say

27:54.020 --> 28:01.620
it's Queen X they have the president Yoichi Wada said said an interesting

28:01.620 --> 28:07.300
quote I think that over half our income and profit will be based on network

28:07.300 --> 28:14.260
content including games by 2008 or 2009 so it's very interesting they're kind of

28:14.260 --> 28:18.940
gonna probably be some seeing some more expansion into online gaming as we go on

28:18.940 --> 28:23.100
through the years think that's probably pretty accurate I mean that's kind of a

28:23.100 --> 28:27.620
you know general feel of how the industry is going but I don't know I see

28:27.620 --> 28:32.700
internet's becoming like cable where everyone has it so why not embrace the

28:32.700 --> 28:36.500
future don't worry though they're not gonna let the platformers go you of

28:36.500 --> 28:40.660
course you got Final Fantasy 12 and Kingdom Hearts 2 both not online games

28:40.660 --> 28:45.940
they are their own standalone titles they're gonna be out there as well just

28:45.940 --> 28:49.220
to you know because then they're gonna be huge titles as well and they both

28:49.220 --> 28:55.900
come out yeah and besides where's my new copy of her gets home or guides or

28:55.900 --> 28:59.520
whatever it is. We broke that out the other day and started playing it. I love

28:59.520 --> 29:04.780
that game. I need to bring Ein Honda over. I remember when I first saw Urgeitz in

29:04.780 --> 29:08.820
was it Circus Circus played in the arcade and I thought it was the coolest

29:08.820 --> 29:14.020
thing ever. Alright one more story for you guys tonight and this one's for

29:14.020 --> 29:18.620
Loki because I saw him post about this game on his live journal and I just I

29:18.620 --> 29:22.900
knew I wanted to share this news Nintendo is letting the dogs out on

29:22.900 --> 29:29.240
On April 21st, there's a brand new game coming out, it's called Nintendogs, that's coming

29:29.240 --> 29:35.660
out in Japan on April 21st, however, it's going to be called Nintendogs in America,

29:35.660 --> 29:41.540
I'm sorry, Nintendogs in America is going to be called Puppy Times, that's the working

29:41.540 --> 29:44.940
title anyway, but they are going to release it in America.

29:44.940 --> 29:45.940
When?

29:45.940 --> 29:46.940
When?

29:46.940 --> 29:51.040
No date announced yet, but there's supposedly going to be three packages, there's Shiba

29:51.040 --> 29:55.760
and Friends, Miniature Dashun and Friends, and Chihuahua and Friends.

29:55.760 --> 30:01.400
Dachshund? Yeah, sorry, whatever. I'm not a dog person. I want kitty and friends.

30:01.400 --> 30:05.880
Where's my kitty and friends? You know, I can't wait because I don't even know why

30:05.880 --> 30:10.160
I'd want this. Probably because I'm sad that there's no other games for the DS.

30:10.160 --> 30:12.480
Well, let me tell you what you can do with this. You can you can use the

30:12.480 --> 30:15.600
touchscreen pad. You can call out the puppy's name by yelling in the

30:15.600 --> 30:20.420
microphone. You can yell, stay, sit. There's over a hundred and fifty items that you

30:20.420 --> 30:28.820
can use to entertain the dogs with interesting huh sounds cool I'll have to

30:28.820 --> 30:33.060
get it because my fiance won't let me have a dog because she's afraid of dogs

30:33.060 --> 30:36.860
so here's the other interesting thing about it there's gonna be the three

30:36.860 --> 30:39.960
different packages and they each have five different puppies in it you can

30:39.960 --> 30:44.300
unlock the remaining ten puppies that aren't available by default in your

30:44.300 --> 30:49.020
cartridge by playing the game and communicating with other owners of the

30:49.020 --> 30:53.720
game like a virtual dog park so that's all going to be using the wireless mode

30:53.720 --> 30:58.080
so it's going to be interesting to see the puppy times using the wireless mode

30:58.080 --> 31:05.120
I also have this game by the way the the virtual dogs and everything will work

31:05.120 --> 31:12.720
even when the DS is in sleep mode that's kind of cool all right that's going to

31:12.720 --> 31:16.800
