[SPEAKER_02]: That is the motto of Orange Lounge Radio, by the way.

04:19.850 --> 04:20.630

04:24.693 --> 04:26.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least we're going to try.

04:27.795 --> 04:29.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Some actual Bomani news to talk about.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.578

12:55.419 --> 12:57.821
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

12:57.861 --> 12:59.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoyed that break of night style.

12:59.602 --> 13:12.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting it off with a little bit of fun by Mr. T. Karma, Taku, Starfield by Sara, and Rick being remixed by Hisashi and Nawata with Rizlum, the remix there.

[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoyed that.

13:15.615 --> 13:16.876
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if you're Jamie, you didn't enjoy that.

13:16.916 --> 13:17.217
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

13:18.137 --> 13:21.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot What is your problem with Night Style anyway?

13:21.339 --> 13:34.187
[SPEAKER_08]: I love Night Style Stupid timing bullshit Which I hope they fixed in the home version We will find out very soon I'm gonna order mine just so I can have it I'm still missing 4th Style though Yeah Oh man You know what?

13:34.247 --> 13:46.254
[SPEAKER_02]: Night Style actually brought a lot of songs over from 4th Style In their return songs Like Empathy, hello Like one of the best Taku songs ever They brought back for Night Style That makes me happy Empathy pisses me off But I love Empathy It still pisses me off You shut your mouth

13:48.856 --> 13:52.659
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next break I will do some forest style music just to make you happy what?

13:56.962 --> 14:11.492
[SPEAKER_08]: oh my god I finally did the little flash game on the grudge site and it's kind of spooky speaking of Japanese movies that became American movies did you get a chance to go see Ring 2 yet?

14:12.152 --> 14:13.233
[SPEAKER_02]: no I hear it's crap

14:14.008 --> 14:17.429
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me sad, because the first one is seriously one of the greatest horror movies.

14:17.449 --> 14:19.390
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it hardly deviated from the original.

14:20.690 --> 14:22.891
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go see it, but I'm still waiting for Darkwater.

14:24.391 --> 14:26.952
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to buy the book first.

14:27.612 --> 14:29.853
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so happy, because Loop is going to be out soon.

14:30.273 --> 14:30.513
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

14:31.154 --> 14:36.735
[SPEAKER_08]: Loop is the third book in the Ring series, which, if you read the books, it goes in a completely different direction.

14:36.835 --> 14:41.377
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, from watching the trailers of Ring 2, it sort of seems like a tie-in, almost.

14:41.557 --> 14:41.697
[SPEAKER_18]: Hmm.

14:42.401 --> 14:43.542
[SPEAKER_08]: I am smart, S-M-R-T, smart

15:07.955 --> 15:11.078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got you the Harry Potter book and you never read it.

15:11.218 --> 15:12.840
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, now wait a minute.

15:12.980 --> 15:14.081
[SPEAKER_02]: I read two chapters.

15:14.441 --> 15:14.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a break.

15:15.002 --> 15:16.463
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not, no.

15:17.844 --> 15:19.846
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I do want to read Harry Potter someday.

15:19.866 --> 15:20.947
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... You can read.

15:23.970 --> 15:26.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, starting off... Up, up, up, up, up, up.

15:26.412 --> 15:28.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:28.815 --> 15:30.016
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off tonight's show...

15:31.812 --> 15:32.372
[SPEAKER_02]: L-Mullet Honorary

15:57.800 --> 15:58.362
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

15:58.402 --> 15:59.163
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, who cares, right?

15:59.183 --> 15:59.804
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

16:00.065 --> 16:04.934
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taking the first step in becoming a legitimate business operation.

16:10.184 --> 16:12.165
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have our paparazzi.

16:28.935 --> 16:33.118
[SPEAKER_02]: and we decided, you know, we ought to actually settle these things with like a DDR match.

16:33.839 --> 16:35.960
[SPEAKER_25]: I was about to say that too.

16:37.101 --> 16:41.244
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had suggested a cream corn wrestling cage match.

16:41.464 --> 16:42.565
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's chess, I'll win.

16:43.926 --> 16:44.627
[SPEAKER_02]: He totally will win.

16:44.667 --> 16:45.287
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at chess.

16:45.327 --> 16:45.648
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm horrible.

16:46.048 --> 16:49.570
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so we're officially on our way.

16:49.831 --> 16:56.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you know that means because we are officially becoming a business you can expect pop-ups to be coming to the site effective tomorrow.

16:56.616 --> 16:56.996
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

16:57.472 --> 16:59.613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, we will not be having pop-up ads on the site.

16:59.973 --> 17:00.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop-up ads are evil.

17:01.494 --> 17:04.595
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of you guys have them blocked anyway, so what good would it do anyway?

17:05.756 --> 17:07.997
[SPEAKER_02]: So, congratulations to us.

17:08.577 --> 17:08.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Whee!

17:09.778 --> 17:10.038
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

17:10.338 --> 17:16.080
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would like to send a cash congratulations, a cash notice or a cash thank you, like I was telling you.

17:16.541 --> 17:24.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just send that to... You can address those care of Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and I'll make sure those get forwarded appropriately.

17:26.065 --> 17:26.345
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

17:28.504 --> 17:31.805
[SPEAKER_02]: And now for the El Mullet Honorary How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day segment.

17:33.025 --> 17:35.885
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit about us and how our day is going.

17:36.145 --> 17:36.605
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked.

17:36.725 --> 17:37.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

17:37.426 --> 17:37.786
[SPEAKER_08]: I worked.

17:37.846 --> 17:38.466
[SPEAKER_08]: I went to school.

17:38.686 --> 17:39.006
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

17:39.346 --> 17:40.386
[SPEAKER_08]: I exercised a lot.

17:40.506 --> 17:40.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay.

17:41.846 --> 17:48.487
[SPEAKER_08]: Um... I actually, though, I was all nervous about my Photoshop assignment and then I found that he postponed it another two weeks.

17:49.848 --> 17:51.368
[SPEAKER_08]: Excuse me, and I just burped.

17:51.788 --> 17:52.468
[SPEAKER_08]: Nacho burp.

17:53.248 --> 17:56.909
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, um... It was... It was very cool.

17:57.169 --> 17:57.249
[SPEAKER_08]: Um...

17:59.378 --> 18:03.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Yesterday I hung out with Tia and some of her friends.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.460
[SPEAKER_08]: And I went to Curves.

18:06.620 --> 18:07.781
[SPEAKER_08]: I had never been before.

18:07.901 --> 18:10.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Curves the place that plays Jesus music while you work out?

18:11.002 --> 18:12.863
[SPEAKER_08]: No, they play like dance music.

18:13.203 --> 18:15.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I heard they play Jesus music.

18:15.784 --> 18:17.204
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's why my mom stopped going.

18:17.964 --> 18:19.065
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is the one downtown.

18:19.565 --> 18:20.905
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well I guess maybe it's different.

18:20.925 --> 18:25.107
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on which one you go to because I think they're sort of, I think they're franchised.

18:25.767 --> 18:26.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well maybe that's it then.

18:26.947 --> 18:28.268
[SPEAKER_08]: But this one was downtown.

18:29.355 --> 18:30.235
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of neat.

18:30.796 --> 18:34.797
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't, you know, the exercise I need, but I still got a workout out of it.

18:35.757 --> 18:42.139
[SPEAKER_08]: But it uses resistance machines and then these bouncy things that you hop up and down on in between doing the resistance machines.

18:42.159 --> 18:46.201
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're only doing this like 15, 30 seconds each time.

18:46.741 --> 18:50.342
[SPEAKER_08]: But as you go through a couple of circuits of it, you're like, ooh, tired.

18:51.422 --> 18:54.103
[SPEAKER_08]: But it wasn't really, I was tired but not like fatigued.

18:54.363 --> 18:55.184
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like I'm supposed to be.

18:55.604 --> 18:56.224
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't hurt.

18:57.344 --> 18:58.625
[SPEAKER_08]: And unless it hurts...

18:59.741 --> 19:00.862
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, it's not a workout.

19:02.183 --> 19:06.327
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, today I played like three hours of Silent Hill 3.

19:08.108 --> 19:09.649
[SPEAKER_08]: And sat around on my ass.

19:09.669 --> 19:11.011
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was about it.

19:13.092 --> 19:13.793
[SPEAKER_08]: It rained.

19:14.212 --> 19:14.912
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19:41.570 --> 19:43.131
[SPEAKER_08]: Four modems, personally.

19:43.471 --> 19:44.772
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sit back and laugh.

20:06.317 --> 20:09.258
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our first tornado, like, in ten years.

20:09.338 --> 20:11.558
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a tornado, like, two weeks ago.

20:11.858 --> 20:14.479
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were freaking out, because it actually touched down.

20:14.919 --> 20:20.321
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, I think it maybe, like, picked up a cow and moved it six feet, and that was, like, the extent of the damage.

20:20.861 --> 20:23.281
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I mean, people were freaking out.

20:23.301 --> 20:25.042
[SPEAKER_25]: They're like, oh my god, a tornado!

20:25.062 --> 20:30.783
[SPEAKER_25]: Just bear in mind, if we suddenly drop, just keep this mental image in mind.

20:30.803 --> 20:34.084
[SPEAKER_25]: We're all piled up in the bathtub, and Rob is on top.

20:35.342 --> 20:36.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you know it, I will be on top.

20:36.664 --> 20:38.626
[SPEAKER_08]: If we drop it means the tornado dropped a cow on us.

20:40.769 --> 20:42.531
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no place like Orange Lounge.

20:42.571 --> 20:43.953
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no place like Orange Lounge.

20:44.273 --> 20:45.355
[SPEAKER_20]: Auntie Em, Auntie Em.

20:47.136 --> 20:56.361
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wanted to say, I'm surprised by the news about Curves, because my mom stopped going there, because they were playing a lot of, like, Praise Jesus music.

20:56.901 --> 20:59.043
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, well, she's too afraid to drive downtown.

20:59.083 --> 20:59.863
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other story.

21:00.363 --> 21:03.265
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really easy to get to, this particular one.

21:03.365 --> 21:10.009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you would call this, but my mom has a lot of Jewish friends, but she's not Jewish herself.

21:10.509 --> 21:11.890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a fag-hag.

21:12.270 --> 21:13.050
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

21:34.754 --> 21:39.998
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Roseville, which I realize means nothing to you guys that are out there listening internationally.

21:40.458 --> 21:45.982
[SPEAKER_02]: But imagine a town that is really white and has no culture whatsoever.

21:46.002 --> 21:46.562
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Roseville.

21:47.143 --> 21:49.605
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to pay long distance to call into Sacramento.

21:50.045 --> 21:50.745
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, seriously.

21:50.825 --> 21:54.288
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they're so far removed from reality.

21:54.488 --> 21:57.370
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Starbucks on every corner.

21:57.570 --> 21:59.091
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how else to put it.

22:00.432 --> 22:00.832
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

22:01.213 --> 22:01.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

22:02.866 --> 22:06.387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to keep going for the rest of the week just because I have a free week.

22:07.328 --> 22:14.189
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask her though if she'll let me do a write-up on it because I'm wanting to promote more fitness for everybody.

22:14.970 --> 22:18.391
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to get off their asses and actually do something for their health.

22:18.511 --> 22:30.414
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping that I can do a nice write-up on it and encourage people that if... The good thing about this is that it's an all-women gym, so if you're feeling self-conscious...

22:31.997 --> 22:33.018
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

22:50.672 --> 22:56.834
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to worry about a big gym full of people at different, because everybody is going to be at their own fitness level, but everybody is really supportive.

22:57.414 --> 23:05.917
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a really good place for someone who may be new to exercise, or looking just to lean up a bit, not necessarily bulk up, or is self-conscious.

23:07.078 --> 23:12.619
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I was giggling is because they have a guys, they have an all-guy gymnasium called Cuts.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the same thing, I think.

23:14.694 --> 23:15.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

23:37.298 --> 23:39.839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just start with my week and my day since this kind of leads into it.

23:39.959 --> 23:45.503
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually apartment hunting today, scouting out where the new home of Orange Lawn Studios will be for a little while.

23:47.404 --> 23:48.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said you were done.

23:48.946 --> 23:50.367
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I went to go blow my nose.

23:50.487 --> 23:50.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

23:50.967 --> 23:52.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then go ahead and finish and I'll tell my piece.

23:53.523 --> 23:57.704
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of it was spent working on my wedding, which I sent up for this online wedding thing.

23:58.284 --> 24:01.564
[SPEAKER_08]: They had me budgeted at $15,000, which I find incredibly retarded.

24:02.685 --> 24:03.645
[SPEAKER_08]: I chopped it down to $5,000.

24:04.205 --> 24:08.866
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just for the essentials of having a very basic ceremony and paying for food.

24:10.766 --> 24:18.107
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I did some house hunting and found out that those online foreclosure sites suck.

24:18.827 --> 24:20.808
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to have to see about getting a bank list somewhere.

24:21.968 --> 24:22.508
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm done.

24:26.147 --> 24:29.428
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, oh yeah, apartment hunting.

24:29.708 --> 24:38.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I was apartment hunting today, and me and my buddy Christopher, you know, we're both, you know, if you haven't heard, I happen to be a gay male, and my buddy Christopher is also a gay male.

24:38.372 --> 24:43.894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we exactly exude gay when we go out in public.

24:44.234 --> 24:52.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize people figure me out after spending quality time with me, but I think when I go in in a professional setting, I don't think I'm like, you know...

24:53.118 --> 24:54.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody!

24:54.199 --> 24:56.302
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think I'm like Richard Simmons gay, okay?

24:57.423 --> 25:01.187
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think I'm pretty, you know, quote-unquote, just like everybody else.

25:01.227 --> 25:01.867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say it.

25:02.989 --> 25:04.030
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on low heat, yes.

25:04.911 --> 25:08.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if gayness was an oven setting, I'm like hold warm.

25:08.594 --> 25:08.915
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.

25:08.955 --> 25:09.716
[SPEAKER_02]: My flames are hold warm.

25:09.736 --> 25:10.697
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not like Lagerfeld.

25:11.297 --> 25:12.459
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not like Karl Lagerfeld.

25:12.479 --> 25:13.560
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a fan.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.702
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't carry a fucking fan or any of that stuff.

25:16.147 --> 25:20.652
[SPEAKER_25]: So... Well, we went to an apartment complex today.

25:21.773 --> 25:25.717
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we walked in, the guy was like, okay, what kind of size apartment are you interested in getting?

25:25.757 --> 25:27.820
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, well, maybe like a two or three bedroom.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.381
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, you guys don't want a one bedroom?

25:29.942 --> 25:32.505
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like, uh, it's not like that.

25:33.526 --> 25:34.367
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, okay.

25:35.439 --> 25:39.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he just assumed that we were together and we wanted a one-bedroom.

25:39.082 --> 25:45.306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that it's possible for heterosexual males to share a one-bedroom, like college, you know, things like that.

25:45.326 --> 25:46.206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly normal.

25:46.547 --> 25:51.950
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like once you get to be 26, you know, unless you're poor.

25:51.970 --> 25:52.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to have your own bedroom.

25:52.871 --> 25:55.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's about time to get your own bedroom unless, you know, you're poor.

25:55.473 --> 25:58.915
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to think I make reasonably good money where I can afford my own bedroom, and so does Christopher.

25:59.596 --> 26:00.076
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

26:00.695 --> 26:01.095
[SPEAKER_02]: My point.

26:02.116 --> 26:03.217
[SPEAKER_02]: He was giving us the tour.

26:03.277 --> 26:06.639
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're straight in his minds because he offended us with the gay comment.

26:06.959 --> 26:09.941
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were walking around and he showed us the gymnasium.

26:10.342 --> 26:12.423
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were these two girls and they were pretty attractive.

26:12.443 --> 26:14.925
[SPEAKER_02]: These two girls that were in the gymnasium work it out.

26:14.945 --> 26:17.607
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, we got girls that work out in this gym.

26:17.627 --> 26:19.428
[SPEAKER_02]: And the girls, like you could tell, were embarrassed.

26:20.248 --> 26:21.429
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh, those poor girls.

26:22.270 --> 26:25.172
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to tell them, you have nothing to worry about.

26:25.332 --> 26:27.353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not checking you out in that kind of way.

26:27.493 --> 26:29.595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm strictly looking at the equipment you're using.

26:30.526 --> 26:31.226
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

26:53.568 --> 26:58.452
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got to play a little bit of In The Groove, which I've been playing a little more and more of.

26:58.492 --> 27:00.494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really trying to warm up to In The Groove.

27:01.455 --> 27:03.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's really changed on my opinion on it.

27:03.697 --> 27:11.363
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also played Beatmania 3, 6-mix, and I got to watch Andrew play Instant Love, which was the shit, because I love that song.

27:13.545 --> 27:17.288
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was pissed off because the two-player side, all the keys were broken, so I cannot play center mode.

27:17.688 --> 27:20.471
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a turntable left kind of guy.

27:20.951 --> 27:25.754
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why Beatmania 5 Key Machines pissed me off because I have to play center and it's all weird.

27:26.195 --> 27:27.436
[SPEAKER_02]: But Left Pride, yo!

27:30.017 --> 27:30.778
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's my week.

27:30.798 --> 27:32.219
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything else interesting to share.

27:33.420 --> 27:34.460
[SPEAKER_27]: Left Pride my ass.

27:34.801 --> 27:35.381
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

27:36.282 --> 27:38.003
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to settle this with a cream corn match?

27:39.218 --> 27:39.378
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

27:39.558 --> 27:41.039
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this could be our first dispute.

27:41.240 --> 27:42.901
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be our first official dispute.

27:44.962 --> 27:45.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

27:45.543 --> 27:47.704
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, I feel all official and shit.

27:47.964 --> 27:49.586
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, let me go to the pantry and get some corn.

27:49.686 --> 27:50.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, you have a mic.

27:50.466 --> 27:51.347
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your week and your day.

27:52.368 --> 27:52.768
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

27:53.669 --> 27:56.391
[SPEAKER_25]: Just, well, mostly all the same.

27:56.471 --> 27:58.452
[SPEAKER_25]: Work, school, work, school, work, school.

27:59.733 --> 28:00.814
[SPEAKER_25]: Finally got sick of it.

28:00.934 --> 28:01.995
[SPEAKER_25]: Took a weekend off.

28:02.095 --> 28:05.477
[SPEAKER_25]: Went to Rekakon yesterday.

28:05.557 --> 28:06.458
[SPEAKER_25]: Shoutouts to everyone there.

28:07.442 --> 28:16.968
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, came in day after just completely blowing my legs out on DDR, and the rest is going on right now.

28:18.489 --> 28:19.750
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing much to talk about, though.

28:23.332 --> 28:24.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how boring you are.

28:25.013 --> 28:25.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

28:26.354 --> 28:27.415
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a working boy now.

28:27.975 --> 28:31.137
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, this boy has grown up so fast, right before our eyes.

28:33.479 --> 28:33.799
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

28:35.731 --> 28:37.853
[SPEAKER_25]: I smell a repressed dot dot frickin dot.

28:37.913 --> 28:40.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when he was an angsty little Republican asshole?

28:41.476 --> 28:44.518
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's only a semi-angsty Republican asshole.

28:44.678 --> 28:46.219
[SPEAKER_08]: With a sense of responsibility.

28:47.881 --> 28:49.682
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay, we'll beat the partisanship out of you.

28:49.702 --> 28:50.303
[SPEAKER_26]: Andrew, you know I love you.

28:50.323 --> 28:52.445
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not like I'm crawling in my skin or anything.

28:52.525 --> 28:53.305
[SPEAKER_26]: You know I love you.

28:54.386 --> 28:55.407
[SPEAKER_26]: In a heterosexual way.

28:55.947 --> 28:57.249
[SPEAKER_26]: In a heterosexual top-heavy way.

28:58.269 --> 28:58.530
[SPEAKER_26]: Angel!

28:59.330 --> 29:00.331
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, as long as it's top-heavy.

29:01.032 --> 29:01.332
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

29:03.113 --> 29:03.774
[SPEAKER_02]: You're weak in your day.

29:04.201 --> 29:04.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop laughing!

29:05.762 --> 29:06.262
[SPEAKER_25]: Can't help it.

29:08.063 --> 29:09.504
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop laughing, this is a serious discussion.

29:10.764 --> 29:11.245
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

29:11.845 --> 29:13.546
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the one holding nachos in your lap.

29:14.566 --> 29:15.067
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

29:15.607 --> 29:16.888
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they needed to know that.

29:17.208 --> 29:19.229
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but, yeah, they were just there.

29:19.309 --> 29:19.609
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

29:21.490 --> 29:26.292
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just work and school, and I had finals this week, so, yay.

29:26.833 --> 29:29.354
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of my school days are...

29:30.134 --> 29:31.094
[SPEAKER_10]: What does RECA stand for?

29:31.114 --> 29:33.795
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents of East Contra Costa County Anime

29:56.520 --> 29:59.882
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to go!

30:00.322 --> 30:01.743
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw we.

30:01.943 --> 30:07.085
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody that went to RekkaCon is listening, please don't tell me how fabulous the convention was because I'm quite bitter.

30:08.346 --> 30:08.786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

30:08.806 --> 30:09.266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get over it.

30:09.286 --> 30:10.287
[SPEAKER_25]: Wendell sends his love.

30:11.227 --> 30:12.708
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jahi and everyone else.

30:12.908 --> 30:17.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play the Step Squad promo after the next break so I can hear them.

30:18.811 --> 30:19.531
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone was there.

30:19.551 --> 30:20.051
[SPEAKER_10]: It was cool.

30:21.952 --> 30:23.193
[SPEAKER_10]: I got chased by an agent.

30:23.333 --> 30:23.933
[SPEAKER_10]: That was weird.

30:25.979 --> 30:28.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said I got chased by an Asian.

30:28.462 --> 30:28.662
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

30:28.762 --> 30:30.164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what?

30:30.404 --> 30:32.066
[SPEAKER_25]: We had an Agent Smith cosplayer.

30:32.586 --> 30:32.706
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh.

30:33.527 --> 30:37.431
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's just say he's been discouraging me from playing MXO lately.

30:38.593 --> 30:41.095
[SPEAKER_10]: My... You were playing Nestor.

30:43.137 --> 30:43.958
[SPEAKER_26]: I sense a dispute.

30:44.819 --> 30:45.059
[SPEAKER_25]: Cream corn.

30:45.099 --> 30:47.101
[SPEAKER_25]: And every time I see a pedestrian, I'm...

30:47.961 --> 30:49.302
[SPEAKER_25]: Out of curiosity, how is MXO?

30:49.322 --> 30:51.564
[SPEAKER_25]: I saw Loki play it for like 15 minutes, but that was about it.

30:51.584 --> 30:52.985
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was your MMO update.

30:53.025 --> 30:53.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Angel.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.075
[SPEAKER_10]: As I just taunted in front of the mic, that was funny.

31:21.315 --> 31:23.097
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

31:23.297 --> 31:25.959
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Rekkon yesterday, CCL last night.

31:26.079 --> 31:27.880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay for CCL or something.

31:28.420 --> 31:29.561
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn those card systems.

31:29.641 --> 31:30.142
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn them.

31:30.922 --> 31:32.243
[SPEAKER_10]: Those stupid cards wouldn't rate.

31:32.263 --> 31:33.304
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going, what the hell?

31:34.365 --> 31:34.885
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

31:34.945 --> 31:36.967
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with arcades that use cards?

31:37.438 --> 31:41.500
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, cards with a little magnetic strip on the back so it makes it look like, you know, it's all important or something.

31:41.540 --> 31:44.121
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the card for CCL is ugly, too.

31:44.641 --> 31:49.143
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go put the card up on the webcam, www.orangelonsradio.com.

31:49.203 --> 31:50.744
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fugly, it's more fugly.

31:52.185 --> 31:53.645
[SPEAKER_25]: People are wondering what MXO is.

31:53.745 --> 31:54.946
[SPEAKER_25]: The Matrix Online.

31:55.826 --> 31:56.086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

31:57.927 --> 31:58.788
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the card on the cam.

32:00.510 --> 32:04.612
[SPEAKER_10]: And other than that, not much except for coming to the show today.

32:04.752 --> 32:07.573
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there's not that much in my life going on.

32:08.574 --> 32:08.854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet.

32:09.734 --> 32:10.174
[SPEAKER_10]: Or something.

32:10.234 --> 32:11.775
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Spring Break starting tomorrow.

32:13.336 --> 32:14.436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, Spring Break!

32:14.516 --> 32:14.977
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

32:16.637 --> 32:19.739
[SPEAKER_10]: Where I'm going to do nothing but play MMOs all week or something.

32:21.540 --> 32:21.800
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

32:22.560 --> 32:24.701
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to Nude Beach, you dumbass.

32:28.692 --> 32:29.052
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

32:29.112 --> 32:29.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw the nude beach.

32:29.872 --> 32:32.293
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Curves because they all exercise topless there.

32:36.154 --> 32:36.894
[SPEAKER_02]: At the nude beach?

32:36.974 --> 32:37.574
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

32:41.716 --> 32:42.256
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

32:44.936 --> 32:45.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it, Angel?

32:45.617 --> 32:45.817
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

32:46.197 --> 32:46.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

32:46.457 --> 32:46.717
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

32:46.937 --> 32:47.297
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

32:47.417 --> 32:48.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand the mic off to Loki.

32:49.358 --> 32:52.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, Loki, why do you have gummy bears stuck to your forehead?

32:52.298 --> 32:54.119
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... What the hell?

32:54.459 --> 32:55.099
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bored.

32:55.119 --> 32:55.659
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

32:56.900 --> 32:58.080
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they stick.

32:59.980 --> 33:00.420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why.

33:00.440 --> 33:04.663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's because I touch myself at night.

33:06.745 --> 33:07.125
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

33:07.145 --> 33:09.707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty stuck.

33:10.047 --> 33:11.868
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to eat it off?

33:12.489 --> 33:13.349
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is gross!

33:13.589 --> 33:14.350
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

33:14.830 --> 33:17.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Such blatant heterosexuality in my home.

33:17.672 --> 33:27.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, just so you guys know, because this isn't TV, Loki's fiance just ate the gummy bear off of his forehead and totally licked his forehead in the process.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.620
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know where that's been.

33:29.748 --> 33:31.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, breeders.

33:32.170 --> 33:35.333
[SPEAKER_06]: I put worse things in my mouth off his body.

33:36.494 --> 33:38.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we... Do we have a bleeper?

33:38.536 --> 33:40.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a dump button or a bleeper?

33:41.218 --> 33:42.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways... Oh wait, I forgot we're internet.

33:43.280 --> 33:45.803
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so... What did I do this week?

33:46.604 --> 33:46.944
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

33:47.004 --> 33:49.026
[SPEAKER_03]: I interviewed for my games position.

33:49.086 --> 33:50.027
[SPEAKER_03]: I did really well.

33:50.387 --> 33:50.928
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?

33:52.349 --> 33:53.310
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so...

33:55.015 --> 33:55.655
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not break it.

33:55.695 --> 33:57.476
[SPEAKER_03]: It was faulty craftsmanship.

33:57.496 --> 33:58.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not shop at Zale's.

34:24.420 --> 34:25.121
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

34:36.175 --> 34:38.857
[SPEAKER_03]: You just eat them and you want more and more and more.

34:39.117 --> 34:41.759
[SPEAKER_02]: Mall pretzels are the shit with like the mustard.

34:42.419 --> 34:45.902
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Fields, pretzel time pretzels are the fucking bomb.

34:46.182 --> 34:49.785
[SPEAKER_03]: You eat them and you're just like, need more, more, crack, more.

34:50.005 --> 34:52.827
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get those huge soft like pretzels at Costco.

34:53.327 --> 34:54.348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're not the same.

34:54.648 --> 34:55.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the same at all.

34:55.589 --> 34:56.630
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but they're close.

34:56.650 --> 34:57.190
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.

34:57.490 --> 35:00.933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I bought four one time and I ate them all.

35:01.393 --> 35:05.276
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got full, I waited until I became unful and I ate them at rest.

35:05.416 --> 35:05.696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just,

35:06.218 --> 35:08.259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like me and drumsticks.

35:08.499 --> 35:10.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the ice cream cones.

35:10.220 --> 35:10.520
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

35:10.540 --> 35:11.841
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.

35:12.261 --> 35:13.602
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what else did we do this week?

35:14.603 --> 35:27.730
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the apartment stuff finalized so we're going to be moving into our place on the 16th of next month and then I know there's some other stuff I did.

35:28.130 --> 35:30.672
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I will no longer be living together as of next month.

35:30.712 --> 35:31.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Freedom!

35:31.692 --> 35:34.994
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be living with Nellie.

35:36.316 --> 35:39.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, wait a minute, you're moving in together before you're married?

35:41.078 --> 35:43.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sinners living in sin!

35:44.580 --> 35:44.940
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

35:45.160 --> 35:49.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyways, so, um... How did you know the name of our apartment complex?

35:50.943 --> 35:54.405
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're at... My household will be all gay.

35:54.425 --> 35:56.386
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew!

35:56.446 --> 35:58.287
We should move into, like, the same thing.

35:58.647 --> 36:00.408
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, we keep cutting Loki off.

36:01.948 --> 36:02.929
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

36:03.880 --> 36:09.044
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week, as usual, just because I can't.

36:09.424 --> 36:16.570
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be playing other games, but some person hasn't returned my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so I haven't been able to play that.

36:16.930 --> 36:18.631
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got bored and I bought more games.

36:18.972 --> 36:26.417
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought Dog's Life and Gran Turismo 4, and I must say I can't drive for shit in Gran Turismo 4.

36:27.218 --> 36:31.842
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing you do, and I don't know why people do this, at least I did, is you drive your car.

36:32.282 --> 36:33.623
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick your car in the game.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.732
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I picked my Ford Focus, and guess what?

36:37.153 --> 36:37.973
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks!

36:38.653 --> 36:39.753
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a race car!

36:40.473 --> 36:45.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I was playing the rally mode, where you basically... Well, as a reminder, you own a Ford.

36:46.514 --> 36:46.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

36:47.115 --> 37:00.617
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I was playing the rally mode, whatever, versus, like, they had some, like, really nice Subaru rally car, you know, versus the boat that I picked, and obviously the rally car beat my boat, and that pissed me off.

37:01.597 --> 37:04.058
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so, anyways...

37:04.542 --> 37:08.083
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk more about those games on the podcast, which you can download every week.

37:08.924 --> 37:18.907
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I did that, and all I must say, a little teaser for the podcast, I've been throwing poop on cars.

37:21.368 --> 37:22.048
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop on cars.

37:22.088 --> 37:22.909
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not kidding.

37:23.469 --> 37:23.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Not kidding.

37:25.650 --> 37:29.611
[SPEAKER_03]: As a dog, I've taken shits in places I've never known that I could take shits in.

37:31.092 --> 37:31.592
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

37:32.492 --> 37:33.293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very fun game.

37:33.414 --> 37:34.495
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, seriously try it.

37:34.616 --> 37:35.918
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gran Turismo 4, beautiful.

37:37.681 --> 37:39.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo 4 is a sexy game.

37:39.904 --> 37:40.846
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very sexy.

37:41.066 --> 37:43.911
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like this like, really like, operatic, you know, like,

37:44.770 --> 37:47.011
[SPEAKER_03]: Music in the beginning, and I'm like, what the hell?

37:47.952 --> 37:50.893
[SPEAKER_03]: But I missed the Cardigan song that was in Gran Turismo 2.

37:51.113 --> 37:54.334
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Crystal Method in this game, which is pretty cool.

37:54.735 --> 38:00.557
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen the soundtrack list yet, but they had some Crystal Method in there, and that was kind of neat.

38:01.398 --> 38:05.820
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know, it's just fun stuff, playing a few sim files.

38:07.540 --> 38:11.162
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, my wrist was sore from playing Step Mania.

38:11.182 --> 38:11.462
[SPEAKER_18]: Meh.

38:11.922 --> 38:12.303
[SPEAKER_03]: Meh.

38:12.863 --> 38:13.023
[SPEAKER_03]: Meh.

38:13.666 --> 38:15.246
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm getting better, okay?

38:16.387 --> 38:20.327
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, pretty soon... No, I've got masturbation down.

38:20.367 --> 38:21.828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about step mania.

38:22.808 --> 38:23.708
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not worried about that.

38:24.768 --> 38:26.829
[SPEAKER_03]: You already AAA'd masturbation, sorry.

38:26.909 --> 38:27.489
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.330
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, I should mention this because it was quite funny.

38:31.670 --> 38:33.510
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out... No, not masturbation.

38:33.910 --> 38:37.071
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out last week my mom was listening to our show.

38:38.711 --> 38:41.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, maybe I should stop saying... And masturbating?

38:41.812 --> 38:43.312
[SPEAKER_02]: I should stop saying things like that.

38:46.581 --> 38:57.751
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if Matthew's mom is listening, Matthew has never masturbated in his life, and he's never looked at a girl with impure thoughts, and he gets straight A's in school.

38:58.792 --> 38:59.452
[SPEAKER_02]: How good is school?

39:00.994 --> 39:03.776
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember that one time she walked in on you?

39:03.876 --> 39:04.937
[SPEAKER_17]: She's gonna... Oh my god!

39:06.218 --> 39:09.161
[SPEAKER_18]: You're gonna have to fight

39:10.723 --> 39:13.544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why Nelly doesn't get a microphone on this show.

39:15.204 --> 39:18.665
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think the mic picked that up, but... I think it did.

39:20.305 --> 39:21.665
[SPEAKER_03]: Judging by the reaction.

39:21.685 --> 39:32.528
[SPEAKER_02]: I am at a loss for words.

39:32.828 --> 39:35.388
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... I don't know what to say.

39:35.408 --> 39:35.888
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

39:36.188 --> 39:39.049
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs my sister to help her, you know, with finding stuff.

39:42.861 --> 39:43.882
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not in the chat room.

39:43.982 --> 39:45.483
[SPEAKER_02]: She wouldn't even know how to get in the chat room.

39:45.663 --> 39:47.004
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, MPQ's got a point.

39:47.044 --> 39:49.105
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you don't tell your parents what you do on the internet.

39:49.165 --> 39:50.246
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what?

39:50.526 --> 39:51.467
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents find out.

39:52.107 --> 39:55.870
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like they find out about masturbation, they find out about your radio show on the internet.

39:55.890 --> 39:57.411
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a freaking adult, okay?

39:57.471 --> 39:58.131
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

39:58.812 --> 39:59.272
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

40:00.113 --> 40:00.433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

40:03.195 --> 40:04.035
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'm done.

40:04.135 --> 40:04.676
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I did.

40:05.136 --> 40:05.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

40:06.417 --> 40:08.078
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie, you want to share anything about your week and your day?

40:09.219 --> 40:09.319
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

40:09.339 --> 40:09.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

40:11.000 --> 40:11.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

40:12.170 --> 40:16.012
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get a break, we are going to go to a break pretty soon here, but I want to bring up some news.

40:16.872 --> 40:18.113
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to talk about Bomani news.

40:18.133 --> 40:19.073
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that after the break.

40:19.453 --> 40:38.781
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about this, because I know a lot of Bomani nerds are into this series as well, and this is definitely worth mentioning, but it's been a little mentioned in Nintendo Power, a little tiny, little slip in Namco's upcoming calendar says that Katamari Damacy DS is on the way.

40:40.122 --> 40:40.442
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

40:40.982 --> 40:42.623
[SPEAKER_02]: Something for you guys to think about there.

40:42.643 --> 40:45.426
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question is, how in the hell are you going to control that?

40:45.546 --> 40:46.466
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be weird.

40:46.586 --> 40:47.667
[SPEAKER_02]: Stylus, hello.

40:47.707 --> 40:51.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be that faux analog thing like Mario 64 has?

40:51.570 --> 40:52.991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's how it's going to work.

40:53.452 --> 40:54.172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite simple.

40:54.593 --> 41:01.358
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have, you know, not faux analog, but you're going to have the directional button and you have your four buttons.

41:01.398 --> 41:03.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your two sticks right there.

41:04.600 --> 41:07.242
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or you can use the stylus to roll it.

41:07.303 --> 41:09.064
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of move the stylus.

41:11.087 --> 41:14.748
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just keep rolling it forward to the side using the stylus.

41:14.788 --> 41:15.508
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would work.

41:16.969 --> 41:20.029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that the DS is going to get a game.

41:21.010 --> 41:24.130
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep hearing about all this cool stuff that's going to come out on the DS.

41:25.231 --> 41:37.334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday when I was at GameStop looking at games, I looked at the wall of all the stuff that's supposed to be launching with the PSP, and then I walked over to the DS section, and it was literally half a shelf.

41:37.964 --> 41:38.765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even a shelf.

41:38.845 --> 41:40.046
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a small shelf.

41:40.426 --> 41:42.488
[SPEAKER_03]: They had maybe ten games.

41:42.948 --> 41:43.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

41:43.468 --> 41:44.729
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was everything that's out right now.

41:44.749 --> 41:46.851
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, God, the DS sucks.

41:47.732 --> 41:51.315
[SPEAKER_27]: But the thing is, is that the DS as a system, it doesn't suck.

41:51.535 --> 41:53.636
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Well, they released some games then.

41:53.656 --> 41:55.898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, because they're bastard people.

41:55.998 --> 41:57.560
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no other explanation for that.

41:57.760 --> 41:58.140
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

41:58.180 --> 42:01.323
[SPEAKER_03]: Other systems did the exact same thing, and it failed horribly.

42:01.463 --> 42:03.284
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't say Engage, or I'll hate you forever.

42:05.911 --> 42:07.992
[SPEAKER_03]: No, those both sucked from launch.

42:08.072 --> 42:11.453
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking about Nintendo 64.

42:11.673 --> 42:13.014
[SPEAKER_03]: That failed as a system.

42:13.634 --> 42:15.815
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because there wasn't that many games out for it.

42:16.015 --> 42:18.696
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Atari Lynx.

42:18.756 --> 42:21.858
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have Pokemon Snap.

42:22.598 --> 42:24.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Pokemon Dash out right now.

42:26.280 --> 42:29.601
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the DS is that it does have a lot of good games coming soon.

42:30.442 --> 42:31.763
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing DS, coming soon.

42:31.783 --> 42:32.744
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, September.

42:32.904 --> 42:33.784
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, fun.

42:34.244 --> 42:35.966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's assuming they don't push it back.

42:36.246 --> 42:36.986
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

42:38.787 --> 42:41.169
[SPEAKER_25]: See, the problem with DS, though, is it's a new technology.

42:41.329 --> 42:44.711
[SPEAKER_25]: Not everyone knows how to market for dual screens.

42:45.632 --> 42:47.353
[SPEAKER_25]: Not everyone is willing to take the plunge.

42:48.213 --> 42:50.915
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, PSP, everyone knows how to do one screen.

42:51.715 --> 42:52.096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

42:52.656 --> 42:54.257
[SPEAKER_02]: Castlevania DS will make it all better.

42:54.277 --> 42:57.199
[SPEAKER_25]: Castlevania DS will be my god when it's out.

42:57.359 --> 42:57.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

42:58.570 --> 43:00.611
[SPEAKER_27]: Speaking of PSP, is anybody planning on picking one up?

43:01.511 --> 43:02.612
[SPEAKER_09]: I already have ours reserved.

43:03.452 --> 43:06.193
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you guys have a demo in the house because of what your man does?

43:06.373 --> 43:07.974
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's got one at the store.

43:08.234 --> 43:08.654
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, right on.

43:09.015 --> 43:10.075
[SPEAKER_27]: Has he given you any feedback on it?

43:10.615 --> 43:11.376
[SPEAKER_08]: He said it was fun.

43:11.976 --> 43:12.896
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you gotten to play it at all yet?

43:12.916 --> 43:16.118
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really been all that excited about playing it.

43:16.798 --> 43:24.762
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a PSP, but I don't want it right now because I just have too much other shit going on, which sucks because I wish somebody would just send me a free one.

43:24.782 --> 43:25.642
[SPEAKER_08]: I need Wipeout Pure.

43:26.874 --> 43:28.455
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of... Oh, see, I want Lumines.

43:30.456 --> 43:31.997
[SPEAKER_25]: I would buy it for Metal Gear Acid.

43:32.937 --> 43:35.499
[SPEAKER_02]: See, all these cool games coming out, like, right around launch period.

43:35.699 --> 43:39.301
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the DS, like... What did we get at launch?

43:39.341 --> 43:41.742
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Mario, which was cool, but it was a rehashed game.

43:42.482 --> 43:43.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man 2.

43:44.303 --> 43:45.084
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-de-doo!

43:45.224 --> 43:46.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel the magic.

43:46.665 --> 43:47.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun for about five minutes.

43:47.505 --> 43:48.185
[SPEAKER_25]: Fun, fun, fun, fun.

43:48.306 --> 43:48.866
[SPEAKER_02]: For about five minutes.

43:48.886 --> 43:49.546
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Driller DS.

43:51.067 --> 43:52.408
[SPEAKER_25]: And eventually we're getting some fun stuff.

43:52.428 --> 43:53.168
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mr. Driller's been done.

43:53.188 --> 43:54.249
[SPEAKER_25]: WarioWare Twisted.

43:54.909 --> 43:55.569
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, Touched.

43:55.770 --> 43:56.510
[SPEAKER_02]: Touched is already out.

43:57.268 --> 43:58.611
[SPEAKER_25]: We've finally gotten to that.

44:01.055 --> 44:03.819
[SPEAKER_25]: Castlevania DS will be out soon, supposedly.

44:03.839 --> 44:04.080
[SPEAKER_25]: Mario Kart

44:09.275 --> 44:11.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a long-term gamer and the battery life thing is still kind of... No.

44:34.881 --> 44:36.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

44:36.902 --> 44:39.944
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, I promised DarkSakura we'd do some forest style music.

44:39.964 --> 44:41.805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what we're going to do.

44:41.945 --> 44:43.246
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start off with Empathy.

44:44.307 --> 44:45.167
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that song is rad.

44:46.508 --> 44:50.330
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and some news on night style.

44:50.490 --> 44:53.192
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that kind of involves indirectly some news from forest style.

44:53.212 --> 44:55.694
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio.

46:02.026 --> 46:02.836
Thanks for watching!

49:01.463 --> 49:01.957
Thank you.

52:23.317 --> 52:26.578
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

52:26.638 --> 52:26.858
[SPEAKER_15]: Wee!

52:44.704 --> 52:46.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Taku, Empathy, LED, Infinite Prayer, The Floating Flocks

52:57.383 --> 53:02.666
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Taka featuring Jasmine, Final Countdown, and Ryu with StarMine.

53:02.706 --> 53:15.073
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ryu, one of those interesting guys because he had that song in 4th style and then disappeared for a long ass time and then came back and I don't remember if it was 9th or 10th, but he disappeared for a while and then just recently came back to the series.

53:15.173 --> 53:17.314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hope you enjoyed that stuff from 4th style.

53:17.754 --> 53:22.977
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, 2DX 9th style is on people's minds right now because...

53:23.891 --> 53:25.031
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:46.815 --> 53:49.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some of you guys out there may already have been seeing it.

53:50.196 --> 53:51.797
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't, though, you're going to be getting that very soon.

53:51.977 --> 53:56.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I need to get my copy still, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm poor.

53:57.079 --> 53:58.519
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't be getting it for a little while.

53:58.840 --> 53:59.960
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully soon.

54:01.161 --> 54:05.322
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I know you usually pick up a lot of the new 2DX styles as they come out.

54:05.342 --> 54:06.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting this one?

54:06.963 --> 54:08.223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just didn't pre-order it.

54:08.823 --> 54:12.885
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not huge on 9th style, so I don't know if you maybe passed on it or what.

54:13.105 --> 54:15.506
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly didn't care about 9th style, but I'm going to get it.

54:17.776 --> 54:19.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be a perfectionist, right?

54:19.137 --> 54:20.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a completionist, I should say.

54:20.318 --> 54:21.618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm still missing Forthstyle.

54:22.439 --> 54:23.139
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess that's true.

54:23.159 --> 54:24.520
[SPEAKER_02]: But Forthstyle's a little harder to find.

54:25.821 --> 54:26.181
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

54:26.281 --> 54:26.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

54:26.521 --> 54:27.002
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was.

54:27.562 --> 54:28.082
[SPEAKER_08]: I can find it.

54:28.283 --> 54:28.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, rad.

54:28.623 --> 54:29.843
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't spent the money on it.

54:30.304 --> 54:34.987
[SPEAKER_08]: But Forthstyle's going to be on the back burner because I have to get Vibriple.

54:36.087 --> 54:36.187
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

54:37.188 --> 54:37.488
[SPEAKER_27]: Cool.

54:37.728 --> 54:40.230
[SPEAKER_08]: And I still need to find Mojibribbon, but that one's been kind of out.

54:43.482 --> 54:46.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, four style songs that are coming back into Night Style.

54:46.805 --> 54:48.367
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of repeats.

54:48.407 --> 54:57.715
[SPEAKER_02]: If you check out the official Night Style Consumer Version website, konamistudio.co.jp slash bm2, the number two, dx2.

54:58.835 --> 55:07.919
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has a whole big song list.

55:08.259 --> 55:09.960
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the songs coming back from 4Style.

55:09.980 --> 55:10.580
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some of them.

55:10.620 --> 55:11.320
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I recognize.

55:11.421 --> 55:12.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Empathy, of course.

55:12.521 --> 55:14.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Kamikaze is coming back.

55:15.782 --> 55:17.763
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is interesting, I think, from 3Style.

55:17.863 --> 55:19.204
[SPEAKER_02]: Dong Teppo, number one.

55:19.364 --> 55:19.964
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that one?

55:20.704 --> 55:21.305
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that song.

55:21.325 --> 55:22.385
[SPEAKER_02]: That song was hilarious.

55:23.105 --> 55:27.167
[SPEAKER_02]: And Macho Gang by Anal Spider is coming back.

55:27.765 --> 55:28.726
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

55:29.546 --> 55:30.526
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

55:31.067 --> 55:32.948
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Hamburger Helper video that goes along with that.

55:33.768 --> 55:37.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Some very interesting consumer tracks making their way into the Night Style Home version.

55:38.010 --> 55:41.592
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple LED tracks, including Jaeger Final Attack.

55:42.421 --> 55:44.541
[SPEAKER_02]: and another song called Photoingenic.

55:45.101 --> 55:51.523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then LED usually teams up with Groovy, but actually Groovy has their own song featuring No Plus Chin.

55:52.423 --> 55:56.883
[SPEAKER_02]: 5PM Eternal is a song that they have in the Night Style.

55:56.923 --> 55:58.524
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, for the full list, you can head on over there.

55:59.004 --> 56:02.344
[SPEAKER_02]: All the brand new Night Style songs are making their way to the home version.

56:02.484 --> 56:06.305
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they stopped doing the license thing with Night Style.

56:06.325 --> 56:07.985
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I haven't noticed anything missing.

56:08.505 --> 56:10.486
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was something missing, then I just didn't notice it.

56:11.346 --> 56:11.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

56:12.206 --> 56:14.788
[SPEAKER_02]: My only concern is that Bad Boy Bass made it in.

56:17.809 --> 56:21.632
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bad Boy Bass did make it in, so that was my only concern, because it's my favorite Nightstyle song.

56:22.792 --> 56:32.358
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I'm sure Lionski, for those of you guys that are into Kiriyamaoka, and who can blame you, I'm sure that song also is making its debut, along with the video in Nightstyle.

56:32.378 --> 56:35.640
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good times there for 2DX Nightstyle.

56:36.100 --> 56:37.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, I know you're really into 2DX as well.

56:37.601 --> 56:39.342
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the Nightstyle release this week?

56:40.808 --> 56:42.429
[SPEAKER_10]: I want it, but I need to get 8th first.

56:43.770 --> 56:44.771
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm a little behind.

56:44.951 --> 56:46.932
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm a lot... Well, I'm not that behind.

56:47.433 --> 56:50.615
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need 8th and 9th now, so... You know.

56:51.956 --> 56:53.156
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus I need to practice more, too.

56:55.678 --> 56:57.119
[SPEAKER_02]: Practice makes perfect.

56:57.880 --> 57:01.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki, I know you hate 2DX, but any interest in this whatsoever?

57:03.864 --> 57:04.624
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, mic's not on, bud.

57:04.644 --> 57:07.266
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hate 2DX, but, uh...

57:11.002 --> 57:13.043
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's breaking the mic!

57:13.183 --> 57:13.684
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fine.

57:14.744 --> 57:16.906
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, but there's pieces of metal jetting out.

57:17.206 --> 57:17.566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yuck.

57:18.307 --> 57:20.108
[SPEAKER_03]: And the top part's coming off.

57:20.468 --> 57:20.748
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

57:22.129 --> 57:22.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

57:22.689 --> 57:22.949
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

57:24.891 --> 57:25.371
[SPEAKER_03]: My thoughts.

57:27.032 --> 57:27.752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another game.

57:28.032 --> 57:28.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

57:31.495 --> 57:31.755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

57:33.296 --> 57:33.696
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

57:33.876 --> 57:35.017
[SPEAKER_03]: Another 2DX game.

57:35.517 --> 57:37.438
[SPEAKER_03]: How have they made it any better?

57:38.038 --> 57:38.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, they haven't.

57:40.396 --> 57:41.857
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know about the timing.

57:41.917 --> 57:44.580
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get some feedback on how the timing is.

57:44.620 --> 57:47.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I haven't had the time today to read the message boards.

57:47.382 --> 57:53.248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that when we open up the Skype line later, maybe some folks might already know about if the timing got better from the arcade.

57:54.168 --> 58:04.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to say we did have somebody was saying, I think it was Siggy or somebody on the Skype line a couple weeks back was saying that the timing is somewhat better, which I hope is true.

58:05.959 --> 58:06.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

58:08.652 --> 58:09.873
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for Night Style.

58:09.913 --> 58:11.594
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't have a whole lot else to add to that.

58:11.995 --> 58:16.338
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anybody else have any exciting Night Style related news?

58:17.139 --> 58:19.741
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of want the Deluxe set.

58:20.301 --> 58:21.002
[SPEAKER_27]: What is coming in?

58:21.082 --> 58:22.283
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even remember what's coming in.

58:22.303 --> 58:27.547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a DVD, the VRare 10, and a sticker book.

58:28.348 --> 58:28.568
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

58:30.630 --> 58:33.092
[SPEAKER_08]: When I saw sticker book, I was like, I don't want stickers.

58:34.272 --> 58:37.315
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost bought the Papa Music 9, the Deluxe set.

58:38.405 --> 58:39.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that was pretty cool.

58:39.326 --> 58:40.487
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I wanted a teacup.

58:41.728 --> 58:44.410
[SPEAKER_08]: But I ended up buying right-hands instead.

58:44.850 --> 58:51.876
[SPEAKER_02]: You know another song that shows up in Night Style Consumer is Number 13 by Taco with Respect for JSB.

58:52.537 --> 58:56.140
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be one of them preview tracks from a future 2DX style.

58:56.680 --> 58:57.421
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

58:57.461 --> 59:00.123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of glad that that is showing up.

59:00.443 --> 59:01.344
[SPEAKER_02]: I like seeing preview songs.

59:01.364 --> 59:05.127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just glad we're getting more 2DX, but now they need to start bringing out the Guitadora.

59:05.538 --> 59:07.900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird that they've all been coming out like back to back.

59:07.960 --> 59:12.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we went years with no 2DX at home and then suddenly, bam, 7th, 8th, now 9th.

59:12.484 --> 59:13.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, we fucked up.

59:13.846 --> 59:23.394
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that if this does well, which I assume it will because it's got a pretty big following here in the States, 10th will be out probably by the end of summer, which is rock.

59:24.215 --> 59:25.496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 10th style is pretty cool too.

59:25.516 --> 59:27.198
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have my Gradius.

59:27.566 --> 59:32.709
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember back in the day when they're like, We don't make you seven style unless you vote!

59:33.149 --> 59:34.070
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you buy!

59:35.031 --> 59:36.331
[SPEAKER_17]: Or else we don't make!

59:36.612 --> 59:40.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I remember that, that they were saying, And now they're like, Oh, you like!

59:40.374 --> 59:41.354
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy the game!

59:41.374 --> 59:42.955
[SPEAKER_03]: We make more for you!

59:44.876 --> 59:46.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you for that.

59:46.197 --> 59:49.739
[SPEAKER_02]: You can address those cards and letters to matt at orangelawnsradio.com, by the way.

59:53.742 --> 59:53.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

59:55.652 --> 01:00:00.514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just, I kind of hope that they're still going to come out in the arcade as well, like 2DX Red.

01:00:00.534 --> 01:00:05.596
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't gotten a chance to play Red, but I'm kind of hoping to when I get to go down to L.A.

01:00:05.696 --> 01:00:06.296
[SPEAKER_02]: in a couple weeks.

01:00:06.636 --> 01:00:07.496
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

01:00:07.997 --> 01:00:12.958
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully that'll be out for home by early next year, so at the rate things are going, that'll be pretty cool.

01:00:14.099 --> 01:00:18.320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, do you think there's any room for 2DX to evolve in the near future?

01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:21.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Or beat, I guess I should say, maybe not necessarily 2DX, but Beatmania?

01:00:22.922 --> 01:00:24.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though Beatmania, the 5D version...

01:00:26.977 --> 01:00:27.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Been there, done that.

01:00:27.717 --> 01:00:28.658
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard Mania doubles.

01:00:28.718 --> 01:00:29.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

01:00:32.798 --> 01:00:34.399
[SPEAKER_08]: They can come with an ice cream dispenser.

01:00:34.439 --> 01:00:36.339
[SPEAKER_03]: Typing of the beat.

01:00:37.299 --> 01:00:38.080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they did that.

01:00:38.140 --> 01:00:38.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:39.740
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat Mania, da, da, da.

01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:41.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.681
[SPEAKER_02]: Da, da, da.

01:00:43.201 --> 01:00:43.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:00:43.621 --> 01:00:44.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

01:00:44.821 --> 01:00:46.481
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was total crap, too.

01:00:47.282 --> 01:00:49.522
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that Lupin typing game.

01:00:50.456 --> 01:00:50.996
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play that.

01:00:51.016 --> 01:00:52.276
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Typing of the Dead at home.

01:00:52.497 --> 01:00:57.658
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad that there was not any more keyboard manias that came out.

01:00:57.898 --> 01:00:58.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of 50-key.

01:00:59.998 --> 01:01:00.919
[SPEAKER_08]: I like keyboard manias.

01:01:00.979 --> 01:01:02.479
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the para-para?

01:01:02.619 --> 01:01:04.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Or dance maniacs, for that matter.

01:01:04.399 --> 01:01:06.620
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the pata-pata craze has died down in Japan.

01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:11.001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard rumors that Velfire just ain't what it used to be.

01:01:11.721 --> 01:01:18.383
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Velfire was a club, just a regular club anyway, that as far as I'm aware just did pata-pata on certain nights.

01:01:19.063 --> 01:01:19.283
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

01:01:22.254 --> 01:01:23.174
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything to add to that.

01:01:23.194 --> 01:01:23.875
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to go there.

01:01:24.335 --> 01:01:24.855
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that.

01:01:25.196 --> 01:01:30.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be hilarious that if, like, in San Francisco or something, there was actually a bar where they did that as well.

01:01:30.659 --> 01:01:31.540
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that would be hilarious.

01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:34.802
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if people can fucking country line dance, why can't they para para?

01:01:34.902 --> 01:01:35.342
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

01:01:36.003 --> 01:01:37.724
[SPEAKER_02]: You look just as stupid doing either one.

01:01:38.925 --> 01:01:39.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just me.

01:01:39.966 --> 01:01:41.247
[SPEAKER_08]: Para para, though, is kind of cool.

01:01:41.267 --> 01:01:42.207
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like cheerleading, though.

01:01:43.928 --> 01:01:44.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

01:01:46.510 --> 01:01:47.351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all happy.

01:01:47.371 --> 01:01:49.192
[SPEAKER_08]: And not boot scootin'.

01:01:50.177 --> 01:01:57.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I go to karaoke and some lesbian will get up there and start singing a country song like, you know, Don't Break My Heart, Mike.

01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.221
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

01:01:58.261 --> 01:01:58.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody sings that.

01:01:58.821 --> 01:02:00.102
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, they'll sing Dixie Chicks or something.

01:02:00.482 --> 01:02:03.463
[SPEAKER_02]: And people start country line dancing and I'm like, that's so weird.

01:02:05.364 --> 01:02:05.904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

01:02:05.944 --> 01:02:07.225
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't hate, but it's weird.

01:02:07.245 --> 01:02:08.145
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the straights!

01:02:08.245 --> 01:02:08.626
[SPEAKER_17]: Get them!

01:02:13.508 --> 01:02:14.608
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes perfect sense.

01:02:15.309 --> 01:02:16.709
[SPEAKER_03]: Gay people don't line dance.

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:18.310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's documented in books.

01:02:22.222 --> 01:02:28.508
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:02:46.141 --> 01:02:46.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

01:02:46.982 --> 01:02:47.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's surprising.

01:02:48.043 --> 01:02:52.146
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that square dancing would be like a whole class in Alabama that you take for units.

01:02:54.347 --> 01:02:55.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teasing.

01:02:55.728 --> 01:02:55.989
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

01:02:56.429 --> 01:02:57.510
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you can do with that finger.

01:02:59.431 --> 01:03:00.312
[SPEAKER_05]: I have plenty of ideas.

01:03:00.912 --> 01:03:01.913
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure a sheep?

01:03:05.756 --> 01:03:07.618
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit him, please.

01:03:08.438 --> 01:03:09.059
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can't.

01:03:12.381 --> 01:03:13.302
[SPEAKER_02]: That's solid metal.

01:03:16.339 --> 01:03:16.900
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's hot.

01:03:46.187 --> 01:03:47.588
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer 2005, quote-unquote.

01:03:49.228 --> 01:03:52.889
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a pre-order bonus that you can get.

01:03:55.350 --> 01:04:03.093
[SPEAKER_02]: An In The Groove soundtrack, an In The Groove t-shirt, a Red Octane temporary tattoo, so you can be cool.

01:04:03.333 --> 01:04:04.934
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, lame!

01:04:04.994 --> 01:04:09.995
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on that Red Octane tattoo and go to the Harley Davidson bar and show how cool you are.

01:04:10.676 --> 01:04:12.556
[SPEAKER_02]: A Red Octane keychain.

01:04:12.576 --> 01:04:13.937
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh!

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:22.493
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is like crap that they made that they tried to give away at conventions, and it couldn't go anywhere, and they're like, what are we going to do with all this crap?

01:04:22.733 --> 01:04:24.093
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, let's give it away!

01:04:24.173 --> 01:04:24.874
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

01:04:25.094 --> 01:04:26.054
[SPEAKER_02]: And free shipping.

01:04:28.135 --> 01:04:34.637
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as expected, there will be an In the Groove bundle, which will be the game, and an ignition pad.

01:04:34.657 --> 01:04:36.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be as glitchy as the arcade?

01:04:37.718 --> 01:04:38.338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

01:04:38.358 --> 01:04:39.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one of the features?

01:04:39.619 --> 01:04:40.139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

01:04:41.573 --> 01:04:44.536
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I figured out about In The Groove for the first time when I was playing yesterday?

01:04:45.597 --> 01:04:55.125
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually sit and you watch the attract mode, it actually shows pictures of all the people who made the game, and then like pictures of all these people gathered up at the arcade.

01:04:56.341 --> 01:04:59.263
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw eight on the break in there, and I was like, oh, I played that machine.

01:04:59.303 --> 01:04:59.883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

01:05:00.063 --> 01:05:07.267
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of neat in a way, but at the same time, I was kind of like, wow, these guys credit themselves as step chart makers.

01:05:07.667 --> 01:05:10.589
[SPEAKER_02]: They credit themselves in the credits of the game.

01:05:11.069 --> 01:05:13.590
[SPEAKER_02]: They credit themselves in the opening sequence of the game.

01:05:14.731 --> 01:05:19.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that you shouldn't get a little credit, because these games take a lot of work, but

01:05:21.201 --> 01:05:29.970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it seems like most other games I've played have a little bit of a hold warm when it comes to that stuff.

01:05:30.110 --> 01:05:31.671
[SPEAKER_02]: A little less, not so much.

01:05:33.373 --> 01:05:35.335
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:05:35.435 --> 01:05:37.077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get the hate mail.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:38.538
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dogging on in the group.

01:05:38.819 --> 01:05:41.081
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually starting to warm up to the game a little bit.

01:05:41.161 --> 01:05:44.264
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding the five songs I really like to play over and over again.

01:05:44.825 --> 01:05:45.025
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:05:45.949 --> 01:05:47.151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a good time.

01:05:47.211 --> 01:05:48.392
[SPEAKER_02]: And my scores are getting better.

01:05:48.733 --> 01:05:50.855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting used to that wacky scrolling thing.

01:05:51.416 --> 01:05:52.497
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it scrolls initially.

01:05:52.918 --> 01:05:54.820
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, you had to play in the group for the first time this week.

01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.261
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think?

01:05:56.405 --> 01:05:56.945
[SPEAKER_10]: I suck.

01:05:58.365 --> 01:05:59.286
[SPEAKER_10]: I suck bad.

01:05:59.786 --> 01:06:00.126
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

01:06:00.406 --> 01:06:10.427
[SPEAKER_10]: I find the arrows, like, really small for, you know, the way, because I can't see that well, and just, you know, having small arrows kind of makes it hard.

01:06:10.928 --> 01:06:13.448
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to follow by color, which doesn't exactly work.

01:06:14.208 --> 01:06:22.510
[SPEAKER_10]: But I figure with practice I will try to get better at the game, assuming we get to go again.

01:06:22.810 --> 01:06:24.590
[SPEAKER_10]: So, other than that,

01:06:25.720 --> 01:06:28.821
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know any of the music or anything, so that didn't help.

01:06:28.881 --> 01:06:30.442
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was like, pick a song, pick a song.

01:06:30.462 --> 01:06:32.823
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know what I want to play, just pick one.

01:06:34.843 --> 01:06:40.865
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess as I play the game, I'll get to know the songs and I'll feel a little bit more comfortable with it.

01:06:42.046 --> 01:06:44.066
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, yeah, it's okay.

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:49.308
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a rip-off, but it's still okay.

01:06:49.428 --> 01:06:51.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew, you got to play it for the first time as well.

01:06:51.089 --> 01:06:52.269
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your thoughts on IndieGroove?

01:06:53.322 --> 01:06:54.723
[SPEAKER_25]: That was pretty well done.

01:06:54.743 --> 01:07:02.450
[SPEAKER_25]: It did seem a little bit glitchy, but actually it plays like a finished product.

01:07:02.510 --> 01:07:04.872
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, glitchy is a very vague word.

01:07:04.892 --> 01:07:05.932
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean with glitchy?

01:07:07.574 --> 01:07:13.719
[SPEAKER_25]: Just some basic timing stuff, because I was listening to the songs and some steps just didn't match.

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:16.942
[SPEAKER_25]: So it mostly could be just a step chart problem.

01:07:16.962 --> 01:07:18.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that's a step chart glitch.

01:07:19.023 --> 01:07:22.266
[SPEAKER_25]: Could be just step charts to me, but it actually plays like a finished product.

01:07:25.950 --> 01:07:26.030
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.R.

01:07:50.807 --> 01:07:55.229
[SPEAKER_02]: Just patron of an arcade, a teenager, they're all the same.

01:07:55.289 --> 01:08:02.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not giving the average user of the arcade enough credit, but I always thought every dance game was the same to most people that aren't in this scene.

01:08:05.392 --> 01:08:08.733
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I've always said, one leg up that DDR has on In the Groove.

01:08:09.073 --> 01:08:10.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Does In the Groove have more challenging steps?

01:08:10.814 --> 01:08:11.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:08:11.054 --> 01:08:11.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have a

01:08:12.395 --> 01:08:14.436
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR is all sweetness and light and candy!

01:08:37.172 --> 01:08:39.313
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I think that attracts people to it more.

01:08:40.814 --> 01:08:41.954
[SPEAKER_02]: In a completely superficial way.

01:08:41.974 --> 01:08:44.815
[SPEAKER_09]: It brings people out of the dark shadows that are with their lives.

01:08:45.215 --> 01:08:47.076
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing is, it looked very plain.

01:08:48.357 --> 01:08:49.357
[SPEAKER_03]: Very plain.

01:08:49.877 --> 01:08:51.698
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just even the arrows are plain.

01:08:51.938 --> 01:08:53.199
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface is plain.

01:08:53.259 --> 01:08:54.019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just plain.

01:08:54.859 --> 01:08:59.261
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whereas you can get some interfaces like a lot of the Step Mania skins I've seen out there.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:00.882
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really cool looking.

01:09:01.162 --> 01:09:03.083
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really, you know, complex looking.

01:09:03.143 --> 01:09:05.704
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really, you know, like, wow, I gotta play that game.

01:09:05.744 --> 01:09:06.404
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks cool.

01:09:07.136 --> 01:09:11.138
[SPEAKER_03]: versus, wow, it's another dancing game.

01:09:11.518 --> 01:09:12.079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

01:09:13.299 --> 01:09:21.604
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we've got to include all this crap to get you to buy this game because we're going to fail when it comes to selling against DDR.

01:09:21.924 --> 01:09:22.284
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

01:09:22.324 --> 01:09:26.887
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to buy this game because they're going to be like, oh, I've got to put it in the group so they make more games.

01:09:28.327 --> 01:09:29.208
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, no.

01:09:29.728 --> 01:09:31.049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whatever.

01:09:31.649 --> 01:09:33.370
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious to see how it plays.

01:09:34.690 --> 01:09:39.152
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see how it plays out, too, because I think it is going to be competition.

01:09:39.492 --> 01:09:40.732
[SPEAKER_02]: We got into this a couple weeks ago.

01:09:40.772 --> 01:09:47.694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to revisit, but I think the Red Octane partnership is going to prove it's going to make in the group some serious competition.

01:09:47.734 --> 01:09:48.235
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

01:09:48.575 --> 01:09:51.676
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the game is good enough, certainly, where it can.

01:09:52.236 --> 01:09:59.158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're talking it's Mad Catz dance craze or whatever that fucking game was on GameCube that sucks.

01:09:59.418 --> 01:10:00.799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good dance game.

01:10:00.859 --> 01:10:01.719
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have flaws?

01:10:02.179 --> 01:10:02.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:10:02.859 --> 01:10:03.640
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it good?

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:04.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it solid?

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:05.860
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly so.

01:10:06.701 --> 01:10:08.321
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

01:10:09.102 --> 01:10:09.542
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

01:10:11.122 --> 01:10:13.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I'm getting blink, blink, blinks.

01:10:14.784 --> 01:10:15.184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:10:15.944 --> 01:10:19.586
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll do a break time, then we'll come back, maybe do some Skype line.

01:10:19.906 --> 01:10:20.446
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?

01:10:21.227 --> 01:10:22.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Let our listeners talk back?

01:10:22.247 --> 01:10:22.667
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, good work.

01:10:22.967 --> 01:10:23.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll do that.

01:10:23.808 --> 01:10:26.729
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back, we're going to let you guys interact with our show.

01:10:26.749 --> 01:10:33.171
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and we'll be taking some calls when we get back from this break.

01:10:33.692 --> 01:10:34.532
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break...

01:10:35.632 --> 01:10:40.054
[SPEAKER_02]: Pope Puri, whatever I feel like playing, and whatever Jamie tells me to play.

01:10:41.015 --> 01:10:46.458
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start it off with, since we've been doing 2DX all night, I think it's time to do some DDR.

01:10:48.539 --> 01:10:50.199
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:51.740
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get that in there, Jamie.

01:10:52.761 --> 01:10:57.203
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start it off with, I want to start off with something from Xtreme.

01:10:57.863 --> 01:10:59.204
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some Blue Impulse.

01:11:01.125 --> 01:11:02.746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck, I have a story about Bag.

01:11:02.766 --> 01:11:02.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:11:05.124 --> 01:11:05.925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell the bags.

01:11:06.005 --> 01:11:08.287
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do the break of songs everybody hates.

01:11:08.567 --> 01:11:09.307
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you want to do that?

01:11:09.367 --> 01:11:09.828
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

01:11:10.088 --> 01:11:11.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, forget Blue Impulse then.

01:11:11.389 --> 01:11:11.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them move.

01:11:14.091 --> 01:11:15.872
[SPEAKER_05]: No, except let them move because that song's been banned.

01:11:16.913 --> 01:11:17.173
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:11:17.333 --> 01:11:18.174
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be a balloon.

01:11:19.455 --> 01:11:20.616
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that song's been banned too.

01:11:20.916 --> 01:11:21.416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, banned.

01:11:21.756 --> 01:11:23.958
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a break of songs we hate.

01:11:24.558 --> 01:11:24.859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

01:11:25.359 --> 01:11:27.200
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:11:28.241 --> 01:11:29.602
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to give me a minute to queue these up.

01:11:29.662 --> 01:11:30.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what song are we starting off with?

01:11:30.963 --> 01:11:31.503
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

01:11:31.724 --> 01:11:32.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:11:34.190 --> 01:11:35.871
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished the bag of gummy bears.

01:11:36.471 --> 01:11:37.111
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you now?

01:11:37.611 --> 01:11:38.031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.

01:11:38.151 --> 01:11:38.751
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta get more.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:39.972
[SPEAKER_05]: How long did that take?

01:11:40.012 --> 01:11:40.332
[SPEAKER_05]: A month?

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:41.792
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even.

01:11:41.952 --> 01:11:43.853
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a couple, like a week or so.

01:11:45.233 --> 01:11:45.653
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks.

01:11:45.893 --> 01:11:51.295
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have, strangely enough, I only have bag from the non-stop.

01:11:52.635 --> 01:11:53.736
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really scary?

01:11:53.756 --> 01:11:54.256
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll do it.

01:11:54.296 --> 01:11:54.516
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

01:11:55.196 --> 01:11:57.857
[SPEAKER_03]: They played Junior today on SyFy.

01:11:57.877 --> 01:11:58.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anyway.

01:11:59.917 --> 01:12:00.857
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

01:12:00.997 --> 01:12:02.258
[SPEAKER_02]: A break of dinner songs we hate.

01:12:02.278 --> 01:12:02.698
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

01:13:21.756 --> 01:13:28.222
[SPEAKER_17]: Check one, check one, when I come down, I come down right to the sun.

01:13:28.262 --> 01:13:30.604
Get right down, get right down to the gym.

01:13:49.861 --> 01:13:51.943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kicking the boat, don't you know, Bobby Joe?

01:13:52.303 --> 01:14:01.891
[SPEAKER_15]: When I come around, I get down, when I get down, I'm down Get right down, I'm down I said one, two, three, four Come on, y'all, I get on the floor Get right down, get right down, I'm down, I'm down

01:14:20.151 --> 01:14:21.012
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

01:14:42.109 --> 01:14:43.270
Thank you for watching

01:15:10.376 --> 01:15:11.477
[SPEAKER_15]: Blow my whistle, baby.

01:15:11.497 --> 01:15:12.657
[SPEAKER_15]: Blow my whistle, baby.

01:15:12.677 --> 01:15:14.378
Open up and put it in.

01:15:14.418 --> 01:15:15.079
Let's begin.

01:15:52.158 --> 01:15:53.140
Let me hear you sing!

01:16:39.100 --> 01:16:40.170
[SPEAKER_15]: Slow my whistle baby

01:18:15.456 --> 01:18:18.662
[SPEAKER_26]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

01:18:18.942 --> 01:18:19.423
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

01:18:21.226 --> 01:18:21.887
[SPEAKER_26]: Just kidding.

01:18:22.308 --> 01:18:24.973
[SPEAKER_26]: Orange Lounge Radio, Crap Free Bavani Radio.

01:18:26.966 --> 01:18:28.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag is a horde song.

01:18:55.595 --> 01:19:04.143
[SPEAKER_02]: People play Bagged to Death because it's a ten-footer, and they'll play it on three-speed, and then when they pass it, they're like, oh my gods, I passed a ten-footer.

01:19:04.883 --> 01:19:12.030
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, because of the way the song sounds, it's one of those songs you can hear from across the arcade when somebody's playing it.

01:19:15.133 --> 01:19:18.896
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh god, somebody's trying to pass a ten-footer over there.

01:19:19.326 --> 01:19:26.955
[SPEAKER_08]: Even real bagpipe music when you're standing next to the pipist, the piper, sorry, does not sound as annoying.

01:19:27.615 --> 01:19:36.265
[SPEAKER_08]: I love bagpipe music, not when I'm standing right next to the piper, because then it's deafening, but I would rather go deaf from listening to real bagpipes.

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:37.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheng Ma, Love This Feelin'

01:20:04.352 --> 01:20:05.233
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:20:24.828 --> 01:20:34.266
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, and correct me if I'm wrong on this statement, and I'm sure the chat room will, but I believe it was the first DDR song that had a tempo change.

01:20:35.848 --> 01:20:36.009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

01:20:36.568 --> 01:20:40.452
[SPEAKER_02]: and now, tempo changes are really horrid in DDR.

01:20:40.872 --> 01:20:55.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was playing Ultramix 2 online today, I was playing some Controller, Controller Revolution, but I, just to cover my ass here, I specifically looked for a room on Ultramix that said Controller Fun, so that we would, you know, be playing with controller people, so I wouldn't, you know, be playing with pad people.

01:20:55.886 --> 01:20:55.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

01:20:56.867 --> 01:20:58.968
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Alligator Project, The Whistle Song

01:21:20.909 --> 01:21:22.669
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that song so much.

01:21:22.970 --> 01:21:25.150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, again, it's just horrid.

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:28.551
[SPEAKER_02]: And the song is Blow My Whistle Bitch.

01:21:29.211 --> 01:21:32.291
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like the fact that they censored it in the actual song.

01:21:32.551 --> 01:21:33.972
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't censor the background.

01:21:34.112 --> 01:21:36.192
[SPEAKER_02]: It still says Blow My Whistle Bitch, but they censored the song.

01:21:36.412 --> 01:21:39.373
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they have both versions on his album.

01:21:39.453 --> 01:21:41.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have his album.

01:21:41.913 --> 01:21:42.353
[SPEAKER_03]: The vinyl.

01:21:42.453 --> 01:21:43.514
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, why?

01:21:45.394 --> 01:21:47.595
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was collecting DDR music.

01:21:47.815 --> 01:21:48.355
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, whatever.

01:21:48.675 --> 01:21:49.635
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose I can let that slide.

01:21:50.819 --> 01:21:51.899
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another one of those songs.

01:21:51.920 --> 01:22:03.645
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear it from across the arcade, and I swear to God, you could be sitting over on, like, Derby Owners Club or something, you can hear, wee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.

01:22:04.425 --> 01:22:06.446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh God, somebody saw off the machine.

01:22:06.786 --> 01:22:07.366
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

01:22:07.766 --> 01:22:11.028
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing would be fun to play, like, Bag 2.

01:22:11.628 --> 01:22:12.729
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Final Furlong.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:15.950
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we played Max 300.

01:22:20.919 --> 01:22:24.321
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:22:48.197 --> 01:22:48.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:50.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:22:52.924 --> 01:23:01.116
[SPEAKER_02]: As promised, we are going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys that want to give a little bit of feedback on the program.

01:23:01.156 --> 01:23:02.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you have something you want to share with us.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:04.161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:23:05.309 --> 01:23:08.231
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:26.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Echo123 Echo123 Hey Sky, Siggy here Just woke up, as usual

01:23:53.080 --> 01:23:55.801
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must be pretty excited about the 9th style coming out this week.

01:23:56.141 --> 01:23:57.062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yes.

01:23:57.262 --> 01:23:59.683
[SPEAKER_02]: And the early release news, that's pretty exciting.

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:04.985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, according to PlayAsia, they released it today in Hong Kong.

01:24:05.765 --> 01:24:07.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, very interesting.

01:24:07.506 --> 01:24:07.906
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:24:09.067 --> 01:24:11.528
[SPEAKER_04]: The release date is March 21st, which is tomorrow.

01:24:12.008 --> 01:24:12.348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:24:13.989 --> 01:24:19.431
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I get into the 9th style business, I just want to say some local news here in Vegas.

01:24:20.143 --> 01:24:25.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, we appreciate local news, because we talk about Sacramento way too much on this show, so we need to hear from other communities.

01:24:25.986 --> 01:24:26.767
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up in Vegas?

01:24:27.427 --> 01:24:29.968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, um, how should I say it?

01:24:30.209 --> 01:24:33.831
[SPEAKER_04]: Circus Circus Adventure Dome's gonna get 2DX Red by tomorrow.

01:24:34.591 --> 01:24:36.352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my, that's very interesting.

01:24:36.492 --> 01:24:40.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I usually stay at Circus Circus when I go to Vegas, because it's fucking cheap.

01:24:41.815 --> 01:24:45.377
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been to the Adventure Dome, um...

01:24:46.135 --> 01:24:51.538
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I think that was one of the first places... Actually, the first place I ever played DDR was Circus Circus, but it wasn't in the Adventure Dome.

01:24:51.858 --> 01:24:53.279
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the arcade they had there.

01:24:53.699 --> 01:24:54.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Midway.

01:24:54.520 --> 01:24:54.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:24:55.140 --> 01:24:56.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, the Midway area.

01:24:57.281 --> 01:24:57.501
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

01:24:57.922 --> 01:24:59.362
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting 2DX Red, huh?

01:24:59.903 --> 01:25:00.103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

01:25:00.443 --> 01:25:01.383
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Adventure Dome.

01:25:01.403 --> 01:25:02.204
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so weird to me.

01:25:02.724 --> 01:25:04.965
[SPEAKER_02]: What caused them to decide to jump there?

01:25:05.065 --> 01:25:06.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they been successful with 8-Style, or...?

01:25:07.447 --> 01:25:09.428
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's probably the locals.

01:25:09.848 --> 01:25:11.109
[SPEAKER_04]: The locals have been demanding it.

01:25:11.809 --> 01:25:12.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

01:25:13.010 --> 01:25:13.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

01:25:14.030 --> 01:25:15.011
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to let us know how that goes.

01:25:16.107 --> 01:25:17.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure thing.

01:25:17.128 --> 01:25:18.168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take pictures.

01:25:19.609 --> 01:25:21.110
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else to share with the Vegas scene?

01:25:22.111 --> 01:25:23.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's only about it.

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:24.193
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

01:25:24.413 --> 01:25:29.796
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already, you know, some news about getting in the groove here in Vegas.

01:25:30.297 --> 01:25:31.337
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know which arcade.

01:25:32.638 --> 01:25:32.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:38.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, with in the groove 2 coming out just around the corner, maybe you guys ought to hold off at this point.

01:25:39.483 --> 01:25:39.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

01:25:40.324 --> 01:25:42.645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an in the groove person, so... Yeah, I know.

01:25:42.865 --> 01:25:43.346
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how it is.

01:25:44.486 --> 01:25:45.167
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel your pain.

01:25:45.814 --> 01:25:47.734
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, let's get into Nightstyle.

01:25:47.774 --> 01:25:48.334
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's.

01:25:48.935 --> 01:25:56.376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post a link to the website, to a website that has pictures of Nightstyle in it.

01:25:56.956 --> 01:26:01.417
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, alright, so you can read that in our chat room, www.orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.

01:26:01.777 --> 01:26:03.157
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the link, I just saw it pop up.

01:26:04.497 --> 01:26:09.798
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about Nightstyle CS is, you know, the main menu is actually mode select.

01:26:12.599 --> 01:26:13.859
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the arcade mode select.

01:26:14.215 --> 01:26:17.717
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm trying to bring it up myself over here right now.

01:26:18.137 --> 01:26:20.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is weird because all the pictures are on its side.

01:26:21.119 --> 01:26:23.280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, tilt your head.

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:24.841
[SPEAKER_02]: I tilt my monitor here.

01:26:25.341 --> 01:26:28.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so the main select screen is... Mode select.

01:26:28.623 --> 01:26:29.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Mode select, that's kind of weird.

01:26:30.864 --> 01:26:32.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the actual picture of it.

01:26:34.186 --> 01:26:36.687
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me paste it to... Okay.

01:26:37.848 --> 01:26:38.108
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

01:26:46.795 --> 01:26:49.008
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the main screen, huh, when you turn on the game?

01:26:50.094 --> 01:26:50.476
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, wow

01:26:51.556 --> 01:26:54.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the main menu screen has various options on it.

01:26:54.978 --> 01:26:56.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Free, training, original, gallery.

01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:02.023
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of what you're used to seeing, but the way it's set up, it almost looks like you're just jumping right into the game.

01:27:02.464 --> 01:27:08.247
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no, you know, fancy... Like, I don't know, like, Sixth Style kind of had its own fancy menu.

01:27:08.488 --> 01:27:10.229
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that sounds rushed.

01:27:11.029 --> 01:27:12.711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least we're getting it.

01:27:12.811 --> 01:27:13.871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't complain.

01:27:13.891 --> 01:27:15.012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least we're getting it.

01:27:15.312 --> 01:27:17.434
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, at least that car has three of its wheels.

01:27:17.594 --> 01:27:18.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

01:27:20.492 --> 01:27:21.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's interesting.

01:27:22.193 --> 01:27:22.433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

01:27:22.933 --> 01:27:37.239
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the music list, on the official Nine Style CS website, on the very bottom, it says that number 13, Beyond the Earth, and Sakuretsu, Yega Denko Chop, or Yega Final Attack, are three unlovable songs.

01:27:37.259 --> 01:27:38.060
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like me.

01:27:40.381 --> 01:27:41.901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's cool.

01:27:42.602 --> 01:27:43.742
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised by the number 13.

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:50.165
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd heard the thing, I think you had mentioned it a couple weeks ago, but to see that officially, that was pretty neat.

01:27:52.679 --> 01:27:54.941
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm interested to hear the new Jaeger.

01:27:55.202 --> 01:27:57.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the MP3s leaked to the internet yet?

01:27:58.104 --> 01:27:58.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

01:27:58.685 --> 01:28:00.066
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time, my friend.

01:28:01.947 --> 01:28:03.669
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably within this week or next week.

01:28:04.062 --> 01:28:04.542
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:28:30.856 --> 01:28:37.119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm quite happy that some songs that made a comeback on Night Style CS, for example, like Empathy.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:40.841
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little surprised by the comeback list, too.

01:28:40.881 --> 01:28:49.385
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some good things in it, and then there were songs like V, where I'm like, God damn, do we need V again?

01:28:50.086 --> 01:28:58.210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with V. I'm over V. I never played a comic concept before.

01:28:58.732 --> 01:29:01.493
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a fun one.

01:29:01.573 --> 01:29:05.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the one that slows down suddenly and then speeds up?

01:29:06.694 --> 01:29:10.355
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was one of the first songs I saw on 2DX, was that song.

01:29:10.375 --> 01:29:12.095
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that song is hot.

01:29:12.115 --> 01:29:15.256
[SPEAKER_04]: You just wanted to say that so you could pronounce it and show your little...

01:29:25.785 --> 01:29:27.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Manatsu no Hana, Manatsu no Yume by Sana

01:29:53.817 --> 01:30:01.664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I just... Take it as a compliment, take it as a compliment, that I'm just, I'm doing the blinking thing, I can't understand, I'm sorry.

01:30:02.224 --> 01:30:03.485
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright.

01:30:04.766 --> 01:30:07.188
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are you going to call us next week and let us know what you think about it?

01:30:07.929 --> 01:30:09.270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yeah, I'll call you next week.

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:13.053
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, do that, because we're poor, so we have to live vicariously through other folks.

01:30:13.613 --> 01:30:16.496
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hoping Jamie will have it soon, and she'll bring it over and let us all play.

01:30:16.956 --> 01:30:18.998
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get it, I'll know my birthday's next month.

01:30:21.744 --> 01:30:24.689
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said I'm poor, don't be looking at me.

01:30:24.769 --> 01:30:25.270
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

01:30:25.971 --> 01:30:26.272
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:30:26.933 --> 01:30:28.035
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well thanks for the call, Siggy.

01:30:28.055 --> 01:30:28.656
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a good one.

01:30:29.116 --> 01:30:29.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:30:29.517 --> 01:30:29.777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:30:30.218 --> 01:30:30.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

01:30:32.165 --> 01:30:33.166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:30:54.847 --> 01:30:57.127
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in our chatroom.

01:30:57.547 --> 01:30:58.148
[SPEAKER_02]: And send us $5.

01:30:58.788 --> 01:30:59.748
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't have to send us $5.

01:30:59.968 --> 01:31:00.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to Loki.

01:31:01.328 --> 01:31:02.088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all free.

01:31:02.108 --> 01:31:05.689
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in our chatroom to vote.

01:31:05.949 --> 01:31:06.589
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way it works.

01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:07.309
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into it.

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:13.030
[SPEAKER_02]: In last week's cage match, we had a brand new winner.

01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:16.571
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we've had a couple one-week victories lately.

01:31:16.671 --> 01:31:19.591
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if this one will win for one week or if it'll hold on.

01:31:20.291 --> 01:31:22.692
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a remix of an old-school 90s song.

01:31:24.190 --> 01:31:25.030
[SPEAKER_02]: What Is Love?

01:31:25.351 --> 01:31:26.051
[SPEAKER_02]: by Hataway.

01:31:26.131 --> 01:31:26.991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's What Is Love?

01:31:27.331 --> 01:31:28.112
[SPEAKER_02]: Reloaded.

01:31:28.632 --> 01:31:31.073
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see what you guys think about this one.

01:31:32.834 --> 01:31:34.535
[SPEAKER_02]: You did vote it as your winner last week.

01:31:34.595 --> 01:31:36.816
[SPEAKER_02]: You may vote it again tonight, or you may not.

01:31:36.936 --> 01:31:37.676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you guys.

01:31:38.537 --> 01:31:44.459
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder, we only play a clip of the first song because you got to hear the song in its entirety last week.

01:31:45.119 --> 01:31:48.141
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to let this segment only take up a little bit of time.

01:31:48.181 --> 01:31:50.002
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to take up all day.

01:31:50.422 --> 01:31:50.542
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

01:31:51.209 --> 01:31:52.650
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

01:32:24.111 --> 01:32:24.693
What is love?

01:33:03.857 --> 01:33:13.524
I don't know why you're not there I give you my love but you don't care So what is right and what is wrong?

01:33:13.864 --> 01:33:17.326
Give me a sign What is love?

01:33:17.366 --> 01:33:28.694

01:34:01.246 --> 01:34:05.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number one, last week's winner, Hadaway, What Is Love.

01:34:06.810 --> 01:34:12.994
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see if it wins again tonight, or if it will bow down to one of our two other entries tonight.

01:34:13.094 --> 01:34:14.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with Loki's pick.

01:34:15.336 --> 01:34:17.117
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

01:34:18.278 --> 01:34:25.463
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked our fellow friend and Kumani artist, MidiHead.

01:34:25.603 --> 01:34:30.446
[SPEAKER_03]: He released an exclusive track to us people that bought his albums.

01:34:31.461 --> 01:34:34.684
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for you guys, it's White Knuckle Ride.

01:34:35.144 --> 01:34:36.405

[SPEAKER_02]: White Knuckle Ride

01:37:15.394 --> 01:37:15.979
Thanks for watching!

01:38:47.813 --> 01:38:48.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm here.

01:38:48.534 --> 01:38:48.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:38:49.815 --> 01:38:52.016
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a picto chat orgy here in the studio.

01:38:52.036 --> 01:38:53.858
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to take a break from it for a minute.

01:38:54.378 --> 01:38:58.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that was song number two, Midi Head, White Knuckle Ride.

01:38:58.982 --> 01:38:59.783
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

01:39:01.024 --> 01:39:02.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with DarkSakura.

01:39:02.345 --> 01:39:03.646
[SPEAKER_08]: I still hate that man's voice.

01:39:03.966 --> 01:39:04.266
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

01:39:04.647 --> 01:39:05.688
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's so cool.

01:39:05.828 --> 01:39:06.448
[SPEAKER_08]: He's cool.

01:39:06.488 --> 01:39:07.289
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

01:39:07.889 --> 01:39:09.090
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't like his voice.

01:39:09.631 --> 01:39:10.972
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he can sing very well.

01:39:11.693 --> 01:39:14.475
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it would have had a ten.

01:39:15.967 --> 01:39:17.888
[SPEAKER_08]: By virtue of voice, it gets an 8 instead.

01:39:18.368 --> 01:39:18.728
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:39:19.949 --> 01:39:20.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a mic over there?

01:39:21.809 --> 01:39:22.209
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

01:39:26.831 --> 01:39:31.872
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a steaming pile of poo, but... It's alright.

01:39:32.193 --> 01:39:32.973
[SPEAKER_25]: Probably gets a 7.

01:39:33.213 --> 01:39:35.834
[SPEAKER_25]: It's got a good beat behind it, though.

01:39:38.295 --> 01:39:39.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Angel.

01:39:40.555 --> 01:39:40.715
Ow.

01:39:41.456 --> 01:39:41.996
[SPEAKER_10]: Head rush.

01:39:42.116 --> 01:39:42.596
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um...

01:39:44.458 --> 01:39:48.041
[SPEAKER_10]: 8 because I like mini heads and stuff.

01:39:48.361 --> 01:39:50.582
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bye.

01:39:50.682 --> 01:39:53.464
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally, I actually thought that song was pretty fucking rad.

01:39:53.604 --> 01:39:55.225
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of his better tracks.

01:39:55.446 --> 01:39:57.127
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to keep that one for myself.

01:39:57.767 --> 01:39:59.208
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give it a 9.5.

01:40:00.009 --> 01:40:00.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

01:40:01.089 --> 01:40:02.971
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, there's a microphone being shoved in my face.

01:40:04.051 --> 01:40:07.193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool.

01:40:07.394 --> 01:40:07.794
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

01:40:07.874 --> 01:40:08.454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I picked it.

01:40:10.135 --> 01:40:10.796
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a 10.

01:40:11.716 --> 01:40:12.417
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

01:40:13.854 --> 01:40:15.555
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into song number three.

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:18.178
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three is DarkSakura's pick.

01:40:18.238 --> 01:40:19.359
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you pick for us tonight?

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:23.482
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I like Yoko Kanno.

01:40:23.522 --> 01:40:25.844
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really cool and she's a neat person in person.

01:40:26.404 --> 01:40:31.268
[SPEAKER_08]: She signed our Macross Plus CD at AX like a while back.

01:40:31.969 --> 01:40:34.391
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, anyway, this is one from, uh,

01:40:36.006 --> 01:40:39.709
[SPEAKER_08]: She did this on the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex.

01:40:39.829 --> 01:40:40.629
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rise.

01:40:41.270 --> 01:40:45.092
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember who sent it to me because I think it's in the chat room right now, but I don't remember, so sorry.

01:40:45.973 --> 01:40:46.353
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:40:47.273 --> 01:40:48.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoko Kanno, Rise.

01:40:49.155 --> 01:40:49.495
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

01:41:18.792 --> 01:41:23.056
I'm a soldier, that's it, yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah, yeah

01:42:04.107 --> 01:42:04.412
Thank you.

01:44:30.959 --> 01:44:31.539
S, Actdeft,

01:46:21.684 --> 01:46:25.967
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number three there, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

01:46:26.127 --> 01:46:29.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that one rise to the cage match occasion, or did it fall flat on its ass?

01:46:30.009 --> 01:46:30.750
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Jamie.

01:46:31.130 --> 01:46:33.512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yoko Kanno is awesome, so this one gets a nine and a half.

01:46:34.752 --> 01:46:35.093
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

01:46:35.973 --> 01:46:37.834
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty nice, I'd say eight.

01:46:38.615 --> 01:46:39.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Angel.

01:46:41.657 --> 01:46:41.837
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight.

01:46:43.298 --> 01:46:46.240
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like that a lot, it sounded like it should be in the fifth element.

01:46:46.340 --> 01:46:46.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine.

01:46:47.380 --> 01:46:47.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

01:46:50.643 --> 01:46:51.183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a seven.

01:46:52.765 --> 01:46:56.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but remember, our votes don't count for shit.

01:46:57.048 --> 01:46:59.269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all up to you guys to pick a wiener.

01:47:00.209 --> 01:47:04.792
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you go, three songs for you to pick from.

01:47:05.352 --> 01:47:09.435
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Hadaway, What Is Love, Reloaded.

01:47:15.958 --> 01:47:21.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Midi Head with White Knuckle Ride.

01:47:29.918 --> 01:47:34.080
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

01:47:42.423 --> 01:47:45.445
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a very hard cage match to decide tonight.

01:47:45.465 --> 01:47:49.066
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got three really good songs in here tonight, so this is going to be an interesting one.

01:47:49.766 --> 01:47:51.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now.

01:47:51.907 --> 01:47:55.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:47:56.883 --> 01:48:03.787
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know the chatroom likes to bitch a lot, that sometimes we give them three crappy songs to pick from, but I seriously don't think you can complain about that tonight.

01:48:04.187 --> 01:48:19.216
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some old school beats there with the What Is Love, you've got some new school, like industrial sounding stuff with a midi head, and then you've got the J, like, I don't want to call it J-pop, but the J-opera rock or something, I don't know, with the Yoko Kanno.

01:48:19.256 --> 01:48:22.958
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely something to choose from, from every spectrum there, some good songs.

01:48:23.019 --> 01:48:25.420
[SPEAKER_02]: So good luck you guys trying to figure that one out, should be a close one.

01:48:26.038 --> 01:48:27.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote.

01:48:28.665 --> 01:48:29.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting some votes in right now.

01:48:31.042 --> 01:48:35.105
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question from AsianBuddyPaul in our chat room.

01:48:35.485 --> 01:48:39.728
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to check in on the Ultracade kicking gallery that we're going to have.

01:48:40.348 --> 01:48:42.649
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to work on that last week.

01:48:42.669 --> 01:48:51.615
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a photo from one of our other listeners send in a photo of him kicking an Ultracade machine and was wondering where you can send in those pictures.

01:48:52.035 --> 01:48:54.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Send those to Rob at OrangeLandRadio.com.

01:48:54.617 --> 01:48:56.738
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and just take charge with setting up the gallery.

01:48:57.058 --> 01:48:57.959
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead and send those.

01:48:58.019 --> 01:48:59.640
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to send them to Jamie...

01:49:00.100 --> 01:49:03.626
[SPEAKER_02]: or Matt, they will make sure I get them or they'll get them in the gallery themselves.

01:49:03.767 --> 01:49:04.708
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can go ahead and send those to me.

01:49:04.768 --> 01:49:10.738
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob at OrangeLawnRadio.com In fact, I'm kind of curious if he sent it already because if he did, I want to show it to the folks in the studio.

01:49:11.079 --> 01:49:12.021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love...

01:49:12.865 --> 01:49:14.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultracade kicking pictures.

01:49:14.505 --> 01:49:21.827
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, please remind Loki or Jamie, I know you're both in on this, why should folks be sending us pictures of them kicking Ultracade machines?

01:49:21.947 --> 01:49:29.168
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Ultracade is trying to trademark the MAME name, because MAME already belongs to somebody else.

01:49:30.028 --> 01:49:32.969
[SPEAKER_08]: So this person is a big retard, so we have to kick Ultracade machines.

01:49:33.129 --> 01:49:33.809
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, look at that.

01:49:33.969 --> 01:49:34.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely kick.

01:49:34.849 --> 01:49:35.869
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even a kick.

01:49:35.889 --> 01:49:38.290
[SPEAKER_02]: They are kicking the actual panel there.

01:49:38.945 --> 01:49:40.646
[SPEAKER_02]: That owns.

01:49:40.786 --> 01:49:43.508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a you-could-get-busted in the arcade picture right there.

01:49:43.608 --> 01:49:46.389
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, our buddy Paul there, for sending us that.

01:49:46.409 --> 01:49:46.990
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great pick.

01:49:47.570 --> 01:49:51.532
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, the abuse of these cabinets is going to have to take.

01:49:51.753 --> 01:49:56.575
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't actually kick the Altercade components, because, I mean, Altercade is put in these cabinets.

01:49:57.056 --> 01:49:59.617
[SPEAKER_03]: The cabinets have no say what games inside of them.

01:49:59.757 --> 01:50:01.658
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick the right side where it hits the JAMA harness.

01:50:02.379 --> 01:50:04.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have to kick the JAMA harness.

01:50:04.861 --> 01:50:11.027
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but actually just kick any part of it, because a lot of these cabins are sold with it already in there, so... You know what?

01:50:12.228 --> 01:50:13.510
[SPEAKER_03]: They're guilty by association.

01:50:13.530 --> 01:50:14.931
[SPEAKER_25]: Think of the cabinets, though.

01:50:15.131 --> 01:50:18.554
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get busted... No, I want the disclaimer here.

01:50:20.236 --> 01:50:21.818
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not tell you to do this.

01:50:23.139 --> 01:50:25.501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get angry letters from your arcade owner.

01:50:25.521 --> 01:50:26.222
[SPEAKER_02]: You should...

01:50:29.249 --> 01:50:36.451
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pose like you're kicking the machine, but don't really kick it because we don't want to get your arcade owners upset.

01:50:36.751 --> 01:50:39.932
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you do, and if they're mad, we don't know you.

01:50:39.952 --> 01:50:40.593
[SPEAKER_25]: And we disown you.

01:50:40.613 --> 01:50:41.353
[SPEAKER_25]: You were never here.

01:50:41.473 --> 01:50:41.933
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

01:50:43.934 --> 01:50:44.314
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

01:50:48.615 --> 01:50:55.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you know I always ask you this around this time of the show, and even if there's no news, I have to ask you anyway.

01:50:55.257 --> 01:50:57.898
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is going on in the sim scene, my friend?

01:50:59.201 --> 01:51:04.465
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on is this fucking AIM is attached to goddamn Outlook Express, and that makes me angry.

01:51:05.186 --> 01:51:06.907
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid Outlook and MAME.

01:51:07.268 --> 01:51:09.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, our... what our AIM.

01:51:10.110 --> 01:51:11.471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, SimZine.

01:51:11.971 --> 01:51:15.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, see, only a couple things are actually going on here.

01:51:15.534 --> 01:51:16.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Matrix Online launch update.

01:51:17.016 --> 01:51:20.879
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, there is... a couple things.

01:51:20.999 --> 01:51:24.782
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, TechnoFiend, they're working on yet another theme.

01:51:25.142 --> 01:51:25.963
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um...

01:51:26.519 --> 01:51:28.280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Techno Fiend Retroactive.

01:51:28.340 --> 01:51:31.142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a yellow version of Techno Fiend.

01:51:31.202 --> 01:51:32.983
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks kind of neat.

01:51:33.663 --> 01:51:36.825
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole thread on it on Bumicell, and that's supposed to be coming out.

01:51:37.245 --> 01:51:39.227
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing new on Funmix, too, as far as I'm aware.

01:51:39.907 --> 01:51:42.468
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to double check, just to be certain on that.

01:51:44.209 --> 01:51:49.873
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, also there's the... God, I can't even remember what it's called now.

01:51:51.034 --> 01:51:51.114
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

01:51:52.694 --> 01:51:53.334
[SPEAKER_03]: VIRTUAL VISIONS

01:52:11.460 --> 01:52:18.244
[SPEAKER_03]: and those are all video game remixes and they're making a step file pack for those and that's still going on right now.

01:52:18.685 --> 01:52:20.426
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a big huge forum now.

01:52:20.926 --> 01:52:24.589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a section of their forums that you can actually check out.

01:52:27.250 --> 01:52:32.233
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, DDR Maniacs is saying they're coming back whenever that is.

01:52:33.911 --> 01:52:58.401
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's supposedly gonna happen I mean, not that anyone really cares But MySell's talking about launching version 7 at some point So, and they promised, like, more stuff They remodel their site more than we get new Guitar Freaks arcade mixes Seriously So anyways, that's supposedly happening I checked today to see if there's a new version of Step Mania Guess what?

01:52:58.521 --> 01:52:58.861
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

01:52:59.802 --> 01:53:01.682
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have we been waiting for Step Mania 4.0?

01:53:01.722 --> 01:53:02.123
[SPEAKER_03]: How long?

01:53:03.504 --> 01:53:04.986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, that's what I'm saying.

01:53:05.266 --> 01:53:06.788
[SPEAKER_03]: No one even cares anymore, I think.

01:53:07.208 --> 01:53:08.750
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone actually play Setmania?

01:53:09.191 --> 01:53:09.491
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

01:53:09.791 --> 01:53:10.112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

01:53:10.392 --> 01:53:10.612
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

01:53:12.775 --> 01:53:14.997
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I'm trying to see right now.

01:53:15.318 --> 01:53:18.381
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go to the FoonMix page to see if there's anything going on there.

01:53:18.842 --> 01:53:23.226
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I suspect that there might be, but you know, I need to double check.

01:53:24.288 --> 01:53:24.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

01:53:25.572 --> 01:53:51.424
[SPEAKER_03]: I was downloading, though, there's, like, you know, you can get a lot of themes and stuff, um, on my, so they have a whole, you know, section and stuff for that, but, um, let's see, Foonmix, Foonmix, Foonmix, here we go, and, what do you know, no news for Foonmix, but it's, uh, Foonmix 2 is still in progress, no date for that, look forward to it coming out, though, pretty soon, I'd imagine, and,

01:53:51.829 --> 01:53:52.510
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

01:54:01.138 --> 01:54:04.199
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

01:54:04.219 --> 01:54:06.779
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRXX Mix.

01:54:07.519 --> 01:54:16.261
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about a release date for April 1st, I believe, was the release date for that one.

01:54:16.621 --> 01:54:23.082
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's supposed to be a big food mix type thing where there's a ton of different things to play.

01:54:23.522 --> 01:54:24.522
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was the one.

01:54:24.702 --> 01:54:26.242
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one of them that's launching April 1st.

01:54:26.282 --> 01:54:29.883
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember by chance which one that is, but I think it's that one.

01:54:31.071 --> 01:54:31.852
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

01:54:32.773 --> 01:54:39.258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's some other people they're releasing, which is kind of neat.

01:54:41.780 --> 01:54:47.964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's in the group stuff that's coming out right now, and then there's also sim files for...

01:54:51.021 --> 01:54:54.465
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max that are being released right now.

01:54:54.646 --> 01:54:56.167
[SPEAKER_03]: And the DJ Max songs are pretty cool.

01:54:57.008 --> 01:55:06.360
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, it's an online Beatmania-type game that was made by the creators of Easy to DJ, the other DJ game that's actually pretty good.

01:55:08.363 --> 01:55:08.723
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

01:55:11.119 --> 01:55:12.260
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you for that update.

01:55:12.280 --> 01:55:14.201
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot longer than I was expecting, actually.

01:55:14.301 --> 01:55:16.963
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's, eh, all the signs are down, nobody cares.

01:55:17.503 --> 01:55:20.805
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's nice to know that things are still alive and kicking in the sim scene.

01:55:20.825 --> 01:55:23.807
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to note to the winner of tonight's cage match?

01:55:24.408 --> 01:55:24.948
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

01:55:25.128 --> 01:55:31.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I thought this would be a very, very close cage match tonight because we had three very good songs.

01:55:31.812 --> 01:55:34.014
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, one of these songs just...

01:55:35.083 --> 01:55:38.224
[SPEAKER_02]: For lack of a better term, it really just blew the other two out of the water.

01:55:39.025 --> 01:55:40.025
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to say it.

01:55:40.745 --> 01:55:42.666
[SPEAKER_02]: But this song definitely won tonight.

01:55:42.866 --> 01:55:47.068
[SPEAKER_02]: It is... Yoko Kanno with Rise.

01:55:50.269 --> 01:55:52.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a pretty large portion of the vote tonight.

01:55:52.190 --> 01:55:52.891
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

01:55:52.991 --> 01:55:55.352
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize it would be a big gap.

01:55:55.492 --> 01:55:56.212
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't either.

01:55:56.732 --> 01:55:58.413
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sad by that.

01:55:59.333 --> 01:55:59.733
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

01:55:59.853 --> 01:56:00.614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming back.

01:56:02.274 --> 01:56:03.395
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.

01:56:05.462 --> 01:56:10.943
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there it is, song number three, Yoko Kanno, Enjoy.

01:56:12.083 --> 01:56:16.824
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be back next week, and we'll see how it fares next week.

01:56:18.344 --> 01:56:22.905
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving right along, should I do another Skype call now, or should I wait?

01:56:23.005 --> 01:56:24.525
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if anybody else wants to call in.

01:56:25.425 --> 01:56:26.246
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll open it up.

01:56:26.286 --> 01:56:26.926
[SPEAKER_27]: I say break.

01:56:27.466 --> 01:56:28.066
[SPEAKER_02]: You say break?

01:56:28.286 --> 01:56:28.546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

01:56:28.726 --> 01:56:29.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, we'll do a break.

01:56:31.286 --> 01:56:32.307
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to break?

01:56:33.407 --> 01:56:34.487
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to break things.

01:56:36.687 --> 01:56:38.368
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do another call when we get back from this break.

01:56:40.090 --> 01:56:45.554
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, oh, there's a song I really, really want to hear, but it's going to take me a minute to cue it up.

01:56:46.574 --> 01:56:48.296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need somebody to fill time, please.

01:56:52.779 --> 01:56:53.639
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how to fill time.

01:56:53.680 --> 01:56:56.081
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about something stupid.

01:56:56.121 --> 01:56:57.062
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

01:56:58.803 --> 01:56:59.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about, okay.

01:56:59.704 --> 01:56:59.784
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:57:02.788 --> 01:57:04.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry I asked.

01:57:04.969 --> 01:57:06.010
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never do that again.

01:57:06.170 --> 01:57:08.431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna fill time, okay?

01:57:08.812 --> 01:57:11.073
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the best filling time I can possibly do.

01:57:11.153 --> 01:57:12.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I gotta switch mics here.

01:57:12.334 --> 01:57:13.454
[SPEAKER_03]: I need one with a longer cord.

01:57:13.934 --> 01:57:14.655
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, just a sec.

01:57:15.776 --> 01:57:16.776
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.

01:57:19.117 --> 01:57:22.139
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just informed of an interesting fact.

01:57:22.800 --> 01:57:25.601
[SPEAKER_03]: This fact being, we have a peep left!

01:57:26.001 --> 01:57:27.342
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do we do with the peep?

01:57:27.923 --> 01:57:30.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, it goes in the microwave.

01:57:31.368 --> 01:57:31.969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:57:55.856 --> 01:57:58.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so one of the peeps is going to go in the microwave.

01:57:58.757 --> 01:58:07.560
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch that action on our camera at www.orangeloungeradio.com What the hell has this show come to?

01:58:12.662 --> 01:58:14.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, yay, I found the song I wanted to play.

01:58:14.923 --> 01:58:16.784
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can you see the microwave?

01:58:19.005 --> 01:58:20.185
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright.

01:58:20.592 --> 01:58:21.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do that during the break?

01:58:22.152 --> 01:58:23.093
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing that right now.

01:58:23.113 --> 01:58:23.953
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's doing it right now.

01:58:24.353 --> 01:58:25.613
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pushing the button.

01:58:25.633 --> 01:58:29.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.

01:58:29.714 --> 01:58:30.194
[SPEAKER_02]: No peep.

01:58:32.614 --> 01:58:34.295
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see inside the microwave.

01:58:34.335 --> 01:58:34.995
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all blurry.

01:58:36.495 --> 01:58:36.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you?

01:58:36.955 --> 01:58:38.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess it's the screenshot.

01:58:38.596 --> 01:58:38.956
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

01:58:38.976 --> 01:58:39.856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting big.

01:58:39.936 --> 01:58:41.036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

01:58:46.383 --> 01:58:47.084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting big.

01:58:47.184 --> 01:58:49.345
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes for wonderful radio.

01:58:49.445 --> 01:58:50.586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting really big.

01:58:51.786 --> 01:58:53.627
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, like, very deformed.

01:58:56.029 --> 01:58:57.210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're done.

01:58:59.491 --> 01:59:02.233
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never ask you people to fill time ever again.

01:59:02.293 --> 01:59:03.013
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God!

01:59:03.473 --> 01:59:04.854
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see on the webcam.

01:59:04.894 --> 01:59:07.996
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a big... It looks like our microwave has cancer.

01:59:08.056 --> 01:59:08.857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's horrible.

01:59:08.877 --> 01:59:09.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

01:59:10.638 --> 01:59:10.998
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:59:12.179 --> 01:59:12.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

01:59:12.579 --> 01:59:13.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to go to break.

01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:16.081
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, Nellie, we'll eat it.

01:59:17.362 --> 01:59:18.383
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

01:59:44.938 --> 01:59:46.240
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn the table!

01:59:46.801 --> 01:59:47.582
[SPEAKER_17]: You get it?

01:59:47.963 --> 01:59:49.705
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's practice!

01:59:50.947 --> 01:59:52.950
[SPEAKER_16]: First, hit the white keys!

02:00:19.454 --> 02:00:19.774
[SPEAKER_17]: Easy, huh?

02:00:19.814 --> 02:00:21.877
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's go on to the scratch day.

02:00:41.670 --> 02:00:45.551
[SPEAKER_17]: With the fast notes, the technique is to scratch fast.

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:48.752
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

02:00:48.832 --> 02:00:52.254
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard, but you can do it.

02:01:54.260 --> 02:01:55.281
[SPEAKER_17]: Remix Remix Remix

02:02:32.160 --> 02:02:32.666
[SPEAKER_14]: Remix

02:03:26.591 --> 02:03:31.453
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?

02:03:31.733 --> 02:03:40.076
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this time the chicken man, it wants your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him, oh Don't, what am I gonna do?

02:03:40.156 --> 02:03:41.357
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, what am I gonna do?

02:03:43.071 --> 02:03:46.514
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a cool game like this.

02:05:10.243 --> 02:05:13.507
[SPEAKER_12]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

02:05:14.068 --> 02:05:14.869
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

02:05:17.765 --> 02:05:19.465
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:19.505 --> 02:05:20.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoyed that break.

02:05:20.986 --> 02:05:23.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Emotion was the last song you heard before that.

02:05:23.686 --> 02:05:25.407
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear remix there.

02:05:26.107 --> 02:05:32.688
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting that set off was Instant Love, also known as the tutorial song from Beatmania, which, who doesn't love that song?

02:05:32.748 --> 02:05:33.908
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Konami is the man.

02:05:34.508 --> 02:05:35.069
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

02:05:36.229 --> 02:05:38.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so how did the microwave peep turn out in the end?

02:05:39.169 --> 02:05:41.770
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed the webcam was constantly being updated there during break.

02:05:41.810 --> 02:05:43.490
[SPEAKER_02]: I put some random things up on cam as well.

02:05:43.910 --> 02:05:44.430
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd that go?

02:05:44.751 --> 02:05:46.831
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned it into an OLR logo.

02:05:48.926 --> 02:05:50.267
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very strange.

02:05:51.448 --> 02:05:52.089
[SPEAKER_02]: All I have to say.

02:05:54.011 --> 02:05:58.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, www.orangeonstrater.com Oh my god, it does say OLR.

02:06:00.997 --> 02:06:02.899
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope somebody's saving pics tonight.

02:06:03.059 --> 02:06:03.880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

02:06:05.161 --> 02:06:08.284
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to open up the Skype line again real quick.

02:06:08.304 --> 02:06:09.405
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you guys a little window.

02:06:09.465 --> 02:06:10.666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody's trying to get in.

02:06:11.486 --> 02:06:13.108
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys do want to call in, say hello.

02:06:14.085 --> 02:06:17.047
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeonstrater.com Click on interact with us.

02:06:17.467 --> 02:06:20.449
[SPEAKER_02]: I notice a lot of our regular callers are not here tonight.

02:06:20.469 --> 02:06:22.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Zaku, he's nowhere to be seen tonight.

02:06:22.450 --> 02:06:23.531
[SPEAKER_02]: He's usually the first one in.

02:06:24.331 --> 02:06:25.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowhere to be seen tonight.

02:06:26.512 --> 02:06:30.935
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a noob and you want to talk to us, now's a good chance to get in.

02:06:32.210 --> 02:06:32.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronma S, Actdeft

02:06:50.987 --> 02:06:51.908
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty good.

02:06:51.928 --> 02:06:53.929
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another picture for you.

02:06:54.489 --> 02:06:57.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the, uh, the, um, uh, Altercade kicking.

02:06:57.872 --> 02:06:59.052
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

02:06:59.232 --> 02:07:01.254
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you post the link one more time in the chatroom?

02:07:01.294 --> 02:07:04.756
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get a chance to look at it because I was busy queuing up that particular break.

02:07:05.376 --> 02:07:06.417
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, no problem.

02:07:06.437 --> 02:07:07.658
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me scroll back up here.

02:07:10.085 --> 02:07:10.605
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

02:07:11.045 --> 02:07:12.126
[SPEAKER_02]: The wonders of the internet.

02:07:12.166 --> 02:07:14.946
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually hear the click, click, click, click.

02:07:15.306 --> 02:07:17.827
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're scrolling up there.

02:07:17.847 --> 02:07:18.187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

02:07:18.487 --> 02:07:20.328
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear Jamie cheering, so it must be a good picture.

02:07:20.868 --> 02:07:21.648
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's that one.

02:07:22.328 --> 02:07:24.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'd seen that one previously.

02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:25.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one you showed me on Thursday?

02:07:26.669 --> 02:07:27.690
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't you show me one on Thursday?

02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:28.210
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't remember.

02:07:28.230 --> 02:07:30.570
[SPEAKER_24]: I think those were ones from last week.

02:07:30.590 --> 02:07:31.471
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, last week.

02:07:33.051 --> 02:07:35.932
[SPEAKER_24]: And we went out... Are those the only two?

02:07:35.952 --> 02:07:37.192
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought you had a new one.

02:07:38.058 --> 02:07:38.579
[SPEAKER_24]: I do, I do.

02:07:38.599 --> 02:07:39.860
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm about to get the link to that right now.

02:07:39.900 --> 02:07:40.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

02:07:40.261 --> 02:07:40.921
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that one.

02:07:41.022 --> 02:07:41.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the new one.

02:07:42.844 --> 02:07:43.324
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

02:07:43.645 --> 02:07:44.406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, okay.

02:07:44.906 --> 02:07:45.227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

02:07:46.148 --> 02:07:46.808
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, it's big.

02:07:47.129 --> 02:07:48.290
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new picture.

02:07:49.031 --> 02:07:50.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd seen those two previous ones.

02:07:50.593 --> 02:07:53.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he's posting these in our chat room at www.wipontryo.com.

02:07:53.556 --> 02:07:54.498
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a monitor kick.

02:07:58.800 --> 02:07:59.620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

02:08:00.280 --> 02:08:03.361
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that guy behind you playing DDR?

02:08:04.041 --> 02:08:05.822
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a little story about that.

02:08:06.182 --> 02:08:11.784
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy behind you playing DDR looks like he is in a shower or something.

02:08:12.004 --> 02:08:14.304
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God, he's covered in sweat.

02:08:14.824 --> 02:08:16.245
[SPEAKER_24]: Doubles heavy.

02:08:16.525 --> 02:08:17.305
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sweaty man.

02:08:17.765 --> 02:08:18.365
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with that?

02:08:19.406 --> 02:08:20.406
[SPEAKER_24]: He was playing doubles heavy.

02:08:21.458 --> 02:08:24.661
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see two sets of arrows there.

02:08:24.701 --> 02:08:26.522
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing, but he's not playing it in the picture.

02:08:26.702 --> 02:08:26.962
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, no.

02:08:26.982 --> 02:08:27.302
[SPEAKER_24]: There it is.

02:08:47.165 --> 02:08:48.225
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the way to do it.

02:08:48.425 --> 02:08:55.628
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, remember that little kid we scared off from a golf line one time because he was making fun of us and didn't I challenge him to a duel or something and he ran away?

02:08:55.648 --> 02:09:07.131
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one time where I had these guys hanging around and they were talking all kinds of shit so I said, okay, I'll pay for you to play if you really think that it's that stupid, but I pick the song.

02:09:09.472 --> 02:09:09.972
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

02:09:11.303 --> 02:09:12.584
[SPEAKER_08]: I had them thrown out later that night.

02:09:14.366 --> 02:09:18.749
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you kicked the Ultra Kade machine, you had to go kick these guys a little bit.

02:09:19.530 --> 02:09:24.294
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, and for the first time in my life, I double A'd all four songs right in front of them.

02:09:25.274 --> 02:09:26.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very nice.

02:09:26.275 --> 02:09:30.338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those moments of pressure when you start doing really well at DDR, huh?

02:09:30.859 --> 02:09:31.219
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

02:09:31.339 --> 02:09:32.000
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

02:09:32.080 --> 02:09:33.061
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, my friend.

02:09:33.221 --> 02:09:33.481
Thanks.

02:09:34.122 --> 02:09:37.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and, um... And I noticed, I just want to point out the arcade area.

02:09:37.344 --> 02:09:42.467
[SPEAKER_02]: The Altercade machine is right next to the DDR machine, which I think is a very interesting setup there.

02:09:42.807 --> 02:09:45.108
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm sorry, your thought?

02:09:45.829 --> 02:09:50.691
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, um, if anyone hasn't gotten it yet, the PSP is coming out on Thursday.

02:09:51.032 --> 02:09:51.672
[SPEAKER_24]: Best Buy...

02:09:52.543 --> 02:09:54.945
[SPEAKER_24]: You can go right to Best Buy and pick it up at 8 o'clock in the morning.

02:09:54.965 --> 02:09:55.546
[SPEAKER_24]: No reserves.

02:09:55.686 --> 02:09:57.148
[SPEAKER_24]: First come, first serve.

02:09:57.328 --> 02:10:01.992
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a lazy bum and didn't pre-order it like myself, that's probably going to be your only option.

02:10:02.032 --> 02:10:04.635
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is exactly what I had to do with the DS, because I'm a lazy bum.

02:10:04.815 --> 02:10:10.380
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, to counter that, you could just pre-order it at GameStop, have somebody call you the day before and pick it up at your convenience.

02:10:11.481 --> 02:10:12.022
[SPEAKER_24]: Even better.

02:10:12.763 --> 02:10:13.083
[SPEAKER_24]: You could.

02:10:13.923 --> 02:10:37.189
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can have a fiance that works at GameStop and bring it home exactly and he could be all bitch bring it home because it's going to be or I ain't putting out I ain't putting out and my Final Fantasy XI Atlas I want to I totally want a Final Fantasy XI Atlas but then again I don't I quit that game I quit that game Rob I quit that game anyway any other thoughts Ranma before I let you go

02:10:38.880 --> 02:10:40.560
[SPEAKER_24]: One of my new friends is listening tonight.

02:10:40.620 --> 02:10:41.941
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say, hi, Liz.

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:42.601
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

[SPEAKER_24]: I love Britney Spears.

02:10:48.244 --> 02:10:48.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Carson.

02:10:49.264 --> 02:10:50.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay me some Britney Spears.

02:10:50.245 --> 02:10:52.125
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to Liz.

02:10:52.145 --> 02:10:52.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Liz.

02:10:53.346 --> 02:10:57.128
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to do my special impersonation just for your friend.

02:10:57.288 --> 02:10:57.608
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

02:11:00.789 --> 02:11:01.350
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

02:11:01.910 --> 02:11:02.650
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys rock.

02:11:03.130 --> 02:11:03.430
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:11:03.450 --> 02:11:03.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:11:04.031 --> 02:11:04.891
[SPEAKER_02]: You rock for calling.

02:11:04.931 --> 02:11:05.391
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

02:11:05.792 --> 02:11:06.092
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

02:11:06.292 --> 02:11:06.452
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

02:11:07.717 --> 02:11:09.559
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a ferret before I pick up the next call?

02:11:09.579 --> 02:11:10.680
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a ferret beep for Liz?

02:11:11.160 --> 02:11:12.361
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I've got to get to the next call.

02:11:13.662 --> 02:11:14.122
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quick.

02:11:15.183 --> 02:11:15.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, really quick.

02:11:16.004 --> 02:11:17.065
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm getting to this next call.

02:11:17.145 --> 02:11:17.806
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret for Liz.

02:11:19.867 --> 02:11:20.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

02:11:20.868 --> 02:11:21.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:11:21.549 --> 02:11:22.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hi.

02:11:22.189 --> 02:11:23.430
[SPEAKER_02]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:23.470 --> 02:11:23.831
[SPEAKER_02]: Who this?

02:11:24.731 --> 02:11:26.233
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

02:11:26.513 --> 02:11:27.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt.

02:11:27.914 --> 02:11:28.855
[SPEAKER_02]: What is on your mind, my friend?

02:11:29.575 --> 02:11:29.876
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing.

02:11:29.896 --> 02:11:36.021
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to say, I just want to apologize to DarkSakura about the little argument in the chat room earlier.

02:11:36.491 --> 02:11:36.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:11:37.051 --> 02:11:38.632
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, apology accepted, thank you.

02:11:39.053 --> 02:11:39.413
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

02:11:39.853 --> 02:11:42.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, aww, aww, I love moments.

02:11:42.695 --> 02:11:45.377
[SPEAKER_02]: I love moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:46.657 --> 02:11:49.899
[SPEAKER_19]: See, I'm nice, I'm nice, I'm not a bad guy.

02:11:50.220 --> 02:11:53.241
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody said you weren't a nice guy, it's just you might have some typing issues.

02:11:53.281 --> 02:11:54.222
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

02:11:55.243 --> 02:11:57.944
[SPEAKER_02]: I get criticized for my pronunciation.

02:11:57.964 --> 02:12:00.246
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't even pronounce pronunciation.

02:12:01.086 --> 02:12:04.909
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, when I was four, I glued my fingers together, so, you know.

02:12:05.149 --> 02:12:05.409
Okay.

02:12:06.952 --> 02:12:07.452
[SPEAKER_19]: It happens.

02:12:08.212 --> 02:12:08.733
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

02:12:08.933 --> 02:12:11.954
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on 2DX Nightstyle or any of the new stuff coming out?

02:12:13.314 --> 02:12:14.355
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really know what that is.

02:12:14.775 --> 02:12:15.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's alright.

02:12:15.655 --> 02:12:16.655
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove, you know that one?

02:12:17.376 --> 02:12:22.077
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, you know, my arcade kind of has it, except they don't, but you know.

02:12:22.537 --> 02:12:29.680
[SPEAKER_19]: They've had like the whole box and everything for it, but they still have DDR4th Mix.

02:12:30.800 --> 02:12:32.721
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove cabinet they have DDR4th Mix?

02:12:32.741 --> 02:12:32.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

02:12:33.214 --> 02:12:34.915
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they've had it in there for like about two weeks.

02:12:34.955 --> 02:12:36.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is ironic.

02:12:36.716 --> 02:12:42.420
[SPEAKER_02]: When you consider that In the Groove is kind of a stowaway game, and you always see In the Groove and DDR cabinets, that is great.

02:12:42.520 --> 02:12:43.641
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like an upgrade.

02:12:43.881 --> 02:12:46.303
[SPEAKER_08]: That's... It is an upgrade.

02:12:46.543 --> 02:12:47.524
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with you on that.

02:12:49.245 --> 02:12:49.545
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:12:50.046 --> 02:12:50.366
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

02:12:50.446 --> 02:12:51.286
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss 4th Mix.

02:12:51.607 --> 02:12:52.707
[SPEAKER_02]: 4th Mix was such a wonderful mix.

02:12:53.748 --> 02:12:55.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 4th Plus or 4th Mix?

02:12:56.330 --> 02:12:56.670
[SPEAKER_19]: 4th Plus.

02:12:57.070 --> 02:12:58.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Play some conga feeling for me.

02:12:59.412 --> 02:13:01.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't have 4th Plus here anymore.

02:13:02.194 --> 02:13:02.474
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

02:13:03.095 --> 02:13:03.855
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, no way.

02:13:04.356 --> 02:13:04.696
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.

02:13:05.236 --> 02:13:05.917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, try it.

02:13:05.937 --> 02:13:07.237
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, play some Rhythm and Police.

02:13:08.678 --> 02:13:09.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhythm and Police is cool.

02:13:09.759 --> 02:13:12.220
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any other thoughts, SSJ, before I let you go?

02:13:13.801 --> 02:13:19.224
[SPEAKER_19]: Not really, just a little excited about the anime convention in Arizona that's coming this week.

02:13:19.984 --> 02:13:20.405
[SPEAKER_02]: What city?

02:13:21.105 --> 02:13:21.405
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix.

02:13:22.206 --> 02:13:23.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix, all right, right on.

02:13:24.027 --> 02:13:24.747
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the name of it?

02:13:26.670 --> 02:13:28.271
[SPEAKER_19]: and Arizona, Anniezona.

02:13:28.592 --> 02:13:28.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:13:29.352 --> 02:13:31.394
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like Arizona, but Anniezona.

02:13:31.574 --> 02:13:31.955
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

02:13:31.995 --> 02:13:32.395
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

02:13:32.455 --> 02:13:32.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:13:33.256 --> 02:13:36.478
[SPEAKER_19]: And the guest of honor is Yoshitaka Mano.

02:13:36.999 --> 02:13:37.359
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:13:37.739 --> 02:13:38.580
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Arizona.

02:13:40.522 --> 02:13:40.982
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, y'all.

02:13:41.463 --> 02:13:41.983
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really?

02:13:42.544 --> 02:13:42.684
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

02:13:43.224 --> 02:13:43.805
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would.

02:13:43.965 --> 02:13:44.545
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

02:13:44.585 --> 02:13:45.266
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like my favorite artist.

02:13:45.346 --> 02:13:46.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Our webmaster lives in Arizona.

02:13:46.847 --> 02:13:48.228
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you he might be checking that out.

02:13:48.529 --> 02:13:51.431
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason has to go talk to my hero for me.

02:13:51.591 --> 02:13:53.773
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason's not listening tonight, which is kind of weird.

02:13:53.813 --> 02:13:54.373
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn him.

02:13:54.634 --> 02:13:54.854
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

02:13:56.267 --> 02:13:59.370
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to meet my artistic hero.

02:13:59.510 --> 02:14:00.491
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun at the convention.

02:14:00.531 --> 02:14:03.893
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had money, we would go too, but unfortunately we're poor.

02:14:03.913 --> 02:14:07.476
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I'll get an autograph for Sakura as a peace offering.

02:14:07.496 --> 02:14:09.377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so nice of you.

02:14:10.718 --> 02:14:12.880
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give you both a hug.

02:14:12.980 --> 02:14:14.922
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop provoking you.

02:14:15.782 --> 02:14:16.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

02:14:16.603 --> 02:14:17.344
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for calling in.

02:14:17.364 --> 02:14:18.484
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very big of you.

02:14:18.665 --> 02:14:20.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

02:14:20.126 --> 02:14:20.326
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

02:14:23.326 --> 02:14:27.029
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, I'm just feeling, I feel fuzzy wuzzy and I feel sick.

02:14:28.310 --> 02:14:28.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

02:14:28.990 --> 02:14:29.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

02:14:31.512 --> 02:14:32.312
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was fun.

02:14:36.235 --> 02:14:38.216
[SPEAKER_02]: A lovely Skype segment tonight.

02:14:38.496 --> 02:14:39.437
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't complain about that one.

02:14:40.846 --> 02:14:43.447
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go to a break, but then I realized we just had a break.

02:14:43.487 --> 02:14:44.127
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do that.

02:14:44.207 --> 02:14:47.488
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to take a break from breaks.

02:14:47.868 --> 02:14:50.808
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get into the FUs of the week is what we need to do, dammit.

02:14:50.888 --> 02:14:52.489
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not angry anymore!

02:14:52.649 --> 02:14:54.289
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is exactly why we need to do it now.

02:15:00.211 --> 02:15:01.871
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, something did piss me off a lot today.

02:15:02.267 --> 02:15:04.149
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, why do we do this every single week?

02:15:35.408 --> 02:15:36.449
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is bad.

02:15:37.229 --> 02:15:38.890
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is justice.

02:15:38.970 --> 02:15:41.111
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is punishment.

02:15:41.171 --> 02:15:43.932
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is... This is fucked up.

02:15:44.892 --> 02:15:49.334
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to, uh... Okay, I have to explain this.

02:15:49.414 --> 02:15:53.696
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows that I have this thing about old people who drive really, really slow.

02:15:54.356 --> 02:15:57.138
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have this thing about people who talk on their cell phones while they drive.

02:15:58.038 --> 02:16:00.019
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the ultimate in piss off today.

02:16:00.619 --> 02:16:04.541
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was stuck behind this old guy talking on his cell phone.

02:16:06.219 --> 02:16:13.041
[SPEAKER_08]: He was all veiny and ancient and was leaning over the steering wheel, you know that type?

02:16:13.841 --> 02:16:15.742
[SPEAKER_08]: And then talking on his damn cell phone.

02:16:16.002 --> 02:16:17.382
[SPEAKER_18]: Veiny and ancient.

02:16:18.523 --> 02:16:22.524
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean, when people get really old that you can feel their veins.

02:16:25.465 --> 02:16:26.925
[SPEAKER_08]: His wife was in the car with him.

02:16:28.946 --> 02:16:30.566
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't look like they were having a hard time.

02:16:31.317 --> 02:16:32.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone was having a heart attack.

02:16:33.099 --> 02:16:35.781
[SPEAKER_08]: Billy, how did you get trapped in the phone?

02:16:37.242 --> 02:16:40.905
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just passed him and cut him off and that was good.

02:16:41.245 --> 02:16:42.566
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that make you feel better?

02:16:42.586 --> 02:16:43.267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it did.

02:16:43.287 --> 02:16:45.729
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really cut him off, but yeah.

02:16:45.909 --> 02:16:56.498
[SPEAKER_08]: Another FU goes toward our lovely president, fucking asshole, for bringing Senate to vote about that lady in Florida.

02:16:58.288 --> 02:17:05.254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is a lady who had been brain dead for 15 years, getting no oxygen to her brain.

02:17:05.634 --> 02:17:06.655
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a vegetable.

02:17:06.695 --> 02:17:07.755
[SPEAKER_08]: She still is a vegetable.

02:17:07.816 --> 02:17:10.898
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be anything but a living vegetable.

02:17:11.518 --> 02:17:14.301
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they got authorization to take the feeding tube out finally.

02:17:14.841 --> 02:17:23.568
[SPEAKER_08]: And Senate is, you know, they have other things they could be voting on, like, you know, allotting more money toward, you know, useful things.

02:17:24.526 --> 02:17:28.669
[SPEAKER_08]: or, you know, improvement of our social systems.

02:17:29.090 --> 02:17:35.514
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, they're voting on whether or not to let basically a corpse on life support actually be a real corpse.

02:17:36.915 --> 02:17:43.420
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, you know, they're costing this family all of these doctor bills just because of this whole right to die issue.

02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:44.821
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not there anymore.

02:17:44.961 --> 02:17:46.142
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, no one home.

02:17:46.622 --> 02:17:47.243
[SPEAKER_08]: Let her go.

02:17:48.324 --> 02:17:51.066
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Jamie, we can rebuild them.

02:17:51.666 --> 02:17:52.867
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the technology.

02:17:54.255 --> 02:17:56.456
[SPEAKER_02]: We could put Walt Disney's brain in there.

02:17:56.576 --> 02:17:56.677
[SPEAKER_02]: E.T.

02:17:56.697 --> 02:17:57.757
[SPEAKER_08]: phoned home already.

02:17:58.698 --> 02:18:06.683
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're left with is to... Actually, she's probably more intelligent than him right now, but... I say... You know what?

02:18:06.803 --> 02:18:08.464
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we elect this lady president.

02:18:09.004 --> 02:18:09.584
[SPEAKER_09]: She'd do a better job.

02:18:09.604 --> 02:18:10.725
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm scared about?

02:18:10.805 --> 02:18:12.846
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we have living dead.

02:18:12.866 --> 02:18:15.108
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.

02:18:15.188 --> 02:18:16.228
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop cultivating zombies.

02:18:16.268 --> 02:18:17.769
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know she's going to get out of the bed.

02:18:18.150 --> 02:18:19.670
[SPEAKER_03]: Brains.

02:18:20.151 --> 02:18:20.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Brains.

02:18:20.931 --> 02:18:21.772
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be brain dead.

02:18:21.832 --> 02:18:23.032
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs brains.

02:18:23.473 --> 02:18:23.653
[SPEAKER_06]: With...

02:18:24.281 --> 02:18:31.284
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, you see... This woman is starving to death for 14 days, and you're like, BRAIN!

02:18:31.364 --> 02:18:33.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Let you guys starve to death!

02:18:33.145 --> 02:18:36.087
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's what we need, a brain-dead person starving for brains!

02:18:36.487 --> 02:18:39.708
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my F you, so fuck you, shut up!

02:18:40.489 --> 02:18:42.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

02:18:42.690 --> 02:18:45.991
[SPEAKER_08]: She does not know that she's starving.

02:18:46.131 --> 02:18:49.473
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't have the capacity to register pain.

02:18:52.768 --> 02:18:57.451
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's going to be one of those...

02:19:17.719 --> 02:19:19.200
[SPEAKER_25]: Lethal Injection.

02:19:20.340 --> 02:19:20.800
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay?

02:19:21.060 --> 02:19:23.441
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're going to kill her, do it quickly.

02:19:23.742 --> 02:19:29.424
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't leave her to wither and starve and die away slowly.

02:19:32.926 --> 02:19:43.310
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly, I would prefer Lethal Injection, but if they have to do anything, you know, the only legal recourse they have is to take the tube out and let her die of natural causes.

02:19:44.113 --> 02:19:44.453
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

02:20:14.514 --> 02:20:17.096
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no mind or soul left in her body.

02:20:17.476 --> 02:20:18.417
[SPEAKER_08]: It has departed.

02:20:20.839 --> 02:20:21.339
[SPEAKER_08]: It's back.

02:20:21.399 --> 02:20:22.060
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing there.

02:20:22.140 --> 02:20:26.964
[SPEAKER_08]: She cannot maintain the cognitive functions of the average human being.

02:20:27.004 --> 02:20:27.644
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put it that way.

02:20:27.664 --> 02:20:29.546
[SPEAKER_08]: She has no cognitive functions.

02:20:30.867 --> 02:20:31.367
[SPEAKER_08]: End of story.

02:20:32.288 --> 02:20:36.131
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, I would say that if they could just go ahead and kill her.

02:20:37.941 --> 02:20:41.206
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say if they could legally get away with just injecting her and killing her, do it.

02:20:41.466 --> 02:20:44.291
[SPEAKER_08]: I would encourage somebody to go sneak into that hospital and do it.

02:20:44.391 --> 02:20:44.871
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

02:20:46.346 --> 02:20:50.347
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be one of those ironic things where they're going to have this whole battle.

02:20:50.387 --> 02:20:53.749
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that movie, what is it, Citizen Ruth?

02:20:53.849 --> 02:20:54.649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like that movie.

02:20:54.709 --> 02:20:55.669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big abortion.

02:20:55.929 --> 02:20:57.770
[SPEAKER_02]: Should she or should she not have an abortion?

02:20:58.050 --> 02:20:59.511
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, she miscarries.

02:20:59.931 --> 02:21:03.532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be one of those types of things where she's going to end up... She's going to wake up.

02:21:03.712 --> 02:21:08.093
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to roll and fall out of her bed and kill herself that way or something.

02:21:08.394 --> 02:21:10.294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be one of those really tragic things.

02:21:10.334 --> 02:21:12.815
[SPEAKER_02]: After this big, huge fight, something else will happen.

02:21:13.735 --> 02:21:14.556
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my prediction.

02:21:14.576 --> 02:21:15.176
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

02:21:15.236 --> 02:21:15.636
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate...

02:21:17.066 --> 02:21:26.711
[SPEAKER_08]: One way or another, her husband should not be made to suffer watching this joke of his wife be kept on life support.

02:21:27.031 --> 02:21:27.951
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason for it.

02:21:29.412 --> 02:21:31.213
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel really bad for him.

02:21:31.473 --> 02:21:34.455
[SPEAKER_08]: And then her family, her parents are holding on to false hopes.

02:21:34.475 --> 02:21:37.136
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not waking up.

02:21:37.236 --> 02:21:39.177
[SPEAKER_08]: If they truly loved her, they would let her go.

02:21:42.426 --> 02:21:43.627
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree with that.

02:21:44.888 --> 02:21:47.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's end on an agreement, please.

02:21:48.370 --> 02:21:49.951
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs to die one way or another.

02:21:49.971 --> 02:21:51.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, let's end on an agreement.

02:21:51.733 --> 02:21:54.775
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs to be killed.

02:21:54.855 --> 02:21:56.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other FUs, Jamie?

02:21:56.076 --> 02:21:56.556
[SPEAKER_08]: Break her neck.

02:21:59.478 --> 02:22:00.939
[SPEAKER_08]: What rules does this have?

02:22:02.920 --> 02:22:04.442
[SPEAKER_08]: I say we give her the log treatment.

02:22:04.842 --> 02:22:05.482
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's bad.

02:22:06.243 --> 02:22:06.943
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

02:22:07.304 --> 02:22:08.785
[SPEAKER_08]: My other FUs, I really don't have any.

02:22:09.745 --> 02:22:11.567
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just really been sort of my inferiority.

02:22:11.667 --> 02:22:12.047
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

02:22:12.742 --> 02:22:14.483
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, fuck you to the worm in Silent Hill 3.

02:22:14.723 --> 02:22:16.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

02:22:17.085 --> 02:22:17.405
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm done.

02:22:17.945 --> 02:22:18.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:22:18.426 --> 02:22:21.468
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, afterthought, revive Jeffrey Dahmer, have him go at it.

02:22:21.808 --> 02:22:23.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you guys are weird.

02:22:23.629 --> 02:22:24.410
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's go.

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:27.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's go to Loki.

02:22:29.733 --> 02:22:33.596
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't acknowledge that with a comment on air, please, I beg you.

02:22:33.676 --> 02:22:36.117
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this, where is this at?

02:22:36.137 --> 02:22:37.238
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Florida, right?

02:22:38.683 --> 02:22:39.043
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

02:22:57.393 --> 02:23:02.075
[SPEAKER_02]: 100,000 people died in a tsunami in January, and we are all hung up on this chick.

02:23:02.155 --> 02:23:05.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but did any of them turn into zombies?

02:23:05.536 --> 02:23:06.416
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

02:23:06.496 --> 02:23:07.256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:23:07.917 --> 02:23:15.739
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, at any rate, you know, the body, true, it can live without cognitive function, but that doesn't necessarily constitute life.

02:23:17.680 --> 02:23:18.500
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's going to happen?

02:23:18.520 --> 02:23:19.920
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to pull out that goddamn tube.

02:23:19.960 --> 02:23:21.681
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to go, breathe!

02:23:21.941 --> 02:23:22.941
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts there.

02:23:23.241 --> 02:23:25.622
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously cannot take this topic anymore, please.

02:23:26.935 --> 02:23:31.018
[SPEAKER_08]: The simple point behind it is just that the Republicans are trying to one-up the Democrats.

02:23:31.038 --> 02:23:31.518
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

02:23:31.538 --> 02:23:33.440
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

02:23:34.861 --> 02:23:35.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

02:23:36.002 --> 02:23:36.322
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

02:23:37.472 --> 02:23:39.633
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my solution to the whole problem.

02:23:39.954 --> 02:23:44.736
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have America, because America can make great decisions like choosing the American Idol.

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.137
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have them vote on how she dies.

02:23:47.577 --> 02:23:55.201
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this can be anywhere from being shot out of a cannon to dropped from a plane, space shuttle, mirror, I mean, it doesn't really matter.

02:23:55.301 --> 02:23:57.002
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, have her die.

02:23:57.042 --> 02:23:58.263
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she can't feel pain.

02:23:58.523 --> 02:24:00.624
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, might as well contribute to society.

02:24:00.904 --> 02:24:01.544
[SPEAKER_03]: She cannot.

02:24:01.564 --> 02:24:02.325
[SPEAKER_03]: She's brain dead.

02:24:04.170 --> 02:24:05.430
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll put it this way.

02:24:05.490 --> 02:24:13.153
[SPEAKER_08]: Her nervous system can register a pain response, but her brain does not understand that she is in pain because there's nothing there.

02:24:14.373 --> 02:24:18.395
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we poke her and then she goes, ow, then we'll know that she can feel pain.

02:24:19.155 --> 02:24:20.795
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tough, then she's not feeling pain.

02:24:20.815 --> 02:24:21.476
[SPEAKER_18]: She's not there.

02:24:22.596 --> 02:24:24.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's enough of that.

02:24:25.237 --> 02:24:28.338
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have a heart attack and then we're going to have to decide how we should kill ourselves.

02:24:29.232 --> 02:24:30.313
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's already dead.

02:24:30.433 --> 02:24:31.374
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a zombie.

02:24:31.814 --> 02:24:37.639
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, I promise you, if ever you've had some life support with a tube in your stomach, we'll let you go.

02:24:37.659 --> 02:24:39.100
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull that fucking tube out.

02:24:39.320 --> 02:24:41.002
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be a vegetable.

02:24:41.462 --> 02:24:42.703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you pull out.

02:24:42.783 --> 02:24:43.784
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I already said this.

02:24:44.577 --> 02:24:45.377
[SPEAKER_02]: I decree this.

02:24:45.457 --> 02:24:53.120
[SPEAKER_02]: If I am in that state, I want you to fling... I want to be put in a catapult, and I want to be flung against a glass building.

02:24:53.220 --> 02:24:54.121
[SPEAKER_09]: Flung at the White House.

02:24:54.601 --> 02:24:56.422
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I want to be flung at a glass building.

02:24:56.802 --> 02:24:58.543
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be flung at the Apple building.

02:24:58.843 --> 02:24:59.103
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool.

02:24:59.123 --> 02:24:59.903
[SPEAKER_02]: During lunch hour.

02:25:00.443 --> 02:25:01.324
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be rad.

02:25:01.404 --> 02:25:02.384
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my request.

02:25:02.444 --> 02:25:02.804
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:25:02.904 --> 02:25:07.326
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we dress you up in all matching clothes so that you can match your iPod or...

02:25:08.889 --> 02:25:16.415
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing that I do want to mention is that she had actually been witnessing that she would never want to be maintained on life support.

02:25:18.877 --> 02:25:19.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

02:25:19.618 --> 02:25:22.800
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Loki, that comment, oh my god.

02:25:24.301 --> 02:25:25.122
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on this show.

02:25:26.343 --> 02:25:28.085
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still don't get hate mail.

02:25:28.385 --> 02:25:29.466
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the amazing thing.

02:25:29.506 --> 02:25:31.307
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get hate mail over comments like that.

02:25:31.528 --> 02:25:32.648
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the voice of the people.

02:25:32.869 --> 02:25:33.589
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

02:25:35.131 --> 02:25:35.591
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

02:25:36.075 --> 02:25:42.498
[SPEAKER_03]: So, further FUs of the week, go to bad drivers, especially people that don't know how to drive in rain.

02:25:42.919 --> 02:25:47.281
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when the raindrops are big and there's pea-sized hail coming down, what do you do?

02:25:47.321 --> 02:25:48.722
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to drive faster, that's right.

02:25:49.162 --> 02:25:54.725
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can slip on the, you know, the water and stuff and hydroplane off a cliff or something.

02:25:55.085 --> 02:25:59.127
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what people do, and that's what people did today, except they didn't fall off a cliff.

02:26:00.528 --> 02:26:02.349
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, they just got in a car accident and

02:26:03.857 --> 02:26:06.477
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe you turn over a median and stuff like that.

02:26:07.018 --> 02:26:07.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, people.

02:26:09.438 --> 02:26:18.520
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, um, fuck you to, uh, to Necrophiliacs.

02:26:19.620 --> 02:26:21.800
[SPEAKER_03]: Please move past it.

02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:23.400
[SPEAKER_03]: Please move past it.

02:26:23.581 --> 02:26:24.841
[SPEAKER_03]: Even dead people need lovin'.

02:26:25.181 --> 02:26:30.962
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, uh, um, no, really though, um, am I really here?

02:26:31.222 --> 02:26:31.942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think

02:26:32.421 --> 02:26:33.422
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably done.

02:26:33.902 --> 02:26:39.246
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know the only thing that... I think she should run for governor.

02:26:41.747 --> 02:26:42.388
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a chance.

02:26:45.750 --> 02:26:48.111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done, I think.

02:26:48.952 --> 02:26:50.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of anything else funny.

02:26:50.693 --> 02:26:51.033
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

02:26:52.875 --> 02:26:54.916
You're done.

02:26:57.197 --> 02:26:57.558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:26:57.898 --> 02:27:00.820
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some good FUs of the week, but I lost it.

02:27:01.020 --> 02:27:01.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

02:27:02.754 --> 02:27:03.935
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to disagreements.

02:27:04.015 --> 02:27:05.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we all just get along?

02:27:05.256 --> 02:27:06.156
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a hug, you guys?

02:27:06.456 --> 02:27:07.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a big group hug.

02:27:08.137 --> 02:27:08.918
[SPEAKER_02]: Big group hug.

02:27:09.498 --> 02:27:09.978
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:13.781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me and Angel in the hug.

02:27:13.941 --> 02:27:14.941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not feeling the hug.

02:27:15.442 --> 02:27:16.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the hug, everybody?

02:27:17.483 --> 02:27:18.263
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys suck.

02:27:18.844 --> 02:27:20.505
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to you guys for not wanting to do a hug.

02:27:22.146 --> 02:27:22.586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

02:27:23.587 --> 02:27:25.108
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything good to say.

02:27:25.348 --> 02:27:26.228
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what we could do.

02:27:26.368 --> 02:27:26.648
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

02:27:27.289 --> 02:27:30.611
[SPEAKER_03]: We can dress her up and put her in funny situations like Bernie.

02:27:31.306 --> 02:27:36.210
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be like, you know, Weekend with... Weekend with... Terry.

02:27:36.370 --> 02:27:37.091
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Terry.

02:27:37.271 --> 02:27:37.631
[SPEAKER_03]: Terry?

02:27:38.031 --> 02:27:39.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Weekend with Terry.

02:27:39.433 --> 02:27:41.794
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Weekend at Terry's or something like that.

02:27:41.854 --> 02:27:47.959
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where she's just sitting there... You are... There is a special place in hell.

02:27:48.279 --> 02:27:50.321
[SPEAKER_02]: They already have your name engraved on the seat.

02:27:53.243 --> 02:27:53.984
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a seat?

02:27:54.284 --> 02:27:55.005
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

02:27:55.760 --> 02:27:56.261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

02:27:56.721 --> 02:27:58.903
[SPEAKER_02]: We seriously need to get through this segment.

02:27:59.243 --> 02:28:01.205
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other folks in the room.

02:28:03.747 --> 02:28:05.389
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, your FUs of the week.

02:28:07.671 --> 02:28:09.732
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, where to start on my FUs?

02:28:10.033 --> 02:28:10.353
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wait.

02:28:10.373 --> 02:28:11.654
[SPEAKER_25]: I wasn't supposed to bring that up.

02:28:14.276 --> 02:28:18.600
[SPEAKER_25]: FU to rude callers, especially at my workplace.

02:28:19.061 --> 02:28:19.861
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm here to help.

02:28:20.542 --> 02:28:21.683
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not here to be berated.

02:28:22.079 --> 02:28:25.381
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not here to, hmm, have death threats directed against me.

02:28:25.681 --> 02:28:26.062
[SPEAKER_25]: Get this.

02:28:26.462 --> 02:28:33.467
[SPEAKER_25]: One fucker decided to actually call in a bomb threat because of Bush's medical policies.

02:28:34.067 --> 02:28:35.408
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I work in healthcare.

02:28:36.589 --> 02:28:37.189
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell?

02:28:37.770 --> 02:28:39.431
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't leave that kind of shit on my voicemail.

02:28:39.451 --> 02:28:40.011
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you.

02:28:42.413 --> 02:28:46.616
[SPEAKER_25]: Tech support worker is more of my bargain for, but hey, whatever.

02:28:47.897 --> 02:28:48.777
[SPEAKER_25]: Ugh, let's see.

02:28:49.438 --> 02:28:51.239
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to stupid drivers in the rain.

02:28:53.234 --> 02:28:55.015
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I double F you from that.

02:28:55.955 --> 02:28:59.217
[SPEAKER_25]: Judging from the amount of cursing from my dad, I think he shares that F you too.

02:29:01.057 --> 02:29:01.618
[SPEAKER_25]: That's about it.

02:29:04.019 --> 02:29:04.359
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

02:29:06.019 --> 02:29:06.279
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

02:29:07.600 --> 02:29:15.483
[SPEAKER_10]: The F you to finals, because I had one operating system after another, because it was like back-to-back finals, and I was like, ah, brain fried, oh my god.

02:29:16.424 --> 02:29:17.904
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's over, so whatever.

02:29:18.824 --> 02:29:19.005
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

02:29:22.576 --> 02:29:24.438
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I don't know.

02:29:25.159 --> 02:29:27.060
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, yeah, I don't know.

02:29:27.641 --> 02:29:29.823
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to say after YouTube.

02:29:30.003 --> 02:29:31.124
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

02:29:31.184 --> 02:29:34.867
[SPEAKER_10]: After YouTube, I'm not playing DDR that much, because last night hurt.

02:29:35.127 --> 02:29:35.267
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

02:29:39.251 --> 02:29:46.017
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, yeah, that just means that I need to go to the arcade, like, once a week.

02:29:46.898 --> 02:29:47.298
[SPEAKER_10]: If, uh,

02:29:47.819 --> 02:29:49.901
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other people in this room would like to do that.

02:29:50.121 --> 02:29:51.422
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, that's it.

02:29:51.522 --> 02:29:51.862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

02:29:52.062 --> 02:29:52.303
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

02:29:53.323 --> 02:29:57.587
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a hint with a capital H. I'm just messing with you.

02:29:58.067 --> 02:29:58.407
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:29:59.809 --> 02:30:01.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chatroom FUs.

02:30:05.393 --> 02:30:06.874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with DarkTetsuya.

02:30:07.415 --> 02:30:10.337
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to you guys going to CCL and not telling me.

02:30:10.417 --> 02:30:10.897
[SPEAKER_02]: Grr.

02:30:12.419 --> 02:30:14.400
[SPEAKER_02]: I will send you a private message later, DarkTetsuya.

02:30:14.440 --> 02:30:15.261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're planning on going back.

02:30:16.593 --> 02:30:23.576
[SPEAKER_02]: VGM says F you to GameStop and EB Games for not having metal dance pads in Florida.

02:30:24.397 --> 02:30:26.017
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to me for being a noob.

02:30:30.119 --> 02:30:37.122
[SPEAKER_02]: Dork says F you to my friend who constantly plays the Ding Dong song for so much that I now made it as a ringtone.

02:30:37.602 --> 02:30:40.784
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I randomly say, oh, you've touched my tra-la-la.

02:30:43.593 --> 02:30:51.620
[SPEAKER_02]: AsianBuddy Paul says, F you to wisdom teeth removal, although my consolation is the pain meds that come with them.

02:30:51.800 --> 02:31:00.988
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to that website for firing slash banning me.

02:31:01.088 --> 02:31:01.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you hard.

02:31:01.908 --> 02:31:03.970
[SPEAKER_02]: For everything I did, this is the thanks I get.

02:31:04.210 --> 02:31:04.971
[SPEAKER_02]: F you royally.

02:31:06.937 --> 02:31:10.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says, F you to suddenly being sick out of nowhere.

02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:12.602
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the alleged song list for Donkey Konga 2.

02:31:13.342 --> 02:31:16.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Story of the Year, Good Charlotte, and Taking Back Sunday.

02:31:16.705 --> 02:31:19.828
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to make the Donkey Konga players of America retarded?

02:31:20.689 --> 02:31:23.991
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to this weekend being absolutely boring, being too sick to go anywhere.

02:31:24.332 --> 02:31:27.014
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning I had to stay at home, sit around, and be completely bored.

02:31:29.696 --> 02:31:33.980
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to my bad grammar and typing.

02:31:34.040 --> 02:31:35.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry again, Sakura.

02:31:36.505 --> 02:31:44.849
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the sunburn that I got on my face while watching a spring training baseball game thanks to my sunglasses.

02:31:44.889 --> 02:31:45.989
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like a raccoon now.

02:31:48.210 --> 02:31:56.773
[SPEAKER_02]: LemonLimeJump says FU to all the tourists in Fort Myers that make the city swell up like a horrible infection just because Edison lived here in the winter eons ago.

02:31:57.174 --> 02:31:57.694
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

02:31:57.914 --> 02:32:00.215
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to there being no DDR machines in Fort Myers.

02:32:01.488 --> 02:32:05.009
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, MPQ says, F you to being mistaken for 18.

02:32:05.629 --> 02:32:06.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't do me any good.

02:32:06.910 --> 02:32:07.810
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to do this?

02:32:07.930 --> 02:32:08.490
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you're not 18?

02:32:09.011 --> 02:32:09.551
[SPEAKER_02]: Go away.

02:32:10.231 --> 02:32:16.133
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to myself for crashing into a pole on my bike Thursday and getting a concussion and completely ruining my good day.

02:32:16.533 --> 02:32:16.953
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

02:32:17.514 --> 02:32:18.494
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to celebrities.

02:32:18.874 --> 02:32:20.274
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about the latest affair.

02:32:20.575 --> 02:32:22.115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who's fat or anorexic.

02:32:22.215 --> 02:32:23.676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who's married or divorced.

02:32:24.056 --> 02:32:25.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Just shut up already.

02:32:26.357 --> 02:32:27.057
[SPEAKER_25]: I hear you ain't 18, bitch.

02:32:29.130 --> 02:32:29.570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

02:32:30.090 --> 02:32:32.111
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all of our FUs that we got anyway.

02:32:33.531 --> 02:32:36.592
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for the FUs of the week.

02:32:36.612 --> 02:32:39.472
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for being angsty, I suppose.

02:32:39.852 --> 02:32:43.053
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of one late FU I would like to say.

02:32:43.613 --> 02:32:47.314
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to Spring Break Shark Attack for being on tonight on CBS.

02:32:47.514 --> 02:32:51.274
[SPEAKER_02]: All these sorority girls getting eaten by sharks live on CBS.

02:32:52.074 --> 02:32:52.935
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a TiVo.

02:32:54.295 --> 02:32:54.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's not on.

02:32:56.488 --> 02:32:56.968
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome!

02:32:57.008 --> 02:32:57.549
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

02:32:57.789 --> 02:32:58.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

02:33:05.092 --> 02:33:06.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the sharks will... Never mind.

02:33:07.233 --> 02:33:08.033
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even bring it up.

02:33:08.093 --> 02:33:08.814
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even bring it up.

02:33:09.494 --> 02:33:11.135
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they eat... Not going there.

02:33:11.235 --> 02:33:11.835
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

02:33:17.179 --> 02:33:24.205
[SPEAKER_03]: We could tie her to David Hasselhoff and make it seem like she's running because he'll be behind.

02:33:24.445 --> 02:33:26.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like a ventriloquist doll.

02:33:29.490 --> 02:33:34.834
[SPEAKER_03]: They could tie her to bars and stuff so they could have someone do a tap dance and she does a tap dance.

02:33:34.854 --> 02:33:34.935
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

02:33:38.826 --> 02:33:39.987
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we need to go to a break.

02:33:40.668 --> 02:33:41.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

02:33:42.149 --> 02:33:48.255
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, I want to show some keyboard mania love in this break, because I want to hear some keyboard mania songs.

02:33:49.201 --> 02:33:53.302
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, we'll do Ask Orange Lounge.

02:33:53.322 --> 02:33:53.882
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

02:33:54.362 --> 02:33:55.983
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:33:56.103 --> 02:33:56.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get into that.

02:33:56.803 --> 02:33:58.903
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can start submitting your questions for Ask Orange Lounge as well.

02:33:59.804 --> 02:34:00.964
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this.

02:34:01.224 --> 02:34:02.784
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some potpourri.

02:34:02.804 --> 02:34:04.365
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a mix of music in this break.

02:34:04.505 --> 02:34:06.865
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really want to play a Mambo A Go-Go song too.

02:34:07.426 --> 02:34:11.787
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this, starting off with some Klunkang.

02:34:11.847 --> 02:34:12.687
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

02:37:26.576 --> 02:37:27.559
Thanks for watching!

02:40:16.236 --> 02:40:21.997
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Boys.

02:40:23.318 --> 02:40:26.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, and we're back, boys and girls.

02:40:26.638 --> 02:40:31.259
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, you can send in your questions right now for Ask Orange Lounge because we're going to be getting to that shortly.

02:40:31.439 --> 02:40:34.420
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always want to hear the questions that you have.

02:40:34.440 --> 02:40:40.701
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to ask us about Bimani, you want to ask us about Ditter or 2DX or whatever, Keyboard Mania.

02:40:40.841 --> 02:40:43.422
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I used to be pretty good at Keyboard Mania, little known fact.

02:40:43.462 --> 02:40:44.382
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be pretty good at it.

02:40:44.946 --> 02:40:45.928
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:41:01.161 --> 02:41:01.602
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

02:41:20.862 --> 02:41:22.463
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Freak, Post of the Week

02:41:50.917 --> 02:41:51.397
DDR Freak Radio

02:42:18.999 --> 02:42:38.012
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it is so damn big, it gets not only all the cool people like you and me and, you know, the rest of the folks here in studio, but it gets the real weirdos, and it gets the noobs, the noobs, then the trolls, and it always gets an interesting post.

02:42:38.052 --> 02:42:47.778
[SPEAKER_02]: So this actually was nominated by one of our listeners, Flair One, sent me a private message and said, dude, DDR Freak Post of the Week right here, and I said, dude,

02:42:48.476 --> 02:42:48.896
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

02:42:49.197 --> 02:42:49.797
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is.

02:42:51.519 --> 02:42:57.484
[SPEAKER_02]: This post is titled, Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?

02:43:00.006 --> 02:43:01.007
[SPEAKER_02]: Here goes the message.

02:43:02.409 --> 02:43:05.211
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?

02:43:05.752 --> 02:43:08.174
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like not cheating like on the controller.

02:43:08.434 --> 02:43:08.935
[SPEAKER_02]: Spelled wrong.

02:43:09.195 --> 02:43:10.096
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, is it?

02:43:10.816 --> 02:43:13.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to attempt it tonight.

02:43:14.580 --> 02:43:16.601
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going over someone's house.

02:43:17.161 --> 02:43:19.402
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope their BF don't get mad.

02:43:20.162 --> 02:43:23.103
[SPEAKER_02]: And then wink icon, smile icon, grin icon.

02:43:23.603 --> 02:43:25.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, what else?

02:43:25.564 --> 02:43:26.284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people.

02:43:26.765 --> 02:43:29.846
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone get a AAA on Legend of Max?

02:43:31.886 --> 02:43:34.487
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is our DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:43:35.288 --> 02:43:37.308
[SPEAKER_25]: Technically, yes it is possible.

02:43:37.789 --> 02:43:41.290
[SPEAKER_25]: If it's sex and it's DDR, chances are Loki knows about it.

02:43:42.072 --> 02:43:47.455
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be possible, and this is the only way how, because it would be very difficult to have sex on DDR.

02:43:47.855 --> 02:43:53.519
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to probably be playing Disney Mix, and you'd have to play Mickey Mouse March, because it's all left and right arrows.

02:43:54.099 --> 02:44:02.824
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as long as someone is on a countertop that's placed right next to the pad, you could probably be able to step the left and right arrows while thrusting into them.

02:44:03.522 --> 02:44:04.583
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be the only way.

02:44:05.323 --> 02:44:06.504
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's impossible.

02:44:07.184 --> 02:44:12.248
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you understand the joke about this segment, but you're not actually supposed to reply to these posts.

02:44:14.289 --> 02:44:23.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Might I say, the post, just as a footnote, the post was promptly locked in the next post by everyone's favorite admin, Spike.

02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:31.015
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going over to someone's house and try to get them to cheat on their boyfriend with you by having sex while playing DDR.

02:44:31.075 --> 02:44:32.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Jesus, what's happening to kids these days.

02:44:33.077 --> 02:44:33.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Locke?

02:44:35.439 --> 02:44:37.000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying it's possible.

02:44:37.020 --> 02:44:40.443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that anyone should try it because that's retarded.

02:44:42.364 --> 02:44:43.385
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you had a thought.

02:44:45.427 --> 02:44:48.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hit the pause button, get it done with, then go back and play.

02:44:48.189 --> 02:44:53.293
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

02:44:58.332 --> 02:44:59.372
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love DDR Freak.

02:45:00.573 --> 02:45:02.033
[SPEAKER_02]: What would we do without DDR Freak?

02:45:06.695 --> 02:45:09.176
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad the microphone didn't pick up your little comment.

02:45:11.977 --> 02:45:13.398
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Magus.

02:45:15.479 --> 02:45:15.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

02:45:15.899 --> 02:45:16.499
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

02:45:23.635 --> 02:45:26.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:45:27.076 --> 02:45:30.276
[SPEAKER_02]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:45:30.776 --> 02:45:34.017
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some noobs tonight who are asking some questions.

02:45:34.537 --> 02:45:37.957
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope they're not as bad as the post on DDR Freak.

02:45:40.078 --> 02:45:44.259
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does Orange Lounge have more than, like, why does Orange have like a few syllables in there?

02:45:46.959 --> 02:45:50.180
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to have sex while listening to Orange Lounge?

02:45:50.960 --> 02:45:52.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but we highly discourage it.

02:45:53.109 --> 02:45:54.170
[SPEAKER_09]: VGM, Dear Orange Lounge Radio

02:46:21.334 --> 02:46:23.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys and girls get paid for doing this?

02:46:24.416 --> 02:46:24.656
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:46:28.978 --> 02:46:29.378
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

02:46:29.959 --> 02:46:30.339
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

02:46:30.619 --> 02:46:33.320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't actually at this time.

02:46:34.281 --> 02:46:40.544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you might remember at the beginning of the show I announced that Orange Lounge Radio is taking steps to become a business.

02:46:40.624 --> 02:46:43.386
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, Jamie, and Matt, we are all officially a partnership now.

02:46:43.486 --> 02:46:49.649
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may see some little ads come to the site in the future, but no panic, please.

02:46:51.201 --> 02:46:52.305
[SPEAKER_02]: We hate banner ads.

02:46:52.706 --> 02:46:53.730
[SPEAKER_02]: We hate pop-ups.

02:46:55.427 --> 02:46:56.488
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:47:26.144 --> 02:47:29.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says, Orange Lounge Radio question.

02:47:30.867 --> 02:47:45.236
[SPEAKER_02]: If there were a sequel to be made of any music game, not Bomani, that is US, such as Frequency, Amplitude, or Taiko Drum Master, that doesn't seem like it will have a sequel, which one would you want to see a sequel from?

02:47:46.217 --> 02:47:47.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on this?

02:47:48.458 --> 02:47:48.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

02:47:49.919 --> 02:47:51.560
[SPEAKER_25]: Guitaroo Man, hands down.

02:47:56.265 --> 02:48:01.288
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see another sequel to Bust a Move Groove, whatever you want to call it.

02:48:01.468 --> 02:48:02.588
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Dance Summit.

02:48:02.728 --> 02:48:05.289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'd like to see something break in the U.S.

02:48:05.330 --> 02:48:05.630
[SPEAKER_02]: market.

02:48:06.370 --> 02:48:08.991
[SPEAKER_08]: A real Bust a Move sequel with all the characters again.

02:48:09.231 --> 02:48:13.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see another one of those, because that was really the game that got me into DDR in the first place.

02:48:14.034 --> 02:48:21.897
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's Jamie's pet peeve to call those games Bust a Groove, but when I got into them, that's what I knew them as, so I have to call them Bust a Groove.

02:48:22.318 --> 02:48:22.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

02:48:23.258 --> 02:48:23.958
[SPEAKER_08]: I know more...

02:48:26.221 --> 02:48:27.682
[SPEAKER_08]: and Puyo Da.

02:48:57.502 --> 02:49:03.928
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be versus the RIA this time instead of the drug dealers and stuff.

02:49:06.210 --> 02:49:09.413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see, moving on.

02:49:10.955 --> 02:49:11.715
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else though?

02:49:11.856 --> 02:49:12.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Channel 5.

02:49:12.937 --> 02:49:13.817
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see another one.

02:49:14.358 --> 02:49:15.319
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, I love Oolala.

02:49:15.639 --> 02:49:21.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution X2 starring the Beastie Boys because they haven't done anything good in a long time.

02:49:21.474 --> 02:49:23.839
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, however, music games that don't need a sequel.

02:49:24.240 --> 02:49:27.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad Maestro, Unison, I can't think of any of those.

02:49:27.611 --> 02:49:30.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I like Technic Peak, you shut your mouth.

02:49:32.313 --> 02:49:38.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Laser1234543 asks, can you play some Taku and give a shout out to my site?

02:49:39.675 --> 02:49:43.896
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to break it to you bud, but we actually played not one, but two Taku songs earlier in the show.

02:49:44.076 --> 02:49:46.537
[SPEAKER_02]: We did Empathy and I think Karma was the other one.

02:49:47.638 --> 02:49:50.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta tune in at 6.30, otherwise you miss them, sorry.

02:49:50.879 --> 02:49:54.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if we have time we'll fit one more in, because I know Jamie will always take any excuse to play Taku.

02:49:55.080 --> 02:49:55.782
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

02:49:56.203 --> 02:49:57.607
[SPEAKER_10]: Story time with Rob.

02:49:58.809 --> 02:49:59.411
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get to that.

02:50:01.917 --> 02:50:02.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

02:50:02.617 --> 02:50:05.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, can we give a shout-out to my site?

02:50:05.879 --> 02:50:07.500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, but you will have to pay for that.

02:50:07.840 --> 02:50:08.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I'm kidding.

02:50:09.000 --> 02:50:09.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

02:50:10.001 --> 02:50:16.764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's laser123454321.com, but he says it's down right now, but I guess it's, um, Stepmania stuff?

02:50:17.124 --> 02:50:18.025
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check it out.

02:50:18.445 --> 02:50:20.446
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've been to it, I just can't remember.

02:50:20.946 --> 02:50:22.747
[SPEAKER_03]: They all start, you know, running together.

02:50:23.267 --> 02:50:24.468
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mind is just a big blur.

02:50:24.648 --> 02:50:28.329
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go look for the Japanese sites again, because I used to have a bunch of them bookmarked.

02:50:28.690 --> 02:50:29.570
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they kind of, like,

02:50:30.291 --> 02:50:30.732
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

02:50:30.932 --> 02:50:31.432
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

02:50:31.492 --> 02:50:32.253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still wondering myself.

02:50:32.853 --> 02:50:37.917
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason that I got out of it was just that I got way too busy to play.

02:50:37.937 --> 02:50:39.399
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm on Final Fantasy XI.

02:50:52.443 --> 02:51:21.871
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know what's sad is that I have had second thoughts about reactivating my account because I was up to like level 80 something on my Assassin alright you know why because it kind of a lot of the MMOs now are 3D and Ragnarok is 3D to an extent but it still has that 2D feel it has that Secret of Mana feel and I think a lot of folks that are into retro gaming have a special love for it for that reason call me crazy

02:51:22.401 --> 02:51:23.042
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's it.

02:51:25.665 --> 02:51:29.670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he means like how Burn in the Floor ratings...

02:51:44.741 --> 02:51:49.045
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about Step Mania, that's a whole... People can't rate their songs at all there.

02:51:49.805 --> 02:52:00.334
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that song I was playing earlier this week that was a 13 on heavy and they had a... Was it an expert or extreme or whatever version that was 20?

02:52:00.414 --> 02:52:02.776
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like, this is retarded.

02:52:02.796 --> 02:52:03.376
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the point?

02:52:06.018 --> 02:52:06.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love this.

02:52:08.761 --> 02:52:11.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Yeah, I don't know.

02:52:11.443 --> 02:52:11.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

02:52:13.206 --> 02:52:22.035
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it's because with different mixes, you get different developers slightly each time, so you have different opinions on what songs should be rated.

02:52:22.436 --> 02:52:27.501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they have a formula or anything, so that's the best answer I got.

02:52:28.542 --> 02:52:29.023
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Mac

02:52:33.618 --> 02:52:34.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

02:52:57.631 --> 02:53:03.775
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably still be doing this show out of our apartment, and so we'll have to have a little bit of caution about who's coming in and who's not.

02:53:03.795 --> 02:53:05.796
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, we don't want the paparazzi coming in.

02:53:05.836 --> 02:53:07.617
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the damn paparazzi in here.

02:53:09.178 --> 02:53:12.320
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is really funny, because we could have the paparazzi in here in the near future.

02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:17.703
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember back in the day when we used to have all the people that listened to our show come in?

02:53:17.983 --> 02:53:19.564
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, why is our listenership down?

02:53:19.584 --> 02:53:20.585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, because everyone's here.

02:53:22.533 --> 02:53:23.974
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't see why not.

02:53:24.034 --> 02:53:25.794
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let us know what time frame you'll be here.

02:53:26.274 --> 02:53:29.876
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the future, I don't want everybody thinking that they could come.

02:53:31.296 --> 02:53:35.418
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to try and make more public appearances at conventions in the Bay Area and stuff.

02:53:35.438 --> 02:53:37.638
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be part of our, like, trying to get our name out there stuff.

02:53:37.658 --> 02:53:38.499
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost did it this weekend.

02:53:38.519 --> 02:53:42.260
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do RekkaCon, but I had to back out for other reasons.

02:53:42.380 --> 02:53:43.700
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sorry.

02:53:44.401 --> 02:53:44.641
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

02:53:46.341 --> 02:53:49.542
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, you're special since you asked right now.

02:53:49.622 --> 02:53:50.523
[SPEAKER_02]: You can visit us.

02:53:50.623 --> 02:53:51.063
[SPEAKER_02]: Just us.

02:53:51.448 --> 02:53:57.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Send one of us an email, either Rob or Jamie or Matt at OrangeLandradio.com and we will hook you up.

02:53:58.012 --> 02:54:00.173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Loki at OrangeLandradio.com.

02:54:00.574 --> 02:54:02.695
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt auto-forwards to Loki anyways, doesn't matter.

02:54:03.135 --> 02:54:04.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a bunch of spam.

02:54:04.536 --> 02:54:07.138
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, a lot of spammers know where my address is.

02:54:07.238 --> 02:54:13.582
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can do DarkSakura and it forwards to Jamie which ends up forwarding to our other address and you can do Rob or Sky and I think it all works.

02:54:15.006 --> 02:54:17.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob is what's on the business card, so that's why I wanted to tell you that.

02:54:17.328 --> 02:54:23.254
[SPEAKER_03]: No one sends me mail, except for the one time when, you know, they sent me mail because I asked for a mail, but no one sends me mail other than spammers.

02:54:23.535 --> 02:54:27.398
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like Matrix is online today, but, um... Send Loki some email, you guys.

02:54:27.599 --> 02:54:29.260
[SPEAKER_03]: Send him some email.

02:54:29.741 --> 02:54:31.823
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I need to get rid of spam.

02:54:32.023 --> 02:54:33.264
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a new email address.

02:54:34.666 --> 02:54:34.966
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

02:54:37.180 --> 02:54:44.246
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it looks like that's all the questions we got for right now, so I'm going to close up the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

02:54:44.447 --> 02:54:45.768
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for participating there.

02:54:47.089 --> 02:54:50.612
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel reminded me to mention something funny that happened yesterday.

02:54:50.992 --> 02:54:57.118
[SPEAKER_02]: We were playing DDR, because I mentioned I went to the bowling alley that's open 24 hours, and I was playing some in the groove, and they also have DDR.

02:54:57.678 --> 02:55:00.360
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why, if it's just because I'm kind of...

02:55:01.461 --> 02:55:02.502
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:55:18.730 --> 02:55:33.634
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it as well, I did Roulette on my extra stage, and remember, extra stage is reverse 1.5 speed, because I secretly don't like doing Legend of Max, because I really can't pass it, because I'm just, I'm old, and it's too fast, and, you know, it's just too much for me.

02:55:33.994 --> 02:55:38.416
[SPEAKER_02]: So, call me a sucky DDR player, I don't care, but I can't pass Legend of Max extra stage.

02:55:38.896 --> 02:55:40.196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much, too much stamina.

02:55:40.736 --> 02:55:43.997
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do 1.5 reverse, and guess what song I end up with?

02:55:44.437 --> 02:55:46.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag, as my extra stage.

02:55:46.969 --> 02:55:51.851
[SPEAKER_02]: and it lands on bag and all I hear is Angelstar going, Ahahaha!

02:55:52.411 --> 02:55:53.692
[SPEAKER_20]: Ahahaha!

02:55:53.852 --> 02:55:54.732
[SPEAKER_20]: Sucks to be you!

02:55:55.472 --> 02:55:57.073
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not, I said no!

02:55:58.714 --> 02:56:00.214
[SPEAKER_02]: You were totally pointing and laughing at me.

02:56:00.494 --> 02:56:06.197
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad thing is I actually did it and I was kind of doing it for a little while but then I was like, I'm too old and I quit.

02:56:06.497 --> 02:56:08.618
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hold on to the bar or anything.

02:56:08.658 --> 02:56:14.300
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying I'm against bar raping, I'm just, I personally am not a bar holder player type.

02:56:16.260 --> 02:56:18.462
[SPEAKER_25]: Next time you consider bar raping, think of the bar.

02:56:20.483 --> 02:56:21.985
[SPEAKER_02]: What did the bar do to you, huh?

02:56:22.745 --> 02:56:23.046
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:56:25.047 --> 02:56:30.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I guess it's that time to start thinking about wrapping up this program.

02:56:30.772 --> 02:56:36.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for tuning in tonight, and we hope to see you next week, but we can't end it until we get our final thoughts.

02:56:37.838 --> 02:56:39.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, your final thought.

02:56:41.581 --> 02:56:44.263
[SPEAKER_25]: Needs more nachos and possibly a little more cowbell.

02:56:46.323 --> 02:56:46.663
Angel.

02:56:47.323 --> 02:56:48.924
[SPEAKER_10]: No more bag on roulette.

02:56:53.746 --> 02:56:54.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie, do you have a final thought?

02:56:55.967 --> 02:56:58.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want me to talk about the dead woman again?

02:56:58.628 --> 02:56:58.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

02:56:59.168 --> 02:56:59.809
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:57:00.029 --> 02:57:00.289
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:57:00.629 --> 02:57:01.589
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

02:57:03.030 --> 02:57:07.912
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the podcast where you'll hear more about my dog throwing poop on stuff.

02:57:10.673 --> 02:57:13.054
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark... Oh, my final thought... I'll let you have last.

02:57:13.194 --> 02:57:14.375
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is...

02:57:16.343 --> 02:57:17.824
[SPEAKER_02]: All you motherfuckers are gonna pay!

02:57:18.064 --> 02:57:19.726
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers!

02:57:20.786 --> 02:57:21.927
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

02:57:28.852 --> 02:57:29.593
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know me?

02:57:30.193 --> 02:57:31.054
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so famous.

02:57:32.855 --> 02:57:34.777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.

02:57:34.817 --> 02:57:37.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting and listening.

02:57:39.420 --> 02:57:41.162
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, you get tonight's final word.

02:57:41.402 --> 02:57:42.943
[SPEAKER_02]: One word to sum it all up.

02:57:45.124 --> 02:57:45.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Veggies!

02:57:49.685 --> 02:57:52.726
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:58:14.051 --> 02:58:15.672
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it all, we did it all, we did it all.

02:58:15.692 --> 02:58:22.215
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills, lewds, coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?

02:58:22.235 --> 02:58:22.755
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did.

02:58:23.275 --> 02:58:24.516
[SPEAKER_00]: People go, well, why don't you go into rehab?

02:58:24.536 --> 02:58:26.357
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have rehab back in the 70s.

02:58:26.937 --> 02:58:31.259
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 70s, rehab meant you'd stop doing coke, but you kept smoking pot and drinking for a couple more weeks, you know?

02:58:32.179 --> 02:58:33.740
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give me a case of Budweiser and an ounce.

02:58:33.760 --> 02:58:35.201
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta slow down, Jesus Christ.

02:58:35.761 --> 02:58:36.381
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of control.

02:58:36.401 --> 02:58:38.222
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the size of my pants, for Christ's sake.

02:58:43.203 --> 02:58:44.124
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big thing now.

02:58:44.164 --> 02:58:46.346
[SPEAKER_00]: Rehab is the big fucking secret now, isn't it, huh?

02:58:46.706 --> 02:58:48.868
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can do whatever you want, just go into rehab and solve your problems.

02:58:48.888 --> 02:58:49.829
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that the big celebrity thing?

02:58:49.849 --> 02:58:50.810
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.

02:58:51.451 --> 02:58:52.271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to get famous.

02:58:52.752 --> 02:58:56.555
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when my career starts to flag, I'm going to go on a three-month fucking bender, okay?

02:58:56.895 --> 02:59:04.382
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke and fucking pot and smack and fucking booze and drive over people and beat up my kids, go into therapy, go into rehab, come out of rehab, be on the cover of People magazine.

02:59:04.602 --> 02:59:05.003
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry!

02:59:07.565 --> 02:59:08.306
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up!

02:59:10.805 --> 02:59:15.268
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do, man, they go in a rehab and they come out and they blame everybody except themselves They blame their parents, right?

02:59:15.508 --> 02:59:18.029
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way everybody comes from a dysfunctional family all of a sudden, huh?

02:59:18.509 --> 02:59:20.450
[SPEAKER_00]: Roseanne Barr comes from a dysfunctional family?

02:59:20.490 --> 02:59:26.114
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Roseanne, she seems so normal to me The Jacksons were dysfunctional?

02:59:26.154 --> 02:59:37.280
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the Jacksons These people give each other new heads for Christmas, for Christ's sake I am sick and tired of hearing that fucking speech, you know?

02:59:38.382 --> 02:59:40.363
[SPEAKER_00]: These people come out of rehab and they always have the same story.

02:59:40.383 --> 02:59:44.445
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I became an alcoholic because my parents didn't love me enough.

02:59:45.245 --> 02:59:47.766
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I became a junkie because my parents didn't love me enough.

02:59:48.167 --> 02:59:51.608
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went into hypnosis and therapy and I found out that my parents used to hit me.

02:59:51.628 --> 02:59:54.750
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay?

02:59:55.170 --> 02:59:56.771
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking back on it, I'm glad they did.

02:59:56.791 --> 02:59:59.512
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to beating the shit out of my kids, aren't you?

03:00:02.992 --> 03:00:04.613
[SPEAKER_00]: for no reason whatsoever.

03:00:04.633 --> 03:00:05.733
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you hit me for?

03:00:05.773 --> 03:00:07.874
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up and get out there and mow the lawn, for Christ's sake.

03:00:08.454 --> 03:00:13.995
[SPEAKER_00]: There's therapy for you, mowing the lawn and crying at the same time.

03:00:14.356 --> 03:00:15.656
[SPEAKER_00]: Delirious kids in therapy again.

03:00:15.676 --> 03:00:16.496
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lawn looks great.

03:00:16.536 --> 03:00:17.337
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.

03:00:20.638 --> 03:00:21.218
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

03:00:21.978 --> 03:00:22.918
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

03:00:23.518 --> 03:00:24.519
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

03:00:25.559 --> 03:00:28.780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy because my life didn't turn out the way I thought it would.

03:00:28.800 --> 03:00:31.261
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, join the fucking club, okay?

03:00:32.210 --> 03:00:36.994
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox Life sucks, get a fucking helmet, alright?

03:00:41.818 --> 03:00:44.621
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not happy, I'm not happy Nobody's happy, okay?

03:00:44.641 --> 03:00:50.046
[SPEAKER_00]: Happiness comes in small doses, folks It's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm That's it, okay?

03:00:50.266 --> 03:00:54.349
[SPEAKER_00]: You come, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt You go to sleep, you get up in the morning and go to fucking work, okay?

03:00:55.090 --> 03:00:57.092
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it, end of fucking list

03:01:00.177 --> 03:01:01.197
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

03:01:01.277 --> 03:01:02.938
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut the fuck up, all right?

03:01:03.778 --> 03:01:07.399
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of my new book, Shut the Fuck Up by Dr. Dennis Larry.

03:01:08.499 --> 03:01:10.479
[SPEAKER_00]: A revolutionary new form of therapy.

03:01:10.499 --> 03:01:13.400
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have my patients come in, doctor, I say, shut the fuck up next.

03:01:14.620 --> 03:01:16.761
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel so, shut the fuck up next.

03:01:17.841 --> 03:01:19.741
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me feel so much better about myself, you know?

03:01:20.141 --> 03:01:22.722
[SPEAKER_00]: He just told me to shut the fuck up and nobody ever told me that before.

03:01:22.782 --> 03:01:23.662
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so much better now.

03:01:25.883 --> 03:01:27.283
[SPEAKER_00]: Whining fucking maggots.

03:01:30.345 --> 03:01:31.106
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these people quitting.

03:01:31.126 --> 03:01:36.150
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think it's a good thing, AA, and the recovery and rehab, because I've got some friends who would be dead without those programs, but you know something?

03:01:36.170 --> 03:01:41.995
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a different problem, because now they quit drinking and drugs, they're completely stressed out, and they decide to work out, which is fine.

03:01:42.336 --> 03:01:44.458
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a workout guy, but I understood Nautilus.

03:01:44.498 --> 03:01:49.582
[SPEAKER_00]: It made sense that we're arm machines and leg machines, but have you seen these people who are using the Stairmaster?

03:01:50.163 --> 03:01:52.525
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we turned into gerbils, ladies and gentlemen?

03:01:53.129 --> 03:01:57.451
[SPEAKER_00]: People are paying money to go into a health club and walk up invisible steps over and over again for an hour and a half.

03:01:57.671 --> 03:01:58.171
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?

03:01:58.411 --> 03:01:59.051
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going up!

03:01:59.371 --> 03:02:00.392
[SPEAKER_00]: And I paid for it, too.

03:02:00.432 --> 03:02:01.872
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stay here as long as I want, folks.

03:02:02.053 --> 03:02:05.194
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go up and downstairs, move into a fifth floor, walk up on the Lower East Side, okay?

03:02:06.114 --> 03:02:06.614
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?

03:02:06.694 --> 03:02:07.735
[SPEAKER_00]: A fucking chair master?

03:02:07.775 --> 03:02:09.735
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up.

03:02:09.976 --> 03:02:13.417
[SPEAKER_00]: The door master, I open the door, I go... What the fuck?

03:02:17.719 --> 03:02:21.180
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
