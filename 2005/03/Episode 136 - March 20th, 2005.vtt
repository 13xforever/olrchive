00:00.000 --> 00:02.640
Is everyone Chicken Factory, an old school play?

00:02.640 --> 00:09.740
It is so

00:09.740 --> 00:14.060
old

00:14.060 --> 00:21.600
I am sorry

00:21.560 --> 00:27.560
Yes, we are

00:27.560 --> 00:47.560

02:03.000 --> 02:06.000
B-b-b-cocky.

02:06.000 --> 02:11.000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
Isn't that special?

02:17.000 --> 02:28.000

We are live, and this is episode number 136 for this Sunday, March 20th, 2005.

02:50.000 --> 02:58.000
You're tuned in to the gaming scene's most fanatical radio station of all things B. Money.

02:58.000 --> 03:06.000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye, or you might know me as That Guy, or Asshole, or, yeah.

03:06.000 --> 03:13.000
Also joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, Ms. Dark Sackroyd, Jamie Sommers!

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
I am the lord of the dance!

03:16.000 --> 03:17.000
Are you now?

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
No.

03:20.000 --> 03:25.000
Also joining us, say hello to our other lovely co-host, uh, Loki!

03:25.000 --> 03:27.000
Hi.

03:27.000 --> 03:31.000
And also joining us tonight, we have special guests.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.000
We have Loki's fiance, who never speaks.

03:34.000 --> 03:35.000
Hello.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
Wow! We got her to say something.

03:37.000 --> 03:40.000
We have, um, and that'll be it for the whole show.

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
We have Ditter Angel.

03:42.000 --> 03:45.000
Is the mic on over there?

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
There we go.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.000
Got turned on.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.000
That's right.

03:49.000 --> 03:50.000
Now we can hear you.

03:50.000 --> 03:51.000
What'd you call me?

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
What'd you call me?

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Ditter Angel.

03:54.000 --> 04:01.000
Um, I guess, yeah, sure. Um, wrong.

04:01.000 --> 04:13.000
And also say hello to somebody who hasn't been here in a while. Usually accompanies Ditter Angel to the shows, but I hear he's got that work thing going on, but he's here tonight. Say hello to Nygoss!

04:13.000 --> 04:15.000
Eh, that work thing's a bitch, ain't it?

04:15.000 --> 04:21.000
Yeah. Real life sucks. That is the motto of Orange Laundrado, by the way. Real life sucks.

04:21.000 --> 04:27.000
We've got a fun show for you guys tonight. Well, at least we're going to try.

04:27.000 --> 04:33.000
Some actual Bahmani news to talk about. A whole lot of Night Style news going on right now this week.

04:33.000 --> 04:37.000
A whole lot of regular gaming news going on as well, because you know, you've got the PSP coming out next week.

04:37.000 --> 04:41.000
So, definitely want to talk about Night Style. Our whole first break is about Night Style.

04:41.000 --> 04:50.000
And of course, your favorite segments here on Orange Launch Radio, such as the Cage match, FUs of the Week,

04:50.520 --> 04:52.520
Yes

04:53.120 --> 04:55.120
Kicking somebody in the balls and

04:55.260 --> 04:59.880
How was your week? How is your day or as I'm going to call it the El mullet Honorary

04:59.880 --> 05:02.860
How is your week? How is your day? Because he's such a big fan of the segments, so

05:03.940 --> 05:09.140
that'll be up first when we come back the El mullet Honorary, how was your week, how was your day after this break and

05:09.440 --> 05:14.380
In this break, we're gonna hear some music from nine sound. We're gonna start it off with some fun

05:15.420 --> 05:17.160
It's fun

05:17.160 --> 05:19.600
Yeah, Bahmani is fun. Yeah

05:19.600 --> 05:20.600
Yeah, sure.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
Fun.

05:21.600 --> 05:22.600
Fun.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.600
fun

06:52.600 --> 06:54.600
You

10:52.600 --> 10:54.600
You

12:22.600 --> 12:51.600
Orange Lounge Radio

12:51.600 --> 12:54.100
Bomani Music, and more.

12:54.100 --> 12:55.400
Perfect!

12:55.400 --> 12:59.600
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break of Night Style.

12:59.600 --> 13:02.100
Starting it off with a little bit of fun by Mr. T.

13:02.100 --> 13:12.600
Karma, Taku, Starfield by Sada, and Rick being remixed by Hisashi and Nawata with Rizlum, the remix there.

13:12.600 --> 13:13.600
Hope you enjoyed that.

13:15.400 --> 13:17.600
Or if you're Jamie, you didn't enjoy that, I don't know.

13:17.600 --> 13:22.240
dot, dot, dot. What is your problem with Night Style, anyway? I love Night Style.

13:22.240 --> 13:25.720
Stupid timing bullshit, which I hope they fixed in the home version.

13:25.720 --> 13:29.960
We will find out very soon. I'm gonna order mine just so I can have it. I'm still missing

13:29.960 --> 13:33.480
Fourth Style, though. Yeah. Oh, man.

13:33.480 --> 13:37.440
You know, Night Style actually brought a lot of songs over from Fourth Style in

13:37.440 --> 13:38.200
their returning songs, like

13:38.200 --> 13:42.120
Empathy, hello, like one of the best Taku songs ever. They brought back for Night Style.

13:42.120 --> 13:42.840
That makes me happy.

13:42.840 --> 13:46.320
Empathy pisses me off. But I love Empathy! It still pisses me off. You shut your mouth!

13:46.320 --> 13:54.320
Okay. For the next, for the next break, I will do some forest-style music just to make you happy. What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

13:54.320 --> 14:05.320
Oh my god, I finally did the little flash game on the, uh, the, uh, grudge site, and it's kind of spooky.

14:05.320 --> 14:11.320
Speaking of, uh, you know, Japanese movies that became American movies, did you get a chance to go see Ring 2 yet?

14:11.320 --> 14:12.320
No.

14:12.320 --> 14:17.320
I hear it's crap, which makes me sad because the first one is seriously one of the greatest horror movies.

14:17.320 --> 14:20.320
Because it hardly deviated from the original.

14:20.320 --> 14:24.320
I'm going to go see it, but I'm still waiting for Darkwater.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.320
But I want to buy the book first.

14:27.320 --> 14:30.320
I'm so happy because Loop is going to be out soon.

14:30.320 --> 14:31.320
Really?

14:31.320 --> 14:36.320
Loop is the third book in the Ring series, which, if you read the books, it goes in a completely different direction.

14:36.320 --> 14:41.320
Although, from watching the trailers of Ring 2, it sort of seems like a tie-in almost.

14:41.320 --> 14:42.320
Hm.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.000
Cuz I could spoil it for a bunch of people.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.000
No!

14:46.000 --> 14:47.000
The book series.

14:47.000 --> 14:48.000
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

14:48.000 --> 14:52.440
I don't know who here is actually going to read the books.

14:52.440 --> 14:53.440
Come on.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.880
Does any of our listeners look like they read?

14:55.880 --> 14:56.880
I'm just kidding.

14:56.880 --> 14:57.880
I'm totally kidding you guys.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.880
Does they or do they?

15:00.880 --> 15:01.880
Exactly.

15:01.880 --> 15:02.880
I am smart.

15:02.880 --> 15:07.880
Do I look like I read?

15:07.880 --> 15:11.120
Yeah, I got you that Harry Potter book and you never read it.

15:11.120 --> 15:14.360
I, I, now wait a minute, I read two chapters.

15:14.360 --> 15:17.680
Give me a break.

15:17.680 --> 15:23.840
I, I do want to read Harry Potter someday. You can read.

15:23.840 --> 15:27.200
Anyway, uh, starting off...

15:27.200 --> 15:31.720
Starting off tonight's show...

15:31.720 --> 15:35.320
actually before we get into the El Mullet honorary how was your week, how was your day segment

15:35.320 --> 15:40.420
I want to give a little bit, I want to give a bit of congratulations

15:40.420 --> 15:44.540
to some individuals out there and in my honest opinion no one deserves

15:44.540 --> 15:46.700
congratulations more so than us

15:46.700 --> 15:50.380
so I would like to congratulate us because as of today

15:50.380 --> 15:54.300
effective now we are officially Orange Lawn Radio

15:54.300 --> 15:58.940
a legal partnership and so that means what does that mean I know who cares

15:58.940 --> 15:59.220
right

15:59.220 --> 16:02.460
What does that mean? We are taking the first step in becoming a

16:02.460 --> 16:05.460
legitimate business operation.

16:05.460 --> 16:08.780
Woohoo, we're media. Woohoo. Woohoo.

16:08.780 --> 16:11.900
We're gonna have our paparazzi.

16:11.900 --> 16:15.860
And what was great is that when we were filling out the documents, you know, there's all this legal mumbo jumbo

16:15.860 --> 16:17.300
and there's this bit in there about

16:17.300 --> 16:20.660
how to settle a dispute. And it's talking about, you know,

16:20.660 --> 16:25.460
if the partners cannot settle a dispute, then the argument will be settled by

16:25.460 --> 16:28.540
arbitration from the American Arbitration Association.

16:28.540 --> 16:33.260
And we decided, you know, we ought to actually settle these things with like a DDR match.

16:33.260 --> 16:36.580
Or, I was about to say that too. Or, I was,

16:36.580 --> 16:40.100
I also had suggested a cream corn

16:40.100 --> 16:45.740
wrestling cage match. If it's chess I'll win. He totally will win, I suck at chess, I'm horrible.

16:45.740 --> 16:49.640
Alright, anyway, so we're officially on our way.

16:49.640 --> 16:53.260
Which you know that means, because we are officially becoming a business,

16:53.260 --> 16:57.060
you can expect pop-ups to be coming to the site effective tomorrow. No, I'm kidding.

16:57.060 --> 17:01.000
until I get we will not be having pop-up ads on the site pop-up ads are evil and

17:01.000 --> 17:04.840
half of you guys have them blocked anyway so what good would it do anyway

17:04.840 --> 17:11.800
so congratulations to us we all right and if you would like to send a cash

17:11.800 --> 17:16.920
congratulations a cash notice or a cash thank you like now for you yeah just

17:16.920 --> 17:21.240
send that to you could just you can address those care of rob at orange

17:21.240 --> 17:26.120
ons radio.com and I'll make sure those get you know forwarded appropriately all

17:26.120 --> 17:32.920
Alright, and now for the El Mullet honorary how was your week, how was your day segment?

17:32.920 --> 17:36.040
A little bit about us and how our day is going.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.040
I worked.

17:37.040 --> 17:38.040
Jamie.

17:38.040 --> 17:44.200
I worked, I went to school, yay, I exercised a lot, yay, um, I actually though, I was all

17:44.200 --> 17:47.980
nervous about my photoshop assignment and then I found that he postponed in another

17:47.980 --> 17:48.980
two weeks.

17:48.980 --> 17:53.440
Excuse me and I just burped, nacho burp.

17:53.440 --> 18:00.440
Anyway, um, it was, it was very cool, um, yesterday I hung out with, um, Tia and some

18:03.000 --> 18:07.920
of her friends, and I went to Curves. I had never been before.

18:07.920 --> 18:11.160
Isn't Curves the place that plays Jesus music while you work out?

18:11.160 --> 18:15.840
No, they played, like, dance music. Oh. I heard they play Jesus music. That's why,

18:15.840 --> 18:19.280
you know, that's why my mom stopped going. No, this is the one downtown.

18:19.280 --> 18:22.280
Oh, well, I guess maybe it's different. It depends on which one you go to, because

18:22.280 --> 18:27.820
I think they're sort of I think they're franchised. Well, maybe that's it then. But this one was downtown

18:28.820 --> 18:34.760
It was kind of neat. It wasn't, you know, the exercise I need but I still got a workout out of it

18:35.340 --> 18:42.140
But it uses resistance machine machines and these bouncy things that you hop up and down on in between to the resistance machines

18:42.140 --> 18:46.060
And you're only doing this like 15-30 seconds each time

18:46.300 --> 18:50.220
But as you go through a couple of circuits of it, you're like whoo tired

18:50.220 --> 18:55.540
But it wasn't really, I was tired but not like fatigued, not like I'm supposed to be.

18:55.540 --> 18:57.420
I didn't hurt.

18:57.420 --> 19:02.260
And unless it hurts, for me, it's not a workout.

19:02.260 --> 19:11.780
So today I played like three hours of Silent Hill 3 and sat around on my ass and that was

19:11.780 --> 19:13.120
about it.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.120
It rained.

19:14.120 --> 19:16.020
It was thundering and lightning last night.

19:16.020 --> 19:20.060
Oh my gosh, the thunder woke me up at like 3 o'clock in the morning.

19:20.060 --> 19:21.060
I was so scared.

19:21.060 --> 19:22.060
Oh, it helped me sleep.

19:22.060 --> 19:23.060
Thank you for reminding me, by the way.

19:23.060 --> 19:28.360
In case the storms come back, just to alert all our listeners, if we suddenly drop, like

19:28.360 --> 19:32.140
we're suddenly disconnected, that means the Orange Lounge Studios got hit with lightning.

19:32.140 --> 19:33.140
It stopped raining, though.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.940
So, yeah, I know, but, you know, you never know, it might pick back up.

19:35.940 --> 19:39.060
It doesn't thunder and lightning here by my standards.

19:39.060 --> 19:40.060
I know, I know.

19:40.060 --> 19:43.700
I have fried four modems, personally.

19:43.700 --> 19:47.180
Understand, we here on the West Coast, and I realize we're an international show, we

19:47.180 --> 19:52.800
We here on the West Coast are big pussies when it comes to storms, because it just doesn't

19:52.800 --> 19:55.180
rain here like it does on the East Coast, okay?

19:55.180 --> 19:57.420
I know, I'm familiar with how it rains on the East Coast.

19:57.420 --> 20:01.520
We don't get hurricanes or any of that shit, so like when it starts raining hard and there's

20:01.520 --> 20:04.840
a lot of lightning, we're like, oh my god, run!

20:04.840 --> 20:06.360
And then I sit back and laugh.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.400
We got our first tornado, like in ten years.

20:09.400 --> 20:13.840
We had a tornado, like two weeks ago, and people were freaking out because it actually

20:13.840 --> 20:14.840
touched down.

20:14.840 --> 20:19.280
Now granted, I think it may be like picked up a cow and moved it six feet, and that was

20:19.280 --> 20:23.440
like the extent of the damage, but yeah, I mean people were freaking out, they're like

20:23.440 --> 20:25.160
oh my god a tornado!

20:25.160 --> 20:31.600
Just bear in mind, if we suddenly drop, just keep this mental image in mind, we're all

20:31.600 --> 20:35.480
piled up in the bathtub and Rob is on top.

20:35.480 --> 20:36.480
Don't you know it, I will be on top.

20:36.480 --> 20:40.940
If we drop it means the tornado dropped a cow on us.

20:40.940 --> 20:44.000
There's no place like Orange Lounge, there's no place like Orange Lounge.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!

21:14.000 --> 21:20.040
themselves. My mom's like a Jewish hag. Like, she's a total goy, okay? But, I don't know

21:20.040 --> 21:24.680
what you'd call that. But, so she was like, you know, out of respect for her Jewish friends,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.960
she said, you know, I don't think they should be playing Jesus music here because that might

21:27.960 --> 21:31.840
be offensive to some people. So, I just thought that was interesting. That's my, that's the

21:31.840 --> 21:37.740
story about my mom and Curves. It was in Roseville, which I realize means nothing to you guys

21:37.740 --> 21:43.960
that are out there listening internationally. But imagine, like, a town that is really white

21:43.960 --> 21:46.960
and has no culture whatsoever. That's Roseville.

21:46.960 --> 21:49.960
And you have to pay long distance to call, like, into Sacramento.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.960
Yeah, seriously, and there's a-

21:51.960 --> 21:54.960
You guys are so far removed from reality.

21:54.960 --> 21:59.960
There's a Starbucks on every corner. I mean, I don't know how to split it.

21:59.960 --> 22:00.960
Anyway.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.960
Sorry.

22:01.960 --> 22:06.960
Um, I'm gonna keep going for the rest of the week just because I have a free week.

22:06.960 --> 22:09.960
Um, I'm gonna ask her, though, if she'll let me do a write-up on it,

22:09.960 --> 22:14.320
I'm wanting to promote, you know, more fitness for everybody.

22:14.320 --> 22:18.540
You know, people need to get off their asses and actually do something for their health,

22:18.540 --> 22:25.080
so I'm hoping that I can do a nice write-up on it and encourage people that if, you know,

22:25.080 --> 22:30.380
the good thing about this is that it's an all-women gym, so if you're feeling self-conscious

22:30.380 --> 22:31.380
–

22:31.380 --> 22:32.820
Sorry, go ahead.

22:32.820 --> 22:33.820
I'm not laughing at that.

22:33.820 --> 22:34.820
I'm laughing at something else.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.160
In general, though, like for women in general, there are – there's coverings on the windows

22:38.160 --> 22:42.720
nobody can peek in and watch you. It's because you all exercise topless right?

22:42.720 --> 22:50.720
No. See that would be hot and all topless too. And they are very encouraging and since it's so small you

22:50.720 --> 22:53.600
don't have to worry about a big gym full of people at different because

22:53.600 --> 22:56.380
everybody is going to be at their own fitness level but everybody's really

22:56.380 --> 22:59.880
supportive so it's a really good place for someone who may be new to exercise

22:59.880 --> 23:05.800
or looking just to lean up a bit not necessarily bulk up or is self-conscious.

23:05.800 --> 23:11.760
They, the reason why I was giggling is because they have a guy's, they have an all-guy gymnasium

23:11.760 --> 23:12.760
called CUTS.

23:12.760 --> 23:14.640
Yeah, it's the same thing I think.

23:14.640 --> 23:17.600
But they don't cover the windows, like, you know.

23:17.600 --> 23:20.520
Well, Rob just made a valid case for cross-dressing.

23:20.520 --> 23:26.760
It would, oh whatever, this is not a bad episode of Bosom Buddies, okay?

23:26.760 --> 23:28.400
My life is not an episode of Bosom Buddies.

23:28.400 --> 23:32.760
I am not that interested in going to curves just to check out women exercising.

23:32.760 --> 23:33.760
Although...

23:33.760 --> 23:34.760
Well, you wouldn't.

23:34.760 --> 23:38.880
This is interesting because, going into my, I'll just start with my week and my day since

23:38.880 --> 23:39.880
this kind of leads into it.

23:39.880 --> 23:44.580
I was actually apartment hunting today, scouting out where the new home of Orange Lawn Studios

23:44.580 --> 23:46.080
will be for a little while.

23:46.080 --> 23:48.720
Oh, I thought you said you were done.

23:48.720 --> 23:50.200
No, I went to go blow my nose.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.520
Oh, I'm sorry, well then go ahead and finish and I'll tell my piece.

23:53.520 --> 23:57.560
The rest of it was spent working on my wedding, which I signed up for this online wedding

23:57.560 --> 23:58.560
thing.

23:58.560 --> 24:02.520
They had me budgeted at $15,000, which I find incredibly retarded.

24:02.520 --> 24:07.520
I chopped it down to 5,000, and that's just for the essentials of having a very basic

24:07.520 --> 24:10.840
ceremony and paying for food.

24:10.840 --> 24:18.880
And then I did some house hunting, and found out that those online foreclosure sites suck.

24:18.880 --> 24:22.040
So I'm going to have to see about getting a bank less somewhere.

24:22.040 --> 24:26.040
And now I'm done.

24:26.040 --> 24:27.040
Okay.

24:27.040 --> 24:29.080
Oh yeah, apartment hunting.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.600
Okay, so I was apartment hunting today.

24:31.600 --> 24:35.280
And me and my buddy Christopher, you know, we're both, you know, if you haven't heard,

24:35.280 --> 24:38.280
I happen to be a gay male, and my buddy Christopher is also a gay male.

24:38.280 --> 24:44.160
I don't think we exactly exude gay when we go out in public.

24:44.160 --> 24:49.240
I mean, I realize people figure me out after spending quality time with me, but I think

24:49.240 --> 24:54.280
when I go in in a professional setting, I don't think I'm like, you know, hi everybody!

24:54.280 --> 24:57.520
You know, I don't think I'm like Richard Simmons gay, okay?

24:57.520 --> 25:01.200
Like I think I'm pretty, you know, quote unquote just like everybody else.

25:01.200 --> 25:07.440
I don't know how to say it. I'm on low heat, yes. If gayness was an oven setting, I'm like

25:07.440 --> 25:09.840
hold warm. That's me. My flames are hold warm.

25:09.840 --> 25:12.240
You're not like Lagerfeld. No, I'm not like Carl Lagerfeld.

25:12.240 --> 25:15.400
You don't have the fan. No, I don't carry a fucking fan. I mean,

25:15.400 --> 25:17.960
that stuff. Your ab would fucking make you differ on that

25:17.960 --> 25:20.560
one, though. Well, we went to an apartment complex today.

25:20.560 --> 25:24.100
We went to an apartment complex, and when we walked in, the guy was like, okay, what

25:24.100 --> 25:25.960
kind of size apartment are you interested in getting in?

25:25.960 --> 25:29.040
We said, well, maybe like a two or three bedroom. And he's like, oh, you guys don't want a one

25:29.040 --> 25:36.000
bedroom?" And we were like, uh, it's, it's not like that. And he's like, oh, okay. Like,

25:36.000 --> 25:40.360
he just assumed that we were together and we wanted a one bedroom. And I realized that

25:40.360 --> 25:45.040
it's possible for heterosexual males to share a one bedroom, like college, you know, things

25:45.040 --> 25:51.440
like that. That's perfectly normal. But it's, like, once you get to be 26, you know, unless

25:51.440 --> 25:55.120
you're poor. Yeah, time, it's about time to get your own bedroom unless, you know, you're

25:55.120 --> 25:58.240
poor. But I like to think I make reasonably good money where I can afford my own bedroom,

25:58.240 --> 26:04.200
and so does Christopher. So anyway, my point. He was giving us the tour. So now we're straight

26:04.200 --> 26:08.200
in his minds because, you know, he offended us with the gay comment. So we were walking

26:08.200 --> 26:11.960
around and he showed us the gymnasium and there were these two girls and they were pretty

26:11.960 --> 26:16.000
attractive. These two girls that were in the gymnasium work it out and he's like, yeah,

26:16.000 --> 26:20.360
we got girls that work out in this gym. And the girls, like you could tell, were embarrassed.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.960
And I was just like, oh, those poor girls. And like I just wanted to tell them, you have

26:23.960 --> 26:28.120
nothing to worry about. I'm not checking you out in that kind of way. I'm strictly looking

26:28.120 --> 26:34.660
at the equipment you're using but you know I don't want to go there yeah I was

26:34.660 --> 26:39.480
checking out their equipment that's a very top-heavy equipment there at the

26:39.480 --> 26:45.240
gymnasium anyway so yeah apartment hunting that was my um how's my day oh

26:45.240 --> 26:48.920
what else I do this week I went to Country Club lanes yesterday which is

26:48.920 --> 26:53.740
one of our local arcades it's the 24-hour arcade here in Sacramento and so

26:53.740 --> 26:57.440
I got to play a little bit in the groove I'll um you know which I've been playing

26:57.440 --> 27:01.920
a little more and more of. I'm really trying to warm up to In The Groove. Nothing's really

27:01.920 --> 27:08.640
changed on my opinion on it. But I also played Beatmania 3, 6 Mix, and I got to watch Andrew

27:08.640 --> 27:14.440
play Instant Love, which was the shit, because I love that song. But I was pissed off because

27:14.440 --> 27:19.360
the two-player side, all the keys were broken, so I cannot play center mode. And I am a turntable

27:19.360 --> 27:24.120
left kind of guy, so that's why Beatmania 5 Key Machines pissed me off, because I have

27:24.120 --> 27:30.840
to play center and it's all weird but left pride yo I guess that's my week I

27:30.840 --> 27:35.440
don't have anything else interesting to share left pride in my ass you know what

27:35.440 --> 27:40.120
you want to settle this with a cream corn match no all right this could be

27:40.120 --> 27:46.080
our first dispute this could be our first official dispute all right Wow I

27:46.080 --> 27:50.040
feel all official and shit okay let me go to the pantry get some corn Magus you

27:50.040 --> 27:52.040
You have a mic. Tell us about your weekend or day.

27:52.040 --> 27:59.040
Alright. Just, well, mostly all the same. Work, school, work, school, work, school.

27:59.040 --> 28:07.040
Finally got sick of it. Took a weekend off. Went to RecaCon yesterday. Shout-outs to everyone there.

28:07.040 --> 28:18.040
Came in day after just completely blowing my legs out on DDR, and the rest is going on right now.

28:18.040 --> 28:20.040
Nothing much to talk about, though.

28:23.040 --> 28:26.040
Alright, how boring you are. Just kidding.

28:26.040 --> 28:31.040
He's a working boy now. Jamie, this boy has grown up so fast right before our eyes.

28:33.040 --> 28:34.040
Good.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.040
Remember when-

28:35.040 --> 28:38.040
I smell a repressed dot dot frickin' dot.

28:38.040 --> 28:41.040
Remember when he was an angsty little Republican asshole?

28:41.040 --> 28:45.040
Now he's only a semi-angsty Republican asshole.

28:45.040 --> 28:47.040
With a sense of responsibility.

28:47.040 --> 28:50.040
That's okay, we'll beat the partisanship out of you.

28:50.040 --> 28:52.040
It's not like I'm crawling in my skin or anything.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.040
And you know I love you.

28:54.040 --> 28:56.040
In a heterosexual way.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.040
In a heterosexual top-heavy way.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.040
Angel!

28:59.040 --> 29:01.040
Hey, as long as it's top-heavy.

29:01.040 --> 29:03.040
Angel.

29:03.040 --> 29:04.040
You're weak in your day.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.040
Stop laughing.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.040
I can't help it.

29:08.040 --> 29:10.040
Stop laughing. This is a serious discussion.

29:10.040 --> 29:12.040
Oh really?

29:12.040 --> 29:14.040
You're the one holding nachos in your lap.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.040
Anyway.

29:16.040 --> 29:22.240
needed to know that. No, but yeah, they were just there, whatever. I don't know, just work

29:22.240 --> 29:31.360
in school and I had finals this week, so yay. Half of my school days are done for right

29:31.360 --> 29:36.160
now and that's cool because it's going to be a much lighter load in the next nine weeks

29:36.160 --> 29:45.120
so that's cool. Not much going on, I guess, except for Racket Con yesterday, which was

29:45.120 --> 29:48.120
I got to see all the people that I haven't seen in like two years, so...

29:52.120 --> 29:55.120
Residence of East Contra Costa County.

29:55.120 --> 30:03.320
anime convention. Okay, cool. I wanted to go. I saw we. That's alright. If anybody that

30:03.320 --> 30:06.520
went to Wreck-A-Con is listening, please don't tell me how fabulous the convention was, because

30:06.520 --> 30:11.640
I'm quite bitter. I'm just kidding, I'll get over it. Wendell sends his love. Aw, I miss

30:11.640 --> 30:14.560
Wendell. And Jahi, and everyone else. Aw, I'm gonna play the Step Squad promo after

30:14.560 --> 30:19.720
the next break, so I can hear them. Yay! Okay. Anyway, yeah, so, everyone was there, it was

30:19.720 --> 30:27.220
cool I got chased by an agent that was weird oh I thought you said I got chased

30:27.220 --> 30:34.000
by an Asian no I'm like what we had an agent Smith cosplayer oh let's just say

30:34.000 --> 30:40.560
he's been discouraging me from playing playing MXO lately my you were playing

30:40.560 --> 30:45.680
this I sense a dispute and cream corn I see a

30:45.680 --> 30:51.680
I'm tempted to think that they're going to turn into that Agent Smith cosplayer.

30:51.680 --> 30:57.680
Out of curiosity, how is MXO? Like, besides, I saw Loki play it for like 15 minutes, but that was about it?

30:57.680 --> 31:00.680
It needs work, but it's got potential.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.680
Okay.

31:02.680 --> 31:14.680
Sega and, you know, Warner Bros. are completely new to MMOs, so they got a lot to learn from, say, Final Fantasy XI, World of Warcraft, or even EverQuest. They've still got a lot to learn.

31:14.680 --> 31:18.680
And that was your MMO update. Sorry, Angel.

31:18.680 --> 31:21.680
As I just taunted in front of the mic, that was funny.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.680
Alright, um, let's see. Yeah, record's on yesterday.

31:24.680 --> 31:30.680
CCL last night. Yay for CCL, or something. Damn those card systems! Damn them!

31:30.680 --> 31:33.680
Those stupid cards you wouldn't rate, and I'm going, what the hell?

31:33.680 --> 31:37.680
Oh, I know. What is up with arcades that use cards?

31:37.680 --> 31:41.680
Yeah, cards with a little magnetic strip on the back so it looks like it's all important or something.

31:41.680 --> 31:44.180
The card for CCL is ugly, too.

31:44.180 --> 31:49.180
I'm gonna go put the card up on the webcam, www.orangelonsradio.com.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.180
It's not fugly, it's more fugly.

31:52.180 --> 31:55.180
People are wondering when MXO is. The Matrix Online.

31:55.180 --> 31:56.180
Yes.

31:57.680 --> 31:59.180
Put the card on the cam.

32:00.180 --> 32:04.680
And other than that, not much except for coming to show today.

32:04.680 --> 32:07.680
So there's not that much in my life going on.

32:08.180 --> 32:09.180
Yet.

32:09.180 --> 32:11.540
Or something except for spring break starting tomorrow

32:12.940 --> 32:14.940
Yay, spring break whoo-hoo

32:16.220 --> 32:19.700
Where I'm going to do nothing but play MMOs all week or something

32:21.140 --> 32:24.600
What you're not going to nude beach you dumbass

32:28.500 --> 32:32.220
Really screw the nude beach I'm gonna go to curves because they all exercise topless there

32:32.220 --> 32:39.220
at the nude beach, heck yeah

32:41.700 --> 32:44.860
alright anyway

32:44.860 --> 32:48.540
is that it angel? yes okay sorry that's right hand the mic off to loki

32:48.540 --> 32:52.580
why loki why do you have gummy bears stuck to your forehead I don't

32:52.580 --> 32:55.780
what the hell I was bored I don't know

32:55.780 --> 33:00.580
because they stick that's why

33:00.580 --> 33:04.580
Yeah, it's because I touch myself at night.

33:04.580 --> 33:08.580
I don't know.

33:08.580 --> 33:12.580
It's pretty stuck. Want to eat it off?

33:12.580 --> 33:16.580
Oh, that is gross! Oh my god! Such blatant heterosexuality in my home.

33:16.580 --> 33:20.580
Anyways, just so you guys know, because this isn't TV,

33:20.580 --> 33:24.580
Loki's fiance just ate the gummy bear off of his forehead

33:24.580 --> 33:28.580
and like totally licked his forehead in the process. You don't know where that's been.

33:28.580 --> 33:36.580
I put worse things in my nose off his body, too.

33:36.580 --> 33:40.580
Do we have a bleeper? Do we have a dump button or a bleeper?

33:40.580 --> 33:42.580
Oh wait, I forgot we're internet.

33:42.580 --> 33:49.580
No, so, what did I do this week? Not much. I interviewed for my games position. I did really well.

33:49.580 --> 33:50.580
What are you doing?

33:50.580 --> 33:58.820
doing? And so, like, what else did I do? Oh, well, I interviewed really well for it, so

33:58.820 --> 34:03.980
I'm going to get it. Yeah. So, that's game sales position and I get to sell games and

34:03.980 --> 34:08.580
I hopefully get free games and that kind of wonderful stuff. It pays more money, so that's

34:08.580 --> 34:17.460
all that's good. More presents for me. Yeah, sure. Anyways. Yeah, this one broke her wedding

34:17.460 --> 34:24.500
ring engagement ring it was salty craftsmanship do not shop at Zales but

34:24.500 --> 34:27.700
they will give you a new ring if you break your other one like a brand new

34:27.700 --> 34:33.540
one that's shiny yeah they suck but anyways then we got pretzels and that

34:33.540 --> 34:37.860
was cool I love those goddamn pretzels you just eat them and you want more and

34:37.860 --> 34:43.340
more and all mall pretzels are the shit with like the mustard mrs. fields

34:43.340 --> 34:47.220
Pretzel time pretzels are the fucking bomb. You eat them and you're just like,

34:47.220 --> 34:49.940
need more. More. Crack. More.

34:49.940 --> 34:53.260
You can get those huge soft, like, pretzels at Costco.

34:53.260 --> 34:57.420
Yeah, they're not the same. Not the same at all. I know, but they're close. They're so good.

34:57.420 --> 35:01.300
It's like, I bought four one time and I ate them all.

35:01.300 --> 35:06.100
And when I got full, I waited until I became un-full and I ate them at rest. It's just

35:06.100 --> 35:09.700
that good. That's like me and drumsticks. Like the ice cream

35:09.700 --> 35:13.700
I know, they're so good. So then, what else did we do this week?

35:13.700 --> 35:17.700
Um, we, uh, let's see here.

35:17.700 --> 35:21.700
Got the apartment stuff finalized, so we're going to be moving into our place on the 16th

35:21.700 --> 35:25.700
of next month, and then, um,

35:25.700 --> 35:29.700
there's some other stuff I did. Loki and I will no longer be living together

35:29.700 --> 35:33.700
as of next month. Freedom! And I'll be, um,

35:33.700 --> 35:37.700
living with Nellie. Aw. Wait a minute,

35:37.700 --> 35:41.700
You're moving in together before you're married?

35:41.700 --> 35:44.700
Sinners living in sin?

35:44.700 --> 35:45.700
Whatever.

35:45.700 --> 35:47.700
Okay, anyways, so, um...

35:47.700 --> 35:50.700
How did you know the name of our apartment complex?

35:50.700 --> 35:52.700
So, um, we're at...

35:52.700 --> 35:55.700
My household will be all gay.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.700
Ew!

35:56.700 --> 35:58.700
We should move into, like, the same thing.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.700
Anyway, sorry, we keep cutting Loki off.

36:01.700 --> 36:03.700
Anyways, um...

36:03.700 --> 36:06.700
So, I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week, as usual,

36:06.700 --> 36:36.680
just because I can't. I would be playing other games, but some person hasn't returned my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so I haven't been able to play that. So I got bored and I bought more games. I bought Dog's Life and Gran Turismo 4, and I must say I can't drive for shit in Gran Turismo 4. I have the first thing you do, and I don't know why people do this, at least I did, is you drive your car. You pick your car in the game, and so I picked my Ford Focus, and guess what?

36:36.680 --> 36:43.240
But it sucks! It's not a racecar! Then, then I was playing the rally mode where you basically...

36:43.240 --> 36:49.360
Well, as a reminder, you won't afford. Whatever. Anyways, so I was playing, um, the rally mode

36:49.360 --> 36:53.920
or whatever, versus, like, they had some, like, really nice Subaru rally car, you know,

36:53.920 --> 37:00.200
versus the boat that I picked, and obviously the rally car beat my boat, and that pissed

37:00.200 --> 37:07.200
me off. So, yeah, so, anyways, but I'll talk more about those games on the podcast, which

37:07.200 --> 37:14.460
you can download every week. Ha ha! Um, so yeah, I did that, and, um, all I must say,

37:14.460 --> 37:22.320
a little teaser for the podcast, I've been throwing poop on cars. Poop on cars. He's

37:22.320 --> 37:28.820
not kidding. Not kidding. As a dog, I've taken shits in places I've never known that I could

37:28.820 --> 37:35.380
take shits in. And so, it's a very fun game. You gotta seriously try it. And Gran Turismo

37:35.380 --> 37:41.620
4, beautiful. Gran Turismo 4 is a sexy game. It looks very sexy. They have, like, this,

37:41.620 --> 37:46.340
like, really, like, operatic, you know, like, music in the beginning, and I'm like, what

37:46.340 --> 37:52.180
the hell? But I miss the Cardigans song that was in Gran Turismo 2. They have Crystal Method

37:52.180 --> 37:57.020
in this, this game, which is pretty cool. I haven't seen the soundtrack list yet, but

37:57.020 --> 38:01.020
It had some Crystal Method in there, that was kind of neat.

38:01.020 --> 38:06.020
And I don't know, it was just fun stuff playing a few sim files.

38:06.020 --> 38:11.020
Once again, my wrist was sore from playing Step Mania.

38:11.020 --> 38:16.020
Hey, I'm getting better, okay?

38:16.020 --> 38:20.020
You know, pretty soon, no, I've got masturbation down.

38:20.020 --> 38:22.020
I'm talking about Step Mania.

38:22.020 --> 38:24.020
I'm not worried about that.

38:24.020 --> 38:27.140
Oh, he already triple-a'd masturbation, sorry.

38:27.140 --> 38:28.140
Exactly.

38:28.140 --> 38:31.600
Oh, by the way, I should mention this, because it was quite funny.

38:31.600 --> 38:33.820
I found out- no, not masturbation.

38:33.820 --> 38:37.420
I found out last week my mom was listening to our show.

38:37.420 --> 38:41.720
Oh, yeah, maybe I should stop saying- And masturbating?

38:41.720 --> 38:46.640
I should stop saying things like that.

38:46.640 --> 38:53.780
So Matt- if Matthew's mom is listening, Matthew has never masturbated in his life, and he's

38:53.780 --> 38:58.780
She's never looked at a girl with impure thoughts, and he gets straight A's in school.

38:58.780 --> 39:00.780
I'm good at school.

39:00.780 --> 39:02.780
Remember that one time she walked in on her?

39:02.780 --> 39:03.780
She's gonna...

39:03.780 --> 39:10.780
Oh my God!

39:10.780 --> 39:14.780
This is why Nellie doesn't get a microphone on the show.

39:14.780 --> 39:17.780
I still think the mic picked that up, but...

39:17.780 --> 39:19.780
I think it did.

39:19.780 --> 39:21.780
Judging by the reaction.

39:30.780 --> 39:32.780
I am at a loss for words. I just...

39:32.780 --> 39:33.780
You're not listening.

39:33.780 --> 39:34.780
I don't know what to say.

39:34.780 --> 39:38.780
Not anymore. She needs my sister to help her, you know, with finding stuff.

39:42.780 --> 39:44.780
She's not in the chat room. She wouldn't even know how to get in the chat room.

39:44.780 --> 39:48.780
Seriously, MPQ's got a point. This is why you don't tell your parents what you do on the internet.

39:48.780 --> 39:53.060
internet but you know whatever parents find out just like they find out about

39:53.060 --> 39:56.060
masturbation they find out about your your radio show on the internet I'm a

39:56.060 --> 40:02.420
freaking adult okay it doesn't matter it's whatever yeah

40:02.420 --> 40:05.580
anyways I'm done that's all I did all right

40:05.580 --> 40:12.620
Nelly you want to share anything about your week in your day okay before we get

40:12.620 --> 40:15.380
a break we are gonna go to a break pretty soon here but I want to bring up

40:15.380 --> 40:18.860
some news I do want to talk about the money news we'll get to that after the

40:18.860 --> 40:23.480
break I want to talk about this because I know a lot of Bahmani nerds are into

40:23.480 --> 40:27.780
this series as well and this is definitely worth mentioning but it's

40:27.780 --> 40:33.180
been a little a little mention in Nintendo Power a little tiny little slip

40:33.180 --> 40:40.300
in Namco's upcoming calendar says that Katamari Dimash EDS is on the way so

40:40.300 --> 40:44.300
something for you guys to think about there and my question is how in the hell

40:44.300 --> 40:48.460
are you going to control that? That's going to be weird. Like is it going to be that faux

40:48.460 --> 40:54.560
analog thing like Mario 64 has? Well, here's how it's going to work. It's quite simple.

40:54.560 --> 40:59.960
You're going to have, you know, not faux analog, but you're going to have the two directional

40:59.960 --> 41:05.060
button and you have your four buttons. Those are your two sticks right there. Either that

41:05.060 --> 41:11.100
or you can use the stylus to roll it. You just kind of move the stylus. There you go.

41:11.100 --> 41:16.100
Like, you could just keep, like, rolling it forward to the side using the stylus? I guess that would work.

41:16.100 --> 41:24.100
It's nice that the DS is going to get a game, you know, because we keep hearing about all this cool stuff that's going to come out on the DS.

41:24.100 --> 41:33.100
Dude, I looked out, okay, yesterday when I was at GameStop, looking at games, and then they have, I looked at the wall of all the stuff that's supposed to be launching with the PSP,

41:33.100 --> 41:40.100
And then I walked over to the DS section and it was literally half a shelf, not even a shelf, it was a small shelf.

41:40.100 --> 41:47.100
They had maybe ten games, maybe, and that was everything that's out right now and I'm like, God the DS sucks.

41:47.100 --> 41:52.100
But the thing is that the DS as a system, it doesn't suck, I mean...

41:52.100 --> 41:54.100
Well why don't they release some games then?

41:54.100 --> 41:58.100
I don't know, cause they're bastard people, I have no other explanation for that.

41:58.100 --> 42:01.100
You know what, other systems did the exact same thing and it failed horribly.

42:01.100 --> 42:05.100
Please don't say un-gauge or I'll hate you forever.

42:05.100 --> 42:13.100
No, those both sucked from launch, but I'm talking about Nintendo 64, that failed as a system.

42:13.100 --> 42:19.100
And it's because there wasn't that many games out for it. And also, um, Atari Lynx.

42:19.100 --> 42:22.100
But, it did have, um, Pokemon Snap.

42:22.100 --> 42:25.100
Yeah, Pokemon Dash out right now.

42:25.100 --> 42:32.100
DS, the thing about the DS is that it does have a lot of good games. Coming soon. Animal Crossing DS, coming soon.

42:32.100 --> 42:33.100
Oh yeah, it's September.

42:33.100 --> 42:36.100
Woo, fun! That's assuming they don't push it back.

42:36.100 --> 42:37.100
I know, I know.

42:38.100 --> 42:51.100
See, the problem with DS though is new technology. Not everyone knows how to market for dual screens. Not everyone is willing to take the plunge. I mean, PSP, everyone knows how to do one screen.

42:51.100 --> 42:54.100
Yeah, Castlevania DS will make it all better.

42:54.100 --> 42:57.100
Castlevania DS will be my god when it's out.

42:57.100 --> 42:58.100
I know.

42:58.100 --> 43:01.100
Speaking of PSP, is anybody planning on picking one up?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.100
I already have ours reserved.

43:03.100 --> 43:06.100
Do you guys have a demo in the house because of what your man does?

43:06.100 --> 43:08.100
Nobody's got one at the store.

43:08.100 --> 43:10.100
Oh, right on. Has he given you any feedback on it?

43:10.100 --> 43:12.100
Said it was fun.

43:12.100 --> 43:13.100
Have you gotten to play it at all yet?

43:13.100 --> 43:16.100
Haven't really been all that excited about playing it.

43:16.100 --> 43:22.100
I want a PSP, but I don't want it right now because I just have too much of the shit going on,

43:22.100 --> 43:26.980
sucks because I, I wish somebody would just send me a free one. I need Wipeout Pure. There

43:26.980 --> 43:33.540
are a lot, oh see, I want Lumines. Oh. I would buy it from Metal Gear Acid. See, all these

43:33.540 --> 43:38.540
cool games coming out like right around launch period. And then the DS, like, no, what did

43:38.540 --> 43:42.700
we get at launch? We got Mario, which was cool, but it was a rehashed game. Eventually.

43:42.700 --> 43:48.380
Spiderman 2. What did he do? Feel the magic. Fun for about 5 minutes. Fun, fun, fun, fun.

43:48.380 --> 43:50.380
Mr. Driller DS.

43:50.380 --> 43:52.380
And eventually we're getting some fun stuff.

43:52.380 --> 43:55.380
WarioWare Twisted. Sorry, Touched.

43:55.380 --> 43:57.380
Touched is already out. I have Touched.

43:57.380 --> 43:58.380
We've finally gotten to that.

43:58.380 --> 43:59.380
Yeah.

43:59.380 --> 44:00.380
Okay, so finally.

44:00.380 --> 44:03.380
Castlevania DS will be out soon. Supposedly.

44:03.380 --> 44:05.380
Not soon enough. That's my problem.

44:05.380 --> 44:08.380
Wario Kart.

44:08.380 --> 44:10.380
The internet thing I'm excited about too.

44:10.380 --> 44:14.380
We can save the general gaming stuff for the podcast.

44:14.380 --> 44:18.340
know but it's worth talking about now I know a lot of you guys are curious about

44:18.340 --> 44:21.340
that kind of stuff and the PSP is pretty big news right now you know with it

44:21.340 --> 44:26.220
coming out next week and all I'm just too poor honestly otherwise I would

44:26.220 --> 44:29.320
totally get one if I had a lot of money I'd buy one right this week but I'm a

44:29.320 --> 44:35.380
long-term gamer and the battery life thing is still kind of no all right uh

44:35.380 --> 44:39.220
we're gonna take a break in this break I promised a Dark Sacker we'd do some

44:39.220 --> 44:42.580
forest-style music so that's exactly we're gonna do and we're gonna start off

44:42.580 --> 44:48.440
with empathy because that song is rad. We'll be back after this with more Orange

44:48.440 --> 44:51.920
Lawns Radio and some news on Night Style and you know that kind of involves

44:51.920 --> 44:55.260
indirectly some news from Port Style. So we'll be back after this with Orange

44:55.260 --> 45:02.820
That's

45:02.820 --> 45:09.880
now

45:09.880 --> 45:16.900
out

47:46.900 --> 47:48.900
Love, love, love, love, love

49:16.900 --> 49:20.900
A thing to be found, a thing to be found

49:20.900 --> 49:24.900
I'm still not alone, it turns out

49:24.900 --> 49:28.900
It's the final countdown

49:30.900 --> 49:34.900
The final countdown

49:36.900 --> 49:40.900
The final countdown

49:40.900 --> 49:45.900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

50:40.900 --> 50:41.900
Why?

50:41.900 --> 50:42.900
Why?

50:42.900 --> 50:43.900
Why?

50:43.900 --> 50:44.900
Why?

50:44.900 --> 50:46.900
Why?

51:46.900 --> 51:47.900
Why?

51:47.900 --> 51:48.900
Why?

51:48.900 --> 51:49.900
Why?

51:49.900 --> 51:50.900
Why?

51:50.900 --> 51:51.900
Why?

51:51.900 --> 51:52.900
Why?

51:52.900 --> 51:53.900
Why?

51:53.900 --> 52:03.900
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.

52:23.900 --> 52:28.400
That's why the Orange Lounge, this media sucks!

52:28.400 --> 52:28.900
Holler!

52:28.900 --> 52:29.400
Stop!

52:29.400 --> 52:29.900
Stop!

52:29.900 --> 52:30.400
Stop!

52:30.400 --> 52:30.900
Stop!

52:30.900 --> 52:31.900
You are the winner!

52:31.900 --> 52:33.900
Exercise PS!

52:33.900 --> 52:36.400
GTPO.

52:36.400 --> 52:38.400
Whee!

52:38.400 --> 52:42.400
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

52:42.400 --> 52:44.400
Whee!

52:44.400 --> 52:46.400
Hope you enjoyed that break of four style music.

52:46.400 --> 52:52.400
Starting it off with Taku, Empathy, LED, Infinite Prayer, the floating flock style.

52:52.400 --> 52:56.400
believe that was technically a home version track but who cares it's still

52:56.400 --> 53:02.800
cool DJ Taka featuring Jasmine Final Countdown and Ryu with Starmine and

53:02.800 --> 53:06.560
Ryu one of those interesting guys because he like had that song in fourth

53:06.560 --> 53:10.400
style then disappeared for a long ass time and then came back and I don't

53:10.400 --> 53:13.780
remember if it was ninth or tenth but he did he disappeared for a while then just

53:13.780 --> 53:17.280
recently came back to the series so hope you enjoyed that stuff from fourth style

53:17.280 --> 53:24.880
And, and yes, 2DX Night Style is on people's minds right now because we're actually hearing,

53:24.880 --> 53:30.440
as of today, that some folks have already gotten their copies of 2DX Night Style, the

53:30.440 --> 53:35.860
home release. So, some of you guys may already be having that version. If not, you're gonna

53:35.860 --> 53:40.840
be getting it very soon. The anticipated release date was the, I believe it was the 23rd, was

53:40.840 --> 53:44.460
the anticipated release date, but it looks like it may actually have hit the internet

53:44.460 --> 53:49.540
A wee bit early, so hopefully some of you guys out there may already have been seeing

53:49.540 --> 53:52.900
it. If you haven't though, you're going to be getting that very soon. I know I need to

53:52.900 --> 53:58.020
get my copy still, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm poor, so I won't be getting it

53:58.020 --> 54:03.460
for a little while. But hopefully soon. Darksecker, I know you usually pick up a lot of the new

54:03.460 --> 54:07.540
2DX styles as they come out. Are you getting this one, or? I know you're not. Yeah, I just

54:07.540 --> 54:11.020
didn't pre-order it. Yeah, I know you're not huge on 9th style, so I don't know if you

54:11.020 --> 54:15.020
maybe passed on it or what? I honestly didn't care about ninth style, but I'm

54:15.020 --> 54:20.280
gonna get it. Just to be a perfectionist, right? Or a completionist, I should say.

54:20.280 --> 54:23.740
Yeah, but I'm still missing fourth style. Well, I guess that's true. But fourth style's a

54:23.740 --> 54:28.780
little harder to find. Not really. Really? I thought it was. I can find it. Oh, rad. I just

54:28.780 --> 54:32.580
haven't spent the money on it. But fourth style's gonna be on the back burner

54:32.580 --> 54:38.780
because I have to get Vibrable. Oh. Cool. And I still need to find Moji

54:38.780 --> 54:45.620
ribbon but that one's been kind of out hmm let's see four style songs that are

54:45.620 --> 54:49.440
coming back into night style there's a lot of repeats if you check out the

54:49.440 --> 54:55.720
official night style consumer version website konami studio co dot JP slash bm

54:55.720 --> 55:04.080
to the number two DX nine th that's konami studio co dot JP slash bm to dx

55:04.080 --> 55:09.840
9th. It actually has a whole big song list, so some of the songs coming back from 4th

55:09.840 --> 55:15.920
Style, just some of them, the ones I recognize, Empathy, of course, Kamikaze is coming back.

55:15.920 --> 55:20.360
This one is interesting, I think, from 3rd Style, Dong Tepo No. 1, remember that one?

55:20.360 --> 55:27.360
I hate that song. That song is hilarious. And Macho Gang by Anal Spider is coming back.

55:27.360 --> 55:33.040
I love the hamburger helper video that goes along with that.

55:33.040 --> 55:37.620
Some very interesting consumer tracks making their way into the Night Style home

55:37.620 --> 55:39.940
version. A couple LED tracks including

55:39.940 --> 55:44.660
Jaeger Final Attack and another song called Photo and Genic.

55:44.660 --> 55:49.480
And an LED usually teams up with Groovy but actually Groovy has their own

55:49.480 --> 55:53.140
song featuring Nopla's chin. 5 p.m. Eternal

55:53.140 --> 55:58.640
is a song that they have in the night style. So again, for the full list, you can head on over there.

55:58.640 --> 56:02.380
All the brand new night style songs are making their way to the home version.

56:02.380 --> 56:06.740
I believe they stopped doing the license thing with night style. At least I haven't

56:06.740 --> 56:08.100
noticed anything missing.

56:08.100 --> 56:11.580
If there was something missing, then I just didn't notice it.

56:11.580 --> 56:14.860
My only concern is that Bad Boy Bass made it in.

56:14.860 --> 56:20.580
And Bad Boy Bass did make it in, so that was my only concern, because it's my

56:20.580 --> 56:21.660
favorite night style song.

56:21.660 --> 56:35.660
So, and then of course I'm sure Lion Ski, for those of you guys that are into Kiriyamaoka and who can blame ya, I'm sure that song also is making its debut along with the video in 9th Style, so good times there for 2DX 9th Style.

56:35.660 --> 56:39.660
Angel, I know you're really into 2DX as well, what are your thoughts on the 9th Style release this week?

56:39.660 --> 56:54.660
I want it, but I need to get 8th first, so I'm a little behind. Okay, I'm a lot, well, I'm not that behind. I just need 8th and 9th now, so, you know. Plus, I need to practice more too.

56:54.660 --> 56:57.660
Practice makes perfect.

56:57.660 --> 57:01.660
Uh, Loki, I know you hate 2DX, but any interest in this whatsoever?

57:03.660 --> 57:04.660
Uh, mic's not on, bud.

57:05.660 --> 57:07.660
I don't hate 2DX, but uh...

57:10.660 --> 57:12.660
Someone's breaking the mic!

57:12.660 --> 57:13.660
Sounds fine.

57:14.660 --> 57:16.660
I know that, but there's pieces of metal jutting out.

57:16.660 --> 57:17.660
Oh, yuck.

57:17.660 --> 57:19.660
And uh, the top part's coming off.

57:19.660 --> 57:20.660
Uh oh.

57:21.660 --> 57:22.660
Hurray! Anyway.

57:22.660 --> 57:39.660
Anyway, my thoughts. It's another game. Yay. Yeah. Hooray. Another 2DX game. And how have they made it any better? Nope, they haven't.

57:39.660 --> 57:46.660
I just want to know about the timing. I want to get some feedback on how the timing is in 9th style, and unfortunately I haven't had the time today to read the message boards.

57:46.660 --> 57:52.660
I'm hoping that when we open up the Skype line later, maybe some folks might already know about if the timing got better from the arcade.

57:52.660 --> 58:03.660
Um, I actually, I want to say we did have somebody was saying, I think it was Siggy or somebody on the Skype line a couple weeks back was saying that the timing is somewhat better, which I hope, I hope is true.

58:03.660 --> 58:10.660
is true. Anyway, so that's it for night style. I really don't have a whole lot else to add

58:11.260 --> 58:17.060
to that. So, anybody else have any exciting night style related news?

58:17.060 --> 58:21.760
I kind of want the deluxe set. What is coming in? I don't even remember

58:21.760 --> 58:27.180
what's coming in. It's got a DVD, the v-rare 10, and a sticker

58:27.180 --> 58:35.460
Book. When I saw Sticker Book, I was like, I don't want stickers. I almost bought the

58:35.460 --> 58:42.380
Pop Music 9, the deluxe set. Ooh, that was pretty cool. I wanted a teacup. But I ended

58:42.380 --> 58:47.980
up buying Right Chance instead. You know another song that shows up in Nightstyle Consumer

58:47.980 --> 58:54.580
is Number 13 by Taka with Respect for JSB, and that would be one of them preview tracks

58:54.580 --> 58:59.620
from a future 2DX style, so that's kinda cool. I'm kinda glad that, um, that, you know, is

58:59.620 --> 59:02.780
showing up. I like seeing preview songs. I'm just glad we're getting more 2DX, but now

59:02.780 --> 59:06.500
they need to, uh, start bringing out the, uh, guitar dora. It's weird that they've all

59:06.500 --> 59:10.300
been coming out, like, back to back. Like, we went years with no 2DX at home and then

59:10.300 --> 59:15.140
suddenly, bam, seventh, eighth, now ninth. Oops, we fucked up! And you know that if this

59:15.140 --> 59:18.340
does well, which I assume it will, because it's got a pretty big following here in the

59:18.340 --> 59:24.620
States 10th will be out probably by the end of summer which is rock because 10th

59:24.620 --> 59:29.420
style is pretty cool too I have to have my Gradius remember back in the day when

59:29.420 --> 59:34.980
they're like we don't make you seven style unless you vote and if you buy or

59:34.980 --> 59:38.780
else we don't make yes I remember that that they were saying I know they're

59:38.780 --> 59:45.860
like oh you like you fight again we make more for you thank you thank you for

59:45.860 --> 59:55.740
that. You can address those cards and letters to matt at orangelandradio.com, by the way.

59:55.740 --> 59:59.580
You know, I just, I kind of hope that they're still going to come out in the arcade as well,

59:59.580 --> 01:00:04.300
like 2DX Red. I still haven't gotten a chance to play Red, but I'm kind of hoping to when

01:00:04.300 --> 01:00:08.920
I get to go down to LA in a couple of weeks. So, we'll see. And then, hopefully, that'll

01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:12.700
be out for home by early next year. So, at the rate things are going, that would be pretty

01:00:12.700 --> 01:00:24.700
Cool. I don't know. Do you think there's any room for 2DX to evolve in the near future or be, I guess I should say, maybe not necessarily 2DX, but Beatmania? Even though Beatmania, the five-

01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.700
50 key.

01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:32.700
Been there, done that. Keyboardmania doubles. Hello.

01:00:32.700 --> 01:00:34.700
They can come with an ice cream dispenser.

01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700
Typing of the beat.

01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:38.700
They did that. Remember that?

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.700
Beatmania, dah, dah, dah.

01:00:40.700 --> 01:00:42.700
Duh duh duh.

01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:46.700
Exactly. Dot dot dot is all I heard. I heard it was total crap too.

01:00:46.700 --> 01:00:49.700
I like that loopin' typing game.

01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:52.700
I don't play that. I have typing of the dead at home.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:57.700
I'm sad that there was not any more keyboard manias that came out.

01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.700
Speaking of 50 key.

01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.700
I like keyboard manias.

01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:03.700
Whatever happened to Para Para? Or Dance Maniacs for that matter.

01:01:03.700 --> 01:01:06.700
Because the Para Para craze has died down in Japan.

01:01:07.700 --> 01:01:11.700
Yeah, I heard rumors that Velfire just ain't what it used to be.

01:01:11.700 --> 01:01:18.700
Well, Velfire was a club, just a regular club anyway, that had, as far as I'm aware, just did pada-pada on certain nights.

01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:19.700
Right.

01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:22.700
I don't have anything to add to that.

01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.700
I'm so going to go there.

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:31.700
I wish that, I think it would be hilarious that if like in San Francisco or something there was actually a bar where they did that as well, I just think that would be hilarious.

01:01:31.700 --> 01:01:35.700
I mean, if people can fucking country line dance, why can't they, pa-ra-pa? Seriously?

01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:37.700
You look just as stupid doing either one.

01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:39.700
Maybe it's just me?

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:42.700
Patapata, though, is kinda cool. It's like cheerleading, though.

01:01:43.700 --> 01:01:44.700
Kind of.

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:49.700
It's all happy! And not boot scootin'.

01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:55.700
Like, I go to karaoke and some lesbian will get up there and start singing a country song, like, you know,

01:01:55.700 --> 01:01:58.700
Don't break my heart, Mike. No, I'm just kidding. Nobody sings that.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:01:59.700
But, like, they'll sing Dixie Chicks or something.

01:01:59.700 --> 01:02:03.700
And people start country line dancing, and I'm like, that's so weird.

01:02:03.700 --> 01:02:07.700
I don't know why. I shouldn't hate, but it's weird.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:11.700
There's the straights! Get him!

01:02:11.700 --> 01:02:15.700
And it makes perfect sense. Gay people

01:02:15.700 --> 01:02:19.700
don't line dance. It's documented in books.

01:02:19.700 --> 01:02:23.700
In their natural habitat?

01:02:23.700 --> 01:02:27.700
Yes.

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:31.700
Oh, Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom is so winter. Square Dance Revolution. I would love to see that game.

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:37.340
that game. No, I did square dancing in fourth grade and it sucked. Everybody, didn't everybody

01:02:37.340 --> 01:02:41.420
do square dancing in high school? Like in December when it started raining you would

01:02:41.420 --> 01:02:47.380
have to do square dancing for two weeks? Believe it or not, not in Alabama. Really? Now that's

01:02:47.380 --> 01:02:51.340
surprising. I would think that square dancing would be like a whole class in Alabama that

01:02:51.340 --> 01:02:58.340
you could take for units. Just teasing. I know. You know what you can do with that finger.

01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:00.340
I have plenty of ideas.

01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.340
Pleasure a sheep?

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.340
Hit him please.

01:03:08.340 --> 01:03:10.340
Cause I can't.

01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.340
That's solid metal.

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.340
That's the idea.

01:03:16.340 --> 01:03:18.340
Oh, it's hot.

01:03:18.340 --> 01:03:20.340
Alright.

01:03:20.340 --> 01:03:22.340
Anyway.

01:03:22.340 --> 01:03:26.340
Let's talk about other Vivani news going on out there right now.

01:03:26.340 --> 01:03:31.660
this is pretty big deal than making the rounds of all the sites. All the big dinner sites

01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:35.180
have this news going on right now because of course they get a little kick back if you

01:03:35.180 --> 01:03:42.700
answer this call. In the Groove is officially taking pre-orders while the game does not

01:03:42.700 --> 01:03:49.740
have an official release date yet, they're saying summer 2005 quote unquote. There is

01:03:49.740 --> 01:03:57.980
pre-order bonus that you can get an in the groove soundtrack an in the groove

01:03:57.980 --> 01:04:05.100
t-shirt red octane temporary tattoo so you can be cool you put on that name put

01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:09.660
on that red octane tattoo and go to the Harley Davidson bar and show how cool

01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:16.980
you are a red octane keychain you know this this is like crap that they made

01:04:16.980 --> 01:04:20.900
that they tried to give away at conventions, and it couldn't go anywhere, and they're like,

01:04:20.900 --> 01:04:24.820
what are we gonna do with all this crap? I know, let's give it away, woo!

01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:31.940
And free shipping. And of course, as expected, there will be an In the Groove bundle,

01:04:31.940 --> 01:04:35.940
which will be the game and an ignition pad. Will it be as glitchy as the arcade?

01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:39.380
I'm not sure. Is that one of the features?

01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:44.020
I'm not sure. You know what I figured out about In the Groove for the first time when I was playing

01:04:44.020 --> 01:04:48.140
if you actually sit and you watch the Attract Mode

01:04:48.140 --> 01:04:51.700
it actually shows pictures of all the people who made the game

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:55.340
and then pictures of all these people gathered up in the arcade

01:04:55.340 --> 01:04:59.160
Like I saw AID on the break in there and I was like, oh I

01:04:59.160 --> 01:04:59.960
played that machine, that's kinda neat

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.420
it was kinda neat in a way, but at the same time I was kinda like

01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:07.440
WOW, these guys credit themselves as step chart makers

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:10.860
they credit themselves in the credits of the game

01:05:10.860 --> 01:05:13.820
They credit themselves in the opening sequence of the game.

01:05:13.820 --> 01:05:18.140
Not that, okay, not that, you know, you shouldn't get a little credit because

01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.140
these games take a lot of work, but

01:05:20.140 --> 01:05:24.620
I don't know, it seems like most other games I've played have

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:28.820
a little bit of a, a little bit of a hold warm

01:05:28.820 --> 01:05:31.860
when it comes to that stuff. A little less, not so much.

01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:37.180
I don't know. Not, I don't, I don't, I'm gonna get the hate mail.

01:05:37.180 --> 01:05:41.180
I'm not dogging on In The Group. I'm actually starting to warm up to the game a little bit.

01:05:41.180 --> 01:05:45.180
I'm finding like the five songs I really like to play over and over again.

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:49.180
So, you know, I'm having a good time. And my scores are getting better.

01:05:49.180 --> 01:05:53.180
I'm getting used to that wacky scrolling thing, the way it scrolls initially.

01:05:53.180 --> 01:05:56.180
Angel, you had to play In The Group for the first time this week. What did you think?

01:05:56.180 --> 01:06:00.180
I suck. I suck bad. I don't know.

01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:04.180
I find the arrows like really small for, you know,

01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:10.740
the way, because I can't see that well and just you know having small arrows kind of makes it hard

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:17.460
so I had to follow by color which doesn't exactly work but um I figure with practice I will

01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:25.300
try to get better at the game assuming we get to go again so other than that I mean

01:06:25.300 --> 01:06:28.980
you know I didn't know any of the music or anything so that didn't help and you know Rob

01:06:28.980 --> 01:06:33.220
was like pick a song pick a song I'm like I don't know what I want to play just pick one

01:06:33.220 --> 01:06:34.540
you know, so

01:06:34.540 --> 01:06:37.260
I guess uh...

01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:41.960
as I play the game I'll get to know the songs and I'll feel a little bit more comfortable with it

01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:43.340
but other than that, yeah

01:06:43.340 --> 01:06:45.140
it's okay

01:06:45.140 --> 01:06:49.020
it's still a rip-off, but it's still okay

01:06:49.020 --> 01:06:53.300
uh, Andrew, you got to play it for the first time as well, what were your thoughts on Indigo Groove?

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:54.980
I thought it was uh... pretty well done

01:06:54.980 --> 01:06:56.940
uh...

01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.180
did seem a little bit glitchy

01:06:59.180 --> 01:07:00.620
but

01:07:00.620 --> 01:07:06.060
Actually it plays like a finished product. Now glitchy is a very vague word. What do you mean with glitchy?

01:07:06.060 --> 01:07:09.340
Just some basic timing stuff

01:07:09.340 --> 01:07:12.580
because I was listening to the songs and just some

01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:16.220
steps just didn't match. So it mostly could be just a step chart problem.

01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:20.860
Well now that's a step chart glitch. Could be just step charts to me but

01:07:20.860 --> 01:07:25.860
it actually plays like a finished product.

01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:28.740
But then I went back and I played DDR and you know what's weird?

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:33.180
The DDR machine is only about half as loud as the In The Groove machine.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:36.740
The two machines are right next to each other. I got on DDR and I played

01:07:36.740 --> 01:07:39.780
and I got like a huge crowd watching me play DDR.

01:07:39.780 --> 01:07:42.780
In The Groove, maybe a couple people, but DDR...

01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:45.220
It doesn't have the same appeal, it doesn't have the name recognition.

01:07:45.220 --> 01:07:49.220
Not that I'm like huge, but I always thought to the standard

01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:54.140
just patron of an arcade, a teenager, they're all the same.

01:07:54.140 --> 01:07:57.860
You know, that's always why. Maybe I'm not giving the average user of the arcade enough

01:07:57.860 --> 01:07:58.480
credit,

01:07:58.480 --> 01:08:01.660
but I always thought every dance game was the same to most people that aren't in

01:08:01.660 --> 01:08:02.340
this scene

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:08.220
but I you will be yours here's what I've always said one leg up the DER house on

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:08.820
in the group

01:08:08.820 --> 01:08:11.840
does in the group have more challenging steps yes does it have a

01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:15.460
very song list for folks that may be into them

01:08:15.460 --> 01:08:20.260
will music in the group offers yes does it have more features than the ER yes

01:08:20.260 --> 01:08:23.340
but it's not quite as pretty

01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:28.460
it's very industrial looking the game has a very like industrial theme to

01:08:28.460 --> 01:08:34.780
to it, a lot of like metal and fire and all that stuff. Whereas DDR is happy! It's candy!

01:08:34.780 --> 01:08:41.300
It's saccharin! And I don't know, I think that attracts people to it more. In a completely

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:45.380
superficial way. It brings people out of the dark shadows that are with their lives. Another

01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:51.940
thing is, it looked very plain. Very plain. I mean, just even the arrows are plain. The

01:08:51.940 --> 01:08:57.220
interface is plain. It's just plain. I mean, whereas you can get some interfaces, like

01:08:57.220 --> 01:09:03.220
Like, a lot of the step mania skins I've seen out there, they're really cool looking, and they're really, you know, complex looking.

01:09:03.220 --> 01:09:07.220
They're really, you know, like, wow, I gotta play that game, it looks cool.

01:09:07.220 --> 01:09:13.220
Versus, wow, it's another dancing game, yay.

01:09:13.220 --> 01:09:22.220
Wow, we gotta include all this crap to get you to buy this game, because we're gonna fail when it comes to selling against, you know, DDR.

01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:24.940
people are going to buy this game because they'll be like, oh, I got to put it in the

01:09:24.940 --> 01:09:32.700
group so they make more games. It's just, no. It's, whatever. I'm very curious to see

01:09:32.700 --> 01:09:38.380
how it plays. I'm curious to see how it plays out, too, because I think it is going to be

01:09:38.380 --> 01:09:42.820
competition. We got into this a couple weeks ago. I don't want to revisit, but I think

01:09:42.820 --> 01:09:47.100
the Red Octane partnership is going to prove it's going to make In the Groove some serious

01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.620
competition. I really do. And I think the game is good enough, certainly, where it can

01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:56.160
post a cut it's not like we're talking it's mad cats dance craze or whatever

01:09:56.160 --> 01:10:00.960
that fucking game was on GameCube that sucks it's it's a good dance game does

01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:09.160
it have flaws yeah but is it good is it solid surprisingly so so we'll see we

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:16.160
shall see okay well I'm getting blink blink blinks I don't know what I guess

01:10:16.160 --> 01:10:20.160
we'll do a break time then we'll come back maybe do some skype line how's that

01:10:20.160 --> 01:10:24.160
sound. Let our listeners talk back. Good work. Alright, we'll do that. So we're gonna go

Okay, forget Blue Impulse, then. We'll do this.

01:11:11.600 --> 01:11:13.600
Let them move.

01:11:13.600 --> 01:11:15.600
No, except let them move, because that song's been banned.

01:11:15.600 --> 01:11:16.600
Alright.

01:11:16.600 --> 01:11:18.600
Bye, baby, Blue Balloon.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:20.600
I think that song's been banned, too.

01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:21.600
Yeah, banned.

01:11:21.600 --> 01:11:23.600
So we're gonna do a break of songs we hate?

01:11:23.600 --> 01:11:24.600
Yeah.

01:11:24.600 --> 01:11:25.600
Okay.

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:27.600
Um...

01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:29.600
You gotta give me a minute to queue these up.

01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:30.600
Okay, so what song are we starting off with?

01:11:30.600 --> 01:11:31.600
Come on.

01:11:31.600 --> 01:11:32.600
Sorry.

01:11:32.600 --> 01:11:33.600
Bag.

01:11:33.600 --> 01:11:35.600
I finished the bag of gummy bears.

01:11:35.600 --> 01:11:36.600
Did you now?

01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:38.600
It's gone. I gotta get more.

01:11:38.600 --> 01:11:40.600
How long did that take, a month?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:43.600
Not even, like a couple, like a week or so.

01:11:43.600 --> 01:11:44.600
Two weeks, in fact.

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:45.600
Two weeks.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:46.600
I only have-

01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:47.600
How do you impress them?

01:11:47.600 --> 01:11:48.600
Two weeks!

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.600
Strangely enough, I only have bag from the nonstop.

01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:53.600
You know what's really scary?

01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:54.600
I guess we'll do it.

01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:55.600
What?

01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:57.600
They played Junior today on sci-fi.

01:11:57.600 --> 01:11:58.600
Oh, anyway.

01:11:58.600 --> 01:12:01.600
We'll be back after this, a break of Ditter Songs We Hate.

01:12:01.600 --> 01:12:02.600
We'll be back.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:09.600
back.

01:13:02.600 --> 01:13:24.240
Sweatin' hub, just waitin' out for Sweatin'

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:31.240
Okay, challenging move.

01:13:54.240 --> 01:13:57.240
Get to the bed, to the bed, get to the fever

01:13:58.240 --> 01:14:00.240
I'm kickin' the posers and nobody's home

01:14:01.240 --> 01:14:04.240
When I come I'm runnin' down to town, runnin' down to town

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.240
Get right down to a ship

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.240
In one, two, three, four, come on y'all

01:14:12.240 --> 01:14:13.240
I get on with more

01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:15.240
Get right down, get right down to a ship

01:14:16.240 --> 01:14:18.240
Round and round, move like a finger

01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:22.240
Come down to a sweet banana, get to the fever

01:14:52.240 --> 01:15:18.360
Blow my whistle, baby Blow my whistle, baby

01:15:18.360 --> 01:15:27.360
Open up, put it in, let's begin

01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:42.360
So it's like you mean it's lost

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:56.360
Black, black, let me hear you speak

01:15:56.360 --> 01:16:10.360
Louder, let me hear you say Louder, is that what you call loud?

01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.360
Come on, let me hear you say Let me hear you say

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:25.360
Louder, I said louder You need to bring the beat back

01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:29.520
The

01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:33.520
the

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:37.520
the

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:41.520
the

01:17:41.520 --> 01:17:45.520
the

01:17:45.520 --> 01:17:49.520
the

01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:53.520
the

01:17:53.520 --> 01:18:18.840
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:19.840
Nooooooo!

01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:22.200
Just kidding.

01:18:22.200 --> 01:18:26.920
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

01:18:26.920 --> 01:18:30.160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:33.800
OK, now I told you that, at least I told the chat room,

01:18:33.800 --> 01:18:37.200
that we would have a good reason for why we hate all those songs.

01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:40.080
Because a lot of people are like, I like this song.

01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.600
I like that song.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.160
You guys are mean.

01:18:43.160 --> 01:18:45.400
You said it was going to be a bad music break.

01:18:45.400 --> 01:18:46.520
Bad, bad, bad.

01:18:46.520 --> 01:18:48.360
Pretty bad to me.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:56.760
Okay, reason number one for bag. Why I hate bag. Bag is a horde song. People play bag

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:01.740
to death because it's a ten footer and they'll play it on three speed and then when they

01:19:01.740 --> 01:19:06.760
pass it they're like, oh my god, I passed a ten footer. And also because of the way

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:11.620
the song sounds, it's one of those songs you can hear from across the arcade when somebody's

01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:18.240
play it and it's like oh god somebody's trying to get it you know pass a 10

01:19:18.240 --> 01:19:22.400
footer over there even real bagpipe music when you're standing next to the

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:28.600
pipest yes the Piper sorry does not sound as annoying I love bagpipe music

01:19:28.600 --> 01:19:32.880
not when I'm standing right next to the Piper because then it's deafening mm-hmm

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:37.040
but I would rather go deaf from listening to real bagpipes now the weird

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:42.140
Another thing about Bag, I actually really like it in 2DX, so I can't explain that one

01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:45.880
at all, because I actually really like playing that song on 2DX, so that means, you know,

01:19:45.880 --> 01:19:48.960
I'm gonna get to play it with 9 style and everything, but I don't like that song in

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:53.880
DDR at all. Maybe it's because it's not as horrid in 2DX? I don't know, I can't explain

01:19:53.880 --> 01:19:57.680
it, because it's an easy 2DX song, I guess? I think it was, I think it was like a 6, I

01:19:57.680 --> 01:20:05.480
don't remember. What else? Changma, Love This Feelin'. Okay, that song's actually not that

01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:10.120
bad. I mean, it's one of those songs I used to hate a long time ago, but I know I warmed

01:20:10.120 --> 01:20:12.640
up to it. And Jamie, you were saying, you think that song is okay too?

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:17.760
I used to play that song when the only DDR I had was 2nd Mix on Dreamcast. I used to

01:20:17.760 --> 01:20:21.240
play that song for the sole purpose of irritating the shit out of people, and then I started

01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:25.400
to really like it. Here's the thing about that song. As far as

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:30.280
I know, and correct me if I'm wrong on this statement, I'm sure the chat room will, but

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:36.680
But I believe it was the first DDR song that had a tempo change.

01:20:36.680 --> 01:20:40.960
And now, tempo changes are really horrid in DDR.

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.640
Like I was playing UltraMix 2 online today, I was playing some Controller Controller Revolution,

01:20:45.640 --> 01:20:51.120
but just to cover my ass here, I specifically looked for a room on UltraMix that said Controller

01:20:51.120 --> 01:20:57.240
Fun so that we would be playing with controller people so I wouldn't be playing with pad people.

01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.880
And I just realized, my god, there's a ton of songs with tempo changes now, like it is

01:21:01.880 --> 01:21:03.960
such a horrid thing now.

01:21:03.960 --> 01:21:09.360
So for that, I don't know why, but I blame Love This Feelin' for all my tempo change

01:21:09.360 --> 01:21:10.360
woes.

01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.760
Don't get me wrong, tempo changes can be good once in a while, but they're kinda horrid

01:21:14.760 --> 01:21:15.760
lately.

01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:20.720
Uh, DJ Alligator Project, the Whistle Song.

01:21:20.720 --> 01:21:23.040
I hate that song so much.

01:21:23.040 --> 01:21:25.760
Again, it's just Hoard.

01:21:25.760 --> 01:21:29.300
And the song is Blow My Whistle, Bitch.

01:21:29.300 --> 01:21:32.620
And I don't like the fact that they censored it in the actual song.

01:21:32.620 --> 01:21:34.160
They didn't censor the background.

01:21:34.160 --> 01:21:36.800
It still says Blow My Whistle, Bitch, but they censored the song.

01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:42.000
Actually, they have both versions on his album, because I have his album.

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:43.000
The vinyl.

01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:45.620
Oh my god, why?

01:21:45.620 --> 01:21:47.240
Because I was collecting DDR music.

01:21:47.240 --> 01:21:48.240
Alright, whatever.

01:21:48.240 --> 01:21:50.900
I suppose I can play that slide.

01:21:50.900 --> 01:21:51.980
But that's another one of those songs.

01:21:51.980 --> 01:21:56.100
you can hear it from across the arcade and I swear to god you could be sitting over on

01:21:56.100 --> 01:22:06.100
like Derby Owners Club or something you can hear it's like oh god somebody shot off the

01:22:06.100 --> 01:22:15.480
machine now what the only thing would be fun to play like bag two that's final furlong

01:22:15.480 --> 01:22:25.520
And then we played Max 300, because that song is so, so horrid. And not just the song itself

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:30.600
when it's played, but all the remixes of Max 300. Because of all the crappy remixes out

01:22:30.600 --> 01:22:33.840
there of Max 300, we are dubbing Max 300 a bad song.

01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:36.720
What about Max Period? That one?

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:41.000
Yeah. Oh, God, we should have played that one, too. We could have just done a break

01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000
of Max music and probably had, you know?

01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:55.400
think I would have like exploded nevermind all right as promised we are

01:22:55.400 --> 01:22:58.600
going to open up the skype line for those of you guys that want to give a

01:22:58.600 --> 01:23:02.200

Just woke up, as usual.

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:54.340
Good morning.

01:23:54.340 --> 01:23:56.100
So, you must be pretty excited about the ninth style coming out this week.

01:23:56.100 --> 01:23:57.380
Oh, hell yes.

01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:59.020
And the early release news?

01:23:59.020 --> 01:24:00.020
That's pretty exciting.

01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:05.700
Well, according to Play Asia, they released it by today in Hong Kong.

01:24:05.700 --> 01:24:06.880
Oh.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:07.880
Very interesting.

01:24:07.880 --> 01:24:08.880
Okay.

01:24:08.880 --> 01:24:11.880
The release date is March 21st, which is tomorrow.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:19.880
But before I get into the 9th style business, I just want to say some local news here in Vegas.

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:25.880
Sure, we appreciate local news, because we talk about Sacramento way too much on this show, so we need to hear from other communities.

01:24:25.880 --> 01:24:26.880
So what's up in Vegas?

01:24:26.880 --> 01:24:29.880
Yeah, um, how should I say it?

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:33.880
Circus Circus Adventure Jones is going to get 2DX Red by tomorrow.

01:24:33.880 --> 01:24:52.880
Oh, my, that's very interesting. Now, I usually stay at Circus Circus when I go to Vegas, because it's fucking cheap, and so I've been to the Adventure Dome, um, God, I think that was one of the first place, actually the first place I ever played DDR was Circus Circus, but it wasn't in the Adventure Dome, it was in the arcade they had there.

01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:53.880
Midway.

01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:58.880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Midway area. Huh, so they're getting 2DX Red, huh?

01:24:58.880 --> 01:24:59.880
Yep.

01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:04.880
And the Adventure Dome, that's so weird to me. What caused them to decide to jump there?

01:25:04.880 --> 01:25:06.880
Have they been successful with 8 style?

01:25:06.880 --> 01:25:11.880
Well, it's probably the locals. The locals have been demanding it.

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:15.880
Hmm. Interesting. We'll have to let us know how that goes.

01:25:15.880 --> 01:25:18.880
Yeah, sure thing. I'll take pictures.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.880
Woo hoo! Anything else to share with Vegas scene?

01:25:21.880 --> 01:25:23.880
Oh, that's only about it.

01:25:23.880 --> 01:25:31.880
There's already some news about getting In The Groove here in Vegas. I don't know which arcade.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:39.880
Hmm. Well, you know with In The Groove 2 coming out just around the corner, maybe you guys ought to hold off at this point. Who knows?

01:25:39.880 --> 01:25:41.880
I'm not an In The Groove person, so...

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:45.880
Yeah, I know. I know how it is. I feel your pain.

01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:47.880
Yeah, let's get into night style.

01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:48.880
Alright, let's.

01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:56.880
I'm gonna post a link to a website that has pictures of night style in it.

01:25:56.880 --> 01:26:01.880
Ooh, alright, so you can read that in our chat room, www.orangestonesradio.com, click on chat.

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.880
There's the link, I just saw it pop up.

01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:11.880
What's interesting about night style CS is, you know, the main menu is actually mode select.

01:26:11.880 --> 01:26:13.880
You know, the arcade mode select.

01:26:13.880 --> 01:26:16.880
Hold on, I'm trying to bring it up myself over here right now.

01:26:16.880 --> 01:26:20.880
Oh, oh, this is weird because all the pictures are on its side.

01:26:20.880 --> 01:26:23.880
Yeah, you're gonna head tilt, tilt your head.

01:26:23.880 --> 01:26:24.880
I'm gonna tilt my monitor here.

01:26:24.880 --> 01:26:27.880
Alright, so the main select screen is, uh...

01:26:27.880 --> 01:26:28.880
Mode select.

01:26:28.880 --> 01:26:29.880
Mode select, that's kind of weird.

01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:33.880
Alright, uh, here's the actual picture of it.

01:26:33.880 --> 01:26:37.880
Let me, uh, paste it to...

01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:38.880
Oh, here it is.

01:26:38.880 --> 01:26:41.880
Okay.

01:26:41.880 --> 01:26:46.880
Got it.

01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:49.880
That's the main screen, huh, when you turn on the game?

01:26:49.880 --> 01:26:51.880
Oh, wow.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:54.880
Okay, so the main menu screen has various options on it.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.880
Free, training, original, gallery.

01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:59.880
Kind of what you're used to seeing, but the way it's set up,

01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:02.880
it almost looks like you're just jumping right into the game.

01:27:02.880 --> 01:27:04.880
There's really no, you know, fancy...

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:08.880
Like, I don't know, like, sixth-style kind of had its own fancy menu.

01:27:08.880 --> 01:27:10.880
Wow, that sounds rushed.

01:27:10.880 --> 01:27:13.880
Well, at least we're getting it. I mean, I can't complain.

01:27:13.880 --> 01:27:17.880
Well, at least we're getting it. Oh, at least that car has three of its wheels!

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880
Shut up.

01:27:19.880 --> 01:27:21.880
Alright, so that's interesting.

01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:27.880
Yeah. And, uh, on the music list on the official Nine Style CS website, on the very bottom, it says that

01:27:27.880 --> 01:27:35.880
Number 13, uh, Beyond the Earth and, uh, Sakuretsu, Jega, Denko, Chup, or Jega Final Attack

01:27:35.880 --> 01:27:37.880
are three unlovable stars.

01:27:37.880 --> 01:27:39.880
You're like me.

01:27:39.880 --> 01:27:50.880
Okay, that's cool. I like, I was surprised by the number 13. I guess I'd heard the thing, I think you had mentioned a couple weeks ago, but you know, to see that officially, that was pretty neat.

01:27:50.880 --> 01:27:51.880
Mm-hmm.

01:27:51.880 --> 01:27:57.880
So, and then I'm interested to hear the new Jaeger. Have the MP3s leaked to the internet yet?

01:27:57.880 --> 01:27:58.880
Uh, nope.

01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:00.880
It's only a matter of time, my friend.

01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:03.880
Yeah, probably within this week or next week.

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:07.880
Yeah, it's only a matter of time. I'm sure Bamani's style will have them up and you can spend your tokens.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:17.880
As soon as we can get our grubby little paws on him, we're going to start checking the file shares, because here's the real way to get MP3s before anybody else has them.

01:28:17.880 --> 01:28:22.880
Get on the file shares, like the ones that are popular in Asia, like WinMX and stuff, and sometimes you can find them on there.

01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:28.880
Like, that's how we got 10-style MP3s pretty quick, was file shares. So, just a thought. If our listeners care.

01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:37.880
Yeah, I'm quite happy that some songs that made it, you know, that made a comeback on 9th Style CS, for example, like Empathy.

01:28:37.880 --> 01:28:51.880
I was a little surprised by the comeback list, too. There were some, there were some good things in it, and then there were songs like V, where I'm like, goddamn, do we need V again? I'm done with V, I'm over V.

01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:57.880
Yeah, I never, you know, I never played a Kamikaze before.

01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.920
before oh that's a fun one it's it's got um that's the one isn't that the one

01:29:02.920 --> 01:29:07.520
that slows down suddenly and then like speeds up I remember that was one of the

01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:22.880
first songs I saw in 2dx was that song oh god that song is hot you just wanted

01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:26.440

01:29:48.280 --> 01:29:51.280
Manatsu no Hana, Manatsu no Yume, Baisana, ugh, another song, so...

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:53.280
Ganjutai!

01:29:53.280 --> 01:29:55.280
I'm sorry, I just...

01:29:55.280 --> 01:30:02.280
Take it as a compliment, take it as a compliment that I'm just, I'm doing the blinking thing, I can't understand, I'm sorry.

01:30:02.280 --> 01:30:04.280
Alright.

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:07.280
Well, are you gonna call us next week and let us know what you think about it?

01:30:07.280 --> 01:30:09.280
Alright, yeah, I'll call you next week.

01:30:09.280 --> 01:30:13.280
Alright, do that, cause we're poor, so we have to live vicariously through other folks.

01:30:13.280 --> 01:30:16.280
But I'm hoping Jamie will have it soon and she'll bring it over and let us all play.

01:30:16.280 --> 01:30:21.680
If I get it, I'll have my birthday next month.

01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:22.680
I just said I'm poor.

01:30:22.680 --> 01:30:23.680
Don't be looking at me.

01:30:23.680 --> 01:30:24.680
I wasn't.

01:30:24.680 --> 01:30:25.680
I know.

01:30:25.680 --> 01:30:26.680
I know.

01:30:26.680 --> 01:30:27.680
Alright.

01:30:27.680 --> 01:30:28.680
Okay, well thanks for the call, Siggy.

01:30:28.680 --> 01:30:29.680
I hope you have a good one.

01:30:29.680 --> 01:30:30.680
Yeah.

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:31.680
Alright.

01:30:31.680 --> 01:30:32.680
Later.

01:30:32.680 --> 01:30:34.600
Always good to hear from Siggy.

01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:38.680
I think what we will do since we're running past a little bit after 8 o'clock, what we're

01:30:38.680 --> 01:30:41.320
going to do is we're going to go ahead and shut the Skyplane down for now.

01:30:41.320 --> 01:30:46.120
We will open it back up right after the cage match and take some more calls.

01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.380
first we are going to get into tonight's cage match and remember this is

01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:53.080
something we do every week here on orange launch radio if you want to

01:30:53.080 --> 01:30:57.400
participate in the cage match you've got to be in our chat room otherwise

01:30:57.400 --> 01:31:03.280

01:31:03.280 --> 01:31:07.000
you gotta be in our chat room to vote that's the way it works so let's get

01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:14.620
into it and last week's cage match we had a brand new winner again we've had a

01:31:14.620 --> 01:31:18.780
a couple of one week victories lately. Let's see if this one will win for one week or if

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:25.940
it will hold on. It was a remix of an old school 90's song, What is Love by Haddaway.

01:31:25.940 --> 01:31:33.100
It's What is Love Reloaded. So, we'll see what you guys think about this one. You did

01:31:33.100 --> 01:31:37.020
vote it as your winner last week. You may vote it again tonight or you may not. It's

01:31:37.020 --> 01:31:42.620
up to you guys. As a reminder, we only play a clip of the first song because you got to

01:31:42.620 --> 01:31:46.920
to hear the song in its entirety last week, and we want to let this segment only take

01:31:46.920 --> 01:31:52.560
up a little bit of time. It doesn't have to take up all day. So, anyway, that all being

01:31:52.560 --> 01:31:56.360
said and done, get in our chat room so you can vote. Remember, you cannot vote until

01:31:56.360 --> 01:32:04.780

Why you're not there? I give you my love but you don't care

So what is right and what is wrong? Give me a sign

What is love? Oh baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

Oh baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

01:33:29.180 --> 01:33:31.180
What is love?

01:33:31.180 --> 01:33:33.180
What is love?

01:33:33.180 --> 01:34:02.780
Alright, that was song number one.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:09.140
week's winner, Haddaway! What is love? We shall see if it wins again tonight or if it

01:34:09.140 --> 01:34:15.460
will bow down to one of our two other entries tonight, starting off with Loki's pick! And

01:34:15.460 --> 01:34:18.020
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:28.540
I picked our fellow friend and Bimani artist, Midihead. He released an exclusive track to

01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:31.140
of people that bought his album

01:34:31.140 --> 01:34:33.460
and this is for you guys it's

01:34:33.460 --> 01:34:38.460
white knuckle ride and uh...

01:34:38.460 --> 01:34:40.700
Song number two, Minnie Head, White Knuckle Ride.

01:35:08.460 --> 01:35:13.460
Strap it in, let it slide, take me up to the sky

01:35:13.460 --> 01:35:17.460
See the beer in my heart, beating like I'm gonna die

01:35:17.460 --> 01:35:20.460
It's the rusty wounds inside, I keep shaking and I cannot hide

01:35:20.460 --> 01:35:22.460
Here we are, let's go inside

01:35:22.460 --> 01:35:24.460
On this white knuckle ride

01:35:30.460 --> 01:35:32.460
On this white knuckle ride

01:35:33.460 --> 01:35:35.460
On this white knuckle ride

01:35:35.460 --> 01:35:42.460
Hang on to your home now, now, now, now

01:37:05.460 --> 01:37:07.460
Why is that the whole ride?

01:37:24.740 --> 01:37:26.740
My heart is beating like I'm gonna die

01:37:30.340 --> 01:37:32.340
You're going out, let's go inside

01:37:32.340 --> 01:37:34.340
I'm gonna eat you like I'm gonna die

01:37:39.260 --> 01:37:41.260
I'm gonna eat you like I'm gonna die

01:37:41.260 --> 01:37:48.260
Give me a hand, let him fly My heart is beating like I'm gonna die

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.260
Ha ha ha ha

01:38:04.260 --> 01:38:08.260
Drive me in, let him fly Take me up to the sky

01:38:38.260 --> 01:38:53.260
Hi, I'm here. Sorry. We're having a PictoChat orgy here in the studio. I had to take a break

01:38:53.260 --> 01:38:59.060
from it for a minute. Anyway, that was song number two. Midi Head, White Knuckle Ride.

01:38:59.060 --> 01:39:02.220
What do you guys think? Starting off with Dark Sakura.

01:39:02.220 --> 01:39:04.700
I still hate that man's voice. Sorry.

01:39:04.700 --> 01:39:05.700
But he's so cool.

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:12.260
he's cool don't get me wrong i just don't like his voice i don't think he can sing very well so um

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:19.780
it would have had a 10 but by virtue of voice it gets the name said all right uh

01:39:19.780 --> 01:39:22.180
who's got a mic over there uh magus

01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:33.380
um that's not a steaming pile of poo but it's all right probably gets like seven

01:39:33.380 --> 01:39:35.380
Got a good beat behind it, though.

01:39:37.380 --> 01:39:38.380
Alright, Angel.

01:39:39.380 --> 01:39:40.380
Ow.

01:39:40.380 --> 01:39:42.380
Head rush. Okay, um...

01:39:43.380 --> 01:39:45.380
Eight, because I like mini-heads.

01:39:46.380 --> 01:39:48.380
And stuff. Yeah. Bye.

01:39:49.380 --> 01:39:54.380
Uh, me personally? I actually thought that song was pretty fucking rad. I think that's one of his better tracks.

01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:56.380
I kind of want to keep that one for myself.

01:39:57.380 --> 01:39:58.380
So, I give it a nine and a half.

01:39:59.380 --> 01:40:00.380
Loki.

01:40:00.380 --> 01:40:03.380
There's a microphone being shoved in my face.

01:40:06.380 --> 01:40:08.380
Yeah, that was cool. I liked it. That's why I picked it.

01:40:09.380 --> 01:40:10.380
It gets a 10.

01:40:11.380 --> 01:40:12.380
Alright, sounds good.

01:40:13.380 --> 01:40:19.380
Alright, let's get into song number 3. Song number 3 is Dark Sakura's Pick. What did you pick for us tonight?

01:40:19.380 --> 01:40:31.380
Um, I like Yoko Kanno. She's really cool and she's a neat person in person. She signed our Macross Plus, uh, CD at AX, like, a while back.

01:40:31.380 --> 01:40:40.380
Um, anyway, this is one from, uh, she, uh, sent us on the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell standalone complex. It's, uh, Rise.

01:40:40.380 --> 01:40:45.380
I'm trying to remember who sent it to me because I think it's in the chatroom right now, but I don't remember, so sorry.

01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:51.460
all right yoko kano rise enjoy

01:41:45.380 --> 01:41:50.380
I'm still not there at all

01:41:50.380 --> 01:41:58.380
I'm still not there at all

01:41:58.380 --> 01:42:00.380
I'm still not there at all

01:42:00.380 --> 01:42:04.380
For the day when the pain is far behind

01:42:04.380 --> 01:42:08.380
On your feet I'm missing

01:42:08.380 --> 01:42:11.380
Fear is all that I lack

01:42:11.380 --> 01:42:13.380
I'm still not there at all

01:42:13.380 --> 01:42:18.080
Take your place, please, and follow the judge, please, say

01:42:18.080 --> 01:42:26.180
I'm so free, but only it's time to make this end reside

01:42:26.180 --> 01:42:32.580
Here I go, bye

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:46.580
I'm a soldier from the stand, in this waking hell I am

01:42:46.580 --> 01:42:52.580
Listening more than I can come to you

01:42:52.580 --> 01:42:56.580
Pray myself, please don't forget

01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.580
Life could trade and be a threat

01:42:59.580 --> 01:43:05.580
Please give me the strength to be a fool

01:43:05.580 --> 01:43:12.580
People facing the fire together

01:43:12.580 --> 01:43:15.580
It's me, it's only you

01:43:15.580 --> 01:43:20.580
That we have found

01:43:20.580 --> 01:43:23.580
Don't save your tears, it's more than a day

01:43:23.580 --> 01:43:26.580
When nothing is far behind

01:43:26.580 --> 01:43:30.080
On your feet, I'll miss you

01:43:30.080 --> 01:43:33.580
Be a flower, you'll never mind

01:43:33.580 --> 01:43:36.580
Stand your fear, take your place

01:43:36.580 --> 01:43:40.080
Save them for their judgment day

01:43:40.080 --> 01:43:43.080
Just and free, follow me

01:43:43.080 --> 01:43:48.080
And soon they will sacrifice

01:43:48.080 --> 01:43:53.080
Your eyes were found

01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:52.080
We could forever love you

01:44:52.080 --> 01:44:56.080
Would it be that you care about me?

01:44:56.080 --> 01:44:59.080
If you don't mind me

01:44:59.080 --> 01:45:02.080
Let's go to the moonlight

01:45:02.080 --> 01:45:04.080
I'll be there

01:45:04.080 --> 01:45:05.080
Don't go around

01:45:05.080 --> 01:45:07.080
Let's just go

01:45:07.080 --> 01:45:09.080
Why don't you go?

01:45:09.080 --> 01:45:12.080
And you are here for the day

01:45:12.080 --> 01:45:15.080
When the wind is far behind

01:45:15.080 --> 01:45:18.580
On your feet, I'll be free

01:45:18.580 --> 01:45:22.080
Fear not, so you can not hide

01:45:22.080 --> 01:45:25.080
I will give, take your place

01:45:25.080 --> 01:45:28.080
Pay to fall, I just will stay

01:45:28.080 --> 01:45:33.080
But they're free, they're only time to make

01:45:33.080 --> 01:45:36.080
Let me fly

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:46.080
Here I fall back

01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:25.640
All right, song number three there, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

01:46:25.640 --> 01:46:30.160
Did that one rise to the cage match occasion or did it fall flat on its ass?

01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:31.160
Let's see, Jamie.

01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:34.840
Yoko Kanno is awesome, so the song gets a night and a half.

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:35.840
Magus.

01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.840
Pretty nice. I'd say 8.

01:47:05.840 --> 01:47:16.240
Number one you can vote for tonight, Hadaway, What is Love, Reloaded.

01:47:16.240 --> 01:47:30.080
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Midi Head with White Knuckle Ride.

01:47:30.080 --> 01:47:42.180
The song number three you can vote for tonight, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

01:47:42.180 --> 01:47:45.480
I think this is a very hard cage match to decide tonight.

01:47:45.480 --> 01:47:49.040
I think we got three really good songs in here tonight, so this is going to be an interesting

01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:50.040
one.

01:47:50.040 --> 01:47:52.040
Please vote now.

01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:56.960
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:47:56.960 --> 01:48:02.280
I know the chat room likes to bitch a lot that sometimes we give them three crappy songs to pick from but I seriously don't think

01:48:02.280 --> 01:48:07.520
You can complain about that tonight. You've got some old-school beats there with the what is love

01:48:07.520 --> 01:48:12.000
You've got some new-school like industrial sounding stuff with a MIDI head and then you've got the J

01:48:12.280 --> 01:48:17.640
Like I don't want to call it J pop, but the J opera rock or something

01:48:17.640 --> 01:48:22.040
I don't know with the yokogano. So there's definitely something to choose from from every spectrum

01:48:22.040 --> 01:48:25.280
There's some good songs. So good luck you guys trying to figure that one out should be a close one

01:48:25.280 --> 01:48:29.520
one sent a private message to sky with your vote I'm getting some votes in

01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:36.000
right now I had a question from Asian buddy Paul in our chat room he wants to

01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.840
check in on the ultra Kade kicking gallery that we're gonna have

01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:43.180
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to work on that last week we actually had a

01:48:43.180 --> 01:48:47.760
photo from one of our other listeners send in a photo of him kicking a

01:48:47.760 --> 01:48:51.560
ultra Kade machine and was wondering where you can send in those pictures

01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:55.560
Send those to Rob at OrangeOnsRadio.com. I'm gonna go ahead and just take

01:48:55.560 --> 01:48:58.600
charge with setting up the gallery, so go ahead and send those. If you happen to

01:48:58.600 --> 01:49:02.720
send them to Jamie or Matt, they will make sure I get them, or they'll get them

01:49:02.720 --> 01:49:05.840
in the gallery themselves. But you can go ahead and send those to me, Rob at OrangeOnsRadio.com.

01:49:05.840 --> 01:49:09.240
In fact, I'm kind of curious if he sent it already, because if he did, I want to

01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:14.360
show it to the folks in the studio, because I love ultra-cade kicking pictures. And

01:49:14.360 --> 01:49:19.520
again, please remind Loki or Jamie, I know you're both in on this, why should folks

01:49:19.520 --> 01:49:24.120
be sending us pictures of them kicking UltraCade machines. Because UltraCade is trying to trademark

01:49:24.120 --> 01:49:30.240
the Mame name and they can't because Mame already belongs to somebody else. So this

01:49:30.240 --> 01:49:34.080
person is a big retard so we have to kick UltraCade machines. There it is. Look at that.

01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:39.360
Lovely kick. That's not even a kick. Like they are kicking the actual panel there. There.

01:49:39.360 --> 01:49:43.000
That's a like you could get. That owns. That's a you could get busted in the arcade picture

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:47.600
right there. So thank you our buddy Paul there for sending us that. That's a great pick.

01:49:47.600 --> 01:49:51.760
Sadly enough, the abuse of these cabinets is going to have to take.

01:49:51.760 --> 01:49:55.840
We can't actually kick the Altercade components, because, I mean, Altercade is just put in

01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:57.080
these cabinets.

01:49:57.080 --> 01:49:59.880
The cabinets have no say what games inside of them.

01:49:59.880 --> 01:50:01.960
Kick the right side where it hits the jamma harness.

01:50:01.960 --> 01:50:04.360
Yes, you have to kick the jamma harness.

01:50:04.360 --> 01:50:07.960
No, no, but actually just kick any part of it, because a lot of these cabinets are sold

01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:10.600
with it already in there, so.

01:50:10.600 --> 01:50:12.320
You know what?

01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.320
They're guilty by association.

01:50:13.320 --> 01:50:15.200
Think of the cabinets, though.

01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200
And if you get busted...

01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:24.200
No, I want the disclaimer here. We did not tell you to do this. I'm not gonna get angry

01:50:24.200 --> 01:50:32.880
letters from your arcade owner. You should pose like you're kicking the machine, but

01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:37.080
don't really kick it, because we don't want to get your arcade owners upset. And if you

01:50:37.080 --> 01:50:41.640
do, and if they're mad, we don't know you. And we disown you. You were never here. That's

01:50:41.640 --> 01:50:51.840
right. Alright. Loki, you know I always ask you this around this time of the show, and

01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:56.600
you know, even if there's no news, I have to ask you anyway. What the hell is going

01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:02.480
on in the sim scene, my friend? What's going on is this fucking aim is attached to goddamn

01:51:02.480 --> 01:51:09.480
Outlook Express and that makes me angry. Stupid Outlook and MAME. Anyways, our aim. Anyways,

01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:17.480
Simzine. See, only a couple things are actually going on here. Ooh, Matrix Online launch update.

01:51:17.480 --> 01:51:24.480
Anyways, there is a couple things. First off, Technofine. They're working on yet another

01:51:24.480 --> 01:51:31.480
theme. It's, I think, Technofine Retroactive. It's like a yellow version of Technofine that

01:51:31.480 --> 01:51:36.480
looks kind of neat. There's a whole thread on it on Bamai Cell and that's supposed to

01:51:36.480 --> 01:51:40.620
be coming out. Nothing new on Food Mix 2 as far as I'm aware, but I'm going to double

01:51:40.620 --> 01:51:49.220
check just to be certain on that. Aside from that, the also there's the, I can't remember

01:51:49.220 --> 01:51:57.740
what it's called now. It was this old thing that they had going on. Virtual Visions, that's

01:51:57.740 --> 01:52:03.700
what it was. Virtual Visions, which is a project that started back in DDR Maniacs, and that

01:52:03.700 --> 01:52:09.260
was actually a group of people who were going to be taking a big list of overclocked music

01:52:09.260 --> 01:52:15.180
from Overclock.org, and those are all video game remixes, and they're making a step file

01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:20.740
pack for those, and that's still going on right now. And there's a big huge forum now,

01:52:20.740 --> 01:52:24.740
It's actually a section of their forums that you can actually check out.

01:52:26.740 --> 01:52:32.740
See, other than that, DDR Maniacs is saying they're coming back, whenever that is.

01:52:33.740 --> 01:52:37.740
But that's supposedly gonna happen. I mean, not that anyone really cares.

01:52:37.740 --> 01:52:45.740
But Mycell's talking about launching version 7 at some point, so, and they promise, like, more stuff.

01:52:45.740 --> 01:52:51.340
stuff. They remodel their site more than WeGetNewGuitarFreak's arcade mixes. Seriously.

01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:54.920
So anyways, that's supposedly happening.

01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:59.020
Um, I checked today to see if there's a new version of StepMania. Guess what? No!

01:52:59.020 --> 01:53:02.380
How long have we been waiting for StepMania 4.0?

01:53:02.380 --> 01:53:06.900
How long? Yeah, okay, that's what I'm saying. No one even cares anymore, I think.

01:53:06.900 --> 01:53:10.180
Does anyone actually play StepMania? Maybe. I don't know.

01:53:10.180 --> 01:53:13.420
I did. Um, other than that,

01:53:13.420 --> 01:53:23.420
I'm trying to see right now, we're going to go to the FoodMix page to see if there's anything going on there, because I suspect that there might be, but you know, I need to double check.

01:53:23.420 --> 01:53:39.420
Um, I was downloading, though, there's like, you know, you can get a lot of themes and stuff, um, on Mysore, they have a whole, you know, section and stuff for that, but um, let's see, FoodMix, FoodMix, FoodMix, here we go.

01:53:39.420 --> 01:53:51.100
And, what do you know, no news for FoodMix. But, it's, uh, FoodMix 2 is still in progress. No date for that. Look forward to it coming out, though, pretty soon, I'd imagine.

01:53:51.100 --> 01:54:21.060
And the next big thing we have coming up is the, um, there is another, um, thing here. I think it's, like, what was it, a DDX, yeah, DDRXX mix, and they're talking about a release date for, um, April 1st, I believe, was the release date for that one, and that's supposed to be a big, like, food mix type thing where there's a ton of, you know, different, um,

01:54:21.100 --> 01:54:26.060
things to play. So, I think that was the one. There's one of them that's launching April

01:54:26.060 --> 01:54:31.620
1st, I don't remember by chance which one that is, but I think it's that one. And that's

01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:38.420
it. Ton of, oh, there's some other people there releasing, which is kind of neat. The,

01:54:38.420 --> 01:54:44.380
oh god what was it, like, there's In The Groove stuff that's coming out right now, and then

01:54:44.380 --> 01:54:56.380
And then there's also, um, sim files for, uh, god, what was that, um, DJ Max, that are being released right now, and the DJ Max songs are pretty cool.

01:54:56.380 --> 01:55:06.380
Those are, for those who don't know, those are, um, it's an online Beatmania-type game that was made by the creators of Easy to DJ, the other DJ game that's actually pretty good.

01:55:06.380 --> 01:55:14.180
Alright, thank you for that update. It was a lot longer than I was expecting, actually.

01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:19.220
Usually it's, eh, all the signs are down, nobody cares. That's nice to know that things

01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:23.340
are still alive and kicking in the sim scene. You guys want a note to the winner of tonight's

01:55:23.340 --> 01:55:29.300
cage match? Sure, why not? Now, I thought this would be a very, very close cage match

01:55:29.300 --> 01:55:35.140
tonight because we had three very good songs, but in the end, one of these songs just, for

01:55:35.140 --> 01:55:38.900
For lack of a better term, it really just blew the other two out of the water.

01:55:38.900 --> 01:55:42.900
I don't know how else to say it, but this song definitely won tonight.

01:55:42.900 --> 01:55:50.420
It is Yoko Kanno with Rise.

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:52.180
Getting a pretty large portion of the vote tonight.

01:55:52.180 --> 01:55:53.180
That's pretty cool.

01:55:53.180 --> 01:55:55.300
I didn't realize it would be a big gap.

01:55:55.300 --> 01:55:56.980
I didn't either.

01:55:56.980 --> 01:55:58.900
I'm kind of sad by that.

01:55:58.900 --> 01:55:59.940
That's it.

01:55:59.940 --> 01:56:02.340
It's coming back.

01:56:02.340 --> 01:56:10.140

fact. This fact being, we have a peep left! And what do we do with the peep? Oh yes. It

01:57:29.200 --> 01:57:35.080
goes in the microwave. Can you get that on cam? If you're gonna do that, can you put

01:57:35.080 --> 01:57:41.360
that on cam? You can still eat it. And it'll just be nice and warm. And yes, I'm putting

01:57:41.360 --> 01:57:45.520
it on cam. If you're gonna microwave the peep, please put that on cam. Yeah. And while you're

01:57:45.520 --> 01:57:49.920

Oh yeah. It's getting big. This makes for wonderful radio, my idea. It's getting really big.

01:58:50.920 --> 01:58:58.920
It's, like, very deformed. And I think we're done.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:05.920
I will never ask you people to fill time ever again. Oh my God! I can see on the webcam! It looks like a big...

01:59:05.920 --> 01:59:09.920
It looks like our microwave has cancer. That's horrible. My God.

01:59:09.920 --> 01:59:16.500
all right okay anyway here we're gonna go to break and now Melly will eat it

01:59:16.500 --> 01:59:18.500
We'll be back after this.

01:59:46.500 --> 01:59:50.500
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

01:59:50.500 --> 01:59:53.500
First, hit the white keys.

02:00:01.500 --> 02:00:04.500
Now, hit the black keys.

02:00:04.500 --> 02:00:19.500
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

02:00:19.500 --> 02:00:21.500
Easy, huh?

02:00:21.500 --> 02:00:23.500
You better stop it, don't drop it

02:00:23.500 --> 02:00:25.500
There ain't no living here, no real life

02:00:25.500 --> 02:00:27.500
Don't you ask me, let me tell you

02:00:27.500 --> 02:00:29.500
It better change back if you see

02:00:29.500 --> 02:00:31.500
It better change back if you see

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:33.500
Alright, let's go on to the scratch game

02:00:33.500 --> 02:00:35.500
When the objects reach the red line

02:00:35.500 --> 02:00:37.500
Scratch!

02:00:37.500 --> 02:00:39.500
And if you do, don't play it

02:00:39.500 --> 02:00:41.500
Move your bullshit, you better

02:00:41.500 --> 02:00:45.500
With the fast notes, the technique is to scratch fast.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:57.500
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

02:00:57.500 --> 02:00:59.500
It's hard, but you can do it!

02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:21.500
Okay, effector time!

02:01:21.500 --> 02:01:25.500
Here's the effect of the new beatmania!

02:01:25.500 --> 02:01:29.500
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

02:01:29.500 --> 02:01:32.500
That's the effect on and on bridge.

02:01:32.500 --> 02:01:36.500
With this trimmer, you can shoot your effect.

02:01:36.500 --> 02:01:40.500
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

02:01:43.500 --> 02:01:47.500
Hey, do you hear the variety of effect?

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:52.500
With this limiter, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

02:01:54.500 --> 02:01:59.500
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:09.500
All right, here we go! Knock you out with your fabulous sound on this merry-go-round version of Speed Mania!

02:02:29.500 --> 02:02:32.500
Re-re-remixed.

02:02:32.500 --> 02:02:34.500
Re-mixed.

02:02:34.500 --> 02:02:59.940
We'll be meeting, next.

02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:25.860
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake...

02:03:25.860 --> 02:03:29.860
Solid snake, solid snake, solid snake

02:03:29.860 --> 02:03:31.860
Can you hear what I'm saying?

02:03:31.860 --> 02:03:34.860
World is down to take a man that wants him back

02:03:34.860 --> 02:03:37.860
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all

02:03:37.860 --> 02:03:39.860
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:03:39.860 --> 02:03:41.860
Down, down, what am I gonna do?

02:03:41.860 --> 02:03:43.860
Down, what am I gonna do?

02:03:47.860 --> 02:03:50.860
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

02:03:50.860 --> 02:03:52.860
We go here.

02:04:50.860 --> 02:05:17.820
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:05:17.820 --> 02:05:21.940
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, hope you enjoyed that break, Emotion was the last

02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:27.860
song you heard before that, Metal Gear, remixed there, and starting that set off was Instant

02:05:27.860 --> 02:05:32.820
Love, also known as the tutorial song from Beatmania, which, who doesn't love that song?

02:05:32.820 --> 02:05:34.620
DJ Konami is the man.

02:05:34.620 --> 02:05:35.620
What can I say?

02:05:35.620 --> 02:05:39.140
Alright, so, how did the microwave peep turn out in the end?

02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:42.460
I noticed the webcam was constantly being updated there during break, I put some random

02:05:42.460 --> 02:05:44.660
things up on cam as well, how'd that go?

02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:54.620
I turned it into an OLR logo. You are very strange. That's all I have to say. Of course,

02:05:54.620 --> 02:06:03.060
www.orangetrader.com. Oh my God, it does say OLR. I hope somebody's saving pics tonight.

02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:08.380
That's all I have to say. We are going to open up the Skype line again real quick. We'll

02:06:08.380 --> 02:06:11.700

02:06:39.380 --> 02:06:44.300
week, and we'll also get into the FUs of the week as well. But we do have a call. Hello,

02:06:44.300 --> 02:06:49.060
you are on Orange Lawn's radio. And for the third time in a row, it's Ronma. Hi, guys.

02:06:49.060 --> 02:06:54.340
Hello, Ronma, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good. Yeah? I have another picture for you.

02:06:54.340 --> 02:07:00.140
Oh, the, the, um, uh, ulcercade ticking. Mm-hmm. I, could you, could you post the link one

02:07:00.140 --> 02:07:03.660
more time in the chatroom? I didn't get a chance to look at it because I was busy queuing

02:07:03.660 --> 02:07:11.140
up that particular break. Sure, no problem. Let me scroll back up here. Here we go. The

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:15.380
wonders of the internet. I can actually hear the click, click, click, click, click. As

02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:20.980
you're scrolling up there. Yay! I hear Jamie cheering, so it must be a good picture. And

02:07:20.980 --> 02:07:25.780
there's that one. Oh, I'd seen that one previously. Is that the one you showed me on Thursday?

02:07:25.780 --> 02:07:29.380
Didn't you show me one on Thursday? I don't remember. I think those were the ones from

02:07:29.380 --> 02:07:36.380
like last from last week, and we went out this past week and got a new one.

02:07:37.940 --> 02:07:39.940
I do, I do. I'm about to get the link to that right now.

02:07:39.940 --> 02:07:41.940
Oh, okay. I want that one. Give me the new one.

02:07:41.940 --> 02:07:43.940
Okay. There you go.

02:07:43.940 --> 02:07:45.940
Yay, okay. Oh, yes.

02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:47.940
Ooh, it's big.

02:07:47.940 --> 02:07:54.940
This one's a new picture. I'd seen those two previous ones. Again, he's posted these in our chat room at www.oipontario.com.

02:07:54.940 --> 02:08:03.940
Oh, a monitor kick! Very nice. What is that guy behind you playing DDR?

02:08:03.940 --> 02:08:05.940
Oh, I have a little story about that.

02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:13.940
The guy behind you playing DDR looks like he is, like, in a shower or something. I mean, my God, he's covered in sweat.

02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:14.940
Doubles heavy.

02:08:14.940 --> 02:08:15.940
That is a sweaty, sweaty man.

02:08:15.940 --> 02:08:18.940
He's a sweaty man. What's up with that?

02:08:18.940 --> 02:08:20.940
He was playing doubles heavy.

02:08:20.940 --> 02:08:21.940
Oh, well, I guess...

02:08:21.940 --> 02:08:22.940
I don't see two sets of arrows.

02:08:22.940 --> 02:08:26.940
Wait, yeah, I don't see two sets of arrows there. He was playing, but he's not playing in the picture.

02:08:26.940 --> 02:08:32.940
Okay, it's probably just...he was playing doubles earlier. What happened was, me and my friends went to play DDR. They have two machines.

02:08:32.940 --> 02:08:37.940
He was playing. A bunch of hood rats came in and started insulting him.

02:08:37.940 --> 02:08:39.940
Oh, no.

02:08:39.940 --> 02:08:46.940
So, after he played, I said to them, why don't you guys get on and play? They're like, you first.

02:08:46.940 --> 02:08:52.940
There's the way to do it. I mean, remember that little kid we scared off from Golf Land one time because he was making fun of us?

02:08:52.940 --> 02:08:55.940
Didn't I challenge him to a duel or something and he ran away?

02:08:55.940 --> 02:09:00.940
There was one time where I had these guys hanging around and they were talking all kinds of shit, so I said,

02:09:00.940 --> 02:09:07.940
Okay, I'll pay for you to play if you really think that it's that stupid, but I pick the song.

02:09:10.940 --> 02:09:13.940
I had them thrown out later that night.

02:09:13.940 --> 02:09:18.940
So, after you kicked the Ultra-Cade machine, you had to go kick these guys a little bit?

02:09:18.940 --> 02:09:24.940
Yes, and for the first time in my life, I double-A'd all four songs, right in front of them.

02:09:24.940 --> 02:09:30.940
Oh, very nice. It's those moments of pressure when you start doing really well at DDR, huh?

02:09:30.940 --> 02:09:31.940
Yeah.

02:09:31.940 --> 02:09:33.940
Very nice. Congratulations, my friend.

02:09:33.940 --> 02:09:35.940
Thanks. Oh, and, um...

02:09:35.940 --> 02:09:40.940
And I just want to point out the arcade there. The Ultra-Cade machine is right next to the DDR machine,

02:09:40.940 --> 02:09:45.940
which I think is a very interesting setup there. But anyway, I'm sorry, your thought?

02:09:45.940 --> 02:09:56.940
Yeah, if anyone hasn't gotten it yet, the PSP is coming out on Thursday. Best Buy, you can go right to Best Buy and pick it up at 8 o'clock in the morning. No reserves, first come, first serve.

02:09:56.940 --> 02:10:04.940
If you were a lazy bum and didn't pre-order it, like myself, that's probably going to be your only option, and that is exactly what I had to do with the DS, because I'm a lazy bum.

02:10:04.940 --> 02:10:08.740
to counter that, you could just preorder it at Gamestop, have somebody call you the day

02:10:08.740 --> 02:10:11.340
before and pick it up at your convenience.

02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:12.780
Even better.

02:10:12.780 --> 02:10:13.780
You could.

02:10:13.780 --> 02:10:16.620
Or you could have a fiancé that works at Gamestop and just bring it home.

02:10:16.620 --> 02:10:20.100
Exactly, and he could be all, Bitch, bring it home!

02:10:20.100 --> 02:10:23.700
Because it's gonna be, Or I ain't putting out, I ain't putting out.

02:10:23.700 --> 02:10:28.500
And my Final Fantasy XI atlas.

02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:31.500
I totally want a Final Fantasy XI atlas, but then again I don't.

02:10:31.500 --> 02:10:32.500
I quit that game.

02:10:32.500 --> 02:10:34.900
I quit that game, Rob, I quit that game.

02:10:34.900 --> 02:10:37.820
Anyway, any other thoughts, Rama, before I let you go?

02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:40.660
One thing, I have one of my new friends just listening tonight.

02:10:40.660 --> 02:10:42.860
I just want to say, hi, Liz.

02:10:42.860 --> 02:10:43.580
Hi, Liz.

02:10:43.580 --> 02:10:44.740
Shout out.

02:10:44.740 --> 02:10:46.060
Shout out.

02:10:46.060 --> 02:10:47.180
Hey, Carson.

02:10:47.180 --> 02:10:49.260
I love Britney Spears.

02:10:49.260 --> 02:10:50.380
Pay me some Britney Spears.

02:10:50.380 --> 02:10:52.860
I want to give a shout out to Liz.

02:10:52.860 --> 02:10:54.360
Hi, Liz.

02:10:54.360 --> 02:10:56.540
And I'm going to do my special impersonation just

02:10:56.540 --> 02:10:57.300
for your friend.

02:10:57.300 --> 02:10:57.800
OK.

02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.940
Thank you.

02:11:01.940 --> 02:11:03.100
You guys rock.

02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:04.020
All right, thank you.

02:11:04.020 --> 02:11:08.900
you rock for calling. Have a good one. You too. Later. Hi. How about a ferret before

02:11:08.900 --> 02:11:11.940
I pick up the next call? How about a ferret beep for Liz? Well then I gotta get to the

02:11:11.940 --> 02:11:17.420
next call. Really quick. Okay, really quick. Then I'm getting to this next call. Ferret

02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:30.340
SSJ100 Matt. Hello SSJ100 Matt. What is on your mind, my friend? Nothing. I just want

02:11:30.340 --> 02:11:36.340
I just want to apologize to a dark sacra about the little argument in the chat room earlier.

02:11:36.340 --> 02:11:37.340
Okay.

02:11:37.340 --> 02:11:38.340
Okay, apology accepted.

02:11:38.340 --> 02:11:39.340
Thank you.

02:11:39.340 --> 02:11:40.340
Okay.

02:11:40.340 --> 02:11:41.340
Okay.

02:11:41.340 --> 02:11:42.340
Aww.

02:11:42.340 --> 02:11:43.340
Aww, I love moments.

02:11:43.340 --> 02:11:44.340
That's so sweet.

02:11:44.340 --> 02:11:45.340
I love moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:11:45.340 --> 02:11:46.340
Aww.

02:11:46.340 --> 02:11:47.340
See, I'm nice.

02:11:47.340 --> 02:11:48.340
I'm nice.

02:11:48.340 --> 02:11:50.260
I'm the bad guy.

02:11:50.260 --> 02:11:53.340
Nobody said you weren't a nice guy, it's just you might have some typing issues.

02:11:53.340 --> 02:11:54.340
No, I'm kidding.

02:11:54.340 --> 02:11:55.340
I'm totally kidding.

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:56.340
I get criticized for my pronunciation.

02:11:56.340 --> 02:11:57.340
Pronunciation.

02:11:57.340 --> 02:11:58.340
Pronunciation.

02:11:58.340 --> 02:11:59.340
Pronunciation.

02:11:59.340 --> 02:12:05.340
Well, when I was four, I glued my fingers together, so, you know.

02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:07.340
It happens.

02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:08.340
Exactly.

02:12:08.340 --> 02:12:12.340
Any thoughts on 2DX Nightstyle, or any of the new stuff coming out?

02:12:12.340 --> 02:12:14.340
Um, I don't really know what that is.

02:12:14.340 --> 02:12:16.340
Oh, that's alright. In the Groove, you know that one?

02:12:16.340 --> 02:12:25.340
Yeah, well, you know, my arcade kind of has it, except they don't, but you know, they've had like the whole box and everything for it,

02:12:25.340 --> 02:12:30.340
everything for it, but they still have DDR fourth mix.

02:12:30.340 --> 02:12:33.340
In the groove cabinet they have DDR fourth mix?

02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:35.340
Yeah, they've had it in there for like about two weeks.

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:42.340
Now, that is ironic, when you consider that In the Groove is kind of a stowaway game, and you always see In the Groove and DDR cabinets, that is great.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.340
That sounds like an upgrade.

02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:48.340
It is an upgrade. I agree with you on that.

02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:53.340
Alright, very nice. I miss fourth mix. Fourth mix was such a wonderful mix.

02:12:53.340 --> 02:12:55.340
Is it 4th plus or 4th mix?

02:12:55.340 --> 02:12:57.340
4th plus.

02:12:57.340 --> 02:12:59.340
Play some conga feelin' for me.

02:12:59.340 --> 02:13:01.340
Cause we don't have 4th plus here anymore.

02:13:01.340 --> 02:13:03.340
He's like, no way.

02:13:03.340 --> 02:13:05.340
No way.

02:13:05.340 --> 02:13:07.340
Alright, try it.

02:13:07.340 --> 02:13:09.340
Play some Rhythm and Police.

02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:11.340
Rhythm and Police is cool.

02:13:11.340 --> 02:13:13.340
Alright, any other thoughts SSJ?

02:13:13.340 --> 02:13:19.340
Not really, just a little excited about the anime convention in Arizona that's coming this week.

02:13:19.340 --> 02:13:21.340
What city?

02:13:21.340 --> 02:13:24.860
Phoenix, all right, right on. And what's the name of it?

02:13:24.860 --> 02:13:28.420
Anizona, Anizona.

02:13:28.420 --> 02:13:32.740
Okay. Oh, like Arizona, but Anizona. I get it. That's cute. Okay.

02:13:32.740 --> 02:13:36.580
And the guest of honor is Yoshitaka Mano.

02:13:36.580 --> 02:13:41.060
Oh, okay. I'm going to Arizona. Bye, y'all.

02:13:41.060 --> 02:13:45.220
Are you really? No. But I would. Oh my god, he's like my favorite artist.

02:13:45.220 --> 02:13:48.220
Our webmaster lives in Arizona. I bet you he might be checking that out.

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:51.480
Jason has to go talk to my hero for me.

02:13:51.480 --> 02:13:53.720
Jason's not listening tonight, which is kinda weird.

02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:54.520
Damn him!

02:13:54.520 --> 02:13:55.920
I know.

02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:56.720
Alright, well...

02:13:56.720 --> 02:13:59.420
I need to meet my artistic hero.

02:13:59.420 --> 02:14:04.020
Have fun at the convention, if we had money we would go too, but unfortunately we're poor, so we have to go to the...

02:14:04.020 --> 02:14:07.620
Maybe I'll get an autograph for Sakura as a peace offering.

02:14:07.620 --> 02:14:09.420
Aww, that's so nice of you!

02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:12.920
Aww, I just feel like... I just want to give you both a hug.

02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:14.520
I'll stop convoking you.

02:14:14.520 --> 02:14:15.720
Alright.

02:14:15.720 --> 02:14:19.160
Have a good one, buddy. Thanks for calling in. That was very big of you. Have a good one.

02:14:19.160 --> 02:14:22.160
Yep, bye. Later. Aww.

02:14:22.160 --> 02:14:26.040
Aww, I'm just feeling- I feel fuzzy wuzzy and I

02:14:26.040 --> 02:14:29.320
I feel sick! Rob? Yes.

02:14:29.320 --> 02:14:32.400
Alright, that was fun.

02:14:32.400 --> 02:14:37.120
Ahh. A lovely, uh,

02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:40.560
Skype segment tonight. Can't complain about that one.

02:14:40.560 --> 02:14:43.860
I was gonna go to a break, but then I realized we just had a break. We can't do

02:14:43.860 --> 02:14:45.080
that, so we need to-

02:14:45.080 --> 02:14:51.080
Yeah, we need to take a break from race. We need to get into the FUs of the week, is what we need to do, dammit.

02:14:51.080 --> 02:14:53.080
I'm not angry anymore!

02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:55.080
Which is exactly why we need to do it now.

02:15:00.080 --> 02:15:02.080
Actually, something did piss me off a lot today.

02:15:02.080 --> 02:15:06.080
Alright, so good, we do have something. So, then, that being said, you guys can send it in.

02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:11.080
Oh, I'm sorry, Angel. Oh, I just, now I'm gonna get an FU for that, I'm gonna get an FU for that.

02:15:11.080 --> 02:15:13.080
You're about to bust that thing of coke open.

02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:24.080
Seriously, um, I'm sorry. Uh, you can send in your FUs over private message. Please keep them short. Be courteous of the other listeners who want to get in their FUs as well.

02:15:24.080 --> 02:15:28.080
Uh, Dark Sacra, why do we do this every single week?

02:15:28.080 --> 02:15:29.080
Ah!

02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:49.720
Okay, I have to explain this.

02:15:49.720 --> 02:15:54.420
Everybody knows that I have this thing about old people who drive really, really slow,

02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:57.880
and then I have a thing about people who talk on their cell phones while they drive.

02:15:57.880 --> 02:16:03.480
I had the ultimate in piss off today because I was stuck behind this old guy talking on

02:16:03.480 --> 02:16:11.040
his cell phone who was he looked like he was all veiny and ancient and like leaning over

02:16:11.040 --> 02:16:15.920
over the steering wheel you know that type and then talking on his damn cell phone I'm

02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:20.320
like veiny and ancient you know what I mean when people get really

02:16:20.320 --> 02:16:31.920
old that you can feel their pain. His wife was in the car with him. I don't think anyone

02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:38.200
was having a heart attack. Billy! How did you get trapped in the phone? Anyway, I just

02:16:38.200 --> 02:16:43.240
passed him and cut him off and that was good. Did that make you feel better? Yeah it did.

02:16:43.240 --> 02:16:45.240
I didn't really cut them off, but eh.

02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:54.560
Um, another F.U. goes toward our lovely president, fucking asshole, for um, bringing Senate to

02:16:54.560 --> 02:17:00.660
vote about that lady in Florida, with the, that had the, alright, this is a lady who

02:17:00.660 --> 02:17:06.740
had been brain dead for 15 years, getting no oxygen to her brain, she was a vegetable,

02:17:06.740 --> 02:17:11.820
she still is a vegetable, she will not be anything but a living vegetable, and so they

02:17:11.820 --> 02:17:16.720
got authorization to take the feeding tube out finally and said it is you know

02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:20.640
they have other things they could be voting on like you know allotting more

02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:28.240
money toward you know useful things or you know improvement of our social

02:17:28.240 --> 02:17:32.940
systems instead they're voting on whether or not to let a basically a

02:17:32.940 --> 02:17:37.600
corpse on life support actually be a real corpse and said you know they're

02:17:37.600 --> 02:17:42.700
costing this family all of these doctor bills just because of this whole right

02:17:42.700 --> 02:17:47.440
to die issue she's not there anymore sorry no one home let her go

02:17:47.440 --> 02:17:55.440
but Jamie we can rebuild them we have the technology we could put Walt Disney's

02:17:55.440 --> 02:18:00.540
brain in there. E.T. phoned home already. What we're left with is to actually she's

02:18:00.540 --> 02:18:07.220
probably more intelligent than him right now but I say you know why I say we

02:18:07.220 --> 02:18:11.280
electus lady president. She'd do a better job. You know what I'm scared about? The fact

02:18:11.280 --> 02:18:17.720
that we have living dead. We do. Stop cultivating zombies. You know she's gonna get out of the

02:18:17.720 --> 02:18:24.720
bed. Brains! Brains! That's why she's brain dead! She needs brains! You see, you see.

02:18:25.720 --> 02:18:31.720
This woman is starving to death for 14 days and you're like, brain! Well, let you guys

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:36.720
starve to death! Oh, that's what we need, a brain dead person starving for brains! That's

02:18:36.720 --> 02:18:39.760
Okay, I F you, so fuck you, shut up!

02:18:39.760 --> 02:18:44.080
She does not know

02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:47.360
that she's starving. She doesn't have

02:18:47.360 --> 02:18:54.360
the capacity to register pain.

02:18:57.120 --> 02:19:01.120
Okay, how about when they pull the plug on life support? Same thing.

02:19:01.120 --> 02:19:06.120
That tube is her life support.

02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:08.120
it's not like her heart shuts down and she dies

02:19:08.120 --> 02:19:10.120
she is unable to eat

02:19:10.120 --> 02:19:12.120
she's not even there

02:19:12.120 --> 02:19:14.120
it's a body with no place

02:19:14.120 --> 02:19:16.120
i think it's gonna be one of those

02:19:16.120 --> 02:19:18.120
two words to settle a dispute

02:19:18.120 --> 02:19:20.120
lethal injection

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:22.120
okay? if you're going to kill her

02:19:22.120 --> 02:19:24.120
do it quickly

02:19:24.120 --> 02:19:26.120
don't leave her to wither and starve

02:19:26.120 --> 02:19:28.120
and die away slowly

02:19:28.120 --> 02:19:30.120
this is my epi thank you

02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:32.120
we disagree with you

02:19:32.120 --> 02:19:34.120
i honestly

02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:39.280
would prefer lethal injection but if they have to do anything you know the

02:19:39.280 --> 02:19:42.940
only legal recourse they have is to take the tube out and let her die of natural

02:19:42.940 --> 02:19:46.720
causes because technically it is a natural cause she is incapable of taking

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:51.380
care of herself she's not even there anymore there's nobody home you know

02:19:51.380 --> 02:19:56.100
basically it's letting a corpse be a corpse you know you don't keep you know

02:19:56.100 --> 02:20:00.220
here take your vitamin dead person let me dig you up and put a chicken wing

02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:03.580
but then if she's not there anymore how is the rest of her body functioning

02:20:03.580 --> 02:20:06.500
without any life support so obviously her brain is working enough to keep her

02:20:06.500 --> 02:20:10.340
heart beating very minimal functions but there but how do you know she can't feel

02:20:10.340 --> 02:20:15.040
anything how do you know she can't feel starvation okay there's no there is no

02:20:15.040 --> 02:20:22.020
mind or soul left in her body it has departed it's that there's nothing there

02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:26.060
she can't she cannot maintain the cognitive functions of the of the

02:20:26.060 --> 02:20:31.060
average human being I'll put it that way she has no cognitive functions and the

02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:37.160
story at any rate I I would say that if they could just go ahead and kill her I

02:20:37.160 --> 02:20:40.720
would say if they could legally get away with just injecting her and killing her

02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:45.400
to do it I would encourage somebody to go you get it at home no no no you

02:20:45.400 --> 02:20:49.480
wouldn't this is gonna be one of those ironic things where they're gonna have

02:20:49.480 --> 02:20:54.160
this whole battle it's like that movie um what is it citizen Ruth it's just

02:20:54.160 --> 02:20:57.240
like that movie it's a big abortion should she or should she not have an

02:20:57.240 --> 02:21:00.800
abortion and then at the end she miscarries it's gonna be one of those

02:21:00.800 --> 02:21:05.460
type of things where like she's gonna end up she's gonna like roll and fall

02:21:05.460 --> 02:21:08.960
out of her bed and get like kill herself that way or something it's gonna be one

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:12.440
of those like really tragic things after this big huge fight something else will

02:21:12.440 --> 02:21:18.260
happen that's my prediction you heard it here at any rate one way or another she

02:21:18.260 --> 02:21:23.900
shouldn't have to her her husband should not be made to suffer watching basically

02:21:23.900 --> 02:21:29.620
this joke of his wife be kept on life support there's no reason for it and I

02:21:29.620 --> 02:21:33.220
feel really bad for him you know and then her family you know her parents

02:21:33.220 --> 02:21:38.100
are holding on to fault hope she's not waking up you know if they if they truly

02:21:38.100 --> 02:21:48.400
loved her they would let her go yeah let's end on an agreement please she

02:21:48.400 --> 02:21:54.060
needs to die one way or another please let's end on an agreement all right

02:21:54.060 --> 02:21:55.060
Nice to be killed.

02:21:55.060 --> 02:21:56.060
Any other FUs, Jamie?

02:21:56.060 --> 02:21:57.060
Break her neck.

02:21:57.060 --> 02:21:58.060
Um.

02:21:58.060 --> 02:21:59.060
What?

02:21:59.060 --> 02:22:00.060
Roll so fast.

02:22:00.060 --> 02:22:04.420
I say we give her the log treatment.

02:22:04.420 --> 02:22:05.820
No, that's bad.

02:22:05.820 --> 02:22:06.820
No, seriously.

02:22:06.820 --> 02:22:09.900
Um, my other FUs, I really don't have any.

02:22:09.900 --> 02:22:12.420
That's just really been sort of my inferior- Oh, yeah?

02:22:12.420 --> 02:22:15.260
Um, fuck you to the worm in Silent Hill 3.

02:22:15.260 --> 02:22:16.260
Ew.

02:22:16.260 --> 02:22:17.740
And I'm done.

02:22:17.740 --> 02:22:18.740
Alright.

02:22:18.740 --> 02:22:19.740
Okay, afterthought.

02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:20.900
Revive Jeffrey Dahmer.

02:22:20.900 --> 02:22:21.900
Have him go at it.

02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:22.900
Oh, my God.

02:22:22.900 --> 02:22:23.900
You guys are weird.

02:22:23.900 --> 02:22:27.900
Okay, let's go. Um, let's go to Loki.

02:22:27.900 --> 02:22:32.900
Don't acknowledge that with a comment on air, please.

02:22:32.900 --> 02:22:37.900
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this. Where is the status of Florida, right?

02:22:37.900 --> 02:22:44.900
Dude, do we need any more proof? I mean, come on. They're the ones that's gonna bring upon the end of the world with zombies.

02:22:44.900 --> 02:22:49.900
The whole thing is the Republicans trying to one-up the Democrats. That's all it is. It's power play.

02:22:49.900 --> 02:22:52.700
It's because it's in Florida, and that's where, you know...

02:22:52.700 --> 02:22:55.400
And there's, you know, jabs in charge there.

02:22:55.400 --> 02:23:02.100
Okay, 100,000 people died in a tsunami in January, and we are all hung up on this joke.

02:23:02.100 --> 02:23:06.400
Yeah, but did any of them turn into zombies? That's what I want to know.

02:23:06.400 --> 02:23:07.400
I don't know.

02:23:07.400 --> 02:23:15.900
At any rate, at any rate, you know, the body, true, it can live without cognitive function, but that doesn't necessarily constitute life.

02:23:15.900 --> 02:23:20.100
you know what's gonna happen they're gonna pull out that goddamn tube she's

02:23:20.100 --> 02:23:25.140
gonna breathe and it starts there I seriously cannot take this topic anymore

02:23:25.140 --> 02:23:30.540
please I think behind it is just that the Republicans are trying to wind up

02:23:30.540 --> 02:23:38.300
the Democrats that's all it is okay all right anyways so here's here's my

02:23:38.300 --> 02:23:42.500
solution to the whole problem we should have America because America can make

02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:46.180
great decisions like choosing the american idol we should have them vote

02:23:46.180 --> 02:23:50.540
on how she died now this can be anywhere from like being shot out of a cannon

02:23:50.540 --> 02:23:53.980
to drop from a plane, space shuttle, mirror

02:23:53.980 --> 02:23:58.340
I mean it doesn't really matter just you know have her die because she can't feel pain

02:23:58.340 --> 02:24:02.420
I mean might as well contribute to society she cannot she's brain dead

02:24:02.420 --> 02:24:06.580
okay I'll put it this way her nervous system

02:24:06.580 --> 02:24:10.780
can register a pain response but her brain does not understand

02:24:10.780 --> 02:24:13.780
that she is in pain because there's nothing there!

02:24:13.780 --> 02:24:16.780
How about we poke her and then she goes OW!

02:24:16.780 --> 02:24:18.780
Then we'll know that she can feel pain.

02:24:18.780 --> 02:24:20.780
Well, tough, then she's not feeling pain.

02:24:20.780 --> 02:24:21.780
She's not there!

02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:24.780
Okay, so that's enough of that.

02:24:24.780 --> 02:24:26.780
We're gonna have a heart attack and then we're gonna have a fight.

02:24:26.780 --> 02:24:28.780
How is she gonna kill us?

02:24:28.780 --> 02:24:31.780
Well, he's already dead. He's not a zombie.

02:24:31.780 --> 02:24:32.780
Rob, I promise you.

02:24:32.780 --> 02:24:33.780
I think we should chop off her head.

02:24:33.780 --> 02:24:37.780
If every cat's on life support with a tube in your stomach, we'll let you go.

02:24:37.780 --> 02:24:39.780
You pull that fucking tube out. I don't want to be a vegetable.

02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:45.480
be a vegetable. That's right, you know out. No, I already said this. I decree this. If

02:24:45.480 --> 02:24:51.140
I am in that state, I want you to fling, I want to be put in a catapult, and I want to

02:24:51.140 --> 02:24:55.460
be flung against a glass building. Flung at the White House. No, I want to be flung at

02:24:55.460 --> 02:25:00.700
a glass building. I want to be flung at the Apple Building during lunch hour. That would

02:25:00.700 --> 02:25:04.940
be rad. That is my request, thank you. Can we dress you up in all matching clothes so

02:25:04.940 --> 02:25:12.620
that you know you can match your ipod or one of the one of the things is that she

02:25:12.620 --> 02:25:16.300
had actually been witnessing that she would never want to be maintained on life support

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:27.500
anyway seriously loki that comment oh my god i only on this show i i i and we still don't get

02:25:27.500 --> 02:25:31.980
hate mail that is the amazing thing we don't get hate mail over comments like that i am the voice

02:25:31.980 --> 02:25:39.740
of the people what can I say anyways so further FUs of the week go to bad

02:25:39.740 --> 02:25:43.460
drivers especially people that don't know how to drive in rain because when

02:25:43.460 --> 02:25:47.240
the rain drops are big and there's pea-sized hail coming down what do you do

02:25:47.240 --> 02:25:52.020
you need to drive faster that's right so you can slip on the you know the water

02:25:52.020 --> 02:25:56.160
and stuff and hydroplane off a cliff or something because that's what people do

02:25:56.160 --> 02:26:00.900
and that's what people did today except they didn't fall off a cliff and they

02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:07.100
They just got in a car accident and made a U-turn over a median and stuff like that.

02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:09.620
Go people.

02:26:09.620 --> 02:26:20.100

02:33:24.160 --> 02:33:27.160
Almost like, you know, kind of like a ventriloquist doll.

02:33:29.160 --> 02:33:35.160
They could like, you know, tie her to like bars and stuff so, you know, they could have someone do a tap dance and she does a tap dance.

02:33:38.160 --> 02:33:41.160
I think we need to go to a break. Oh my gosh.

02:33:42.160 --> 02:33:48.160
In this break, I want to show some keyboard mania love in this break because I just, I want to hear some keyboard mania songs.

at Keyboard Mania, little known fact. I used to be pretty good at it. I wasn't like blue

02:40:45.800 --> 02:40:52.080

02:41:10.220 --> 02:41:15.120
audio blogging. Just because it's called a podcast, doesn't mean you need an iPod to

gets the real weirdos and it gets the noobs the noobs then the trolls and it

02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:40.960
always gets an interesting post so this actually was nominated by one of our

02:42:40.960 --> 02:42:46.200
listeners Flair O'Nai sent me a private message and said dude DDR freak post of

02:42:46.200 --> 02:42:52.440
the week right here and I said dude you're right so here it is this post is

02:42:52.440 --> 02:43:02.680
titled is it possible to have sex while playing DDR here goes the message is it

02:43:02.680 --> 02:43:07.560
possible to have sex while playing DDR I mean like not cheating like on the

02:43:07.560 --> 02:43:15.200
controller, spelled wrong, but really is it? I am going to attempt it tonight. I'm going

02:43:15.200 --> 02:43:22.680
over someone's house. I hope their BF don't get mad. And then wink icon, smile icon, grin

02:43:22.680 --> 02:43:32.600
icon. Hm, what else? Hm, yeah people. Anyone get a AAA on Legend of Max? And that is our

02:43:32.600 --> 02:43:35.340
Are DDR free posts of the week?

02:43:35.340 --> 02:43:37.820
Technically, yes it is possible.

02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:42.100
If it's sex, and it's DDR, chances are Loki knows about it.

02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:45.680
It would be possible, and this is the only way how, because it's very, it would be very

02:43:45.680 --> 02:43:47.900
difficult to have sex on DDR.

02:43:47.900 --> 02:43:52.060
You would have to probably be playing Disney Mix, and you'd have to play Mickey Mouse March

02:43:52.060 --> 02:43:54.140
because it's all left and right arrows.

02:43:54.140 --> 02:43:58.940
So as long as someone is on like a countertop that's placed right next to the pad, you could

02:43:58.940 --> 02:44:03.820
probably be able to step to left and right arrows while thrusting into them. That'd be

02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:06.540
the only way. Otherwise, it's impossible.

02:44:06.540 --> 02:44:10.620
Um, I don't know if you understand the joke about this segment, but you're not actually

02:44:10.620 --> 02:44:19.800
supposed to reply to these posts. Might I say, the post, just as a footnote, the post

02:44:19.800 --> 02:44:25.580
was promptly locked in the next post by everyone's favorite admin, Spike. So you're going over

02:44:25.580 --> 02:44:29.780
to someone's house and try to get them to cheat on their boyfriend with you by having

02:44:29.780 --> 02:44:33.060
sex while playing DDR. Sweet Jesus, what's happened to kids these days?

02:44:33.060 --> 02:44:39.860
Lock. I'm just saying it's possible. I'm not saying that anyone should try it because that's

02:44:39.860 --> 02:44:47.340
retarded. DarkSock already had a thought. Just hit the pause button, get it done with,

02:44:47.340 --> 02:44:49.340
Then go back and play.

02:44:52.340 --> 02:44:54.340
There you go.

02:44:58.340 --> 02:45:00.340
God, I love DDR Freak.

02:45:00.340 --> 02:45:02.340
What do we do without DDR Freak?

02:45:02.340 --> 02:45:04.340
We have fun.

02:45:06.340 --> 02:45:09.340
I'm so glad the microphone didn't pick up your little comment.

02:45:11.340 --> 02:45:13.340
No, um, Magus.

02:45:13.340 --> 02:45:29.100
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange

02:45:29.100 --> 02:45:35.620
Lounge Radio? We have some noobs tonight who are asking some questions. I just hope they're

02:45:35.620 --> 02:45:47.020
not as bad as the post on DDR Freak. Why does Orange Lounge have a few syllables in there?

02:45:47.020 --> 02:45:52.260
Is it possible to have sex while listening to Orange Lounge? Yes, but we highly discourage

02:45:52.260 --> 02:45:56.940
it. Yes, but don't tell us about it. Don't be too loud because you won't be able to hear

02:45:56.940 --> 02:46:12.840
the show. When we say F you of the week we don't actually mean F. Starting off, I have

02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:16.280
to ask a follow up question to that because they want us to ask something there. Let's

02:46:16.280 --> 02:46:23.200
go to this next one. VGM. Dear Orange Lounge Radio, do you guys and girls get paid for

02:46:23.200 --> 02:46:34.620
were doing this? No. I wish. What can I say? No, we don't actually at this time. This is

02:46:34.620 --> 02:46:37.960
why you might remember at the beginning of the show I announced that Orange Lounge Radio

02:46:37.960 --> 02:46:43.120
is taking steps to become a business and myself, Jamie and Matt, we are all officially a partnership

02:46:43.120 --> 02:46:51.300
now so you may see some little ads come to the site in the future but no panic please.

02:46:51.300 --> 02:46:58.040
We hate banner ads, we hate pop-ups, so we're trying to think of things where you could

02:46:58.040 --> 02:47:02.320
purchase things from Orange Lounge Radio and it would be stuff you would want and actually

02:47:02.320 --> 02:47:03.680
be interested in.

02:47:03.680 --> 02:47:07.560
We're not going to have free iPod banners and stuff if we can help it.

02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:12.040
I'm not going to say never ever because we might get desperate, but for the time being

02:47:12.040 --> 02:47:13.240
we're not planning on that.

02:47:13.240 --> 02:47:15.480
We hate ads on the internet just like the rest of you.

02:47:15.480 --> 02:47:19.800
We're going to make it all tasteful and maybe someday, yes, we can make money doing this

02:47:19.800 --> 02:47:22.840
because that would be cool. Because who wouldn't want to quit their job and do

02:47:22.840 --> 02:47:30.800
Orange Lawns Radio? Seriously. Illusion says, Orange Lawns Radio question. If

02:47:30.800 --> 02:47:36.520
there were a sequel to be made of any music game, not Bahmani, that is US, such

02:47:36.520 --> 02:47:41.280
as Frequency, Amplitude, or Taiko Drum Master, that doesn't seem like it will

02:47:41.280 --> 02:47:46.760
have a sequel, which one would you want to see a sequel from? Any thoughts on

02:47:46.760 --> 02:48:00.040
this. Magus. Gitaroo Man, hands down. I would like to see another sequel to Bust-A-Move

02:48:00.040 --> 02:48:04.560
Groove, whatever you want to call it. It was Dance Summit. Yeah, but I'd like to see something

02:48:04.560 --> 02:48:09.500
break in the US market. A real Bust-A-Move sequel with all the characters again. Yeah,

02:48:09.500 --> 02:48:12.380
I mean, I'd like to see another one of those, because that was really the game that got

02:48:12.380 --> 02:48:16.220
me into DDR in the first place, I have to correct. And I know it's Jamie's pet peeve

02:48:16.220 --> 02:48:19.280
to call those games Bust a Groove, but when I got into them, that's what I knew them as,

02:48:19.280 --> 02:48:23.140
so I have to call them Bust a Groove. Yes?

02:48:23.140 --> 02:48:31.140
I know, more, um, uh, Puyo Da. That's not a U.S. game, though, is it?

02:48:31.140 --> 02:48:34.780
Puyo Da needs to come out in the U.S., then. All right, Loki?

02:48:34.780 --> 02:48:40.260
I have a serious and unserious one. Serious one would be a Rez sequel, and...

02:48:40.260 --> 02:48:45.500
Oh, God, yes, I didn't even think of that. And, and, and the unserious one would be whatever

02:48:45.500 --> 02:48:52.500
Remember it was that Aerosmith game where you fight with CDs? Revolution X2. We should

02:48:52.580 --> 02:48:59.580
make a Revolution X2. Wow. It could be versus the RIA this time instead of like, you know,

02:49:01.420 --> 02:49:08.420
the drug dealers and stuff. Alright, um, let's see, moving on. You know what else though?

02:49:08.420 --> 02:49:15.420
Let's see, moving on. Oh, you know what else though? Space Channel 5. I'd love to see another one, because, oh god, I love Ooh La La.

02:49:15.420 --> 02:49:21.420
Revolution X2 starring the Beastie Boys, because they haven't done anything good in a long time.

02:49:21.420 --> 02:49:27.420
There are, however, music games that don't need a sequel. Mad Maestro, Unison, I can't think of any of those.

02:49:27.420 --> 02:49:31.420
Alright. I like Technic Peek. You shut your mouth.

02:49:31.420 --> 02:49:35.420
Lazer1234543 asks,

02:49:35.420 --> 02:49:39.420
Can you play some Taku and give a shout out to my site?

02:49:39.420 --> 02:49:43.420
I hate to break it to you bud, but we actually played not one but TWO Taku songs earlier

02:49:43.420 --> 02:49:47.420
in the show. What we did, Empathy, and I think Karma was the other one.

02:49:47.420 --> 02:49:51.420
Gotta tune in to 630 otherwise you miss them. Sorry. Maybe if we

02:49:51.420 --> 02:49:55.420
have time we'll fit one more in because I know Jamie will always take any excuse to play Taku.

02:49:55.420 --> 02:49:56.420
Yeah.

02:49:56.420 --> 02:49:57.420
Story time with Rob.

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:58.420
Oh, I know.

02:49:58.420 --> 02:50:00.420
I will get to that, so.

02:50:00.420 --> 02:50:01.420
Sure.

02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:02.420
Let's see.

02:50:02.420 --> 02:50:05.420
Oh, uh, can we give a shout out to my site?

02:50:05.420 --> 02:50:07.660
Sure, but you will have to pay for that.

02:50:07.660 --> 02:50:09.100
Um, no, I'm kidding.

02:50:09.100 --> 02:50:10.100
Sure, why not?

02:50:10.100 --> 02:50:15.900
It's laser123454321.com, but he says it's down right now, but I guess it's, um, step

02:50:15.900 --> 02:50:16.900
mania stuff?

02:50:16.900 --> 02:50:17.900
So, check it out.

02:50:17.900 --> 02:50:20.700
I'm sure I've been to it, I just can't remember.

02:50:20.700 --> 02:50:23.300
They all start, you know, running together.

02:50:23.300 --> 02:50:24.540
Your mind is just a big blur.

02:50:24.540 --> 02:50:28.660
I need to go look for the Japanese sites again, because I used to have a bunch of them bookmarked.

02:50:28.660 --> 02:50:32.860
Then they kind of, like, disappeared, and now the new ones are coming back.

02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:34.420
Alright.

02:50:34.420 --> 02:50:40.120
Uh, AsianBuddyPaul says, OrangeLawnsRadio question, I'm a latecomer to Ragnarok Online.

02:50:40.120 --> 02:50:43.900
Why is it so damn addicting? I will defer this question to Jamie.

02:50:43.900 --> 02:50:50.100
You know what, I'm still wondering myself. The only reason that I got out of it was just that I got way too busy to play,

02:50:50.100 --> 02:50:52.320
and now I'm on Final Fantasy XI.

02:50:52.320 --> 02:50:57.040
But you know what's sad is that I've had had second thoughts about reactivating my account

02:50:57.040 --> 02:51:03.720
because I was up to like level 80 something on my assassin.

02:51:03.720 --> 02:51:06.800
Alright, you know why?

02:51:06.800 --> 02:51:13.200
Because it kind of, a lot of the MMOs now are 3D and Ragnarok is 3D to an extent but

02:51:13.200 --> 02:51:17.340
it still has that 2D feel, it has that Secret of Mana feel and I think a lot of folks that

02:51:17.340 --> 02:51:21.440
are into retro gaming have a special love for it for that reason.

02:51:21.440 --> 02:51:31.640
me crazy but I think that's it. MPQ. Why are so many Babani songs rated badly? I know at

02:51:31.640 --> 02:51:39.140
least one song I like that's rated three levels higher than I think it is. What's with that?

02:51:39.140 --> 02:51:45.520
I don't know if he means like how burning the floor ratings. If you're talking about

02:51:45.520 --> 02:51:49.520
Stepmania, that's a whole... people can't write their songs at all there.

02:51:49.520 --> 02:51:56.520
What was that song I was playing earlier this week that was a 13 on Heavy and they had a...

02:51:56.520 --> 02:52:02.520
was it Expert or Extreme or whatever version that was 20 that I was like, this is retarded?

02:52:02.520 --> 02:52:04.520
What's the point?

02:52:05.520 --> 02:52:07.520
Gotta love this.

02:52:09.520 --> 02:52:11.520
Yeah, I don't know.

02:52:11.520 --> 02:52:18.520
Um, why are they, I would say it's because with different mixes you get different developers

02:52:18.520 --> 02:52:22.800
slightly each time so you have different opinions on what songs should be rated. I don't think

02:52:22.800 --> 02:52:28.520
they have a formula or anything, um, so that's the best answer I got.

02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:38.240
Um, SSJ100Matt. I'm actually planning a cross-country trip over the summer and I was thinking of

02:52:38.240 --> 02:52:42.120
visiting your studios along the way back from Phoenix to New York my question is

02:52:42.120 --> 02:52:47.800
if I could visit you guys and be on the show well I don't see why not but this

02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:50.960
is the thing we've got a you know we're gonna have to draw the line at some

02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:55.000
point since we're still underground we're cool with our fans visiting us but

02:52:55.000 --> 02:52:59.440
one day when we're fucking famous we'll probably still be doing this show out of

02:52:59.440 --> 02:53:02.360
our apartment and so I have to have a little bit of caution about you know

02:53:02.360 --> 02:53:05.880
who's coming in and who's not actually we don't want the paparazzi coming we

02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:10.920
We don't want the damn paparazzi in here. Which is really funny because we could have

02:53:10.920 --> 02:53:15.760
the paparazzi in here in the near future. Remember back in the day when we used to have

02:53:15.760 --> 02:53:19.400
all the people that listened to our show come in, they were like, why is our listenership

02:53:19.400 --> 02:53:24.600
down? I was like, because everyone's here. No, I don't see why not. I mean, let us know

02:53:24.600 --> 02:53:29.160
what time frame you'll be here. But in the future, I don't want everybody thinking that

02:53:29.160 --> 02:53:34.840
they could come. We are going to try and make more public appearances at conventions in

02:53:34.840 --> 02:53:37.160
the Bay Area and stuff. That's going to be part of our, like, trying to get our name

02:53:37.160 --> 02:53:41.120
out of that stuff. We almost did it this weekend. We were going to do RekkaCon, but I had to

02:53:41.120 --> 02:53:48.600
back out for other reasons, so. I'm sorry. Anyway. Um, so as, yes, you're special since

02:53:48.600 --> 02:53:54.280
you asked right now. You can visit us. Just, uh, send one of us an email. Either Rob or

02:53:54.280 --> 02:54:00.040
Jamie or Matt at orangelandtrader.com and we will hook you up. And it's loki at orangelandtrader.com.

02:54:00.040 --> 02:54:03.040
Matt auto-forwards to Loki anyways, it doesn't matter.

02:54:03.040 --> 02:54:07.040
I get a bunch of spam. A lot of people, a lot of spammers know where my address is.

02:54:07.040 --> 02:54:11.040
I think you can do darksaccharide at forwards to Jamie, which ends up forwarding to our other address,

02:54:11.040 --> 02:54:14.040
and you can do Rob or Skye, and I think it all works, but...

02:54:14.040 --> 02:54:17.040
Rob is what's on the business cards, so that's why I wanted to do that.

02:54:17.040 --> 02:54:21.040
No one sends me mail, except for the one time when, you know, they sent me mail because I asked for mail,

02:54:21.040 --> 02:54:25.040
but no one sends me mail, they're in spammers, and it looks like Matrix online today, but...

02:54:25.040 --> 02:54:28.040
Send Loki some email, you guys. Send him, send him some email.

02:54:28.040 --> 02:54:34.560
them some email. Honestly, I need to get rid of spam. I need a new email address. Alright,

02:54:34.560 --> 02:54:40.520
we'll see. Alright, it looks like that's all the questions we got for right now, so I'm

02:54:40.520 --> 02:54:46.960
going to close up the Ask Orange Lounge segment, so thank you guys for participating there.

02:54:46.960 --> 02:54:52.800
Angel reminded me to mention something funny that happened yesterday. We were playing DDR,

02:54:52.800 --> 02:54:55.800
because I mentioned I went to the bowling alley that's open 24 hours, and I was playing

02:54:55.800 --> 02:55:00.000
in the groove, and they also have DDR. And I don't know why, if it's just because I'm

02:55:00.000 --> 02:55:04.320
kinda... I don't want to say I'm bored with DDR, but I'm at the point where it's just

02:55:04.320 --> 02:55:09.120
like, I always just do roulette every time when I pick my song, because I guess that

02:55:09.120 --> 02:55:13.160
helps me get a break outside the box a little bit and play songs I wouldn't usually play.

02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:20.280
So I was doing roulette every time. And, um, for Extra Stage, I did it as well. I did roulette

02:55:20.280 --> 02:55:26.920
on my extra stage. Remember, extra stage is reverse 1.5 speed because I secretly don't

02:55:26.920 --> 02:55:31.600
like doing Legend of Max because I really can't pass it because I'm old and it's too

02:55:31.600 --> 02:55:37.040
fast and it's just too much for me. So call me a sucky DDR player, I don't care, but I

02:55:37.040 --> 02:55:42.240
can't pass Legend of Max extra stage. It's just too much. Too much stamina. So I do 1.5

02:55:42.240 --> 02:55:49.040
reverse and guess what song I end up with? BAG as my extra stage. And it lands on BAG

02:55:49.040 --> 02:55:50.620
and all I hear is angels start going,

02:55:50.620 --> 02:55:52.200
AH HA HA HA!

02:55:52.200 --> 02:55:55.380
AH HA HA HA! SUCKS TO BE YOU!

02:55:55.380 --> 02:55:58.620
I didn't know that, I said, NOOOO!

02:55:58.620 --> 02:56:00.420
You were totally pointing and laughing at me.

02:56:00.420 --> 02:56:03.900
The sad thing is, I actually did it, and I was kinda doing it for a little while,

02:56:03.900 --> 02:56:04.820
but then I was like,

02:56:04.820 --> 02:56:08.940
I'm too old, and I quit. I don't, I don't hold onto the bar or anything, and I'm not

02:56:08.940 --> 02:56:09.740
saying

02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:12.960
I'm against bar raping, I'm just, I personally am not a

02:56:12.960 --> 02:56:16.180
bar holder player type.

02:56:16.180 --> 02:56:20.420
Next time you consider bar raping, think of the bar.

02:56:20.420 --> 02:56:24.900
What did the bar do to you, huh?

02:56:24.900 --> 02:56:30.700
Anyway, I guess it's that time to start thinking about wrapping up this program.

02:56:30.700 --> 02:56:34.860
Thank you guys for tuning in tonight, and we hope to see you next week, but we can't

02:56:34.860 --> 02:56:37.700
end it until we get our final thoughts.

02:56:37.700 --> 02:56:41.500
Magus, your final thought.

02:56:41.500 --> 02:56:46.200
Needs more nachos, and possibly a little more cowbell.

02:56:46.200 --> 02:56:47.200
Angel!

02:56:47.200 --> 02:56:51.380
No more bag on roulette.

02:56:51.380 --> 02:56:53.140
Um...

02:56:53.140 --> 02:56:57.100
Uh, Nellie, do you have a final thought?

02:56:57.100 --> 02:57:00.540
Do you really want me to talk about the dead woman again? Sure. No, I'm just kidding.

02:57:00.540 --> 02:57:02.400
Alright. Loki, your final thought?

02:57:02.400 --> 02:57:09.400
Um, listen to the podcast where you'll hear more about my dog throwing poop on stuff.

02:57:09.400 --> 02:57:22.400
And Dark, oh my final thought, I'll let you have last. My final thought is, um, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball lickers. DarkSakura, your final thought.

02:57:28.400 --> 02:57:31.400
Do you know me? I am so famous.

02:57:32.400 --> 02:57:37.400
Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show. Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting and listening.

02:57:37.400 --> 02:57:44.400
Um, Magus, you get tonight's final word. One word to sum it all up.

02:57:44.400 --> 02:57:49.400
Veggies!

02:57:49.400 --> 02:57:54.400

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

02:58:14.120 --> 02:58:15.120
We did it all.

02:58:15.120 --> 02:58:16.120
We did it all.

02:58:16.120 --> 02:58:19.600
Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills,

02:58:19.600 --> 02:58:22.120
ludes, coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?

02:58:22.120 --> 02:58:23.120
That's what we did.

02:58:23.120 --> 02:58:24.600
People go, well why don't you go into rehab?

02:58:24.600 --> 02:58:27.060
We didn't have rehab back in the 70s.

02:58:27.060 --> 02:58:30.000
in the 70s rehab meant you'd stop doing coke but you kept smoking pot and

02:58:30.000 --> 02:58:33.260
drinking for a couple more weeks you know yeah give me a case of Budweiser

02:58:33.260 --> 02:58:36.680
on an ounce I gotta slow down Jesus Christ I'm out of control look at the

02:58:36.680 --> 02:58:40.100
size of my pants for Christ's sake

02:58:42.300 --> 02:58:46.820
that's the big thing now rehab is the big fucking secret now isn't it huh yeah

02:58:46.820 --> 02:58:49.020
you can do whatever you want just going to rehab and solve your problems and

02:58:49.020 --> 02:58:52.100
that's a big celebrity thing that's what I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna get famous

02:58:52.100 --> 02:58:56.440
then my career starts to flag I'm gonna go on a three-month fucking bender okay

02:58:56.440 --> 02:59:00.940
Coke and fuckin' pot and smack and fuckin' booze and drive over people and beat up my kids

02:59:00.940 --> 02:59:04.440
Go into therapy, go into rehab, come out of rehab, be on the cover of People magazine

02:59:04.440 --> 02:59:05.440
Sorry!

02:59:07.440 --> 02:59:08.440
I fucked up!

02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:14.440
That's what they do, man, they go into rehab and they come out and they blame everybody except themselves

02:59:14.440 --> 02:59:15.440
They blame their parents, right?

02:59:15.440 --> 02:59:18.440
That's the way everybody comes from a dysfunctional family all of a sudden, huh?

02:59:18.440 --> 02:59:20.440
Roseanne Barr comes from a dysfunctional family

02:59:20.440 --> 02:59:22.440
Not Roseanne, she seems so normal to me

02:59:22.440 --> 02:59:28.760
The Jacksons were dysfunctional, not the Jacksons!

02:59:28.760 --> 02:59:34.920
These people give each other new heads for Christmas, for Christ's sake!

02:59:34.920 --> 02:59:38.460
I am sick and tired of hearing that fucking speech, you know?

02:59:38.460 --> 02:59:41.880
These people come out of rehab and they always have the same story, well, you know, I became

02:59:41.880 --> 02:59:46.340
an alcoholic because my parents didn't love me, you know, and I became a junkie because

02:59:46.340 --> 02:59:50.420
my parents didn't love me enough, and I wanted the hypnosis and therapy and I found out that

02:59:50.420 --> 02:59:55.240
my parents used to hit me, hey, my parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay?

02:59:55.240 --> 02:59:58.520
And looking back on it, I'm glad they did it, I'm looking forward to beating the shit

02:59:58.520 --> 03:00:06.020
out of my kids, aren't you? For no reason whatsoever, what'd you hit me for? Shut up

03:00:06.020 --> 03:00:09.660
and get out there and mow the lawn, for Christ's sake. There's therapy for you, mowing the

03:00:09.660 --> 03:00:16.580
lawn and crying at the same time. The Leary kids in therapy again, their lawn looks great,

03:00:16.580 --> 03:00:27.060
unbelievable. I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy because my life

03:00:27.060 --> 03:00:32.460
didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Hey, join the fucking club, okay? I thought

03:00:32.460 --> 03:00:35.860
I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox. Life sucks. Get a

03:00:35.860 --> 03:00:44.900
fucking helmet, all right? I'm not happy. I'm not happy. Nobody's happy, okay? Happiness

03:00:44.900 --> 03:00:49.220
comes in small doses folks it's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm

03:00:49.220 --> 03:00:52.900
that's it okay you come you eat the cookie you smoke the butt you go to sleep you get up in the

03:00:52.900 --> 03:00:56.980
morning and go to fucking work okay that is it end the fucking list

03:00:59.940 --> 03:01:05.860
and just be a happy shut the fuck up all right that's the name of my new book shut the fuck up

03:01:05.860 --> 03:01:11.620
by dr dennis larry a revolutionary new form of therapy i'm gonna have my patients come in

03:01:11.620 --> 03:01:13.680
and doctor, I shut the fuck up next.

03:01:14.580 --> 03:01:17.820
I don't feel so, shut the fuck up next.

03:01:17.820 --> 03:01:20.140
He made me feel so much better about myself, you know.

03:01:20.140 --> 03:01:21.460
He just told me to shut the fuck up

03:01:21.460 --> 03:01:22.740
and nobody had ever told me that before.

03:01:22.740 --> 03:01:24.100
I feel so much better now.

03:01:25.780 --> 03:01:27.600
Whining fucking maggots.

03:01:30.300 --> 03:01:31.260
And all these people quitting.

03:01:31.260 --> 03:01:32.840
I think it's a good thing, AA,

03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:33.780
and the recovery and rehab,

03:01:33.780 --> 03:01:34.620
because I've got some friends

03:01:34.620 --> 03:01:35.740
who would be dead without those programs,

03:01:35.740 --> 03:01:36.980
but you know something, now we have a different problem,

03:01:36.980 --> 03:01:38.360
because now they quit drinking and drugs.

03:01:38.360 --> 03:01:41.460
They're completely stressed out and they decide to work out,

03:01:41.460 --> 03:01:43.380
Which is fine, I'm not a workout guy,

03:01:43.380 --> 03:01:44.980
but I understood Nautilus, it made sense.

03:01:44.980 --> 03:01:46.840
There were arm machines and leg machines,

03:01:46.840 --> 03:01:47.980
but have you seen these people

03:01:47.980 --> 03:01:50.140
who are using the stair master, huh?

03:01:50.140 --> 03:01:53.100
Have we turned into gerbils, ladies and gentlemen?

03:01:53.100 --> 03:01:54.860
People are paying money to go into a health club

03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:56.700
and walk up invisible steps over and over again

03:01:56.700 --> 03:01:57.700
for an hour and a half.

03:01:57.700 --> 03:01:58.520
Where are you going?

03:01:58.520 --> 03:02:00.380
I'm going up, and I paid for it too.

03:02:00.380 --> 03:02:02.060
I can stay here as long as I want, folks.

03:02:02.060 --> 03:02:03.060
You wanna go up and down stairs,

03:02:03.060 --> 03:02:06.100
move into a fifth floor, walk up on the Lower East Side, okay?

03:02:06.100 --> 03:02:07.780
What's next, a fucking chair master?

03:02:07.780 --> 03:02:09.420
I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up, I sit down,

03:02:09.420 --> 03:02:11.140
I get up, the door master, I open the door,

03:02:11.140 --> 03:02:21.140
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:02:41.140 --> 03:02:53.340
Sorry, I fucked up!

03:02:53.340 --> 03:02:58.260
Alright, a lovely fortune cookie as always from Dark Sakura.

03:02:58.260 --> 03:03:02.900
We are signing off, we're going to go back to our basic broadcast so we can go tape ourselves

03:03:02.900 --> 03:03:05.100
a podcast.

03:03:05.100 --> 03:03:09.060
Tune in next week boys and girls, actually you know what, just fucking tune in 24-7 because

03:03:09.060 --> 03:03:11.340
Because we got lots of cool shit on the station.
