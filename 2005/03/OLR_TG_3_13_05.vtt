00:27.967 --> 00:34.769
[SPEAKER_04]: Your home for all that news on video games that don't suck, and well, some that do, because it just sneaks in there sometimes.

00:35.209 --> 00:37.249
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:37.310 --> 00:41.491
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

00:42.611 --> 00:44.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Sakura.

00:45.352 --> 00:46.352
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakura.

00:46.392 --> 00:46.992
[SPEAKER_02]: Sa.

00:47.112 --> 00:47.632
[SPEAKER_04]: Sa.

00:47.652 --> 00:49.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.

00:49.653 --> 00:51.913
[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello also to Loki.

00:52.834 --> 00:55.974
[SPEAKER_03]: I am referred to as a tsunami to these gummy bears.

00:57.135 --> 00:57.655
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

00:58.120 --> 01:01.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've already eaten so many of them and taken their lives.

01:02.542 --> 01:02.882
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

01:03.983 --> 01:05.824
[SPEAKER_03]: Three pounds down since last week.

01:06.484 --> 01:07.384
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of gummy.

01:08.385 --> 01:09.545
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thrown up gummy yet?

01:09.825 --> 01:10.006
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

01:10.366 --> 01:10.706
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

01:12.207 --> 01:14.228
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into it.

01:14.448 --> 01:16.128
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of games have you guys been playing this week?

01:16.509 --> 01:17.109
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

01:18.830 --> 01:23.492
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little Final Fantasy XI, like maybe for ten minutes.

01:24.201 --> 01:26.362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I did some significant play earlier in the week.

01:27.843 --> 01:28.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Tekken 5.

01:30.045 --> 01:31.325
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to see all the endings now.

01:32.226 --> 01:34.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganryu's ending is hilarious.

01:36.108 --> 01:37.729
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

01:38.830 --> 01:41.652
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so a little more Tekken 5 for DarkSakura.

01:42.672 --> 01:44.113
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, er, sorry, Loki.

01:46.095 --> 01:49.817
[SPEAKER_03]: Parodius, I played that for a little bit on the main cabinet.

01:50.938 --> 01:51.438
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

01:52.125 --> 01:54.327
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the week was just Final Fantasy XI.

01:54.928 --> 01:56.869
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of Final Fantasy XI.

01:59.011 --> 02:00.152
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old theme going on.

02:00.192 --> 02:01.353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Parodius?

02:02.054 --> 02:02.354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

02:02.775 --> 02:03.115
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

02:03.615 --> 02:10.301
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Aliens vs. Predator last week, and I'll play probably another game, because I have to get my money's worth out of this cabinet.

02:10.802 --> 02:14.265
[SPEAKER_03]: And to put it this way, that's $3,000 worth of quarters.

02:15.166 --> 02:15.466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

02:16.709 --> 02:43.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to treat myself to some new video games this week so I went out shopping the other day and I picked up a copy of Zelda Minish Cap because I've been meaning to get that for a long time so I have that for my DS now and yes I know that Minish Cap is a Game Boy Advance game but you know what my DS is my Game Boy Advance right now because it doesn't need up batteries like the Game Boy Advance does because you just plug it in and all that so I'm loving the Minish Cap right now I think it's a great game I love the 16-bit

02:45.197 --> 02:47.079
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda game, of course, linked to the past.

02:47.480 --> 02:50.763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think that Minish Cap kind of invokes a lot of that old stuff.

02:50.783 --> 02:54.066
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cool thing is, they take a lot from, like, Ocarina of Time.

02:54.086 --> 02:59.252
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they take a lot of the music, they take some of the new enemies that were in there, like the Deku nuts and stuff like that.

02:59.312 --> 03:01.154
[SPEAKER_04]: They show up, but in 16-bit form.

03:01.474 --> 03:02.475
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think that's so cool.

03:02.515 --> 03:05.719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the puzzle element of turning small and all that stuff.

03:06.339 --> 03:06.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good game.

03:07.532 --> 03:17.720
[SPEAKER_04]: I also picked up, because it was only $10, because it's kind of an older game now, but I picked up a copy of Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, because I guess we just needed a new MMO to talk about on this program.

03:17.740 --> 03:21.423
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Jamie used to play PSO a long time ago, but you stopped, right?

03:21.463 --> 03:25.206
[SPEAKER_02]: My characters are still... I think I just hit V-Hard.

03:26.066 --> 03:30.630
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to help leveling, I've got people who'll help you level.

03:31.210 --> 03:31.471
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

03:31.731 --> 03:33.252
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and we've got stuff for you.

03:33.712 --> 03:36.314
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Al Rappi's, which you're not supposed to have.

03:37.702 --> 03:38.503
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe.

03:40.024 --> 03:44.246
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of liked Phantasy Star Online because it reminds me of a 3D Diablo.

03:44.266 --> 03:45.487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of why I like that game.

03:46.588 --> 03:47.508
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

03:47.528 --> 03:52.031
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about playing it again because I actually do have it for the Dreamcast, but I gotta cheat.

03:53.852 --> 03:54.393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do.

03:54.413 --> 03:55.954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way you can play games is to cheat.

03:56.194 --> 03:58.936
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think that cheating in MMORPGs is unethical?

03:59.156 --> 03:59.336
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

04:00.817 --> 04:01.097
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

04:01.590 --> 04:05.273
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll start off some gaming news tonight with some news about an MMORPG.

04:05.373 --> 04:08.615
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard said they were going to do this for a long time.

04:08.655 --> 04:09.376
[SPEAKER_04]: They finally did it.

04:09.396 --> 04:16.401
[SPEAKER_04]: They closed over 1,000 accounts related to gold farming on World of Warcraft and character sales.

04:17.482 --> 04:25.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard says, Over the recent weeks, we have been investigating the activities of certain individuals who have been farming gold in order to sell it in exchange for real world currency.

04:26.068 --> 04:29.671
[SPEAKER_04]: After researching the situation, we have issued permanent suspensions to over 1,000 accounts.

04:31.292 --> 04:32.753
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been engaging in this practice.

04:32.813 --> 04:39.537
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not condone such actions and will take decisive action as they are against our policy and damage the game economy as a whole.

04:39.997 --> 04:44.900
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 World of Warcraft players get in the boot, which should hopefully speed up some of those servers.

04:45.180 --> 04:45.841
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

04:45.861 --> 04:47.422
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this, Loki?

04:47.462 --> 04:50.864
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you have a strong opinion on buying stuff in-game with real money.

04:51.824 --> 04:53.945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem with it, but I think it's a good idea.

04:54.366 --> 04:54.706
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

04:55.367 --> 05:03.470
[SPEAKER_04]: That Square Enix is always threatening Oh, we're gonna do something You watch, one of these days we're gonna do something Well, didn't they ban like 700 people?

05:03.510 --> 05:07.872
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was more for harassing players No, it wasn't 700 people, it was 80 people I'm sorry, 80?

05:08.352 --> 05:13.714
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 people, 80, over the, over And this is over, like, you know, what, 24 servers?

05:13.754 --> 05:25.079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait a minute, I thought it was like 800 And then when you went across the number of servers there were It was like maybe 20 people a server or something No, it wasn't anything Weird And all the guild sellers are still there Oh, yeah

05:26.616 --> 05:29.537
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, any opinion you have on buying and selling?

05:29.557 --> 05:30.557
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't do it, honestly.

05:30.877 --> 05:36.418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just be all cute in-game and have people, oh, I feel sorry for you, here's money.

05:53.081 --> 05:56.046
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would like to be the equivalent of an MMO bum?

05:56.066 --> 05:56.987
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

05:57.728 --> 06:04.839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to stop selling my crystals so that I can make lumber and give people wood.

06:07.263 --> 06:07.704
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

06:09.299 --> 06:23.472
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking if you got desperate, you could start turning tricks and MMOs for De Niro, but that's what's already going on in Sims Online, from what I understand, is that Sims Online just turned into a giant Vegas, so that's why nobody's really playing it.

06:23.752 --> 06:26.274
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have emotes for that yet in Final Fantasy XI.

06:26.575 --> 06:27.696
[SPEAKER_04]: What, turning tricks?

06:28.136 --> 06:28.416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

06:28.516 --> 06:29.137
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you wait.

06:29.657 --> 06:32.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash Pizza was only the beginning for these MMOs.

06:33.427 --> 06:34.688
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

06:52.564 --> 06:54.305
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, here it is.

06:54.365 --> 06:55.006
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming true.

06:55.486 --> 07:00.589
[SPEAKER_04]: They've announced that the next console, the Revolution console, is going to have Wi-Fi.

07:00.889 --> 07:05.472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could swear this was just last week when I was saying it would connect to your DS via Wi-Fi.

07:05.492 --> 07:07.173
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be stupid not to put it in there.

07:07.253 --> 07:09.874
[SPEAKER_03]: This was months ago that we've announced this.

07:09.934 --> 07:11.615
[SPEAKER_03]: It was months ago that this was going to happen.

07:11.695 --> 07:16.158
[SPEAKER_04]: Also months ago, I mean... Well, we speculated it, but now it's official.

07:16.218 --> 07:16.878
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

07:17.158 --> 07:18.179
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew this was going to happen.

07:18.259 --> 07:19.019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

07:19.600 --> 07:21.541
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a thin line you've got to draw there, so...

07:22.958 --> 07:25.561
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly no big surprise there, but here's the other interesting part.

07:25.981 --> 07:28.844
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we've been speculating this for quite some time now.

07:29.304 --> 07:33.488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's announced that the DSs are going to be going online.

07:33.928 --> 07:42.617
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like you go into a Starbucks and you have a Wi-Fi hotspot type place, even if you have a hotspot in your house with Wi-Fi, now your DS can get on the internet.

07:42.637 --> 07:47.321
[SPEAKER_03]: See, but I thought those spots you had to pay for, or you had to have some sort of password to get into them.

07:47.441 --> 07:50.722
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Nintendo, now we don't know the details on this yet, so maybe this could change.

07:51.082 --> 07:54.343
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nintendo is saying right now this is going to be a free service.

07:54.603 --> 07:55.123
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

07:55.163 --> 07:57.143
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's just using the internet, it's already there.

07:57.523 --> 07:58.864
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess who's got Wi-Fi at home?

07:58.964 --> 07:59.344
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

07:59.364 --> 08:01.204
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to be able to use the DS on the internet.

08:01.504 --> 08:05.625
[SPEAKER_04]: Very first game that's going to support this, Animal Crossing DS.

08:05.805 --> 08:06.906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy.

08:06.946 --> 08:13.247
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes a lot of fanboys and girls of that game very happy because a lot of people have been saying since that game first came out,

08:13.991 --> 08:14.851
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be online.

08:14.932 --> 08:17.753
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget... And we were all in Animal Crossing.

08:17.833 --> 08:20.855
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all three of us were really all up on that game when it first came out.

08:21.155 --> 08:23.636
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, of course, was cheating on it to the best of his ability.

08:24.497 --> 08:31.360
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only utilizing an error that they made in their game programming, okay?

08:31.540 --> 08:33.421
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not use any sort of codes.

08:34.022 --> 08:36.123
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found a way to duplicate items, okay?

08:36.683 --> 08:38.844
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember like, hey, Jamie, you're going out of town.

08:38.884 --> 08:41.766
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me borrow your village so I can get your villagers to say shit and fuck.

08:43.342 --> 08:44.082
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

08:44.683 --> 08:45.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

08:45.783 --> 08:48.545
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, I was so mad when my town lesbian left.

08:49.085 --> 08:49.705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

08:49.985 --> 08:50.746
[SPEAKER_02]: What was her name?

08:51.046 --> 08:51.746
[SPEAKER_04]: Olivia?

08:52.247 --> 08:53.727
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Olivia was the pretty white cat.

08:54.308 --> 08:55.828
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, oh man, I don't know.

08:56.229 --> 08:59.891
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I remember I even made the sign to hang outside of her house.

09:01.327 --> 09:02.327
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you can make the signs.

09:02.347 --> 09:04.028
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you can make the signs.

09:04.048 --> 09:08.129
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be scared because you're going to have people vandalizing your towns and shit.

09:08.409 --> 09:09.970
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be crazy.

09:10.670 --> 09:13.291
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have animal crossing gangs.

09:14.071 --> 09:15.371
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kidding you not.

09:15.391 --> 09:20.153
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be flashing their gang colors and there's going to be gang signs.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.393
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to get tagged.

09:21.773 --> 09:23.994
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think... You're going to get hackers out there?

09:24.074 --> 09:24.715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

09:24.895 --> 09:29.577
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think, and I would hope, that Nintendo is already one step ahead of you in the planning of this game.

09:29.977 --> 09:33.159
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll make it... Because Nintendo's always been a very family-friendly thing.

09:33.479 --> 09:42.183
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't want any old person going into some seven-year-old's village and starting to make the townspeople say, you know, fuck me silly, you know, things like that.

09:42.663 --> 09:50.627
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would think that there's going to be something set up where you will have to grant permission to only trusted individuals to enter your town, I would imagine.

09:52.602 --> 10:02.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's screen name is going to be Free Candy Jesus Juice Do you remember what my island was called?

10:03.046 --> 10:09.008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like Big Tits or something And what was it like God, what was my town called?

10:09.048 --> 10:18.992
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like something cock It was like Big Cock or Monster Cock or something Big Cock, yes And note the great thing though is I am going to take

10:21.364 --> 10:23.785
[SPEAKER_03]: and shrink it down to the pixel size.

10:25.506 --> 10:27.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Goat Sam, I'm going to put it all over the place.

10:27.928 --> 10:28.668
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life.

10:29.288 --> 10:29.929
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life.

10:30.429 --> 10:31.049
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

10:31.089 --> 10:32.750
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be denied access to my village.

10:33.110 --> 10:39.514
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just going to... I can't even think of the implications this game is going to have.

10:39.634 --> 10:41.815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very exciting thing, I think.

10:42.315 --> 10:42.675
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

10:43.156 --> 10:43.656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be bored.

10:43.996 --> 10:47.238
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is coming out the day after my birthday or it's coming out the same week.

10:47.768 --> 10:52.549
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this was done to kind of one-up the PSP right before its launch date?

10:53.310 --> 10:59.111
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP said it's going to be online, but honestly, I think we're going to see that PSP is pretty much just Xbox Live.

10:59.832 --> 11:07.974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like this whole thing, DS versus PSP, has been like this big cock-waving competition where it's like, Oh yeah, well the DS is going to come out first.

11:08.214 --> 11:08.534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

11:08.854 --> 11:10.655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well the PSP is going to show movies.

11:10.915 --> 11:11.235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

11:11.535 --> 11:13.136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well the DS is going to be online.

11:13.336 --> 11:13.676
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

11:14.216 --> 11:15.337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, so is the PSP!

11:15.837 --> 11:17.678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, continuing, you know?

11:18.258 --> 11:28.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but where there's going to be 18 titles for launch on the PSP, 15 or 18, Nintendo's only coming out with like one game.

11:28.303 --> 11:33.405
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's really DS's weakness, but Nintendo, they've always been good at this.

11:33.725 --> 11:36.907
[SPEAKER_04]: When their game comes out, their game is just...

11:39.506 --> 11:44.550
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to do the Game Boy Advance 2 or SP2 or whatever.

11:44.570 --> 11:45.291
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Game Boy Advance 2.

11:45.751 --> 11:49.554
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because the DS isn't the Game Boy.

11:49.574 --> 11:51.255
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS is supposed to be the adult system.

11:51.355 --> 11:54.518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being marketed in Japan as the system for adults.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.243
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't get that impression.

11:56.303 --> 12:01.569
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be in Japan, but here... Yeah, because he knows Zookeeper.

12:01.669 --> 12:02.029
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

12:02.690 --> 12:03.811
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an adult title.

12:03.871 --> 12:11.840
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, actually, since it's basically just a ripoff of Bejeweled, I see tons of people that I work with wasting their day away playing Bejeweled instead of working, might I add.

12:12.981 --> 12:14.303
[SPEAKER_04]: So, something to think about.

12:14.443 --> 12:14.903
[SPEAKER_04]: Slackers.

12:15.064 --> 12:15.324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

12:16.656 --> 12:23.158
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Nintendo, they always have that one game that comes out that makes you have to buy their system.

12:23.519 --> 12:27.300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, if you have a moment, I'd like you to come over, if you can.

12:27.400 --> 12:28.260
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your microphone.

12:29.061 --> 12:34.422
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DarkSakura is probably the only gamer on the planet that has not seen this this week yet.

12:35.403 --> 12:38.864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the brand new Zelda trailer from the GDC.

12:38.924 --> 12:41.325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give a running commentary of what's going on in the trailer.

12:41.803 --> 12:43.264
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get Jamie's live reaction.

12:43.324 --> 12:47.486
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is the brand new Zelda trailer, which I know doesn't make for great radio.

12:48.086 --> 12:50.167
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll help you relive some memories here.

12:50.287 --> 12:51.488
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

12:52.568 --> 12:54.409
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, it starts off rating pending.

12:56.370 --> 12:57.170
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zelda.

12:59.011 --> 13:04.354
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Link looking all manly and swimming around in a very nice-looking water scene.

13:06.875 --> 13:08.456
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just some lighting.

13:08.776 --> 13:08.936
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

13:09.296 --> 13:10.497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Link saving a kitty.

13:10.557 --> 13:11.157
[SPEAKER_04]: He has kitty!

13:12.031 --> 13:14.192
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just a very scary statue thing.

13:15.373 --> 13:17.213
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more fighting at night.

13:17.373 --> 13:18.614
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Link riding a horse.

13:18.654 --> 13:19.654
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how great this looks.

13:19.694 --> 13:22.196
[SPEAKER_04]: And some, like, boar-looking creatures in the game as well.

13:23.276 --> 13:25.177
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

13:25.457 --> 13:26.017
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been.

13:26.097 --> 13:30.439
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been.

13:31.140 --> 13:32.320
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the skeleton creatures.

13:36.762 --> 13:38.643
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some more fighting in the underground.

13:39.543 --> 13:40.804
[SPEAKER_04]: Some scary ghost creatures.

13:41.624 --> 13:44.206
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear this is just like Ocarina.

13:45.046 --> 13:47.088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's like way better looking.

13:48.008 --> 13:51.530
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at this, riding the horse and fighting at the same time, fighting creatures.

13:54.692 --> 13:58.395
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, Goma shows up in every game.

14:00.216 --> 14:00.997
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more fighting.

14:02.117 --> 14:04.579
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there he is riding one of those boar-type creatures.

14:05.620 --> 14:09.182
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some fighting with a kind of interesting freeze effect.

14:10.788 --> 14:13.011
[SPEAKER_04]: When He Hits Something, and then of course the wolf thing at the end.

14:13.231 --> 14:14.533
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the new Zelda trailer.

14:14.553 --> 14:21.441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff that they took from Wind Waker as well.

14:21.621 --> 14:24.304
[SPEAKER_03]: So I noticed a lot of that stuff too that they have adapted from it.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.188
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the game they should have put out instead of Wind Waker.

14:27.548 --> 14:27.829
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

14:28.029 --> 14:28.790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been saying.

14:29.230 --> 14:29.691
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.

14:52.930 --> 14:54.454
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that was my reaction too.

14:54.835 --> 14:55.697
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure a lot of folks.

14:56.679 --> 15:00.608
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you guys that want to download the trailer for yourself, tons of gaming sites out there have it.

15:00.628 --> 15:01.871
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look around on some of the big ones.

15:02.372 --> 15:30.631
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not have a problem finding that, trust me Alright, let's talk about one other console real fast Sony, PlayStation 3 Rumor is they're going to show it next week But we didn't see anything yet Who knows, but we will be seeing it for sure At E3 in LA later on this year So that's all we know so far about what's going on with PlayStation 3 So they're kind of, whereas Nintendo and Xbox Are kind of showing off what they've got We'll talk about Xbox in a little bit

15:31.633 --> 15:34.454
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3's keeping some of it a secret.

15:34.474 --> 15:36.535
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard some of it, but not a whole lot.

15:36.555 --> 15:38.235
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3's got a lot under the hood.

15:38.315 --> 15:40.576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been hearing.

15:40.716 --> 15:43.177
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're basically keeping it under wraps.

15:43.257 --> 15:46.118
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, Xbox, look at what we can do in the PS3.

15:46.138 --> 15:48.018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, but look at this.

15:48.379 --> 15:49.519
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo yeah!

15:49.619 --> 15:50.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Served!

15:51.980 --> 15:52.340
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

15:53.218 --> 15:56.921
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to a segment called, well, do we have a name for this?

15:57.222 --> 15:59.904
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but DarkSakura, oh yes, DarkSakura's Advice Column.

16:00.444 --> 16:03.987
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura is going to better your life with some advice.

16:04.668 --> 16:06.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Useful advice.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very usable advice.

16:07.591 --> 16:17.879
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're feeling a little, you know, tingly after thinking about that Zelda trailer all over again, here's some of DarkSakura's advice to put you in a more clear state of mind.

16:17.939 --> 16:18.560
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.

16:19.121 --> 16:20.702
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is your advice column about tonight?

16:21.687 --> 16:24.508
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's piece of advice is how to control a runaway camel.

16:25.688 --> 16:30.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, hang on to the reins, but do not pull them back hard enough to stop the camel.

16:30.669 --> 16:33.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yanking on the reins can tear the camel's nose or break the reins.

16:34.549 --> 16:40.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, if the camel has sturdy reins in the head halter, pull the reins to one side to make the camel run in a circle.

16:41.671 --> 16:45.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, hold on until the camel stops.

16:45.891 --> 16:49.112
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether the camel is running in circles or straight, it will not run very far.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.677
[SPEAKER_02]: simply hang on until the camel slows and sits down.

16:53.838 --> 16:57.580
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know what my final piece of advice always is in these situations?

16:57.701 --> 16:57.961
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

16:58.281 --> 16:59.742
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get on the fucking camel!

17:03.565 --> 17:05.126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't get on the camel.

17:05.666 --> 17:06.086
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

17:08.548 --> 17:09.869
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that advice.

17:10.515 --> 17:14.196
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start a new segment here on the Orange Lounge Radio podcast.

17:14.256 --> 17:21.119
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been meaning to get into this for some time, but just recently we've been starting to get a lot of good emails on our feedback address.

17:21.179 --> 17:24.420
[SPEAKER_04]: It's togo at orangeloungeradio.com.

17:24.720 --> 17:26.441
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you want, you can send us an email there.

17:27.061 --> 17:28.721
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's our mailbag.

17:29.081 --> 17:34.243
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to answer an Orange Lounge Radio feedback email on this podcast right now.

17:34.303 --> 17:39.305
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to cue up some familiar feedback music here for those of you guys that listen to the three-hour show.

17:42.339 --> 17:45.161
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's dig into the Orange Lounge radio mailbag.

17:45.281 --> 17:54.008
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ken from New Jersey is writing us, I subscribe to your To Go because I normally don't have time to listen to your regular show all the time.

17:54.248 --> 17:55.569
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandable, that's why we created this.

17:56.129 --> 17:59.371
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have an iPod, so I thought this would be the next best thing, and it was.

18:00.192 --> 18:08.038
[SPEAKER_04]: It is good how you talk about games and all, and I enjoy listening to it in the car, but one thing I'm just asking or suggesting, could you guys please talk about music games more?

18:08.278 --> 18:10.980
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you have the name Orange Lounge, but I don't hear much on music games.

18:11.947 --> 18:17.612
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about upcoming events and things going on with the DDR music game community because I'd really love to hear more about it.

18:17.772 --> 18:18.813
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Ken.

18:19.414 --> 18:20.494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for the email, Ken.

18:20.775 --> 18:21.495
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.

18:23.197 --> 18:24.218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, what can we say on this?

18:25.282 --> 18:30.906
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio was started as a music game, rhythm game, and all that such.

18:31.947 --> 18:34.148
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything from DDR to Prappa the Rapper, 2DX.

18:34.788 --> 18:36.390
[SPEAKER_04]: Our station was really founded on that.

18:37.210 --> 18:44.435
[SPEAKER_04]: But as the station has kind of progressed over the past few years, we've kind of started evolving into wanting to take on the bigger picture.

18:44.895 --> 18:50.019
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is really kind of what we tagline this podcast with, the video games that don't suck.

18:50.479 --> 18:52.861
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to be the folks that are talking about, you know...

18:53.801 --> 19:07.198
[SPEAKER_04]: Madden, and not that these games suck, they're respectable games, but we just, we want to speak to those of a different gamer crowd, the ones that aren't, you know, necessarily playing those games that the media is shoving down your throat and everything, so, um,

19:08.197 --> 19:16.886
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have our three-hour talk program on Sunday nights live on OrangeLawnTrader.com, and that is the show that is dedicated still to music games and us as well.

19:17.226 --> 19:23.693
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe me, if there is really big music game news, we're going to mention it on this show because we always do respect DDR.

19:23.733 --> 19:29.859
[SPEAKER_04]: We did talk about the DDR with Mario a few episodes ago, you know, in the groove, having a home release and things like that.

19:30.719 --> 19:39.383
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that DDR itself hasn't had a whole lot of news recently outside of the song packs continuing to come out for Ultramix and things like that.

19:40.583 --> 19:48.807
[SPEAKER_04]: But believe me, when we get word of new console releases of DDR, they will be all over this podcast as well as on our three-hour show in more depth.

19:48.867 --> 19:50.227
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you want to add to that, DarkSakura?

19:51.408 --> 19:53.329
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really only so much we can talk about.

19:53.689 --> 19:57.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played poppin' music yesterday.

19:57.911 --> 19:58.151
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

19:58.491 --> 19:58.791
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

19:59.457 --> 19:59.737
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

20:18.385 --> 20:18.885
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

20:19.005 --> 20:22.786
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we totally understand your desire to want to hear about music games.

20:22.826 --> 20:26.688
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to, you know, disrespect you or anything because we really, really respect music games.

20:27.028 --> 20:35.971
[SPEAKER_04]: But just understand that the podcast, and this is for everybody out there, the podcast is really something that we're trying to make dedicated more towards those other games that we're into besides Bomani.

20:35.991 --> 20:41.432
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, we're always, always going to mention, because we're gaming fans first, Bomani fans second, really.

20:41.933 --> 20:42.753
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this is all about.

20:44.116 --> 20:45.196
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, enough rambling there.

20:45.236 --> 20:52.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if you have an email you want to send to us, togo at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, I didn't ask if you had anything you wanted to add to that, too.

20:52.479 --> 20:53.139
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, not really.

20:53.699 --> 20:54.739
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we kind of hit on it, right?

20:54.959 --> 20:55.580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

20:56.040 --> 21:02.242
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a story you had actually posted on the orangeloungeradio.com website where we do talk about a lot of general gaming news.

21:02.442 --> 21:05.723
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Next, or, you know, that's kind of the project name right now.

21:05.763 --> 21:07.383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also been referred to as Xenon.

21:07.423 --> 21:09.204
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what this is going to be called for sure.

21:10.524 --> 21:12.265
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the specs is coming out on this.

21:14.275 --> 21:15.115
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

21:15.155 --> 21:17.956
[SPEAKER_04]: You can read the specs on our site, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

21:20.596 --> 21:21.797
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting stuff.

21:22.357 --> 21:26.378
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenon CPU has three 3.0 GHz PowerPC cores.

21:26.878 --> 21:32.099
[SPEAKER_04]: Each core is capable of two instructions per cycle and has an L1 cache with 32 kilobytes for data.

21:32.399 --> 21:33.159
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah.

21:33.239 --> 21:34.339
[SPEAKER_04]: All this technical stuff.

21:34.719 --> 21:37.600
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, can you sum up what this all means here?

21:37.620 --> 21:39.040
[SPEAKER_04]: It means it'll look pretty.

21:39.780 --> 21:40.781
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, basically.

21:41.321 --> 21:41.881
[SPEAKER_03]: More or less.

21:41.981 --> 21:42.721
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just run.

21:43.390 --> 21:43.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Better.

21:43.630 --> 21:49.252
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're basically doing is instead of having one processor dedicated to everything, they're just separating it.

21:49.753 --> 21:51.173
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

21:52.554 --> 21:53.474
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

21:53.774 --> 21:55.855
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're wanting to build a camera into this.

21:55.895 --> 21:58.316
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that it will have a USB 2.0 camera.

21:58.356 --> 22:02.798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's capable of 1.2 megapixel still shots and VGA videos.

22:02.878 --> 22:05.259
[SPEAKER_04]: Photos can be used in-game for gamer profiles.

22:05.699 --> 22:06.900
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be built into it.

22:06.920 --> 22:10.841
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be like an attachment that's packaged with it.

22:10.982 --> 22:12.022
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt they would actually...

22:12.959 --> 22:14.359
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to people bitching every day about...

22:40.394 --> 22:41.635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a widescreen!

22:41.655 --> 22:43.736
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bars on top and bottom!

22:43.816 --> 22:44.956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it!

22:45.036 --> 22:46.397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because these people are idiots.

22:46.457 --> 22:48.118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are idiots, but you know what?

22:48.338 --> 22:53.440
[SPEAKER_03]: They make up most of the United States, and that's, sadly enough, that's what people are talking about here.

22:54.720 --> 23:01.003
[SPEAKER_03]: These HDTVs are not cheap by any means, and to be honest, I mean, you're really not missing much.

23:01.623 --> 23:02.564
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really not.

23:03.684 --> 23:04.305
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

23:04.345 --> 23:07.486
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, go out, buy the expensive console systems.

23:07.766 --> 23:08.907
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for example, I...

23:11.484 --> 23:15.265
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I got my CD burner from my computer the very first one.

23:16.105 --> 23:16.605
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent $300 on it.

23:16.625 --> 23:16.966
[SPEAKER_03]: $300 on a CD burner.

23:17.006 --> 23:17.726
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess how fast it was?

23:17.746 --> 23:17.926
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 speed.

23:17.986 --> 23:19.407
[SPEAKER_03]: I can buy a 52 speed burner for $50 now.

23:26.940 --> 23:27.681
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

23:27.961 --> 23:30.182
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell them at price for $25.

23:30.343 --> 23:30.803
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, $25.

23:31.483 --> 23:31.984
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

23:32.284 --> 23:34.406
[SPEAKER_03]: These TVs, thousands of dollars right now.

23:34.886 --> 23:36.607
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a year, they'll be not.

23:36.807 --> 23:40.510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just yesterday I was looking at Best Buy, these TVs, and I was thinking, my God, these are so expensive.

23:40.550 --> 23:44.153
[SPEAKER_04]: But by Christmas, I'll bet you that'll be the big thing they try to push this Christmas, is HDTVs.

23:44.453 --> 23:45.374
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll come way down in price.

23:45.394 --> 23:46.635
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's selling TVs now.

23:46.695 --> 23:48.236
[SPEAKER_03]: Gateway, Dell, that's crazy.

23:50.361 --> 23:57.852
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also along the Xbox Next, their next system, they're going to be changing up the dashboard in Xbox Live.

23:58.172 --> 23:59.655
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be built from the ground up.

23:59.835 --> 24:02.058
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're going to do a lot more of...

24:02.992 --> 24:05.873
[SPEAKER_04]: These like purchasing these items for use in game.

24:05.973 --> 24:09.174
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like pennies at a time, things like this where you're going to be able to buy stuff.

24:09.534 --> 24:17.037
[SPEAKER_04]: The new dashboard will have this prominent spot where it will feature slots for both games and also digital media you can buy through the Xbox.

24:17.177 --> 24:18.318
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be very interesting.

24:18.358 --> 24:22.119
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like they might be trying to make this new Xbox a multi-purpose console.

24:22.659 --> 24:23.820
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy movies online?

24:24.240 --> 24:25.481
[SPEAKER_04]: Bet you that's what they're going for.

24:25.641 --> 24:26.181
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see though.

24:26.321 --> 24:29.282
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I be able to hold it up to my head and talk into it like a phone?

24:30.370 --> 24:30.991
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

24:45.155 --> 24:49.178
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Xbox, you know they had a big game out last year called Fable.

24:49.758 --> 24:51.919
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, news coming out this week, let's make it short.

24:52.139 --> 24:53.900
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out for the PC as well.

24:53.940 --> 24:56.222
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be called Fable The Lost Chapters.

24:56.802 --> 25:01.945
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the title would make you think that it's going to have additional content not found in its console counterpart.

25:02.366 --> 25:03.106
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be correct.

25:03.126 --> 25:06.248
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be more quests, more regions, more story.

25:07.031 --> 25:10.574
[SPEAKER_04]: New armor, new weapons, da-da-da, all on your PC.

25:10.854 --> 25:14.877
[SPEAKER_04]: And that story kind of makes sense, because, you know, it was... Fable was pretty cool.

25:15.317 --> 25:16.558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd actually play it on PC.

25:16.798 --> 25:20.221
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten a chance to get really into it, but I think it is the kind of game I would pick up on the PC.

25:20.301 --> 25:26.025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I applaud Microsoft for finally releasing a game like that on the Xbox, because it badly needed it.

25:26.125 --> 25:30.348
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they had to program it in where the villagers would eventually kick you out of their town if you stayed too long.

25:30.829 --> 25:34.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before, you could have actually settled in a village.

25:36.273 --> 25:36.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

25:37.513 --> 25:38.534
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I like about that game?

25:38.955 --> 25:42.558
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the fact that you can be gay, straight, or bi in it.

25:42.638 --> 25:44.220
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually date men if you want.

25:44.500 --> 25:45.421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of funny to me.

25:46.962 --> 25:48.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

25:48.483 --> 25:50.005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like The Sims all over again.

25:52.335 --> 25:55.197
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a tour going around U.S.

25:55.277 --> 25:56.959
[SPEAKER_04]: colleges in March and April.

25:57.019 --> 25:58.480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be touring 25 U.S.

25:58.520 --> 25:58.980
[SPEAKER_04]: campuses.

25:59.020 --> 26:00.602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Game Live.

26:01.162 --> 26:07.187
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, they're going to be bringing a ton of Xbox consoles, plasma, and high-definition televisions to all these colleges.

26:07.888 --> 26:11.631
[SPEAKER_04]: California, Georgia, Michigan, Iowa, Washington, all these places.

26:12.571 --> 26:15.994
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's just an expo to try and get college kids to get sucked into these games.

26:16.014 --> 26:17.215
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll buy them, basically.

26:17.475 --> 26:20.558
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want more information on this, visit the official website.

26:20.598 --> 26:21.098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.

26:22.079 --> 26:25.741
[SPEAKER_04]: GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com

26:48.737 --> 26:49.898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, but it wasn't enough.

26:50.458 --> 26:52.640
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a Legend of Zelda.

26:52.660 --> 26:53.901
[SPEAKER_02]: It had Buffy.

26:54.061 --> 26:58.304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it did not have Katamari Damacy.

26:58.564 --> 26:59.065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

26:59.265 --> 27:00.806
[SPEAKER_04]: It still does not have Katamari Damacy.

27:01.486 --> 27:02.147
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to think about.

27:03.771 --> 27:06.936
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys, and we're going to call it a podcast.

27:07.336 --> 27:13.685
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC, there was a panel at the GDC, and it was studying the female gamer.

27:13.785 --> 27:18.933
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called, in particular, Counting Women, the Dollars and Cents Behind Female Gamers.

27:19.571 --> 27:20.651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:48.874 --> 27:52.575
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put everybody in a certain bin, but, you know, kind of the big picture.

27:52.875 --> 27:53.355
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

27:54.256 --> 27:54.816
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they need?

27:55.076 --> 27:58.337
[SPEAKER_04]: In your opinion, as a gamer girl, what do they need to do to get more women to play?

27:58.357 --> 28:02.738
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have more prissy frou-frou games, I guess, because I don't know.

28:02.918 --> 28:03.599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

28:03.679 --> 28:06.900
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely you can't suggest that we're going to have Barbie dress up.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.201
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm not really a typical woman.

28:12.221 --> 28:15.462
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into stupid girly bullshit, you know?

28:15.942 --> 28:17.863
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think for myself...

28:18.743 --> 28:27.208
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch TV at all.

28:27.769 --> 28:31.411
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go off drooling over whoever this cute actor is.

28:31.451 --> 28:35.374
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll think he's attractive, but I won't have obsessions about somebody.

28:35.834 --> 28:40.997
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Orlando Bloom, oh my poor thighs or something.

28:43.799 --> 28:46.541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Orlando Bloom does not give me the screaming thigh sweats.

28:47.552 --> 28:57.905
[SPEAKER_04]: Another interesting, and tell me what you think about this, DarkSakura, an interesting thing here, suggesting that the popularity of the eye toy, which sold, you know, well over 3 million units in 2004.

29:00.385 --> 29:04.769
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that was largely due to the female market and its attraction to the device.

29:05.209 --> 29:05.749
[SPEAKER_04]: You think so?

29:06.350 --> 29:08.672
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I always thought thy toy was pretty stupid.

29:09.212 --> 29:11.694
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that because women like to look at themselves?

29:13.495 --> 29:18.599
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I really do not, I guess, think like the typical woman does.

29:19.480 --> 29:20.601
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's why we love you.

29:20.861 --> 29:24.464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of the things that just disgust me in general.

29:25.685 --> 29:26.666
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand...

29:28.419 --> 29:29.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing girly things.

29:29.560 --> 29:30.781
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my girly moments.

29:30.901 --> 29:33.464
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people who were like that all the damn time.

29:34.184 --> 29:36.126
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my friend's sister.

29:37.587 --> 29:43.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was such an expert at Mac makeup by herself that they let her work at the counter.

29:44.793 --> 29:45.955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not kidding either.

29:46.575 --> 29:48.657
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a room dedicated to her makeup.

29:50.118 --> 29:53.101
[SPEAKER_04]: I know guys that could sadly probably run that counter as well.

29:54.142 --> 29:54.362
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

29:56.892 --> 29:57.392
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

30:13.819 --> 30:18.743
[SPEAKER_02]: are more attractive overall because, you know, especially things with customizable things.

30:19.163 --> 30:29.850
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have to say that my whole fascination with wrestling games is customizing the characters and making my own wrestlers and stuff and making them as violent and bloody as possible and designing their outfits while I'm at it.

30:30.811 --> 30:31.892
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little girly.

30:31.932 --> 30:36.895
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did kind of screw up my room on Final Fantasy, my mod house on Final Fantasy XI because I wanted to decorate it.

30:37.456 --> 30:39.777
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's, I have elements stylish.

30:41.659 --> 30:41.859
So...

30:43.557 --> 30:46.620
[SPEAKER_04]: and I can't wait to see your house in Animal Crossing DS, might I say.

30:46.760 --> 30:48.642
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw my house on Animal Crossing.

30:48.742 --> 30:49.002
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

30:49.142 --> 30:52.526
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the shrine to fire downstairs.

30:52.826 --> 30:53.206
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

30:53.526 --> 30:54.507
[SPEAKER_04]: That was hilarious.

30:54.828 --> 30:56.309
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Jamie's house in Animal Crossing?

30:56.329 --> 31:03.696
[SPEAKER_04]: You would go downstairs and then she had like the music playing and there was just this huge campfire, like huge bonfire.

31:04.056 --> 31:07.559
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of the Japanese artifacts in my downstairs room.

31:07.899 --> 31:09.501
[SPEAKER_02]: My upstairs room was like colonial.

31:10.390 --> 31:13.812
[SPEAKER_02]: and downstairs I had my bonsai collection.

31:13.852 --> 31:14.932
[SPEAKER_02]: I had every bonsai.

31:14.992 --> 31:15.993
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of the instruments.

31:16.013 --> 31:16.933
[SPEAKER_02]: I had taiko drums.

31:17.353 --> 31:17.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them.

31:18.734 --> 31:29.899
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the background a little CD player going... And I had the bonfire in the middle of my room there.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.160
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan had an arcade.

31:31.400 --> 31:33.481
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Animal Crossing is a good girl game, I think.

31:33.781 --> 31:34.262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

31:34.282 --> 31:36.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one of mine and Dan's friends...

31:40.103 --> 31:46.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Tina, she maintains our village that we don't play with anymore.

31:47.306 --> 31:47.827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

31:47.907 --> 31:48.307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

31:49.787 --> 31:53.909
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't think that I'm representative of the female market.

31:56.190 --> 31:57.311
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the best we could find.

31:58.331 --> 31:59.152
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm teasing.

32:01.193 --> 32:03.994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one who was begging for the whole Silent Hill collection.

32:04.794 --> 32:08.436
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that they would have more success with doing...

32:09.233 --> 32:19.978
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think that, and this is just in dealing with people that I know, a lot of the friends that I hang out with are a good bit more intelligent than the average American.

32:20.859 --> 32:24.901
[SPEAKER_02]: So they enjoy challenging games, puzzles, things that make you think.

32:25.701 --> 32:32.444
[SPEAKER_02]: But the average person in this country isn't going to want too much of a challenge because they can't handle it.

32:33.145 --> 32:35.406
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want something where...

32:37.009 --> 32:42.011
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think a sim is the best thing, I think, for the typical female.

32:42.592 --> 32:42.832
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

32:43.272 --> 32:44.192
[SPEAKER_02]: And the party games.

32:45.293 --> 32:45.753
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

32:46.033 --> 32:49.074
[SPEAKER_04]: Advice from our own female perspective there.

32:49.435 --> 32:50.055
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

32:50.115 --> 32:51.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me more Silent Hill.

32:51.275 --> 32:54.957
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't even have to pay $200 to attend a one-day conference to hear it, so there you go.

32:55.177 --> 32:55.817
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it for free.

32:56.618 --> 32:57.798
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up.

32:58.238 --> 32:59.719
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts, times, Loki.

33:00.719 --> 33:05.782
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be awesome if they put Martha Stewart as the playable character in Postal 3.

33:07.017 --> 33:09.838
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's so hardcore now that she's gotten out of jail.

33:12.459 --> 33:18.582
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, don't forget, we're going to be accepting submissions for the Kickin' Ultracade Machine Gallery that's going to be on our site soon.

33:19.162 --> 33:19.583
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

33:20.243 --> 33:21.263
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ride a camel!
