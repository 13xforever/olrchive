4
00:00:22,173 --> 00:00:26,957
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody out there in podcast subscribing land.

00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:29,859
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much for deciding to check us out.

6
00:00:29,899 --> 00:00:30,820
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.

7
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:38,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are, the Orange Lounge Radio podcast, dedicated to what gamers really want to know out there on the internet.

8
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my name is Sky, Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:41,628
[SPEAKER_02]: Join me as always.

10
00:00:41,668 --> 00:00:44,030
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie.

11
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:46,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what up, my homies?

12
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:49,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, and also say hello to Loki, Matt.

13
00:00:49,955 --> 00:00:50,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what's up?

14
00:00:51,664 --> 00:00:53,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Silent Hill 3, all day

15
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually been cheating.

16
00:01:08,677 --> 00:01:10,039
[SPEAKER_02]: What part of Silent Hill have you been in?

17
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:10,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still in the beginning.

18
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:11,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Silent Hill 3.

19
00:01:11,902 --> 00:01:16,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Does this have anything to do with the recent thunderstorms we've been having in the area here in Sacramento?

20
00:01:16,409 --> 00:01:17,410
[SPEAKER_02]: You call that a storm?

21
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,415
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but you know, for this area, it's a pretty big storm.

22
00:01:20,735 --> 00:01:21,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Weather wind.

23
00:01:22,536 --> 00:01:25,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, it was... It had really nothing to do with that.

24
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:30,200
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just we were playing with the... Trying to see if we were going to sell our Pro Action replay.

25
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,162
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just put in a bunch of codes and I was playing on Silent Hill 4 with the Heather beam.

26
00:01:35,082 --> 00:01:36,202
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, with the sexy beam.

27
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:41,465
[SPEAKER_03]: And with her magical transformation into Super Magical Girl Heather.

28
00:01:42,986 --> 00:01:48,108
[SPEAKER_03]: You get this wand, and when you equip it, you get a transformation sequence on top of that.

29
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:50,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

30
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,103
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

31
00:01:51,464 --> 00:01:56,348
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played... Silent Hill 3 is like... I played a lot of Silent Hill 2 and I played a lot of Silent Hill 4.

32
00:01:57,188 --> 00:01:58,810
[SPEAKER_02]: I somehow completely skipped over 3.

33
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,973
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how that happened, so... I need to give you back your 4.

34
00:02:02,013 --> 00:02:02,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I found it.

35
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:03,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you do.

36
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:04,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Give it back.

37
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,295
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all good.

38
00:02:05,956 --> 00:02:06,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't mind.

39
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:07,517
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's in good hands.

40
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:08,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, is that it?

41
00:02:08,978 --> 00:02:09,439
[SPEAKER_02]: Just Silent Hill 3?

42
00:02:10,587 --> 00:02:12,389
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Final Fantasy XI, though hardly any.

43
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:12,709
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

44
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:33,516
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I just thought I'd ask.

45
00:02:33,576 --> 00:02:35,117
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually sleep when it starts raining.

46
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:38,399
[SPEAKER_03]: There's two things that are guaranteed to put me to sleep.

47
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,581
[SPEAKER_03]: One is being a passenger in a car.

48
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:45,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other is rain, especially rain on metal.

49
00:02:47,066 --> 00:02:49,548
[SPEAKER_03]: So when it rains when I'm in a car, it's an instant coma.

50
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:54,331
[SPEAKER_03]: But thunder, rain, it puts me to sleep.

51
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,772
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't sleep in the thunder.

52
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:57,013
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in that.

53
00:02:57,754 --> 00:02:58,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I wake up too quick.

54
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:00,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki, what have you been up to?

55
00:03:00,035 --> 00:03:00,856
[SPEAKER_02]: What have you been playing this week?

56
00:03:01,954 --> 00:03:05,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing actually some different games.

57
00:03:05,675 --> 00:03:13,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than Final Fantasy XI, I picked up Gran Turismo 4 and a game called Dog's Life.

58
00:03:14,198 --> 00:03:15,099
[SPEAKER_02]: What is Dog's Life?

59
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:17,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is different than Nintendogs, which we've talked about previously.

60
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:18,680
[SPEAKER_02]: What's Dog's Life?

61
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:27,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Dog's Life is basically this game where you play a dog and you run around and do what dogs do, like sniff smells and, you know,

62
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:36,133
[SPEAKER_01]: Wait, so there's actually a button to crap?

63
00:03:36,753 --> 00:03:38,314
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's a trick you have to learn.

64
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:40,816
[SPEAKER_01]: To crap and fart.

65
00:03:41,594 --> 00:03:43,214
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great about the game.

66
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:45,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like learning how to throw a fireball in Street Fighter 2.

67
00:03:45,735 --> 00:03:47,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Just down towards punch.

68
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:49,456
[SPEAKER_01]: Something like that.

69
00:03:49,496 --> 00:03:53,197
[SPEAKER_01]: But this game, it's very interesting.

70
00:03:53,357 --> 00:03:55,117
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more kind of a collection game.

71
00:03:55,177 --> 00:03:57,177
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really kind of meant for little kids.

72
00:03:57,418 --> 00:04:02,179
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's weird, though, is even though it's meant for little kids, there's a lot of this really crude humor that's in it.

73
00:04:03,039 --> 00:04:03,719
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little odd.

74
00:04:04,259 --> 00:04:31,333
[SPEAKER_01]: but um the plot line is kind of seems like it's ripped from 101 Dalmatians a dog's been kidnapped by some woman named Mrs. Peach that makes dog food or something I don't know what exactly that's about but anyways um so she's kidnapping the dog and I haven't even really gotten that all I've been doing is running around in smell-o-vision which you can actually see the smells which is kind of neat you collect smells or whatever and then you get a bone or whatever and then

75
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:37,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can, you know, collect smells and race a dog and then you get to become this small little dog and run around.

76
00:04:38,153 --> 00:04:45,575
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just interesting, but one of the things I've been passing my time with is shitting, grabbing my shit, and then flinging it at people.

77
00:04:46,355 --> 00:04:47,055
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite fun.

78
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:48,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

79
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:54,217
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, I jumped on top of a van and took a crap and then just ran away and then, like...

80
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:56,562
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like small stuff like that.

81
00:04:56,782 --> 00:05:06,927
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, taking this out of context, like if we were to clip up the audio of this, and so you wouldn't know he was talking about a dog video game, that'd be quite hilarious.

82
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:09,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Very incriminating.

83
00:05:10,369 --> 00:05:11,790
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to save it for a promo.

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,970
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good idea.

85
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how's Gran Turismo?

86
00:05:15,131 --> 00:05:21,274
[SPEAKER_01]: Gran Turismo I played for about five minutes, just I played a couple of the arcade stuff, because I've been kind of mainly playing this dog game.

87
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,315
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, Gran Turismo...

88
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,980
[SPEAKER_02]: He's more into crapping on vans than driving them.

89
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:30,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I was playing Gran Turismo, and I had to remind myself why I sucked at Gran Turismo.

90
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:33,725
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maybe because I can't steer for shit in the game.

91
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:39,828
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, you start it up, and it starts playing this really opera-sounding music, and it's beautiful.

92
00:05:39,868 --> 00:05:46,872
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the graphics are really good, except the background and the audience, they're still 2D.

93
00:05:47,032 --> 00:05:48,673
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still flat and not moving.

94
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:52,095
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet the game boasts on the back that the audience reacts to...

95
00:05:53,414 --> 00:06:16,936
[SPEAKER_01]: like what you do and the only guys that are like a ooh ah type of thing or i saw camera flashes and that's about it i didn't see the audience moving they're just kind of looking like like um jerry blank's dad in strangers of candy that's a reference nobody's gonna get whatever that's why they have to watch the movie when it comes out all right but um so that's what happened there um

96
00:06:17,546 --> 00:06:18,627
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was really good.

97
00:06:19,027 --> 00:06:21,568
[SPEAKER_01]: The second race I did was on an off-road course.

98
00:06:21,688 --> 00:06:25,550
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have to mention beforehand, they recreated all the tracks from the first game.

99
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:26,490
[SPEAKER_01]: In this game.

100
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,071
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool, first off.

101
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:32,113
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like, I forget, 100 tracks, 600 cars.

102
00:06:32,673 --> 00:06:33,614
[SPEAKER_01]: You start off with 240.

103
00:06:33,654 --> 00:06:35,575
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like a ton to unlock.

104
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,075
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a ton of cars there.

105
00:06:37,235 --> 00:06:41,017
[SPEAKER_01]: The first car I played as was a Ford Focus, because that's what I drive.

106
00:06:41,457 --> 00:06:43,819
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to see how well of a race car that is.

107
00:06:44,059 --> 00:06:44,619
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not.

108
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:46,460
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I tried playing...

109
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,422
[SPEAKER_01]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

110
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:19,366
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, but I like it.

111
00:07:19,386 --> 00:07:22,547
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta, you know, get into playing it more, and if I get frustrated, let's cheat.

112
00:07:24,167 --> 00:07:24,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

113
00:07:25,048 --> 00:07:25,548
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

114
00:07:25,588 --> 00:07:27,788
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to hearing more about what you think about that game in the future.

115
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:32,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, myself, I'm still on the same games I was last week.

116
00:07:32,309 --> 00:07:34,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Phantasy Star Online and Zelda Minish Cap.

117
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:36,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been making a little bit of progress in both.

118
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:39,851
[SPEAKER_02]: I now have two characters at level 10 in Phantasy Star.

119
00:07:39,891 --> 00:07:40,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.

120
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:41,051
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

121
00:07:41,815 --> 00:07:42,816
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

122
00:08:02,327 --> 00:08:02,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.

123
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:05,649
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, pretty much just been playing those same games.

124
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:07,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Haven't had a whole lot of time to play any new stuff.

125
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:14,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides the fact I went to the arcade and I played, you know, some In the Groove, which is that new dance game that's kind of trying to take DDR's throne.

126
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:15,956
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

127
00:08:16,116 --> 00:08:17,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows what happens with that.

128
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news.

129
00:08:19,998 --> 00:08:24,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, what is on everybody's mind this week is the PSP is coming out.

130
00:08:25,182 --> 00:08:26,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'm too broke to get one.

131
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:27,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Bah humbug.

132
00:08:28,003 --> 00:08:29,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you say bah humbug?

133
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to be contrary, I'm actually getting one.

134
00:08:32,396 --> 00:08:34,956
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you're the lucky one that can actually get one of these.

135
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,457
[SPEAKER_02]: I, unfortunately, am too poor to get one right now.

136
00:08:37,497 --> 00:08:38,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody should send me a free one.

137
00:08:39,637 --> 00:08:40,358
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that idea.

138
00:08:41,998 --> 00:08:42,998
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, somebody should.

139
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:45,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.

140
00:08:45,139 --> 00:08:45,879
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to want.

141
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:46,999
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

142
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:57,662
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get your hands on a PSP, if you want to be one of the first, well, you have to live in San Francisco because actually at the Sony Metreon, they're going to have a midnight sale today.

143
00:08:59,441 --> 00:09:01,122
[SPEAKER_02]: 12.01am on the dot Thursday.

144
00:09:01,642 --> 00:09:02,542
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the other part of that.

145
00:09:02,582 --> 00:09:10,705
[SPEAKER_02]: For those of you guys that are too lazy to pre-order, reserve, that kind of stuff, the Metron is going to sell them on a first-come, first-served basis.

146
00:09:10,745 --> 00:09:14,446
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be interesting to see what kind of people end up camping out this week.

147
00:09:14,946 --> 00:09:20,207
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Best Buy is doing the exact same thing as far as... But not the 12.01 thing.

148
00:09:20,928 --> 00:09:25,329
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're one of those people, you have to be the first to own it.

149
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,260
[SPEAKER_02]: More power to you.

150
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your ass on down to the Metreon and do that.

151
00:09:29,441 --> 00:09:39,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they've definitely given you more to look forward to getting it first day because there's actually games out for it, whereas the DS, we're still waiting for games to come out for it.

152
00:09:39,904 --> 00:09:42,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of which, this was another news story I wanted to mention about.

153
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: The official launch of the PSP isn't happening until Thursday, but retailers are already selling the software.

154
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:59,048
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the thing, there's a restriction on the street date for the PSP, but there's no rules against distributing the software before the hardware street date.

155
00:09:59,509 --> 00:10:03,833
[SPEAKER_02]: People are out there and they are buying the games before the PSP.

156
00:10:04,254 --> 00:10:05,475
[SPEAKER_03]: They're at Fry's, I was there.

157
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:08,759
[SPEAKER_03]: They had Wipeout, they had Metal Gear, they were there.

158
00:10:09,022 --> 00:10:11,384
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those who don't know, Fry's is a major chain on the West Coast here.

159
00:10:12,064 --> 00:10:12,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Fry's Electronics.

160
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:13,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

161
00:10:14,706 --> 00:10:21,290
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of places I'm hearing are getting the game, so I don't understand why you would want to buy the game when you don't have the system.

162
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:27,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you want to oogle over the instruction manual, or you just want to hold the disc in your hand.

163
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:30,784
[SPEAKER_02]: and confirm that it's not going to play in a normal CD player?

164
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:31,865
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

165
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:36,287
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a smart way to build the hype, though, to go ahead and start making some money on it.

166
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, to have the display boxes out there.

167
00:10:38,528 --> 00:10:43,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I did think that they should have done like how they did with the Dreamcast, what Blockbuster did.

168
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:47,972
[SPEAKER_03]: Blockbuster had a deal where you could rent Japanese Dreamcasts and play Sonic Adventure.

169
00:10:48,273 --> 00:10:48,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

170
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:54,456
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, they had to send them all back, but you could actually rent just those two.

171
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:57,397
[SPEAKER_03]: They should do something like that with the PSP, I thought.

172
00:10:57,870 --> 00:10:59,037
[SPEAKER_03]: you know that would be a way to

173
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:01,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Let people see what it was like.

174
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they have the kiosks and stores now, right?

175
00:11:03,641 --> 00:11:04,882
[SPEAKER_02]: A few, yeah.

176
00:11:04,922 --> 00:11:07,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard some folks have played the PSP hands-on.

177
00:11:07,603 --> 00:11:11,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Some places have got demo units for the staff.

178
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:12,666
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, interesting.

179
00:11:14,267 --> 00:11:15,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the PSP is coming out this week.

180
00:11:15,988 --> 00:11:19,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there'll be plenty of news all over the internet about it.

181
00:11:19,070 --> 00:11:22,892
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just kind of waiting to get our hands on one, and we'll definitely give you our feedback.

182
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:27,334
[SPEAKER_02]: We will all have to share Jamie's PSP if she's willing to share next week.

183
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:28,855
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's actually Dan's PSP.

184
00:11:29,715 --> 00:11:29,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw.

185
00:11:30,075 --> 00:11:31,316
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to bring him next week.

186
00:11:32,216 --> 00:11:32,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

187
00:11:32,857 --> 00:11:33,757
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, steal it from Dan.

188
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:34,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever we have it, I'll bring him.

189
00:11:34,998 --> 00:11:37,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan can live without it for 30 minutes while we tape this podcast.

190
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:39,160
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

191
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:44,222
[SPEAKER_02]: Reminder, guys, if you ever have any feedback on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, you can send us an email.

192
00:11:44,302 --> 00:11:49,365
[SPEAKER_02]: The email address is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

193
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:53,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Since we talked about the PSP, let's talk about the competitor, the DS.

194
00:11:54,387 --> 00:11:56,828
[SPEAKER_02]: DS just rolled out recently in the UK.

195
00:11:57,088 --> 00:11:58,169
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, okay, you know what though?

196
00:11:58,489 --> 00:12:01,510
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird for me to call the DS the PSP competitor.

197
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:11,833
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a lot of folks want to say, DS, PSP, DS, and it's like a big fight, but honestly, to me, and that's the way I felt about the two systems at first, especially at E3, but to me now...

198
00:12:12,453 --> 00:12:21,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Both systems really are incredibly different, and they really both have different things to offer, such as the PSP actually has games on launch date.

199
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:26,020
[SPEAKER_02]: DS has, you know, the innovation touchscreen and all that other stuff, so...

200
00:12:27,044 --> 00:12:28,525
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard for me to compare the two.

201
00:12:28,605 --> 00:12:28,945
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

202
00:12:29,025 --> 00:12:31,085
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, is there a comparison for you?

203
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:32,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really.

204
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:36,327
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference between your DS and the great game launcher.

205
00:12:38,128 --> 00:12:39,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder if you can still shoot games out.

206
00:12:39,428 --> 00:12:40,509
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to twist it pretty hard, though.

207
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:43,109
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm curious about, if the PSP is still going to be a great game launcher.

208
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,270
[SPEAKER_02]: Remind us again about what was going on in Japan.

209
00:12:45,830 --> 00:12:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a failsafe built in so that you wouldn't hurt the games or something.

210
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:50,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Something or the other.

211
00:12:51,272 --> 00:13:11,860
[SPEAKER_03]: that if you got too aggressive with the system and twisted it you know sometimes, you know I used to do it all the time with the old game gear and everything with the Nomad sometimes you get so into the game that you twist it just a bit like if you're doing a racing game or something but if you twist it in that manner it would shoot the game out you'll shoot somebody's eye out with that thing

212
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:15,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, sorry, I just wanted to get that out there.

213
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get to the DS story.

214
00:13:17,402 --> 00:13:24,166
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually just launched in the UK recently, and it sold 87,000 units in the first two days.

215
00:13:24,546 --> 00:13:29,108
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes the DS the biggest hardware launch in the UK to date.

216
00:13:29,748 --> 00:13:31,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They are calling this over Nintendo.

217
00:13:31,629 --> 00:13:38,953
[SPEAKER_02]: The general manager of Nintendo UK, David Yarrington, says, "...an unprecedented success, breaking all expected sales figures."

218
00:13:39,488 --> 00:13:41,369
[SPEAKER_02]: and even exceeding our expectations.

219
00:13:42,049 --> 00:13:44,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Good news for the Nintendo folks in the UK.

220
00:13:44,911 --> 00:13:46,432
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if we could just get some damn games!

221
00:13:47,012 --> 00:13:48,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my Animal Crossing?

222
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:48,933
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's my Castlevania?

223
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:50,654
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it to me now!

224
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:53,055
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

225
00:13:53,776 --> 00:13:58,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, in DS news, this was a really big thing that was going around this week.

226
00:14:00,119 --> 00:14:05,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Apparently, if you look in the recent issue of Nintendo Power, that's what I'm hearing,

227
00:14:05,902 --> 00:14:14,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Under Namco's planned DS titles, you can actually see Katamari Damacy DS is being planned.

228
00:14:15,026 --> 00:14:16,087
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so cool to me.

229
00:14:16,707 --> 00:14:21,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I'm kind of wondering how you're going to control this, but you have any thoughts on this, Jamie?

230
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:22,790
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're a big Katamari Damacy fan.

231
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:27,452
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that Pac-Man Marble Madness game that they had at E3, trackball.

232
00:14:28,873 --> 00:14:29,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

233
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Do a trackball style with the stylus.

234
00:14:31,174 --> 00:14:32,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting thoughts, like a little trackball.

235
00:14:32,854 --> 00:14:33,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, all right.

236
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:33,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

237
00:14:33,955 --> 00:14:34,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki?

238
00:14:34,892 --> 00:14:37,313
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my thought, too, as well.

239
00:14:37,553 --> 00:14:45,777
[SPEAKER_01]: Either that, or you'd use the directional pad as one analog, and the four buttons on the other side as the other analog, sort of.

240
00:14:46,537 --> 00:14:52,060
[SPEAKER_02]: I was kind of wondering how the whole two-screen thing is going to work in Katamari Damacy DS.

241
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,842
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, is the top screen strictly for the King's package, or how's that going to work?

242
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:57,542
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

243
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:02,653
[SPEAKER_01]: No, probably be just, you know, stretched out, maybe a map on the bottom or something.

244
00:15:02,893 --> 00:15:05,334
[SPEAKER_02]: That's typical for DS games, have your little map on the bottom.

245
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:09,516
[SPEAKER_02]: But then again, Kanamari Namashi, you know, I kind of would have liked a nicer map in that game.

246
00:15:09,816 --> 00:15:21,302
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be kind of neat, though, that if you are using the buttons and everything on the normal screen, and then on the lower screen, as your ball gets bigger, you know how your field of vision gets bigger, your map expands.

247
00:15:22,242 --> 00:15:23,103
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that'd be cool.

248
00:15:24,514 --> 00:15:25,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Some good ideas there.

249
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:27,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what the future brings for Katamari Namashi DS.

250
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:28,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Very excited about that.

251
00:15:29,015 --> 00:15:29,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Very happy about that.

252
00:15:31,335 --> 00:15:31,835
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

253
00:15:32,655 --> 00:15:32,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

254
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:35,936
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in DS news, I have one other story about the DS.

255
00:15:37,616 --> 00:15:38,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick one.

256
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:46,138
[SPEAKER_02]: Majesco has announced that they're going to bring two new DS games out later this year, one of them being ATV Quad Frenzy.

257
00:15:46,698 --> 00:15:53,179
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, you know, four-wheel in action on your DS, 40 different tracks, and you can upgrade your ride using the stylus system.

258
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:54,931
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's got Wi-Fi support.

259
00:15:55,411 --> 00:15:58,073
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other game is Texas Hold'em Poker.

260
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,775
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just kind of going, do we need another poker game?

261
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:08,859
[SPEAKER_03]: To quote the best line ever from Mystery Science Theater 3000, the movie, well, whoop-de-shit.

262
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,288
[SPEAKER_02]: What is with the popularity of all these poker games?

263
00:16:14,368 --> 00:16:20,809
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I keep seeing all these cheap Game Boy and PlayStation poker games for sale at Walmart.

264
00:16:20,889 --> 00:16:22,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it just because of the show?

265
00:16:22,489 --> 00:16:24,430
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not just that.

266
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:31,691
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was at Fry's last night, they were selling poker tables, poker sets, just everything.

267
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:34,812
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it seriously the popularity of that celebrity poker or what?

268
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:36,632
[SPEAKER_03]: Poker is the new bejeweled.

269
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,738
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny you should bring up Bejeweled.

270
00:16:55,891 --> 00:17:23,631
[SPEAKER_02]: Banning Solitaire from computers and Minesweeper as well I'm not saying from every computer, you can do what you want in your house But from state computers and state offices like at the DMV, state insurance companies, things like that That's smart, disgruntled the DMV workers more But they're joking around calling this the country's first anti-solitaire legislation

271
00:17:24,926 --> 00:17:25,908
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just kind of thinking...

272
00:17:34,631 --> 00:17:37,952
[SPEAKER_02]: This has really become the new age time sink here.

273
00:17:38,272 --> 00:17:40,773
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, I see it happen at my company where I work.

274
00:17:40,873 --> 00:17:48,996
[SPEAKER_02]: I walk around and when people are feeling unproductive, I see Bejeweled and what are all those other games they have on like Yahoo and PopCap?

275
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:53,297
[SPEAKER_02]: The Insaniquarium I've seen, the Zuma is the other one.

276
00:17:53,357 --> 00:17:55,198
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't need to be working my job.

277
00:17:55,218 --> 00:17:56,678
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have time to be working.

278
00:17:57,559 --> 00:18:01,700
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're, you know, handling... When I handle something anywhere between...

279
00:18:02,952 --> 00:18:06,473
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 to 20 bankruptcy desk girl accounts doing their analyses by hand.

280
00:18:07,273 --> 00:18:07,953
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

281
00:18:08,453 --> 00:18:11,114
[SPEAKER_03]: They should have all of that locked out.

282
00:18:11,374 --> 00:18:18,095
[SPEAKER_02]: People that work in construction and jobs like that where you're not necessarily behind a desk probably get pissed off at these kind of stories.

283
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially in North Carolina where it's like, damn right my tax dollars shouldn't be going to people playing solitaire all day.

284
00:18:24,197 --> 00:18:25,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, doing it on your breaks, one thing.

285
00:18:26,237 --> 00:18:30,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And to folks at works credit, a lot of folks play Bejeweled on their breaks and that's cool.

286
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:35,221
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad that I can still check my school stuff during my lunch.

287
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:36,722
[SPEAKER_03]: But I miss checking my live journal.

288
00:18:38,383 --> 00:18:40,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, did you have something you wanted to share?

289
00:18:40,865 --> 00:18:41,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I did.

290
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:48,710
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to mention that Tuesday, or at least this last Tuesday, the Matrix beta has ended.

291
00:18:49,331 --> 00:18:52,913
[SPEAKER_01]: And I had to say they did it in a really interesting way.

292
00:18:53,994 --> 00:18:55,255
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, the...

293
00:18:56,693 --> 00:19:01,397
[SPEAKER_01]: The Matrix was being cleansed by a fire virus, so people started bursting into flames.

294
00:19:01,877 --> 00:19:04,419
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually, I have some other crap.

295
00:19:04,759 --> 00:19:07,281
[SPEAKER_01]: The sky turned into a bunch of eyeballs.

296
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:12,225
[SPEAKER_01]: And I actually have a video here for Rob to see real quick.

297
00:19:12,905 --> 00:19:14,846
[SPEAKER_01]: That is creepy as fucking hell.

298
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:20,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, you know, eyes floating around, the sky turns bright red and stuff.

299
00:19:21,011 --> 00:19:24,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, I guess at the very end of the game, once it was done, the

300
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:26,150
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

301
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:51,423
[SPEAKER_01]: It says, jack out now, discomfort will be extreme.

302
00:19:52,723 --> 00:19:53,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

303
00:19:53,283 --> 00:20:00,605
[SPEAKER_01]: There are signs in the club, like, time is running out, you are in violation, you are in violation, you know, you cannot hide, and stuff like that.

304
00:20:00,806 --> 00:20:11,068
[SPEAKER_01]: And apparently gigantic brawls were happening, where, like, some of the actual people from the game, or the movies, like Seraph and stuff, were fighting agents, and just nuts stuff going on.

305
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got, like, you know, there was... That is crazy.

306
00:20:14,049 --> 00:20:16,450
[SPEAKER_01]: Fire virus people catching on fire, it's just...

307
00:20:17,743 --> 00:20:19,564
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really interesting.

308
00:20:19,745 --> 00:20:23,208
[SPEAKER_02]: The Matrix Online folks got pretty clever with how they're going to end their beta.

309
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:24,449
[SPEAKER_02]: That was pretty awesome.

310
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:31,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine you're playing World of Warcraft and then suddenly your character just bursts into flames?

311
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:33,778
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really play the beta that much.

312
00:20:33,978 --> 00:20:37,501
[SPEAKER_01]: If I actually jacked in and saw this, I'd be like, what the hell is going on?

313
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:40,845
[SPEAKER_01]: There's beams of light shooting down from the sky and stuff.

314
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:45,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, your character literally just gets bent over backwards.

315
00:20:45,709 --> 00:20:49,472
[SPEAKER_01]: Sort of looks like the T-1000 getting shot with shotgun shells.

316
00:20:49,532 --> 00:20:50,012
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

317
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:51,193
[SPEAKER_01]: Nuts.

318
00:20:51,574 --> 00:20:55,177
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a really good sign, at least, of how the actual game's going to be.

319
00:20:55,217 --> 00:21:02,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if they're putting this much detail into the beta to bring up all the hype from this, you've got to wonder what the actual game's going to be like.

320
00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:04,545
[SPEAKER_01]: So that, I think, will be pretty interesting.

321
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to give my hands off to them.

322
00:21:05,866 --> 00:21:07,588
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty clever idea there.

323
00:21:07,608 --> 00:21:07,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

324
00:21:09,022 --> 00:21:12,145
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope this doesn't become a trend in MMOs.

325
00:21:12,465 --> 00:21:15,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Like on April Fool's Day, can you imagine some different MMOs doing that?

326
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:20,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Final Fantasy XI suddenly turned the behemoths loose in the middle of the city.

327
00:21:20,532 --> 00:21:24,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, that sounds like something they would have done on Ragnarok.

328
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:29,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, I had five wanderers come by and axe me.

329
00:21:30,661 --> 00:21:34,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in another time, I was lucky enough that I was high enough level.

330
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:35,405
[SPEAKER_03]: I was left with...

331
00:21:36,221 --> 00:21:40,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Six hit points after taking one hit from Wanderer and my ass ran like hell.

332
00:21:41,766 --> 00:21:47,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of World of Warcraft, you guys, just because I was talking about MMOs and stuff and we were talking about the various ones.

333
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:52,395
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Warcraft hit 1.5 million users this week.

334
00:21:53,656 --> 00:21:55,057
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's really all there is to say.

335
00:21:55,097 --> 00:21:56,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The game just keeps getting bigger.

336
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,460
[SPEAKER_02]: Won't stop going.

337
00:22:00,262 --> 00:22:02,444
[SPEAKER_02]: Meanwhile, I'm all getting back into PSO.

338
00:22:02,504 --> 00:22:03,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I behind the times or what?

339
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:31,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still apparently paying for it, I'll play Well you know there's some news coming out on the new PSO We'll be talking about that in upcoming weeks as more news comes out Alright, and of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio on the to-go edition We are not only interested in bringing you the gaming news you really want to know But we want to better your life And who better to better your life with some advice Than our very own DarkSakura with her advice column

340
00:22:33,652 --> 00:22:35,453
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what are you going to share with us tonight?

341
00:22:36,334 --> 00:22:39,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's tip is how to cross a piranha-infested river.

342
00:22:40,677 --> 00:22:42,238
[SPEAKER_02]: And how would one cross the river?

343
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, do not cross if you have an open wound.

344
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,621
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas are attracted to blood.

345
00:22:47,642 --> 00:22:54,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Number two, avoid areas with netted fish, docks where fish are cleaned, and areas around bird rookeries.

346
00:22:54,367 --> 00:22:58,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas may become habituated to feeding in these areas and may be more aggressive there.

347
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Number three,

348
00:23:00,336 --> 00:23:02,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay out of the water when piranhas are feeding.

349
00:23:02,499 --> 00:23:07,885
[SPEAKER_03]: When large numbers of piranhas are attacking prey, a true feeding frenzy, they may snap a bite at anything around them.

350
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,648
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see them feeding, stay away or well upriver.

351
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:10,648
4.

352
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:13,472
[SPEAKER_03]: Cross the river at night.

353
00:23:13,572 --> 00:23:18,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Virtually every species of piranha rests at night, and when awakened they will swim away rather than attack.

354
00:23:18,738 --> 00:23:20,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas are more active at dawn.

355
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:25,019
[SPEAKER_03]: Some large adults may hunt in the evening.

356
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:25,019
5.

357
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,980
[SPEAKER_03]: Swim or walk across quickly and quietly.

358
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not try to create a large disturbance in the water that might awaken piranhas.

359
00:23:34,402 --> 00:23:34,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Be aware.

360
00:23:35,882 --> 00:23:37,983
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas are freshwater tropical fish.

361
00:23:38,683 --> 00:23:40,704
[SPEAKER_03]: In the wild, they only exist in South America.

362
00:23:41,264 --> 00:23:44,025
[SPEAKER_03]: and slow-moving rivers, backwaters, or floodplain lakes.

363
00:23:44,145 --> 00:23:46,926
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas generally do not live in either mountain lakes or streams.

364
00:23:47,267 --> 00:23:49,027
[SPEAKER_03]: The water is too cold and flows too fast.

365
00:23:49,948 --> 00:23:54,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Piranhas generally do not attack humans or large animals unless they are already dead or injured.

366
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: During the dry season, however, when food is scarce, piranhas can be more aggressive.

367
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:06,915
[SPEAKER_03]: When driving cattle across a river suspected of containing piranhas, farmers will sometimes sacrifice a sick or injured animal downstream before letting the herd enter the water.

368
00:24:08,055 --> 00:24:09,576
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the final piece of advice, Matt?

369
00:24:09,856 --> 00:24:10,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh?

370
00:24:11,365 --> 00:24:12,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't cross the river in South America.

371
00:24:13,826 --> 00:24:14,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go near the piranhas.

372
00:24:15,728 --> 00:24:17,028
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have to, bring a gun.

373
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, dynamite.

374
00:24:22,231 --> 00:24:22,792
[SPEAKER_01]: Dynamite.

375
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:25,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for that helpful piece of advice.

376
00:24:25,593 --> 00:24:28,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Just in case I should ever find myself in a piranha-infested river.

377
00:24:28,875 --> 00:24:29,395
[SPEAKER_02]: Appreciate it.

378
00:24:29,796 --> 00:24:30,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll keep them coming.

379
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:31,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

380
00:24:32,157 --> 00:24:33,778
[SPEAKER_02]: From piranhas to turtles.

381
00:24:34,628 --> 00:24:41,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Melee is coming out on Xbox, GameCube, and PC.

382
00:24:41,912 --> 00:24:44,574
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually, it isn't coming out, it just came out this week.

383
00:24:45,955 --> 00:24:53,019
[SPEAKER_02]: It is by the same folks, by the way, who did Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix, the folks in Konami, Hawaii actually put this game together.

384
00:24:54,060 --> 00:25:00,704
[SPEAKER_02]: It is kind of, I guess if you really wanted to roughly describe this game, it's Mario Party with Ninja Turtles.

385
00:25:01,873 --> 00:25:08,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Not just the Ninja Turtles though, 16 other playable characters, Casey Jones, Shredder, etc, etc.

386
00:25:09,198 --> 00:25:10,979
[SPEAKER_02]: Rated T for teens, it's a budget game, $19.99.

387
00:25:11,079 --> 00:25:14,221
[SPEAKER_03]: It would make me happy if it has Usagi Yojimbo in it.

388
00:25:15,742 --> 00:25:17,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the list of characters, so no idea.

389
00:25:18,424 --> 00:25:25,828
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I think it's weird that there's all these Mario Party knockoffs, yet I have yet to play one as good as Mario Party.

390
00:25:26,108 --> 00:25:28,090
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have Mario Party Advance now too.

391
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:29,991
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw that store.

392
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:33,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about Mario Party 6, I'm sorry.

393
00:25:34,911 --> 00:25:38,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Sonic one, which I didn't really care for.

394
00:25:38,332 --> 00:25:41,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Crash Bandicoot one, which I really, really didn't care for.

395
00:25:41,854 --> 00:25:45,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I played the Namco one a little bit, which was eh.

396
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Just leave it to the folks who do it best.

397
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:52,237
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

398
00:25:53,778 --> 00:25:56,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, a little story on Halo 2.

399
00:25:57,876 --> 00:25:58,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is interesting.

400
00:25:59,638 --> 00:26:13,013
[SPEAKER_02]: On a Korean Xbox website, the official Korean Xbox website, it says, coming soon, and it calls this game the X-Pack, which is a Halo 2 expansion pack.

401
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:14,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

402
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:14,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

403
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:19,694
[SPEAKER_02]: No comment officially yet as to what this might mean for American audiences.

404
00:26:20,035 --> 00:26:21,375
[SPEAKER_03]: That means that Canada will get it first.

405
00:26:22,216 --> 00:26:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: But wouldn't that be interesting?

406
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:31,761
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you get all these people to buy this game, and a lot of people were saying that the ending to Halo 2 was a little lacking, unfinal.

407
00:26:32,441 --> 00:26:33,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Geez, surprise!

408
00:26:33,741 --> 00:26:38,544
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you gotta spend another $20 on the expansion pack to really finish the game.

409
00:26:38,884 --> 00:26:40,765
[SPEAKER_03]: I tell you, Canada's gonna have it before we do.

410
00:26:41,265 --> 00:26:42,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Because remember, they got the Crystal X-Box.

411
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:44,287
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that's true.

412
00:26:44,307 --> 00:26:44,507
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't.

413
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:46,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They get all their neat stuff there first.

414
00:26:46,923 --> 00:26:47,944
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.

415
00:26:48,224 --> 00:26:53,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Their Christmas bundle came with Halo 2 and some other really big game.

416
00:26:54,327 --> 00:26:55,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Where we got, what, two off-road games?

417
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:56,669
[SPEAKER_01]: I know.

418
00:26:57,730 --> 00:27:00,231
[SPEAKER_01]: FIFA, soccer, and some other thing.

419
00:27:00,451 --> 00:27:01,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Tennis.

420
00:27:02,841 --> 00:27:09,546
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, is this something that... I know you guys aren't really huge on Halo, but what do you think of this whole expansion pack?

421
00:27:09,826 --> 00:27:13,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Sucker America into buying the game and then release the expansion pack.

422
00:27:13,809 --> 00:27:14,670
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of interesting.

423
00:27:14,970 --> 00:27:16,651
[SPEAKER_03]: More fodder for my motion sickness.

424
00:27:17,172 --> 00:27:19,914
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't think of any other companies that do that, Maxis.

425
00:27:21,375 --> 00:27:22,175
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's true.

426
00:27:22,616 --> 00:27:25,038
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it's just part of the game.

427
00:27:25,078 --> 00:27:26,178
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 2, bust it out.

428
00:27:26,479 --> 00:27:26,899
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

429
00:27:27,566 --> 00:27:29,827
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I always assumed they were setting up for Halo 3.

430
00:27:31,127 --> 00:27:33,528
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be interesting if it's an expansion pack.

431
00:27:33,548 --> 00:27:35,709
[SPEAKER_01]: They're setting up for Halo 3, alright.

432
00:27:35,849 --> 00:27:36,649
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't doubt it.

433
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:38,570
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like Halo 2K.

434
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:39,691
[SPEAKER_01]: See, they're worried.

435
00:27:39,931 --> 00:27:42,372
[SPEAKER_01]: They're worried about one game coming out in that game.

436
00:27:42,972 --> 00:27:44,873
[SPEAKER_01]: Timesplayers 3, Future Perfect.

437
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:45,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, I'm sure.

438
00:27:46,453 --> 00:27:49,294
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, okay, that game has the oddest characters ever.

439
00:27:49,454 --> 00:27:50,375
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that game.

440
00:27:50,475 --> 00:27:52,515
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the only fan of that game I've ever met.

441
00:27:52,535 --> 00:27:53,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I also like Twisted Metal a lot.

442
00:27:54,396 --> 00:27:55,597
[SPEAKER_01]: I do love Twisted Metal.

443
00:27:55,617 --> 00:27:56,637
[SPEAKER_01]: That game rocks.

444
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:02,471
[SPEAKER_01]: I love the giant eyeball game where, you know, the sky eyeballs.

445
00:28:02,491 --> 00:28:04,232
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're thinking of Matrix.

446
00:28:04,912 --> 00:28:05,553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright!

447
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:08,014
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for this podcast.

448
00:28:08,034 --> 00:28:09,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for subscribing.

449
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:11,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts, Loki?

450
00:28:12,256 --> 00:28:17,939
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish all MMOs had giant red skies with eyeballs and lasers flying out of them.

451
00:28:18,479 --> 00:28:21,100
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's really missing from Final Fantasy XI.

452
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Laser beams on their freaking heads?

453
00:28:23,382 --> 00:28:25,243
[SPEAKER_01]: Laser beams and floating eyeballs.

454
00:28:25,283 --> 00:28:26,003
[SPEAKER_01]: But the floating eyeballs...

455
00:28:26,869 --> 00:28:29,611
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say, that's almost a ripoff of Lord of the Rings.

456
00:28:29,972 --> 00:28:30,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Almost.

457
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:31,313
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting close.

458
00:28:33,875 --> 00:28:41,521
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I'm very sad to hear that all my friends who saw The Ring 2 said it sucked, because I was looking forward to it.

459
00:28:42,542 --> 00:28:43,042
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

460
00:28:45,084 --> 00:28:46,445
[SPEAKER_03]: Dead puppies aren't much fun.

461
00:28:48,067 --> 00:28:48,447
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

462
00:28:48,607 --> 00:28:48,927
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not.

463
00:28:50,689 --> 00:28:54,712
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, folks, Robot Chicken, check your local listings, 11.30 on Sundays.

464
00:28:57,385 --> 00:28:59,968
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know it's being replayed throughout the week.

465
00:29:00,188 --> 00:29:01,129
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hilarious.

466
00:29:01,289 --> 00:29:02,290
