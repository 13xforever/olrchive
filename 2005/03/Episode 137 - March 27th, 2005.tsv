834	28491	Far too easily Save your tears, cause I won't come back I could hear that you whispered as you walked through that door But still I swore to hide the pain when I turned back the pages Shouting might have been the answer
29898	35383	What if I cried my eyes out and begged you not to pause?
38125	55961	But now I'm not afraid to say what's in my heart So a thousand words have never been spoken So fly to you, I'll be over the top
67623	72275	and a thousand words, one thousand confessions.
72295	75282	We'll create a field, making all the birds
106670	125239	Dream isn't over yet, though I often say I can't forget I still relive that day, you've been there with me all the way
145293	167987	But still I swore to hide the doubt when I turned back the pages Anger might have been the answer What if I'd hung my head and said that I couldn't wait But now I'm strong

194736	204929	Oh, a thousand words, a thousand embraces Will create a view, become all of your very days before

441539	444680	For this, March the 27th, 2005.
445441	447261	Yes, it's Easter Sunday today.
447861	449022	We are still live, though.
449062	451443	You'd think we'd have somewhere better to be, like church or something.
451483	455464	But no, we're here to provide you with three hours of entertainment on this lovely evening.
456425	457285	My name is Rob Roberts.
457325	458366	You might know me as Sky.
458626	461567	Joining me, as always, my awesome, awesome co-host.
461907	463608	In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
463888	465688	Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers.
465728	466609	You know her better as Stark.
466929	467269	Sakura.
467648	470530	Yeah, this is actually supposed to be a pagan fertility holiday, but oh well.
471770	474312	Blame those people in Italy.
476773	481456	Yes, DarkSakura, by the way, she's kind of the mother of the program.
481636	485098	She'll just tell it to you like it is, honestly.
485238	486759	But she does it because she loves you.
487440	488440	Don't let the attitude fool you.
488480	489341	Don't say the M word.
490582	493363	Some friends of mine and Dan brought their baby to our brunch.
493483	493503	I...
495860	497042	I need a hysterectomy
519246	522427	You know I've got to ask what you're building, but we'll talk about it when we come back.
522527	523187	Yeah, okay.
523387	524687	Are you going to do it on the cam, though?
524847	526188	Can they do it on the cam right now?
526308	528108	Well, right now I'm trying to make the mess.
528328	529128	Ooh, another one of those.
529649	532469	And I've been looking for this one piece.
532529	533549	He's piece hunting right now.
533569	539331	I have ten gallons of Legos, and honestly, finding four pieces in ten gallons is like a needle in a haystack.
539991	542691	I found three of the four needles, so I just need to find the last one.
542712	543332	All right, sounds good.
543352	544612	Did you find the marble and the oatmeal?
546676	550118	Say hello as well to our regular guest.
550939	556643	I mean, I can't say special guest because, I mean, damn, she's been here for like the past eight weeks, Nirvana.
556843	557763	She's a regular guest now.
557783	558384	DDR Angel.
559264	559625	Hello.
561046	561746	How you doing, Angel?
562466	562887	Pretty good.
563007	563787	It's wet outside.
564568	571032	Yes, it's raining here in lovely Sacramento where we based this show, but as Jamie said to me last week, you call that a storm?
571553	572093	Weather wimp?
573134	573294	Yeah.
573314	573634	Yeah.
574818	577823	Hey, you know, all I said was it was raining outside.
577843	578344	That was it.
578725	579687	I didn't say it was horrible.
579727	580288	It's just wet.
582331	582712	Alright.
583273	584175	It is wet, but anyway...
585317	612604	We're high and dry in here and we've got plenty of stuff to talk about tonight We've got some general video gaming news, of course your favorite segments, how was your week, how was your day We're doing a giveaway tonight, we're going to give away some stuff to a lucky listener So you're definitely going to want to be in on this and you can win a prize And that prize is not a 10 gallon of Legos No, it's not 10 gallons of Legos, it's something people might actually want And we're having another guest who's currently on his way with something neat Pie?
613185	614405	No, dammit
615165	616346	I can't eat this, though.
616666	618187	Yes, your fiancé is on his way, yes?
618347	619888	Yes, with a something.
620008	621049	I'm excited about this.
621069	621809	We'll have to talk about this.
621869	623290	It's his new appendage, damn it.
623330	625552	Except this is not for giving away.
625732	626012	No.
626192	626453	Yeah.
626873	627493	Hell no!
628394	628674	Alright.
629174	629595	Was that the door?
629615	630935	I don't know.
631816	635338	I'm... Oh, it's probably the Legos screwing with me.
635378	635719	I don't know.
636099	636379	Anyway...
640239	642501	We'll get to it right after a quick break.
642541	645963	Featuring some music this first break from 2DX Nightstyle.
646063	646924	Brand new game.
646964	652708	We talked about it a little bit last week, but I think a lot more people are starting to actually get into it and play it this week.
652808	655810	So we're going to celebrate a little bit by playing some music from Nightstyle.
656070	661654	We will tonight during the show, not this break, but a little later on, play the brand new consumer tracks.
661674	664296	We're going to premiere those here on Orange Lounge Radio.
664516	667698	And I understand we may have some new listeners tonight.
668079	669760	So hello to you new listeners.
670280	675203	And we'll tell you why that's happening, why we're expecting an increase in visibility, if you haven't already heard.
676184	678485	Very strange news.
679085	680666	It's exciting, but it's strange.
680746	686990	Strange things are afoot at Circle K. Yeah, strange things are afoot at Circle K slash OLR Studios.
688351	689392	We'll talk about that when we come back.
689412	697857	I'm sad if we have to broadcast from the Circle K. We should broadcast from the Circle K. I'm going to see you live from Circle K, and I'm not even supposed to be here today.
699409	701071	Alright, we'll be back after this.
701091	704395	We're going to start it off with some Ram with Act.
704876	707099	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1197373	1201695	Orange Lounge Radio is proud to present a celebrity interview.
1202555	1204196	Can you introduce yourself for our listeners?
1204656	1205496	I'm Miss Cleo.
1206036	1207637	Oh, it's great to have you on the show today.
1207977	1209117	Hello, how are you today?
1209617	1210558	I'm great, thanks.
1210738	1211758	Did you have a question?
1212178	1218081	Well, yes, actually I wanted to know... Can I please have your first name only and your birth date, please?
1219201	1223803	Uh, well, no, I actually just wanted to know what you thought of Orange Lounge Radio.
1224063	1224903	Alright, go ahead.
1225305	1228486	Well, what do you think of Loki, one of the three hosts of Orange Lounge Radio?
1228826	1229727	Is he incarcerated?
1230367	1231707	Uh, actually, no, he's not.
1231767	1234008	But what do you think of the ever-ranty DarkSakura?
1234168	1235449	Hi, dear, how are you?
1236029	1236749	I love you.
1236989	1238490	I see you two must know each other.
1238590	1239890	Well, what do you think of Sky?
1240190	1242131	Did he used to play football when he was in high school?
1242371	1243812	Well, actually, no, he didn't.
1245032	1246893	Well, what do you think of Intern Zero?
1247353	1250674	I want you to really remember the pill, all right?
1251204	1253166	I'm seeing some forgetting, possibly.
1253466	1256428	And I'm seeing a new baby in the next three months.
1257149	1257549	Right.
1257869	1260772	Okay, well, thanks for being on Orange Lounge Radio today.
1260932	1265976	Um, I don't mean to sidetrack your question here, but who are all of these nosy people?
1266236	1269559	Outside influences I'm seeing around you by the moon card.
1269719	1270660	Get away from me.
1273182	1278006	Orange Lounge Radio, helping to free your mind and spirit.
1278486	1279307	I'm Miss Cleo.
1279687	1280348	I love you.
1282611	1289037	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio live on this Easter Sunday, March 27, 2005.
1291539	1294002	Happy Easter to those of you guys out there who celebrate it.
1294022	1296404	To those of you that don't, happy Sunday.
1296544	1297505	Hope you got candy anyway.
1298866	1302250	We're here doing our thing here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1302770	1304632	Hello to anybody who might be new to our program.
1305313	1306514	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1325825	1326767	Thanks for watching!
1340478	1342599	So we went to the ceremony, and we lost.
1343899	1347420	It was a station that played porn music all day.
1347460	1349141	Yeah, it was a porn station.
1349461	1352702	It's certainly something you wouldn't hear on AM FM radio all day, so it makes sense.
1354263	1354803	So there was them.
1355523	1358624	So this year, we got nominated for that award again, thanks to our listeners.
1359084	1359905	Well, guess what?
1360365	1361465	We also got nominated.
1362766	1367507	I don't know how this happened, but we got nominated Broadcaster of the Year.
1368388	1369428	Us, Orange Lawn Radio.
1370086	1372148	And we have our personal ninja to thank for that.
1372548	1376291	Yeah, this little dorky station dedicated to video games.
1376511	1384257	Half the people on Live365 probably don't even... No, three quarters of the people on Live365 probably don't even know what DDR or Bomani is.
1385185	1385685	D.D.R.
1385746	1386666	is a type of Ram.
1407850	1410132	So we're definitely going to the awards ceremony again.
1410412	1415096	If you guys want to attend, we're going to post the information on their website.
1416257	1419820	There were not a whole lot of fans last year of stations.
1420280	1427847	So I think if we were not only to go ourselves, but to get other people, like a whole little entourage to be coming to the awards ceremony too, that would kick butt.
1428227	1434072	So you can come to the awards ceremony and you can watch Dark Sakura and I drink like we did last year.
1434092	1434712	So it'll be fun.
1435033	1435253	Yeah.
1436638	1438199	I need to just start doing vodka shots.
1438219	1440180	That way I'll be able to stay coherent longer.
1441041	1444543	Yeah, so actually we had a good time at the award show last year, so I'm looking forward to doing it again.
1444984	1447766	We're certainly not expecting anything.
1447786	1451468	We're nominated against some pretty powerhouse stations in Broadcaster of the Year.
1452889	1453990	Just some really good stuff.
1454030	1456532	Some well-respected folks in the community.
1456552	1462376	I think there's a really popular rock station and a couple regular radio stations that went to the internet.
1462516	1464177	I think there's an oldie station as well.
1464697	1465938	All really great stations.
1465998	1470080	So we're just like shocked that we're even in that category.
1470400	1476022	To take this station about video games and put it amongst these other four really, really great stations.
1476082	1477763	It's just like, damn.
1477883	1479084	We win at the internet.
1479504	1481145	We totally just won at the internet this week.
1481225	1482525	So we're very excited.
1483045	1484786	So thank you guys so much for your help.
1485286	1488808	Of course, if you want to vote for us, hey, we would love it.
1488948	1490029	So check it out.
1490069	1491049	There's a link below.
1491799	1502205	On our website, www.orangeontario.com, there's a link there where you can go and you can vote not only for the Broadcaster of the Year, but also most likely not to hear on AMFM Radio.
1502585	1508568	And I think we're up against the Pokemon Radio and, I don't know, there was a bunch of others.
1508728	1514311	The Pokemon one sticks out in my mind because I've played Pokemon and I have Pikachu dolls up here, so.
1515332	1516733	Anyway, that's kind of fun.
1517653	1519834	So, hello to those of you guys who are new to this station.
1520275	1520995	Hope you enjoy it.
1521610	1529593	This is the live three-hour show we do every Sunday night where we talk about not just music, video games, but really over the past two and a half years we've been doing it.
1529633	1536115	It's just mutated into a show where we're just kind of sitting around, a bunch of geeks that are into video games, just talking about what's up.
1536475	1539016	So we always start off the show by doing a little segment called, How was your week?
1539056	1539697	How was your day?
1540217	1541297	Where we answer that question.
1541337	1541677	What's up?
1541697	1542258	What's going on?
1542318	1544298	So we'll start off with the lovely Dark Sakura.
1544558	1544919	What's up?
1547039	1548000	My week, wow.
1548360	1548580	Well...
1548993	1550794	There wasn't really too much going on.
1550834	1553616	I did a lot of exercise because I'm training for the Mud Run.
1554596	1557898	I'm working out with Iguana Girl four to five times a week now.
1561641	1563502	Now, what is the Mud Run, for those who don't know?
1563942	1568525	The Mud Run, and I'll see if I can't post something in the chat room, like a map of it.
1569165	1571887	It's a military obstacle course set up by the Marines every year.
1572707	1576890	And the Marines do a five-mile obstacle course first, and then it's open to civilians.
1577630	1578831	They've opened up a two-mile course.
1590797	1593819	Does the winner of this mud run, do they win immunity?
1594539	1595319	No.
1595640	1603063	However, you do get a trophy, and it's a... You know how they do the bronze baby shoes?
1603103	1604384	They have a gold boot.
1605044	1607445	No bags of rice or fire for this one.
1608720	1612101	You know, and a phone call home, or a chance to go out on the boat.
1615082	1615622	Well, that's cool.
1615642	1616263	Good luck with that.
1616723	1617483	Take pictures.
1617583	1624685	We want to see, like, because we need to get bio pictures for the website, so we want to see a picture of you after this thing is over, just looking like hell.
1624725	1626006	I'll give you a picture of bio.
1626426	1627686	You guys have to come.
1627726	1628506	You guys have to come watch.
1628787	1629367	We'll watch.
1630737	1639644	See, this is the ironic thing that DarkSakura, you know, she may sound like, you know, she's nice and sweet and all that, but damn, she's the toughest one here.
1639804	1640505	I'm a big chicken.
1640545	1641946	I could never do that mud run, so.
1642506	1643287	I have chocolate.
1644328	1651894	See, I'm cheating like hell today because we went to Marie Callender's for their brunch like we do with a group of friends of mine every year.
1652554	1659340	Except there's some stupid drama going on now, so one person and then several more people didn't come because one other person was going to be there.
1660054	1664516	and then some friends of ours brought their baby, which convinced me never to, no.
1665996	1666216	Uh-uh.
1666496	1667117	I'll have chocolate.
1668477	1668837	Alright.
1671738	1673299	Thursday, Dan brought home his new appendage.
1674860	1675240	Which is?
1675480	1676000	The PSP.
1676700	1676840	Oh.
1677380	1679281	I want a PSP so bad.
1679341	1680342	I hate being poor.
1680362	1683943	You know, I was really down on the PSP for a while, but now I'm really into it.
1684463	1686824	Because it's got that nice wide screen on it.
1688064	1689365	The games look so much better...
1690561	1694464	Basically, you're carrying around a PS2, whereas with the DS, you're carrying around an N64.
1694824	1706874	You know, I really think that Sony took advantage of... Well, actually, I've heard that the PSP is about equivalent of Dreamcast power, as far as 3D is concerned.
1708570	1709631	You haven't played Ridge Racer then.
1709871	1714515	But the games, whatever the hardware is it runs on, the games look pretty.
1714615	1720080	I did check this out because I was over at your house on Thursday as well and I was checking it out.
1720100	1722902	They were playing Ridge Racer and dang, that game was pretty.
1723302	1727105	Like, it was so much better looking than I remember the PSP from E3 last year.
1727225	1728707	So that was pretty cool to see.
1729227	1730889	It was, it was, oh, thank you.
1731749	1732690	It was very cool.
1733311	1734371	I am very pleased with it.
1734732	1735592	I played Darkstalkers.
1735652	1737294	My one complaint is that
1737822	1739844	It hurts my left hand when I play.
1740344	1741225	That was on DarkSakura.
1741905	1743627	The analog button is so awesome on that one.
1744868	1748070	Did you happen to notice that on the bottom left there was just this little circle?
1748811	1752534	I totally... I was too entranced looking at the visuals on the screen.
1752574	1754135	I had no time to look at the actual system.
1754175	1755837	I was looking at it going, what's that?
1755917	1758019	And Dan's like, it's your analog stick.
1758719	1759600	It was really cool.
1759740	1762682	It's really easy to look over it.
1764264	1765425	At any rate, we've been...
1766621	1767702	We have five games for it.
1767742	1769603	We have Wipeout Pure.
1769883	1773766	We have Metal Gear Solid Acid, which is a strategy game, so I'm like, eh, on it.
1774747	1777749	Ridge Racer, that puzzle game, what was it called?
1778369	1778870	Lumines?
1779210	1780411	I want that Lumines game.
1780451	1780931	How is that?
1780971	1782993	Did you play that at all?
1783193	1783893	I've heard Lumines.
1784894	1789798	Something that, like, if you're into the music video games, you know, because it's by the guy who did, what, Rez and all that stuff.
1790438	1793060	If you like music video games, I hear Lumines is just the poo.
1793080	1794061	Well, I'll give it a try this week.
1796141	1800763	Well, um, I really, though, me, I'm a fighting game nut.
1800783	1802483	I had to play DarkSakura, so it was really awesome.
1803864	1805745	And the sound is really good on that thing, too.
1805785	1808186	It doesn't sound all tinny, like some things do.
1808986	1811327	Well, I should hope so, with Sony putting it out and everything.
1812107	1816489	Well, um, we also, though, found a webpage.
1816949	1817489	Can't hear you, hon.
1818089	1819430	We also found something on a webpage.
1819450	1820150	Well, Dan found this.
1821277	1821657	Wipeout Pure
1842105	1850086	Now I've heard that actually one big popular thing going on on the PSP right now is loading pornography on the memory sticks.
1850527	1853567	So you can have video with you to go, and of course people go straight for porn.
1854067	1861449	Well, um, they actually, we actually were looking for a one gigabyte memory stick, but they didn't have them anywhere where we went.
1862289	1863889	GameStop is supposed to be carrying them soon.
1864489	1869530	I want, if I were to get that, the first thing I'd load on, it would not be porn, it'd be robot chicken.
1871359	1873401	We put some video game trailers and stuff on it.
1874242	1877924	And Dan, of course, had to have some songs on there.
1878565	1890173	Like the two songs he really likes in 2DX, which is the one from Gradius 2, Burning Heat, and Twimmy.
1892255	1895477	And then I played a whole crap load of Silent Hill 3 yesterday.
1896678	1897559	So probably next week.
1897659	1898940	I cheated so bad.
1901544	1927477	and then we went to the brunch today and I got my graphics tablet yesterday too I have a Wacom Intuos I think it's gorgeous and it's so lightweight and it's like the perfect thing so I can sit back you know sort of half in my lap and half hanging on my keyboard desk and I can just draw it's awesome so I'm trying to practice how to ink a little bit and then
1928004	1938512	I sort of feel like I've been hiding out under a rock for the past three years, but I have finally discovered the universe of Gorillaz fandom.
1939893	1942375	And I've gone completely bonkers.
1944336	1946458	Are you talking about Gorillaz and the Mist, or what?
1946498	1948119	No, like the band.
1952663	1952983	All right.
1953964	1955125	Anything else you want to share about your week?
1955565	1956286	I had pizza.
1956626	1956866	All right.
1957782	1958362	Eat that pizza.
1958443	1959263	Loki, how was your week?
1959283	1959683	How was your day?
1960604	1961345	My week is okay.
1961365	1962185	All right, first, wait a minute.
1962205	1968750	First off, I hate to cut you off, but first off, tell us what the hell you're building over there with the Legos, which, by the way, you can see on camera right now, www.warnsonsradio.com.
1969031	1973474	Well, I haven't built anything yet because I was trying to find this goddamn piece, and I cannot find it for the life of me.
1973494	1976856	I have, like, eight of them, and I only found three, and I need four.
1977417	1979378	But because I'm smart, I'll make it work.
1979999	1985423	So now what I'm building is, and you can find the link to this on our website because I posted it there.
1985942	1988185	It's a Nintendo DS charging dock.
1989968	1991370	And it holds games and whatnot.
1992332	1995657	And there's a link to the instructions on our website.
1996177	1996938	Just check it out.
1998441	1999943	www.orangeloungerated.com
2000658	2003820	And this was posted on a bunch of different websites they had, this guy made it, and it's pretty nifty.
2005341	2008123	So wait, is it like with the iPod, how you have those little chargers?
2008403	2010544	It's supposed to emulate that, but for a DS?
2011144	2011465	Sort of.
2012225	2020330	Basically, the charging cord or whatever, it just sits there and you set the DS right on top of it, and away you go, and it has spots for games and stuff.
2020610	2026053	So I thought, because I saw the charger over there sitting there, I was like, you know, that'd be pretty cool to put one over there and just set a DS on it.
2027534	2029075	So yeah, that's what I'm building right now.
2029235	2030076	God, this hat's hot.
2031098	2031658	Thanks for watching!
2053877	2055138	Game Sales Position Game Sales Position
2076817	2087024	I've been playing a lot of God of War and some of this, I mentioned it last week, the Dog's Life where you can eat poop and throw it and stuff.
2087124	2087865	That's lovely.
2090467	2091407	That's all dogs do.
2091507	2097331	Well, I also got Gran Turismo 4, which I just remembered after I purchased Gran Turismo 4.
2097672	2098072	You know what?
2098132	2101034	I didn't play much of Gran Turismo 1 when I bought it, and guess what?
2101074	2103236	I haven't played much of Gran Turismo 4 when I bought it.
2103316	2104196	I have a remedy for you.
2104697	2104857	What?
2104877	2106478	Let me bring over the Logitech wheel.
2107849	2108089	Maybe.
2108570	2114013	And then I also got TimeSplitters 3 because I have all three TimeSplitters games now.
2114474	2117776	You gotta love a game where you can actually drive a cat.
2120197	2121658	So I love TimeSplitters.
2122299	2123319	150 unlockable characters.
2124380	2125901	God, I love that game.
2126261	2127662	It's just so much fun.
2128963	2129303	I don't know.
2129603	2131705	I think people don't really look at it as...
2132694	2134335	A very good... I mean, it's like a shooter.
2134375	2135515	Everyone's always looking at Halo.
2135535	2139097	But the best thing about this, it's actually an online game for the PS2.
2139257	2141318	So I've got to try the online mode with that.
2141579	2142359	It'd be interesting.
2143300	2144340	So that's what I've been doing.
2145561	2146381	Pretty much, yeah.
2146581	2147402	Alright, sounds good.
2148102	2149002	Oh, and lots of Final Fantasy.
2149303	2150483	Leveled my Black Mage to 56.
2151264	2152004	Congratulations.
2153085	2153365	Alright.
2155381	2168486	My week and my day, let's see, not a whole lot because we're looking for the new Orange Lounge studio right now or at least the one that's going to hold us over the next phase of Orange Lounge because as you know, Loki and I live together and that's where we do this show right now is out of this house.
2169166	2170827	However, we're moving out at the end of April.
2171837	2173198	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2194088	2197892	because I thought, hey, it's a nerd party, so I'm going to take my DS and we'll be able to do some wireless.
2198152	2199854	I was the only person there that brought a DS.
2200174	2205700	And then they were making fun of my carrying case, which is, yes, the same one you bought me, DDR Angel.
2207265	2210126	They were making fun of the carrying case because they said it looked like a makeup case.
2210547	2217550	So I was, you know, just messing around and I would open up the case, like pretend it was a makeup case, and I'd take out the stylus and pretend to be painting my eyelashes with it.
2217990	2221672	So, I don't know, I guess it's something you have to see, which doesn't work on radio.
2221692	2224433	But the highlight of the week was watching America's Top Model.
2224918	2234923	Yes, the highlight of my week was for the first time, I can't believe I've been missing this gem of a show on UPN, America's Next Top Model.
2235583	2238165	It's just a bunch of bitches fighting with each other.
2238225	2239365	It's so awesome.
2239385	2243767	But you've got to love a show that next week has flesh-eating viruses in it.
2243787	2244148	Yes, yes.
2244488	2245228	You've got to love that.
2245248	2248730	Seriously, I know there's a lot of hatred for reality TV out there.
2249350	2250671	But damn, is it entertaining.
2250971	2256374	And it's certainly more entertaining than turning on the news and hearing about that woman in Florida for the gazillionth time.
2256414	2257774	I'm so over her.
2257794	2261656	I forgot to mention earlier, I got some new movies, and I think I mentioned it to Rob.
2261936	2265278	We watched this one called Red Silk or whatever.
2265958	2293031	and it was the weirdest movie I've ever seen where these women were naked like the entire time and they were old and nasty looking and there was just like some weird dream sequences with like a kaleidoscope and stuff and it made no sense and you couldn't understand them and in fact I actually had to read the back of the box to figure out what the plot was because I couldn't figure it out from just watching it and then it's just really strange but then I also got this movie called and this is like typical fashion for me um
2294069	2307397	Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction Bloodsucking Vampire Rednecks That's nice.
2309058	2310419	I love bad movies.
2311919	2313260	Can I talk about my week again now?
2313320	2313680	Yeah, go ahead.
2315389	2320390	Uh, let's, so I went to the party, so nobody really had, um, a DS, so we were playing Super Smash Bros.
2320430	2325011	Melee, which is always a good time, and I'm so upset that they have not made a sequel to that game.
2325231	2327532	I mean, how can they have not made a sequel to Super Smash Bros.
2327572	2327652	yet?
2327672	2328672	I played that just the other day.
2328972	2331133	I'm, I, why don't they have something yet on DS yet?
2331333	2333053	Oh yeah, I forgot, the DS doesn't have any games.
2333893	2334833	Um, oh well.
2336254	2341155	So we played that, we played a little bit of Mario Party, which also needs to come out on the DS, although I guess they have a GBA version?
2341255	2341575	I don't know.
2341815	2342215	I don't know.
2342925	2347287	I'm so lost on the handheld loop right now because I'm all bitter because I can't have a PSP yet.
2348327	2348607	All right.
2349207	2350948	So that was pretty much my week of my day.
2350988	2352949	Nothing else that exciting going on.
2352969	2353909	DDR Angel, how about you?
2353949	2354249	What's up?
2355790	2357150	I played Bomani this week.
2357990	2358350	Ooh.
2358771	2361471	Well, it's a DDR and in the groove.
2361692	2361912	Yay.
2361932	2364633	You can see.
2365373	2366353	What did you think of in the groove?
2367834	2368674	We already talked about that.
2370078	2371039	Yeah, small arrows.
2371740	2375143	And then I noticed that, uh... How do I even say that?
2375223	2377785	Like, it starts off small and then it pans out kind of a thing?
2377865	2378946	You know what I'm talking about?
2379086	2380747	Like, the way the arrows scroll?
2381368	2382629	The weird scrolling thing it does?
2382769	2382989	Yeah.
2383229	2385011	Just call it the weird in-the-groove scrolling thing.
2385799	2387800	That makes no sense, and I'm like, damn.
2388580	2392201	You only see that, though, if you're, like, really paying attention to the arrows.
2392261	2392941	It's kind of funky.
2395041	2397662	Also... Let's see, what else did I do this week?
2398002	2403083	Oh, I got to play a different GameCube game this week.
2405244	2405564	What's that?
2406844	2407744	Star Fox Assault.
2408425	2409185	It's pretty.
2409825	2410985	It's Star Fox-y.
2412006	2412506	And, well...
2414830	2416551	I don't know, not too much else.
2418693	2420475	I need to find my Chains of Promethea discs.
2420575	2420895	Damn it.
2421335	2423357	Damn it!
2423497	2425319	They've sprung legs and walked away.
2427240	2427520	Oh well.
2427801	2430443	I guess it's telling me not to install it again.
2431223	2431944	If I can't find them.
2432484	2433385	Eh, I'll fix it.
2434386	2440391	I'll find some way to play again.
2440971	2441612	Because I need to.
2442777	2443078	All right.
2443098	2443358	Sounds good.
2459215	2467284	Don't forget, you guys, you can join our chatroom, www.orangelinger.com, click on chat, and we're going to have the Skype line open up a little bit later so you guys can call in and interact with us.
2467945	2472069	Just head on over to www.orangelinger.com, click on interact with us for all the details.
2472590	2475033	And as I hinted at the beginning of the program...
2475473	2487088	We're actually going to be doing a giveaway a little later on this evening, so you have to be either in chat or able to call us on the Skype line, because we're going to be doing a giveaway with Match Game later on tonight.
2487128	2493215	So we're going to have somebody on the Skype line versus somebody in the chat room, and they're going to be battling it out for a Resident Evil 4...
2494480	2499822	CD Sampler of Music, and the ESPN NBA 2005 soundtrack.
2499862	2505943	Now, I know we usually don't talk about sports games a whole lot on this show, but the way we see it, hey, it's free music.
2506143	2507084	So, what the heck.
2507544	2514346	So, we're going to give those away, and then we'll throw in a little something extra as well from us, the Orange Lounge Radio hosts as well.
2514386	2516006	So, get ready for that.
2516086	2520747	Don't send in anything in chat room or on Skype line just yet, because we'll be getting to that a little later in the show.
2520867	2521628	I'll let you know when.
2522268	2522568	Anyway,
2524072	2528773	Meanwhile, of course, as you know, we do this show based out of Northern California.
2529293	2532714	So we try to keep tabs on what's going on in the NorCal DDR scene.
2533034	2537315	We always like hearing from you guys what's going on in your neck of the woods via the Skype line.
2537375	2540375	However, we did have a large tournament that took place yesterday.
2541096	2542316	It's the March Madness tournament.
2542436	2547717	And I feel kind of bad because this is the very first year, I think, where I have not gone to March Madness, unfortunately.
2548117	2550257	I just had some other stuff going on that day.
2551538	2553018	But March Madness was going on
2553798	2555880	Freestyle was won by Thinner Mr. Wendell
2573955	2575997	DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2595715	2606038	And then I haven't seen where the Perfect Attack scores are, but I'm trying to dig through the thread right here, trying to figure out what's going on, looking at the wrap-up over on DDR Freak.
2607659	2612520	The winner was Billy Jr., it looks like, for Perfect Attack, with second place, Chaos.
2613100	2615781	The last round, Max Shuffle.
2618143	2618703	Very interesting.
2619043	2620164	But this is the interesting part.
2620704	2623205	Only 24 people entered Perfect Attack this year.
2623726	2627607	Which is kind of... Yeah, it's kind of a little bit down from where it was previously.
2627687	2629888	So I really feel bad that I wasn't able to go.
2630609	2631569	I just had other stuff going on.
2631609	2635751	But is this a sign that the DDR tournaments are running out of steam?
2635991	2636511	What do you think?
2636752	2638472	I mean, Jamie, you've won a lot of DDR tournaments.
2638492	2640093	Do you think it's starting to run out of steam or what's up?
2640193	2640793	Honestly, yeah.
2641694	2646336	I don't... I mean, I'm kind of sad that I missed out on going to this one, but...
2648228	2649009	Thanks for watching!
2667708	2668108	Thanks for watching!
2691804	2697968	Dance Gaming Community as it is, so I think a lot of folks, you know, if they're not in the groove, they're not going to check out one of these tournaments.
2698048	2700330	So, I don't know, it's just kind of too bad.
2700650	2708135	I hope it's not a sign that DDR is dying in the arcades, but at the same time, without new DDR, the heck are we supposed to do?
2709156	2709456	I don't know.
2710316	2713639	People are coming up with clever ideas, though, to keep it fresh, so, you know, hats off to them.
2714779	2716300	Loki, any thoughts on the tournament?
2719624	2741803	I don't know, I haven't been in a tournament in a long time, it's just not my thing, I don't know I think a lot of people are just, I don't know, just tournaments Maybe because the crowd that's getting into it now is more new at it or something And that's why they feel maybe a little intimidated to go up against these people
2743732	2744633	Maybe that's my guess.
2744833	2749896	Or the fact that these people that are coming in are getting introduced to it on the home console.
2749916	2757922	Maybe they're just not really getting into it with the environment, like the crowd and stuff, as they would if they started off in the arcade.
2757942	2759704	I don't know.
2759764	2760304	That's my guess.
2761792	2763352	Yeah, I think it's just kind of too bad.
2763452	2766993	I mean, that it's just not the huge thing it was.
2767373	2772914	And you're right, maybe a lot of that is because people are starting on the home mixes now.
2774015	2779736	But I'm surprised that I don't see more, if that's the case, more of these tournaments that are conducted on home mixes.
2781016	2783777	But maybe that's because of the fact that...
2786751	2791412	Maybe that's because of the fact that it's kind of harder to run a fair tournament on home mixes.
2791652	2792613	I don't know, what do you guys think?
2793053	2796034	Do you think it's possible to run a fair tournament on home mixes with home pads and stuff?
2796074	2798014	Absolutely, we did it at Shaft.
2799074	2803595	When we had to do a quick fix, we pulled out modded pads and he won second place.
2803936	2804656	Yeah, that's true.
2807825	2811567	By the way, the fiancé of DarkSakura has just joined us.
2811747	2812947	Dan the Man is back.
2813227	2814848	You may remember him from a couple weeks ago.
2814908	2819630	He was here telling you guys to go buy ignition pads at his local GameStop.
2820050	2821791	My second legendary appearance.
2821911	2822111	Yes.
2822311	2823412	So did it work?
2823452	2824292	Did anybody buy any?
2824733	2825193	Hell no.
2825413	2825813	Damn.
2826333	2827514	Nobody buys the ignition pads.
2827814	2828374	That's too bad to hear.
2828394	2829455	I think we sold one.
2829475	2830895	Oh, that was from us.
2830915	2835937	So to replace it, they sent me two cheap GameStop brand knockoff ignition pads.
2836057	2836498	Oh, hooray.
2836538	2837018	Fuck y'all.
2838640	2842044	Alright, now you brought a treat to show us here in studio tonight, correct?
2843506	2844047	Uh, yeah.
2844507	2844968	What's that?
2846009	2846590	My pants.
2848192	2848673	Hooray!
2851869	2852890	No, really, what did you bring?
2854230	2855531	Is that a PSP?
2855551	2856532	We've got to put that on cam.
2856612	2860314	So we'll be showing that on cam during the break so you guys can see how pretty it is.
2860334	2864937	Let's try to get some of the music on it if we can get the speakers to pick it up.
2865237	2867798	We might be able to do something where we can hook it into the mixing board.
2868319	2869079	We'll see what we can do.
2869379	2870840	It's got USB connection on it.
2871441	2871841	Oh, right on.
2872641	2872881	Wow.
2873542	2873802	All right.
2874093	2875315	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2889273	2891275	So we'll be back after this next break.
2891435	2895759	In this next break, we're actually going to play some music from 2DX Night Style.
2896079	2898841	But this is brand new music from the home version.
2899042	2900403	We call these consumer tracks.
2900843	2904446	So when they are songs specifically made for the home release of the game.
2904786	2907088	So we're going to hear some brand new 2DX Night Style songs.
2907108	2909611	We're going to start it off with a brand new LED song.
2909991	2911292	It's called Photogenic.
2911752	2913694	So enjoy this and three other songs.
2914255	2915596	And we'll be back after this.
2918323	2919503	DarkSakura.com
2947985	2952213	So I come into the world to be someone Taking you to the place with you
2980393	2980914	and many more.
3008687	3009348	Thanks for watching!
3068983	3070125	Thank you for watching!
3103234	3104539	Thanks for watching!
3154558	3159841	Come join our party, see how we play
3196878	3199760	Hatsune Miku Hatsune Miku Hatsune Miku
3240075	3241458	Thank you for watching!
3265925	3266806	Thank you for watching!
3389193	3398553	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
3399302	3403386	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
3403426	3404387	Can we talk about that?
3404667	3407029	No subject will ever be taboo.
3407290	3410933	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
3411453	3413996	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
3414516	3419881	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
3420442	3421723	I collect your fucking head.
3423678	3425158	Just like this fucker here.
3426259	3429940	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
3430240	3433601	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
3434541	3440982	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
3442223	3445924	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
3449787	3452169	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3452209	3453411	Hope you enjoyed that break.
3453451	3456774	Some brand new music we're playing on Orange Lounge Radio for the first time.
3457194	3460417	Some tracks from 2DX Night Style, the consumer version.
3460918	3461799	We had a night break.
3461839	3463901	We had some LED with Photogenic.
3465162	3468005	Ota 2 with Usual Days, a remix there.
3468675	3496177	Gupperslope with 80's Capsule and the brand new Jaeger remix which I guess is to complete some type of trilogy or something going on there so I don't know how I feel about that new Jaeger remix though because it sounds to me like it's the hamster dance they need the Jaeger Meister mix now now that would be awesome but the video is kind of cool so what can you do about that all the strong Jaeger ones are pretty cool alright alright
3496866	3499354	So what we're going to do now is we actually are going to take...
3500032	3500632	I call that my influence.
3530692	3531855	As the resident female.
3531896	3532617	Yeah, I know, that's fine.
3532637	3533640	I can change anything I want.
3533720	3535144	As the resident moody female, yes.
3535706	3536107	Moody?
3536829	3537651	Just, love ya.
3538072	3538333	Alright.
3539036	3546380	So what we're going to do, actually, is we also had, just recently come out within this past week, we had Service Pack... I'm sorry, I keep calling these things Service Pack.
3546460	3550362	Song Pack 9 just came out for DDR Ultramix 2.
3551043	3560788	So what we're going to do is we're actually going to have Loki play some of these songs on air, and he's going to give us his feedback to the steps to these songs live as he dances to them.
3560968	3565170	This is our excuse because they think I'm too fat, and so they said, you've got to work, you've got to exercise.
3565230	3568032	Loki has to dance because he is the pudgiest.
3568252	3568432	Hey!
3569192	3571775	That's not fair.
3571895	3572615	It's the bacon.
3572956	3573876	It's basically what it is.
3573956	3574137	Yes.
3574477	3574777	All right.
3575758	3580262	So what we're going to do... We weren't able to set this up to do on Xbox Live, huh?
3580282	3584725	Because we have our... Well... You want to set it up on Xbox?
3584805	3585086	Nah.
3585286	3586667	Don't take too long to get an opponent.
3586687	3587207	Forget it.
3587428	3587708	Forget it.
3587728	3587968	All right.
3588228	3589870	Let's bring in the ultimate two sounds.
3591411	3591771	All right.
3594542	3623224	you gotta find a song from Song Pack 9 alright alright but don't you dare play Forever Sunshine cause I hate that crap gotcha pick a skill level now you can see I don't want any ass shots here and the background live on cam www.orangeloungeradio.com alright ok that's fine go to the left it'll be faster you know alright let's see here
3625134	3631239	Alright, Regret, Ogia, there's Jelly Kiss.
3631439	3633580	No, you're going back into Song Pack 7 and stuff.
3633600	3634881	Go over to... Alright.
3635902	3636162	Okay.
3639790	3644551	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
3672253	3674894	Well, for a five-footer, I mean, there's not much to expect of this one.
3676154	3677815	That's five on heavy.
3677855	3678415	It's pretty bad.
3688759	3690140	It's kind of hard for a five-footer.
3690180	3691880	It's got, like, offbeat notes and everything.
3699266	3701087	Look at us.
3701167	3702707	It's kind of like fast stuff.
3703607	3705568	This seems kind of hard for a five to me.
3705628	3707388	It would be different like a six.
3707728	3712730	If our listeners are watching the webcam on OrangeRomeRadio.com, they can get a pretty good view of us.
3713010	3713990	Absolutely.
3714570	3717711	And just so you know, yes, my colors are all screwed up on the notes.
3718251	3720152	I'll tell you why I do that after Loki finishes.
3722533	3726214	It's my way of kind of like getting an edge up on Xbox Live when I play.
3726914	3727214	Cheater.
3727873	3731295	I'm not a cheater, I'm just exploiting something in the game.
3731315	3732875	This is not a five, I'm sorry.
3732895	3734256	That is not a five.
3758450	3759130	Seven, maybe?
3765112	3770254	But then again, I can't really judge song difficulty anymore, because, like, I'm out of shape.
3772174	3773675	This plays about like a seven.
3773755	3775875	Okay, how many calories would you say you burned on that one?
3776216	3776716	I don't know.
3777136	3777776	I could tell you.
3778476	3778676	Okay.
3778696	3779036	About 40.
3780617	3781317	Okay, let's see.
3781957	3784118	Let's see what kind of grade Loki got on that one.
3784724	3788707	Let's see, 37 greats, I'd say that's about a C. Oh, he got an A!
3788788	3789648	Because I rock.
3789868	3790369	Good job.
3790389	3792150	Okay, so what did you think of those steps?
3793071	3794172	Eh, they were okay.
3794292	3796554	They were kind of fun, except that, you know, I hate free stuff.
3798236	3800718	Alright, now you've got to do the kata, do Disable the Flaw.
3800738	3801298	Oh, God.
3801358	3802699	Here, I'll hold the mic for you.
3802719	3802880	Alright.
3803700	3804881	No, make him hold the mic while he does it.
3804981	3806262	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3806623	3807503	I don't want him to trip.
3807704	3808544	I want feedback.
3808564	3810906	We don't want him to trip up the cord and die.
3810946	3811487	He'll live.
3813717	3815297	Here, I'll hold the cord up so you don't trip.
3815718	3817918	I promise to set you on fire at your funeral.
3818098	3819379	I'm gonna hate you, man.
3820019	3821459	We will launch you out to sea when you die.
3822399	3823020	In a catapult.
3825700	3827241	What, this song's only like a minute ten.
3838544	3839184	Don't fail.
3839304	3840505	You're on the internet right now.
3840545	3841885	They'll all know if you fail this crap.
3842446	3842766	Shut up!
3850613	3852335	Cool down break.
3854557	3856258	I gotta cut up some slack on this mic cord.
3860642	3861463	Oh my god.
3863585	3864045	Oh man.
3865667	3868109	This is like classic Kata stuff.
3872253	3873133	I love this song, though.
3873153	3874613	This is like a real gem in this song.
3874774	3877454	I would say this is my favorite song in this song pack.
3877494	3881835	Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.
3882575	3887096	Hey, he's got, he's got a... Huh.
3887296	3887576	Thank God.
3888116	3889016	Good job.
3889116	3889977	I am so out of shape.
3890037	3891257	I really need to go back and play.
3891537	3892457	What'd you think of those steps?
3895118	3896578	Um, is it a worthy download?
3896598	3896978	Would you pay?
3897118	3899478	You got a D. Shut up.
3899799	3901599	D for, uh, the bum ass.
3903024	3909186	Okay, I would say, if you're out of shape like me, don't play the Cat is on Pat.
3909206	3911107	Would you spend $5 for that?
3911147	3913048	I'm going to turn down the Ultramix music there.
3914088	3914689	Yeah, I would.
3916149	3917830	Really, they're kind of stretching for songs now.
3917890	3919491	Ooh, your D is on the webcam, too.
3922772	3923092	Alright.
3924433	3925113	I'm done, man.
3925413	3926213	Alright, you're done?
3926894	3929134	You sure you don't want to do one Forever Sunshine, Jamie, for us?
3929895	3930175	I'll do it.
3931997	3933217	I'm trying to get Jamie to get up there.
3936799	3937519	No, no, I'm serious.
3937559	3938379	Don't play Forever Sunshine.
3938399	3938980	I was totally kidding.
3939020	3939480	I hate that song.
3939500	3943741	If you play Forever Sunshine, I will cut off your ankles.
3943801	3944622	I like Ogia.
3947683	3950544	I would have to say, yeah, it's worth a download.
3950564	3951824	I mean, the steps are pretty good.
3952224	3956406	They weren't retarded like, say, you know, was it...
3957748	3960933	Outer Limits or anything like that, where it's just ridiculous fast and stuff.
3961254	3966802	The Table of Flaw, they had stuff sort of like your old school Katas, where it's a long run of eighth notes and stuff like that.
3967824	3968165	Pretty good.
3968986	3969627	Alright, sounds good.
3970120	3975022	Now, for those of you guys that are wondering, why the hell does it show the red notes and blue notes and yellow notes?
3975063	3975943	Why doesn't it look right?
3976303	3983167	It's because, actually, the way my system is set up on the Xbox, I actually have it set to show the notes, the different colors on purpose.
3983587	3989610	Because the reason why I do that is so that when I go on Xbox Live, it shows up that way, and it makes it so much easier to read the notes.
3989650	3992211	Because you really can't change things when you play on Xbox Live.
3993672	3995333	What other songs came out in that song pack?
3996033	3996513	Oh, Gia.
3996553	3997154	I like that one.
3999475	3999795	Was that
4000984	4002884	This is Guitar Freaks, I think?
4004025	4005245	Yeah, this is originally from Guitar Freaks.
4006225	4011607	Okay, and then we've got Regret, which is, what was that?
4014967	4017928	I think, okay, well, Regret I think was Beatmania, wasn't it?
4017948	4018188	I think so.
4018448	4020789	And then we have Jelly Kiss from 2DX7, I believe.
4022259	4025382	And then we've got Disabled, The Flaw, which is Beatmania.
4026543	4028124	Beatmania and I think Poppin' Music.
4028485	4031747	And then Forever Sunshine, which is Max, too.
4031828	4034410	And everyone remembers that song for being so awful.
4038734	4039294	I think pretty good.
4039774	4040996	For five bucks, I mean, you can't beat it.
4041116	4041796	I mean, come on.
4042397	4043037	Just download it.
4043658	4044419	Wait for the next pack.
4044439	4046901	It's better than some of the other song packs they put out not that long ago.
4046941	4047401	Yeah, exactly.
4047922	4048162	All right.
4049072	4054376	Just as long as we don't get a whole song pack of mixes of Let Them Move, then it's not too bad.
4055817	4056098	Okay.
4056538	4057519	So, I don't know.
4057539	4058599	Are we going to do one more?
4059280	4059860	Sure, why not?
4059920	4060461	Alright, one more.
4060501	4061141	Do Oh Yeah!
4061181	4061702	I like that one.
4061722	4062002	Oh Yeah?
4062202	4062442	Okay.
4064664	4064924	Alright.
4066185	4067906	Let's bring up the Ultramix 2 music again.
4069988	4070748	I like this song.
4070788	4071209	I'm sorry.
4071549	4072690	Done by Asmat Nemi.
4072730	4072870	Ready?
4072910	4073710	Here we go!
4073770	4074371	Oh Yeah!
4077864	4081927	From what I remember about this song, it's just one constant stream of notes, really.
4083088	4090234	It's a very poppin' music.
4090935	4091275	It is.
4091815	4093217	You know what it looks like?
4093377	4099802	It looks like that they actually put in, like, new background videos, though, in some of this, which I think is kind of cool.
4101623	4104446	Or at least, like, background videos we haven't really seen before, so...
4106634	4107595	That was very wormy.
4108815	4112357	I like this song because it's different for DDR.
4112377	4115278	Like, you're like, what the heck is this?
4115358	4118080	It's like Bollywood or something.
4129873	4130414	I love those runs.
4130434	4131054	I love those cheap runs.
4131174	4133357	Oh, dude, Loki's like hecka sweating.
4133397	4134157	Look at that.
4134177	4135919	This is called out of the game.
4135939	4136540	Dance, monkey, dance.
4155197	4159980	When we bring the webcam back up, I want to zoom in on Loki's sweat to show what a workout he's getting there.
4161261	4163222	Oh man, my legs feel like weights.
4163242	4166464	I'm surprised I could play something, but I don't want to play any of those songs.
4166504	4166924	Oh man.
4167745	4169065	Those songs still seem very fun to me.
4170166	4171387	You want to do something from Song Pack 8?
4171667	4171867	No.
4175029	4176750	Alright Jamie, come on, show us how to do it.
4178351	4179071	Alrighty.
4182173	4182634	Alrighty.
4185037	4188498	Yeah, actually, the chatroom is suggesting you do a freestyle to this one.
4190258	4192419	Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle.
4192999	4194599	Chatroom, love y'all, but y'all suck.
4195039	4204941	By the way, she got a D. Or, I'm sorry, he got a D. Another D. Jamie's here to pretty up the photo op.
4211152	4213373	Not really much, though, because Loki's a damn sexy man.
4214114	4214454	I know.
4217455	4218376	I need to play some more.
4218536	4219977	Do another regular Ultimax 2 songs.
4221077	4222658	I can see a dance in your dance.
4228739	4229300	I'm fine.
4229360	4233903	Now that's... That's the picture to get.
4233943	4234924	The agony of defeat.
4236565	4239207	Play Max 300.
4241968	4242429	No.
4243770	4244410	I don't remember that.
4245811	4249133	Japanese tourists taking pictures, man.
4251935	4253577	It's because you're an American tourist attraction.
4253597	4256359	She's like, I'm in heaven or close your eyes or skulk or something.
4259042	4260422	Dude, there's a song called Gyrus.
4260642	4261843	That's totally sweet.
4261903	4264303	It's a remix of the Gyrus theme from... Dude!
4264423	4272325	It's awesome.
4272345	4273265	Jamie's apologizing.
4273305	4275386	It's taking her so long to pick a song, but she's just kind of picky.
4276426	4277286	Four weeks later.
4278406	4284367	By the way, we hardly ever actually play DDR on the show, so this is a rare opportunity for you guys.
4284507	4285108	Yeah.
4285348	4286828	As if you can't tell by the wheezing.
4287785	4288946	I play a lot of DDR.
4291087	4291447	Oh, yeah.
4291827	4292147	Oh, yeah.
4292368	4292688	Come on.
4292708	4293828	Come on.
4295069	4303353	Boo.
4303433	4309557	Hold down B. No, I lied.
4309597	4313539	Hit A. And this time hold down A. Hold down.
4313679	4314059	There you go.
4315340	4316601	And then you can go down to...
4318214	4318454	Other.
4320975	4322775	I think that's where you can turn off the freeze arrows.
4323095	4324375	Oh no, there it is, right there, freeze.
4325896	4326196	Alright.
4326916	4330977	This is going to be the last one, and Jamie's going to give you her thoughts on Chasmic Cowgirl.
4332637	4334097	She says she hasn't played DDR in a month.
4344499	4347320	She's making it look good with so many crepes on Perfects.
4350748	4351589	Go, Jamie!
4357592	4359614	I used to love this song when I was in Guitar Freaks.
4360154	4362836	Yeah, I was just thinking, man, this makes me want to play Guitar Freaks.
4364917	4366098	Do you guys have Guitar Freaks?
4366558	4368099	No, sadly not here.
4368299	4369940	Damn, I should have brought mine.
4371921	4374623	You got us shaking our butts now, Mr. DJ.
4374983	4377285	You do got us shaking our butts now, Mr. DJ.
4384625	4386685	Okay, well, she just has to go and show me up now.
4387746	4388486	That's no fair.
4392567	4394267	That's because she's more in shape than I am.
4394827	4398328	Yeah, she's been preparing for that mud run, so you know she's got the stamina for this.
4398388	4399728	I've been preparing for a Big Mac.
4404629	4410150	Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and get this, sesame seed bun, baby.
4412051	4413631	Too much burger for one man to handle.
4427219	4428199	Yay!
4428279	4428900	Alright, what'd you think?
4429260	4454860	That was so freaking easy, that wasn't an 8 Okay, so that, you know, they have an 8 Kill us, your moves And a 5 for New high score The verdict is a B She got a slightly better score than Loki, thank you That's cause he said something that made me laugh It was a new high score I broke someone's goal, whore Alright, so what'd you think of that?
4455509	4456169	Here's your chair, Beck.
4456770	4457050	Fun?
4459371	4459991	Yeah, pretty fun.
4460351	4460651	All right.
4461172	4462592	Maybe I need to start doing DDR again.
4464833	4465253	All right.
4465393	4471176	Because the ironic thing is, even though we talk about these music games a whole lot here on the station, we haven't played them in quite a while.
4471236	4473657	No.
4473817	4475978	Hey, I played Step Mania, but that's with my hand.
4476058	4479140	I played the Button Button Revolution, and that's still kind of fun.
4479160	4481321	I now know why people don't exercise in jeans.
4481621	4481941	All right.
4482361	4483902	Anyway, can we go back to regular?
4483942	4484042	Yeah.
4484102	4484362	All right.
4485307	4488402	What we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.
4489255	4505679	For those of you guys that have any feedback, you want to talk about 2DX Night Style, or you want to talk about what else is going on in the scene, we were talking a little bit about Bawani tournaments going on earlier, and if you have any feedback on Ultramix 2 and the performance of DarkSakura and Loki, we certainly would love to hear that as well.
4505739	4509780	So, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call.
4510620	4516261	Again, to do that, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.
4518208	4520449	Alright, let's go ahead, we got one coming in.
4521470	4522991	Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
4525453	4526393	Legend of Zaku here.
4526533	4527754	Hello, Zaku, how you doing?
4528154	4532337	As always, I'm... Yes, I'm... Hi, Zaku.
4533638	4538001	Just coming back from Spring Break and all, and managing to play 2DX10 style, unfortunately.
4539302	4541443	Wait, you did get to play 2DX10 style?
4541483	4542564	It was kind of like, yeah...
4544651	4550318	Yes, because, you know, Long Island, not far from the city, has a place that has 2DX10.
4550738	4556705	And I managed to travel out there by bus, like a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday.
4556845	4558307	Getting on the bus to go nerd it up, huh?
4559733	4574638	Yeah, but it was worth the trip, you know, because, you know, not only did they have that, they also had in the groove poppin' music, they had Flash Bees, which is basically Step Mania in a solo cabinet with poppin' music buttons.
4575579	4578720	Oh yeah, I've heard of that game, it was, god, I can't remember.
4579278	4579898	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4606576	4611509	I mean I saw other folks breaking out the towel and putting it on there, but... I can't play without a towel.
4613806	4619450	But anyways, you know, I'm hearing word that 2DX12 Happy Sky is going up for location testing.
4619690	4620331	Oh, yes.
4620631	4622813	That name is so... You repeat us to it.
4622853	4624634	We were going to talk about that a little bit later.
4624734	4630178	But yes, they've announced 2DX12 style, also known as Happy Sky.
4630298	4633020	Which is ironic when you consider what my online name is, Sky.
4633420	4634181	Happy Sky!
4634201	4635302	That made you Happy Sky.
4635322	4636162	I'm so happy!
4636182	4637323	I'm happy that this game's coming.
4637343	4638104	At this point, I mean...
4638897	4642640	We managed to get the upgrade in that place that managed to get 10th style.
4643281	4652208	See, it was originally 9th, but late last year they managed to go up to 10th, seeing that they got the 2DX machine earlier last year.
4652328	4664918	So, I'm assuming that, you know, according to the thread, once I mention, you know, 12, that they'll try to plan to just go after getting that upgrade kit, same way they did for 10th.
4666135	4668196	And that surprises us when we manage to get 10th, you know?
4689063	4693908	No, it really depends, because in our area, I mean, we're having tournaments.
4693928	4698313	We're about to have a big tournament, hopefully in April, next month in Albany.
4698873	4705520	We already had a slew of smaller, low-level tournaments, one of which almost ended up in fighting, as I told you last time.
4705620	4706781	Yeah, yeah, I remember that.
4706861	4707501	With the drama?
4707581	4717827	Well, there's one reason why you don't have the... No, but I mean, that was because of the locals who basically acted like assholes and, you know, basically started, you know, disrespecting other, you know, outsiders.
4718007	4719568	Outside players were beating them to it.
4719788	4722269	So what do you think is causing the decline out here, then?
4722929	4724410	It's not really that much of a decline.
4724430	4725871	It really depends on where you go.
4726311	4728073	I mean, it depends on where a scene thrives.
4728113	4735857	I can understand where Northern California, you know, I can understand your scene over there because it's striving for something new, like in the group.
4737598	4743122	I think you're on the verge, in my honest opinion, you're on the verge of just switching on to more in-the-group tournaments.
4744905	4747186	I don't know how I feel about that, though, to be honest.
4747246	4748587	I don't know how I feel about In The Groove.
4749307	4752589	You know, to be honest, though, In The Groove, I'm not sure about the freestyle part of it.
4752609	4754371	Yeah, that's the problem.
4754651	4762896	In The Groove was made for Perfect Attack tournaments, but freestyle... Yes, the East Coast already held In The Groove tournaments and ate on the break late last year.
4763796	4764837	And it was a pretty good turnout.
4765852	4766913	I don't, I mean, I don't know.
4767033	4772718	It's just, it doesn't seem like the game's really that, I mean, you're always hearing about the thing.
4772758	4773358	It may be.
4773619	4781545	I mean, I know it was built for, like, really, for, like, basically DDR on crack because of the fact that it's going to be on 10 foot and 10 feet.
4781805	4783267	Wait, I mean, you're talking, like, 10 footers, 12, 13.
4783447	4784728	It's in the groove.
4787270	4788651	Well said!
4788931	4790932	Indigroove in a nutshell is DDR on crack!
4791373	4791953	That's what it is!
4792033	4794675	Indigroove in a nutshell is DDR on crap!
4796976	4802280	But wait till Indigroove 2 comes out, and then you know, they're gonna start thinking.
4802500	4804742	You know what, I've been warming up to Indigroove.
4804822	4806343	I honestly cannot knock the game.
4806483	4806623	It's...
4807512	4808573	No, you've become desensitized.
4808593	4809673	Tournaments are pretty good.
4810414	4812515	I mean, you know, the tournament scene is still there.
4812575	4814396	It's just, you know, it needs something good.
4814476	4816257	It needs something new to go on.
4816338	4817018	Para, para.
4818559	4819760	We need more para, para.
4820240	4823822	We were so grateful of managing to pull off a Nationals tournament last year.
4824423	4826664	And that created, that got a big turnout.
4826704	4829566	Not only that, we managed to expose DDR to a lot of things.
4829586	4831447	To a lot of people that probably never heard of it.
4832079	4834504	and we're getting DDR the limelight it deserves.
4834985	4843543	I mean, you know, tournaments in fact are doing, you know, more great things for, you know, it depends on where it is though.
4844545	4845065	Thanks for watching!
4862970	4866553	They're preparing, well, from what I heard, they are preparing for this year's.
4867294	4869876	They might do another Nationals tournament this year in October.
4870657	4872198	It's all talk until something happens.
4872258	4877823	This whole exposure thing, though, I don't think it's necessarily that good of a thing.
4877963	4879184	Yeah, but think about it.
4879204	4885209	It's in New York City, and you have mods such as Frequency Busting putting foot to ass trying to help, you know, help it get out there.
4885709	4889570	You know, it's usually when something gets to be a little too popular that it starts getting...
4906014	4908356	and it's basically what you make of it.
4908816	4917881	Whether or not you want to decide to pedal in the groove and in the groove 2, which is coming out, which could be an alternative to people who've been sucking on Xtreme for what now?
4918201	4919142	Almost two and a half years?
4919282	4921143	Well, I mean, we will see.
4921203	4922904	That's really all we can say right now is we will see.
4922944	4926466	But we got to go because the Skype line is ringing.
4926506	4928347	But is there any other final thought you have for us, Zaku?
4929508	4930749	Basically, just, you know...
4932244	4937886	Just basically, you know, In The Groove 2 might, you know, just be ready in case.
4938546	4940146	Just try not, I don't know.
4940266	4943347	I will give In The Groove 2 a fair shot just like I gave In The Groove a fair shot.
4943387	4943647	I will.
4943827	4945068	Just be even with it.
4945108	4945468	Just be fair.
4945488	4946188	You promise, Jamie?
4946448	4946908	You promise?
4947048	4947868	Open mind, In The Groove?
4948349	4949329	At least be ajar.
4949969	4951789	I've still got to try it, you know.
4951889	4952530	All right, Zach.
4952550	4953330	Have a good one, buddy.
4953810	4954290	Take care.
4954330	4954870	Later.
4955450	4956471	All right, let's take another call.
4956511	4957471	Let's go to this one.
4959057	4970786	Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio Merching from the shadows of Bermondi Style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLineXVI Hello, our resident 2DX bastard, what's on your mind?
4972447	4976090	I finally got my copy of 2DX Night Style Hurrah, what do you think?
4976751	4979513	Yeah, it's really good Did you get the one with all the stickers?
4980273	4986578	Well, I don't have a sticker, I only have the regular edition I want all the DVDs and the stickers So what are your thoughts?
4986658	4987399	Tell us what you think
4988286	4989468	It's really good, actually.
4989508	4991410	It's almost like in the arcade version.
4991430	4992371	Uh-oh.
4993172	4994093	Wait, what about the timing?
4994113	4995194	We haven't talked about the timing.
4995214	4996876	Specifically, not the timing.
4997517	4998618	They think the timing's okay?
4999039	5000360	The timing is okay, actually.
5000681	5001121	I need mine.
5001822	5004626	What was the deciding factor is the timing.
5004666	5004926	Guys.
5006286	5011769	I was going to say, because, you know, with the arcade there, of course, you're upgrading the hardware and stuff, so you've got the timing issues for that.
5012349	5016891	But with the home version, it's pretty much just, you know, they reskin it, throw new songs in, you're done.
5017071	5018812	So that's pretty much, you know, all for that.
5019212	5024634	So, of course, the timing should be right on, you know, compared with some of the other ones, it should be just fine.
5024774	5028376	So, anyways, you enjoy it?
5029301	5030922	Yeah, of course I do enjoy it.
5031322	5033382	Hey Sky, remember the videos that I sent you?
5033402	5044827	Yeah, so I was going to ask you, because you sent me actually one of your, you know, videos where you actually hooked it up, so you're playing 2DX, and you can see, you actually, like, you were playing Love Shine, and you see the notes falling.
5045427	5047968	I did play Love Love Shine, it's one of my Tatsujin videos.
5047988	5055790	Right, it's a new Tatsujin video, but you set it up in your house so that we can see your fingers playing the song instead of the typical video.
5056090	5056791	How'd you set that up?
5056811	5057331	That's pretty cool.
5058362	5063166	Yeah, you know, I use a tripod, I use a camcorder, and then I use my PC as my monitor.
5064788	5065048	Huh.
5065248	5071394	Speaking of which, I'm going to send you a link of what my setting looks like.
5071474	5075899	All right, put that on our chat room, www.orangelaunchradio.com, clicking on chat.
5075979	5079382	Go ahead and slap that up in our chat room so our folks there can check it out, the link.
5079878	5081979	Yeah, this is what my setup looks like.
5082200	5087043	Okay, now do you have a site where we can actually download the Tatsujin videos for those that want to see what this looks like?
5087063	5090365	Are you going to throw them on Vimani style like everyone else that does Tatsujin videos?
5090765	5094207	Well, mine is different, so... I got it from DustBacon.
5095408	5096649	Are you really made out of iron?
5099611	5102813	Well, there's a difference between Tatsujin and Tetsujin.
5103794	5104314	Oh, sorry.
5107721	5114306	Here's the link for my Tatsujin videos, as well as a Seastar player and others.
5115687	5121892	Let me log into my photobucket so I can give you the link to what my aesthetic looks like.
5121992	5126815	While you're doing that, what would you say would be your favorite of the new consumer songs that are in 9th style?
5127296	5129598	Well, my favorite... Here's a correction.
5129718	5132080	It's not photogenic, it's photongenic.
5132500	5133080	Oh, my bad.
5134021	5134782	I read it quickly.
5136286	5137267	It's Photongenic.
5137867	5141249	Yeah, my favorite.
5141389	5142210	Is that your favorite?
5142270	5144571	Yeah, Photongenic's my favorite.
5144631	5148093	Other than that, it's also, I like Jaeger Final Attack.
5148374	5150755	Jaeger Hamster Dance, as I call it.
5152756	5155278	Is it just me, or has Denjin Jaeger gone fat?
5156678	5160740	You know, I haven't actually seen the video that goes along with the song just yet, so I couldn't really tell you that.
5160960	5162000	I do have the video.
5162020	5164161	You're going to have to send that to me at some point so I can check it out.
5164561	5167242	I'll send it to you after this call.
5167862	5168643	Okay, sounds good.
5170063	5171944	Is there anything else you wanted to say, Siggy?
5171964	5175445	Because I've got to let you go to get somebody else here on the line, but is there anything else you wanted to say?
5176986	5180147	Nothing much else, but I'm just happy that I have my night style.
5180402	5181043	All right, sounds good.
5181483	5184305	Keep us posted on any developments going on in the 2DX world.
5184345	5187587	Yeah, I already sent you the link to what my settings look like.
5187848	5188548	All right, sounds good.
5189569	5190550	We'll check that out in the chat room.
5191070	5191330	All right.
5191450	5192151	All right, have a good one, bud.
5192671	5192891	Later.
5193051	5193292	Later.
5194272	5197455	All right, let's try to pick up a call here, if I can.
5200197	5201217	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5202538	5203499	Hey, it's Jimmy.
5203899	5204660	Hey, what's up?
5204680	5205360	Not much.
5205380	5205861	Not much?
5206581	5207061	How's it going?
5207081	5208642	I gotta turn down my window real quick.
5208722	5209123	There we go.
5209223	5209903	That's alright, yes.
5210023	5212164	First rule of calling into radio, turn off your radio.
5212645	5213926	Yeah, I know how that is.
5214066	5214366	Alright.
5214666	5214926	What's up?
5214946	5215406	What's on your mind?
5217108	5225172	I'm just going off of the first caller, the ITG, the way tournaments are going here in SoCal.
5225212	5227474	It's basically all in the groove now.
5229155	5231937	So you're saying in Southern California now, it's all about in the groove?
5232317	5232537	Yeah.
5232557	5233418	Does that include freestyle?
5233438	5233558	Yeah.
5235069	5249355	The first big one was in Stonewood, and everyone was pretty much going nuts, because you can see the percentages on the screen, and you get instant feedback while the people are playing, instead of having to count the greats while people are going.
5249755	5260159	Okay, so you can kind of watch the scores go up, because In the Groove is one of those games where it's considered acceptable to use the scores as something that determines how well you do in the tournament.
5260598	5264379	Yeah, because basically everyone knows exactly how the scoring system works.
5264399	5264659	Okay.
5265219	5268060	And it's just a good scoring system, I think.
5268220	5273481	Okay, well, what I have to know, I have no doubt that In the Groove is a great game for tournaments, but I have to know, freestyle.
5274281	5275181	How does freestyle work?
5276761	5279342	I've yet to see a freestyle tournament for it.
5279562	5281982	There's only been... Yeah, there's a reason for that.
5282002	5282302	Told you.
5282422	5283023	Told you.
5283043	5284683	Yeah, the songs just aren't there.
5287451	5294196	I've freestyled, and I really don't think there's a whole lot of freestyable songs on ITG.
5294516	5296878	I really do.
5297238	5300040	With the DDR crossovers, I guess we'll call them.
5300260	5301741	That will definitely be cool.
5301761	5303222	Follow the Sun and all that stuff.
5307401	5309662	Well, anything else you wanted to share with us, my friend?
5310602	5312583	I'm hoping to get to the X-Night style soon.
5313163	5315364	Yeah, we all want it, but we're poor.
5316184	5316704	What can we say?
5317985	5320906	But yeah, free sound in the group doesn't really work.
5322606	5324447	Hopefully they will fix that within the group too.
5324507	5324907	We shall see.
5325327	5326207	That's what I'm hoping for.
5326227	5327208	Thanks a lot, guys.
5327228	5327588	Sounds good.
5327608	5328128	Have a good one, buddy.
5328608	5328888	You too.
5328988	5329188	Later.
5330509	5333049	Alright, let's take one more call.
5333750	5334670	Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.
5336249	5342230	It's the one and only token black cosplayer, Ranma.
5342250	5343391	How you guys doing tonight?
5343531	5345751	Hello, our token black cosplayer friend.
5345771	5346151	How are you?
5346171	5347731	I'm good, I'm good.
5347791	5350512	Actually, you do have competition out here in the form of J-Ryoga.
5352612	5353653	You know J-Ryoga H?
5354193	5355613	Yeah, a long time.
5356613	5357533	Yeah, he's one of my friends.
5358114	5358574	Wow.
5359174	5359614	Who knew?
5359694	5360234	There's more than one.
5360254	5360814	Small world.
5361054	5361854	There's more than one.
5362755	5363295	What's up with that?
5363575	5364515	How are you doing, my friend?
5365129	5365930	I'm doing good.
5366391	5368875	We had a cosplay photo shoot in Central Park today.
5370157	5370958	We got kicked out.
5374002	5375284	Now this I have to hear about.
5375344	5380292	So for those who don't know, because remember we have new listeners on tonight, what is cosplay, for those who don't know?
5381044	5382946	Cosplay or Costume Play.
5383006	5387590	You dress up as your favorite anime, video game, or manga characters at anime conventions.
5388590	5395716	And sometimes this can be scantily clad females from fighting games, or this can be just like downright ugly guys from who knows what.
5396637	5397518	Or, you know, whatever.
5397878	5401461	Downright ugly guys cosplaying as scantily clad female video game players.
5401541	5405424	Yes, I've seen that too.
5405665	5407246	So, okay, I have to know, how did you guys...
5408078	5410841	What were you guys setting up to do in Central Park, and how did you get kicked out?
5410901	5411641	That's what I have to know.
5412102	5412783	That's just it.
5412943	5414464	We didn't do anything.
5414704	5417607	We were just taking pictures of ourselves in costumes and stuff.
5417647	5418968	You were dressed up like freaks!
5419208	5421631	You were freaks, and the freaks have to go!
5421991	5423572	It was mostly hot EGL girls.
5424473	5430499	Now, were you guys all dressing up like ghosts in a big group and having a rally, and you know, then they might have kicked you out because of that?
5431179	5432160	No, we were more...
5433430	5434670	More like, you know, less than that.
5434690	5442732	Of course, you know, whenever cosplay events in the park happen, like, say, in Tokyo, then a bajillion people take pictures of it and it ends up in Fruits Magazine, right?
5443512	5447513	Right, but there was only like five people from outside that were walking around and took pictures of us.
5448814	5453135	What I'm curious about, was it the scantily clad females that got you kicked out of Central Park?
5453835	5454075	Nope.
5454195	5458216	It seems that you need a permit to take pictures in Central Park.
5459301	5459541	What?
5459681	5462862	Everybody and their mother was going to Central Park to take pictures of the gates.
5462922	5464423	Did they get a permit for that?
5465023	5465583	That's just it.
5465603	5466524	That's what we argued.
5466764	5471205	They said because it's for commercial purposes, we need a permit.
5471245	5474746	And on the weekends, we need special permission from the mayor.
5475807	5476667	Oh my gosh.
5477227	5479028	Is this for commercial purposes?
5479568	5481409	No, this is for amateur stuff for our websites.
5482309	5482929	Oh my gosh.
5483269	5485150	I say next time you're there, burn down the gates.
5486912	5487813	Gator already gone.
5488293	5488633	Damn.
5488673	5489454	See?
5489574	5490355	Mission accomplished!
5492096	5494018	They've been replaced by Altercade machines.
5494738	5496840	You know, that's just so ridiculous.
5496860	5501123	I mean, I used to do LARP vampire games in Alabama.
5501143	5503765	And we were just all kinds of insane.
5503945	5508188	Alabama parking lot or whatever you did is slightly different than Central Park.
5508228	5511891	No, we would do it in downtown Mobile at Bienville Square.
5512051	5512732	Okay, okay.
5513528	5514048	My bad.
5514589	5515709	Which is a historical landmark.
5515749	5517690	They should have told them it was for a school project.
5517710	5519031	It's a historical landmark.
5519531	5520011	We did.
5520192	5521592	And we never got anything for it.
5521632	5524954	Yeah, that's the easy excuse whenever you need to get out of something.
5525514	5526895	It's for a school project.
5526935	5528736	We didn't know we were doing it.
5529156	5529916	Not this time.
5531897	5532278	All right.
5533098	5535719	Anything going on in your gaming world you want to share with us, buddy?
5536880	5539141	I was at the PSP release at my job.
5539601	5541182	We sold 260 of them.
5541202	5542843	20 came back.
5544608	5545848	and 15 came back the next day.
5546508	5549569	Is that the dead pixel thing that's going on with the new PSPs I'm hearing about?
5549589	5550969	They're too anal.
5551449	5553290	So, are they really that bad?
5553330	5553890	Have you seen them?
5554510	5554890	No.
5556730	5557951	Some are, some aren't.
5558011	5560391	Since we're Geek Squad, we have to take a look at these things.
5560791	5563392	We got Dan, who's actually a manager of a GameStop in town.
5563412	5565612	It's very, very minor and these people are too anal.
5565652	5566712	Hey, I got... You know what?
5566772	5569073	Can you send me some of those defective PSPs?
5569093	5570073	Because I'll take them off your hands.
5571073	5572234	Oh, don't you think I tried?
5573995	5575195	Yeah, quote unquote defective.
5575235	5577117	Okay, Dan, I know you're dying to say something.
5578477	5585742	The people who are bitching about one or two dead pixels on their PSPs are anal retentive bastards who should be shot on sight.
5587242	5587803	No shit.
5588683	5589124	Thank you.
5589924	5590524	You're welcome.
5590804	5596328	The official line now is, we don't take them back, they gotta go to Sony if they have dead pixels.
5596368	5597688	And Sony doesn't care.
5597789	5599109	No, Sony does care.
5599209	5600170	Sony is replacing them.
5600754	5601294	Are they really?
5601354	5603015	Which is very, very decent of Sony.
5603876	5608758	Basically, what you're going to get back is another dead pixel PSP that they fixed.
5609939	5610779	So, you know.
5611620	5615942	But as for anyone who has problems with dead pixels on their PSP, stick with it.
5616022	5618143	They'll either go away or you'll adjust.
5618983	5622265	You know, out of the gajillions of pixels, if one or two are dead, hey, consider yourself lucky.
5622305	5623526	Some people have a couple dozen.
5624306	5625086	They should be mad.
5625767	5625967	Yeah.
5626941	5634784	30 people Well, you know, considering how much they charge for those things, though, you'd think the thing would run absolutely perfectly.
5635144	5636024	That's the only issue.
5636044	5637265	You ever bought a tire for your car?
5638045	5638445	Yeah.
5638525	5639125	Did it go flat?
5640706	5641886	Yeah, but they replaced it for free.
5642346	5643947	LCD screens have dead pixels.
5644147	5645467	Sony will replace it for free.
5646608	5647188	I mean, that's it.
5647308	5648288	It just happens.
5650069	5650969	So you have it lucky.
5651009	5652190	We have to take them back.
5652250	5652830	We have to.
5653890	5654411	Where do you work?
5655151	5655551	Best Buy.
5658305	5660647	Oh, is that because you sell that extra insurance or whatever?
5661407	5663729	Even without the extra insurance, they bring it back.
5664389	5668212	We have to take it back, we stamp it out, de-vote, we send it back to the manufacturer.
5668272	5671674	But the thing is, Sony doesn't reimburse the manufacturer for that return.
5672354	5674676	You need to take out your frustration on the whole machine.
5676096	5679799	We get most of it back, like 85% of the value we get back, more or less.
5679959	5683701	They won't do it with the dead pixels because they don't consider those to be a defect.
5684822	5685042	Hmm.
5686120	5687441	Best Buy's policy will change.
5687481	5689202	Right now, I think they're doing the right thing.
5689642	5696245	I think, hey, if we had 100 extra systems in stock, and I had 10 people wanting to bring them back and exchange them, hey, no problem.
5696725	5706410	But, according to Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, their whole take on it is, this is how PSPs are, there's a problem with the pixels, you send them to us, we'll take care of it.
5706857	5707979	Don't bother the retailer.
5708179	5711583	And most of the smaller retailers have said, hey, we can't take them back for that reason.
5711603	5714046	Isn't this supposed to be virtually invisible anyway when you're playing?
5714807	5718352	In game, you don't see it unless it's a solid color screen.
5718933	5722337	Yeah, or from what I was told, when you turn it off, you see the dead pixels.
5722538	5724260	Well, yeah, and that's the thing is these people, they're not...
5724619	5728561	They're not, you know, trying it for a couple hours and saying, wow, this doesn't interrupt my gameplay.
5728941	5733983	They turn it on on the boot up screen, see a pixel that's green when it should be white, and lose their minds.
5734003	5735863	Well, it makes sense after they just spent $250 on it.
5736624	5742446	If they'd run the Spider-Man DVD through it, 90% of the time the pixels unfreeze since they're just frozen, not dead.
5743366	5744367	Oh, weird.
5744647	5745627	Oh, that's weird.
5746107	5750349	And the thing is, two months down the road, you might have a whole different set of dead pixels.
5751636	5753897	Because it's not like you're going to get one that's going to work forever.
5754217	5755278	LCD screens do that.
5755778	5757619	Anyone who has an LCD monitor can tell you that.
5757659	5761361	I've heard the dead pixel thing going on with the DS as well, so it's not just, you know, PSP.
5761561	5763222	It's nature of technology.
5763602	5764822	Anyway, we've got to let you go, bud.
5765062	5765943	We've got to let you go, bud.
5766163	5766843	But have a good one.
5766883	5768184	Thanks for calling us.
5768344	5768904	All right, later.
5769565	5773206	I've got to take one more because this guy's been calling us pretty constantly.
5773747	5776128	So I just want to do one more and then we're going to get into the cage.
5776148	5776688	You're so kind.
5776708	5777388	I know, I'm so kind.
5777408	5778549	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
5781189	5781509	Hello.
5784431	5785111	Can you hear us?
5785212	5785912	Oh, hey.
5786292	5787033	Hi, there you are.
5787373	5787713	What's up?
5790435	5791636	So, what's up?
5791716	5792336	Hi, who's this?
5794337	5795278	I think that might be really bad.
5795338	5796339	This is my mom.
5797519	5798040	We can hear you.
5798080	5798880	Can you hear us, buddy?
5801762	5802462	Can you hear me now?
5802502	5803243	I don't think he can hear us.
5804003	5804724	Sorry, bud.
5804764	5805264	We can't hear you.
5806125	5806905	Oh, he hung up on us.
5807606	5808706	Alright, we tried.
5808746	5809227	We tried.
5809387	5809687	We tried.
5811139	5816464	For those of you guys that are still trying to get in, thanks, but we are going to just come back to this later.
5816564	5819587	We'll do the match game, don't forget, we've got that coming up a little later on.
5819887	5823090	But for now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
5823931	5830658	So, for those of you guys unfamiliar with the Cage Match, the way it works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.
5831705	5835108	And we're going to play three songs, and you guys have to be in the chat room to vote.
5835588	5838230	www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
5838731	5847998	And we will play these songs, and then you're going to pick your favorite, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.
5848018	5850620	And the winner gets a break from having to pick a song mixed with each other.
5850700	5851160	That's right.
5851221	5857906	So, Jamie, it's your break because you won last week, and it's Yoko Kanno, and the song is Rise.
5858006	5861670	Now, remember, there's no rhyme or reason for why we picked these songs.
5861770	5865933	It's three songs we like, you pick your favorite, and it goes in rotation.
5866534	5866694	Yep.
5867014	5868255	Alright, so here it is.
5868455	5870777	You only get a clip of this song, though, because it did win last week.
5870818	5871378	Here's a clip.
5871698	5874080	Song number one, Yoko Kanno, Rise.
5874261	5874561	Enjoy.
6000273	6002094	Alright, that was a clip of song number one.
6002134	6003994	That was Yoko Kanno with Rise.
6004074	6006715	And now you get to hear two new songs in their entirety.
6007096	6009576	I'm going to start it off with my pick for tonight's Cage Match.
6009636	6014238	Now, you might remember, or you may not if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
6014278	6015018	If so, welcome.
6015479	6018220	But we've retired a couple songs from the Cage Match.
6018240	6020741	When a song wins four times, we retire it.
6021141	6024702	And the first song that ever got retired was a Top 40 hit.
6024822	6026163	It was Gwen Stefani, remember that?
6026783	6026963	So...
6027825	6030828	I'm going to try... I'm going to try... Hey, hey, you watch it.
6030928	6031989	I like my Gwen, okay?
6032169	6036352	So I'm going to try my Top 40 luck again because I love this chick.
6036432	6036813	I'm sorry.
6036893	6037933	Don't roll your eyes at me.
6039335	6041877	Hey, the listeners don't see that.
6043878	6045260	They do when I get upset.
6045920	6046220	All right.
6046821	6048542	So anyway, I'm going to try my Top 40 luck.
6048562	6050404	What, what, what, what?
6050444	6050624	Hi.
6050704	6051945	Hi.
6052085	6054867	So we're going to do a dance remix, though, of a Top 40 hit.
6055528	6056409	So this is...
6057518	6059659	One of those stupid Hataway songs again.
6059899	6060580	It's not Hataway.
6060620	6062540	This is actually Kelly Clarkson.
6064802	6066082	Get the zero automatically.
6066182	6066743	No, no, no.
6066803	6067643	You listen to it first.
6067723	6068723	Oh, so it's a bathroom break.
6068783	6070404	This is Kelly Clarkson.
6070484	6071125	You haters.
6072105	6077428	The song is Since You Been Gone, and it's the Jason Nevins Rock the Club mix.
6077488	6077968	Enjoy, guys.
6089810	6092151	And all you'd ever need
6137592	6163662	Thanks to you, now I get what I want Since you've been gone How can I put it, you put me on I even fell for that stupid love song Yeah, yeah, since you've been gone How come I never hear
6166528	6182077	I just wanna be with you Guess you never felt that way But since you've been gone I can't breathe for the first time I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah Thanks to you, now I get
6200675	6206281	I just can't say again Again and again and again and again Did you think I would?
6241298	6243381	Thank you for watching!
6272626	6273487	DarkSakura.com
6300976	6303458	I've rocked something and now I have to go to the bathroom.
6304459	6306440	It gets a three.
6306840	6308041	No more talking for you.
6309482	6310263	Shut up, man.
6310323	6311604	Dan the Man, since you have a mic.
6311624	6313065	Get in the kitchen and make me a pie.
6314145	6316387	Dan the Man, since you have a mic, what do you think of Since You've Been Gone?
6316567	6317167	Unimpressive.
6317968	6318769	On a scale of one to ten?
6319769	6320330	Negative four.
6320790	6321531	All right, Loki.
6322892	6325453	There is no amount of alcohol in this world that would make that song good.
6326434	6327295	That was awful.
6327795	6330577	I mean, you could remix that song to hell and it would still suck.
6330987	6331847	So, guess what?
6332127	6333067	It gets a 1.
6333928	6334968	Because it's Killing Clarkson.
6334988	6335948	What were you thinking?
6336408	6337228	No, bad.
6337668	6338428	And you flipped me off.
6338448	6338769	Bad Rob.
6339409	6343750	This coming from the guy who brings his girlfriend over every Tuesday to watch American Idol.
6345770	6348390	Doesn't mean I'm going to buy any of their albums, okay?
6348490	6350011	Hey, they gave us clay.
6350131	6352271	I like reality TV sometimes.
6352391	6355912	Just because I watch reality TV does not mean that I'm going to buy the music.
6356570	6358131	Clay Aiken is funny looking.
6358171	6360011	Kelly Clarkson is a hot mama.
6360292	6362212	Clay Aiken is funny looking.
6362933	6363233	Anyway.
6364954	6365294	Alright.
6367335	6374177	I think you people who, especially considering some of the DDR songs you guys like, need to respect Kelly a little more.
6374237	6374918	I give it like a 9.
6375298	6375938	It's cool.
6375958	6376678	I like that remix.
6377939	6378379	Alright, Angel.
6380180	6381180	I like girly stuff.
6381520	6381941	Sometimes.
6382381	6384001	And she's okay.
6384162	6384422	So, 5.
6387031	6388852	God, I can't even get a pity vote from Angel.
6388932	6389313	All right.
6392435	6395397	Let's see how Loki's song spares tonight's cage match.
6395437	6396678	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
6396738	6397218	Last song.
6398359	6402682	I picked the song from everyone's favorite Kill Bill soundtrack artist.
6404717	6406438	I know I'm going to butcher this name.
6406458	6407699	You picked something at random.
6407759	6409460	I picked something, yeah.
6409580	6416764	You know, I had three of those bottle caps from Pepsi sitting here at my desk, and I was like, God damn it, I've got to go on iTunes now and get something.
6417284	6425689	So today I found this guy, and of course you'll recognize him from his ever-famous song, A Battle Without Honor or Humanity.
6426129	6429991	This is Frozen Memories by, I only remember the guy's name.
6432782	6435227	Try Tomoyasu Hote.
6435287	6435948	How does that sound right?
6436389	6436930	That'd be it.
6437211	6437752	Alright, here it is.
6438734	6441860	Song number three, Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.
6441920	6442181	Enjoy.
6673591	6675411	It was not too bad, but kind of generic.
6701130	6703032	It gets a solid 7.
6705233	6705574	Alright.
6706895	6707835	Angel, what did you think of that?
6708876	6709377	I liked it.
6709717	6709377	8.
6711458	6714881	I thought it was good, but not as good as Kelly Clarkson.
6715141	6714881	7.5.
6715862	6719625	Loki, what did you think of Tomiyasu Hotei?
6721286	6721786	I liked it.
6722387	6726870	It was interesting because I was very tempted to put in Battle Without Honor and Humanity for another...
6728416	6729417	I like the wailing guitar sound.
6729497	6730558	It was totally sweet.
6730598	6731959	That song would rock in Guitar Freaks.
6731979	6732940	I think it definitely gets at least an 8.
6752386	6754527	Maybe 8.725.
6755667	6756127	Alright.
6756147	6756687	Totally hard.
6756867	6757227	Sounds good.
6757267	6758668	Okay guys, it's time to vote.
6758748	6760628	Remember, you have to be in our chatroom to vote.
6761048	6766050	Everything we have said to this point doesn't matter because it's you guys that make the ultimate decision.
6766070	6767090	So here it is, one more time.
6767490	6769771	Song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
6778630	6782911	And song number two you can vote for tonight, Kelly Clarkson, Since You've Been Gone, Jason Nevins edit.
6791553	6796774	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.
6804856	6807017	Place vote now!
6807796	6811018	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6811579	6814020	And the one that gets the most votes will walk away the winner.
6814481	6814981	Yes, Loki.
6815381	6822246	And in case the viewing public was unsure of who the mystery person was, well, I don't know.
6822526	6823587	Rob, do you want to explain?
6824007	6824768	Oh, did he go?
6824788	6825328	Yeah, he's gone.
6825368	6826749	We gave him our contact information.
6827150	6827610	Okay, cool.
6828658	6830399	Yeah, just so you guys know.
6830419	6832000	Screw you guys, I'm going home.
6832020	6840544	If the show sounded a little weird just then, and you noticed we were doing some different stuff, there was a photographer from a local paper that was here taking pictures for like the past hour.
6840584	6841244	He was here a long time.
6841324	6842185	Yeah, he was on the webcam.
6842485	6844726	Oh, so yeah, maybe he's on the webcam.
6845246	6846407	So that's what was going on.
6846957	6848198	We're famous!
6848238	6849339	We're going to be famous!
6849399	6850280	We're going to be in the paper!
6850600	6852301	Alright, we'll see what happens with that.
6852622	6855344	I really hope they got a shot of Jamie while she was in mid-air.
6856284	6870776	Yeah, I saw the camera right here, like a couple close-up shots of me going... You know what's funny is that when he first showed up, he thought our whole show was us dancing while talking.
6872197	6874559	I was like, you want us to dance?
6875327	6876548	Okay, Dance Monkey Dance.
6877889	6879030	We're like, free publicity?
6879050	6879831	Sure, we'll get out the pad.
6879851	6881112	Let's dance.
6881392	6882173	What else do you want me to do?
6882433	6883013	Eh, it's cool.
6883133	6883654	It works out.
6883814	6884174	It's fun.
6884875	6887557	Alright, anyway, finish your votes there.
6887997	6889318	Send them over a private message to Sky.
6889739	6893842	Loki, as long as you got the microphone there, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.
6894122	6896124	Um, not too much as it was last week.
6896384	6899106	I'm still waiting for some actual sim files to come out.
6899266	6904851	I think, if I remember correctly, there was that Setmania pack that's coming out with a bunch of songs called, uh,
6905527	6935247	DDR, uh, it's like XXMix or something like that, oh, there's some link on, um, there's some link on the actual, um, Bomani style site that, um, they have there, and they were saying there was going to be an April 1st release for that, so, look for that, there's a whole thread to it, and, um, so that'd be pretty interesting, other than that, um, oh, um, pretty soon, DDR UK's relaunching pretty soon, should be this week, actually, I think Monday or Tuesday, I can't remember,
6935663	6940127	So they're coming back, and DDR Mania X is saying that they're coming back at some point.
6940407	6942830	But actually, DDR UK, they are saying they're coming back.
6942850	6943851	I think it's Monday, Tuesday.
6943871	6945652	I can't remember what exactly the day is on that.
6946453	6949576	But they're coming back, so look for good stuff from them.
6950697	6960046	I don't really know what the situation is with SimFiles, what they're going to be doing, because I think the reason they got taken down the first time was because they had licensed music on there and that kind of stuff.
6961050	6962451	So look forward to that.
6962631	6963752	That should be pretty exciting.
6963792	6965993	I'm just glad that I'll have more websites to read again.
6966673	6971156	And really, other than that, not too much else going on.
6971316	6973637	There's some sim files out there that are pretty interesting.
6974458	6976519	More crappy remixes, of course, out there.
6977320	6980281	But they give me some ideas for stuff, so I may look to doing that.
6980481	6984524	I've been kind of hitting a musician's block lately, so I haven't been making anything.
6985504	6987345	But yeah, lots of fun stuff out there.
6988206	6990167	Go download some music, songs.
6990928	6993830	And that's it.
6995791	6996111	Alright.
6997251	6998252	Okay.
6998272	7000813	We're going to take the last call for cage match votes now.
7001934	7003755	So hopefully you guys are getting those votes in.
7003995	7008977	And what we're going to do, we're going to take a break and we're going to come back and play Match Game.
7009578	7011399	And Match Game tonight has prizes.
7011479	7014060	Now, we are going to open up the Skype line.
7014340	7019443	However, we need one contestant on the Skype line and one contestant actually in the chat room.
7019523	7019723	So...
7020956	7023017	Everybody send a message to Sky.
7023058	7028521	If you want to participate in tonight's match game and you're in the chat room, send a message to Sky that says match game.
7028801	7032404	And we will pick one person at random to play the match game tonight.
7032444	7036346	Jamie will pick a number and we will have our contestant from the chat room.
7037692	7040314	3 minutes during the break here It's between 1 and 666
7062623	7069008	In this break, let's do some DDR songs, because we haven't done some DDR.
7069028	7070709	So let's just do a mix here.
7072490	7074652	Let's do Volume 4.
7074772	7077033	We're going to start off with some Volume 4.
7078975	7081697	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
7224578	7225324	Thanks for watching!

7537806	7543429	And then Thursday nights, we will be back this week with Outside the Box, 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, all your favorite gaming news.
7543749	7546671	Don't forget, we also have a podcast completely separate.
7546711	7547551	It's not this show.
7547631	7553134	It's a completely separate show we do about 25, 30 minutes in length that just talks about video games.
7553514	7555835	Check that out over on our website, orangelaundry.com.
7555855	7557036	Check out the to-go edition.
7557560	7560941	Alright, first off, let's see who won tonight's cage match.
7561821	7565982	Somewhat of a closer cage match, certainly closer cage match tonight than it was last week.
7567162	7579124	But in the end, there was one winner, and the winner of tonight's cage match is... Yoko Kanno, once again, with Rise.
7579184	7580784	Another week off.
7581044	7581804	Another week.
7582705	7583665	I love you, chat room.

7584105	7584485	Alright.
7585533	7587796	Um, we're going to be doing the match game here.
7587936	7594923	Two contestants battling to the death, or something like that, for these CDs we have.
7595003	7598487	So, we need one person from the chat room and one person on the Skype line.
7598527	7601190	So you can start hammering the Skype line now.
7601670	7604211	We're going to pick one call at random on the Skype line.
7604311	7608873	Don't go away because we will be picking up just a random call.
7609033	7612494	So let it ring and tell you here that we picked up someone else's call.
7612514	7613054	Then stop calling.
7613574	7616275	In the meantime, we've got to find out who's playing from the chat room.
7617015	7619036	DarkSakura, who is playing from chat?
7620056	7621797	You've got to pick a number between 1 and 10.
7623238	7624658	I want to pick a number between 1 and 500.
7626879	7629960	As long as that number happens to also be between 1 and 10, that's fine.
7633851	7634411	All right, fine.
7634451	7635352	Pick a number between 1 and 500.
7635472	7636472	Yeah, 1 and 500.
7636692	7638593	Whoever gets closest wins.
7638853	7639053	No, no.
7639293	7641754	Just pick a number between 1 and 10 so I can count which person's getting it.
7641774	7641754	7.
7645556	7646016	You can tell.
7646116	7646456	It's fine.
7646776	7647016	Okay.
7647376	7650578	Jamie says this person gets it.
7651218	7656840	So we have in our chat room tonight... Oh, this should be fun.
7657240	7660982	Legend of Zaku is our chat person that's going to be participating tonight.
7661002	7661062	Ooh.
7664921	7669645	Alright, so now let's go over to the Skype line and pick up a random call.
7669685	7670846	We've got all these people calling in.
7670866	7672007	Let's pick up this one.
7672728	7673809	Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
7674890	7675110	Me?
7675430	7675550	Oh.
7675990	7676231	Yes.
7677272	7677812	Who is this?
7678593	7679734	This is LemonLimeJump.
7679874	7681335	Hello, LemonLimeJump.
7681695	7682196	Hi.
7683377	7683677	Hi.
7684097	7686459	You are our other contestant for the match game tonight.
7686499	7687220	Aren't you excited?
7687901	7689442	Yeah, especially since I'm a noob.
7690331	7691252	Hello, Noob.
7691272	7692694	Hi, Noob.
7692734	7693815	First call to the station.
7693835	7694356	Congrats.
7694436	7694776	Yes.
7695317	7695698	All right.
7696158	7697940	Okay, so you're going to be playing match game tonight.
7697981	7699743	Now, do you know how match game works?
7700894	7703576	Yeah, you have to finish a sentence with a word or a phrase.
7703616	7704997	You're already a pro at this.
7705017	7706918	You're not much of a noob, because you already know what's going on.
7706978	7716225	Yes, we're going to read a sentence, and it's going to have a blank in it, and it's your job to best answer what you think the rest of us are going to put in that blank.
7716305	7721468	So, without further ado, let's get some music here for Match Game.
7721488	7724110	We definitely need some background music if we're going to be playing Match Game.
7725751	7729254	Unfortunately, we don't have the rights to use the actual Match Game theme.
7730151	7732992	DarkSakura is one celebrity you're going to try to match tonight.
7759631	7761972	Dan the Man is another celebrity you're going to try to match tonight.
7762012	7765815	DDR Angel, Loki, and myself.
7765935	7766595	Five people.
7767916	7768236	All right.
7769277	7770217	Okay, now let me let him jump.
7770277	7772419	I'm going to read the question, and you just think about it.
7772459	7776261	You think about it for a minute, and then we'll let you know when we're ready for your answer.
7776421	7776721	All right?
7777562	7777722	Okay.
7777822	7778462	All right, here we go.
7778562	7779883	Question number one.
7781787	7783668	Rob was very sad.
7783828	7784568	That's me, I'm Rob.
7785028	7793271	Rob was very sad that he was unable to attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.
7794051	7798753	However, he had more important things to do, such as stay home and blank.
7802294	7805996	Rob was very sad he couldn't attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.
7806056	7809337	However, he had more important things to do, such as stay home and blank.
7813843	7815643	Everybody in the room is thinking about that one.
7823885	7825926	Celebrities, please ding when you have an answer.
7829127	7829487	Ding.
7829847	7830607	Loki, you dinged?
7831827	7832688	Yes.
7834748	7836629	Daddy says he loves me with his belt.
7843843	7844163	All right.
7854045	7859506	I'm just waiting on our chatroom contestant, but that was my fault because I was a little late in pasting the question to him because it might be a little far behind there.
7861867	7862547	I heard a ding.
7863387	7863827	All right.
7865688	7867228	I think everybody's in.
7867268	7868048	All right, here we go.
7869148	7871589	LemonLimeJump, you start us off, my friend.
7873354	7878659	Rob was very sad that he was unable to attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.
7878719	7886507	However, he had more important things to do, such as stay at home and... Pick that Kelly Clarkson song for the cage match.
7886808	7890251	Pick the Kelly Clarkson song for tonight's cage match.
7890451	7893074	That was actually something I did do yesterday, so that's something...
7893712	7895292	Let's see what Legend of Zaku says.
7895673	7904215	Legend of Zaku said he had to stay home and play 9th style while on Vicodin and forcing a ferret to play Lion Ski 7 key.
7905936	7907676	Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.
7908816	7909957	Let's see if it's a match.
7910817	7911557	DarkSakura.
7912337	7916559	Rob had to stay home and... Build a cake for DarkSakura, Pedro style.
7916979	7919019	Build a cake for DarkSakura.
7919519	7921240	I'm sorry, that's not a match, either one.
7921300	7921640	Dan...
7922253	7927334	Rob had to stay home and... Download Prawn.
7927455	7929235	Download Prawn!
7930215	7930876	Excellent answer.
7930896	7931836	What was the other answer?
7931856	7932696	The other one.
7933336	7937357	Play Nine Style, and then LemonLimeJump said that he had to pick the Kelly Clarkson song.
7937477	7938598	Okay.
7938618	7940698	Sorry, I had a mental lapse there for a second.
7940858	7941619	Yeah, sorry, Loki.
7941759	7942559	Sorry that happened to you.
7943119	7947240	Loki, Rob had to stay home and... Watch America's Next Top Model.
7947280	7949481	Yes, watch America's Next Top Model!
7950310	7951090	Not a match, though.
7951730	7956252	That was Team Loki and Loki's fiance, Nelly.
7956432	7956832	Oh, okay.
7956892	7957572	Had to get that out there.
7957852	7958612	All right, Angel.
7959412	7962653	Rob had to stay at home and... Watch reruns of Robot Chicken.
7963254	7965394	Watch reruns of Robot Chicken.
7965534	7965994	Not a match.
7966614	7970375	My answer, Rob had to stay home and look sexy.
7971436	7972876	Because, you know, that's what I do.
7975337	7975857	Shut up!
7976877	7977197	All right.
7977317	7979518	Yeah, I had to practice my model walk.
7981147	7982968	Anyway, let's get to question number two.
7983649	7985690	So, LemonLimeJump, you didn't get it on that one.
7986010	7986511	I'm sorry.
7987211	7988192	But you have a chance.
7988212	7989473	Are you going to redeem yourself on this one?
7990773	7991394	Yeah, I hope so.
7991454	7994036	Alright, Zaku sucked on that last one too, so don't worry about it.
7994116	7995837	Alright, here we go.
7996157	7997578	At least hers made sense.
7998178	7999979	Here is question number two.
8002921	8005223	Jamie is very excited...
8006005	8007046	Also known as DarkSakura.
8007086	8014314	Jamie is very excited to be attending the upcoming Best of Live 365 ceremony in San Francisco.
8015495	8021061	However, she will not be attending if they do not have any blank at the ceremony.
8023964	8024345	Alright.
8025697	8030139	DarkSakura is very excited to be attending the upcoming Best of Live 365 ceremony.
8030159	8034581	However, she won't be attending if they don't have any blank at the ceremony.
8035101	8036101	Think about that one for a minute.
8036161	8039263	Guests, or sorry, celebrities, please let me know when you have dinged.
8042984	8043344	Ding.
8048786	8049207	Alright.
8050107	8050787	Angel's thinking.
8050847	8052168	I see her with a pen to the paper.
8052588	8053448	Don't lose hope, Angel.
8053468	8054829	Just write the first thing that comes to mind.
8055453	8061216	She won't be attending if they don't have any... And you know that there's other live 365 broadcasters out there that are listening right now.
8061717	8064538	So, this might be important for them to know.
8064638	8067160	That Jamie is not coming unless Blank is there.
8068200	8068700	So we'll see.
8069801	8070621	Alright, Angel, you got it?
8071262	8071882	I see her writing.
8071902	8072242	Good enough.
8072302	8072643	Okay!
8073283	8074784	LemonLimeJump, you're up first.
8075384	8078826	She will not be attending if they do not have any... Cheese.
8079306	8080887	Any cheese!
8082028	8082668	Alright, let's see.
8082688	8082768	Zaku!
8085416	8087317	says, Jamie is very excited to be attending.
8087377	8094061	However, she will not be attending the Best of Life 365 ceremony if they do not have any Jesus juice at the ceremony.
8094721	8095622	Jesus juice.
8096502	8097083	Not a match.
8097363	8097823	Sorry.
8098523	8100685	You know, Michael Jackson, the wine and the Diet Coke.
8100725	8100965	Get it?
8101225	8101525	All right.
8102085	8102566	Let's see.
8104467	8106608	It could be a match with one of our celebrities, though.
8106628	8107208	Let's find out.
8107288	8107969	DarkSakura.
8109710	8112251	She will not be attending if they do not have any booze.
8112551	8112712	Booze!
8112912	8113252	Booze!
8114406	8114866	Not a match.
8115207	8117548	Unfortunately, that's not a good enough match with Jesus Juice.
8117608	8118628	I can't allow that one.
8119129	8119549	DanTheMan.
8119569	8120550	Do we have a mic for DanTheMan?
8121130	8121610	DanTheMan.
8122711	8125372	Will not be attending if they do not have any... Pie.
8125492	8126253	Pie!
8126473	8127554	Excellent answer.
8127654	8128054	Not a match.
8128134	8128394	Sorry.
8128714	8129094	Loki.
8130015	8133477	She will not be attending if they do not have any... Pie.
8133677	8134398	Pie!
8134818	8135738	Another one for Pie.
8135758	8136579	I would have been a good one to pick.
8136739	8137039	Angel.
8137339	8139901	She will not be attending if they do not have any... Guinness.
8140701	8141161	Guinness!
8142623	8146445	and I said she will not be attending if they do not have any Guinness.
8146645	8149747	I also put Guinness, so... That was actually the first thing I put.
8149927	8153789	Guinness and pie were the two, but unfortunately not a match.
8153929	8155270	Sorry, LemonLimeJump.
8155570	8156150	I'm sorry.
8156351	8157131	Sorry, Zaku.
8157811	8160233	You have one more chance, though, LemonLimeJump.
8160533	8161053	One more chance.
8161073	8161373	You ready?
8162074	8162254	Yes.
8162494	8163114	Alright, here it is.
8163594	8164455	The last question.
8164495	8165255	Question number three.
8168237	8168857	Question number three.
8169197	8171799	As you heard earlier this evening...
8173007	8177069	Loki is building a charger for the DS out of Legos.
8177870	8179871	He borrowed this idea from another website.
8180691	8187935	However, soon, Loki will be writing another Lego building FAQ for OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
8188636	8193058	It's called, How to Build a Blank for Your PSP.
8195960	8196680	Out of Legos.
8197200	8198781	He'll be doing another Lego FAQ.
8199401	8201963	How to Build a Blank for Your PSP.
8203356	8204297	Think about that one for a minute.
8204357	8205759	Celebrities, let me know when you've dinged.
8205779	8208322	A ding, I guess.
8218774	8219715	I'm hearing some dings.
8221710	8223571	You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
8223591	8224832	We're in the middle of match game.
8225152	8228253	Lemon Lime Jump versus Legend of Zaku on the line.
8228854	8232796	Two sampler CDs, one for Resident Evil 4 and NBA 2005.
8232876	8233896	It's all tied up.
8233936	8234857	It's nothing right now.
8235397	8235977	We will see.
8237518	8237838	Alright.
8240099	8241080	Okay, is everybody dinged?
8241120	8242080	Are you dinged?
8242320	8242981	Okay, Angel's still there.
8243001	8245122	Oh, you want to see some chat room suggestions here, Angel?
8246162	8246402	Okay.
8250404	8251065	Of course, you guys...
8254619	8255360	Battery Charger
8280253	8282454	Battery Charger for your PSP.
8282494	8283914	A nice, logical answer.
8283954	8284974	Let's see if it pays off.
8285415	8291456	Zaku says, how to build a ghetto-rigged iPod 40 gigabytes.
8292737	8293237	Let's see.
8293657	8295338	For your PSP, we will find out.
8295998	8298419	DarkSakura, how to build a... Catapult.
8298639	8299539	Catapult!
8300219	8301260	Is not a match, I'm sorry.
8301840	8305521	DanTheMan, Loki will be showing how to build a...
8306476	8307817	Stand of displayness.
8308117	8311498	Stand of displayness out of LEGOs for the PSP.
8311959	8312799	Not a match, unfortunately.
8313079	8313479	Loki.
8314600	8320002	I guess I'll be designing a Portal to Hell device.
8320102	8320483	I don't know.
8320583	8322183	A Portal to Hell for your PSP.
8322203	8323764	A device to talk to the dead.
8324004	8324484	Out of LEGOs.
8324584	8325465	I like Portal to Hell.
8325785	8326425	Still not a match.
8326906	8327266	Angel.
8328026	8331968	He'll show you how to build a... Ghetto game dispenser.
8332328	8332888	Don't ask.
8333008	8334069	I'm not original tonight.
8334844	8336125	Ghetto Game Dispenser.
8336165	8337346	Well, he has something to hold your games.
8337846	8343569	And I said that he will be showing how to build a feeding tube for your PSP.
8344370	8345751	Unfortunately, not a match.
8347712	8356998	So, it's all tied up at 0-0, which means, unfortunately, LemonLimeJump and Zaku have both lost tonight.
8358679	8358899	Aww.
8359399	8361921	But that's okay, because that means they get to split the loot!
8361941	8362001	Yes!
8362677	8364799	Yay, so Lemon Lime Jump, you still win.
8364999	8365620	Aren't you happy?
8366341	8366861	Wow.
8367001	8369744	Alright, since I have you on the line, that was a genuine excitement.
8369984	8370304	Wow.
8371125	8372186	Lemon Lime Jump, what do you want?
8372206	8377751	Do you want the Resident Evil 4 CD, or do you want the NBA 2005 CD?
8379773	8381775	Resident Evil, because I was... wait.
8383717	8384558	Decisions, decisions.
8386520	8386780	Yeah.
8386800	8386880	Yeah.
8387563	8388824	Alright, Resident Evil.
8388844	8390326	She's taking the Resident Evil 4 soundtrack.
8390766	8392468	Zaku, you don't go home a loser.
8392488	8394670	You get the NBA 2005 soundtrack.
8394690	8395611	Thanks so much for playing.
8396071	8396552	Let me line jump.
8396572	8397713	I'll be in touch and chat, alright?
8398794	8399194	Alright, thanks.
8399214	8399574	Have a good one.
8399614	8400375	I need to get your address.
8400395	8400916	Have a good one.
8400936	8401536	Thanks for playing.
8403378	8403778	Later.
8404219	8404719	You're welcome.
8404759	8405200	Bye.
8408343	8410645	I liked her wow was the best part of that whole segment.
8410705	8411085	Wow.
8412567	8412867	Alright.
8417327	8424809	I was hoping that it was a woman, because I called her a her, and if it was a guy, that would have been really bad.
8424829	8429249	Are you saying she sounds like a man?
8429269	8431390	No, I'm saying that some guys, some kids sound like women.
8431490	8436231	Most of our listeners are males, so it's nice to have some more females listening to the program.
8436811	8439071	Alright, let's go to a break.
8439091	8442252	When we come back from break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.
8443192	8444453	Dig through those Legos, Loki.
8446153	8446493	I will.
8447679	8449401	All right, we'll be back after this.
8449421	8450402	We're going to start it off.
8450622	8452163	We're going to do just a mix of music here.
8452504	8456087	Start it off with some AM3P from Old School DDR.
8456107	8459790	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and the FUs of the Week and more.
8460071	8460491	Stay tuned.

8885825	8886526	sucks!
8886606	8892475	Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!
8895356	8902064	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 137 on this Easter Sunday, March 27, 2005.
8902805	8905208	On what has been quite an interesting show tonight.
8905268	8906769	Very interesting vibe going on tonight.
8906789	8909132	We had some good calls on the Skype line a little earlier tonight.
8909893	8913077	Actually getting out the DDR mat and playing Ultramix live on air.
8913257	8914438	First CD I've played in a month.
8914658	8915539	I'm always looking.
8915579	8916240	I'm always looking.
8940794	8947156	Which is weird because I was hearing these stories about, oh my gosh, PSPs are sold out everywhere and you can't get one no matter what.
8947956	8949296	Yeah, mic down.
8949376	8949836	Get down a mic.
8950437	8951097	Hey, Lego boy.
8951617	8952077	Get down a mic.
8955118	8964780	The only reason we would have any left is because some weren't picked up by the fools who laid down $50 and just decided they didn't want them.
8965200	8965720	$50 reserve.
8965740	8965980	$50 deposit.
8966000	8966060	Wow.
8969079	8970280	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
8989125	8992407	And do these people get their $50 back or no?
8992787	9000711	Yeah, a GameStop reservation is totally refundable, unlike an EB reservation that they make you spend in the store because EB sucks.
9003353	9005914	Now we have some EB employees that listen to this show, so be nice.
9005934	9006534	They can suck it.
9006635	9008155	Be nice, be nice.
9009276	9010557	Can't we all just get along?
9010597	9011677	They're babies, you know.
9012037	9013218	That's what EB stands for.
9016340	9018302	Isn't there enough hate in this world?
9018422	9018802	No.
9018862	9020844	I want to spread love here on Orange Lounge.
9021124	9023126	GameStop and EB should come together in harmony.
9023346	9024847	And then Best Buy could join in.
9025327	9026148	But not Walmart.
9026408	9026949	Not Walmart.
9026969	9027549	Walmart's evil.
9028850	9029531	Screw EB.
9030572	9031492	Screw GameCrazy.
9033612	9036873	Don't screw the people who work there because they suffer just like I do.
9053599	9057120	You obviously didn't come to my store where we've had assloads of them forever.
9057700	9058140	I didn't.
9058620	9060861	As well as red octane ignition pads.
9061041	9064121	But I ended up going to the GameStop up the street and I did pick up Ultramix 2 there.
9064261	9066582	They just didn't have it at my usual GameStop up the street.
9067322	9067822	Thank you.
9067982	9068462	Thank you, Dan.
9071743	9072243	All right.
9073423	9074023	We do a little segment.
9074043	9081865	We're going to get into the FUs of the week here shortly, but before we get into that, we're going to get into a segment we like to do here on the show called the...
9082415	9083176	No, not FNA.
9083436	9086819	We're going to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
9087760	9089242	I know, it's the kitties one.
9090363	9091964	Oh, I don't have the kitties one, actually.
9091984	9092645	It's in the imaging form.
9092685	9095408	It's everyone posting pictures of their cats.
9097510	9098691	No, it's not the kitty post.
9098711	9101854	Was there enough room on the desktop for that?
9102134	9103335	Oh, you need to shut up.
9103495	9103816	All right.
9105086	9108107	Those of you guys listening to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, welcome.
9108167	9120789	And DDR Freak, for those that may not know, because I think some of our new listeners may be unfamiliar with DDR, it's the largest website out there dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution, the video game that really started us off.
9121109	9124590	Although we're about gaming in general now, DDR is really what started us off.
9124630	9128690	So we still show our love to DDR Freak by honoring their post of the week.
9128990	9130851	And you know it's got a forum with, what, like 50,000 users?
9132944	9136265	So there's always somebody interesting posting.
9137806	9139387	By interesting, you mean stupid, right?
9139967	9140747	I wasn't going to say that.
9142408	9144749	I just got a call as I see it.
9144829	9151792	I actually had a hard time finding a really stupid post this week, so I found a WTF post.
9152592	9153052	So here it is.
9153412	9160775	This was in the DDR console games section, and the subject is, Is anyone this desperate?
9161836	9162516	Here's the message.
9163975	9170977	I am now starting to create step charts on my games that aren't the right songs that go with the song.
9171437	9175438	Like I created PS on Max 300 for DDR Max.
9175958	9179499	I'm going to also make Cartoon Heroes and Across the Nightmare.
9179879	9184201	When I do this, I have the music mute or just have claps in training mode.
9184481	9186861	Does anyone else do this or am I just weird?
9188342	9188862	Just weird.
9190717	9197759	So if I'm understanding that post correctly, he mutes the TV.
9198479	9200320	The whole point of DDR is to dance to the song.
9200340	9202260	He mutes the TV and creates his own stuff.
9202300	9205721	He has step charts for songs that aren't in the game.
9206001	9211803	They did this a long-ass time ago when The Legend of Max was coming out and stuff like that.
9212243	9218405	They were making Max on dropout and stuff and putting the steps on there to prepare for it and stuff.
9218905	9219845	This has been done before.
9224505	9227486	I did that to an edit that I made once just to listen to it.
9228267	9231868	Because you remember my really evil one that I did to DXY?
9232548	9233709	The another edit?
9234109	9235149	It just sounded really cool.
9237610	9244293	I just... People really, really badly want Cartoon Heroes and USDDR.
9244333	9247154	They will go to great lengths to get this song in DDR.
9247595	9248955	It's just a song, guys.
9249636	9250536	It's just a song.
9251554	9253395	If it really means that much to you, pay the money.
9253455	9254535	Get an import PlayStation.
9254575	9255236	I don't know what to tell you.
9257256	9257636	All right.
9259777	9266700	Let's go to another segment we like to do here called the FUs of the Week.
9268301	9270302	And what do we do during the FUs of the Week?
9270322	9271162	We get ranty.
9271622	9274803	We do this every single week for you folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio.
9275203	9276304	We set a bunch of people on fire.
9276860	9277040	Yes.
9277401	9277661	All right.
9278382	9281766	So it's just a chance for us to kind of unload a little bit and feel better by venting.
9282387	9285511	So, DarkSakura, why is it we have to do this every single week?
9303881	9309402	Um, you know, I don't really have too much in the way of angst tonight, being that I'm in a generally good mood.
9310242	9311602	But, you know what, Rob?
9313223	9313443	What?
9314143	9315903	A big F you go to your bathroom.
9316983	9318063	That's all I'm gonna say.
9319824	9320164	Alright.
9320604	9322704	Um, oh yeah, an idiot's on the road.
9323904	9324345	That's it?
9325525	9326905	Yeah, cause I'm in a generally good mood.
9327165	9328725	Wow, that's amazing.
9329185	9329405	Yeah.
9329865	9332766	Okay, well let's move on then to Loki.
9335578	9344808	Um, first off, I'd like to say, um, fuck him at work for taking so long to get back to me on whether or not I have this job.
9344848	9350455	I understand that you're busy, like, interviewing people because they keep stealing people out of your department, but, you know, I would like to know.
9350919	9351499	Thank you for watching!
9368471	9369132	But I'm gonna live.
9371353	9377376	Also, fuck you drivers because there are so many bad drivers out there that are not paying attention.
9378396	9379797	Even though most of them seem to be women.
9380337	9381998	And, ow!
9382799	9387521	Nelly gives an F you to me for saying that, and she also gives an F you to me for playing with my Legos.
9389883	9391784	And F you to the lack of pie from her.
9393905	9394205	I'm done.
9402096	9406077	I'd like to give an F you to the local pizza places for not being open today.
9406837	9415119	I realize that it's Easter and it's a religious holiday and people are spending time with their families and yada yada, but I put in my time with my family this morning.
9415519	9416319	And you know what?
9416359	9417799	You pizza people can do that too.
9417839	9422680	It's putting your time in the morning and then be there to make me a pizza in the evening because I'm lazy and I don't cook.
9423120	9423901	Not even on Easter.
9424181	9424821	So, sorry.
9427390	9433594	Also an F you to the fact that I did not get a single piece of candy today being Easter.
9434074	9441779	I went the whole day without a single... F you to not getting two pieces of candy today on Easter.
9443279	9443780	I forgot.
9443800	9445181	Nelly did give me a peanut butter cup.
9445221	9445621	My bad.
9446441	9450244	An F you to myself for being a forgetful jerk and making myself sound like an ass on the radio.
9450304	9450644	Thank you.
9452825	9453125	One more.
9453145	9455867	F you to Rob for making me play the dancing game.
9456554	9459295	and Get Tired, because I'm out of shape.
9461475	9463976	Wait until the picture shows up in the paper, then you can give me an FU.
9465296	9474519	And I would like to give an FU to... An FU to having to wait to find out if I'm going to get this new apartment or not.
9475139	9476199	Because I don't like waiting.
9476779	9477379	Waiting sucks.
9478440	9481280	Alright, let's go on to other folks and their FUs.
9481300	9483321	We'll start it off with DDR Angel.
9484950	9496278	FU to not being able to find my expansion discs for Final Fantasy XI because, I don't know, I just want to install it all at once and then, you know, do that massive patch download and then just play.
9496358	9503442	I don't want to, you know, have to find the discs later and install them and crap because no.
9504023	9504683	Just no.
9504983	9508986	Because that means more downloading patches later and I'd rather just do it all at once.
9510727	9514570	FU to running out of spring break because I want more but,
9515396	9517097	I have school this week, so damn it.
9518657	9524779	And I'm going to not play DDR more because I really lost my stamina and I really want it back, so that means I'm going to play more.
9526300	9527320	Yeah.
9528360	9528921	More to come later.
9529001	9529161	Bye.
9530621	9532102	Does Dan the Man have any FUs?
9532982	9534542	Let's hear some FUs from Dan the Man.
9534983	9535923	Can we get Dan the Man to mic?
9536523	9536783	Loki.
9537784	9538124	FUs.
9538264	9538424	Sorry.
9538444	9539724	Do you have any FUs of the week, Dan the Man?
9541205	9541865	Not few to me.
9543089	9544210	I'm addicted to Lumines.
9545510	9549932	An F you to Rob for making me look away from Lumines to answer this question.
9550973	9554394	And an F you to Sony for shoddy quality control and dead pixels.
9555014	9555975	Fix the fucking problem!
9557275	9557676	Fix it!
9560217	9560497	Thank you.
9561137	9561958	You're welcome.
9563758	9564339	Back to my game.
9566700	9569521	Let's get to chatroom FUs.
9571593	9578838	Legend of Zaku says, F you to not being able to find a Konami 2DX controller, new or used, for around $50 to $60.
9578938	9580239	Well, that's part of the problem.
9581080	9584782	F you to Old Man Winter for making it the coldest winter ever for New York.
9585002	9589225	F you to my ever so shitty stamina for holding me back from playing 9-footers in DDR.
9589746	9592908	And F you to sucking horribly at playing 2DX in the arcades.
9594845	9599249	Dark Tetsuya says, a continued FU to G4 for killing off the screensavers.
9599769	9603513	An FU to whatever corrupted my extreme US data several months of work.
9603853	9604193	Gone.
9605895	9610459	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to my job for opening on Easter Sunday.
9611340	9616404	Know that the rest of the mall was closed, so we were the only store in the mall open today and it was slow.
9618806	9623548	SSJ 100 Matt says, F you not being able to get into the anime convention in Arizona.
9623588	9628971	It turns out they only let 850 people in, thus shutting out hundreds of anime fans.
9629171	9631032	Wow, that is poor planning.
9631712	9632693	I would have been pissed.
9633873	9634433	Shame, shame.
9635214	9637775	Real quick, I'd like to give an F you to see herpes.
9639236	9640376	I just see herpes.
9644221	9647484	If herpes is coming from lobsters, quit ruining the show.
9647644	9648645	I'm just kidding.
9648785	9652388	SS2100Matt also says, F you to Golfland for closing the arcade.
9652708	9654269	The only day I have off.
9655390	9658412	And for Ivan Drago killing Apollo Creed.
9658793	9661795	Gotta love the never-ending Rocky movie marathon on AMC.
9666759	9671603	LemonLimeJump says, F you to websites that don't show up properly in Firefox.
9675039	9685623	BlackDevilerX says F you to the fact that I haven't been able to listen lately F you to the fact that it's Easter and I didn't get any candy at all Are you sure somebody didn't secretly give you a peanut butter cup?
9685743	9687684	Because they'll be really ticked off if they hear that
9689119	9697805	DJ Tyrant says, F you to Spring Break, being only one week, knowing almost for certain that I won't be qualifying at RDC in San Diego for In The Groove.
9698205	9705631	World of Warcraft taking over my life, 2DX9 style not at my house yet, Electric Avenue not upgrading to 2DX Red, and school.
9706131	9717579	Sephiroth 1215 says, F you for 1 gig memory sticks being so damn expensive, and to Best Buy for still not sending out my Lumines, forcing me to play Metal Gear, which is cool, but can get tiring.
9718249	9721150	and they are telling me that I'm mispronouncing Lumines.
9721210	9723270	It's actually Luminous.
9723350	9723710	Don't care.
9725051	9725331	Sorry.
9727051	9728491	I like Lumines better.
9729271	9730552	Luminous.
9733612	9734593	Maybe it's the French.
9734613	9735053	I don't know.
9735093	9735633	Whatever.
9735713	9736373	I like Lumines.
9736393	9738193	If I didn't know it was French, I'd write it as Luminous.
9738434	9740414	Not us, it would be F.
9741795	9744658	Illusion says, F you to last week's robot, tomato, tomato.
9745078	9748862	Illusion says, F you to last week's robot, chicken, for sucking all kinds of ass.
9748962	9751244	I swear I didn't laugh even once.
9751725	9754488	You know what, this last week wasn't nearly as good as the past week.
9754548	9765358	Honestly, this week, a rumor from what I heard, because I know they have a segment in there that's called Kill Bunny, and I know they're going to be playing it today because it's Easter, and it's Jesus.
9766099	9770161	as the bride from Kill Bill, Killing the Easter Bunny in Santa Claus.
9770721	9771501	Gotta love that.
9771661	9772722	How you gonna top that?
9772922	9773842	Okay.
9773862	9774202	11.30 tonight.
9775323	9777023	If you're on the East Coast, you gotta TiVo it.
9777063	9780184	You know, we need to make them pay for those ads, you know?
9780905	9781345	I can't help it.
9781365	9782185	The show kicks ass.
9783086	9786187	Illusion also says, F you to being sick and missing one day of school.
9786267	9790188	I was so close to getting a perfect attendance certificate, and I didn't get it because of sickness.
9790428	9790608	Agh.
9791109	9793750	Oh, and all your bases are belong to Robotron 2002.
9798485	9804547	MPQ says F you to myself for knowing some obscure kanji that a lot of Japanese people don't when I can't speak any Japanese.
9805107	9808848	F you to Sampling Masters Mega for making a really catchy song that I can't find.
9809508	9812969	F you to that PSP golf game I pre-ordered that doesn't come out until June.
9813609	9818410	And I guess F you to that Stepmania theme for changing the pi that I was looking for.
9819511	9819931	P-I?
9820051	9820351	Pi?
9820371	9820711	I don't know.
9821673	9826756	DJ Ranma S says, Fuck you to the Parks Department for canceling our photoshoot in Central Park.
9827137	9829859	Permit my ass, I'm sending Manfe after you.
9830759	9832941	Manfe, sorry.
9832981	9836423	John Field says, F you to being lazy and not catching up on my schoolwork.
9838424	9846170	Rice, RYC3, says, F you to Planet X slash GameStop for the longest fucking line I've been in at the mall for the PSP.
9846250	9846630	The end.
9846670	9847130	Hi, guys.
9848971	9849612	And lastly...
9851522	9856463	DJ Takuya says, F you for not having a 2DX machine in Virginia.
9856483	9859264	And if I horribly mispronounced your name, my bad.
9863265	9868066	Another F you segment bites the dust.
9869627	9869947	All right.
9870512	9876054	We're going to do a quickie break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge, and then we're going to wrap it up.
9876134	9884596	So, send some questions to Sky in the chat room with any questions you have for us, and we will get to them when we come back from this break, featuring... Huh?
9887697	9890918	Well, I already played Lemmings during that few, so we'll do the In the Groove thing later.
9891299	9894720	We'll do some Taku, start it off, and we'll be back after this.
9895280	9897060	A couple songs, just two songs this break.
9897300	9899021	With Ask Orange Lounge, we'll be back.
9901623	9902430	Thanks for watching!
9947631	9948712	DarkSakura.com
10010302	10013064	And in the midst of all these troubled comics...
10091256	10092377	Thanks for watching!
10139549	10145416	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
10150643	10151103	Ask Orange Lounge
10180883	10182905	Me putting in the chatroom how you ask questions.
10183105	10184025	But somebody will fill you in.
10184226	10185366	We have some nice people in chat.
10191630	10194572	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10195093	10198295	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
10198755	10205760	Something people want to know is will we tone it down because we got nominated Broadcaster of the Year and my answer is HELL NO!
10210953	10215239	No, seriously, somebody was... And for those who want to know, yes, the song is supposed to suck that bad.
10218676	10222457	Somebody in chat actually asked me, are you guys toning it down tonight because of the Broadcaster of the Year thing?
10222497	10225498	And I'm like, no, we're just kind of, I don't know.
10226439	10228399	It's the ham, the sedatives in the ham.
10228459	10231741	Yeah, actually, I think it is because we've all eaten really well today.
10231861	10235162	Even though we did not get pie, we ate very well.
10235202	10235722	Sorry, Nelly.
10236062	10236882	Don't make pouty face.
10237723	10241244	We've all eaten very well, so I think we're just a little happier today.
10242024	10244345	Nelly has... Please put that on camera.
10244905	10249510	OrangeSongsRadio.com Nelly will be showing her LEGO creations there on cam.
10249730	10254194	We have a lot of freaking questions to get to in very little time, so let's get to it.
10256156	10262762	DJ Takuya says, What are your thoughts on the flyer announcing 2DX12 Happy Sky?
10264364	10265605	My thought is I like the name.
10266243	10268444	But, um, you know what?
10268504	10269264	It's just a flyer.
10269644	10274626	I can't really start forming opinions until I see, like, some more screenshots and some song titles.
10274746	10275426	That's my opinion.
10275926	10277266	Anybody else care to interject?
10279147	10281588	I have to say, I love the flyer so far.
10281808	10284589	I just hope the timing on the flyer is still pretty good.
10285289	10289610	The only kickass about that flyer is so goddamn versatile.
10290851	10295332	Paper Wad, Paper Airplane, little, like, you know, Pac-Man thing.
10296553	10310597	DJ Takuya also wants to know, what do you think is the future of 2DX for the console with PS3 looming in the future?
10325999	10327520	Any thoughts on that, DarkSakura?
10355365	10359728	I don't even want to think about the future systems until I actually have something tangible on them.
10360349	10362510	So speculation, I'm not going to.
10363491	10363811	Alright.
10368094	10368655	Oh, Dan the Man.
10368795	10373038	And remember, generally the Bimani games are real slow to adapt to new hardware.
10373618	10377121	Since the PS3 will be backwards compatible...
10378166	10387393	Unless they do something crazy go nuts with the arcade version, you can probably expect to see it playable on PS2 for a good long time until they absolutely have to start making it for PS3.
10387674	10388674	Okay.
10389815	10390256	Good point.
10391717	10393959	Alright, let's go to a question from BlackDevilerX.
10394499	10396280	What piece is Loki missing?
10396561	10400764	I downloaded the zip from the site and noticed that I have a lot of the special pieces.
10400884	10402045	Maybe he can describe it.
10403169	10405632	I don't want to hear what special pieces Loki's missing from his list.
10405652	10407493	Yeah, how is the Lego construction going over there?
10407513	10414280	It's the one that looks like a seat, and I'm on step four right now, because I've started running out of black pieces.
10414781	10424570	And again, for those that tuned in late tonight's show, Loki is building a charger for the Nintendo DS out of Legos, and that's something that's actually on the website over at www.orangenautoradio.com.
10424630	10426632	I have a question for anyone in our chat room.
10426793	10427093	Okay.
10427560	10433323	How do I freaking download streaming movies as to permanently non-streaming, like recording them?
10434404	10435244	It's driving me nuts.
10435844	10438205	Send a private message over to DarkSakura if you know the answer.
10438225	10439186	I'm sure she'll appreciate it.
10439706	10441047	She'll love you forever and ever.
10441927	10444589	Or send us a copy of the Star Wars 3.
10444629	10449111	Or send me a freaking non-streaming copy of that new video.
10454114	10454654	Let's see...
10457170	10460412	Yes, yes, Loki, comment on episode 3 trailer since it came out.
10460432	10464295	There is a downloadable version out there, you just have to find it because I have it on my computer at work.
10466417	10466697	Alright.
10467698	10474563	RPGKing7, RPGKing7 wants to know, my question is for everyone in studio and in the chat room.
10475023	10478726	Can anyone give me any good cosplay websites, please?
10479166	10483589	I was asked for a job interview I have to cosplay a favorite movie character.
10483609	10484029	Interesting.
10484250	10484650	Interesting.
10485852	10487374	That's a hell of an interview, I've got to say.
10487394	10489155	But okay, good cosplay tips.
10489676	10491117	Well, who's your favorite movie character?
10491137	10491478	Jeez.
10493439	10494881	Go to the thrift store.
10494901	10495521	Modify.
10495581	10497283	But the question is about cosplay websites.
10497303	10499605	Are there any good cosplay websites that might have tips?
10499925	10500626	Cosplay.com?
10500906	10501447	Is there really one?
10502187	10502408	Okay.
10502788	10506251	Or you can order some of those cosplay magazines that they have.
10506271	10507232	Do you know any of the names of any of them?
10509177	10509558	I don't know.
10509858	10516023	And there's also, I think, Cospa.net or .co.jp is C-O-S-P-A.
10516103	10517344	It's a Japanese cosplay site.
10517984	10519625	But they have individual pieces there.
10520146	10520386	Oh, okay.
10520406	10521987	You can see what they look like.
10522087	10524449	Hopefully some folks in the chat room can help out with that, too.
10524930	10527632	You know, you can sometimes find costume pieces on eBay.
10527832	10529293	They sell everything on eBay.
10529333	10529994	It's pretty crazy.
10530454	10532495	Loki, any help with the cosplay question?
10532796	10533456	No, I need it.
10533476	10534457	Yeah, that's what I thought.
10535003	10535323	All right.
10535523	10536004	Good luck, bud.
10538786	10539486	Get that job.
10540147	10544950	If you're going to dress up as a movie character, dress up as... What did they call her?
10545010	10547672	What was the name of the diva from the fifth element?
10550254	10551155	The blue... The diva.
10551315	10551755	The diva?
10551795	10552376	Was that just her name?
10552416	10553096	I thought she had a name.
10553656	10554357	Dress up as her.
10555518	10555818	All right.
10556398	10556919	Illusion.
10558616	10564148	I heard a rumor that DJ Potatoes Company will be publishing the next frequency game.
10564208	10565611	Have you heard anything about this?
10567926	10569087	I don't think there is a company.
10569708	10578434	The closest thing I think you might be thinking of is Neon FM, and the reason why it might be getting mixed up with frequency is because Freeze Pop is showing up in Neon FM.
10578754	10580855	You can look at the website neonfm.com.
10581696	10585278	But I don't know of any frequency amplitude thing that he's involved with.
10585398	10589281	I mean, I guess anything's possible, but a rumor's a rumor as far as I'm concerned.
10589421	10590582	Loki, do you have anything you want to add to that?
10590602	10595045	I honestly didn't know he had a company.
10596127	10597607	Prava Laguna was the name of the D.Va.
10627454	10627794	Thank you.
10631496	10635959	SSJ100Matt What's a good price to whore yourself?
10637160	10638641	We'll answer just about anything on here.
10639182	10644545	I spent all my money on the PSP this week and I need money slash zenny slash gil.
10646603	10648506	How are you going to get Gil by being a whore?
10648526	10650629	Are you going to whore out your character in Final Fantasy XI?
10650930	10652933	I've actually seen people do this in Final Fantasy XI.
10652953	10657940	They play the little Taru characters, and then they'll say, We'll do the panic dance for 100 Gil.
10661161	10662501	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10688228	10689708	Don't whore yourself for a PSP.
10689768	10690488	It's not worth it.
10690889	10693349	PSPs are nice and all, but don't whore yourself for one.
10693689	10694509	Totally worth it.
10694649	10695530	Whore yourself out.
10695930	10697370	A buck a pop if you have to.
10697650	10698450	Get a PSP.
10699270	10700050	What's the standard?
10700551	10701371	50 for a BJ?
10702211	10703271	I think it's inflation.
10703291	10705432	50 for an HJ, 100 for a BJ.
10706632	10707932	Sucky, fucky, five bucky.
10711093	10711733	You know what?
10711833	10712033	Just...
10712702	10718125	Go on the internet and answer a personal ad from a sugar daddy or a sugar mommy, maybe.
10718145	10721026	You might even be able to find an old lady sugar mommy, depending on what you're into.
10722427	10725429	And then you can get anything you want just by putting out.
10725469	10727130	And you only have to put out for one person.
10728310	10732712	And if it is a sugar mommy, chances are she doesn't have the organs to reproduce anymore.
10732793	10735634	They've stopped working a while ago, so you might luck out.
10737375	10738536	Why did I answer that question?
10740617	10741117	I'm an idiot.
10743314	10747218	Let's see, we've got a lot of questions tonight, so I'm trying to get through some of them here.
10747318	10757029	Jaded2005 wants to know, my girlfriend who is listening wants to know, hi girlfriend who's listening, wants to know how did you come up with your name?
10757549	10759091	How did we come up with the Orange Launch Radio name?
10759231	10759591	Guilty!
10760593	10762755	Yes, DarkSakura, how did that work?
10765038	10769742	Basically, DDR Freak Radio was taken, actually.
10769782	10779749	We were trying to think of Bimani-sounding station names, and Orange Lounge came out just because of lounge music, blah, blah, blah.
10779949	10780850	And we were bored on the part.
10782038	10782879	Thank you for watching!
10804161	10805302	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10822894	10835838	People think that we're our lounge music station, like we sit here and we play lounge music, and don't get me wrong, lounge music's pretty rad, but we're actually video game radio, so it kind of throws people, they're like, whoa, I was expecting lounge music, what's this geeky stuff?
10838119	10843981	I wish we had a more interesting story than that, but that's really just it, we just picked a Bomani-related name for our show.
10846269	10848712	Maybe we can fit in one more question.
10849193	10850535	We'll do it from Legend of Zaku.
10850575	10852878	And sorry to those of you guys that also submitted questions.
10852938	10853899	We didn't get to them tonight.
10854019	10854520	I apologize.
10854540	10855381	We'll get to them next week.
10855582	10856122	Send them in later.
10856643	10858466	Legend of Zaku wants to know, so...
10859449	10864952	Now that you're moving, and Orange Lounge Radio might have its own room, how do you plan to design it?
10865412	10867153	Are you going to use a ferret theme?
10889620	10891040	Maybe, you know what I should do?
10891361	10892501	This would be a great idea.
10893121	10895542	Allow the listeners to send us decorations.
10895662	10898583	That way, I don't have to worry about it, and people buy me stuff.
10898763	10899363	I like that idea.
10899403	10900563	That's an excellent idea.
10900623	10901563	I think that's a great idea.
10901683	10904664	So, the listeners will be decorating the walls of the new studio.
10904724	10905365	I like that idea.
10907505	10908745	We'll give you guys details on that later.
10910606	10910966	Thank you.
10911466	10914207	And, yes, actually, the ferret will be hanging from a noose on the ceiling.
10914647	10917428	Just high enough so that Dark Sakura can't reach it.
10920555	10923316	Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.
10923356	10926377	Thank you guys very much for submitting your questions.
10928337	10931098	And that's just about it for tonight's show, you guys.
10931598	10932679	We're just about out of time.
10933279	10935279	Thanks so much for tuning in tonight and listening.
10935480	10936720	We hope you had a good time.
10937760	10940201	We're gonna go around now and get everybody's final thought.
10941181	10942562	DDR Angel, your final thought.
10944362	10945703	More DDR this week, please.
10945903	10946303	Just kidding.
10946643	10947583	I can do it on my own, I guess.
10948904	10950324	Dan the Man, your final thought.
10950911	10951891	Bust Kill Brain.
10953432	10954433	Loki, your final thought.
10958595	10960736	My final thought is I'm running out of black pieces.
10963917	10964497	It's almost done!
10964978	10965298	Woo!
10965558	10965858	Bye.
10966680	10971203	My final thought is I'm really craving a marshmallow peep right now.
10971303	10972344	And no, I'm not going to microwave it.
10973905	10975906	Oh, and I get to touch the PSP.
