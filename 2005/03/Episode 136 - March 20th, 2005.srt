00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:17,217
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

00:13:48,856 --> 00:13:52,659
[SPEAKER_02]: for the next break I will do some forest style music just to make you happy what?

87
00:13:56,962 --> 00:14:11,492
[SPEAKER_08]: oh my god I finally did the little flash game on the grudge site and it's kind of spooky speaking of Japanese movies that became American movies did you get a chance to go see Ring 2 yet?

88
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,233
[SPEAKER_02]: no I hear it's crap

89
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:17,429
[SPEAKER_02]: Which makes me sad, because the first one is seriously one of the greatest horror movies.

90
00:14:17,449 --> 00:14:19,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Because it hardly deviated from the original.

91
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,891
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to go see it, but I'm still waiting for Darkwater.

92
00:14:24,391 --> 00:14:26,952
[SPEAKER_08]: But I want to buy the book first.

93
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:29,853
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so happy, because Loop is going to be out soon.

94
00:14:30,273 --> 00:14:30,513
[SPEAKER_24]: Really?

95
00:14:31,154 --> 00:14:36,735
[SPEAKER_08]: Loop is the third book in the Ring series, which, if you read the books, it goes in a completely different direction.

96
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:41,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Although, from watching the trailers of Ring 2, it sort of seems like a tie-in, almost.

97
00:14:41,557 --> 00:14:41,697
[SPEAKER_18]: Hmm.

98
00:14:42,401 --> 00:14:43,542
[SPEAKER_08]: I am smart, S-M-R-T, smart

00:15:07,955 --> 00:15:11,078
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I got you the Harry Potter book and you never read it.

100
00:15:11,218 --> 00:15:12,840
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I, now wait a minute.

101
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I read two chapters.

102
00:15:14,441 --> 00:15:14,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me a break.

103
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:16,463
[SPEAKER_20]: That's not, no.

104
00:15:17,844 --> 00:15:19,846
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I do want to read Harry Potter someday.

105
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:20,947
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... You can read.

106
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, uh, starting off... Up, up, up, up, up, up.

107
00:15:26,412 --> 00:15:28,674
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, whoa, whoa.

108
00:15:28,815 --> 00:15:30,016
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off tonight's show...

00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,362
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

111
00:15:58,402 --> 00:15:59,163
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, who cares, right?

112
00:15:59,183 --> 00:15:59,804
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that mean?

113
00:16:00,065 --> 00:16:04,934
[SPEAKER_02]: We are taking the first step in becoming a legitimate business operation.

114
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:12,165
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have our paparazzi.

115
00:16:28,935 --> 00:16:33,118
[SPEAKER_02]: and we decided, you know, we ought to actually settle these things with like a DDR match.

116
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:35,960
[SPEAKER_25]: I was about to say that too.

117
00:16:37,101 --> 00:16:41,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I also had suggested a cream corn wrestling cage match.

118
00:16:41,464 --> 00:16:42,565
[SPEAKER_08]: If it's chess, I'll win.

119
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:44,627
[SPEAKER_02]: He totally will win.

120
00:16:44,667 --> 00:16:45,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I suck at chess.

121
00:16:45,327 --> 00:16:45,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm horrible.

122
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:49,570
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so we're officially on our way.

123
00:16:49,831 --> 00:16:56,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Which you know that means because we are officially becoming a business you can expect pop-ups to be coming to the site effective tomorrow.

124
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:56,996
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

125
00:16:57,472 --> 00:16:59,613
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you, we will not be having pop-up ads on the site.

126
00:16:59,973 --> 00:17:00,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Pop-up ads are evil.

127
00:17:01,494 --> 00:17:04,595
[SPEAKER_02]: And half of you guys have them blocked anyway, so what good would it do anyway?

128
00:17:05,756 --> 00:17:07,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So, congratulations to us.

129
00:17:08,577 --> 00:17:08,977

[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't Curves the place that plays Jesus music while you work out?

[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I heard they play Jesus music.

154
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:17,204
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's why my mom stopped going.

155
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:19,065
[SPEAKER_08]: No, this is the one downtown.

156
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:20,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well I guess maybe it's different.

157
00:18:20,925 --> 00:18:25,107
[SPEAKER_08]: It depends on which one you go to because I think they're sort of, I think they're franchised.

158
00:18:25,767 --> 00:18:26,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well maybe that's it then.

159
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,268
[SPEAKER_08]: But this one was downtown.

160
00:18:29,355 --> 00:18:30,235
[SPEAKER_08]: It was kind of neat.

161
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:34,797
[SPEAKER_08]: It wasn't, you know, the exercise I need, but I still got a workout out of it.

162
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:42,139
[SPEAKER_08]: But it uses resistance machines and then these bouncy things that you hop up and down on in between doing the resistance machines.

163
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:46,201
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're only doing this like 15, 30 seconds each time.

164
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:50,342
[SPEAKER_08]: But as you go through a couple of circuits of it, you're like, ooh, tired.

165
00:18:51,422 --> 00:18:54,103
[SPEAKER_08]: But it wasn't really, I was tired but not like fatigued.

166
00:18:54,363 --> 00:18:55,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Not like I'm supposed to be.

167
00:18:55,604 --> 00:18:56,224
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't hurt.

168
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:58,625
[SPEAKER_08]: And unless it hurts...

169
00:18:59,741 --> 00:19:00,862
[SPEAKER_08]: For me, it's not a workout.

170
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:06,327
[SPEAKER_08]: So, um, today I played like three hours of Silent Hill 3.

171
00:19:08,108 --> 00:19:09,649
[SPEAKER_08]: And sat around on my ass.

172
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,011
[SPEAKER_08]: And that was about it.

173
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:13,793
[SPEAKER_08]: It rained.

174
00:19:14,212 --> 00:19:14,912
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

175
00:19:41,570 --> 00:19:43,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Four modems, personally.

176
00:19:43,471 --> 00:19:44,772
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I sit back and laugh.

177
00:20:06,317 --> 00:20:09,258
[SPEAKER_02]: We got our first tornado, like, in ten years.

178
00:20:09,338 --> 00:20:11,558
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a tornado, like, two weeks ago.

179
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:14,479
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were freaking out, because it actually touched down.

180
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:20,321
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, I think it maybe, like, picked up a cow and moved it six feet, and that was, like, the extent of the damage.

181
00:20:20,861 --> 00:20:23,281
[SPEAKER_02]: But, yeah, I mean, people were freaking out.

182
00:20:23,301 --> 00:20:25,042
[SPEAKER_25]: They're like, oh my god, a tornado!

183
00:20:25,062 --> 00:20:30,783
[SPEAKER_25]: Just bear in mind, if we suddenly drop, just keep this mental image in mind.

184
00:20:30,803 --> 00:20:34,084
[SPEAKER_25]: We're all piled up in the bathtub, and Rob is on top.

185
00:20:35,342 --> 00:20:36,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you know it, I will be on top.

186
00:20:36,664 --> 00:20:38,626
[SPEAKER_08]: If we drop it means the tornado dropped a cow on us.

187
00:20:40,769 --> 00:20:42,531
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no place like Orange Lounge.

188
00:20:42,571 --> 00:20:43,953
[SPEAKER_27]: There's no place like Orange Lounge.

189
00:20:44,273 --> 00:20:45,355
[SPEAKER_20]: Auntie Em, Auntie Em.

190
00:20:47,136 --> 00:20:56,361
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wanted to say, I'm surprised by the news about Curves, because my mom stopped going there, because they were playing a lot of, like, Praise Jesus music.

191
00:20:56,901 --> 00:20:59,043
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe, well, she's too afraid to drive downtown.

192
00:20:59,083 --> 00:20:59,863
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other story.

193
00:21:00,363 --> 00:21:03,265
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really easy to get to, this particular one.

194
00:21:03,365 --> 00:21:10,009
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what you would call this, but my mom has a lot of Jewish friends, but she's not Jewish herself.

195
00:21:10,509 --> 00:21:11,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like a fag-hag.

196
00:21:12,270 --> 00:21:13,050
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

197
00:21:34,754 --> 00:21:39,998
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in Roseville, which I realize means nothing to you guys that are out there listening internationally.

198
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:45,982
[SPEAKER_02]: But imagine a town that is really white and has no culture whatsoever.

199
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:46,562
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Roseville.

200
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:49,605
[SPEAKER_08]: And you have to pay long distance to call into Sacramento.

201
00:21:50,045 --> 00:21:50,745
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, seriously.

202
00:21:50,825 --> 00:21:54,288
[SPEAKER_25]: Because they're so far removed from reality.

203
00:21:54,488 --> 00:21:57,370
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a Starbucks on every corner.

204
00:21:57,570 --> 00:21:59,091
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't know how else to put it.

205
00:22:00,432 --> 00:22:00,832
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

206
00:22:01,213 --> 00:22:01,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

207
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:06,387
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to keep going for the rest of the week just because I have a free week.

208
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:14,189
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to ask her though if she'll let me do a write-up on it because I'm wanting to promote more fitness for everybody.

209
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:18,391
[SPEAKER_08]: People need to get off their asses and actually do something for their health.

210
00:22:18,511 --> 00:22:30,414
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm hoping that I can do a nice write-up on it and encourage people that if... The good thing about this is that it's an all-women gym, so if you're feeling self-conscious...

211
00:22:31,997 --> 00:22:33,018
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

212
00:22:50,672 --> 00:22:56,834
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have to worry about a big gym full of people at different, because everybody is going to be at their own fitness level, but everybody is really supportive.

213
00:22:57,414 --> 00:23:05,917
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a really good place for someone who may be new to exercise, or looking just to lean up a bit, not necessarily bulk up, or is self-conscious.

214
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:12,619
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason why I was giggling is because they have a guys, they have an all-guy gymnasium called Cuts.

215
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,160
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's the same thing, I think.

216
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:15,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

217
00:23:37,298 --> 00:23:39,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just start with my week and my day since this kind of leads into it.

218
00:23:39,959 --> 00:23:45,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually apartment hunting today, scouting out where the new home of Orange Lawn Studios will be for a little while.

219
00:23:47,404 --> 00:23:48,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said you were done.

220
00:23:48,946 --> 00:23:50,367
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I went to go blow my nose.

221
00:23:50,487 --> 00:23:50,947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.

222
00:23:50,967 --> 00:23:52,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then go ahead and finish and I'll tell my piece.

223
00:23:53,523 --> 00:23:57,704
[SPEAKER_08]: The rest of it was spent working on my wedding, which I sent up for this online wedding thing.

224
00:23:58,284 --> 00:24:01,564
[SPEAKER_08]: They had me budgeted at $15,000, which I find incredibly retarded.

225
00:24:02,685 --> 00:24:03,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I chopped it down to $5,000.

226
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:08,866
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just for the essentials of having a very basic ceremony and paying for food.

227
00:24:10,766 --> 00:24:18,107
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I did some house hunting and found out that those online foreclosure sites suck.

228
00:24:18,827 --> 00:24:20,808
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to have to see about getting a bank list somewhere.

229
00:24:21,968 --> 00:24:22,508
[SPEAKER_08]: And now I'm done.

230
00:24:26,147 --> 00:24:29,428
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, oh yeah, apartment hunting.

231
00:24:29,708 --> 00:24:38,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I was apartment hunting today, and me and my buddy Christopher, you know, we're both, you know, if you haven't heard, I happen to be a gay male, and my buddy Christopher is also a gay male.

232
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:43,894
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think we exactly exude gay when we go out in public.

233
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:52,698
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I realize people figure me out after spending quality time with me, but I think when I go in in a professional setting, I don't think I'm like, you know...

234
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,059
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everybody!

235
00:24:54,199 --> 00:24:56,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I don't think I'm like Richard Simmons gay, okay?

236
00:24:57,423 --> 00:25:01,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think I'm pretty, you know, quote-unquote, just like everybody else.

237
00:25:01,227 --> 00:25:01,867
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how to say it.

238
00:25:02,989 --> 00:25:04,030
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on low heat, yes.

239
00:25:04,911 --> 00:25:08,294
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, if gayness was an oven setting, I'm like hold warm.

240
00:25:08,594 --> 00:25:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: That's me.

241
00:25:08,955 --> 00:25:09,716
[SPEAKER_02]: My flames are hold warm.

242
00:25:09,736 --> 00:25:10,697
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not like Lagerfeld.

243
00:25:11,297 --> 00:25:12,459
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm not like Karl Lagerfeld.

244
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:13,560
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have a fan.

245
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,702
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't carry a fucking fan or any of that stuff.

246
00:25:16,147 --> 00:25:20,652
[SPEAKER_25]: So... Well, we went to an apartment complex today.

247
00:25:21,773 --> 00:25:25,717
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we walked in, the guy was like, okay, what kind of size apartment are you interested in getting?

248
00:25:25,757 --> 00:25:27,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And we said, well, maybe like a two or three bedroom.

249
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,381
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, you guys don't want a one bedroom?

250
00:25:29,942 --> 00:25:32,505
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were like, uh, it's not like that.

251
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:34,367
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, okay.

252
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:39,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, he just assumed that we were together and we wanted a one-bedroom.

253
00:25:39,082 --> 00:25:45,306
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize that it's possible for heterosexual males to share a one-bedroom, like college, you know, things like that.

254
00:25:45,326 --> 00:25:46,206
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfectly normal.

255
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:51,950
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like once you get to be 26, you know, unless you're poor.

256
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:52,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Time to have your own bedroom.

257
00:25:52,871 --> 00:25:55,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's about time to get your own bedroom unless, you know, you're poor.

258
00:25:55,473 --> 00:25:58,915
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like to think I make reasonably good money where I can afford my own bedroom, and so does Christopher.

259
00:25:59,596 --> 00:26:00,076
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway.

260
00:26:00,695 --> 00:26:01,095
[SPEAKER_02]: My point.

261
00:26:02,116 --> 00:26:03,217
[SPEAKER_02]: He was giving us the tour.

262
00:26:03,277 --> 00:26:06,639
[SPEAKER_02]: So now we're straight in his minds because he offended us with the gay comment.

263
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:09,941
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were walking around and he showed us the gymnasium.

264
00:26:10,342 --> 00:26:12,423
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were these two girls and they were pretty attractive.

265
00:26:12,443 --> 00:26:14,925
[SPEAKER_02]: These two girls that were in the gymnasium work it out.

266
00:26:14,945 --> 00:26:17,607
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, yeah, we got girls that work out in this gym.

267
00:26:17,627 --> 00:26:19,428
[SPEAKER_02]: And the girls, like you could tell, were embarrassed.

268
00:26:20,248 --> 00:26:21,429
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, oh, those poor girls.

269
00:26:22,270 --> 00:26:25,172
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just wanted to tell them, you have nothing to worry about.

270
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:27,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not checking you out in that kind of way.

271
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:29,595
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm strictly looking at the equipment you're using.

272
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:31,226
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

273
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:58,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I got to play a little bit of In The Groove, which I've been playing a little more and more of.

274
00:26:58,492 --> 00:27:00,494
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really trying to warm up to In The Groove.

275
00:27:01,455 --> 00:27:03,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing's really changed on my opinion on it.

276
00:27:03,697 --> 00:27:11,363
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also played Beatmania 3, 6-mix, and I got to watch Andrew play Instant Love, which was the shit, because I love that song.

277
00:27:13,545 --> 00:27:17,288
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was pissed off because the two-player side, all the keys were broken, so I cannot play center mode.

278
00:27:17,688 --> 00:27:20,471
[SPEAKER_02]: And I am a turntable left kind of guy.

279
00:27:20,951 --> 00:27:25,754
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why Beatmania 5 Key Machines pissed me off because I have to play center and it's all weird.

280
00:27:26,195 --> 00:27:27,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But Left Pride, yo!

281
00:27:30,017 --> 00:27:30,778
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's my week.

282
00:27:30,798 --> 00:27:32,219
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything else interesting to share.

283
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,460
[SPEAKER_27]: Left Pride my ass.

284
00:27:34,801 --> 00:27:35,381
[SPEAKER_27]: You know what?

285
00:27:36,282 --> 00:27:38,003
[SPEAKER_27]: You want to settle this with a cream corn match?

286
00:27:39,218 --> 00:27:39,378
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

287
00:27:39,558 --> 00:27:41,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, this could be our first dispute.

288
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,901
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be our first official dispute.

289
00:27:44,962 --> 00:27:45,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

290
00:27:45,543 --> 00:27:47,704
[SPEAKER_25]: Wow, I feel all official and shit.

291
00:27:47,964 --> 00:27:49,586
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, let me go to the pantry and get some corn.

292
00:27:49,686 --> 00:27:50,446
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, you have a mic.

293
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:51,347
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about your week and your day.

294
00:27:52,368 --> 00:27:52,768
[SPEAKER_25]: Alright.

295
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,391
[SPEAKER_25]: Just, well, mostly all the same.

296
00:27:56,471 --> 00:27:58,452
[SPEAKER_25]: Work, school, work, school, work, school.

297
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:00,814
[SPEAKER_25]: Finally got sick of it.

298
00:28:00,934 --> 00:28:01,995
[SPEAKER_25]: Took a weekend off.

299
00:28:02,095 --> 00:28:05,477
[SPEAKER_25]: Went to Rekakon yesterday.

300
00:28:05,557 --> 00:28:06,458
[SPEAKER_25]: Shoutouts to everyone there.

301
00:28:07,442 --> 00:28:16,968
[SPEAKER_25]: Uh, came in day after just completely blowing my legs out on DDR, and the rest is going on right now.

302
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:19,750
[SPEAKER_25]: Nothing much to talk about, though.

303
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:24,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, how boring you are.

304
00:28:25,013 --> 00:28:25,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kidding.

305
00:28:26,354 --> 00:28:27,415
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a working boy now.

306
00:28:27,975 --> 00:28:31,137
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, this boy has grown up so fast, right before our eyes.

307
00:28:33,479 --> 00:28:33,799
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

308
00:28:35,731 --> 00:28:37,853
[SPEAKER_25]: I smell a repressed dot dot frickin dot.

309
00:28:37,913 --> 00:28:40,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when he was an angsty little Republican asshole?

310
00:28:41,476 --> 00:28:44,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Now he's only a semi-angsty Republican asshole.

311
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:46,219
[SPEAKER_08]: With a sense of responsibility.

312
00:28:47,881 --> 00:28:49,682
[SPEAKER_08]: That's okay, we'll beat the partisanship out of you.

313
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:50,303
[SPEAKER_26]: Andrew, you know I love you.

314
00:28:50,323 --> 00:28:52,445
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not like I'm crawling in my skin or anything.

315
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:53,305
[SPEAKER_26]: You know I love you.

316
00:28:54,386 --> 00:28:55,407
[SPEAKER_26]: In a heterosexual way.

317
00:28:55,947 --> 00:28:57,249
[SPEAKER_26]: In a heterosexual top-heavy way.

318
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:58,530
[SPEAKER_26]: Angel!

319
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:00,331
[SPEAKER_25]: Hey, as long as it's top-heavy.

320
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:01,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

321
00:29:03,113 --> 00:29:03,774
[SPEAKER_02]: You're weak in your day.

322
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:04,821
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop laughing!

323
00:29:05,762 --> 00:29:06,262
[SPEAKER_25]: Can't help it.

324
00:29:08,063 --> 00:29:09,504
[SPEAKER_10]: Stop laughing, this is a serious discussion.

325
00:29:10,764 --> 00:29:11,245
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, really?

326
00:29:11,845 --> 00:29:13,546
[SPEAKER_10]: You're the one holding nachos in your lap.

327
00:29:14,566 --> 00:29:15,067
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway.

328
00:29:15,607 --> 00:29:16,888
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think they needed to know that.

329
00:29:17,208 --> 00:29:19,229
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but, yeah, they were just there.

330
00:29:19,309 --> 00:29:19,609
[SPEAKER_10]: Whatever.

331
00:29:21,490 --> 00:29:26,292
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know, I just work and school, and I had finals this week, so, yay.

332
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,354
[SPEAKER_10]: Half of my school days are...

333
00:29:30,134 --> 00:29:31,094
[SPEAKER_10]: What does RECA stand for?

334
00:29:31,114 --> 00:29:33,795
[SPEAKER_10]: Residents of East Contra Costa County Anime

335
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,882
[SPEAKER_27]: I wanted to go!

336
00:30:00,322 --> 00:30:01,743
[SPEAKER_27]: I saw we.

337
00:30:01,943 --> 00:30:07,085
[SPEAKER_02]: If anybody that went to RekkaCon is listening, please don't tell me how fabulous the convention was because I'm quite bitter.

338
00:30:08,346 --> 00:30:08,786
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

339
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:09,266
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll get over it.

340
00:30:09,286 --> 00:30:10,287
[SPEAKER_25]: Wendell sends his love.

341
00:30:11,227 --> 00:30:12,708
[SPEAKER_10]: And Jahi and everyone else.

342
00:30:12,908 --> 00:30:17,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to play the Step Squad promo after the next break so I can hear them.

343
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:19,531
[SPEAKER_10]: Everyone was there.

344
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,051
[SPEAKER_10]: It was cool.

345
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,193
[SPEAKER_10]: I got chased by an agent.

346
00:30:23,333 --> 00:30:23,933
[SPEAKER_10]: That was weird.

347
00:30:25,979 --> 00:30:28,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought you said I got chased by an Asian.

348
00:30:28,462 --> 00:30:28,662
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

349
00:30:28,762 --> 00:30:30,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what?

350
00:30:30,404 --> 00:30:32,066
[SPEAKER_25]: We had an Agent Smith cosplayer.

351
00:30:32,586 --> 00:30:32,706
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh.

352
00:30:33,527 --> 00:30:37,431
[SPEAKER_25]: Let's just say he's been discouraging me from playing MXO lately.

353
00:30:38,593 --> 00:30:41,095
[SPEAKER_10]: My... You were playing Nestor.

354
00:30:43,137 --> 00:30:43,958
[SPEAKER_26]: I sense a dispute.

355
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:45,059
[SPEAKER_25]: Cream corn.

356
00:30:45,099 --> 00:30:47,101
[SPEAKER_25]: And every time I see a pedestrian, I'm...

357
00:30:47,961 --> 00:30:49,302
[SPEAKER_25]: Out of curiosity, how is MXO?

358
00:30:49,322 --> 00:30:51,564
[SPEAKER_25]: I saw Loki play it for like 15 minutes, but that was about it.

359
00:30:51,584 --> 00:30:52,985
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was your MMO update.

360
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:53,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, Angel.

361
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:21,075
[SPEAKER_10]: As I just taunted in front of the mic, that was funny.

362
00:31:21,315 --> 00:31:23,097
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, let's see.

363
00:31:23,297 --> 00:31:25,959
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Rekkon yesterday, CCL last night.

364
00:31:26,079 --> 00:31:27,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay for CCL or something.

365
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:29,561
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn those card systems.

366
00:31:29,641 --> 00:31:30,142
[SPEAKER_10]: Damn them.

367
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,243
[SPEAKER_10]: Those stupid cards wouldn't rate.

368
00:31:32,263 --> 00:31:33,304
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm going, what the hell?

369
00:31:34,365 --> 00:31:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I know.

370
00:31:34,945 --> 00:31:36,967
[SPEAKER_02]: What is up with arcades that use cards?

371
00:31:37,438 --> 00:31:41,500
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, cards with a little magnetic strip on the back so it makes it look like, you know, it's all important or something.

372
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:44,121
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the card for CCL is ugly, too.

373
00:31:44,641 --> 00:31:49,143
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go put the card up on the webcam, www.orangelonsradio.com.

374
00:31:49,203 --> 00:31:50,744
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not fugly, it's more fugly.

375
00:31:52,185 --> 00:31:53,645
[SPEAKER_25]: People are wondering what MXO is.

376
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,946
[SPEAKER_25]: The Matrix Online.

377
00:31:55,826 --> 00:31:56,086
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

378
00:31:57,927 --> 00:31:58,788
[SPEAKER_10]: Put the card on the cam.

379
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:04,612
[SPEAKER_10]: And other than that, not much except for coming to the show today.

380
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:07,573
[SPEAKER_10]: So, there's not that much in my life going on.

381
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:08,854
[SPEAKER_10]: Yet.

382
00:32:09,734 --> 00:32:10,174
[SPEAKER_10]: Or something.

383
00:32:10,234 --> 00:32:11,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Except for Spring Break starting tomorrow.

384
00:32:13,336 --> 00:32:14,436
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay, Spring Break!

385
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:14,977
[SPEAKER_10]: Woohoo!

386
00:32:16,637 --> 00:32:19,739
[SPEAKER_10]: Where I'm going to do nothing but play MMOs all week or something.

387
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:21,800
[SPEAKER_10]: What?

388
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,701
[SPEAKER_10]: You're not going to Nude Beach, you dumbass.

389
00:32:28,692 --> 00:32:29,052
[SPEAKER_10]: Really?

390
00:32:29,112 --> 00:32:29,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Screw the nude beach.

391
00:32:29,872 --> 00:32:32,293
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go to Curves because they all exercise topless there.

392
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:36,894
[SPEAKER_02]: At the nude beach?

393
00:32:36,974 --> 00:32:37,574
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.

394
00:32:41,716 --> 00:32:42,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

395
00:32:44,936 --> 00:32:45,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that it, Angel?

396
00:32:45,617 --> 00:32:45,817
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.

397
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:46,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

398
00:32:46,457 --> 00:32:46,717
[SPEAKER_10]: Sorry.

399
00:32:46,937 --> 00:32:47,297
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

400
00:32:47,417 --> 00:32:48,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Hand the mic off to Loki.

401
00:32:49,358 --> 00:32:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: Why, Loki, why do you have gummy bears stuck to your forehead?

402
00:32:52,298 --> 00:32:54,119
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't... What the hell?

403
00:32:54,459 --> 00:32:55,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bored.

404
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:55,659
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

405
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they stick.

406
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,420
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why.

407
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:04,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's because I touch myself at night.

408
00:33:06,745 --> 00:33:07,125
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

409
00:33:07,145 --> 00:33:09,707
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty stuck.

410
00:33:10,047 --> 00:33:11,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to eat it off?

411
00:33:12,489 --> 00:33:13,349
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that is gross!

412
00:33:13,589 --> 00:33:14,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god!

413
00:33:14,830 --> 00:33:17,072
[SPEAKER_02]: Such blatant heterosexuality in my home.

414
00:33:17,672 --> 00:33:27,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, just so you guys know, because this isn't TV, Loki's fiance just ate the gummy bear off of his forehead and totally licked his forehead in the process.

415
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:28,620
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know where that's been.

416
00:33:29,748 --> 00:33:31,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew, breeders.

417
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:35,333
[SPEAKER_06]: I put worse things in my mouth off his body.

418
00:33:36,494 --> 00:33:38,396
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we... Do we have a bleeper?

419
00:33:38,536 --> 00:33:40,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we have a dump button or a bleeper?

420
00:33:41,218 --> 00:33:42,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways... Oh wait, I forgot we're internet.

421
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:45,803
[SPEAKER_03]: No, so... What did I do this week?

422
00:33:46,604 --> 00:33:46,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

423
00:33:47,004 --> 00:33:49,026
[SPEAKER_03]: I interviewed for my games position.

424
00:33:49,086 --> 00:33:50,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I did really well.

425
00:33:50,387 --> 00:33:50,928
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?

426
00:33:52,349 --> 00:33:53,310
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, so...

427
00:33:55,015 --> 00:33:55,655
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not break it.

428
00:33:55,695 --> 00:33:57,476
[SPEAKER_03]: It was faulty craftsmanship.

429
00:33:57,496 --> 00:33:58,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not shop at Zale's.

430
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,121
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

431
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,857
[SPEAKER_03]: You just eat them and you want more and more and more.

432
00:34:39,117 --> 00:34:41,759
[SPEAKER_02]: Mall pretzels are the shit with like the mustard.

433
00:34:42,419 --> 00:34:45,902
[SPEAKER_03]: Mrs. Fields, pretzel time pretzels are the fucking bomb.

434
00:34:46,182 --> 00:34:49,785
[SPEAKER_03]: You eat them and you're just like, need more, more, crack, more.

435
00:34:50,005 --> 00:34:52,827
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get those huge soft like pretzels at Costco.

436
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're not the same.

437
00:34:54,648 --> 00:34:55,569
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the same at all.

438
00:34:55,589 --> 00:34:56,630
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but they're close.

439
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:57,190
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.

440
00:34:57,490 --> 00:35:00,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, I bought four one time and I ate them all.

441
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:05,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I got full, I waited until I became unful and I ate them at rest.

442
00:35:05,416 --> 00:35:05,696
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just,

443
00:35:06,218 --> 00:35:08,259
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like me and drumsticks.

444
00:35:08,499 --> 00:35:10,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the ice cream cones.

445
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,520
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

446
00:35:10,540 --> 00:35:11,841
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so good.

447
00:35:12,261 --> 00:35:13,602
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what else did we do this week?

448
00:35:14,603 --> 00:35:27,730
[SPEAKER_03]: We got the apartment stuff finalized so we're going to be moving into our place on the 16th of next month and then I know there's some other stuff I did.

449
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:30,672
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki and I will no longer be living together as of next month.

450
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:31,172
[SPEAKER_02]: Freedom!

451
00:35:31,692 --> 00:35:34,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll be living with Nellie.

452
00:35:36,316 --> 00:35:39,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, wait a minute, you're moving in together before you're married?

453
00:35:41,078 --> 00:35:43,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sinners living in sin!

454
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:44,940
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

455
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:49,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, anyways, so, um... How did you know the name of our apartment complex?

456
00:35:50,943 --> 00:35:54,405
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, we're at... My household will be all gay.

457
00:35:54,425 --> 00:35:56,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew!

458
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:58,287
We should move into, like, the same thing.

459
00:35:58,647 --> 00:36:00,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, sorry, we keep cutting Loki off.

460
00:36:01,948 --> 00:36:02,929
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um...

461
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:09,044
[SPEAKER_03]: So I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week, as usual, just because I can't.

462
00:36:09,424 --> 00:36:16,570
[SPEAKER_03]: I would be playing other games, but some person hasn't returned my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so I haven't been able to play that.

463
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:18,631
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got bored and I bought more games.

464
00:36:18,972 --> 00:36:26,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought Dog's Life and Gran Turismo 4, and I must say I can't drive for shit in Gran Turismo 4.

465
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:31,842
[SPEAKER_03]: The first thing you do, and I don't know why people do this, at least I did, is you drive your car.

466
00:36:32,282 --> 00:36:33,623
[SPEAKER_03]: You pick your car in the game.

467
00:36:34,392 --> 00:36:36,732
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I picked my Ford Focus, and guess what?

468
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:37,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It sucks!

469
00:36:38,653 --> 00:36:39,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a race car!

470
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:45,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I was playing the rally mode, where you basically... Well, as a reminder, you own a Ford.

471
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:46,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

472
00:36:47,115 --> 00:37:00,617
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so I was playing the rally mode, whatever, versus, like, they had some, like, really nice Subaru rally car, you know, versus the boat that I picked, and obviously the rally car beat my boat, and that pissed me off.

473
00:37:01,597 --> 00:37:04,058
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, so, anyways...

474
00:37:04,542 --> 00:37:08,083
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll talk more about those games on the podcast, which you can download every week.

475
00:37:08,924 --> 00:37:18,907
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I did that, and all I must say, a little teaser for the podcast, I've been throwing poop on cars.

476
00:37:21,368 --> 00:37:22,048
[SPEAKER_03]: Poop on cars.

477
00:37:22,088 --> 00:37:22,909
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not kidding.

478
00:37:23,469 --> 00:37:23,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Not kidding.

479
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,611
[SPEAKER_03]: As a dog, I've taken shits in places I've never known that I could take shits in.

480
00:37:31,092 --> 00:37:31,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And so...

481
00:37:32,492 --> 00:37:33,293
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a very fun game.

482
00:37:33,414 --> 00:37:34,495
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, seriously try it.

483
00:37:34,616 --> 00:37:35,918
[SPEAKER_03]: And Gran Turismo 4, beautiful.

484
00:37:37,681 --> 00:37:39,504
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo 4 is a sexy game.

485
00:37:39,904 --> 00:37:40,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very sexy.

486
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:43,911
[SPEAKER_03]: They have like this like, really like, operatic, you know, like,

487
00:37:44,770 --> 00:37:47,011
[SPEAKER_03]: Music in the beginning, and I'm like, what the hell?

488
00:37:47,952 --> 00:37:50,893
[SPEAKER_03]: But I missed the Cardigan song that was in Gran Turismo 2.

489
00:37:51,113 --> 00:37:54,334
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Crystal Method in this game, which is pretty cool.

490
00:37:54,735 --> 00:38:00,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen the soundtrack list yet, but they had some Crystal Method in there, and that was kind of neat.

491
00:38:01,398 --> 00:38:05,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And, I don't know, it's just fun stuff, playing a few sim files.

492
00:38:07,540 --> 00:38:11,162
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, my wrist was sore from playing Step Mania.

493
00:38:11,182 --> 00:38:11,462
[SPEAKER_18]: Meh.

494
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:12,303
[SPEAKER_03]: Meh.

495
00:38:12,863 --> 00:38:13,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Meh.

496
00:38:13,666 --> 00:38:15,246
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm getting better, okay?

497
00:38:16,387 --> 00:38:20,327
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, pretty soon... No, I've got masturbation down.

498
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about step mania.

499
00:38:22,808 --> 00:38:23,708
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not worried about that.

500
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:26,829
[SPEAKER_03]: You already AAA'd masturbation, sorry.

501
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:27,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

502
00:38:28,509 --> 00:38:31,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, by the way, I should mention this because it was quite funny.

503
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,510
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out... No, not masturbation.

504
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out last week my mom was listening to our show.

505
00:38:38,711 --> 00:38:41,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, maybe I should stop saying... And masturbating?

506
00:38:41,812 --> 00:38:43,312
[SPEAKER_02]: I should stop saying things like that.

507
00:38:46,581 --> 00:38:57,751
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if Matthew's mom is listening, Matthew has never masturbated in his life, and he's never looked at a girl with impure thoughts, and he gets straight A's in school.

508
00:38:58,792 --> 00:38:59,452
[SPEAKER_02]: How good is school?

509
00:39:00,994 --> 00:39:03,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember that one time she walked in on you?

510
00:39:03,876 --> 00:39:04,937
[SPEAKER_17]: She's gonna... Oh my god!

511
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,161
[SPEAKER_18]: You're gonna have to fight

512
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why Nelly doesn't get a microphone on this show.

513
00:39:15,204 --> 00:39:18,665
[SPEAKER_02]: I still think the mic picked that up, but... I think it did.

514
00:39:20,305 --> 00:39:21,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Judging by the reaction.

515
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:32,528
[SPEAKER_02]: I am at a loss for words.

516
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I just... I don't know what to say.

517
00:39:35,408 --> 00:39:35,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Not anymore.

518
00:39:36,188 --> 00:39:39,049
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs my sister to help her, you know, with finding stuff.

519
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:43,882
[SPEAKER_03]: She's not in the chat room.

520
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,483
[SPEAKER_02]: She wouldn't even know how to get in the chat room.

521
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:47,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, MPQ's got a point.

522
00:39:47,044 --> 00:39:49,105
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you don't tell your parents what you do on the internet.

523
00:39:49,165 --> 00:39:50,246
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what?

524
00:39:50,526 --> 00:39:51,467
[SPEAKER_02]: Parents find out.

525
00:39:52,107 --> 00:39:55,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like they find out about masturbation, they find out about your radio show on the internet.

526
00:39:55,890 --> 00:39:57,411
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a freaking adult, okay?

527
00:39:57,471 --> 00:39:58,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.

528
00:39:58,812 --> 00:39:59,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

529
00:40:00,113 --> 00:40:00,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

530
00:40:03,195 --> 00:40:04,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'm done.

531
00:40:04,135 --> 00:40:04,676
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I did.

532
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:05,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

533
00:40:06,417 --> 00:40:08,078
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie, you want to share anything about your week and your day?

534
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:09,319
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

535
00:40:09,339 --> 00:40:09,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

536
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

537
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:16,012
[SPEAKER_02]: Before we get a break, we are going to go to a break pretty soon here, but I want to bring up some news.

538
00:40:16,872 --> 00:40:18,113
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to talk about Bomani news.

539
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:19,073
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to that after the break.

540
00:40:19,453 --> 00:40:38,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to talk about this, because I know a lot of Bomani nerds are into this series as well, and this is definitely worth mentioning, but it's been a little mentioned in Nintendo Power, a little tiny, little slip in Namco's upcoming calendar says that Katamari Damacy DS is on the way.

541
00:40:40,122 --> 00:40:40,442
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

542
00:40:40,982 --> 00:40:42,623
[SPEAKER_02]: Something for you guys to think about there.

543
00:40:42,643 --> 00:40:45,426
[SPEAKER_02]: And my question is, how in the hell are you going to control that?

544
00:40:45,546 --> 00:40:46,466
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be weird.

545
00:40:46,586 --> 00:40:47,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Stylus, hello.

546
00:40:47,707 --> 00:40:51,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to be that faux analog thing like Mario 64 has?

547
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:52,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, here's how it's going to work.

548
00:40:53,452 --> 00:40:54,172
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite simple.

549
00:40:54,593 --> 00:41:01,358
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have, you know, not faux analog, but you're going to have the directional button and you have your four buttons.

550
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:03,820
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are your two sticks right there.

551
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,242
[SPEAKER_03]: Either that or you can use the stylus to roll it.

552
00:41:07,303 --> 00:41:09,064
[SPEAKER_03]: You just kind of move the stylus.

553
00:41:11,087 --> 00:41:14,748
[SPEAKER_02]: You could just keep rolling it forward to the side using the stylus.

554
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:15,508
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that would work.

555
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:20,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice that the DS is going to get a game.

556
00:41:21,010 --> 00:41:24,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We keep hearing about all this cool stuff that's going to come out on the DS.

557
00:41:25,231 --> 00:41:37,334
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday when I was at GameStop looking at games, I looked at the wall of all the stuff that's supposed to be launching with the PSP, and then I walked over to the DS section, and it was literally half a shelf.

558
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:38,765
[SPEAKER_03]: Not even a shelf.

559
00:41:38,845 --> 00:41:40,046
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a small shelf.

560
00:41:40,426 --> 00:41:42,488
[SPEAKER_03]: They had maybe ten games.

561
00:41:42,948 --> 00:41:43,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

562
00:41:43,468 --> 00:41:44,729
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was everything that's out right now.

563
00:41:44,749 --> 00:41:46,851
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, God, the DS sucks.

564
00:41:47,732 --> 00:41:51,315
[SPEAKER_27]: But the thing is, is that the DS as a system, it doesn't suck.

565
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:53,636
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Well, they released some games then.

566
00:41:53,656 --> 00:41:55,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, because they're bastard people.

567
00:41:55,998 --> 00:41:57,560
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no other explanation for that.

568
00:41:57,760 --> 00:41:58,140
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

569
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Other systems did the exact same thing, and it failed horribly.

570
00:42:01,463 --> 00:42:03,284
[SPEAKER_03]: Please don't say Engage, or I'll hate you forever.

571
00:42:05,911 --> 00:42:07,992
[SPEAKER_03]: No, those both sucked from launch.

572
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:11,453
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm talking about Nintendo 64.

573
00:42:11,673 --> 00:42:13,014
[SPEAKER_03]: That failed as a system.

574
00:42:13,634 --> 00:42:15,815
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because there wasn't that many games out for it.

575
00:42:16,015 --> 00:42:18,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Atari Lynx.

576
00:42:18,756 --> 00:42:21,858
[SPEAKER_02]: But it did have Pokemon Snap.

577
00:42:22,598 --> 00:42:24,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Pokemon Dash out right now.

578
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:29,601
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing about the DS is that it does have a lot of good games coming soon.

579
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:31,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Animal Crossing DS, coming soon.

580
00:42:31,783 --> 00:42:32,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, September.

581
00:42:32,904 --> 00:42:33,784
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo, fun.

582
00:42:34,244 --> 00:42:35,966
[SPEAKER_03]: That's assuming they don't push it back.

583
00:42:36,246 --> 00:42:36,986
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

584
00:42:38,787 --> 00:42:41,169
[SPEAKER_25]: See, the problem with DS, though, is it's a new technology.

585
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:44,711
[SPEAKER_25]: Not everyone knows how to market for dual screens.

586
00:42:45,632 --> 00:42:47,353
[SPEAKER_25]: Not everyone is willing to take the plunge.

587
00:42:48,213 --> 00:42:50,915
[SPEAKER_25]: I mean, PSP, everyone knows how to do one screen.

588
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:52,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

589
00:42:52,656 --> 00:42:54,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Castlevania DS will make it all better.

590
00:42:54,277 --> 00:42:57,199
[SPEAKER_25]: Castlevania DS will be my god when it's out.

591
00:42:57,359 --> 00:42:57,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

592
00:42:58,570 --> 00:43:00,611
[SPEAKER_27]: Speaking of PSP, is anybody planning on picking one up?

593
00:43:01,511 --> 00:43:02,612
[SPEAKER_09]: I already have ours reserved.

594
00:43:03,452 --> 00:43:06,193
[SPEAKER_27]: Do you guys have a demo in the house because of what your man does?

595
00:43:06,373 --> 00:43:07,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody's got one at the store.

596
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:08,654
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh, right on.

597
00:43:09,015 --> 00:43:10,075
[SPEAKER_27]: Has he given you any feedback on it?

598
00:43:10,615 --> 00:43:11,376
[SPEAKER_08]: He said it was fun.

599
00:43:11,976 --> 00:43:12,896
[SPEAKER_27]: Have you gotten to play it at all yet?

600
00:43:12,916 --> 00:43:16,118
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't really been all that excited about playing it.

601
00:43:16,798 --> 00:43:24,762
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a PSP, but I don't want it right now because I just have too much other shit going on, which sucks because I wish somebody would just send me a free one.

602
00:43:24,782 --> 00:43:25,642
[SPEAKER_08]: I need Wipeout Pure.

603
00:43:26,874 --> 00:43:28,455
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of... Oh, see, I want Lumines.

604
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:31,997
[SPEAKER_25]: I would buy it for Metal Gear Acid.

605
00:43:32,937 --> 00:43:35,499
[SPEAKER_02]: See, all these cool games coming out, like, right around launch period.

606
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,301
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the DS, like... What did we get at launch?

607
00:43:39,341 --> 00:43:41,742
[SPEAKER_02]: We got Mario, which was cool, but it was a rehashed game.

608
00:43:42,482 --> 00:43:43,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Spider-Man 2.

609
00:43:44,303 --> 00:43:45,084
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoop-de-doo!

610
00:43:45,224 --> 00:43:46,044
[SPEAKER_02]: Feel the magic.

611
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:47,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Fun for about five minutes.

612
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:48,185
[SPEAKER_25]: Fun, fun, fun, fun.

613
00:43:48,306 --> 00:43:48,866
[SPEAKER_02]: For about five minutes.

614
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:49,546
[SPEAKER_25]: Mr. Driller DS.

615
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:52,408
[SPEAKER_25]: And eventually we're getting some fun stuff.

616
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:53,168
[SPEAKER_02]: But Mr. Driller's been done.

617
00:43:53,188 --> 00:43:54,249
[SPEAKER_25]: WarioWare Twisted.

618
00:43:54,909 --> 00:43:55,569
[SPEAKER_25]: Sorry, Touched.

619
00:43:55,770 --> 00:43:56,510
[SPEAKER_02]: Touched is already out.

620
00:43:57,268 --> 00:43:58,611
[SPEAKER_25]: We've finally gotten to that.

621
00:44:01,055 --> 00:44:03,819
[SPEAKER_25]: Castlevania DS will be out soon, supposedly.

622
00:44:03,839 --> 00:44:04,080
[SPEAKER_25]: Mario Kart

623
00:44:09,275 --> 00:44:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a long-term gamer and the battery life thing is still kind of... No.

624
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:36,562
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to take a break.

625
00:44:36,902 --> 00:44:39,944
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, I promised DarkSakura we'd do some forest style music.

626
00:44:39,964 --> 00:44:41,805
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what we're going to do.

627
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,246
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start off with Empathy.

628
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:45,167
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that song is rad.

629
00:44:46,508 --> 00:44:50,330
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and some news on night style.

630
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:53,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that kind of involves indirectly some news from forest style.

631
00:44:53,212 --> 00:44:55,694
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio.

632
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:02,836
Thanks for watching!

633
00:49:01,463 --> 00:49:01,957
Thank you.

634
00:52:23,317 --> 00:52:26,578
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

635
00:52:26,638 --> 00:52:26,858
[SPEAKER_15]: Wee!

636
00:52:44,704 --> 00:52:46,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Taku, Empathy, LED, Infinite Prayer, The Floating Flocks

637
00:52:57,383 --> 00:53:02,666
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Taka featuring Jasmine, Final Countdown, and Ryu with StarMine.

638
00:53:02,706 --> 00:53:15,073
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ryu, one of those interesting guys because he had that song in 4th style and then disappeared for a long ass time and then came back and I don't remember if it was 9th or 10th, but he disappeared for a while and then just recently came back to the series.

639
00:53:15,173 --> 00:53:17,314
[SPEAKER_02]: So, hope you enjoyed that stuff from 4th style.

640
00:53:17,754 --> 00:53:22,977
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, 2DX 9th style is on people's minds right now because...

641
00:53:23,891 --> 00:53:25,031
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

642
00:53:46,815 --> 00:53:49,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully some of you guys out there may already have been seeing it.

643
00:53:50,196 --> 00:53:51,797
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't, though, you're going to be getting that very soon.

644
00:53:51,977 --> 00:53:56,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I need to get my copy still, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm poor.

645
00:53:57,079 --> 00:53:58,519
[SPEAKER_02]: So I won't be getting it for a little while.

646
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,960
[SPEAKER_02]: But hopefully soon.

647
00:54:01,161 --> 00:54:05,322
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I know you usually pick up a lot of the new 2DX styles as they come out.

648
00:54:05,342 --> 00:54:06,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you getting this one?

649
00:54:06,963 --> 00:54:08,223
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I just didn't pre-order it.

650
00:54:08,823 --> 00:54:12,885
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you're not huge on 9th style, so I don't know if you maybe passed on it or what.

651
00:54:13,105 --> 00:54:15,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly didn't care about 9th style, but I'm going to get it.

652
00:54:17,776 --> 00:54:19,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be a perfectionist, right?

653
00:54:19,137 --> 00:54:20,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a completionist, I should say.

654
00:54:20,318 --> 00:54:21,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, but I'm still missing Forthstyle.

655
00:54:22,439 --> 00:54:23,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess that's true.

656
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,520
[SPEAKER_02]: But Forthstyle's a little harder to find.

657
00:54:25,821 --> 00:54:26,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Not really.

658
00:54:26,281 --> 00:54:26,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

659
00:54:26,521 --> 00:54:27,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was.

660
00:54:27,562 --> 00:54:28,082
[SPEAKER_08]: I can find it.

661
00:54:28,283 --> 00:54:28,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, rad.

662
00:54:28,623 --> 00:54:29,843
[SPEAKER_08]: I just haven't spent the money on it.

663
00:54:30,304 --> 00:54:34,987
[SPEAKER_08]: But Forthstyle's going to be on the back burner because I have to get Vibriple.

664
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:36,187
[SPEAKER_27]: Oh.

665
00:54:37,188 --> 00:54:37,488
[SPEAKER_27]: Cool.

666
00:54:37,728 --> 00:54:40,230
[SPEAKER_08]: And I still need to find Mojibribbon, but that one's been kind of out.

667
00:54:43,482 --> 00:54:46,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, four style songs that are coming back into Night Style.

668
00:54:46,805 --> 00:54:48,367
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of repeats.

669
00:54:48,407 --> 00:54:57,715
[SPEAKER_02]: If you check out the official Night Style Consumer Version website, konamistudio.co.jp slash bm2, the number two, dx2.

670
00:54:58,835 --> 00:55:07,919
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has a whole big song list.

671
00:55:08,259 --> 00:55:09,960
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of the songs coming back from 4Style.

672
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:10,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Just some of them.

673
00:55:10,620 --> 00:55:11,320
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones I recognize.

674
00:55:11,421 --> 00:55:12,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Empathy, of course.

675
00:55:12,521 --> 00:55:14,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Kamikaze is coming back.

676
00:55:15,782 --> 00:55:17,763
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is interesting, I think, from 3Style.

677
00:55:17,863 --> 00:55:19,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Dong Teppo, number one.

678
00:55:19,364 --> 00:55:19,964
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that one?

679
00:55:20,704 --> 00:55:21,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate that song.

680
00:55:21,325 --> 00:55:22,385
[SPEAKER_02]: That song was hilarious.

681
00:55:23,105 --> 00:55:27,167
[SPEAKER_02]: And Macho Gang by Anal Spider is coming back.

682
00:55:27,765 --> 00:55:28,726
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

683
00:55:29,546 --> 00:55:30,526
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, no, no, no, no.

684
00:55:31,067 --> 00:55:32,948
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Hamburger Helper video that goes along with that.

685
00:55:33,768 --> 00:55:37,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Some very interesting consumer tracks making their way into the Night Style Home version.

686
00:55:38,010 --> 00:55:41,592
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple LED tracks, including Jaeger Final Attack.

687
00:55:42,421 --> 00:55:44,541
[SPEAKER_02]: and another song called Photoingenic.

688
00:55:45,101 --> 00:55:51,523
[SPEAKER_02]: And then LED usually teams up with Groovy, but actually Groovy has their own song featuring No Plus Chin.

689
00:55:52,423 --> 00:55:56,883
[SPEAKER_02]: 5PM Eternal is a song that they have in the Night Style.

690
00:55:56,923 --> 00:55:58,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, for the full list, you can head on over there.

691
00:55:59,004 --> 00:56:02,344
[SPEAKER_02]: All the brand new Night Style songs are making their way to the home version.

692
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,305
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe they stopped doing the license thing with Night Style.

693
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:07,985
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I haven't noticed anything missing.

694
00:56:08,505 --> 00:56:10,486
[SPEAKER_02]: If there was something missing, then I just didn't notice it.

695
00:56:11,346 --> 00:56:11,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

696
00:56:12,206 --> 00:56:14,788
[SPEAKER_02]: My only concern is that Bad Boy Bass made it in.

697
00:56:17,809 --> 00:56:21,632
[SPEAKER_02]: And Bad Boy Bass did make it in, so that was my only concern, because it's my favorite Nightstyle song.

698
00:56:22,792 --> 00:56:32,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, I'm sure Lionski, for those of you guys that are into Kiriyamaoka, and who can blame you, I'm sure that song also is making its debut, along with the video in Nightstyle.

699
00:56:32,378 --> 00:56:35,640
[SPEAKER_02]: So, good times there for 2DX Nightstyle.

700
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, I know you're really into 2DX as well.

701
00:56:37,601 --> 00:56:39,342
[SPEAKER_02]: What are your thoughts on the Nightstyle release this week?

702
00:56:40,808 --> 00:56:42,429
[SPEAKER_10]: I want it, but I need to get 8th first.

703
00:56:43,770 --> 00:56:44,771
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm a little behind.

704
00:56:44,951 --> 00:56:46,932
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm a lot... Well, I'm not that behind.

705
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:50,615
[SPEAKER_10]: I just need 8th and 9th now, so... You know.

706
00:56:51,956 --> 00:56:53,156
[SPEAKER_10]: Plus I need to practice more, too.

707
00:56:55,678 --> 00:56:57,119
[SPEAKER_02]: Practice makes perfect.

708
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki, I know you hate 2DX, but any interest in this whatsoever?

709
00:57:03,864 --> 00:57:04,624
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, mic's not on, bud.

710
00:57:04,644 --> 00:57:07,266
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't hate 2DX, but, uh...

711
00:57:11,002 --> 00:57:13,043
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone's breaking the mic!

712
00:57:13,183 --> 00:57:13,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds fine.

713
00:57:14,744 --> 00:57:16,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that, but there's pieces of metal jetting out.

714
00:57:17,206 --> 00:57:17,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yuck.

715
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:20,108
[SPEAKER_03]: And the top part's coming off.

716
00:57:20,468 --> 00:57:20,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-oh.

717
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:22,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

718
00:57:22,689 --> 00:57:22,949
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway.

719
00:57:24,891 --> 00:57:25,371
[SPEAKER_03]: My thoughts.

720
00:57:27,032 --> 00:57:27,752
[SPEAKER_03]: It's another game.

721
00:57:28,032 --> 00:57:28,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

722
00:57:31,495 --> 00:57:31,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

723
00:57:33,296 --> 00:57:33,696
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray.

724
00:57:33,876 --> 00:57:35,017
[SPEAKER_03]: Another 2DX game.

725
00:57:35,517 --> 00:57:37,438
[SPEAKER_03]: How have they made it any better?

726
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:38,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope, they haven't.

727
00:57:40,396 --> 00:57:41,857
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to know about the timing.

728
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get some feedback on how the timing is.

729
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:47,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I haven't had the time today to read the message boards.

730
00:57:47,382 --> 00:57:53,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that when we open up the Skype line later, maybe some folks might already know about if the timing got better from the arcade.

731
00:57:54,168 --> 00:58:04,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to say we did have somebody was saying, I think it was Siggy or somebody on the Skype line a couple weeks back was saying that the timing is somewhat better, which I hope is true.

732
00:58:05,959 --> 00:58:06,239
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway...

733
00:58:08,652 --> 00:58:09,873
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for Night Style.

734
00:58:09,913 --> 00:58:11,594
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't have a whole lot else to add to that.

735
00:58:11,995 --> 00:58:16,338
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anybody else have any exciting Night Style related news?

736
00:58:17,139 --> 00:58:19,741
[SPEAKER_08]: I kind of want the Deluxe set.

737
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:21,002
[SPEAKER_27]: What is coming in?

738
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:22,283
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't even remember what's coming in.

739
00:58:22,303 --> 00:58:27,547
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got a DVD, the VRare 10, and a sticker book.

740
00:58:28,348 --> 00:58:28,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

741
00:58:30,630 --> 00:58:33,092
[SPEAKER_08]: When I saw sticker book, I was like, I don't want stickers.

742
00:58:34,272 --> 00:58:37,315
[SPEAKER_08]: I almost bought the Papa Music 9, the Deluxe set.

743
00:58:38,405 --> 00:58:39,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, that was pretty cool.

744
00:58:39,326 --> 00:58:40,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I wanted a teacup.

745
00:58:41,728 --> 00:58:44,410
[SPEAKER_08]: But I ended up buying right-hands instead.

746
00:58:44,850 --> 00:58:51,876
[SPEAKER_02]: You know another song that shows up in Night Style Consumer is Number 13 by Taco with Respect for JSB.

747
00:58:52,537 --> 00:58:56,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And that would be one of them preview tracks from a future 2DX style.

748
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:57,421
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

749
00:58:57,461 --> 00:59:00,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of glad that that is showing up.

750
00:59:00,443 --> 00:59:01,344
[SPEAKER_02]: I like seeing preview songs.

751
00:59:01,364 --> 00:59:05,127
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just glad we're getting more 2DX, but now they need to start bringing out the Guitadora.

752
00:59:05,538 --> 00:59:07,900
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird that they've all been coming out like back to back.

753
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:12,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we went years with no 2DX at home and then suddenly, bam, 7th, 8th, now 9th.

754
00:59:12,484 --> 00:59:13,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, we fucked up.

755
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:23,394
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know that if this does well, which I assume it will because it's got a pretty big following here in the States, 10th will be out probably by the end of summer, which is rock.

756
00:59:24,215 --> 00:59:25,496
[SPEAKER_02]: Because 10th style is pretty cool too.

757
00:59:25,516 --> 00:59:27,198
[SPEAKER_08]: I have to have my Gradius.

758
00:59:27,566 --> 00:59:32,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Remember back in the day when they're like, We don't make you seven style unless you vote!

759
00:59:33,149 --> 00:59:34,070
[SPEAKER_17]: And if you buy!

760
00:59:35,031 --> 00:59:36,331
[SPEAKER_17]: Or else we don't make!

761
00:59:36,612 --> 00:59:40,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I remember that, that they were saying, And now they're like, Oh, you like!

762
00:59:40,374 --> 00:59:41,354
[SPEAKER_03]: You buy the game!

763
00:59:41,374 --> 00:59:42,955
[SPEAKER_03]: We make more for you!

764
00:59:44,876 --> 00:59:46,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, thank you for that.

765
00:59:46,197 --> 00:59:49,739
[SPEAKER_02]: You can address those cards and letters to matt at orangelawnsradio.com, by the way.

766
00:59:53,742 --> 00:59:53,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

767
00:59:55,652 --> 01:00:00,514
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I just, I kind of hope that they're still going to come out in the arcade as well, like 2DX Red.

768
01:00:00,534 --> 01:00:05,596
[SPEAKER_02]: I still haven't gotten a chance to play Red, but I'm kind of hoping to when I get to go down to L.A.

769
01:00:05,696 --> 01:00:06,296
[SPEAKER_02]: in a couple weeks.

770
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:07,496
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

771
01:00:07,997 --> 01:00:12,958
[SPEAKER_02]: And then hopefully that'll be out for home by early next year, so at the rate things are going, that'll be pretty cool.

772
01:00:14,099 --> 01:00:18,320
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, do you think there's any room for 2DX to evolve in the near future?

773
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:21,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Or beat, I guess I should say, maybe not necessarily 2DX, but Beatmania?

774
01:00:22,922 --> 01:00:24,903
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though Beatmania, the 5D version...

775
01:00:26,977 --> 01:00:27,677
[SPEAKER_02]: Been there, done that.

776
01:00:27,717 --> 01:00:28,658
[SPEAKER_02]: Keyboard Mania doubles.

777
01:00:28,718 --> 01:00:29,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

778
01:00:32,798 --> 01:00:34,399
[SPEAKER_08]: They can come with an ice cream dispenser.

779
01:00:34,439 --> 01:00:36,339
[SPEAKER_03]: Typing of the beat.

780
01:00:37,299 --> 01:00:38,080
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they did that.

781
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:38,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember that?

782
01:00:38,640 --> 01:00:39,740
[SPEAKER_08]: Beat Mania, da, da, da.

783
01:00:40,100 --> 01:00:41,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

784
01:00:41,720 --> 01:00:42,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Da, da, da.

785
01:00:43,201 --> 01:00:43,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

786
01:00:43,621 --> 01:00:44,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

787
01:00:44,821 --> 01:00:46,481
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard it was total crap, too.

788
01:00:47,282 --> 01:00:49,522
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that Lupin typing game.

789
01:00:50,456 --> 01:00:50,996
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to play that.

790
01:00:51,016 --> 01:00:52,276
[SPEAKER_08]: I have Typing of the Dead at home.

791
01:00:52,497 --> 01:00:57,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sad that there was not any more keyboard manias that came out.

792
01:00:57,898 --> 01:00:58,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of 50-key.

793
01:00:59,998 --> 01:01:00,919
[SPEAKER_08]: I like keyboard manias.

794
01:01:00,979 --> 01:01:02,479
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever happened to the para-para?

795
01:01:02,619 --> 01:01:04,179
[SPEAKER_02]: Or dance maniacs, for that matter.

796
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:06,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the pata-pata craze has died down in Japan.

797
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,001
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard rumors that Velfire just ain't what it used to be.

798
01:01:11,721 --> 01:01:18,383
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Velfire was a club, just a regular club anyway, that as far as I'm aware just did pata-pata on certain nights.

799
01:01:19,063 --> 01:01:19,283
[SPEAKER_26]: Right.

800
01:01:22,254 --> 01:01:23,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything to add to that.

801
01:01:23,194 --> 01:01:23,875
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm still going to go there.

802
01:01:24,335 --> 01:01:24,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish that.

803
01:01:25,196 --> 01:01:30,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be hilarious that if, like, in San Francisco or something, there was actually a bar where they did that as well.

804
01:01:30,659 --> 01:01:31,540
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think that would be hilarious.

805
01:01:31,840 --> 01:01:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if people can fucking country line dance, why can't they para para?

806
01:01:34,902 --> 01:01:35,342
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously?

807
01:01:36,003 --> 01:01:37,724
[SPEAKER_02]: You look just as stupid doing either one.

808
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:39,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's just me.

809
01:01:39,966 --> 01:01:41,247
[SPEAKER_08]: Para para, though, is kind of cool.

810
01:01:41,267 --> 01:01:42,207
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like cheerleading, though.

811
01:01:43,928 --> 01:01:44,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of.

812
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,351
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all happy.

813
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:49,192
[SPEAKER_08]: And not boot scootin'.

814
01:01:50,177 --> 01:01:57,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I go to karaoke and some lesbian will get up there and start singing a country song like, you know, Don't Break My Heart, Mike.

815
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:58,221
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

816
01:01:58,261 --> 01:01:58,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody sings that.

817
01:01:58,821 --> 01:02:00,102
[SPEAKER_02]: But like, they'll sing Dixie Chicks or something.

818
01:02:00,482 --> 01:02:03,463
[SPEAKER_02]: And people start country line dancing and I'm like, that's so weird.

819
01:02:05,364 --> 01:02:05,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why.

820
01:02:05,944 --> 01:02:07,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't hate, but it's weird.

821
01:02:07,245 --> 01:02:08,145
[SPEAKER_17]: There's the straights!

822
01:02:08,245 --> 01:02:08,626
[SPEAKER_17]: Get them!

823
01:02:13,508 --> 01:02:14,608
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes perfect sense.

824
01:02:15,309 --> 01:02:16,709
[SPEAKER_03]: Gay people don't line dance.

825
01:02:16,849 --> 01:02:18,310
[SPEAKER_03]: It's documented in books.

826
01:02:22,222 --> 01:02:28,508
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

827
01:02:46,141 --> 01:02:46,541
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

828
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:47,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that's surprising.

829
01:02:48,043 --> 01:02:52,146
[SPEAKER_02]: I would think that square dancing would be like a whole class in Alabama that you take for units.

830
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:55,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Just teasing.

831
01:02:55,728 --> 01:02:55,989
[SPEAKER_05]: I know.

832
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:57,510
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what you can do with that finger.

833
01:02:59,431 --> 01:03:00,312
[SPEAKER_05]: I have plenty of ideas.

834
01:03:00,912 --> 01:03:01,913
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure a sheep?

835
01:03:05,756 --> 01:03:07,618
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit him, please.

836
01:03:08,438 --> 01:03:09,059
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I can't.

837
01:03:12,381 --> 01:03:13,302
[SPEAKER_02]: That's solid metal.

838
01:03:16,339 --> 01:03:16,900
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's hot.

839
01:03:46,187 --> 01:03:47,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Summer 2005, quote-unquote.

840
01:03:49,228 --> 01:03:52,889
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a pre-order bonus that you can get.

841
01:03:55,350 --> 01:04:03,093
[SPEAKER_02]: An In The Groove soundtrack, an In The Groove t-shirt, a Red Octane temporary tattoo, so you can be cool.

842
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, lame!

843
01:04:04,994 --> 01:04:09,995
[SPEAKER_02]: Put on that Red Octane tattoo and go to the Harley Davidson bar and show how cool you are.

844
01:04:10,676 --> 01:04:12,556
[SPEAKER_02]: A Red Octane keychain.

845
01:04:12,576 --> 01:04:13,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh!

846
01:04:14,710 --> 01:04:22,493
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is like crap that they made that they tried to give away at conventions, and it couldn't go anywhere, and they're like, what are we going to do with all this crap?

847
01:04:22,733 --> 01:04:24,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, let's give it away!

848
01:04:24,173 --> 01:04:24,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

849
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And free shipping.

850
01:04:28,135 --> 01:04:34,637
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as expected, there will be an In the Groove bundle, which will be the game, and an ignition pad.

851
01:04:34,657 --> 01:04:36,078
[SPEAKER_03]: Will it be as glitchy as the arcade?

852
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:38,338
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

853
01:04:38,358 --> 01:04:39,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that one of the features?

854
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:40,139
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.

855
01:04:41,573 --> 01:04:44,536
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I figured out about In The Groove for the first time when I was playing yesterday?

856
01:04:45,597 --> 01:04:55,125
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually sit and you watch the attract mode, it actually shows pictures of all the people who made the game, and then like pictures of all these people gathered up at the arcade.

857
01:04:56,341 --> 01:04:59,263
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw eight on the break in there, and I was like, oh, I played that machine.

858
01:04:59,303 --> 01:04:59,883
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

859
01:05:00,063 --> 01:05:07,267
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of neat in a way, but at the same time, I was kind of like, wow, these guys credit themselves as step chart makers.

860
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:10,589
[SPEAKER_02]: They credit themselves in the credits of the game.

861
01:05:11,069 --> 01:05:13,590
[SPEAKER_02]: They credit themselves in the opening sequence of the game.

862
01:05:14,731 --> 01:05:19,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that you shouldn't get a little credit, because these games take a lot of work, but

863
01:05:21,201 --> 01:05:29,970
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it seems like most other games I've played have a little bit of a hold warm when it comes to that stuff.

864
01:05:30,110 --> 01:05:31,671
[SPEAKER_02]: A little less, not so much.

865
01:05:33,373 --> 01:05:35,335
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

866
01:05:35,435 --> 01:05:37,077
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to get the hate mail.

867
01:05:37,437 --> 01:05:38,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not dogging on in the group.

868
01:05:38,819 --> 01:05:41,081
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually starting to warm up to the game a little bit.

869
01:05:41,161 --> 01:05:44,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm finding the five songs I really like to play over and over again.

870
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:45,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

871
01:05:45,949 --> 01:05:47,151
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having a good time.

872
01:05:47,211 --> 01:05:48,392
[SPEAKER_02]: And my scores are getting better.

873
01:05:48,733 --> 01:05:50,855
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting used to that wacky scrolling thing.

874
01:05:51,416 --> 01:05:52,497
[SPEAKER_02]: The way it scrolls initially.

875
01:05:52,918 --> 01:05:54,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, you had to play in the group for the first time this week.

876
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,261
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think?

877
01:05:56,405 --> 01:05:56,945
[SPEAKER_10]: I suck.

878
01:05:58,365 --> 01:05:59,286
[SPEAKER_10]: I suck bad.

879
01:05:59,786 --> 01:06:00,126
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

880
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:10,427
[SPEAKER_10]: I find the arrows, like, really small for, you know, the way, because I can't see that well, and just, you know, having small arrows kind of makes it hard.

881
01:06:10,928 --> 01:06:13,448
[SPEAKER_10]: So I had to follow by color, which doesn't exactly work.

882
01:06:14,208 --> 01:06:22,510
[SPEAKER_10]: But I figure with practice I will try to get better at the game, assuming we get to go again.

883
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,590
[SPEAKER_10]: So, other than that,

884
01:06:25,720 --> 01:06:28,821
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know any of the music or anything, so that didn't help.

885
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:30,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Rob was like, pick a song, pick a song.

886
01:06:30,462 --> 01:06:32,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, I don't know what I want to play, just pick one.

887
01:06:34,843 --> 01:06:40,865
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess as I play the game, I'll get to know the songs and I'll feel a little bit more comfortable with it.

888
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:44,066
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than that, yeah, it's okay.

889
01:06:45,167 --> 01:06:49,308
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still a rip-off, but it's still okay.

890
01:06:49,428 --> 01:06:51,069
[SPEAKER_02]: Andrew, you got to play it for the first time as well.

891
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:52,269
[SPEAKER_02]: What were your thoughts on IndieGroove?

892
01:06:53,322 --> 01:06:54,723
[SPEAKER_25]: That was pretty well done.

893
01:06:54,743 --> 01:07:02,450
[SPEAKER_25]: It did seem a little bit glitchy, but actually it plays like a finished product.

894
01:07:02,510 --> 01:07:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, glitchy is a very vague word.

895
01:07:04,892 --> 01:07:05,932
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean with glitchy?

896
01:07:07,574 --> 01:07:13,719
[SPEAKER_25]: Just some basic timing stuff, because I was listening to the songs and some steps just didn't match.

897
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:16,942
[SPEAKER_25]: So it mostly could be just a step chart problem.

898
01:07:16,962 --> 01:07:18,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that's a step chart glitch.

899
01:07:19,023 --> 01:07:22,266
[SPEAKER_25]: Could be just step charts to me, but it actually plays like a finished product.

900
01:07:25,950 --> 01:07:26,030
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.R.

901
01:07:50,807 --> 01:07:55,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Just patron of an arcade, a teenager, they're all the same.

902
01:07:55,289 --> 01:08:02,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm not giving the average user of the arcade enough credit, but I always thought every dance game was the same to most people that aren't in this scene.

903
01:08:05,392 --> 01:08:08,733
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's what I've always said, one leg up that DDR has on In the Groove.

904
01:08:09,073 --> 01:08:10,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Does In the Groove have more challenging steps?

905
01:08:10,814 --> 01:08:11,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

906
01:08:11,054 --> 01:08:11,514
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have a

907
01:08:12,395 --> 01:08:14,436
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR is all sweetness and light and candy!

908
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:39,313
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know, I think that attracts people to it more.

909
01:08:40,814 --> 01:08:41,954
[SPEAKER_02]: In a completely superficial way.

910
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:44,815
[SPEAKER_09]: It brings people out of the dark shadows that are with their lives.

911
01:08:45,215 --> 01:08:47,076
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing is, it looked very plain.

912
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:49,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Very plain.

913
01:08:49,877 --> 01:08:51,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, just even the arrows are plain.

914
01:08:51,938 --> 01:08:53,199
[SPEAKER_03]: The interface is plain.

915
01:08:53,259 --> 01:08:54,019
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just plain.

916
01:08:54,859 --> 01:08:59,261
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, whereas you can get some interfaces like a lot of the Step Mania skins I've seen out there.

917
01:08:59,801 --> 01:09:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really cool looking.

918
01:09:01,162 --> 01:09:03,083
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really, you know, complex looking.

919
01:09:03,143 --> 01:09:05,704
[SPEAKER_03]: They're really, you know, like, wow, I gotta play that game.

920
01:09:05,744 --> 01:09:06,404
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks cool.

921
01:09:07,136 --> 01:09:11,138
[SPEAKER_03]: versus, wow, it's another dancing game.

922
01:09:11,518 --> 01:09:12,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.

923
01:09:13,299 --> 01:09:21,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, we've got to include all this crap to get you to buy this game because we're going to fail when it comes to selling against DDR.

924
01:09:21,924 --> 01:09:22,284
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

925
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:26,887
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to buy this game because they're going to be like, oh, I've got to put it in the group so they make more games.

926
01:09:28,327 --> 01:09:29,208
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, no.

927
01:09:29,728 --> 01:09:31,049
[SPEAKER_03]: It's whatever.

928
01:09:31,649 --> 01:09:33,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very curious to see how it plays.

929
01:09:34,690 --> 01:09:39,152
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious to see how it plays out, too, because I think it is going to be competition.

930
01:09:39,492 --> 01:09:40,732
[SPEAKER_02]: We got into this a couple weeks ago.

931
01:09:40,772 --> 01:09:47,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to revisit, but I think the Red Octane partnership is going to prove it's going to make in the group some serious competition.

932
01:09:47,734 --> 01:09:48,235
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do.

933
01:09:48,575 --> 01:09:51,676
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the game is good enough, certainly, where it can.

934
01:09:52,236 --> 01:09:59,158
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we're talking it's Mad Catz dance craze or whatever that fucking game was on GameCube that sucks.

935
01:09:59,418 --> 01:10:00,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good dance game.

936
01:10:00,859 --> 01:10:01,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have flaws?

937
01:10:02,179 --> 01:10:02,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

938
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:03,640
[SPEAKER_02]: But is it good?

939
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:04,360
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it solid?

940
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:05,860
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprisingly so.

941
01:10:06,701 --> 01:10:08,321
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see.

942
01:10:09,102 --> 01:10:09,542
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see.

943
01:10:11,122 --> 01:10:13,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well, I'm getting blink, blink, blinks.

944
01:10:14,784 --> 01:10:15,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

945
01:10:15,944 --> 01:10:19,586
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess we'll do a break time, then we'll come back, maybe do some Skype line.

946
01:10:19,906 --> 01:10:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: How does that sound?

947
01:10:21,227 --> 01:10:22,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Let our listeners talk back?

948
01:10:22,247 --> 01:10:22,667
[SPEAKER_26]: Yeah, good work.

949
01:10:22,967 --> 01:10:23,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we'll do that.

950
01:10:23,808 --> 01:10:26,729
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back, we're going to let you guys interact with our show.

951
01:10:26,749 --> 01:10:33,171
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and we'll be taking some calls when we get back from this break.

952
01:10:33,692 --> 01:10:34,532
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break...

953
01:10:35,632 --> 01:10:40,054
[SPEAKER_02]: Pope Puri, whatever I feel like playing, and whatever Jamie tells me to play.

954
01:10:41,015 --> 01:10:46,458
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to start it off with, since we've been doing 2DX all night, I think it's time to do some DDR.

955
01:10:48,539 --> 01:10:50,199
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.

956
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:51,740
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get that in there, Jamie.

957
01:10:52,761 --> 01:10:57,203
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start it off with, I want to start off with something from Xtreme.

958
01:10:57,863 --> 01:10:59,204
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some Blue Impulse.

959
01:11:01,125 --> 01:11:02,746
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, fuck, I have a story about Bag.

960
01:11:02,766 --> 01:11:02,866
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

961
01:11:05,124 --> 01:11:05,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell the bags.

962
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:08,287
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to do the break of songs everybody hates.

963
01:11:08,567 --> 01:11:09,307
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you want to do that?

964
01:11:09,367 --> 01:11:09,828
[SPEAKER_02]: We can do that.

965
01:11:10,088 --> 01:11:11,189
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, forget Blue Impulse then.

966
01:11:11,389 --> 01:11:11,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Let them move.

967
01:11:14,091 --> 01:11:15,872
[SPEAKER_05]: No, except let them move because that song's been banned.

968
01:11:16,913 --> 01:11:17,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

969
01:11:17,333 --> 01:11:18,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I may be a balloon.

970
01:11:19,455 --> 01:11:20,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that song's been banned too.

971
01:11:20,916 --> 01:11:21,416
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, banned.

972
01:11:21,756 --> 01:11:23,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to do a break of songs we hate.

973
01:11:24,558 --> 01:11:24,859
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

974
01:11:25,359 --> 01:11:27,200
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

975
01:11:28,241 --> 01:11:29,602
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to give me a minute to queue these up.

976
01:11:29,662 --> 01:11:30,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so what song are we starting off with?

977
01:11:30,963 --> 01:11:31,503
[SPEAKER_24]: Sorry.

978
01:11:31,724 --> 01:11:32,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

979
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:35,871
[SPEAKER_03]: I finished the bag of gummy bears.

980
01:11:36,471 --> 01:11:37,111
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you now?

981
01:11:37,611 --> 01:11:38,031
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.

982
01:11:38,151 --> 01:11:38,751
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta get more.

983
01:11:39,132 --> 01:11:39,972
[SPEAKER_05]: How long did that take?

984
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:40,332
[SPEAKER_05]: A month?

985
01:11:41,212 --> 01:11:41,792
[SPEAKER_05]: Not even.

986
01:11:41,952 --> 01:11:43,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a couple, like a week or so.

987
01:11:45,233 --> 01:11:45,653
[SPEAKER_03]: Two weeks.

988
01:11:45,893 --> 01:11:51,295
[SPEAKER_02]: I only have, strangely enough, I only have bag from the non-stop.

989
01:11:52,635 --> 01:11:53,736
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's really scary?

990
01:11:53,756 --> 01:11:54,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we'll do it.

991
01:11:54,296 --> 01:11:54,516
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

992
01:11:55,196 --> 01:11:57,857
[SPEAKER_03]: They played Junior today on SyFy.

993
01:11:57,877 --> 01:11:58,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, anyway.

994
01:11:59,917 --> 01:12:00,857
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

995
01:12:00,997 --> 01:12:02,258
[SPEAKER_02]: A break of dinner songs we hate.

996
01:12:02,278 --> 01:12:02,698
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back.

997
01:13:21,756 --> 01:13:28,222
[SPEAKER_17]: Check one, check one, when I come down, I come down right to the sun.

998
01:13:28,262 --> 01:13:30,604
Get right down, get right down to the gym.

999
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:51,943
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kicking the boat, don't you know, Bobby Joe?

1000
01:13:52,303 --> 01:14:01,891
[SPEAKER_15]: When I come around, I get down, when I get down, I'm down Get right down, I'm down I said one, two, three, four Come on, y'all, I get on the floor Get right down, get right down, I'm down, I'm down

1001
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:21,012
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

1002
01:14:42,109 --> 01:14:43,270
Thank you for watching

1003
01:15:10,376 --> 01:15:11,477
[SPEAKER_15]: Blow my whistle, baby.

1004
01:15:11,497 --> 01:15:12,657
[SPEAKER_15]: Blow my whistle, baby.

1005
01:15:12,677 --> 01:15:14,378
Open up and put it in.

1006
01:15:14,418 --> 01:15:15,079
Let's begin.

1007
01:15:52,158 --> 01:15:53,140
Let me hear you sing!

1008
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:40,170
[SPEAKER_15]: Slow my whistle baby

1009
01:18:15,456 --> 01:18:18,662
[SPEAKER_26]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

1010
01:18:18,942 --> 01:18:19,423
[SPEAKER_18]: No!

1011
01:18:21,226 --> 01:18:21,887
[SPEAKER_26]: Just kidding.

1012
01:18:22,308 --> 01:18:24,973
[SPEAKER_26]: Orange Lounge Radio, Crap Free Bavani Radio.

1013
01:18:26,966 --> 01:18:28,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag is a horde song.

1014
01:18:55,595 --> 01:19:04,143
[SPEAKER_02]: People play Bagged to Death because it's a ten-footer, and they'll play it on three-speed, and then when they pass it, they're like, oh my gods, I passed a ten-footer.

1015
01:19:04,883 --> 01:19:12,030
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, because of the way the song sounds, it's one of those songs you can hear from across the arcade when somebody's playing it.

1016
01:19:15,133 --> 01:19:18,896
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, oh god, somebody's trying to pass a ten-footer over there.

1017
01:19:19,326 --> 01:19:26,955
[SPEAKER_08]: Even real bagpipe music when you're standing next to the pipist, the piper, sorry, does not sound as annoying.

1018
01:19:27,615 --> 01:19:36,265
[SPEAKER_08]: I love bagpipe music, not when I'm standing right next to the piper, because then it's deafening, but I would rather go deaf from listening to real bagpipes.

1019
01:19:36,590 --> 01:19:37,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Cheng Ma, Love This Feelin'

1020
01:20:04,352 --> 01:20:05,233
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1021
01:20:24,828 --> 01:20:34,266
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as I know, and correct me if I'm wrong on this statement, and I'm sure the chat room will, but I believe it was the first DDR song that had a tempo change.

1022
01:20:35,848 --> 01:20:36,009
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1023
01:20:36,568 --> 01:20:40,452
[SPEAKER_02]: and now, tempo changes are really horrid in DDR.

1024
01:20:40,872 --> 01:20:55,346
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I was playing Ultramix 2 online today, I was playing some Controller, Controller Revolution, but I, just to cover my ass here, I specifically looked for a room on Ultramix that said Controller Fun, so that we would, you know, be playing with controller people, so I wouldn't, you know, be playing with pad people.

1025
01:20:55,886 --> 01:20:55,946
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1026
01:20:56,867 --> 01:20:58,968
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Alligator Project, The Whistle Song

1027
01:21:20,909 --> 01:21:22,669
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that song so much.

1028
01:21:22,970 --> 01:21:25,150
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, again, it's just horrid.

1029
01:21:25,650 --> 01:21:28,551
[SPEAKER_02]: And the song is Blow My Whistle Bitch.

1030
01:21:29,211 --> 01:21:32,291
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't like the fact that they censored it in the actual song.

1031
01:21:32,551 --> 01:21:33,972
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't censor the background.

1032
01:21:34,112 --> 01:21:36,192
[SPEAKER_02]: It still says Blow My Whistle Bitch, but they censored the song.

1033
01:21:36,412 --> 01:21:39,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, they have both versions on his album.

1034
01:21:39,453 --> 01:21:41,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have his album.

1035
01:21:41,913 --> 01:21:42,353
[SPEAKER_03]: The vinyl.

1036
01:21:42,453 --> 01:21:43,514
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, why?

1037
01:21:45,394 --> 01:21:47,595
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was collecting DDR music.

1038
01:21:47,815 --> 01:21:48,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, whatever.

1039
01:21:48,675 --> 01:21:49,635
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose I can let that slide.

1040
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:51,899
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's another one of those songs.

1041
01:21:51,920 --> 01:22:03,645
[SPEAKER_02]: You can hear it from across the arcade, and I swear to God, you could be sitting over on, like, Derby Owners Club or something, you can hear, wee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.

1042
01:22:04,425 --> 01:22:06,446
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh God, somebody saw off the machine.

1043
01:22:06,786 --> 01:22:07,366
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1044
01:22:07,766 --> 01:22:11,028
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing would be fun to play, like, Bag 2.

1045
01:22:11,628 --> 01:22:12,729
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Final Furlong.

1046
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:15,950
[SPEAKER_10]: And then we played Max 300.

1047
01:22:20,919 --> 01:22:24,321
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1048
01:22:48,197 --> 01:22:48,558
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevermind.

1049
01:22:50,200 --> 01:22:50,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1050
01:22:52,924 --> 01:23:01,116
[SPEAKER_02]: As promised, we are going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys that want to give a little bit of feedback on the program.

1051
01:23:01,156 --> 01:23:02,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe you have something you want to share with us.

1052
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,161
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1053
01:23:05,309 --> 01:23:08,231
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeloungeradio.com

1054
01:23:23,898 --> 01:23:26,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Echo123 Echo123 Hey Sky, Siggy here Just woke up, as usual

1055
01:23:53,080 --> 01:23:55,801
[SPEAKER_02]: So you must be pretty excited about the 9th style coming out this week.

1056
01:23:56,141 --> 01:23:57,062
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yes.

1057
01:23:57,262 --> 01:23:59,683
[SPEAKER_02]: And the early release news, that's pretty exciting.

1058
01:24:00,243 --> 01:24:04,985
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, according to PlayAsia, they released it today in Hong Kong.

1059
01:24:05,765 --> 01:24:07,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, very interesting.

1060
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:07,906
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1061
01:24:09,067 --> 01:24:11,528
[SPEAKER_04]: The release date is March 21st, which is tomorrow.

1062
01:24:12,008 --> 01:24:12,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1063
01:24:13,989 --> 01:24:19,431
[SPEAKER_04]: But before I get into the 9th style business, I just want to say some local news here in Vegas.

1064
01:24:20,143 --> 01:24:25,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, we appreciate local news, because we talk about Sacramento way too much on this show, so we need to hear from other communities.

1065
01:24:25,986 --> 01:24:26,767
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's up in Vegas?

1066
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:29,968
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, um, how should I say it?

1067
01:24:30,209 --> 01:24:33,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Circus Circus Adventure Dome's gonna get 2DX Red by tomorrow.

1068
01:24:34,591 --> 01:24:36,352
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my, that's very interesting.

1069
01:24:36,492 --> 01:24:40,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I usually stay at Circus Circus when I go to Vegas, because it's fucking cheap.

1070
01:24:41,815 --> 01:24:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've been to the Adventure Dome, um...

1071
01:24:46,135 --> 01:24:51,538
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I think that was one of the first places... Actually, the first place I ever played DDR was Circus Circus, but it wasn't in the Adventure Dome.

1072
01:24:51,858 --> 01:24:53,279
[SPEAKER_02]: It was in the arcade they had there.

1073
01:24:53,699 --> 01:24:54,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Midway.

1074
01:24:54,520 --> 01:24:54,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1075
01:24:55,140 --> 01:24:56,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, the Midway area.

1076
01:24:57,281 --> 01:24:57,501
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh.

1077
01:24:57,922 --> 01:24:59,362
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're getting 2DX Red, huh?

1078
01:24:59,903 --> 01:25:00,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

1079
01:25:00,443 --> 01:25:01,383
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Adventure Dome.

1080
01:25:01,403 --> 01:25:02,204
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so weird to me.

1081
01:25:02,724 --> 01:25:04,965
[SPEAKER_02]: What caused them to decide to jump there?

1082
01:25:05,065 --> 01:25:06,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Have they been successful with 8-Style, or...?

1083
01:25:07,447 --> 01:25:09,428
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's probably the locals.

1084
01:25:09,848 --> 01:25:11,109
[SPEAKER_04]: The locals have been demanding it.

1085
01:25:11,809 --> 01:25:12,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1086
01:25:13,010 --> 01:25:13,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

1087
01:25:14,030 --> 01:25:15,011
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to let us know how that goes.

1088
01:25:16,107 --> 01:25:17,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure thing.

1089
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:18,168
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll take pictures.

1090
01:25:19,609 --> 01:25:21,110
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else to share with the Vegas scene?

1091
01:25:22,111 --> 01:25:23,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's only about it.

1092
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:24,193
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1093
01:25:24,413 --> 01:25:29,796
[SPEAKER_04]: There's already, you know, some news about getting in the groove here in Vegas.

1094
01:25:30,297 --> 01:25:31,337
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know which arcade.

1095
01:25:32,638 --> 01:25:32,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

1096
01:25:34,340 --> 01:25:38,202
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, with in the groove 2 coming out just around the corner, maybe you guys ought to hold off at this point.

1097
01:25:39,483 --> 01:25:39,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Who knows?

1098
01:25:40,324 --> 01:25:42,645
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not an in the groove person, so... Yeah, I know.

1099
01:25:42,865 --> 01:25:43,346
[SPEAKER_02]: I know how it is.

1100
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:45,167
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel your pain.

1101
01:25:45,814 --> 01:25:47,734
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, let's get into Nightstyle.

1102
01:25:47,774 --> 01:25:48,334
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's.

1103
01:25:48,935 --> 01:25:56,376
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to post a link to the website, to a website that has pictures of Nightstyle in it.

1104
01:25:56,956 --> 01:26:01,417
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, alright, so you can read that in our chat room, www.orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.

1105
01:26:01,777 --> 01:26:03,157
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the link, I just saw it pop up.

1106
01:26:04,497 --> 01:26:09,798
[SPEAKER_04]: What's interesting about Nightstyle CS is, you know, the main menu is actually mode select.

1107
01:26:12,599 --> 01:26:13,859
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the arcade mode select.

1108
01:26:14,215 --> 01:26:17,717
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm trying to bring it up myself over here right now.

1109
01:26:18,137 --> 01:26:20,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is weird because all the pictures are on its side.

1110
01:26:21,119 --> 01:26:23,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, tilt your head.

1111
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:24,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I tilt my monitor here.

1112
01:26:25,341 --> 01:26:28,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so the main select screen is... Mode select.

1113
01:26:28,623 --> 01:26:29,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Mode select, that's kind of weird.

1114
01:26:30,864 --> 01:26:32,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the actual picture of it.

1115
01:26:34,186 --> 01:26:36,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me paste it to... Okay.

1116
01:26:37,848 --> 01:26:38,108
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.

1117
01:26:46,795 --> 01:26:49,008
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the main screen, huh, when you turn on the game?

1118
01:26:50,094 --> 01:26:50,476
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, wow

1119
01:26:51,556 --> 01:26:54,878
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so the main menu screen has various options on it.

1120
01:26:54,978 --> 01:26:56,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Free, training, original, gallery.

1121
01:26:57,380 --> 01:27:02,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of what you're used to seeing, but the way it's set up, it almost looks like you're just jumping right into the game.

1122
01:27:02,464 --> 01:27:08,247
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really no, you know, fancy... Like, I don't know, like, Sixth Style kind of had its own fancy menu.

1123
01:27:08,488 --> 01:27:10,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, that sounds rushed.

1124
01:27:11,029 --> 01:27:12,711
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at least we're getting it.

1125
01:27:12,811 --> 01:27:13,871
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I can't complain.

1126
01:27:13,891 --> 01:27:15,012
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least we're getting it.

1127
01:27:15,312 --> 01:27:17,434
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, at least that car has three of its wheels.

1128
01:27:17,594 --> 01:27:18,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

1129
01:27:20,492 --> 01:27:21,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so that's interesting.

1130
01:27:22,193 --> 01:27:22,433
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1131
01:27:22,933 --> 01:27:37,239
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the music list, on the official Nine Style CS website, on the very bottom, it says that number 13, Beyond the Earth, and Sakuretsu, Yega Denko Chop, or Yega Final Attack, are three unlovable songs.

1132
01:27:37,259 --> 01:27:38,060
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like me.

1133
01:27:40,381 --> 01:27:41,901
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's cool.

1134
01:27:42,602 --> 01:27:43,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I was surprised by the number 13.

1135
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:50,165
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'd heard the thing, I think you had mentioned it a couple weeks ago, but to see that officially, that was pretty neat.

1136
01:27:52,679 --> 01:27:54,941
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'm interested to hear the new Jaeger.

1137
01:27:55,202 --> 01:27:57,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Have the MP3s leaked to the internet yet?

1138
01:27:58,104 --> 01:27:58,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Nope.

1139
01:27:58,685 --> 01:28:00,066
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time, my friend.

1140
01:28:01,947 --> 01:28:03,669
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably within this week or next week.

1141
01:28:04,062 --> 01:28:04,542
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1142
01:28:30,856 --> 01:28:37,119
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm quite happy that some songs that made a comeback on Night Style CS, for example, like Empathy.

1143
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,841
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a little surprised by the comeback list, too.

1144
01:28:40,881 --> 01:28:49,385
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some good things in it, and then there were songs like V, where I'm like, God damn, do we need V again?

1145
01:28:50,086 --> 01:28:58,210
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm done with V. I'm over V. I never played a comic concept before.

1146
01:28:58,732 --> 01:29:01,493
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a fun one.

1147
01:29:01,573 --> 01:29:05,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't that the one that slows down suddenly and then speeds up?

1148
01:29:06,694 --> 01:29:10,355
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that was one of the first songs I saw on 2DX, was that song.

1149
01:29:10,375 --> 01:29:12,095
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, God, that song is hot.

1150
01:29:12,115 --> 01:29:15,256
[SPEAKER_04]: You just wanted to say that so you could pronounce it and show your little...

1151
01:29:25,785 --> 01:29:27,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Manatsu no Hana, Manatsu no Yume by Sana

1152
01:29:53,817 --> 01:30:01,664
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, I just... Take it as a compliment, take it as a compliment, that I'm just, I'm doing the blinking thing, I can't understand, I'm sorry.

1153
01:30:02,224 --> 01:30:03,485
[SPEAKER_02]: So, alright.

1154
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:07,188
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, are you going to call us next week and let us know what you think about it?

1155
01:30:07,929 --> 01:30:09,270
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, yeah, I'll call you next week.

1156
01:30:09,370 --> 01:30:13,053
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, do that, because we're poor, so we have to live vicariously through other folks.

1157
01:30:13,613 --> 01:30:16,496
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm hoping Jamie will have it soon, and she'll bring it over and let us all play.

1158
01:30:16,956 --> 01:30:18,998
[SPEAKER_08]: If I get it, I'll know my birthday's next month.

1159
01:30:21,744 --> 01:30:24,689
[SPEAKER_02]: I just said I'm poor, don't be looking at me.

1160
01:30:24,769 --> 01:30:25,270
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

1161
01:30:25,971 --> 01:30:26,272
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1162
01:30:26,933 --> 01:30:28,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, well thanks for the call, Siggy.

1163
01:30:28,055 --> 01:30:28,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a good one.

1164
01:30:29,116 --> 01:30:29,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

1165
01:30:29,517 --> 01:30:29,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1166
01:30:30,218 --> 01:30:30,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1167
01:30:32,165 --> 01:30:33,166
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1168
01:30:54,847 --> 01:30:57,127
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in our chatroom.

1169
01:30:57,547 --> 01:30:58,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And send us $5.

1170
01:30:58,788 --> 01:30:59,748
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you don't have to send us $5.

1171
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't listen to Loki.

1172
01:31:01,328 --> 01:31:02,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all free.

1173
01:31:02,108 --> 01:31:05,689
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in our chatroom to vote.

1174
01:31:05,949 --> 01:31:06,589
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the way it works.

1175
01:31:06,629 --> 01:31:07,309
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get into it.

1176
01:31:09,730 --> 01:31:13,030
[SPEAKER_02]: In last week's cage match, we had a brand new winner.

1177
01:31:13,910 --> 01:31:16,571
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we've had a couple one-week victories lately.

1178
01:31:16,671 --> 01:31:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if this one will win for one week or if it'll hold on.

1179
01:31:20,291 --> 01:31:22,692
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a remix of an old-school 90s song.

1180
01:31:24,190 --> 01:31:25,030
[SPEAKER_02]: What Is Love?

1181
01:31:25,351 --> 01:31:26,051
[SPEAKER_02]: by Hataway.

1182
01:31:26,131 --> 01:31:26,991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's What Is Love?

1183
01:31:27,331 --> 01:31:28,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Reloaded.

1184
01:31:28,632 --> 01:31:31,073
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we'll see what you guys think about this one.

1185
01:31:32,834 --> 01:31:34,535
[SPEAKER_02]: You did vote it as your winner last week.

1186
01:31:34,595 --> 01:31:36,816
[SPEAKER_02]: You may vote it again tonight, or you may not.

1187
01:31:36,936 --> 01:31:37,676
[SPEAKER_02]: It's up to you guys.

1188
01:31:38,537 --> 01:31:44,459
[SPEAKER_02]: As a reminder, we only play a clip of the first song because you got to hear the song in its entirety last week.

1189
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:48,141
[SPEAKER_02]: And we want to let this segment only take up a little bit of time.

1190
01:31:48,181 --> 01:31:50,002
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't have to take up all day.

1191
01:31:50,422 --> 01:31:50,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

1192
01:31:51,209 --> 01:31:52,650
[SPEAKER_02]: Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

01:32:24,111 --> 01:32:24,693
What is love?

1196
01:33:17,366 --> 01:33:28,694
Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more

1197
01:34:01,246 --> 01:34:05,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number one, last week's winner, Hadaway, What Is Love.

1198
01:34:06,810 --> 01:34:12,994
[SPEAKER_02]: We shall see if it wins again tonight, or if it will bow down to one of our two other entries tonight.

1199
01:34:13,094 --> 01:34:14,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with Loki's pick.

1200
01:34:15,336 --> 01:34:17,117
[SPEAKER_02]: And Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1201
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:25,463
[SPEAKER_03]: I picked our fellow friend and Kumani artist, MidiHead.

1202
01:34:25,603 --> 01:34:30,446
[SPEAKER_03]: He released an exclusive track to us people that bought his albums.

1203
01:34:31,461 --> 01:34:34,684
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for you guys, it's White Knuckle Ride.

1204
01:34:35,144 --> 01:34:36,405
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, enjoy!

1205
01:34:38,607 --> 01:34:40,609
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two, Mini Head, White Knuckle Ride.

1206
01:34:40,629 --> 01:34:53,240
[SPEAKER_02]: White Knuckle Ride

1207
01:37:15,394 --> 01:37:15,979
Thanks for watching!

1208
01:38:47,813 --> 01:38:48,373
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm here.

1209
01:38:48,534 --> 01:38:48,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

1210
01:38:49,815 --> 01:38:52,016
[SPEAKER_02]: We're having a picto chat orgy here in the studio.

1211
01:38:52,036 --> 01:38:53,858
[SPEAKER_02]: Had to take a break from it for a minute.

1212
01:38:54,378 --> 01:38:58,302
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, that was song number two, Midi Head, White Knuckle Ride.

1213
01:38:58,982 --> 01:38:59,783
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

1214
01:39:01,024 --> 01:39:02,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with DarkSakura.

1215
01:39:02,345 --> 01:39:03,646
[SPEAKER_08]: I still hate that man's voice.

1216
01:39:03,966 --> 01:39:04,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1217
01:39:04,647 --> 01:39:05,688
[SPEAKER_02]: But he's so cool.

1218
01:39:05,828 --> 01:39:06,448
[SPEAKER_08]: He's cool.

1219
01:39:06,488 --> 01:39:07,289
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't get me wrong.

1220
01:39:07,889 --> 01:39:09,090
[SPEAKER_08]: I just don't like his voice.

1221
01:39:09,631 --> 01:39:10,972
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he can sing very well.

1222
01:39:11,693 --> 01:39:14,475
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it would have had a ten.

1223
01:39:15,967 --> 01:39:17,888
[SPEAKER_08]: By virtue of voice, it gets an 8 instead.

1224
01:39:18,368 --> 01:39:18,728
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1225
01:39:19,949 --> 01:39:20,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's got a mic over there?

1226
01:39:21,809 --> 01:39:22,209
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

1227
01:39:26,831 --> 01:39:31,872
[SPEAKER_25]: It's not a steaming pile of poo, but... It's alright.

1228
01:39:32,193 --> 01:39:32,973
[SPEAKER_25]: Probably gets a 7.

1229
01:39:33,213 --> 01:39:35,834
[SPEAKER_25]: It's got a good beat behind it, though.

1230
01:39:38,295 --> 01:39:39,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Angel.

1231
01:39:40,555 --> 01:39:40,715
Ow.

1232
01:39:41,456 --> 01:39:41,996
[SPEAKER_10]: Head rush.

1233
01:39:42,116 --> 01:39:42,596
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, um...

1234
01:39:44,458 --> 01:39:48,041
[SPEAKER_10]: 8 because I like mini heads and stuff.

1235
01:39:48,361 --> 01:39:50,582
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, bye.

1236
01:39:50,682 --> 01:39:53,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Me personally, I actually thought that song was pretty fucking rad.

1237
01:39:53,604 --> 01:39:55,225
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of his better tracks.

1238
01:39:55,446 --> 01:39:57,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of want to keep that one for myself.

1239
01:39:57,767 --> 01:39:59,208
[SPEAKER_02]: So I give it a 9.5.

1240
01:40:00,009 --> 01:40:00,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1241
01:40:01,089 --> 01:40:02,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, there's a microphone being shoved in my face.

1242
01:40:04,051 --> 01:40:07,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's cool.

1243
01:40:07,394 --> 01:40:07,794
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1244
01:40:07,874 --> 01:40:08,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I picked it.

1245
01:40:10,135 --> 01:40:10,796
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a 10.

1246
01:40:11,716 --> 01:40:12,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1247
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:15,555
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into song number three.

1248
01:40:15,676 --> 01:40:18,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number three is DarkSakura's pick.

1249
01:40:18,238 --> 01:40:19,359
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you pick for us tonight?

1250
01:40:21,640 --> 01:40:23,482
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, I like Yoko Kanno.

1251
01:40:23,522 --> 01:40:25,844
[SPEAKER_08]: She's really cool and she's a neat person in person.

1252
01:40:26,404 --> 01:40:31,268
[SPEAKER_08]: She signed our Macross Plus CD at AX like a while back.

1253
01:40:31,969 --> 01:40:34,391
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, anyway, this is one from, uh,

1254
01:40:36,006 --> 01:40:39,709
[SPEAKER_08]: She did this on the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex.

1255
01:40:39,829 --> 01:40:40,629
[SPEAKER_08]: It's Rise.

1256
01:40:41,270 --> 01:40:45,092
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to remember who sent it to me because I think it's in the chat room right now, but I don't remember, so sorry.

1257
01:40:45,973 --> 01:40:46,353
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1258
01:40:47,273 --> 01:40:48,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Yoko Kanno, Rise.

1259
01:40:49,155 --> 01:40:49,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy.

1260
01:41:18,792 --> 01:41:23,056
I'm a soldier, that's it, yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah, yeah

1261
01:42:04,107 --> 01:42:04,412
Thank you.

1262
01:44:30,959 --> 01:44:31,539
S, Actdeft,

1263
01:46:21,684 --> 01:46:25,967
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, song number three there, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

1264
01:46:26,127 --> 01:46:29,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that one rise to the cage match occasion, or did it fall flat on its ass?

1265
01:46:30,009 --> 01:46:30,750
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, Jamie.

1266
01:46:31,130 --> 01:46:33,512
[SPEAKER_08]: Yoko Kanno is awesome, so this one gets a nine and a half.

1267
01:46:34,752 --> 01:46:35,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

1268
01:46:35,973 --> 01:46:37,834
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty nice, I'd say eight.

1269
01:46:38,615 --> 01:46:39,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Angel.

1270
01:46:41,657 --> 01:46:41,837
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight.

1271
01:46:43,298 --> 01:46:46,240
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like that a lot, it sounded like it should be in the fifth element.

1272
01:46:46,340 --> 01:46:46,600
[SPEAKER_02]: Nine.

1273
01:46:47,380 --> 01:46:47,701
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

1274
01:46:50,643 --> 01:46:51,183
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a seven.

1275
01:46:52,765 --> 01:46:56,968
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, but remember, our votes don't count for shit.

1276
01:46:57,048 --> 01:46:59,269
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all up to you guys to pick a wiener.

1277
01:47:00,209 --> 01:47:04,792
[SPEAKER_02]: So here you go, three songs for you to pick from.

1278
01:47:05,352 --> 01:47:09,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one you can vote for tonight, Hadaway, What Is Love, Reloaded.

1279
01:47:15,958 --> 01:47:21,922
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two you can vote for tonight is Midi Head with White Knuckle Ride.

1280
01:47:29,918 --> 01:47:34,080
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1281
01:47:42,423 --> 01:47:45,445
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is a very hard cage match to decide tonight.

1282
01:47:45,465 --> 01:47:49,066
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got three really good songs in here tonight, so this is going to be an interesting one.

1283
01:47:49,766 --> 01:47:51,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now.

1284
01:47:51,907 --> 01:47:55,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1285
01:47:56,883 --> 01:48:03,787
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I know the chatroom likes to bitch a lot, that sometimes we give them three crappy songs to pick from, but I seriously don't think you can complain about that tonight.

1286
01:48:04,187 --> 01:48:19,216
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got some old school beats there with the What Is Love, you've got some new school, like industrial sounding stuff with a midi head, and then you've got the J, like, I don't want to call it J-pop, but the J-opera rock or something, I don't know, with the Yoko Kanno.

1287
01:48:19,256 --> 01:48:22,958
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's definitely something to choose from, from every spectrum there, some good songs.

1288
01:48:23,019 --> 01:48:25,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So good luck you guys trying to figure that one out, should be a close one.

1289
01:48:26,038 --> 01:48:27,362
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky with your vote.

1290
01:48:28,665 --> 01:48:29,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting some votes in right now.

1291
01:48:31,042 --> 01:48:35,105
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a question from AsianBuddyPaul in our chat room.

1292
01:48:35,485 --> 01:48:39,728
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to check in on the Ultracade kicking gallery that we're going to have.

1293
01:48:40,348 --> 01:48:42,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to work on that last week.

1294
01:48:42,669 --> 01:48:51,615
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a photo from one of our other listeners send in a photo of him kicking an Ultracade machine and was wondering where you can send in those pictures.

1295
01:48:52,035 --> 01:48:54,597
[SPEAKER_02]: Send those to Rob at OrangeLandRadio.com.

1296
01:48:54,617 --> 01:48:56,738
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and just take charge with setting up the gallery.

1297
01:48:57,058 --> 01:48:57,959
[SPEAKER_02]: So go ahead and send those.

1298
01:48:58,019 --> 01:48:59,640
[SPEAKER_02]: If you happen to send them to Jamie...

1299
01:49:00,100 --> 01:49:03,626
[SPEAKER_02]: or Matt, they will make sure I get them or they'll get them in the gallery themselves.

1300
01:49:03,767 --> 01:49:04,708
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can go ahead and send those to me.

1301
01:49:04,768 --> 01:49:10,738
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob at OrangeLawnRadio.com In fact, I'm kind of curious if he sent it already because if he did, I want to show it to the folks in the studio.

1302
01:49:11,079 --> 01:49:12,021
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I love...

1303
01:49:12,865 --> 01:49:14,165
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultracade kicking pictures.

1304
01:49:14,505 --> 01:49:21,827
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, please remind Loki or Jamie, I know you're both in on this, why should folks be sending us pictures of them kicking Ultracade machines?

1305
01:49:21,947 --> 01:49:29,168
[SPEAKER_08]: Because Ultracade is trying to trademark the MAME name, because MAME already belongs to somebody else.

1306
01:49:30,028 --> 01:49:32,969
[SPEAKER_08]: So this person is a big retard, so we have to kick Ultracade machines.

1307
01:49:33,129 --> 01:49:33,809
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is, look at that.

1308
01:49:33,969 --> 01:49:34,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely kick.

1309
01:49:34,849 --> 01:49:35,869
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not even a kick.

1310
01:49:35,889 --> 01:49:38,290
[SPEAKER_02]: They are kicking the actual panel there.

1311
01:49:38,945 --> 01:49:40,646
[SPEAKER_02]: That owns.

1312
01:49:40,786 --> 01:49:43,508
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a you-could-get-busted in the arcade picture right there.

1313
01:49:43,608 --> 01:49:46,389
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, our buddy Paul there, for sending us that.

1314
01:49:46,409 --> 01:49:46,990
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great pick.

1315
01:49:47,570 --> 01:49:51,532
[SPEAKER_03]: Sadly enough, the abuse of these cabinets is going to have to take.

1316
01:49:51,753 --> 01:49:56,575
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't actually kick the Altercade components, because, I mean, Altercade is put in these cabinets.

1317
01:49:57,056 --> 01:49:59,617
[SPEAKER_03]: The cabinets have no say what games inside of them.

1318
01:49:59,757 --> 01:50:01,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Kick the right side where it hits the JAMA harness.

1319
01:50:02,379 --> 01:50:04,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you have to kick the JAMA harness.

1320
01:50:04,861 --> 01:50:11,027
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but actually just kick any part of it, because a lot of these cabins are sold with it already in there, so... You know what?

1321
01:50:12,228 --> 01:50:13,510
[SPEAKER_03]: They're guilty by association.

1322
01:50:13,530 --> 01:50:14,931
[SPEAKER_25]: Think of the cabinets, though.

1323
01:50:15,131 --> 01:50:18,554
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you get busted... No, I want the disclaimer here.

1324
01:50:20,236 --> 01:50:21,818
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not tell you to do this.

1325
01:50:23,139 --> 01:50:25,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to get angry letters from your arcade owner.

1326
01:50:25,521 --> 01:50:26,222
[SPEAKER_02]: You should...

1327
01:50:29,249 --> 01:50:36,451
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't pose like you're kicking the machine, but don't really kick it because we don't want to get your arcade owners upset.

1328
01:50:36,751 --> 01:50:39,932
[SPEAKER_25]: And if you do, and if they're mad, we don't know you.

1329
01:50:39,952 --> 01:50:40,593
[SPEAKER_25]: And we disown you.

1330
01:50:40,613 --> 01:50:41,353
[SPEAKER_25]: You were never here.

1331
01:50:41,473 --> 01:50:41,933
[SPEAKER_26]: That's right.

1332
01:50:43,934 --> 01:50:44,314
[SPEAKER_26]: All right.

1333
01:50:48,615 --> 01:50:55,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, you know I always ask you this around this time of the show, and even if there's no news, I have to ask you anyway.

1334
01:50:55,257 --> 01:50:57,898
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell is going on in the sim scene, my friend?

1335
01:50:59,201 --> 01:51:04,465
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going on is this fucking AIM is attached to goddamn Outlook Express, and that makes me angry.

1336
01:51:05,186 --> 01:51:06,907
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid Outlook and MAME.

1337
01:51:07,268 --> 01:51:09,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, our... what our AIM.

1338
01:51:10,110 --> 01:51:11,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, SimZine.

1339
01:51:11,971 --> 01:51:15,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, see, only a couple things are actually going on here.

1340
01:51:15,534 --> 01:51:16,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, Matrix Online launch update.

1341
01:51:17,016 --> 01:51:20,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, um, there is... a couple things.

1342
01:51:20,999 --> 01:51:24,782
[SPEAKER_03]: First off, TechnoFiend, they're working on yet another theme.

1343
01:51:25,142 --> 01:51:25,963
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, um...

1344
01:51:26,519 --> 01:51:28,280
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Techno Fiend Retroactive.

1345
01:51:28,340 --> 01:51:31,142
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a yellow version of Techno Fiend.

1346
01:51:31,202 --> 01:51:32,983
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of looks kind of neat.

1347
01:51:33,663 --> 01:51:36,825
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole thread on it on Bumicell, and that's supposed to be coming out.

1348
01:51:37,245 --> 01:51:39,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing new on Funmix, too, as far as I'm aware.

1349
01:51:39,907 --> 01:51:42,468
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to double check, just to be certain on that.

1350
01:51:44,209 --> 01:51:49,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from that, also there's the... God, I can't even remember what it's called now.

1351
01:51:51,034 --> 01:51:51,114
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1352
01:51:52,694 --> 01:51:53,334
[SPEAKER_03]: VIRTUAL VISIONS

1353
01:52:11,460 --> 01:52:18,244
[SPEAKER_03]: and those are all video game remixes and they're making a step file pack for those and that's still going on right now.

1354
01:52:18,685 --> 01:52:20,426
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a big huge forum now.

1355
01:52:20,926 --> 01:52:24,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a section of their forums that you can actually check out.

1356
01:52:27,250 --> 01:52:32,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, DDR Maniacs is saying they're coming back whenever that is.

1357
01:52:33,911 --> 01:52:58,401
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's supposedly gonna happen I mean, not that anyone really cares But MySell's talking about launching version 7 at some point So, and they promised, like, more stuff They remodel their site more than we get new Guitar Freaks arcade mixes Seriously So anyways, that's supposedly happening I checked today to see if there's a new version of Step Mania Guess what?

1358
01:52:58,521 --> 01:52:58,861
[SPEAKER_03]: No!

1359
01:52:59,802 --> 01:53:01,682
[SPEAKER_03]: How long have we been waiting for Step Mania 4.0?

1360
01:53:01,722 --> 01:53:02,123
[SPEAKER_03]: How long?

1361
01:53:03,504 --> 01:53:04,986
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, okay, that's what I'm saying.

1362
01:53:05,266 --> 01:53:06,788
[SPEAKER_03]: No one even cares anymore, I think.

1363
01:53:07,208 --> 01:53:08,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone actually play Setmania?

1364
01:53:09,191 --> 01:53:09,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe.

1365
01:53:09,791 --> 01:53:10,112
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1366
01:53:10,392 --> 01:53:10,612
[SPEAKER_03]: I did.

1367
01:53:12,775 --> 01:53:14,997
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than that, I'm trying to see right now.

1368
01:53:15,318 --> 01:53:18,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go to the FoonMix page to see if there's anything going on there.

1369
01:53:18,842 --> 01:53:23,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I suspect that there might be, but you know, I need to double check.

1370
01:53:24,288 --> 01:53:24,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1371
01:53:25,572 --> 01:53:51,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I was downloading, though, there's, like, you know, you can get a lot of themes and stuff, um, on my, so they have a whole, you know, section and stuff for that, but, um, let's see, Foonmix, Foonmix, Foonmix, here we go, and, what do you know, no news for Foonmix, but it's, uh, Foonmix 2 is still in progress, no date for that, look forward to it coming out, though, pretty soon, I'd imagine, and,

1372
01:53:51,829 --> 01:53:52,510
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!

1373
01:54:01,138 --> 01:54:04,199
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it?

1374
01:54:04,219 --> 01:54:06,779
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRXX Mix.

1375
01:54:07,519 --> 01:54:16,261
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're talking about a release date for April 1st, I believe, was the release date for that one.

1376
01:54:16,621 --> 01:54:23,082
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's supposed to be a big food mix type thing where there's a ton of different things to play.

1377
01:54:23,522 --> 01:54:24,522
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that was the one.

1378
01:54:24,702 --> 01:54:26,242
[SPEAKER_03]: There's one of them that's launching April 1st.

1379
01:54:26,282 --> 01:54:29,883
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember by chance which one that is, but I think it's that one.

1380
01:54:31,071 --> 01:54:31,852
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1381
01:54:32,773 --> 01:54:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's some other people they're releasing, which is kind of neat.

1382
01:54:41,780 --> 01:54:47,964
[SPEAKER_03]: There's in the group stuff that's coming out right now, and then there's also sim files for...

1383
01:54:51,021 --> 01:54:54,465
[SPEAKER_03]: DJ Max that are being released right now.

1384
01:54:54,646 --> 01:54:56,167
[SPEAKER_03]: And the DJ Max songs are pretty cool.

1385
01:54:57,008 --> 01:55:06,360
[SPEAKER_03]: For those who don't know, it's an online Beatmania-type game that was made by the creators of Easy to DJ, the other DJ game that's actually pretty good.

1386
01:55:08,363 --> 01:55:08,723
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

1387
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:12,260
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thank you for that update.

1388
01:55:12,280 --> 01:55:14,201
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a lot longer than I was expecting, actually.

1389
01:55:14,301 --> 01:55:16,963
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually it's, eh, all the signs are down, nobody cares.

1390
01:55:17,503 --> 01:55:20,805
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's nice to know that things are still alive and kicking in the sim scene.

1391
01:55:20,825 --> 01:55:23,807
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to note to the winner of tonight's cage match?

1392
01:55:24,408 --> 01:55:24,948
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, why not?

1393
01:55:25,128 --> 01:55:31,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I thought this would be a very, very close cage match tonight because we had three very good songs.

1394
01:55:31,812 --> 01:55:34,014
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the end, one of these songs just...

1395
01:55:35,083 --> 01:55:38,224
[SPEAKER_02]: For lack of a better term, it really just blew the other two out of the water.

1396
01:55:39,025 --> 01:55:40,025
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know how else to say it.

1397
01:55:40,745 --> 01:55:42,666
[SPEAKER_02]: But this song definitely won tonight.

1398
01:55:42,866 --> 01:55:47,068
[SPEAKER_02]: It is... Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1399
01:55:50,269 --> 01:55:52,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a pretty large portion of the vote tonight.

1400
01:55:52,190 --> 01:55:52,891
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

1401
01:55:52,991 --> 01:55:55,352
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't realize it would be a big gap.

1402
01:55:55,492 --> 01:55:56,212
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't either.

1403
01:55:56,732 --> 01:55:58,413
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm kind of sad by that.

1404
01:55:59,333 --> 01:55:59,733
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1405
01:55:59,853 --> 01:56:00,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming back.

1406
01:56:02,274 --> 01:56:03,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm talking about.

1407
01:56:05,462 --> 01:56:10,943
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so there it is, song number three, Yoko Kanno, Enjoy.

1408
01:56:12,083 --> 01:56:16,824
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be back next week, and we'll see how it fares next week.

1409
01:56:18,344 --> 01:56:22,905
[SPEAKER_27]: Moving right along, should I do another Skype call now, or should I wait?

1410
01:56:23,005 --> 01:56:24,525
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't know if anybody else wants to call in.

1411
01:56:25,425 --> 01:56:26,246
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I'll open it up.

1412
01:56:26,286 --> 01:56:26,926
[SPEAKER_27]: I say break.

1413
01:56:27,466 --> 01:56:28,066
[SPEAKER_02]: You say break?

1414
01:56:28,286 --> 01:56:28,546
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes.

1415
01:56:28,726 --> 01:56:29,726
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, fine, we'll do a break.

1416
01:56:31,286 --> 01:56:32,307
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to break?

1417
01:56:33,407 --> 01:56:34,487
[SPEAKER_02]: I always like to break things.

1418
01:56:36,687 --> 01:56:38,368
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do another call when we get back from this break.

1419
01:56:40,090 --> 01:56:45,554
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, oh, there's a song I really, really want to hear, but it's going to take me a minute to cue it up.

1420
01:56:46,574 --> 01:56:48,296
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need somebody to fill time, please.

1421
01:56:52,779 --> 01:56:53,639
[SPEAKER_08]: I know how to fill time.

1422
01:56:53,680 --> 01:56:56,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about something stupid.

1423
01:56:56,121 --> 01:56:57,062
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

1424
01:56:58,803 --> 01:56:59,684
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about, okay.

1425
01:56:59,704 --> 01:56:59,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1426
01:57:02,788 --> 01:57:04,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so sorry I asked.

1427
01:57:04,969 --> 01:57:06,010
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never do that again.

1428
01:57:06,170 --> 01:57:08,431
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna fill time, okay?

1429
01:57:08,812 --> 01:57:11,073
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is the best filling time I can possibly do.

1430
01:57:11,153 --> 01:57:12,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I gotta switch mics here.

1431
01:57:12,334 --> 01:57:13,454
[SPEAKER_03]: I need one with a longer cord.

1432
01:57:13,934 --> 01:57:14,655
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, just a sec.

1433
01:57:15,776 --> 01:57:16,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, okay.

1434
01:57:19,117 --> 01:57:22,139
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just informed of an interesting fact.

1435
01:57:22,800 --> 01:57:25,601
[SPEAKER_03]: This fact being, we have a peep left!

1436
01:57:26,001 --> 01:57:27,342
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do we do with the peep?

1437
01:57:27,923 --> 01:57:30,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, it goes in the microwave.

1438
01:57:31,368 --> 01:57:31,969
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1439
01:57:55,856 --> 01:57:58,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so one of the peeps is going to go in the microwave.

1440
01:57:58,757 --> 01:58:07,560
[SPEAKER_02]: You can watch that action on our camera at www.orangeloungeradio.com What the hell has this show come to?

1441
01:58:12,662 --> 01:58:14,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, yay, I found the song I wanted to play.

1442
01:58:14,923 --> 01:58:16,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, can you see the microwave?

1443
01:58:19,005 --> 01:58:20,185
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright.

1444
01:58:20,592 --> 01:58:21,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you going to do that during the break?

1445
01:58:22,152 --> 01:58:23,093
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing that right now.

1446
01:58:23,113 --> 01:58:23,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, he's doing it right now.

1447
01:58:24,353 --> 01:58:25,613
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're pushing the button.

1448
01:58:25,633 --> 01:58:29,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Jesus Christ.

1449
01:58:29,714 --> 01:58:30,194
[SPEAKER_02]: No peep.

1450
01:58:32,614 --> 01:58:34,295
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't even see inside the microwave.

1451
01:58:34,335 --> 01:58:34,995
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all blurry.

1452
01:58:36,495 --> 01:58:36,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you?

1453
01:58:36,955 --> 01:58:38,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I guess it's the screenshot.

1454
01:58:38,596 --> 01:58:38,956
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God.

1455
01:58:38,976 --> 01:58:39,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting big.

1456
01:58:39,936 --> 01:58:41,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1457
01:58:46,383 --> 01:58:47,084
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting big.

1458
01:58:47,184 --> 01:58:49,345
[SPEAKER_03]: This makes for wonderful radio.

1459
01:58:49,445 --> 01:58:50,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting really big.

1460
01:58:51,786 --> 01:58:53,627
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, like, very deformed.

1461
01:58:56,029 --> 01:58:57,210
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we're done.

1462
01:58:59,491 --> 01:59:02,233
[SPEAKER_02]: I will never ask you people to fill time ever again.

1463
01:59:02,293 --> 01:59:03,013
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God!

1464
01:59:03,473 --> 01:59:04,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I can see on the webcam.

1465
01:59:04,894 --> 01:59:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a big... It looks like our microwave has cancer.

1466
01:59:08,056 --> 01:59:08,857
[SPEAKER_02]: That's horrible.

1467
01:59:08,877 --> 01:59:09,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.

1468
01:59:10,638 --> 01:59:10,998
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1469
01:59:12,179 --> 01:59:12,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1470
01:59:12,579 --> 01:59:13,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to go to break.

1471
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, Nellie, we'll eat it.

1472
01:59:17,362 --> 01:59:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

1473
01:59:44,938 --> 01:59:46,240
[SPEAKER_16]: Turn the table!

1474
01:59:46,801 --> 01:59:47,582
[SPEAKER_17]: You get it?

1475
01:59:47,963 --> 01:59:49,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, let's practice!

1476
01:59:50,947 --> 01:59:52,950
[SPEAKER_16]: First, hit the white keys!

1477
02:00:19,454 --> 02:00:19,774
[SPEAKER_17]: Easy, huh?

1478
02:00:19,814 --> 02:00:21,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, let's go on to the scratch day.

1479
02:00:41,670 --> 02:00:45,551
[SPEAKER_17]: With the fast notes, the technique is to scratch fast.

1480
02:00:45,571 --> 02:00:48,752
[SPEAKER_16]: Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

1481
02:00:48,832 --> 02:00:52,254
[SPEAKER_16]: It's hard, but you can do it.

1482
02:01:54,260 --> 02:01:55,281
[SPEAKER_17]: Remix Remix Remix

1483
02:02:32,160 --> 02:02:32,666
[SPEAKER_14]: Remix

1484
02:03:26,591 --> 02:03:31,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?

1485
02:03:31,733 --> 02:03:40,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this time the chicken man, it wants your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him, oh Don't, what am I gonna do?

1486
02:03:40,156 --> 02:03:41,357
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't, what am I gonna do?

1487
02:03:43,071 --> 02:03:46,514
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen a cool game like this.

1488
02:05:10,243 --> 02:05:13,507
[SPEAKER_12]: Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.

1489
02:05:14,068 --> 02:05:14,869
[SPEAKER_12]: Orange Lounge Radio

1490
02:05:17,765 --> 02:05:19,465
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1491
02:05:19,505 --> 02:05:20,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Hope you enjoyed that break.

1492
02:05:20,986 --> 02:05:23,066
[SPEAKER_02]: Emotion was the last song you heard before that.

1493
02:05:23,686 --> 02:05:25,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear remix there.

1494
02:05:26,107 --> 02:05:32,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And starting that set off was Instant Love, also known as the tutorial song from Beatmania, which, who doesn't love that song?

1495
02:05:32,748 --> 02:05:33,908
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Konami is the man.

1496
02:05:34,508 --> 02:05:35,069
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

1497
02:05:36,229 --> 02:05:38,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so how did the microwave peep turn out in the end?

1498
02:05:39,169 --> 02:05:41,770
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed the webcam was constantly being updated there during break.

1499
02:05:41,810 --> 02:05:43,490
[SPEAKER_02]: I put some random things up on cam as well.

1500
02:05:43,910 --> 02:05:44,430
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd that go?

1501
02:05:44,751 --> 02:05:46,831
[SPEAKER_02]: I turned it into an OLR logo.

1502
02:05:48,926 --> 02:05:50,267
[SPEAKER_02]: You are very strange.

1503
02:05:51,448 --> 02:05:52,089
[SPEAKER_02]: All I have to say.

1504
02:05:54,011 --> 02:05:58,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, www.orangeonstrater.com Oh my god, it does say OLR.

1505
02:06:00,997 --> 02:06:02,899
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope somebody's saving pics tonight.

1506
02:06:03,059 --> 02:06:03,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I have to say.

1507
02:06:05,161 --> 02:06:08,284
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to open up the Skype line again real quick.

1508
02:06:08,304 --> 02:06:09,405
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll give you guys a little window.

1509
02:06:09,465 --> 02:06:10,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if anybody's trying to get in.

1510
02:06:11,486 --> 02:06:13,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys do want to call in, say hello.

1511
02:06:14,085 --> 02:06:17,047
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangeonstrater.com Click on interact with us.

1512
02:06:17,467 --> 02:06:20,449
[SPEAKER_02]: I notice a lot of our regular callers are not here tonight.

1513
02:06:20,469 --> 02:06:22,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Zaku, he's nowhere to be seen tonight.

1514
02:06:22,450 --> 02:06:23,531
[SPEAKER_02]: He's usually the first one in.

1515
02:06:24,331 --> 02:06:25,252
[SPEAKER_02]: Nowhere to be seen tonight.

1516
02:06:26,512 --> 02:06:30,935
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are a noob and you want to talk to us, now's a good chance to get in.

1517
02:06:32,210 --> 02:06:32,671
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronma S, Actdeft

1518
02:06:50,987 --> 02:06:51,908
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty good.

1519
02:06:51,928 --> 02:06:53,929
[SPEAKER_02]: I have another picture for you.

1520
02:06:54,489 --> 02:06:57,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the, uh, the, um, uh, Altercade kicking.

1521
02:06:57,872 --> 02:06:59,052
[SPEAKER_02]: Mm-hmm.

1522
02:06:59,232 --> 02:07:01,254
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you post the link one more time in the chatroom?

1523
02:07:01,294 --> 02:07:04,756
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't get a chance to look at it because I was busy queuing up that particular break.

1524
02:07:05,376 --> 02:07:06,417
[SPEAKER_24]: Sure, no problem.

1525
02:07:06,437 --> 02:07:07,658
[SPEAKER_24]: Let me scroll back up here.

1526
02:07:10,085 --> 02:07:10,605
[SPEAKER_24]: Here we go.

1527
02:07:11,045 --> 02:07:12,126
[SPEAKER_02]: The wonders of the internet.

1528
02:07:12,166 --> 02:07:14,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I can actually hear the click, click, click, click.

1529
02:07:15,306 --> 02:07:17,827
[SPEAKER_02]: As you're scrolling up there.

1530
02:07:17,847 --> 02:07:18,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay!

1531
02:07:18,487 --> 02:07:20,328
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear Jamie cheering, so it must be a good picture.

1532
02:07:20,868 --> 02:07:21,648
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's that one.

1533
02:07:22,328 --> 02:07:24,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'd seen that one previously.

1534
02:07:24,549 --> 02:07:25,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the one you showed me on Thursday?

1535
02:07:26,669 --> 02:07:27,690
[SPEAKER_27]: Didn't you show me one on Thursday?

1536
02:07:27,750 --> 02:07:28,210
[SPEAKER_27]: I don't remember.

1537
02:07:28,230 --> 02:07:30,570
[SPEAKER_24]: I think those were ones from last week.

1538
02:07:30,590 --> 02:07:31,471
[SPEAKER_24]: Okay, last week.

1539
02:07:33,051 --> 02:07:35,932
[SPEAKER_24]: And we went out... Are those the only two?

1540
02:07:35,952 --> 02:07:37,192
[SPEAKER_24]: I thought you had a new one.

1541
02:07:38,058 --> 02:07:38,579
[SPEAKER_24]: I do, I do.

1542
02:07:38,599 --> 02:07:39,860
[SPEAKER_24]: I'm about to get the link to that right now.

1543
02:07:39,900 --> 02:07:40,181
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

1544
02:07:40,261 --> 02:07:40,921
[SPEAKER_02]: I want that one.

1545
02:07:41,022 --> 02:07:41,682
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me the new one.

1546
02:07:42,844 --> 02:07:43,324
[SPEAKER_24]: There you go.

1547
02:07:43,645 --> 02:07:44,406
[SPEAKER_02]: Yay, okay.

1548
02:07:44,906 --> 02:07:45,227
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes.

1549
02:07:46,148 --> 02:07:46,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, it's big.

1550
02:07:47,129 --> 02:07:48,290
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a new picture.

1551
02:07:49,031 --> 02:07:50,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd seen those two previous ones.

1552
02:07:50,593 --> 02:07:53,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he's posting these in our chat room at www.wipontryo.com.

1553
02:07:53,556 --> 02:07:54,498
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, a monitor kick.

1554
02:07:58,800 --> 02:07:59,620
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1555
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:03,361
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that guy behind you playing DDR?

1556
02:08:04,041 --> 02:08:05,822
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I have a little story about that.

1557
02:08:06,182 --> 02:08:11,784
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy behind you playing DDR looks like he is in a shower or something.

1558
02:08:12,004 --> 02:08:14,304
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my God, he's covered in sweat.

1559
02:08:14,824 --> 02:08:16,245
[SPEAKER_24]: Doubles heavy.

1560
02:08:16,525 --> 02:08:17,305
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a sweaty man.

1561
02:08:17,765 --> 02:08:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: What's up with that?

1562
02:08:19,406 --> 02:08:20,406
[SPEAKER_24]: He was playing doubles heavy.

1563
02:08:21,458 --> 02:08:24,661
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't see two sets of arrows there.

1564
02:08:24,701 --> 02:08:26,522
[SPEAKER_02]: He was playing, but he's not playing it in the picture.

1565
02:08:26,702 --> 02:08:26,962
[SPEAKER_24]: Oh, no.

1566
02:08:26,982 --> 02:08:27,302
[SPEAKER_24]: There it is.

1567
02:08:47,165 --> 02:08:48,225
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the way to do it.

1568
02:08:48,425 --> 02:08:55,628
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, remember that little kid we scared off from a golf line one time because he was making fun of us and didn't I challenge him to a duel or something and he ran away?

1569
02:08:55,648 --> 02:09:07,131
[SPEAKER_08]: There was one time where I had these guys hanging around and they were talking all kinds of shit so I said, okay, I'll pay for you to play if you really think that it's that stupid, but I pick the song.

1570
02:09:09,472 --> 02:09:09,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.

1571
02:09:11,303 --> 02:09:12,584
[SPEAKER_08]: I had them thrown out later that night.

1572
02:09:14,366 --> 02:09:18,749
[SPEAKER_02]: So after you kicked the Ultra Kade machine, you had to go kick these guys a little bit.

1573
02:09:19,530 --> 02:09:24,294
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, and for the first time in my life, I double A'd all four songs right in front of them.

1574
02:09:25,274 --> 02:09:26,195
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, very nice.

1575
02:09:26,275 --> 02:09:30,338
[SPEAKER_02]: It's those moments of pressure when you start doing really well at DDR, huh?

1576
02:09:30,859 --> 02:09:31,219
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

1577
02:09:31,339 --> 02:09:32,000
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1578
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Congratulations, my friend.

1579
02:09:33,221 --> 02:09:33,481
Thanks.

1580
02:09:34,122 --> 02:09:37,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and, um... And I noticed, I just want to point out the arcade area.

1581
02:09:37,344 --> 02:09:42,467
[SPEAKER_02]: The Altercade machine is right next to the DDR machine, which I think is a very interesting setup there.

1582
02:09:42,807 --> 02:09:45,108
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, I'm sorry, your thought?

1583
02:09:45,829 --> 02:09:50,691
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah, um, if anyone hasn't gotten it yet, the PSP is coming out on Thursday.

1584
02:09:51,032 --> 02:09:51,672
[SPEAKER_24]: Best Buy...

1585
02:09:52,543 --> 02:09:54,945
[SPEAKER_24]: You can go right to Best Buy and pick it up at 8 o'clock in the morning.

1586
02:09:54,965 --> 02:09:55,546
[SPEAKER_24]: No reserves.

1587
02:09:55,686 --> 02:09:57,148
[SPEAKER_24]: First come, first serve.

1588
02:09:57,328 --> 02:10:01,992
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were a lazy bum and didn't pre-order it like myself, that's probably going to be your only option.

1589
02:10:02,032 --> 02:10:04,635
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is exactly what I had to do with the DS, because I'm a lazy bum.

1590
02:10:04,815 --> 02:10:10,380
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, to counter that, you could just pre-order it at GameStop, have somebody call you the day before and pick it up at your convenience.

1591
02:10:11,481 --> 02:10:12,022
[SPEAKER_24]: Even better.

1592
02:10:12,763 --> 02:10:13,083
[SPEAKER_24]: You could.

1593
02:10:13,923 --> 02:10:37,189
[SPEAKER_02]: or you can have a fiance that works at GameStop and bring it home exactly and he could be all bitch bring it home because it's going to be or I ain't putting out I ain't putting out and my Final Fantasy XI Atlas I want to I totally want a Final Fantasy XI Atlas but then again I don't I quit that game I quit that game Rob I quit that game anyway any other thoughts Ranma before I let you go

1594
02:10:38,880 --> 02:10:40,560
[SPEAKER_24]: One of my new friends is listening tonight.

1595
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:41,941
[SPEAKER_24]: I just want to say, hi, Liz.

1596
02:10:42,301 --> 02:10:42,601
[SPEAKER_24]: That's it.

1597
02:10:42,901 --> 02:10:43,462
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Liz.

[SPEAKER_24]: I love Britney Spears.

1602
02:10:48,244 --> 02:10:48,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Carson.

1603
02:10:49,264 --> 02:10:50,225
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay me some Britney Spears.

1604
02:10:50,245 --> 02:10:52,125
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to give a shout out to Liz.

1605
02:10:52,145 --> 02:10:52,806
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Liz.

1606
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:57,128
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm going to do my special impersonation just for your friend.

1607
02:10:57,288 --> 02:10:57,608
[SPEAKER_26]: Okay.

1608
02:11:00,789 --> 02:11:01,350
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you.

02:11:01,910 --> 02:11:02,650
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys rock.

02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:03,430
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

02:11:03,450 --> 02:11:03,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

02:11:04,031 --> 02:11:04,891
[SPEAKER_02]: You rock for calling.

1613
02:11:04,931 --> 02:11:05,391
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

1614
02:11:05,792 --> 02:11:06,092
[SPEAKER_02]: You too.

1615
02:11:06,292 --> 02:11:06,452
[SPEAKER_02]: Bye.

1616
02:11:07,717 --> 02:11:09,559
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a ferret before I pick up the next call?

1617
02:11:09,579 --> 02:11:10,680
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a ferret beep for Liz?

1618
02:11:11,160 --> 02:11:12,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then I've got to get to the next call.

1619
02:11:13,662 --> 02:11:14,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Really quick.

1620
02:11:15,183 --> 02:11:15,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, really quick.

1621
02:11:16,004 --> 02:11:17,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I'm getting to this next call.

1622
02:11:17,145 --> 02:11:17,806
[SPEAKER_02]: Ferret for Liz.

1623
02:11:19,867 --> 02:11:20,148
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello?

1624
02:11:20,868 --> 02:11:21,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1625
02:11:21,549 --> 02:11:22,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, hi.

02:11:22,189 --> 02:11:23,430
[SPEAKER_02]: You are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1627
02:11:23,470 --> 02:11:23,831
[SPEAKER_02]: Who this?

1628
02:11:24,731 --> 02:11:26,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

1629
02:11:26,513 --> 02:11:27,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt.

1630
02:11:27,914 --> 02:11:28,855
[SPEAKER_02]: What is on your mind, my friend?

1631
02:11:29,575 --> 02:11:29,876
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing.

1632
02:11:29,896 --> 02:11:36,021
[SPEAKER_19]: I just want to say, I just want to apologize to DarkSakura about the little argument in the chat room earlier.

1633
02:11:36,491 --> 02:11:36,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1634
02:11:37,051 --> 02:11:38,632
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, apology accepted, thank you.

1635
02:11:39,053 --> 02:11:39,413
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1636
02:11:39,853 --> 02:11:42,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, aww, aww, I love moments.

1637
02:11:42,695 --> 02:11:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I love moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1638
02:11:46,657 --> 02:11:49,899
[SPEAKER_19]: See, I'm nice, I'm nice, I'm not a bad guy.

1639
02:11:50,220 --> 02:11:53,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody said you weren't a nice guy, it's just you might have some typing issues.

1640
02:11:53,281 --> 02:11:54,222
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.

1641
02:11:55,243 --> 02:11:57,944
[SPEAKER_02]: I get criticized for my pronunciation.

1642
02:11:57,964 --> 02:12:00,246
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't even pronounce pronunciation.

1643
02:12:01,086 --> 02:12:04,909
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, when I was four, I glued my fingers together, so, you know.

1644
02:12:05,149 --> 02:12:05,409
Okay.

1645
02:12:06,952 --> 02:12:07,452
[SPEAKER_19]: It happens.

1646
02:12:08,212 --> 02:12:08,733
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

1647
02:12:08,933 --> 02:12:11,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on 2DX Nightstyle or any of the new stuff coming out?

1648
02:12:13,314 --> 02:12:14,355
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't really know what that is.

1649
02:12:14,775 --> 02:12:15,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's alright.

1650
02:12:15,655 --> 02:12:16,655
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove, you know that one?

1651
02:12:17,376 --> 02:12:22,077
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, well, you know, my arcade kind of has it, except they don't, but you know.

1652
02:12:22,537 --> 02:12:29,680
[SPEAKER_19]: They've had like the whole box and everything for it, but they still have DDR4th Mix.

1653
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:32,721
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Groove cabinet they have DDR4th Mix?

1654
02:12:32,741 --> 02:12:32,801
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

1655
02:12:33,214 --> 02:12:34,915
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, they've had it in there for like about two weeks.

1656
02:12:34,955 --> 02:12:36,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that is ironic.

1657
02:12:36,716 --> 02:12:42,420
[SPEAKER_02]: When you consider that In the Groove is kind of a stowaway game, and you always see In the Groove and DDR cabinets, that is great.

1658
02:12:42,520 --> 02:12:43,641
[SPEAKER_08]: That sounds like an upgrade.

1659
02:12:43,881 --> 02:12:46,303
[SPEAKER_08]: That's... It is an upgrade.

1660
02:12:46,543 --> 02:12:47,524
[SPEAKER_19]: I agree with you on that.

1661
02:12:49,245 --> 02:12:49,545
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

1662
02:12:50,046 --> 02:12:50,366
[SPEAKER_02]: Very nice.

1663
02:12:50,446 --> 02:12:51,286
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss 4th Mix.

1664
02:12:51,607 --> 02:12:52,707
[SPEAKER_02]: 4th Mix was such a wonderful mix.

1665
02:12:53,748 --> 02:12:55,369
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it 4th Plus or 4th Mix?

1666
02:12:56,330 --> 02:12:56,670
[SPEAKER_19]: 4th Plus.

1667
02:12:57,070 --> 02:12:58,371
[SPEAKER_02]: Play some conga feeling for me.

1668
02:12:59,412 --> 02:13:01,113
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we don't have 4th Plus here anymore.

1669
02:13:02,194 --> 02:13:02,474
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1670
02:13:03,095 --> 02:13:03,855
[SPEAKER_02]: He's like, no way.

1671
02:13:04,356 --> 02:13:04,696
[SPEAKER_02]: No way.

1672
02:13:05,236 --> 02:13:05,917
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, try it.

1673
02:13:05,937 --> 02:13:07,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, play some Rhythm and Police.

1674
02:13:08,678 --> 02:13:09,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhythm and Police is cool.

1675
02:13:09,759 --> 02:13:12,220
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, any other thoughts, SSJ, before I let you go?

1676
02:13:13,801 --> 02:13:19,224
[SPEAKER_19]: Not really, just a little excited about the anime convention in Arizona that's coming this week.

1677
02:13:19,984 --> 02:13:20,405
[SPEAKER_02]: What city?

1678
02:13:21,105 --> 02:13:21,405
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix.

1679
02:13:22,206 --> 02:13:23,486
[SPEAKER_02]: Phoenix, all right, right on.

1680
02:13:24,027 --> 02:13:24,747
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the name of it?

1681
02:13:26,670 --> 02:13:28,271
[SPEAKER_19]: and Arizona, Anniezona.

1682
02:13:28,592 --> 02:13:28,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1683
02:13:29,352 --> 02:13:31,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like Arizona, but Anniezona.

1684
02:13:31,574 --> 02:13:31,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

1685
02:13:31,995 --> 02:13:32,395
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cute.

1686
02:13:32,455 --> 02:13:32,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1687
02:13:33,256 --> 02:13:36,478
[SPEAKER_19]: And the guest of honor is Yoshitaka Mano.

1688
02:13:36,999 --> 02:13:37,359
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

1689
02:13:37,739 --> 02:13:38,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to Arizona.

1690
02:13:40,522 --> 02:13:40,982
[SPEAKER_05]: Bye, y'all.

1691
02:13:41,463 --> 02:13:41,983
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really?

1692
02:13:42,544 --> 02:13:42,684
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1693
02:13:43,224 --> 02:13:43,805
[SPEAKER_05]: But I would.

1694
02:13:43,965 --> 02:13:44,545
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God.

1695
02:13:44,585 --> 02:13:45,266
[SPEAKER_05]: He's like my favorite artist.

1696
02:13:45,346 --> 02:13:46,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Our webmaster lives in Arizona.

1697
02:13:46,847 --> 02:13:48,228
[SPEAKER_02]: I bet you he might be checking that out.

1698
02:13:48,529 --> 02:13:51,431
[SPEAKER_05]: Jason has to go talk to my hero for me.

1699
02:13:51,591 --> 02:13:53,773
[SPEAKER_02]: Jason's not listening tonight, which is kind of weird.

1700
02:13:53,813 --> 02:13:54,373
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn him.

1701
02:13:54,634 --> 02:13:54,854
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

1702
02:13:56,267 --> 02:13:59,370
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to meet my artistic hero.

1703
02:13:59,510 --> 02:14:00,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Have fun at the convention.

1704
02:14:00,531 --> 02:14:03,893
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had money, we would go too, but unfortunately we're poor.

1705
02:14:03,913 --> 02:14:07,476
[SPEAKER_19]: Maybe I'll get an autograph for Sakura as a peace offering.

1706
02:14:07,496 --> 02:14:09,377
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so nice of you.

1707
02:14:10,718 --> 02:14:12,880
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to give you both a hug.

1708
02:14:12,980 --> 02:14:14,922
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll stop provoking you.

1709
02:14:15,782 --> 02:14:16,583
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, buddy.

1710
02:14:16,603 --> 02:14:17,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for calling in.

1711
02:14:17,364 --> 02:14:18,484
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very big of you.

1712
02:14:18,665 --> 02:14:20,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.

1713
02:14:20,126 --> 02:14:20,326
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

1714
02:14:23,326 --> 02:14:27,029
[SPEAKER_02]: Aw, I'm just feeling, I feel fuzzy wuzzy and I feel sick.

1715
02:14:28,310 --> 02:14:28,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob?

1716
02:14:28,990 --> 02:14:29,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

1717
02:14:31,512 --> 02:14:32,312
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that was fun.

1718
02:14:36,235 --> 02:14:38,216
[SPEAKER_02]: A lovely Skype segment tonight.

1719
02:14:38,496 --> 02:14:39,437
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't complain about that one.

1720
02:14:40,846 --> 02:14:43,447
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to go to a break, but then I realized we just had a break.

1721
02:14:43,487 --> 02:14:44,127
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't do that.

1722
02:14:44,207 --> 02:14:47,488
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to take a break from breaks.

1723
02:14:47,868 --> 02:14:50,808
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get into the FUs of the week is what we need to do, dammit.

1724
02:14:50,888 --> 02:14:52,489
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not angry anymore!

1725
02:14:52,649 --> 02:14:54,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is exactly why we need to do it now.

1726
02:15:00,211 --> 02:15:01,871
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, something did piss me off a lot today.

1727
02:15:02,267 --> 02:15:04,149
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, why do we do this every single week?

1728
02:15:35,408 --> 02:15:36,449
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, this is bad.

1729
02:15:37,229 --> 02:15:38,890
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is justice.

1730
02:15:38,970 --> 02:15:41,111
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is punishment.

1731
02:15:41,171 --> 02:15:43,932
[SPEAKER_15]: Here is... This is fucked up.

1732
02:15:44,892 --> 02:15:49,334
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to, uh... Okay, I have to explain this.

1733
02:15:49,414 --> 02:15:53,696
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody knows that I have this thing about old people who drive really, really slow.

1734
02:15:54,356 --> 02:15:57,138
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I have this thing about people who talk on their cell phones while they drive.

1735
02:15:58,038 --> 02:16:00,019
[SPEAKER_08]: I had the ultimate in piss off today.

1736
02:16:00,619 --> 02:16:04,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I was stuck behind this old guy talking on his cell phone.

1737
02:16:06,219 --> 02:16:13,041
[SPEAKER_08]: He was all veiny and ancient and was leaning over the steering wheel, you know that type?

1738
02:16:13,841 --> 02:16:15,742
[SPEAKER_08]: And then talking on his damn cell phone.

1739
02:16:16,002 --> 02:16:17,382
[SPEAKER_18]: Veiny and ancient.

1740
02:16:18,523 --> 02:16:22,524
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what I mean, when people get really old that you can feel their veins.

1741
02:16:25,465 --> 02:16:26,925
[SPEAKER_08]: His wife was in the car with him.

1742
02:16:28,946 --> 02:16:30,566
[SPEAKER_08]: They didn't look like they were having a hard time.

1743
02:16:31,317 --> 02:16:32,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone was having a heart attack.

1744
02:16:33,099 --> 02:16:35,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Billy, how did you get trapped in the phone?

1745
02:16:37,242 --> 02:16:40,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, I just passed him and cut him off and that was good.

1746
02:16:41,245 --> 02:16:42,566
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that make you feel better?

1747
02:16:42,586 --> 02:16:43,267
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it did.

1748
02:16:43,287 --> 02:16:45,729
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't really cut him off, but yeah.

1749
02:16:45,909 --> 02:16:56,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Another FU goes toward our lovely president, fucking asshole, for bringing Senate to vote about that lady in Florida.

1750
02:16:58,288 --> 02:17:05,254
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, this is a lady who had been brain dead for 15 years, getting no oxygen to her brain.

1751
02:17:05,634 --> 02:17:06,655
[SPEAKER_08]: She was a vegetable.

1752
02:17:06,695 --> 02:17:07,755
[SPEAKER_08]: She still is a vegetable.

1753
02:17:07,816 --> 02:17:10,898
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be anything but a living vegetable.

1754
02:17:11,518 --> 02:17:14,301
[SPEAKER_08]: And so they got authorization to take the feeding tube out finally.

1755
02:17:14,841 --> 02:17:23,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And Senate is, you know, they have other things they could be voting on, like, you know, allotting more money toward, you know, useful things.

1756
02:17:24,526 --> 02:17:28,669
[SPEAKER_08]: or, you know, improvement of our social systems.

1757
02:17:29,090 --> 02:17:35,514
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, they're voting on whether or not to let basically a corpse on life support actually be a real corpse.

1758
02:17:36,915 --> 02:17:43,420
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead, you know, they're costing this family all of these doctor bills just because of this whole right to die issue.

1759
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:44,821
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not there anymore.

1760
02:17:44,961 --> 02:17:46,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, no one home.

1761
02:17:46,622 --> 02:17:47,243
[SPEAKER_08]: Let her go.

1762
02:17:48,324 --> 02:17:51,066
[SPEAKER_03]: But, Jamie, we can rebuild them.

1763
02:17:51,666 --> 02:17:52,867
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the technology.

1764
02:17:54,255 --> 02:17:56,456
[SPEAKER_02]: We could put Walt Disney's brain in there.

1765
02:17:56,576 --> 02:17:56,677
[SPEAKER_02]: E.T.

1766
02:17:56,697 --> 02:17:57,757
[SPEAKER_08]: phoned home already.

1767
02:17:58,698 --> 02:18:06,683
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're left with is to... Actually, she's probably more intelligent than him right now, but... I say... You know what?

1768
02:18:06,803 --> 02:18:08,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I say we elect this lady president.

1769
02:18:09,004 --> 02:18:09,584
[SPEAKER_09]: She'd do a better job.

1770
02:18:09,604 --> 02:18:10,725
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm scared about?

1771
02:18:10,805 --> 02:18:12,846
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that we have living dead.

1772
02:18:12,866 --> 02:18:15,108
[SPEAKER_09]: We do.

1773
02:18:15,188 --> 02:18:16,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop cultivating zombies.

1774
02:18:16,268 --> 02:18:17,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know she's going to get out of the bed.

1775
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:19,670
[SPEAKER_03]: Brains.

1776
02:18:20,151 --> 02:18:20,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Brains.

1777
02:18:20,931 --> 02:18:21,772
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be brain dead.

1778
02:18:21,832 --> 02:18:23,032
[SPEAKER_03]: She needs brains.

1779
02:18:23,473 --> 02:18:23,653
[SPEAKER_06]: With...

1780
02:18:24,281 --> 02:18:31,284
[SPEAKER_06]: You see, you see... This woman is starving to death for 14 days, and you're like, BRAIN!

1781
02:18:31,364 --> 02:18:33,045
[SPEAKER_06]: Let you guys starve to death!

1782
02:18:33,145 --> 02:18:36,087
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's what we need, a brain-dead person starving for brains!

1783
02:18:36,487 --> 02:18:39,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, my F you, so fuck you, shut up!

1784
02:18:40,489 --> 02:18:42,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay?

1785
02:18:42,690 --> 02:18:45,991
[SPEAKER_08]: She does not know that she's starving.

1786
02:18:46,131 --> 02:18:49,473
[SPEAKER_08]: She doesn't have the capacity to register pain.

1787
02:18:52,768 --> 02:18:57,451
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's going to be one of those...

1788
02:19:17,719 --> 02:19:19,200
[SPEAKER_25]: Lethal Injection.

1789
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:20,800
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay?

1790
02:19:21,060 --> 02:19:23,441
[SPEAKER_25]: If you're going to kill her, do it quickly.

1791
02:19:23,742 --> 02:19:29,424
[SPEAKER_25]: Don't leave her to wither and starve and die away slowly.

1792
02:19:32,926 --> 02:19:43,310
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly, I would prefer Lethal Injection, but if they have to do anything, you know, the only legal recourse they have is to take the tube out and let her die of natural causes.

1793
02:19:44,113 --> 02:19:44,453
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura,

1794
02:20:14,514 --> 02:20:17,096
[SPEAKER_08]: There is no mind or soul left in her body.

1795
02:20:17,476 --> 02:20:18,417
[SPEAKER_08]: It has departed.

1796
02:20:20,839 --> 02:20:21,339
[SPEAKER_08]: It's back.

1797
02:20:21,399 --> 02:20:22,060
[SPEAKER_08]: There's nothing there.

1798
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:26,964
[SPEAKER_08]: She cannot maintain the cognitive functions of the average human being.

1799
02:20:27,004 --> 02:20:27,644
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll put it that way.

1800
02:20:27,664 --> 02:20:29,546
[SPEAKER_08]: She has no cognitive functions.

1801
02:20:30,867 --> 02:20:31,367
[SPEAKER_08]: End of story.

1802
02:20:32,288 --> 02:20:36,131
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, I would say that if they could just go ahead and kill her.

1803
02:20:37,941 --> 02:20:41,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say if they could legally get away with just injecting her and killing her, do it.

1804
02:20:41,466 --> 02:20:44,291
[SPEAKER_08]: I would encourage somebody to go sneak into that hospital and do it.

1805
02:20:44,391 --> 02:20:44,871
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

1806
02:20:46,346 --> 02:20:50,347
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be one of those ironic things where they're going to have this whole battle.

1807
02:20:50,387 --> 02:20:53,749
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like that movie, what is it, Citizen Ruth?

1808
02:20:53,849 --> 02:20:54,649
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like that movie.

1809
02:20:54,709 --> 02:20:55,669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big abortion.

1810
02:20:55,929 --> 02:20:57,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Should she or should she not have an abortion?

1811
02:20:58,050 --> 02:20:59,511
[SPEAKER_02]: And then at the end, she miscarries.

1812
02:20:59,931 --> 02:21:03,532
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be one of those types of things where she's going to end up... She's going to wake up.

1813
02:21:03,712 --> 02:21:08,093
[SPEAKER_02]: She's going to roll and fall out of her bed and kill herself that way or something.

1814
02:21:08,394 --> 02:21:10,294
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be one of those really tragic things.

1815
02:21:10,334 --> 02:21:12,815
[SPEAKER_02]: After this big, huge fight, something else will happen.

1816
02:21:13,735 --> 02:21:14,556
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my prediction.

1817
02:21:14,576 --> 02:21:15,176
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here first.

1818
02:21:15,236 --> 02:21:15,636
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate...

1819
02:21:17,066 --> 02:21:26,711
[SPEAKER_08]: One way or another, her husband should not be made to suffer watching this joke of his wife be kept on life support.

1820
02:21:27,031 --> 02:21:27,951
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no reason for it.

1821
02:21:29,412 --> 02:21:31,213
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel really bad for him.

1822
02:21:31,473 --> 02:21:34,455
[SPEAKER_08]: And then her family, her parents are holding on to false hopes.

1823
02:21:34,475 --> 02:21:37,136
[SPEAKER_08]: She's not waking up.

1824
02:21:37,236 --> 02:21:39,177
[SPEAKER_08]: If they truly loved her, they would let her go.

1825
02:21:42,426 --> 02:21:43,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I agree with that.

1826
02:21:44,888 --> 02:21:47,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's end on an agreement, please.

1827
02:21:48,370 --> 02:21:49,951
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs to die one way or another.

1828
02:21:49,971 --> 02:21:51,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Please, let's end on an agreement.

1829
02:21:51,733 --> 02:21:54,775
[SPEAKER_08]: She needs to be killed.

1830
02:21:54,855 --> 02:21:56,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other FUs, Jamie?

1831
02:21:56,076 --> 02:21:56,556
[SPEAKER_08]: Break her neck.

1832
02:21:59,478 --> 02:22:00,939
[SPEAKER_08]: What rules does this have?

1833
02:22:02,920 --> 02:22:04,442
[SPEAKER_08]: I say we give her the log treatment.

1834
02:22:04,842 --> 02:22:05,482
[SPEAKER_09]: No, that's bad.

1835
02:22:06,243 --> 02:22:06,943
[SPEAKER_08]: No, seriously.

1836
02:22:07,304 --> 02:22:08,785
[SPEAKER_08]: My other FUs, I really don't have any.

1837
02:22:09,745 --> 02:22:11,567
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just really been sort of my inferiority.

1838
02:22:11,667 --> 02:22:12,047
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah?

1839
02:22:12,742 --> 02:22:14,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, fuck you to the worm in Silent Hill 3.

1840
02:22:14,723 --> 02:22:16,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Ew.

1841
02:22:17,085 --> 02:22:17,405
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm done.

1842
02:22:17,945 --> 02:22:18,206
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

1843
02:22:18,426 --> 02:22:21,468
[SPEAKER_25]: Okay, afterthought, revive Jeffrey Dahmer, have him go at it.

1844
02:22:21,808 --> 02:22:23,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, you guys are weird.

1845
02:22:23,629 --> 02:22:24,410
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's go.

1846
02:22:25,270 --> 02:22:27,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, let's go to Loki.

1847
02:22:29,733 --> 02:22:33,596
[SPEAKER_02]: Just don't acknowledge that with a comment on air, please, I beg you.

1848
02:22:33,676 --> 02:22:36,117
[SPEAKER_03]: All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this, where is this at?

1849
02:22:36,137 --> 02:22:37,238
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Florida, right?

1850
02:22:38,683 --> 02:22:39,043
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

1851
02:22:57,393 --> 02:23:02,075
[SPEAKER_02]: 100,000 people died in a tsunami in January, and we are all hung up on this chick.

1852
02:23:02,155 --> 02:23:05,156
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but did any of them turn into zombies?

1853
02:23:05,536 --> 02:23:06,416
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

1854
02:23:06,496 --> 02:23:07,256
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

1855
02:23:07,917 --> 02:23:15,739
[SPEAKER_08]: At any rate, at any rate, you know, the body, true, it can live without cognitive function, but that doesn't necessarily constitute life.

1856
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:18,500
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's going to happen?

1857
02:23:18,520 --> 02:23:19,920
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to pull out that goddamn tube.

1858
02:23:19,960 --> 02:23:21,681
[SPEAKER_03]: She's going to go, breathe!

1859
02:23:21,941 --> 02:23:22,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And it starts there.

1860
02:23:23,241 --> 02:23:25,622
[SPEAKER_02]: I seriously cannot take this topic anymore, please.

1861
02:23:26,935 --> 02:23:31,018
[SPEAKER_08]: The simple point behind it is just that the Republicans are trying to one-up the Democrats.

1862
02:23:31,038 --> 02:23:31,518
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all it is.

1863
02:23:31,538 --> 02:23:33,440
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1864
02:23:34,861 --> 02:23:35,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1865
02:23:36,002 --> 02:23:36,322
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1866
02:23:37,472 --> 02:23:39,633
[SPEAKER_03]: So here's my solution to the whole problem.

1867
02:23:39,954 --> 02:23:44,736
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have America, because America can make great decisions like choosing the American Idol.

1868
02:23:45,116 --> 02:23:47,137
[SPEAKER_03]: We should have them vote on how she dies.

1869
02:23:47,577 --> 02:23:55,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, this can be anywhere from being shot out of a cannon to dropped from a plane, space shuttle, mirror, I mean, it doesn't really matter.

1870
02:23:55,301 --> 02:23:57,002
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, you know, have her die.

1871
02:23:57,042 --> 02:23:58,263
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she can't feel pain.

1872
02:23:58,523 --> 02:24:00,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, might as well contribute to society.

1873
02:24:00,904 --> 02:24:01,544
[SPEAKER_03]: She cannot.

1874
02:24:01,564 --> 02:24:02,325
[SPEAKER_03]: She's brain dead.

1875
02:24:04,170 --> 02:24:05,430
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, I'll put it this way.

1876
02:24:05,490 --> 02:24:13,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Her nervous system can register a pain response, but her brain does not understand that she is in pain because there's nothing there.

1877
02:24:14,373 --> 02:24:18,395
[SPEAKER_03]: How about we poke her and then she goes, ow, then we'll know that she can feel pain.

1878
02:24:19,155 --> 02:24:20,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, tough, then she's not feeling pain.

1879
02:24:20,815 --> 02:24:21,476
[SPEAKER_18]: She's not there.

1880
02:24:22,596 --> 02:24:24,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's enough of that.

1881
02:24:25,237 --> 02:24:28,338
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to have a heart attack and then we're going to have to decide how we should kill ourselves.

1882
02:24:29,232 --> 02:24:30,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, he's already dead.

1883
02:24:30,433 --> 02:24:31,374
[SPEAKER_03]: He's not a zombie.

1884
02:24:31,814 --> 02:24:37,639
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob, I promise you, if ever you've had some life support with a tube in your stomach, we'll let you go.

1885
02:24:37,659 --> 02:24:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull that fucking tube out.

1886
02:24:39,320 --> 02:24:41,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be a vegetable.

1887
02:24:41,462 --> 02:24:42,703
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, you pull out.

1888
02:24:42,783 --> 02:24:43,784
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I already said this.

1889
02:24:44,577 --> 02:24:45,377
[SPEAKER_02]: I decree this.

1890
02:24:45,457 --> 02:24:53,120
[SPEAKER_02]: If I am in that state, I want you to fling... I want to be put in a catapult, and I want to be flung against a glass building.

1891
02:24:53,220 --> 02:24:54,121
[SPEAKER_09]: Flung at the White House.

1892
02:24:54,601 --> 02:24:56,422
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I want to be flung at a glass building.

1893
02:24:56,802 --> 02:24:58,543
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be flung at the Apple building.

1894
02:24:58,843 --> 02:24:59,103
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool.

1895
02:24:59,123 --> 02:24:59,903
[SPEAKER_02]: During lunch hour.

1896
02:25:00,443 --> 02:25:01,324
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be rad.

1897
02:25:01,404 --> 02:25:02,384
[SPEAKER_02]: That is my request.

1898
02:25:02,444 --> 02:25:02,804
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

1899
02:25:02,904 --> 02:25:07,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we dress you up in all matching clothes so that you can match your iPod or...

1900
02:25:08,889 --> 02:25:16,415
[SPEAKER_08]: One other thing that I do want to mention is that she had actually been witnessing that she would never want to be maintained on life support.

1901
02:25:18,877 --> 02:25:19,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1902
02:25:19,618 --> 02:25:22,800
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, Loki, that comment, oh my god.

1903
02:25:24,301 --> 02:25:25,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on this show.

1904
02:25:26,343 --> 02:25:28,085
[SPEAKER_02]: And we still don't get hate mail.

1905
02:25:28,385 --> 02:25:29,466
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the amazing thing.

1906
02:25:29,506 --> 02:25:31,307
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't get hate mail over comments like that.

1907
02:25:31,528 --> 02:25:32,648
[SPEAKER_02]: I am the voice of the people.

1908
02:25:32,869 --> 02:25:33,589
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

1909
02:25:35,131 --> 02:25:35,591
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways.

1910
02:25:36,075 --> 02:25:42,498
[SPEAKER_03]: So, further FUs of the week, go to bad drivers, especially people that don't know how to drive in rain.

1911
02:25:42,919 --> 02:25:47,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when the raindrops are big and there's pea-sized hail coming down, what do you do?

1912
02:25:47,321 --> 02:25:48,722
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to drive faster, that's right.

1913
02:25:49,162 --> 02:25:54,725
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can slip on the, you know, the water and stuff and hydroplane off a cliff or something.

1914
02:25:55,085 --> 02:25:59,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's what people do, and that's what people did today, except they didn't fall off a cliff.

1915
02:26:00,528 --> 02:26:02,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Instead, they just got in a car accident and

1916
02:26:03,857 --> 02:26:06,477
[SPEAKER_03]: and maybe you turn over a median and stuff like that.

1917
02:26:07,018 --> 02:26:07,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, people.

1918
02:26:09,438 --> 02:26:18,520
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, um, fuck you to, uh, to Necrophiliacs.

1919
02:26:19,620 --> 02:26:21,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Please move past it.

1920
02:26:22,140 --> 02:26:23,400
[SPEAKER_03]: Please move past it.

1921
02:26:23,581 --> 02:26:24,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Even dead people need lovin'.

1922
02:26:25,181 --> 02:26:30,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, uh, um, no, really though, um, am I really here?

1923
02:26:31,222 --> 02:26:31,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think

1924
02:26:32,421 --> 02:26:33,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm probably done.

1925
02:26:33,902 --> 02:26:39,246
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know the only thing that... I think she should run for governor.

1926
02:26:41,747 --> 02:26:42,388
[SPEAKER_03]: She's got a chance.

1927
02:26:45,750 --> 02:26:48,111
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm done, I think.

1928
02:26:48,952 --> 02:26:50,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't think of anything else funny.

1929
02:26:50,693 --> 02:26:51,033
[SPEAKER_03]: You're done.

1930
02:26:52,875 --> 02:26:54,916
You're done.

1931
02:26:57,197 --> 02:26:57,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1932
02:26:57,898 --> 02:27:00,820
[SPEAKER_02]: I had some good FUs of the week, but I lost it.

1933
02:27:01,020 --> 02:27:01,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1934
02:27:02,754 --> 02:27:03,935
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to disagreements.

1935
02:27:04,015 --> 02:27:05,196
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't we all just get along?

1936
02:27:05,256 --> 02:27:06,156
[SPEAKER_02]: How about a hug, you guys?

1937
02:27:06,456 --> 02:27:07,657
[SPEAKER_02]: I want a big group hug.

1938
02:27:08,137 --> 02:27:08,918
[SPEAKER_02]: Big group hug.

1939
02:27:09,498 --> 02:27:09,978
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on.

1940
02:27:12,380 --> 02:27:13,781
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just me and Angel in the hug.

1941
02:27:13,941 --> 02:27:14,941
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not feeling the hug.

1942
02:27:15,442 --> 02:27:16,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the hug, everybody?

1943
02:27:17,483 --> 02:27:18,263
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys suck.

1944
02:27:18,844 --> 02:27:20,505
[SPEAKER_26]: F you to you guys for not wanting to do a hug.

1945
02:27:22,146 --> 02:27:22,586
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

1946
02:27:23,587 --> 02:27:25,108
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have anything good to say.

1947
02:27:25,348 --> 02:27:26,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what we could do.

1948
02:27:26,368 --> 02:27:26,648
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

1949
02:27:27,289 --> 02:27:30,611
[SPEAKER_03]: We can dress her up and put her in funny situations like Bernie.

1950
02:27:31,306 --> 02:27:36,210
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be like, you know, Weekend with... Weekend with... Terry.

1951
02:27:36,370 --> 02:27:37,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Her name is Terry.

1952
02:27:37,271 --> 02:27:37,631
[SPEAKER_03]: Terry?

1953
02:27:38,031 --> 02:27:39,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Weekend with Terry.

1954
02:27:39,433 --> 02:27:41,794
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, Weekend at Terry's or something like that.

1955
02:27:41,854 --> 02:27:47,959
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, where she's just sitting there... You are... There is a special place in hell.

1956
02:27:48,279 --> 02:27:50,321
[SPEAKER_02]: They already have your name engraved on the seat.

1957
02:27:53,243 --> 02:27:53,984
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a seat?

1958
02:27:54,284 --> 02:27:55,005
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

1959
02:27:55,760 --> 02:27:56,261
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.

1960
02:27:56,721 --> 02:27:58,903
[SPEAKER_02]: We seriously need to get through this segment.

1961
02:27:59,243 --> 02:28:01,205
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on to other folks in the room.

1962
02:28:03,747 --> 02:28:05,389
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, your FUs of the week.

1963
02:28:07,671 --> 02:28:09,732
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, where to start on my FUs?

1964
02:28:10,033 --> 02:28:10,353
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh, wait.

1965
02:28:10,373 --> 02:28:11,654
[SPEAKER_25]: I wasn't supposed to bring that up.

1966
02:28:14,276 --> 02:28:18,600
[SPEAKER_25]: FU to rude callers, especially at my workplace.

1967
02:28:19,061 --> 02:28:19,861
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm here to help.

1968
02:28:20,542 --> 02:28:21,683
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not here to be berated.

1969
02:28:22,079 --> 02:28:25,381
[SPEAKER_25]: I'm not here to, hmm, have death threats directed against me.

1970
02:28:25,681 --> 02:28:26,062
[SPEAKER_25]: Get this.

1971
02:28:26,462 --> 02:28:33,467
[SPEAKER_25]: One fucker decided to actually call in a bomb threat because of Bush's medical policies.

1972
02:28:34,067 --> 02:28:35,408
[SPEAKER_25]: Because I work in healthcare.

1973
02:28:36,589 --> 02:28:37,189
[SPEAKER_25]: What the hell?

1974
02:28:37,770 --> 02:28:39,431
[SPEAKER_25]: You don't leave that kind of shit on my voicemail.

1975
02:28:39,451 --> 02:28:40,011
[SPEAKER_25]: Fuck you.

1976
02:28:42,413 --> 02:28:46,616
[SPEAKER_25]: Tech support worker is more of my bargain for, but hey, whatever.

1977
02:28:47,897 --> 02:28:48,777
[SPEAKER_25]: Ugh, let's see.

1978
02:28:49,438 --> 02:28:51,239
[SPEAKER_25]: F you to stupid drivers in the rain.

1979
02:28:53,234 --> 02:28:55,015
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, I double F you from that.

1980
02:28:55,955 --> 02:28:59,217
[SPEAKER_25]: Judging from the amount of cursing from my dad, I think he shares that F you too.

1981
02:29:01,057 --> 02:29:01,618
[SPEAKER_25]: That's about it.

1982
02:29:04,019 --> 02:29:04,359
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

1983
02:29:06,019 --> 02:29:06,279
[SPEAKER_25]: Angel!

1984
02:29:07,600 --> 02:29:15,483
[SPEAKER_10]: The F you to finals, because I had one operating system after another, because it was like back-to-back finals, and I was like, ah, brain fried, oh my god.

1985
02:29:16,424 --> 02:29:17,904
[SPEAKER_10]: But that's over, so whatever.

1986
02:29:18,824 --> 02:29:19,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Um...

1987
02:29:22,576 --> 02:29:24,438
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh, I don't know.

1988
02:29:25,159 --> 02:29:27,060
[SPEAKER_10]: Just, yeah, I don't know.

1989
02:29:27,641 --> 02:29:29,823
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what else to say after YouTube.

1990
02:29:30,003 --> 02:29:31,124
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah.

1991
02:29:31,184 --> 02:29:34,867
[SPEAKER_10]: After YouTube, I'm not playing DDR that much, because last night hurt.

1992
02:29:35,127 --> 02:29:35,267
[SPEAKER_10]: Ow.

1993
02:29:39,251 --> 02:29:46,017
[SPEAKER_10]: But, uh, yeah, that just means that I need to go to the arcade, like, once a week.

1994
02:29:46,898 --> 02:29:47,298
[SPEAKER_10]: If, uh,

1995
02:29:47,819 --> 02:29:49,901
[SPEAKER_10]: Some other people in this room would like to do that.

1996
02:29:50,121 --> 02:29:51,422
[SPEAKER_10]: So, yeah, that's it.

1997
02:29:51,522 --> 02:29:51,862
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm done.

1998
02:29:52,062 --> 02:29:52,303
[SPEAKER_10]: Bye.

1999
02:29:53,323 --> 02:29:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a hint with a capital H. I'm just messing with you.

2000
02:29:58,067 --> 02:29:58,407
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2001
02:29:59,809 --> 02:30:01,790
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chatroom FUs.

2002
02:30:05,393 --> 02:30:06,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with DarkTetsuya.

2003
02:30:07,415 --> 02:30:10,337
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to you guys going to CCL and not telling me.

2004
02:30:10,417 --> 02:30:10,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Grr.

2005
02:30:12,419 --> 02:30:14,400
[SPEAKER_02]: I will send you a private message later, DarkTetsuya.

2006
02:30:14,440 --> 02:30:15,261
[SPEAKER_02]: We're planning on going back.

2007
02:30:16,593 --> 02:30:23,576
[SPEAKER_02]: VGM says F you to GameStop and EB Games for not having metal dance pads in Florida.

2008
02:30:24,397 --> 02:30:26,017
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to me for being a noob.

2009
02:30:30,119 --> 02:30:37,122
[SPEAKER_02]: Dork says F you to my friend who constantly plays the Ding Dong song for so much that I now made it as a ringtone.

2010
02:30:37,602 --> 02:30:40,784
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now I randomly say, oh, you've touched my tra-la-la.

2011
02:30:43,593 --> 02:30:51,620
[SPEAKER_02]: AsianBuddy Paul says, F you to wisdom teeth removal, although my consolation is the pain meds that come with them.

2012
02:30:51,800 --> 02:31:00,988
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to that website for firing slash banning me.

2013
02:31:01,088 --> 02:31:01,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you hard.

2014
02:31:01,908 --> 02:31:03,970
[SPEAKER_02]: For everything I did, this is the thanks I get.

2015
02:31:04,210 --> 02:31:04,971
[SPEAKER_02]: F you royally.

2016
02:31:06,937 --> 02:31:10,060
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says, F you to suddenly being sick out of nowhere.

2017
02:31:10,540 --> 02:31:12,602
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the alleged song list for Donkey Konga 2.

2018
02:31:13,342 --> 02:31:16,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Story of the Year, Good Charlotte, and Taking Back Sunday.

2019
02:31:16,705 --> 02:31:19,828
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you trying to make the Donkey Konga players of America retarded?

2020
02:31:20,689 --> 02:31:23,991
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to this weekend being absolutely boring, being too sick to go anywhere.

2021
02:31:24,332 --> 02:31:27,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning I had to stay at home, sit around, and be completely bored.

2022
02:31:29,696 --> 02:31:33,980
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to my bad grammar and typing.

2023
02:31:34,040 --> 02:31:35,301
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry again, Sakura.

2024
02:31:36,505 --> 02:31:44,849
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to the sunburn that I got on my face while watching a spring training baseball game thanks to my sunglasses.

2025
02:31:44,889 --> 02:31:45,989
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like a raccoon now.

2026
02:31:48,210 --> 02:31:56,773
[SPEAKER_02]: LemonLimeJump says FU to all the tourists in Fort Myers that make the city swell up like a horrible infection just because Edison lived here in the winter eons ago.

2027
02:31:57,174 --> 02:31:57,694
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot.

2028
02:31:57,914 --> 02:32:00,215
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to there being no DDR machines in Fort Myers.

2029
02:32:01,488 --> 02:32:05,009
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, MPQ says, F you to being mistaken for 18.

2030
02:32:05,629 --> 02:32:06,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Doesn't do me any good.

2031
02:32:06,910 --> 02:32:07,810
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you like to do this?

2032
02:32:07,930 --> 02:32:08,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, you're not 18?

2033
02:32:09,011 --> 02:32:09,551
[SPEAKER_02]: Go away.

2034
02:32:10,231 --> 02:32:16,133
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to myself for crashing into a pole on my bike Thursday and getting a concussion and completely ruining my good day.

2035
02:32:16,533 --> 02:32:16,953
[SPEAKER_02]: P.S.

2036
02:32:17,514 --> 02:32:18,494
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to celebrities.

2037
02:32:18,874 --> 02:32:20,274
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care about the latest affair.

2038
02:32:20,575 --> 02:32:22,115
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who's fat or anorexic.

2039
02:32:22,215 --> 02:32:23,676
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care who's married or divorced.

2040
02:32:24,056 --> 02:32:25,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Just shut up already.

2041
02:32:26,357 --> 02:32:27,057
[SPEAKER_25]: I hear you ain't 18, bitch.

2042
02:32:29,130 --> 02:32:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

2043
02:32:30,090 --> 02:32:32,111
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all of our FUs that we got anyway.

2044
02:32:33,531 --> 02:32:36,592
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's it for the FUs of the week.

2045
02:32:36,612 --> 02:32:39,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for being angsty, I suppose.

2046
02:32:39,852 --> 02:32:43,053
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of one late FU I would like to say.

2047
02:32:43,613 --> 02:32:47,314
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to Spring Break Shark Attack for being on tonight on CBS.

2048
02:32:47,514 --> 02:32:51,274
[SPEAKER_02]: All these sorority girls getting eaten by sharks live on CBS.

2049
02:32:52,074 --> 02:32:52,935
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you have a TiVo.

2050
02:32:54,295 --> 02:32:54,775
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike's not on.

2051
02:32:56,488 --> 02:32:56,968
[SPEAKER_18]: Awesome!

2052
02:32:57,008 --> 02:32:57,549
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.

2053
02:32:57,789 --> 02:32:58,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Much better.

2054
02:33:05,092 --> 02:33:06,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe the sharks will... Never mind.

2055
02:33:07,233 --> 02:33:08,033
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even bring it up.

2056
02:33:08,093 --> 02:33:08,814
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't even bring it up.

2057
02:33:09,494 --> 02:33:11,135
[SPEAKER_03]: Can they eat... Not going there.

2058
02:33:11,235 --> 02:33:11,835
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

2059
02:33:17,179 --> 02:33:24,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We could tie her to David Hasselhoff and make it seem like she's running because he'll be behind.

2060
02:33:24,445 --> 02:33:26,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost like a ventriloquist doll.

2061
02:33:29,490 --> 02:33:34,834
[SPEAKER_03]: They could tie her to bars and stuff so they could have someone do a tap dance and she does a tap dance.

2062
02:33:34,854 --> 02:33:34,935
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

2063
02:33:38,826 --> 02:33:39,987
[SPEAKER_26]: I think we need to go to a break.

2064
02:33:40,668 --> 02:33:41,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh.

2065
02:33:42,149 --> 02:33:48,255
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, I want to show some keyboard mania love in this break, because I want to hear some keyboard mania songs.

2066
02:33:49,201 --> 02:33:53,302
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we come back, we'll do Ask Orange Lounge.

2067
02:33:53,322 --> 02:33:53,882
[SPEAKER_02]: How's that sound?

2068
02:33:54,362 --> 02:33:55,983
[SPEAKER_02]: And also the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

2069
02:33:56,103 --> 02:33:56,783
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get into that.

2070
02:33:56,803 --> 02:33:58,903
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can start submitting your questions for Ask Orange Lounge as well.

2071
02:33:59,804 --> 02:34:00,964
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this.

2072
02:34:01,224 --> 02:34:02,784
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do some potpourri.

2073
02:34:02,804 --> 02:34:04,365
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a mix of music in this break.

2074
02:34:04,505 --> 02:34:06,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I really want to play a Mambo A Go-Go song too.

2075
02:34:07,426 --> 02:34:11,787
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be back after this, starting off with some Klunkang.

2076
02:34:11,847 --> 02:34:12,687
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

2077
02:37:26,576 --> 02:37:27,559
Thanks for watching!

2078
02:40:16,236 --> 02:40:21,997
[SPEAKER_17]: Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Boys.

2079
02:40:23,318 --> 02:40:26,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, and we're back, boys and girls.

2080
02:40:26,638 --> 02:40:31,259
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, you can send in your questions right now for Ask Orange Lounge because we're going to be getting to that shortly.

2081
02:40:31,439 --> 02:40:34,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So we always want to hear the questions that you have.

2082
02:40:34,440 --> 02:40:40,701
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to ask us about Bimani, you want to ask us about Ditter or 2DX or whatever, Keyboard Mania.

2083
02:40:40,841 --> 02:40:43,422
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I used to be pretty good at Keyboard Mania, little known fact.

2084
02:40:43,462 --> 02:40:44,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be pretty good at it.

2085
02:40:44,946 --> 02:40:45,928
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2086
02:41:01,161 --> 02:41:01,602
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

2087
02:41:20,862 --> 02:41:22,463
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Freak, Post of the Week

2088
02:41:50,917 --> 02:41:51,397
DDR Freak Radio

2089
02:42:18,999 --> 02:42:38,012
[SPEAKER_02]: But because it is so damn big, it gets not only all the cool people like you and me and, you know, the rest of the folks here in studio, but it gets the real weirdos, and it gets the noobs, the noobs, then the trolls, and it always gets an interesting post.

2090
02:42:38,052 --> 02:42:47,778
[SPEAKER_02]: So this actually was nominated by one of our listeners, Flair One, sent me a private message and said, dude, DDR Freak Post of the Week right here, and I said, dude,

2091
02:42:48,476 --> 02:42:48,896
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.

2092
02:42:49,197 --> 02:42:49,797
[SPEAKER_02]: So here it is.

2093
02:42:51,519 --> 02:42:57,484
[SPEAKER_02]: This post is titled, Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?

2094
02:43:00,006 --> 02:43:01,007
[SPEAKER_02]: Here goes the message.

2095
02:43:02,409 --> 02:43:05,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?

2096
02:43:05,752 --> 02:43:08,174
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean like not cheating like on the controller.

2097
02:43:08,434 --> 02:43:08,935
[SPEAKER_02]: Spelled wrong.

2098
02:43:09,195 --> 02:43:10,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, is it?

2099
02:43:10,816 --> 02:43:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: I am going to attempt it tonight.

2100
02:43:14,580 --> 02:43:16,601
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going over someone's house.

2101
02:43:17,161 --> 02:43:19,402
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope their BF don't get mad.

2102
02:43:20,162 --> 02:43:23,103
[SPEAKER_02]: And then wink icon, smile icon, grin icon.

2103
02:43:23,603 --> 02:43:25,104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, what else?

2104
02:43:25,564 --> 02:43:26,284
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, people.

2105
02:43:26,765 --> 02:43:29,846
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone get a AAA on Legend of Max?

2106
02:43:31,886 --> 02:43:34,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is our DDR Freak Post of the Week.

2107
02:43:35,288 --> 02:43:37,308
[SPEAKER_25]: Technically, yes it is possible.

2108
02:43:37,789 --> 02:43:41,290
[SPEAKER_25]: If it's sex and it's DDR, chances are Loki knows about it.

2109
02:43:42,072 --> 02:43:47,455
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be possible, and this is the only way how, because it would be very difficult to have sex on DDR.

2110
02:43:47,855 --> 02:43:53,519
[SPEAKER_03]: You would have to probably be playing Disney Mix, and you'd have to play Mickey Mouse March, because it's all left and right arrows.

2111
02:43:54,099 --> 02:44:02,824
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as long as someone is on a countertop that's placed right next to the pad, you could probably be able to step the left and right arrows while thrusting into them.

2112
02:44:03,522 --> 02:44:04,583
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be the only way.

2113
02:44:05,323 --> 02:44:06,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, it's impossible.

2114
02:44:07,184 --> 02:44:12,248
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you understand the joke about this segment, but you're not actually supposed to reply to these posts.

2115
02:44:14,289 --> 02:44:23,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Might I say, the post, just as a footnote, the post was promptly locked in the next post by everyone's favorite admin, Spike.

2116
02:44:24,910 --> 02:44:31,015
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going over to someone's house and try to get them to cheat on their boyfriend with you by having sex while playing DDR.

2117
02:44:31,075 --> 02:44:32,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet Jesus, what's happening to kids these days.

2118
02:44:33,077 --> 02:44:33,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Locke?

2119
02:44:35,439 --> 02:44:37,000
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying it's possible.

2120
02:44:37,020 --> 02:44:40,443
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying that anyone should try it because that's retarded.

2121
02:44:42,364 --> 02:44:43,385
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, you had a thought.

2122
02:44:45,427 --> 02:44:48,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Just hit the pause button, get it done with, then go back and play.

2123
02:44:48,189 --> 02:44:53,293
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

2124
02:44:58,332 --> 02:44:59,372
[SPEAKER_02]: God, I love DDR Freak.

2125
02:45:00,573 --> 02:45:02,033
[SPEAKER_02]: What would we do without DDR Freak?

2126
02:45:06,695 --> 02:45:09,176
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so glad the microphone didn't pick up your little comment.

2127
02:45:11,977 --> 02:45:13,398
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Magus.

2128
02:45:15,479 --> 02:45:15,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

2129
02:45:15,899 --> 02:45:16,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, here we go.

2130
02:45:23,635 --> 02:45:26,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2131
02:45:27,076 --> 02:45:30,276
[SPEAKER_02]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2132
02:45:30,776 --> 02:45:34,017
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some noobs tonight who are asking some questions.

2133
02:45:34,537 --> 02:45:37,957
[SPEAKER_02]: I just hope they're not as bad as the post on DDR Freak.

2134
02:45:40,078 --> 02:45:44,259
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does Orange Lounge have more than, like, why does Orange have like a few syllables in there?

2135
02:45:46,959 --> 02:45:50,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to have sex while listening to Orange Lounge?

2136
02:45:50,960 --> 02:45:52,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, but we highly discourage it.

2137
02:45:53,109 --> 02:45:54,170
[SPEAKER_09]: VGM, Dear Orange Lounge Radio

2138
02:46:21,334 --> 02:46:23,815
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys and girls get paid for doing this?

2139
02:46:24,416 --> 02:46:24,656
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

2140
02:46:28,978 --> 02:46:29,378
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish.

2141
02:46:29,959 --> 02:46:30,339
[SPEAKER_02]: What can I say?

2142
02:46:30,619 --> 02:46:33,320
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we don't actually at this time.

2143
02:46:34,281 --> 02:46:40,544
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why you might remember at the beginning of the show I announced that Orange Lounge Radio is taking steps to become a business.

2144
02:46:40,624 --> 02:46:43,386
[SPEAKER_02]: And myself, Jamie, and Matt, we are all officially a partnership now.

2145
02:46:43,486 --> 02:46:49,649
[SPEAKER_02]: So you may see some little ads come to the site in the future, but no panic, please.

2146
02:46:51,201 --> 02:46:52,305
[SPEAKER_02]: We hate banner ads.

2147
02:46:52,706 --> 02:46:53,730
[SPEAKER_02]: We hate pop-ups.

2148
02:46:55,427 --> 02:46:56,488
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2149
02:47:26,144 --> 02:47:29,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says, Orange Lounge Radio question.

2150
02:47:30,867 --> 02:47:45,236
[SPEAKER_02]: If there were a sequel to be made of any music game, not Bomani, that is US, such as Frequency, Amplitude, or Taiko Drum Master, that doesn't seem like it will have a sequel, which one would you want to see a sequel from?

2151
02:47:46,217 --> 02:47:47,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts on this?

2152
02:47:48,458 --> 02:47:48,778
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus.

2153
02:47:49,919 --> 02:47:51,560
[SPEAKER_25]: Guitaroo Man, hands down.

2154
02:47:56,265 --> 02:48:01,288
[SPEAKER_02]: I would like to see another sequel to Bust a Move Groove, whatever you want to call it.

2155
02:48:01,468 --> 02:48:02,588
[SPEAKER_09]: There was Dance Summit.

2156
02:48:02,728 --> 02:48:05,289
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I'd like to see something break in the U.S.

2157
02:48:05,330 --> 02:48:05,630
[SPEAKER_02]: market.

2158
02:48:06,370 --> 02:48:08,991
[SPEAKER_08]: A real Bust a Move sequel with all the characters again.

2159
02:48:09,231 --> 02:48:13,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see another one of those, because that was really the game that got me into DDR in the first place.

2160
02:48:14,034 --> 02:48:21,897
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it's Jamie's pet peeve to call those games Bust a Groove, but when I got into them, that's what I knew them as, so I have to call them Bust a Groove.

2161
02:48:22,318 --> 02:48:22,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes?

2162
02:48:23,258 --> 02:48:23,958
[SPEAKER_08]: I know more...

2163
02:48:26,221 --> 02:48:27,682
[SPEAKER_08]: and Puyo Da.

2164
02:48:57,502 --> 02:49:03,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It could be versus the RIA this time instead of the drug dealers and stuff.

2165
02:49:06,210 --> 02:49:09,413
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's see, moving on.

2166
02:49:10,955 --> 02:49:11,715
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else though?

2167
02:49:11,856 --> 02:49:12,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Space Channel 5.

2168
02:49:12,937 --> 02:49:13,817
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see another one.

2169
02:49:14,358 --> 02:49:15,319
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh god, I love Oolala.

2170
02:49:15,639 --> 02:49:21,004
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution X2 starring the Beastie Boys because they haven't done anything good in a long time.

2171
02:49:21,474 --> 02:49:23,839
[SPEAKER_02]: There are, however, music games that don't need a sequel.

2172
02:49:24,240 --> 02:49:27,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Mad Maestro, Unison, I can't think of any of those.

2173
02:49:27,611 --> 02:49:30,712
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I like Technic Peak, you shut your mouth.

2174
02:49:32,313 --> 02:49:38,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Laser1234543 asks, can you play some Taku and give a shout out to my site?

2175
02:49:39,675 --> 02:49:43,896
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate to break it to you bud, but we actually played not one, but two Taku songs earlier in the show.

2176
02:49:44,076 --> 02:49:46,537
[SPEAKER_02]: We did Empathy and I think Karma was the other one.

2177
02:49:47,638 --> 02:49:50,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta tune in at 6.30, otherwise you miss them, sorry.

2178
02:49:50,879 --> 02:49:54,720
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if we have time we'll fit one more in, because I know Jamie will always take any excuse to play Taku.

2179
02:49:55,080 --> 02:49:55,782
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, hell yeah.

2180
02:49:56,203 --> 02:49:57,607
[SPEAKER_10]: Story time with Rob.

2181
02:49:58,809 --> 02:49:59,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I will get to that.

2182
02:50:01,917 --> 02:50:02,337
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

2183
02:50:02,617 --> 02:50:05,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, uh, can we give a shout-out to my site?

2184
02:50:05,879 --> 02:50:07,500
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, but you will have to pay for that.

2185
02:50:07,840 --> 02:50:08,840
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, I'm kidding.

2186
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:09,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, why not?

2187
02:50:10,001 --> 02:50:16,764
[SPEAKER_02]: It's laser123454321.com, but he says it's down right now, but I guess it's, um, Stepmania stuff?

2188
02:50:17,124 --> 02:50:18,025
[SPEAKER_02]: So, check it out.

2189
02:50:18,445 --> 02:50:20,446
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I've been to it, I just can't remember.

2190
02:50:20,946 --> 02:50:22,747
[SPEAKER_03]: They all start, you know, running together.

2191
02:50:23,267 --> 02:50:24,468
[SPEAKER_03]: Your mind is just a big blur.

2192
02:50:24,648 --> 02:50:28,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I need to go look for the Japanese sites again, because I used to have a bunch of them bookmarked.

2193
02:50:28,690 --> 02:50:29,570
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they kind of, like,

2194
02:50:30,291 --> 02:50:30,732
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2195
02:50:30,932 --> 02:50:31,432
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2196
02:50:31,492 --> 02:50:32,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still wondering myself.

2197
02:50:32,853 --> 02:50:37,917
[SPEAKER_02]: The only reason that I got out of it was just that I got way too busy to play.

2198
02:50:37,937 --> 02:50:39,399
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I'm on Final Fantasy XI.

2199
02:50:52,443 --> 02:51:21,871
[SPEAKER_02]: but you know what's sad is that I have had second thoughts about reactivating my account because I was up to like level 80 something on my Assassin alright you know why because it kind of a lot of the MMOs now are 3D and Ragnarok is 3D to an extent but it still has that 2D feel it has that Secret of Mana feel and I think a lot of folks that are into retro gaming have a special love for it for that reason call me crazy

2200
02:51:22,401 --> 02:51:23,042
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's it.

2201
02:51:25,665 --> 02:51:29,670
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if he means like how Burn in the Floor ratings...

2202
02:51:44,741 --> 02:51:49,045
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're talking about Step Mania, that's a whole... People can't rate their songs at all there.

2203
02:51:49,805 --> 02:52:00,334
[SPEAKER_03]: What was that song I was playing earlier this week that was a 13 on heavy and they had a... Was it an expert or extreme or whatever version that was 20?

2204
02:52:00,414 --> 02:52:02,776
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like, this is retarded.

2205
02:52:02,796 --> 02:52:03,376
[SPEAKER_27]: What's the point?

2206
02:52:06,018 --> 02:52:06,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Gotta love this.

2207
02:52:08,761 --> 02:52:11,062
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Yeah, I don't know.

2208
02:52:11,443 --> 02:52:11,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

2209
02:52:13,206 --> 02:52:22,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say it's because with different mixes, you get different developers slightly each time, so you have different opinions on what songs should be rated.

2210
02:52:22,436 --> 02:52:27,501
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they have a formula or anything, so that's the best answer I got.

2211
02:52:28,542 --> 02:52:29,023
[SPEAKER_02]: SSJ100Mac

2212
02:52:33,618 --> 02:52:34,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

2213
02:52:57,631 --> 02:53:03,775
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll probably still be doing this show out of our apartment, and so we'll have to have a little bit of caution about who's coming in and who's not.

2214
02:53:03,795 --> 02:53:05,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially, we don't want the paparazzi coming in.

2215
02:53:05,836 --> 02:53:07,617
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want the damn paparazzi in here.

2216
02:53:09,178 --> 02:53:12,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is really funny, because we could have the paparazzi in here in the near future.

2217
02:53:12,680 --> 02:53:17,703
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember back in the day when we used to have all the people that listened to our show come in?

2218
02:53:17,983 --> 02:53:19,564
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like, why is our listenership down?

2219
02:53:19,584 --> 02:53:20,585
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right, because everyone's here.

2220
02:53:22,533 --> 02:53:23,974
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't see why not.

2221
02:53:24,034 --> 02:53:25,794
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, let us know what time frame you'll be here.

2222
02:53:26,274 --> 02:53:29,876
[SPEAKER_02]: But in the future, I don't want everybody thinking that they could come.

2223
02:53:31,296 --> 02:53:35,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to try and make more public appearances at conventions in the Bay Area and stuff.

2224
02:53:35,438 --> 02:53:37,638
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be part of our, like, trying to get our name out there stuff.

2225
02:53:37,658 --> 02:53:38,499
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost did it this weekend.

2226
02:53:38,519 --> 02:53:42,260
[SPEAKER_02]: We were going to do RekkaCon, but I had to back out for other reasons.

2227
02:53:42,380 --> 02:53:43,700
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'm sorry.

2228
02:53:44,401 --> 02:53:44,641
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

2229
02:53:46,341 --> 02:53:49,542
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yes, you're special since you asked right now.

2230
02:53:49,622 --> 02:53:50,523
[SPEAKER_02]: You can visit us.

2231
02:53:50,623 --> 02:53:51,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Just us.

2232
02:53:51,448 --> 02:53:57,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Send one of us an email, either Rob or Jamie or Matt at OrangeLandradio.com and we will hook you up.

2233
02:53:58,012 --> 02:54:00,173
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Loki at OrangeLandradio.com.

2234
02:54:00,574 --> 02:54:02,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Matt auto-forwards to Loki anyways, doesn't matter.

2235
02:54:03,135 --> 02:54:04,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I get a bunch of spam.

2236
02:54:04,536 --> 02:54:07,138
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people, a lot of spammers know where my address is.

2237
02:54:07,238 --> 02:54:13,582
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can do DarkSakura and it forwards to Jamie which ends up forwarding to our other address and you can do Rob or Sky and I think it all works.

2238
02:54:15,006 --> 02:54:17,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob is what's on the business card, so that's why I wanted to tell you that.

2239
02:54:17,328 --> 02:54:23,254
[SPEAKER_03]: No one sends me mail, except for the one time when, you know, they sent me mail because I asked for a mail, but no one sends me mail other than spammers.

2240
02:54:23,535 --> 02:54:27,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And it looks like Matrix is online today, but, um... Send Loki some email, you guys.

2241
02:54:27,599 --> 02:54:29,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Send him some email.

2242
02:54:29,741 --> 02:54:31,823
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, I need to get rid of spam.

2243
02:54:32,023 --> 02:54:33,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I need a new email address.

2244
02:54:34,666 --> 02:54:34,966
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see.

2245
02:54:37,180 --> 02:54:44,246
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it looks like that's all the questions we got for right now, so I'm going to close up the Ask Orange Lounge segment.

2246
02:54:44,447 --> 02:54:45,768
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you guys for participating there.

2247
02:54:47,089 --> 02:54:50,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel reminded me to mention something funny that happened yesterday.

2248
02:54:50,992 --> 02:54:57,118
[SPEAKER_02]: We were playing DDR, because I mentioned I went to the bowling alley that's open 24 hours, and I was playing some in the groove, and they also have DDR.

2249
02:54:57,678 --> 02:55:00,360
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know why, if it's just because I'm kind of...

2250
02:55:01,461 --> 02:55:02,502
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

2251
02:55:18,730 --> 02:55:33,634
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it as well, I did Roulette on my extra stage, and remember, extra stage is reverse 1.5 speed, because I secretly don't like doing Legend of Max, because I really can't pass it, because I'm just, I'm old, and it's too fast, and, you know, it's just too much for me.

2252
02:55:33,994 --> 02:55:38,416
[SPEAKER_02]: So, call me a sucky DDR player, I don't care, but I can't pass Legend of Max extra stage.

2253
02:55:38,896 --> 02:55:40,196
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too much, too much stamina.

2254
02:55:40,736 --> 02:55:43,997
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do 1.5 reverse, and guess what song I end up with?

2255
02:55:44,437 --> 02:55:46,338
[SPEAKER_02]: Bag, as my extra stage.

2256
02:55:46,969 --> 02:55:51,851
[SPEAKER_02]: and it lands on bag and all I hear is Angelstar going, Ahahaha!

2257
02:55:52,411 --> 02:55:53,692
[SPEAKER_20]: Ahahaha!

2258
02:55:53,852 --> 02:55:54,732
[SPEAKER_20]: Sucks to be you!

2259
02:55:55,472 --> 02:55:57,073
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not, I said no!

2260
02:55:58,714 --> 02:56:00,214
[SPEAKER_02]: You were totally pointing and laughing at me.

2261
02:56:00,494 --> 02:56:06,197
[SPEAKER_02]: The sad thing is I actually did it and I was kind of doing it for a little while but then I was like, I'm too old and I quit.

2262
02:56:06,497 --> 02:56:08,618
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't hold on to the bar or anything.

2263
02:56:08,658 --> 02:56:14,300
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not saying I'm against bar raping, I'm just, I personally am not a bar holder player type.

2264
02:56:16,260 --> 02:56:18,462
[SPEAKER_25]: Next time you consider bar raping, think of the bar.

2265
02:56:20,483 --> 02:56:21,985
[SPEAKER_02]: What did the bar do to you, huh?

2266
02:56:22,745 --> 02:56:23,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

2267
02:56:25,047 --> 02:56:30,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I guess it's that time to start thinking about wrapping up this program.

2268
02:56:30,772 --> 02:56:36,997
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys for tuning in tonight, and we hope to see you next week, but we can't end it until we get our final thoughts.

2269
02:56:37,838 --> 02:56:39,419
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, your final thought.

2270
02:56:41,581 --> 02:56:44,263
[SPEAKER_25]: Needs more nachos and possibly a little more cowbell.

2271
02:56:46,323 --> 02:56:46,663
Angel.

2272
02:56:47,323 --> 02:56:48,924
[SPEAKER_10]: No more bag on roulette.

2273
02:56:53,746 --> 02:56:54,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Nellie, do you have a final thought?

2274
02:56:55,967 --> 02:56:58,508
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want me to talk about the dead woman again?

2275
02:56:58,628 --> 02:56:58,908
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

2276
02:56:59,168 --> 02:56:59,809
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm just kidding.

2277
02:57:00,029 --> 02:57:00,289
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

2278
02:57:00,629 --> 02:57:01,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, your final thought.

2279
02:57:03,030 --> 02:57:07,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen to the podcast where you'll hear more about my dog throwing poop on stuff.

2280
02:57:10,673 --> 02:57:13,054
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dark... Oh, my final thought... I'll let you have last.

2281
02:57:13,194 --> 02:57:14,375
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is...

2282
02:57:16,343 --> 02:57:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: All you motherfuckers are gonna pay!

2283
02:57:18,064 --> 02:57:19,726
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers!

2284
02:57:20,786 --> 02:57:21,927
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2285
02:57:28,852 --> 02:57:29,593
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you know me?

2286
02:57:30,193 --> 02:57:31,054
[SPEAKER_09]: I am so famous.

2287
02:57:32,855 --> 02:57:34,777
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.

2288
02:57:34,817 --> 02:57:37,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting and listening.

2289
02:57:39,420 --> 02:57:41,162
[SPEAKER_02]: Magus, you get tonight's final word.

2290
02:57:41,402 --> 02:57:42,943
[SPEAKER_02]: One word to sum it all up.

2291
02:57:45,124 --> 02:57:45,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Veggies!

2292
02:57:49,685 --> 02:57:52,726
[SPEAKER_21]: And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2293
02:58:14,051 --> 02:58:15,672
[SPEAKER_00]: We did it all, we did it all, we did it all.

2294
02:58:15,692 --> 02:58:22,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills, lewds, coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?

2295
02:58:22,235 --> 02:58:22,755
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we did.

2296
02:58:23,275 --> 02:58:24,516
[SPEAKER_00]: People go, well, why don't you go into rehab?

2297
02:58:24,536 --> 02:58:26,357
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have rehab back in the 70s.

2298
02:58:26,937 --> 02:58:31,259
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the 70s, rehab meant you'd stop doing coke, but you kept smoking pot and drinking for a couple more weeks, you know?

2299
02:58:32,179 --> 02:58:33,740
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, give me a case of Budweiser and an ounce.

2300
02:58:33,760 --> 02:58:35,201
[SPEAKER_00]: I gotta slow down, Jesus Christ.

2301
02:58:35,761 --> 02:58:36,381
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of control.

2302
02:58:36,401 --> 02:58:38,222
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the size of my pants, for Christ's sake.

2303
02:58:43,203 --> 02:58:44,124
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the big thing now.

2304
02:58:44,164 --> 02:58:46,346
[SPEAKER_00]: Rehab is the big fucking secret now, isn't it, huh?

2305
02:58:46,706 --> 02:58:48,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can do whatever you want, just go into rehab and solve your problems.

2306
02:58:48,888 --> 02:58:49,829
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that the big celebrity thing?

2307
02:58:49,849 --> 02:58:50,810
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm going to do.

2308
02:58:51,451 --> 02:58:52,271
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm going to get famous.

2309
02:58:52,752 --> 02:58:56,555
[SPEAKER_00]: Then when my career starts to flag, I'm going to go on a three-month fucking bender, okay?

2310
02:58:56,895 --> 02:59:04,382
[SPEAKER_00]: Coke and fucking pot and smack and fucking booze and drive over people and beat up my kids, go into therapy, go into rehab, come out of rehab, be on the cover of People magazine.

2311
02:59:04,602 --> 02:59:05,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry!

2312
02:59:07,565 --> 02:59:08,306
[SPEAKER_00]: I fucked up!

2313
02:59:10,805 --> 02:59:15,268
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do, man, they go in a rehab and they come out and they blame everybody except themselves They blame their parents, right?

2314
02:59:15,508 --> 02:59:18,029
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the way everybody comes from a dysfunctional family all of a sudden, huh?

2315
02:59:18,509 --> 02:59:20,450
[SPEAKER_00]: Roseanne Barr comes from a dysfunctional family?

2316
02:59:20,490 --> 02:59:26,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Not Roseanne, she seems so normal to me The Jacksons were dysfunctional?

2317
02:59:26,154 --> 02:59:37,280
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the Jacksons These people give each other new heads for Christmas, for Christ's sake I am sick and tired of hearing that fucking speech, you know?

2318
02:59:38,382 --> 02:59:40,363
[SPEAKER_00]: These people come out of rehab and they always have the same story.

2319
02:59:40,383 --> 02:59:44,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I became an alcoholic because my parents didn't love me enough.

2320
02:59:45,245 --> 02:59:47,766
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I became a junkie because my parents didn't love me enough.

2321
02:59:48,167 --> 02:59:51,608
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went into hypnosis and therapy and I found out that my parents used to hit me.

2322
02:59:51,628 --> 02:59:54,750
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay?

2323
02:59:55,170 --> 02:59:56,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And looking back on it, I'm glad they did.

2324
02:59:56,791 --> 02:59:59,512
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm looking forward to beating the shit out of my kids, aren't you?

2325
03:00:02,992 --> 03:00:04,613
[SPEAKER_00]: for no reason whatsoever.

2326
03:00:04,633 --> 03:00:05,733
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you hit me for?

2327
03:00:05,773 --> 03:00:07,874
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut up and get out there and mow the lawn, for Christ's sake.

2328
03:00:08,454 --> 03:00:13,995
[SPEAKER_00]: There's therapy for you, mowing the lawn and crying at the same time.

2329
03:00:14,356 --> 03:00:15,656
[SPEAKER_00]: Delirious kids in therapy again.

2330
03:00:15,676 --> 03:00:16,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Their lawn looks great.

2331
03:00:16,536 --> 03:00:17,337
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unbelievable.

2332
03:00:20,638 --> 03:00:21,218
[SPEAKER_00]: God.

2333
03:00:21,978 --> 03:00:22,918
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

2334
03:00:23,518 --> 03:00:24,519
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

2335
03:00:25,559 --> 03:00:28,780
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy because my life didn't turn out the way I thought it would.

2336
03:00:28,800 --> 03:00:31,261
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, join the fucking club, okay?

2337
03:00:32,210 --> 03:00:36,994
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox Life sucks, get a fucking helmet, alright?

2338
03:00:41,818 --> 03:00:44,621
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not happy, I'm not happy Nobody's happy, okay?

2339
03:00:44,641 --> 03:00:50,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Happiness comes in small doses, folks It's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm That's it, okay?

2340
03:00:50,266 --> 03:00:54,349
[SPEAKER_00]: You come, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt You go to sleep, you get up in the morning and go to fucking work, okay?

2341
03:00:55,090 --> 03:00:57,092
[SPEAKER_00]: That is it, end of fucking list

2342
03:01:00,177 --> 03:01:01,197
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just not happy.

2343
03:01:01,277 --> 03:01:02,938
[SPEAKER_00]: Shut the fuck up, all right?

2344
03:01:03,778 --> 03:01:07,399
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of my new book, Shut the Fuck Up by Dr. Dennis Larry.

2345
03:01:08,499 --> 03:01:10,479
[SPEAKER_00]: A revolutionary new form of therapy.

2346
03:01:10,499 --> 03:01:13,400
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have my patients come in, doctor, I say, shut the fuck up next.

2347
03:01:14,620 --> 03:01:16,761
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel so, shut the fuck up next.

2348
03:01:17,841 --> 03:01:19,741
[SPEAKER_00]: He made me feel so much better about myself, you know?

2349
03:01:20,141 --> 03:01:22,722
[SPEAKER_00]: He just told me to shut the fuck up and nobody ever told me that before.

2350
03:01:22,782 --> 03:01:23,662
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel so much better now.

2351
03:01:25,883 --> 03:01:27,283
[SPEAKER_00]: Whining fucking maggots.

2352
03:01:30,345 --> 03:01:31,106
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these people quitting.

2353
03:01:31,126 --> 03:01:36,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, I think it's a good thing, AA, and the recovery and rehab, because I've got some friends who would be dead without those programs, but you know something?

2354
03:01:36,170 --> 03:01:41,995
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we have a different problem, because now they quit drinking and drugs, they're completely stressed out, and they decide to work out, which is fine.

2355
03:01:42,336 --> 03:01:44,458
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a workout guy, but I understood Nautilus.

2356
03:01:44,498 --> 03:01:49,582
[SPEAKER_00]: It made sense that we're arm machines and leg machines, but have you seen these people who are using the Stairmaster?

2357
03:01:50,163 --> 03:01:52,525
[SPEAKER_00]: Have we turned into gerbils, ladies and gentlemen?

2358
03:01:53,129 --> 03:01:57,451
[SPEAKER_00]: People are paying money to go into a health club and walk up invisible steps over and over again for an hour and a half.

2359
03:01:57,671 --> 03:01:58,171
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?

2360
03:01:58,411 --> 03:01:59,051
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going up!

2361
03:01:59,371 --> 03:02:00,392
[SPEAKER_00]: And I paid for it, too.

2362
03:02:00,432 --> 03:02:01,872
[SPEAKER_00]: I can stay here as long as I want, folks.

2363
03:02:02,053 --> 03:02:05,194
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to go up and downstairs, move into a fifth floor, walk up on the Lower East Side, okay?

2364
03:02:06,114 --> 03:02:06,614
[SPEAKER_00]: What's next?

2365
03:02:06,694 --> 03:02:07,735
[SPEAKER_00]: A fucking chair master?

2366
03:02:07,775 --> 03:02:09,735
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up.

2367
03:02:09,976 --> 03:02:13,417
[SPEAKER_00]: The door master, I open the door, I go... What the fuck?

2368
03:02:17,719 --> 03:02:21,180
[SPEAKER_21]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
