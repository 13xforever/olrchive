1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,640
Is everyone Chicken Factory, an old school play?

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,740
It is so

3
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:14,060
old

4
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:21,600
I am sorry

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:27,560
Yes, we are

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:47,560
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.

7
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:54,560
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.

8
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:45,000
Oh God!

9
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Call me Daddy.

10
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Orange Lounge may contain adult content. Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.

11
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

12
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
B-b-b-cocky.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that. In this episode...

14
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Isn't that special?

15
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:36,000
And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, Dark Sakura, Skye and Loki

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:50,000
We are live, and this is episode number 136 for this Sunday, March 20th, 2005.

18
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:58,000
You're tuned in to the gaming scene's most fanatical radio station of all things B. Money.

19
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:06,000
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Skye, or you might know me as That Guy, or Asshole, or, yeah.

20
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Also joining me, as always, say hello to my lovely co-host, Ms. Dark Sackroyd, Jamie Sommers!

21
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I am the lord of the dance!

22
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Are you now?

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
No.

24
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Also joining us, say hello to our other lovely co-host, uh, Loki!

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Hi.

26
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
And also joining us tonight, we have special guests.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
We have Loki's fiance, who never speaks.

28
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Hello.

29
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Wow! We got her to say something.

30
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
We have, um, and that'll be it for the whole show.

31
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have Ditter Angel.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Is the mic on over there?

33
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
There we go.

34
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Got turned on.

35
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
That's right.

36
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Now we can hear you.

37
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
What'd you call me?

38
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
What'd you call me?

39
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Ditter Angel.

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Um, I guess, yeah, sure. Um, wrong.

41
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:13,000
And also say hello to somebody who hasn't been here in a while. Usually accompanies Ditter Angel to the shows, but I hear he's got that work thing going on, but he's here tonight. Say hello to Nygoss!

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Eh, that work thing's a bitch, ain't it?

43
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yeah. Real life sucks. That is the motto of Orange Laundrado, by the way. Real life sucks.

44
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We've got a fun show for you guys tonight. Well, at least we're going to try.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Some actual Bahmani news to talk about. A whole lot of Night Style news going on right now this week.

46
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,000
A whole lot of regular gaming news going on as well, because you know, you've got the PSP coming out next week.

47
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
So, definitely want to talk about Night Style. Our whole first break is about Night Style.

48
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:50,000
And of course, your favorite segments here on Orange Launch Radio, such as the Cage match, FUs of the Week,

49
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:52,520
Yes

50
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,120
Kicking somebody in the balls and

51
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:59,880
How was your week? How is your day or as I'm going to call it the El mullet Honorary

52
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,860
How is your week? How is your day? Because he's such a big fan of the segments, so

53
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:09,140
that'll be up first when we come back the El mullet Honorary, how was your week, how was your day after this break and

54
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,380
In this break, we're gonna hear some music from nine sound. We're gonna start it off with some fun

55
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:17,160
It's fun

56
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, Bahmani is fun. Yeah

57
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,600
Yeah, sure.

58
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:21,600
Fun.

59
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,600
Fun.

60
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
fun

61
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,600
You

62
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,600
You

63
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:51,600
Orange Lounge Radio

64
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,100
Bomani Music, and more.

65
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,400
Perfect!

66
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,600
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break of Night Style.

67
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,100
Starting it off with a little bit of fun by Mr. T.

68
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:12,600
Karma, Taku, Starfield by Sada, and Rick being remixed by Hisashi and Nawata with Rizlum, the remix there.

69
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,600
Hope you enjoyed that.

70
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:17,600
Or if you're Jamie, you didn't enjoy that, I don't know.

71
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,240
dot, dot, dot. What is your problem with Night Style, anyway? I love Night Style.

72
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,720
Stupid timing bullshit, which I hope they fixed in the home version.

73
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:29,960
We will find out very soon. I'm gonna order mine just so I can have it. I'm still missing

74
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:33,480
Fourth Style, though. Yeah. Oh, man.

75
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:37,440
You know, Night Style actually brought a lot of songs over from Fourth Style in

76
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:38,200
their returning songs, like

77
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:42,120
Empathy, hello, like one of the best Taku songs ever. They brought back for Night Style.

78
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:42,840
That makes me happy.

79
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:46,320
Empathy pisses me off. But I love Empathy! It still pisses me off. You shut your mouth!

80
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay. For the next, for the next break, I will do some forest-style music just to make you happy. What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?

81
00:13:54,320 --> 00:14:05,320
Oh my god, I finally did the little flash game on the, uh, the, uh, grudge site, and it's kind of spooky.

82
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:11,320
Speaking of, uh, you know, Japanese movies that became American movies, did you get a chance to go see Ring 2 yet?

83
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,320
No.

84
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I hear it's crap, which makes me sad because the first one is seriously one of the greatest horror movies.

85
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:20,320
Because it hardly deviated from the original.

86
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm going to go see it, but I'm still waiting for Darkwater.

87
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,320
But I want to buy the book first.

88
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
I'm so happy because Loop is going to be out soon.

89
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,320
Really?

90
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Loop is the third book in the Ring series, which, if you read the books, it goes in a completely different direction.

91
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Although, from watching the trailers of Ring 2, it sort of seems like a tie-in almost.

92
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:42,320
Hm.

93
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:45,000
Cuz I could spoil it for a bunch of people.

94
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,000
No!

95
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
The book series.

96
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,000
I wouldn't do that if I were you.

97
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,440
I don't know who here is actually going to read the books.

98
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:53,440
Come on.

99
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,880
Does any of our listeners look like they read?

100
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,880
I'm just kidding.

101
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
I'm totally kidding you guys.

102
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,880
Does they or do they?

103
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,880
Exactly.

104
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:02,880
I am smart.

105
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Do I look like I read?

106
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:11,120
Yeah, I got you that Harry Potter book and you never read it.

107
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:14,360
I, I, now wait a minute, I read two chapters.

108
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:17,680
Give me a break.

109
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:23,840
I, I do want to read Harry Potter someday. You can read.

110
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,200
Anyway, uh, starting off...

111
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,720
Starting off tonight's show...

112
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,320
actually before we get into the El Mullet honorary how was your week, how was your day segment

113
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:40,420
I want to give a little bit, I want to give a bit of congratulations

114
00:15:40,420 --> 00:15:44,540
to some individuals out there and in my honest opinion no one deserves

115
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:46,700
congratulations more so than us

116
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:50,380
so I would like to congratulate us because as of today

117
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:54,300
effective now we are officially Orange Lawn Radio

118
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,940
a legal partnership and so that means what does that mean I know who cares

119
00:15:58,940 --> 00:15:59,220
right

120
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,460
What does that mean? We are taking the first step in becoming a

121
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:05,460
legitimate business operation.

122
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,780
Woohoo, we're media. Woohoo. Woohoo.

123
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,900
We're gonna have our paparazzi.

124
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:15,860
And what was great is that when we were filling out the documents, you know, there's all this legal mumbo jumbo

125
00:16:15,860 --> 00:16:17,300
and there's this bit in there about

126
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:20,660
how to settle a dispute. And it's talking about, you know,

127
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:25,460
if the partners cannot settle a dispute, then the argument will be settled by

128
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:28,540
arbitration from the American Arbitration Association.

129
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,260
And we decided, you know, we ought to actually settle these things with like a DDR match.

130
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,580
Or, I was about to say that too. Or, I was,

131
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:40,100
I also had suggested a cream corn

132
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,740
wrestling cage match. If it's chess I'll win. He totally will win, I suck at chess, I'm horrible.

133
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:49,640
Alright, anyway, so we're officially on our way.

134
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:53,260
Which you know that means, because we are officially becoming a business,

135
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:57,060
you can expect pop-ups to be coming to the site effective tomorrow. No, I'm kidding.

136
00:16:57,060 --> 00:17:01,000
until I get we will not be having pop-up ads on the site pop-up ads are evil and

137
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:04,840
half of you guys have them blocked anyway so what good would it do anyway

138
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:11,800
so congratulations to us we all right and if you would like to send a cash

139
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,920
congratulations a cash notice or a cash thank you like now for you yeah just

00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:21,240

142
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:32,920
Alright, and now for the El Mullet honorary how was your week, how was your day segment?

143
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:36,040
A little bit about us and how our day is going.

144
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I worked.

145
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,040
Jamie.

146
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:44,200
I worked, I went to school, yay, I exercised a lot, yay, um, I actually though, I was all

147
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,980
nervous about my photoshop assignment and then I found that he postponed in another

148
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,980
two weeks.

149
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:53,440
Excuse me and I just burped, nacho burp.

150
00:17:53,440 --> 00:18:00,440
Anyway, um, it was, it was very cool, um, yesterday I hung out with, um, Tia and some

151
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:07,920
of her friends, and I went to Curves. I had never been before.

152
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,160
Isn't Curves the place that plays Jesus music while you work out?

153
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:15,840
No, they played, like, dance music. Oh. I heard they play Jesus music. That's why,

154
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:19,280
you know, that's why my mom stopped going. No, this is the one downtown.

155
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,280
Oh, well, I guess maybe it's different. It depends on which one you go to, because

156
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:27,820
I think they're sort of I think they're franchised. Well, maybe that's it then. But this one was downtown

157
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:34,760
It was kind of neat. It wasn't, you know, the exercise I need but I still got a workout out of it

158
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:42,140
But it uses resistance machine machines and these bouncy things that you hop up and down on in between to the resistance machines

159
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:46,060
And you're only doing this like 15-30 seconds each time

160
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:50,220
But as you go through a couple of circuits of it, you're like whoo tired

161
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:55,540
But it wasn't really, I was tired but not like fatigued, not like I'm supposed to be.

162
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,420
I didn't hurt.

163
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,260
And unless it hurts, for me, it's not a workout.

164
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:11,780
So today I played like three hours of Silent Hill 3 and sat around on my ass and that was

165
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:13,120
about it.

166
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
It rained.

167
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,020
It was thundering and lightning last night.

168
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:20,060
Oh my gosh, the thunder woke me up at like 3 o'clock in the morning.

169
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,060
I was so scared.

170
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,060
Oh, it helped me sleep.

171
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,060
Thank you for reminding me, by the way.

172
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:28,360
In case the storms come back, just to alert all our listeners, if we suddenly drop, like

173
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,140
we're suddenly disconnected, that means the Orange Lounge Studios got hit with lightning.

174
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,140
It stopped raining, though.

175
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,940
So, yeah, I know, but, you know, you never know, it might pick back up.

176
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:39,060
It doesn't thunder and lightning here by my standards.

177
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,060
I know, I know.

178
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,700
I have fried four modems, personally.

179
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,180
Understand, we here on the West Coast, and I realize we're an international show, we

180
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,800
We here on the West Coast are big pussies when it comes to storms, because it just doesn't

181
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:55,180
rain here like it does on the East Coast, okay?

182
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,420
I know, I'm familiar with how it rains on the East Coast.

183
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:01,520
We don't get hurricanes or any of that shit, so like when it starts raining hard and there's

184
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:04,840
a lot of lightning, we're like, oh my god, run!

185
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:06,360
And then I sit back and laugh.

186
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:09,400
We got our first tornado, like in ten years.

187
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:13,840
We had a tornado, like two weeks ago, and people were freaking out because it actually

188
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:14,840
touched down.

189
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,280
Now granted, I think it may be like picked up a cow and moved it six feet, and that was

190
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
like the extent of the damage, but yeah, I mean people were freaking out, they're like

191
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,160
oh my god a tornado!

192
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:31,600
Just bear in mind, if we suddenly drop, just keep this mental image in mind, we're all

193
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,480
piled up in the bathtub and Rob is on top.

194
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Don't you know it, I will be on top.

195
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,940
If we drop it means the tornado dropped a cow on us.

196
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,000
There's no place like Orange Lounge, there's no place like Orange Lounge.

197
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,000
Auntie Em! Auntie Em!

198
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,040
themselves. My mom's like a Jewish hag. Like, she's a total goy, okay? But, I don't know

199
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:24,680
what you'd call that. But, so she was like, you know, out of respect for her Jewish friends,

200
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,960
she said, you know, I don't think they should be playing Jesus music here because that might

201
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:31,840
be offensive to some people. So, I just thought that was interesting. That's my, that's the

202
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,740
story about my mom and Curves. It was in Roseville, which I realize means nothing to you guys

203
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:43,960
that are out there listening internationally. But imagine, like, a town that is really white

204
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:46,960
and has no culture whatsoever. That's Roseville.

205
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:49,960
And you have to pay long distance to call, like, into Sacramento.

206
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,960
Yeah, seriously, and there's a-

207
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,960
You guys are so far removed from reality.

208
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,960
There's a Starbucks on every corner. I mean, I don't know how to split it.

209
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
Anyway.

210
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,960
Sorry.

211
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Um, I'm gonna keep going for the rest of the week just because I have a free week.

212
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,960
Um, I'm gonna ask her, though, if she'll let me do a write-up on it,

213
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:14,320
I'm wanting to promote, you know, more fitness for everybody.

214
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:18,540
You know, people need to get off their asses and actually do something for their health,

215
00:22:18,540 --> 00:22:25,080
so I'm hoping that I can do a nice write-up on it and encourage people that if, you know,

216
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:30,380
the good thing about this is that it's an all-women gym, so if you're feeling self-conscious

217
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,380
–

218
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:32,820
Sorry, go ahead.

219
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,820
I'm not laughing at that.

220
00:22:33,820 --> 00:22:34,820
I'm laughing at something else.

221
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:38,160
In general, though, like for women in general, there are – there's coverings on the windows

222
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:42,720
nobody can peek in and watch you. It's because you all exercise topless right?

223
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:50,720
No. See that would be hot and all topless too. And they are very encouraging and since it's so small you

224
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,600
don't have to worry about a big gym full of people at different because

225
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,380
everybody is going to be at their own fitness level but everybody's really

226
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,880
supportive so it's a really good place for someone who may be new to exercise

227
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:05,800
or looking just to lean up a bit not necessarily bulk up or is self-conscious.

228
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:11,760
They, the reason why I was giggling is because they have a guy's, they have an all-guy gymnasium

229
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
called CUTS.

230
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,640
Yeah, it's the same thing I think.

231
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,600
But they don't cover the windows, like, you know.

232
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,520
Well, Rob just made a valid case for cross-dressing.

233
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:26,760
It would, oh whatever, this is not a bad episode of Bosom Buddies, okay?

234
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,400
My life is not an episode of Bosom Buddies.

235
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,760
I am not that interested in going to curves just to check out women exercising.

236
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:33,760
Although...

237
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,760
Well, you wouldn't.

238
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:38,880
This is interesting because, going into my, I'll just start with my week and my day since

239
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:39,880
this kind of leads into it.

240
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:44,580
I was actually apartment hunting today, scouting out where the new home of Orange Lawn Studios

241
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,080
will be for a little while.

242
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
Oh, I thought you said you were done.

243
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,200
No, I went to go blow my nose.

244
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:53,520
Oh, I'm sorry, well then go ahead and finish and I'll tell my piece.

245
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:57,560
The rest of it was spent working on my wedding, which I signed up for this online wedding

246
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:58,560
thing.

247
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,520
They had me budgeted at $15,000, which I find incredibly retarded.

248
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:07,520
I chopped it down to 5,000, and that's just for the essentials of having a very basic

249
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:10,840
ceremony and paying for food.

250
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:18,880
And then I did some house hunting, and found out that those online foreclosure sites suck.

251
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,040
So I'm going to have to see about getting a bank less somewhere.

252
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:26,040
And now I'm done.

253
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
Okay.

254
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,080
Oh yeah, apartment hunting.

255
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,600
Okay, so I was apartment hunting today.

256
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,280
And me and my buddy Christopher, you know, we're both, you know, if you haven't heard,

257
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:38,280
I happen to be a gay male, and my buddy Christopher is also a gay male.

258
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:44,160
I don't think we exactly exude gay when we go out in public.

259
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:49,240
I mean, I realize people figure me out after spending quality time with me, but I think

260
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:54,280
when I go in in a professional setting, I don't think I'm like, you know, hi everybody!

261
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,520
You know, I don't think I'm like Richard Simmons gay, okay?

262
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:01,200
Like I think I'm pretty, you know, quote unquote just like everybody else.

263
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:07,440
I don't know how to say it. I'm on low heat, yes. If gayness was an oven setting, I'm like

264
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,840
hold warm. That's me. My flames are hold warm.

265
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,240
You're not like Lagerfeld. No, I'm not like Carl Lagerfeld.

266
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:15,400
You don't have the fan. No, I don't carry a fucking fan. I mean,

267
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,960
that stuff. Your ab would fucking make you differ on that

268
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,560
one, though. Well, we went to an apartment complex today.

269
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:24,100
We went to an apartment complex, and when we walked in, the guy was like, okay, what

270
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,960
kind of size apartment are you interested in getting in?

271
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,040
We said, well, maybe like a two or three bedroom. And he's like, oh, you guys don't want a one

272
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:36,000
bedroom?" And we were like, uh, it's, it's not like that. And he's like, oh, okay. Like,

273
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:40,360
he just assumed that we were together and we wanted a one bedroom. And I realized that

274
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:45,040
it's possible for heterosexual males to share a one bedroom, like college, you know, things

275
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:51,440
like that. That's perfectly normal. But it's, like, once you get to be 26, you know, unless

276
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,120
you're poor. Yeah, time, it's about time to get your own bedroom unless, you know, you're

277
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:58,240
poor. But I like to think I make reasonably good money where I can afford my own bedroom,

278
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:04,200
and so does Christopher. So anyway, my point. He was giving us the tour. So now we're straight

279
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:08,200
in his minds because, you know, he offended us with the gay comment. So we were walking

280
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,960
around and he showed us the gymnasium and there were these two girls and they were pretty

281
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:16,000
attractive. These two girls that were in the gymnasium work it out and he's like, yeah,

282
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,360
we got girls that work out in this gym. And the girls, like you could tell, were embarrassed.

283
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:23,960
And I was just like, oh, those poor girls. And like I just wanted to tell them, you have

284
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,120
nothing to worry about. I'm not checking you out in that kind of way. I'm strictly looking

285
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:34,660
at the equipment you're using but you know I don't want to go there yeah I was

286
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:39,480
checking out their equipment that's a very top-heavy equipment there at the

287
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:45,240
gymnasium anyway so yeah apartment hunting that was my um how's my day oh

288
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:48,920
what else I do this week I went to Country Club lanes yesterday which is

289
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:53,740
one of our local arcades it's the 24-hour arcade here in Sacramento and so

290
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,440
I got to play a little bit in the groove I'll um you know which I've been playing

291
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,920
a little more and more of. I'm really trying to warm up to In The Groove. Nothing's really

292
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:08,640
changed on my opinion on it. But I also played Beatmania 3, 6 Mix, and I got to watch Andrew

293
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:14,440
play Instant Love, which was the shit, because I love that song. But I was pissed off because

294
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:19,360
the two-player side, all the keys were broken, so I cannot play center mode. And I am a turntable

295
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:24,120
left kind of guy, so that's why Beatmania 5 Key Machines pissed me off, because I have

296
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:30,840
to play center and it's all weird but left pride yo I guess that's my week I

297
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:35,440
don't have anything else interesting to share left pride in my ass you know what

298
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:40,120
you want to settle this with a cream corn match no all right this could be

299
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:46,080
our first dispute this could be our first official dispute all right Wow I

You have a mic. Tell us about your weekend or day.

302
00:27:52,040 --> 00:27:59,040
Alright. Just, well, mostly all the same. Work, school, work, school, work, school.

303
00:27:59,040 --> 00:28:07,040
Finally got sick of it. Took a weekend off. Went to RecaCon yesterday. Shout-outs to everyone there.

304
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:18,040
Came in day after just completely blowing my legs out on DDR, and the rest is going on right now.

305
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:20,040
Nothing much to talk about, though.

306
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:26,040
Alright, how boring you are. Just kidding.

307
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:31,040
He's a working boy now. Jamie, this boy has grown up so fast right before our eyes.

308
00:28:33,040 --> 00:28:34,040
Good.

309
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:35,040
Remember when-

310
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,040
I smell a repressed dot dot frickin' dot.

311
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,040
Remember when he was an angsty little Republican asshole?

312
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:45,040
Now he's only a semi-angsty Republican asshole.

313
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,040
With a sense of responsibility.

314
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:50,040
That's okay, we'll beat the partisanship out of you.

315
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,040
It's not like I'm crawling in my skin or anything.

316
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,040
And you know I love you.

317
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,040
In a heterosexual way.

318
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:58,040
In a heterosexual top-heavy way.

319
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,040
Angel!

320
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,040
Hey, as long as it's top-heavy.

321
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,040
Angel.

322
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:04,040
You're weak in your day.

323
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,040
Stop laughing.

324
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:08,040
I can't help it.

325
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:10,040
Stop laughing. This is a serious discussion.

326
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,040
Oh really?

327
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:14,040
You're the one holding nachos in your lap.

328
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,040
Anyway.

329
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:22,240
needed to know that. No, but yeah, they were just there, whatever. I don't know, just work

330
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:31,360
in school and I had finals this week, so yay. Half of my school days are done for right

331
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,160
now and that's cool because it's going to be a much lighter load in the next nine weeks

332
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:45,120
so that's cool. Not much going on, I guess, except for Racket Con yesterday, which was

333
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I got to see all the people that I haven't seen in like two years, so...

334
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Residence of East Contra Costa County.

335
00:29:55,120 --> 00:30:03,320
anime convention. Okay, cool. I wanted to go. I saw we. That's alright. If anybody that

336
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:06,520
went to Wreck-A-Con is listening, please don't tell me how fabulous the convention was, because

337
00:30:06,520 --> 00:30:11,640
I'm quite bitter. I'm just kidding, I'll get over it. Wendell sends his love. Aw, I miss

338
00:30:11,640 --> 00:30:14,560
Wendell. And Jahi, and everyone else. Aw, I'm gonna play the Step Squad promo after

339
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:19,720
the next break, so I can hear them. Yay! Okay. Anyway, yeah, so, everyone was there, it was

340
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:27,220
cool I got chased by an agent that was weird oh I thought you said I got chased

341
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:34,000
by an Asian no I'm like what we had an agent Smith cosplayer oh let's just say

342
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:40,560
he's been discouraging me from playing playing MXO lately my you were playing

343
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:45,680
this I sense a dispute and cream corn I see a

344
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I'm tempted to think that they're going to turn into that Agent Smith cosplayer.

345
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:57,680
Out of curiosity, how is MXO? Like, besides, I saw Loki play it for like 15 minutes, but that was about it?

346
00:30:57,680 --> 00:31:00,680
It needs work, but it's got potential.

347
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
Okay.

348
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:14,680
Sega and, you know, Warner Bros. are completely new to MMOs, so they got a lot to learn from, say, Final Fantasy XI, World of Warcraft, or even EverQuest. They've still got a lot to learn.

349
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,680
And that was your MMO update. Sorry, Angel.

350
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:21,680
As I just taunted in front of the mic, that was funny.

351
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:24,680
Alright, um, let's see. Yeah, record's on yesterday.

352
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:30,680
CCL last night. Yay for CCL, or something. Damn those card systems! Damn them!

353
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,680
Those stupid cards you wouldn't rate, and I'm going, what the hell?

354
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:37,680
Oh, I know. What is up with arcades that use cards?

355
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:41,680
Yeah, cards with a little magnetic strip on the back so it looks like it's all important or something.

356
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:44,180
The card for CCL is ugly, too.

357
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:49,180
I'm gonna go put the card up on the webcam, www.orangelonsradio.com.

358
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:51,180
It's not fugly, it's more fugly.

359
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:55,180
People are wondering when MXO is. The Matrix Online.

360
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:56,180
Yes.

361
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:59,180
Put the card on the cam.

362
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:04,680
And other than that, not much except for coming to show today.

363
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:07,680
So there's not that much in my life going on.

364
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,180
Yet.

365
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:11,540
Or something except for spring break starting tomorrow

366
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,940
Yay, spring break whoo-hoo

367
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:19,700
Where I'm going to do nothing but play MMOs all week or something

368
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,600
What you're not going to nude beach you dumbass

369
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:32,220
Really screw the nude beach I'm gonna go to curves because they all exercise topless there

370
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:39,220
at the nude beach, heck yeah

371
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,860
alright anyway

372
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:48,540
is that it angel? yes okay sorry that's right hand the mic off to loki

373
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,580
why loki why do you have gummy bears stuck to your forehead I don't

374
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:55,780
what the hell I was bored I don't know

375
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:00,580
because they stick that's why

376
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:04,580
Yeah, it's because I touch myself at night.

377
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:08,580
I don't know.

378
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:12,580
It's pretty stuck. Want to eat it off?

379
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:16,580
Oh, that is gross! Oh my god! Such blatant heterosexuality in my home.

380
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,580
Anyways, just so you guys know, because this isn't TV,

381
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,580
Loki's fiance just ate the gummy bear off of his forehead

382
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,580
and like totally licked his forehead in the process. You don't know where that's been.

383
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:36,580
I put worse things in my nose off his body, too.

384
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,580
Do we have a bleeper? Do we have a dump button or a bleeper?

385
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,580
Oh wait, I forgot we're internet.

386
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:49,580
No, so, what did I do this week? Not much. I interviewed for my games position. I did really well.

387
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:50,580
What are you doing?

388
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:58,820
doing? And so, like, what else did I do? Oh, well, I interviewed really well for it, so

389
00:33:58,820 --> 00:34:03,980
I'm going to get it. Yeah. So, that's game sales position and I get to sell games and

390
00:34:03,980 --> 00:34:08,580
I hopefully get free games and that kind of wonderful stuff. It pays more money, so that's

391
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:17,460
all that's good. More presents for me. Yeah, sure. Anyways. Yeah, this one broke her wedding

392
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:24,500
ring engagement ring it was salty craftsmanship do not shop at Zales but

393
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:27,700
they will give you a new ring if you break your other one like a brand new

394
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:33,540
one that's shiny yeah they suck but anyways then we got pretzels and that

395
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,860
was cool I love those goddamn pretzels you just eat them and you want more and

396
00:34:37,860 --> 00:34:43,340
more and all mall pretzels are the shit with like the mustard mrs. fields

397
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:47,220
Pretzel time pretzels are the fucking bomb. You eat them and you're just like,

398
00:34:47,220 --> 00:34:49,940
need more. More. Crack. More.

399
00:34:49,940 --> 00:34:53,260
You can get those huge soft, like, pretzels at Costco.

400
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:57,420
Yeah, they're not the same. Not the same at all. I know, but they're close. They're so good.

401
00:34:57,420 --> 00:35:01,300
It's like, I bought four one time and I ate them all.

402
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:06,100
And when I got full, I waited until I became un-full and I ate them at rest. It's just

403
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:09,700
that good. That's like me and drumsticks. Like the ice cream

404
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,700
I know, they're so good. So then, what else did we do this week?

405
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:17,700
Um, we, uh, let's see here.

406
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:21,700
Got the apartment stuff finalized, so we're going to be moving into our place on the 16th

407
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,700
of next month, and then, um,

408
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:29,700
there's some other stuff I did. Loki and I will no longer be living together

409
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:33,700
as of next month. Freedom! And I'll be, um,

410
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,700
living with Nellie. Aw. Wait a minute,

411
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,700
You're moving in together before you're married?

412
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,700
Sinners living in sin?

413
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:45,700
Whatever.

414
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:47,700
Okay, anyways, so, um...

415
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,700
How did you know the name of our apartment complex?

416
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:52,700
So, um, we're at...

417
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:55,700
My household will be all gay.

418
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,700
Ew!

419
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,700
We should move into, like, the same thing.

420
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,700
Anyway, sorry, we keep cutting Loki off.

421
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,700
Anyways, um...

422
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:06,700
So, I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week, as usual,

423
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:36,680
just because I can't. I would be playing other games, but some person hasn't returned my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so I haven't been able to play that. So I got bored and I bought more games. I bought Dog's Life and Gran Turismo 4, and I must say I can't drive for shit in Gran Turismo 4. I have the first thing you do, and I don't know why people do this, at least I did, is you drive your car. You pick your car in the game, and so I picked my Ford Focus, and guess what?

424
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:43,240
But it sucks! It's not a racecar! Then, then I was playing the rally mode where you basically...

425
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:49,360
Well, as a reminder, you won't afford. Whatever. Anyways, so I was playing, um, the rally mode

426
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:53,920
or whatever, versus, like, they had some, like, really nice Subaru rally car, you know,

427
00:36:53,920 --> 00:37:00,200
versus the boat that I picked, and obviously the rally car beat my boat, and that pissed

428
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:07,200
me off. So, yeah, so, anyways, but I'll talk more about those games on the podcast, which

429
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:14,460
you can download every week. Ha ha! Um, so yeah, I did that, and, um, all I must say,

430
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:22,320
a little teaser for the podcast, I've been throwing poop on cars. Poop on cars. He's

431
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:28,820
not kidding. Not kidding. As a dog, I've taken shits in places I've never known that I could

432
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:35,380
take shits in. And so, it's a very fun game. You gotta seriously try it. And Gran Turismo

433
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:41,620
4, beautiful. Gran Turismo 4 is a sexy game. It looks very sexy. They have, like, this,

434
00:37:41,620 --> 00:37:46,340
like, really, like, operatic, you know, like, music in the beginning, and I'm like, what

435
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:52,180
the hell? But I miss the Cardigans song that was in Gran Turismo 2. They have Crystal Method

436
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:57,020
in this, this game, which is pretty cool. I haven't seen the soundtrack list yet, but

437
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,020
It had some Crystal Method in there, that was kind of neat.

438
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:06,020
And I don't know, it was just fun stuff playing a few sim files.

439
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:11,020
Once again, my wrist was sore from playing Step Mania.

440
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:16,020
Hey, I'm getting better, okay?

441
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:20,020
You know, pretty soon, no, I've got masturbation down.

442
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:22,020
I'm talking about Step Mania.

443
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,020
I'm not worried about that.

444
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:27,140
Oh, he already triple-a'd masturbation, sorry.

445
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:28,140
Exactly.

446
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,600
Oh, by the way, I should mention this, because it was quite funny.

447
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,820
I found out- no, not masturbation.

448
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:37,420
I found out last week my mom was listening to our show.

449
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:41,720
Oh, yeah, maybe I should stop saying- And masturbating?

450
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:46,640
I should stop saying things like that.

451
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:53,780
So Matt- if Matthew's mom is listening, Matthew has never masturbated in his life, and he's

452
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:58,780
She's never looked at a girl with impure thoughts, and he gets straight A's in school.

453
00:38:58,780 --> 00:39:00,780
I'm good at school.

454
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:02,780
Remember that one time she walked in on her?

455
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,780
She's gonna...

456
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:10,780
Oh my God!

457
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:14,780
This is why Nellie doesn't get a microphone on the show.

458
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,780
I still think the mic picked that up, but...

459
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,780
I think it did.

460
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,780
Judging by the reaction.

461
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,780
I am at a loss for words. I just...

462
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,780
You're not listening.

463
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:34,780
I don't know what to say.

464
00:39:34,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Not anymore. She needs my sister to help her, you know, with finding stuff.

465
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,780
She's not in the chat room. She wouldn't even know how to get in the chat room.

466
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:48,780
Seriously, MPQ's got a point. This is why you don't tell your parents what you do on the internet.

467
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:53,060
internet but you know whatever parents find out just like they find out about

468
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:56,060
masturbation they find out about your your radio show on the internet I'm a

469
00:39:56,060 --> 00:40:02,420
freaking adult okay it doesn't matter it's whatever yeah

470
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:05,580
anyways I'm done that's all I did all right

471
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:12,620
Nelly you want to share anything about your week in your day okay before we get

472
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,380
a break we are gonna go to a break pretty soon here but I want to bring up

473
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,860
some news I do want to talk about the money news we'll get to that after the

474
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:23,480
break I want to talk about this because I know a lot of Bahmani nerds are into

475
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:27,780
this series as well and this is definitely worth mentioning but it's

476
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:33,180
been a little a little mention in Nintendo Power a little tiny little slip

477
00:40:33,180 --> 00:40:40,300
in Namco's upcoming calendar says that Katamari Dimash EDS is on the way so

478
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:44,300
something for you guys to think about there and my question is how in the hell

479
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:48,460
are you going to control that? That's going to be weird. Like is it going to be that faux

480
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:54,560
analog thing like Mario 64 has? Well, here's how it's going to work. It's quite simple.

481
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,960
You're going to have, you know, not faux analog, but you're going to have the two directional

482
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:05,060
button and you have your four buttons. Those are your two sticks right there. Either that

483
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:11,100
or you can use the stylus to roll it. You just kind of move the stylus. There you go.

484
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:16,100
Like, you could just keep, like, rolling it forward to the side using the stylus? I guess that would work.

485
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:24,100
It's nice that the DS is going to get a game, you know, because we keep hearing about all this cool stuff that's going to come out on the DS.

486
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:33,100
Dude, I looked out, okay, yesterday when I was at GameStop, looking at games, and then they have, I looked at the wall of all the stuff that's supposed to be launching with the PSP,

487
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:40,100
And then I walked over to the DS section and it was literally half a shelf, not even a shelf, it was a small shelf.

488
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:47,100
They had maybe ten games, maybe, and that was everything that's out right now and I'm like, God the DS sucks.

489
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:52,100
But the thing is that the DS as a system, it doesn't suck, I mean...

490
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:54,100
Well why don't they release some games then?

491
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,100
I don't know, cause they're bastard people, I have no other explanation for that.

492
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:01,100
You know what, other systems did the exact same thing and it failed horribly.

493
00:42:01,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Please don't say un-gauge or I'll hate you forever.

494
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:13,100
No, those both sucked from launch, but I'm talking about Nintendo 64, that failed as a system.

495
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:19,100
And it's because there wasn't that many games out for it. And also, um, Atari Lynx.

496
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:22,100
But, it did have, um, Pokemon Snap.

497
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:25,100
Yeah, Pokemon Dash out right now.

498
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:32,100
DS, the thing about the DS is that it does have a lot of good games. Coming soon. Animal Crossing DS, coming soon.

499
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,100
Oh yeah, it's September.

500
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:36,100
Woo, fun! That's assuming they don't push it back.

501
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,100
I know, I know.

502
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:51,100
See, the problem with DS though is new technology. Not everyone knows how to market for dual screens. Not everyone is willing to take the plunge. I mean, PSP, everyone knows how to do one screen.

503
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Yeah, Castlevania DS will make it all better.

504
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Castlevania DS will be my god when it's out.

505
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,100
I know.

506
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:01,100
Speaking of PSP, is anybody planning on picking one up?

507
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:03,100
I already have ours reserved.

508
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:06,100
Do you guys have a demo in the house because of what your man does?

509
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:08,100
Nobody's got one at the store.

510
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,100
Oh, right on. Has he given you any feedback on it?

511
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:12,100
Said it was fun.

512
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,100
Have you gotten to play it at all yet?

513
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:16,100
Haven't really been all that excited about playing it.

514
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,100
I want a PSP, but I don't want it right now because I just have too much of the shit going on,

515
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:26,980
sucks because I, I wish somebody would just send me a free one. I need Wipeout Pure. There

516
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:33,540
are a lot, oh see, I want Lumines. Oh. I would buy it from Metal Gear Acid. See, all these

517
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:38,540
cool games coming out like right around launch period. And then the DS, like, no, what did

518
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:42,700
we get at launch? We got Mario, which was cool, but it was a rehashed game. Eventually.

519
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:48,380
Spiderman 2. What did he do? Feel the magic. Fun for about 5 minutes. Fun, fun, fun, fun.

520
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:50,380
Mr. Driller DS.

521
00:43:50,380 --> 00:43:52,380
And eventually we're getting some fun stuff.

522
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:55,380
WarioWare Twisted. Sorry, Touched.

523
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,380
Touched is already out. I have Touched.

524
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:58,380
We've finally gotten to that.

525
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,380
Yeah.

526
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:00,380
Okay, so finally.

527
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:03,380
Castlevania DS will be out soon. Supposedly.

528
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,380
Not soon enough. That's my problem.

529
00:44:05,380 --> 00:44:08,380
Wario Kart.

530
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,380
The internet thing I'm excited about too.

531
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:14,380
We can save the general gaming stuff for the podcast.

532
00:44:14,380 --> 00:44:18,340
know but it's worth talking about now I know a lot of you guys are curious about

533
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,340
that kind of stuff and the PSP is pretty big news right now you know with it

534
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:26,220
coming out next week and all I'm just too poor honestly otherwise I would

535
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:29,320
totally get one if I had a lot of money I'd buy one right this week but I'm a

536
00:44:29,320 --> 00:44:35,380
long-term gamer and the battery life thing is still kind of no all right uh

537
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:39,220
we're gonna take a break in this break I promised a Dark Sacker we'd do some

538
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,580
forest-style music so that's exactly we're gonna do and we're gonna start off

539
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:48,440
with empathy because that song is rad. We'll be back after this with more Orange

540
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,920
Lawns Radio and some news on Night Style and you know that kind of involves

541
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:55,260
indirectly some news from Port Style. So we'll be back after this with Orange

542
00:44:55,260 --> 00:45:02,820
That's

543
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:09,880
now

544
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:16,900
out

545
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,900
Love, love, love, love, love

546
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:20,900
A thing to be found, a thing to be found

547
00:49:20,900 --> 00:49:24,900
I'm still not alone, it turns out

548
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:28,900
It's the final countdown

549
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:34,900
The final countdown

550
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:40,900
The final countdown

551
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:45,900
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

552
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:41,900
Why?

553
00:50:41,900 --> 00:50:42,900
Why?

554
00:50:42,900 --> 00:50:43,900
Why?

555
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:44,900
Why?

556
00:50:44,900 --> 00:50:46,900
Why?

557
00:51:46,900 --> 00:51:47,900
Why?

558
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,900
Why?

559
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:49,900
Why?

560
00:51:49,900 --> 00:51:50,900
Why?

561
00:51:50,900 --> 00:51:51,900
Why?

562
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:52,900
Why?

563
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:53,900
Why?

564
00:51:53,900 --> 00:52:03,900
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next video.

565
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:28,400
That's why the Orange Lounge, this media sucks!

566
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:28,900
Holler!

567
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:29,400
Stop!

568
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:29,900
Stop!

569
00:52:29,900 --> 00:52:30,400
Stop!

570
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:30,900
Stop!

571
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:31,900
You are the winner!

572
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:33,900
Exercise PS!

573
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,400
GTPO.

574
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:38,400
Whee!

575
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:42,400
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

576
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:44,400
Whee!

577
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:46,400
Hope you enjoyed that break of four style music.

578
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:52,400
Starting it off with Taku, Empathy, LED, Infinite Prayer, the floating flock style.

579
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,400
believe that was technically a home version track but who cares it's still

580
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,800
cool DJ Taka featuring Jasmine Final Countdown and Ryu with Starmine and

581
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:06,560
Ryu one of those interesting guys because he like had that song in fourth

582
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,400
style then disappeared for a long ass time and then came back and I don't

583
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,780
remember if it was ninth or tenth but he did he disappeared for a while then just

584
00:53:13,780 --> 00:53:17,280
recently came back to the series so hope you enjoyed that stuff from fourth style

585
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:24,880
And, and yes, 2DX Night Style is on people's minds right now because we're actually hearing,

586
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:30,440
as of today, that some folks have already gotten their copies of 2DX Night Style, the

587
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:35,860
home release. So, some of you guys may already be having that version. If not, you're gonna

588
00:53:35,860 --> 00:53:40,840
be getting it very soon. The anticipated release date was the, I believe it was the 23rd, was

589
00:53:40,840 --> 00:53:44,460
the anticipated release date, but it looks like it may actually have hit the internet

590
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:49,540
A wee bit early, so hopefully some of you guys out there may already have been seeing

591
00:53:49,540 --> 00:53:52,900
it. If you haven't though, you're going to be getting that very soon. I know I need to

592
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:58,020
get my copy still, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm poor, so I won't be getting it

593
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:03,460
for a little while. But hopefully soon. Darksecker, I know you usually pick up a lot of the new

594
00:54:03,460 --> 00:54:07,540
2DX styles as they come out. Are you getting this one, or? I know you're not. Yeah, I just

595
00:54:07,540 --> 00:54:11,020
didn't pre-order it. Yeah, I know you're not huge on 9th style, so I don't know if you

596
00:54:11,020 --> 00:54:15,020
maybe passed on it or what? I honestly didn't care about ninth style, but I'm

597
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:20,280
gonna get it. Just to be a perfectionist, right? Or a completionist, I should say.

598
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,740
Yeah, but I'm still missing fourth style. Well, I guess that's true. But fourth style's a

599
00:54:23,740 --> 00:54:28,780
little harder to find. Not really. Really? I thought it was. I can find it. Oh, rad. I just

600
00:54:28,780 --> 00:54:32,580
haven't spent the money on it. But fourth style's gonna be on the back burner

601
00:54:32,580 --> 00:54:38,780
because I have to get Vibrable. Oh. Cool. And I still need to find Moji

602
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:45,620
ribbon but that one's been kind of out hmm let's see four style songs that are

603
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:49,440
coming back into night style there's a lot of repeats if you check out the

604
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:55,720
official night style consumer version website konami studio co dot JP slash bm

605
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:04,080
to the number two DX nine th that's konami studio co dot JP slash bm to dx

606
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:09,840
9th. It actually has a whole big song list, so some of the songs coming back from 4th

607
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:15,920
Style, just some of them, the ones I recognize, Empathy, of course, Kamikaze is coming back.

608
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:20,360
This one is interesting, I think, from 3rd Style, Dong Tepo No. 1, remember that one?

609
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:27,360
I hate that song. That song is hilarious. And Macho Gang by Anal Spider is coming back.

610
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:33,040
I love the hamburger helper video that goes along with that.

611
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:37,620
Some very interesting consumer tracks making their way into the Night Style home

612
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:39,940
version. A couple LED tracks including

613
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:44,660
Jaeger Final Attack and another song called Photo and Genic.

614
00:55:44,660 --> 00:55:49,480
And an LED usually teams up with Groovy but actually Groovy has their own

615
00:55:49,480 --> 00:55:53,140
song featuring Nopla's chin. 5 p.m. Eternal

616
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:58,640
is a song that they have in the night style. So again, for the full list, you can head on over there.

617
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,380
All the brand new night style songs are making their way to the home version.

618
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:06,740
I believe they stopped doing the license thing with night style. At least I haven't

619
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:08,100
noticed anything missing.

620
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:11,580
If there was something missing, then I just didn't notice it.

621
00:56:11,580 --> 00:56:14,860
My only concern is that Bad Boy Bass made it in.

622
00:56:14,860 --> 00:56:20,580
And Bad Boy Bass did make it in, so that was my only concern, because it's my

623
00:56:20,580 --> 00:56:21,660
favorite night style song.

624
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:35,660
So, and then of course I'm sure Lion Ski, for those of you guys that are into Kiriyamaoka and who can blame ya, I'm sure that song also is making its debut along with the video in 9th Style, so good times there for 2DX 9th Style.

625
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,660
Angel, I know you're really into 2DX as well, what are your thoughts on the 9th Style release this week?

626
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:54,660
I want it, but I need to get 8th first, so I'm a little behind. Okay, I'm a lot, well, I'm not that behind. I just need 8th and 9th now, so, you know. Plus, I need to practice more too.

627
00:56:54,660 --> 00:56:57,660
Practice makes perfect.

628
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,660
Uh, Loki, I know you hate 2DX, but any interest in this whatsoever?

629
00:57:03,660 --> 00:57:04,660
Uh, mic's not on, bud.

630
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:07,660
I don't hate 2DX, but uh...

631
00:57:10,660 --> 00:57:12,660
Someone's breaking the mic!

632
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:13,660
Sounds fine.

633
00:57:14,660 --> 00:57:16,660
I know that, but there's pieces of metal jutting out.

634
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:17,660
Oh, yuck.

635
00:57:17,660 --> 00:57:19,660
And uh, the top part's coming off.

636
00:57:19,660 --> 00:57:20,660
Uh oh.

637
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:22,660
Hurray! Anyway.

638
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:39,660
Anyway, my thoughts. It's another game. Yay. Yeah. Hooray. Another 2DX game. And how have they made it any better? Nope, they haven't.

639
00:57:39,660 --> 00:57:46,660
I just want to know about the timing. I want to get some feedback on how the timing is in 9th style, and unfortunately I haven't had the time today to read the message boards.

640
00:57:46,660 --> 00:57:52,660
I'm hoping that when we open up the Skype line later, maybe some folks might already know about if the timing got better from the arcade.

641
00:57:52,660 --> 00:58:03,660
Um, I actually, I want to say we did have somebody was saying, I think it was Siggy or somebody on the Skype line a couple weeks back was saying that the timing is somewhat better, which I hope, I hope is true.

642
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:10,660
is true. Anyway, so that's it for night style. I really don't have a whole lot else to add

643
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:17,060
to that. So, anybody else have any exciting night style related news?

644
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:21,760
I kind of want the deluxe set. What is coming in? I don't even remember

645
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:27,180
what's coming in. It's got a DVD, the v-rare 10, and a sticker

646
00:58:27,180 --> 00:58:35,460
Book. When I saw Sticker Book, I was like, I don't want stickers. I almost bought the

647
00:58:35,460 --> 00:58:42,380
Pop Music 9, the deluxe set. Ooh, that was pretty cool. I wanted a teacup. But I ended

648
00:58:42,380 --> 00:58:47,980
up buying Right Chance instead. You know another song that shows up in Nightstyle Consumer

649
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:54,580
is Number 13 by Taka with Respect for JSB, and that would be one of them preview tracks

650
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:59,620
from a future 2DX style, so that's kinda cool. I'm kinda glad that, um, that, you know, is

651
00:58:59,620 --> 00:59:02,780
showing up. I like seeing preview songs. I'm just glad we're getting more 2DX, but now

652
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:06,500
they need to, uh, start bringing out the, uh, guitar dora. It's weird that they've all

653
00:59:06,500 --> 00:59:10,300
been coming out, like, back to back. Like, we went years with no 2DX at home and then

654
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:15,140
suddenly, bam, seventh, eighth, now ninth. Oops, we fucked up! And you know that if this

655
00:59:15,140 --> 00:59:18,340
does well, which I assume it will, because it's got a pretty big following here in the

656
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:24,620
States 10th will be out probably by the end of summer which is rock because 10th

657
00:59:24,620 --> 00:59:29,420
style is pretty cool too I have to have my Gradius remember back in the day when

658
00:59:29,420 --> 00:59:34,980
they're like we don't make you seven style unless you vote and if you buy or

659
00:59:34,980 --> 00:59:38,780
else we don't make yes I remember that that they were saying I know they're

660
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:45,860
like oh you like you fight again we make more for you thank you thank you for

661
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:55,740
that. You can address those cards and letters to matt at orangelandradio.com, by the way.

662
00:59:55,740 --> 00:59:59,580
You know, I just, I kind of hope that they're still going to come out in the arcade as well,

663
00:59:59,580 --> 01:00:04,300
like 2DX Red. I still haven't gotten a chance to play Red, but I'm kind of hoping to when

664
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:08,920
I get to go down to LA in a couple of weeks. So, we'll see. And then, hopefully, that'll

665
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:12,700
be out for home by early next year. So, at the rate things are going, that would be pretty

666
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:24,700
Cool. I don't know. Do you think there's any room for 2DX to evolve in the near future or be, I guess I should say, maybe not necessarily 2DX, but Beatmania? Even though Beatmania, the five-

667
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:26,700
50 key.

668
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:32,700
Been there, done that. Keyboardmania doubles. Hello.

669
01:00:32,700 --> 01:00:34,700
They can come with an ice cream dispenser.

670
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:36,700
Typing of the beat.

671
01:00:36,700 --> 01:00:38,700
They did that. Remember that?

672
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,700
Beatmania, dah, dah, dah.

673
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:42,700
Duh duh duh.

674
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,700
Exactly. Dot dot dot is all I heard. I heard it was total crap too.

675
01:00:46,700 --> 01:00:49,700
I like that loopin' typing game.

676
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:52,700
I don't play that. I have typing of the dead at home.

677
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,700
I'm sad that there was not any more keyboard manias that came out.

678
01:00:57,700 --> 01:00:59,700
Speaking of 50 key.

679
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:00,700
I like keyboard manias.

680
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:03,700
Whatever happened to Para Para? Or Dance Maniacs for that matter.

681
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,700
Because the Para Para craze has died down in Japan.

682
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:11,700
Yeah, I heard rumors that Velfire just ain't what it used to be.

683
01:01:11,700 --> 01:01:18,700
Well, Velfire was a club, just a regular club anyway, that had, as far as I'm aware, just did pada-pada on certain nights.

684
01:01:18,700 --> 01:01:19,700
Right.

685
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:22,700
I don't have anything to add to that.

686
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:23,700
I'm so going to go there.

687
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:31,700
I wish that, I think it would be hilarious that if like in San Francisco or something there was actually a bar where they did that as well, I just think that would be hilarious.

688
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:35,700
I mean, if people can fucking country line dance, why can't they, pa-ra-pa? Seriously?

689
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:37,700
You look just as stupid doing either one.

690
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:39,700
Maybe it's just me?

691
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,700
Patapata, though, is kinda cool. It's like cheerleading, though.

692
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:44,700
Kind of.

693
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:49,700
It's all happy! And not boot scootin'.

694
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:55,700
Like, I go to karaoke and some lesbian will get up there and start singing a country song, like, you know,

695
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,700
Don't break my heart, Mike. No, I'm just kidding. Nobody sings that.

696
01:01:58,700 --> 01:01:59,700
But, like, they'll sing Dixie Chicks or something.

697
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,700
And people start country line dancing, and I'm like, that's so weird.

698
01:02:03,700 --> 01:02:07,700
I don't know why. I shouldn't hate, but it's weird.

699
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:11,700
There's the straights! Get him!

700
01:02:11,700 --> 01:02:15,700
And it makes perfect sense. Gay people

701
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:19,700
don't line dance. It's documented in books.

702
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:23,700
In their natural habitat?

703
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:27,700
Yes.

704
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:31,700
Oh, Dark Tetsuya in our chatroom is so winter. Square Dance Revolution. I would love to see that game.

705
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:37,340
that game. No, I did square dancing in fourth grade and it sucked. Everybody, didn't everybody

706
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,420
do square dancing in high school? Like in December when it started raining you would

707
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:47,380
have to do square dancing for two weeks? Believe it or not, not in Alabama. Really? Now that's

708
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:51,340
surprising. I would think that square dancing would be like a whole class in Alabama that

709
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:58,340
you could take for units. Just teasing. I know. You know what you can do with that finger.

710
01:02:58,340 --> 01:03:00,340
I have plenty of ideas.

711
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,340
Pleasure a sheep?

712
01:03:06,340 --> 01:03:08,340
Hit him please.

713
01:03:08,340 --> 01:03:10,340
Cause I can't.

714
01:03:12,340 --> 01:03:14,340
That's solid metal.

715
01:03:14,340 --> 01:03:16,340
That's the idea.

716
01:03:16,340 --> 01:03:18,340
Oh, it's hot.

717
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,340
Alright.

718
01:03:20,340 --> 01:03:22,340
Anyway.

719
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,340
Let's talk about other Vivani news going on out there right now.

720
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:31,660
this is pretty big deal than making the rounds of all the sites. All the big dinner sites

721
01:03:31,660 --> 01:03:35,180
have this news going on right now because of course they get a little kick back if you

722
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:42,700
answer this call. In the Groove is officially taking pre-orders while the game does not

723
01:03:42,700 --> 01:03:49,740
have an official release date yet, they're saying summer 2005 quote unquote. There is

724
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:57,980
pre-order bonus that you can get an in the groove soundtrack an in the groove

725
01:03:57,980 --> 01:04:05,100
t-shirt red octane temporary tattoo so you can be cool you put on that name put

726
01:04:05,100 --> 01:04:09,660
on that red octane tattoo and go to the Harley Davidson bar and show how cool

727
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:16,980
you are a red octane keychain you know this this is like crap that they made

728
01:04:16,980 --> 01:04:20,900
that they tried to give away at conventions, and it couldn't go anywhere, and they're like,

729
01:04:20,900 --> 01:04:24,820
what are we gonna do with all this crap? I know, let's give it away, woo!

730
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:31,940
And free shipping. And of course, as expected, there will be an In the Groove bundle,

731
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,940
which will be the game and an ignition pad. Will it be as glitchy as the arcade?

732
01:04:37,460 --> 01:04:39,380
I'm not sure. Is that one of the features?

733
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:44,020
I'm not sure. You know what I figured out about In the Groove for the first time when I was playing

734
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:48,140
if you actually sit and you watch the Attract Mode

735
01:04:48,140 --> 01:04:51,700
it actually shows pictures of all the people who made the game

736
01:04:51,700 --> 01:04:55,340
and then pictures of all these people gathered up in the arcade

737
01:04:55,340 --> 01:04:59,160
Like I saw AID on the break in there and I was like, oh I

738
01:04:59,160 --> 01:04:59,960
played that machine, that's kinda neat

739
01:04:59,960 --> 01:05:03,420
it was kinda neat in a way, but at the same time I was kinda like

740
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:07,440
WOW, these guys credit themselves as step chart makers

741
01:05:07,440 --> 01:05:10,860
they credit themselves in the credits of the game

742
01:05:10,860 --> 01:05:13,820
They credit themselves in the opening sequence of the game.

743
01:05:13,820 --> 01:05:18,140
Not that, okay, not that, you know, you shouldn't get a little credit because

744
01:05:18,140 --> 01:05:20,140
these games take a lot of work, but

745
01:05:20,140 --> 01:05:24,620
I don't know, it seems like most other games I've played have

746
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:28,820
a little bit of a, a little bit of a hold warm

747
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:31,860
when it comes to that stuff. A little less, not so much.

748
01:05:31,860 --> 01:05:37,180
I don't know. Not, I don't, I don't, I'm gonna get the hate mail.

749
01:05:37,180 --> 01:05:41,180
I'm not dogging on In The Group. I'm actually starting to warm up to the game a little bit.

750
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:45,180
I'm finding like the five songs I really like to play over and over again.

751
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:49,180
So, you know, I'm having a good time. And my scores are getting better.

752
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:53,180
I'm getting used to that wacky scrolling thing, the way it scrolls initially.

753
01:05:53,180 --> 01:05:56,180
Angel, you had to play In The Group for the first time this week. What did you think?

754
01:05:56,180 --> 01:06:00,180
I suck. I suck bad. I don't know.

755
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:04,180
I find the arrows like really small for, you know,

756
01:06:04,180 --> 01:06:10,740
the way, because I can't see that well and just you know having small arrows kind of makes it hard

757
01:06:10,740 --> 01:06:17,460
so I had to follow by color which doesn't exactly work but um I figure with practice I will

758
01:06:18,340 --> 01:06:25,300
try to get better at the game assuming we get to go again so other than that I mean

759
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,980
you know I didn't know any of the music or anything so that didn't help and you know Rob

760
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:33,220
was like pick a song pick a song I'm like I don't know what I want to play just pick one

761
01:06:33,220 --> 01:06:34,540
you know, so

762
01:06:34,540 --> 01:06:37,260
I guess uh...

763
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:41,960
as I play the game I'll get to know the songs and I'll feel a little bit more comfortable with it

764
01:06:41,960 --> 01:06:43,340
but other than that, yeah

765
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,140
it's okay

766
01:06:45,140 --> 01:06:49,020
it's still a rip-off, but it's still okay

767
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:53,300
uh, Andrew, you got to play it for the first time as well, what were your thoughts on Indigo Groove?

768
01:06:53,300 --> 01:06:54,980
I thought it was uh... pretty well done

769
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,940
uh...

770
01:06:56,940 --> 01:06:59,180
did seem a little bit glitchy

771
01:06:59,180 --> 01:07:00,620
but

772
01:07:00,620 --> 01:07:06,060
Actually it plays like a finished product. Now glitchy is a very vague word. What do you mean with glitchy?

773
01:07:06,060 --> 01:07:09,340
Just some basic timing stuff

774
01:07:09,340 --> 01:07:12,580
because I was listening to the songs and just some

775
01:07:12,580 --> 01:07:16,220
steps just didn't match. So it mostly could be just a step chart problem.

776
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:20,860
Well now that's a step chart glitch. Could be just step charts to me but

777
01:07:20,860 --> 01:07:25,860
it actually plays like a finished product.

778
01:07:25,860 --> 01:07:28,740
But then I went back and I played DDR and you know what's weird?

779
01:07:28,740 --> 01:07:33,180
The DDR machine is only about half as loud as the In The Groove machine.

780
01:07:33,180 --> 01:07:36,740
The two machines are right next to each other. I got on DDR and I played

781
01:07:36,740 --> 01:07:39,780
and I got like a huge crowd watching me play DDR.

782
01:07:39,780 --> 01:07:42,780
In The Groove, maybe a couple people, but DDR...

783
01:07:42,780 --> 01:07:45,220
It doesn't have the same appeal, it doesn't have the name recognition.

784
01:07:45,220 --> 01:07:49,220
Not that I'm like huge, but I always thought to the standard

785
01:07:49,220 --> 01:07:54,140
just patron of an arcade, a teenager, they're all the same.

786
01:07:54,140 --> 01:07:57,860
You know, that's always why. Maybe I'm not giving the average user of the arcade enough

787
01:07:57,860 --> 01:07:58,480
credit,

788
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:01,660
but I always thought every dance game was the same to most people that aren't in

789
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:02,340
this scene

790
01:08:02,340 --> 01:08:08,220
but I you will be yours here's what I've always said one leg up the DER house on

791
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:08,820
in the group

792
01:08:08,820 --> 01:08:11,840
does in the group have more challenging steps yes does it have a

793
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:15,460
very song list for folks that may be into them

794
01:08:15,460 --> 01:08:20,260
will music in the group offers yes does it have more features than the ER yes

795
01:08:20,260 --> 01:08:23,340
but it's not quite as pretty

796
01:08:23,340 --> 01:08:28,460
it's very industrial looking the game has a very like industrial theme to

797
01:08:28,460 --> 01:08:34,780
to it, a lot of like metal and fire and all that stuff. Whereas DDR is happy! It's candy!

798
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:41,300
It's saccharin! And I don't know, I think that attracts people to it more. In a completely

799
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:45,380
superficial way. It brings people out of the dark shadows that are with their lives. Another

800
01:08:45,380 --> 01:08:51,940
thing is, it looked very plain. Very plain. I mean, just even the arrows are plain. The

801
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:57,220
interface is plain. It's just plain. I mean, whereas you can get some interfaces, like

802
01:08:57,220 --> 01:09:03,220
Like, a lot of the step mania skins I've seen out there, they're really cool looking, and they're really, you know, complex looking.

803
01:09:03,220 --> 01:09:07,220
They're really, you know, like, wow, I gotta play that game, it looks cool.

804
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:13,220
Versus, wow, it's another dancing game, yay.

805
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:22,220
Wow, we gotta include all this crap to get you to buy this game, because we're gonna fail when it comes to selling against, you know, DDR.

806
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:24,940
people are going to buy this game because they'll be like, oh, I got to put it in the

807
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:32,700
group so they make more games. It's just, no. It's, whatever. I'm very curious to see

808
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:38,380
how it plays. I'm curious to see how it plays out, too, because I think it is going to be

809
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,820
competition. We got into this a couple weeks ago. I don't want to revisit, but I think

810
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:47,100
the Red Octane partnership is going to prove it's going to make In the Groove some serious

811
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:51,620
competition. I really do. And I think the game is good enough, certainly, where it can

812
01:09:51,620 --> 01:09:56,160
post a cut it's not like we're talking it's mad cats dance craze or whatever

813
01:09:56,160 --> 01:10:00,960
that fucking game was on GameCube that sucks it's it's a good dance game does

814
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:09,160
it have flaws yeah but is it good is it solid surprisingly so so we'll see we

815
01:10:09,160 --> 01:10:16,160
shall see okay well I'm getting blink blink blinks I don't know what I guess

816
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:20,160
we'll do a break time then we'll come back maybe do some skype line how's that

817
01:10:20,160 --> 01:10:24,160
sound. Let our listeners talk back. Good work. Alright, we'll do that. So we're gonna go

821
01:10:39,640 --> 01:10:45,040
to play. And we're gonna start it off with, since we've been doing 2DX all night, I think

822
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:53,200
it's time to do some DDR oh wow I will get that in there Jamie let's start it

823

826
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:11,600
Okay, forget Blue Impulse, then. We'll do this.

827
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:13,600
Let them move.

828
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,600
No, except let them move, because that song's been banned.

829
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:16,600
Alright.

830
01:11:16,600 --> 01:11:18,600
Bye, baby, Blue Balloon.

831
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:20,600
I think that song's been banned, too.

832
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:21,600
Yeah, banned.

833
01:11:21,600 --> 01:11:23,600
So we're gonna do a break of songs we hate?

834
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:24,600
Yeah.

835
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:25,600
Okay.

836
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:27,600
Um...

837
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,600
You gotta give me a minute to queue these up.

838
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:30,600
Okay, so what song are we starting off with?

839
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:31,600
Come on.

840
01:11:31,600 --> 01:11:32,600
Sorry.

841
01:11:32,600 --> 01:11:33,600
Bag.

842
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:35,600
I finished the bag of gummy bears.

843
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:36,600
Did you now?

844
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,600
It's gone. I gotta get more.

845
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,600
How long did that take, a month?

846
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:43,600
Not even, like a couple, like a week or so.

847
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:44,600
Two weeks, in fact.

848
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,600
Two weeks.

849
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:46,600
I only have-

850
01:11:46,600 --> 01:11:47,600
How do you impress them?

851
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,600
Two weeks!

852
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:51,600
Strangely enough, I only have bag from the nonstop.

853
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:53,600
You know what's really scary?

854
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:54,600
I guess we'll do it.

855
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:55,600
What?

856
01:11:55,600 --> 01:11:57,600
They played Junior today on sci-fi.

857
01:11:57,600 --> 01:11:58,600
Oh, anyway.

858
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,600
We'll be back after this, a break of Ditter Songs We Hate.

859
01:12:01,600 --> 01:12:02,600
We'll be back.

860
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:09,600
back.

861
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:24,240
Sweatin' hub, just waitin' out for Sweatin'

862
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:31,240
Okay, challenging move.

863
01:13:54,240 --> 01:13:57,240
Get to the bed, to the bed, get to the fever

864
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:00,240
I'm kickin' the posers and nobody's home

865
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:04,240
When I come I'm runnin' down to town, runnin' down to town

866
01:14:05,240 --> 01:14:07,240
Get right down to a ship

867
01:14:08,240 --> 01:14:11,240
In one, two, three, four, come on y'all

868
01:14:12,240 --> 01:14:13,240
I get on with more

869
01:14:14,240 --> 01:14:15,240
Get right down, get right down to a ship

870
01:14:16,240 --> 01:14:18,240
Round and round, move like a finger

871
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:22,240
Come down to a sweet banana, get to the fever

872
01:14:52,240 --> 01:15:18,360
Blow my whistle, baby Blow my whistle, baby

873
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:27,360
Open up, put it in, let's begin

874
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:42,360
So it's like you mean it's lost

875
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:56,360
Black, black, let me hear you speak

876
01:15:56,360 --> 01:16:10,360
Louder, let me hear you say Louder, is that what you call loud?

877
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:16,360
Come on, let me hear you say Let me hear you say

878
01:16:16,360 --> 01:16:25,360
Louder, I said louder You need to bring the beat back

879
01:17:25,360 --> 01:17:29,520
The

880
01:17:29,520 --> 01:17:33,520
the

881
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:37,520
the

882
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:41,520
the

883
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:45,520
the

884
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,520
the

885
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:53,520
the

886
01:17:53,520 --> 01:18:18,840
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

887
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:19,840
Nooooooo!

888
01:18:19,840 --> 01:18:22,200
Just kidding.

889
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:26,920
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

890
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:30,160
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

891
01:18:30,160 --> 01:18:33,800
OK, now I told you that, at least I told the chat room,

892
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:37,200
that we would have a good reason for why we hate all those songs.

893
01:18:37,200 --> 01:18:40,080
Because a lot of people are like, I like this song.

894
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:41,600
I like that song.

895
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,160
You guys are mean.

896
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:45,400
You said it was going to be a bad music break.

897
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:46,520
Bad, bad, bad.

898
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:48,360
Pretty bad to me.

899
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:56,760
Okay, reason number one for bag. Why I hate bag. Bag is a horde song. People play bag

900
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:01,740
to death because it's a ten footer and they'll play it on three speed and then when they

901
01:19:01,740 --> 01:19:06,760
pass it they're like, oh my god, I passed a ten footer. And also because of the way

902
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:11,620
the song sounds, it's one of those songs you can hear from across the arcade when somebody's

903
01:19:11,620 --> 01:19:18,240
play it and it's like oh god somebody's trying to get it you know pass a 10

904
01:19:18,240 --> 01:19:22,400
footer over there even real bagpipe music when you're standing next to the

905
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:28,600
pipest yes the Piper sorry does not sound as annoying I love bagpipe music

906
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,880
not when I'm standing right next to the Piper because then it's deafening mm-hmm

907
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:37,040
but I would rather go deaf from listening to real bagpipes now the weird

908
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:42,140
Another thing about Bag, I actually really like it in 2DX, so I can't explain that one

909
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:45,880
at all, because I actually really like playing that song on 2DX, so that means, you know,

910
01:19:45,880 --> 01:19:48,960
I'm gonna get to play it with 9 style and everything, but I don't like that song in

911
01:19:48,960 --> 01:19:53,880
DDR at all. Maybe it's because it's not as horrid in 2DX? I don't know, I can't explain

912
01:19:53,880 --> 01:19:57,680
it, because it's an easy 2DX song, I guess? I think it was, I think it was like a 6, I

913
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:05,480
don't remember. What else? Changma, Love This Feelin'. Okay, that song's actually not that

914
01:20:05,480 --> 01:20:10,120
bad. I mean, it's one of those songs I used to hate a long time ago, but I know I warmed

915
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,640
up to it. And Jamie, you were saying, you think that song is okay too?

916
01:20:12,640 --> 01:20:17,760
I used to play that song when the only DDR I had was 2nd Mix on Dreamcast. I used to

917
01:20:17,760 --> 01:20:21,240
play that song for the sole purpose of irritating the shit out of people, and then I started

918
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,400
to really like it. Here's the thing about that song. As far as

919
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:30,280
I know, and correct me if I'm wrong on this statement, I'm sure the chat room will, but

920
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:36,680
But I believe it was the first DDR song that had a tempo change.

921
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:40,960
And now, tempo changes are really horrid in DDR.

922
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:45,640
Like I was playing UltraMix 2 online today, I was playing some Controller Controller Revolution,

923
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:51,120
but just to cover my ass here, I specifically looked for a room on UltraMix that said Controller

924
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:57,240
Fun so that we would be playing with controller people so I wouldn't be playing with pad people.

925
01:20:57,240 --> 01:21:01,880
And I just realized, my god, there's a ton of songs with tempo changes now, like it is

926
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,960
such a horrid thing now.

927
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:09,360
So for that, I don't know why, but I blame Love This Feelin' for all my tempo change

928
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,360
woes.

929
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:14,760
Don't get me wrong, tempo changes can be good once in a while, but they're kinda horrid

930
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:15,760
lately.

931
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:20,720
Uh, DJ Alligator Project, the Whistle Song.

932
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,040
I hate that song so much.

933
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,760
Again, it's just Hoard.

934
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,300
And the song is Blow My Whistle, Bitch.

935
01:21:29,300 --> 01:21:32,620
And I don't like the fact that they censored it in the actual song.

936
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:34,160
They didn't censor the background.

937
01:21:34,160 --> 01:21:36,800
It still says Blow My Whistle, Bitch, but they censored the song.

938
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:42,000
Actually, they have both versions on his album, because I have his album.

939
01:21:42,000 --> 01:21:43,000
The vinyl.

940
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,620
Oh my god, why?

941
01:21:45,620 --> 01:21:47,240
Because I was collecting DDR music.

942
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:48,240
Alright, whatever.

943
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,900
I suppose I can play that slide.

944
01:21:50,900 --> 01:21:51,980
But that's another one of those songs.

945
01:21:51,980 --> 01:21:56,100
you can hear it from across the arcade and I swear to god you could be sitting over on

946
01:21:56,100 --> 01:22:06,100
like Derby Owners Club or something you can hear it's like oh god somebody shot off the

947
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:15,480
machine now what the only thing would be fun to play like bag two that's final furlong

948
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:25,520
And then we played Max 300, because that song is so, so horrid. And not just the song itself

949
01:22:25,520 --> 01:22:30,600
when it's played, but all the remixes of Max 300. Because of all the crappy remixes out

950
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:33,840
there of Max 300, we are dubbing Max 300 a bad song.

951
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,720
What about Max Period? That one?

952
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:41,000
Yeah. Oh, God, we should have played that one, too. We could have just done a break

953
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:44,000
of Max music and probably had, you know?

954
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:55,400
think I would have like exploded nevermind all right as promised we are

955
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,600
going to open up the skype line for those of you guys that want to give a

also, there's a test number you can call as well. It's like test 123 or something like

963
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:39,340
that and then you call the test number and then you can hear yourself. Yeah, so that's

964
01:23:39,340 --> 01:23:40,340
That's always a good one to do.

965
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:41,340
Echo 123.

966
01:23:41,340 --> 01:23:42,340
Oh, sorry.

967
01:23:42,340 --> 01:23:43,340
Echo 123.

968
01:23:43,340 --> 01:23:44,340
Okay.

969
01:23:44,340 --> 01:23:45,340
So, anyway.

970
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:46,340
We do have a call.

971
01:23:46,340 --> 01:23:47,340
Hi.

972
01:23:47,340 --> 01:23:48,340
You're on Orange Launch Radio.

973
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:49,340
Hey, Sky.

974
01:23:49,340 --> 01:23:50,340
Siggy here.

975
01:23:50,340 --> 01:23:51,340
Hello, Siggy.

976
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:52,340
How are you?

977
01:23:52,340 --> 01:23:53,340
Just woke up, as usual.

978
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:54,340
Good morning.

979
01:23:54,340 --> 01:23:56,100
So, you must be pretty excited about the ninth style coming out this week.

980
01:23:56,100 --> 01:23:57,380
Oh, hell yes.

981
01:23:57,380 --> 01:23:59,020
And the early release news?

982
01:23:59,020 --> 01:24:00,020
That's pretty exciting.

983
01:24:00,020 --> 01:24:05,700
Well, according to Play Asia, they released it by today in Hong Kong.

984
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:06,880
Oh.

985
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:07,880
Very interesting.

986
01:24:07,880 --> 01:24:08,880
Okay.

987
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:11,880
The release date is March 21st, which is tomorrow.

988
01:24:13,880 --> 01:24:19,880
But before I get into the 9th style business, I just want to say some local news here in Vegas.

989
01:24:19,880 --> 01:24:25,880
Sure, we appreciate local news, because we talk about Sacramento way too much on this show, so we need to hear from other communities.

990
01:24:25,880 --> 01:24:26,880
So what's up in Vegas?

991
01:24:26,880 --> 01:24:29,880
Yeah, um, how should I say it?

992
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,880
Circus Circus Adventure Jones is going to get 2DX Red by tomorrow.

993
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:52,880
Oh, my, that's very interesting. Now, I usually stay at Circus Circus when I go to Vegas, because it's fucking cheap, and so I've been to the Adventure Dome, um, God, I think that was one of the first place, actually the first place I ever played DDR was Circus Circus, but it wasn't in the Adventure Dome, it was in the arcade they had there.

994
01:24:52,880 --> 01:24:53,880
Midway.

995
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:58,880
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the Midway area. Huh, so they're getting 2DX Red, huh?

996
01:24:58,880 --> 01:24:59,880
Yep.

997
01:24:59,880 --> 01:25:04,880
And the Adventure Dome, that's so weird to me. What caused them to decide to jump there?

998
01:25:04,880 --> 01:25:06,880
Have they been successful with 8 style?

999
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:11,880
Well, it's probably the locals. The locals have been demanding it.

1000
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Hmm. Interesting. We'll have to let us know how that goes.

1001
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:18,880
Yeah, sure thing. I'll take pictures.

1002
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:21,880
Woo hoo! Anything else to share with Vegas scene?

1003
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:23,880
Oh, that's only about it.

1004
01:25:23,880 --> 01:25:31,880
There's already some news about getting In The Groove here in Vegas. I don't know which arcade.

1005
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:39,880
Hmm. Well, you know with In The Groove 2 coming out just around the corner, maybe you guys ought to hold off at this point. Who knows?

1006
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,880
I'm not an In The Groove person, so...

1007
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,880
Yeah, I know. I know how it is. I feel your pain.

1008
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:47,880
Yeah, let's get into night style.

1009
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:48,880
Alright, let's.

1010
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:56,880
I'm gonna post a link to a website that has pictures of night style in it.

1011
01:25:56,880 --> 01:26:01,880
Ooh, alright, so you can read that in our chat room, www.orangestonesradio.com, click on chat.

1012
01:26:01,880 --> 01:26:03,880
There's the link, I just saw it pop up.

1013
01:26:03,880 --> 01:26:11,880
What's interesting about night style CS is, you know, the main menu is actually mode select.

1014
01:26:11,880 --> 01:26:13,880
You know, the arcade mode select.

1015
01:26:13,880 --> 01:26:16,880
Hold on, I'm trying to bring it up myself over here right now.

1016
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:20,880
Oh, oh, this is weird because all the pictures are on its side.

1017
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:23,880
Yeah, you're gonna head tilt, tilt your head.

1018
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:24,880
I'm gonna tilt my monitor here.

1019
01:26:24,880 --> 01:26:27,880
Alright, so the main select screen is, uh...

1020
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:28,880
Mode select.

1021
01:26:28,880 --> 01:26:29,880
Mode select, that's kind of weird.

1022
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:33,880
Alright, uh, here's the actual picture of it.

1023
01:26:33,880 --> 01:26:37,880
Let me, uh, paste it to...

1024
01:26:37,880 --> 01:26:38,880
Oh, here it is.

1025
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:41,880
Okay.

1026
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,880
Got it.

1027
01:26:46,880 --> 01:26:49,880
That's the main screen, huh, when you turn on the game?

1028
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:51,880
Oh, wow.

1029
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:54,880
Okay, so the main menu screen has various options on it.

1030
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:56,880
Free, training, original, gallery.

1031
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:59,880
Kind of what you're used to seeing, but the way it's set up,

1032
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,880
it almost looks like you're just jumping right into the game.

1033
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,880
There's really no, you know, fancy...

1034
01:27:04,880 --> 01:27:08,880
Like, I don't know, like, sixth-style kind of had its own fancy menu.

1035
01:27:08,880 --> 01:27:10,880
Wow, that sounds rushed.

1036
01:27:10,880 --> 01:27:13,880
Well, at least we're getting it. I mean, I can't complain.

1037
01:27:13,880 --> 01:27:17,880
Well, at least we're getting it. Oh, at least that car has three of its wheels!

1038
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:19,880
Shut up.

1039
01:27:19,880 --> 01:27:21,880
Alright, so that's interesting.

1040
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:27,880
Yeah. And, uh, on the music list on the official Nine Style CS website, on the very bottom, it says that

1041
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:35,880
Number 13, uh, Beyond the Earth and, uh, Sakuretsu, Jega, Denko, Chup, or Jega Final Attack

1042
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:37,880
are three unlovable stars.

1043
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,880
You're like me.

1044
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:50,880
Okay, that's cool. I like, I was surprised by the number 13. I guess I'd heard the thing, I think you had mentioned a couple weeks ago, but you know, to see that officially, that was pretty neat.

1045
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:51,880
Mm-hmm.

1046
01:27:51,880 --> 01:27:57,880
So, and then I'm interested to hear the new Jaeger. Have the MP3s leaked to the internet yet?

1047
01:27:57,880 --> 01:27:58,880
Uh, nope.

1048
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,880
It's only a matter of time, my friend.

1049
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,880
Yeah, probably within this week or next week.

1050
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:07,880
Yeah, it's only a matter of time. I'm sure Bamani's style will have them up and you can spend your tokens.

1051
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:17,880
As soon as we can get our grubby little paws on him, we're going to start checking the file shares, because here's the real way to get MP3s before anybody else has them.

1052
01:28:17,880 --> 01:28:22,880
Get on the file shares, like the ones that are popular in Asia, like WinMX and stuff, and sometimes you can find them on there.

1053
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:28,880
Like, that's how we got 10-style MP3s pretty quick, was file shares. So, just a thought. If our listeners care.

1054
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:37,880
Yeah, I'm quite happy that some songs that made it, you know, that made a comeback on 9th Style CS, for example, like Empathy.

1055
01:28:37,880 --> 01:28:51,880
I was a little surprised by the comeback list, too. There were some, there were some good things in it, and then there were songs like V, where I'm like, goddamn, do we need V again? I'm done with V, I'm over V.

1056
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:57,880
Yeah, I never, you know, I never played a Kamikaze before.

1057
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:02,920
before oh that's a fun one it's it's got um that's the one isn't that the one

1058
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:07,520
that slows down suddenly and then like speeds up I remember that was one of the

1059
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:22,880
first songs I saw in 2dx was that song oh god that song is hot you just wanted

1060
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:26,440
to say that so you could pronounce it and show your little yeah Japanese

1061
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:31,760
accent there huh no I I love that song and I saw it's awesome or it's like as I

01:29:43,320 --> 01:29:48,280

1066
01:29:48,280 --> 01:29:51,280
Manatsu no Hana, Manatsu no Yume, Baisana, ugh, another song, so...

1067
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:53,280
Ganjutai!

1068
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,280
I'm sorry, I just...

1069
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:02,280
Take it as a compliment, take it as a compliment that I'm just, I'm doing the blinking thing, I can't understand, I'm sorry.

1070
01:30:02,280 --> 01:30:04,280
Alright.

1071
01:30:04,280 --> 01:30:07,280
Well, are you gonna call us next week and let us know what you think about it?

1072
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,280
Alright, yeah, I'll call you next week.

1073
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:13,280
Alright, do that, cause we're poor, so we have to live vicariously through other folks.

1074
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,280
But I'm hoping Jamie will have it soon and she'll bring it over and let us all play.

1075
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:21,680
If I get it, I'll have my birthday next month.

1076
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:22,680
I just said I'm poor.

1077
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:23,680
Don't be looking at me.

1078
01:30:23,680 --> 01:30:24,680
I wasn't.

1079
01:30:24,680 --> 01:30:25,680
I know.

1080
01:30:25,680 --> 01:30:26,680
I know.

1081
01:30:26,680 --> 01:30:27,680
Alright.

1082
01:30:27,680 --> 01:30:28,680
Okay, well thanks for the call, Siggy.

1083
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:29,680
I hope you have a good one.

1084
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,680
Yeah.

1085
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:31,680
Alright.

1086
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:32,680
Later.

1087
01:30:32,680 --> 01:30:34,600
Always good to hear from Siggy.

1088
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:38,680
I think what we will do since we're running past a little bit after 8 o'clock, what we're

1089
01:30:38,680 --> 01:30:41,320
going to do is we're going to go ahead and shut the Skyplane down for now.

1090
01:30:41,320 --> 01:30:46,120
We will open it back up right after the cage match and take some more calls.

1091
01:30:46,120 --> 01:30:50,380
first we are going to get into tonight's cage match and remember this is

1092
01:30:50,380 --> 01:30:53,080
something we do every week here on orange launch radio if you want to

1093
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,400
participate in the cage match you've got to be in our chat room otherwise

1094
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:03,280
$5 no you don't have to send us $5 don't listen to Loki it's all free

1095
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:07,000
you gotta be in our chat room to vote that's the way it works so let's get

1096
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:14,620
into it and last week's cage match we had a brand new winner again we've had a

1097
01:31:14,620 --> 01:31:18,780
a couple of one week victories lately. Let's see if this one will win for one week or if

1098
01:31:18,780 --> 01:31:25,940
it will hold on. It was a remix of an old school 90's song, What is Love by Haddaway.

1099
01:31:25,940 --> 01:31:33,100
It's What is Love Reloaded. So, we'll see what you guys think about this one. You did

1100
01:31:33,100 --> 01:31:37,020
vote it as your winner last week. You may vote it again tonight or you may not. It's

1101
01:31:37,020 --> 01:31:42,620
up to you guys. As a reminder, we only play a clip of the first song because you got to

1102
01:31:42,620 --> 01:31:46,920
to hear the song in its entirety last week, and we want to let this segment only take

1103
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:52,560
up a little bit of time. It doesn't have to take up all day. So, anyway, that all being

1104
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:56,360
said and done, get in our chat room so you can vote. Remember, you cannot vote until

1105
01:31:56,360 --> 01:32:04,780
all songs have played in their entirety. And that being said, let's get into song number

1106
01:32:04,780 --> 01:32:12,460
one it's had away with what is love reloaded enjoy

1107
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:09,980
Why you're not there? I give you my love but you don't care

1108
01:33:09,980 --> 01:33:15,580
So what is right and what is wrong? Give me a sign

1109
01:33:15,580 --> 01:33:22,380
What is love? Oh baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1110
01:33:23,980 --> 01:33:29,180
Oh baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1111
01:33:29,180 --> 01:33:31,180
What is love?

1112
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,180
What is love?

1113
01:33:33,180 --> 01:34:02,780
Alright, that was song number one.

1114
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:09,140
week's winner, Haddaway! What is love? We shall see if it wins again tonight or if it

1115
01:34:09,140 --> 01:34:15,460
will bow down to one of our two other entries tonight, starting off with Loki's pick! And

1116
01:34:15,460 --> 01:34:18,020
Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1117
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:28,540
I picked our fellow friend and Bimani artist, Midihead. He released an exclusive track to

1118
01:34:28,540 --> 01:34:31,140
of people that bought his album

1119
01:34:31,140 --> 01:34:33,460
and this is for you guys it's

1120
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:38,460
white knuckle ride and uh...

1121
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:40,700
Song number two, Minnie Head, White Knuckle Ride.

1122
01:35:08,460 --> 01:35:13,460
Strap it in, let it slide, take me up to the sky

1123
01:35:13,460 --> 01:35:17,460
See the beer in my heart, beating like I'm gonna die

1124
01:35:17,460 --> 01:35:20,460
It's the rusty wounds inside, I keep shaking and I cannot hide

1125
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,460
Here we are, let's go inside

1126
01:35:22,460 --> 01:35:24,460
On this white knuckle ride

1127
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:32,460
On this white knuckle ride

1128
01:35:33,460 --> 01:35:35,460
On this white knuckle ride

1129
01:35:35,460 --> 01:35:42,460
Hang on to your home now, now, now, now

1130
01:37:05,460 --> 01:37:07,460
Why is that the whole ride?

1131
01:37:24,740 --> 01:37:26,740
My heart is beating like I'm gonna die

1132
01:37:30,340 --> 01:37:32,340
You're going out, let's go inside

1133
01:37:32,340 --> 01:37:34,340
I'm gonna eat you like I'm gonna die

1134
01:37:39,260 --> 01:37:41,260
I'm gonna eat you like I'm gonna die

1135
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:48,260
Give me a hand, let him fly My heart is beating like I'm gonna die

1136
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:50,260
Ha ha ha ha

1137
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:08,260
Drive me in, let him fly Take me up to the sky

1138
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:53,260
Hi, I'm here. Sorry. We're having a PictoChat orgy here in the studio. I had to take a break

1139
01:38:53,260 --> 01:38:59,060
from it for a minute. Anyway, that was song number two. Midi Head, White Knuckle Ride.

1140
01:38:59,060 --> 01:39:02,220
What do you guys think? Starting off with Dark Sakura.

1141
01:39:02,220 --> 01:39:04,700
I still hate that man's voice. Sorry.

1142
01:39:04,700 --> 01:39:05,700
But he's so cool.

1143
01:39:05,700 --> 01:39:12,260
he's cool don't get me wrong i just don't like his voice i don't think he can sing very well so um

1144
01:39:13,300 --> 01:39:19,780
it would have had a 10 but by virtue of voice it gets the name said all right uh

1145
01:39:19,780 --> 01:39:22,180
who's got a mic over there uh magus

1146
01:39:25,780 --> 01:39:33,380
um that's not a steaming pile of poo but it's all right probably gets like seven

1147
01:39:33,380 --> 01:39:35,380
Got a good beat behind it, though.

1148
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:38,380
Alright, Angel.

1149
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:40,380
Ow.

1150
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:42,380
Head rush. Okay, um...

1151
01:39:43,380 --> 01:39:45,380
Eight, because I like mini-heads.

1152
01:39:46,380 --> 01:39:48,380
And stuff. Yeah. Bye.

1153
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:54,380
Uh, me personally? I actually thought that song was pretty fucking rad. I think that's one of his better tracks.

1154
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,380
I kind of want to keep that one for myself.

1155
01:39:57,380 --> 01:39:58,380
So, I give it a nine and a half.

1156
01:39:59,380 --> 01:40:00,380
Loki.

1157
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:03,380
There's a microphone being shoved in my face.

1158
01:40:06,380 --> 01:40:08,380
Yeah, that was cool. I liked it. That's why I picked it.

1159
01:40:09,380 --> 01:40:10,380
It gets a 10.

1160
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,380
Alright, sounds good.

1161
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:19,380
Alright, let's get into song number 3. Song number 3 is Dark Sakura's Pick. What did you pick for us tonight?

1162
01:40:19,380 --> 01:40:31,380
Um, I like Yoko Kanno. She's really cool and she's a neat person in person. She signed our Macross Plus, uh, CD at AX, like, a while back.

1163
01:40:31,380 --> 01:40:40,380
Um, anyway, this is one from, uh, she, uh, sent us on the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell standalone complex. It's, uh, Rise.

1164
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:45,380
I'm trying to remember who sent it to me because I think it's in the chatroom right now, but I don't remember, so sorry.

1165
01:40:45,380 --> 01:40:51,460
all right yoko kano rise enjoy

1166
01:41:45,380 --> 01:41:50,380
I'm still not there at all

1167
01:41:50,380 --> 01:41:58,380
I'm still not there at all

1168
01:41:58,380 --> 01:42:00,380
I'm still not there at all

1169
01:42:00,380 --> 01:42:04,380
For the day when the pain is far behind

1170
01:42:04,380 --> 01:42:08,380
On your feet I'm missing

1171
01:42:08,380 --> 01:42:11,380
Fear is all that I lack

1172
01:42:11,380 --> 01:42:13,380
I'm still not there at all

1173
01:42:13,380 --> 01:42:18,080
Take your place, please, and follow the judge, please, say

1174
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:26,180
I'm so free, but only it's time to make this end reside

1175
01:42:26,180 --> 01:42:32,580
Here I go, bye

1176
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:46,580
I'm a soldier from the stand, in this waking hell I am

1177
01:42:46,580 --> 01:42:52,580
Listening more than I can come to you

1178
01:42:52,580 --> 01:42:56,580
Pray myself, please don't forget

1179
01:42:56,580 --> 01:42:59,580
Life could trade and be a threat

1180
01:42:59,580 --> 01:43:05,580
Please give me the strength to be a fool

1181
01:43:05,580 --> 01:43:12,580
People facing the fire together

1182
01:43:12,580 --> 01:43:15,580
It's me, it's only you

1183
01:43:15,580 --> 01:43:20,580
That we have found

1184
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:23,580
Don't save your tears, it's more than a day

1185
01:43:23,580 --> 01:43:26,580
When nothing is far behind

1186
01:43:26,580 --> 01:43:30,080
On your feet, I'll miss you

1187
01:43:30,080 --> 01:43:33,580
Be a flower, you'll never mind

1188
01:43:33,580 --> 01:43:36,580
Stand your fear, take your place

1189
01:43:36,580 --> 01:43:40,080
Save them for their judgment day

1190
01:43:40,080 --> 01:43:43,080
Just and free, follow me

1191
01:43:43,080 --> 01:43:48,080
And soon they will sacrifice

1192
01:43:48,080 --> 01:43:53,080
Your eyes were found

1193
01:44:48,080 --> 01:44:52,080
We could forever love you

1194
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:56,080
Would it be that you care about me?

1195
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:59,080
If you don't mind me

1196
01:44:59,080 --> 01:45:02,080
Let's go to the moonlight

1197
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:04,080
I'll be there

1198
01:45:04,080 --> 01:45:05,080
Don't go around

1199
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:07,080
Let's just go

1200
01:45:07,080 --> 01:45:09,080
Why don't you go?

1201
01:45:09,080 --> 01:45:12,080
And you are here for the day

1202
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,080
When the wind is far behind

1203
01:45:15,080 --> 01:45:18,580
On your feet, I'll be free

1204
01:45:18,580 --> 01:45:22,080
Fear not, so you can not hide

1205
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:25,080
I will give, take your place

1206
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:28,080
Pay to fall, I just will stay

1207
01:45:28,080 --> 01:45:33,080
But they're free, they're only time to make

1208
01:45:33,080 --> 01:45:36,080
Let me fly

1209
01:45:36,080 --> 01:45:46,080
Here I fall back

1210
01:46:06,080 --> 01:46:25,640
All right, song number three there, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

1211
01:46:25,640 --> 01:46:30,160
Did that one rise to the cage match occasion or did it fall flat on its ass?

1212
01:46:30,160 --> 01:46:31,160
Let's see, Jamie.

1213
01:46:31,160 --> 01:46:34,840
Yoko Kanno is awesome, so the song gets a night and a half.

1214
01:46:34,840 --> 01:46:35,840
Magus.

1215
01:46:35,840 --> 01:46:37,840
Pretty nice. I'd say 8.

1216
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:16,240
Number one you can vote for tonight, Hadaway, What is Love, Reloaded.

1217
01:47:16,240 --> 01:47:30,080
Song number two you can vote for tonight is Midi Head with White Knuckle Ride.

1218
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:42,180
The song number three you can vote for tonight, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1219
01:47:42,180 --> 01:47:45,480
I think this is a very hard cage match to decide tonight.

1220
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:49,040
I think we got three really good songs in here tonight, so this is going to be an interesting

1221
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:50,040
one.

1222
01:47:50,040 --> 01:47:52,040
Please vote now.

1223
01:47:52,040 --> 01:47:56,960
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1224
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:02,280
I know the chat room likes to bitch a lot that sometimes we give them three crappy songs to pick from but I seriously don't think

1225
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:07,520
You can complain about that tonight. You've got some old-school beats there with the what is love

1226
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:12,000
You've got some new-school like industrial sounding stuff with a MIDI head and then you've got the J

1227
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:17,640
Like I don't want to call it J pop, but the J opera rock or something

1228
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:22,040
I don't know with the yokogano. So there's definitely something to choose from from every spectrum

1229
01:48:22,040 --> 01:48:25,280
There's some good songs. So good luck you guys trying to figure that one out should be a close one

1230
01:48:25,280 --> 01:48:29,520
one sent a private message to sky with your vote I'm getting some votes in

1231
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:36,000
right now I had a question from Asian buddy Paul in our chat room he wants to

1232
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:39,840
check in on the ultra Kade kicking gallery that we're gonna have

1233
01:48:39,840 --> 01:48:43,180
unfortunately I didn't get a chance to work on that last week we actually had a

1234
01:48:43,180 --> 01:48:47,760
photo from one of our other listeners send in a photo of him kicking a

1235
01:48:47,760 --> 01:48:51,560
ultra Kade machine and was wondering where you can send in those pictures

1236
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:55,560
Send those to Rob at OrangeOnsRadio.com. I'm gonna go ahead and just take

1237
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:58,600
charge with setting up the gallery, so go ahead and send those. If you happen to

1238
01:48:58,600 --> 01:49:02,720
send them to Jamie or Matt, they will make sure I get them, or they'll get them

1239
01:49:02,720 --> 01:49:05,840
in the gallery themselves. But you can go ahead and send those to me, Rob at OrangeOnsRadio.com.

1240
01:49:05,840 --> 01:49:09,240
In fact, I'm kind of curious if he sent it already, because if he did, I want to

1241
01:49:09,240 --> 01:49:14,360
show it to the folks in the studio, because I love ultra-cade kicking pictures. And

1242
01:49:14,360 --> 01:49:19,520
again, please remind Loki or Jamie, I know you're both in on this, why should folks

1243
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:24,120
be sending us pictures of them kicking UltraCade machines. Because UltraCade is trying to trademark

1244
01:49:24,120 --> 01:49:30,240
the Mame name and they can't because Mame already belongs to somebody else. So this

1245
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:34,080
person is a big retard so we have to kick UltraCade machines. There it is. Look at that.

1246
01:49:34,080 --> 01:49:39,360
Lovely kick. That's not even a kick. Like they are kicking the actual panel there. There.

1247
01:49:39,360 --> 01:49:43,000
That's a like you could get. That owns. That's a you could get busted in the arcade picture

1248
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:47,600
right there. So thank you our buddy Paul there for sending us that. That's a great pick.

1249
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:51,760
Sadly enough, the abuse of these cabinets is going to have to take.

1250
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:55,840
We can't actually kick the Altercade components, because, I mean, Altercade is just put in

1251
01:49:55,840 --> 01:49:57,080
these cabinets.

1252
01:49:57,080 --> 01:49:59,880
The cabinets have no say what games inside of them.

1253
01:49:59,880 --> 01:50:01,960
Kick the right side where it hits the jamma harness.

1254
01:50:01,960 --> 01:50:04,360
Yes, you have to kick the jamma harness.

1255
01:50:04,360 --> 01:50:07,960
No, no, but actually just kick any part of it, because a lot of these cabinets are sold

1256
01:50:07,960 --> 01:50:10,600
with it already in there, so.

1257
01:50:10,600 --> 01:50:12,320
You know what?

1258
01:50:12,320 --> 01:50:13,320
They're guilty by association.

1259
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,200
Think of the cabinets, though.

1260
01:50:15,200 --> 01:50:16,200
And if you get busted...

1261
01:50:16,200 --> 01:50:24,200
No, I want the disclaimer here. We did not tell you to do this. I'm not gonna get angry

1262
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:32,880
letters from your arcade owner. You should pose like you're kicking the machine, but

1263
01:50:32,880 --> 01:50:37,080
don't really kick it, because we don't want to get your arcade owners upset. And if you

1264
01:50:37,080 --> 01:50:41,640
do, and if they're mad, we don't know you. And we disown you. You were never here. That's

1265
01:50:41,640 --> 01:50:51,840
right. Alright. Loki, you know I always ask you this around this time of the show, and

1266
01:50:51,840 --> 01:50:56,600
you know, even if there's no news, I have to ask you anyway. What the hell is going

1267
01:50:56,600 --> 01:51:02,480
on in the sim scene, my friend? What's going on is this fucking aim is attached to goddamn

1268
01:51:02,480 --> 01:51:09,480
Outlook Express and that makes me angry. Stupid Outlook and MAME. Anyways, our aim. Anyways,

1269
01:51:10,480 --> 01:51:17,480
Simzine. See, only a couple things are actually going on here. Ooh, Matrix Online launch update.

1270
01:51:17,480 --> 01:51:24,480
Anyways, there is a couple things. First off, Technofine. They're working on yet another

1271
01:51:24,480 --> 01:51:31,480
theme. It's, I think, Technofine Retroactive. It's like a yellow version of Technofine that

1272
01:51:31,480 --> 01:51:36,480
looks kind of neat. There's a whole thread on it on Bamai Cell and that's supposed to

1273
01:51:36,480 --> 01:51:40,620
be coming out. Nothing new on Food Mix 2 as far as I'm aware, but I'm going to double

1274
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:49,220
check just to be certain on that. Aside from that, the also there's the, I can't remember

1275
01:51:49,220 --> 01:51:57,740
what it's called now. It was this old thing that they had going on. Virtual Visions, that's

1276
01:51:57,740 --> 01:52:03,700
what it was. Virtual Visions, which is a project that started back in DDR Maniacs, and that

1277
01:52:03,700 --> 01:52:09,260
was actually a group of people who were going to be taking a big list of overclocked music

1278
01:52:09,260 --> 01:52:15,180
from Overclock.org, and those are all video game remixes, and they're making a step file

1279
01:52:15,180 --> 01:52:20,740
pack for those, and that's still going on right now. And there's a big huge forum now,

1280
01:52:20,740 --> 01:52:24,740
It's actually a section of their forums that you can actually check out.

1281
01:52:26,740 --> 01:52:32,740
See, other than that, DDR Maniacs is saying they're coming back, whenever that is.

1282
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:37,740
But that's supposedly gonna happen. I mean, not that anyone really cares.

1283
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:45,740
But Mycell's talking about launching version 7 at some point, so, and they promise, like, more stuff.

1284
01:52:45,740 --> 01:52:51,340
stuff. They remodel their site more than WeGetNewGuitarFreak's arcade mixes. Seriously.

1285
01:52:51,340 --> 01:52:54,920
So anyways, that's supposedly happening.

1286
01:52:54,920 --> 01:52:59,020
Um, I checked today to see if there's a new version of StepMania. Guess what? No!

1287
01:52:59,020 --> 01:53:02,380
How long have we been waiting for StepMania 4.0?

1288
01:53:02,380 --> 01:53:06,900
How long? Yeah, okay, that's what I'm saying. No one even cares anymore, I think.

1289
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:10,180
Does anyone actually play StepMania? Maybe. I don't know.

1290
01:53:10,180 --> 01:53:13,420
I did. Um, other than that,

1291
01:53:13,420 --> 01:53:23,420
I'm trying to see right now, we're going to go to the FoodMix page to see if there's anything going on there, because I suspect that there might be, but you know, I need to double check.

1292
01:53:23,420 --> 01:53:39,420
Um, I was downloading, though, there's like, you know, you can get a lot of themes and stuff, um, on Mysore, they have a whole, you know, section and stuff for that, but um, let's see, FoodMix, FoodMix, FoodMix, here we go.

1293
01:53:39,420 --> 01:53:51,100
And, what do you know, no news for FoodMix. But, it's, uh, FoodMix 2 is still in progress. No date for that. Look forward to it coming out, though, pretty soon, I'd imagine.

1294
01:53:51,100 --> 01:54:21,060
And the next big thing we have coming up is the, um, there is another, um, thing here. I think it's, like, what was it, a DDX, yeah, DDRXX mix, and they're talking about a release date for, um, April 1st, I believe, was the release date for that one, and that's supposed to be a big, like, food mix type thing where there's a ton of, you know, different, um,

1295
01:54:21,100 --> 01:54:26,060
things to play. So, I think that was the one. There's one of them that's launching April

1296
01:54:26,060 --> 01:54:31,620
1st, I don't remember by chance which one that is, but I think it's that one. And that's

1297
01:54:31,620 --> 01:54:38,420
it. Ton of, oh, there's some other people there releasing, which is kind of neat. The,

1298
01:54:38,420 --> 01:54:44,380
oh god what was it, like, there's In The Groove stuff that's coming out right now, and then

1299
01:54:44,380 --> 01:54:56,380
And then there's also, um, sim files for, uh, god, what was that, um, DJ Max, that are being released right now, and the DJ Max songs are pretty cool.

1300
01:54:56,380 --> 01:55:06,380
Those are, for those who don't know, those are, um, it's an online Beatmania-type game that was made by the creators of Easy to DJ, the other DJ game that's actually pretty good.

1301
01:55:06,380 --> 01:55:14,180
Alright, thank you for that update. It was a lot longer than I was expecting, actually.

1302
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:19,220
Usually it's, eh, all the signs are down, nobody cares. That's nice to know that things

1303
01:55:19,220 --> 01:55:23,340
are still alive and kicking in the sim scene. You guys want a note to the winner of tonight's

1304
01:55:23,340 --> 01:55:29,300
cage match? Sure, why not? Now, I thought this would be a very, very close cage match

1305
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:35,140
tonight because we had three very good songs, but in the end, one of these songs just, for

1306
01:55:35,140 --> 01:55:38,900
For lack of a better term, it really just blew the other two out of the water.

1307
01:55:38,900 --> 01:55:42,900
I don't know how else to say it, but this song definitely won tonight.

1308
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:50,420
It is Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1309
01:55:50,420 --> 01:55:52,180
Getting a pretty large portion of the vote tonight.

1310
01:55:52,180 --> 01:55:53,180
That's pretty cool.

1311
01:55:53,180 --> 01:55:55,300
I didn't realize it would be a big gap.

1312
01:55:55,300 --> 01:55:56,980
I didn't either.

1313
01:55:56,980 --> 01:55:58,900
I'm kind of sad by that.

1314
01:55:58,900 --> 01:55:59,940
That's it.

1315
01:55:59,940 --> 01:56:02,340
It's coming back.

1342
01:58:50,920 --> 01:58:58,920
It's, like, very deformed. And I think we're done.

1343
01:58:58,920 --> 01:59:05,920
I will never ask you people to fill time ever again. Oh my God! I can see on the webcam! It looks like a big...

1344
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:09,920

We'll be back after this.

1347
01:59:46,500 --> 01:59:50,500
You get it? Alright, let's practice.

1348
01:59:50,500 --> 01:59:53,500
First, hit the white keys.

1349
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:04,500
Now, hit the black keys.

1350
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:19,500
Okay, now a combination of both white and black keys.

1351
02:00:19,500 --> 02:00:21,500
Easy, huh?

1352
02:00:21,500 --> 02:00:23,500
You better stop it, don't drop it

1353
02:00:23,500 --> 02:00:25,500
There ain't no living here, no real life

1354
02:00:25,500 --> 02:00:27,500
Don't you ask me, let me tell you

1355
02:00:27,500 --> 02:00:29,500
It better change back if you see

1356
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:31,500
It better change back if you see

1357
02:00:31,500 --> 02:00:33,500
Alright, let's go on to the scratch game

1358
02:00:33,500 --> 02:00:35,500
When the objects reach the red line

1359
02:00:35,500 --> 02:00:37,500
Scratch!

1360
02:00:37,500 --> 02:00:39,500
And if you do, don't play it

1361
02:00:39,500 --> 02:00:41,500
Move your bullshit, you better

1362
02:00:41,500 --> 02:00:45,500
With the fast notes, the technique is to scratch fast.

1363
02:00:54,000 --> 02:00:57,500
Now it's all the keys and the turntable.

1364
02:00:57,500 --> 02:00:59,500
It's hard, but you can do it!

1365
02:01:19,100 --> 02:01:21,500
Okay, effector time!

1366
02:01:21,500 --> 02:01:25,500
Here's the effect of the new beatmania!

1367
02:01:25,500 --> 02:01:29,500
Look, way below, do you see the foot switch?

1368
02:01:29,500 --> 02:01:32,500
That's the effect on and on bridge.

1369
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:36,500
With this trimmer, you can shoot your effect.

1370
02:01:36,500 --> 02:01:40,500
I'll show you, so trim with me, alright?

1371
02:01:43,500 --> 02:01:47,500
Hey, do you hear the variety of effect?

1372
02:01:47,500 --> 02:01:52,500
With this limiter, you can change the strength and the depth of the effect.

1373
02:01:54,500 --> 02:01:59,500
This powerful sound system will make everybody hot!

1374
02:01:59,500 --> 02:02:09,500
All right, here we go! Knock you out with your fabulous sound on this merry-go-round version of Speed Mania!

1375
02:02:29,500 --> 02:02:32,500

02:02:32,500 --> 02:02:34,500
Re-mixed.

1377
02:02:34,500 --> 02:02:59,940
We'll be meeting, next.

1378
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:25,860
Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake...

1379
02:03:25,860 --> 02:03:29,860
Solid snake, solid snake, solid snake

1380
02:03:29,860 --> 02:03:31,860
Can you hear what I'm saying?

1381
02:03:31,860 --> 02:03:34,860
World is down to take a man that wants him back

1382
02:03:34,860 --> 02:03:37,860
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all

1383
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:39,860
Down, what am I gonna do?

1384
02:03:39,860 --> 02:03:41,860
Down, down, what am I gonna do?

1385
02:03:41,860 --> 02:03:43,860
Down, what am I gonna do?

1386
02:03:47,860 --> 02:03:50,860
Have you ever seen a cool game like this?

1387
02:03:50,860 --> 02:03:52,860
We go here.

1388
02:04:50,860 --> 02:05:17,820
Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song on Orange Lounge Radio.

1389
02:05:17,820 --> 02:05:21,940
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, hope you enjoyed that break, Emotion was the last

1390
02:05:21,940 --> 02:05:27,860
song you heard before that, Metal Gear, remixed there, and starting that set off was Instant

1391
02:05:27,860 --> 02:05:32,820
Love, also known as the tutorial song from Beatmania, which, who doesn't love that song?

1392
02:05:32,820 --> 02:05:34,620
DJ Konami is the man.

1393
02:05:34,620 --> 02:05:35,620
What can I say?

1394
02:05:35,620 --> 02:05:39,140
Alright, so, how did the microwave peep turn out in the end?

1395
02:05:39,140 --> 02:05:42,460
I noticed the webcam was constantly being updated there during break, I put some random

1396
02:05:42,460 --> 02:05:44,660
things up on cam as well, how'd that go?

1397
02:05:44,660 --> 02:05:54,620
I turned it into an OLR logo. You are very strange. That's all I have to say. Of course,

are gonna get to after this period here we will get into the DDR freak post of

1407
02:06:39,380 --> 02:06:44,300
week, and we'll also get into the FUs of the week as well. But we do have a call. Hello,

1408
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:49,060
you are on Orange Lawn's radio. And for the third time in a row, it's Ronma. Hi, guys.

1409
02:06:49,060 --> 02:06:54,340
Hello, Ronma, how you doing? I'm doing pretty good. Yeah? I have another picture for you.

1410
02:06:54,340 --> 02:07:00,140
Oh, the, the, um, uh, ulcercade ticking. Mm-hmm. I, could you, could you post the link one

1411
02:07:00,140 --> 02:07:03,660
more time in the chatroom? I didn't get a chance to look at it because I was busy queuing

1412
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:11,140
up that particular break. Sure, no problem. Let me scroll back up here. Here we go. The

1413
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:15,380
wonders of the internet. I can actually hear the click, click, click, click, click. As

1414
02:07:15,380 --> 02:07:20,980
you're scrolling up there. Yay! I hear Jamie cheering, so it must be a good picture. And

1415
02:07:20,980 --> 02:07:25,780
there's that one. Oh, I'd seen that one previously. Is that the one you showed me on Thursday?

1416
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:29,380
Didn't you show me one on Thursday? I don't remember. I think those were the ones from

1417
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:36,380
like last from last week, and we went out this past week and got a new one.

1418
02:07:37,940 --> 02:07:39,940
I do, I do. I'm about to get the link to that right now.

1419
02:07:39,940 --> 02:07:41,940
Oh, okay. I want that one. Give me the new one.

1420
02:07:41,940 --> 02:07:43,940
Okay. There you go.

1421
02:07:43,940 --> 02:07:45,940
Yay, okay. Oh, yes.

1422
02:07:45,940 --> 02:07:47,940
Ooh, it's big.

1423
02:07:47,940 --> 02:07:54,940
This one's a new picture. I'd seen those two previous ones. Again, he's posted these in our chat room at www.oipontario.com.

1424
02:07:54,940 --> 02:08:03,940
Oh, a monitor kick! Very nice. What is that guy behind you playing DDR?

1425
02:08:03,940 --> 02:08:05,940
Oh, I have a little story about that.

1426
02:08:05,940 --> 02:08:13,940
The guy behind you playing DDR looks like he is, like, in a shower or something. I mean, my God, he's covered in sweat.

1427
02:08:13,940 --> 02:08:14,940
Doubles heavy.

1428
02:08:14,940 --> 02:08:15,940
That is a sweaty, sweaty man.

1429
02:08:15,940 --> 02:08:18,940
He's a sweaty man. What's up with that?

1430
02:08:18,940 --> 02:08:20,940
He was playing doubles heavy.

1431
02:08:20,940 --> 02:08:21,940
Oh, well, I guess...

1432
02:08:21,940 --> 02:08:22,940
I don't see two sets of arrows.

1433
02:08:22,940 --> 02:08:26,940
Wait, yeah, I don't see two sets of arrows there. He was playing, but he's not playing in the picture.

1434
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:32,940
Okay, it's probably just...he was playing doubles earlier. What happened was, me and my friends went to play DDR. They have two machines.

1435
02:08:32,940 --> 02:08:37,940
He was playing. A bunch of hood rats came in and started insulting him.

1436
02:08:37,940 --> 02:08:39,940
Oh, no.

1437
02:08:39,940 --> 02:08:46,940
So, after he played, I said to them, why don't you guys get on and play? They're like, you first.

1438
02:08:46,940 --> 02:08:52,940
There's the way to do it. I mean, remember that little kid we scared off from Golf Land one time because he was making fun of us?

1439
02:08:52,940 --> 02:08:55,940
Didn't I challenge him to a duel or something and he ran away?

1440
02:08:55,940 --> 02:09:00,940
There was one time where I had these guys hanging around and they were talking all kinds of shit, so I said,

1441
02:09:00,940 --> 02:09:07,940
Okay, I'll pay for you to play if you really think that it's that stupid, but I pick the song.

1442
02:09:10,940 --> 02:09:13,940
I had them thrown out later that night.

1443
02:09:13,940 --> 02:09:18,940
So, after you kicked the Ultra-Cade machine, you had to go kick these guys a little bit?

1444
02:09:18,940 --> 02:09:24,940
Yes, and for the first time in my life, I double-A'd all four songs, right in front of them.

1445
02:09:24,940 --> 02:09:30,940
Oh, very nice. It's those moments of pressure when you start doing really well at DDR, huh?

1446
02:09:30,940 --> 02:09:31,940
Yeah.

1447
02:09:31,940 --> 02:09:33,940
Very nice. Congratulations, my friend.

1448
02:09:33,940 --> 02:09:35,940
Thanks. Oh, and, um...

1449
02:09:35,940 --> 02:09:40,940
And I just want to point out the arcade there. The Ultra-Cade machine is right next to the DDR machine,

1450
02:09:40,940 --> 02:09:45,940
which I think is a very interesting setup there. But anyway, I'm sorry, your thought?

1451
02:09:45,940 --> 02:09:56,940
Yeah, if anyone hasn't gotten it yet, the PSP is coming out on Thursday. Best Buy, you can go right to Best Buy and pick it up at 8 o'clock in the morning. No reserves, first come, first serve.

1452
02:09:56,940 --> 02:10:04,940
If you were a lazy bum and didn't pre-order it, like myself, that's probably going to be your only option, and that is exactly what I had to do with the DS, because I'm a lazy bum.

1453
02:10:04,940 --> 02:10:08,740
to counter that, you could just preorder it at Gamestop, have somebody call you the day

1454
02:10:08,740 --> 02:10:11,340
before and pick it up at your convenience.

1455
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:12,780
Even better.

1456
02:10:12,780 --> 02:10:13,780
You could.

1457
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:16,620
Or you could have a fiancé that works at Gamestop and just bring it home.

1458
02:10:16,620 --> 02:10:20,100
Exactly, and he could be all, Bitch, bring it home!

1459
02:10:20,100 --> 02:10:23,700
Because it's gonna be, Or I ain't putting out, I ain't putting out.

1460
02:10:23,700 --> 02:10:28,500
And my Final Fantasy XI atlas.

1461
02:10:28,500 --> 02:10:31,500
I totally want a Final Fantasy XI atlas, but then again I don't.

1462
02:10:31,500 --> 02:10:32,500
I quit that game.

1463
02:10:32,500 --> 02:10:34,900
I quit that game, Rob, I quit that game.

1464
02:10:34,900 --> 02:10:37,820
Anyway, any other thoughts, Rama, before I let you go?

1465
02:10:37,820 --> 02:10:40,660
One thing, I have one of my new friends just listening tonight.

1466
02:10:40,660 --> 02:10:42,860
I just want to say, hi, Liz.

1467
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:43,580
Hi, Liz.

1468
02:10:43,580 --> 02:10:44,740
Shout out.

1469
02:10:44,740 --> 02:10:46,060
Shout out.

1470
02:10:46,060 --> 02:10:47,180
Hey, Carson.

1471
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:49,260
I love Britney Spears.

1472
02:10:49,260 --> 02:10:50,380
Pay me some Britney Spears.

1473
02:10:50,380 --> 02:10:52,860
I want to give a shout out to Liz.

1474
02:10:52,860 --> 02:10:54,360
Hi, Liz.

1475
02:10:54,360 --> 02:10:56,540
And I'm going to do my special impersonation just

1476
02:10:56,540 --> 02:10:57,300
for your friend.

1477
02:10:57,300 --> 02:10:57,800
OK.

1478
02:11:00,800 --> 02:11:01,940
Thank you.

1479
02:11:01,940 --> 02:11:03,100
You guys rock.

1480
02:11:03,100 --> 02:11:04,020
All right, thank you.

1481
02:11:04,020 --> 02:11:08,900
you rock for calling. Have a good one. You too. Later. Hi. How about a ferret before

1482
02:11:08,900 --> 02:11:11,940
I pick up the next call? How about a ferret beep for Liz? Well then I gotta get to the

1483
02:11:11,940 --> 02:11:17,420
next call. Really quick. Okay, really quick. Then I'm getting to this next call. Ferret

1484
02:11:17,420 --> 02:11:25,420
for Liz. Hello? Okay. Yes, hi. You are on Orange Lounge Radio. Who this? Hey, this is

1485
02:11:25,420 --> 02:11:30,340
SSJ100 Matt. Hello SSJ100 Matt. What is on your mind, my friend? Nothing. I just want

1486
02:11:30,340 --> 02:11:36,340
I just want to apologize to a dark sacra about the little argument in the chat room earlier.

1487
02:11:36,340 --> 02:11:37,340
Okay.

1488
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:38,340
Okay, apology accepted.

1489
02:11:38,340 --> 02:11:39,340
Thank you.

1490
02:11:39,340 --> 02:11:40,340
Okay.

1491
02:11:40,340 --> 02:11:41,340
Okay.

1492
02:11:41,340 --> 02:11:42,340
Aww.

1493
02:11:42,340 --> 02:11:43,340
Aww, I love moments.

1494
02:11:43,340 --> 02:11:44,340
That's so sweet.

1495
02:11:44,340 --> 02:11:45,340
I love moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1496
02:11:45,340 --> 02:11:46,340
Aww.

1497
02:11:46,340 --> 02:11:47,340
See, I'm nice.

1498
02:11:47,340 --> 02:11:48,340
I'm nice.

1499
02:11:48,340 --> 02:11:50,260
I'm the bad guy.

1500
02:11:50,260 --> 02:11:53,340
Nobody said you weren't a nice guy, it's just you might have some typing issues.

1501
02:11:53,340 --> 02:11:54,340
No, I'm kidding.

1502
02:11:54,340 --> 02:11:55,340
I'm totally kidding.

1503
02:11:55,340 --> 02:11:56,340
I get criticized for my pronunciation.

1504
02:11:56,340 --> 02:11:57,340
Pronunciation.

1505
02:11:57,340 --> 02:11:58,340
Pronunciation.

1506
02:11:58,340 --> 02:11:59,340
Pronunciation.

1507
02:11:59,340 --> 02:12:05,340
Well, when I was four, I glued my fingers together, so, you know.

1508
02:12:05,340 --> 02:12:07,340
It happens.

1509
02:12:07,340 --> 02:12:08,340
Exactly.

1510
02:12:08,340 --> 02:12:12,340
Any thoughts on 2DX Nightstyle, or any of the new stuff coming out?

1511
02:12:12,340 --> 02:12:14,340
Um, I don't really know what that is.

1512
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:16,340
Oh, that's alright. In the Groove, you know that one?

1513
02:12:16,340 --> 02:12:25,340
Yeah, well, you know, my arcade kind of has it, except they don't, but you know, they've had like the whole box and everything for it,

1514
02:12:25,340 --> 02:12:30,340
everything for it, but they still have DDR fourth mix.

1515
02:12:30,340 --> 02:12:33,340
In the groove cabinet they have DDR fourth mix?

1516
02:12:33,340 --> 02:12:35,340
Yeah, they've had it in there for like about two weeks.

1517
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:42,340
Now, that is ironic, when you consider that In the Groove is kind of a stowaway game, and you always see In the Groove and DDR cabinets, that is great.

1518
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:44,340
That sounds like an upgrade.

1519
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:48,340
It is an upgrade. I agree with you on that.

1520
02:12:48,340 --> 02:12:53,340
Alright, very nice. I miss fourth mix. Fourth mix was such a wonderful mix.

1521
02:12:53,340 --> 02:12:55,340
Is it 4th plus or 4th mix?

1522
02:12:55,340 --> 02:12:57,340
4th plus.

1523
02:12:57,340 --> 02:12:59,340
Play some conga feelin' for me.

1524
02:12:59,340 --> 02:13:01,340
Cause we don't have 4th plus here anymore.

1525
02:13:01,340 --> 02:13:03,340
He's like, no way.

1526
02:13:03,340 --> 02:13:05,340
No way.

1527
02:13:05,340 --> 02:13:07,340
Alright, try it.

1528
02:13:07,340 --> 02:13:09,340
Play some Rhythm and Police.

1529
02:13:09,340 --> 02:13:11,340
Rhythm and Police is cool.

1530
02:13:11,340 --> 02:13:13,340
Alright, any other thoughts SSJ?

1531
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:19,340
Not really, just a little excited about the anime convention in Arizona that's coming this week.

1532
02:13:19,340 --> 02:13:21,340
What city?

1533
02:13:21,340 --> 02:13:24,860
Phoenix, all right, right on. And what's the name of it?

1534
02:13:24,860 --> 02:13:28,420
Anizona, Anizona.

1535
02:13:28,420 --> 02:13:32,740
Okay. Oh, like Arizona, but Anizona. I get it. That's cute. Okay.

1536
02:13:32,740 --> 02:13:36,580
And the guest of honor is Yoshitaka Mano.

1537
02:13:36,580 --> 02:13:41,060
Oh, okay. I'm going to Arizona. Bye, y'all.

1538
02:13:41,060 --> 02:13:45,220
Are you really? No. But I would. Oh my god, he's like my favorite artist.

1539
02:13:45,220 --> 02:13:48,220
Our webmaster lives in Arizona. I bet you he might be checking that out.

1540
02:13:48,220 --> 02:13:51,480
Jason has to go talk to my hero for me.

1541
02:13:51,480 --> 02:13:53,720
Jason's not listening tonight, which is kinda weird.

1542
02:13:53,720 --> 02:13:54,520
Damn him!

1543
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,920
I know.

1544
02:13:55,920 --> 02:13:56,720
Alright, well...

1545
02:13:56,720 --> 02:13:59,420
I need to meet my artistic hero.

1546
02:13:59,420 --> 02:14:04,020
Have fun at the convention, if we had money we would go too, but unfortunately we're poor, so we have to go to the...

1547
02:14:04,020 --> 02:14:07,620
Maybe I'll get an autograph for Sakura as a peace offering.

1548
02:14:07,620 --> 02:14:09,420
Aww, that's so nice of you!

1549
02:14:09,420 --> 02:14:12,920
Aww, I just feel like... I just want to give you both a hug.

1550
02:14:12,920 --> 02:14:14,520
I'll stop convoking you.

1551
02:14:14,520 --> 02:14:15,720
Alright.

1552
02:14:15,720 --> 02:14:19,160
Have a good one, buddy. Thanks for calling in. That was very big of you. Have a good one.

1553
02:14:19,160 --> 02:14:22,160
Yep, bye. Later. Aww.

1554
02:14:22,160 --> 02:14:26,040
Aww, I'm just feeling- I feel fuzzy wuzzy and I

1555
02:14:26,040 --> 02:14:29,320
I feel sick! Rob? Yes.

1556
02:14:29,320 --> 02:14:32,400
Alright, that was fun.

1557
02:14:32,400 --> 02:14:37,120
Ahh. A lovely, uh,

1558
02:14:37,120 --> 02:14:40,560
Skype segment tonight. Can't complain about that one.

1559
02:14:40,560 --> 02:14:43,860
I was gonna go to a break, but then I realized we just had a break. We can't do

1560
02:14:43,860 --> 02:14:45,080
that, so we need to-

1561
02:14:45,080 --> 02:14:51,080
Yeah, we need to take a break from race. We need to get into the FUs of the week, is what we need to do, dammit.

1562
02:14:51,080 --> 02:14:53,080
I'm not angry anymore!

1563
02:14:53,080 --> 02:14:55,080
Which is exactly why we need to do it now.

1564
02:15:00,080 --> 02:15:02,080
Actually, something did piss me off a lot today.

1565
02:15:02,080 --> 02:15:06,080
Alright, so good, we do have something. So, then, that being said, you guys can send it in.

1566
02:15:06,080 --> 02:15:11,080
Oh, I'm sorry, Angel. Oh, I just, now I'm gonna get an FU for that, I'm gonna get an FU for that.

1567
02:15:11,080 --> 02:15:13,080
You're about to bust that thing of coke open.

1568
02:15:13,080 --> 02:15:24,080
Seriously, um, I'm sorry. Uh, you can send in your FUs over private message. Please keep them short. Be courteous of the other listeners who want to get in their FUs as well.

1569
02:15:24,080 --> 02:15:28,080
Uh, Dark Sacra, why do we do this every single week?

1570
02:15:28,080 --> 02:15:29,080
Ah!

1571
02:15:29,080 --> 02:15:49,720
Okay, I have to explain this.

1572
02:15:49,720 --> 02:15:54,420
Everybody knows that I have this thing about old people who drive really, really slow,

1573
02:15:54,420 --> 02:15:57,880
and then I have a thing about people who talk on their cell phones while they drive.

1574
02:15:57,880 --> 02:16:03,480
I had the ultimate in piss off today because I was stuck behind this old guy talking on

1575
02:16:03,480 --> 02:16:11,040
his cell phone who was he looked like he was all veiny and ancient and like leaning over

1576
02:16:11,040 --> 02:16:15,920
over the steering wheel you know that type and then talking on his damn cell phone I'm

1577
02:16:15,920 --> 02:16:20,320
like veiny and ancient you know what I mean when people get really

1578
02:16:20,320 --> 02:16:31,920
old that you can feel their pain. His wife was in the car with him. I don't think anyone

1579
02:16:31,920 --> 02:16:38,200
was having a heart attack. Billy! How did you get trapped in the phone? Anyway, I just

1580
02:16:38,200 --> 02:16:43,240
passed him and cut him off and that was good. Did that make you feel better? Yeah it did.

1581
02:16:43,240 --> 02:16:45,240
I didn't really cut them off, but eh.

1582
02:16:45,240 --> 02:16:54,560
Um, another F.U. goes toward our lovely president, fucking asshole, for um, bringing Senate to

1583
02:16:54,560 --> 02:17:00,660
vote about that lady in Florida, with the, that had the, alright, this is a lady who

1584
02:17:00,660 --> 02:17:06,740
had been brain dead for 15 years, getting no oxygen to her brain, she was a vegetable,

1585
02:17:06,740 --> 02:17:11,820
she still is a vegetable, she will not be anything but a living vegetable, and so they

1586
02:17:11,820 --> 02:17:16,720
got authorization to take the feeding tube out finally and said it is you know

1587
02:17:16,720 --> 02:17:20,640
they have other things they could be voting on like you know allotting more

1588
02:17:20,640 --> 02:17:28,240
money toward you know useful things or you know improvement of our social

1589
02:17:28,240 --> 02:17:32,940
systems instead they're voting on whether or not to let a basically a

1590
02:17:32,940 --> 02:17:37,600
corpse on life support actually be a real corpse and said you know they're

1591
02:17:37,600 --> 02:17:42,700
costing this family all of these doctor bills just because of this whole right

1592
02:17:42,700 --> 02:17:47,440
to die issue she's not there anymore sorry no one home let her go

1593
02:17:47,440 --> 02:17:55,440
but Jamie we can rebuild them we have the technology we could put Walt Disney's

1594
02:17:55,440 --> 02:18:00,540
brain in there. E.T. phoned home already. What we're left with is to actually she's

1595
02:18:00,540 --> 02:18:07,220
probably more intelligent than him right now but I say you know why I say we

1596
02:18:07,220 --> 02:18:11,280
electus lady president. She'd do a better job. You know what I'm scared about? The fact

1597
02:18:11,280 --> 02:18:17,720
that we have living dead. We do. Stop cultivating zombies. You know she's gonna get out of the

1598
02:18:17,720 --> 02:18:24,720
bed. Brains! Brains! That's why she's brain dead! She needs brains! You see, you see.

1599
02:18:25,720 --> 02:18:31,720
This woman is starving to death for 14 days and you're like, brain! Well, let you guys

1600
02:18:31,720 --> 02:18:36,720
starve to death! Oh, that's what we need, a brain dead person starving for brains! That's

1601
02:18:36,720 --> 02:18:39,760
Okay, I F you, so fuck you, shut up!

1602
02:18:39,760 --> 02:18:44,080
She does not know

1603
02:18:44,080 --> 02:18:47,360
that she's starving. She doesn't have

1604
02:18:47,360 --> 02:18:54,360
the capacity to register pain.

1605
02:18:57,120 --> 02:19:01,120
Okay, how about when they pull the plug on life support? Same thing.

1606
02:19:01,120 --> 02:19:06,120
That tube is her life support.

1607
02:19:06,120 --> 02:19:08,120
it's not like her heart shuts down and she dies

1608
02:19:08,120 --> 02:19:10,120
she is unable to eat

1609
02:19:10,120 --> 02:19:12,120
she's not even there

1610
02:19:12,120 --> 02:19:14,120
it's a body with no place

1611
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:16,120
i think it's gonna be one of those

1612
02:19:16,120 --> 02:19:18,120
two words to settle a dispute

1613
02:19:18,120 --> 02:19:20,120
lethal injection

1614
02:19:20,120 --> 02:19:22,120
okay? if you're going to kill her

1615
02:19:22,120 --> 02:19:24,120
do it quickly

1616
02:19:24,120 --> 02:19:26,120
don't leave her to wither and starve

1617
02:19:26,120 --> 02:19:28,120
and die away slowly

1618
02:19:28,120 --> 02:19:30,120
this is my epi thank you

1619
02:19:30,120 --> 02:19:32,120
we disagree with you

1620
02:19:32,120 --> 02:19:34,120
i honestly

1621
02:19:34,120 --> 02:19:39,280
would prefer lethal injection but if they have to do anything you know the

1622
02:19:39,280 --> 02:19:42,940
only legal recourse they have is to take the tube out and let her die of natural

1623
02:19:42,940 --> 02:19:46,720
causes because technically it is a natural cause she is incapable of taking

1624
02:19:46,720 --> 02:19:51,380
care of herself she's not even there anymore there's nobody home you know

1625
02:19:51,380 --> 02:19:56,100
basically it's letting a corpse be a corpse you know you don't keep you know

1626
02:19:56,100 --> 02:20:00,220
here take your vitamin dead person let me dig you up and put a chicken wing

1627
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:03,580
but then if she's not there anymore how is the rest of her body functioning

1628
02:20:03,580 --> 02:20:06,500
without any life support so obviously her brain is working enough to keep her

1629
02:20:06,500 --> 02:20:10,340
heart beating very minimal functions but there but how do you know she can't feel

1630
02:20:10,340 --> 02:20:15,040
anything how do you know she can't feel starvation okay there's no there is no

1631
02:20:15,040 --> 02:20:22,020
mind or soul left in her body it has departed it's that there's nothing there

1632
02:20:22,020 --> 02:20:26,060
she can't she cannot maintain the cognitive functions of the of the

1633
02:20:26,060 --> 02:20:31,060
average human being I'll put it that way she has no cognitive functions and the

1634
02:20:31,060 --> 02:20:37,160
story at any rate I I would say that if they could just go ahead and kill her I

1635
02:20:37,160 --> 02:20:40,720
would say if they could legally get away with just injecting her and killing her

1636
02:20:40,720 --> 02:20:45,400
to do it I would encourage somebody to go you get it at home no no no you

1637
02:20:45,400 --> 02:20:49,480
wouldn't this is gonna be one of those ironic things where they're gonna have

1638
02:20:49,480 --> 02:20:54,160
this whole battle it's like that movie um what is it citizen Ruth it's just

1639
02:20:54,160 --> 02:20:57,240
like that movie it's a big abortion should she or should she not have an

1640
02:20:57,240 --> 02:21:00,800
abortion and then at the end she miscarries it's gonna be one of those

1641
02:21:00,800 --> 02:21:05,460
type of things where like she's gonna end up she's gonna like roll and fall

1642
02:21:05,460 --> 02:21:08,960
out of her bed and get like kill herself that way or something it's gonna be one

1643
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:12,440
of those like really tragic things after this big huge fight something else will

1644
02:21:12,440 --> 02:21:18,260
happen that's my prediction you heard it here at any rate one way or another she

1645
02:21:18,260 --> 02:21:23,900
shouldn't have to her her husband should not be made to suffer watching basically

1646
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:29,620
this joke of his wife be kept on life support there's no reason for it and I

1647
02:21:29,620 --> 02:21:33,220
feel really bad for him you know and then her family you know her parents

1648
02:21:33,220 --> 02:21:38,100
are holding on to fault hope she's not waking up you know if they if they truly

1649
02:21:38,100 --> 02:21:48,400
loved her they would let her go yeah let's end on an agreement please she

1650
02:21:48,400 --> 02:21:54,060
needs to die one way or another please let's end on an agreement all right

1651
02:21:54,060 --> 02:21:55,060
Nice to be killed.

1652
02:21:55,060 --> 02:21:56,060
Any other FUs, Jamie?

1653
02:21:56,060 --> 02:21:57,060
Break her neck.

1654
02:21:57,060 --> 02:21:58,060
Um.

1655
02:21:58,060 --> 02:21:59,060
What?

1656
02:21:59,060 --> 02:22:00,060
Roll so fast.

1657
02:22:00,060 --> 02:22:04,420
I say we give her the log treatment.

1658
02:22:04,420 --> 02:22:05,820
No, that's bad.

1659
02:22:05,820 --> 02:22:06,820
No, seriously.

1660
02:22:06,820 --> 02:22:09,900
Um, my other FUs, I really don't have any.

1661
02:22:09,900 --> 02:22:12,420
That's just really been sort of my inferior- Oh, yeah?

1662
02:22:12,420 --> 02:22:15,260
Um, fuck you to the worm in Silent Hill 3.

1663
02:22:15,260 --> 02:22:16,260
Ew.

1664
02:22:16,260 --> 02:22:17,740
And I'm done.

1665
02:22:17,740 --> 02:22:18,740
Alright.

1666
02:22:18,740 --> 02:22:19,740
Okay, afterthought.

1667
02:22:19,740 --> 02:22:20,900
Revive Jeffrey Dahmer.

1668
02:22:20,900 --> 02:22:21,900
Have him go at it.

1669
02:22:21,900 --> 02:22:22,900
Oh, my God.

1670
02:22:22,900 --> 02:22:23,900
You guys are weird.

1671
02:22:23,900 --> 02:22:27,900
Okay, let's go. Um, let's go to Loki.

1672
02:22:27,900 --> 02:22:32,900
Don't acknowledge that with a comment on air, please.

1673
02:22:32,900 --> 02:22:37,900
All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this. Where is the status of Florida, right?

1674
02:22:37,900 --> 02:22:44,900
Dude, do we need any more proof? I mean, come on. They're the ones that's gonna bring upon the end of the world with zombies.

1675
02:22:44,900 --> 02:22:49,900
The whole thing is the Republicans trying to one-up the Democrats. That's all it is. It's power play.

1676
02:22:49,900 --> 02:22:52,700
It's because it's in Florida, and that's where, you know...

1677
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:55,400
And there's, you know, jabs in charge there.

1678
02:22:55,400 --> 02:23:02,100
Okay, 100,000 people died in a tsunami in January, and we are all hung up on this joke.

1679
02:23:02,100 --> 02:23:06,400
Yeah, but did any of them turn into zombies? That's what I want to know.

1680
02:23:06,400 --> 02:23:07,400
I don't know.

1681
02:23:07,400 --> 02:23:15,900
At any rate, at any rate, you know, the body, true, it can live without cognitive function, but that doesn't necessarily constitute life.

1682
02:23:15,900 --> 02:23:20,100
you know what's gonna happen they're gonna pull out that goddamn tube she's

1683
02:23:20,100 --> 02:23:25,140
gonna breathe and it starts there I seriously cannot take this topic anymore

1684
02:23:25,140 --> 02:23:30,540
please I think behind it is just that the Republicans are trying to wind up

1685
02:23:30,540 --> 02:23:38,300
the Democrats that's all it is okay all right anyways so here's here's my

1686
02:23:38,300 --> 02:23:42,500
solution to the whole problem we should have America because America can make

1687
02:23:42,500 --> 02:23:46,180
great decisions like choosing the american idol we should have them vote

1688
02:23:46,180 --> 02:23:50,540
on how she died now this can be anywhere from like being shot out of a cannon

1689
02:23:50,540 --> 02:23:53,980
to drop from a plane, space shuttle, mirror

1690
02:23:53,980 --> 02:23:58,340
I mean it doesn't really matter just you know have her die because she can't feel pain

1691
02:23:58,340 --> 02:24:02,420
I mean might as well contribute to society she cannot she's brain dead

1692
02:24:02,420 --> 02:24:06,580
okay I'll put it this way her nervous system

1693
02:24:06,580 --> 02:24:10,780
can register a pain response but her brain does not understand

1694
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:13,780
that she is in pain because there's nothing there!

1695
02:24:13,780 --> 02:24:16,780
How about we poke her and then she goes OW!

1696
02:24:16,780 --> 02:24:18,780
Then we'll know that she can feel pain.

1697
02:24:18,780 --> 02:24:20,780
Well, tough, then she's not feeling pain.

1698
02:24:20,780 --> 02:24:21,780
She's not there!

1699
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:24,780
Okay, so that's enough of that.

1700
02:24:24,780 --> 02:24:26,780
We're gonna have a heart attack and then we're gonna have a fight.

1701
02:24:26,780 --> 02:24:28,780
How is she gonna kill us?

1702
02:24:28,780 --> 02:24:31,780
Well, he's already dead. He's not a zombie.

1703
02:24:31,780 --> 02:24:32,780
Rob, I promise you.

1704
02:24:32,780 --> 02:24:33,780
I think we should chop off her head.

1705
02:24:33,780 --> 02:24:37,780
If every cat's on life support with a tube in your stomach, we'll let you go.

1706
02:24:37,780 --> 02:24:39,780
You pull that fucking tube out. I don't want to be a vegetable.

1707
02:24:39,780 --> 02:24:45,480
be a vegetable. That's right, you know out. No, I already said this. I decree this. If

1708
02:24:45,480 --> 02:24:51,140
I am in that state, I want you to fling, I want to be put in a catapult, and I want to

1709
02:24:51,140 --> 02:24:55,460
be flung against a glass building. Flung at the White House. No, I want to be flung at

1710
02:24:55,460 --> 02:25:00,700
a glass building. I want to be flung at the Apple Building during lunch hour. That would

1711
02:25:00,700 --> 02:25:04,940
be rad. That is my request, thank you. Can we dress you up in all matching clothes so

1712
02:25:04,940 --> 02:25:12,620
that you know you can match your ipod or one of the one of the things is that she

1713
02:25:12,620 --> 02:25:16,300
had actually been witnessing that she would never want to be maintained on life support

1714
02:25:18,700 --> 02:25:27,500
anyway seriously loki that comment oh my god i only on this show i i i and we still don't get

1715
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:31,980
hate mail that is the amazing thing we don't get hate mail over comments like that i am the voice

1716
02:25:31,980 --> 02:25:39,740
of the people what can I say anyways so further FUs of the week go to bad

1717
02:25:39,740 --> 02:25:43,460
drivers especially people that don't know how to drive in rain because when

1718
02:25:43,460 --> 02:25:47,240

1811
02:33:24,160 --> 02:33:27,160
Almost like, you know, kind of like a ventriloquist doll.

1812
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:35,160
They could like, you know, tie her to like bars and stuff so, you know, they could have someone do a tap dance and she does a tap dance.

1813
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:41,160
I think we need to go to a break. Oh my gosh.

1814
02:33:42,160 --> 02:33:48,160
In this break, I want to show some keyboard mania love in this break because I just, I want to hear some keyboard mania songs.

1815
02:33:48,160 --> 02:33:54,160

02:34:03,160 --> 02:34:05,160
We're going to do a mix of music in this break.

02:34:05,160 --> 02:34:07,160
Because I really want to play a Mambo A Go-Go song too.

02:40:20,240 --> 02:40:28,200
Hello, and we're back, boys and girls. Don't forget, you can send in your questions right

1845
02:40:28,200 --> 02:40:33,360
now for Ask Orange Lounge, because we're going to be getting to that shortly, so we always

1846
02:40:33,360 --> 02:40:36,040
want to hear the questions that you have. If you want to ask us about Bamani, if you

1847
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:42,000
want to ask us about Ditter or 2DX or whatever, Keyboard Mania. Hey, I used to be pretty good

1848
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,800
at Keyboard Mania, little known fact. I used to be pretty good at it. I wasn't like blue

1849
02:40:45,800 --> 02:40:52,080
good, but I was pretty good. I could hold my own. So, if you've got questions on that,

1850
02:40:52,080 --> 02:40:56,240
we'd love to hear them, or just general questions. We may not be able to get to everything, but

1851
02:40:56,240 --> 02:41:01,080
we, you know, do encourage you to think hard about a question you would like us to answer.

1852

Also, just a reminder about the podcast, we have a downloadable 25 to 30 minute show,

1853
02:41:06,040 --> 02:41:10,220
lately it's been more like 30 minutes, that you can download any time you want. It's like

1854
02:41:10,220 --> 02:41:15,120
audio blogging. Just because it's called a podcast, doesn't mean you need an iPod to

1855
02:41:15,120 --> 02:41:19,920
to listen. You just need whatever media player you're using to listen to the show right now.

02:43:22,680 --> 02:43:32,600
icon. Hm, what else? Hm, yeah people. Anyone get a AAA on Legend of Max? And that is our

1876
02:43:32,600 --> 02:43:35,340
Are DDR free posts of the week?

1877
02:43:35,340 --> 02:43:37,820
Technically, yes it is possible.

1878
02:43:37,820 --> 02:43:42,100
If it's sex, and it's DDR, chances are Loki knows about it.

1879
02:43:42,100 --> 02:43:45,680
It would be possible, and this is the only way how, because it's very, it would be very

1880
02:43:45,680 --> 02:43:47,900
difficult to have sex on DDR.

1881
02:43:47,900 --> 02:43:52,060
You would have to probably be playing Disney Mix, and you'd have to play Mickey Mouse March

1882
02:43:52,060 --> 02:43:54,140
because it's all left and right arrows.

1883
02:43:54,140 --> 02:43:58,940
So as long as someone is on like a countertop that's placed right next to the pad, you could

1884
02:43:58,940 --> 02:44:03,820
probably be able to step to left and right arrows while thrusting into them. That'd be

1885
02:44:03,820 --> 02:44:06,540
the only way. Otherwise, it's impossible.

1886
02:44:06,540 --> 02:44:10,620
Um, I don't know if you understand the joke about this segment, but you're not actually

1887
02:44:10,620 --> 02:44:19,800
supposed to reply to these posts. Might I say, the post, just as a footnote, the post

1888
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:25,580
was promptly locked in the next post by everyone's favorite admin, Spike. So you're going over

1889
02:44:25,580 --> 02:44:29,780
to someone's house and try to get them to cheat on their boyfriend with you by having

1890
02:44:29,780 --> 02:44:33,060
sex while playing DDR. Sweet Jesus, what's happened to kids these days?

1891
02:44:33,060 --> 02:44:39,860
Lock. I'm just saying it's possible. I'm not saying that anyone should try it because that's

1892
02:44:39,860 --> 02:44:47,340
retarded. DarkSock already had a thought. Just hit the pause button, get it done with,

1893
02:44:47,340 --> 02:44:49,340
Then go back and play.

1894
02:44:52,340 --> 02:44:54,340
There you go.

1895
02:44:58,340 --> 02:45:00,340
God, I love DDR Freak.

1896
02:45:00,340 --> 02:45:02,340
What do we do without DDR Freak?

1897
02:45:02,340 --> 02:45:04,340
We have fun.

1898
02:45:06,340 --> 02:45:09,340
I'm so glad the microphone didn't pick up your little comment.

1899
02:45:11,340 --> 02:45:13,340
No, um, Magus.

1900
02:45:13,340 --> 02:45:29,100
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question. What will we find out this week on Orange

1901
02:45:29,100 --> 02:45:35,620
Lounge Radio? We have some noobs tonight who are asking some questions. I just hope they're

1902
02:45:35,620 --> 02:45:47,020
not as bad as the post on DDR Freak. Why does Orange Lounge have a few syllables in there?

1903
02:45:47,020 --> 02:45:52,260
Is it possible to have sex while listening to Orange Lounge? Yes, but we highly discourage

1904
02:45:52,260 --> 02:45:56,940
it. Yes, but don't tell us about it. Don't be too loud because you won't be able to hear

1905
02:45:56,940 --> 02:46:12,840
the show. When we say F you of the week we don't actually mean F. Starting off, I have

1906
02:46:12,840 --> 02:46:16,280
to ask a follow up question to that because they want us to ask something there. Let's

1907
02:46:16,280 --> 02:46:23,200
go to this next one. VGM. Dear Orange Lounge Radio, do you guys and girls get paid for

1908
02:46:23,200 --> 02:46:34,620
were doing this? No. I wish. What can I say? No, we don't actually at this time. This is

1909
02:46:34,620 --> 02:46:37,960
why you might remember at the beginning of the show I announced that Orange Lounge Radio

1910
02:46:37,960 --> 02:46:43,120
is taking steps to become a business and myself, Jamie and Matt, we are all officially a partnership

1911
02:46:43,120 --> 02:46:51,300
now so you may see some little ads come to the site in the future but no panic please.

1912
02:46:51,300 --> 02:46:58,040
We hate banner ads, we hate pop-ups, so we're trying to think of things where you could

1913
02:46:58,040 --> 02:47:02,320
purchase things from Orange Lounge Radio and it would be stuff you would want and actually

1914
02:47:02,320 --> 02:47:03,680
be interested in.

1915
02:47:03,680 --> 02:47:07,560
We're not going to have free iPod banners and stuff if we can help it.

1916
02:47:07,560 --> 02:47:12,040
I'm not going to say never ever because we might get desperate, but for the time being

1917
02:47:12,040 --> 02:47:13,240
we're not planning on that.

1918
02:47:13,240 --> 02:47:15,480
We hate ads on the internet just like the rest of you.

1919
02:47:15,480 --> 02:47:19,800
We're going to make it all tasteful and maybe someday, yes, we can make money doing this

1920
02:47:19,800 --> 02:47:22,840
because that would be cool. Because who wouldn't want to quit their job and do

1921
02:47:22,840 --> 02:47:30,800
Orange Lawns Radio? Seriously. Illusion says, Orange Lawns Radio question. If

1922
02:47:30,800 --> 02:47:36,520
there were a sequel to be made of any music game, not Bahmani, that is US, such

1923
02:47:36,520 --> 02:47:41,280
as Frequency, Amplitude, or Taiko Drum Master, that doesn't seem like it will

1924
02:47:41,280 --> 02:47:46,760
have a sequel, which one would you want to see a sequel from? Any thoughts on

1925
02:47:46,760 --> 02:48:00,040
this. Magus. Gitaroo Man, hands down. I would like to see another sequel to Bust-A-Move

1926
02:48:00,040 --> 02:48:04,560
Groove, whatever you want to call it. It was Dance Summit. Yeah, but I'd like to see something

1927
02:48:04,560 --> 02:48:09,500
break in the US market. A real Bust-A-Move sequel with all the characters again. Yeah,

1928
02:48:09,500 --> 02:48:12,380
I mean, I'd like to see another one of those, because that was really the game that got

1929
02:48:12,380 --> 02:48:16,220
me into DDR in the first place, I have to correct. And I know it's Jamie's pet peeve

1930
02:48:16,220 --> 02:48:19,280
to call those games Bust a Groove, but when I got into them, that's what I knew them as,

1931
02:48:19,280 --> 02:48:23,140
so I have to call them Bust a Groove. Yes?

1932
02:48:23,140 --> 02:48:31,140
I know, more, um, uh, Puyo Da. That's not a U.S. game, though, is it?

1933
02:48:31,140 --> 02:48:34,780
Puyo Da needs to come out in the U.S., then. All right, Loki?

1934
02:48:34,780 --> 02:48:40,260
I have a serious and unserious one. Serious one would be a Rez sequel, and...

1935
02:48:40,260 --> 02:48:45,500
Oh, God, yes, I didn't even think of that. And, and, and the unserious one would be whatever

1936
02:48:45,500 --> 02:48:52,500
Remember it was that Aerosmith game where you fight with CDs? Revolution X2. We should

1937
02:48:52,580 --> 02:48:59,580
make a Revolution X2. Wow. It could be versus the RIA this time instead of like, you know,

1938
02:49:01,420 --> 02:49:08,420
the drug dealers and stuff. Alright, um, let's see, moving on. You know what else though?

1939
02:49:08,420 --> 02:49:15,420
Let's see, moving on. Oh, you know what else though? Space Channel 5. I'd love to see another one, because, oh god, I love Ooh La La.

1940
02:49:15,420 --> 02:49:21,420
Revolution X2 starring the Beastie Boys, because they haven't done anything good in a long time.

1941
02:49:21,420 --> 02:49:27,420
There are, however, music games that don't need a sequel. Mad Maestro, Unison, I can't think of any of those.

1942
02:49:27,420 --> 02:49:31,420
Alright. I like Technic Peek. You shut your mouth.

1943
02:49:31,420 --> 02:49:35,420
Lazer1234543 asks,

1944
02:49:35,420 --> 02:49:39,420
Can you play some Taku and give a shout out to my site?

1945
02:49:39,420 --> 02:49:43,420
I hate to break it to you bud, but we actually played not one but TWO Taku songs earlier

1946
02:49:43,420 --> 02:49:47,420
in the show. What we did, Empathy, and I think Karma was the other one.

1947
02:49:47,420 --> 02:49:51,420
Gotta tune in to 630 otherwise you miss them. Sorry. Maybe if we

1948
02:49:51,420 --> 02:49:55,420
have time we'll fit one more in because I know Jamie will always take any excuse to play Taku.

1949
02:49:55,420 --> 02:49:56,420
Yeah.

1950
02:49:56,420 --> 02:49:57,420
Story time with Rob.

1951
02:49:57,420 --> 02:49:58,420
Oh, I know.

1952
02:49:58,420 --> 02:50:00,420
I will get to that, so.

1953
02:50:00,420 --> 02:50:01,420
Sure.

1954
02:50:01,420 --> 02:50:02,420
Let's see.

1955
02:50:02,420 --> 02:50:05,420
Oh, uh, can we give a shout out to my site?

1956
02:50:05,420 --> 02:50:07,660
Sure, but you will have to pay for that.

1957
02:50:07,660 --> 02:50:09,100
Um, no, I'm kidding.

1958
02:50:09,100 --> 02:50:10,100
Sure, why not?

1959
02:50:10,100 --> 02:50:15,900
It's laser123454321.com, but he says it's down right now, but I guess it's, um, step

1960
02:50:15,900 --> 02:50:16,900
mania stuff?

1961
02:50:16,900 --> 02:50:17,900
So, check it out.

1962
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:20,700
I'm sure I've been to it, I just can't remember.

1963
02:50:20,700 --> 02:50:23,300
They all start, you know, running together.

1964
02:50:23,300 --> 02:50:24,540
Your mind is just a big blur.

1965
02:50:24,540 --> 02:50:28,660
I need to go look for the Japanese sites again, because I used to have a bunch of them bookmarked.

1966
02:50:28,660 --> 02:50:32,860
Then they kind of, like, disappeared, and now the new ones are coming back.

1967
02:50:32,860 --> 02:50:34,420
Alright.

1968
02:50:34,420 --> 02:50:40,120
Uh, AsianBuddyPaul says, OrangeLawnsRadio question, I'm a latecomer to Ragnarok Online.

1969
02:50:40,120 --> 02:50:43,900
Why is it so damn addicting? I will defer this question to Jamie.

1970
02:50:43,900 --> 02:50:50,100
You know what, I'm still wondering myself. The only reason that I got out of it was just that I got way too busy to play,

1971
02:50:50,100 --> 02:50:52,320
and now I'm on Final Fantasy XI.

1972
02:50:52,320 --> 02:50:57,040
But you know what's sad is that I've had had second thoughts about reactivating my account

1973
02:50:57,040 --> 02:51:03,720
because I was up to like level 80 something on my assassin.

1974
02:51:03,720 --> 02:51:06,800
Alright, you know why?

1975
02:51:06,800 --> 02:51:13,200
Because it kind of, a lot of the MMOs now are 3D and Ragnarok is 3D to an extent but

1976
02:51:13,200 --> 02:51:17,340
it still has that 2D feel, it has that Secret of Mana feel and I think a lot of folks that

1977
02:51:17,340 --> 02:51:21,440
are into retro gaming have a special love for it for that reason.

1978
02:51:21,440 --> 02:51:31,640
me crazy but I think that's it. MPQ. Why are so many Babani songs rated badly? I know at

1979
02:51:31,640 --> 02:51:39,140
least one song I like that's rated three levels higher than I think it is. What's with that?

1980
02:51:39,140 --> 02:51:45,520
I don't know if he means like how burning the floor ratings. If you're talking about

1981
02:51:45,520 --> 02:51:49,520
Stepmania, that's a whole... people can't write their songs at all there.

1982
02:51:49,520 --> 02:51:56,520
What was that song I was playing earlier this week that was a 13 on Heavy and they had a...

1983
02:51:56,520 --> 02:52:02,520
was it Expert or Extreme or whatever version that was 20 that I was like, this is retarded?

1984
02:52:02,520 --> 02:52:04,520
What's the point?

1985
02:52:05,520 --> 02:52:07,520
Gotta love this.

1986
02:52:09,520 --> 02:52:11,520
Yeah, I don't know.

1987
02:52:11,520 --> 02:52:18,520
Um, why are they, I would say it's because with different mixes you get different developers

1988
02:52:18,520 --> 02:52:22,800
slightly each time so you have different opinions on what songs should be rated. I don't think

1989
02:52:22,800 --> 02:52:28,520
they have a formula or anything, um, so that's the best answer I got.

1990
02:52:28,520 --> 02:52:38,240
Um, SSJ100Matt. I'm actually planning a cross-country trip over the summer and I was thinking of

1991
02:52:38,240 --> 02:52:42,120
visiting your studios along the way back from Phoenix to New York my question is

1992
02:52:42,120 --> 02:52:47,800
if I could visit you guys and be on the show well I don't see why not but this

1993
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:50,960
is the thing we've got a you know we're gonna have to draw the line at some

1994
02:52:50,960 --> 02:52:55,000
point since we're still underground we're cool with our fans visiting us but

1995
02:52:55,000 --> 02:52:59,440
one day when we're fucking famous we'll probably still be doing this show out of

1996
02:52:59,440 --> 02:53:02,360
our apartment and so I have to have a little bit of caution about you know

1997
02:53:02,360 --> 02:53:05,880
who's coming in and who's not actually we don't want the paparazzi coming we

1998
02:53:05,880 --> 02:53:10,920
We don't want the damn paparazzi in here. Which is really funny because we could have

1999
02:53:10,920 --> 02:53:15,760
the paparazzi in here in the near future. Remember back in the day when we used to have

2000
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:19,400
all the people that listened to our show come in, they were like, why is our listenership

2001
02:53:19,400 --> 02:53:24,600
down? I was like, because everyone's here. No, I don't see why not. I mean, let us know

2002
02:53:24,600 --> 02:53:29,160
what time frame you'll be here. But in the future, I don't want everybody thinking that

2003
02:53:29,160 --> 02:53:34,840
they could come. We are going to try and make more public appearances at conventions in

2004
02:53:34,840 --> 02:53:37,160
the Bay Area and stuff. That's going to be part of our, like, trying to get our name

2005
02:53:37,160 --> 02:53:41,120
out of that stuff. We almost did it this weekend. We were going to do RekkaCon, but I had to

2006
02:53:41,120 --> 02:53:48,600
back out for other reasons, so. I'm sorry. Anyway. Um, so as, yes, you're special since

2007
02:53:48,600 --> 02:53:54,280
you asked right now. You can visit us. Just, uh, send one of us an email. Either Rob or

2008
02:53:54,280 --> 02:54:00,040
Jamie or Matt at orangelandtrader.com and we will hook you up. And it's loki at orangelandtrader.com.

2009
02:54:00,040 --> 02:54:03,040
Matt auto-forwards to Loki anyways, it doesn't matter.

2010
02:54:03,040 --> 02:54:07,040
I get a bunch of spam. A lot of people, a lot of spammers know where my address is.

2011
02:54:07,040 --> 02:54:11,040
I think you can do darksaccharide at forwards to Jamie, which ends up forwarding to our other address,

2012
02:54:11,040 --> 02:54:14,040
and you can do Rob or Skye, and I think it all works, but...

2013
02:54:14,040 --> 02:54:17,040
Rob is what's on the business cards, so that's why I wanted to do that.

2014
02:54:17,040 --> 02:54:21,040
No one sends me mail, except for the one time when, you know, they sent me mail because I asked for mail,

2015
02:54:21,040 --> 02:54:25,040
but no one sends me mail, they're in spammers, and it looks like Matrix online today, but...

2016
02:54:25,040 --> 02:54:28,040
Send Loki some email, you guys. Send him, send him some email.

2017
02:54:28,040 --> 02:54:34,560
them some email. Honestly, I need to get rid of spam. I need a new email address. Alright,

2018
02:54:34,560 --> 02:54:40,520
we'll see. Alright, it looks like that's all the questions we got for right now, so I'm

2019
02:54:40,520 --> 02:54:46,960
going to close up the Ask Orange Lounge segment, so thank you guys for participating there.

2020
02:54:46,960 --> 02:54:52,800
Angel reminded me to mention something funny that happened yesterday. We were playing DDR,

2021
02:54:52,800 --> 02:54:55,800
because I mentioned I went to the bowling alley that's open 24 hours, and I was playing

2022
02:54:55,800 --> 02:55:00,000
in the groove, and they also have DDR. And I don't know why, if it's just because I'm

2023
02:55:00,000 --> 02:55:04,320
kinda... I don't want to say I'm bored with DDR, but I'm at the point where it's just

2024
02:55:04,320 --> 02:55:09,120
like, I always just do roulette every time when I pick my song, because I guess that

2025
02:55:09,120 --> 02:55:13,160
helps me get a break outside the box a little bit and play songs I wouldn't usually play.

2026
02:55:13,160 --> 02:55:20,280
So I was doing roulette every time. And, um, for Extra Stage, I did it as well. I did roulette

2027
02:55:20,280 --> 02:55:26,920
on my extra stage. Remember, extra stage is reverse 1.5 speed because I secretly don't

2028
02:55:26,920 --> 02:55:31,600
like doing Legend of Max because I really can't pass it because I'm old and it's too

2029
02:55:31,600 --> 02:55:37,040
fast and it's just too much for me. So call me a sucky DDR player, I don't care, but I

2030
02:55:37,040 --> 02:55:42,240
can't pass Legend of Max extra stage. It's just too much. Too much stamina. So I do 1.5

2031
02:55:42,240 --> 02:55:49,040
reverse and guess what song I end up with? BAG as my extra stage. And it lands on BAG

2032
02:55:49,040 --> 02:55:50,620
and all I hear is angels start going,

2033
02:55:50,620 --> 02:55:52,200
AH HA HA HA!

2034
02:55:52,200 --> 02:55:55,380
AH HA HA HA! SUCKS TO BE YOU!

2035
02:55:55,380 --> 02:55:58,620
I didn't know that, I said, NOOOO!

2036
02:55:58,620 --> 02:56:00,420
You were totally pointing and laughing at me.

2037
02:56:00,420 --> 02:56:03,900
The sad thing is, I actually did it, and I was kinda doing it for a little while,

2038
02:56:03,900 --> 02:56:04,820
but then I was like,

2039
02:56:04,820 --> 02:56:08,940
I'm too old, and I quit. I don't, I don't hold onto the bar or anything, and I'm not

2040
02:56:08,940 --> 02:56:09,740
saying

2041
02:56:09,740 --> 02:56:12,960
I'm against bar raping, I'm just, I personally am not a

2042
02:56:12,960 --> 02:56:16,180
bar holder player type.

2043
02:56:16,180 --> 02:56:20,420
Next time you consider bar raping, think of the bar.

2044
02:56:20,420 --> 02:56:24,900
What did the bar do to you, huh?

2045
02:56:24,900 --> 02:56:30,700
Anyway, I guess it's that time to start thinking about wrapping up this program.

2046
02:56:30,700 --> 02:56:34,860
Thank you guys for tuning in tonight, and we hope to see you next week, but we can't

2047
02:56:34,860 --> 02:56:37,700
end it until we get our final thoughts.

2048
02:56:37,700 --> 02:56:41,500
Magus, your final thought.

2049
02:56:41,500 --> 02:56:46,200
Needs more nachos, and possibly a little more cowbell.

2050
02:56:46,200 --> 02:56:47,200
Angel!

2051
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:51,380
No more bag on roulette.

2052
02:56:51,380 --> 02:56:53,140
Um...

2053
02:56:53,140 --> 02:56:57,100
Uh, Nellie, do you have a final thought?

2054
02:56:57,100 --> 02:57:00,540
Do you really want me to talk about the dead woman again? Sure. No, I'm just kidding.

2055
02:57:00,540 --> 02:57:02,400
Alright. Loki, your final thought?

2056
02:57:02,400 --> 02:57:09,400
Um, listen to the podcast where you'll hear more about my dog throwing poop on stuff.

2057
02:57:09,400 --> 02:57:22,400
And Dark, oh my final thought, I'll let you have last. My final thought is, um, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay. You are the ones who are the ball lickers. DarkSakura, your final thought.

2058
02:57:28,400 --> 02:57:31,400
Do you know me? I am so famous.

2059
02:57:32,400 --> 02:57:37,400
Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show. Thank you guys so much for tuning in, supporting and listening.

2060
02:57:37,400 --> 02:57:44,400
Um, Magus, you get tonight's final word. One word to sum it all up.

2061
02:57:44,400 --> 02:57:49,400
Veggies!

2062
02:57:49,400 --> 02:57:54,400

2066
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:15,120
We did it all.

2067
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:16,120
We did it all.

2068
02:58:16,120 --> 02:58:19,600
Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills,

2069
02:58:19,600 --> 02:58:22,120
ludes, coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?

2070
02:58:22,120 --> 02:58:23,120
That's what we did.

2071
02:58:23,120 --> 02:58:24,600
People go, well why don't you go into rehab?

2072
02:58:24,600 --> 02:58:27,060
We didn't have rehab back in the 70s.

2073
02:58:27,060 --> 02:58:30,000
in the 70s rehab meant you'd stop doing coke but you kept smoking pot and

2074
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,260
drinking for a couple more weeks you know yeah give me a case of Budweiser

2075
02:58:33,260 --> 02:58:36,680
on an ounce I gotta slow down Jesus Christ I'm out of control look at the

2076
02:58:36,680 --> 02:58:40,100
size of my pants for Christ's sake

2077
02:58:42,300 --> 02:58:46,820
that's the big thing now rehab is the big fucking secret now isn't it huh yeah

2078
02:58:46,820 --> 02:58:49,020
you can do whatever you want just going to rehab and solve your problems and

2079
02:58:49,020 --> 02:58:52,100
that's a big celebrity thing that's what I'm gonna do yeah I'm gonna get famous

2080
02:58:52,100 --> 02:58:56,440
then my career starts to flag I'm gonna go on a three-month fucking bender okay

2081
02:58:56,440 --> 02:59:00,940
Coke and fuckin' pot and smack and fuckin' booze and drive over people and beat up my kids

2082
02:59:00,940 --> 02:59:04,440
Go into therapy, go into rehab, come out of rehab, be on the cover of People magazine

2083
02:59:04,440 --> 02:59:05,440
Sorry!

2084
02:59:07,440 --> 02:59:08,440
I fucked up!

2085
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:14,440
That's what they do, man, they go into rehab and they come out and they blame everybody except themselves

2086
02:59:14,440 --> 02:59:15,440
They blame their parents, right?

2087
02:59:15,440 --> 02:59:18,440
That's the way everybody comes from a dysfunctional family all of a sudden, huh?

2088
02:59:18,440 --> 02:59:20,440
Roseanne Barr comes from a dysfunctional family

2089
02:59:20,440 --> 02:59:22,440
Not Roseanne, she seems so normal to me

2090
02:59:22,440 --> 02:59:28,760
The Jacksons were dysfunctional, not the Jacksons!

2091
02:59:28,760 --> 02:59:34,920
These people give each other new heads for Christmas, for Christ's sake!

2092
02:59:34,920 --> 02:59:38,460
I am sick and tired of hearing that fucking speech, you know?

2093
02:59:38,460 --> 02:59:41,880
These people come out of rehab and they always have the same story, well, you know, I became

2094
02:59:41,880 --> 02:59:46,340
an alcoholic because my parents didn't love me, you know, and I became a junkie because

2095
02:59:46,340 --> 02:59:50,420
my parents didn't love me enough, and I wanted the hypnosis and therapy and I found out that

2096
02:59:50,420 --> 02:59:55,240
my parents used to hit me, hey, my parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay?

2097
02:59:55,240 --> 02:59:58,520
And looking back on it, I'm glad they did it, I'm looking forward to beating the shit

2098
02:59:58,520 --> 03:00:06,020
out of my kids, aren't you? For no reason whatsoever, what'd you hit me for? Shut up

2099
03:00:06,020 --> 03:00:09,660
and get out there and mow the lawn, for Christ's sake. There's therapy for you, mowing the

2100
03:00:09,660 --> 03:00:16,580
lawn and crying at the same time. The Leary kids in therapy again, their lawn looks great,

2101
03:00:16,580 --> 03:00:27,060
unbelievable. I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy. I'm just not happy because my life

2102
03:00:27,060 --> 03:00:32,460
didn't turn out the way I thought it would. Hey, join the fucking club, okay? I thought

2103
03:00:32,460 --> 03:00:35,860
I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox. Life sucks. Get a

2104
03:00:35,860 --> 03:00:44,900
fucking helmet, all right? I'm not happy. I'm not happy. Nobody's happy, okay? Happiness

2105
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:49,220
comes in small doses folks it's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm

2106
03:00:49,220 --> 03:00:52,900
that's it okay you come you eat the cookie you smoke the butt you go to sleep you get up in the

2107
03:00:52,900 --> 03:00:56,980
morning and go to fucking work okay that is it end the fucking list

2108
03:00:59,940 --> 03:01:05,860
and just be a happy shut the fuck up all right that's the name of my new book shut the fuck up

2109
03:01:05,860 --> 03:01:11,620
by dr dennis larry a revolutionary new form of therapy i'm gonna have my patients come in

2110
03:01:11,620 --> 03:01:13,680
and doctor, I shut the fuck up next.

2111
03:01:14,580 --> 03:01:17,820
I don't feel so, shut the fuck up next.

2112
03:01:17,820 --> 03:01:20,140
He made me feel so much better about myself, you know.

2113
03:01:20,140 --> 03:01:21,460
He just told me to shut the fuck up

2114
03:01:21,460 --> 03:01:22,740
and nobody had ever told me that before.

2115
03:01:22,740 --> 03:01:24,100
I feel so much better now.

2116
03:01:25,780 --> 03:01:27,600
Whining fucking maggots.

2117
03:01:30,300 --> 03:01:31,260
And all these people quitting.

2118
03:01:31,260 --> 03:01:32,840
I think it's a good thing, AA,

2119
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:33,780
and the recovery and rehab,

2120
03:01:33,780 --> 03:01:34,620
because I've got some friends

2121
03:01:34,620 --> 03:01:35,740
who would be dead without those programs,

2122
03:01:35,740 --> 03:01:36,980
but you know something, now we have a different problem,

2123
03:01:36,980 --> 03:01:38,360
because now they quit drinking and drugs.

2124
03:01:38,360 --> 03:01:41,460
They're completely stressed out and they decide to work out,

2125
03:01:41,460 --> 03:01:43,380
Which is fine, I'm not a workout guy,

2126
03:01:43,380 --> 03:01:44,980
but I understood Nautilus, it made sense.

2127
03:01:44,980 --> 03:01:46,840
There were arm machines and leg machines,

2128
03:01:46,840 --> 03:01:47,980
but have you seen these people

2129
03:01:47,980 --> 03:01:50,140
who are using the stair master, huh?

2130
03:01:50,140 --> 03:01:53,100
Have we turned into gerbils, ladies and gentlemen?

2131
03:01:53,100 --> 03:01:54,860
People are paying money to go into a health club

2132
03:01:54,860 --> 03:01:56,700
and walk up invisible steps over and over again

2133
03:01:56,700 --> 03:01:57,700
for an hour and a half.

2134
03:01:57,700 --> 03:01:58,520
Where are you going?

2135
03:01:58,520 --> 03:02:00,380
I'm going up, and I paid for it too.

2136
03:02:00,380 --> 03:02:02,060
I can stay here as long as I want, folks.

2137
03:02:02,060 --> 03:02:03,060
You wanna go up and down stairs,

2138
03:02:03,060 --> 03:02:06,100
move into a fifth floor, walk up on the Lower East Side, okay?

2139
03:02:06,100 --> 03:02:07,780
What's next, a fucking chair master?

2140
03:02:07,780 --> 03:02:09,420
I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up, I sit down,

2141
03:02:09,420 --> 03:02:11,140
I get up, the door master, I open the door,

2142
03:02:11,140 --> 03:02:21,140
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2143
03:02:41,140 --> 03:02:53,340
Sorry, I fucked up!

2144
03:02:53,340 --> 03:02:58,260
Alright, a lovely fortune cookie as always from Dark Sakura.

2145
03:02:58,260 --> 03:03:02,900
We are signing off, we're going to go back to our basic broadcast so we can go tape ourselves

2146
03:03:02,900 --> 03:03:05,100
a podcast.

2147
03:03:05,100 --> 03:03:09,060
Tune in next week boys and girls, actually you know what, just fucking tune in 24-7 because

2148
03:03:09,060 --> 03:03:11,340
Because we got lots of cool shit on the station.

2149
03:03:11,340 --> 03:03:14,940
So reconnect in about 15 seconds, because we're going to dump your asses because I want

2150
03:03:14,940 --> 03:03:16,460
my computer back.
