Wait until you see now

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,820
Though I

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,900
are tired of of

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:12,060
The envisioning it

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,080
Iahaka

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:17,100
Does

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,500
That

8
00:00:20,520 --> 00:00:21,520
Not

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,160

I've been so nice to you, you are with me now

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:54,400
Yes, it's true, I love you so much

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,400
Baby, I'll never be able to get up on you

18
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:10,400
So never say goodbye and get me once again

19
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,400
Kiki-chan machi wa ae kau de wo suge

Omae no kou kou no no asite ala oka

27
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,400
You can't do this alone

28
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
Ash, you can't do this alone

29
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:54,400
You can't do this alone

30
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,400
Get it, get it, for your love

31
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
You don't have to hit me

32
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:56,900
Hey!

33
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,900
Get yourself off

34
00:05:58,900 --> 00:05:59,400
Hey!

35
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:01,400
You know you have a plan

36
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,900
Hey!

37
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,900
So get away from here

38
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,900
Cause you're easy to lose

39
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,400
So get away from here

40
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,900
You're not easy to lose

41
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:15,400
Hey!

42
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Cause you're easy to lose

43
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,400
So get away from here

44
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,900
I can't lose you, baby

45
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,140
Can't go wrong for yourself

46
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:30,900

We are live and this is episode number 134 for this March 6, 2005.

58
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:57,180
You're tuned into the B-Money scene's most sickly radio station of all things B-Money.

59
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,220
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

60
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:06,320
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts who are getting wired up for sound currently

61
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:07,320
as we speak.

62
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:12,320
I have to find the long microphone. I can't tell which one's which.

63
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,320
It's all good. We're kind of getting prepared at the last minute, as usual.

64
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:22,320
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura.

65
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
Hi.

66
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:28,320
Hello, and just so you guys know, Dark Sakura's a little...

67
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:31,320
I have a respiratory virus, thank you.

68
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,320
Yeah, so she's kind of...

69
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
Leave it to yourself.

70
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:41,320
It's the same crap I had two weeks ago. I just decided to, you know, reinstate itself.

71
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:47,320
It's like, hi, I'm still here, and I'm gonna settle in your lungs and make you really short of breath.

72
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,320
All the time.

73
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:53,320
So if you wonder why Jamie's a little kind of...

74
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Why I sound like I'm 80?

75
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,320
Hello, dearies! Your little dears bite my ass.

76
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,320
Damn those kids!

77
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,040
I'll get you if you're a little dog too.

78
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:18,400
Just know that she's being a good sport by showing up in the face of infection tonight.

79
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,080
And she may very well barf up a lung.

80
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,080
And if that happens...

81
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:25,060
No, but I've been copying up plenty of lung cookies, thank you.

82
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,080
If that happens, you can catch it live on our webcam at OrangeLunchRadio.com.

83
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,400
I'll mail it to you.

84
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:31,680
Maybe we could give it away a surprise tonight.

85
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,360
When a little piece of Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,160
Free lung cookie with every tune in.

87
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:40,960
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

88
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,200
Hi. Hi.

89
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:48,280
And not coughing up lung cookies tonight. No, I'm hungry

90
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:51,520
and my, the dishes just got washed

91
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:55,880
so I gotta cook more rice.

92
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:59,720
So maybe you might be baking cookies later for food, I don't know.

93
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:09,040
no cooking right okay they're not cooking I want cookies I'm sorry cookies

94
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:14,840

95
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,720
well girl scout cookies are fucking evil okay I could not even evil Oh Girl

96
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,080
Scouts are not evil they are too they fucking harass me when I try to go shop

97
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:30,180
for groceries. We want your money! For really shitty cookies! Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme!

98
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:33,700
I'm just like, stay away bitch! I will hurt you!

99
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:40,000
I have an entire box of Samoas locked in my drawer at work. And they will be consumed

100
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:43,920
on my next cheat day, the entire box. I don't think I'm going to let that go.

101
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,640
I've already torn through about half a box today, so I'm quite proud of myself.

102
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,600
I want a cookie! Okay, I can get you a cookie.

103
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,240
I've had few enough carbs today that I can afford a cookie.

104
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,140
a cookie

105
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:58,420
girl scout scouts are not even made the parents of girl scouts

106
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:01,220
people i've got

107
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:06,160
i think approximately about four and a half pounds of gummy bears left

108
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,780
thirty that is a big aspect

109
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,580
bag of

110
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:13,300
coming there's one time i left them in my car and the whole thing melted like

111
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,540
the bottom half

112
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:17,200
that was cool because it was like eating gummy

113
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:21,100
like giant gummy i don't know it was a coming up there

114
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:25,100
a gummy breast implant or something.

115
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Wouldn't it be great if they actually made breast implants out of gummy material?

116
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:35,100
No.

117
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Although they would smell nice and fruity.

118
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:47,100
Let's finish up the intros here so we can get to a break here and then start the real show.

119
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:51,100
Also joining us, say hello to DDR Angel.

120
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:53,100
Hello, geez, see?

121
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:57,100
I missed one week and I missed comments like that.

122
00:14:57,100 --> 00:15:00,100
The gummy implant free, DDR Angel, by the way.

123
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:02,100
Indeed.

124
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:05,100
Alright, so we've got an interesting show for you guys tonight.

125
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:10,100
It's gonna be interesting because all the news this week has nothing to do with DDR.

126
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:12,100
So, it should be interesting.

127
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,100
I'm sure I'll dig up something.

128
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,100
Yeah, we'll find something, but...

129
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:19,940
There was a, you know what's funny too, is there was a lot of news, like, after the show

130
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:27,020
Sunday night and Monday, and, so, it almost seems like old news now, but for those of

131
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
you guys that...

132
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:30,220
You know what the greatest news, though, that I've heard all week?

133
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:31,220
What?

134
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,920
Ultron got served.

135
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:39,700
All this and more when we come back from this break, featuring some, eh, Beatmania songs.

136
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:42,340
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

138
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:14,340
And I don't have a choice

139
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:17,840
Why do you think that I need to be your sweet little boy?

140
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,340
I've never fallen on the radio

141
00:16:21,340 --> 00:16:24,840
And thought you'd have to sing it for you

142
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:28,840
But if you fall on the radio

143
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:32,340
You will feel the magic too

144
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:35,340
Operator, operator

145
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:39,340
You took the answers, I never asked the answer for mine

146
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:42,340
Operator, operator

147
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,340

149
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,340

no excuse why is that you've seen the shit they do during their hell week oh my god

171
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,680
i've i've heard stories but you know i've never being having to tread water for 15 minutes in

172
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:18,920
in your underwear in really cold water. That's hot. And then having to do sit-ups in cold

173
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:27,480
water, and then lifting logs, and lifting boats. What rolls downstairs tops over in

174
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,860
pairs, runs over your neighbor's house. It was pretty vicious. And then only getting

175
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:38,920
two meals a day. And then having it be MREs at that. And having to get up early. Ugh.

176
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:45,920
to bed around, what was it, 11? Getting up to 4.30 in the morning?

177
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:57,920
Oh, horrible. The horrible part of eating the MREs. They're not always yummy.

178
00:23:57,920 --> 00:24:03,920
From what I hear. So, anything else in your TV watching excitement adventures?

179
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:12,920
No. I want someone to come to my house though and give me a nautilus. That was really cool.

180
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:20,920
I just came in and there's a show called House Calls. They go in and give this guy all this equipment and teach him how to work out and then leave.

181
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:25,920
It's like, hey, come in my house and give me some extra equipment. I'll take that for free.

182
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,920
Where would you put that? Behind the main cabinet?

183
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,920
I'll find somewhere.

184
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,920
And then...

185
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,920
Mama Chiltz. She's coughing on my lungs.

186
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,920
Okay, well I hope you feel better.

187
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:40,920
I hope I do too, thank you.

188
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:41,920
Alright.

189
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Uh, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

190
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,920
Um...

191
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,920
My week had much less coughing. Um...

192
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,920
I...

193
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:54,920
What did I do this week?

194
00:24:54,920 --> 00:25:05,920
Not much. I played The Law of Final Fantasy. I watched Robot Chicken again, because it's hilarious.

195
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:08,920
And then, um...

196
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:11,920
I did not think the second week of Robot Chicken was nearly as funny as the first.

197
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:17,920
It wasn't as funny as the... I gotta get... I gotta watch the third episode to kinda get a feel for, like, you know,

198
00:25:17,920 --> 00:25:22,920
whether that was just a bad episode, or whether the first one was a really good episode.

199
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:26,360
episode yeah the first one was really really good to hook us all in and now

200
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:32,680
the rest of it's gonna suck it wasn't awful but it wasn't hilarious I had its

201
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,240
moment at least it's not like what was an American dad where the first episode

202
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,000
sucked yes I'm all looking good I'll take the new episode the family guy and

203
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:47,680
that's it so yeah I've basically been doing that I've got the movie Appleseed

204
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:53,760
and I watched the whole thing for that and that's really awesome and now work

205
00:25:53,760 --> 00:26:01,200
I'm sort of playing brand manager for pioneer to try to get this I'm trying to

206
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,280
get them to give me a thousand dollars to screen the movie at our theater at

207
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:14,600
work because that's how much it's gonna cost for pizzas hello give me money give

208
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:20,680
me a thousand dollars okay yeah I don't know if that's gonna fly but you know

209
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:25,480
I'm trying to help them out you know and they're gonna want to sell this movie

210
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,840
and get people to come and see the screen they're gonna have to have food

211
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:35,380
so and it's not cheap to feed 170 people for those that don't know what apple

212
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:39,000
seeds all about because gasps not everyone watches anime what what is that

213
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:46,000
Apple Seed is a fully CG anime movie that's all motion-captured, so it's really cool-looking.

214
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,000
And it's playing in the Bay Area.

215
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:55,000
So, I got to finally finish watching that today, and it was really neat.

216
00:26:55,000 --> 00:27:01,000
I've never actually watched the original anime, so I couldn't really say, you know, how different it was.

217
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:07,280
then yesterday we went myself and my fiancee Nellie went and looked for

218
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:12,360
apartments because our lease is up here pretty soon and we about seven weeks

219
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:18,560
left in this studio and we have one and we found it we're moving in on the 16th

220
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:23,960
of April oh wow so just because they can't hold that off any longer but

221
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:27,280
that's cool because they get the move in over the course of like a week or so so

222
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:32,400
that's cool I'll save me some time and so yeah we've already got that taken

223
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:38,160
care of and that's gonna be interesting and then what else did I do

224
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:44,400
they didn't get the big bag of gummy bears not too much I've been feeling

225
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:49,120
really lazy recently my headaches have been coming back and I think that's

226
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:53,760
because of allergies so it took some day cool both today and yesterday and now

227
00:27:53,760 --> 00:28:00,640
feeling good but uh I don't know oh I actually played um some games I played

228
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:05,920
um alien vs. predator on my main cabinet and played all the way through on Sunday

229
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:13,720
night so I've actually used the main cabinet for something and yeah that's

230
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,680
pretty much it

231
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:22,680
I did play something else. Lots and lots of Tekken 5.

232
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,680
The game is infuriatingly hard on easy mode.

233
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:27,680
It is pretty challenging on easy mode even.

234
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:30,680
But the endings are hilarious.

235
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,680
And I suck at fighting games, so I've only beaten it with two characters so far.

236
00:28:34,680 --> 00:28:39,680
I forgot, I was going to bring it from my memory card to give you the endings, because I've got almost all of them.

237
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:44,920
the other thing I forgot I got a registered for e3 and I'm also applying

238
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,440
for games game sales position at our company which I'll probably get because

239
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:52,860
I know the most about games there but I'm sure they're gonna try to fuck with

240
00:28:52,860 --> 00:29:00,520
me because you know just for some reason I I don't trust this guy that's heading

241
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:05,960
the department I mean he's okay but he's been known to like you know fuck with

242
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:12,200
people for like you know ride your ass on stupid things so I don't know we'll

243
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:15,420
see it I should get it but they're gonna probably try to pull that oh well you

244
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:18,740
don't have enough experience bullshit I've been the company for five years how

245
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:22,100
much fucking experience do I need oh but yet they'll hire someone out of the

246
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:25,620
company you know instantly into the sales position can't wait to hear about

247
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,940
that drama yeah so if I don't get that I'm gonna fucking leave that place

248
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:34,100
because there's no point my position where I'm at right now is gonna be

249
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:37,900
be obsolete pretty soon. So, you know, if they're not going to give me a games position,

250
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:41,980
seeing as I'm the most qualified, the other people that are applying don't know shit about

251
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:48,940
games, they just have console systems at home, so that makes them gamers. And so, you know,

252
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:53,580
it's really retarded, but whatever, you know. So we'll see how that comes down. I'm sure

253
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:58,380
you'll hear more about that next week. They're supposed to be doing the interviews this week.

254
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,420
I have already had an informal interview with them because I was asking them about, you

255
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:06,460
using the theater for that screen, and so I've already talked to him about it. So he

256
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:12,340
knows I know games, and he wants kinda me to focus more on the sales aspect. Like, he's

257
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:16,980
like, well you know, some of the games you might have to sell, you may personally not

258
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:21,340
like. I'm like, no shit. Really? Oh my god, so there's games-

259
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,180
Wait, wait, wait, there's bad video games out there?

260
00:30:23,180 --> 00:30:26,980
No, there's games that I don't like that maybe sell? Really?

261
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:32,020
Like, I don't know, Madden anything? Exactly, I'm like, oh, you know, basically

262
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
So I'm like, yeah, I know that.

263
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,020
Madden fucking sells itself, though.

264
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:38,020
Or anything Xbox, in your case.

265
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:43,020
But after he told me that, you know, it's kind of like he repeated it to reinforce it.

266
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:49,020
And I'm like, yeah, I understand that there's games I'm not gonna like that I have to sell to someone.

267
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,020
That's not a problem.

268
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,020
You know, it's just...

269
00:30:52,020 --> 00:31:00,020
It's like they think that, oh, you know, I'm so, you know, narrow in my perspective on, you know, game sales or something.

270
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:05,540
but whatever I'm I'll probably get it if I do get it it'll be decent money not

271
00:31:05,540 --> 00:31:08,540
gonna say good money because there's no such thing as good money at this company

272
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:14,420
unless you know your manager but better money better money yes that's good I

273
00:31:14,420 --> 00:31:18,260
want to go back to Tekken 5 for a minute because I haven't gotten any hilarious

274
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:23,260
endings the endings I got I've only beat it with Julia cuz I rock with Julia and

275
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:28,860
her ending was kind of like cute I guess it was like oh yeah that's I dropped the

276
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:29,860
the castle.

277
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,860
No, no.

278
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:36,940
Spoiler alert, um, but seriously, if like fighting game storylines are spoilers to you,

279
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:40,620
then, like, you know, fighting game storylines really aren't that much.

280
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:45,100
Like if we were going to tell you that, like, in Final Fantasy VII, Aris dies, then that

281
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:46,520
might be- Oh my god!

282
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,380
I did not see that coming!

283
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,380
Oh my god!

284
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,380
Now that's a spoiler.

285
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:51,380
You just totally spoiled that game.

286
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,380
I did.

287
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:56,420
You have no idea how much I cheered, because I hated that bitch.

288
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:02,860
I have my game saved at the battle, the Jenova battle, right before she dies, so that I can

289
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:08,540
watch it anytime I want to, because my party is so severely overpowered at that point.

290
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:10,460
And I can watch the bitch die over.

291
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:11,860
You should go home and watch it tonight.

292
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Maybe you'll feel a little better.

293
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:18,340
And in Mario, the princess is in another castle.

294
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:20,460
She's always in another fucking castle.

295
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:23,700
You'd think he would ask for directions before rescuing the princess.

296
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:30,500
They have these things on Lake Sang, I think I saw them, or Japan Video Games, one of them.

297
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:36,140
They have, do you know how you get the little boxes that have a secret something in it of

298
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,140
a theme?

299
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,140
Uh huh.

300
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,140
They have bugs in your apartment.

301
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,100
Great, another thing wrong with this place, good thing we're leaving soon.

302
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:48,660
Well I know the government's been watching us, but I wasn't sure about that.

303
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,760
They have Mario scene ones now, and one of them is our princesses in another castle.

304
00:32:54,760 --> 00:33:01,340
And then there's like the fireball one, and there's the coin box one, and all kinds of

305
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,340
stuff.

306
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:03,620
Mario's a great game.

307
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,720
So what are the funny endings in Tekken 5, because I haven't gotten them yet.

308
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,500
I heard Lee was funny.

309
00:33:08,500 --> 00:33:11,180
Kuma and Panda are just hilarious.

310
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:18,420
If you're playing as Panda, Kuma comes up and says, take these flowers, be my wife.

311
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:24,480
I don't know if anyone has ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3 but Blanca's ending is with

312
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,220
Dan and Blanca growl growl growl, oh it's my good friend Dan, well that's what they

313
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:32,940
do with Kuma and Panda, and Roger Jr.

314
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:36,140
Yes, the kangaroo is back.

315
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,980
He was the first character I unlocked, yeah.

316
00:33:37,980 --> 00:33:41,780
Devil Jin is like, whoo, his ending is really evil.

317
00:33:41,780 --> 00:34:02,780
My favorite ending is Asuka's ending, because Jin's laying on the ground, all unconscious, beaten up to death, and she tries to wake him up, and then he jumps up, suddenly awake, and falls on her with his face in her boobs.

318
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:07,780
And she punches him across the screen.

319
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:10,780
It'd be funnier if it was all chibi-fied when they did it.

320
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,780
Because the movies in Tekken 5 are actually really well done.

321
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,780
They're really nice looking and the music's very nice and everything.

322
00:34:15,780 --> 00:34:17,780
The wrong answer speaks Korean.

323
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,780
Yeah.

324
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:20,780
And they didn't all speak English.

325
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,780
They all speak native languages and subtitle.

326
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,780
So I thought that's pretty cool.

327
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:27,780
I did like the thing with Julia and Ganryu.

328
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,780
Because if ever...

329
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:29,780
See, I'm a big Tekken fan.

330
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:33,780
And if ever you follow the story, Ganryu had a thing for her mom.

331
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,780
So, he's going, Julia-chan!

332
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:42,320
she's like what are you talking about when they fight each other yeah it's

333
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:46,080
pretty funny I like that I need to beat it with Anna though cuz Anna's my

334
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:50,520
favorite she's so my favorite ending speed it with Anna first and then beat

335
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,040
it with Nina wasn't there like an old guy in that or something when you're

336
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:57,400
fighting him he's like nice boobs or something yeah there's an old guy that's

337
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,200
I don't remember who's the old guy long jean-rae long jean-rae and when you

338
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:08,480
fight with I think Zayu if you fight yeah if you fight him with her then he

339
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,960
makes that comment. Zayu's ending is of course animated like it was in Tekken 3

340
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:20,000
right I have yet to go back and play Tekken 1 2 3 in it too bad they don't

341
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:24,400
have Gon in this one again I know cuz it was all about playing Tekken force with

342
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:29,800
Gon and of course the Gon ending which is just like reading one of the manga

343
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:31,800
The gomanga is funny.

344
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,600
that I saw. A lot of them were funny. The Paul Phoenix one was funny. He's in his dojo

345
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:11,160
and there's a big sign on there. It says aliens come here to be beaten up or something. Because

346
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,840
he's saying that he's the strongest man in the universe and he can beat up aliens too.

347
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:19,560
So he's all punching through a wall with an alien picture on it, like his old ending with

348
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:24,640
Kuma on it. And then you see the space station, you know there's the space station level.

349
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:32,620
then you see outside all these alien ships coming and his his voice playing

350
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:36,460
over their loudspeakers I think I've seen that one that one was funny and

351
00:36:36,460 --> 00:36:41,820
then the one with martial law where he just gets done paying off all of his

352
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:46,460
debt and then Paul comes up with the bill for his bicycle you know his

353
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:53,100
bicycle is a motorcycle that was funny I love Tekken so much Tekken is pretty

354
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:58,940
cool. I'm very happy with 5. I've always been the Namco fangirl. I know, I know. I'm hoping in the next Tekken,

355
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:02,020
because you know there's gonna be a Tekken 6, I'm hoping that the little

356
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:06,020
prince from Katamari Damacy will cross over into it. That would be great. And

357
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:14,820
roll everybody over. All right. You know there was somebody else though that I

358
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:21,100
thought would be funny and I had it in my head a moment ago and I forgot. Well

359
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,980
if you think of it, just say so. Alright, meanwhile, we're gonna move on to Angel. Angel,

360
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:34,980
how was your week? How was your day? Uh, well, let's see, uh, school on Tuesday and Thursday,

361
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:40,220
and I had posted earlier in the week that I lost my PS2 memory card, and I couldn't

362
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:46,220
find it, and forgot to post that I did find it, so, yay, I can play my games again! Woohoo!

363
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:49,220
uh...

364
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,780
uh... nothing else

365
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:54,700
pretty much except i had to reinstall

366
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:59,340
operating systems yay no just kidding cuz now i have to reinstall

367
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:02,260

368
00:38:02,260 --> 00:38:04,020

369
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,020
do something else for that installing and stuff

370
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:09,380
i hate that update though it's so

371
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:11,660
yuck

372
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,940
uh... other than that all my other games are installed

You know, this is the last one, so... yuck.

374
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:21,820
Other than that, not much.

375
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,340
Hoping to go to a

376
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:27,660
certain convention here in a couple weeks. We'll see.

377
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:30,460
That should be fun. We'll see.

378
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,580
Like I said. Other than that,

379
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:34,400
nothing much.

380
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,380
I'm boring this week.

381
00:38:37,380 --> 00:38:41,180
That's alright. This show kind of has a downer vibe to it tonight.

382
00:38:41,180 --> 00:38:46,100
Oh wait, yeah, well actually there's actually an uppity part of my week in which I forgot.

383
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,900
I started DJing again!

384
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:49,900
You wanna give that a plug?

385
00:38:49,900 --> 00:38:50,900
So you're DJing somewhere else?

I'll be on Pacific time, so if you guys wanna tune in, whatever, you know, I'll be there,

394
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,700
So yeah.

395
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,860
Very cool.

396
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,180
All right, let's see, my week and my day.

397
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:18,900
Like I said, last night I was not here at home

398
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,300
because I went to my old college town, which is a couple

399
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:23,300
hours north of here, Chico, California,

400
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,180
for those who may have heard of it because it's

401
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,140
kind of a legendary party school.

402
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,500
That's where I went to college.

403
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,620
And we went out to like four different bars last night.

404
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:34,160
We just went like, we went fucking bar hopping, OK?

405
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:36,480
We literally like just went from bar to bar.

406
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,040
And I remembered why people go to Chico to party

407
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:42,700
because a little glass of beer that would cost me, like,

408
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:45,120
$4 at one of our bars here.

409
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:48,640
Like, a glass of, what, a pint of Newcastle, OK,

410
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:52,960
cost, like, $4 at a local bar here, $1.50 in Chico.

411
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,360
It's crazy.

412
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:57,080
So very happy about that.

413
00:39:57,080 --> 00:39:59,600
And just, you know, I had good times with some friends

414
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,440
out there and just, you know, danced and drank and stuff

415
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,240
and had crammed, like, 13 people into a Motel 6 room.

416
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,920
Good times.

417
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:12,440
But then I slept, some of us, instead of sleeping in Motel 6, we went to this one girl's house,

418
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:18,840
met this awesome girl up in Chico, she's awesome, she's young, she's just fun, she's great to

419
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,840
be around.

420
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:24,740
And she's got her own apartment and she had us all over there, a few of us, like four

421
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:28,360
of us over there, and I ended up sleeping on the fold-out couch thing.

422
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,720
But the thing is, is that those fold-out couches, I don't know if you've ever slept on one,

423
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:36,800
the couches that fold out into a bed, but the mattresses on them are very weak because,

424
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,040
know it's got a cram back into the couch they're not very strong and they get all

425
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:45,620
bent out of shape and I kind of my body slept like right on the pole kind of

426
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:50,000
thing like into the poles that hold it all together and I woke up this morning

427
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,600
just so sore I don't know like I swear to God I feel like the princess and the

428
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:58,360
pea like you know how in the princess of the pea they the the evil queen or

429
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:01,960
something puts one pea under 20 mattresses and she wakes up she's like

430
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,920
I'm so sore. I feel something on my back all night long. That's me. I was the

431
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:12,840
prince in the pole. That was my story, so that was no fun at all. But okay, I want

432
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:16,360
to tell an interesting story that I thought would be interesting. Something

433
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:23,360
I don't get into political issues very often, but I had to say this. Okay, I was

434
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:26,920
out at one of the bars yesterday, and we were at this place called Joe's, which is

435
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:30,840
a little pub type place. It's kind of got a pub atmosphere, and they've got sawdust

436
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:33,240
all over the floor which I think is really funny because it's like walking

437
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:36,380
into a barn it kind of smells like a barn and my friend says that's to pick

438
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,660
up the vomit really easy which kind of makes sense you know sawdust that's why

439
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:46,320
I think I think that's hilarious so there sawdust all over the ground and we

440
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,320
were walking through the bar to get to the outside area so we could all take a

441
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:55,060
huge table outside and there was this guy who was wearing a frat shirt and it

442
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:59,860
had the big Greek letters on it right is fracture and then underneath it it said

443
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:05,180
against gay frats. And I was just like,

444
00:42:05,180 --> 00:42:08,580
what's your problem?

445
00:42:08,580 --> 00:42:12,660
What do you care if a gay frat starts up?

446
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:16,020
Are you afraid they're going to, you know,

447
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:20,440
come attack you and set your house... Are you afraid that the sorority girls might

448
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:22,980
go to their parties because they'll have more fun

449
00:42:22,980 --> 00:42:27,060
and they won't get raped at those parties? They're talking about gay people. It's not like the

450
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:29,140
Jehovah's Witness or something where they just like,

451
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:31,140
Hello? Hello? Hello?

452
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:33,140
Knocking on your door. You want to convert?

453
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:37,140
Because if you don't, we keep buggering you over and over.

454
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:41,140
Are you afraid the gay fraternity is going to have a prettier house than you?

455
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,140
That smells clean?

456
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:45,140
I stayed at a gay frat house before.

457
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
Yeah?

458
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
It was fun.

459
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:52,140
So I'm assuming that the reason for this is that there must be a gay frat starting in Chico or something.

460
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:56,140
Well, there is a national one that has chapters at schools all over.

461
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,580
must be trying to start one at Chico or something but all the people all the

462
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:04,860
guys up there like we're against gay frats okay are you worried they're gonna

463
00:43:04,860 --> 00:43:09,660
be competition in sports or something cuz they won't this is just so like the

464
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,660
80s you know where it was the revenge of the nerds now it's revenge of the gays

465
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:17,740
it's seriously you know jocks have always been against one you know

466
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:25,340
minority of people you know whether it be you know nerds or I don't know gays

467
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:31,180
or like you know even going further back blacks I mean it's just you know that's

468
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:34,820
what frats do it's like they get drunk they're like okay now we have to be a

469
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,460
you know an activist at something we have to make ourselves feel better by

470
00:43:38,460 --> 00:43:42,980
making fun of somebody a group of people so that we can feel more masculine and

471
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:49,980
That way we can, you know, dignify ourselves for being stupid and not getting anywhere in life.

472
00:43:49,980 --> 00:43:50,980
Yeah.

473
00:43:50,980 --> 00:43:56,980
Okay, another story, there was a fraternity up there in Chico, you might have heard this in the news,

474
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,980
but they made some guy as part of, like, a hazing ritual swallow, like, five gallons of water,

475
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:06,980
and the guy fucking drowned from drinking so much water, like, they forced him to drink all this water.

476
00:44:06,980 --> 00:44:08,980
He fucking died from it, right?

477
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:13,180
That would never happen in a gay fraternity. The only thing you get drown in is love

478
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,300
It's just I

479
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:24,140
Don't know. I just I as somebody who's gay as you may have heard. I don't know

480
00:44:24,140 --> 00:44:26,860
I just felt like I was kind of offended by it

481
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:30,420
Not that I'm interested in joining a fraternity and I could care less about fraternities

482
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:36,780
But I'm just kind of like why does it concern you so much if this person over here in this house wants to have a bunch

483
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:42,460
gay people over and have fun and start a, you know, gay fraternity. It's not like one

484
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:50,120
big orgy, it's just guys who are gay and, you know, who cares? They're very, from what

485
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,420
I understand, they're actually pretty similar to straight fraternities just without all

486
00:44:53,420 --> 00:44:59,400
the, you know, bullshit. So, but I think what was really funny is we all went back there

487
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,720
and we just started bitching and we were talking about what an idiot the guy must be, like

488
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:08,120
like 13 of us. Girls and guys, straight, gay, everything. Just an eclectic group of people,

489
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:11,560
right? Just sitting around like how stupid this guy was. In fact, I called this one girl

490
00:45:11,560 --> 00:45:14,800
the ringleader of Algada because she was talking about how, you know, she wanted to go like

491
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:22,480
firebomb their house and stuff. And I think what happened is that the guy sitting at the

492
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:27,220
table across from us was in that same fraternity because I saw the two of them talking later

493
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:30,800
on in the evening and like they looked at us weird when we left. And I was just kind

494
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,000
like, eh, whatever. That's what you get. So anyway, that was my little rant.

495
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:41,120
You know what? Hating is stupid. I hate people that hate.

496
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:44,960
I hate them too. I have no tolerance for intolerance.

497
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:51,760
Yeah, damn them. We need to ostracize them from our society.

498
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:56,880
We should not allow them to get married. Yeah. They need to be neutered.

499
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,420
Because that just encourages reproduction.

500
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:05,060
I really do think that there needs to be a breeding test.

501
00:46:05,060 --> 00:46:10,380
A standardized test for parents, you know, for potential parents.

502
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:11,380
And if you fail...

503
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:12,380
Tide!

504
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:18,540
Yeah, which one of these, okay, which one of these would not make a good bed for your

505
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,540
baby?

506
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,540
A. Crib.

507
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:21,540
B. Um...

508
00:46:21,540 --> 00:46:22,540
Baffinette.

509
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:23,540
I don't know.

510
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,540
Baffinette.

511
00:46:24,540 --> 00:46:28,740
I don't know bassinet see Tupperware container

512
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:38,340
Seriously have you ever seen the back of one of those Tupperware storage things like the huge ones that you're supposed to put your clothes

513
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:41,940
In you look at the back, and it has a little not because I've seen it

514
00:46:41,940 --> 00:46:42,340
Yes

515
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:47,220
And it has a little do-nots in the back and one of them has a do-not and it has a little picture of a baby

516
00:46:47,220 --> 00:46:49,220
in the Tupperware container

517
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:54,220
Who in the hell is stupid enough to, and you know they only put that on there because somebody did it.

518
00:46:54,220 --> 00:47:00,220
If you're putting your baby in a Tupperware container, and even worse, okay,

519
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:06,220
maybe I can see somebody like putting a baby in a Tupperware container just for a little bit so they don't get into things,

520
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:08,220
but putting the lid on it?

521
00:47:08,220 --> 00:47:13,220
Dude, this is all the Japanese fault, and I can tell you why, okay? I'm gonna get into this.

522
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:17,880
saw a video last night now don't ask me why I'm browsing strange fetish videos

523
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:21,920
for Japanese whatever it's on that super zooey because you got all the weird shit

524
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:27,600
on there anyways they have a fetish thing where they actually vacuum seal

525
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:34,200
people inside those storage bags women and they just leave them there like as

526
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:40,200
they suck all the air out and I'm like that's weird but it's people like that

527
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:46,200
that's why they have to put these things on here. Don't vacuum seal your kids. That will not keep them fresh.

528
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:55,200
I just, I don't know. I weep for the future. I really do.

529
00:47:56,200 --> 00:48:03,200
Anyway, what else did I do this week? I've been taking a hiatus from Final Fantasy XI this week. I'm on vacation from Vanadil.

530
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:08,200
So I've been playing other games, like Final Fantasy II. I've been going back and playing that.

531
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:11,700
Well, I'm actually doing pretty well at Final Fantasy II, and it's actually a pretty neat game.

532
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:13,700
It's all about Final Fantasy III.

533
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:16,200
Which is the one game they need to release here, dammit.

534
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:17,700
And they're supposed to do it on the DS later.

535
00:48:17,700 --> 00:48:19,700
Final Fantasy III was the job change game.

536
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,200
Yeah, that was the first job change.

537
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:21,700
I did not-

538
00:48:21,700 --> 00:48:23,200
And it was pretty cool.

539
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,200
However, I did not realize that Chocobo was actually first appeared in Final Fantasy II.

540
00:48:27,200 --> 00:48:29,700
I thought they did not make an appearance until III.

541
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:30,700
Nope, it was II.

542
00:48:30,700 --> 00:48:34,700
And by the way, we're talking Japanese numbers here, not the Americanized II and III.

543
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:37,700
I still think that Final Fantasy V was the best of all of them.

544
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:42,040
It's it's okay. My favorite is still for because it's all about but

545
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,220
sorry, I

546
00:48:46,300 --> 00:48:48,300
Love how

547
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:55,580
Some names are cuz they didn't in Japanese it would be like Batsu like that

548
00:48:57,020 --> 00:49:01,100
but if you try to romanize it it would be but and

549
00:49:01,100 --> 00:49:09,100
And the copy that I had that was translated, I had it done, because I first tried to play it in Japanese, and I got decently through it.

550
00:49:09,100 --> 00:49:11,100
The second one I had that was translated ROM.

551
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:18,100
Yeah, there was that huge, like it was, this was, because Final Fantasy V was like the first fully translated Japanese ROM that hit the internet.

552
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:23,100
It was huge. I even played that. I remember that. That's when I first really played Final Fantasy V.

553
00:49:23,100 --> 00:49:30,100
And I understood why they didn't release it in the United States, because it was too complicated for the audience at the time, I think.

554
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:34,740
I think dumb Americans basically I mean what step up but now oh no big deal now

555
00:49:35,260 --> 00:49:40,320
But I also the nosh actually the big ROM to me the one that caused the biggest sir

556
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:43,360
Was when they did Seiken Densetsu 3?

557
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:46,860
Which was the one after Secret of Mana over here?

558
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:52,460
That was that was huge too because the first Seiken Densetsu was brought in the u.s. Is the final fantasy adventure, right?

559
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:57,540
But that was and they had gone so far as to translate the graphics

560
00:49:57,540 --> 00:50:00,040
like street signs and things.

561
00:50:00,040 --> 00:50:04,020
That's cool. You know what though, I gotta be honest, Second Dense to a Three is

562
00:50:04,020 --> 00:50:07,520
one that I didn't really get into. I was probably more into,

563
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,540
sad enough, I was more into Secret of Evermore

564
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,280
probably that I was into that. I was just happy to find a ROM of

565
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:18,740
panorama cotton, which, for anyone who is a big

566
00:50:18,740 --> 00:50:22,260
video game nerd like me, panorama cotton, they only made like

567
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,120
600 copies of. And I actually have a friend who owns one.

568
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:34,120
And I have actually the one after that on Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton.

569
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:39,120
The normal cotton games are about the little witch that throws up whenever she eats this one candy.

570
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:41,120
The wheel-o candy.

571
00:50:41,120 --> 00:50:43,120
And they're normally a side-scrolling game.

572
00:50:43,120 --> 00:50:46,120
It came out on Neo Geo Pocket, it came out on Super Nintendo back when.

573
00:50:46,120 --> 00:50:50,120
PC Engine, which I have the one on PC Engine Duo.

574
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:59,720
duo. But this one was a behind the character one, sort of a third-person perspective, and

575
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:03,240
you were flying the whole time. It was pretty cool. But this was all done sort of... I know

576
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,960
Mode 7 was the Super Nintendo thing, but it reminded me a lot of that.

577
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:07,960
Heck yeah.

578
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:12,520
But it was really awesome. And they made like 600 copies of it and someone finally did a

579
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:19,520
a ROM of it.

580
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:26,600
I think one of these days I'm going to bring over the Dreamcast and Rainbow Cotton.

581
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:30,960
I want to see this, and you know, you've kind of been doing that lately where you're bringing

582
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,620
over games and just kind of making us look at them.

583
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:39,980
I could bring over Super Producers, it's basically like the precursor to the American Idol video

584
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,320
games, where you go pick out your little idol dresser up and teach her how to dance, although

585
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:46,320
I need an FAQ.

586
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,320
Do you have the music factory create your own video game?

587
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:51,200
No, I have the Marky Mark one.

588
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,000
Loki was asking, do you have the CNC music factory create your own music video game?

589
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:57,680
It's either the Marky Mark one I have or the Crisscross one.

590
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:01,200
I think I have the Crisscross one, actually.

591
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:07,080
And I have the CD plus G disc that has the Information Society songs on it.

592
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:11,580
Our chat room is complaining that we are depressing them tonight with our, like, just kind of

593
00:52:11,580 --> 00:52:13,560
subdued chat tonight.

594
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,920
I apologize we can't be peppy every night.

595
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,880
Well, if I tried to be more energetic, I would cough a lung cookie all over the microphone

596
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:20,880
and it would be disgusting.

597
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:21,880
Yes.

598
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,880
Because microphones are not cheap.

599
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:24,880
Bring me food.

600
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:25,880
That's right.

601
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:29,800
I need a hot burrito.

602
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:30,800
All right.

603
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:36,880
That's crisscross with a K, not a C. I miss the bus.

604
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:43,320
Jamie may be sick, but she's not too sick to correct you if you, uh, get some...

605
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:47,240
Alright, uh, what we're gonna do, we're gonna go to a break. We're gonna come back from break. We're gonna talk about some

606
00:52:47,240 --> 00:52:48,880
Bamani news going on this week.

607
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,820
And we're gonna start it off with an I Told You So!

608
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:55,640
Because there is a huge I Told You So! from Sunday, and this news is all over

609
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:58,200
the web. I'm sure you guys have heard this already, but

611
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:01,160
last week.

612
00:53:01,160 --> 00:53:04,240
We sure did, but what did we tell them?

So Guitar Freak Strawmania V started off with a little bit of poo, we'll be back after this.

621
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:12,280
Don't you like the taste of gold?

622
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:14,280
The best

623
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:19,280
Self is the taste of my mouth

624
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:22,280
With a big smile

625
00:54:22,280 --> 00:54:25,280
Please don't you

For them

629

We must be fast, we must be free We must be fast, we must be free

630

I only go down and come along

631
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,280
Take a round, and stretch it out

632
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Run away, and get out of bed

633
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,280
I'm small, and you can't do nothing

634
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,280
I do it, I do it, I do it, I'm a mom

635
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,280
I'm a rock, I'm a rock, I'm a star

636
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,280
I'm a woman, I'm a star, yeah

637
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:47,280
So now that you're getting older, you've grown and I've got something to tell you

638
00:59:47,280 --> 00:59:51,280
I'm talking to you now for what you've done

639
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,280
I know that you're gonna be this strong enough

640
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,280
You know I'm proud of you

641
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:04,280
You've got to finish what you've begun

642
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,280
But your new world is waiting for you

643
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:13,280
I know you can do it

644
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:18,280
Whatever you want, you will find a way

645
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,280
Cause living will be a mess till you can't believe it

646
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:30,280
I will be here now until this future needs it

647
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,280
Help us to see now, help us to see

648
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:36,280
But we can, we are gonna be free, yeah

649
01:00:36,280 --> 01:00:38,280
We can't believe it

650
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:43,280
Under your fire we'll wake up, you're on fire

651
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,280
You'll be a man, yeah, yeah

652
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,280
You'll be a man, you'll be a man

653
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:08,320
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

654
01:01:08,320 --> 01:01:09,320
No!

655
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:11,480
Just kidding.

656
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,680
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

657
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:23,440
With the exception of that last segment there, according to some of our listeners, bitches!

658
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,280
They don't like hearing about our weeks or days anymore, I don't think.

659
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:32,640
screw them you know we listen to their week no actually we don't do it but we

660
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:36,480
would we read a lot of their live journals and they we read whatever they

661
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:39,280
post in the orange lounge community although not a lot of people post there

662
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:43,920
but when they do we read it and you know you know that starting this week we

663
01:01:43,920 --> 01:01:49,200
actually have the rice princess who you might know from outside the box she has

664
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:54,660
started the one up calm orange launch radio club does that mean I have to sign

665
01:01:54,660 --> 01:02:24,640
up for that thing? If you want. I mean, you don't have to, but it's another... Ever since the... I've been kind of scared of those other sites now. Yeah, 1up.com is kind of cool. I like what they're doing. It's different. As far as the gaming sites go, I like it. You know, I give it a thumbs up. There are some things I think would make it better, but considering that the blogging aspects and the community aspect was not really what the site was built around, it was supposed to be like a game spot style site.

666
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,760
basically to complement the magazines that Ziff Davis puts out,

667
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:30,720
Electronic Gaming Monthly and stuff,

668
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,920
considering that that stuff was kind of more of an afterthought or

669
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:37,400
secondary, it's not that bad. But, you know,

670
01:02:37,400 --> 01:02:41,560
it could benefit from better friends pages, things like that, you know.

671
01:02:41,560 --> 01:02:45,160
But it's a neat site. I recommend it. Check it out. 1UP.com.

672
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:49,000
We will post the link

673
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,840
to the new Orange Laundrio Club. For those you guys that are

674
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:56,160
already on 1UP.com. We're not telling you you have to go sign up for it or any of that

675
01:02:56,160 --> 01:03:00,840
stuff. You know, just if you want to join the club, it's there. And RicePrincess has

676
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:05,440
taken it upon herself to post pictures in the club and some other little things. So

677
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:09,360
the cool thing about the 1UP club that none of the other stuff we have really offers is

678
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:14,080
that, you know, since RicePrincess works with us quite a bit, she has a lot of pictures

679
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:18,560
from the inside, quote unquote, and like old logos and marketing things and things like

680
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:26,040
So she's adding a lot of that to the community. So check it out. It's it's orange lounge radio dash club dot one up dot com

681
01:03:26,080 --> 01:03:28,640
But we'll put that link in the chat room for those of you guys who might have missed it

682
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:36,360
Anyway, I said that we were gonna talk about some news starting this off here including a little bit of told you so

683
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:38,640
last week

684
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:42,600
This was the news that came around last week the news that came out last week

685
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:47,000
We were talking about was that red octane announced that they were going to be

686
01:03:47,000 --> 01:03:52,120
publishing a game. They didn't say that they were going to be writing a game, although

687
01:03:52,120 --> 01:03:54,980
some people kind of jumped to that conclusion, but they said they were going to start publishing

688
01:03:54,980 --> 01:04:01,340
games for PlayStation 2. And what did we say? We said, gee, it would be a great outlet for

689
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:04,800
In the Groove, wouldn't it? Wouldn't surprise me at all to see In the Groove be the game

690
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:11,140
that's published by these guys. Sure enough, not even two hours after the show's over,

691
01:04:11,140 --> 01:04:17,140
It leaks to the internet. Some no-name fitness gaming site posts this article

692
01:04:17,140 --> 01:04:23,220
that confirms that Red Octane donated copies of In The Groove for PlayStation 2

693
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:27,260
to this local school for their fitness program, and it was just a wildfire from there.

694
01:04:27,260 --> 01:04:29,260
DDR Freak picked it up. We picked it up.

695
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:32,580
It ran everywhere. So now everybody knows, and Red Octane finally made the official

696
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,440
announcement,

697
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:38,400
the game they are publishing is in fact In The Groove.

698
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,960
If you could see me roll my eyes.

699
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:45,160
But I don't get on the webcam.

700
01:04:45,160 --> 01:04:49,480
It's interesting news nonetheless. I'll go cough up a lung cookie in its honor.

701
01:04:49,480 --> 01:04:52,360
It's interesting news nonetheless. No, actually, what's interesting, and I didn't

702
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,360
get to this

703
01:04:53,360 --> 01:04:55,640
in How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because I knew I would

704
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:58,080
want to come back and talk about this later, but I actually

705
01:04:58,080 --> 01:05:01,640
decided, because we have an in-the-groove machine here in Sacramento now,

706
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,120
where Orange Launch Radio is based,

707
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:07,000
I decided I was going to go play it this week. So I did. I went Wednesday night, I added the arcade

708
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:11,920
all to myself, so it was awesome, and I played In The Groove again, and I still, you know,

709
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:16,340
to give it a fair chance, I wanted to see, do I warm up to it a little more, do I, eh,

710
01:05:16,340 --> 01:05:20,880
maybe go, what was I thinking the first time? I still feel the same way, my opinion hasn't

711
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:25,120
changed. I don't dislike In The Groove, so please don't talk about how much Sky on Earth

712
01:05:25,120 --> 01:05:30,880
was ready to dogs In The Groove, cause I don't dislike the game. But I don't think it's God's

713
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,440
greatest gift to dance games, either.

714
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:34,600
Good.

715
01:05:34,600 --> 01:05:38,960
For me to poop on!

716
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:39,960
For me, it's Middleground.

717
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:42,480
There's things I like about it and there's things I don't like about it.

718
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:46,160
To recap, what I don't like about it, it's fugly.

719
01:05:46,160 --> 01:05:48,300
I don't like the game because it's fugly.

720
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:50,080
I don't care for the interface.

721
01:05:50,080 --> 01:05:51,640
I don't care for the way the game looks in-game.

722
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:52,840
I don't like the way the arrows scroll.

723
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,480
Yes, I know you can change it.

724
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,040
But even when you change it, it's still fugly.

725
01:05:56,040 --> 01:05:58,600
I don't like the way the arrows look, I don't like the way the backgrounds looks, I don't

726
01:05:58,600 --> 01:05:59,880
like the look.

727
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,060
So sorry, but I think it's fugly.

728
01:06:02,060 --> 01:06:06,060
And a lot of the things that draw people to DDR is the fact that it's chibi and it's cute

729
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,380
and it flashes and it's seizure-ismic.

730
01:06:09,380 --> 01:06:12,060
In the Groove is missing that completely.

731
01:06:12,060 --> 01:06:15,100
What I like about In the Groove, I like the minds.

732
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:18,380
They make a lot of the songs pretty cool.

733
01:06:18,380 --> 01:06:22,780
I like, for the most part, I can't say the step charts are bad.

734
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:26,500
I think they're different, they're neat, they're fun.

735
01:06:26,500 --> 01:06:30,580
not very freestyle-able on the easier levels, but they're, you know, I guess fun on the

736
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:34,140
hard levels. But then we get back into what I don't like about it. What I don't like about

737
01:06:34,140 --> 01:06:40,680
it is that it's just, you know, an orgy of all these uber difficult songs that are for

738
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:50,820
a very select elite few DDR players to be playing. And I just, I don't know. I don't...

739
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:57,260
I think it would have difficulty getting into the masses when this is kind of its big thing

740
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:00,680
is that, hey, it's a game that's harder than DDR, but of course they're going back and

741
01:07:00,680 --> 01:07:03,980
fixing some of this because when they announce that they're doing this on the PS2, they announce

742
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:08,400
they're gonna do an all novice level and that, you know, their sequels are gonna have novice

743
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:13,100
levels, so fine, they're changing some of that, but regardless, it's not there now.

744
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,040
So anyway, you know, just kind of long story short, things I like, things I don't like,

745
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,780
and the song list I'm very meh on, like there's some songs I really, really, really like,

746
01:07:20,780 --> 01:07:25,120
really, really like, there's some songs that are just very, they're filler, there's absolute

747
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:30,420
filler songs. So, that's my take on In The Groove. So when I kind of heard this was coming

748
01:07:30,420 --> 01:07:34,100
out for PlayStation 2, I was, I've kind of felt very the same way, I felt very borderline.

749
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,820
I was just kind of like, well, you know, I'm not surprised, but at the same time, what's

750
01:07:38,820 --> 01:07:45,800
very interesting about this is that now they're invading Konami's turf, which I think is very

751
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:50,240
interesting because we all kind of know that Konami has basically turned its

752
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:55,820
back on DDR in the arcades in the u.s. there isn't supposed to be DDR in the

753
01:07:55,820 --> 01:08:00,380
arcades in the u.s. save one crappy mix that's five six years old at this point

754
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:05,400
oh I'm sorry two crappy mixes I keep forgetting about 1.5 1.5 in USA so save

755
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:10,060
two crappy mixes that are god-awful years old now

756
01:08:10,060 --> 01:08:15,540
Konami's turned his back on DDR on the USA but they've been making all their

757
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:18,460
money off these home releases and that's what they're really whoring up now so

758
01:08:18,460 --> 01:08:22,460
now in the grooves coming in and they're gonna start invading on that turf a

759
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:29,520
little bit how so as in the arcades for in the groove yes it's just from what

760
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:32,900
we were understanding and we have not heard much to the contrary yeah but it's

761
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:37,300
gonna be just a freaking port of the arcade version with additions novice

762
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:40,900
level for new songs things like that so it's gonna be the arcade version of in

763
01:08:40,900 --> 01:08:46,740
groove and then some so kind of neat I guess but now they're coming on to

764
01:08:46,740 --> 01:08:51,140
Konami's turf so of course there's that big talk out there oh Konami's gonna sue

765
01:08:51,140 --> 01:08:55,020
them they're gonna sue and they're gonna make it depends I just I don't see it

766
01:08:55,020 --> 01:08:57,100
happening at this point I think if they were gonna sue they would have done it

767
01:08:57,100 --> 01:09:01,140
by now I'm really thinking that there's something going on I mean now the rock

768
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,540
star people need a group people have been saying this for a long time we've

769
01:09:03,540 --> 01:09:07,420
got our ass covered on this don't worry but we all been kind of sitting there

770
01:09:07,420 --> 01:09:09,940
going well they probably just have a loophole you know it's kind of the

771
01:09:09,940 --> 01:09:12,860
assumptions that they're probably sitting on some kind of loophole that

772
01:09:12,860 --> 01:09:16,220
you know they might get their shit called on eventually but it's more time

773
01:09:16,220 --> 01:09:24,820
goes on here and that's the other thing is it now the pump it up release just

774
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:29,380
totally got overshadowed amongst all this news but we've got in the groove

775
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:32,700
coming out pump it up coming out which you know was also kind of an invasion of

776
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:36,460
Konami's turf if you think about it but but pump it up is different because it's

777
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:41,140
you're gonna have to buy a whole new dance pad for that game so it's it's

778
01:09:41,140 --> 01:09:45,820
gonna be a crippled release as it is getting the Korean import that's we have

779
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:56,900
to get the converter for the PC pad and all that crap I'm just I'm kind of

780
01:09:56,900 --> 01:10:00,780
reading some of the feedback on a chat room if you have some feedback www.orange

781
01:10:00,780 --> 01:10:04,620
launch radio.com click on chat and you can give us some feedback here in the

782
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:13,000
chat room. Let's just kind of look in here. Dr. Tsuya says, if Konami wants to compete

783
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:17,380
within the groove and pump it up on home consoles, they're going to have to pull out all the

784
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:23,880
stops. Well, what I think is interesting about that is my assumption was always, Konami could

785
01:10:23,880 --> 01:10:30,900
pull out one big stop in the form of a lawsuit. But, obviously, they're not sitting on a loophole,

786
01:10:30,900 --> 01:10:34,620
the rocks over there's something there that is because if Konami was gonna sue

787
01:10:34,620 --> 01:10:40,020
it would have happened by now granted maybe something could happen in the next

788
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:44,700
couple weeks as Konami could be like this announcement of in the groove

789
01:10:44,700 --> 01:10:48,660
coming out really lit the fire under their ass so now the lawyers are out but

790
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:52,980
I just somehow highly doubt it at this point it's kind of like Konami's just

791
01:10:52,980 --> 01:10:57,180
writing it off which kind of irritates me in a way I'm having a check on

792
01:10:57,180 --> 01:11:03,820
something, by the way. Oh, okay. Looking at intellectual property and business law. Right.

793
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:09,880
Well, you know, we could argue this till we're blue in the face, if there's grounds for a

794
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:14,860
lawsuit or not. But there's two key elements missing. A, we don't know if Rockstar has

795
01:11:14,860 --> 01:11:19,540
any secret agreements. For all we know, they're slipping Konami a percentage of the profits

796
01:11:19,540 --> 01:11:26,000
to do this. That could very well be a possibility that we're just not aware of. It's doubtful,

797
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:31,900
But it's a possibility you have to admit. It's a possibility is Loki's in the kitchen. They're going no no no it's doubtful, but it's possibility

798
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:38,960
Okay here comes Loki Loki's got something he wants to say on this

799
01:11:43,680 --> 01:11:46,240
Come here he comes doo doo doo doo, okay?

800
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:50,960
Here's what's actually going on here first off the whole reason is

801
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:55,820
in the groove was basically step mania of course changed enough to where it

802
01:11:55,820 --> 01:12:01,040
wouldn't violate the copyrights that they had on Konami had on dance games

803
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:05,840
so that would include the angle of the arrows coming up the arrow graphic

804
01:12:05,840 --> 01:12:13,940
design the interface etc okay now hardware wise the thing that they were

805
01:12:13,940 --> 01:12:19,400
worried about as far as violating that well guess who has the rights to the

806
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:23,960
hardware. That'd be EndoMiro. Guess who's making the hardware for EndoGroup 2? EndoMiro.

807
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:27,200
Yeah, but you're talking EndoGroup 2. I'm not talking about EndoGroup 2 yet. We haven't

808
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:30,840
brought that up. Well, I'm talking about EndoGroup 1. Okay? Basically saying that the rights

809
01:12:30,840 --> 01:12:36,440
are all taken care of and that kind of stuff. As far as being able to compute DDR, sure,

810
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:40,160
people will buy it. It's not going to do well, though. It's going to fail. It's going to

811
01:12:40,160 --> 01:12:47,800
fall hard. Here's why. 13-footers on an ignition pad. It's not going to happen. Handplants

812
01:12:47,800 --> 01:13:00,800
It's not gonna happen. You know, it's just, that game was designed for the arcade and the fact that difficulty level is up there, you're not gonna be able to utilize that part of the game on homepads, on ordinary homepads. It's crazy.

813
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:10,800
And, you know, to even get into In the Groove 2 a little bit, it, um, 13 footer doubles, that's ridiculous. It's just stupid.

814
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,800
I, um, I, okay, go ahead, finish your thought, and then we'll get to Jamie.

815
01:13:14,800 --> 01:13:28,800
But then again, you have Pump It Up, where you have, you know, handplants and stuff on that, so apparently someone likes it, and that's doing well enough, and whether that's going to translate well enough into, you know, the home version, that's, I don't know.

816
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:52,800
I don't know, but I personally think hand plants and that kind of stuff, that's not going to work well in Helm version, you're just going to get another pretty much, you know, rip off of DDR because you're going to have the new diet version which is in there. It's basically all the modes DDR has, you know, thrown in there and renamed something different.

817
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:57,800
Alright, I have a response to this because I feel differently, but I want to let Jamie intervene.

818
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:01,040
looking, I found the information I was looking for for trademark law.

819
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:04,680
I'm just going to read this one paragraph because this will basically clear it up.

820
01:14:04,680 --> 01:14:08,080
A trademark functions as a guarantee of the consistent level

821
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:12,400
of certain characteristics such as quality so that the public when making a purchase

822
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:15,680
will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.

823
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:18,800
So basically, it's trademark infringement.

824
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,480
I mean, purely, because

825
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:26,760
In the Groove has basically everything

826
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:30,880
that DDR is known for. It's in, you know, it'd be like

827
01:14:30,880 --> 01:14:35,440
me putting out this special glass that's supposed to

828
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:39,480
stay cold, like, forever, and then having another company put out exactly the same

829
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,880
glass but blue, you know.

830
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:45,440
What about the, okay, what about this argument, because this is a classic argument that people

831
01:14:45,440 --> 01:14:48,640
people say about this, and, you know, you have to, we have to pay this respect.

832
01:14:48,640 --> 01:14:53,640
What's the difference between this being one dance game to another dance game than, say,

833
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:58,160
Tekken was a 3D fighter and Virtua Fighter was a 3D fighter

834
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:02,240
and they were very similar in that aspect.

835
01:15:02,240 --> 01:15:04,880
If you play them, they are completely different.

836
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:07,800
First different, yeah, different engine. That's just like saying what's the difference

837
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,440
between Street Fighter and

838
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:13,160
say, um, Guilty Gear.

839
01:15:13,160 --> 01:15:16,720
In the Groove is supposed to play just like DDR basically, right?

840
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:19,960
Well the thing that always weirded me out about In the Groove

841
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:23,440
is that it was specifically made for DDR cabinets.

842
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:26,840
that will always kinda sat weird with me. Now granted,

843
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:30,560
I realize this is all changing with In The Groove, but again, In The Groove 2,

844
01:15:30,560 --> 01:15:34,400
we haven't gone there yet. I'm still talking about In The Groove 1. And you know what's

845
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:34,900
funny?

846
01:15:34,900 --> 01:15:37,920
What? And I have to laugh because it's coming.

847
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:41,160
You don't think that they're gonna stop, you know,

848
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,920
they're basically taking everything Konami has stopped supporting, and they're supporting it

849
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:45,400
further.

850
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:49,000
You watch, and I guarantee you,

851
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,840
probably by the end of this year, you're gonna see five key versions of something like In The

852
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,440
groove that's going to be supporting for all those old BeatMania cabinets that no longer

853
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:00,960
can get upgrades because BeatMania the final came out and that was it. You're going to

854
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:05,280
have a new five key game that's going to be coming out and I don't know about Dance Maniacs

855
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,800
but Dance Maniacs could be another step too.

856
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,800
Interesting thought. Jamie?

857
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:14,920
There's a little bit more on this one. Basically, trademarks are considered property and protected

858
01:16:14,920 --> 01:16:20,800
as property. Trademark infringement should be prevented as a type of unfair competition.

859
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,520
further trademark infringement violates the standards of commercial morality. Additionally,

860
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,960
trademarks require protection as they represent an investment in goodwill. With law behind

861
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,460
protecting the interests of the trademark owners, infringers are prevented from free

862
01:16:34,460 --> 01:16:40,440
riding on the efforts of others. That's what I wanted to point out. I mean, again, this

863
01:16:40,440 --> 01:16:45,540
in the groove thing is basically riding on the coattails of Konami for DDR. There's another

864
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:53,540
There's another one on here too. Infringement of trademark falls below the minimum level of fair competition the government enforces in marketplace.

865
01:16:53,540 --> 01:17:00,540
Infringement of trademarks is but an aspect of unfair competition. Since unfair competition is a tort, trademark infringement is a tort as well.

866
01:17:00,540 --> 01:17:05,540
And for those of you who don't know, tort is a wrong. A law break, basically.

867
01:17:05,540 --> 01:17:08,540
If you're doing something, you're not supposed to.

868
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:15,380
Now, but the thing is, despite whether the law may or may not be in Konami's sphere, because again, there could be a secret agreement we don't know about.

869
01:17:15,380 --> 01:17:16,380
Could be.

870
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:28,540
Um, even if, if there was some, like, legal thing that has, uh, you know, that says Konami's in the right with this or whatever, if Konami just doesn't do anything about it, this, we're talking till we're blue in the face here, right?

871
01:17:28,540 --> 01:17:33,540
Well, it's up to Konami if they want to pursue it, but regardless, you know...

872
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:36,100
Okay, here's my perspective though.

873
01:17:36,100 --> 01:17:39,400
Loki says In the Groove doesn't think it's going to do well at home.

874
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:40,400
I disagree.

875
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:43,940
I think In the Groove stands to do very well in the home market, and there's one reason

876
01:17:43,940 --> 01:17:44,940
why.

877
01:17:44,940 --> 01:17:45,940
Price?

878
01:17:45,940 --> 01:17:47,620
Okay, I guess you're right.

879
01:17:47,620 --> 01:17:48,620
There's a couple reasons why.

880
01:17:48,620 --> 01:17:53,420
A, if the price is right, we don't know what the price is yet, but imagine if In the Groove

881
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,980
goes for 20 bucks.

882
01:17:55,980 --> 01:18:03,060
That's going to be a big, you put the $20 game next to the $30, $40 DDR game, that's

883
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:08,360
gonna be, you know, quite a bit, quite a toughie to go up against there. And sadly, people

884
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:12,500
are fooled by cheap knockoffs. Exactly, but here's the other thing, and that's the reason

885
01:18:12,500 --> 01:18:19,620
why the Mad Catz GameCube game, that's why that failed, because the price was wrong on

886
01:18:19,620 --> 01:18:22,340
that, and you had to have a special pad for it, there was no way they were gonna make

887
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:25,740
that cheap. Well, I'm talking about their dance pads, and all the third party pads that

888
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:32,380
were so crappy. Well, you bring me to my other point, though. Red Octane has a lock on the

889
01:18:32,380 --> 01:18:38,100
home market for dance pads. They really do. Most people that are into dance games know

890
01:18:38,100 --> 01:18:44,180
that Red Octane produces the best home pads. And stores like GameStop, EB Games, Fry's,

891
01:18:44,180 --> 01:18:51,180
whatever, carry tons of the Red Octane pads. Remember Fulton and Marconi? Yes. And remember,

892
01:18:52,460 --> 01:18:56,700
but remember this, Red Octane is now the one that's going to be putting out in the groove.

893
01:18:56,700 --> 01:19:02,460
So what's going to stop them from putting on every box of these dance pads, you know,

894
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,540
for use with games such as In the Groove.

895
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,380
Buy In the Groove in stores now.

896
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,940
In the Groove this, In the Groove that.

897
01:19:09,940 --> 01:19:15,900
It's going to be this automatic partnership between the biggest selling dance pad and

898
01:19:15,900 --> 01:19:16,900
now this new game.

899
01:19:16,900 --> 01:19:21,080
I think the only way we're going to get somewhat of a straight answer is to start looking for

900
01:19:21,080 --> 01:19:25,460
a press release from Konami or start contacting their reps.

901
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:33,240
Well now you remember we had the lost interview with Jason Enos that we did at E3 last year

902
01:19:33,240 --> 01:19:37,020
and we didn't end up getting to play it on the station because things happened and it

903
01:19:37,020 --> 01:19:40,500
didn't end up getting saved.

904
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:45,020
But Loki actually dropped the bomb and he asked straight up, he said, what do you think

905
01:19:45,020 --> 01:19:46,960
of In the Groove?

906
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,960
And the answer we got was kind of, it was very politically correct middle ground, kind

907
01:19:51,960 --> 01:19:57,400
of you know kind of welcoming the competition but not gonna acknowledge it

908
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,680
type thing I don't know how to say I don't want to misquote him so I'm not

909
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:04,800
gonna try and say he said this but I do remember that the answer we got was very

910
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:11,400
I'm not gonna it was very on the fence what was like I can't believe it and I

911
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,640
remember I I will never forget that look that he gave Loki after Loki asked that

912
01:20:15,640 --> 01:20:21,720
as he kind of was like it was that oh fuck I knew this was coming look

913
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:27,720
God, I wish we had that. Oh, I'm so mad that that didn't end up happening.

914
01:20:27,720 --> 01:20:35,720
Don't you find it a little funny that it being a couple months away from E3, we haven't heard anything about a new DDR game yet?

915
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:44,720
Because I firmly believe they are gonna throw out the punches at E3. I think E3, they will announce all of them.

916
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:52,720
I firmly believe there will be another one for Xbox and another one for PlayStation and I think they're going to do DDR Mario here in the U.S.

917
01:20:52,720 --> 01:20:55,720
I think they're going to be rolling out new dance games on all three platforms.

918
01:20:55,720 --> 01:21:05,720
And a certain website of a certain artist that we interviewed said that he might have an involvement with it, but of course he can't say anything other than that.

919
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:08,720
Interesting. I didn't know about that.

920
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:20,720
I posted the link to the trademark infringement site in the chat room for anybody who is at all interested in knowing the legal background behind it.

921
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:23,720
Very nice. See, you can educate yourself here on Amazon's Radio.

922
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:27,720
I still think that we need to buy Konami stock so that we have a say in the company of stockholders.

923
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:29,720
I know, I know, we need to do that.

924
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:35,720
But it's interesting, but this is the interesting thing now that I see here.

925
01:21:35,720 --> 01:21:38,720
I mean, this is kind of, and I'm sorry we're kind of talking about this so we're blue in the face,

926
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:43,720
but, you know, we are a show about rhythm and music games, and this is it, right here.

927
01:21:43,720 --> 01:21:49,720
If things, I really see that if things continue down this path, okay?

928
01:21:49,720 --> 01:21:51,720
Okay, let me finish my thought here.

929
01:21:51,720 --> 01:21:56,720
If things continue down this path, we're not going to be talking about DDR a year from now.

930
01:21:56,720 --> 01:22:00,840
it is going to be talking about In The Groove, because that's what there's going to be.

931
01:22:00,840 --> 01:22:04,080
Because Konami is allowing DDR to get trampled by In The Groove.

932
01:22:04,080 --> 01:22:07,120
In the arcades, anyway. I mean, the home console releases,

933
01:22:07,120 --> 01:22:10,080
you know, there'll still be a little bit of everything, but as far as the arcades,

934
01:22:10,080 --> 01:22:13,680
and where a lot of us met each other, and where a lot of us feel our community

935
01:22:13,680 --> 01:22:16,680
allegiance belongs is the arcade games,

936
01:22:16,680 --> 01:22:20,820
we're going to be talking In The Groove. Maybe even less time than that.

937
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:23,980
Konami, get up off your ass and do something. Jamie?

938
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:25,980
This is just another one that sort of jumped off at me

939
01:22:25,980 --> 01:22:27,400
as I was trying to go to another site.

940
01:22:28,020 --> 01:22:32,360
It was about the use of infringing marks in interstate commerce.

941
01:22:33,100 --> 01:22:34,460
It says any commercial activity

942
01:22:34,460 --> 01:22:37,340
that Congress can regulate is subject to the Lanham Act.

943
01:22:38,020 --> 01:22:43,600
Lanham Act considers an infringing mark used in commerce when it is used or displayed

944
01:22:43,600 --> 01:22:47,780
in the sale or advertising of services, and the services are rendered in commerce

945
01:22:47,780 --> 01:22:50,140
or the services are rendered in more than one state.

946
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:56,140
So, if they're all, you know, they're basically trying to spread this.

947
01:22:56,140 --> 01:23:00,980
You know, we've had, the arcade version has been in a very small area, but you start bringing

948
01:23:00,980 --> 01:23:08,740
out a home release, and that's going to be pretty much, you know, country wide.

949
01:23:08,740 --> 01:23:12,580
I have a feeling that Konami is going to do something about it.

950
01:23:12,580 --> 01:23:16,020
I think it's going to affect their sales in such a way they're going to see this as taking

951
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:17,260
money out of their pocket.

952
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:22,980
I think, I think E3 is going to be hilarious this year, because all these dance games are

953
01:23:22,980 --> 01:23:23,980
going to be shown.

954
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:26,600
Um, I'm so looking forward to it.

955
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,640
I think it's going to be, it's going to be a showdown, and I can't wait, and we'll be

956
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:35,580
podcasting, you gotta get on our podcast, we will be podcasting, if I get to go, which

957
01:23:35,580 --> 01:23:39,700
I'm pretty sure I will, we'll be podcasting every day from E3, and we will bring it to

958
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:43,140
you as it happens, as the drama unfolds at E3.

959
01:23:43,140 --> 01:23:44,860
You betcha.

960
01:23:44,860 --> 01:23:46,580
I will have the laptop with me.

961
01:23:46,580 --> 01:23:53,580
We can update the site, we'll have the orange box, we'll have it all.

962
01:23:53,580 --> 01:23:57,580
A lot of gaming sites will not be able to bring you the news as fast as we're going to be bringing it to you.

963
01:23:57,580 --> 01:23:58,580
It's going to be awesome.

964
01:23:58,580 --> 01:24:00,580
Yeah, just because we're awesome and we're cool.

965
01:24:00,580 --> 01:24:06,580
We are dedicated to spreading the E3 drama throughout the world this year.

966
01:24:06,580 --> 01:24:11,580
Other sites want to be us.

967
01:24:11,580 --> 01:24:23,580
Alright. Now, Jamie, I would encourage you at some point this week or so, go down and give in the groove a try. See what you think.

968
01:24:23,580 --> 01:24:26,580
Maybe when my lungs work again.

969
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:29,580
Yeah, I guess that would kind of slow me down too, but...

970
01:24:29,580 --> 01:24:35,580
And when, you know, CCL isn't the, you know, money stealing sack of...

971
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:40,580
I'm telling you, Wednesday night, nobody's there because everybody's at Rosewood Golf Land because of the arcade mania.

972
01:24:40,580 --> 01:24:46,500
the arcade mania. I know, I know. Angel, you had a comment? I'd go if you guys want to

973
01:24:46,500 --> 01:24:53,140
go over there. I mean, be like piling in the car and be like, okay. Well, I'm probably

974
01:24:53,140 --> 01:24:56,420
going to go again this Wednesday, so we'll see. The only reason I'm saying that is because

975
01:24:56,420 --> 01:25:02,100
I haven't seen it yet and I just wanted to see it for myself and, you know, why not?

976
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:06,760
Then you have another voice going, I didn't know, I was kidding. I just don't want people

977
01:25:06,760 --> 01:25:10,240
out there going, you know, oh, Sky doesn't know what the hell he's talking about because

978
01:25:10,240 --> 01:25:15,420
he's never played In the Groove. No, I've played it, so I think I speak. And I don't

979
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:21,080
hate In the Groove. I think they've got a lot of good ideas, and I think there's a lot

980
01:25:21,080 --> 01:25:25,420
of good things about In the Groove, so please, don't get me wrong, I probably will buy In

981
01:25:25,420 --> 01:25:31,860
the Groove on PlayStation 2, because I... I won't spend my money on it. I have to disagree,

982
01:25:31,860 --> 01:25:35,580
probably will buy it depending on what

983
01:25:35,580 --> 01:25:37,440
depending on what happens with Konami

984
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:39,420
depending on what happens there but if

985
01:25:39,420 --> 01:25:41,100
Konami continues to do nothing then I

986
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:42,580
will buy in the group on PlayStation 2

987
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:46,020
I'm not going to give them my money I

988
01:25:46,020 --> 01:25:49,620
really don't support poor ripoffs so

989
01:25:49,620 --> 01:25:51,740
they don't get my money well let's have

990
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:54,060
to agree to disagree there all right

991
01:25:54,060 --> 01:25:55,860
we're gonna break when we come back

992
01:25:55,860 --> 01:25:57,100
we're gonna talk a little bit about Oh

993
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,060
Loki Loki I don't support for rip poor

994
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:04,380
ripoffs as well however if anyone out there has the in the groove game is

995
01:26:04,380 --> 01:26:08,460
willing to rip the hard drive you don't support the legit copies either okay

996
01:26:08,460 --> 01:26:12,260
yeah I would rather HD load it and steal money from them that would be awesome

997
01:26:12,260 --> 01:26:22,300
and remember kick an ultra K machine all right uh when we get back from this next

998
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:26,140
break I want to talk a little bit about in the groove too because we got news on

999
01:26:26,140 --> 01:26:33,940
that and then I know but but dark Sakura I realize you may have this kind of

1000
01:26:33,940 --> 01:26:36,820
towards in the group right now but let's face it they're the only ones doing

1001
01:26:36,820 --> 01:26:39,460
anything right now

1002
01:26:41,980 --> 01:26:46,660
so we're gonna talk a little bit about that when we come back and then I'm

1003
01:26:46,660 --> 01:26:49,580
gonna open up the Skype line because I know somebody out there is gonna want to

1004
01:26:49,580 --> 01:26:52,600
comment on this so we'll do that and then we're gonna get into the orange

1005
01:26:52,600 --> 01:26:56,480
launch radio cage match so more fun to be had when we come back from this break

1006
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:02,720
and Elmo it suggested we do a themed break of calendar songs so we're going

1007
01:27:02,720 --> 01:27:09,720
do some calendar songs, so we'll be back after this.

1008
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:40,720
I want to make you hurt

1009
01:27:40,720 --> 01:27:43,720
We can fight it

1010
01:27:43,720 --> 01:27:46,720
From the two of us

1011
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:49,720
I know you feel it

1012
01:27:49,720 --> 01:27:53,720
We're letting go

1013
01:27:53,720 --> 01:27:56,720
We can make you hurt

1014
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,720
We can have the power

1015
01:28:29,720 --> 01:28:34,220
And it's time to move

1016
01:28:34,220 --> 01:28:37,220
The music makes you high

1017
01:28:37,220 --> 01:28:40,220
The music and the power

1018
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,720
Every day I watch your everything

1019
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:53,220
Every night I live your every night

1020
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:57,220
Oh, every day I watch your everything

1021
01:28:57,220 --> 01:29:03,220
Every night, I live it every night for all

1022
01:29:03,220 --> 01:29:07,220
I just wanna be with you, I wanna call you

1023
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:14,220
Hachi desu desu achi kamehoseki

1024
01:29:16,220 --> 01:29:22,220
Kamehosei no chumu kimi wo yoko me ni

1025
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:57,220
Oh, they'll die if you remember

1026
01:30:22,220 --> 01:30:41,220
Every night, I hear your voice Baby, every day and every night

1027
01:31:22,220 --> 01:31:29,220
Demon Control!

1028
01:31:29,220 --> 01:31:43,220
Demon Control!

1029
01:32:43,220 --> 01:32:45,220
you

1030
01:33:13,220 --> 01:33:37,820
Come on, shake your love, you can Don't be mad, you'll be all my love

1031
01:33:37,820 --> 01:33:41,420
Let's get everybody down, now how can you feel?

1032
01:33:41,420 --> 01:33:47,420
I just wanna meet you, feel all my heart, you just let me in

1033
01:33:47,420 --> 01:33:53,020
Let me down, let me down

1034
01:33:57,020 --> 01:33:59,020
I gave you to me good

1035
01:33:59,020 --> 01:34:19,500
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, of course we've been talking about In the Groove,

1036
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:24,500
which is something that has really kind of gotten people going in our chat.

1037
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:29,260
This has really been a polarizing thing in the community right now, and it's honestly

1038
01:34:29,260 --> 01:34:34,140
not a surprise, because this is really going to determine the direction of what we're going

1039
01:34:34,140 --> 01:34:37,880
to be talking about a year from now, I think.

1040
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:41,060
So I can see where people, why people feel about this.

1041
01:34:41,060 --> 01:34:45,100
Real quick, I want to go around, take a poll, see how people stand on In the Groove.

1042
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,700
I just kind of want to go around and see what people think of this.

1043
01:34:48,700 --> 01:34:52,060
Love the idea, hate the idea, undecided or what you stand, just kind of like a quick

1044
01:34:52,060 --> 01:34:53,060
couple sentences.

1045
01:34:53,060 --> 01:34:57,060
So, um, um, Jamie, you wanna start? Your thoughts on the game?

1046
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:58,060
Lone cookie.

1047
01:34:58,060 --> 01:35:00,060
Lone cookie. Angel?

1048
01:35:00,060 --> 01:35:05,060
I have no idea since I haven't seen it yet, but maybe that'll change my Wednesday.

1049
01:35:05,060 --> 01:35:14,060
Uh, I am still, you know, the longer that they, uh, how do I phrase this?

1050
01:35:14,060 --> 01:35:18,060
The fact that they are doing this, that they're putting this out on the home console,

1051
01:35:18,060 --> 01:35:22,060
and the fact that the people are kinda, the folks who make the game are out there in the community

1052
01:35:22,060 --> 01:35:27,060
I'm awfully persistent about all this. Kind of actually raises my opinion of the whole thing a little bit.

1053
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:31,060
It makes me feel like they really do want to try and do some good here.

1054
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:39,060
I find the whole thing interesting. The game itself, I'm still, you know, I think there's good things and bad things about it.

1055
01:35:39,060 --> 01:35:49,060
It's an okay game, I welcome it, but I have concerns. That's my long, sordid, blown up answer.

1056
01:35:49,060 --> 01:35:54,060
Arkadian42 who joined us during the last break there. Hi friend, how are you?

1057
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:55,060
I'm doing okay.

1058
01:35:55,060 --> 01:35:58,060
So you walked into our big discussion on In The Groove, what do you think?

1059
01:35:58,060 --> 01:36:03,060
It's okay, I haven't played it so I don't, I can't really comment on the gameplay, but

1060
01:36:03,060 --> 01:36:06,060
hey, if they're coming out with it, that's fine by me.

1061
01:36:06,060 --> 01:36:11,060
Hey, why not? So that's kind of Arkadian say, hey, why not? Hey, why not?

1062
01:36:11,060 --> 01:36:12,060
Loki.

1063
01:36:12,060 --> 01:36:13,060
You wanna buy it?

1064
01:36:13,060 --> 01:36:15,060
Loki says hate it, he's yelling from the kitchen.

1065
01:36:15,060 --> 01:36:16,060
He hated it.

1066
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:25,700
All right, we're going to open up the Skype line for you guys, but we need to get to this

1067
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:31,580
bit first, because I know somebody will bring this up on the Skype line, so we want to mention

1068
01:36:31,580 --> 01:36:37,180
this so that, you know, you guys kind of know everything before we just open up the Skype

1069
01:36:37,180 --> 01:36:41,100
line. Those of you guys that get most of your Bahmani news here on this show, which actually,

1070
01:36:41,100 --> 01:36:44,260
you know, there are some people who pretty much get most of their Bahmani news here on

1071
01:36:44,260 --> 01:36:51,020
the show. Uh, In the Groove 2 is happening. It is happening, it is coming out, they showed

1072
01:36:51,020 --> 01:36:56,460
it at the Amusement Showcase International 2005 show. Here's the interesting thing about

1073
01:36:56,460 --> 01:36:59,500
In the Groove 2, actually there's several interesting things about In the Groove 2.

1074
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:07,500
A, brand new cabinet. So no longer will In the Groove be stowing away, not necessarily.

1075
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:11,580
You'll be doing upgrades for regular cabinets too? Okay, they'll be doing upgrades for the

1076
01:37:11,580 --> 01:37:15,620
regular cabinets too but in the groove 2 will have its own new cabinet and if you

1077
01:37:15,620 --> 01:37:19,740
wonder why the cabinet looks just like a pump-it-up cabinet that's because

1078
01:37:19,740 --> 01:37:23,100
Andy Mero is in on it now too. Andy Mero is going to be doing the cabinets for

1079
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:27,540
in the groove 2 or are they... is Andy Mero actually doing the cabinets? They are

1080
01:37:27,540 --> 01:37:34,620
doing the cabinets this Loki. Song list very interesting all the songs from in

1081
01:37:34,620 --> 01:37:39,100
the groove 1 are coming back no cuts and then there's going to be some brand new

1082
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:46,020
songs in In The Groove, I'm sorry, some brand new songs in In The Groove 2 as well, which

1083
01:37:46,020 --> 01:37:53,640
include Typical Tropical by Bambi from DDR Solo, which you first heard that, Spaceman

1084
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:59,160
by Lynn, who, now that's the weird thing because Spaceman was actually a Bambi song, so we're

1085
01:37:59,160 --> 01:38:06,480
not quite sure why the title changed there, perhaps it's a, well maybe not, it could be

1086
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:12,180
a cover or it could be a artist went solo or something who knows I don't know

1087
01:38:12,180 --> 01:38:16,140
but regardless spaceman is going to be in there and that's one of the songs

1088
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:22,980
that's in rotation on our station at right now actually and then what was the

1089
01:38:22,980 --> 01:38:29,180
one sunshine by triple j you know this is follow the Sun from DDR third mix now

1090
01:38:29,180 --> 01:38:32,700
of course I'm blatantly mentioning the songs that seem to be crossing over from

1091
01:38:32,700 --> 01:38:37,440
the games we already know there's a whole list there's already announced 50

1092
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:41,880
new songs I didn't see a whole lot else that really caught my attention little

1093
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,760
kitty mine I thought that was interesting because that's by Nini who

1094
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:49,140
did a lot of the dance mania songs as well as spacey crazy girl by Nini is

1095
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:52,760
going to be in it as well and the message some new car songs those you

1096
01:38:52,760 --> 01:38:57,960
guys like him he's kind of the Naoki Twilight travel style some new songs

1097
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:04,800
there. Very interesting. So those are some new songs that are gonna be in In the

1098
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:11,700
Groove 2. In the Groove 2 has a very red interface. People are noticing not a

1099
01:39:11,700 --> 01:39:18,960
whole lot of huge changes, but novice mode being one big change and just the

1100
01:39:18,960 --> 01:39:26,300
cabinet and the new songs being another change as well. So very interesting. Okay

1101
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:48,300
Okay, so, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna go ahead and open up the Skype line, so if you want to talk to us, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can call in on the Skype line, because I know some folks have very deep-lying opinions on this, so I'm very curious to hear what some of our listeners have to say.

1102
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:50,300
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1103
01:39:50,300 --> 01:39:51,300
Hi.

1104
01:39:51,300 --> 01:39:52,300
Hi, who's this?

1105
01:39:52,300 --> 01:39:54,300
Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

1106
01:39:54,300 --> 01:39:59,300
Hello, Sephiroth1215. Now this is your first time calling, isn't it? Or first or second?

1107
01:39:59,300 --> 01:40:01,300
Yeah, this is my first time.

1108
01:40:01,300 --> 01:40:07,300
Hello, Newbie! Hi, Newbie! No, I'm kidding. What are your thoughts on In the Groove?

1109
01:40:07,300 --> 01:40:15,300
Um, I actually think it's not that bad, just because DDR is kinda going downhill now.

1110
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,300
So you think DDR is going downhill?

1111
01:40:17,300 --> 01:40:21,300
Yeah, but this might be bringing it back up, hopefully.

1112
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:29,300
What about DDR do you think is going downhill? Do you think that DDR Extreme on Playstation was the wrong direction, or what?

1113
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:31,300
Oh yeah, most definitely.

1114
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,300
So you weren't a fan of the recent home releases?

1115
01:40:34,300 --> 01:40:45,300
Um, you know, I like, the song list wasn't bad, it's just all the bugs and the interface especially really sucked.

1116
01:40:45,300 --> 01:40:51,300
Now, you know, it's interesting because I kind of feel like, whereas DDR Extreme for

1117
01:40:51,300 --> 01:40:56,100
PlayStation, this is just me personally, whereas I think DDR Extreme on PlayStation could have

1118
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:59,580
been a little bit better, I think there were some areas for improvement there, I think

1119
01:40:59,580 --> 01:41:05,460
UltraMix 2 fucking just knocked the house down. I thought it was a great DDR release.

1120
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:09,940
But you don't have a, you don't feel the same on UltraMix 2 or?

1121
01:41:09,940 --> 01:41:19,940
Yeah, actually I do. It seems like Konami doesn't seem to really do much about Hawaii over there.

1122
01:41:19,940 --> 01:41:26,940
I mean, if they let them do, if they did the PS2 mixes even, it would be great.

1123
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:31,940
Now I understand that, because UltraMix 2 kind of feels like the sideshow at the circus, doesn't it?

1124
01:41:31,940 --> 01:41:34,940
Even though it deserves to be on the main stage.

1125
01:41:34,940 --> 01:41:37,940
It's like when you go to one of those big festivals like Lollapalooza or something,

1126
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:43,940
And like the best band you see all day is playing on the second stage. That's kind of how Ultramix 2 is right now.

1127
01:41:43,940 --> 01:41:51,940
Yeah, I feel the same way. I mean, Ultramix 2 is great and if they just pay more attention to it...

1128
01:41:51,940 --> 01:41:59,940
Yeah, the first words out of my mouth after I played Ultramix 2 was Konami of Hawaii should be doing the next DDR release in the arcades.

1129
01:41:59,940 --> 01:42:16,940
And I still think that, but I, yeah, exactly, they should, not that my opinion matters any, or your opinion when it comes to, you know, the big picture over there or whatever the suits are thinking at Konami, but, hey, if it were up to me, Hawaii would be working on a new arcade mix right now. And we'd have tons of different drum songs in it.

1130
01:42:16,940 --> 01:42:29,940
Yeah, I just feel that Hawaii kind of stays more towards fans, instead of, you know, the PS2 mixes, which tries to bring along more newcomers with all these songs that everybody knows.

1131
01:42:29,940 --> 01:42:40,940
Absolutely, I can see that too. You know, a lot of fans worked on UltraMix too. A really good friend of the shows, or a couple of them, were working on UltraMix too, so that was kind of neat that they got to be a part of that, so...

1132
01:42:40,940 --> 01:42:41,940
Yeah.

1133
01:42:41,940 --> 01:42:50,940
Okay, so back to In The Groove for a minute. Have you actually gotten a chance to play In The Groove, or are you just kind of watching all this debate going on from the sidelines, just trying to keep an open mind?

1134
01:42:50,940 --> 01:43:02,940
I watched it and, you know, after that I downloaded all the sim files from and played them. I mean, the songs aren't too bad. I mean, some of the steps are kind of ridiculous, though.

1135
01:43:02,940 --> 01:43:08,940
Yeah, some of the expert stuff is a little ridiculous, I can certainly agree with that.

1136
01:43:08,940 --> 01:43:16,940
But I gotta tell you though, downloading it and playing it on StepMania, and actually playing it inside an arcade machine, it's very different.

1137
01:43:16,940 --> 01:43:24,940
StepMania does not have the same feel in an arcade machine that it does on the home. I don't know how to explain it, it's just kind of the way I see it.

1138
01:43:24,940 --> 01:43:31,940
Well yeah, there is one in the area that hopefully I get to play some day soon, but until then.

1139
01:43:31,940 --> 01:43:35,540
them just kind of watching the debate so you just kind of think that in the groove

1140
01:43:35,540 --> 01:43:42,460
it's just something new and so why not is that kind of what I'm hearing? At first I kind of

1141
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:47,700
didn't care about it too much but I mean Red Octane is putting it out there and

1142
01:43:47,700 --> 01:43:52,260
they're they've been pretty good with their pads and everything so I'm sure

1143
01:43:52,260 --> 01:43:57,460
they're gonna do what they can. Yeah I think they're right. And if their success is I'm

1144
01:43:57,460 --> 01:44:01,460
I'm sure they'll probably do something else even bigger than this.

1145
01:44:01,460 --> 01:44:07,460
It's going to be very interesting. I think what Loki said earlier is a very interesting...

1146
01:44:07,460 --> 01:44:14,460
Because Red Octane doesn't just put out the dance pads. They put out five key controllers and other sorts of knockoffs for various games too.

1147
01:44:14,460 --> 01:44:18,460
I think what you said is right on. If In the Groove does well, we're going to start seeing a five...

1148
01:44:18,460 --> 01:44:20,460
We're going to see a five key meeting game.

1149
01:44:20,460 --> 01:44:24,460
They've already said they're going to do it. It's not a surprise. They've already said they were going to do it.

1150
01:44:24,460 --> 01:44:32,020
so it'll come I just you watch the end yeah well if they could beat Konami to

1151
01:44:32,020 --> 01:44:36,580
beat me in the u.s. I mean they'll definitely own that and it's just gonna

1152
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:40,460
be interesting to see how long will Konami just sit and watch this happen

1153
01:44:40,460 --> 01:44:45,460
maybe they probably just don't care as much maybe it's kind of sad I don't know

1154
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:50,500
I feel like I'm not important I feel like Konami doesn't love me Konami won't

1155
01:44:50,500 --> 01:44:57,500
Don't stand up for me. Mom, I'm being picked on at school. Why won't you say anything to the principal about it?

1156
01:44:57,500 --> 01:45:01,500
That's kind of how I feel.

1157
01:45:01,500 --> 01:45:05,500
Alright, any other thoughts on the group?

1158
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:09,500
Not really. I understand you probably have many more callers, so...

1159
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:13,500
Not really. We're not that popular of a show. Not a lot of people listen to us.

1160
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:18,500
We're going to let you go now, just in case. We should open the line back up.

1161
01:45:18,500 --> 01:45:22,640
Okay, all right. Well. Thanks for your call and have a good one all right later

1162
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:26,100
It's good to hear from new people once in a while, so

1163
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:29,280
It's good to hear from him, and I just darn it

1164
01:45:29,280 --> 01:45:33,060
I hung up on the person who tried to call in next there is hello. You're on orange on radio

1165
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:39,500
Hey, this is all mullet. Hello. Sorry for hanging up on you there. That's name ever. I was trying to hang up

1166
01:45:39,500 --> 01:45:45,080
I'm a last caller and I accidentally hung up on you instead. Oh, no problems. I get that a lot all right

1167
01:45:45,080 --> 01:45:46,960
What's on your mind, buddy? Oh?

1168
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:50,260
Oh, you're talking about In The Groove. I figured I'll talk about In The Groove.

1169
01:45:50,260 --> 01:45:59,360
I would love to hear your thoughts on In The Groove because you made a great post on the DDR Freak thread about In The Groove, so I definitely want to hear it. I want to hear your thoughts.

1170
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:08,560
Basically, I can't hate In The Groove because I haven't played In The Groove. There's no machine in Maryland and nothing. I don't want to cross state lines in order to play a dancing game.

1171
01:46:08,560 --> 01:46:13,060
Now, hold on though, hold on though, before you talk about that you can't hate in the groove for that reason,

1172
01:46:13,060 --> 01:46:17,060
I think there is still reason to hate in the groove, even if you haven't played it,

1173
01:46:17,060 --> 01:46:23,060
because of the fact that, you know, it's kinda like it's invading DDR's turf.

1174
01:46:23,060 --> 01:46:29,060
It's like the Crips are coming into the Bloods territory, and you know, you're gonna pull a knife on them.

1175
01:46:29,060 --> 01:46:31,060
Right, I'm gonna get into that, just let me...

1176
01:46:31,060 --> 01:46:34,060
Alright, alright, I'm sorry, I am sorry Elmoley, go ahead and finish that.

1177
01:46:34,060 --> 01:46:40,060
Okay, the second half of the sentence is that I hate the fan base, they are psychotic.

1178
01:46:43,060 --> 01:46:48,060
As soon as the announcement was made that it was coming to the home market, all I hear is,

1179
01:46:48,060 --> 01:46:56,060
Oh my God, this is going to be the savior of the world, if you don't like it, you're a Satan, you should be castrated, and all this stuff.

1180
01:46:56,060 --> 01:47:10,060
I agree with you there, In The Groove, not the entire, I know some great people in the In The Groove fanbase, don't get me wrong, there's some really great people, but like a large chunk of the In The Groove fanbase, oh my god, oh my god.

1181
01:47:10,060 --> 01:47:21,060
DDR is not dead. Stop dancing on the grave of DDR because DDR has no grave yet. They will have releases this year. I have utmost faith DDR will continue.

1182
01:47:21,060 --> 01:47:24,860
if they sold a million copies last year alone exactly let's just pull the plug out

1183
01:47:24,860 --> 01:47:27,940
exactly you don't put out a press release like that and then pull the plug on it

1184
01:47:27,940 --> 01:47:31,260
although we're so happy we made the money but that's all we're going to make

1185
01:47:31,260 --> 01:47:32,880
we're starting again

1186
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:37,300
it sometimes feels that way doesn't it sorry Elmo go ahead

1187
01:47:37,300 --> 01:47:41,340
well anyway as far as in the groove goes i'm sure it's not a bad game i'm sure

1188
01:47:41,340 --> 01:47:42,420
that i'll have

1189
01:47:42,420 --> 01:47:44,280
fun with it i'm going to

1190
01:47:44,280 --> 01:47:47,420
buy it i'll probably be the one who reviews it for inside pulse

1191
01:47:47,420 --> 01:47:53,020
but I'm sure it's not going to be the ultra-savior of this thing either.

1192
01:47:53,020 --> 01:47:57,300
But I do have a prediction. I have a prediction that could be very feasible

1193
01:47:57,300 --> 01:48:00,300
since In the Groove is being published by Red Octane.

1194
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:04,740
I'm going to... I love predictions. I love predictions and making stuff up.

1195
01:48:04,740 --> 01:48:06,500
This is great. Okay, what is it?

1196
01:48:06,500 --> 01:48:07,780
There will be

1197
01:48:07,780 --> 01:48:10,060
in-game advertising

1198
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:13,140
for the Red Octane ignition pads

1199
01:48:13,140 --> 01:48:15,940
and for their metal pads.

1200
01:48:15,940 --> 01:48:17,940
Absolutely. I hear you there.

1201
01:48:17,940 --> 01:48:18,940
That goes without saying.

1202
01:48:18,940 --> 01:48:20,940
Absolutely. It's got to happen.

1203
01:48:20,940 --> 01:48:25,940
Just like how Konami advertised the Dance Mania CDs, I think they'll be a very similar sort of advertisement.

1204
01:48:25,940 --> 01:48:31,940
And when you see the little figure dancing, it'll be on a red octane pad. Absolutely. I think you're absolutely right on that.

1205
01:48:31,940 --> 01:48:39,940
Exactly. And it's going to be very interesting to see, hey, do you suck right now? Buy a technician pad. Only $100.

1206
01:48:39,940 --> 01:48:40,940
And then you can pass that...

1207
01:48:40,940 --> 01:48:41,940
Do you still suck?

1208
01:48:41,940 --> 01:48:47,940
Then you can pass that fucking insane 13-footer with all the fucking useless hand plants in it, you know, it's just...

1209
01:48:47,940 --> 01:48:52,940
And do you still suck? Do you want to pass our expert zones? Buy our metal pad!

1210
01:48:53,940 --> 01:48:54,440
Seriously?

1211
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:56,940
It's only $100 less than the best one on the market.

1212
01:48:58,940 --> 01:48:59,940
I can see that happening.

1213
01:49:00,940 --> 01:49:03,940
How about In The Groove 2? What are your thoughts on what you've seen on that so far?

1214
01:49:04,940 --> 01:49:10,940
I just caught the story a couple hours ago, and when I first saw that there was going to be a brand new cabinet made for it,

1215
01:49:10,940 --> 01:49:17,940
I think that the first thing I thought was a very, very good move on Rock Store's part for getting a new cabinet.

1216
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:25,940
It will further differentiate themselves from Dance Dance Revolution, especially since they're not going to be solely piggybacking off their hardware.

1217
01:49:25,940 --> 01:49:35,940
I agree to an extent. I don't think they're going to win over anybody who was anti-In-The-Groove because of the fact that it's invading DDR's turf.

1218
01:49:35,940 --> 01:49:40,300
turf I don't think they're gonna win anybody over with that but I think they

1219
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:44,380
may win over some arcade owners which is the important part really if you think

1220
01:49:44,380 --> 01:49:49,180
about it whoever they went over is negligible at this point I'm just saying

1221
01:49:49,180 --> 01:49:55,980
that that this way in the groove looks more separate from DDR than currently

1222
01:49:55,980 --> 01:50:01,220
because now we can because all the in the groove was beforehand was enough

1223
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:05,220
was a simple upgrade kit for any and all DDR machines.

1224
01:50:05,220 --> 01:50:08,860
It was DDR ITG mix, really.

1225
01:50:08,860 --> 01:50:15,420
Exactly. It's going to be very interesting this year. I've said it as soon as

1226
01:50:15,420 --> 01:50:19,220
Pump It Up received home release this year. This is going to be the best year

1227
01:50:19,220 --> 01:50:23,540
for dance games on the whole. It's either going to be the best year, or it's going to be the worst year.

1228
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:28,160
It could all be over after this year, honestly. It could. I think that's, I think

1229
01:50:28,160 --> 01:50:30,740
that's a possibility that

1230
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:34,060
These dance games all do fair

1231
01:50:34,060 --> 01:50:38,500
and they all cancel each other out. And that's a distinct possibility.

1232
01:50:38,500 --> 01:50:42,220
But I think that E3 is going to be a very interesting show this year.

1233
01:50:42,220 --> 01:50:45,460
I'm very much looking forward to E3. I wish I could go.

1234
01:50:45,460 --> 01:50:48,460
Final exams are a bitch because I can't.

1235
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:53,540
That sucks, man. Well, try to live vicariously through us. I don't know what

1236
01:50:53,540 --> 01:50:55,860
other consolation I can give you, but we will be there.

1237
01:50:55,860 --> 01:50:59,180
Don't worry, I will try. We're going to be fielding questions and everything.

1238
01:50:59,180 --> 01:51:02,260
so hopefully you guys will get to live vicariously through us.

1239
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:04,820
Alright, any other thoughts?

1240
01:51:04,820 --> 01:51:08,180
That's about it. Alright. Have they said who's publishing

1241
01:51:08,180 --> 01:51:11,540
Pump It Up yet?

1242
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:15,180
Who was it? Madesco? Maybe? Mastiff Games.

1243
01:51:15,180 --> 01:51:18,180
Mastiff was making it, but they weren't publishing it, were they?

1244
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:21,420
I thought they were just the ones making it, and Anamiro themselves was publishing it.

1245
01:51:21,420 --> 01:51:25,420
It's the other way around. Anamiro is the

1246
01:51:25,420 --> 01:51:29,820
the maker of pump it up and well the fastest games are

1247
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:33,700
what the fuck do I know alright it's all good

1248
01:51:33,700 --> 01:51:38,060
alright Elmo thanks for the call no problem I'll wait like plug your site

1249
01:51:38,060 --> 01:51:41,180
inside polls that come there you go alright have a good one

1250
01:51:41,180 --> 01:51:44,420
by by I definitely wanna get old

1251
01:51:44,420 --> 01:51:48,440
damages there wasn't well there was another call coming on the line here

1252
01:51:48,440 --> 01:51:50,340
goodies contact and I think this is somebody

1253
01:51:50,340 --> 01:51:53,820
who supports a lot of what in the group is doing from what I hear the chair

1254
01:51:53,820 --> 01:51:54,820
This should be a good call.

1255
01:51:54,820 --> 01:51:56,820
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1256
01:51:56,820 --> 01:51:58,820
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

1257
01:51:58,820 --> 01:52:00,820
Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

1258
01:52:00,820 --> 01:52:01,820
Pretty good.

1259
01:52:01,820 --> 01:52:02,820
Pretty good.

1260
01:52:02,820 --> 01:52:06,820
Now, this has got to be your first or second call into the station as well, right?

1261
01:52:06,820 --> 01:52:07,820
Yeah, my first.

1262
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:08,820
Your first?

1263
01:52:08,820 --> 01:52:09,820
Oh, another virgin!

1264
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,820
Welcome to the show.

1265
01:52:11,820 --> 01:52:12,820
Thank you for calling in.

1266
01:52:12,820 --> 01:52:17,820
Now, I know you've got some opinions on the In The Groove stuff, so let's hear it.

1267
01:52:17,820 --> 01:52:18,820
Yeah, I got a little opinion.

1268
01:52:18,820 --> 01:52:19,820
What's up?

1269
01:52:19,820 --> 01:52:22,820
I actually got a little story beforehand about it.

1270
01:52:22,820 --> 01:52:34,820
I've been to Phoenix, Arizona. They just got in the groove, I think. Well, I went to the arcade, and so I went.

1271
01:52:52,820 --> 01:52:53,820
Can you hear me now?

1272
01:52:53,820 --> 01:52:55,820
Uh, he's still a little bit broken up.

1273
01:52:57,820 --> 01:53:00,820
You know what? Try calling us right back, bud. Try doing that.

1274
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:02,820
Let's see if that helps. Later.

1275
01:53:02,820 --> 01:53:04,820
Okay, I'm gonna go ahead and let him call right back,

1276
01:53:04,820 --> 01:53:07,820
because sometimes that helps the connection a little bit, just to kind of redo it there,

1277
01:53:07,820 --> 01:53:09,820
because I want to let him have a chance to talk.

1278
01:53:09,820 --> 01:53:11,820
All right, you there?

1279
01:53:11,820 --> 01:53:12,820
Yeah, I'm here.

1280
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:14,820
Okay, it's clear again. Tell your story.

1281
01:53:14,820 --> 01:53:21,820
Okay. Anyways, I went to, uh, Golf Land, and they had a, ran over there, jumped on it.

1282
01:53:21,820 --> 01:53:30,820
I have to put in my money for it. And I realized it wasn't in the groove, it just had, like, the stuff all around it and it ended up being a third mix DDR machine.

1283
01:53:30,820 --> 01:53:39,820
That's kind of like that mega mix DDR. It looks like an Xtreme, but oh my god. Don't fall off.

1284
01:53:39,820 --> 01:53:50,820
But, you know what, I've yet to try it, and I want to give everything a chance like I do with Red Sox fans and German people, so...

1285
01:53:50,820 --> 01:53:56,820
Now, I thought you were somebody in our chatroom, because I mentioned this before I picked up your call,

1286
01:53:56,820 --> 01:54:01,820
I thought you were somebody in the chatroom that was really supporting everything that the Rockstar folks are doing within The Groove,

1287
01:54:01,820 --> 01:54:05,820
and are pretty open-minded to what's going on here. Is that true, or...?

1288
01:54:05,820 --> 01:54:09,820
Oh, shit, I guess I'm getting you confused with somebody else. My bad, I'm sorry.

1289
01:54:09,820 --> 01:54:10,820
Okay.

1290
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:15,820
Alright, so you're just more having an open mind to In the Groove and what's going on?

1291
01:54:15,820 --> 01:54:18,820
Yeah, I'll try it out when it comes.

1292
01:54:18,820 --> 01:54:24,820
Alright, sounds good. What do you think about the impact this is going to have on DDR?

1293
01:54:24,820 --> 01:54:31,820
Well, you know what, I'm sure DDR will come up with something. Everything happens for a reason, so we'll see.

1294
01:54:31,820 --> 01:54:39,820
Is it maybe the release of In the Groove will kind of light a fire under Konami of America's ass to do something new with DDR?

1295
01:54:41,820 --> 01:54:49,820
We'll see, I don't know. I think In the Groove knows that Konami will kick their ass either way, so...

1296
01:54:50,820 --> 01:54:53,820
It's like all we have to do is just release another game in your own, so...

1297
01:54:54,820 --> 01:54:58,820
So you think regardless of this In the Groove pump it up stuff, Konami will still be king in the end?

1298
01:54:58,820 --> 01:55:03,740
probably I agree with that but I still think in the groove has the potential to

1299
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:10,860
make a pretty fat dent so look you look like you want to say no no I think so I

1300
01:55:10,860 --> 01:55:15,140
you don't think that on the red octane pads that everybody buys because Konami

1301
01:55:15,140 --> 01:55:20,060
doesn't do their own pads anymore I mean they do but in such limited release it's

1302
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:24,820
negligent so that the red on these red octane pads they won't try to sell in

1303
01:55:24,820 --> 01:55:28,260
the groove and you won't start seeing bundle packs of in the groove with these

1304
01:55:28,260 --> 01:55:32,940
red octane pads everywhere. Well I'm sure you'll see packs within the groove, but no

1305
01:55:32,940 --> 01:55:36,980
one buys a dance pad without knowing the game they're going to play for it. That's just

1306
01:55:36,980 --> 01:55:41,700
retarded. What about grandmas buying it for their kids? Because they hear on the news

1307
01:55:41,700 --> 01:55:46,940
about the dance game that makes people lose weight, and they all look the same to her.

1308
01:55:46,940 --> 01:55:56,940
Well that's- Grandma you saying I'm fat? Now that's just- Hey what's that? No that's just

1309
01:55:56,940 --> 01:55:58,980
That's just a Skype message, sorry go ahead.

1310
01:55:58,980 --> 01:56:06,720
That's just Grandma on TV, but Grandma might not know, and so she'll ask the teenager working

1311
01:56:06,720 --> 01:56:10,600
behind the counter, whoa what game does this work for, and they'll be like, well that works

1312
01:56:10,600 --> 01:56:14,060
for Dance Dance Revolution, because that's the one they're familiar with, and not like,

1313
01:56:14,060 --> 01:56:17,860
you know, that works with Britney's Dance Beat, you know, or something like that.

1314
01:56:17,860 --> 01:56:23,740
So they're going to, DDR is kind of like, you know, it's kind of like Kleenex, instead

1315
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:30,340
of being, you know, a tissue, it's a Kleenex, you know, something like that.

1316
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:35,820
There was a whole semantics argument about this in the Quirks animated thing, but it's

1317
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:36,820
Xerox.

1318
01:56:36,820 --> 01:56:41,780
It actually is a, I don't remember the exact terminology, but once a product becomes so

1319
01:56:41,780 --> 01:56:46,340
familiar that any product is known by that name, then it loses its trademark.

1320
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:54,940
yeah it's like you know for example like gelatin you know or a band-aid okay it's

1321
01:56:54,940 --> 01:56:58,940
not a band-aid it's an adhesive strip right right you know something like that

1322
01:56:58,940 --> 01:57:04,140
well people are gonna be buying you know that's fine go ahead and buy in the

1323
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:07,340
groove you know go ahead and buy it for your kids but when they go to try to

1324
01:57:07,340 --> 01:57:10,860
play it and they're gonna get bored with it and they're gonna return it well we'll see

1325
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:13,500
I got to get back I want to get back to the collar though because the collar is

1326
01:57:13,500 --> 01:57:17,500
So anything else you want to share with us, SSJ100Matt, on your thoughts on the group?

1327
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:21,500
Yeah, one more thing besides in the group.

1328
01:57:21,500 --> 01:57:25,500
My arcade just got a Beatmania Red 2DX machine.

1329
01:57:25,500 --> 01:57:27,500
Ah, very cool. What do you think of that?

1330
01:57:27,500 --> 01:57:32,500
Well, you know, I'm not a real big fan of it, because, you know, I've tried it a couple times, and, you know,

1331
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:37,500
I usually get yelled at or, like, get dirty looks by the people who actually do play it.

1332
01:57:37,500 --> 01:57:43,500
Okay, don't let those people, those people are just, oh god, those people annoy me more than anybody else.

1333
01:57:43,500 --> 01:57:47,500
More than any rabid foaming-at-the-mouth-in-the-groove fan.

1334
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:50,500
Dude, the 2DX Elitists piss me off. Seriously.

1335
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:54,500
Do not let those guys stare you down.

1336
01:57:54,500 --> 01:57:59,500
You put your money in, you waited just as long as they did to play, you put your money in the machine,

1337
01:57:59,500 --> 01:58:04,500
you have the right to play whatever song you want, however you want, and they can just sit there and wait their turn.

1338
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:08,500
Well, you know, I'm a New Yorker, so I don't really give a shit what they say either way, so...

1339
01:58:08,500 --> 01:58:12,500
Well, amen to that, I guess. All right.

1340
01:58:12,500 --> 01:58:16,500
Well, yeah, well, there's plenty of other people, you know, with DDR who do that.

1341
01:58:16,500 --> 01:58:20,500
Or just like that, you know, that goes out to, uh,

1342
01:58:20,500 --> 01:58:24,500
Danbury and Palisades people.

1343
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:28,500
All right, all right, watch out, those guys. All right. Well,

1344
01:58:28,500 --> 01:58:32,500
good luck with all that, and just, you know, just...

1345
01:58:32,500 --> 01:58:36,500
Don't let those people get in the way. Just, you know, have fun with it.

1346
01:58:36,500 --> 01:58:38,500
Alright. Have a good one.

1347
01:58:38,500 --> 01:58:47,500
And Rob, to go back to what you were saying about the DDR and, um, you know, in the groove bundles, that type of thing, where they're not gonna know the difference.

1348
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:55,500
Well, okay. Well that's the case. Who the fuck's gonna buy an ignition pad when they can buy a bundle with DDR for 60 bucks?

1349
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:58,500
But how often do you see those bundles with DDRs?

1350
01:58:58,500 --> 01:59:05,620
depends where you go like fries i haven't seen bundles there since the week the ddr came out

1351
01:59:07,220 --> 01:59:11,060
they'll be around trust me i i don't know i disagree all right let's say one more

1352
01:59:11,060 --> 01:59:13,700
quick call then we got to get into the cage match and all that stuff hi you're on orange

1353
01:59:13,700 --> 01:59:21,220
homes radio hi my name is ronman oh i'm an olraholic hello olraholic hail the ol army

1354
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:23,220
Hail to the O.L. Army!

1355
01:59:23,220 --> 01:59:24,220
Hail, Kai!

1356
01:59:24,220 --> 01:59:25,220
Humvee!

1357
01:59:25,220 --> 01:59:26,220
What?

1358
01:59:26,220 --> 01:59:27,220
Humvee?

1359
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:28,220
Humvee.

1360
01:59:28,220 --> 01:59:29,220
Humvee.

1361
01:59:29,220 --> 01:59:30,220
What's on your mind, Rama?

1362
01:59:30,220 --> 01:59:31,220
Not much.

1363
01:59:31,220 --> 01:59:32,220
I just want to say a couple of things.

1364
01:59:32,220 --> 01:59:33,220
Yes.

1365
01:59:33,220 --> 01:59:34,220
About the whole in the group.

1366
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:35,220
I'm all for it.

1367
01:59:35,220 --> 01:59:36,220
I'm happy for it.

1368
01:59:36,220 --> 01:59:37,220
Because I like to see more games.

1369
01:59:37,220 --> 01:59:38,220
That's all it is.

1370
01:59:38,220 --> 01:59:39,220
I'm happy for it.

1371
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:41,220
You just want the game orgy.

1372
01:59:41,220 --> 01:59:43,220
Hey, I'm all for it.

1373
01:59:43,220 --> 01:59:46,220
This gives me a reason to go out and buy it.

1374
01:59:46,220 --> 01:59:47,220
That's all.

1375
01:59:47,220 --> 01:59:48,220
I'm having fun with playing DDR.

1376
01:59:48,220 --> 01:59:49,220
You know?

1377
01:59:49,220 --> 01:59:50,220
In the group?

1378
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:54,860
it up, I'll buy it. I think that's a fair perspective to have and I kind of feel a little

1379
01:59:54,860 --> 01:59:59,860
bit similar. Although part of my mentality is that whole blood crips thing where I don't

1380
01:59:59,860 --> 02:00:04,480
think that they should be invading on my turf in the group. On the other hand, I'm kind

1381
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:08,980
of like, you know what, but it's just another game and will it entertain me for at least

1382
02:00:08,980 --> 02:00:15,200
30 minutes? Regardless, that game will entertain me more than, I don't know, Barbie Fashion

1383
02:00:15,200 --> 02:00:23,120
mall will. I was so anti pump it up for the longest and then um saw some hot chick

1384
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:27,640
playing it I was like I'm gonna start playing that game. You know what I know

1385
02:00:27,640 --> 02:00:30,900
I know I'm gonna hurt some people with this but I kind of enjoy in the groove a

1386
02:00:30,900 --> 02:00:35,320
little more than pump it up already. But have you seen I love the verses mode on

1387
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:40,640
it. Oh and in the groove? Yes they throw if I remember correctly the computer

1388
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:44,120
throws random modifiers at you while you're playing the song. You know what

1389
02:00:44,120 --> 02:01:08,120
I'm glad Rama brought that up, because I wanted to say, that is another thing that In the Groove has going for it, is that it is incorporating the battle mode, and I always said, I've said this for years now, how long have we been doing this show? Years!

1390
02:01:08,120 --> 02:01:11,160
I've been saying that the future of DDR,

1391
02:01:11,160 --> 02:01:15,280
if DDR wants to evolve, there is a competitive as hell

1392
02:01:15,280 --> 02:01:19,240
dance game waiting to happen in the form of a dance magic

1393
02:01:19,240 --> 02:01:24,080
based game. And at least In the Groove is trying to go there a little bit.

1394
02:01:24,080 --> 02:01:27,360
I think that still is getting the back seat,

1395
02:01:27,360 --> 02:01:30,480
but I give them props for going there.

1396
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:34,680
Where Konami has not gone there. You know, when it comes down to, you know, oh we're making the game

1397
02:01:34,680 --> 02:01:36,280
for the fans, at least they can go,

1398
02:01:36,280 --> 02:01:40,980
Well, the fans want it faster! As in, you know, Extreme Plus or something like that.

1399
02:01:40,980 --> 02:01:44,780
At least they're kind of, you know, catering it towards the fans and that type of thing.

1400
02:01:44,780 --> 02:01:52,280
And to be honest, if Konami's not gonna do anything about it, then, well, they deserve to lose the market share for it, because, hey, it's their own damn fault.

1401
02:01:52,280 --> 02:01:58,980
You know, we can't be, you know, buying every game they make, even if we don't like it, just because we want to support Konami.

1402
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:03,580
Fuck that! If there's something better out there, I'll go buy the something better. That's the way it works.

1403
02:02:03,580 --> 02:02:11,580
So, you know what? They gotta get on their game, because if they don't do something, they are gonna lose that portion of it, and you know what?

1404
02:02:11,580 --> 02:02:19,580
Karaoke Revolution ain't gonna be making that much money. Trust me, it's getting old already. And they gotta do something.

1405
02:02:19,580 --> 02:02:20,580
Alright.

1406
02:02:20,580 --> 02:02:27,580
I still go back to, I think it's, we don't know what tricks Konami has up their sleeve. They could trump us all, and announce that E3...

1407
02:02:27,580 --> 02:02:28,580
I don't think so.

1408
02:02:28,580 --> 02:02:35,580
You know what? We don't know. But they could trump this whole fucking thing, and at E3 this year, they announced 2DX USA.

1409
02:02:35,580 --> 02:02:37,580
They could, but...

1410
02:02:37,580 --> 02:02:40,580
That would be the biggest F you to all of us.

1411
02:02:40,580 --> 02:02:46,580
They could do that, but I think I know the reason why Konami is just sitting on their asses about it. I think I know the reason.

1412
02:02:46,580 --> 02:02:52,580
I don't think they're sitting on their asses about it. I think that it's the more corporate side of it.

1413
02:02:52,580 --> 02:03:02,580
I agree here, and when we say, when we say that Konami is sitting on our ass, please realize, we are talking about the corporate people who make these types of decisions about what is being released in Arcade.

1414
02:03:02,580 --> 02:03:17,580
The people actually making the games, i.e. Konami of Hawaii, is doing an outstanding, incredible, wonderful, I lavish so much praise upon the Ultramix 2 product, it's not even funny.

1415
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:26,580
That is exactly what DDR needed. The unfortunate thing is, because of the corporate end of it, we're not seeing as much of it as we should be.

1416
02:03:26,580 --> 02:03:32,580
It took the fans to get us DDR in the first place. And honestly, we owe a whole lot to Jason Enos for getting it at all.

1417
02:03:32,580 --> 02:03:39,580
Absolutely. Absolutely. In the Groove would not exist. Period. If it wasn't for Jason Enos.

1418
02:03:39,580 --> 02:03:48,580
But like I was saying, I meant the corporate end of it, too. Do you guys remember the whole Konami and the Miro lawsuit from like years ago?

1419
02:03:48,580 --> 02:03:55,580
Oh, of course. It always gets brought up. In discussion of In the Groove legalities, that lawsuit always gets brought up, but yes.

1420
02:03:55,580 --> 02:04:05,580
If I'm not mistaken, it wasn't after everything was said and done, Konami was kind of helping them or something like that, and they were getting some type of royalty or kickback or something like that?

1421
02:04:05,580 --> 02:04:09,500
That's the rumor, but I've heard about five different results of that, and I have yet

1422
02:04:09,500 --> 02:04:13,740
to see anything concrete, or at least it seems like all the different answers have something

1423
02:04:13,740 --> 02:04:15,220
concrete to go with it.

1424
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:19,920
So I'm just, I think we're just going to do what we did last year, and when we talk to

1425
02:04:19,920 --> 02:04:22,020
somebody at Konami, we'll just ask.

1426
02:04:22,020 --> 02:04:24,020
There you go.

1427
02:04:24,020 --> 02:04:25,940
We'll just ask and see what we can find out.

1428
02:04:25,940 --> 02:04:27,340
I'll do it again.

1429
02:04:27,340 --> 02:04:30,340
Not that they'll tell us anything, but hey, we'll ask.

1430
02:04:30,340 --> 02:04:31,700
We have no shame.

1431
02:04:31,700 --> 02:04:34,040
We have no reputation to ruin.

1432
02:04:34,040 --> 02:04:42,040
We are already a disrespected station. We can't even, you know, we can't go any lower than we are already.

1433
02:04:42,040 --> 02:04:43,040
Hey, that works for me.

1434
02:04:43,040 --> 02:04:44,040
Alright.

1435
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:51,040
And my Best Buy store still has leftover red octane pads from the Holiday Rush.

1436
02:04:51,040 --> 02:04:53,040
All the cheap pads just fly off the shelves.

1437
02:04:53,040 --> 02:04:55,040
Does your GameStop need a plug as well?

1438
02:04:55,040 --> 02:04:56,040
No, Best Buy.

1439
02:04:56,040 --> 02:04:59,040
Oh, sorry, Best Buy. Does your Best Buy need a plug as well?

1440
02:04:59,040 --> 02:05:04,040
It's not really because people look at me as a local DDR anime guru.

1441
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:08,040
Every time they buy DDR or whatever, I tell them, get the pads. Get the red octane pads.

1442
02:05:08,040 --> 02:05:10,040
If you want to play, have fun, get the pads.

1443
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:13,040
These pads over here are not even going to last you six months, if that.

1444
02:05:13,040 --> 02:05:14,040
Get the red octanes.

1445
02:05:14,040 --> 02:05:17,040
A hundred bucks, but trust me, they're worth it.

1446
02:05:17,040 --> 02:05:19,040
I agree. I agree.

1447
02:05:19,040 --> 02:05:22,040
All right, bud, we're going to let you go so we can get into some other segments.

1448
02:05:22,040 --> 02:05:25,040
Any other thoughts you wanted to get out, though, before we let you go?

1449
02:05:25,040 --> 02:05:28,040
Stop buying iPods. Please, make my job easier.

1450
02:05:28,040 --> 02:05:35,040
stop buying I I will stop I will be content with the one I have and not buy

1451
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:41,280
anymore how's that it works all right thank you that's all I say thank you a

1452
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:47,120
good night love you guys night one long bye all right we're gonna go ahead and

1453
02:05:47,120 --> 02:05:51,800
close off the skype line there we got to get into the cage match a lot of good

1454
02:05:51,800 --> 02:05:55,920
discussion there I think this is going to be a we're not done with this

1455
02:05:55,920 --> 02:06:00,240
discussion guys that's going to be interesting to see what unfolds. Hence the new icon. Over

1456
02:06:00,240 --> 02:06:06,640
the next couple of weeks. What? Hence the new icon. Oh yeah, on our website. Before

1457
02:06:06,640 --> 02:06:14,200
we get into the cage match, I want to mention Live 365, the site that we stream our station

1458
02:06:14,200 --> 02:06:17,240
through. They're good enough to provide us with the bandwidth so that all you folks can

1459
02:06:17,240 --> 02:06:22,800
listen to Orange Lounge Radio. Live 365 is doing their award ceremony again this year.

1460
02:06:22,800 --> 02:06:25,920
oh god and the nominations are going on right now

1461
02:06:25,920 --> 02:06:28,880
you guys may or may not remember this I was trying to look for the sound file

1462
02:06:28,880 --> 02:06:33,280
of this earlier but I couldn't find it we were nominated for a best of life 365

1463
02:06:33,280 --> 02:06:37,680
award last year in station least likely to hear on amfm radio which is so us

1464
02:06:37,680 --> 02:06:42,000
if you think about it when they caught we went to the ceremony we dressed up

1465
02:06:42,000 --> 02:06:44,560
like pimps and everything we looked damn good

1466
02:06:44,560 --> 02:06:49,040
we I had an orange fuzzy hat on I was wearing the spongebob square pants

1467
02:06:49,040 --> 02:06:54,280
slippers and my Goomba shirt. We were pimps and we walked into that ceremony

1468
02:06:54,280 --> 02:06:58,120
we sat in the back and drank all night we had a good time and then when they

1469
02:06:58,120 --> 02:07:03,240
called us or when they called the category they forgot to mention us our

1470
02:07:03,240 --> 02:07:07,400
name was left off the envelope so they're like and the nominees are the Pokemon

1471
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:12,320
radio channel the porno music channel the whatever stations were up against

1472
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:16,400
and then they left us off and we were like and it's so funny because you can

1473
02:07:16,400 --> 02:07:19,680
hear us in the live stream of the awards, somebody did it, you hear us in the background

1474
02:07:19,680 --> 02:07:25,240
going, hey! And then they're like, oh, oh, and an orange lounge. And we're like, at that

1475
02:07:25,240 --> 02:07:28,640
point we're like, well, shit, we didn't win if they didn't even get, if we didn't even

1476
02:07:28,640 --> 02:07:31,640
get to the envelope. And of course we didn't, we lost in the morning decision.

1477
02:07:31,640 --> 02:07:36,760
And, and, and they had trivia and Rob won this wonderful, um, internet, like, media...

1478
02:07:36,760 --> 02:07:39,840
Oh, I did win that....remote thing that I don't think we've

1479
02:07:39,840 --> 02:07:43,040
actually used. No, it's still in the box. I tried hooking it up, it's like, and my windows

Paranormal Station sucks, you need to listen to, if you're enlisted to Paranormal, listen to, what was that, the AM show that's on, I gotta, I can't remember.

1506
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:04,120
Well, you know why the Paranormal folks didn't go to the awards ceremony?

1507
02:10:05,620 --> 02:10:09,120
They are afraid that the man who's gonna get them told them not to, what?

1508
02:10:09,120 --> 02:10:10,620
They already knew they weren't gonna win.

1509
02:10:15,620 --> 02:10:18,120
Pokemon Radio, what the fuck is Pokemon Radio?

1510
02:10:18,120 --> 02:10:19,120
You know what?

1511
02:10:19,120 --> 02:10:22,120
Is there enough music in that show to be a radio station?

1512
02:10:22,120 --> 02:10:25,120
You best believe it. There is a lot of stuff...

1513
02:10:25,120 --> 02:10:29,120
Pokemon! Gotta catch them all!

1514
02:10:29,120 --> 02:10:36,120
You know, I can't dog on the Pokemon radio station because I've seen the guy posting around the forums and he's actually a pretty nice guy, so...

1515
02:10:36,120 --> 02:10:37,120
Yeah, I...

1516
02:10:37,120 --> 02:10:40,120
That doesn't mean I don't want to beat him!

1517
02:10:40,120 --> 02:10:45,120
No. We're all friends, you know, at the end of the day, but, you know, it's just like...

1518
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:47,120
Who do you love more, people?

1519
02:10:47,120 --> 02:10:52,120
It's like this, okay? When I go and play QZAR, I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

1520
02:10:52,120 --> 02:10:53,120
Do you want-

1521
02:10:53,120 --> 02:10:55,120
At the end of the day, we're friends, but I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

1522
02:10:55,120 --> 02:11:03,120
Seriously, if you don't vote for Orange Lounge Radio, if you don't go and nominate us, you're basically giving Pikachu this award.

1523
02:11:03,120 --> 02:11:07,120
You're supporting terrorism if you do not vote for Orange Lounge Radio.

1524
02:11:07,120 --> 02:11:14,120
Terrorism. I mean, look at what that Pokemon show did to all those poor kids with epilepsy.

1525
02:11:14,120 --> 02:11:18,320
We really shouldn't dog on the Pokemon station. You know what? They probably...

1526
02:11:18,320 --> 02:11:21,360
I would bet you right now they're talking on their station about what a bunch of

1527
02:11:21,360 --> 02:11:24,800
fucking DDR video game nerds over there. What the hell is wrong with them?

1528
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,920
I'm not talking about the radio station, I'm talking about the cartoon. That cartoon sucks.

1529
02:11:27,920 --> 02:11:32,280
Alright. Anyways.

1530
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:35,840
Support internet radio. Just listen to internet radio.

1533
02:11:41,720 --> 02:11:45,960
But while you're there, you know, certainly you can find one category to nominate us in.

1534
02:11:45,960 --> 02:11:46,460
Broadcast right here.

1535
02:11:46,460 --> 02:11:47,800
And listen to a podcast.

1536
02:11:47,800 --> 02:11:48,300
Yes.

1537
02:11:48,840 --> 02:11:50,600
Alright, let's get into the cage match.

1538
02:11:52,380 --> 02:11:58,560
In order to participate in the cage match, you need to be in our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1539

Click on chat, and you will be in the chat room.

1540
02:12:01,460 --> 02:12:05,100
And you can vote, the way the cage match works, we play three songs for you guys,

1541
02:12:05,100 --> 02:12:08,980
a clip of last week's winner, and two new songs for you guys.

1542
02:12:08,980 --> 02:12:12,380
and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1543
02:12:12,380 --> 02:12:15,100
Vomani Music and More program which plays 24 hours a day,

1544
02:12:15,100 --> 02:12:18,620
seven days a week on the station when we're not here. Alright, let's get in with

1545
02:12:18,620 --> 02:12:22,140
three songs. Here's the first one, a clip of last week's winner

1546
02:12:22,140 --> 02:12:25,460
who, by the way, dethroned Freezepop

1547
02:12:25,460 --> 02:12:29,020
and Stakeout, robbing it of the retirement.

1548
02:12:29,020 --> 02:12:32,660
And that was all thanks to the tiebreaker vote from Jamie.

1549
02:12:32,660 --> 02:12:36,500
So this song went in instead. It's The Dignity of Labor

1550
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:43,500
with XRV, the Never Akamix. Here's a clip.

1551
02:13:36,500 --> 02:13:47,700
When high above you angry shells begin to fly And they can beat the stag in your mind

1552
02:13:47,700 --> 02:13:57,700
Into the place where truth and sin collide From far below you revelations fail to die

1553
02:13:57,700 --> 02:14:11,700
If you're looking for a reason I can show you all I see

1554
02:14:11,700 --> 02:14:17,700
The effects of imagination

1555
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:20,700
Imagination

1556
02:14:21,700 --> 02:14:23,700
Discretion

1557
02:14:24,700 --> 02:14:27,700
Reimagination

1558
02:14:27,700 --> 02:14:36,700
Hey, oh, it's all you need

1559
02:14:36,700 --> 02:14:46,700
Hey, oh, it's all you need

1560
02:14:46,700 --> 02:14:49,700
When the waves are generate

1561
02:14:49,700 --> 02:14:54,700
There is no form I cannot penetrate

1562
02:14:54,700 --> 02:15:00,500
If only you could see the pain I feel in you

1563
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:04,000
A mirror to your soul is free

1564
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:07,500
Without a trace of vanity

1565
02:15:07,500 --> 02:15:10,900
I'll share with you the mastery

1566
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:16,900
Reveal your agony with a copy

1567
02:15:16,900 --> 02:15:20,400
Yeah, yeah

1568
02:15:20,400 --> 02:15:26,400
XRV, yeah

1569
02:15:26,400 --> 02:15:29,400
My XRV

1570
02:15:43,400 --> 02:15:48,400
Alright kids, that was a clip of song number one, The Dignity of Labor with XRV.

1571
02:15:48,400 --> 02:15:50,080
last week's winner

1572
02:15:50,080 --> 02:15:54,040
here are two new songs that you're going to hear in their entirety now

1573
02:15:54,040 --> 02:15:55,040
your vote

1574
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:58,480
will determine which one goes into rotation all week long on the station

1575
02:15:58,480 --> 02:15:59,900
here is song number two

1576
02:15:59,900 --> 02:16:01,320
it's my pick

1577
02:16:01,320 --> 02:16:05,840
i'm picking a band called day behavior which you know from ultramix 2 they did

1578
02:16:05,840 --> 02:16:06,800
the song

1579
02:16:06,800 --> 02:16:10,480
uh... last week's winner uh... jamie's asking what song number one was

1580
02:16:10,480 --> 02:16:14,840
last week's winner uh... the uh... dignity of labor with xrv loki's pick

1581
02:16:14,840 --> 02:16:18,200
remember you broke the tie and stole it from freeze pop

1582
02:16:18,200 --> 02:16:21,200
I'm sorry, I had to have cup of lung cookie and freeze pops on her.

1583
02:17:18,200 --> 02:17:23,200
It's a sweet and sour combination

1584
02:17:25,200 --> 02:17:28,200
Sleeping with the enemy

1585
02:17:28,200 --> 02:17:32,200
Congratulation

1586
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:35,200
One for me, falling up with a day

1587
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:39,200
Whatever I say, I'm finally on my way

1588
02:17:39,200 --> 02:17:43,200
One for me, face outside my defeat

1589
02:17:43,200 --> 02:17:47,200
I'm coming to say, I'm finally on my way

1590
02:17:47,200 --> 02:17:58,000
La la la la la la la la Kerry's

1591
02:17:58,000 --> 02:18:02,960
La la la la la la la la la

1592
02:18:03,200 --> 02:18:07,660
Each sudden gate says silently

1593
02:18:07,660 --> 02:18:09,580
The fiction story ecological

1594
02:18:09,580 --> 02:18:09,420
cow

1595
02:18:09,420 --> 02:18:16,420
I'd like to come home in the night and have a room with a few

1596
02:18:16,420 --> 02:18:22,420
The future maker is like bands of fire

1597
02:18:24,420 --> 02:18:31,420
Happily surrender to your faithless desire

1598
02:18:31,420 --> 02:18:35,420
Smile on me, fall in love with the day

1599
02:18:35,420 --> 02:18:40,220
Whatever it takes, we're finally on the low

1600
02:18:40,220 --> 02:18:43,000
Mommy, spend some time by the sea

1601
02:18:43,000 --> 02:18:47,080
Oh call me to say, I'm finally on the low

1602
02:18:47,080 --> 02:18:50,600
Mommy, fall in love with Momth and Abish

02:18:50,600 --> 02:18:54,320
Whatever it takes, we're finally on the low

1604
02:18:54,320 --> 02:18:57,420
Mommy, spend some time by the sea

1605
02:18:57,420 --> 02:19:02,820
Oh call me to say, I'm finally on the low

1606

I'm finally on my way

1621
02:20:10,320 --> 02:20:20,320
Thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next video!

1622
02:20:40,320 --> 02:20:42,680
Bad Opinions, starting off with Dark Sacra.

1623
02:20:42,680 --> 02:20:46,040
It's an okay song, but I don't like her voice.

1624
02:20:46,040 --> 02:20:49,320
So it gets a seven.

1625
02:20:49,320 --> 02:20:52,720
Seven from Jamie. Loki?

1626
02:20:52,720 --> 02:20:57,600
I was saying that it reminded me of the one woman that was singing from Aurora

1627
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,960
in, what was it,

1628
02:21:00,960 --> 02:21:04,160
Ordinary World. It sort of reminded me of that,

1629
02:21:04,160 --> 02:21:09,400
at least voice-wise, but it was okay. I like gay behavior, but

1630
02:21:09,400 --> 02:21:16,400
It's a little too happy for me. I mean, I guess it's okay. I'll give it an 8.

1631
02:21:16,400 --> 02:21:19,400
I was actually expecting you to give it a 0.

1632
02:21:19,400 --> 02:21:29,400
No, I mean, it wasn't freeze-pop annoying. It's okay. I mean, I'm open to new types of music except for freeze-pop.

1633
02:21:29,400 --> 02:21:32,400
I ain't gonna complain. An 8's a pretty good score.

1634
02:21:32,400 --> 02:21:33,400
Alright.

1635
02:21:33,400 --> 02:21:34,400
Arcadian.

1636
02:21:34,400 --> 02:21:40,400
It wasn't bad. I'll probably get tired of it if I have to listen to it several times. I'll give it a 7.

1637
02:22:04,400 --> 02:22:11,400
Alright, let's go on to the third song, brought to us by DarkSakurin. She's going with an old favorite tonight.

1638
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:18,400
I, for a while, was getting really, really annoyed by Hamasaki Ayumi's voice, just because she's very nasal.

1639
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:24,400
But then I remembered how much I like this mix. So, um, I think it's, um, Kanaria?

1640
02:22:24,400 --> 02:22:25,400
Mm-hmm.

1641
02:22:25,400 --> 02:22:30,400
So, um, yeah, that one. And it's one of the, uh, Iro tracks. I think.

1642
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:31,400
Okay.

1643
02:22:31,400 --> 02:22:35,400
Alright, can't go wrong with IU Trance, or can you?

1644
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:37,400
It is IU Trance, I'm sorry.

1645
02:22:37,400 --> 02:22:41,400
I gotta wonder if she has a new IU Trance, it's been a while since number 3.

1646
02:22:41,400 --> 02:22:43,400
There's a thing as high as you really deserve, I think.

1647
02:22:43,400 --> 02:22:44,400
We'll see.

1648
02:22:44,400 --> 02:22:45,400
I'll take CG Japan.

1649
02:22:45,400 --> 02:22:48,400
Alright, well let's see if this is worthy of a cage match win.

1650
02:22:48,400 --> 02:22:53,440
twin, it's Hamasaki Ayumi, or if you pronounce it the other way around, it's Ayumi Hamasaki,

1651
02:22:53,440 --> 02:23:00,440
with Kaneria. Enjoy!

1652
02:26:23,440 --> 02:26:39,440
Song number three, Ayumi Hamasaki, or Hamasaki Ayumi, however you prefer.

1653
02:26:39,440 --> 02:26:41,440
How old are you?

1654
02:26:41,440 --> 02:26:42,440
Umm...

1655
02:26:42,440 --> 02:26:43,440
Jamie.

1656
02:26:43,440 --> 02:26:45,440
I'm getting over my...

1657
02:26:45,440 --> 02:26:47,440
He's like a tramp, too.

1658
02:26:47,440 --> 02:26:49,440
He's a nine.

1659
02:26:49,440 --> 02:26:51,440
A nine from Dark Sakura.

1660
02:26:51,440 --> 02:26:55,440
I think Trance is good. I haven't listened to that in a long time.

1661
02:26:55,440 --> 02:27:01,440
Mainly because I treat my CDs like crap and I throw them behind my seat when I'm done listening to them.

1662
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:04,440
And then I wonder why they're scratched and stuff like that.

1663
02:27:04,440 --> 02:27:12,440
So I give that an 8 because it's not one of my favorite songs on there, but it was still pretty good.

1664
02:27:13,440 --> 02:27:15,440
Alright, sounds good.

1665
02:27:15,440 --> 02:27:17,440
Arcadian, 42.

1666
02:27:17,440 --> 02:27:19,440
That's good, I'll give it an 8.

1667
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:21,440
Angel

1668
02:27:25,100 --> 02:27:29,900
You know what it's been a while since we've had some of you trance and cage match and I think it's about time

1669
02:27:29,900 --> 02:27:34,300
So that's a good one. The only thing I can say about this one that I don't like is that the name?

1670
02:27:34,300 --> 02:27:36,580
I kind of yeah sounds like an STD

1671
02:27:37,200 --> 02:27:38,960
Otherwise, it's a good song

1672
02:27:38,960 --> 02:27:45,640
And also, I give it a nine her voice in that one sounded kind of whiny and actually sounds whiny it goes it goes with

1673
02:27:45,640 --> 02:27:46,640
the trance

1674
02:27:46,640 --> 02:27:48,640
her voice always sounds kind of white

1675
02:27:48,640 --> 02:27:49,640
i don't know it's just like

1676
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:51,640
am above and beyond

1677
02:27:51,640 --> 02:27:53,640
i love that one

1678
02:27:53,640 --> 02:27:55,640
in fact i have that song burned again

1679
02:27:55,640 --> 02:27:57,640
on my latest cd and listen to my car

1680
02:27:57,640 --> 02:27:59,640
am above and beyond again

1681
02:27:59,640 --> 02:28:01,640
cause i love listening to that song

1682
02:28:01,640 --> 02:28:03,640
and then there was the other one

1683
02:28:03,640 --> 02:28:05,640
from monies religious

1684
02:28:05,640 --> 02:28:07,640
that one was pretty good too

1685
02:28:07,640 --> 02:28:09,640
i can't remember the name of it

1686
02:28:09,640 --> 02:28:11,640
that whole cd is sex honestly

1687
02:28:11,640 --> 02:28:13,640
uh you trans one

1688

02:28:34,640 --> 02:28:42,640

So stay tuned to find out the winner. So please vote now

1697
02:29:14,200 --> 02:29:16,080
meantime

1698
02:29:16,080 --> 02:29:20,560
Loki I know there's no point in me asking you this anymore, but you know, I've got to ask

1699
02:29:20,560 --> 02:29:24,440
I feel like we owe it to the listeners. Is there any sim scene news this week?

1700
02:29:26,800 --> 02:29:32,560
There's only one thing think of the top of my head and it's just something that's been going on for a while, but

1701
02:29:33,600 --> 02:29:37,700
It's worth mentioning since you know, all the other websites that had links to them are gone

1702
02:29:37,700 --> 02:30:05,700
Um, on Aaron in Japan there's a forum, I can't remember the thread name for the life of me, something about like the sim files or whatever, the Aaron in Japan sim file thread or whatever, and there's a bunch of links to, um, people that do like sim file sets, you know, sort of like, they had one a while back that was, um, oh god, um, they're like just sets.

1703
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:13,920
For example, they have like DDR Fever or whatever, and stuff like that, DDR Extreme, something,

1704
02:30:13,920 --> 02:30:18,220
but there's a lot of like new sim files on there that you could be listening to and playing

1705
02:30:18,220 --> 02:30:21,960
and stuff, and they're brand new, but the problem is, you know, since, you know, all

1706
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:26,500
those websites went down that like DDR Maniacs and DDR UK that used to link to them, where

1707
02:30:26,500 --> 02:30:31,500
they'd be able to announce that stuff, you know, it's harder to find them now, so check

1708
02:30:31,500 --> 02:30:32,760
that out.

1709
02:30:32,760 --> 02:30:38,160
And once again, you know, my favorite thing to do, at least it used to be back in the

1710
02:30:38,160 --> 02:30:44,200
day when Bomani Sims was still around, is to go just do a simple search for like DDR

1711
02:30:44,200 --> 02:30:49,220
DWI or something, and you'd be surprised, you can find a whole lot of Japanese sim files

1712
02:30:49,220 --> 02:30:53,360
out there that you'll never play before, and they actually turn out to be sometimes better

1713
02:30:53,360 --> 02:30:55,400
than the US stuff.

1714
02:30:55,400 --> 02:31:00,240
Because trust me, I've listened to the newest, you know, Max remixes and stuff, for example

1715
02:31:00,240 --> 02:31:08,040
Rocko's Modern Paranoia and I have to say that it still sucks so I don't know

1716
02:31:08,040 --> 02:31:14,240
just check that stuff out there you can also find stuff I believe that of course

1717
02:31:14,240 --> 02:31:19,440
the DDR UK channel is still open on IRC and I'm sure all your official sim files

1718
02:31:19,440 --> 02:31:26,340
are still there and who knows maybe they even have like the new songs for the new

1719
02:31:26,340 --> 02:31:33,740
Ultramix pack but yeah so just go check those out just do some searching Google

1720
02:31:33,740 --> 02:31:40,700
is your friend all right sounds good this is worth mentioning too because

1721
02:31:40,700 --> 02:31:45,220
it's kind of I don't know it's kind of sim scene related it's it's it's another

1722
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:51,620
DDR game born from I think sim scene the sim scene and that's that neon FM yeah

1723
02:31:51,620 --> 02:31:52,620
Yeah.

1724
02:31:52,620 --> 02:31:53,620
Launched a website this week.

1725
02:31:53,620 --> 02:31:54,620
Yes.

1726
02:31:54,620 --> 02:31:55,620
Uh, that was...

1727
02:31:55,620 --> 02:31:56,980
I think we mentioned it a while back.

1728
02:31:56,980 --> 02:31:57,980
We did, but...

1729
02:31:57,980 --> 02:31:58,980
I did mention it a while back.

1730
02:31:58,980 --> 02:32:03,300
It was, um, in the music production thread on Bamai Style, there was a group, a company

1731
02:32:03,300 --> 02:32:06,660
that was looking for artists to do music for a new dance game.

1732
02:32:06,660 --> 02:32:08,620
That is a new dance game, and...

1733
02:32:08,620 --> 02:32:12,260
But it's, it's, it's relevant again because it's, it's...

1734
02:32:12,260 --> 02:32:16,620
The web, the website launched and everything.

1735
02:32:16,620 --> 02:32:17,620
Um...

1736
02:32:17,620 --> 02:32:18,620
Anyways.

1737
02:32:18,620 --> 02:32:48,580
Um, so there was, yeah for example, um, there was, god uh, there was some of the people from, um, the DWI Palace, um, it's like Dave and DJ Slash I believe were those and they were actually, um, they're listed on there, DJ Potato's on there, Thomas Howard with, uh, what was it, the World's, um, I can't remember what the name was,

1738
02:32:48,580 --> 02:32:51,580
Wasn't there a song called, like, Girl's Butts or something like that in there?

1739
02:32:51,580 --> 02:32:55,580
No, it's not like that, but there's World's, like, Cure or World's something.

1740
02:32:55,580 --> 02:33:00,580
We played it a long-ass time ago, um, on the station, and it sucked.

1741
02:33:00,580 --> 02:33:03,580
And now that that song's gonna be on there, you've also got, um...

1742
02:33:03,580 --> 02:33:07,580
I thought Freezepop with, uh, Stake Out is in it, the song...

1743
02:33:07,580 --> 02:33:14,580
Jazakid is in there, that's kinda cool, and I wanna say that wasn't DM Asura on there, too?

1744
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:15,580
I'm pretty sure he was.

1745
02:33:15,580 --> 02:33:17,580
I think so.

1746
02:33:17,580 --> 02:33:25,080
I heard a rumor, now maybe this is a rumor, I heard a rumor that Ashura was kind of pissed at the In The Groove folks because one of the songs takes a riff from him or something.

1747
02:33:25,080 --> 02:33:42,580
Yes, and it's that one that they actually have the videos for from In The Groove 2, it basically, um, it follows the same pattern as, like, um, well first off it rips off Max, and then you also have, it rips off, uh, Neo Max, you know, with the piano slowdown type of thing.

1748
02:33:42,580 --> 02:34:00,580
Um, so you've got that on there, and he's just kind of pissed off at that. To be honest, I would like to see this Neon FM, or whatever it is, Neon, whatever it is, come out and kick ass. But it looks a little weird, I think, from what I've seen. Isn't it like, uh, it's like five...

1749
02:34:00,580 --> 02:34:07,580
It's a five panel layout, and it's laid out like five key beat mania, which I think is very odd.

1750
02:34:07,580 --> 02:34:13,580
Yeah. So, I don't know.

1751
02:34:13,580 --> 02:34:26,580
But odd in a good way. Like, I want to try it. It seems different. It's a different way to have it laid out, and it sounds like fun. I mean, it's feet mania.

1752
02:34:26,580 --> 02:34:36,580
I don't know if you remember, way back in the day, there was the humongous five-key controller.

1753
02:34:36,580 --> 02:34:39,180
I remember this, didn't somebody do one? Yeah.

1754
02:34:39,180 --> 02:34:43,740
That was a big joke. Didn't we set it up one time at some Bimani party where we

1755
02:34:43,740 --> 02:34:47,860
went into the key config and we changed all the keys for B-Media so we could play it with our feet

1756
02:34:47,860 --> 02:34:52,860
on the dance pad? Yeah. But, um, but no, this was like a joke that was on like

1757
02:34:52,860 --> 02:34:56,140
not, it was like two DDR Freak boards ago.

1758
02:34:56,140 --> 02:34:59,540
A joke that was going around.

1759
02:34:59,540 --> 02:35:04,100
I think back on the green board.

1760
02:35:04,100 --> 02:35:06,100
I think so. I think you're right.

1761
02:35:06,100 --> 02:35:07,100
It's that old.

1762
02:35:07,100 --> 02:35:16,100
But what I can like about this game, and this is interesting because, you know, here we go, I just talked about this whole, you know, In The Groove is invading on DDR face.

1763
02:35:16,100 --> 02:35:22,100
But what I like about this Neon FM, they're going to have to do a new cabinet because it's a new dance layout.

1764
02:35:22,100 --> 02:35:26,100
And it's a new dance layout. The game looks a lot different because of it.

1765
02:35:26,100 --> 02:35:29,100
I'm kind of curious to see what it becomes of this game.

1766
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:36,100
I can appreciate this game over in the group, because it's not trying to be a DDR, it's trying to be a dance game.

1767
02:35:36,100 --> 02:35:45,100
Yeah, I give props to this game. Even though the song list is kinda weird, at least it has freeze-pop, and that's cool. So, I'm cool with this so far.

1768
02:35:45,100 --> 02:35:58,100
Yeah, so I mean, at least they're getting talented people to make the music. No offense to the group people, but I mean, there's a lot of talented, you know, Bomani fan people out there that are making music.

1769
02:35:58,100 --> 02:36:07,100
I think it stands a pretty good chance. The layout's a little weird, but you know, I've got to try it before I can actually pass judgment on it.

1770
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:08,100
We'll see, huh?

1771
02:36:08,100 --> 02:36:19,100
It still looks funky. It kind of reminds me almost like Steppin' Music, but Steppin' Music's more like, you know, Spider Stomp.

1772
02:36:19,100 --> 02:36:23,100
God, Spider Stomp. That game's fun.

1773
02:36:23,100 --> 02:36:29,100
Our first arcade dancing experience. Stepping on those big shiny buttons.

1774
02:36:29,100 --> 02:36:42,100
God, I remember freestyling Spider Stomp at the Vacaville, er, not Vacaville, the Dublin, like, Qsar.

1775
02:36:42,100 --> 02:36:47,100
Because there was no DDR there, so I had to play something.

1776
02:36:47,100 --> 02:36:54,500
Alright, we're gonna go to a break. Uh, when we come back from the break, I'm gonna announce the winner of the Orange Laundromat cage match, and we gotta get into the FUs of the week!

1777
02:36:56,000 --> 02:36:56,800
Gonna be awesome.

1778
02:36:57,400 --> 02:37:07,900
Um, in this break, um, I don't know, how about, um, how about Feelings Won't Fade? I haven't played that song in a while. Since we heard a System F remix, let's hear a song by System SF.

1779
02:37:07,900 --> 02:37:20,900
I fucking hate System SF because they rip off System F. God damn it, that guy, you know, was one of the founders of, like, modern trance nowadays, and it really pisses me off that they rip off his style and his song!

1780
02:37:20,900 --> 02:37:22,900
Well, we're gonna hear this song anyway, because I like this song.

1781
02:37:22,900 --> 02:37:23,900
Okay, fine.

1782
02:37:23,900 --> 02:37:27,100
We'll be back after this with the cage match winner, the FUs of the week, and more!

1783
02:37:27,100 --> 02:37:29,100
We'll be back orange launch radio

1784
02:40:27,100 --> 02:40:34,100
I think you made the world a better place

1785
02:40:34,100 --> 02:40:35,100
Hey!

1786
02:40:35,100 --> 02:40:36,100
Hey!

1787
02:40:36,100 --> 02:40:37,100
Hey!

1788
02:40:37,100 --> 02:40:38,100
Hey!

1789
02:40:38,100 --> 02:40:39,100
Hey!

1790
02:40:39,100 --> 02:41:02,100
Thanks for watching!

1791
02:43:09,100 --> 02:43:11,100
Hey!

1792
02:43:11,100 --> 02:43:13,100
Hey!

1793
02:43:13,100 --> 02:43:15,100
Hey!

1794
02:43:43,100 --> 02:43:53,100
I need your love in every way And I feel this every day

1795
02:43:53,100 --> 02:43:59,100
Cause I have too many tears To fall in love again

1796
02:43:59,100 --> 02:44:03,100
Now I am walking around In this side of the town

1797
02:44:03,100 --> 02:44:08,100
I just can't hide away How can I look in your eyes

1798
02:44:08,100 --> 02:44:12,100
When I feel I could die I have to run away

1799
02:44:12,100 --> 02:44:18,200
Da dee dee dum, da dee dum Ga dee dum, da dee dum

1800
02:44:18,200 --> 02:44:25,320
Na dee dee dum, da dee dum Ga dee dum, da dee dum

1801
02:44:25,320 --> 02:44:30,660
I'm falling in love again

1802
02:44:30,500 --> 02:44:17,160
I'm falling in love again

1803
02:44:37,480 --> 02:44:40,480
I'm falling in love

1804
02:45:10,480 --> 02:45:20,480
Bye bye baby balloon, bye bye baby balloon

1805
02:45:20,480 --> 02:45:28,480
Bitch, get a new song, an open letter from Orange Lounge Radio

1806
02:45:28,480 --> 02:45:36,480
Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and we're gonna get into the cage match, or no, we already did the cage match, we're gonna get into the cage match, Victor!

1807
02:45:36,480 --> 02:45:39,480
Cage match two, woo!

1808
02:45:39,480 --> 02:45:43,480
Yes, it's KageMax2 in a brand new cabinet and a red interface!

1809
02:45:45,480 --> 02:45:46,480
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

1810
02:45:48,480 --> 02:45:49,480
It's now in widescreen, though.

1811
02:45:49,480 --> 02:45:51,480
I'm talking about it till we're red in the face.

1812
02:45:51,480 --> 02:45:52,480
See, that's the thing that I also-

1813
02:45:52,480 --> 02:45:55,480
Yeah, because you scream till you're red in the face, you and Loki.

1814
02:45:55,480 --> 02:46:02,480
That's the thing that's also going to suck about that new cabinet that, um, is going to be put in the groove, too. Widescreen.

1815
02:46:03,480 --> 02:46:06,480
Yay, you know how expensive those widescreens are.

1816
02:46:06,480 --> 02:46:11,480
Alright, Chara wants to know the songs from that break, because I guess there were some good ones in there.

1817
02:46:11,480 --> 02:46:14,480
There were good songs, I guess. There were good songs in there.

1818
02:46:14,480 --> 02:46:16,480
System SF, Feelings Won't Fade, starting it off.

1819
02:46:16,480 --> 02:46:21,480
After that, Midi Head, our buddy Midi Head, with In My Eyes, the Midi Head remix from Ultra Mix 2.

1820
02:46:21,480 --> 02:46:26,480
After that, John Robinson with Kekak, from 2DX Red, that's K-E-C-A-K.

1821
02:46:26,480 --> 02:46:31,480
And lastly, Joga, with Dam Daryam.

1822
02:46:31,480 --> 02:46:32,480
Kit-Kat?

1823
02:46:32,480 --> 02:46:33,480
Kekak!

1824
02:46:33,480 --> 02:46:38,480
Sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball.

1825
02:46:38,480 --> 02:46:43,480
No, a cat coughing up a hairball is this.

1826
02:46:43,480 --> 02:46:48,480
That's right, you would have experience with cats and them coughing up hairballs.

1827
02:46:48,480 --> 02:46:53,480
Anyway.

1828
02:46:53,480 --> 02:46:58,480
Let's hear who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

1829
02:46:58,480 --> 02:47:14,700
We have a new cage match winner, Ayumi Hamasaki, with the STD song, when I say it in my white

1830
02:47:14,700 --> 02:47:20,440
accent, Conorrhea.

1831
02:47:20,440 --> 02:47:24,060
You know they have cream for that.

1832
02:47:24,060 --> 02:47:31,060

1833
02:47:32,140 --> 02:47:39,140
tonight. One vote over song number one. It was a very close Cade match altogether. Alright,

1834
02:47:39,700 --> 02:47:45,180
we are going to get into one of our favorite segments. I know it's one of my favorite segments.

1835
02:47:45,180 --> 02:47:50,200
It's the FUs of the Week, boys and girls. And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these

1836
02:47:50,200 --> 02:47:57,200
these FUs of the week every single week.

1837
02:48:10,480 --> 02:48:15,680
A big SQ to my immune system for being a bitch.

1838
02:48:15,680 --> 02:48:16,980
Um...

1839
02:48:16,980 --> 02:48:20,020
Yeah, the virus lingered.

1840
02:48:20,020 --> 02:48:24,720
I was feeling kind of icky poo last week, but not as bad as I was before it was hanging

1841
02:48:24,720 --> 02:48:25,720
on.

1842
02:48:25,720 --> 02:48:29,520
And then I thought my allergies were kicking up, I was like, oh great, I get over running

1843
02:48:29,520 --> 02:48:36,560
103 fever to, you know, having the allergies flare up, then to have it settle into a cough

1844
02:48:36,560 --> 02:48:44,480
on Friday, and then having this doctor, one of the weekend doctors at Kaiser who saw me

1845
02:48:44,480 --> 02:48:49,880

1850
02:49:17,540 --> 02:49:23,620
point where I've woken up, I wake up sometimes in the morning choking and

1851
02:49:23,620 --> 02:49:28,380
then having major chest pains it feels like I've got asthma actually what it

the way that your chest feels that's how I feel all the time a big f you goes to

1855
02:49:44,860 --> 02:49:49,240
having my voice go in and out by tomorrow I'm sure I won't have one which

1856
02:49:49,240 --> 02:49:58,820
is good because if people try to talk to me I just go, I can't talk, bye, really you know a big

1857
02:49:58,820 --> 02:50:04,300
F you to situations I can't do crap about as much as I would like to and

02:50:04,300 --> 02:50:13,580
then an F you to to the person who is still getting me on the way here I

1859
02:50:13,580 --> 02:50:18,580
I really felt like throwing all my brakes, but my car's in bad enough shape as it is.

1860
02:50:18,580 --> 02:50:20,580
And F.U. to the hot coming.

1861
02:50:20,580 --> 02:50:27,580
I was, you know, thinking it was pretty cool that it was all wintery and, you know, the temperature was nice outside.

1862
02:50:27,580 --> 02:50:32,580
And then it gets, like, warm. It's supposed to be 74 degrees tomorrow.

1863
02:50:32,580 --> 02:50:38,580
Fuck that. I want it to stay in the 50s. I want it cold, because my AC doesn't work.

1864
02:50:38,580 --> 02:50:40,580
That's it.

1865
02:50:40,580 --> 02:50:46,580
Oh yeah? And F you to Jinpachi Mishima for being a tough ass bastard to beat.

1866
02:51:10,580 --> 02:51:17,580
now forbids it. Because I'm meddling. Aww, no more portal to hell? And we find out what

1867
02:51:17,780 --> 02:51:23,020
happens to people who meddle, they get their bones broken in their entire body, and then

1868
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:30,020
thrown off a building by three evil spirits. Oh, gave away the end. Damn. Okay. Anyways,

1869
02:51:30,020 --> 02:51:41,220
and um, then fuck you to um, the guy game. Why? Because the guy game for some reason freezes

1870
02:51:41,220 --> 02:51:45,900
up whenever I try to do tier 3 and now I can't progress any further and unlock any other

1871
02:51:45,900 --> 02:51:51,740
women or see more boobies because I'm stuck now because it will not load tier 3. God damn

1872
02:51:51,740 --> 02:51:57,900
it, that sucks. Did you ever think maybe that could be remedied by buying a legit copy of

1873
02:51:57,900 --> 02:52:02,040
the game oh too bad they don't tell it oh well damn no what I'm gonna do is I'm

1874
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:05,040
gonna find a save file for it that's everything unlocked and then I'll just

1875
02:52:05,040 --> 02:52:14,280
build bypass all that and then also fuck you to this woman we spoke to at the

1876
02:52:14,280 --> 02:52:17,840
hazelwood apartment she was talking to us like that we were

1877
02:52:17,840 --> 02:52:27,880
retarded, talking very slowly, and in a southern accent, and I just wanted to smack her. I'm

1878
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:41,760
so busy right now. Fucking hate him. And finally, fuck you to the reanimated head of Walt Disney

1879
02:52:41,760 --> 02:52:48,760
for eating all those Cuban children. What did they ever do to you?

1880
02:52:49,360 --> 02:52:56,360
Okay, I guess it's my turn.

1881
02:52:58,280 --> 02:53:01,920
Eff you to the fact that I'm so sore today because I slept on that mattress,

1882
02:53:01,920 --> 02:53:05,980
or that fold-out bed last night. I should have just let the two guys who wanted to

1883
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:08,280
make out all night long sleep on the

1884
02:53:08,280 --> 02:53:12,040
things they could have that and I should have taken a nice fluffy mattress that

1885
02:53:12,040 --> 02:53:14,000
was on the ground but I was kinda stupid

1886
02:53:14,000 --> 02:53:18,040
and I just took the first comfy thing that looked available but I'm very

1887
02:53:18,040 --> 02:53:21,920
thankful to the person who let us stay there so I can't really bitch too much but F you to

1888
02:53:21,920 --> 02:53:26,280
pain it hurts it hurts so bad

1889
02:53:26,280 --> 02:53:30,080
but thank you to drugs because I'm taking

1890
02:53:30,080 --> 02:53:34,080
Tylenol to help make the pain go away so I'm very thankful to that

1891
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:39,080
F you to the guy wearing the shirt that said they were against gay fraternities.

1892
02:53:39,080 --> 02:53:42,080
What did gay fraternities ever do to you?

1893
02:53:42,080 --> 02:53:47,080
Did they... I don't... I don't even want to know what they... just don't even...

1894
02:53:47,080 --> 02:53:51,080
Let people do what they want. God, get your nose out of their business.

1895
02:53:51,080 --> 02:53:55,080
Um, and then, um...

1896
02:53:55,080 --> 02:54:00,080
An F you to the fact that, um...

1897
02:54:00,080 --> 02:54:03,080
I also want ice cream, but I'm just too lazy to go get it.

1898
02:54:04,080 --> 02:54:06,080
Ooh, I might- okay, cool.

1899
02:54:09,080 --> 02:54:10,080
Alright.

1900
02:54:11,080 --> 02:54:19,080
That's it for my FUs. We'll be back, uh, with the chatroom FUs right after we get to Angel and Arcadian's FUs.

1901
02:54:20,080 --> 02:54:21,080
Let's start with Angel.

1902
02:54:22,080 --> 02:54:29,080
I've been to myself for having, like, this weird-ass dream last night and, like, waking myself up, uh, three hours after I went to bed.

1903
02:54:29,080 --> 02:54:36,080
And then I had to like, I don't know, calm myself back down and go back over and go to bed. That was just fucked up.

1904
02:54:36,080 --> 02:54:44,080
Um, I have to thank myself again for realizing that, oh, I need to update my video drivers for Final Fantasy VII.

1905
02:54:44,080 --> 02:54:48,080
But that's okay because I need to reinstall the damn thing anyway now.

1906
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:54,080
So that kind of sucks. Um, other than that, nothing else really.

1907
02:54:54,080 --> 02:54:59,080
I'm pretty boring, as usual, and yeah, you don't need to hear me anymore. Goodbye!

1908
02:55:03,080 --> 02:55:10,080
Fuck you to the creeping, broke crud that I've had just now going away after several weeks.

1909
02:55:13,080 --> 02:55:20,080
Fuck you to Shostakovich being so far away. It was necessitating a two-hour drive up the mountain that I did today.

1910
02:55:20,080 --> 02:55:27,080
I got to see some mysterious white substance that was on the ground in many places.

1911
02:55:27,080 --> 02:55:29,080
Uh, that was...

1912
02:55:29,080 --> 02:55:34,080
Oh yes, there was crack all over the ground, changing the sky.

1913
02:55:34,080 --> 02:55:36,080
Yay, crack from the sky.

1914
02:55:36,080 --> 02:55:38,080
It's God's crack.

1915
02:55:38,080 --> 02:55:43,080
And then, fuck you to car lights at night, like, blinding me,

1916
02:55:43,080 --> 02:55:49,080
and my fucking windows were always getting all crud on them, blinding me and all that kind of shit.

1917
02:55:49,080 --> 02:55:55,880
Jamie made a funny don't don't pay attention or you think that God has dermatitis of the ass

1918
02:55:58,760 --> 02:56:02,120
Just don't listen don't listen to us Arcadian, I'm sorry

1919
02:56:05,400 --> 02:56:07,120
All right

1920
02:56:07,120 --> 02:56:09,720
one more real quick fuck you to

1921
02:56:10,440 --> 02:56:15,680
Explicit for not picking up his yes. We do have a policy that if it's not picked up within a month it becomes ours

1922
02:56:15,680 --> 02:56:27,040
dark knight

1923
02:56:27,040 --> 02:56:30,200
would like jamie to know that jim pachi is a hard ass bastard

1924
02:56:30,200 --> 02:56:31,700

1925
02:56:31,700 --> 02:56:32,700

1926
02:56:32,700 --> 02:56:33,700
i hate him

1927
02:56:33,700 --> 02:56:34,860
dark knight also says

1928
02:56:34,860 --> 02:56:36,960
that's not a nice thing to say to dark knight

1929
02:56:36,960 --> 02:56:37,960
dark knight's a nice guy

1930
02:56:37,960 --> 02:56:39,120
no i like dark knight

1931
02:56:39,120 --> 02:56:41,120
dark knight's my buddy

1932
02:56:41,120 --> 02:56:42,640
i'm talking about jim pachi

1933
02:56:42,640 --> 02:56:43,640
with his

1934
02:56:43,640 --> 02:56:44,640
with his

1935
02:56:44,640 --> 02:56:46,640
You know why the mouth is on his stomach?

1936
02:56:46,640 --> 02:56:48,640
It's his cheap-ass fireball, isn't it? I fucking hate that.

1937
02:56:48,640 --> 02:56:50,640
You know why the mouth is on his stomach?

1938
02:56:50,640 --> 02:56:52,640
His mouth is on his stomach.

1939
02:56:52,640 --> 02:56:54,640
Because your soul is stored in your belly.

1940
02:56:54,640 --> 02:56:56,640
I've got a lot of soul in me, then.

1941
02:56:56,640 --> 02:56:58,640
Remember Bishamon and Darkstalkers?

1942
02:56:58,640 --> 02:57:00,640
He was like that, too.

1943
02:57:00,640 --> 02:57:02,640
I need to lose some soul, if that's the case.

1944
02:57:02,640 --> 02:57:06,640
But he's possessed, so the possession is on his tummy.

1945
02:57:06,640 --> 02:57:08,640
Like Bishamon and Darkstalkers.

1946
02:57:08,640 --> 02:57:12,640
Sure, he just didn't have, like, a really bad taco or anything in, like, Taco Bell.

1947
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:15,640
And sometimes my stomach feels like that after a night at Taco Bell.

1948
02:57:15,640 --> 02:57:18,880
He ate it, Jim Boys.

1949
02:57:18,880 --> 02:57:21,580
It's like my stomach suddenly becomes the grudge.

1950
02:57:21,580 --> 02:57:24,960
Ahhhh.

1951
02:57:24,960 --> 02:57:26,120
Alright, Dark Knight says,

1952
02:57:26,120 --> 02:57:30,440
F you to the many evil corporations in the US that treat its employees like s***.

1953
02:57:30,440 --> 02:57:34,440
Quote the raven. Nevermore.

1954
02:57:34,440 --> 02:57:38,640
Dork says, F you to this damn bitch at work for saying she'll get me fired.

1955
02:57:38,640 --> 02:57:40,740
One, I could give a s*** if I lose this job or not.

1956
02:57:40,740 --> 02:57:44,620
And two, why the fuck are you gonna complain to my boss about me telling you the truth?

1957
02:57:44,620 --> 02:57:47,260
If you can't handle the truth, don't fucking ask.

1958
02:57:47,260 --> 02:57:49,180
And again, F you to girls.

1959
02:57:49,180 --> 02:57:52,860
Yeah, well F you back, buddy.

1960
02:57:52,860 --> 02:57:54,220
I'm kidding.

1961
02:57:54,220 --> 02:57:58,000
Asian buddy Paul says, F you to my Spanish 3 class.

1962
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:01,800
If I do any more Spanish, I'll no longer be allowed to check the Asian Pacific Islander

1963
02:58:01,800 --> 02:58:06,420
box on applications.

1964
02:58:06,420 --> 02:58:09,740
Vandalus says, F you to California's real estate prices.

1965
02:58:09,740 --> 02:58:10,860
Oh God, yes.

1966
02:58:10,860 --> 02:58:12,620
And F you to Nashville for showing me

1967
02:58:12,620 --> 02:58:14,120
that a lavish house in acreage

1968
02:58:14,120 --> 02:58:16,040
doesn't have to cost over 700K.

1969
02:58:17,500 --> 02:58:18,500
I feel sad.

1970
02:58:20,780 --> 02:58:23,500
Big Super SSJ 100 F you.

1971
02:58:23,500 --> 02:58:25,420
This is coming from SSJ 100 Matt.

1972
02:58:25,420 --> 02:58:28,580
To Destination TV for screwing me out of an internship

1973
02:58:28,580 --> 02:58:30,260
and trying to use me to steal equipment

1974
02:58:30,260 --> 02:58:33,020
from my film school and using me for slave labor.

1975
02:58:33,020 --> 02:58:35,560
F you to Mesa Golf Land, BeatMania 2DX players

1976
02:58:35,560 --> 02:58:39,760
Danbury, Connecticut DDR players for being hissy fit people who don't like people lesser

1977
02:58:39,760 --> 02:58:41,160
than them.

1978
02:58:41,160 --> 02:58:44,160
That's quite a big scope of the country there.

1979
02:58:44,160 --> 02:58:48,940
Sephiroth1215 says, F you to the stupid people who think they are so good at DDR because

1980
02:58:48,940 --> 02:58:54,480
they can do 1 10 even though all they can play on 1.5 and they won't let anyone they

1981
02:58:54,480 --> 02:58:59,140
don't know play.

1982
02:58:59,140 --> 02:59:05,480
You know if you can beat bag on 3 speed that's really only like a 9 that's not a 10.

1983
02:59:05,480 --> 02:59:09,480
DJ Rom S says F you to people who don't know how to use iPods

1984
02:59:09,480 --> 02:59:14,480
RTFM read the fucking manual first before you return the pod you ass

1985
02:59:14,480 --> 02:59:19,480
And F you to Best Buy for not giving recognition to us grunts in the Geek Squad

1986
02:59:19,480 --> 02:59:22,480
We fix computers, check TVs, do customer service

1987
02:59:22,480 --> 02:59:23,480
We want some props too

1988
02:59:23,480 --> 02:59:29,480
Ugh, you know I saw, actually I was driving down the road the other day and I saw one of those Geek Squad cars

1989
02:59:29,480 --> 02:59:32,480
And that just made me laugh, I'm like that's such a sitcom waiting to happen

1990
02:59:32,480 --> 02:59:48,040
happen? What's sad enough is I'd be doing that if I was actually accredited. Okay, I

1991
02:59:48,040 --> 02:59:53,480
think I only got like half of Illusions. Buffett was like, my friend and I go to IHOP anyway,

1992
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:57,000
half an hour late, my friend isn't there, I call my friend and he says to my friend

1993
02:59:57,000 --> 03:00:01,140
Esteban, we're gonna be coming back to IHOP so we just eat at IHOP and wait for him. We

1994
03:00:01,140 --> 03:00:04,980
We eat our meals and after the meal my coupon doesn't work, the coupon giving me a free

1995
03:00:04,980 --> 03:00:06,860
meal because I bought appetizers.

1996
03:00:06,860 --> 03:00:09,540
I didn't bring that much money so I'm totally scrounging for change.

1997
03:00:09,540 --> 03:00:10,960
There goes most of my money.

1998
03:00:10,960 --> 03:00:14,700
We walk to Shakey's and this crazy guy comes off the freeway, scares us and we run for

1999
03:00:14,700 --> 03:00:17,300
our lives as he chases after us.

2000
03:00:17,300 --> 03:00:21,260
We get to Shakey's and after all that crap I find that they had just taken the DDR machine

2001
03:00:21,260 --> 03:00:25,560
out and my friend had waited around for us an hour and a half, thus making it the worst

2002
03:00:25,560 --> 03:00:30,940
weekend ever.

2003
03:00:30,940 --> 03:00:35,860
you get a job and work full-time then every weekend's the worst weekend ever

2004
03:00:35,860 --> 03:00:40,540
now okay our RPG King 7 says f you to being unemployed it really sucks and

2005
03:00:40,540 --> 03:00:44,660
I've tried everywhere in my town in the next two towns over and no jobs

2006
03:00:44,660 --> 03:00:51,980
unemployment sucks John Field says f you to my grandfather dying crying f you to

2007
03:00:51,980 --> 03:00:55,700
my laziness this week when I have a paper due this Tuesday that grandfather

2008
03:00:55,700 --> 03:01:01,780
F.U. goes to cancer. Sorry to hear about it, but hope things are okay. And that's it, that

2009
03:01:01,780 --> 03:01:09,020
was the last F.U. Thank you to the chat room for playing along with the F.U.s of the week.

2010
03:01:09,020 --> 03:01:12,580
That's always fun. Alright, we're going to do a quick two-song break, then we're going

2011
03:01:12,580 --> 03:01:17,520
to come back to wrap stuff up here on Orange Lounge Radio. In this break, I'm liking the

2012
03:01:17,520 --> 03:01:22,580
UltraMix 2 thing, so we're going to do a song from UltraMix 2, and maybe an older one from

2013
03:01:22,580 --> 03:01:29,460
from Ultramix One. How's that sound? So we will be back after this. I just have to figure

2014
03:01:29,460 --> 03:01:37,140
out what song we're going to do first. When we come back, we're going to wrap it up, tell

2015
03:01:37,140 --> 03:01:42,140
you guys what to look forward to next week, and all that fun stuff. However, I have to

2016
03:01:42,140 --> 03:01:47,420
be able to successfully navigate my computer before we can get to a break. I'm a folder

2017
03:01:47,420 --> 03:01:53,940
challenge tonight apparently. Rob loses at the computer. I totally lose. Let's do, let's

2018
03:01:53,940 --> 03:02:00,940
do a max remix because we haven't done one of those in a while. We'll be back after this.

2019
03:04:23,940 --> 03:04:28,940
Do you ever question your life?

2020
03:04:30,940 --> 03:04:34,940
Do you ever wonder why?

2021
03:04:37,940 --> 03:04:42,940
Do you ever see in your dreams?

2022
03:04:44,940 --> 03:04:47,940
Oh, the candle in the sky

2023
03:04:48,940 --> 03:04:51,940
Oh, tell me why

2024
03:04:51,940 --> 03:04:58,940
Do we build castles in the sky or tell me why?

2025
03:04:58,940 --> 03:05:05,940
All the castles way up high, please tell me why

2026
03:05:05,940 --> 03:05:12,940
Do we build castles in the sky or tell me why?

2027
03:05:12,940 --> 03:05:17,940
All the castle's way up high

2028
03:05:17,940 --> 03:05:43,060
So that's why the orange patch, this TDR sucks!

2029
03:05:43,060 --> 03:05:44,060
Holla!

2030
03:05:44,060 --> 03:05:56,940
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, and you know what? It's about time to wrap stuff up.

2031
03:05:56,940 --> 03:05:58,300
I can't believe it already.

2032
03:05:58,300 --> 03:06:00,140
They need to come back on the show.

2033
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:03,380
I know. We need to get some more guests on the show. We're gonna have to go around. You

2034
03:06:03,380 --> 03:06:06,980
know, there's some fun stuff coming up that you can be expecting soon here on Orange Lounge

2035
03:06:06,980 --> 03:06:12,140
Radio. Oh, excuse me. There's a big tournament, the March Madness tournament coming up, and

2036
03:06:12,140 --> 03:06:14,820
And I haven't been to a DDR tournament in a while, so definitely I'm going to check

2037
03:06:14,820 --> 03:06:15,820
that out.

2038
03:06:15,820 --> 03:06:17,980
That's going on in the Bay Area, so look for us there.

2039
03:06:17,980 --> 03:06:24,260
And also, Wreck-a-Con, I'm going to try and make it out there if I can, because I do want

2040
03:06:24,260 --> 03:06:27,660
to support that, so we'll be out there, hopefully.

2041
03:06:27,660 --> 03:06:29,500
That happens in, what, two weeks, Angel?

2042
03:06:29,500 --> 03:06:30,500
Two weeks.

2043
03:06:30,500 --> 03:06:32,700
So I'm going to try and be out there, and, um...

2044
03:06:32,700 --> 03:06:34,780
I'll cosplay if I can get a purple wig and duct tape.

2045
03:06:34,780 --> 03:06:36,780
What are you going to cosplay as?

2046
03:06:36,780 --> 03:06:37,780
Biking.

2047
03:06:37,780 --> 03:06:39,580
I need a purple wig and duct tape.

2048
03:06:39,580 --> 03:06:41,420
I want to cosplay as something, but it has to be easy.

2049
03:06:41,420 --> 03:06:45,100
I want to cosplay, if I were to cosplay at all,

2050
03:06:45,100 --> 03:06:49,100
Dr. Cube. Oh, that would rock!

2051
03:06:49,100 --> 03:06:53,180
It would so rock! Maybe. I actually found my Jill costume.

2052
03:06:53,180 --> 03:06:58,660
But my, um, one of my costumes is now retired because it is

2053
03:06:58,660 --> 03:07:02,660
four sizes too big. Wow, well hey,

2054
03:07:02,660 --> 03:07:06,700
that's the best reason to retire something. Although I do still have my Emmy costume.

2055
03:07:06,700 --> 03:07:10,860
Here you go. I have the wig, I have everything. I should cosplay as Pantsless Rage.

2056
03:07:10,860 --> 03:07:16,860
You know, I just, I had a vest for a rage costume and I just threw it out.

2057
03:07:16,860 --> 03:07:17,860
Aww, that's right.

2058
03:07:17,860 --> 03:07:19,860
It would have hit you.

2059
03:07:19,860 --> 03:07:20,860
Oh well.

2060
03:07:20,860 --> 03:07:24,860
Um, anyway, so we got that coming up in future weeks on the show.

2061
03:07:24,860 --> 03:07:28,860
Don't forget to check out our podcast, www.orangewise.com, click on podcasts.

2062
03:07:28,860 --> 03:07:31,860
It's us talking about other types of games, not just the Bomani games.

2063
03:07:31,860 --> 03:07:32,860
It's pretty cool.

2064
03:07:32,860 --> 03:07:35,860
And what's very interesting is that we thought we were going to be famous

2065
03:07:35,860 --> 03:07:39,860
because we actually got contacted by a reporter for a pretty big newspaper in the area.

2066
03:07:39,860 --> 03:07:44,620
in the area about the podcast but we haven't heard anything back so I'm

2067
03:07:44,620 --> 03:07:48,740
hoping that's still gonna happen but we're not sure now so keep your fingers

2068
03:07:48,740 --> 03:07:53,980
crossed for us guys I'm sure they're busy with other things I know war going on and

2069
03:07:53,980 --> 03:07:58,460
you know things like that so oh well so keep supporting our podcast our

2070
03:07:58,460 --> 03:08:01,260
podcast has been doing very well we're very happy about that so that's gonna

2071
03:08:01,260 --> 03:08:03,980
continue to grow and just be something else here at orange I wanted to go to

2072
03:08:03,980 --> 03:08:10,860
to like, Phantom of Khan, but it's so close to E3. It's like, I think that like, you know,

2073
03:08:10,860 --> 03:08:15,060
previous, you know, two years ago is like the last time that I've gone, and I think

2074
03:08:15,060 --> 03:08:18,060
that's probably the last time I will go. I still want to go pretty bad too, even. I found

2075
03:08:18,060 --> 03:08:21,500
my photos from front of me. Even though E3 is right there, I still want to go. The only

2076
03:08:21,500 --> 03:08:29,780
reason that I go to those things anymore is just Studio sudoke. I fucking love Redeath,

2077
03:08:29,780 --> 03:08:36,780
Fanboy Bebop and Nescaflownate, that is the reason why I go to Fanime right there, so.

2078
03:08:36,780 --> 03:08:44,340
But it'd be fun. And besides, the dealer's room calls to me, and, that calls to my wallet,

2079
03:08:44,340 --> 03:08:50,540
and, it, you know, I buy Gundam models there every time and I still have three that I haven't

2080
03:08:50,540 --> 03:08:56,260
built yet, and I really, you know, I can't afford it.

2081
03:08:56,260 --> 03:09:02,260
Alright, we gotta wrap it up, guys. It's time to go around and get everybody's final thought, starting off with Angel.

2082
03:09:02,260 --> 03:09:07,260
Damn this level on WarioWare Touched. Final Fantasy? Wait, what the hell was I trying to say there?

2083
03:09:07,260 --> 03:09:11,260
Addict Arcadian. Final thought.

2084
03:09:11,260 --> 03:09:14,260
It's good to see the mountains again.

2085
03:09:14,260 --> 03:09:16,260
Loki, your final thought.

2086
03:09:16,260 --> 03:09:23,260
I'm tired, and god damn it, that bag of gummy bears is gonna be gone... pretty soon.

2087
03:09:53,260 --> 03:09:55,260
Ooh, we gotta do that again!

2088
03:09:55,260 --> 03:09:58,260
Check that out, but there are, I think there's pictures from the Peep Joust.

2089
03:09:58,260 --> 03:10:05,260
Um, not only on OrangeOnsRadio.com, but I know that Rice Princess put some in the new Orange Ons Radio Club at OneJoust2.

2090
03:10:05,260 --> 03:10:06,260
Coming soon!

2091
03:10:06,260 --> 03:10:07,260
Peep Joust 2!

2092
03:10:07,260 --> 03:10:12,260
And this time, it's all about, we're gonna get the Peeps and the bunnies and everything.

2093
03:10:12,260 --> 03:10:13,260
Ooh.

2094
03:10:13,260 --> 03:10:15,260
You know what I could do, maybe, Rob?

2095
03:10:15,260 --> 03:10:16,260
What?

2096
03:10:16,260 --> 03:10:21,260
We could maybe hook this up to where we could set it up, where we could take the webcam and record it.

2097
03:10:21,260 --> 03:10:22,260
That'd be awesome.

2098
03:10:22,260 --> 03:10:24,260
And get like a video clip of it.

2099
03:10:24,260 --> 03:10:25,260
Awesome.

2100
03:10:25,260 --> 03:10:27,740
Coming soon to Orange Lounge Radio.

2101
03:10:27,740 --> 03:10:30,540
Last word of tonight's show.

2102
03:10:30,540 --> 03:10:31,820
Dark Sacra, why not?

2103
03:10:31,820 --> 03:10:33,380

Look into these eyes, then you'll see the size of these flames

2113

Dwelling on the past, past, burning up my brain, hot

2114
03:11:21,140 --> 03:11:24,140
Everyone that burns has to learn from the pain

2115
03:11:24,140 --> 03:11:28,140
Hey, I think about the day my girlie ran away with my pay

Give me somethin' to praise!

2124
03:11:55,140 --> 03:12:10,140
It's just one of those days when you don't wanna wake up

2125
03:12:10,140 --> 03:12:18,140
Everything is fucked, everybody sucks You don't really know why, but you wanna justify

03:12:18,140 --> 03:12:24,140
And if you're stuck up, you just worked up Next in line to get fucked up

2127
03:12:24,140 --> 03:12:27,640
Your best bet is to stay away, motherfucker

03:12:27,640 --> 03:12:30,140
It's just one of those days

2129
03:12:30,140 --> 03:12:35,640
It's all about the he says, she says, oh shit

2130
03:12:35,640 --> 03:12:40,640
I think you better quit letting shit slip

2131
03:12:40,640 --> 03:12:47,140
Or you'll be leaving the station with a bad lip

2132
03:12:47,140 --> 03:12:51,640

2133
03:12:51,640 --> 03:12:53,640
So come and get it

I feel like shit, huh?

2135
03:12:56,640 --> 03:12:59,640
My suggestion is to keep your distance

2136
03:12:59,640 --> 03:13:04,640
Cause right now, I'm dangerous

2137
03:13:04,640 --> 03:13:07,640
We've all felt like shit and been treated like shit, right ladies and gentlemen?

2138
03:13:07,640 --> 03:13:11,640
All those motherfuckers, they wanna step up

2139
03:13:11,640 --> 03:13:13,640
I hope you know

2140
03:13:13,640 --> 03:13:16,640
I pack a chainsaw

2141
03:13:16,640 --> 03:13:19,640
I'll skin your ass raw

2142
03:13:19,640 --> 03:13:21,640
And if my day keeps going this way

2143
03:13:21,640 --> 03:13:24,640
I just might break your fuckin' face tonight!

2144
03:13:24,640 --> 03:13:28,640
Blue Fisk and Doo-Doo, won't you take me home?

2145
03:13:28,640 --> 03:13:41,320
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2146
03:13:58,640 --> 03:14:20,760
So long, farewell.
