13:00.719 --> 13:01.839
[SPEAKER_20]: No, cooking rice.

13:01.979 --> 13:02.879
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay, whatever.

13:02.899 --> 13:05.660
[SPEAKER_21]: Not cooking... I want cookies.

13:07.220 --> 13:10.101
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm sorry, cookies weren't on the agenda.

13:10.461 --> 13:10.761
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn.

13:12.233 --> 13:15.154
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, actually, no, I have Girl Scout cookies, so all is well.

13:15.174 --> 13:17.315
[SPEAKER_21]: Girl Scout cookies are fucking evil, okay?

13:17.335 --> 13:18.235
[SPEAKER_20]: Girl Scout cookies are not evil.

13:18.255 --> 13:19.175
[SPEAKER_21]: Girl Scouts are evil.

13:19.575 --> 13:21.096
[SPEAKER_21]: Girl Scouts are not evil.

13:21.196 --> 13:21.796
[SPEAKER_21]: They are, too.

13:21.856 --> 13:24.997
[SPEAKER_21]: They fucking harass me when I try to go shop for groceries.

13:25.217 --> 13:28.178
[SPEAKER_21]: We want your money for really shitty cookies.

13:28.258 --> 13:29.978
[SPEAKER_21]: Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.

13:30.258 --> 13:32.139
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm just like, stay away, bitch.

13:32.679 --> 13:33.399
[SPEAKER_21]: I will hurt you.

13:33.860 --> 13:41.482
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an entire box of Samoas locked in my drawer at work, and they will be consumed on my next cheat day, the entire box.

13:44.068 --> 13:47.912
[SPEAKER_20]: I've already torn through about half a box today, so I'm quite proud of myself.

13:48.873 --> 13:49.714
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I can get you a cookie.

13:49.734 --> 13:52.556
[SPEAKER_07]: I've had few enough carbs so that I can afford a cookie.

13:53.397 --> 13:53.818
[SPEAKER_20]: A cookie.

13:53.838 --> 13:54.238
[SPEAKER_07]: A cookie.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.841
[SPEAKER_20]: Girl Scouts are not evil.

13:57.141 --> 13:59.243
[SPEAKER_20]: The parents of Girl Scouts are possibly evil.

13:59.463 --> 14:04.388
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got, well, I'd say approximately about four and a half pounds of gummy bears left.

14:06.372 --> 14:10.116
[SPEAKER_20]: That is a big ass bag of gummy bears.

14:10.236 --> 14:14.600
[SPEAKER_21]: One time I left them in my car and the whole thing melted, like the bottom half.

14:14.620 --> 14:18.863
[SPEAKER_21]: That was cool because it was like eating a gummy, like a giant gummy, I don't know.

14:18.924 --> 14:20.125
[SPEAKER_21]: It was a gummy Godzilla!

14:20.385 --> 14:23.007
[SPEAKER_21]: Like a gummy breast implant or something.

14:27.872 --> 14:30.954
[SPEAKER_20]: Wouldn't it be great if they actually made breast implants out of gummy material?

14:31.675 --> 14:32.115
No.

14:32.436 --> 14:32.636
[SPEAKER_20]: No.

14:36.131 --> 14:42.675
[SPEAKER_21]: Although they would smell nice and fruity.

14:43.436 --> 14:47.019
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's finish up the intros here so we can get to a break here and then start the real show.

14:48.160 --> 14:50.361
[SPEAKER_20]: Also joining us, say hello to DDR Angel.

14:51.522 --> 14:51.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

14:53.884 --> 14:56.406
[SPEAKER_06]: I missed one week and I missed comments like that.

14:57.426 --> 14:59.628
[SPEAKER_20]: Be gummy implant free, DDR Angel, by the way.

14:59.648 --> 15:00.489
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

15:00.569 --> 15:00.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Indeed.

15:02.625 --> 15:05.027
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what the greatest news though that I've heard all week?

15:05.047 --> 15:05.907
[SPEAKER_20]: Voltron got served.

15:34.858 --> 15:39.606
[SPEAKER_20]: All this and more when we come back from this break featuring some Beatmania songs.

20:58.553 --> 21:00.935
[SPEAKER_20]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

21:01.595 --> 21:04.277
[SPEAKER_20]: Tonight's going to be a very interesting show because...

21:05.009 --> 21:08.551
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

21:22.819 --> 21:24.300
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop what you're thinking, perverts.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.321
[SPEAKER_20]: It wasn't anything like that.

21:25.361 --> 21:27.522
[SPEAKER_20]: I was out of town last night, so I was staying at a friend's house.

21:28.263 --> 21:35.668
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know that weird feeling you have when you come back the next day and you weren't sleeping in your own bed the night before?

21:35.708 --> 21:36.629
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like you were traveling.

21:36.669 --> 21:40.852
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like having that travel thing just kind of exhaust you.

21:40.892 --> 21:42.013
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what I'm feeling today.

21:42.553 --> 21:45.295
[SPEAKER_20]: Travel's sick, I guess, but I'm not really sick.

21:45.335 --> 21:46.056
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just sore.

21:46.716 --> 21:47.997
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, man.

21:48.530 --> 21:50.851
[SPEAKER_20]: I went to work, I went to school, I went home, and that's about it.

22:18.618 --> 22:19.398
[SPEAKER_07]: I really didn't do shit.

22:20.119 --> 22:24.041
[SPEAKER_07]: Except Friday I started hacking up my lungs.

22:25.061 --> 22:29.143
[SPEAKER_07]: Saturday I went to this stupid Kaiser doctor who only saw me for 10 minutes.

22:35.247 --> 22:40.829
[SPEAKER_07]: And then hung out with Iguana Girl and Islander all day yesterday.

22:44.091 --> 22:46.913
[SPEAKER_07]: Watching wrestling DVDs and Fit TV.

22:48.217 --> 22:48.497
[SPEAKER_07]: All day.

22:48.557 --> 22:49.838
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a Fit TV channel now?

22:49.918 --> 22:50.118
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

22:50.218 --> 22:50.818
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's kind of neat.

22:51.419 --> 22:53.100
[SPEAKER_07]: We're watching a show about the Navy SEALs training.

22:53.660 --> 22:53.760
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh.

22:54.920 --> 22:56.801
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no excuse to ever skip the gym again.

22:57.902 --> 22:58.502
[SPEAKER_07]: No excuse.

22:59.963 --> 23:00.423
[SPEAKER_20]: Why's that?

23:01.624 --> 23:03.525
[SPEAKER_07]: You've seen the shit they do during their hell week?

23:04.005 --> 23:04.605
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh my god.

23:05.866 --> 23:11.449
[SPEAKER_07]: I've heard stories, but you know, I've never... Being... Having to tread water for 15 minutes in your underwear.

23:12.389 --> 23:13.810
[SPEAKER_07]: In really cold water.

23:13.890 --> 23:14.390
[SPEAKER_20]: That's hot.

23:15.791 --> 23:17.232
[SPEAKER_07]: And then having to do sit-ups...

23:18.590 --> 23:19.190
[SPEAKER_07]: In cold water.

23:20.531 --> 23:22.391
[SPEAKER_07]: And then lifting logs.

23:24.632 --> 23:25.372
[SPEAKER_07]: And lifting boats.

23:25.932 --> 23:29.033
[SPEAKER_20]: What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbors.

23:29.073 --> 23:30.073
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty vicious.

23:30.914 --> 23:32.434
[SPEAKER_07]: And then only getting two meals a day.

23:33.394 --> 23:34.835
[SPEAKER_07]: And then having it be MREs at that.

23:35.735 --> 23:37.035
[SPEAKER_20]: And having to get up early.

23:38.756 --> 23:42.077
[SPEAKER_07]: Going to bed around, what was it, 11?

23:42.797 --> 23:43.837
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting up before 30 in the morning.

23:43.857 --> 23:45.198
[SPEAKER_20]: Horrible.

23:46.098 --> 23:46.438
[SPEAKER_20]: Horrible.

23:47.612 --> 23:53.216
[SPEAKER_07]: The horrible part is eating the MREs.

23:54.878 --> 23:56.459
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not always yummy.

23:57.920 --> 23:58.541
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I hear.

24:00.862 --> 24:03.945
[SPEAKER_20]: So, anything else in your TV watching excitement adventures?

24:05.966 --> 24:06.146
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

24:08.008 --> 24:10.390
[SPEAKER_07]: I want someone to come to my house though and give me a Nautilus.

24:11.691 --> 24:12.511
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really cool.

24:13.532 --> 24:16.014
[SPEAKER_07]: Just came in and there's this show called House Calls.

24:16.634 --> 24:17.275
[SPEAKER_07]: I go in and

24:18.103 --> 24:18.764
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

24:47.652 --> 24:49.574
[SPEAKER_21]: My week had much less coughing.

24:53.617 --> 24:54.618
[SPEAKER_21]: What did I do this week?

24:55.658 --> 24:56.199
[SPEAKER_21]: Not much.

24:56.279 --> 24:57.560
[SPEAKER_21]: I played Lost Final Fantasy.

24:57.580 --> 24:59.141
[SPEAKER_21]: Of course.

25:00.702 --> 25:06.947
[SPEAKER_21]: I watched Robot Chicken again because it's hilarious.

25:09.209 --> 25:12.051
[SPEAKER_20]: I did not think the second week of Robot Chicken was nearly as funny as the first.

25:12.071 --> 25:12.872
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't as funny.

25:13.873 --> 25:23.361
[SPEAKER_21]: I gotta watch the third episode to kind of get a feel for whether that was just a bad episode or whether the first one was a really good episode.

25:23.421 --> 25:27.544
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, the first one was really, really good to hook us all in and now the rest of it's gonna suck.

25:28.285 --> 25:31.748
[SPEAKER_21]: It wasn't awful, but it wasn't hilarious.

25:32.328 --> 25:33.029
[SPEAKER_21]: It had its moments.

25:33.069 --> 25:36.672
[SPEAKER_20]: At least it's not like what was that American Dad where the first episode sucked.

25:37.373 --> 25:38.694
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, that's not looking good.

25:39.274 --> 25:41.376
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll take the new episode of The Family Guy and that's it.

25:43.122 --> 25:45.163
[SPEAKER_21]: So, yeah, I've basically been doing that.

25:46.084 --> 25:51.046
[SPEAKER_21]: I got the movie Appleseed, and I watched the whole thing for that, and that's really awesome.

25:51.846 --> 26:00.250
[SPEAKER_21]: And now at work, I'm sort of playing brand manager for Pioneer to try to get this.

26:00.730 --> 26:10.634
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm trying to get them to give me $1,000 to screen the movie at our theater at work, because that's how much it's going to cost for pizzas.

26:12.093 --> 26:12.533
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello?

26:13.114 --> 26:13.935
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me money.

26:14.475 --> 26:15.816
[SPEAKER_20]: Give me a thousand dollars.

26:16.137 --> 26:16.597
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

26:18.559 --> 26:21.782
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I don't know if that's going to fly, but I'm trying to help them out.

26:21.922 --> 26:28.828
[SPEAKER_21]: If they're going to want to sell this movie and get people to come see the screening, they're going to have to have food.

26:31.095 --> 26:39.580
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's not cheap to feed 170 people For those that don't know what Appleseed is all about Because, gasp, not everyone watches anime What is Appleseed about?

26:39.640 --> 26:47.844
[SPEAKER_21]: Appleseed is a fully CG anime movie That's all motion captured So it's really cool looking And it's playing in the Bay Area

26:50.461 --> 26:55.284
[SPEAKER_21]: So I got to finally finish watching that today and it was really neat.

26:55.865 --> 27:01.068
[SPEAKER_21]: I've never actually watched the original anime so I couldn't really say how different it was.

27:01.789 --> 27:10.915
[SPEAKER_21]: Then yesterday we went, myself and my fiance Nelly went and looked for apartments because our lease is up here pretty soon.

27:10.935 --> 27:13.496
[SPEAKER_20]: We have about seven weeks left in this studio.

27:13.817 --> 27:15.638
[SPEAKER_21]: And we have one and we found it.

27:15.678 --> 27:18.980
[SPEAKER_21]: We're moving in on the 16th of April.

27:19.620 --> 27:19.881
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh wow.

27:20.541 --> 27:21.843
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

27:36.638 --> 27:37.899
[SPEAKER_21]: And then what else did I do?

27:37.919 --> 27:40.822
[SPEAKER_21]: Other than get the big bag of gummy bears.

27:42.983 --> 27:43.704
[SPEAKER_21]: Not too much.

27:43.744 --> 27:47.287
[SPEAKER_21]: I've been feeling really lazy recently.

27:47.447 --> 27:50.349
[SPEAKER_21]: My headaches have been coming back and I think that's because of allergies.

27:51.090 --> 27:54.392
[SPEAKER_21]: So I took some Dayquil both today and yesterday and now I'm feeling good.

27:55.253 --> 27:55.693
[SPEAKER_21]: But, um...

27:57.185 --> 27:57.525
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know.

27:57.846 --> 27:59.987
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I actually played some games.

28:00.388 --> 28:06.252
[SPEAKER_21]: I played Alien vs. Predator on my MAME cabinet and played it all the way through on Sunday night.

28:06.773 --> 28:09.595
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I've actually used the MAME cabinet for something.

28:11.816 --> 28:14.759
[SPEAKER_21]: And... Yeah, that's pretty much it.

28:16.540 --> 28:18.542
[SPEAKER_07]: That reminds me, I did play something else.

28:18.782 --> 28:19.262
[SPEAKER_15]: What'd you play?

28:19.603 --> 28:21.084
[SPEAKER_07]: Lots and lots of Tekken 5.

28:21.144 --> 28:25.147
[SPEAKER_07]: The game is infuriatingly hard on easy mode.

28:25.592 --> 28:27.553
[SPEAKER_20]: It is pretty challenging on easy mode, even.

28:27.653 --> 28:29.575
[SPEAKER_07]: But the endings are hilarious.

28:30.776 --> 28:34.638
[SPEAKER_20]: And I suck at fighting games, so I've only beaten it with two characters so far.

28:34.658 --> 28:35.038
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot.

28:35.098 --> 28:39.381
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to bring over my memory card to give you the endings, but because I've got almost all of them.

28:39.481 --> 28:40.902
[SPEAKER_21]: That was the other thing I forgot.

28:41.703 --> 28:51.129
[SPEAKER_21]: I got registered for E3, and I'm also applying for a game sales position at our company, which I'll probably get because I know the most about games there.

28:51.209 --> 28:55.172
[SPEAKER_21]: But I'm sure they're going to try to fuck with me because, you know,

28:55.712 --> 28:56.632
[SPEAKER_21]: Just for some reason.

28:58.233 --> 29:01.273
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't trust this guy that's heading the department.

29:01.413 --> 29:09.595
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, he's okay, but he's been known to, like, you know, fuck with people for, like, you know, ride your ass on stupid things.

29:09.695 --> 29:11.815
[SPEAKER_21]: So, I don't know.

29:12.055 --> 29:12.416
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll see.

29:12.436 --> 29:16.396
[SPEAKER_21]: I should get it, but they're going to probably try to pull that, oh, well, you don't have enough experience.

29:16.776 --> 29:18.617
[SPEAKER_21]: Bullshit, I've been at the company for five years.

29:18.657 --> 29:20.097
[SPEAKER_21]: How much fucking experience do I need?

29:20.257 --> 29:24.138
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, but yet they'll hire someone out of the company, you know, instantly into the sales position.

29:25.031 --> 29:26.191
[SPEAKER_20]: Can't wait to hear about that drama.

29:27.111 --> 29:31.632
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so if I don't get that, I'm going to fucking leave that place because there's no point.

29:31.752 --> 29:35.533
[SPEAKER_21]: My position where I'm at right now is going to be obsolete pretty soon.

29:35.673 --> 29:42.214
[SPEAKER_21]: So, you know, if they're not going to give me a games position, seeing as I'm the most qualified, the other people that are applying don't know shit about games.

29:42.254 --> 29:45.795
[SPEAKER_21]: They just have console systems at home, so that makes them gamers.

29:46.315 --> 29:50.776
[SPEAKER_21]: And so, you know, it's really retarded, but whatever, you know.

29:51.969 --> 29:53.550
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:11.562 --> 30:12.603
[SPEAKER_21]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

30:27.857 --> 30:29.158
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, Madden anything?

30:29.178 --> 30:34.001
[SPEAKER_21]: Exactly, I'm like, you know, basically I'm like, yeah, I know that.

30:34.081 --> 30:35.842
[SPEAKER_20]: Madden fucking sells itself, though.

30:36.042 --> 30:38.084
[SPEAKER_20]: Or anything Xbox, in your case.

30:38.164 --> 30:48.811
[SPEAKER_21]: But after he told me that, you know, it's kind of like he repeated it to reinforce it, and I'm like, yeah, I understand that there's games I'm not gonna like that I have to sell to someone.

30:49.251 --> 30:50.352
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not a problem.

30:51.072 --> 30:51.793
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, it's just...

30:52.473 --> 31:00.819
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like they think that, oh, I'm so narrow in my perspective on game sales or something, but whatever.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.082
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll probably get it, and if I do get it, it'll be decent money.

31:05.503 --> 31:10.366
[SPEAKER_21]: Not going to say good money, because there's no such thing as good money at this company, unless you're a manager.

31:10.727 --> 31:11.327
[SPEAKER_20]: But better money.

31:11.947 --> 31:12.928
[SPEAKER_21]: Better money, yes.

31:13.829 --> 31:14.229
[SPEAKER_21]: That's good.

31:14.930 --> 31:18.632
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to go back to Tekken 5 for a minute, because I haven't gotten any hilarious endings.

31:18.672 --> 31:19.473
[SPEAKER_20]: The endings I got...

31:20.279 --> 31:20.959
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a pet tree.

31:20.999 --> 31:22.520
[SPEAKER_20]: Oops, I dropped the castle.

31:22.540 --> 31:28.404
[SPEAKER_20]: But seriously, if fighting game storylines are spoilers to you, then fighting game storylines really aren't that much.

31:40.526 --> 31:46.210
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, if we were going to tell you that, like, in Final Fantasy VII, Aeris dies, then that might be... Oh my god!

31:46.611 --> 31:48.012
[SPEAKER_21]: I did not see that coming!

31:48.492 --> 31:49.153
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god!

31:49.213 --> 31:50.093
[SPEAKER_20]: Now that's a spoiler.

31:50.113 --> 31:51.414
[SPEAKER_21]: You just totally spoiled that game.

31:51.474 --> 31:51.754
[SPEAKER_07]: I did.

31:51.775 --> 31:54.557
[SPEAKER_07]: You have no idea how much I cheered, because I hated that bitch.

31:56.498 --> 31:57.639
[SPEAKER_07]: I have my game saved.

31:58.422 --> 32:01.785
[SPEAKER_07]: at the battle, the Jenova battle, right before she dies.

32:02.445 --> 32:04.387
[SPEAKER_07]: So that I can watch it any time I want to.

32:04.687 --> 32:07.550
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my party is so severely overpowered at that point.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.312
[SPEAKER_07]: And I can watch the bitch die over.

32:10.412 --> 32:11.753
[SPEAKER_20]: You should go home and watch it tonight.

32:11.813 --> 32:12.574
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe you'll feel a little better.

32:12.634 --> 32:15.176
[SPEAKER_21]: And then Mario, the princess is in another castle.

32:18.259 --> 32:20.100
[SPEAKER_21]: She's always in another fucking castle.

32:20.401 --> 32:23.583
[SPEAKER_21]: You'd think he would ask for directions before rescuing the princess.

32:23.683 --> 32:25.065
[SPEAKER_07]: They have these things on...

32:27.193 --> 32:29.854
[SPEAKER_07]: On LickSang, I think I saw them, or Japan Video Games, one of them.

32:30.475 --> 32:36.578
[SPEAKER_07]: They have... Do you know how you get the little boxes that have a secret something in it of a theme?

32:36.798 --> 32:37.078
[SPEAKER_10]: Uh-huh.

32:37.118 --> 32:40.320
[SPEAKER_07]: They have... You've got bugs in your apartment.

32:40.800 --> 32:41.120
[SPEAKER_20]: We do.

32:41.981 --> 32:43.181
[SPEAKER_21]: Great, nothing wrong with this place.

32:43.221 --> 32:43.982
[SPEAKER_21]: Good thing we're leaving soon.

32:44.002 --> 32:47.724
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I know the government's been watching us, but I wasn't sure about that.

32:47.844 --> 32:50.565
[SPEAKER_07]: But they have Mario scene ones now.

32:51.306 --> 32:53.787
[SPEAKER_07]: And one of them is our princesses in another castle.

32:54.687 --> 32:55.528
[SPEAKER_07]: And then there's like...

32:56.007 --> 33:00.470
[SPEAKER_07]: The Fireball one, and there's the Coin Box one, and all kinds of stuff.

33:01.671 --> 33:02.512
[SPEAKER_20]: Mario's a great game.

33:03.573 --> 33:04.994
[SPEAKER_20]: So what are the funny endings in Tekken 5?

33:05.254 --> 33:06.475
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I haven't gotten them yet.

33:06.815 --> 33:07.976
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard Lee was funny.

33:08.216 --> 33:10.638
[SPEAKER_07]: Kuma and Panda are just hilarious.

33:11.159 --> 33:17.523
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're playing as Panda, Kuma comes up and says, Take these flowers, be my wife.

33:19.965 --> 33:24.849
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if anyone's ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3, but Blanka's ending is with Dan.

33:25.327 --> 33:27.908
[SPEAKER_07]: and Blanka, growl, growl, growl, oh, it's my good friend Dan.

33:28.468 --> 33:30.268
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what they do with Kuma and Panda.

33:31.388 --> 33:32.369
[SPEAKER_07]: And Roger Jr.

33:33.609 --> 33:35.049
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, the kangaroo is back.

33:36.130 --> 33:37.830
[SPEAKER_20]: He was the first character I unlocked, yeah.

33:37.930 --> 33:39.330
[SPEAKER_07]: Deviljin is like, whoo.

33:40.411 --> 33:41.591
[SPEAKER_07]: His ending is really evil.

33:41.891 --> 33:45.152
[SPEAKER_07]: I want... My favorite ending is Asuka's ending.

33:46.192 --> 33:46.592
[SPEAKER_07]: Because...

33:47.611 --> 34:07.312
[SPEAKER_07]: Jin's laying on the ground, all unconscious, beaten up to death, and she tries to wake him up, and then he jumps up, suddenly awake, and falls on her, with his face in her boobs, and she punches him across the screen.

34:08.490 --> 34:10.531
[SPEAKER_20]: It would be funnier if it was all chibi-fied when they did it.

34:10.811 --> 34:13.673
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the movies in Tekken 5 are actually really well done.

34:13.693 --> 34:15.914
[SPEAKER_20]: They're really nice looking and the music's very nice.

34:15.954 --> 34:17.095
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wrong, I just speak Korean.

34:17.815 --> 34:19.136
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

34:19.316 --> 34:23.178
[SPEAKER_20]: And they didn't all speak English, they all speak native languages and subtitle.

34:23.578 --> 34:24.579
[SPEAKER_20]: So I thought that's pretty cool.

34:25.600 --> 34:27.441
[SPEAKER_07]: I did like the thing with Julia and Gunryu.

34:28.221 --> 34:30.022
[SPEAKER_07]: See, I'm a big Tekken fan.

34:30.602 --> 34:33.344
[SPEAKER_07]: And if ever you follow the story, Gunryu had a thing for her mom.

34:34.673 --> 34:36.474
[SPEAKER_07]: So, he's going, Julia Jones!

34:37.335 --> 34:39.156
[SPEAKER_07]: She's like, what are you talking about?

34:41.157 --> 34:42.818
[SPEAKER_20]: When they fight each other, yeah, it's pretty funny.

34:43.018 --> 34:43.458
[SPEAKER_20]: I like that.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.640
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to beat it with Anna, though, because Anna's my favorite.

34:46.680 --> 34:47.401
[SPEAKER_07]: She's so my favorite.

34:47.441 --> 34:50.963
[SPEAKER_07]: The Anna and Nina endings, beat it with Anna first, and then beat it with Nina.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.744
[SPEAKER_21]: Wasn't there, like, an old guy in that or something?

34:53.764 --> 34:56.346
[SPEAKER_21]: When you're fighting him, he's like, nice boobs, or something.

34:56.366 --> 34:58.527
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, there's an old guy that's... I don't remember.

34:58.547 --> 34:59.208
[SPEAKER_20]: Who's the old guy?

34:59.248 --> 34:59.868
[SPEAKER_07]: Wong Jin-Rae.

35:00.108 --> 35:01.609
[SPEAKER_20]: Wong Jin-Rae, and when you fight...

35:02.426 --> 35:04.107
[SPEAKER_20]: with, I think, Zayu.

35:04.627 --> 35:09.270
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, if you fight him with her, then he makes that comment.

35:09.830 --> 35:11.431
[SPEAKER_07]: Zayu's ending is, of course, animated.

35:12.611 --> 35:13.992
[SPEAKER_07]: Like it was in Tekken 3.

35:14.232 --> 35:14.432
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

35:15.213 --> 35:16.734
[SPEAKER_20]: I have yet to go back and play Tekken 1, 2, 3.

35:17.934 --> 35:18.574
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they're on there.

35:19.495 --> 35:21.396
[SPEAKER_20]: Too bad they don't have Gon in this one again.

35:21.656 --> 35:22.016
[SPEAKER_07]: I know.

35:22.036 --> 35:24.798
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it was all about playing Tekken 4 with Gon.

35:26.939 --> 35:27.999
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, the Gon ending.

35:28.340 --> 35:29.860
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is just like reading one of the manga.

35:30.140 --> 35:31.021
[SPEAKER_07]: The Gon manga is funny.

35:32.011 --> 35:34.132
[SPEAKER_20]: What was I going to say?

35:34.532 --> 35:35.453
[SPEAKER_20]: The minigame in it.

35:36.193 --> 35:39.455
[SPEAKER_20]: I know this isn't supposed to be the Tekken chat show, but you know what?

35:39.475 --> 35:39.855
[SPEAKER_20]: Deal with it.

35:39.975 --> 35:42.917
[SPEAKER_07]: The little Tekken RPG thing?

35:42.997 --> 35:44.558
[SPEAKER_07]: We called it Devil Jin May Cry.

35:45.378 --> 35:47.540
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess, kind of, except it's really repetitive.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.580
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the only thing I didn't like about it.

35:48.600 --> 35:49.421
[SPEAKER_20]: It's very repetitive.

35:49.801 --> 35:52.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's pretty cool.

35:52.202 --> 35:53.623
[SPEAKER_20]: For a minigame, it's very cool.

35:54.243 --> 35:56.765
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it my hats off, too.

35:57.725 --> 36:00.747
[SPEAKER_07]: But the other funny endings that I saw...

36:02.071 --> 36:02.972
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of them were funny.

36:02.992 --> 36:04.233
[SPEAKER_07]: The Paul Phoenix one was funny.

36:04.793 --> 36:10.637
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in his dojo and there's a big sign on there that says, aliens come here to be beaten up or something.

36:10.997 --> 36:14.560
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he's saying that he's the strongest man in the universe and he can beat up aliens too.

36:15.360 --> 36:15.981
[SPEAKER_07]: So he's all...

36:16.434 --> 36:20.256
[SPEAKER_07]: Punching through a wall with an alien picture on it, like his old ending with Kuma on it.

36:21.137 --> 36:24.058
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you see the space station, you know, there's the space station level.

36:24.558 --> 36:33.643
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you see outside all these alien ships coming, and his voice playing over their loudspeakers.

36:34.424 --> 36:35.164
[SPEAKER_20]: I think I've seen that one.

36:35.624 --> 36:36.325
[SPEAKER_07]: That one was funny.

36:36.825 --> 36:38.586
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the one with Marshall Law.

36:40.009 --> 36:45.351
[SPEAKER_07]: where he just gets done paying off all of his debt and then Paul comes up with the bill for his bicycle.

36:46.291 --> 36:47.772
[SPEAKER_07]: Not his bicycle, his motorcycle.

36:48.752 --> 36:49.292
[SPEAKER_07]: That was funny.

36:51.013 --> 36:52.033
[SPEAKER_07]: I love Tekken so much.

36:52.614 --> 36:53.374
[SPEAKER_20]: Tekken's pretty cool.

36:53.634 --> 36:55.615
[SPEAKER_07]: I've always been the Namco fangirl.

36:55.995 --> 36:56.675
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know.

36:57.415 --> 37:04.338
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm hoping in the next Tekken, because you know there's going to be a Tekken 6, I'm hoping that the little prince from Katamari Damashii will cross over into it.

37:05.078 --> 37:05.899
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be great.

37:05.979 --> 37:06.899
[SPEAKER_20]: And roll everybody over.

37:09.540 --> 37:09.840
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

37:13.183 --> 37:16.386
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there was somebody else though that I thought would be funny.

37:17.547 --> 37:20.209
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had it in my head a moment ago and I forgot.

37:20.990 --> 37:22.391
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, if you think of it, just say so.

37:23.092 --> 37:24.593
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, meanwhile, we're going to move on to Angel.

37:24.733 --> 37:25.434
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, how was your week?

37:25.454 --> 37:25.774
[SPEAKER_20]: How was your day?

37:27.968 --> 37:31.610
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, let's see.

37:31.730 --> 37:33.611
[SPEAKER_06]: School on Tuesday and Thursday.

37:34.892 --> 37:39.774
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had posted earlier in the week that I lost my PS2 memory card.

37:39.854 --> 37:42.936
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't find it and forgot to post that I did find it.

37:43.056 --> 37:44.857
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yay, I can play my games again.

37:44.897 --> 37:46.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo!

37:49.579 --> 37:51.400
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing else, pretty much.

37:51.980 --> 37:53.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Except I had to reinstall PS2.

37:54.727 --> 37:56.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Operating Systems, yay!

37:56.608 --> 38:01.849
[SPEAKER_06]: No, just kidding, because now I have to reinstall Final Fantasy XI and take three hours of my life.

38:02.269 --> 38:09.712
[SPEAKER_06]: Not really, because I can do something else while that's installing and stuff, and I hate that update though, it's so long, yuck.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.853
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, all my other games are installed.

38:14.133 --> 38:17.574
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just, you know, this is the last one, so, yuck.

38:19.358 --> 38:20.358
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, not much.

38:21.879 --> 38:25.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Hoping to go to a certain convention here in a couple weeks.

38:25.361 --> 38:25.761
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

38:27.682 --> 38:28.362
[SPEAKER_06]: That should be fun.

38:28.782 --> 38:29.102
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

38:30.403 --> 38:33.224
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, other than that, nothing much.

38:34.464 --> 38:35.445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm boring this week.

38:37.406 --> 38:37.786
[SPEAKER_20]: That's alright.

38:37.806 --> 38:40.327
[SPEAKER_20]: This show kind of has a downer vibe to it tonight.

38:41.247 --> 38:41.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh wait, yeah.

38:41.827 --> 38:45.689
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, actually, there's actually an uppity part of my week in which I forgot.

38:46.149 --> 38:47.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I started DJing again!

38:48.854 --> 38:49.654
[SPEAKER_20]: You want to give that a plug?

38:49.874 --> 38:52.936
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're DJing for our competing radio station?

38:53.316 --> 38:53.696
[SPEAKER_06]: FIRED!

38:53.996 --> 38:55.096
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's cool.

38:55.276 --> 38:55.797
[SPEAKER_20]: Give us a plug.

38:56.037 --> 38:56.437
[SPEAKER_20]: Give it a plug.

38:57.397 --> 39:04.400
[SPEAKER_06]: www.rushiradio.com Tomorrow at 11 a.m.

39:04.880 --> 39:07.241
[SPEAKER_06]: to 1, I'll be on Pacific Time.

39:07.361 --> 39:10.342
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you guys want to tune in, whatever, I'll be there.

39:12.703 --> 39:13.103
[SPEAKER_20]: Very cool.

39:13.840 --> 39:14.460
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's see.

39:14.500 --> 39:15.341
[SPEAKER_20]: My week and my day.

39:16.241 --> 39:27.066
[SPEAKER_20]: Like I said last night, I was not here at home because I went to my old college town, which is a couple hours north of here, Chico, California, for those who may have heard of it, because it's kind of a legendary party school.

39:27.086 --> 39:27.966
[SPEAKER_20]: That's where I went to college.

39:28.587 --> 39:31.548
[SPEAKER_20]: And we went out to like four different bars last night.

39:31.588 --> 39:33.989
[SPEAKER_20]: We just went, like, we went fucking bar hopping, okay?

39:34.169 --> 39:36.030
[SPEAKER_20]: We literally, like, just went from bar to bar.

39:36.490 --> 39:40.392
[SPEAKER_20]: And I remembered why people go to Chico to party, because up

39:40.859 --> 39:44.304
[SPEAKER_20]: A little glass of beer that would cost me like $4 at one of our bars here.

39:45.105 --> 39:48.128
[SPEAKER_20]: Like a glass of, what, a pint of Newcastle, okay?

39:48.669 --> 39:50.752
[SPEAKER_20]: Costs like $4 at a local bar here.

39:50.892 --> 39:52.194
[SPEAKER_20]: A buck fifty in Chico.

39:52.914 --> 39:53.615
[SPEAKER_20]: It's crazy.

39:54.396 --> 39:56.259
[SPEAKER_20]: So, very happy about that.

39:57.173 --> 40:06.199
[SPEAKER_20]: and just, you know, had good times with some friends out there and just, you know, danced and drank and stuff and had crammed like 13 people into a Motel 6 room.

40:06.239 --> 40:06.700
[SPEAKER_20]: Good times.

40:07.940 --> 40:11.943
[SPEAKER_20]: But then I slept... Well, some of us, instead of sleeping in Motel 6, we went to this one girl's house.

40:12.383 --> 40:14.005
[SPEAKER_20]: Met this awesome girl up in Chico.

40:14.065 --> 40:14.725
[SPEAKER_20]: She's awesome.

40:15.305 --> 40:16.106
[SPEAKER_20]: She's young.

40:16.286 --> 40:18.167
[SPEAKER_20]: She's just fun.

40:18.267 --> 40:19.148
[SPEAKER_20]: She's great to be around.

40:19.488 --> 40:22.490
[SPEAKER_20]: And she's got her own apartment and she had us all over there.

40:23.211 --> 40:23.291
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

40:23.891 --> 40:24.752
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40:45.356 --> 40:48.018
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, you know, the poles that hold it all together.

40:48.599 --> 40:51.101
[SPEAKER_20]: And I woke up this morning just so sore.

40:51.181 --> 40:51.441
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

40:51.641 --> 40:53.963
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I swear to God, I feel like the princess and the pea.

40:54.524 --> 41:00.649
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, you know how in the princess and the pea, the evil queen or something puts one pea under 20 mattresses?

41:01.029 --> 41:02.971
[SPEAKER_20]: And she wakes up, she's like, I'm so sore.

41:03.051 --> 41:04.933
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel something on my back all night long.

41:05.453 --> 41:05.974
[SPEAKER_20]: That's me.

41:06.594 --> 41:07.855
[SPEAKER_20]: I was the prince and the pole.

41:08.075 --> 41:09.517
[SPEAKER_20]: That was my story.

41:09.617 --> 41:10.978
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was no fun at all.

41:12.273 --> 41:15.997
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to tell an interesting story that I thought would be interesting.

41:16.017 --> 41:21.902
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't get into political issues very often, but I had to say this.

41:23.111 --> 41:28.655
[SPEAKER_20]: I was out at one of the bars yesterday, and we were at this place called Joe's, which is a little pub-type place.

41:28.715 --> 41:33.799
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of got a pub atmosphere, and they've got sawdust all over the floor, which I think is really funny, because it's like walking into a barn.

41:34.219 --> 41:35.040
[SPEAKER_20]: It kind of smells like a barn.

41:35.300 --> 41:38.482
[SPEAKER_20]: And my friend says that's to pick up the vomit really easy, which kind of makes sense, you know.

41:39.282 --> 41:39.703
[SPEAKER_20]: Sawdust.

41:41.664 --> 41:42.905
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's hilarious.

41:43.345 --> 41:45.547
[SPEAKER_20]: So there's sawdust all over the ground, and...

41:46.232 --> 41:50.514
[SPEAKER_20]: We were walking through the bar to get to the outside area so we could all take a huge table outside.

41:51.094 --> 41:54.215
[SPEAKER_20]: And there was this guy who was wearing a frat shirt.

41:54.835 --> 41:57.596
[SPEAKER_20]: And it had the big Greek letters on it, right?

41:57.656 --> 41:58.317
[SPEAKER_20]: His frat shirt.

41:58.357 --> 42:01.958
[SPEAKER_20]: And then underneath it, it said, Against Gay Frats.

42:04.159 --> 42:07.820
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was just like, what's your problem?

42:10.501 --> 42:12.542
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you care if a gay frat starts up?

42:13.982 --> 42:17.206
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you afraid they're going to, you know, come attack you?

42:17.947 --> 42:25.155
[SPEAKER_20]: Are you afraid that the sorority girls might go to their parties because they'll have more fun and they won't get raped at those parties?

42:25.596 --> 42:26.597
[SPEAKER_21]: You're talking about gay people.

42:26.637 --> 42:29.100
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not like the Jehovah's Witness or something where they just like...

42:30.813 --> 42:32.154
[SPEAKER_21]: I've dated a gay frat house before.

42:45.791 --> 42:46.272
[SPEAKER_07]: It was fun.

43:03.208 --> 43:07.130
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, are you worried there's going to be competition in sports or something?

43:07.190 --> 43:13.793
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, this is just so, like, the 80s, you know, where it was the revenge of the nerds, now it's the revenge of the gays.

43:14.213 --> 43:19.195
[SPEAKER_21]: It's seriously, you know, jocks have always been against one, you know, minority of people.

43:19.615 --> 43:28.839
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, whether it be, you know, nerds, or, I don't know, gays, or like, you know, even going further back, blacks.

43:29.491 --> 43:31.992
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, it's just, you know, that's what frats do.

43:32.092 --> 43:36.675
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like they get drunk, they're like, okay, now we have to be an activist at something.

43:36.915 --> 43:39.156
[SPEAKER_20]: We have to make ourselves feel better by making fun of somebody.

43:39.176 --> 43:49.462
[SPEAKER_21]: How about we impress a group of people so that we can feel more masculine and that way we can, you know, dignify ourselves for being stupid and not getting anywhere in life.

43:50.962 --> 43:51.183
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

43:52.810 --> 43:55.732
[SPEAKER_20]: Another story, there was a fraternity up there in Chico.

43:55.752 --> 44:05.276
[SPEAKER_20]: You might have heard this in the news, but they made some guy, as part of a hazing ritual, swallow five gallons of water, and the guy fucking drowned from drinking so much water.

44:05.296 --> 44:07.177
[SPEAKER_20]: They forced him to drink all this water.

44:07.197 --> 44:08.898
[SPEAKER_20]: He fucking died from it, right?

44:09.338 --> 44:11.139
[SPEAKER_20]: That would never happen in a gay fraternity.

44:11.419 --> 44:13.260
[SPEAKER_20]: The only thing you get drowned in is love.

44:17.882 --> 44:18.162
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just...

44:19.577 --> 44:21.138
[SPEAKER_20]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

44:49.880 --> 44:56.342
[SPEAKER_20]: From what I understand, they're actually pretty similar to straight fraternities, just without all the bullshit.

44:56.743 --> 45:02.805
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think what was really funny is we all went back there and we just started bitching and we were talking about what an idiot the guy must be.

45:02.845 --> 45:06.446
[SPEAKER_20]: There's like 13 of us, girls and guys, straight, gay, everything.

45:06.506 --> 45:08.106
[SPEAKER_20]: Just an eclectic group of people, right?

45:08.507 --> 45:10.367
[SPEAKER_20]: Just sitting around like how stupid this guy was.

45:10.387 --> 45:15.849
[SPEAKER_20]: In fact, I called this one girl the ringleader of Algada because she was talking about how she wanted to go firebomb their house and stuff.

45:16.569 --> 45:16.689
[SPEAKER_20]: And

45:20.453 --> 45:29.696
[SPEAKER_20]: I think what happened is that the guy sitting at the table across from us was in that same fraternity because I saw the two of them talking later on in the evening and they looked at us weird when we left.

45:30.336 --> 45:31.436
[SPEAKER_20]: And I was just kind of like, eh, whatever.

45:31.737 --> 45:32.337
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what you get.

45:34.377 --> 45:35.558
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyway, that was my little rant.

45:35.998 --> 45:36.538
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

45:37.118 --> 45:38.118
[SPEAKER_07]: Hating is stupid.

45:39.639 --> 45:40.699
[SPEAKER_20]: I hate people that hate.

45:41.179 --> 45:41.960
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate them too.

45:42.600 --> 45:44.500
[SPEAKER_20]: I have no tolerance for intolerance.

45:44.961 --> 45:45.921
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, damn them.

45:46.901 --> 45:49.162
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to ostracize them from our society.

45:49.182 --> 45:49.322
[SPEAKER_07]: Ugh.

45:51.721 --> 45:53.203
[SPEAKER_20]: We should not allow them to get married.

45:53.723 --> 45:54.083
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

45:54.664 --> 45:55.424
[SPEAKER_07]: They need to be neutered.

45:56.665 --> 45:58.487
[SPEAKER_20]: Because that just encourages reproduction.

46:00.508 --> 46:03.090
[SPEAKER_07]: I really do think that there needs to be a breeding test.

46:05.132 --> 46:09.675
[SPEAKER_07]: A standardized test for potential parents.

46:10.336 --> 46:12.297
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you fail, tied.

46:13.318 --> 46:19.002
[SPEAKER_20]: Which one of these would not make a good bed for your baby?

46:19.823 --> 46:19.843
[SPEAKER_20]: A.

46:20.543 --> 46:36.455
[SPEAKER_20]: Crib, B, Bassinet, C, Tupperware Container Seriously, have you ever seen the back of one of those Tupperware storage things?

46:36.495 --> 46:38.637
[SPEAKER_20]: Like the huge ones that you're supposed to put your clothes in?

46:38.937 --> 46:48.625
[SPEAKER_20]: You look at the back and it has the little do-nots I laugh because I've seen it Yes, and it has the little do-nots in the back And one of them has a do-not And it has a little picture of a baby in the Tupperware container

46:49.784 --> 46:53.706
[SPEAKER_20]: Who in the hell is stupid enough to... And you know they only put that on there because somebody did it.

46:56.048 --> 47:05.893
[SPEAKER_19]: If you're putting your baby in a Tupperware container, and even worse, maybe I can see somebody putting a baby in a Tupperware container just for a little bit so they don't get into things.

47:06.333 --> 47:07.714
[SPEAKER_21]: But putting the lid on it?

47:08.074 --> 47:09.855
[SPEAKER_21]: Dude, this is all the Japanese fault.

47:09.976 --> 47:11.456
[SPEAKER_21]: And I can tell you why.

47:11.697 --> 47:12.457
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to get into this.

47:13.107 --> 47:22.216
[SPEAKER_21]: I saw a video last night, now don't ask me why I'm browsing strange fetish videos for Japanese, whatever, it's on that SuperZooie because you got all the weird shit on there.

47:22.476 --> 47:38.051
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, they have a fetish thing where they actually vacuum seal people inside those storage bags, women, and they just leave them there, like, as they suck all the air out, and I'm like, that's weird.

47:38.959 --> 47:40.259
[SPEAKER_21]: But it's people like that.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.220
[SPEAKER_21]: That's why they have to put these things on here.

47:42.380 --> 47:43.621
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't vacuum seal your kids.

47:44.761 --> 47:45.761
[SPEAKER_21]: That will not keep them fresh.

47:49.383 --> 47:50.663
[SPEAKER_20]: I just... I don't know.

47:51.804 --> 47:53.084
[SPEAKER_20]: I weep for the future.

47:53.704 --> 47:54.364
[SPEAKER_20]: I really do.

47:56.365 --> 47:58.066
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, what else did I do this week?

47:58.366 --> 48:00.947
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been taking a hiatus from Final Fantasy XI this week.

48:01.027 --> 48:02.927
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm on vacation from Vanadil.

48:03.448 --> 48:05.468
[SPEAKER_20]: So I've been playing other games, like Final Fantasy II.

48:06.409 --> 48:07.329
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been going back and playing that

48:08.409 --> 48:11.430
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm actually doing pretty well at Final Fantasy 2, and it's actually a pretty neat game.

48:11.450 --> 48:12.350
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about Final Fantasy 3.

48:13.590 --> 48:15.991
[SPEAKER_20]: Which is the one game they need to release here, dammit.

48:16.211 --> 48:17.591
[SPEAKER_20]: And they're supposed to do it on the DS later.

48:17.611 --> 48:19.192
[SPEAKER_07]: Final Fantasy 3 was the job change game.

48:19.832 --> 48:21.292
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, that was the first job change.

48:21.372 --> 48:22.533
[SPEAKER_07]: And it was pretty cool.

48:23.013 --> 48:26.554
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I did not realize that Chocobos actually first appeared in Final Fantasy 2.

48:27.074 --> 48:28.454
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought they did not make an appearance until 3.

48:28.674 --> 48:29.974
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it was 2.

48:30.374 --> 48:33.975
[SPEAKER_20]: And by the way, we're talking Japanese numbers here, not the Americanized 2 and 3.

48:34.195 --> 48:36.356
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think Final Fantasy 5 was the best of all of them.

48:38.688 --> 48:40.549
[SPEAKER_20]: It's okay, my favorite is still four.

48:40.850 --> 48:42.191
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's all about butts.

48:43.472 --> 48:43.852
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

48:46.414 --> 48:55.682
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how some names are... In Japanese, it would be like Batsu, like that.

48:57.384 --> 49:00.687
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you try to Romanize it, it would be butt...

49:02.566 --> 49:08.929
[SPEAKER_07]: And the copy that I had that was translated, I had it done... Because I first tried to play it in Japanese, and I got decently through it.

49:09.449 --> 49:18.753
[SPEAKER_20]: The second one I had that was a translated ROM... Yeah, there was that huge... Like, it was... This was... Because Final Fantasy V was like the first fully translated Japanese ROM that hit the internet.

49:18.773 --> 49:19.553
[SPEAKER_20]: It was huge.

49:19.673 --> 49:20.394
[SPEAKER_20]: I even played that.

49:20.434 --> 49:21.014
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember that.

49:21.074 --> 49:28.117
[SPEAKER_20]: That's when I first really played Final Fantasy V. And I understood why they didn't release it in the United States, because it was too complicated...

49:28.942 --> 49:30.463
[SPEAKER_20]: for the audience at the time, I think.

49:30.483 --> 49:31.544
[SPEAKER_07]: The first dumb Americans.

49:32.125 --> 49:32.545
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically.

49:32.565 --> 49:35.087
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it was a step up, but now, oh, no big deal now.

49:35.668 --> 49:46.898
[SPEAKER_07]: But I also, actually, the big ROM to me, the one that caused the biggest stir, was when they did Seiken Densetsu 3, which was the one after Secret of Mana over here.

49:46.918 --> 49:48.239
[SPEAKER_20]: That was huge, too.

49:48.419 --> 49:52.222
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the first Seiken Densetsu was brought in the US as a Final Fantasy adventure.

49:52.362 --> 49:52.583
[SPEAKER_20]: Right.

49:53.383 --> 49:54.144
[SPEAKER_07]: But that was,

49:54.577 --> 49:57.639
[SPEAKER_07]: And they had gone so far as to translate the graphics.

49:58.700 --> 49:59.981
[SPEAKER_07]: Like street signs and things.

50:00.281 --> 50:00.702
[SPEAKER_20]: That's cool.

50:01.722 --> 50:02.783
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what though, I've got to be honest.

50:02.803 --> 50:05.345
[SPEAKER_20]: Second Dentist 2 and 3 is one that I didn't really get into.

50:06.086 --> 50:10.389
[SPEAKER_20]: I was probably more into, sad enough, I was more into Secret of Evermore.

50:10.869 --> 50:12.130
[SPEAKER_20]: Probably that I was into that.

50:12.470 --> 50:15.212
[SPEAKER_07]: I was just happy to find a ROM of Panorama Cotton.

50:16.333 --> 50:20.156
[SPEAKER_07]: Which, for anyone who is a big video game nerd like me,

50:20.737 --> 50:23.298
[SPEAKER_07]: Panorama Cotton, they only made like 600 copies of.

50:24.158 --> 50:26.019
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually have a friend who owns one.

50:27.120 --> 50:35.063
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have actually the one after that on Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton.

50:35.423 --> 50:39.565
[SPEAKER_07]: The normal Cotton games are about the little witch that throws up whenever she eats this one candy.

50:40.185 --> 50:41.505
[SPEAKER_07]: The wheel-o candy.

50:42.266 --> 50:43.846
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're normally a side-scrolling game.

50:43.926 --> 50:50.429
[SPEAKER_07]: It came out on Neo Geo Pocket, it came out on Super Nintendo back when, PC Engine, which I have the one on PC Engine Duo.

50:52.401 --> 50:58.082
[SPEAKER_07]: But this one was a behind-the-character one, sort of a third-person perspective.

50:59.122 --> 51:00.743
[SPEAKER_07]: And you were flying the whole time.

51:00.863 --> 51:01.483
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty cool.

51:01.723 --> 51:06.864
[SPEAKER_07]: But this was all done sort of... I know Mode 7 was the Super Nintendo thing, but it reminded me a lot of that.

51:06.904 --> 51:07.444
[SPEAKER_20]: Heck yeah.

51:07.844 --> 51:09.164
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was really awesome.

51:09.904 --> 51:13.065
[SPEAKER_07]: And they made like 600 copies of it, and someone finally did a ROM of it.

51:16.266 --> 51:17.946
[SPEAKER_07]: Any notes?

51:19.557 --> 51:23.838
[SPEAKER_07]: I think one of these days I'm going to bring over the Dreamcast and Rainbow Cotton.

51:26.659 --> 51:27.499
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to see this.

51:27.739 --> 51:34.381
[SPEAKER_20]: And, you know, you've kind of been doing that lately where you're bringing over games and just kind of making us look at them.

51:34.662 --> 51:36.282
[SPEAKER_07]: I could bring over Super Producers.

51:36.342 --> 51:46.005
[SPEAKER_07]: It's basically like the precursor to the American Idol video games where you could pick out your little idol, dress her up, and teach her how to dance, although I need an FAQ.

51:48.323 --> 51:52.486
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I have the Marky Mark one.

51:53.166 --> 51:57.689
[SPEAKER_07]: It's either the Marky Mark one I have or the Criss Cross one.

51:57.709 --> 51:58.990
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I have the Criss Cross one, actually.

52:02.853 --> 52:06.315
[SPEAKER_07]: And I have the CD plus G disc that has the Information Society songs on it.

52:07.076 --> 52:11.199
[SPEAKER_20]: Our chatroom is complaining that we are depressing them tonight with our subdued chat tonight.

52:13.627 --> 52:16.008
[SPEAKER_20]: I apologize we can't be peppy every night.

52:16.088 --> 52:19.931
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I tried to be more energetic, I would cough a little cookie all over the microphone.

52:20.011 --> 52:20.871
[SPEAKER_07]: It would be disgusting.

52:21.191 --> 52:21.472
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

52:22.072 --> 52:22.972
[SPEAKER_20]: Microphones are not cheap.

52:23.813 --> 52:25.134
[SPEAKER_07]: Bring me food.

52:25.614 --> 52:26.094
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

52:27.495 --> 52:28.336
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a hot burrito.

52:29.796 --> 52:30.117
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

52:30.757 --> 52:36.280
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crisscross with a K, not a C. I miss the bush.

52:36.960 --> 52:40.643
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie may be sick, but she's not too sick to correct you if you get some...

52:43.356 --> 52:44.897
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:07.011 --> 53:07.952
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

53:33.140 --> 53:35.742
[SPEAKER_20]: Some Thomas Howard Lichtenstein as well.

53:35.762 --> 53:36.822
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got to get him in there as well.

53:37.203 --> 53:41.185
[SPEAKER_20]: So Guitar Freak Strumania V started off with a little bit of poo.

53:41.205 --> 53:42.086
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this.

54:15.956 --> 54:25.782
I'll spin back and turn my mouth with a big smile Please don't shatter me, kill, kill me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,

54:45.095 --> 54:47.096
and the rest of the band.

55:25.498 --> 55:26.299
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

55:51.119 --> 55:51.900
Thank you for watching!

56:23.621 --> 56:24.242
Thanks for watching!

56:32.128 --> 56:33.229
Where are you looking?

56:33.249 --> 56:34.370
Who are you talking to?

56:34.390 --> 56:35.231
Who are you talking to?

56:35.251 --> 56:36.532
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:36.572 --> 56:38.313
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:38.333 --> 56:40.175
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:40.215 --> 56:42.056
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:42.096 --> 56:43.958
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:43.978 --> 56:45.879
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:45.899 --> 56:48.361
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:48.381 --> 56:50.143
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:50.183 --> 56:52.404
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:52.424 --> 56:54.246
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:54.286 --> 56:56.107
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:56.127 --> 56:57.749
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:57.769 --> 56:59.770
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

56:59.790 --> 57:01.652
Do you believe in the existence of the future?

57:01.852 --> 57:02.833
Thank you for watching!

57:20.288 --> 57:21.209
Thank you for watching!

57:44.282 --> 57:45.383
Thank you for watching!

57:59.742 --> 58:01.102
You don't know, it's all up to you.

58:01.122 --> 58:04.983
Things you've never seen before, things you've never heard before.

58:05.003 --> 58:07.604
The story begins with the sunset and the sea.

58:34.989 --> 58:36.072
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

58:39.791 --> 58:40.711
Thank you for watching!

59:12.267 --> 59:13.268
Thanks for watching!

59:39.785 --> 59:50.770
[SPEAKER_11]: So now that you're getting older, you're growing up Something to tell you I'm talking to you now, Father to Son I know that you're gonna be big strong enough

59:57.854 --> 01:00:06.156
[SPEAKER_11]: You know I thought of you See how you finished what you begun Such a new world is waiting for you I know you can do it Whatever you want

01:00:16.659 --> 01:00:17.700
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

01:01:04.752 --> 01:01:07.954
[SPEAKER_20]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.

01:01:08.274 --> 01:01:10.295
[SPEAKER_14]: No!

01:01:10.515 --> 01:01:11.175
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kidding.

01:01:11.595 --> 01:01:14.257
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio, Crap Free Bavani Radio.

01:01:16.601 --> 01:01:19.882
[SPEAKER_20]: With the exception of that last segment there, according to some of our listeners.

01:01:20.283 --> 01:01:20.903
[SPEAKER_20]: Bitches!

01:01:23.324 --> 01:01:25.885
[SPEAKER_20]: They don't like hearing about our weeks or days anymore, I don't think.

01:01:26.165 --> 01:01:27.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, screw them.

01:01:27.906 --> 01:01:29.306
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we listen to their weeks.

01:01:29.546 --> 01:01:30.627
[SPEAKER_07]: No, actually, we don't do that.

01:01:32.368 --> 01:01:33.188
[SPEAKER_20]: But we would.

01:01:33.288 --> 01:01:34.929
[SPEAKER_20]: We read a lot of their live journals.

01:01:35.609 --> 01:01:39.290
[SPEAKER_20]: We read whatever they post in the Orange Lounge community, although not a lot of people post there.

01:01:39.310 --> 01:01:40.671
[SPEAKER_20]: But when they do, we read it.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:48.443
[SPEAKER_20]: You know that starting this week, we actually have the Rice Princess, who you might know from outside the box.

01:01:48.864 --> 01:01:52.726
[SPEAKER_20]: She has started the 1UP.com Orange Lounge Radio Club.

01:01:53.866 --> 01:01:55.367
[SPEAKER_07]: Does that mean I have to sign up for that thing?

01:01:55.847 --> 01:01:56.327
[SPEAKER_20]: If you want.

01:01:56.387 --> 01:02:01.150
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you don't have to, but it's another... Ever since the... I've been kind of scared of those other sites now.

01:02:01.470 --> 01:02:02.090
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:02:02.210 --> 01:02:03.151
[SPEAKER_20]: 1UP.com is kind of cool.

01:02:03.951 --> 01:02:05.292
[SPEAKER_20]: I like what they're doing.

01:02:05.372 --> 01:02:05.472
[SPEAKER_20]: It's...

01:02:06.812 --> 01:02:07.392
[SPEAKER_20]: It's different.

01:02:07.872 --> 01:02:10.793
[SPEAKER_20]: As far as the gaming sites go, I like it.

01:02:11.113 --> 01:02:11.974
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it a thumbs up.

01:02:12.714 --> 01:02:29.199
[SPEAKER_20]: There are some things I think would make it better, but considering that the blogging aspects and the community aspect was not really what the site was built around, it was supposed to be like a game spot style site, basically to compliment the magazines that Ziff Davis puts out, Electronic Gaming Monthly and stuff.

01:02:30.839 --> 01:02:35.841
[SPEAKER_20]: Considering that that stuff was kind of more of an afterthought or a secondary, it's not that bad.

01:02:36.281 --> 01:02:38.142
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

01:03:04.398 --> 01:03:05.358
[SPEAKER_20]: and some other little things.

01:03:05.378 --> 01:03:18.584
[SPEAKER_20]: So the cool thing about the 1UP Club that none of the other stuff we have really offers is that, you know, since Rice Princess works with us quite a bit, she has a lot of pictures from the inside, quote-unquote, and like old logos and marketing things and things like that.

01:03:18.664 --> 01:03:21.825
[SPEAKER_20]: So she's adding a lot of that to the community.

01:03:21.845 --> 01:03:22.365
[SPEAKER_20]: So check it out.

01:03:22.645 --> 01:03:26.146
[SPEAKER_20]: It's orangeloungeradio-club.1up.com.

01:03:26.527 --> 01:03:28.687
[SPEAKER_20]: But we'll put that link in the chat room for those of you guys who might have missed it.

01:03:29.768 --> 01:03:30.028
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

01:03:30.666 --> 01:03:31.066
[SPEAKER_20]: RedOctane

01:03:49.918 --> 01:03:55.943
[SPEAKER_20]: and say that they were going to be writing a game, although some people kind of jumped to that conclusion, but they said they were going to start publishing games for PlayStation 2.

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:57.565
[SPEAKER_20]: And what did we say?

01:03:57.645 --> 01:04:02.349
[SPEAKER_20]: We said, gee, it would be a great outlet for In the Groove, wouldn't it?

01:04:02.629 --> 01:04:05.972
[SPEAKER_20]: Wouldn't surprise me at all to see In the Groove be the game that's published by these guys.

01:04:06.573 --> 01:04:07.994
[SPEAKER_20]: Sure enough, not even...

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:12.247
[SPEAKER_20]: Two hours after the show's over, it leaks to the internet.

01:04:12.287 --> 01:04:27.029
[SPEAKER_20]: Some no-name fitness gaming site posts this article that confirms that Red Octane donated copies of In the Groove for PlayStation 2 to this local school for their fitness program, and it was just a wildfire from there.

01:04:27.269 --> 01:04:30.030
[SPEAKER_20]: DDR Freak picked it up, we picked it up, it ran everywhere.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:36.351
[SPEAKER_20]: So now everybody knows, and Red Octane finally made the official announcement, the game they are publishing is in fact In the Groove.

01:04:38.467 --> 01:04:40.009
[SPEAKER_07]: If you can see me, roll my eyes.

01:04:41.972 --> 01:04:42.853
[SPEAKER_07]: But I don't get on the webcam.

01:04:45.237 --> 01:04:46.879
[SPEAKER_20]: It's interesting news, nonetheless.

01:04:46.899 --> 01:04:48.481
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll go cough up a lung cookie in its honor.

01:04:49.582 --> 01:04:50.783
[SPEAKER_20]: It's interesting news nonetheless.

01:04:50.843 --> 01:05:04.818
[SPEAKER_20]: No, actually, what's interesting, and I didn't get to this in How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because I knew I would want to come back and talk about this later, but I actually decided, because we have an In The Groove machine here in Sacramento now, where Orange Launch Radio is based, I decided I was going to go play it this week.

01:05:04.878 --> 01:05:05.278
[SPEAKER_20]: So I did.

01:05:05.318 --> 01:05:08.702
[SPEAKER_20]: I went Wednesday night, I had the arcade all to myself, so it was awesome.

01:05:09.062 --> 01:05:10.183
[SPEAKER_20]: And I played in the groove again.

01:05:10.643 --> 01:05:15.365
[SPEAKER_20]: And I still, you know, to give it a fair chance, I wanted to see, do I warm up to it a little more?

01:05:15.445 --> 01:05:18.046
[SPEAKER_20]: Do I maybe go, what was I thinking the first time?

01:05:18.586 --> 01:05:19.687
[SPEAKER_20]: I still feel the same way.

01:05:19.947 --> 01:05:20.947
[SPEAKER_20]: My opinion hasn't changed.

01:05:21.387 --> 01:05:22.748
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't dislike in the groove.

01:05:22.988 --> 01:05:26.430
[SPEAKER_20]: So please don't talk about how much Sky on Earth is ready to do dogs in the groove.

01:05:26.450 --> 01:05:27.690
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I don't dislike the game.

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:33.332
[SPEAKER_20]: But I don't think it's God's greatest gift to dance games either.

01:05:33.352 --> 01:05:33.873
[SPEAKER_07]: It's good.

01:05:34.813 --> 01:05:36.014
[SPEAKER_07]: For me to poop on.

01:05:38.922 --> 01:05:39.842
[SPEAKER_20]: For me, it's middle ground.

01:05:39.863 --> 01:05:42.004
[SPEAKER_20]: There's things I like about it, there's things I don't like about it.

01:05:42.424 --> 01:05:45.806
[SPEAKER_20]: To recap, what I don't like about it, it's fugly.

01:05:46.226 --> 01:05:47.827
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like the game because it's fugly.

01:05:48.587 --> 01:05:52.929
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't care for the interface, I don't care for the way the game looks in-game, I don't like the way the arrows scroll.

01:05:52.989 --> 01:05:56.031
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, I know you can change it, but even when you change it, it's still fugly.

01:05:56.071 --> 01:05:59.332
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like the way the arrows look, I don't like the way the backgrounds look, I don't like the look.

01:05:59.833 --> 01:06:01.434
[SPEAKER_20]: So sorry, but I think it's fugly.

01:06:02.014 --> 01:06:07.997
[SPEAKER_20]: And a lot of the things that draw people to DDR is the fact that it's chibi and it's cute and it flashes and it's seizure-ific.

01:06:09.352 --> 01:06:10.713
[SPEAKER_20]: In The Groove is missing that completely.

01:06:11.953 --> 01:06:14.814
[SPEAKER_20]: What I like about In The Groove, I like the minds.

01:06:15.074 --> 01:06:17.655
[SPEAKER_20]: They make a lot of the songs pretty cool.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:22.437
[SPEAKER_20]: I like, for the most part, I can't say the step charts are bad.

01:06:22.858 --> 01:06:25.719
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they're different, they're neat, they're fun.

01:06:26.399 --> 01:06:31.061
[SPEAKER_20]: They're not very freestyle-able on the easier levels, but they're, you know, I guess fun on the hard levels.

01:06:31.479 --> 01:06:33.420
[SPEAKER_20]: But then we get back into what I don't like about it.

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:45.107
[SPEAKER_20]: What I don't like about it is that it's just, you know, an orgy of all these uber difficult songs that are for a very select, elite few DDR players to be playing.

01:06:45.968 --> 01:06:47.969
[SPEAKER_20]: And I just, I don't know, I don't...

01:06:50.891 --> 01:06:59.576
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it would have difficulty getting into the masses when this is kind of its big thing is that, hey, it's a game that's harder than DDR.

01:06:59.796 --> 01:07:08.681
[SPEAKER_20]: But of course, they're going back and fixing some of this because when they announced that they're doing this on the PS2, they announced they're going to do an all novice level and that, you know, their sequels are going to have novice levels.

01:07:08.701 --> 01:07:09.962
[SPEAKER_20]: So fine, they're changing some of that.

01:07:10.002 --> 01:07:11.683
[SPEAKER_20]: But regardless, it's not there now.

01:07:13.055 --> 01:07:15.897
[SPEAKER_20]: So anyway, you know, just kind of long story short, things I like, things I don't like.

01:07:15.957 --> 01:07:18.399
[SPEAKER_20]: And the song list, I'm very meh on.

01:07:18.459 --> 01:07:21.401
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, there's some songs I really, really, really like, really, really like.

01:07:21.742 --> 01:07:24.364
[SPEAKER_20]: There's some songs that are just very, they're filler.

01:07:24.384 --> 01:07:25.785
[SPEAKER_20]: They're absolute filler songs.

01:07:27.106 --> 01:07:28.787
[SPEAKER_20]: So, that's my take on In The Groove.

01:07:29.267 --> 01:07:33.130
[SPEAKER_20]: So when I kind of heard this was coming out for PlayStation 2, I kind of felt very the same way.

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:34.111
[SPEAKER_20]: I felt very borderline.

01:07:34.171 --> 01:07:36.553
[SPEAKER_20]: I was just kind of like, well, you know, I'm not surprised.

01:07:36.593 --> 01:07:40.736
[SPEAKER_20]: But at the same time, what's very interesting about this is that

01:07:42.034 --> 01:07:44.215
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, they're invading Konami's turf.

01:07:45.156 --> 01:07:53.201
[SPEAKER_20]: Which I think is very interesting, because we all kind of know that Konami has basically turned its back on DDR and the arcades in the US.

01:07:54.342 --> 01:08:00.365
[SPEAKER_20]: There isn't supposed to be DDR and the arcades in the US, save one crappy mix that's five, six years old at this point.

01:08:01.166 --> 01:08:02.226
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, two crappy mixes.

01:08:02.426 --> 01:08:03.547
[SPEAKER_20]: I keep forgetting about 1.5.

01:08:04.127 --> 01:08:04.728
[SPEAKER_20]: 1.5 in USA.

01:08:05.048 --> 01:08:08.230
[SPEAKER_20]: So save two crappy mixes that are god-awful years old now.

01:08:10.558 --> 01:08:11.239
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't it the same interface?

01:08:25.942 --> 01:08:26.262
[SPEAKER_20]: How so?

01:08:26.342 --> 01:08:27.163
[SPEAKER_20]: As in the arcades?

01:08:27.563 --> 01:08:28.104
[SPEAKER_20]: For In the Groove?

01:08:28.384 --> 01:08:28.584
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

01:08:29.205 --> 01:08:36.851
[SPEAKER_20]: From what we're understanding, we have not heard much to the contrary yet, but it's going to be just a freaking port of the arcade version with additions.

01:08:36.951 --> 01:08:38.973
[SPEAKER_20]: Novice level, four new songs, things like that.

01:08:39.313 --> 01:08:41.595
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to be the arcade version of In the Groove and then some.

01:08:42.876 --> 01:08:43.697
[SPEAKER_20]: Kind of neat, I guess.

01:08:46.055 --> 01:08:47.456
[SPEAKER_20]: But now they're coming on to Konami's turf.

01:08:47.956 --> 01:08:53.538
[SPEAKER_20]: So of course there's that big talk out there, Oh, Konami's gonna sue them, they're gonna sue, and they're gonna make... It depends.

01:08:53.998 --> 01:08:55.699
[SPEAKER_20]: I just, I don't see it happening at this point.

01:08:55.719 --> 01:08:57.339
[SPEAKER_20]: I think if they were gonna sue, they would've done it by now.

01:08:57.479 --> 01:08:59.860
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm really thinking that there's something going on.

01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.081
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, now, the Rockstar people and the Indie Group people have been saying this for a long time.

01:09:03.442 --> 01:09:05.622
[SPEAKER_20]: We've got our ass covered on this, don't worry.

01:09:06.383 --> 01:09:09.324
[SPEAKER_20]: But we've all been kind of sitting there going, well, they probably just have a loophole.

01:09:09.364 --> 01:09:14.886
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's kind of the assumption that, eh, they're probably sitting on some kind of loophole that, you know, they might get their shit called on eventually.

01:09:15.401 --> 01:09:16.361
[SPEAKER_20]: I just want my Pump It Up release.

01:09:41.064 --> 01:09:42.905
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be a crippled release as it is.

01:09:43.005 --> 01:09:44.866
[SPEAKER_07]: Better than getting the Korean import.

01:09:45.326 --> 01:09:45.667
[SPEAKER_20]: That's for sure.

01:09:45.687 --> 01:09:49.208
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to get the converter for the PC pad and all that crap.

01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:50.369
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, man.

01:09:56.212 --> 01:09:58.834
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kind of reading some of the feedback in the chat room.

01:09:58.854 --> 01:10:05.057
[SPEAKER_20]: If you have some feedback, www.orangelawntrader.com Click on chat and you can give us some feedback here in the chat room.

01:10:06.438 --> 01:10:07.618
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kind of looking here.

01:10:08.139 --> 01:10:08.299
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

01:10:10.382 --> 01:10:17.809
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkTest Studio says, if Konami wants to compete with In The Groove and pump it up on home consoles, they're going to have to pull out all the stops.

01:10:19.310 --> 01:10:26.216
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, what I think is interesting about that is, my assumption was always Konami could pull out one big stop in the form of a lawsuit.

01:10:27.497 --> 01:10:30.860
[SPEAKER_20]: But, obviously, they're not sitting on a loophole.

01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:35.784
[SPEAKER_20]: There's something there that is, because if Konami was going to sue, it would have happened by now.

01:10:37.006 --> 01:10:51.330
[SPEAKER_20]: Granted, maybe something could happen in the next couple weeks, as Konami could be like this announcement of In The Groove coming out really lit the fire under their ass, so now the lawyers are out, but I just somehow highly doubt it at this point.

01:10:51.751 --> 01:10:55.612
[SPEAKER_20]: It's kind of like Konami's just writing it off, which kind of irritates me in a way.

01:10:56.152 --> 01:10:57.872
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm having a check on something, by the way.

01:10:58.132 --> 01:10:58.573
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, okay.

01:10:59.973 --> 01:11:01.794
[SPEAKER_07]: Looking up intellectual property in business law.

01:11:01.814 --> 01:11:03.174
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:11:03.820 --> 01:11:07.703
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know, we could argue this till we're blue in the face.

01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.705
[SPEAKER_20]: If there's grounds for a lawsuit or not.

01:11:11.446 --> 01:11:13.107
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's two key elements missing.

01:11:13.407 --> 01:11:16.010
[SPEAKER_20]: A, we don't know if Rockstar has any secret agreements.

01:11:16.070 --> 01:11:19.973
[SPEAKER_20]: For all we know, they're slipping Konami a percentage of the profits to do this.

01:11:20.573 --> 01:11:22.955
[SPEAKER_20]: That could very well be a possibility that we're just not aware of.

01:11:25.257 --> 01:11:27.138
[SPEAKER_20]: It's doubtful, but it's a possibility.

01:11:27.158 --> 01:11:28.039
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to admit it's a possibility.

01:11:28.059 --> 01:11:30.080
[SPEAKER_20]: Because Loki's in the kitchen there going, no, no, no.

01:11:30.621 --> 01:11:31.902
[SPEAKER_20]: It's doubtful, but it's a possibility.

01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, here comes Loki.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.981
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki's got something he wants to say on this.

01:11:44.001 --> 01:11:45.022
[SPEAKER_20]: Come, here he comes.

01:11:46.022 --> 01:11:48.322
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay, here's what's actually going on here.

01:11:48.942 --> 01:12:01.124
[SPEAKER_21]: First off, the whole reason is Indigroove was basically set mania, of course, changed enough to where it wouldn't violate the copyrights that Konami had on dance games.

01:12:01.604 --> 01:12:05.085
[SPEAKER_21]: So, that would include the angle of the arrows coming up, the arrow...

01:12:05.495 --> 01:12:08.736
[SPEAKER_21]: Graphic Design, The Interface, etc.

01:12:09.696 --> 01:12:09.976
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

01:12:10.697 --> 01:12:19.820
[SPEAKER_21]: Now, hardware-wise, the thing that they were worried about as far as violating that, well, guess who has the rights to the hardware?

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:20.740
[SPEAKER_21]: That'd be Andomero.

01:12:20.840 --> 01:12:23.121
[SPEAKER_21]: Guess who's making the hardware for Indigroup 2?

01:12:23.381 --> 01:12:23.861
[SPEAKER_21]: Andomero.

01:12:23.981 --> 01:12:25.702
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, but you're talking Indigroup 2.

01:12:25.822 --> 01:12:26.962
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not talking about Indigroup 2 yet.

01:12:26.982 --> 01:12:27.982
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm talking about Indigroup 1.

01:12:28.162 --> 01:12:28.923
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay?

01:12:28.963 --> 01:12:32.904
[SPEAKER_21]: Basically saying that the rights are all taken care of and that kind of stuff.

01:12:33.621 --> 01:13:02.847
[SPEAKER_21]: as far as being able to compute DDR sure, people will buy it it's not going to do well though it's going to fail, it's going to fall hard here's why 13 footers on an ignition pad it's not going to happen hand plants on an ignition pad, it's not going to happen you know, it's just that game was designed for the arcade and the fact that difficulty level is up there you're not going to be able to utilize that part of the game on home pads on ordinary home pads, it's crazy and

01:13:04.298 --> 01:13:10.139
[SPEAKER_21]: To even get into Groove 2 a little bit, 13-footer doubles, that's ridiculous.

01:13:10.199 --> 01:13:10.859
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just stupid.

01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:13.960
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, go ahead.

01:13:14.040 --> 01:13:15.220
[SPEAKER_20]: Finish your thought, and then we'll get to Jamie.

01:13:15.480 --> 01:13:20.241
[SPEAKER_21]: But then again, you have Pump It Up, where you have hand plants and stuff on that.

01:13:20.821 --> 01:13:23.642
[SPEAKER_21]: So apparently someone likes it, and that's doing well enough.

01:13:24.002 --> 01:13:29.223
[SPEAKER_21]: And whether that's going to translate well enough into the home version, that's... I don't know.

01:13:29.503 --> 01:13:31.603
[SPEAKER_21]: But I personally...

01:13:32.761 --> 01:13:34.381
[SPEAKER_21]: Think hand plants and that kind of stuff.

01:13:34.721 --> 01:13:36.462
[SPEAKER_21]: That's not going to work well in home version.

01:13:37.582 --> 01:13:45.924
[SPEAKER_21]: You're just going to get another pretty much rip off of DDR because you're going to have the new diet version, which is in there.

01:13:46.924 --> 01:13:51.945
[SPEAKER_21]: It's basically all the modes DDR has thrown in there and renamed something different.

01:13:52.945 --> 01:13:53.165
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:13:53.465 --> 01:13:56.506
[SPEAKER_20]: I have a response to this because I feel differently, but I want to let Jamie intervene.

01:13:56.846 --> 01:13:56.986
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:13:58.223 --> 01:14:01.005
[SPEAKER_07]: I found the information I was looking for for trademark law.

01:14:01.285 --> 01:14:04.607
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to read this one paragraph because this will basically clear it up.

01:14:05.248 --> 01:14:15.654
[SPEAKER_07]: A trademark functions as a guarantee of the consistent level of certain characteristics such as quality so that the public when making a purchase will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.

01:14:16.514 --> 01:14:18.735
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, it's trademark infringement.

01:14:19.456 --> 01:14:20.456
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, purely.

01:14:21.157 --> 01:14:26.600
[SPEAKER_07]: Because In The Groove has basically everything...

01:14:27.105 --> 01:14:28.207
[SPEAKER_07]: That DDR is known for.

01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:37.001
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be like me putting out this special glass that's supposed to stay cold forever.

01:14:37.642 --> 01:14:40.787
[SPEAKER_07]: And then having another company put out exactly the same glass, but blue.

01:14:41.548 --> 01:14:41.809
[SPEAKER_07]: You know.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:43.746
[SPEAKER_20]: What about this argument?

01:14:43.766 --> 01:14:48.587
[SPEAKER_20]: Because this is a classic argument that people say about this, and we have to pay this respect.

01:14:49.047 --> 01:15:02.512
[SPEAKER_20]: What's the difference between this being one dance game to another dance game than, say, Tekken was a 3D fighter and Virtua Fighter was a 3D fighter, and they were very similar in that aspect?

01:15:03.172 --> 01:15:04.593
[SPEAKER_07]: If you play them, they are completely different.

01:15:04.946 --> 01:15:06.447
[SPEAKER_21]: First different, yeah, different engine.

01:15:06.487 --> 01:15:12.211
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just like saying what's the difference between Street Fighter and, say, Guilty Gear.

01:15:12.712 --> 01:15:17.395
[SPEAKER_07]: But In the Groove is supposed to play just like DDR, basically, right?

01:15:17.415 --> 01:15:22.999
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the thing that always weirded me out about In the Groove is that it was specifically made for DDR cabinets.

01:15:23.520 --> 01:15:25.801
[SPEAKER_20]: That always kind of sat weird with me.

01:15:26.202 --> 01:15:31.706
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, granted, I realize this is all changing with In the Groove, but again, In the Groove 2, we haven't gone there yet.

01:15:32.432 --> 01:15:33.453
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm still talking about End of Group 1.

01:15:33.713 --> 01:15:34.774
[SPEAKER_21]: And you know what's funny?

01:15:35.094 --> 01:15:35.354
[SPEAKER_21]: What?

01:15:35.835 --> 01:15:37.816
[SPEAKER_21]: And I have to laugh because it's coming.

01:15:38.637 --> 01:15:45.322
[SPEAKER_21]: You don't think that they're going to stop... You know, they're basically taking everything Konami has stopped supporting and they're supporting it further.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:47.103
[SPEAKER_21]: You watch...

01:15:47.697 --> 01:16:00.343
[SPEAKER_21]: and I guarantee you probably by the end of this year you're going to see 5 key versions of something like In The Groove that's going to be supporting for all those old Beatmania cabinets that no longer can get upgrades because Beatmania the final came out and that was it.

01:16:00.663 --> 01:16:02.984
[SPEAKER_21]: You're going to have a new 5 key game that's going to be coming out and

01:16:03.924 --> 01:16:07.265
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know about Dance Maniacs, but Dance Maniacs could be another step too.

01:16:07.446 --> 01:16:08.206
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting thought.

01:16:08.266 --> 01:16:08.546
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie?

01:16:08.666 --> 01:16:10.027
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a little bit more on this one.

01:16:12.087 --> 01:16:15.529
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, trademarks are considered property and protected as property.

01:16:16.289 --> 01:16:19.890
[SPEAKER_07]: Trademark infringement should be prevented as a type of unfair competition.

01:16:20.771 --> 01:16:24.212
[SPEAKER_07]: Further, trademark infringement violates the standards of commercial morality.

01:16:24.632 --> 01:16:29.314
[SPEAKER_07]: Additionally, trademarks require protection as they represent an investment in goodwill.

01:16:29.794 --> 01:16:32.859
[SPEAKER_07]: with the law behind protecting the interests of the trademark owners.

01:16:33.219 --> 01:16:36.023
[SPEAKER_07]: Infringers are prevented from free writing on the efforts of others.

01:16:38.026 --> 01:16:39.128
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what I wanted to point out.

01:16:39.188 --> 01:16:44.476
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, again, this in the groove thing is basically writing on the coattails of Konami for DDR.

01:16:45.137 --> 01:16:46.318
[SPEAKER_07]: There's another one on here too.

01:16:47.299 --> 01:16:53.045
[SPEAKER_07]: Infringement of trademark falls below the minimum level of fair competition the government enforces in marketplace.

01:16:53.585 --> 01:16:56.708
[SPEAKER_07]: Infringement of trademarks is but an aspect of unfair competition.

01:16:56.748 --> 01:17:00.692
[SPEAKER_07]: Since unfair competition is a tort, trademark infringement is a tort as well.

01:17:00.732 --> 01:17:02.514
[SPEAKER_07]: And for people who don't know, tort is a wrong.

01:17:03.855 --> 01:17:05.076
[SPEAKER_07]: A lawbreak, basically.

01:17:06.017 --> 01:17:07.459
[SPEAKER_07]: Doing something you're not supposed to do.

01:17:08.314 --> 01:17:15.159
[SPEAKER_20]: But now, the thing is, despite whether the law may or may not be in Konami's favor, because again, there could be a secret agreement we don't know about.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:16.240
[SPEAKER_20]: Could be.

01:17:19.062 --> 01:17:28.449
[SPEAKER_20]: Even if there was some legal thing that says Konami's in the right with this or whatever, if Konami just doesn't do anything about it, we're talking until we're blue in the face here, right?

01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:31.131
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's up to Konami if they want to pursue it.

01:17:31.672 --> 01:17:33.253
[SPEAKER_07]: But regardless, you know...

01:17:34.272 --> 01:17:35.753
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, here's my perspective though.

01:17:35.893 --> 01:17:38.915
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki says In The Groove doesn't think it's going to do well at home.

01:17:39.515 --> 01:17:40.015
[SPEAKER_20]: I disagree.

01:17:40.176 --> 01:17:44.318
[SPEAKER_20]: I think In The Groove stands to do very well in the home market, and there's one reason why.

01:17:46.599 --> 01:17:47.500
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I guess you're right.

01:17:47.520 --> 01:17:48.460
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a couple reasons why.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:53.884
[SPEAKER_20]: A, if the price is right, we don't know what the price is yet, but imagine if In The Groove goes for $20.

01:17:55.219 --> 01:17:56.941
[SPEAKER_20]: And sadly, people are fooled by cheap knockoffs.

01:18:09.989 --> 01:18:10.370
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:11.691
[SPEAKER_20]: But here's the other thing.

01:18:11.851 --> 01:18:16.476
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's the reason why the Mad Catz GameCube thing... Yeah, why are the Mad Catz products selling?

01:18:16.496 --> 01:18:18.599
[SPEAKER_20]: No, the Mad Catz GameCube game, that's why that failed.

01:18:18.639 --> 01:18:19.880
[SPEAKER_20]: Because the price was wrong on that.

01:18:20.120 --> 01:18:21.382
[SPEAKER_20]: And you had to have a special pad for it.

01:18:21.422 --> 01:18:22.763
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no way they were going to make that cheap.

01:18:22.783 --> 01:18:26.507
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm talking about their dance pads and all the third-party pads that were so crappy.

01:18:27.468 --> 01:18:28.630
[SPEAKER_20]: You bring me to my other point, though.

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:31.433
[SPEAKER_20]: Red Octane has a lock...

01:18:32.217 --> 01:18:33.858
[SPEAKER_20]: on the home market for dance pads.

01:18:33.999 --> 01:18:34.599
[SPEAKER_20]: They really do.

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.784
[SPEAKER_20]: Most people that are into dance games know that Red Octane produces the best home pads.

01:18:41.224 --> 01:18:46.909
[SPEAKER_20]: And stores like GameStop, EB Games, Fry's, whatever, carry tons of the Red Octane pads.

01:18:47.549 --> 01:18:49.290
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Fulton and Marconi.

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:50.131
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes.

01:18:52.393 --> 01:18:52.953
[SPEAKER_20]: But remember this.

01:18:53.113 --> 01:18:55.655
[SPEAKER_20]: Red Octane is now the one that's going to be putting out in the groove.

01:18:56.676 --> 01:19:01.560
[SPEAKER_20]: So what's going to stop them from putting on every box of these dance pads, you know,

01:19:02.259 --> 01:19:05.220
[SPEAKER_20]: for use with games such as In The Groove.

01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.861
[SPEAKER_20]: Buy In The Groove in stores now.

01:19:08.361 --> 01:19:09.381
[SPEAKER_20]: In The Groove this, In The Groove that.

01:19:09.842 --> 01:19:16.784
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be this automatic partnership between the biggest selling dance pad and now this new game.

01:19:16.884 --> 01:19:24.126
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the only way we're going to get somewhat of a straight answer is start looking for a press release from Konami or start contacting their reps.

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:26.687
[SPEAKER_20]: Ask the question.

01:19:26.967 --> 01:19:28.428
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you remember we had the...

01:19:29.884 --> 01:19:38.986
[SPEAKER_20]: We had the lost interview with Jason Enos that we did at E3 last year and we didn't end up getting to play it on the station because things happened and it didn't end up getting saved.

01:19:40.307 --> 01:19:45.648
[SPEAKER_20]: But Loki actually dropped the bomb and he asked straight up, he said, what do you think of In the Groove?

01:19:46.908 --> 01:19:52.550
[SPEAKER_20]: And the answer we got was kind of, it was very politically correct middle ground kind of, you know,

01:19:53.097 --> 01:19:54.858
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:20:23.652 --> 01:20:24.653
[SPEAKER_20]: God, I wish we had that.

01:20:24.753 --> 01:20:27.034
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, I'm so mad that that didn't end up happening.

01:20:27.994 --> 01:20:35.018
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't you find it a little funny that it being a couple months away from E3, we haven't heard anything about a new DDR game yet?

01:20:37.420 --> 01:20:42.343
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I firmly believe they are going to throw out the punches at E3.

01:20:42.903 --> 01:20:44.464
[SPEAKER_20]: I think E3, they will announce all of them.

01:20:45.684 --> 01:20:49.367
[SPEAKER_20]: I firmly believe there will be another one for Xbox and another one for PlayStation.

01:20:49.807 --> 01:20:51.908
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think they're going to do DDR Mario here in the U.S.

01:20:53.291 --> 01:21:20.753
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're going to be rolling out new dance games on all three platforms and a certain website of a certain artist that we interviewed said that he might have an involvement with it but of course he can't say anything other than that interesting I didn't know about that I posted the link to the trademark infringement site in the chat room for anybody who is at all interested in knowing the legal background behind it very nice

01:21:21.888 --> 01:21:24.191
[SPEAKER_20]: See, you can educate yourself here on Renaissance Radio.

01:21:24.231 --> 01:21:27.935
[SPEAKER_07]: I still think that we need to buy Konami stocks so that we have a say in the company and stockholders.

01:21:27.955 --> 01:21:29.256
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know, we need to do that.

01:21:31.398 --> 01:21:35.462
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's interesting, but this is the interesting thing now that I see here.

01:21:35.542 --> 01:21:43.330
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, this is kind of, and I'm sorry we're kind of talking about this until we're blue in the face, but, you know, we are a show about rhythm and music games, and this is it right here.

01:21:44.589 --> 01:21:45.630
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for watching!

01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:09.441
[SPEAKER_20]: This is just another one that sort of jumped off at me as I was trying to go to another site.

01:22:28.749 --> 01:22:32.410
[SPEAKER_07]: It was about the use of infringing marks in interstate commerce.

01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:37.471
[SPEAKER_07]: It says, any commercial activity that Congress can regulate is subject to the Lanham Act.

01:22:38.331 --> 01:22:50.193
[SPEAKER_07]: Lanham Act considers an infringing mark used in commerce when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce or the services are rendered in more than one state.

01:22:50.613 --> 01:22:54.854
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're basically trying to spread this.

01:22:56.095 --> 01:23:06.243
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, we've had... The arcade version's been in a very small area, but you start bringing out a home release, and that's going to be pretty much, you know, countrywide.

01:23:09.406 --> 01:23:11.567
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a feeling that Konami's going to do something about it.

01:23:12.668 --> 01:23:17.732
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to affect their sales in such a way, they're going to see this as taking money out of their pocket.

01:23:18.033 --> 01:23:23.617
[SPEAKER_20]: I think E3's going to be hilarious this year, because all these dance games are going to be shown.

01:23:24.518 --> 01:23:24.598
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

01:23:25.367 --> 01:23:26.548
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so looking forward to it.

01:23:26.888 --> 01:23:29.550
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's going to be a showdown, and I can't wait.

01:23:30.330 --> 01:23:32.091
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'll be podcasting.

01:23:32.251 --> 01:23:33.532
[SPEAKER_20]: You've got to get on our podcast.

01:23:33.572 --> 01:23:36.654
[SPEAKER_20]: We will be podcasting if I get to go, which I'm pretty sure I will.

01:23:37.374 --> 01:23:42.638
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be podcasting every day from E3, and we will bring it to you as it happens, as the drama unfolds at E3.

01:23:43.098 --> 01:23:43.558
[SPEAKER_20]: You betcha.

01:23:44.999 --> 01:23:46.260
[SPEAKER_07]: I will have the laptop with me.

01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:46.900
[SPEAKER_20]: That's right.

01:23:47.120 --> 01:23:49.322
[SPEAKER_07]: We can update the site.

01:23:49.362 --> 01:23:50.723
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have the orange box.

01:23:52.284 --> 01:23:52.864
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll have it all.

01:23:54.153 --> 01:23:57.734
[SPEAKER_20]: A lot of gaming sites will not be able to bring you the news as fast as we're going to be bringing it to you.

01:23:58.314 --> 01:23:58.834
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be awesome.

01:23:58.854 --> 01:24:00.495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just because we're awesome and we're cool.

01:24:01.075 --> 01:24:07.076
[SPEAKER_20]: We are dedicated to spreading the E3 drama throughout the world this year.

01:24:07.236 --> 01:24:08.696
[SPEAKER_07]: Other sites want to be us.

01:24:12.297 --> 01:24:12.617
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:24:13.858 --> 01:24:22.880
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, Jamie, I would encourage you at some point this week or so, go down and give In The Groove a try.

01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:23.640
[SPEAKER_20]: See what you think.

01:24:25.482 --> 01:24:26.943
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe when my lungs work again.

01:24:27.383 --> 01:24:29.564
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, I guess that would kind of slow me down too.

01:24:30.245 --> 01:24:41.392
[SPEAKER_07]: And when, you know, CCL is in the, you know, money-stealing sack of... I'm telling you, Wednesday night, nobody's there because everybody's at Roseville Golf Line because of the arcade mania.

01:24:41.952 --> 01:24:42.973
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, I know.

01:24:43.553 --> 01:24:44.254
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel, you had a comment?

01:24:45.555 --> 01:24:47.156
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd go if you guys want to go over there.

01:24:47.196 --> 01:24:50.097
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, maybe like piling in the car and be like, okay.

01:24:50.538 --> 01:24:50.938
Yeah.

01:24:52.694 --> 01:24:54.715
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, I'm probably going to go again this Wednesday, so we'll see.

01:24:55.375 --> 01:25:00.676
[SPEAKER_06]: The only reason I'm saying that is because I haven't seen it yet, and I just wanted to see it for myself, and, you know, why not?

01:25:02.017 --> 01:25:04.478
[SPEAKER_06]: Then you have another voice going, no, just kidding.

01:25:05.978 --> 01:25:11.240
[SPEAKER_20]: I just don't want people out there going, you know, oh, Sky doesn't know what the hell he's talking about because he's never played in the groove.

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:14.621
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I've played it, so I think I speak.

01:25:14.941 --> 01:25:16.141
[SPEAKER_20]: And I don't hate in the groove.

01:25:16.761 --> 01:25:19.342
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they've got a lot of good ideas.

01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:44.695
[SPEAKER_20]: and I think there's a lot of good things about In the Groove so please, don't get me wrong I probably will buy In the Groove on PlayStation 2 because I I won't spend my money on it I have to disagree I probably will buy it depending on what happens with Konami depending on what happens there but if Konami continues to do nothing then I will buy In the Groove on PlayStation 2 I'm not going to give them my money

01:25:46.604 --> 01:25:50.426
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't support poor rip-offs, so they don't get my money.

01:25:51.387 --> 01:25:52.768
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, let's have to agree to disagree there.

01:25:53.848 --> 01:25:55.289
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to go to break.

01:25:55.329 --> 01:25:57.710
[SPEAKER_20]: When we come back, we're going to talk a little bit about... Oh, Loki, Loki?

01:25:58.251 --> 01:26:01.032
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't support poor rip-offs as well.

01:26:01.372 --> 01:26:08.536
[SPEAKER_21]: However, if anyone out there in the group game is willing to rip the hard drive... You don't support the legit copies either, okay?

01:26:09.197 --> 01:26:11.798
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I would rather HG load it and steal money from them.

01:26:11.818 --> 01:26:12.499
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be awesome.

01:26:13.239 --> 01:26:14.940
[SPEAKER_07]: And remember, kick an Ultra K machine.

01:26:16.252 --> 01:26:16.612
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

01:26:21.136 --> 01:26:26.520
[SPEAKER_20]: When we get back from this next break, I want to talk a little bit about In The Groove 2, because we've got news on that.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:37.488
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, I know, but DarkSakura, I realize you may have this kind of towards In The Groove right now, but let's face it, they're the only ones doing anything right now.

01:26:42.171 --> 01:26:44.573
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back.

01:26:45.618 --> 01:26:50.079
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I'm going to open up the Skype line because I know somebody out there is going to want to comment on this.

01:26:50.359 --> 01:26:51.079
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll do that.

01:26:51.580 --> 01:26:53.420
[SPEAKER_20]: And then we're going to get into the Orange Lodge Radio Cage Match.

01:26:53.460 --> 01:26:56.561
[SPEAKER_20]: So more fun to be had when we come back from this break.

01:26:57.181 --> 01:27:01.422
[SPEAKER_20]: And Elmo had suggested we do a themed break of calendar songs.

01:27:02.402 --> 01:27:03.663
[SPEAKER_20]: So we're going to do some calendar songs.

01:27:03.683 --> 01:27:04.623
[SPEAKER_20]: And we'll be back after this.

01:27:29.285 --> 01:27:30.108
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

01:28:00.942 --> 01:28:02.503
You've got to breathe your mind

01:28:56.157 --> 01:28:56.805
Thanks for watching!

01:30:46.169 --> 01:30:47.091
Thanks for watching!

01:31:26.434 --> 01:31:26.616
Thank you.

01:31:57.086 --> 01:31:58.044
Thanks for watching!

01:32:29.157 --> 01:32:30.019
Thanks for watching!

01:33:19.797 --> 01:33:20.744
Thanks for watching!

01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:56.101
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:33:56.161 --> 01:34:01.782
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, we've been talking about In the Groove, which is something that is really kind of

01:34:22.208 --> 01:34:23.450
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:34:37.785 --> 01:34:40.666
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I can see why people feel about this.

01:34:40.927 --> 01:34:45.088
[SPEAKER_20]: Real quick, I want to go around, take a poll, see how people stand on In The Groove.

01:34:45.108 --> 01:34:47.269
[SPEAKER_20]: I just kind of want to go around, see what people think of this.

01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:51.331
[SPEAKER_20]: Love the idea, hate the idea, undecided, or what you stand.

01:34:51.351 --> 01:34:52.771
[SPEAKER_20]: Just kind of like a quick couple sentences.

01:34:52.851 --> 01:34:56.073
[SPEAKER_20]: So, Jamie, you want to start?

01:34:56.193 --> 01:34:56.893
[SPEAKER_20]: Your thoughts on In The Groove?

01:34:57.013 --> 01:34:57.513
[SPEAKER_06]: Lung cookie.

01:34:58.194 --> 01:34:58.694
[SPEAKER_20]: Lung cookie.

01:34:59.154 --> 01:34:59.394
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel?

01:35:00.895 --> 01:35:03.916
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea since I haven't seen it yet, but maybe that'll change by Wednesday.

01:35:03.936 --> 01:35:04.016
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:35:06.721 --> 01:35:13.183
[SPEAKER_20]: I am still... The longer that they... How do I phrase this?

01:35:14.763 --> 01:35:27.085
[SPEAKER_20]: The fact that they are doing this, that they're putting this out on the home console, and the fact that the folks who make the game are out there in the community and being awfully persistent about all this, kind of actually raises my opinion of the whole thing a little bit.

01:35:27.686 --> 01:35:31.066
[SPEAKER_20]: It makes me feel like they really do want to try and do some good here.

01:35:31.386 --> 01:35:34.447
[SPEAKER_20]: I find the whole thing interesting.

01:35:35.163 --> 01:35:39.166
[SPEAKER_20]: The game itself, I'm still, you know, I think there's good things and bad things about it.

01:35:40.207 --> 01:35:41.128
[SPEAKER_20]: It's an okay game.

01:35:41.688 --> 01:35:44.510
[SPEAKER_20]: I welcome it, but I have concerns.

01:35:45.451 --> 01:35:48.173
[SPEAKER_20]: That's my long-sorted, blown-up answer.

01:35:49.073 --> 01:35:52.616
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian42, who joined us during the last break there.

01:35:52.656 --> 01:35:53.697
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, friend, how are you?

01:35:53.717 --> 01:35:54.698
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing okay.

01:35:55.038 --> 01:35:57.200
[SPEAKER_20]: So, you walked into our big discussion on Indie Groove.

01:35:57.480 --> 01:35:57.960
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think?

01:35:59.141 --> 01:35:59.641
[SPEAKER_05]: It's okay.

01:35:59.741 --> 01:36:04.385
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't played it, so I can't really comment on the gameplay, but hey, if they're coming out with it...

01:36:05.513 --> 01:36:06.194
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine by me.

01:36:06.314 --> 01:36:06.955
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, why not?

01:36:07.315 --> 01:36:08.516
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's kind of Arcadian Sea.

01:36:08.536 --> 01:36:09.137
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, why not?

01:36:09.597 --> 01:36:10.217
[SPEAKER_20]: Hey, why not?

01:36:11.078 --> 01:36:11.499
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

01:36:11.759 --> 01:36:12.359
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to buy it?

01:36:13.100 --> 01:36:13.981
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki says hate it.

01:36:14.021 --> 01:36:14.862
[SPEAKER_20]: He's yelling from the kitchen.

01:36:14.882 --> 01:36:15.963
[SPEAKER_20]: We hated it.

01:36:17.024 --> 01:36:17.424
Hated it.

01:36:18.925 --> 01:36:19.386
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:36:20.246 --> 01:36:21.488
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to open up the Skype.

01:36:21.508 --> 01:36:21.908
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like that.

01:36:22.344 --> 01:36:26.487
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to open up the Skype line for you guys, but we need to get to this bit first.

01:36:26.587 --> 01:36:31.851
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I know somebody will bring this up on the Skype line, so we want to mention this.

01:36:33.232 --> 01:36:37.435
[SPEAKER_20]: So that you guys kind of know everything before we just open up the Skype line.

01:36:37.475 --> 01:36:40.557
[SPEAKER_20]: Those of you guys that get most of your Bomani news here on this show.

01:36:40.617 --> 01:36:44.560
[SPEAKER_20]: Which actually, there are some people who pretty much get most of their Bomani news here on this show.

01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.502
[SPEAKER_20]: In the Groove 2 is happening.

01:36:48.621 --> 01:36:49.161
[SPEAKER_20]: It is happening.

01:36:49.181 --> 01:36:49.922
[SPEAKER_20]: It is coming out.

01:36:50.302 --> 01:36:54.205
[SPEAKER_20]: They showed it at the Amusement Showcase International 2005 show.

01:36:54.625 --> 01:36:56.966
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the interesting thing about In the Groove 2.

01:36:57.146 --> 01:36:58.887
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, there's several interesting things about In the Groove 2.

01:36:59.728 --> 01:37:01.389
[SPEAKER_20]: A, brand new cabinet.

01:37:02.069 --> 01:37:05.371
[SPEAKER_20]: So no longer will In the Groove be stowing away.

01:37:06.172 --> 01:37:06.912
[SPEAKER_20]: Not necessarily.

01:37:07.433 --> 01:37:09.254
[SPEAKER_20]: You'll be doing upgrades for regular cabinets too?

01:37:09.274 --> 01:37:09.354
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:37:09.795 --> 01:37:10.135
[SPEAKER_20]: InTheGroove1.com

01:37:37.757 --> 01:37:45.383
[SPEAKER_20]: And then there's going to be some brand new songs in the groove too as well.

01:37:45.864 --> 01:37:51.849
[SPEAKER_20]: Which include Typical Tropical by Bambi from DDR Solo, which you first heard that.

01:37:52.409 --> 01:38:01.076
[SPEAKER_20]: Spaceman by Lin, who... Now that's the weird thing because Spaceman was actually a Bambi song, so we're not quite sure why the title changed there.

01:38:01.436 --> 01:38:02.437
[SPEAKER_20]: Perhaps it's a...

01:38:05.068 --> 01:38:05.708
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, maybe not.

01:38:05.748 --> 01:38:11.251
[SPEAKER_20]: It could be a cover or it could be an artist went solo or something.

01:38:11.291 --> 01:38:11.691
[SPEAKER_20]: Who knows?

01:38:11.871 --> 01:38:12.291
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:38:12.371 --> 01:38:14.732
[SPEAKER_20]: But regardless, Spaceman's going to be in there.

01:38:15.413 --> 01:38:19.274
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's one of the songs that's in rotation on our station right now, actually.

01:38:20.555 --> 01:38:23.236
[SPEAKER_20]: And then, what was the one?

01:38:23.356 --> 01:38:28.078
[SPEAKER_20]: Sunshine by Triple J. You know this is Follow the Sun from DDR, third mix.

01:38:29.098 --> 01:38:33.620
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, of course, I'm blatantly mentioning the songs that seem to be crossing over from the games we already know.

01:38:34.040 --> 01:38:35.240
[SPEAKER_20]: There's a whole list.

01:38:35.260 --> 01:38:38.541
[SPEAKER_20]: There's already announced 50 new songs.

01:38:38.661 --> 01:38:41.062
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't see a whole lot else that really caught my attention.

01:38:41.642 --> 01:38:50.765
[SPEAKER_20]: Little Kitty Mine, I thought that was interesting because that's by Nini, who did a lot of the Dance Mania songs, as well as Spacey Crazy Girl by Nini is going to be in it as well, and The Message.

01:38:51.405 --> 01:38:54.366
[SPEAKER_20]: Some new Ka songs, those of you guys that like him, he's kind of the Naoki.

01:38:55.366 --> 01:38:58.307
[SPEAKER_20]: Twilight, Tribal Style, some new songs there.

01:39:00.528 --> 01:39:01.309
[SPEAKER_20]: Very interesting.

01:39:03.290 --> 01:39:05.151
[SPEAKER_20]: So those are some new songs that are going to be in In The Groove 2.

01:39:06.011 --> 01:39:09.013
[SPEAKER_20]: In The Groove 2 has a very red interface.

01:39:10.674 --> 01:39:13.555
[SPEAKER_20]: People are noticing not a whole lot of huge changes.

01:39:16.037 --> 01:39:21.940
[SPEAKER_20]: But Novice Mode being one big change and just the cabinet and the new songs being another change as well.

01:39:23.260 --> 01:39:24.101
[SPEAKER_20]: Very interesting.

01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:47.796
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so, what we're going to do now, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so if you want to talk to us, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can call in on the Skype line, because I know some folks have very deep-lying opinions on this, so I'm very curious to hear what some of our listeners have to say.

01:39:48.236 --> 01:39:49.496
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:39:50.569 --> 01:39:50.789
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi.

01:39:51.229 --> 01:39:51.770
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, who's this?

01:39:52.730 --> 01:39:54.551
[SPEAKER_15]: Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.

01:39:54.671 --> 01:39:55.852
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, Sephiroth1215.

01:39:56.152 --> 01:39:57.633
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, this is your first time calling, isn't it?

01:39:57.753 --> 01:39:58.534
[SPEAKER_20]: Or first or second?

01:40:00.115 --> 01:40:01.135
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, this is my first time.

01:40:01.435 --> 01:40:02.356
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, newbie.

01:40:02.856 --> 01:40:03.456
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, newbie.

01:40:03.516 --> 01:40:03.957
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

01:40:04.897 --> 01:40:06.658
[SPEAKER_20]: What are your thoughts on In The Groove?

01:40:08.279 --> 01:40:14.123
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually think it's not that bad, just because DDR is kind of going downhill now.

01:40:15.403 --> 01:40:16.604
[SPEAKER_15]: So you think DDR is going downhill?

01:40:16.624 --> 01:40:16.664
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

01:40:17.958 --> 01:40:20.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, but this might be bringing it back up, hopefully.

01:40:21.239 --> 01:40:24.459
[SPEAKER_20]: What about DDR do you think is going downhill?

01:40:24.759 --> 01:40:28.780
[SPEAKER_20]: Do you think that DDR Extreme on PlayStation was the wrong direction, or what?

01:40:30.100 --> 01:40:31.120
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh yeah, most definitely.

01:40:31.601 --> 01:40:33.701
[SPEAKER_20]: So you weren't a fan of the recent home releases?

01:40:35.341 --> 01:40:44.703
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, you know, I like, the song list wasn't bad, it's just all the bugs and the interface especially really sucked.

01:40:46.122 --> 01:41:03.250
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you know, it's interesting because I kind of feel like, whereas DDR Extreme for PlayStation, this is just me personally, whereas I think DDR Extreme on PlayStation could have been a little bit better, I think there were some areas for improvement there, I think Ultramix 2 fucking swapped, just knocked the house down.

01:41:03.570 --> 01:41:05.731
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought it was a great DDR release, but...

01:41:07.425 --> 01:41:09.507
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't feel the same on Ultramix 2?

01:41:09.547 --> 01:41:12.189
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, actually I do.

01:41:12.269 --> 01:41:19.816
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, it seems like Konami doesn't seem to really do much about Hawaii over there.

01:41:20.177 --> 01:41:26.823
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, if they let them do, if they did the PS2 mixes even, it would be great.

01:41:27.644 --> 01:41:31.868
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I understand that, because Ultramix 2 kind of feels like the sideshow at the circus, doesn't it?

01:41:32.842 --> 01:41:34.583
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though it deserves to be on the main stage.

01:41:34.824 --> 01:41:41.148
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like when you go to one of those big festivals like Lollapalooza or something and the best band you see all day is playing on the second stage.

01:41:41.508 --> 01:41:43.770
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of how Ultramix 2 is right now.

01:41:44.811 --> 01:41:46.172
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I feel the same way.

01:41:46.212 --> 01:41:59.642
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, Ultramix 2 is great and if they just pay more attention to it... Yeah, the first words out of my mouth after I played Ultramix 2 was Konami of Hawaii should be doing the next DDR release in the arcades.

01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:16.475
[SPEAKER_20]: and I still think that but I yeah exactly they should not that my opinion matters any or your opinion when it comes to you know the big picture over there whatever the suits are thinking at Konami but hey if it were up to me Hawaii would be working on a new arcade mix right now and we'd have tons of different drum songs in it

01:42:17.835 --> 01:42:30.042
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I just feel that Hawaii kind of stays more to us fans instead of, you know, the PS2 mixes, which tries to bring along more newcomers with all these songs that everybody knows.

01:42:30.322 --> 01:42:30.723
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

01:42:30.763 --> 01:42:31.423
[SPEAKER_20]: I can see that, too.

01:42:31.463 --> 01:42:33.924
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, a lot of fans worked on Ultramix, too.

01:42:33.964 --> 01:42:37.927
[SPEAKER_20]: A really good friend of the show's, or a couple of them, were working on Ultramix, too.

01:42:38.067 --> 01:42:40.068
[SPEAKER_20]: So that was kind of neat that they got to be a part of that.

01:42:40.128 --> 01:42:40.368
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:42:41.369 --> 01:42:41.589
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

01:42:42.810 --> 01:42:44.491
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, so back to In The Groove for a minute.

01:42:44.511 --> 01:42:46.452
[SPEAKER_20]: Have you actually gotten a chance to play In The Groove?

01:42:46.472 --> 01:42:50.695
[SPEAKER_20]: Or are you just kind of watching all this debate going on from the sidelines, just trying to keep an open mind?

01:42:51.836 --> 01:42:57.419
[SPEAKER_15]: I watched it, and after that I downloaded all the sim files for them and played them.

01:42:58.259 --> 01:42:59.660
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, the songs aren't too bad.

01:43:00.140 --> 01:43:02.582
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, some of the steps are kind of ridiculous, though.

01:43:03.923 --> 01:43:07.084
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, some of the expert stuff's a little ridiculous.

01:43:07.204 --> 01:43:08.425
[SPEAKER_20]: I can certainly agree with that.

01:43:08.785 --> 01:43:09.766
[SPEAKER_20]: But I've got to tell you, though,

01:43:10.330 --> 01:43:16.218
[SPEAKER_20]: Downloading it and playing it on StepMania and actually playing it inside an arcade machine, it's very different.

01:43:16.639 --> 01:43:20.905
[SPEAKER_20]: StepMania does not have the same feel in an arcade machine that it does on the home.

01:43:21.826 --> 01:43:24.590
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know how to explain it, it's just kind of the way I see it, so...

01:43:25.987 --> 01:43:31.071
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, yeah, there is one in the area that hopefully I get to play someday soon, but... All right, well... Until then.

01:43:31.711 --> 01:43:33.413
[SPEAKER_20]: Until then, just kind of watching the debate.

01:43:33.433 --> 01:43:38.937
[SPEAKER_20]: So you just kind of think that in the groove, it's just something new, and so why not?

01:43:39.637 --> 01:43:40.538
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that kind of what I'm hearing?

01:43:41.318 --> 01:43:52.387
[SPEAKER_15]: At first, I kind of didn't care about it too much, but, I mean, Red Octane is putting it out there, and they've been pretty good with their pads and everything, so I'm sure...

01:43:53.137 --> 01:43:56.620
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:44:11.034 --> 01:44:14.175
[SPEAKER_20]: Five Key Controllers and other sorts of knockoffs for various games too.

01:44:14.215 --> 01:44:15.355
[SPEAKER_20]: I think what you said is right on.

01:44:15.415 --> 01:44:20.036
[SPEAKER_20]: If In The Groove does well, we're going to start seeing a Five Key be made again.

01:44:20.196 --> 01:44:21.556
[SPEAKER_21]: They've already said they're going to do it.

01:44:21.996 --> 01:44:22.916
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a surprise.

01:44:22.976 --> 01:44:24.456
[SPEAKER_21]: They've already said they were going to do it.

01:44:26.277 --> 01:44:26.737
[SPEAKER_21]: It'll come.

01:44:27.677 --> 01:44:28.137
[SPEAKER_21]: You watch.

01:44:30.877 --> 01:44:34.678
[SPEAKER_15]: If they could beat Konami to beat Mania in the US, they'll definitely own that.

01:44:36.238 --> 01:44:39.439
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just going to be interesting to see how long will Konami just sit and watch this happen.

01:44:41.363 --> 01:44:43.304
[SPEAKER_15]: Maybe they probably just don't care as much.

01:44:43.764 --> 01:44:44.045
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe.

01:44:44.345 --> 01:44:45.145
[SPEAKER_20]: This is kind of sad.

01:44:45.185 --> 01:44:45.506
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:44:46.506 --> 01:44:47.947
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like I'm not important.

01:44:47.987 --> 01:44:49.588
[SPEAKER_19]: I feel like Konami doesn't love me.

01:44:49.988 --> 01:44:51.489
[SPEAKER_19]: Konami won't stand up for me.

01:44:51.849 --> 01:44:53.670
[SPEAKER_19]: Mom, I'm being picked on at school.

01:44:53.771 --> 01:44:56.912
[SPEAKER_19]: Why won't you say anything to the principal about it?

01:44:57.273 --> 01:44:58.113
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of how I feel.

01:45:01.675 --> 01:45:03.056
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, any other thoughts on the group?

01:45:05.358 --> 01:45:05.758
[SPEAKER_15]: Not really.

01:45:05.818 --> 01:45:08.339
[SPEAKER_15]: I understand you probably have many more callers, so...

01:45:09.924 --> 01:45:10.444
[SPEAKER_20]: Not really.

01:45:10.464 --> 01:45:11.705
[SPEAKER_20]: We're not that popular of a show.

01:45:11.765 --> 01:45:12.886
[SPEAKER_20]: Not a lot of people listen to us.

01:45:14.006 --> 01:45:15.807
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to let you go now, just in case.

01:45:16.547 --> 01:45:17.688
[SPEAKER_20]: We should open the line back up.

01:45:19.489 --> 01:45:20.169
[SPEAKER_20]: Thanks for your call.

01:45:21.010 --> 01:45:21.670
[SPEAKER_15]: Have a good one.

01:45:22.510 --> 01:45:22.791
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

01:45:24.371 --> 01:45:25.912
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good to hear from new people once in a while.

01:45:27.393 --> 01:45:28.554
[SPEAKER_20]: It's good to hear from him.

01:45:29.034 --> 01:45:31.135
[SPEAKER_20]: Darn it, I hung up on the person who tried to call in next.

01:45:31.155 --> 01:45:31.495
[SPEAKER_20]: There he is.

01:45:31.915 --> 01:45:33.156
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:45:34.383 --> 01:45:35.443
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, this is Al Mullet.

01:45:35.623 --> 01:45:37.344
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, sorry for hanging up on you there.

01:45:37.364 --> 01:45:38.604
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the best name ever.

01:45:38.664 --> 01:45:42.345
[SPEAKER_20]: I was trying to hang up on my last caller, and I accidentally hung up on you instead.

01:45:42.985 --> 01:45:43.806
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, no problems.

01:45:44.026 --> 01:45:44.746
[SPEAKER_04]: I get that a lot.

01:45:44.946 --> 01:45:45.866
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, what's on your mind, buddy?

01:45:47.227 --> 01:45:48.527
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you're talking about In the Groove.

01:45:48.587 --> 01:45:50.187
[SPEAKER_04]: I figured I'll talk about In the Groove.

01:45:50.288 --> 01:45:57.910
[SPEAKER_20]: I would love to hear your thoughts on In the Groove, because you made a great post on the DDR Freak thread about In the Groove, so I definitely want to hear it.

01:45:58.230 --> 01:45:59.010
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to hear your thoughts.

01:45:59.714 --> 01:46:03.596
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, I can't hate in the groove because I haven't played in the groove.

01:46:03.636 --> 01:46:05.476
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no machine in Maryland and nothing.

01:46:05.596 --> 01:46:10.258
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to cross state lines in order to play a dancing game.

01:46:10.318 --> 01:46:10.779
[SPEAKER_20]: Hold on, though.

01:46:10.799 --> 01:46:22.523
[SPEAKER_20]: Before you talk about that you can't hate in the groove for that reason, I think there is still reason to hate in the groove, even if you haven't played it, because of the fact that it's kind of like it's invading DDR's turf.

01:46:23.424 --> 01:46:27.445
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like the Crips are coming into the Bloods' territory, and you're going to pull a knife on them.

01:46:29.122 --> 01:46:30.243
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, I'm going to get into that.

01:46:30.463 --> 01:46:31.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I'm sorry.

01:46:32.184 --> 01:46:32.984
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry, Emily.

01:46:33.004 --> 01:46:33.625
[SPEAKER_20]: Go ahead and finish that.

01:46:33.745 --> 01:46:34.225
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay.

01:46:34.245 --> 01:46:37.187
[SPEAKER_04]: The second half of the sentence is that I hate the fan base.

01:46:37.827 --> 01:46:39.328
[SPEAKER_04]: They are psychotic.

01:46:42.950 --> 01:46:50.555
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as the announcement was made that it was coming to the home market, all I hear is, Oh my God, this is going to be the savior of the world.

01:46:50.795 --> 01:46:53.097
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't like it, you're Satan.

01:46:53.137 --> 01:46:55.438
[SPEAKER_04]: You should be castrated and all this stuff.

01:46:56.859 --> 01:46:57.899
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with you there.

01:46:57.980 --> 01:46:58.560
[SPEAKER_20]: In the groove...

01:47:00.087 --> 01:47:20.193
[SPEAKER_20]: I know some great people in the Indigroove fanbase, don't get me wrong, there's some really great people, but like a large chunk of the Indigroove fanbase, oh my god, oh my god, DDR is not dead, stop dancing on the grave of DDR, because DDR has no grave yet, they will have releases this year, I have utmost faith DDR will continue.

01:47:21.138 --> 01:47:23.360
[SPEAKER_04]: They sold a million copies last year alone.

01:47:23.380 --> 01:47:24.641
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's just pull the plug now.

01:47:24.701 --> 01:47:25.261
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

01:47:25.281 --> 01:47:31.226
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't put out a press release like that and then pull the plug on it, although... We're so happy we made the money, but that's all we're going to make.

01:47:31.306 --> 01:47:32.426
[SPEAKER_20]: We're starting again.

01:47:32.927 --> 01:47:34.528
[SPEAKER_20]: It sometimes feels that way, doesn't it?

01:47:34.868 --> 01:47:35.689
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, I'm all... Go ahead.

01:47:37.630 --> 01:47:40.793
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, as far as In the Groove goes, I'm sure it's not a bad game.

01:47:40.933 --> 01:47:42.914
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure that I'll have fun with it.

01:47:42.954 --> 01:47:44.575
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to buy it.

01:47:44.596 --> 01:47:46.837
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll probably be the one who reviews it for Inside Pulse.

01:47:47.418 --> 01:47:50.520
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure it's not going to be the ultra-savior of this

01:47:51.602 --> 01:47:53.083
[SPEAKER_04]: I love predictions.

01:47:53.123 --> 01:47:54.943
[SPEAKER_04]: I love predictions and making stuff up.

01:47:54.963 --> 01:47:55.484
[SPEAKER_04]: This is great.

01:47:55.644 --> 01:47:56.504
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, what is it?

01:47:56.544 --> 01:47:56.944
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.

01:47:57.424 --> 01:47:57.845
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear you there.

01:48:17.915 --> 01:48:18.776
[SPEAKER_07]: That goes without saying.

01:48:19.256 --> 01:48:19.776
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

01:48:19.816 --> 01:48:20.457
[SPEAKER_20]: It's got to happen.

01:48:20.717 --> 01:48:25.680
[SPEAKER_20]: Just like how Konami advertised the Dance Mania CDs, I think they'll be a very similar sort of advertisement.

01:48:26.101 --> 01:48:29.343
[SPEAKER_20]: And when you see the little figure dancing, it'll be on a red octane pad.

01:48:29.483 --> 01:48:29.983
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

01:48:30.163 --> 01:48:31.124
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you're absolutely right on that.

01:48:31.724 --> 01:48:32.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:48:32.925 --> 01:48:34.987
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be very interesting to see.

01:48:35.207 --> 01:48:36.948
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, do you suck right now?

01:48:37.188 --> 01:48:38.349
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy an ignition pad.

01:48:38.429 --> 01:48:38.609
[SPEAKER_04]: Only $100.

01:48:38.769 --> 01:48:41.351
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can pass that... Do you still suck?

01:48:42.031 --> 01:48:46.735
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you can pass that fucking insane 13-footer with all the fucking useless hand plants in it.

01:48:46.775 --> 01:48:47.215
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, it's just...

01:48:48.340 --> 01:48:49.321
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you still suck?

01:48:49.341 --> 01:48:51.063
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to pass our expert zones?

01:48:51.303 --> 01:48:52.604
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy our metal pad.

01:48:52.624 --> 01:48:56.789
[SPEAKER_04]: It's only $100 less than the best one on the market.

01:48:59.071 --> 01:48:59.892
[SPEAKER_20]: I can see that happening.

01:49:01.213 --> 01:49:02.174
[SPEAKER_20]: How about Indigroove2?

01:49:02.214 --> 01:49:03.816
[SPEAKER_20]: What are your thoughts on what you've seen on that so far?

01:49:05.109 --> 01:49:17.719
[SPEAKER_04]: I just caught the story a couple hours ago, and when I first saw that there was going to be a brand new cabinet made for it, the first thing I thought was very, very good move on RockSource's part for getting a new cabinet.

01:49:17.799 --> 01:49:25.645
[SPEAKER_04]: It will further differentiate themselves from Dance Dance Revolution, especially since they're not going to be solely piggybacking off their hardware.

01:49:27.398 --> 01:49:29.539
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree to an extent.

01:49:29.599 --> 01:49:36.201
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they're going to win over anybody who was anti-In the Groove because of the fact that it's invading DDR's turf.

01:49:36.221 --> 01:49:37.862
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't think they're going to win anybody over with that.

01:49:38.322 --> 01:49:44.744
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think they may win over some arcade owners, which is the important part, really, if you think about it.

01:49:45.524 --> 01:49:48.585
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever they win over is negligible at this point.

01:49:48.625 --> 01:49:53.207
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that this way, In the Groove, looks more separate...

01:49:53.973 --> 01:50:05.041
[SPEAKER_04]: from DDR than currently because all in the group was beforehand was a simple upgrade kit for any and all DDR machines.

01:50:06.943 --> 01:50:09.304
[SPEAKER_20]: It was DDR ITG mix, really.

01:50:09.324 --> 01:50:09.765
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.

01:50:12.167 --> 01:50:13.968
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be very interesting this year.

01:50:14.268 --> 01:50:17.591
[SPEAKER_04]: I've said it as soon as Pump It Up received home release this year.

01:50:17.631 --> 01:50:20.793
[SPEAKER_04]: This is going to be the best year for dance games on the whole.

01:50:20.833 --> 01:50:23.335
[SPEAKER_20]: It's either going to be the best year or it's going to be the worst year.

01:50:24.091 --> 01:50:26.212
[SPEAKER_20]: It could all be over after this year, honestly.

01:50:27.032 --> 01:50:27.392
[SPEAKER_04]: It could.

01:50:27.452 --> 01:50:35.594
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's a possibility that these dance games all do fair and they all cancel each other out.

01:50:37.294 --> 01:50:38.414
[SPEAKER_20]: That's a distinct possibility.

01:50:38.654 --> 01:50:42.115
[SPEAKER_20]: But I think that E3 is going to be a very interesting show this year.

01:50:42.615 --> 01:50:44.356
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very much looking forward to E3.

01:50:44.416 --> 01:50:45.356
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could go.

01:50:45.496 --> 01:50:47.537
[SPEAKER_04]: Final exams are a bitch because I can't.

01:50:48.597 --> 01:50:49.377
[SPEAKER_20]: That sucks, man.

01:50:49.980 --> 01:50:50.220
[SPEAKER_20]: Madesco

01:51:13.447 --> 01:51:13.727
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe?

01:51:14.407 --> 01:51:15.087
[SPEAKER_04]: Mastiff Games.

01:51:15.268 --> 01:51:15.928
[SPEAKER_20]: Mastiff Games.

01:51:15.988 --> 01:51:18.068
[SPEAKER_20]: Mastiff was making it, but they weren't publishing it, were they?

01:51:18.508 --> 01:51:21.329
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought they were just the ones making it, and Animero themselves was publishing it.

01:51:22.630 --> 01:51:23.570
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the other way around.

01:51:23.730 --> 01:51:31.072
[SPEAKER_04]: Animero is the maker of Pump It Up, and Mastiff Games are... What the fuck do I know?

01:51:31.452 --> 01:51:31.752
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:51:32.952 --> 01:51:33.573
[SPEAKER_20]: It's all good.

01:51:34.193 --> 01:51:35.613
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, Elmullet, thanks for the call.

01:51:36.133 --> 01:51:36.613
[SPEAKER_20]: No problem.

01:51:36.653 --> 01:51:37.994
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, wait, plug your site.

01:51:38.674 --> 01:51:39.874
[SPEAKER_20]: InsidePulse.com.

01:51:39.974 --> 01:51:40.354
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

01:51:40.394 --> 01:51:41.115
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, have a good one.

01:51:41.675 --> 01:51:41.855
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

01:51:41.935 --> 01:51:42.215
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye-bye.

01:51:43.055 --> 01:51:48.238
[SPEAKER_20]: I definitely want to get to... Oh, damn it, just... There was another call coming in on the other line.

01:51:48.278 --> 01:51:49.259
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, here, good, he's calling back.

01:51:49.279 --> 01:51:54.021
[SPEAKER_20]: And I think this is somebody who supports a lot of what In The Groove is doing, from what I hear in the chat rooms.

01:51:54.061 --> 01:51:54.822
[SPEAKER_20]: This should be a good call.

01:51:55.362 --> 01:51:56.383
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:51:57.403 --> 01:51:59.004
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

01:51:59.064 --> 01:52:01.005
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?

01:52:01.766 --> 01:52:02.386
[SPEAKER_20]: Pretty good.

01:52:02.486 --> 01:52:06.528
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, this has got to be your first or second call into the station as well, right?

01:52:07.029 --> 01:52:07.669
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, my first.

01:52:07.849 --> 01:52:08.469
[SPEAKER_20]: Your first!

01:52:08.569 --> 01:52:09.730
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, another virgin!

01:52:10.390 --> 01:52:11.171
[SPEAKER_20]: Welcome to the show.

01:52:11.650 --> 01:52:12.531
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for calling in.

01:52:13.072 --> 01:52:17.196
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, I know you've got some opinions on the In The Groove stuff, so let's hear it.

01:52:17.897 --> 01:52:19.078
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got a little opinion.

01:52:19.098 --> 01:52:19.519
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up?

01:52:20.260 --> 01:52:22.862
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually got a little story beforehand about it.

01:52:23.243 --> 01:52:23.563
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:52:24.584 --> 01:52:26.246
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm out in Phoenix, Arizona.

01:52:26.747 --> 01:52:29.750
[SPEAKER_02]: They just got In The Groove, I think.

01:52:30.371 --> 01:52:33.174
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I went to the arcade and

01:52:35.912 --> 01:52:37.672
[SPEAKER_20]: Buddy, you're breaking up a little bit.

01:52:37.732 --> 01:52:39.713
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know if you can hear me, but you're starting to break up there.

01:52:39.733 --> 01:52:40.813
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn it, I wanted to hear this too.

01:52:41.113 --> 01:52:42.093
[SPEAKER_20]: You're breaking up there a little bit.

01:52:42.153 --> 01:52:46.194
[SPEAKER_20]: See if you have anything else running in the background that you can try and pause or something.

01:52:46.255 --> 01:52:46.675
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:52:46.735 --> 01:52:47.935
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes it's just a bad connection.

01:52:47.975 --> 01:52:51.196
[SPEAKER_20]: But see if you've got something there that you can pause or stop or something.

01:52:51.556 --> 01:52:51.976
[SPEAKER_20]: Try again.

01:52:52.816 --> 01:52:53.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you hear me now?

01:52:54.097 --> 01:52:55.417
[SPEAKER_20]: You're still a little bit broken up.

01:52:57.998 --> 01:52:58.338
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

01:52:58.418 --> 01:52:59.638
[SPEAKER_20]: Try calling us right back, bud.

01:52:59.818 --> 01:53:00.358
[SPEAKER_20]: Try doing that.

01:53:00.799 --> 01:53:00.999
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:53:01.019 --> 01:53:01.599
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see if that helps.

01:53:01.899 --> 01:53:02.099
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

01:53:02.981 --> 01:53:09.205
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to go ahead and let him call right back, because sometimes that helps the connection a little bit, just to kind of redo it there, because I want to let him have a chance to talk.

01:53:10.426 --> 01:53:11.186
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, you there?

01:53:12.067 --> 01:53:12.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm here.

01:53:12.767 --> 01:53:13.568
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, it's clear again.

01:53:13.648 --> 01:53:14.148
[SPEAKER_20]: Tell your story.

01:53:14.708 --> 01:53:14.968
Okay.

01:53:15.729 --> 01:53:21.172
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I went to Golfland, and they ran over there, jumped on it.

01:53:21.432 --> 01:53:25.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I was about to put in my money for it, and I realized it wasn't in the groove.

01:53:25.835 --> 01:53:30.638
[SPEAKER_03]: It just had, like, the stuff all around it, and it ended up being a third-mixed DDR machine.

01:53:30.658 --> 01:53:30.938
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

01:53:33.070 --> 01:53:35.834
[SPEAKER_20]: That's kind of like that Megamix DDR.

01:53:35.894 --> 01:53:38.257
[SPEAKER_20]: It looks like an extreme, but oh my god.

01:53:39.098 --> 01:53:39.739
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't fall off.

01:53:41.782 --> 01:53:50.454
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know what, I've yet to try it, and I want to give everything a chance like I do with Red Sox fans and German people, so...

01:53:52.238 --> 01:53:56.399
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought you were somebody in our chatroom, because I mentioned this before I picked up your call.

01:53:56.799 --> 01:54:03.801
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought you were somebody in the chatroom that was really supporting everything that the Rockstar folks are doing within the groove and are pretty open-minded to what's going on here.

01:54:04.481 --> 01:54:04.781
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that true?

01:54:04.801 --> 01:54:06.982
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know where you got that from.

01:54:07.002 --> 01:54:08.702
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, shit, I guess I'm getting you confused with somebody else.

01:54:08.762 --> 01:54:09.722
[SPEAKER_20]: My bad, I'm sorry.

01:54:10.983 --> 01:54:12.183
[SPEAKER_20]: It's okay.

01:54:12.203 --> 01:54:15.784
[SPEAKER_20]: So you're just more having an open mind in the groove and what's going on.

01:54:16.164 --> 01:54:18.345
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll try it out when it comes.

01:54:19.025 --> 01:54:20.045
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, sounds good.

01:54:20.478 --> 01:54:23.479
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think about the impact this is going to have on DDR?

01:54:25.539 --> 01:54:28.179
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, I'm sure DDR will come up with something.

01:54:28.919 --> 01:54:31.300
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything happens for a reason, so we'll see.

01:54:32.340 --> 01:54:39.781
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe the release of In the Groove will kind of light a fire under Konami of America's ass to do something new with DDR?

01:54:41.762 --> 01:54:42.622
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see, I don't know.

01:54:42.662 --> 01:54:49.823
[SPEAKER_03]: I think In the Groove knows that Konami will kick their ass either way, so...

01:54:52.351 --> 01:54:58.679
[SPEAKER_20]: So you think, regardless of this In The Groove pumping up stuff, Konami will still be king in the end?

01:54:59.380 --> 01:54:59.820
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably.

01:55:00.381 --> 01:55:05.007
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree with that, but I still think In The Groove has the potential to make a pretty fat dent.

01:55:06.449 --> 01:55:06.569
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.

01:55:06.890 --> 01:55:07.070
[SPEAKER_20]: So...

01:55:08.038 --> 01:55:09.279
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, you look like you want to say no.

01:55:09.579 --> 01:55:10.640
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I don't think so.

01:55:11.360 --> 01:55:16.904
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't think that on the red octane pads that everybody buys, because Konami doesn't do their own pads anymore.

01:55:17.464 --> 01:55:20.647
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, they do, but in such limited release, it's negligent.

01:55:21.227 --> 01:55:25.210
[SPEAKER_20]: So, on these red octane pads, they won't try to sell in the groove.

01:55:25.790 --> 01:55:29.633
[SPEAKER_20]: And you won't start seeing bundle packs of in the groove with these red octane pads like everywhere.

01:55:29.773 --> 01:55:36.077
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, I'm sure you'll see packs within the groove, but no one buys a dance pad without knowing the game that they're going to play for it.

01:55:36.637 --> 01:55:37.338
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just retarded.

01:55:38.340 --> 01:55:39.903
[SPEAKER_20]: What about grandmas buying it for their kids?

01:55:40.323 --> 01:55:44.149
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they hear on the news about the dance game that makes people lose weight.

01:55:44.309 --> 01:55:45.391
[SPEAKER_20]: And they all look the same to her.

01:55:47.094 --> 01:55:48.255
[SPEAKER_03]: Grandma, you saying I'm fat?

01:55:55.049 --> 01:55:55.569
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, what's that?

01:55:55.769 --> 01:55:58.350
[SPEAKER_21]: No, that's just a Skype message.

01:55:58.370 --> 01:55:58.730
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, go ahead.

01:55:58.891 --> 01:55:59.971
[SPEAKER_21]: That's just Grandma on TV.

01:56:00.011 --> 01:56:09.395
[SPEAKER_21]: But see, Grandma might not know, and so she'll ask the teenager working behind the counter, Whoa, what game does this work for?

01:56:09.415 --> 01:56:17.198
[SPEAKER_21]: And they'll be like, well, that works for Dance Dance Revolution, because that's the one they're familiar with, and not like, you know, that works with Britney's Dance Beat, you know, or something like that.

01:56:17.805 --> 01:56:23.170
[SPEAKER_21]: So DDR is kind of like Kleenex.

01:56:23.490 --> 01:56:27.013
[SPEAKER_21]: Instead of being a tissue, it's a Kleenex.

01:56:27.033 --> 01:56:28.554
[SPEAKER_21]: Something like that.

01:56:28.674 --> 01:56:33.679
[SPEAKER_21]: There was a whole semantics argument about this in the Quirks animated thing.

01:56:35.741 --> 01:56:37.622
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Xerox.

01:56:38.343 --> 01:56:45.409
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember the exact terminology, but once a product becomes so familiar that any product is known by that name, then it loses its trademarks.

01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:54.688
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, it's like, you know, for example, like gelatin, you know, or a band-aid, okay?

01:56:54.888 --> 01:56:56.930
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not a band-aid, it's an adhesive strip.

01:56:57.090 --> 01:56:57.551
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, right.

01:56:58.051 --> 01:56:58.992
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, something like that.

01:56:59.533 --> 01:57:03.016
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, people are going to be buying, you know, it's fine.

01:57:03.216 --> 01:57:06.159
[SPEAKER_21]: Go ahead and buy in the groove, you know, go ahead and buy it for your kids.

01:57:06.500 --> 01:57:10.544
[SPEAKER_21]: But when they go and try to play it, they're going to get bored with it and they're going to return it.

01:57:10.564 --> 01:57:10.884
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

01:57:11.385 --> 01:57:13.727
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, I want to get back to the caller, though, because the caller is on.

01:57:13.767 --> 01:57:17.450
[SPEAKER_20]: So anything else you want to share with us, SSJ100, Matt, on your thoughts on the group?

01:57:17.850 --> 01:57:21.393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, one more thing besides in the group.

01:57:21.793 --> 01:57:25.756
[SPEAKER_03]: My arcade just got a Beatmania Red 2DX machine.

01:57:26.096 --> 01:57:26.677
[SPEAKER_20]: Ah, very cool.

01:57:26.697 --> 01:57:27.257
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think of that?

01:57:28.198 --> 01:57:32.161
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I'm not a real big fan of it, because, you know, I've tried it a couple times, and, you know...

01:57:33.503 --> 01:57:37.784
[SPEAKER_03]: I usually get yelled at or get dirty looks by the people who actually do play.

01:57:54.992 --> 01:58:04.037
[SPEAKER_20]: You put your money in, you waited just as long as they did to play, you put your money in the machine, you have the right to play whatever song you want, however you want, and they can just sit there and wait their turn.

01:58:04.698 --> 01:58:07.740
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I'm a New Yorker, so I don't really give a shit what they say either way.

01:58:10.201 --> 01:58:11.442
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, amen to that, I guess.

01:58:13.984 --> 01:58:22.189
[SPEAKER_03]: There's plenty of other people, you know, with DDR who do that, or just like that, you know, that goes out to Danbury and Palisades people.

01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:30.638
[SPEAKER_20]: And Rob, to go back to what you were saying about the DDR and the Groove Bundles, that type of thing, where they're not going to know the difference.

01:58:47.423 --> 01:58:48.384
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, okay.

01:58:48.604 --> 01:58:49.364
[SPEAKER_21]: Well, that's the case.

01:58:49.584 --> 01:58:54.467
[SPEAKER_21]: Who the fuck's gonna buy an ignition pad when they can buy a bundle with DDR for 60 bucks?

01:58:55.588 --> 01:58:57.629
[SPEAKER_20]: But how often do you see those bundles with DDRs?

01:58:58.069 --> 01:58:58.589
[SPEAKER_21]: Quite often.

01:58:58.729 --> 01:58:59.410
[SPEAKER_21]: Depends where you go.

01:59:00.991 --> 01:59:01.691
[SPEAKER_21]: Like, fries.

01:59:02.612 --> 01:59:05.633
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't seen bundles there since the week the DDR came out.

01:59:07.394 --> 01:59:07.954
[SPEAKER_21]: They'll be around.

01:59:08.235 --> 01:59:08.595
[SPEAKER_21]: Trust me.

01:59:09.395 --> 01:59:09.715
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:59:09.755 --> 01:59:10.176
[SPEAKER_20]: I disagree.

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:10.736
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's see.

01:59:10.876 --> 01:59:13.257
[SPEAKER_20]: One more quick call, then we gotta get into the cage match and all that stuff.

01:59:13.297 --> 01:59:14.178
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

01:59:15.046 --> 01:59:17.627
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, my name is Ranma, and I'm an OLR-holic.

01:59:17.787 --> 01:59:19.368
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, OLR-holic.

01:59:19.648 --> 01:59:21.009
[SPEAKER_18]: Hail the OLR-me.

01:59:21.309 --> 01:59:22.490
[SPEAKER_20]: Hail to the OLR-me.

01:59:23.230 --> 01:59:23.890
[SPEAKER_18]: Humvee.

01:59:25.271 --> 01:59:25.571
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

01:59:25.891 --> 01:59:26.792
[SPEAKER_20]: Humvee?

01:59:26.912 --> 01:59:27.272
[SPEAKER_20]: Humvee.

01:59:27.612 --> 01:59:28.653
[SPEAKER_20]: What's on your mind, Ranma?

01:59:29.373 --> 01:59:29.753
[SPEAKER_18]: Not much.

01:59:29.793 --> 01:59:31.054
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to say a couple of things.

01:59:31.955 --> 01:59:33.415
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm all for it.

01:59:33.555 --> 01:59:34.396
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy for it.

01:59:35.136 --> 01:59:36.917
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd like to see more games.

01:59:36.937 --> 01:59:37.457
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all it is.

01:59:37.497 --> 01:59:38.258
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm happy for it.

01:59:38.518 --> 01:59:40.539
[SPEAKER_20]: You just want the game orgy.

01:59:41.474 --> 01:59:42.414
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I'm all for it.

01:59:42.434 --> 01:59:45.675
[SPEAKER_18]: This gives me a reason to go out and buy it.

01:59:46.355 --> 01:59:47.796
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm having fun with playing DDR.

01:59:47.976 --> 01:59:49.376
[SPEAKER_18]: In the group?

01:59:49.436 --> 01:59:49.957
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, I'll buy it.

01:59:50.017 --> 01:59:50.417
[SPEAKER_18]: Pump it up?

01:59:50.577 --> 01:59:50.997
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll buy it.

01:59:51.477 --> 01:59:55.578
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that's a fair perspective to have, and I feel a little bit similar.

01:59:56.018 --> 02:00:01.680
[SPEAKER_20]: Although part of my mentality is that whole Blood Crypts thing where I don't think that they should be invading on my turf.

02:00:02.205 --> 02:00:03.386
[SPEAKER_20]: I was so anti-pump it up for the longest.

02:00:03.406 --> 02:00:06.909
[SPEAKER_20]: And then I saw some hot chick playing it and I was like, I want to start playing that game.

02:00:26.846 --> 02:00:29.387
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:00:47.115 --> 02:00:50.919
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, it's blatantly stolen from Step Mania, but that's all In The Groove is, right?

02:00:50.979 --> 02:00:52.981
[SPEAKER_20]: No, it's actually blatantly stolen from Disney's games.

02:00:53.061 --> 02:00:54.483
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, that too, that too, that too.

02:00:54.583 --> 02:00:55.303
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever magic.

02:00:55.684 --> 02:01:07.376
[SPEAKER_20]: That too, but I'm glad Ranma brought that up, because I wanted to say, that is another thing that In The Groove has going for it, is that it is incorporating the battle mode, and I always said, I've said this for years now, how long have we been doing this show?

02:01:07.536 --> 02:01:07.957
[SPEAKER_20]: Years!

02:01:08.863 --> 02:01:10.024
[SPEAKER_20]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:01:28.755 --> 02:01:32.196
[SPEAKER_20]: But I give them props for going there, where Konami has not gone there.

02:01:32.216 --> 02:01:40.758
[SPEAKER_21]: At least, you know, when it comes down to, you know, oh, we're making the game for the fans, at least they can go, well, the fans want it faster, as in, you know, Extreme Plus or something like that.

02:01:41.278 --> 02:01:44.619
[SPEAKER_21]: At least they're kind of, you know, catering it towards the fans and that type of thing.

02:01:45.059 --> 02:01:52.041
[SPEAKER_21]: And to be honest, if Konami's not going to do anything about it, then, well, they deserve to lose the market share for it, because, hey, it's their own damn fault.

02:01:52.441 --> 02:01:53.301
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, we can't be...

02:01:54.031 --> 02:01:55.172
[SPEAKER_21]: And they gotta do something.

02:02:21.167 --> 02:02:24.909
[SPEAKER_20]: I still go back to, I think it's, we don't know what tricks Konami has up their sleeve.

02:02:25.249 --> 02:02:28.190
[SPEAKER_20]: They could trump us all and announce an E3.

02:02:28.910 --> 02:02:29.330
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.850
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't know.

02:02:29.990 --> 02:02:35.032
[SPEAKER_20]: But they could trump this whole fucking thing and an E3 this year, they announce 2DX USA.

02:02:36.212 --> 02:02:36.772
[SPEAKER_20]: They could.

02:02:36.952 --> 02:02:39.353
[SPEAKER_20]: That would be the biggest F you to all of us.

02:02:40.913 --> 02:02:45.095
[SPEAKER_18]: They could do that, but I think I know the reason why Konami's just sitting on their asses about it.

02:02:45.195 --> 02:02:46.115
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I know the reason.

02:02:46.315 --> 02:02:48.316
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think they're sitting on their asses about it.

02:02:48.376 --> 02:02:49.276
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that it's the...

02:02:51.104 --> 02:02:53.044
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree here.

02:02:53.104 --> 02:03:02.809
[SPEAKER_20]: And when we say that Konami is sitting on our ass, please realize we are talking about the corporate people who make these types of decisions about what is being released in Arcade Not.

02:03:03.069 --> 02:03:05.530
[SPEAKER_20]: The people actually making the games, i.e.

02:03:05.610 --> 02:03:14.794
[SPEAKER_20]: Konami of Hawaii, is doing an outstanding, incredible, wonderful, I lavish so much praise upon Konami.

02:03:15.490 --> 02:03:17.832
[SPEAKER_20]: The Ultramix 2 product, it's not even funny.

02:03:18.092 --> 02:03:20.034
[SPEAKER_20]: That is exactly what DDR needed.

02:03:20.795 --> 02:03:25.979
[SPEAKER_20]: The unfortunate thing is, because of the corporate end of it, we're not seeing as much of it as we should be.

02:03:26.019 --> 02:03:28.241
[SPEAKER_07]: It took the fans to get us DDR in the first place.

02:03:28.782 --> 02:03:32.725
[SPEAKER_07]: And honestly, we owe a whole lot to Jason Enos for getting it at all.

02:03:32.745 --> 02:03:33.226
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

02:03:33.506 --> 02:03:34.066
[SPEAKER_20]: Absolutely.

02:03:34.227 --> 02:03:39.391
[SPEAKER_20]: In the groove would not exist, period, if it wasn't for Jason Enos.

02:03:40.072 --> 02:03:40.332
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm.

02:03:41.380 --> 02:03:43.804
[SPEAKER_18]: But like I was saying, I was meant the corporate end of it too.

02:03:44.826 --> 02:03:48.271
[SPEAKER_18]: Do you guys remember that whole Konami and Amuro lawsuit from like years ago?

02:03:48.472 --> 02:03:49.012
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, of course.

02:03:49.073 --> 02:03:49.914
[SPEAKER_20]: It always gets brought up.

02:03:51.476 --> 02:03:55.383
[SPEAKER_20]: In discussion of In the Groove legalities, that lawsuit always gets brought up, but yes.

02:03:56.283 --> 02:04:05.106
[SPEAKER_18]: If I'm not mistaken, it wasn't after everything was said and done, Konami was kind of helping them or something like that, and they were getting some type of royalty or kickback or something like that?

02:04:05.346 --> 02:04:14.769
[SPEAKER_20]: That's the rumor, but I've heard about five different results of that, and I have yet to see anything concrete, or at least it seems like all the different answers have something concrete to go with it.

02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:21.211
[SPEAKER_20]: So I think we're just going to do what we did last year, and when we talk to somebody at Konami, we'll just ask.

02:04:22.272 --> 02:04:22.772
There you go.

02:04:23.932 --> 02:04:25.653
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll just ask and see what we can find out.

02:04:26.488 --> 02:04:27.108
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll do it again.

02:04:27.229 --> 02:04:29.350
[SPEAKER_20]: Not that they'll tell us anything, but hey, we'll ask.

02:04:30.311 --> 02:04:31.071
[SPEAKER_20]: We have no shame.

02:04:31.651 --> 02:04:33.272
[SPEAKER_20]: We have no reputation to ruin.

02:04:33.993 --> 02:04:38.056
[SPEAKER_20]: We are already a disrespected station.

02:04:38.196 --> 02:04:40.917
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't even, you know, we can't go any lower than we are already.

02:04:41.998 --> 02:04:42.819
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, that works for me.

02:04:42.979 --> 02:04:43.299
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:04:44.700 --> 02:04:49.103
[SPEAKER_18]: And my Best Buy store still has leftover red Octane pants from the holiday rush.

02:04:51.081 --> 02:04:52.862
[SPEAKER_18]: All the cheap pads just fly off the shelves.

02:04:52.903 --> 02:04:55.064
[SPEAKER_18]: Does your GameStop need a plug as well?

02:04:55.685 --> 02:04:56.305
[SPEAKER_18]: No, Best Buy.

02:04:56.345 --> 02:04:57.026
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, sorry, Best Buy.

02:04:57.046 --> 02:04:58.387
[SPEAKER_20]: Does your Best Buy need a plug as well?

02:04:58.967 --> 02:05:02.610
[SPEAKER_18]: Not really, because people look at me as a local DDR anime guru.

02:05:03.991 --> 02:05:07.594
[SPEAKER_18]: Every time they buy DDR or whatever, I tell them, get the pads, get the red octane pads.

02:05:07.634 --> 02:05:09.776
[SPEAKER_18]: If you want to play and have fun, get the pads.

02:05:10.136 --> 02:05:13.019
[SPEAKER_18]: These pads over here are not even going to last you six months, if that.

02:05:13.219 --> 02:05:14.099
[SPEAKER_18]: Get the red octanes.

02:05:14.480 --> 02:05:16.301
[SPEAKER_18]: A hundred bucks, but trust me, they're worth it.

02:05:17.702 --> 02:05:18.583
[SPEAKER_20]: I agree, I agree.

02:05:19.844 --> 02:05:22.025
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, but we're going to let you go so we can get into some other segments.

02:05:22.065 --> 02:05:24.026
[SPEAKER_20]: Any other thoughts you wanted to get out, though, before we let you go?

02:05:25.546 --> 02:05:26.387
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop buying iPods.

02:05:26.747 --> 02:05:27.047
[SPEAKER_20]: Please.

02:05:27.167 --> 02:05:28.047
[SPEAKER_20]: Make my job easier.

02:05:28.127 --> 02:05:30.088
[SPEAKER_20]: Stop buying them.

02:05:30.428 --> 02:05:31.329
[SPEAKER_20]: I will stop.

02:05:31.489 --> 02:05:35.470
[SPEAKER_20]: I will be content with the one I have and not buy any more.

02:05:35.530 --> 02:05:35.891
[SPEAKER_20]: How's that?

02:05:37.251 --> 02:05:37.671
[SPEAKER_18]: It works.

02:05:38.772 --> 02:05:39.132
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:05:39.792 --> 02:05:40.172
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you.

02:05:40.212 --> 02:05:40.813
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all I have to say.

02:05:40.873 --> 02:05:41.813
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you and good night.

02:05:41.913 --> 02:05:42.854
[SPEAKER_18]: Love you guys.

02:05:42.894 --> 02:05:43.314
[SPEAKER_20]: Good night.

02:05:43.334 --> 02:05:43.594
[SPEAKER_20]: Bye.

02:05:45.955 --> 02:05:48.796
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to go ahead and close off the Skype line there.

02:05:49.918 --> 02:05:50.138
[SPEAKER_20]: Live365.com

02:06:11.195 --> 02:06:14.396
[SPEAKER_20]: The site that we stream our station through.

02:06:14.416 --> 02:06:18.637
[SPEAKER_20]: They're good enough to provide us with the bandwidth so that all you folks can listen to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:06:19.077 --> 02:06:22.818
[SPEAKER_20]: Live 365 is doing their award ceremony again this year.

02:06:22.918 --> 02:06:23.298
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

02:06:23.958 --> 02:06:25.798
[SPEAKER_20]: And the nominations are going on right now.

02:06:26.118 --> 02:06:27.579
[SPEAKER_20]: You guys may or may not remember this.

02:06:27.619 --> 02:06:30.399
[SPEAKER_20]: I was trying to look for the sound file of this earlier, but I couldn't find it.

02:06:30.979 --> 02:06:38.441
[SPEAKER_20]: We were nominated for a Best of Live 365 award last year in Station Least Likely to Hear on AMFM Radio, which is so us, if you think about it.

02:06:39.671 --> 02:06:40.152
[SPEAKER_20]: and DarkSakura.com

02:07:01.608 --> 02:07:03.089
[SPEAKER_20]: They forgot to mention us.

02:07:03.389 --> 02:07:04.670
[SPEAKER_20]: Our name was left off the envelope.

02:07:04.690 --> 02:07:12.334
[SPEAKER_20]: So they're like, and the nominees are the Pokemon Radio Channel, the Porno Music Channel, the whatever stations we're up against.

02:07:12.714 --> 02:07:13.614
[SPEAKER_10]: And then they left us off.

02:07:14.215 --> 02:07:18.757
[SPEAKER_20]: And we were like, and it's so funny because you can hear us in the live stream of the awards.

02:07:18.797 --> 02:07:20.338
[SPEAKER_20]: You hear us in the background going, hey!

02:07:22.379 --> 02:07:24.520
[SPEAKER_20]: And then they're like, oh, oh, an Orange Lounge.

02:07:24.600 --> 02:07:26.081
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're like, at that point, we're like, well, fuck.

02:07:26.645 --> 02:07:28.407
[SPEAKER_20]: I found my bag of free CDs I got from there.

02:07:49.682 --> 02:07:52.024
[SPEAKER_20]: SSJ100 Matt is absolutely right.

02:07:52.344 --> 02:07:54.545
[SPEAKER_20]: We were like Scorsese.

02:07:54.965 --> 02:07:56.326
[SPEAKER_20]: We knew how Scorsese felt.

02:07:57.567 --> 02:07:58.668
[SPEAKER_07]: Only we're not assholes.

02:08:00.449 --> 02:08:02.570
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going for the Susan Lucci this year.

02:08:02.950 --> 02:08:07.913
[SPEAKER_20]: We want to get nominated again, and we'll probably lose again even if we get nominated, but that's okay.

02:08:07.953 --> 02:08:09.814
[SPEAKER_20]: But in order to get nominated, we need your help.

02:08:10.275 --> 02:08:15.418
[SPEAKER_20]: Please check out our LiveJournal community for all the details on how you can nominate us online.

02:08:15.871 --> 02:08:17.851
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, we're not driving down there again, are we?

02:08:17.971 --> 02:08:18.391
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, we are.

02:08:18.912 --> 02:08:22.172
[SPEAKER_20]: I am at least going, and whoever else wants to go will go.

02:08:22.832 --> 02:08:25.513
[SPEAKER_20]: I will make Angel wear the orange hat if you're not going to do it.

02:08:25.553 --> 02:08:26.273
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go do it.

02:08:26.553 --> 02:08:26.873
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:08:29.113 --> 02:08:36.095
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, I can see the pictures now, and I'm so going to get... I should go topless and paint my nipples orange.

02:08:36.155 --> 02:08:36.715
[SPEAKER_20]: And you know what?

02:08:36.775 --> 02:08:44.316
[SPEAKER_20]: And if you are in the Bay Area, I want you bitches there at the ceremony to cheer us on when we lose.

02:08:46.986 --> 02:08:49.667
[SPEAKER_20]: But in order for us to lose, we have to be nominated.

02:08:50.107 --> 02:08:55.669
[SPEAKER_20]: So, visit www.orangehoundsradio.com, click on Live Journal Community, and look at the recent post.

02:08:56.269 --> 02:08:58.629
[SPEAKER_20]: It tells you all about what we're looking for.

02:08:59.730 --> 02:09:03.051
[SPEAKER_20]: Ask a friend in the chatroom, ask an op in the chatroom, they'll tell you how to vote for us.

02:09:03.391 --> 02:09:07.632
[SPEAKER_20]: Look at live365.com, and click on the nominations form.

02:09:07.912 --> 02:09:10.153
[SPEAKER_20]: And honestly, just nominate us and everything.

02:09:10.493 --> 02:09:10.673
[SPEAKER_20]: Just...

02:09:11.923 --> 02:09:15.705
[SPEAKER_20]: But be sure you put station name Orange Lounge, not Orange Lounge Radio.

02:09:15.745 --> 02:09:17.946
[SPEAKER_20]: You have to put station name Orange Lounge.

02:09:18.527 --> 02:09:19.127
[SPEAKER_20]: All one word.

02:09:20.027 --> 02:09:27.111
[SPEAKER_20]: We are trying to get some of our buddy stations nominated, so please consider Best Soundtrack Station, DDR Freak.

02:09:27.391 --> 02:09:28.752
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to get them nominated there.

02:09:29.272 --> 02:09:33.675
[SPEAKER_20]: And Best Station Under 500 Hours, Under Station Live.

02:09:33.715 --> 02:09:34.995
[SPEAKER_20]: We're trying to get them nominated as well.

02:09:35.256 --> 02:09:36.216
[SPEAKER_20]: So for your consideration.

02:09:36.236 --> 02:09:37.637
[SPEAKER_20]: That is all in the Live Journal community.

02:09:38.357 --> 02:09:39.658
[SPEAKER_20]: Do not vote for the porno music.

02:09:41.051 --> 02:09:43.253
[SPEAKER_20]: I think they're ineligible because they won last year.

02:09:43.553 --> 02:09:46.915
[SPEAKER_20]: So our biggest competition this year is the Pokemon music.

02:09:46.955 --> 02:09:50.178
[SPEAKER_20]: And then that crazy, like, whatever radio, the Paranormal.

02:09:50.478 --> 02:09:51.739
[SPEAKER_21]: Don't listen to that Paranormal.

02:09:51.759 --> 02:09:51.799
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh!

02:09:51.879 --> 02:09:53.180
[SPEAKER_20]: The Paranormal Station!

02:09:53.200 --> 02:09:53.660
[SPEAKER_20]: That was rad.

02:09:53.680 --> 02:09:54.901
[SPEAKER_21]: The Paranormal Station sucks.

02:09:54.921 --> 02:10:00.145
[SPEAKER_21]: You need to listen to, if you're going to listen to the Paranormal, listen to, what was that, the AM show that's on?

02:10:00.185 --> 02:10:01.025
[SPEAKER_21]: I gotta, I can't remember.

02:10:01.165 --> 02:10:04.007
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, you know why the Paranormal folks didn't go to the awards ceremony?

02:10:05.548 --> 02:10:07.550
[SPEAKER_20]: They were afraid that the man was going to get them?

02:10:07.570 --> 02:10:07.910
[SPEAKER_20]: No, they are.

02:10:07.930 --> 02:10:08.871
[SPEAKER_21]: You just told them not to?

02:10:08.951 --> 02:10:09.231
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

02:10:09.331 --> 02:10:10.472
[SPEAKER_20]: They already knew they weren't going to win.

02:10:15.745 --> 02:10:16.705
[SPEAKER_21]: Pokemon Radio.

02:10:16.725 --> 02:10:18.345
[SPEAKER_21]: What the fuck is Pokemon Radio?

02:10:18.385 --> 02:10:18.906
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what?

02:10:18.926 --> 02:10:22.807
[SPEAKER_21]: Is there enough music in that show to be a radio station?

02:10:23.047 --> 02:10:24.027
[SPEAKER_20]: You best believe it.

02:10:24.167 --> 02:10:25.268
[SPEAKER_20]: There is a lot of stuff.

02:10:25.288 --> 02:10:25.948
[SPEAKER_18]: Pokemon!

02:10:27.468 --> 02:10:28.849
[SPEAKER_18]: Gotta catch them all!

02:10:29.929 --> 02:10:30.369
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what?

02:10:30.569 --> 02:10:35.571
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't dog on the Pokemon Radio station because I've seen the guy posting around the forums and he's actually a pretty nice guy.

02:10:36.791 --> 02:10:38.512
[SPEAKER_20]: That doesn't mean I don't want to beat him.

02:10:40.379 --> 02:10:40.779
[SPEAKER_21]: No.

02:10:42.060 --> 02:10:47.502
[SPEAKER_21]: We're all friends, you know, at the end of the day, but, you know, it's just like, WHO DO YOU LOVE MORE, PEOPLE?

02:10:47.662 --> 02:10:48.843
[SPEAKER_21]: It's just like this, okay?

02:10:49.223 --> 02:10:52.264
[SPEAKER_21]: When I go and play Cusar, I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

02:10:52.424 --> 02:10:55.445
[SPEAKER_21]: Do you want- At the end of the day, we're friends, but I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.

02:10:55.505 --> 02:10:56.006
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously.

02:10:57.026 --> 02:11:02.588
[SPEAKER_20]: If you don't vote for Orange Lingerie, if you don't go and nominate us, you're basically giving Pikachu this award.

02:11:03.369 --> 02:11:07.110
[SPEAKER_21]: You're supporting terrorism if you do not vote for Orange Lingerie.

02:11:08.811 --> 02:11:09.431
[SPEAKER_21]: Terrorism.

02:11:10.458 --> 02:11:11.258
[SPEAKER_21]: Thanks for watching!

02:11:32.344 --> 02:11:33.405

[SPEAKER_02]: And listen to our podcast.

02:11:36.989 --> 02:11:39.552

[SPEAKER_20]: And listen to our podcast.

02:11:40.373 --> 02:11:40.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like us.

02:11:41.775 --> 02:11:45.799
[SPEAKER_20]: But while you're there, certainly you can find one category to nominate us in.

02:11:46.259 --> 02:11:47.621
[SPEAKER_20]: And listen to our podcast.

02:11:47.881 --> 02:11:48.081

[SPEAKER_20]: Three songs.

[SPEAKER_20]: Here's the first one.

02:12:20.427 --> 02:12:21.968
[SPEAKER_20]: A clip of last week's winner.

02:12:22.409 --> 02:12:28.874
[SPEAKER_20]: Who, by the way, dethroned Freeze Pop and Stakeout, robbing it of the retirement.

02:12:29.474 --> 02:12:32.557
[SPEAKER_20]: And that was all thanks to the tiebreaker vote from Jamie.

02:12:32.957 --> 02:12:34.378
[SPEAKER_20]: So this song went in instead.

02:12:34.518 --> 02:12:38.482
[SPEAKER_20]: It's The Dignity of Labor with XRV, the Never Rock a Mix.

02:12:38.502 --> 02:12:38.902
[SPEAKER_20]: Here's a clip.

02:14:50.605 --> 02:15:13.464
There is no form I cannot penetrate If only you could see the pain I feel in you A mirror to your soul is free Without a trace of vanity I'll share with you the mastery Reveal your agony with a copy

02:15:15.345 --> 02:15:16.348
Thanks for watching!

02:15:44.252 --> 02:15:48.293
[SPEAKER_20]: All right, kids, that was a clip of song number one, The Dignity of Labor with XRV.

02:15:48.433 --> 02:15:53.554
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week's winner, here are two new songs that you're going to hear in their entirety now.

02:15:54.074 --> 02:15:58.435
[SPEAKER_20]: Your vote will determine which one goes into rotation all week long on the station.

02:15:58.475 --> 02:15:59.475
[SPEAKER_20]: Here is song number two.

02:15:59.916 --> 02:16:00.716
[SPEAKER_20]: It's my pick.

02:16:01.376 --> 02:16:05.517
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm picking a band called Day Behavior, which you know from Ultramix 2.

02:16:05.577 --> 02:16:06.297
[SPEAKER_20]: They did the song Starlight.

02:16:07.533 --> 02:16:10.217
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week's winner, Jamie's asking what song number one was.

02:16:10.477 --> 02:16:14.843
[SPEAKER_20]: Last week's winner, Dignity of Labor with XRV, Loki's pick.

02:16:14.883 --> 02:16:17.326
[SPEAKER_20]: Remember you broke the tie and stole it from Freeze Pop?

02:16:18.227 --> 02:16:21.191
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, I had to huck up a lung cookie in Freeze Pop's honor.

02:16:23.061 --> 02:16:29.665
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, the song I picked, I picked a song by Day Behavior, who did the song Close Your Eyes and Superstar in Ultramix 2.

02:16:29.985 --> 02:16:32.947
[SPEAKER_20]: They have a song on their CD, what the hell's the name of the CD?

02:16:32.987 --> 02:16:34.228
[SPEAKER_20]: Have You Ever Touched a Dream?

02:16:34.688 --> 02:16:38.991
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a fluffy CD, it's like a fluffy little cotton candy cloud, I like it.

02:16:39.391 --> 02:16:44.494
[SPEAKER_20]: And this song is called Mona Me, and I like this song, so this is my pick for tonight's stage match.

02:16:44.554 --> 02:16:46.195
[SPEAKER_20]: Day Behavior with Mona Me, enjoy.

02:16:46.215 --> 02:16:52.519
[SPEAKER_14]: La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

02:16:53.021 --> 02:17:22.126
[SPEAKER_14]: La la la la la la me Fall in love with the day Whatever I say I'm finally on my own It's imprint from my fingers when I squeeze this bloody heart I hear a stranger when I speak A movement from the dark It's a sweet and sour combination

02:17:40.482 --> 02:17:56.329
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm coming to stay, I'm finally on my way Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na

02:18:10.623 --> 02:18:18.375
I'd like to come home in the night And have a room without you The Beauty Maker is like a band of fire

02:18:33.793 --> 02:18:36.154
I'm coming to play, I'm finally on my way

02:19:20.046 --> 02:19:29.533
[SPEAKER_14]: La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La

02:19:54.859 --> 02:19:56.640
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

02:20:28.180 --> 02:20:42.645
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Day Behavior with Monami, and let's see if the folks in studio like that, even though it's not really their decision, it's yours, but it doesn't stop us from giving you our big fat opinions, starting off with DarkSakura.

02:20:43.705 --> 02:20:47.767
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an okay song, but I don't like her voice, so it gets a seven.

02:20:49.347 --> 02:20:50.248
[SPEAKER_20]: Seven from Jamie.

02:20:50.368 --> 02:20:50.628
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki.

02:20:51.664 --> 02:21:02.515
[SPEAKER_21]: I was saying that it reminded me of the one woman that was singing from Aurora in Ordinary World.

02:21:02.755 --> 02:21:06.518
[SPEAKER_21]: It sort of reminded me of that, at least voice-wise, but it was okay.

02:21:08.100 --> 02:21:11.904
[SPEAKER_21]: I like day behavior, but it's a little too happy for me.

02:21:12.104 --> 02:21:13.926
[SPEAKER_21]: I mean, I guess it's okay.

02:21:14.626 --> 02:21:15.327
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll give it an 8.

02:21:17.225 --> 02:21:20.128
[SPEAKER_20]: I was actually expecting you to, like, give it a zero, but that's cool.

02:21:20.168 --> 02:21:26.353
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I mean, it wasn't, like, it wasn't freeze-pop annoying, so, um, it, no, it's, it's okay, I mean.

02:21:26.674 --> 02:21:26.974
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:21:26.994 --> 02:21:29.756
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm open to new type of music, except for freeze-pop.

02:21:30.157 --> 02:21:32.159
[SPEAKER_20]: I ain't gonna complain, an eight's a pretty good score.

02:21:32.739 --> 02:21:32.979
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright.

02:21:33.560 --> 02:21:34.060
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian.

02:21:35.221 --> 02:21:35.742
[SPEAKER_05]: It isn't bad.

02:21:36.242 --> 02:21:40.226
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, I'll probably get tired of it after I have to listen to it several times, so I'll give it a seven.

02:21:41.087 --> 02:21:42.007
[SPEAKER_20]: Seven from Arcadian.

02:21:42.028 --> 02:21:42.208
[SPEAKER_20]: Uh, Angel.

02:21:42.288 --> 02:21:42.468
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

02:21:43.642 --> 02:21:49.046
[SPEAKER_06]: I picture that song like being in some happy-go-lucky anime music video or something.

02:21:50.527 --> 02:21:51.027
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably a 7.

02:21:51.087 --> 02:21:52.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'll just give it a 7.

02:21:54.109 --> 02:21:59.153
[SPEAKER_20]: I think that song's awesome because it sounds like it should be the background music in Postal 2.

02:21:59.193 --> 02:22:01.894
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, that was hilarious.

02:22:01.914 --> 02:22:02.895
[SPEAKER_21]: We'll get into that later.

02:22:02.935 --> 02:22:03.696
[SPEAKER_20]: I give it a 9.

02:22:05.657 --> 02:22:09.660
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's go on to the third song brought to us by DarkSakura.

02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:11.601
[SPEAKER_20]: She's going with an old favorite tonight.

02:22:13.228 --> 02:22:18.630
[SPEAKER_07]: I, for a while, was getting really, really annoyed by Hamasaki Ayumi's voice, just because she's very nasal.

02:22:19.230 --> 02:22:21.191
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I remembered how much I like this mix.

02:22:21.911 --> 02:22:24.352
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, I think it's, um, Kanaria?

02:22:24.592 --> 02:22:24.872
[SPEAKER_14]: Mm-hmm.

02:22:25.353 --> 02:22:27.033
[SPEAKER_07]: So, um, yeah, that one.

02:22:27.153 --> 02:22:29.434
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's one of the, uh, IRO tracks.

02:22:30.214 --> 02:22:30.655
[SPEAKER_07]: I think.

02:22:32.315 --> 02:22:32.575
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:22:33.356 --> 02:22:34.536
[SPEAKER_20]: Can't go wrong with IU trance.

02:22:34.986 --> 02:22:35.467
[SPEAKER_20]: Or can you?

02:22:35.567 --> 02:22:35.927
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

02:22:36.007 --> 02:22:36.668
[SPEAKER_07]: It is IU Trance.

02:22:36.688 --> 02:22:38.610
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

02:22:38.650 --> 02:22:40.432
[SPEAKER_21]: I kind of wonder if she has a new IU Trance.

02:22:40.532 --> 02:22:44.336
[SPEAKER_21]: It's been a while since number three.

02:22:44.357 --> 02:22:44.797
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see.

02:22:45.077 --> 02:22:45.978
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll check CD Japan.

02:22:46.359 --> 02:22:46.539
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:22:46.559 --> 02:22:48.801
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, let's see if this is worthy of a cage match win.

02:22:48.902 --> 02:22:54.928
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Hamasaki Ayumi, or if you pronounce it the other way around, it's Ayumi Hamasaki, with Kanaria.

02:22:55.229 --> 02:22:55.449
[SPEAKER_20]: Enjoy.

02:24:35.587 --> 02:24:36.670
Thanks for watching!

02:26:34.049 --> 02:26:39.156
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number three, Ayumi Hamasaki or Hamasaki Ayumi, however you prefer.

02:26:39.517 --> 02:26:40.058
[SPEAKER_20]: Kanaria.

02:26:42.461 --> 02:26:42.801
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie.

02:26:44.103 --> 02:26:46.927
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm getting it for my dislike of trance, too.

02:26:48.068 --> 02:26:48.429
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine.

02:26:49.610 --> 02:26:50.872
[SPEAKER_20]: Nine from DarkSakura.

02:26:51.092 --> 02:26:51.413
[SPEAKER_20]: Bogey.

02:26:52.847 --> 02:26:53.728
[SPEAKER_21]: Are You Trance is good.

02:26:53.768 --> 02:26:55.469
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't listened to that in a long time.

02:26:55.970 --> 02:27:01.054
[SPEAKER_21]: Mainly because I treat my CDs like crap and I throw them behind my seat when I'm done listening to them.

02:27:01.494 --> 02:27:04.257
[SPEAKER_21]: And then I wonder why they're scratched and stuff like that.

02:27:05.117 --> 02:27:11.983
[SPEAKER_21]: So I give that an 8 because it's not one of my favorite songs on there, but it was still pretty good.

02:27:14.785 --> 02:27:15.166
[SPEAKER_20]: Sounds good.

02:27:15.446 --> 02:27:15.866
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian, 42.

02:27:16.247 --> 02:27:18.849
[SPEAKER_05]: Good, I'll give it an 8.

02:27:18.909 --> 02:27:19.029
[SPEAKER_05]: Angel.

02:27:19.970 --> 02:27:20.170
[SPEAKER_20]: Angel.

02:27:21.866 --> 02:27:22.286
[SPEAKER_06]: It's only nine.

02:27:22.306 --> 02:27:25.369
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know, just like...

02:27:49.984 --> 02:27:51.964
[SPEAKER_21]: Am Above and Beyond, I love that one.

02:27:52.084 --> 02:27:56.905
[SPEAKER_21]: In fact, I have that song, Burned, again, on my latest CD.

02:27:56.945 --> 02:28:00.406
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm listening to my car, Am Above and Beyond, again, because I love listening to that song.

02:28:01.126 --> 02:28:08.168
[SPEAKER_21]: And then there was the other one that Bomani Religious did for a long-ass time ago, but that one was pretty good, too.

02:28:08.228 --> 02:28:09.348
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't remember the name of it.

02:28:09.488 --> 02:28:11.429
[SPEAKER_20]: That whole CD is sex, honestly.

02:28:11.969 --> 02:28:12.649
[SPEAKER_20]: IU Trans 1.

02:28:13.309 --> 02:28:13.529
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

02:28:14.241 --> 02:28:15.562
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, let's let the chairman vote.

02:28:15.582 --> 02:28:16.382
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do a recap.

02:28:16.703 --> 02:28:20.865
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, you can place your vote right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

02:28:20.905 --> 02:28:24.047
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number one, Dignity of Labor, XRV, Never Rock-A-Mix.

02:28:24.868 --> 02:28:27.729
[SPEAKER_14]: Song number two, Day Behavior, Mon Ami.

02:28:43.756 --> 02:28:47.099
[SPEAKER_20]: and song number three, Ayumi Hamasaki, Kanada Ya.

02:28:59.790 --> 02:29:02.192
[SPEAKER_20]: Please vote now.

02:29:02.312 --> 02:29:04.894
[SPEAKER_20]: Send a private message to Sky, S-K-I-E.

02:29:04.974 --> 02:29:07.977
[SPEAKER_20]: That's me in the chat room with your vote and I will tally them up.

02:29:08.755 --> 02:29:09.838
[SPEAKER_20]: and let you know who won.

02:29:10.019 --> 02:29:11.704
[SPEAKER_20]: So stay tuned to find out the winner.

02:29:11.724 --> 02:29:13.329
[SPEAKER_20]: So place vote now.

02:29:14.292 --> 02:29:14.793
[SPEAKER_20]: Meantime...

02:29:16.244 --> 02:29:20.787
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, I know there's no point in me asking you this anymore, but you know I've got to ask.

02:29:20.847 --> 02:29:22.568
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel like we owe it to the listeners.

02:29:22.948 --> 02:29:24.489
[SPEAKER_20]: Is there any sim scene news this week?

02:29:27.110 --> 02:29:37.797
[SPEAKER_21]: There's only one thing I can think of off the top of my head, and it's just something that's been going on for a while, but it's worth mentioning since all the other websites that had links to them are gone.

02:29:39.137 --> 02:29:41.119
[SPEAKER_21]: On Aaron in Japan, there's a forum.

02:29:41.339 --> 02:29:43.360
[SPEAKER_21]: I can't remember the thread name for the life of me.

02:29:43.760 --> 02:29:44.040
[SPEAKER_21]: and so on.

02:30:04.412 --> 02:30:05.352
[SPEAKER_21]: They're just sets.

02:30:05.692 --> 02:30:08.393
[SPEAKER_21]: For example, they have DDR Fever or whatever.

02:30:09.234 --> 02:30:10.274
[SPEAKER_21]: And stuff like that.

02:30:10.294 --> 02:30:12.655
[SPEAKER_21]: DDR Extreme something.

02:30:13.856 --> 02:30:18.838
[SPEAKER_21]: But there's a lot of new sim files on there that you could be listening to and playing and stuff.

02:30:19.218 --> 02:30:29.963
[SPEAKER_21]: They're brand new, but the problem is since all those websites went down like DDR Maniacs and DDR UK that used to link to them where they'd be able to announce that stuff it's harder to find them now.

02:30:30.083 --> 02:30:30.303
[SPEAKER_21]: So

02:30:31.380 --> 02:30:32.140
[SPEAKER_21]: Check that out.

02:30:32.641 --> 02:30:46.129
[SPEAKER_21]: And once again, my favorite thing to do, at least it used to be back in the day when Bomani Sims was still around, is to go just do a simple search for DDR DWI or something, and you'd be surprised.

02:30:46.149 --> 02:30:48.190
[SPEAKER_21]: You can find a whole lot of Japanese...

02:30:48.755 --> 02:30:50.156
[SPEAKER_21]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:31:07.773 --> 02:31:09.794
[SPEAKER_21]: I don't know, just check that stuff out there.

02:31:10.655 --> 02:31:20.299
[SPEAKER_21]: You can also find stuff, I believe, that, of course, the DDRUK channel is still open on IRC, and I'm sure all your official sim files are still there.

02:31:22.180 --> 02:31:27.463
[SPEAKER_21]: And who knows, maybe they even have, like, a new song for the new Ultramix pack.

02:31:27.563 --> 02:31:31.805
[SPEAKER_21]: But, yeah, so just go check those out.

02:31:32.165 --> 02:31:33.245
[SPEAKER_21]: Just do some searching.

02:31:33.446 --> 02:31:34.246
[SPEAKER_21]: Google is your friend.

02:31:36.678 --> 02:31:37.960
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sounds good.

02:31:39.362 --> 02:31:44.028
[SPEAKER_20]: This is worth mentioning too, because it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of SimScene related.

02:31:44.809 --> 02:31:51.178
[SPEAKER_20]: It's another DDR game born from, I think, SimScene, the SimScene, and that's that Neon FM.

02:31:51.519 --> 02:31:51.739
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

02:31:51.839 --> 02:31:53.021
[SPEAKER_20]: Launched a website this week.

02:31:53.682 --> 02:31:53.842
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes.

02:31:54.876 --> 02:31:56.738
[SPEAKER_21]: That was... I think we mentioned it a while back.

02:31:57.018 --> 02:31:58.559
[SPEAKER_21]: We did, but... I did mention it a while back.

02:31:58.579 --> 02:32:06.085
[SPEAKER_21]: It was... In the music production thread on Bumai Style, there was a group, a company that was looking for artists to do music for a new dance game.

02:32:06.545 --> 02:32:13.791
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the new dance game, and... But it's relevant again because it's... The website launched and everything.

02:32:18.154 --> 02:32:23.859
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways... So... There was... Yeah, for example, there was...

02:32:24.943 --> 02:32:36.817
[SPEAKER_21]: God, uh, there's some of the people from, um, the DWI Palace, um, it's like Dave and DJ Slash, I believe.

02:32:38.239 --> 02:32:51.851
[SPEAKER_21]: and they were actually, they're listed on there, DJ Potatoes on there Thomas Howard with, what was it, the World's, I can't remember Wasn't there a song called like Girls Butts or something like that in there?

02:32:51.871 --> 02:33:00.278
[SPEAKER_21]: No, it's not like that, but there's a World's like Cure, World's something We played it a long ass time ago on the station and it sucked

02:33:02.142 --> 02:33:07.188
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought Freeze Pop with Stakeout is in it.

02:33:07.889 --> 02:33:09.651
[SPEAKER_21]: Jazzy Kid is in there.

02:33:09.711 --> 02:33:10.532
[SPEAKER_21]: That's kind of cool.

02:33:11.232 --> 02:33:14.476
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to say that wasn't DM Ashura on there too?

02:33:14.696 --> 02:33:15.858
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm pretty sure he was.

02:33:16.418 --> 02:33:16.979
[SPEAKER_20]: I think so.

02:33:17.822 --> 02:33:25.027
[SPEAKER_20]: I heard a rumor, now maybe this is just a rumor, I heard a rumor that Ashura was kind of pissed at the In The Groove folks because one of the songs takes a riff from him or something.

02:33:25.087 --> 02:33:29.030
[SPEAKER_21]: Yes, and it's that one that they actually have the videos for from In The Groove 2.

02:33:29.951 --> 02:33:37.656
[SPEAKER_21]: It basically follows the same pattern as, well first off it rips off Max, and then you also have

02:33:38.152 --> 02:33:42.195
[SPEAKER_21]: Rick Safa, Neomax, you know, with the piano slowdown type of thing.

02:33:44.657 --> 02:33:47.799
[SPEAKER_21]: So you've got that on there, and he's just kind of pissed off at that.

02:33:48.179 --> 02:33:55.704
[SPEAKER_21]: To be honest, I would like to see this Neon FM or whatever it is, Neon whatever it is, come out and kick ass.

02:33:55.764 --> 02:33:58.866
[SPEAKER_21]: But it looks a little weird, I think, from what I've seen.

02:33:58.926 --> 02:34:07.192
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't it like, it's like five... It's a five panel layout, and it's laid out like five key beat mania, which I think is very odd.

02:34:08.587 --> 02:34:12.108
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so, I don't know.

02:34:14.708 --> 02:34:15.768
[SPEAKER_20]: But odd in a good way.

02:34:16.088 --> 02:34:18.129
[SPEAKER_20]: Like, I want to try it.

02:34:18.169 --> 02:34:18.809
[SPEAKER_20]: It seems different.

02:34:18.869 --> 02:34:21.269
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a different way to have it laid out and it sounds like fun.

02:34:21.309 --> 02:34:23.270
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's feat mania.

02:34:27.110 --> 02:34:35.912
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you remember, way back in the day, there was a humongous five-key controller.

02:34:36.693 --> 02:34:37.193
[SPEAKER_20]: I remember.

02:34:37.213 --> 02:34:38.374
[SPEAKER_20]: Didn't somebody do one?

02:34:38.754 --> 02:34:39.054
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:34:40.075 --> 02:34:40.915
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a big joke.

02:34:40.935 --> 02:34:49.019
[SPEAKER_20]: Didn't we set it up one time at some Bomani party where we went into the key config and we changed all the keys for B-Media so we could play it with our feet on the dance pad?

02:34:49.419 --> 02:34:50.040
[SPEAKER_20]: Kind of funny.

02:34:50.780 --> 02:34:56.023
[SPEAKER_07]: But no, this was like a joke that was on like, not, it was like two DDR Freak boards ago.

02:34:56.043 --> 02:34:59.465
[SPEAKER_07]: A joke that was going around.

02:35:00.905 --> 02:35:01.906
[SPEAKER_07]: I think back on the green board.

02:35:04.707 --> 02:35:05.107
[SPEAKER_20]: I think so.

02:35:05.287 --> 02:35:05.708
[SPEAKER_20]: I think you're right.

02:35:05.868 --> 02:35:06.348
[SPEAKER_07]: It's that old.

02:35:07.133 --> 02:35:15.458
[SPEAKER_20]: But what I can like about this game, and this is interesting because, you know, here we go, I just talked about this whole, you know, in the groove is invading on DDR space.

02:35:15.758 --> 02:35:21.222
[SPEAKER_20]: But what I like about this Neon FM, they're going to have to do a new cabinet because it's a new dance layout.

02:35:21.922 --> 02:35:23.583
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's a new dance layout.

02:35:23.643 --> 02:35:26.345
[SPEAKER_20]: The game looks a lot different because of it.

02:35:26.605 --> 02:35:29.567
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm kind of curious to see what becomes of this game.

02:35:29.587 --> 02:35:35.731
[SPEAKER_21]: I can appreciate this game over in the groove because it's not trying to be a DDR, it's trying to be a dance game.

02:35:35.951 --> 02:35:36.231
[SPEAKER_21]: Dance.

02:35:36.731 --> 02:35:38.372
[SPEAKER_20]: I give props to this game.

02:35:38.732 --> 02:35:42.615
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though the song list is kind of weird, at least it has freeze pop, and that's cool.

02:35:42.915 --> 02:35:44.956
[SPEAKER_20]: So, I'm cool with this so far.

02:35:45.216 --> 02:35:48.959
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, so, I mean, at least they're getting talented people to make the music.

02:35:49.039 --> 02:35:51.200
[SPEAKER_21]: No offense to the group of people, but, I mean...

02:35:52.775 --> 02:35:59.120
[SPEAKER_21]: There's a lot of talented Bomani fan people out there that are making music.

02:35:59.881 --> 02:36:01.402
[SPEAKER_21]: I think it stands a pretty good chance.

02:36:01.422 --> 02:36:07.527
[SPEAKER_21]: The layout's a little weird, but I've got to try it before I can actually pass judgment on it.

02:36:07.807 --> 02:36:08.528
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll see, huh?

02:36:08.648 --> 02:36:09.929
[SPEAKER_21]: It still looks funky.

02:36:10.569 --> 02:36:14.713
[SPEAKER_21]: It kind of reminds me almost like Steppin' Music, but Steppin' Music's more like...

02:36:15.553 --> 02:36:18.215
[SPEAKER_21]: You know, um... Spider Stomp.

02:36:20.057 --> 02:36:21.298
[SPEAKER_21]: God, Spider Stomp.

02:36:22.139 --> 02:36:22.859
[SPEAKER_21]: That game's fun.

02:36:23.880 --> 02:36:26.082
[SPEAKER_07]: Our first arcade dancing experience.

02:36:26.602 --> 02:36:28.524
[SPEAKER_07]: Stepping on those big shiny buttons.

02:36:28.984 --> 02:36:35.850
[SPEAKER_21]: God, I remember freestyling Spider Stomp at the, uh... Vacaville... Or, not Vacaville, the, um...

02:36:37.748 --> 02:36:45.171
[SPEAKER_21]: Dublin, like, QZAR, because there was no DDR there, so I had to play something.

02:36:47.511 --> 02:36:49.332
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to go to a break.

02:36:49.712 --> 02:36:54.254
[SPEAKER_20]: When we come back from the break, I'm going to announce the winner of the Orange Laundry to a cage match, and we've got to get into the FUs of the week!

02:36:54.274 --> 02:36:56.654
[SPEAKER_20]: It's going to be awesome.

02:36:58.135 --> 02:37:01.036
[SPEAKER_20]: In this break, I don't know, how about...

02:37:02.335 --> 02:37:03.555
[SPEAKER_20]: How about Feelings Won't Fade?

02:37:03.575 --> 02:37:04.675
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't played that song in a while.

02:37:04.735 --> 02:37:07.836
[SPEAKER_20]: Since we heard a System F remix, let's hear a song by System SF.

02:37:08.616 --> 02:37:21.198
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucking hate System SF because they rip off System F. God damn it, that guy was one of the founders of modern trance nowadays, and it really pisses me off that they rip off his style and his song.

02:37:21.318 --> 02:37:23.159
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, we're going to hear this song anyway, because I like this song.

02:37:23.199 --> 02:37:23.939
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, fine.

02:37:23.999 --> 02:37:27.060
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this with the Cage Match winner, the FU's of the week, and more.

02:37:27.140 --> 02:37:27.600
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back.

02:37:28.160 --> 02:37:28.560
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:29.360
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio.

02:41:10.701 --> 02:41:11.452
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

02:41:55.035 --> 02:41:57.036
Thank you for watching!

02:44:59.484 --> 02:45:00.765
[SPEAKER_08]: Bitch, get a new song.

02:45:00.965 --> 02:45:04.246
[SPEAKER_08]: An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:28.863 --> 02:45:30.805
[SPEAKER_20]: Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:45:31.586 --> 02:45:34.849
[SPEAKER_20]: And we're going to get into the cage... No, we already did the cage match.

02:45:34.869 --> 02:45:35.929
[SPEAKER_20]: We're going to get into the cage match.

02:45:36.070 --> 02:45:36.530
[SPEAKER_20]: Victor!

02:45:36.910 --> 02:45:37.771
[SPEAKER_20]: Cage match two!

02:45:37.811 --> 02:45:38.212
[SPEAKER_20]: Woo!

02:45:39.693 --> 02:45:43.496
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, it's cage match two in a brand new cabinet and a red interface.

02:45:45.418 --> 02:45:46.399
[SPEAKER_19]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

02:45:48.422 --> 02:45:49.663
[SPEAKER_20]: It's now on widescreen, though.

02:46:12.070 --> 02:46:13.312
[SPEAKER_20]: There were good songs, I guess.

02:46:13.472 --> 02:46:14.333
[SPEAKER_20]: There were good songs in there.

02:46:14.573 --> 02:46:16.655
[SPEAKER_20]: System SF, Feelings Won't Fade, starting it off.

02:46:16.735 --> 02:46:21.160
[SPEAKER_20]: After that, Midi Head, our buddy Midi Head with In My Eyes, the Midi Head remix from Ultramix 2.

02:46:21.761 --> 02:46:25.204
[SPEAKER_20]: After that, John Robinson with K'Kak from 2DX Red.

02:46:25.244 --> 02:46:26.726
[SPEAKER_20]: That's K-E-C-A-K.

02:46:27.387 --> 02:46:30.370
[SPEAKER_20]: And lastly, Yoga with Dom Dariam.

02:46:31.531 --> 02:46:32.212
[SPEAKER_20]: Kit Kat?

02:46:32.932 --> 02:46:33.313
[SPEAKER_20]: K'Kak!

02:46:35.987 --> 02:46:38.588
[SPEAKER_21]: Sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball.

02:46:40.529 --> 02:46:42.529
[SPEAKER_07]: No, cat coughing up a hairball is this.

02:46:45.570 --> 02:46:50.011
[SPEAKER_21]: That's right, you would have experience with cats and them coughing up hairballs.

02:46:51.811 --> 02:46:52.252
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway.

02:46:52.372 --> 02:46:54.232
[SPEAKER_21]: Poor Shermie sounds like she's going to choke.

02:46:54.512 --> 02:46:56.353
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's hear who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:46:57.153 --> 02:46:57.673
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, okay.

02:46:57.773 --> 02:47:01.294
[SPEAKER_20]: By one vote, we have a new cage match winner.

02:47:03.954 --> 02:47:25.347
[SPEAKER_20]: Ayumi Hamasaki With the STD song, when I say it in my white accent, Conneria You know they have cream for that When you read it, it looks like Conneria

02:47:29.207 --> 02:47:30.388
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, so there it is.

02:47:30.668 --> 02:47:32.510
[SPEAKER_20]: Song number three, your winner tonight.

02:47:32.690 --> 02:47:34.091
[SPEAKER_20]: One vote over song number one.

02:47:35.212 --> 02:47:36.714
[SPEAKER_20]: It was a very close cage match altogether.

02:47:38.755 --> 02:47:43.019
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we are going to get into one of our favorite segments.

02:47:43.139 --> 02:47:44.420
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's one of my favorite segments.

02:47:45.081 --> 02:47:47.483
[SPEAKER_20]: It's the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

02:47:47.543 --> 02:47:52.547
[SPEAKER_20]: And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:47:53.989 --> 02:47:54.149
Ahhhh.

02:48:01.229 --> 02:48:02.930
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, this is bad.

02:48:03.010 --> 02:48:04.690
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is justice.

02:48:04.770 --> 02:48:06.551
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is punishment.

02:48:06.611 --> 02:48:09.651
[SPEAKER_14]: Here is... This is fucked up.

02:48:10.572 --> 02:48:14.113
[SPEAKER_07]: A big SQ to my immune system for being a bitch.

02:48:15.973 --> 02:48:19.534
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, yeah, the virus lingered.

02:48:20.115 --> 02:48:24.956
[SPEAKER_07]: I was feeling kinda icky-poo last week, but not as bad as I was before it was hanging on.

02:48:25.655 --> 02:48:53.350
[SPEAKER_07]: and then I thought my allergies were kicking in so I was like, oh great, I get over running 103 fever to, you know, having my allergies clear up then to have it settle into a cough on Friday and then having this doctor, one of the weekend doctors at Kaiser who saw me for 10 minutes said, it's the same crap he had before here, take this stuff with codeine in it and don't drive, which I have been because codeine doesn't do shit to me.

02:48:54.050 --> 02:48:54.991
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes a lot of it

02:48:55.529 --> 02:48:56.310
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I act drunk.

02:48:56.970 --> 02:48:57.531
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all it is.

02:48:58.231 --> 02:49:00.033
[SPEAKER_07]: So, F you to Dr. Huang.

02:49:00.053 --> 02:49:14.485
[SPEAKER_07]: F you to wanting ice cream really bad and not being able to have it because dairy products stick in mucus.

02:49:15.286 --> 02:49:22.872
[SPEAKER_07]: And I know it's really disgusting, but it's been to the point where I've woken up, wake up sometimes in the morning choking.

02:49:24.403 --> 02:49:53.524
[SPEAKER_07]: and then having major chest pains it feels like I've got asthma actually what it feels like for it feels like okay for people who are not of strong cardiovascular health try to run for a minute at five miles an hour and then the way that your chest feels that's how I feel all the time um a big F you goes to having my voice go in and out um by tomorrow I'm sure I won't have one which is good because if people try to talk to me I just go I can't talk bye um

02:49:56.196 --> 02:50:02.918
[SPEAKER_07]: and really, you know, a big F you to situations I can't do crap about as much as I would like to.

02:50:05.019 --> 02:50:13.201
[SPEAKER_07]: And then an F you to the person who was tailgating me on the way here.

02:50:14.101 --> 02:50:18.302
[SPEAKER_07]: I really felt like throwing all my brakes, but my car's in bad enough shape as it is.

02:50:18.782 --> 02:50:20.263
[SPEAKER_07]: An F you to the hot coming.

02:50:20.683 --> 02:50:24.444
[SPEAKER_07]: I was, you know, thinking it was pretty cool that it was all wintery and

02:50:24.932 --> 02:50:26.973
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, the temperature was nice outside.

02:50:27.073 --> 02:50:29.794
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it gets, like, warm.

02:50:29.974 --> 02:50:31.835
[SPEAKER_07]: It's supposed to be 74 degrees tomorrow.

02:50:32.516 --> 02:50:33.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck that.

02:50:33.076 --> 02:50:34.136
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it to stay in the 50s.

02:50:34.337 --> 02:50:35.597
[SPEAKER_07]: I want it cold.

02:50:35.897 --> 02:50:37.558
[SPEAKER_07]: Because my AC doesn't work.

02:50:39.219 --> 02:50:39.699
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:41.700
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah?

02:50:41.940 --> 02:50:46.582
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to Jinpachi Mishima for being a tough-ass bastard to beat.

02:50:48.143 --> 02:50:48.603
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it.

02:50:50.204 --> 02:50:51.845
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's move on to Loki.

02:50:53.306 --> 02:50:53.666
Okay.

02:50:53.766 --> 02:50:54.086
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

02:50:55.463 --> 02:51:14.234
[SPEAKER_21]: First off, fuck you to the movie White Noise, because it had a really weird ending to it, and also now because of that movie, I have no chance whatsoever to actually practice anything with EVP because the fiancé now forbids it, because I'm meddling.

02:51:15.419 --> 02:51:16.860
[SPEAKER_21]: Aw, no more portal to hell?

02:51:17.000 --> 02:51:19.222
[SPEAKER_21]: And we find out what happens to people who meddle.

02:51:19.502 --> 02:51:25.427
[SPEAKER_21]: They get their bones broken and their entire body and then thrown off a building by three evil spirits.

02:51:26.608 --> 02:51:27.549
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, gave away the end.

02:51:27.809 --> 02:51:28.170
[SPEAKER_21]: Damn.

02:51:29.631 --> 02:51:36.757
[SPEAKER_21]: Anyways, and then fuck you to the guy game.

02:51:38.064 --> 02:51:38.364
[SPEAKER_21]: Why?

02:51:38.684 --> 02:51:50.671
[SPEAKER_21]: Because the guy game, for some reason, freezes up whenever I try to do Tier 3, and now I can't progress any further and unlock any other women or see more boobies, because I'm stuck now, because it will not load Tier 3.

02:51:51.292 --> 02:51:53.233
[SPEAKER_21]: Goddammit, that sucks.

02:51:54.814 --> 02:51:58.196
[SPEAKER_20]: Did you ever think maybe that could be remedied by buying a legit copy of the game?

02:51:58.797 --> 02:51:59.617
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, too bad they don't sell it.

02:51:59.817 --> 02:52:00.998
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, well, damn.

02:52:01.298 --> 02:52:05.940
[SPEAKER_21]: No, what I'm going to do is I'm going to find a save file for it that's everything unlocked, and then I'll just build a bypass and all that.

02:52:06.480 --> 02:52:15.444
[SPEAKER_21]: And then also, fuck you to this woman we spoke to at the Hazelwood apartment.

02:52:15.604 --> 02:52:18.485
[SPEAKER_21]: She was talking to us like we were retarded.

02:52:18.906 --> 02:52:23.828
[SPEAKER_21]: Talking very slowly and in a southern accent.

02:52:24.408 --> 02:52:25.889
[SPEAKER_21]: And I just wanted to smack her.

02:52:27.808 --> 02:52:31.489
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so busy right now.

02:52:31.909 --> 02:52:32.569
[SPEAKER_21]: Fucking hate him.

02:52:33.590 --> 02:52:43.393
[SPEAKER_21]: And finally, fuck you to the reanimated head of Walt Disney for eating all those stupid children.

02:52:44.113 --> 02:52:45.133
[SPEAKER_21]: What did they ever do to you?

02:52:49.455 --> 02:52:50.815
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I guess it's my turn.

02:52:58.485 --> 02:53:03.528
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to the fact that I'm so sore today because I slept on that mattress or that fold-out bed last night.

02:53:03.988 --> 02:53:08.951
[SPEAKER_20]: I should have just let the two guys who wanted to make out all night long sleep on the things.

02:53:08.991 --> 02:53:09.651
[SPEAKER_20]: They could have that.

02:53:10.011 --> 02:53:12.653
[SPEAKER_20]: And I should have taken the nice fluffy mattress that was on the ground.

02:53:12.673 --> 02:53:16.435
[SPEAKER_20]: But I was kind of stupid and I just took the first comfy thing that looked available.

02:53:16.515 --> 02:53:19.837
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm very thankful to the person who let us stay there.

02:53:19.917 --> 02:53:21.317
[SPEAKER_20]: So I can't really bitch too much.

02:53:21.397 --> 02:53:22.638
[SPEAKER_20]: But F you to pain.

02:53:22.718 --> 02:53:23.679
[SPEAKER_20]: It hurts.

02:53:23.699 --> 02:53:25.480
[SPEAKER_20]: It hurts so bad.

02:53:27.570 --> 02:53:31.672
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to Drugs, because taking Tylenol helped make the pain go away.

02:53:31.752 --> 02:53:33.913
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm very thankful to that.

02:53:35.574 --> 02:53:39.036
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to the guy wearing the shirt that said they were against gay fraternities.

02:53:40.056 --> 02:53:42.157
[SPEAKER_20]: What did gay fraternities ever do to you?

02:53:42.798 --> 02:53:48.761
[SPEAKER_20]: Did they... I don't even want to know what they... Let people do what they want.

02:53:48.941 --> 02:53:50.501
[SPEAKER_20]: God, get your nose out of their business.

02:53:52.462 --> 02:53:52.863
[SPEAKER_20]: And then...

02:53:55.430 --> 02:54:02.895
[SPEAKER_20]: An FU to the fact that I also want ice cream, but I'm just too lazy to go get it.

02:54:04.796 --> 02:54:06.117
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, okay, cool.

02:54:09.979 --> 02:54:10.279
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:12.841
[SPEAKER_20]: That's it for my FUs.

02:54:13.001 --> 02:54:19.285
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back with the chatroom FUs right after we get to Angel and Arcadian's FUs.

02:54:20.205 --> 02:54:20.866
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's start with Angel.

02:54:22.119 --> 02:54:29.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to myself for having this weird-ass dream last night and waking myself up three hours after I went to bed.

02:54:29.904 --> 02:54:34.207
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I had to, like, I don't know, calm myself back down and go back over and go to bed.

02:54:34.227 --> 02:54:36.269
[SPEAKER_06]: That was just fucked up.

02:54:37.289 --> 02:54:40.412
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you to myself again for...

02:54:41.323 --> 02:54:47.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Realizing that, oh, I need to update my video drivers for Final Fantasy 7, but that's okay because I need to reinstall the damn thing anyway now.

02:54:48.688 --> 02:54:50.670
[SPEAKER_06]: So that kind of sucks.

02:54:51.690 --> 02:54:54.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, nothing else really.

02:54:54.893 --> 02:54:58.295
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pretty boring as usual, and yeah, you don't need to hear me anymore.

02:54:58.335 --> 02:54:58.735
[SPEAKER_06]: Goodbye!

02:54:59.976 --> 02:55:00.597
[SPEAKER_20]: Arcadian.

02:55:02.998 --> 02:55:09.383
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to the creeping broke crud that I've had just now going away after several weeks.

02:55:11.832 --> 02:55:15.233
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, let's see, uh, fuck you to Chosky being so far away.

02:55:15.253 --> 02:55:20.275
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just necessitating, necessitating a two-hour drive up the mountain that I did today.

02:55:21.055 --> 02:55:21.636
[SPEAKER_05]: Up to Reno.

02:55:22.756 --> 02:55:26.177
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to see some mysterious white substance that was on the ground in many places.

02:55:27.978 --> 02:55:32.699
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, that was... Oh, yes, there was crack all over the ground.

02:55:32.739 --> 02:55:34.500
[SPEAKER_05]: Came from the sky.

02:55:34.540 --> 02:55:36.261
[SPEAKER_20]: Yay, crack from the sky.

02:55:36.301 --> 02:55:37.181
[SPEAKER_20]: It's God's crack.

02:55:39.233 --> 02:55:48.959
[SPEAKER_05]: and then fuck you to car lights and at night, like, blinding me and my fucking windows for always getting all crud on and blinding me and all that kind of shit.

02:55:50.099 --> 02:55:51.040
[SPEAKER_20]: Jamie made it funny.

02:55:51.080 --> 02:55:52.801
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't pay attention to her.

02:55:53.601 --> 02:55:56.123
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying that God has dermatitis of the ass?

02:55:59.144 --> 02:56:00.385
[SPEAKER_20]: Just don't listen.

02:56:00.825 --> 02:56:01.786
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't listen to us, Arcadian.

02:56:01.806 --> 02:56:02.166
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm sorry.

02:56:04.584 --> 02:56:05.365
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's all.

02:56:05.885 --> 02:56:06.266
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

02:56:07.587 --> 02:56:08.407
[SPEAKER_21]: One more real quick.

02:56:09.088 --> 02:56:11.970
[SPEAKER_21]: Fuck you to Explicit for not picking up his DS.

02:56:12.230 --> 02:56:15.773
[SPEAKER_21]: We do have a policy that if it's not picked up within a month, it becomes ours.

02:56:17.074 --> 02:56:17.494
[SPEAKER_02]: So hurry up.

02:56:17.995 --> 02:56:22.679
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs because I know a lot of you guys have some rants tonight.

02:56:26.201 --> 02:56:30.184
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight would like Jamie to know that Jim Pocci is a hard-ass bastard.

02:56:30.605 --> 02:56:31.325
[SPEAKER_20]: He agrees with you there.

02:56:31.726 --> 02:56:32.446
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck yeah.

02:56:32.807 --> 02:56:33.267
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate him.

02:56:33.737 --> 02:56:36.898
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight also says... That's not a nice thing to say to Dark Knight.

02:56:36.998 --> 02:56:37.978
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight's a nice guy.

02:56:38.038 --> 02:56:39.319
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I like Dark Knight.

02:56:39.679 --> 02:56:40.699
[SPEAKER_07]: Dark Knight's my buddy.

02:56:41.179 --> 02:56:47.901
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm talking about Jinpachi with his... Well, you know why the mouth is in his... It's his cheap-ass fireball, isn't it?

02:56:47.921 --> 02:56:48.341
[SPEAKER_07]: I fucking hate that.

02:56:48.361 --> 02:56:49.642
[SPEAKER_07]: You know why the mouth is on his stomach?

02:56:50.522 --> 02:56:51.602
[SPEAKER_20]: His mouth is on his stomach.

02:56:51.642 --> 02:56:53.483
[SPEAKER_07]: Because your soul is stored in your belly.

02:56:55.521 --> 02:56:57.282
[SPEAKER_21]: I've got a lot of soul in me, then.

02:56:57.562 --> 02:56:59.064
[SPEAKER_07]: Remember Bishamon and Darkstalkers.

02:56:59.304 --> 02:56:59.964
[SPEAKER_07]: He was like that, too.

02:57:00.084 --> 02:57:02.266
[SPEAKER_19]: I need to lose some soul, if that's the case.

02:57:02.926 --> 02:57:06.048
[SPEAKER_07]: But he's possessed, so the possession is on his tummy.

02:57:07.109 --> 02:57:08.770
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Bishamon and Darkstalkers.

02:57:08.810 --> 02:57:13.033
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure, he just didn't have, like, a really bad taco or anything, and, like, Taco Bell.

02:57:13.113 --> 02:57:15.595
[SPEAKER_20]: Sometimes my stomach feels like that after a night at Taco Bell.

02:57:17.977 --> 02:57:18.877
[SPEAKER_07]: He ate it, gym boys.

02:57:19.057 --> 02:57:21.179
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like my stomach suddenly becomes the grudge.

02:57:25.499 --> 02:57:30.420
[SPEAKER_20]: Dark Knight says, F you to the many evil corporations in the US that treat its employees like shit.

02:57:31.060 --> 02:57:32.100
[SPEAKER_20]: Quote the Raven, nevermore.

02:57:34.621 --> 02:57:38.542
[SPEAKER_20]: Dork says, F you to this damn bitch at work for saying she'll get me fired.

02:57:38.902 --> 02:57:40.902
[SPEAKER_20]: One, I could give a shit if I lose this job or not.

02:57:40.982 --> 02:57:44.103
[SPEAKER_20]: And two, why the fuck are you going to complain to my boss about me telling you the truth?

02:57:44.563 --> 02:57:46.704
[SPEAKER_20]: If you can't handle the truth, don't fucking ask.

02:57:47.184 --> 02:57:48.224
[SPEAKER_20]: And again, F you to girls.

02:57:50.524 --> 02:57:51.865
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, F you back, buddy.

02:57:53.285 --> 02:57:53.665
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kidding.

02:57:54.275 --> 02:57:57.558
[SPEAKER_20]: AseanBuddy Paul says, F you to my Spanish 3 class.

02:57:57.938 --> 02:58:03.323
[SPEAKER_20]: If I do any more Spanish, I'll no longer be allowed to check the Asian Pacific Islander box on applications.

02:58:06.386 --> 02:58:09.628
[SPEAKER_20]: Vandalist says, F you to California's real estate prices.

02:58:09.809 --> 02:58:10.509
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God, yes.

02:58:10.870 --> 02:58:15.033
[SPEAKER_20]: And F you to Nashville for showing me that a lavish house and acreage doesn't have to cost over 700K.

02:58:15.073 --> 02:58:15.393
[SPEAKER_20]: I feel sad.

02:58:20.764 --> 02:58:32.373
[SPEAKER_20]: BigSuperSSJ100FU to Destination TV for screwing me out of an internship and trying to use me to steal equipment from my film school and using me for slave labor.

02:58:33.134 --> 02:58:40.280
[SPEAKER_20]: FU to MesaGolfland Beatmania2DX players and Danbury Connecticut DDR players for being hissy fit people who don't like people lesser than them.

02:58:41.982 --> 02:58:43.703
[SPEAKER_20]: That's quite a big scope of the country there.

02:58:44.488 --> 02:58:55.522
[SPEAKER_20]: Sephiroth 1215 says, F you to the stupid people who think they are so good at DDR because they can do 1.10 even though all they can play on 1.5 and they won't let anyone they don't know play.

02:58:59.106 --> 02:59:02.851
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, if you can beat Bag on 3 speed, that's really only like a 9, that's not a 10.

02:59:05.819 --> 02:59:09.266
[SPEAKER_20]: DJ Ranma S says, F you to people who don't know how to use iPods.

02:59:10.729 --> 02:59:14.837
[SPEAKER_20]: RTFM, read the fucking manual first before you return the pod, you ass.

02:59:15.433 --> 02:59:19.415
[SPEAKER_20]: and FU to Best Buy for not giving recognition to us grunts in the Geek Squad.

02:59:19.795 --> 02:59:22.516
[SPEAKER_20]: We fix computers, check TVs, and do customer service.

02:59:22.877 --> 02:59:24.037
[SPEAKER_20]: We want some props too.

02:59:24.357 --> 02:59:24.497
[SPEAKER_20]: Ugh.

02:59:25.138 --> 02:59:30.820
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I saw... Actually, I was driving down the road the other day and I saw one of those Geek Squad cars and that just made me laugh.

02:59:30.880 --> 02:59:32.881
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm like, that's such a sitcom waiting to happen.

02:59:33.342 --> 02:59:36.103
[SPEAKER_19]: Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Geek Squad!

02:59:36.123 --> 02:59:40.565
[SPEAKER_21]: You know what's sad enough is I'd be doing that if I was actually accredited.

02:59:44.227 --> 02:59:44.347
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

02:59:47.617 --> 02:59:51.240
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I think I only got like half of IllusionsFU because it starts like this.

02:59:51.720 --> 02:59:54.183
[SPEAKER_20]: My friend and I go to IHOP anyway, half an hour late.

02:59:54.243 --> 02:59:55.083
[SPEAKER_20]: My friend isn't there.

02:59:55.484 --> 02:59:59.047
[SPEAKER_20]: I call my friend and he says that my friend Esteban would be coming back to IHOP.

02:59:59.067 --> 03:00:00.668
[SPEAKER_20]: So we just eat at IHOP and wait for him.

03:00:01.109 --> 03:00:04.050
[SPEAKER_20]: We eat our meals and after the meal my coupon doesn't work.

03:00:04.090 --> 03:00:06.492
[SPEAKER_20]: The coupon gave me a free meal because I bought appetizers.

03:00:06.952 --> 03:00:09.373
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't bring that much money so I'm totally scrounging for change.

03:00:09.453 --> 03:00:10.473
[SPEAKER_20]: There goes most of my money.

03:00:10.934 --> 03:00:16.676
[SPEAKER_20]: We walk to Shakey's and this crazy guy comes off the freeway, scares us and we run for our lives as he chases after us.

03:00:17.277 --> 03:00:26.401
[SPEAKER_20]: We get to Shakey's and after all that crap I find that they had just taken the DDR machine out and my friend had waited around for us an hour and a half thus making it the worst weekend ever.

03:00:30.816 --> 03:00:32.978
[SPEAKER_20]: Wait till you get a job and work full time.

03:00:34.339 --> 03:00:35.900
[SPEAKER_20]: Then every weekend's the worst weekend ever.

03:00:35.920 --> 03:00:37.041
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I'm kidding.

03:00:37.381 --> 03:00:39.803
[SPEAKER_20]: RPGKing7 says, F you to being unemployed.

03:00:39.843 --> 03:00:44.307
[SPEAKER_20]: It really sucks and I've tried everywhere in my town and the next two towns over and no jobs.

03:00:45.108 --> 03:00:46.068
[SPEAKER_20]: Unemployment sucks.

03:00:48.590 --> 03:00:51.573
[SPEAKER_20]: John Field says, F you to my grandfather dying, crying.

03:00:51.753 --> 03:00:54.595
[SPEAKER_20]: F you to my laziness this week when I have a paper due this Tuesday.

03:00:55.136 --> 03:00:56.797
[SPEAKER_20]: That grandfather F you goes to cancer.

03:00:56.937 --> 03:00:57.838
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry to hear about it, bud.

03:00:58.118 --> 03:01:00.280
[SPEAKER_20]: Hope things are okay.

03:01:01.260 --> 03:01:01.640
[SPEAKER_20]: And that's it.

03:01:01.660 --> 03:01:02.521
[SPEAKER_20]: That was the last FU.

03:01:04.622 --> 03:01:08.524
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you to the chat room for playing along with the FUs of the week.

03:01:09.144 --> 03:01:09.725
[SPEAKER_20]: That's always fun.

03:01:10.485 --> 03:01:15.708
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we're going to do a quick two-song break, then we're going to come back to wrap stuff up here on Orange Lounge Radio.

03:01:16.188 --> 03:01:23.372
[SPEAKER_20]: In this break, I'm liking the Ultramix 2 thing, so we're going to do a song from Ultramix 2, and then maybe an older one from Ultramix 1.

03:01:23.432 --> 03:01:23.972
[SPEAKER_20]: How's that sound?

03:01:24.673 --> 03:01:26.614
[SPEAKER_20]: So we will be back after this.

03:01:28.875 --> 03:01:30.456
[SPEAKER_20]: I just have to figure out what song we're going to do first.

03:01:34.975 --> 03:01:40.640
[SPEAKER_20]: When we come back, we're going to wrap it up, tell you guys what to look forward to next week, and all that fun stuff.

03:01:41.561 --> 03:01:45.145
[SPEAKER_20]: However, I have to be able to successfully navigate my computer before we can get to a break.

03:01:46.286 --> 03:01:48.788
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm a folder challenge tonight, apparently.

03:01:49.569 --> 03:01:50.770
[SPEAKER_06]: Rob loses at the computer.

03:01:50.890 --> 03:01:53.252
[SPEAKER_20]: I totally lose.

03:01:53.813 --> 03:01:56.255
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's do a Max Remix, because we haven't done one of those in a while.

03:01:57.056 --> 03:01:57.897
[SPEAKER_20]: We'll be back after this.

03:03:21.668 --> 03:03:22.109
[SPEAKER_13]: and many more.

03:04:24.864 --> 03:04:28.787
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever question your life?

03:04:28.827 --> 03:04:30.608
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever wonder why?

03:04:31.528 --> 03:04:34.530
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you ever see in your dreams?

03:04:34.550 --> 03:04:36.211
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, can you see in the sky?

03:04:36.311 --> 03:04:37.032
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, tell me why

03:05:37.961 --> 03:05:42.805
[SPEAKER_14]: From Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

03:05:42.885 --> 03:05:43.326
[SPEAKER_14]: Holla!

03:05:43.366 --> 03:05:43.606
[SPEAKER_10]: P-T-P-O!

03:05:52.366 --> 03:05:53.246
[SPEAKER_20]: Thank you for watching!

03:06:20.217 --> 03:06:25.099
[SPEAKER_20]: RekkaCon, I'm going to try and make it out there if I can, because I do want to support that.

03:06:25.199 --> 03:06:26.619
[SPEAKER_20]: So we'll be out there, hopefully.

03:06:27.580 --> 03:06:29.440
[SPEAKER_20]: That happens in, what, two weeks, Angel?

03:06:29.460 --> 03:06:29.760
[SPEAKER_20]: Two weeks.

03:06:30.240 --> 03:06:31.221
[SPEAKER_20]: So I'm going to try and be out there.

03:06:32.761 --> 03:06:34.822
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll cosplay if I can get a purple wig and duct tape.

03:06:35.142 --> 03:06:36.382
[SPEAKER_20]: What are you going to cosplay as?

03:06:38.183 --> 03:06:39.584
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a purple wig and duct tape.

03:06:39.644 --> 03:06:42.004
[SPEAKER_20]: I want to cosplay as something, but it has to be easy.

03:06:42.044 --> 03:06:46.786
[SPEAKER_21]: I want to cosplay, if I were to cosplay at all, Dr. Cube.

03:06:47.871 --> 03:06:48.891
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that would rock.

03:06:48.911 --> 03:06:50.292
[SPEAKER_20]: That would so rock.

03:06:51.012 --> 03:06:51.332
[SPEAKER_20]: Maybe.

03:06:51.432 --> 03:06:53.033
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually found my Jill costume.

03:06:53.753 --> 03:07:00.195
[SPEAKER_07]: But one of my costumes is now retired because it is four sizes too big.

03:07:01.896 --> 03:07:02.176
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

03:07:02.196 --> 03:07:04.177
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, hey, that's the best reason to retire something.

03:07:05.037 --> 03:07:06.638
[SPEAKER_07]: Although I do still have my Emmy costume.

03:07:06.938 --> 03:07:07.318
[SPEAKER_20]: There you go.

03:07:07.558 --> 03:07:08.258
[SPEAKER_07]: I have the wig.

03:07:08.298 --> 03:07:08.938
[SPEAKER_07]: I have everything.

03:07:08.958 --> 03:07:10.719
[SPEAKER_20]: I should cosplay as Pantsless Rage.

03:07:11.226 --> 03:07:16.649
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I just, I had a vest for a Rage costume and I just threw it out.

03:07:17.209 --> 03:07:18.150
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, that's all right.

03:07:18.310 --> 03:07:18.810
[SPEAKER_07]: It wouldn't fit you.

03:07:20.591 --> 03:07:20.831
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well.

03:07:21.892 --> 03:07:25.594
[SPEAKER_20]: Anyway, so we got that coming up in future weeks on the show.

03:07:25.654 --> 03:07:28.535
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't forget to check out our podcast, www.orange.com.

03:07:28.555 --> 03:07:29.216
[SPEAKER_20]: Click on podcast.

03:07:29.256 --> 03:07:32.017
[SPEAKER_20]: It's us talking about other types of games, not just the Bomani games.

03:07:32.337 --> 03:07:32.898
[SPEAKER_20]: It's pretty cool.

03:07:33.398 --> 03:07:40.642
[SPEAKER_20]: And what's very interesting is that we thought we were going to be famous because we actually got contacted by a reporter for a pretty big newspaper in the area.

03:07:41.127 --> 03:07:42.549
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

03:07:56.340 --> 03:07:56.640
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, well.

03:07:57.161 --> 03:07:58.341
[SPEAKER_20]: So keep supporting our podcast.

03:07:58.381 --> 03:07:59.782
[SPEAKER_20]: Our podcast has been doing very well.

03:07:59.802 --> 03:08:00.783
[SPEAKER_20]: We're very happy about that.

03:08:00.843 --> 03:08:03.305
[SPEAKER_20]: So that's going to continue to grow and just be something else here at Orange Lounge.

03:08:03.325 --> 03:08:07.107
[SPEAKER_21]: I wanted to go to, like, PhantomCon, but it's so close to E3.

03:08:07.127 --> 03:08:16.673
[SPEAKER_21]: It's like, I think that, like, you know, previous, you know, two years ago was like the last time that I've gone, and I think that's probably the last time I will go.

03:08:16.813 --> 03:08:17.994
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want to go pretty bad, too.

03:08:18.034 --> 03:08:19.315
[SPEAKER_21]: I found my photos from front of me.

03:08:19.415 --> 03:08:21.216
[SPEAKER_20]: Even though E3 is right there, I still want to go.

03:08:21.236 --> 03:08:25.319
[SPEAKER_21]: The only reason that I go to those things anymore is just Studio Sudoku.

03:08:25.339 --> 03:08:25.459
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

03:08:26.179 --> 03:08:32.282
[SPEAKER_21]: I fucking love ReDeath and Fanboy Bebop and Nescaflonate.

03:08:32.702 --> 03:08:34.963
[SPEAKER_21]: That is the reason why I go to Fanime right there.

03:08:35.844 --> 03:08:38.745
[SPEAKER_21]: So, it'll be fun.

03:08:39.326 --> 03:08:54.673
[SPEAKER_21]: And besides, the dealer's room calls to me and it calls to my wallet and it, you know, I buy Gundam models there every time and I still have three that I haven't built yet and I really, you know, I can't afford it.

03:08:56.235 --> 03:08:58.136
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up, guys.

03:08:58.196 --> 03:09:01.639
[SPEAKER_20]: It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Angel.

03:09:02.479 --> 03:09:04.600
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn this level on WarioWare Touched.

03:09:04.741 --> 03:09:05.341
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Fantasy?

03:09:05.381 --> 03:09:06.982
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, what the hell was I trying to say there?

03:09:07.382 --> 03:09:08.363
[SPEAKER_20]: Addict, Arcadian.

03:09:09.544 --> 03:09:09.984
[SPEAKER_20]: Final thought.

03:09:10.004 --> 03:09:12.786
[SPEAKER_05]: It's good to see the mountains again.

03:09:14.067 --> 03:09:14.767
[SPEAKER_20]: Loki, your final thought.

03:09:17.416 --> 03:09:22.218
[SPEAKER_21]: and Goddammit, that bag of gummy bears is going to be gone pretty soon.

03:09:23.478 --> 03:09:26.059
[SPEAKER_20]: My final thought is, mmm, gummy bears.

03:09:27.200 --> 03:09:27.780
[SPEAKER_20]: DarkSakura.

03:09:28.700 --> 03:09:29.701
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob.

03:09:29.821 --> 03:09:30.021
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

03:09:31.381 --> 03:09:38.103
[SPEAKER_20]: And remember, folks, you ever heard of a joke getting old?

03:09:38.564 --> 03:09:38.764
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

03:09:40.104 --> 03:09:41.104
[SPEAKER_21]: Really, Rob?

03:09:42.565 --> 03:09:44.186
[SPEAKER_21]: There's another thing I've got to point out to everyone.

03:09:44.226 --> 03:09:45.286
[SPEAKER_21]: This is very important.

03:09:45.649 --> 03:09:46.910
[SPEAKER_21]: Peeps are now on sale.

03:09:46.990 --> 03:09:49.170
[SPEAKER_21]: Go to your local grocery store and buy them.

03:09:49.190 --> 03:09:53.472
[SPEAKER_20]: It is peep season, and remember, we here at Orange Lounge Radio endorse the peep jousting.

03:09:53.552 --> 03:09:55.153
[SPEAKER_20]: Ooh, we gotta do that again.

[SPEAKER_20]: Check that out.
