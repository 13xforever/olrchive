00:00:00,482 --> 00:00:03,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 28th, 2005.

2
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:15,913
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

3
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:20,556
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:21,997 --> 00:00:31,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello everybody, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast which you've subscribed to where we talk about video games that don't suck.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,340
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, sadly some that do because they just sneak in there.

6
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,822
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think tonight we got a lot of games to talk about that don't suck.

7
00:00:40,322 --> 00:00:44,563
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky, I'll be helping you make your way through this show.

8
00:00:44,643 --> 00:00:49,524
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always, the lovely DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:50,319 --> 00:00:51,079
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi!

10
00:00:51,599 --> 00:00:52,919
[SPEAKER_02]: The perky Jamie Summers.

11
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:54,200
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just faking it.

12
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,820
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

13
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Angsty as always, huh?

14
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:58,601
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.

15
00:00:58,961 --> 00:00:59,241
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

16
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:01,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, say hello to Loki.

17
00:01:01,821 --> 00:01:02,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

18
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,742
[SPEAKER_02]: And how's that DS charger you've been working on?

19
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:07,402
[SPEAKER_02]: You were working on it during the three hour show.

20
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:10,603
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on step six of twelve.

21
00:01:10,783 --> 00:01:11,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

22
00:01:11,423 --> 00:01:15,143
[SPEAKER_02]: For those that don't know, he's building a DS charger out of Legos.

23
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, explain how this works, Loki.

24
00:01:18,425 --> 00:01:33,257
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, it's got the charging cord built into it, and you just set the charger down, or set the DS down on the charger like a, you know, a dock, and there you go, and it holds like, well, six games and three styluses.

25
00:01:34,057 --> 00:01:36,539
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh, and this is all something you found on a website?

26
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:38,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I browse a lot of forums.

27
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:39,581
[SPEAKER_02]: God bless the internet.

28
00:01:40,562 --> 00:01:45,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I like this idea of making your own cases out of Legos, it's a brilliant concept.

29
00:01:46,451 --> 00:01:50,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into what's going on in our own personal gaming world this week.

30
00:01:50,434 --> 00:01:54,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, the PSP launched this past week.

31
00:01:54,616 --> 00:01:59,619
[SPEAKER_02]: I know somebody in here has got to have had to put their hands on one at some point, and I know it was probably DarkSakura.

32
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I right?

33
00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:04,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

34
00:02:06,204 --> 00:02:07,064
[SPEAKER_02]: Your voice is cracking.

35
00:02:08,025 --> 00:02:09,346
[SPEAKER_02]: What has been going on in your gaming world?

36
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:11,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Silent Hill 3.

37
00:02:11,427 --> 00:02:12,007
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of it.

38
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:12,788
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the PSP?

39
00:02:13,846 --> 00:02:18,931
[SPEAKER_01]: and no, because somebody else has been playing his new limb.

40
00:02:20,952 --> 00:02:23,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone who will not be named Dan.

41
00:02:23,875 --> 00:02:24,195
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry.

42
00:02:24,795 --> 00:02:26,277
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, or not named fiancÃ©.

43
00:02:26,357 --> 00:02:26,517
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

44
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:28,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Or hetero life partner.

45
00:02:31,501 --> 00:02:31,821
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

46
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:35,965
[SPEAKER_02]: So you haven't really had a chance to play the PSP at all?

47
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:37,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I played it.

48
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:38,727
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Darkstalkers.

49
00:02:38,827 --> 00:02:39,388
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of it?

50
00:02:39,873 --> 00:02:40,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Darkstalkers.

51
00:02:41,153 --> 00:02:41,934
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually really cool.

52
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:42,894
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the PSP?

53
00:02:42,934 --> 00:02:44,135
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really curious your thoughts.

54
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:45,495
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really awesome.

55
00:02:45,675 --> 00:02:54,078
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the little LED HD screen thingy and plays movies and MP3s and screw the iPod.

56
00:02:54,938 --> 00:02:56,679
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, I still like my iPod.

57
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,520
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but see where you paid $400 for your iPod?

58
00:02:59,580 --> 00:02:59,960
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid $300.

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,801
[SPEAKER_02]: We paid $250 for the... Whatever.

60
00:03:03,121 --> 00:03:03,241
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

61
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:03,301
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

62
00:03:12,351 --> 00:03:14,132
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura is your favorite out of the five?

63
00:03:14,892 --> 00:03:18,715
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only one I've played, but I really, really, really, really, really like Ridge Racer.

64
00:03:19,716 --> 00:03:21,778
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty, and it has Reiko in it, so it's all good.

65
00:03:22,318 --> 00:03:22,598
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

66
00:03:23,699 --> 00:03:25,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

67
00:03:27,762 --> 00:03:29,664
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Final Fantasy XI for ten minutes.

68
00:03:29,684 --> 00:03:31,345
[SPEAKER_02]: You're cutting back, huh?

69
00:03:32,917 --> 00:03:35,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Final Fantasy XI story tonight.

70
00:03:35,318 --> 00:03:35,979
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty interesting.

71
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,859
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll get to it in a minute.

72
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,382
[SPEAKER_02]: But first, Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world besides the DS Charger?

73
00:03:41,462 --> 00:03:44,464
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing a ton of games, actually.

74
00:03:44,685 --> 00:03:49,208
[SPEAKER_03]: I bought God of War, which I've been playing a lot of that.

75
00:03:49,668 --> 00:03:50,589
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really awesome.

76
00:03:50,609 --> 00:03:53,150
[SPEAKER_02]: They're calling that the Ninja Gaiden of PS2.

77
00:03:53,471 --> 00:03:54,151
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

78
00:03:54,211 --> 00:03:56,173
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's very, very similar to...

79
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,240
[SPEAKER_03]: Devil May Cry 3 Devil May Cry 3

80
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:33,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It basically looks like Lord of the Rings, you know, where you have him, he's just like tossing armies in the air and just like stuff like that.

81
00:04:33,902 --> 00:04:38,625
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's fireballs and crap that he's throwing, hitting like buildings nearby you and stuff and you're running.

82
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:47,150
[SPEAKER_03]: There's another part where you have to go to the Temple of Pandora, which is on the back of a titan, a giant like, you know, monster type thing.

83
00:04:47,574 --> 00:04:53,355
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you're climbing around the castle, they'll show scenes where you can see the titans walking and everything.

84
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,416
[SPEAKER_03]: Just tons of detail.

85
00:04:55,436 --> 00:04:57,856
[SPEAKER_02]: And, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's nudity in this game.

86
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:01,237
[SPEAKER_03]: There is full frontal nudity, and there's a sex minigame.

87
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:01,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome!

88
00:05:02,297 --> 00:05:03,218
[SPEAKER_03]: So you gotta love that.

89
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:06,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's violent and bloody as hell.

90
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,139
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really cool, they've got these...

91
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,541
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

92
00:05:27,847 --> 00:05:28,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, alright.

93
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:32,451
[SPEAKER_03]: So, definitely, highly recommend, you know, going out and getting that game.

94
00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:32,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's awesome.

95
00:05:33,332 --> 00:05:38,096
[SPEAKER_03]: The other game I got was, um, TimeSplitter 3 because I just love the TimeSplitter series.

96
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:43,380
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how they have, they have actually gotten really good with it because the first game's story mode sucked.

97
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:44,641
[SPEAKER_03]: Second game, it was pretty good.

98
00:05:44,762 --> 00:05:47,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Third game, story mode's pretty good, actually.

99
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:51,307
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, they've got a lot of stuff that's, um, been added to it.

100
00:05:51,347 --> 00:05:54,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a lot of, like, you know, um...

101
00:05:56,030 --> 00:05:57,931
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of different elements into it.

102
00:05:57,951 --> 00:06:00,331
[SPEAKER_03]: 150 playable characters that you can unlock through the entire game.

103
00:06:00,811 --> 00:06:08,573
[SPEAKER_03]: And like TimeSplitters, the other games, they have a challenge mode where you play these mini-games that are really off-the-wall strange.

104
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:16,896
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything from survival in a haunted house thing to shooting off heads, breaking windows, driving a cat, and playing hoops.

105
00:06:17,656 --> 00:06:18,336
[SPEAKER_03]: Driving a cat?

106
00:06:18,396 --> 00:06:19,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Driving a cat.

107
00:06:19,216 --> 00:06:19,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

108
00:06:19,716 --> 00:06:20,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cat with wheels on it.

109
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:21,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

110
00:06:21,597 --> 00:06:22,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just driving a cat.

111
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:23,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Cat racing game.

112
00:06:24,038 --> 00:06:25,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it, but that's what it is.

113
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:30,923
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got, supposedly, there's a thing that hints a Tony Hawk type game that's in there.

114
00:06:31,743 --> 00:06:35,044
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like it's so immersive and there's so many characters you can play.

115
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:42,427
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, one of the things that sets Time Sleuthers apart from other games is the ability to make your own deathmatch maps.

116
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:45,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Really good system that's only gotten better.

117
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:52,391
[SPEAKER_03]: Online gameplay for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube probably not, but online gameplay for those.

118
00:06:52,984 --> 00:07:18,868
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that'll be pretty interesting and um just like I said the story mode's awesome it's very very well done like the graphics and everything a lot of fun actually all right and then of course you know the other two games I had of course were the ones I mentioned last week Gran Turismo 4 which I haven't really played much of and then Dog's Life which I must say that this dog is wandering through a world of the most lazy people I've ever seen

119
00:07:19,261 --> 00:07:37,272
[SPEAKER_03]: That want this dog to like perform miracles for them And I'm like, god damn it This girl's like, I want you to build me a snowman I'm like, it's a fucking dog It doesn't do snowmen, what the hell So I threw poop at her Okay, that's a dog wood So have you played any games you don't like lately?

120
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:46,478
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like you're really enjoying all these games Um No I really did like God of War and stuff And um

121
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:50,564
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnout 3 or something, you know, that'd be pretty cool.

122
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:18,527
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still like it.

123
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:22,450
[SPEAKER_03]: I just have to get into it and play it some more and I'll love it again.

124
00:08:22,831 --> 00:08:23,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

125
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,333
[SPEAKER_02]: In my gaming world, not a whole lot new.

126
00:08:26,453 --> 00:08:31,177
[SPEAKER_02]: I've still been playing Zelda Minish Cap and I'm almost done with it, but that's pretty much been taking a lot of my time.

127
00:08:31,557 --> 00:08:36,461
[SPEAKER_02]: However, I did get to get my grubby little paws on the PSP that Dan has.

128
00:08:36,981 --> 00:08:44,286
[SPEAKER_02]: For about seven minutes or so, I got to play either... Now, there's a little controversy over how this game is pronounced.

129
00:08:44,326 --> 00:08:45,968
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either Lumines or Luminous.

130
00:08:46,708 --> 00:08:51,031
[SPEAKER_02]: and I guess Luminous is probably the more proper one, but a lot of you have probably been calling this game Luminous.

131
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:54,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to play this game for about seven minutes, loved every minute of it.

132
00:08:54,753 --> 00:08:56,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, that game is hot, I really want a PSP.

133
00:08:58,456 --> 00:08:59,176
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

134
00:09:28,345 --> 00:09:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some gaming news going on.

135
00:09:30,406 --> 00:09:34,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off with the PSP, since of course there's a lot of stuff going on with the PSP.

136
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:39,129
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them being the dead pixels going on with the PSPs.

137
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:46,332
[SPEAKER_02]: You've probably heard of this, maybe this happened to one of your friends, but a lot of these PSPs apparently have dead pixels, or do they?

138
00:09:46,832 --> 00:09:49,814
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony is responding to the reports going on right now.

139
00:09:51,835 --> 00:09:53,856
[SPEAKER_02]: It's commonly referred to as a defect.

140
00:09:54,016 --> 00:09:59,159
[SPEAKER_02]: However, Sony is saying that this is a problem that actually happens in all LCD screens.

141
00:09:59,619 --> 00:10:07,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Says Sony, a very small number of dark pixels or continuously lit pixels is normal for LCD screens and is not a sign of malfunction.

142
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:11,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Page 13 of the PSP manual says this.

143
00:10:11,823 --> 00:10:17,146
[SPEAKER_02]: Red, blue, or green spots or black spots may appear in certain locations on the LCD screen.

144
00:10:17,546 --> 00:10:23,709
[SPEAKER_02]: The appearance of such spots is a normal occurrence associated with LCD screens and not a sign of malfunction.

145
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:26,465
[SPEAKER_02]: So what should you do if this is happening to you?

146
00:10:27,326 --> 00:10:38,775
[SPEAKER_02]: They're suggesting that you try this out for a week or two, but if it continues to bother you, then you can use your one-year warranty that comes with the PSP.

147
00:10:39,216 --> 00:10:42,519
[SPEAKER_02]: All the details are on page 125 of the manual.

148
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's funny?

149
00:10:43,379 --> 00:10:43,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

150
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:49,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear, I've got this game system called the DS that has two LCD screens.

151
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:49,789
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess what?

152
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:50,811
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't happen there.

153
00:10:51,031 --> 00:10:52,073
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does it happen on yours?

154
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:54,618
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but you know what's weird is I have heard of it happening on the DS.

155
00:10:54,678 --> 00:10:55,519
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's not happening on yours.

156
00:10:55,559 --> 00:10:56,401
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

157
00:10:57,351 --> 00:11:02,137
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not a common thing because I have a LCD screen at work.

158
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:03,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you this much.

159
00:11:03,679 --> 00:11:05,341
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it on for a long time.

160
00:11:05,361 --> 00:11:07,483
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have any dead pixels in there.

161
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:09,266
[SPEAKER_03]: My DS doesn't have any dead pixels in it.

162
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:11,769
[SPEAKER_03]: My Game Boy Advance didn't have any dead pixels in it.

163
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does your PSPs have a lot of dead pixels in it?

164
00:11:14,472 --> 00:11:15,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're using chip.

165
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:18,131
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens with HDTVs all the time.

166
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:18,251
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I...

167
00:11:37,319 --> 00:11:50,666
[SPEAKER_02]: The advice I heard, and we were talking about this on the three hour program, Dan the man was here talking about the PSP, try putting in the movie that most of you guys got with your PSP, put in Spider-Man and try watching it and see if that unfreezes the pixel.

168
00:11:51,407 --> 00:11:52,668
[SPEAKER_02]: Just try different tricks like that.

169
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:55,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Try doing something a little different and maybe it'll help.

170
00:11:55,909 --> 00:12:00,472
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we saved you some headache there if you're one of those folks that has the PSP or the dead pixel.

171
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,714
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope when I get mine though I never have this problem because that will make me sad.

172
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:09,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the PSP, very interesting.

173
00:12:09,113 --> 00:12:14,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Some folks are using Wipeout Pure to be browsing the internet.

174
00:12:15,494 --> 00:12:17,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, I know you love reading about the hack stuff.

175
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,435
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with this?

176
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,975
[SPEAKER_03]: They're using the Wipeout.

177
00:12:19,995 --> 00:12:22,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's a function in the game where you can actually view the website.

178
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:25,357
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the website's up right now or something.

179
00:12:25,757 --> 00:12:30,038
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people are actually using it as a proxy or a way to bounce off of it to...

180
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Visit other websites such as Slashdot and Hackaday where I'm guessing this probably was featured in an article.

181
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:41,478
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually found the link from Slashdot, but, you know.

182
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:44,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Slashdot steals from Hackaday all the time.

183
00:12:45,342 --> 00:12:48,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people that read Slashdot read Hackaday and yadda yadda yadda.

184
00:12:49,008 --> 00:12:49,848
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

185
00:12:51,029 --> 00:12:52,609
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everything works, though.

186
00:12:52,669 --> 00:12:55,690
[SPEAKER_02]: Some things don't work, like JavaScript, frames.

187
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:58,131
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you can't expect all that kind of stuff to work.

188
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:06,453
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently, you can actually use Google, because you can use the X button on the PSP, and it brings up a little keyboard, so you can use that to type in things.

189
00:13:07,734 --> 00:13:08,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting there.

190
00:13:09,435 --> 00:13:11,717
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's what you need to be doing on there.

191
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:15,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking up internet porn.

192
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,062
[SPEAKER_03]: See, now that would be cool if you can download stuff to the DS.

193
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:23,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Just infect your PSP with a Bonzi buddy.

194
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,506
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god, that would be hilarious.

195
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:29,569
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait for your PSP to get spyware.

196
00:13:29,649 --> 00:13:32,551
[SPEAKER_02]: How many days did it take them to install Linux on the PSP?

197
00:13:32,631 --> 00:13:33,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think they've done it yet.

198
00:13:33,812 --> 00:13:35,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, it's a miracle.

199
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, it's only coming, I mean, it takes a while.

200
00:13:37,488 --> 00:13:38,329
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like a couple days.

201
00:13:38,909 --> 00:13:39,409
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we'll see.

202
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:46,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, if you want more information on how to use Wipeout Pure's hidden web browser, head on over to this website.

203
00:13:46,473 --> 00:13:59,420
[SPEAKER_02]: It's www.fumanchu.com slash p-s-p-d-e-v They'll have all the information there on that.

204
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:01,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that website doesn't get crashed.

205
00:14:01,381 --> 00:14:04,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully it stays up there, but it's probably going to get hit with a lot of folks.

206
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:06,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

207
00:14:06,895 --> 00:14:13,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, going on in the PlayStation world, now this is a pretty big story, but we don't have a lot of information at this time.

208
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:16,682
[SPEAKER_02]: This was actually another article that was on Slashdot.

209
00:14:17,723 --> 00:14:21,185
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're saying that according to Japan Today, the U.S.

210
00:14:21,245 --> 00:14:25,749
[SPEAKER_02]: District Court in Oakland, California has ordered Sony and its U.S.

211
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:30,792
[SPEAKER_02]: unit to pay $90.7 million in damages to Immersion Corp.

212
00:14:31,093 --> 00:14:35,656
[SPEAKER_02]: for patent infringement over controllers used with PlayStation game consoles.

213
00:14:36,116 --> 00:14:52,181
[SPEAKER_02]: In the ruling, which was handed down Thursday, the federal court also ordered Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment America to stop selling the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles using DualShock controllers as well as more than 40 game software products.

214
00:14:52,461 --> 00:14:55,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting if this is actually coming to light.

215
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,002
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there could be a stay.

216
00:14:57,302 --> 00:14:57,762
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know.

217
00:14:57,802 --> 00:15:01,063
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all kind of developing right now, so we don't know.

218
00:15:01,203 --> 00:15:03,324
[SPEAKER_02]: This will certainly be something we hear about more this week.

219
00:15:04,264 --> 00:15:08,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But my first thought is, those PlayStation controllers have been around for like 10 years.

220
00:15:08,926 --> 00:15:11,027
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just now coming to be a patent issue?

221
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:11,747
[SPEAKER_02]: What's going on with that?

222
00:15:11,807 --> 00:15:14,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that really how slow our legal system is, or what?

223
00:15:14,468 --> 00:15:16,869
[SPEAKER_01]: I think patents are 15 years.

224
00:15:16,889 --> 00:15:18,610
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

225
00:15:18,630 --> 00:15:19,650
[SPEAKER_01]: Expiration on them.

226
00:15:20,390 --> 00:15:22,131
[SPEAKER_02]: But still, what is going on with that?

227
00:15:23,431 --> 00:15:24,332
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is going to hold?

228
00:15:24,492 --> 00:15:26,653
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think they're actually going to have to stop selling PlayStation?

229
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,373
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sony, no.

230
00:15:28,954 --> 00:15:32,495
[SPEAKER_01]: But... You never know.

231
00:15:32,984 --> 00:15:34,885
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need to work it out.

232
00:15:34,905 --> 00:15:35,705
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's always appeals.

233
00:15:35,725 --> 00:15:36,865
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to work it out.

234
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:07,017
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be kind of curious of why they waited so long, to be honest.

235
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:11,700
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some various online, multiplayer online news.

236
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three of them.

237
00:16:13,061 --> 00:16:15,443
[SPEAKER_02]: I promised we would do a story about Final Fantasy XI.

238
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:16,503
[SPEAKER_02]: This is kind of interesting.

239
00:16:16,864 --> 00:16:24,129
[SPEAKER_02]: This is only going to apply to the Japanese version of Final Fantasy XI, but they're going to be doing a campaign called the Welcome Back Campaign.

240
00:16:24,389 --> 00:16:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be going on from April 14th to July 13th, and if you are a retired Final Fantasy XI player,

241
00:16:30,593 --> 00:16:42,297
[SPEAKER_02]: Sign up on the game's official site and you can get your play online and Final Fantasy registration codes reissued by Squeenix, meaning that you can return to the game with your old characters intact.

242
00:16:43,197 --> 00:16:45,798
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll be able to play the game free for 30 days!

243
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,734
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're trying to sucker you back into the addicting world of Final Fantasy XI.

244
00:16:52,335 --> 00:17:00,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I know all you guys are currently in Final Fantasy XI, but let's say they reinstated this type of similar thing in a game that you've maybe left, like...

245
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:03,553
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura for you may be Ragnarok or PSO?

246
00:17:03,633 --> 00:17:04,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this something you'd jump on?

247
00:17:04,573 --> 00:17:10,635
[SPEAKER_01]: They've given free months, and I hadn't ever re-registered.

248
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:12,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think that's the main reason why they do this?

249
00:17:12,836 --> 00:17:17,318
[SPEAKER_01]: On Ragnarok Online, if you were in the second beta, you'd keep your character forever.

250
00:17:17,338 --> 00:17:17,938
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

251
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:23,520
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could go a year from now if I wanted to play RO again, and my character would still be there at her same levels.

252
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:24,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

253
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:25,341
[SPEAKER_02]: So...

254
00:17:26,556 --> 00:17:30,418
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think this is just something they're doing to sucker people back into it and get obsessed with Final Fantasy again?

255
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:30,759
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

256
00:17:31,699 --> 00:17:32,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably good business sense.

257
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:33,660
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what about you?

258
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,421
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of the idea?

259
00:17:34,441 --> 00:17:37,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're somebody who's still paying for Final Fantasy XI.

260
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,265
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a little ticked off that somebody else is going to get 30 free days just because they quit?

261
00:17:41,465 --> 00:17:41,865
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

262
00:17:42,025 --> 00:17:42,366
[SPEAKER_03]: Who cares?

263
00:17:44,127 --> 00:17:44,647
[SPEAKER_03]: I really don't.

264
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so what?

265
00:17:46,468 --> 00:17:47,208
[SPEAKER_03]: They get it for free.

266
00:17:47,368 --> 00:17:53,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's just like, you know, all those cable companies out there that, you know, hey, you get the movie channels for free if you, you know, join us.

267
00:17:53,551 --> 00:17:56,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Then people are like, ah, why are they doing that?

268
00:17:56,433 --> 00:18:01,195
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's actually retarded people out there that will actually quit and come back to get the free movie channels.

269
00:18:01,536 --> 00:18:02,376
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, you're an idiot.

270
00:18:02,476 --> 00:18:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: But whatever, you know, hey, try to get them back because, you know, they've got competition now with World of Warcraft and stuff.

271
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: So good luck.

272
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it's going to work.

273
00:18:12,103 --> 00:18:18,747
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of World of Warcraft, this week World of Warcraft was patched to version 1.3.0.

274
00:18:19,387 --> 00:18:28,452
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they've added, like chat bubbles, brand new chat bubbles, quest trackers, and a brand new dungeon, which is called Dire Maul.

275
00:18:28,552 --> 00:18:32,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I know that nobody here is that into World of Warcraft, but it's kind of neat.

276
00:18:33,074 --> 00:18:34,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's a very insanely popular game.

277
00:18:34,735 --> 00:18:42,079
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a game I still want to check out as soon as I officially part from Final Fantasy XI, because technically I'm still on it, but not much longer.

278
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:44,580
[SPEAKER_02]: I do want to check out at least World of Warcraft, give it a chance.

279
00:18:45,181 --> 00:18:54,486
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know it's insanely popular, so I'm sure this download, which is going to be 62 megabytes of a chat, a lot of folks are going to be really happy about this one.

280
00:18:55,106 --> 00:19:00,749
[SPEAKER_02]: They're saying that the chat bubbles are kind of like what you see in EverQuest 2, which should be very interesting.

281
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:00,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

282
00:19:02,013 --> 00:19:08,095
[SPEAKER_02]: The new area, by the way, the new dungeon, it's kind of interesting because it seems like whenever they put in new areas in a game, it's always for high levels.

283
00:19:08,575 --> 00:19:13,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're going to have to be level 56 to 60 if you want to get to this new area, Dire Maul.

284
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:21,139
[SPEAKER_02]: Also going on in other online RPGs, the Matrix Online finally started.

285
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,720
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just launched this week.

286
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we were talking on the last podcast about when the Matrix Online stopped its beta, did that pretty hilarious sign-off.

287
00:19:31,317 --> 00:19:33,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, tell me, Loki, I don't know how much you've heard about this.

288
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,440
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been following Matrix Online more than I have.

289
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:36,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it true?

290
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:42,024
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was reading something where they've actually hired people to be actors in the Matrix Online.

291
00:19:42,124 --> 00:19:42,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

292
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:46,527
[SPEAKER_02]: That is their job, to play this game and move the story.

293
00:19:46,968 --> 00:19:52,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're hired to play the main characters like Niobe, Morpheus, etc., etc., and they're hired to do that.

294
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:54,633
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

295
00:19:54,653 --> 00:19:54,713
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

296
00:19:54,909 --> 00:19:55,810
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to hire me.

297
00:19:56,130 --> 00:19:56,690
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, seriously.

298
00:19:56,710 --> 00:20:03,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this just makes me think, my gosh, now kids everywhere will be able to tell their parents, see, you can make a living playing video games.

299
00:20:04,835 --> 00:20:06,877
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, wow.

300
00:20:07,037 --> 00:20:09,278
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll also just ask any game tester, but still.

301
00:20:11,279 --> 00:20:15,802
[SPEAKER_02]: Still, though, there's a difference between game testing and then actually immersing yourself in this world.

302
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:16,363
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really.

303
00:20:17,463 --> 00:20:23,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to do that, you know, but I don't think that after a while it would get kind of old.

304
00:20:24,549 --> 00:20:28,092
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they switch characters once in a while, liven it up, or how they do that.

305
00:20:28,153 --> 00:20:28,773
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of weird.

306
00:20:28,813 --> 00:20:31,777
[SPEAKER_02]: I wonder if they're always on 24 hours a day, or what they do.

307
00:20:32,337 --> 00:20:33,478
[SPEAKER_02]: If they switch, I don't know.

308
00:20:33,639 --> 00:20:34,720
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be cool just playing Neo.

309
00:20:36,141 --> 00:20:39,024
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, apparently they do have Neo running around in there somewhere.

310
00:20:39,225 --> 00:20:39,925
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so.

311
00:20:39,965 --> 00:20:40,266
[SPEAKER_02]: He's dead.

312
00:20:41,472 --> 00:20:42,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I thought he was in there somewhere.

313
00:20:42,773 --> 00:20:44,573
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that he's spotted.

314
00:20:44,593 --> 00:20:45,453
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just a myth.

315
00:20:46,134 --> 00:20:48,394
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, how could they not?

316
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:49,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Dead or not?

317
00:20:49,635 --> 00:20:51,576
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, Freddy's died how many times?

318
00:20:51,596 --> 00:20:54,376
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll bring him back and then we'll do a fucking trilogy again.

319
00:20:54,617 --> 00:20:55,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.

320
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:57,918
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah.

321
00:20:58,358 --> 00:21:10,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this last bit of MMORPG news I have isn't quite exactly about the game itself, but the ramifications that getting really into an MMO can have.

322
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:20,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Sony Online Entertainment just sent some notice that there has been a baby named after a character in EverQuest.

323
00:21:21,376 --> 00:21:32,204
[SPEAKER_02]: Player Tabitha Ayers gave birth to a baby girl on January 6, 2005 and promptly named her Firiona Valle Ayers.

324
00:21:32,504 --> 00:21:37,188
[SPEAKER_03]: And these people right here should have their membership cancelled and they should be castrated.

325
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:41,652
[SPEAKER_02]: In honor of EverQuest's famous spokes-elf, um...

326
00:21:42,128 --> 00:21:42,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

327
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Named after an MMORPG character.

328
00:21:46,993 --> 00:21:47,093
[SPEAKER_02]: Loser.

329
00:21:47,233 --> 00:21:47,673
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?

330
00:21:50,155 --> 00:21:54,199
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, they named babies after rock stars and movie characters.

331
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,461
[SPEAKER_02]: And all those people should be castrated just as well.

332
00:21:56,701 --> 00:21:57,823
[SPEAKER_01]: And video game characters.

333
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,908
[SPEAKER_01]: There was someone that Dan knew that named their kid Melina.

334
00:22:04,509 --> 00:22:04,969
[SPEAKER_01]: Melina?

335
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:05,770
[SPEAKER_02]: Melina?

336
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:11,327
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually like the name Melina, but if I were to name my kid Melina, I wouldn't name it because of Mortal Kombat.

337
00:22:11,347 --> 00:22:15,088
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided that we're naming our first kid Richter.

338
00:22:16,709 --> 00:22:19,651
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this necessarily worse than that?

339
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:20,231
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

340
00:22:21,311 --> 00:22:22,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Although EverQuest is really stupid.

341
00:22:23,993 --> 00:22:26,474
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this kid's going to get teased.

342
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:33,037
[SPEAKER_01]: This person should have named their kid after a cool game instead of proving to the universe that they're an addict.

343
00:22:33,057 --> 00:22:34,278
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

344
00:22:34,338 --> 00:22:34,618
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.

345
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:41,200
[SPEAKER_02]: I might name... I always thought Strider was a good name for a guy, but not necessarily the same way.

346
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,601
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not really a name, it's a job.

347
00:22:43,742 --> 00:22:45,043
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also a name.

348
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:46,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew kids named that.

349
00:22:46,664 --> 00:22:48,505
[SPEAKER_02]: If you change the spelling, alter it a little bit.

350
00:22:50,466 --> 00:22:51,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

351
00:22:52,227 --> 00:22:56,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of an interesting story there that now kids are getting named after MMOs.

352
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:02,194
[SPEAKER_02]: But hey, if they name kids after rock stars in movies, I guess that's just a logical progression.

353
00:23:03,055 --> 00:23:03,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

354
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,303
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what did you pick to discuss tonight with our listeners?

355
00:23:06,323 --> 00:23:07,844
[SPEAKER_02]: This is how to escape from a bad date.

356
00:23:07,924 --> 00:23:08,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this is necessary.

357
00:23:08,624 --> 00:23:09,104
[SPEAKER_02]: This is good.

358
00:23:09,124 --> 00:23:09,805
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you do this?

359
00:23:09,845 --> 00:23:09,965
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

360
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:35,434
[SPEAKER_01]: You can fake an emergency.

361
00:23:36,534 --> 00:23:37,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse yourself from the table.

362
00:23:37,935 --> 00:23:40,516
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell your date that you are going to the restroom to wash up.

363
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:41,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your cell phone with you.

364
00:23:42,256 --> 00:23:45,598
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do not have one, locate a restaurant phone that's out of your date's line of vision.

365
00:23:46,418 --> 00:23:50,560
[SPEAKER_01]: Bring a restaurant matchbook or a business card that has a restaurant's phone number.

366
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,581
[SPEAKER_01]: Call a friend or relative for help.

367
00:23:52,821 --> 00:23:55,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell them to call you, either on your cell phone or on the restaurant's phone.

368
00:23:56,127 --> 00:23:57,709
[SPEAKER_01]: and pretend there has been an emergency.

369
00:23:57,789 --> 00:24:03,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Believable emergencies are personal crisis, my friend just broke up with her husband, she's having a breakdown, I have to go.

370
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:10,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Business crisis, my boss just called, she's in Seattle for a major presentation and has lost all of her files, I have to email them to her immediately.

371
00:24:11,542 --> 00:24:15,025
[SPEAKER_01]: Health crisis, my sister just called, our grandmother is alone and ill.

372
00:24:16,863 --> 00:24:18,664
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave quickly before your date can protest.

373
00:24:18,784 --> 00:24:22,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Apologize but refuse any attempt your date makes to accompany you.

374
00:24:22,747 --> 00:24:28,411
[SPEAKER_01]: If you leave swiftly and without hesitation, your date won't have time to understand what's happening or to object.

375
00:24:28,931 --> 00:24:30,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you slip away unnoticed.

376
00:24:31,173 --> 00:24:31,653
[SPEAKER_01]: Number 1.

377
00:24:32,193 --> 00:24:33,855
[SPEAKER_01]: Identify your escape route.

378
00:24:34,575 --> 00:24:35,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Observe your surroundings.

379
00:24:35,656 --> 00:24:40,119
[SPEAKER_01]: Take note of the exits, especially the back doors, for the best way out or an alternative.

380
00:24:41,054 --> 00:24:42,614
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.

381
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:42,614
[SPEAKER_01]: Plan to alter your appearance.

382
00:24:42,934 --> 00:24:46,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about your most distinctive features and figure out how to hide or disguise them.

383
00:24:46,875 --> 00:24:50,096
[SPEAKER_01]: The person you are trying to leave is going to see a figure moving past and away at a distance.

384
00:24:50,456 --> 00:24:52,076
[SPEAKER_01]: Only be focusing on that first impression.

385
00:24:52,637 --> 00:24:56,637
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not familiar to him and are uninteresting, you will not get a second look.

386
00:24:57,618 --> 00:24:56,637
3.

387
00:24:57,738 --> 00:24:58,858
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse yourself from the table.

388
00:24:58,918 --> 00:25:02,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Move to the restroom or any private area with a mirror to begin your transformation.

389
00:25:02,959 --> 00:25:07,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Your date will probably wait 2 or 3 minutes before expecting you to return, so act quickly before he begins looking for you.

390
00:25:09,313 --> 00:25:10,854
[SPEAKER_01]: 4.

391
00:25:09,793 --> 00:25:10,854
[SPEAKER_01]: Add or remove clothing.

392
00:25:11,274 --> 00:25:14,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Layering garments will change your body shape and even suggest a different gender.

393
00:25:14,917 --> 00:25:16,578
[SPEAKER_01]: A long coat will obscure your body type.

394
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:21,401
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a guy and you want to scare your date off, come back to the table wearing a dress.

395
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:26,604
[SPEAKER_01]: Hats are especially useful because they conceal your hair or facial features.

396
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,786
[SPEAKER_01]: Eyeglasses, whether added or removed, work wonders.

397
00:25:30,566 --> 00:25:33,568
[SPEAKER_01]: A shopping bag as hand is a handy prop and can be used to hold your belongings.

398
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,570
[SPEAKER_01]: 5.

399
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Change your walk and posture.

400
00:25:38,031 --> 00:25:40,951
[SPEAKER_01]: If you walk quickly and move slowly, you can stand up straight and hunch over.

401
00:25:42,232 --> 00:25:40,951
6.

402
00:25:43,212 --> 00:25:44,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Use or remove cosmetics.

403
00:25:44,412 --> 00:25:45,573
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.

404
00:25:45,593 --> 00:25:45,573
7.

405
00:25:45,633 --> 00:25:46,833
[SPEAKER_01]: Change your hairstyle or color.

406
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:49,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Rubber band, hairspray, water, gooey substance.

407
00:25:49,594 --> 00:25:50,114
[SPEAKER_01]: That will help.

408
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:50,114
8.

409
00:25:51,714 --> 00:25:52,735
[SPEAKER_01]: Adopt a cover roll.

410
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,496
[SPEAKER_01]: A waiter in the restaurant may have an apron and be carrying a tray.

411
00:25:55,556 --> 00:26:02,958
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can manage to procure these items, add or subtract a pair of eyeglasses and alter your hairline or hairstyle, you will become invisible by moving out of the restaurant.

412
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And put on a fake mustache.

413
00:26:04,574 --> 00:26:05,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Make your move.

414
00:26:05,595 --> 00:26:06,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not look at your date.

415
00:26:08,076 --> 00:26:09,297
[SPEAKER_01]: You can climb out of a window.

416
00:26:09,957 --> 00:26:14,680
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use things to break the window, such as a wastebasket, toilet plunger, handbag, or briefcase.

417
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,861
[SPEAKER_01]: You can even use a paper towel dispenser.

418
00:26:17,662 --> 00:26:19,103
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to hit it in the center, though.

419
00:26:19,923 --> 00:26:22,105
[SPEAKER_01]: Or, false fails, get your date to leave.

420
00:26:22,705 --> 00:26:23,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Say something offensive.

421
00:26:23,806 --> 00:26:24,846
[SPEAKER_01]: Behave inappropriately.

422
00:26:25,227 --> 00:26:27,028
[SPEAKER_01]: Send your date on a fool's errand.

423
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell him you want to go to a specific nightclub, but explain that it's very crowded and so he cannot go in after you.

424
00:26:35,779 --> 00:26:39,122
[SPEAKER_01]: But my advice in the end, don't go out with a loser.

425
00:26:40,063 --> 00:26:40,483
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

426
00:26:44,147 --> 00:26:45,788
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in gaming news this week.

427
00:26:46,108 --> 00:26:50,252
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, if I may say so, there was one on here for how to determine the gender of your date.

428
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:54,296
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to save that for a future advice column.

429
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:59,681
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur 3 is coming out, but it ain't coming out in the arcade.

430
00:27:00,686 --> 00:27:03,988
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though Link was so cool on the GameCube, it ain't coming out on the GameCube.

431
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:08,432
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a PlayStation 2 exclusive title, Soul Calibur 3.

432
00:27:09,352 --> 00:27:10,513
[SPEAKER_02]: Namco has announced it.

433
00:27:10,553 --> 00:27:12,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll come out later this year.

434
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:15,877
[SPEAKER_02]: So far, they've only announced three new characters.

435
00:27:17,338 --> 00:27:20,660
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to totally butcher the pronunciations of his name, so just deal with it.

436
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:21,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Tira...

437
00:27:22,108 --> 00:27:24,829
[SPEAKER_02]: Setsuka, and Zasamel.

438
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:26,930
[SPEAKER_02]: There's too many letters in that one.

439
00:27:27,631 --> 00:27:30,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Two returning characters will be coming back for sure as well.

440
00:27:30,712 --> 00:27:33,233
[SPEAKER_02]: Mitsurugi and Taki.

441
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:33,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Mitsurugi.

442
00:27:34,734 --> 00:27:36,035
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, I didn't play a lot of Soul Calibur.

443
00:27:36,175 --> 00:27:36,955
[SPEAKER_02]: I always played Ivy.

444
00:27:37,015 --> 00:27:38,396
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the easy to pronounce names.

445
00:27:39,936 --> 00:27:48,000
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a neat making of file that I didn't really get to watch because somebody else was watching it on his computer.

446
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe it was on GameSpot.

447
00:27:50,427 --> 00:27:55,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, what they're saying about Soul Calibur 3 is that you will be able to create your own character.

448
00:27:55,589 --> 00:27:58,209
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's going to be Barbie dress-up Soul Calibur, so that'll be fun.

449
00:27:58,229 --> 00:27:59,370
[SPEAKER_01]: That is totally up my alley.

450
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:07,452
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Zahamuel guy uses a scythe.

451
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:08,592
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

452
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,033
[SPEAKER_01]: I did see the pictures.

453
00:28:12,193 --> 00:28:13,814
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them looks just like Lulu.

454
00:28:14,334 --> 00:28:17,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Tira uses a giant chakram.

455
00:28:18,939 --> 00:28:22,160
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the one that looks just like Lulu from... No, it must be the other one.

456
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,762
[SPEAKER_02]: There's one, I swear, that looks just like Lulu from Final Fantasy X. Like when I saw the pictures.

457
00:28:26,782 --> 00:28:28,122
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going into some neat weaponry.

458
00:28:28,742 --> 00:28:29,262
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of neat.

459
00:28:29,562 --> 00:28:36,765
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's kind of a bummer because I really thought Soul Calibur was best on the GameCube and yes, 95% of that is because Link was in it.

460
00:28:37,165 --> 00:28:41,126
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of a bummer that... Well, actually... Actually, the Xbox one was really good.

461
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:42,086
[SPEAKER_02]: Back it up a little bit.

462
00:28:42,146 --> 00:28:44,187
[SPEAKER_02]: Soul Calibur II was really best in the arcade.

463
00:28:44,607 --> 00:28:48,068
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm really surprised that Soul Calibur III is not coming to the arcade.

464
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,380
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get that, but whatever.

465
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess really good news for Soul Calibur fans that have PlayStations.

466
00:28:56,684 --> 00:28:59,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and also the arcade market is kind of in a decline.

467
00:29:00,547 --> 00:29:00,967
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

468
00:29:01,087 --> 00:29:02,088
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of sad, though.

469
00:29:02,328 --> 00:29:08,934
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there were some really, like, I thought the Conquest idea was pretty neat and it kept people entertained and having your character being built on there.

470
00:29:09,094 --> 00:29:10,815
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of too bad.

471
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:12,577
[SPEAKER_02]: But there you have it.

472
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:15,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga's Ambition

473
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:31,273
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, the strategy.

474
00:29:31,433 --> 00:29:32,694
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you remember this game on Nintendo?

475
00:29:33,034 --> 00:29:37,435
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they're actually going to put out a brand new one on the PC this summer.

476
00:29:37,876 --> 00:29:45,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, this news is coming out of Japan, which, and the name when translated means Nobunaga's Ambition Revolution.

477
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,340
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to cost $107 in U.S.

478
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:49,680
[SPEAKER_02]: funds.

479
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a lot of money.

480
00:29:51,420 --> 00:29:52,361
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it so much?

481
00:29:52,581 --> 00:29:56,302
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess they're just... Does it come with, like, maps and books and crap?

482
00:29:56,662 --> 00:29:57,983
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.

483
00:29:58,003 --> 00:29:58,703
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

484
00:29:58,743 --> 00:29:59,203
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

485
00:30:01,101 --> 00:30:03,982
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes with your own soldier who stays in your house.

486
00:30:04,082 --> 00:30:11,804
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a teaser page www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp

487
00:30:22,898 --> 00:30:33,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobunaga's Ambition was a cool game though, that's why I had to bring it up, because I remember that game on Nintendo My Ambition, the great game that's so expensive I remember when we went through this thing of trying to sell that game on eBay Did it work?

488
00:30:33,086 --> 00:30:33,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find a buyer?

489
00:30:33,846 --> 00:30:47,076
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we got five bucks for it A couple more stories tonight Bungie has revealed that they will be doing nine brand new maps for Halo 2, but there's a catch

490
00:30:47,742 --> 00:30:51,052
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only going to be available for a fee on Xbox Live.

491
00:30:51,213 --> 00:30:52,476
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have Xbox Live,

492
00:30:53,140 --> 00:31:02,406
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what the hell you're doing with Halo 2 and not having Xbox Live, but if you don't have Xbox Live, you can get a separate $20 add-on DVD that will have all the maps for you.

493
00:31:03,146 --> 00:31:06,428
[SPEAKER_02]: The first maps will come out on Live late in April.

494
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:13,152
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to have two free maps, so you will get two of them for free, but then you're going to have to do two for purchase.

495
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:20,997
[SPEAKER_02]: But they are saying that all the maps will be free at some point on Live by the end of the summer, so I don't know what's going on with that.

496
00:31:21,677 --> 00:31:49,092
[SPEAKER_02]: but then there'll be five more well I think it's just those four but then there'll be five more on live when the DVD is released but you know there's people out there that play Halo 2 all the time and they will pay the money for these new maps even if they're going to be free in three months you know it absolutely but I don't get the point of the DVD because honestly how can you have Halo 2 and not have live unless well maybe you're the type that plays in the dorm with the local area but

497
00:31:49,631 --> 00:31:52,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, I mean, Halo 2 was made for live, so.

498
00:31:53,094 --> 00:31:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it has a decent single player mode, but what's the point of the new maps?

499
00:31:57,278 --> 00:31:59,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, one more story.

500
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:03,964
[SPEAKER_03]: So, did they mention that those new maps would have an actual ending for the game?

501
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:07,864
[SPEAKER_03]: No, nowhere in there.

502
00:32:07,884 --> 00:32:13,708
[SPEAKER_03]: The new quest will begin where you're searching for the end of the game, but unfortunately you will not find it and you'll be utterly disappointed.

503
00:32:13,928 --> 00:32:14,428
[SPEAKER_03]: But guess what?

504
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:22,874
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be another $20 patch later on where there maybe will be an ending, but we can't guarantee anything unless we figure out more money.

505
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,736
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll make you buy that Japanese game.

506
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:24,936
[SPEAKER_03]: It's $100.

507
00:32:26,837 --> 00:32:33,702
[SPEAKER_02]: This is probably related to that story we reported on a couple weeks ago about the Korean Xbox site announcing some type of expansion for Halo.

508
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably is the same thing.

509
00:32:35,941 --> 00:32:37,563
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that answers our questions there.

510
00:32:37,683 --> 00:32:39,244
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not, but probably.

511
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:41,306
[SPEAKER_02]: One last story.

512
00:32:42,647 --> 00:32:45,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Shadow the Hedgehog has a date.

513
00:32:46,691 --> 00:32:53,356
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be coming out this winter on the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2.

514
00:32:53,757 --> 00:32:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: Being developed by Sega Studios USA.

515
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,802
[SPEAKER_01]: That explains that VG Cats comic then.

516
00:33:01,123 --> 00:33:02,044
[SPEAKER_03]: And in other news...

517
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,226
[SPEAKER_03]: Halo 2 The Search for More Money

518
00:33:07,383 --> 00:33:09,364
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we don't know the rating or the pricing yet.

519
00:33:09,424 --> 00:33:13,785
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in Shadow of the Hedgehog, you will be able to control whether Shadow is a hero or a villain.

520
00:33:14,165 --> 00:33:15,865
[SPEAKER_02]: And it all depends on the paths you choose.

521
00:33:16,225 --> 00:33:20,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be shooting and racing through over 50 missions.

522
00:33:21,387 --> 00:33:23,527
[SPEAKER_02]: But can you marry the same sex in that game?

523
00:33:23,788 --> 00:33:24,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Shadow Fable.

524
00:33:25,488 --> 00:33:26,268
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell?

525
00:33:26,688 --> 00:33:28,549
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a comment way out of left field.

526
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:29,929
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like Fable.

527
00:33:30,009 --> 00:33:31,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Fable, you can marry the same sex in that game.

528
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:36,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, but Fable and Shadow of the Hedgehog have nothing in common except that Shadow will be on Xbox as well.

529
00:33:38,052 --> 00:33:39,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, shit, I don't know.

530
00:33:39,932 --> 00:33:45,234
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, there aren't that many female hedgehogs running around, so, I mean, you know, Shadow... Amy!

531
00:33:45,354 --> 00:33:50,755
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one, does she get, you know, four-wayed by, you know, all the other characters?

532
00:33:50,775 --> 00:33:52,216
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need a Knuckles solo game.

533
00:33:52,376 --> 00:33:55,897
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I think on that note, we definitely need to wrap things up.

534
00:33:56,237 --> 00:33:58,017
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, any parting words for our listeners?

535
00:33:58,317 --> 00:34:01,418
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, what's he gonna do for some lovin'?

536
00:34:02,694 --> 00:34:08,319
[SPEAKER_02]: My parting words are goodbye and keep your fingers crossed that I beat Minish Cap this week so I have something new to talk about.

537
00:34:09,179 --> 00:34:10,000
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, your final.

538
00:34:11,201 --> 00:34:12,822
