Hello everybody, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,800
our podcast which you've subscribed to where we talk about video games that

8
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,720
don't suck and well sadly some that do because they just sneak in there but I

9
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:40,720
think tonight we got a lot of games to talk about that don't suck my name is

10
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,880
Rob Roberts you might know me as sky I'll be helping you make your way

11
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:49,040
through this show joining me as always the lovely dark Sakura also known as

12
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:54,960
Jamie Summers. Hi! The perky Jamie Summers. I'm just faking it. Oh, okay.

13
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:03,440
Angstius always, huh? Always. All right. Also say hello to Loki. Hello. And how's

14
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,860
that DS charger you've been working on? You were working on it during the three

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,440
hour show. I'm on step six of 12. All right, for those who don't know, he's

16
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,880
building a DS charger out of Legos. Now explain how this works, Loki. Basically,

17
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,400
it's got the charging cord built into it and you just set the charger down or set

18
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,820
the DS down on the charger like a you know a dock and there you go and it

19
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:35,520
holds like no six games and three styluses huh and this is this is all

20
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,220
something you found on a website yeah I browse a lot forums god bless the

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:44,560
internet all right I like this idea of making your own cases out of Legos it's

22
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,440
brilliant concept. Alright let's get into what's going on in our own personal

23
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:55,320
gaming world this week. Of course the PSP launched this past week. I know somebody

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:58,320
in here has got to have had to put their hands on one at some point. I know it was

25
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,200
probably Dark Sakura, am I right?

26
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:09,360
Maybe. Your voice is cracking. What has been going on in your gaming world?

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,240
Silent Hill 3 lots of it not the PSP and no because somebody else has been

28
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:25,500
playing his new limb someone who will not be named Dan I'm sorry oh or not

29
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:34,540
named fiance or hetero life partner all right so you so you haven't really had a

30
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:39,000
chance to play the PSP at all I played it I played Darkstalkers what

31
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
What did you think of it?

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
It was Darkstalkers.

33
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
What do you think?

34
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
It was actually really cool.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
What do you think of the PSP?

36
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm really curious to your thoughts.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Surely you've watched it.

38
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,000
It's really awesome.

39
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:53,280
It has a, you know, the little LED HD screen thingy, and plays movies and MP3s and Screw

40
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,280
the iPod.

41
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,800
Hey, I still like my iPod.

42
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,960
Yeah, but, see, where you paid $400 for your iPod.

43
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
I paid $300.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:06,000
We paid $250 for the...

45
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
Whatever.

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Okay.

47
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
And we've got five games too.

48
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Ooh, and is Darkstalkers your favorite out of the five?

49
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
It's the only one I've played, but I really, really, really, really, really like Ridge Racer.

50
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
It's purdy, and it has Reiko in it, so it's all good.

51
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Cool. Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

52
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I played Final Fantasy XI for ten minutes.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You're cutting back, huh?

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I was doing other stuff.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have a Final Fantasy XI story tonight. It's pretty interesting.

56
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
We'll get to it in a minute.

57
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,360
But first, Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world, besides the DS charger?

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,520
I've been playing a ton of games, actually.

59
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,680
I bought God of War, which I've been playing a lot of that.

60
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,680
It's really awesome.

61
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:53,480
They're calling that the Ninja Gaiden of PS2.

62
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,480
What do you think?

63
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,320
No, it's very, very similar to Devil May Cry 3, actually.

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,320
Oh, okay.

65
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:05,480
Because there's a whole combo system in there, and it's pretty, it's just really good.

66
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,520
And they did everything right with this game, like graphics are amazing, the sound is amazing,

67
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,600
and just the sheer detail that's in this game, like you'll be running through Athens because

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,740
the whole game obviously is about like Greek mythology and that kind of stuff.

69
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:23,060
So you're running through Athens and you have Ares far in the background like destroying

70
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,840
these armies while you're fighting and stuff in the foreground and stuff.

71
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,640
And so it basically looks like Lord of the Rings, you know, where you have him he's just

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,960
like tossing armies in the air and just like stuff like that.

73
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,200
and there's fireballs and crap that he's throwing,

74
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,000
hitting buildings nearby you and stuff, and you're running.

75
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,880
There's another part where you have to go

76
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,920
to the Temple of Pandora, which is on the back of a Titan,

77
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:47,560
a giant monster-type thing.

78
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,920
And as you're climbing around the castle and stuff,

79
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,800
they'll show scenes and you can see the Titan walking

80
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,600
and everything, just tons of detail.

81
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:56,720
And correct me if I'm wrong,

82
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,920
but there's nudity in this game.

83
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,600
There is full-frontal nudity,

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,200
and there's a sex minigame. Awesome.

85
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,200
So you gotta love that.

86
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,880
And then it's violent and bloody as hell.

87
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,320
And it's really cool, they've got these like,

88
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:12,560
cinematic, like combos, little mini game type things.

89
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,640
And when you're going to kill like an enemy or whatever,

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:16,440
they'll have you do certain button presses,

91
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,880
and it basically does it very cinematically.

92
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,680
And your weapon of choice in this game

93
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:24,400
is like these two giant, like, knife, sword things

94
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,800
that are on chains, and it's just really pretty.

95
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,720
Wow, all right.

96
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,960
So definitely highly recommend, you know,

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,080
going out and getting that game is awesome. The other game I got was Time Splitter 3 because

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,100
I just love the Time Splitter series. I love how they have actually gotten really good

99
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:45,160
with it because the first game's story mode sucked, second game it was pretty good, third

100
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:50,760
game's story mode was pretty good actually. And they've got a lot of stuff that's been

101
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:58,320
added to it. Just a lot of like, you know, a lot of different elements into it. 150 playable

102
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,520
characters that you can unlock through the entire game, and like TimeSplitters, the other

103
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:07,180
games, they have a challenge mode where you play like these mini games that are really

104
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:11,840
off the wall, strange, anything from like, you know, survival like in a haunted house

105
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,480
thing to shooting off heads, breaking windows, driving a cat, and playing hoops, they're

106
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:22,080
driving a cat, driving a cat, it's a cat with wheels on it, I don't know, it's just driving

107
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:26,440
a cat, cat racing game, I don't get it, but that's what it is.

108
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:31,900
They've got, supposedly there's a thing that hints a Tony Hawk type game that's in there.

109
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:35,720
Just like it's so immersive and there's so many characters you can play.

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,280
Of course, one of the things that sets Time Slayers apart from other games is the ability

111
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,240
to make your own deathmatch maps.

112
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:45,920
Really good system that's only gotten better.

113
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:51,800
Online gameplay for the Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube, probably not, but online gameplay

114
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,060
for those.

115
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:58,500
so that'll be pretty interesting. And just like I said, the story mode's awesome. It's

116
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:03,160
very, very well done, like the graphics and everything. A lot of fun, actually.

117
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,160
Alright.

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,380
And then, of course, you know, the other two games I had, of course, were the ones I mentioned

119
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:13,500
last week. Gran Turismo 4, which I haven't really played much of, and then Dog's Life,

120
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:18,120
which I must say that this dog is wandering through a world of the most lazy people I

121
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:23,040
I've ever seen that want this dog to like perform miracles for them. I'm like god damn

122
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:27,440
it. This girl's like, I want you to build me a snowman. I'm like, it's a fucking dog.

123
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,640
It doesn't do snowmen. What the hell? So I threw poop at her.

124
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:37,600
Okay, as a dog would. So have you played any games you don't like lately? It seems like

125
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,920
you're really enjoying all these games. Um, no.

126
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:50,560
I really did like God of War and stuff, and I don't know, Gran Turismo is not really doing

127
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:54,700
it for me, because I don't really play much at Gran Turismo, I don't know, it's just...

128
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:56,180
But at least it's pretty if nothing else.

129
00:07:56,180 --> 00:08:00,580
It's pretty, but I think what the problem was is I remember once I bought it, you know,

130
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,940
and I've had it in the house for a while, for about a week, I'm just starting to think

131
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:08,460
like, you know, I didn't really play much of the first game when I bought it, I'm like,

132
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,140
ah crap, kinda wanted like a new Ridge Racer game or something like that, because that'd

133
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,460
be fun like burnout 3 or something you know I'm pretty cool but I still like it

134
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,140
you know I just have to get into it and play it some more and I'll you know love

135
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,900
it again sounds good in my gaming world not a whole lot new I've still been

136
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,340
playing Zelda minish cap and I'm almost done with it but that's pretty much been

137
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,540
taking a lot of my time however I did get to get my grubby little paws on the

138
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:41,840
PSP that Dan has for about about seven minutes or so I got to play either now

139
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:44,480
there's a little controversy over how this game is pronounced it's either

140
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,540
Lumines or Luminous and I guess Luminous is probably the more proper one but a

141
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,160
lot of you probably been calling this game Lumines. I gotta play this game for about

142
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,360
seven minutes loved every minute of it oh my gosh that game is hot I really

143
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,240
want a PSP not just for that game but it's just pretty and you can see movies

144
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,520
on it and stuff not that the movies on the PSP were kinds of things I'd really

145
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,640
want to see anyway but I just think it's so neat that there's all this stuff you

146
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,720
can do that's you know in your pocket. Now don't get me wrong though I still love

147
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,120
my DS and I think the DS is going to get better in the next few months. So I

148
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,280
really don't see things as a DS versus PSP thing. I know a lot of people have

149
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,760
been saying it's one or the other. For me, I think both of them have a lot of

150
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,360
exciting things to promise over the next few months. We will see what happens. All

151
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:31,920
right, let's get into some gaming news going on. We'll start it off with the PSP

152
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
since, of course, there's a lot of stuff going on with the PSP. One of them being

153
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,720
the dead pixels going on with the PSPs. You've probably heard of this. Maybe what

154
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,400
this happened to one of your friends, but a lot of these PSPs apparently have dead pixels

155
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:52,760
or do they? Sony is responding to the reports going on right now. It's commonly referred

156
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:57,600
to as a defect, however Sony is saying that this is a problem that actually happens in

157
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:03,540
all LCD screens. Says Sony, a very small number of dark pixels or continuously lit pixels

158
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:09,180
is normal for LCD screens and is not a sign of malfunction.

159
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:15,060
Page 13 of the PSP manual says this, red, blue, or green spots or black spots may appear

160
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:17,580
in certain locations on the LCD screen.

161
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,720
The appearance of such spots is a normal occurrence associated with LCD screens and not a sign

162
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,820
of malfunction.

163
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:27,440
So what should you do if this is happening to you?

164
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,060
They're suggesting that you try this out for a week or two, but if it continues to bother

165
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:39,060
then you can use your one-year warranty that comes with a PSP.

166
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:42,060
All the details are on page 125 of the manual.

167
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,060
You know what's funny?

168
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,060
I swear I've got this game system called the DS that has two LCD screens

169
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:51,060
and guess what? It doesn't happen there.

170
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,060
Why does it happen on yours?

171
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,060
Okay, but you know what's weird is I have heard of it happening on the DS.

172
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Maybe it's not happening on yours.

173
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:57,060
But here's the thing though.

174
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:03,260
But it's not a common thing, because I have a LCD screen at work, I can tell you this

175
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:08,220
much, I've had it on for a long time, it doesn't have any dead pixels in it, my DS doesn't

176
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:12,380
have any dead pixels in it, my Game Boy Advance doesn't have any dead pixels in it, why does

177
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,820
your PSPs have a lot of dead pixels in it?

178
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:19,260
Because you're using chip parts, and that's why you're trying to cover it up saying, oh

179
00:11:19,260 --> 00:11:21,340
it's completely normal!

180
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:22,340
Completely normal!

181
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:29,060
It's somewhat higher quality than what you might find on your conventional PC monitor.

182
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:34,120
It happens with HDTVs all the time.

183
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:40,740
So the advice I heard, and we were talking about this on the 3 hour program, Dan the

184
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:43,420
man was here talking about the PSP.

185
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:47,180
Try putting in the movie that most of you guys got with your PSP.

186
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:51,620
Put in Spiderman and try watching it and see if that unfreezes the pixel.

187
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,980
different tricks like that try something doing something a little different maybe

188
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:58,520
it'll help so hopefully we saved you some headache there if you're one of

189
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:01,920
those folks that has the PSP of the dead pixel I hope when I get mine though I

190
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:07,460
never have this problem because that will make me sad speaking of the PSP

191
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:14,720
very interesting some folks are using wipeout pure to be browsing the internet

192
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,320
Loki I know you love reading about the hack stuff what's going on with this

193
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,960
They're using the Wipeout, I guess there's a function in the game where you can actually

194
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:26,460
view the website, and I don't think the website's up right now or something, and so people are

195
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:32,320
actually using it as a proxy or a way to bounce off of it to visit other websites such as

196
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:38,920
Slashdot and Hackaday, where I'm guessing this probably was featured in an article.

197
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,920
I actually found the link from Slashdot, but you know.

198
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,880
Well Slashdot steals from Hackaday all the time, because people that read Slashdot read

199
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,500
hackaday and yada yada yada very interesting not everything works though

200
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:56,420
some things don't work like you know JavaScript frames of course you know you

201
00:12:56,420 --> 00:13:00,260
can't expect all that kind of stuff to work but apparently you can actually use

202
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:04,340
Google because you can use the X button on the PSP and it brings up a little

203
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,540
keyboard so you can use that to type in things so very interesting there but

204
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:16,060
here's what you need to be doing on there I'm looking up internet yeah see

205
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:24,620
now that would be cool is if you can download stuff to the DS just oh my god

206
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,360
that would be hilarious PSP to get spyware that's what oh yeah I know how

207
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,020
how many days did it take him to install Linux on the PSP they don't know they've

208
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:36,940
done it yet oh my gosh it's a miracle hey it's only coming I mean it takes a

209
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:41,060
while you know like a couple days we'll see all right if you want more

210
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:45,940
information on how to use wipeout peers hidden web browser head on over to this

211
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:53,260
website it's www.fumanchu.com

212
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:59,900
slash pspdev and they'll have all the information there on that hopefully that

213
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:02,980
website doesn't get crashed hopefully it stays up there but it's probably gonna get

214
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:09,740
hit with a lot of folks um also going on in the PlayStation world now this is a

215
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:13,580
pretty big story but we don't have a lot of information at this time this is

216
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:18,500
actually another article that was on Slashdot, but they're saying that

217
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:24,340
according to Japan Today, the US District Court in Oakland, California has ordered

218
00:14:24,340 --> 00:14:29,900
Sony and its US unit to pay 90.7 million dollars in damages to

219
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:34,820
Immersion Corp for patent infringement over controllers used with PlayStation

220
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:39,100
game consoles. In the ruling, which was handed down Thursday, the federal court

221
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:42,780
also ordered Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment America to stop

222
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:47,340
selling the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles using DualShock

223
00:14:47,340 --> 00:14:52,680
controllers as well as more than 40 game software products. Very

224
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,360
interesting if this is actually coming to light. I mean there could be a stay. We

225
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,920
don't know this is all kind of developing right now so we don't know

226
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,800
this will certainly be something we hear about more this week but my first

227
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,640
thought is those PlayStation controllers have been around for like 10 years it's

228
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,000
it's just now coming to be a patent issue what's going on with that is that

229
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,760
really how slow our legal system is or what I guess but still what is going on

230
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,000
with that do you think this is gonna hold what do you think they're actually

231
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,240
gonna have to stop selling PlayStation's because somebody else said it's Sony no

232
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:36,360
but Loki any thoughts on this have you heard anything about this is the first

233
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:40,320
this is the first I've heard of it and it sounds pretty stupid actually it's

234
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:44,440
like why is it taking so long oh now we figured out we can make money by suing

235
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:48,880
them you know I've heard of you know other things like this before where

236
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,560
they've sued for different things you know that's been around forever you know

237
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:58,840
so and I guess it sounds like they've won already so they just need to work it

238
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:04,080
out working out there's always appeals they need to work it out I'd be kind of

239
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:09,600
curious to why they waited so long hmm to be honest we have some various online

240
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:14,080
multiplayer online news. We have three of them. I promised we would do a story

241
00:16:14,080 --> 00:16:17,840
about Final Fantasy 11. This is kind of interesting. This is only going to apply

242
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:21,520
to the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 11, but they're going to be doing a

243
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:25,160
campaign called the Welcome Back Campaign. It's going to be going on from

244
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:31,320
April 14th to July 13th, and if you are a retired Final Fantasy 11, sign up on the

245
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:35,400
game's official site and you can get your play online and Final Fantasy

246
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:40,220
registration codes reissued by Squeenix, meaning that you can return to the game

247
00:16:40,220 --> 00:16:45,660
with your old characters intact and you'll be able to play the game free for

248
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:50,940
30 days! So they're trying to sucker you back into the addicting world of Final

249
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:56,020
Fantasy 11. I know all you guys are currently in Final Fantasy 11 but let's

250
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,860
say they reinstated this type of similar thing in a game that you've maybe left

251
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:04,420
like Dark Sakura for you maybe Ragnarok or PSO is this something you jump on?

252
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:10,660
They've given free months and I hadn't ever re-registered.

253
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:12,660
Do you think that's the main reason why they do this?

254
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:17,460
Your character, on Ragnarok Online, if you were in the second beta, you'd keep your character forever.

255
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:17,960
Oh cool.

256
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:23,600
So I could go a year from now if I wanted to play RO again and my character would still be there at her same levels.

257
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:24,240
Oh cool.

258
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:30,440
So, um, do you think this is just something they're doing to sucker people back into it and get obsessed with Final Fantasy again?

259
00:17:30,440 --> 00:17:30,940
Yes.

260
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
You know, probably good business sense.

261
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,740
Lucky, what about you? What do you think of the idea?

262
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:35,340
Are you...

263
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,640
Cause you're somebody who's still paying for Final Fantasy XI.

264
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:41,340
Are you a little ticked off that somebody else is gonna get 30 free days just because they quit?

265
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,540
Whatever. Who cares?

266
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,140
I really don't.

267
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:47,140
I mean, so what? They get it for free.

268
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,340
You know what I mean? That's just like, you know, all those cable companies out there that...

269
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:53,440
You know, hey, you get the movie channels for free if you, you know, join us.

270
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,940
Then people are like, ah!

271
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,340
Why are they doing that?

272
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,840
So there's actually retarded people out there that will actually quit and come back.

273
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:04,680
they get the free movie channels, like, you're an idiot, but, whatever, you know, hey, try

274
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:08,120
to get them back because, you know, they've got competition now with World of Warcraft

275
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:12,080
and stuff, so, good luck, but I don't think it's gonna work.

276
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:19,440
Speaking of World of Warcraft, this week, World of Warcraft was patched to version 1.3.0,

277
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:25,760
and what they've added, like chat bubbles, brand new chat bubbles, quest trackers, and

278
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,520
a brand new dungeon, which is called Dire Maul.

279
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:32,980
Now I know that nobody here is that into World of Warcraft, but it's kind of neat.

280
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:37,040
I know it's a very insanely popular game, it is a game I still want to check out as

281
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:41,300
soon as I officially part from Final Fantasy XI because technically I'm still on it, but

282
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,300
not much longer.

283
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,940
I do want to check out at least World of Warcraft, give it a chance, but I know it's insanely

284
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:52,100
popular so I'm sure this download, which is going to be 62 megabytes of a chat, a lot

285
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:55,140
of folks are going to be really happy about this one.

286
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:59,580
They're saying that the chat bubbles are kind of like what you see in EverQuest 2, which

287
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,020
should be very interesting.

288
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,040
The new area, by the way, the new dungeon, it's kind of interesting because it seems

289
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:08,060
like whenever they put in new areas in a game, it's always for high levels.

290
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,780
Yeah, you're going to have to be level 56 to 60 if you want to get to this new area,

291
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,740
Dire Maul.

292
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:23,180
Also going on in other online RPGs, the Matrix Online finally started, so it just launched

293
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:24,180
this week.

294
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:28,380
talking on the last podcast about when the matrix online stopped its beta did

295
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:33,140
that pretty hilarious sign off now tell me look yeah I don't know how much

296
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:35,380
you've heard about this you've been following matrix online more than I have

297
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:38,660
is it true now I thought I was reading something where they've actually hired

298
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:44,140
people to be actors in the matrix online yep that is their job to play this game

299
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:49,740
and move the story yeah they're hired to play the main characters like Niobe

300
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:54,340
Morpheus, etcetera, etcetera, and they're hired to do that.

301
00:19:54,340 --> 00:19:58,400
Wow. They need to hire me. I know, seriously, I mean, this just makes me think, my gosh,

302
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,100
now kids everywhere will be able to tell their parents, see,

303
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:06,460
you can make a living playing video games. I mean,

304
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:11,140
wow. Well, also just ask any game tester, but still.

305
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:14,100
Still though, there's a difference between game testing and then actually

306
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:17,300
like immersing yourself in this world, I mean, really.

307
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:23,300
I could, I would love to do that, you know, but I don't think that after a while it would get kind of old.

308
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:28,300
Yeah, I wonder if they switch characters once in a while, liven it up, or how they do that. That's kind of weird.

309
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:33,300
I wonder if they're always on 24 hours a day or what they do. If they switch, I don't know.

310
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,300
It'd be cool just playing Neo.

311
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Well apparently they do have Neo running around in there somewhere.

312
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
I don't think so, he's dead.

313
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:44,300
Oh, I thought he was in there somewhere. They said that he's spotted.

314
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
That's just a myth.

315
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,580
well you know how could they not even dead or not I mean you know Freddy's

316
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,720
died how many times bring them back and they'll do a fucking trilogy again yeah

317
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:02,820
exactly so yeah now this last bit of MMORPG news I have isn't quite exactly

318
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:09,600
about the game itself but the ramifications that getting really into

319
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:15,600
an MMO can have. Sony Online Entertainment just sent some notice that

320
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:22,520
there has been a baby named after a character in EverQuest. Player Tabitha

321
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:29,400
Ayers gave birth to a baby girl on January 6 2005 and promptly named her

322
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:34,780
Furriona Valle Ayers. And these people right here should have their membership

323
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:41,260
canceled and they should be castrated in honor of EverQuest famous spokes-elf

324
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:50,260
very interesting named after an MMORPG character loser what do you think but I

325
00:21:50,260 --> 00:21:54,900
mean they named babies after rock stars and movie character and all those people

326
00:21:54,900 --> 00:22:02,780
should be castrated just as well there was someone that Dan knew that named

327
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:08,360
their kid Molina Molina I actually like the name Molina but I would if I were

328
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:11,840
to name my kid Molina I wouldn't name it because of moral combat that we're

329
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:19,520
naming our first our first kid Richter so is this necessarily worse than that

330
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:25,100
or no although every quest is really stupid but I think this kid's gonna get

331
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,600
teased this person should have named their kid after like a cool game instead

332
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,840
of like oh you know proving to the universe that they're an addict sorry I

333
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:40,000
might name like I always thought Strider was a good name for a guy but not

334
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:45,000
necessarily the same way really a name it's a job but you know it's also a name

335
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:50,480
I knew kids yeah if you change the spelling alter it a little bit so all

336
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,720
right anyway kind of an interesting story there that now kids are getting

337
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:59,960
named after MMOs but hey you know if they name kids after rock stars and

338
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:04,920
movies I guess that's just a logical progression. Alright for those you guys

339
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:09,220
out there we want to give you a way to better your life we're not just here to

341

342
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:23,280
lovely Dark Sakura giving you her advice column. Dark Sakura what did you pick to

343
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:28,000
discuss tonight with our listeners this is how to escape from a bad date who

344
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:34,400
this now this is necessary I this is good how do you do this okay you can

345
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:38,880
fake an emergency excuse yourself from the table tell your date that you are

346
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:42,800
going to the restroom to wash up take yourself in with you if you'd not have

347
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:46,720
one locate a restaurant fun that's out of your date sign a vision bring a

348
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:51,240
restaurant matchbook or a business card that has a restaurants phone number call

349
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,960
Call a friend or relative for help.

350
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,720
Tell them to call you, either on your cell phone or on the restaurant's phone, and pretend

351
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:57,720
there has been an emergency.

352
00:23:57,720 --> 00:24:00,480
Believable emergencies are personal crisis.

353
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:04,480
My friend just broke up with her husband, she's having a breakdown, I have to go.

354
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,480
Business crisis.

355
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,800
My boss just called, she's in Seattle for a major presentation and has lost all of her

356
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:09,800
files.

357
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,720
I have to email them to her immediately.

358
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:12,720
Health crisis.

359
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:16,840
My sister just called, our grandmother is alone and ill.

360
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,800
Leave quickly before your date can protest.

361
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:21,080
Apologize but refuse any attempt.

362
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:25,240
date makes to accompany you. If you leave swiftly without hesitation your date

363
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:29,360
won't have time to understand what's happening or to object and then you slip

364
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:35,520
away unnoticed. Number one, identify your escape route. Observe your surroundings.

365
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,560
Take note of the exits especially the back doors for the best way out or an

366
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:43,940
alternative. Two, plan to alter your appearance. Think about your most

367
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,240
distinctive features and figure out how to hide or disguise them. The person

368
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:50,080
you're trying to leave is going to see figure moving past away at a distance

369
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:56,040
Let me be focusing on that first impression if you are not familiar to him and are an interesting you will not get a second

370
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,080
look

371
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:02,160
Three excuse yourself from the table move to the restroom or any private area with a mirror to begin your transformation

372
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:08,000
Your day will probably wait two or three minutes before expecting you to return so act quickly before he begins looking for you

373
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:14,100
For add and remove clothing layering garments will change your body shape and even suggest a different gender

374
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:16,620
Along coat will obscure your body

375
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:20,740
so if you're a guy and you want to scare your date off come back to the table

376
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:25,660
wearing a dress hats are especially useful because they conceal your hair

377
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:30,540
or facial features eyeglasses whether added or removed work wonders the

378
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:35,060
shopping bag is hand is a handy prop and can be used to hold your belongings

379
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:40,060
five change your welcome posture if you walk quickly move slowly you stand up

380
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:45,820
straight hunch over six use or remove cosmetics blah blah blah seven change

381
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:50,980
your hairstyle or color. Rubber band, hairspray, water, or gooey substance will help.

382
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:55,540
8. Adopt a cover roll. A lady in the restaurant may have an apron and be carrying a tray.

383
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:59,220
If you can manage to procure these items, as you attract a pair of eyeglasses and alter

384
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:02,980
your hairline or hairstyle, you will become invisible by moving out of the restaurant.

385
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,640
And put on a fake mustache. Make your move. Do not look at your date. You can climb out

386
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:13,660
of a window. You can use things to break the window, such as a wastebasket, toilet plunger,

387
00:26:13,660 --> 00:26:18,260
handbag or briefcase. You can even use a paper towel dispenser. You have to hit it

388
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,140
in the center though. Or, if all else fails, get your date to leave. Say something

389
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:28,260
offensive. Behave inappropriately. Send your date on a fool's errand. Tell him

390
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:32,020
you want to go to a specific nightclub, but explain that it's very crowded and

391
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:38,700
so he cannot go in after you. But my advice in the end, don't go out with a

392
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:49,380
loser thank you huh also in gaming news this week for how to determine the

393
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:56,100
gender of your date I have to save that for a future advice column Soulcalibur

394
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,620
3 is coming out but it ain't coming out in the arcade and even though link was

395
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,260
so cool on the GameCube it ain't coming out on the GameCube it is a PlayStation

396
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:11,340
2 exclusive title Soulcalibur 3. Namco has announced it it'll come out later

397
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:17,660
this year. So far they've only announced three new characters and I'm gonna

398
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:20,740
totally butcher the pronunciations of his name so just deal with it.

399
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:28,380
Tira, Setsuka, and Zasamel. There's too many letters in that one. Two returning

400
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,540
characters will be coming back for sure as well. Mitsuruigi and Taki.

401
00:27:32,540 --> 00:27:38,280
Mitsurugi, Mitsurugi. Sorry, I didn't play a lot of Soulcalibur. I always played ivy. I like the easy to pronounce names

402
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:45,780
There was a neat making of file, but I didn't really get to watch because somebody else watching it

403
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,500
On I do believe this on game spot

404
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:55,400
Also what they're saying about Soulcalibur 3 is that you will be able to create your own character

405
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:59,180
So now it's going to be Barbie dress-up Soulcalibur. So that'll be fun. That is totally up my alley

406
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:08,260
But the Zamzahamuel uses a scythe.

407
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:09,260
That's cool.

408
00:28:09,260 --> 00:28:10,260
That was cool.

409
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:11,260
I did see the pictures.

410
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:14,300
One of those looks just like Lulu.

411
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:18,860
Tyra uses a giant chakram.

412
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:20,820
I think that's the one that looks just like Lulu.

413
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:22,500
No, it must be the other one.

414
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,380
There's one I swear that looks just like Lulu from Final Fantasy X.

415
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,380
Like when I saw the pictures.

416
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,860
They're going into some neat weaponry.

417
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:33,460
kind of neat. But it's kind of a bummer because I really thought Soul Calibur was best on

418
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:38,780
the GameCube and yes 95% of that was because Link was in it. So it's kind of a bummer that,

419
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:42,680
well actually. Actually the Xbox one was really good. Back it up a little bit. Soul Calibur

420
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:47,460
2 was really best in the arcade. So I'm really surprised that Soul Calibur 3 is not coming

421
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:54,700
to the arcade. I don't get that but whatever. I guess really good news for Soul Calibur

422
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:59,340
fans that have playstations well and also the arcade market is kind of in a

423
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,980
decline true it's just kind of sad though because there are some really

424
00:29:02,980 --> 00:29:05,980
like I thought the conquest idea was pretty neat and it kept people

425
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,020
entertained and having your character being built on there it's kind of I don't

426
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:16,340
know it's kind of too bad but there you have it going back to a really really

427
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:21,220
old series actually I think this one's been it's been like slowly coming and

428
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:24,820
going but I just remember this old game on Nintendo I don't know if you were

429
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:28,480
ever into these games but it all started off with a game called Nobunaga's

430
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:33,480
ambition the strategy yes you remember this game on Nintendo well they're

431
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:39,160
actually gonna put out a brand new one on the PC this summer now this news is

432
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:44,000
coming out of Japan which and the name when translated means Nobunaga's

433
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,560
ambition revolution it's gonna cost a hundred and seven dollars in u.s. funds

434
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:54,180
yeah that's a lot of money but is it so much I guess they're just come with like

435
00:29:54,180 --> 00:30:02,320
maps and books and crap I have no idea no idea it comes with your own soldier

436
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,700
but there is days in your house there's a teaser page planes at you www.game

437
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:17,060
city dot n e dot JP slash kakushin k k a k u sh in so if you want to check out

438
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,220
that would be Japanese for this game is too damn expensive

439
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:25,220
no one on his ambition was a cool game thus why I had to bring it up because I

440
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,420
remember that game on into my

441
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:30,260
mission we created so expensive I remember when we went to the singer

442
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,700
trying to sell that game on ebay

443
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:35,020
did it work did you find buyer I think we got five bucks for it

444
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:38,060
room I'll

445
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:43,460
couple more stories tonight bungee has revealed that they will be doing nine

446
00:30:43,460 --> 00:30:46,940
Brand new maps for Halo 2, but there's a catch

447
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:52,320
They're only going to be available for a fee on Xbox live if you don't have Xbox live

448
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,940
I don't know what the hell you're doing with Halo 2 and not having Xbox live

449
00:30:55,940 --> 00:31:02,360
But if you don't have Xbox live you can get a separate $20 add-on DVD that will have all the maps for you

450
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:06,360
The first maps will come out on live late in April

451
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:09,800
It's going to have two free maps, so you will get two of them for free

452
00:31:09,800 --> 00:31:14,960
but then you're gonna have to do two for purchase but they are saying that all

453
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:19,920
the maps will be free at some point on live by the end of the summer so I don't

454
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,960
know what's going on with that but then they'll be five more well I think it's

455
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,840
just those four but then there'll be five more on live with the DVDs release

456
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,640
but you know there's people out there that play Halo 2 all the time and they

457
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,440
will pay the money for these new maps even if they're going to be free in

458
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,980
three months you know it but I don't I don't get the point of the DVD because

459
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:45,520
honestly how can you have have halo 2 and not have live unless well maybe

460
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:49,940
maybe you're the type that plays in the dorm with the local area but really I

461
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:54,500
mean halo 2 was made is made for live so I mean it has a decent single-player

462
00:31:54,500 --> 00:32:00,260
mode but what's the point of the new maps anyway one more story so did they

463
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:06,100
mentioned that those new maps would have an actual ending for the game no no

464
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:09,340
we're in there but you're the though the new quest will begin where you're

465
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:12,420
searching for the end of the game but unfortunately you will not find it and

466
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:15,900
you'll be utterly disappointed but guess what there'll be another $20 patch later

467
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:19,940
on where there maybe it will be an ending but we can't guarantee anything

468
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:24,860
unless we figure out more money we'll make you buy that Japanese game it's

469
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:29,420
$100 this is nobody this is probably related to that story we reported on a

470
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:33,200
couple weeks ago about the Korean Xbox site announcing some type of expansion

471
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,580
for Halo probably is the same thing so I think that answers our questions there

472
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:47,300
maybe not but probably one last story shadow the hedgehog has a date and it's

473
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:53,260
going to be coming out this winter on the Xbox GameCube and the PlayStation 2

474
00:32:53,260 --> 00:33:01,300
being developed by Sega Studios USA that explains that VG cats comic then and in

475
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:08,580
other news halo 2 the search for more money of course we don't know the rating

476
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:11,820
of the pricing yet however in shadow the hedgehog you will be able to control

477
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,500
whether shadow is a hero or a villain and it all depends on the paths you

478
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:21,500
choose it's going to be you're shooting and racing through over 50 missions but

479
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:27,860
can you marry the same sex in that game shadow fable what the hell comment way

480
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:31,660
out of left field it's just like fable fable you can marry the same sex I know

481
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:34,820
fable and shadow the hedgehog have nothing in common except that shadow

482
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:41,860
will be on Xbox as well well shit no I mean there aren't that many female

483
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:48,340
hedgehogs running around so I mean shadow Amy well if one she does you you

484
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:53,060
know, foreweighed by all the other characters. We just need a knuckle solo game. Anyway,

485
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:57,400
I think on that note, we definitely need to wrap things up. Uh, Loki, any parting words

486
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:03,620
for our listeners? I mean, honestly, what's he gonna do for some lovin'? My parting words

487
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:07,540
are goodbye, and keep your fingers crossed that I beat MinishCap this week, so I have

488
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:14,700
something new to talk about. Uh, DarkSakura, your final? Piranha River suck. Thank you
