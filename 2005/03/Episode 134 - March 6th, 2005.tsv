761571	762051	Hi.
763833	764093	Hi.
764573	766635	And not coughing up lung cookies tonight.
767236	773417	No, I'm hungry, and the dishes just got washed, so I gotta cook more rice.
775918	779699	So maybe you might be baking cookies later for food, I don't know.
780719	781839	No, cooking rice.
781979	782879	Oh, okay, whatever.
782899	785660	Not cooking... I want cookies.
787220	790101	I'm sorry, cookies weren't on the agenda.
790461	790761	Damn.
792233	795154	Well, actually, no, I have Girl Scout cookies, so all is well.
795174	797315	Girl Scout cookies are fucking evil, okay?
797335	798235	Girl Scout cookies are not evil.
798255	799175	Girl Scouts are evil.
799575	801096	Girl Scouts are not evil.
801196	801796	They are, too.
801856	804997	They fucking harass me when I try to go shop for groceries.
805217	808178	We want your money for really shitty cookies.
808258	809978	Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
810258	812139	I'm just like, stay away, bitch.
812679	813399	I will hurt you.
813860	821482	I have an entire box of Samoas locked in my drawer at work, and they will be consumed on my next cheat day, the entire box.
824068	827912	I've already torn through about half a box today, so I'm quite proud of myself.
828873	829714	Okay, I can get you a cookie.
829734	832556	I've had few enough carbs so that I can afford a cookie.
833397	833818	A cookie.
833838	834238	A cookie.
835179	836841	Girl Scouts are not evil.
837141	839243	The parents of Girl Scouts are possibly evil.
839463	844388	I've got, well, I'd say approximately about four and a half pounds of gummy bears left.
846372	850116	That is a big ass bag of gummy bears.
850236	854600	One time I left them in my car and the whole thing melted, like the bottom half.
854620	858863	That was cool because it was like eating a gummy, like a giant gummy, I don't know.
858924	860125	It was a gummy Godzilla!
860385	863007	Like a gummy breast implant or something.
867872	870954	Wouldn't it be great if they actually made breast implants out of gummy material?
871675	872115	No.
872436	872636	No.
876131	882675	Although they would smell nice and fruity.
883436	887019	Let's finish up the intros here so we can get to a break here and then start the real show.
888160	890361	Also joining us, say hello to DDR Angel.
891522	891862	Hello.
893884	896406	I missed one week and I missed comments like that.
897426	899628	Be gummy implant free, DDR Angel, by the way.
899648	900489	Indeed.
900569	900949	Indeed.
902625	905027	You know what the greatest news though that I've heard all week?
905047	905907	Voltron got served.
934858	939606	All this and more when we come back from this break featuring some Beatmania songs.
939626	942371	We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio.

1258553	1260935	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
1261595	1264277	Tonight's going to be a very interesting show because...
1265009	1268551	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1282819	1284300	Stop what you're thinking, perverts.
1284340	1285321	It wasn't anything like that.
1285361	1287522	I was out of town last night, so I was staying at a friend's house.
1288263	1295668	And you know that weird feeling you have when you come back the next day and you weren't sleeping in your own bed the night before?
1295708	1296629	It's like you were traveling.
1296669	1300852	It's like having that travel thing just kind of exhaust you.
1300892	1302013	That's what I'm feeling today.
1302553	1305295	Travel's sick, I guess, but I'm not really sick.
1305335	1306056	I'm just sore.
1306716	1307997	Oh, man.
1308530	1310851	I went to work, I went to school, I went home, and that's about it.
1338618	1339398	I really didn't do shit.
1340119	1344041	Except Friday I started hacking up my lungs.
1345061	1349143	Saturday I went to this stupid Kaiser doctor who only saw me for 10 minutes.
1355247	1360829	And then hung out with Iguana Girl and Islander all day yesterday.
1364091	1366913	Watching wrestling DVDs and Fit TV.
1368217	1368497	All day.
1368557	1369838	There's a Fit TV channel now?
1369918	1370118	Yes.
1370218	1370818	Oh, that's kind of neat.
1371419	1373100	We're watching a show about the Navy SEALs training.
1373660	1373760	Oh.
1374920	1376801	I have no excuse to ever skip the gym again.
1377902	1378502	No excuse.
1379963	1380423	Why's that?
1381624	1383525	You've seen the shit they do during their hell week?
1384005	1384605	Oh my god.
1385866	1391449	I've heard stories, but you know, I've never... Being... Having to tread water for 15 minutes in your underwear.
1392389	1393810	In really cold water.
1393890	1394390	That's hot.
1395791	1397232	And then having to do sit-ups...
1398590	1399190	In cold water.
1400531	1402391	And then lifting logs.
1404632	1405372	And lifting boats.
1405932	1409033	What rolls downstairs, hops over in pairs, runs over your neighbors.
1409073	1410073	It was pretty vicious.
1410914	1412434	And then only getting two meals a day.
1413394	1414835	And then having it be MREs at that.
1415735	1417035	And having to get up early.
1418756	1422077	Going to bed around, what was it, 11?
1422797	1423837	Getting up before 30 in the morning.
1423857	1425198	Horrible.
1426098	1426438	Horrible.
1427612	1433216	The horrible part is eating the MREs.
1434878	1436459	They're not always yummy.
1437920	1438541	From what I hear.
1440862	1443945	So, anything else in your TV watching excitement adventures?
1445966	1446146	No.
1448008	1450390	I want someone to come to my house though and give me a Nautilus.
1451691	1452511	That was really cool.
1453532	1456014	Just came in and there's this show called House Calls.
1456634	1457275	I go in and
1458103	1458764	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1487652	1489574	My week had much less coughing.
1493617	1494618	What did I do this week?
1495658	1496199	Not much.
1496279	1497560	I played Lost Final Fantasy.
1497580	1499141	Of course.
1500702	1506947	I watched Robot Chicken again because it's hilarious.
1509209	1512051	I did not think the second week of Robot Chicken was nearly as funny as the first.
1512071	1512872	It wasn't as funny.
1513873	1523361	I gotta watch the third episode to kind of get a feel for whether that was just a bad episode or whether the first one was a really good episode.
1523421	1527544	Yeah, the first one was really, really good to hook us all in and now the rest of it's gonna suck.
1528285	1531748	It wasn't awful, but it wasn't hilarious.
1532328	1533029	It had its moments.
1533069	1536672	At least it's not like what was that American Dad where the first episode sucked.
1537373	1538694	Yeah, that's not looking good.
1539274	1541376	I'll take the new episode of The Family Guy and that's it.
1543122	1545163	So, yeah, I've basically been doing that.
1546084	1551046	I got the movie Appleseed, and I watched the whole thing for that, and that's really awesome.
1551846	1560250	And now at work, I'm sort of playing brand manager for Pioneer to try to get this.
1560730	1570634	I'm trying to get them to give me $1,000 to screen the movie at our theater at work, because that's how much it's going to cost for pizzas.
1572093	1572533	Hello?
1573114	1573935	Give me money.
1574475	1575816	Give me a thousand dollars.
1576137	1576597	Okay.
1578559	1581782	Yeah, I don't know if that's going to fly, but I'm trying to help them out.
1581922	1588828	If they're going to want to sell this movie and get people to come see the screening, they're going to have to have food.
1591095	1599580	And it's not cheap to feed 170 people For those that don't know what Appleseed is all about Because, gasp, not everyone watches anime What is Appleseed about?
1599640	1607844	Appleseed is a fully CG anime movie That's all motion captured So it's really cool looking And it's playing in the Bay Area
1610461	1615284	So I got to finally finish watching that today and it was really neat.
1615865	1621068	I've never actually watched the original anime so I couldn't really say how different it was.
1621789	1630915	Then yesterday we went, myself and my fiance Nelly went and looked for apartments because our lease is up here pretty soon.
1630935	1633496	We have about seven weeks left in this studio.
1633817	1635638	And we have one and we found it.
1635678	1638980	We're moving in on the 16th of April.
1639620	1639881	Oh wow.
1640541	1641843	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1656638	1657899	And then what else did I do?
1657919	1660822	Other than get the big bag of gummy bears.
1662983	1663704	Not too much.
1663744	1667287	I've been feeling really lazy recently.
1667447	1670349	My headaches have been coming back and I think that's because of allergies.
1671090	1674392	So I took some Dayquil both today and yesterday and now I'm feeling good.
1675253	1675693	But, um...
1677185	1677525	I don't know.
1677846	1679987	Oh, I actually played some games.
1680388	1686252	I played Alien vs. Predator on my MAME cabinet and played it all the way through on Sunday night.
1686773	1689595	So, I've actually used the MAME cabinet for something.
1691816	1694759	And... Yeah, that's pretty much it.
1696540	1698542	That reminds me, I did play something else.
1698782	1699262	What'd you play?
1699603	1701084	Lots and lots of Tekken 5.
1701144	1705147	The game is infuriatingly hard on easy mode.
1705592	1707553	It is pretty challenging on easy mode, even.
1707653	1709575	But the endings are hilarious.
1710776	1714638	And I suck at fighting games, so I've only beaten it with two characters so far.
1714658	1715038	I forgot.
1715098	1719381	I was going to bring over my memory card to give you the endings, but because I've got almost all of them.
1719481	1720902	That was the other thing I forgot.
1721703	1731129	I got registered for E3, and I'm also applying for a game sales position at our company, which I'll probably get because I know the most about games there.
1731209	1735172	But I'm sure they're going to try to fuck with me because, you know,
1735712	1736632	Just for some reason.
1738233	1741273	I don't trust this guy that's heading the department.
1741413	1749595	I mean, he's okay, but he's been known to, like, you know, fuck with people for, like, you know, ride your ass on stupid things.
1749695	1751815	So, I don't know.
1752055	1752416	We'll see.
1752436	1756396	I should get it, but they're going to probably try to pull that, oh, well, you don't have enough experience.
1756776	1758617	Bullshit, I've been at the company for five years.
1758657	1760097	How much fucking experience do I need?
1760257	1764138	Oh, but yet they'll hire someone out of the company, you know, instantly into the sales position.
1765031	1766191	Can't wait to hear about that drama.
1767111	1771632	Yeah, so if I don't get that, I'm going to fucking leave that place because there's no point.
1771752	1775533	My position where I'm at right now is going to be obsolete pretty soon.
1775673	1782214	So, you know, if they're not going to give me a games position, seeing as I'm the most qualified, the other people that are applying don't know shit about games.
1782254	1785795	They just have console systems at home, so that makes them gamers.
1786315	1790776	And so, you know, it's really retarded, but whatever, you know.
1791969	1793550	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1811562	1812603	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1827857	1829158	I don't know, Madden anything?
1829178	1834001	Exactly, I'm like, you know, basically I'm like, yeah, I know that.
1834081	1835842	Madden fucking sells itself, though.
1836042	1838084	Or anything Xbox, in your case.
1838164	1848811	But after he told me that, you know, it's kind of like he repeated it to reinforce it, and I'm like, yeah, I understand that there's games I'm not gonna like that I have to sell to someone.
1849251	1850352	That's not a problem.
1851072	1851793	You know, it's just...
1852473	1860819	It's like they think that, oh, I'm so narrow in my perspective on game sales or something, but whatever.
1861920	1864082	I'll probably get it, and if I do get it, it'll be decent money.
1865503	1870366	Not going to say good money, because there's no such thing as good money at this company, unless you're a manager.
1870727	1871327	But better money.
1871947	1872928	Better money, yes.
1873829	1874229	That's good.
1874930	1878632	I want to go back to Tekken 5 for a minute, because I haven't gotten any hilarious endings.
1878672	1879473	The endings I got...
1880279	1880959	I have a pet tree.
1880999	1882520	Oops, I dropped the castle.
1882540	1888404	But seriously, if fighting game storylines are spoilers to you, then fighting game storylines really aren't that much.
1900526	1906210	Like, if we were going to tell you that, like, in Final Fantasy VII, Aeris dies, then that might be... Oh my god!
1906611	1908012	I did not see that coming!
1908492	1909153	Oh my god!
1909213	1910093	Now that's a spoiler.
1910113	1911414	You just totally spoiled that game.
1911474	1911754	I did.
1911775	1914557	You have no idea how much I cheered, because I hated that bitch.
1916498	1917639	I have my game saved.
1918422	1921785	at the battle, the Jenova battle, right before she dies.
1922445	1924387	So that I can watch it any time I want to.
1924687	1927550	Because my party is so severely overpowered at that point.
1928491	1930312	And I can watch the bitch die over.
1930412	1931753	You should go home and watch it tonight.
1931813	1932574	Maybe you'll feel a little better.
1932634	1935176	And then Mario, the princess is in another castle.
1938259	1940100	She's always in another fucking castle.
1940401	1943583	You'd think he would ask for directions before rescuing the princess.
1943683	1945065	They have these things on...
1947193	1949854	On LickSang, I think I saw them, or Japan Video Games, one of them.
1950475	1956578	They have... Do you know how you get the little boxes that have a secret something in it of a theme?
1956798	1957078	Uh-huh.
1957118	1960320	They have... You've got bugs in your apartment.
1960800	1961120	We do.
1961981	1963181	Great, nothing wrong with this place.
1963221	1963982	Good thing we're leaving soon.
1964002	1967724	Well, I know the government's been watching us, but I wasn't sure about that.
1967844	1970565	But they have Mario scene ones now.
1971306	1973787	And one of them is our princesses in another castle.
1974687	1975528	And then there's like...
1976007	1980470	The Fireball one, and there's the Coin Box one, and all kinds of stuff.
1981671	1982512	Mario's a great game.
1983573	1984994	So what are the funny endings in Tekken 5?
1985254	1986475	Because I haven't gotten them yet.
1986815	1987976	I heard Lee was funny.
1988216	1990638	Kuma and Panda are just hilarious.
1991159	1997523	If you're playing as Panda, Kuma comes up and says, Take these flowers, be my wife.
1999965	2004849	I don't know if anyone's ever played Street Fighter Alpha 3, but Blanka's ending is with Dan.
2005327	2007908	and Blanka, growl, growl, growl, oh, it's my good friend Dan.
2008468	2010268	Well, that's what they do with Kuma and Panda.
2011388	2012369	And Roger Jr.
2013609	2015049	Yes, the kangaroo is back.
2016130	2017830	He was the first character I unlocked, yeah.
2017930	2019330	Deviljin is like, whoo.
2020411	2021591	His ending is really evil.
2021891	2025152	I want... My favorite ending is Asuka's ending.
2026192	2026592	Because...
2027611	2047312	Jin's laying on the ground, all unconscious, beaten up to death, and she tries to wake him up, and then he jumps up, suddenly awake, and falls on her, with his face in her boobs, and she punches him across the screen.
2048490	2050531	It would be funnier if it was all chibi-fied when they did it.
2050811	2053673	Because the movies in Tekken 5 are actually really well done.
2053693	2055914	They're really nice looking and the music's very nice.
2055954	2057095	I'm wrong, I just speak Korean.
2057815	2059136	Yeah.
2059316	2063178	And they didn't all speak English, they all speak native languages and subtitle.
2063578	2064579	So I thought that's pretty cool.
2065600	2067441	I did like the thing with Julia and Gunryu.
2068221	2070022	See, I'm a big Tekken fan.
2070602	2073344	And if ever you follow the story, Gunryu had a thing for her mom.
2074673	2076474	So, he's going, Julia Jones!
2077335	2079156	She's like, what are you talking about?
2081157	2082818	When they fight each other, yeah, it's pretty funny.
2083018	2083458	I like that.
2084239	2086640	I need to beat it with Anna, though, because Anna's my favorite.
2086680	2087401	She's so my favorite.
2087441	2090963	The Anna and Nina endings, beat it with Anna first, and then beat it with Nina.
2091623	2093744	Wasn't there, like, an old guy in that or something?
2093764	2096346	When you're fighting him, he's like, nice boobs, or something.
2096366	2098527	Yeah, there's an old guy that's... I don't remember.
2098547	2099208	Who's the old guy?
2099248	2099868	Wong Jin-Rae.
2100108	2101609	Wong Jin-Rae, and when you fight...
2102426	2104107	with, I think, Zayu.
2104627	2109270	Yeah, if you fight him with her, then he makes that comment.
2109830	2111431	Zayu's ending is, of course, animated.
2112611	2113992	Like it was in Tekken 3.
2114232	2114432	Right.
2115213	2116734	I have yet to go back and play Tekken 1, 2, 3.
2117934	2118574	Well, they're on there.
2119495	2121396	Too bad they don't have Gon in this one again.
2121656	2122016	I know.
2122036	2124798	Because it was all about playing Tekken 4 with Gon.
2126939	2127999	And, of course, the Gon ending.
2128340	2129860	Which is just like reading one of the manga.
2130140	2131021	The Gon manga is funny.
2132011	2134132	What was I going to say?
2134532	2135453	The minigame in it.
2136193	2139455	I know this isn't supposed to be the Tekken chat show, but you know what?
2139475	2139855	Deal with it.
2139975	2142917	The little Tekken RPG thing?
2142997	2144558	We called it Devil Jin May Cry.
2145378	2147540	I guess, kind of, except it's really repetitive.
2147580	2148580	That's the only thing I didn't like about it.
2148600	2149421	It's very repetitive.
2149801	2152082	Yeah, it's pretty cool.
2152202	2153623	For a minigame, it's very cool.
2154243	2156765	I give it my hats off, too.
2157725	2160747	But the other funny endings that I saw...
2162071	2162972	A lot of them were funny.
2162992	2164233	The Paul Phoenix one was funny.
2164793	2170637	He's in his dojo and there's a big sign on there that says, aliens come here to be beaten up or something.
2170997	2174560	Because he's saying that he's the strongest man in the universe and he can beat up aliens too.
2175360	2175981	So he's all...
2176434	2180256	Punching through a wall with an alien picture on it, like his old ending with Kuma on it.
2181137	2184058	And then you see the space station, you know, there's the space station level.
2184558	2193643	And then you see outside all these alien ships coming, and his voice playing over their loudspeakers.
2194424	2195164	I think I've seen that one.
2195624	2196325	That one was funny.
2196825	2198586	And then the one with Marshall Law.
2200009	2205351	where he just gets done paying off all of his debt and then Paul comes up with the bill for his bicycle.
2206291	2207772	Not his bicycle, his motorcycle.
2208752	2209292	That was funny.
2211013	2212033	I love Tekken so much.
2212614	2213374	Tekken's pretty cool.
2213634	2215615	I've always been the Namco fangirl.
2215995	2216675	I know, I know.
2217415	2224338	I'm hoping in the next Tekken, because you know there's going to be a Tekken 6, I'm hoping that the little prince from Katamari Damashii will cross over into it.
2225078	2225899	That would be great.
2225979	2226899	And roll everybody over.
2229540	2229840	Alright.
2233183	2236386	You know, there was somebody else though that I thought would be funny.
2237547	2240209	And I had it in my head a moment ago and I forgot.
2240990	2242391	Well, if you think of it, just say so.
2243092	2244593	Alright, meanwhile, we're going to move on to Angel.
2244733	2245434	Angel, how was your week?
2245454	2245774	How was your day?
2247968	2251610	Well, let's see.
2251730	2253611	School on Tuesday and Thursday.
2254892	2259774	And I had posted earlier in the week that I lost my PS2 memory card.
2259854	2262936	I couldn't find it and forgot to post that I did find it.
2263056	2264857	So, yay, I can play my games again.
2264897	2266838	Woohoo!
2269579	2271400	Nothing else, pretty much.
2271980	2273461	Except I had to reinstall PS2.
2274727	2276247	Operating Systems, yay!
2276608	2281849	No, just kidding, because now I have to reinstall Final Fantasy XI and take three hours of my life.
2282269	2289712	Not really, because I can do something else while that's installing and stuff, and I hate that update though, it's so long, yuck.
2292072	2293853	Other than that, all my other games are installed.
2294133	2297574	I was just, you know, this is the last one, so, yuck.
2299358	2300358	Other than that, not much.
2301879	2305180	Hoping to go to a certain convention here in a couple weeks.
2305361	2305761	We'll see.
2307682	2308362	That should be fun.
2308782	2309102	We'll see.
2310403	2313224	Like I said, other than that, nothing much.
2314464	2315445	I'm boring this week.
2317406	2317786	That's alright.
2317806	2320327	This show kind of has a downer vibe to it tonight.
2321247	2321747	Oh wait, yeah.
2321827	2325689	Well, actually, there's actually an uppity part of my week in which I forgot.
2326149	2327630	I started DJing again!
2328854	2329654	You want to give that a plug?
2329874	2332936	So you're DJing for our competing radio station?
2333316	2333696	FIRED!
2333996	2335096	No, it's cool.
2335276	2335797	Give us a plug.
2336037	2336437	Give it a plug.
2337397	2344400	www.rushiradio.com Tomorrow at 11 a.m.
2344880	2347241	to 1, I'll be on Pacific Time.
2347361	2350342	So if you guys want to tune in, whatever, I'll be there.
2352703	2353103	Very cool.
2353840	2354460	Alright, let's see.
2354500	2355341	My week and my day.
2356241	2367066	Like I said last night, I was not here at home because I went to my old college town, which is a couple hours north of here, Chico, California, for those who may have heard of it, because it's kind of a legendary party school.
2367086	2367966	That's where I went to college.
2368587	2371548	And we went out to like four different bars last night.
2371588	2373989	We just went, like, we went fucking bar hopping, okay?
2374169	2376030	We literally, like, just went from bar to bar.
2376490	2380392	And I remembered why people go to Chico to party, because up
2380859	2384304	A little glass of beer that would cost me like $4 at one of our bars here.
2385105	2388128	Like a glass of, what, a pint of Newcastle, okay?
2388669	2390752	Costs like $4 at a local bar here.
2390892	2392194	A buck fifty in Chico.
2392914	2393615	It's crazy.
2394396	2396259	So, very happy about that.
2397173	2406199	and just, you know, had good times with some friends out there and just, you know, danced and drank and stuff and had crammed like 13 people into a Motel 6 room.
2406239	2406700	Good times.
2407940	2411943	But then I slept... Well, some of us, instead of sleeping in Motel 6, we went to this one girl's house.
2412383	2414005	Met this awesome girl up in Chico.
2414065	2414725	She's awesome.
2415305	2416106	She's young.
2416286	2418167	She's just fun.
2418267	2419148	She's great to be around.
2419488	2422490	And she's got her own apartment and she had us all over there.
2423211	2423291	Um...
2423891	2424752	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2445356	2448018	Like, you know, the poles that hold it all together.
2448599	2451101	And I woke up this morning just so sore.
2451181	2451441	I don't know.
2451641	2453963	Like, I swear to God, I feel like the princess and the pea.
2454524	2460649	Like, you know how in the princess and the pea, the evil queen or something puts one pea under 20 mattresses?
2461029	2462971	And she wakes up, she's like, I'm so sore.
2463051	2464933	I feel something on my back all night long.
2465453	2465974	That's me.
2466594	2467855	I was the prince and the pole.
2468075	2469517	That was my story.
2469617	2470978	So that was no fun at all.
2472273	2475997	I want to tell an interesting story that I thought would be interesting.
2476017	2481902	I don't get into political issues very often, but I had to say this.
2483111	2488655	I was out at one of the bars yesterday, and we were at this place called Joe's, which is a little pub-type place.
2488715	2493799	It's kind of got a pub atmosphere, and they've got sawdust all over the floor, which I think is really funny, because it's like walking into a barn.
2494219	2495040	It kind of smells like a barn.
2495300	2498482	And my friend says that's to pick up the vomit really easy, which kind of makes sense, you know.
2499282	2499703	Sawdust.
2501664	2502905	I think that's hilarious.
2503345	2505547	So there's sawdust all over the ground, and...
2506232	2510514	We were walking through the bar to get to the outside area so we could all take a huge table outside.
2511094	2514215	And there was this guy who was wearing a frat shirt.
2514835	2517596	And it had the big Greek letters on it, right?
2517656	2518317	His frat shirt.
2518357	2521958	And then underneath it, it said, Against Gay Frats.
2524159	2527820	And I was just like, what's your problem?
2530501	2532542	What do you care if a gay frat starts up?
2533982	2537206	Are you afraid they're going to, you know, come attack you?
2537947	2545155	Are you afraid that the sorority girls might go to their parties because they'll have more fun and they won't get raped at those parties?
2545596	2546597	You're talking about gay people.
2546637	2549100	It's not like the Jehovah's Witness or something where they just like...
2550813	2552154	I've dated a gay frat house before.
2565791	2566272	It was fun.
2583208	2587130	Okay, are you worried there's going to be competition in sports or something?
2587190	2593793	Dude, this is just so, like, the 80s, you know, where it was the revenge of the nerds, now it's the revenge of the gays.
2594213	2599195	It's seriously, you know, jocks have always been against one, you know, minority of people.
2599615	2608839	You know, whether it be, you know, nerds, or, I don't know, gays, or like, you know, even going further back, blacks.
2609491	2611992	I mean, it's just, you know, that's what frats do.
2612092	2616675	It's like they get drunk, they're like, okay, now we have to be an activist at something.
2616915	2619156	We have to make ourselves feel better by making fun of somebody.
2619176	2629462	How about we impress a group of people so that we can feel more masculine and that way we can, you know, dignify ourselves for being stupid and not getting anywhere in life.
2630962	2631183	Yeah.
2632810	2635732	Another story, there was a fraternity up there in Chico.
2635752	2645276	You might have heard this in the news, but they made some guy, as part of a hazing ritual, swallow five gallons of water, and the guy fucking drowned from drinking so much water.
2645296	2647177	They forced him to drink all this water.
2647197	2648898	He fucking died from it, right?
2649338	2651139	That would never happen in a gay fraternity.
2651419	2653260	The only thing you get drowned in is love.
2657882	2658162	It's just...
2659577	2661138	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2689880	2696342	From what I understand, they're actually pretty similar to straight fraternities, just without all the bullshit.
2696743	2702805	But I think what was really funny is we all went back there and we just started bitching and we were talking about what an idiot the guy must be.
2702845	2706446	There's like 13 of us, girls and guys, straight, gay, everything.
2706506	2708106	Just an eclectic group of people, right?
2708507	2710367	Just sitting around like how stupid this guy was.
2710387	2715849	In fact, I called this one girl the ringleader of Algada because she was talking about how she wanted to go firebomb their house and stuff.
2716569	2716689	And
2720453	2729696	I think what happened is that the guy sitting at the table across from us was in that same fraternity because I saw the two of them talking later on in the evening and they looked at us weird when we left.
2730336	2731436	And I was just kind of like, eh, whatever.
2731737	2732337	That's what you get.
2734377	2735558	So anyway, that was my little rant.
2735998	2736538	You know what?
2737118	2738118	Hating is stupid.
2739639	2740699	I hate people that hate.
2741179	2741960	I hate them too.
2742600	2744500	I have no tolerance for intolerance.
2744961	2745921	Yeah, damn them.
2746901	2749162	We need to ostracize them from our society.
2749182	2749322	Ugh.
2751721	2753203	We should not allow them to get married.
2753723	2754083	Yeah.
2754664	2755424	They need to be neutered.
2756665	2758487	Because that just encourages reproduction.
2760508	2763090	I really do think that there needs to be a breeding test.
2765132	2769675	A standardized test for potential parents.
2770336	2772297	And if you fail, tied.
2773318	2779002	Which one of these would not make a good bed for your baby?
2779823	2779843	A.
2780543	2796455	Crib, B, Bassinet, C, Tupperware Container Seriously, have you ever seen the back of one of those Tupperware storage things?
2796495	2798637	Like the huge ones that you're supposed to put your clothes in?
2798937	2808625	You look at the back and it has the little do-nots I laugh because I've seen it Yes, and it has the little do-nots in the back And one of them has a do-not And it has a little picture of a baby in the Tupperware container
2809784	2813706	Who in the hell is stupid enough to... And you know they only put that on there because somebody did it.
2816048	2825893	If you're putting your baby in a Tupperware container, and even worse, maybe I can see somebody putting a baby in a Tupperware container just for a little bit so they don't get into things.
2826333	2827714	But putting the lid on it?
2828074	2829855	Dude, this is all the Japanese fault.
2829976	2831456	And I can tell you why.
2831697	2832457	I'm going to get into this.
2833107	2842216	I saw a video last night, now don't ask me why I'm browsing strange fetish videos for Japanese, whatever, it's on that SuperZooie because you got all the weird shit on there.
2842476	2858051	Anyways, they have a fetish thing where they actually vacuum seal people inside those storage bags, women, and they just leave them there, like, as they suck all the air out, and I'm like, that's weird.
2858959	2860259	But it's people like that.
2860920	2862220	That's why they have to put these things on here.
2862380	2863621	Don't vacuum seal your kids.
2864761	2865761	That will not keep them fresh.
2869383	2870663	I just... I don't know.
2871804	2873084	I weep for the future.
2873704	2874364	I really do.
2876365	2878066	Anyway, what else did I do this week?
2878366	2880947	I've been taking a hiatus from Final Fantasy XI this week.
2881027	2882927	I'm on vacation from Vanadil.
2883448	2885468	So I've been playing other games, like Final Fantasy II.
2886409	2887329	I've been going back and playing that
2888409	2891430	Well, I'm actually doing pretty well at Final Fantasy 2, and it's actually a pretty neat game.
2891450	2892350	It's all about Final Fantasy 3.
2893590	2895991	Which is the one game they need to release here, dammit.
2896211	2897591	And they're supposed to do it on the DS later.
2897611	2899192	Final Fantasy 3 was the job change game.
2899832	2901292	Yeah, that was the first job change.
2901372	2902533	And it was pretty cool.
2903013	2906554	However, I did not realize that Chocobos actually first appeared in Final Fantasy 2.
2907074	2908454	I thought they did not make an appearance until 3.
2908674	2909974	I thought it was 2.
2910374	2913975	And by the way, we're talking Japanese numbers here, not the Americanized 2 and 3.
2914195	2916356	I still think Final Fantasy 5 was the best of all of them.
2918688	2920549	It's okay, my favorite is still four.
2920850	2922191	Because it's all about butts.
2923472	2923852	Sorry.
2926414	2935682	I love how some names are... In Japanese, it would be like Batsu, like that.
2937384	2940687	But if you try to Romanize it, it would be butt...
2942566	2948929	And the copy that I had that was translated, I had it done... Because I first tried to play it in Japanese, and I got decently through it.
2949449	2958753	The second one I had that was a translated ROM... Yeah, there was that huge... Like, it was... This was... Because Final Fantasy V was like the first fully translated Japanese ROM that hit the internet.
2958773	2959553	It was huge.
2959673	2960394	I even played that.
2960434	2961014	I remember that.
2961074	2968117	That's when I first really played Final Fantasy V. And I understood why they didn't release it in the United States, because it was too complicated...
2968942	2970463	for the audience at the time, I think.
2970483	2971544	The first dumb Americans.
2972125	2972545	Basically.
2972565	2975087	I mean, it was a step up, but now, oh, no big deal now.
2975668	2986898	But I also, actually, the big ROM to me, the one that caused the biggest stir, was when they did Seiken Densetsu 3, which was the one after Secret of Mana over here.
2986918	2988239	That was huge, too.
2988419	2992222	Because the first Seiken Densetsu was brought in the US as a Final Fantasy adventure.
2992362	2992583	Right.
2993383	2994144	But that was,
2994577	2997639	And they had gone so far as to translate the graphics.
2998700	2999981	Like street signs and things.
3000281	3000702	That's cool.
3001722	3002783	You know what though, I've got to be honest.
3002803	3005345	Second Dentist 2 and 3 is one that I didn't really get into.
3006086	3010389	I was probably more into, sad enough, I was more into Secret of Evermore.
3010869	3012130	Probably that I was into that.
3012470	3015212	I was just happy to find a ROM of Panorama Cotton.
3016333	3020156	Which, for anyone who is a big video game nerd like me,
3020737	3023298	Panorama Cotton, they only made like 600 copies of.
3024158	3026019	And I actually have a friend who owns one.
3027120	3035063	And I have actually the one after that on Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton.
3035423	3039565	The normal Cotton games are about the little witch that throws up whenever she eats this one candy.
3040185	3041505	The wheel-o candy.
3042266	3043846	And they're normally a side-scrolling game.
3043926	3050429	It came out on Neo Geo Pocket, it came out on Super Nintendo back when, PC Engine, which I have the one on PC Engine Duo.
3052401	3058082	But this one was a behind-the-character one, sort of a third-person perspective.
3059122	3060743	And you were flying the whole time.
3060863	3061483	It was pretty cool.
3061723	3066864	But this was all done sort of... I know Mode 7 was the Super Nintendo thing, but it reminded me a lot of that.
3066904	3067444	Heck yeah.
3067844	3069164	But it was really awesome.
3069904	3073065	And they made like 600 copies of it, and someone finally did a ROM of it.
3076266	3077946	Any notes?
3079557	3083838	I think one of these days I'm going to bring over the Dreamcast and Rainbow Cotton.
3086659	3087499	I want to see this.
3087739	3094381	And, you know, you've kind of been doing that lately where you're bringing over games and just kind of making us look at them.
3094662	3096282	I could bring over Super Producers.
3096342	3106005	It's basically like the precursor to the American Idol video games where you could pick out your little idol, dress her up, and teach her how to dance, although I need an FAQ.
3108323	3112486	No, I have the Marky Mark one.
3113166	3117689	It's either the Marky Mark one I have or the Criss Cross one.
3117709	3118990	I think I have the Criss Cross one, actually.
3122853	3126315	And I have the CD plus G disc that has the Information Society songs on it.
3127076	3131199	Our chatroom is complaining that we are depressing them tonight with our subdued chat tonight.
3133627	3136008	I apologize we can't be peppy every night.
3136088	3139931	Well, if I tried to be more energetic, I would cough a little cookie all over the microphone.
3140011	3140871	It would be disgusting.
3141191	3141472	Yes.
3142072	3142972	Microphones are not cheap.
3143813	3145134	Bring me food.
3145614	3146094	That's right.
3147495	3148336	I need a hot burrito.
3149796	3150117	All right.
3150757	3156280	That's crisscross with a K, not a C. I miss the bush.
3156960	3160643	Jamie may be sick, but she's not too sick to correct you if you get some...
3163356	3164897	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3187011	3187952	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3213140	3215742	Some Thomas Howard Lichtenstein as well.
3215762	3216822	We've got to get him in there as well.
3217203	3221185	So Guitar Freak Strumania V started off with a little bit of poo.
3221205	3222086	We'll be back after this.
3255956	3265782	I'll spin back and turn my mouth with a big smile Please don't shatter me, kill, kill me, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
3285095	3287096	and the rest of the band.

3616659	3617700	Thank you for watching!
3664752	3667954	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
3668274	3670295	No!
3670515	3671175	Just kidding.
3671595	3674257	Orange Lounge Radio, Crap Free Bavani Radio.
3676601	3679882	With the exception of that last segment there, according to some of our listeners.
3680283	3680903	Bitches!
3683324	3685885	They don't like hearing about our weeks or days anymore, I don't think.
3686165	3687045	Well, screw them.
3687906	3689306	You know, we listen to their weeks.
3689546	3690627	No, actually, we don't do that.
3692368	3693188	But we would.
3693288	3694929	We read a lot of their live journals.
3695609	3699290	We read whatever they post in the Orange Lounge community, although not a lot of people post there.
3699310	3700671	But when they do, we read it.
3702420	3708443	You know that starting this week, we actually have the Rice Princess, who you might know from outside the box.
3708864	3712726	She has started the 1UP.com Orange Lounge Radio Club.
3713866	3715367	Does that mean I have to sign up for that thing?
3715847	3716327	If you want.
3716387	3721150	I mean, you don't have to, but it's another... Ever since the... I've been kind of scared of those other sites now.
3721470	3722090	Yeah.
3722210	3723151	1UP.com is kind of cool.
3723951	3725292	I like what they're doing.
3725372	3725472	It's...
3726812	3727392	It's different.
3727872	3730793	As far as the gaming sites go, I like it.
3731113	3731974	I give it a thumbs up.
3732714	3749199	There are some things I think would make it better, but considering that the blogging aspects and the community aspect was not really what the site was built around, it was supposed to be like a game spot style site, basically to compliment the magazines that Ziff Davis puts out, Electronic Gaming Monthly and stuff.
3750839	3755841	Considering that that stuff was kind of more of an afterthought or a secondary, it's not that bad.
3756281	3758142	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
3784398	3785358	and some other little things.
3785378	3798584	So the cool thing about the 1UP Club that none of the other stuff we have really offers is that, you know, since Rice Princess works with us quite a bit, she has a lot of pictures from the inside, quote-unquote, and like old logos and marketing things and things like that.
3798664	3801825	So she's adding a lot of that to the community.
3801845	3802365	So check it out.
3802645	3806146	It's orangeloungeradio-club.1up.com.
3806527	3808687	But we'll put that link in the chat room for those of you guys who might have missed it.
3809768	3810028	Anyway.
3810666	3811066	RedOctane
3829918	3835943	and say that they were going to be writing a game, although some people kind of jumped to that conclusion, but they said they were going to start publishing games for PlayStation 2.
3836624	3837565	And what did we say?
3837645	3842349	We said, gee, it would be a great outlet for In the Groove, wouldn't it?
3842629	3845972	Wouldn't surprise me at all to see In the Groove be the game that's published by these guys.
3846573	3847994	Sure enough, not even...
3848846	3852247	Two hours after the show's over, it leaks to the internet.
3852287	3867029	Some no-name fitness gaming site posts this article that confirms that Red Octane donated copies of In the Groove for PlayStation 2 to this local school for their fitness program, and it was just a wildfire from there.
3867269	3870030	DDR Freak picked it up, we picked it up, it ran everywhere.
3870070	3876351	So now everybody knows, and Red Octane finally made the official announcement, the game they are publishing is in fact In the Groove.
3878467	3880009	If you can see me, roll my eyes.
3881972	3882853	But I don't get on the webcam.
3885237	3886879	It's interesting news, nonetheless.
3886899	3888481	I'll go cough up a lung cookie in its honor.
3889582	3890783	It's interesting news nonetheless.
3890843	3904818	No, actually, what's interesting, and I didn't get to this in How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because I knew I would want to come back and talk about this later, but I actually decided, because we have an In The Groove machine here in Sacramento now, where Orange Launch Radio is based, I decided I was going to go play it this week.
3904878	3905278	So I did.
3905318	3908702	I went Wednesday night, I had the arcade all to myself, so it was awesome.
3909062	3910183	And I played in the groove again.
3910643	3915365	And I still, you know, to give it a fair chance, I wanted to see, do I warm up to it a little more?
3915445	3918046	Do I maybe go, what was I thinking the first time?
3918586	3919687	I still feel the same way.
3919947	3920947	My opinion hasn't changed.
3921387	3922748	I don't dislike in the groove.
3922988	3926430	So please don't talk about how much Sky on Earth is ready to do dogs in the groove.
3926450	3927690	Because I don't dislike the game.
3928791	3933332	But I don't think it's God's greatest gift to dance games either.
3933352	3933873	It's good.
3934813	3936014	For me to poop on.
3938922	3939842	For me, it's middle ground.
3939863	3942004	There's things I like about it, there's things I don't like about it.
3942424	3945806	To recap, what I don't like about it, it's fugly.
3946226	3947827	I don't like the game because it's fugly.
3948587	3952929	I don't care for the interface, I don't care for the way the game looks in-game, I don't like the way the arrows scroll.
3952989	3956031	Yes, I know you can change it, but even when you change it, it's still fugly.
3956071	3959332	I don't like the way the arrows look, I don't like the way the backgrounds look, I don't like the look.
3959833	3961434	So sorry, but I think it's fugly.
3962014	3967997	And a lot of the things that draw people to DDR is the fact that it's chibi and it's cute and it flashes and it's seizure-ific.
3969352	3970713	In The Groove is missing that completely.
3971953	3974814	What I like about In The Groove, I like the minds.
3975074	3977655	They make a lot of the songs pretty cool.
3978496	3982437	I like, for the most part, I can't say the step charts are bad.
3982858	3985719	I think they're different, they're neat, they're fun.
3986399	3991061	They're not very freestyle-able on the easier levels, but they're, you know, I guess fun on the hard levels.
3991479	3993420	But then we get back into what I don't like about it.
3993460	4005107	What I don't like about it is that it's just, you know, an orgy of all these uber difficult songs that are for a very select, elite few DDR players to be playing.
4005968	4007969	And I just, I don't know, I don't...
4010891	4019576	I think it would have difficulty getting into the masses when this is kind of its big thing is that, hey, it's a game that's harder than DDR.
4019796	4028681	But of course, they're going back and fixing some of this because when they announced that they're doing this on the PS2, they announced they're going to do an all novice level and that, you know, their sequels are going to have novice levels.
4028701	4029962	So fine, they're changing some of that.
4030002	4031683	But regardless, it's not there now.
4033055	4035897	So anyway, you know, just kind of long story short, things I like, things I don't like.
4035957	4038399	And the song list, I'm very meh on.
4038459	4041401	Like, there's some songs I really, really, really like, really, really like.
4041742	4044364	There's some songs that are just very, they're filler.
4044384	4045785	They're absolute filler songs.
4047106	4048787	So, that's my take on In The Groove.
4049267	4053130	So when I kind of heard this was coming out for PlayStation 2, I kind of felt very the same way.
4053170	4054111	I felt very borderline.
4054171	4056553	I was just kind of like, well, you know, I'm not surprised.
4056593	4060736	But at the same time, what's very interesting about this is that
4062034	4064215	Now, they're invading Konami's turf.
4065156	4073201	Which I think is very interesting, because we all kind of know that Konami has basically turned its back on DDR and the arcades in the US.
4074342	4080365	There isn't supposed to be DDR and the arcades in the US, save one crappy mix that's five, six years old at this point.
4081166	4082226	I'm sorry, two crappy mixes.
4082426	4083547	I keep forgetting about 1.5.
4084127	4084728	1.5 in USA.
4085048	4088230	So save two crappy mixes that are god-awful years old now.
4090558	4091239	Isn't it the same interface?
4105942	4106262	How so?
4106342	4107163	As in the arcades?
4107563	4108104	For In the Groove?
4108384	4108584	Yes.
4109205	4116851	From what we're understanding, we have not heard much to the contrary yet, but it's going to be just a freaking port of the arcade version with additions.
4116951	4118973	Novice level, four new songs, things like that.
4119313	4121595	So it's going to be the arcade version of In the Groove and then some.
4122876	4123697	Kind of neat, I guess.
4126055	4127456	But now they're coming on to Konami's turf.
4127956	4133538	So of course there's that big talk out there, Oh, Konami's gonna sue them, they're gonna sue, and they're gonna make... It depends.
4133998	4135699	I just, I don't see it happening at this point.
4135719	4137339	I think if they were gonna sue, they would've done it by now.
4137479	4139860	I'm really thinking that there's something going on.
4139920	4143081	I mean, now, the Rockstar people and the Indie Group people have been saying this for a long time.
4143442	4145622	We've got our ass covered on this, don't worry.
4146383	4149324	But we've all been kind of sitting there going, well, they probably just have a loophole.
4149364	4154886	You know, it's kind of the assumption that, eh, they're probably sitting on some kind of loophole that, you know, they might get their shit called on eventually.
4155401	4156361	I just want my Pump It Up release.
4181064	4182905	It's going to be a crippled release as it is.
4183005	4184866	Better than getting the Korean import.
4185326	4185667	That's for sure.
4185687	4189208	We have to get the converter for the PC pad and all that crap.
4189849	4190369	Oh, man.
4196212	4198834	I'm kind of reading some of the feedback in the chat room.
4198854	4205057	If you have some feedback, www.orangelawntrader.com Click on chat and you can give us some feedback here in the chat room.
4206438	4207618	Just kind of looking here.
4208139	4208299	Um...
4210382	4217809	DarkTest Studio says, if Konami wants to compete with In The Groove and pump it up on home consoles, they're going to have to pull out all the stops.
4219310	4226216	Well, what I think is interesting about that is, my assumption was always Konami could pull out one big stop in the form of a lawsuit.
4227497	4230860	But, obviously, they're not sitting on a loophole.
4230880	4235784	There's something there that is, because if Konami was going to sue, it would have happened by now.
4237006	4251330	Granted, maybe something could happen in the next couple weeks, as Konami could be like this announcement of In The Groove coming out really lit the fire under their ass, so now the lawyers are out, but I just somehow highly doubt it at this point.
4251751	4255612	It's kind of like Konami's just writing it off, which kind of irritates me in a way.
4256152	4257872	I'm having a check on something, by the way.
4258132	4258573	Oh, okay.
4259973	4261794	Looking up intellectual property in business law.
4261814	4263174	All right.
4263820	4267703	Well, you know, we could argue this till we're blue in the face.
4268564	4270705	If there's grounds for a lawsuit or not.
4271446	4273107	But there's two key elements missing.
4273407	4276010	A, we don't know if Rockstar has any secret agreements.
4276070	4279973	For all we know, they're slipping Konami a percentage of the profits to do this.
4280573	4282955	That could very well be a possibility that we're just not aware of.
4285257	4287138	It's doubtful, but it's a possibility.
4287158	4288039	You have to admit it's a possibility.
4288059	4290080	Because Loki's in the kitchen there going, no, no, no.
4290621	4291902	It's doubtful, but it's a possibility.
4295760	4296760	Okay, here comes Loki.
4297560	4298981	Loki's got something he wants to say on this.
4304001	4305022	Come, here he comes.
4306022	4308322	Okay, here's what's actually going on here.
4308942	4321124	First off, the whole reason is Indigroove was basically set mania, of course, changed enough to where it wouldn't violate the copyrights that Konami had on dance games.
4321604	4325085	So, that would include the angle of the arrows coming up, the arrow...
4325495	4328736	Graphic Design, The Interface, etc.
4329696	4329976	Okay?
4330697	4339820	Now, hardware-wise, the thing that they were worried about as far as violating that, well, guess who has the rights to the hardware?
4340020	4340740	That'd be Andomero.
4340840	4343121	Guess who's making the hardware for Indigroup 2?
4343381	4343861	Andomero.
4343981	4345702	Yeah, but you're talking Indigroup 2.
4345822	4346962	I'm not talking about Indigroup 2 yet.
4346982	4347982	Well, I'm talking about Indigroup 1.
4348162	4348923	Okay?
4348963	4352904	Basically saying that the rights are all taken care of and that kind of stuff.
4353621	4382847	as far as being able to compute DDR sure, people will buy it it's not going to do well though it's going to fail, it's going to fall hard here's why 13 footers on an ignition pad it's not going to happen hand plants on an ignition pad, it's not going to happen you know, it's just that game was designed for the arcade and the fact that difficulty level is up there you're not going to be able to utilize that part of the game on home pads on ordinary home pads, it's crazy and
4384298	4390139	To even get into Groove 2 a little bit, 13-footer doubles, that's ridiculous.
4390199	4390859	It's just stupid.
4393500	4393960	Okay, go ahead.
4394040	4395220	Finish your thought, and then we'll get to Jamie.
4395480	4400241	But then again, you have Pump It Up, where you have hand plants and stuff on that.
4400821	4403642	So apparently someone likes it, and that's doing well enough.
4404002	4409223	And whether that's going to translate well enough into the home version, that's... I don't know.
4409503	4411603	But I personally...
4412761	4414381	Think hand plants and that kind of stuff.
4414721	4416462	That's not going to work well in home version.
4417582	4425924	You're just going to get another pretty much rip off of DDR because you're going to have the new diet version, which is in there.
4426924	4431945	It's basically all the modes DDR has thrown in there and renamed something different.
4432945	4433165	All right.
4433465	4436506	I have a response to this because I feel differently, but I want to let Jamie intervene.
4436846	4436986	Okay.
4438223	4441005	I found the information I was looking for for trademark law.
4441285	4444607	I'm just going to read this one paragraph because this will basically clear it up.
4445248	4455654	A trademark functions as a guarantee of the consistent level of certain characteristics such as quality so that the public when making a purchase will get the product which it asks for and wants to get.
4456514	4458735	So basically, it's trademark infringement.
4459456	4460456	I mean, purely.
4461157	4466600	Because In The Groove has basically everything...
4467105	4468207	That DDR is known for.
4469189	4477001	It'd be like me putting out this special glass that's supposed to stay cold forever.
4477642	4480787	And then having another company put out exactly the same glass, but blue.
4481548	4481809	You know.
4483045	4483746	What about this argument?
4483766	4488587	Because this is a classic argument that people say about this, and we have to pay this respect.
4489047	4502512	What's the difference between this being one dance game to another dance game than, say, Tekken was a 3D fighter and Virtua Fighter was a 3D fighter, and they were very similar in that aspect?
4503172	4504593	If you play them, they are completely different.
4504946	4506447	First different, yeah, different engine.
4506487	4512211	That's just like saying what's the difference between Street Fighter and, say, Guilty Gear.
4512712	4517395	But In the Groove is supposed to play just like DDR, basically, right?
4517415	4522999	Well, the thing that always weirded me out about In the Groove is that it was specifically made for DDR cabinets.
4523520	4525801	That always kind of sat weird with me.
4526202	4531706	Now, granted, I realize this is all changing with In the Groove, but again, In the Groove 2, we haven't gone there yet.
4532432	4533453	I'm still talking about End of Group 1.
4533713	4534774	And you know what's funny?
4535094	4535354	What?
4535835	4537816	And I have to laugh because it's coming.
4538637	4545322	You don't think that they're going to stop... You know, they're basically taking everything Konami has stopped supporting and they're supporting it further.
4546642	4547103	You watch...
4547697	4560343	and I guarantee you probably by the end of this year you're going to see 5 key versions of something like In The Groove that's going to be supporting for all those old Beatmania cabinets that no longer can get upgrades because Beatmania the final came out and that was it.
4560663	4562984	You're going to have a new 5 key game that's going to be coming out and
4563924	4567265	I don't know about Dance Maniacs, but Dance Maniacs could be another step too.
4567446	4568206	Interesting thought.
4568266	4568546	Jamie?
4568666	4570027	There's a little bit more on this one.
4572087	4575529	Basically, trademarks are considered property and protected as property.
4576289	4579890	Trademark infringement should be prevented as a type of unfair competition.
4580771	4584212	Further, trademark infringement violates the standards of commercial morality.
4584632	4589314	Additionally, trademarks require protection as they represent an investment in goodwill.
4589794	4592859	with the law behind protecting the interests of the trademark owners.
4593219	4596023	Infringers are prevented from free writing on the efforts of others.
4598026	4599128	That's what I wanted to point out.
4599188	4604476	I mean, again, this in the groove thing is basically writing on the coattails of Konami for DDR.
4605137	4606318	There's another one on here too.
4607299	4613045	Infringement of trademark falls below the minimum level of fair competition the government enforces in marketplace.
4613585	4616708	Infringement of trademarks is but an aspect of unfair competition.
4616748	4620692	Since unfair competition is a tort, trademark infringement is a tort as well.
4620732	4622514	And for people who don't know, tort is a wrong.
4623855	4625076	A lawbreak, basically.
4626017	4627459	Doing something you're not supposed to do.
4628314	4635159	But now, the thing is, despite whether the law may or may not be in Konami's favor, because again, there could be a secret agreement we don't know about.
4635780	4636240	Could be.
4639062	4648449	Even if there was some legal thing that says Konami's in the right with this or whatever, if Konami just doesn't do anything about it, we're talking until we're blue in the face here, right?
4649270	4651131	Well, it's up to Konami if they want to pursue it.
4651672	4653253	But regardless, you know...
4654272	4655753	Okay, here's my perspective though.
4655893	4658915	Loki says In The Groove doesn't think it's going to do well at home.
4659515	4660015	I disagree.
4660176	4664318	I think In The Groove stands to do very well in the home market, and there's one reason why.
4666599	4667500	Okay, I guess you're right.
4667520	4668460	There's a couple reasons why.
4668680	4673884	A, if the price is right, we don't know what the price is yet, but imagine if In The Groove goes for $20.
4675219	4676941	And sadly, people are fooled by cheap knockoffs.
4689989	4690370	Exactly.
4690430	4691691	But here's the other thing.
4691851	4696476	And that's the reason why the Mad Catz GameCube thing... Yeah, why are the Mad Catz products selling?
4696496	4698599	No, the Mad Catz GameCube game, that's why that failed.
4698639	4699880	Because the price was wrong on that.
4700120	4701382	And you had to have a special pad for it.
4701422	4702763	There was no way they were going to make that cheap.
4702783	4706507	Well, I'm talking about their dance pads and all the third-party pads that were so crappy.
4707468	4708630	You bring me to my other point, though.
4708970	4711433	Red Octane has a lock...
4712217	4713858	on the home market for dance pads.
4713999	4714599	They really do.
4715640	4720784	Most people that are into dance games know that Red Octane produces the best home pads.
4721224	4726909	And stores like GameStop, EB Games, Fry's, whatever, carry tons of the Red Octane pads.
4727549	4729290	Remember Fulton and Marconi.
4729891	4730131	Yes.
4732393	4732953	But remember this.
4733113	4735655	Red Octane is now the one that's going to be putting out in the groove.
4736676	4741560	So what's going to stop them from putting on every box of these dance pads, you know,
4742259	4745220	for use with games such as In The Groove.
4745920	4747861	Buy In The Groove in stores now.
4748361	4749381	In The Groove this, In The Groove that.
4749842	4756784	It's going to be this automatic partnership between the biggest selling dance pad and now this new game.
4756884	4764126	I think the only way we're going to get somewhat of a straight answer is start looking for a press release from Konami or start contacting their reps.
4766027	4766687	Ask the question.
4766967	4768428	Well, you remember we had the...
4769884	4778986	We had the lost interview with Jason Enos that we did at E3 last year and we didn't end up getting to play it on the station because things happened and it didn't end up getting saved.
4780307	4785648	But Loki actually dropped the bomb and he asked straight up, he said, what do you think of In the Groove?
4786908	4792550	And the answer we got was kind of, it was very politically correct middle ground kind of, you know,
4793097	4794858	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4823652	4824653	God, I wish we had that.
4824753	4827034	Oh, I'm so mad that that didn't end up happening.
4827994	4835018	Don't you find it a little funny that it being a couple months away from E3, we haven't heard anything about a new DDR game yet?
4837420	4842343	Because I firmly believe they are going to throw out the punches at E3.
4842903	4844464	I think E3, they will announce all of them.
4845684	4849367	I firmly believe there will be another one for Xbox and another one for PlayStation.
4849807	4851908	And I think they're going to do DDR Mario here in the U.S.
4853291	4880753	I think they're going to be rolling out new dance games on all three platforms and a certain website of a certain artist that we interviewed said that he might have an involvement with it but of course he can't say anything other than that interesting I didn't know about that I posted the link to the trademark infringement site in the chat room for anybody who is at all interested in knowing the legal background behind it very nice
4881888	4884191	See, you can educate yourself here on Renaissance Radio.
4884231	4887935	I still think that we need to buy Konami stocks so that we have a say in the company and stockholders.
4887955	4889256	I know, I know, we need to do that.
4891398	4895462	But it's interesting, but this is the interesting thing now that I see here.
4895542	4903330	I mean, this is kind of, and I'm sorry we're kind of talking about this until we're blue in the face, but, you know, we are a show about rhythm and music games, and this is it right here.
4904589	4905630	Thanks for watching!
4927199	4929441	This is just another one that sort of jumped off at me as I was trying to go to another site.
4948749	4952410	It was about the use of infringing marks in interstate commerce.
4952430	4957471	It says, any commercial activity that Congress can regulate is subject to the Lanham Act.
4958331	4970193	Lanham Act considers an infringing mark used in commerce when it is used or displayed in the sale or advertising of services and the services are rendered in commerce or the services are rendered in more than one state.
4970613	4974854	So they're basically trying to spread this.
4976095	4986243	You know, we've had... The arcade version's been in a very small area, but you start bringing out a home release, and that's going to be pretty much, you know, countrywide.
4989406	4991567	I have a feeling that Konami's going to do something about it.
4992668	4997732	I think it's going to affect their sales in such a way, they're going to see this as taking money out of their pocket.
4998033	5003617	I think E3's going to be hilarious this year, because all these dance games are going to be shown.
5004518	5004598	Um...
5005367	5006548	I'm so looking forward to it.
5006888	5009550	I think it's going to be a showdown, and I can't wait.
5010330	5012091	And we'll be podcasting.
5012251	5013532	You've got to get on our podcast.
5013572	5016654	We will be podcasting if I get to go, which I'm pretty sure I will.
5017374	5022638	We'll be podcasting every day from E3, and we will bring it to you as it happens, as the drama unfolds at E3.
5023098	5023558	You betcha.
5024999	5026260	I will have the laptop with me.
5026460	5026900	That's right.
5027120	5029322	We can update the site.
5029362	5030723	We'll have the orange box.
5032284	5032864	We'll have it all.
5034153	5037734	A lot of gaming sites will not be able to bring you the news as fast as we're going to be bringing it to you.
5038314	5038834	It's going to be awesome.
5038854	5040495	Yeah, just because we're awesome and we're cool.
5041075	5047076	We are dedicated to spreading the E3 drama throughout the world this year.
5047236	5048696	Other sites want to be us.
5052297	5052617	All right.
5053858	5062880	Now, Jamie, I would encourage you at some point this week or so, go down and give In The Groove a try.
5063060	5063640	See what you think.
5065482	5066943	Maybe when my lungs work again.
5067383	5069564	Yeah, I guess that would kind of slow me down too.
5070245	5081392	And when, you know, CCL is in the, you know, money-stealing sack of... I'm telling you, Wednesday night, nobody's there because everybody's at Roseville Golf Line because of the arcade mania.
5081952	5082973	I know, I know.
5083553	5084254	Angel, you had a comment?
5085555	5087156	I'd go if you guys want to go over there.
5087196	5090097	I mean, maybe like piling in the car and be like, okay.
5090538	5090938	Yeah.
5092694	5094715	Well, I'm probably going to go again this Wednesday, so we'll see.
5095375	5100676	The only reason I'm saying that is because I haven't seen it yet, and I just wanted to see it for myself, and, you know, why not?
5102017	5104478	Then you have another voice going, no, just kidding.
5105978	5111240	I just don't want people out there going, you know, oh, Sky doesn't know what the hell he's talking about because he's never played in the groove.
5111960	5114621	No, I've played it, so I think I speak.
5114941	5116141	And I don't hate in the groove.
5116761	5119342	I think they've got a lot of good ideas.
5120200	5144695	and I think there's a lot of good things about In the Groove so please, don't get me wrong I probably will buy In the Groove on PlayStation 2 because I I won't spend my money on it I have to disagree I probably will buy it depending on what happens with Konami depending on what happens there but if Konami continues to do nothing then I will buy In the Groove on PlayStation 2 I'm not going to give them my money
5146604	5150426	I really don't support poor rip-offs, so they don't get my money.
5151387	5152768	Well, let's have to agree to disagree there.
5153848	5155289	Alright, we're going to go to break.
5155329	5157710	When we come back, we're going to talk a little bit about... Oh, Loki, Loki?
5158251	5161032	I don't support poor rip-offs as well.
5161372	5168536	However, if anyone out there in the group game is willing to rip the hard drive... You don't support the legit copies either, okay?
5169197	5171798	Dude, I would rather HG load it and steal money from them.
5171818	5172499	That would be awesome.
5173239	5174940	And remember, kick an Ultra K machine.
5176252	5176612	Alright.
5181136	5186520	When we get back from this next break, I want to talk a little bit about In The Groove 2, because we've got news on that.
5187560	5197488	And then, I know, but DarkSakura, I realize you may have this kind of towards In The Groove right now, but let's face it, they're the only ones doing anything right now.
5202171	5204573	So we're going to talk a little bit about that when we come back.
5205618	5210079	And then I'm going to open up the Skype line because I know somebody out there is going to want to comment on this.
5210359	5211079	So we'll do that.
5211580	5213420	And then we're going to get into the Orange Lodge Radio Cage Match.
5213460	5216561	So more fun to be had when we come back from this break.
5217181	5221422	And Elmo had suggested we do a themed break of calendar songs.
5222402	5223663	So we're going to do some calendar songs.
5223683	5224623	And we'll be back after this.
5249285	5250108	Thank you for watching!
5280942	5282503	You've got to breathe your mind
5336157	5336805	Thanks for watching!
5446169	5447091	Thanks for watching!
5486434	5486616	Thank you.
5517086	5518044	Thanks for watching!
5549157	5550019	Thanks for watching!
5599797	5600744	Thanks for watching!
5633160	5636101	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
5636161	5641782	Of course, we've been talking about In the Groove, which is something that is really kind of
5662208	5663450	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5677785	5680666	So, I can see why people feel about this.
5680927	5685088	Real quick, I want to go around, take a poll, see how people stand on In The Groove.
5685108	5687269	I just kind of want to go around, see what people think of this.
5688530	5691331	Love the idea, hate the idea, undecided, or what you stand.
5691351	5692771	Just kind of like a quick couple sentences.
5692851	5696073	So, Jamie, you want to start?
5696193	5696893	Your thoughts on In The Groove?
5697013	5697513	Lung cookie.
5698194	5698694	Lung cookie.
5699154	5699394	Angel?
5700895	5703916	I have no idea since I haven't seen it yet, but maybe that'll change by Wednesday.
5703936	5704016	Okay.
5706721	5713183	I am still... The longer that they... How do I phrase this?
5714763	5727085	The fact that they are doing this, that they're putting this out on the home console, and the fact that the folks who make the game are out there in the community and being awfully persistent about all this, kind of actually raises my opinion of the whole thing a little bit.
5727686	5731066	It makes me feel like they really do want to try and do some good here.
5731386	5734447	I find the whole thing interesting.
5735163	5739166	The game itself, I'm still, you know, I think there's good things and bad things about it.
5740207	5741128	It's an okay game.
5741688	5744510	I welcome it, but I have concerns.
5745451	5748173	That's my long-sorted, blown-up answer.
5749073	5752616	Arcadian42, who joined us during the last break there.
5752656	5753697	Hi, friend, how are you?
5753717	5754698	I'm doing okay.
5755038	5757200	So, you walked into our big discussion on Indie Groove.
5757480	5757960	What do you think?
5759141	5759641	It's okay.
5759741	5764385	I haven't played it, so I can't really comment on the gameplay, but hey, if they're coming out with it...
5765513	5766194	That's fine by me.
5766314	5766955	Hey, why not?
5767315	5768516	So that's kind of Arcadian Sea.
5768536	5769137	Hey, why not?
5769597	5770217	Hey, why not?
5771078	5771499	Loki.
5771759	5772359	You want to buy it?
5773100	5773981	Loki says hate it.
5774021	5774862	He's yelling from the kitchen.
5774882	5775963	We hated it.
5777024	5777424	Hated it.
5778925	5779386	All right.
5780246	5781488	We're going to open up the Skype.
5781508	5781908	Just like that.
5782344	5786487	We're going to open up the Skype line for you guys, but we need to get to this bit first.
5786587	5791851	Because I know somebody will bring this up on the Skype line, so we want to mention this.
5793232	5797435	So that you guys kind of know everything before we just open up the Skype line.
5797475	5800557	Those of you guys that get most of your Bomani news here on this show.
5800617	5804560	Which actually, there are some people who pretty much get most of their Bomani news here on this show.
5805380	5807502	In the Groove 2 is happening.
5808621	5809161	It is happening.
5809181	5809922	It is coming out.
5810302	5814205	They showed it at the Amusement Showcase International 2005 show.
5814625	5816966	Here's the interesting thing about In the Groove 2.
5817146	5818887	Actually, there's several interesting things about In the Groove 2.
5819728	5821389	A, brand new cabinet.
5822069	5825371	So no longer will In the Groove be stowing away.
5826172	5826912	Not necessarily.
5827433	5829254	You'll be doing upgrades for regular cabinets too?
5829274	5829354	Yeah.
5829795	5830135	InTheGroove1.com
5857757	5865383	And then there's going to be some brand new songs in the groove too as well.
5865864	5871849	Which include Typical Tropical by Bambi from DDR Solo, which you first heard that.
5872409	5881076	Spaceman by Lin, who... Now that's the weird thing because Spaceman was actually a Bambi song, so we're not quite sure why the title changed there.
5881436	5882437	Perhaps it's a...
5885068	5885708	Well, maybe not.
5885748	5891251	It could be a cover or it could be an artist went solo or something.
5891291	5891691	Who knows?
5891871	5892291	I don't know.
5892371	5894732	But regardless, Spaceman's going to be in there.
5895413	5899274	And that's one of the songs that's in rotation on our station right now, actually.
5900555	5903236	And then, what was the one?
5903356	5908078	Sunshine by Triple J. You know this is Follow the Sun from DDR, third mix.
5909098	5913620	Now, of course, I'm blatantly mentioning the songs that seem to be crossing over from the games we already know.
5914040	5915240	There's a whole list.
5915260	5918541	There's already announced 50 new songs.
5918661	5921062	I didn't see a whole lot else that really caught my attention.
5921642	5930765	Little Kitty Mine, I thought that was interesting because that's by Nini, who did a lot of the Dance Mania songs, as well as Spacey Crazy Girl by Nini is going to be in it as well, and The Message.
5931405	5934366	Some new Ka songs, those of you guys that like him, he's kind of the Naoki.
5935366	5938307	Twilight, Tribal Style, some new songs there.
5940528	5941309	Very interesting.
5943290	5945151	So those are some new songs that are going to be in In The Groove 2.
5946011	5949013	In The Groove 2 has a very red interface.
5950674	5953555	People are noticing not a whole lot of huge changes.
5956037	5961940	But Novice Mode being one big change and just the cabinet and the new songs being another change as well.
5963260	5964101	Very interesting.
5966030	5987796	Okay, so, what we're going to do now, we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so if you want to talk to us, just head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us, and you can call in on the Skype line, because I know some folks have very deep-lying opinions on this, so I'm very curious to hear what some of our listeners have to say.
5988236	5989496	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
5990569	5990789	Hi.
5991229	5991770	Hi, who's this?
5992730	5994551	Hi, this is Sephiroth1215.
5994671	5995852	Hello, Sephiroth1215.
5996152	5997633	Now, this is your first time calling, isn't it?
5997753	5998534	Or first or second?
6000115	6001135	Yeah, this is my first time.
6001435	6002356	Hello, newbie.
6002856	6003456	Hi, newbie.
6003516	6003957	No, I'm kidding.
6004897	6006658	What are your thoughts on In The Groove?
6008279	6014123	I actually think it's not that bad, just because DDR is kind of going downhill now.
6015403	6016604	So you think DDR is going downhill?
6016624	6016664	No.
6017958	6020538	Yeah, but this might be bringing it back up, hopefully.
6021239	6024459	What about DDR do you think is going downhill?
6024759	6028780	Do you think that DDR Extreme on PlayStation was the wrong direction, or what?
6030100	6031120	Oh yeah, most definitely.
6031601	6033701	So you weren't a fan of the recent home releases?
6035341	6044703	Um, you know, I like, the song list wasn't bad, it's just all the bugs and the interface especially really sucked.
6046122	6063250	Now, you know, it's interesting because I kind of feel like, whereas DDR Extreme for PlayStation, this is just me personally, whereas I think DDR Extreme on PlayStation could have been a little bit better, I think there were some areas for improvement there, I think Ultramix 2 fucking swapped, just knocked the house down.
6063570	6065731	I thought it was a great DDR release, but...
6067425	6069507	You don't feel the same on Ultramix 2?
6069547	6072189	Yeah, actually I do.
6072269	6079816	It's just, it seems like Konami doesn't seem to really do much about Hawaii over there.
6080177	6086823	I mean, if they let them do, if they did the PS2 mixes even, it would be great.
6087644	6091868	Now, I understand that, because Ultramix 2 kind of feels like the sideshow at the circus, doesn't it?
6092842	6094583	Even though it deserves to be on the main stage.
6094824	6101148	It's like when you go to one of those big festivals like Lollapalooza or something and the best band you see all day is playing on the second stage.
6101508	6103770	That's kind of how Ultramix 2 is right now.
6104811	6106172	Yeah, I feel the same way.
6106212	6119642	I mean, Ultramix 2 is great and if they just pay more attention to it... Yeah, the first words out of my mouth after I played Ultramix 2 was Konami of Hawaii should be doing the next DDR release in the arcades.
6120700	6136475	and I still think that but I yeah exactly they should not that my opinion matters any or your opinion when it comes to you know the big picture over there whatever the suits are thinking at Konami but hey if it were up to me Hawaii would be working on a new arcade mix right now and we'd have tons of different drum songs in it
6137835	6150042	Yeah, I just feel that Hawaii kind of stays more to us fans instead of, you know, the PS2 mixes, which tries to bring along more newcomers with all these songs that everybody knows.
6150322	6150723	Absolutely.
6150763	6151423	I can see that, too.
6151463	6153924	You know, a lot of fans worked on Ultramix, too.
6153964	6157927	A really good friend of the show's, or a couple of them, were working on Ultramix, too.
6158067	6160068	So that was kind of neat that they got to be a part of that.
6160128	6160368	Yeah.
6161369	6161589	Yeah.
6162810	6164491	Okay, so back to In The Groove for a minute.
6164511	6166452	Have you actually gotten a chance to play In The Groove?
6166472	6170695	Or are you just kind of watching all this debate going on from the sidelines, just trying to keep an open mind?
6171836	6177419	I watched it, and after that I downloaded all the sim files for them and played them.
6178259	6179660	I mean, the songs aren't too bad.
6180140	6182582	I mean, some of the steps are kind of ridiculous, though.
6183923	6187084	Yeah, some of the expert stuff's a little ridiculous.
6187204	6188425	I can certainly agree with that.
6188785	6189766	But I've got to tell you, though,
6190330	6196218	Downloading it and playing it on StepMania and actually playing it inside an arcade machine, it's very different.
6196639	6200905	StepMania does not have the same feel in an arcade machine that it does on the home.
6201826	6204590	I don't know how to explain it, it's just kind of the way I see it, so...
6205987	6211071	Well, yeah, there is one in the area that hopefully I get to play someday soon, but... All right, well... Until then.
6211711	6213413	Until then, just kind of watching the debate.
6213433	6218937	So you just kind of think that in the groove, it's just something new, and so why not?
6219637	6220538	Is that kind of what I'm hearing?
6221318	6232387	At first, I kind of didn't care about it too much, but, I mean, Red Octane is putting it out there, and they've been pretty good with their pads and everything, so I'm sure...
6233137	6236620	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
6251034	6254175	Five Key Controllers and other sorts of knockoffs for various games too.
6254215	6255355	I think what you said is right on.
6255415	6260036	If In The Groove does well, we're going to start seeing a Five Key be made again.
6260196	6261556	They've already said they're going to do it.
6261996	6262916	It's not a surprise.
6262976	6264456	They've already said they were going to do it.
6266277	6266737	It'll come.
6267677	6268137	You watch.
6270877	6274678	If they could beat Konami to beat Mania in the US, they'll definitely own that.
6276238	6279439	It's just going to be interesting to see how long will Konami just sit and watch this happen.
6281363	6283304	Maybe they probably just don't care as much.
6283764	6284045	Maybe.
6284345	6285145	This is kind of sad.
6285185	6285506	I don't know.
6286506	6287947	I feel like I'm not important.
6287987	6289588	I feel like Konami doesn't love me.
6289988	6291489	Konami won't stand up for me.
6291849	6293670	Mom, I'm being picked on at school.
6293771	6296912	Why won't you say anything to the principal about it?
6297273	6298113	That's kind of how I feel.
6301675	6303056	Alright, any other thoughts on the group?
6305358	6305758	Not really.
6305818	6308339	I understand you probably have many more callers, so...
6309924	6310444	Not really.
6310464	6311705	We're not that popular of a show.
6311765	6312886	Not a lot of people listen to us.
6314006	6315807	We're going to let you go now, just in case.
6316547	6317688	We should open the line back up.
6319489	6320169	Thanks for your call.
6321010	6321670	Have a good one.
6322510	6322791	Later.
6324371	6325912	It's good to hear from new people once in a while.
6327393	6328554	It's good to hear from him.
6329034	6331135	Darn it, I hung up on the person who tried to call in next.
6331155	6331495	There he is.
6331915	6333156	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6334383	6335443	Hey, this is Al Mullet.
6335623	6337344	Hello, sorry for hanging up on you there.
6337364	6338604	You're the best name ever.
6338664	6342345	I was trying to hang up on my last caller, and I accidentally hung up on you instead.
6342985	6343806	Oh, no problems.
6344026	6344746	I get that a lot.
6344946	6345866	All right, what's on your mind, buddy?
6347227	6348527	Oh, you're talking about In the Groove.
6348587	6350187	I figured I'll talk about In the Groove.
6350288	6357910	I would love to hear your thoughts on In the Groove, because you made a great post on the DDR Freak thread about In the Groove, so I definitely want to hear it.
6358230	6359010	I want to hear your thoughts.
6359714	6363596	Basically, I can't hate in the groove because I haven't played in the groove.
6363636	6365476	There's no machine in Maryland and nothing.
6365596	6370258	I don't want to cross state lines in order to play a dancing game.
6370318	6370779	Hold on, though.
6370799	6382523	Before you talk about that you can't hate in the groove for that reason, I think there is still reason to hate in the groove, even if you haven't played it, because of the fact that it's kind of like it's invading DDR's turf.
6383424	6387445	It's like the Crips are coming into the Bloods' territory, and you're going to pull a knife on them.
6389122	6390243	Right, I'm going to get into that.
6390463	6391504	Alright, I'm sorry.
6392184	6392984	I'm sorry, Emily.
6393004	6393625	Go ahead and finish that.
6393745	6394225	That's okay.
6394245	6397187	The second half of the sentence is that I hate the fan base.
6397827	6399328	They are psychotic.
6402950	6410555	As soon as the announcement was made that it was coming to the home market, all I hear is, Oh my God, this is going to be the savior of the world.
6410795	6413097	If you don't like it, you're Satan.
6413137	6415438	You should be castrated and all this stuff.
6416859	6417899	I agree with you there.
6417980	6418560	In the groove...
6420087	6440193	I know some great people in the Indigroove fanbase, don't get me wrong, there's some really great people, but like a large chunk of the Indigroove fanbase, oh my god, oh my god, DDR is not dead, stop dancing on the grave of DDR, because DDR has no grave yet, they will have releases this year, I have utmost faith DDR will continue.
6441138	6443360	They sold a million copies last year alone.
6443380	6444641	Let's just pull the plug now.
6444701	6445261	Exactly.
6445281	6451226	You don't put out a press release like that and then pull the plug on it, although... We're so happy we made the money, but that's all we're going to make.
6451306	6452426	We're starting again.
6452927	6454528	It sometimes feels that way, doesn't it?
6454868	6455689	Sorry, I'm all... Go ahead.
6457630	6460793	Anyway, as far as In the Groove goes, I'm sure it's not a bad game.
6460933	6462914	I'm sure that I'll have fun with it.
6462954	6464575	I'm going to buy it.
6464596	6466837	I'll probably be the one who reviews it for Inside Pulse.
6467418	6470520	But I'm sure it's not going to be the ultra-savior of this
6471602	6473083	I love predictions.
6473123	6474943	I love predictions and making stuff up.
6474963	6475484	This is great.
6475644	6476504	Okay, what is it?
6476544	6476944	Absolutely.
6477424	6477845	I hear you there.
6497915	6498776	That goes without saying.
6499256	6499776	Absolutely.
6499816	6500457	It's got to happen.
6500717	6505680	Just like how Konami advertised the Dance Mania CDs, I think they'll be a very similar sort of advertisement.
6506101	6509343	And when you see the little figure dancing, it'll be on a red octane pad.
6509483	6509983	Absolutely.
6510163	6511124	I think you're absolutely right on that.
6511724	6512205	Exactly.
6512925	6514987	And it's going to be very interesting to see.
6515207	6516948	Hey, do you suck right now?
6517188	6518349	Buy an ignition pad.
6518429	6518609	Only $100.
6518769	6521351	And then you can pass that... Do you still suck?
6522031	6526735	Then you can pass that fucking insane 13-footer with all the fucking useless hand plants in it.
6526775	6527215	You know, it's just...
6528340	6529321	And do you still suck?
6529341	6531063	Do you want to pass our expert zones?
6531303	6532604	Buy our metal pad.
6532624	6536789	It's only $100 less than the best one on the market.
6539071	6539892	I can see that happening.
6541213	6542174	How about Indigroove2?
6542214	6543816	What are your thoughts on what you've seen on that so far?
6545109	6557719	I just caught the story a couple hours ago, and when I first saw that there was going to be a brand new cabinet made for it, the first thing I thought was very, very good move on RockSource's part for getting a new cabinet.
6557799	6565645	It will further differentiate themselves from Dance Dance Revolution, especially since they're not going to be solely piggybacking off their hardware.
6567398	6569539	I agree to an extent.
6569599	6576201	I don't think they're going to win over anybody who was anti-In the Groove because of the fact that it's invading DDR's turf.
6576221	6577862	I don't think they're going to win anybody over with that.
6578322	6584744	But I think they may win over some arcade owners, which is the important part, really, if you think about it.
6585524	6588585	Whoever they win over is negligible at this point.
6588625	6593207	I'm just saying that this way, In the Groove, looks more separate...
6593973	6605041	from DDR than currently because all in the group was beforehand was a simple upgrade kit for any and all DDR machines.
6606943	6609304	It was DDR ITG mix, really.
6609324	6609765	Exactly.
6612167	6613968	It's going to be very interesting this year.
6614268	6617591	I've said it as soon as Pump It Up received home release this year.
6617631	6620793	This is going to be the best year for dance games on the whole.
6620833	6623335	It's either going to be the best year or it's going to be the worst year.
6624091	6626212	It could all be over after this year, honestly.
6627032	6627392	It could.
6627452	6635594	I think that's a possibility that these dance games all do fair and they all cancel each other out.
6637294	6638414	That's a distinct possibility.
6638654	6642115	But I think that E3 is going to be a very interesting show this year.
6642615	6644356	I'm very much looking forward to E3.
6644416	6645356	I wish I could go.
6645496	6647537	Final exams are a bitch because I can't.
6648597	6649377	That sucks, man.
6649980	6650220	Madesco
6673447	6673727	Maybe?
6674407	6675087	Mastiff Games.
6675268	6675928	Mastiff Games.
6675988	6678068	Mastiff was making it, but they weren't publishing it, were they?
6678508	6681329	I thought they were just the ones making it, and Animero themselves was publishing it.
6682630	6683570	It's the other way around.
6683730	6691072	Animero is the maker of Pump It Up, and Mastiff Games are... What the fuck do I know?
6691452	6691752	All right.
6692952	6693573	It's all good.
6694193	6695613	All right, Elmullet, thanks for the call.
6696133	6696613	No problem.
6696653	6697994	Oh, wait, plug your site.
6698674	6699874	InsidePulse.com.
6699974	6700354	There you go.
6700394	6701115	All right, have a good one.
6701675	6701855	Bye.
6701935	6702215	Bye-bye.
6703055	6708238	I definitely want to get to... Oh, damn it, just... There was another call coming in on the other line.
6708278	6709259	Oh, here, good, he's calling back.
6709279	6714021	And I think this is somebody who supports a lot of what In The Groove is doing, from what I hear in the chat rooms.
6714061	6714822	This should be a good call.
6715362	6716383	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6717403	6719004	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
6719064	6721005	Hello, SSJ100 Matt, how are you?
6721766	6722386	Pretty good.
6722486	6726528	Now, this has got to be your first or second call into the station as well, right?
6727029	6727669	Yeah, my first.
6727849	6728469	Your first!
6728569	6729730	Oh, another virgin!
6730390	6731171	Welcome to the show.
6731650	6732531	Thank you for calling in.
6733072	6737196	Now, I know you've got some opinions on the In The Groove stuff, so let's hear it.
6737897	6739078	Yeah, I got a little opinion.
6739098	6739519	What's up?
6740260	6742862	I actually got a little story beforehand about it.
6743243	6743563	Alright.
6744584	6746246	I'm out in Phoenix, Arizona.
6746747	6749750	They just got In The Groove, I think.
6750371	6753174	Well, I went to the arcade and
6755912	6757672	Buddy, you're breaking up a little bit.
6757732	6759713	I don't know if you can hear me, but you're starting to break up there.
6759733	6760813	Damn it, I wanted to hear this too.
6761113	6762093	You're breaking up there a little bit.
6762153	6766194	See if you have anything else running in the background that you can try and pause or something.
6766255	6766675	I don't know.
6766735	6767935	Sometimes it's just a bad connection.
6767975	6771196	But see if you've got something there that you can pause or stop or something.
6771556	6771976	Try again.
6772816	6773397	Can you hear me now?
6774097	6775417	You're still a little bit broken up.
6777998	6778338	You know what?
6778418	6779638	Try calling us right back, bud.
6779818	6780358	Try doing that.
6780799	6780999	All right.
6781019	6781599	Let's see if that helps.
6781899	6782099	Later.
6782981	6789205	I'm going to go ahead and let him call right back, because sometimes that helps the connection a little bit, just to kind of redo it there, because I want to let him have a chance to talk.
6790426	6791186	All right, you there?
6792067	6792527	Yeah, I'm here.
6792767	6793568	Okay, it's clear again.
6793648	6794148	Tell your story.
6794708	6794968	Okay.
6795729	6801172	Anyways, I went to Golfland, and they ran over there, jumped on it.
6801432	6805795	I was about to put in my money for it, and I realized it wasn't in the groove.
6805835	6810638	It just had, like, the stuff all around it, and it ended up being a third-mixed DDR machine.
6810658	6810938	Okay.
6813070	6815834	That's kind of like that Megamix DDR.
6815894	6818257	It looks like an extreme, but oh my god.
6819098	6819739	Don't fall off.
6821782	6830454	But, you know what, I've yet to try it, and I want to give everything a chance like I do with Red Sox fans and German people, so...
6832238	6836399	I thought you were somebody in our chatroom, because I mentioned this before I picked up your call.
6836799	6843801	I thought you were somebody in the chatroom that was really supporting everything that the Rockstar folks are doing within the groove and are pretty open-minded to what's going on here.
6844481	6844781	Is that true?
6844801	6846982	I don't know where you got that from.
6847002	6848702	Oh, shit, I guess I'm getting you confused with somebody else.
6848762	6849722	My bad, I'm sorry.
6850983	6852183	It's okay.
6852203	6855784	So you're just more having an open mind in the groove and what's going on.
6856164	6858345	Yeah, I'll try it out when it comes.
6859025	6860045	All right, sounds good.
6860478	6863479	What do you think about the impact this is going to have on DDR?
6865539	6868179	You know what, I'm sure DDR will come up with something.
6868919	6871300	Everything happens for a reason, so we'll see.
6872340	6879781	Maybe the release of In the Groove will kind of light a fire under Konami of America's ass to do something new with DDR?
6881762	6882622	We'll see, I don't know.
6882662	6889823	I think In the Groove knows that Konami will kick their ass either way, so...
6892351	6898679	So you think, regardless of this In The Groove pumping up stuff, Konami will still be king in the end?
6899380	6899820	Probably.
6900381	6905007	I agree with that, but I still think In The Groove has the potential to make a pretty fat dent.
6906449	6906569	Mm-hmm.
6906890	6907070	So...
6908038	6909279	Loki, you look like you want to say no.
6909579	6910640	No, I don't think so.
6911360	6916904	You don't think that on the red octane pads that everybody buys, because Konami doesn't do their own pads anymore.
6917464	6920647	I mean, they do, but in such limited release, it's negligent.
6921227	6925210	So, on these red octane pads, they won't try to sell in the groove.
6925790	6929633	And you won't start seeing bundle packs of in the groove with these red octane pads like everywhere.
6929773	6936077	Well, I'm sure you'll see packs within the groove, but no one buys a dance pad without knowing the game that they're going to play for it.
6936637	6937338	That's just retarded.
6938340	6939903	What about grandmas buying it for their kids?
6940323	6944149	Because they hear on the news about the dance game that makes people lose weight.
6944309	6945391	And they all look the same to her.
6947094	6948255	Grandma, you saying I'm fat?
6955049	6955569	Hey, what's that?
6955769	6958350	No, that's just a Skype message.
6958370	6958730	Sorry, go ahead.
6958891	6959971	That's just Grandma on TV.
6960011	6969395	But see, Grandma might not know, and so she'll ask the teenager working behind the counter, Whoa, what game does this work for?
6969415	6977198	And they'll be like, well, that works for Dance Dance Revolution, because that's the one they're familiar with, and not like, you know, that works with Britney's Dance Beat, you know, or something like that.
6977805	6983170	So DDR is kind of like Kleenex.
6983490	6987013	Instead of being a tissue, it's a Kleenex.
6987033	6988554	Something like that.
6988674	6993679	There was a whole semantics argument about this in the Quirks animated thing.
6995741	6997622	It's Xerox.
6998343	7005409	I don't remember the exact terminology, but once a product becomes so familiar that any product is known by that name, then it loses its trademarks.
7006860	7014688	Yeah, it's like, you know, for example, like gelatin, you know, or a band-aid, okay?
7014888	7016930	It's not a band-aid, it's an adhesive strip.
7017090	7017551	Right, right.
7018051	7018992	You know, something like that.
7019533	7023016	Well, people are going to be buying, you know, it's fine.
7023216	7026159	Go ahead and buy in the groove, you know, go ahead and buy it for your kids.
7026500	7030544	But when they go and try to play it, they're going to get bored with it and they're going to return it.
7030564	7030884	We'll see.
7031385	7033727	All right, I want to get back to the caller, though, because the caller is on.
7033767	7037450	So anything else you want to share with us, SSJ100, Matt, on your thoughts on the group?
7037850	7041393	Yeah, one more thing besides in the group.
7041793	7045756	My arcade just got a Beatmania Red 2DX machine.
7046096	7046677	Ah, very cool.
7046697	7047257	What do you think of that?
7048198	7052161	Well, you know, I'm not a real big fan of it, because, you know, I've tried it a couple times, and, you know...
7053503	7057784	I usually get yelled at or get dirty looks by the people who actually do play.
7074992	7084037	You put your money in, you waited just as long as they did to play, you put your money in the machine, you have the right to play whatever song you want, however you want, and they can just sit there and wait their turn.
7084698	7087740	Well, you know, I'm a New Yorker, so I don't really give a shit what they say either way.
7090201	7091442	Well, amen to that, I guess.
7093984	7102189	There's plenty of other people, you know, with DDR who do that, or just like that, you know, that goes out to Danbury and Palisades people.
7103030	7110638	And Rob, to go back to what you were saying about the DDR and the Groove Bundles, that type of thing, where they're not going to know the difference.
7127423	7128384	Well, okay.
7128604	7129364	Well, that's the case.
7129584	7134467	Who the fuck's gonna buy an ignition pad when they can buy a bundle with DDR for 60 bucks?
7135588	7137629	But how often do you see those bundles with DDRs?
7138069	7138589	Quite often.
7138729	7139410	Depends where you go.
7140991	7141691	Like, fries.
7142612	7145633	I haven't seen bundles there since the week the DDR came out.
7147394	7147954	They'll be around.
7148235	7148595	Trust me.
7149395	7149715	I don't know.
7149755	7150176	I disagree.
7150276	7150736	Alright, let's see.
7150876	7153257	One more quick call, then we gotta get into the cage match and all that stuff.
7153297	7154178	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
7155046	7157627	Hi, my name is Ranma, and I'm an OLR-holic.
7157787	7159368	Hello, OLR-holic.
7159648	7161009	Hail the OLR-me.
7161309	7162490	Hail to the OLR-me.
7163230	7163890	Humvee.
7165271	7165571	What?
7165891	7166792	Humvee?
7166912	7167272	Humvee.
7167612	7168653	What's on your mind, Ranma?
7169373	7169753	Not much.
7169793	7171054	I just want to say a couple of things.
7171955	7173415	I'm all for it.
7173555	7174396	I'm happy for it.
7175136	7176917	I'd like to see more games.
7176937	7177457	That's all it is.
7177497	7178258	I'm happy for it.
7178518	7180539	You just want the game orgy.
7181474	7182414	Hey, I'm all for it.
7182434	7185675	This gives me a reason to go out and buy it.
7186355	7187796	I'm having fun with playing DDR.
7187976	7189376	In the group?
7189436	7189957	Hey, I'll buy it.
7190017	7190417	Pump it up?
7190577	7190997	I'll buy it.
7191477	7195578	I think that's a fair perspective to have, and I feel a little bit similar.
7196018	7201680	Although part of my mentality is that whole Blood Crypts thing where I don't think that they should be invading on my turf.
7202205	7203386	I was so anti-pump it up for the longest.
7203406	7206909	And then I saw some hot chick playing it and I was like, I want to start playing that game.
7226846	7229387	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7247115	7250919	I know, it's blatantly stolen from Step Mania, but that's all In The Groove is, right?
7250979	7252981	No, it's actually blatantly stolen from Disney's games.
7253061	7254483	Well, that too, that too, that too.
7254583	7255303	Whatever magic.
7255684	7267376	That too, but I'm glad Ranma brought that up, because I wanted to say, that is another thing that In The Groove has going for it, is that it is incorporating the battle mode, and I always said, I've said this for years now, how long have we been doing this show?
7267536	7267957	Years!
7268863	7270024	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
7288755	7292196	But I give them props for going there, where Konami has not gone there.
7292216	7300758	At least, you know, when it comes down to, you know, oh, we're making the game for the fans, at least they can go, well, the fans want it faster, as in, you know, Extreme Plus or something like that.
7301278	7304619	At least they're kind of, you know, catering it towards the fans and that type of thing.
7305059	7312041	And to be honest, if Konami's not going to do anything about it, then, well, they deserve to lose the market share for it, because, hey, it's their own damn fault.
7312441	7313301	You know, we can't be...
7314031	7315172	And they gotta do something.
7341167	7344909	I still go back to, I think it's, we don't know what tricks Konami has up their sleeve.
7345249	7348190	They could trump us all and announce an E3.
7348910	7349330	You know what?
7349390	7349850	We don't know.
7349990	7355032	But they could trump this whole fucking thing and an E3 this year, they announce 2DX USA.
7356212	7356772	They could.
7356952	7359353	That would be the biggest F you to all of us.
7360913	7365095	They could do that, but I think I know the reason why Konami's just sitting on their asses about it.
7365195	7366115	I think I know the reason.
7366315	7368316	I don't think they're sitting on their asses about it.
7368376	7369276	I think that it's the...
7371104	7373044	I agree here.
7373104	7382809	And when we say that Konami is sitting on our ass, please realize we are talking about the corporate people who make these types of decisions about what is being released in Arcade Not.
7383069	7385530	The people actually making the games, i.e.
7385610	7394794	Konami of Hawaii, is doing an outstanding, incredible, wonderful, I lavish so much praise upon Konami.
7395490	7397832	The Ultramix 2 product, it's not even funny.
7398092	7400034	That is exactly what DDR needed.
7400795	7405979	The unfortunate thing is, because of the corporate end of it, we're not seeing as much of it as we should be.
7406019	7408241	It took the fans to get us DDR in the first place.
7408782	7412725	And honestly, we owe a whole lot to Jason Enos for getting it at all.
7412745	7413226	Absolutely.
7413506	7414066	Absolutely.
7414227	7419391	In the groove would not exist, period, if it wasn't for Jason Enos.
7420072	7420332	Mm-hmm.
7421380	7423804	But like I was saying, I was meant the corporate end of it too.
7424826	7428271	Do you guys remember that whole Konami and Amuro lawsuit from like years ago?
7428472	7429012	Oh, of course.
7429073	7429914	It always gets brought up.
7431476	7435383	In discussion of In the Groove legalities, that lawsuit always gets brought up, but yes.
7436283	7445106	If I'm not mistaken, it wasn't after everything was said and done, Konami was kind of helping them or something like that, and they were getting some type of royalty or kickback or something like that?
7445346	7454769	That's the rumor, but I've heard about five different results of that, and I have yet to see anything concrete, or at least it seems like all the different answers have something concrete to go with it.
7455169	7461211	So I think we're just going to do what we did last year, and when we talk to somebody at Konami, we'll just ask.
7462272	7462772	There you go.
7463932	7465653	We'll just ask and see what we can find out.
7466488	7467108	I'll do it again.
7467229	7469350	Not that they'll tell us anything, but hey, we'll ask.
7470311	7471071	We have no shame.
7471651	7473272	We have no reputation to ruin.
7473993	7478056	We are already a disrespected station.
7478196	7480917	We can't even, you know, we can't go any lower than we are already.
7481998	7482819	Hey, that works for me.
7482979	7483299	Alright.
7484700	7489103	And my Best Buy store still has leftover red Octane pants from the holiday rush.
7491081	7492862	All the cheap pads just fly off the shelves.
7492903	7495064	Does your GameStop need a plug as well?
7495685	7496305	No, Best Buy.
7496345	7497026	Oh, sorry, Best Buy.
7497046	7498387	Does your Best Buy need a plug as well?
7498967	7502610	Not really, because people look at me as a local DDR anime guru.
7503991	7507594	Every time they buy DDR or whatever, I tell them, get the pads, get the red octane pads.
7507634	7509776	If you want to play and have fun, get the pads.
7510136	7513019	These pads over here are not even going to last you six months, if that.
7513219	7514099	Get the red octanes.
7514480	7516301	A hundred bucks, but trust me, they're worth it.
7517702	7518583	I agree, I agree.
7519844	7522025	Alright, but we're going to let you go so we can get into some other segments.
7522065	7524026	Any other thoughts you wanted to get out, though, before we let you go?
7525546	7526387	Stop buying iPods.
7526747	7527047	Please.
7527167	7528047	Make my job easier.
7528127	7530088	Stop buying them.
7530428	7531329	I will stop.
7531489	7535470	I will be content with the one I have and not buy any more.
7535530	7535891	How's that?
7537251	7537671	It works.
7538772	7539132	Alright.
7539792	7540172	Thank you.
7540212	7540813	That's all I have to say.
7540873	7541813	Thank you and good night.
7541913	7542854	Love you guys.
7542894	7543314	Good night.
7543334	7543594	Bye.
7545955	7548796	Alright, we're going to go ahead and close off the Skype line there.
7549918	7550138	Live365.com
7571195	7574396	The site that we stream our station through.
7574416	7578637	They're good enough to provide us with the bandwidth so that all you folks can listen to Orange Lounge Radio.
7579077	7582818	Live 365 is doing their award ceremony again this year.
7582918	7583298	Oh, God.
7583958	7585798	And the nominations are going on right now.
7586118	7587579	You guys may or may not remember this.
7587619	7590399	I was trying to look for the sound file of this earlier, but I couldn't find it.
7590979	7598441	We were nominated for a Best of Live 365 award last year in Station Least Likely to Hear on AMFM Radio, which is so us, if you think about it.
7599671	7600152	and DarkSakura.com
7621608	7623089	They forgot to mention us.
7623389	7624670	Our name was left off the envelope.
7624690	7632334	So they're like, and the nominees are the Pokemon Radio Channel, the Porno Music Channel, the whatever stations we're up against.
7632714	7633614	And then they left us off.
7634215	7638757	And we were like, and it's so funny because you can hear us in the live stream of the awards.
7638797	7640338	You hear us in the background going, hey!
7642379	7644520	And then they're like, oh, oh, an Orange Lounge.
7644600	7646081	And we're like, at that point, we're like, well, fuck.
7646645	7648407	I found my bag of free CDs I got from there.
7669682	7672024	SSJ100 Matt is absolutely right.
7672344	7674545	We were like Scorsese.
7674965	7676326	We knew how Scorsese felt.
7677567	7678668	Only we're not assholes.
7680449	7682570	We're going for the Susan Lucci this year.
7682950	7687913	We want to get nominated again, and we'll probably lose again even if we get nominated, but that's okay.
7687953	7689814	But in order to get nominated, we need your help.
7690275	7695418	Please check out our LiveJournal community for all the details on how you can nominate us online.
7695871	7697851	Now, we're not driving down there again, are we?
7697971	7698391	Yes, we are.
7698912	7702172	I am at least going, and whoever else wants to go will go.
7702832	7705513	I will make Angel wear the orange hat if you're not going to do it.
7705553	7706273	I'll go do it.
7706553	7706873	All right.
7709113	7716095	Oh, God, I can see the pictures now, and I'm so going to get... I should go topless and paint my nipples orange.
7716155	7716715	And you know what?
7716775	7724316	And if you are in the Bay Area, I want you bitches there at the ceremony to cheer us on when we lose.
7726986	7729667	But in order for us to lose, we have to be nominated.
7730107	7735669	So, visit www.orangehoundsradio.com, click on Live Journal Community, and look at the recent post.
7736269	7738629	It tells you all about what we're looking for.
7739730	7743051	Ask a friend in the chatroom, ask an op in the chatroom, they'll tell you how to vote for us.
7743391	7747632	Look at live365.com, and click on the nominations form.
7747912	7750153	And honestly, just nominate us and everything.
7750493	7750673	Just...
7751923	7755705	But be sure you put station name Orange Lounge, not Orange Lounge Radio.
7755745	7757946	You have to put station name Orange Lounge.
7758527	7759127	All one word.
7760027	7767111	We are trying to get some of our buddy stations nominated, so please consider Best Soundtrack Station, DDR Freak.
7767391	7768752	We're trying to get them nominated there.
7769272	7773675	And Best Station Under 500 Hours, Under Station Live.
7773715	7774995	We're trying to get them nominated as well.
7775256	7776216	So for your consideration.
7776236	7777637	That is all in the Live Journal community.
7778357	7779658	Do not vote for the porno music.
7781051	7783253	I think they're ineligible because they won last year.
7783553	7786915	So our biggest competition this year is the Pokemon music.
7786955	7790178	And then that crazy, like, whatever radio, the Paranormal.
7790478	7791739	Don't listen to that Paranormal.
7791759	7791799	Oh!
7791879	7793180	The Paranormal Station!
7793200	7793660	That was rad.
7793680	7794901	The Paranormal Station sucks.
7794921	7800145	You need to listen to, if you're going to listen to the Paranormal, listen to, what was that, the AM show that's on?
7800185	7801025	I gotta, I can't remember.
7801165	7804007	Well, you know why the Paranormal folks didn't go to the awards ceremony?
7805548	7807550	They were afraid that the man was going to get them?
7807570	7807910	No, they are.
7807930	7808871	You just told them not to?
7808951	7809231	What?
7809331	7810472	They already knew they weren't going to win.
7815745	7816705	Pokemon Radio.
7816725	7818345	What the fuck is Pokemon Radio?
7818385	7818906	You know what?
7818926	7822807	Is there enough music in that show to be a radio station?
7823047	7824027	You best believe it.
7824167	7825268	There is a lot of stuff.
7825288	7825948	Pokemon!
7827468	7828849	Gotta catch them all!
7829929	7830369	You know what?
7830569	7835571	I can't dog on the Pokemon Radio station because I've seen the guy posting around the forums and he's actually a pretty nice guy.
7836791	7838512	That doesn't mean I don't want to beat him.
7840379	7840779	No.
7842060	7847502	We're all friends, you know, at the end of the day, but, you know, it's just like, WHO DO YOU LOVE MORE, PEOPLE?
7847662	7848843	It's just like this, okay?
7849223	7852264	When I go and play Cusar, I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.
7852424	7855445	Do you want- At the end of the day, we're friends, but I'm gonna fucking kick your ass.
7855505	7856006	Seriously.
7857026	7862588	If you don't vote for Orange Lingerie, if you don't go and nominate us, you're basically giving Pikachu this award.
7863369	7867110	You're supporting terrorism if you do not vote for Orange Lingerie.
7868811	7869431	Terrorism.
7870458	7871258	Thanks for watching!
7892344	7893405	Support Internet Radio.

7937805	7938626	Alright, let's get into it.
7938666	7939346	Three songs.
7939406	7940367	Here's the first one.
7940427	7941968	A clip of last week's winner.
7942409	7948874	Who, by the way, dethroned Freeze Pop and Stakeout, robbing it of the retirement.
7949474	7952557	And that was all thanks to the tiebreaker vote from Jamie.
7952957	7954378	So this song went in instead.
7954518	7958482	It's The Dignity of Labor with XRV, the Never Rock a Mix.
7958502	7958902	Here's a clip.
8090605	8113464	There is no form I cannot penetrate If only you could see the pain I feel in you A mirror to your soul is free Without a trace of vanity I'll share with you the mastery Reveal your agony with a copy
8115345	8116348	Thanks for watching!
8144252	8148293	All right, kids, that was a clip of song number one, The Dignity of Labor with XRV.
8148433	8153554	Last week's winner, here are two new songs that you're going to hear in their entirety now.
8154074	8158435	Your vote will determine which one goes into rotation all week long on the station.
8158475	8159475	Here is song number two.
8159916	8160716	It's my pick.
8161376	8165517	I'm picking a band called Day Behavior, which you know from Ultramix 2.
8165577	8166297	They did the song Starlight.
8167533	8170217	Last week's winner, Jamie's asking what song number one was.
8170477	8174843	Last week's winner, Dignity of Labor with XRV, Loki's pick.
8174883	8177326	Remember you broke the tie and stole it from Freeze Pop?
8178227	8181191	I'm sorry, I had to huck up a lung cookie in Freeze Pop's honor.
8183061	8189665	Anyway, the song I picked, I picked a song by Day Behavior, who did the song Close Your Eyes and Superstar in Ultramix 2.
8189985	8192947	They have a song on their CD, what the hell's the name of the CD?
8192987	8194228	Have You Ever Touched a Dream?
8194688	8198991	And it's a fluffy CD, it's like a fluffy little cotton candy cloud, I like it.
8199391	8204494	And this song is called Mona Me, and I like this song, so this is my pick for tonight's stage match.
8204554	8206195	Day Behavior with Mona Me, enjoy.
8206215	8212519	La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
8213021	8242126	La la la la la la me Fall in love with the day Whatever I say I'm finally on my own It's imprint from my fingers when I squeeze this bloody heart I hear a stranger when I speak A movement from the dark It's a sweet and sour combination
8260482	8276329	I'm coming to stay, I'm finally on my way Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na Na-na-na-na-na
8290623	8298375	I'd like to come home in the night And have a room without you The Beauty Maker is like a band of fire
8313793	8316154	I'm coming to play, I'm finally on my way
8360046	8369533	La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La La
8394859	8396640	Thanks for watching!
8428180	8442645	Alright, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Day Behavior with Monami, and let's see if the folks in studio like that, even though it's not really their decision, it's yours, but it doesn't stop us from giving you our big fat opinions, starting off with DarkSakura.
8443705	8447767	It's an okay song, but I don't like her voice, so it gets a seven.
8449347	8450248	Seven from Jamie.
8450368	8450628	Loki.
8451664	8462515	I was saying that it reminded me of the one woman that was singing from Aurora in Ordinary World.
8462755	8466518	It sort of reminded me of that, at least voice-wise, but it was okay.
8468100	8471904	I like day behavior, but it's a little too happy for me.
8472104	8473926	I mean, I guess it's okay.
8474626	8475327	I'll give it an 8.
8477225	8480128	I was actually expecting you to, like, give it a zero, but that's cool.
8480168	8486353	No, I mean, it wasn't, like, it wasn't freeze-pop annoying, so, um, it, no, it's, it's okay, I mean.
8486674	8486974	Alright.
8486994	8489756	I'm open to new type of music, except for freeze-pop.
8490157	8492159	I ain't gonna complain, an eight's a pretty good score.
8492739	8492979	Alright.
8493560	8494060	Arcadian.
8495221	8495742	It isn't bad.
8496242	8500226	Uh, I'll probably get tired of it after I have to listen to it several times, so I'll give it a seven.
8501087	8502007	Seven from Arcadian.
8502028	8502208	Uh, Angel.
8502288	8502468	Angel.
8503642	8509046	I picture that song like being in some happy-go-lucky anime music video or something.
8510527	8511027	Probably a 7.
8511087	8512488	Yeah, I'll just give it a 7.
8514109	8519153	I think that song's awesome because it sounds like it should be the background music in Postal 2.
8519193	8521894	Oh my god, that was hilarious.
8521914	8522895	We'll get into that later.
8522935	8523696	I give it a 9.
8525657	8529660	Alright, let's go on to the third song brought to us by DarkSakura.
8529720	8531601	She's going with an old favorite tonight.
8533228	8538630	I, for a while, was getting really, really annoyed by Hamasaki Ayumi's voice, just because she's very nasal.
8539230	8541191	But then I remembered how much I like this mix.
8541911	8544352	So, um, I think it's, um, Kanaria?
8544592	8544872	Mm-hmm.
8545353	8547033	So, um, yeah, that one.
8547153	8549434	And it's one of the, uh, IRO tracks.
8550214	8550655	I think.
8552315	8552575	All right.
8553356	8554536	Can't go wrong with IU trance.
8554986	8555467	Or can you?
8555567	8555927	We'll see.
8556007	8556668	It is IU Trance.
8556688	8558610	I'm sorry.
8558650	8560432	I kind of wonder if she has a new IU Trance.
8560532	8564336	It's been a while since number three.
8564357	8564797	We'll see.
8565077	8565978	I'll check CD Japan.
8566359	8566539	All right.
8566559	8568801	Well, let's see if this is worthy of a cage match win.
8568902	8574928	It's Hamasaki Ayumi, or if you pronounce it the other way around, it's Ayumi Hamasaki, with Kanaria.
8575229	8575449	Enjoy.
8675587	8676670	Thanks for watching!
8794049	8799156	Song number three, Ayumi Hamasaki or Hamasaki Ayumi, however you prefer.
8799517	8800058	Kanaria.
8802461	8802801	Jamie.
8804103	8806927	I'm getting it for my dislike of trance, too.
8808068	8808429	Nine.
8809610	8810872	Nine from DarkSakura.
8811092	8811413	Bogey.
8812847	8813728	Are You Trance is good.
8813768	8815469	I haven't listened to that in a long time.
8815970	8821054	Mainly because I treat my CDs like crap and I throw them behind my seat when I'm done listening to them.
8821494	8824257	And then I wonder why they're scratched and stuff like that.
8825117	8831983	So I give that an 8 because it's not one of my favorite songs on there, but it was still pretty good.
8834785	8835166	Sounds good.
8835446	8835866	Arcadian, 42.
8836247	8838849	Good, I'll give it an 8.
8838909	8839029	Angel.
8839970	8840170	Angel.
8841866	8842286	It's only nine.
8842306	8845369	I don't know, just like...
8869984	8871964	Am Above and Beyond, I love that one.
8872084	8876905	In fact, I have that song, Burned, again, on my latest CD.
8876945	8880406	I'm listening to my car, Am Above and Beyond, again, because I love listening to that song.
8881126	8888168	And then there was the other one that Bomani Religious did for a long-ass time ago, but that one was pretty good, too.
8888228	8889348	I can't remember the name of it.
8889488	8891429	That whole CD is sex, honestly.
8891969	8892649	IU Trans 1.
8893309	8893529	Anyway.
8894241	8895562	Anyway, let's let the chairman vote.
8895582	8896382	Let's do a recap.
8896703	8900865	Alright, you can place your vote right after this recap of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
8900905	8904047	Song number one, Dignity of Labor, XRV, Never Rock-A-Mix.
8904868	8907729	Song number two, Day Behavior, Mon Ami.
8923756	8927099	and song number three, Ayumi Hamasaki, Kanada Ya.
8939790	8942192	Please vote now.
8942312	8944894	Send a private message to Sky, S-K-I-E.
8944974	8947977	That's me in the chat room with your vote and I will tally them up.
8948755	8949838	and let you know who won.
8950019	8951704	So stay tuned to find out the winner.
8951724	8953329	So place vote now.
8954292	8954793	Meantime...
8956244	8960787	Loki, I know there's no point in me asking you this anymore, but you know I've got to ask.
8960847	8962568	I feel like we owe it to the listeners.
8962948	8964489	Is there any sim scene news this week?
8967110	8977797	There's only one thing I can think of off the top of my head, and it's just something that's been going on for a while, but it's worth mentioning since all the other websites that had links to them are gone.
8979137	8981119	On Aaron in Japan, there's a forum.
8981339	8983360	I can't remember the thread name for the life of me.
8983760	8984040	and so on.
9004412	9005352	They're just sets.
9005692	9008393	For example, they have DDR Fever or whatever.
9009234	9010274	And stuff like that.
9010294	9012655	DDR Extreme something.
9013856	9018838	But there's a lot of new sim files on there that you could be listening to and playing and stuff.
9019218	9029963	They're brand new, but the problem is since all those websites went down like DDR Maniacs and DDR UK that used to link to them where they'd be able to announce that stuff it's harder to find them now.
9030083	9030303	So
9031380	9032140	Check that out.
9032641	9046129	And once again, my favorite thing to do, at least it used to be back in the day when Bomani Sims was still around, is to go just do a simple search for DDR DWI or something, and you'd be surprised.
9046149	9048190	You can find a whole lot of Japanese...
9048755	9050156	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9067773	9069794	I don't know, just check that stuff out there.
9070655	9080299	You can also find stuff, I believe, that, of course, the DDRUK channel is still open on IRC, and I'm sure all your official sim files are still there.
9082180	9087463	And who knows, maybe they even have, like, a new song for the new Ultramix pack.
9087563	9091805	But, yeah, so just go check those out.
9092165	9093245	Just do some searching.
9093446	9094246	Google is your friend.
9096678	9097960	Alright, sounds good.
9099362	9104028	This is worth mentioning too, because it's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of SimScene related.
9104809	9111178	It's another DDR game born from, I think, SimScene, the SimScene, and that's that Neon FM.
9111519	9111739	Yeah.
9111839	9113021	Launched a website this week.
9113682	9113842	Yes.
9114876	9116738	That was... I think we mentioned it a while back.
9117018	9118559	We did, but... I did mention it a while back.
9118579	9126085	It was... In the music production thread on Bumai Style, there was a group, a company that was looking for artists to do music for a new dance game.
9126545	9133791	That is the new dance game, and... But it's relevant again because it's... The website launched and everything.
9138154	9143859	Anyways... So... There was... Yeah, for example, there was...
9144943	9156817	God, uh, there's some of the people from, um, the DWI Palace, um, it's like Dave and DJ Slash, I believe.
9158239	9171851	and they were actually, they're listed on there, DJ Potatoes on there Thomas Howard with, what was it, the World's, I can't remember Wasn't there a song called like Girls Butts or something like that in there?
9171871	9180278	No, it's not like that, but there's a World's like Cure, World's something We played it a long ass time ago on the station and it sucked
9182142	9187188	I thought Freeze Pop with Stakeout is in it.
9187889	9189651	Jazzy Kid is in there.
9189711	9190532	That's kind of cool.
9191232	9194476	I want to say that wasn't DM Ashura on there too?
9194696	9195858	I'm pretty sure he was.
9196418	9196979	I think so.
9197822	9205027	I heard a rumor, now maybe this is just a rumor, I heard a rumor that Ashura was kind of pissed at the In The Groove folks because one of the songs takes a riff from him or something.
9205087	9209030	Yes, and it's that one that they actually have the videos for from In The Groove 2.
9209951	9217656	It basically follows the same pattern as, well first off it rips off Max, and then you also have
9218152	9222195	Rick Safa, Neomax, you know, with the piano slowdown type of thing.
9224657	9227799	So you've got that on there, and he's just kind of pissed off at that.
9228179	9235704	To be honest, I would like to see this Neon FM or whatever it is, Neon whatever it is, come out and kick ass.
9235764	9238866	But it looks a little weird, I think, from what I've seen.
9238926	9247192	Isn't it like, it's like five... It's a five panel layout, and it's laid out like five key beat mania, which I think is very odd.
9248587	9252108	Yeah, so, I don't know.
9254708	9255768	But odd in a good way.
9256088	9258129	Like, I want to try it.
9258169	9258809	It seems different.
9258869	9261269	It's a different way to have it laid out and it sounds like fun.
9261309	9263270	I mean, it's feat mania.
9267110	9275912	I don't know if you remember, way back in the day, there was a humongous five-key controller.
9276693	9277193	I remember.
9277213	9278374	Didn't somebody do one?
9278754	9279054	Yeah.
9280075	9280915	It was a big joke.
9280935	9289019	Didn't we set it up one time at some Bomani party where we went into the key config and we changed all the keys for B-Media so we could play it with our feet on the dance pad?
9289419	9290040	Kind of funny.
9290780	9296023	But no, this was like a joke that was on like, not, it was like two DDR Freak boards ago.
9296043	9299465	A joke that was going around.
9300905	9301906	I think back on the green board.
9304707	9305107	I think so.
9305287	9305708	I think you're right.
9305868	9306348	It's that old.
9307133	9315458	But what I can like about this game, and this is interesting because, you know, here we go, I just talked about this whole, you know, in the groove is invading on DDR space.
9315758	9321222	But what I like about this Neon FM, they're going to have to do a new cabinet because it's a new dance layout.
9321922	9323583	And it's a new dance layout.
9323643	9326345	The game looks a lot different because of it.
9326605	9329567	I'm kind of curious to see what becomes of this game.
9329587	9335731	I can appreciate this game over in the groove because it's not trying to be a DDR, it's trying to be a dance game.
9335951	9336231	Dance.
9336731	9338372	I give props to this game.
9338732	9342615	Even though the song list is kind of weird, at least it has freeze pop, and that's cool.
9342915	9344956	So, I'm cool with this so far.
9345216	9348959	Yeah, so, I mean, at least they're getting talented people to make the music.
9349039	9351200	No offense to the group of people, but, I mean...
9352775	9359120	There's a lot of talented Bomani fan people out there that are making music.
9359881	9361402	I think it stands a pretty good chance.
9361422	9367527	The layout's a little weird, but I've got to try it before I can actually pass judgment on it.
9367807	9368528	We'll see, huh?
9368648	9369929	It still looks funky.
9370569	9374713	It kind of reminds me almost like Steppin' Music, but Steppin' Music's more like...
9375553	9378215	You know, um... Spider Stomp.
9380057	9381298	God, Spider Stomp.
9382139	9382859	That game's fun.
9383880	9386082	Our first arcade dancing experience.
9386602	9388524	Stepping on those big shiny buttons.
9388984	9395850	God, I remember freestyling Spider Stomp at the, uh... Vacaville... Or, not Vacaville, the, um...
9397748	9405171	Dublin, like, QZAR, because there was no DDR there, so I had to play something.
9407511	9409332	Alright, we're going to go to a break.
9409712	9414254	When we come back from the break, I'm going to announce the winner of the Orange Laundry to a cage match, and we've got to get into the FUs of the week!
9414274	9416654	It's going to be awesome.
9418135	9421036	In this break, I don't know, how about...
9422335	9423555	How about Feelings Won't Fade?
9423575	9424675	I haven't played that song in a while.
9424735	9427836	Since we heard a System F remix, let's hear a song by System SF.
9428616	9441198	I fucking hate System SF because they rip off System F. God damn it, that guy was one of the founders of modern trance nowadays, and it really pisses me off that they rip off his style and his song.
9441318	9443159	Well, we're going to hear this song anyway, because I like this song.
9443199	9443939	Okay, fine.
9443999	9447060	We'll be back after this with the Cage Match winner, the FU's of the week, and more.
9447140	9447600	We'll be back.
9448160	9448560	Orange Lounge Radio.
9448580	9449360	Orange Lounge Radio.
9670701	9671452	Thanks for watching!
9715035	9717036	Thank you for watching!
9899484	9900765	Bitch, get a new song.
9900965	9904246	An open letter from Orange Lounge Radio.
9928863	9930805	Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
9931586	9934849	And we're going to get into the cage... No, we already did the cage match.
9934869	9935929	We're going to get into the cage match.
9936070	9936530	Victor!
9936910	9937771	Cage match two!
9937811	9938212	Woo!
9939693	9943496	Yes, it's cage match two in a brand new cabinet and a red interface.
9945418	9946399	Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
9948422	9949663	It's now on widescreen, though.
9972070	9973312	There were good songs, I guess.
9973472	9974333	There were good songs in there.
9974573	9976655	System SF, Feelings Won't Fade, starting it off.
9976735	9981160	After that, Midi Head, our buddy Midi Head with In My Eyes, the Midi Head remix from Ultramix 2.
9981761	9985204	After that, John Robinson with K'Kak from 2DX Red.
9985244	9986726	That's K-E-C-A-K.
9987387	9990370	And lastly, Yoga with Dom Dariam.
9991531	9992212	Kit Kat?
9992932	9993313	K'Kak!
9995987	9998588	Sounds like a cat coughing up a hairball.
10000529	10002529	No, cat coughing up a hairball is this.
10005570	10010011	That's right, you would have experience with cats and them coughing up hairballs.
10011811	10012252	Anyway.
10012372	10014232	Poor Shermie sounds like she's going to choke.
10014512	10016353	Let's hear who won tonight's cage match, shall we?
10017153	10017673	Eh, okay.
10017773	10021294	By one vote, we have a new cage match winner.
10023954	10045347	Ayumi Hamasaki With the STD song, when I say it in my white accent, Conneria You know they have cream for that When you read it, it looks like Conneria
10049207	10050388	Alright, so there it is.
10050668	10052510	Song number three, your winner tonight.
10052690	10054091	One vote over song number one.
10055212	10056714	It was a very close cage match altogether.
10058755	10063019	Alright, we are going to get into one of our favorite segments.
10063139	10064420	I know it's one of my favorite segments.
10065081	10067483	It's the FUs of the week, boys and girls.
10067543	10072547	And Jamie, why is it that we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
10073989	10074149	Ahhhh.
10081229	10082930	Oh, this is bad.
10083010	10084690	Here is justice.
10084770	10086551	Here is punishment.
10086611	10089651	Here is... This is fucked up.
10090572	10094113	A big SQ to my immune system for being a bitch.
10095973	10099534	Um, yeah, the virus lingered.
10100115	10104956	I was feeling kinda icky-poo last week, but not as bad as I was before it was hanging on.
10105655	10133350	and then I thought my allergies were kicking in so I was like, oh great, I get over running 103 fever to, you know, having my allergies clear up then to have it settle into a cough on Friday and then having this doctor, one of the weekend doctors at Kaiser who saw me for 10 minutes said, it's the same crap he had before here, take this stuff with codeine in it and don't drive, which I have been because codeine doesn't do shit to me.
10134050	10134991	It takes a lot of it
10135529	10136310	And then I act drunk.
10136970	10137531	That's all it is.
10138231	10140033	So, F you to Dr. Huang.
10140053	10154485	F you to wanting ice cream really bad and not being able to have it because dairy products stick in mucus.
10155286	10162872	And I know it's really disgusting, but it's been to the point where I've woken up, wake up sometimes in the morning choking.
10164403	10193524	and then having major chest pains it feels like I've got asthma actually what it feels like for it feels like okay for people who are not of strong cardiovascular health try to run for a minute at five miles an hour and then the way that your chest feels that's how I feel all the time um a big F you goes to having my voice go in and out um by tomorrow I'm sure I won't have one which is good because if people try to talk to me I just go I can't talk bye um
10196196	10202918	and really, you know, a big F you to situations I can't do crap about as much as I would like to.
10205019	10213201	And then an F you to the person who was tailgating me on the way here.
10214101	10218302	I really felt like throwing all my brakes, but my car's in bad enough shape as it is.
10218782	10220263	An F you to the hot coming.
10220683	10224444	I was, you know, thinking it was pretty cool that it was all wintery and
10224932	10226973	You know, the temperature was nice outside.
10227073	10229794	And then it gets, like, warm.
10229974	10231835	It's supposed to be 74 degrees tomorrow.
10232516	10233016	Fuck that.
10233076	10234136	I want it to stay in the 50s.
10234337	10235597	I want it cold.
10235897	10237558	Because my AC doesn't work.
10239219	10239699	That's it.
10241240	10241700	Oh, yeah?
10241940	10246582	And F you to Jinpachi Mishima for being a tough-ass bastard to beat.
10248143	10248603	That's it.
10250204	10251845	Alright, let's move on to Loki.
10253306	10253666	Okay.
10253766	10254086	Okay.
10255463	10274234	First off, fuck you to the movie White Noise, because it had a really weird ending to it, and also now because of that movie, I have no chance whatsoever to actually practice anything with EVP because the fiancé now forbids it, because I'm meddling.
10275419	10276860	Aw, no more portal to hell?
10277000	10279222	And we find out what happens to people who meddle.
10279502	10285427	They get their bones broken and their entire body and then thrown off a building by three evil spirits.
10286608	10287549	Oh, gave away the end.
10287809	10288170	Damn.
10289631	10296757	Anyways, and then fuck you to the guy game.
10298064	10298364	Why?
10298684	10310671	Because the guy game, for some reason, freezes up whenever I try to do Tier 3, and now I can't progress any further and unlock any other women or see more boobies, because I'm stuck now, because it will not load Tier 3.
10311292	10313233	Goddammit, that sucks.
10314814	10318196	Did you ever think maybe that could be remedied by buying a legit copy of the game?
10318797	10319617	Oh, too bad they don't sell it.
10319817	10320998	Oh, well, damn.
10321298	10325940	No, what I'm going to do is I'm going to find a save file for it that's everything unlocked, and then I'll just build a bypass and all that.
10326480	10335444	And then also, fuck you to this woman we spoke to at the Hazelwood apartment.
10335604	10338485	She was talking to us like we were retarded.
10338906	10343828	Talking very slowly and in a southern accent.
10344408	10345889	And I just wanted to smack her.
10347808	10351489	I'm so busy right now.
10351909	10352569	Fucking hate him.
10353590	10363393	And finally, fuck you to the reanimated head of Walt Disney for eating all those stupid children.
10364113	10365133	What did they ever do to you?
10369455	10370815	Okay, I guess it's my turn.
10378485	10383528	F you to the fact that I'm so sore today because I slept on that mattress or that fold-out bed last night.
10383988	10388951	I should have just let the two guys who wanted to make out all night long sleep on the things.
10388991	10389651	They could have that.
10390011	10392653	And I should have taken the nice fluffy mattress that was on the ground.
10392673	10396435	But I was kind of stupid and I just took the first comfy thing that looked available.
10396515	10399837	But I'm very thankful to the person who let us stay there.
10399917	10401317	So I can't really bitch too much.
10401397	10402638	But F you to pain.
10402718	10403679	It hurts.
10403699	10405480	It hurts so bad.
10407570	10411672	Thank you to Drugs, because taking Tylenol helped make the pain go away.
10411752	10413913	So I'm very thankful to that.
10415574	10419036	F you to the guy wearing the shirt that said they were against gay fraternities.
10420056	10422157	What did gay fraternities ever do to you?
10422798	10428761	Did they... I don't even want to know what they... Let people do what they want.
10428941	10430501	God, get your nose out of their business.
10432462	10432863	And then...
10435430	10442895	An FU to the fact that I also want ice cream, but I'm just too lazy to go get it.
10444796	10446117	Ooh, okay, cool.
10449979	10450279	All right.
10451820	10452841	That's it for my FUs.
10453001	10459285	We'll be back with the chatroom FUs right after we get to Angel and Arcadian's FUs.
10460205	10460866	Let's start with Angel.
10462119	10469204	Thank you to myself for having this weird-ass dream last night and waking myself up three hours after I went to bed.
10469904	10474207	And then I had to, like, I don't know, calm myself back down and go back over and go to bed.
10474227	10476269	That was just fucked up.
10477289	10480412	Thank you to myself again for...
10481323	10487467	Realizing that, oh, I need to update my video drivers for Final Fantasy 7, but that's okay because I need to reinstall the damn thing anyway now.
10488688	10490670	So that kind of sucks.
10491690	10494292	Other than that, nothing else really.
10494893	10498295	I'm pretty boring as usual, and yeah, you don't need to hear me anymore.
10498335	10498735	Goodbye!
10499976	10500597	Arcadian.
10502998	10509383	Fuck you to the creeping broke crud that I've had just now going away after several weeks.
10511832	10515233	Um, let's see, uh, fuck you to Chosky being so far away.
10515253	10520275	It's just necessitating, necessitating a two-hour drive up the mountain that I did today.
10521055	10521636	Up to Reno.
10522756	10526177	Got to see some mysterious white substance that was on the ground in many places.
10527978	10532699	Uh, that was... Oh, yes, there was crack all over the ground.
10532739	10534500	Came from the sky.
10534540	10536261	Yay, crack from the sky.
10536301	10537181	It's God's crack.
10539233	10548959	and then fuck you to car lights and at night, like, blinding me and my fucking windows for always getting all crud on and blinding me and all that kind of shit.
10550099	10551040	Jamie made it funny.
10551080	10552801	Don't pay attention to her.
10553601	10556123	Are you saying that God has dermatitis of the ass?
10559144	10560385	Just don't listen.
10560825	10561786	Don't listen to us, Arcadian.
10561806	10562166	I'm sorry.
10564584	10565365	Yeah, that's all.
10565885	10566266	Alright.
10567587	10568407	One more real quick.
10569088	10571970	Fuck you to Explicit for not picking up his DS.
10572230	10575773	We do have a policy that if it's not picked up within a month, it becomes ours.
10577074	10577494	So hurry up.
10577995	10582679	Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs because I know a lot of you guys have some rants tonight.
10586201	10590184	Dark Knight would like Jamie to know that Jim Pocci is a hard-ass bastard.
10590605	10591325	He agrees with you there.
10591726	10592446	Fuck yeah.
10592807	10593267	I hate him.
10593737	10596898	Dark Knight also says... That's not a nice thing to say to Dark Knight.
10596998	10597978	Dark Knight's a nice guy.
10598038	10599319	No, I like Dark Knight.
10599679	10600699	Dark Knight's my buddy.
10601179	10607901	I'm talking about Jinpachi with his... Well, you know why the mouth is in his... It's his cheap-ass fireball, isn't it?
10607921	10608341	I fucking hate that.
10608361	10609642	You know why the mouth is on his stomach?
10610522	10611602	His mouth is on his stomach.
10611642	10613483	Because your soul is stored in your belly.
10615521	10617282	I've got a lot of soul in me, then.
10617562	10619064	Remember Bishamon and Darkstalkers.
10619304	10619964	He was like that, too.
10620084	10622266	I need to lose some soul, if that's the case.
10622926	10626048	But he's possessed, so the possession is on his tummy.
10627109	10628770	Like Bishamon and Darkstalkers.
10628810	10633033	Sure, he just didn't have, like, a really bad taco or anything, and, like, Taco Bell.
10633113	10635595	Sometimes my stomach feels like that after a night at Taco Bell.
10637977	10638877	He ate it, gym boys.
10639057	10641179	It's like my stomach suddenly becomes the grudge.
10645499	10650420	Dark Knight says, F you to the many evil corporations in the US that treat its employees like shit.
10651060	10652100	Quote the Raven, nevermore.
10654621	10658542	Dork says, F you to this damn bitch at work for saying she'll get me fired.
10658902	10660902	One, I could give a shit if I lose this job or not.
10660982	10664103	And two, why the fuck are you going to complain to my boss about me telling you the truth?
10664563	10666704	If you can't handle the truth, don't fucking ask.
10667184	10668224	And again, F you to girls.
10670524	10671865	Yeah, well, F you back, buddy.
10673285	10673665	I'm kidding.
10674275	10677558	AseanBuddy Paul says, F you to my Spanish 3 class.
10677938	10683323	If I do any more Spanish, I'll no longer be allowed to check the Asian Pacific Islander box on applications.
10686386	10689628	Vandalist says, F you to California's real estate prices.
10689809	10690509	Oh, God, yes.
10690870	10695033	And F you to Nashville for showing me that a lavish house and acreage doesn't have to cost over 700K.
10695073	10695393	I feel sad.
10700764	10712373	BigSuperSSJ100FU to Destination TV for screwing me out of an internship and trying to use me to steal equipment from my film school and using me for slave labor.
10713134	10720280	FU to MesaGolfland Beatmania2DX players and Danbury Connecticut DDR players for being hissy fit people who don't like people lesser than them.
10721982	10723703	That's quite a big scope of the country there.
10724488	10735522	Sephiroth 1215 says, F you to the stupid people who think they are so good at DDR because they can do 1.10 even though all they can play on 1.5 and they won't let anyone they don't know play.
10739106	10742851	You know, if you can beat Bag on 3 speed, that's really only like a 9, that's not a 10.
10745819	10749266	DJ Ranma S says, F you to people who don't know how to use iPods.
10750729	10754837	RTFM, read the fucking manual first before you return the pod, you ass.
10755433	10759415	and FU to Best Buy for not giving recognition to us grunts in the Geek Squad.
10759795	10762516	We fix computers, check TVs, and do customer service.
10762877	10764037	We want some props too.
10764357	10764497	Ugh.
10765138	10770820	You know, I saw... Actually, I was driving down the road the other day and I saw one of those Geek Squad cars and that just made me laugh.
10770880	10772881	I'm like, that's such a sitcom waiting to happen.
10773342	10776103	Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do Geek Squad!
10776123	10780565	You know what's sad enough is I'd be doing that if I was actually accredited.
10784227	10784347	Um...
10787617	10791240	Okay, I think I only got like half of IllusionsFU because it starts like this.
10791720	10794183	My friend and I go to IHOP anyway, half an hour late.
10794243	10795083	My friend isn't there.
10795484	10799047	I call my friend and he says that my friend Esteban would be coming back to IHOP.
10799067	10800668	So we just eat at IHOP and wait for him.
10801109	10804050	We eat our meals and after the meal my coupon doesn't work.
10804090	10806492	The coupon gave me a free meal because I bought appetizers.
10806952	10809373	I didn't bring that much money so I'm totally scrounging for change.
10809453	10810473	There goes most of my money.
10810934	10816676	We walk to Shakey's and this crazy guy comes off the freeway, scares us and we run for our lives as he chases after us.
10817277	10826401	We get to Shakey's and after all that crap I find that they had just taken the DDR machine out and my friend had waited around for us an hour and a half thus making it the worst weekend ever.
10830816	10832978	Wait till you get a job and work full time.
10834339	10835900	Then every weekend's the worst weekend ever.
10835920	10837041	No, I'm kidding.
10837381	10839803	RPGKing7 says, F you to being unemployed.
10839843	10844307	It really sucks and I've tried everywhere in my town and the next two towns over and no jobs.
10845108	10846068	Unemployment sucks.
10848590	10851573	John Field says, F you to my grandfather dying, crying.
10851753	10854595	F you to my laziness this week when I have a paper due this Tuesday.
10855136	10856797	That grandfather F you goes to cancer.
10856937	10857838	Sorry to hear about it, bud.
10858118	10860280	Hope things are okay.
10861260	10861640	And that's it.
10861660	10862521	That was the last FU.
10864622	10868524	Thank you to the chat room for playing along with the FUs of the week.
10869144	10869725	That's always fun.
10870485	10875708	Alright, we're going to do a quick two-song break, then we're going to come back to wrap stuff up here on Orange Lounge Radio.
10876188	10883372	In this break, I'm liking the Ultramix 2 thing, so we're going to do a song from Ultramix 2, and then maybe an older one from Ultramix 1.
10883432	10883972	How's that sound?
10884673	10886614	So we will be back after this.
10888875	10890456	I just have to figure out what song we're going to do first.
10894975	10900640	When we come back, we're going to wrap it up, tell you guys what to look forward to next week, and all that fun stuff.
10901561	10905145	However, I have to be able to successfully navigate my computer before we can get to a break.
10906286	10908788	I'm a folder challenge tonight, apparently.
10909569	10910770	Rob loses at the computer.
10910890	10913252	I totally lose.
10913813	10916255	Let's do a Max Remix, because we haven't done one of those in a while.
10917056	10917897	We'll be back after this.
11001668	11002109	and many more.
11064864	11068787	Do you ever question your life?
11068827	11070608	Do you ever wonder why?
11071528	11074530	Do you ever see in your dreams?
11074550	11076211	Oh, can you see in the sky?
11076311	11077032	Oh, tell me why
11137961	11142805	From Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!
11142885	11143326	Holla!
11143366	11143606	P-T-P-O!
11152366	11153246	Thank you for watching!
11180217	11185099	RekkaCon, I'm going to try and make it out there if I can, because I do want to support that.
11185199	11186619	So we'll be out there, hopefully.
11187580	11189440	That happens in, what, two weeks, Angel?
11189460	11189760	Two weeks.
11190240	11191221	So I'm going to try and be out there.
11192761	11194822	I'll cosplay if I can get a purple wig and duct tape.
11195142	11196382	What are you going to cosplay as?
11198183	11199584	I need a purple wig and duct tape.
11199644	11202004	I want to cosplay as something, but it has to be easy.
11202044	11206786	I want to cosplay, if I were to cosplay at all, Dr. Cube.
11207871	11208891	Oh, that would rock.
11208911	11210292	That would so rock.
11211012	11211332	Maybe.
11211432	11213033	I actually found my Jill costume.
11213753	11220195	But one of my costumes is now retired because it is four sizes too big.
11221896	11222176	Wow.
11222196	11224177	Well, hey, that's the best reason to retire something.
11225037	11226638	Although I do still have my Emmy costume.
11226938	11227318	There you go.
11227558	11228258	I have the wig.
11228298	11228938	I have everything.
11228958	11230719	I should cosplay as Pantsless Rage.
11231226	11236649	You know, I just, I had a vest for a Rage costume and I just threw it out.
11237209	11238150	Oh, that's all right.
11238310	11238810	It wouldn't fit you.
11240591	11240831	Oh, well.
11241892	11245594	Anyway, so we got that coming up in future weeks on the show.
11245654	11248535	Don't forget to check out our podcast, www.orange.com.
11248555	11249216	Click on podcast.
11249256	11252017	It's us talking about other types of games, not just the Bomani games.
11252337	11252898	It's pretty cool.
11253398	11260642	And what's very interesting is that we thought we were going to be famous because we actually got contacted by a reporter for a pretty big newspaper in the area.
11261127	11262549	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
11276340	11276640	Oh, well.
11277161	11278341	So keep supporting our podcast.
11278381	11279782	Our podcast has been doing very well.
11279802	11280783	We're very happy about that.
11280843	11283305	So that's going to continue to grow and just be something else here at Orange Lounge.
11283325	11287107	I wanted to go to, like, PhantomCon, but it's so close to E3.
11287127	11296673	It's like, I think that, like, you know, previous, you know, two years ago was like the last time that I've gone, and I think that's probably the last time I will go.
11296813	11297994	I still want to go pretty bad, too.
11298034	11299315	I found my photos from front of me.
11299415	11301216	Even though E3 is right there, I still want to go.
11301236	11305319	The only reason that I go to those things anymore is just Studio Sudoku.
11305339	11305459	Okay.
11306179	11312282	I fucking love ReDeath and Fanboy Bebop and Nescaflonate.
11312702	11314963	That is the reason why I go to Fanime right there.
11315844	11318745	So, it'll be fun.
11319326	11334673	And besides, the dealer's room calls to me and it calls to my wallet and it, you know, I buy Gundam models there every time and I still have three that I haven't built yet and I really, you know, I can't afford it.
11336235	11338136	Alright, we gotta wrap it up, guys.
11338196	11341639	It's time to go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Angel.
11342479	11344600	Damn this level on WarioWare Touched.
11344741	11345341	Final Fantasy?
11345381	11346982	Wait, what the hell was I trying to say there?
11347382	11348363	Addict, Arcadian.
11349544	11349984	Final thought.
11350004	11352786	It's good to see the mountains again.
11354067	11354767	Loki, your final thought.
11357416	11362218	and Goddammit, that bag of gummy bears is going to be gone pretty soon.
11363478	11366059	My final thought is, mmm, gummy bears.
11367200	11367780	DarkSakura.
11368700	11369701	Rob.
11369821	11370021	What?
11371381	11378103	And remember, folks, you ever heard of a joke getting old?
11378564	11378764	No.
11380104	11381104	Really, Rob?
11382565	11384186	There's another thing I've got to point out to everyone.
11384226	11385286	This is very important.
11385649	11386910	Peeps are now on sale.
11386990	11389170	Go to your local grocery store and buy them.
11389190	11393472	It is peep season, and remember, we here at Orange Lounge Radio endorse the peep jousting.
