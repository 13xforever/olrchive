482	3744	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 28th, 2005.
4305	15913	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16353	20556	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21997	31599	Hello everybody, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast which you've subscribed to where we talk about video games that don't suck.
32500	35340	And well, sadly some that do because they just sneak in there.
35420	39822	But I think tonight we got a lot of games to talk about that don't suck.
40322	44563	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky, I'll be helping you make your way through this show.
44643	49524	Joining me as always, the lovely DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
50319	51079	Hi!
51599	52919	The perky Jamie Summers.
53440	54200	I'm just faking it.
54480	54820	Oh, okay.
55520	56480	Angsty as always, huh?
58160	58601	Always.
58961	59241	Alright.
59661	61441	Also, say hello to Loki.
61821	62361	Hello.
63141	65742	And how's that DS charger you've been working on?
65782	67402	You were working on it during the three hour show.
67842	70603	I'm on step six of twelve.
70783	71363	Alright.
71423	75143	For those that don't know, he's building a DS charger out of Legos.
75824	77744	Now, explain how this works, Loki.
78425	93257	Basically, it's got the charging cord built into it, and you just set the charger down, or set the DS down on the charger like a, you know, a dock, and there you go, and it holds like, well, six games and three styluses.
94057	96539	Huh, and this is all something you found on a website?
96959	98441	Yeah, I browse a lot of forums.
98561	99581	God bless the internet.
100562	105426	Alright, I like this idea of making your own cases out of Legos, it's a brilliant concept.
106451	110394	Alright, let's get into what's going on in our own personal gaming world this week.
110434	114036	Of course, the PSP launched this past week.
114616	119619	I know somebody in here has got to have had to put their hands on one at some point, and I know it was probably DarkSakura.
119900	120380	Am I right?
124623	124923	Maybe.
126204	127064	Your voice is cracking.
128025	129346	What has been going on in your gaming world?
129946	131047	Silent Hill 3.
131427	132007	Lots of it.
132207	132788	Not the PSP?
133846	138931	and no, because somebody else has been playing his new limb.
140952	143374	Someone who will not be named Dan.
143875	144195	I'm sorry.
144795	146277	Oh, or not named fianc√©.
146357	146517	Yeah.
147458	148499	Or hetero life partner.
151501	151821	All right.
153523	155965	So you haven't really had a chance to play the PSP at all?
157366	157847	I played it.
157867	158727	I played Darkstalkers.
158827	159388	What did you think of it?
159873	160713	It was Darkstalkers.
161153	161934	It was actually really cool.
161954	162894	What do you think of the PSP?
162934	164135	I'm really curious your thoughts.
164275	165495	It's really awesome.
165675	174078	It has the little LED HD screen thingy and plays movies and MP3s and screw the iPod.
174938	176679	Hey, I still like my iPod.
177219	179520	Yeah, but see where you paid $400 for your iPod?
179580	179960	I paid $300.
180000	182801	We paid $250 for the... Whatever.
183121	183241	Okay.
183261	183301	Um...
192351	194132	DarkSakura is your favorite out of the five?
194892	198715	It's the only one I've played, but I really, really, really, really, really like Ridge Racer.
199716	201778	It's pretty, and it has Reiko in it, so it's all good.
202318	202598	Cool.
203699	205340	Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
207762	209664	I played Final Fantasy XI for ten minutes.
209684	211345	You're cutting back, huh?
212917	215278	I have a Final Fantasy XI story tonight.
215318	215979	It's pretty interesting.
216079	216859	We'll get to it in a minute.
216879	220382	But first, Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world besides the DS Charger?
221462	224464	I've been playing a ton of games, actually.
224685	229208	I bought God of War, which I've been playing a lot of that.
229668	230589	It's really awesome.
230609	233150	They're calling that the Ninja Gaiden of PS2.
233471	234151	What do you think?
234211	236173	No, it's very, very similar to...
238959	240240	Devil May Cry 3 Devil May Cry 3
267958	273782	It basically looks like Lord of the Rings, you know, where you have him, he's just like tossing armies in the air and just like stuff like that.
273902	278625	And there's fireballs and crap that he's throwing, hitting like buildings nearby you and stuff and you're running.
278985	287150	There's another part where you have to go to the Temple of Pandora, which is on the back of a titan, a giant like, you know, monster type thing.
287574	293355	And as you're climbing around the castle, they'll show scenes where you can see the titans walking and everything.
293855	295416	Just tons of detail.
295436	297856	And, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's nudity in this game.
297916	301237	There is full frontal nudity, and there's a sex minigame.
301417	301817	Awesome!
302297	303218	So you gotta love that.
303798	306278	And then it's violent and bloody as hell.
306979	308139	And it's really cool, they've got these...
309480	310541	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
327847	328688	Wow, alright.
328788	332451	So, definitely, highly recommend, you know, going out and getting that game.
332471	332911	It's awesome.
333332	338096	The other game I got was, um, TimeSplitter 3 because I just love the TimeSplitter series.
338376	343380	I love how they have, they have actually gotten really good with it because the first game's story mode sucked.
343440	344641	Second game, it was pretty good.
344762	347564	Third game, story mode's pretty good, actually.
347704	351307	And, um, they've got a lot of stuff that's, um, been added to it.
351347	354430	Just a lot of, like, you know, um...
356030	357931	A lot of different elements into it.
357951	360331	150 playable characters that you can unlock through the entire game.
360811	368573	And like TimeSplitters, the other games, they have a challenge mode where you play these mini-games that are really off-the-wall strange.
369014	376896	Anything from survival in a haunted house thing to shooting off heads, breaking windows, driving a cat, and playing hoops.
377656	378336	Driving a cat?
378396	379056	Driving a cat.
379216	379596	Okay.
379716	380777	It's a cat with wheels on it.
380897	381357	I don't know.
381597	382497	It's just driving a cat.
382937	383818	Cat racing game.
384038	385498	I don't get it, but that's what it is.
386321	390923	They've got, supposedly, there's a thing that hints a Tony Hawk type game that's in there.
391743	395044	Just like it's so immersive and there's so many characters you can play.
395064	402427	Of course, one of the things that sets Time Sleuthers apart from other games is the ability to make your own deathmatch maps.
403087	405128	Really good system that's only gotten better.
405648	412391	Online gameplay for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube probably not, but online gameplay for those.
412984	438868	and so that'll be pretty interesting and um just like I said the story mode's awesome it's very very well done like the graphics and everything a lot of fun actually all right and then of course you know the other two games I had of course were the ones I mentioned last week Gran Turismo 4 which I haven't really played much of and then Dog's Life which I must say that this dog is wandering through a world of the most lazy people I've ever seen
439261	457272	That want this dog to like perform miracles for them And I'm like, god damn it This girl's like, I want you to build me a snowman I'm like, it's a fucking dog It doesn't do snowmen, what the hell So I threw poop at her Okay, that's a dog wood So have you played any games you don't like lately?
457312	466478	It seems like you're really enjoying all these games Um No I really did like God of War and stuff And um
467742	470564	Burnout 3 or something, you know, that'd be pretty cool.
497046	498527	But I still like it.
498727	502450	I just have to get into it and play it some more and I'll love it again.
502831	503271	Sounds good.
504011	506333	In my gaming world, not a whole lot new.
506453	511177	I've still been playing Zelda Minish Cap and I'm almost done with it, but that's pretty much been taking a lot of my time.
511557	516461	However, I did get to get my grubby little paws on the PSP that Dan has.
516981	524286	For about seven minutes or so, I got to play either... Now, there's a little controversy over how this game is pronounced.
524326	525968	It's either Lumines or Luminous.
526708	531031	and I guess Luminous is probably the more proper one, but a lot of you have probably been calling this game Luminous.
531291	534553	I got to play this game for about seven minutes, loved every minute of it.
534753	536834	Oh my gosh, that game is hot, I really want a PSP.
538456	539176	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
568345	570386	Alright, let's get into some gaming news going on.
570406	574748	We'll start it off with the PSP, since of course there's a lot of stuff going on with the PSP.
574908	579129	One of them being the dead pixels going on with the PSPs.
579169	586332	You've probably heard of this, maybe this happened to one of your friends, but a lot of these PSPs apparently have dead pixels, or do they?
586832	589814	Sony is responding to the reports going on right now.
591835	593856	It's commonly referred to as a defect.
594016	599159	However, Sony is saying that this is a problem that actually happens in all LCD screens.
599619	607483	Says Sony, a very small number of dark pixels or continuously lit pixels is normal for LCD screens and is not a sign of malfunction.
608982	611343	Page 13 of the PSP manual says this.
611823	617146	Red, blue, or green spots or black spots may appear in certain locations on the LCD screen.
617546	623709	The appearance of such spots is a normal occurrence associated with LCD screens and not a sign of malfunction.
624784	626465	So what should you do if this is happening to you?
627326	638775	They're suggesting that you try this out for a week or two, but if it continues to bother you, then you can use your one-year warranty that comes with the PSP.
639216	642519	All the details are on page 125 of the manual.
642559	643259	You know what's funny?
643379	643559	Huh?
644560	649048	I swear, I've got this game system called the DS that has two LCD screens.
649349	649789	And guess what?
649849	650811	It doesn't happen there.
651031	652073	Why does it happen on yours?
652113	654618	Okay, but you know what's weird is I have heard of it happening on the DS.
654678	655519	Maybe it's not happening on yours.
655559	656401	But here's the thing, though.
657351	662137	But it's not a common thing because I have a LCD screen at work.
662678	663419	I can tell you this much.
663679	665341	I've had it on for a long time.
665361	667483	It doesn't have any dead pixels in there.
667503	669266	My DS doesn't have any dead pixels in it.
669646	671769	My Game Boy Advance didn't have any dead pixels in it.
672089	674372	Why does your PSPs have a lot of dead pixels in it?
674472	675933	Because you're using chip.
676650	678131	It happens with HDTVs all the time.
678151	678251	So, I...
697319	710666	The advice I heard, and we were talking about this on the three hour program, Dan the man was here talking about the PSP, try putting in the movie that most of you guys got with your PSP, put in Spider-Man and try watching it and see if that unfreezes the pixel.
711407	712668	Just try different tricks like that.
713488	715509	Try doing something a little different and maybe it'll help.
715909	720472	So hopefully we saved you some headache there if you're one of those folks that has the PSP or the dead pixel.
720972	723714	I hope when I get mine though I never have this problem because that will make me sad.
725692	729033	Speaking of the PSP, very interesting.
729113	734014	Some folks are using Wipeout Pure to be browsing the internet.
735494	737615	Loki, I know you love reading about the hack stuff.
737655	738435	What's going on with this?
738815	739975	They're using the Wipeout.
739995	742656	I guess there's a function in the game where you can actually view the website.
742776	745357	I don't think the website's up right now or something.
745757	750038	And so people are actually using it as a proxy or a way to bounce off of it to...
751030	757055	Visit other websites such as Slashdot and Hackaday where I'm guessing this probably was featured in an article.
759057	761478	I actually found the link from Slashdot, but, you know.
762079	764741	Well, Slashdot steals from Hackaday all the time.
765342	768344	Because people that read Slashdot read Hackaday and yadda yadda yadda.
769008	769848	Very interesting.
771029	772609	Not everything works, though.
772669	775690	Some things don't work, like JavaScript, frames.
775770	778131	Of course, you can't expect all that kind of stuff to work.
778751	786453	But apparently, you can actually use Google, because you can use the X button on the PSP, and it brings up a little keyboard, so you can use that to type in things.
787734	788915	Very interesting there.
789435	791717	But here's what you need to be doing on there.
792137	795659	Looking up internet porn.
795960	799062	See, now that would be cool if you can download stuff to the DS.
799782	803445	Just infect your PSP with a Bonzi buddy.
804125	805506	Oh my god, that would be hilarious.
805526	809569	Wait for your PSP to get spyware.
809649	812551	How many days did it take them to install Linux on the PSP?
812631	813592	I don't think they've done it yet.
813812	815233	Oh my gosh, it's a miracle.
815407	817228	Hey, it's only coming, I mean, it takes a while.
817488	818329	You know, like a couple days.
818909	819409	Well, we'll see.
820190	826433	Alright, if you want more information on how to use Wipeout Pure's hidden web browser, head on over to this website.
826473	839420	It's www.fumanchu.com slash p-s-p-d-e-v They'll have all the information there on that.
839500	841061	Hopefully that website doesn't get crashed.
841381	844243	Hopefully it stays up there, but it's probably going to get hit with a lot of folks.
845971	846096	Um...
846895	853300	Also, going on in the PlayStation world, now this is a pretty big story, but we don't have a lot of information at this time.
853340	856682	This was actually another article that was on Slashdot.
857723	861185	But they're saying that according to Japan Today, the U.S.
861245	865749	District Court in Oakland, California has ordered Sony and its U.S.
865909	870792	unit to pay $90.7 million in damages to Immersion Corp.
871093	875656	for patent infringement over controllers used with PlayStation game consoles.
876116	892181	In the ruling, which was handed down Thursday, the federal court also ordered Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment America to stop selling the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles using DualShock controllers as well as more than 40 game software products.
892461	895282	Very interesting if this is actually coming to light.
895682	897002	I mean, there could be a stay.
897302	897762	We don't know.
897802	901063	This is all kind of developing right now, so we don't know.
901203	903324	This will certainly be something we hear about more this week.
904264	908486	But my first thought is, those PlayStation controllers have been around for like 10 years.
908926	911027	It's just now coming to be a patent issue?
911067	911747	What's going on with that?
911807	914248	Is that really how slow our legal system is, or what?
914468	916869	I think patents are 15 years.
916889	918610	I guess.
918630	919650	Expiration on them.
920390	922131	But still, what is going on with that?
923431	924332	Do you think this is going to hold?
924492	926653	Do you think they're actually going to have to stop selling PlayStation?
926693	928373	It's Sony, no.
928954	932495	But... You never know.
932984	934885	They just need to work it out.
934905	935705	Yeah, there's always appeals.
935725	936865	They need to work it out.
963574	967017	I'd be kind of curious of why they waited so long, to be honest.
967797	971700	We have some various online, multiplayer online news.
971740	972841	We have three of them.
973061	975443	I promised we would do a story about Final Fantasy XI.
975463	976503	This is kind of interesting.
976864	984129	This is only going to apply to the Japanese version of Final Fantasy XI, but they're going to be doing a campaign called the Welcome Back Campaign.
984389	989873	It's going to be going on from April 14th to July 13th, and if you are a retired Final Fantasy XI player,
990593	1002297	Sign up on the game's official site and you can get your play online and Final Fantasy registration codes reissued by Squeenix, meaning that you can return to the game with your old characters intact.
1003197	1005798	And you'll be able to play the game free for 30 days!
1007290	1011734	So they're trying to sucker you back into the addicting world of Final Fantasy XI.
1012335	1020283	I know all you guys are currently in Final Fantasy XI, but let's say they reinstated this type of similar thing in a game that you've maybe left, like...
1021192	1023553	DarkSakura for you may be Ragnarok or PSO?
1023633	1024473	Is this something you'd jump on?
1024573	1030635	They've given free months, and I hadn't ever re-registered.
1031196	1032656	Do you think that's the main reason why they do this?
1032836	1037318	On Ragnarok Online, if you were in the second beta, you'd keep your character forever.
1037338	1037938	Oh, cool.
1038298	1043520	So I could go a year from now if I wanted to play RO again, and my character would still be there at her same levels.
1043860	1044140	Oh, cool.
1045201	1045341	So...
1046556	1050418	Do you think this is just something they're doing to sucker people back into it and get obsessed with Final Fantasy again?
1050558	1050759	Yes.
1051699	1052740	Probably good business sense.
1053040	1053660	Loki, what about you?
1053680	1054421	What do you think of the idea?
1054441	1057703	Because you're somebody who's still paying for Final Fantasy XI.
1057723	1061265	Are you a little ticked off that somebody else is going to get 30 free days just because they quit?
1061465	1061865	Whatever.
1062025	1062366	Who cares?
1064127	1064647	I really don't.
1065267	1066448	I mean, so what?
1066468	1067208	They get it for free.
1067368	1073291	I mean, that's just like, you know, all those cable companies out there that, you know, hey, you get the movie channels for free if you, you know, join us.
1073551	1076313	Then people are like, ah, why are they doing that?
1076433	1081195	So there's actually retarded people out there that will actually quit and come back to get the free movie channels.
1081536	1082376	I'm like, you're an idiot.
1082476	1088739	But whatever, you know, hey, try to get them back because, you know, they've got competition now with World of Warcraft and stuff.
1088839	1090000	So good luck.
1090160	1091621	But I don't think it's going to work.
1092103	1098747	Speaking of World of Warcraft, this week World of Warcraft was patched to version 1.3.0.
1099387	1108452	And what they've added, like chat bubbles, brand new chat bubbles, quest trackers, and a brand new dungeon, which is called Dire Maul.
1108552	1112454	Now I know that nobody here is that into World of Warcraft, but it's kind of neat.
1113074	1114695	I know it's a very insanely popular game.
1114735	1122079	It is a game I still want to check out as soon as I officially part from Final Fantasy XI, because technically I'm still on it, but not much longer.
1122119	1124580	I do want to check out at least World of Warcraft, give it a chance.
1125181	1134486	But I know it's insanely popular, so I'm sure this download, which is going to be 62 megabytes of a chat, a lot of folks are going to be really happy about this one.
1135106	1140749	They're saying that the chat bubbles are kind of like what you see in EverQuest 2, which should be very interesting.
1140849	1140969	Hmm.
1142013	1148095	The new area, by the way, the new dungeon, it's kind of interesting because it seems like whenever they put in new areas in a game, it's always for high levels.
1148575	1153397	Yeah, you're going to have to be level 56 to 60 if you want to get to this new area, Dire Maul.
1155557	1161139	Also going on in other online RPGs, the Matrix Online finally started.
1162039	1163720	So it just launched this week.
1163780	1170242	Of course, we were talking on the last podcast about when the Matrix Online stopped its beta, did that pretty hilarious sign-off.
1171317	1173699	Now, tell me, Loki, I don't know how much you've heard about this.
1173719	1175440	You've been following Matrix Online more than I have.
1176040	1176581	Is it true?
1176761	1182024	I thought I was reading something where they've actually hired people to be actors in the Matrix Online.
1182124	1182285	Yep.
1182485	1186527	That is their job, to play this game and move the story.
1186968	1192892	Yeah, they're hired to play the main characters like Niobe, Morpheus, etc., etc., and they're hired to do that.
1194393	1194633	Wow.
1194653	1194713	Wow.
1194909	1195810	They need to hire me.
1196130	1196690	I know, seriously.
1196710	1203915	I mean, this just makes me think, my gosh, now kids everywhere will be able to tell their parents, see, you can make a living playing video games.
1204835	1206877	I mean, wow.
1207037	1209278	We'll also just ask any game tester, but still.
1211279	1215802	Still, though, there's a difference between game testing and then actually immersing yourself in this world.
1215862	1216363	I mean, really.
1217463	1223287	I would love to do that, you know, but I don't think that after a while it would get kind of old.
1224549	1228092	I wonder if they switch characters once in a while, liven it up, or how they do that.
1228153	1228773	That's kind of weird.
1228813	1231777	I wonder if they're always on 24 hours a day, or what they do.
1232337	1233478	If they switch, I don't know.
1233639	1234720	It'd be cool just playing Neo.
1236141	1239024	Well, apparently they do have Neo running around in there somewhere.
1239225	1239925	I don't think so.
1239965	1240266	He's dead.
1241472	1242612	Oh, I thought he was in there somewhere.
1242773	1244573	They said that he's spotted.
1244593	1245453	That's just a myth.
1246134	1248394	Well, you know, how could they not?
1248494	1249335	Dead or not?
1249635	1251576	I mean, you know, Freddy's died how many times?
1251596	1254376	We'll bring him back and then we'll do a fucking trilogy again.
1254617	1255397	Yeah, exactly.
1257317	1257918	So, yeah.
1258358	1270702	Now, this last bit of MMORPG news I have isn't quite exactly about the game itself, but the ramifications that getting really into an MMO can have.
1272108	1280295	Sony Online Entertainment just sent some notice that there has been a baby named after a character in EverQuest.
1281376	1292204	Player Tabitha Ayers gave birth to a baby girl on January 6, 2005 and promptly named her Firiona Valle Ayers.
1292504	1297188	And these people right here should have their membership cancelled and they should be castrated.
1297468	1301652	In honor of EverQuest's famous spokes-elf, um...
1302128	1302869	Very interesting.
1304410	1306972	Named after an MMORPG character.
1306993	1307093	Loser.
1307233	1307673	What do you think?
1310155	1314199	But I mean, they named babies after rock stars and movie characters.
1314279	1316461	And all those people should be castrated just as well.
1316701	1317823	And video game characters.
1320485	1323908	There was someone that Dan knew that named their kid Melina.
1324509	1324969	Melina?
1325390	1325770	Melina?
1326224	1331327	I actually like the name Melina, but if I were to name my kid Melina, I wouldn't name it because of Mortal Kombat.
1331347	1335088	We decided that we're naming our first kid Richter.
1336709	1339651	So is this necessarily worse than that?
1339991	1340231	No.
1341311	1342972	Although EverQuest is really stupid.
1343993	1346474	I think this kid's going to get teased.
1346914	1353037	This person should have named their kid after a cool game instead of proving to the universe that they're an addict.
1353057	1354278	Sorry.
1354338	1354618	Sorry.
1355416	1361200	I might name... I always thought Strider was a good name for a guy, but not necessarily the same way.
1361220	1362601	It's not really a name, it's a job.
1363742	1365043	But it's also a name.
1365083	1366123	I knew kids named that.
1366664	1368505	If you change the spelling, alter it a little bit.
1370466	1371107	Alright, anyway.
1372227	1376710	Kind of an interesting story there that now kids are getting named after MMOs.
1376750	1382194	But hey, if they name kids after rock stars in movies, I guess that's just a logical progression.
1383055	1383375	Alright.
1384121	1386303	DarkSakura, what did you pick to discuss tonight with our listeners?
1386323	1387844	This is how to escape from a bad date.
1387924	1388604	Now this is necessary.
1388624	1389104	This is good.
1389124	1389805	How do you do this?
1389845	1389965	Okay.
1414113	1415434	You can fake an emergency.
1416534	1417855	Excuse yourself from the table.
1417935	1420516	Tell your date that you are going to the restroom to wash up.
1420936	1421956	Take your cell phone with you.
1422256	1425598	If you do not have one, locate a restaurant phone that's out of your date's line of vision.
1426418	1430560	Bring a restaurant matchbook or a business card that has a restaurant's phone number.
1431060	1432581	Call a friend or relative for help.
1432821	1435682	Tell them to call you, either on your cell phone or on the restaurant's phone.
1436127	1437709	and pretend there has been an emergency.
1437789	1443434	Believable emergencies are personal crisis, my friend just broke up with her husband, she's having a breakdown, I have to go.
1444135	1450821	Business crisis, my boss just called, she's in Seattle for a major presentation and has lost all of her files, I have to email them to her immediately.
1451542	1455025	Health crisis, my sister just called, our grandmother is alone and ill.
1456863	1458664	Leave quickly before your date can protest.
1458784	1462307	Apologize but refuse any attempt your date makes to accompany you.
1462747	1468411	If you leave swiftly and without hesitation, your date won't have time to understand what's happening or to object.
1468931	1470192	And then you slip away unnoticed.
1471173	1471653	Number 1.
1472193	1473855	Identify your escape route.
1474575	1475576	Observe your surroundings.
1475656	1480119	Take note of the exits, especially the back doors, for the best way out or an alternative.
1481054	1482614	2.
1481354	1482614	Plan to alter your appearance.
1482934	1486335	Think about your most distinctive features and figure out how to hide or disguise them.
1486875	1490096	The person you are trying to leave is going to see a figure moving past and away at a distance.
1490456	1492076	Only be focusing on that first impression.
1492637	1496637	If you are not familiar to him and are uninteresting, you will not get a second look.
1497618	1496637	3.
1497738	1498858	Excuse yourself from the table.
1498918	1502479	Move to the restroom or any private area with a mirror to begin your transformation.
1502959	1507980	Your date will probably wait 2 or 3 minutes before expecting you to return, so act quickly before he begins looking for you.
1509313	1510854	4.
1509793	1510854	Add or remove clothing.
1511274	1514256	Layering garments will change your body shape and even suggest a different gender.
1514917	1516578	A long coat will obscure your body type.
1517558	1521401	So if you're a guy and you want to scare your date off, come back to the table wearing a dress.
1523342	1526604	Hats are especially useful because they conceal your hair or facial features.
1526784	1529786	Eyeglasses, whether added or removed, work wonders.
1530566	1533568	A shopping bag as hand is a handy prop and can be used to hold your belongings.
1536230	1537570	5.
1536310	1537570	Change your walk and posture.
1538031	1540951	If you walk quickly and move slowly, you can stand up straight and hunch over.
1542232	1540951	6.
1543212	1544312	Use or remove cosmetics.
1544412	1545573	Blah, blah, blah.
1545593	1545573	7.
1545633	1546833	Change your hairstyle or color.
1547153	1549374	Rubber band, hairspray, water, gooey substance.
1549594	1550114	That will help.
1551254	1550114	8.
1551714	1552735	Adopt a cover roll.
1553135	1555496	A waiter in the restaurant may have an apron and be carrying a tray.
1555556	1562958	If you can manage to procure these items, add or subtract a pair of eyeglasses and alter your hairline or hairstyle, you will become invisible by moving out of the restaurant.
1562978	1564118	And put on a fake mustache.
1564574	1565495	Make your move.
1565595	1566775	Do not look at your date.
1568076	1569297	You can climb out of a window.
1569957	1574680	You can use things to break the window, such as a wastebasket, toilet plunger, handbag, or briefcase.
1575120	1576861	You can even use a paper towel dispenser.
1577662	1579103	You have to hit it in the center, though.
1579923	1582105	Or, false fails, get your date to leave.
1582705	1583646	Say something offensive.
1583806	1584846	Behave inappropriately.
1585227	1587028	Send your date on a fool's errand.
1587968	1594112	Tell him you want to go to a specific nightclub, but explain that it's very crowded and so he cannot go in after you.
1595779	1599122	But my advice in the end, don't go out with a loser.
1600063	1600483	Thank you.
1604147	1605788	Also in gaming news this week.
1606108	1610252	Actually, if I may say so, there was one on here for how to determine the gender of your date.
1611854	1614296	We'll have to save that for a future advice column.
1615397	1619681	Soul Calibur 3 is coming out, but it ain't coming out in the arcade.
1620686	1623988	And even though Link was so cool on the GameCube, it ain't coming out on the GameCube.
1624028	1628432	It is a PlayStation 2 exclusive title, Soul Calibur 3.
1629352	1630513	Namco has announced it.
1630553	1632094	It'll come out later this year.
1632695	1635877	So far, they've only announced three new characters.
1637338	1640660	And I'm going to totally butcher the pronunciations of his name, so just deal with it.
1640981	1641361	Tira...
1642108	1644829	Setsuka, and Zasamel.
1645610	1646930	There's too many letters in that one.
1647631	1650212	Two returning characters will be coming back for sure as well.
1650712	1653233	Mitsurugi and Taki.
1653473	1653994	Mitsurugi.
1654734	1656035	Sorry, I didn't play a lot of Soul Calibur.
1656175	1656955	I always played Ivy.
1657015	1658396	I like the easy to pronounce names.
1659936	1668000	There was a neat making of file that I didn't really get to watch because somebody else was watching it on his computer.
1668320	1669601	I do believe it was on GameSpot.
1670427	1675489	Also, what they're saying about Soul Calibur 3 is that you will be able to create your own character.
1675589	1678209	So now it's going to be Barbie dress-up Soul Calibur, so that'll be fun.
1678229	1679370	That is totally up my alley.
1680870	1687452	But the Zahamuel guy uses a scythe.
1688092	1688592	That's cool.
1688812	1692033	I did see the pictures.
1692193	1693814	One of them looks just like Lulu.
1694334	1697195	Tira uses a giant chakram.
1698939	1702160	I think that's the one that looks just like Lulu from... No, it must be the other one.
1702360	1706762	There's one, I swear, that looks just like Lulu from Final Fantasy X. Like when I saw the pictures.
1706782	1708122	They're going into some neat weaponry.
1708742	1709262	That's kind of neat.
1709562	1716765	But it's kind of a bummer because I really thought Soul Calibur was best on the GameCube and yes, 95% of that is because Link was in it.
1717165	1721126	So it's kind of a bummer that... Well, actually... Actually, the Xbox one was really good.
1721166	1722086	Back it up a little bit.
1722146	1724187	Soul Calibur II was really best in the arcade.
1724607	1728068	So I'm really surprised that Soul Calibur III is not coming to the arcade.
1731039	1732380	I don't get that, but whatever.
1732600	1735763	I guess really good news for Soul Calibur fans that have PlayStations.
1736684	1739946	Well, and also the arcade market is kind of in a decline.
1740547	1740967	True.
1741087	1742088	It's just kind of sad, though.
1742328	1748934	Because there were some really, like, I thought the Conquest idea was pretty neat and it kept people entertained and having your character being built on there.
1749094	1750815	It's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of too bad.
1752016	1752577	But there you have it.
1754452	1755253	Nobunaga's Ambition
1770253	1771273	Wow, the strategy.
1771433	1772694	Yes, you remember this game on Nintendo?
1773034	1777435	Well, they're actually going to put out a brand new one on the PC this summer.
1777876	1785538	Now, this news is coming out of Japan, which, and the name when translated means Nobunaga's Ambition Revolution.
1786499	1789340	It's going to cost $107 in U.S.
1789400	1789680	funds.
1790160	1791080	Yeah, that's a lot of money.
1791420	1792361	Why is it so much?
1792581	1796302	I guess they're just... Does it come with, like, maps and books and crap?
1796662	1797983	I have no idea.
1798003	1798703	No idea.
1798743	1799203	No idea.
1801101	1803982	It comes with your own soldier who stays in your house.
1804082	1811804	There's a teaser page www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp
1822898	1833026	Nobunaga's Ambition was a cool game though, that's why I had to bring it up, because I remember that game on Nintendo My Ambition, the great game that's so expensive I remember when we went through this thing of trying to sell that game on eBay Did it work?
1833086	1833706	Did you find a buyer?
1833846	1847076	I think we got five bucks for it A couple more stories tonight Bungie has revealed that they will be doing nine brand new maps for Halo 2, but there's a catch
1847742	1851052	They're only going to be available for a fee on Xbox Live.
1851213	1852476	If you don't have Xbox Live,
1853140	1862406	I don't know what the hell you're doing with Halo 2 and not having Xbox Live, but if you don't have Xbox Live, you can get a separate $20 add-on DVD that will have all the maps for you.
1863146	1866428	The first maps will come out on Live late in April.
1866788	1873152	It's going to have two free maps, so you will get two of them for free, but then you're going to have to do two for purchase.
1873752	1880997	But they are saying that all the maps will be free at some point on Live by the end of the summer, so I don't know what's going on with that.
1881677	1909092	but then there'll be five more well I think it's just those four but then there'll be five more on live when the DVD is released but you know there's people out there that play Halo 2 all the time and they will pay the money for these new maps even if they're going to be free in three months you know it absolutely but I don't get the point of the DVD because honestly how can you have Halo 2 and not have live unless well maybe you're the type that plays in the dorm with the local area but
1909631	1912774	Really, I mean, Halo 2 was made for live, so.
1913094	1915716	I mean, it has a decent single player mode, but what's the point of the new maps?
1917278	1919160	Anyway, one more story.
1919780	1923964	So, did they mention that those new maps would have an actual ending for the game?
1925742	1927864	No, nowhere in there.
1927884	1933708	The new quest will begin where you're searching for the end of the game, but unfortunately you will not find it and you'll be utterly disappointed.
1933928	1934428	But guess what?
1934649	1942874	There'll be another $20 patch later on where there maybe will be an ending, but we can't guarantee anything unless we figure out more money.
1943275	1944736	We'll make you buy that Japanese game.
1944776	1944936	It's $100.
1946837	1953702	This is probably related to that story we reported on a couple weeks ago about the Korean Xbox site announcing some type of expansion for Halo.
1954400	1955881	Probably is the same thing.
1955941	1957563	So I think that answers our questions there.
1957683	1959244	Maybe not, but probably.
1960325	1961306	One last story.
1962647	1965630	Shadow the Hedgehog has a date.
1966691	1973356	And it's going to be coming out this winter on the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2.
1973757	1976779	Being developed by Sega Studios USA.
1977140	1979802	That explains that VG Cats comic then.
1981123	1982044	And in other news...
1982510	1984226	Halo 2 The Search for More Money
1987383	1989364	Of course, we don't know the rating or the pricing yet.
1989424	1993785	However, in Shadow of the Hedgehog, you will be able to control whether Shadow is a hero or a villain.
1994165	1995865	And it all depends on the paths you choose.
1996225	2000927	It's going to be shooting and racing through over 50 missions.
2001387	2003527	But can you marry the same sex in that game?
2003788	2004508	Shadow Fable.
2005488	2006268	What the hell?
2006688	2008549	That is a comment way out of left field.
2009029	2009929	It's just like Fable.
2010009	2011590	Fable, you can marry the same sex in that game.
2011610	2016171	Yeah, I know, but Fable and Shadow of the Hedgehog have nothing in common except that Shadow will be on Xbox as well.
2018052	2019292	Well, shit, I don't know.
2019932	2025234	I mean, there aren't that many female hedgehogs running around, so, I mean, you know, Shadow... Amy!
2025354	2030755	Well, one, does she get, you know, four-wayed by, you know, all the other characters?
2030775	2032216	We just need a Knuckles solo game.
2032376	2035897	Anyway, I think on that note, we definitely need to wrap things up.
2036237	2038017	Loki, any parting words for our listeners?
2038317	2041418	I mean, honestly, what's he gonna do for some lovin'?
2042694	2048319	My parting words are goodbye and keep your fingers crossed that I beat Minish Cap this week so I have something new to talk about.
2049179	2050000	DarkSakura, your final.
