442	3966	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 21st, 2005.
4567	16399	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming and all the news on video games that don't suck.
16659	20884	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
22173	26957	Hello, everybody out there in podcast subscribing land.
26997	29859	Thank you very much for deciding to check us out.
29899	30820	We appreciate it.
31320	38286	Here we are, the Orange Lounge Radio podcast, dedicated to what gamers really want to know out there on the internet.
38566	40207	Alright, my name is Sky, Rob Roberts.
40908	41628	Join me as always.
41668	44030	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie.
44670	46172	Yo, what up, my homies?
46672	49734	Alright, and also say hello to Loki, Matt.
49955	50515	Hey, what's up?
51664	53868	Silent Hill 3, all day
67235	68216	I've actually been cheating.
68677	70039	What part of Silent Hill have you been in?
70179	70840	I'm still in the beginning.
71020	71381	Silent Hill 3.
71902	76248	Does this have anything to do with the recent thunderstorms we've been having in the area here in Sacramento?
76409	77410	You call that a storm?
77630	80415	I know, but you know, for this area, it's a pretty big storm.
80735	81456	Weather wind.
82536	85758	Actually, no, it was... It had really nothing to do with that.
85818	90200	It's just we were playing with the... Trying to see if we were going to sell our Pro Action replay.
91100	94162	And then we just put in a bunch of codes and I was playing on Silent Hill 4 with the Heather beam.
95082	96202	Actually, with the sexy beam.
97683	101465	And with her magical transformation into Super Magical Girl Heather.
102986	108108	You get this wand, and when you equip it, you get a transformation sequence on top of that.
109662	110042	Alright.
110363	111103	It's funny.
111464	116348	I haven't played... Silent Hill 3 is like... I played a lot of Silent Hill 2 and I played a lot of Silent Hill 4.
117188	118810	I somehow completely skipped over 3.
119270	121973	I don't know how that happened, so... I need to give you back your 4.
122013	122493	I found it.
122553	123093	Yes, you do.
124355	124755	Give it back.
124875	125295	It's all good.
125956	126356	I don't mind.
126797	127517	I know it's in good hands.
128358	128958	Alright, is that it?
128978	129439	Just Silent Hill 3?
130587	132389	Some Final Fantasy XI, though hardly any.
132629	132709	No.
152295	153516	I don't know, I just thought I'd ask.
153576	155117	I usually sleep when it starts raining.
155878	158399	There's two things that are guaranteed to put me to sleep.
158940	160581	One is being a passenger in a car.
161702	165825	And the other is rain, especially rain on metal.
167066	169548	So when it rains when I'm in a car, it's an instant coma.
171349	174331	But thunder, rain, it puts me to sleep.
174792	175772	I can't sleep in the thunder.
176333	177013	I grew up in that.
177754	178474	I wake up too quick.
178915	180015	Alright, Loki, what have you been up to?
180035	180856	What have you been playing this week?
181954	185395	I've been playing actually some different games.
185675	193078	Other than Final Fantasy XI, I picked up Gran Turismo 4 and a game called Dog's Life.
194198	195099	What is Dog's Life?
195139	197720	Now this is different than Nintendogs, which we've talked about previously.
198160	198680	What's Dog's Life?
198720	207383	Dog's Life is basically this game where you play a dog and you run around and do what dogs do, like sniff smells and, you know,
211210	216133	Wait, so there's actually a button to crap?
216753	218314	Actually, it's a trick you have to learn.
219775	220816	To crap and fart.
221594	223214	And it's great about the game.
223234	225635	It's like learning how to throw a fireball in Street Fighter 2.
225735	227995	Just down towards punch.
228736	229456	Something like that.
229496	233197	But this game, it's very interesting.
233357	235117	It's more kind of a collection game.
235177	237177	It's really kind of meant for little kids.
237418	242179	But what's weird, though, is even though it's meant for little kids, there's a lot of this really crude humor that's in it.
243039	243719	It's a little odd.
244259	271333	but um the plot line is kind of seems like it's ripped from 101 Dalmatians a dog's been kidnapped by some woman named Mrs. Peach that makes dog food or something I don't know what exactly that's about but anyways um so she's kidnapping the dog and I haven't even really gotten that all I've been doing is running around in smell-o-vision which you can actually see the smells which is kind of neat you collect smells or whatever and then you get a bone or whatever and then
271872	277153	Or you can, you know, collect smells and race a dog and then you get to become this small little dog and run around.
278153	285575	It's just interesting, but one of the things I've been passing my time with is shitting, grabbing my shit, and then flinging it at people.
286355	287055	That's quite fun.
287716	288316	Right.
288496	294217	Like, for example, I jumped on top of a van and took a crap and then just ran away and then, like...
294941	296562	Yeah, just like small stuff like that.
296782	306927	You know, taking this out of context, like if we were to clip up the audio of this, and so you wouldn't know he was talking about a dog video game, that'd be quite hilarious.
308748	309588	Very incriminating.
310369	311790	We'll have to save it for a promo.
312350	312970	That's a good idea.
312990	314271	Alright, how's Gran Turismo?
315131	321274	Gran Turismo I played for about five minutes, just I played a couple of the arcade stuff, because I've been kind of mainly playing this dog game.
321555	322315	But anyways, Gran Turismo...
322779	324980	He's more into crapping on vans than driving them.
326001	330863	Okay, so I was playing Gran Turismo, and I had to remind myself why I sucked at Gran Turismo.
331083	333725	It's maybe because I can't steer for shit in the game.
334085	339828	But anyways, you start it up, and it starts playing this really opera-sounding music, and it's beautiful.
339868	346872	I mean, the graphics are really good, except the background and the audience, they're still 2D.
347032	348673	They're still flat and not moving.
348973	352095	Yet the game boasts on the back that the audience reacts to...
353414	376936	like what you do and the only guys that are like a ooh ah type of thing or i saw camera flashes and that's about it i didn't see the audience moving they're just kind of looking like like um jerry blank's dad in strangers of candy that's a reference nobody's gonna get whatever that's why they have to watch the movie when it comes out all right but um so that's what happened there um
377546	378627	But it was really good.
379027	381568	The second race I did was on an off-road course.
381688	385550	And I have to mention beforehand, they recreated all the tracks from the first game.
385990	386490	In this game.
386630	388071	So that's really cool, first off.
388471	392113	There's like, I forget, 100 tracks, 600 cars.
392673	393614	You start off with 240.
393654	395575	So that's like a ton to unlock.
396055	397075	And there's a ton of cars there.
397235	401017	The first car I played as was a Ford Focus, because that's what I drive.
401457	403819	So I decided to see how well of a race car that is.
404059	404619	And it's not.
405239	406460	And then I tried playing...
407501	408422	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
437646	439366	So, um, but I like it.
439386	442547	I gotta, you know, get into playing it more, and if I get frustrated, let's cheat.
444167	444587	Alright.
445048	445548	Sounds good.
445588	447788	I'm looking forward to hearing more about what you think about that game in the future.
448608	452269	Uh, myself, I'm still on the same games I was last week.
452309	454690	I've been playing Phantasy Star Online and Zelda Minish Cap.
454970	456670	I've been making a little bit of progress in both.
457050	459851	I now have two characters at level 10 in Phantasy Star.
459891	460411	Thank you very much.
460971	461051	Um...
461815	462816	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
482327	482907	It's insane.
483288	485649	But anyway, pretty much just been playing those same games.
485709	487510	Haven't had a whole lot of time to play any new stuff.
487831	494635	Besides the fact I went to the arcade and I played, you know, some In the Groove, which is that new dance game that's kind of trying to take DDR's throne.
495575	495956	We'll see.
496116	497036	Who knows what happens with that.
498097	499958	Alright, let's get into some gaming news.
499998	504441	Of course, what is on everybody's mind this week is the PSP is coming out.
505182	506582	I know I'm too broke to get one.
506602	507303	Bah humbug.
508003	509024	Why do you say bah humbug?
510135	511936	Just to be contrary, I'm actually getting one.
512396	514956	See, you're the lucky one that can actually get one of these.
515556	517457	I, unfortunately, am too poor to get one right now.
517497	518657	Somebody should send me a free one.
519637	520358	I like that idea.
521998	522998	You know, somebody should.
524959	525119	Me too.
525139	525879	It's nice to want.
526699	526999	All right.
528040	537662	If you want to get your hands on a PSP, if you want to be one of the first, well, you have to live in San Francisco because actually at the Sony Metreon, they're going to have a midnight sale today.
539441	541122	12.01am on the dot Thursday.
541642	542542	Here's the other part of that.
542582	550705	For those of you guys that are too lazy to pre-order, reserve, that kind of stuff, the Metron is going to sell them on a first-come, first-served basis.
550745	554446	So it'll be interesting to see what kind of people end up camping out this week.
554946	560207	There's also Best Buy is doing the exact same thing as far as... But not the 12.01 thing.
560928	565329	So if you're one of those people, you have to be the first to own it.
566360	567260	More power to you.
567320	569421	Get your ass on down to the Metreon and do that.
569441	579664	Well, they've definitely given you more to look forward to getting it first day because there's actually games out for it, whereas the DS, we're still waiting for games to come out for it.
579904	582785	Speaking of which, this was another news story I wanted to mention about.
583625	590167	The official launch of the PSP isn't happening until Thursday, but retailers are already selling the software.
590839	599048	Here's the thing, there's a restriction on the street date for the PSP, but there's no rules against distributing the software before the hardware street date.
599509	603833	People are out there and they are buying the games before the PSP.
604254	605475	They're at Fry's, I was there.
606176	608759	They had Wipeout, they had Metal Gear, they were there.
609022	611384	And for those who don't know, Fry's is a major chain on the West Coast here.
612064	612744	Fry's Electronics.
612905	613705	Yeah.
614706	621290	A lot of places I'm hearing are getting the game, so I don't understand why you would want to buy the game when you don't have the system.
621730	627294	Maybe you want to oogle over the instruction manual, or you just want to hold the disc in your hand.
628203	630784	and confirm that it's not going to play in a normal CD player?
631084	631865	I don't know why.
631925	636287	It's a smart way to build the hype, though, to go ahead and start making some money on it.
636447	638228	I guess, to have the display boxes out there.
638528	643250	Although I did think that they should have done like how they did with the Dreamcast, what Blockbuster did.
643891	647972	Blockbuster had a deal where you could rent Japanese Dreamcasts and play Sonic Adventure.
648273	648633	Oh, wow.
649273	654456	And then, of course, they had to send them all back, but you could actually rent just those two.
654836	657397	They should do something like that with the PSP, I thought.
657870	659037	you know that would be a way to
659679	661080	Let people see what it was like.
661260	663561	Well, they have the kiosks and stores now, right?
663641	664882	A few, yeah.
664922	667343	I've heard some folks have played the PSP hands-on.
667603	671385	Some places have got demo units for the staff.
671706	672666	Oh, interesting.
674267	675908	Well, the PSP is coming out this week.
675988	679010	I'm sure there'll be plenty of news all over the internet about it.
679070	682892	We're just kind of waiting to get our hands on one, and we'll definitely give you our feedback.
683192	687334	We will all have to share Jamie's PSP if she's willing to share next week.
687354	688855	You know, that's actually Dan's PSP.
689715	689855	Aw.
690075	691316	But I'm going to bring him next week.
692216	692457	Okay.
692857	693757	Yeah, steal it from Dan.
693777	694838	Whenever we have it, I'll bring him.
694998	697419	Dan can live without it for 30 minutes while we tape this podcast.
698860	699160	All right.
699820	704222	Reminder, guys, if you ever have any feedback on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, you can send us an email.
704302	709365	The email address is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
710126	713807	Since we talked about the PSP, let's talk about the competitor, the DS.
714387	716828	DS just rolled out recently in the UK.
717088	718169	Although, okay, you know what though?
718489	721510	It's weird for me to call the DS the PSP competitor.
722150	731833	I know that a lot of folks want to say, DS, PSP, DS, and it's like a big fight, but honestly, to me, and that's the way I felt about the two systems at first, especially at E3, but to me now...
732453	741498	Both systems really are incredibly different, and they really both have different things to offer, such as the PSP actually has games on launch date.
742498	746020	DS has, you know, the innovation touchscreen and all that other stuff, so...
747044	748525	It's hard for me to compare the two.
748605	748945	I don't know.
749025	751085	Jamie, is there a comparison for you?
751165	752306	Not really.
753106	756327	There's a difference between your DS and the great game launcher.
758128	759408	I wonder if you can still shoot games out.
759428	760509	You have to twist it pretty hard, though.
760529	763109	That's what I'm curious about, if the PSP is still going to be a great game launcher.
763530	765270	Remind us again about what was going on in Japan.
765830	769852	They had a failsafe built in so that you wouldn't hurt the games or something.
770112	770712	Something or the other.
771272	791860	that if you got too aggressive with the system and twisted it you know sometimes, you know I used to do it all the time with the old game gear and everything with the Nomad sometimes you get so into the game that you twist it just a bit like if you're doing a racing game or something but if you twist it in that manner it would shoot the game out you'll shoot somebody's eye out with that thing
793140	795521	Alright, sorry, I just wanted to get that out there.
795841	797122	Let's get to the DS story.
797402	804166	It actually just launched in the UK recently, and it sold 87,000 units in the first two days.
804546	809108	That makes the DS the biggest hardware launch in the UK to date.
809748	811589	They are calling this over Nintendo.
811629	818953	The general manager of Nintendo UK, David Yarrington, says, "...an unprecedented success, breaking all expected sales figures."
819488	821369	and even exceeding our expectations.
822049	824391	Good news for the Nintendo folks in the UK.
824911	826432	Now if we could just get some damn games!
827012	828073	Where's my Animal Crossing?
828133	828933	Where's my Castlevania?
830094	830654	Give it to me now!
832735	833055	Alright.
833776	838919	Also, in DS news, this was a really big thing that was going around this week.
840119	845162	Apparently, if you look in the recent issue of Nintendo Power, that's what I'm hearing,
845902	854446	Under Namco's planned DS titles, you can actually see Katamari Damacy DS is being planned.
855026	856087	That is so cool to me.
856707	861069	Now, I'm kind of wondering how you're going to control this, but you have any thoughts on this, Jamie?
861129	862790	I know you're a big Katamari Damacy fan.
863730	867452	Like that Pac-Man Marble Madness game that they had at E3, trackball.
868873	869233	Okay.
869473	870873	Do a trackball style with the stylus.
871174	872834	Interesting thoughts, like a little trackball.
872854	873395	Okay, all right.
873415	873495	Loki?
873955	874215	Loki?
874892	877313	That was my thought, too, as well.
877553	885777	Either that, or you'd use the directional pad as one analog, and the four buttons on the other side as the other analog, sort of.
886537	892060	I was kind of wondering how the whole two-screen thing is going to work in Katamari Damacy DS.
892340	896842	Like, is the top screen strictly for the King's package, or how's that going to work?
896882	897542	That's what I want to know.
898491	902653	No, probably be just, you know, stretched out, maybe a map on the bottom or something.
902893	905334	That's typical for DS games, have your little map on the bottom.
905634	909516	But then again, Kanamari Namashi, you know, I kind of would have liked a nicer map in that game.
909816	921302	It would be kind of neat, though, that if you are using the buttons and everything on the normal screen, and then on the lower screen, as your ball gets bigger, you know how your field of vision gets bigger, your map expands.
922242	923103	Okay, that'd be cool.
924514	925354	Some good ideas there.
925414	927815	So we'll see what the future brings for Katamari Namashi DS.
927935	928915	Very excited about that.
929015	929695	Very happy about that.
931335	931835	All right.
932655	932935	Let's see.
933096	935936	Also in DS news, I have one other story about the DS.
937616	938596	Just a quick one.
938636	946138	Majesco has announced that they're going to bring two new DS games out later this year, one of them being ATV Quad Frenzy.
946698	953179	And that's, you know, four-wheel in action on your DS, 40 different tracks, and you can upgrade your ride using the stylus system.
953610	954931	And it's got Wi-Fi support.
955411	958073	But the other game is Texas Hold'em Poker.
959293	962775	And I'm just kind of going, do we need another poker game?
962875	968859	To quote the best line ever from Mystery Science Theater 3000, the movie, well, whoop-de-shit.
971407	974288	What is with the popularity of all these poker games?
974368	980809	Because I keep seeing all these cheap Game Boy and PlayStation poker games for sale at Walmart.
980889	982129	Is it just because of the show?
982489	984430	It's not just that.
984610	991691	When I was at Fry's last night, they were selling poker tables, poker sets, just everything.
991971	994812	Is it seriously the popularity of that celebrity poker or what?
995332	996632	Poker is the new bejeweled.
1000416	1001738	It's funny you should bring up Bejeweled.
1015891	1043631	Banning Solitaire from computers and Minesweeper as well I'm not saying from every computer, you can do what you want in your house But from state computers and state offices like at the DMV, state insurance companies, things like that That's smart, disgruntled the DMV workers more But they're joking around calling this the country's first anti-solitaire legislation
1044926	1045908	And I'm just kind of thinking...
1054631	1057952	This has really become the new age time sink here.
1058272	1060773	And you know, I see it happen at my company where I work.
1060873	1068996	I walk around and when people are feeling unproductive, I see Bejeweled and what are all those other games they have on like Yahoo and PopCap?
1069276	1073297	The Insaniquarium I've seen, the Zuma is the other one.
1073357	1075198	We don't need to be working my job.
1075218	1076678	We don't have time to be working.
1077559	1081700	When you're, you know, handling... When I handle something anywhere between...
1082952	1086473	15 to 20 bankruptcy desk girl accounts doing their analyses by hand.
1087273	1087953	No.
1088453	1091114	They should have all of that locked out.
1091374	1098095	People that work in construction and jobs like that where you're not necessarily behind a desk probably get pissed off at these kind of stories.
1098495	1103776	Especially in North Carolina where it's like, damn right my tax dollars shouldn't be going to people playing solitaire all day.
1104197	1105817	I mean, doing it on your breaks, one thing.
1106237	1110558	And to folks at works credit, a lot of folks play Bejeweled on their breaks and that's cool.
1111118	1115221	I'm just glad that I can still check my school stuff during my lunch.
1115501	1116722	But I miss checking my live journal.
1118383	1120725	Loki, did you have something you wanted to share?
1120865	1121405	Yes, I did.
1122186	1128710	I was going to mention that Tuesday, or at least this last Tuesday, the Matrix beta has ended.
1129331	1132913	And I had to say they did it in a really interesting way.
1133994	1135255	Apparently, the...
1136693	1141397	The Matrix was being cleansed by a fire virus, so people started bursting into flames.
1141877	1144419	And I actually, I have some other crap.
1144759	1147281	The sky turned into a bunch of eyeballs.
1147801	1152225	And I actually have a video here for Rob to see real quick.
1152905	1154846	That is creepy as fucking hell.
1155127	1160491	And basically, you know, eyes floating around, the sky turns bright red and stuff.
1161011	1164434	And then, I guess at the very end of the game, once it was done, the
1165430	1166150	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1188362	1191423	It says, jack out now, discomfort will be extreme.
1192723	1193183	Wow.
1193283	1200605	There are signs in the club, like, time is running out, you are in violation, you are in violation, you know, you cannot hide, and stuff like that.
1200806	1211068	And apparently gigantic brawls were happening, where, like, some of the actual people from the game, or the movies, like Seraph and stuff, were fighting agents, and just nuts stuff going on.
1211108	1214029	They've got, like, you know, there was... That is crazy.
1214049	1216450	Fire virus people catching on fire, it's just...
1217743	1219564	It was really interesting.
1219745	1223208	The Matrix Online folks got pretty clever with how they're going to end their beta.
1223268	1224449	That was pretty awesome.
1224829	1231576	Can you imagine you're playing World of Warcraft and then suddenly your character just bursts into flames?
1231916	1233778	I didn't really play the beta that much.
1233978	1237501	If I actually jacked in and saw this, I'd be like, what the hell is going on?
1237702	1240845	There's beams of light shooting down from the sky and stuff.
1241585	1245649	Basically, your character literally just gets bent over backwards.
1245709	1249472	Sort of looks like the T-1000 getting shot with shotgun shells.
1249532	1250012	Wow.
1250913	1251193	Nuts.
1251574	1255177	But that's a really good sign, at least, of how the actual game's going to be.
1255217	1262223	Because if they're putting this much detail into the beta to bring up all the hype from this, you've got to wonder what the actual game's going to be like.
1262603	1264545	So that, I think, will be pretty interesting.
1264625	1265846	I've got to give my hands off to them.
1265866	1267588	That's a pretty clever idea there.
1267608	1267748	Yeah.
1269022	1272145	I hope this doesn't become a trend in MMOs.
1272465	1275768	Like on April Fool's Day, can you imagine some different MMOs doing that?
1275808	1280272	Like Final Fantasy XI suddenly turned the behemoths loose in the middle of the city.
1280532	1284475	Actually, that sounds like something they would have done on Ragnarok.
1284976	1289320	Dude, I had five wanderers come by and axe me.
1290661	1294324	Actually, in another time, I was lucky enough that I was high enough level.
1294724	1295405	I was left with...
1296221	1300185	Six hit points after taking one hit from Wanderer and my ass ran like hell.
1301766	1307591	Speaking of World of Warcraft, you guys, just because I was talking about MMOs and stuff and we were talking about the various ones.
1307891	1312395	World of Warcraft hit 1.5 million users this week.
1313656	1315057	I guess that's really all there is to say.
1315097	1316619	The game just keeps getting bigger.
1317620	1318460	Won't stop going.
1320262	1322444	Meanwhile, I'm all getting back into PSO.
1322504	1323845	Am I behind the times or what?
1325101	1351379	I'm still apparently paying for it, I'll play Well you know there's some news coming out on the new PSO We'll be talking about that in upcoming weeks as more news comes out Alright, and of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio on the to-go edition We are not only interested in bringing you the gaming news you really want to know But we want to better your life And who better to better your life with some advice Than our very own DarkSakura with her advice column
1353652	1355453	DarkSakura, what are you going to share with us tonight?
1356334	1359897	Today's tip is how to cross a piranha-infested river.
1360677	1362238	And how would one cross the river?
1362458	1364900	Number one, do not cross if you have an open wound.
1365140	1366621	Piranhas are attracted to blood.
1367642	1374007	Number two, avoid areas with netted fish, docks where fish are cleaned, and areas around bird rookeries.
1374367	1378970	Piranhas may become habituated to feeding in these areas and may be more aggressive there.
1378990	1379971	Number three,
1380336	1382078	Stay out of the water when piranhas are feeding.
1382499	1387885	When large numbers of piranhas are attacking prey, a true feeding frenzy, they may snap a bite at anything around them.
1388346	1390648	If you see them feeding, stay away or well upriver.
1392130	1390648	4.
1392490	1393472	Cross the river at night.
1393572	1398237	Virtually every species of piranha rests at night, and when awakened they will swim away rather than attack.
1398738	1400420	Piranhas are more active at dawn.
1401858	1405019	Some large adults may hunt in the evening.
1405039	1405019	5.
1405559	1407980	Swim or walk across quickly and quietly.
1408380	1412581	Do not try to create a large disturbance in the water that might awaken piranhas.
1414402	1414862	Be aware.
1415882	1417983	Piranhas are freshwater tropical fish.
1418683	1420704	In the wild, they only exist in South America.
1421264	1424025	and slow-moving rivers, backwaters, or floodplain lakes.
1424145	1426926	Piranhas generally do not live in either mountain lakes or streams.
1427267	1429027	The water is too cold and flows too fast.
1429948	1434029	Piranhas generally do not attack humans or large animals unless they are already dead or injured.
1434450	1438131	During the dry season, however, when food is scarce, piranhas can be more aggressive.
1438471	1446915	When driving cattle across a river suspected of containing piranhas, farmers will sometimes sacrifice a sick or injured animal downstream before letting the herd enter the water.
1448055	1449576	Now, the final piece of advice, Matt?
1449856	1450136	Uh-huh?
1451365	1452946	Don't cross the river in South America.
1453826	1454867	Don't go near the piranhas.
1455728	1457028	And if you have to, bring a gun.
1459230	1460350	Alright, dynamite.
1462231	1462792	Dynamite.
1463552	1465433	Thank you for that helpful piece of advice.
1465593	1468675	Just in case I should ever find myself in a piranha-infested river.
1468875	1469395	Appreciate it.
1469796	1470576	I'll keep them coming.
1470856	1471196	Alright.
1472157	1473778	From piranhas to turtles.
1474628	1481312	Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Melee is coming out on Xbox, GameCube, and PC.
1481912	1484574	It actually, it isn't coming out, it just came out this week.
1485955	1493019	It is by the same folks, by the way, who did Dance Dance Revolution Ultramix, the folks in Konami, Hawaii actually put this game together.
1494060	1500704	It is kind of, I guess if you really wanted to roughly describe this game, it's Mario Party with Ninja Turtles.
1501873	1508637	Not just the Ninja Turtles though, 16 other playable characters, Casey Jones, Shredder, etc, etc.
1509198	1510979	Rated T for teens, it's a budget game, $19.99.
1511079	1514221	It would make me happy if it has Usagi Yojimbo in it.
1515742	1517283	I don't have the list of characters, so no idea.
1518424	1525828	But you know, I think it's weird that there's all these Mario Party knockoffs, yet I have yet to play one as good as Mario Party.
1526108	1528090	And they have Mario Party Advance now too.
1529150	1529991	I saw that store.
1532030	1533651	It's all about Mario Party 6, I'm sorry.
1534911	1538252	I played the Sonic one, which I didn't really care for.
1538332	1541353	I played the Crash Bandicoot one, which I really, really didn't care for.
1541854	1545695	I played the Namco one a little bit, which was eh.
1547896	1549396	Just leave it to the folks who do it best.
1551897	1552237	Thank you.
1553778	1556479	Lastly, a little story on Halo 2.
1557876	1558817	I think this is interesting.
1559638	1573013	On a Korean Xbox website, the official Korean Xbox website, it says, coming soon, and it calls this game the X-Pack, which is a Halo 2 expansion pack.
1573833	1574134	Hmm.
1574154	1574214	Hmm.
1575072	1579694	No comment officially yet as to what this might mean for American audiences.
1580035	1581375	That means that Canada will get it first.
1582216	1583676	But wouldn't that be interesting?
1583716	1591761	You know, you get all these people to buy this game, and a lot of people were saying that the ending to Halo 2 was a little lacking, unfinal.
1592441	1593501	Geez, surprise!
1593741	1598544	Now you gotta spend another $20 on the expansion pack to really finish the game.
1598884	1600765	I tell you, Canada's gonna have it before we do.
1601265	1602966	Because remember, they got the Crystal X-Box.
1603687	1604287	Ooh, that's true.
1604307	1604507	We didn't.
1605222	1606883	They get all their neat stuff there first.
1606923	1607944	That's true.
1608224	1613667	Their Christmas bundle came with Halo 2 and some other really big game.
1614327	1615908	Where we got, what, two off-road games?
1616409	1616669	I know.
1617730	1620231	FIFA, soccer, and some other thing.
1620451	1621112	Tennis.
1622841	1629546	I don't know, is this something that... I know you guys aren't really huge on Halo, but what do you think of this whole expansion pack?
1629826	1633729	Sucker America into buying the game and then release the expansion pack.
1633809	1634670	It's kind of interesting.
1634970	1636651	More fodder for my motion sickness.
1637172	1639914	I can't think of any other companies that do that, Maxis.
1641375	1642175	I guess that's true.
1642616	1645038	I guess it's just part of the game.
1645078	1646178	Halo 2, bust it out.
1646479	1646899	All right.
1647566	1649827	Well, I always assumed they were setting up for Halo 3.
1651127	1653528	It'll be interesting if it's an expansion pack.
1653548	1655709	They're setting up for Halo 3, alright.
1655849	1656649	I wouldn't doubt it.
1657110	1658570	It'd be like Halo 2K.
1658730	1659691	See, they're worried.
1659931	1662372	They're worried about one game coming out in that game.
1662972	1664873	Timesplayers 3, Future Perfect.
1664933	1665773	Oh, yeah, I'm sure.
1666453	1669294	Hey, okay, that game has the oddest characters ever.
1669454	1670375	I love that game.
1670475	1672515	You're the only fan of that game I've ever met.
1672535	1673956	I also like Twisted Metal a lot.
1674396	1675597	I do love Twisted Metal.
1675617	1676637	That game rocks.
1678969	1682471	I love the giant eyeball game where, you know, the sky eyeballs.
1682491	1684232	I think you're thinking of Matrix.
1684912	1685553	Alright!
1686033	1688014	That's going to do it for this podcast.
1688034	1689295	Thank you guys for subscribing.
1689355	1691536	Final thoughts, Loki?
1692256	1697939	I wish all MMOs had giant red skies with eyeballs and lasers flying out of them.
1698479	1701100	That's what's really missing from Final Fantasy XI.
1701201	1702581	Laser beams on their freaking heads?
1703382	1705243	Laser beams and floating eyeballs.
1705283	1706003	But the floating eyeballs...
1706869	1709611	I've got to say, that's almost a ripoff of Lord of the Rings.
1709972	1710292	Almost.
1710812	1711313	Getting close.
1713875	1721521	My final thought is I'm very sad to hear that all my friends who saw The Ring 2 said it sucked, because I was looking forward to it.
1722542	1723042	DarkSakura.
1725084	1726445	Dead puppies aren't much fun.
1728067	1728447	They're not.
1728607	1728927	They're not.
1730689	1734712	And remember, folks, Robot Chicken, check your local listings, 11.30 on Sundays.
1737385	1739968	and I know it's being replayed throughout the week.
1740188	1741129	It's hilarious.
1741289	1742290	Hilarious.
1743731	1745112	Alright, have a good one you guys.
1745172	1746133	Thanks for subscribing.
1746153	1746974	We'll see you next time.
