1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
far too easily

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,000
leave your tears cause I will come back

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:17,000
I could hear that you whispered as you walked through that door

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
but still I swore to hide the pain

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
when I turned back the pages

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
shouting might have been the answer

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:36,000
What if I cried my eyes out and begged you not to report?

8
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,000
But now I'm not afraid to say what's in my heart

9
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,000
So if I and I have never been sober

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,000
They'll fly to you, crossing over with time

11
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:07,000
And this is holding you, suspended on silver wings

12
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,000
And a thousand words, one thousand confessions

13
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Will cradle you, making all of the pain

14
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,000
You'll still stay far away

15
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:26,000
They'll hold you forever

16
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The dream isn't over yet Though I often say I can't forget

17
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I still relive that day, you've been there with me all the way

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I still hear you say, wait for me I'll write you letters

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I could see how you stared with your eyes to the floor

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:29,000
But still I swore to hide the doubt

21
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
When I turned back the pages

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Anger might have been the answer

23
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:43,000
What if I'd hung my head and said that I couldn't wait

24
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:55,000
But now I'm strong enough to know it's not too late

25
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Cause a thousand birds call out to the ages

26
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,000
They'll fly to you even though I can't see

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I know they're reaching you

28
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Suspended or sealed away

29
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Oh a thousand words, a thousand embraces

30
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Will create a youth

31
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Making all of your weary days seem far away

32
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:33,000
They'll hold you forever

33
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Oh, a thousand, a thousand, have never been stolen

34
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:56,000
A thousand, a thousand, will carry you home

35
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, yeah

36
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The carry on

37
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Carry on

38
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And I can hold my arm

39
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
Suspended on two away

40
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
I'll sail away

41
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
In a thousand moons

42
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
All out through the ages

43
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
All through the ages

44
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Of great joy

45
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Lord of the lonely

46
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
It's your only day

47
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Holy day

48
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I'll hold you forever

49
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Ohh

50
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:31,000

66
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,280
We are still live though, you'd think we'd have somewhere better to be like church or

67
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,800
something, but no we're here to provide you with three hours of entertainment on this

68
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,460
lovely evening.

69
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,900
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

70
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:43,020
Joining me as always, my awesome, awesome co-host in this corner, the happiest bunny

71
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:47,220
on the farm, say hello to Miss Jamie Sommers, you know her better as Stark, Sakura.

72
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:52,020
Yeah, this is actually supposed to be a pagan fertility holiday, but oh well, blame, blame

73
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,860
uh, those people in Italy.

74
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,700
Yes, Dark Sakura by the way, she is, she is kind of the mother of the program, and she

75
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:06,220
is, she, she'll just tell it to you like it is, honestly, but she does it because she

76
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,600
loves you.

77
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,600
Don't let the attitude fool you.

78
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,600
Don't say the M word.

79
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Look, some friends of mine and Dan brought their baby to our brunch.

80
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:17,600
I need a hysterectomy.

81
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:22,600
Okay, the motherly, or the mother-ish?

82
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,600
I don't know.

83
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:30,600
I tried to say nice things for once, and I get shot down. Alright.

84
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:36,600
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa, or tonight he's Lego Massa. Loki!

85
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,600
Hi, I

86
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,120
You know, I've got to ask what you're building, but we'll talk about it. Well when we come back. Yeah, okay

87
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:46,840
Okay, are you doing on the cam though? So they can see the camera now? Well right now

88
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:49,280
I'm trying to make the mess. Oh another one of those and

89
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:55,700
I've been looking for this one piece and he's hunting right now ten gallons of Legos and honestly

90
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,960
Finding four pieces and ten gallons is like a needle in a haystack

91
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:02,960
I found three of the four needles, so I just need to find the last one.

92
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,960
Can you find the marble and the oatmeal?

93
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,960
Say hello as well to our regular guest.

94
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I can't say special guest, because damn, she's been here for the past eight weeks.

95
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:18,960
She's a regular guest now. DDR Angel.

96
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,960
Hello.

97
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:21,960
How you doing, Angel?

98
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:23,960
Pretty good. It's wet outside.

99
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,960
Yes, it's raining here in lovely Sacramento where we based this show.

100
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:31,960
this show, but as Jamie said to me last week, you call that a storm? Weatherwimp!

101
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:38,960
Yeah. Hey, you know, all I said was it was raining outside. That was it. I didn't say

102
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:45,960
it was horrible. It's just wet. Alright. It is wet, but anyway. Uh, we're high and dry

103
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:50,600
in here and we've got plenty of stuff to talk about tonight. We've got, uh, some general

104
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,960
video gaming news. Of course, your favorite segments. How was your week? How was your

105
00:09:53,960 --> 00:10:01,960
We're doing a giveaway tonight. We're going to give away some stuff to a lucky listener, so you're definitely going to want to be in on this and you can win a prize.

106
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:04,960
And that prize is not a 10 gallon of Legos.

107
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:07,960
No, it's not 10 gallons of Legos. It's something people might actually want.

108
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,960
And we're having another guest who's currently on his way with something neat.

109
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,960
Pie?

110
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:15,960
No, dammit. Can't eat this though.

111
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Yes, your fiancÃ© is on his way, yes?

112
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,960
Yes, with a something.

113
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:21,960
I'm excited about this. We'll have to talk about this.

114
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:22,960
It's his new appendage dammit.

115
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:32,600
except this is not for giving away yeah hell no all right was that the door I'm

116
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,960

120

Is he incarcerated?

155

Uh, actually, no he's not, but what do you think of the ever-ranty Dark Zakra?

Hi, dear, how are you?

173
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:43,720
here doing our thing here on orange launch radio hello to anybody who might

174
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:47,680
be new to our program as I understand it we may have some new people listening us

175
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,900
to us tonight as they might be for the next few weeks if for those of you guys

176
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:55,820
who haven't heard yet check this out we posted the news over on www.orange

177
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:59,980
launch radio.com you may remember a couple weeks ago we were saying ah life

178
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,040
Live 365 is doing this thing where they're going to, Live 365 of course being the site

179
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:08,000
that our program is hosted through, they're doing this thing where they're going to nominate

180
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,120
people to get awards, and we did it last year, we went to the awards ceremony because we

181
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,780
were actually nominated last year by the listeners for station, what is the station least likely

182
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:20,520
to hear on AM FM radio.

183
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:26,340
So we went to the ceremony, and we lost, to the, what was it, the station that played

184
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:29,820
porn music all day, which certainly is- Yeah, it was the porn station.

185
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:35,560
something you wouldn't hear on AM-FM radio all day, so it makes sense. So there was them.

186
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:39,780
So this year, we got nominated for that award again, thanks to our listeners. Well, guess

187
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:46,940
what? We also got nominated, I don't know how this happened, but we got nominated Broadcaster

188
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,980
of the Year. Us, Orange Lawns Radio. And we have our personal ninja to thank for that.

189
00:22:52,980 --> 00:22:58,460
This little dorky station dedicated to video games, half the people on Live 365 probably

190
00:22:58,460 --> 00:23:01,900
don't even I would know three-quarters of the people on my 365 probably don't

191
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:08,740
even know what DDR or bimani is DDR is the type of RAM that's what yeah that's

192
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,900
what most people think of when they think of DDR they don't think of dance

193
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:16,820
dance revolution but somehow and I know how it's our listeners it's our awesome

194
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:20,220
listeners helped us out with this and thank you guys so much for taking the

195
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:24,900
time to go in and nominate us somehow we got noticed and qualified for this award

196
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:30,580
so we're excited as hell. So we're definitely going to the awards ceremony again. If you

197
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:36,660
guys want to attend, we're going to post the information on our website. There were not

198
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:43,140
a whole lot of fans last year of stations, so I think if we were not only to go ourselves

199
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,460
but to get other people like a whole little entourage to be coming to the awards ceremony

200
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:51,860
too, that would kick butt. So you can come to the awards ceremony and you can watch Dark

201
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:57,220
Sakura and I drink like we did last year so it'll be fun. I need to just start

202
00:23:57,220 --> 00:24:01,820
doing vodka shots that way I'll be able to stay coherent longer. Yeah so actually

203
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:04,180
we had a good time the award show last year so I'm looking forward to doing it

204
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,860
again. We're certainly not expecting anything. We're nominated against some

205
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:13,480
pretty powerhouse stations and broadcaster of the year. Just some really

206
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:16,940
good stuff, some well-respected folks in the community, some good I think there's

207
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:20,940
like a really popular rock station and a couple regular radio stations that went

208
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:25,340
to the internet and I think there's an oldie station as well all really great

209
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:30,940
stations so we're just like shocked that we're even in that category to take this

210
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:35,220
station about video games and put it amongst these other four really really

211
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:40,380
great stations it's just like damn we win the internet we totally just wanted

212
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:44,500
the internet this week so we're very excited so thank you guys so much for

213
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:49,740
your help of course if you want to vote for us hey we would love it so check it

214
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:55,580
it out, there's a link on our website www.orangetonstray.com, there's a link there where you can go and

215
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,180
you can vote not only for the Broadcaster of the Year, but also most likely not to hear

216
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:07,740
on AMFM radio. And I think we're up against the Pokemon radio and I don't know, there

217
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,460
was a bunch of others. The Pokemon one sticks out of my mind because I've played Pokemon

218
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:18,580
and I have Pikachu dolls up here, so. Anyway, that's kind of fun. So hello to those of you

219
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:23,400
guys who are new to the station. Hope you enjoy it. This is the live three hour show

220
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,940
we do every Sunday night where we talk about not just music video games but really over

221
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:31,260
the past two and a half years we've been doing it. It's just mutated into a show where we're

222
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:35,660
just kind of sitting around a bunch of geeks that are into video games just talking about

223
00:25:35,660 --> 00:25:38,820
what's up. So we always start off the show by doing a little segment called How Was Your

224
00:25:38,820 --> 00:25:42,540
Week? How Was Your Day? Where we answer that question. What's up? What's going on? So we'll

225
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:49,400
start off with the lovely Dark Sakura. What's up? My week, wow. Well, there wasn't

226
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,220
really too much going on. I did a lot of exercise because I'm training for the

227
00:25:53,220 --> 00:26:02,000
Mud Run. I'm working out with Iguana Girl four to five times a week now. Now, what

228
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,820
is the Mud Run, for those who don't know? The Mud Run, and I'll see if I can't post

229
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:11,000
something in the chat room, like a map of it. It's a military obstacle course by

230
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:15,880
Marines every year and the Marines do a five-mile obstacle course first and then

231
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:20,080
it's up at the civilians. They've opened up a two-mile course which is just twice

232
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:31,000
around the course. So that's what we're gonna do. It'll be pretty fun, you know, climbing over hay bales and scaling walls and swimming through a mud trench.

233
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,000
Does the winner of this mud run, do they win immunity?

234
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:45,620
however you do get a trophy and it's a you know how they do the no bags of rice

235
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:51,260
or fire for this one okay you know when a phone call home or you know a chance

236
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:56,900
to go out on the boat all right well that's cool good luck with that take

237
00:26:56,900 --> 00:27:01,140
pictures we want to see like because we need to get bio pictures for the website

238
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:04,700
so we want to see a picture of you after this thing is over just looking like hell

239
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,700
I'll give you a picture of Bio.

240
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,700
You guys have to come. Yeah, you guys have to come watch.

241
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,700
We'll watch, but...

242
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:19,700
See, this is the ironic thing that DarkSakura, you know, she may sound like, you know, she's nice and sweet and all that, but damn, she's the toughest one here.

243
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,700
I'm a big chicken. I could never do that mud run, so...

244
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,700
I have chocolate.

245
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:32,700
See, I'm cheating like hell today, because we went to Marie Callender's for their brunch, like we do with a group of friends of mine every year.

246
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:39,700
There's some stupid drama going on now, so one person and then several more people didn't come, because one other person was going to be there.

247
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:44,700
And then some friends of ours brought their baby, which convinced me never to know.

248
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
Uh oh, I'll talk up.

249
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,700
Alright.

250
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:53,700
Um, Thursday Dan brought home his new appendage.

251
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,700
Which is?

252
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:56,700
The PSP.

253
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,700
Oh, I want a PSP so bad, I hate being poor.

254
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:06,700
I was really down on the PSP for a while, but now I'm really into it, because it's got that nice, wide screen on it.

255
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:14,700
The games look so much better. Basically, you're carrying around the PS2, whereas with the DS, you're carrying around an N64.

256
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:19,700
You know, I really think that Sony took advantage of...

257
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:26,700
Well, actually, I've heard that the PSP is about the equivalent of Dreamcast power, as far as 3D's concerned.

258
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:32,800
learned? You haven't played Ridge Racer then? But the games, whatever the hardware is it

259
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:37,580
runs on, the games look pretty. I did check this out because I was over at your house

260
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:41,860
on Thursday as well, and I was checking it out, they were playing Ridge Racer, and dang,

261
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:46,180
that game was pretty. Like, it was so much better looking than I remember the PSP from

262
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:53,180
E3 last year, so that was pretty cool to see. It was, oh, why thank you. It was very cool.

263
00:28:53,180 --> 00:28:59,180
I am very pleased with it. I played Darkstalkers. My one complaint is that it hurts my left

264
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:04,180
hand when I play. Because that was on Darkstalkers. The analog button is so awesome on that one.

265
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:09,700
Did you notice that I happened to notice that on the bottom left there was this little circle?

266
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:13,580
I was too entranced looking at the visuals on the screen. I had no time to look at the

267
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:16,660
actual system. So I was looking at it going, what's that? And you guys were like, it's

268
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:27,300
your analog stick it was really cool at any rate we've been we have five games

269
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:32,620
for it we have wipeout pure we have Metal Gear Solid Acid which is a strategy

270
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:39,640
game so I'm like on it Ridge Racer that puzzle game was it called I want that

271
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:44,160
Lou mines game how is that did you play that at all oh I've heard Lou mines

272
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,780
something that like if you're into the music video games you know because it's

273
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,720
by the guy who did what rez and all that stuff if you like music video games I

274
00:29:51,720 --> 00:30:00,380
hear Lou mines is just the poo well I I really though I've me I'm a fighting

275
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:04,500
game that I had to play dark soccer so it was really awesome and the sound is

276
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:09,100
really good on that thing too it doesn't sound all tinny like some things do well

277
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:12,100
Oh, I should hope so with Sony putting it out and everything.

278
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:17,100
Well, um, we also, though, found a web page.

279
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
Can't hear you, hon.

280
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:19,600
We also found something on a web page.

281
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:21,100
Well, Dan found this.

282
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,600
Where someone used Wipeout Pure, because there's

283
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,600
a way you get onto, like, their website or something.

284
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,600
But the website wouldn't load, and someone actually

285
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:32,600
used it to get onto, uh, um.

286
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Hackaday and Slashdot.

287
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,100
Yeah.

288
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,600
Yes, they found a way to actually use the Wipeout

289
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:45,240
website as a proxy for, um, getting on the internet. Now I've heard that, actually, one

290
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,440
big popular thing going on on the PSP right now is loading pornography on the memory sticks,

291
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,480
so you can have video with you to go, and of course people go straight for porn.

292
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:59,520
Well, um, they actually, we actually were looking for a one gigabyte, um, memory stick,

293
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,380
but they didn't have them anywhere where we went. GameStop is supposed to be carrying

294
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:04,380
them soon.

295
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:09,220
I want, if I were to get that, the first thing I'd load on would not be porn, it'd be robot

296
00:31:09,220 --> 00:31:10,220
chicken.

297
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:14,340
We put like some video game trailers and stuff on it.

298
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:18,620
And Dan of course had to have some songs on there.

299
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:22,180
Like the two songs he really likes in 2DX.

300
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:32,340
Which is the one from Gradius 2, Burning Heat, and Twinbee.

301
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,720
And then I played a whole crap load of Silent Hill 3 yesterday.

302
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:37,720
So probably next week.

303
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,720
I cheated so bad.

304
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,720
Right on.

305
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:46,820
And then we went to the brunch today and I got my graphics tablet yesterday too.

306
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:52,940
I have a Wacom Intuos, I think it's gorgeous, and it's so lightweight and it's like the

307
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:58,380
perfect thing because I can sit back, you know, with sort of half in my lap and half

308
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:04,380
hanging on my keyboard desk and I can just draw it's awesome so I'm trying to

309
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:09,100
practice how to ink a little bit and then I sort of feel like I've been

310
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,660
hanging you know hiding out under a rock for the past three years but I have

311
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:17,860
finally dawned on the universe you know discovered the universe of gorillas

312
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:26,220
fandom and I've gone completely bonkers. Are you talking about gorillas in the mist or

313
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,220
No, like the band.

314
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:35,220
Alright, anything else you want to share about your week?

315
00:32:35,220 --> 00:32:36,220
I want pizza.

316
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
Alright, eat that pizza.

317
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

318
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,220
Uh, my week was okay.

319
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,220
Alright, first, wait a minute, first off, I hate to cut you off, but first off, tell us what the hell you're building over there with the Legos.

320
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:48,220
Which, by the way, you can see on camera right now, www.orangelsradio.com

321
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:55,220
Uh, well I haven't built anything yet, because I was trying to find this goddamn piece, and I cannot find it for the life of me, I have like eight of them, and I only found three.

322
00:32:55,220 --> 00:33:02,220
three. And I need four. But, because I'm smart, I'll make it work. So, um, now what I'm building

323
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,100
is, and you can find the link to this on our website, because I posted it there. It's a

324
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:14,700
Nintendo DS charging dock. And it holds games and whatnot. And there's a link to the instructions

325
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:22,140
on our website. Just check it out. Um, www.orangelandtraded.com. And this was posted on a bunch of different

326
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:27,220
ahead. This guy made it. And it's pretty nifty. So wait, is it like with the iPod, how you

327
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:32,580
have those little chargers? It's supposed to emulate that, but for a DS? Sort of. Basically,

328
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:37,580
the charging cord or whatever, it just sits there and you set the DS right on top of it

329
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,700
and away you go. And it has spots for games and stuff. So I thought, because I saw the

330
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:44,520
charger over there sitting there, I was like, you know, that'd be pretty cool to put one

331
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:49,580
over there and just set her DS on it. So yeah, that's what I'm building right now. God, this

332
00:33:49,580 --> 00:33:58,080
my hat's hot. Put this on my head. Anyways, so, yeah, that's what I did. And then throughout

333
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,680
this week, I was supposed to hear about my job, whether I got the new one or not, and

334
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:08,400
they didn't let me know because they're retarded. So, I got to wait until next week. But I'm

335
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:14,120
sure I got it. Everyone's telling me that I have it, so I guess I have it. And for those

336
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:18,040
of you who haven't been listening, it's a game sales position at our company. Our company

337
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,920
is actually a video distributor and now we're going to be selling games because we bought

338
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:28,080
a game company. So that'll be fun. And so that's what's going on there. Just been, you

339
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:35,160
know, getting ready to move and stuff. Playing a lot of games. I spent way too much money

340
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:41,840
on games this week. I've been playing a lot of God of War and some of this, I mentioned

341
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,080
it last week, the Dog's Life where you can eat poop and throw it and stuff.

342
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,080
That's lovely.

343
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,080
That's all dogs do.

344
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,080
Well, I also got Gran Turismo 4, which I just remembered after I purchased Gran Turismo 4.

345
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:00,080
You know what? I didn't play much of Gran Turismo 1 when I bought it.

346
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:03,080
And guess what? I haven't played much of Gran Turismo 4 when I bought it.

347
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,080
I have a remedy for you.

348
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,080
What?

349
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,080
Let me bring over the Logitech wheel.

350
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:08,080
Maybe.

351
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:14,080
And then I also got TimeSplitters 3, because I have all three TimeSplitters games now.

352
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:21,080
and, you know, you gotta love a game where you can actually drive a cat. So, um, I love

353
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:26,780
TimeSplitters. 150 unlockable characters. I gotta, gotta love that game. It's just so

354
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:33,320
much fun. I don't know. It's really, I think people don't really look at it as a very good,

355
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:36,240
I mean, it's like a shooter. Everyone's always looking at Halo. But the best thing about

356
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:41,080
this, it's actually an online game for the PS2. So I'm, gotta try the online mode with

357
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:46,640
that it'd be interesting so that's what I've been doing pretty much yeah all

358
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,920
right sounds good oh and lots of Final Fantasy level my black

359
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:57,720
major 56 congratulations all right my week in my day let's see not a whole lot

360
00:35:57,720 --> 00:36:01,400
because we're looking for the new orange lounge studio right now at least the one

361
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,800
that's gonna you know hold us over the next phase of orange lounge because as

362
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,760
you know Loki and I live together and that's where we do this show right now

363
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:13,080
out of this house however we're moving out at the end of April so we've put in

364
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:16,400
a bit at a place and we're hoping that'll happen because if that works

365
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,120
orange lounge will have its own room we're gonna have it kind of like the

366
00:36:20,120 --> 00:36:23,400
very first studio was it was his own room so that's gonna be very nice so I'm

367
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,000
really hoping that happens also this week I went to a party last night and it

368
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,320
was kind of one of those nerd parties although it was kind of sad because I

369
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,760
brought my DS because I thought hey it's a nerd party so I'm gonna take my DS and

370
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:39,760
we'll be able to do some wireless I was the only person there that brought a DS

371
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:44,600
and then they were making fun of my carrying case which is yes the same one

372
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:48,680
you bought me DDR Angel um they're making fun of the carrying case because

373
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,120
they said it looked like a makeup case so I was you know just messing around

374
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:54,880
and I would open up the case like pretend it was a makeup case and I take

375
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:59,440
out the stylus and pretend to be painting my eyelashes with it so I don't

376
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,800
know I guess it's something you have to see which doesn't work on radio the

377
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:05,800
highlight of the week was watching America's top model yes the highlight of

378
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:12,000
of my week was for the first time, I can't believe I've been missing this gem of a show

379
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:18,120
on UPN, America's Next Top Model. It's just a bunch of bitches fighting with each other.

380
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,120
It's so awesome.

381
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:23,880
But you've got to love a show that next week has flesh-eating viruses in it.

382
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes, yes.

383
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,880
You've got to love that.

384
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:30,920
Seriously, I know there's a lot of hatred for reality TV out there, but damn is it entertaining.

385
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,040
And it's certainly more entertaining than turning on the news and hearing about that,

386
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:38,600
you know woman in Florida for the gazillion time I'm so over her. I forgot to mention

387
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:42,380
earlier I got some new movies and I think I should mention it to Rob. We watched this

388
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:48,800
one called Red Silk or whatever and it was the weirdest movie I've ever seen where these

389
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:53,060
women were naked like the entire time and they were old and nasty looking and there

390
00:37:53,060 --> 00:37:56,760
was just like some weird dream sequences with like a kaleidoscope and stuff and it made

391
00:37:56,760 --> 00:38:00,420
no sense and you couldn't understand them and in fact I actually had to read the back

392
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:04,640
of the box to figure out what the plot was because I couldn't figure it out from just

393
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,240
watching it. And then, it's just, it's just really strange. But then I also got this movie

394
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:18,120
called, and this is like typical fashion for me, um, it was Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction,

395
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:23,200
to go with my new movie that I'm going to be getting, which is, um, what is it, uh,

396
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,380
blood-sucking vampire rednecks.

397
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:28,860
That's nice.

398
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:31,660
I love bad movies.

399
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:34,980
Hey, can I talk about my week again now? Yeah, go ahead. That should cut me off. Alright.

400
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:39,440
So I went to the party, so nobody really had a DS, so we were playing

401
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,020
Super Smash Brothers Melee,

402
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,620
which is always a good time,

403
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:45,860
and I'm so upset that they have not made a sequel to that game. I mean, how can they

404
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:48,900
have not made a sequel to Super Smash Brothers as of yet? I played that just the other day.

405
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,900
Why don't they have something on DS yet? Oh yeah, I forgot, the DS doesn't have any games.

406
00:38:53,900 --> 00:39:02,900
Um, oh well. So we played that, we played a little bit of Mario Party, which also needs to come out on the DS, although I guess they have a GBA version? I don't know.

407
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:07,900
I'm so lost on the handheld loop right now, because I'm all bitter because I can't have a PSP yet, so.

408
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:12,900
Alright, so that was pretty much my week of my day. Nothing else that exciting going on.

409
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,900
DR Angel, how about you? What's up?

410
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,900
I played Bimani this week. Ooh. Well, it's a DDR.

411
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,900
And, uh, In the Groove. Yay. Um.

412
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,900
You can see, what, what? What'd you think of In the Groove?

413
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:31,900
We already talked about that. Small arrows.

414
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:35,900
And then I noticed that, uh, oh, how do I even say that? Like, it starts off

415
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:39,900
small and then it pans out kind of a thing. You know what I'm talking about?

416
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:43,900
The way the arrows scroll? The weird scrolling thing it does? Yeah. Just call it the

417
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:49,580
and the groovescrolling thing that makes no sense and i'm like damn you only see that though if

418
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:57,100
you're like really paying attention to the arrows it's kind of funky um also let's see what else i

419
00:39:57,100 --> 00:40:06,140
do this week oh i got to play a different uh gamecube game this week uh what's that star

420
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,340
uh... starfox assault

421
00:40:08,340 --> 00:40:09,780
it's pretty

422
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:11,780
it's star foxy

423
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:14,820
and uh...

424
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:18,660
i don't know not not too much else

425
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:23,140
i need to find my chains of promothea discs

426
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:27,220
they've they've uh... sprung legs and walked away

427
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,300
oh well

428
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:31,180
i guess it's telling me not to install it again

429
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,820
if i can't find them

430
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:34,300
i'll fix it

431
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:42,660
I'll find some way to play again, because I need to.

432
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,980
Because I need to get out of the level 20 slump.

433
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:49,340
Other than that, hey, nothing else.

434
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:52,220
Spring break was good, and then I have to go to school again.

435
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:52,720
Yay.

436
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:57,180
All right.

437
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,740

449
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:43,720
this show but

450
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:47,200

452
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:51,800

454
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,360
anything on chat room or on skype line just yet cause we'll be getting to that a little later

455
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:06,540
show. I'll let you know when. Anyway, meanwhile, as of course, as you know, we do

456
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,460
this show based out of Northern California, so we try to keep tabs on

457
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:14,040
what's going on in the NorCal DDR scene. We always like hearing from you guys

458
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:18,020
what's going on in your neck of the woods via the Skype line. However, we did

459
00:42:18,020 --> 00:42:21,740
have a large tournament that took place yesterday. It's the March Madness

460
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:25,300
tournament, and I feel kind of bad because this is the very first year, I

461
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:28,580
think, where I have not gone to March Madness, unfortunately. I just had some

462
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:34,080
other stuff going on that day but March Madness was going on from what I

463
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:39,780
understand freestyle was won by thinner Mr. Wendell which I believe is Mel B

464
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:44,720
under a different pseudonym and there's actually a tie between him and 001

465
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:49,960
actually picked up the freestyle winner there so good job and the reason why it

466
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,880
was a tie because both competitors showed equal talent in the choreography

467
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:59,300
an improvisation part. It was a very interesting freestyle setup. They had

468
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,420
kind of this tiered thing where it was improv and then you went on to the next

469
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:07,380
tier and it was a planned routine and then the last one you had to learn a

470
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:10,820
routine. Like it was totally like America's Next Top Model all of a sudden.

471
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:16,140
So in the last round they tied those. That's pretty cool. And then I haven't

472
00:43:16,140 --> 00:43:20,860
seen where the perfect attack scores are but I'm trying to dig through the thread

473
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:25,140
right here trying to figure out what's going on looking at the wrap-up over on

474
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:30,980
DDR freak the winner was Billy jr. it looks like for perfect attack with

475
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:39,500
second place chaos the last round max shuffle very interesting but this is the

476
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:44,260
interesting part only 24 people entered perfect attack this year which is kind

477
00:43:44,260 --> 00:43:48,220
of yeah it's kind of a little bit down from where it was previously so I really

478
00:43:48,220 --> 00:43:53,540
feel bad that I wasn't able to go. I just had other stuff going on, but is this a sign

479
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:57,380
that the DDR tournaments are running out of steam? What do you think? I mean, Jamie, you've

480
00:43:57,380 --> 00:43:59,900
been to a lot of DDR tournaments. Do you think it's starting to run out of steam, or what's

481
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:05,620
up? Honestly, yeah. I don't... I mean, I'm kind of sad that I missed out on going to

482
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:12,460
this one, but, you know, March Madness has been getting a little bit smaller and smaller

483
00:44:12,460 --> 00:44:17,620
that I've noticed for the few years that I've been to it. What do you think? Which is too

484
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:21,060
too bad because it's a really good tournament, it really is, and Mike does an excellent job

485
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:27,980
putting it on. I miss the little turnies though, and I don't see as many popping up. It seems

486
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,380
like everybody wants to have a big deal tournament these days, but the sad thing is that with

487
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,620
Konami not really supporting DDR in the arcades, it's really starting to wear thin. I mean,

488
00:44:38,620 --> 00:44:43,340
I know I'm starting to feel it. Of course, in the groove now, folks are starting to move

489
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:47,340
into in the groove tournaments but I mean it really depends on how you feel

490
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:52,260
within the groove that game is kind of polarized the gaming dance gaming

491
00:44:52,260 --> 00:44:56,260
community as it is so I think a lot of folks you know if they're not into in

492
00:44:56,260 --> 00:44:58,940
the groove they're not gonna check out one of these tournaments so I don't know

493
00:44:58,940 --> 00:45:03,500
it's just kind of too bad I hope it's not a sign that DDR is dying in the

494
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:08,340
arcades but at the same time without new DDR the heck are we supposed to do I

495
00:45:08,340 --> 00:45:12,700
don't know people are coming up with clever ideas though to keep it fresh so

496
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:20,140
know, hats off to them. Loki, any thoughts on the tournament? I don't know, I haven't

497
00:45:20,140 --> 00:45:25,140
been in a tournament in a long time, just not my thing, I don't know. I think a lot

498
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:34,780
of people are just, I don't know, just tournaments, maybe because the crowd that's getting into

499
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:40,620
it now is more new at it or something, and that's why they feel maybe a little intimidated

500
00:45:40,620 --> 00:45:46,180
to go up against these people? Maybe that's my guess. Or the fact that these people that

501
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:50,580
are coming in are getting introduced to it, like, on the home console, maybe they're just,

502
00:45:50,580 --> 00:45:54,620
you know, not really getting into it with the, like, environment, like the crowd and

503
00:45:54,620 --> 00:46:00,020
stuff as they would, you know, if they started off in the arcade. I don't know. That's my

504
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:06,320
guess. Yeah, I think it's just kind of too bad. I mean, that it's just not the huge thing

505
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:10,880
it was and you're right maybe a lot of those because people starting on the

506
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:16,880
home mixes now but I'm surprised that I don't see more if that's the case more

507
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:22,400
of these tournaments that are conducted on home mixes but maybe that's because

508
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:29,600
of the fact that maybe that's because the fact that it's kind of harder to run

509
00:46:29,600 --> 00:46:33,280
a fair tournament on home mixes I don't know what do you guys think do you think

510
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:36,280
Do you think it's possible to run a fair tournament on home mixes with home pads and stuff?

511
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,280
Absolutely. We did it at Shaft.

512
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,280
Yeah.

513
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:44,280
When we had to do a quick fix, we pulled up modded pads and he won second place.

514
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,280
Yeah, that's true.

515
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,280
Hell no. Home mixes suck.

516
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:53,280
By the way, the fiancÃ©e of Dark Sakura has just joined us, Dan the Man, is back.

517
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,280
You may remember him from a couple weeks ago.

518
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,280
He was here telling you guys to go buy ignition pads at his local GameStop.

519
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:02,280
By second legendary appearance.

520
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:04,720
So, did it work? Did anybody buy any?

521
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,320
Hell no. Damn.

522
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:09,280
Nobody buys the ignition pads. I think we sold one.

523
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,500
Oh, that was from us. So to replace it, they sent me two cheap

524
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:18,640
GameStop brand knock-off ignition pads. Oh, hooray. Fuck y'all.

525
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:23,240
Alright, now you brought a treat to show us here in studio tonight, correct?

526
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:26,000
Uh, yeah. What's that?

527
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:31,760
My pants. Hooray!

528
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,060
No, really, what'd you bring?

529
00:47:33,060 --> 00:47:34,060
Ooh, PSP.

530
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:35,060
Is that a PSP?

531
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,660
Ooh, we gotta put that on cam.

532
00:47:36,660 --> 00:47:40,060
So we'll be, we'll be showing that on cam during the break so you guys can see how pretty

533
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:41,060
it is.

534
00:47:41,060 --> 00:47:44,660
Should we try to get some of the music on it if we can get the speakers to pick it up

535
00:47:44,660 --> 00:47:45,660
because it's really...

536
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:47,900
We might be able to do something where we can hook into the mixing board.

537
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,460
Well, we'll see what we can do.

538
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:51,140
It's got USB connection on it.

539
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:52,140
Oh, right on.

540
00:47:52,140 --> 00:47:53,140
Yeah.

541
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:54,140
Wow.

542
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,140
Alright.

543
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:56,140
Well anyway, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna go to a break.

544
00:47:56,140 --> 00:48:00,400
When we come back from the break, we'll talk a little more about some news going on, um,

545
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,520
we're going to open up the Skype line I think in the next break so get that

546
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:06,680
fired up you guys not for the match game though just for you guys to be able to

547
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:11,200
comment on the show if you want so far so we'll be back after this next break

548
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,160
in this next break we're actually going to play some music from 2d x9 style but

549
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:20,880
this is brand new music from the home version we call these consumer tracks so

550
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:24,840
when they are made songs specifically made for the home release of the game so

551
00:48:24,840 --> 00:48:27,720
we're going to hear some brand new 2d x9 style songs we're going to start it off

552
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:33,240
with a brand new LED song it's called photogenic so enjoy this and three other

553
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:40,240
other songs and we'll be back after this.

554
00:49:03,240 --> 00:49:07,880
My fear is depression

555
00:49:07,880 --> 00:49:13,400
So I thought we'd discover dreams come true

556
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,840
Taking you to the place with your whole dreams

557
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:25,400
Open the door to tomorrow

558
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:31,400
Go to hell, believe in the truth

559
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:36,400
Believe in the truth

560
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:18,400
This is the first time I've ever seen a man like this in my life.

561
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:27,400
This is the first time I've ever seen a man like this in my life.

562
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,400
Oh

563
00:52:27,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Enjoy our party, see how we play Dance till we are one, don't stop, don't

564
00:52:56,400 --> 00:53:02,400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

565
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:09,400
See you in the next video!

566
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:25,400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

567
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:57,900
It's only a long way to go

568
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,900
This is a great deal

569
00:53:59,900 --> 00:54:02,400
Come on, come on

570
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:05,900
Don't you look into me like I know

571
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:07,400
But I can't take

572
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,400
To get up to the valley with no love

573
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:15,400
I can't take

574
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,900
To get you without a chance to

575
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:20,900
Come on

576
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:23,900
Show me a diamond stick

577
00:54:23,900 --> 00:54:29,900
Feel it in your heart and feel it in your soul

578
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,900
And you could say it's done for all

579
00:55:59,900 --> 00:56:29,300
And

580
00:56:29,300 --> 00:56:35,460
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

581
00:56:35,460 --> 00:56:38,740
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

582
00:56:38,740 --> 00:56:42,820
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More

583
00:56:42,820 --> 00:56:43,820
program.

584
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:44,820
Can we talk about that?

585
00:56:44,820 --> 00:56:46,820
No subject will ever be taboo.

586
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,540
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

587
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,580
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

588
00:56:54,580 --> 00:57:00,080
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the attack music we play on the station?

589
00:57:00,080 --> 00:57:02,080
I collect your fucking head.

590
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:05,080
Just like this fucker here.

591
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:14,080
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

592
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:21,080
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

593
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:26,080
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

594
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:33,080
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break.

595
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,080
Some brand new music. We're playing on Orange Lounge Radio for the first time.

596
00:57:36,080 --> 00:57:40,080
Some tracks from 2DX Night Style, the consumer version.

597
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:44,080
We had a night break. We had some LED with Photogenic.

598
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:48,080
OTA2 with Usual Days, a remix there.

599
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:53,360
Gupperslope with 80's Capsule and the brand new Jaeger remix which I guess is

600
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:57,340
to complete some type of trilogy or something going on there so I don't know

601
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,780
how I feel about that new Jaeger remix so because it sounds to me like it's the

602
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:06,060
hamster dance. Yeah it's not very good. They need the Jaegermeister mix now. Now that would be

603
00:58:06,060 --> 00:58:11,180
awesome but the video is kind of cool so you know what can you do about that? All

604
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:17,720
the strong Jaeger ones are pretty cool. Right. All right so what we're gonna do

605
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,320
now is we actually we are gonna we are gonna take your calls over the skype

606
00:58:21,320 --> 00:58:25,040
line pretty briefly here we're gonna do that this segment and we're also gonna

607
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:27,520
be doing the match game we're gonna be doing some giveaways tonight we're gonna

608
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:34,320
give away some music from Resident Evil 4 and the ESPN NBA 2005 soundtrack I

609
00:58:34,320 --> 00:58:38,520
know we don't usually do sports games on this show but tonight we're feeling

610
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:42,520
saucy it's a special night tonight we're all encompassing and because we're

611
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:46,560
feeling saucy we reserve the right to change things as we go here with this

612
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:52,100
program straight so I call that my influence as the resident female yeah I

613
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:58,300
know that's fine as the resident moody female yes moody just love you all right

614
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:02,820
so what we're gonna do actually is we also had just recently come out within

615
00:59:02,820 --> 00:59:05,900
this past week we had service Pat I'm sorry I keep calling these things

616
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:11,500
service back song pack 9 just came out for DDR ultra mix 2 so what we're gonna

617
00:59:11,500 --> 00:59:15,780
do is we're actually gonna have Loki play some of these songs on air and he's

618
00:59:15,780 --> 00:59:20,480
going to give us his feedback to the steps to these songs live as he dances

619
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:23,460
to them this is our excuse because they think I'm too fat and so they said you

620
00:59:23,460 --> 00:59:27,900
got to work yeah I got to exercise Loki has to dance because he is the pudgiest

621
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:35,820
hey that's not fair it's it's the bacon is basically what it is yes all right so

622
00:59:35,820 --> 00:59:39,980
what we're gonna do don't we weren't able to set this up to do on Xbox Live

623
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:44,860
huh because we have our well do it you want to set it up on X now

624
00:59:44,860 --> 00:59:47,360
Nah, we'll take you on to get an opponent. Forget it.

625
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:48,360
Forget it. Alright.

626
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:51,360
Let's bring in the ultimate two sounds.

627
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
Ooh, Johnny, Johnny.

628
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:53,360
Ooh, yay.

629
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:54,360
Alright.

630
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:56,360
You gotta find a song from Song Pack 9.

631
00:59:56,360 --> 00:59:57,360
Alright.

632
00:59:57,360 --> 01:00:00,360
But don't you dare play Forever Sunshine because I hate that crap.

633
01:00:00,360 --> 01:00:01,360
Gotcha.

634
01:00:01,360 --> 01:00:05,360
Pick a skill level.

635
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:11,360
Now you can see the steps and the background live on cam.

636
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:15,920

01:00:35,880 --> 01:00:39,800
okay

648
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:43,240

649
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,560

do jelly kiss do jelly kiss warm-up all right all right

651
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:51,360
supply for you to get back

652
01:00:51,360 --> 01:00:54,160
well you know if you don't know that it's been a little while since you

653
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,360
played

654
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,440
all right

655
01:00:58,440 --> 01:00:59,480
program like this

656
01:00:59,480 --> 01:01:00,800
actually i was going to get it

657
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:04,040
you got him with the mic with the mike oh i'll be in my opinion that the

658
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:15,040
Well, for a five-footer, I mean, there's not much to expect of this one.

659
01:01:15,040 --> 01:01:28,040
That's five on heavy. It's pretty bad.

660
01:01:28,040 --> 01:01:32,040
It's kind of hard for a five-footer. It's got like offbeat notes and everything.

661
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:43,040
Look at the duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh. It's like kind of like fast stuff.

662
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:46,040
This guy seems kind of hard for a five to me. I don't know what to say.

663
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:47,040
Uh, it would be different like a six.

664
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:53,040
If our listeners are watching the webcam on orangehomegordo.com, they can get a pretty good view of us and stuff.

665
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:54,040
Absolutely.

666
01:01:54,040 --> 01:02:00,040
And just so you know, yes, my colors are all screwed up on the notes. I'll tell you why I do that after Logie finishes.

667
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:06,040
It's my way of kind of like getting an edge up on Xbox Live when I play.

668
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:07,040
Cheater!

669
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:10,040
I'm not a cheater, I'm just exploiting something in the game.

670
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:34,760
this is not a five i'm sorry that is not a five

671
01:02:34,760 --> 01:02:49,840
7 maybe. But then again I can't really judge song difficulty anymore because like I'm out

672
01:02:49,840 --> 01:02:55,520
of shape. This plays about like a 7. Okay how many calories would you say you burn on

673
01:02:55,520 --> 01:03:03,120
that one? Oh no. I can tell you. Okay 40. Okay let's see. Let's see what kind of grade

674
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:08,800
Loki got on that one. Let's see, 37 great. I'd say that's about a C. Oh, he got an A!

675
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:13,800
I guess I rock. Good job. Alright. Okay, so what'd you think of those steps? Eh, they're

676
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:19,360
okay. They look kinda fun except that you know I hate free stuff. Alright, now you gotta

677
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:23,920
do the cata. Do disable the flog. Oh god. Here, I'll hold the microphone. Alright. No,

678
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:27,600
make him hold the mic while he does it. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want him to trip.

679
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:33,680
i want to be back i don't know how old i don't live

680
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,560
there will all of the court

681
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,360
i promise

682
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,080
that you on fire in general

683
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:40,000
i hate you

684
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:40,880
will launch that

685
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:45,640
you know

686
01:03:45,640 --> 01:03:52,640
What, this song's only like a minute ten.

687
01:03:56,320 --> 01:03:58,480
Whew!

688
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:02,360
Don't fail. You're on the internet right now. They'll all know if you fail this crap.

689
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:09,360
Shut up!

690
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:14,560
Whew! Cool damn break.

691
01:04:14,560 --> 01:04:20,480
I gotta cut up some slack on this mic cord.

692
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:23,480
Oh my gosh.

693
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:26,640
Oh man.

694
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:32,200
This is like classic Cata stuff.

695
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:37,240
I love this song though. This is like a real gem in this song. I would say this is my favorite song in this song.

696
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:41,040
Yeah, I know, I actually saw the gem on this one.

697
01:04:41,040 --> 01:04:43,040
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

698
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:45,040
Hey, he's just got a...

699
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:47,040
You're turning around now!

700
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:49,040
Thank god. Good job!

701
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,040
I am so out of shape, I really need to go back and play.

702
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:53,040
What'd you think of those steps?

703
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,040
Is it a worthy download?

704
01:04:57,040 --> 01:04:59,040
You got a D.

705
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,040
Shut up!

706
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:03,040
D for the bum-ass.

707
01:05:03,040 --> 01:05:05,040
Okay.

708
01:05:05,040 --> 01:05:07,040
I would say, if you're out of shape like me,

709
01:05:07,040 --> 01:05:09,040
don't play the cat that's on a patch.

710
01:05:09,040 --> 01:05:13,040
Would you spend $5 for that? I'm going to turn down the Ultramix music there.

711
01:05:13,040 --> 01:05:15,040
Yeah, I would.

712
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:18,040
Um, really, they're kind of stretching for songs now.

713
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,040
Ooh, your D is on the webcam, too.

714
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:23,040
All right.

715
01:05:23,040 --> 01:05:25,040
I'm done, man.

716
01:05:25,040 --> 01:05:29,040
All right, you're done? You sure you don't want to do one Forever Sunshine, Jamie, for us?

717
01:05:29,040 --> 01:05:31,040
I'll do it.

718
01:05:31,040 --> 01:05:34,040
I'm trying to get Jamie to get up there.

719
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:39,040
No, no, I'm sorry, don't play Forever Sunshine, I was totally kidding, I hate that song.

720
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:43,040
No, if you play Forever Sunshine, I will cut off your ankles.

721
01:05:43,040 --> 01:05:44,040
Anyways.

722
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:45,040
I like Ogia.

723
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:46,040
Alright.

724
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:50,040
I would have to say, um, yeah, it's worth a download.

725
01:05:50,040 --> 01:05:52,040
I mean, the steps are pretty good.

726
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:59,040
They weren't retarded, like, say, you know, um, was it, uh, Outer Limits or anything like

727
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,040
that, where it's just ridiculous, like, fast and stuff?

728
01:06:01,040 --> 01:06:04,920
it's able to fly ahead steps sort of like your old school cat is where it's a

729
01:06:04,920 --> 01:06:10,200
long run of eighth notes and stuff like that pretty good alright sounds good now

730
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,680
for those of you guys that are wondering why the hell does it show the red notes

731
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,840
and blue notes and yellow notes why doesn't it look right because actually

732
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:21,520
the way my system is set up on the Xbox I actually have it set to show the notes

733
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:25,600
the different colors on purpose because the reason why I do that is so that when

734
01:06:25,600 --> 01:06:29,280
I go on Xbox live it shows up that way and it makes it so much easier to read

735
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:33,800
the notes, because you really can't change things when you play on Xbox Live, so.

736
01:06:33,800 --> 01:06:35,760
What other songs came out in that song pack?

737
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,640
Oh, Gia, I like that one.

738
01:06:38,640 --> 01:06:41,080
What is that?

739
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:43,080
This is Guitar Breaks, I think?

740
01:06:43,080 --> 01:06:46,160
Yeah, this is originally from Guitar Breaks.

741
01:06:46,160 --> 01:06:54,840
Okay, and then we've got Regret, which is, what was that?

742
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:58,520
I think, okay, well, Regret I think was Beatmania, wasn't it?

743
01:06:58,520 --> 01:07:02,360
And then we have Jelly Kiss from 2DX 7th, I believe.

744
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:06,640
And then we've got Disabled, The Flaw, which is Beatmania.

745
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,680
Beatmania and I think Poppy Music.

746
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:13,840
And then Forever Sunshine, which is Max 2, and everyone remembers that song for being

747
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:15,880
so awful.

748
01:07:15,880 --> 01:07:18,680
Huh?

749
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:19,800
I think pretty good.

750
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:21,240
For five bucks and me, you can't beat it.

751
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:22,240
I mean, come on.

752
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,440
Just download it, wait for the next pack.

753
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:27,160
It's better than some of the other song packs they put out not that long ago.

754
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:28,160
Exactly.

755
01:07:28,160 --> 01:07:34,160
Just as long as we don't get a whole song pack of mixes of Let Them Move, then it's not too bad.

756
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:39,160
Okay, so, I don't know. Are we gonna do one more, or...?

757
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,160
Sure, why not.

758
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:42,160
Alright, one more. Do Oh Yeah! I like that one.

759
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,160
Okay.

760
01:07:43,160 --> 01:07:48,160
Alright. Let's bring up the Ultra Mix 2 music again.

761
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:53,160
I like this song, I'm sorry. Done by Assmat and Emi.

762
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,160
Ready? Here we go!

763
01:07:55,160 --> 01:08:02,160
From what I remember about this song, it's just one constant stream of notes, really.

764
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:19,160
It looks like they actually put in new background videos in some of this, which I think is kinda cool.

765
01:08:19,160 --> 01:08:25,160
Or at least background videos we haven't really seen before.

766
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:45,720
I like this song because it's different for DDR like you're like what the heck is this

767
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:47,720
It's like Bollywood or something.

768
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:52,720
Maybe it's because of some type of in-cab music.

769
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,720
Just dance to the beat!

770
01:08:57,720 --> 01:08:58,720
Don't die!

771
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:00,720
I love those run- I love those cheap runs.

772
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,720
Oh, dude! Loki's like hecka sweating, look at that.

773
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,720
This is called out of the-

774
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,720
Dance, monkey, dance!

775
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:20,720
When we bring the webcam back up, I want to zoom in on Loki's sweat to show what a workout he's getting there.

776
01:09:20,720 --> 01:09:23,720
Oh man, my legs feel like weights.

777
01:09:23,720 --> 01:09:26,720
I could play something, but I don't want to play any of those songs.

778
01:09:26,720 --> 01:09:29,720
This one's still being very fun to me.

779
01:09:29,720 --> 01:09:31,720
You want to do something from Song Pack 8?

780
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,720
No.

781
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:37,720
Alright, Jamie, come on, show us how to do it.

782
01:09:37,720 --> 01:09:49,720
The chat room is suggesting you do a freestyle to this one.

783
01:09:49,720 --> 01:09:51,720
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle.

784
01:09:51,720 --> 01:09:54,720
Chat room, love y'all but y'all suck.

785
01:09:54,720 --> 01:10:02,720
By the way, she got a D. Another D.

786
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:05,720
Jamie's here to pretty up the photo op.

787
01:10:10,720 --> 01:10:13,720
Not really much, though, because Loki's a damn sexy man.

788
01:10:13,720 --> 01:10:15,720
I know.

789
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:18,720
I need to play some more.

790
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,720
Do one of the regular Ultramix 2 songs.

791
01:10:20,720 --> 01:10:23,720
I can see you dancing your dance.

792
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,720
I'm fine.

793
01:10:30,720 --> 01:10:34,860
Now that's that's the picture to get the agony of defeat

794
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:56,320
It's because you're an American or like I'm in heaven or close your eyes or skulk or something

795
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:02,320
Ooh, there's a song called Gyruss. That's totally sweet.

796
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,320
It's a remix of the Gyruss theme from Dude. It's awesome.

797
01:11:12,320 --> 01:11:16,320
Jimmy's apologizing it's taking her so long to pick a song, but she's just kind of picky.

798
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,320
Four weeks later.

799
01:11:18,320 --> 01:11:24,320
By the way, we hardly ever actually play DDR on the show, so this is a rare opportunity for you guys.

800
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,320
still in time? As if you can't tell by the wheezing. I play a lot of DDR. Oh yeah, oh

801
01:11:31,940 --> 01:11:38,940
yeah, come on. Come on, come on. Ooh. Um, hold down B. No, I lied, hit A. And this time hold

802
01:12:08,940 --> 01:12:15,940
her thoughts on Chasmic Cowgirl. She says she hasn't played DDR in a month.

803
01:12:24,540 --> 01:12:31,540
She is making it look good with so many crepes, I'm perfect.

804
01:12:31,540 --> 01:12:38,540
I used to love this song when it was in Guitar Freaks.

805
01:12:39,540 --> 01:12:45,540
Yeah, I was just thinking, man, this makes me want to play Guitar Freaks. Do you guys have Guitar Freaks?

806
01:12:46,540 --> 01:12:47,540
No, sadly not here.

807
01:12:48,540 --> 01:12:50,540
Damn, I should have brought mine.

808
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:54,540
You gotta shake in our butts now, Mr. DJ.

809
01:12:54,540 --> 01:12:57,540
You do gotta shake on our butts now, Mr. DJ.

810
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,540
Okay, well she just has to go and show me up now.

811
01:13:07,540 --> 01:13:08,540
That's no fair.

812
01:13:12,540 --> 01:13:14,540
That's because she's more in shape than I am.

813
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,540
Yeah, she's been preparing for that mud run, so you know she's got the stamina for this.

814
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:24,540
I've been preparing for a Big Mac

815
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:28,940
Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and get this

816
01:13:28,940 --> 01:13:32,040
sesame seed bun baby

817
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:39,040
too much burger for one man to handle

818
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:49,040
Yay! All right, what did you think?

819
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:56,040
Okay, so that, you know, they have an eight for the...

820
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:57,040
Show us your moves!

821
01:13:57,040 --> 01:14:00,040
And a five for...

822
01:14:00,040 --> 01:14:06,040
The verdict is a B. She got a slightly better score than Loki. Thank you.

823
01:14:06,040 --> 01:14:08,040
because he said something that made me laugh.

824
01:14:08,040 --> 01:14:10,040
It was a new high score.

825
01:14:10,040 --> 01:14:13,040
I broke someone's score.

826
01:14:13,040 --> 01:14:15,040
Alright, so what did you think of that?

827
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,040
Get your chair back.

828
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:19,040
Fun?

829
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:20,040
Yeah, pretty fun.

830
01:14:20,040 --> 01:14:21,040
Alright.

831
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:23,040
I need to start doing DDR again.

832
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:25,040
Alright.

833
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:29,040
Because the ironic thing is, even though we talk about these music games a whole lot here on the station,

834
01:14:29,040 --> 01:14:31,040
we haven't played them in quite a while.

835
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:33,040
No.

836
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:35,960
So hey, I played step mania, but yeah, that's with my hand

837
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:41,160
I played the control I played the button button revolution and I now know why people don't exercise in jeans

838
01:14:41,240 --> 01:14:44,320
All right. Anyway, can we go? Can we go back to radio? All right

839
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:48,280
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and open up the skype line

840
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:51,720
For those of you guys that have any feedback you want to talk about 2dx

841
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:54,760
Night style you want to talk about what else is going on in the scene?

842
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:58,400
We were talking a little bit about a bawani tournaments going on earlier

843
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:05,400
And if you have any feedback on UltraMix 2 and the performance of Dark Sakura and Loki, we certainly would love to hear that as well.

844
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:10,400
So, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call.

845
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,400
Again, to do that, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

846
01:15:18,400 --> 01:15:19,400
Alright, let's go ahead, we got one coming in.

847
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:20,400
If you dare.

848
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,400
Alright.

849
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,400
Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

850
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:26,400
Ledger Zaku here.

851
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:27,400
Hello Zaku, how you doing?

852
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:38,400
As always, I'm just coming back from Spring Break and managing to play 2DX 10th style, unfortunately.

853
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:41,400
Wait, you did get to play 2DX 10th style?

854
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:44,400
It was kind of like, yeah.

855
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:50,400
Yes, because, you know, Long Island, not far from the city, has a place that has 2DX 10th.

856
01:15:50,400 --> 01:15:56,400
And I managed to travel out there by bus a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday.

857
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:58,400
Getting on the bus to go nerd it up, huh?

858
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,400
fun.

859
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,400
Anyway.

860
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:34,100
Yeah, I was whoring that up too, but I mean, tense style, I mean, okay, I think I see the

861
01:16:34,100 --> 01:16:38,300
changes for the fact that the timing is just, you know, especially for new people that are

862
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:39,920
trying to, like, struggle.

863
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:41,440
Did you play in towel mode?

864
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:46,520
No, I mean, I saw other folks playing in towel, but that's about it.

865
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:50,120
I mean, I saw other folks breaking out the towel and putting it on there, but...

866
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,900
I can't play without the towel.

867
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:59,500
But anyways, you know, I'm hearing word that 2DX12 Happy Sky is going up for location tests.

868
01:16:59,500 --> 01:17:00,500
Oh, yes.

869
01:17:00,500 --> 01:17:01,500
That name is so...

870
01:17:01,500 --> 01:17:06,100
You repeat us to it, we were going to talk about that a little bit later, but yes, they've

871
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:10,340
announced 2DX12 style, also known as Happy Sky.

872
01:17:10,340 --> 01:17:13,100
Which is ironic when you consider what my online name is, Sky.

873
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,100
Happy Sky!

874
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,100
That made you Happy Sky.

875
01:17:15,100 --> 01:17:16,100
I'm so happy!

876
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,100
I'm happy that this game's coming.

877
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:21,980
At this point, I mean, we managed to get the upgrade in that place that managed to get

878
01:17:21,980 --> 01:17:22,980
test style.

879
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:27,680
See, it was originally 9th, but late last year they managed to go up to 10th, seeing

880
01:17:27,680 --> 01:17:32,380
that they got the 2DX machine earlier last year.

881
01:17:32,380 --> 01:17:40,280
So I'm assuming that, according to the thread, once I mentioned 12th, that they'll try to

882
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:46,300
plan to just go after getting that upgrade kit, the same way they did for 10th.

883
01:17:46,300 --> 01:17:48,900
That surprises when we managed to get 10th, you know?

884
01:17:48,900 --> 01:17:53,300
Okay. Well, you know what, Zaku, I have a question for you on a totally unrelated subject.

885
01:17:53,300 --> 01:17:57,180
I know you probably called in to talk about that, but I know you call us quite a bit when

886
01:17:57,180 --> 01:18:00,100
you want to talk about what's going on on the East Coast and what's going on in the

887
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:03,020
tournament scene. Did you hear what we were talking about with the West Coast March Madness

888
01:18:03,020 --> 01:18:07,140
tournament that just happened? What's up with that? Why are the tournaments declining? Is

889
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,620
it just us and California, or is it happening to you guys in New York as well?

890
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:14,220
It really depends, because in our area, I mean, we're having tournaments. We're about

891
01:18:14,220 --> 01:18:19,940
to have a big tournament, hopefully in April, next month in Albany. We already had a slew

892
01:18:19,940 --> 01:18:25,060
of smaller low level tournaments, one of which almost ended up in fighting as I told you

893
01:18:25,060 --> 01:18:28,820
last time. Yeah, yeah, I remember that. With the drama? Well there's one reason why you

894
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:32,800
don't have the... No, but I mean that was because of the locals who basically acted

895
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:38,740
like assholes, and basically started disrespecting other outsiders, outside players who were

896
01:18:38,740 --> 01:18:43,540
beating them to it. So what do you think is causing the decline here then? It's not really

897
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:46,220
that much of a decline, it really depends on where you go.

898
01:18:46,220 --> 01:18:48,180
I mean it depends on where scene thrives.

899
01:18:48,180 --> 01:18:50,100
I can understand where Northern California...

900
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:51,800
You know, I can understand your guns....

901
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:55,060
your scene over there because it's striving for something new,

902
01:18:55,060 --> 01:18:56,260
like In the Groove.

903
01:18:56,260 --> 01:18:58,580
I think you know, I think you're on the verge,

904
01:18:58,580 --> 01:19:01,500
I think in my honest opinion you're on the verge of just switching

905
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:03,440
on to more In the Groove tournaments.

906
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:04,780
That's why I'm seeing California going.

907
01:19:04,780 --> 01:19:07,140
I don't know how I feel about that though to be honest.

908
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:08,720
I don't know how I feel about In the Groove.

909
01:19:08,720 --> 01:19:11,720
Umm...

910
01:19:11,720 --> 01:19:16,240
the freestyle part of it. Yeah, that's the problem. In the group, the group was made

911
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:21,400
for Perfect Attack Tournament. The East Coast already held in the group tournaments and

912
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:28,080
made it on the break late last year. And it was a pretty good turnout. I don't know. It

913
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:32,880
doesn't seem like the game's really that... You're always hearing about the thing... It

914
01:19:32,880 --> 01:19:39,880
may be. I know it was built for basically DDR on crack because of the fact that it's

915
01:19:39,880 --> 01:19:41,800
going to be on 10 foot and 10 feet.

916
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,840
Wait, I mean, you're talking like 10 footers, 12 of 13.

917
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,160
In the groove.

918
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:47,660
Well said.

919
01:19:47,660 --> 01:19:49,960
In the groove is basically, in the groove in a nutshell

920
01:19:49,960 --> 01:19:51,400
is DDR on crack.

921
01:19:51,400 --> 01:19:52,120
That's what it is.

922
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:57,000
In the groove in a nutshell is DDR on crap.

923
01:19:57,000 --> 01:19:59,400
But wait till in the groove two comes out, and then you know

924
01:19:59,400 --> 01:20:01,640
they're going to start thinking.

925
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,780
Because, you know what, I've been warming up to in the groove.

926
01:20:04,780 --> 01:20:07,320
I honestly cannot knock the game.

927
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:08,740
No, you've become de-wamp-ed guys.

928
01:20:08,740 --> 01:20:12,380
Pretty good. I mean, you know, the tournament scene is still there

929
01:20:12,380 --> 01:20:16,100
It's just you know, it needs something good and he's something new to go on

930
01:20:19,820 --> 01:20:26,580
We were so grateful of managing to pull off a Nationals tournament last year and that created it that got a big turnout

931
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,460
Not only that we managed to expose DDR to a lot of things

932
01:20:29,460 --> 01:20:34,260
So a lot of people that probably never heard of it and we're getting DDR the limelight it deserves

933
01:20:34,260 --> 01:20:37,820
I mean, you know tournaments in fact are doing you know more

934
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:44,620
are doing, you know, more great things for, you know, it depends on where it is, though.

935
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:49,860
In case in point, this, the city, where, you know, a big, major tournament would basically

936
01:20:49,860 --> 01:20:56,420
expose more people to DDR, thus we'd be getting, you know, places such as Fuse and MTV2, you

937
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:58,860
know, basically filming us during the tournaments, and...

938
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:01,860
Well, yeah, but we have yet to see what happens with that.

939
01:21:01,860 --> 01:21:07,320
Well, they're prepared, well, from what I heard, they are preparing for this year's.

940
01:21:07,320 --> 01:21:10,320
They might do another Nationals tournament this year in October.

941
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:12,320
It's all talk until something happens.

942
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:18,320
This whole exposure thing, though, I don't think it's necessarily that good of a thing.

943
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:22,320
Yeah, but think about it. It's in New York City and you have mods such as frequency busting

944
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,320
putting foot to ass trying to help, you know, help it get out there.

945
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:30,320
You know, it's usually when something gets to be a little too popular that it starts getting...

946
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:34,320
It's not trying to be too popular. It's just trying to get it, you know, get it to people

947
01:21:34,320 --> 01:21:37,320
That way, a few more people know about it.

948
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:41,320
That's all. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.

949
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:45,320
The tournament scene thrives depending on where you're at.

950
01:21:45,320 --> 01:21:48,320
And it's basically what you make of it.

951
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:53,320
Whether or not you want to decide to pedal in the groove and in the group 2, which is coming out.

952
01:21:53,320 --> 01:21:59,320
Which could be an alternative to people we've been sucking on. Extreme for what now? Almost two and a half years?

953
01:21:59,320 --> 01:22:02,320
Well, we will see. That's really all we can say right now.

01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:06,880

959
01:22:27,640 --> 01:22:29,640
It'll at least be a jar.

01:22:29,640 --> 01:22:31,640
Okay, I've still got, I've got to try it, you know.

961
01:22:31,640 --> 01:22:32,140
Alright.

962
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:33,640
Alright, Zaku, have a good one, buddy.

963
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:34,140
Alright, take care.

964
01:22:34,140 --> 01:22:34,640
Take care.

965
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:35,140
Later.

966
01:22:35,140 --> 01:22:36,640
Alright, let's take another call.

967
01:22:36,640 --> 01:22:37,640
Let's go to this one.

968
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:39,640
If I can get this here.

969
01:22:39,640 --> 01:22:41,640
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

970
01:22:41,640 --> 01:22:43,640
Merging from the shadows of Bamani style.

971
01:22:43,640 --> 01:22:47,640
Here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarklineXVI.

972
01:22:47,640 --> 01:22:49,640
Hello, our resident 2DX bastard.

973
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,640
What's on your mind?

974
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:54,640
Well, I've already, I finally got my copy of 2DX Night Style.

975
01:22:54,640 --> 01:22:56,640
Hurrah, what do you think?

976
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,040
Yeah, it's really good.

977
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,640
Did you get the one with all the stickers?

978
01:23:00,140 --> 01:23:02,740
Well, I don't have a sticker. I only have the regular edition.

979
01:23:03,540 --> 01:23:05,540
I want all the DVDs and the stickers.

980
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:07,540
So what are your thoughts? Tell us what you think.

981
01:23:08,140 --> 01:23:11,540
It's really good, actually. It's almost like in the arcade version.

982
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:12,540
Uh-oh.

983
01:23:13,040 --> 01:23:14,040
Wait, what about the timing?

984
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:15,240
We have to talk about the timing.

985
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:16,940
Specifically, not the timing.

986
01:23:17,440 --> 01:23:18,640
They think the timing's okay?

987
01:23:18,940 --> 01:23:20,440
The timing is okay, actually.

988
01:23:20,540 --> 01:23:21,140
I need mine.

989
01:23:21,640 --> 01:23:22,840
Well, it's gonna be probably-

990
01:23:22,840 --> 01:23:24,540
What was the deciding factor of the timing?

991
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:25,040
Guys.

992
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:32,040
I was going to say, because with the arcade there, of course you're upgrading the hardware and stuff, so you've got the timing issues for that.

993
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:37,040
But with the home versions, it's pretty much just, you know, to rescan it, throw new songs in, you're done.

994
01:23:37,040 --> 01:23:39,040
So that's pretty much all for that.

995
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:45,040
So of course, timing should be right on, compared with some of the other ones, it should be just fine.

996
01:23:45,040 --> 01:23:49,040
So anyways, you enjoy it?

997
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,040
Yeah, of course I do enjoy it.

998
01:23:51,040 --> 01:23:53,040
Hey Sky, remember the videos that I sent you?

999
01:23:53,040 --> 01:23:58,500
Yes, I was gonna ask you kids you sent me actually one of your you know videos where you actually hooked it up

1000
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:04,780
So you're playing 2dx and you can see you actually like you were playing love shine and you see the notes falling

1001
01:24:04,780 --> 01:24:06,780
I didn't play love love shine

1002
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:12,080
Right. It's a new top vision video and use but you set it up in your house so that you we can see your

1003
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:17,280
Fingers playing the song instead of the typical video. How'd you set that up? That's pretty cool

1004
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,180
Yeah, you know I use that, you know

1005
01:24:19,180 --> 01:24:23,180
I use a tripod, I use a camcorder, and then I use my PC as my monitor.

1006
01:24:25,180 --> 01:24:31,180
Speaking of which, I'm gonna send you a link of what my setting looks like.

1007
01:24:31,180 --> 01:24:35,180
Alright, put that on our chatroom, www.orangelaunchradio.com, clicking on chat.

1008
01:24:35,180 --> 01:24:39,180
Go ahead and slap that up in our chatroom so our folks there can check it out, the link.

1009
01:24:39,180 --> 01:24:42,180
Yeah, this is what my setup looks like.

1010
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:47,180
Okay, now do you have a site where we can actually download the Tatsujin videos for those that want to see what this looks like?

1011
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:50,780
Are you going to throw them on Bomani style like everyone else that does Tatsujin videos?

1012
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:52,940
Well, mine is different, so...

1013
01:24:52,940 --> 01:24:55,380
I got it from DustBacon.

1014
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,500
Are you really made out of iron?

1015
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,540
Haha, that's true.

1016
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:03,620
There's a difference between Tatsujin and Tetsujin.

1017
01:25:03,620 --> 01:25:06,820
Oh, sorry.

1018
01:25:06,820 --> 01:25:13,700
I got told. Here's the link for my Tatsujin videos, as well as the Seastar player and others.

1019
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:15,280
Alright, right on.

1020
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:21,920
And let me log into my photo bucket so I can give you the link to what my setup looks like.

1021
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,640
While you're doing that, what would you say would be your favorite of the new consumer

1022
01:25:25,640 --> 01:25:27,280
songs that are in 9th Style?

1023
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:32,320
Well my favorite, here's a correction, it's not photogenic, it's photogenic.

1024
01:25:32,320 --> 01:25:33,940
Oh my bad.

1025
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:36,400
I read it quickly.

1026
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,400
It's photogenic.

1027
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:38,400
Okay, photogenic.

1028
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:39,400
Yeah, my favorite.

1029
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:40,400
Is that your favorite?

1030
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:41,400
Yeah, photogenic's my favorite.

1031
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:49,400
Yeah, photogenic's my favorite. Other than that, it's also like a JÃ¤ger final attack, or a Sakuretsu JÃ¤ger dance.

1032
01:25:52,400 --> 01:25:55,400
Is it just me, or has the Denjin JÃ¤ger gone to that?

1033
01:26:00,400 --> 01:26:02,400
I do have a video. I do have a video.

1034
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,400
You're going to have to send that to me at some point so I can check it out.

1035
01:26:04,400 --> 01:26:07,400
I'll send it to you after this call.

1036
01:26:07,400 --> 01:26:09,400
Okay, sounds good.

1037
01:26:09,400 --> 01:26:12,400
Is there anything else you wanted to say, Siggy?

1038
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:14,400
Because I've got to let you go to get somebody else here on the line.

1039
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:16,400
Is there anything else you want to say?

1040
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:20,400
Nothing much else, but I'm just happy that I have my night style.

1041
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:21,400
Alright, sounds good.

1042
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:24,400
Keep us posted on any developments going on in the 2DX world.

1043
01:26:24,400 --> 01:26:27,400
Yeah, I've already sent you the link to what my settings look like.

1044
01:26:27,400 --> 01:26:29,400
Alright, sounds good.

1045
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:31,400
We'll check that out in the chat room.

1046
01:26:31,400 --> 01:26:32,640
All right, have a good one, bud.

1047
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:34,160
Later. Later.

1048
01:26:34,160 --> 01:26:40,120
All right, let's try to pick up a call here, if I can.

1049
01:26:40,120 --> 01:26:42,480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1050
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:43,800
Hey, it's Jimmy.

1051
01:26:43,800 --> 01:26:45,300
Hey, what's up?

1052
01:26:45,300 --> 01:26:46,560
Not much.

1053
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:49,960
How's it going? I got to turn down my window real quick. There we go. That's all right, yes.

1054
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:52,520
First rule of calling into radio, turn off your radio.

1055
01:26:52,520 --> 01:26:54,560
Yeah, I know how that is. All right.

1056
01:26:54,560 --> 01:26:56,600
What's up? What's on your mind?

1057
01:26:56,600 --> 01:26:57,900
I'm just

1058
01:26:57,900 --> 01:26:59,220
going off of

1059
01:26:59,220 --> 01:27:00,940
the first caller,

1060
01:27:00,940 --> 01:27:02,940
uh... i t g that right

1061
01:27:02,940 --> 01:27:05,780
way uh... tournaments are going here in socal it's

1062
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:08,860
basically all in the group there

1063
01:27:08,860 --> 01:27:11,620
what though you're saying in southern california now it's all about in the

1064
01:27:11,620 --> 01:27:12,220
group

1065
01:27:12,220 --> 01:27:15,020
yeah i don't want to read it on you

1066
01:27:15,020 --> 01:27:17,680
the first big one was in stonewood engines

1067
01:27:17,680 --> 01:27:19,260
everyone was pretty good

1068
01:27:19,260 --> 01:27:20,180
image

1069
01:27:20,180 --> 01:27:23,140
that's cuz you can see the percentages on the screen in it

1070
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:26,500
you get instant feedback while the people are playing right

1071
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:29,660
so you can have an account the great small people are going

1072
01:27:29,660 --> 01:27:40,660
Okay, so you can kind of continue to watch the scores go up, because In the Groove is one of those games where it's considered acceptable to use the scores as something that determines how well you do in the tournament.

1073
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:48,660
Yeah, because basically everyone knows exactly how the scoring system works, and it's just a good scoring system, I think, for a competition.

1074
01:27:48,660 --> 01:27:56,660
Okay, well what I have to know, I have no doubt that In the Groove is a great game for tournaments, but I have to know, freestyle. How does freestyle work?

1075
01:27:56,660 --> 01:28:00,660
I've yet to see a freestyle tournament for it. There's only been...

1076
01:28:00,660 --> 01:28:01,660
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

1077
01:28:01,660 --> 01:28:02,660
Told ya. Told ya.

1078
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:05,660
Yeah, all songs just aren't there.

1079
01:28:06,660 --> 01:28:07,660
Yeah, I know.

1080
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:13,660
I've freestyled, and I really don't think there's a whole lot of freestylable songs on ITG.

1081
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,660
Are you hoping that they fix that with ITG 2?

1082
01:28:15,660 --> 01:28:20,660
I really do. With the DDR crossovers, I guess we'll call them.

1083
01:28:20,660 --> 01:28:21,660
Like all the...

1084
01:28:21,660 --> 01:28:22,660
We'll follow the sun and...

1085
01:28:22,660 --> 01:28:23,660
Right, and the Bambi songs.

1086
01:28:23,660 --> 01:28:24,660
All that stuff.

1087
01:28:24,660 --> 01:28:29,860
Okay, all right. Well, anything else you want to share with us, my friend?

1088
01:28:29,860 --> 01:28:32,660
Um, I'm hoping to get to the X-nights style soon.

1089
01:28:32,660 --> 01:28:36,860
Yeah, we all want it, but you know, we're poor, you know, what can we say?

1090
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:41,060
But yeah, freestyle in the groove doesn't really work.

1091
01:28:41,060 --> 01:28:45,060
Hopefully they will fix that with In the Groove 2. We shall see.

1092
01:28:45,060 --> 01:28:48,260
That's what I'm hoping for. All right, thanks a lot guys. Sounds good. Have a good one, buddy.

1093
01:28:48,260 --> 01:28:53,260
You too. Later. All right, let's take one more call.

1094
01:28:53,260 --> 01:28:58,960
hi you're on orange songs radio it's the one the one it wait wait wait crap there

1098
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:22,560
Wow. Who knew? There's more than one. There's more than one.

1099
01:29:22,560 --> 01:29:24,560
What's up with that? How are you doing my friend?

1100
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:29,560
I'm doing good. We had a cosplay photo shoot in Central Park today.

1101
01:29:29,560 --> 01:29:33,560
We got kicked out.

1102
01:29:33,560 --> 01:29:40,560
Now this I have to hear about. So for those who don't know, because remember we have new listeners on tonight, what is cosplay for those who don't know?

1103
01:29:40,560 --> 01:29:47,560
cosplay or costume play, you can also make your favorite anime, video game, or manga characters at anime conventions.

1104
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:55,560
And sometimes this can be scantily clad females from fighting games, or this can be just, like, downright ugly guys from who knows what, but...

1105
01:29:55,560 --> 01:29:57,560
Or, or, you know, whatever.

1106
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:01,560
Downright ugly guys cosplaying as scantily clad females between main players.

1107
01:30:01,560 --> 01:30:02,560
Yes, I've seen that too.

1108
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:03,560
Manfay.

1109
01:30:03,560 --> 01:30:11,560
So, okay, I have to know. How did you guys, what were you guys setting up to do in Central Park and how did you get kicked out? That's what I have to know.

1110
01:30:11,560 --> 01:30:17,560
That's just it. We didn't do anything. We were just taking pictures of ourselves in costumes and stuff.

1111
01:30:17,560 --> 01:30:20,560
You were dressed up like freaks. You were freaks and the freaks have to go.

1112
01:30:20,560 --> 01:30:23,560
It was mostly hot EGL girls.

1113
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:30,560
Now, were you guys all dressing up like ghosts in a big group and having a rally and, you know, then they might have kicked you out because of that?

1114
01:30:30,560 --> 01:30:34,560
No, it was more like, you know, less than that.

1115
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:42,560
Of course, you know, whenever cosplay events in the park happen, like say in Tokyo, then a bajillion people take pictures of it and it ends up in Brutes Magazine, right?

1116
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:47,560
Right, but it was only like five people from outside that was walking around took pictures of us.

1117
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:53,560
What I'm curious about, was it the scantily clad females that got you kicked out of Central Park?

1118
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:58,560
Nope, it seems that you need a permit to take pictures in Central Park.

1119
01:30:58,560 --> 01:31:04,560
What? What? Everybody and their mother was going to Central Park to take pictures of the gates. Did they get a permit for that?

1120
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:14,560
That's just it. That's what we argued. They said because it's for commercial purposes, we need a permit. And on the weekends, we need special permission from the mayor.

1121
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,560
Oh my gosh. I say-

1122
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,560
This is for commercial purposes?

1123
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:21,560
No, this is for amateurs and for our websites.

1124
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:25,560
Oh my gosh. I say next time you're there, burn down the gates.

1125
01:31:25,560 --> 01:31:27,560
Gates are already gone.

1126
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:31,560
Damn, see? Mission accomplished!

1127
01:31:31,560 --> 01:31:35,560
They've been replaced by Ultra Kade machines.

1128
01:31:35,560 --> 01:31:39,560
You know, that's just so ridiculous. I mean, I used to do LARP

1129
01:31:39,560 --> 01:31:43,560
vampire games in Alabama, and we were just a ball kinds of insane.

1130
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:47,560
Alabama parking lot or whatever you did is slightly different

1131
01:31:47,560 --> 01:31:51,560
than Central Park. No, we would do it in downtown Mobile at Bienville Square.

1132
01:31:51,560 --> 01:31:55,560
Okay, okay. Which is... My bad. Which is a historical

1133
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:57,560
They should have told them it was for a school project.

1134
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,560
But it's a historical landmark.

1135
01:31:59,560 --> 01:32:00,560
We did.

1136
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:01,560
And we never got anything for it.

1137
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:05,560
Yeah, that's the easy excuse whenever you need to get out of something.

1138
01:32:05,560 --> 01:32:08,560
Uh, it's for a school project. We didn't know we were doing it.

1139
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,560
Not this time.

1140
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:16,560
Alright, anything going on in your gaming world you want to share with us, buddy?

1141
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:21,560
I was at the PSP release at my job. We sold 260 of them.

1142
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:22,560
Oh my gosh.

1143
01:32:22,560 --> 01:32:26,560
15 came back, and 15 came back the next day.

1144
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,560
Is that the dead pixel thing that's going on with the new PSPs?

1145
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:31,560
Mm-hmm.

1146
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:34,560
So, are they really that bad? Have you seen them?

1147
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:38,560
No. Some are, some are.

1148
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:41,560
It says we're geeks, well, we have to take a look at these things.

1149
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:44,560
We got Dan, who's actually a manager of a game, stopping town.

1150
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:46,560
It's very, very minor, and these people are too anal.

1151
01:32:46,560 --> 01:32:49,560
Hey, I got, you know what, can you send me some of those defective PSPs?

1152
01:32:49,560 --> 01:32:51,560
Because I'll take them off your hands.

1153
01:32:51,560 --> 01:32:52,560
I tried.

1154
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:53,560
I'm defective.

1155
01:32:53,560 --> 01:32:54,560
Yeah, quote, unquote, defective.

1156
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:58,520
Okay, Dan, I know you're dying to say something.

1157
01:32:58,520 --> 01:33:03,520
The people who are bitching about one or two dead pixels on their PSPs are anal-retentive

1158
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:07,280
bastards who should be shot on sight.

1159
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:08,880
No shit.

1160
01:33:08,880 --> 01:33:09,880
Thank you.

1161
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:10,880
You're welcome.

1162
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:15,920
The official line now is, we don't take them back, they gotta go to Sony if they have dead

1163
01:33:15,920 --> 01:33:16,920
pixels.

1164
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:17,920
And Sony doesn't care.

1165
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:18,920
Oh, snap.

1166
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:19,920
No, Sony does care.

1167
01:33:19,920 --> 01:33:20,920
Sony is replacing them.

1168
01:33:20,920 --> 01:33:26,920
Which is very, very decent of Sony. Basically, what you're going to get back is another dead

1169
01:33:26,920 --> 01:33:33,280
pixel PSP that they fixed. So, you know, but as for anyone who has problems with dead pixels

1170
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:39,360
on their PSP, stick with it. They'll either go away or you'll adjust. You know, out of

1171
01:33:39,360 --> 01:33:42,640
the gajillions of pixels, if one or two are dead, hey, consider yourself lucky. Some people

1172
01:33:42,640 --> 01:33:49,640
have a couple dozen. They should be mad. Yeah. 30 people. Well, you know, considering how

1173
01:33:49,640 --> 01:33:56,140
Considering how much they charge for those things, though, you think the thing would run absolutely perfectly. That's the only issue.

1174
01:33:56,140 --> 01:33:58,140
You ever bought a tire for your car?

1175
01:33:58,140 --> 01:33:58,640
Yeah.

1176
01:33:58,640 --> 01:34:00,640
Did it go flat?

1177
01:34:00,640 --> 01:34:02,140
Yeah, but they replaced it for free.

1178
01:34:02,140 --> 01:34:05,640
LCD screens have dead pixels. Sony will replace it for free.

1179
01:34:05,640 --> 01:34:06,640
Oh, alright.

1180
01:34:06,640 --> 01:34:08,640
I mean, that's it. You know, it just happens.

1181
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,640
Alright.

1182
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:13,640
So you have it lucky. We have to take them back. We have to.

1183
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,140
Where do you work?

1184
01:34:15,140 --> 01:34:16,640
Best Buy.

1185
01:34:16,640 --> 01:34:18,640
Hahahaha. Oh, I'm sorry.

1186
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,520
Not because you sell that extra insurance or whatever?

1187
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,360
Even without the extra insurance, they bring it back.

1188
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:28,320
We have to take it back, we stamp it out, devote, we send it back to the manufacturer.

1189
01:34:28,320 --> 01:34:32,400
But the thing is, Sony doesn't reimburse the manufacturer for that return.

1190
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,440
You need to take out your frustration on the multi-key machine.

1191
01:34:35,440 --> 01:34:39,960
We kind of, we get most of it back, like 85% of the value we get back, more or less.

1192
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:46,280
They won't do it with the dead pixels because they don't consider those to be a defect.

1193
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:47,600
Best Buy policy will change.

1194
01:34:47,600 --> 01:34:49,560
Right now, I think they're doing the right thing.

1195
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:54,200
I think, hey, if we had 100 extra systems in stock, and I had 10 people want to bring

1196
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,940
them back and exchange them, hey, no problem.

1197
01:34:56,940 --> 01:35:03,560
But according to Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, their whole take on it is, this is how PSPs are.

1198
01:35:03,560 --> 01:35:04,840
There's a problem with the pixels.

1199
01:35:04,840 --> 01:35:05,840
You send them to us.

1200
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:07,000
We'll take care of it.

1201
01:35:07,000 --> 01:35:08,240
Don't bother the retailer.

1202
01:35:08,240 --> 01:35:11,600
And most of the smaller retailers have said, hey, we can't take them back for that reason.

1203
01:35:11,600 --> 01:35:14,800
Isn't this supposed to be virtually invisible anyway when you're playing?

1204
01:35:14,800 --> 01:35:19,640
In game, you don't see it unless it's a solid color screen.

1205
01:35:19,640 --> 01:35:22,440
From what I was told, when you turn it off, you see the dead pixels.

1206
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:26,440
Well, yeah, and that's the thing is these people, they're not trying it for a couple

1207
01:35:26,440 --> 01:35:29,000
hours and saying, wow, this doesn't interrupt my gameplay.

1208
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,960
They turn it on on the boot up screen, see a pixel that's green when it should be white

1209
01:35:32,960 --> 01:35:33,960
and lose their minds.

1210
01:35:33,960 --> 01:35:36,640
Well, it makes sense after they just spent $250 on it.

1211
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:41,000
If they'd run the Spider-Man DVD through it, 90% of the time, the pixels unfreeze since

1212
01:35:41,000 --> 01:35:44,040
they're just frozen, not dead, and the problem fixes itself.

1213
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:48,920
oh that's weird and the thing is two months down the road you might have a

1214
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:52,920
whole different set of dead pixels because it's not like you're gonna get

1215
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:56,600
one that's gonna work forever LCD screens do that and I'm gonna have to

1216
01:35:56,600 --> 01:35:59,040
do monitor can tell you that I've heard the dead pixel thing going on with the

1217
01:35:59,040 --> 01:36:04,120
DS as well so it's not just you know PSP it's nature technology anyway we gotta

1218
01:36:04,120 --> 01:36:07,120
let you go with it we gotta let you go but but have a good one thanks for

1219
01:36:07,120 --> 01:36:11,080
calling us you got all right later I've got to take one more because this guy's

1220
01:36:11,080 --> 01:36:15,520
been calling us pretty constantly so I just want to do one more and then we're

1221
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:23,480
gonna get in the cage with you. You're so kind. I know I'm so kind. Hi you're on orange on radio. Hello.

Oh, he hung up on us, so. Go close. Alright, we tried, we tried. For those of you guys that are

1226
01:36:52,120 --> 01:36:57,160
still trying to get in, thanks, but we are gonna just come back to this later. We'll do the match

1227
01:36:57,160 --> 01:37:00,840
game, don't forget, we got that coming up a little later on, but for now we're gonna get into the

1228
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:07,860
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match. So, for those of you guys unfamiliar with the Cage Match, the way

Lounge Radio's Bumani Music Amore program.

1234
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,820
And the winner gets a break from having to pick a song.

1235
01:37:30,820 --> 01:37:36,300
That's right so Jamie it's your break because you won last week and it's Yoko Kano and

1236
01:37:36,300 --> 01:37:41,220
the song is rise now remember there's no rhyme or reason for why we picked these

1237
01:37:41,220 --> 01:37:46,060
songs it's three songs we like you pick your favorite and it goes in rotation

1238

all right so here it is you only get a clip of this song though because it

1239
01:37:50,100 --> 01:37:57,100

1240
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:38,100
I'm a soldier born to stand in this waking hell I am

1241
01:38:38,100 --> 01:38:44,100
With nothing more than I can come to you

1242
01:38:44,100 --> 01:38:51,100
Pray myself, please don't forget Life's a trade and we are friends

1243
01:38:51,100 --> 01:38:56,100
Please give me that chance to be a fool

1244
01:38:56,100 --> 01:39:03,100
People face in the fire together

1245
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:11,100
If we don't win the moon, I'll be a clown

1246
01:39:11,100 --> 01:39:18,100
Save your tears, come for the day When the pain is far behind

1247
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:25,100
On your feet, come with me There are some of you still alive

1248
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:31,100
Save your fears, take your place Save them for the judgment day

1249
01:39:31,100 --> 01:40:01,060
All right, that was the clip I made.

1250
01:40:01,060 --> 01:40:07,060
And on behalf of song number one, Yoko Kano with Rise, and now you get to hear two new songs in their entirety.

1251
01:40:07,060 --> 01:40:10,060
I'm gonna start it off with my pick for tonight's cage match.

1252
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:16,060
Now, you might remember, or you may not if this is your first time listening to Orange Commons Radio, so welcome,

1253
01:40:16,060 --> 01:40:21,060
but we've retired a couple songs from the cage match. When a song wins four times, we retire it.

1254
01:40:21,060 --> 01:40:25,060
And the first song that ever got retired was the top 40 hit.

1255
01:40:25,060 --> 01:40:27,060
It was Gwen Stefani, remember that?

1256
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:32,640
I'm gonna try I'm gonna change hey you watch it I like my Gwen okay okay so I'm

1257
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:37,200
gonna try my top 40 luck again because I love this chick I'm sorry don't roll

1258
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:45,920
your eyes at me hey that's it they don't see that they do when I get upset all

1259
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:50,520
right so anyway I'm gonna try my top 40 like well what what what what what what

1260
01:40:50,520 --> 01:40:55,560
So, we're going to do a dance remix, though, of a Top 40 hit.

1261
01:40:55,560 --> 01:40:57,560
So this is...

1262
01:40:57,560 --> 01:40:59,680
One of the stupid Haddaway songs again.

1263
01:40:59,680 --> 01:41:00,680
It's not Haddaway.

1264
01:41:00,680 --> 01:41:02,520
This is actually Kelly Clarkson.

1265
01:41:02,520 --> 01:41:03,520
Oh, God.

1266

Out of sight, out of mind

Shut your mouth, I just can't say again

1298
01:43:23,920 --> 01:43:28,920
Again and again and again and again

1309
01:44:25,080 --> 01:44:27,080
And you've been gone

1310
01:44:27,080 --> 01:44:46,280
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

1311
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:51,200
Kelly Clarkson, Since You Been Gone, the Jason Nevins Rock the Club mix.

1312
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:57,060
Let's go around and see if that rocked people up or if they're going to rock it on out of

1313
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:11,140
here let's see dark Sakura it oh no more talking for you Dan the man since you

1314
01:45:11,140 --> 01:45:16,460
have a mic Dan the man since you have a mic would you think it's been gone

1315
01:45:16,460 --> 01:45:23,260
unimpressive on scale of one to ten negative four all right Loki there is no

1316
01:45:23,260 --> 01:45:27,460
amount of alcohol in this world that make that song good that was awful I

1317
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:32,100
mean you can remix that song to hell and it would still suck so guess what it

1318
01:45:32,100 --> 01:45:37,820
gets a one because it's killing Clarkson what were you thinking no bad and you

1319
01:45:37,820 --> 01:45:42,340
flipped Matt Ross this coming from the guy who brings his girlfriend over every

1320
01:45:42,340 --> 01:45:47,700
Tuesday to watch American Idol doesn't mean I'm gonna buy any of their albums

1321
01:45:47,700 --> 01:45:55,700
Okay, I like reality TV sometimes just because I watch reality TV does not mean that I'm gonna buy the music

1322
01:45:56,220 --> 01:46:01,860
Clay Aiken is funny-looking Kelly Clarkson is a hot mama. Clay Aiken is funny-looking

1323
01:46:02,660 --> 01:46:04,460
anyway

1324
01:46:04,460 --> 01:46:06,300
All right

1325
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:12,020
I think you people who especially considering some of the DDR songs you guys like

1326
01:46:12,020 --> 01:46:15,980
need to respect Kelly a little more I give it like a nine it's it's cool I

01:47:00,980 --> 01:47:06,180
recognize him from his ever famous song a battle without honor or humanity this

1335
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:12,940
This is Frozen Memories, so I, uh, I only remember the guy's name.

1336
01:47:12,940 --> 01:47:16,580
Try Tomoyasu Hotei, how does that sound right?

1337
01:47:16,580 --> 01:47:17,580
That'd be it.

1338
01:47:17,580 --> 01:47:18,580
Alright, here it is.

1339
01:47:18,580 --> 01:47:19,580
That's enough.

1340
01:47:19,580 --> 01:47:26,580
Yamayasu Hotei with Frozen Memories, enjoy!

1341
01:47:49,580 --> 01:47:59,580
ðµ

1342
01:47:59,580 --> 01:48:09,580
ðµ

1343
01:50:39,580 --> 01:50:44,580
or

1344
01:50:44,580 --> 01:50:49,580
or

1345
01:50:49,580 --> 01:50:54,580
or

1346
01:50:54,580 --> 01:50:59,580
or

1347
01:50:59,580 --> 01:51:04,580
or

1348
01:51:04,580 --> 01:51:32,020
Okay, boys and girls, that was song number three, Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.

1349
01:51:32,020 --> 01:51:37,180
see what the folks in the room thought of frozen memories dark Sakura it was

1350
01:51:37,180 --> 01:51:47,580
not too bad but kind of generic solid seven all right angel what'd you think

1351
01:51:47,580 --> 01:51:53,740
of that I liked it eight I thought it was good but not as good as Kelly

1352
01:51:53,740 --> 01:52:01,740
Clarkson seven and a half Logie what'd you think of Tomiyasu hotte I liked it

1353
01:52:01,740 --> 01:52:13,740
It was interesting because I was very tempted to put in a battle without honor and humanity for another time because they had a battle without honor and humanity number 3 which is pretty much the same song.

1354
01:52:13,740 --> 01:52:19,740
This one sounds like it could be from an anime or some sort of video game itself so I give it an 8.

1355
01:52:19,740 --> 01:52:21,740
Alright, and Dan the Man.

1356
01:52:21,740 --> 01:52:25,740
I like the wailing guitar sound, it was totally sweet.

1357
01:52:25,740 --> 01:52:27,740
That song would rule in Guitar Freaks, it really would.

1358
01:52:27,740 --> 01:52:31,400
freaks I would rock and guitar freaks I think it definitely gets at least an

1359
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:37,480
eight maybe eight point seven two five all right totally hard sounds good okay

1360
01:52:37,480 --> 01:52:41,500
guys it's time to vote remember you have to be in our chat room to vote everything

1361
01:52:41,500 --> 01:52:45,240
we have said to this point doesn't matter because it's you guys that make

1362
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:49,280
the ultimate decision so here it is one more time song number one yoko Kano with

1363
01:52:49,280 --> 01:52:58,480

1373
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,700
different stuff with there was a photographer from a local paper that was

1374
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:02,500

1375
01:54:02,500 --> 01:54:06,300

1377
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:14,720

1378
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:18,920
like in midair doing it yeah they got that they got I saw the camera right

1379
01:54:18,920 --> 01:54:25,760
here like a couple close-up shots of me going you know what's funny is that when

1380
01:54:25,760 --> 01:54:30,720
he first showed up he thought like our whole show was us dancing while talking

1381
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:38,400
I was like you want us to dance okay dance monkey dance we're like free

1383
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:42,400
What else do you want me to do?

1384
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,400
Eh, it's cool. It works out. It's fun.

1385
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,400
Alright, anyway, finish your votes there. Send them over a private message to Sky.

1386
01:54:49,400 --> 01:54:53,400
Loki, as long as you got the microphone there. Tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.

1387
01:54:53,400 --> 01:54:58,400
Um, not too much as I posted last week. Um, still waiting for some actual sim files to come out.

1388
01:54:58,400 --> 01:55:05,400
I think, if I remember correctly, uh, there is that set-mania pack that's coming out with a bunch of songs called, uh,

1389
01:55:05,400 --> 01:55:09,700
DDR, uh, it's like XXMix or something like that.

1390
01:55:09,700 --> 01:55:17,700
Oh, there's some link on, um, there's some link on the actual, um, BemaniCell site that, um, they have there.

1391
01:55:17,700 --> 01:55:23,900
And they were saying there was gonna be an April 1st release for that, so look for that. There's a whole thread to it.

1392
01:55:23,900 --> 01:55:30,400
And, um, so that'd be pretty interesting. Other than that, um, oh, um, pretty soon.

1393
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:34,680
And DDRUK is relaunching pretty soon, should be this week actually, I think Monday or Tuesday,

1394
01:55:34,680 --> 01:55:35,680
I can't remember.

1395
01:55:35,680 --> 01:55:40,520
So they're coming back, and DDRMania X is saying that they're coming back at some point.

1396
01:55:40,520 --> 01:55:43,720
But actually, DDRUK, they are saying they're coming back, I think it's Monday, Tuesday,

1397
01:55:43,720 --> 01:55:46,520
I can't remember what exactly the day is on that.

1398
01:55:46,520 --> 01:55:50,440
But they're coming back, so look for good stuff from them.

1399
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:53,840
Sim Files, I don't really know what the situation is with Sim Files, what they're going to be

1400
01:55:53,840 --> 01:55:57,680
doing because I think the reason they got taken down the first time was because they

1401
01:55:57,680 --> 01:56:01,100
had licensed music on there and that kind of stuff.

1402
01:56:01,100 --> 01:56:02,720
So look forward to that.

1403
01:56:02,720 --> 01:56:03,800
That should be pretty exciting.

1404
01:56:03,800 --> 01:56:06,800
I'm just glad that I'll have more websites to read again.

1405
01:56:06,800 --> 01:56:11,480
And really, other than that, not too much else going on.

1406
01:56:11,480 --> 01:56:14,520
There's some sim files out there that are pretty interesting.

1407
01:56:14,520 --> 01:56:17,420
More crappy remixes, of course, out there.

1408
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:20,300
But they give me some ideas for stuff, so I may look to doing that.

1409
01:56:20,300 --> 01:56:25,600
I've been kind of hitting a musician's block lately, so I haven't been making anything.

1410
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:35,600
But yeah, lots of fun stuff out there. Go download some music, songs, of course only if you have the CD. And that's it.

1411
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:43,600
Alright. Okay, we're gonna take the last call for cage match votes now. So hopefully you guys are getting those votes in.

1412
01:56:43,600 --> 01:56:49,600
And, what we're gonna do, we're gonna take a break and we're gonna come back and play Match Game.

1413
01:56:49,600 --> 01:56:54,680
Match Game tonight has prizes. Now, we are gonna open up the Skype line. However,

1414
01:56:54,680 --> 01:56:59,140
we need one contestant on the Skype line and one contestant actually in the chat

1415
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:04,180

1416
01:57:04,180 --> 01:57:08,020
Match Game and you're in the chat room, send a message to Sky that says, Match

1418
01:57:12,260 --> 01:57:16,320

1419
01:57:16,320 --> 01:57:24,640

1435
02:02:40,540 --> 02:02:43,540
I'm

1436
02:02:43,540 --> 02:02:46,540

1437
02:02:46,540 --> 02:02:49,540

But you're sitting at home, on and on on the shelf

1443
02:03:13,940 --> 02:03:16,940
If you want to borrow less, you have to find it yourself

1444
02:03:16,940 --> 02:03:19,940
And so what I'm waiting for is someone waiting for me

1445
02:03:19,940 --> 02:03:22,940
Since summer is the place I really want to be

1446
02:03:22,940 --> 02:03:25,940
My foundation is me, but you need the right thing

1447
02:03:25,940 --> 02:03:28,940
To keep tall and tender, young and handsome, fancy thing made

1448
02:03:28,940 --> 02:03:31,940
I'll go seek out the trash, something sexy but smart

1449
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:34,940
Mark's gonna catch you as you get to the end

1450
02:03:34,940 --> 02:03:38,940
You're gonna make it easier to notice me there

1451
02:03:38,940 --> 02:03:41,940
You may not get a second line

1452
02:03:41,940 --> 02:03:45,940
Mr. Linus, I can't decide, don't you sit down

1453
02:03:45,940 --> 02:03:48,940

I need you

1455

Suddenly history is the reason you're lying

1457
02:03:55,940 --> 02:03:56,940
I am lying

1458
02:03:56,940 --> 02:03:58,940

Bye.

1656
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:23,280
I was hoping that it was a woman because I called her a her, and if it was a guy that

1657
02:20:23,280 --> 02:20:24,840
would have been really bad.

1658
02:20:24,840 --> 02:20:27,840
Are you saying she sounds like a man?

1659
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:31,680
No, I'm saying that some guys, some kids sound like women.

1660
02:20:31,680 --> 02:20:35,840
Most of our listeners are male, so it's nice to have some more females listening to the

02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:40,460
program alright let's go to a break when we come back from break we're gonna get

To the arms of a magic state

Where you can stay, where you can find yourself

1672
02:24:42,920 --> 02:24:46,920
Find yourself, lose your fear

1673
02:24:46,920 --> 02:24:48,920
Cause there is no one here

1674

If you live about something, you know

1676
02:24:52,920 --> 02:24:55,920
Give yourself and let the music take you far

1677

1693
02:27:53,120 --> 02:28:22,120
Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 137 on this Easter Sunday, March 27,

1694
02:28:22,120 --> 02:28:26,800
On what has been quite an interesting show tonight, very interesting vibe going on tonight.

1695
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:30,080
We had some good calls on the skype line a little earlier tonight.

1696
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:34,960
Actually getting out the DDR mat and playing UltraMix live on air.

1697
02:28:34,960 --> 02:28:39,120
That was very interesting and getting to rate some of the song pack 9 steps there.

1698
02:28:39,120 --> 02:28:43,400
And I've been oogling over Dan's PSP that he's playing there in the corner and I'm jealous

1699
02:28:43,400 --> 02:28:44,880
and I want to take it when he's not looking.

1700
02:28:44,880 --> 02:28:48,920
But I wouldn't do that because Dan's my bud.

1701
02:28:48,920 --> 02:28:53,260
Dan's saying over there is he's playing Lumines, he's all, I am always looking, so,

1702
02:28:53,260 --> 02:28:56,860
and I believe it. But Dan was actually telling me that they actually have PSPs

1703
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:01,940
still in his store. Very few, but a few. Which is weird because I was hearing

1704
02:29:01,940 --> 02:29:06,200
these stories about, oh my gosh, PSPs are sold out everywhere, and you can't get

1705
02:29:06,200 --> 02:29:11,840
one no matter what. Da-da-da. Yeah, Mike, Dan, get Dan a mic. Hey, Lego boy, get Dan a

1706
02:29:11,840 --> 02:29:20,680
The only reason we would have any left was because some weren't picked up by the fools

1707
02:29:20,680 --> 02:29:24,560
who laid down $50 and just decided they didn't want them.

1708
02:29:24,560 --> 02:29:25,560
$50 reserve.

1709
02:29:25,560 --> 02:29:26,560
$50 deposit.

1710
02:29:26,560 --> 02:29:27,560
Wow.

1711
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:32,960
Oh my gosh, how do people lay down $50 and then forget?

1712
02:29:32,960 --> 02:29:37,200
I mean, maybe the $5 pre-order I can see, but $50, man.

1713
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:43,540
And I think it was as of this morning, we had three available for sale, and if they're

1714
02:29:43,540 --> 02:29:49,260
still there, you know, when I come in tomorrow morning, I'll be just shocked.

1715
02:29:49,260 --> 02:29:52,620
And do you, do these people get their $50 back or no?

1716
02:29:52,620 --> 02:29:58,220
Yeah, it's, it's, a GameStop reservation is totally refundable, unlike an EB reservation

1717
02:29:58,220 --> 02:30:03,420
that they make you spin in the store because EB sucks.

1718
02:30:03,420 --> 02:30:06,140
Now we have some EB employees that listen to this show, so be nice.

1719
02:30:06,140 --> 02:30:07,140
They can suck it.

1720
02:30:07,140 --> 02:30:09,440
Nice, be nice.

1721
02:30:09,440 --> 02:30:10,440
Can't we all just get along?

1722
02:30:10,440 --> 02:30:11,440
They eat babies, you know.

1723
02:30:11,440 --> 02:30:17,080
That's what EB stands for.

1724
02:30:17,080 --> 02:30:18,560
Isn't there enough hate in this world?

1725
02:30:18,560 --> 02:30:19,560
No.

1726
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:21,320
I want to spread love here on Orange Lounge.

1727
02:30:21,320 --> 02:30:25,320
GameStop and EB should come together in harmony, and then Best Buy could join in.

1728
02:30:25,320 --> 02:30:26,520
But not Walmart.

1729
02:30:26,520 --> 02:30:27,520
Not Walmart.

1730
02:30:27,520 --> 02:30:29,080
Walmart's evil.

1731
02:30:29,080 --> 02:30:30,720
Screw EB.

1732
02:30:30,720 --> 02:30:31,720
Screw Game Crazy.

1733
02:30:31,720 --> 02:30:37,220
Don't screw with the people who work there because they suffer just like I do.

1734
02:30:37,220 --> 02:30:41,900
You know I went into a game crazy once and I know I was cheating on you Dan I'm really

1735
02:30:41,900 --> 02:30:44,980
sorry but I went into a game crazy because I was having a hard time finding UltraMix

1736
02:30:44,980 --> 02:30:49,620
2 and I went in and I said I want UltraMix 2 but not in a bundle and she's like oh we've

1737
02:30:49,620 --> 02:30:50,780
got the one here with the pad.

1738
02:30:50,780 --> 02:30:53,660
I said not in a bundle.

1739
02:30:53,660 --> 02:30:57,220
You obviously didn't come to my store where we've had ass loads of them forever.

1740
02:30:57,220 --> 02:30:58,660
I didn't.

1741
02:30:58,660 --> 02:31:01,120
As well as red octane ignition pads.

1742
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,320
But I ended up going to the GameStop of the street and I did pick up Ultramix 2 there.

1743
02:31:04,320 --> 02:31:05,820
They just didn't have it at my usual GameStop.

1744
02:31:05,820 --> 02:31:06,820
Fucking A.

1745
02:31:06,820 --> 02:31:07,820
Thank you.

1746
02:31:07,820 --> 02:31:08,820
Thank you, Dan.

1747
02:31:08,820 --> 02:31:09,820
All right.

1748
02:31:09,820 --> 02:31:16,040
We do a little segment, we're going to get into the FUs of the Week here shortly, but

1749
02:31:16,040 --> 02:31:20,080
before we get into that, we're going to get into a segment we'd like to do here on the

1750
02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:27,000
show called the, no, not FNA, we're going to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1751
02:31:27,000 --> 02:31:29,680
I know, it's the kiddies one.

1752
02:31:29,680 --> 02:31:31,680
Oh, I don't have the kiddies one, actually.

1753
02:31:31,680 --> 02:31:32,680
Look at the imaging form.

1754
02:31:32,680 --> 02:31:34,680
It's everyone posting pictures of their cat.

1755
02:31:34,680 --> 02:31:36,680
I posted Shermie.

1756
02:31:36,680 --> 02:31:38,680
No, it's not the kiddie post.

1757
02:31:38,680 --> 02:31:39,680
It's bigger than any of those cats.

1758
02:31:39,680 --> 02:31:41,680
Was there enough room on the desktop for that?

1759
02:31:41,680 --> 02:31:42,680
Oh, you need to shut up.

1760
02:31:42,680 --> 02:31:44,680
All right.

1761
02:31:44,680 --> 02:31:46,680
Those of you guys listening to Orange Launch Radio

1762
02:31:46,680 --> 02:31:47,680
for the first time, welcome.

1763
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:50,680
And DDR Freak, for those that may not know,

1764
02:31:50,680 --> 02:31:53,680
because I think some of our new listeners may be unfamiliar with DDR,

1765
02:31:53,680 --> 02:31:58,680
it's the largest website out there dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution,

1766
02:31:58,680 --> 02:32:03,000
in the video game that really started us off. Although we're about gaming in general now,

1767
02:32:03,000 --> 02:32:08,000
DDR is really what started us off. So we still show our love to DER Freak by honoring their

1768
02:32:08,000 --> 02:32:13,200
post of the week. And you know it's got a forum with what, like 50,000 users? So there's

1769
02:32:13,200 --> 02:32:20,280
always somebody interesting posting. By interesting, you mean stupid, right? Uh, I wasn't gonna

1770
02:32:20,280 --> 02:32:26,400
say that. I just, I just got a call as I see it. I actually had a hard time finding like

1771
02:32:26,400 --> 02:32:33,720
a really stupid post this week so I found a WTF post so here it is this was

1772
02:32:33,720 --> 02:32:40,940
in the DDR console games section and the subject is is anyone this desperate

1773
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:48,540
here's the message I'm am now starting to create step charts on my games that

1774
02:32:48,540 --> 02:32:54,540
aren't the right songs that go with the song like I created PS on max 300 for

1775
02:32:54,540 --> 02:33:00,020
DDR Max. I'm gonna also make Cartoon Heroes and Across the Nightmare. When I

1776
02:33:00,020 --> 02:33:04,960
do this I have the music mute or just have claps in training mode. Does anyone

1777
02:33:04,960 --> 02:33:12,620
else do this or am I just weird? Just weird. So if if I'm understanding that

1778
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:20,260
post correctly, he mutes the TV. The whole point of DDR is to dance to the song.

1779
02:33:20,260 --> 02:33:22,260
He mutes the TV and creates his own step.

1780
02:33:22,260 --> 02:33:26,260
He has step charts for songs that aren't in the game.

1781
02:33:26,260 --> 02:33:32,260
They did this a long ass time ago when The Legend of Max was coming out and stuff like that.

1782
02:33:32,260 --> 02:33:39,260
They were making, you know, like, Max on Dropout and stuff and putting the steps on there to prepare for it and stuff.

1783
02:33:39,260 --> 02:33:41,260
This has been done before.

1784
02:33:41,260 --> 02:33:48,260
I did that to an edit that I made once just to listen to it, because you remember my really

1785
02:33:49,620 --> 02:33:56,620
evil one that I did to DXY? The Another Edit? It just sounded really cool.

1786
02:34:00,020 --> 02:34:05,720
People really really badly want Cartoon Heroes and USDDR. They will go to great lengths to

1787
02:34:05,720 --> 02:34:11,600
get this song in DDR and it's just it's just a song guys it's just a song and if

1788
02:34:11,600 --> 02:34:14,560
it really means that much to you you'll pay the money get an import PlayStation

1789
02:34:14,560 --> 02:34:24,000
I don't know what to tell you all right let's um go to another segment we like

1790
02:34:24,000 --> 02:34:30,040
to do here called the F use of the week and what do we do during the F use of

1791
02:34:30,040 --> 02:34:33,680
the week we get ranty we do this every single week for you folks that are new

1792
02:34:33,680 --> 02:34:38,720
to orange lounge radio we set a bunch of people on fire yes all right so it's

1793
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:41,920
just a chance for us to kind of unload a little bit and feel better by venting um

1794
02:34:41,920 --> 02:34:47,520
so dark Sakura why is it we have to do this every single week

1795
02:34:47,520 --> 02:35:08,740
I don't really have too much in the way of angst tonight, being that I'm in a generally

1796
02:35:08,740 --> 02:35:13,340
good mood, but you know what, Rob?

1797
02:35:13,340 --> 02:35:14,340
What?

1798
02:35:14,340 --> 02:35:16,340
Big F you goes to your bathroom.

1799
02:35:16,340 --> 02:35:18,340
That's all I'm gonna say.

1800
02:35:18,340 --> 02:35:20,340
Alright.

1801
02:35:20,340 --> 02:35:22,340
Oh yeah, an idiot's on the road.

1802
02:35:22,340 --> 02:35:24,340
That's it?

1803
02:35:24,340 --> 02:35:26,340
Yeah, cause I'm in a generally good mood.

1804
02:35:26,340 --> 02:35:28,340
Wow. That's amazing.

1805
02:35:28,340 --> 02:35:30,340
Yeah.

1806
02:35:30,340 --> 02:35:32,340
Okay, well let's move on then to

1807
02:35:32,340 --> 02:35:34,340
Loki.

1808
02:35:34,340 --> 02:35:36,340
Um.

1809
02:35:36,340 --> 02:35:38,340
First off,

1810
02:35:38,340 --> 02:35:40,340
I'd like to say, um,

1811
02:35:40,340 --> 02:35:42,340
if I came at work for taking

1812
02:35:42,340 --> 02:36:11,340
taking so long to get back to me on whether or not I have this job. I understand that you're busy, like, interviewing people because they keep stealing people out of your department, but you know, I would like to know, since you promised me, like, the first week that I would know that week, and then you said, oh, they tell you this week, I meant next week, so then I waited for the next week, and then they still haven't let me know, and they suck. Uh, fuck you and my Legos, because I still can't find that goddamn piece in here. I have ten gallons of Legos, and I can't find this one damn piece, and that sucks, but I'm gonna live. Um...

1813
02:36:11,340 --> 02:36:22,340
Also, um, fuck you drivers, because there's so many bad drivers out there that are not paying attention, even though most of them seem to be women, and, um, OW!

1814
02:36:22,340 --> 02:36:28,340
Nellie gives an F you to me for saying that, and she also gives an F you to me for playing with my Legos.

1815
02:36:29,340 --> 02:36:32,340
And F you to the lack of pie, from her.

1816
02:36:33,340 --> 02:36:35,340
I'm done.

1817
02:36:35,340 --> 02:36:46,740
I'd like to give an FU to the local pizza places for not being open today.

1818
02:36:46,740 --> 02:36:50,420
I realize that it's Easter and it's a religious holiday and people are spending times with

1819
02:36:50,420 --> 02:36:56,020
their families and yada yada but I put in my time with my family this morning and you

1820
02:36:56,020 --> 02:36:59,540
know what you pizza people can do that too is put in your time in the morning and then

1821
02:36:59,540 --> 02:37:03,380
be there to make me a pizza in the evening because I'm lazy and I don't cook not even

1822
02:37:33,380 --> 02:37:40,380
a F.U. to rob for making me play the dancing game and get tired because I'm out of shape.

1823
02:37:41,620 --> 02:37:45,460
Wait until the picture shows up in the paper then he can give me an F.U.

1824
02:37:45,460 --> 02:37:52,460
And I would like to give an F.U. to having to wait to find out if I'm going to get this

1825
02:37:53,740 --> 02:37:57,860
new apartment or not because I don't like waiting. Waiting sucks.

1826
02:37:57,860 --> 02:38:03,860
Alright, let's go on to other folks and their FUs. We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

1827
02:38:03,860 --> 02:38:15,860
FU not being able to find my expansion disc for Final Fantasy XI because, I don't know, I just want to install it all at once and then, you know, do that massive patch download and then just play.

1828
02:38:15,860 --> 02:38:21,720
play I don't want to you know have to find the discs later and install them

1829
02:38:21,720 --> 02:38:27,260
and crap because no just no because that means more downloading patches later and

1830
02:38:27,260 --> 02:38:33,200
I'd rather just do it all at once Evita running out of spring break because I

1831
02:38:33,200 --> 02:38:40,560
want more but I have school this week so damn it and Evita not playing DVR more

1832
02:38:40,560 --> 02:38:44,360
because I really lost my stamina and I really want it back so that means I got

1833
02:38:44,360 --> 02:38:51,360
play more. Yeah. More to come later, bye. Does Dan the Man have any FUs? Let's hear

1834
02:38:53,240 --> 02:38:58,640
some FUs from Dan the Man. Can we get Dan the Man a mic? Logie. FUs, sorry. Do you have

1835
02:38:58,640 --> 02:39:05,640
any FUs of the week, Dan the Man? An FU to me, because I'm addicted to Lumines. An FU

1836
02:39:05,840 --> 02:39:12,480
to Rob, for making me look away from Lumines to answer this question. And an FU to Sony,

1837
02:39:12,480 --> 02:39:19,480
for shoddy quality control and dead pixels. Fix the fucking problem! Fix it! Thank you.

1838
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:28,200
You're welcome. Back to my game. Let's get to Chat Room FUs. Lezhe Zaku says, F you to

1839
02:39:33,560 --> 02:39:39,620
not being able to find a Konami 2DX controller, new or used, for around $50-$60. Well, that's

1840
02:39:39,620 --> 02:39:44,420
part of the problem. FU to oldmanwinter for making it the coldest winter ever for New

1841
02:39:44,420 --> 02:39:48,620
York. FU to my ever so shitty stamina for holding me back from playing 9-footers in

1842
02:39:48,620 --> 02:39:56,260
DDR. And FU to sucking horribly at playing 2DX in the arcades. DarkTetsuya says a continued

1843
02:39:56,260 --> 02:40:02,100
FU to G4 for killing off the screensavers. And FU to whatever corrupted my extreme US

1844
02:40:02,100 --> 02:40:09,580
data, several months of work, gone. Dark Knight says, my F.U. goes to my job for opening on

1845
02:40:09,580 --> 02:40:14,180
Easter Sunday. Know that the rest of the mall was closed, so we were the only store in the

1846
02:40:14,180 --> 02:40:21,820
mall open today and it was slooooow. SSJ100 Matt says, F.U. not being able to get into

1847
02:40:21,820 --> 02:40:27,360
the anime convention in Arizona. It turns out they only let 850 people in, thus shutting

1848
02:40:27,360 --> 02:40:35,320
out hundreds of anime fans. Wow, that is poor planning. I wasn't pissed. Shame shame. Real

1849
02:40:35,320 --> 02:40:45,600
quick, I'd like to give an F.U. to C. Herpes. I have C. Herpes. It's Herpes coming from

1850
02:40:45,600 --> 02:40:50,880
lobsters. Quit ruining the show. I'm just kidding. Uh, fs200mat also says F.U. to Golf

1851
02:40:50,880 --> 02:40:57,600
for closing the arcade the only day I have off and for Ivan Drago killing

1852
02:40:57,600 --> 02:41:07,160
Apollo Creed gotta love the never-ending Rocky movie marathon on AMC lemon-lime

1853
02:41:07,160 --> 02:41:15,280
jump says f you two websites that don't show up properly in Firefox black

the fact that it's Easter and I didn't get any candy at all are you sure

1856
02:41:23,400 --> 02:41:26,400
somebody didn't secretly give you a peanut butter cup because they'll be

1857
02:41:26,400 --> 02:41:31,920
really ticked off if they hear that DJ Tyrant says f you to spring break being

1858
02:41:31,920 --> 02:41:36,680

1862
02:41:51,940 --> 02:41:57,160
still not sending out my Lumines forcing me to play Metal Gear which is cool but can get

1863
02:41:57,160 --> 02:41:58,420
tiring.

1864
02:41:58,420 --> 02:42:02,740
And they are telling me that I'm mispronouncing Lumines, it's actually Luminous.

1865
02:42:02,740 --> 02:42:05,300
I don't care.

1866
02:42:05,300 --> 02:42:06,980
Sorry.

1867
02:42:06,980 --> 02:42:09,340
I like Lumines better.

1868
02:42:09,340 --> 02:42:10,420
Luminous.

1883
02:43:14,520 --> 02:43:22,900
MPQ says F you to myself for knowing some obscure Kanji that a lot of Japanese people

1884
02:43:22,900 --> 02:43:25,120
don't when I can't speak any Japanese.

1885
02:43:25,120 --> 02:43:29,520
F you to sampling masters mega for making a really catchy song that I can't find.

1886
02:43:29,520 --> 02:43:33,680
F you to that PSP golf game I preordered that doesn't come out until June.

1887
02:43:33,680 --> 02:43:38,840
And I guess FU did that StepMania theme for changing the pie that I was looking for.

1888
02:43:38,840 --> 02:43:39,840
P.I.?

1889
02:43:39,840 --> 02:43:40,840
Pie?

1890
02:43:40,840 --> 02:43:41,840
I don't know.

1891
02:43:41,840 --> 02:43:47,200
DJ Rama S says, Fuck you to the Parks Department for canceling our photo shoot in Central Park.

1892
02:43:47,200 --> 02:43:48,200
Permit my ass.

1893
02:43:48,200 --> 02:43:50,760
I'm sending Manfay after you.

1894
02:43:50,760 --> 02:43:52,960
Manfay, sorry.

1895
02:43:52,960 --> 02:43:58,360
John Field says, FU to being lazy and not catching up on my schoolwork.

1896
02:43:58,360 --> 02:44:04,860
Rice RYC3 says F you to Planet X slash GameStop for the longest fucking line I've been in

1897
02:44:04,860 --> 02:44:14,340
at the mall for the PSP. The end. Hi guys. And lastly, DJ Takuya says F you for not having

1898
02:44:14,340 --> 02:44:26,760
a 2DX machine in Virginia. And if I horribly mispronounce your name, my bad. Another F

1899
02:44:26,760 --> 02:44:31,960
segment bites the dust all right we're gonna do a quickie break and when we

1903
02:44:42,480 --> 02:44:49,120

1906
02:44:58,040 --> 02:45:05,040
Lounge. We'll be back.

1907
02:45:58,040 --> 02:45:59,040
Hey!

1908
02:45:59,040 --> 02:46:00,040
Hey!

1909
02:46:00,040 --> 02:46:01,040

1910
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:02,040
Hey!

1911
02:46:32,040 --> 02:46:53,040
And in the midst of all these troubles And in the midst of all these troubles

1912
02:46:53,040 --> 02:46:55,040
From books, from books, from books

1913
02:48:53,040 --> 02:49:10,640
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1914
02:49:10,640 --> 02:49:18,880
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and we want to get into some Ask Orange Lounge.

1915
02:49:18,880 --> 02:49:20,520
So I guess we're just gonna get right into it.

1916
02:49:20,520 --> 02:49:24,720
I was going to think if maybe there was another news segment we wanted to do, but eh, F the

1917
02:49:24,720 --> 02:49:25,720
news.

1918
02:49:25,720 --> 02:49:28,840
We're just going to get into some Ask Orange Lounge because we want, we want to show our

1919
02:49:28,840 --> 02:49:31,320
listeners a little love and entertain their questions.

1920
02:49:31,320 --> 02:49:35,600
So if you have a question, just head on over to orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and

1921
02:49:35,600 --> 02:49:38,720
once you get in the chatroom, just ask somebody, they'll tell you how to submit a question

1922
02:49:38,720 --> 02:49:43,200
because you already missed me putting in the chatroom how you ask questions.

1923
02:49:43,200 --> 02:49:44,200
But somebody will fill you in.

1924
02:49:44,200 --> 02:49:51,200
We have some nice people in chat.

1925
02:49:51,600 --> 02:49:53,440
Let's ask OrangeLounge

1926
02:49:53,440 --> 02:49:55,060
some stupid question.

1927
02:49:55,060 --> 02:49:58,740
What will we find out tonight on OrangeLounge Radio?

1928
02:49:58,740 --> 02:50:00,580
Something people want to know

1929
02:50:00,580 --> 02:50:02,460
is will we tone it down

1930
02:50:02,460 --> 02:50:09,460
because we got nominated broadcaster of the year and my answer is HELL NO!

1931
02:50:09,460 --> 02:50:18,900
And for those who want to know, yes, the song is supposed to suck that bad.

1932
02:50:18,900 --> 02:50:21,340
Somebody in chat actually asked me, are you guys toning it down tonight because of the

1933
02:50:21,340 --> 02:50:22,540
broadcaster of the year thing?

1934
02:50:22,540 --> 02:50:26,540
And I'm like, no, we're just kind of, I don't know.

1935
02:50:26,540 --> 02:50:28,540
It's the ham, the sedatives and the ham.

1936
02:50:28,540 --> 02:50:32,180
Yeah, actually, I think it is because we've all eaten really well today, even though we

1937
02:50:32,180 --> 02:50:34,260
did not get pie.

1938
02:50:34,260 --> 02:50:35,260
We ate very well.

1939
02:50:35,260 --> 02:50:36,260
Sorry, Nelly.

1940
02:50:36,260 --> 02:50:37,820
Don't be pouty face.

1941
02:50:37,820 --> 02:50:42,020
We've all eaten very well, so I think we're just a little happier today.

1942
02:50:42,020 --> 02:50:45,020
Nelly, please put that on cam.

1943
02:50:45,020 --> 02:50:47,220
OrangeSongsRadio.com.

1944
02:50:47,220 --> 02:50:49,580
Nelly will be showing her LEGO creations there on cam.

1945
02:50:49,580 --> 02:50:56,220
We have a lot of freaking questions to get to in very little time, so let's get to it.

1946
02:50:56,220 --> 02:51:04,380
DJ Takuya says, what are your thoughts on the flyer announcing 2DX12 Happy Sky?

1947
02:51:04,380 --> 02:51:10,060
thought is I like the name but you know what it's just a flyer I can't really

1948
02:51:10,060 --> 02:51:14,100
start forming opinions until I see like some more screenshots and some song

1949
02:51:14,100 --> 02:51:20,620
titles that's my opinion anybody else care to interject I have to say I love

1950
02:51:20,620 --> 02:51:25,340
the flyer so far I just hope the timing on the flyer is still pretty good the

1951
02:51:25,340 --> 02:51:33,740
look kickass about that flyer so goddamn versatile paperwad paper airplane little

1952
02:51:33,740 --> 02:51:42,660
like, you know, Pac-Man thing. Hat. Sailboat. Fucking kick-ass game. If the flyers is cool,

1953
02:51:42,660 --> 02:51:52,260
the game's gotta be awesome. All right. Usually, you're pretty funny. I don't know what happened

1954
02:51:52,260 --> 02:51:58,740
tonight. It is an off night, isn't it? The Legos leached his soul. I guess so. DJTakuya

1955
02:51:58,740 --> 02:52:04,740
What do you think is the future of 2DX for the console with PS3 looming in the future?

1956
02:52:04,740 --> 02:52:10,740
Me personally, I think they'll finish out with 2DX Red at least on the PS2.

1957
02:52:10,740 --> 02:52:18,740
Don't know what will happen after that though. It just kind of depends what new features they start adding into the future 2DX releases.

1958
02:52:18,740 --> 02:52:26,740
Like if we see that 2DX Happy Sky is going to be on this crazy new hardware and stuff, then I'd imagine that's where it's going to upgrade.

1959
02:52:26,740 --> 02:52:30,740
For now, I think I would continue to see it as a PS2 series.

1960
02:52:30,740 --> 02:52:32,740
Maybe that's just me. Any thoughts on that, DarkSakura?

1961
02:52:34,740 --> 02:52:39,740
I don't even want to think about the future systems until I actually have something tangible on them.

1962
02:52:39,740 --> 02:52:42,740
So speculation, I'm not going to.

1963
02:52:42,740 --> 02:52:43,740
Alright.

1964
02:52:47,740 --> 02:52:48,740
Oh, DanTheMan.

1965
02:52:48,740 --> 02:52:52,740
And remember, generally the Bimani games are real slow to adapt to new hardware.

1966
02:52:52,740 --> 02:52:59,240
since the ps3 will be backwards compatible unless they do something

1967
02:52:59,240 --> 02:53:02,700
crazy go nuts with the arcade version you can probably expect to see it

1968
02:53:02,700 --> 02:53:06,580
playable on ps2 for a good long time until they absolutely have to start

1969
02:53:06,580 --> 02:53:13,100
making it for ps3 okay good point all right let's go to a question from black

1970
02:53:13,100 --> 02:53:18,420
devler X what piece is Loki missing I downloaded the zip from the site and

1971
02:53:18,420 --> 02:53:22,140
and notice that I have a lot of the special pieces. Maybe he can describe it.

1972
02:53:22,140 --> 02:53:25,540
I don't want to hear what special pieces Loki's missing from his list.

1973
02:53:25,540 --> 02:53:29,300
Yeah, how is the Lego construction going over there? It's the one that looks like a seat,

1974
02:53:29,300 --> 02:53:34,380
and I'm on step four right now, because I've started running out of black pieces.

1975
02:53:34,380 --> 02:53:38,340
And again, for those that tuned in late tonight's show, Loki is building a charger

1976
02:53:38,340 --> 02:53:39,740
for the Nintendo DS

1977
02:53:39,740 --> 02:53:43,500
out of Legos, and that's something that's actually on the website over at

1978
02:53:43,500 --> 02:53:46,700
www.orangesontradar.com. I have a question for anyone in our chat room.

1979
02:53:46,700 --> 02:53:49,920
How do I freakin' download streaming

1980
02:53:49,920 --> 02:53:53,440
movies as to permanently non-streaming, like recording them?

1981
02:53:53,440 --> 02:53:57,840
Things driving me nuts. Send a private message over to Dark Zulker if you know the

1982
02:53:57,840 --> 02:53:59,260
answer. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

1983
02:53:59,260 --> 02:54:05,860
She'll love you forever and ever. Or send me a freakin'

1984
02:54:05,860 --> 02:54:09,240
non-streaming copy of that new video.

1985
02:54:09,240 --> 02:54:14,960
Um, let's see.

1986
02:54:14,960 --> 02:54:16,960
I'd like to make a comment about the episode 3 trailer.

1987
02:54:16,960 --> 02:54:19,960
Yes, yes, Loki, comment on episode 3 trailer since it came out.

1988
02:54:19,960 --> 02:54:23,960
There is a downloadable version out there, you just have to find it because I have it on my computer at work.

1989
02:54:23,960 --> 02:54:33,960
Alright. RPGKing7 wants to know, my question is for everyone in studio and in the chat room.

1990
02:54:33,960 --> 02:54:37,960
Can anyone give me any good cosplay websites, please?

1991
02:54:37,960 --> 02:54:42,960
I was asked for a job interview I have to cosplay a favorite movie character.

1992
02:54:42,960 --> 02:54:47,480
character hmm interesting I said that's a hell of an interview I got to say but

1993
02:54:47,480 --> 02:54:51,080

02:54:56,240 --> 02:55:00,200

1996
02:55:00,200 --> 02:55:05,040

1997
02:55:05,040 --> 02:55:10,080
that they have you know any the names of any of them one I don't know and it's

1998
02:55:10,080 --> 02:55:18,140
There's also, I think, cospa.net, or.co.jp is C-O-S-P-A, it's a Japanese cosplay site,

1999
02:55:18,140 --> 02:55:19,780
but they have individual pieces there.

2000
02:55:19,780 --> 02:55:20,780
Oh, okay.

2001
02:55:20,780 --> 02:55:21,780
You can see what they look like.

2002
02:55:21,780 --> 02:55:25,000
Um, hopefully some folks in the chatroom can help out with that, too.

2003
02:55:25,000 --> 02:55:27,900
You know, you can sometimes find costume pieces on eBay.

2004
02:55:27,900 --> 02:55:29,420
They sell everything on eBay.

2005
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:30,420
It's pretty crazy.

2006
02:55:30,420 --> 02:55:32,580
Loki, any help with the cosplay question?

2007
02:55:32,580 --> 02:55:33,580
No, I didn't.

2008
02:55:33,580 --> 02:55:35,580
Yeah, that's what I thought.

2009
02:55:35,580 --> 02:55:36,580
Alright.

2010
02:55:36,580 --> 02:55:38,580
Good luck, bud.

2011
02:55:38,580 --> 02:55:47,580
Get that job. If you're going to dress up as a movie character, dress up as, what did they call her? What was the name of the diva from the fifth element?

2012
02:55:47,580 --> 02:55:54,580
The diva. The diva, was that just her name? I thought she had a name. Dress up as her.

2013
02:55:54,580 --> 02:56:05,580
Alright, Illusion has a question. I heard a rumor that DJ Potato's company will be publishing the next frequency game. Have you heard anything about this?

2014
02:56:05,580 --> 02:56:11,100
I don't think there is a company the closest thing I think you might be

2015
02:56:11,100 --> 02:56:15,380
thinking of is neon FM and the reason why it might be getting mixed up with

2016
02:56:15,380 --> 02:56:19,140
frequency is because freeze-pop is showing up in neon FM you can look at

2017
02:56:19,140 --> 02:56:24,140
the website neon FM calm but I don't know of any frequency amplitude thing

2018
02:56:24,140 --> 02:56:27,960
that he's involved with I mean I guess anything's possible but a rumor is a

2019
02:56:27,960 --> 02:56:32,900
rumor as far as I'm concerned Loki you have anything you want to add to that I

2020
02:56:32,900 --> 02:56:35,900
I honestly didn't know you had a company.

2021
02:56:35,900 --> 02:56:38,900
Um, no, I think he's thinking the NFM to be honest.

2022
02:56:38,900 --> 02:56:40,900
So, no idea.

2023
02:56:40,900 --> 02:56:41,900
And it's definitely not frequency.

2024
02:56:41,900 --> 02:56:43,900
They're still talking about doing like a...

2025
02:56:43,900 --> 02:56:46,900
There's a petition out there for like a new frequency or amplitude game.

2026
02:56:46,900 --> 02:56:48,900
So, I don't know.

2027
02:56:48,900 --> 02:56:49,900
I read a...

2028
02:56:49,900 --> 02:56:50,900
Nothing yet.

2029
02:56:50,900 --> 02:56:54,900
I read an article where someone basically asked if they were doing it for the PSP.

2030
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:57,900
Sonny said they had no plans too.

2031
02:56:57,900 --> 02:56:59,900
So, probably not.

2032
02:56:59,900 --> 02:57:09,900
Prabha Laguna was the name of the diva. Thank you.

2033
02:57:09,900 --> 02:57:15,900
SSJ100Matt, what's a good price to whore yourself?

2034
02:57:15,900 --> 02:57:21,900
We'll answer just about anything on here. I spent all my money on the PSP this week

2035
02:57:21,900 --> 02:57:28,500
and I need money slash zenny slash gil. How are you going to get gil by being a whore?

2036
02:57:28,500 --> 02:57:30,820
Are you going to whore out your character in Final Fantasy XI?

2037
02:57:30,820 --> 02:57:32,980
I've actually seen people do this in Final Fantasy XI.

2038
02:57:32,980 --> 02:57:37,500
They play the little Taru characters, and then they'll say, we'll do the panic dance

2039
02:57:37,500 --> 02:57:41,260
for 100 Gil.

2040
02:57:41,260 --> 02:57:44,580
Which if you don't, if you've never played Final Fantasy XI, there's this little fruity

2041
02:57:44,580 --> 02:57:47,300
little dance the Tarus do when you type slash panic.

2042
02:57:47,300 --> 02:57:48,300
They go, ah, ah.

2043
02:57:48,300 --> 02:57:49,940
They do this little dance.

2044
02:57:49,940 --> 02:57:52,220
It's really cute, and people always want to see it.

2045
02:57:52,220 --> 02:57:55,100
So I suppose you could always whore the slash panic dance.

2046
02:57:55,100 --> 02:58:03,920
Otherwise, if you're going to whore yourself in real life, for the love of God, use protection.

2047
02:58:03,920 --> 02:58:06,580
Don't reproduce if you're going to be whoring yourself.

2048
02:58:06,580 --> 02:58:09,840
Honestly, don't whore yourself for a PSP.

2049
02:58:09,840 --> 02:58:10,840
It's not worth it.

2050
02:58:10,840 --> 02:58:14,020
PSPs are nice and all, but don't whore yourself for one.

2051
02:58:14,020 --> 02:58:15,020
Totally worth it.

2052
02:58:15,020 --> 02:58:16,020
Whore yourself out.

2053
02:58:16,020 --> 02:58:19,380
A buck a pop if you have to, get a PSP.

2054
02:58:19,380 --> 02:58:20,380
What's the standard?

2055
02:58:20,380 --> 02:58:22,100
50 for a BJ?

2056
02:58:22,100 --> 02:58:31,300
I think it's inflation 50 for an HJ 100 for a BJ sucky fucky five bucky you know

2057
02:58:31,300 --> 02:58:36,620
what just go on the internet and answer like a personal ad from a sugar daddy or

2058
02:58:36,620 --> 02:58:40,520
a sugar mommy maybe you might even find old lady sugar mommy depending on what

2059
02:58:40,520 --> 02:58:45,380
you're into and then you can get anything you want just by putting out

2060
02:58:45,380 --> 02:58:49,380
and you only have to put out for one person and if it is a sugar mommy

2061
02:58:49,380 --> 02:58:53,240
me chances are she doesn't have the organs to reproduce anymore they've you

2062
02:58:53,240 --> 02:58:58,040
know stopped working a while ago so you might look out why did I answer that

2063
02:58:58,040 --> 02:59:05,640
question um I'm an idiot let's see we've got a lot of questions tonight so I'm

2064
02:59:05,640 --> 02:59:10,440
trying to get through some of them here jaded 2005 wants to know my girlfriend

2065
02:59:10,440 --> 02:59:15,040
who is listening wants to know hi girlfriend who's listening wants to know

2066
02:59:15,040 --> 02:59:18,640
how did you come up with your name how do we come up with the orange launch

2067
02:59:18,640 --> 02:59:27,780
Radio name. Guilty! Yes, DarkSakura, how did that work? Basically, DDR Freak Radio was

2068
02:59:27,780 --> 02:59:33,380
taken, actually. That's why we're, no, uh. We were trying to think of Bimani sounding

2069
02:59:33,380 --> 02:59:37,860
station names, and Orange Lounge came out just because, you know, lounge music. Right,

2070
02:59:37,860 --> 02:59:44,060
right. Blah, blah, blah. Um. And we were bored on the part. You got it, and actually we started

2071
02:59:44,060 --> 02:59:47,580
about the same time the DDR Freak, we were around like just throughout the same time,

2072
02:59:47,580 --> 02:59:51,240
so it's just kind of a coincidence there. But with the whole Orange Lounge thing, I

2073
02:59:51,240 --> 02:59:54,720
think we knew that we wanted the central piece of the station to be the talk

2074
02:59:54,720 --> 02:59:58,200
program, so we were trying to think of a Bahmani-related name, because we're not tied

2075
02:59:58,200 --> 03:00:02,000
to any website or anything, so we couldn't be, you know, DDR Freak or DDR

2076
03:00:02,000 --> 03:00:05,640
Spot or Bahmani Style Radio or any of that stuff, so we had to think of something

2077
03:00:05,640 --> 03:00:08,640
independent, and since we knew we wanted to focus around the talk program, the

2078
03:00:08,640 --> 03:00:12,720
lounge name in Orange Lounge just kind of sounded appropriate, and it just

2079
03:00:12,720 --> 03:00:16,980
worked out. So we were named this because Orange Lounge has a good name, which is

2080
03:00:16,980 --> 03:00:21,300
It's really funny because now that we're getting this additional exposure because of the nominations

2081
03:00:21,300 --> 03:00:26,360
on Live 365, people think that we're our lounge music station, like we sit here and we play

2082
03:00:26,360 --> 03:00:27,360
lounge music.

2083
03:00:27,360 --> 03:00:32,000
And don't get me wrong, lounge music's pretty rad, but we're actually video game radio,

2084
03:00:32,000 --> 03:00:34,980
so it kind of throws people, they're like, whoa, I was expecting lounge music, what's

2085
03:00:34,980 --> 03:00:38,020
this geeky stuff?

2086
03:00:38,020 --> 03:00:41,180
I wish we had a more interesting story than that, but that's really just it.

2087
03:00:41,180 --> 03:00:46,500
We just picked a Bomani-related name for our show.

2088
03:00:46,500 --> 03:00:51,220
we can fit in one more question. We'll do it from Legend of Zaku, and sorry to those

2089
03:00:51,220 --> 03:00:54,620
of you guys that also submitted questions, we didn't get to them tonight. I apologize,

2090
03:00:54,620 --> 03:00:59,500
we'll get to them next week, send them in later. Legend of Zaku wants to know, so, now

2091
03:00:59,500 --> 03:01:04,220
that you're moving, and Orange Lounge Radio might have its own room, how do you plan to

2092
03:01:04,220 --> 03:01:10,380
design it? Are you going to use a ferret theme? Well, technically, it won't be just Orange

2093
03:01:10,380 --> 03:01:14,420
Lounge Radio's room, because my new roommate is not related to the station. He knows I'd

2094
03:01:14,420 --> 03:01:18,100
do it, and he thinks it's pretty funny, but he has never been on the show. That'll probably

2095
03:01:18,100 --> 03:01:23,580
change, though, once we move. But it would not be fair to make the room just Orange Lounge

2096
03:01:23,580 --> 03:01:27,340
Radio. It's going to be a computer office. But it probably will be a little bit geeky.

2097
03:01:27,340 --> 03:01:31,780
It probably will have game posters. Maybe, you know what I should do? This would be a

2098
03:01:31,780 --> 03:01:36,820
great idea. Allow the listeners to send us decorations. That way, I don't have to worry

2099
03:01:36,820 --> 03:01:39,380
about it, and people buy me stuff. I like that idea.

2100
03:01:39,380 --> 03:01:40,380
That's an excellent idea.

2101
03:01:40,380 --> 03:01:44,380
Oh, I think that's a great idea. So, the listeners will be decorating the walls of the new studio.

2102
03:01:44,380 --> 03:01:51,880
I like that idea we'll give you guys details on that later thank you and yes

2103
03:01:51,880 --> 03:01:55,540
actually the ferret will be hanging from a noose on the ceiling just high enough

2104
03:01:55,540 --> 03:02:02,080
so that dark soccer can't reach it all right that's gonna do it for tonight's

2105
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:07,600
ask orange lounge thank you guys very much for submitting your questions and

2106
03:02:07,600 --> 03:02:12,560
that's just about it for tonight's show you guys we're just about out of time

2107
03:02:12,560 --> 03:02:16,560
Thanks so much for tuning in tonight and listening. We hope you had a good time.

2108
03:02:16,560 --> 03:02:20,560
We're gonna go around now and get everybody's final thought.

2109
03:02:20,560 --> 03:02:24,560
DDR Angel, your final thought.

2110
03:02:24,560 --> 03:02:28,560
More DDR this week, please. Just kidding. I can do it on my own, I guess.

2111
03:02:28,560 --> 03:02:32,560
DanTheMan, your final thought.

2112
03:02:32,560 --> 03:02:36,560
Loki, your final thought.

2113
03:02:36,560 --> 03:02:40,560
My final thought is, I'm running out of black pieces.

2114
03:02:40,560 --> 03:02:44,560
It's almost done!

2115
03:02:44,560 --> 03:02:48,560
My final thought is,

2116
03:02:48,560 --> 03:02:52,560
I'm really craving a marshmallow peep right now. And no, I'm not going to microwave it.

2117
03:02:52,560 --> 03:02:56,560
Oh, and I get to touch the PSP. Oh.

2118
03:02:56,560 --> 03:03:00,560
So hot. I'm just going to sit over here and ogle.

2119
03:03:00,560 --> 03:03:04,560
DarkSakura, your final thought? Where are my lasers at?

2120
03:03:04,560 --> 03:03:11,040
all right you're forgetting somebody what sorry

2121
03:03:11,040 --> 03:03:15,760

2124
03:03:23,080 --> 03:03:26,200

2126

2127
03:03:33,920 --> 03:03:39,120
Also, coming to the station very soon, some big changes.

2128
03:03:39,120 --> 03:03:41,800
I know we've been saying that for like the past two months, but we're really serious,

2129
03:03:41,800 --> 03:03:44,520
so we'll let you know about that when time gets closer.

2130
03:03:44,520 --> 03:03:48,360
But for the meantime, I have a PSP to play, so we gotta end this.

2131
03:03:48,360 --> 03:03:58,440
So the final word of the show, Nellie, one word, sum it all up.

2136
03:04:46,440 --> 03:04:49,440
Six feet under

2137
03:04:49,440 --> 03:04:53,440
And I can't still hear her complain

2138
03:05:09,440 --> 03:05:12,440
She pissed so much

2139
03:05:12,440 --> 03:05:15,440
She drove me nuts

2140
03:05:15,440 --> 03:05:21,440
And now I'm happier this way, yeah

2141
03:05:21,440 --> 03:05:25,440
I knew I'd miss her

2142
03:05:25,440 --> 03:05:28,440
So I had to keep her

2143
03:05:28,440 --> 03:05:33,440
She's buried right in my backyard

2144
03:05:33,440 --> 03:05:35,440
That's right folks

2145
03:05:35,440 --> 03:05:40,440
She's buried right in my backyard

2146
03:05:40,440 --> 03:05:49,600
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
