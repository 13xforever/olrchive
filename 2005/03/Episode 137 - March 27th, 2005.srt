00:00:00,834 --> 00:00:28,491
[SPEAKER_19]: Far too easily Save your tears, cause I won't come back I could hear that you whispered as you walked through that door But still I swore to hide the pain when I turned back the pages Shouting might have been the answer

2
00:00:29,898 --> 00:00:35,383
[SPEAKER_19]: What if I cried my eyes out and begged you not to pause?

3
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:55,961
[SPEAKER_19]: But now I'm not afraid to say what's in my heart So a thousand words have never been spoken So fly to you, I'll be over the top

4
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:12,275

6
00:01:46,670 --> 00:02:05,239
[SPEAKER_19]: Dream isn't over yet, though I often say I can't forget I still relive that day, you've been there with me all the way

7
00:02:25,293 --> 00:02:47,987
[SPEAKER_19]: But still I swore to hide the doubt when I turned back the pages Anger might have been the answer What if I'd hung my head and said that I couldn't wait But now I'm strong

8
00:02:53,530 --> 00:02:55,814
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

9
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:24,929

25
00:07:29,062 --> 00:07:31,443

[SPEAKER_02]: Blame those people in Italy.

36
00:07:56,773 --> 00:08:01,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, DarkSakura, by the way, she's kind of the mother of the program.

37
00:08:01,636 --> 00:08:05,098
[SPEAKER_08]: She'll just tell it to you like it is, honestly.

38
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,759
[SPEAKER_08]: But she does it because she loves you.

39
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,440

00:08:10,582 --> 00:08:13,363

42
00:08:13,483 --> 00:08:13,503
I...

43
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:17,042
[SPEAKER_02]: I need a hysterectomy

44
00:08:39,246 --> 00:08:42,427
[SPEAKER_08]: You know I've got to ask what you're building, but we'll talk about it when we come back.

45
00:08:42,527 --> 00:08:43,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, okay.

46
00:08:43,387 --> 00:08:44,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to do it on the cam, though?

47
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:46,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Can they do it on the cam right now?

48
00:08:46,308 --> 00:08:48,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, right now I'm trying to make the mess.

49
00:08:48,328 --> 00:08:49,128
[SPEAKER_07]: Ooh, another one of those.

50
00:08:49,649 --> 00:08:52,469
[SPEAKER_07]: And I've been looking for this one piece.

51
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,549
[SPEAKER_07]: He's piece hunting right now.

52
00:08:53,569 --> 00:08:59,331
[SPEAKER_07]: I have ten gallons of Legos, and honestly, finding four pieces in ten gallons is like a needle in a haystack.

53
00:08:59,991 --> 00:09:02,691
[SPEAKER_07]: I found three of the four needles, so I just need to find the last one.

54
00:09:02,712 --> 00:09:03,332
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, sounds good.

55
00:09:03,352 --> 00:09:04,612
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find the marble and the oatmeal?

56
00:09:06,676 --> 00:09:10,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Say hello as well to our regular guest.

57
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:16,643
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can't say special guest because, I mean, damn, she's been here for like the past eight weeks, Nirvana.

58
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:17,763
[SPEAKER_08]: She's a regular guest now.

[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

63
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:23,787
[SPEAKER_03]: It's wet outside.

64
00:09:24,568 --> 00:09:31,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, it's raining here in lovely Sacramento where we based this show, but as Jamie said to me last week, you call that a storm?

65
00:09:31,553 --> 00:09:32,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Weather wimp?

69
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:38,344
[SPEAKER_04]: That was it.

70
00:09:38,725 --> 00:09:39,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't say it was horrible.

71
00:09:39,727 --> 00:09:40,288
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just wet.

72
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:42,712
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

73
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,175

[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.

89
00:10:31,816 --> 00:10:35,338

91
00:10:36,099 --> 00:10:36,379

00:21:34,022 --> 00:21:36,404
[SPEAKER_08]: To those of you that don't, happy Sunday.

153
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:37,505
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you got candy anyway.

154
00:21:38,866 --> 00:21:42,250
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here doing our thing here on Orange Lounge Radio.

155
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:44,632
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello to anybody who might be new to our program.

156
00:21:45,313 --> 00:21:46,514
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

157
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,767
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

158
00:22:20,478 --> 00:22:22,599
[SPEAKER_08]: So we went to the ceremony, and we lost.

159
00:22:23,899 --> 00:22:27,420
[SPEAKER_08]: It was a station that played porn music all day.

160
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:29,141
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a porn station.

161
00:22:29,461 --> 00:22:32,702
[SPEAKER_08]: It's certainly something you wouldn't hear on AM FM radio all day, so it makes sense.

162
00:22:34,263 --> 00:22:34,803
[SPEAKER_08]: So there was them.

163
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:38,624
[SPEAKER_08]: So this year, we got nominated for that award again, thanks to our listeners.

164
00:22:39,084 --> 00:22:39,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, guess what?

165
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:41,465
[SPEAKER_08]: We also got nominated.

166
00:22:42,766 --> 00:22:47,507
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how this happened, but we got nominated Broadcaster of the Year.

167
00:22:48,388 --> 00:22:49,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Us, Orange Lawn Radio.

168
00:22:50,086 --> 00:22:52,148
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our personal ninja to thank for that.

169
00:22:52,548 --> 00:22:56,291
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this little dorky station dedicated to video games.

170
00:22:56,511 --> 00:23:04,257
[SPEAKER_08]: Half the people on Live365 probably don't even... No, three quarters of the people on Live365 probably don't even know what DDR or Bomani is.

171
00:23:05,185 --> 00:23:05,685
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.R.

172
00:23:05,746 --> 00:23:06,666
[SPEAKER_02]: is a type of Ram.

173
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,132
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're definitely going to the awards ceremony again.

174
00:23:30,412 --> 00:23:35,096
[SPEAKER_08]: If you guys want to attend, we're going to post the information on their website.

175
00:23:36,257 --> 00:23:39,820
[SPEAKER_08]: There were not a whole lot of fans last year of stations.

176
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:47,847
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think if we were not only to go ourselves, but to get other people, like a whole little entourage to be coming to the awards ceremony too, that would kick butt.

177
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:54,072
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can come to the awards ceremony and you can watch Dark Sakura and I drink like we did last year.

178
00:23:54,092 --> 00:23:54,712
[SPEAKER_08]: So it'll be fun.

179
00:23:55,033 --> 00:23:55,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

180
00:23:56,638 --> 00:23:58,199
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to just start doing vodka shots.

181
00:23:58,219 --> 00:24:00,180
[SPEAKER_02]: That way I'll be able to stay coherent longer.

182
00:24:01,041 --> 00:24:04,543
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so actually we had a good time at the award show last year, so I'm looking forward to doing it again.

183
00:24:04,984 --> 00:24:07,766
[SPEAKER_08]: We're certainly not expecting anything.

184
00:24:07,786 --> 00:24:11,468
[SPEAKER_08]: We're nominated against some pretty powerhouse stations in Broadcaster of the Year.

185
00:24:12,889 --> 00:24:13,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Just some really good stuff.

186
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:16,532
[SPEAKER_08]: Some well-respected folks in the community.

187
00:24:16,552 --> 00:24:22,376
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a really popular rock station and a couple regular radio stations that went to the internet.

188
00:24:22,516 --> 00:24:24,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's an oldie station as well.

189
00:24:24,697 --> 00:24:25,938
[SPEAKER_08]: All really great stations.

190
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:30,080
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're just like shocked that we're even in that category.

191
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:36,022
[SPEAKER_08]: To take this station about video games and put it amongst these other four really, really great stations.

192
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:37,763
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just like, damn.

193
00:24:37,883 --> 00:24:39,084
[SPEAKER_02]: We win at the internet.

194
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:41,145
[SPEAKER_08]: We totally just won at the internet this week.

195
00:24:41,225 --> 00:24:42,525
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're very excited.

196
00:24:43,045 --> 00:24:44,786
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you guys so much for your help.

197
00:24:45,286 --> 00:24:48,808
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, if you want to vote for us, hey, we would love it.

198
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:50,029
[SPEAKER_08]: So check it out.

199
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:51,049
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a link below.

200
00:24:51,799 --> 00:25:02,205
[SPEAKER_08]: On our website, www.orangeontario.com, there's a link there where you can go and you can vote not only for the Broadcaster of the Year, but also most likely not to hear on AMFM Radio.

201
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:08,568
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we're up against the Pokemon Radio and, I don't know, there was a bunch of others.

202
00:25:08,728 --> 00:25:14,311
[SPEAKER_08]: The Pokemon one sticks out in my mind because I've played Pokemon and I have Pikachu dolls up here, so.

203
00:25:15,332 --> 00:25:16,733
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, that's kind of fun.

204
00:25:17,653 --> 00:25:19,834
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hello to those of you guys who are new to this station.

205
00:25:20,275 --> 00:25:20,995
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you enjoy it.

206
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:29,593
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the live three-hour show we do every Sunday night where we talk about not just music, video games, but really over the past two and a half years we've been doing it.

207
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:36,115
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just mutated into a show where we're just kind of sitting around, a bunch of geeks that are into video games, just talking about what's up.

208
00:25:36,475 --> 00:25:39,016
[SPEAKER_08]: So we always start off the show by doing a little segment called, How was your week?

209
00:25:39,056 --> 00:25:39,697
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your day?

210
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:41,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Where we answer that question.

211
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:41,677
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

212
00:25:41,697 --> 00:25:42,258
[SPEAKER_08]: What's going on?

213
00:25:42,318 --> 00:25:44,298
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start off with the lovely Dark Sakura.

214
00:25:44,558 --> 00:25:44,919
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

215
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:48,000
[SPEAKER_02]: My week, wow.

216
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:48,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Well...

217
00:25:48,993 --> 00:25:50,794
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't really too much going on.

218
00:25:50,834 --> 00:25:53,616
[SPEAKER_02]: I did a lot of exercise because I'm training for the Mud Run.

219
00:25:54,596 --> 00:25:57,898
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working out with Iguana Girl four to five times a week now.

220
00:26:01,641 --> 00:26:03,502
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what is the Mud Run, for those who don't know?

221
00:26:03,942 --> 00:26:08,525
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mud Run, and I'll see if I can't post something in the chat room, like a map of it.

222
00:26:09,165 --> 00:26:11,887
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a military obstacle course set up by the Marines every year.

223
00:26:12,707 --> 00:26:16,890
[SPEAKER_02]: And the Marines do a five-mile obstacle course first, and then it's open to civilians.

224
00:26:17,630 --> 00:26:18,831
[SPEAKER_02]: They've opened up a two-mile course.

225
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,819
[SPEAKER_07]: Does the winner of this mud run, do they win immunity?

226
00:26:34,539 --> 00:26:35,319
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

227
00:26:35,640 --> 00:26:43,063
[SPEAKER_02]: However, you do get a trophy, and it's a... You know how they do the bronze baby shoes?

228
00:26:43,103 --> 00:26:44,384
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a gold boot.

229
00:26:45,044 --> 00:26:47,445
[SPEAKER_07]: No bags of rice or fire for this one.

230
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,101
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and a phone call home, or a chance to go out on the boat.

231
00:26:55,082 --> 00:26:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's cool.

232
00:26:55,642 --> 00:26:56,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck with that.

233
00:26:56,723 --> 00:26:57,483
[SPEAKER_08]: Take pictures.

234
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:04,685
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to see, like, because we need to get bio pictures for the website, so we want to see a picture of you after this thing is over, just looking like hell.

235
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:06,006
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll give you a picture of bio.

236
00:27:06,426 --> 00:27:07,686
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys have to come.

237
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,506
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have to come watch.

238
00:27:08,787 --> 00:27:09,367
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll watch.

239
00:27:10,737 --> 00:27:19,644
[SPEAKER_08]: See, this is the ironic thing that DarkSakura, you know, she may sound like, you know, she's nice and sweet and all that, but damn, she's the toughest one here.

240
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:20,505
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a big chicken.

241
00:27:20,545 --> 00:27:21,946
[SPEAKER_08]: I could never do that mud run, so.

242
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:23,287
[SPEAKER_02]: I have chocolate.

243
00:27:24,328 --> 00:27:31,894
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm cheating like hell today because we went to Marie Callender's for their brunch like we do with a group of friends of mine every year.

244
00:27:32,554 --> 00:27:39,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Except there's some stupid drama going on now, so one person and then several more people didn't come because one other person was going to be there.

245
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:44,516
[SPEAKER_02]: and then some friends of ours brought their baby, which convinced me never to, no.

246
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:46,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh-uh.

247
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:47,117
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have chocolate.

248
00:27:48,477 --> 00:27:48,837
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

249
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:53,299
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday, Dan brought home his new appendage.

250
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,240
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is?

251
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,000
[SPEAKER_02]: The PSP.

252
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:56,840
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh.

253
00:27:57,380 --> 00:27:59,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I want a PSP so bad.

254
00:27:59,341 --> 00:28:00,342
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate being poor.

255
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:03,943
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I was really down on the PSP for a while, but now I'm really into it.

256
00:28:04,463 --> 00:28:06,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's got that nice wide screen on it.

257
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,365
[SPEAKER_02]: The games look so much better...

258
00:28:10,561 --> 00:28:14,464
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you're carrying around a PS2, whereas with the DS, you're carrying around an N64.

259
00:28:14,824 --> 00:28:26,874
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I really think that Sony took advantage of... Well, actually, I've heard that the PSP is about equivalent of Dreamcast power, as far as 3D is concerned.

260
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:29,631
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't played Ridge Racer then.

261
00:28:29,871 --> 00:28:34,515
[SPEAKER_08]: But the games, whatever the hardware is it runs on, the games look pretty.

262
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:40,080
[SPEAKER_08]: I did check this out because I was over at your house on Thursday as well and I was checking it out.

263
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:42,902
[SPEAKER_08]: They were playing Ridge Racer and dang, that game was pretty.

264
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:47,105
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, it was so much better looking than I remember the PSP from E3 last year.

265
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,707
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was pretty cool to see.

266
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was, oh, thank you.

267
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:52,690
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very cool.

268
00:28:53,311 --> 00:28:54,371
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very pleased with it.

269
00:28:54,732 --> 00:28:55,592
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Darkstalkers.

270
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,294
[SPEAKER_02]: My one complaint is that

271
00:28:57,822 --> 00:28:59,844
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts my left hand when I play.

272
00:29:00,344 --> 00:29:01,225
[SPEAKER_02]: That was on DarkSakura.

273
00:29:01,905 --> 00:29:03,627
[SPEAKER_02]: The analog button is so awesome on that one.

274
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:08,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you happen to notice that on the bottom left there was just this little circle?

275
00:29:08,811 --> 00:29:12,534
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally... I was too entranced looking at the visuals on the screen.

276
00:29:12,574 --> 00:29:14,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I had no time to look at the actual system.

277
00:29:14,175 --> 00:29:15,837
[SPEAKER_02]: I was looking at it going, what's that?

278
00:29:15,917 --> 00:29:18,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan's like, it's your analog stick.

279
00:29:18,719 --> 00:29:19,600
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really cool.

280
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:22,682
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really easy to look over it.

281
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:25,425
[SPEAKER_02]: At any rate, we've been...

282
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:27,702
[SPEAKER_02]: We have five games for it.

283
00:29:27,742 --> 00:29:29,603
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Wipeout Pure.

284
00:29:29,883 --> 00:29:33,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Metal Gear Solid Acid, which is a strategy game, so I'm like, eh, on it.

285
00:29:34,747 --> 00:29:37,749
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridge Racer, that puzzle game, what was it called?

286
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:38,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Lumines?

287
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,411
[SPEAKER_08]: I want that Lumines game.

288
00:29:40,451 --> 00:29:40,931
[SPEAKER_08]: How is that?

289
00:29:40,971 --> 00:29:42,993
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you play that at all?

290
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:43,893
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard Lumines.

291
00:29:44,894 --> 00:29:49,798
[SPEAKER_08]: Something that, like, if you're into the music video games, you know, because it's by the guy who did, what, Rez and all that stuff.

292
00:29:50,438 --> 00:29:53,060
[SPEAKER_08]: If you like music video games, I hear Lumines is just the poo.

293
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,061
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll give it a try this week.

294
00:29:56,141 --> 00:30:00,763
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, I really, though, me, I'm a fighting game nut.

295
00:30:00,783 --> 00:30:02,483
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to play DarkSakura, so it was really awesome.

296
00:30:03,864 --> 00:30:05,745
[SPEAKER_02]: And the sound is really good on that thing, too.

297
00:30:05,785 --> 00:30:08,186
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't sound all tinny, like some things do.

298
00:30:08,986 --> 00:30:11,327
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I should hope so, with Sony putting it out and everything.

299
00:30:12,107 --> 00:30:16,489
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, we also, though, found a webpage.

300
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:17,489
[SPEAKER_09]: Can't hear you, hon.

301
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:19,430
[SPEAKER_02]: We also found something on a webpage.

302
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:20,150
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Dan found this.

303
00:30:21,277 --> 00:30:21,657
[SPEAKER_02]: Wipeout Pure

304
00:30:42,105 --> 00:30:50,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Now I've heard that actually one big popular thing going on on the PSP right now is loading pornography on the memory sticks.

305
00:30:50,527 --> 00:30:53,567
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can have video with you to go, and of course people go straight for porn.

306
00:30:54,067 --> 00:31:01,449
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, um, they actually, we actually were looking for a one gigabyte memory stick, but they didn't have them anywhere where we went.

307
00:31:02,289 --> 00:31:03,889
[SPEAKER_02]: GameStop is supposed to be carrying them soon.

308
00:31:04,489 --> 00:31:09,530
[SPEAKER_07]: I want, if I were to get that, the first thing I'd load on, it would not be porn, it'd be robot chicken.

309
00:31:11,359 --> 00:31:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: We put some video game trailers and stuff on it.

310
00:31:14,242 --> 00:31:17,924
[SPEAKER_02]: And Dan, of course, had to have some songs on there.

311
00:31:18,565 --> 00:31:30,173
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the two songs he really likes in 2DX, which is the one from Gradius 2, Burning Heat, and Twimmy.

312
00:31:32,255 --> 00:31:35,477
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I played a whole crap load of Silent Hill 3 yesterday.

313
00:31:36,678 --> 00:31:37,559
[SPEAKER_07]: So probably next week.

314
00:31:37,659 --> 00:31:38,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I cheated so bad.

315
00:31:41,544 --> 00:32:07,477
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we went to the brunch today and I got my graphics tablet yesterday too I have a Wacom Intuos I think it's gorgeous and it's so lightweight and it's like the perfect thing so I can sit back you know sort of half in my lap and half hanging on my keyboard desk and I can just draw it's awesome so I'm trying to practice how to ink a little bit and then

316
00:32:08,004 --> 00:32:18,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I sort of feel like I've been hiding out under a rock for the past three years, but I have finally discovered the universe of Gorillaz fandom.

317
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:22,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've gone completely bonkers.

318
00:32:24,336 --> 00:32:26,458
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you talking about Gorillaz and the Mist, or what?

319
00:32:26,498 --> 00:32:28,119
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like the band.

320
00:32:32,663 --> 00:32:32,983
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

321
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:35,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything else you want to share about your week?

322
00:32:35,565 --> 00:32:36,286
[SPEAKER_08]: I had pizza.

323
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:36,866
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

324
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:38,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Eat that pizza.

325
00:32:38,443 --> 00:32:39,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, how was your week?

326
00:32:39,283 --> 00:32:39,683
[SPEAKER_08]: How was your day?

327
00:32:40,604 --> 00:32:41,345
[SPEAKER_07]: My week is okay.

328
00:32:41,365 --> 00:32:42,185
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, first, wait a minute.

329
00:32:42,205 --> 00:32:48,750
[SPEAKER_08]: First off, I hate to cut you off, but first off, tell us what the hell you're building over there with the Legos, which, by the way, you can see on camera right now, www.warnsonsradio.com.

330
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:53,474
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I haven't built anything yet because I was trying to find this goddamn piece, and I cannot find it for the life of me.

331
00:32:53,494 --> 00:32:56,856
[SPEAKER_07]: I have, like, eight of them, and I only found three, and I need four.

332
00:32:57,417 --> 00:32:59,378
[SPEAKER_07]: But because I'm smart, I'll make it work.

333
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:05,423
[SPEAKER_07]: So now what I'm building is, and you can find the link to this on our website because I posted it there.

334
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,185
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a Nintendo DS charging dock.

335
00:33:09,968 --> 00:33:11,370
[SPEAKER_07]: And it holds games and whatnot.

336
00:33:12,332 --> 00:33:15,657
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a link to the instructions on our website.

337
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:16,938
[SPEAKER_07]: Just check it out.

338
00:33:18,441 --> 00:33:19,943
[SPEAKER_07]: www.orangeloungerated.com

339
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:23,820
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was posted on a bunch of different websites they had, this guy made it, and it's pretty nifty.

340
00:33:25,341 --> 00:33:28,123
[SPEAKER_08]: So wait, is it like with the iPod, how you have those little chargers?

341
00:33:28,403 --> 00:33:30,544
[SPEAKER_08]: It's supposed to emulate that, but for a DS?

342
00:33:31,144 --> 00:33:31,465
[SPEAKER_08]: Sort of.

343
00:33:32,225 --> 00:33:40,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Basically, the charging cord or whatever, it just sits there and you set the DS right on top of it, and away you go, and it has spots for games and stuff.

344
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:46,053
[SPEAKER_07]: So I thought, because I saw the charger over there sitting there, I was like, you know, that'd be pretty cool to put one over there and just set a DS on it.

345
00:33:47,534 --> 00:33:49,075
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, that's what I'm building right now.

346
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:50,076
[SPEAKER_07]: God, this hat's hot.

347
00:33:51,098 --> 00:33:51,658
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

348
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:15,138
[SPEAKER_07]: Game Sales Position Game Sales Position

349
00:34:36,817 --> 00:34:47,024
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been playing a lot of God of War and some of this, I mentioned it last week, the Dog's Life where you can eat poop and throw it and stuff.

350
00:34:47,124 --> 00:34:47,865
[SPEAKER_07]: That's lovely.

351
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:51,407
[SPEAKER_08]: That's all dogs do.

352
00:34:51,507 --> 00:34:57,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I also got Gran Turismo 4, which I just remembered after I purchased Gran Turismo 4.

353
00:34:57,672 --> 00:34:58,072
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

354
00:34:58,132 --> 00:35:01,034
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't play much of Gran Turismo 1 when I bought it, and guess what?

355
00:35:01,074 --> 00:35:03,236
[SPEAKER_07]: I haven't played much of Gran Turismo 4 when I bought it.

356
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:04,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a remedy for you.

357
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:04,857
[SPEAKER_07]: What?

358
00:35:04,877 --> 00:35:06,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me bring over the Logitech wheel.

359
00:35:07,849 --> 00:35:08,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe.

360
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I also got TimeSplitters 3 because I have all three TimeSplitters games now.

361
00:35:14,474 --> 00:35:17,776
[SPEAKER_07]: You gotta love a game where you can actually drive a cat.

362
00:35:20,197 --> 00:35:21,658
[SPEAKER_07]: So I love TimeSplitters.

363
00:35:22,299 --> 00:35:23,319
[SPEAKER_07]: 150 unlockable characters.

364
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,901
[SPEAKER_07]: God, I love that game.

365
00:35:26,261 --> 00:35:27,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just so much fun.

366
00:35:28,963 --> 00:35:29,303
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

367
00:35:29,603 --> 00:35:31,705
[SPEAKER_07]: I think people don't really look at it as...

368
00:35:32,694 --> 00:35:34,335
[SPEAKER_07]: A very good... I mean, it's like a shooter.

369
00:35:34,375 --> 00:35:35,515
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's always looking at Halo.

370
00:35:35,535 --> 00:35:39,097
[SPEAKER_07]: But the best thing about this, it's actually an online game for the PS2.

371
00:35:39,257 --> 00:35:41,318
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've got to try the online mode with that.

372
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:42,359
[SPEAKER_07]: It'd be interesting.

373
00:35:43,300 --> 00:35:44,340
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what I've been doing.

374
00:35:45,561 --> 00:35:46,381
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty much, yeah.

375
00:35:46,581 --> 00:35:47,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, sounds good.

376
00:35:48,102 --> 00:35:49,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, and lots of Final Fantasy.

377
00:35:49,303 --> 00:35:50,483
[SPEAKER_07]: Leveled my Black Mage to 56.

378
00:35:51,264 --> 00:35:52,004
[SPEAKER_09]: Congratulations.

379
00:35:53,085 --> 00:35:53,365
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

380
00:35:55,381 --> 00:36:08,486
[SPEAKER_08]: My week and my day, let's see, not a whole lot because we're looking for the new Orange Lounge studio right now or at least the one that's going to hold us over the next phase of Orange Lounge because as you know, Loki and I live together and that's where we do this show right now is out of this house.

381
00:36:09,166 --> 00:36:10,827
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we're moving out at the end of April.

382
00:36:11,837 --> 00:36:13,198
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

383
00:36:34,088 --> 00:36:37,892
[SPEAKER_08]: because I thought, hey, it's a nerd party, so I'm going to take my DS and we'll be able to do some wireless.

384
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,854
[SPEAKER_08]: I was the only person there that brought a DS.

385
00:36:40,174 --> 00:36:45,700
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they were making fun of my carrying case, which is, yes, the same one you bought me, DDR Angel.

386
00:36:47,265 --> 00:36:50,126
[SPEAKER_08]: They were making fun of the carrying case because they said it looked like a makeup case.

387
00:36:50,547 --> 00:36:57,550
[SPEAKER_08]: So I was, you know, just messing around and I would open up the case, like pretend it was a makeup case, and I'd take out the stylus and pretend to be painting my eyelashes with it.

388
00:36:57,990 --> 00:37:01,672
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I don't know, I guess it's something you have to see, which doesn't work on radio.

389
00:37:01,692 --> 00:37:04,433
[SPEAKER_07]: But the highlight of the week was watching America's Top Model.

390
00:37:04,918 --> 00:37:14,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, the highlight of my week was for the first time, I can't believe I've been missing this gem of a show on UPN, America's Next Top Model.

391
00:37:15,583 --> 00:37:18,165
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a bunch of bitches fighting with each other.

392
00:37:18,225 --> 00:37:19,365
[SPEAKER_08]: It's so awesome.

393
00:37:19,385 --> 00:37:23,767
[SPEAKER_07]: But you've got to love a show that next week has flesh-eating viruses in it.

394
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:24,148
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, yes.

395
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:25,228
[SPEAKER_07]: You've got to love that.

396
00:37:25,248 --> 00:37:28,730
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, I know there's a lot of hatred for reality TV out there.

397
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:30,671
[SPEAKER_08]: But damn, is it entertaining.

398
00:37:30,971 --> 00:37:36,374
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's certainly more entertaining than turning on the news and hearing about that woman in Florida for the gazillionth time.

399
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:37,774
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so over her.

400
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:41,656
[SPEAKER_07]: I forgot to mention earlier, I got some new movies, and I think I mentioned it to Rob.

401
00:37:41,936 --> 00:37:45,278
[SPEAKER_07]: We watched this one called Red Silk or whatever.

402
00:37:45,958 --> 00:38:13,031
[SPEAKER_07]: and it was the weirdest movie I've ever seen where these women were naked like the entire time and they were old and nasty looking and there was just like some weird dream sequences with like a kaleidoscope and stuff and it made no sense and you couldn't understand them and in fact I actually had to read the back of the box to figure out what the plot was because I couldn't figure it out from just watching it and then it's just really strange but then I also got this movie called and this is like typical fashion for me um

403
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:27,397
[SPEAKER_07]: Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction Bloodsucking Vampire Rednecks That's nice.

404
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,419
[SPEAKER_07]: I love bad movies.

405
00:38:31,919 --> 00:38:33,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I talk about my week again now?

406
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:33,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, go ahead.

407
00:38:35,389 --> 00:38:40,390
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, let's, so I went to the party, so nobody really had, um, a DS, so we were playing Super Smash Bros.

408
00:38:40,430 --> 00:38:45,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Melee, which is always a good time, and I'm so upset that they have not made a sequel to that game.

409
00:38:45,231 --> 00:38:47,532
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, how can they have not made a sequel to Super Smash Bros.

410
00:38:47,572 --> 00:38:47,652
[SPEAKER_08]: yet?

411
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:48,672
[SPEAKER_08]: I played that just the other day.

412
00:38:48,972 --> 00:38:51,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm, I, why don't they have something yet on DS yet?

413
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:53,053
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah, I forgot, the DS doesn't have any games.

414
00:38:53,893 --> 00:38:54,833
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, oh well.

415
00:38:56,254 --> 00:39:01,155
[SPEAKER_08]: So we played that, we played a little bit of Mario Party, which also needs to come out on the DS, although I guess they have a GBA version?

416
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:01,575
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

417
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:02,215
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

418
00:39:02,925 --> 00:39:07,287
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so lost on the handheld loop right now because I'm all bitter because I can't have a PSP yet.

419
00:39:08,327 --> 00:39:08,607
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

420
00:39:09,207 --> 00:39:10,948
[SPEAKER_08]: So that was pretty much my week of my day.

421
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:12,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Nothing else that exciting going on.

422
00:39:12,969 --> 00:39:13,909
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Angel, how about you?

423
00:39:13,949 --> 00:39:14,249
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

424
00:39:15,790 --> 00:39:17,150
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Bomani this week.

425
00:39:17,990 --> 00:39:18,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh.

426
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:21,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's a DDR and in the groove.

427
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:21,912
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay.

428
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:24,633
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see.

429
00:39:25,373 --> 00:39:26,353
[SPEAKER_09]: What did you think of in the groove?

430
00:39:27,834 --> 00:39:28,674
[SPEAKER_04]: We already talked about that.

431
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:31,039
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, small arrows.

432
00:39:31,740 --> 00:39:35,143
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I noticed that, uh... How do I even say that?

433
00:39:35,223 --> 00:39:37,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it starts off small and then it pans out kind of a thing?

434
00:39:37,865 --> 00:39:38,946
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I'm talking about?

435
00:39:39,086 --> 00:39:40,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, the way the arrows scroll?

436
00:39:41,368 --> 00:39:42,629
[SPEAKER_08]: The weird scrolling thing it does?

437
00:39:42,769 --> 00:39:42,989
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.

438
00:39:43,229 --> 00:39:45,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Just call it the weird in-the-groove scrolling thing.

439
00:39:45,799 --> 00:39:47,800
[SPEAKER_04]: That makes no sense, and I'm like, damn.

440
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:52,201
[SPEAKER_04]: You only see that, though, if you're, like, really paying attention to the arrows.

441
00:39:52,261 --> 00:39:52,941
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of funky.

442
00:39:55,041 --> 00:39:57,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Also... Let's see, what else did I do this week?

443
00:39:58,002 --> 00:40:03,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I got to play a different GameCube game this week.

444
00:40:05,244 --> 00:40:05,564
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

445
00:40:06,844 --> 00:40:07,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Star Fox Assault.

446
00:40:08,425 --> 00:40:09,185
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty.

447
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:10,985
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Star Fox-y.

448
00:40:12,006 --> 00:40:12,506
[SPEAKER_04]: And, well...

449
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,551
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, not too much else.

450
00:40:18,693 --> 00:40:20,475
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to find my Chains of Promethea discs.

451
00:40:20,575 --> 00:40:20,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it.

452
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,357
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it!

453
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:25,319
[SPEAKER_04]: They've sprung legs and walked away.

454
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:27,520
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well.

455
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:30,443
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess it's telling me not to install it again.

456
00:40:31,223 --> 00:40:31,944
[SPEAKER_04]: If I can't find them.

457
00:40:32,484 --> 00:40:33,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Eh, I'll fix it.

458
00:40:34,386 --> 00:40:40,391
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll find some way to play again.

459
00:40:40,971 --> 00:40:41,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I need to.

460
00:40:42,777 --> 00:40:43,078
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

461
00:40:43,098 --> 00:40:43,358
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

462
00:40:59,215 --> 00:41:07,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget, you guys, you can join our chatroom, www.orangelinger.com, click on chat, and we're going to have the Skype line open up a little bit later so you guys can call in and interact with us.

463
00:41:07,945 --> 00:41:12,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Just head on over to www.orangelinger.com, click on interact with us for all the details.

464
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,033
[SPEAKER_08]: And as I hinted at the beginning of the program...

465
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:27,088
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually going to be doing a giveaway a little later on this evening, so you have to be either in chat or able to call us on the Skype line, because we're going to be doing a giveaway with Match Game later on tonight.

466
00:41:27,128 --> 00:41:33,215
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to have somebody on the Skype line versus somebody in the chat room, and they're going to be battling it out for a Resident Evil 4...

467
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,822
[SPEAKER_08]: CD Sampler of Music, and the ESPN NBA 2005 soundtrack.

468
00:41:39,862 --> 00:41:45,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I know we usually don't talk about sports games a whole lot on this show, but the way we see it, hey, it's free music.

469
00:41:46,143 --> 00:41:47,084
[SPEAKER_08]: So, what the heck.

470
00:41:47,544 --> 00:41:54,346
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we're going to give those away, and then we'll throw in a little something extra as well from us, the Orange Lounge Radio hosts as well.

471
00:41:54,386 --> 00:41:56,006
[SPEAKER_08]: So, get ready for that.

472
00:41:56,086 --> 00:42:00,747
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't send in anything in chat room or on Skype line just yet, because we'll be getting to that a little later in the show.

473
00:42:00,867 --> 00:42:01,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let you know when.

474
00:42:02,268 --> 00:42:02,568
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway,

475
00:42:04,072 --> 00:42:08,773
[SPEAKER_08]: Meanwhile, of course, as you know, we do this show based out of Northern California.

476
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:12,714
[SPEAKER_08]: So we try to keep tabs on what's going on in the NorCal DDR scene.

477
00:42:13,034 --> 00:42:17,315
[SPEAKER_08]: We always like hearing from you guys what's going on in your neck of the woods via the Skype line.

478
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,375
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we did have a large tournament that took place yesterday.

479
00:42:21,096 --> 00:42:22,316
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the March Madness tournament.

480
00:42:22,436 --> 00:42:27,717
[SPEAKER_08]: And I feel kind of bad because this is the very first year, I think, where I have not gone to March Madness, unfortunately.

481
00:42:28,117 --> 00:42:30,257
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had some other stuff going on that day.

482
00:42:31,538 --> 00:42:33,018
[SPEAKER_08]: But March Madness was going on

483
00:42:33,798 --> 00:42:35,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Freestyle was won by Thinner Mr. Wendell

484
00:42:53,955 --> 00:42:55,997
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

485
00:43:15,715 --> 00:43:26,038
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I haven't seen where the Perfect Attack scores are, but I'm trying to dig through the thread right here, trying to figure out what's going on, looking at the wrap-up over on DDR Freak.

486
00:43:27,659 --> 00:43:32,520
[SPEAKER_08]: The winner was Billy Jr., it looks like, for Perfect Attack, with second place, Chaos.

487
00:43:33,100 --> 00:43:35,781
[SPEAKER_08]: The last round, Max Shuffle.

488
00:43:38,143 --> 00:43:38,703
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

489
00:43:39,043 --> 00:43:40,164
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is the interesting part.

490
00:43:40,704 --> 00:43:43,205
[SPEAKER_08]: Only 24 people entered Perfect Attack this year.

491
00:43:43,726 --> 00:43:47,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is kind of... Yeah, it's kind of a little bit down from where it was previously.

492
00:43:47,687 --> 00:43:49,888
[SPEAKER_08]: So I really feel bad that I wasn't able to go.

493
00:43:50,609 --> 00:43:51,569
[SPEAKER_08]: I just had other stuff going on.

494
00:43:51,609 --> 00:43:55,751
[SPEAKER_08]: But is this a sign that the DDR tournaments are running out of steam?

495
00:43:55,991 --> 00:43:56,511
[SPEAKER_08]: What do you think?

496
00:43:56,752 --> 00:43:58,472
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, Jamie, you've won a lot of DDR tournaments.

497
00:43:58,492 --> 00:44:00,093
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's starting to run out of steam or what's up?

498
00:44:00,193 --> 00:44:00,793
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, yeah.

499
00:44:01,694 --> 00:44:06,336
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... I mean, I'm kind of sad that I missed out on going to this one, but...

500
00:44:08,228 --> 00:44:09,009
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching!

501
00:44:27,708 --> 00:44:28,108
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

502
00:44:51,804 --> 00:44:57,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Dance Gaming Community as it is, so I think a lot of folks, you know, if they're not in the groove, they're not going to check out one of these tournaments.

503
00:44:58,048 --> 00:45:00,330
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I don't know, it's just kind of too bad.

504
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:08,135
[SPEAKER_08]: I hope it's not a sign that DDR is dying in the arcades, but at the same time, without new DDR, the heck are we supposed to do?

505
00:45:09,156 --> 00:45:09,456
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

506
00:45:10,316 --> 00:45:13,639
[SPEAKER_08]: People are coming up with clever ideas, though, to keep it fresh, so, you know, hats off to them.

507
00:45:14,779 --> 00:45:16,300
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any thoughts on the tournament?

508
00:45:19,624 --> 00:45:41,803
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, I haven't been in a tournament in a long time, it's just not my thing, I don't know I think a lot of people are just, I don't know, just tournaments Maybe because the crowd that's getting into it now is more new at it or something And that's why they feel maybe a little intimidated to go up against these people

509
00:45:43,732 --> 00:45:44,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's my guess.

510
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:49,896
[SPEAKER_07]: Or the fact that these people that are coming in are getting introduced to it on the home console.

511
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:57,922
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe they're just not really getting into it with the environment, like the crowd and stuff, as they would if they started off in the arcade.

512
00:45:57,942 --> 00:45:59,704
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

513
00:45:59,764 --> 00:46:00,304
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my guess.

514
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:03,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I think it's just kind of too bad.

515
00:46:03,452 --> 00:46:06,993
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that it's just not the huge thing it was.

516
00:46:07,373 --> 00:46:12,914
[SPEAKER_08]: And you're right, maybe a lot of that is because people are starting on the home mixes now.

517
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:19,736
[SPEAKER_08]: But I'm surprised that I don't see more, if that's the case, more of these tournaments that are conducted on home mixes.

518
00:46:21,016 --> 00:46:23,777
[SPEAKER_08]: But maybe that's because of the fact that...

519
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:31,412
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe that's because of the fact that it's kind of harder to run a fair tournament on home mixes.

520
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:32,613
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, what do you guys think?

521
00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:36,034
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you think it's possible to run a fair tournament on home mixes with home pads and stuff?

522
00:46:36,074 --> 00:46:38,014
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, we did it at Shaft.

523
00:46:39,074 --> 00:46:43,595
[SPEAKER_02]: When we had to do a quick fix, we pulled out modded pads and he won second place.

524
00:46:43,936 --> 00:46:44,656
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's true.

525
00:46:47,825 --> 00:46:51,567
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, the fiancÃ© of DarkSakura has just joined us.

526
00:46:51,747 --> 00:46:52,947
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan the Man is back.

527
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,848
[SPEAKER_08]: You may remember him from a couple weeks ago.

528
00:46:54,908 --> 00:46:59,630
[SPEAKER_08]: He was here telling you guys to go buy ignition pads at his local GameStop.

529
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:01,791
[SPEAKER_08]: My second legendary appearance.

530
00:47:01,911 --> 00:47:02,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

531
00:47:02,311 --> 00:47:03,412
[SPEAKER_08]: So did it work?

532
00:47:03,452 --> 00:47:04,292
[SPEAKER_00]: Did anybody buy any?

533
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:05,193
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell no.

534
00:47:05,413 --> 00:47:05,813
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn.

535
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,514
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody buys the ignition pads.

536
00:47:07,814 --> 00:47:08,374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's too bad to hear.

537
00:47:08,394 --> 00:47:09,455
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we sold one.

538
00:47:09,475 --> 00:47:10,895
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that was from us.

539
00:47:10,915 --> 00:47:15,937
[SPEAKER_00]: So to replace it, they sent me two cheap GameStop brand knockoff ignition pads.

540
00:47:16,057 --> 00:47:16,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hooray.

541
00:47:16,538 --> 00:47:17,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck y'all.

542
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:22,044
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now you brought a treat to show us here in studio tonight, correct?

543
00:47:23,506 --> 00:47:24,047
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.

544
00:47:24,507 --> 00:47:24,968
[SPEAKER_08]: What's that?

545
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:26,590
[SPEAKER_00]: My pants.

546
00:47:28,192 --> 00:47:28,673
[SPEAKER_08]: Hooray!

547
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:32,890
[SPEAKER_08]: No, really, what did you bring?

548
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that a PSP?

549
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:36,532
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to put that on cam.

550
00:47:36,612 --> 00:47:40,314
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be showing that on cam during the break so you guys can see how pretty it is.

551
00:47:40,334 --> 00:47:44,937
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to get some of the music on it if we can get the speakers to pick it up.

552
00:47:45,237 --> 00:47:47,798
[SPEAKER_08]: We might be able to do something where we can hook it into the mixing board.

553
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:49,079
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see what we can do.

554
00:47:49,379 --> 00:47:50,840
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got USB connection on it.

555
00:47:51,441 --> 00:47:51,841
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right on.

556
00:47:52,641 --> 00:47:52,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

557
00:47:53,542 --> 00:47:53,802
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

558
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,315
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

559
00:48:09,273 --> 00:48:11,275
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll be back after this next break.

560
00:48:11,435 --> 00:48:15,759
[SPEAKER_08]: In this next break, we're actually going to play some music from 2DX Night Style.

561
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:18,841
[SPEAKER_08]: But this is brand new music from the home version.

562
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:20,403
[SPEAKER_08]: We call these consumer tracks.

563
00:48:20,843 --> 00:48:24,446
[SPEAKER_08]: So when they are songs specifically made for the home release of the game.

564
00:48:24,786 --> 00:48:27,088
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to hear some brand new 2DX Night Style songs.

565
00:48:27,108 --> 00:48:29,611
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start it off with a brand new LED song.

566
00:48:29,991 --> 00:48:31,292
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called Photogenic.

567
00:48:31,752 --> 00:48:33,694
[SPEAKER_08]: So enjoy this and three other songs.

568
00:48:34,255 --> 00:48:35,596
[SPEAKER_08]: And we'll be back after this.

569
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:39,503
DarkSakura.com

570
00:49:07,985 --> 00:49:12,213
[SPEAKER_19]: So I come into the world to be someone Taking you to the place with you

571
00:49:40,393 --> 00:49:40,914
and many more.

572
00:50:08,687 --> 00:50:09,348
Thanks for watching!

573
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,125
Thank you for watching!

574
00:51:43,234 --> 00:51:44,539
Thanks for watching!

575
00:52:34,558 --> 00:52:39,841
[SPEAKER_19]: Come join our party, see how we play

576
00:53:16,878 --> 00:53:19,760
[SPEAKER_19]: Hatsune Miku Hatsune Miku Hatsune Miku

577
00:54:00,075 --> 00:54:01,458
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

578
00:54:25,925 --> 00:54:26,806
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

579
00:56:29,193 --> 00:56:38,553
[SPEAKER_16]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

580
00:56:39,302 --> 00:56:43,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

581
00:56:43,426 --> 00:56:44,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we talk about that?

582
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:47,029
[SPEAKER_19]: No subject will ever be taboo.

583
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:50,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

584
00:56:51,453 --> 00:56:53,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

585
00:56:54,516 --> 00:56:59,881
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

586
00:57:00,442 --> 00:57:01,723
[SPEAKER_19]: I collect your fucking head.

587
00:57:03,678 --> 00:57:05,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like this fucker here.

588
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:09,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

589
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,601
[SPEAKER_05]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

590
00:57:14,541 --> 00:57:20,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

591
00:57:22,223 --> 00:57:25,924
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

592
00:57:29,787 --> 00:57:32,169
[SPEAKER_08]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

593
00:57:32,209 --> 00:57:33,411
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you enjoyed that break.

594
00:57:33,451 --> 00:57:36,774
[SPEAKER_08]: Some brand new music we're playing on Orange Lounge Radio for the first time.

595
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:40,417
[SPEAKER_08]: Some tracks from 2DX Night Style, the consumer version.

596
00:57:40,918 --> 00:57:41,799
[SPEAKER_08]: We had a night break.

597
00:57:41,839 --> 00:57:43,901
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some LED with Photogenic.

598
00:57:45,162 --> 00:57:48,005
[SPEAKER_08]: Ota 2 with Usual Days, a remix there.

599
00:57:48,675 --> 00:58:16,177
[SPEAKER_08]: Gupperslope with 80's Capsule and the brand new Jaeger remix which I guess is to complete some type of trilogy or something going on there so I don't know how I feel about that new Jaeger remix though because it sounds to me like it's the hamster dance they need the Jaeger Meister mix now now that would be awesome but the video is kind of cool so what can you do about that all the strong Jaeger ones are pretty cool alright alright

600
00:58:16,866 --> 00:58:19,354
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do now is we actually are going to take...

601
00:58:20,032 --> 00:58:20,632
[SPEAKER_08]: I call that my influence.

602
00:58:50,692 --> 00:58:51,855
[SPEAKER_02]: As the resident female.

603
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:52,617
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I know, that's fine.

604
00:58:52,637 --> 00:58:53,640
[SPEAKER_02]: I can change anything I want.

605
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,144
[SPEAKER_08]: As the resident moody female, yes.

606
00:58:55,706 --> 00:58:56,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Moody?

607
00:58:56,829 --> 00:58:57,651
[SPEAKER_08]: Just, love ya.

608
00:58:58,072 --> 00:58:58,333
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

609
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:06,380
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do, actually, is we also had, just recently come out within this past week, we had Service Pack... I'm sorry, I keep calling these things Service Pack.

610
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:10,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Song Pack 9 just came out for DDR Ultramix 2.

611
00:59:11,043 --> 00:59:20,788
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do is we're actually going to have Loki play some of these songs on air, and he's going to give us his feedback to the steps to these songs live as he dances to them.

612
00:59:20,968 --> 00:59:25,170
[SPEAKER_08]: This is our excuse because they think I'm too fat, and so they said, you've got to work, you've got to exercise.

613
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki has to dance because he is the pudgiest.

614
00:59:28,252 --> 00:59:28,432
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey!

615
00:59:29,192 --> 00:59:31,775
[SPEAKER_08]: That's not fair.

616
00:59:31,895 --> 00:59:32,615
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the bacon.

617
00:59:32,956 --> 00:59:33,876
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically what it is.

618
00:59:33,956 --> 00:59:34,137
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

619
00:59:34,477 --> 00:59:34,777
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

620
00:59:35,758 --> 00:59:40,262
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we're going to do... We weren't able to set this up to do on Xbox Live, huh?

621
00:59:40,282 --> 00:59:44,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Because we have our... Well... You want to set it up on Xbox?

622
00:59:44,805 --> 00:59:45,086
[SPEAKER_08]: Nah.

623
00:59:45,286 --> 00:59:46,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't take too long to get an opponent.

624
00:59:46,687 --> 00:59:47,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

625
00:59:47,428 --> 00:59:47,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Forget it.

626
00:59:47,728 --> 00:59:47,968
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

627
00:59:48,228 --> 00:59:49,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's bring in the ultimate two sounds.

628
00:59:51,411 --> 00:59:51,771
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

629
00:59:54,542 --> 01:00:23,224
[SPEAKER_08]: you gotta find a song from Song Pack 9 alright alright but don't you dare play Forever Sunshine cause I hate that crap gotcha pick a skill level now you can see I don't want any ass shots here and the background live on cam www.orangeloungeradio.com alright ok that's fine go to the left it'll be faster you know alright let's see here

[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Regret, Ogia, there's Jelly Kiss.

631
01:00:31,439 --> 01:00:33,580
[SPEAKER_08]: No, you're going back into Song Pack 7 and stuff.

632
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:34,881
[SPEAKER_08]: Go over to... Alright.

633
01:00:35,902 --> 01:00:36,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

634
01:00:39,790 --> 01:00:44,551
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

635
01:01:12,253 --> 01:01:14,894
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, for a five-footer, I mean, there's not much to expect of this one.

636
01:01:16,154 --> 01:01:17,815
[SPEAKER_07]: That's five on heavy.

637
01:01:17,855 --> 01:01:18,415
[SPEAKER_07]: It's pretty bad.

638
01:01:28,759 --> 01:01:30,140
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of hard for a five-footer.

639
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:31,880
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got, like, offbeat notes and everything.

640
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:41,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at us.

641
01:01:41,167 --> 01:01:42,707
[SPEAKER_08]: It's kind of like fast stuff.

642
01:01:43,607 --> 01:01:45,568
[SPEAKER_08]: This seems kind of hard for a five to me.

643
01:01:45,628 --> 01:01:47,388
[SPEAKER_08]: It would be different like a six.

644
01:01:47,728 --> 01:01:52,730
[SPEAKER_02]: If our listeners are watching the webcam on OrangeRomeRadio.com, they can get a pretty good view of us.

645
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:53,990
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.

646
01:01:54,570 --> 01:01:57,711
[SPEAKER_08]: And just so you know, yes, my colors are all screwed up on the notes.

647
01:01:58,251 --> 01:02:00,152
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll tell you why I do that after Loki finishes.

648
01:02:02,533 --> 01:02:06,214
[SPEAKER_08]: It's my way of kind of like getting an edge up on Xbox Live when I play.

649
01:02:06,914 --> 01:02:07,214
[SPEAKER_13]: Cheater.

650
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:11,295
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not a cheater, I'm just exploiting something in the game.

651
01:02:11,315 --> 01:02:12,875
This is not a five, I'm sorry.

652
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,256
That is not a five.

653
01:02:38,450 --> 01:02:39,130
[SPEAKER_07]: Seven, maybe?

654
01:02:45,112 --> 01:02:50,254
[SPEAKER_07]: But then again, I can't really judge song difficulty anymore, because, like, I'm out of shape.

655
01:02:52,174 --> 01:02:53,675
[SPEAKER_02]: This plays about like a seven.

656
01:02:53,755 --> 01:02:55,875
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, how many calories would you say you burned on that one?

657
01:02:56,216 --> 01:02:56,716
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

658
01:02:57,136 --> 01:02:57,776
[SPEAKER_02]: I could tell you.

659
01:02:58,476 --> 01:02:58,676
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

660
01:02:58,696 --> 01:02:59,036
[SPEAKER_02]: About 40.

661
01:03:00,617 --> 01:03:01,317
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, let's see.

662
01:03:01,957 --> 01:03:04,118
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what kind of grade Loki got on that one.

663
01:03:04,724 --> 01:03:08,707
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, 37 greats, I'd say that's about a C. Oh, he got an A!

664
01:03:08,788 --> 01:03:09,648
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I rock.

665
01:03:09,868 --> 01:03:10,369
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

666
01:03:10,389 --> 01:03:12,150
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so what did you think of those steps?

667
01:03:13,071 --> 01:03:14,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Eh, they were okay.

668
01:03:14,292 --> 01:03:16,554
[SPEAKER_02]: They were kind of fun, except that, you know, I hate free stuff.

669
01:03:18,236 --> 01:03:20,718
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, now you've got to do the kata, do Disable the Flaw.

670
01:03:20,738 --> 01:03:21,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, God.

671
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:22,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, I'll hold the mic for you.

672
01:03:22,719 --> 01:03:22,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

673
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:24,881
[SPEAKER_08]: No, make him hold the mic while he does it.

674
01:03:24,981 --> 01:03:26,262
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

675
01:03:26,623 --> 01:03:27,503
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want him to trip.

676
01:03:27,704 --> 01:03:28,544
[SPEAKER_08]: I want feedback.

677
01:03:28,564 --> 01:03:30,906
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want him to trip up the cord and die.

678
01:03:30,946 --> 01:03:31,487
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll live.

679
01:03:33,717 --> 01:03:35,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, I'll hold the cord up so you don't trip.

680
01:03:35,718 --> 01:03:37,918
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise to set you on fire at your funeral.

681
01:03:38,098 --> 01:03:39,379
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm gonna hate you, man.

682
01:03:40,019 --> 01:03:41,459
[SPEAKER_08]: We will launch you out to sea when you die.

683
01:03:42,399 --> 01:03:43,020
[SPEAKER_02]: In a catapult.

684
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:47,241
[SPEAKER_08]: What, this song's only like a minute ten.

685
01:03:58,544 --> 01:03:59,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't fail.

686
01:03:59,304 --> 01:04:00,505
[SPEAKER_08]: You're on the internet right now.

687
01:04:00,545 --> 01:04:01,885
[SPEAKER_08]: They'll all know if you fail this crap.

688
01:04:02,446 --> 01:04:02,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

689
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:12,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Cool down break.

690
01:04:14,557 --> 01:04:16,258
[SPEAKER_08]: I gotta cut up some slack on this mic cord.

691
01:04:20,642 --> 01:04:21,463
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

692
01:04:23,585 --> 01:04:24,045
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh man.

693
01:04:25,667 --> 01:04:28,109
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like classic Kata stuff.

694
01:04:32,253 --> 01:04:33,133
[SPEAKER_08]: I love this song, though.

695
01:04:33,153 --> 01:04:34,613
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like a real gem in this song.

696
01:04:34,774 --> 01:04:37,454
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say this is my favorite song in this song pack.

697
01:04:37,494 --> 01:04:41,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, miss, boo, boo, boo, boo, boo.

698
01:04:42,575 --> 01:04:47,096
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, he's got, he's got a... Huh.

699
01:04:47,296 --> 01:04:47,576
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank God.

700
01:04:48,116 --> 01:04:49,016
[SPEAKER_07]: Good job.

701
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:49,977
[SPEAKER_07]: I am so out of shape.

702
01:04:50,037 --> 01:04:51,257
[SPEAKER_07]: I really need to go back and play.

703
01:04:51,537 --> 01:04:52,457
[SPEAKER_08]: What'd you think of those steps?

704
01:04:55,118 --> 01:04:56,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, is it a worthy download?

705
01:04:56,598 --> 01:04:56,978
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you pay?

706
01:04:57,118 --> 01:04:59,478
[SPEAKER_08]: You got a D. Shut up.

707
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:01,599
[SPEAKER_02]: D for, uh, the bum ass.

708
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:09,186
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I would say, if you're out of shape like me, don't play the Cat is on Pat.

709
01:05:09,206 --> 01:05:11,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you spend $5 for that?

710
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:13,048
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to turn down the Ultramix music there.

711
01:05:14,088 --> 01:05:14,689
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I would.

712
01:05:16,149 --> 01:05:17,830
[SPEAKER_07]: Really, they're kind of stretching for songs now.

713
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:19,491
[SPEAKER_02]: Ooh, your D is on the webcam, too.

714
01:05:22,772 --> 01:05:23,092
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

715
01:05:24,433 --> 01:05:25,113
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done, man.

716
01:05:25,413 --> 01:05:26,213
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, you're done?

717
01:05:26,894 --> 01:05:29,134
[SPEAKER_08]: You sure you don't want to do one Forever Sunshine, Jamie, for us?

718
01:05:29,895 --> 01:05:30,175
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll do it.

719
01:05:31,997 --> 01:05:33,217
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm trying to get Jamie to get up there.

720
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:37,519
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, I'm serious.

721
01:05:37,559 --> 01:05:38,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't play Forever Sunshine.

722
01:05:38,399 --> 01:05:38,980
[SPEAKER_08]: I was totally kidding.

723
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:39,480
[SPEAKER_08]: I hate that song.

724
01:05:39,500 --> 01:05:43,741
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play Forever Sunshine, I will cut off your ankles.

725
01:05:43,801 --> 01:05:44,622
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Ogia.

726
01:05:47,683 --> 01:05:50,544
[SPEAKER_07]: I would have to say, yeah, it's worth a download.

727
01:05:50,564 --> 01:05:51,824
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the steps are pretty good.

728
01:05:52,224 --> 01:05:56,406
[SPEAKER_07]: They weren't retarded like, say, you know, was it...

729
01:05:57,748 --> 01:06:00,933
[SPEAKER_07]: Outer Limits or anything like that, where it's just ridiculous fast and stuff.

730
01:06:01,254 --> 01:06:06,802
[SPEAKER_07]: The Table of Flaw, they had stuff sort of like your old school Katas, where it's a long run of eighth notes and stuff like that.

731
01:06:07,824 --> 01:06:08,165
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty good.

732
01:06:08,986 --> 01:06:09,627
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, sounds good.

733
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:15,022
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, for those of you guys that are wondering, why the hell does it show the red notes and blue notes and yellow notes?

734
01:06:15,063 --> 01:06:15,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Why doesn't it look right?

735
01:06:16,303 --> 01:06:23,167
[SPEAKER_08]: It's because, actually, the way my system is set up on the Xbox, I actually have it set to show the notes, the different colors on purpose.

736
01:06:23,587 --> 01:06:29,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the reason why I do that is so that when I go on Xbox Live, it shows up that way, and it makes it so much easier to read the notes.

737
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:32,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you really can't change things when you play on Xbox Live.

738
01:06:33,672 --> 01:06:35,333
[SPEAKER_02]: What other songs came out in that song pack?

739
01:06:36,033 --> 01:06:36,513
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Gia.

740
01:06:36,553 --> 01:06:37,154
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that one.

741
01:06:39,475 --> 01:06:39,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that

742
01:06:40,984 --> 01:06:42,884
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Guitar Freaks, I think?

743
01:06:44,025 --> 01:06:45,245
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this is originally from Guitar Freaks.

744
01:06:46,225 --> 01:06:51,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, and then we've got Regret, which is, what was that?

745
01:06:54,967 --> 01:06:57,928
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, okay, well, Regret I think was Beatmania, wasn't it?

746
01:06:57,948 --> 01:06:58,188
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

747
01:06:58,448 --> 01:07:00,789
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we have Jelly Kiss from 2DX7, I believe.

748
01:07:02,259 --> 01:07:05,382
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we've got Disabled, The Flaw, which is Beatmania.

749
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:08,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Beatmania and I think Poppin' Music.

750
01:07:08,485 --> 01:07:11,747
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Forever Sunshine, which is Max, too.

751
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:14,410
[SPEAKER_07]: And everyone remembers that song for being so awful.

752
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:19,294
[SPEAKER_07]: I think pretty good.

753
01:07:19,774 --> 01:07:20,996
[SPEAKER_07]: For five bucks, I mean, you can't beat it.

754
01:07:21,116 --> 01:07:21,796
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

755
01:07:22,397 --> 01:07:23,037
[SPEAKER_07]: Just download it.

756
01:07:23,658 --> 01:07:24,419
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait for the next pack.

757
01:07:24,439 --> 01:07:26,901
[SPEAKER_09]: It's better than some of the other song packs they put out not that long ago.

758
01:07:26,941 --> 01:07:27,401
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.

759
01:07:27,922 --> 01:07:28,162
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

760
01:07:29,072 --> 01:07:34,376
[SPEAKER_02]: Just as long as we don't get a whole song pack of mixes of Let Them Move, then it's not too bad.

761
01:07:35,817 --> 01:07:36,098
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

762
01:07:36,538 --> 01:07:37,519
[SPEAKER_09]: So, I don't know.

763
01:07:37,539 --> 01:07:38,599
[SPEAKER_09]: Are we going to do one more?

764
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:39,860
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, why not?

765
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:40,461
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, one more.

766
01:07:40,501 --> 01:07:41,141
[SPEAKER_07]: Do Oh Yeah!

767
01:07:41,181 --> 01:07:41,702
[SPEAKER_07]: I like that one.

768
01:07:41,722 --> 01:07:42,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh Yeah?

769
01:07:42,202 --> 01:07:42,442
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

770
01:07:44,664 --> 01:07:44,924
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

771
01:07:46,185 --> 01:07:47,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's bring up the Ultramix 2 music again.

772
01:07:49,988 --> 01:07:50,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I like this song.

773
01:07:50,788 --> 01:07:51,209
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry.

774
01:07:51,549 --> 01:07:52,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Done by Asmat Nemi.

775
01:07:52,730 --> 01:07:52,870
[SPEAKER_19]: Ready?

776
01:07:52,910 --> 01:07:53,710
[SPEAKER_19]: Here we go!

777
01:07:53,770 --> 01:07:54,371
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh Yeah!

778
01:07:57,864 --> 01:08:01,927
[SPEAKER_08]: From what I remember about this song, it's just one constant stream of notes, really.

779
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:10,234
[SPEAKER_19]: It's a very poppin' music.

780
01:08:10,935 --> 01:08:11,275
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.

781
01:08:11,815 --> 01:08:13,217
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what it looks like?

782
01:08:13,377 --> 01:08:19,802
[SPEAKER_08]: It looks like that they actually put in, like, new background videos, though, in some of this, which I think is kind of cool.

783
01:08:21,623 --> 01:08:24,446
[SPEAKER_08]: Or at least, like, background videos we haven't really seen before, so...

784
01:08:26,634 --> 01:08:27,595
[SPEAKER_19]: That was very wormy.

785
01:08:28,815 --> 01:08:32,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I like this song because it's different for DDR.

786
01:08:32,377 --> 01:08:35,278
[SPEAKER_19]: Like, you're like, what the heck is this?

787
01:08:35,358 --> 01:08:38,080
[SPEAKER_19]: It's like Bollywood or something.

788
01:08:49,873 --> 01:08:50,414
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those runs.

789
01:08:50,434 --> 01:08:51,054
[SPEAKER_02]: I love those cheap runs.

790
01:08:51,174 --> 01:08:53,357
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, dude, Loki's like hecka sweating.

791
01:08:53,397 --> 01:08:54,157
Look at that.

792
01:08:54,177 --> 01:08:55,919
[SPEAKER_19]: This is called out of the game.

793
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:56,540
[SPEAKER_19]: Dance, monkey, dance.

794
01:09:15,197 --> 01:09:19,980
[SPEAKER_08]: When we bring the webcam back up, I want to zoom in on Loki's sweat to show what a workout he's getting there.

795
01:09:21,261 --> 01:09:23,222
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh man, my legs feel like weights.

796
01:09:23,242 --> 01:09:26,464
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm surprised I could play something, but I don't want to play any of those songs.

797
01:09:26,504 --> 01:09:26,924
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.

798
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:29,065
[SPEAKER_02]: Those songs still seem very fun to me.

799
01:09:30,166 --> 01:09:31,387
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to do something from Song Pack 8?

800
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:31,867
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

801
01:09:35,029 --> 01:09:36,750
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright Jamie, come on, show us how to do it.

802
01:09:38,351 --> 01:09:39,071
[SPEAKER_19]: Alrighty.

803
01:09:42,173 --> 01:09:42,634
[SPEAKER_08]: Alrighty.

804
01:09:45,037 --> 01:09:48,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually, the chatroom is suggesting you do a freestyle to this one.

805
01:09:50,258 --> 01:09:52,419
[SPEAKER_08]: Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle.

806
01:09:52,999 --> 01:09:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom, love y'all, but y'all suck.

807
01:09:55,039 --> 01:10:04,941
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, she got a D. Or, I'm sorry, he got a D. Another D. Jamie's here to pretty up the photo op.

808
01:10:11,152 --> 01:10:13,373
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really much, though, because Loki's a damn sexy man.

809
01:10:14,114 --> 01:10:14,454
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.

810
01:10:17,455 --> 01:10:18,376
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to play some more.

811
01:10:18,536 --> 01:10:19,977
[SPEAKER_00]: Do another regular Ultimax 2 songs.

812
01:10:21,077 --> 01:10:22,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see a dance in your dance.

813
01:10:28,739 --> 01:10:29,300
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm fine.

814
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,903
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that's... That's the picture to get.

815
01:10:33,943 --> 01:10:34,924
[SPEAKER_00]: The agony of defeat.

816
01:10:36,565 --> 01:10:39,207
[SPEAKER_19]: Play Max 300.

817
01:10:41,968 --> 01:10:42,429
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

818
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:44,410
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't remember that.

819
01:10:45,811 --> 01:10:49,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Japanese tourists taking pictures, man.

820
01:10:51,935 --> 01:10:53,577
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because you're an American tourist attraction.

821
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:56,359
[SPEAKER_08]: She's like, I'm in heaven or close your eyes or skulk or something.

822
01:10:59,042 --> 01:11:00,422
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, there's a song called Gyrus.

823
01:11:00,642 --> 01:11:01,843
[SPEAKER_00]: That's totally sweet.

824
01:11:01,903 --> 01:11:04,303
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a remix of the Gyrus theme from... Dude!

825
01:11:04,423 --> 01:11:12,325
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.

826
01:11:12,345 --> 01:11:13,265
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie's apologizing.

827
01:11:13,305 --> 01:11:15,386
[SPEAKER_08]: It's taking her so long to pick a song, but she's just kind of picky.

828
01:11:16,426 --> 01:11:17,286
[SPEAKER_08]: Four weeks later.

829
01:11:18,406 --> 01:11:24,367
[SPEAKER_08]: By the way, we hardly ever actually play DDR on the show, so this is a rare opportunity for you guys.

830
01:11:24,507 --> 01:11:25,108
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

831
01:11:25,348 --> 01:11:26,828
[SPEAKER_07]: As if you can't tell by the wheezing.

832
01:11:27,785 --> 01:11:28,946
[SPEAKER_07]: I play a lot of DDR.

833
01:11:31,087 --> 01:11:31,447
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

834
01:11:31,827 --> 01:11:32,147
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah.

835
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:32,688
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

836
01:11:32,708 --> 01:11:33,828
[SPEAKER_09]: Come on.

837
01:11:35,069 --> 01:11:43,353
[SPEAKER_09]: Boo.

838
01:11:43,433 --> 01:11:49,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Hold down B. No, I lied.

839
01:11:49,597 --> 01:11:53,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Hit A. And this time hold down A. Hold down.

840
01:11:53,679 --> 01:11:54,059
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.

841
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:56,601
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can go down to...

842
01:11:58,214 --> 01:11:58,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Other.

843
01:12:00,975 --> 01:12:02,775
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's where you can turn off the freeze arrows.

844
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:04,375
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh no, there it is, right there, freeze.

845
01:12:05,896 --> 01:12:06,196
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

846
01:12:06,916 --> 01:12:10,977
[SPEAKER_08]: This is going to be the last one, and Jamie's going to give you her thoughts on Chasmic Cowgirl.

847
01:12:12,637 --> 01:12:14,097
[SPEAKER_07]: She says she hasn't played DDR in a month.

848
01:12:24,499 --> 01:12:27,320
[SPEAKER_00]: She's making it look good with so many crepes on Perfects.

849
01:12:30,748 --> 01:12:31,589
[SPEAKER_00]: Go, Jamie!

850
01:12:37,592 --> 01:12:39,614
[SPEAKER_08]: I used to love this song when I was in Guitar Freaks.

851
01:12:40,154 --> 01:12:42,836
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just thinking, man, this makes me want to play Guitar Freaks.

852
01:12:44,917 --> 01:12:46,098
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys have Guitar Freaks?

853
01:12:46,558 --> 01:12:48,099
[SPEAKER_00]: No, sadly not here.

854
01:12:48,299 --> 01:12:49,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Damn, I should have brought mine.

855
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:54,623
[SPEAKER_19]: You got us shaking our butts now, Mr. DJ.

856
01:12:54,983 --> 01:12:57,285
[SPEAKER_00]: You do got us shaking our butts now, Mr. DJ.

857
01:13:04,625 --> 01:13:06,685
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, well, she just has to go and show me up now.

858
01:13:07,746 --> 01:13:08,486
[SPEAKER_07]: That's no fair.

859
01:13:12,567 --> 01:13:14,267
[SPEAKER_07]: That's because she's more in shape than I am.

860
01:13:14,827 --> 01:13:18,328
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, she's been preparing for that mud run, so you know she's got the stamina for this.

861
01:13:18,388 --> 01:13:19,728
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been preparing for a Big Mac.

862
01:13:24,629 --> 01:13:30,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, and get this, sesame seed bun, baby.

863
01:13:32,051 --> 01:13:33,631
[SPEAKER_00]: Too much burger for one man to handle.

864
01:13:47,219 --> 01:13:48,199
[SPEAKER_09]: Yay!

865
01:13:48,279 --> 01:13:48,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, what'd you think?

866
01:13:49,260 --> 01:14:14,860
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so freaking easy, that wasn't an 8 Okay, so that, you know, they have an 8 Kill us, your moves And a 5 for New high score The verdict is a B She got a slightly better score than Loki, thank you That's cause he said something that made me laugh It was a new high score I broke someone's goal, whore Alright, so what'd you think of that?

867
01:14:15,509 --> 01:14:16,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Here's your chair, Beck.

868
01:14:16,770 --> 01:14:17,050
[SPEAKER_09]: Fun?

869
01:14:19,371 --> 01:14:19,991
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, pretty fun.

870
01:14:20,351 --> 01:14:20,651
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

871
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:22,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I need to start doing DDR again.

872
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:25,253
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

873
01:14:25,393 --> 01:14:31,176
[SPEAKER_08]: Because the ironic thing is, even though we talk about these music games a whole lot here on the station, we haven't played them in quite a while.

874
01:14:31,236 --> 01:14:33,657
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

875
01:14:33,817 --> 01:14:35,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, I played Step Mania, but that's with my hand.

876
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:39,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I played the Button Button Revolution, and that's still kind of fun.

877
01:14:39,160 --> 01:14:41,321
[SPEAKER_02]: I now know why people don't exercise in jeans.

878
01:14:41,621 --> 01:14:41,941
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

879
01:14:42,361 --> 01:14:43,902
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, can we go back to regular?

880
01:14:43,942 --> 01:14:44,042
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

881
01:14:44,102 --> 01:14:44,362
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

882
01:14:45,307 --> 01:14:48,402
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're going to do now is we're going to go ahead and open up the Skype line.

883
01:14:49,255 --> 01:15:05,679
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you guys that have any feedback, you want to talk about 2DX Night Style, or you want to talk about what else is going on in the scene, we were talking a little bit about Bawani tournaments going on earlier, and if you have any feedback on Ultramix 2 and the performance of DarkSakura and Loki, we certainly would love to hear that as well.

884
01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:09,780
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call.

885
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:16,261
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, to do that, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

886
01:15:18,208 --> 01:15:20,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go ahead, we got one coming in.

887
01:15:21,470 --> 01:15:22,991
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

888
01:15:25,453 --> 01:15:26,393
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku here.

889
01:15:26,533 --> 01:15:27,754
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Zaku, how you doing?

890
01:15:28,154 --> 01:15:32,337
[SPEAKER_12]: As always, I'm... Yes, I'm... Hi, Zaku.

891
01:15:33,638 --> 01:15:38,001
[SPEAKER_12]: Just coming back from Spring Break and all, and managing to play 2DX10 style, unfortunately.

892
01:15:39,302 --> 01:15:41,443
[SPEAKER_12]: Wait, you did get to play 2DX10 style?

893
01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:42,564
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of like, yeah...

894
01:15:44,651 --> 01:15:50,318
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, because, you know, Long Island, not far from the city, has a place that has 2DX10.

895
01:15:50,738 --> 01:15:56,705
[SPEAKER_12]: And I managed to travel out there by bus, like a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday.

896
01:15:56,845 --> 01:15:58,307
[SPEAKER_08]: Getting on the bus to go nerd it up, huh?

897
01:15:59,733 --> 01:16:14,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but it was worth the trip, you know, because, you know, not only did they have that, they also had in the groove poppin' music, they had Flash Bees, which is basically Step Mania in a solo cabinet with poppin' music buttons.

898
01:16:15,579 --> 01:16:18,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I've heard of that game, it was, god, I can't remember.

899
01:16:19,278 --> 01:16:19,898
[SPEAKER_07]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

900
01:16:46,576 --> 01:16:51,509
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean I saw other folks breaking out the towel and putting it on there, but... I can't play without a towel.

901
01:16:53,806 --> 01:16:59,450
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, you know, I'm hearing word that 2DX12 Happy Sky is going up for location testing.

902
01:16:59,690 --> 01:17:00,331
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yes.

903
01:17:00,631 --> 01:17:02,813
[SPEAKER_02]: That name is so... You repeat us to it.

904
01:17:02,853 --> 01:17:04,634
[SPEAKER_08]: We were going to talk about that a little bit later.

905
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:10,178
[SPEAKER_08]: But yes, they've announced 2DX12 style, also known as Happy Sky.

906
01:17:10,298 --> 01:17:13,020
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is ironic when you consider what my online name is, Sky.

907
01:17:13,420 --> 01:17:14,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Happy Sky!

908
01:17:14,201 --> 01:17:15,302
[SPEAKER_08]: That made you Happy Sky.

909
01:17:15,322 --> 01:17:16,162
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm so happy!

910
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:17,323
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm happy that this game's coming.

911
01:17:17,343 --> 01:17:18,104
[SPEAKER_12]: At this point, I mean...

912
01:17:18,897 --> 01:17:22,640
[SPEAKER_12]: We managed to get the upgrade in that place that managed to get 10th style.

913
01:17:23,281 --> 01:17:32,208
[SPEAKER_12]: See, it was originally 9th, but late last year they managed to go up to 10th, seeing that they got the 2DX machine earlier last year.

914
01:17:32,328 --> 01:17:44,918
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I'm assuming that, you know, according to the thread, once I mention, you know, 12, that they'll try to plan to just go after getting that upgrade kit, same way they did for 10th.

915
01:17:46,135 --> 01:17:48,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And that surprises us when we manage to get 10th, you know?

916
01:18:09,063 --> 01:18:13,908
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it really depends, because in our area, I mean, we're having tournaments.

917
01:18:13,928 --> 01:18:18,313
[SPEAKER_12]: We're about to have a big tournament, hopefully in April, next month in Albany.

918
01:18:18,873 --> 01:18:25,520
[SPEAKER_12]: We already had a slew of smaller, low-level tournaments, one of which almost ended up in fighting, as I told you last time.

919
01:18:25,620 --> 01:18:26,781
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, I remember that.

920
01:18:26,861 --> 01:18:27,501
[SPEAKER_08]: With the drama?

921
01:18:27,581 --> 01:18:37,827
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there's one reason why you don't have the... No, but I mean, that was because of the locals who basically acted like assholes and, you know, basically started, you know, disrespecting other, you know, outsiders.

922
01:18:38,007 --> 01:18:39,568
[SPEAKER_12]: Outside players were beating them to it.

923
01:18:39,788 --> 01:18:42,269
[SPEAKER_12]: So what do you think is causing the decline out here, then?

924
01:18:42,929 --> 01:18:44,410
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not really that much of a decline.

925
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:45,871
[SPEAKER_12]: It really depends on where you go.

926
01:18:46,311 --> 01:18:48,073
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it depends on where a scene thrives.

927
01:18:48,113 --> 01:18:55,857
[SPEAKER_12]: I can understand where Northern California, you know, I can understand your scene over there because it's striving for something new, like in the group.

928
01:18:57,598 --> 01:19:03,122
[SPEAKER_12]: I think you're on the verge, in my honest opinion, you're on the verge of just switching on to more in-the-group tournaments.

929
01:19:04,905 --> 01:19:07,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I feel about that, though, to be honest.

930
01:19:07,246 --> 01:19:08,587
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how I feel about In The Groove.

931
01:19:09,307 --> 01:19:12,589
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, to be honest, though, In The Groove, I'm not sure about the freestyle part of it.

932
01:19:12,609 --> 01:19:14,371
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the problem.

933
01:19:14,651 --> 01:19:22,896
[SPEAKER_12]: In The Groove was made for Perfect Attack tournaments, but freestyle... Yes, the East Coast already held In The Groove tournaments and ate on the break late last year.

934
01:19:23,796 --> 01:19:24,837
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was a pretty good turnout.

935
01:19:25,852 --> 01:19:26,913
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't, I mean, I don't know.

936
01:19:27,033 --> 01:19:32,718
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it doesn't seem like the game's really that, I mean, you're always hearing about the thing.

937
01:19:32,758 --> 01:19:33,358
[SPEAKER_12]: It may be.

938
01:19:33,619 --> 01:19:41,545
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, I know it was built for, like, really, for, like, basically DDR on crack because of the fact that it's going to be on 10 foot and 10 feet.

939
01:19:41,805 --> 01:19:43,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, I mean, you're talking, like, 10 footers, 12, 13.

940
01:19:43,447 --> 01:19:44,728
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in the groove.

941
01:19:47,270 --> 01:19:48,651
[SPEAKER_12]: Well said!

942
01:19:48,931 --> 01:19:50,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Indigroove in a nutshell is DDR on crack!

943
01:19:51,373 --> 01:19:51,953
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it is!

944
01:19:52,033 --> 01:19:54,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Indigroove in a nutshell is DDR on crap!

945
01:19:56,976 --> 01:20:02,280
[SPEAKER_12]: But wait till Indigroove 2 comes out, and then you know, they're gonna start thinking.

946
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,742
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, I've been warming up to Indigroove.

947
01:20:04,822 --> 01:20:06,343
[SPEAKER_08]: I honestly cannot knock the game.

948
01:20:06,483 --> 01:20:06,623
[SPEAKER_08]: It's...

949
01:20:07,512 --> 01:20:08,573
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you've become desensitized.

950
01:20:08,593 --> 01:20:09,673
[SPEAKER_12]: Tournaments are pretty good.

951
01:20:10,414 --> 01:20:12,515
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, the tournament scene is still there.

952
01:20:12,575 --> 01:20:14,396
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, it needs something good.

953
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:16,257
[SPEAKER_12]: It needs something new to go on.

954
01:20:16,338 --> 01:20:17,018
[SPEAKER_10]: Para, para.

955
01:20:18,559 --> 01:20:19,760
[SPEAKER_10]: We need more para, para.

956
01:20:20,240 --> 01:20:23,822
[SPEAKER_12]: We were so grateful of managing to pull off a Nationals tournament last year.

957
01:20:24,423 --> 01:20:26,664
[SPEAKER_12]: And that created, that got a big turnout.

958
01:20:26,704 --> 01:20:29,566
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only that, we managed to expose DDR to a lot of things.

959
01:20:29,586 --> 01:20:31,447
[SPEAKER_12]: To a lot of people that probably never heard of it.

960
01:20:32,079 --> 01:20:34,504
[SPEAKER_12]: and we're getting DDR the limelight it deserves.

961
01:20:34,985 --> 01:20:43,543
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, you know, tournaments in fact are doing, you know, more great things for, you know, it depends on where it is though.

962
01:20:44,545 --> 01:20:45,065
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

963
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:06,553
[SPEAKER_12]: They're preparing, well, from what I heard, they are preparing for this year's.

964
01:21:07,294 --> 01:21:09,876
[SPEAKER_12]: They might do another Nationals tournament this year in October.

965
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,198
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all talk until something happens.

966
01:21:12,258 --> 01:21:17,823
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole exposure thing, though, I don't think it's necessarily that good of a thing.

967
01:21:17,963 --> 01:21:19,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but think about it.

968
01:21:19,204 --> 01:21:25,209
[SPEAKER_12]: It's in New York City, and you have mods such as Frequency Busting putting foot to ass trying to help, you know, help it get out there.

969
01:21:25,709 --> 01:21:29,570
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's usually when something gets to be a little too popular that it starts getting...

970
01:21:46,014 --> 01:21:48,356
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's basically what you make of it.

971
01:21:48,816 --> 01:21:57,881
[SPEAKER_12]: Whether or not you want to decide to pedal in the groove and in the groove 2, which is coming out, which could be an alternative to people who've been sucking on Xtreme for what now?

972
01:21:58,201 --> 01:21:59,142
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost two and a half years?

973
01:21:59,282 --> 01:22:01,143
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I mean, we will see.

974
01:22:01,203 --> 01:22:02,904
[SPEAKER_08]: That's really all we can say right now is we will see.

975
01:22:02,944 --> 01:22:06,466
[SPEAKER_08]: But we got to go because the Skype line is ringing.

976
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:08,347
[SPEAKER_08]: But is there any other final thought you have for us, Zaku?

977
01:22:09,508 --> 01:22:10,749
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, just, you know...

978
01:22:12,244 --> 01:22:17,886
[SPEAKER_12]: Just basically, you know, In The Groove 2 might, you know, just be ready in case.

979
01:22:18,546 --> 01:22:20,146
[SPEAKER_12]: Just try not, I don't know.

980
01:22:20,266 --> 01:22:23,347
[SPEAKER_08]: I will give In The Groove 2 a fair shot just like I gave In The Groove a fair shot.

981
01:22:23,387 --> 01:22:23,647
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

982
01:22:23,827 --> 01:22:25,068
[SPEAKER_12]: Just be even with it.

983
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:25,468
[SPEAKER_12]: Just be fair.

984
01:22:25,488 --> 01:22:26,188
[SPEAKER_08]: You promise, Jamie?

985
01:22:26,448 --> 01:22:26,908
[SPEAKER_08]: You promise?

986
01:22:27,048 --> 01:22:27,868
[SPEAKER_08]: Open mind, In The Groove?

987
01:22:28,349 --> 01:22:29,329
[SPEAKER_02]: At least be ajar.

988
01:22:29,969 --> 01:22:31,789
[SPEAKER_08]: I've still got to try it, you know.

989
01:22:31,889 --> 01:22:32,530
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Zach.

990
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:33,330
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, buddy.

991
01:22:33,810 --> 01:22:34,290
[SPEAKER_08]: Take care.

992
01:22:34,330 --> 01:22:34,870
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

993
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:36,471
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's take another call.

994
01:22:36,511 --> 01:22:37,471
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to this one.

995
01:22:39,057 --> 01:22:50,786
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio Merching from the shadows of Bermondi Style, here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLineXVI Hello, our resident 2DX bastard, what's on your mind?

996
01:22:52,447 --> 01:22:56,090
[SPEAKER_17]: I finally got my copy of 2DX Night Style Hurrah, what do you think?

997
01:22:56,751 --> 01:22:59,513
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, it's really good Did you get the one with all the stickers?

998
01:23:00,273 --> 01:23:06,578
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I don't have a sticker, I only have the regular edition I want all the DVDs and the stickers So what are your thoughts?

999
01:23:06,658 --> 01:23:07,399
[SPEAKER_17]: Tell us what you think

1000
01:23:08,286 --> 01:23:09,468
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really good, actually.

1001
01:23:09,508 --> 01:23:11,410
[SPEAKER_17]: It's almost like in the arcade version.

1002
01:23:11,430 --> 01:23:12,371
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh-oh.

1003
01:23:13,172 --> 01:23:14,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, what about the timing?

1004
01:23:14,113 --> 01:23:15,194
[SPEAKER_17]: We haven't talked about the timing.

1005
01:23:15,214 --> 01:23:16,876
[SPEAKER_17]: Specifically, not the timing.

1006
01:23:17,517 --> 01:23:18,618
[SPEAKER_02]: They think the timing's okay?

1007
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:20,360
[SPEAKER_02]: The timing is okay, actually.

1008
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:21,121
[SPEAKER_02]: I need mine.

1009
01:23:21,822 --> 01:23:24,626
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the deciding factor is the timing.

1010
01:23:24,666 --> 01:23:24,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Guys.

1011
01:23:26,286 --> 01:23:31,769
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say, because, you know, with the arcade there, of course, you're upgrading the hardware and stuff, so you've got the timing issues for that.

1012
01:23:32,349 --> 01:23:36,891
[SPEAKER_07]: But with the home version, it's pretty much just, you know, they reskin it, throw new songs in, you're done.

1013
01:23:37,071 --> 01:23:38,812
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's pretty much, you know, all for that.

1014
01:23:39,212 --> 01:23:44,634
[SPEAKER_07]: So, of course, the timing should be right on, you know, compared with some of the other ones, it should be just fine.

1015
01:23:44,774 --> 01:23:48,376
[SPEAKER_07]: So, anyways, you enjoy it?

1016
01:23:49,301 --> 01:23:50,922
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, of course I do enjoy it.

1017
01:23:51,322 --> 01:23:53,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Hey Sky, remember the videos that I sent you?

1018
01:23:53,402 --> 01:24:04,827
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so I was going to ask you, because you sent me actually one of your, you know, videos where you actually hooked it up, so you're playing 2DX, and you can see, you actually, like, you were playing Love Shine, and you see the notes falling.

1019
01:24:05,427 --> 01:24:07,968
[SPEAKER_17]: I did play Love Love Shine, it's one of my Tatsujin videos.

1020
01:24:07,988 --> 01:24:15,790
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, it's a new Tatsujin video, but you set it up in your house so that we can see your fingers playing the song instead of the typical video.

1021
01:24:16,090 --> 01:24:16,791
[SPEAKER_08]: How'd you set that up?

1022
01:24:16,811 --> 01:24:17,331
[SPEAKER_08]: That's pretty cool.

1023
01:24:18,362 --> 01:24:23,166
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you know, I use a tripod, I use a camcorder, and then I use my PC as my monitor.

1024
01:24:24,788 --> 01:24:25,048
[SPEAKER_17]: Huh.

1025
01:24:25,248 --> 01:24:31,394
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of which, I'm going to send you a link of what my setting looks like.

1026
01:24:31,474 --> 01:24:35,899
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, put that on our chat room, www.orangelaunchradio.com, clicking on chat.

1027
01:24:35,979 --> 01:24:39,382
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead and slap that up in our chat room so our folks there can check it out, the link.

1028
01:24:39,878 --> 01:24:41,979
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, this is what my setup looks like.

1029
01:24:42,200 --> 01:24:47,043
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now do you have a site where we can actually download the Tatsujin videos for those that want to see what this looks like?

1030
01:24:47,063 --> 01:24:50,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you going to throw them on Vimani style like everyone else that does Tatsujin videos?

1031
01:24:50,765 --> 01:24:54,207
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, mine is different, so... I got it from DustBacon.

1032
01:24:55,408 --> 01:24:56,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you really made out of iron?

1033
01:24:59,611 --> 01:25:02,813
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's a difference between Tatsujin and Tetsujin.

1034
01:25:03,794 --> 01:25:04,314
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, sorry.

1035
01:25:07,721 --> 01:25:14,306
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's the link for my Tatsujin videos, as well as a Seastar player and others.

1036
01:25:15,687 --> 01:25:21,892
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me log into my photobucket so I can give you the link to what my aesthetic looks like.

1037
01:25:21,992 --> 01:25:26,815
[SPEAKER_08]: While you're doing that, what would you say would be your favorite of the new consumer songs that are in 9th style?

1038
01:25:27,296 --> 01:25:29,598
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, my favorite... Here's a correction.

1039
01:25:29,718 --> 01:25:32,080
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not photogenic, it's photongenic.

1040
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:33,080
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, my bad.

1041
01:25:34,021 --> 01:25:34,782
[SPEAKER_09]: I read it quickly.

1042
01:25:36,286 --> 01:25:37,267
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Photongenic.

1043
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:41,249
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, my favorite.

1044
01:25:41,389 --> 01:25:42,210
[SPEAKER_17]: Is that your favorite?

1045
01:25:42,270 --> 01:25:44,571
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, Photongenic's my favorite.

1046
01:25:44,631 --> 01:25:48,093
[SPEAKER_17]: Other than that, it's also, I like Jaeger Final Attack.

1047
01:25:48,374 --> 01:25:50,755
[SPEAKER_09]: Jaeger Hamster Dance, as I call it.

1048
01:25:52,756 --> 01:25:55,278
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it just me, or has Denjin Jaeger gone fat?

1049
01:25:56,678 --> 01:26:00,740
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I haven't actually seen the video that goes along with the song just yet, so I couldn't really tell you that.

1050
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:02,000
[SPEAKER_17]: I do have the video.

1051
01:26:02,020 --> 01:26:04,161
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to have to send that to me at some point so I can check it out.

1052
01:26:04,561 --> 01:26:07,242
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll send it to you after this call.

1053
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:08,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sounds good.

1054
01:26:10,063 --> 01:26:11,944
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there anything else you wanted to say, Siggy?

1055
01:26:11,964 --> 01:26:15,445
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I've got to let you go to get somebody else here on the line, but is there anything else you wanted to say?

1056
01:26:16,986 --> 01:26:20,147
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing much else, but I'm just happy that I have my night style.

1057
01:26:20,402 --> 01:26:21,043
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds good.

1058
01:26:21,483 --> 01:26:24,305
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep us posted on any developments going on in the 2DX world.

1059
01:26:24,345 --> 01:26:27,587
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I already sent you the link to what my settings look like.

1060
01:26:27,848 --> 01:26:28,548
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, sounds good.

1061
01:26:29,569 --> 01:26:30,550
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll check that out in the chat room.

1062
01:26:31,070 --> 01:26:31,330
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

1063
01:26:31,450 --> 01:26:32,151
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, have a good one, bud.

1064
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:32,891
[SPEAKER_17]: Later.

1065
01:26:33,051 --> 01:26:33,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1066
01:26:34,272 --> 01:26:37,455
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, let's try to pick up a call here, if I can.

1067
01:26:40,197 --> 01:26:41,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1068
01:26:42,538 --> 01:26:43,499
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, it's Jimmy.

1069
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:44,660
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's up?

1070
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,360
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

1071
01:26:45,380 --> 01:26:45,861
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much?

1072
01:26:46,581 --> 01:26:47,061
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?

1073
01:26:47,081 --> 01:26:48,642
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta turn down my window real quick.

1074
01:26:48,722 --> 01:26:49,123
[SPEAKER_01]: There we go.

1075
01:26:49,223 --> 01:26:49,903
[SPEAKER_08]: That's alright, yes.

1076
01:26:50,023 --> 01:26:52,164
[SPEAKER_08]: First rule of calling into radio, turn off your radio.

1077
01:26:52,645 --> 01:26:53,926
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know how that is.

1078
01:26:54,066 --> 01:26:54,366
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1079
01:26:54,666 --> 01:26:54,926
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

1080
01:26:54,946 --> 01:26:55,406
[SPEAKER_08]: What's on your mind?

1081
01:26:57,108 --> 01:27:05,172
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going off of the first caller, the ITG, the way tournaments are going here in SoCal.

1082
01:27:05,212 --> 01:27:07,474
[SPEAKER_01]: It's basically all in the groove now.

1083
01:27:09,155 --> 01:27:11,937
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're saying in Southern California now, it's all about in the groove?

1084
01:27:12,317 --> 01:27:12,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1085
01:27:12,557 --> 01:27:13,418
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that include freestyle?

1086
01:27:13,438 --> 01:27:13,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

1087
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:29,355
[SPEAKER_01]: The first big one was in Stonewood, and everyone was pretty much going nuts, because you can see the percentages on the screen, and you get instant feedback while the people are playing, instead of having to count the greats while people are going.

1088
01:27:29,755 --> 01:27:40,159
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so you can kind of watch the scores go up, because In the Groove is one of those games where it's considered acceptable to use the scores as something that determines how well you do in the tournament.

1089
01:27:40,598 --> 01:27:44,379
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because basically everyone knows exactly how the scoring system works.

1090
01:27:44,399 --> 01:27:44,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1091
01:27:45,219 --> 01:27:48,060
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a good scoring system, I think.

1092
01:27:48,220 --> 01:27:53,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well, what I have to know, I have no doubt that In the Groove is a great game for tournaments, but I have to know, freestyle.

1093
01:27:54,281 --> 01:27:55,181
[SPEAKER_08]: How does freestyle work?

1094
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:59,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I've yet to see a freestyle tournament for it.

1095
01:27:59,562 --> 01:28:01,982
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only been... Yeah, there's a reason for that.

1096
01:28:02,002 --> 01:28:02,302
[SPEAKER_01]: Told you.

1097
01:28:02,422 --> 01:28:03,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Told you.

1098
01:28:03,043 --> 01:28:04,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the songs just aren't there.

1099
01:28:07,451 --> 01:28:14,196
[SPEAKER_01]: I've freestyled, and I really don't think there's a whole lot of freestyable songs on ITG.

1100
01:28:14,516 --> 01:28:16,878
[SPEAKER_08]: I really do.

1101
01:28:17,238 --> 01:28:20,040
[SPEAKER_01]: With the DDR crossovers, I guess we'll call them.

1102
01:28:20,260 --> 01:28:21,741
[SPEAKER_01]: That will definitely be cool.

1103
01:28:21,761 --> 01:28:23,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Follow the Sun and all that stuff.

1104
01:28:27,401 --> 01:28:29,662
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, anything else you wanted to share with us, my friend?

1105
01:28:30,602 --> 01:28:32,583
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping to get to the X-Night style soon.

1106
01:28:33,163 --> 01:28:35,364
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we all want it, but we're poor.

1107
01:28:36,184 --> 01:28:36,704
[SPEAKER_08]: What can we say?

1108
01:28:37,985 --> 01:28:40,906
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, free sound in the group doesn't really work.

1109
01:28:42,606 --> 01:28:44,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully they will fix that within the group too.

1110
01:28:44,507 --> 01:28:44,907
[SPEAKER_08]: We shall see.

1111
01:28:45,327 --> 01:28:46,207
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm hoping for.

1112
01:28:46,227 --> 01:28:47,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks a lot, guys.

1113
01:28:47,228 --> 01:28:47,588
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

1114
01:28:47,608 --> 01:28:48,128
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one, buddy.

1115
01:28:48,608 --> 01:28:48,888
[SPEAKER_08]: You too.

1116
01:28:48,988 --> 01:28:49,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1117
01:28:50,509 --> 01:28:53,049
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's take one more call.

1118
01:28:53,750 --> 01:28:54,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Tons Radio.

1119
01:28:56,249 --> 01:29:02,230
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the one and only token black cosplayer, Ranma.

1120
01:29:02,250 --> 01:29:03,391
[SPEAKER_05]: How you guys doing tonight?

1121
01:29:03,531 --> 01:29:05,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, our token black cosplayer friend.

1122
01:29:05,771 --> 01:29:06,151
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you?

1123
01:29:06,171 --> 01:29:07,731
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm good, I'm good.

1124
01:29:07,791 --> 01:29:10,512
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, you do have competition out here in the form of J-Ryoga.

1125
01:29:12,612 --> 01:29:13,653
[SPEAKER_08]: You know J-Ryoga H?

1126
01:29:14,193 --> 01:29:15,613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a long time.

1127
01:29:16,613 --> 01:29:17,533
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, he's one of my friends.

1128
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:18,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1129
01:29:19,174 --> 01:29:19,614
[SPEAKER_08]: Who knew?

1130
01:29:19,694 --> 01:29:20,234
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more than one.

1131
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:20,814
[SPEAKER_08]: Small world.

1132
01:29:21,054 --> 01:29:21,854
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more than one.

1133
01:29:22,755 --> 01:29:23,295
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up with that?

1134
01:29:23,575 --> 01:29:24,515
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you doing, my friend?

1135
01:29:25,129 --> 01:29:25,930
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing good.

1136
01:29:26,391 --> 01:29:28,875
[SPEAKER_05]: We had a cosplay photo shoot in Central Park today.

1137
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:30,958
[SPEAKER_05]: We got kicked out.

1138
01:29:34,002 --> 01:29:35,284
[SPEAKER_08]: Now this I have to hear about.

1139
01:29:35,344 --> 01:29:40,292
[SPEAKER_08]: So for those who don't know, because remember we have new listeners on tonight, what is cosplay, for those who don't know?

1140
01:29:41,044 --> 01:29:42,946
[SPEAKER_05]: Cosplay or Costume Play.

1141
01:29:43,006 --> 01:29:47,590
[SPEAKER_05]: You dress up as your favorite anime, video game, or manga characters at anime conventions.

1142
01:29:48,590 --> 01:29:55,716
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes this can be scantily clad females from fighting games, or this can be just like downright ugly guys from who knows what.

1143
01:29:56,637 --> 01:29:57,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Or, you know, whatever.

1144
01:29:57,878 --> 01:30:01,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Downright ugly guys cosplaying as scantily clad female video game players.

1145
01:30:01,541 --> 01:30:05,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, I've seen that too.

1146
01:30:05,665 --> 01:30:07,246
[SPEAKER_08]: So, okay, I have to know, how did you guys...

1147
01:30:08,078 --> 01:30:10,841
[SPEAKER_08]: What were you guys setting up to do in Central Park, and how did you get kicked out?

1148
01:30:10,901 --> 01:30:11,641
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what I have to know.

1149
01:30:12,102 --> 01:30:12,783
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just it.

1150
01:30:12,943 --> 01:30:14,464
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do anything.

1151
01:30:14,704 --> 01:30:17,607
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just taking pictures of ourselves in costumes and stuff.

1152
01:30:17,647 --> 01:30:18,968
[SPEAKER_05]: You were dressed up like freaks!

1153
01:30:19,208 --> 01:30:21,631
[SPEAKER_05]: You were freaks, and the freaks have to go!

1154
01:30:21,991 --> 01:30:23,572
[SPEAKER_05]: It was mostly hot EGL girls.

1155
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:30,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, were you guys all dressing up like ghosts in a big group and having a rally, and you know, then they might have kicked you out because of that?

1156
01:30:31,179 --> 01:30:32,160
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we were more...

1157
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,670
[SPEAKER_05]: More like, you know, less than that.

1158
01:30:34,690 --> 01:30:42,732
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know, whenever cosplay events in the park happen, like, say, in Tokyo, then a bajillion people take pictures of it and it ends up in Fruits Magazine, right?

1159
01:30:43,512 --> 01:30:47,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Right, but there was only like five people from outside that were walking around and took pictures of us.

1160
01:30:48,814 --> 01:30:53,135
[SPEAKER_08]: What I'm curious about, was it the scantily clad females that got you kicked out of Central Park?

1161
01:30:53,835 --> 01:30:54,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Nope.

1162
01:30:54,195 --> 01:30:58,216
[SPEAKER_05]: It seems that you need a permit to take pictures in Central Park.

1163
01:30:59,301 --> 01:30:59,541
[SPEAKER_08]: What?

1164
01:30:59,681 --> 01:31:02,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody and their mother was going to Central Park to take pictures of the gates.

1165
01:31:02,922 --> 01:31:04,423
[SPEAKER_08]: Did they get a permit for that?

1166
01:31:05,023 --> 01:31:05,583
[SPEAKER_08]: That's just it.

1167
01:31:05,603 --> 01:31:06,524
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we argued.

1168
01:31:06,764 --> 01:31:11,205
[SPEAKER_05]: They said because it's for commercial purposes, we need a permit.

1169
01:31:11,245 --> 01:31:14,746
[SPEAKER_05]: And on the weekends, we need special permission from the mayor.

1170
01:31:15,807 --> 01:31:16,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

1171
01:31:17,227 --> 01:31:19,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Is this for commercial purposes?

1172
01:31:19,568 --> 01:31:21,409
[SPEAKER_05]: No, this is for amateur stuff for our websites.

1173
01:31:22,309 --> 01:31:22,929
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my gosh.

1174
01:31:23,269 --> 01:31:25,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I say next time you're there, burn down the gates.

1175
01:31:26,912 --> 01:31:27,813
[SPEAKER_08]: Gator already gone.

1176
01:31:28,293 --> 01:31:28,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Damn.

1177
01:31:28,673 --> 01:31:29,454
[SPEAKER_08]: See?

1178
01:31:29,574 --> 01:31:30,355
[SPEAKER_08]: Mission accomplished!

1179
01:31:32,096 --> 01:31:34,018
[SPEAKER_07]: They've been replaced by Altercade machines.

1180
01:31:34,738 --> 01:31:36,840
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's just so ridiculous.

1181
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:41,123
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I used to do LARP vampire games in Alabama.

1182
01:31:41,143 --> 01:31:43,765
[SPEAKER_08]: And we were just all kinds of insane.

1183
01:31:43,945 --> 01:31:48,188
[SPEAKER_08]: Alabama parking lot or whatever you did is slightly different than Central Park.

1184
01:31:48,228 --> 01:31:51,891
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we would do it in downtown Mobile at Bienville Square.

1185
01:31:52,051 --> 01:31:52,732
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, okay.

1186
01:31:53,528 --> 01:31:54,048
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

1187
01:31:54,589 --> 01:31:55,709
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a historical landmark.

1188
01:31:55,749 --> 01:31:57,690
[SPEAKER_08]: They should have told them it was for a school project.

1189
01:31:57,710 --> 01:31:59,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a historical landmark.

1190
01:31:59,531 --> 01:32:00,011
[SPEAKER_08]: We did.

1191
01:32:00,192 --> 01:32:01,592
[SPEAKER_02]: And we never got anything for it.

1192
01:32:01,632 --> 01:32:04,954
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's the easy excuse whenever you need to get out of something.

1193
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:06,895
[SPEAKER_08]: It's for a school project.

1194
01:32:06,935 --> 01:32:08,736
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't know we were doing it.

1195
01:32:09,156 --> 01:32:09,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Not this time.

1196
01:32:11,897 --> 01:32:12,278
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1197
01:32:13,098 --> 01:32:15,719
[SPEAKER_08]: Anything going on in your gaming world you want to share with us, buddy?

1198
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:19,141
[SPEAKER_05]: I was at the PSP release at my job.

1199
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:21,182
[SPEAKER_05]: We sold 260 of them.

1200
01:32:21,202 --> 01:32:22,843
[SPEAKER_05]: 20 came back.

1201
01:32:24,608 --> 01:32:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: and 15 came back the next day.

1202
01:32:26,508 --> 01:32:29,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the dead pixel thing that's going on with the new PSPs I'm hearing about?

1203
01:32:29,589 --> 01:32:30,969
[SPEAKER_05]: They're too anal.

1204
01:32:31,449 --> 01:32:33,290
[SPEAKER_08]: So, are they really that bad?

1205
01:32:33,330 --> 01:32:33,890
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you seen them?

1206
01:32:34,510 --> 01:32:34,890
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1207
01:32:36,730 --> 01:32:37,951
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are, some aren't.

1208
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:40,391
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we're Geek Squad, we have to take a look at these things.

1209
01:32:40,791 --> 01:32:43,392
[SPEAKER_08]: We got Dan, who's actually a manager of a GameStop in town.

1210
01:32:43,412 --> 01:32:45,612
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, very minor and these people are too anal.

1211
01:32:45,652 --> 01:32:46,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, I got... You know what?

1212
01:32:46,772 --> 01:32:49,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you send me some of those defective PSPs?

1213
01:32:49,093 --> 01:32:50,073
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I'll take them off your hands.

1214
01:32:51,073 --> 01:32:52,234
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, don't you think I tried?

1215
01:32:53,995 --> 01:32:55,195
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, quote unquote defective.

1216
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:57,117
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, Dan, I know you're dying to say something.

1217
01:32:58,477 --> 01:33:05,742
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are bitching about one or two dead pixels on their PSPs are anal retentive bastards who should be shot on sight.

1218
01:33:07,242 --> 01:33:07,803
[SPEAKER_05]: No shit.

1219
01:33:08,683 --> 01:33:09,124
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

1220
01:33:09,924 --> 01:33:10,524
[SPEAKER_05]: You're welcome.

1221
01:33:10,804 --> 01:33:16,328
[SPEAKER_00]: The official line now is, we don't take them back, they gotta go to Sony if they have dead pixels.

1222
01:33:16,368 --> 01:33:17,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sony doesn't care.

1223
01:33:17,789 --> 01:33:19,109
[SPEAKER_00]: No, Sony does care.

1224
01:33:19,209 --> 01:33:20,170
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony is replacing them.

1225
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:21,294
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they really?

1226
01:33:21,354 --> 01:33:23,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is very, very decent of Sony.

1227
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:28,758
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, what you're going to get back is another dead pixel PSP that they fixed.

1228
01:33:29,939 --> 01:33:30,779
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know.

1229
01:33:31,620 --> 01:33:35,942
[SPEAKER_00]: But as for anyone who has problems with dead pixels on their PSP, stick with it.

1230
01:33:36,022 --> 01:33:38,143
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll either go away or you'll adjust.

1231
01:33:38,983 --> 01:33:42,265
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, out of the gajillions of pixels, if one or two are dead, hey, consider yourself lucky.

1232
01:33:42,305 --> 01:33:43,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have a couple dozen.

1233
01:33:44,306 --> 01:33:45,086
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be mad.

1234
01:33:45,767 --> 01:33:45,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1235
01:33:46,941 --> 01:33:54,784
[SPEAKER_08]: 30 people Well, you know, considering how much they charge for those things, though, you'd think the thing would run absolutely perfectly.

1236
01:33:55,144 --> 01:33:56,024
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the only issue.

1237
01:33:56,044 --> 01:33:57,265
[SPEAKER_08]: You ever bought a tire for your car?

1238
01:33:58,045 --> 01:33:58,445
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1239
01:33:58,525 --> 01:33:59,125
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it go flat?

1240
01:34:00,706 --> 01:34:01,886
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but they replaced it for free.

1241
01:34:02,346 --> 01:34:03,947
[SPEAKER_00]: LCD screens have dead pixels.

1242
01:34:04,147 --> 01:34:05,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Sony will replace it for free.

1243
01:34:06,608 --> 01:34:07,188
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's it.

1244
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:08,288
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens.

1245
01:34:10,069 --> 01:34:10,969
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have it lucky.

1246
01:34:11,009 --> 01:34:12,190
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to take them back.

1247
01:34:12,250 --> 01:34:12,830
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to.

1248
01:34:13,890 --> 01:34:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you work?

1249
01:34:15,151 --> 01:34:15,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Best Buy.

1250
01:34:18,305 --> 01:34:20,647
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, is that because you sell that extra insurance or whatever?

1251
01:34:21,407 --> 01:34:23,729
[SPEAKER_05]: Even without the extra insurance, they bring it back.

1252
01:34:24,389 --> 01:34:28,212
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to take it back, we stamp it out, de-vote, we send it back to the manufacturer.

1253
01:34:28,272 --> 01:34:31,674
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, Sony doesn't reimburse the manufacturer for that return.

1254
01:34:32,354 --> 01:34:34,676
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to take out your frustration on the whole machine.

1255
01:34:36,096 --> 01:34:39,799
[SPEAKER_05]: We get most of it back, like 85% of the value we get back, more or less.

1256
01:34:39,959 --> 01:34:43,701
[SPEAKER_00]: They won't do it with the dead pixels because they don't consider those to be a defect.

1257
01:34:44,822 --> 01:34:45,042
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

1258
01:34:46,120 --> 01:34:47,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Best Buy's policy will change.

1259
01:34:47,481 --> 01:34:49,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, I think they're doing the right thing.

1260
01:34:49,642 --> 01:34:56,245
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, hey, if we had 100 extra systems in stock, and I had 10 people wanting to bring them back and exchange them, hey, no problem.

1261
01:34:56,725 --> 01:35:06,410
[SPEAKER_00]: But, according to Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, their whole take on it is, this is how PSPs are, there's a problem with the pixels, you send them to us, we'll take care of it.

1262
01:35:06,857 --> 01:35:07,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't bother the retailer.

1263
01:35:08,179 --> 01:35:11,583
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the smaller retailers have said, hey, we can't take them back for that reason.

1264
01:35:11,603 --> 01:35:14,046
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't this supposed to be virtually invisible anyway when you're playing?

1265
01:35:14,807 --> 01:35:18,352
[SPEAKER_00]: In game, you don't see it unless it's a solid color screen.

1266
01:35:18,933 --> 01:35:22,337
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or from what I was told, when you turn it off, you see the dead pixels.

1267
01:35:22,538 --> 01:35:24,260
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, and that's the thing is these people, they're not...

1268
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:28,561
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not, you know, trying it for a couple hours and saying, wow, this doesn't interrupt my gameplay.

1269
01:35:28,941 --> 01:35:33,983
[SPEAKER_00]: They turn it on on the boot up screen, see a pixel that's green when it should be white, and lose their minds.

1270
01:35:34,003 --> 01:35:35,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it makes sense after they just spent $250 on it.

1271
01:35:36,624 --> 01:35:42,446
[SPEAKER_00]: If they'd run the Spider-Man DVD through it, 90% of the time the pixels unfreeze since they're just frozen, not dead.

1272
01:35:43,366 --> 01:35:44,367
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, weird.

1273
01:35:44,647 --> 01:35:45,627
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, that's weird.

1274
01:35:46,107 --> 01:35:50,349
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing is, two months down the road, you might have a whole different set of dead pixels.

1275
01:35:51,636 --> 01:35:53,897
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not like you're going to get one that's going to work forever.

1276
01:35:54,217 --> 01:35:55,278
[SPEAKER_00]: LCD screens do that.

1277
01:35:55,778 --> 01:35:57,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyone who has an LCD monitor can tell you that.

1278
01:35:57,659 --> 01:36:01,361
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard the dead pixel thing going on with the DS as well, so it's not just, you know, PSP.

1279
01:36:01,561 --> 01:36:03,222
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nature of technology.

1280
01:36:03,602 --> 01:36:04,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, we've got to let you go, bud.

1281
01:36:05,062 --> 01:36:05,943
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got to let you go, bud.

1282
01:36:06,163 --> 01:36:06,843
[SPEAKER_08]: But have a good one.

1283
01:36:06,883 --> 01:36:08,184
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for calling us.

1284
01:36:08,344 --> 01:36:08,904
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, later.

1285
01:36:09,565 --> 01:36:13,206
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got to take one more because this guy's been calling us pretty constantly.

1286
01:36:13,747 --> 01:36:16,128
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to do one more and then we're going to get into the cage.

1287
01:36:16,148 --> 01:36:16,688
[SPEAKER_08]: You're so kind.

1288
01:36:16,708 --> 01:36:17,388
[SPEAKER_08]: I know, I'm so kind.

1289
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

1290
01:36:21,189 --> 01:36:21,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello.

1291
01:36:24,431 --> 01:36:25,111
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear us?

1292
01:36:25,212 --> 01:36:25,912
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, hey.

1293
01:36:26,292 --> 01:36:27,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, there you are.

1294
01:36:27,373 --> 01:36:27,713
[SPEAKER_08]: What's up?

1295
01:36:30,435 --> 01:36:31,636
[SPEAKER_17]: So, what's up?

1296
01:36:31,716 --> 01:36:32,336
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, who's this?

1297
01:36:34,337 --> 01:36:35,278
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that might be really bad.

1298
01:36:35,338 --> 01:36:36,339
[SPEAKER_08]: This is my mom.

1299
01:36:37,519 --> 01:36:38,040
[SPEAKER_08]: We can hear you.

1300
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:38,880
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear us, buddy?

1301
01:36:41,762 --> 01:36:42,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you hear me now?

1302
01:36:42,502 --> 01:36:43,243
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think he can hear us.

1303
01:36:44,003 --> 01:36:44,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, bud.

1304
01:36:44,764 --> 01:36:45,264
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't hear you.

1305
01:36:46,125 --> 01:36:46,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, he hung up on us.

1306
01:36:47,606 --> 01:36:48,706
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we tried.

1307
01:36:48,746 --> 01:36:49,227
[SPEAKER_08]: We tried.

1308
01:36:49,387 --> 01:36:49,687
[SPEAKER_08]: We tried.

1309
01:36:51,139 --> 01:36:56,464
[SPEAKER_08]: For those of you guys that are still trying to get in, thanks, but we are going to just come back to this later.

1310
01:36:56,564 --> 01:36:59,587
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do the match game, don't forget, we've got that coming up a little later on.

1311
01:36:59,887 --> 01:37:03,090
[SPEAKER_08]: But for now we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1312
01:37:03,931 --> 01:37:10,658
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for those of you guys unfamiliar with the Cage Match, the way it works, we're going to play three songs for you guys.

1313
01:37:11,705 --> 01:37:15,108
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're going to play three songs, and you guys have to be in the chat room to vote.

1314
01:37:15,588 --> 01:37:18,230
[SPEAKER_08]: www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

1315
01:37:18,731 --> 01:37:27,998
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will play these songs, and then you're going to pick your favorite, and your favorite song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music and More program.

1316
01:37:28,018 --> 01:37:30,620
[SPEAKER_03]: And the winner gets a break from having to pick a song mixed with each other.

1317
01:37:30,700 --> 01:37:31,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right.

1318
01:37:31,221 --> 01:37:37,906
[SPEAKER_08]: So, Jamie, it's your break because you won last week, and it's Yoko Kanno, and the song is Rise.

1319
01:37:38,006 --> 01:37:41,670
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, remember, there's no rhyme or reason for why we picked these songs.

1320
01:37:41,770 --> 01:37:45,933
[SPEAKER_08]: It's three songs we like, you pick your favorite, and it goes in rotation.

1321
01:37:46,534 --> 01:37:46,694
[SPEAKER_19]: Yep.

1322
01:37:47,014 --> 01:37:48,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so here it is.

1323
01:37:48,455 --> 01:37:50,777
[SPEAKER_08]: You only get a clip of this song, though, because it did win last week.

1324
01:37:50,818 --> 01:37:51,378
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's a clip.

1325
01:37:51,698 --> 01:37:54,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno, Rise.

1326
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:54,561
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1327
01:40:00,273 --> 01:40:02,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one.

1328
01:40:02,134 --> 01:40:03,994
[SPEAKER_08]: That was Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1329
01:40:04,074 --> 01:40:06,715
[SPEAKER_08]: And now you get to hear two new songs in their entirety.

1330
01:40:07,096 --> 01:40:09,576
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to start it off with my pick for tonight's Cage Match.

1331
01:40:09,636 --> 01:40:14,238
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, you might remember, or you may not if this is your first time listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1332
01:40:14,278 --> 01:40:15,018
[SPEAKER_08]: If so, welcome.

1333
01:40:15,479 --> 01:40:18,220
[SPEAKER_08]: But we've retired a couple songs from the Cage Match.

1334
01:40:18,240 --> 01:40:20,741
[SPEAKER_08]: When a song wins four times, we retire it.

1335
01:40:21,141 --> 01:40:24,702
[SPEAKER_08]: And the first song that ever got retired was a Top 40 hit.

1336
01:40:24,822 --> 01:40:26,163
[SPEAKER_08]: It was Gwen Stefani, remember that?

1337
01:40:26,783 --> 01:40:26,963
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1338
01:40:27,825 --> 01:40:30,828
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to try... I'm going to try... Hey, hey, you watch it.

1339
01:40:30,928 --> 01:40:31,989
[SPEAKER_08]: I like my Gwen, okay?

1340
01:40:32,169 --> 01:40:36,352
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm going to try my Top 40 luck again because I love this chick.

1341
01:40:36,432 --> 01:40:36,813
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1342
01:40:36,893 --> 01:40:37,933
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't roll your eyes at me.

1343
01:40:39,335 --> 01:40:41,877
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, the listeners don't see that.

1344
01:40:43,878 --> 01:40:45,260
[SPEAKER_08]: They do when I get upset.

1345
01:40:45,920 --> 01:40:46,220
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1346
01:40:46,821 --> 01:40:48,542
[SPEAKER_08]: So anyway, I'm going to try my Top 40 luck.

1347
01:40:48,562 --> 01:40:50,404
[SPEAKER_08]: What, what, what, what?

1348
01:40:50,444 --> 01:40:50,624
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1349
01:40:50,704 --> 01:40:51,945
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi.

1350
01:40:52,085 --> 01:40:54,867
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to do a dance remix, though, of a Top 40 hit.

1351
01:40:55,528 --> 01:40:56,409
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is...

1352
01:40:57,518 --> 01:40:59,659
[SPEAKER_07]: One of those stupid Hataway songs again.

1353
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:00,580
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Hataway.

1354
01:41:00,620 --> 01:41:02,540
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually Kelly Clarkson.

1355
01:41:04,802 --> 01:41:06,082
[SPEAKER_08]: Get the zero automatically.

1356
01:41:06,182 --> 01:41:06,743
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no, no.

1357
01:41:06,803 --> 01:41:07,643
[SPEAKER_08]: You listen to it first.

1358
01:41:07,723 --> 01:41:08,723
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, so it's a bathroom break.

1359
01:41:08,783 --> 01:41:10,404
[SPEAKER_08]: This is Kelly Clarkson.

1360
01:41:10,484 --> 01:41:11,125
[SPEAKER_08]: You haters.

1361
01:41:12,105 --> 01:41:17,428
[SPEAKER_08]: The song is Since You Been Gone, and it's the Jason Nevins Rock the Club mix.

1362
01:41:17,488 --> 01:41:17,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy, guys.

1363
01:41:29,810 --> 01:41:32,151
[SPEAKER_19]: And all you'd ever need

1364
01:42:17,592 --> 01:42:43,662
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks to you, now I get what I want Since you've been gone How can I put it, you put me on I even fell for that stupid love song Yeah, yeah, since you've been gone How come I never hear

1365
01:42:46,528 --> 01:43:02,077
[SPEAKER_19]: I just wanna be with you Guess you never felt that way But since you've been gone I can't breathe for the first time I'm so moving on, yeah, yeah Thanks to you, now I get

1366
01:43:20,675 --> 01:43:26,281
[SPEAKER_19]: I just can't say again Again and again and again and again Did you think I would?

1367
01:44:01,298 --> 01:44:03,381
Thank you for watching!

1368
01:44:32,626 --> 01:44:33,487
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura.com

1369
01:45:00,976 --> 01:45:03,458
[SPEAKER_03]: I've rocked something and now I have to go to the bathroom.

1370
01:45:04,459 --> 01:45:06,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets a three.

1371
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:08,041
[SPEAKER_00]: No more talking for you.

1372
01:45:09,482 --> 01:45:10,263
[SPEAKER_13]: Shut up, man.

1373
01:45:10,323 --> 01:45:11,604
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan the Man, since you have a mic.

1374
01:45:11,624 --> 01:45:13,065
[SPEAKER_13]: Get in the kitchen and make me a pie.

1375
01:45:14,145 --> 01:45:16,387
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan the Man, since you have a mic, what do you think of Since You've Been Gone?

1376
01:45:16,567 --> 01:45:17,167
[SPEAKER_08]: Unimpressive.

1377
01:45:17,968 --> 01:45:18,769
[SPEAKER_08]: On a scale of one to ten?

1378
01:45:19,769 --> 01:45:20,330
[SPEAKER_07]: Negative four.

1379
01:45:20,790 --> 01:45:21,531
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Loki.

1380
01:45:22,892 --> 01:45:25,453
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no amount of alcohol in this world that would make that song good.

1381
01:45:26,434 --> 01:45:27,295
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awful.

1382
01:45:27,795 --> 01:45:30,577
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you could remix that song to hell and it would still suck.

1383
01:45:30,987 --> 01:45:31,847
[SPEAKER_07]: So, guess what?

1384
01:45:32,127 --> 01:45:33,067
[SPEAKER_07]: It gets a 1.

1385
01:45:33,928 --> 01:45:34,968
[SPEAKER_07]: Because it's Killing Clarkson.

1386
01:45:34,988 --> 01:45:35,948
[SPEAKER_07]: What were you thinking?

1387
01:45:36,408 --> 01:45:37,228
[SPEAKER_07]: No, bad.

1388
01:45:37,668 --> 01:45:38,428
[SPEAKER_07]: And you flipped me off.

1389
01:45:38,448 --> 01:45:38,769
[SPEAKER_07]: Bad Rob.

1390
01:45:39,409 --> 01:45:43,750
[SPEAKER_08]: This coming from the guy who brings his girlfriend over every Tuesday to watch American Idol.

1391
01:45:45,770 --> 01:45:48,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Doesn't mean I'm going to buy any of their albums, okay?

1392
01:45:48,490 --> 01:45:50,011
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey, they gave us clay.

1393
01:45:50,131 --> 01:45:52,271
[SPEAKER_07]: I like reality TV sometimes.

1394
01:45:52,391 --> 01:45:55,912
[SPEAKER_07]: Just because I watch reality TV does not mean that I'm going to buy the music.

1395
01:45:56,570 --> 01:45:58,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Clay Aiken is funny looking.

1396
01:45:58,171 --> 01:46:00,011
[SPEAKER_08]: Kelly Clarkson is a hot mama.

1397
01:46:00,292 --> 01:46:02,212
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay Aiken is funny looking.

1398
01:46:02,933 --> 01:46:03,233
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway.

1399
01:46:04,954 --> 01:46:05,294
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1400
01:46:07,335 --> 01:46:14,177
[SPEAKER_08]: I think you people who, especially considering some of the DDR songs you guys like, need to respect Kelly a little more.

1401
01:46:14,237 --> 01:46:14,918
[SPEAKER_08]: I give it like a 9.

1402
01:46:15,298 --> 01:46:15,938
[SPEAKER_08]: It's cool.

1403
01:46:15,958 --> 01:46:16,678
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that remix.

1404
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:18,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Angel.

1405
01:46:20,180 --> 01:46:21,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I like girly stuff.

1406
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:21,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes.

1407
01:46:22,381 --> 01:46:24,001
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's okay.

1408
01:46:24,162 --> 01:46:24,422
[SPEAKER_03]: So, 5.

1409
01:46:27,031 --> 01:46:28,852
[SPEAKER_08]: God, I can't even get a pity vote from Angel.

1410
01:46:28,932 --> 01:46:29,313
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1411
01:46:32,435 --> 01:46:35,397
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see how Loki's song spares tonight's cage match.

1412
01:46:35,437 --> 01:46:36,678
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1413
01:46:36,738 --> 01:46:37,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Last song.

1414
01:46:38,359 --> 01:46:42,682
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked the song from everyone's favorite Kill Bill soundtrack artist.

1415
01:46:44,717 --> 01:46:46,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I'm going to butcher this name.

1416
01:46:46,458 --> 01:46:47,699
[SPEAKER_07]: You picked something at random.

1417
01:46:47,759 --> 01:46:49,460
[SPEAKER_07]: I picked something, yeah.

1418
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:56,764
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I had three of those bottle caps from Pepsi sitting here at my desk, and I was like, God damn it, I've got to go on iTunes now and get something.

1419
01:46:57,284 --> 01:47:05,689
[SPEAKER_07]: So today I found this guy, and of course you'll recognize him from his ever-famous song, A Battle Without Honor or Humanity.

1420
01:47:06,129 --> 01:47:09,991
[SPEAKER_07]: This is Frozen Memories by, I only remember the guy's name.

1421
01:47:12,782 --> 01:47:15,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Try Tomoyasu Hote.

1422
01:47:15,287 --> 01:47:15,948
[SPEAKER_08]: How does that sound right?

1423
01:47:16,389 --> 01:47:16,930
[SPEAKER_07]: That'd be it.

1424
01:47:17,211 --> 01:47:17,752
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, here it is.

1425
01:47:18,734 --> 01:47:21,860
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number three, Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.

1426
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Enjoy.

1427
01:51:13,591 --> 01:51:15,411
It was not too bad, but kind of generic.

1428
01:51:41,130 --> 01:51:43,032
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets a solid 7.

1429
01:51:45,233 --> 01:51:45,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1430
01:51:46,895 --> 01:51:47,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel, what did you think of that?

1431
01:51:48,876 --> 01:51:49,377
[SPEAKER_04]: I liked it.

1432
01:51:49,717 --> 01:51:49,377
8.

1433
01:51:51,458 --> 01:51:54,881
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought it was good, but not as good as Kelly Clarkson.

1434
01:51:55,141 --> 01:51:54,881
7.5.

1435
01:51:55,862 --> 01:51:59,625
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, what did you think of Tomiyasu Hotei?

1436
01:52:01,286 --> 01:52:01,786
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it.

1437
01:52:02,387 --> 01:52:06,870
[SPEAKER_07]: It was interesting because I was very tempted to put in Battle Without Honor and Humanity for another...

1438
01:52:08,416 --> 01:52:09,417
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the wailing guitar sound.

1439
01:52:09,497 --> 01:52:10,558
[SPEAKER_07]: It was totally sweet.

1440
01:52:10,598 --> 01:52:11,959
[SPEAKER_07]: That song would rock in Guitar Freaks.

1441
01:52:11,979 --> 01:52:12,940
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it definitely gets at least an 8.

1442
01:52:32,386 --> 01:52:34,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe 8.725.

1443
01:52:35,667 --> 01:52:36,127
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1444
01:52:36,147 --> 01:52:36,687
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally hard.

1445
01:52:36,867 --> 01:52:37,227
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.

1446
01:52:37,267 --> 01:52:38,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay guys, it's time to vote.

1447
01:52:38,748 --> 01:52:40,628
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember, you have to be in our chatroom to vote.

1448
01:52:41,048 --> 01:52:46,050
[SPEAKER_08]: Everything we have said to this point doesn't matter because it's you guys that make the ultimate decision.

1449
01:52:46,070 --> 01:52:47,090
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is, one more time.

1450
01:52:47,490 --> 01:52:49,771
[SPEAKER_08]: Song number one, Yoko Kanno with Rise.

1451
01:52:58,630 --> 01:53:02,911
[SPEAKER_08]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Kelly Clarkson, Since You've Been Gone, Jason Nevins edit.

[SPEAKER_08]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.

1453

[SPEAKER_08]: Place vote now!

1454
01:53:27,796 --> 01:53:31,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1455
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:34,020
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one that gets the most votes will walk away the winner.

1456
01:53:34,481 --> 01:53:34,981
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, Loki.

1457
01:53:35,381 --> 01:53:42,246
[SPEAKER_07]: And in case the viewing public was unsure of who the mystery person was, well, I don't know.

1458
01:53:42,526 --> 01:53:43,587
[SPEAKER_07]: Rob, do you want to explain?

1459
01:53:44,007 --> 01:53:44,768
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, did he go?

1460
01:53:44,788 --> 01:53:45,328
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he's gone.

1461
01:53:45,368 --> 01:53:46,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We gave him our contact information.

1462
01:53:47,150 --> 01:53:47,610
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool.

1463
01:53:48,658 --> 01:53:50,399
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, just so you guys know.

1464
01:53:50,419 --> 01:53:52,000
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw you guys, I'm going home.

1465
01:53:52,020 --> 01:54:00,544
[SPEAKER_08]: If the show sounded a little weird just then, and you noticed we were doing some different stuff, there was a photographer from a local paper that was here taking pictures for like the past hour.

1466
01:54:00,584 --> 01:54:01,244
[SPEAKER_08]: He was here a long time.

1467
01:54:01,324 --> 01:54:02,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, he was on the webcam.

1468
01:54:02,485 --> 01:54:04,726
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, so yeah, maybe he's on the webcam.

1469
01:54:05,246 --> 01:54:06,407
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's what was going on.

1470
01:54:06,957 --> 01:54:08,198
[SPEAKER_07]: We're famous!

1471
01:54:08,238 --> 01:54:09,339
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be famous!

1472
01:54:09,399 --> 01:54:10,280
[SPEAKER_13]: We're going to be in the paper!

1473
01:54:10,600 --> 01:54:12,301
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, we'll see what happens with that.

1474
01:54:12,622 --> 01:54:15,344
[SPEAKER_08]: I really hope they got a shot of Jamie while she was in mid-air.

1475
01:54:16,284 --> 01:54:30,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I saw the camera right here, like a couple close-up shots of me going... You know what's funny is that when he first showed up, he thought our whole show was us dancing while talking.

1476
01:54:32,197 --> 01:54:34,559
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, you want us to dance?

1477
01:54:35,327 --> 01:54:36,548
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, Dance Monkey Dance.

1478
01:54:37,889 --> 01:54:39,030
[SPEAKER_07]: We're like, free publicity?

1479
01:54:39,050 --> 01:54:39,831
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, we'll get out the pad.

1480
01:54:39,851 --> 01:54:41,112
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's dance.

1481
01:54:41,392 --> 01:54:42,173
[SPEAKER_09]: What else do you want me to do?

1482
01:54:42,433 --> 01:54:43,013
[SPEAKER_08]: Eh, it's cool.

1483
01:54:43,133 --> 01:54:43,654
[SPEAKER_08]: It works out.

1484
01:54:43,814 --> 01:54:44,174
[SPEAKER_09]: It's fun.

1485
01:54:44,875 --> 01:54:47,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, anyway, finish your votes there.

1486
01:54:47,997 --> 01:54:49,318
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them over a private message to Sky.

1487
01:54:49,739 --> 01:54:53,842
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, as long as you got the microphone there, tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.

1488
01:54:54,122 --> 01:54:56,124
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, not too much as it was last week.

1489
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:59,106
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still waiting for some actual sim files to come out.

1490
01:54:59,266 --> 01:55:04,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, if I remember correctly, there was that Setmania pack that's coming out with a bunch of songs called, uh,

1491
01:55:05,527 --> 01:55:35,247
[SPEAKER_07]: DDR, uh, it's like XXMix or something like that, oh, there's some link on, um, there's some link on the actual, um, Bomani style site that, um, they have there, and they were saying there was going to be an April 1st release for that, so, look for that, there's a whole thread to it, and, um, so that'd be pretty interesting, other than that, um, oh, um, pretty soon, DDR UK's relaunching pretty soon, should be this week, actually, I think Monday or Tuesday, I can't remember,

1492
01:55:35,663 --> 01:55:40,127
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're coming back, and DDR Mania X is saying that they're coming back at some point.

1493
01:55:40,407 --> 01:55:42,830
[SPEAKER_07]: But actually, DDR UK, they are saying they're coming back.

1494
01:55:42,850 --> 01:55:43,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Monday, Tuesday.

1495
01:55:43,871 --> 01:55:45,652
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't remember what exactly the day is on that.

1496
01:55:46,453 --> 01:55:49,576
[SPEAKER_07]: But they're coming back, so look for good stuff from them.

1497
01:55:50,697 --> 01:56:00,046
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know what the situation is with SimFiles, what they're going to be doing, because I think the reason they got taken down the first time was because they had licensed music on there and that kind of stuff.

1498
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:02,451
[SPEAKER_07]: So look forward to that.

1499
01:56:02,631 --> 01:56:03,752
[SPEAKER_07]: That should be pretty exciting.

1500
01:56:03,792 --> 01:56:05,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just glad that I'll have more websites to read again.

1501
01:56:06,673 --> 01:56:11,156
[SPEAKER_07]: And really, other than that, not too much else going on.

1502
01:56:11,316 --> 01:56:13,637
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some sim files out there that are pretty interesting.

1503
01:56:14,458 --> 01:56:16,519
[SPEAKER_07]: More crappy remixes, of course, out there.

1504
01:56:17,320 --> 01:56:20,281
[SPEAKER_07]: But they give me some ideas for stuff, so I may look to doing that.

1505
01:56:20,481 --> 01:56:24,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been kind of hitting a musician's block lately, so I haven't been making anything.

1506
01:56:25,504 --> 01:56:27,345
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, lots of fun stuff out there.

1507
01:56:28,206 --> 01:56:30,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Go download some music, songs.

1508
01:56:30,928 --> 01:56:33,830
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's it.

1509
01:56:35,791 --> 01:56:36,111
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

1510
01:56:37,251 --> 01:56:38,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1511
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:40,813
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to take the last call for cage match votes now.

1512
01:56:41,934 --> 01:56:43,755
[SPEAKER_08]: So hopefully you guys are getting those votes in.

1513
01:56:43,995 --> 01:56:48,977
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we're going to do, we're going to take a break and we're going to come back and play Match Game.

1514
01:56:49,578 --> 01:56:51,399
[SPEAKER_08]: And Match Game tonight has prizes.

1515
01:56:51,479 --> 01:56:54,060
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, we are going to open up the Skype line.

1516
01:56:54,340 --> 01:56:59,443
[SPEAKER_08]: However, we need one contestant on the Skype line and one contestant actually in the chat room.

1517
01:56:59,523 --> 01:56:59,723
[SPEAKER_08]: So...

1518
01:57:00,956 --> 01:57:03,017
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody send a message to Sky.

1519
01:57:03,058 --> 01:57:08,521
[SPEAKER_08]: If you want to participate in tonight's match game and you're in the chat room, send a message to Sky that says match game.

1520
01:57:08,801 --> 01:57:12,404
[SPEAKER_08]: And we will pick one person at random to play the match game tonight.

1521
01:57:12,444 --> 01:57:16,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie will pick a number and we will have our contestant from the chat room.

1522
01:57:17,692 --> 01:57:20,314
[SPEAKER_08]: 3 minutes during the break here It's between 1 and 666

1523
01:57:42,623 --> 01:57:49,008
[SPEAKER_08]: In this break, let's do some DDR songs, because we haven't done some DDR.

1524
01:57:49,028 --> 01:57:50,709
[SPEAKER_08]: So let's just do a mix here.

1525
01:57:52,490 --> 01:57:54,652
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's do Volume 4.

1526
01:57:54,772 --> 01:57:57,033
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start off with some Volume 4.

1527
01:57:58,975 --> 01:58:01,697
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1528
02:00:24,578 --> 02:00:25,324
Thanks for watching!

1529
02:01:17,861 --> 02:01:18,824
Thanks for watching!

02:03:40,751 --> 02:03:41,376
DarkSakura

[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1532
02:04:44,438 --> 02:04:53,344
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got some exposed visibility lately thanks to our listeners getting us nominated for Broadcaster of the Year over on Live 365.

1533
02:04:53,404 --> 02:04:55,545
[SPEAKER_08]: So hello to any folks listening for the first time.

1534
02:04:55,886 --> 02:05:01,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Hope you enjoy Orange Lounge Radio, our little nerd fest that we have here every Sunday night.

1535
02:05:01,309 --> 02:05:04,211
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, our station does run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

1536
02:05:04,878 --> 02:05:07,120
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, describe Pump Up the Volume in one word.

1537
02:05:35,885 --> 02:05:36,385
[SPEAKER_02]: Random.

1538
02:05:36,645 --> 02:05:37,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, sounds good.

1539
02:05:37,806 --> 02:05:43,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Thursday nights, we will be back this week with Outside the Box, 7 o'clock Pacific Standard Time, all your favorite gaming news.

1540
02:05:43,749 --> 02:05:46,671
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget, we also have a podcast completely separate.

1541
02:05:46,711 --> 02:05:47,551
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not this show.

1542
02:05:47,631 --> 02:05:53,134
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a completely separate show we do about 25, 30 minutes in length that just talks about video games.

1543
02:05:53,514 --> 02:05:55,835
[SPEAKER_08]: Check that out over on our website, orangelaundry.com.

1544
02:05:55,855 --> 02:05:57,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Check out the to-go edition.

1545
02:05:57,560 --> 02:06:00,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, first off, let's see who won tonight's cage match.

1546
02:06:01,821 --> 02:06:05,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Somewhat of a closer cage match, certainly closer cage match tonight than it was last week.

1547
02:06:07,162 --> 02:06:19,124
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the end, there was one winner, and the winner of tonight's cage match is... Yoko Kanno, once again, with Rise.

1548
02:06:19,184 --> 02:06:20,784
[SPEAKER_08]: Another week off.

1549
02:06:21,044 --> 02:06:21,804
[SPEAKER_08]: Another week.

1550
02:06:22,705 --> 02:06:23,665
[SPEAKER_13]: I love you, chat room.

1551
02:06:23,685 --> 02:06:23,945
[SPEAKER_13]: Alright.

1552
02:06:24,105 --> 02:06:24,485
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1553
02:06:25,533 --> 02:06:27,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we're going to be doing the match game here.

1554
02:06:27,936 --> 02:06:34,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Two contestants battling to the death, or something like that, for these CDs we have.

1555
02:06:35,003 --> 02:06:38,487
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we need one person from the chat room and one person on the Skype line.

1556
02:06:38,527 --> 02:06:41,190
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can start hammering the Skype line now.

1557
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:44,211
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to pick one call at random on the Skype line.

1558
02:06:44,311 --> 02:06:48,873
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't go away because we will be picking up just a random call.

1559
02:06:49,033 --> 02:06:52,494
[SPEAKER_08]: So let it ring and tell you here that we picked up someone else's call.

1560
02:06:52,514 --> 02:06:53,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Then stop calling.

1561
02:06:53,574 --> 02:06:56,275
[SPEAKER_08]: In the meantime, we've got to find out who's playing from the chat room.

1562
02:06:57,015 --> 02:06:59,036
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, who is playing from chat?

1563
02:07:00,056 --> 02:07:01,797
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to pick a number between 1 and 10.

1564
02:07:03,238 --> 02:07:04,658
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to pick a number between 1 and 500.

1565
02:07:06,879 --> 02:07:09,960
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as that number happens to also be between 1 and 10, that's fine.

1566
02:07:13,851 --> 02:07:14,411
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, fine.

1567
02:07:14,451 --> 02:07:15,352
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick a number between 1 and 500.

1568
02:07:15,472 --> 02:07:16,472
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 1 and 500.

1569
02:07:16,692 --> 02:07:18,593
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoever gets closest wins.

1570
02:07:18,853 --> 02:07:19,053
[SPEAKER_08]: No, no.

1571
02:07:19,293 --> 02:07:21,754
[SPEAKER_08]: Just pick a number between 1 and 10 so I can count which person's getting it.

1572
02:07:21,774 --> 02:07:21,754
7.

1573
02:07:25,556 --> 02:07:26,016
[SPEAKER_08]: You can tell.

1574
02:07:26,116 --> 02:07:26,456
[SPEAKER_08]: It's fine.

1575
02:07:26,776 --> 02:07:27,016
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1576
02:07:27,376 --> 02:07:30,578
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie says this person gets it.

1577
02:07:31,218 --> 02:07:36,840
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have in our chat room tonight... Oh, this should be fun.

1578
02:07:37,240 --> 02:07:40,982
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku is our chat person that's going to be participating tonight.

1579
02:07:41,002 --> 02:07:41,062
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh.

1580
02:07:44,921 --> 02:07:49,645
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, so now let's go over to the Skype line and pick up a random call.

1581
02:07:49,685 --> 02:07:50,846
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got all these people calling in.

1582
02:07:50,866 --> 02:07:52,007
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's pick up this one.

1583
02:07:52,728 --> 02:07:53,809
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1584
02:07:54,890 --> 02:07:55,110
[SPEAKER_10]: Me?

1585
02:07:55,430 --> 02:07:55,550
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh.

1586
02:07:55,990 --> 02:07:56,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1587
02:07:57,272 --> 02:07:57,812
[SPEAKER_08]: Who is this?

1588
02:07:58,593 --> 02:07:59,734
[SPEAKER_10]: This is LemonLimeJump.

1589
02:07:59,874 --> 02:08:01,335
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, LemonLimeJump.

1590
02:08:01,695 --> 02:08:02,196
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1591
02:08:03,377 --> 02:08:03,677
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi.

1592
02:08:04,097 --> 02:08:06,459
[SPEAKER_08]: You are our other contestant for the match game tonight.

1593
02:08:06,499 --> 02:08:07,220
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't you excited?

1594
02:08:07,901 --> 02:08:09,442
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, especially since I'm a noob.

1595
02:08:10,331 --> 02:08:11,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Noob.

1596
02:08:11,272 --> 02:08:12,694
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, Noob.

1597
02:08:12,734 --> 02:08:13,815
[SPEAKER_02]: First call to the station.

1598
02:08:13,835 --> 02:08:14,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats.

1599
02:08:14,436 --> 02:08:14,776
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1600
02:08:15,317 --> 02:08:15,698
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1601
02:08:16,158 --> 02:08:17,940
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so you're going to be playing match game tonight.

1602
02:08:17,981 --> 02:08:19,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, do you know how match game works?

1603
02:08:20,894 --> 02:08:23,576
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you have to finish a sentence with a word or a phrase.

1604
02:08:23,616 --> 02:08:24,997
[SPEAKER_08]: You're already a pro at this.

1605
02:08:25,017 --> 02:08:26,918
[SPEAKER_08]: You're not much of a noob, because you already know what's going on.

1606
02:08:26,978 --> 02:08:36,225
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, we're going to read a sentence, and it's going to have a blank in it, and it's your job to best answer what you think the rest of us are going to put in that blank.

1607
02:08:36,305 --> 02:08:41,468
[SPEAKER_08]: So, without further ado, let's get some music here for Match Game.

1608
02:08:41,488 --> 02:08:44,110
[SPEAKER_08]: We definitely need some background music if we're going to be playing Match Game.

1609
02:08:45,751 --> 02:08:49,254
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, we don't have the rights to use the actual Match Game theme.

1610
02:08:50,151 --> 02:08:52,992
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is one celebrity you're going to try to match tonight.

1611
02:09:19,631 --> 02:09:21,972
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan the Man is another celebrity you're going to try to match tonight.

1612
02:09:22,012 --> 02:09:25,815
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Angel, Loki, and myself.

1613
02:09:25,935 --> 02:09:26,595
[SPEAKER_08]: Five people.

1614
02:09:27,916 --> 02:09:28,236
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1615
02:09:29,277 --> 02:09:30,217
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, now let me let him jump.

1616
02:09:30,277 --> 02:09:32,419
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to read the question, and you just think about it.

1617
02:09:32,459 --> 02:09:36,261
[SPEAKER_08]: You think about it for a minute, and then we'll let you know when we're ready for your answer.

1618
02:09:36,421 --> 02:09:36,721
[SPEAKER_08]: All right?

1619
02:09:37,562 --> 02:09:37,722
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

1620
02:09:37,822 --> 02:09:38,462
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here we go.

1621
02:09:38,562 --> 02:09:39,883
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number one.

1622
02:09:41,787 --> 02:09:43,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very sad.

1623
02:09:43,828 --> 02:09:44,568
[SPEAKER_08]: That's me, I'm Rob.

1624
02:09:45,028 --> 02:09:53,271
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very sad that he was unable to attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.

1625
02:09:54,051 --> 02:09:58,753
[SPEAKER_08]: However, he had more important things to do, such as stay home and blank.

1626
02:10:02,294 --> 02:10:05,996
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very sad he couldn't attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.

1627
02:10:06,056 --> 02:10:09,337
[SPEAKER_08]: However, he had more important things to do, such as stay home and blank.

1628
02:10:13,843 --> 02:10:15,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody in the room is thinking about that one.

1629
02:10:23,885 --> 02:10:25,926
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrities, please ding when you have an answer.

1630
02:10:29,127 --> 02:10:29,487
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1631
02:10:29,847 --> 02:10:30,607
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, you dinged?

1632
02:10:31,827 --> 02:10:32,688
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1633
02:10:34,748 --> 02:10:36,629
[SPEAKER_07]: Daddy says he loves me with his belt.

1634
02:10:43,843 --> 02:10:44,163
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1635
02:10:54,045 --> 02:10:59,506
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just waiting on our chatroom contestant, but that was my fault because I was a little late in pasting the question to him because it might be a little far behind there.

1636
02:11:01,867 --> 02:11:02,547
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard a ding.

1637
02:11:03,387 --> 02:11:03,827
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1638
02:11:05,688 --> 02:11:07,228
[SPEAKER_08]: I think everybody's in.

1639
02:11:07,268 --> 02:11:08,048
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, here we go.

1640
02:11:09,148 --> 02:11:11,589
[SPEAKER_08]: LemonLimeJump, you start us off, my friend.

1641
02:11:13,354 --> 02:11:18,659
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob was very sad that he was unable to attend the March Madness DDR Tournament this past Saturday.

1642
02:11:18,719 --> 02:11:26,507
[SPEAKER_10]: However, he had more important things to do, such as stay at home and... Pick that Kelly Clarkson song for the cage match.

1643
02:11:26,808 --> 02:11:30,251
[SPEAKER_08]: Pick the Kelly Clarkson song for tonight's cage match.

1644
02:11:30,451 --> 02:11:33,074
[SPEAKER_08]: That was actually something I did do yesterday, so that's something...

1645
02:11:33,712 --> 02:11:35,292
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see what Legend of Zaku says.

1646
02:11:35,673 --> 02:11:44,215
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku said he had to stay home and play 9th style while on Vicodin and forcing a ferret to play Lion Ski 7 key.

1647
02:11:45,936 --> 02:11:47,676
[SPEAKER_08]: Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.

1648
02:11:48,816 --> 02:11:49,957
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if it's a match.

1649
02:11:50,817 --> 02:11:51,557
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1650
02:11:52,337 --> 02:11:56,559
[SPEAKER_02]: Rob had to stay home and... Build a cake for DarkSakura, Pedro style.

1651
02:11:56,979 --> 02:11:59,019
[SPEAKER_08]: Build a cake for DarkSakura.

1652
02:11:59,519 --> 02:12:01,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry, that's not a match, either one.

1653
02:12:01,300 --> 02:12:01,640
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan...

1654
02:12:02,253 --> 02:12:07,334
[SPEAKER_08]: Rob had to stay home and... Download Prawn.

1655
02:12:07,455 --> 02:12:09,235
[SPEAKER_08]: Download Prawn!

1656
02:12:10,215 --> 02:12:10,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent answer.

1657
02:12:10,896 --> 02:12:11,836
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the other answer?

1658
02:12:11,856 --> 02:12:12,696
[SPEAKER_07]: The other one.

1659
02:12:13,336 --> 02:12:17,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Play Nine Style, and then LemonLimeJump said that he had to pick the Kelly Clarkson song.

1660
02:12:17,477 --> 02:12:18,598
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

1661
02:12:18,618 --> 02:12:20,698
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, I had a mental lapse there for a second.

1662
02:12:20,858 --> 02:12:21,619
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, sorry, Loki.

1663
02:12:21,759 --> 02:12:22,559
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry that happened to you.

1664
02:12:23,119 --> 02:12:27,240
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, Rob had to stay home and... Watch America's Next Top Model.

1665
02:12:27,280 --> 02:12:29,481
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, watch America's Next Top Model!

1666
02:12:30,310 --> 02:12:31,090
[SPEAKER_07]: Not a match, though.

1667
02:12:31,730 --> 02:12:36,252
[SPEAKER_07]: That was Team Loki and Loki's fiance, Nelly.

1668
02:12:36,432 --> 02:12:36,832
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, okay.

1669
02:12:36,892 --> 02:12:37,572
[SPEAKER_07]: Had to get that out there.

1670
02:12:37,852 --> 02:12:38,612
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Angel.

1671
02:12:39,412 --> 02:12:42,653
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob had to stay at home and... Watch reruns of Robot Chicken.

1672
02:12:43,254 --> 02:12:45,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Watch reruns of Robot Chicken.

1673
02:12:45,534 --> 02:12:45,994
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match.

1674
02:12:46,614 --> 02:12:50,375
[SPEAKER_08]: My answer, Rob had to stay home and look sexy.

1675
02:12:51,436 --> 02:12:52,876
[SPEAKER_08]: Because, you know, that's what I do.

1676
02:12:55,337 --> 02:12:55,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Shut up!

1677
02:12:56,877 --> 02:12:57,197
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1678
02:12:57,317 --> 02:12:59,518
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I had to practice my model walk.

1679
02:13:01,147 --> 02:13:02,968
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyway, let's get to question number two.

1680
02:13:03,649 --> 02:13:05,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So, LemonLimeJump, you didn't get it on that one.

1681
02:13:06,010 --> 02:13:06,511
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1682
02:13:07,211 --> 02:13:08,192
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have a chance.

1683
02:13:08,212 --> 02:13:09,473
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to redeem yourself on this one?

1684
02:13:10,773 --> 02:13:11,394
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I hope so.

1685
02:13:11,454 --> 02:13:14,036
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Zaku sucked on that last one too, so don't worry about it.

1686
02:13:14,116 --> 02:13:15,837
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here we go.

1687
02:13:16,157 --> 02:13:17,578
[SPEAKER_08]: At least hers made sense.

1688
02:13:18,178 --> 02:13:19,979
[SPEAKER_08]: Here is question number two.

1689
02:13:22,921 --> 02:13:25,223
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is very excited...

1690
02:13:26,005 --> 02:13:27,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Also known as DarkSakura.

1691
02:13:27,086 --> 02:13:34,314
[SPEAKER_08]: Jamie is very excited to be attending the upcoming Best of Live 365 ceremony in San Francisco.

1692
02:13:35,495 --> 02:13:41,061
[SPEAKER_08]: However, she will not be attending if they do not have any blank at the ceremony.

1693
02:13:43,964 --> 02:13:44,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1694
02:13:45,697 --> 02:13:50,139
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura is very excited to be attending the upcoming Best of Live 365 ceremony.

1695
02:13:50,159 --> 02:13:54,581
[SPEAKER_08]: However, she won't be attending if they don't have any blank at the ceremony.

1696
02:13:55,101 --> 02:13:56,101
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about that one for a minute.

1697
02:13:56,161 --> 02:13:59,263
[SPEAKER_08]: Guests, or sorry, celebrities, please let me know when you have dinged.

1698
02:14:02,984 --> 02:14:03,344
[SPEAKER_08]: Ding.

1699
02:14:08,786 --> 02:14:09,207
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1700
02:14:10,107 --> 02:14:10,787
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel's thinking.

1701
02:14:10,847 --> 02:14:12,168
[SPEAKER_08]: I see her with a pen to the paper.

1702
02:14:12,588 --> 02:14:13,448
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't lose hope, Angel.

1703
02:14:13,468 --> 02:14:14,829
[SPEAKER_08]: Just write the first thing that comes to mind.

1704
02:14:15,453 --> 02:14:21,216
[SPEAKER_08]: She won't be attending if they don't have any... And you know that there's other live 365 broadcasters out there that are listening right now.

1705
02:14:21,717 --> 02:14:24,538
[SPEAKER_08]: So, this might be important for them to know.

1706
02:14:24,638 --> 02:14:27,160
[SPEAKER_08]: That Jamie is not coming unless Blank is there.

1707
02:14:28,200 --> 02:14:28,700
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll see.

1708
02:14:29,801 --> 02:14:30,621
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Angel, you got it?

1709
02:14:31,262 --> 02:14:31,882
[SPEAKER_08]: I see her writing.

1710
02:14:31,902 --> 02:14:32,242
[SPEAKER_08]: Good enough.

1711
02:14:32,302 --> 02:14:32,643
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay!

1712
02:14:33,283 --> 02:14:34,784
[SPEAKER_08]: LemonLimeJump, you're up first.

1713
02:14:35,384 --> 02:14:38,826
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be attending if they do not have any... Cheese.

1714
02:14:39,306 --> 02:14:40,887
[SPEAKER_08]: Any cheese!

1715
02:14:42,028 --> 02:14:42,668
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's see.

1716
02:14:42,688 --> 02:14:42,768
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku!

1717
02:14:45,416 --> 02:14:47,317
[SPEAKER_08]: says, Jamie is very excited to be attending.

1718
02:14:47,377 --> 02:14:54,061
[SPEAKER_08]: However, she will not be attending the Best of Life 365 ceremony if they do not have any Jesus juice at the ceremony.

1719
02:14:54,721 --> 02:14:55,622
[SPEAKER_08]: Jesus juice.

1720
02:14:56,502 --> 02:14:57,083
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match.

1721
02:14:57,363 --> 02:14:57,823
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1722
02:14:58,523 --> 02:15:00,685
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, Michael Jackson, the wine and the Diet Coke.

1723
02:15:00,725 --> 02:15:00,965
[SPEAKER_08]: Get it?

1724
02:15:01,225 --> 02:15:01,525
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1725
02:15:02,085 --> 02:15:02,566
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1726
02:15:04,467 --> 02:15:06,608
[SPEAKER_08]: It could be a match with one of our celebrities, though.

1727
02:15:06,628 --> 02:15:07,208
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's find out.

1728
02:15:07,288 --> 02:15:07,969
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura.

1729
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:12,251
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be attending if they do not have any booze.

1730
02:15:12,551 --> 02:15:12,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Booze!

1731
02:15:12,912 --> 02:15:13,252
[SPEAKER_08]: Booze!

1732
02:15:14,406 --> 02:15:14,866
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match.

1733
02:15:15,207 --> 02:15:17,548
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, that's not a good enough match with Jesus Juice.

1734
02:15:17,608 --> 02:15:18,628
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't allow that one.

1735
02:15:19,129 --> 02:15:19,549
[SPEAKER_08]: DanTheMan.

1736
02:15:19,569 --> 02:15:20,550
[SPEAKER_08]: Do we have a mic for DanTheMan?

1737
02:15:21,130 --> 02:15:21,610
[SPEAKER_08]: DanTheMan.

1738
02:15:22,711 --> 02:15:25,372
[SPEAKER_08]: Will not be attending if they do not have any... Pie.

1739
02:15:25,492 --> 02:15:26,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Pie!

1740
02:15:26,473 --> 02:15:27,554
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent answer.

1741
02:15:27,654 --> 02:15:28,054
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match.

1742
02:15:28,134 --> 02:15:28,394
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

1743
02:15:28,714 --> 02:15:29,094
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

1744
02:15:30,015 --> 02:15:33,477
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be attending if they do not have any... Pie.

1745
02:15:33,677 --> 02:15:34,398
[SPEAKER_08]: Pie!

1746
02:15:34,818 --> 02:15:35,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Another one for Pie.

1747
02:15:35,758 --> 02:15:36,579
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been a good one to pick.

1748
02:15:36,739 --> 02:15:37,039
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel.

1749
02:15:37,339 --> 02:15:39,901
[SPEAKER_08]: She will not be attending if they do not have any... Guinness.

1750
02:15:40,701 --> 02:15:41,161
[SPEAKER_08]: Guinness!

1751
02:15:42,623 --> 02:15:46,445
[SPEAKER_08]: and I said she will not be attending if they do not have any Guinness.

1752
02:15:46,645 --> 02:15:49,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I also put Guinness, so... That was actually the first thing I put.

1753
02:15:49,927 --> 02:15:53,789
[SPEAKER_08]: Guinness and pie were the two, but unfortunately not a match.

1754
02:15:53,929 --> 02:15:55,270
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, LemonLimeJump.

1755
02:15:55,570 --> 02:15:56,150
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

1756
02:15:56,351 --> 02:15:57,131
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Zaku.

1757
02:15:57,811 --> 02:16:00,233
[SPEAKER_08]: You have one more chance, though, LemonLimeJump.

1758
02:16:00,533 --> 02:16:01,053
[SPEAKER_08]: One more chance.

1759
02:16:01,073 --> 02:16:01,373
[SPEAKER_08]: You ready?

1760
02:16:02,074 --> 02:16:02,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1761
02:16:02,494 --> 02:16:03,114
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, here it is.

1762
02:16:03,594 --> 02:16:04,455
[SPEAKER_08]: The last question.

1763
02:16:04,495 --> 02:16:05,255
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number three.

1764
02:16:08,237 --> 02:16:08,857
[SPEAKER_08]: Question number three.

1765
02:16:09,197 --> 02:16:11,799
[SPEAKER_08]: As you heard earlier this evening...

1766
02:16:13,007 --> 02:16:17,069
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki is building a charger for the DS out of Legos.

1767
02:16:17,870 --> 02:16:19,871
[SPEAKER_08]: He borrowed this idea from another website.

1768
02:16:20,691 --> 02:16:27,935
[SPEAKER_08]: However, soon, Loki will be writing another Lego building FAQ for OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1769
02:16:28,636 --> 02:16:33,058
[SPEAKER_08]: It's called, How to Build a Blank for Your PSP.

1770
02:16:35,960 --> 02:16:36,680
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of Legos.

1771
02:16:37,200 --> 02:16:38,781
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll be doing another Lego FAQ.

1772
02:16:39,401 --> 02:16:41,963
[SPEAKER_08]: How to Build a Blank for Your PSP.

1773
02:16:43,356 --> 02:16:44,297
[SPEAKER_08]: Think about that one for a minute.

1774
02:16:44,357 --> 02:16:45,759
[SPEAKER_08]: Celebrities, let me know when you've dinged.

1775
02:16:45,779 --> 02:16:48,322
[SPEAKER_08]: A ding, I guess.

1776
02:16:58,774 --> 02:16:59,715
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm hearing some dings.

1777
02:17:01,710 --> 02:17:03,571
[SPEAKER_08]: You are listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1778
02:17:03,591 --> 02:17:04,832
[SPEAKER_08]: We're in the middle of match game.

1779
02:17:05,152 --> 02:17:08,253
[SPEAKER_08]: Lemon Lime Jump versus Legend of Zaku on the line.

1780
02:17:08,854 --> 02:17:12,796
[SPEAKER_08]: Two sampler CDs, one for Resident Evil 4 and NBA 2005.

1781
02:17:12,876 --> 02:17:13,896
[SPEAKER_08]: It's all tied up.

1782
02:17:13,936 --> 02:17:14,857
[SPEAKER_08]: It's nothing right now.

1783
02:17:15,397 --> 02:17:15,977
[SPEAKER_08]: We will see.

1784
02:17:17,518 --> 02:17:17,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1785
02:17:20,099 --> 02:17:21,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, is everybody dinged?

1786
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:22,080
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you dinged?

1787
02:17:22,320 --> 02:17:22,981
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Angel's still there.

1788
02:17:23,001 --> 02:17:25,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, you want to see some chat room suggestions here, Angel?

1789
02:17:26,162 --> 02:17:26,402
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

1790
02:17:30,404 --> 02:17:31,065
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course, you guys...

1791
02:17:34,619 --> 02:17:35,360
[SPEAKER_08]: Battery Charger

1792
02:18:00,253 --> 02:18:02,454
[SPEAKER_08]: Battery Charger for your PSP.

1793
02:18:02,494 --> 02:18:03,914
[SPEAKER_08]: A nice, logical answer.

1794
02:18:03,954 --> 02:18:04,974
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see if it pays off.

1795
02:18:05,415 --> 02:18:11,456
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku says, how to build a ghetto-rigged iPod 40 gigabytes.

1796
02:18:12,737 --> 02:18:13,237
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see.

1797
02:18:13,657 --> 02:18:15,338
[SPEAKER_08]: For your PSP, we will find out.

1798
02:18:15,998 --> 02:18:18,419
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, how to build a... Catapult.

1799
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:19,539
[SPEAKER_08]: Catapult!

1800
02:18:20,219 --> 02:18:21,260
[SPEAKER_08]: Is not a match, I'm sorry.

1801
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:25,521
[SPEAKER_08]: DanTheMan, Loki will be showing how to build a...

1802
02:18:26,476 --> 02:18:27,817
[SPEAKER_08]: Stand of displayness.

1803
02:18:28,117 --> 02:18:31,498
[SPEAKER_08]: Stand of displayness out of LEGOs for the PSP.

1804
02:18:31,959 --> 02:18:32,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Not a match, unfortunately.

1805
02:18:33,079 --> 02:18:33,479
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki.

1806
02:18:34,600 --> 02:18:40,002
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess I'll be designing a Portal to Hell device.

1807
02:18:40,102 --> 02:18:40,483
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

1808
02:18:40,583 --> 02:18:42,183
[SPEAKER_08]: A Portal to Hell for your PSP.

1809
02:18:42,203 --> 02:18:43,764
[SPEAKER_08]: A device to talk to the dead.

1810
02:18:44,004 --> 02:18:44,484
[SPEAKER_08]: Out of LEGOs.

1811
02:18:44,584 --> 02:18:45,465
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Portal to Hell.

1812
02:18:45,785 --> 02:18:46,425
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not a match.

1813
02:18:46,906 --> 02:18:47,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Angel.

1814
02:18:48,026 --> 02:18:51,968
[SPEAKER_08]: He'll show you how to build a... Ghetto game dispenser.

1815
02:18:52,328 --> 02:18:52,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't ask.

1816
02:18:53,008 --> 02:18:54,069
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not original tonight.

1817
02:18:54,844 --> 02:18:56,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Ghetto Game Dispenser.

1818
02:18:56,165 --> 02:18:57,346
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he has something to hold your games.

1819
02:18:57,846 --> 02:19:03,569
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said that he will be showing how to build a feeding tube for your PSP.

1820
02:19:04,370 --> 02:19:05,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, not a match.

1821
02:19:07,712 --> 02:19:16,998
[SPEAKER_08]: So, it's all tied up at 0-0, which means, unfortunately, LemonLimeJump and Zaku have both lost tonight.

1822
02:19:18,679 --> 02:19:18,899
[SPEAKER_08]: Aww.

1823
02:19:19,399 --> 02:19:21,921
[SPEAKER_08]: But that's okay, because that means they get to split the loot!

1824
02:19:21,941 --> 02:19:22,001
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes!

1825
02:19:22,677 --> 02:19:24,799
[SPEAKER_08]: Yay, so Lemon Lime Jump, you still win.

1826
02:19:24,999 --> 02:19:25,620
[SPEAKER_08]: Aren't you happy?

1827
02:19:26,341 --> 02:19:26,861
[SPEAKER_20]: Wow.

1828
02:19:27,001 --> 02:19:29,744
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, since I have you on the line, that was a genuine excitement.

1829
02:19:29,984 --> 02:19:30,304
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1830
02:19:31,125 --> 02:19:32,186
[SPEAKER_08]: Lemon Lime Jump, what do you want?

1831
02:19:32,206 --> 02:19:37,751
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you want the Resident Evil 4 CD, or do you want the NBA 2005 CD?

1832
02:19:39,773 --> 02:19:41,775
[SPEAKER_10]: Resident Evil, because I was... wait.

1833
02:19:43,717 --> 02:19:44,558
[SPEAKER_08]: Decisions, decisions.

1834
02:19:46,520 --> 02:19:46,780
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1835
02:19:46,800 --> 02:19:46,880
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

1836
02:19:47,563 --> 02:19:48,824
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, Resident Evil.

1837
02:19:48,844 --> 02:19:50,326
[SPEAKER_08]: She's taking the Resident Evil 4 soundtrack.

1838
02:19:50,766 --> 02:19:52,468
[SPEAKER_08]: Zaku, you don't go home a loser.

1839
02:19:52,488 --> 02:19:54,670
[SPEAKER_08]: You get the NBA 2005 soundtrack.

1840
02:19:54,690 --> 02:19:55,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much for playing.

1841
02:19:56,071 --> 02:19:56,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me line jump.

1842
02:19:56,572 --> 02:19:57,713
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll be in touch and chat, alright?

1843
02:19:58,794 --> 02:19:59,194
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, thanks.

1844
02:19:59,214 --> 02:19:59,574
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.

1845
02:19:59,614 --> 02:20:00,375
[SPEAKER_08]: I need to get your address.

1846
02:20:00,395 --> 02:20:00,916
[SPEAKER_08]: Have a good one.

1847
02:20:00,936 --> 02:20:01,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for playing.

1848
02:20:03,378 --> 02:20:03,778
[SPEAKER_08]: Later.

1849
02:20:04,219 --> 02:20:04,719
[SPEAKER_08]: You're welcome.

1850
02:20:04,759 --> 02:20:05,200
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

1851
02:20:08,343 --> 02:20:10,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked her wow was the best part of that whole segment.

1852
02:20:10,705 --> 02:20:11,085
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.

1853
02:20:12,567 --> 02:20:12,867
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

1854
02:20:17,327 --> 02:20:24,809
[SPEAKER_07]: I was hoping that it was a woman, because I called her a her, and if it was a guy, that would have been really bad.

1855
02:20:24,829 --> 02:20:29,249
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you saying she sounds like a man?

1856
02:20:29,269 --> 02:20:31,390
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm saying that some guys, some kids sound like women.

1857
02:20:31,490 --> 02:20:36,231
[SPEAKER_08]: Most of our listeners are males, so it's nice to have some more females listening to the program.

1858
02:20:36,811 --> 02:20:39,071
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to a break.

1859
02:20:39,091 --> 02:20:42,252
[SPEAKER_08]: When we come back from break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

1860
02:20:43,192 --> 02:20:44,453
[SPEAKER_08]: Dig through those Legos, Loki.

1861
02:20:46,153 --> 02:20:46,493
[SPEAKER_08]: I will.

1862
02:20:47,679 --> 02:20:49,401
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, we'll be back after this.

1863
02:20:49,421 --> 02:20:50,402
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to start it off.

1864
02:20:50,622 --> 02:20:52,163
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do just a mix of music here.

1865
02:20:52,504 --> 02:20:56,087
[SPEAKER_08]: Start it off with some AM3P from Old School DDR.

1866
02:20:56,107 --> 02:20:59,790
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and the FUs of the Week and more.

1867
02:21:00,071 --> 02:21:00,491
[SPEAKER_08]: Stay tuned.

1868
02:21:06,156 --> 02:21:07,638

Thanks for watching!

1873
02:23:03,141 --> 02:23:05,342
I tried to turn down the record

1874
02:23:17,902 --> 02:23:19,223
[SPEAKER_19]: Thanks for watching!

1875
02:23:40,097 --> 02:23:40,798
Thanks for watching!

1876
02:23:54,848 --> 02:23:55,828
Thanks for watching!

1877
02:26:11,085 --> 02:26:11,846
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

1880
02:28:01,698 --> 02:28:05,765
[SPEAKER_19]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this D.R.

1881
02:28:05,825 --> 02:28:06,526
[SPEAKER_19]: sucks!

1882
02:28:06,606 --> 02:28:12,475
[SPEAKER_19]: Holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler, holler!

1883
02:28:15,356 --> 02:28:22,064
[SPEAKER_08]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 137 on this Easter Sunday, March 27, 2005.

1884
02:28:22,805 --> 02:28:25,208
[SPEAKER_08]: On what has been quite an interesting show tonight.

1885
02:28:25,268 --> 02:28:26,769
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting vibe going on tonight.

1886
02:28:26,789 --> 02:28:29,132
[SPEAKER_08]: We had some good calls on the Skype line a little earlier tonight.

1887
02:28:29,893 --> 02:28:33,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually getting out the DDR mat and playing Ultramix live on air.

1888
02:28:33,257 --> 02:28:34,438
[SPEAKER_20]: First CD I've played in a month.

1889
02:28:34,658 --> 02:28:35,539
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always looking.

1890
02:28:35,579 --> 02:28:36,240
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm always looking.

1891
02:29:00,794 --> 02:29:07,156
[SPEAKER_08]: Which is weird because I was hearing these stories about, oh my gosh, PSPs are sold out everywhere and you can't get one no matter what.

1892
02:29:07,956 --> 02:29:09,296
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, mic down.

1893
02:29:09,376 --> 02:29:09,836
[SPEAKER_08]: Get down a mic.

1894
02:29:10,437 --> 02:29:11,097
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, Lego boy.

1895
02:29:11,617 --> 02:29:12,077
[SPEAKER_08]: Get down a mic.

1896
02:29:15,118 --> 02:29:24,780
[SPEAKER_00]: The only reason we would have any left is because some weren't picked up by the fools who laid down $50 and just decided they didn't want them.

1897
02:29:25,200 --> 02:29:25,720
[SPEAKER_08]: $50 reserve.

1898
02:29:25,740 --> 02:29:25,980
[SPEAKER_00]: $50 deposit.

1899
02:29:26,000 --> 02:29:26,060
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

1900
02:29:29,079 --> 02:29:30,280
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

1901
02:29:49,125 --> 02:29:52,407
[SPEAKER_08]: And do these people get their $50 back or no?

1902
02:29:52,787 --> 02:30:00,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a GameStop reservation is totally refundable, unlike an EB reservation that they make you spend in the store because EB sucks.

1903
02:30:03,353 --> 02:30:05,914
[SPEAKER_08]: Now we have some EB employees that listen to this show, so be nice.

1904
02:30:05,934 --> 02:30:06,534
[SPEAKER_08]: They can suck it.

1905
02:30:06,635 --> 02:30:08,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Be nice, be nice.

1906
02:30:09,276 --> 02:30:10,557
[SPEAKER_08]: Can't we all just get along?

1907
02:30:10,597 --> 02:30:11,677
[SPEAKER_08]: They're babies, you know.

1908
02:30:12,037 --> 02:30:13,218
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what EB stands for.

1909
02:30:16,340 --> 02:30:18,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't there enough hate in this world?

1910
02:30:18,422 --> 02:30:18,802
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

1911
02:30:18,862 --> 02:30:20,844
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to spread love here on Orange Lounge.

1912
02:30:21,124 --> 02:30:23,126
[SPEAKER_08]: GameStop and EB should come together in harmony.

1913
02:30:23,346 --> 02:30:24,847
[SPEAKER_08]: And then Best Buy could join in.

1914
02:30:25,327 --> 02:30:26,148
[SPEAKER_08]: But not Walmart.

1915
02:30:26,408 --> 02:30:26,949
[SPEAKER_08]: Not Walmart.

1916
02:30:26,969 --> 02:30:27,549
[SPEAKER_08]: Walmart's evil.

1917
02:30:28,850 --> 02:30:29,531
[SPEAKER_08]: Screw EB.

1918
02:30:30,572 --> 02:30:31,492
[SPEAKER_00]: Screw GameCrazy.

1919
02:30:33,612 --> 02:30:36,873
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't screw the people who work there because they suffer just like I do.

1920
02:30:53,599 --> 02:30:57,120
[SPEAKER_00]: You obviously didn't come to my store where we've had assloads of them forever.

1921
02:30:57,700 --> 02:30:58,140
[SPEAKER_08]: I didn't.

1922
02:30:58,620 --> 02:31:00,861
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as red octane ignition pads.

1923
02:31:01,041 --> 02:31:04,121
[SPEAKER_08]: But I ended up going to the GameStop up the street and I did pick up Ultramix 2 there.

1924
02:31:04,261 --> 02:31:06,582
[SPEAKER_08]: They just didn't have it at my usual GameStop up the street.

1925
02:31:07,322 --> 02:31:07,822
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

1926
02:31:07,982 --> 02:31:08,462
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Dan.

1927
02:31:11,743 --> 02:31:12,243
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1928
02:31:13,423 --> 02:31:14,023
[SPEAKER_08]: We do a little segment.

1929
02:31:14,043 --> 02:31:21,865
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to get into the FUs of the week here shortly, but before we get into that, we're going to get into a segment we like to do here on the show called the...

1930
02:31:22,415 --> 02:31:23,176
[SPEAKER_08]: No, not FNA.

1931
02:31:23,436 --> 02:31:26,819
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

1932
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,242
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, it's the kitties one.

1933
02:31:30,363 --> 02:31:31,964
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I don't have the kitties one, actually.

1934
02:31:31,984 --> 02:31:32,645
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the imaging form.

1935
02:31:32,685 --> 02:31:35,408
[SPEAKER_02]: It's everyone posting pictures of their cats.

1936
02:31:37,510 --> 02:31:38,691
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not the kitty post.

1937
02:31:38,711 --> 02:31:41,854
[SPEAKER_08]: Was there enough room on the desktop for that?

1938
02:31:42,134 --> 02:31:43,335
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, you need to shut up.

1939
02:31:43,495 --> 02:31:43,816
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1940
02:31:45,086 --> 02:31:48,107
[SPEAKER_08]: Those of you guys listening to Orange Launch Radio for the first time, welcome.

1941
02:31:48,167 --> 02:32:00,789
[SPEAKER_08]: And DDR Freak, for those that may not know, because I think some of our new listeners may be unfamiliar with DDR, it's the largest website out there dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution, the video game that really started us off.

1942
02:32:01,109 --> 02:32:04,590
[SPEAKER_08]: Although we're about gaming in general now, DDR is really what started us off.

1943
02:32:04,630 --> 02:32:08,690
[SPEAKER_08]: So we still show our love to DDR Freak by honoring their post of the week.

1944
02:32:08,990 --> 02:32:10,851
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know it's got a forum with, what, like 50,000 users?

1945
02:32:12,944 --> 02:32:16,265
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's always somebody interesting posting.

1946
02:32:17,806 --> 02:32:19,387
[SPEAKER_08]: By interesting, you mean stupid, right?

1947
02:32:19,967 --> 02:32:20,747
[SPEAKER_08]: I wasn't going to say that.

1948
02:32:22,408 --> 02:32:24,749
[SPEAKER_08]: I just got a call as I see it.

1949
02:32:24,829 --> 02:32:31,792
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually had a hard time finding a really stupid post this week, so I found a WTF post.

1950
02:32:32,592 --> 02:32:33,052
[SPEAKER_08]: So here it is.

1951
02:32:33,412 --> 02:32:40,775
[SPEAKER_08]: This was in the DDR console games section, and the subject is, Is anyone this desperate?

1952
02:32:41,836 --> 02:32:42,516
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's the message.

1953
02:32:43,975 --> 02:32:50,977
[SPEAKER_08]: I am now starting to create step charts on my games that aren't the right songs that go with the song.

1954
02:32:51,437 --> 02:32:55,438
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I created PS on Max 300 for DDR Max.

1955
02:32:55,958 --> 02:32:59,499
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to also make Cartoon Heroes and Across the Nightmare.

1956
02:32:59,879 --> 02:33:04,201
[SPEAKER_08]: When I do this, I have the music mute or just have claps in training mode.

1957
02:33:04,481 --> 02:33:06,861
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone else do this or am I just weird?

1958
02:33:08,342 --> 02:33:08,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Just weird.

1959
02:33:10,717 --> 02:33:17,759
[SPEAKER_08]: So if I'm understanding that post correctly, he mutes the TV.

1960
02:33:18,479 --> 02:33:20,320
[SPEAKER_08]: The whole point of DDR is to dance to the song.

1961
02:33:20,340 --> 02:33:22,260
[SPEAKER_08]: He mutes the TV and creates his own stuff.

1962
02:33:22,300 --> 02:33:25,721
[SPEAKER_07]: He has step charts for songs that aren't in the game.

1963
02:33:26,001 --> 02:33:31,803
[SPEAKER_07]: They did this a long-ass time ago when The Legend of Max was coming out and stuff like that.

1964
02:33:32,243 --> 02:33:38,405
[SPEAKER_07]: They were making Max on dropout and stuff and putting the steps on there to prepare for it and stuff.

1965
02:33:38,905 --> 02:33:39,845
[SPEAKER_07]: This has been done before.

1966
02:33:44,505 --> 02:33:47,486
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that to an edit that I made once just to listen to it.

1967
02:33:48,267 --> 02:33:51,868
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you remember my really evil one that I did to DXY?

1968
02:33:52,548 --> 02:33:53,709
[SPEAKER_02]: The another edit?

1969
02:33:54,109 --> 02:33:55,149
[SPEAKER_02]: It just sounded really cool.

1970
02:33:57,610 --> 02:34:04,293
[SPEAKER_08]: I just... People really, really badly want Cartoon Heroes and USDDR.

1971
02:34:04,333 --> 02:34:07,154
[SPEAKER_08]: They will go to great lengths to get this song in DDR.

1972
02:34:07,595 --> 02:34:08,955
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a song, guys.

1973
02:34:09,636 --> 02:34:10,536
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a song.

1974
02:34:11,554 --> 02:34:13,395
[SPEAKER_08]: If it really means that much to you, pay the money.

1975
02:34:13,455 --> 02:34:14,535
[SPEAKER_08]: Get an import PlayStation.

1976
02:34:14,575 --> 02:34:15,236
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know what to tell you.

1977
02:34:17,256 --> 02:34:17,636
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1978
02:34:19,777 --> 02:34:26,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's go to another segment we like to do here called the FUs of the Week.

1979
02:34:28,301 --> 02:34:30,302
[SPEAKER_08]: And what do we do during the FUs of the Week?

1980
02:34:30,322 --> 02:34:31,162
[SPEAKER_08]: We get ranty.

1981
02:34:31,622 --> 02:34:34,803
[SPEAKER_08]: We do this every single week for you folks that are new to Orange Lounge Radio.

1982
02:34:35,203 --> 02:34:36,304
[SPEAKER_02]: We set a bunch of people on fire.

1983
02:34:36,860 --> 02:34:37,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.

1984
02:34:37,401 --> 02:34:37,661
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

1985
02:34:38,382 --> 02:34:41,766
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's just a chance for us to kind of unload a little bit and feel better by venting.

1986
02:34:42,387 --> 02:34:45,511
[SPEAKER_08]: So, DarkSakura, why is it we have to do this every single week?

1987
02:35:03,881 --> 02:35:09,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, I don't really have too much in the way of angst tonight, being that I'm in a generally good mood.

1988
02:35:10,242 --> 02:35:11,602
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know what, Rob?

1989
02:35:13,223 --> 02:35:13,443
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

1990
02:35:14,143 --> 02:35:15,903
[SPEAKER_02]: A big F you go to your bathroom.

1991
02:35:16,983 --> 02:35:18,063
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I'm gonna say.

1992
02:35:19,824 --> 02:35:20,164
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1993
02:35:20,604 --> 02:35:22,704
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, oh yeah, an idiot's on the road.

1994
02:35:23,904 --> 02:35:24,345
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

1995
02:35:25,525 --> 02:35:26,905
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cause I'm in a generally good mood.

1996
02:35:27,165 --> 02:35:28,725
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that's amazing.

1997
02:35:29,185 --> 02:35:29,405
Yeah.

1998
02:35:29,865 --> 02:35:32,766
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, well let's move on then to Loki.

1999
02:35:35,578 --> 02:35:44,808
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, first off, I'd like to say, um, fuck him at work for taking so long to get back to me on whether or not I have this job.

2000
02:35:44,848 --> 02:35:50,455
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that you're busy, like, interviewing people because they keep stealing people out of your department, but, you know, I would like to know.

2001
02:35:50,919 --> 02:35:51,499
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for watching!

2002
02:36:08,471 --> 02:36:09,132
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm gonna live.

2003
02:36:11,353 --> 02:36:17,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Also, fuck you drivers because there are so many bad drivers out there that are not paying attention.

2004
02:36:18,396 --> 02:36:19,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though most of them seem to be women.

2005
02:36:20,337 --> 02:36:21,998
[SPEAKER_07]: And, ow!

2006
02:36:22,799 --> 02:36:27,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Nelly gives an F you to me for saying that, and she also gives an F you to me for playing with my Legos.

2007
02:36:29,883 --> 02:36:31,784
[SPEAKER_07]: And F you to the lack of pie from her.

2008
02:36:33,905 --> 02:36:34,205
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm done.

2009
02:36:42,096 --> 02:36:46,077
[SPEAKER_08]: I'd like to give an F you to the local pizza places for not being open today.

2010
02:36:46,837 --> 02:36:55,119
[SPEAKER_08]: I realize that it's Easter and it's a religious holiday and people are spending time with their families and yada yada, but I put in my time with my family this morning.

2011
02:36:55,519 --> 02:36:56,319
[SPEAKER_08]: And you know what?

2012
02:36:56,359 --> 02:36:57,799
[SPEAKER_08]: You pizza people can do that too.

2013
02:36:57,839 --> 02:37:02,680
[SPEAKER_08]: It's putting your time in the morning and then be there to make me a pizza in the evening because I'm lazy and I don't cook.

2014
02:37:03,120 --> 02:37:03,901
[SPEAKER_08]: Not even on Easter.

2015
02:37:04,181 --> 02:37:04,821
[SPEAKER_08]: So, sorry.

2016
02:37:07,390 --> 02:37:13,594
[SPEAKER_08]: Also an F you to the fact that I did not get a single piece of candy today being Easter.

2017
02:37:14,074 --> 02:37:21,779
[SPEAKER_08]: I went the whole day without a single... F you to not getting two pieces of candy today on Easter.

2018
02:37:23,279 --> 02:37:23,780
[SPEAKER_08]: I forgot.

2019
02:37:23,800 --> 02:37:25,181
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelly did give me a peanut butter cup.

2020
02:37:25,221 --> 02:37:25,621
[SPEAKER_08]: My bad.

2021
02:37:26,441 --> 02:37:30,244
[SPEAKER_08]: An F you to myself for being a forgetful jerk and making myself sound like an ass on the radio.

2022
02:37:30,304 --> 02:37:30,644
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2023
02:37:32,825 --> 02:37:33,125
[SPEAKER_08]: One more.

2024
02:37:33,145 --> 02:37:35,867
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to Rob for making me play the dancing game.

2025
02:37:36,554 --> 02:37:39,295
[SPEAKER_07]: and Get Tired, because I'm out of shape.

2026
02:37:41,475 --> 02:37:43,976
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait until the picture shows up in the paper, then you can give me an FU.

2027
02:37:45,296 --> 02:37:54,519
[SPEAKER_08]: And I would like to give an FU to... An FU to having to wait to find out if I'm going to get this new apartment or not.

2028
02:37:55,139 --> 02:37:56,199
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I don't like waiting.

2029
02:37:56,779 --> 02:37:57,379
[SPEAKER_08]: Waiting sucks.

2030
02:37:58,440 --> 02:38:01,280
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go on to other folks and their FUs.

2031
02:38:01,300 --> 02:38:03,321
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

2032
02:38:04,950 --> 02:38:16,278
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to not being able to find my expansion discs for Final Fantasy XI because, I don't know, I just want to install it all at once and then, you know, do that massive patch download and then just play.

2033
02:38:16,358 --> 02:38:23,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to, you know, have to find the discs later and install them and crap because no.

2034
02:38:24,023 --> 02:38:24,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Just no.

2035
02:38:24,983 --> 02:38:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that means more downloading patches later and I'd rather just do it all at once.

2036
02:38:30,727 --> 02:38:34,570
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to running out of spring break because I want more but,

2037
02:38:35,396 --> 02:38:37,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I have school this week, so damn it.

2038
02:38:38,657 --> 02:38:44,779
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to not play DDR more because I really lost my stamina and I really want it back, so that means I'm going to play more.

2039
02:38:46,300 --> 02:38:47,320
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2040
02:38:48,360 --> 02:38:48,921
[SPEAKER_04]: More to come later.

2041
02:38:49,001 --> 02:38:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

2042
02:38:50,621 --> 02:38:52,102
[SPEAKER_08]: Does Dan the Man have any FUs?

2043
02:38:52,982 --> 02:38:54,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's hear some FUs from Dan the Man.

2044
02:38:54,983 --> 02:38:55,923
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we get Dan the Man to mic?

2045
02:38:56,523 --> 02:38:56,783
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki.

2046
02:38:57,784 --> 02:38:58,124
[SPEAKER_08]: FUs.

2047
02:38:58,264 --> 02:38:58,424
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2048
02:38:58,444 --> 02:38:59,724
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any FUs of the week, Dan the Man?

2049
02:39:01,205 --> 02:39:01,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Not few to me.

2050
02:39:03,089 --> 02:39:04,210
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm addicted to Lumines.

2051
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:09,932
[SPEAKER_00]: An F you to Rob for making me look away from Lumines to answer this question.

2052
02:39:10,973 --> 02:39:14,394
[SPEAKER_00]: And an F you to Sony for shoddy quality control and dead pixels.

2053
02:39:15,014 --> 02:39:15,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the fucking problem!

2054
02:39:17,275 --> 02:39:17,676
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix it!

2055
02:39:20,217 --> 02:39:20,497
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.

2056
02:39:21,137 --> 02:39:21,958
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

2057
02:39:23,758 --> 02:39:24,339
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to my game.

2058
02:39:26,700 --> 02:39:29,521
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's get to chatroom FUs.

2059
02:39:31,593 --> 02:39:38,838
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku says, F you to not being able to find a Konami 2DX controller, new or used, for around $50 to $60.

2060
02:39:38,938 --> 02:39:40,239
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that's part of the problem.

2061
02:39:41,080 --> 02:39:44,782
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to Old Man Winter for making it the coldest winter ever for New York.

2062
02:39:45,002 --> 02:39:49,225
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to my ever so shitty stamina for holding me back from playing 9-footers in DDR.

2063
02:39:49,746 --> 02:39:52,908
[SPEAKER_08]: And F you to sucking horribly at playing 2DX in the arcades.

2064
02:39:54,845 --> 02:39:59,249
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Tetsuya says, a continued FU to G4 for killing off the screensavers.

2065
02:39:59,769 --> 02:40:03,513
[SPEAKER_08]: An FU to whatever corrupted my extreme US data several months of work.

2066
02:40:03,853 --> 02:40:04,193
[SPEAKER_08]: Gone.

2067
02:40:05,895 --> 02:40:10,459
[SPEAKER_08]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to my job for opening on Easter Sunday.

2068
02:40:11,340 --> 02:40:16,404
[SPEAKER_08]: Know that the rest of the mall was closed, so we were the only store in the mall open today and it was slow.

2069
02:40:18,806 --> 02:40:23,548
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ 100 Matt says, F you not being able to get into the anime convention in Arizona.

2070
02:40:23,588 --> 02:40:28,971
[SPEAKER_08]: It turns out they only let 850 people in, thus shutting out hundreds of anime fans.

2071
02:40:29,171 --> 02:40:31,032
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow, that is poor planning.

2072
02:40:31,712 --> 02:40:32,693
[SPEAKER_08]: I would have been pissed.

2073
02:40:33,873 --> 02:40:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Shame, shame.

2074
02:40:35,214 --> 02:40:37,775
[SPEAKER_07]: Real quick, I'd like to give an F you to see herpes.

2075
02:40:39,236 --> 02:40:40,376
[SPEAKER_19]: I just see herpes.

2076
02:40:44,221 --> 02:40:47,484
[SPEAKER_08]: If herpes is coming from lobsters, quit ruining the show.

2077
02:40:47,644 --> 02:40:48,645
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just kidding.

2078
02:40:48,785 --> 02:40:52,388
[SPEAKER_08]: SS2100Matt also says, F you to Golfland for closing the arcade.

2079

[SPEAKER_08]: The only day I have off.

2080
02:40:55,390 --> 02:40:58,412
[SPEAKER_08]: And for Ivan Drago killing Apollo Creed.

2081
02:40:58,793 --> 02:41:01,795
[SPEAKER_08]: Gotta love the never-ending Rocky movie marathon on AMC.

2082
02:41:06,759 --> 02:41:11,603
[SPEAKER_08]: LemonLimeJump says, F you to websites that don't show up properly in Firefox.

2083
02:41:15,039 --> 02:41:25,623
[SPEAKER_08]: BlackDevilerX says F you to the fact that I haven't been able to listen lately F you to the fact that it's Easter and I didn't get any candy at all Are you sure somebody didn't secretly give you a peanut butter cup?

2084
02:41:25,743 --> 02:41:27,684
[SPEAKER_08]: Because they'll be really ticked off if they hear that

2085
02:41:29,119 --> 02:41:37,805
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Tyrant says, F you to Spring Break, being only one week, knowing almost for certain that I won't be qualifying at RDC in San Diego for In The Groove.

[SPEAKER_08]: World of Warcraft taking over my life, 2DX9 style not at my house yet, Electric Avenue not upgrading to 2DX Red, and school.

2087
02:41:46,131 --> 02:41:57,579
[SPEAKER_08]: Sephiroth 1215 says, F you for 1 gig memory sticks being so damn expensive, and to Best Buy for still not sending out my Lumines, forcing me to play Metal Gear, which is cool, but can get tiring.

2088
02:41:58,249 --> 02:42:01,150
[SPEAKER_08]: and they are telling me that I'm mispronouncing Lumines.

2089
02:42:01,210 --> 02:42:03,270
[SPEAKER_08]: It's actually Luminous.

2090
02:42:03,350 --> 02:42:03,710
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't care.

2091
02:42:05,051 --> 02:42:05,331
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry.

2092
02:42:07,051 --> 02:42:08,491
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Lumines better.

2093
02:42:09,271 --> 02:42:10,552
[SPEAKER_08]: Luminous.

2094
02:42:13,612 --> 02:42:14,593
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe it's the French.

2095
02:42:14,613 --> 02:42:15,053
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2096
02:42:15,093 --> 02:42:15,633
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever.

2097
02:42:15,713 --> 02:42:16,373
[SPEAKER_08]: I like Lumines.

2098
02:42:16,393 --> 02:42:18,193
[SPEAKER_02]: If I didn't know it was French, I'd write it as Luminous.

2099
02:42:18,434 --> 02:42:20,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Not us, it would be F.

2100
02:42:21,795 --> 02:42:24,658
[SPEAKER_08]: Illusion says, F you to last week's robot, tomato, tomato.

2101
02:42:25,078 --> 02:42:28,862
[SPEAKER_08]: Illusion says, F you to last week's robot, chicken, for sucking all kinds of ass.

2102
02:42:28,962 --> 02:42:31,244
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear I didn't laugh even once.

2103
02:42:31,725 --> 02:42:34,488
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what, this last week wasn't nearly as good as the past week.

2104
02:42:34,548 --> 02:42:45,358
[SPEAKER_07]: Honestly, this week, a rumor from what I heard, because I know they have a segment in there that's called Kill Bunny, and I know they're going to be playing it today because it's Easter, and it's Jesus.

02:42:46,099 --> 02:42:50,161
[SPEAKER_07]: as the bride from Kill Bill, Killing the Easter Bunny in Santa Claus.

2112
02:43:00,905 --> 02:43:01,345
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't help it.

2113
02:43:01,365 --> 02:43:02,185
[SPEAKER_08]: The show kicks ass.

2114
02:43:03,086 --> 02:43:06,187
[SPEAKER_08]: Illusion also says, F you to being sick and missing one day of school.

2115
02:43:06,267 --> 02:43:10,188
[SPEAKER_08]: I was so close to getting a perfect attendance certificate, and I didn't get it because of sickness.

2116
02:43:10,428 --> 02:43:10,608

2119
02:43:25,107 --> 02:43:28,848
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to Sampling Masters Mega for making a really catchy song that I can't find.

2120
02:43:29,508 --> 02:43:32,969
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to that PSP golf game I pre-ordered that doesn't come out until June.

2121
02:43:33,609 --> 02:43:38,410
[SPEAKER_08]: And I guess F you to that Stepmania theme for changing the pi that I was looking for.

2122
02:43:39,511 --> 02:43:39,931
[SPEAKER_08]: P-I?

2123
02:43:40,051 --> 02:43:40,351
[SPEAKER_08]: Pi?

2124
02:43:40,371 --> 02:43:40,711
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know.

2125
02:43:41,673 --> 02:43:46,756
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Ranma S says, Fuck you to the Parks Department for canceling our photoshoot in Central Park.

2126
02:43:47,137 --> 02:43:49,859
[SPEAKER_08]: Permit my ass, I'm sending Manfe after you.

2127
02:43:50,759 --> 02:43:52,941
[SPEAKER_08]: Manfe, sorry.

[SPEAKER_08]: Rice, RYC3, says, F you to Planet X slash GameStop for the longest fucking line I've been in at the mall for the PSP.

2130
02:44:06,250 --> 02:44:06,630
[SPEAKER_08]: The end.

2131
02:44:06,670 --> 02:44:07,130
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, guys.

2132
02:44:08,971 --> 02:44:09,612
[SPEAKER_08]: And lastly...

2133
02:44:11,522 --> 02:44:16,463
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Takuya says, F you for not having a 2DX machine in Virginia.

2134
02:44:16,483 --> 02:44:19,264
[SPEAKER_08]: And if I horribly mispronounced your name, my bad.

2135
02:44:23,265 --> 02:44:28,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Another F you segment bites the dust.

2136
02:44:29,627 --> 02:44:29,947
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2137
02:44:30,512 --> 02:44:36,054
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to do a quickie break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge, and then we're going to wrap it up.

2138
02:44:36,134 --> 02:44:44,596
[SPEAKER_08]: So, send some questions to Sky in the chat room with any questions you have for us, and we will get to them when we come back from this break, featuring... Huh?

2139
02:44:47,697 --> 02:44:50,918
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I already played Lemmings during that few, so we'll do the In the Groove thing later.

2140
02:44:51,299 --> 02:44:54,720
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do some Taku, start it off, and we'll be back after this.

2141
02:44:55,280 --> 02:44:57,060
[SPEAKER_08]: A couple songs, just two songs this break.

2142
02:44:57,300 --> 02:44:59,021
[SPEAKER_08]: With Ask Orange Lounge, we'll be back.

2143
02:45:01,623 --> 02:45:02,430
Thanks for watching!

2144
02:45:47,631 --> 02:45:48,712
DarkSakura.com

2145
02:46:50,302 --> 02:46:53,064
[SPEAKER_19]: And in the midst of all these troubled comics...

2146
02:48:11,256 --> 02:48:12,377
Thanks for watching!

2147
02:48:59,549 --> 02:49:05,416
[SPEAKER_16]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

2148
02:49:10,643 --> 02:49:11,103
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask Orange Lounge

2149
02:49:40,883 --> 02:49:42,905
[SPEAKER_08]: Me putting in the chatroom how you ask questions.

2150
02:49:43,105 --> 02:49:44,025
[SPEAKER_08]: But somebody will fill you in.

2151
02:49:44,226 --> 02:49:45,366
[SPEAKER_08]: We have some nice people in chat.

2152
02:49:51,630 --> 02:49:54,572
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2153
02:49:55,093 --> 02:49:58,295
[SPEAKER_08]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

2154
02:49:58,755 --> 02:50:05,760
[SPEAKER_08]: Something people want to know is will we tone it down because we got nominated Broadcaster of the Year and my answer is HELL NO!

2155
02:50:10,953 --> 02:50:15,239
[SPEAKER_07]: No, seriously, somebody was... And for those who want to know, yes, the song is supposed to suck that bad.

2156
02:50:18,676 --> 02:50:22,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Somebody in chat actually asked me, are you guys toning it down tonight because of the Broadcaster of the Year thing?

2157
02:50:22,497 --> 02:50:25,498
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm like, no, we're just kind of, I don't know.

2158
02:50:26,439 --> 02:50:28,399
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the ham, the sedatives in the ham.

2159
02:50:28,459 --> 02:50:31,741
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, actually, I think it is because we've all eaten really well today.

2160
02:50:31,861 --> 02:50:35,162
[SPEAKER_08]: Even though we did not get pie, we ate very well.

2161
02:50:35,202 --> 02:50:35,722
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, Nelly.

2162
02:50:36,062 --> 02:50:36,882
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't make pouty face.

2163
02:50:37,723 --> 02:50:41,244
[SPEAKER_08]: We've all eaten very well, so I think we're just a little happier today.

2164
02:50:42,024 --> 02:50:44,345
[SPEAKER_08]: Nelly has... Please put that on camera.

2165
02:50:44,905 --> 02:50:49,510
[SPEAKER_08]: OrangeSongsRadio.com Nelly will be showing her LEGO creations there on cam.

2166
02:50:49,730 --> 02:50:54,194
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a lot of freaking questions to get to in very little time, so let's get to it.

2167
02:50:56,156 --> 02:51:02,762
[SPEAKER_08]: DJ Takuya says, What are your thoughts on the flyer announcing 2DX12 Happy Sky?

2168
02:51:04,364 --> 02:51:05,605
[SPEAKER_08]: My thought is I like the name.

2169
02:51:06,243 --> 02:51:08,444
[SPEAKER_08]: But, um, you know what?

2170
02:51:08,504 --> 02:51:09,264
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just a flyer.

2171
02:51:09,644 --> 02:51:14,626
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't really start forming opinions until I see, like, some more screenshots and some song titles.

2172
02:51:14,746 --> 02:51:15,426
[SPEAKER_08]: That's my opinion.

2173
02:51:15,926 --> 02:51:17,266
[SPEAKER_08]: Anybody else care to interject?

2174
02:51:19,147 --> 02:51:21,588
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to say, I love the flyer so far.

2175
02:51:21,808 --> 02:51:24,589
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope the timing on the flyer is still pretty good.

2176
02:51:25,289 --> 02:51:29,610
[SPEAKER_07]: The only kickass about that flyer is so goddamn versatile.

2177
02:51:30,851 --> 02:51:35,332
[SPEAKER_07]: Paper Wad, Paper Airplane, little, like, you know, Pac-Man thing.

2178
02:51:36,553 --> 02:51:50,597
[SPEAKER_07]: DJ Takuya also wants to know, what do you think is the future of 2DX for the console with PS3 looming in the future?

2179
02:52:05,999 --> 02:52:07,520
[SPEAKER_08]: Any thoughts on that, DarkSakura?

2180
02:52:35,365 --> 02:52:39,728
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even want to think about the future systems until I actually have something tangible on them.

2181
02:52:40,349 --> 02:52:42,510
[SPEAKER_02]: So speculation, I'm not going to.

2182
02:52:43,491 --> 02:52:43,811
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

2183
02:52:48,094 --> 02:52:48,655
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Dan the Man.

2184
02:52:48,795 --> 02:52:53,038
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, generally the Bimani games are real slow to adapt to new hardware.

2185
02:52:53,618 --> 02:52:57,121
[SPEAKER_00]: Since the PS3 will be backwards compatible...

2186
02:52:58,166 --> 02:53:07,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless they do something crazy go nuts with the arcade version, you can probably expect to see it playable on PS2 for a good long time until they absolutely have to start making it for PS3.

2187
02:53:07,674 --> 02:53:08,674
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2188
02:53:09,815 --> 02:53:10,256
[SPEAKER_08]: Good point.

2189
02:53:11,717 --> 02:53:13,959
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, let's go to a question from BlackDevilerX.

2190
02:53:14,499 --> 02:53:16,280
[SPEAKER_08]: What piece is Loki missing?

2191
02:53:16,561 --> 02:53:20,764
[SPEAKER_08]: I downloaded the zip from the site and noticed that I have a lot of the special pieces.

2192
02:53:20,884 --> 02:53:22,045
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe he can describe it.

2193
02:53:23,169 --> 02:53:25,632
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to hear what special pieces Loki's missing from his list.

2194
02:53:25,652 --> 02:53:27,493
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, how is the Lego construction going over there?

2195
02:53:27,513 --> 02:53:34,280
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the one that looks like a seat, and I'm on step four right now, because I've started running out of black pieces.

2196
02:53:34,781 --> 02:53:44,570
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, for those that tuned in late tonight's show, Loki is building a charger for the Nintendo DS out of Legos, and that's something that's actually on the website over at www.orangenautoradio.com.

2197
02:53:44,630 --> 02:53:46,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for anyone in our chat room.

2198
02:53:46,793 --> 02:53:47,093
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.

2199
02:53:47,560 --> 02:53:53,323
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I freaking download streaming movies as to permanently non-streaming, like recording them?

2200
02:53:54,404 --> 02:53:55,244
[SPEAKER_02]: It's driving me nuts.

2201
02:53:55,844 --> 02:53:58,205
[SPEAKER_09]: Send a private message over to DarkSakura if you know the answer.

2202
02:53:58,225 --> 02:53:59,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

2203
02:53:59,706 --> 02:54:01,047
[SPEAKER_09]: She'll love you forever and ever.

2204
02:54:01,927 --> 02:54:04,589
[SPEAKER_02]: Or send us a copy of the Star Wars 3.

2205
02:54:04,629 --> 02:54:09,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Or send me a freaking non-streaming copy of that new video.

2206
02:54:14,114 --> 02:54:14,654
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see...

2207
02:54:17,170 --> 02:54:20,412
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, yes, Loki, comment on episode 3 trailer since it came out.

2208
02:54:20,432 --> 02:54:24,295
[SPEAKER_07]: There is a downloadable version out there, you just have to find it because I have it on my computer at work.

2209
02:54:26,417 --> 02:54:26,697
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright.

2210
02:54:27,698 --> 02:54:34,563
[SPEAKER_08]: RPGKing7, RPGKing7 wants to know, my question is for everyone in studio and in the chat room.

2211
02:54:35,023 --> 02:54:38,726
[SPEAKER_08]: Can anyone give me any good cosplay websites, please?

2212
02:54:39,166 --> 02:54:43,589
[SPEAKER_08]: I was asked for a job interview I have to cosplay a favorite movie character.

2213
02:54:43,609 --> 02:54:44,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2214
02:54:44,250 --> 02:54:44,650
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.

2215
02:54:45,852 --> 02:54:47,374
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a hell of an interview, I've got to say.

2216
02:54:47,394 --> 02:54:49,155
[SPEAKER_08]: But okay, good cosplay tips.

2217
02:54:49,676 --> 02:54:51,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, who's your favorite movie character?

2218
02:54:51,137 --> 02:54:51,478
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeez.

2219
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:54,881
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to the thrift store.

2220
02:54:54,901 --> 02:54:55,521
[SPEAKER_02]: Modify.

2221
02:54:55,581 --> 02:54:57,283
[SPEAKER_08]: But the question is about cosplay websites.

2222
02:54:57,303 --> 02:54:59,605
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any good cosplay websites that might have tips?

2223
02:54:59,925 --> 02:55:00,626
[SPEAKER_08]: Cosplay.com?

2224
02:55:00,906 --> 02:55:01,447
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there really one?

2225
02:55:02,187 --> 02:55:02,408
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

2226
02:55:02,788 --> 02:55:06,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can order some of those cosplay magazines that they have.

2227
02:55:06,271 --> 02:55:07,232
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you know any of the names of any of them?

2228
02:55:09,177 --> 02:55:09,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

2229
02:55:09,858 --> 02:55:16,023
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's also, I think, Cospa.net or .co.jp is C-O-S-P-A.

2230
02:55:16,103 --> 02:55:17,344
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a Japanese cosplay site.

2231
02:55:17,984 --> 02:55:19,625
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have individual pieces there.

2232
02:55:20,146 --> 02:55:20,386
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

2233
02:55:20,406 --> 02:55:21,987
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see what they look like.

2234
02:55:22,087 --> 02:55:24,449
[SPEAKER_08]: Hopefully some folks in the chat room can help out with that, too.

2235
02:55:24,930 --> 02:55:27,632
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, you can sometimes find costume pieces on eBay.

2236
02:55:27,832 --> 02:55:29,293
[SPEAKER_08]: They sell everything on eBay.

2237
02:55:29,333 --> 02:55:29,994
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pretty crazy.

2238
02:55:30,454 --> 02:55:32,495
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, any help with the cosplay question?

2239
02:55:32,796 --> 02:55:33,456
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I need it.

2240
02:55:33,476 --> 02:55:34,457
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's what I thought.

2241
02:55:35,003 --> 02:55:35,323
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2242
02:55:35,523 --> 02:55:36,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Good luck, bud.

2243
02:55:38,786 --> 02:55:39,486
[SPEAKER_08]: Get that job.

2244
02:55:40,147 --> 02:55:44,950
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're going to dress up as a movie character, dress up as... What did they call her?

2245
02:55:45,010 --> 02:55:47,672
[SPEAKER_08]: What was the name of the diva from the fifth element?

2246
02:55:50,254 --> 02:55:51,155
[SPEAKER_02]: The blue... The diva.

2247
02:55:51,315 --> 02:55:51,755
[SPEAKER_08]: The diva?

2248
02:55:51,795 --> 02:55:52,376
[SPEAKER_08]: Was that just her name?

2249
02:55:52,416 --> 02:55:53,096
[SPEAKER_08]: I thought she had a name.

2250
02:55:53,656 --> 02:55:54,357
[SPEAKER_08]: Dress up as her.

2251
02:55:55,518 --> 02:55:55,818
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

2252
02:55:56,398 --> 02:55:56,919
[SPEAKER_08]: Illusion.

2253
02:55:58,616 --> 02:56:04,148
[SPEAKER_08]: I heard a rumor that DJ Potatoes Company will be publishing the next frequency game.

2254
02:56:04,208 --> 02:56:05,611
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you heard anything about this?

2255
02:56:07,926 --> 02:56:09,087
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think there is a company.

2256
02:56:09,708 --> 02:56:18,434
[SPEAKER_08]: The closest thing I think you might be thinking of is Neon FM, and the reason why it might be getting mixed up with frequency is because Freeze Pop is showing up in Neon FM.

2257
02:56:18,754 --> 02:56:20,855
[SPEAKER_08]: You can look at the website neonfm.com.

2258
02:56:21,696 --> 02:56:25,278
[SPEAKER_08]: But I don't know of any frequency amplitude thing that he's involved with.

2259
02:56:25,398 --> 02:56:29,281
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I guess anything's possible, but a rumor's a rumor as far as I'm concerned.

2260
02:56:29,421 --> 02:56:30,582
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, do you have anything you want to add to that?

2261
02:56:30,602 --> 02:56:35,045
[SPEAKER_07]: I honestly didn't know he had a company.

2262
02:56:36,127 --> 02:56:37,607
[SPEAKER_07]: Prava Laguna was the name of the D.Va.

2263
02:57:07,454 --> 02:57:07,794
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2264
02:57:11,496 --> 02:57:15,959
[SPEAKER_08]: SSJ100Matt What's a good price to whore yourself?

2265
02:57:17,160 --> 02:57:18,641
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll answer just about anything on here.

2266
02:57:19,182 --> 02:57:24,545
[SPEAKER_08]: I spent all my money on the PSP this week and I need money slash zenny slash gil.

2267
02:57:26,603 --> 02:57:28,506
[SPEAKER_08]: How are you going to get Gil by being a whore?

2268
02:57:28,526 --> 02:57:30,629
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to whore out your character in Final Fantasy XI?

2269
02:57:30,930 --> 02:57:32,933
[SPEAKER_08]: I've actually seen people do this in Final Fantasy XI.

2270
02:57:32,953 --> 02:57:37,940
[SPEAKER_08]: They play the little Taru characters, and then they'll say, We'll do the panic dance for 100 Gil.

2271
02:57:41,161 --> 02:57:42,501
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2272
02:58:08,228 --> 02:58:09,708
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't whore yourself for a PSP.

2273
02:58:09,768 --> 02:58:10,488
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not worth it.

2274
02:58:10,889 --> 02:58:13,349
[SPEAKER_08]: PSPs are nice and all, but don't whore yourself for one.

2275
02:58:13,689 --> 02:58:14,509
[SPEAKER_08]: Totally worth it.

2276
02:58:14,649 --> 02:58:15,530
[SPEAKER_08]: Whore yourself out.

2277
02:58:15,930 --> 02:58:17,370
[SPEAKER_08]: A buck a pop if you have to.

2278
02:58:17,650 --> 02:58:18,450
[SPEAKER_08]: Get a PSP.

2279
02:58:19,270 --> 02:58:20,050
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the standard?

2280
02:58:20,551 --> 02:58:21,371
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 for a BJ?

2281
02:58:22,211 --> 02:58:23,271
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's inflation.

2282
02:58:23,291 --> 02:58:25,432
[SPEAKER_08]: 50 for an HJ, 100 for a BJ.

2283
02:58:26,632 --> 02:58:27,932
[SPEAKER_08]: Sucky, fucky, five bucky.

2284
02:58:31,093 --> 02:58:31,733
[SPEAKER_08]: You know what?

2285
02:58:31,833 --> 02:58:32,033
[SPEAKER_08]: Just...

2286
02:58:32,702 --> 02:58:38,125
[SPEAKER_08]: Go on the internet and answer a personal ad from a sugar daddy or a sugar mommy, maybe.

2287
02:58:38,145 --> 02:58:41,026
[SPEAKER_08]: You might even be able to find an old lady sugar mommy, depending on what you're into.

2288
02:58:42,427 --> 02:58:45,429
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can get anything you want just by putting out.

2289
02:58:45,469 --> 02:58:47,130
[SPEAKER_08]: And you only have to put out for one person.

2290
02:58:48,310 --> 02:58:52,712
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it is a sugar mommy, chances are she doesn't have the organs to reproduce anymore.

2291
02:58:52,793 --> 02:58:55,634
[SPEAKER_08]: They've stopped working a while ago, so you might luck out.

2292
02:58:57,375 --> 02:58:58,536
[SPEAKER_08]: Why did I answer that question?

2293
02:59:00,617 --> 02:59:01,117
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm an idiot.

2294
02:59:03,314 --> 02:59:07,218
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's see, we've got a lot of questions tonight, so I'm trying to get through some of them here.

2295
02:59:07,318 --> 02:59:17,029
[SPEAKER_08]: Jaded2005 wants to know, my girlfriend who is listening wants to know, hi girlfriend who's listening, wants to know how did you come up with your name?

2296
02:59:17,549 --> 02:59:19,091
[SPEAKER_08]: How did we come up with the Orange Launch Radio name?

2297
02:59:19,231 --> 02:59:19,591
[SPEAKER_02]: Guilty!

2298
02:59:20,593 --> 02:59:22,755
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, DarkSakura, how did that work?

2299
02:59:25,038 --> 02:59:29,742
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically, DDR Freak Radio was taken, actually.

2300
02:59:29,782 --> 02:59:39,749
[SPEAKER_02]: We were trying to think of Bimani-sounding station names, and Orange Lounge came out just because of lounge music, blah, blah, blah.

2301
02:59:39,949 --> 02:59:40,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were bored on the part.

2302
02:59:42,038 --> 02:59:42,879
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for watching!

2303
03:00:04,161 --> 03:00:05,302
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2304
03:00:22,894 --> 03:00:35,838
[SPEAKER_08]: People think that we're our lounge music station, like we sit here and we play lounge music, and don't get me wrong, lounge music's pretty rad, but we're actually video game radio, so it kind of throws people, they're like, whoa, I was expecting lounge music, what's this geeky stuff?

2305
03:00:38,119 --> 03:00:43,981
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish we had a more interesting story than that, but that's really just it, we just picked a Bomani-related name for our show.

2306
03:00:46,269 --> 03:00:48,712
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe we can fit in one more question.

2307
03:00:49,193 --> 03:00:50,535
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll do it from Legend of Zaku.

2308
03:00:50,575 --> 03:00:52,878
[SPEAKER_08]: And sorry to those of you guys that also submitted questions.

2309
03:00:52,938 --> 03:00:53,899
[SPEAKER_08]: We didn't get to them tonight.

2310
03:00:54,019 --> 03:00:54,520
[SPEAKER_08]: I apologize.

2311
03:00:54,540 --> 03:00:55,381
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll get to them next week.

2312
03:00:55,582 --> 03:00:56,122
[SPEAKER_08]: Send them in later.

2313
03:00:56,643 --> 03:00:58,466
[SPEAKER_08]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, so...

2314
03:00:59,449 --> 03:01:04,952
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that you're moving, and Orange Lounge Radio might have its own room, how do you plan to design it?

2315
03:01:05,412 --> 03:01:07,153
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you going to use a ferret theme?

2316
03:01:29,620 --> 03:01:31,040
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe, you know what I should do?

2317
03:01:31,361 --> 03:01:32,501
[SPEAKER_08]: This would be a great idea.

2318
03:01:33,121 --> 03:01:35,542
[SPEAKER_08]: Allow the listeners to send us decorations.

2319
03:01:35,662 --> 03:01:38,583
[SPEAKER_08]: That way, I don't have to worry about it, and people buy me stuff.

2320
03:01:38,763 --> 03:01:39,363
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

2321
03:01:39,403 --> 03:01:40,563
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an excellent idea.

2322
03:01:40,623 --> 03:01:41,563
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a great idea.

2323
03:01:41,683 --> 03:01:44,664
[SPEAKER_08]: So, the listeners will be decorating the walls of the new studio.

2324
03:01:44,724 --> 03:01:45,365
[SPEAKER_08]: I like that idea.

2325
03:01:47,505 --> 03:01:48,745
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll give you guys details on that later.

2326
03:01:50,606 --> 03:01:50,966
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.

2327
03:01:51,466 --> 03:01:54,207
[SPEAKER_08]: And, yes, actually, the ferret will be hanging from a noose on the ceiling.

2328
03:01:54,647 --> 03:01:57,428
[SPEAKER_08]: Just high enough so that Dark Sakura can't reach it.

2329
03:02:00,555 --> 03:02:03,316
[SPEAKER_08]: Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's Ask Orange Lounge.

2330
03:02:03,356 --> 03:02:06,377
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you guys very much for submitting your questions.

2331
03:02:08,337 --> 03:02:11,098
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's just about it for tonight's show, you guys.

2332
03:02:11,598 --> 03:02:12,679
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just about out of time.

2333
03:02:13,279 --> 03:02:15,279
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks so much for tuning in tonight and listening.

2334
03:02:15,480 --> 03:02:16,720
[SPEAKER_08]: We hope you had a good time.

2335
03:02:17,760 --> 03:02:20,201
[SPEAKER_08]: We're gonna go around now and get everybody's final thought.

2336
03:02:21,181 --> 03:02:22,562
[SPEAKER_08]: DDR Angel, your final thought.

2337
03:02:24,362 --> 03:02:25,703
[SPEAKER_04]: More DDR this week, please.

2338
03:02:25,903 --> 03:02:26,303
[SPEAKER_04]: Just kidding.

2339
03:02:26,643 --> 03:02:27,583
[SPEAKER_04]: I can do it on my own, I guess.

2340
03:02:28,904 --> 03:02:30,324
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan the Man, your final thought.

2341
03:02:30,911 --> 03:02:31,891
[SPEAKER_08]: Bust Kill Brain.

2342
03:02:33,432 --> 03:02:34,433
[SPEAKER_08]: Loki, your final thought.

2343
03:02:38,595 --> 03:02:40,736
[SPEAKER_07]: My final thought is I'm running out of black pieces.

2344
03:02:43,917 --> 03:02:44,497
[SPEAKER_08]: It's almost done!

2345
03:02:44,978 --> 03:02:45,298
[SPEAKER_08]: Woo!

2346
03:02:45,558 --> 03:02:45,858
[SPEAKER_08]: Bye.

2347
03:02:46,680 --> 03:02:51,203
[SPEAKER_08]: My final thought is I'm really craving a marshmallow peep right now.

2348
03:02:51,303 --> 03:02:52,344
[SPEAKER_08]: And no, I'm not going to microwave it.

2349
03:02:53,905 --> 03:02:55,906
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and I get to touch the PSP.

2350
03:02:56,306 --> 03:02:57,667
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, so hot.

2351
03:02:57,807 --> 03:02:59,068
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going to sit over here and oogle.

2352
03:03:00,188 --> 03:03:01,389
[SPEAKER_08]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

2353
03:03:01,829 --> 03:03:02,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are my lasers at?
