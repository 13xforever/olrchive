Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 28th, 2005.
And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.
And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello everybody, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast which you've subscribed to where we talk about video games that don't suck.
And well, sadly some that do because they just sneak in there.
But I think tonight we got a lot of games to talk about that don't suck.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky, I'll be helping you make your way through this show.
Joining me as always, the lovely DarkSakura, also known as Jamie Summers.
Hi!
The perky Jamie Summers.
I'm just faking it.
Oh, okay.
Angsty as always, huh?
Always.
Alright.
Also, say hello to Loki.
Hello.
And how's that DS charger you've been working on?
You were working on it during the three hour show.
I'm on step six of twelve.
Alright.
For those that don't know, he's building a DS charger out of Legos.
Now, explain how this works, Loki.
Basically, it's got the charging cord built into it, and you just set the charger down, or set the DS down on the charger like a, you know, a dock, and there you go, and it holds like, well, six games and three styluses.
Huh, and this is all something you found on a website?
Yeah, I browse a lot of forums.
God bless the internet.
Alright, I like this idea of making your own cases out of Legos, it's a brilliant concept.
Alright, let's get into what's going on in our own personal gaming world this week.
Of course, the PSP launched this past week.
I know somebody in here has got to have had to put their hands on one at some point, and I know it was probably DarkSakura.
Am I right?
Maybe.
Your voice is cracking.
What has been going on in your gaming world?
Silent Hill 3.
Lots of it.
Not the PSP?
and no, because somebody else has been playing his new limb.
Someone who will not be named Dan.
I'm sorry.
Oh, or not named fianc√©.
Yeah.
Or hetero life partner.
All right.
So you haven't really had a chance to play the PSP at all?
I played it.
I played Darkstalkers.
What did you think of it?
It was Darkstalkers.
It was actually really cool.
What do you think of the PSP?
I'm really curious your thoughts.
It's really awesome.
It has the little LED HD screen thingy and plays movies and MP3s and screw the iPod.
Hey, I still like my iPod.
Yeah, but see where you paid $400 for your iPod?
I paid $300.
We paid $250 for the... Whatever.
Okay.
Um...
DarkSakura is your favorite out of the five?
It's the only one I've played, but I really, really, really, really, really like Ridge Racer.
It's pretty, and it has Reiko in it, so it's all good.
Cool.
Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?
I played Final Fantasy XI for ten minutes.
You're cutting back, huh?
I have a Final Fantasy XI story tonight.
It's pretty interesting.
We'll get to it in a minute.
But first, Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world besides the DS Charger?
I've been playing a ton of games, actually.
I bought God of War, which I've been playing a lot of that.
It's really awesome.
They're calling that the Ninja Gaiden of PS2.
What do you think?
No, it's very, very similar to...
Devil May Cry 3 Devil May Cry 3
It basically looks like Lord of the Rings, you know, where you have him, he's just like tossing armies in the air and just like stuff like that.
And there's fireballs and crap that he's throwing, hitting like buildings nearby you and stuff and you're running.
There's another part where you have to go to the Temple of Pandora, which is on the back of a titan, a giant like, you know, monster type thing.
And as you're climbing around the castle, they'll show scenes where you can see the titans walking and everything.
Just tons of detail.
And, correct me if I'm wrong, but there's nudity in this game.
There is full frontal nudity, and there's a sex minigame.
Awesome!
So you gotta love that.
And then it's violent and bloody as hell.
And it's really cool, they've got these...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Wow, alright.
So, definitely, highly recommend, you know, going out and getting that game.
It's awesome.
The other game I got was, um, TimeSplitter 3 because I just love the TimeSplitter series.
I love how they have, they have actually gotten really good with it because the first game's story mode sucked.
Second game, it was pretty good.
Third game, story mode's pretty good, actually.
And, um, they've got a lot of stuff that's, um, been added to it.
Just a lot of, like, you know, um...
A lot of different elements into it.
150 playable characters that you can unlock through the entire game.
And like TimeSplitters, the other games, they have a challenge mode where you play these mini-games that are really off-the-wall strange.
Anything from survival in a haunted house thing to shooting off heads, breaking windows, driving a cat, and playing hoops.
Driving a cat?
Driving a cat.
Okay.
It's a cat with wheels on it.
I don't know.
It's just driving a cat.
Cat racing game.
I don't get it, but that's what it is.
They've got, supposedly, there's a thing that hints a Tony Hawk type game that's in there.
Just like it's so immersive and there's so many characters you can play.
Of course, one of the things that sets Time Sleuthers apart from other games is the ability to make your own deathmatch maps.
Really good system that's only gotten better.
Online gameplay for the PlayStation 2, Xbox, GameCube probably not, but online gameplay for those.
and so that'll be pretty interesting and um just like I said the story mode's awesome it's very very well done like the graphics and everything a lot of fun actually all right and then of course you know the other two games I had of course were the ones I mentioned last week Gran Turismo 4 which I haven't really played much of and then Dog's Life which I must say that this dog is wandering through a world of the most lazy people I've ever seen
That want this dog to like perform miracles for them And I'm like, god damn it This girl's like, I want you to build me a snowman I'm like, it's a fucking dog It doesn't do snowmen, what the hell So I threw poop at her Okay, that's a dog wood So have you played any games you don't like lately?
It seems like you're really enjoying all these games Um No I really did like God of War and stuff And um
Burnout 3 or something, you know, that'd be pretty cool.
But I still like it.
I just have to get into it and play it some more and I'll love it again.
Sounds good.
In my gaming world, not a whole lot new.
I've still been playing Zelda Minish Cap and I'm almost done with it, but that's pretty much been taking a lot of my time.
However, I did get to get my grubby little paws on the PSP that Dan has.
For about seven minutes or so, I got to play either... Now, there's a little controversy over how this game is pronounced.
It's either Lumines or Luminous.
and I guess Luminous is probably the more proper one, but a lot of you have probably been calling this game Luminous.
I got to play this game for about seven minutes, loved every minute of it.
Oh my gosh, that game is hot, I really want a PSP.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Alright, let's get into some gaming news going on.
We'll start it off with the PSP, since of course there's a lot of stuff going on with the PSP.
One of them being the dead pixels going on with the PSPs.
You've probably heard of this, maybe this happened to one of your friends, but a lot of these PSPs apparently have dead pixels, or do they?
Sony is responding to the reports going on right now.
It's commonly referred to as a defect.
However, Sony is saying that this is a problem that actually happens in all LCD screens.
Says Sony, a very small number of dark pixels or continuously lit pixels is normal for LCD screens and is not a sign of malfunction.
Page 13 of the PSP manual says this.
Red, blue, or green spots or black spots may appear in certain locations on the LCD screen.
The appearance of such spots is a normal occurrence associated with LCD screens and not a sign of malfunction.
So what should you do if this is happening to you?
They're suggesting that you try this out for a week or two, but if it continues to bother you, then you can use your one-year warranty that comes with the PSP.
All the details are on page 125 of the manual.
You know what's funny?
Huh?
I swear, I've got this game system called the DS that has two LCD screens.
And guess what?
It doesn't happen there.
Why does it happen on yours?
Okay, but you know what's weird is I have heard of it happening on the DS.
Maybe it's not happening on yours.
But here's the thing, though.
But it's not a common thing because I have a LCD screen at work.
I can tell you this much.
I've had it on for a long time.
It doesn't have any dead pixels in there.
My DS doesn't have any dead pixels in it.
My Game Boy Advance didn't have any dead pixels in it.
Why does your PSPs have a lot of dead pixels in it?
Because you're using chip.
It happens with HDTVs all the time.
So, I...
The advice I heard, and we were talking about this on the three hour program, Dan the man was here talking about the PSP, try putting in the movie that most of you guys got with your PSP, put in Spider-Man and try watching it and see if that unfreezes the pixel.
Just try different tricks like that.
Try doing something a little different and maybe it'll help.
So hopefully we saved you some headache there if you're one of those folks that has the PSP or the dead pixel.
I hope when I get mine though I never have this problem because that will make me sad.
Speaking of the PSP, very interesting.
Some folks are using Wipeout Pure to be browsing the internet.
Loki, I know you love reading about the hack stuff.
What's going on with this?
They're using the Wipeout.
I guess there's a function in the game where you can actually view the website.
I don't think the website's up right now or something.
And so people are actually using it as a proxy or a way to bounce off of it to...
Visit other websites such as Slashdot and Hackaday where I'm guessing this probably was featured in an article.
I actually found the link from Slashdot, but, you know.
Well, Slashdot steals from Hackaday all the time.
Because people that read Slashdot read Hackaday and yadda yadda yadda.
Very interesting.
Not everything works, though.
Some things don't work, like JavaScript, frames.
Of course, you can't expect all that kind of stuff to work.
But apparently, you can actually use Google, because you can use the X button on the PSP, and it brings up a little keyboard, so you can use that to type in things.
Very interesting there.
But here's what you need to be doing on there.
Looking up internet porn.
See, now that would be cool if you can download stuff to the DS.
Just infect your PSP with a Bonzi buddy.
Oh my god, that would be hilarious.
Wait for your PSP to get spyware.
How many days did it take them to install Linux on the PSP?
I don't think they've done it yet.
Oh my gosh, it's a miracle.
Hey, it's only coming, I mean, it takes a while.
You know, like a couple days.
Well, we'll see.
Alright, if you want more information on how to use Wipeout Pure's hidden web browser, head on over to this website.
It's www.fumanchu.com slash p-s-p-d-e-v They'll have all the information there on that.
Hopefully that website doesn't get crashed.
Hopefully it stays up there, but it's probably going to get hit with a lot of folks.
Um...
Also, going on in the PlayStation world, now this is a pretty big story, but we don't have a lot of information at this time.
This was actually another article that was on Slashdot.
But they're saying that according to Japan Today, the U.S.
District Court in Oakland, California has ordered Sony and its U.S.
unit to pay $90.7 million in damages to Immersion Corp.
for patent infringement over controllers used with PlayStation game consoles.
In the ruling, which was handed down Thursday, the federal court also ordered Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment America to stop selling the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles using DualShock controllers as well as more than 40 game software products.
Very interesting if this is actually coming to light.
I mean, there could be a stay.
We don't know.
This is all kind of developing right now, so we don't know.
This will certainly be something we hear about more this week.
But my first thought is, those PlayStation controllers have been around for like 10 years.
It's just now coming to be a patent issue?
What's going on with that?
Is that really how slow our legal system is, or what?
I think patents are 15 years.
I guess.
Expiration on them.
But still, what is going on with that?
Do you think this is going to hold?
Do you think they're actually going to have to stop selling PlayStation?
It's Sony, no.
But... You never know.
They just need to work it out.
Yeah, there's always appeals.
They need to work it out.
I'd be kind of curious of why they waited so long, to be honest.
We have some various online, multiplayer online news.
We have three of them.
I promised we would do a story about Final Fantasy XI.
This is kind of interesting.
This is only going to apply to the Japanese version of Final Fantasy XI, but they're going to be doing a campaign called the Welcome Back Campaign.
It's going to be going on from April 14th to July 13th, and if you are a retired Final Fantasy XI player,
Sign up on the game's official site and you can get your play online and Final Fantasy registration codes reissued by Squeenix, meaning that you can return to the game with your old characters intact.
And you'll be able to play the game free for 30 days!
So they're trying to sucker you back into the addicting world of Final Fantasy XI.
I know all you guys are currently in Final Fantasy XI, but let's say they reinstated this type of similar thing in a game that you've maybe left, like...
DarkSakura for you may be Ragnarok or PSO?
Is this something you'd jump on?
They've given free months, and I hadn't ever re-registered.
Do you think that's the main reason why they do this?
On Ragnarok Online, if you were in the second beta, you'd keep your character forever.
Oh, cool.
So I could go a year from now if I wanted to play RO again, and my character would still be there at her same levels.
Oh, cool.
So...
Do you think this is just something they're doing to sucker people back into it and get obsessed with Final Fantasy again?
Yes.
Probably good business sense.
Loki, what about you?
What do you think of the idea?
Because you're somebody who's still paying for Final Fantasy XI.
Are you a little ticked off that somebody else is going to get 30 free days just because they quit?
Whatever.
Who cares?
I really don't.
I mean, so what?
They get it for free.
I mean, that's just like, you know, all those cable companies out there that, you know, hey, you get the movie channels for free if you, you know, join us.
Then people are like, ah, why are they doing that?
So there's actually retarded people out there that will actually quit and come back to get the free movie channels.
I'm like, you're an idiot.
But whatever, you know, hey, try to get them back because, you know, they've got competition now with World of Warcraft and stuff.
So good luck.
But I don't think it's going to work.
Speaking of World of Warcraft, this week World of Warcraft was patched to version 1.3.0.
And what they've added, like chat bubbles, brand new chat bubbles, quest trackers, and a brand new dungeon, which is called Dire Maul.
Now I know that nobody here is that into World of Warcraft, but it's kind of neat.
I know it's a very insanely popular game.
It is a game I still want to check out as soon as I officially part from Final Fantasy XI, because technically I'm still on it, but not much longer.
I do want to check out at least World of Warcraft, give it a chance.
But I know it's insanely popular, so I'm sure this download, which is going to be 62 megabytes of a chat, a lot of folks are going to be really happy about this one.
They're saying that the chat bubbles are kind of like what you see in EverQuest 2, which should be very interesting.
Hmm.
The new area, by the way, the new dungeon, it's kind of interesting because it seems like whenever they put in new areas in a game, it's always for high levels.
Yeah, you're going to have to be level 56 to 60 if you want to get to this new area, Dire Maul.
Also going on in other online RPGs, the Matrix Online finally started.
So it just launched this week.
Of course, we were talking on the last podcast about when the Matrix Online stopped its beta, did that pretty hilarious sign-off.
Now, tell me, Loki, I don't know how much you've heard about this.
You've been following Matrix Online more than I have.
Is it true?
I thought I was reading something where they've actually hired people to be actors in the Matrix Online.
Yep.
That is their job, to play this game and move the story.
Yeah, they're hired to play the main characters like Niobe, Morpheus, etc., etc., and they're hired to do that.
Wow.
Wow.
They need to hire me.
I know, seriously.
I mean, this just makes me think, my gosh, now kids everywhere will be able to tell their parents, see, you can make a living playing video games.
I mean, wow.
We'll also just ask any game tester, but still.
Still, though, there's a difference between game testing and then actually immersing yourself in this world.
I mean, really.
I would love to do that, you know, but I don't think that after a while it would get kind of old.
I wonder if they switch characters once in a while, liven it up, or how they do that.
That's kind of weird.
I wonder if they're always on 24 hours a day, or what they do.
If they switch, I don't know.
It'd be cool just playing Neo.
Well, apparently they do have Neo running around in there somewhere.
I don't think so.
He's dead.
Oh, I thought he was in there somewhere.
They said that he's spotted.
That's just a myth.
Well, you know, how could they not?
Dead or not?
I mean, you know, Freddy's died how many times?
We'll bring him back and then we'll do a fucking trilogy again.
Yeah, exactly.
So, yeah.
Now, this last bit of MMORPG news I have isn't quite exactly about the game itself, but the ramifications that getting really into an MMO can have.
Sony Online Entertainment just sent some notice that there has been a baby named after a character in EverQuest.
Player Tabitha Ayers gave birth to a baby girl on January 6, 2005 and promptly named her Firiona Valle Ayers.
And these people right here should have their membership cancelled and they should be castrated.
In honor of EverQuest's famous spokes-elf, um...
Very interesting.
Named after an MMORPG character.
Loser.
What do you think?
But I mean, they named babies after rock stars and movie characters.
And all those people should be castrated just as well.
And video game characters.
There was someone that Dan knew that named their kid Melina.
Melina?
Melina?
I actually like the name Melina, but if I were to name my kid Melina, I wouldn't name it because of Mortal Kombat.
We decided that we're naming our first kid Richter.
So is this necessarily worse than that?
No.
Although EverQuest is really stupid.
I think this kid's going to get teased.
This person should have named their kid after a cool game instead of proving to the universe that they're an addict.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I might name... I always thought Strider was a good name for a guy, but not necessarily the same way.
It's not really a name, it's a job.
But it's also a name.
I knew kids named that.
If you change the spelling, alter it a little bit.
Alright, anyway.
Kind of an interesting story there that now kids are getting named after MMOs.
But hey, if they name kids after rock stars in movies, I guess that's just a logical progression.
Alright.
DarkSakura, what did you pick to discuss tonight with our listeners?
This is how to escape from a bad date.
Now this is necessary.
This is good.
How do you do this?
Okay.
You can fake an emergency.
Excuse yourself from the table.
Tell your date that you are going to the restroom to wash up.
Take your cell phone with you.
If you do not have one, locate a restaurant phone that's out of your date's line of vision.
Bring a restaurant matchbook or a business card that has a restaurant's phone number.
Call a friend or relative for help.
Tell them to call you, either on your cell phone or on the restaurant's phone.
and pretend there has been an emergency.
Believable emergencies are personal crisis, my friend just broke up with her husband, she's having a breakdown, I have to go.
Business crisis, my boss just called, she's in Seattle for a major presentation and has lost all of her files, I have to email them to her immediately.
Health crisis, my sister just called, our grandmother is alone and ill.
Leave quickly before your date can protest.
Apologize but refuse any attempt your date makes to accompany you.
If you leave swiftly and without hesitation, your date won't have time to understand what's happening or to object.
And then you slip away unnoticed.
Number 1.
Identify your escape route.
Observe your surroundings.
Take note of the exits, especially the back doors, for the best way out or an alternative.
2.
Plan to alter your appearance.
Think about your most distinctive features and figure out how to hide or disguise them.
The person you are trying to leave is going to see a figure moving past and away at a distance.
Only be focusing on that first impression.
If you are not familiar to him and are uninteresting, you will not get a second look.
3.
Excuse yourself from the table.
Move to the restroom or any private area with a mirror to begin your transformation.
Your date will probably wait 2 or 3 minutes before expecting you to return, so act quickly before he begins looking for you.
4.
Add or remove clothing.
Layering garments will change your body shape and even suggest a different gender.
A long coat will obscure your body type.
So if you're a guy and you want to scare your date off, come back to the table wearing a dress.
Hats are especially useful because they conceal your hair or facial features.
Eyeglasses, whether added or removed, work wonders.
A shopping bag as hand is a handy prop and can be used to hold your belongings.
5.
Change your walk and posture.
If you walk quickly and move slowly, you can stand up straight and hunch over.
6.
Use or remove cosmetics.
Blah, blah, blah.
7.
Change your hairstyle or color.
Rubber band, hairspray, water, gooey substance.
That will help.
8.
Adopt a cover roll.
A waiter in the restaurant may have an apron and be carrying a tray.
If you can manage to procure these items, add or subtract a pair of eyeglasses and alter your hairline or hairstyle, you will become invisible by moving out of the restaurant.
And put on a fake mustache.
Make your move.
Do not look at your date.
You can climb out of a window.
You can use things to break the window, such as a wastebasket, toilet plunger, handbag, or briefcase.
You can even use a paper towel dispenser.
You have to hit it in the center, though.
Or, false fails, get your date to leave.
Say something offensive.
Behave inappropriately.
Send your date on a fool's errand.
Tell him you want to go to a specific nightclub, but explain that it's very crowded and so he cannot go in after you.
But my advice in the end, don't go out with a loser.
Thank you.
Also in gaming news this week.
Actually, if I may say so, there was one on here for how to determine the gender of your date.
We'll have to save that for a future advice column.
Soul Calibur 3 is coming out, but it ain't coming out in the arcade.
And even though Link was so cool on the GameCube, it ain't coming out on the GameCube.
It is a PlayStation 2 exclusive title, Soul Calibur 3.
Namco has announced it.
It'll come out later this year.
So far, they've only announced three new characters.
And I'm going to totally butcher the pronunciations of his name, so just deal with it.
Tira...
Setsuka, and Zasamel.
There's too many letters in that one.
Two returning characters will be coming back for sure as well.
Mitsurugi and Taki.
Mitsurugi.
Sorry, I didn't play a lot of Soul Calibur.
I always played Ivy.
I like the easy to pronounce names.
There was a neat making of file that I didn't really get to watch because somebody else was watching it on his computer.
I do believe it was on GameSpot.
Also, what they're saying about Soul Calibur 3 is that you will be able to create your own character.
So now it's going to be Barbie dress-up Soul Calibur, so that'll be fun.
That is totally up my alley.
But the Zahamuel guy uses a scythe.
That's cool.
I did see the pictures.
One of them looks just like Lulu.
Tira uses a giant chakram.
I think that's the one that looks just like Lulu from... No, it must be the other one.
There's one, I swear, that looks just like Lulu from Final Fantasy X. Like when I saw the pictures.
They're going into some neat weaponry.
That's kind of neat.
But it's kind of a bummer because I really thought Soul Calibur was best on the GameCube and yes, 95% of that is because Link was in it.
So it's kind of a bummer that... Well, actually... Actually, the Xbox one was really good.
Back it up a little bit.
Soul Calibur II was really best in the arcade.
So I'm really surprised that Soul Calibur III is not coming to the arcade.
I don't get that, but whatever.
I guess really good news for Soul Calibur fans that have PlayStations.
Well, and also the arcade market is kind of in a decline.
True.
It's just kind of sad, though.
Because there were some really, like, I thought the Conquest idea was pretty neat and it kept people entertained and having your character being built on there.
It's kind of, I don't know, it's kind of too bad.
But there you have it.
Nobunaga's Ambition
Wow, the strategy.
Yes, you remember this game on Nintendo?
Well, they're actually going to put out a brand new one on the PC this summer.
Now, this news is coming out of Japan, which, and the name when translated means Nobunaga's Ambition Revolution.
It's going to cost $107 in U.S.
funds.
Yeah, that's a lot of money.
Why is it so much?
I guess they're just... Does it come with, like, maps and books and crap?
I have no idea.
No idea.
No idea.
It comes with your own soldier who stays in your house.
There's a teaser page www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp www.gamecity.ne.jp
Nobunaga's Ambition was a cool game though, that's why I had to bring it up, because I remember that game on Nintendo My Ambition, the great game that's so expensive I remember when we went through this thing of trying to sell that game on eBay Did it work?
Did you find a buyer?
I think we got five bucks for it A couple more stories tonight Bungie has revealed that they will be doing nine brand new maps for Halo 2, but there's a catch
They're only going to be available for a fee on Xbox Live.
If you don't have Xbox Live,
I don't know what the hell you're doing with Halo 2 and not having Xbox Live, but if you don't have Xbox Live, you can get a separate $20 add-on DVD that will have all the maps for you.
The first maps will come out on Live late in April.
It's going to have two free maps, so you will get two of them for free, but then you're going to have to do two for purchase.
But they are saying that all the maps will be free at some point on Live by the end of the summer, so I don't know what's going on with that.
but then there'll be five more well I think it's just those four but then there'll be five more on live when the DVD is released but you know there's people out there that play Halo 2 all the time and they will pay the money for these new maps even if they're going to be free in three months you know it absolutely but I don't get the point of the DVD because honestly how can you have Halo 2 and not have live unless well maybe you're the type that plays in the dorm with the local area but
Really, I mean, Halo 2 was made for live, so.
I mean, it has a decent single player mode, but what's the point of the new maps?
Anyway, one more story.
So, did they mention that those new maps would have an actual ending for the game?
No, nowhere in there.
The new quest will begin where you're searching for the end of the game, but unfortunately you will not find it and you'll be utterly disappointed.
But guess what?
There'll be another $20 patch later on where there maybe will be an ending, but we can't guarantee anything unless we figure out more money.
We'll make you buy that Japanese game.
It's $100.
This is probably related to that story we reported on a couple weeks ago about the Korean Xbox site announcing some type of expansion for Halo.
Probably is the same thing.
So I think that answers our questions there.
Maybe not, but probably.
One last story.
Shadow the Hedgehog has a date.
And it's going to be coming out this winter on the Xbox, GameCube, and PlayStation 2.
Being developed by Sega Studios USA.
That explains that VG Cats comic then.
And in other news...
Halo 2 The Search for More Money
Of course, we don't know the rating or the pricing yet.
However, in Shadow of the Hedgehog, you will be able to control whether Shadow is a hero or a villain.
And it all depends on the paths you choose.
It's going to be shooting and racing through over 50 missions.
But can you marry the same sex in that game?
Shadow Fable.
What the hell?
That is a comment way out of left field.
It's just like Fable.
Fable, you can marry the same sex in that game.
Yeah, I know, but Fable and Shadow of the Hedgehog have nothing in common except that Shadow will be on Xbox as well.
Well, shit, I don't know.
I mean, there aren't that many female hedgehogs running around, so, I mean, you know, Shadow... Amy!
Well, one, does she get, you know, four-wayed by, you know, all the other characters?
We just need a Knuckles solo game.
Anyway, I think on that note, we definitely need to wrap things up.
Loki, any parting words for our listeners?
I mean, honestly, what's he gonna do for some lovin'?
My parting words are goodbye and keep your fingers crossed that I beat Minish Cap this week so I have something new to talk about.
DarkSakura, your final.
Piranha Rivers suck.
