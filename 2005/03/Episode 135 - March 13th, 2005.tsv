210958	214238	Well, some, but I'm mostly better.
214858	215518	Sounds good to me.
216619	224420	And in this corner, saving our sound at the last second here tonight, we are having some major sound issues just 30 seconds ago.

229061	230881	All right, and also joining us tonight...
232071	240236	A veteran of our program, a veteran guest, she's been down in the trenches and she knows how to butter the host of the show up.
240576	242137	Say hello to DDR Angel.
242818	243158	Hello.
246780	247200	Alright.
248441	251803	Well, it should be another fun-filled show tonight.
252464	255506	We've got, you know, all the regular stuff you like to hear.
256066	259308	Our weeks, our day, cage match, and who knows what else.
260256	263057	Possibly some Bomani news and all that fun stuff as well.
263617	266297	We will get into that when we come back from a quick break.
267377	272398	And this break, I don't really have an idea for music that I want to hear in particular.
272499	275319	So I think we'll just kind of do some Bomani randomness.
276799	280060	We'll start it off with some Thomas Howard Lichtenstein.
283001	284381	La Senorita, we'll be back after this.
323299	323761	and many more.
350635	373493	Feeling good over you, like you knew she would When she smiles, it's like the sun's shining on your face Falling and stretching, the land of the lame And she's a hot one, California, hula señorita California, hula señorita, hula señorita
463719	469481	I was the happiest guy, that's what everyone said
505015	506757	Thank you for watching.
546604	547104	Thank you.
593188	594970	Whoops, we didn't have another song queued up there.
594990	598574	We were trying to queue up one more song and made a little bit of a mistake there.
599555	601317	It happens, you know, stuff happens.
601337	602699	So Ballad For You was a mistake.
603600	604962	No, Ballad For You was not a mistake.
605182	608125	Just like this next song, The Torture Will Continue Here with Thomas Howard.
608205	609507	One more song, we'll be back after this.
638935	640163	Such a special day
711756	715640	Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.
717422	719404	All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
719464	721446	Hope you enjoyed that break full of Thomas Howard.
723752	725994	He's named after a small country in Europe.
726014	726074	Yay!
746681	750942	If they hate us so much, why are they listening?
751382	754003	Because they know the next break will be something decent.
754363	756844	We play things from the entire Bomani spectrum.
756864	759585	It'll be a break of nothing, but I love that feeling.
760665	765567	Little do they realize it's the Thomas Howard show today, and they won't be getting anything else.
765967	769948	I swear to God, I will be playing Forever Sunshine next break.
771889	772029	Rob?
772069	772149	What?
773767	773947	What?
775648	775828	What?
775988	777329	Play the song and I will kill you.
777789	781091	Well, there's actually damn good reason to be playing Forever Sunshine next break.
781211	782151	And I'll get into that later.
783492	784433	I will kill you with a ferret.
785813	786934	I will kill you in a house.
787134	788194	I will kill you with a mouse.
788535	790356	Will you kill me in a bus?
790396	797559	Wasn't this like six weeks ago when we got into this Dr. Seuss show?
801727	803848	Dr. Redfish Bluefish and you got a deal.
805109	805309	Yes.
805569	806870	Would you piss on a train?
807310	807731	All right.
807751	807931	Stop.
808011	808951	Stop.
810953	817477	Anyway, I was going to say that I liked El Mullet's statement in our chat room over at www.orangehunterradio.com.
817497	818037	Click on chat.
818437	820498	El Mullet says, I love this station.
820558	822159	Giving the fans what they don't want.
823620	824081	That's us.
827182	827262	F.E.A.T.
827282	827442	Mania FM
848453	849654	I only played once this week.
849674	850494	I actually played DDR today.
876835	882299	Granted, I was playing Controller on Ultramix 2 on Xbox Live, but I was actually having fun.
883480	884621	But I'll get into that later.
884861	890285	Let's start off tonight's show as we always do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, starting off with the lovely DarkSakura.
890665	892206	I spent the whole week on codeine.
893187	900272	I went to the doctor, and he gave me some lovely drugs, except I misread the label in my sickness and read teaspoon as tablespoon.
900972	903094	So all Monday at work I was taking this
904515	909036	with codeine syrup at basically triple doses four times a day.
909997	912017	I was high as a kite and feeling a little pain.
914158	914958	I was very happy.
915238	916738	Remember, kids, drugs are bad.
916938	918819	Okay.
920599	922840	But... It's not endorsed drug use.
923240	923640	Yes, we do.
923780	924440	What are you talking about?
926501	931802	We do endorse burping off the... You endorse recreational Waltussin use?
932597	933777	I don't take Waltussin anymore.
934738	935598	It's got sugar in it.
936218	936338	Oh.
937478	940259	But they make sugar-free cola.
943500	945981	I don't know why things that aren't usually funny are funny tonight.
946041	948121	Maybe I'm high on codeine.
948201	948721	I don't know.
951522	954383	You sound like you're still coughing up a little bit of lung butter over there.
955323	957964	Yeah, but it's a good thing because I have a voice finally.
958324	958584	Sort of.
958724	959104	That's good.
959714	962257	I could sing with my CD player today, it was great.
962297	965460	Tonight you don't sound like Grandma Orange Lounge.
967862	968923	I got a pair of three.
968943	971126	Sure did.
972607	977212	But, you know, the week was pretty much normal crap.
977472	979774	I, of course, didn't go to the gym, but I did go yesterday.
980355	981356	I went to spin class.
982100	990284	and I was very sad because the teacher who I wanted to teach a spin class wasn't teaching it because she might be sick with other issues and so I'm really worried.
991284	995506	But my friend... I just ferreted Jamie's laptop.
996326	998147	You touch the precious and you die.
999188	999408	Sorry.
999668	1000808	You go to hell and you die!
1002209	1002509	Anyway.
1003469	1004530	Rob just picked his nose.
1004970	1007291	I did not pick my nose, I scratched my nose.
1010339	1014522	If the webcam phased over here, I'd demand an instant replay.
1016003	1020026	Yeah, too bad that you'd have to be picking your nose for like a minute straight for that to work.
1022347	1024448	Wow, you really did futz with that mic.
1024489	1025629	That's good and loud now.
1027511	1035656	I tell you, it's probably just because pulling chords out over the audio board there
1036340	1042242	Every now and then a cord gets stuck on a knob, and then, you know, the knob turns, and then the audio gets all fucked up.
1043282	1045303	Needs to be, like, in a glass case or something.
1045663	1047543	Loki has his magic gummy bears again.
1047963	1048824	Dun-dun-dun!
1050064	1059507	Seriously, if you guys were listening to the podcast this last week, Loki was, like, turned down to, like, 20% level or something, but it was pleasant, because his anger was subdued.
1060543	1061963	You don't like subduing.
1062003	1062243	Sorry.
1062623	1063064	Sorry, Jamie.
1063104	1063744	I keep interrupting you.
1063764	1065624	I still have to tell you about my damn week.
1065724	1066324	I'm sorry.
1067065	1071666	This is why... For those people wondering why this segment takes so damn long, this is why right here.
1072526	1074686	It's called We Digress.
1076047	1076347	Anyway.
1077647	1080788	I hung out with my friend Melody yesterday who is not Shark's girl.
1082328	1088089	She is a friend of mine who I worked with at the evil student loan company.
1088970	1089330	And she...
1090769	1097754	Met her fiancé through work, and he lives in Delaware, so she's moving to Delaware next month.
1098854	1101096	We're in Delaware!
1101196	1102216	Okay, knock it off.
1103177	1112283	But anyway, this is the last chance I'd really get to hang out with her, so we went to see Constantine yesterday, which I actually liked.
1112763	1119227	And I've even read a little bit of the Hellblazer comics, so where it was a bit different, I actually liked it as a movie.
1119267	1119888	It was pretty cool.
1121312	1131498	I think that's how I like movies that just totally screw with theology and, you know, that's also, I guess, the reason why I like Angel Sanctuary, too.
1134620	1136221	Anyway, we saw that.
1137142	1138983	I went to her apartment to meet her cat, Simon.
1139123	1140524	She went to my apartment to meet Shermie.
1141224	1143546	She took two pictures of me and five pictures of Shermie.
1147941	1153563	Anyway, I took her to meet Dan, and Dan did his stuff he was working.
1154083	1155823	Then we went to Chevy's.
1156263	1158264	Did he manage to sell any ignition pads?
1158944	1159404	I don't know.
1159444	1159944	I don't care.
1161245	1162005	I don't keep up with that.
1162025	1163125	He's off to an inventory tonight.
1163405	1164626	Oh, okay.
1165486	1168287	But we went to Chevy's, and then went to Cheesecake Factory.
1168327	1169727	I decided to make yesterday my cheat day.
1170767	1174828	So the box of Samoas is going to wait until my birthday, because that's my next cheat day.
1175529	1176769	I'm having two cheat days next month.
1179536	1186440	Um, then we went back, um, and Dan came home when we were hanging out at my place because I was burning off a copy of Battle Royale for her.
1187400	1196064	Um, and, uh, we watched The Ring and, uh, the part of, uh, An Evening with Kevin Smith.
1196424	1197645	Isn't The Ring 2 out this week?
1198865	1199786	I don't know, isn't it?
1199806	1200606	Um, this Friday.
1201507	1201667	Hot.
1201707	1203007	Holy shit, I have to go.
1203027	1204388	Because,
1205104	1230944	I'm looking to see, I want to see because I heard they were trying to incorporate some stuff from the books and I really like the books over the movies because the books go in such a completely different direction which I kind of wish the movies had but it would not have been realistic so I'm really curious and otherwise today's been kind of oh yeah today I actually was outside taking pictures of nature
1231428	1236851	Because for my Photoshop class, I have to do a composite of three pictures into a fantasy setting.
1238172	1241594	And I've got one of a bridge and two other ones.
1242614	1243255	I'm going to play with them.
1243295	1244716	I got my pictures from Alabama developed.
1245436	1247357	I managed to spend $75 at Walgreens.
1248518	1250959	Do they let you do digital photography in photo classes now?
1251179	1253521	Because when I was in college, you had to use the old cameras.
1253641	1254581	This isn't a photo class.
1254881	1255842	This is Photoshop.
1256342	1256943	Oh, okay.
1257023	1257643	Yeah, that makes sense.
1258663	1260465	And he doesn't care how we get him as long as we get him.
1260885	1261225	I got you.
1262575	1267797	Um... But... That's pretty much it.
1267817	1270057	I got to hang out with Dan and Julie today.
1270677	1272798	And then Dan had to go to work and I went back home.
1274778	1274898	Ah!
1276579	1276939	Alright.
1277439	1277859	Anything else?
1278960	1279600	I like fire.
1280120	1280620	Okay.
1281120	1282281	But that's it for your week and your day.
1282921	1283361	Oh, yeah.
1283461	1283741	Alright.
1284061	1284401	I'm done.
1284601	1285081	Moving on then.
1285121	1285861	Loki, how was your week?
1285901	1286282	How was your day?
1287482	1287602	Um...
1288314	1288994	It was okay.
1289275	1290195	I didn't do much.
1290315	1293677	I just, um, played Final Fantasy XI.
1294137	1296639	And, um, Attic.
1297179	1297879	What else did I do?
1297960	1299100	I know there was other crap.
1299200	1305604	Oh yeah, I went and saw, um, what was it, uh, Robots yesterday.
1306064	1307025	And that was okay.
1307825	1308425	It was free.
1308886	1309766	I got a lot of popcorn.
1310006	1310667	So that was all good.
1311947	1316330	And then, um, yesterday we watched, um, SpongeBob SquarePants.
1323492	1329637	I'm a goopy goober, yeah You're a goopy goober, yeah That movie was so random, it's just...
1332373	1333534	I don't even know.
1333614	1339299	I mean, I was kind of a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants before, but now, like, oh my god, he's so awesome.
1339559	1342641	I can safely say I've never, ever, ever, ever seen any.
1342721	1343822	You need to see the movie.
1344042	1344402	It is awesome.
1344442	1345283	And Blackout refused to.
1345383	1349226	Honestly, I hate SpongeBob SquarePants, but the movie was good.
1349446	1350147	I liked the movie.
1351129	1354951	I find Spongebob Squarepants to be completely retarded and just annoying.
1355491	1359253	And the movie was just, it was so different from the show.
1359413	1364755	It was kind of weird, because it was actually, you know, very random, sort of like... It was what Nellie said, it was a stoner movie.
1365155	1366516	It was a stoner movie.
1366956	1372218	It was just like, and it was like, they had so many homosexual innuendos in that movie.
1372658	1376180	Like, especially the ending, where they do like a kiss type ending.
1377253	1380356	I don't know if there was a Kiss movie, I'm sure there was.
1380856	1388962	But it's totally the Kiss ending, and then Patrick is wearing fishnet stockings.
1389062	1390504	Yes, and stilettos.
1390584	1391504	And stilettos.
1393065	1394006	And stripper boots.
1394547	1395447	It's just weird.
1396268	1399510	I don't know, it was kind of funny.
1399690	1400931	It was just completely different.
1400951	1404294	And then earlier in the week I had watched White Noise.
1405954	1409816	And that movie was, yeah, it was weird.
1411156	1415818	They're just so gonna... It just, like, had an ending that made no sense in that movie.
1415858	1428504	It's just, you're leading up, you find there's this guy, you know, and there's these three ghosts that have been killing people, and then, you know, the resolution to the movie, the ghosts break every bone in this guy's body and throw him off a building.
1428584	1428944	The end.
1429844	1431185	I was like, oh, gee, thanks!
1431505	1431925	That's nice.
1434172	1434752	Will sell soul for Gil
1466266	1468807	I just did nothing, like usual.
1469247	1472248	Still waiting for my damn interview for the game sales position.
1474288	1474768	Still waiting.
1477129	1477589	Okay.
1478229	1478630	And that's it.
1479490	1479810	All right.
1479970	1480790	Angel, how was your week?
1480830	1481250	How was your day?
1481710	1481970	Oh, wait.
1482050	1484471	Actually, before we get into that, I actually got a clip.
1484971	1485451	Sorry, Angel.
1485752	1488072	I got a clip of that song, Girls Butts.
1488372	1490693	Miklatov somehow had it, and he sent it over to me.
1496563	1497564	Aw yeah!
1497704	1498004	Aw yeah!
1523450	1524291	I wish this week never existed.
1524311	1524531	Ever.
1524571	1524731	Ever.
1524751	1525531	I wish it never existed.
1546437	1549978	Monday through Wednesday was just fine.
1551239	1553299	And all that good stuff.
1554360	1559101	Went to school and worked a little and just all that other stuff.
1560542	1561842	And then Thursday was school.
1562663	1566564	And then I come to find out when I come home as soon as I sat down for my computer.
1568086	1590474	that my friend had passed away and it's one of the guys that I knew two years in the DJ field you know on the radio and stuff and let's just say since Thursday it's been kind of a screwed up four days and sleep's been a joke and just you know
1591394	1602342	Me and my other friends have been hanging around there and just comforting each other and just you know stuff that you need to do when somebody passes away and just I haven't felt this much like
1603425	1607651	I just had a really hard week or at least the last four days.
1622392	1638477	It's getting better, but, you know, there's just little things that remind you of this, you know, somebody, like, you'll be walking down the street and you'll see somebody wear a shirt, and that shirt, like, reminds you of the person that you just lost, and just little stuff like that.
1639157	1647620	And so, yeah, I've been grieving all week, except for the first three days of the week, so it's been pretty shitty week.
1648560	1650181	And I really don't really want to think about it.
1650841	1651561	Anyway, that's it.
1653925	1657228	I'm sorry to hear about it, and I hope things get better for you and everything.
1659390	1660792	Wow, how the hell do I follow that?
1661633	1661873	Angel?
1663334	1664275	Being here helps.
1664535	1666417	I think we should play the Girls Butts songs again.
1666517	1667138	Oh, jeez.
1667658	1672083	Actually, maybe if I play the Girls Butts song again, Angel will feel a little better.
1685031	1685431	DarkSakura.com
1713222	1715023	Did Girls Butts get rid of your cough?
1715343	1716644	I guess so, wow.
1717044	1719045	Girls Butts has healed me!
1719445	1722626	I felt the power of the Girls Butts!
1723167	1724547	Praise the Lord!
1724627	1726828	Oh my God, this song cures cancer.
1726948	1731830	Don't tell me that Orange Lounge doesn't better your life, everybody.
1741044	1741905	My week and my day.
1742285	1743185	Shit, what did I do?
1743205	1745247	Um, not a whole lot.
1746167	1746708	Nothing that exciting.
1746768	1750010	I also watched the SpongeBob SquarePants movie Friday night, which I thought was awesome.
1750831	1753412	And also watched this other movie last night, which was very odd.
1753452	1754753	It was called The Final Cut.
1754993	1756795	Final Cut with Robin Williams.
1756935	1759636	Which, I'd never heard of this movie in theaters.
1760057	1760937	It was very limited.
1761318	1762959	Very, very, very limited, apparently.
1763519	1765240	So, there was that.
1765780	1766361	And, um...
1768846	1774569	I thought that movie was very... Well, obviously, it's not what you'd expect from a Robin Williams movie, because it was very dark.
1774709	1776690	He also did the one-hour photo.
1776710	1776970	Yeah.
1777290	1777850	I saw that one.
1777870	1778491	That one's weird.
1778511	1778851	Yeah.
1779491	1782353	So, all sorts of, like, very unsettling movies there.
1784733	1786054	But, yeah, it was different.
1786154	1786795	But I liked it.
1786875	1788316	It was a thought-provoking movie.
1788336	1790198	It kind of made you go, hmm, that's interesting.
1791299	1793581	Friday night I went out to the bar, and it was cool.
1794362	1798045	Because there was this guy that thought it was cool that I played games, so we talked for a little while.
1798606	1801308	And it was weird, though, because he's not... He's kind of...
1802949	1804390	Not a big Nintendo supporter.
1804730	1807891	So I had to talk to him about why I believe the GameCube is awesome and all that.
1807971	1809092	So it was interesting.
1810132	1814414	And outside of that, you know, just same old stuff.
1815614	1818555	Went out to karaoke earlier this week because I'm a total karaoke whore.
1818575	1818955	I love it.
1819656	1821676	Actually, I went twice this week.
1821716	1823077	That's what a big karaoke whore I am.
1823477	1827401	I went on Monday night when it's not the usual karaoke guy that I'm used to.
1827941	1828842	It just wasn't the same.
1829223	1830003	It really wasn't the same.
1831905	1832406	And that's that.
1833186	1833707	That's it for me.
1835268	1836950	Alright, let's see.
1839032	1841054	We're going to get into another break here.
1841930	1855605	and in this break we're going to play two songs and these two songs have something in common and I'll talk about what these songs have in common when we come back after this you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back
1971192	1972974	Thank you for watching!
1996926	1997428	DarkSakura.com
2017563	2020626	Music, Music, Music, Music, Music,
2043700	2045285	Those two songs have something in common.
2045526	2048998	If you haven't figured it out yet, we'll play two more songs that should give you a little bit of a hint.
2110522	2123385	I didn't notice the light with this beam Fly away to fantasy Feeling the insolence Until we reach eternity
2164501	2165263	Do you feel it?
2188720	2189552	Thanks for watching!
2243668	2244290	You can feel it.
2274108	2281492	Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?
2281512	2281692	I... what?
2300163	2304324	Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?
2306564	2309265	Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!
2314306	2326088	We haven't had an excuse to play that one in a while, but since you guys were talking about, you know, The Ring 2 coming out soon, and you talking about, you know, you watching The Ring this week and stuff.
2326108	2327869	You can totally see up my nose in this picture.
2328289	2329549	You know, that makes for great radio.
2331389	2332629	I like Dan's smile.
2332649	2334950	He's like, ah.
2336210	2339011	He looks like Spongebob did in that movie when he got all happy.
2339391	2341171	Do not compare my man to Spongebob.
2342892	2343212	All right.
2343272	2350973	Anyway, so if you didn't figure it out, Forever Sunshine and Regret, a song from Keyboard Mania that we played in there, too.
2350993	2351834	You may not have recognized that.
2352174	2355754	Those are two songs that are assumably in the next song pack.
2355794	2358515	Now, we haven't heard anything official yet, but...
2359588	2360209	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2378425	2380807	So people are just pretty much assuming they've got them right.
2381147	2384450	So Regret and Forever Sunshine, two of the songs that are going to be in there.
2384490	2387112	And we'll play some of the other songs a little bit more later.
2387152	2392396	And of course, I Feel the Junk, Circuit Mix, and More Deep were songs that were in the last song pack.
2392416	2393137	So a little hint for you.
2393497	2398301	So yes, boys and girls, you get to download Forever Sunshine in the next song pack for DDR.
2398601	2399782	Doesn't that make you excited?
2402244	2402384	Oh.
2404046	2404426	Yay.
2406548	2406888	We.
2407749	2407909	Now,
2408945	2409045	Hello?
2409065	2409225	Hello?
2409245	2409365	Yeah?
2436840	2439501	Hi, wow, you're really quiet right now, but that's alright.
2439541	2441062	This is Rob on Orange Lounge Radio.
2442203	2442843	Hey, what's up?
2443163	2443704	Not a lot.
2444124	2448466	So, tell me about Forever Sunshine being in the next song pack.
2450227	2451748	What do you mean tell you about it?
2451848	2456451	It's there, and it's awesome, and everybody who hates it should just go and die.
2458552	2460593	Why did you put, why Forever Sunshine?
2460633	2461473	Is this your fault?
2462174	2462734	Did you do this?
2462754	2463534	Yeah, it's my fault.
2463874	2464755	How is this your fault?
2466021	2468962	Well, I picked a whole bunch of songs that I personally like.
2469322	2471442	I didn't care if the other people liked them or not.
2471982	2477923	Like Forever Sunshine, and like Follow Laika, That's All Me Right There, OGC, Regret.
2478343	2481984	Those are songs I like, and I was like, well, they'd be cool for DDR, so I suggested them.
2482244	2485324	But Forever Sunshine was already in DDR, and it sucks!
2486624	2489365	Yeah, well, it was that, or you could have let them move.
2490345	2491845	I'd almost rather have let them move.
2491865	2493086	Would it be like a junk circuit mix?
2493106	2494346	You don't count now, do you?
2494546	2495446	I guess not.
2496869	2497629	I'm mad at you.
2498710	2499770	That's okay.
2499910	2503012	You can take it out on me by hitting me at E3 when you go.
2503852	2508094	I will.
2508234	2512136	Now, are we going to expect to see crappy songs that you picked in the next song pack?
2512776	2513396	Heck yeah.
2513476	2521620	I mean, if you remember way back when Ultramix 2 was done and they started announcing stuff about song packs, one of the other Vivid members
2522031	2523232	DarkSakura, any choice words for Sigurd?
2550862	2552543	Dot, dot, dot.
2555744	2559325	Loki, any choice words for Sigurd on his selection of Forever Sunshine?
2561746	2562887	Um, I don't care.
2563067	2565368	Because I already have that stupid song.
2566228	2567149	Inceptmania.
2567549	2568649	Uh-huh.
2569289	2573311	I'm not buying no fucking song pack, nor am I getting Ultramix 2.
2573391	2575352	You don't even have an Xbox, so you don't count.
2576292	2577753	Well, I have an Xbox shell.
2580134	2580574	But, um,
2581297	2582998	Dude, hello?
2583038	2585841	What the hell?
2585861	2590004	Let's pick Forever Sunshine, because that's so much better than... I can't hear Sigurd.
2590024	2590705	What, Sigurd?
2590745	2593227	Oh, I was saying, what's cooler than Forever Sunshine?
2593247	2593908	You can stay $5 for that.
2593928	2594768	You should still privilege.
2608453	2613361	I don't know, how about every other Bomani song in existence is cooler than Forever Sunshine?
2613381	2617047	I have an idea!
2617628	2619211	Forever Sunshine rocks!
2619753	2626880	Let's just get that, because, you know, songs like The Fall, or Hellscraper, or, I don't know, whatever else we can put out there.
2627401	2636430	Oh, maybe anything that's in 2DX, you know, Ted Style, or anything below that, or, I don't know, Beat Manium, you know, all those songs suck.
2636470	2639112	Hold on, hold on, hold on.
2641477	2644979	One song that's appeared in only one mix, you know, just appear out of nowhere.
2644999	2646259	We've got 2DX songs.
2646299	2647820	We don't need more 2DX songs.
2647840	2648801	We're done with 2DX.
2649201	2654743	That's why I take songs from Keyboard Mania and Drum Mania and one-time uses in DDR.
2654944	2656224	Sigurd, I have a question for you.
2656264	2657165	Do you like the Muppets?
2658625	2659006	No.
2659506	2662207	Well, because Forever Sunshine sounds like Miss Piggy singing it.
2663268	2665869	Did you know that Malcolm in the Middle guy sounds like Kermit now?
2669139	2671420	Is the Rainbow Connection going to be in the next song pack?
2671460	2672980	That's what I'm curious about.
2673000	2674461	The what?
2674981	2676121	The Rainbow Connection.
2676181	2676742	Oh, forget it.
2678702	2679302	Forget it.
2680483	2682063	My insults are lost on you.
2682964	2684164	They really are.
2685204	2685885	Alright, well thanks.
2687185	2690526	Anything else you want to share with our listeners, Seeger, before I hang up on you out of pure anger?
2691827	2694328	I guess they should just learn to deal with what they're given.
2695548	2696048	That's it.
2696368	2698429	They should shut up and quit being like DDR freaks.
2699981	2702083	Alright, I'm gonna let you go.
2703284	2703605	Okay.
2703625	2703945	Bye.
2704225	2704606	Bye.
2705527	2706267	I'm still mad at him.
2708069	2709971	Forever Sunshine and DDR, what the hell is that?
2710471	2717118	It's people like him that come up with wonderful ideas like stealing the karaoke revolution songs and put them in DDR extreme.
2718066	2727190	You know what I, speaking of Karaoke Revolution and Bomani, you know what I, like, was announced like a month ago and I completely forgot to mention on this program until just right now?
2728070	2730491	That Bomani Karaoke Revolution game got cancelled.
2730952	2737054	So those of you guys that wanted to sing at Love Shine, sing Love Shine at home and stuff, sorry.
2738955	2739816	No karaoke for you.
2742237	2742457	Funny.
2745558	2747499	Because I saw, um,
2748663	2749963	The Forever Sunshine was in it.
2752564	2760507	Yeah, I guess Forever Sunshine was in the next Karaoke Revolution game, the Mamani one, and so they had to cancel it because they realized that that sucks.
2763108	2769490	They couldn't put Forever Sunshine in there because, I don't know, it just sucks.
2771618	2773379	I had something there, but it just went away.
2773399	2775600	I'm going to eat more gummy bears.
2776200	2779942	Out of curiosity, you started off last week with a five pound bag of gummy bears.
2779962	2780903	How many pounds are left?
2782383	2783524	Probably like a pound and a half.
2784284	2785105	That's a lot of gummy.
2786766	2787506	I helped, though.
2787566	2788066	I did help.
2788727	2790207	I have about a pound left.
2790627	2792228	I was offering gummy bears to people.
2792288	2795290	I said, hi, I know these are my roommates, but you want some gummy bears?
2797171	2797591	We'll get more.
2798137	2799618	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2822412	2825874	Dance Mania Speed G4 has been announced.
2826454	2829837	You know, I have issues with this already.
2829857	2830157	Why?
2830277	2830577	Why?
2830937	2833279	Because there's G4 in it.
2833659	2836461	Well, that's the name of the album is Dance Mania Speed G4.
2836841	2838982	And how appropriate that it should be named that.
2840003	2844345	You get songs like Toxic, the Trance Speedo mix by Helen.
2845746	2850309	And you get other songs like Let's Groove by Beatbox featuring DJ Speedo.
2851346	2853888	and a song called Wookiee Wookiee by Jenny Rom.
2855448	2857930	And then Piano Concerto No.
2857950	2861412	1 in B-flat minor by Speedmaster.
2861832	2864073	So it's like they're mixing that classical speed thing.
2864113	2864514	Speedmaster!
2864534	2864934	Speedmaster!
2865054	2868876	And how can we forget Hostile Takeover, the B4 is a beat mix?
2869557	2870357	Gotta love that one.
2871017	2878101	And then, of course, this has got to be the coolest thing that's on there, Theme from Miami Vice by The Extra Terror Sound.
2878142	2878582	That's cool.
2879406	2881947	But it's a speed version, so I don't know what to expect from that.
2884588	2886749	Also, Smoke on the Water, that's worth mentioning.
2887470	2889231	You guys will want to check out the full song list.
2889271	2894933	It is posted to our website, www.orangelongeradio.com But you know what's even cooler?
2895554	2895734	What?
2895754	2896854	You know what else is coming out soon?
2896934	2897134	What?
2897414	2899415	Airwolf Season 1 on DVD.
2900736	2901096	Really?
2901636	2901917	Really.
2902657	2903057	Interesting.
2903657	2907019	And you know what Dance Mania Speed G4 doesn't have that Airwolf has?
2907039	2907119	What?
2908092	2911154	A fucking kick-ass helicopter, that's for sure.
2914237	2915898	Now that I've successfully... I have one helicopter.
2916979	2918980	Yeah, but you don't have a cool helicopter like... I do.
2919121	2921202	This was like Thunder in Paradise, but in the air.
2922103	2922783	But I have a Humvee.
2922803	2925606	And without, you know... Hulk Hogan.
2925646	2926887	Oh my god, I had the coolest dream.
2928848	2931710	I dreamt I really had a Humvee with a missile turret on it.
2932311	2933251	And what were you doing with it?
2933432	2934352	It was just my normal car.
2934893	2935133	Oh, okay.
2938546	2941847	So you were in, I don't know, Cruisin' World?
2944409	2945549	I think it was Cruisin' World.
2945569	2946510	Wasn't it that had the Humvee?
2947510	2948130	That was cool.
2948370	2953613	I used to always use the three-wheeled truck.
2958395	2959436	Alright, other Bomani news.
2959456	2959956	Let's move on.
2960216	2960936	School Bus!
2963789	2964910	You know DDR Freak?
2964950	2966192	You've ever heard of that website?
2966272	2967213	I'm not sure if you've heard of it.
2968695	2969596	You know it's a site.
2970116	2974020	And you know they actually syndicate our program on Friday nights over on DDR Freak Radio.
2974361	2974561	Really?
2974581	2975943	Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it.
2975963	2976643	Check them out someday.
2976724	2977264	Yeah, we should.
2978185	2982310	DDRFreak.com turned five years old this week.
2983251	2985073	Five years old.
2985990	2987451	How old does that make you feel?
2987511	2990954	Because I remember when DDR Freak did not look like it did today.
2990994	2993716	It didn't even have the same address and everything.
2993896	2995677	I remember it being green.
2997038	3001761	And did it have the same bad grammar that we've learned to come in love?
3002022	3002602	Oh, indeed.
3003583	3009547	I remember having the biggest post count back in the day.
3010327	3010987	What happened with that?
3011027	3012128	Why is it that you had the biggest post count?
3012148	3013728	Because I don't really post that much.
3015249	3017750	I just watch threads now, that's all I do.
3018430	3019651	Okay, this is stupid.
3020271	3021451	No flames here, moving on.
3022352	3024253	Nothing to see here.
3024273	3028974	You can't lock a thread for being too stupid, but it has to be pointlessly stupid.
3030255	3036477	So I thought maybe we could go around and kind of talk about the first time we visited DDR Freak and what we thought of it.
3037298	3037458	Loki.
3037498	3037758	Loki.
3039088	3042611	I read, this is a tribute, by the way, to DDR Freak Turning 5.
3043372	3052780	I read the, what was it, DDR USA, the manual, and in the back there was a special thanks to DDRFreak.com.
3052840	3054342	That's how I first found the website.
3055803	3061208	To which then I first found the regional forums, to which I found the link to Sakpamani.
3062987	3064608	All links to the DDR USA manual.
3064669	3066070	Yes, there are people that actually read that.
3066330	3067151	Yes, I was that bored.
3067251	3071094	I was gonna say, that's like tiny-ass print in the back of the manual there.
3072235	3073116	I was that bored.
3074117	3077860	So on your first visit to DDR Freak, you learned about the locals here, so that's cool.
3077900	3078080	Yep.
3078601	3078861	Alright.
3079461	3081924	DarkSakura, your first visit to DDR Freak.
3082644	3086067	This had to have been... It was right before AX2000.
3088653	3106967	So, actually right around the time of AX2000, because I was just getting into a lot of it, I was looking for more people who play, and I just started posting there, found people who had other interests, and then I randomly made the Sacramentals thread on DDR Freak and...
3108507	3111009	And oh my god, did we get yelled at in that thread?
3111029	3112250	Because we were random.
3112590	3118254	And I'll tell you what, it was nothing compared to the random chat you see today on DDR Free.
3118314	3120996	But man, people were like, you guys are losers, right?
3122497	3122957	You know what?
3123117	3124298	They didn't want to see it.
3124358	3125358	They didn't have to click that thread.
3128381	3128741	Amen.
3129361	3130922	How'd you end up becoming a moderator over there?
3131683	3133424	Because I was a good babysitter.
3134426	3138787	I had this habit of insinuating myself between people's arguments just because I didn't want to see all the crap.
3139567	3141247	And I posted so much I was available.
3141267	3143528	This was when I was working at GNC.
3144368	3147069	I was available all the time and posted all the time.
3147569	3150249	And I had pretty good people skills, so I got offered the position.
3151990	3153310	Right as my cable went down.
3155790	3157491	So, but it was pretty cool.
3157971	3158811	I still like doing it.
3158851	3159271	I kind of...
3159870	3160571	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3177768	3193761	and I do remember the boards were green and I remember a lot of people that were posting were all in the Bay Area and they were talking about the songs they were playing and passing and the freestyle stuff and I was just kind of like these guys are sick, obsessive little freaks which is really funny in retrospect that I thought that
3195484	3198246	But then I lurked for a long time.
3198426	3201569	I lurked for probably a good two months.
3201729	3206313	I remember when I was lurking, they were not using a PHP board.
3206353	3210196	They were using some other type of web board when I first was looking at it.
3210236	3210877	I was lurking at it.
3211197	3213619	And then when they did the PHP board, I think that's when I finally signed up.
3214159	3216041	But it's not the same one that we know now.
3216101	3218503	Like, there was another board in between.
3218523	3219584	I don't even remember.
3219644	3221425	But that's when I signed up and stopped lurking.
3221685	3224107	And it was probably about the same time as that Sacramentals thread.
3224407	3229612	Because I remember us all taking that trip to the Bay Area to play Parapara for the first time.
3230072	3230793	That was pretty awesome.
3232134	3233135	That was really fun.
3233375	3235076	So that was my first DDR Freak experience.
3236057	3237158	Angel, do you remember?
3238979	3239279	Yeah.
3239860	3242182	Unfortunately, I was the late bloomer out of all of you guys.
3242222	3242822	But that's okay.
3244224	3245549	Actually I'll blame it on Orange Lounge.
3247533	3267430	Uh, probably around 2002 or so, so, you know, like I said, I was a late bloomer out of all of you guys, but, uh, it's pretty cool, I still pretty, I don't do the forums, you know, as far as posting is concerned, because someone took my name, so, you know, and I can't think of anything else that's cool, so, um, you know, because my handle's my handle.
3268771	3275056	So, I just, you know, look and, uh, read stuff, but other than that, no.
3278692	3281853	Happy birthday to you folks there at DDR Freak.
3281893	3283474	You're turning five years old.
3284354	3286175	Now you all can be placed in kindergarten.
3287315	3290636	So maybe you'll learn something.
3291857	3294978	But man, that just kind of shows how long DDR itself has been around.
3295038	3295778	It's kind of interesting.
3297479	3301760	It's very interesting too to go to DDR Freak and look at the headlines and they're all about in the groove.
3301780	3305541	It kind of shows you where this thing's going.
3306222	3306922	Very interesting.
3308618	3314260	Alright, let's take another quick break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.
3314520	3316101	Maybe we'll do ourselves a list list tonight.
3316121	3318321	We haven't done one of those in a while, and I have a good idea for a topic.
3318401	3319142	That sounds like fun.
3319342	3323643	So we'll do that, and we'll also open up the Skype line for those of you guys that want to call in.
3324283	3326664	So in this break, you get some Bomani Potpourri.
3326704	3329885	There's really no rhyme or reason why we're playing these songs, we just want to hear them.
3329965	3331206	So we'll be back after this.
3337560	3343368	Dream a dream together, a dream that is real
3420673	3422574	One, two, three, four!
3422714	3423434	I love you
3468958	3469819	Come on, come on!
3668260	3673645	Easier to Dance To Than That Freaking Catch-Up Song Orange Lounge Radio
3685498	3685939	www.orangeofficer.com
3705098	3706279	House of Wax
3730854	3731074	No, no.
3731094	3731714	Which I will not see.
3731854	3734715	We've got a call already, so we don't have to worry about Paris Hilton chat.
3734935	3736035	Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
3736816	3737296	Hey, Sky.
3737336	3737776	Siggy here.
3737936	3738676	Hello, Siggy.
3738716	3739216	How are you?
3740076	3741377	I'm doing... I fell asleep.
3741477	3742237	I just woke up.
3743177	3745878	So you fell asleep and you missed the first part of Orange Lawns Radio?
3746298	3749959	Well, just only, you know, just the first 30 minutes.
3750039	3750419	That's all right.
3750619	3752600	You know about the best thing that you missed so far?
3753340	3753600	What?
3755581	3759362	Oh, I didn't miss that, really.
3759762	3760522	I didn't miss that.
3761139	3761639	Oh, sorry.
3763300	3763960	I didn't miss that.
3764861	3767822	Okay, well then, I guess you really didn't miss anything that good then.
3768222	3770163	Hey, I'm actually kind of glad you called in.
3770423	3773104	I don't know what you called in to talk about, but I got a question for you.
3773424	3774864	Anything new on Night Style?
3774924	3775945	Any new news going on there?
3776325	3778566	I was about to say that, actually.
3778606	3779106	Hooray!
3779686	3780187	We're like-minded.
3780207	3781347	Yeah, we got the latest as of today.
3781927	3782147	Ooh.
3782928	3783988	Yeah.
3784908	3788790	There was a Tokyo demo held yesterday in Japan.
3790191	3793854	This is what they've said so far about a demo of the Night Style.
3795755	3803779	There was no revival song information was revealed because the demo only had 32 songs and no old songs were revealed.
3804400	3806401	Interesting, so they're trying to keep things secret then.
3808412	3810153	Did any word get out about the timing?
3810173	3817596	Because you remember when Night Stalk came out in the arcades, people bitched about the timing issues in it, so I'm wondering how that's going to affect the home version.
3817896	3825259	Well, according to people who went there, the timing seems to be fine, though a few people have mentioned that it seems tighter than previous versions.
3825659	3833122	Whether it was just due to the environment, like the controller, TV positioning, etc., or was an actual timing difference is unknown.
3833769	3834209	Interesting.
3834249	3838951	Yeah, that's true, because if you're playing it at a loud expo, it's probably going to be hard to nail the timing like you usually do.
3840171	3840951	Interesting, though.
3841051	3852094	Hey, I'd be okay with that if they were tightening up the timing windows a little bit, but just... You know how Night Style in the arcade had this whole different feel to it, probably because of rumors that they had changed some hardware and things like that.
3852675	3852935	You know.
3854075	3854615	Interesting.
3854775	3856556	Anything else going on with Night Style that you know of?
3857116	3857196	Um...
3858036	3859817	Random Plus is said to be there.
3860898	3863839	High Speed 4 is there, so if anybody's worried.
3866100	3871684	Very interesting that we don't know any of the consumer songs yet, considering we're only about, what, two weeks away from release?
3872704	3875706	We don't really know a whole lot about those consumer tracks, hopefully.
3876306	3881749	Speaking of consumer tracks, there are five CS-exclusive songs that have been released recently.
3884490	3889112	Here they are, the genre, and I'll mention the genre, the song, and the artist.
3889172	3890372	Oh, so these are for Night Style?
3890932	3891152	Yeah.
3891313	3892013	Oh, cool, okay.
3892933	3896875	The genre here is Dance Pop, and it's Usual Days Remix by Otatu.
3897195	3897475	Okay.
3898035	3901837	It's 4-star on Light 7, 7-star on 7 Keys.
3902377	3902757	Okay.
3903537	3907399	And then Ragged Jungle, 5PM Eternal by Garoovee, featuring Nochiin.
3908566	3912088	5 Star on Light 7, Flashing 7 on 7 Keys.
3912269	3914390	Is that LED and Groovy or just Groovy?
3914850	3915531	Just Groovy.
3915571	3916291	Interesting, okay.
3917212	3923756	And then the genre is Discotheque, 80s Capsule by Megumi Upper Slope, 3 Star on Light 7, 4 Star on 7 Keys.
3924356	3925077	Hmm, okay.
3926117	3932722	Club Jazz, Paramnesia by Ushiroda Shinji, 4 Star on Light 7, 6 Star on 7 Keys.
3933002	3933342	Alright.
3933802	3934743	And then the fifth song...
3935410	3942975	Which, you know, genre is drum and bass Photogenic by LED featuring Horisawa Maiko
3944542	3946943	Six Star and Light Seven, Seven Star and Seven Keys.
3946963	3950124	Those are the only five songs that have been announced so far.
3950164	3951244	So there are two more.
3952465	3954665	That's more than I knew about already, so that's cool.
3954766	3958527	So that's good that LED's going to have one in there, because I always like his stuff.
3958567	3962328	Even though it all kind of sounds similar, I'm excited to see that's going to be there.
3962368	3970771	Let me send you this link on the website, which is actually a screenshot of the menu select interface of 2DX Nightstyle.
3970871	3971491	Oh, very cool.
3971551	3976834	So that's you posting in the chatroom there as DarkLionXVI for those that want to click on that link.
3977415	3978095	Alright, very cool.
3979856	3981857	I'm pulling it up here on my end here on the computer.
3981997	3984559	Ah, okay.
3985379	3989601	Okay, it pretty much looks like the arcade did a little bit, a little bit condensed down, but I like that.
3990162	3990622	It's a good look.
3991970	3993451	I just like Night Style a whole bunch.
3993971	3996914	So it's going to be the one that gets me back into 2DX.
3997194	4000477	And I know I said that about 7th and 8th and it didn't work, but Night Style will be the one.
4000817	4001058	It will.
4002819	4006222	In case you notice on the picture that there are clear lamps are in there.
4007924	4009805	You know, like the colored markers.
4010326	4012488	Yeah, you got this song finished.
4012508	4012688	Good.
4012808	4013048	Right on.
4017509	4018349	Alright, anything else?
4019230	4019710	Oh, yeah?
4020850	4026733	On 9thStyleCS, for those who have played it, Quasar was supposed to have the 10thStyle video in it.
4027293	4027934	Oh, cool.
4029574	4030435	Alright, right on.
4030455	4033316	Because you know how Quasar didn't really have, like, it had a generic video on 9thStyle.
4033336	4035057	Yeah, it's a generic video from the background.
4035417	4035777	Oh, good.
4036057	4037378	I hope they do give a 10thStyle video.
4037678	4042140	I hope that we get a 10thStyle or a Red song in there that crosses over as well.
4042160	4045301	That'd be kind of nice, but I guess we don't know anything yet, huh?
4046445	4054654	No, so... Yeah, they still have the folder sorting, you know, like by folders, like by letter, by the level of the difficulty of the song.
4054714	4054994	Right.
4055395	4058918	They have it, or supposedly have it in there.
4059078	4059379	Cool.
4060006	4066368	Well, I'm sure the next two weeks will be busy two weeks for Night Style News, so hopefully we'll have more stuff next week and the week after, of course.
4067169	4068589	Thank you, as always, for the update, Siggy.
4069129	4069329	Yeah.
4069349	4070510	Anything else you want to share with the listeners?
4071630	4072811	Well, nothing much to say.
4073651	4073971	All right.
4074611	4074912	Fair enough.
4074932	4076892	Well, thanks for calling in and giving us this update.
4077472	4077733	All right.
4077853	4078293	Have a good one.
4078873	4079073	Later.
4079353	4079593	Later.
4080514	4081154	All right, let's go.
4081174	4086176	Wow, a bunch of people hammering us trying to get in tonight, so we'll just kind of take the calls as we see them.
4086256	4087096	Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.
4088035	4089295	Hey Sky, it's El Mullet.
4089335	4090976	Hello my friend, how are you?
4091636	4093036	I'm doing good, how about yourself?
4093157	4095677	I'm pretty good, I'm actually kind of glad you called in.
4096618	4097538	Really, how so?
4097658	4099638	I have a bone to pick with Inside Pulse.
4100519	4101139	Oh, now what?
4102139	4104640	I was reading the review of Tekken 5 over there.
4105000	4107101	Oh, for crying out loud, not this.
4107981	4114883	And the guy was totally dogging on the music, and I'm like, oh my gosh, Tekken 5 has great music in it, I think.
4116133	4117795	That would be his opinion.
4118016	4118496	I know.
4118636	4119738	I know it wasn't you.
4119978	4121260	It's all about the moonlight stage.
4121780	4126446	But since you're the closest thing I have to being able to yell at Inside Pulse, I'm yelling at you.
4128689	4134490	Well, there always is the email link to the person who wrote the review.
4134610	4137711	I'm sure he would like another flame to add to his collection.
4137831	4140471	I don't want to flame this guy via email.
4140551	4142632	I'd rather he call in so I can yell at him in person.
4143532	4144212	That's all right.
4144932	4147973	What are you supposed to say when you argue about somebody with music?
4148353	4152454	Arguing with people about music is something I never understood because it's like, this song sucks.
4152954	4153515	No, it doesn't.
4153575	4154055	Yes, it does.
4154135	4154555	No, it doesn't.
4154756	4163002	I mean, what can you, how can you say, you know, people's perception of music, it is totally and purely opinion, really.
4163302	4165484	You know, what sounds good to me may not sound good to you, you know.
4165684	4167385	Yeah, I completely agree with you there, Sky.
4167425	4173049	It's like, but if we don't have arguments about music, we wouldn't have any song pack discussion.
4173269	4176452	But one thing we can all agree on is that Forever Sunshine sucks balls.
4176972	4179235	Now, I can't agree with you there.
4179435	4182699	I cannot agree with you that it sucks balls.
4182839	4186944	I can tolerate it and enjoy it when I'm in the right mood.
4187404	4191149	I will take forever sunshine on this song pack.
4191729	4192150	I don't
4192850	4194811	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
4220649	4224752	That needs to be played on every episode of Orange Lounge from here to eternity.
4224832	4226493	It's going to be the new inside joke.
4226533	4226833	Just wait.
4226853	4228114	It's going to be the new cake pie.
4229795	4230296	Just wait.
4230396	4232537	Anyway, so to what do we owe the call?
4232617	4236700	I got you sidetracked there because I wanted to yell at you, but to what do we owe this call tonight, El Mullet?
4237441	4241184	Well, we owe this call to, well, song pack discussion.
4241204	4247729	I find it just very interesting to see everybody's dog in Forever Sunshine, whether you like it or not.
4248350	4253294	Everyone's dog in it, and it's like, oh, now this song pack's going to suck because Forever Sunshine's in it.
4253374	4259939	Okay, well, a song pack doesn't suck if one bad song is in it, because one good song can make a song pack very good, too.
4260559	4261660	Exactly, exactly.
4261820	4263461	And that's what I'm trying to get across.
4263822	4268545	There are people out there who have labeled the song pack as bad thanks to one song.
4268605	4270307	Worst song pack ever!
4271347	4279393	Yes, people labeled song pack 3 bad because as soon as they heard Dynamite Rave was going to be on it before it was even released, Oh no, it's Dynamite Rave!
4279473	4280794	Everyone's played it already!
4280874	4281475	Go away!
4284198	4286262	That's true, and I was one of those people.
4286362	4289928	But at the same time, there were things on Sompac 3 that I was looking forward to.
4290249	4292533	And to be honest, it's not a big surprise either.
4292613	4296180	Like, you know, way back in the day when USA Mix was all there was.
4296570	4297631	DarkSakura, you remember this.
4297891	4300813	How many people would play Dynamite Rave at Golf Land?
4301173	4301874	Everyone.
4302454	4303815	Exactly, exactly.
4305216	4307378	But I'm personally looking forward to this song pack.
4307418	4309940	I'm definitely looking forward to the new songs.
4310400	4312181	Jelly Kiss, most definitely.
4312281	4319606	I put together a list a long, long, long time ago that I never released to anybody of what songs I'd like to see on song packs.
4320527	4326294	I put down 19 November, that ended up being on the mix, and Jelly Kiss was the only one so far that actually made it.
4326394	4327896	You got a Santa thing going on there?
4328216	4328677	Or Sana?
4328717	4328977	Sana?
4329478	4330159	I like Sana.
4330359	4332221	Sana's a good group.
4332482	4334144	I totally just did the white boy pronunciation.
4334184	4334504	Santa?
4335145	4336606	Um, anyway.
4337307	4337908	Santa.
4338048	4338449	Santa.
4340057	4342618	That Santa Moleste song, what is that about?
4344118	4344998	That's pervy.
4345858	4352140	That's pervy, just wait until Jelly Kiss comes out.
4352860	4358281	I'm just glad that Ultramix 2 kind of lives on this way through these songpacks still coming out.
4358521	4364862	Although I am a little upset that it took so darn long to start getting these songpacks to roll out regularly because there was that hold up with the whole Canadian thing.
4365582	4369203	I'm glad to see the songpacks coming and keeping Ultramix 2 going.
4369847	4370587	Yeah, that's fine.
4370627	4376431	I mean, it was all Microsoft's fault here, and as soon as SP8 came out, I'm sure people were dancing in the streets.
4376731	4379973	Well, if they were fanboys enough to do so.
4381254	4383515	You know, I was actually playing Ultramix 2 online today.
4383535	4384255	It was kind of interesting.
4384295	4390619	I was actually playing another Xbox game, and I got an invite over to Ultramix 2 from somebody who is...
4391159	4396401	I think she's the number one Ultramix player and she's like in the top five of Ultramix 2.
4397241	4398382	And she's really, really good.
4398742	4402263	So she sent me a challenge thing because, you know, we have fun when we play on there.
4403263	4405344	So I actually played against her and it was cool.
4405384	4407585	We were just going down the list alphabetically.
4407965	4412187	And it was just, you know, we were just going down the list alphabetically and there's so many good songs in Ultramix 2.
4412247	4414708	It's just, I do love that mix.
4414748	4415588	I wish I'd played it more.
4416323	4417684	It makes me excited for Ultramix 3.
4418344	4421846	And I know nothing official has been announced with Ultramix 3, but come on.
4422286	4423467	There's got to be an Ultramix 3.
4424188	4433693	You know what else, speaking of Ultramix, I was actually at Best Buy yesterday, and I was looking for a new game to pick up, and I noticed that DDR Ultramix was in Xbox Platinum Hits now.
4434475	4434955	Oh, really?
4434975	4436136	Yeah, I saw that the other day.
4436216	4437456	I didn't even realize that.
4437596	4438897	Like, that totally came out of nowhere.
4439297	4442078	So, has that been that way for a long time?
4442418	4443339	I think it's more recent.
4443439	4444099	Is it more recent?
4444159	4447700	Well, just so you guys know, Ultramix is only $20 now because it's a Platinum hit.
4448020	4453482	So you can get the Platinum hits cover, too, because the cover looks a little different when you're Platinum hits games.
4453502	4454283	That was kind of neat to see.
4455017	4458799	Yeah, so we can now say, no matter what you think of the first Ultramix, guess what?
4458859	4459999	It was successful enough.
4460199	4460699	That's right.
4460759	4464521	And Ultramix 2 is probably destined for the Platinum hits soon enough as well.
4464601	4465381	So that's pretty exciting.
4465401	4468703	If Ultramix 1 can make it, then Ultramix 2 should be Platinum by the end of the year.
4468843	4469383	Absolutely.
4469683	4470744	Although, you know, it was interesting.
4470804	4474965	I've been really into this website lately for video games.
4475045	4476166	It's 1up.com.
4476326	4477346	I don't know if you guys have heard of this.
4477546	4478007	1up.com.
4478807	4483509	Because they have a lot of the... It's very fan-oriented where you can have your own blogger and you can have a club.
4483820	4488381	We actually have an Orange Lounge Radio Club over on 1UP.com that Rice Princess started.
4488401	4490802	So I'll have to put the link in the chatroom for that for those guys who haven't seen it yet.
4491262	4492022	The Orange Lounge Radio Club.
4494123	4496483	They also show how games are ranked.
4497183	4498864	Like, you know, the ranking for various games.
4499264	4506826	And I was surprised because I have in every Xbox title that I own and Ultramix 2 was like the lowest ranked one on the list.
4506906	4509606	And I was kind of like, that's so sad because it's such a great game.
4510727	4512047	It's really a gem of a title.
4513061	4520104	It is, but then again, you know, a place like that, when fans come to congregate, it's going to be a lot of the casual fans.
4520424	4527088	And, of course, games like Halo and Gran Turismo and Grand Theft Auto and Metal Gear, they're all going to be in the top ranks.
4527108	4527628	Well, exactly.
4527648	4536972	If you look at the top three right now, it's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Halo 2, and The Legend of Zelda, the brand new one, because of that, you know, trailer that came out this week.
4536992	4537933	The Legend of Zelda shocked me, but...
4539253	4540594	I saw that.
4541214	4542315	That was a very good trailer.
4542335	4544136	Yeah, remember the trailer that came out this week.
4544176	4544516	Oh my God.
4544536	4546137	How many of you guys saw the Zelda trailer this week?
4547178	4547718	I haven't yet.
4548079	4549059	I'm going to show it to you.
4549079	4549540	I've been busy.
4549860	4551221	After the show tonight, I have to show it to you.
4552621	4555883	It will just make you tingle in places you didn't know could tingle.
4557064	4559626	Two words can describe the trailer.
4560026	4561707	Holy and what's the other one?
4561747	4562227	Yeah, crap.
4562267	4562788	Holy crap.
4563789	4566751	or other various explicitives that you might be able to get.
4567151	4567432	Oh, of course.
4567552	4571494	Including the omission of bodily functions that I think I'll just stop there on.
4572375	4572955	What, DarkSakura?
4573055	4573976	Explicitives?
4574516	4575677	Don't you mean expletives?
4575697	4576438	Yeah, expletives.
4578419	4580280	I'm going to add that to the dictionary of Rob.
4582540	4588262	This is why I'm on internet radio, boys and girls, because, you know, these things, I can't get into real radio.
4588282	4590603	I can never break into real radio because of my pronunciation problems.
4591003	4599186	Yes, that was a new song by Britney Spears that was toxic here on... You put the wrong emphasis on the wrong syllables, guy.
4599646	4600487	You need to work on that.
4603187	4604128	Oh, well, I'm learning.
4604268	4604628	All right.
4605048	4607229	Anything else you want to share with us, El Mullet?
4608703	4615965	Well, if you see a piece a little down the line on In The Groove on our site, I'll be responsible for that.
4616685	4617946	Ooh, I can't wait to see that.
4618326	4619726	That's all I'm going to say on it.
4619806	4622387	Knowing that you wrote it makes me very excited.
4623107	4626368	What it is and in what capacity, I'm not at liberty to say at this point.
4626508	4626808	All right.
4628148	4628468	All right.
4628869	4629329	Sounds good.
4629929	4630549	I'll be looking for it.
4631129	4631869	Talk to you later, Sky.
4631909	4632630	Have a good one, Mullet.
4633130	4633430	You too.
4633570	4633790	Later.
4634741	4635882	Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.
4635942	4636522	How you guys doing?
4636542	4637162	I'm doing pretty good.
4637182	4638443	Glad to hear you guys one more time.
4638463	4638623	Not much.
4638643	4642265	I've been telling DarkSakura for a while I had a little surprise for her.
4642305	4643866	I'm posting the links now in the chat room.
4661484	4662845	I'm going to bring them up on the computer over here.
4663105	4665706	You can get them on your laptop over there, right, DarkSakura?
4665726	4666407	Okay, I'm looking.
4666947	4668688	Okay, I'm putting them in, too, because I want to see what it is.
4668708	4673870	So DJ Ranma S is posting this in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, clicking on chat.
4674631	4675691	Oh, is that a picture of you, buddy?
4676832	4680173	And you're kicking an old arcade machine.
4682594	4684315	That's awesome.
4685056	4687977	If you don't mind, we want to put that in our Orange Lounge Radio photo gallery.
4688601	4689142	Go right ahead.
4689162	4689762	That is rad.
4689842	4695668	I think we need to start a photo gallery on OrangeLoungeRadio.com of people kicking Ultracade machines.
4696529	4697329	I like that idea.
4698490	4699111	We're going to do that.
4699171	4701433	We'll even set up an email where you can email your picks.
4701593	4702414	That is awesome.
4702494	4704816	And you'll be the first one in there, buddy.
4705217	4705817	That's great.
4705857	4706438	Hey, no fair.
4706478	4707699	You have an Alpine Racer 2.
4708059	4708880	I miss that game.
4709901	4712804	Well, if you ever come to New York, I'll bring it to the arcade where you can play it.
4713686	4714346	Sounds good.
4714366	4715587	Can I have that plane ticket, please?
4715607	4719009	You know, actually, that arcade reminds me of Miggle, kind of, for some reason.
4719049	4719789	I don't know what it is.
4720530	4720890	Interesting.
4720910	4726413	And there's another... So there's a picture of him kicking the top and a picture of him kicking the coin slot.
4726613	4726973	Awesome.
4727374	4728074	That is so rad.
4728134	4732777	I was trying to go for a better kick, but manager came by.
4732817	4736018	We just kind of hightailed out of there.
4736519	4742382	Now, everybody out there, before I encourage you to run out there and kick all the Ultra Kade machines in the planet...
4743012	4744233	Be careful, okay?
4744973	4748436	Don't actually damage the machine because you can get in trouble for that.
4748456	4753479	And I don't want to get sued because somebody, you know, we had recommended that you kick an Ultracade machine.
4753899	4759924	If you get in trouble for kicking an Ultracade machine, I will say that I knew nothing about it.
4760044	4761445	And we never told you to do anything.
4761565	4762585	So don't get in trouble.
4763486	4763886	There you go.
4763906	4765187	You got the disclaimer up and running.
4765267	4765567	All right.
4765627	4766108	Sounds good.
4766288	4767268	Anything else you wanted to share with us?
4767309	4767949	That's great, though.
4768775	4772256	One more thing, I went out and bought a Donald J. Trump doll Friday night.
4775456	4776557	Only in New York.
4777497	4778337	What is this about?
4778777	4780758	What made you decide to get a Donald J. Trump doll?
4781498	4788019	Well, me and my friends, we went out for dinner, and before we decided to play DDR, there's a big Toys R Us in Times Square.
4788539	4792320	We went over, walked around, we found some great stuff.
4792400	4795801	There's a picture in my gallery of Toys R Us misspelling Gundam with an H.
4797972	4801216	Isn't that Toys R Us, the one that was in an episode of The Apprentice as well?
4801857	4802277	Yes.
4802317	4802918	Okay, okay.
4802978	4804120	So it's a famous Toys R Us.
4804620	4804881	Mm-hmm.
4805682	4805962	All right.
4807003	4810307	Basically, we got dragged over to the Barbie section.
4810327	4811168	We're walking around.
4811229	4813071	One of the guys was like, check this out.
4813231	4815634	He picked up the doll, and I was like, I bought it.
4816184	4820285	It's a picture of me in the gallery worshipping the doll because it was like the best thing in the Barbie section.
4821165	4823746	Wait, so they had the Donald Trump doll in the Barbie section?
4823986	4824326	Yes.
4824766	4825606	What is that all about?
4825646	4826346	That's very interesting.
4826386	4826806	I don't know.
4827686	4830267	But it does have this one interesting quote.
4830287	4831287	I hope you guys can hear it.
4831547	4831867	Okay.
4835508	4836288	No, I couldn't hear it.
4836328	4836948	What was it saying?
4837848	4840189	I have no choice to tell you, but you're fired.
4840349	4841729	Oh, beautiful.
4841809	4845230	And to answer the question in the chat room, that is Laser Park in New York City.
4845783	4846724	Oh, okay, very cool.
4846864	4847304	Yeah.
4847825	4855431	All right, well, Ranma, thank you very much for the pictures, and I think you've started a new trend here on Orange Lounge, so we're going to get on that after tonight's show, doing the Ultracade Kicking Gallery.
4856212	4857833	Well, I'm here to help any way possible.
4857953	4860075	All right, so get your friends to do it and take pictures of them.
4861056	4861636	I plan on it.
4861676	4862437	All right, sounds good.
4863858	4864419	All right, cool.
4864499	4865199	All right, have a good one, buddy.
4865219	4866020	We've got to get some more calls.
4866540	4867201	All right, take care.
4867221	4867461	Bye.
4867521	4867842	Later.
4868822	4871785	All right, one more call, you guys, and we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.
4872065	4873046	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
4876084	4879165	Legend of Zaku.
4880766	4882306	Well, a couple of things.
4882646	4889448	One, let me see, a tournament I went to this weekend and just basically drama, drama, and damage and drama.
4889468	4892789	It was a local tournament in the Bronx, you know, where I'm from.
4892809	4893249	And apparently...
4898720	4906925	The locals in the arcade there basically got pissed off at, you know, the people out, you know, the outside players for basically being good at them.
4907185	4909506	I mean, beating the crap out of them in, you know, the tournament.
4910106	4915109	And they got so childish that they brought like six or seven people that, you know, they were about to beat the shit out of them.
4915990	4927036	That's how bad... Well, you're breaking up a little bit there, buddy, but... Right now, you'll see the locked thread that resulted in this.
4927822	4934465	So, you're breaking up a little bit, but clarify this for me.
4936346	4937747	I think he might be a little bit delayed here.
4937887	4938887	So, clarify this for me.
4941008	4944410	Some folks beat some other folks up over DDR, is what you're saying.
4948332	4948992	I think he's delayed.
4949172	4950833	Oh, okay, okay.
4951173	4954655	Because, you know, these people, the people here...
4955928	4957669	He's really breaking up there.
4957729	4961051	You're really, really breaking up there, buddy.
4961772	4963353	They take DDR too seriously.
4964954	4966255	Yeah, I mean, you know what?
4966355	4968536	They take DDR too seriously.
4968936	4973339	DDR is nothing to want to even think about beating somebody up over.
4973659	4978022	I mean, I would say that serving people over a DDR tournament, that's okay.
4978082	4980644	You can serve people, but don't beat them up.
4981004	4982465	Yes, but they take...
4983203	4989704	No, but the thing is that they took it seriously as they compared, they almost made it, you know, compared it as to like a sporting event.
4990445	4996526	Well, they were just basically, you know, distracting, embarrassing the other players and not the regulars there.
4997146	4999407	So it's kind of like, that's where the drama erupted from.
5000027	5005808	And, you know, the regular good players had to like, you know, show them their place by basically showing off in order to show them how it felt like.
5006008	5010109	You know what, all I have to say... They basically ignored it, you know, in the past couple of tournaments there...
5010657	5010817	Exactly.
5010837	5011018	Exactly.
5020385	5034075	As you can see the post from DDR Freak that I gave you, Sketch, you know, who's basically almost like a household name within the community because, you know, he's one of the best in the city, if not the state or the east coast.
5034755	5040959	He was there in attendance yesterday and he pointed out, he basically, he told them politely that he just, you know, he finds those people rude.
5042000	5046063	And, you know, they basically went on rampage by insulting his group.
5046960	5048923	Thank you for watching!
5057048	5057248	All right.
5057828	5066130	Buddy, you're... My friend, you're breaking up over there, so I'm gonna... Zaku, I know you're still trying to talk, but we can't understand you because you're breaking up, buddy.
5066230	5070031	I'm gonna have to go ahead and let you go, but we'll talk a little bit more about this, so keep listening, Zaku.
5070051	5071932	I appreciate the update on the tournament, okay, bud?
5072272	5073432	Have a good one.
5073772	5076313	I feel bad that I had to let him go, but he was just breaking up really bad there.
5077473	5081314	So... I don't know.
5081474	5082974	Why would you want to do this?
5084014	5086415	Obviously, if you go to a DDR tournament...
5087356	5096763	It is going to be a... And I explicit, by the way, walked in during that phone call, so he's kind of picked up most of that call, and he's run a lot of tournaments and has had to deal with some of this drama.
5096983	5098984	So I know you've got something you want to share on this.
5099445	5106590	But if you go to a DDR tournament, you should expect that there are going to be people there who are better than you.
5107190	5110292	So why would you want to beat them up because they're better than you?
5110853	5114916	Well, the thing is, I understand this is a human nature that people do not want to lose.
5115880	5120364	or people looking out over some other dude's girlfriend or so forth.
5120464	5136696	It's a lot of nonsense, but I mean, I've been through numerous tournaments myself, maybe like 18 tournaments so far total, and never have I seen anybody fight physically in a tournament, but if this were true...
5137924	5140305	I just had to tell people that just grow up, basically.
5140325	5142226	They didn't actually do the physical fight.
5142246	5143027	I clarified that.
5143047	5145548	They didn't actually get into a fight, but, you know, get in there.
5145728	5147449	Get in there.
5148390	5151531	I remember there was one time that I saw a fight over DER.
5151731	5152672	Oh, my gosh.
5153252	5155313	That was the CCO like two years ago in July.
5155333	5156314	That's so lame.
5156334	5157454	That's so lame.
5159515	5161596	And what was the honest reason?
5162257	5165118	Oh, my God, you got one more perfect than me, bastard.
5165719	5166219	Oh, because...
5166877	5175243	Well, the thing is, at the time I was there, well, the person who was playing, like, Demon Road got to Max Unlimited.
5175943	5181367	Then some guy was just, you know, messing around, thinking it would be okay to screw his game up.
5181627	5182047	Gotcha.
5182567	5182808	Yeah.
5182868	5183888	Then, of course, the fight.
5184068	5186970	Spilled coke over the DDR pads in the group.
5187471	5188972	Well, now the in-the-group pads.
5189112	5189332	Right.
5189812	5190713	That was two years ago, so.
5190753	5190993	Horrible.
5192134	5192434	Horrible.
5193470	5197373	All right, well, you guys that are going to DDR tournaments, don't start drama.
5197794	5200776	You give the rest of us a bad name, and we will find you and beat you up.
5200796	5202618	I set your ass on fire.
5202638	5203899	Oh, your mic's off there, I think.
5204740	5207142	You start drama, I set your ass on fire.
5207262	5207762	There you go.
5207802	5211185	So you can start drama if you want to die.
5212406	5212987	That'd be cool.
5213447	5215229	I need an excuse to set people on fire, you know.
5215629	5216089	Well said.
5216330	5217130	You like the fire.
5217511	5217971	I know that.
5218792	5219112	All right.
5219721	5222303	We're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match now, you guys.
5222323	5224944	Those of you guys that didn't get through on the Skype line, try again a little later.
5224984	5227005	We'll hopefully open that up again a little bit later.
5227646	5228666	After Listless as well.
5228686	5231448	I'll have to fill you in on tonight's Listless topic because we're going to do that.
5231468	5231848	Oh, okay.
5232068	5232369	All right.
5233229	5235410	And your DS is here as well.
5235430	5235771	Yes, I know.
5235791	5236551	I forgot.
5237312	5239873	Make sure it's yours because there's like three of them around here somewhere.
5239893	5241614	It says explicit with three X's.
5241694	5242034	Gotcha.
5242094	5242395	Okay.
5242735	5247498	You know, you're in just under the 30-day rule because if something's here for 30 days, we keep it.
5248919	5250101	Don't worry about it.
5250381	5252323	I have PM to Loki.
5253004	5253505	I know, I know.
5253545	5253985	It's all good.
5254346	5254626	All right.
5255127	5257670	We're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match right now.
5259653	5263094	The way the cage match works, you've got to be in our chat room to play.
5263374	5266114	www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.
5266535	5269495	And the way the cage match works, we play three songs for you guys.
5270735	5276317	Last week's winner, we play a clip of that song, and then we play two new songs for you guys, okay?
5276677	5286719	So we're going to do that, and you guys are going to vote on your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program.
5287319	5295441	Last week in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match, Ayumi Hamasaki was the winner with a System F remix of a song called Kanaria.
5295461	5298081	Okay, so that's the song that DarkSakura picked.
5298441	5300882	Yeah, sounds like Gonorrhea, but it's Kanaria.
5302462	5306123	Alright, but it's actually, this song is much, much better than Gonorrhea could ever be.
5306223	5307263	So we're going to get into that.
5308364	5310264	Here it is, a clip of song number one.
5310304	5312484	You only get to hear a clip because it was last week's winner.
5312504	5315025	So here it is, a clip, Ayumi Hamasaki, song number one.
5352060	5353286	Thank you for watching!
5420134	5421914	Alright, that was a clip of song number one.
5422095	5424395	You can vote for it tonight, Ayumi Hamasaki.
5424495	5426536	Song number two is Loki's pick.
5426596	5427876	Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
5428416	5429256	That's another song.
5429316	5431977	It's a remix of Xenon.
5432337	5435298	It's Xenon the halogen mix and it's done by G-Drop.
5436498	5439599	I found it on some video game mix site or something.
5441080	5442320	Alright, so here it is.
5442520	5446021	A remix of Xenon is song number two tonight in the cage match.
5446081	5446381	Enjoy.
5454497	5455278	Thanks for watching!
5463021	5464983	Thank you for watching!
5544310	5545571	Thanks for watching!
5570192	5571533	Thank you for watching!
5641549	5642470	Thanks for watching!
5729154	5734278	All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Beat Drop with Xenon, the Halogen Mix.
5734698	5741523	And now we're going to go around in our really bad impersonation of American Idol and tell you guys what we thought of that, although we're not the ones who get to choose.
5741603	5742764	It's you guys in the chat room.
5743084	5743665	DarkSakura.
5744305	5749449	It sounded like someone took Xenon, which was by itself a really good song, and dropped it and beat it.
5750290	5751191	Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
5752427	5753668	I didn't like the sampling at all.
5753788	5758292	Sounded like it was done through a telephone or a Game Boy.
5760373	5771123	There were parts of it I thought were okay, but honestly I just couldn't get past it sounding like it was done through like a phonograph speaker underwater.
5772003	5772804	So it gets a two.
5774205	5774746	Explicit.
5776519	5790831	Well, it's a pretty good song, I mean, there's some, like DarkSakura said, there's some parts I just don't feel would be necessary, which is like, I'll give it a 6, but since it's not a Max Remix, I'll give it, I'll give it a plus 1 point, a 7.
5792192	5797776	Angel It was okay, I still like the original better, 6.5 Loki
5801494	5801634	Me,
5831095	5831796	Hated it.
5832056	5832296	Three.
5833036	5837099	Oh, but I'm going to give it a bonus point for not being a Max Remix as well, so it gets a four.
5838500	5840782	Alright, let's get to my song tonight.
5841362	5847447	My song is actually an old-ass song, but they did, like, this new remix of it last year.
5847867	5851570	So I'm going to pick this song, because this song was rad, and I kind of like this new remix.
5851590	5852450	Like, it really grew on me.
5852490	5853831	I've been listening to it a lot in my car.
5854292	5857474	So, and everybody out here knows this song.
5857534	5858895	It's a group called Hadaway.
5861228	5862869	What is love?
5862949	5879181	Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more
5893131	5895096	What is love?
5930720	5932221	Thank you for watching!
5987638	5988359	DarkSakura.com
6014403	6016306	Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more
6050498	6052659	Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.
6052879	6055821	Hadaway with What Is Love, Reloaded.
6056201	6060223	Let's see what the folks in the room thought of that one, starting off with DarkSakura.
6062224	6066427	I'm sorry, but even remixed, that song still gets on my nerves just because it was so damn overplayed.
6068408	6072810	Where I would give the original a five, that one was slightly better, so I would give it a six and a half.
6073771	6075872	Just because I heard it way too much.
6077153	6077593	Explicit!
6078699	6080260	I have to agree with DarkSakura.
6081141	6082402	Yeah, it's a little overplayed.
6082763	6086546	And this remix, I don't know, it just sounds just the same as the original for some reason.
6087606	6091009	Not really much has been done, just because of the reloaded sign-in to it.
6092430	6092831	I'll give it a 6.8.
6092871	6092831	6.8.
6092911	6096254	Come on, give it an extra .1 so we can have a 6.9 explicit.
6096454	6097515	What do you say?
6102662	6103222	I'll give it the .1.
6103643	6107085	Man, what is this going to have to do?
6107725	6108245	It doesn't matter.
6108265	6109146	Alright, Angel.
6110727	6111267	I liked it.
6113928	6115309	You know, because it's 80s and stuff.
6115329	6115629	I don't know.
6115649	6117971	It kind of had an extra little beat to it.
6119552	6120692	God, this mic is loud.
6120752	6121192	Okay.
6144511	6153255	A new bass, you know, a stronger bass drum and a stronger synth line does not a new... It's just, no.
6154256	6155777	It's not a remix, it's just crap.
6155877	6157517	It's the same damn song all over again.
6157958	6159538	I love the original, and they fucked it up.
6159638	6163680	They went and made it into a Hard House track, and it's not supposed to be.
6164361	6169043	It lost everything I liked about the original, and it just sounds like a really shitty cover of it.
6169543	6170684	So, it gets a 4.
6173363	6180065	Um, you know what, I kind of like it because that song's been kind of gone for a little while now that Night at the Roxbury isn't on Saturday Night Live anymore.
6180606	6184127	Um, you know, so I kind of think it was time for that song to come back.
6184387	6187608	And what I really like about that remix is that it's under three minutes.
6188048	6191729	So whilst the beat in the background is a little repetitive, the song knows when to quit.
6192069	6193230	So I kind of like that.
6193330	6195911	So I like that song, so I will give it an eight.
6196511	6196811	All right.
6197754	6200957	But however, remember, it is not up to us, it's up to you guys.
6201177	6205520	You guys get the final say, so here it is, a reminder of the three songs you get to vote for tonight.
6205901	6208483	Song number one, Ayumi Hamasaki, Kanaria.
6217270	6220753	And song number two you can vote for tonight, Beat Drop with a Zenon Remix.
6229049	6233212	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Hataway, What Is Love, Reloaded.
6242179	6245241	All right, place vote now.
6245361	6253067	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
6253107	6257310	We'll tally them up over the next break and let you guys know the winner very soon.
6258965	6266387	What I've been plugging a little bit tonight, and I'm going to post it one more time in the chat room for those of you guys that haven't had a chance to look at it yet.
6266807	6275309	I'm posting a link to our LiveJournal community, and it's actually a post in that LiveJournal community, and you do not have to be a member of the community to read it.
6275329	6276649	You don't even have to be a LiveJournal member.
6276989	6287512	Just go ahead and click on that link, because what is in that is instructions on how to vote for us in the Best of Live 365 competition that's going on right now, how to get us nominated.
6288092	6289852	and I know what some of you guys are thinking.
6290272	6293573	Why does Orange Lounge Radio want to get nominated for one of those silly award shows?
6294453	6296094	Well, because we like attention.
6296194	6296494	Duh.
6296614	6300074	I mean, DarkSakura, can you disagree with me there?
6300415	6301095	Attention's great.
6302015	6303515	We are whores for attention.
6303575	6304375	Yeah, absolutely.
6304395	6306976	We will totally just make utter sluts of ourselves for attention.
6306996	6311077	Where is the link right there for the Podcast Alley vote thing?
6311337	6312657	Oh, yes, we'll post that as well.
6312677	6313537	I'll post that a little later.
6313577	6317738	I want people to do this first, but we'll do the Podcast Alley thing later because we're trying to get our
6318078	6319099	Thank you for watching!
6338380	6343264	I think really in doing this, because you have to remember there is all sorts of stations on Live365.
6343284	6343744	There's what, like 60,000?
6343864	6348047	It's incredible the amount of stations that are on Live365.
6348748	6355592	And for a DDR talk video game music station to get nominated, that's really cool.
6355612	6365419	And I think it shows that there is an audience for this type of video game programming, where we're not talking about Madden, we're talking about Halo all the time.
6365579	6367741	We're talking about other video games.
6368383	6377209	and you're going to kind of notice that as the year goes on and Orange Lounge kind of slowly does this shift from just being a Bomani to Bomani and more.
6377850	6381513	We just kind of want to show that there is a demand out there for this kind of niche.
6381613	6389038	Speaking of Strictly, if you want to talk a Strictly Bomani-based radio station, our buddies over at DDR Freak, we're trying to help them out get a nomination as well.
6389318	6392601	So they've been really good to us this year, especially with the whole syndication and everything.
6392621	6394183	So we'd like to see them get a nod as well.
6394243	6396865	So that is all detailed for you guys in the live journal post.
6397306	6401369	Also, our grandfather station, Understation Live, we're trying to get them a nod as well.
6401750	6404612	Without Understation Live, we would not be here, I do not think.
6405833	6406213	All of that.
6406453	6408674	So I hope you guys will consider taking a second.
6409014	6409555	It's free.
6409855	6413056	You guys already have to have a Live365 account to listen to this show.
6413136	6414276	So you've already got everything you need.
6414296	6414837	So check that out.
6415677	6420239	Those of you guys that are too shy to join our chat room, just go to our LiveJournal community.
6420299	6424240	It's www.livejournal.com slash community slash orange lounge.
6424260	6427141	And there's a link right there on orangelounge.com that says community.
6427741	6429242	And it's like what, the fourth post down?
6429302	6432023	Just scroll down until you see the best of Live365 post.
6432403	6433984	And we appreciate your support.
6435845	6437145	Okay, so that's that.
6437806	6448491	Let's talk about a little bit of SimScene news, and usually this has kind of been a joke lately with all the sites being down, but I know, Loki, I know there's big news you're very excited about this week, so you've got to tell us about this in the SimScene update.
6449331	6449632	I guess.
6450092	6463939	Anyways, just like a lot of fan stuff out there that's being worked on, most of the stuff, of course, you'll always find is in Japan, and you really need to watch the Japanese sites, because that's where all the stuff's happening nowadays, since all the American stuff's down.
6464821	6471244	And of course, the one site whenever we're talking about Japanese Step Mania, the one thing you have to bring up is Food Mix.
6471505	6475867	And yes, it was announced this week that Food Mix 2 Advanced Edition will be coming out.
6476647	6476887	When?
6476947	6477687	That's a good question.
6477787	6478127	I don't know.
6478167	6480008	But they have a few screenshots up on their site.
6480028	6482308	There's a link on our front page to it.
6482848	6483669	And go check it out.
6483769	6484889	It looks good as ever.
6485489	6486989	And I can't wait.
6488310	6489130	Tons of new stuff.
6489350	6491951	You know they're going to have stuff from diverse systems.
6492791	6495131	It's always a great package once it's put together.
6495591	6496832	Some other things that I might point out.
6497232	6500793	In our forums, in the Orange Lodge Radio, I do have a link to...
6502313	6504234	There's a theme called Pop Candy.
6504614	6507375	The website that had it up originally went down.
6507535	6511216	Luckily, I downloaded it a long-ass time ago, so I hosted it for you guys.
6511596	6514357	You can go download that on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
6514397	6515637	Just check in the forums.
6515777	6516517	You'll find it.
6517477	6522719	And other than that, there was the Siberia theme.
6522979	6529681	2.1 got released, and for those who don't know what that is, that's the Stepmania theme that looks sort of like
6530439	6549632	Techno Fiend, it's the Japanese one, it does look very good, and I've actually switched this to my default theme, I like it a lot, and so definitely check that out as well, other than that, really, there's a whole thread on Belmonte Style, basically it's the fan mix,
6550667	6551267	WatchThread
6581710	6582571	Alright, sounds good.
6583813	6587038	I liked Food Mix a whole heck of a lot, so I'm really excited about Food Mix too.
6587078	6589102	That sounds like a good addition.
6589803	6591005	You know, it's kind of neat because...
6591741	6613669	When you hear all this news about, you know, In the Groove, and Neon FM, and what is that other one, Dance Tracks, or whatever, and all these kind of DDR knockoffs that are spawning from the Sim scene, and you know what, I realize In the Groove is getting a lot of credit now, but let's face it, it started as a Sim scene knockoff game, because it is Step Mania, basically, in a box.
6615249	6617230	It's very interesting to see that Foon Mix...
6618671	6623134	Which I believe to be the king of all this stuff is not an arcade thing.
6623354	6624055	It's interesting.
6624915	6638845	Yeah, if it were ever to make it to the arcade scene, if they actually were to do something similar to what they're doing here within the groove over in Japan with Food Mix, I think it would wipe the floor within the groove.
6638985	6640927	It would simply just topple it.
6641087	6644289	It's just better songs, better everything.
6644389	6645170	Better graphics.
6646368	6651993	It's just so much, so better, you know, done than In The Groove, it's not even funny.
6652393	6653954	It's just, you can't even compare them.
6655115	6656356	Definitely, check it out.
6656716	6662861	If you haven't already downloaded FoonMix 1 and FoonMix Plus, I think you can still do that.
6663842	6672269	Definitely download those, it's a huge download, so if you're on dial-up, probably not going to be able to play that, but if you're not, check it out if you haven't already.
6673959	6679882	I think in our next break, maybe if we can round up some songs, we'll do some Foon Mix music and maybe some other stuff, too.
6680083	6684825	I actually... We haven't played any In the Groove songs in a while, so I think there's actually a couple songs that are worth playing.
6684905	6687387	I know, Jamie's frowning of disapproval.
6688187	6689788	My poor ears.
6690148	6690389	I know.
6691509	6694111	There are some songs I like in In the Groove, so I'm going to play one of those.
6694791	6695111	All right.
6696992	6699054	Let's hear about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?
6699994	6700554	Why not?
6700755	6701435	Why not?
6701715	6702355	All right, so...
6704459	6707660	You guys voted, and there was a pretty clear winner tonight.
6707700	6709640	I've got to say, I was kind of surprised by it.
6710140	6714101	There's a brand new winner tonight, and it's Hadaway.
6715981	6716661	What is love?
6716961	6717441	Reloaded.
6717501	6720202	The chatroom has no taste.
6720322	6720622	You know what?
6720702	6726703	I think they're just nostalgia whores, kind of like I am, because I think when that song started playing, a lot of them were like, I remember this song, I remember that.
6727043	6730964	I remember the scene from... Was it Night of the Roxbury?
6730984	6731884	Yeah, Night of the Roxbury.
6731944	6732104	I think...
6734444	6742946	I don't know, I think that, you know, that song, you heard it a lot, apparently, and that song was pretty damn horrid when that movie was out, but it's been a while, I think most people have forgotten it.
6742966	6752007	There's a station in Mobile, I'll go ahead and name it, it's W-A-B-B, who, when that song came out, it literally played once every 30 minutes.
6753188	6753808	I kid you not.
6753828	6758248	Wow, I would totally listen to a station that played that kind of stuff, that's awesome.
6758288	6760889	Well, they've also played a bunch of crap, because...
6761607	6762287	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
6786796	6786976	Oh.
6787956	6788116	Oh.
6790317	6790837	Oh, stop.
6791837	6792177	All right.
6794618	6795138	Let's see.
6795578	6796178	So we got that.
6796318	6797638	I know what else I wanted to say.
6797678	6801899	I wanted to kind of give a shout-out to one of our buddies.
6802739	6805720	You know her as Rice Princess from Thursday Nights Outside the Box.
6806020	6807680	She goes by a ton of other names, though.
6807780	6809481	Mojiko, Irene.
6810661	6814882	She's a woman of many different names out there, but I'm sure you guys are familiar with her.
6816371	6824175	And I don't usually talk about big commercial gaming sites, but there's one in particular that I've grown quite fond of lately, and that's 1up.com.
6824195	6825595	I actually really like them quite a bit.
6825655	6826336	I would endorse them.
6826356	6827076	They're a great site.
6827456	6829217	We even have our own club over there.
6830298	6832619	I will post the URL to that club in a little bit.
6832659	6837101	I think it's what, like orangeloungeradioclub or something like that, .1up.com.
6837481	6838341	Well, there's a dash in there.
6838361	6839062	Here, I got the link.
6839102	6843324	I'll just post that for you guys in the chat room if you want to join the orangeloungeradioclub.1up.com.
6845111	6845992	Back to Rice Princess.
6846032	6852255	Not only did she start that club on our behalf over there, but she was actually named Blog of the Day.
6852896	6864602	And I don't know if that was today or yesterday, but her 1up.com blog was named Blog of the Day because she made this really big post about the Dear Friends concert that she went to Monday night in San Francisco, and somebody noticed and shared a little love.
6864622	6868264	So we just want to say congratulations to our buddy Rice Princess on being to Blog of the Day.
6868865	6869565	Do you know me?
6869705	6870566	I am so famous.
6873948	6874268	All right.
6877608	6879290	All right, I guess on that note, we're going to go.
6879370	6880391	So we got the cage match winner.
6880431	6880811	We got that.
6880871	6881151	Okay.
6881171	6882332	I guess we're going to go to a break.
6882352	6885575	And when we come back from this break, we'll finally get to that list list we talked about.
6885655	6887276	And the FUs of the week, we still got that as well.
6887576	6888877	Some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time.
6889397	6892280	In this break, some Food Mix and whatever else I can dig up.
6892300	6893160	We'll be back after this.
6893481	6895662	Started off with a little bit of Evergreen from Food Mix.
6895682	6896363	We'll be back after this.
6902007	6902487	Evergreen.
6925600	6930563	Feel the touch of my hands He's the group operator Hypnotized by the look in your eyes Hit the coast
6985174	6985735	Feel you.
7079344	7080165	Thanks for watching!
7167478	7167939	Thank you.
7205847	7206087	Thank you.
7387455	7396078	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
7396118	7401661	Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?
7403615	7405857	Hi guys, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7405897	7410301	Hope you enjoyed that set of mix there from some various sim file scene.
7410901	7413964	I don't know how to kind of loop all that together, but what can you do?
7415585	7417687	Beat Drop, or not Beat Drop, what the hell?
7418047	7419889	That was the song from the Cage Match.
7419969	7427795	Starting us off was Evergreen from Food Mix, then Zodiac from In the Groove, Mirrorball, and P8107 after that, both from Food Mix as well.
7428776	7428856	Um...
7430357	7435624	Loki is obsessed with this new show called Robot Chicken, which I actually watched last Sunday.
7435684	7438547	Actually, I've been watching it every week because I think it's pretty damn funny too.
7439128	7443453	But last Sunday was especially funny because they made fun of Mario Kart.
7443974	7447037	Well, not really made fun, but they totally paid homage to Mario Kart.
7447078	7447878	I'll let Loki explain it.
7447898	7448299	It was awesome.
7449096	7459751	Okay, basically Robot Chicken, for those who don't know, it's this 15 minute long show that's on Cartoon Network, Sundays at 11.30, and I think they also have it repeating throughout the entire week.
7460993	7461874	Yeah, it repeats at
7462335	7471803	Well, I don't know if anyone's going to be awake, but Monday at 2.30 a.m., Fridays at midnight and 3 a.m.
7472563	7473864	So you can check them out then.
7474825	7482251	Their last night's, basically, anyway, so 15-minute show, it's all stop animation with toys and claymation.
7482812	7483772	It's hilarious.
7484133	7487675	Like, for example, week one, we had...
7488846	7499468	They did a parody of, like, the, what was it, the Rachel Lee Cooks public service announcement, you know, where this is your brain on drugs, you know, but it doesn't stop there, you know, this is your family.
7499788	7502808	And she's hitting stuff with, you know, a frying pan, and it's hilarious.
7503509	7509910	I just need to say right now, although it is 1130 right now on the East Coast, that doesn't give you permission to stop listening to us and go watch this.
7510270	7515411	You can download it on BitTorrent later, and also they replay it a ton, so get that.
7515451	7517451	But for you West Coast folks, you'll be able to listen to it.
7518570	7521495	Octimus Prime, Prostate Cancer Awareness
7531907	7536490	And then last week, they did a parody of Cannonball Run.
7536930	7549478	For those who don't remember, Cannonball Run was the Burt Reynolds movie based on the actual cannonball races where you race across the country and it's like a no-holds-barred thing and they have all the weird teams of people and stuff.
7549798	7553420	So they have all these icons from the 80s and stuff.
7553961	7557143	They had Vin Diesel, supposedly, as a character.
7557898	7568222	They had the Ecto-1, Speed Racer, Batman and Robin, the guys from Chips, and just a bunch of other weird people.
7568382	7571804	And Mario, and Luigi, and Wario from Mario Kart.
7572104	7575225	And there's one scene in there where they're actually in the race, and they're all...
7576168	7578869	I think it's time we use the blue tortoiseshell!
7579229	7584510	And so they use the blue tortoiseshell and it hits the guys from... What is it?
7586090	7589031	It just knocks one of the cars off the road and it was hilarious.
7589231	7591031	Honestly, I cannot describe it well enough.
7591211	7596672	You really need to go watch the show tonight to give you a brief preview of what's going to be on.
7597652	7599313	This episode is called The Deep End.
7599353	7604854	It says, find out what happens when seven superheroes are forced to live under one roof in the real world metropolis...
7606755	7607175	Wait a minute.
7607996	7609276	Wasn't this called Drawn Together?
7610937	7612917	Okay, yes, maybe, but this will be better.
7616239	7618860	And then catch Adam James...
7620243	7637869	James T. Kirk, Khan, Noonien Sing, and Kirk Cameron work in a pizza joint in two Kirks, a Khan, and a pizza place.
7639710	7644111	And someone's on a mission to track down Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny in Kill Bunny.
7645171	7649553	And lastly, go backstage for America's favorite undead reality show, Zombie Idol.
7650885	7656027	And what's great about this show is they actually have a lot of the celebrities doing their own voices and stuff.
7656708	7657528	Lots of work.
7657848	7661850	I mean, for example, last week, Luigi, voiced by Matthew Lillard.
7663010	7663951	Great stuff.
7664571	7664931	Awesome.
7665051	7666872	But really, watch the show.
7667412	7669753	If you can't watch it, it's on torrentbox.com.
7671514	7674455	Actually, we have some folks in the chatroom saying, I'm T-voing it right now.
7675470	7678172	And then I'm looking at our live listener stats to us.
7678192	7678833	This is going on.
7678893	7681615	I noticed four people dropped while we were talking about Robot Chicken.
7681975	7682976	So damn you!
7683136	7685098	I told you not to leave to go watch it.
7685378	7685878	Damn you.
7687359	7688080	Stop being cheap.
7688120	7688760	Buy a TiVo.
7689161	7691763	I don't care if this show gets weak in its last hour.
7693164	7693544	All right.
7695205	7702171	Speaking of that weak program you've come to know and love here at Orange Launch Radio, it's time to do tonight's listless segment.
7702271	7703512	Yay!
7703852	7705013	So you know we need some theme music.
7711469	7741032	Alright, tonight's list list everybody is going to be, the topic is Slash commands I would like to see in an MMORPG And of course this topic being spawned by the recent news about Slash Pizza being added into Pizza Hut I'm sorry, being added The newest MMORPG, Pizza Hut, where you play as the delivery person
7742233	7749576	You have to avoid obstacles such as dogs chasing you and throwing newspapers, I mean pizzas into, oh wait, that's Paperboy.
7750476	7751596	Alright, smartass.
7752477	7753497	Don't you know it?
7753757	7756418	My ass is this smart, imagine how smart my brain is.
7756906	7765634	slash pizza being added into EverQuest 2 in a partnership with Pizza Hut so you can order pizza directly from your EverQuest 2 game.
7765974	7769257	So what other slash commands would we like to see in an MMORPG?
7769797	7772660	You guys in the chatroom can submit your suggestions, of course.
7772720	7773460	Just type them up.
7773881	7775842	No guarantees we're going to use them, though, but we'll see.
7776563	7780827	We do have the chatroom displayed on our in-studio television screen where everybody can see it.
7781367	7788315	Tonight on Listless, participating, we have DarkSakura, Loki, myself, and Angel and Explicit are working as one team tonight.
7788395	7789136	They're one mind.
7789716	7790918	Or no, not anymore?
7791558	7791699	Oh!
7792640	7794281	They are two separate entities now.
7794342	7798206	They have, uh, they have, I know, that's very, that does sound kind of wrong.
7798526	7798846	All right.
7799327	7800108	But really funny.
7801670	7802030	All right.
7803737	7804198	Let's find this.
7804238	7805580	Alright, I'm going to kill the background music.
7805600	7806401	We'll bring it back later.
7806481	7808063	Remember, you guys get to vote.
7808484	7810166	You guys get to vote on the top three.
7810226	7811568	We're only creating the list.
7811888	7815173	So what's going to happen is we're each going to read off our top three.
7815733	7816795	And then the fun part.
7817275	7820520	Each one of us gets to take one off of the list.
7821274	7826257	DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your number three pick for a slash command you'd like to see in an MMORPG?
7851081	7852623	My first one is slash window.
7853583	7854905	And what does slash window do?
7855285	7868918	It opens up like a little PIP window where you can like, you know, like if you instead of, because, you know, obviously they're not going to actually window Final Fantasy XI without using something that they consider illegal.
7870199	7875604	You know, you should be able to access like the play online site as a window in window.
7876005	7876385	Wait a minute.
7877304	7880266	You've actually come up with a practical, good idea.
7880766	7881506	But it's not funny.
7882327	7883087	I'm just kidding.
7883107	7883908	My other ones are funny.
7883988	7884828	It doesn't have to be funny.
7884848	7890031	But I was really annoyed, because usually I have to set up my laptop to use a fake use-to-play.
7891892	7893573	I'm just loving our chatroom right now.
7893813	7896374	You guys, seriously, if you haven't looked at what the chatroom is... Slash all your base.
7897135	7899036	I like slash girls' butts.
7900656	7901797	Sega Dreamcast.
7902097	7902377	Alright.
7902718	7903258	No, they need to...
7904412	7910496	Even though I would put, I would have, this would have been like my number four, would have been like slash PSO mode.
7910876	7911156	Uh-huh.
7911876	7913858	Where you just walk, run around from room to room.
7913878	7915218	All right.
7915719	7916219	Let's see.
7916599	7917159	Let's go on.
7917239	7918680	Explicit, your number three, please.
7918700	7921402	Slash yo mama.
7921462	7921822	Wait, wait.
7921842	7923003	Do you have a microphone over there, buddy?
7923343	7923923	Yeah.
7923983	7924664	Sorry, listeners in here.
7924684	7925424	All right.
7926645	7927465	Slash yo mama.
7927846	7928866	Slash yo mama.
7928946	7930207	And what does slash yo mama do?
7931274	7933835	You know, they're all saying, ooh, I fucked your mom and stuff.
7934295	7936656	So slash yo mama would actually fuck your mama?
7937597	7937837	Yeah.
7940818	7941018	Ouch.
7941278	7942279	I feel sorry for yo mama.
7943039	7943819	Angel, you're number three.
7948902	7950042	Slash silly string.
7951183	7952323	Slash silly string.
7952363	7953964	And what would slash silly string do?
7955224	7960867	Enable you with the silly string, kid, so you could, like, have a silly string fight with the rest of your party.
7962592	7964013	Oh my, let's get messy!
7964433	7966073	All right, Loki, you're number three.
7971456	7973617	Slash Nicole Brown Simpson.
7978359	7981620	And I think we know.
7982160	7985101	This would, yeah.
7986922	7990924	This would link you to the Find the Real Killers website out there.
7992577	7999525	Yeah, because they're out there and loose and OG Simpson is searching for them in every golf course.
8002008	8002288	Wow.
8003269	8004171	Wow, wow, wow.
8005432	8007835	My number three needs a little bit of explaining.
8007935	8011259	My number three choice is Slash Abshock.
8012403	8013504	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
8035290	8035750	Yeah, right.
8035950	8036590	No, not really.
8036750	8039391	No, they're anorexic from having the lack of slash pizza.
8040531	8040891	All right.
8042072	8042572	Let's see.
8042772	8044032	DarkSakura, you're number two.
8045793	8046793	Let me pull up the file again.
8048614	8049454	I love my laptop.
8051054	8051774	Slash sim.
8053335	8056656	What that does is it creates a simulacrum of yourself to go to your job.
8059156	8060637	Like the Calvin clone machine.
8061177	8061517	Wow.
8062367	8063387	Someday, I hope.
8063508	8064448	Wow, very nice.
8065208	8065808	Slash Sim.
8066769	8067269	Explicit.
8069730	8070650	Slash pubic hairs.
8075192	8078333	Is this for all the 12 and 13 year olds that play MMOs or what?
8078854	8079454	Anybody?
8079834	8085916	I hope that one day... What in the hell is this slash command supposed to do?
8088638	8089118	What the...
8092379	8093080	Alright, alright.
8093480	8102625	What this code does is, well, you know how people fantasize about... It's basically a nude code without the pubic hair.
8103526	8104507	I see, okay.
8104827	8107288	Or if a boy wants to... I don't fantasize about that kind of thing.
8107689	8108209	But some do.
8109270	8114313	Speaking of which, how did your 40 days without a boner thing go, speaking of which?
8115513	8116854	Oh, by the way, I'm surviving.
8116874	8118515	I got a few more days.
8118855	8119216	Wow.
8119256	8121117	Meaning I've not got a morning boner...
8121938	8125842	or I see any attractive tits or porno or strip club.
8126122	8127423	You'll never get a boner again.
8128624	8129044	Oh, God.
8129425	8130426	All right.
8130766	8132367	Anyways, I'll explain that later.
8132487	8134149	Angel, your number two pick.
8137252	8138192	Sorry, you need a mic, don't you?
8139954	8140494	Bitch slap.
8142977	8146800	Now, would slash bitch slap bitch slap you or the other player?
8147682	8153528	Right, um, like, let's say you have somebody in your party that you don't like or isn't doing their job yet, right?
8153588	8155230	Just do slash bitch slap.
8156311	8156991	Alright, sounds good.
8157011	8159294	Um, Loki, you're number two.
8161436	8168563	I think the only appropriate thing that we're actually missing from an MMORPG is slash dingo because, you know,
8170063	8174745	When someone really pisses you off online, you really wish a dingo would go eat their baby.
8175306	8179688	And so now you can have that thanks to our brand new dingo technology.
8180308	8182649	Dingoes can and will eat your babies.
8184310	8186031	A dingo ate my baby!
8188832	8192294	My number two pick is slash Fred Durst porn video.
8193852	8206696	And the reason for this is because when you guys are feeling a little bit inadequate because you're staying in the house all day and playing MMORPGs, you can type slash Fred Durst porn video and you can see that you can have it off a lot worse and you'll feel better about yourself.
8208617	8210198	Alright, so slash Fred Durst porn video.
8212939	8214099	I typed slash Fred.
8214199	8216540	Alright, Jamie, you're number one.
8216700	8219161	My number one is slash IDBFG.
8221542	8222422	Anyone ever play Doom?
8224272	8227954	Imagine going around Final Fantasy XI with the BFG.
8233138	8233498	Okay.
8234038	8238141	Imagine gunning down anything that gets in your way with extreme prejudice.
8240162	8240623	Very nice.
8241083	8244605	I could just imagine right now, Battering Ram, fuck you!
8245106	8245506	Button.
8247007	8248208	Alright, sounds good.
8248248	8251030	So ID BFG, just like the Doom Days.
8251430	8253151	Alright, Explicit, you're number one.
8255496	8259258	Slash Tack Slash Engulf
8285541	8286282	Ah, that made you giggle.
8286642	8287903	And what pray tell does that do?
8288003	8289624	Does it engulf your opponent in flames?
8290625	8293967	Either your opponent or somebody in your party you don't like.
8295088	8296909	So engulf is the number one.
8296970	8297330	Alright.
8298411	8299651	Loki, you're number one.
8302273	8304515	I figured this is the most needed thing in the world.
8305136	8306456	Slash real girl.
8308198	8311100	Because some of those people, they need to realize...
8311721	8315602	They need to find a real girl and not masturbate to fictional women.
8316663	8318023	So slash real girl.
8319004	8320384	Yes, that's what's needed.
8322545	8326747	Alright, and my number one is slash give me a dollar.
8329548	8330228	Oh, very cool.
8332504	8334805	and when you type it, it would give you a dollar.
8335145	8336045	But you can't overuse it.
8336125	8336425	Alright.
8336926	8337726	So here it is.
8337846	8339827	Here is the list as it stands currently.
8339927	8358953	Slash window, slash yo mama, slash silly string, slash Nicole Brown Simpson, slash ab shocks, slash sim, slash pubic hairs, slash bitch slap, slash dingo, slash Fred Durst porn video, slash IDBFG, slash taku, slash engulf, slash real girl, slash give me a dollar.
8360414	8360494	Uh...
8361050	8368255	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8391960	8395642	It does kind of sound like The Sims, although I guess that's kind of the idea behind it.
8395662	8399644	But we wouldn't want people to get confused, because Americans do get a little too easily confused.
8400064	8401685	All right, Angel, one of these has got to go.
8402186	8402946	You're going to kill me.
8403906	8404407	Porn video.
8405687	8407028	That was the best one on there.
8408149	8409349	She always takes off the best one.
8409389	8412611	All right, slash Fred Durst porn video is gone.
8413312	8413952	Thanks to Angel.
8414812	8419715	I'm going to eliminate slash pubic hairs, because I didn't really get it.
8419915	8421376	So, sorry, explicit.
8422051	8424912	Alright, Loki, you're going to pick the last one that's come off this list.
8428653	8434395	I'm going to have to say Slash Window because it's just not funny.
8435275	8436375	And we need funny.
8437936	8441497	Heaven forbid someone come up with a good idea during List List.
8441557	8443457	Heaven forbid, we can't have that.
8444218	8447339	I was going to come up with Slash Poop, but, you know...
8452995	8454016	Alright, here it is.
8454916	8457618	The list that you guys will get to vote for, alright?
8458399	8462182	So, pick your favorite from that list and send me a private message with your vote.
8462202	8463803	I think Dark Knight gets a cookie.
8463863	8464183	All army.
8482470	8486713	Let's talk about some of the... Wow, a lot of you guys are participating in this.
8486773	8490216	My gosh, we've just got pages and pages of recommended slash.
8490236	8493158	So here are some honorable mentions I'm reading in the chat room.
8494819	8496080	Slash pee in your butt.
8497781	8499882	Slash fatality.
8501183	8502204	Slash tub girl.
8503745	8505386	Slash summon Martha Stewart.
8507308	8507428	Um...
8508797	8537331	slash OLR, slash Penis Enlargement, slash Forever Sunshine, slash Enzyte, slash Cash for Game Money, slash Pedobear Seal of Approval, slash I Am Not Your Game Boy, slash Pokemon Red Flash Seizure, I like that one, slash
8538567	8541389	Slash... Bathroom.
8542910	8545651	Where was... There was one I really... Oh, Slash Jesus Juice.
8545731	8547232	That was my favorite, I think.
8547913	8550414	Out of the chatroom was Slash Jesus Juice.
8552555	8554917	Who knew that Zaku could say something funny?
8555017	8555417	Who knew?
8555797	8557938	But that was, I think, my favorite out of the chatroom.
8557959	8559840	So just as one was Slash Jesus Juice.
8560880	8562741	Lots of good ones there in the chatroom, you guys.
8562781	8563202	Good job.
8564362	8567004	So send us your votes now to sky...
8568214	8568874	in the chat room.
8568954	8569714	That's great, you guys.
8570295	8570655	All right.
8571415	8578697	In the meantime, while we're tallying up the votes, we'll give you guys a couple minutes to send those votes, and we'll do a quick, quick break, and then we're going to come back with the FUs of the week.
8578777	8583298	So in this break, Moonlight Shadow, because that song rocks, and we haven't heard it in a while.
8583499	8584979	So here it is, and we'll be back after this.
8619794	8620375	and the others.

8688709	8690973	Don't you try to run.
8692115	8694780	Don't you try to hide.

8745368	8766562	Life is a game, don't want to lie Turn on your pain, let's play tonight Don't you try to run, don't you try to hide Life is a game, let's play tonight
8782264	8788506	Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Ball.
8791387	8795349	That's one of my favorite promos because it's the only one you can hear Jamie clucking like a chicken.
8798090	8799010	That's my favorite.
8799530	8802371	Okay, let's hear who won tonight's list list, shall we?
8805012	8809034	Alright, Slash Command, you would most like to see...
8810675	8811916	in an MMORPG.
8812356	8816077	Number three, slash Nicole Brown Simpson.
8817138	8818778	I don't know what the hell you guys are thinking there.
8819699	8820679	I can see why it's third.
8820719	8821559	It's been to before.
8823780	8824140	All right.
8824280	8828342	In second place, slash IDBFG.
8828582	8830063	Score one for the old schoolers.
8830603	8831023	All right.
8831643	8835185	And in first place, slash give me a dollar.
8837586	8838426	All right.
8839844	8842386	DarkSakura, DarkDeft, Drew, Carameldansen
8868075	8870957	Jamie, why do we have to get a little bit angry every single week?
8871378	8871898	Grr.
8872378	8889911	Arrgh.
8890592	8893314	You know, FD to people who drive while they talk on their cell phones.
8893874	8894034	Hey!
8894054	8894515	Hey!
8895934	8900617	I witnessed an accident nearly happen today because both drivers were on their damn cell phones.
8901337	8901897	So fuck them.
8902558	8903058	Sorry, Rob.
8903298	8905780	Well, I don't think other people should be on their cell phones, just me.
8905860	8906640	So that wouldn't have happened.
8906740	8906940	No.
8907160	8914064	Well, you know the law's going to pass this year, so I'm looking forward to that.
8914104	8921468	There's also... Shoot, I was thinking about this earlier today, and I completely forgot what it was.
8921488	8924390	Oh, yeah.
8924410	8924630	Yeah.
8925430	8926171	F you to people.
8927812	8931856	And this is more of a situational F you.
8932256	8938501	But when people complain about how much their life sucks, yet they don't do anything about it, fuck that.
8939622	8945847	You don't have a right to complain until you are actively working to remedy your situation.
8946928	8953674	You know, you can say, oh, well, I'm tired of being fat or something like that.
8954059	8955040	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
8984128	9010944	I don't understand that I also have a big SU to people who complain about not having money yet continue to frivolously spend on shit they don't need I've had to break myself of this habit too but I recognize that I don't have money because I spent it on this, this, this and this well now I can actively say
9011417	9014980	I don't have the money to spend on it because I'm saving up to buy a house, which is true.
9015040	9016261	I'm going to be buying a house this year.
9017642	9029252	Um... But it's also... It's just, again, I don't understand the whole mentality of how people can bitch about something yet not do anything to remedy it.
9029733	9030213	You know what I mean?
9031794	9035878	Um... I also big S you to, uh... Um...
9037791	9067405	the car wash line at Chevron today there were seven people in the damn line and the line wasn't moving so I'm going to have to go back after the show at night and get my car washed where the water will not evaporate as quickly big F you're not having an air conditioner but hey, I'm going to have my air conditioning replaced next week I'm doing something about it that's been my big thing is people who just don't do anything to fix their situation so I'm done here
9069008	9070129	Alright, Loki's turn!
9074071	9081575	Um, first off, I'd like to say a big fuck you to, um, LRGs, because they've been kicking my ass all week.
9082535	9095602	I'm just now starting to feel a little bit better, um, but I don't think that's gonna last very long, because it's LRG season, and I'm affected by both mold and pollen, so I'm fucked all year round.
9096574	9097994	Pretty much like I am at work.
9098235	9098475	Anyway.
9100795	9102776	Fuck you to work for being a little boring.
9103256	9112999	I tried making a catapult out of my pen last week, and I got a little bit of ink on my finger, because I guess pens don't like to be turned into catapults.
9113619	9114599	Oh well, so much for that.
9116139	9125062	And then, also, fuck you the fact that I need, like, I have this urge for projects, even though I haven't finished other projects, and I really...
9126085	9132327	It's hard, it's like crack, I can't stop, I just gotta build crap, and I don't know why.
9133027	9136888	It's like, I don't even use what I build, it's, I don't get it.
9137528	9143030	But, um, yeah, it's just some weird obsession that I have, so I just can't stop.
9143730	9152152	And, um, fuck you to Lindsay Lohan for acting, because you suck, and I don't really need you to, you know...
9152722	9155445	Why does Disney have to fucking remake every movie that they've made?
9155825	9157447	Because, you know what, all the remakes suck.
9158048	9159109	So, fuck those.
9160110	9162453	Fuck, you know, the Son of the Mask, because that sucked.
9163033	9166657	And it's still being made, and I got the damn screener for it, and it's dirty.
9167558	9172443	No, or actually, I didn't get the screener for it, but fuck, I got tickets to it, and I never went and saw it, so it was good.
9173665	9173725	Um...
9174730	9182995	And then finally, fuck you, the family that's suing Michael Jackson, because I believe that they're just seeing him as an easy target to try to get money.
9183896	9191940	And if you actually follow the testimony, there's a lot of discrepancies, let's put it that way, in their testimony.
9192481	9194482	And I hope they get sued.
9195262	9206411	Oh, and another thing, I'm not sure if anyone heard about it, there was actually a news report a while back of this guy that sued, I believe it's ABC or whoever the fuck puts out that goddamn show, Fear Factor.
9206771	9215758	He basically got sick and dizzy and fell into a door well from watching the show and so he was suing them.
9217177	9226102	And there was justice being done, and the judge said, fuck you, this is a frivolous lawsuit, and threw it right back at him, and didn't award him any money.
9226262	9228603	So, at least there's some justice in this world.
9229884	9239329	And I'm done.
9239549	9241169	An F you to E!
9241210	9245752	Entertainment Television for having those really addicting Michael Jackson trial wrap-up shows.
9246543	9249185	Would they actually reenact what's going on in the courtroom?
9249365	9250786	Because that shit is hilarious.
9251486	9256310	The guy that they have playing Michael Jackson is very eerie, like, identical.
9256390	9256890	It's crazy.
9257811	9259612	Except they drew on his nose.
9259692	9260413	I'm not kidding you.
9260473	9261033	It's horrible.
9261073	9262934	It's like his nose is drawn on.
9263555	9264535	It's disgusting.
9264996	9271940	And F you to House Hunting, because it's a pain in the ass, and I've been kind of looking for, like, a new place where the new Orange Lounge studio will be.
9272501	9272561	Um...
9273341	9276103	And we found five places on the internet we liked.
9276163	9279405	We drove by and only liked two of them when we drove by them.
9279505	9282146	And one of them is in the ghetto, so it's kind of a question mark.
9282526	9284727	Although it sucks because that was by far my favorite house.
9284768	9287089	It was such a cute little house and it had a little gate and everything.
9287369	9288950	Like, I really want it and it's affordable.
9288990	9289810	But it's in the ghetto.
9289830	9291891	I'm like, but I kind of want it.
9292312	9293552	I'm like, I could get a guard dog.
9294193	9297615	Orange Lounge Radio, coming to you live from the ghetto.
9298815	9299376	Yes, that's right.
9300296	9301577	We're coming to you from South Sac.
9303746	9304347	No, it's alright.
9305147	9305968	We'll figure something out.
9306468	9308070	I'll figure something out, I always do.
9309111	9310872	But house hunting sucks, so F you to that.
9311192	9313354	And F you to just moving in general, because moving sucks.
9315216	9317718	Because can you imagine having to clean this apartment?
9317798	9318618	It's going to suck.
9319399	9320300	It's going to be horrible.
9320400	9321961	But you know what?
9321981	9324443	The place I lived in Chico was worse.
9324843	9327386	And I made it somehow, so I'll get through this.
9328306	9331269	Alright, let's get to our guest F yous.
9331369	9332530	Starting it off with...
9333567	9335728	Oh, the marathon man himself, explicit.
9337589	9338849	Alright, let's see.
9339650	9345913	I'd like to give an Effie to work for letting me stay in the sun, for having me stay in the sun without getting me a break at work.
9347013	9347633	Jesus.
9348434	9357758	Yesterday was extremely hot and someone who was supposed to be giving breaks because I was working 10 o'clock in the morning until like 6 at night did not give me a break and everybody else got a break.
9359042	9363284	Well guess what, almost got heat stroke and almost fainted.
9365184	9370926	And AFP goes to a lot of depression towards this and pressure family wise.
9372247	9375548	Of course some of you know that my dad passed away like two years ago.
9376583	9377063	Sorry to hear that.
9377644	9383867	Yeah, and it's been tough, but some people are pushing me to a point where they don't even understand what I'm going through.
9384487	9385848	They think it's, oh, so what?
9387389	9393052	I'm like, okay, a person died two years ago, and you're going to talk trash behind his back?
9394933	9399715	That really hurts, especially when I caught somebody in the cemetery trying to steal flowers.
9400976	9401316	What?
9401676	9401976	Yes.
9402517	9403097	Oh, man.
9404850	9408471	I love my woman, but this is the only way I can... Yeah.
9410632	9413792	There's other ways to show your affection, other than stolen flowers.
9414392	9419834	Perhaps he was bringing flowers to his newly found corpse that he was gonna have sex with.
9422615	9423535	It's like I give a damn.
9423615	9423995	Anyway.
9424909	9428551	But if you steal flowers in the cemetery, then that's hella simple.
9429531	9431712	Another Effie goes to Almost Breaking Lent.
9434173	9435954	Did you get a semi-wood or something?
9436915	9438135	Came close, but no wood.
9439016	9444118	Let's see, a friend of mine tested my ability to watch three hours of porn non-stop.
9445159	9445559	I'm like...
9447042	9452606	I'm going to kill you, but then again, if I win this bet, I actually will get like a hundred bucks off of this.
9453527	9456449	How are they going to know if you got a boner or not?
9457790	9463154	Well, since I'm an honest guy, I could just... That could be a lie.
9464775	9466256	Yeah, you know what?
9467377	9470920	Yeah, I was a hardcore heroin addict and I quit.
9473041	9473782	I won a hundred dollars.
9475503	9476564	Did you guys know I'm a virgin?
9478027	9479008	I did not know about that.
9480228	9480689	Exactly.
9484551	9485731	All right, anyway, sorry, Explosive.
9486031	9487832	Okay, how much time we have?
9487972	9488313	Okay.
9488753	9489793	I don't want to take too long.
9490834	9491314	Three seconds.
9492215	9495737	Okay, NFU goes to taxes.
9496417	9499999	Someone got one of the numbers wrong that's needed to file taxes.
9501101	9501521	And guess what?
9501541	9504122	They come up to me and give me a mail saying that's the wrong number.
9504262	9508083	If I don't get the correct number, then I would have been arrested or fined a shitload of money.
9508803	9509503	I'm like, what the hell?
9509543	9510463	Why is this the wrong number?
9511724	9519285	Either the person who was coding up the... or accounting the tax is either lazy or just being a dick.
9521166	9525927	After he goes to almost being sandwiched by three cars, both...
9527267	9531369	Two of them in an SUV and one a truck behind me.
9531389	9536071	You know what happens, like DarkSakura said, about people with the cell phones.
9536472	9537532	Yes, I've actually seen that.
9537772	9540954	But this time they didn't even signal while heading to the same lane.
9542735	9543775	Which I almost got squashed.
9546497	9547777	People need to learn how to drive.
9548298	9550419	But to make sure this is short, to be continued.
9551039	9552220	Alright, Angel.
9552580	9553000	As usual.
9554475	9560920	Um, okay, to, uh, follow up on Explicit's F.U.s, F.U.
9560940	9572729	to death, because sometimes you lose people that, you know, really shouldn't have been taken away from you, as far as, you know, age or what have you.
9573409	9575271	And F.U.
9575291	9580875	to the grieving process as well, because, uh, it's not easy, it's really not.
9582336	9586159	And, yeah, so, I guess that's it.
9586559	9588000	Maybe FU the finals this week.
9589562	9592264	Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.
9595906	9602651	Legend of Zaku says, FU to the regulars and the arcade and the tourney I went to this weekend for acting like little bitches because other players were better than you.
9603072	9607295	And for having the gall to be, to begging people to fight them.
9607888	9619624	FU to having to pay $11 for a cab to leave the campus, all because of a damn bus straight up here in Westchester County in the subs of New York over petty shit that's not even worth the rider who heavily depends on it.
9619704	9622068	Change... Oh, change being to bring.
9622548	9622789	Sorry.
9624999	9628980	MPQ says F you to 7 Star Songs and Beatmania 3 for kicking my ass.
9629161	9631181	F you to Disconnected Expert for kicking my ass.
9631681	9633862	F you to Moonlight Shadow Double for kicking my ass.
9633942	9636163	And F you to myself for missing last week's show.
9636583	9639504	Don't forget you can always catch that on DDR Freaks Rewinds Friday nights.
9640214	9648943	AgentBuddyPaul says, F you to my school for sitting me in a dark auditorium and showing me a presentation on drunk drivers, mangled bodies, zombie-like people, it was horrible.
9649664	9653728	F you to drunk drivers for filling up an hour and 30 minutes worth of tragedy and gore in school.
9653768	9655109	Sounds like red asphalt to me.
9655589	9656811	They made us all watch that shit.
9657692	9662857	DarkKnight, a big F you to people that never come to work on time and relieve you for the day.
9663732	9665514	Allusion says, F you to douchebags.
9665534	9673261	There was this guy behind me kicking a bottle, a faux gangster, who told me to kick the bottle too, which I did playing along, and he said, yeah, you a gangsta in all seriousness.
9673321	9673962	Guess what, buddy?
9674002	9674862	You ain't a gangsta.
9674922	9675943	You live in the suburbs.
9676284	9679987	You have a two-story house and a car that your mommy and daddy bought you, you spoiled ass.
9680608	9689576	F you to rap for making the word ghetto used at least 30 times a day by every, and then it says blank, something, I don't know.
9690178	9694883	FU to the word ignorant and being used by people that are ignorant to the meaning of the word ignorant.
9694963	9695463	The irony.
9697045	9703151	Mikotov says, First FU goes to Sony for getting me all hyped up about the PSP.
9703211	9705713	They're just lucky they have Lumines.
9706134	9707916	Second FU goes to getting the PSP.
9709142	9714265	in at the store supposedly early this coming week and not being able to take it home despite having it fully paid.
9714685	9718207	And lastly, FU to having to put a code in for Monkey Fingers on Pump Exceed.
9718247	9720028	That song is too cool for a code.
9720748	9725731	LemonLimeJump says, FU non-native palm trees up and down McGregor Boulevard.
9726051	9729493	They hurt the native plants, create terrible blind spots, and they're ugly!
9731874	9736797	SSJ100Matt says, FU to the skater kid trying to start a fight with me for being a noob at Beatmania.
9737182	9739604	and Thinking I Wasn't Letting Him Play Before Golf Line Closed.
9740084	9741525	F you to my double date canceling.
9741645	9744707	Also, F you to Hootie selling out to do Burger King commercials.
9746068	9749710	Sephiroth1215 says, F you to annoying ex-girlfriends.
9749790	9750551	That's all I have to say.
9751291	9753193	DJ Ranma S says, and F you to life.
9753353	9755534	My friend's grandmother passed away and she's really upset.
9756275	9757295	Life sucks like that.
9757876	9760057	DarkTetsuya says, F you to coke with lime.
9760117	9760678	It's addicting.
9761678	9764560	And Dork says, F you to school because I don't know.
9764760	9765641	I'm an attention whore.
9767216	9769919	That's a good note to end on, is the attention whore note there.
9769939	9770379	I forgot one.
9770880	9771700	Oh yes, Angel.
9772561	9775704	F you to not one, but two deaths in one weekend.
9775744	9776385	Aww.
9776825	9779027	So, yeah, that's all that has to be said.
9779328	9784593	Unless you want me to do a short but sweet explanation of that.
9785536	9786416	I will leave it up to you.
9786496	9788378	I don't want you to have to get into it if you don't want to.
9788919	9792782	Well, you know, that one friend that I talked about at the beginning of the show passing away.
9793523	9796525	And then we had a staff meeting for Herschel Radio.
9800949	9807935	And right before the meeting ended, the manager got really, really quiet.
9807995	9810478	And he's like, I just got a phone call.
9810498	9812079	And everybody goes, what's wrong?
9813382	9815703	My friend just got stabbed and he passed away.
9816483	9817003	That's too bad.
9817323	9820024	So, yeah.
9821124	9822944	That was just craptacular.
9823024	9825785	Anyway, I'll shut up now and give you back the show.
9825885	9826705	That's alright, that's alright.
9827746	9840009	Okay, so, on a completely different note, and when I say completely, I mean completely different note, Loki is looking up images on, I guess it's Bomani Styles image boards, and he's pulled up Poppin' Porn.
9840129	9841029	What the hell is this?
9842835	9845578	It's back in their not-work-safe section.
9845598	9847940	I just figured I'd take a look and see what's in there.
9848761	9851964	And they've got a lot of not-work-safe stuff in there.
9852144	9856288	And I don't know who the fuck draws this shit, honestly.
9856308	9858490	But apparently there's a lot of it out there.
9859370	9862553	They've got some really graphic pictures.
9862593	9864535	Like, for example, let's see here.
9867237	9868539	We have this one right here.
9868559	9868799	This is
9869401	9872462	I think it's Japanese people that actually draw those pictures.
9872482	9874502	Get a life!
9875363	9877163	You can have a life in Japan as well, yes.
9898700	9903343	I'm not sure, if you're Japanese, I say F you to having a Resident Evil 4 censored game.
9904104	9912910	For those who haven't noticed, the Resident Evil 4 in Japan has no head cuts like Leon's head cut off or the zombies.
9913890	9917573	It's a weird game, but without the heads cut off.
9917633	9918553	Stupid censorship.
9918893	9925258	It's funny that they have more inappropriate stuff for other children compared to the ones we have in America.
9925278	9925898	Yeah.
9926505	9926786	Oh well.
9927567	9929549	Sucks to be in Japan for that.
9930150	9932413	Alright, we're going to go to a quick break, you guys.
9932453	9935818	When we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge, because we haven't done it in a while.
9935838	9938682	So if you have a question for us, send it over private message in the chat room.
9939003	9940565	And then we're also going to wrap things up, you guys.
9940605	9942007	So we will be back after this.
9958533	9975000	Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue Thought I heard you talking so slowly I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?
10049890	10051351	Thank you for watching
10086678	10087741	Thanks for watching!
10124542	10130365	please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry
10141385	10144327	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10144807	10148049	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10148489	10151831	Will Loki ever find the Tekken 5 soundtrack?
10152271	10155433	Or will Jamie be forced to taunt him because she has it already?
10155713	10160636	Now you can see what we talk about in the studio on breaks.
10161877	10164118	Alright, let's start it off with a question from MPQ.
10164859	10168401	My sister thinks all Taku songs sound the same.
10169121	10170642	Obviously, this is unacceptable.
10171294	10172196	What do I do to fix this?
10174982	10176045	Chain her to a chair.
10176586	10177729	I was thinking the exact same thing.
10178832	10190161	and put her in one of those sensory deprivation things except that all it plays is Taku music and she'll learn the subtle differences.
10190601	10191061	That's right.
10192282	10192943	You know what you should do?
10193003	10204832	If she listens to CDs in the car, I don't know how old your sister is, assuming she's of drivable age, if she listens to CDs in the car or even the CDs in her CD player, switch out for Bounce Connected or other Taku albums.
10205376	10208739	She'll thank you later for the great music you're providing her, trust me.
10210401	10211602	Alright, next up.
10212042	10215886	RPGKing7 says, Question for all who use Stepmania.
10217127	10221151	I was wondering if you have any tips for someone who has just started getting into it.
10221961	10226103	A little bit vague because we're not sure if you're talking about making step files or downloading.
10226143	10229404	I'm assuming you're going to mean you just are getting into it for the first time and downloading.
10229424	10231385	I can probably explain this since I am a sim artist myself.
10231425	10233506	Alright, make it quick though, explicit, because we've only got about 10 minutes.
10233646	10240009	Alright, the tips on sim files is one, select a good song that you feel like people would enjoy.
10241209	10247212	And two, use programs like Acid or whatever.
10247692	10249633	As long as you cut the track correctly.
10250819	10251199	Perfectly.
10252360	10256083	And three, try to also use DWI.
10257084	10269554	I'm not sure if other dudes' DWI tutorial is online, but if you need that, I can probably send it to you via AOL Instant Messenger for those who are interested in sim file making.
10269735	10272877	So if you're into sim file making, those are some good resources for you.
10272897	10277941	If you're into sim file playing, my advice would be go and get some of those big pack songs, like Food Mix.
10278942	10279542	and things like that.
10279583	10282324	Go get some of those really, really well done sim files.
10282645	10284646	Look for the high rated stuff on Bomani Style.
10285046	10301718	Look for artists who have done a lot of songs because artists, you know, folks that have done, you know, when I say artists, I mean like step file background and so forth, artists, folks who have made a lot of songs have probably learned from their past mistakes so they start producing really quality stuff so look for that.
10302639	10308003	I mean, it makes this, they have like, you can get the label either keyboard or pad so people do not like
10308413	10310694	How did Orange Lounge Radio come about?
10339493	10340734	Oh, you want to tell it or should I?
10340754	10341675	Why don't you?
10342676	10343877	We were on the BART.
10345458	10346419	Bay Area Rapid Transit.
10347660	10349321	Coming back from San Francisco, I thought.
10349361	10351743	No, we first discussed it going to San Francisco.
10352464	10354225	And then we finalized it on the way back.
10355646	10361291	But we wanted to do the station for some time because I had a lot of fun subbing on Under Sedation.
10362432	10366315	And Kay basically came up with the idea, everything that day.
10366435	10368657	And we were broadcasting, what, in a couple weeks?
10368857	10369737	Yeah, didn't take long.
10370557	10374738	So basically it's just, you know, we were having fun with Under Station Live.
10375178	10381560	I know personally I was dying to sit behind the control panel for another show because Travis always sat behind the control panel for that show.
10381960	10390642	So I kind of wanted to do one where I could sit behind the control panel just because I'd done it when I was doing college radio and stuff.
10390702	10391442	So it worked out.
10391562	10396483	And Jamie I knew was, you know, somebody I would want to do the radio show with because she had all that experience on Under Station.
10397103	10400484	and also a vast knowledge of Bomani and video games in general.
10400904	10402385	That's because I have no life.
10402745	10403885	She made a good partner for that.
10403925	10406746	And then Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out really good.
10407166	10409527	He won a host spot for perfect attendance.
10409547	10409887	He did.
10411007	10411327	All right.
10413068	10413588	Dark Knight.
10414348	10415668	Here's a question for Orange Lounge Radio.
10415728	10419890	Do you think that Nintendo DS's online gimmick will be worth it?
10421710	10424931	We're going to talk about this on the podcast this week, but the online gimmick.
10426427	10431568	DarkTetsuya says, Here's what I meant to ask.
10431608	10433009	What was everyone's first cata?
10433029	10437930	So in DDR, your first catastrophic song that you beat.
10437950	10438290	Jamie.
10440250	10442051	Jamie.
10457651	10458392	My favorite one?
10458772	10459272	Your first.
10459472	10459933	My first?
10460153	10460233	Oh.
10460693	10462294	My first was Hypnotic Crisis.
10462494	10463735	That was my first as well.
10464936	10465856	Anybody else care to share?
10466737	10469439	I would say the same thing back then with Hypnotic Crisis.
10470900	10472761	Paranoia Eternal.
10474142	10474622	Fucking easy.
10475363	10481707	Or if you count Paranoia K-Set and Dropout before it became Switch as a 9, or Burn the Floor in Max 2.
10483328	10484108	What the hell's up with that?
10484148	10484909	Burn in the floor?
10484969	10485589	Give me a break.
10485850	10486230	Ha ha ha.
10487355	10488115	That was weird.
10488135	10490397	I remember talking about that before, a long time ago on this show.
10491377	10494839	I can express one I'm working on, although it probably wasn't the best choice.
10495600	10497621	My Summer Love from, like, Fourth Mix.
10497781	10499362	My Summer Love, I think, was my second one.
10499422	10501143	So that's not a bad one to be trying, I don't think.
10501243	10501443	Okay.
10501743	10502324	In my opinion.
10502904	10505946	Or like, um, no wait, that's like an eight, isn't it?
10506026	10506346	Never mind.
10507066	10507467	No, no, no.
10507747	10511249	I was going to say Spin the Disc, but I don't remember what number that is.
10512209	10512770	Okay, that's an eight.
10512830	10513330	Never mind!
10514031	10517372	Alright, we're going to burn through some of these other questions real fast because we've got to wrap up the show here.
10517933	10528877	Mikulatov, Dear AskOrangeLounge, seeing as how Sony doesn't seem to have as many ads out for its PSP but it's got so much hype behind it, do you think that it will be as huge of a hit as the PS2?
10532498	10536680	When you phrase the question that way, will it be a bigger hit than the PS2, I have to say no.
10536940	10539421	I think the PS2 is just untoppable in that regard.
10539941	10540961	I think it'll be a hit.
10541021	10542562	I don't think the PSP is going to be a failure.
10542947	10546590	Legend of Zaku says, What was the worst Bomani-related drama you have ever seen?
10573012	10573672	MGL2.
10575173	10575894	Remember MGL2?
10575934	10581517	That was pretty bad when we had the guy who smashed food all over the stage and stuff.
10582338	10587101	Oh my god, weeks and weeks of web board posts after that.
10588562	10592204	I just remember the local drama with certain people.
10592844	10593124	Yeah.
10593485	10593805	That was...
10594269	10600191	I'm like, come to think of it, a lot of the big Bomani drama that I remember, I was directly involved with.
10600511	10604313	Well, I'm not just saying that, I'm referring to other people too.
10604513	10605093	I know, I know.
10606313	10611775	Yeah, I know, when I think about Bomani drama, unfortunately, I think about the stuff that impacted me the most, which, you know.
10611995	10617938	Of course, the two, I think, who were the greatest causes, I would say, are no longer in the scene.
10618258	10619058	Yeah, true.
10620646	10622827	LemonLimeJump says, What do you guys think of an Orange Lounge Radio Winamp skin?
10642697	10645238	Hey, if somebody wants to do one, that's awesome.
10645298	10648020	I unfortunately have no artistic skill whatsoever.
10648220	10648860	I have no time.
10649040	10655524	But if somebody wants to make one, and we approve of it, and we're pretty easily win-over-able, we'll put it up in our download section on the website.
10655644	10658605	I think that would be kind of a neat thing to have, because I know a lot of people use WAMP.
10658945	10662787	As long as it works with the newest version or whatever, I'm cool with it, too.
10662927	10663968	Yeah, it can work.
10664108	10664748	Most of them do.
10666189	10670211	Any prospective artists out there that want to try that, hey, we will totally support you in that.
10670231	10670911	I think it's a good idea.
10671592	10672252	I never thought of that.
10672722	10673322	That's a good thought.
10674363	10678507	And lastly, Illusion wants to know, why are people so lame?
10678987	10681029	Seriously, WTF.
10681930	10682970	Why are people so lame?
10683651	10684252	It's their parents.
10685573	10685833	Yeah.
10687454	10688435	They were raised badly.
10690216	10690537	Alright.
10692098	10695161	That's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.
10695201	10696662	We'll do it again in future weeks.
10696702	10700965	Remember, you can always ask us questions over on our forums, www.orangeloungeradio.com
10702191	10703612	and just check out the forums over there.
10704112	10705653	It's time to wrap up the show, you guys.
10705753	10706994	It's been a fun three hours.
10707974	10711536	Next week on the show, more of what you've come to know and love.
10711556	10713837	Hopefully we have more news on Night Style we can share with you guys.
10714177	10719860	Hopefully Song Pack 9 makes its debut so we can give you guys our review on that and who knows what else.
10720741	10723082	You're going to have a lost guest.
10723282	10723782	Oh, that's right.
10723802	10723862	Oh!
10726218	10732684	There might be that thingy on Saturday, which I need to... Yeah, thank you for reminding me about that, because I want to talk to these two about it after the show.
10733304	10734065	Okay, thank you.
10736507	10737888	Yeah, I'll tell you after the show.
10738008	10739430	Anyway, final thought time!
10739470	10739870	Sorry, guys.
10742092	10746836	Sometimes I wish there was a delay button that I could hit that would dump the stream so I could just say it and then dump it.
10747277	10750079	Anyway, someday when we're real radio.
10750479	10751180	Angel, your final thought.
10753027	10756330	Um, Nintendo DS is going to be cool.
10757431	10757551	Err.
10759093	10760214	Uh, Explicit, your final thought.
10763457	10764578	33 days and still counting.
10765058	10765619	Oh, Jesus Christ.
10767051	10796305	my final thought is yes chat room there will be some outside the box this week because we've got Lanky Style and Rice Princess back and they're going to be reviewing the Dear Friends concert from this last Monday which is why they weren't able to make it this week and there was some other stuff going on which really exciting news Orange Lounge Radio is going to get some nice exposure I can't say much more than that we'll know more as the week goes on Loki I better not hear any crap about next week not this week
10797299	10802902	Robot Chicken, which will feature a segment called A Day in the Life of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.
10803762	10804302	No crap.
10804823	10805023	Okay.
10806123	10806443	Hot.
10806844	10807944	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10812766	10814927	Just when I thought we were going to get through one week without it.
10816708	10818549	The final word of the day.
10819089	10821470	Loki has his handout, which means I guess he has an idea.
10822011	10822431	Thanks, you guys.
10822451	10823211	We'll see you next week.
10823431	10824732	Oh, you know, you have another thought.
10825532	10828373	I was just going to say, Jamie's being such a dumb-o, Beth.
10832295	10836417	Alright, Jamie, in response to that, I will give you the final word of the day.
10836497	10836997	Thanks, you guys.
10837017	10837698	See you next week.
10837858	10838938	Jamie, the final word of the day.
10839639	10839939	So?
10841319	10846202	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

10865914	10867174	I grew up in San Francisco.
10868555	10874116	I grew up in the midst of Polk Street, hanky code, poppers, San Francisco.
10874677	10875977	So that's my childhood.
10876077	10878498	So I feel really comfortable in talking about it.
10878778	10887901	My parents owned a bookstore on Polk Street, and my mother was in charge of the gay porn, which is crazy.
10888721	10892002	She would pull out these books and show me to talk about it.
10893752	10898814	This book, this book, it's called Ace Master.
10899374	10902556	What is an Ace Master?
10902576	10903356	What is that?
10903416	10906777	I don't know what an Ace Master is.
10906818	10910939	Why do you need an Ace Master?
10910979	10912900	This book is an Ace Master.

10939258	10940880	They like ass and...
10941892	10947435	But they like AIDS too much, you know that?
10947475	10969948	You have to have AIDS in moderation You cannot have AIDS all the time Because if you have AIDS all the time
