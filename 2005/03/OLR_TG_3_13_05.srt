00:00:27,967 --> 00:00:34,769
[SPEAKER_04]: Your home for all that news on video games that don't suck, and well, some that do, because it just sneaks in there sometimes.

3
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:37,249
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

4
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

[SPEAKER_04]: Say hello also to Loki.

11
00:00:52,834 --> 00:00:55,974
[SPEAKER_03]: I am referred to as a tsunami to these gummy bears.

12
00:00:57,135 --> 00:00:57,655
[SPEAKER_04]: How so?

13
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:01,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've already eaten so many of them and taken their lives.

14
00:01:02,542 --> 00:01:02,882
[SPEAKER_04]: I see.

15
00:01:03,983 --> 00:01:05,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Three pounds down since last week.

16
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:07,384
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of gummy.

17
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,545
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you thrown up gummy yet?

18
00:01:09,825 --> 00:01:10,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

19
00:01:10,366 --> 00:01:10,706
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

20
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:14,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's get into it.

21
00:01:14,448 --> 00:01:16,128
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of games have you guys been playing this week?

22
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:17,109
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura?

23
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:23,492
[SPEAKER_02]: I played a little Final Fantasy XI, like maybe for ten minutes.

24
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:26,362
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I did some significant play earlier in the week.

25
00:01:27,843 --> 00:01:28,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of Tekken 5.

26
00:01:30,045 --> 00:01:31,325
[SPEAKER_02]: Got to see all the endings now.

27
00:01:32,226 --> 00:01:34,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Ganryu's ending is hilarious.

28
00:01:36,108 --> 00:01:37,729
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really it.

29
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,652
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, so a little more Tekken 5 for DarkSakura.

30
00:01:42,672 --> 00:01:44,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Jamie, er, sorry, Loki.

31
00:01:46,095 --> 00:01:49,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Parodius, I played that for a little bit on the main cabinet.

32
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:51,438
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um,

33
00:01:52,125 --> 00:01:54,327
[SPEAKER_03]: The rest of the week was just Final Fantasy XI.

34
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:56,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots and lots of Final Fantasy XI.

35
00:01:59,011 --> 00:02:00,152
[SPEAKER_04]: Same old theme going on.

36
00:02:00,192 --> 00:02:01,353
[SPEAKER_04]: Why Parodius?

37
00:02:02,054 --> 00:02:02,354
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

38
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:03,115
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

39
00:02:03,615 --> 00:02:10,301
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Aliens vs. Predator last week, and I'll play probably another game, because I have to get my money's worth out of this cabinet.

40
00:02:10,802 --> 00:02:14,265
[SPEAKER_03]: And to put it this way, that's $3,000 worth of quarters.

41
00:02:15,166 --> 00:02:15,466
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

42
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:43,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I decided to treat myself to some new video games this week so I went out shopping the other day and I picked up a copy of Zelda Minish Cap because I've been meaning to get that for a long time so I have that for my DS now and yes I know that Minish Cap is a Game Boy Advance game but you know what my DS is my Game Boy Advance right now because it doesn't need up batteries like the Game Boy Advance does because you just plug it in and all that so I'm loving the Minish Cap right now I think it's a great game I love the 16-bit

43
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:47,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Zelda game, of course, linked to the past.

44
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,763
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think that Minish Cap kind of invokes a lot of that old stuff.

45
00:02:50,783 --> 00:02:54,066
[SPEAKER_04]: But the cool thing is, they take a lot from, like, Ocarina of Time.

46
00:02:54,086 --> 00:02:59,252
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, they take a lot of the music, they take some of the new enemies that were in there, like the Deku nuts and stuff like that.

47
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:01,154
[SPEAKER_04]: They show up, but in 16-bit form.

48
00:03:01,474 --> 00:03:02,475
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just think that's so cool.

49
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,719
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like the puzzle element of turning small and all that stuff.

50
00:03:06,339 --> 00:03:06,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty good game.

51
00:03:07,532 --> 00:03:17,720
[SPEAKER_04]: I also picked up, because it was only $10, because it's kind of an older game now, but I picked up a copy of Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, because I guess we just needed a new MMO to talk about on this program.

52
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:21,423
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know Jamie used to play PSO a long time ago, but you stopped, right?

53
00:03:21,463 --> 00:03:25,206
[SPEAKER_02]: My characters are still... I think I just hit V-Hard.

54
00:03:26,066 --> 00:03:30,630
[SPEAKER_02]: So, if you want to help leveling, I've got people who'll help you level.

55
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:31,471
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

56
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,252
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and we've got stuff for you.

57
00:03:33,712 --> 00:03:36,314
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Al Rappi's, which you're not supposed to have.

58
00:03:37,702 --> 00:03:38,503
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, sounds good.

59
00:03:38,583 --> 00:03:39,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe, maybe.

60
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:44,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of liked Phantasy Star Online because it reminds me of a 3D Diablo.

61
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,487
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of why I like that game.

62
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:47,508
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

63
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:52,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought about playing it again because I actually do have it for the Dreamcast, but I gotta cheat.

64
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:54,393
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I do.

65
00:03:54,413 --> 00:03:55,954
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way you can play games is to cheat.

66
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,936
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you think that cheating in MMORPGs is unethical?

67
00:03:59,156 --> 00:03:59,336
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

68
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:01,097
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

69
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll start off some gaming news tonight with some news about an MMORPG.

70
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:08,615
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard said they were going to do this for a long time.

71
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:09,376
[SPEAKER_04]: They finally did it.

72
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:16,401
[SPEAKER_04]: They closed over 1,000 accounts related to gold farming on World of Warcraft and character sales.

73
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:25,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Blizzard says, Over the recent weeks, we have been investigating the activities of certain individuals who have been farming gold in order to sell it in exchange for real world currency.

74
00:04:26,068 --> 00:04:29,671
[SPEAKER_04]: After researching the situation, we have issued permanent suspensions to over 1,000 accounts.

75
00:04:31,292 --> 00:04:32,753
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been engaging in this practice.

76
00:04:32,813 --> 00:04:39,537
[SPEAKER_04]: We do not condone such actions and will take decisive action as they are against our policy and damage the game economy as a whole.

77
00:04:39,997 --> 00:04:44,900
[SPEAKER_04]: 1,000 World of Warcraft players get in the boot, which should hopefully speed up some of those servers.

78
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:45,841
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

79
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:47,422
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think about this, Loki?

80
00:04:47,462 --> 00:04:50,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you have a strong opinion on buying stuff in-game with real money.

81
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:53,945
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a problem with it, but I think it's a good idea.

82
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:54,706
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

83
00:04:55,367 --> 00:05:03,470
[SPEAKER_04]: That Square Enix is always threatening Oh, we're gonna do something You watch, one of these days we're gonna do something Well, didn't they ban like 700 people?

84
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was more for harassing players No, it wasn't 700 people, it was 80 people I'm sorry, 80?

85
00:05:08,352 --> 00:05:13,714
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 people, 80, over the, over And this is over, like, you know, what, 24 servers?

86
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:25,079
[SPEAKER_04]: No, wait a minute, I thought it was like 800 And then when you went across the number of servers there were It was like maybe 20 people a server or something No, it wasn't anything Weird And all the guild sellers are still there Oh, yeah

87
00:05:26,616 --> 00:05:29,537
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, any opinion you have on buying and selling?

88
00:05:29,557 --> 00:05:30,557
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't do it, honestly.

89
00:05:30,877 --> 00:05:36,418
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd just be all cute in-game and have people, oh, I feel sorry for you, here's money.

90
00:05:53,081 --> 00:05:56,046
[SPEAKER_04]: So you would like to be the equivalent of an MMO bum?

91
00:05:56,066 --> 00:05:56,987
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

92
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:04,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm actually going to stop selling my crystals so that I can make lumber and give people wood.

93
00:06:07,263 --> 00:06:07,704
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

94
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:23,472
[SPEAKER_04]: I was thinking if you got desperate, you could start turning tricks and MMOs for De Niro, but that's what's already going on in Sims Online, from what I understand, is that Sims Online just turned into a giant Vegas, so that's why nobody's really playing it.

95
00:06:23,752 --> 00:06:26,274
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't have emotes for that yet in Final Fantasy XI.

96
00:06:26,575 --> 00:06:27,696
[SPEAKER_04]: What, turning tricks?

97
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:28,416
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

98
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:29,137
[SPEAKER_04]: Just you wait.

99
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:32,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Slash Pizza was only the beginning for these MMOs.

100
00:06:33,427 --> 00:06:34,688
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

101
00:06:52,564 --> 00:06:54,305
[SPEAKER_04]: And sure enough, here it is.

102
00:06:54,365 --> 00:06:55,006
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming true.

103
00:06:55,486 --> 00:07:00,589
[SPEAKER_04]: They've announced that the next console, the Revolution console, is going to have Wi-Fi.

104
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:05,472
[SPEAKER_04]: And I could swear this was just last week when I was saying it would connect to your DS via Wi-Fi.

105
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,173
[SPEAKER_04]: They would be stupid not to put it in there.

106
00:07:07,253 --> 00:07:09,874
[SPEAKER_03]: This was months ago that we've announced this.

107
00:07:09,934 --> 00:07:11,615
[SPEAKER_03]: It was months ago that this was going to happen.

108
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:16,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Also months ago, I mean... Well, we speculated it, but now it's official.

109
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:16,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, come on.

110
00:07:17,158 --> 00:07:18,179
[SPEAKER_03]: We knew this was going to happen.

111
00:07:18,259 --> 00:07:19,019
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying.

112
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,541
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a thin line you've got to draw there, so...

113
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,561
[SPEAKER_04]: Certainly no big surprise there, but here's the other interesting part.

114
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:28,844
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, we've been speculating this for quite some time now.

115
00:07:29,304 --> 00:07:33,488
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo's announced that the DSs are going to be going online.

116
00:07:33,928 --> 00:07:42,617
[SPEAKER_04]: So just like you go into a Starbucks and you have a Wi-Fi hotspot type place, even if you have a hotspot in your house with Wi-Fi, now your DS can get on the internet.

117
00:07:42,637 --> 00:07:47,321
[SPEAKER_03]: See, but I thought those spots you had to pay for, or you had to have some sort of password to get into them.

118
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Nintendo, now we don't know the details on this yet, so maybe this could change.

119
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:54,343
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nintendo is saying right now this is going to be a free service.

120
00:07:54,603 --> 00:07:55,123
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

121
00:07:55,163 --> 00:07:57,143
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's just using the internet, it's already there.

122
00:07:57,523 --> 00:07:58,864
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess who's got Wi-Fi at home?

123
00:07:58,964 --> 00:07:59,344
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

124
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:01,204
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going to be able to use the DS on the internet.

125
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:05,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Very first game that's going to support this, Animal Crossing DS.

126
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:06,906
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so happy.

127
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:13,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Which makes a lot of fanboys and girls of that game very happy because a lot of people have been saying since that game first came out,

128
00:08:13,991 --> 00:08:14,851
[SPEAKER_04]: I should be online.

129
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:17,753
[SPEAKER_04]: Forget... And we were all in Animal Crossing.

130
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,855
[SPEAKER_04]: I know all three of us were really all up on that game when it first came out.

131
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:23,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, of course, was cheating on it to the best of his ability.

132
00:08:24,497 --> 00:08:31,360
[SPEAKER_03]: I was only utilizing an error that they made in their game programming, okay?

133
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not use any sort of codes.

134
00:08:34,022 --> 00:08:36,123
[SPEAKER_03]: I just found a way to duplicate items, okay?

135
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:38,844
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember like, hey, Jamie, you're going out of town.

136
00:08:38,884 --> 00:08:41,766
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me borrow your village so I can get your villagers to say shit and fuck.

137
00:08:43,342 --> 00:08:44,082
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.

138
00:08:44,683 --> 00:08:45,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember that.

139
00:08:45,783 --> 00:08:48,545
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember, I was so mad when my town lesbian left.

140
00:08:49,085 --> 00:08:49,705
[SPEAKER_04]: That's right.

141
00:08:49,985 --> 00:08:50,746
[SPEAKER_02]: What was her name?

142
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:51,746
[SPEAKER_04]: Olivia?

143
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:53,727
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Olivia was the pretty white cat.

144
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:55,828
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, oh man, I don't know.

145
00:08:56,229 --> 00:08:59,891
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, I remember I even made the sign to hang outside of her house.

146
00:09:01,327 --> 00:09:02,327
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you can make the signs.

147
00:09:02,347 --> 00:09:04,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I love how you can make the signs.

148
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:08,129
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to be scared because you're going to have people vandalizing your towns and shit.

149
00:09:08,409 --> 00:09:09,970
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be crazy.

150
00:09:10,670 --> 00:09:13,291
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have animal crossing gangs.

151
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:15,371
[SPEAKER_03]: I am kidding you not.

152
00:09:15,391 --> 00:09:20,153
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to be flashing their gang colors and there's going to be gang signs.

153
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,393
[SPEAKER_03]: People are going to get tagged.

154
00:09:21,773 --> 00:09:23,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think... You're going to get hackers out there?

155
00:09:24,074 --> 00:09:24,715
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.

156
00:09:24,895 --> 00:09:29,577
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think, and I would hope, that Nintendo is already one step ahead of you in the planning of this game.

157
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll make it... Because Nintendo's always been a very family-friendly thing.

158
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:42,183
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't want any old person going into some seven-year-old's village and starting to make the townspeople say, you know, fuck me silly, you know, things like that.

159
00:09:42,663 --> 00:09:50,627
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would think that there's going to be something set up where you will have to grant permission to only trusted individuals to enter your town, I would imagine.

160
00:09:52,602 --> 00:10:02,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's screen name is going to be Free Candy Jesus Juice Do you remember what my island was called?

161
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:09,008
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was like Big Tits or something And what was it like God, what was my town called?

162
00:10:09,048 --> 00:10:18,992
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like something cock It was like Big Cock or Monster Cock or something Big Cock, yes And note the great thing though is I am going to take

163
00:10:21,364 --> 00:10:23,785
[SPEAKER_03]: and shrink it down to the pixel size.

164
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:27,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Goat Sam, I'm going to put it all over the place.

165
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,668
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life.

166
00:10:29,288 --> 00:10:29,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Get a life.

167
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:31,049
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be fun.

168
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:32,750
[SPEAKER_04]: You will be denied access to my village.

169
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,514
[SPEAKER_04]: But this is just going to... I can't even think of the implications this game is going to have.

170
00:10:39,634 --> 00:10:41,815
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be a very exciting thing, I think.

171
00:10:42,315 --> 00:10:42,675
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't.

172
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:43,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be bored.

173
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:47,238
[SPEAKER_03]: This game is coming out the day after my birthday or it's coming out the same week.

174
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:52,549
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that this was done to kind of one-up the PSP right before its launch date?

175
00:10:53,310 --> 00:10:59,111
[SPEAKER_03]: PSP said it's going to be online, but honestly, I think we're going to see that PSP is pretty much just Xbox Live.

176
00:10:59,832 --> 00:11:07,974
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been like this whole thing, DS versus PSP, has been like this big cock-waving competition where it's like, Oh yeah, well the DS is going to come out first.

177
00:11:08,214 --> 00:11:08,534
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

178
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:10,655
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well the PSP is going to show movies.

179
00:11:10,915 --> 00:11:11,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

180
00:11:11,535 --> 00:11:13,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, well the DS is going to be online.

181
00:11:13,336 --> 00:11:13,676
[SPEAKER_04]: Thwack!

182
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:15,337
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, so is the PSP!

183
00:11:15,837 --> 00:11:17,678
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just, you know, continuing, you know?

184
00:11:18,258 --> 00:11:28,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but where there's going to be 18 titles for launch on the PSP, 15 or 18, Nintendo's only coming out with like one game.

185
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:33,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, that's really DS's weakness, but Nintendo, they've always been good at this.

186
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:36,907
[SPEAKER_04]: When their game comes out, their game is just...

187
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:44,550
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to do the Game Boy Advance 2 or SP2 or whatever.

188
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:45,291
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Game Boy Advance 2.

189
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because the DS isn't the Game Boy.

190
00:11:49,574 --> 00:11:51,255
[SPEAKER_02]: The DS is supposed to be the adult system.

191
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:54,518
[SPEAKER_02]: It's being marketed in Japan as the system for adults.

192
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,243
[SPEAKER_04]: I wouldn't get that impression.

193
00:11:56,303 --> 00:12:01,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It may be in Japan, but here... Yeah, because he knows Zookeeper.

194
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:02,029
[SPEAKER_04]: Woo!

195
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:03,811
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an adult title.

196
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:11,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, actually, since it's basically just a ripoff of Bejeweled, I see tons of people that I work with wasting their day away playing Bejeweled instead of working, might I add.

197
00:12:12,981 --> 00:12:14,303
[SPEAKER_04]: So, something to think about.

198
00:12:14,443 --> 00:12:14,903
[SPEAKER_04]: Slackers.

199
00:12:15,064 --> 00:12:15,324
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

200
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:23,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Nintendo, they always have that one game that comes out that makes you have to buy their system.

201
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,300
[SPEAKER_04]: So, DarkSakura, if you have a moment, I'd like you to come over, if you can.

202
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,260
[SPEAKER_04]: Bring your microphone.

203
00:12:29,061 --> 00:12:34,422
[SPEAKER_04]: Because DarkSakura is probably the only gamer on the planet that has not seen this this week yet.

204
00:12:35,403 --> 00:12:38,864
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the brand new Zelda trailer from the GDC.

205
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,325
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to give a running commentary of what's going on in the trailer.

206
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:43,264
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get Jamie's live reaction.

207
00:12:43,324 --> 00:12:47,486
[SPEAKER_04]: So here is the brand new Zelda trailer, which I know doesn't make for great radio.

208
00:12:48,086 --> 00:12:50,167
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it'll help you relive some memories here.

209
00:12:50,287 --> 00:12:51,488
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

210
00:12:52,568 --> 00:12:54,409
[SPEAKER_04]: So, of course, it starts off rating pending.

211
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Legend of Zelda.

212
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:04,354
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Link looking all manly and swimming around in a very nice-looking water scene.

213
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,456
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just some lighting.

214
00:13:08,776 --> 00:13:08,936
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

215
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,497
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Link saving a kitty.

216
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:11,157
[SPEAKER_04]: He has kitty!

217
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:14,192
[SPEAKER_04]: And then just a very scary statue thing.

218
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:17,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more fighting at night.

219
00:13:17,373 --> 00:13:18,614
[SPEAKER_04]: And then Link riding a horse.

220
00:13:18,654 --> 00:13:19,654
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at how great this looks.

221
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:22,196
[SPEAKER_04]: And some, like, boar-looking creatures in the game as well.

222
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:25,177
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

223
00:13:25,457 --> 00:13:26,017
[SPEAKER_04]: It might have been.

224
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:30,439
[SPEAKER_01]: It might have been.

225
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:32,320
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the skeleton creatures.

226
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:38,643
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some more fighting in the underground.

227
00:13:39,543 --> 00:13:40,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Some scary ghost creatures.

228
00:13:41,624 --> 00:13:44,206
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear this is just like Ocarina.

229
00:13:45,046 --> 00:13:47,088
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it's like way better looking.

230
00:13:48,008 --> 00:13:51,530
[SPEAKER_04]: And look at this, riding the horse and fighting at the same time, fighting creatures.

231
00:13:54,692 --> 00:13:58,395
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, of course, Goma shows up in every game.

232
00:14:00,216 --> 00:14:00,997
[SPEAKER_04]: Some more fighting.

233
00:14:02,117 --> 00:14:04,579
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there he is riding one of those boar-type creatures.

234
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Just some fighting with a kind of interesting freeze effect.

235
00:14:10,788 --> 00:14:13,011
[SPEAKER_04]: When He Hits Something, and then of course the wolf thing at the end.

236
00:14:13,231 --> 00:14:14,533
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the new Zelda trailer.

237
00:14:14,553 --> 00:14:21,441
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of stuff that they took from Wind Waker as well.

238
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:24,304
[SPEAKER_03]: So I noticed a lot of that stuff too that they have adapted from it.

239
00:14:24,965 --> 00:14:27,188
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the game they should have put out instead of Wind Waker.

240
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:27,829
[SPEAKER_03]: It is.

241
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:28,790
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been saying.

242
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:29,691
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.

243
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,454
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, that was my reaction too.

244
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:55,697
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm sure a lot of folks.

245
00:14:56,679 --> 00:15:00,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you guys that want to download the trailer for yourself, tons of gaming sites out there have it.

246
00:15:00,628 --> 00:15:01,871
[SPEAKER_04]: Just look around on some of the big ones.

247
00:15:02,372 --> 00:15:30,631
[SPEAKER_04]: You will not have a problem finding that, trust me Alright, let's talk about one other console real fast Sony, PlayStation 3 Rumor is they're going to show it next week But we didn't see anything yet Who knows, but we will be seeing it for sure At E3 in LA later on this year So that's all we know so far about what's going on with PlayStation 3 So they're kind of, whereas Nintendo and Xbox Are kind of showing off what they've got We'll talk about Xbox in a little bit

248
00:15:31,633 --> 00:15:34,454
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 3's keeping some of it a secret.

249
00:15:34,474 --> 00:15:36,535
[SPEAKER_04]: You've heard some of it, but not a whole lot.

250
00:15:36,555 --> 00:15:38,235
[SPEAKER_03]: PlayStation 3's got a lot under the hood.

251
00:15:38,315 --> 00:15:40,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been hearing.

252
00:15:40,716 --> 00:15:43,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're basically keeping it under wraps.

253
00:15:43,257 --> 00:15:46,118
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, Xbox, look at what we can do in the PS3.

254
00:15:46,138 --> 00:15:48,018
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, yeah, but look at this.

255
00:15:48,379 --> 00:15:49,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Boo yeah!

256
00:15:49,619 --> 00:15:50,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Served!

257
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,340
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

258
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:56,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get to a segment called, well, do we have a name for this?

259
00:15:57,222 --> 00:15:59,904
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but DarkSakura, oh yes, DarkSakura's Advice Column.

260
00:16:00,444 --> 00:16:03,987
[SPEAKER_04]: And DarkSakura is going to better your life with some advice.

261
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:06,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Useful advice.

262
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,551
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, very usable advice.

263
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:17,879
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're feeling a little, you know, tingly after thinking about that Zelda trailer all over again, here's some of DarkSakura's advice to put you in a more clear state of mind.

264
00:16:17,939 --> 00:16:18,560
[SPEAKER_04]: So here we go.

265
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,702
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is your advice column about tonight?

266
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,508
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's piece of advice is how to control a runaway camel.

267
00:16:25,688 --> 00:16:30,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, hang on to the reins, but do not pull them back hard enough to stop the camel.

268
00:16:30,669 --> 00:16:33,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Yanking on the reins can tear the camel's nose or break the reins.

269
00:16:34,549 --> 00:16:40,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, if the camel has sturdy reins in the head halter, pull the reins to one side to make the camel run in a circle.

270
00:16:41,671 --> 00:16:45,191
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, hold on until the camel stops.

271
00:16:45,891 --> 00:16:49,112
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether the camel is running in circles or straight, it will not run very far.

272
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:52,677
[SPEAKER_02]: simply hang on until the camel slows and sits down.

273
00:16:53,838 --> 00:16:57,580
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, you know what my final piece of advice always is in these situations?

274
00:16:57,701 --> 00:16:57,961
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

275
00:16:58,281 --> 00:16:59,742
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't get on the fucking camel!

276
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,126
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, don't get on the camel.

277
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,086
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

278
00:17:08,548 --> 00:17:09,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much for that advice.

279
00:17:10,515 --> 00:17:14,196
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to start a new segment here on the Orange Lounge Radio podcast.

280
00:17:14,256 --> 00:17:21,119
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been meaning to get into this for some time, but just recently we've been starting to get a lot of good emails on our feedback address.

281

[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to answer an Orange Lounge Radio feedback email on this podcast right now.

00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:39,305
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to cue up some familiar feedback music here for those of you guys that listen to the three-hour show.

286
00:17:42,339 --> 00:17:45,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's dig into the Orange Lounge radio mailbag.

287
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:54,008
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Ken from New Jersey is writing us, I subscribe to your To Go because I normally don't have time to listen to your regular show all the time.

288
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:55,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Understandable, that's why we created this.

289
00:17:56,129 --> 00:17:59,371
[SPEAKER_04]: And I have an iPod, so I thought this would be the next best thing, and it was.

290
00:18:00,192 --> 00:18:08,038
[SPEAKER_04]: It is good how you talk about games and all, and I enjoy listening to it in the car, but one thing I'm just asking or suggesting, could you guys please talk about music games more?

291
00:18:08,278 --> 00:18:10,980
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you have the name Orange Lounge, but I don't hear much on music games.

292
00:18:11,947 --> 00:18:17,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about upcoming events and things going on with the DDR music game community because I'd really love to hear more about it.

293
00:18:17,772 --> 00:18:18,813
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Ken.

294
00:18:19,414 --> 00:18:20,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you for the email, Ken.

295
00:18:20,775 --> 00:18:21,495
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate that.

296
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,218
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, what can we say on this?

297
00:18:25,282 --> 00:18:30,906
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio was started as a music game, rhythm game, and all that such.

298
00:18:31,947 --> 00:18:34,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything from DDR to Prappa the Rapper, 2DX.

299
00:18:34,788 --> 00:18:36,390
[SPEAKER_04]: Our station was really founded on that.

300
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:44,435
[SPEAKER_04]: But as the station has kind of progressed over the past few years, we've kind of started evolving into wanting to take on the bigger picture.

301
00:18:44,895 --> 00:18:50,019
[SPEAKER_04]: And that is really kind of what we tagline this podcast with, the video games that don't suck.

302
00:18:50,479 --> 00:18:52,861
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't want to be the folks that are talking about, you know...

303
00:18:53,801 --> 00:19:07,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Madden, and not that these games suck, they're respectable games, but we just, we want to speak to those of a different gamer crowd, the ones that aren't, you know, necessarily playing those games that the media is shoving down your throat and everything, so, um,

304
00:19:08,197 --> 00:19:16,886
[SPEAKER_04]: We still have our three-hour talk program on Sunday nights live on OrangeLawnTrader.com, and that is the show that is dedicated still to music games and us as well.

305
00:19:17,226 --> 00:19:23,693
[SPEAKER_04]: And believe me, if there is really big music game news, we're going to mention it on this show because we always do respect DDR.

306
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:29,859
[SPEAKER_04]: We did talk about the DDR with Mario a few episodes ago, you know, in the groove, having a home release and things like that.

307
00:19:30,719 --> 00:19:39,383
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember that DDR itself hasn't had a whole lot of news recently outside of the song packs continuing to come out for Ultramix and things like that.

308
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:48,807
[SPEAKER_04]: But believe me, when we get word of new console releases of DDR, they will be all over this podcast as well as on our three-hour show in more depth.

309
00:19:48,867 --> 00:19:50,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything you want to add to that, DarkSakura?

310
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:53,329
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really only so much we can talk about.

311
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:57,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I played poppin' music yesterday.

312
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:58,151
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

313
00:19:58,491 --> 00:19:58,791
[SPEAKER_02]: You know...

314
00:19:59,457 --> 00:19:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

315
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:18,885
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

316
00:20:19,005 --> 00:20:22,786
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we totally understand your desire to want to hear about music games.

317
00:20:22,826 --> 00:20:26,688
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not trying to, you know, disrespect you or anything because we really, really respect music games.

318
00:20:27,028 --> 00:20:35,971
[SPEAKER_04]: But just understand that the podcast, and this is for everybody out there, the podcast is really something that we're trying to make dedicated more towards those other games that we're into besides Bomani.

319
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:41,432
[SPEAKER_04]: But, of course, we're always, always going to mention, because we're gaming fans first, Bomani fans second, really.

320
00:20:41,933 --> 00:20:42,753
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what this is all about.

321
00:20:44,116 --> 00:20:45,196
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, enough rambling there.

322
00:20:45,236 --> 00:20:52,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if you have an email you want to send to us, togo at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, I didn't ask if you had anything you wanted to add to that, too.

323
00:20:52,479 --> 00:20:53,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, not really.

324
00:20:53,699 --> 00:20:54,739
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we kind of hit on it, right?

325
00:20:54,959 --> 00:20:55,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.

326
00:20:56,040 --> 00:21:02,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a story you had actually posted on the orangeloungeradio.com website where we do talk about a lot of general gaming news.

327
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,723
[SPEAKER_04]: Xbox Next, or, you know, that's kind of the project name right now.

328
00:21:05,763 --> 00:21:07,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also been referred to as Xenon.

329
00:21:07,423 --> 00:21:09,204
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what this is going to be called for sure.

330
00:21:10,524 --> 00:21:12,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the specs is coming out on this.

331
00:21:14,275 --> 00:21:15,115
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

332
00:21:15,155 --> 00:21:17,956
[SPEAKER_04]: You can read the specs on our site, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

333
00:21:20,596 --> 00:21:21,797
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting stuff.

334
00:21:22,357 --> 00:21:26,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Xenon CPU has three 3.0 GHz PowerPC cores.

335
00:21:26,878 --> 00:21:32,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Each core is capable of two instructions per cycle and has an L1 cache with 32 kilobytes for data.

336
00:21:32,399 --> 00:21:33,159
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah, blah, blah.

337
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:34,339
[SPEAKER_04]: All this technical stuff.

338
00:21:34,719 --> 00:21:37,600
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki, can you sum up what this all means here?

339
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,040
[SPEAKER_04]: It means it'll look pretty.

340
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,781
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, basically.

341
00:21:41,321 --> 00:21:41,881
[SPEAKER_03]: More or less.

342
00:21:41,981 --> 00:21:42,721
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll just run.

343
00:21:43,390 --> 00:21:43,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Better.

344
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:49,252
[SPEAKER_03]: What they're basically doing is instead of having one processor dedicated to everything, they're just separating it.

345
00:21:49,753 --> 00:21:51,173
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

346
00:21:52,554 --> 00:21:53,474
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought this was interesting.

347
00:21:53,774 --> 00:21:55,855
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're wanting to build a camera into this.

348
00:21:55,895 --> 00:21:58,316
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that it will have a USB 2.0 camera.

349
00:21:58,356 --> 00:22:02,798
[SPEAKER_04]: It's capable of 1.2 megapixel still shots and VGA videos.

350
00:22:02,878 --> 00:22:05,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Photos can be used in-game for gamer profiles.

351
00:22:05,699 --> 00:22:06,900
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if it's going to be built into it.

352
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:10,841
[SPEAKER_03]: It might be like an attachment that's packaged with it.

353
00:22:10,982 --> 00:22:12,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt they would actually...

354
00:22:12,959 --> 00:22:14,359
[SPEAKER_03]: I listen to people bitching every day about...

355
00:22:40,394 --> 00:22:41,635
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a widescreen!

356
00:22:41,655 --> 00:22:43,736
[SPEAKER_03]: There's bars on top and bottom!

357
00:22:43,816 --> 00:22:44,956
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like it!

358
00:22:45,036 --> 00:22:46,397
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because these people are idiots.

359
00:22:46,457 --> 00:22:48,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they are idiots, but you know what?

360
00:22:48,338 --> 00:22:53,440
[SPEAKER_03]: They make up most of the United States, and that's, sadly enough, that's what people are talking about here.

361
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:01,003
[SPEAKER_03]: These HDTVs are not cheap by any means, and to be honest, I mean, you're really not missing much.

362
00:23:01,623 --> 00:23:02,564
[SPEAKER_03]: You're really not.

363
00:23:03,684 --> 00:23:04,305
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

364
00:23:04,345 --> 00:23:07,486
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, go out, buy the expensive console systems.

365
00:23:07,766 --> 00:23:08,907
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, for example, I...

366
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:15,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I got my CD burner from my computer the very first one.

367
00:23:16,105 --> 00:23:16,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I spent $300 on it.

368
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:16,966
[SPEAKER_03]: $300 on a CD burner.

369
00:23:17,006 --> 00:23:17,726
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess how fast it was?

370
00:23:17,746 --> 00:23:17,926
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 speed.

371
00:23:17,986 --> 00:23:19,407
[SPEAKER_03]: I can buy a 52 speed burner for $50 now.

372
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

373
00:23:27,961 --> 00:23:30,182
[SPEAKER_02]: I sell them at price for $25.

374
00:23:30,343 --> 00:23:30,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, $25.

375
00:23:31,483 --> 00:23:31,984
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example.

376
00:23:32,284 --> 00:23:34,406
[SPEAKER_03]: These TVs, thousands of dollars right now.

377
00:23:34,886 --> 00:23:36,607
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it a year, they'll be not.

378
00:23:36,807 --> 00:23:40,510
[SPEAKER_04]: Just yesterday I was looking at Best Buy, these TVs, and I was thinking, my God, these are so expensive.

379
00:23:40,550 --> 00:23:44,153
[SPEAKER_04]: But by Christmas, I'll bet you that'll be the big thing they try to push this Christmas, is HDTVs.

380
00:23:44,453 --> 00:23:45,374
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll come way down in price.

381
00:23:45,394 --> 00:23:46,635
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone's selling TVs now.

382
00:23:46,695 --> 00:23:48,236
[SPEAKER_03]: Gateway, Dell, that's crazy.

383
00:23:50,361 --> 00:23:57,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, also along the Xbox Next, their next system, they're going to be changing up the dashboard in Xbox Live.

384
00:23:58,172 --> 00:23:59,655
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be built from the ground up.

385
00:23:59,835 --> 00:24:02,058
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like they're going to do a lot more of...

386
00:24:02,992 --> 00:24:05,873
[SPEAKER_04]: These like purchasing these items for use in game.

387
00:24:05,973 --> 00:24:09,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe like pennies at a time, things like this where you're going to be able to buy stuff.

388
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:17,037
[SPEAKER_04]: The new dashboard will have this prominent spot where it will feature slots for both games and also digital media you can buy through the Xbox.

389
00:24:17,177 --> 00:24:18,318
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be very interesting.

390
00:24:18,358 --> 00:24:22,119
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like they might be trying to make this new Xbox a multi-purpose console.

391
00:24:22,659 --> 00:24:23,820
[SPEAKER_04]: Buy movies online?

392
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,481
[SPEAKER_04]: Bet you that's what they're going for.

393
00:24:25,641 --> 00:24:26,181
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see though.

394
00:24:26,321 --> 00:24:29,282
[SPEAKER_03]: Will I be able to hold it up to my head and talk into it like a phone?

395
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:30,991
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

396
00:24:45,155 --> 00:24:49,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of Xbox, you know they had a big game out last year called Fable.

397
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:51,919
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, news coming out this week, let's make it short.

398
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,900
[SPEAKER_04]: It's coming out for the PC as well.

399
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,222
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be called Fable The Lost Chapters.

400
00:24:56,802 --> 00:25:01,945
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course the title would make you think that it's going to have additional content not found in its console counterpart.

401
00:25:02,366 --> 00:25:03,106
[SPEAKER_04]: And that would be correct.

402
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be more quests, more regions, more story.

403
00:25:07,031 --> 00:25:10,574
[SPEAKER_04]: New armor, new weapons, da-da-da, all on your PC.

404
00:25:10,854 --> 00:25:14,877
[SPEAKER_04]: And that story kind of makes sense, because, you know, it was... Fable was pretty cool.

405
00:25:15,317 --> 00:25:16,558
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd actually play it on PC.

406
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:20,221
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten a chance to get really into it, but I think it is the kind of game I would pick up on the PC.

407
00:25:20,301 --> 00:25:26,025
[SPEAKER_04]: And I applaud Microsoft for finally releasing a game like that on the Xbox, because it badly needed it.

408
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:30,348
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they had to program it in where the villagers would eventually kick you out of their town if you stayed too long.

409
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:34,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Because before, you could have actually settled in a village.

410
00:25:36,273 --> 00:25:36,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

411
00:25:37,513 --> 00:25:38,534
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I like about that game?

412
00:25:38,955 --> 00:25:42,558
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the fact that you can be gay, straight, or bi in it.

413
00:25:42,638 --> 00:25:44,220
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can actually date men if you want.

414
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,421
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of funny to me.

415
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

416
00:25:48,483 --> 00:25:50,005
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like The Sims all over again.

417
00:25:52,335 --> 00:25:55,197
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be a tour going around U.S.

418
00:25:55,277 --> 00:25:56,959
[SPEAKER_04]: colleges in March and April.

419
00:25:57,019 --> 00:25:58,480
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be touring 25 U.S.

420
00:25:58,520 --> 00:25:58,980
[SPEAKER_04]: campuses.

421
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,602
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called Game Live.

422
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:07,187
[SPEAKER_04]: And basically, they're going to be bringing a ton of Xbox consoles, plasma, and high-definition televisions to all these colleges.

423
00:26:07,888 --> 00:26:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: California, Georgia, Michigan, Iowa, Washington, all these places.

424
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,994
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, it's just an expo to try and get college kids to get sucked into these games.

425
00:26:16,014 --> 00:26:17,215
[SPEAKER_04]: So they'll buy them, basically.

426
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:20,558
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want more information on this, visit the official website.

427
00:26:20,598 --> 00:26:21,098
[SPEAKER_04]: It's www.

428
00:26:22,079 --> 00:26:25,741
[SPEAKER_04]: GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com

429
00:26:48,737 --> 00:26:49,898
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true, but it wasn't enough.

430
00:26:50,458 --> 00:26:52,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't a Legend of Zelda.

431
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:53,901
[SPEAKER_02]: It had Buffy.

432
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:58,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but it did not have Katamari Damacy.

433
00:26:58,564 --> 00:26:59,065
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

434
00:26:59,265 --> 00:27:00,806
[SPEAKER_04]: It still does not have Katamari Damacy.

435
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,147
[SPEAKER_04]: Something to think about.

436
00:27:03,771 --> 00:27:06,936
[SPEAKER_04]: One more story for you guys, and we're going to call it a podcast.

437
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:13,685
[SPEAKER_04]: GDC, there was a panel at the GDC, and it was studying the female gamer.

438
00:27:13,785 --> 00:27:18,933
[SPEAKER_04]: It was called, in particular, Counting Women, the Dollars and Cents Behind Female Gamers.

439
00:27:19,571 --> 00:27:20,651
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:27:48,874 --> 00:27:52,575
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't put everybody in a certain bin, but, you know, kind of the big picture.

441
00:27:52,875 --> 00:27:53,355
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?

442
00:27:54,256 --> 00:27:54,816
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they need?

443
00:27:55,076 --> 00:27:58,337
[SPEAKER_04]: In your opinion, as a gamer girl, what do they need to do to get more women to play?

444
00:27:58,357 --> 00:28:02,738
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have more prissy frou-frou games, I guess, because I don't know.

445
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:03,599
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, come on.

446
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Surely you can't suggest that we're going to have Barbie dress up.

447
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,201
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm not really a typical woman.

448
00:28:12,221 --> 00:28:15,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not into stupid girly bullshit, you know?

449
00:28:15,942 --> 00:28:17,863
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think for myself...

450
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:27,208
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch TV at all.

451
00:28:27,769 --> 00:28:31,411
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go off drooling over whoever this cute actor is.

452
00:28:31,451 --> 00:28:35,374
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'll think he's attractive, but I won't have obsessions about somebody.

453
00:28:35,834 --> 00:28:40,997
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Orlando Bloom, oh my poor thighs or something.

454
00:28:43,799 --> 00:28:46,541
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Orlando Bloom does not give me the screaming thigh sweats.

455
00:28:47,552 --> 00:28:57,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Another interesting, and tell me what you think about this, DarkSakura, an interesting thing here, suggesting that the popularity of the eye toy, which sold, you know, well over 3 million units in 2004.

456
00:29:00,385 --> 00:29:04,769
[SPEAKER_04]: They're saying that was largely due to the female market and its attraction to the device.

457
00:29:05,209 --> 00:29:05,749
[SPEAKER_04]: You think so?

458
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:08,672
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, I always thought thy toy was pretty stupid.

459
00:29:09,212 --> 00:29:11,694
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that because women like to look at themselves?

460
00:29:13,495 --> 00:29:18,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I really do not, I guess, think like the typical woman does.

461
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,601
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's why we love you.

462
00:29:20,861 --> 00:29:24,464
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of the things that just disgust me in general.

463
00:29:25,685 --> 00:29:26,666
[SPEAKER_02]: I can understand...

464
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:29,480
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing girly things.

465
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:30,781
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my girly moments.

466
00:29:30,901 --> 00:29:33,464
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people who were like that all the damn time.

467
00:29:34,184 --> 00:29:36,126
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my friend's sister.

468
00:29:37,587 --> 00:29:43,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Who was such an expert at Mac makeup by herself that they let her work at the counter.

469
00:29:44,793 --> 00:29:45,955
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm not kidding either.

470
00:29:46,575 --> 00:29:48,657
[SPEAKER_02]: She has a room dedicated to her makeup.

471
00:29:50,118 --> 00:29:53,101
[SPEAKER_04]: I know guys that could sadly probably run that counter as well.

472
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:54,362
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

473
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:57,392
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

474
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:18,743
[SPEAKER_02]: are more attractive overall because, you know, especially things with customizable things.

475
00:30:19,163 --> 00:30:29,850
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do have to say that my whole fascination with wrestling games is customizing the characters and making my own wrestlers and stuff and making them as violent and bloody as possible and designing their outfits while I'm at it.

476
00:30:30,811 --> 00:30:31,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a little girly.

477
00:30:31,932 --> 00:30:36,895
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did kind of screw up my room on Final Fantasy, my mod house on Final Fantasy XI because I wanted to decorate it.

478
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:39,777
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's, I have elements stylish.

479
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:41,859
So...

480
00:30:43,557 --> 00:30:46,620
[SPEAKER_04]: and I can't wait to see your house in Animal Crossing DS, might I say.

481
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,642
[SPEAKER_02]: You saw my house on Animal Crossing.

482
00:30:48,742 --> 00:30:49,002
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.

483
00:30:49,142 --> 00:30:52,526
[SPEAKER_02]: I had the shrine to fire downstairs.

484
00:30:52,826 --> 00:30:53,206
[SPEAKER_04]: You did.

485
00:30:53,526 --> 00:30:54,507
[SPEAKER_04]: That was hilarious.

486
00:30:54,828 --> 00:30:56,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Jamie's house in Animal Crossing?

487
00:30:56,329 --> 00:31:03,696
[SPEAKER_04]: You would go downstairs and then she had like the music playing and there was just this huge campfire, like huge bonfire.

488
00:31:04,056 --> 00:31:07,559
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of the Japanese artifacts in my downstairs room.

489
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,501
[SPEAKER_02]: My upstairs room was like colonial.

490
00:31:10,390 --> 00:31:13,812
[SPEAKER_02]: and downstairs I had my bonsai collection.

491
00:31:13,852 --> 00:31:14,932
[SPEAKER_02]: I had every bonsai.

492
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:15,993
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a lot of the instruments.

493
00:31:16,013 --> 00:31:16,933
[SPEAKER_02]: I had taiko drums.

494
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:17,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them.

495
00:31:18,734 --> 00:31:29,899
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the background a little CD player going... And I had the bonfire in the middle of my room there.

496
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:31,160
[SPEAKER_02]: Dan had an arcade.

497
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,481
[SPEAKER_04]: See, Animal Crossing is a good girl game, I think.

498
00:31:33,781 --> 00:31:34,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it is.

499
00:31:34,282 --> 00:31:36,143
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one of mine and Dan's friends...

500
00:31:40,103 --> 00:31:46,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Tina, she maintains our village that we don't play with anymore.

501
00:31:47,306 --> 00:31:47,827
[SPEAKER_04]: That's nice.

502
00:31:47,907 --> 00:31:48,307
[SPEAKER_04]: That's good.

503
00:31:49,787 --> 00:31:53,909
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't think that I'm representative of the female market.

504
00:31:56,190 --> 00:31:57,311
[SPEAKER_04]: You're the best we could find.

505
00:31:58,331 --> 00:31:59,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm teasing.

506
00:32:01,193 --> 00:32:03,994
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the one who was begging for the whole Silent Hill collection.

507
00:32:04,794 --> 00:32:08,436
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do think that they would have more success with doing...

508
00:32:09,233 --> 00:32:19,978
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think that, and this is just in dealing with people that I know, a lot of the friends that I hang out with are a good bit more intelligent than the average American.

509
00:32:20,859 --> 00:32:24,901
[SPEAKER_02]: So they enjoy challenging games, puzzles, things that make you think.

510
00:32:25,701 --> 00:32:32,444
[SPEAKER_02]: But the average person in this country isn't going to want too much of a challenge because they can't handle it.

511
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:35,406
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to want something where...

512
00:32:37,009 --> 00:32:42,011
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly think a sim is the best thing, I think, for the typical female.

513
00:32:42,592 --> 00:32:42,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

514
00:32:43,272 --> 00:32:44,192
[SPEAKER_02]: And the party games.

515
00:32:45,293 --> 00:32:45,753
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

516
00:32:46,033 --> 00:32:49,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Advice from our own female perspective there.

517
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:50,055
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?

518
00:32:50,115 --> 00:32:51,215
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me more Silent Hill.

519
00:32:51,275 --> 00:32:54,957
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't even have to pay $200 to attend a one-day conference to hear it, so there you go.

520
00:32:55,177 --> 00:32:55,817
[SPEAKER_04]: You got it for free.

521
00:32:56,618 --> 00:32:57,798
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we gotta wrap it up.

522
00:32:58,238 --> 00:32:59,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Final thoughts, times, Loki.

523
00:33:00,719 --> 00:33:05,782
[SPEAKER_03]: It would be awesome if they put Martha Stewart as the playable character in Postal 3.

524
00:33:07,017 --> 00:33:09,838
[SPEAKER_03]: Because she's so hardcore now that she's gotten out of jail.

525
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:18,582
[SPEAKER_04]: My final thought is, don't forget, we're going to be accepting submissions for the Kickin' Ultracade Machine Gallery that's going to be on our site soon.

526
00:33:19,162 --> 00:33:19,583
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.

527
00:33:20,243 --> 00:33:21,263
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't ride a camel!
