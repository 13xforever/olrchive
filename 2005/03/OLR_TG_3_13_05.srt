00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:34,480
that don't suck and well some that do because it just sneaks in there sometimes.

7
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:38,720
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, my awesome

8
00:00:38,720 --> 00:00:43,460
co-hosts, say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:45,460
Sakura.

10
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:46,460
Sakura.

11
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:47,460
Sa.

12
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:48,460
Sa.

13
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:49,460
Hi.

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,660
Say hello also to Loki.

15
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:57,180
I am referred to as a tsunami to these gummy bears.

16
00:00:57,180 --> 00:00:58,500
How so?

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,400
Because I've already eaten so many of them and taken their lives.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,120
I see.

19
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,620
Three pounds down since last week.

20
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,460
That's a lot of gummy.

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,180
Have you thrown up gummy yet?

22
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:11,180
Nope.

23
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,180
Alright.

24
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,180
Alright.

25
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,520
Um, let's get into it.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,640
What kind of games you guys been playing this week?

27
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,700
Dark Sakura.

28
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:23,700
I played a little Final Fantasy XI, like maybe for 10 minutes.

29
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:27,700
I don't know, I did some significant play earlier in the week.

30
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:31,700
Lots of Tekken 5. Got to see all the endings now.

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,700
Ganryu's ending is hilarious.

32
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:38,700
That's really it.

33
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,700
Alright, so a little more Tekken 5 for Dark Sagra.

34
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,700
Jamie! Or, sorry, Loki!

35
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:52,700
Parodius, I've played that for a little bit on the main cabinet, and the rest of the week

36
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:59,100
was just Final Fantasy XI. Lots and lots of Final Fantasy XI.

37
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,940
Same old theme going on. Why Parodius?

38
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,740
I don't know. Why not? I played Aliens vs. Predator last week, and I'll play probably

39
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:11,260
another game, because I have to get my money's worth out of this cabinet. And to put it this

40
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:15,140
way, that's $3,000 worth of quarters.

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:20,280
Alright, I decided to treat myself to some new video games this week, so I went out shopping

42
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:23,800
the other day and I picked up a copy of Zelda Minish Cap, because I've been meaning to get

43
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,280
that for a long time, so I have that for my DS now.

44
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,160
And yes, I know that Minish Cap is a Game Boy Advance game, but you know what?

45
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:35,580
My DS is my Game Boy Advance right now, because it doesn't need up batteries like the Game

46
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,880
Boy Advance does, because you just plug it in and all that.

47
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,780
So I'm loving the Minish Cap right now, I think it's a great game.

48
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:49,360
I love the 16-bit Zelda game, of course, Link to the Past, so I think that Minish Cap kind

49
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,640
of invokes a lot of that old stuff, but the cool thing is, they take a lot from like Ocarina

50
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,040
of Time, like they take a lot of the music, they take some of the new enemies that were

51
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,520
in there like the Deku nuts and stuff like that, they show up but in 16-bit form, and

52
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,520
I just think that's so cool.

53
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,440
And I like the puzzle element of turning small and all that stuff.

54
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,440
Pretty good game.

55
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,320
I also picked up, because it was only $10, because it's kind of an older game now, but

56
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:15,400
picked up a copy of Phantasy Star online on the Xbox because I guess we just

57
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,200
needed a new MMO to talk about on this program and I know Jamie used to play

58
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:29,320
PSO a long time ago but you stopped right. I think I just hit V-Hard so if you want help leveling I've got

59
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:34,560
people who will help you level. Okay. I mean and we've got stuff for you we have Al

60
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,560
I'll wrap these, which you're not supposed to have, oooh.

61
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,560
Alright, sounds good, maybe, maybe.

62
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,560
So, I just, I kinda liked Phantasy Star Online because it reminds me of a 3D Diablo.

63
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:47,560
That's kinda why I like that game, so, I don't know.

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,560
You know, I thought about playing it again because I actually do have it for the Dreamcast,

65
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,560
but I gotta cheat, because that's what I do.

66
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,560
That's the only way you can play games, is to cheat.

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Don't you think that cheating in MMORPGs is unethical?

68
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,560
Nope.

69
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,860
Alright, well, we'll start off some gaming news tonight with some news about an MMORPG blizzard

70
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,440
Said they were gonna do this for a long time. They finally did it they closed over

71
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,880
1,000 accounts related to gold farming on World of Warcraft and

72
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:17,320
character sales

73
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,880
Blizzard says over the recent weeks

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,080
We've been investigating the activities of certain individuals who have been farming gold in order to sell it in exchange for real-world currency

75
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:29,580
currency. After researching the situation, we have issued permanent suspensions to over

76
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,320
1,000 accounts that have been engaging in this practice. We do not condone such actions

77
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,720
and will take decisive action as they are against our policy and damage the game economy

78
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:43,760
as a whole. 1,000 World of Warcraft players get in the boot, which should hopefully speed

79
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:47,600
up some of those servers. So, I don't know. What do you think about this? Loki, I know

80
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,840
you have a strong opinion on buying stuff in-game with real money.

81
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,520
I don't have a problem with it, but I think it's a good idea, you know, why not?

82
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,940
That Square Enix is always threatening, oh, we're gonna do something!

83
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:01,440
You watch, one of these days we're gonna do something!

84
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,560
Well, didn't they ban, like, 700 people?

85
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,200
But that was more for harassing players, right?

86
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:12,540
No, it wasn't 700 people, it was 80 people, 80 people, 80, over, and this is over, like,

87
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,540
you know, what, 24 servers?

88
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,420
No, wait a minute, I thought it was, like, 800, and then when you went across the number

89
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,920
of servers there were it was like maybe 20 people a server or something no it

90
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:26,020
wasn't anything weird and all the guild sellers are still there oh yeah

91
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:33,020
interesting and and and they're they're you know raising the auction house taxes

92
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:39,020
because that would stop inflation has done nothing it's like they have no idea

93
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:44,220
how to control their own damn game dark Sakura any opinion you have on buying

94
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,680
and selling? I wouldn't do it, honestly. I'd just make- I'd just, you know, be all cute

95
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,000
in-game and have people, oh I feel sorry for you, here's money. So you would like

96
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,280
to be the equivalent of an MMO bum, or you just, you know- No. I- I'm actually- I'm

97
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,560
actually going to stop selling my crystals so that I can make lumber and

98
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,840
give people wood. There you go. You know, I was thinking, um, you know, if you got

99
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:15,640
desperate you could start turning tricks and MMOs for you know DeNiro but that's

100
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:19,240
what's already going on in Sims Online from what I understand is that Sims

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:23,440
Online just turned into a giant Vegas so that's why nobody's really playing it.

102
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:28,960
They don't have emotes for that yet in Final Fantasy 11. What? Turning tricks? Yeah. Just you wait.

103
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,240
Slash pizza was only the beginning for these MMOs. All right also in gaming news

104
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,080
of course the game developers conference was this week so a lot a lot of news

105
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:43,360
coming out all the big three are starting to tease stuff going on with

106
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,800
their systems Nintendo I think dropped a hell of a bombshell although this is

107
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,320
interesting because if you go back and you listen up a couple podcasts ago we

108
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:54,720
were talking about this exact same thing and sure enough here it is it's coming

109
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,520
true they've announced that the next console the revolution console is going

110
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:03,440
to have Wi-Fi and I swear I could swear this was just last week when I was saying

111
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,680
it would connect to your DS via Wi-Fi they would be stupid not to put it in

112
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,440
This was months ago that we've announced this. There was months ago that this was going to happen. Also months ago

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:18,000
I mean well we speculated it, but now it's official. Oh come on. We knew this was going to happen

114
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,520
I'm just saying there's a thin line you got to draw there, so

115
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:28,520
Certainly no big surprise there, but here's the other interesting part again. We've been speculating this for quite some time now

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,560
Nintendo's announced that the DS's are going to be going online

117
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,880
online. So just like you go into a Starbucks and you have a Wi-Fi hotspot

118
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,920
type place, even if you have a hotspot in your house with Wi-Fi,

119
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,800
now your DS can get on the internet. But I thought those spots you had to pay for

120
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,600
or you had to have like some sort of password to get into them. Well Nintendo, now we don't know the

121
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,840
details on this yet so maybe this could change

122
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:54,440
but Nintendo is saying right now this is going to be a free service

123
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:57,500
and you know what if it's just using the internet that's already there, hey.

124
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,240
Guess who's got Wi-Fi at home? There you go. So you're going to be able to use the DS on the internet.

125
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:13,240
Very first game that's gonna support this, Animal Crossing DS, which makes a lot of fanboys and girls of that game very happy because a lot of people have been saying since that game first came out,

126
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:24,240
I should be online, forget, and we were all in Animal Crossing, I know all three of us were really all up on that game when it first came out. Loki of course was cheating on it to the best of his ability.

127
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:32,380
I was only utilizing an error that they made in their game programming okay I did not use

128
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:38,100
any sort of codes I just found a way to duplicate items okay I remember like hey Jamie you're

129
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:41,420
going out of town let me borrow your village so I can get your villagers to say shit and

130
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:49,260
fuck that's right I remember that and I remember I was so mad with my town lesbian left that's

131
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:55,620
right what was her name olivia no olivia was the pretty white cat there's oh man i don't

132
00:08:55,620 --> 00:09:01,660
know but um remember i even made made the sign to hang outside of her house i loved

133
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,180
how you can make the signs on it i loved how you can make the signs i'm just gonna be scared

134
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,420
because you're gonna have people vandalizing your towns and shit this is gonna be crazy

135
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:15,460
you're gonna have like you're gonna have animal crossing gangs i am kidding you not they're

136
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:20,380
They're going to be flashing their gang colors, and there's going to be gang signs.

137
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,540
People are going to get tagged.

138
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,540
I would think...

139
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,160
You're going to get hackers out there?

140
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:25,160
It's crazy.

141
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,980
I would think, and I would hope that Nintendo is already one step ahead of you in the planning

142
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,100
of this game, and they'll make it, because Nintendo's always been a very family-friendly

143
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,100
thing.

144
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:38,640
So they don't want any old person going into some seven-year-old's village and starting

145
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,720
to make the townspeople say, you know, fuck me silly, you know, things like that.

146
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,040
So I would think that there's going to be something set up where you will have to grant

147
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,020
permission to only trusted individuals to enter your town.

148
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,020
I would imagine.

149
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,020
Yeah.

150
00:09:52,020 --> 00:10:00,480
Loki's screen name is going to be Free Candy Jesus Juice.

151
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,960
Do you remember what my island was called?

152
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,680
I think it was like Big Tits or something.

153
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,680
Yeah.

154
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:09,080
And what was it like, God, what was my town called?

155
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:10,760
It was like something cock.

156
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,280
It was like Big Cock or Monster Cock or something.

157
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,280
Big Cock, yes.

158
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:21,880
And, and, note the great thing, though, is I am going to take, you know, and shrink it

159
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:28,000
down to, you know, the pixel size goat's aim, and I'm going to put it all over the place.

160
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Oh god, get a life.

161
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
Get a life.

162
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,080
It'll be fun!

163
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:33,160
You will be denied access to my village.

164
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,920
But this is, this is just going to, I, I can't even think of the implications this game is

165
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
going to have.

166
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:45,080
be a very exciting thing I think. I can. I'll be bored. This game is coming out the day

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,480
after my birthday, or it's coming out the same week. Do you think that this was done

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:54,900
to kind of one-up the PSP right before its launch date? PSP said it's going to be online,

169
00:10:54,900 --> 00:11:00,200
but honestly, I think we're going to see the PSP is pretty much just Xbox Live. It's been

170
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,440
like this whole thing DS vs PSP has been like this big cock-waving competition where it's

171
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,820
like oh yeah well the DS is gonna come out first whack oh yeah well the PSP is

172
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,620
gonna show movies whack oh yeah well the DS is gonna be online whack oh yeah so

173
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:19,500
it's a PSP whack it's just you know continuing you know yeah but where

174
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:26,180
there's going to be 18 titles for launch on the PSP if that's 15 or 18 Nintendo

175
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:30,540
is only coming out with like one game I know that's really DS's weakness but

176
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:35,860
Nintendo they've always been good at this when their game comes out their

177
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:41,660
game is just oh we're also though they're doing and then we're gonna do

178
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:45,980
the Game Boy Advance 2 or SP 2 or whatever no Game Boy Advance 2 and it's

179
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:52,900
because the DS isn't the adult system it's being marketed in Japan as the

180
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:58,220
system for adults I wouldn't get that impression that says maybe in Japan but

181
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:04,700
here because he knows you know zookeeper whoo that's an adult title hey actually

182
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:08,540
since it's basically just a ripoff of bejeweled I see tons of people that I

183
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,060
work with wasting their day away playing bejeweled instead of working my dad so

184
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,620
so they think about slaggers all right um speaking of Nintendo they always have

185
00:12:18,620 --> 00:12:24,380
that one game that comes out that makes you have to buy their system so dark

186
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:27,660
Sakura if you have a moment I'd like you to come over if you can bring your

187
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:32,720
microphone because Dark Sakura is probably the only gamer on the planet

188
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,100
that has not seen this this week yet it's the brand new Zelda trailer from

189
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,060
the GDC so I'm gonna give a running commentary of what's going on the

190
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:45,260
trailer and we're gonna get Jamie's live reaction so here is the brand new Zelda

191
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,780
trailer which I know doesn't make for great radio it maybe it'll help you

192
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:54,120
relive some memories here so here it is so of course it starts off rating

193
00:12:54,120 --> 00:13:03,100
pending. Legend of Zelda. There's Link looking all manly and swimming around in a very nice

194
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:12,120
looking water scene. And then just some lighting. No. And then Link saving a kitty. He has kitties!

195
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:18,120
And then just a very scary statue thing. Some more fighting at night. And then Link riding

196
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:21,760
a horse. Look at how great this looks. And some like boar looking creatures in the game

197
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:22,760
Is it Epona?

198
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,520
It wasn't Epona, was it?

199
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:26,520
It might have been.

200
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:31,240
It's the morons.

201
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:36,840
And then the skeleton creatures.

202
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,660
And then some more fighting in the underground.

203
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,560
Some scary ghost creatures.

204
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:44,120
I swear this is just like Ocarina.

205
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:47,200
Yeah, but it's like way better looking.

206
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:54,780
And look at this, riding the horse and fighting at the same time, fighting creatures.

207
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:00,300
And then of course Goma shows up in every game.

208
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,180
Some more fighting.

209
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,140
And then there he is riding one of those boar-type creatures, just some fighting with a kind

210
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:13,300
of interesting freeze when he hits something and then of course the wolf thing at the end.

211
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,300
So that's the new Zelda trailer.

212
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:22,900
There's a lot that they took from Wind Waker as well, so I noticed a lot of that stuff

213
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,980
too that they have adapted from it.

214
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,460
This is the game they should have put out instead of Wind Waker.

215
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,460
It is!

216
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:29,460
That's what I've been saying.

217
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,780
Wind Waker wasn't a bad game though.

218
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:37,260
It wasn't bad, but you know, it just wasn't that, I mean my god, it's like Nintendo's

219
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,740
been having their ace in the hole for this whole time, because you remember that old

220
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:45,940
demo that showed Zelda running on the G and it was like a real-life Zelda it's

221
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:50,100
probably what that's turned into is this game it's beautiful so you got to see

222
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:54,980
that for the first time would you think exactly that was my reaction to and I'm

223
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:58,300
sure a lot of folks those you guys that want to download the trailer for

224
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,460
yourself tons of gaming sites out there have it just look around on some of the

225
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,460
big ones you will not have a problem finding that trust me all right um let's

226
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:11,060
talk about one other console real fast Sony PlayStation 3 rumor is they're

227
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:17,140
gonna show it next week but we didn't see anything yet who knows but we will

228
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:22,500
be seeing it for sure at e3 in LA later on this year so that's all we know so

229
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,660
far about what's going on with PlayStation 3 so they're kind of whereas

230
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:29,740
Nintendo and Xbox are kind of showing off what they've got we'll talk about

231
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,340
Xbox a little bit PlayStation 3's keeping some of it to see they've taught

232
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:38,660
you you've heard some of it but no he's got a lot under the hood that's what

233
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:43,060
I've been hearing a lot of time. I think I think they're basically keeping it under wraps

234
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,940
And then you know Xbox look at what we can do in the ps3. It's like yeah, but look at this

235
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,820
Booyah served

236
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,860
All right

237
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,860
We're gonna get to a segment

238
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:58,280
Called what do we have a name for this? I don't know, but dark Sakura

239
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:04,220
Oh, yes, dark Sakura's advice column and dark Sakura is gonna better your life with some advice and

240
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:10,100
Yes, very usable advice and if you're feeling a little, you know, tingly after

241
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,940
thinking about that Zelda trailer all over again, here's some

242
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:18,700
of Dark Sakura's advice to put you in a more clear state of mind. So here we go.

243
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:23,100
And what is your advice column about tonight? Today's piece of advice is how to

244
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,540
control a runaway camel.

245
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,200
Number one, hang on to the reins but do not pull them back hard enough to stop the camel.

246
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,420
Yanking on the reins can tear the camel's nose or break the reins.

247
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:41,420
2. If the camel has sturdy reins and a head halter, pull the reins to one side to make the camel run in a circle.

248
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:53,420
3. Hold on until the camel stops. Whether the camel is running in circles or straight, it will not run very far. Simply hang on until the camel slows and sits down.

249
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,560
Of course, you know what my final piece of advice always is in these situations?

250
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,060
What?

251
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:00,060
Don't get on the fucking camel!

252
00:17:03,260 --> 00:17:05,980
Yeah, don't get on the camel. All right.

253
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,160
Thank you very much for that advice.

254
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:16,640
We're gonna start a new segment here on the Orange Lounge Radio Podcast and we've been meaning to get into this for some time,

255
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,060
but just recently we've been starting to get a lot of good emails on our feedback address.

256
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:25,980
it's to go at orange lounge radio.com so if you want you can send us an email

257
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,180
there and it's our mailbag so we're gonna answer an orange lounge radio

258
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,780
feedback email on this podcast right now so we're gonna queue up some familiar

259
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:42,300
feedback music here for those of you guys listen to the three-hour show all

260
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:47,340
right let's dig into the orange lounge radio mailbag all right I can from New

261
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:52,260
Jersey is writing us I subscribe to you to go because I normally don't have time

262
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:55,180
to listen to your regular show all the time understandable that's why we

263
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:58,500
created this and I have an iPod so I thought this would be the next best

264
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:02,460
thing and it was it is good how you talk about games and all and I enjoy

265
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,940
listening to it in the car but one thing I'm just asking or suggesting could you

266
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,420
guys please talk about music games more I see you have the name orange lounge

267
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,380
but I don't hear much on music games talk about upcoming events and things

268
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:16,440
going on with the DDR or music game community because I'd really love to

269
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:21,520
to hear more about it. Thanks, Ken. Well, thank you for the email, Ken. We appreciate

270
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:27,440
that. Um, wow, what can we say on this? You know, Orange Lounge Radio was started as a

271
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:33,240
music game, rhythm game, and all that such, um, you know, everything from DDR to Parappa

272
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:38,680
the Rappa, 2DX, our station was really founded on that. Um, but, you know, as the station

273
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:43,240
has kind of progressed over the past few years, we've kind of started evolving into wanting

274
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,600
to take on the bigger picture and that is really kind of what we tagline this

275
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,600
podcast with the video games that don't suck we don't want to be the folks that

276
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:55,840
are talking about you know Madden and not that these games suck they're

277
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,240
respectable games but we just we want to speak to those of a different gamer

278
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:04,440
crowd the ones that aren't you know necessarily playing those games that the

279
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:09,040
media is shoving down your throat and everything so we still have our three

280
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:12,720
hour talk program on Sunday nights live on orange laundry to calm and that is

281
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,400
the show that is dedicated still to music games and us as well. And believe me, if there

282
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,280
is really big music game news, we're going to mention it on this show, because we always

283
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,800
do respect DDR. We did talk about the DDR with Mario a few episodes ago, you know, In

284
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:32,960
the Groove having a home release and things like that. Remember that DDR hasn't had, DDR

285
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:37,720
itself hasn't had a whole lot of news recently, outside of the song packs continuing to come

286
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:43,640
out for Ultramix and things like that. But believe me, when we get word of new console

287
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:48,160
releases of DDR, they will be all over this podcast, as well as on our three hour show

288
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:50,800
in more depth. Anything you want to add to that, DarkSakura?

289
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:57,320
There's really only so much we can talk about. Well, I played Poppin' music yesterday.

290
00:19:57,320 --> 00:20:04,600
Right. You know, there really isn't much new to come out, and honestly, our listeners are

291
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:10,920
into, we are not, as far as video games go, we are not just Bimani fans too. We love our

292
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,720
games. You know, and if anything new happens to happen, of course we're going to cover

293
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:19,000
it, but it would be nice if something new would happen.

294
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,000
So, you know, we totally understand your desire to want to hear about music games. We're not

295
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:27,140
trying to, you know, disrespect you or anything, because we really, really respect music games.

296
00:20:27,140 --> 00:20:30,320
But just understand that the podcast, and this is for everybody out there, the podcast

297
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,320
This is really something that we're trying to make dedicated more towards those other

298
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,160
games that we're into besides Bomani, but of course we're always, always going to mention

299
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:42,060
because we're gaming fans first, Bomani fans second, really.

300
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,060
That's what this is all about.

301
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,280
So, anyway, enough rambling there.

302
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:49,320
Again, if you have an email you want to send to us, togoatorangeloungeradio.com.

303
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,480
Loki, I didn't ask if you had anything you want to add to that, too.

304
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:53,480
Nah, not really.

305
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,880
I guess we kind of hit on it, right?

306
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
Yeah, pretty much.

307
00:20:55,880 --> 00:21:00,000
Well, here's a story you had actually posted on the orangeloungeradio.com website where

308
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,320
where we do talk about a lot of general gaming news.

309
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,400
Xbox Next, or you know,

310
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,800
that's kind of the project name right now,

311
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,440
it's also been referred to as Xenon,

312
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,480
who knows what this is gonna be called for sure.

313
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,680
Some of the specs is coming out on this.

314
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,760
Very interesting, you can read the specs on our site,

315
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:18,260
orangeonsradio.com.

316
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,360
Very interesting stuff.

317
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:26,860
Xenon CPU has three 3.0 gigahertz PowerPC cores.

318
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:29,080
Each core is capable of two instructions per cycle

319
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,420
and has an L1 cache with 32 kilobytes for data,

320
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,680
blah, blah, blah, all this technical stuff.

321
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:38,020
Loki, can you sum up what this all means here?

322
00:21:38,020 --> 00:21:39,960
Means it'll look pretty.

323
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,320
I guess, basically.

324
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,680
More or less, it'll just run better.

325
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,240
What they're basically doing is,

326
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:48,280
instead of having one processor dedicate everything,

327
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:49,740
they're just separating it.

328
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,580
I thought this was interesting.

329
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,560
They're taking it into a Mac.

330
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,760
I thought this was interesting.

331
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,960
It sounds like they're wanting to build a camera into this.

332
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:58,380
They're saying that it will have a USB 2.0 camera.

333
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:04,580
capable of 1.2 megapixel still shots and VGA videos. Photos can be used in game for gamer

334
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,580
profiles.

335
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,260
I don't know if it's going to be built into it. It might be an attachment that's packaged

336
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,620
with it. I doubt they would actually put a camera in the system. That'd be a little weird.

337
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:19,100
You know, a lot of what they've been talking about in their GDC thing this week is they've

338
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:24,620
been using the HD era term. It sounds to me like they're really going to market this next

339
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:28,260
system to really be for those people that are jumping to the next level and getting

340
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:34,300
those HDTVs and kind of that, you know, next level of, I guess, pictures and television

341
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,300
watches.

342
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:39,220
Yeah, honestly, do you really need widescreen? I have, I listen to people bitching every

343
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:45,020
day about, eh, widescreen, there's bars on top and bottom, I don't like it!

344
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:46,420
That's because people are idiots.

345
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:51,140
Yes, they are idiots, but you know what? They make up most of the United States, and that's,

346
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:55,940
And sadly enough, that's what kind of people are talking about here, these HDTVs are not

347
00:22:55,940 --> 00:23:01,780
cheap by any means, and to be honest, I mean, you're really not missing much.

348
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,820
You're really not.

349
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,500
But you know what, hey, go out and buy the expensive console systems, you know, for example,

350
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:15,240
to be exact with this, I remember when I got my CD burner from my computer, the very first

351
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:16,240
one.

352
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,740
I spent $300 on it.

353
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:19,300
$300 on a CD burner!

354
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:26,180
how fast it was four speed I can buy a 52 speed burner for 50 bucks now

355
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:32,380
perfect example I see these fries for $25 okay $25 a perfect example these

356
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:36,980
TVs thousands of dollars right now yeah I'll give it a year they'll be not just

357
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,100
yesterday I was looking at Best Buy at these TVs I'll say my god these are so

358
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:42,660
expensive but by Christmas I'll bet you that'll be the big thing they try to

359
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:45,660
push this Christmas this HD TVs and they'll come way down and everyone's

360
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:54,620
selling TVs now. Gateway, Dell, that's crazy. Anyway, also along the Xbox next, their next

361
00:23:54,620 --> 00:23:58,780
system, they're going to be changing up the dashboard in Xbox Live. It's going to be built

362
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:04,020
from the ground up. It sounds like they're going to do a lot more of these, like, purchasing

363
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,180
these items for use in-game. Maybe, like, pennies at a time, things like this where

364
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,860
you're going to be able to buy stuff. The new dashboard will have this prominent spot

365
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:16,460
where it will feature slots for both games, and also digital media you can buy through

366
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:19,380
the Xbox. That should be very interesting. So it sounds like they might be trying to

367
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:24,940
make this new Xbox a multi-purpose console. Buy movies online? Betcha that's what they're

368
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:28,600
going for. We'll see though. Will I be able to hold it up to my head and talk into it

369
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:34,480
like a phone? No, what you want to know is, can you install Linux on it? Well, that's

370
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:39,100
a yes, because you can install Linux on everything. In fact, today I was just reading online you

371
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:45,700
installed Linux onto a GBA surprise surprise it's coming alright speaking of

372
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:50,540
Xbox you know they had a big game out last year called fable well news coming

373
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:54,140
out this week let's make it short it's coming out for the PC as well and it's

374
00:24:54,140 --> 00:24:58,220
gonna be called fable the lost chapters and of course the title would make you

375
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:01,360
think that it's gonna have additional content not found in its console

376
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,700
counterpart and that would be correct there's gonna be more quests more

377
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:11,040
regions more story new armor new weapons that that are all on your PC and that

378
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:15,620
story kind of makes sense because you know it was pretty cool I'd actually

379
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,820
play it on PC I haven't gotten a chance to get really into it but I think it is

380
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:22,780
the kind of game I would pick up on the PC and I applaud Microsoft for finally

381
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,640
releasing a game like that on the Xbox because it badly needed it they had to

382
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:29,680
program it in where the villagers would eventually kick you out of their town if

383
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:32,820
you stay too long I just like because you could eat before you could have

384
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:38,700
actually settled in a village huh I like you know what I like about that game is

385
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:43,100
the fact that you can be a gay straighter bi in it and you can like

386
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:48,580
actually date men if you want that's kind of funny to me all right um it's

387
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:55,160
like the Sims all over again there's going to be a tour going around US

388
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:59,380
colleges in March and April it's gonna be touring 25 US campuses it's called

389
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:04,660
game live and basically they're gonna be bringing a ton of Xbox consoles plasma

390
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:08,940
and high-definition televisions to all these colleges California Georgia

391
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:13,900
Michigan Iowa Washington all these places basically it's just an expo to

392
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,540
try and get college kids to get sucked into these games so they'll buy them

393
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:20,740
basically if you want more information on this visit the official website it's

394
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:27,820
www.gameliveevents.com it is going to be a strictly kind of Xbox promotional

395
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:33,220
it looks like so something to keep in mind that's all right that's all right

396
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:37,340
you know I used to be so anti Xbox I really was when it first came out but

397
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:42,420
you know what it is it's because of the narrowed kind of games it had but now I

398
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:47,860
think Xbox has a respectable library behind it Xbox had just already a future

399
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:52,180
that's true but it wasn't enough you know it wasn't it wasn't a legend of

400
00:26:52,180 --> 00:27:00,020
Zelda it did not have Katamari Damacy that's true it still does not have

401
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:05,780
Katamari Damacy something to think about one more story for you guys and we're

402
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:12,460
gonna call it a podcast GDC there was a panel at the GDC and it was um studying

403
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:16,940
the female gamer it was called in particular counting women the dollars

404
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:21,340
and cents behind female gamers and I knew Dark Sakura might have something to

405
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:25,840
say on this one I don't think there was anything bad here there was just kind of

406
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:31,060
an interesting hypothesis here as to why women don't prefer games as much as men

407
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:35,840
do and they kind of hypothesized that perhaps it's because men watch less

408
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,720
television and women are watching more television because you'll notice the

409
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:44,000
television programs are more aggressively going after women like

410
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,640
Desperate Housewives American Idol say what you want I realize you can't put

411
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,120
everybody in a certain bin but you know kind of the big picture what do you

412
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,080
think what do they need what in your opinion as a gamer girl what do they

413
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:01,240
need to do to get more women to play need to have more prissy froufrou games

414
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:05,240
I guess cuz I don't know oh come on surely you can't suggest that we're

415
00:28:05,240 --> 00:28:12,440
gonna have Barbie dress up see I'm not I'm not really a typical woman I'm not

416
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:19,100
into stupid girly bullshit you know I actually think for myself first of all

417
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:24,740
and don't let Dan boss me around that would be them and I don't watch TV I

418
00:28:24,740 --> 00:28:30,860
don't watch TV like at all I don't go off drooling over whoever this cute

419
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,540
actor is I mean I'll think he's attractive but I won't like have

420
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:40,020
obsessions about somebody you know Orlando Bloom oh my you know my poor

421
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:45,980
thighs or something. I'm sorry Orlando Bloom does not give me the screaming

422
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:50,020
thigh sweats. Another interesting, and tell me what you think about this dark

423
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:54,260
Sakura, an interesting thing here of suggesting that the popularity of the

424
00:28:54,260 --> 00:29:00,740
iToy which sold you know well over 3 million units in 2004, they're saying

425
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:04,620
that was largely due to the female market and its attraction to the device.

426
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:09,220
You think so? First of all I always thought the iToy was pretty stupid. Is

427
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:13,220
Is that because women like to look at themselves?

428
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:19,220
Honestly, I think, I really do not, I guess, think like the typical woman does.

429
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,220
But that's why we love you.

430
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,220
It's a lot of the disgusting, the things that just disgust me in general.

431
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:31,220
You know, I can understand doing girly things. I have my girly moments.

432
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,220
But the people who are like that all the damn time.

433
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:41,660
Like, my friend's sister, who was such an expert at MAC makeup by herself that they

434
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:44,140
let her work at the counter.

435
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:46,580
Yeah, I'm not kidding either.

436
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:49,980
She has a room dedicated to her makeup.

437
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:54,220
I know guys that could sadly probably run that counter as well.

438
00:29:54,220 --> 00:30:00,860
But, you know, she'll watch her husband play Halo and go, oh, yay, dumb.

439
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:04,180
But I don't think that she really plays anything because there's nothing on the market that

440
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:10,240
would appeal to her so you suggesting that the Xbox release Mac makeup no but

441
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:16,540
they can do I think that the sim games are more attractive overall because you

442
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:20,180
know especially things with customizable things and I do have to say that my

443
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:24,660
whole fascination with wrestling games is customizing the characters and making

444
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:28,100
my own wrestlers and stuff and making it as silent and bloody as possible and

445
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:32,020
designing their outfits while I'm at it you know and I kind of a little girl and

446
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:35,640
did kind of screw up my room on final fit my mock house on Final Fantasy 11

447
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:43,360
because I wanted to decorate it so now it's I have elements stylish you know

448
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:47,080
and I can't wait to see your house in Animal Crossing DS might I say you saw

449
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:54,480
my house I did I had the shrine to fire that was hilarious

450
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,600
remember Jamie's house Animal Crossing you would go downstairs and then she

451
00:30:57,600 --> 00:31:02,760
had like the music playing and there was just this huge campfire like huge

452
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:09,460
bonfire artifacts in my downstairs room not my upstairs room was like colonial

453
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:15,420
and downstairs I had like my bonsai collection I had every bonsai I had all

454
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:19,900
the instruments I had taiko drums two of them and in the background little CD

455
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:30,400
player going and I had the bonfire in the middle of my of my room there Dan

456
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,600
had an arcade see Animal Crossing is a good girl game I think I think it is you

457
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:38,160
know um another one that's a good everybody are you know mine and Dan's

458
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:46,060
friends Tina she she still made she maintains our village but we don't play

459
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:51,700
anymore that's nice that's good so you know I I really don't think that I'm

460
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:57,180
representative of the female market but I do think you're the best we could find

461
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:03,420
I'm just teasing but I'm the one who was begging for the whole Silent Hill

462
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:08,820
collection but I do think that they would have more success with doing I

463
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:15,900
honestly think that and this is just in dealing with people that I know a lot of

464
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:21,300
friends that I hang out with are a bit more intelligent than the average American. So

465
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,120
they enjoy challenge, challenging games, puzzles, things that make you think. But the average

466
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:31,880
person in this country isn't going to want too much of a challenge because they can't

467
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:39,160
handle it. They're going to want something where, I also think a sim is the best thing

468
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:44,120

471

You got it for free all right. We got to wrap it up final thoughts times Loki

472
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:06,120
It would be awesome if they put Martha Stewart as a playable character in postal 3

473
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:13,200
because she's so hardcore now that she's gotten out of jail my final thought is

474
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,640
