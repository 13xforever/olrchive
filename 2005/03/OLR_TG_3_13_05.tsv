666	27175	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 14th, 2005 And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition Your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming And all the news on video games that don't suck And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki Hello, one more time everybody Welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition
27967	34769	Your home for all that news on video games that don't suck, and well, some that do, because it just sneaks in there sometimes.
35209	37249	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
37310	41491	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
42611	44531	Sakura.
45352	46352	Sakura.
46392	46992	Sa.
47112	47632	Sa.
47652	49393	Hi.
49653	51913	Say hello also to Loki.
52834	55974	I am referred to as a tsunami to these gummy bears.
57135	57655	How so?
58120	61942	Because I've already eaten so many of them and taken their lives.
62542	62882	I see.
63983	65824	Three pounds down since last week.
66484	67384	That's a lot of gummy.
68385	69545	Have you thrown up gummy yet?
69825	70006	Nope.
70366	70706	Alright.
72207	74228	Alright, let's get into it.
74448	76128	What kind of games have you guys been playing this week?
76509	77109	DarkSakura?
78830	83492	I played a little Final Fantasy XI, like maybe for ten minutes.
84201	86362	I don't know, I did some significant play earlier in the week.
87843	88724	Lots of Tekken 5.
90045	91325	Got to see all the endings now.
92226	94988	Ganryu's ending is hilarious.
96108	97729	That's really it.
98830	101652	Alright, so a little more Tekken 5 for DarkSakura.
102672	104113	Jamie, er, sorry, Loki.
106095	109817	Parodius, I played that for a little bit on the main cabinet.
110938	111438	And, um,
112125	114327	The rest of the week was just Final Fantasy XI.
114928	116869	Lots and lots of Final Fantasy XI.
119011	120152	Same old theme going on.
120192	121353	Why Parodius?
122054	122354	I don't know.
122775	123115	Why not?
123615	130301	I played Aliens vs. Predator last week, and I'll play probably another game, because I have to get my money's worth out of this cabinet.
130802	134265	And to put it this way, that's $3,000 worth of quarters.
135166	135466	All right.
136709	163943	I decided to treat myself to some new video games this week so I went out shopping the other day and I picked up a copy of Zelda Minish Cap because I've been meaning to get that for a long time so I have that for my DS now and yes I know that Minish Cap is a Game Boy Advance game but you know what my DS is my Game Boy Advance right now because it doesn't need up batteries like the Game Boy Advance does because you just plug it in and all that so I'm loving the Minish Cap right now I think it's a great game I love the 16-bit
165197	167079	Zelda game, of course, linked to the past.
167480	170763	So, I think that Minish Cap kind of invokes a lot of that old stuff.
170783	174066	But the cool thing is, they take a lot from, like, Ocarina of Time.
174086	179252	Like, they take a lot of the music, they take some of the new enemies that were in there, like the Deku nuts and stuff like that.
179312	181154	They show up, but in 16-bit form.
181474	182475	And I just think that's so cool.
182515	185719	And I like the puzzle element of turning small and all that stuff.
186339	186820	Pretty good game.
187532	197720	I also picked up, because it was only $10, because it's kind of an older game now, but I picked up a copy of Phantasy Star Online on the Xbox, because I guess we just needed a new MMO to talk about on this program.
197740	201423	And I know Jamie used to play PSO a long time ago, but you stopped, right?
201463	205206	My characters are still... I think I just hit V-Hard.
206066	210630	So, if you want to help leveling, I've got people who'll help you level.
211210	211471	Okay.
211731	213252	I mean, and we've got stuff for you.
213712	216314	We have Al Rappi's, which you're not supposed to have.
217702	218503	Alright, sounds good.
218583	219043	Maybe, maybe.
220024	224246	I kind of liked Phantasy Star Online because it reminds me of a 3D Diablo.
224266	225487	That's kind of why I like that game.
226588	227508	I don't know.
227528	232031	I thought about playing it again because I actually do have it for the Dreamcast, but I gotta cheat.
233852	234393	That's what I do.
234413	235954	That's the only way you can play games is to cheat.
236194	238936	Don't you think that cheating in MMORPGs is unethical?
239156	239336	Nope.
240817	241097	Alright.
241590	245273	Well, we'll start off some gaming news tonight with some news about an MMORPG.
245373	248615	Blizzard said they were going to do this for a long time.
248655	249376	They finally did it.
249396	256401	They closed over 1,000 accounts related to gold farming on World of Warcraft and character sales.
257482	265608	Blizzard says, Over the recent weeks, we have been investigating the activities of certain individuals who have been farming gold in order to sell it in exchange for real world currency.
266068	269671	After researching the situation, we have issued permanent suspensions to over 1,000 accounts.
271292	272753	that have been engaging in this practice.
272813	279537	We do not condone such actions and will take decisive action as they are against our policy and damage the game economy as a whole.
279997	284900	1,000 World of Warcraft players get in the boot, which should hopefully speed up some of those servers.
285180	285841	So, I don't know.
285861	287422	What do you think about this, Loki?
287462	290864	I know you have a strong opinion on buying stuff in-game with real money.
291824	293945	I don't have a problem with it, but I think it's a good idea.
294366	294706	Why not?
295367	303470	That Square Enix is always threatening Oh, we're gonna do something You watch, one of these days we're gonna do something Well, didn't they ban like 700 people?
303510	307872	But that was more for harassing players No, it wasn't 700 people, it was 80 people I'm sorry, 80?
308352	313714	80 people, 80, over the, over And this is over, like, you know, what, 24 servers?
313754	325079	No, wait a minute, I thought it was like 800 And then when you went across the number of servers there were It was like maybe 20 people a server or something No, it wasn't anything Weird And all the guild sellers are still there Oh, yeah
326616	329537	DarkSakura, any opinion you have on buying and selling?
329557	330557	I wouldn't do it, honestly.
330877	336418	I'd just be all cute in-game and have people, oh, I feel sorry for you, here's money.
353081	356046	So you would like to be the equivalent of an MMO bum?
356066	356987	No.
357728	364839	I'm actually going to stop selling my crystals so that I can make lumber and give people wood.
367263	367704	There you go.
369299	383472	I was thinking if you got desperate, you could start turning tricks and MMOs for De Niro, but that's what's already going on in Sims Online, from what I understand, is that Sims Online just turned into a giant Vegas, so that's why nobody's really playing it.
383752	386274	They don't have emotes for that yet in Final Fantasy XI.
386575	387696	What, turning tricks?
388136	388416	Yeah.
388516	389137	Just you wait.
389657	392360	Slash Pizza was only the beginning for these MMOs.
393427	394688	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
412564	414305	And sure enough, here it is.
414365	415006	It's coming true.
415486	420589	They've announced that the next console, the Revolution console, is going to have Wi-Fi.
420889	425472	And I could swear this was just last week when I was saying it would connect to your DS via Wi-Fi.
425492	427173	They would be stupid not to put it in there.
427253	429874	This was months ago that we've announced this.
429934	431615	It was months ago that this was going to happen.
431695	436158	Also months ago, I mean... Well, we speculated it, but now it's official.
436218	436878	Oh, come on.
437158	438179	We knew this was going to happen.
438259	439019	I'm just saying.
439600	441541	There's a thin line you've got to draw there, so...
442958	445561	Certainly no big surprise there, but here's the other interesting part.
445981	448844	Again, we've been speculating this for quite some time now.
449304	453488	Nintendo's announced that the DSs are going to be going online.
453928	462617	So just like you go into a Starbucks and you have a Wi-Fi hotspot type place, even if you have a hotspot in your house with Wi-Fi, now your DS can get on the internet.
462637	467321	See, but I thought those spots you had to pay for, or you had to have some sort of password to get into them.
467441	470722	Well, Nintendo, now we don't know the details on this yet, so maybe this could change.
471082	474343	But Nintendo is saying right now this is going to be a free service.
474603	475123	And you know what?
475163	477143	If it's just using the internet, it's already there.
477523	478864	Guess who's got Wi-Fi at home?
478964	479344	There you go.
479364	481204	So you're going to be able to use the DS on the internet.
481504	485625	Very first game that's going to support this, Animal Crossing DS.
485805	486906	I'm so happy.
486946	493247	Which makes a lot of fanboys and girls of that game very happy because a lot of people have been saying since that game first came out,
493991	494851	I should be online.
494932	497753	Forget... And we were all in Animal Crossing.
497833	500855	I know all three of us were really all up on that game when it first came out.
501155	503636	Loki, of course, was cheating on it to the best of his ability.
504497	511360	I was only utilizing an error that they made in their game programming, okay?
511540	513421	I did not use any sort of codes.
514022	516123	I just found a way to duplicate items, okay?
516683	518844	I remember like, hey, Jamie, you're going out of town.
518884	521766	Let me borrow your village so I can get your villagers to say shit and fuck.
523342	524082	That's right.
524683	525423	I remember that.
525783	528545	And I remember, I was so mad when my town lesbian left.
529085	529705	That's right.
529985	530746	What was her name?
531046	531746	Olivia?
532247	533727	No, Olivia was the pretty white cat.
534308	535828	There's, oh man, I don't know.
536229	539891	But, um, I remember I even made the sign to hang outside of her house.
541327	542327	I love how you can make the signs.
542347	544028	I love how you can make the signs.
544048	548129	I'm just going to be scared because you're going to have people vandalizing your towns and shit.
548409	549970	This is going to be crazy.
550670	553291	You're going to have animal crossing gangs.
554071	555371	I am kidding you not.
555391	560153	They're going to be flashing their gang colors and there's going to be gang signs.
560193	561393	People are going to get tagged.
561773	563994	I would think... You're going to get hackers out there?
564074	564715	It's crazy.
564895	569577	I would think, and I would hope, that Nintendo is already one step ahead of you in the planning of this game.
569977	573159	And they'll make it... Because Nintendo's always been a very family-friendly thing.
573479	582183	So they don't want any old person going into some seven-year-old's village and starting to make the townspeople say, you know, fuck me silly, you know, things like that.
582663	590627	So I would think that there's going to be something set up where you will have to grant permission to only trusted individuals to enter your town, I would imagine.
592602	602846	Loki's screen name is going to be Free Candy Jesus Juice Do you remember what my island was called?
603046	609008	I think it was like Big Tits or something And what was it like God, what was my town called?
609048	618992	It was like something cock It was like Big Cock or Monster Cock or something Big Cock, yes And note the great thing though is I am going to take
621364	623785	and shrink it down to the pixel size.
625506	627868	Goat Sam, I'm going to put it all over the place.
627928	628668	Get a life.
629288	629929	Get a life.
630429	631049	It'll be fun.
631089	632750	You will be denied access to my village.
633110	639514	But this is just going to... I can't even think of the implications this game is going to have.
639634	641815	It's going to be a very exciting thing, I think.
642315	642675	I can't.
643156	643656	I'll be bored.
643996	647238	This game is coming out the day after my birthday or it's coming out the same week.
647768	652549	Do you think that this was done to kind of one-up the PSP right before its launch date?
653310	659111	PSP said it's going to be online, but honestly, I think we're going to see that PSP is pretty much just Xbox Live.
659832	667974	It's been like this whole thing, DS versus PSP, has been like this big cock-waving competition where it's like, Oh yeah, well the DS is going to come out first.
668214	668534	Thwack!
668854	670655	Oh yeah, well the PSP is going to show movies.
670915	671235	Thwack!
671535	673136	Oh yeah, well the DS is going to be online.
673336	673676	Thwack!
674216	675337	Oh yeah, so is the PSP!
675837	677678	It's just, you know, continuing, you know?
678258	688123	Yeah, but where there's going to be 18 titles for launch on the PSP, 15 or 18, Nintendo's only coming out with like one game.
688303	693405	I know, that's really DS's weakness, but Nintendo, they've always been good at this.
693725	696907	When their game comes out, their game is just...
699506	704550	And then we're going to do the Game Boy Advance 2 or SP2 or whatever.
704570	705291	No, Game Boy Advance 2.
705751	709554	And it's because the DS isn't the Game Boy.
709574	711255	The DS is supposed to be the adult system.
711355	714518	It's being marketed in Japan as the system for adults.
715382	716243	I wouldn't get that impression.
716303	721569	It may be in Japan, but here... Yeah, because he knows Zookeeper.
721669	722029	Woo!
722690	723811	That's an adult title.
723871	731840	Hey, actually, since it's basically just a ripoff of Bejeweled, I see tons of people that I work with wasting their day away playing Bejeweled instead of working, might I add.
732981	734303	So, something to think about.
734443	734903	Slackers.
735064	735324	Alright.
736656	743158	Speaking of Nintendo, they always have that one game that comes out that makes you have to buy their system.
743519	747300	So, DarkSakura, if you have a moment, I'd like you to come over, if you can.
747400	748260	Bring your microphone.
749061	754422	Because DarkSakura is probably the only gamer on the planet that has not seen this this week yet.
755403	758864	It's the brand new Zelda trailer from the GDC.
758924	761325	So I'm going to give a running commentary of what's going on in the trailer.
761803	763264	We're going to get Jamie's live reaction.
763324	767486	So here is the brand new Zelda trailer, which I know doesn't make for great radio.
768086	770167	Maybe it'll help you relive some memories here.
770287	771488	So here it is.
772568	774409	So, of course, it starts off rating pending.
776370	777170	Legend of Zelda.
779011	784354	There's Link looking all manly and swimming around in a very nice-looking water scene.
786875	788456	And then just some lighting.
788776	788936	No.
789296	790497	And then Link saving a kitty.
790557	791157	He has kitty!
792031	794192	And then just a very scary statue thing.
795373	797213	Some more fighting at night.
797373	798614	And then Link riding a horse.
798654	799654	Look at how great this looks.
799694	802196	And some, like, boar-looking creatures in the game as well.
803276	805177	Huh?
805457	806017	It might have been.
806097	810439	It might have been.
811140	812320	And then the skeleton creatures.
816762	818643	And then some more fighting in the underground.
819543	820804	Some scary ghost creatures.
821624	824206	I swear this is just like Ocarina.
825046	827088	Yeah, but it's like way better looking.
828008	831530	And look at this, riding the horse and fighting at the same time, fighting creatures.
834692	838395	And then, of course, Goma shows up in every game.
840216	840997	Some more fighting.
842117	844579	And then there he is riding one of those boar-type creatures.
845620	849182	Just some fighting with a kind of interesting freeze effect.
850788	853011	When He Hits Something, and then of course the wolf thing at the end.
853231	854533	So that's the new Zelda trailer.
854553	861441	There's a lot of stuff that they took from Wind Waker as well.
861621	864304	So I noticed a lot of that stuff too that they have adapted from it.
864965	867188	This is the game they should have put out instead of Wind Waker.
867548	867829	It is.
868029	868790	That's what I've been saying.
869230	869691	That's perfect.
892930	894454	Exactly, that was my reaction too.
894835	895697	And I'm sure a lot of folks.
896679	900608	Those of you guys that want to download the trailer for yourself, tons of gaming sites out there have it.
900628	901871	Just look around on some of the big ones.
902372	930631	You will not have a problem finding that, trust me Alright, let's talk about one other console real fast Sony, PlayStation 3 Rumor is they're going to show it next week But we didn't see anything yet Who knows, but we will be seeing it for sure At E3 in LA later on this year So that's all we know so far about what's going on with PlayStation 3 So they're kind of, whereas Nintendo and Xbox Are kind of showing off what they've got We'll talk about Xbox in a little bit
931633	934454	PlayStation 3's keeping some of it a secret.
934474	936535	You've heard some of it, but not a whole lot.
936555	938235	PlayStation 3's got a lot under the hood.
938315	940576	That's what I've been hearing.
940716	943177	I think they're basically keeping it under wraps.
943257	946118	And then, you know, Xbox, look at what we can do in the PS3.
946138	948018	It's like, yeah, but look at this.
948379	949519	Boo yeah!
949619	950159	Served!
951980	952340	All right.
953218	956921	We're going to get to a segment called, well, do we have a name for this?
957222	959904	I don't know, but DarkSakura, oh yes, DarkSakura's Advice Column.
960444	963987	And DarkSakura is going to better your life with some advice.
964668	966309	Useful advice.
966530	967551	Yes, very usable advice.
967591	977879	And if you're feeling a little, you know, tingly after thinking about that Zelda trailer all over again, here's some of DarkSakura's advice to put you in a more clear state of mind.
977939	978560	So here we go.
979121	980702	And what is your advice column about tonight?
981687	984508	Today's piece of advice is how to control a runaway camel.
985688	990149	Number one, hang on to the reins, but do not pull them back hard enough to stop the camel.
990669	993529	Yanking on the reins can tear the camel's nose or break the reins.
994549	1000850	Number two, if the camel has sturdy reins in the head halter, pull the reins to one side to make the camel run in a circle.
1001671	1005191	Number three, hold on until the camel stops.
1005891	1009112	Whether the camel is running in circles or straight, it will not run very far.
1009775	1012677	simply hang on until the camel slows and sits down.
1013838	1017580	Of course, you know what my final piece of advice always is in these situations?
1017701	1017961	What?
1018281	1019742	Don't get on the fucking camel!
1023565	1025126	Yeah, don't get on the camel.
1025666	1026086	Alright.
1028548	1029869	Thank you very much for that advice.
1030515	1034196	We're going to start a new segment here on the Orange Lounge Radio podcast.
1034256	1041119	And we've been meaning to get into this for some time, but just recently we've been starting to get a lot of good emails on our feedback address.
1041179	1044420	It's togo at orangeloungeradio.com.
1044720	1046441	So if you want, you can send us an email there.
1047061	1048721	And it's our mailbag.
1049081	1054243	So we're going to answer an Orange Lounge Radio feedback email on this podcast right now.
1054303	1059305	So we're going to cue up some familiar feedback music here for those of you guys that listen to the three-hour show.
1062339	1065161	Alright, let's dig into the Orange Lounge radio mailbag.
1065281	1074008	Alright, Ken from New Jersey is writing us, I subscribe to your To Go because I normally don't have time to listen to your regular show all the time.
1074248	1075569	Understandable, that's why we created this.
1076129	1079371	And I have an iPod, so I thought this would be the next best thing, and it was.
1080192	1088038	It is good how you talk about games and all, and I enjoy listening to it in the car, but one thing I'm just asking or suggesting, could you guys please talk about music games more?
1088278	1090980	I see you have the name Orange Lounge, but I don't hear much on music games.
1091947	1097612	Talk about upcoming events and things going on with the DDR music game community because I'd really love to hear more about it.
1097772	1098813	Thanks, Ken.
1099414	1100494	Well, thank you for the email, Ken.
1100775	1101495	We appreciate that.
1103197	1104218	Wow, what can we say on this?
1105282	1110906	Orange Lounge Radio was started as a music game, rhythm game, and all that such.
1111947	1114148	Everything from DDR to Prappa the Rapper, 2DX.
1114788	1116390	Our station was really founded on that.
1117210	1124435	But as the station has kind of progressed over the past few years, we've kind of started evolving into wanting to take on the bigger picture.
1124895	1130019	And that is really kind of what we tagline this podcast with, the video games that don't suck.
1130479	1132861	We don't want to be the folks that are talking about, you know...
1133801	1147198	Madden, and not that these games suck, they're respectable games, but we just, we want to speak to those of a different gamer crowd, the ones that aren't, you know, necessarily playing those games that the media is shoving down your throat and everything, so, um,
1148197	1156886	We still have our three-hour talk program on Sunday nights live on OrangeLawnTrader.com, and that is the show that is dedicated still to music games and us as well.
1157226	1163693	And believe me, if there is really big music game news, we're going to mention it on this show because we always do respect DDR.
1163733	1169859	We did talk about the DDR with Mario a few episodes ago, you know, in the groove, having a home release and things like that.
1170719	1179383	Remember that DDR itself hasn't had a whole lot of news recently outside of the song packs continuing to come out for Ultramix and things like that.
1180583	1188807	But believe me, when we get word of new console releases of DDR, they will be all over this podcast as well as on our three-hour show in more depth.
1188867	1190227	Anything you want to add to that, DarkSakura?
1191408	1193329	There's really only so much we can talk about.
1193689	1197170	Well, I played poppin' music yesterday.
1197911	1198151	Right.
1198491	1198791	You know...
1199457	1199737	DarkSakura.com
1218385	1218885	What happened?
1219005	1222786	So, you know, we totally understand your desire to want to hear about music games.
1222826	1226688	We're not trying to, you know, disrespect you or anything because we really, really respect music games.
1227028	1235971	But just understand that the podcast, and this is for everybody out there, the podcast is really something that we're trying to make dedicated more towards those other games that we're into besides Bomani.
1235991	1241432	But, of course, we're always, always going to mention, because we're gaming fans first, Bomani fans second, really.
1241933	1242753	That's what this is all about.
1244116	1245196	Anyway, enough rambling there.
1245236	1252259	Again, if you have an email you want to send to us, togo at orangeloungeradio.com Loki, I didn't ask if you had anything you wanted to add to that, too.
1252479	1253139	Nah, not really.
1253699	1254739	I guess we kind of hit on it, right?
1254959	1255580	Yeah, pretty much.
1256040	1262242	Well, here's a story you had actually posted on the orangeloungeradio.com website where we do talk about a lot of general gaming news.
1262442	1265723	Xbox Next, or, you know, that's kind of the project name right now.
1265763	1267383	It's also been referred to as Xenon.
1267423	1269204	Who knows what this is going to be called for sure.
1270524	1272265	Some of the specs is coming out on this.
1274275	1275115	Very interesting.
1275155	1277956	You can read the specs on our site, OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
1280596	1281797	Very interesting stuff.
1282357	1286378	Xenon CPU has three 3.0 GHz PowerPC cores.
1286878	1292099	Each core is capable of two instructions per cycle and has an L1 cache with 32 kilobytes for data.
1292399	1293159	Blah, blah, blah.
1293239	1294339	All this technical stuff.
1294719	1297600	Loki, can you sum up what this all means here?
1297620	1299040	It means it'll look pretty.
1299780	1300781	I guess, basically.
1301321	1301881	More or less.
1301981	1302721	It'll just run.
1303390	1303610	Better.
1303630	1309252	What they're basically doing is instead of having one processor dedicated to everything, they're just separating it.
1309753	1311173	I thought this was interesting.
1312554	1313474	I thought this was interesting.
1313774	1315855	It sounds like they're wanting to build a camera into this.
1315895	1318316	They're saying that it will have a USB 2.0 camera.
1318356	1322798	It's capable of 1.2 megapixel still shots and VGA videos.
1322878	1325259	Photos can be used in-game for gamer profiles.
1325699	1326900	I don't know if it's going to be built into it.
1326920	1330841	It might be like an attachment that's packaged with it.
1330982	1332022	I doubt they would actually...
1332959	1334359	I listen to people bitching every day about...
1360394	1361635	It's a widescreen!
1361655	1363736	There's bars on top and bottom!
1363816	1364956	I don't like it!
1365036	1366397	That's because these people are idiots.
1366457	1368118	Yes, they are idiots, but you know what?
1368338	1373440	They make up most of the United States, and that's, sadly enough, that's what people are talking about here.
1374720	1381003	These HDTVs are not cheap by any means, and to be honest, I mean, you're really not missing much.
1381623	1382564	You're really not.
1383684	1384305	But you know what?
1384345	1387486	Hey, go out, buy the expensive console systems.
1387766	1388907	You know, for example, I...
1391484	1395265	I remember when I got my CD burner from my computer the very first one.
1396105	1396605	I spent $300 on it.
1396625	1396966	$300 on a CD burner.
1397006	1397726	Guess how fast it was?
1397746	1397926	4 speed.
1397986	1399407	I can buy a 52 speed burner for $50 now.
1406940	1407681	Perfect example.
1407961	1410182	I sell them at price for $25.
1410343	1410803	Okay, $25.
1411483	1411984	Perfect example.
1412284	1414406	These TVs, thousands of dollars right now.
1414886	1416607	Give it a year, they'll be not.
1416807	1420510	Just yesterday I was looking at Best Buy, these TVs, and I was thinking, my God, these are so expensive.
1420550	1424153	But by Christmas, I'll bet you that'll be the big thing they try to push this Christmas, is HDTVs.
1424453	1425374	And they'll come way down in price.
1425394	1426635	Everyone's selling TVs now.
1426695	1428236	Gateway, Dell, that's crazy.
1430361	1437852	Anyway, also along the Xbox Next, their next system, they're going to be changing up the dashboard in Xbox Live.
1438172	1439655	It's going to be built from the ground up.
1439835	1442058	It sounds like they're going to do a lot more of...
1442992	1445873	These like purchasing these items for use in game.
1445973	1449174	Maybe like pennies at a time, things like this where you're going to be able to buy stuff.
1449534	1457037	The new dashboard will have this prominent spot where it will feature slots for both games and also digital media you can buy through the Xbox.
1457177	1458318	That should be very interesting.
1458358	1462119	So it sounds like they might be trying to make this new Xbox a multi-purpose console.
1462659	1463820	Buy movies online?
1464240	1465481	Bet you that's what they're going for.
1465641	1466181	We'll see though.
1466321	1469282	Will I be able to hold it up to my head and talk into it like a phone?
1470370	1470991	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1485155	1489178	Speaking of Xbox, you know they had a big game out last year called Fable.
1489758	1491919	Well, news coming out this week, let's make it short.
1492139	1493900	It's coming out for the PC as well.
1493940	1496222	And it's going to be called Fable The Lost Chapters.
1496802	1501945	And of course the title would make you think that it's going to have additional content not found in its console counterpart.
1502366	1503106	And that would be correct.
1503126	1506248	There's going to be more quests, more regions, more story.
1507031	1510574	New armor, new weapons, da-da-da, all on your PC.
1510854	1514877	And that story kind of makes sense, because, you know, it was... Fable was pretty cool.
1515317	1516558	I'd actually play it on PC.
1516798	1520221	I haven't gotten a chance to get really into it, but I think it is the kind of game I would pick up on the PC.
1520301	1526025	And I applaud Microsoft for finally releasing a game like that on the Xbox, because it badly needed it.
1526125	1530348	You know, they had to program it in where the villagers would eventually kick you out of their town if you stayed too long.
1530829	1534251	Because before, you could have actually settled in a village.
1536273	1536473	Huh.
1537513	1538534	You know what I like about that game?
1538955	1542558	Is the fact that you can be gay, straight, or bi in it.
1542638	1544220	And you can actually date men if you want.
1544500	1545421	That's kind of funny to me.
1546962	1548223	Alright.
1548483	1550005	It's like The Sims all over again.
1552335	1555197	There's going to be a tour going around U.S.
1555277	1556959	colleges in March and April.
1557019	1558480	It's going to be touring 25 U.S.
1558520	1558980	campuses.
1559020	1560602	It's called Game Live.
1561162	1567187	And basically, they're going to be bringing a ton of Xbox consoles, plasma, and high-definition televisions to all these colleges.
1567888	1571631	California, Georgia, Michigan, Iowa, Washington, all these places.
1572571	1575994	Basically, it's just an expo to try and get college kids to get sucked into these games.
1576014	1577215	So they'll buy them, basically.
1577475	1580558	If you want more information on this, visit the official website.
1580598	1581098	It's www.
1582079	1585741	GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com GameLiveEvents.com
1608737	1609898	That's true, but it wasn't enough.
1610458	1612640	It wasn't a Legend of Zelda.
1612660	1613901	It had Buffy.
1614061	1618304	Yeah, but it did not have Katamari Damacy.
1618564	1619065	That's true.
1619265	1620806	It still does not have Katamari Damacy.
1621486	1622147	Something to think about.
1623771	1626936	One more story for you guys, and we're going to call it a podcast.
1627336	1633685	GDC, there was a panel at the GDC, and it was studying the female gamer.
1633785	1638933	It was called, in particular, Counting Women, the Dollars and Cents Behind Female Gamers.
1639571	1640651	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1668874	1672575	You can't put everybody in a certain bin, but, you know, kind of the big picture.
1672875	1673355	What do you think?
1674256	1674816	What do they need?
1675076	1678337	In your opinion, as a gamer girl, what do they need to do to get more women to play?
1678357	1682738	They need to have more prissy frou-frou games, I guess, because I don't know.
1682918	1683599	Oh, come on.
1683679	1686900	Surely you can't suggest that we're going to have Barbie dress up.
1689560	1692201	See, I'm not really a typical woman.
1692221	1695462	I'm not into stupid girly bullshit, you know?
1695942	1697863	I actually think for myself...
1698743	1707208	I don't watch TV at all.
1707769	1711411	I don't go off drooling over whoever this cute actor is.
1711451	1715374	I mean, I'll think he's attractive, but I won't have obsessions about somebody.
1715834	1720997	You know, Orlando Bloom, oh my poor thighs or something.
1723799	1726541	I'm sorry, Orlando Bloom does not give me the screaming thigh sweats.
1727552	1737905	Another interesting, and tell me what you think about this, DarkSakura, an interesting thing here, suggesting that the popularity of the eye toy, which sold, you know, well over 3 million units in 2004.
1740385	1744769	They're saying that was largely due to the female market and its attraction to the device.
1745209	1745749	You think so?
1746350	1748672	First of all, I always thought thy toy was pretty stupid.
1749212	1751694	Is that because women like to look at themselves?
1753495	1758599	Honestly, I really do not, I guess, think like the typical woman does.
1759480	1760601	But that's why we love you.
1760861	1764464	It's a lot of the things that just disgust me in general.
1765685	1766666	I can understand...
1768419	1769480	Doing girly things.
1769560	1770781	I have my girly moments.
1770901	1773464	But the people who were like that all the damn time.
1774184	1776126	Like my friend's sister.
1777587	1783212	Who was such an expert at Mac makeup by herself that they let her work at the counter.
1784793	1785955	Yeah, I'm not kidding either.
1786575	1788657	She has a room dedicated to her makeup.
1790118	1793101	I know guys that could sadly probably run that counter as well.
1794142	1794362	But...
1796892	1797392	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1813819	1818743	are more attractive overall because, you know, especially things with customizable things.
1819163	1829850	And I do have to say that my whole fascination with wrestling games is customizing the characters and making my own wrestlers and stuff and making them as violent and bloody as possible and designing their outfits while I'm at it.
1830811	1831892	That's a little girly.
1831932	1836895	And I did kind of screw up my room on Final Fantasy, my mod house on Final Fantasy XI because I wanted to decorate it.
1837456	1839777	So now it's, I have elements stylish.
1841659	1841859	So...
1843557	1846620	and I can't wait to see your house in Animal Crossing DS, might I say.
1846760	1848642	You saw my house on Animal Crossing.
1848742	1849002	I did.
1849142	1852526	I had the shrine to fire downstairs.
1852826	1853206	You did.
1853526	1854507	That was hilarious.
1854828	1856309	Remember Jamie's house in Animal Crossing?
1856329	1863696	You would go downstairs and then she had like the music playing and there was just this huge campfire, like huge bonfire.
1864056	1867559	I had a lot of the Japanese artifacts in my downstairs room.
1867899	1869501	My upstairs room was like colonial.
1870390	1873812	and downstairs I had my bonsai collection.
1873852	1874932	I had every bonsai.
1874992	1875993	I had a lot of the instruments.
1876013	1876933	I had taiko drums.
1877353	1877894	Two of them.
1878734	1889899	And in the background a little CD player going... And I had the bonfire in the middle of my room there.
1890280	1891160	Dan had an arcade.
1891400	1893481	See, Animal Crossing is a good girl game, I think.
1893781	1894262	I think it is.
1894282	1896143	Another one of mine and Dan's friends...
1900103	1906626	Tina, she maintains our village that we don't play with anymore.
1907306	1907827	That's nice.
1907907	1908307	That's good.
1909787	1913909	I really don't think that I'm representative of the female market.
1916190	1917311	You're the best we could find.
1918331	1919152	I'm teasing.
1921193	1923994	I'm the one who was begging for the whole Silent Hill collection.
1924794	1928436	But I do think that they would have more success with doing...
1929233	1939978	I honestly think that, and this is just in dealing with people that I know, a lot of the friends that I hang out with are a good bit more intelligent than the average American.
1940859	1944901	So they enjoy challenging games, puzzles, things that make you think.
1945701	1952444	But the average person in this country isn't going to want too much of a challenge because they can't handle it.
1953145	1955406	They're going to want something where...
