779602	792293	Starting it off with a little bit of fun by Mr. T. Karma, Taku, Starfield by Sara, and Rick being remixed by Hisashi and Nawata with Rizlum, the remix there.
792873	793434	Hope you enjoyed that.
795615	796876	Or if you're Jamie, you didn't enjoy that.
796916	797217	I don't know.
798137	801279	Dot, dot, dot What is your problem with Night Style anyway?
801339	814187	I love Night Style Stupid timing bullshit Which I hope they fixed in the home version We will find out very soon I'm gonna order mine just so I can have it I'm still missing 4th Style though Yeah Oh man You know what?
814247	826254	Night Style actually brought a lot of songs over from 4th Style In their return songs Like Empathy, hello Like one of the best Taku songs ever They brought back for Night Style That makes me happy Empathy pisses me off But I love Empathy It still pisses me off You shut your mouth
828856	832659	for the next break I will do some forest style music just to make you happy what?
836962	851492	oh my god I finally did the little flash game on the grudge site and it's kind of spooky speaking of Japanese movies that became American movies did you get a chance to go see Ring 2 yet?
852152	853233	no I hear it's crap
854008	857429	Which makes me sad, because the first one is seriously one of the greatest horror movies.
857449	859390	Because it hardly deviated from the original.
860690	862891	I'm going to go see it, but I'm still waiting for Darkwater.
864391	866952	But I want to buy the book first.
867612	869853	I'm so happy, because Loop is going to be out soon.
870273	870513	Really?
871154	876735	Loop is the third book in the Ring series, which, if you read the books, it goes in a completely different direction.
876835	881377	Although, from watching the trailers of Ring 2, it sort of seems like a tie-in, almost.
881557	881697	Hmm.
882401	883542	I am smart, S-M-R-T, smart
907955	911078	Yeah, I got you the Harry Potter book and you never read it.
911218	912840	I, I, now wait a minute.
912980	914081	I read two chapters.
914441	914982	Give me a break.
915002	916463	That's not, no.
917844	919846	I, I do want to read Harry Potter someday.
919866	920947	It's just... You can read.
923970	926392	Anyway, uh, starting off... Up, up, up, up, up, up.
926412	928674	Whoa, whoa, whoa.
928815	930016	Starting off tonight's show...
931812	932372	L-Mullet Honorary
957800	958362	What does that mean?
958402	959163	I know, who cares, right?
959183	959804	What does that mean?
960065	964934	We are taking the first step in becoming a legitimate business operation.
970184	972165	We're going to have our paparazzi.
988935	993118	and we decided, you know, we ought to actually settle these things with like a DDR match.
993839	995960	I was about to say that too.
997101	1001244	I also had suggested a cream corn wrestling cage match.
1001464	1002565	If it's chess, I'll win.
1003926	1004627	He totally will win.
1004667	1005287	I suck at chess.
1005327	1005648	I'm horrible.
1006048	1009570	Anyway, so we're officially on our way.
1009831	1016536	Which you know that means because we are officially becoming a business you can expect pop-ups to be coming to the site effective tomorrow.
1016616	1016996	No, I'm kidding.
1017472	1019613	I'm telling you, we will not be having pop-up ads on the site.
1019973	1020854	Pop-up ads are evil.
1021494	1024595	And half of you guys have them blocked anyway, so what good would it do anyway?
1025756	1027997	So, congratulations to us.
1028577	1028977	Whee!
1029778	1030038	All right.
1030338	1036080	And if you would like to send a cash congratulations, a cash notice or a cash thank you, like I was telling you.
1036541	1044284	Yeah, just send that to... You can address those care of Rob at OrangeLaunchRadio.com and I'll make sure those get forwarded appropriately.
1046065	1046345	All right.
1048504	1051805	And now for the El Mullet Honorary How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day segment.
1053025	1055885	A little bit about us and how our day is going.
1056145	1056605	I worked.
1056725	1057005	Jamie.
1057426	1057786	I worked.
1057846	1058466	I went to school.
1058686	1059006	Yay.
1059346	1060386	I exercised a lot.
1060506	1060806	Yay.
1061846	1068487	Um... I actually, though, I was all nervous about my Photoshop assignment and then I found that he postponed it another two weeks.
1069848	1071368	Excuse me, and I just burped.
1071788	1072468	Nacho burp.
1073248	1076909	Anyway, um... It was... It was very cool.
1077169	1077249	Um...
1079378	1083700	Yesterday I hung out with Tia and some of her friends.
1084500	1085460	And I went to Curves.
1086620	1087781	I had never been before.
1087901	1090862	Isn't Curves the place that plays Jesus music while you work out?
1091002	1092863	No, they play like dance music.
1093203	1095043	Oh, I heard they play Jesus music.
1095784	1097204	You know that's why my mom stopped going.
1097964	1099065	No, this is the one downtown.
1099565	1100905	Oh, well I guess maybe it's different.
1100925	1105107	It depends on which one you go to because I think they're sort of, I think they're franchised.
1105767	1106807	Oh, well maybe that's it then.
1106947	1108268	But this one was downtown.
1109355	1110235	It was kind of neat.
1110796	1114797	It wasn't, you know, the exercise I need, but I still got a workout out of it.
1115757	1122139	But it uses resistance machines and then these bouncy things that you hop up and down on in between doing the resistance machines.
1122159	1126201	And you're only doing this like 15, 30 seconds each time.
1126741	1130342	But as you go through a couple of circuits of it, you're like, ooh, tired.
1131422	1134103	But it wasn't really, I was tired but not like fatigued.
1134363	1135184	Not like I'm supposed to be.
1135604	1136224	I didn't hurt.
1137344	1138625	And unless it hurts...
1139741	1140862	For me, it's not a workout.
1142183	1146327	So, um, today I played like three hours of Silent Hill 3.
1148108	1149649	And sat around on my ass.
1149669	1151011	And that was about it.
1153092	1153793	It rained.
1154212	1154912	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1181570	1183131	Four modems, personally.
1183471	1184772	And then I sit back and laugh.
1206317	1209258	We got our first tornado, like, in ten years.
1209338	1211558	We had a tornado, like, two weeks ago.
1211858	1214479	And people were freaking out, because it actually touched down.
1214919	1220321	Now, granted, I think it maybe, like, picked up a cow and moved it six feet, and that was, like, the extent of the damage.
1220861	1223281	But, yeah, I mean, people were freaking out.
1223301	1225042	They're like, oh my god, a tornado!
1225062	1230783	Just bear in mind, if we suddenly drop, just keep this mental image in mind.
1230803	1234084	We're all piled up in the bathtub, and Rob is on top.
1235342	1236644	Don't you know it, I will be on top.
1236664	1238626	If we drop it means the tornado dropped a cow on us.
1240769	1242531	There's no place like Orange Lounge.
1242571	1243953	There's no place like Orange Lounge.
1244273	1245355	Auntie Em, Auntie Em.
1247136	1256361	No, I wanted to say, I'm surprised by the news about Curves, because my mom stopped going there, because they were playing a lot of, like, Praise Jesus music.
1256901	1259043	Maybe, well, she's too afraid to drive downtown.
1259083	1259863	That's a whole other story.
1260363	1263265	It's really easy to get to, this particular one.
1263365	1270009	I don't know what you would call this, but my mom has a lot of Jewish friends, but she's not Jewish herself.
1270509	1271890	It's kind of like a fag-hag.
1272270	1273050	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1294754	1299998	It was in Roseville, which I realize means nothing to you guys that are out there listening internationally.
1300458	1305982	But imagine a town that is really white and has no culture whatsoever.
1306002	1306562	That's Roseville.
1307143	1309605	And you have to pay long distance to call into Sacramento.
1310045	1310745	Yeah, seriously.
1310825	1314288	Because they're so far removed from reality.
1314488	1317370	There's a Starbucks on every corner.
1317570	1319091	I mean, I don't know how else to put it.
1320432	1320832	Anyway.
1321213	1321453	Sorry.
1322866	1326387	I'm going to keep going for the rest of the week just because I have a free week.
1327328	1334189	I'm going to ask her though if she'll let me do a write-up on it because I'm wanting to promote more fitness for everybody.
1334970	1338391	People need to get off their asses and actually do something for their health.
1338511	1350414	So I'm hoping that I can do a nice write-up on it and encourage people that if... The good thing about this is that it's an all-women gym, so if you're feeling self-conscious...
1351997	1353018	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1370672	1376834	You don't have to worry about a big gym full of people at different, because everybody is going to be at their own fitness level, but everybody is really supportive.
1377414	1385917	So it's a really good place for someone who may be new to exercise, or looking just to lean up a bit, not necessarily bulk up, or is self-conscious.
1387078	1392619	The reason why I was giggling is because they have a guys, they have an all-guy gymnasium called Cuts.
1393020	1394160	Yeah, it's the same thing, I think.
1394694	1395375	Thank you for watching!
1417298	1419839	I'll just start with my week and my day since this kind of leads into it.
1419959	1425503	I was actually apartment hunting today, scouting out where the new home of Orange Lawn Studios will be for a little while.
1427404	1428705	Oh, I thought you said you were done.
1428946	1430367	No, I went to go blow my nose.
1430487	1430947	Oh, I'm sorry.
1430967	1432488	Well, then go ahead and finish and I'll tell my piece.
1433523	1437704	The rest of it was spent working on my wedding, which I sent up for this online wedding thing.
1438284	1441564	They had me budgeted at $15,000, which I find incredibly retarded.
1442685	1443645	I chopped it down to $5,000.
1444205	1448866	And that's just for the essentials of having a very basic ceremony and paying for food.
1450766	1458107	And then I did some house hunting and found out that those online foreclosure sites suck.
1458827	1460808	So I'm going to have to see about getting a bank list somewhere.
1461968	1462508	And now I'm done.
1466147	1469428	Okay, oh yeah, apartment hunting.
1469708	1478232	Okay, so I was apartment hunting today, and me and my buddy Christopher, you know, we're both, you know, if you haven't heard, I happen to be a gay male, and my buddy Christopher is also a gay male.
1478372	1483894	I don't think we exactly exude gay when we go out in public.
1484234	1492698	I mean, I realize people figure me out after spending quality time with me, but I think when I go in in a professional setting, I don't think I'm like, you know...
1493118	1494059	Hi, everybody!
1494199	1496302	You know, I don't think I'm like Richard Simmons gay, okay?
1497423	1501187	Like, I think I'm pretty, you know, quote-unquote, just like everybody else.
1501227	1501867	I don't know how to say it.
1502989	1504030	I'm on low heat, yes.
1504911	1508294	Like, if gayness was an oven setting, I'm like hold warm.
1508594	1508915	That's me.
1508955	1509716	My flames are hold warm.
1509736	1510697	You're not like Lagerfeld.
1511297	1512459	No, I'm not like Karl Lagerfeld.
1512479	1513560	You don't have a fan.
1513580	1515702	No, I don't carry a fucking fan or any of that stuff.
1516147	1520652	So... Well, we went to an apartment complex today.
1521773	1525717	And when we walked in, the guy was like, okay, what kind of size apartment are you interested in getting?
1525757	1527820	And we said, well, maybe like a two or three bedroom.
1527840	1529381	And he's like, oh, you guys don't want a one bedroom?
1529942	1532505	And we were like, uh, it's not like that.
1533526	1534367	And he's like, oh, okay.
1535439	1539062	Like, he just assumed that we were together and we wanted a one-bedroom.
1539082	1545306	And I realize that it's possible for heterosexual males to share a one-bedroom, like college, you know, things like that.
1545326	1546206	That's perfectly normal.
1546547	1551950	But it's like once you get to be 26, you know, unless you're poor.
1551970	1552771	Time to have your own bedroom.
1552871	1555433	Yeah, it's about time to get your own bedroom unless, you know, you're poor.
1555473	1558915	But I like to think I make reasonably good money where I can afford my own bedroom, and so does Christopher.
1559596	1560076	So, anyway.
1560695	1561095	My point.
1562116	1563217	He was giving us the tour.
1563277	1566639	So now we're straight in his minds because he offended us with the gay comment.
1566959	1569941	So we were walking around and he showed us the gymnasium.
1570342	1572423	And there were these two girls and they were pretty attractive.
1572443	1574925	These two girls that were in the gymnasium work it out.
1574945	1577607	And he's like, yeah, we got girls that work out in this gym.
1577627	1579428	And the girls, like you could tell, were embarrassed.
1580248	1581429	And I was just like, oh, those poor girls.
1582270	1585172	And I just wanted to tell them, you have nothing to worry about.
1585332	1587353	I'm not checking you out in that kind of way.
1587493	1589595	I'm strictly looking at the equipment you're using.
1590526	1591226	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1613568	1618452	And so I got to play a little bit of In The Groove, which I've been playing a little more and more of.
1618492	1620494	I'm really trying to warm up to In The Groove.
1621455	1623337	Nothing's really changed on my opinion on it.
1623697	1631363	But I also played Beatmania 3, 6-mix, and I got to watch Andrew play Instant Love, which was the shit, because I love that song.
1633545	1637288	But I was pissed off because the two-player side, all the keys were broken, so I cannot play center mode.
1637688	1640471	And I am a turntable left kind of guy.
1640951	1645754	So that's why Beatmania 5 Key Machines pissed me off because I have to play center and it's all weird.
1646195	1647436	But Left Pride, yo!
1650017	1650778	I guess that's my week.
1650798	1652219	I don't have anything else interesting to share.
1653420	1654460	Left Pride my ass.
1654801	1655381	You know what?
1656282	1658003	You want to settle this with a cream corn match?
1659218	1659378	No.
1659558	1661039	Alright, this could be our first dispute.
1661240	1662901	This could be our first official dispute.
1664962	1665242	Alright.
1665543	1667704	Wow, I feel all official and shit.
1667964	1669586	Okay, let me go to the pantry and get some corn.
1669686	1670446	Magus, you have a mic.
1670466	1671347	Tell us about your week and your day.
1672368	1672768	Alright.
1673669	1676391	Just, well, mostly all the same.
1676471	1678452	Work, school, work, school, work, school.
1679733	1680814	Finally got sick of it.
1680934	1681995	Took a weekend off.
1682095	1685477	Went to Rekakon yesterday.
1685557	1686458	Shoutouts to everyone there.
1687442	1696968	Uh, came in day after just completely blowing my legs out on DDR, and the rest is going on right now.
1698489	1699750	Nothing much to talk about, though.
1703332	1704733	Alright, how boring you are.
1705013	1705494	Just kidding.
1706354	1707415	He's a working boy now.
1707975	1711137	Jamie, this boy has grown up so fast, right before our eyes.
1713479	1713799	Good.
1715731	1717853	I smell a repressed dot dot frickin dot.
1717913	1720795	Remember when he was an angsty little Republican asshole?
1721476	1724518	Now he's only a semi-angsty Republican asshole.
1724678	1726219	With a sense of responsibility.
1727881	1729682	That's okay, we'll beat the partisanship out of you.
1729702	1730303	Andrew, you know I love you.
1730323	1732445	It's not like I'm crawling in my skin or anything.
1732525	1733305	You know I love you.
1734386	1735407	In a heterosexual way.
1735947	1737249	In a heterosexual top-heavy way.
1738269	1738530	Angel!
1739330	1740331	Hey, as long as it's top-heavy.
1741032	1741332	Angel.
1743113	1743774	You're weak in your day.
1744201	1744821	Stop laughing!
1745762	1746262	Can't help it.
1748063	1749504	Stop laughing, this is a serious discussion.
1750764	1751245	Oh, really?
1751845	1753546	You're the one holding nachos in your lap.
1754566	1755067	Anyway.
1755607	1756888	I don't think they needed to know that.
1757208	1759229	No, but, yeah, they were just there.
1759309	1759609	Whatever.
1761490	1766292	I don't know, I just work and school, and I had finals this week, so, yay.
1766833	1769354	Half of my school days are...
1770134	1771094	What does RECA stand for?
1771114	1773795	Residents of East Contra Costa County Anime
1796520	1799882	I wanted to go!
1800322	1801743	I saw we.
1801943	1807085	If anybody that went to RekkaCon is listening, please don't tell me how fabulous the convention was because I'm quite bitter.
1808346	1808786	I'm just kidding.
1808806	1809266	I'll get over it.
1809286	1810287	Wendell sends his love.
1811227	1812708	And Jahi and everyone else.
1812908	1817850	I'm going to play the Step Squad promo after the next break so I can hear them.
1818811	1819531	Everyone was there.
1819551	1820051	It was cool.
1821952	1823193	I got chased by an agent.
1823333	1823933	That was weird.
1825979	1828282	Oh, I thought you said I got chased by an Asian.
1828462	1828662	No.
1828762	1830164	I'm like, what?
1830404	1832066	We had an Agent Smith cosplayer.
1832586	1832706	Oh.
1833527	1837431	Let's just say he's been discouraging me from playing MXO lately.
1838593	1841095	My... You were playing Nestor.
1843137	1843958	I sense a dispute.
1844819	1845059	Cream corn.
1845099	1847101	And every time I see a pedestrian, I'm...
1847961	1849302	Out of curiosity, how is MXO?
1849322	1851564	I saw Loki play it for like 15 minutes, but that was about it.
1851584	1852985	And that was your MMO update.
1853025	1853725	Sorry, Angel.
1879294	1881075	As I just taunted in front of the mic, that was funny.
1881315	1883097	Alright, let's see.
1883297	1885959	Yeah, Rekkon yesterday, CCL last night.
1886079	1887880	Yay for CCL or something.
1888420	1889561	Damn those card systems.
1889641	1890142	Damn them.
1890922	1892243	Those stupid cards wouldn't rate.
1892263	1893304	And I'm going, what the hell?
1894365	1894885	Oh, I know.
1894945	1896967	What is up with arcades that use cards?
1897438	1901500	Yeah, cards with a little magnetic strip on the back so it makes it look like, you know, it's all important or something.
1901540	1904121	And then the card for CCL is ugly, too.
1904641	1909143	I'm going to go put the card up on the webcam, www.orangelonsradio.com.
1909203	1910744	It's not fugly, it's more fugly.
1912185	1913645	People are wondering what MXO is.
1913745	1914946	The Matrix Online.
1915826	1916086	Yes.
1917927	1918788	Put the card on the cam.
1920510	1924612	And other than that, not much except for coming to the show today.
1924752	1927573	So, there's not that much in my life going on.
1928574	1928854	Yet.
1929734	1930174	Or something.
1930234	1931775	Except for Spring Break starting tomorrow.
1933336	1934436	Yay, Spring Break!
1934516	1934977	Woohoo!
1936637	1939739	Where I'm going to do nothing but play MMOs all week or something.
1941540	1941800	What?
1942560	1944701	You're not going to Nude Beach, you dumbass.
1948692	1949052	Really?
1949112	1949832	Screw the nude beach.
1949872	1952293	I'm going to go to Curves because they all exercise topless there.
1956154	1956894	At the nude beach?
1956974	1957574	Heck yeah.
1961716	1962256	Alright, anyway.
1964936	1965477	Is that it, Angel?
1965617	1965817	Yes.
1966197	1966417	Oh, okay.
1966457	1966717	Sorry.
1966937	1967297	That's alright.
1967417	1968437	Hand the mic off to Loki.
1969358	1972218	Why, Loki, why do you have gummy bears stuck to your forehead?
1972298	1974119	I don't... What the hell?
1974459	1975099	I was bored.
1975119	1975659	I don't know.
1976900	1978080	Because they stick.
1979980	1980420	That's why.
1980440	1984663	Yeah, it's because I touch myself at night.
1986745	1987125	I don't know.
1987145	1989707	It's pretty stuck.
1990047	1991868	Want to eat it off?
1992489	1993349	Oh, that is gross!
1993589	1994350	Oh my god!
1994830	1997072	Such blatant heterosexuality in my home.
1997672	2007359	Anyways, just so you guys know, because this isn't TV, Loki's fiance just ate the gummy bear off of his forehead and totally licked his forehead in the process.
2007639	2008620	You don't know where that's been.
2009748	2011629	Ew, breeders.
2012170	2015333	I put worse things in my mouth off his body.
2016494	2018396	Can we... Do we have a bleeper?
2018536	2020338	Do we have a dump button or a bleeper?
2021218	2022940	Anyways... Oh wait, I forgot we're internet.
2023280	2025803	No, so... What did I do this week?
2026604	2026944	Not much.
2027004	2029026	I interviewed for my games position.
2029086	2030027	I did really well.
2030387	2030928	What are you doing?
2032349	2033310	And, um, so...
2035015	2035655	I did not break it.
2035695	2037476	It was faulty craftsmanship.
2037496	2038096	Do not shop at Zale's.
2064420	2065121	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2076175	2078857	You just eat them and you want more and more and more.
2079117	2081759	Mall pretzels are the shit with like the mustard.
2082419	2085902	Mrs. Fields, pretzel time pretzels are the fucking bomb.
2086182	2089785	You eat them and you're just like, need more, more, crack, more.
2090005	2092827	You can get those huge soft like pretzels at Costco.
2093327	2094348	Yeah, they're not the same.
2094648	2095569	Not the same at all.
2095589	2096630	I know, but they're close.
2096650	2097190	They're so good.
2097490	2100933	It's like, I bought four one time and I ate them all.
2101393	2105276	And when I got full, I waited until I became unful and I ate them at rest.
2105416	2105696	It's just,
2106218	2108259	That's like me and drumsticks.
2108499	2110100	Like the ice cream cones.
2110220	2110520	I know.
2110540	2111841	They're so good.
2112261	2113602	So then what else did we do this week?
2114603	2127730	We got the apartment stuff finalized so we're going to be moving into our place on the 16th of next month and then I know there's some other stuff I did.
2128130	2130672	Loki and I will no longer be living together as of next month.
2130712	2131172	Freedom!
2131692	2134994	And I'll be living with Nellie.
2136316	2139658	Aw, wait a minute, you're moving in together before you're married?
2141078	2143580	Oh, sinners living in sin!
2144580	2144940	Whatever.
2145160	2149402	Okay, anyways, so, um... How did you know the name of our apartment complex?
2150943	2154405	So, um, we're at... My household will be all gay.
2154425	2156386	Ew!
2156446	2158287	We should move into, like, the same thing.
2158647	2160408	Anyway, sorry, we keep cutting Loki off.
2161948	2162929	Anyways, um...
2163880	2169044	So I played a lot of Final Fantasy this week, as usual, just because I can't.
2169424	2176570	I would be playing other games, but some person hasn't returned my Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, so I haven't been able to play that.
2176930	2178631	So I got bored and I bought more games.
2178972	2186417	I bought Dog's Life and Gran Turismo 4, and I must say I can't drive for shit in Gran Turismo 4.
2187218	2191842	The first thing you do, and I don't know why people do this, at least I did, is you drive your car.
2192282	2193623	You pick your car in the game.
2194392	2196732	And so I picked my Ford Focus, and guess what?
2197153	2197973	It sucks!
2198653	2199753	It's not a race car!
2200473	2205514	Then I was playing the rally mode, where you basically... Well, as a reminder, you own a Ford.
2206514	2206795	Whatever.
2207115	2220617	Anyway, so I was playing the rally mode, whatever, versus, like, they had some, like, really nice Subaru rally car, you know, versus the boat that I picked, and obviously the rally car beat my boat, and that pissed me off.
2221597	2224058	So, yeah, so, anyways...
2224542	2228083	But I'll talk more about those games on the podcast, which you can download every week.
2228924	2238907	So yeah, I did that, and all I must say, a little teaser for the podcast, I've been throwing poop on cars.
2241368	2242048	Poop on cars.
2242088	2242909	He's not kidding.
2243469	2243949	Not kidding.
2245650	2249611	As a dog, I've taken shits in places I've never known that I could take shits in.
2251092	2251592	And so...
2252492	2253293	It's a very fun game.
2253414	2254495	You guys, seriously try it.
2254616	2255918	And Gran Turismo 4, beautiful.
2257681	2259504	Gran Turismo 4 is a sexy game.
2259904	2260846	It looks very sexy.
2261066	2263911	They have like this like, really like, operatic, you know, like,
2264770	2267011	Music in the beginning, and I'm like, what the hell?
2267952	2270893	But I missed the Cardigan song that was in Gran Turismo 2.
2271113	2274334	They have Crystal Method in this game, which is pretty cool.
2274735	2280557	I haven't seen the soundtrack list yet, but they had some Crystal Method in there, and that was kind of neat.
2281398	2285820	And, I don't know, it's just fun stuff, playing a few sim files.
2287540	2291162	Once again, my wrist was sore from playing Step Mania.
2291182	2291462	Meh.
2291922	2292303	Meh.
2292863	2293023	Meh.
2293666	2295246	Hey, I'm getting better, okay?
2296387	2300327	You know, pretty soon... No, I've got masturbation down.
2300367	2301828	I'm talking about step mania.
2302808	2303708	I'm not worried about that.
2304768	2306829	You already AAA'd masturbation, sorry.
2306909	2307489	Exactly.
2308509	2311330	Oh, by the way, I should mention this because it was quite funny.
2311670	2313510	I found out... No, not masturbation.
2313910	2317071	I found out last week my mom was listening to our show.
2318711	2321232	Oh, yeah, maybe I should stop saying... And masturbating?
2321812	2323312	I should stop saying things like that.
2326581	2337751	So, if Matthew's mom is listening, Matthew has never masturbated in his life, and he's never looked at a girl with impure thoughts, and he gets straight A's in school.
2338792	2339452	How good is school?
2340994	2343776	Remember that one time she walked in on you?
2343876	2344937	She's gonna... Oh my god!
2346218	2349161	You're gonna have to fight
2350723	2353544	This is why Nelly doesn't get a microphone on this show.
2355204	2358665	I still think the mic picked that up, but... I think it did.
2360305	2361665	Judging by the reaction.
2361685	2372528	I am at a loss for words.
2372828	2375388	I just... I don't know what to say.
2375408	2375888	Not anymore.
2376188	2379049	She needs my sister to help her, you know, with finding stuff.
2382861	2383882	She's not in the chat room.
2383982	2385483	She wouldn't even know how to get in the chat room.
2385663	2387004	Seriously, MPQ's got a point.
2387044	2389105	This is why you don't tell your parents what you do on the internet.
2389165	2390246	But, you know what?
2390526	2391467	Parents find out.
2392107	2395870	Just like they find out about masturbation, they find out about your radio show on the internet.
2395890	2397411	I'm a freaking adult, okay?
2397471	2398131	It doesn't matter.
2398812	2399272	Whatever.
2400113	2400433	Yeah.
2403195	2404035	Anyways, I'm done.
2404135	2404676	That's all I did.
2405136	2405376	Alright.
2406417	2408078	Nellie, you want to share anything about your week and your day?
2409219	2409319	No.
2409339	2409519	Okay.
2411000	2411100	Um...
2412170	2416012	Before we get a break, we are going to go to a break pretty soon here, but I want to bring up some news.
2416872	2418113	I do want to talk about Bomani news.
2418133	2419073	We'll get to that after the break.
2419453	2438781	I want to talk about this, because I know a lot of Bomani nerds are into this series as well, and this is definitely worth mentioning, but it's been a little mentioned in Nintendo Power, a little tiny, little slip in Namco's upcoming calendar says that Katamari Damacy DS is on the way.
2440122	2440442	So...
2440982	2442623	Something for you guys to think about there.
2442643	2445426	And my question is, how in the hell are you going to control that?
2445546	2446466	That's going to be weird.
2446586	2447667	Stylus, hello.
2447707	2451070	Is it going to be that faux analog thing like Mario 64 has?
2451570	2452991	Well, here's how it's going to work.
2453452	2454172	It's quite simple.
2454593	2461358	You're going to have, you know, not faux analog, but you're going to have the directional button and you have your four buttons.
2461398	2463820	Those are your two sticks right there.
2464600	2467242	Either that or you can use the stylus to roll it.
2467303	2469064	You just kind of move the stylus.
2471087	2474748	You could just keep rolling it forward to the side using the stylus.
2474788	2475508	I guess that would work.
2476969	2480029	It's nice that the DS is going to get a game.
2481010	2484130	We keep hearing about all this cool stuff that's going to come out on the DS.
2485231	2497334	Yesterday when I was at GameStop looking at games, I looked at the wall of all the stuff that's supposed to be launching with the PSP, and then I walked over to the DS section, and it was literally half a shelf.
2497964	2498765	Not even a shelf.
2498845	2500046	It was a small shelf.
2500426	2502488	They had maybe ten games.
2502948	2503388	Maybe.
2503468	2504729	And that was everything that's out right now.
2504749	2506851	I'm like, God, the DS sucks.
2507732	2511315	But the thing is, is that the DS as a system, it doesn't suck.
2511535	2513636	I mean... Well, they released some games then.
2513656	2515898	I don't know, because they're bastard people.
2515998	2517560	I have no other explanation for that.
2517760	2518140	You know what?
2518180	2521323	Other systems did the exact same thing, and it failed horribly.
2521463	2523284	Please don't say Engage, or I'll hate you forever.
2525911	2527992	No, those both sucked from launch.
2528072	2531453	But I'm talking about Nintendo 64.
2531673	2533014	That failed as a system.
2533634	2535815	And it's because there wasn't that many games out for it.
2536015	2538696	And also Atari Lynx.
2538756	2541858	But it did have Pokemon Snap.
2542598	2544239	Yeah, Pokemon Dash out right now.
2546280	2549601	The thing about the DS is that it does have a lot of good games coming soon.
2550442	2551763	Animal Crossing DS, coming soon.
2551783	2552744	Oh yeah, September.
2552904	2553784	Woo, fun.
2554244	2555966	That's assuming they don't push it back.
2556246	2556986	I know, I know.
2558787	2561169	See, the problem with DS, though, is it's a new technology.
2561329	2564711	Not everyone knows how to market for dual screens.
2565632	2567353	Not everyone is willing to take the plunge.
2568213	2570915	I mean, PSP, everyone knows how to do one screen.
2571715	2572096	Yeah.
2572656	2574257	Castlevania DS will make it all better.
2574277	2577199	Castlevania DS will be my god when it's out.
2577359	2577559	I know.
2578570	2580611	Speaking of PSP, is anybody planning on picking one up?
2581511	2582612	I already have ours reserved.
2583452	2586193	Do you guys have a demo in the house because of what your man does?
2586373	2587974	Nobody's got one at the store.
2588234	2588654	Oh, right on.
2589015	2590075	Has he given you any feedback on it?
2590615	2591376	He said it was fun.
2591976	2592896	Have you gotten to play it at all yet?
2592916	2596118	I haven't really been all that excited about playing it.
2596798	2604762	I want a PSP, but I don't want it right now because I just have too much other shit going on, which sucks because I wish somebody would just send me a free one.
2604782	2605642	I need Wipeout Pure.
2606874	2608455	There are a lot of... Oh, see, I want Lumines.
2610456	2611997	I would buy it for Metal Gear Acid.
2612937	2615499	See, all these cool games coming out, like, right around launch period.
2615699	2619301	And then the DS, like... What did we get at launch?
2619341	2621742	We got Mario, which was cool, but it was a rehashed game.
2622482	2623363	Spider-Man 2.
2624303	2625084	Whoop-de-doo!
2625224	2626044	Feel the magic.
2626665	2627485	Fun for about five minutes.
2627505	2628185	Fun, fun, fun, fun.
2628306	2628866	For about five minutes.
2628886	2629546	Mr. Driller DS.
2631067	2632408	And eventually we're getting some fun stuff.
2632428	2633168	But Mr. Driller's been done.
2633188	2634249	WarioWare Twisted.
2634909	2635569	Sorry, Touched.
2635770	2636510	Touched is already out.
2637268	2638611	We've finally gotten to that.
2641055	2643819	Castlevania DS will be out soon, supposedly.
2643839	2644080	Mario Kart
2649275	2651776	I'm a long-term gamer and the battery life thing is still kind of... No.
2674881	2676562	Alright, we're going to take a break.
2676902	2679944	In this break, I promised DarkSakura we'd do some forest style music.
2679964	2681805	That's exactly what we're going to do.
2681945	2683246	And we're going to start off with Empathy.
2684307	2685167	Because that song is rad.
2686508	2690330	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and some news on night style.
2690490	2693192	And, you know, that kind of involves indirectly some news from forest style.
2693212	2695694	So we'll be back after this with Orange Lounge Radio.
2762026	2762836	Thanks for watching!
2941463	2941957	Thank you.
3143317	3146578	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3146638	3146858	Wee!
3164704	3166227	Taku, Empathy, LED, Infinite Prayer, The Floating Flocks
3177383	3182666	DJ Taka featuring Jasmine, Final Countdown, and Ryu with StarMine.
3182706	3195073	And Ryu, one of those interesting guys because he had that song in 4th style and then disappeared for a long ass time and then came back and I don't remember if it was 9th or 10th, but he disappeared for a while and then just recently came back to the series.
3195173	3197314	So, hope you enjoyed that stuff from 4th style.
3197754	3202977	And yes, 2DX 9th style is on people's minds right now because...
3203891	3205031	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3226815	3229556	Hopefully some of you guys out there may already have been seeing it.
3230196	3231797	If you haven't, though, you're going to be getting that very soon.
3231977	3236679	I know I need to get my copy still, but as I may have mentioned before, I'm poor.
3237079	3238519	So I won't be getting it for a little while.
3238840	3239960	But hopefully soon.
3241161	3245322	DarkSakura, I know you usually pick up a lot of the new 2DX styles as they come out.
3245342	3246943	Are you getting this one?
3246963	3248223	Yeah, I just didn't pre-order it.
3248823	3252885	I know you're not huge on 9th style, so I don't know if you maybe passed on it or what.
3253105	3255506	I honestly didn't care about 9th style, but I'm going to get it.
3257776	3259057	Just to be a perfectionist, right?
3259137	3260298	Or a completionist, I should say.
3260318	3261618	Yeah, but I'm still missing Forthstyle.
3262439	3263139	Well, I guess that's true.
3263159	3264520	But Forthstyle's a little harder to find.
3265821	3266181	Not really.
3266281	3266481	Really?
3266521	3267002	I thought it was.
3267562	3268082	I can find it.
3268283	3268603	Oh, rad.
3268623	3269843	I just haven't spent the money on it.
3270304	3274987	But Forthstyle's going to be on the back burner because I have to get Vibriple.
3276087	3276187	Oh.
3277188	3277488	Cool.
3277728	3280230	And I still need to find Mojibribbon, but that one's been kind of out.
3283482	3286785	Let's see, four style songs that are coming back into Night Style.
3286805	3288367	There's a lot of repeats.
3288407	3297715	If you check out the official Night Style Consumer Version website, konamistudio.co.jp slash bm2, the number two, dx2.
3298835	3307919	It actually has a whole big song list.
3308259	3309960	So some of the songs coming back from 4Style.
3309980	3310580	Just some of them.
3310620	3311320	The ones I recognize.
3311421	3312181	Empathy, of course.
3312521	3314902	Kamikaze is coming back.
3315782	3317763	This one is interesting, I think, from 3Style.
3317863	3319204	Dong Teppo, number one.
3319364	3319964	Remember that one?
3320704	3321305	I hate that song.
3321325	3322385	That song was hilarious.
3323105	3327167	And Macho Gang by Anal Spider is coming back.
3327765	3328726	No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
3329546	3330526	No, no, no, no, no, no.
3331067	3332948	I love the Hamburger Helper video that goes along with that.
3333768	3337990	Some very interesting consumer tracks making their way into the Night Style Home version.
3338010	3341592	A couple LED tracks, including Jaeger Final Attack.
3342421	3344541	and another song called Photoingenic.
3345101	3351523	And then LED usually teams up with Groovy, but actually Groovy has their own song featuring No Plus Chin.
3352423	3356883	5PM Eternal is a song that they have in the Night Style.
3356923	3358524	So again, for the full list, you can head on over there.
3359004	3362344	All the brand new Night Style songs are making their way to the home version.
3362484	3366305	I believe they stopped doing the license thing with Night Style.
3366325	3367985	At least I haven't noticed anything missing.
3368505	3370486	If there was something missing, then I just didn't notice it.
3371346	3371426	Um...
3372206	3374788	My only concern is that Bad Boy Bass made it in.
3377809	3381632	And Bad Boy Bass did make it in, so that was my only concern, because it's my favorite Nightstyle song.
3382792	3392358	And then, of course, I'm sure Lionski, for those of you guys that are into Kiriyamaoka, and who can blame you, I'm sure that song also is making its debut, along with the video in Nightstyle.
3392378	3395640	So, good times there for 2DX Nightstyle.
3396100	3397581	Angel, I know you're really into 2DX as well.
3397601	3399342	What are your thoughts on the Nightstyle release this week?
3400808	3402429	I want it, but I need to get 8th first.
3403770	3404771	So I'm a little behind.
3404951	3406932	Okay, I'm a lot... Well, I'm not that behind.
3407433	3410615	I just need 8th and 9th now, so... You know.
3411956	3413156	Plus I need to practice more, too.
3415678	3417119	Practice makes perfect.
3417880	3421642	Uh, Loki, I know you hate 2DX, but any interest in this whatsoever?
3423864	3424624	Uh, mic's not on, bud.
3424644	3427266	I don't hate 2DX, but, uh...
3431002	3433043	Someone's breaking the mic!
3433183	3433684	Sounds fine.
3434744	3436906	I know that, but there's pieces of metal jetting out.
3437206	3437566	Oh, yuck.
3438307	3440108	And the top part's coming off.
3440468	3440748	Uh-oh.
3442129	3442469	Hooray!
3442689	3442949	Anyway.
3444891	3445371	My thoughts.
3447032	3447752	It's another game.
3448032	3448293	Yay.
3451495	3451755	Yeah.
3453296	3453696	Hooray.
3453876	3455017	Another 2DX game.
3455517	3457438	How have they made it any better?
3458038	3458839	Nope, they haven't.
3460396	3461857	I just want to know about the timing.
3461917	3464580	I want to get some feedback on how the timing is.
3464620	3467002	Unfortunately, I haven't had the time today to read the message boards.
3467382	3473248	I'm hoping that when we open up the Skype line later, maybe some folks might already know about if the timing got better from the arcade.
3474168	3484097	Actually, I want to say we did have somebody was saying, I think it was Siggy or somebody on the Skype line a couple weeks back was saying that the timing is somewhat better, which I hope is true.
3485959	3486239	Anyway...
3488652	3489873	So that's it for Night Style.
3489913	3491594	I really don't have a whole lot else to add to that.
3491995	3496338	So, anybody else have any exciting Night Style related news?
3497139	3499741	I kind of want the Deluxe set.
3500301	3501002	What is coming in?
3501082	3502283	I don't even remember what's coming in.
3502303	3507547	It's got a DVD, the VRare 10, and a sticker book.
3508348	3508568	Ooh.
3510630	3513092	When I saw sticker book, I was like, I don't want stickers.
3514272	3517315	I almost bought the Papa Music 9, the Deluxe set.
3518405	3519306	Ooh, that was pretty cool.
3519326	3520487	Because I wanted a teacup.
3521728	3524410	But I ended up buying right-hands instead.
3524850	3531876	You know another song that shows up in Night Style Consumer is Number 13 by Taco with Respect for JSB.
3532537	3536140	And that would be one of them preview tracks from a future 2DX style.
3536680	3537421	So that's kind of cool.
3537461	3540123	I'm kind of glad that that is showing up.
3540443	3541344	I like seeing preview songs.
3541364	3545127	I'm just glad we're getting more 2DX, but now they need to start bringing out the Guitadora.
3545538	3547900	It's weird that they've all been coming out like back to back.
3547960	3552464	Like we went years with no 2DX at home and then suddenly, bam, 7th, 8th, now 9th.
3552484	3553766	Oops, we fucked up.
3553846	3563394	And you know that if this does well, which I assume it will because it's got a pretty big following here in the States, 10th will be out probably by the end of summer, which is rock.
3564215	3565496	Because 10th style is pretty cool too.
3565516	3567198	I have to have my Gradius.
3567566	3572709	Remember back in the day when they're like, We don't make you seven style unless you vote!
3573149	3574070	And if you buy!
3575031	3576331	Or else we don't make!
3576612	3580334	Yes, I remember that, that they were saying, And now they're like, Oh, you like!
3580374	3581354	You buy the game!
3581374	3582955	We make more for you!
3584876	3586077	Thank you, thank you for that.
3586197	3589739	You can address those cards and letters to matt at orangelawnsradio.com, by the way.
3593742	3593822	Um...
3595652	3600514	You know, I just, I kind of hope that they're still going to come out in the arcade as well, like 2DX Red.
3600534	3605596	I still haven't gotten a chance to play Red, but I'm kind of hoping to when I get to go down to L.A.
3605696	3606296	in a couple weeks.
3606636	3607496	So, we'll see.
3607997	3612958	And then hopefully that'll be out for home by early next year, so at the rate things are going, that'll be pretty cool.
3614099	3618320	I don't know, do you think there's any room for 2DX to evolve in the near future?
3618540	3621622	Or beat, I guess I should say, maybe not necessarily 2DX, but Beatmania?
3622922	3624903	Even though Beatmania, the 5D version...
3626977	3627677	Been there, done that.
3627717	3628658	Keyboard Mania doubles.
3628718	3629018	Hello.
3632798	3634399	They can come with an ice cream dispenser.
3634439	3636339	Typing of the beat.
3637299	3638080	No, they did that.
3638140	3638620	Remember that?
3638640	3639740	Beat Mania, da, da, da.
3640100	3641700	Yeah.
3641720	3642681	Da, da, da.
3643201	3643541	Exactly.
3643621	3644541	Dot, dot, dot.
3644821	3646481	I heard it was total crap, too.
3647282	3649522	I like that Lupin typing game.
3650456	3650996	I want to play that.
3651016	3652276	I have Typing of the Dead at home.
3652497	3657658	I'm sad that there was not any more keyboard manias that came out.
3657898	3658818	Speaking of 50-key.
3659998	3660919	I like keyboard manias.
3660979	3662479	Whatever happened to the para-para?
3662619	3664179	Or dance maniacs, for that matter.
3664399	3666620	Because the pata-pata craze has died down in Japan.
3667960	3671001	Yeah, I heard rumors that Velfire just ain't what it used to be.
3671721	3678383	Well, Velfire was a club, just a regular club anyway, that as far as I'm aware just did pata-pata on certain nights.
3679063	3679283	Right.
3682254	3683174	I don't have anything to add to that.
3683194	3683875	I'm still going to go there.
3684335	3684855	I wish that.
3685196	3690559	I think it would be hilarious that if, like, in San Francisco or something, there was actually a bar where they did that as well.
3690659	3691540	I just think that would be hilarious.
3691840	3694802	I mean, if people can fucking country line dance, why can't they para para?
3694902	3695342	Seriously?
3696003	3697724	You look just as stupid doing either one.
3698925	3699645	Maybe it's just me.
3699966	3701247	Para para, though, is kind of cool.
3701267	3702207	It's like cheerleading, though.
3703928	3704629	Kind of.
3706510	3707351	It's all happy.
3707371	3709192	And not boot scootin'.
3710177	3717500	Like, I go to karaoke and some lesbian will get up there and start singing a country song like, you know, Don't Break My Heart, Mike.
3717660	3718221	No, I'm just kidding.
3718261	3718801	Nobody sings that.
3718821	3720102	But like, they'll sing Dixie Chicks or something.
3720482	3723463	And people start country line dancing and I'm like, that's so weird.
3725364	3725904	I don't know why.
3725944	3727225	I shouldn't hate, but it's weird.
3727245	3728145	There's the straights!
3728245	3728626	Get them!
3733508	3734608	It makes perfect sense.
3735309	3736709	Gay people don't line dance.
3736849	3738310	It's documented in books.
3742222	3748508	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3766141	3766541	Really?
3766982	3767963	Now that's surprising.
3768043	3772146	I would think that square dancing would be like a whole class in Alabama that you take for units.
3774347	3775348	Just teasing.
3775728	3775989	I know.
3776429	3777510	You know what you can do with that finger.
3779431	3780312	I have plenty of ideas.
3780912	3781913	Pleasure a sheep?
3785756	3787618	Hit him, please.
3788438	3789059	Because I can't.
3792381	3793302	That's solid metal.
3796339	3796900	Oh, it's hot.
3826187	3827588	Summer 2005, quote-unquote.
3829228	3832889	There is a pre-order bonus that you can get.
3835350	3843093	An In The Groove soundtrack, an In The Groove t-shirt, a Red Octane temporary tattoo, so you can be cool.
3843333	3844934	Wow, lame!
3844994	3849995	Put on that Red Octane tattoo and go to the Harley Davidson bar and show how cool you are.
3850676	3852556	A Red Octane keychain.
3852576	3853937	Ooh!
3854710	3862493	You know, this is like crap that they made that they tried to give away at conventions, and it couldn't go anywhere, and they're like, what are we going to do with all this crap?
3862733	3864093	I know, let's give it away!
3864173	3864874	Woo!
3865094	3866054	And free shipping.
3868135	3874637	And of course, as expected, there will be an In the Groove bundle, which will be the game, and an ignition pad.
3874657	3876078	Will it be as glitchy as the arcade?
3877718	3878338	I'm not sure.
3878358	3879199	Is that one of the features?
3879619	3880139	I'm not sure.
3881573	3884536	You know what I figured out about In The Groove for the first time when I was playing yesterday?
3885597	3895125	If you actually sit and you watch the attract mode, it actually shows pictures of all the people who made the game, and then like pictures of all these people gathered up at the arcade.
3896341	3899263	I saw eight on the break in there, and I was like, oh, I played that machine.
3899303	3899883	That's kind of neat.
3900063	3907267	It was kind of neat in a way, but at the same time, I was kind of like, wow, these guys credit themselves as step chart makers.
3907667	3910589	They credit themselves in the credits of the game.
3911069	3913590	They credit themselves in the opening sequence of the game.
3914731	3919994	Not that you shouldn't get a little credit, because these games take a lot of work, but
3921201	3929970	I don't know, it seems like most other games I've played have a little bit of a hold warm when it comes to that stuff.
3930110	3931671	A little less, not so much.
3933373	3935335	I don't know.
3935435	3937077	I'm going to get the hate mail.
3937437	3938538	I'm not dogging on in the group.
3938819	3941081	I'm actually starting to warm up to the game a little bit.
3941161	3944264	I'm finding the five songs I really like to play over and over again.
3944825	3945025	So...
3945949	3947151	I'm having a good time.
3947211	3948392	And my scores are getting better.
3948733	3950855	I'm getting used to that wacky scrolling thing.
3951416	3952497	The way it scrolls initially.
3952918	3954820	Angel, you had to play in the group for the first time this week.
3954840	3955261	What did you think?
3956405	3956945	I suck.
3958365	3959286	I suck bad.
3959786	3960126	I don't know.
3960406	3970427	I find the arrows, like, really small for, you know, the way, because I can't see that well, and just, you know, having small arrows kind of makes it hard.
3970928	3973448	So I had to follow by color, which doesn't exactly work.
3974208	3982510	But I figure with practice I will try to get better at the game, assuming we get to go again.
3982810	3984590	So, other than that,
3985720	3988821	I didn't know any of the music or anything, so that didn't help.
3988881	3990442	Rob was like, pick a song, pick a song.
3990462	3992823	I'm like, I don't know what I want to play, just pick one.
3994843	4000865	I guess as I play the game, I'll get to know the songs and I'll feel a little bit more comfortable with it.
4002046	4004066	Other than that, yeah, it's okay.
4005167	4009308	It's still a rip-off, but it's still okay.
4009428	4011069	Andrew, you got to play it for the first time as well.
4011089	4012269	What were your thoughts on IndieGroove?
4013322	4014723	That was pretty well done.
4014743	4022450	It did seem a little bit glitchy, but actually it plays like a finished product.
4022510	4024872	Now, glitchy is a very vague word.
4024892	4025932	What do you mean with glitchy?
4027574	4033719	Just some basic timing stuff, because I was listening to the songs and some steps just didn't match.
4035160	4036942	So it mostly could be just a step chart problem.
4036962	4038263	Well, now that's a step chart glitch.
4039023	4042266	Could be just step charts to me, but it actually plays like a finished product.
4045950	4046030	D.D.R.
4070807	4075229	Just patron of an arcade, a teenager, they're all the same.
4075289	4082211	Maybe I'm not giving the average user of the arcade enough credit, but I always thought every dance game was the same to most people that aren't in this scene.
4085392	4088733	Here's what I've always said, one leg up that DDR has on In the Groove.
4089073	4090734	Does In the Groove have more challenging steps?
4090814	4091014	Yes.
4091054	4091514	Does it have a
4092395	4094436	DDR is all sweetness and light and candy!
4117172	4119313	And I don't know, I think that attracts people to it more.
4120814	4121954	In a completely superficial way.
4121974	4124815	It brings people out of the dark shadows that are with their lives.
4125215	4127076	Another thing is, it looked very plain.
4128357	4129357	Very plain.
4129877	4131698	I mean, just even the arrows are plain.
4131938	4133199	The interface is plain.
4133259	4134019	It's just plain.
4134859	4139261	I mean, whereas you can get some interfaces like a lot of the Step Mania skins I've seen out there.
4139801	4140882	They're really cool looking.
4141162	4143083	And they're really, you know, complex looking.
4143143	4145704	They're really, you know, like, wow, I gotta play that game.
4145744	4146404	It looks cool.
4147136	4151138	versus, wow, it's another dancing game.
4151518	4152079	Yay.
4153299	4161604	Wow, we've got to include all this crap to get you to buy this game because we're going to fail when it comes to selling against DDR.
4161924	4162284	But you know what?
4162324	4166887	People are going to buy this game because they're going to be like, oh, I've got to put it in the group so they make more games.
4168327	4169208	It's just, no.
4169728	4171049	It's whatever.
4171649	4173370	I'm very curious to see how it plays.
4174690	4179152	I'm curious to see how it plays out, too, because I think it is going to be competition.
4179492	4180732	We got into this a couple weeks ago.
4180772	4187694	I don't want to revisit, but I think the Red Octane partnership is going to prove it's going to make in the group some serious competition.
4187734	4188235	I really do.
4188575	4191676	And I think the game is good enough, certainly, where it can.
4192236	4199158	It's not like we're talking it's Mad Catz dance craze or whatever that fucking game was on GameCube that sucks.
4199418	4200799	It's a good dance game.
4200859	4201719	Does it have flaws?
4202179	4202479	Yeah.
4202859	4203640	But is it good?
4203660	4204360	Is it solid?
4205000	4205860	Surprisingly so.
4206701	4208321	So, we'll see.
4209102	4209542	We shall see.
4211122	4213804	Okay, well, I'm getting blink, blink, blinks.
4214784	4215184	I don't know.
4215944	4219586	I guess we'll do a break time, then we'll come back, maybe do some Skype line.
4219906	4220446	How does that sound?
4221227	4222227	Let our listeners talk back?
4222247	4222667	Yeah, good work.
4222967	4223627	Alright, we'll do that.
4223808	4226729	So we're going to go to a break, we're going to come back, we're going to let you guys interact with our show.
4226749	4233171	www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us, and we'll be taking some calls when we get back from this break.
4233692	4234532	In this break...
4235632	4240054	Pope Puri, whatever I feel like playing, and whatever Jamie tells me to play.
4241015	4246458	And we're going to start it off with, since we've been doing 2DX all night, I think it's time to do some DDR.
4248539	4250199	Oh, wow.
4250680	4251740	I will get that in there, Jamie.
4252761	4257203	Let's start it off with, I want to start off with something from Xtreme.
4257863	4259204	We'll do some Blue Impulse.
4261125	4262746	Oh, fuck, I have a story about Bag.
4262766	4262866	Yeah.
4265124	4265925	I'll tell the bags.
4266005	4268287	We need to do the break of songs everybody hates.
4268567	4269307	Okay, you want to do that?
4269367	4269828	We can do that.
4270088	4271189	Okay, forget Blue Impulse then.
4271389	4271929	Let them move.
4274091	4275872	No, except let them move because that song's been banned.
4276913	4277173	Alright.
4277333	4278174	I may be a balloon.
4279455	4280616	I think that song's been banned too.
4280916	4281416	Yeah, banned.
4281756	4283958	So we're going to do a break of songs we hate.
4284558	4284859	Yeah.
4285359	4287200	Okay.
4288241	4289602	You've got to give me a minute to queue these up.
4289662	4290943	Okay, so what song are we starting off with?
4290963	4291503	Sorry.
4291724	4292024	Sorry.
4294190	4295871	I finished the bag of gummy bears.
4296471	4297111	Did you now?
4297611	4298031	It's gone.
4298151	4298751	I gotta get more.
4299132	4299972	How long did that take?
4300012	4300332	A month?
4301212	4301792	Not even.
4301952	4303853	Like a couple, like a week or so.
4305233	4305653	Two weeks.
4305893	4311295	I only have, strangely enough, I only have bag from the non-stop.
4312635	4313736	You know what's really scary?
4313756	4314256	I guess we'll do it.
4314296	4314516	What?
4315196	4317857	They played Junior today on SyFy.
4317877	4318717	Oh, anyway.
4319917	4320857	We'll be back after this.
4320997	4322258	A break of dinner songs we hate.
4322278	4322698	We'll be back.
4401756	4408222	Check one, check one, when I come down, I come down right to the sun.
4408262	4410604	Get right down, get right down to the gym.
4429861	4431943	I'm kicking the boat, don't you know, Bobby Joe?
4432303	4441891	When I come around, I get down, when I get down, I'm down Get right down, I'm down I said one, two, three, four Come on, y'all, I get on the floor Get right down, get right down, I'm down, I'm down
4460151	4461012	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
4482109	4483270	Thank you for watching
4510376	4511477	Blow my whistle, baby.
4511497	4512657	Blow my whistle, baby.
4512677	4514378	Open up and put it in.
4514418	4515079	Let's begin.
4552158	4553140	Let me hear you sing!
4599100	4600170	Slow my whistle baby
4695456	4698662	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move Marathon.
4698942	4699423	No!
4701226	4701887	Just kidding.
4702308	4704973	Orange Lounge Radio, Crap Free Bavani Radio.
4706966	4708227	Bag is a horde song.
4735595	4744143	People play Bagged to Death because it's a ten-footer, and they'll play it on three-speed, and then when they pass it, they're like, oh my gods, I passed a ten-footer.
4744883	4752030	And also, because of the way the song sounds, it's one of those songs you can hear from across the arcade when somebody's playing it.
4755133	4758896	And it's like, oh god, somebody's trying to pass a ten-footer over there.
4759326	4766955	Even real bagpipe music when you're standing next to the pipist, the piper, sorry, does not sound as annoying.
4767615	4776265	I love bagpipe music, not when I'm standing right next to the piper, because then it's deafening, but I would rather go deaf from listening to real bagpipes.
4776590	4777410	Cheng Ma, Love This Feelin'
4804352	4805233	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4824828	4834266	As far as I know, and correct me if I'm wrong on this statement, and I'm sure the chat room will, but I believe it was the first DDR song that had a tempo change.
4835848	4836009	Yes.
4836568	4840452	and now, tempo changes are really horrid in DDR.
4840872	4855346	Like, I was playing Ultramix 2 online today, I was playing some Controller, Controller Revolution, but I, just to cover my ass here, I specifically looked for a room on Ultramix that said Controller Fun, so that we would, you know, be playing with controller people, so I wouldn't, you know, be playing with pad people.
4855886	4855946	Um...
4856867	4858968	DJ Alligator Project, The Whistle Song
4880909	4882669	I hate that song so much.
4882970	4885150	It's, again, it's just horrid.
4885650	4888551	And the song is Blow My Whistle Bitch.
4889211	4892291	And I don't like the fact that they censored it in the actual song.
4892551	4893972	They didn't censor the background.
4894112	4896192	It still says Blow My Whistle Bitch, but they censored the song.
4896412	4899373	Actually, they have both versions on his album.
4899453	4901313	Because I have his album.
4901913	4902353	The vinyl.
4902453	4903514	Oh my god, why?
4905394	4907595	Because I was collecting DDR music.
4907815	4908355	Alright, whatever.
4908675	4909635	I suppose I can let that slide.
4910819	4911899	But that's another one of those songs.
4911920	4923645	You can hear it from across the arcade, and I swear to God, you could be sitting over on, like, Derby Owners Club or something, you can hear, wee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee.
4924425	4926446	It's like, oh God, somebody saw off the machine.
4926786	4927366	You know what?
4927766	4931028	The only thing would be fun to play, like, Bag 2.
4931628	4932729	That's Final Furlong.
4934930	4935950	And then we played Max 300.
4940919	4944321	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4968197	4968558	Nevermind.
4970200	4970561	Alright.
4972924	4981116	As promised, we are going to open up the Skype line for those of you guys that want to give a little bit of feedback on the program.
4981156	4982779	Or maybe you have something you want to share with us.
4983800	4984161	I don't know.
4985309	4988231	www.orangeloungeradio.com
5003898	5006920	Echo123 Echo123 Hey Sky, Siggy here Just woke up, as usual
5033080	5035801	So you must be pretty excited about the 9th style coming out this week.
5036141	5037062	Oh, hell yes.
5037262	5039683	And the early release news, that's pretty exciting.
5040243	5044985	Well, according to PlayAsia, they released it today in Hong Kong.
5045765	5047426	Ah, very interesting.
5047506	5047906	Okay.
5049067	5051528	The release date is March 21st, which is tomorrow.
5052008	5052348	Okay.
5053989	5059431	But before I get into the 9th style business, I just want to say some local news here in Vegas.
5060143	5065926	Sure, we appreciate local news, because we talk about Sacramento way too much on this show, so we need to hear from other communities.
5065986	5066767	So what's up in Vegas?
5067427	5069968	Yeah, um, how should I say it?
5070209	5073831	Circus Circus Adventure Dome's gonna get 2DX Red by tomorrow.
5074591	5076352	Oh my, that's very interesting.
5076492	5080454	Now, I usually stay at Circus Circus when I go to Vegas, because it's fucking cheap.
5081815	5085377	And so I've been to the Adventure Dome, um...
5086135	5091538	God, I think that was one of the first places... Actually, the first place I ever played DDR was Circus Circus, but it wasn't in the Adventure Dome.
5091858	5093279	It was in the arcade they had there.
5093699	5094099	Midway.
5094520	5094780	Yeah.
5095140	5096101	Yeah, yeah, the Midway area.
5097281	5097501	Huh.
5097922	5099362	So they're getting 2DX Red, huh?
5099903	5100103	Yep.
5100443	5101383	In the Adventure Dome.
5101403	5102204	That's so weird to me.
5102724	5104965	What caused them to decide to jump there?
5105065	5106726	Have they been successful with 8-Style, or...?
5107447	5109428	Well, it's probably the locals.
5109848	5111109	The locals have been demanding it.
5111809	5112049	Hmm.
5113010	5113410	Interesting.
5114030	5115011	We'll have to let us know how that goes.
5116107	5117008	Yeah, sure thing.
5117128	5118168	I'll take pictures.
5119609	5121110	Anything else to share with the Vegas scene?
5122111	5123552	Oh, that's only about it.
5123952	5124193	Okay.
5124413	5129796	There's already, you know, some news about getting in the groove here in Vegas.
5130297	5131337	I don't know which arcade.
5132638	5132939	Hmm.
5134340	5138202	Well, you know, with in the groove 2 coming out just around the corner, maybe you guys ought to hold off at this point.
5139483	5139803	Who knows?
5140324	5142645	I'm not an in the groove person, so... Yeah, I know.
5142865	5143346	I know how it is.
5144486	5145167	I feel your pain.
5145814	5147734	But yeah, let's get into Nightstyle.
5147774	5148334	Alright, let's.
5148935	5156376	I'm going to post a link to the website, to a website that has pictures of Nightstyle in it.
5156956	5161417	Ooh, alright, so you can read that in our chat room, www.orangezonesradio.com, click on chat.
5161777	5163157	There's the link, I just saw it pop up.
5164497	5169798	What's interesting about Nightstyle CS is, you know, the main menu is actually mode select.
5172599	5173859	You know, the arcade mode select.
5174215	5177717	Hold on, I'm trying to bring it up myself over here right now.
5178137	5180198	Oh, this is weird because all the pictures are on its side.
5181119	5183280	Yeah, tilt your head.
5183760	5184841	I tilt my monitor here.
5185341	5188583	Alright, so the main select screen is... Mode select.
5188623	5189863	Mode select, that's kind of weird.
5190864	5192625	Here's the actual picture of it.
5194186	5196687	Let me paste it to... Okay.
5197848	5198108	Got it.
5206795	5209008	that's the main screen, huh, when you turn on the game?
5210094	5210476	oh, wow
5211556	5214878	Okay, so the main menu screen has various options on it.
5214978	5216980	Free, training, original, gallery.
5217380	5222023	Kind of what you're used to seeing, but the way it's set up, it almost looks like you're just jumping right into the game.
5222464	5228247	There's really no, you know, fancy... Like, I don't know, like, Sixth Style kind of had its own fancy menu.
5228488	5230229	Wow, that sounds rushed.
5231029	5232711	Well, at least we're getting it.
5232811	5233871	I mean, I can't complain.
5233891	5235012	Well, at least we're getting it.
5235312	5237434	Oh, at least that car has three of its wheels.
5237594	5238094	Shut up.
5240492	5241452	Alright, so that's interesting.
5242193	5242433	Yeah.
5242933	5257239	And on the music list, on the official Nine Style CS website, on the very bottom, it says that number 13, Beyond the Earth, and Sakuretsu, Yega Denko Chop, or Yega Final Attack, are three unlovable songs.
5257259	5258060	You're like me.
5260381	5261901	Okay, that's cool.
5262602	5263742	I was surprised by the number 13.
5263842	5270165	I guess I'd heard the thing, I think you had mentioned it a couple weeks ago, but to see that officially, that was pretty neat.
5272679	5274941	And then I'm interested to hear the new Jaeger.
5275202	5277243	Have the MP3s leaked to the internet yet?
5278104	5278284	Nope.
5278685	5280066	It's only a matter of time, my friend.
5281947	5283669	Probably within this week or next week.
5284062	5284542	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5310856	5317119	I'm quite happy that some songs that made a comeback on Night Style CS, for example, like Empathy.
5318960	5320841	I was a little surprised by the comeback list, too.
5320881	5329385	There were some good things in it, and then there were songs like V, where I'm like, God damn, do we need V again?
5330086	5338210	I'm done with V. I'm over V. I never played a comic concept before.
5338732	5341493	Oh, that's a fun one.
5341573	5345874	Isn't that the one that slows down suddenly and then speeds up?
5346694	5350355	I remember that was one of the first songs I saw on 2DX, was that song.
5350375	5352095	Oh, God, that song is hot.
5352115	5355256	You just wanted to say that so you could pronounce it and show your little...
5365785	5367626	Manatsu no Hana, Manatsu no Yume by Sana
5393817	5401664	I'm sorry, I just... Take it as a compliment, take it as a compliment, that I'm just, I'm doing the blinking thing, I can't understand, I'm sorry.
5402224	5403485	So, alright.
5404766	5407188	Well, are you going to call us next week and let us know what you think about it?
5407929	5409270	Alright, yeah, I'll call you next week.
5409370	5413053	Alright, do that, because we're poor, so we have to live vicariously through other folks.
5413613	5416496	But I'm hoping Jamie will have it soon, and she'll bring it over and let us all play.
5416956	5418998	If I get it, I'll know my birthday's next month.
5421744	5424689	I just said I'm poor, don't be looking at me.
5424769	5425270	I know, I know.
5425971	5426272	Alright.
5426933	5428035	Okay, well thanks for the call, Siggy.
5428055	5428656	I hope you have a good one.
5429116	5429357	Yeah.
5429517	5429777	Alright.
5430218	5430479	Later.
5432165	5433166	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5454847	5457127	You've got to be in our chatroom.
5457547	5458148	And send us $5.
5458788	5459748	No, you don't have to send us $5.
5459968	5460988	Don't listen to Loki.
5461328	5462088	It's all free.
5462108	5465689	You've got to be in our chatroom to vote.
5465949	5466589	That's the way it works.
5466629	5467309	So let's get into it.
5469730	5473030	In last week's cage match, we had a brand new winner.
5473910	5476571	Again, we've had a couple one-week victories lately.
5476671	5479591	Let's see if this one will win for one week or if it'll hold on.
5480291	5482692	It was a remix of an old-school 90s song.
5484190	5485030	What Is Love?
5485351	5486051	by Hataway.
5486131	5486991	It's What Is Love?
5487331	5488112	Reloaded.
5488632	5491073	So, we'll see what you guys think about this one.
5492834	5494535	You did vote it as your winner last week.
5494595	5496816	You may vote it again tonight, or you may not.
5496936	5497676	It's up to you guys.
5498537	5504459	As a reminder, we only play a clip of the first song because you got to hear the song in its entirety last week.
5505119	5508141	And we want to let this segment only take up a little bit of time.
5508181	5510002	It doesn't have to take up all day.
5510422	5510542	So...
5511209	5512650	Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more
5544111	5544693	What is love?
5583857	5593524	I don't know why you're not there I give you my love but you don't care So what is right and what is wrong?
5593864	5597326	Give me a sign What is love?
5597366	5608694	Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more Baby, don't hurt me Don't hurt me no more
5641246	5645649	Alright, song number one, last week's winner, Hadaway, What Is Love.
5646810	5652994	We shall see if it wins again tonight, or if it will bow down to one of our two other entries tonight.
5653094	5654695	Starting off with Loki's pick.
5655336	5657117	And Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?
5658278	5665463	I picked our fellow friend and Kumani artist, MidiHead.
5665603	5670446	He released an exclusive track to us people that bought his albums.
5671461	5674684	And this is for you guys, it's White Knuckle Ride.
5675144	5676405	And, um, enjoy!
5678607	5680609	Song number two, Mini Head, White Knuckle Ride.
5680629	5693240	White Knuckle Ride
5835394	5835979	Thanks for watching!
5927813	5928373	Hi, I'm here.
5928534	5928834	Sorry.
5929815	5932016	We're having a picto chat orgy here in the studio.
5932036	5933858	Had to take a break from it for a minute.
5934378	5938302	Anyway, that was song number two, Midi Head, White Knuckle Ride.
5938982	5939783	What do you guys think?
5941024	5942205	Starting off with DarkSakura.
5942345	5943646	I still hate that man's voice.
5943966	5944266	Sorry.
5944647	5945688	But he's so cool.
5945828	5946448	He's cool.
5946488	5947289	Don't get me wrong.
5947889	5949090	I just don't like his voice.
5949631	5950972	I don't think he can sing very well.
5951693	5954475	So, it would have had a ten.
5955967	5957888	By virtue of voice, it gets an 8 instead.
5958368	5958728	Alright.
5959949	5960829	Who's got a mic over there?
5961809	5962209	Magus.
5966831	5971872	It's not a steaming pile of poo, but... It's alright.
5972193	5972973	Probably gets a 7.
5973213	5975834	It's got a good beat behind it, though.
5978295	5979155	Alright, Angel.
5980555	5980715	Ow.
5981456	5981996	Head rush.
5982116	5982596	Okay, um...
5984458	5988041	8 because I like mini heads and stuff.
5988361	5990582	Yeah, bye.
5990682	5993464	Me personally, I actually thought that song was pretty fucking rad.
5993604	5995225	I think that's one of his better tracks.
5995446	5997127	I kind of want to keep that one for myself.
5997767	5999208	So I give it a 9.5.
6000009	6000309	Loki.
6001089	6002971	Ah, there's a microphone being shoved in my face.
6004051	6007193	Yeah, that's cool.
6007394	6007794	I liked it.
6007874	6008454	That's why I picked it.
6010135	6010796	It gets a 10.
6011716	6012417	Alright, sounds good.
6013854	6015555	Alright, let's get into song number three.
6015676	6018178	Song number three is DarkSakura's pick.
6018238	6019359	What did you pick for us tonight?
6021640	6023482	Um, I like Yoko Kanno.
6023522	6025844	She's really cool and she's a neat person in person.
6026404	6031268	She signed our Macross Plus CD at AX like a while back.
6031969	6034391	Um, anyway, this is one from, uh,
6036006	6039709	She did this on the soundtrack for Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex.
6039829	6040629	It's Rise.
6041270	6045092	I'm trying to remember who sent it to me because I think it's in the chat room right now, but I don't remember, so sorry.
6045973	6046353	Alright.
6047273	6048734	Yoko Kanno, Rise.
6049155	6049495	Enjoy.
6078792	6083056	I'm a soldier, that's it, yeah, yeah, that's it, yeah, yeah
6124107	6124412	Thank you.
6270959	6271539	S, Actdeft,
6381684	6385967	Alright, song number three there, Yoko Kanno, Rise.
6386127	6389969	Did that one rise to the cage match occasion, or did it fall flat on its ass?
6390009	6390750	Let's see, Jamie.
6391130	6393512	Yoko Kanno is awesome, so this one gets a nine and a half.
6394752	6395093	Magus.
6395973	6397834	Pretty nice, I'd say eight.
6398615	6399295	Alright, Angel.
6401657	6401837	Eight.
6403298	6406240	I actually like that a lot, it sounded like it should be in the fifth element.
6406340	6406600	Nine.
6407380	6407701	Loki.
6410643	6411183	It's a seven.
6412765	6416968	Alright, but remember, our votes don't count for shit.
6417048	6419269	It's all up to you guys to pick a wiener.
6420209	6424792	So here you go, three songs for you to pick from.
6425352	6429435	Song number one you can vote for tonight, Hadaway, What Is Love, Reloaded.
6435958	6441922	Song number two you can vote for tonight is Midi Head with White Knuckle Ride.
6449918	6454080	And song number three you can vote for tonight, Yoko Kanno with Rise.
6462423	6465445	I think this is a very hard cage match to decide tonight.
6465465	6469066	I think we got three really good songs in here tonight, so this is going to be an interesting one.
6469766	6471807	Place vote now.
6471907	6475869	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
6476883	6483787	You know, I know the chatroom likes to bitch a lot, that sometimes we give them three crappy songs to pick from, but I seriously don't think you can complain about that tonight.
6484187	6499216	You've got some old school beats there with the What Is Love, you've got some new school, like industrial sounding stuff with a midi head, and then you've got the J, like, I don't want to call it J-pop, but the J-opera rock or something, I don't know, with the Yoko Kanno.
6499256	6502958	So there's definitely something to choose from, from every spectrum there, some good songs.
6503019	6505420	So good luck you guys trying to figure that one out, should be a close one.
6506038	6507362	Send a private message to Sky with your vote.
6508665	6509909	I'm getting some votes in right now.
6511042	6515105	I had a question from AsianBuddyPaul in our chat room.
6515485	6519728	He wants to check in on the Ultracade kicking gallery that we're going to have.
6520348	6522649	Unfortunately, I didn't get a chance to work on that last week.
6522669	6531615	We actually had a photo from one of our other listeners send in a photo of him kicking an Ultracade machine and was wondering where you can send in those pictures.
6532035	6534597	Send those to Rob at OrangeLandRadio.com.
6534617	6536738	I'm going to go ahead and just take charge with setting up the gallery.
6537058	6537959	So go ahead and send those.
6538019	6539640	If you happen to send them to Jamie...
6540100	6543626	or Matt, they will make sure I get them or they'll get them in the gallery themselves.
6543767	6544708	But you can go ahead and send those to me.
6544768	6550738	Rob at OrangeLawnRadio.com In fact, I'm kind of curious if he sent it already because if he did, I want to show it to the folks in the studio.
6551079	6552021	Because I love...
6552865	6554165	Ultracade kicking pictures.
6554505	6561827	And again, please remind Loki or Jamie, I know you're both in on this, why should folks be sending us pictures of them kicking Ultracade machines?
6561947	6569168	Because Ultracade is trying to trademark the MAME name, because MAME already belongs to somebody else.
6570028	6572969	So this person is a big retard, so we have to kick Ultracade machines.
6573129	6573809	There it is, look at that.
6573969	6574829	Lovely kick.
6574849	6575869	That's not even a kick.
6575889	6578290	They are kicking the actual panel there.
6578945	6580646	That owns.
6580786	6583508	That's a you-could-get-busted in the arcade picture right there.
6583608	6586389	So thank you, our buddy Paul there, for sending us that.
6586409	6586990	That's a great pick.
6587570	6591532	Sadly enough, the abuse of these cabinets is going to have to take.
6591753	6596575	We can't actually kick the Altercade components, because, I mean, Altercade is put in these cabinets.
6597056	6599617	The cabinets have no say what games inside of them.
6599757	6601658	Kick the right side where it hits the JAMA harness.
6602379	6604260	Yes, you have to kick the JAMA harness.
6604861	6611027	No, but actually just kick any part of it, because a lot of these cabins are sold with it already in there, so... You know what?
6612228	6613510	They're guilty by association.
6613530	6614931	Think of the cabinets, though.
6615131	6618554	And if you get busted... No, I want the disclaimer here.
6620236	6621818	We did not tell you to do this.
6623139	6625501	I'm not going to get angry letters from your arcade owner.
6625521	6626222	You should...
6629249	6636451	Don't pose like you're kicking the machine, but don't really kick it because we don't want to get your arcade owners upset.
6636751	6639932	And if you do, and if they're mad, we don't know you.
6639952	6640593	And we disown you.
6640613	6641353	You were never here.
6641473	6641933	That's right.
6643934	6644314	All right.
6648615	6655077	Loki, you know I always ask you this around this time of the show, and even if there's no news, I have to ask you anyway.
6655257	6657898	What the hell is going on in the sim scene, my friend?
6659201	6664465	What's going on is this fucking AIM is attached to goddamn Outlook Express, and that makes me angry.
6665186	6666907	Stupid Outlook and MAME.
6667268	6669610	Anyways, our... what our AIM.
6670110	6671471	Anyways, um, SimZine.
6671971	6675114	Um, see, only a couple things are actually going on here.
6675534	6676795	Ooh, Matrix Online launch update.
6677016	6680879	Anyways, um, there is... a couple things.
6680999	6684782	First off, TechnoFiend, they're working on yet another theme.
6685142	6685963	It's, um...
6686519	6688280	I think Techno Fiend Retroactive.
6688340	6691142	It's like a yellow version of Techno Fiend.
6691202	6692983	It kind of looks kind of neat.
6693663	6696825	There's a whole thread on it on Bumicell, and that's supposed to be coming out.
6697245	6699227	Nothing new on Funmix, too, as far as I'm aware.
6699907	6702468	But I'm going to double check, just to be certain on that.
6704209	6709873	Aside from that, also there's the... God, I can't even remember what it's called now.
6711034	6711114	Um...
6712694	6713334	VIRTUAL VISIONS
6731460	6738244	and those are all video game remixes and they're making a step file pack for those and that's still going on right now.
6738685	6740426	And there's a big huge forum now.
6740926	6744589	It's actually a section of their forums that you can actually check out.
6747250	6752233	Other than that, DDR Maniacs is saying they're coming back whenever that is.
6753911	6778401	But that's supposedly gonna happen I mean, not that anyone really cares But MySell's talking about launching version 7 at some point So, and they promised, like, more stuff They remodel their site more than we get new Guitar Freaks arcade mixes Seriously So anyways, that's supposedly happening I checked today to see if there's a new version of Step Mania Guess what?
6778521	6778861	No!
6779802	6781682	How long have we been waiting for Step Mania 4.0?
6781722	6782123	How long?
6783504	6784986	Yeah, okay, that's what I'm saying.
6785266	6786788	No one even cares anymore, I think.
6787208	6788750	Does anyone actually play Setmania?
6789191	6789491	Maybe.
6789791	6790112	I don't know.
6790392	6790612	I did.
6792775	6794997	Other than that, I'm trying to see right now.
6795318	6798381	We're going to go to the FoonMix page to see if there's anything going on there.
6798842	6803226	Because I suspect that there might be, but you know, I need to double check.
6804288	6804388	Um...
6805572	6831424	I was downloading, though, there's, like, you know, you can get a lot of themes and stuff, um, on my, so they have a whole, you know, section and stuff for that, but, um, let's see, Foonmix, Foonmix, Foonmix, here we go, and, what do you know, no news for Foonmix, but it's, uh, Foonmix 2 is still in progress, no date for that, look forward to it coming out, though, pretty soon, I'd imagine, and,
6831829	6832510	Thanks for watching!
6841138	6844199	What was it?
6844219	6846779	DDRXX Mix.
6847519	6856261	And they're talking about a release date for April 1st, I believe, was the release date for that one.
6856621	6863082	And that's supposed to be a big food mix type thing where there's a ton of different things to play.
6863522	6864522	So I think that was the one.
6864702	6866242	There's one of them that's launching April 1st.
6866282	6869883	I don't remember by chance which one that is, but I think it's that one.
6871071	6871852	And that's it.
6872773	6879258	Oh, there's some other people they're releasing, which is kind of neat.
6881780	6887964	There's in the group stuff that's coming out right now, and then there's also sim files for...
6891021	6894465	DJ Max that are being released right now.
6894646	6896167	And the DJ Max songs are pretty cool.
6897008	6906360	For those who don't know, it's an online Beatmania-type game that was made by the creators of Easy to DJ, the other DJ game that's actually pretty good.
6908363	6908723	And that's it.
6911119	6912260	Alright, thank you for that update.
6912280	6914201	That was a lot longer than I was expecting, actually.
6914301	6916963	Usually it's, eh, all the signs are down, nobody cares.
6917503	6920805	So that's nice to know that things are still alive and kicking in the sim scene.
6920825	6923807	You guys want to note to the winner of tonight's cage match?
6924408	6924948	Sure, why not?
6925128	6931392	Now, I thought this would be a very, very close cage match tonight because we had three very good songs.
6931812	6934014	But in the end, one of these songs just...
6935083	6938224	For lack of a better term, it really just blew the other two out of the water.
6939025	6940025	I don't know how else to say it.
6940745	6942666	But this song definitely won tonight.
6942866	6947068	It is... Yoko Kanno with Rise.
6950269	6952170	Getting a pretty large portion of the vote tonight.
6952190	6952891	That's pretty cool.
6952991	6955352	I didn't realize it would be a big gap.
6955492	6956212	I didn't either.
6956732	6958413	I'm kind of sad by that.
6959333	6959733	That's it.
6959853	6960614	It's coming back.
6962274	6963395	You know what I'm talking about.
6965462	6970943	Alright, so there it is, song number three, Yoko Kanno, Enjoy.
6972083	6976824	It'll be back next week, and we'll see how it fares next week.
6978344	6982905	Moving right along, should I do another Skype call now, or should I wait?
6983005	6984525	I don't know if anybody else wants to call in.
6985425	6986246	I guess I'll open it up.
6986286	6986926	I say break.
6987466	6988066	You say break?
6988286	6988546	Yes.
6988726	6989726	Alright, fine, we'll do a break.
6991286	6992307	What are we going to break?
6993407	6994487	I always like to break things.
6996687	6998368	We'll do another call when we get back from this break.
7000090	7005554	In this break, oh, there's a song I really, really want to hear, but it's going to take me a minute to cue it up.
7006574	7008296	So I need somebody to fill time, please.
7012779	7013639	I know how to fill time.
7013680	7016081	Tell us about something stupid.
7016121	7017062	No, no.
7018803	7019684	Tell us about, okay.
7019704	7019784	Okay.
7022788	7024909	I'm so sorry I asked.
7024969	7026010	I will never do that again.
7026170	7028431	I'm gonna fill time, okay?
7028812	7031073	And this is the best filling time I can possibly do.
7031153	7032274	Here, I gotta switch mics here.
7032334	7033454	I need one with a longer cord.
7033934	7034655	Anyways, just a sec.
7035776	7036776	Um, okay.
7039117	7042139	I was just informed of an interesting fact.
7042800	7045601	This fact being, we have a peep left!
7046001	7047342	And what do we do with the peep?
7047923	7050284	Oh yes, it goes in the microwave.
7051368	7051969	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7075856	7078177	Alright, so one of the peeps is going to go in the microwave.
7078757	7087560	You can watch that action on our camera at www.orangeloungeradio.com What the hell has this show come to?
7092662	7094603	Alright, yay, I found the song I wanted to play.
7094923	7096784	Okay, can you see the microwave?
7099005	7100185	Alright, alright.
7100592	7101632	Are you going to do that during the break?
7102152	7103093	I'm doing that right now.
7103113	7103953	Oh, he's doing it right now.
7104353	7105613	And we're pushing the button.
7105633	7109694	Jesus Christ.
7109714	7110194	No peep.
7112614	7114295	You can't even see inside the microwave.
7114335	7114995	It's all blurry.
7116495	7116875	Can you?
7116955	7118576	Oh, I guess it's the screenshot.
7118596	7118956	Oh, God.
7118976	7119856	It's getting big.
7119936	7121036	Oh, yeah.
7126383	7127084	It's getting big.
7127184	7129345	This makes for wonderful radio.
7129445	7130586	It's getting really big.
7131786	7133627	It's, like, very deformed.
7136029	7137210	And I think we're done.
7139491	7142233	I will never ask you people to fill time ever again.
7142293	7143013	Oh, my God!
7143473	7144854	I can see on the webcam.
7144894	7147996	It looks like a big... It looks like our microwave has cancer.
7148056	7148857	That's horrible.
7148877	7149577	Oh, my God.
7150638	7150998	All right.
7152179	7152499	Okay.
7152579	7153880	Anyway, we're going to go to break.
7155100	7156081	And now, Nellie, we'll eat it.
7157362	7158383	We'll be back after this.
7184938	7186240	Turn the table!
7186801	7187582	You get it?
7187963	7189705	Alright, let's practice!
7190947	7192950	First, hit the white keys!
7219454	7219774	Easy, huh?
7219814	7221877	Alright, let's go on to the scratch day.
7241670	7245551	With the fast notes, the technique is to scratch fast.
7245571	7248752	Now it's all the keys and the turntable.
7248832	7252254	It's hard, but you can do it.
7314260	7315281	Remix Remix Remix
7352160	7352666	Remix
7406591	7411453	Solid Snake, Solid Snake, Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?
7411733	7420076	Well, this time the chicken man, it wants your back I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him, oh Don't, what am I gonna do?
7420156	7421357	Don't, what am I gonna do?
7423071	7426514	I've never seen a cool game like this.
7510243	7513507	Easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song.
7514068	7514869	Orange Lounge Radio
7517765	7519465	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7519505	7520606	Hope you enjoyed that break.
7520986	7523066	Emotion was the last song you heard before that.
7523686	7525407	Metal Gear remix there.
7526107	7532688	And starting that set off was Instant Love, also known as the tutorial song from Beatmania, which, who doesn't love that song?
7532748	7533908	DJ Konami is the man.
7534508	7535069	What can I say?
7536229	7538969	Alright, so how did the microwave peep turn out in the end?
7539169	7541770	I noticed the webcam was constantly being updated there during break.
7541810	7543490	I put some random things up on cam as well.
7543910	7544430	How'd that go?
7544751	7546831	I turned it into an OLR logo.
7548926	7550267	You are very strange.
7551448	7552089	All I have to say.
7554011	7558295	Of course, www.orangeonstrater.com Oh my god, it does say OLR.
7560997	7562899	I hope somebody's saving pics tonight.
7563059	7563880	That's all I have to say.
7565161	7568284	We are going to open up the Skype line again real quick.
7568304	7569405	We'll give you guys a little window.
7569465	7570666	I don't know if anybody's trying to get in.
7571486	7573108	But if you guys do want to call in, say hello.
7574085	7577047	www.orangeonstrater.com Click on interact with us.
7577467	7580449	I notice a lot of our regular callers are not here tonight.
7580469	7582430	Like Zaku, he's nowhere to be seen tonight.
7582450	7583531	He's usually the first one in.
7584331	7585252	Nowhere to be seen tonight.
7586512	7590935	If you are a noob and you want to talk to us, now's a good chance to get in.
7592210	7592671	Ronma S, Actdeft
7610987	7611908	I'm doing pretty good.
7611928	7613929	I have another picture for you.
7614489	7617111	Oh, the, uh, the, um, uh, Altercade kicking.
7617872	7619052	Mm-hmm.
7619232	7621254	Could you post the link one more time in the chatroom?
7621294	7624756	I didn't get a chance to look at it because I was busy queuing up that particular break.
7625376	7626417	Sure, no problem.
7626437	7627658	Let me scroll back up here.
7630085	7630605	Here we go.
7631045	7632126	The wonders of the internet.
7632166	7634946	I can actually hear the click, click, click, click.
7635306	7637827	As you're scrolling up there.
7637847	7638187	Yay!
7638487	7640328	I hear Jamie cheering, so it must be a good picture.
7640868	7641648	And there's that one.
7642328	7644249	Oh, I'd seen that one previously.
7644549	7645929	Is that the one you showed me on Thursday?
7646669	7647690	Didn't you show me one on Thursday?
7647750	7648210	I don't remember.
7648230	7650570	I think those were ones from last week.
7650590	7651471	Okay, last week.
7653051	7655932	And we went out... Are those the only two?
7655952	7657192	I thought you had a new one.
7658058	7658579	I do, I do.
7658599	7659860	I'm about to get the link to that right now.
7659900	7660181	Oh, okay.
7660261	7660921	I want that one.
7661022	7661682	Give me the new one.
7662844	7663324	There you go.
7663645	7664406	Yay, okay.
7664906	7665227	Oh, yes.
7666148	7666808	Ooh, it's big.
7667129	7668290	This is a new picture.
7669031	7670553	I'd seen those two previous ones.
7670593	7673536	Again, he's posting these in our chat room at www.wipontryo.com.
7673556	7674498	Oh, a monitor kick.
7678800	7679620	Very nice.
7680280	7683361	What is that guy behind you playing DDR?
7684041	7685822	Oh, I have a little story about that.
7686182	7691784	The guy behind you playing DDR looks like he is in a shower or something.
7692004	7694304	I mean, my God, he's covered in sweat.
7694824	7696245	Doubles heavy.
7696525	7697305	He's a sweaty man.
7697765	7698365	What's up with that?
7699406	7700406	He was playing doubles heavy.
7701458	7704661	I don't see two sets of arrows there.
7704701	7706522	He was playing, but he's not playing it in the picture.
7706702	7706962	Oh, no.
7706982	7707302	There it is.
7727165	7728225	There's the way to do it.
7728425	7735628	I mean, remember that little kid we scared off from a golf line one time because he was making fun of us and didn't I challenge him to a duel or something and he ran away?
7735648	7747131	There was one time where I had these guys hanging around and they were talking all kinds of shit so I said, okay, I'll pay for you to play if you really think that it's that stupid, but I pick the song.
7749472	7749972	Right.
7751303	7752584	I had them thrown out later that night.
7754366	7758749	So after you kicked the Ultra Kade machine, you had to go kick these guys a little bit.
7759530	7764294	Yes, and for the first time in my life, I double A'd all four songs right in front of them.
7765274	7766195	Oh, very nice.
7766275	7770338	It's those moments of pressure when you start doing really well at DDR, huh?
7770859	7771219	Yeah.
7771339	7772000	Very nice.
7772080	7773061	Congratulations, my friend.
7773221	7773481	Thanks.
7774122	7777024	Oh, and, um... And I noticed, I just want to point out the arcade area.
7777344	7782467	The Altercade machine is right next to the DDR machine, which I think is a very interesting setup there.
7782807	7785108	But anyway, I'm sorry, your thought?
7785829	7790691	Yeah, um, if anyone hasn't gotten it yet, the PSP is coming out on Thursday.
7791032	7791672	Best Buy...
7792543	7794945	You can go right to Best Buy and pick it up at 8 o'clock in the morning.
7794965	7795546	No reserves.
7795686	7797148	First come, first serve.
7797328	7801992	If you were a lazy bum and didn't pre-order it like myself, that's probably going to be your only option.
7802032	7804635	And that is exactly what I had to do with the DS, because I'm a lazy bum.
7804815	7810380	Of course, to counter that, you could just pre-order it at GameStop, have somebody call you the day before and pick it up at your convenience.
7811481	7812022	Even better.
7812763	7813083	You could.
7813923	7837189	or you can have a fiance that works at GameStop and bring it home exactly and he could be all bitch bring it home because it's going to be or I ain't putting out I ain't putting out and my Final Fantasy XI Atlas I want to I totally want a Final Fantasy XI Atlas but then again I don't I quit that game I quit that game Rob I quit that game anyway any other thoughts Ranma before I let you go

7860789	7861350	Thank you.
7861910	7862650	You guys rock.
7863130	7863430	All right.
7863450	7863891	Thank you.
7864031	7864891	You rock for calling.
7864931	7865391	Have a good one.
7865792	7866092	You too.
7866292	7866452	Bye.
7867717	7869559	How about a ferret before I pick up the next call?
7869579	7870680	How about a ferret beep for Liz?
7871160	7872361	Well, then I've got to get to the next call.
7873662	7874122	Really quick.
7875183	7875944	Okay, really quick.
7876004	7877065	Then I'm getting to this next call.
7877145	7877806	Ferret for Liz.
7879867	7880148	Hello?
7880868	7881529	Okay.
7881549	7882049	Yes, hi.
7882189	7883430	You are on Orange Lounge Radio.
7883470	7883831	Who this?
7884731	7886233	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
7886513	7887894	Hello, SSJ100 Matt.
7887914	7888855	What is on your mind, my friend?
7889575	7889876	Nothing.
7889896	7896021	I just want to say, I just want to apologize to DarkSakura about the little argument in the chat room earlier.
7896491	7896851	Okay.
7897051	7898632	Okay, apology accepted, thank you.
7899053	7899413	Okay.
7899853	7902295	Okay, aww, aww, I love moments.
7902695	7905377	I love moments here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7906657	7909899	See, I'm nice, I'm nice, I'm not a bad guy.
7910220	7913241	Nobody said you weren't a nice guy, it's just you might have some typing issues.
7913281	7914222	No, I'm kidding, I'm totally kidding.
7915243	7917944	I get criticized for my pronunciation.
7917964	7920246	See, I can't even pronounce pronunciation.
7921086	7924909	Well, when I was four, I glued my fingers together, so, you know.
7925149	7925409	Okay.
7926952	7927452	It happens.
7928212	7928733	Exactly.
7928933	7931954	Any thoughts on 2DX Nightstyle or any of the new stuff coming out?
7933314	7934355	I don't really know what that is.
7934775	7935235	Oh, that's alright.
7935655	7936655	In the Groove, you know that one?
7937376	7942077	Yeah, well, you know, my arcade kind of has it, except they don't, but you know.
7942537	7949680	They've had like the whole box and everything for it, but they still have DDR4th Mix.
7950800	7952721	In the Groove cabinet they have DDR4th Mix?
7952741	7952801	Yes.
7953214	7954915	Yeah, they've had it in there for like about two weeks.
7954955	7956656	Now, that is ironic.
7956716	7962420	When you consider that In the Groove is kind of a stowaway game, and you always see In the Groove and DDR cabinets, that is great.
7962520	7963641	That sounds like an upgrade.
7963881	7966303	That's... It is an upgrade.
7966543	7967524	I agree with you on that.
7969245	7969545	All right.
7970046	7970366	Very nice.
7970446	7971286	I miss 4th Mix.
7971607	7972707	4th Mix was such a wonderful mix.
7973748	7975369	Is it 4th Plus or 4th Mix?
7976330	7976670	4th Plus.
7977070	7978371	Play some conga feeling for me.
7979412	7981113	Because we don't have 4th Plus here anymore.
7982194	7982474	Okay.
7983095	7983855	He's like, no way.
7984356	7984696	No way.
7985236	7985917	All right, try it.
7985937	7987237	Yeah, play some Rhythm and Police.
7988678	7989359	Rhythm and Police is cool.
7989759	7992220	All right, any other thoughts, SSJ, before I let you go?
7993801	7999224	Not really, just a little excited about the anime convention in Arizona that's coming this week.
7999984	8000405	What city?
8001105	8001405	Phoenix.
8002206	8003486	Phoenix, all right, right on.
8004027	8004747	And what's the name of it?
8006670	8008271	and Arizona, Anniezona.
8008592	8008932	Okay.
8009352	8011394	Oh, like Arizona, but Anniezona.
8011574	8011955	I get it.
8011995	8012395	That's cute.
8012455	8012675	Okay.
8013256	8016478	And the guest of honor is Yoshitaka Mano.
8016999	8017359	Okay.
8017739	8018580	I'm going to Arizona.
8020522	8020982	Bye, y'all.
8021463	8021983	Are you really?
8022544	8022684	No.
8023224	8023805	But I would.
8023965	8024545	Oh, my God.
8024585	8025266	He's like my favorite artist.
8025346	8026807	Our webmaster lives in Arizona.
8026847	8028228	I bet you he might be checking that out.
8028529	8031431	Jason has to go talk to my hero for me.
8031591	8033773	Jason's not listening tonight, which is kind of weird.
8033813	8034373	Damn him.
8034634	8034854	I know.
8036267	8039370	I need to meet my artistic hero.
8039510	8040491	Have fun at the convention.
8040531	8043893	If we had money, we would go too, but unfortunately we're poor.
8043913	8047476	Maybe I'll get an autograph for Sakura as a peace offering.
8047496	8049377	That's so nice of you.
8050718	8052880	I just want to give you both a hug.
8052980	8054922	I'll stop provoking you.
8055782	8056583	Have a good one, buddy.
8056603	8057344	Thanks for calling in.
8057364	8058484	That was very big of you.
8058665	8060026	Have a good one.
8060126	8060326	Later.
8063326	8067029	Aw, I'm just feeling, I feel fuzzy wuzzy and I feel sick.
8068310	8068550	Rob?
8068990	8069190	Yes?
8071512	8072312	Alright, that was fun.
8076235	8078216	A lovely Skype segment tonight.
8078496	8079437	Can't complain about that one.
8080846	8083447	I was going to go to a break, but then I realized we just had a break.
8083487	8084127	We can't do that.
8084207	8087488	So we need to take a break from breaks.
8087868	8090808	We need to get into the FUs of the week is what we need to do, dammit.
8090888	8092489	I'm not angry anymore!
8092649	8094289	Which is exactly why we need to do it now.
8100211	8101871	Actually, something did piss me off a lot today.
8102267	8104149	DarkSakura, why do we do this every single week?
8135408	8136449	Oh, this is bad.
8137229	8138890	Here is justice.
8138970	8141111	Here is punishment.
8141171	8143932	Here is... This is fucked up.
8144892	8149334	F you to, uh... Okay, I have to explain this.
8149414	8153696	Everybody knows that I have this thing about old people who drive really, really slow.
8154356	8157138	And then I have this thing about people who talk on their cell phones while they drive.
8158038	8160019	I had the ultimate in piss off today.
8160619	8164541	Because I was stuck behind this old guy talking on his cell phone.
8166219	8173041	He was all veiny and ancient and was leaning over the steering wheel, you know that type?
8173841	8175742	And then talking on his damn cell phone.
8176002	8177382	Veiny and ancient.
8178523	8182524	You know what I mean, when people get really old that you can feel their veins.
8185465	8186925	His wife was in the car with him.
8188946	8190566	They didn't look like they were having a hard time.
8191317	8192978	I don't think anyone was having a heart attack.
8193099	8195781	Billy, how did you get trapped in the phone?
8197242	8200905	Anyway, I just passed him and cut him off and that was good.
8201245	8202566	Did that make you feel better?
8202586	8203267	Yeah, it did.
8203287	8205729	I didn't really cut him off, but yeah.
8205909	8216498	Another FU goes toward our lovely president, fucking asshole, for bringing Senate to vote about that lady in Florida.
8218288	8225254	All right, this is a lady who had been brain dead for 15 years, getting no oxygen to her brain.
8225634	8226655	She was a vegetable.
8226695	8227755	She still is a vegetable.
8227816	8230898	She will not be anything but a living vegetable.
8231518	8234301	And so they got authorization to take the feeding tube out finally.
8234841	8243568	And Senate is, you know, they have other things they could be voting on, like, you know, allotting more money toward, you know, useful things.
8244526	8248669	or, you know, improvement of our social systems.
8249090	8255514	Instead, they're voting on whether or not to let basically a corpse on life support actually be a real corpse.
8256915	8263420	Instead, you know, they're costing this family all of these doctor bills just because of this whole right to die issue.
8263760	8264821	She's not there anymore.
8264961	8266142	Sorry, no one home.
8266622	8267243	Let her go.
8268324	8271066	But, Jamie, we can rebuild them.
8271666	8272867	We have the technology.
8274255	8276456	We could put Walt Disney's brain in there.
8276576	8276677	E.T.
8276697	8277757	phoned home already.
8278698	8286683	What we're left with is to... Actually, she's probably more intelligent than him right now, but... I say... You know what?
8286803	8288464	I say we elect this lady president.
8289004	8289584	She'd do a better job.
8289604	8290725	You know what I'm scared about?
8290805	8292846	The fact that we have living dead.
8292866	8295108	We do.
8295188	8296228	Stop cultivating zombies.
8296268	8297769	And you know she's going to get out of the bed.
8298150	8299670	Brains.
8300151	8300891	Brains.
8300931	8301772	That would be brain dead.
8301832	8303032	She needs brains.
8303473	8303653	With...
8304281	8311284	You see, you see... This woman is starving to death for 14 days, and you're like, BRAIN!
8311364	8313045	Let you guys starve to death!
8313145	8316087	Oh, that's what we need, a brain-dead person starving for brains!
8316487	8319708	Okay, my F you, so fuck you, shut up!
8320489	8322430	Okay?
8322690	8325991	She does not know that she's starving.
8326131	8329473	She doesn't have the capacity to register pain.
8332768	8337451	I think it's going to be one of those...
8357719	8359200	Lethal Injection.
8360340	8360800	Okay?
8361060	8363441	If you're going to kill her, do it quickly.
8363742	8369424	Don't leave her to wither and starve and die away slowly.
8372926	8383310	I honestly, I would prefer Lethal Injection, but if they have to do anything, you know, the only legal recourse they have is to take the tube out and let her die of natural causes.
8384113	8384453	DarkSakura,
8414514	8417096	There is no mind or soul left in her body.
8417476	8418417	It has departed.
8420839	8421339	It's back.
8421399	8422060	There's nothing there.
8422140	8426964	She cannot maintain the cognitive functions of the average human being.
8427004	8427644	I'll put it that way.
8427664	8429546	She has no cognitive functions.
8430867	8431367	End of story.
8432288	8436131	At any rate, I would say that if they could just go ahead and kill her.
8437941	8441206	I would say if they could legally get away with just injecting her and killing her, do it.
8441466	8444291	I would encourage somebody to go sneak into that hospital and do it.
8444391	8444871	No, no, no.
8446346	8450347	This is going to be one of those ironic things where they're going to have this whole battle.
8450387	8453749	It's like that movie, what is it, Citizen Ruth?
8453849	8454649	It's just like that movie.
8454709	8455669	It's a big abortion.
8455929	8457770	Should she or should she not have an abortion?
8458050	8459511	And then at the end, she miscarries.
8459931	8463532	It's going to be one of those types of things where she's going to end up... She's going to wake up.
8463712	8468093	She's going to roll and fall out of her bed and kill herself that way or something.
8468394	8470294	It's going to be one of those really tragic things.
8470334	8472815	After this big, huge fight, something else will happen.
8473735	8474556	That's my prediction.
8474576	8475176	You heard it here first.
8475236	8475636	At any rate...
8477066	8486711	One way or another, her husband should not be made to suffer watching this joke of his wife be kept on life support.
8487031	8487951	There's no reason for it.
8489412	8491213	And I feel really bad for him.
8491473	8494455	And then her family, her parents are holding on to false hopes.
8494475	8497136	She's not waking up.
8497236	8499177	If they truly loved her, they would let her go.
8502426	8503627	Yeah, I agree with that.
8504888	8507790	Okay, let's end on an agreement, please.
8508370	8509951	She needs to die one way or another.
8509971	8511713	Please, let's end on an agreement.
8511733	8514775	She needs to be killed.
8514855	8516056	Any other FUs, Jamie?
8516076	8516556	Break her neck.
8519478	8520939	What rules does this have?
8522920	8524442	I say we give her the log treatment.
8524842	8525482	No, that's bad.
8526243	8526943	No, seriously.
8527304	8528785	My other FUs, I really don't have any.
8529745	8531567	That's just really been sort of my inferiority.
8531667	8532047	Oh, yeah?
8532742	8534483	Um, fuck you to the worm in Silent Hill 3.
8534723	8536485	Ew.
8537085	8537405	And I'm done.
8537945	8538206	Alright.
8538426	8541468	Okay, afterthought, revive Jeffrey Dahmer, have him go at it.
8541808	8543329	Oh my god, you guys are weird.
8543629	8544410	Okay, let's go.
8545270	8547712	Um, let's go to Loki.
8549733	8553596	Just don't acknowledge that with a comment on air, please, I beg you.
8553676	8556117	All I'm saying, all I'm saying is this, where is this at?
8556137	8557238	This is Florida, right?
8558683	8559043	DarkSakura.com
8577393	8582075	100,000 people died in a tsunami in January, and we are all hung up on this chick.
8582155	8585156	Yeah, but did any of them turn into zombies?
8585536	8586416	That's what I want to know.
8586496	8587256	I don't know.
8587917	8595739	At any rate, at any rate, you know, the body, true, it can live without cognitive function, but that doesn't necessarily constitute life.
8597680	8598500	You know what's going to happen?
8598520	8599920	They're going to pull out that goddamn tube.
8599960	8601681	She's going to go, breathe!
8601941	8602941	And it starts there.
8603241	8605622	I seriously cannot take this topic anymore, please.
8606935	8611018	The simple point behind it is just that the Republicans are trying to one-up the Democrats.
8611038	8611518	That's all it is.
8611538	8613440	Okay.
8614861	8615281	Alright.
8616002	8616322	Anyways.
8617472	8619633	So here's my solution to the whole problem.
8619954	8624736	We should have America, because America can make great decisions like choosing the American Idol.
8625116	8627137	We should have them vote on how she dies.
8627577	8635201	Now, this can be anywhere from being shot out of a cannon to dropped from a plane, space shuttle, mirror, I mean, it doesn't really matter.
8635301	8637002	Just, you know, have her die.
8637042	8638263	Because she can't feel pain.
8638523	8640624	I mean, might as well contribute to society.
8640904	8641544	She cannot.
8641564	8642325	She's brain dead.
8644170	8645430	Okay, I'll put it this way.
8645490	8653153	Her nervous system can register a pain response, but her brain does not understand that she is in pain because there's nothing there.
8654373	8658395	How about we poke her and then she goes, ow, then we'll know that she can feel pain.
8659155	8660795	Well, tough, then she's not feeling pain.
8660815	8661476	She's not there.
8662596	8664657	Okay, so that's enough of that.
8665237	8668338	We're going to have a heart attack and then we're going to have to decide how we should kill ourselves.
8669232	8670313	Well, he's already dead.
8670433	8671374	He's not a zombie.
8671814	8677639	Rob, I promise you, if ever you've had some life support with a tube in your stomach, we'll let you go.
8677659	8679100	You pull that fucking tube out.
8679320	8681002	I don't want to be a vegetable.
8681462	8682703	That's right, you pull out.
8682783	8683784	No, I already said this.
8684577	8685377	I decree this.
8685457	8693120	If I am in that state, I want you to fling... I want to be put in a catapult, and I want to be flung against a glass building.
8693220	8694121	Flung at the White House.
8694601	8696422	No, I want to be flung at a glass building.
8696802	8698543	I want to be flung at the Apple building.
8698843	8699103	Oh, cool.
8699123	8699903	During lunch hour.
8700443	8701324	That would be rad.
8701404	8702384	That is my request.
8702444	8702804	Thank you.
8702904	8707326	Can we dress you up in all matching clothes so that you can match your iPod or...
8708889	8716415	One other thing that I do want to mention is that she had actually been witnessing that she would never want to be maintained on life support.
8718877	8719157	Anyway.
8719618	8722800	Seriously, Loki, that comment, oh my god.
8724301	8725122	Only on this show.
8726343	8728085	And we still don't get hate mail.
8728385	8729466	That is the amazing thing.
8729506	8731307	We don't get hate mail over comments like that.
8731528	8732648	I am the voice of the people.
8732869	8733589	What can I say?
8735131	8735591	Anyways.
8736075	8742498	So, further FUs of the week, go to bad drivers, especially people that don't know how to drive in rain.
8742919	8747281	Because when the raindrops are big and there's pea-sized hail coming down, what do you do?
8747321	8748722	You need to drive faster, that's right.
8749162	8754725	So you can slip on the, you know, the water and stuff and hydroplane off a cliff or something.
8755085	8759127	Because that's what people do, and that's what people did today, except they didn't fall off a cliff.
8760528	8762349	Instead, they just got in a car accident and
8763857	8766477	and maybe you turn over a median and stuff like that.
8767018	8767858	Go, people.
8769438	8778520	And also, um, fuck you to, uh, to Necrophiliacs.
8779620	8781800	Please move past it.
8782140	8783400	Please move past it.
8783581	8784841	Even dead people need lovin'.
8785181	8790962	Anyways, uh, um, no, really though, um, am I really here?
8791222	8791942	I think, I think
8792421	8793422	I think I'm probably done.
8793902	8799246	I mean, we know the only thing that... I think she should run for governor.
8801747	8802388	She's got a chance.
8805750	8808111	I'm done, I think.
8808952	8810433	I can't think of anything else funny.
8810693	8811033	You're done.
8812875	8814916	You're done.
8817197	8817558	I don't know.
8817898	8820820	I had some good FUs of the week, but I lost it.
8821020	8821120	Um...
8822754	8823935	F you to disagreements.
8824015	8825196	Can't we all just get along?
8825256	8826156	How about a hug, you guys?
8826456	8827657	I want a big group hug.
8828137	8828918	Big group hug.
8829498	8829978	Come on.
8832380	8833781	It's just me and Angel in the hug.
8833941	8834941	I'm not feeling the hug.
8835442	8836462	Where's the hug, everybody?
8837483	8838263	You guys suck.
8838844	8840505	F you to you guys for not wanting to do a hug.
8842146	8842586	That's it.
8843587	8845108	I don't have anything good to say.
8845348	8846228	I know what we could do.
8846368	8846648	What?
8847289	8850611	We can dress her up and put her in funny situations like Bernie.
8851306	8856210	And it could be like, you know, Weekend with... Weekend with... Terry.
8856370	8857091	Her name is Terry.
8857271	8857631	Terry?
8858031	8859112	Weekend with Terry.
8859433	8861794	You know, Weekend at Terry's or something like that.
8861854	8867959	You know, where she's just sitting there... You are... There is a special place in hell.
8868279	8870321	They already have your name engraved on the seat.
8873243	8873984	I have a seat?
8874284	8875005	Awesome.
8875760	8876261	I'm done.
8876721	8878903	We seriously need to get through this segment.
8879243	8881205	Moving on to other folks in the room.
8883747	8885389	Magus, your FUs of the week.
8887671	8889732	Oh, where to start on my FUs?
8890033	8890353	Oh, wait.
8890373	8891654	I wasn't supposed to bring that up.
8894276	8898600	FU to rude callers, especially at my workplace.
8899061	8899861	I'm here to help.
8900542	8901683	I'm not here to be berated.
8902079	8905381	I'm not here to, hmm, have death threats directed against me.
8905681	8906062	Get this.
8906462	8913467	One fucker decided to actually call in a bomb threat because of Bush's medical policies.
8914067	8915408	Because I work in healthcare.
8916589	8917189	What the hell?
8917770	8919431	You don't leave that kind of shit on my voicemail.
8919451	8920011	Fuck you.
8922413	8926616	Tech support worker is more of my bargain for, but hey, whatever.
8927897	8928777	Ugh, let's see.
8929438	8931239	F you to stupid drivers in the rain.
8933234	8935015	Yeah, I double F you from that.
8935955	8939217	Judging from the amount of cursing from my dad, I think he shares that F you too.
8941057	8941618	That's about it.
8944019	8944359	Angel!
8946019	8946279	Angel!
8947600	8955483	The F you to finals, because I had one operating system after another, because it was like back-to-back finals, and I was like, ah, brain fried, oh my god.
8956424	8957904	But that's over, so whatever.
8958824	8959005	Um...
8962576	8964438	Uh, I don't know.
8965159	8967060	Just, yeah, I don't know.
8967641	8969823	I don't know what else to say after YouTube.
8970003	8971124	Oh, yeah.
8971184	8974867	After YouTube, I'm not playing DDR that much, because last night hurt.
8975127	8975267	Ow.
8979251	8986017	But, uh, yeah, that just means that I need to go to the arcade, like, once a week.
8986898	8987298	If, uh,
8987819	8989901	Some other people in this room would like to do that.
8990121	8991422	So, yeah, that's it.
8991522	8991862	I'm done.
8992062	8992303	Bye.
8993323	8997587	That was a hint with a capital H. I'm just messing with you.
8998067	8998407	Alright.
8999809	9001790	Let's go to the chatroom FUs.
9005393	9006874	Let's start with DarkTetsuya.
9007415	9010337	FU to you guys going to CCL and not telling me.
9010417	9010897	Grr.
9012419	9014400	I will send you a private message later, DarkTetsuya.
9014440	9015261	We're planning on going back.
9016593	9023576	VGM says F you to GameStop and EB Games for not having metal dance pads in Florida.
9024397	9026017	And F you to me for being a noob.
9030119	9037122	Dork says F you to my friend who constantly plays the Ding Dong song for so much that I now made it as a ringtone.
9037602	9040784	And so now I randomly say, oh, you've touched my tra-la-la.
9043593	9051620	AsianBuddy Paul says, F you to wisdom teeth removal, although my consolation is the pain meds that come with them.
9051800	9060988	DJ Ranma S says, F you to that website for firing slash banning me.
9061088	9061828	Fuck you hard.
9061908	9063970	For everything I did, this is the thanks I get.
9064210	9064971	F you royally.
9066937	9070060	Illusion says, F you to suddenly being sick out of nowhere.
9070540	9072602	F you to the alleged song list for Donkey Konga 2.
9073342	9076345	Story of the Year, Good Charlotte, and Taking Back Sunday.
9076705	9079828	Are you trying to make the Donkey Konga players of America retarded?
9080689	9083991	F you to this weekend being absolutely boring, being too sick to go anywhere.
9084332	9087014	Meaning I had to stay at home, sit around, and be completely bored.
9089696	9093980	SSJ100Matt says, F you to my bad grammar and typing.
9094040	9095301	Sorry again, Sakura.
9096505	9104849	FU to the sunburn that I got on my face while watching a spring training baseball game thanks to my sunglasses.
9104889	9105989	I look like a raccoon now.
9108210	9116773	LemonLimeJump says FU to all the tourists in Fort Myers that make the city swell up like a horrible infection just because Edison lived here in the winter eons ago.
9117174	9117694	I forgot.
9117914	9120215	FU to there being no DDR machines in Fort Myers.
9121488	9125009	And lastly, MPQ says, F you to being mistaken for 18.
9125629	9126590	Doesn't do me any good.
9126910	9127810	Would you like to do this?
9127930	9128490	Wait, you're not 18?
9129011	9129551	Go away.
9130231	9136133	F you to myself for crashing into a pole on my bike Thursday and getting a concussion and completely ruining my good day.
9136533	9136953	P.S.
9137514	9138494	F you to celebrities.
9138874	9140274	I don't care about the latest affair.
9140575	9142115	I don't care who's fat or anorexic.
9142215	9143676	I don't care who's married or divorced.
9144056	9145056	Just shut up already.
9146357	9147057	I hear you ain't 18, bitch.
9149130	9149570	That's it.
9150090	9152111	That was all of our FUs that we got anyway.
9153531	9156592	So that's it for the FUs of the week.
9156612	9159472	Thank you guys for being angsty, I suppose.
9159852	9163053	I thought of one late FU I would like to say.
9163613	9167314	FU to Spring Break Shark Attack for being on tonight on CBS.
9167514	9171274	All these sorority girls getting eaten by sharks live on CBS.
9172074	9172935	I hope you have a TiVo.
9174295	9174775	Mike's not on.
9176488	9176968	Awesome!
9177008	9177549	There we go.
9177789	9178329	Much better.
9185092	9186753	Maybe the sharks will... Never mind.
9187233	9188033	I can't even bring it up.
9188093	9188814	I can't even bring it up.
9189494	9191135	Can they eat... Not going there.
9191235	9191835	All right.
9197179	9204205	We could tie her to David Hasselhoff and make it seem like she's running because he'll be behind.
9204445	9206727	Almost like a ventriloquist doll.
9209490	9214834	They could tie her to bars and stuff so they could have someone do a tap dance and she does a tap dance.
9214854	9214935	Hmm.
9218826	9219987	I think we need to go to a break.
9220668	9221388	Oh my gosh.
9222149	9228255	In this break, I want to show some keyboard mania love in this break, because I want to hear some keyboard mania songs.
9229201	9233302	And when we come back, we'll do Ask Orange Lounge.
9233322	9233882	How's that sound?
9234362	9235983	And also the DDR Freak Post of the Week.
9236103	9236783	I want to get into that.
9236803	9238903	But you can start submitting your questions for Ask Orange Lounge as well.
9239804	9240964	So we'll be back after this.
9241224	9242784	We'll do some potpourri.
9242804	9244365	We're going to do a mix of music in this break.
9244505	9246865	Because I really want to play a Mambo A Go-Go song too.
9247426	9251787	So we'll be back after this, starting off with some Klunkang.
9251847	9252687	We'll be back after this.
9446576	9447559	Thanks for watching!
9616236	9621997	Orange Lounge Radio with the Ping Pong Boys.
9623318	9626018	Hello, and we're back, boys and girls.
9626638	9631259	Don't forget, you can send in your questions right now for Ask Orange Lounge because we're going to be getting to that shortly.
9631439	9634420	So we always want to hear the questions that you have.
9634440	9640701	If you want to ask us about Bimani, you want to ask us about Ditter or 2DX or whatever, Keyboard Mania.
9640841	9643422	Hey, I used to be pretty good at Keyboard Mania, little known fact.
9643462	9644382	I used to be pretty good at it.
9644946	9645928	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9661161	9661602	DarkSakura.com
9680862	9682463	DDR Freak, Post of the Week
9710917	9711397	DDR Freak Radio
9738999	9758012	But because it is so damn big, it gets not only all the cool people like you and me and, you know, the rest of the folks here in studio, but it gets the real weirdos, and it gets the noobs, the noobs, then the trolls, and it always gets an interesting post.
9758052	9767778	So this actually was nominated by one of our listeners, Flair One, sent me a private message and said, dude, DDR Freak Post of the Week right here, and I said, dude,
9768476	9768896	You're right.
9769197	9769797	So here it is.
9771519	9777484	This post is titled, Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?
9780006	9781007	Here goes the message.
9782409	9785211	Is it possible to have sex while playing DDR?
9785752	9788174	I mean like not cheating like on the controller.
9788434	9788935	Spelled wrong.
9789195	9790096	But really, is it?
9790816	9793679	I am going to attempt it tonight.
9794580	9796601	I'm going over someone's house.
9797161	9799402	I hope their BF don't get mad.
9800162	9803103	And then wink icon, smile icon, grin icon.
9803603	9805104	Hmm, what else?
9805564	9806284	Yeah, people.
9806765	9809846	Anyone get a AAA on Legend of Max?
9811886	9814487	And that is our DDR Freak Post of the Week.
9815288	9817308	Technically, yes it is possible.
9817789	9821290	If it's sex and it's DDR, chances are Loki knows about it.
9822072	9827455	It would be possible, and this is the only way how, because it would be very difficult to have sex on DDR.
9827855	9833519	You would have to probably be playing Disney Mix, and you'd have to play Mickey Mouse March, because it's all left and right arrows.
9834099	9842824	So, as long as someone is on a countertop that's placed right next to the pad, you could probably be able to step the left and right arrows while thrusting into them.
9843522	9844583	That'd be the only way.
9845323	9846504	Otherwise, it's impossible.
9847184	9852248	I don't know if you understand the joke about this segment, but you're not actually supposed to reply to these posts.
9854289	9863915	Might I say, the post, just as a footnote, the post was promptly locked in the next post by everyone's favorite admin, Spike.
9864910	9871015	So you're going over to someone's house and try to get them to cheat on their boyfriend with you by having sex while playing DDR.
9871075	9872856	Sweet Jesus, what's happening to kids these days.
9873077	9873337	Locke?
9875439	9877000	I'm just saying it's possible.
9877020	9880443	I'm not saying that anyone should try it because that's retarded.
9882364	9883385	DarkSakura, you had a thought.
9885427	9888169	Just hit the pause button, get it done with, then go back and play.
9888189	9893293	There you go.
9898332	9899372	God, I love DDR Freak.
9900573	9902033	What would we do without DDR Freak?
9906695	9909176	I'm so glad the microphone didn't pick up your little comment.
9911977	9913398	No, Magus.
9915479	9915799	Forget it.
9915899	9916499	Alright, here we go.
9923635	9926556	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
9927076	9930276	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
9930776	9934017	We have some noobs tonight who are asking some questions.
9934537	9937957	I just hope they're not as bad as the post on DDR Freak.
9940078	9944259	Why does Orange Lounge have more than, like, why does Orange have like a few syllables in there?
9946959	9950180	Is it possible to have sex while listening to Orange Lounge?
9950960	9952380	Yes, but we highly discourage it.
9953109	9954170	VGM, Dear Orange Lounge Radio
9981334	9983815	Do you guys and girls get paid for doing this?
9984416	9984656	No.
9988978	9989378	I wish.
9989959	9990339	What can I say?
9990619	9993320	No, we don't actually at this time.
9994281	10000544	This is why you might remember at the beginning of the show I announced that Orange Lounge Radio is taking steps to become a business.
10000624	10003386	And myself, Jamie, and Matt, we are all officially a partnership now.
10003486	10009649	So you may see some little ads come to the site in the future, but no panic, please.
10011201	10012305	We hate banner ads.
10012706	10013730	We hate pop-ups.
10015427	10016488	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10046144	10049546	Illusion says, Orange Lounge Radio question.
10050867	10065236	If there were a sequel to be made of any music game, not Bomani, that is US, such as Frequency, Amplitude, or Taiko Drum Master, that doesn't seem like it will have a sequel, which one would you want to see a sequel from?
10066217	10067057	Any thoughts on this?
10068458	10068778	Magus.
10069919	10071560	Guitaroo Man, hands down.
10076265	10081288	I would like to see another sequel to Bust a Move Groove, whatever you want to call it.
10081468	10082588	There was Dance Summit.
10082728	10085289	Yeah, but I'd like to see something break in the U.S.
10085330	10085630	market.
10086370	10088991	A real Bust a Move sequel with all the characters again.
10089231	10093834	Yeah, I mean, I'd like to see another one of those, because that was really the game that got me into DDR in the first place.
10094034	10101897	And I know it's Jamie's pet peeve to call those games Bust a Groove, but when I got into them, that's what I knew them as, so I have to call them Bust a Groove.
10102318	10102498	Yes?
10103258	10103958	I know more...
10106221	10107682	and Puyo Da.
10137502	10143928	It could be versus the RIA this time instead of the drug dealers and stuff.
10146210	10149413	Alright, let's see, moving on.
10150955	10151715	You know what else though?
10151856	10152416	Space Channel 5.
10152937	10153817	I'd love to see another one.
10154358	10155319	Oh god, I love Oolala.
10155639	10161004	Revolution X2 starring the Beastie Boys because they haven't done anything good in a long time.
10161474	10163839	There are, however, music games that don't need a sequel.
10164240	10167246	Mad Maestro, Unison, I can't think of any of those.
10167611	10170712	Alright, I like Technic Peak, you shut your mouth.
10172313	10178875	Laser1234543 asks, can you play some Taku and give a shout out to my site?
10179675	10183896	I hate to break it to you bud, but we actually played not one, but two Taku songs earlier in the show.
10184076	10186537	We did Empathy and I think Karma was the other one.
10187638	10190018	Gotta tune in at 6.30, otherwise you miss them, sorry.
10190879	10194720	Maybe if we have time we'll fit one more in, because I know Jamie will always take any excuse to play Taku.
10195080	10195782	Oh, hell yeah.
10196203	10197607	Story time with Rob.
10198809	10199411	I will get to that.
10201917	10202337	Let's see.
10202617	10205099	Oh, uh, can we give a shout-out to my site?
10205879	10207500	Sure, but you will have to pay for that.
10207840	10208840	Um, no, I'm kidding.
10209000	10209581	Sure, why not?
10210001	10216764	It's laser123454321.com, but he says it's down right now, but I guess it's, um, Stepmania stuff?
10217124	10218025	So, check it out.
10218445	10220446	I'm sure I've been to it, I just can't remember.
10220946	10222747	They all start, you know, running together.
10223267	10224468	Your mind is just a big blur.
10224648	10228329	I need to go look for the Japanese sites again, because I used to have a bunch of them bookmarked.
10228690	10229570	Then they kind of, like,
10230291	10230732	All right.
10230932	10231432	You know what?
10231492	10232253	I'm still wondering myself.
10232853	10237917	The only reason that I got out of it was just that I got way too busy to play.
10237937	10239399	And now I'm on Final Fantasy XI.
10252443	10281871	but you know what's sad is that I have had second thoughts about reactivating my account because I was up to like level 80 something on my Assassin alright you know why because it kind of a lot of the MMOs now are 3D and Ragnarok is 3D to an extent but it still has that 2D feel it has that Secret of Mana feel and I think a lot of folks that are into retro gaming have a special love for it for that reason call me crazy
10282401	10283042	But I think that's it.
10285665	10289670	I don't know if he means like how Burn in the Floor ratings...
10304741	10309045	If you're talking about Step Mania, that's a whole... People can't rate their songs at all there.
10309805	10320334	What was that song I was playing earlier this week that was a 13 on heavy and they had a... Was it an expert or extreme or whatever version that was 20?
10320414	10322776	That was like, this is retarded.
10322796	10323376	What's the point?
10326018	10326599	Gotta love this.
10328761	10331062	Um... Yeah, I don't know.
10331443	10331483	Um...
10333206	10342035	I would say it's because with different mixes, you get different developers slightly each time, so you have different opinions on what songs should be rated.
10342436	10347501	I don't think they have a formula or anything, so that's the best answer I got.
10348542	10349023	SSJ100Mac
10353618	10354699	Thanks for watching!
10377631	10383775	We'll probably still be doing this show out of our apartment, and so we'll have to have a little bit of caution about who's coming in and who's not.
10383795	10385796	Especially, we don't want the paparazzi coming in.
10385836	10387617	We don't want the damn paparazzi in here.
10389178	10392320	Which is really funny, because we could have the paparazzi in here in the near future.
10392680	10397703	Remember back in the day when we used to have all the people that listened to our show come in?
10397983	10399564	They were like, why is our listenership down?
10399584	10400585	Oh, that's right, because everyone's here.
10402533	10403974	No, I don't see why not.
10404034	10405794	I mean, let us know what time frame you'll be here.
10406274	10409876	But in the future, I don't want everybody thinking that they could come.
10411296	10415418	We are going to try and make more public appearances at conventions in the Bay Area and stuff.
10415438	10417638	That's going to be part of our, like, trying to get our name out there stuff.
10417658	10418499	We almost did it this weekend.
10418519	10422260	We were going to do RekkaCon, but I had to back out for other reasons.
10422380	10423700	So, I'm sorry.
10424401	10424641	Anyway.
10426341	10429542	So, yes, you're special since you asked right now.
10429622	10430523	You can visit us.
10430623	10431063	Just us.
10431448	10437972	Send one of us an email, either Rob or Jamie or Matt at OrangeLandradio.com and we will hook you up.
10438012	10440173	It's Loki at OrangeLandradio.com.
10440574	10442695	Matt auto-forwards to Loki anyways, doesn't matter.
10443135	10444296	I get a bunch of spam.
10444536	10447138	A lot of people, a lot of spammers know where my address is.
10447238	10453582	I think you can do DarkSakura and it forwards to Jamie which ends up forwarding to our other address and you can do Rob or Sky and I think it all works.
10455006	10457308	Rob is what's on the business card, so that's why I wanted to tell you that.
10457328	10463254	No one sends me mail, except for the one time when, you know, they sent me mail because I asked for a mail, but no one sends me mail other than spammers.
10463535	10467398	And it looks like Matrix is online today, but, um... Send Loki some email, you guys.
10467599	10469260	Send him some email.
10469741	10471823	Honestly, I need to get rid of spam.
10472023	10473264	I need a new email address.
10474666	10474966	We'll see.
10477180	10484246	Alright, it looks like that's all the questions we got for right now, so I'm going to close up the Ask Orange Lounge segment.
10484447	10485768	So thank you guys for participating there.
10487089	10490612	Angel reminded me to mention something funny that happened yesterday.
10490992	10497118	We were playing DDR, because I mentioned I went to the bowling alley that's open 24 hours, and I was playing some in the groove, and they also have DDR.
10497678	10500360	And I don't know why, if it's just because I'm kind of...
10501461	10502502	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
10518730	10533634	I did it as well, I did Roulette on my extra stage, and remember, extra stage is reverse 1.5 speed, because I secretly don't like doing Legend of Max, because I really can't pass it, because I'm just, I'm old, and it's too fast, and, you know, it's just too much for me.
10533994	10538416	So, call me a sucky DDR player, I don't care, but I can't pass Legend of Max extra stage.
10538896	10540196	It's just too much, too much stamina.
10540736	10543997	So I do 1.5 reverse, and guess what song I end up with?
10544437	10546338	Bag, as my extra stage.
10546969	10551851	and it lands on bag and all I hear is Angelstar going, Ahahaha!
10552411	10553692	Ahahaha!
10553852	10554732	Sucks to be you!
10555472	10557073	I did not, I said no!
10558714	10560214	You were totally pointing and laughing at me.
10560494	10566197	The sad thing is I actually did it and I was kind of doing it for a little while but then I was like, I'm too old and I quit.
10566497	10568618	I don't hold on to the bar or anything.
10568658	10574300	And I'm not saying I'm against bar raping, I'm just, I personally am not a bar holder player type.
10576260	10578462	Next time you consider bar raping, think of the bar.
10580483	10581985	What did the bar do to you, huh?
10582745	10583046	Alright.
10585047	10590171	Anyway, I guess it's that time to start thinking about wrapping up this program.
10590772	10596997	Thank you guys for tuning in tonight, and we hope to see you next week, but we can't end it until we get our final thoughts.
10597838	10599419	Magus, your final thought.
10601581	10604263	Needs more nachos and possibly a little more cowbell.
10606323	10606663	Angel.
10607323	10608924	No more bag on roulette.
10613746	10614767	Nellie, do you have a final thought?
10615967	10618508	Do you really want me to talk about the dead woman again?
10618628	10618908	Sure.
10619168	10619809	No, I'm just kidding.
10620029	10620289	All right.
10620629	10621589	Loki, your final thought.
10623030	10627912	Listen to the podcast where you'll hear more about my dog throwing poop on stuff.
10630673	10633054	And Dark... Oh, my final thought... I'll let you have last.
10633194	10634375	My final thought is...
10636343	10637824	All you motherfuckers are gonna pay!
10638064	10639726	You are the ones who are the ball lickers!
10640786	10641927	DarkSakura, your final thought.
10648852	10649593	Do you know me?
10650193	10651054	I am so famous.
10652855	10654777	Alright, that's gonna do it for tonight's show.
10654817	10657018	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and supporting and listening.
10659420	10661162	Magus, you get tonight's final word.
10661402	10662943	One word to sum it all up.
10665124	10665645	Veggies!
10669685	10672726	And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.
10694051	10695672	We did it all, we did it all, we did it all.
10695692	10702215	Whenever we get our hands on back in the 70s, we did fucking handfuls of mushrooms, pills, lewds, coke, whatever it was, we just fucking swallowed it, okay?
10702235	10702755	That's what we did.
10703275	10704516	People go, well, why don't you go into rehab?
10704536	10706357	We didn't have rehab back in the 70s.
10706937	10711259	Back in the 70s, rehab meant you'd stop doing coke, but you kept smoking pot and drinking for a couple more weeks, you know?
10712179	10713740	Yeah, give me a case of Budweiser and an ounce.
10713760	10715201	I gotta slow down, Jesus Christ.
10715761	10716381	I'm out of control.
10716401	10718222	Look at the size of my pants, for Christ's sake.
10723203	10724124	That's the big thing now.
10724164	10726346	Rehab is the big fucking secret now, isn't it, huh?
10726706	10728868	Yeah, you can do whatever you want, just go into rehab and solve your problems.
10728888	10729829	Isn't that the big celebrity thing?
10729849	10730810	That's what I'm going to do.
10731451	10732271	Yeah, I'm going to get famous.
10732752	10736555	Then when my career starts to flag, I'm going to go on a three-month fucking bender, okay?
10736895	10744382	Coke and fucking pot and smack and fucking booze and drive over people and beat up my kids, go into therapy, go into rehab, come out of rehab, be on the cover of People magazine.
10744602	10745003	Sorry!
10747565	10748306	I fucked up!
10750805	10755268	That's what they do, man, they go in a rehab and they come out and they blame everybody except themselves They blame their parents, right?
10755508	10758029	That's the way everybody comes from a dysfunctional family all of a sudden, huh?
10758509	10760450	Roseanne Barr comes from a dysfunctional family?
10760490	10766114	Not Roseanne, she seems so normal to me The Jacksons were dysfunctional?
10766154	10777280	Not the Jacksons These people give each other new heads for Christmas, for Christ's sake I am sick and tired of hearing that fucking speech, you know?
10778382	10780363	These people come out of rehab and they always have the same story.
10780383	10784445	Well, you know, I became an alcoholic because my parents didn't love me enough.
10785245	10787766	And then I became a junkie because my parents didn't love me enough.
10788167	10791608	And I went into hypnosis and therapy and I found out that my parents used to hit me.
10791628	10794750	Hey, my parents used to beat the living shit out of me, okay?
10795170	10796771	And looking back on it, I'm glad they did.
10796791	10799512	And I'm looking forward to beating the shit out of my kids, aren't you?
10802992	10804613	for no reason whatsoever.
10804633	10805733	What'd you hit me for?
10805773	10807874	Shut up and get out there and mow the lawn, for Christ's sake.
10808454	10813995	There's therapy for you, mowing the lawn and crying at the same time.
10814356	10815656	Delirious kids in therapy again.
10815676	10816496	Their lawn looks great.
10816536	10817337	It's unbelievable.
10820638	10821218	God.
10821978	10822918	I'm just not happy.
10823518	10824519	I'm just not happy.
10825559	10828780	I'm just not happy because my life didn't turn out the way I thought it would.
10828800	10831261	Hey, join the fucking club, okay?
10832210	10836994	I thought I was going to be the starting center fielder for the Boston Red Sox Life sucks, get a fucking helmet, alright?
10841818	10844621	I'm not happy, I'm not happy Nobody's happy, okay?
10844641	10850046	Happiness comes in small doses, folks It's a cigarette or a chocolate chip cookie or a five second orgasm That's it, okay?
10850266	10854349	You come, you eat the cookie, you smoke the butt You go to sleep, you get up in the morning and go to fucking work, okay?
10855090	10857092	That is it, end of fucking list
10860177	10861197	I'm just not happy.
10861277	10862938	Shut the fuck up, all right?
10863778	10867399	That's the name of my new book, Shut the Fuck Up by Dr. Dennis Larry.
10868499	10870479	A revolutionary new form of therapy.
10870499	10873400	I'm going to have my patients come in, doctor, I say, shut the fuck up next.
10874620	10876761	I don't feel so, shut the fuck up next.
10877841	10879741	He made me feel so much better about myself, you know?
10880141	10882722	He just told me to shut the fuck up and nobody ever told me that before.
10882782	10883662	I feel so much better now.
10885883	10887283	Whining fucking maggots.
10890345	10891106	and all these people quitting.
10891126	10896150	Look, I think it's a good thing, AA, and the recovery and rehab, because I've got some friends who would be dead without those programs, but you know something?
10896170	10901995	Now we have a different problem, because now they quit drinking and drugs, they're completely stressed out, and they decide to work out, which is fine.
10902336	10904458	I'm not a workout guy, but I understood Nautilus.
10904498	10909582	It made sense that we're arm machines and leg machines, but have you seen these people who are using the Stairmaster?
10910163	10912525	Have we turned into gerbils, ladies and gentlemen?
10913129	10917451	People are paying money to go into a health club and walk up invisible steps over and over again for an hour and a half.
10917671	10918171	Where are you going?
10918411	10919051	I'm going up!
10919371	10920392	And I paid for it, too.
10920432	10921872	I can stay here as long as I want, folks.
10922053	10925194	You want to go up and downstairs, move into a fifth floor, walk up on the Lower East Side, okay?
10926114	10926614	What's next?
10926694	10927735	A fucking chair master?
10927775	10929735	I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up, I sit down, I get up.
10929976	10933417	The door master, I open the door, I go... What the fuck?
10937719	10941180	Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.
10968874	10970395	Sorry, I fucked up!
