Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 21st, 2005.

00:06.000 --> 00:16.000
And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.

00:16.000 --> 00:22.000
And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Skye, and Loki.

00:22.000 --> 00:27.000
Hello everybody out there in podcast-subscribing land.

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Thank you very much for deciding to check us out.

00:30.000 --> 00:31.000
We appreciate it.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.000
Here we are, the Orange Launch Radio podcast,

00:34.000 --> 00:38.000
dedicated to what gamers really want to know out there on the internet.

00:38.000 --> 00:40.000
All right, my name is Skye, Rob Roberts.

00:40.000 --> 00:41.000
Join me as always.

00:41.000 --> 00:44.000
Say hello to DarkSakra, Jamie.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.000
Yo, what up, my homies?

00:46.000 --> 00:50.000
All right, and also say hello to Loki, Matt.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Hey, what's up?

00:51.000 --> 00:54.420
Not a whole lot. Uh, let's

00:54.420 --> 00:59.320
go and talk about what games we've been playing this week and kinda what's new

00:59.320 --> 01:00.360
in our gaming world.

01:00.360 --> 01:03.440
Uh, DarkSakura, what have you been up to playing? What have you been up to?

01:03.440 --> 01:08.400
Silent Hill 3, all day. I've actually been cheating.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.640
What part of Silent Hill have you been in? I'm still in the beginning, Silent Hill 3.

01:11.640 --> 01:14.800
Does this have anything to do with the recent thunderstorms we've been having in

01:14.800 --> 01:15.680
the area here in

01:15.680 --> 01:18.840
Sacramento where we face our problems? We call that a storm. I know, but you know,

01:18.840 --> 01:23.840
for this area it's pretty big storm whether we actually know it was

01:23.840 --> 01:27.400
and really nothing to do with that it's just we were playing with the

01:27.400 --> 01:31.800
trying to see if we were gonna seller pro-action replay and we did a bunch

01:31.800 --> 01:34.280
codes that I was playing on the hill for with the header beam

01:34.280 --> 01:39.440
as you with the sexy beam and with her magical transformation

01:39.440 --> 01:43.960
into super magical girl Heather you get this one

01:43.960 --> 01:48.200
and when you equip it you get a transformation sequence on top of that

01:48.200 --> 01:52.080
Alright. It's funny. I haven't played...

01:52.080 --> 01:56.880
Silent Hill 3 is like, I played a lot of Silent Hill 2 and I played a lot of Silent Hill 4.

01:56.880 --> 02:00.560
I somehow completely skipped over 3. I don't know how that happened, so...

02:00.560 --> 02:03.960
I need to give you back your 4, I found it. Yes you do!

02:03.960 --> 02:07.600
I'll give it back. It's all good. I don't mind. I know it's in good hands.

02:07.600 --> 02:10.920
Alright, is that it? Just Silent Hill 3? Some

02:10.920 --> 02:14.960
Final Fantasy 11, though hardly any. Do you know, you know one of my buddies was talking

02:14.960 --> 02:15.840
about that

02:15.840 --> 02:19.440
He was actually over, of all people, Rice Princess and Lanky Stop from the Thursday

02:19.440 --> 02:24.160
Night Show here on Orange Launch, he was over their house and they were playing Silent Hill

02:24.160 --> 02:28.920
and Siren and all these scary games last night in the thunderstorm while it was thundering

02:28.920 --> 02:29.920
outside.

02:29.920 --> 02:30.920
Do you ever do that with scary games?

02:30.920 --> 02:31.920
No.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.920
Oh.

02:32.920 --> 02:33.920
I don't know.

02:33.920 --> 02:34.920
I just thought I'd ask.

02:34.920 --> 02:35.920
I usually sleep when it starts raining.

02:35.920 --> 02:38.920
There's two things that are guaranteed to put me to sleep.

02:38.920 --> 02:46.120
is being a passenger in a car and the other is rain especially rain on metal

02:46.120 --> 02:52.540
so when it rains when I'm in a car it's an instant coma hmm but rain thunder

02:52.540 --> 02:56.680
rain makes me it puts me to sleep I can't sleep in the Thunder I grew up I

02:56.680 --> 03:00.520
wake up I wake up too quick all right Loki would even up to what even playing

03:00.520 --> 03:05.840
this week I've been playing actually some act different games other than

03:05.840 --> 03:14.240
Final Fantasy XI, I picked up Gran Turismo 4 and a game called Dog's Life.

03:14.240 --> 03:15.240
What is Dog's Life?

03:15.240 --> 03:17.680
Now this is different than Nintendogs, which we've talked about breezily.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.680
Yes.

03:18.680 --> 03:19.680
What's Dog's Life?

03:19.680 --> 03:23.840
Dog's Life is basically this game where you play a dog, and you run around and do what

03:23.840 --> 03:33.480
dogs do, like sniff smells and, you know, crap, and you actually run around, it's basically

03:33.480 --> 03:36.480
Wait, so there's actually a button to crap?

03:36.480 --> 03:39.480
Actually, it's a trick you have to learn.

03:39.480 --> 03:41.480
To crap and fart.

03:41.480 --> 03:43.480
And it's great about the game.

03:43.480 --> 03:45.480
It's like learning how to throw a fireball in Street Fighter II.

03:45.480 --> 03:48.480
Just down towards punch.

03:48.480 --> 03:49.480
Something like that.

03:49.480 --> 03:53.480
But, um, you know, this game, um, it's very interesting.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.480
It's more kind of a collection game.

03:55.480 --> 03:57.480
It's really kind of meant for, like, little kids.

03:57.480 --> 03:59.480
But what's weird, though, is even though it's meant for little kids,

03:59.480 --> 04:02.480
there's, like, a lot of this really crude humor that's in it.

04:02.480 --> 04:08.400
It's a little odd, but the plot line is kind of seems like it's ripped from 101 Dalmatians

04:08.400 --> 04:14.320
that a dog's been kidnapped by some woman named Mrs. Peach that makes dog food or something.

04:14.320 --> 04:16.540
I don't know what exactly that's about.

04:16.540 --> 04:21.820
But anyways, so she's kidnapping the dog and I haven't even really gotten that.

04:21.820 --> 04:27.120
All I've been doing is running around in smell-o-vision, which you can actually see the smells, which

04:27.120 --> 04:28.120
is kind of neat.

04:28.120 --> 04:32.040
collect smells or whatever and then you get a bone or whatever and then or you

04:32.040 --> 04:36.220
can you know collect smells and race a dog and you get to be come this small

04:36.220 --> 04:39.880
little dog run around and it's just interesting but one of the things I've

04:39.880 --> 04:45.080
been passing my time with this shitting grabbing my shit and then flinging it at

04:45.080 --> 04:51.720
people that's quite fun right like for example I'm I jumped on top of a van and

04:51.720 --> 04:56.160
took a crap and then just ran away and then like yeah this is like small stuff

04:56.160 --> 05:02.300
like that. You know, taking this out of context, like if we were to clip up the audio of this,

05:02.300 --> 05:08.940
and so you wouldn't know he was talking about a dog video game, that'd be quite hilarious.

05:08.940 --> 05:13.560
Very incriminating. We'll have to save it for promo. That's a good idea. Alright, how's

05:13.560 --> 05:17.600
Gran Turismo? I'm curious about that one. Gran Turismo I played for about five minutes,

05:17.600 --> 05:20.800
just I played a couple of the arcade stuff, because I've been kind of mainly playing this

05:20.800 --> 05:25.440
dog game. But anyways, Gran Turismo, he's more into crapping on vans than driving them.

05:25.440 --> 05:30.440
Okay, so I was playing Gran Turismo, and I had to remind myself why I sucked at Gran Turismo.

05:30.440 --> 05:33.440
It's mainly because I can't steer for shit in the game.

05:33.440 --> 05:39.440
But anyways, you start it up and it starts playing this really opera sounding music, and it's beautiful.

05:39.440 --> 05:46.440
I mean, the graphics are really good, except the background and the audience, they're still 2D.

05:46.440 --> 05:48.440
They're still flat and not moving.

05:48.440 --> 05:54.440
Yet the game boasts on the back that the audience reacts to what you do.

05:54.440 --> 05:59.600
And the only guys that are like a, oooh, ahh, type of thing, or?

05:59.600 --> 06:02.200
I saw camera flashes and that's about it.

06:02.200 --> 06:07.740
I didn't see the audience moving, they're just kind of looking like Jerry Blank's dad

06:07.740 --> 06:09.240
in Strangers with Candy.

06:09.240 --> 06:12.240
That's a reference nobody's gonna get, that's what I feel.

06:12.240 --> 06:14.400
That's why they have to watch the movie when it comes out.

06:14.400 --> 06:15.400
Alright.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.620
But, so that's what happened there.

06:17.620 --> 06:22.000
But it was really good, the second race I did was on an off-road course, and I have

06:22.000 --> 06:26.700
to mention beforehand, they recreated all the tracks from the first game, in this game.

06:26.700 --> 06:32.720
So that's really cool, first off. And there's like, I forget, 100 tracks, 600 cars. You

06:32.720 --> 06:37.240
start off with 240, so that's like a ton to unlock. And there's a ton of cars there. The

06:37.240 --> 06:42.640
first car I played as was a Ford Focus, because that's what I drive, so I decided to see how

06:42.640 --> 06:48.300
well of a race car that is, and it's not. And then I tried playing like sort of a rally

06:48.300 --> 06:54.680
type car thing, I did some off-road driving, versus this like Subaru Impreza or whatever

06:54.680 --> 06:59.800
it is, I'm probably all fucking that up because I don't know cars at all, a newer looking

06:59.800 --> 07:07.120
car versus a boat basically, just like this old ass car that I was driving, giant boat,

07:07.120 --> 07:12.160
and of course the other car's kicking my ass because the boat does not go fast. The boat

07:12.160 --> 07:20.200
floats, like a boat would. But, um, it was interesting. So, um, but I like it. I gotta,

07:20.200 --> 07:24.040
you know, get into playing it more, and if I get frustrated, it'll cheat.

07:24.040 --> 07:27.080
Alright, sounds good. I'm looking forward to hearing more about what you think about

07:27.080 --> 07:32.280
that game in the future. Uh, myself, I, I'm still on the same game as I was last week.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.640
I've been playing Phantasy Star online in Zelda Minish Cap. I've been making a little

07:35.640 --> 07:40.200
bit of progress in both. I now have two characters at level 10 in Phantasy Star, thank you very

07:40.200 --> 07:44.600
much. Um, you know, I've just been having fun playing with friends on there. I have

07:44.600 --> 07:49.020
yet to really find other opponents on Xbox Live, but I think I'm just going into the

07:49.020 --> 07:53.520
wrong blocks. Like, I'm going into the first ship, first block, and there's a lot of people

07:53.520 --> 07:57.300
in there that just talk crap to each other in there. It's just, man, I wish I could play

07:57.300 --> 08:00.080
for you. For those of you guys that don't have Xbox Live, I wish I could play for you

08:00.080 --> 08:04.760
the stuff people say in these lobbies. It's insane. But anyway, uh, pretty much just been

08:04.760 --> 08:08.140
playing those same games. Haven't had a whole lot of time to play any new stuff. Besides

08:08.140 --> 08:11.880
fact I went to the arcade and I played, you know, some In the Groove, which is that new

08:11.880 --> 08:16.660
dance game that's kind of trying to take DDR's throne. We'll see, who knows what happens

08:16.660 --> 08:21.540
to that. All right, let's get into some gaming news. Of course, what is on everybody's mind

08:21.540 --> 08:26.420
this week is the PSP is coming out. I know I'm too broke to get one.

08:26.420 --> 08:32.420
Bah humbug. Why do you say bah humbug? Just to be contrary, I'm actually getting one.

08:32.420 --> 08:36.740
See, yeah, you're the lucky one that can actually get one of these. I unfortunately am too poor

08:36.740 --> 08:42.020
to go in right now somebody should send me a free one I'd like that idea you

08:42.020 --> 08:49.380
know somebody should nice to one all right if you want to get your hands on a

08:49.380 --> 08:53.380
PSP if you want to be one of the first well you have to live in San Francisco

08:53.380 --> 08:59.140
because actually at the Sony metreon they're gonna have a midnight sale 1201

08:59.140 --> 09:03.060
a.m. on the dot Thursday here's the other part of that for those of you guys

09:03.060 --> 09:07.740
that are too lazy to pre-order, reserve, that kind of stuff, the Metreon is going

09:07.740 --> 09:12.500
to sell them on a first-come, first-serve basis. So it'll be interesting to see what

09:12.500 --> 09:16.580
kind of people end up camping out this week. There's also Best Buy's doing the exact

09:16.580 --> 09:22.500
same thing as far as... But not the 1201 thing. So if you have, if you're one of

09:22.500 --> 09:28.020
those people, you have to be the first to own it. More power to you. Get your ass on

09:28.020 --> 09:31.900
down to the Metreon and do that. Well they definitely giving you more, you know,

09:31.900 --> 09:36.100
more to look forward to, you know, getting it first day because there's actually games

09:36.100 --> 09:39.980
out for it, whereas the DS, we're still waiting for games to come out for it.

09:39.980 --> 09:43.660
Speaking of which, this was another news story I wanted to mention about.

09:43.660 --> 09:48.900
The official launch of the PSP isn't happening until Thursday, but retailers are already

09:48.900 --> 09:50.940
selling the software.

09:50.940 --> 09:55.580
Here's the thing, there's a restriction on the street date for the PSP, but there's no

09:55.580 --> 09:59.820
rules against distributing the software before the hardware street date.

09:59.820 --> 10:05.020
are out there and they are buying the games before the PSP. They're at Fry's, I

10:05.020 --> 10:09.300
was there. They had Wipeout, they had Metal Gear, they were there. And for those

10:09.300 --> 10:13.020
who don't know, Fry's is a major chain on the west coast here. Fry's Electronics. Yeah,

10:13.020 --> 10:18.540
a lot of places I'm hearing you're getting the games, so I don't understand

10:18.540 --> 10:22.260
why you would want to buy the game when you don't have the system. Maybe you want

10:22.260 --> 10:26.740
to oogle over the instruction manual, or you just want to hold the disc in your

10:26.740 --> 10:30.920
your hands and confirm that it's not going to play in a normal CD player I

10:30.920 --> 10:35.360
don't know why. It's a smart way to build the hype though to go ahead and start

10:35.360 --> 10:39.040
making some money on it. I guess have the display boxes out there. Although I did

10:39.040 --> 10:42.560
think they should have done what like how they did with the Dreamcast what

10:42.560 --> 10:46.660
Blockbuster did. Blockbuster had a deal where you could rent Japanese Dreamcasts

10:46.660 --> 10:51.320
and play Sonic Adventure. Oh wow. And then you know of course they had to send them all

10:51.320 --> 10:55.520
back but you could actually rent just those two. They should do something like

10:55.520 --> 11:00.280
that with the PSP I thought you know that would be a way to let people see

11:00.280 --> 11:03.800
what it was like well they have the kiosks and stores now right cuz I've

11:03.800 --> 11:10.360
heard you can yeah I've heard some folks have played the PSP hands-on demo units

11:10.360 --> 11:16.320
for the staff oh interesting well the PSP is coming out this week I'm sure

11:16.320 --> 11:19.960
there'll be plenty of news all over the internet about it we're just kind of you

11:19.960 --> 11:22.640
know waiting to get our hands on one and we'll definitely give you our feedback

11:22.640 --> 11:27.440
We will all have to share Jamie's PSP if she's willing to share next week.

11:27.440 --> 11:33.640
You know, that's actually Dan's PSP. Aww. But I'm gonna bring him next week. Okay, yeah, steal it from Dan.

11:33.640 --> 11:36.560
Whenever we have it, I'll bring him. Dan can live without it for 30 minutes while

11:36.560 --> 11:41.960
we tape this podcast. All right, reminder guys, if you ever have any feedback on

11:41.960 --> 11:44.660
the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition, you can send us an email. The email

11:44.660 --> 11:51.680
address is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com. Since we talked about the PSP,

11:51.680 --> 11:56.820
let's talk about the competitor the DS. DS just rolled out recently in the UK

11:56.820 --> 12:00.980
although okay you know what though it's weird for me to call the DS the PSP

12:00.980 --> 12:06.200
competitor I know that a lot of folks want to say DS PSP DS it's like a big

12:06.200 --> 12:09.720
fight but honestly to me and that's the way I felt about the two systems at

12:09.720 --> 12:14.760
first especially at e3 but to me now both systems really are incredibly

12:14.760 --> 12:18.520
different and they really both have different things to offer such as the

12:18.520 --> 12:24.960
PSP actually has games on launch date. DS has, you know, the innovation touch screen

12:24.960 --> 12:29.280
and all that other stuff. So, it's hard for me to compare the two. I don't know. Jamie,

12:29.280 --> 12:33.680
is there a comparison for you or is it just... Not really. Yeah. You know, there's a difference

12:33.680 --> 12:39.400
between your DS and the great game launcher. I wonder if you can still shoot games out.

12:39.400 --> 12:42.080
You have to twist it pretty hard though. That's what I'm curious about, if the PSP is still

12:42.080 --> 12:45.920
going to be a great game launcher. Remind us again about what was going on in Japan?

12:45.920 --> 12:50.480
I had a fail-safe built in so that you wouldn't hurt the games or something, something or

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
the other.

12:51.480 --> 12:56.200
That if you got too aggressive with the system and twisted it, you know sometimes, you know

12:56.200 --> 12:58.960
I used to do it all the time with old Game Gear and everything.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.760
With the Nomad, sometimes you get so into the game that you twist it just a bit like

13:01.760 --> 13:04.400
if you're doing a racing game or something.

13:04.400 --> 13:10.440
But if you twist it in that manner, it would shoot the game out.

13:10.440 --> 13:13.200
You'll shoot somebody's eye out with that thing.

13:13.200 --> 13:15.680
Alright sorry, I just wanted to get that out there.

13:15.680 --> 13:20.360
let's get to the DS story it actually just launched in the UK recently and it

13:20.360 --> 13:26.800
sold 87,000 units in the first two days that makes the DS the biggest hardware

13:26.800 --> 13:32.040
launch in the UK to date they are calling this over a Nintendo the general

13:32.040 --> 13:37.400
manager of Nintendo UK David yarn 10 says an unprecedented success breaking

13:37.400 --> 13:42.800
all expected sales figures and even exceeding our expectations good news for

13:42.800 --> 13:47.280
the Nintendo folks in the UK now if we can just get some damn games where's my

13:47.280 --> 13:54.960
Animal Crossing where's my Castlevania give it to me now all right also in DS

13:54.960 --> 14:00.960
news this was a really big thing that was going around this week apparently if

14:00.960 --> 14:06.720
you look in the recent issue of Nintendo power it's what I'm hearing under Namco

14:06.720 --> 14:14.280
planned DS titles you can actually see Katamari Damacy DS is being planned

14:14.280 --> 14:19.080
that is so cool to me now I'm kind of wondering how you gonna control this but

14:19.080 --> 14:22.720
you have any thoughts on this Jamie I know you're a big Katamari Damacy fan

14:22.720 --> 14:29.560
um like that pac-man marble madness game that they had at e3 trackball okay do a

14:29.560 --> 14:32.560
trackball style with the stylus interesting thoughts like a little track

14:32.560 --> 14:34.560
Okay, alright. Loki?

14:34.560 --> 14:37.560
That was my thought too, as well.

14:37.560 --> 14:46.560
You're that or you'd use like the directional pad as like one analog and the four buttons on the other side as the other analog, sort of.

14:46.560 --> 14:52.560
I was kind of wondering how the whole two screen thing is going to work in Katamari to Mashidias.

14:52.560 --> 14:58.560
Like is the top screen strictly for the King's package or how's that going to work? That's what I want to know.

14:58.560 --> 15:02.600
probably be just you know stretched out maybe a map on the bottom or something

15:02.600 --> 15:06.000
that's typical for DS games have your little map on the bottom but then again

15:06.000 --> 15:09.240
katamari namashi you know I kind of would have liked a nicer map in that

15:09.240 --> 15:12.520
game so it would be kind of neat though that if you were they're using the

15:12.520 --> 15:15.920
buttons and everything on the normal screen and then on the lower screen as

15:15.920 --> 15:20.600
your bog is bigger you know how your field of vision gets bigger your map

15:20.600 --> 15:26.520
expands okay and scroll out some good ideas there so we'll see what the future

15:26.520 --> 15:30.720
brings for Katamari to mashi ds very excited about that very happy about that

15:30.720 --> 15:37.800
all right um let's see also in ds news i have one of the story about the ds just

15:37.800 --> 15:42.000
a quick one majesco is announced that they're going to bring two new ds games

15:42.000 --> 15:47.540
out later this year one of them being atv quad frenzy and that's you know four

15:47.540 --> 15:52.200
wheel in action on your ds 40 different tracks and you can upgrade your ride

15:52.200 --> 15:57.080
using the stylus and it's got Wi-Fi support but the other game is Texas

15:57.080 --> 16:03.280
Hold'em poker and I'm just kind of going do we need another poker game to quote

16:03.280 --> 16:10.240
the best line ever from Mr. Science Theater 3000 the movie well whoopty shit

16:10.240 --> 16:15.880
what is with the popularity of all these poker games because I I keep seeing all

16:15.880 --> 16:21.080
these cheap Gameboy and PlayStation poker games for sale at Walmart is it

16:21.080 --> 16:25.240
just because of the show it's not just that it's I went to when I was at fries

16:25.240 --> 16:29.640
last night oh yeah last night they had they were selling poker tables poker

16:29.640 --> 16:34.680
sets just everything is it seriously the popularity that celebrity poker or what

16:34.680 --> 16:41.800
like poker is the new bejeweled it's funny you should bring up bejeweled I

16:41.800 --> 16:45.460
want to mention this this is a little bit off from the stuff we usually talk

16:45.460 --> 16:50.240
about but this is something interesting that's going on in North Carolina in

16:50.240 --> 16:56.600
In North Carolina, they are actually considering, some state lawmakers are considering banning

16:56.600 --> 17:02.080
Solitaire from computers, and Minesweeper as well, they are going to, and I'm not saying

17:02.080 --> 17:06.320
from every computer, you can do what you want in your house, but from state computers and

17:06.320 --> 17:12.200
state offices like at the DMV insurance, you know, agent, state insurance companies, things

17:12.200 --> 17:13.200
like that.

17:13.200 --> 17:17.120
That's smart, disgruntled the DMV workers more.

17:17.120 --> 17:22.580
they're joking around calling this the country's first anti-solitaire

17:22.580 --> 17:27.980
legislation because literally they would have to pass something in the state

17:27.980 --> 17:32.300
senate that says computers are not allowed to have solitaire installed on

17:32.300 --> 17:37.700
them and I'm just kind of thinking this has really become the new age time sink

17:37.700 --> 17:41.860
here and you know I see it happen at my company where I work I walk around and

17:41.860 --> 17:46.620
when people are feeling unproductive I see bejeweled and what are all those

17:46.620 --> 17:53.820
other games they have on like Yahoo and PopCap, the Insaniquarium I've seen, the Zuma is the

17:53.820 --> 17:54.820
other one.

17:54.820 --> 17:57.660
We don't need to be working my job, we don't have time to be working.

17:57.660 --> 18:04.100
When you're, you know, handling, when I handle something anywhere between 15 to 20 bankruptcy

18:04.100 --> 18:07.740
desk or accounts doing their analyses by hand, no.

18:07.740 --> 18:09.060
I, no, no.

18:09.060 --> 18:10.060
And people that-

18:10.060 --> 18:11.660
They should have all of that locked out.

18:11.660 --> 18:15.740
People that work in construction and jobs like that where you're not necessarily behind

18:15.740 --> 18:20.000
to just probably get pissed off at these kind of stories, especially in North Carolina where

18:20.000 --> 18:24.100
it's like, damn right my tax dollars shouldn't be going to people playing solitaire all day.

18:24.100 --> 18:28.040
I mean, doing it on your breaks, one thing. And to, you know, folks at work's credit,

18:28.040 --> 18:31.700
a lot of folks play Bejeweled on their breaks, and that's cool. You know, do what you want.

18:31.700 --> 18:36.100
I'm just glad that I can still check my school stuff during my lunch. But I miss checking

18:36.100 --> 18:37.100
my LiveJournal.

18:37.100 --> 18:40.780
All right. Loki, did you have something you wanted to share?

18:40.780 --> 18:41.780
Yes, I did.

18:41.780 --> 18:42.780
What's up?

18:42.780 --> 18:50.680
that Tuesday, or at least this last Tuesday, the Matrix beta has ended, and I have to say

18:50.680 --> 18:59.680
they did it in a really interesting way. Apparently the Matrix was being cleansed by a fire virus,

18:59.680 --> 19:05.620
so people started bursting into flames. And I actually, I have some other crap, the sky

19:05.620 --> 19:11.460
turned into a bunch of eyeballs, and I actually have a video here for the, you know, Rob the

19:11.460 --> 19:16.860
to see real quick. Okay. That is creepy as fucking hell. And basically, you know, eyes

19:16.860 --> 19:22.500
floating around, the sky turns, you know, bright red and stuff. And then, I guess at

19:22.500 --> 19:27.260
the very end of the game, once it was done, the, basically your body just gets folded

19:27.260 --> 19:31.680
into a mass. It's like, just really weird. So this just happened to everybody playing

19:31.680 --> 19:35.260
the game at once? Everybody. But it was, it slowly happened. See, first off, they started

19:35.260 --> 19:40.120
with signs start appearing in the game. Like, for instance, there was one sign that said

19:40.120 --> 19:45.320
disobedience is unacceptable. There is another one that says, the further presence in the

19:45.320 --> 19:53.820
Matrix is forbidden. It says, jack out now, discomfort will be extreme. There are signs

19:53.820 --> 19:58.300
in the club, like, time is running out, you are in violation, you are in violation, you

19:58.300 --> 20:03.140
know, you cannot hide, and stuff like that. And apparently gigantic brawls were happening

20:03.140 --> 20:07.380
where like, some of the actual people from the game, or the movies like seraph and stuff

20:07.380 --> 20:12.660
fighting agents and just nuts stuff going on they've got like you know there

20:12.660 --> 20:18.700
was this crazy virus people catching on fire it's just so it was really the

20:18.700 --> 20:22.660
major thing the matrix online folks got pretty clever with how they're gonna end

20:22.660 --> 20:26.100
their beta that was pretty awesome it's just like you imagine you're playing

20:26.100 --> 20:29.740
World of Warcraft and then suddenly your character just sorry but it first into

20:29.740 --> 20:33.100
flames I actually it cuz I only really didn't play I didn't really play the

20:33.100 --> 20:36.980
beta that much if I actually jacked in saw this I'd be like what the hell is

20:36.980 --> 20:42.020
going on I mean there's like beams of light shooting down from the sky and stuff and basically

20:42.020 --> 20:46.360
your character literally just like it's bent over backwards you know sort of looks like

20:46.360 --> 20:52.240
you know the T-1000 getting shot with you know shotgun shots nuts but you know that's

20:52.240 --> 20:55.680
a really good sign at least of how the actual game's gonna be I mean because if they're

20:55.680 --> 21:00.300
putting this much detail into the beta you know to bring up all the hype from this you

21:00.300 --> 21:04.000
gotta wonder what the actual game's gonna be like and so that's I think will be pretty

21:04.000 --> 21:08.940
interesting. I gotta give my hands off to them, that's a pretty clever idea there, so.

21:08.940 --> 21:14.240
I hope this doesn't become a trend in MMOs to, like on April Fools' Day, can you imagine

21:14.240 --> 21:18.560
some different MMOs doing that? Like, you know, Final Fantasy XI suddenly turned the

21:18.560 --> 21:21.360
behemoths loose in the middle of the city. Actually that sounds like something they-

21:21.360 --> 21:23.520
It did that on Ragnarok. I was gonna say, that's something they would've

21:23.520 --> 21:31.880
done on Ragnarok. Dude, I had five wanderers come by and axe me. Actually, in another time,

21:31.880 --> 21:34.640
I was lucky enough that I was high enough level.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.480
I was left with six hit points.

21:37.480 --> 21:41.840
I'm shaking one hit from one to one and my ass ran like hell.

21:41.840 --> 21:45.720
Speaking of World of Warcraft, you guys, just because I was talking about MMOs and stuff

21:45.720 --> 21:48.120
and we were talking about the various ones.

21:48.120 --> 21:53.600
World of Warcraft hit 1.5 million users this week.

21:53.600 --> 21:55.120
I guess that's really all there is to say.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.780
The game just keeps getting bigger.

21:57.780 --> 21:59.440
Won't stop going.

21:59.440 --> 22:04.000
Meanwhile, I'm all getting back into PSO, am I behind the times or what?

22:04.000 --> 22:07.120
I'm still apparently paying for it, I'll play.

22:07.120 --> 22:10.320
Well you know there's some news coming out on the new PSO, we'll be talking about that

22:10.320 --> 22:13.000
in upcoming weeks as more news comes out.

22:13.000 --> 22:19.700
Alright, and of course we here at Orange Lounge Radio on the to-go edition, we are not only

22:19.700 --> 22:23.160
interested in bringing you the gaming news you really want to know, but we want to better

22:23.160 --> 22:24.600
your life.

22:24.600 --> 22:30.400
And who better to better your life with some advice than our very own DarkSakura with her

22:30.400 --> 22:33.640
advice column.

22:33.640 --> 22:36.440
DarkSakura what are you going to share with us tonight?

22:36.440 --> 22:40.680
Today's tip is how to cross a piranha infested river.

22:40.680 --> 22:42.560
And how would one cross the river?

22:42.560 --> 22:45.480
Number one, do not cross if you have an open wound.

22:45.480 --> 22:47.480
Piranhas are attracted to blood.

22:47.480 --> 22:52.680
Number two, avoid areas with netted fish, docks where fish are clean, and areas around

22:52.680 --> 22:58.360
bird rookeries. Piranhas may become habituated to feeding in these areas and may be more

22:58.360 --> 23:03.060
aggressive there. 3. Stay out of the water when piranhas are feeding. When large numbers

23:03.060 --> 23:07.660
of piranhas are attacking prey, a true feeding frenzy, they may snap a bite at anything around

23:07.660 --> 23:13.560
them. If you see them feeding, stay away or well upriver. 4. Across the river at night,

23:13.560 --> 23:17.220
virtually every species of piranha rests at night, and when awakened they will swim away

23:17.220 --> 23:18.700
rather than attack.

23:18.700 --> 23:24.780
Piranhas are more active at dawn, though some large adults may hunt in the evening.

23:24.780 --> 23:25.780
5.

23:25.780 --> 23:28.420
Swim or walk across quickly and quietly.

23:28.420 --> 23:34.420
Do not try to create a large disturbance in the water that might awaken piranhas.

23:34.420 --> 23:36.260
Be aware.

23:36.260 --> 23:38.700
Piranhas are freshwater tropical fish.

23:38.700 --> 23:41.340
In the wild, they only exist in South America.

23:41.340 --> 23:45.860
In slow-moving rivers, backwaters, or floodplain lakes, piranhas generally do not live in either

23:45.860 --> 23:50.820
mountain lakes or streams. Water is too cold and flows too fast. Piranhas generally do not

23:50.820 --> 23:55.140
attack humans or large animals unless they are already dead or injured. During the dry season,

23:55.140 --> 24:00.180
however, when food is scarce, piranhas can be more aggressive. When driving cattle across a river

24:00.180 --> 24:04.420
suspected of containing piranhas, farmers will sometimes sacrifice a sick or injured animal

24:04.420 --> 24:09.460
downstream before letting the herd enter the water. Now the final piece of advice, Matt,

24:09.460 --> 24:15.760
uh-huh don't cross the river in South America don't go near the piranhas and

24:15.760 --> 24:24.160
if you have to bring a gun all right dynamite dynamite hey thank you for that

24:24.160 --> 24:27.760
helpful piece of advice just in case I should ever find myself in a piranha

24:27.760 --> 24:33.960
infested river appreciate it all right from piranhas to turtles

24:33.960 --> 24:41.160
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Mutant Melee is coming out on Xbox, GameCube, and PC.

24:41.160 --> 24:47.140
It actually, it isn't coming out, it just came out this week. It is by the same

24:47.140 --> 24:50.740
folks, by the way, who did Dance Dance Revolution Ultra Mix, the folks in

24:50.740 --> 24:55.740
Konami Hawaii actually put this game together. It is kind of, I guess if you

24:55.740 --> 25:00.980
really wanted to roughly describe this game, it's Mario Party with Ninja Turtles.

25:00.980 --> 25:04.780
Not just the Ninja Turtles though, 16 other playable characters

25:04.780 --> 25:08.780
Casey Jones, Shredder, et cetera, et cetera.

25:08.780 --> 25:11.780
Rated T for teens. It's a budget game, $19.99.

25:11.780 --> 25:15.180
It would make me happy if it has a soggy Yojimbo in it.

25:15.180 --> 25:18.180
I don't have the list of characters, so no idea.

25:18.180 --> 25:21.980
But you know, I think it's weird that there's all these Mario Party knock-offs,

25:21.980 --> 25:24.280
yet I have yet to play one

25:24.280 --> 25:28.180
as good as Mario Party. And they have Mario Party Advance now too.

25:28.180 --> 25:34.980
mmm I saw that store very curious about Mario Party 6 I'm sorry yeah I mean like

25:34.980 --> 25:38.900
I've played the sonic one which I didn't really care for I played the crash

25:38.900 --> 25:43.380
bandicoot one which I really really didn't care for I played the Namco one a

25:43.380 --> 25:51.080
little bit which was and so I think just leave it to the folks who do it best

25:51.080 --> 25:59.640
thank you lastly a little story on halo 2 I think this is interesting on a

25:59.640 --> 26:06.720
Korean Xbox website the official Korean Xbox website it says coming soon and it

26:06.720 --> 26:16.600
calls this game the x-pack which is a halo 2 expansion pack hmm no comment

26:16.600 --> 26:20.960
officially yet as to what this might mean for American audiences Canada will

26:20.960 --> 26:24.680
it first. But wouldn't that be interesting you know you get all these

26:24.680 --> 26:28.280
people to buy this game and a lot of people were saying that the ending to

26:28.280 --> 26:34.280
Halo 2 was a little lacking on final geez surprise now you got to spend

26:34.280 --> 26:39.640
another $20 on the expansion pack to really finish the game. I tell you Canada

26:39.640 --> 26:43.120
is gonna have it before we do because remember they got the crystal Xbox.

26:43.120 --> 26:48.320
Oh that's true. They get all their neat stuff there first. That's true. Their

26:48.320 --> 26:54.560
Christmas bundle came with like Halo 2 and some other really big game where we

26:54.560 --> 26:59.400
got what to like off-road games I know but what FIFA soccer and like some other

26:59.400 --> 27:06.200
thing is tennis I don't know is this something that I know you guys aren't

27:06.200 --> 27:09.520
really huge on Halo but what do you think of this whole expansion back

27:09.520 --> 27:13.880
sucker America into buying the game and then release the expansion pack it's

27:13.880 --> 27:17.880
kind of interesting more fodder for my motion sickness I can't think of any

27:17.880 --> 27:24.480
other companies that do that Maxis I guess that's true I guess it's just part

27:24.480 --> 27:29.080
of the game to bust it out all right well I always assumed they were setting

27:29.080 --> 27:33.640
up for Halo 3 but it'll be interesting if it's an expansion pack they're

27:33.640 --> 27:39.600
setting up for Halo 3 all right I bet I wouldn't doubt it see they're worried

27:39.600 --> 27:44.480
they're worried about one game coming out in that game times players 3 future

27:44.480 --> 27:51.840
Oh, yeah, I'm sure. Hey, okay, that game has the oddest characters ever. I love that game. You're the only fan of that game

27:51.840 --> 27:56.440
I've ever met. I also like Twisted Metal. I do love Twisted Metal that game rocks

27:57.640 --> 28:04.220

28:17.720 --> 28:18.720
of them.

28:18.720 --> 28:21.400

Laser beams on their frickin' heads?

28:23.600 --> 28:25.320
Laser beams and floating eyeballs.

28:25.320 --> 28:30.320
But the floating eyeballs, I've got to say this, almost a rip-off of Lord of the Rings.

28:30.320 --> 28:31.320
Almost.

28:31.320 --> 28:32.920
Gettin' close.

28:32.920 --> 28:39.800
