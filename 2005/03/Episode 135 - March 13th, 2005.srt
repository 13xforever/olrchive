You might know me as Skye, joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.

20
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:25,040
In this corner, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Sommers, you

21
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,620
know her better as Dark Sakura.

22
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,420
Now long to free.

23
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,820
Yes, no long butter this week.

24
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:35,080
Well, um, but I'm mostly better.

25
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,680
Sounds good to me.

26
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,680
And in this corner, saving our sound at the last second here tonight, we are having some

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,880
major sound issues just 30 seconds ago.

28
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,480
Say hello to Loki!

29
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:55,120
Alright, and also joining us tonight, a veteran of our program, a veteran guest, she's been

30
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,620
down in the trenches, and she knows how to butter the host of the show up.

31
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:03,000
Say hello to DDR Angel.

32
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,000
Hello.

33
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Alright.

34
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:12,560
Well, it should be another fun-filled show tonight.

35
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,440
We've got all the regular stuff you like to hear, our weeks, our day, cage match, and

36
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:20,640
who knows what else?

37
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,640
Possibly some Bahmani news and all that fun stuff as well.

38
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:28,500
We will get into that when we come back from a quick break, and this break, I don't really

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:33,800
have an idea for music that I want to hear in particular, so I think we'll just kind

40
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,000
of do some Bahmani randomness.

41
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,160
We'll start it off with some Thomas Howard LECHSCHRISCHEIN!

42
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:47,160
We'll be back after this.

43
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,960
You want to follow me

44
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,660
Wear dresses too tight

45
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:19,660
But you can't let her see you there

46
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:21,660
But she's a hot one

47
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,160
And a fiend

48
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,660
Tú la senorita

49
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:28,160
You'll never get those in love

50
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,160
Tú la senorita

51
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,160
Hoorah!

52
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:37,160
A lot of women

53
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:49,160
I know she has a mind and an attitude And she has a space and a style and a tune

54
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:52,160
She sees you, believes you, feeling good over you

55
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Like you knew she would when she smiled It's like the sun shining on your face

56
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:05,160
Falling and stretching the land of the day

57
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:11,160
And she's a hot woman, a little young, full of senorita

58
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:16,160
Mom, California, full of senorita

59
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:21,160
Who loves a European?

60
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,160
Who can make waves all over town?

61
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,160
Can you see me comin'? Everybody dancin' around

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:53,160
With a spoon can do the talkin' back down, down

63
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:11,160
I'm a lazy man that's a turtle, not too free

64
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,160
I told your daughter, can't stay up all week

65
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:24,160
And I feel good for the road I'm sliding next to you

66
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:44,160
Yeah, this is your roundabout of pain Nobody's getting my way

67
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:53,160
Heaven in the 50s, heaven in the 70s, yeah

68
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:07,160
I was the happiest guy

69
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,160
That's what everyone said

70
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:15,160
And never once thought I was lonely then

71
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,160
Still, I believe in nothing so well

72
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,160
No one could ever tell

73
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:27,160
Just a funny face

74
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,160
On an empty shell

75
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:35,160
And when you came along

76
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:38,160
You didn't even see I was wrong

77
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:45,160
I know it's just my mind, but I don't really care cause I'm down

78
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:53,160
I'm with you, I'm with you, don't bring me down

79
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I'm with you, I'm with you, don't bring me down

80
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:10,160
When I dream of you, I want you to learn to do what you just do.

81
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Tell me now, what you want to do.

82
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,160
Tell me now, what you want to do.

83
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:26,160
I want to stay in the car, and you never know.

84
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,160
Show me what is better, don't you know.

85
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:40,160
I don't know what you mean to me, but what you mean I don't know

86
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,560
you know, stuff happens. So Ballad For You was a mistake. No, Ballad For You is not a

87
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,040
mistake.

88
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,240
Just like this next song, The Torture will continue here with Thomas Howard. One

89
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:08,720
more song.

90
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
We'll be back after this.

91
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:42,720
It's such a special day

92
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,720
Tonight is the night for our love yous

93
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:55,720
Wish we could have this evening

94
00:10:55,720 --> 00:11:00,720
The year Christmas is here

95
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,720
Christmas is here

96
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:13,720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

97
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,720
Night falls on you

98
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,720
And if you know

99
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,720
We need you

100
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,720
My heart is beating with you

101
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:34,720
You are the light of the night on my side

102
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,720
I'm a mama, you know I can fall

103
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:41,720
I'm a thousand fears, your heart is strong

104
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,720
Christmas is here

105
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,720
Orange Lounge Radio

106
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:54,720
Bomani Music

107
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,720
And more

108
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:56,720
Perfect!

109
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

110
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:01,720
Hope you enjoyed that break full of Thomas Howard

111
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,720
He's named after a small country in Europe

112
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,720
So, that's a fun little segment there

113
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,120
there. You know, and it's funny because our chat room is very polarized there where some

114
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:18,300
folks are like, Fuck you! I can't believe you're playing this! Fuck you guys on Orange

115
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:21,180
Lounge Radio! You guys suck! I can't believe we're listening to you guys! And then some

116
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:26,820
guys are like, Yay! I love Orange Lounge Radio because they play Tom and Tom! Yay! If they

117
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:33,040
hate us so much, why are they listening? Because, secretly, they know the next break will be

118
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,000
something decent. You know, we play things from the entire Bimani spectrum. It'll be

119
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,680
a break of nothing but I love that feeling. Little do they realize it's the Thomas Howard

120
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:48,560
show today and they won't be getting anything else. I swear to God I will be playing Forever

121
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:56,080
Sunshine next break. But with... Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob. What? Play

122
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,180
the song and I will kill you. Well, there's actually damn good reason to be playing Forever

123
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,980
Sunshine next break and I'll get into that later. I will kill you with a ferret. I will

124
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,800
kill you in the house I will kill you with the mouse will you will you kill me

125
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:15,100
in a bus will you get on it wasn't this like six weeks ago when we got into this

126
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:26,320
yeah dr. Seuss show dr. redfish bluefish and you got a deal yes would you piss on

127
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:34,240
a train with all right stop stop anyway I was gonna say that I liked Elle

128
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:47,240
I love this station, giving the fans what they don't want.

129
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:53,680
You know that neon FM game that's coming out, the new one with the pad that's going to look

130
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,360
like a Beatmania pad, so I've been joking and calling this game Feetmania FM.

131
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,980
It has a lot of Thomas Howard in it.

132
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,980
Thomas Howard.

133
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Yay!

134
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:08,400
So, and there's supposed to be a song called Girl's Butts.

135
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:14,740
I'm looking very forward to being able to play that one on the station, so we'll see.

136
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:19,420
Our webcam is not up just yet, but look, he's getting that set up right now as we speak.

137
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,420
We're kind of getting the ball rolling very last minute tonight, because, you know, we

138
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:26,500
just had better things to do, like Final Fantasy XI, and, um...

139
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,500
I only played once this week.

140
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,500
Actually, I've been pretty good on the Final Fantasy XI addiction this week.

141
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,500
I actually played DDR today.

142
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:42,500
Granted, I was playing controller on Ultramix 2 on Xbox Live, but I was actually having fun.

143
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,500
But I'll get into that later.

144
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:48,500
Let's start off tonight's show as we always do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

145
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:50,500
Starting off with the lovely Dark Sakura.

146
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,500
I spent the whole week on coding.

147
00:14:52,500 --> 00:15:00,500
I went to the doctor, and he gave me some lovely drugs, except I misread the label in my sickness and read teaspoon as tablespoon.

148
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:09,500
So all Monday at work, I was taking this gua-phenicin with codeine syrup at basically triple doses four times a day.

149
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:15,500
I was high as a kite and feeling little pain. I was very happy.

150
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,500
Remember kids, drugs are bad.

151
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,500
Okay.

152
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:29,580
But, uh, yes they do. What you talking about? We do endorse burping off the couch.

153
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:35,300
You endorse recreational Waltussin use? I don't take Waltussin anymore. It's got sugar

154
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:43,460
in it. Oh. But they make sugar-free Coca Cola.

155
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:47,820
I don't know why things that aren't usually funny are funny tonight. Maybe I'm high on

156
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:53,740
I don't know you you sound like you're still coughing up a little bit of lung

157
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:57,860
butter over there yeah but it's a good thing because I have a voice finally

158
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:02,780
sort of that's good I think with my CD player today it was great tonight you

159
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:15,300
don't sound like grandma orange lounge I got a good but uh I you know the week

160
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:20,300
I think it was pretty much normal crap. I, of course, didn't go to the gym, but I did go yesterday.

161
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:26,300
I went to spin class, and I was very sad because the teacher who I wanted to teach a spin class wasn't teaching it,

162
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:31,300
because she might be sick with other issues, and so I'm really worried.

163
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,300
But my friend...

164
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,300
I just ferreted Jamie's laptop.

165
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:39,300
You touch the pressures and you die.

166
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Sorry.

167
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,300
You go to hell and you die!

168
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:51,340
anyway. Rob just picked his nose. I did not pick my nose, I scratched my nose. If the

169
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:57,740
webcam faced over here, I'd demand an instant replay. Yeah, too bad that you'd have to be

170
00:16:57,740 --> 00:17:03,880
picking your nose for like a minute straight for that to work. Wow, you really did fuss

171
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:10,860
with that mic, that's good and loud now. I tell you, it's probably just because, you

172
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:16,620
You know, pulling cords out through, you know, over the, um, audio board there, every now

173
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,980
and then a cord gets stuck on a knob, and then, you know, the knob turns, and then the

174
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:23,420
audio gets all fucked up.

175
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,660
Needs to be, like, in a glass case or something.

176
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:27,980
Loki has his magic gummy bears again.

177
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:28,980
Dun dun dun!

178
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:33,580
Seriously, if you guys were listening to the podcast this last week, Loki was, like, turned

179
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:39,460
down to, like, 20% level or something, but it was pleasant, because his anger was subdued.

180
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:47,860
I still have to tell you about my damn week!

181
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:52,620
For those people wondering why this segment takes so damn long, this is why, right here.

182
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,340
It's called We Digress.

183
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:02,380
Anyway, I hung out with my friend Melody yesterday, who is not Sharks Girl.

184
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:11,020
She is a friend of mine who I worked with at the evil student loan company and she met

185
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:18,900
her fiance through work and he lives in Delaware so she's moving to Delaware next month.

186
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,860
We're in Delaware in Delaware.

187
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,580
Okay, knock it off.

188
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:29,400
But anyway, this is the last chance I really get to hang out with her so we went to see

189
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:34,600
Constantine yesterday which I actually liked and I've even read a little bit of

190
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:38,840
the Hellblazer comics so where it was a bit different I actually liked it as a

191
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:45,040
movie it was pretty cool I think is how I like movies that just totally screw

192
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:50,680
with theology and you know yeah that's also I guess the reason why I like Angel

193
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:58,520
Sanctuary too um anyway we saw that I went to her apartment to meet her cat

194
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:02,560
Simon she went to my apartment to meet Shermy she took two pictures of me and

195
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:12,800
five pictures of Shermy anyway we went I took her to meet Dan and Dan did his

196
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,960
stuff he was working so then we went to Chevy's which but has did he managed to

197
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,120
sell any ignition pads I don't know I don't care I don't keep up with that he's

198
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,600
up to an inventory tonight okay um but we went to Chevy's and then went to

199
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,360
cheesecake factory I decided to make yesterday my cheat day so the box of

200
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:35,600
Samoas is gonna wait until my birthday because that's my next cheat day I'm

201
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:43,360
having two cheat days next month and then we went back and Dan came home when

202
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,080
we were hanging out at my place because I was burning off the copy of Battle Royale

203
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:56,040
for her and we watched the ring and the part of the an evening with Kevin Smith

204
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Isn't The Ring 2 out this week?

205
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,040
I don't know, is it this week?

206
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
This Friday.

207
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
Holy shit, I have to go.

208
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:10,040
I'm looking to see, I want to see because I heard that they were trying to incorporate some stuff from the books.

209
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:15,040
And I really like the books over the movies because the books go in such a completely different direction.

210
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Which I kind of wish the movies had, but it would not have been realistic.

211
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:28,200
So I'm really curious and otherwise today's been kind of, oh yeah, today I actually was

212
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:33,520
outside taking pictures of nature because for my Photoshop class I have to do a composite

213
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:38,200
of three pictures into like a fantasy setting.

214
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:43,000
And I've got one of a bridge and like two other ones and eh, I'm going to play with

215
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,000
them.

216
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
I got my pictures from Alabama developed.

217
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I managed to spend $75 at Walgreens.

218
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Did they let you do digital photography and photo classes now?

219
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Because when I was in college you had to use the old cameras...

220
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,000
This isn't a photo class. This is Photoshop.

221
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

222
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,000
And he doesn't care how we get him as long as we get him.

223
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
I gotcha.

224
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Um...

225
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,000
But...

226
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,000
That's pretty much it and I got to hang out with Dan and Julie today.

227
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,000
And then Dan had to go to work and I went back home.

228
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Ah!

229
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:52,000
spots yesterday, and that was okay. It was free, and I got a lot of popcorn, so that was all good.

230
00:21:52,000 --> 00:22:03,000
And then, um, yesterday we watched SpongeBob SquarePants, the movie, and that movie is weird.

231
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:10,000
I'm a goopy goober, yeah. You're a goopy goober, yeah. That movie rocked, I absolutely loved it.

232
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:14,000
This is so random, it's just... I don't even know.

233
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:20,000
I mean, I was kind of a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants before, but now, like, oh my god, he's so awesome.

234
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,000
I can safely say I have never, ever, ever, ever seen any.

235
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,000
You need to see the movie. It is awesome.

236
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Honestly, I hate SpongeBob SquarePants, but the movie was good. I like the movie.

237
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:37,000
I find SpongeBob SquarePants to be completely retarded and just annoying, and the movie was just...

238
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:43,000
It was so different from the show. It was kind of weird because it was actually, you know, very random sort of like...

239
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,000
It was what Nellie said. It was a stoner movie.

240
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
It was a stoner movie.

241
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
It was Cheech and Chong.

242
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:52,000
It was just like, and it was like, they had so many homosexual innuendos in that movie.

243
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Like, especially the ending where they do like a kiss-type ending.

244
00:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Forget, I don't know if there was a kiss movie. I'm sure there was.

245
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:07,120
was but it's totally the kiss ending and then they was a Patrick is wearing

246
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:14,600
fishnet stockings yes and stilettos stilettos it's just rubber boots it's

247
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:20,520
just weird but um I don't know it was kind of funny it was just a completely

248
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:27,200
different none earlier in the week I had watched white noise and that movie was

249
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:34,300
And, um, yeah. It was weird. They're just so gonna... It just, like, had an ending that

250
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:39,480
made no sense in that movie. It's just... You're leading up, you find there's this guy,

251
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:44,040
you know, and there's these three ghosts that have been killing people, and then, you know,

252
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,960
the resolution to the movie, the ghosts break every bone in this guy's body and throw him

253
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:55,200
off a building. The end. I was like, oh, gee, thanks! That's nice. So now I've been told

254
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,200
by my fiance that I'm not supposed to meddle with the dead. I'm still gonna.

255
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:08,200
Yeah, just open your gateway to hell. I know! Every time I think about doing it, I get tired.

256
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:19,200
We'll sell soul for Gil. Yeah. Anyways. And then, um, what else did I do this week? Eh,

257
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:24,200
Yeah, that much. That's about it. You know, just kind of playing Final Fantasy and...

258
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:32,200
Yeah, I just did nothing. Like usual. Still waiting for my damn interview. For the game's sales position.

259
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,200
Still waiting.

260
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,200
Okay.

261
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,200
And that's it.

262
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,200
Alright. Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

263
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,200
Oh, wait. Actually, before we get into that, I actually got a clip. Sorry, Angel.

264
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:51,200
I got a clip of that song, Girls Butts, Mikle Tom somehow had it and he sent it over to me.

265
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:57,200
Oh, yeah

266
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,840
Actually, I don't think that version in particular is sung by Thomas Howard.

267
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,080
I think that is DJ Potato doing that one.

268
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:34,120
But it's the same song, so you can get a pretty good idea there.

269
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,120
Very interesting.

270
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,800
Okay, just wanted to follow up there.

271
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,800
Angel.

272
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:40,520
I wish this week never existed.

273
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,520
Ever.

274
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:42,520
Ever.

275
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:46,520
I wish it never existed.

276
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:54,520
Monday through Wednesday was just fine, and all that good stuff.

277
00:25:54,520 --> 00:26:00,520
Went to school and worked a little, and just all that other stuff.

278
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:02,520
And then Thursday was school.

279
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:07,520
And then I come to find out when I come home, as soon as I sat down for my computer,

280
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:11,520
that my friend had passed away.

281
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:20,520
And it's one of the guys that I knew in two years in the DJ field, you know, on the radio and stuff.

282
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:30,520
And let's just say since Thursday it's been kind of a screwed up four days and sleep's been a joke.

283
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:36,520
And just, you know, me and my other friends have been hanging around there and just comforting each other.

284
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:40,520
And just, you know, stuff that you need to do when somebody passes away.

285
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:47,920
I haven't felt this much like sorrow and pain for a really long time and it's just kind

286
00:26:47,920 --> 00:26:51,500
of you know I mean I know I'm gonna get through it I know that all my friends are gonna get

287
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:57,600
through it but the main thing is we shouldn't forget him and we're not going to and all

288
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:02,680
that stuff and I just had a really hard week or at least the last four days it's getting

289
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:10,280
better but you know there's just little things that remind you of this you know somebody

290
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:14,840
like you'll be walking down the street and you'll see somebody wear a shirt and that

291
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:18,920
shirt like reminds you of the person that you just lost and just little stuff like that

292
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:26,560
and so yeah I've been grieving all week except for the first three days of the week so it's

293
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:31,400
been pretty shitty week and I really don't really want to think about it anyway that's

294
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,680
it I'm sorry to hear about it and I hope you

295
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:43,480
you know, things get better for you and everything. Wow, how the hell do I follow that? Uh, Angel?

296
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:47,840
Being here helps, so. I think we should play the girl's butt song again. Aw, jeez. Actually,

297
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:52,000
maybe if I play the girl's butt song again, um, Angel will feel a little better.

298
00:27:52,000 --> 00:28:05,000
This game has come in every shape and size God says I'll have my time lookin' at girls' butts Wonderin' fish is a crime

299
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:28,500
Alright, and did the girl's butt song make you feel any better at all miss miss dark sacra? I?

300
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Am not coughing

301
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,400
Did girls butts get rid of your cough. I guess so Wow

302
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:42,360
Butts is healed me. Oh my god. I felt the power of the girls, but so

303
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:54,980
Oh my god, this song cures cancer.

304
00:28:54,980 --> 00:29:01,140
Don't tell me that Orange Lounge doesn't better your life, everybody.

305
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,140
My week and my day.

306
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,140
Shit.

307
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,500
What did I do?

308
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Not a whole lot.

309
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:10,900
I also watched the Spongebob Squarepants movie Friday night, which I thought was awesome.

310
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:14,900
And I also watched this other movie last night, which was very odd. It was called The Final Cut.

311
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,900
Final Cut with Robin Williams.

312
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:19,900
Which, I had never heard of this movie in theaters.

313
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:20,900
It was very limited.

314
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,900
Very, very, very limited, apparently.

315
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,900
So, there was that.

316
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,900
And, um...

317
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,900
I thought that movie was very, um...

318
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,900
Well, obviously it's not what you'd expect from a Robin Williams movie, because it was very dark.

319
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,900
He also did the one-hour photo.

320
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,900
I saw that one. That one's weird.

321
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:42,500
so all sorts of like very unsettling movies there

322
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:48,380
um but yeah it was different but I liked it it was a thought-provoking movie it

323
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,180
kinda made you go

324
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:52,820
that's interesting Friday night I went out to the bar

325
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:56,380
and it was cool cuz there was this guy that thought it was cool that I play

326
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:56,900
games

327
00:29:56,900 --> 00:30:00,340
so we talked for a little while and it was weird though because he's not

328
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:04,540
he's kind of not a big Nintendo supporter

329
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,620
so I had to talk to him about why I believe the GameCube is awesome and all

330
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:08,300
that so

331
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:13,140
This is interesting. Um, on the outside of that, you know,

332
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:18,300
just same old stuff. Went out to karaoke earlier this week because I'm a total karaoke

333
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,060
whore. I love it.

334
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:23,220
And, uh, actually I went twice this week. That's what a big karaoke whore I am.

335
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:26,660
I went on Monday night when it's not the usual karaoke guy that I'm

336
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:30,140
used to. It just wasn't the same. It really wasn't the same.

337
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:33,820
Um, and that's that. That's it for me.

338
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:37,620
Alright, um, let's see. So,

339
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:43,820
We're going to get into another break here and in this break we're going to play two

340
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:49,260
songs and these two songs have something in common and I'll talk about what these songs

341
00:30:49,260 --> 00:30:52,620
have in common when we come back after this.

342
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:57,580
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back.

343
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:31,620
City long beach and sand tickles your feet

344
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:34,620
That's when the winds blow your head

345
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:40,620
The kids fly forever sunshine

346
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:44,620
Crying forever sunshine

347
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,620
Crying forever sunshine

348
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:56,620
This is for the sunshine, and you must be kind

349
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:03,620
You can be the sunshine, like the sun in the sunshine

350
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:52,300
You think you could have another baby I could have been a hero today

351
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:59,300
You could have another baby Shine like the stars up in the sky

352
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,300
All of your regrets

353
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,900
That they choose us like an atomic bomb

354
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,500
Taken at the point of view

355
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,100
You should have another way to choose

356
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,700
And say that truth brings no use

357
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:23,300
When you've got your futures

358
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,300
I wish I'd light the stars up in the sky

359
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,300
Because

360
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:41,300
It's a fantasy

361
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:44,300
Passing by

362
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:48,300
Just seeing reality

363
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:52,300
And dreaming like a jewel

364
00:33:52,300 --> 00:34:00,300
Cause it is the only thing to make a future shine

365
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,300
Alright, those two songs have something in common

366
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:09,300
If you haven't figured it out yet, we'll play two more songs that should give you a little bit of a hint.

367
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:39,300
So lovely

368
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,300
So soft

369
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:46,300
So soft

370
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:48,300
So stop, stop

371
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,300
I see what's wrong with me

372
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,300
I just want to be the driver

373
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:13,300
I just want to be the mother

374
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,300
I just want to be myself

375
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,800
As we take away the night has shown the way

376
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:25,800
We didn't notice the light

377
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:29,800
We disappear

378
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,800
Fly away to find the sea

379
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:38,300
Feeling love is so deep

380
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:42,800
Until we reach eternity

381
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,800
Just the

382
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,800
Just the free

383
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,400
Free

384
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,000
People free

385
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,600
Do you feel it?

386
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:41,580
I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming

387
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:52,200
I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming,

388
00:36:52,200 --> 00:37:06,200
I'll see you in the evening

389
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,200
Did you hear it?

390
00:37:52,200 --> 00:38:03,400
Hey, did you hear about that show?

391
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,400
What show?

392
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,640
Well, they play a lot of greats and money and video game music, but if you listen to

393
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,640
it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

394
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,360
Oh, I've heard of that station.

395
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,360
Really?

396
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,720
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

397
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:17,320
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

398
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,320
Well, you die.

399
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:19,320
I what?

400
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,320
Hey, wait!

401
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:26,440
Hey! Wait! What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

402
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:34,180
Orange Lounge Radio. Listen to Oberguy!

403
00:38:34,180 --> 00:38:37,700
We haven't had an excuse to play that one in a while, but since you guys were talking about, you know,

404
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:41,240
um, uh, The Ring 2 coming out soon and

405
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:46,120
you talking about, you know, um, you watching The Ring this week and stuff?

406
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,240
You can totally see up my nose in this picture.

407
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,460
You know, that makes for great radio.

408
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:53,040
I like Dan's smile, he's like,

409
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:56,000
Ahh!

410
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,200
He looks like SpongeBob did in that movie when he got all happy.

411
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:02,720
Do not compare my man to SpongeBob.

412
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:06,080
Alright, anyway, so if you didn't figure it out,

413
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:10,920
Forever Sunshine and Regret, a song from Keyboard Mania that we played in there too,

414
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:11,900
you may not have recognized that,

415
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:16,240
those are two songs that are assumably in the next song pack. Now we haven't

416
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,800
heard anything official yet,

417
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:23,540
But, basically what happened is that ZipTie, who you know from DDRFreak and the message

418
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:27,480
boards over there, she's the one that helps out, I'm not sure if she does single-handedly

419
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:32,180
or if she just has a major hand in the Ultramix 2 website, well she put up some web-based

420
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,860
clues on what's going to be in the next song pack.

421
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,900
And people have deduced the clues, and you know what, they all make sense, so people

422
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,200
are just pretty much assuming they've got them right.

423
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,420
So Regret and Forever Sunshine, two of the songs that are going to be in there.

424
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:47,820
and we'll play some of the other songs a little bit more later and of course I

425
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:52,300
feel the junk circuit mix and more deep or songs that were in the last song pack

426
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:55,940
so a little hint for you so yes boys and girls you get to download forever

427
00:39:55,940 --> 00:40:05,620
sunshine in the next song pack for DDR doesn't that make you excited oh yay

428
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:12,860
we now there's an interesting kind of side note to this on the forever

429
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:18,620
sunshine and actually did you know that there is one person who is responsible

430
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:23,660
for forever sunshine ending up in the next song pack so I thought we could

431
00:40:23,660 --> 00:40:27,420
actually call that person right now and give them a little piece of our mind

432
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:35,980
because I'm sure you want to you want to share this so hello hi is this Seagurd

433
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:40,260
hi it's wow you're really quiet right now but that's alright this is Rob on

434
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:47,260
Orange Launch Radio. Hey, what's up? Not a lot. So, tell me about Forever Sunshine being

435
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:54,260
in the next song pack. What do you mean, tell you about it? It's there, and it's awesome,

436
00:40:54,260 --> 00:41:00,260
and everybody who hates it should just go and die. Why did you put, why Forever Sunshine?

437
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:06,260
Is this your fault? Did you do this? Yeah, it's my fault. How is this your fault? Well,

438
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:11,860
Well, I picked a whole bunch of songs that I personally like. I didn't care if the other people liked them or not.

439
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:22,260
Like, Forever Sunshine, like, Fall Alika, that's all me right there, OGC, uh, Regret, those are songs I like, and I was like, well, they'd be cool for DDR, so I suggested them.

440
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:26,260
But Forever Sunshine was already in DDR, and it sucks!

441
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:29,760
Yeah, well, it was that, or you could have Let Them Move.

442
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:32,760
I'd almost rather have Let Them Move. Would it be like a junk circuit mix?

443
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,760
Well, you don't count now, do you?

444
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:38,760
I guess not. I'm mad at you.

445
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,760
That's okay. You can take it out on me by hitting me at E3 when you go.

446
00:41:42,760 --> 00:41:46,760
I will.

447
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:50,760
Now are we going to expect to see crappy songs that you picked

448
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,760
in the next song pack, or?

449
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:56,760
Heck yeah. I mean, if you remember way back when UltraMix 2

450
00:41:56,760 --> 00:42:00,760
was done and they started announcing stuff about song packs, one of the other

451
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:06,200
other Vivid members said right out loud that a lot of my random one, just me suggesting

452
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,740
that nobody else thought they were good, songs actually made it into song packs, so you haven't

453
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:12,420
heard the last of my takes.

454
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:16,720
So if you guys think the songs that are in the song packs suck, you know where to address

455
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,720
those cards and letters.

456
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,080
Yeah, you've got more song packs to worry about.

457
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,160
I know, I'm like, we're only halfway there, barely.

458
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,380
Yeah, exactly, so.

459
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:35,980
DarkSakra, any choice words for Seagurd? Dot, dot, dot.

460
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:42,140
Loki, any choice words for Seagurd on his selection of Forever Sunshine?

461
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,060
I don't care, because I already have that stupid song.

462
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:51,920
Incept Mania, uh-huh. I'm not buying no fucking song pack, nor am

463
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:55,080
I getting Ultra Mix 2. You don't even have an Xbox, so you don't

464
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:07,360
account. Well, I have an Xbox shell. But, yeah, you know what? You guys got to pay for

465
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:12,040
five dollars for shit. I know, if I want to pay, like, if I want to pay five dollars to

466
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,600
get cool songs, like the other songs that were announced, like... Dude, hello? What

467
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:20,880
the hell? Okay, let's pick Forever Sunshine, because that's so much better than... I can't

468
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:27,880
Oh, I was saying, what's cooler than Forever Sunshine? You could save $5 for that. You should steal privilege.

469
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,380
Um, I don't know, how about every other Bhimani song in existence is cooler than Forever Sunshine?

470
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:35,380
Whatever.

471
00:43:35,880 --> 00:43:37,380
I have an idea!

472
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:39,380
Forever Sunshine rocks!

473
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:46,880
Let's just get that because, you know, songs like The Fall or Hellscraper, or I don't know, whatever else we can put out there.

474
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:55,380
You know, maybe anything that's in 2DX, you know, Ted Style, or anything below that, or I don't know, Beatmanium, you know?

475
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:56,880
All those songs suck.

476
00:43:56,880 --> 00:44:04,880
Come on! How often do you get a random, just, one song that's appeared in only one mix, you know, just appear out of nowhere?

477
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,880
We've got 2DX songs. We don't need more 2DX songs. We're done with 2DX songs.

478
00:44:08,880 --> 00:44:14,880
That's why I pick songs from Keyboard Mania, and Drum Mania, and one-time uses in DDR.

479
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:16,880
Secret, I have a question for you. Do you like The Muppets?

480
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,880
Muppets? No?

481
00:44:18,880 --> 00:44:22,880
Well, because Forever Sunshine sounds like Miss Piggy singing it!

482
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,880
Did you know that Malcolm in the Middle guy sounds like Kermit now?

483
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:32,880
Is the Rainbow Connection going to be in the next song pack? That's what I'm curious about.

484
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:34,880
The what?

485
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,880
The Rainbow Connect- oh, forget it.

486
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,880
Forget it.

487
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:41,880
My insults are lost on you.

488
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,880
They really are.

489
00:44:44,880 --> 00:44:45,880
Alright, well thanks.

490
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:49,880
Anything else you want to share with our listener Seeker before I hang up on you out of pure anger?

491
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:58,880
So, I guess they should just learn to deal with what they're given. That's it. They should shut up and quit being like DDR freak.

492
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:24,560
revolution in Bamani, you know when I, like, was announced like a month ago and I completely

493
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:29,500
forgot to mention on this program until just right now? Um, that Bamani karaoke revolution

494
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:37,500
game got cancelled. So those of you guys that wanted to sing Love Shine at home and stuff,

495
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:42,400
sorry. No karaoke for you.

496
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:43,400
Funny.

497
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:50,400
cuz i saw that forever sunshine was in it

498
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:57,400
yeah i guess forever sunshine was in the next karaoke revolution game

499
00:45:57,400 --> 00:46:03,400
the memani one and so they had to cancel it because they realized that sucks

500
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:08,400
they couldn't put forever sunshine in there because i don't know

501
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:13,400
Just sucks. I had something there, but it just went away.

502
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Alright. I'm gonna need more gummy bears.

503
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:21,400
Out of curiosity, you started off last week with a five pound bag of gummy bears. How many pounds are left?

504
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:25,400
Probably like a pound and a half. That's a lot of gummy.

505
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,400
I helped, though. I did help.

506
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,400
I have about a pound left.

507
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:35,400
I was offering gummy bears to people. I said, hi. I know these are my roommates, but you want some gummy bears?

508
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:41,400
One summer I went through three bags in about a week.

509
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:42,400
Oh my god.

510
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:48,020
It's great when you leave them in your car and they get all stuck together like a big

511
00:46:48,020 --> 00:46:49,900
gummy mass.

512
00:46:49,900 --> 00:46:54,140
Alright, let's talk about some Bimani news.

513
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:57,580
This isn't necessarily Bimani per se, but it has to do with the Dance Mania series,

514
00:46:57,580 --> 00:47:00,860
which is where a lot of Bimani songs came from, so I know a lot of you guys are into

515
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,660
the Dance Mania series.

516
00:47:02,660 --> 00:47:06,660
Dance Mania Speed G4 has been announced.

517
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,660
You know, I have issues with this already.

518
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,660
Why? Why?

519
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,660
Well, because there's G4 in it.

520
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:16,660
Well, that's the name of the album is Dance Mania Speed G4.

521
00:47:16,660 --> 00:47:19,660
And how appropriate that it should be named that.

522
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:25,660
You get songs like Toxic, the trance speedo mix by Helen.

523
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:30,660
And you get other songs like Let's Groove by Beatbox featuring DJ Speedo.

524
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:34,020
and a song called Wookie Wookie by Jenny Rom

525
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:39,260
and then piano concerto number one in B flat minor

526
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:43,620
by Speedmaster. So it's like they're mixing that classical speed.

527
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:48,900
Speedmaster! And how can we forget Hostile Takeover, the before the beat mix?

528
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:52,420
Gotta love that one. And then of course

529
00:47:52,420 --> 00:47:56,540
this has got to be the coolest thing that's on there. Theme from Miami Vice

530
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:02,060
by the extra terror sound. That's cool. But it's a speed version, so I don't know what to expect from that.

531
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:05,860
So, also smoke on the water,

532
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:09,940
that's worth mentioning. Uh, you guys will want to check out the full song list. It is posted to our

533
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:13,300
website, www.orangelaunchradio.com.

534
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:17,220
But you know what's even cooler? What? You know what else is coming out soon? What?

535
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:21,220
Air Wolf Season 1 on DVD. Really?

536
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:26,360
Really. Interesting. And you know what? Dance Mania Speed G4 doesn't have the

537
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:34,560
airwolf has a fucking kick-ass helicopter that's for sure now that I've

538
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:39,200
successfully helicopter yeah but you don't have a cool helicopter like this

539
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:52,360
is like thunder in paradise but in the air and without you know Hulk Hogan and

540
00:48:52,360 --> 00:48:56,520
And what were you doing with it? It was just my normal car. Oh, okay.

541
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:03,520
I dreamed that I just drove it to work. So you were in, I don't know, Cruisin' World?

542
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:07,600
I think it was Cruisin' World, wasn't it, that had the Humvee?

543
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:14,600
That was cool. I used to always use the, the, the, um, the three-wheeled truck.

544
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:20,720
Alright, other Bahmani news, let's move on.

545
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,820
School Bus!

546
00:49:23,820 --> 00:49:26,240
You know DDR Freak, you ever heard of that website?

547
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:27,240
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

548
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,240
Were they?

549
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:32,940
You know, it's a site, and you know they actually syndicate our program on Friday nights over

550
00:49:32,940 --> 00:49:33,940
on DDR Freak Radio.

551
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:34,940
Really?

552
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:35,940
So maybe you've heard of it.

553
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:36,940
Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it.

554
00:49:36,940 --> 00:49:37,940
They check them out some day.

555
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:38,940
Yeah, we should.

556
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:47,380
ddrfreak.com turned five years old this week. Five years old. How old does that make you

557
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:51,900
feel? Because I remember when DDRFreak did not look like it did today. It was like, and

558
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:54,180
it didn't even have like the same address and everything. It's crazy.

559
00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:00,100
I remember it being green. And did it have the same, you know, bad grammar

560
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:06,220
that we've learned to come and love? Oh indeed. I remember, I remember having the

561
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:10,400
the biggest post count back in the day.

562
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,400
What happened with that?

563
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:12,400
Why is it that you had the biggest post count?

564
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:15,120
Because I don't really post that much.

565
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:17,220
I just watch threads now.

566
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:18,220
That's all I do.

567
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:20,320
Okay, this is stupid.

568
00:50:20,320 --> 00:50:21,320
No flames here.

569
00:50:21,320 --> 00:50:22,320
Moving on.

570
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,320
Nothing to see here.

571
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,500
You can't lock, well you can't lock a thread for being too stupid, but it has to be pointlessly

572
00:50:28,500 --> 00:50:30,300
stupid.

573
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:34,460
So I thought maybe we could go around and kind of talk about the first time we visited

574
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:41,580
DDR Freak and what we thought of it. Loki. I read, this is a tribute, by the way, to

575
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:50,220
DDR Freak Turning 5. I read the, um, what was it? DDR USA, the manual, and in the back

576
00:50:50,220 --> 00:50:56,000
there was a special thanks to ddrfreak.com. That's how I first found the website. To which

577
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:03,060
then I first found the regional forums, in which I found the link to Sac-Bomani. All

578
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,780
All links to the DDR USA manual. Yes, there are people that actually read that. Yes, I

579
00:51:06,780 --> 00:51:10,020
was that poor. I was gonna say, that's like tiny ass print

580
00:51:10,020 --> 00:51:14,180
in the back of the manual there. I was that bored.

581
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:18,140
So on your first visit to DDR Freak, you learned about the locals here, so that's cool.

582
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:21,620
Yep. Alright. Dark Sakhra, your first visit to DDR

583
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:25,740
Freak. This had to have been... it was right before

584
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:34,920
A.X. 2000. So, I should write around the time of A.X. 2000, because I was just getting into

585
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:39,020
a lot of it. I was looking for more people who play, and I just started posting there,

586
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:44,880
found people who had other interests, and then I randomly made the Sacramento thread

587
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:52,660
on DVR Freak. And, oh my god, did we get yelled at in that thread, because we were random.

588
00:51:52,660 --> 00:51:57,420
And I will, I'll tell you what, it was nothing compared to the random chat you see today

589
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:58,420
on DDR Free.

590
00:51:58,420 --> 00:52:02,580
But man, people were like, you guys are losers, right?

591
00:52:02,580 --> 00:52:03,580
You know what?

592
00:52:03,580 --> 00:52:04,580
They didn't want to see it.

593
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:06,580
They didn't have to click that thread.

594
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,580
Amen.

595
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:12,100
How'd you end up becoming a moderator over there?

596
00:52:12,100 --> 00:52:14,360
Because I was a good babysitter.

597
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:18,020
I had this habit of insinuating myself between people's arguments just because I didn't want

598
00:52:18,020 --> 00:52:19,660
to see all the crap.

599
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:20,660
And I posted so much.

600
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:21,660
I was available.

601
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,340
when I was working at GNC.

602
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:27,580
I was available all the time and posted all the time

603
00:52:27,580 --> 00:52:31,800
and had pretty good people skills so I got offered the position.

604
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:36,640
Right as my cable went down.

605
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:37,960
But it was pretty cool.

606
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:39,840
I still like doing it. I kinda

607
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:46,600
got really busy with stuff for a while and then I'm back in it now.

608
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:50,280
I'm trying to remember my first visit to DDR Freak. I don't remember about when it was. I think it was

609
00:52:50,280 --> 00:52:54,440
about the time I discovered the machine at RVGL I think I'd done a search on the

610
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:58,880
internet for DDR and I found DDR Freak that way and I do remember the boards

611
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:02,040
were green and I remember a lot of people that were posting were all in the

612
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:05,440
Bay Area and they were talking about the songs they were playing and passing in

613
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:09,680
the freestyle stuff and I was just kind of like these guys are sick obsessive

614
00:53:09,680 --> 00:53:15,840
little freaks which is really funny in retrospect that I thought that but then

615
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:22,240
I lurked for a long time. I lurked for probably a good two months. I remember

616
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:27,020
when I was lurking they were not using a PHP board, they were using some other

617
00:53:27,020 --> 00:53:30,900
type of web board when I first was looking at it. I was lurking at it and

618
00:53:30,900 --> 00:53:34,360
then when they did the PHP board I think that's when I finally signed up. But it's

619
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:37,580
not the same one that we know now. Like there was another, like there was another

620
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,000
board in between I don't even remember, but that's when I signed up and stopped

621
00:53:41,000 --> 00:53:44,040
lurking and it was probably about the same time as that sacramentals thread

622
00:53:44,040 --> 00:53:48,760
because I remember us all taking that trip to the Bay Area to play Para Para

623
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:54,660
for the first time. That was pretty awesome. So that was my first DDR Freak

624
00:53:54,660 --> 00:54:01,120
experience. Angel, do you remember? Yeah, unfortunately I was the late bloomer out

625
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:07,160
of all of you guys, but that's okay. Actually I'll blame it on Orange Lounge.

626
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:13,040
Probably around 2002 or so, so you know like I said I was a late bloomer out of all of

627
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:19,280
you guys, but it's pretty cool. I still... I don't do the forums, you know, as far as

628
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,560
posting is concerned, because someone took my name, so, you know, and I can't

629
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:29,400
think of anything else that's cool, so, you know, because my handle's my handle, so I

630
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:36,960
just, you know, look and read stuff, but other than that, no.

631
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:42,640
All right, so happy birthday to you folks there at DDR Freak. You're turning five

632
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,440
years old now you all can be placed in kindergarten so maybe you'll learn

633
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:54,480
something all right but man that just kind of shows how long DDR itself has

634
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:59,100
been around it's kind of interesting so it's very interesting to to go to DDR

635
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:02,380
freak and look at the headlines and they're all about in the groove kind of

636
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:09,840
shows you where this this thing is going very interesting all right let's take

637
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:13,100
another quick break and when we come back from this break we're gonna get in

638
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,960
the orange entre deux cage match maybe we'll do ourselves a list list tonight

639
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:18,500
we haven't done one of those in a while and I have a good idea for a topic so

640
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:23,140
we'll do that and we'll also open up the skype line for those you guys that want

641
00:55:23,140 --> 00:55:27,420
to call in so in this break you get some Bamani potpourri there's really no rhyme

642
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,220
or reason to why we're playing these songs we just want to hear them so we'll

643
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:37,220
We'll be back after this.

644
00:56:00,220 --> 00:56:02,220
Hey

645
00:57:00,220 --> 00:57:07,220
1, 2, 3, 4!

646
00:57:30,220 --> 00:57:52,220
I'm gonna be a, I'm gonna be a, I'm gonna be a faggot

647
00:57:52,220 --> 00:57:58,220
This is the end of the video, thank you so much for watching, and I'll see you in the next one.

648
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:40,220
Get up stand up, touch up on the plumb back

649
00:58:40,220 --> 00:58:43,220
How you gonna be the attraction?

650
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:47,220
An instruction if you wanna stay to the wall

651
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,220
Grab yourself a piece of the action

652
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,720
You got to get out the level, make the big fail

653
00:58:52,720 --> 00:58:54,720
Get out, you know we got to go

654
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,220
Get out the rock, dancing on top of the moon

655
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:58,220
Here we go, here we go

656
00:58:58,220 --> 00:59:01,720
Get up, stand up, stretch your focus up your nose

657
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,720
Get up, stand up

658
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:07,720
Plus it's you and her in a corner

659
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:12,220
Sitting by yourself in the dark

660
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:15,220
You don't really wanna be your mama

661
01:00:45,220 --> 01:01:14,060

677
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:19,820
chat. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey Sky, Siggy here. Hello Siggy, how are you?

678
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:25,260
I don't feel asleep. I just woke up. So you fell asleep and you missed the first part of Orange

679
01:02:25,260 --> 01:02:30,940
Lawn's radio? Well, just only, you know, just the first 30 minutes. That's all right. You know about

680
01:02:30,940 --> 01:02:37,980
the best thing that you missed so far? What? Oh, I didn't miss that, really.

681
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:46,180
I didn't miss that oh sorry I didn't miss that okay well then I guess I guess

682
01:02:46,180 --> 01:02:49,340
you really didn't miss anything that good then hey I'm actually kind of glad

683
01:02:49,340 --> 01:02:52,340
you called in I don't know what you called in to talk about but I got a

684
01:02:52,340 --> 01:02:56,340
question for you anything new on night style any new news going on there cuz

685
01:02:56,340 --> 01:02:59,980
I'm actually excited about I was about to say that actually hooray we're like

686
01:02:59,980 --> 01:03:05,420
minded as of today ooh yeah there's been you know there was a

687
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:13,920
Tokyo Demo held yesterday in Japan, and this is what they've said so far about, you know, a demo of the night style.

688
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:14,420
Ooh!

689
01:03:14,420 --> 01:03:23,920
Yeah, there was no revival song information was revealed because, you know, the demo only had 32 songs, and no old songs were revealed.

690
01:03:23,920 --> 01:03:26,420
Interesting, so they're trying to keep things secret then.

691
01:03:26,420 --> 01:03:27,420
Mm-hmm.

692
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:30,420
Did any word get out about the timing?

693
01:03:30,420 --> 01:03:37,820
Because you remember, when Nightstar came out in the arcades, people bitched about the timing issues in it, so I'm wondering how that's going to affect the home version.

694
01:03:37,820 --> 01:03:45,620
Well, according to people who went there, the timing seems to be fine, though a few people have mentioned that it seems tighter than previous versions.

695
01:03:45,620 --> 01:03:53,620
Whether it was just due to the environment, you know, like the controller, TV positioning, etc., or was an actual timing difference is unknown.

696
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:59,420
Interesting, yeah, that's true, because if you're playing it at a loud expo, it's probably going to be hard to nail the timing like you usually do.

697
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:04,420
Um, interesting though. Hey, I'd be okay with that if they were tightening up the timing windows a little bit, but just...

698
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:11,420
You know how Night Style and the Arcade had this whole different feel to it, probably because of, you know, rumors that they had changed some hardware and things like that.

699
01:04:11,420 --> 01:04:16,420
Um, you know. Interesting. Anything else that's going on with Night Style that you know of?

700
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,420
Um, Random Plus is set to be there.

701
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:20,420
Uh-huh.

702
01:04:20,420 --> 01:04:24,420
Uh, High Speed Force is there, so if anybody's worried.

703
01:04:24,420 --> 01:04:31,420
Very interesting that we don't know any of the consumer songs yet, considering we're only about, what, two weeks away from release?

704
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:35,420
We don't really know a whole lot about those consumer tracks, hopefully.

705
01:04:35,420 --> 01:04:41,420
Speaking of consumer tracks, there are five CS exclusive songs that have been released.

706
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:49,420
Here they are, the genre, and I'll mention the genre, the song, and the artist.

707
01:04:49,420 --> 01:04:50,420
Oh, so these are for Nightstyle?

708
01:04:50,420 --> 01:04:51,420
Yeah.

709
01:04:51,420 --> 01:04:52,420
Oh, cool, okay.

710
01:04:52,420 --> 01:04:56,980
The genre here is Dance Pop, and it's a Usual Days remix by OTA-2.

711
01:04:56,980 --> 01:05:02,020
It's four-star on Light Seven, seven-star on Seven Keys.

712
01:05:02,020 --> 01:05:07,580
And then Ragged Jungle, five p.m. Eternal by Garuvi, featuring No-Chien.

713
01:05:07,580 --> 01:05:12,180
Five-star on Light Seven, Flashing Seven on Seven Keys.

714
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:16,380
Is that LED in Garuvi, or just Garuvi? Just Garuvi. Interesting, okay.

715
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:21,020
And then the genre is Discotek, 80s capsule by Megumi Upper Slope.

716
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,900
three star on light seven, four star on seven keys.

717
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:26,940
Okay. Club Jazz,

718
01:05:26,940 --> 01:05:31,540
Paramnesia by Ushiroda Shinji, four star on light seven,

719
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:34,980
six star on seven keys. Alright. And then the fifth song,

720
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:39,340
which, you know, uh, uh, genre is drum and bass, Photogenic

721
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:43,420
by L.E.D. featuring, uh, Horisawa Michael.

722
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:48,340
Six star on light seven, seven star on seven keys. Those are the only five songs

723
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,380
that have been

724
01:05:49,380 --> 01:05:52,720
announced so far. So there are two more, which is our...

725
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,300
That's more than I knew about already, so that's cool. So that's good the LED's gonna

726
01:05:56,300 --> 01:06:00,140
have one in there, so I, cause I always like his stuff. Even though it all kinda sounds

727
01:06:00,140 --> 01:06:02,460
similar, I'm excited to see that's gonna be there.

728
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:06,480
Let me, let me send you this, this link on the website, which is actually a screenshot

729
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:10,840
of the menu, the menu select interface of 2DX Night Style.

730
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:15,920
Oh, very cool. So that's you posting in the chatroom there as Darkland XBI, for those

731
01:06:15,920 --> 01:06:21,380
just click on that link. Alright, very cool. Let me, I'm pulling it up here on my end here

732
01:06:21,380 --> 01:06:27,380
on the computer. Ah, okay. Okay. That looks, okay, it pretty much looks like the arcade

733
01:06:27,380 --> 01:06:31,580
did a little bit, a little bit condensed down, but I like that. It's a good look. I always,

734
01:06:31,580 --> 01:06:35,740
I like, I just like 9th Style a whole bunch. So, I, it's gonna, it's gonna be the one that

735
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:39,540
gets me back into 2DX. And I know I said that about 7th and 8th, and it didn't work, but

736
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:43,960
9th Style will be the one. It will. Yeah. And just, in case you notice on the picture

737
01:06:43,960 --> 01:06:49,740
that there are clear lamps are in there you know that like the colored markers

738
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:55,960
like like you go yeah you got this song finished screen good later or not right

739
01:06:55,960 --> 01:07:00,740
on all right anything else oh yeah wait on

740
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:05,340
nine style cs that for those who have played it quasar was supposed to have

741
01:07:05,340 --> 01:07:10,940
the 10 style video in it oh cool all right right on because you know how

742
01:07:10,940 --> 01:07:13,940
Now Quasar didn't really have, like it had a generic video in that style, but that doesn't really work.

743
01:07:13,940 --> 01:07:15,940
Yeah, it's a generic video from the background.

744
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:17,940
Oh good, I hope they do give a 10th style video.

745
01:07:17,940 --> 01:07:25,940
I hope that we get a 10th style or a red song in there that crosses over as well. That'd be kind of nice, but I guess we don't know anything yet, huh?

746
01:07:25,940 --> 01:07:34,940
No, so, yeah, they still have the folder sorting, you know, like by folders, like by letter, by the level of the difficulty of the song.

747
01:07:34,940 --> 01:07:35,940
Right.

748
01:07:35,940 --> 01:07:38,940
They have it, or supposedly have it, in there.

749
01:07:38,940 --> 01:07:46,940
Cool. Well, I'm sure the next two weeks will be busy two weeks for Night Style News, so hopefully we'll have more stuff next week and the week after, of course.

750
01:07:46,940 --> 01:07:48,940
Thank you, as always, for the update, Siggy.

751
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,940
Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

752
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,940
Well, nothing much to say.

753
01:07:52,940 --> 01:07:56,940
Alright. Fair enough. Well, thanks for calling in and giving us this update.

754
01:07:56,940 --> 01:07:57,940
Alright.

755
01:07:57,940 --> 01:07:58,940
Have a good one.

756
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,940
Later.

757
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:00,940
Later.

758
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,940
Alright, let's go. Wow, a bunch of people hammering us trying to get in tonight, so we'll just kind of take the calls as we see them.

759
01:08:05,940 --> 01:08:07,940
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

760
01:08:07,940 --> 01:08:09,280
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet.

761
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:10,480
Hello, my friend.

762
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:11,480
How are you?

763
01:08:11,480 --> 01:08:12,320
I'm doing good.

764
01:08:12,320 --> 01:08:13,160
How about yourself?

765
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:14,040
I'm pretty good.

766
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,520
I'm actually kind of glad you called in.

767
01:08:16,520 --> 01:08:17,040
Really?

768
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:17,600
Yes.

769
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:20,320
I have a bone to pick with Inside Pulse.

770
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:21,980
Oh, now what?

771
01:08:21,980 --> 01:08:24,840
I was reading the review of Tekken 5 over there.

772
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:26,440
Oh, for crying out loud.

773
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:27,800
Not this.

774
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,800
And the guy was totally dogging on the music.

775
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:34,280
And I'm like, oh my gosh, Tekken 5 has great music in it,

776
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:35,880
I think.

777
01:08:35,880 --> 01:08:37,840
But that would be his opinion.

778
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:44,400
I know, I know it wasn't you, but since, you know, you're the closest thing I have to being

779
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,120
able to yell at Inside Pulse, I'm yelling at you.

780
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:48,800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

781
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:54,400
Well there always is the link to the, the email link to the person who wrote the review.

782
01:08:54,400 --> 01:08:57,640
I'm sure he would like another flame to add to his collection.

783
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:00,600
I don't want to flame this guy via email.

784
01:09:00,600 --> 01:09:03,280
I'd rather he call in so I can yell at him in person.

785
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:04,280
No.

786
01:09:04,280 --> 01:09:05,280
That's alright.

787
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:09,560
supposed to say when you argue about somebody with music. Arguing with people about music

788
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:13,680
is something I never understood because it's like, this song sucks. No it doesn't. Yes

789
01:09:13,680 --> 01:09:19,200
it does. No it doesn't. I mean, what can you, how can you say, you know, people's perception

790
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:24,600
of music is totally and purely opinion, really. You know, it sounds good to me, it may not

791
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:26,000
sound good to you. You know, that's just the way it is.

792
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:30,300
Yeah, I completely agree with you there, Sky. It's like, but if we don't have arguments

793
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,340
about music, we wouldn't have any song pack discussion.

794
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,020
But one thing we can all agree on is that Forever Sunshine sucks balls.

795
01:09:37,020 --> 01:09:39,300
No, I can't agree with you there.

796
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:42,700
I cannot agree with you that it sucks balls.

797
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:47,220
I can tolerate it and enjoy it when I'm in the right mood.

798
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:51,580
I will take Forever Sunshine on this song pack.

799
01:09:51,580 --> 01:09:58,140
I don't hate it, hate it, want to die like a few songs on Bimani songs that I know of.

800
01:09:58,140 --> 01:10:01,180
Seagurd brainwashed you, that's what there is to it.

801
01:10:01,180 --> 01:10:08,180
No, I decently liked Forever Sunshine Long Before Home, alright.

802
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:11,180
Well, there was a thought in there, I just figured it out.

803
01:10:11,180 --> 01:10:15,180
You know what song would be great in an Ultramax song pack, now that I think about it?

804
01:10:20,180 --> 01:10:25,180
That needs to be played on every episode of Orange Lounge from here to eternity.

805
01:10:25,180 --> 01:10:28,180
It's gonna be the new inside joke, just wait. It's gonna be the new cake pie.

806
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:33,640
just just wait anyway so to what do we owe the guy I got you sidetracked there

807
01:10:33,640 --> 01:10:36,420
because I wanted to yell at you but to to what do we owe this call tonight I'm

808
01:10:36,420 --> 01:10:41,860
all it well we owe this call to well song pack discussion okay and it just

809
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:47,300
very interesting to see everybody's dog and forever sunshine whether you like it

810
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:51,100
or not mm-hmm everyone's dog in it and it's like oh now this song packs going

811
01:10:51,100 --> 01:10:54,860
to suck because forever Sun shines in it and I'm like okay well a song pack

812
01:10:54,860 --> 01:11:00,860
The song pack doesn't suck if one bad song is in it, because one good song can make a song pack very good, too.

813
01:11:00,860 --> 01:11:08,860
Exactly, and that's what I'm trying to get across. There are people out there who have labeled this song pack as bad thanks to one song.

814
01:11:08,860 --> 01:11:11,860
Worst song pack ever!

815
01:11:11,860 --> 01:11:17,860
Yes, people labeled song pack 3 bad because as soon as they heard Dynamite Rave was going to be on it before it was even released,

816
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:23,860
Oh no, it's Dynamite Rave! Everyone's played it already! Go away!

817
01:11:23,860 --> 01:11:27,420
that's true and I was one of those people but at the same time there were

818
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:28,260
things on

819
01:11:28,260 --> 01:11:31,540
song pack 3 that I was looking forward to and to be honest it's not a big

820
01:11:31,540 --> 01:11:33,300
surprise either like you know

821
01:11:33,300 --> 01:11:36,300
way back in the day when USA mix was all there was

822
01:11:36,300 --> 01:11:40,020
dark sakura you remember this how many people would play dynamite rave

823
01:11:40,020 --> 01:11:43,940
at golf land? everyone. exactly exactly

824
01:11:43,940 --> 01:11:48,260
but I'm personally looking forward to this song pack I'm definitely looking

825
01:11:48,260 --> 01:11:49,100
forward to

826
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:53,020
the new songs jelly kiss most definitely I had

827
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:57,780
put together a list a long, long, long time ago that I never released to anybody of what

828
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:02,780
songs I'd like to see on song packs. I put down 19 November, that ended up being on the

829
01:12:02,780 --> 01:12:06,300
mix, and Jelly Kiss was the only one so far that actually made it.

830
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:09,420
You got a Santa thing going on there? Or Sona? Sona?

831
01:12:09,420 --> 01:12:12,420
I like Sona. Sona's a good group.

832
01:12:12,420 --> 01:12:17,380
I totally just did the white boy pronunciation. Santa? Anyway.

833
01:12:17,380 --> 01:12:18,380
Santa.

834
01:12:18,380 --> 01:12:22,380
That Santa Moleste song, what is that about?

835
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:26,380
That's pervy.

836
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:30,380
Well that's pervy, just wait until Jelly Kiss comes out.

837
01:12:30,380 --> 01:12:34,380
I'm just glad that

838
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:38,380
Ultramix 2 kind of lives on this way through these song packs still coming out.

839
01:12:38,380 --> 01:12:42,380
Although I am a little upset that it took so darn long to start getting these song packs to roll

840
01:12:42,380 --> 01:12:46,380
out regularly because there was that hold up with the whole Canadian thing. I'm glad to see

841
01:12:46,380 --> 01:12:50,660
the song packs coming and keeping you know Ultramix 2 going. Yeah that's fine I

842
01:12:50,660 --> 01:12:54,460
mean it was all Microsoft's fault here and as soon as SP8 came out I'm sure

843
01:12:54,460 --> 01:12:59,620
people were dancing in the streets well if they were well dancing enough to do

844
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:03,900
so. Yeah you know I was actually playing Ultramix 2 online today it was kind of

845
01:13:03,900 --> 01:13:08,420
interesting I got I was actually playing another Xbox game and I got an invite

846
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:13,780
over to Ultramix 2 from somebody who is I think she is the number one Ultramix

847
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:18,780
player, and she's like in the top five of UltraMix 2. And she's really, really good.

848
01:13:18,780 --> 01:13:23,320
So she sent me a challenge thing, because, you know, we have fun when we play on there.

849
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:28,020
So I actually played against her, and it was cool, we were just going down the list alphabetically.

850
01:13:28,020 --> 01:13:30,540
And it was just, you know, we were just going down the list alphabetically, and there's

851
01:13:30,540 --> 01:13:35,260
so many good songs in UltraMix 2. It's just, ugh. I do love that mix, I wish I'd played

852
01:13:35,260 --> 01:13:39,900
it more. It makes me excited for UltraMix 3. And I know nothing official has been announced

853
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:45,020
with Ultramix 3, but come on. There's gotta be an Ultramix 3. You know what else, speaking

854
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:49,940
of Ultramix, I was actually at Best Buy yesterday, and I was looking for a new game to pick up,

855
01:13:49,940 --> 01:13:54,780
and I noticed that DDR Ultramix was in Xbox Platinum Hits now. So you can...

856
01:13:54,780 --> 01:13:58,180
Oh really? Yeah, I saw that the other day. I didn't even realize that. Like, that totally

857
01:13:58,180 --> 01:14:03,500
came out of nowhere. So, has that been that way for a long time? I think it's more recent.

858
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,980
Is it more recent? Well, just so you guys know, Ultramix is only 20 bucks now, because

859
01:14:06,980 --> 01:14:11,400
platinum hit so you can get the platinum hits cover too because the cover looks a

860
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:14,740
little different when your platinum hits the game so it's kind of neat to see so

861
01:14:14,740 --> 01:14:18,420
yeah so we can now say no matter what you think of the first UltraMix guess

862
01:14:18,420 --> 01:14:22,000
what it was successful enough that's right and UltraMix 2 is probably

863
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,640
destined for the platinum hits soon enough as well so that's pretty much one

864
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,660
can make it then UltraMix 2 should be platinum by the end of the year

865
01:14:28,660 --> 01:14:32,400
absolutely although you know it was interesting I've been um I've been

866
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:36,500
really into this website lately for video games it's one up calm I don't know

867
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:41,180
if you guys have heard of this, 1UP.com, because they have a lot of the, it's very fan-oriented

868
01:14:41,180 --> 01:14:44,420
where you can have your own blogger and you can have a club. We actually have an Orange

869
01:14:44,420 --> 01:14:48,860
Lounge Radio Club over on 1UP.com that Rice Princess started, so I'll have to put the

870
01:14:48,860 --> 01:14:51,900
link in the chatroom for that, for those of you guys who haven't seen that yet, the Orange

871
01:14:51,900 --> 01:14:57,960
Lounge Radio Club. There was, they also show how games are ranked, like you know, the ranking

872
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:03,980
for various games, and I was surprised because I have in every Xbox title that I own, and

873
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:07,860
And Ultramix 2 is like the lowest ranked one on the list and I was kind of like that's

874
01:15:07,860 --> 01:15:10,820
so sad because it's such a great game.

875
01:15:10,820 --> 01:15:13,100
It's really a gem of a title.

876
01:15:13,100 --> 01:15:18,240
It is but then again you know a place like that when fans come to congregate it's going

877
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:23,740
to be a lot of the casual fans and of course games like Halo and Gran Turismo and Grand

878
01:15:23,740 --> 01:15:27,180
Theft Auto and Metal Gear they're all going to be in the top rank.

879
01:15:27,180 --> 01:15:31,860
Well exactly if you look at the top 3 right now it's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Halo

880
01:15:31,860 --> 01:15:36,860
and The Legend of Zelda, the brand new one, because of that, you know, trailer that came out this week.

881
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,860
The Legend of Zelda shocked me, but, uh, I saw that, though, that was a very good trailer.

882
01:15:41,860 --> 01:15:45,860
Yeah, remember the trailer that came out this week? Oh my God, how many of you guys saw the Zelda trailer this week?

883
01:15:45,860 --> 01:15:47,860
I haven't yet.

884
01:15:47,860 --> 01:15:48,860
I'm gonna show it to you.

885
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:49,860
I've been too busy.

886
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:55,860
After the show tonight, I have to show it to you. It is, it will just make you tingle in places you didn't know could tingle.

887
01:15:55,860 --> 01:15:56,860
Ooh!

888
01:15:56,860 --> 01:16:02,860
Two words can describe the, uh, trailer. Holy and, uh, what's the other one? Yeah, crap. Holy crap.

889
01:16:02,860 --> 01:16:06,860
Or other various explicitives that you might be able to pick up.

890
01:16:06,860 --> 01:16:11,860
Oh, of course. Including, uh, the omission of bodily functions that I think I'll just stop there on.

891
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:12,860
What, Darkseeker?

892
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:15,860
Explicitives? Don't you mean explicitives?

893
01:16:15,860 --> 01:16:17,860
Yeah, explicitives.

894
01:16:17,860 --> 01:16:21,860
I'm going to add that to the dictionary of Rob.

895
01:16:21,860 --> 01:16:26,180
This is why I'm on internet radio, boys and girls, because, you know, these things...

896
01:16:26,180 --> 01:16:29,580
I can't get into real radio. I can never break into real radio because my

897
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:30,640
pronunciation probably...

898
01:16:30,640 --> 01:16:33,740
Yes, that was a new song by Britney Spears that was

899
01:16:33,740 --> 01:16:37,940
TOKESIC here on... Put the wrong emphasis on the wrong

900
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:44,180
syllables, guy. Need to work on that. Oh, well, I'm learning.

901
01:16:44,180 --> 01:16:47,340
Alright, anything else you want to share with us, El Mullet?

902
01:16:47,340 --> 01:16:50,820
Well, if you see a piece of

903
01:16:50,820 --> 01:16:54,140
a little down the line on in the groove on our site

904
01:16:54,140 --> 01:16:58,020
I'll be responsible for that who I can't wait to see that

905
01:16:58,020 --> 01:17:01,060
that's all I'm going to say on it knowing that you wrote it

906
01:17:01,060 --> 01:17:05,900
makes me very excited what it is and in what capacity I'm not liberty to say at

907
01:17:05,900 --> 01:17:06,400
this point

908
01:17:06,400 --> 01:17:09,460
all right all right sounds good

909
01:17:09,460 --> 01:17:12,660
I'll be looking for it. Talk to you later, Sky. Have a good one, Mullet.

910
01:17:12,660 --> 01:17:16,780
You too. Later. Alright, let's go to the next call. Gosh, we're just getting

911
01:17:16,780 --> 01:17:19,040
back-to-back-to-back calls tonight. I'm trying to get everyone in.

912
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:20,640
Hi, you're on Orange Longs Radio.

913
01:17:20,640 --> 01:17:23,240
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ronma from New York. How you guys doing?

914
01:17:23,240 --> 01:17:25,240
Good, Ronma from New York. How you doing?

915
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:28,640
I'm doing pretty good. Glad to hear you guys one more time.

916
01:17:28,640 --> 01:17:31,040
Yeah, it's good to have you calling in. What's on your mind tonight?

917
01:17:31,040 --> 01:17:35,240
Not much. I've been telling Dark Sakura for a while. I had a little surprise for her.

918
01:17:35,240 --> 01:17:36,440
Ooh.

919
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:39,640
I'm posting the links now in the chat room.

920
01:17:39,640 --> 01:17:42,840
Okay. I'm gonna bring them up on the computer over here.

921
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:45,840
Or do you have them on the... You can get them on your laptop over there, right, Dark Sakura?

922
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:46,840
Yeah, I'm looking.

923
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,680
Okay, I'm putting him in too because I want to see what it is.

924
01:17:48,680 --> 01:17:54,480
So DJ Aramayas posting this in our chat room over at orangeloungelaungeradio.com, clicking on chat, and...

925
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,320
Oh, is that a picture of you, buddy?

926
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,000
Yeah, and you're...

927
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,640
You're kicking an Ultracade machine!

928
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,480
Yes!

929
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:03,800
That's awesome!

930
01:18:03,800 --> 01:18:04,880
That is going to go in our...

931
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:08,480
If you don't mind, we want to put that in our Orange Lounge Radio photo gallery.

932
01:18:08,480 --> 01:18:09,680
Go right ahead!

933
01:18:09,680 --> 01:18:16,360
I think we need to start a photo gallery on orangelaungeradio.com of people kicking Ultracade machines.

934
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:21,360
I like that idea. We're going to do that, and we'll even set up an email where you can email your picks.

935
01:18:21,360 --> 01:18:22,360
That is awesome.

936
01:18:22,360 --> 01:18:25,360
And you'll be the first one in there, buddy. That's great.

937
01:18:25,360 --> 01:18:29,360
Ain't it fair, you have an Alpine Racer 2. I miss that game.

938
01:18:29,360 --> 01:18:33,360
Well, if you ever come to New York, I'll bring it to the arcade where you can play it.

939
01:18:33,360 --> 01:18:34,360
Sounds good.

940
01:18:34,360 --> 01:18:35,360
Would you have my plane ticket, please?

941
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:40,360
You know, actually that arcade reminds me of Miggle, kind of, for some reason. I don't know what it is.

942
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:47,360
Interesting. And there's another, oh! So there's a picture of him kicking the top, and a picture of him kicking the coin slot. Awesome.

943
01:18:47,360 --> 01:18:48,360
That is so nice.

944
01:18:48,360 --> 01:18:54,360
I was trying to go for a, um, a better kick, but manager came by, we just kinda hightailed out of there.

945
01:18:54,360 --> 01:19:04,360
Now, now, everybody out there, before I encourage you to run out there and kick all the Ultra Kade machines in the planet, be careful, okay?

946
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:08,360
Don't actually damage the machine because you can get in trouble for that.

947
01:19:08,360 --> 01:19:10,360
I don't want to get sued because somebody, you know,

948
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:13,360
we had recommended that you kick an UltraCade machine.

949
01:19:13,360 --> 01:19:16,360
If you get in trouble for kicking an UltraCade machine,

950
01:19:16,360 --> 01:19:21,360
I will say that I knew nothing about it, and we never told you to do anything.

951
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:23,360
So don't get in trouble.

952
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:25,360
There you go, you got the disclaimer up and running.

953
01:19:25,360 --> 01:19:28,360
Alright, sounds good. Anything else you wanted to share with us? That's great though.

954
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:33,360
One more thing, I went out and bought a Donald J. Trump doll Friday night.

955
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:41,360
Only in New York. What is this about? What made you decide to get a Donald J. Trump doll?

956
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:48,360
Well, me and my friends, we went out for dinner, and before we decided to play DDR, there's a big Toys R Us in Times Square.

957
01:19:48,360 --> 01:19:57,360
We went over, walked around, we found some great stuff. There's a picture in my gallery of Toys R Us misspelling Gundam with an H.

958
01:19:57,360 --> 01:20:01,360
Isn't that Toys R Us, the one that was in an episode of The Apprentice as well?

959
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:05,880
Yeah, I see okay. Okay, so it's a famous Toys R Us. Mm-hmm. All right

960
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,080
basically

961
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:12,960
We got dragged over to the barbie section. We're walking around one of the guys was like check this out

962
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:15,480
He picked up the doll. I was like I bought it

963
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:20,280
There's a picture of me in the gallery worshiping the doll because it was like the best thing in the barbie section

964
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:26,400
Wait, so they had the Donald Trump doll in the barbie section. Yes. What is that all about? That's very interesting

965
01:20:26,400 --> 01:20:27,680
I don't know.

966
01:20:27,680 --> 01:20:30,360
But it does say, it does have this one interesting quote.

967
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:31,560
Hope you guys can hear it.

968
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:32,060
OK.

969
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:36,480
No, I couldn't hear it.

970
01:20:36,480 --> 01:20:37,840
What was it saying?

971
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,320
I have no choice to tell you, but you're fired.

972
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:41,840
Beautiful.

973
01:20:41,840 --> 01:20:43,680
And to answer the question in chat room,

974
01:20:43,680 --> 01:20:45,720
that is Laser Park in New York City.

975
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:46,320
Oh, OK.

976
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:46,920
Very cool.

977
01:20:46,920 --> 01:20:47,720
Yeah.

978
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:48,280
All right.

979
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:49,960
Well, Rama, thank you very much for the pictures.

980
01:20:49,960 --> 01:20:52,080
And I think you've started a new trend here on Orange Lounge.

981
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:54,420
So we're going to get on that after tonight's show doing

982
01:20:54,420 --> 01:20:56,280
the Ultra-Cade Kicking Gallery.

983
01:20:56,280 --> 01:20:58,280
Oh, I'm here to help any way possible.

984
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:00,280
Alright, so get your friends to do it and take pictures of them.

985
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:02,280
I plan on it.

986
01:21:02,280 --> 01:21:04,280
Alright, sounds good.

987
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:05,280
Alright, cool.

988
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,280
Alright, have a good one buddy, we gotta get some more calls.

989
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,280
Alright, take care, bye.

990
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:09,280
Later!

991
01:21:09,280 --> 01:21:12,280
Alright, one more call you guys, then we're gonna get into the Orange Lawns Radio Cage Match.

992
01:21:12,280 --> 01:21:14,280
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio!

993
01:21:14,280 --> 01:21:16,280
Legend of Zaku.

994
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:20,280
Hello, Legend of Zaku. One New York call to another, what's on your mind buddy?

995
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:30,280
Well, a couple of things. One, let me see, a tournament I went to this weekend and just basically drama, drama, and damage and drama.

996
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,280
Oh boy, what tournament was this?

997
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:37,280
It was a local tournament in the Bronx, you know, where I'm from.

998
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:47,280
Apparently, the locals in the arcade there basically got pissed off at, you know, the people out, you know, the outside players for basically being good at them.

999
01:21:47,280 --> 01:21:50,080
I mean, beating the crap out of them in, you know, the tournament.

1000
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:56,080
And they got so childish that they brought like six or seven people that, you know, they were about to beat the shit out of them.

1001
01:21:56,080 --> 01:22:00,080
That's how bad, that's how hostile it was going to get.

1002
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:03,080
Well, you're breaking up a little bit there, buddy, but, but so...

1003
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:08,080
...posting up right now, you'll see the locked thread that, that resulted in this...

1004
01:22:08,080 --> 01:22:11,080
So, you're breaking up a little bit, but clarify this for me.

1005
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:16,080
...drama because, you know, they got, they, they, these people...

1006
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:19,080
I think he might be a little bit delayed here. So, so clarify this for me.

1007
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:25,080
Um, some folks beat some other folks up over DDR, is what you're saying.

1008
01:22:28,080 --> 01:22:29,080
I think he's delayed.

1009
01:22:29,080 --> 01:22:30,080
No, they were about to.

1010
01:22:30,080 --> 01:22:31,080
Oh, okay, okay.

1011
01:22:31,080 --> 01:22:35,080
Because, you know, these people, the people here...

1012
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:39,080
He's really breaking up there. You're really, really breaking up there, buddy.

1013
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:44,080
...that local particulars there, they take DDR too seriously.

1014
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:52,880
Yeah, I mean, you know what, DDR is nothing to want to even think about beating somebody

1015
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:53,880
up over.

1016
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:58,140
I mean, I would say that serving people over a DDR tournament, that's okay.

1017
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:01,120
You can serve people, but don't beat them up.

1018
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:06,480
Yes, but they take, the thing is that they took it seriously as they compared, they almost

1019
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:12,280
made it, you know, compared it as to like a sporting event where they were just basically,

1020
01:23:12,280 --> 01:23:17,200
distracting, embarrassing the other players, and not the regulars there.

1021
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,140
So it's kind of like, that's where the drama erupted from.

1022
01:23:20,140 --> 01:23:23,320
And you know, the regular good players had to like, you know, show them their plays by

1023
01:23:23,320 --> 01:23:26,060
basically showing off in order to show them how it felt like.

1024
01:23:26,060 --> 01:23:27,120
You know what, all I have to say...

1025
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,760
They basically ignored it, you know, in the past couple of tournaments there.

1026
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:35,120
All I have to say about these folks that want to cause all this drama over DDR, stop giving

1027
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:39,040
the rest of us a bad name, honestly, stop!

1028
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:40,420
Exactly.

1029
01:23:40,420 --> 01:23:46,980
As you can see the post from DDR Freak that I gave you, a sketch, you know, who's basically

1030
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:51,340
almost like a household name within the community because, you know, he's one of the best in

1031
01:23:51,340 --> 01:23:54,740
the city, if not the state or the east coast.

1032
01:23:54,740 --> 01:23:58,860
He was there in attendance yesterday and he pointed out, he basically, he told them politely

1033
01:23:58,860 --> 01:24:03,980
that he just, you know, he finds those people rude and, you know, and they basically went

1034
01:24:03,980 --> 01:24:08,820
on rampage by insulting his group, his group of people.

1035
01:24:08,820 --> 01:24:13,720
They insulted DPD in general, so, you know, it doesn't make sense because he was telling

1036
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:17,720
me this game was going to take a little bit longer than I thought it would be, but I'm

1037
01:24:17,720 --> 01:24:19,720
not sure if it's going to take a little bit longer than I thought it would be.

1038
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:23,360
My friend, you're breaking up over there, so I'm going to, Zaku, I know you're still

1039
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,100
trying to talk, but we can't understand you because you're breaking up, buddy.

1040
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,720
I'm going to have to go ahead and let you go, but we'll talk a little bit more about

1041
01:24:28,720 --> 01:24:30,000
this, so keep listening, Zaku.

1042
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,320
I appreciate the update on the tournament, okay bud?

1043
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:33,320
Have a good one.

1044
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:37,480
I feel bad that I had to let him go, but he was just breaking up really bad there.

1045
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:41,480
So, I don't know.

1046
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:44,320
Why would you want to do this?

1047
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:50,600
Obviously if you go to a DDR tournament, it is going to be an explicit, by the way, walked

1048
01:24:50,600 --> 01:24:54,440
in during that phone call, so he's kind of picked up most of that call, and he's run

1049
01:24:54,440 --> 01:24:57,000
a lot of tournaments and has had to deal with some of this drama.

1050
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:03,720
So I know you've got something you want to share on this, but if you go to a DDR tournament,

1051
01:25:03,720 --> 01:25:07,200
you should expect that there are going to be people there who are better than you.

1052
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,720
So why would you want to beat them up because they're better than you?

1053
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:15,920
Well, the thing is, I understand this is a human nature that people do not want to lose.

1054
01:25:15,920 --> 01:25:20,520
Or people are looking out over some other dude's girlfriend or so forth.

1055
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:28,160
It's a lot of nonsense, but I mean, I've been through numerous tournaments myself.

1056
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:31,080
Maybe like 18 tournaments so far total.

1057
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:35,280
And never have I seen anybody fight fiscally in a tournament.

1058
01:25:35,280 --> 01:25:40,360
But if this were true, I just tend to tell people that just grow up basically.

1059
01:25:40,360 --> 01:25:43,720
They didn't actually do the physical fight, I clarified that, they didn't actually get

1060
01:25:43,720 --> 01:25:44,720
into a fight.

1061
01:25:44,720 --> 01:25:45,720
Oh, okay.

1062
01:25:45,720 --> 01:25:46,720
But, you know, get in there.

1063
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:47,720
Get in there.

1064
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:48,720
I remember.

1065
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:51,320
Because I remember there was one time that I saw a fight over DER.

1066
01:25:51,320 --> 01:25:52,320
Oh my gosh!

1067
01:25:52,320 --> 01:25:55,640
That was the CCO, like, two years ago in July.

1068
01:25:55,640 --> 01:25:56,640
That is so lame.

1069
01:25:56,640 --> 01:25:58,680
That is so lame.

1070
01:25:58,680 --> 01:26:01,800
What were, what were, and what was, what was the honest reason?

1071
01:26:01,800 --> 01:26:05,400
Oh my god, you got one more perfect than me, you bastard!

1072
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:12,600
Oh, cause, well the thing is, at the time I was there, well the person who was playing

1073
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:18,600
like Demon Road got up to max unlimited, then some guy was just, you know, messing around

1074
01:26:18,600 --> 01:26:21,560
thinking it would be okay to screw his game up.

1075
01:26:21,560 --> 01:26:22,560
Gotcha.

1076
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:23,560
Yeah.

1077
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:28,360
Then, of course, the fight spilled coke over the DDR pads in the group, well now the in

1078
01:26:28,360 --> 01:26:29,360
the group pads.

1079
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:30,360
Right.

1080
01:26:30,360 --> 01:26:42,360
I set your ass on fire.

1081
01:26:42,360 --> 01:26:47,360
I set your ass on fire.

1082
01:26:47,360 --> 01:26:51,360
So it's, you can start drama if you want to die.

1083
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:55,360
That'd be cool. I need an excuse to set people on fire, you know.

1084
01:26:55,360 --> 01:27:00,400
well said you like the fire I know that all right we're gonna get into the

All right, that was a clip of song number one you can vote for tonight, Ayumi Hamasaki.

1107
01:30:24,660 --> 01:30:26,580
Song number two is Loki's pick.

1108
01:30:26,580 --> 01:30:27,980
Loki, what did you pick first tonight?

1109
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:35,980
Another song, it's a remix of Xenon. It's Xenon the halogen mix and it's done by T-Drop.

1110
01:30:35,980 --> 01:30:39,980
I found it has some like video game mix set or something.

1111
01:30:39,980 --> 01:30:46,980
Alright, so here it is, a remix of Xenon as song number two tonight in the cage match. Enjoy!

1112
01:34:09,980 --> 01:34:11,980
Oh

1113
01:35:09,980 --> 01:35:33,900
Alrighty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Beat Drop with Xenon, the halogen

1114
01:35:33,900 --> 01:35:34,900
mix.

1115
01:35:34,900 --> 01:35:38,420
And now we're going to go around in our really bad impersonation of American Idol and tell

1116
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:41,200
you guys what we thought of that although we're not the ones who get to

1117
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:45,460
choose it's you guys in the chat room dark Sakura it sounded like someone took

1118
01:35:45,460 --> 01:35:52,740
me on which is by itself a really good song and dropped it and beat it I didn't

1119
01:35:52,740 --> 01:35:58,300
like sampling at all sound like it was good done to a telephone or Gameboy

1120
01:35:59,500 --> 01:36:04,300
there were parts of it I thought were okay but honestly I just couldn't get

1121
01:36:04,300 --> 01:36:10,440
passage sounding like it was done through like a phonograph speaker

1122
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:18,680
underwater so it gets you to explicit well it's a pretty good song I mean

1123
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:21,760
there's something like dark Sakura said there's some parts I just don't feel

1124
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,920
would be necessary which is like I'll give it a six but since it's not a max

1125
01:36:26,920 --> 01:36:35,320
remix I give it I get it plus one point the seven angel it was okay I still like

1126
01:36:35,320 --> 01:36:38,340
the original better

1127
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:45,780
Loki it was my last-minute pick I had another pick which is also by beat drop

1128
01:36:45,780 --> 01:36:49,280
which is a remix of I don't even know what it was there's something from GI

1129
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:55,100
Joe's called mouth and it's really strange but it sounded cool and if he

1130
01:36:55,100 --> 01:37:00,660
only made it longer it'd be even off better but um so I don't know it was

1131
01:37:00,660 --> 01:37:06,140
just last-minute pick it sounded okay I mean I don't know I like beat drops stuff

1132
01:37:06,140 --> 01:37:14,220
so I give it a seven me hated it three oh but I'm gonna give it a bonus point

1133
01:37:14,220 --> 01:37:19,900
for not being a max remix as well so it gets a four all right let's get in my

1134
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:26,020
song tonight my song is actually an old ass song but they did like this new

1135
01:37:26,020 --> 01:37:30,500
remix of it last year so I'm gonna pick this song because the song was rad and I

1136
01:37:30,500 --> 01:37:33,060
kind of like this new remix like it really grew on me I've been listening to

1137
01:37:33,060 --> 01:37:38,180
it a lot of my car so and everybody out here knows this song it's a group called

1138
01:37:38,180 --> 01:37:47,060
Haddaway and the song is what is love this is what is love reloaded enjoy

1139
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:55,460

01:37:55,460 --> 01:37:59,460
oh baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

1141

Oh, baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

1142
01:38:13,460 --> 01:38:15,460
What is love?

1143
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:57,060
So I don't know why you're not there I give you my love but you don't care

1144
01:38:57,060 --> 01:39:04,060
So what is right and what is wrong Give me a sign, what is love?

1145
01:39:04,060 --> 01:39:06,060
Baby

1146
01:39:06,060 --> 01:39:16,060
Don't hurt me, no more Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1147
01:39:16,060 --> 01:39:18,060
What is love?

1148
01:39:18,060 --> 01:39:25,040
Woah, woah, woah, woah size

1149
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:30,740
Woah, woah, woah, woah size

1150
01:39:30,780 --> 01:39:31,940
What is love?

1151
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:52,820
Oh, I don't know what can I do What else can I say, it's up to you

1152
01:39:52,820 --> 01:39:59,980
I know what I want, just me and you I can't go on

1153
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:03,480
I want no other, no other lover

1154
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,480
This is our life, our time

1155
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:10,480
When we are together, I need you forever

1156
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,480
Is it love?

1157
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:18,980
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1158
01:40:18,980 --> 01:40:20,480
Want it love?

1159
01:40:20,480 --> 01:40:26,480
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1160
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:34,480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what, what, love, love, what is love?

1161
01:40:34,480 --> 01:40:41,480
What, what, what, love, love, what is love?

1162
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,920
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match,

1163
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:58,180
had away with what is love reloaded. Let's see what the folks in the room thought of

1164
01:40:58,180 --> 01:41:04,280
that one starting off with Dark Sakura. I'm sorry but even remixed that song still gets

1165
01:41:04,280 --> 01:41:10,440
on my nerves just because it was so damn overplayed. Where I would give the original a five that

1166
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:15,440
one was slightly better so I would give it a six and a half. Just cause I heard it way

1167
01:41:15,440 --> 01:41:22,440
too much. Explicit. Well I have to go with Dark Sakura. Yeah it's a little overplayed

1168
01:41:22,440 --> 01:41:26,840
And this remix, I don't know, it just sounds just the same as the original for some reason.

1169
01:41:26,840 --> 01:41:31,440
Like, not really much has been done, just because it has the reloaded sign into it.

1170
01:41:31,440 --> 01:41:34,440
Hmm, I'll give it a 6.8.

1171
01:41:34,440 --> 01:41:42,440
Uh, 6.8. Come on, give it an extra 0.1 so we can have a 6.9 explicit. What do you say?

1172
01:41:42,440 --> 01:41:45,440
I'll give it the 0.1.

1173
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,440
And what is this gonna have to do?

1174
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:50,440
It doesn't matter. Alright, Angel.

1175
01:41:50,440 --> 01:41:56,440
I liked it, um, you know, because it's 80s and stuff, I don't know.

1176
01:41:56,440 --> 01:41:59,440
Kinda had an extra little beat to it, um...

1177
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:02,440
God, this mic is loud, okay!

1178
01:42:02,440 --> 01:42:06,440
It needed to be loud, though. We've been doing some sound balancing, so that...

1179
01:42:06,440 --> 01:42:09,440
Because we've been getting some mail on the podcast going,

1180
01:42:09,440 --> 01:42:12,440
It's... your sound is so messed up, ah!

1181
01:42:12,440 --> 01:42:14,440
It's kinda bad when I can hear it from over there.

1182
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:16,440
Hey, no, that's a good thing. I think it's a good thing.

1183
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:18,440
Alright, like I said, 8.

1184
01:42:18,440 --> 01:42:37,440
I love the original, however this sucked. A stronger bass drum and a stronger synth line is not a remix, it's just crap. It's the same damn song all over again.

1185
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:43,440
I love the original and they fucked it up. They went and made it into a hardhouse track and it's not supposed to be.

1186
01:42:43,440 --> 01:42:50,900
It lost everything that I liked about the original and just sounds like a really shitty cover of it. So it gets a four

1187
01:42:53,460 --> 01:42:58,900
You know what I kind of like it because that song's been kind of gone for a little while now that night at the Roxbury

1188
01:42:58,900 --> 01:43:00,660
Is not starting out live anymore

1189
01:43:00,660 --> 01:43:04,020
You know, so I kind of think it was time for that song to come back

1190
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:07,540
And what I really like about that remix is that it's under three minutes

1191
01:43:07,620 --> 01:43:12,980
So whilst the beat in the background is a little repetitive the song knows when to quit so I kind of like that

1192
01:43:12,980 --> 01:43:18,140
that so I like that song so I will give it an eight all right but however

1193
01:43:18,140 --> 01:43:22,800
remember it is not up to us it's up to you guys you guys get the final say so

1194
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:26,180

1205
01:44:17,700 --> 01:44:23,380
What I've been plugging a little bit tonight, I'm going to post it one more time in the

1206
01:44:23,380 --> 01:44:27,260
chat room for those of you guys that haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'm posting

1207
01:44:27,260 --> 01:44:32,660
a link to our LiveJournal community and it's actually a post in that LiveJournal community

1208
01:44:32,660 --> 01:44:35,700
and you do not have to be a member of the community to read it, you don't even have

1209
01:44:35,700 --> 01:44:39,540
to be a LiveJournal member, just go ahead and click on that link because what is in

1210
01:44:39,540 --> 01:44:45,900
that is instructions on how to vote for us in the Best of Live 365 competition that's

1211
01:44:45,900 --> 01:44:50,340
going on right now, how to get us nominated. And I know what some of you guys are thinking.

1212
01:44:50,340 --> 01:44:54,580
Why does Orange Alliance Radio want to get nominated for one of those silly award shows?

1213
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:59,540
Well, because we like attention, duh. I mean, is there, I mean, Dark Sakura, can you disagree

1214
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,060
with me there? Attention's great.

1215
01:45:02,060 --> 01:45:03,500
We are whores for attention.

1216
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:04,500
Yeah, absolutely.

1217
01:45:04,500 --> 01:45:07,020
We will totally just make utter sluts of ourselves for attention.

1218
01:45:07,020 --> 01:45:11,220
Where is the link right there for the podcast alley vote thing?

1219
01:45:11,220 --> 01:45:14,300
Oh yes, we'll post that as well. I'll post that a little later. I want people to do this

1220
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:17,580
first but we'll do the podcast alley thing later because we're trying to get

1221
01:45:17,580 --> 01:45:23,860
our podcast voted up too and we rely on you guys the OL Army to help us get the

1222
01:45:23,860 --> 01:45:28,940
attention we so deserve and in turn we continue to do this train wreck of a

1223
01:45:28,940 --> 01:45:33,860
show for you guys no we do appreciate the help you guys we love it actually a

1224
01:45:33,860 --> 01:45:37,420
big thing is that we just we want to go back to the award show this year we just

1225
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:41,100
kind of want to I think really in doing this because you have to remember there

1226
01:45:41,100 --> 01:45:46,280
there is all sorts of stations on Live 365. There's what, like 60,000? It's incredible,

1227
01:45:46,280 --> 01:45:53,720
the amount of stations that are on Live 365. And for a DDR talk video game music station

1228
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:58,200
to get nominated, that's really cool. And I think it shows that there is an audience

1229
01:45:58,200 --> 01:46:04,080
for this type of video game programming, where we're not talking about Madden, we're talking

1230
01:46:04,080 --> 01:46:08,800
about Halo all the time. You know, we're talking about other video games. And you're gonna

1231
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:12,480
kind of notice that as, you know, the year goes on and Orange Lounge kind of slowly

1232
01:46:12,480 --> 01:46:18,400
does this shift from just being a Bamani to Bamani and more. We just kind of want

1233
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:22,120
to show that there is a demand out there for this kind of niche. Speaking of

1234
01:46:22,120 --> 01:46:26,320
strictly, if you want to talk a strictly Bamani based radio station, our buddies

1235
01:46:26,320 --> 01:46:28,960
over at DDR Freak, we're trying to help them out get a nomination as well.

1236
01:46:28,960 --> 01:46:32,280
They've been really good to us this year, especially with the whole syndication

1237
01:46:32,280 --> 01:46:35,640
everything, so we'd like to see them get a nod as well. So that is all detailed

1238
01:46:35,640 --> 01:46:39,720
for you guys in the LiveJournal post. Also, our grandfather's station, Understation Live,

1239
01:46:39,720 --> 01:46:44,040
we're trying to get them a nod as well. Without Understation Live, we would not be here. I

1240
01:46:44,040 --> 01:46:49,960
do not think so. All of that. So I hope you guys will consider taking a second. It's free.

1241
01:46:49,960 --> 01:46:53,600
You guys already have to have a Live365 account to listen to this show, so you've already

1242
01:46:53,600 --> 01:46:57,940
got everything you need. So check that out. Those of you guys that are too shy to join

1243
01:46:57,940 --> 01:47:02,720
our chat room, just go to our LiveJournal community. It's www.livejournal.com slash

1247
01:47:13,360 --> 01:47:19,640
support um okay so that's that let's talk about a little bit of sim scene

1248
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:23,200
news and usually this is kind of bit a joke lately what with all the sites

1249
01:47:23,200 --> 01:47:25,760
being down but I know Loki I know there's big news you're very excited

1250
01:47:25,760 --> 01:47:28,640
about this week so you got to tell us about this in the sim scene update I

1251
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:37,640
I guess. Um, anyways, um, just like a lot of fan stuff out there that's being worked on, most of the stuff, of course, you'll always find is in Japan.

1252
01:47:37,640 --> 01:47:44,640
And you really need to, like, watch the Japanese sites, because that's where all the stuff's happening nowadays, since all the American stuff's down.

1253
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:51,640
And, of course, the one site whenever we're talking about Japanese stepmania, the one thing you have to bring up is Food Mix.

1254
01:47:51,640 --> 01:47:56,640
And, yes, it was announced this week that Food Mix 2 Advanced Edition will be coming out.

1255
01:47:56,640 --> 01:48:15,640
When? That's a good question, I don't know. But they have a few screenshots up on their site, there's a link on our front page to it, and go check it out. It looks good as ever, and I can't wait. Tons of new stuff. You know they're gonna have stuff from Diverse Systems. It's always a great package once it's put together.

1256
01:48:15,640 --> 01:48:19,640
Some other things that I might point out in our forums in the Orange Launch Radio, I do

1257
01:48:19,640 --> 01:48:26,640
have a link to, um, there's a theme called Pop Candy. The website that had it up originally

1258
01:48:26,640 --> 01:48:31,680
went down, luckily I downloaded it a long ass time ago, so I hosted it for you guys.

1259
01:48:31,680 --> 01:48:37,640
You can go download that on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, just check in the forums, you'll find it.

1260
01:48:37,640 --> 01:48:44,320
And other than that, um, there was the Siberia theme, 2.1 got released, and for those who

1261
01:48:44,320 --> 01:48:50,280
don't know what that is that's the step mania theme that looks sort of like the

1262
01:48:50,280 --> 01:48:54,880
techno fiend it's the Japanese one it does look very good and I've actually

1263
01:48:54,880 --> 01:49:00,720
switched this to my default theme I like it a lot and so definitely check that

1264
01:49:00,720 --> 01:49:07,280
out as well other than that really there's a whole thread on the money

1265
01:49:07,280 --> 01:49:12,160
style of basically it's the fan mix watch thread and they've got a whole

1266
01:49:12,160 --> 01:49:15,960
bunch of different ones you can go check out on there. Most of them, of course,

1267
01:49:15,960 --> 01:49:19,000
aren't not done, but you can still download some of the songs, and they're

1268
01:49:19,000 --> 01:49:23,920
pretty good. So check those out. And as well, they also have, um, there's a Megamix

1269
01:49:23,920 --> 01:49:28,000
from the Food Mix soundtrack, because it's on their website, and it's password

1270
01:49:28,000 --> 01:49:31,840
locked, and of course someone brute-force hacked that, and so they have the

1271
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,520
password for that as well. So you can go listen to that Megamix and check that

1272
01:49:36,520 --> 01:49:44,680
out so that's pretty much everything all right sounds good I'm I liked food mix a

1273
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:47,400
whole heck of a lot so I'm really excited about food mix to that sounds

1274
01:49:47,400 --> 01:49:52,280
like you get a good addition so you know it's kind of neat because when you hear

1275
01:49:52,280 --> 01:49:56,920
all this news about you know in the groove and neon FM and was that on dance

1276
01:49:56,920 --> 01:50:01,480
tracks or whatever and all these kind of DDR knockoffs that are because spawning

1277
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:06,320
from the sim scene and you know what it and I realized in the groove is getting

1278
01:50:06,320 --> 01:50:11,780
a lot of credit now but let's face it it started as a simc knockoff game because

1279
01:50:11,780 --> 01:50:17,780
it is step mania basically in a box it's very interesting to see that food mix is

1280
01:50:17,780 --> 01:50:23,080
which I believe to be the king of all this stuff is not an arcade thing

1281
01:50:23,080 --> 01:50:27,100
it's interesting yeah if it were ever to make it to the arcade scene if they

1282
01:50:27,100 --> 01:50:31,340
actually were to do something similar what they're doing here within the

1283
01:50:31,340 --> 01:50:38,560
groove over in Japan with food mix I think you'll wipe the floor with in the

1284
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:44,200
group it would simply just topple it it's just better songs better everything

1285
01:50:44,200 --> 01:50:51,080
better graphics it's just so much so better you know done then in the groove

1286
01:50:51,080 --> 01:50:56,120
it's not even funny it's just you can't even compare them definitely check it

1287
01:50:56,120 --> 01:51:02,360
out. If you haven't already downloaded FoodMix 1 and FoodMix Plus, I think you can still

1288
01:51:02,360 --> 01:51:08,160
do that. Definitely download those. It's a huge download, so if you're on dial-up, probably

1289
01:51:08,160 --> 01:51:13,920
not going to be able to play that, but if you're not, check it out if you haven't already.

1290
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:18,480
I think in our next break, maybe if we can round up some songs, we'll do some FoodMix

1291
01:51:18,480 --> 01:51:22,240
music and maybe some other stuff too. I actually, we haven't played any In The Groove songs

1292
01:51:22,240 --> 01:51:25,800
in a while, so I think there's actually a couple songs that are worth playing. I know,

1293
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:32,800
Jamie's frowning of disapproval. My poor ears. I know. There are some songs I like in In

1294
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:38,120
the Groove, so I'm going to play one of those. Alright, let's hear about the winner of tonight's

1295
01:51:38,120 --> 01:51:46,960
cage match, shall we? Why not? Why not? Alright, so you guys voted and there was a pretty clear

1296
01:51:46,960 --> 01:51:51,160
winner tonight. I've got to say I was kind of surprised by it. There's a brand new winner

1297
01:51:51,160 --> 01:52:01,080
tonight and it's had a way what is love reloaded you know what I think they're

1298
01:52:01,080 --> 01:52:04,280
just nostalgia whores kind of like I am because I think when that when that song

1299
01:52:04,280 --> 01:52:07,200
started playing a lot of them were like I remember this song ever that I guess

1300
01:52:07,200 --> 01:52:12,640
the scene from was it at night of the rock yeah neither Roxbury is I think I

1301
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:18,000
think I don't know I think that you know that's not you heard it a lot apparently

1302
01:52:18,000 --> 01:52:23,000
And that song was pretty damn horrid when that movie was out, but it's been a while. I think most people have forgot it.

1303
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:33,000
There's a station in Mobile, I'll go ahead and name it as WABB, who when that song came out, it literally played once every 30 minutes.

1304
01:52:33,000 --> 01:52:34,000
I kid you not.

1305
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:38,000
Wow, I would totally listen to a station that played that kind of stuff. That's awesome.

1306
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:45,000
Well, they've also played a bunch of crap, because at the time I think it was like the tail end of Color Me Bad, remember them?

1307
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,000
Oh, unfortunately I do.

1308
01:52:46,000 --> 01:52:53,000
I mean, they really overplayed all the stuff that was really, you know, popular at the time, and it just drove me crazy.

1309
01:52:53,000 --> 01:52:57,000
So it's just the fact that the song exists.

1310
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:04,000
But you know, every so often I'll catch it, and I'll kinda go, oh, I remember this.

1311
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:05,000
So I remember that song.

1312
01:53:05,000 --> 01:53:08,000
Oh. Oh. Oh.

1313
01:53:10,000 --> 01:53:11,000
I'll stop.

1314
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:35,000
Alright, let's see. So we got that. I know what else I wanted to say. I wanted to kind of give a shout out to one of our buddies. You know her as RicePrincess from Thursday Nights Outside the Box. She goes by a ton of other names though. Mojiko, Irene. She's a woman of many different names out there, but you guys know, I'm sure you guys are familiar with her.

1315
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:47,000
And I don't usually talk about big commercial gaming sites, but there's one in particular that I've grown quite fond of lately, and that's 1up.com. I actually really like them quite a bit. I would endorse them. They're a great site.

1316
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:55,000
We even have our own club over there. I will post the URL to that club in a little bit. I think it's, what, like Orangelandsradioclub or something like that.

1317
01:53:55,000 --> 01:54:04,000
.1up.com. Well, there's a dash in there. Here, I got the link. I'll just post that for you guys in the chat room if you want to join the Orangelandsradioclub.1up.com.

1318
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:09,680
Anyway, back to Rice Princess. Not only did she start that club on our behalf over there,

1319
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:14,440
but she was actually named Blog of the Day. And I don't know if that was today or yesterday,

1320
01:54:14,440 --> 01:54:19,000
but her 1UP.com blog was named Blog of the Day because she made this really big post

1321
01:54:19,000 --> 01:54:22,760
about the Dear Friends concert that she went to Monday night in San Francisco, and somebody

1322
01:54:22,760 --> 01:54:26,360
noticed and shared a little love. So we just want to say congratulations to our buddy Rice

1323
01:54:26,360 --> 01:54:36,200
princess on being to blog of the day do you know me I am so famous all right

1324
01:54:36,680 --> 01:54:40,080
all right I guess on that note we're gonna go so we have the cage match

1325
01:54:40,080 --> 01:54:43,000
winner we got that okay I guess we're gonna do a break when we come back from

1326
01:54:43,000 --> 01:54:46,080
this break it will finally get to that list list we talked about and the F use

1327
01:54:46,080 --> 01:54:48,840

1328
01:54:48,840 --> 01:54:52,520
and this break some food mix and whatever else I can dig up we'll be

1329
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:55,600
back after this started off with a little bit of evergreen from food mix

1330
01:54:55,600 --> 01:54:57,600
We'll be back after this.

1331
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:27,600
Feel the tension in my head

1332
01:55:44,600 --> 01:55:46,600
He's the green operator

1333
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:48,600
Pitting time on the battery up in the light

1334
01:55:48,600 --> 01:55:50,960
We'll see what they can do,

1335
01:56:20,960 --> 01:56:27,960
Feel you.

1336
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:21,960
Hey!

1337
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,960
Hey!

1338
01:57:36,960 --> 01:57:37,960
Hey!

1339
02:02:37,960 --> 02:02:44,960
opened

1340
02:02:48,860 --> 02:02:56,360
with

1341
02:02:56,360 --> 02:02:59,360
the

1342
02:02:59,360 --> 02:03:03,800
hmm

1343
02:03:03,800 --> 02:03:07,460
end

1344
02:03:07,460 --> 02:03:12,700
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1345
02:03:12,700 --> 02:03:17,140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1346
02:03:17,140 --> 02:03:23,620
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1347
02:03:23,620 --> 02:03:27,260
Hi guys, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that set of mix there

1348
02:03:27,260 --> 02:03:33,260
from some various sim file scene. I don't know how to kind of loop all that together,

1349
02:03:33,260 --> 02:03:38,700
but what can you do? Beat Drop, er, not Beat Drop, what the hell, that was the song from

1350
02:03:38,700 --> 02:03:43,660
the Cage Match. Starting this off was Evergreen from Food Mix, then Zodiac from In the Groove,

1351
02:03:43,660 --> 02:03:51,980
Mirrorball, and P8107 after that, both from Food Mix as well. Loki is obsessed with this

1352
02:03:51,980 --> 02:03:56,360
new show called Robot Chicken, which I actually watched last Sunday, actually I've been watching

1353
02:03:56,360 --> 02:04:00,820
it every week because I think it's pretty damn funny too, but last Sunday was especially

1354
02:04:00,820 --> 02:04:05,540
funny because they made fun of Mario Kart. Well, not really made fun, but they totally

1355
02:04:05,540 --> 02:04:08,620
paid homage to Mario Kart. I'll let Loki explain. It was awesome.

1356
02:04:08,620 --> 02:04:13,260
Okay, basically, Robot Chicken, for those who don't know, it's this 15-minute long show

1357
02:04:13,260 --> 02:04:18,920
that's on Cartoon Network, Sundays at 1130, and I think they also have it repeating throughout

1358
02:04:18,920 --> 02:04:24,260
the entire week. Yeah, it repeats at, well, I don't know if anyone's gonna be awake, but

1359
02:04:24,260 --> 02:04:35,020
Monday at 2.30 a.m., Fridays at midnight and 3 a.m., and so you can check them out then.

1360
02:04:35,020 --> 02:04:40,580
Their last night's, basically, anyway, so 15 minute show, it's all stop animation with

1361
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:49,640
toys and claymation. It's hilarious. Like, for example, week one, we had, they did a

1362
02:04:49,640 --> 02:04:54,980
parody of like the was it the Rachel Lee Cook's public service announcement you

1363
02:04:54,980 --> 02:04:58,520
know where this is your brain on drugs you know but it doesn't stop there you

1364
02:04:58,520 --> 02:05:02,100
know this is your family and she's hitting stuff with you know a frying pan

1365
02:05:02,100 --> 02:05:06,820
it's hilarious I actually say right now although it is 1130 right now on the

1366
02:05:06,820 --> 02:05:09,380
East Coast that doesn't give you permission to stop listening to us and

1367
02:05:09,380 --> 02:05:13,140
go watch this you can download it on bit torrent later and also they replay it I

1368
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:17,860
a ton so get that but for you West Coast folks you'll be able to listen to it

1369
02:05:17,860 --> 02:05:31,860
Anyways, um, but yeah. Week one, the most memorable thing was Optimus Prime and the prostate cancer awareness video, and that was hilarious. Oh my God. Hilarious.

1370
02:05:31,860 --> 02:05:46,860
Um, then last week, um, they did a parody of Cannonball Run, you know, for those who don't remember, Cannonball Run was the Burt Reynolds movie, um, based on the actual Cannonball races, uh, where you race across the country and it's like a no-holds-barred thing,

1371
02:05:46,860 --> 02:05:50,200
thing and they have like all the weird teams of people and stuff so they have

1372
02:05:50,200 --> 02:05:54,500
like all these new icons from like the 80s and stuff they had they had Vin

1373
02:05:54,500 --> 02:06:02,820
Diesel supposedly as a character they had the ecto one speed racer Batman and

1374
02:06:02,820 --> 02:06:08,980
Robin the guys from chips and just a bunch of other weird people and Mario

1375
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:13,740
and Luigi and Wario from Mario Kart and there's one scene in there where they're

1376
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:19,300
actually in the race and they're all, I think it's time we use the blue tortoise shell!

1377
02:06:19,300 --> 02:06:26,300
And so they use the blue tortoise shell and it hits the guys from, what is it, it just

1378
02:06:26,300 --> 02:06:30,120
knocks one of the cars off the road and it was hilarious. You just honestly, I cannot

1379
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:35,200
describe it well enough, you really need to go watch the show tonight to give you a brief

1380
02:06:35,200 --> 02:06:40,200
preview of what's going to be on. This episode's called The Deep End, it says find out what

1381
02:06:40,200 --> 02:06:45,200
8. What happens when seven superheroes are forced to live under one roof in the real world metropol-

1382
02:06:45,200 --> 02:06:47,200
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

1383
02:06:47,200 --> 02:06:51,200
Wait a minute. Wasn't this called Drawn Together?

1384
02:06:51,200 --> 02:06:56,200
Okay, yes, maybe, but this will be better.

1385
02:06:56,200 --> 02:07:18,200
And then catch Adam James, er, James T. Kirk, Khan, and Noonien Shing or something, and Kirk Cameron sing, Noonien sing, and Kirk Cameron at work in a pizza joint, and two Kirks, a Khan, and a pizza place.

1386
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:24,200
And someone's on a mission to track down Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and kill Bunny.

1387
02:07:24,200 --> 02:07:30,200
And lastly, go backstage for America's favorite undead reality show, Zombie Idol.

1388
02:07:30,200 --> 02:07:37,200
So, and what's great about this show is they actually have a lot of the celebrities doing their own voices and stuff, and it, lots of work.

1389
02:07:37,200 --> 02:07:42,200
I mean, for example, last week, Luigi, voiced by Matthew Lillard.

1390
02:07:42,200 --> 02:07:51,200
Great stuff. Awesome. But really, watch the show. If you can't watch it, it's on torrentbox.com.

1391
02:07:51,200 --> 02:07:55,200
Actually, we have some folks in the chatroom saying, I'm TiVo-ing it right now!

1392
02:07:55,200 --> 02:08:02,200
And then I'm looking at our live listener stats, too, as this is going on. I know it's four people dropped while we were talking about Robot Chicken.

1393
02:08:02,200 --> 02:08:07,200
So, damn you! I told you not to leave to go watch it! Damn you!

1394
02:08:07,200 --> 02:08:11,880
Stop being cheap, buy a TiVo. I don't care if this show gets weak in its last hour.

1395
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:18,320
Alright. Speaking of that weak program you've come to know and love here at Orange

1396
02:08:18,320 --> 02:08:20,160
Launch Radio, it's time to do tonight's

1397
02:08:20,160 --> 02:08:23,700
listless segment! Yay!

1398
02:08:23,700 --> 02:08:30,700
So you know we need some theme music.

1399
02:08:31,200 --> 02:08:32,280
Alright.

1400
02:08:32,280 --> 02:08:42,360
Tonight's list list everybody is going to be, the topic is, slash commands I would like

1401
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:49,220
to see in an MMORPG, and of course this topic being spawned by the recent news about slash

1402
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:55,200
pizza being added into Pizza Hut, or I'm sorry, being added.

1403
02:08:55,200 --> 02:09:01,200
The newest MMORPG, Pizza Hut, where you play as a delivery person.

1404
02:09:01,200 --> 02:09:10,200
You have to avoid obstacles, such as dogs chasing you and throwing pizzas into, oh wait, that's Paperboy.

1405
02:09:10,200 --> 02:09:12,200
Alright, smartass.

1406
02:09:12,200 --> 02:09:16,200
Don't you know it? My ass is this smart. Imagine how smart my brain is.

1407
02:09:16,200 --> 02:09:23,200
is

1408
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:51,720
explicit are working as one team tonight they're one mind or no not any more oh

1409
02:09:51,720 --> 02:09:57,440
they are two separate entities now they have they have I know that's very that

1410
02:09:57,440 --> 02:10:04,160
does sound kind of wrong all right but really funny all right let's find this

1411
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:06,320
all right I'm gonna kill the background music we'll bring you back later

1412
02:10:06,320 --> 02:10:10,520
remember you guys get to vote you guys get to vote on the top three we're only

1413
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:14,480
creating the list so what's gonna happen is we're each gonna read off our top

1414
02:10:14,480 --> 02:10:20,680
three and then the fun part each one of us gets to take one off of the list and

1415
02:10:20,680 --> 02:10:26,360
then you guys in the chat room you get to vote on your favorite and as you guys

1416
02:10:26,360 --> 02:10:30,600
are suggesting these slash commands don't forget you have to put a dot or

1417
02:10:30,600 --> 02:10:33,960
something in front of it because if you actually try to type the slash command

1418
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:37,480
IRC will think you are actually trying to do a slash command and slash pizza

1419
02:10:37,480 --> 02:10:41,600
doesn't work in MRC I hate to see so oh we've got a lot of funny ones going on

1420
02:10:41,600 --> 02:10:45,660
in the chat room right now. Let's see what happens. Let's see if we get any matches.

1421
02:10:45,660 --> 02:10:49,080
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your number 3 pick for Slash command you'd

1422
02:10:49,080 --> 02:10:51,120
like to see in an MMORPG.

1423
02:10:51,120 --> 02:10:53,700
My first one is Slash Window.

1424
02:10:53,700 --> 02:10:55,340
And what does Slash Window do?

1425
02:10:55,340 --> 02:11:02,720
It opens up like a little PIP window, where you can like, you know, like if you, instead

1426
02:11:02,720 --> 02:11:06,240
of, cause you know, obviously they're not going to actually window Final Fantasy XI

1427
02:11:06,240 --> 02:11:11,420
without using something that they consider illegal. You know, you should be able to

1428
02:11:11,420 --> 02:11:17,400
access like the play online site as a window in window wait a minute you've

1429
02:11:17,400 --> 02:11:24,000
actually come up with a practical good idea but it's not funny I'm just it

1430
02:11:24,000 --> 02:11:26,900
doesn't have to be funny but I was I was really annoyed because usually what I

1431
02:11:26,900 --> 02:11:33,160
have to set up my laptop to use a fake use to play I just love in our chat room

1432
02:11:33,160 --> 02:11:35,840
right now you guys seriously if you haven't looked at what the chair all

1433
02:11:35,840 --> 02:11:45,020
your face I like slash girls but Sega Dreamcast all right even though I would

1434
02:11:45,020 --> 02:11:48,700
put I would have this would have been like my number four would have been like

1435
02:11:48,700 --> 02:11:57,020
slash PSO mode uh-huh run around from room to room okay let's see let's go on

1436
02:11:57,020 --> 02:12:02,700
explicit your number three please wait wait do you have a microphone over there

1437
02:12:02,700 --> 02:12:09,140
everybody? Yeah, so our listeners in here. Uh, slash yo mama. Slash yo mama, and what

1438
02:12:09,140 --> 02:12:14,340
does slash yo mama do? You know, they all saying, ooh I fucked yo mom and stuff. So

1439
02:12:14,340 --> 02:12:23,340
slash yo mama would actually fuck your mama? Yeah. Ouch, I feel sorry for yo mama. Angel,

1440
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:28,340
You're number three.

1441
02:12:28,340 --> 02:12:31,340
Slash silly string.

1442
02:12:31,340 --> 02:12:32,340
Slash silly string.

1443
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:35,340
And what would slash silly string do?

1444
02:12:35,340 --> 02:12:42,340
Enable you with the silly string can so you can, like, have a silly string fight with the rest of your party.

1445
02:12:42,340 --> 02:12:44,340
Oh my. Let's get messy!

1446
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:48,340
Alright, Loki, you're number three.

1447
02:12:48,340 --> 02:13:07,000
slash Nicole Brown Simpson and I think we know this this would um yeah this

1448
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:13,780
would link you to the find the real killers website out there um yeah

1449
02:13:13,780 --> 02:13:18,700
because they're out there and loose and og Simpson is searching for them in

1450
02:13:18,700 --> 02:13:27,140
every golf course Wow Wow Wow Wow my number three needs a little bit of

1451
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:32,980
explaining my number three choice is slash ab shock now I don't know if

1452
02:13:32,980 --> 02:13:36,140
you've ever seen those infomercials for the things that you can actually like

1453
02:13:36,140 --> 02:13:43,000
strap on your abs that are gonna give you a good abs in six weeks when I pulled

1454
02:13:43,000 --> 02:13:46,920
my butt muscle so when you type slash abs shock it'll just you know give you

1455
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:49,920
that little pinch right in your abs so that you can work out while you play an

1456
02:13:49,920 --> 02:13:55,380
MMORPG because you know everybody that plays an MMO is fat right of course yeah

1457
02:13:55,380 --> 02:14:00,520
right no not really all right anorexic from having the lack of slash pizza all

1458
02:14:00,520 --> 02:14:04,520
Alright, let's see, DarkSakurai, you're number two.

1459
02:14:04,520 --> 02:14:08,520
Let me pull up the file again.

1460
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:10,520
I love my laptop.

1461
02:14:10,520 --> 02:14:12,520
Slash Sim.

1462
02:14:12,520 --> 02:14:16,520
What that does is it creates a simulacrum of yourself to go to your job.

1463
02:14:16,520 --> 02:14:20,520
Like the Calvin clone machine.

1464
02:14:20,520 --> 02:14:24,520
Wow. Someday, I hope. Wow, very nice.

1465
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:26,520
Slash Sim.

1466
02:14:26,520 --> 02:14:37,380
explicit slash pubic hairs um is this for all the 12 and 13 year olds to play

1467
02:14:37,380 --> 02:14:45,260
MMOs or what anybody I hope that one day what did the hell is this slash command

1468
02:14:45,260 --> 02:14:56,620
supposed to do all right all right what this uh what this code does as well you

1469
02:14:56,620 --> 02:15:01,580
know how people like fantasize about if it's clean if it's basically a new code

1470
02:15:01,580 --> 02:15:10,380
without the pubic hair I see okay but some do speaking which house I wonder

1471
02:15:10,380 --> 02:15:14,380
How did your 40 days without a boner thing go, speaking of which?

1472
02:15:14,380 --> 02:15:18,380
Oh, by the way, I'm surviving. I got a few more days.

1473
02:15:18,380 --> 02:15:19,380
Wow.

1474
02:15:19,380 --> 02:15:25,380
Meaning I've not got a morning boner, or I see any attractive tits, or porno, or strip club.

1475
02:15:25,380 --> 02:15:27,380
You'll never get a boner again.

1476
02:15:27,380 --> 02:15:29,380
Oh, God. Don't even think about it.

1477
02:15:29,380 --> 02:15:30,380
All right.

1478
02:15:30,380 --> 02:15:31,380
Anyways, I'll explain that later.

1479
02:15:31,380 --> 02:15:36,380
Angel, Angel, your number two pick.

1480
02:15:36,380 --> 02:15:39,380
Sorry, you need a mic, don't you?

1481
02:15:39,380 --> 02:15:46,940
Bitch slap. Now, would slash bitch slap, bitch slap you or the other player?

1482
02:15:46,940 --> 02:15:53,540
Um, like, let's say you have somebody in your party that you don't like or isn't doing their job yet, right?

1483
02:15:53,540 --> 02:15:57,100
Just do slash bitch slap. Alright, sounds good.

1484
02:15:57,100 --> 02:16:01,260
Um, Loki, you're number two.

1485
02:16:01,260 --> 02:16:04,420
I think the only appropriate thing that we're actually missing from

1486
02:16:04,420 --> 02:16:07,500
an MMORPG is slash dingo

1487
02:16:07,500 --> 02:16:13,320
because you know when someone really pisses you off online you really wish a

1488
02:16:13,320 --> 02:16:14,920
dingo would go eat their baby

1489
02:16:14,920 --> 02:16:19,820
and so now you can have that thanks to our brand new dingo technology

1490
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:22,820
dingos can and will eat your babies

1491
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:29,980
my number two pick is

1492
02:16:29,980 --> 02:16:35,780
slash Fred Durst porn video and the reason for this is because when you guys

1493
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:38,600
are feeling a little bit inadequate because you're staying in the house all

1494
02:16:38,600 --> 02:16:43,340
day and playing MMORPGs you can type slash Fred Durst porn video and you

1495
02:16:43,340 --> 02:16:45,940
could see that you can have it off a lot worse and you'll feel better about

1496
02:16:45,940 --> 02:16:54,260
yourself all right so slash Fred Durst porn video um I typed slash Fred all

1497
02:16:54,260 --> 02:17:02,140
right Jamie you're number one my number one is slash ID BFG anyone ever play

1498
02:17:02,140 --> 02:17:14,940
Doom? Imagine going around Final Fantasy 11 with the BFG. Okay. Imagine gunning

1499
02:17:14,940 --> 02:17:21,420
down anything that gets in your way with extreme prejudice. Very nice. I could just

1500
02:17:21,420 --> 02:17:28,340
imagine right now, battering around, fuck you! Button. All right, sounds good, so

1501
02:17:28,340 --> 02:17:33,340
IDBFG, just like the Doom days. Alright, explicit, you're number one.

1502
02:17:33,340 --> 02:17:36,340
Go ahead, hmm. Slash TAC.

1503
02:17:36,340 --> 02:17:42,340
Ahh, or it's TACO. We actually got corrected months ago.

1504
02:17:42,340 --> 02:17:43,340
Yeah, TACO.

1505
02:17:43,340 --> 02:17:47,340
So this would actually, like TACO, so this would actually play a TACO song.

1506
02:17:47,340 --> 02:17:49,340
Yeah, some TACO songs.

1507
02:17:49,340 --> 02:17:50,340
You know where there's some of them in my room.

1508
02:17:50,340 --> 02:17:57,340
That's a damn good application for the slashing man. Alright, good job. Angel, you're number one.

1509
02:17:57,340 --> 02:18:02,340
Wait, it's upside down to...

1510
02:18:02,340 --> 02:18:04,340
Slash engulf.

1511
02:18:04,340 --> 02:18:06,340
Ah, that made you giggle.

1512
02:18:06,340 --> 02:18:10,340
And what, pray tell, does that do? Does it engulf your opponent in flames?

1513
02:18:10,340 --> 02:18:14,340
Either your opponent or somebody in your party you don't like.

1514
02:18:14,340 --> 02:18:18,340
So, engulf is the number one. Alright.

1515
02:18:18,340 --> 02:18:21,340
Loki, you're number one.

1516
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:25,340
I figured this is the most needed thing in the world.

1517
02:18:25,340 --> 02:18:32,700
slash real girl. Because some of those people, they need to realize they need to find a real

1518
02:18:32,700 --> 02:18:42,620
girl and not masturbate to fictional women. So slash real girl, yes, that's what's needed.

1519
02:18:42,620 --> 02:18:46,860
Alright, and my number one is slash give me a dollar.

1520
02:18:46,860 --> 02:18:52,680
Oh, very cool.

1521
02:18:52,680 --> 02:18:56,280
And when you type it, it will give you a dollar, but you can't overuse it.

1522
02:18:56,280 --> 02:18:57,280
All right.

1523
02:18:57,280 --> 02:18:58,280
So here it is.

1524
02:18:58,280 --> 02:19:00,280
Here is the list as it stands currently.

1525
02:19:00,280 --> 02:19:06,280
Slash window slash yo mama slash silly string slash Nicole Brown Simpson slash ab shock

1528
02:19:21,160 --> 02:19:26,380
aside so that Jamie can take one of these off of the list slash silly string

1529
02:19:26,380 --> 02:19:31,340
and I hate silly string slash silly string silly string to my car once it is

1530
02:19:31,340 --> 02:19:35,060
a bitch to clean up all right except it was raining they were being really

1533
02:19:43,980 --> 02:19:53,700
tough choice hmm slash them sorry it does kind of sound like the Sims

1534
02:19:53,700 --> 02:19:56,820
although I guess that's kind of the idea behind it but we wouldn't want people to

1535
02:19:56,820 --> 02:20:00,220
get confused because Americans do get a little too easily confused all right

1536
02:20:00,220 --> 02:20:05,980
angel one of these has got to go you're gonna kill me porn video that was the

I'm going to eliminate slash pubic hairs because I didn't really get it. So, sorry, explicit.

1539
02:20:22,060 --> 02:20:25,060
All right, Loki, you're going to pick the last one that's come off this list.

1540
02:20:25,060 --> 02:20:37,060
I'm going to have to say slash window because it's just not funny and we need funny.

1541
02:20:37,060 --> 02:20:41,860

02:22:32,580 --> 02:22:35,040
Who knew that Zaku could say something funny?

Far away on the other side

1571
02:23:36,840 --> 02:23:40,340
She was caught in the middle of the desert fire

1572
02:23:40,340 --> 02:23:43,840
And she couldn't find how to push through

1573
02:23:43,840 --> 02:23:47,340
She sang for in the evening

1574
02:23:47,340 --> 02:23:50,840
Carried away by a moonlight shed

1575
02:23:50,840 --> 02:23:54,340
And sang a song when breathing

1576
02:23:54,340 --> 02:23:57,840
Carried away by a moonlight shed

1577
02:23:57,840 --> 02:24:01,340
And though she saw what's been and when it's gone

1578
02:24:01,340 --> 02:24:04,300
Far away on the other side

1579
02:24:04,300 --> 02:24:07,660
He was shot six times by a man on the run

1580
02:24:07,660 --> 02:24:10,780
And she couldn't find how to push through

1581
02:24:11,980 --> 02:24:14,540
I said, I said, I prayed

1582
02:24:14,540 --> 02:24:18,460

Carried away by a moonlight

1585
02:24:24,340 --> 02:24:28,700
Checked and watched your vision burning

1586
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:31,180
Carrying away by the moonlight

1587
02:24:31,180 --> 02:24:34,540

Number three, slash Nicole Brown Simpson.

1611
02:26:57,100 --> 02:26:59,460
I don't know what the hell you guys are thinking there.

1612
02:26:59,460 --> 02:27:00,700
I can see why it's third.

1613
02:27:00,700 --> 02:27:03,740
It's been to before.

1614
02:27:03,740 --> 02:27:09,100

All right.

1617
02:27:11,540 --> 02:27:17,380
And in first place, slash give me a dollar.

1618
02:27:17,380 --> 02:27:19,820
All right.

1619
02:27:19,820 --> 02:27:20,500
There you go.

1620
02:27:20,500 --> 02:27:22,100
So there it is.

1621
02:27:22,100 --> 02:27:23,460
And so it is said, so it is done.

1622
02:27:23,460 --> 02:27:25,560
So write those EverQuest 2 folks and tell them you would

1623
02:27:25,560 --> 02:27:30,560
like to see slash give me a dollar or at least slash Nicole you guys are fucked

1624
02:27:30,560 --> 02:27:35,440
all right I know you guys have lots of more slash ideas to post in our chat

1625
02:27:35,440 --> 02:27:39,320
room but maybe you want to keep it down a little bit and let the folks talk

1626
02:27:39,320 --> 02:27:45,120
about the show at hand and what's coming up next the F use of the week that's

1627
02:27:45,120 --> 02:27:49,640
right it's time to get a little bit angry Jamie why do we have to get a

1628
02:27:49,640 --> 02:27:56,640
little bit angry every single week. Grr. Argh.

1629
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:13,640
You know, F.D.A. to people who drive while they talk on their cell phones.

1630
02:28:13,640 --> 02:28:18,480
I witnessed an accident nearly happen today because

1631
02:28:18,480 --> 02:28:21,880
both drivers were on their damn cell phone. Just fuck them.

1632
02:28:21,880 --> 02:28:25,720
Sorry, Rob. Well, I don't think other people should be on their cell phones, just me.

1633
02:28:25,720 --> 02:28:30,720
So that wouldn't have happened. No. Well, you know the law is going to pass this year, so I'm looking forward to that.

1634
02:28:30,720 --> 02:28:35,280
Um, there's also, uh,

1635
02:28:35,280 --> 02:28:39,240
shoot, I was thinking about this earlier today,

1636
02:28:39,240 --> 02:28:42,760
and I completely forgot what it was.

1637
02:28:42,760 --> 02:28:53,440
Oh yeah, F you to people, and this is more of a situational F you, but when people complain

1638
02:28:53,440 --> 02:28:59,680
about how much their life sucks yet they don't do anything about it, fuck that.

1639
02:28:59,680 --> 02:29:06,960
You don't have a right to complain until you are actively working to remedy your situation.

1640
02:29:06,960 --> 02:29:14,160
know you can say oh well I'm tired of being fat or something like that well

1641
02:29:14,160 --> 02:29:19,460
you could get up and go to the gym you can eat less you know you there's

1642
02:29:19,460 --> 02:29:25,180
something you can do about that you know oh I tired of living where I do well

1643
02:29:25,180 --> 02:29:30,020
then if you can't do it right now save up your money work toward a goal and

1644
02:29:30,020 --> 02:29:37,660
move you know or you know it's just even if you can't do something about it now

1645
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:42,780
at least make a semblance of working for it because it just seems like like

1646
02:29:42,780 --> 02:29:52,220
there's no drive you know I don't understand that I also have a big SU to

1647
02:29:52,220 --> 02:29:57,620
people who complain about not having money yet continue to frivolously spend

1648
02:29:57,620 --> 02:30:01,760
on shit they don't need you know I've had to I've had to break myself of this

1649
02:30:01,760 --> 02:30:06,920
habit too but I recognize that I don't have the you know that I don't have

1650
02:30:06,920 --> 02:30:10,400
money because I spent it on this this this and this well now I can actually

1651
02:30:10,400 --> 02:30:14,280
say I don't have the money to spend on it because I'm saving up to buy a house

1652
02:30:14,280 --> 02:30:23,300
which is true I'm gonna be buying a house this year but it's also it's just

1653
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:27,240
again I don't understand the whole mentality of how people can bitch about

1654
02:30:27,240 --> 02:30:34,000
something yet not do anything to remedy it you know what I mean I also big SU'd

1655
02:30:34,000 --> 02:30:42,400
to the car wash line at Chevron today there were seven people in the damn line

1656
02:30:42,400 --> 02:30:46,680
and the line wasn't moving so I'm gonna have to go back after the show at night

1657
02:30:46,680 --> 02:30:50,880
and get my car washed where the water will not evaporate as quickly big SU'd

1658
02:30:50,880 --> 02:30:54,760
not having an air conditioner but hey I'm going to have my air conditioning

1659
02:30:54,760 --> 02:31:00,640
replaced next week. I'm doing something about it. That's been my big thing, is people who

1660
02:31:00,640 --> 02:31:07,640
just don't do anything to fix their situation. So, I'm done.

1661
02:31:09,040 --> 02:31:14,640
Alright, Loki's turn!

1662
02:31:14,640 --> 02:31:20,640
First off, I'd like to say a big fuck you to Allergies, because they've been kicking

1663
02:31:20,640 --> 02:31:27,960
my ass all week I'm just now starting to feel a little bit better but I don't

1664
02:31:27,960 --> 02:31:31,720
think that's gonna last very long because it's allergy season and I'm

1665
02:31:31,720 --> 02:31:37,040
affected by both mold and pollen so I'm fucked all year round pretty much like

1666
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:43,560
what I am at work anyway fuck you to work for being a little boring I tried

1667
02:31:43,560 --> 02:31:49,200
making a catapult out of my pen last week and I got a little bit of ink on

1668
02:31:49,200 --> 02:31:55,120
My finger because I guess pens don't like to be turned into catapults. Oh well so much for that and

1669
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:57,680
then

1670
02:31:57,680 --> 02:32:05,040
Also, fuck you the fact that I need like I have this urge for projects even though I haven't finished other projects, and I really

1671
02:32:05,640 --> 02:32:08,840
It's hard. It's like crack. I can't stop

1672
02:32:08,840 --> 02:32:14,880
I just got a build crap, and I don't know why it's like I don't even use what I build

1673
02:32:14,880 --> 02:32:17,840
It's I don't get it, but um

1674
02:32:17,840 --> 02:32:23,840
Um, yeah, it's just some weird obsession that I have, so I just can't stop.

1675
02:32:23,840 --> 02:32:31,040
And um, fuck you to Lindsay Lohan for acting, because you suck, and I don't really need

1676
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:36,040
you to, you know, why does Disney have to fucking remake every movie that they've made?

1677
02:32:36,040 --> 02:32:38,120
Because you know what, all the remakes suck.

1678
02:32:38,120 --> 02:32:39,120
So fuck those.

1679
02:32:39,120 --> 02:32:44,720
Fuck, you know, it's not a mask because that sucked, and it's still being made, and I got

1680
02:32:44,720 --> 02:32:49,440
damn screener for it and it's dirty no or actually i didn't get a screener for it but

1681
02:32:49,440 --> 02:32:56,480
fuck i got tickets to it and i never went and saw it so it was good um and then finally fuck you the

1682
02:32:56,480 --> 02:33:01,920
family that's suing michael jackson because i believe that they're just seeing him as an easy

1683
02:33:01,920 --> 02:33:08,400
target to try to get money and if you actually follow the testimony there's a lot of um

1684
02:33:08,400 --> 02:33:16,160
discrepancies, let's put it that way, in their testimony, and I hope they get sued. Oh, and

1685
02:33:16,160 --> 02:33:19,000
another thing, I'm not sure if anyone heard about it, there was actually a news report

1686
02:33:19,000 --> 02:33:23,640
a while back of this guy that sued, I believe it's ABC or whoever the fuck puts out that

1687
02:33:23,640 --> 02:33:33,480
goddamn show, Fear Factor, he basically got sick and dizzy and fell into a door well from

1688
02:33:33,480 --> 02:33:39,160
watching this show and this is suing them and there was justice being done

1689
02:33:39,160 --> 02:33:43,920
and the judge said fuck you this is a frivolous lawsuit and threw it right

1690
02:33:43,920 --> 02:33:47,880
back at him and didn't award him any money so at least there's some justice

1691
02:33:47,880 --> 02:33:52,200
in this world and I'm done

1692
02:33:57,240 --> 02:34:02,040
and F you to E online for I'm sorry not E online but E entertainment television

1693
02:34:02,040 --> 02:34:07,420
for having those really addicting Michael Jackson trial wrap-up shows, where they actually

1694
02:34:07,420 --> 02:34:11,900
reenact what's going on in the courtroom, because that shit is hilarious. The guy that

1695
02:34:11,900 --> 02:34:18,480
they have play Michael Jackson is very eerie, like, identical, it's crazy. Except they drew

1696
02:34:18,480 --> 02:34:24,300
on his nose, I'm not kidding you, it's horrible, it's like his nose is drawn on. It's disgusting.

1697
02:34:24,300 --> 02:34:29,220
Um, and F you to house hunting, because it's a pain in the ass, and I've been kind of looking

1698
02:34:29,220 --> 02:34:35,100
for like a new place where the new Orange Lounge Studio will be and we found five places

1699
02:34:35,100 --> 02:34:39,360
on the internet we liked, we drove by and only liked two of them when we drove by them

1700
02:34:39,360 --> 02:34:43,340
and one of them is in the ghetto so it's kind of a question mark although it sucks because

1701
02:34:43,340 --> 02:34:46,640
that was by far my favorite house it was such a cute little house and a little gate and

1702
02:34:46,640 --> 02:34:50,300
everything like I really want it and it's affordable but it's in the ghetto I'm like

1703
02:34:50,300 --> 02:34:55,660
but I kind of want it I'm like I could get a guard dog Orange Lounge Radio coming to

1704
02:34:55,660 --> 02:35:01,180
you live from the ghetto yes that's right we're coming to you from South

1705
02:35:01,180 --> 02:35:07,300
Sac no it's all right we'll figure something out I'll figure something out

1706
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:11,900
I always do so but a house hunting sucks so if you do that and if you do just

1707
02:35:11,900 --> 02:35:16,700
moving in general because moving sucks because can you imagine having to like

1708
02:35:16,700 --> 02:35:22,020
clean this apartment is gonna suck it's gonna be horrible but you know what the

1709
02:35:22,020 --> 02:35:27,180
place I lived in in Chico was worse and I made it somehow so I'll get through

1710
02:35:27,180 --> 02:35:34,200
this all right let's get to our guest FUs starting it off with oh the marathon

1711
02:35:34,200 --> 02:35:41,420
man himself explicit all right let's see I'd like to give an FV to work for

1712
02:35:41,420 --> 02:35:45,020
letting me stay in the Sun for having me stay in the Sun without getting me a

1713
02:35:45,020 --> 02:35:51,180
break at work Jesus yeah that yesterday was extremely hot and someone who was

1714
02:35:51,180 --> 02:35:55,180
I was supposed to be giving breaks because I was working 10 o'clock in the morning till like 6 at night.

1715
02:35:55,180 --> 02:35:58,180
Did not give me a break and everybody else got a break.

1716
02:35:58,180 --> 02:36:04,180
Well guess what, I almost got a heat stroke and almost fainted.

1717
02:36:04,180 --> 02:36:11,180
And F goes to a lot of depression towards this and pressure family-wise.

1718
02:36:11,180 --> 02:36:16,180
Of course some of you know that my dad passed away like 2 years ago.

1719
02:36:16,180 --> 02:36:17,180
Sorry to hear that.

1720
02:36:17,180 --> 02:36:22,380
Yeah, and it's been tough, but some people are pushing me to a point where they don't

1721
02:36:22,380 --> 02:36:24,540
even understand what I'm going through.

1722
02:36:24,540 --> 02:36:27,300
They think it's, oh, so what?

1723
02:36:27,300 --> 02:36:34,900
I'm like, okay, a person died two years ago, and you gotta talk trash behind his back?

1724
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:40,460
That really hurts, especially when I caught somebody in the cemetery trying to steal flowers.

1725
02:36:40,460 --> 02:36:41,460
What?

1726
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:42,460
Yes.

1727
02:36:42,460 --> 02:36:43,460
Oh, man.

1728
02:36:43,460 --> 02:36:48,460
I love my woman, but this is the only way I can...

1729
02:36:48,460 --> 02:36:50,460
Yeah.

1730
02:36:50,460 --> 02:36:54,460
There's other ways to show your affection, other than stolen flowers.

1731
02:36:54,460 --> 02:37:02,460
Perhaps he was bringing flowers to his newly found corpse that he was going to have sex with.

1732
02:37:02,460 --> 02:37:03,460
It's like I give a damn.

1733
02:37:03,460 --> 02:37:05,460
Anyway.

1734
02:37:05,460 --> 02:37:07,460
You steal flowers in the cemetery, then...

1735
02:37:07,460 --> 02:37:09,460
That's hella simple.

1736
02:37:09,460 --> 02:37:13,700
Another F.V. goes to AlmostBreakingLent.

1737
02:37:13,700 --> 02:37:16,860
Did you get a semi-wood or something?

1738
02:37:16,860 --> 02:37:18,980
Came close, but no wood.

1739
02:37:18,980 --> 02:37:21,020
Let's see, a friend of mine

1740
02:37:21,020 --> 02:37:27,020
tested my ability to watch three hours of porn non-stop.

1741
02:37:27,020 --> 02:37:29,820
I'm like, I'm gonna kill you, but then again,

1742
02:37:29,820 --> 02:37:32,980
if I win this bet, I actually would get like a hundred bucks off of this.

1743
02:37:32,980 --> 02:37:37,760
How are they gonna know if you got a boner or not?

1744
02:37:37,760 --> 02:37:39,060
Well...

1745
02:37:39,060 --> 02:37:42,180
determine on the fact that this

1746
02:37:42,180 --> 02:37:44,760
that could be a lie

1747
02:37:44,760 --> 02:37:47,340
yeah you know what uh...

1748
02:37:47,340 --> 02:37:48,940
yeah i was uh...

1749
02:37:48,940 --> 02:37:51,580
hardcore heroin addict and i quit

1750
02:37:51,580 --> 02:37:52,980
uh...

1751
02:37:52,980 --> 02:37:55,500
i want a hundred dollars

1752
02:37:55,500 --> 02:37:57,820
if you guys know i'm a virgin

1753
02:37:57,820 --> 02:38:00,140
uh... did not know about that

1754
02:38:00,140 --> 02:38:04,380
exactly

1755
02:38:04,380 --> 02:38:05,820
Alright, anyway, sorry Xplosive.

1756
02:38:05,820 --> 02:38:08,780
Okay, how much time do we have? Okay.

1757
02:38:08,780 --> 02:38:10,780
I don't want to take too long, I don't want to have to-

1758
02:38:10,780 --> 02:38:11,740
Three seconds!

1759
02:38:11,740 --> 02:38:12,140
Three.

1760
02:38:12,140 --> 02:38:21,020
Okay, an F.U. goes to taxes, someone got one of the numbers wrong that's needed to file taxes,

1761
02:38:21,020 --> 02:38:24,180
and guess what, they come up to me and give me a mail saying that's the wrong number.

1762
02:38:24,180 --> 02:38:28,740
If I don't get the correct number, then I could've been arrested or fined a shitload of money.

1763
02:38:28,740 --> 02:38:31,660
I'm like, what the hell, why is this the wrong number?

1764
02:38:31,660 --> 02:38:39,660
Either the person who was coding up the, or counting the attacks, is either lazy or just being a dick.

1765
02:38:40,660 --> 02:38:51,660
If he goes to almost being sandwiched by three cars, both two of them an SUV and one a truck behind me.

1766
02:38:51,660 --> 02:38:57,660
You know what happens, like Dark Sakura said about people with the cell phones, yes I've actually seen that,

1767
02:38:57,660 --> 02:39:04,660
but this time they didn't even signal while heading to the same lane, which I almost got squashed.

1768
02:39:05,660 --> 02:39:10,660
Well, people need to learn how to drive, but to make sure this is short to be continued.

1769
02:39:10,660 --> 02:39:12,660
Alright, Angel.

1770
02:39:12,660 --> 02:39:13,660
As usual.

1771
02:39:13,660 --> 02:39:32,660
Okay, to follow up on explicit FUs. FU to death because sometimes you lose people that, you know, really shouldn't have been taken away from you as far as, you know, age or what have you.

1772
02:39:32,660 --> 02:39:40,580
and if you do the grieving process as well because it's not easy it's really

1773
02:39:40,580 --> 02:39:50,900
not and yeah so I guess is it maybe a few to final history all right let's get

I forgot one. Oh yes, Angel. F you to not one, but two deaths in one weekend.

1811
02:42:55,920 --> 02:43:04,920
Aww. So, yeah, that's all that has to be said. Unless you want me to do a short, but sweet explanation of that.

1812
02:43:04,920 --> 02:43:08,920
Um, I will leave it up to you. I don't want you to have to get into it if you don't want to.

1813
02:43:08,920 --> 02:43:12,920
Well, you know, that one friend that I talked about at the beginning of the show passing away.

1814
02:43:12,920 --> 02:43:17,140
And then we had a staff meeting for our show radio cough

1815
02:43:18,660 --> 02:43:20,660
You know, right and

1816
02:43:21,440 --> 02:43:23,640
Right before the meeting ended

1817
02:43:24,580 --> 02:43:30,120
He the manager got really really quiet and he's like, uh, I just got a phone call

1818
02:43:30,860 --> 02:43:32,860
Everybody goes what's wrong?

1819
02:43:32,940 --> 02:43:37,460
My friend just got stabbed and he passed away. That's too bad. So

1820
02:43:37,460 --> 02:43:46,060
So, yeah. That was just craptacular. Anyway, I'll shut up now and give you back the show.

1821
02:43:46,060 --> 02:43:51,900
That's alright, that's alright. Um, okay, so, on a completely different note, and when

1822
02:43:51,900 --> 02:43:56,500
I say completely, I mean completely different note, uh, Loki is looking up images on, I

1823
02:43:56,500 --> 02:44:00,560
guess it's Bamani-style's image boards, and he's pulled up popin' porn? What the hell

1824
02:44:00,560 --> 02:44:01,560
is this?

1825
02:44:01,560 --> 02:44:02,560
No!

1826
02:44:02,560 --> 02:44:22,560
It's back in their not-work-safe section, I just figured I'd take a look and see what's in there, and they've got a lot of not-work-safe stuff in there, and I don't know who the fuck draws this shit, honestly, but apparently there's a lot of it out there, and they've got some really, like, graphic pictures.

1827
02:44:22,560 --> 02:44:27,840
like for example um let's see here doo-doo-doo-doo-doo now we have this one

1828
02:44:27,840 --> 02:44:32,360
right here this is kind of a nice poet from pop and music getting ass fucked

1829
02:44:32,360 --> 02:44:39,200
and yeah um so anyways if you want to check out some Bahmani porn that's

1830
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:45,440
Bahmani style image boards not work safe enjoy to those of you folks that draw

1831
02:44:45,440 --> 02:44:50,960
those pictures get a life these people that actually draw those pictures get a

1832
02:44:50,960 --> 02:44:56,320
alive you can have a life in Japan as well yes

1833
02:44:56,320 --> 02:45:02,240

1834
02:45:02,240 --> 02:45:07,000

has has some has no hit no head cuts like Leon's head cut off or the zombies

1836
02:45:12,800 --> 02:45:18,960
huh it's a weird game but weird without the heads cut off stupid censorship it's

1837
02:45:18,960 --> 02:45:24,440
It's funny that they have more inappropriate stuff for other children compared to the ones

1838
02:45:24,440 --> 02:45:25,440
we have in America.

1839
02:45:25,440 --> 02:45:26,440
Oh well.

1840
02:45:26,440 --> 02:45:29,920
Sucks to be in Japan for that, for Resident Evil 4.

1841
02:45:29,920 --> 02:45:33,680
Alright, we're going to go to a quick break, you guys, when we come back.

1842
02:45:33,680 --> 02:45:36,460
Some Ask Orange Lounge, because we haven't done it in a while, so if you have a question

1843
02:45:36,460 --> 02:45:39,760
for us, send it over private message in the chat room, and then we're also going to wrap

1844
02:45:39,760 --> 02:45:46,760
things up you guys so we will be back after this.

1845
02:46:09,760 --> 02:46:17,760
I stand on the lights of TV and the radio

1846
02:46:17,760 --> 02:46:23,760
Still I can't escape the doors of doom

1847
02:46:23,760 --> 02:46:28,760
What has happened to it all?

1848
02:46:28,760 --> 02:46:31,760
Crazy some say

1849
02:46:31,760 --> 02:46:37,760
Where is the light that I recognize?

1850
02:46:37,760 --> 02:46:43,760
It's gone away But I won't cry at the end of the day

1851
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:53,760
There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find

1852
02:46:53,760 --> 02:47:00,760
And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world

1853
02:47:00,760 --> 02:47:07,760
I will learn to survive

1854
02:47:30,760 --> 02:47:32,760
Surrender

1855
02:47:32,760 --> 02:47:34,760
Love the old and the holy

1856
02:47:34,760 --> 02:47:36,760
You make me wonder

1857
02:47:36,760 --> 02:47:38,760
Oh, lovely heart

1858
02:47:38,760 --> 02:47:41,760
Just you can't drive me crazy

1859
02:47:41,760 --> 02:47:45,760
And I can scream out love and hate

1860
02:47:45,760 --> 02:47:47,760
I am

1861
02:47:47,760 --> 02:47:50,760
Who made me relight my fire

1862
02:47:50,760 --> 02:47:51,760
Sky high

1863
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:54,760
I should not dream it's real

1864
02:47:54,760 --> 02:47:57,760
Like a desert under your sky high

1865
02:47:57,760 --> 02:48:01,400
Chai chai, it's the best in the world, I will never

1866
02:48:01,400 --> 02:48:04,400
Keep my hope in my heart, in my mind

1867
02:48:06,400 --> 02:48:10,400
Chai chai, not a truth, not a dream, it's the real

1868
02:48:12,400 --> 02:48:16,400
Chai chai, it's the best in the world, I will never

1869
02:48:16,400 --> 02:48:46,360
Please listen to Orange Lounger.

1870
02:48:46,360 --> 02:48:53,360
Radio? Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1871
02:49:01,360 --> 02:49:04,560
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

1872
02:49:04,560 --> 02:49:08,200
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1873
02:49:08,200 --> 02:49:11,960
Will Loki ever find the Tekken 5 soundtrack?

1874
02:49:11,960 --> 02:49:15,600
Or will Jamie be forced to taunt him because she has it already?

1875
02:49:15,600 --> 02:49:21,880
Now you can see what we talk about in the studio on breaks.

1876
02:49:21,880 --> 02:49:24,880
Alright let's start it off with a question from MPQ.

1877
02:49:24,880 --> 02:49:28,920
My sister thinks all Taku songs sound the same.

1878
02:49:28,920 --> 02:49:31,380
Obviously this is unacceptable.

1879
02:49:31,380 --> 02:49:35,240
What do I do to fix this?

1880
02:49:35,240 --> 02:49:36,520
Chain her to a chair.

1881
02:49:36,520 --> 02:49:38,920
I was thinking the exact same thing.

1882
02:49:38,920 --> 02:49:45,040
And put her in one, actually better yet, put her in one of those total sensory deprivation

1883
02:49:45,040 --> 02:49:50,040
except that all it plays is Taku music and she'll learn the subtle differences.

1884
02:50:15,040 --> 02:50:20,620
StepMania. I was wondering if you have any tips for someone who has just started getting

1885
02:50:20,620 --> 02:50:25,040
into it. A little bit vague because we're not sure if you're talking about like making

1886
02:50:25,040 --> 02:50:28,240
step files or downloading. I'm assuming you're going to mean like you just are getting into

1887
02:50:28,240 --> 02:50:29,240
it for the first time and downloading.

1888
02:50:29,240 --> 02:50:31,400
I can probably explain this since I am a sim artist myself.

1889
02:50:31,400 --> 02:50:33,640
All right, make it quick though explicit because we only got about ten minutes so.

1890
02:50:33,640 --> 02:50:38,880
All right. The tips on sim files is one, select a good song that you feel like that people

1891
02:50:38,880 --> 02:50:48,300
would enjoy and two use programs like acid or or whatever as long as you cut

1892
02:50:48,300 --> 02:50:57,600
the track correct perfectly and three try to also use DWI I'm not sure if

1893
02:50:57,600 --> 02:51:03,180
other dudes um DWI tutorial is online but if you need that I can just price I

1894
02:51:03,180 --> 02:51:08,300
can probably send it to you on via AOL instant messenger time so for those who

1895
02:51:08,300 --> 02:51:09,800
who are interested in Simphile making.

1896
02:51:09,800 --> 02:51:12,920
So if you're into Simphile making, those are some good resources for you.

1897
02:51:12,920 --> 02:51:16,780
If you're into Simphile playing, my advice would be go and get some of those, like, big

1898
02:51:16,780 --> 02:51:17,780
pack songs.

1899
02:51:17,780 --> 02:51:19,660
Like, you know, Food Mix, things like that.

1900
02:51:19,660 --> 02:51:22,760
Go get some of those really, really well done Simphiles.

1901
02:51:22,760 --> 02:51:25,220
Look for the high-rated stuff on BamaniStyle.

1902
02:51:25,220 --> 02:51:30,940
Look for artists who have done a lot of songs, because artists, you know, folks that have

1903
02:51:30,940 --> 02:51:35,360
done, you know, when I say artists, I mean, like, Stepphile background and so forth, artists.

1904
02:51:35,360 --> 02:51:39,200
who have made a lot of songs have probably learned from their past mistakes, so they

1905
02:51:39,200 --> 02:51:43,360
start producing really quality stuff, so look for that.

1906
02:51:43,360 --> 02:51:47,400
It makes tests that have, like, you can get it labeled either keyboard or pad, so people

1907
02:51:47,400 --> 02:51:53,040
do not, like, get confused that they're downloading something that isn't their type, like, a keyboard,

1908
02:51:53,040 --> 02:51:56,680
like a person who wants to play just in the keyboard would not want something like pad

1909
02:51:56,680 --> 02:51:57,680
and vice versa.

1910
02:51:57,680 --> 02:52:02,480
Alright, and for the record, he was asking about the downloading part, not the creation,

1911
02:52:02,480 --> 02:52:05,920
But hey, there's a tip for you folks who want to create too as well.

1912
02:52:05,920 --> 02:52:07,360
We're going to help everybody out tonight.

1913
02:52:07,360 --> 02:52:09,240
Alright, let's move on to the next question.

1914
02:52:09,240 --> 02:52:12,560
DJ Rama S. Now this question has come up before, but we haven't talked about it in a while,

1915
02:52:12,560 --> 02:52:15,360
so we'll humor this question again.

1916
02:52:15,360 --> 02:52:18,200
How did Orange Lounge Radio come about?

1917
02:52:18,200 --> 02:52:21,480
Oh, you want to tell it or should I?

1918
02:52:21,480 --> 02:52:22,680
Why don't you?

1919
02:52:22,680 --> 02:52:25,480
We were on the BART.

1920
02:52:25,480 --> 02:52:27,880
Bay Area Rapid Transit.

1921
02:52:27,880 --> 02:52:29,640
Coming back from San Francisco, I thought.

1922
02:52:29,640 --> 02:52:36,240
We first discussed it going to San Francisco, and then we finalized it on the way back.

1923
02:52:36,240 --> 02:52:40,740
We wanted to do the station for some time because I had a lot of fun subbing on Under

1924
02:52:40,740 --> 02:52:47,960
Station, and basically came up with the idea of everything that day, and we were broadcasting

1925
02:52:47,960 --> 02:52:48,960
what in a couple weeks?

1926
02:52:48,960 --> 02:52:50,600
Yeah, didn't take long.

1927
02:52:50,600 --> 02:52:54,960
So basically it's just, you know, we were having fun with Under Station Live.

1928
02:52:54,960 --> 02:52:59,620
I know personally I was dying to sit behind the control panel for another show because

1929
02:52:59,620 --> 02:53:02,000
Travis always sat behind the control panel for that show.

1930
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:07,840
So I kind of wanted to do one where I could sit behind the control panel just because

1931
02:53:07,840 --> 02:53:10,720
I'd done it when I was doing college radio and stuff.

1932
02:53:10,720 --> 02:53:11,720
So it worked out.

1933
02:53:11,720 --> 02:53:14,720
And Jamie I knew was, you know, somebody I would want to do the radio show with because

1934
02:53:14,720 --> 02:53:17,160
she had all that experience on her station.

1935
02:53:17,160 --> 02:53:20,960
And also a vast knowledge of Bomani and video games in general.

1936
02:53:20,960 --> 02:53:22,800
So it's because I have no life.

1937
02:53:22,800 --> 02:53:23,980
She made a good partner for that.

1938
02:53:23,980 --> 02:53:26,900
And then Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out really good.

1939
02:53:26,900 --> 02:53:29,540
He won a host spot for perfect attendance.

1940
02:53:29,540 --> 02:53:30,540
He did.

1941
02:53:30,540 --> 02:53:31,540
Alright.

1942
02:53:31,540 --> 02:53:32,540
Um.

1943
02:53:32,540 --> 02:53:33,540
Dark Knight.

1944
02:53:33,540 --> 02:53:35,720
Here's a question for Orange Launch Radio.

1945
02:53:35,720 --> 02:53:40,220
Do you think that Nintendo DS's online gimmick will be worth it?

1946
02:53:40,220 --> 02:53:44,900
We're going to talk about this on the podcast this week, but the online gimmick-

1947
02:53:44,900 --> 02:53:45,900
Yeah!

1948
02:53:45,900 --> 02:53:51,140
Yeah, um, my short answer is yes.

1949
02:53:51,140 --> 02:53:54,620
I mean Animal Crossing on the internet. Hello.

1950
02:53:54,620 --> 02:53:58,340
Fuck yeah. PictoChat on the internet.

1951
02:53:58,340 --> 02:54:02,820
IR Scare.

1952
02:54:02,820 --> 02:54:06,660
That's all they can I say. That's all that I can say.

1953
02:54:06,660 --> 02:54:12,060
Dark Tetsuya says, here's what I meant to ask. What was everyone's first cata?

1954
02:54:12,060 --> 02:54:15,220
So in DDR, your first catastrophic song that you beat.

1955
02:54:15,220 --> 02:54:18,460
Jamie. My favorite one?

1956
02:54:18,460 --> 02:54:22,460
Your first. My first? Oh, my first was Hypnotic Crisis.

1957
02:54:22,460 --> 02:54:26,460
That was my first as well. Anybody else care to share?

1958
02:54:26,460 --> 02:54:30,460
I would say it was the same thing back then with Hypnotic Crisis.

1959
02:54:30,460 --> 02:54:34,460
Paranoia Eternal. Fucking easy.

1960
02:54:34,460 --> 02:54:39,460
Or if you count Paranoia Case Set and dropped out before it became Switch as a 9,

1961
02:54:39,460 --> 02:54:43,460
or Burn to Floor in Max 2.

1962
02:54:43,460 --> 02:54:48,420
the hell's up with that bird in the floor? Give me a break. That was weird. I remember

1963
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:51,280
talking about that before a long time ago on this show.

1964
02:54:51,280 --> 02:54:55,980
I can express one I'm working on, although it probably wasn't the best choice. My Summer

1965
02:54:55,980 --> 02:54:59,860
Love from like, Fourth Mix. My Summer Love I think was my second one, so that's not a

1966
02:54:59,860 --> 02:55:04,700
bad one to be trying I don't think. In my opinion. Or like, um, no wait, that's like

1967
02:55:04,700 --> 02:55:09,900
an eight, isn't it? Never mind. No, no, no. I was gonna say, uh, spin the disc, but I

1968
02:55:09,900 --> 02:55:11,480
I don't remember what number that is.

1969
02:55:11,480 --> 02:55:12,480
Alright.

1970
02:55:12,480 --> 02:55:13,480
Okay, that's Nate.

1971
02:55:13,480 --> 02:55:14,480
Never mind!

1972
02:55:14,480 --> 02:55:16,480
Alright, we gotta get, we're gonna burn through some of these other questions real fast, so

1973
02:55:16,480 --> 02:55:17,960
we gotta wrap up the show here.

1974
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:22,620
Mikolatov, Dear Ask Orange Lounge, seeing as how Sony doesn't seem to have as many ads

1975
02:55:22,620 --> 02:55:26,860
out for its PSP, but it's got so much hype behind it, do you think that it will be as

1976
02:55:26,860 --> 02:55:32,580
huge of a hit as the PS2?

1977
02:55:32,580 --> 02:55:36,180
When you phrase the question that way, will it be a bigger hit than the PS2, I have to

1978
02:55:36,180 --> 02:55:37,180
say no.

1979
02:55:37,180 --> 02:55:39,620
I think the PS2 is just untoppable in that regard.

1980
02:55:39,620 --> 02:55:44,240
I think it'll be a hit. I don't think the PSP is going to be a failure, like the N-Gage,

1981
02:55:44,240 --> 02:55:50,520
but I think it'll do respectably, is my big fat opinion. Any opinions from anyone else

1982
02:55:50,520 --> 02:55:51,520
on PSP?

1983
02:55:51,520 --> 02:55:57,760
We've got ours. Yeah, we're going to buy ours. It's not a big deal.

1984
02:55:57,760 --> 02:56:04,640
Price point's a little high for that. It'll be good though, I'm sure.

1985
02:56:04,640 --> 02:56:11,640
Legend of Zaku says, what was the worst Bamani-related drama you have ever seen?

1986
02:56:11,640 --> 02:56:20,320
MGL2. Remember MGL2? That was pretty bad when we had the guy who smashed food all over the

1987
02:56:20,320 --> 02:56:26,180
stage and stuff, and oh my god, weeks and weeks of, yeah, weeks and weeks of web board

1988
02:56:26,180 --> 02:56:31,780
posts after that. I just remember the local drama with certain

1989
02:56:31,780 --> 02:56:37,000
people yeah that was I'm like come to think of it a lot of the big Bahmani

1990
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:46,420
drama that I remember I was directly involved I know I know there's just yeah

1991
02:56:46,420 --> 02:56:49,900
I know when I think about Bahmani drama unfortunately I'm I think about the

1992
02:56:49,900 --> 02:56:54,500
stuff that impacted me the most which you know the two I think who were the

1993
02:56:54,500 --> 02:57:00,940
greatest causes I would say are no longer in the scene yeah true anything

1994
02:57:00,940 --> 02:57:06,020
you want to share explicit you've been to several attorneys I'll let the

1995
02:57:06,020 --> 02:57:13,060
forums explain everything sorta mm-hmm I'm not gonna say any names it's just

1996
02:57:13,060 --> 02:57:19,020
gonna let people find out about that yeah lemon lime jump says what do you

1997
02:57:19,020 --> 02:57:24,620
guys think of an orange lounge radio win amp skin hey if somebody wants to do one

1998
02:57:24,620 --> 02:57:29,220
that's awesome I don't I unfortunately have no artistic skill whatsoever but if

1999
02:57:29,220 --> 02:57:33,720
If somebody wants to make one and we approve of it, and we're pretty easily win-over-able,

2000
02:57:33,720 --> 02:57:36,860
we'll put it up in our downloads section on the website. I think that would be kind of

2001
02:57:36,860 --> 02:57:39,000
a neat thing to have, because I know a lot of people use Lamb.

2002
02:57:39,000 --> 02:57:43,000
As long as it works with the newest version or whatever, I'm cool with it too.

2003
02:57:43,000 --> 02:57:47,860
Yeah, it can work. Most of them do. So, any prospective artists out there that want to

2004
02:57:47,860 --> 02:57:51,780
try that, hey, we will totally support you in that. I think it's a good idea. I never

2005
02:57:51,780 --> 02:57:54,480
thought of that. That's a good thought.

2006
02:57:54,480 --> 02:57:59,480
And lastly, Illusion wants to know, why are people so lame?

2007
02:57:59,480 --> 02:58:02,020
Seriously, WTF.

2008
02:58:02,020 --> 02:58:03,880
Why are people so lame?

2009
02:58:03,880 --> 02:58:05,880
Their parents.

2010
02:58:05,880 --> 02:58:07,520
Yeah.

2011
02:58:07,520 --> 02:58:09,520
They were raised badly.

2012
02:58:09,520 --> 02:58:10,520
Alright.

2013
02:58:10,520 --> 02:58:16,480

2022
02:58:48,240 --> 02:58:51,200
Saturday which I need to yeah I thank you for reminding me about that because

2023
02:58:51,200 --> 02:58:57,260
I want to talk to these two about it after the show. So, okay, thank you. Yeah, I'll

2024
02:58:57,260 --> 02:59:02,420
tell you after the show. Anyway, final thought time. Sorry guys. It kind of seems, sometimes

2025
02:59:02,420 --> 02:59:05,580
I wish there was like a delay button that I could hit that would dump the street so

2026
02:59:05,580 --> 02:59:10,620
I could just say it and then dump it. Anyway, some day when we're real, real radio. Angel,

2027
02:59:10,620 --> 02:59:11,620
your final thought?

2028
02:59:11,620 --> 02:59:17,620
Um, Nintendo DS is going to be cool. Er.

2029
02:59:17,620 --> 02:59:20,620
Uh, explicit, your final thought?

2030
02:59:22,620 --> 02:59:24,620
33 days and still counting.

2031
02:59:24,620 --> 02:59:26,620
Oh, Jesus.

2032
02:59:26,620 --> 02:59:39,620
My final thought is, yes, chat room, there will be some outside the box this week, um, because, um, we've got Lanky Style and Rice Princess back, um, and they're going to be reviewing the Dear Friends concert from this last Monday, which is why they weren't able to make it this week.

2033
02:59:39,620 --> 02:59:44,800
this week. And there was some other stuff going on, which really exciting news, Orange

2034
02:59:44,800 --> 02:59:49,380
Lounge Radio is going to get some nice exposure, I can't say much more than that, we'll know

2035
02:59:49,380 --> 02:59:55,900
more as the week goes on. Uh, Loki. I better not hear any crap about next week, not this

2036
02:59:55,900 --> 03:00:01,900
week. It's Robot Chicken, which will feature a segment called Day in the Life of Mary-Kate

2037
03:00:01,900 --> 03:00:08,900
I was just gonna say, Jamie's being such a demobass.

2038
03:00:31,900 --> 03:00:36,660
Alright, Jamie, in response to that, I will give you the final word of the day.

2039
03:00:36,660 --> 03:00:37,660
Thanks you guys.

2040
03:00:37,660 --> 03:00:38,660
See you next week.

2041
03:00:38,660 --> 03:00:39,660
Jamie, the final word of the day.

2042
03:00:39,660 --> 03:00:40,660
So...

2043
03:00:40,660 --> 03:00:47,020
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2044
03:00:47,020 --> 03:00:51,180

2046
03:01:00,060 --> 03:01:05,060
And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2047
03:01:05,060 --> 03:01:08,060
I grew up in San Francisco.

2048
03:01:08,060 --> 03:01:14,060
I grew up in the midst of Polk Street, hanky code, poppers, San Francisco.

2049
03:01:14,060 --> 03:01:16,060
So that's like my childhood.

2050
03:01:16,060 --> 03:01:18,060
So I feel really comfortable.

2051
03:01:18,060 --> 03:01:21,060
My parents owned a bookstore on Polk Street.

2052
03:01:21,060 --> 03:01:26,060
And my mother was in charge of the gay porn.

2053
03:01:26,060 --> 03:01:28,060
Which is like crazy.

2054
03:01:28,060 --> 03:01:32,060
She would, like, pull out these books and show me to talk about it.

2055
03:01:33,060 --> 03:01:37,060
This book, this book, this called...

2056
03:01:37,060 --> 03:01:39,060
Ace Minister.

2057
03:01:44,060 --> 03:01:47,060
What is the Ace Minister?

2058
03:01:48,060 --> 03:01:51,060
What is that? I don't know where Ace...

2059
03:01:51,060 --> 03:01:53,060
Why do you do Ace Minister?

2060
03:01:53,060 --> 03:02:11,420
I thought this is a gay, the book for gay, because mommy don't know about the gay.

2061
03:02:11,420 --> 03:02:20,980
The gay, they like ass, they do, they like ass so much, you know, they like ass, and

2062
03:02:20,980 --> 03:02:31,980
but they like eggs too much. You know, you have to have eggs in moderation, you know what I mean?

2063
03:02:31,980 --> 03:02:50,300
Because if you have an age all the time, then it's not facial.

2064
03:02:50,300 --> 03:02:52,300
Then he's not special.

2065
03:02:58,300 --> 03:03:00,300
You know what mommy's saying?

2066
03:03:00,300 --> 03:03:04,300
There is a boy and his name is Paul.

2067
03:03:04,300 --> 03:03:06,300
And mommy like Paul.

2068
03:03:06,300 --> 03:03:11,300
He's a nice boy but he's gay and he only like two things.

2069
03:03:11,300 --> 03:03:14,300
He like ass and Judy Garland.

2070
03:03:14,300 --> 03:03:16,300
And that's all.

2071
03:03:20,300 --> 03:03:23,300
And what kind of life is it like that?

2072
03:03:24,300 --> 03:03:26,300
That's all.

2073
03:03:27,300 --> 03:03:31,300
You know, there's the earth and the edge over the rainbow, and that's all.

2074
03:03:32,300 --> 03:03:33,300
What kind of life?

2075
03:03:34,300 --> 03:03:36,300
I don't know why they do this.

2076
03:03:38,300 --> 03:03:41,300
Well, I have to look at this boo with the ace mister.

2077
03:03:41,300 --> 03:03:45,280
I'm going to look at his book.

2078
03:03:45,280 --> 03:03:47,280
I'm going to look at it.

2079
03:03:47,280 --> 03:03:53,840
Look at mommy, I'm going to look at A's face for now.

2080
03:03:53,840 --> 03:03:57,440
Look at mommy, look at mommy.

2081
03:03:57,440 --> 03:03:59,460
A's face.

2082
03:03:59,460 --> 03:04:23,460
I was shocked, you know, I was so shocked, it was, it was just A's right away, you know.

2083
03:04:23,460 --> 03:04:40,460
I thought they would be table of contents, didn't they?

2084
03:04:40,460 --> 03:04:41,460
Thank you very much everybody!

2085
03:04:41,460 --> 03:04:42,460
You're the best!

2086
03:04:42,460 --> 03:04:59,820
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2087
03:05:12,460 --> 03:05:14,460
You

2088
03:05:42,460 --> 03:06:12,440
Alright, that's going to do it for Orange Laundrio tonight.

2089
03:06:12,440 --> 03:06:18,860
you guys. Thanks so, so much for tuning in and listening and supporting us, and voting

2090
03:06:18,860 --> 03:06:23,660
for us in different places when we ask you guys to and stuff. We love the O.L. Army.

2091
03:06:23,660 --> 03:06:29,660
We keep doing this for you guys. You're awesome. You help make this interactive show what it

2092
03:06:29,660 --> 03:06:33,620
is. So we appreciate that, you guys. Have a great night. What's gonna happen now is

2093
03:06:33,620 --> 03:06:37,940
you are gonna get disconnected from the stream, but just reconnect in like 15 to 20 seconds,

2094
03:06:37,940 --> 03:06:41,900
and you will resume hearing a bunch of DDR, 2DX, and Dance Media favorites. Have a good

2095
03:06:41,900 --> 03:06:42,900
Go on, everybody.

2096
03:06:42,900 --> 03:06:43,740
Good night.
