[SPEAKER_19]: Now lung-free.

19
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, no lung butter this week.

20
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:34,238
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, some, but I'm mostly better.

21
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:35,518
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good to me.

22
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:44,420
[SPEAKER_03]: And in this corner, saving our sound at the last second here tonight, we are having some major sound issues just 30 seconds ago.

00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,040
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to Loki.

24
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,020
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.

25
00:03:49,061 --> 00:03:50,881
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, and also joining us tonight...

26
00:03:52,071 --> 00:04:00,236
[SPEAKER_03]: A veteran of our program, a veteran guest, she's been down in the trenches and she knows how to butter the host of the show up.

00:04:00,576 --> 00:04:02,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello to DDR Angel.

28
00:04:02,818 --> 00:04:03,158
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello.

29
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,200
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

30
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:11,803
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it should be another fun-filled show tonight.

31
00:04:12,464 --> 00:04:15,506
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got, you know, all the regular stuff you like to hear.

32
00:04:16,066 --> 00:04:19,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Our weeks, our day, cage match, and who knows what else.

33
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:23,057
[SPEAKER_03]: Possibly some Bomani news and all that fun stuff as well.

34
00:04:23,617 --> 00:04:26,297
[SPEAKER_03]: We will get into that when we come back from a quick break.

35
00:04:27,377 --> 00:04:32,398
[SPEAKER_03]: And this break, I don't really have an idea for music that I want to hear in particular.

36
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:35,319
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we'll just kind of do some Bomani randomness.

37
00:04:36,799 --> 00:04:40,060
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start it off with some Thomas Howard Lichtenstein.

38
00:04:43,001 --> 00:04:44,381
[SPEAKER_03]: La Senorita, we'll be back after this.

39
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:23,761
[SPEAKER_11]: and many more.

40
00:05:50,635 --> 00:06:13,493
[SPEAKER_11]: Feeling good over you, like you knew she would When she smiles, it's like the sun's shining on your face Falling and stretching, the land of the lame And she's a hot one, California, hula señorita California, hula señorita, hula señorita

41
00:07:43,719 --> 00:07:49,481
I was the happiest guy, that's what everyone said

42
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,757
Thank you for watching.

43
00:09:06,604 --> 00:09:07,104
Thank you.

44
00:09:53,188 --> 00:09:54,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Whoops, we didn't have another song queued up there.

45
00:09:54,990 --> 00:09:58,574
[SPEAKER_03]: We were trying to queue up one more song and made a little bit of a mistake there.

46
00:09:59,555 --> 00:10:01,317
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens, you know, stuff happens.

47
00:10:01,337 --> 00:10:02,699
[SPEAKER_19]: So Ballad For You was a mistake.

48
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,962
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Ballad For You was not a mistake.

49
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:08,125
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like this next song, The Torture Will Continue Here with Thomas Howard.

50
00:10:08,205 --> 00:10:09,507
[SPEAKER_03]: One more song, we'll be back after this.

51
00:10:38,935 --> 00:10:40,163
[SPEAKER_11]: Such a special day

52
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:55,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Orange Lounge Radio, Bomani Music, and more.

53
00:11:57,422 --> 00:11:59,404
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

54
00:11:59,464 --> 00:12:01,446
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you enjoyed that break full of Thomas Howard.

55
00:12:03,752 --> 00:12:05,994
[SPEAKER_19]: He's named after a small country in Europe.

56
00:12:06,014 --> 00:12:06,074
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay!

57
00:12:26,681 --> 00:12:30,942
[SPEAKER_19]: If they hate us so much, why are they listening?

58
00:12:31,382 --> 00:12:34,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they know the next break will be something decent.

59
00:12:34,363 --> 00:12:36,844
[SPEAKER_03]: We play things from the entire Bomani spectrum.

60
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:39,585
[SPEAKER_19]: It'll be a break of nothing, but I love that feeling.

61
00:12:40,665 --> 00:12:45,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Little do they realize it's the Thomas Howard show today, and they won't be getting anything else.

62
00:12:45,967 --> 00:12:49,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I swear to God, I will be playing Forever Sunshine next break.

63
00:12:51,889 --> 00:12:52,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob?

64
00:12:52,069 --> 00:12:52,149
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

65
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:53,947
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

66
00:12:55,648 --> 00:12:55,828
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

67
00:12:55,988 --> 00:12:57,329
[SPEAKER_19]: Play the song and I will kill you.

68
00:12:57,789 --> 00:13:01,091
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's actually damn good reason to be playing Forever Sunshine next break.

69
00:13:01,211 --> 00:13:02,151
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll get into that later.

70
00:13:03,492 --> 00:13:04,433
[SPEAKER_19]: I will kill you with a ferret.

71
00:13:05,813 --> 00:13:06,934
[SPEAKER_19]: I will kill you in a house.

72
00:13:07,134 --> 00:13:08,194
[SPEAKER_19]: I will kill you with a mouse.

73
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:10,356
[SPEAKER_03]: Will you kill me in a bus?

74
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:17,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't this like six weeks ago when we got into this Dr. Seuss show?

75
00:13:21,727 --> 00:13:23,848
[SPEAKER_17]: Dr. Redfish Bluefish and you got a deal.

76
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:25,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

77
00:13:25,569 --> 00:13:26,870
[SPEAKER_02]: Would you piss on a train?

78
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:27,731
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

79
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:27,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

80
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:28,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop.

81
00:13:30,953 --> 00:13:37,477
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, I was going to say that I liked El Mullet's statement in our chat room over at www.orangehunterradio.com.

82
00:13:37,497 --> 00:13:38,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Click on chat.

83
00:13:38,437 --> 00:13:40,498
[SPEAKER_03]: El Mullet says, I love this station.

84
00:13:40,558 --> 00:13:42,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Giving the fans what they don't want.

85
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,081
[SPEAKER_03]: That's us.

86
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:47,262
[SPEAKER_03]: F.E.A.T.

87
00:13:47,282 --> 00:13:47,442
[SPEAKER_03]: Mania FM

88
00:14:08,453 --> 00:14:09,654
[SPEAKER_03]: I only played once this week.

89
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:10,494
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually played DDR today.

90
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:42,299
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, I was playing Controller on Ultramix 2 on Xbox Live, but I was actually having fun.

91
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,621
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'll get into that later.

92
00:14:44,861 --> 00:14:50,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's start off tonight's show as we always do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, starting off with the lovely DarkSakura.

93
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,206
[SPEAKER_19]: I spent the whole week on codeine.

94
00:14:53,187 --> 00:15:00,272
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to the doctor, and he gave me some lovely drugs, except I misread the label in my sickness and read teaspoon as tablespoon.

95
00:15:00,972 --> 00:15:03,094
[SPEAKER_19]: So all Monday at work I was taking this

96
00:15:04,515 --> 00:15:09,036
[SPEAKER_19]: with codeine syrup at basically triple doses four times a day.

97
00:15:09,997 --> 00:15:12,017
[SPEAKER_19]: I was high as a kite and feeling a little pain.

98
00:15:14,158 --> 00:15:14,958
[SPEAKER_19]: I was very happy.

99
00:15:15,238 --> 00:15:16,738
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, kids, drugs are bad.

100
00:15:16,938 --> 00:15:18,819
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

101
00:15:20,599 --> 00:15:22,840
[SPEAKER_03]: But... It's not endorsed drug use.

102
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:23,640
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes, we do.

103
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,440
[SPEAKER_19]: What are you talking about?

104
00:15:26,501 --> 00:15:31,802
[SPEAKER_03]: We do endorse burping off the... You endorse recreational Waltussin use?

105
00:15:32,597 --> 00:15:33,777
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't take Waltussin anymore.

106
00:15:34,738 --> 00:15:35,598
[SPEAKER_19]: It's got sugar in it.

107
00:15:36,218 --> 00:15:36,338
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh.

108
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,259
[SPEAKER_19]: But they make sugar-free cola.

109
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,981
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know why things that aren't usually funny are funny tonight.

110
00:15:46,041 --> 00:15:48,121
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe I'm high on codeine.

111
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:48,721
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

112
00:15:51,522 --> 00:15:54,383
[SPEAKER_03]: You sound like you're still coughing up a little bit of lung butter over there.

113
00:15:55,323 --> 00:15:57,964
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, but it's a good thing because I have a voice finally.

114
00:15:58,324 --> 00:15:58,584
[SPEAKER_19]: Sort of.

115
00:15:58,724 --> 00:15:59,104
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.

116
00:15:59,714 --> 00:16:02,257
[SPEAKER_19]: I could sing with my CD player today, it was great.

117
00:16:02,297 --> 00:16:05,460
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight you don't sound like Grandma Orange Lounge.

118
00:16:07,862 --> 00:16:08,923
[SPEAKER_19]: I got a pair of three.

119
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:11,126
[SPEAKER_19]: Sure did.

120
00:16:12,607 --> 00:16:17,212
[SPEAKER_19]: But, you know, the week was pretty much normal crap.

121
00:16:17,472 --> 00:16:19,774
[SPEAKER_19]: I, of course, didn't go to the gym, but I did go yesterday.

122
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:21,356
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to spin class.

123
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:30,284
[SPEAKER_19]: and I was very sad because the teacher who I wanted to teach a spin class wasn't teaching it because she might be sick with other issues and so I'm really worried.

124
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:35,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But my friend... I just ferreted Jamie's laptop.

125
00:16:36,326 --> 00:16:38,147
[SPEAKER_19]: You touch the precious and you die.

126
00:16:39,188 --> 00:16:39,408
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

127
00:16:39,668 --> 00:16:40,808
[SPEAKER_19]: You go to hell and you die!

128
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:42,509
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

129
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:44,530
[SPEAKER_19]: Rob just picked his nose.

130
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not pick my nose, I scratched my nose.

131
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:54,522
[SPEAKER_03]: If the webcam phased over here, I'd demand an instant replay.

132
00:16:56,003 --> 00:17:00,026
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, too bad that you'd have to be picking your nose for like a minute straight for that to work.

133
00:17:02,347 --> 00:17:04,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, you really did futz with that mic.

134
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:05,629
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good and loud now.

135
00:17:07,511 --> 00:17:15,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell you, it's probably just because pulling chords out over the audio board there

136
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:22,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Every now and then a cord gets stuck on a knob, and then, you know, the knob turns, and then the audio gets all fucked up.

137
00:17:23,282 --> 00:17:25,303
[SPEAKER_02]: Needs to be, like, in a glass case or something.

138
00:17:25,663 --> 00:17:27,543
[SPEAKER_17]: Loki has his magic gummy bears again.

139
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:28,824
[SPEAKER_17]: Dun-dun-dun!

140
00:17:30,064 --> 00:17:39,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, if you guys were listening to the podcast this last week, Loki was, like, turned down to, like, 20% level or something, but it was pleasant, because his anger was subdued.

141
00:17:40,543 --> 00:17:41,963
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't like subduing.

142
00:17:42,003 --> 00:17:42,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

143
00:17:42,623 --> 00:17:43,064
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Jamie.

144
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: I keep interrupting you.

145
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,624
[SPEAKER_19]: I still have to tell you about my damn week.

146
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:46,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.

147
00:17:47,065 --> 00:17:51,666
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why... For those people wondering why this segment takes so damn long, this is why right here.

148
00:17:52,526 --> 00:17:54,686
[SPEAKER_19]: It's called We Digress.

149
00:17:56,047 --> 00:17:56,347
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway.

150
00:17:57,647 --> 00:18:00,788
[SPEAKER_19]: I hung out with my friend Melody yesterday who is not Shark's girl.

151
00:18:02,328 --> 00:18:08,089
[SPEAKER_19]: She is a friend of mine who I worked with at the evil student loan company.

152
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,330
[SPEAKER_19]: And she...

153
00:18:10,769 --> 00:18:17,754
[SPEAKER_19]: Met her fiancé through work, and he lives in Delaware, so she's moving to Delaware next month.

154
00:18:18,854 --> 00:18:21,096
[SPEAKER_21]: We're in Delaware!

155
00:18:21,196 --> 00:18:22,216
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, knock it off.

156
00:18:23,177 --> 00:18:32,283
[SPEAKER_19]: But anyway, this is the last chance I'd really get to hang out with her, so we went to see Constantine yesterday, which I actually liked.

157
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:39,227
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've even read a little bit of the Hellblazer comics, so where it was a bit different, I actually liked it as a movie.

158
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:39,888
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pretty cool.

159
00:18:41,312 --> 00:18:51,498
[SPEAKER_19]: I think that's how I like movies that just totally screw with theology and, you know, that's also, I guess, the reason why I like Angel Sanctuary, too.

160
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,221
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, we saw that.

161
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:58,983
[SPEAKER_19]: I went to her apartment to meet her cat, Simon.

162
00:18:59,123 --> 00:19:00,524
[SPEAKER_19]: She went to my apartment to meet Shermie.

163
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:03,546
[SPEAKER_19]: She took two pictures of me and five pictures of Shermie.

164
00:19:07,941 --> 00:19:13,563
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyway, I took her to meet Dan, and Dan did his stuff he was working.

165
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,823
[SPEAKER_19]: Then we went to Chevy's.

166
00:19:16,263 --> 00:19:18,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he manage to sell any ignition pads?

167
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:19,404
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know.

168
00:19:19,444 --> 00:19:19,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't care.

169
00:19:21,245 --> 00:19:22,005
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't keep up with that.

170
00:19:22,025 --> 00:19:23,125
[SPEAKER_19]: He's off to an inventory tonight.

171
00:19:23,405 --> 00:19:24,626
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, okay.

172
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:28,287
[SPEAKER_19]: But we went to Chevy's, and then went to Cheesecake Factory.

173
00:19:28,327 --> 00:19:29,727
[SPEAKER_19]: I decided to make yesterday my cheat day.

174
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,828
[SPEAKER_19]: So the box of Samoas is going to wait until my birthday, because that's my next cheat day.

175
00:19:35,529 --> 00:19:36,769
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm having two cheat days next month.

176
00:19:39,536 --> 00:19:46,440
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, then we went back, um, and Dan came home when we were hanging out at my place because I was burning off a copy of Battle Royale for her.

177
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:56,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, and, uh, we watched The Ring and, uh, the part of, uh, An Evening with Kevin Smith.

178
00:19:56,424 --> 00:19:57,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't The Ring 2 out this week?

179
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,786
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't know, isn't it?

180
00:19:59,806 --> 00:20:00,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, this Friday.

181
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:01,667
[SPEAKER_02]: Hot.

182
00:20:01,707 --> 00:20:03,007
[SPEAKER_19]: Holy shit, I have to go.

183
00:20:03,027 --> 00:20:04,388
[SPEAKER_19]: Because,

184
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:30,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm looking to see, I want to see because I heard they were trying to incorporate some stuff from the books and I really like the books over the movies because the books go in such a completely different direction which I kind of wish the movies had but it would not have been realistic so I'm really curious and otherwise today's been kind of oh yeah today I actually was outside taking pictures of nature

185
00:20:31,428 --> 00:20:36,851
[SPEAKER_19]: Because for my Photoshop class, I have to do a composite of three pictures into a fantasy setting.

186
00:20:38,172 --> 00:20:41,594
[SPEAKER_19]: And I've got one of a bridge and two other ones.

187
00:20:42,614 --> 00:20:43,255
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to play with them.

188
00:20:43,295 --> 00:20:44,716
[SPEAKER_19]: I got my pictures from Alabama developed.

189
00:20:45,436 --> 00:20:47,357
[SPEAKER_19]: I managed to spend $75 at Walgreens.

190
00:20:48,518 --> 00:20:50,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they let you do digital photography in photo classes now?

191
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:53,521
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when I was in college, you had to use the old cameras.

192
00:20:53,641 --> 00:20:54,581
[SPEAKER_19]: This isn't a photo class.

193
00:20:54,881 --> 00:20:55,842
[SPEAKER_19]: This is Photoshop.

194
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:56,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

195
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:57,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that makes sense.

196
00:20:58,663 --> 00:21:00,465
[SPEAKER_19]: And he doesn't care how we get him as long as we get him.

197
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:01,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you.

198
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:07,797
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... But... That's pretty much it.

199
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:10,057
[SPEAKER_19]: I got to hang out with Dan and Julie today.

200
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,798
[SPEAKER_19]: And then Dan had to go to work and I went back home.

201
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:14,898
[SPEAKER_19]: Ah!

202
00:21:16,579 --> 00:21:16,939
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

203
00:21:17,439 --> 00:21:17,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?

204
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,600
[SPEAKER_19]: I like fire.

205
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:20,620
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

206
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,281
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's it for your week and your day.

207
00:21:22,921 --> 00:21:23,361
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

208
00:21:23,461 --> 00:21:23,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

209
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:24,401
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm done.

210
00:21:24,601 --> 00:21:25,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on then.

211
00:21:25,121 --> 00:21:25,861
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how was your week?

212
00:21:25,901 --> 00:21:26,282
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

213
00:21:27,482 --> 00:21:27,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

214
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:28,994
[SPEAKER_02]: It was okay.

215
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:30,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't do much.

216
00:21:30,315 --> 00:21:33,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I just, um, played Final Fantasy XI.

217
00:21:34,137 --> 00:21:36,639
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, Attic.

218
00:21:37,179 --> 00:21:37,879
[SPEAKER_02]: What else did I do?

219
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,100
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there was other crap.

220
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:45,604
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I went and saw, um, what was it, uh, Robots yesterday.

221
00:21:46,064 --> 00:21:47,025
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was okay.

222
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:48,425
[SPEAKER_02]: It was free.

223
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:49,766
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a lot of popcorn.

224
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:50,667
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was all good.

225
00:21:51,947 --> 00:21:56,330
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, um, yesterday we watched, um, SpongeBob SquarePants.

226
00:22:03,492 --> 00:22:09,637
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a goopy goober, yeah You're a goopy goober, yeah That movie was so random, it's just...

227
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:13,534
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know.

228
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:19,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I was kind of a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants before, but now, like, oh my god, he's so awesome.

229
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:22,641
[SPEAKER_19]: I can safely say I've never, ever, ever, ever seen any.

230
00:22:22,721 --> 00:22:23,822
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to see the movie.

231
00:22:24,042 --> 00:22:24,402
[SPEAKER_02]: It is awesome.

232
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:25,283
[SPEAKER_19]: And Blackout refused to.

233
00:22:25,383 --> 00:22:29,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I hate SpongeBob SquarePants, but the movie was good.

234
00:22:29,446 --> 00:22:30,147
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked the movie.

235
00:22:31,129 --> 00:22:34,951
[SPEAKER_02]: I find Spongebob Squarepants to be completely retarded and just annoying.

236
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:39,253
[SPEAKER_02]: And the movie was just, it was so different from the show.

237
00:22:39,413 --> 00:22:44,755
[SPEAKER_02]: It was kind of weird, because it was actually, you know, very random, sort of like... It was what Nellie said, it was a stoner movie.

238
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:46,516
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a stoner movie.

239
00:22:46,956 --> 00:22:52,218
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, and it was like, they had so many homosexual innuendos in that movie.

240
00:22:52,658 --> 00:22:56,180
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, especially the ending, where they do like a kiss type ending.

241
00:22:57,253 --> 00:23:00,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if there was a Kiss movie, I'm sure there was.

242
00:23:00,856 --> 00:23:08,962
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's totally the Kiss ending, and then Patrick is wearing fishnet stockings.

243
00:23:09,062 --> 00:23:10,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, and stilettos.

244
00:23:10,584 --> 00:23:11,504
[SPEAKER_02]: And stilettos.

245
00:23:13,065 --> 00:23:14,006
[SPEAKER_03]: And stripper boots.

246
00:23:14,547 --> 00:23:15,447
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just weird.

247
00:23:16,268 --> 00:23:19,510
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it was kind of funny.

248
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:20,931
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just completely different.

249
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:24,294
[SPEAKER_02]: And then earlier in the week I had watched White Noise.

250
00:23:25,954 --> 00:23:29,816
[SPEAKER_02]: And that movie was, yeah, it was weird.

251
00:23:31,156 --> 00:23:35,818
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just so gonna... It just, like, had an ending that made no sense in that movie.

252
00:23:35,858 --> 00:23:48,504
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you're leading up, you find there's this guy, you know, and there's these three ghosts that have been killing people, and then, you know, the resolution to the movie, the ghosts break every bone in this guy's body and throw him off a building.

253
00:23:48,584 --> 00:23:48,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

254
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:51,185
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, gee, thanks!

255
00:23:51,505 --> 00:23:51,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.

256
00:23:54,172 --> 00:23:54,752
[SPEAKER_02]: Will sell soul for Gil

257
00:24:26,266 --> 00:24:28,807
[SPEAKER_02]: I just did nothing, like usual.

258
00:24:29,247 --> 00:24:32,248
[SPEAKER_02]: Still waiting for my damn interview for the game sales position.

259
00:24:34,288 --> 00:24:34,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Still waiting.

260
00:24:37,129 --> 00:24:37,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

261
00:24:38,229 --> 00:24:38,630
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.

262
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:39,810
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

263
00:24:39,970 --> 00:24:40,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, how was your week?

264
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:41,250
[SPEAKER_03]: How was your day?

265
00:24:41,710 --> 00:24:41,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, wait.

266
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:44,471
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, before we get into that, I actually got a clip.

267
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:45,451
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, Angel.

268
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:48,072
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a clip of that song, Girls Butts.

269
00:24:48,372 --> 00:24:50,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Miklatov somehow had it, and he sent it over to me.

270
00:24:56,563 --> 00:24:57,564
[SPEAKER_01]: Aw yeah!

271
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:58,004
[SPEAKER_08]: Aw yeah!

272
00:25:23,450 --> 00:25:24,291
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish this week never existed.

273
00:25:24,311 --> 00:25:24,531
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

274
00:25:24,571 --> 00:25:24,731
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

275
00:25:24,751 --> 00:25:25,531
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish it never existed.

276
00:25:46,437 --> 00:25:49,978
[SPEAKER_17]: Monday through Wednesday was just fine.

277
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:53,299
[SPEAKER_17]: And all that good stuff.

278
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:59,101
[SPEAKER_17]: Went to school and worked a little and just all that other stuff.

279
00:26:00,542 --> 00:26:01,842
[SPEAKER_17]: And then Thursday was school.

280
00:26:02,663 --> 00:26:06,564
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I come to find out when I come home as soon as I sat down for my computer.

281
00:26:08,086 --> 00:26:30,474
[SPEAKER_17]: that my friend had passed away and it's one of the guys that I knew two years in the DJ field you know on the radio and stuff and let's just say since Thursday it's been kind of a screwed up four days and sleep's been a joke and just you know

282
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:42,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Me and my other friends have been hanging around there and just comforting each other and just you know stuff that you need to do when somebody passes away and just I haven't felt this much like

283
00:26:43,425 --> 00:26:47,651
[SPEAKER_17]: I just had a really hard week or at least the last four days.

284
00:27:02,392 --> 00:27:18,477
[SPEAKER_17]: It's getting better, but, you know, there's just little things that remind you of this, you know, somebody, like, you'll be walking down the street and you'll see somebody wear a shirt, and that shirt, like, reminds you of the person that you just lost, and just little stuff like that.

285
00:27:19,157 --> 00:27:27,620
[SPEAKER_17]: And so, yeah, I've been grieving all week, except for the first three days of the week, so it's been pretty shitty week.

286
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,181
[SPEAKER_17]: And I really don't really want to think about it.

287
00:27:30,841 --> 00:27:31,561
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, that's it.

288
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry to hear about it, and I hope things get better for you and everything.

289
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:40,792
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, how the hell do I follow that?

290
00:27:41,633 --> 00:27:41,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel?

291
00:27:43,334 --> 00:27:44,275
[SPEAKER_17]: Being here helps.

292
00:27:44,535 --> 00:27:46,417
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we should play the Girls Butts songs again.

293
00:27:46,517 --> 00:27:47,138
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, jeez.

294
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:52,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, maybe if I play the Girls Butts song again, Angel will feel a little better.

295
00:28:05,031 --> 00:28:05,431
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

296
00:28:33,222 --> 00:28:35,023
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Girls Butts get rid of your cough?

297
00:28:35,343 --> 00:28:36,644
[SPEAKER_19]: I guess so, wow.

298
00:28:37,044 --> 00:28:39,045
[SPEAKER_01]: Girls Butts has healed me!

299
00:28:39,445 --> 00:28:42,626
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt the power of the Girls Butts!

300
00:28:43,167 --> 00:28:44,547
[SPEAKER_01]: Praise the Lord!

301
00:28:44,627 --> 00:28:46,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, this song cures cancer.

302
00:28:46,948 --> 00:28:51,830
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't tell me that Orange Lounge doesn't better your life, everybody.

303
00:29:01,044 --> 00:29:01,905
[SPEAKER_03]: My week and my day.

304
00:29:02,285 --> 00:29:03,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Shit, what did I do?

305
00:29:03,205 --> 00:29:05,247
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, not a whole lot.

306
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:06,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing that exciting.

307
00:29:06,768 --> 00:29:10,010
[SPEAKER_03]: I also watched the SpongeBob SquarePants movie Friday night, which I thought was awesome.

308
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:13,412
[SPEAKER_03]: And also watched this other movie last night, which was very odd.

309
00:29:13,452 --> 00:29:14,753
[SPEAKER_03]: It was called The Final Cut.

310
00:29:14,993 --> 00:29:16,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Cut with Robin Williams.

311
00:29:16,935 --> 00:29:19,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, I'd never heard of this movie in theaters.

312
00:29:20,057 --> 00:29:20,937
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very limited.

313
00:29:21,318 --> 00:29:22,959
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very, very limited, apparently.

314
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:25,240
[SPEAKER_03]: So, there was that.

315
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um...

316
00:29:28,846 --> 00:29:34,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that movie was very... Well, obviously, it's not what you'd expect from a Robin Williams movie, because it was very dark.

317
00:29:34,709 --> 00:29:36,690
[SPEAKER_17]: He also did the one-hour photo.

318
00:29:36,710 --> 00:29:36,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

319
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:37,850
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that one.

320
00:29:37,870 --> 00:29:38,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That one's weird.

321
00:29:38,511 --> 00:29:38,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

322
00:29:39,491 --> 00:29:42,353
[SPEAKER_03]: So, all sorts of, like, very unsettling movies there.

323
00:29:44,733 --> 00:29:46,054
[SPEAKER_03]: But, yeah, it was different.

324
00:29:46,154 --> 00:29:46,795
[SPEAKER_03]: But I liked it.

325
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,316
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a thought-provoking movie.

326
00:29:48,336 --> 00:29:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of made you go, hmm, that's interesting.

327
00:29:51,299 --> 00:29:53,581
[SPEAKER_03]: Friday night I went out to the bar, and it was cool.

328
00:29:54,362 --> 00:29:58,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there was this guy that thought it was cool that I played games, so we talked for a little while.

329
00:29:58,606 --> 00:30:01,308
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was weird, though, because he's not... He's kind of...

330
00:30:02,949 --> 00:30:04,390
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a big Nintendo supporter.

331
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:07,891
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to talk to him about why I believe the GameCube is awesome and all that.

332
00:30:07,971 --> 00:30:09,092
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was interesting.

333
00:30:10,132 --> 00:30:14,414
[SPEAKER_03]: And outside of that, you know, just same old stuff.

334
00:30:15,614 --> 00:30:18,555
[SPEAKER_03]: Went out to karaoke earlier this week because I'm a total karaoke whore.

335
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:18,955
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it.

336
00:30:19,656 --> 00:30:21,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I went twice this week.

337
00:30:21,716 --> 00:30:23,077
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a big karaoke whore I am.

338
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:27,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I went on Monday night when it's not the usual karaoke guy that I'm used to.

339
00:30:27,941 --> 00:30:28,842
[SPEAKER_03]: It just wasn't the same.

340
00:30:29,223 --> 00:30:30,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It really wasn't the same.

341
00:30:31,905 --> 00:30:32,406
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that.

342
00:30:33,186 --> 00:30:33,707
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it for me.

343
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:36,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's see.

344
00:30:39,032 --> 00:30:41,054
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into another break here.

345
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:55,605
[SPEAKER_03]: and in this break we're going to play two songs and these two songs have something in common and I'll talk about what these songs have in common when we come back after this you're listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back

346
00:32:51,192 --> 00:32:52,974
Thank you for watching!

347
00:33:16,926 --> 00:33:17,428
DarkSakura.com

348
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:40,626
[SPEAKER_11]: Music, Music, Music, Music, Music,

349
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Those two songs have something in common.

350
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:08,998
[SPEAKER_03]: If you haven't figured it out yet, we'll play two more songs that should give you a little bit of a hint.

351
00:35:10,522 --> 00:35:23,385
I didn't notice the light with this beam Fly away to fantasy Feeling the insolence Until we reach eternity

352
00:36:04,501 --> 00:36:05,263
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you feel it?

353
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:29,552
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks for watching!

354
00:37:23,668 --> 00:37:24,290
[SPEAKER_11]: You can feel it.

355
00:37:54,108 --> 00:38:01,492
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

356
00:38:01,512 --> 00:38:01,692
[SPEAKER_18]: I... what?

357
00:38:20,163 --> 00:38:24,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, wait, what's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

358
00:38:26,564 --> 00:38:29,265
[SPEAKER_22]: Orange Lounge Radio, listen or die!

359
00:38:34,306 --> 00:38:46,088
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't had an excuse to play that one in a while, but since you guys were talking about, you know, The Ring 2 coming out soon, and you talking about, you know, you watching The Ring this week and stuff.

360
00:38:46,108 --> 00:38:47,869
[SPEAKER_19]: You can totally see up my nose in this picture.

361
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:49,549
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that makes for great radio.

362
00:38:51,389 --> 00:38:52,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I like Dan's smile.

363
00:38:52,649 --> 00:38:54,950
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, ah.

364
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:59,011
[SPEAKER_03]: He looks like Spongebob did in that movie when he got all happy.

365
00:38:59,391 --> 00:39:01,171
[SPEAKER_19]: Do not compare my man to Spongebob.

366
00:39:02,892 --> 00:39:03,212
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

367
00:39:03,272 --> 00:39:10,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so if you didn't figure it out, Forever Sunshine and Regret, a song from Keyboard Mania that we played in there, too.

368
00:39:10,993 --> 00:39:11,834
[SPEAKER_03]: You may not have recognized that.

369
00:39:12,174 --> 00:39:15,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are two songs that are assumably in the next song pack.

370
00:39:15,794 --> 00:39:18,515
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we haven't heard anything official yet, but...

371
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:20,209
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

372
00:39:38,425 --> 00:39:40,807
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are just pretty much assuming they've got them right.

373
00:39:41,147 --> 00:39:44,450
[SPEAKER_03]: So Regret and Forever Sunshine, two of the songs that are going to be in there.

374
00:39:44,490 --> 00:39:47,112
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll play some of the other songs a little bit more later.

375
00:39:47,152 --> 00:39:52,396
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, I Feel the Junk, Circuit Mix, and More Deep were songs that were in the last song pack.

376
00:39:52,416 --> 00:39:53,137
[SPEAKER_03]: So a little hint for you.

377
00:39:53,497 --> 00:39:58,301
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, boys and girls, you get to download Forever Sunshine in the next song pack for DDR.

378
00:39:58,601 --> 00:39:59,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't that make you excited?

379
00:40:02,244 --> 00:40:02,384
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

380
00:40:04,046 --> 00:40:04,426
[SPEAKER_19]: Yay.

381
00:40:06,548 --> 00:40:06,888
[SPEAKER_19]: We.

382
00:40:07,749 --> 00:40:07,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Now,

383
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:09,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

384
00:40:09,065 --> 00:40:09,225
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello?

385
00:40:09,245 --> 00:40:09,365
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?

386
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:39,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, wow, you're really quiet right now, but that's alright.

387
00:40:39,541 --> 00:40:41,062
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Rob on Orange Lounge Radio.

388
00:40:42,203 --> 00:40:42,843
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, what's up?

389
00:40:43,163 --> 00:40:43,704
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a lot.

390
00:40:44,124 --> 00:40:48,466
[SPEAKER_03]: So, tell me about Forever Sunshine being in the next song pack.

391
00:40:50,227 --> 00:40:51,748
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you mean tell you about it?

392
00:40:51,848 --> 00:40:56,451
[SPEAKER_07]: It's there, and it's awesome, and everybody who hates it should just go and die.

393
00:40:58,552 --> 00:41:00,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Why did you put, why Forever Sunshine?

394
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:01,473
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this your fault?

395
00:41:02,174 --> 00:41:02,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you do this?

396
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:03,534
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's my fault.

397
00:41:03,874 --> 00:41:04,755
[SPEAKER_03]: How is this your fault?

398
00:41:06,021 --> 00:41:08,962
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I picked a whole bunch of songs that I personally like.

399
00:41:09,322 --> 00:41:11,442
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't care if the other people liked them or not.

400
00:41:11,982 --> 00:41:17,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Forever Sunshine, and like Follow Laika, That's All Me Right There, OGC, Regret.

401
00:41:18,343 --> 00:41:21,984
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are songs I like, and I was like, well, they'd be cool for DDR, so I suggested them.

402
00:41:22,244 --> 00:41:25,324
[SPEAKER_01]: But Forever Sunshine was already in DDR, and it sucks!

403
00:41:26,624 --> 00:41:29,365
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, well, it was that, or you could have let them move.

404
00:41:30,345 --> 00:41:31,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd almost rather have let them move.

405
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:33,086
[SPEAKER_03]: Would it be like a junk circuit mix?

406
00:41:33,106 --> 00:41:34,346
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't count now, do you?

407
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:35,446
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess not.

408
00:41:36,869 --> 00:41:37,629
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mad at you.

409
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,770
[SPEAKER_07]: That's okay.

410
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:43,012
[SPEAKER_07]: You can take it out on me by hitting me at E3 when you go.

411
00:41:43,852 --> 00:41:48,094
[SPEAKER_07]: I will.

412
00:41:48,234 --> 00:41:52,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, are we going to expect to see crappy songs that you picked in the next song pack?

413
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:53,396
[SPEAKER_07]: Heck yeah.

414
00:41:53,476 --> 00:42:01,620
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you remember way back when Ultramix 2 was done and they started announcing stuff about song packs, one of the other Vivid members

415
00:42:02,031 --> 00:42:03,232
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, any choice words for Sigurd?

416
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:32,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Dot, dot, dot.

417
00:42:35,744 --> 00:42:39,325
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, any choice words for Sigurd on his selection of Forever Sunshine?

418
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't care.

419
00:42:43,067 --> 00:42:45,368
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I already have that stupid song.

420
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:47,149
[SPEAKER_02]: Inceptmania.

421
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:48,649
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh-huh.

422
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:53,311
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying no fucking song pack, nor am I getting Ultramix 2.

423
00:42:53,391 --> 00:42:55,352
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't even have an Xbox, so you don't count.

424
00:42:56,292 --> 00:42:57,753
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have an Xbox shell.

425
00:43:00,134 --> 00:43:00,574
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um,

426
00:43:01,297 --> 00:43:02,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, hello?

427
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:05,841
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

428
00:43:05,861 --> 00:43:10,004
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's pick Forever Sunshine, because that's so much better than... I can't hear Sigurd.

429
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:10,705
[SPEAKER_03]: What, Sigurd?

430
00:43:10,745 --> 00:43:13,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I was saying, what's cooler than Forever Sunshine?

431
00:43:13,247 --> 00:43:13,908
[SPEAKER_03]: You can stay $5 for that.

432
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:14,768
[SPEAKER_03]: You should still privilege.

433
00:43:28,453 --> 00:43:33,361
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, how about every other Bomani song in existence is cooler than Forever Sunshine?

434
00:43:33,381 --> 00:43:37,047
[SPEAKER_07]: I have an idea!

435
00:43:37,628 --> 00:43:39,211
[SPEAKER_02]: Forever Sunshine rocks!

436
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:46,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's just get that, because, you know, songs like The Fall, or Hellscraper, or, I don't know, whatever else we can put out there.

437
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:56,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe anything that's in 2DX, you know, Ted Style, or anything below that, or, I don't know, Beat Manium, you know, all those songs suck.

438
00:43:56,470 --> 00:43:59,112
[SPEAKER_07]: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

439
00:44:01,477 --> 00:44:04,979
[SPEAKER_07]: One song that's appeared in only one mix, you know, just appear out of nowhere.

440
00:44:04,999 --> 00:44:06,259
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got 2DX songs.

441
00:44:06,299 --> 00:44:07,820
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't need more 2DX songs.

442
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:08,801
[SPEAKER_07]: We're done with 2DX.

443
00:44:09,201 --> 00:44:14,743
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I take songs from Keyboard Mania and Drum Mania and one-time uses in DDR.

444
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,224
[SPEAKER_03]: Sigurd, I have a question for you.

445
00:44:16,264 --> 00:44:17,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the Muppets?

446
00:44:18,625 --> 00:44:19,006
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

447
00:44:19,506 --> 00:44:22,207
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because Forever Sunshine sounds like Miss Piggy singing it.

448
00:44:23,268 --> 00:44:25,869
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you know that Malcolm in the Middle guy sounds like Kermit now?

449
00:44:29,139 --> 00:44:31,420
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the Rainbow Connection going to be in the next song pack?

450
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:32,980
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm curious about.

451
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,461
[SPEAKER_07]: The what?

452
00:44:34,981 --> 00:44:36,121
[SPEAKER_03]: The Rainbow Connection.

453
00:44:36,181 --> 00:44:36,742
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, forget it.

454
00:44:38,702 --> 00:44:39,302
[SPEAKER_03]: Forget it.

455
00:44:40,483 --> 00:44:42,063
[SPEAKER_03]: My insults are lost on you.

456
00:44:42,964 --> 00:44:44,164
[SPEAKER_07]: They really are.

457
00:44:45,204 --> 00:44:45,885
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, well thanks.

458
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:50,526
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share with our listeners, Seeger, before I hang up on you out of pure anger?

459
00:44:51,827 --> 00:44:54,328
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess they should just learn to deal with what they're given.

460
00:44:55,548 --> 00:44:56,048
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

461
00:44:56,368 --> 00:44:58,429
[SPEAKER_07]: They should shut up and quit being like DDR freaks.

462
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:02,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm gonna let you go.

463
00:45:03,284 --> 00:45:03,605
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

464
00:45:03,625 --> 00:45:03,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

465
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:04,606
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye.

466
00:45:05,527 --> 00:45:06,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm still mad at him.

467
00:45:08,069 --> 00:45:09,971
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever Sunshine and DDR, what the hell is that?

468
00:45:10,471 --> 00:45:17,118
[SPEAKER_02]: It's people like him that come up with wonderful ideas like stealing the karaoke revolution songs and put them in DDR extreme.

469
00:45:18,066 --> 00:45:27,190
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I, speaking of Karaoke Revolution and Bomani, you know what I, like, was announced like a month ago and I completely forgot to mention on this program until just right now?

470
00:45:28,070 --> 00:45:30,491
[SPEAKER_03]: That Bomani Karaoke Revolution game got cancelled.

471
00:45:30,952 --> 00:45:37,054
[SPEAKER_03]: So those of you guys that wanted to sing at Love Shine, sing Love Shine at home and stuff, sorry.

472
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:39,816
[SPEAKER_03]: No karaoke for you.

473
00:45:42,237 --> 00:45:42,457
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny.

474
00:45:45,558 --> 00:45:47,499
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I saw, um,

475
00:45:48,663 --> 00:45:49,963
[SPEAKER_02]: The Forever Sunshine was in it.

476
00:45:52,564 --> 00:46:00,507
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I guess Forever Sunshine was in the next Karaoke Revolution game, the Mamani one, and so they had to cancel it because they realized that that sucks.

477
00:46:03,108 --> 00:46:09,490
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't put Forever Sunshine in there because, I don't know, it just sucks.

478
00:46:11,618 --> 00:46:13,379
[SPEAKER_02]: I had something there, but it just went away.

479
00:46:13,399 --> 00:46:15,600
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to eat more gummy bears.

480
00:46:16,200 --> 00:46:19,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of curiosity, you started off last week with a five pound bag of gummy bears.

481
00:46:19,962 --> 00:46:20,903
[SPEAKER_03]: How many pounds are left?

482
00:46:22,383 --> 00:46:23,524
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably like a pound and a half.

483
00:46:24,284 --> 00:46:25,105
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a lot of gummy.

484
00:46:26,766 --> 00:46:27,506
[SPEAKER_03]: I helped, though.

485
00:46:27,566 --> 00:46:28,066
[SPEAKER_03]: I did help.

486
00:46:28,727 --> 00:46:30,207
[SPEAKER_03]: I have about a pound left.

487
00:46:30,627 --> 00:46:32,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I was offering gummy bears to people.

488
00:46:32,288 --> 00:46:35,290
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, hi, I know these are my roommates, but you want some gummy bears?

489
00:46:37,171 --> 00:46:37,591
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get more.

490
00:46:38,137 --> 00:46:39,618
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

491
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:05,874
[SPEAKER_03]: Dance Mania Speed G4 has been announced.

492
00:47:06,454 --> 00:47:09,837
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I have issues with this already.

493
00:47:09,857 --> 00:47:10,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

494
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:10,577
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

495
00:47:10,937 --> 00:47:13,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's G4 in it.

496
00:47:13,659 --> 00:47:16,461
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the name of the album is Dance Mania Speed G4.

497
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:18,982
[SPEAKER_03]: And how appropriate that it should be named that.

498
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:24,345
[SPEAKER_03]: You get songs like Toxic, the Trance Speedo mix by Helen.

499
00:47:25,746 --> 00:47:30,309
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get other songs like Let's Groove by Beatbox featuring DJ Speedo.

500
00:47:31,346 --> 00:47:33,888
[SPEAKER_03]: and a song called Wookiee Wookiee by Jenny Rom.

501
00:47:35,448 --> 00:47:37,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Piano Concerto No.

502
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:41,412
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 in B-flat minor by Speedmaster.

503
00:47:41,832 --> 00:47:44,073
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like they're mixing that classical speed thing.

504
00:47:44,113 --> 00:47:44,514
[SPEAKER_11]: Speedmaster!

505
00:47:44,534 --> 00:47:44,934
[SPEAKER_11]: Speedmaster!

506
00:47:45,054 --> 00:47:48,876
[SPEAKER_03]: And how can we forget Hostile Takeover, the B4 is a beat mix?

507
00:47:49,557 --> 00:47:50,357
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta love that one.

508
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:58,101
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, of course, this has got to be the coolest thing that's on there, Theme from Miami Vice by The Extra Terror Sound.

509
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:58,582
[SPEAKER_19]: That's cool.

510
00:47:59,406 --> 00:48:01,947
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a speed version, so I don't know what to expect from that.

511
00:48:04,588 --> 00:48:06,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, Smoke on the Water, that's worth mentioning.

512
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,231
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys will want to check out the full song list.

513
00:48:09,271 --> 00:48:14,933
[SPEAKER_03]: It is posted to our website, www.orangelongeradio.com But you know what's even cooler?

514
00:48:15,554 --> 00:48:15,734
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

515
00:48:15,754 --> 00:48:16,854
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else is coming out soon?

516
00:48:16,934 --> 00:48:17,134
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

517
00:48:17,414 --> 00:48:19,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Airwolf Season 1 on DVD.

518
00:48:20,736 --> 00:48:21,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

519
00:48:21,636 --> 00:48:21,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Really.

520
00:48:22,657 --> 00:48:23,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

521
00:48:23,657 --> 00:48:27,019
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what Dance Mania Speed G4 doesn't have that Airwolf has?

522
00:48:27,039 --> 00:48:27,119
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

523
00:48:28,092 --> 00:48:31,154
[SPEAKER_02]: A fucking kick-ass helicopter, that's for sure.

524
00:48:34,237 --> 00:48:35,898
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I've successfully... I have one helicopter.

525
00:48:36,979 --> 00:48:38,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but you don't have a cool helicopter like... I do.

526
00:48:39,121 --> 00:48:41,202
[SPEAKER_02]: This was like Thunder in Paradise, but in the air.

527
00:48:42,103 --> 00:48:42,783
[SPEAKER_19]: But I have a Humvee.

528
00:48:42,803 --> 00:48:45,606
[SPEAKER_02]: And without, you know... Hulk Hogan.

529
00:48:45,646 --> 00:48:46,887
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh my god, I had the coolest dream.

530
00:48:48,848 --> 00:48:51,710
[SPEAKER_19]: I dreamt I really had a Humvee with a missile turret on it.

531
00:48:52,311 --> 00:48:53,251
[SPEAKER_03]: And what were you doing with it?

532
00:48:53,432 --> 00:48:54,352
[SPEAKER_19]: It was just my normal car.

533
00:48:54,893 --> 00:48:55,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

534
00:48:58,546 --> 00:49:01,847
[SPEAKER_02]: So you were in, I don't know, Cruisin' World?

535
00:49:04,409 --> 00:49:05,549
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it was Cruisin' World.

536
00:49:05,569 --> 00:49:06,510
[SPEAKER_19]: Wasn't it that had the Humvee?

537
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:08,130
[SPEAKER_19]: That was cool.

538
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:13,613
[SPEAKER_19]: I used to always use the three-wheeled truck.

539
00:49:18,395 --> 00:49:19,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, other Bomani news.

540
00:49:19,456 --> 00:49:19,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's move on.

541
00:49:20,216 --> 00:49:20,936
[SPEAKER_19]: School Bus!

542
00:49:23,789 --> 00:49:24,910
[SPEAKER_03]: You know DDR Freak?

543
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:26,192
[SPEAKER_03]: You've ever heard of that website?

544
00:49:26,272 --> 00:49:27,213
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

545
00:49:28,695 --> 00:49:29,596
[SPEAKER_03]: You know it's a site.

546
00:49:30,116 --> 00:49:34,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know they actually syndicate our program on Friday nights over on DDR Freak Radio.

547
00:49:34,361 --> 00:49:34,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

548
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:35,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it.

549
00:49:35,963 --> 00:49:36,643
[SPEAKER_03]: Check them out someday.

550
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:37,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we should.

551
00:49:38,185 --> 00:49:42,310
[SPEAKER_03]: DDRFreak.com turned five years old this week.

552
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:45,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Five years old.

553
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,451
[SPEAKER_03]: How old does that make you feel?

554
00:49:47,511 --> 00:49:50,954
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember when DDR Freak did not look like it did today.

555
00:49:50,994 --> 00:49:53,716
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't even have the same address and everything.

556
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:55,677
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember it being green.

557
00:49:57,038 --> 00:50:01,761
[SPEAKER_02]: And did it have the same bad grammar that we've learned to come in love?

558
00:50:02,022 --> 00:50:02,602
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, indeed.

559
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:09,547
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember having the biggest post count back in the day.

560
00:50:10,327 --> 00:50:10,987
[SPEAKER_03]: What happened with that?

561
00:50:11,027 --> 00:50:12,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it that you had the biggest post count?

562
00:50:12,148 --> 00:50:13,728
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I don't really post that much.

563
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:17,750
[SPEAKER_19]: I just watch threads now, that's all I do.

564
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:19,651
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay, this is stupid.

565
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:21,451
[SPEAKER_19]: No flames here, moving on.

566
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,253
[SPEAKER_19]: Nothing to see here.

567
00:50:24,273 --> 00:50:28,974
[SPEAKER_19]: You can't lock a thread for being too stupid, but it has to be pointlessly stupid.

568
00:50:30,255 --> 00:50:36,477
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought maybe we could go around and kind of talk about the first time we visited DDR Freak and what we thought of it.

569
00:50:37,298 --> 00:50:37,458
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

570
00:50:37,498 --> 00:50:37,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

571
00:50:39,088 --> 00:50:42,611
[SPEAKER_03]: I read, this is a tribute, by the way, to DDR Freak Turning 5.

572
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:52,780
[SPEAKER_02]: I read the, what was it, DDR USA, the manual, and in the back there was a special thanks to DDRFreak.com.

573
00:50:52,840 --> 00:50:54,342
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I first found the website.

574
00:50:55,803 --> 00:51:01,208
[SPEAKER_02]: To which then I first found the regional forums, to which I found the link to Sakpamani.

575
00:51:02,987 --> 00:51:04,608
[SPEAKER_02]: All links to the DDR USA manual.

576
00:51:04,669 --> 00:51:06,070
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, there are people that actually read that.

577
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I was that bored.

578
00:51:07,251 --> 00:51:11,094
[SPEAKER_03]: I was gonna say, that's like tiny-ass print in the back of the manual there.

579
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:13,116
[SPEAKER_02]: I was that bored.

580
00:51:14,117 --> 00:51:17,860
[SPEAKER_03]: So on your first visit to DDR Freak, you learned about the locals here, so that's cool.

581
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:18,080
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

582
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:18,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

583
00:51:19,461 --> 00:51:21,924
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your first visit to DDR Freak.

584
00:51:22,644 --> 00:51:26,067
[SPEAKER_19]: This had to have been... It was right before AX2000.

585
00:51:28,653 --> 00:51:46,967
[SPEAKER_19]: So, actually right around the time of AX2000, because I was just getting into a lot of it, I was looking for more people who play, and I just started posting there, found people who had other interests, and then I randomly made the Sacramentals thread on DDR Freak and...

586
00:51:48,507 --> 00:51:51,009
[SPEAKER_03]: And oh my god, did we get yelled at in that thread?

587
00:51:51,029 --> 00:51:52,250
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were random.

588
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:58,254
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll tell you what, it was nothing compared to the random chat you see today on DDR Free.

589
00:51:58,314 --> 00:52:00,996
[SPEAKER_19]: But man, people were like, you guys are losers, right?

590
00:52:02,497 --> 00:52:02,957
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what?

591
00:52:03,117 --> 00:52:04,298
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't want to see it.

592
00:52:04,358 --> 00:52:05,358
[SPEAKER_19]: They didn't have to click that thread.

593
00:52:08,381 --> 00:52:08,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Amen.

594
00:52:09,361 --> 00:52:10,922
[SPEAKER_03]: How'd you end up becoming a moderator over there?

595
00:52:11,683 --> 00:52:13,424
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I was a good babysitter.

596
00:52:14,426 --> 00:52:18,787
[SPEAKER_19]: I had this habit of insinuating myself between people's arguments just because I didn't want to see all the crap.

597
00:52:19,567 --> 00:52:21,247
[SPEAKER_19]: And I posted so much I was available.

598
00:52:21,267 --> 00:52:23,528
[SPEAKER_19]: This was when I was working at GNC.

599
00:52:24,368 --> 00:52:27,069
[SPEAKER_19]: I was available all the time and posted all the time.

600
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:30,249
[SPEAKER_19]: And I had pretty good people skills, so I got offered the position.

601
00:52:31,990 --> 00:52:33,310
[SPEAKER_19]: Right as my cable went down.

602
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:37,491
[SPEAKER_19]: So, but it was pretty cool.

603
00:52:37,971 --> 00:52:38,811
[SPEAKER_19]: I still like doing it.

604
00:52:38,851 --> 00:52:39,271
[SPEAKER_19]: I kind of...

605
00:52:39,870 --> 00:52:40,571
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

606
00:52:57,768 --> 00:53:13,761
[SPEAKER_03]: and I do remember the boards were green and I remember a lot of people that were posting were all in the Bay Area and they were talking about the songs they were playing and passing and the freestyle stuff and I was just kind of like these guys are sick, obsessive little freaks which is really funny in retrospect that I thought that

607
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:18,246
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I lurked for a long time.

608
00:53:18,426 --> 00:53:21,569
[SPEAKER_03]: I lurked for probably a good two months.

609
00:53:21,729 --> 00:53:26,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I was lurking, they were not using a PHP board.

610
00:53:26,353 --> 00:53:30,196
[SPEAKER_03]: They were using some other type of web board when I first was looking at it.

611
00:53:30,236 --> 00:53:30,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lurking at it.

612
00:53:31,197 --> 00:53:33,619
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they did the PHP board, I think that's when I finally signed up.

613
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,041
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not the same one that we know now.

614
00:53:36,101 --> 00:53:38,503
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, there was another board in between.

615
00:53:38,523 --> 00:53:39,584
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even remember.

616
00:53:39,644 --> 00:53:41,425
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's when I signed up and stopped lurking.

617
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:44,107
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was probably about the same time as that Sacramentals thread.

618
00:53:44,407 --> 00:53:49,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I remember us all taking that trip to the Bay Area to play Parapara for the first time.

619
00:53:50,072 --> 00:53:50,793
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty awesome.

620
00:53:52,134 --> 00:53:53,135
[SPEAKER_18]: That was really fun.

621
00:53:53,375 --> 00:53:55,076
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was my first DDR Freak experience.

622
00:53:56,057 --> 00:53:57,158
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, do you remember?

623
00:53:58,979 --> 00:53:59,279
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

624
00:53:59,860 --> 00:54:02,182
[SPEAKER_17]: Unfortunately, I was the late bloomer out of all of you guys.

625
00:54:02,222 --> 00:54:02,822
[SPEAKER_17]: But that's okay.

626
00:54:04,224 --> 00:54:05,549
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually I'll blame it on Orange Lounge.

627
00:54:07,533 --> 00:54:27,430
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, probably around 2002 or so, so, you know, like I said, I was a late bloomer out of all of you guys, but, uh, it's pretty cool, I still pretty, I don't do the forums, you know, as far as posting is concerned, because someone took my name, so, you know, and I can't think of anything else that's cool, so, um, you know, because my handle's my handle.

628
00:54:28,771 --> 00:54:35,056
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I just, you know, look and, uh, read stuff, but other than that, no.

629
00:54:38,692 --> 00:54:41,853
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy birthday to you folks there at DDR Freak.

630
00:54:41,893 --> 00:54:43,474
[SPEAKER_03]: You're turning five years old.

631
00:54:44,354 --> 00:54:46,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you all can be placed in kindergarten.

632
00:54:47,315 --> 00:54:50,636
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe you'll learn something.

633
00:54:51,857 --> 00:54:54,978
[SPEAKER_03]: But man, that just kind of shows how long DDR itself has been around.

634
00:54:55,038 --> 00:54:55,778
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of interesting.

635
00:54:57,479 --> 00:55:01,760
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting too to go to DDR Freak and look at the headlines and they're all about in the groove.

636
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,541
[SPEAKER_03]: It kind of shows you where this thing's going.

637
00:55:06,222 --> 00:55:06,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting.

638
00:55:08,618 --> 00:55:14,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's take another quick break, and when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match.

639
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we'll do ourselves a list list tonight.

640
00:55:16,121 --> 00:55:18,321
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't done one of those in a while, and I have a good idea for a topic.

641
00:55:18,401 --> 00:55:19,142
[SPEAKER_19]: That sounds like fun.

642
00:55:19,342 --> 00:55:23,643
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll do that, and we'll also open up the Skype line for those of you guys that want to call in.

643
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:26,664
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this break, you get some Bomani Potpourri.

644
00:55:26,704 --> 00:55:29,885
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no rhyme or reason why we're playing these songs, we just want to hear them.

645
00:55:29,965 --> 00:55:31,206
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll be back after this.

646
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:43,368
[SPEAKER_00]: Dream a dream together, a dream that is real

647
00:57:00,673 --> 00:57:02,574
One, two, three, four!

648
00:57:02,714 --> 00:57:03,434
I love you

649
00:57:48,958 --> 00:57:49,819
Come on, come on!

650
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:13,645
[SPEAKER_24]: Easier to Dance To Than That Freaking Catch-Up Song Orange Lounge Radio

651
01:01:25,498 --> 01:01:25,939
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeofficer.com

652
01:01:45,098 --> 01:01:46,279
[SPEAKER_03]: House of Wax

653
01:02:10,854 --> 01:02:11,074
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

654
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:11,714
[SPEAKER_19]: Which I will not see.

655
01:02:11,854 --> 01:02:14,715
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a call already, so we don't have to worry about Paris Hilton chat.

656
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:16,035
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

657
01:02:16,816 --> 01:02:17,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, Sky.

658
01:02:17,336 --> 01:02:17,776
[SPEAKER_03]: Siggy here.

659
01:02:17,936 --> 01:02:18,676
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello, Siggy.

660
01:02:18,716 --> 01:02:19,216
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you?

661
01:02:20,076 --> 01:02:21,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing... I fell asleep.

662
01:02:21,477 --> 01:02:22,237
[SPEAKER_03]: I just woke up.

663
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:25,878
[SPEAKER_03]: So you fell asleep and you missed the first part of Orange Lawns Radio?

664
01:02:26,298 --> 01:02:29,959
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, just only, you know, just the first 30 minutes.

665
01:02:30,039 --> 01:02:30,419
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

666
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:32,600
[SPEAKER_03]: You know about the best thing that you missed so far?

667
01:02:33,340 --> 01:02:33,600
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

668
01:02:35,581 --> 01:02:39,362
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, I didn't miss that, really.

669
01:02:39,762 --> 01:02:40,522
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't miss that.

670
01:02:41,139 --> 01:02:41,639
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry.

671
01:02:43,300 --> 01:02:43,960
[SPEAKER_20]: I didn't miss that.

672
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:47,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well then, I guess you really didn't miss anything that good then.

673
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:50,163
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'm actually kind of glad you called in.

674
01:02:50,423 --> 01:02:53,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what you called in to talk about, but I got a question for you.

675
01:02:53,424 --> 01:02:54,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything new on Night Style?

676
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:55,945
[SPEAKER_03]: Any new news going on there?

677
01:02:56,325 --> 01:02:58,566
[SPEAKER_20]: I was about to say that, actually.

678
01:02:58,606 --> 01:02:59,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Hooray!

679
01:02:59,686 --> 01:03:00,187
[SPEAKER_20]: We're like-minded.

680
01:03:00,207 --> 01:03:01,347
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, we got the latest as of today.

681
01:03:01,927 --> 01:03:02,147
[SPEAKER_27]: Ooh.

682
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:03,988
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

683
01:03:04,908 --> 01:03:08,790
[SPEAKER_20]: There was a Tokyo demo held yesterday in Japan.

684
01:03:10,191 --> 01:03:13,854
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what they've said so far about a demo of the Night Style.

685
01:03:15,755 --> 01:03:23,779
[SPEAKER_20]: There was no revival song information was revealed because the demo only had 32 songs and no old songs were revealed.

686
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,401
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, so they're trying to keep things secret then.

687
01:03:28,412 --> 01:03:30,153
[SPEAKER_03]: Did any word get out about the timing?

688
01:03:30,173 --> 01:03:37,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you remember when Night Stalk came out in the arcades, people bitched about the timing issues in it, so I'm wondering how that's going to affect the home version.

689
01:03:37,896 --> 01:03:45,259
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, according to people who went there, the timing seems to be fine, though a few people have mentioned that it seems tighter than previous versions.

690
01:03:45,659 --> 01:03:53,122
[SPEAKER_20]: Whether it was just due to the environment, like the controller, TV positioning, etc., or was an actual timing difference is unknown.

691
01:03:53,769 --> 01:03:54,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

692
01:03:54,249 --> 01:03:58,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's true, because if you're playing it at a loud expo, it's probably going to be hard to nail the timing like you usually do.

693
01:04:00,171 --> 01:04:00,951
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting, though.

694
01:04:01,051 --> 01:04:12,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I'd be okay with that if they were tightening up the timing windows a little bit, but just... You know how Night Style in the arcade had this whole different feel to it, probably because of rumors that they had changed some hardware and things like that.

695
01:04:12,675 --> 01:04:12,935
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.

696
01:04:14,075 --> 01:04:14,615
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

697
01:04:14,775 --> 01:04:16,556
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else going on with Night Style that you know of?

698
01:04:17,116 --> 01:04:17,196
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

699
01:04:18,036 --> 01:04:19,817
[SPEAKER_20]: Random Plus is said to be there.

700
01:04:20,898 --> 01:04:23,839
[SPEAKER_20]: High Speed 4 is there, so if anybody's worried.

701
01:04:26,100 --> 01:04:31,684
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting that we don't know any of the consumer songs yet, considering we're only about, what, two weeks away from release?

702
01:04:32,704 --> 01:04:35,706
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't really know a whole lot about those consumer tracks, hopefully.

703
01:04:36,306 --> 01:04:41,749
[SPEAKER_20]: Speaking of consumer tracks, there are five CS-exclusive songs that have been released recently.

704
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:49,112
[SPEAKER_20]: Here they are, the genre, and I'll mention the genre, the song, and the artist.

705
01:04:49,172 --> 01:04:50,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, so these are for Night Style?

706
01:04:50,932 --> 01:04:51,152
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

707
01:04:51,313 --> 01:04:52,013
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool, okay.

708
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:56,875
[SPEAKER_20]: The genre here is Dance Pop, and it's Usual Days Remix by Otatu.

709
01:04:57,195 --> 01:04:57,475
[SPEAKER_27]: Okay.

710
01:04:58,035 --> 01:05:01,837
[SPEAKER_20]: It's 4-star on Light 7, 7-star on 7 Keys.

711
01:05:02,377 --> 01:05:02,757
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

712
01:05:03,537 --> 01:05:07,399
[SPEAKER_20]: And then Ragged Jungle, 5PM Eternal by Garoovee, featuring Nochiin.

713
01:05:08,566 --> 01:05:12,088
[SPEAKER_20]: 5 Star on Light 7, Flashing 7 on 7 Keys.

714
01:05:12,269 --> 01:05:14,390
[SPEAKER_20]: Is that LED and Groovy or just Groovy?

715
01:05:14,850 --> 01:05:15,531
[SPEAKER_20]: Just Groovy.

716
01:05:15,571 --> 01:05:16,291
[SPEAKER_20]: Interesting, okay.

717
01:05:17,212 --> 01:05:23,756
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the genre is Discotheque, 80s Capsule by Megumi Upper Slope, 3 Star on Light 7, 4 Star on 7 Keys.

718
01:05:24,356 --> 01:05:25,077
[SPEAKER_20]: Hmm, okay.

719
01:05:26,117 --> 01:05:32,722
[SPEAKER_20]: Club Jazz, Paramnesia by Ushiroda Shinji, 4 Star on Light 7, 6 Star on 7 Keys.

720
01:05:33,002 --> 01:05:33,342
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

721
01:05:33,802 --> 01:05:34,743
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the fifth song...

722
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:42,975
[SPEAKER_20]: Which, you know, genre is drum and bass Photogenic by LED featuring Horisawa Maiko

723
01:05:44,542 --> 01:05:46,943
[SPEAKER_20]: Six Star and Light Seven, Seven Star and Seven Keys.

724
01:05:46,963 --> 01:05:50,124
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are the only five songs that have been announced so far.

725
01:05:50,164 --> 01:05:51,244
[SPEAKER_20]: So there are two more.

726
01:05:52,465 --> 01:05:54,665
[SPEAKER_03]: That's more than I knew about already, so that's cool.

727
01:05:54,766 --> 01:05:58,527
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good that LED's going to have one in there, because I always like his stuff.

728
01:05:58,567 --> 01:06:02,328
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though it all kind of sounds similar, I'm excited to see that's going to be there.

729
01:06:02,368 --> 01:06:10,771
[SPEAKER_20]: Let me send you this link on the website, which is actually a screenshot of the menu select interface of 2DX Nightstyle.

730
01:06:10,871 --> 01:06:11,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, very cool.

731
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:16,834
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's you posting in the chatroom there as DarkLionXVI for those that want to click on that link.

732
01:06:17,415 --> 01:06:18,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, very cool.

733
01:06:19,856 --> 01:06:21,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pulling it up here on my end here on the computer.

734
01:06:21,997 --> 01:06:24,559
[SPEAKER_03]: Ah, okay.

735
01:06:25,379 --> 01:06:29,601
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it pretty much looks like the arcade did a little bit, a little bit condensed down, but I like that.

736
01:06:30,162 --> 01:06:30,622
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good look.

737
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:33,451
[SPEAKER_03]: I just like Night Style a whole bunch.

738
01:06:33,971 --> 01:06:36,914
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's going to be the one that gets me back into 2DX.

739
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:40,477
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know I said that about 7th and 8th and it didn't work, but Night Style will be the one.

740
01:06:40,817 --> 01:06:41,058
[SPEAKER_03]: It will.

741
01:06:42,819 --> 01:06:46,222
[SPEAKER_20]: In case you notice on the picture that there are clear lamps are in there.

742
01:06:47,924 --> 01:06:49,805
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, like the colored markers.

743
01:06:50,326 --> 01:06:52,488
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you got this song finished.

744
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:52,688
[SPEAKER_20]: Good.

745
01:06:52,808 --> 01:06:53,048
[SPEAKER_20]: Right on.

746
01:06:57,509 --> 01:06:58,349
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, anything else?

747
01:06:59,230 --> 01:06:59,710
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah?

748
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:06,733
[SPEAKER_20]: On 9thStyleCS, for those who have played it, Quasar was supposed to have the 10thStyle video in it.

749
01:07:07,293 --> 01:07:07,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

750
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:10,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, right on.

751
01:07:10,455 --> 01:07:13,316
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you know how Quasar didn't really have, like, it had a generic video on 9thStyle.

752
01:07:13,336 --> 01:07:15,057
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, it's a generic video from the background.

753
01:07:15,417 --> 01:07:15,777
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, good.

754
01:07:16,057 --> 01:07:17,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope they do give a 10thStyle video.

755
01:07:17,678 --> 01:07:22,140
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that we get a 10thStyle or a Red song in there that crosses over as well.

756
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:25,301
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be kind of nice, but I guess we don't know anything yet, huh?

757
01:07:26,445 --> 01:07:34,654
[SPEAKER_20]: No, so... Yeah, they still have the folder sorting, you know, like by folders, like by letter, by the level of the difficulty of the song.

758
01:07:34,714 --> 01:07:34,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

759
01:07:35,395 --> 01:07:38,918
[SPEAKER_20]: They have it, or supposedly have it in there.

760
01:07:39,078 --> 01:07:39,379
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

761
01:07:40,006 --> 01:07:46,368
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm sure the next two weeks will be busy two weeks for Night Style News, so hopefully we'll have more stuff next week and the week after, of course.

762
01:07:47,169 --> 01:07:48,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, as always, for the update, Siggy.

763
01:07:49,129 --> 01:07:49,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

764
01:07:49,349 --> 01:07:50,510
[SPEAKER_20]: Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

765
01:07:51,630 --> 01:07:52,811
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, nothing much to say.

766
01:07:53,651 --> 01:07:53,971
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

767
01:07:54,611 --> 01:07:54,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.

768
01:07:54,932 --> 01:07:56,892
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thanks for calling in and giving us this update.

769
01:07:57,472 --> 01:07:57,733
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

770
01:07:57,853 --> 01:07:58,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

771
01:07:58,873 --> 01:07:59,073
[SPEAKER_20]: Later.

772
01:07:59,353 --> 01:07:59,593
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

773
01:08:00,514 --> 01:08:01,154
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, let's go.

774
01:08:01,174 --> 01:08:06,176
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, a bunch of people hammering us trying to get in tonight, so we'll just kind of take the calls as we see them.

775
01:08:06,256 --> 01:08:07,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Sounds Radio.

776
01:08:08,035 --> 01:08:09,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Sky, it's El Mullet.

777
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:10,976
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello my friend, how are you?

778
01:08:11,636 --> 01:08:13,036
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing good, how about yourself?

779
01:08:13,157 --> 01:08:15,677
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty good, I'm actually kind of glad you called in.

780
01:08:16,618 --> 01:08:17,538
[SPEAKER_12]: Really, how so?

781
01:08:17,658 --> 01:08:19,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a bone to pick with Inside Pulse.

782
01:08:20,519 --> 01:08:21,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now what?

783
01:08:22,139 --> 01:08:24,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I was reading the review of Tekken 5 over there.

784
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, for crying out loud, not this.

785
01:08:27,981 --> 01:08:34,883
[SPEAKER_03]: And the guy was totally dogging on the music, and I'm like, oh my gosh, Tekken 5 has great music in it, I think.

786
01:08:36,133 --> 01:08:37,795
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be his opinion.

787
01:08:38,016 --> 01:08:38,496
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

788
01:08:38,636 --> 01:08:39,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it wasn't you.

789
01:08:39,978 --> 01:08:41,260
[SPEAKER_12]: It's all about the moonlight stage.

790
01:08:41,780 --> 01:08:46,446
[SPEAKER_03]: But since you're the closest thing I have to being able to yell at Inside Pulse, I'm yelling at you.

791
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:54,490
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, there always is the email link to the person who wrote the review.

792
01:08:54,610 --> 01:08:57,711
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure he would like another flame to add to his collection.

793
01:08:57,831 --> 01:09:00,471
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to flame this guy via email.

794
01:09:00,551 --> 01:09:02,632
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd rather he call in so I can yell at him in person.

795
01:09:03,532 --> 01:09:04,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right.

796
01:09:04,932 --> 01:09:07,973
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you supposed to say when you argue about somebody with music?

797
01:09:08,353 --> 01:09:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Arguing with people about music is something I never understood because it's like, this song sucks.

798
01:09:12,954 --> 01:09:13,515
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.

799
01:09:13,575 --> 01:09:14,055
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, it does.

800
01:09:14,135 --> 01:09:14,555
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it doesn't.

801
01:09:14,756 --> 01:09:23,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what can you, how can you say, you know, people's perception of music, it is totally and purely opinion, really.

802
01:09:23,302 --> 01:09:25,484
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, what sounds good to me may not sound good to you, you know.

803
01:09:25,684 --> 01:09:27,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I completely agree with you there, Sky.

804
01:09:27,425 --> 01:09:33,049
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, but if we don't have arguments about music, we wouldn't have any song pack discussion.

805
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:36,452
[SPEAKER_03]: But one thing we can all agree on is that Forever Sunshine sucks balls.

806
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,235
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I can't agree with you there.

807
01:09:39,435 --> 01:09:42,699
[SPEAKER_12]: I cannot agree with you that it sucks balls.

808
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:46,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I can tolerate it and enjoy it when I'm in the right mood.

809
01:09:47,404 --> 01:09:51,149
[SPEAKER_12]: I will take forever sunshine on this song pack.

810
01:09:51,729 --> 01:09:52,150
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't

811
01:09:52,850 --> 01:09:54,811
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft

812
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:24,752
[SPEAKER_12]: That needs to be played on every episode of Orange Lounge from here to eternity.

813
01:10:24,832 --> 01:10:26,493
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the new inside joke.

814
01:10:26,533 --> 01:10:26,833
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

815
01:10:26,853 --> 01:10:28,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be the new cake pie.

816
01:10:29,795 --> 01:10:30,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

817
01:10:30,396 --> 01:10:32,537
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, so to what do we owe the call?

818
01:10:32,617 --> 01:10:36,700
[SPEAKER_03]: I got you sidetracked there because I wanted to yell at you, but to what do we owe this call tonight, El Mullet?

819
01:10:37,441 --> 01:10:41,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, we owe this call to, well, song pack discussion.

820
01:10:41,204 --> 01:10:47,729
[SPEAKER_12]: I find it just very interesting to see everybody's dog in Forever Sunshine, whether you like it or not.

821
01:10:48,350 --> 01:10:53,294
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's dog in it, and it's like, oh, now this song pack's going to suck because Forever Sunshine's in it.

822
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:59,939
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, well, a song pack doesn't suck if one bad song is in it, because one good song can make a song pack very good, too.

823
01:11:00,559 --> 01:11:01,660
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, exactly.

824
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:03,461
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's what I'm trying to get across.

825
01:11:03,822 --> 01:11:08,545
[SPEAKER_12]: There are people out there who have labeled the song pack as bad thanks to one song.

826
01:11:08,605 --> 01:11:10,307
[SPEAKER_01]: Worst song pack ever!

827
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:19,393
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, people labeled song pack 3 bad because as soon as they heard Dynamite Rave was going to be on it before it was even released, Oh no, it's Dynamite Rave!

828
01:11:19,473 --> 01:11:20,794
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone's played it already!

829
01:11:20,874 --> 01:11:21,475
[SPEAKER_12]: Go away!

830
01:11:24,198 --> 01:11:26,262
[SPEAKER_03]: That's true, and I was one of those people.

831
01:11:26,362 --> 01:11:29,928
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, there were things on Sompac 3 that I was looking forward to.

832
01:11:30,249 --> 01:11:32,533
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be honest, it's not a big surprise either.

833
01:11:32,613 --> 01:11:36,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, way back in the day when USA Mix was all there was.

834
01:11:36,570 --> 01:11:37,631
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you remember this.

835
01:11:37,891 --> 01:11:40,813
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people would play Dynamite Rave at Golf Land?

836
01:11:41,173 --> 01:11:41,874
[SPEAKER_12]: Everyone.

837
01:11:42,454 --> 01:11:43,815
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, exactly.

838
01:11:45,216 --> 01:11:47,378
[SPEAKER_12]: But I'm personally looking forward to this song pack.

839
01:11:47,418 --> 01:11:49,940
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm definitely looking forward to the new songs.

840
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,181
[SPEAKER_12]: Jelly Kiss, most definitely.

841
01:11:52,281 --> 01:11:59,606
[SPEAKER_12]: I put together a list a long, long, long time ago that I never released to anybody of what songs I'd like to see on song packs.

842
01:12:00,527 --> 01:12:06,294
[SPEAKER_12]: I put down 19 November, that ended up being on the mix, and Jelly Kiss was the only one so far that actually made it.

843
01:12:06,394 --> 01:12:07,896
[SPEAKER_03]: You got a Santa thing going on there?

844
01:12:08,216 --> 01:12:08,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Sana?

845
01:12:08,717 --> 01:12:08,977
[SPEAKER_03]: Sana?

846
01:12:09,478 --> 01:12:10,159
[SPEAKER_12]: I like Sana.

847
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:12,221
[SPEAKER_12]: Sana's a good group.

848
01:12:12,482 --> 01:12:14,144
[SPEAKER_03]: I totally just did the white boy pronunciation.

849
01:12:14,184 --> 01:12:14,504
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa?

850
01:12:15,145 --> 01:12:16,606
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anyway.

851
01:12:17,307 --> 01:12:17,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa.

852
01:12:18,048 --> 01:12:18,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa.

853
01:12:20,057 --> 01:12:22,618
[SPEAKER_03]: That Santa Moleste song, what is that about?

854
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:24,998
[SPEAKER_19]: That's pervy.

855
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:32,140
[SPEAKER_12]: That's pervy, just wait until Jelly Kiss comes out.

856
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:38,281
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just glad that Ultramix 2 kind of lives on this way through these songpacks still coming out.

857
01:12:38,521 --> 01:12:44,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I am a little upset that it took so darn long to start getting these songpacks to roll out regularly because there was that hold up with the whole Canadian thing.

858
01:12:45,582 --> 01:12:49,203
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm glad to see the songpacks coming and keeping Ultramix 2 going.

859
01:12:49,847 --> 01:12:50,587
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, that's fine.

860
01:12:50,627 --> 01:12:56,431
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it was all Microsoft's fault here, and as soon as SP8 came out, I'm sure people were dancing in the streets.

861
01:12:56,731 --> 01:12:59,973
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if they were fanboys enough to do so.

862
01:13:01,254 --> 01:13:03,515
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was actually playing Ultramix 2 online today.

863
01:13:03,535 --> 01:13:04,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of interesting.

864
01:13:04,295 --> 01:13:10,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually playing another Xbox game, and I got an invite over to Ultramix 2 from somebody who is...

865
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:16,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I think she's the number one Ultramix player and she's like in the top five of Ultramix 2.

866
01:13:17,241 --> 01:13:18,382
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's really, really good.

867
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:22,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So she sent me a challenge thing because, you know, we have fun when we play on there.

868
01:13:23,263 --> 01:13:25,344
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually played against her and it was cool.

869
01:13:25,384 --> 01:13:27,585
[SPEAKER_03]: We were just going down the list alphabetically.

870
01:13:27,965 --> 01:13:32,187
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just, you know, we were just going down the list alphabetically and there's so many good songs in Ultramix 2.

871
01:13:32,247 --> 01:13:34,708
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, I do love that mix.

872
01:13:34,748 --> 01:13:35,588
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish I'd played it more.

873
01:13:36,323 --> 01:13:37,684
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me excited for Ultramix 3.

874
01:13:38,344 --> 01:13:41,846
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know nothing official has been announced with Ultramix 3, but come on.

875
01:13:42,286 --> 01:13:43,467
[SPEAKER_03]: There's got to be an Ultramix 3.

876
01:13:44,188 --> 01:13:53,693
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else, speaking of Ultramix, I was actually at Best Buy yesterday, and I was looking for a new game to pick up, and I noticed that DDR Ultramix was in Xbox Platinum Hits now.

877
01:13:54,475 --> 01:13:54,955
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, really?

878
01:13:54,975 --> 01:13:56,136
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I saw that the other day.

879
01:13:56,216 --> 01:13:57,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize that.

880
01:13:57,596 --> 01:13:58,897
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, that totally came out of nowhere.

881
01:13:59,297 --> 01:14:02,078
[SPEAKER_03]: So, has that been that way for a long time?

882
01:14:02,418 --> 01:14:03,339
[SPEAKER_19]: I think it's more recent.

883
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:04,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it more recent?

884
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just so you guys know, Ultramix is only $20 now because it's a Platinum hit.

885
01:14:08,020 --> 01:14:13,482
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can get the Platinum hits cover, too, because the cover looks a little different when you're Platinum hits games.

886
01:14:13,502 --> 01:14:14,283
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of neat to see.

887
01:14:15,017 --> 01:14:18,799
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so we can now say, no matter what you think of the first Ultramix, guess what?

888
01:14:18,859 --> 01:14:19,999
[SPEAKER_12]: It was successful enough.

889
01:14:20,199 --> 01:14:20,699
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

890
01:14:20,759 --> 01:14:24,521
[SPEAKER_03]: And Ultramix 2 is probably destined for the Platinum hits soon enough as well.

891
01:14:24,601 --> 01:14:25,381
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's pretty exciting.

892
01:14:25,401 --> 01:14:28,703
[SPEAKER_12]: If Ultramix 1 can make it, then Ultramix 2 should be Platinum by the end of the year.

893
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:29,383
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.

894
01:14:29,683 --> 01:14:30,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, you know, it was interesting.

895
01:14:30,804 --> 01:14:34,965
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been really into this website lately for video games.

896
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1up.com.

897
01:14:36,326 --> 01:14:37,346
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys have heard of this.

898
01:14:37,546 --> 01:14:38,007
[SPEAKER_03]: 1up.com.

899
01:14:38,807 --> 01:14:43,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they have a lot of the... It's very fan-oriented where you can have your own blogger and you can have a club.

900
01:14:43,820 --> 01:14:48,381
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually have an Orange Lounge Radio Club over on 1UP.com that Rice Princess started.

901
01:14:48,401 --> 01:14:50,802
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll have to put the link in the chatroom for that for those guys who haven't seen it yet.

902
01:14:51,262 --> 01:14:52,022
[SPEAKER_03]: The Orange Lounge Radio Club.

903
01:14:54,123 --> 01:14:56,483
[SPEAKER_03]: They also show how games are ranked.

904
01:14:57,183 --> 01:14:58,864
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, the ranking for various games.

905
01:14:59,264 --> 01:15:06,826
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was surprised because I have in every Xbox title that I own and Ultramix 2 was like the lowest ranked one on the list.

906
01:15:06,906 --> 01:15:09,606
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was kind of like, that's so sad because it's such a great game.

907
01:15:10,727 --> 01:15:12,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really a gem of a title.

908
01:15:13,061 --> 01:15:20,104
[SPEAKER_12]: It is, but then again, you know, a place like that, when fans come to congregate, it's going to be a lot of the casual fans.

909
01:15:20,424 --> 01:15:27,088
[SPEAKER_12]: And, of course, games like Halo and Gran Turismo and Grand Theft Auto and Metal Gear, they're all going to be in the top ranks.

910
01:15:27,108 --> 01:15:27,628
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, exactly.

911
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:36,972
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the top three right now, it's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Halo 2, and The Legend of Zelda, the brand new one, because of that, you know, trailer that came out this week.

912
01:15:36,992 --> 01:15:37,933
[SPEAKER_12]: The Legend of Zelda shocked me, but...

913
01:15:39,253 --> 01:15:40,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw that.

914
01:15:41,214 --> 01:15:42,315
[SPEAKER_12]: That was a very good trailer.

915
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:44,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, remember the trailer that came out this week.

916
01:15:44,176 --> 01:15:44,516
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.

917
01:15:44,536 --> 01:15:46,137
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you guys saw the Zelda trailer this week?

918
01:15:47,178 --> 01:15:47,718
[SPEAKER_19]: I haven't yet.

919
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:49,059
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to show it to you.

920
01:15:49,079 --> 01:15:49,540
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been busy.

921
01:15:49,860 --> 01:15:51,221
[SPEAKER_03]: After the show tonight, I have to show it to you.

922
01:15:52,621 --> 01:15:55,883
[SPEAKER_03]: It will just make you tingle in places you didn't know could tingle.

923
01:15:57,064 --> 01:15:59,626
[SPEAKER_12]: Two words can describe the trailer.

924
01:16:00,026 --> 01:16:01,707
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy and what's the other one?

925
01:16:01,747 --> 01:16:02,227
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, crap.

926
01:16:02,267 --> 01:16:02,788
[SPEAKER_12]: Holy crap.

927
01:16:03,789 --> 01:16:06,751
[SPEAKER_03]: or other various explicitives that you might be able to get.

928
01:16:07,151 --> 01:16:07,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, of course.

929
01:16:07,552 --> 01:16:11,494
[SPEAKER_12]: Including the omission of bodily functions that I think I'll just stop there on.

930
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:12,955
[SPEAKER_03]: What, DarkSakura?

931
01:16:13,055 --> 01:16:13,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Explicitives?

932
01:16:14,516 --> 01:16:15,677
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't you mean expletives?

933
01:16:15,697 --> 01:16:16,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, expletives.

934
01:16:18,419 --> 01:16:20,280
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to add that to the dictionary of Rob.

935
01:16:22,540 --> 01:16:28,262
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I'm on internet radio, boys and girls, because, you know, these things, I can't get into real radio.

936
01:16:28,282 --> 01:16:30,603
[SPEAKER_03]: I can never break into real radio because of my pronunciation problems.

937
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:39,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that was a new song by Britney Spears that was toxic here on... You put the wrong emphasis on the wrong syllables, guy.

938
01:16:39,646 --> 01:16:40,487
[SPEAKER_12]: You need to work on that.

939
01:16:43,187 --> 01:16:44,128
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, I'm learning.

940
01:16:44,268 --> 01:16:44,628
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

941
01:16:45,048 --> 01:16:47,229
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you want to share with us, El Mullet?

942
01:16:48,703 --> 01:16:55,965
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, if you see a piece a little down the line on In The Groove on our site, I'll be responsible for that.

943
01:16:56,685 --> 01:16:57,946
[SPEAKER_03]: Ooh, I can't wait to see that.

944
01:16:58,326 --> 01:16:59,726
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I'm going to say on it.

945
01:16:59,806 --> 01:17:02,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Knowing that you wrote it makes me very excited.

946
01:17:03,107 --> 01:17:06,368
[SPEAKER_12]: What it is and in what capacity, I'm not at liberty to say at this point.

947
01:17:06,508 --> 01:17:06,808
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

948
01:17:08,148 --> 01:17:08,468
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.

949
01:17:08,869 --> 01:17:09,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

950
01:17:09,929 --> 01:17:10,549
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be looking for it.

951
01:17:11,129 --> 01:17:11,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk to you later, Sky.

952
01:17:11,909 --> 01:17:12,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one, Mullet.

953
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:13,430
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.

954
01:17:13,570 --> 01:17:13,790
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

955
01:17:14,741 --> 01:17:15,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, hey, hey, it's Ranma from New York.

956
01:17:15,942 --> 01:17:16,522
[SPEAKER_03]: How you guys doing?

957
01:17:16,542 --> 01:17:17,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing pretty good.

958
01:17:17,182 --> 01:17:18,443
[SPEAKER_03]: Glad to hear you guys one more time.

959
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:18,623
[SPEAKER_03]: Not much.

960
01:17:18,643 --> 01:17:22,265
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been telling DarkSakura for a while I had a little surprise for her.

961
01:17:22,305 --> 01:17:23,866
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm posting the links now in the chat room.

962
01:17:41,484 --> 01:17:42,845
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to bring them up on the computer over here.

963
01:17:43,105 --> 01:17:45,706
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get them on your laptop over there, right, DarkSakura?

964
01:17:45,726 --> 01:17:46,407
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, I'm looking.

965
01:17:46,947 --> 01:17:48,688
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm putting them in, too, because I want to see what it is.

966
01:17:48,708 --> 01:17:53,870
[SPEAKER_03]: So DJ Ranma S is posting this in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, clicking on chat.

967
01:17:54,631 --> 01:17:55,691
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, is that a picture of you, buddy?

968
01:17:56,832 --> 01:18:00,173
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're kicking an old arcade machine.

969
01:18:02,594 --> 01:18:04,315
[SPEAKER_03]: That's awesome.

970
01:18:05,056 --> 01:18:07,977
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't mind, we want to put that in our Orange Lounge Radio photo gallery.

971
01:18:08,601 --> 01:18:09,142
[SPEAKER_04]: Go right ahead.

972
01:18:09,162 --> 01:18:09,762
[SPEAKER_04]: That is rad.

973
01:18:09,842 --> 01:18:15,668
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we need to start a photo gallery on OrangeLoungeRadio.com of people kicking Ultracade machines.

974
01:18:16,529 --> 01:18:17,329
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that idea.

975
01:18:18,490 --> 01:18:19,111
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to do that.

976
01:18:19,171 --> 01:18:21,433
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll even set up an email where you can email your picks.

977
01:18:21,593 --> 01:18:22,414
[SPEAKER_19]: That is awesome.

978
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:24,816
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'll be the first one in there, buddy.

979
01:18:25,217 --> 01:18:25,817
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.

980
01:18:25,857 --> 01:18:26,438
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey, no fair.

981
01:18:26,478 --> 01:18:27,699
[SPEAKER_19]: You have an Alpine Racer 2.

982
01:18:28,059 --> 01:18:28,880
[SPEAKER_19]: I miss that game.

983
01:18:29,901 --> 01:18:32,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you ever come to New York, I'll bring it to the arcade where you can play it.

984
01:18:33,686 --> 01:18:34,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

985
01:18:34,366 --> 01:18:35,587
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I have that plane ticket, please?

986
01:18:35,607 --> 01:18:39,009
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, that arcade reminds me of Miggle, kind of, for some reason.

987
01:18:39,049 --> 01:18:39,789
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what it is.

988
01:18:40,530 --> 01:18:40,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting.

989
01:18:40,910 --> 01:18:46,413
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's another... So there's a picture of him kicking the top and a picture of him kicking the coin slot.

990
01:18:46,613 --> 01:18:46,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

991
01:18:47,374 --> 01:18:48,074
[SPEAKER_04]: That is so rad.

992
01:18:48,134 --> 01:18:52,777
[SPEAKER_04]: I was trying to go for a better kick, but manager came by.

993
01:18:52,817 --> 01:18:56,018
[SPEAKER_04]: We just kind of hightailed out of there.

994
01:18:56,519 --> 01:19:02,382
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, everybody out there, before I encourage you to run out there and kick all the Ultra Kade machines in the planet...

995
01:19:03,012 --> 01:19:04,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Be careful, okay?

996
01:19:04,973 --> 01:19:08,436
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't actually damage the machine because you can get in trouble for that.

997
01:19:08,456 --> 01:19:13,479
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to get sued because somebody, you know, we had recommended that you kick an Ultracade machine.

998
01:19:13,899 --> 01:19:19,924
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get in trouble for kicking an Ultracade machine, I will say that I knew nothing about it.

999
01:19:20,044 --> 01:19:21,445
[SPEAKER_03]: And we never told you to do anything.

1000
01:19:21,565 --> 01:19:22,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So don't get in trouble.

1001
01:19:23,486 --> 01:19:23,886
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

1002
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:25,187
[SPEAKER_04]: You got the disclaimer up and running.

1003
01:19:25,267 --> 01:19:25,567
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1004
01:19:25,627 --> 01:19:26,108
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.

1005
01:19:26,288 --> 01:19:27,268
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wanted to share with us?

1006
01:19:27,309 --> 01:19:27,949
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great, though.

1007
01:19:28,775 --> 01:19:32,256
[SPEAKER_04]: One more thing, I went out and bought a Donald J. Trump doll Friday night.

1008
01:19:35,456 --> 01:19:36,557
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in New York.

1009
01:19:37,497 --> 01:19:38,337
[SPEAKER_03]: What is this about?

1010
01:19:38,777 --> 01:19:40,758
[SPEAKER_03]: What made you decide to get a Donald J. Trump doll?

1011
01:19:41,498 --> 01:19:48,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, me and my friends, we went out for dinner, and before we decided to play DDR, there's a big Toys R Us in Times Square.

1012
01:19:48,539 --> 01:19:52,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We went over, walked around, we found some great stuff.

1013
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:55,801
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a picture in my gallery of Toys R Us misspelling Gundam with an H.

1014
01:19:57,972 --> 01:20:01,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't that Toys R Us, the one that was in an episode of The Apprentice as well?

1015
01:20:01,857 --> 01:20:02,277
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

1016
01:20:02,317 --> 01:20:02,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, okay.

1017
01:20:02,978 --> 01:20:04,120
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a famous Toys R Us.

1018
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:04,881
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm.

1019
01:20:05,682 --> 01:20:05,962
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1020
01:20:07,003 --> 01:20:10,307
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, we got dragged over to the Barbie section.

1021
01:20:10,327 --> 01:20:11,168
[SPEAKER_04]: We're walking around.

1022
01:20:11,229 --> 01:20:13,071
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the guys was like, check this out.

1023
01:20:13,231 --> 01:20:15,634
[SPEAKER_04]: He picked up the doll, and I was like, I bought it.

1024
01:20:16,184 --> 01:20:20,285
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a picture of me in the gallery worshipping the doll because it was like the best thing in the Barbie section.

1025
01:20:21,165 --> 01:20:23,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, so they had the Donald Trump doll in the Barbie section?

1026
01:20:23,986 --> 01:20:24,326
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1027
01:20:24,766 --> 01:20:25,606
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that all about?

1028
01:20:25,646 --> 01:20:26,346
[SPEAKER_03]: That's very interesting.

1029
01:20:26,386 --> 01:20:26,806
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1030
01:20:27,686 --> 01:20:30,267
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does have this one interesting quote.

1031
01:20:30,287 --> 01:20:31,287
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope you guys can hear it.

1032
01:20:31,547 --> 01:20:31,867
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1033
01:20:35,508 --> 01:20:36,288
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I couldn't hear it.

1034
01:20:36,328 --> 01:20:36,948
[SPEAKER_03]: What was it saying?

1035
01:20:37,848 --> 01:20:40,189
[SPEAKER_04]: I have no choice to tell you, but you're fired.

1036
01:20:40,349 --> 01:20:41,729
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, beautiful.

1037
01:20:41,809 --> 01:20:45,230
[SPEAKER_04]: And to answer the question in the chat room, that is Laser Park in New York City.

1038
01:20:45,783 --> 01:20:46,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, very cool.

1039
01:20:46,864 --> 01:20:47,304
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1040
01:20:47,825 --> 01:20:55,431
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, Ranma, thank you very much for the pictures, and I think you've started a new trend here on Orange Lounge, so we're going to get on that after tonight's show, doing the Ultracade Kicking Gallery.

1041
01:20:56,212 --> 01:20:57,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm here to help any way possible.

1042
01:20:57,953 --> 01:21:00,075
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so get your friends to do it and take pictures of them.

1043
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:01,636
[SPEAKER_04]: I plan on it.

1044
01:21:01,676 --> 01:21:02,437
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sounds good.

1045
01:21:03,858 --> 01:21:04,419
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, cool.

1046
01:21:04,499 --> 01:21:05,199
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, have a good one, buddy.

1047
01:21:05,219 --> 01:21:06,020
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to get some more calls.

1048
01:21:06,540 --> 01:21:07,201
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, take care.

1049
01:21:07,221 --> 01:21:07,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1050
01:21:07,521 --> 01:21:07,842
[SPEAKER_03]: Later.

1051
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,785
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, one more call, you guys, and we're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1052
01:21:12,065 --> 01:21:13,046
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1053
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku.

1054
01:21:20,766 --> 01:21:22,306
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, a couple of things.

1055
01:21:22,646 --> 01:21:29,448
[SPEAKER_06]: One, let me see, a tournament I went to this weekend and just basically drama, drama, and damage and drama.

1056
01:21:29,468 --> 01:21:32,789
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a local tournament in the Bronx, you know, where I'm from.

1057
01:21:32,809 --> 01:21:33,249
[SPEAKER_03]: And apparently...

1058
01:21:38,720 --> 01:21:46,925
[SPEAKER_06]: The locals in the arcade there basically got pissed off at, you know, the people out, you know, the outside players for basically being good at them.

1059
01:21:47,185 --> 01:21:49,506
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, beating the crap out of them in, you know, the tournament.

1060
01:21:50,106 --> 01:21:55,109
[SPEAKER_06]: And they got so childish that they brought like six or seven people that, you know, they were about to beat the shit out of them.

1061
01:21:55,990 --> 01:22:07,036
[SPEAKER_06]: That's how bad... Well, you're breaking up a little bit there, buddy, but... Right now, you'll see the locked thread that resulted in this.

1062
01:22:07,822 --> 01:22:14,465
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you're breaking up a little bit, but clarify this for me.

1063
01:22:16,346 --> 01:22:17,747
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he might be a little bit delayed here.

1064
01:22:17,887 --> 01:22:18,887
[SPEAKER_03]: So, clarify this for me.

1065
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:24,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Some folks beat some other folks up over DDR, is what you're saying.

1066
01:22:28,332 --> 01:22:28,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's delayed.

1067
01:22:29,172 --> 01:22:30,833
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, okay.

1068
01:22:31,173 --> 01:22:34,655
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, these people, the people here...

1069
01:22:35,928 --> 01:22:37,669
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really breaking up there.

1070
01:22:37,729 --> 01:22:41,051
[SPEAKER_06]: You're really, really breaking up there, buddy.

1071
01:22:41,772 --> 01:22:43,353
[SPEAKER_06]: They take DDR too seriously.

1072
01:22:44,954 --> 01:22:46,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you know what?

1073
01:22:46,355 --> 01:22:48,536
[SPEAKER_03]: They take DDR too seriously.

1074
01:22:48,936 --> 01:22:53,339
[SPEAKER_03]: DDR is nothing to want to even think about beating somebody up over.

1075
01:22:53,659 --> 01:22:58,022
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I would say that serving people over a DDR tournament, that's okay.

1076
01:22:58,082 --> 01:23:00,644
[SPEAKER_03]: You can serve people, but don't beat them up.

1077
01:23:01,004 --> 01:23:02,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, but they take...

1078
01:23:03,203 --> 01:23:09,704
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but the thing is that they took it seriously as they compared, they almost made it, you know, compared it as to like a sporting event.

1079
01:23:10,445 --> 01:23:16,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they were just basically, you know, distracting, embarrassing the other players and not the regulars there.

1080
01:23:17,146 --> 01:23:19,407
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of like, that's where the drama erupted from.

1081
01:23:20,027 --> 01:23:25,808
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the regular good players had to like, you know, show them their place by basically showing off in order to show them how it felt like.

1082
01:23:26,008 --> 01:23:30,109
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, all I have to say... They basically ignored it, you know, in the past couple of tournaments there...

1083
01:23:30,657 --> 01:23:30,817
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1084
01:23:30,837 --> 01:23:31,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

1085
01:23:40,385 --> 01:23:54,075
[SPEAKER_06]: As you can see the post from DDR Freak that I gave you, Sketch, you know, who's basically almost like a household name within the community because, you know, he's one of the best in the city, if not the state or the east coast.

1086
01:23:54,755 --> 01:24:00,959
[SPEAKER_06]: He was there in attendance yesterday and he pointed out, he basically, he told them politely that he just, you know, he finds those people rude.

1087
01:24:02,000 --> 01:24:06,063
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, they basically went on rampage by insulting his group.

1088
01:24:06,960 --> 01:24:08,923
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

1089
01:24:17,048 --> 01:24:17,248
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1090
01:24:17,828 --> 01:24:26,130
[SPEAKER_03]: Buddy, you're... My friend, you're breaking up over there, so I'm gonna... Zaku, I know you're still trying to talk, but we can't understand you because you're breaking up, buddy.

1091
01:24:26,230 --> 01:24:30,031
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna have to go ahead and let you go, but we'll talk a little bit more about this, so keep listening, Zaku.

1092
01:24:30,051 --> 01:24:31,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate the update on the tournament, okay, bud?

1093
01:24:32,272 --> 01:24:33,432
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.

1094
01:24:33,772 --> 01:24:36,313
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel bad that I had to let him go, but he was just breaking up really bad there.

1095
01:24:37,473 --> 01:24:41,314
[SPEAKER_03]: So... I don't know.

1096
01:24:41,474 --> 01:24:42,974
[SPEAKER_03]: Why would you want to do this?

1097
01:24:44,014 --> 01:24:46,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, if you go to a DDR tournament...

1098
01:24:47,356 --> 01:24:56,763
[SPEAKER_03]: It is going to be a... And I explicit, by the way, walked in during that phone call, so he's kind of picked up most of that call, and he's run a lot of tournaments and has had to deal with some of this drama.

1099
01:24:56,983 --> 01:24:58,984
[SPEAKER_03]: So I know you've got something you want to share on this.

1100
01:24:59,445 --> 01:25:06,590
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you go to a DDR tournament, you should expect that there are going to be people there who are better than you.

1101
01:25:07,190 --> 01:25:10,292
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would you want to beat them up because they're better than you?

1102
01:25:10,853 --> 01:25:14,916
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, I understand this is a human nature that people do not want to lose.

1103
01:25:15,880 --> 01:25:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: or people looking out over some other dude's girlfriend or so forth.

1104
01:25:20,464 --> 01:25:36,696
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a lot of nonsense, but I mean, I've been through numerous tournaments myself, maybe like 18 tournaments so far total, and never have I seen anybody fight physically in a tournament, but if this were true...

1105
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:40,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I just had to tell people that just grow up, basically.

1106
01:25:40,325 --> 01:25:42,226
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't actually do the physical fight.

1107
01:25:42,246 --> 01:25:43,027
[SPEAKER_03]: I clarified that.

1108
01:25:43,047 --> 01:25:45,548
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't actually get into a fight, but, you know, get in there.

1109
01:25:45,728 --> 01:25:47,449
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there.

1110
01:25:48,390 --> 01:25:51,531
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember there was one time that I saw a fight over DER.

1111
01:25:51,731 --> 01:25:52,672
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my gosh.

1112
01:25:53,252 --> 01:25:55,313
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the CCO like two years ago in July.

1113
01:25:55,333 --> 01:25:56,314
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so lame.

1114
01:25:56,334 --> 01:25:57,454
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so lame.

1115
01:25:59,515 --> 01:26:01,596
[SPEAKER_03]: And what was the honest reason?

1116
01:26:02,257 --> 01:26:05,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, my God, you got one more perfect than me, bastard.

1117
01:26:05,719 --> 01:26:06,219
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, because...

1118
01:26:06,877 --> 01:26:15,243
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing is, at the time I was there, well, the person who was playing, like, Demon Road got to Max Unlimited.

1119
01:26:15,943 --> 01:26:21,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Then some guy was just, you know, messing around, thinking it would be okay to screw his game up.

1120
01:26:21,627 --> 01:26:22,047
[SPEAKER_21]: Gotcha.

1121
01:26:22,567 --> 01:26:22,808
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1122
01:26:22,868 --> 01:26:23,888
[SPEAKER_05]: Then, of course, the fight.

1123
01:26:24,068 --> 01:26:26,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Spilled coke over the DDR pads in the group.

1124
01:26:27,471 --> 01:26:28,972
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, now the in-the-group pads.

1125
01:26:29,112 --> 01:26:29,332
[SPEAKER_21]: Right.

1126
01:26:29,812 --> 01:26:30,713
[SPEAKER_05]: That was two years ago, so.

1127
01:26:30,753 --> 01:26:30,993
[SPEAKER_05]: Horrible.

1128
01:26:32,134 --> 01:26:32,434
[SPEAKER_21]: Horrible.

1129
01:26:33,470 --> 01:26:37,373
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, well, you guys that are going to DDR tournaments, don't start drama.

1130
01:26:37,794 --> 01:26:40,776
[SPEAKER_03]: You give the rest of us a bad name, and we will find you and beat you up.

1131
01:26:40,796 --> 01:26:42,618
[SPEAKER_03]: I set your ass on fire.

1132
01:26:42,638 --> 01:26:43,899
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, your mic's off there, I think.

1133
01:26:44,740 --> 01:26:47,142
[SPEAKER_19]: You start drama, I set your ass on fire.

1134
01:26:47,262 --> 01:26:47,762
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.

1135
01:26:47,802 --> 01:26:51,185
[SPEAKER_19]: So you can start drama if you want to die.

1136
01:26:52,406 --> 01:26:52,987
[SPEAKER_19]: That'd be cool.

1137
01:26:53,447 --> 01:26:55,229
[SPEAKER_19]: I need an excuse to set people on fire, you know.

1138
01:26:55,629 --> 01:26:56,089
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.

1139
01:26:56,330 --> 01:26:57,130
[SPEAKER_03]: You like the fire.

1140
01:26:57,511 --> 01:26:57,971
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that.

1141
01:26:58,792 --> 01:26:59,112
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1142
01:26:59,721 --> 01:27:02,303
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match now, you guys.

1143
01:27:02,323 --> 01:27:04,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you guys that didn't get through on the Skype line, try again a little later.

1144
01:27:04,984 --> 01:27:07,005
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll hopefully open that up again a little bit later.

1145
01:27:07,646 --> 01:27:08,666
[SPEAKER_03]: After Listless as well.

1146
01:27:08,686 --> 01:27:11,448
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to fill you in on tonight's Listless topic because we're going to do that.

1147
01:27:11,468 --> 01:27:11,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay.

1148
01:27:12,068 --> 01:27:12,369
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1149
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,410
[SPEAKER_03]: And your DS is here as well.

1150
01:27:15,430 --> 01:27:15,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I know.

1151
01:27:15,791 --> 01:27:16,551
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot.

1152
01:27:17,312 --> 01:27:19,873
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure it's yours because there's like three of them around here somewhere.

1153
01:27:19,893 --> 01:27:21,614
[SPEAKER_03]: It says explicit with three X's.

1154
01:27:21,694 --> 01:27:22,034
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.

1155
01:27:22,094 --> 01:27:22,395
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1156
01:27:22,735 --> 01:27:27,498
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're in just under the 30-day rule because if something's here for 30 days, we keep it.

1157
01:27:28,919 --> 01:27:30,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry about it.

1158
01:27:30,381 --> 01:27:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: I have PM to Loki.

1159
01:27:33,004 --> 01:27:33,505
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

1160
01:27:33,545 --> 01:27:33,985
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all good.

1161
01:27:34,346 --> 01:27:34,626
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1162
01:27:35,127 --> 01:27:37,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match right now.

1163
01:27:39,653 --> 01:27:43,094
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the cage match works, you've got to be in our chat room to play.

1164
01:27:43,374 --> 01:27:46,114
[SPEAKER_03]: www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat.

1165
01:27:46,535 --> 01:27:49,495
[SPEAKER_03]: And the way the cage match works, we play three songs for you guys.

1166
01:27:50,735 --> 01:27:56,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week's winner, we play a clip of that song, and then we play two new songs for you guys, okay?

1167
01:27:56,677 --> 01:28:06,719
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to do that, and you guys are going to vote on your favorite, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program.

1168
01:28:07,319 --> 01:28:15,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Last week in the Orange Launch Radio Cage Match, Ayumi Hamasaki was the winner with a System F remix of a song called Kanaria.

1169
01:28:15,461 --> 01:28:18,081
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's the song that DarkSakura picked.

1170
01:28:18,441 --> 01:28:20,882
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sounds like Gonorrhea, but it's Kanaria.

1171
01:28:22,462 --> 01:28:26,123
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, but it's actually, this song is much, much better than Gonorrhea could ever be.

1172
01:28:26,223 --> 01:28:27,263
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to get into that.

1173
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:30,264
[SPEAKER_03]: Here it is, a clip of song number one.

1174
01:28:30,304 --> 01:28:32,484
[SPEAKER_03]: You only get to hear a clip because it was last week's winner.

1175
01:28:32,504 --> 01:28:35,025
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, a clip, Ayumi Hamasaki, song number one.

1176
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,286
Thank you for watching!

1177
01:30:20,134 --> 01:30:21,914
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was a clip of song number one.

1178
01:30:22,095 --> 01:30:24,395
[SPEAKER_03]: You can vote for it tonight, Ayumi Hamasaki.

1179
01:30:24,495 --> 01:30:26,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number two is Loki's pick.

1180
01:30:26,596 --> 01:30:27,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, what did you pick for us tonight?

1181
01:30:28,416 --> 01:30:29,256
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another song.

1182
01:30:29,316 --> 01:30:31,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a remix of Xenon.

1183
01:30:32,337 --> 01:30:35,298
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Xenon the halogen mix and it's done by G-Drop.

1184
01:30:36,498 --> 01:30:39,599
[SPEAKER_02]: I found it on some video game mix site or something.

1185
01:30:41,080 --> 01:30:42,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so here it is.

1186
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:46,021
[SPEAKER_03]: A remix of Xenon is song number two tonight in the cage match.

1187
01:30:46,081 --> 01:30:46,381
[SPEAKER_03]: Enjoy.

1188
01:30:54,497 --> 01:30:55,278
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1189
01:31:03,021 --> 01:31:04,983
Thank you for watching!

1190
01:32:24,310 --> 01:32:25,571
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

1191
01:32:50,192 --> 01:32:51,533
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you for watching!

1192
01:34:01,549 --> 01:34:02,470
Thanks for watching!

1193
01:35:29,154 --> 01:35:34,278
[SPEAKER_03]: All righty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Beat Drop with Xenon, the Halogen Mix.

1194
01:35:34,698 --> 01:35:41,523
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're going to go around in our really bad impersonation of American Idol and tell you guys what we thought of that, although we're not the ones who get to choose.

1195
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:42,764
[SPEAKER_03]: It's you guys in the chat room.

1196
01:35:43,084 --> 01:35:43,665
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.

1197
01:35:44,305 --> 01:35:49,449
[SPEAKER_19]: It sounded like someone took Xenon, which was by itself a really good song, and dropped it and beat it.

1198
01:35:50,290 --> 01:35:51,191
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

1199
01:35:52,427 --> 01:35:53,668
[SPEAKER_19]: I didn't like the sampling at all.

1200
01:35:53,788 --> 01:35:58,292
[SPEAKER_19]: Sounded like it was done through a telephone or a Game Boy.

1201
01:36:00,373 --> 01:36:11,123
[SPEAKER_19]: There were parts of it I thought were okay, but honestly I just couldn't get past it sounding like it was done through like a phonograph speaker underwater.

1202
01:36:12,003 --> 01:36:12,804
[SPEAKER_19]: So it gets a two.

1203
01:36:14,205 --> 01:36:14,746
[SPEAKER_03]: Explicit.

1204
01:36:16,519 --> 01:36:30,831
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it's a pretty good song, I mean, there's some, like DarkSakura said, there's some parts I just don't feel would be necessary, which is like, I'll give it a 6, but since it's not a Max Remix, I'll give it, I'll give it a plus 1 point, a 7.

1205
01:36:32,192 --> 01:36:37,776
[SPEAKER_17]: Angel It was okay, I still like the original better, 6.5 Loki

1206
01:36:41,494 --> 01:36:41,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Me,

1207
01:37:11,095 --> 01:37:11,796
[SPEAKER_03]: Hated it.

1208
01:37:12,056 --> 01:37:12,296
[SPEAKER_03]: Three.

1209
01:37:13,036 --> 01:37:17,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, but I'm going to give it a bonus point for not being a Max Remix as well, so it gets a four.

1210
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to my song tonight.

1211
01:37:21,362 --> 01:37:27,447
[SPEAKER_03]: My song is actually an old-ass song, but they did, like, this new remix of it last year.

1212
01:37:27,867 --> 01:37:31,570
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to pick this song, because this song was rad, and I kind of like this new remix.

1213
01:37:31,590 --> 01:37:32,450
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, it really grew on me.

1214
01:37:32,490 --> 01:37:33,831
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been listening to it a lot in my car.

1215
01:37:34,292 --> 01:37:37,474
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and everybody out here knows this song.

1216
01:37:37,534 --> 01:37:38,895
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a group called Hadaway.

1217
01:37:41,228 --> 01:37:42,869
[SPEAKER_03]: What is love?

1218
01:37:42,949 --> 01:37:59,181
[SPEAKER_14]: Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more Baby, don't hurt me, don't hurt me no more

1219
01:38:13,131 --> 01:38:15,096
What is love?

1220
01:38:50,720 --> 01:38:52,221
Thank you for watching!

1221
01:39:47,638 --> 01:39:48,359
[SPEAKER_13]: DarkSakura.com

1222
01:40:14,403 --> 01:40:16,306
Don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

1223
01:40:50,498 --> 01:40:52,659
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1224
01:40:52,879 --> 01:40:55,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Hadaway with What Is Love, Reloaded.

1225
01:40:56,201 --> 01:41:00,223
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see what the folks in the room thought of that one, starting off with DarkSakura.

1226
01:41:02,224 --> 01:41:06,427
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry, but even remixed, that song still gets on my nerves just because it was so damn overplayed.

1227
01:41:08,408 --> 01:41:12,810
[SPEAKER_19]: Where I would give the original a five, that one was slightly better, so I would give it a six and a half.

1228
01:41:13,771 --> 01:41:15,872
[SPEAKER_19]: Just because I heard it way too much.

1229
01:41:17,153 --> 01:41:17,593
[SPEAKER_05]: Explicit!

1230
01:41:18,699 --> 01:41:20,260
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to agree with DarkSakura.

1231
01:41:21,141 --> 01:41:22,402
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a little overplayed.

1232
01:41:22,763 --> 01:41:26,546
[SPEAKER_05]: And this remix, I don't know, it just sounds just the same as the original for some reason.

1233
01:41:27,606 --> 01:41:31,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Not really much has been done, just because of the reloaded sign-in to it.

1234
01:41:32,430 --> 01:41:32,831
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll give it a 6.8.

1235
01:41:32,871 --> 01:41:32,831
6.8.

1236
01:41:32,911 --> 01:41:36,254
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, give it an extra .1 so we can have a 6.9 explicit.

1237
01:41:36,454 --> 01:41:37,515
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you say?

1238
01:41:42,662 --> 01:41:43,222
[SPEAKER_19]: I'll give it the .1.

1239
01:41:43,643 --> 01:41:47,085
[SPEAKER_05]: Man, what is this going to have to do?

1240
01:41:47,725 --> 01:41:48,245
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't matter.

1241
01:41:48,265 --> 01:41:49,146
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, Angel.

1242
01:41:50,727 --> 01:41:51,267
[SPEAKER_17]: I liked it.

1243
01:41:53,928 --> 01:41:55,309
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, because it's 80s and stuff.

1244
01:41:55,329 --> 01:41:55,629
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

1245
01:41:55,649 --> 01:41:57,971
[SPEAKER_17]: It kind of had an extra little beat to it.

1246
01:41:59,552 --> 01:42:00,692
[SPEAKER_17]: God, this mic is loud.

1247
01:42:00,752 --> 01:42:01,192
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1248
01:42:24,511 --> 01:42:33,255
[SPEAKER_02]: A new bass, you know, a stronger bass drum and a stronger synth line does not a new... It's just, no.

1249
01:42:34,256 --> 01:42:35,777
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a remix, it's just crap.

1250
01:42:35,877 --> 01:42:37,517
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same damn song all over again.

1251
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:39,538
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the original, and they fucked it up.

1252
01:42:39,638 --> 01:42:43,680
[SPEAKER_02]: They went and made it into a Hard House track, and it's not supposed to be.

1253
01:42:44,361 --> 01:42:49,043
[SPEAKER_02]: It lost everything I liked about the original, and it just sounds like a really shitty cover of it.

1254
01:42:49,543 --> 01:42:50,684
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it gets a 4.

1255
01:42:53,363 --> 01:43:00,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know what, I kind of like it because that song's been kind of gone for a little while now that Night at the Roxbury isn't on Saturday Night Live anymore.

1256
01:43:00,606 --> 01:43:04,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, you know, so I kind of think it was time for that song to come back.

1257
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:07,608
[SPEAKER_03]: And what I really like about that remix is that it's under three minutes.

1258
01:43:08,048 --> 01:43:11,729
[SPEAKER_03]: So whilst the beat in the background is a little repetitive, the song knows when to quit.

1259
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:13,230
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of like that.

1260
01:43:13,330 --> 01:43:15,911
[SPEAKER_03]: So I like that song, so I will give it an eight.

1261
01:43:16,511 --> 01:43:16,811
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1262
01:43:17,754 --> 01:43:20,957
[SPEAKER_03]: But however, remember, it is not up to us, it's up to you guys.

1263
01:43:21,177 --> 01:43:25,520
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys get the final say, so here it is, a reminder of the three songs you get to vote for tonight.

1264
01:43:25,901 --> 01:43:28,483
[SPEAKER_03]: Song number one, Ayumi Hamasaki, Kanaria.

1265
01:43:37,270 --> 01:43:40,753
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number two you can vote for tonight, Beat Drop with a Zenon Remix.

1266
01:43:49,049 --> 01:43:53,212
[SPEAKER_03]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, Hataway, What Is Love, Reloaded.

1267
01:44:02,179 --> 01:44:05,241
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, place vote now.

1268
01:44:05,361 --> 01:44:13,067
[SPEAKER_03]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1269
01:44:13,107 --> 01:44:17,310
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tally them up over the next break and let you guys know the winner very soon.

1270
01:44:18,965 --> 01:44:26,387
[SPEAKER_03]: What I've been plugging a little bit tonight, and I'm going to post it one more time in the chat room for those of you guys that haven't had a chance to look at it yet.

1271
01:44:26,807 --> 01:44:35,309
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm posting a link to our LiveJournal community, and it's actually a post in that LiveJournal community, and you do not have to be a member of the community to read it.

1272
01:44:35,329 --> 01:44:36,649
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even have to be a LiveJournal member.

1273
01:44:36,989 --> 01:44:47,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Just go ahead and click on that link, because what is in that is instructions on how to vote for us in the Best of Live 365 competition that's going on right now, how to get us nominated.

1274
01:44:48,092 --> 01:44:49,852
[SPEAKER_03]: and I know what some of you guys are thinking.

1275
01:44:50,272 --> 01:44:53,573
[SPEAKER_03]: Why does Orange Lounge Radio want to get nominated for one of those silly award shows?

1276
01:44:54,453 --> 01:44:56,094
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because we like attention.

1277
01:44:56,194 --> 01:44:56,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh.

1278
01:44:56,614 --> 01:45:00,074
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, DarkSakura, can you disagree with me there?

1279
01:45:00,415 --> 01:45:01,095
[SPEAKER_03]: Attention's great.

1280
01:45:02,015 --> 01:45:03,515
[SPEAKER_19]: We are whores for attention.

1281
01:45:03,575 --> 01:45:04,375
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.

1282
01:45:04,395 --> 01:45:06,976
[SPEAKER_19]: We will totally just make utter sluts of ourselves for attention.

1283
01:45:06,996 --> 01:45:11,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the link right there for the Podcast Alley vote thing?

1284
01:45:11,337 --> 01:45:12,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yes, we'll post that as well.

1285
01:45:12,677 --> 01:45:13,537
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll post that a little later.

1286
01:45:13,577 --> 01:45:17,738
[SPEAKER_03]: I want people to do this first, but we'll do the Podcast Alley thing later because we're trying to get our

1287
01:45:18,078 --> 01:45:19,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for watching!

1288
01:45:38,380 --> 01:45:43,264
[SPEAKER_03]: I think really in doing this, because you have to remember there is all sorts of stations on Live365.

1289
01:45:43,284 --> 01:45:43,744
[SPEAKER_03]: There's what, like 60,000?

1290
01:45:43,864 --> 01:45:48,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's incredible the amount of stations that are on Live365.

1291
01:45:48,748 --> 01:45:55,592
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a DDR talk video game music station to get nominated, that's really cool.

1292
01:45:55,612 --> 01:46:05,419
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it shows that there is an audience for this type of video game programming, where we're not talking about Madden, we're talking about Halo all the time.

1293
01:46:05,579 --> 01:46:07,741
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about other video games.

1294
01:46:08,383 --> 01:46:17,209
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're going to kind of notice that as the year goes on and Orange Lounge kind of slowly does this shift from just being a Bomani to Bomani and more.

1295
01:46:17,850 --> 01:46:21,513
[SPEAKER_03]: We just kind of want to show that there is a demand out there for this kind of niche.

1296
01:46:21,613 --> 01:46:29,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of Strictly, if you want to talk a Strictly Bomani-based radio station, our buddies over at DDR Freak, we're trying to help them out get a nomination as well.

1297
01:46:29,318 --> 01:46:32,601
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've been really good to us this year, especially with the whole syndication and everything.

1298
01:46:32,621 --> 01:46:34,183
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd like to see them get a nod as well.

1299
01:46:34,243 --> 01:46:36,865
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is all detailed for you guys in the live journal post.

1300
01:46:37,306 --> 01:46:41,369
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, our grandfather station, Understation Live, we're trying to get them a nod as well.

1301
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:44,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Without Understation Live, we would not be here, I do not think.

1302
01:46:45,833 --> 01:46:46,213
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that.

1303
01:46:46,453 --> 01:46:48,674
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope you guys will consider taking a second.

1304
01:46:49,014 --> 01:46:49,555
[SPEAKER_03]: It's free.

1305
01:46:49,855 --> 01:46:53,056
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys already have to have a Live365 account to listen to this show.

1306
01:46:53,136 --> 01:46:54,276
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've already got everything you need.

1307
01:46:54,296 --> 01:46:54,837
[SPEAKER_03]: So check that out.

1308
01:46:55,677 --> 01:47:00,239
[SPEAKER_03]: Those of you guys that are too shy to join our chat room, just go to our LiveJournal community.

1309
01:47:00,299 --> 01:47:04,240
[SPEAKER_03]: It's www.livejournal.com slash community slash orange lounge.

1310
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:07,141
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a link right there on orangelounge.com that says community.

1311
01:47:07,741 --> 01:47:09,242
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like what, the fourth post down?

1312
01:47:09,302 --> 01:47:12,023
[SPEAKER_03]: Just scroll down until you see the best of Live365 post.

1313
01:47:12,403 --> 01:47:13,984
[SPEAKER_03]: And we appreciate your support.

1314
01:47:15,845 --> 01:47:17,145
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so that's that.

1315
01:47:17,806 --> 01:47:28,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about a little bit of SimScene news, and usually this has kind of been a joke lately with all the sites being down, but I know, Loki, I know there's big news you're very excited about this week, so you've got to tell us about this in the SimScene update.

1316
01:47:29,331 --> 01:47:29,632
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

1317
01:47:30,092 --> 01:47:43,939
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, just like a lot of fan stuff out there that's being worked on, most of the stuff, of course, you'll always find is in Japan, and you really need to watch the Japanese sites, because that's where all the stuff's happening nowadays, since all the American stuff's down.

1318
01:47:44,821 --> 01:47:51,244
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, the one site whenever we're talking about Japanese Step Mania, the one thing you have to bring up is Food Mix.

1319
01:47:51,505 --> 01:47:55,867
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, it was announced this week that Food Mix 2 Advanced Edition will be coming out.

1320
01:47:56,647 --> 01:47:56,887
[SPEAKER_02]: When?

1321
01:47:56,947 --> 01:47:57,687
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.

1322
01:47:57,787 --> 01:47:58,127
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

1323
01:47:58,167 --> 01:48:00,008
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have a few screenshots up on their site.

1324
01:48:00,028 --> 01:48:02,308
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link on our front page to it.

1325
01:48:02,848 --> 01:48:03,669
[SPEAKER_02]: And go check it out.

1326
01:48:03,769 --> 01:48:04,889
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks good as ever.

1327
01:48:05,489 --> 01:48:06,989
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can't wait.

1328
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:09,130
[SPEAKER_02]: Tons of new stuff.

1329
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:11,951
[SPEAKER_02]: You know they're going to have stuff from diverse systems.

1330
01:48:12,791 --> 01:48:15,131
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always a great package once it's put together.

1331
01:48:15,591 --> 01:48:16,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other things that I might point out.

1332
01:48:17,232 --> 01:48:20,793
[SPEAKER_02]: In our forums, in the Orange Lodge Radio, I do have a link to...

1333
01:48:22,313 --> 01:48:24,234
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a theme called Pop Candy.

1334
01:48:24,614 --> 01:48:27,375
[SPEAKER_02]: The website that had it up originally went down.

1335
01:48:27,535 --> 01:48:31,216
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, I downloaded it a long-ass time ago, so I hosted it for you guys.

1336
01:48:31,596 --> 01:48:34,357
[SPEAKER_02]: You can go download that on OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

1337
01:48:34,397 --> 01:48:35,637
[SPEAKER_02]: Just check in the forums.

1338
01:48:35,777 --> 01:48:36,517
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find it.

1339
01:48:37,477 --> 01:48:42,719
[SPEAKER_02]: And other than that, there was the Siberia theme.

1340
01:48:42,979 --> 01:48:49,681
[SPEAKER_02]: 2.1 got released, and for those who don't know what that is, that's the Stepmania theme that looks sort of like

1341
01:48:50,439 --> 01:49:09,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Techno Fiend, it's the Japanese one, it does look very good, and I've actually switched this to my default theme, I like it a lot, and so definitely check that out as well, other than that, really, there's a whole thread on Belmonte Style, basically it's the fan mix,

1342
01:49:10,667 --> 01:49:11,267
[SPEAKER_02]: WatchThread

1343
01:49:41,710 --> 01:49:42,571
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1344
01:49:43,813 --> 01:49:47,038
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked Food Mix a whole heck of a lot, so I'm really excited about Food Mix too.

1345
01:49:47,078 --> 01:49:49,102
[SPEAKER_03]: That sounds like a good addition.

1346
01:49:49,803 --> 01:49:51,005
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's kind of neat because...

1347
01:49:51,741 --> 01:50:13,669
[SPEAKER_03]: When you hear all this news about, you know, In the Groove, and Neon FM, and what is that other one, Dance Tracks, or whatever, and all these kind of DDR knockoffs that are spawning from the Sim scene, and you know what, I realize In the Groove is getting a lot of credit now, but let's face it, it started as a Sim scene knockoff game, because it is Step Mania, basically, in a box.

1348
01:50:15,249 --> 01:50:17,230
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very interesting to see that Foon Mix...

1349
01:50:18,671 --> 01:50:23,134
[SPEAKER_03]: Which I believe to be the king of all this stuff is not an arcade thing.

1350
01:50:23,354 --> 01:50:24,055
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interesting.

1351
01:50:24,915 --> 01:50:38,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if it were ever to make it to the arcade scene, if they actually were to do something similar to what they're doing here within the groove over in Japan with Food Mix, I think it would wipe the floor within the groove.

1352
01:50:38,985 --> 01:50:40,927
[SPEAKER_02]: It would simply just topple it.

1353
01:50:41,087 --> 01:50:44,289
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just better songs, better everything.

1354
01:50:44,389 --> 01:50:45,170
[SPEAKER_02]: Better graphics.

1355
01:50:46,368 --> 01:50:51,993
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so much, so better, you know, done than In The Groove, it's not even funny.

1356
01:50:52,393 --> 01:50:53,954
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you can't even compare them.

1357
01:50:55,115 --> 01:50:56,356
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, check it out.

1358
01:50:56,716 --> 01:51:02,861
[SPEAKER_02]: If you haven't already downloaded FoonMix 1 and FoonMix Plus, I think you can still do that.

1359
01:51:03,842 --> 01:51:12,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely download those, it's a huge download, so if you're on dial-up, probably not going to be able to play that, but if you're not, check it out if you haven't already.

1360
01:51:13,959 --> 01:51:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I think in our next break, maybe if we can round up some songs, we'll do some Foon Mix music and maybe some other stuff, too.

1361
01:51:20,083 --> 01:51:24,825
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually... We haven't played any In the Groove songs in a while, so I think there's actually a couple songs that are worth playing.

1362
01:51:24,905 --> 01:51:27,387
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, Jamie's frowning of disapproval.

1363
01:51:28,187 --> 01:51:29,788
[SPEAKER_19]: My poor ears.

1364
01:51:30,148 --> 01:51:30,389
[SPEAKER_03]: I know.

1365
01:51:31,509 --> 01:51:34,111
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some songs I like in In the Groove, so I'm going to play one of those.

1366
01:51:34,791 --> 01:51:35,111
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1367
01:51:36,992 --> 01:51:39,054
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear about the winner of tonight's cage match, shall we?

1368
01:51:39,994 --> 01:51:40,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1369
01:51:40,755 --> 01:51:41,435
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?

1370
01:51:41,715 --> 01:51:42,355
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so...

1371
01:51:44,459 --> 01:51:47,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys voted, and there was a pretty clear winner tonight.

1372
01:51:47,700 --> 01:51:49,640
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to say, I was kind of surprised by it.

1373
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:54,101
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a brand new winner tonight, and it's Hadaway.

1374
01:51:55,981 --> 01:51:56,661
[SPEAKER_03]: What is love?

1375
01:51:56,961 --> 01:51:57,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Reloaded.

1376
01:51:57,501 --> 01:52:00,202
[SPEAKER_19]: The chatroom has no taste.

1377
01:52:00,322 --> 01:52:00,622
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

1378
01:52:00,702 --> 01:52:06,703
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they're just nostalgia whores, kind of like I am, because I think when that song started playing, a lot of them were like, I remember this song, I remember that.

1379
01:52:07,043 --> 01:52:10,964
[SPEAKER_19]: I remember the scene from... Was it Night of the Roxbury?

1380
01:52:10,984 --> 01:52:11,884
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Night of the Roxbury.

1381
01:52:11,944 --> 01:52:12,104
[SPEAKER_03]: I think...

1382
01:52:14,444 --> 01:52:22,946
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I think that, you know, that song, you heard it a lot, apparently, and that song was pretty damn horrid when that movie was out, but it's been a while, I think most people have forgotten it.

1383
01:52:22,966 --> 01:52:32,007
[SPEAKER_19]: There's a station in Mobile, I'll go ahead and name it, it's W-A-B-B, who, when that song came out, it literally played once every 30 minutes.

1384
01:52:33,188 --> 01:52:33,808
[SPEAKER_19]: I kid you not.

1385
01:52:33,828 --> 01:52:38,248
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I would totally listen to a station that played that kind of stuff, that's awesome.

1386
01:52:38,288 --> 01:52:40,889
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, they've also played a bunch of crap, because...

1387
01:52:41,607 --> 01:52:42,287
[SPEAKER_19]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1388
01:53:06,796 --> 01:53:06,976
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

1389
01:53:07,956 --> 01:53:08,116
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

1390
01:53:10,317 --> 01:53:10,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, stop.

1391
01:53:11,837 --> 01:53:12,177
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1392
01:53:14,618 --> 01:53:15,138
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1393
01:53:15,578 --> 01:53:16,178
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got that.

1394
01:53:16,318 --> 01:53:17,638
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what else I wanted to say.

1395
01:53:17,678 --> 01:53:21,899
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to kind of give a shout-out to one of our buddies.

1396
01:53:22,739 --> 01:53:25,720
[SPEAKER_03]: You know her as Rice Princess from Thursday Nights Outside the Box.

1397
01:53:26,020 --> 01:53:27,680
[SPEAKER_03]: She goes by a ton of other names, though.

1398
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,481
[SPEAKER_03]: Mojiko, Irene.

1399
01:53:30,661 --> 01:53:34,882
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a woman of many different names out there, but I'm sure you guys are familiar with her.

1400
01:53:36,371 --> 01:53:44,175
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't usually talk about big commercial gaming sites, but there's one in particular that I've grown quite fond of lately, and that's 1up.com.

1401
01:53:44,195 --> 01:53:45,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually really like them quite a bit.

1402
01:53:45,655 --> 01:53:46,336
[SPEAKER_03]: I would endorse them.

1403
01:53:46,356 --> 01:53:47,076
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a great site.

1404
01:53:47,456 --> 01:53:49,217
[SPEAKER_03]: We even have our own club over there.

1405
01:53:50,298 --> 01:53:52,619
[SPEAKER_03]: I will post the URL to that club in a little bit.

1406
01:53:52,659 --> 01:53:57,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's what, like orangeloungeradioclub or something like that, .1up.com.

1407
01:53:57,481 --> 01:53:58,341
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's a dash in there.

1408
01:53:58,361 --> 01:53:59,062
[SPEAKER_03]: Here, I got the link.

1409
01:53:59,102 --> 01:54:03,324
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just post that for you guys in the chat room if you want to join the orangeloungeradioclub.1up.com.

1410
01:54:05,111 --> 01:54:05,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to Rice Princess.

1411
01:54:06,032 --> 01:54:12,255
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only did she start that club on our behalf over there, but she was actually named Blog of the Day.

1412
01:54:12,896 --> 01:54:24,602
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know if that was today or yesterday, but her 1up.com blog was named Blog of the Day because she made this really big post about the Dear Friends concert that she went to Monday night in San Francisco, and somebody noticed and shared a little love.

1413
01:54:24,622 --> 01:54:28,264
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just want to say congratulations to our buddy Rice Princess on being to Blog of the Day.

1414
01:54:28,865 --> 01:54:29,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know me?

1415
01:54:29,705 --> 01:54:30,566
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so famous.

1416
01:54:33,948 --> 01:54:34,268
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1417
01:54:37,608 --> 01:54:39,290
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, I guess on that note, we're going to go.

1418
01:54:39,370 --> 01:54:40,391
[SPEAKER_03]: So we got the cage match winner.

1419
01:54:40,431 --> 01:54:40,811
[SPEAKER_03]: We got that.

1420
01:54:40,871 --> 01:54:41,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

1421
01:54:41,171 --> 01:54:42,332
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess we're going to go to a break.

1422
01:54:42,352 --> 01:54:45,575
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we come back from this break, we'll finally get to that list list we talked about.

1423
01:54:45,655 --> 01:54:47,276
[SPEAKER_03]: And the FUs of the week, we still got that as well.

1424
01:54:47,576 --> 01:54:48,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Some Ask Orange Lounge if we have time.

1425
01:54:49,397 --> 01:54:52,280
[SPEAKER_03]: In this break, some Food Mix and whatever else I can dig up.

1426
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:53,160
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

1427
01:54:53,481 --> 01:54:55,662
[SPEAKER_03]: Started off with a little bit of Evergreen from Food Mix.

1428
01:54:55,682 --> 01:54:56,363
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be back after this.

1429
01:55:02,007 --> 01:55:02,487
Evergreen.

1430
01:55:25,600 --> 01:55:30,563
[SPEAKER_09]: Feel the touch of my hands He's the group operator Hypnotized by the look in your eyes Hit the coast

1431
01:56:25,174 --> 01:56:25,735
[SPEAKER_11]: Feel you.

1432
01:57:59,344 --> 01:58:00,165
Thanks for watching!

1433
01:59:27,478 --> 01:59:27,939
Thank you.

1434
02:00:05,847 --> 02:00:06,087
Thank you.

1435
02:03:07,455 --> 02:03:16,078
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

1436
02:03:16,118 --> 02:03:21,661
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1437
02:03:23,615 --> 02:03:25,857
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1438
02:03:25,897 --> 02:03:30,301
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you enjoyed that set of mix there from some various sim file scene.

1439
02:03:30,901 --> 02:03:33,964
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how to kind of loop all that together, but what can you do?

1440
02:03:35,585 --> 02:03:37,687
[SPEAKER_03]: Beat Drop, or not Beat Drop, what the hell?

1441
02:03:38,047 --> 02:03:39,889
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the song from the Cage Match.

1442
02:03:39,969 --> 02:03:47,795
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting us off was Evergreen from Food Mix, then Zodiac from In the Groove, Mirrorball, and P8107 after that, both from Food Mix as well.

1443
02:03:48,776 --> 02:03:48,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1444
02:03:50,357 --> 02:03:55,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki is obsessed with this new show called Robot Chicken, which I actually watched last Sunday.

1445
02:03:55,684 --> 02:03:58,547
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I've been watching it every week because I think it's pretty damn funny too.

1446
02:03:59,128 --> 02:04:03,453
[SPEAKER_03]: But last Sunday was especially funny because they made fun of Mario Kart.

1447
02:04:03,974 --> 02:04:07,037
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not really made fun, but they totally paid homage to Mario Kart.

1448
02:04:07,078 --> 02:04:07,878
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll let Loki explain it.

1449
02:04:07,898 --> 02:04:08,299
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.

1450
02:04:09,096 --> 02:04:19,751
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, basically Robot Chicken, for those who don't know, it's this 15 minute long show that's on Cartoon Network, Sundays at 11.30, and I think they also have it repeating throughout the entire week.

1451
02:04:20,993 --> 02:04:21,874
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it repeats at

1452
02:04:22,335 --> 02:04:31,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know if anyone's going to be awake, but Monday at 2.30 a.m., Fridays at midnight and 3 a.m.

1453
02:04:32,563 --> 02:04:33,864
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can check them out then.

1454
02:04:34,825 --> 02:04:42,251
[SPEAKER_02]: Their last night's, basically, anyway, so 15-minute show, it's all stop animation with toys and claymation.

1455
02:04:42,812 --> 02:04:43,772
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.

1456
02:04:44,133 --> 02:04:47,675
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, week one, we had...

1457
02:04:48,846 --> 02:04:59,468
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a parody of, like, the, what was it, the Rachel Lee Cooks public service announcement, you know, where this is your brain on drugs, you know, but it doesn't stop there, you know, this is your family.

1458
02:04:59,788 --> 02:05:02,808
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's hitting stuff with, you know, a frying pan, and it's hilarious.

1459
02:05:03,509 --> 02:05:09,910
[SPEAKER_03]: I just need to say right now, although it is 1130 right now on the East Coast, that doesn't give you permission to stop listening to us and go watch this.

1460
02:05:10,270 --> 02:05:15,411
[SPEAKER_03]: You can download it on BitTorrent later, and also they replay it a ton, so get that.

1461
02:05:15,451 --> 02:05:17,451
[SPEAKER_03]: But for you West Coast folks, you'll be able to listen to it.

1462
02:05:18,570 --> 02:05:21,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Octimus Prime, Prostate Cancer Awareness

1463
02:05:31,907 --> 02:05:36,490
[SPEAKER_02]: And then last week, they did a parody of Cannonball Run.

1464
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:49,478
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who don't remember, Cannonball Run was the Burt Reynolds movie based on the actual cannonball races where you race across the country and it's like a no-holds-barred thing and they have all the weird teams of people and stuff.

1465
02:05:49,798 --> 02:05:53,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have all these icons from the 80s and stuff.

1466
02:05:53,961 --> 02:05:57,143
[SPEAKER_02]: They had Vin Diesel, supposedly, as a character.

1467
02:05:57,898 --> 02:06:08,222
[SPEAKER_02]: They had the Ecto-1, Speed Racer, Batman and Robin, the guys from Chips, and just a bunch of other weird people.

1468
02:06:08,382 --> 02:06:11,804
[SPEAKER_02]: And Mario, and Luigi, and Wario from Mario Kart.

1469
02:06:12,104 --> 02:06:15,225
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one scene in there where they're actually in the race, and they're all...

1470
02:06:16,168 --> 02:06:18,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's time we use the blue tortoiseshell!

1471
02:06:19,229 --> 02:06:24,510
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they use the blue tortoiseshell and it hits the guys from... What is it?

1472
02:06:26,090 --> 02:06:29,031
[SPEAKER_02]: It just knocks one of the cars off the road and it was hilarious.

1473
02:06:29,231 --> 02:06:31,031
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I cannot describe it well enough.

1474
02:06:31,211 --> 02:06:36,672
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to go watch the show tonight to give you a brief preview of what's going to be on.

1475
02:06:37,652 --> 02:06:39,313
[SPEAKER_02]: This episode is called The Deep End.

1476
02:06:39,353 --> 02:06:44,854
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, find out what happens when seven superheroes are forced to live under one roof in the real world metropolis...

1477
02:06:46,755 --> 02:06:47,175
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

1478
02:06:47,996 --> 02:06:49,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Wasn't this called Drawn Together?

1479
02:06:50,937 --> 02:06:52,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, yes, maybe, but this will be better.

1480
02:06:56,239 --> 02:06:58,860
[SPEAKER_02]: And then catch Adam James...

1481
02:07:00,243 --> 02:07:17,869
[SPEAKER_02]: James T. Kirk, Khan, Noonien Sing, and Kirk Cameron work in a pizza joint in two Kirks, a Khan, and a pizza place.

1482
02:07:19,710 --> 02:07:24,111
[SPEAKER_02]: And someone's on a mission to track down Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny in Kill Bunny.

1483
02:07:25,171 --> 02:07:29,553
[SPEAKER_02]: And lastly, go backstage for America's favorite undead reality show, Zombie Idol.

1484
02:07:30,885 --> 02:07:36,027
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's great about this show is they actually have a lot of the celebrities doing their own voices and stuff.

1485
02:07:36,708 --> 02:07:37,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of work.

1486
02:07:37,848 --> 02:07:41,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, for example, last week, Luigi, voiced by Matthew Lillard.

1487
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:43,951
[SPEAKER_02]: Great stuff.

1488
02:07:44,571 --> 02:07:44,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.

1489
02:07:45,051 --> 02:07:46,872
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, watch the show.

1490
02:07:47,412 --> 02:07:49,753
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can't watch it, it's on torrentbox.com.

1491
02:07:51,514 --> 02:07:54,455
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, we have some folks in the chatroom saying, I'm T-voing it right now.

1492
02:07:55,470 --> 02:07:58,172
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm looking at our live listener stats to us.

1493
02:07:58,192 --> 02:07:58,833
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going on.

1494
02:07:58,893 --> 02:08:01,615
[SPEAKER_03]: I noticed four people dropped while we were talking about Robot Chicken.

1495
02:08:01,975 --> 02:08:02,976
[SPEAKER_03]: So damn you!

1496
02:08:03,136 --> 02:08:05,098
[SPEAKER_03]: I told you not to leave to go watch it.

1497
02:08:05,378 --> 02:08:05,878
[SPEAKER_03]: Damn you.

1498
02:08:07,359 --> 02:08:08,080
[SPEAKER_03]: Stop being cheap.

1499
02:08:08,120 --> 02:08:08,760
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy a TiVo.

1500
02:08:09,161 --> 02:08:11,763
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if this show gets weak in its last hour.

1501
02:08:13,164 --> 02:08:13,544
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1502
02:08:15,205 --> 02:08:22,171
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of that weak program you've come to know and love here at Orange Launch Radio, it's time to do tonight's listless segment.

1503
02:08:22,271 --> 02:08:23,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay!

1504
02:08:23,852 --> 02:08:25,013
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know we need some theme music.

1505
02:08:31,469 --> 02:09:01,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, tonight's list list everybody is going to be, the topic is Slash commands I would like to see in an MMORPG And of course this topic being spawned by the recent news about Slash Pizza being added into Pizza Hut I'm sorry, being added The newest MMORPG, Pizza Hut, where you play as the delivery person

1506
02:09:02,233 --> 02:09:09,576
[SPEAKER_19]: You have to avoid obstacles such as dogs chasing you and throwing newspapers, I mean pizzas into, oh wait, that's Paperboy.

1507
02:09:10,476 --> 02:09:11,596
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, smartass.

1508
02:09:12,477 --> 02:09:13,497
[SPEAKER_19]: Don't you know it?

1509
02:09:13,757 --> 02:09:16,418
[SPEAKER_19]: My ass is this smart, imagine how smart my brain is.

1510
02:09:16,906 --> 02:09:25,634
[SPEAKER_03]: slash pizza being added into EverQuest 2 in a partnership with Pizza Hut so you can order pizza directly from your EverQuest 2 game.

1511
02:09:25,974 --> 02:09:29,257
[SPEAKER_03]: So what other slash commands would we like to see in an MMORPG?

1512
02:09:29,797 --> 02:09:32,660
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys in the chatroom can submit your suggestions, of course.

1513
02:09:32,720 --> 02:09:33,460
[SPEAKER_03]: Just type them up.

1514
02:09:33,881 --> 02:09:35,842
[SPEAKER_03]: No guarantees we're going to use them, though, but we'll see.

1515
02:09:36,563 --> 02:09:40,827
[SPEAKER_03]: We do have the chatroom displayed on our in-studio television screen where everybody can see it.

1516
02:09:41,367 --> 02:09:48,315
[SPEAKER_03]: Tonight on Listless, participating, we have DarkSakura, Loki, myself, and Angel and Explicit are working as one team tonight.

1517
02:09:48,395 --> 02:09:49,136
[SPEAKER_03]: They're one mind.

1518
02:09:49,716 --> 02:09:50,918
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, not anymore?

1519
02:09:51,558 --> 02:09:51,699
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

1520
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,281
[SPEAKER_03]: They are two separate entities now.

1521
02:09:54,342 --> 02:09:58,206
[SPEAKER_03]: They have, uh, they have, I know, that's very, that does sound kind of wrong.

1522
02:09:58,526 --> 02:09:58,846
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1523
02:09:59,327 --> 02:10:00,108
[SPEAKER_03]: But really funny.

1524
02:10:01,670 --> 02:10:02,030
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1525
02:10:03,737 --> 02:10:04,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's find this.

1526
02:10:04,238 --> 02:10:05,580
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, I'm going to kill the background music.

1527
02:10:05,600 --> 02:10:06,401
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll bring it back later.

1528
02:10:06,481 --> 02:10:08,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, you guys get to vote.

1529
02:10:08,484 --> 02:10:10,166
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys get to vote on the top three.

1530
02:10:10,226 --> 02:10:11,568
[SPEAKER_03]: We're only creating the list.

1531
02:10:11,888 --> 02:10:15,173
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's going to happen is we're each going to read off our top three.

1532
02:10:15,733 --> 02:10:16,795
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the fun part.

1533
02:10:17,275 --> 02:10:20,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Each one of us gets to take one off of the list.

1534
02:10:21,274 --> 02:10:26,257
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your number three pick for a slash command you'd like to see in an MMORPG?

1535
02:10:51,081 --> 02:10:52,623
[SPEAKER_19]: My first one is slash window.

1536
02:10:53,583 --> 02:10:54,905
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does slash window do?

1537
02:10:55,285 --> 02:11:08,918
[SPEAKER_19]: It opens up like a little PIP window where you can like, you know, like if you instead of, because, you know, obviously they're not going to actually window Final Fantasy XI without using something that they consider illegal.

1538
02:11:10,199 --> 02:11:15,604
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you should be able to access like the play online site as a window in window.

1539
02:11:16,005 --> 02:11:16,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait a minute.

1540
02:11:17,304 --> 02:11:20,266
[SPEAKER_03]: You've actually come up with a practical, good idea.

1541
02:11:20,766 --> 02:11:21,506
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not funny.

1542
02:11:22,327 --> 02:11:23,087
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just kidding.

1543
02:11:23,107 --> 02:11:23,908
[SPEAKER_03]: My other ones are funny.

1544
02:11:23,988 --> 02:11:24,828
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be funny.

1545
02:11:24,848 --> 02:11:30,031
[SPEAKER_19]: But I was really annoyed, because usually I have to set up my laptop to use a fake use-to-play.

1546
02:11:31,892 --> 02:11:33,573
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just loving our chatroom right now.

1547
02:11:33,813 --> 02:11:36,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys, seriously, if you haven't looked at what the chatroom is... Slash all your base.

1548
02:11:37,135 --> 02:11:39,036
[SPEAKER_03]: I like slash girls' butts.

1549
02:11:40,656 --> 02:11:41,797
[SPEAKER_19]: Sega Dreamcast.

1550
02:11:42,097 --> 02:11:42,377
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1551
02:11:42,718 --> 02:11:43,258
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they need to...

1552
02:11:44,412 --> 02:11:50,496
[SPEAKER_19]: Even though I would put, I would have, this would have been like my number four, would have been like slash PSO mode.

1553
02:11:50,876 --> 02:11:51,156
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh-huh.

1554
02:11:51,876 --> 02:11:53,858
[SPEAKER_19]: Where you just walk, run around from room to room.

1555
02:11:53,878 --> 02:11:55,218
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1556
02:11:55,719 --> 02:11:56,219
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1557
02:11:56,599 --> 02:11:57,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go on.

1558
02:11:57,239 --> 02:11:58,680
[SPEAKER_03]: Explicit, your number three, please.

1559
02:11:58,700 --> 02:12:01,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash yo mama.

1560
02:12:01,462 --> 02:12:01,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, wait.

1561
02:12:01,842 --> 02:12:03,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a microphone over there, buddy?

1562
02:12:03,343 --> 02:12:03,923
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

1563
02:12:03,983 --> 02:12:04,664
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, listeners in here.

1564
02:12:04,684 --> 02:12:05,424
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1565
02:12:06,645 --> 02:12:07,465
[SPEAKER_05]: Slash yo mama.

1566
02:12:07,846 --> 02:12:08,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash yo mama.

1567
02:12:08,946 --> 02:12:10,207
[SPEAKER_03]: And what does slash yo mama do?

1568
02:12:11,274 --> 02:12:13,835
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're all saying, ooh, I fucked your mom and stuff.

1569
02:12:14,295 --> 02:12:16,656
[SPEAKER_03]: So slash yo mama would actually fuck your mama?

1570
02:12:17,597 --> 02:12:17,837
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1571
02:12:20,818 --> 02:12:21,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Ouch.

1572
02:12:21,278 --> 02:12:22,279
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel sorry for yo mama.

1573
02:12:23,039 --> 02:12:23,819
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, you're number three.

1574
02:12:28,902 --> 02:12:30,042
[SPEAKER_17]: Slash silly string.

1575
02:12:31,183 --> 02:12:32,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash silly string.

1576
02:12:32,363 --> 02:12:33,964
[SPEAKER_03]: And what would slash silly string do?

1577
02:12:35,224 --> 02:12:40,867
[SPEAKER_17]: Enable you with the silly string, kid, so you could, like, have a silly string fight with the rest of your party.

1578
02:12:42,592 --> 02:12:44,013
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my, let's get messy!

1579
02:12:44,433 --> 02:12:46,073
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Loki, you're number three.

1580
02:12:51,456 --> 02:12:53,617
[SPEAKER_02]: Slash Nicole Brown Simpson.

1581
02:12:58,359 --> 02:13:01,620
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we know.

1582
02:13:02,160 --> 02:13:05,101
[SPEAKER_02]: This would, yeah.

1583
02:13:06,922 --> 02:13:10,924
[SPEAKER_02]: This would link you to the Find the Real Killers website out there.

1584
02:13:12,577 --> 02:13:19,525
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they're out there and loose and OG Simpson is searching for them in every golf course.

1585
02:13:22,008 --> 02:13:22,288
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

1586
02:13:23,269 --> 02:13:24,171
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, wow, wow.

1587
02:13:25,432 --> 02:13:27,835
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three needs a little bit of explaining.

1588
02:13:27,935 --> 02:13:31,259
[SPEAKER_03]: My number three choice is Slash Abshock.

1589
02:13:32,403 --> 02:13:33,504
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1590
02:13:55,290 --> 02:13:55,750
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.

1591
02:13:55,950 --> 02:13:56,590
[SPEAKER_03]: No, not really.

1592
02:13:56,750 --> 02:13:59,391
[SPEAKER_19]: No, they're anorexic from having the lack of slash pizza.

1593
02:14:00,531 --> 02:14:00,891
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1594
02:14:02,072 --> 02:14:02,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.

1595
02:14:02,772 --> 02:14:04,032
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, you're number two.

1596
02:14:05,793 --> 02:14:06,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Let me pull up the file again.

1597
02:14:08,614 --> 02:14:09,454
[SPEAKER_19]: I love my laptop.

1598
02:14:11,054 --> 02:14:11,774
[SPEAKER_19]: Slash sim.

1599
02:14:13,335 --> 02:14:16,656
[SPEAKER_19]: What that does is it creates a simulacrum of yourself to go to your job.

1600
02:14:19,156 --> 02:14:20,637
[SPEAKER_19]: Like the Calvin clone machine.

1601
02:14:21,177 --> 02:14:21,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1602
02:14:22,367 --> 02:14:23,387
[SPEAKER_03]: Someday, I hope.

1603
02:14:23,508 --> 02:14:24,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, very nice.

1604
02:14:25,208 --> 02:14:25,808
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash Sim.

1605
02:14:26,769 --> 02:14:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Explicit.

1606
02:14:29,730 --> 02:14:30,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash pubic hairs.

1607
02:14:35,192 --> 02:14:38,333
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this for all the 12 and 13 year olds that play MMOs or what?

1608
02:14:38,854 --> 02:14:39,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody?

1609
02:14:39,834 --> 02:14:45,916
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope that one day... What in the hell is this slash command supposed to do?

1610
02:14:48,638 --> 02:14:49,118
What the...

1611
02:14:52,379 --> 02:14:53,080
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, alright.

1612
02:14:53,480 --> 02:15:02,625
[SPEAKER_05]: What this code does is, well, you know how people fantasize about... It's basically a nude code without the pubic hair.

1613
02:15:03,526 --> 02:15:04,507
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, okay.

1614
02:15:04,827 --> 02:15:07,288
[SPEAKER_19]: Or if a boy wants to... I don't fantasize about that kind of thing.

1615
02:15:07,689 --> 02:15:08,209
[SPEAKER_03]: But some do.

1616
02:15:09,270 --> 02:15:14,313
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of which, how did your 40 days without a boner thing go, speaking of which?

1617
02:15:15,513 --> 02:15:16,854
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, by the way, I'm surviving.

1618
02:15:16,874 --> 02:15:18,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a few more days.

1619
02:15:18,855 --> 02:15:19,216
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.

1620
02:15:19,256 --> 02:15:21,117
[SPEAKER_05]: Meaning I've not got a morning boner...

1621
02:15:21,938 --> 02:15:25,842
[SPEAKER_05]: or I see any attractive tits or porno or strip club.

1622
02:15:26,122 --> 02:15:27,423
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll never get a boner again.

1623
02:15:28,624 --> 02:15:29,044
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, God.

1624
02:15:29,425 --> 02:15:30,426
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

1625
02:15:30,766 --> 02:15:32,367
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, I'll explain that later.

1626
02:15:32,487 --> 02:15:34,149
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, your number two pick.

1627
02:15:37,252 --> 02:15:38,192
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, you need a mic, don't you?

1628
02:15:39,954 --> 02:15:40,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch slap.

1629
02:15:42,977 --> 02:15:46,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, would slash bitch slap bitch slap you or the other player?

1630
02:15:47,682 --> 02:15:53,528
[SPEAKER_17]: Right, um, like, let's say you have somebody in your party that you don't like or isn't doing their job yet, right?

1631
02:15:53,588 --> 02:15:55,230
[SPEAKER_17]: Just do slash bitch slap.

1632
02:15:56,311 --> 02:15:56,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1633
02:15:57,011 --> 02:15:59,294
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, Loki, you're number two.

1634
02:16:01,436 --> 02:16:08,563
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only appropriate thing that we're actually missing from an MMORPG is slash dingo because, you know,

1635
02:16:10,063 --> 02:16:14,745
[SPEAKER_02]: When someone really pisses you off online, you really wish a dingo would go eat their baby.

1636
02:16:15,306 --> 02:16:19,688
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you can have that thanks to our brand new dingo technology.

1637
02:16:20,308 --> 02:16:22,649
[SPEAKER_02]: Dingoes can and will eat your babies.

1638
02:16:24,310 --> 02:16:26,031
[SPEAKER_11]: A dingo ate my baby!

1639
02:16:28,832 --> 02:16:32,294
[SPEAKER_03]: My number two pick is slash Fred Durst porn video.

1640
02:16:33,852 --> 02:16:46,696
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for this is because when you guys are feeling a little bit inadequate because you're staying in the house all day and playing MMORPGs, you can type slash Fred Durst porn video and you can see that you can have it off a lot worse and you'll feel better about yourself.

1641
02:16:48,617 --> 02:16:50,198
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so slash Fred Durst porn video.

1642
02:16:52,939 --> 02:16:54,099
[SPEAKER_03]: I typed slash Fred.

1643
02:16:54,199 --> 02:16:56,540
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Jamie, you're number one.

1644
02:16:56,700 --> 02:16:59,161
[SPEAKER_19]: My number one is slash IDBFG.

1645
02:17:01,542 --> 02:17:02,422
[SPEAKER_19]: Anyone ever play Doom?

1646
02:17:04,272 --> 02:17:07,954
[SPEAKER_19]: Imagine going around Final Fantasy XI with the BFG.

1647
02:17:13,138 --> 02:17:13,498
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1648
02:17:14,038 --> 02:17:18,141
[SPEAKER_19]: Imagine gunning down anything that gets in your way with extreme prejudice.

1649
02:17:20,162 --> 02:17:20,623
[SPEAKER_21]: Very nice.

1650
02:17:21,083 --> 02:17:24,605
[SPEAKER_19]: I could just imagine right now, Battering Ram, fuck you!

1651
02:17:25,106 --> 02:17:25,506
[SPEAKER_19]: Button.

1652
02:17:27,007 --> 02:17:28,208
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, sounds good.

1653
02:17:28,248 --> 02:17:31,030
[SPEAKER_03]: So ID BFG, just like the Doom Days.

1654
02:17:31,430 --> 02:17:33,151
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Explicit, you're number one.

1655
02:17:35,496 --> 02:17:39,258
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash Tack Slash Engulf

1656
02:18:05,541 --> 02:18:06,282
[SPEAKER_17]: Ah, that made you giggle.

1657
02:18:06,642 --> 02:18:07,903
[SPEAKER_03]: And what pray tell does that do?

1658
02:18:08,003 --> 02:18:09,624
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it engulf your opponent in flames?

1659
02:18:10,625 --> 02:18:13,967
[SPEAKER_17]: Either your opponent or somebody in your party you don't like.

1660
02:18:15,088 --> 02:18:16,909
[SPEAKER_03]: So engulf is the number one.

1661
02:18:16,970 --> 02:18:17,330
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1662
02:18:18,411 --> 02:18:19,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, you're number one.

1663
02:18:22,273 --> 02:18:24,515
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured this is the most needed thing in the world.

1664
02:18:25,136 --> 02:18:26,456
[SPEAKER_02]: Slash real girl.

1665
02:18:28,198 --> 02:18:31,100
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some of those people, they need to realize...

1666
02:18:31,721 --> 02:18:35,602
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to find a real girl and not masturbate to fictional women.

1667
02:18:36,663 --> 02:18:38,023
[SPEAKER_02]: So slash real girl.

1668
02:18:39,004 --> 02:18:40,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, that's what's needed.

1669
02:18:42,545 --> 02:18:46,747
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, and my number one is slash give me a dollar.

1670
02:18:49,548 --> 02:18:50,228
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, very cool.

1671
02:18:52,504 --> 02:18:54,805
[SPEAKER_03]: and when you type it, it would give you a dollar.

1672
02:18:55,145 --> 02:18:56,045
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't overuse it.

1673
02:18:56,125 --> 02:18:56,425
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1674
02:18:56,926 --> 02:18:57,726
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is.

1675
02:18:57,846 --> 02:18:59,827
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is the list as it stands currently.

1676
02:18:59,927 --> 02:19:18,953
[SPEAKER_03]: Slash window, slash yo mama, slash silly string, slash Nicole Brown Simpson, slash ab shocks, slash sim, slash pubic hairs, slash bitch slap, slash dingo, slash Fred Durst porn video, slash IDBFG, slash taku, slash engulf, slash real girl, slash give me a dollar.

1677
02:19:20,414 --> 02:19:20,494
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh...

1678
02:19:21,050 --> 02:19:28,255
[SPEAKER_03]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1679
02:19:51,960 --> 02:19:55,642
[SPEAKER_03]: It does kind of sound like The Sims, although I guess that's kind of the idea behind it.

1680
02:19:55,662 --> 02:19:59,644
[SPEAKER_03]: But we wouldn't want people to get confused, because Americans do get a little too easily confused.

1681
02:20:00,064 --> 02:20:01,685
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, Angel, one of these has got to go.

1682
02:20:02,186 --> 02:20:02,946
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to kill me.

1683
02:20:03,906 --> 02:20:04,407
[SPEAKER_17]: Porn video.

1684
02:20:05,687 --> 02:20:07,028
[SPEAKER_17]: That was the best one on there.

1685
02:20:08,149 --> 02:20:09,349
[SPEAKER_03]: She always takes off the best one.

1686
02:20:09,389 --> 02:20:12,611
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, slash Fred Durst porn video is gone.

1687
02:20:13,312 --> 02:20:13,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks to Angel.

1688
02:20:14,812 --> 02:20:19,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to eliminate slash pubic hairs, because I didn't really get it.

1689
02:20:19,915 --> 02:20:21,376
[SPEAKER_03]: So, sorry, explicit.

1690
02:20:22,051 --> 02:20:24,912
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, Loki, you're going to pick the last one that's come off this list.

1691
02:20:28,653 --> 02:20:34,395
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have to say Slash Window because it's just not funny.

1692
02:20:35,275 --> 02:20:36,375
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need funny.

1693
02:20:37,936 --> 02:20:41,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Heaven forbid someone come up with a good idea during List List.

1694
02:20:41,557 --> 02:20:43,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Heaven forbid, we can't have that.

1695
02:20:44,218 --> 02:20:47,339
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to come up with Slash Poop, but, you know...

1696
02:20:52,995 --> 02:20:54,016
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, here it is.

1697
02:20:54,916 --> 02:20:57,618
[SPEAKER_03]: The list that you guys will get to vote for, alright?

1698
02:20:58,399 --> 02:21:02,182
[SPEAKER_03]: So, pick your favorite from that list and send me a private message with your vote.

1699
02:21:02,202 --> 02:21:03,803
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Dark Knight gets a cookie.

1700
02:21:03,863 --> 02:21:04,183
[SPEAKER_03]: All army.

1701
02:21:22,470 --> 02:21:26,713
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about some of the... Wow, a lot of you guys are participating in this.

1702
02:21:26,773 --> 02:21:30,216

1703
02:21:30,236 --> 02:21:33,158
[SPEAKER_03]: So here are some honorable mentions I'm reading in the chat room.

1704
02:21:34,819 --> 02:21:36,080

[SPEAKER_03]: Where was... There was one I really... Oh, Slash Jesus Juice.

1712
02:22:25,731 --> 02:22:27,232
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my favorite, I think.

1713
02:22:27,913 --> 02:22:30,414
[SPEAKER_03]: Out of the chatroom was Slash Jesus Juice.

1714
02:22:32,555 --> 02:22:34,917
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew that Zaku could say something funny?

1715
02:22:35,017 --> 02:22:35,417
[SPEAKER_03]: Who knew?

1716
02:22:35,797 --> 02:22:37,938
[SPEAKER_03]: But that was, I think, my favorite out of the chatroom.

1717
02:22:37,959 --> 02:22:39,840
[SPEAKER_03]: So just as one was Slash Jesus Juice.

1718
02:22:40,880 --> 02:22:42,741
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of good ones there in the chatroom, you guys.

1719
02:22:42,781 --> 02:22:43,202

1725
02:22:58,777 --> 02:23:03,298
[SPEAKER_03]: So in this break, Moonlight Shadow, because that song rocks, and we haven't heard it in a while.

1726
02:23:03,499 --> 02:23:04,979
[SPEAKER_03]: So here it is, and we'll be back after this.

1727

1736
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:39,010

02:28:13,874 --> 02:28:14,034
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey!

1756
02:28:14,054 --> 02:28:14,515
[SPEAKER_19]: Hey!

1757
02:28:15,934 --> 02:28:20,617
[SPEAKER_19]: I witnessed an accident nearly happen today because both drivers were on their damn cell phones.

1758
02:28:21,337 --> 02:28:21,897
[SPEAKER_19]: So fuck them.

1759
02:28:22,558 --> 02:28:23,058
[SPEAKER_19]: Sorry, Rob.

1760
02:28:23,298 --> 02:28:25,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I don't think other people should be on their cell phones, just me.

1761
02:28:25,860 --> 02:28:26,640
[SPEAKER_03]: So that wouldn't have happened.

1762
02:28:26,740 --> 02:28:26,940
[SPEAKER_19]: No.

1763
02:28:27,160 --> 02:28:34,064
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, you know the law's going to pass this year, so I'm looking forward to that.

1764
02:28:34,104 --> 02:28:41,468
[SPEAKER_19]: There's also... Shoot, I was thinking about this earlier today, and I completely forgot what it was.

1765
02:28:41,488 --> 02:28:44,390
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh, yeah.

1766
02:28:44,410 --> 02:28:44,630
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

1767
02:28:45,430 --> 02:28:46,171
[SPEAKER_19]: F you to people.

1768
02:28:47,812 --> 02:28:51,856
[SPEAKER_19]: And this is more of a situational F you.

1769
02:28:52,256 --> 02:28:58,501
[SPEAKER_19]: But when people complain about how much their life sucks, yet they don't do anything about it, fuck that.

1770
02:28:59,622 --> 02:29:05,847
[SPEAKER_19]: You don't have a right to complain until you are actively working to remedy your situation.

1771
02:29:06,928 --> 02:29:13,674
[SPEAKER_19]: You know, you can say, oh, well, I'm tired of being fat or something like that.

1772
02:29:14,059 --> 02:29:15,040
[SPEAKER_19]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1773
02:29:44,128 --> 02:30:10,944
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't understand that I also have a big SU to people who complain about not having money yet continue to frivolously spend on shit they don't need I've had to break myself of this habit too but I recognize that I don't have money because I spent it on this, this, this and this well now I can actively say

1774
02:30:11,417 --> 02:30:14,980
[SPEAKER_19]: I don't have the money to spend on it because I'm saving up to buy a house, which is true.

1775
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:16,261
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to be buying a house this year.

1776
02:30:17,642 --> 02:30:29,252
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... But it's also... It's just, again, I don't understand the whole mentality of how people can bitch about something yet not do anything to remedy it.

1777
02:30:29,733 --> 02:30:30,213
[SPEAKER_19]: You know what I mean?

1778
02:30:31,794 --> 02:30:35,878
[SPEAKER_19]: Um... I also big S you to, uh... Um...

1779
02:30:37,791 --> 02:31:07,405
[SPEAKER_19]: the car wash line at Chevron today there were seven people in the damn line and the line wasn't moving so I'm going to have to go back after the show at night and get my car washed where the water will not evaporate as quickly big F you're not having an air conditioner but hey, I'm going to have my air conditioning replaced next week I'm doing something about it that's been my big thing is people who just don't do anything to fix their situation so I'm done here

1780
02:31:09,008 --> 02:31:10,129
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki's turn!

1781
02:31:14,071 --> 02:31:21,575
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, first off, I'd like to say a big fuck you to, um, LRGs, because they've been kicking my ass all week.

1782
02:31:22,535 --> 02:31:35,602
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just now starting to feel a little bit better, um, but I don't think that's gonna last very long, because it's LRG season, and I'm affected by both mold and pollen, so I'm fucked all year round.

1783
02:31:36,574 --> 02:31:37,994
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much like I am at work.

1784
02:31:38,235 --> 02:31:38,475
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

1785
02:31:40,795 --> 02:31:42,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to work for being a little boring.

1786
02:31:43,256 --> 02:31:52,999
[SPEAKER_02]: I tried making a catapult out of my pen last week, and I got a little bit of ink on my finger, because I guess pens don't like to be turned into catapults.

1787
02:31:53,619 --> 02:31:54,599
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh well, so much for that.

1788
02:31:56,139 --> 02:32:05,062
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, also, fuck you the fact that I need, like, I have this urge for projects, even though I haven't finished other projects, and I really...

1789
02:32:06,085 --> 02:32:12,327
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard, it's like crack, I can't stop, I just gotta build crap, and I don't know why.

1790
02:32:13,027 --> 02:32:16,888
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't even use what I build, it's, I don't get it.

1791
02:32:17,528 --> 02:32:23,030
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, it's just some weird obsession that I have, so I just can't stop.

1792
02:32:23,730 --> 02:32:32,152
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, fuck you to Lindsay Lohan for acting, because you suck, and I don't really need you to, you know...

1793
02:32:32,722 --> 02:32:35,445
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does Disney have to fucking remake every movie that they've made?

1794
02:32:35,825 --> 02:32:37,447
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know what, all the remakes suck.

1795
02:32:38,048 --> 02:32:39,109
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fuck those.

1796
02:32:40,110 --> 02:32:42,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck, you know, the Son of the Mask, because that sucked.

1797
02:32:43,033 --> 02:32:46,657
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still being made, and I got the damn screener for it, and it's dirty.

1798
02:32:47,558 --> 02:32:52,443
[SPEAKER_02]: No, or actually, I didn't get the screener for it, but fuck, I got tickets to it, and I never went and saw it, so it was good.

1799
02:32:53,665 --> 02:32:53,725
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

1800
02:32:54,730 --> 02:33:02,995
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, fuck you, the family that's suing Michael Jackson, because I believe that they're just seeing him as an easy target to try to get money.

1801
02:33:03,896 --> 02:33:11,940
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you actually follow the testimony, there's a lot of discrepancies, let's put it that way, in their testimony.

1802
02:33:12,481 --> 02:33:14,482
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope they get sued.

1803
02:33:15,262 --> 02:33:26,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and another thing, I'm not sure if anyone heard about it, there was actually a news report a while back of this guy that sued, I believe it's ABC or whoever the fuck puts out that goddamn show, Fear Factor.

1804
02:33:26,771 --> 02:33:35,758
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically got sick and dizzy and fell into a door well from watching the show and so he was suing them.

1805
02:33:37,177 --> 02:33:46,102
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was justice being done, and the judge said, fuck you, this is a frivolous lawsuit, and threw it right back at him, and didn't award him any money.

1806
02:33:46,262 --> 02:33:48,603
[SPEAKER_02]: So, at least there's some justice in this world.

1807
02:33:49,884 --> 02:33:59,329
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'm done.

1808
02:33:59,549 --> 02:34:01,169
[SPEAKER_03]: An F you to E!

1809
02:34:01,210 --> 02:34:05,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Entertainment Television for having those really addicting Michael Jackson trial wrap-up shows.

1810
02:34:06,543 --> 02:34:09,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Would they actually reenact what's going on in the courtroom?

1811
02:34:09,365 --> 02:34:10,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that shit is hilarious.

1812
02:34:11,486 --> 02:34:16,310
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy that they have playing Michael Jackson is very eerie, like, identical.

1813
02:34:16,390 --> 02:34:16,890
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.

1814
02:34:17,811 --> 02:34:19,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Except they drew on his nose.

1815
02:34:19,692 --> 02:34:20,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not kidding you.

1816
02:34:20,473 --> 02:34:21,033
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.

1817
02:34:21,073 --> 02:34:22,934
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like his nose is drawn on.

1818
02:34:23,555 --> 02:34:24,535
[SPEAKER_03]: It's disgusting.

1819
02:34:24,996 --> 02:34:31,940
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to House Hunting, because it's a pain in the ass, and I've been kind of looking for, like, a new place where the new Orange Lounge studio will be.

1820
02:34:32,501 --> 02:34:32,561
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1821
02:34:33,341 --> 02:34:36,103
[SPEAKER_03]: And we found five places on the internet we liked.

1822
02:34:36,163 --> 02:34:39,405
[SPEAKER_03]: We drove by and only liked two of them when we drove by them.

1823
02:34:39,505 --> 02:34:42,146
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of them is in the ghetto, so it's kind of a question mark.

1824
02:34:42,526 --> 02:34:44,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Although it sucks because that was by far my favorite house.

1825
02:34:44,768 --> 02:34:47,089
[SPEAKER_03]: It was such a cute little house and it had a little gate and everything.

1826
02:34:47,369 --> 02:34:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I really want it and it's affordable.

1827
02:34:48,990 --> 02:34:49,810
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's in the ghetto.

1828
02:34:49,830 --> 02:34:51,891
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, but I kind of want it.

1829
02:34:52,312 --> 02:34:53,552
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I could get a guard dog.

1830
02:34:54,193 --> 02:34:57,615
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio, coming to you live from the ghetto.

1831
02:34:58,815 --> 02:34:59,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.

1832
02:35:00,296 --> 02:35:01,577
[SPEAKER_03]: We're coming to you from South Sac.

1833
02:35:03,746 --> 02:35:04,347
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's alright.

1834
02:35:05,147 --> 02:35:05,968
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll figure something out.

1835
02:35:06,468 --> 02:35:08,070
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll figure something out, I always do.

1836
02:35:09,111 --> 02:35:10,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But house hunting sucks, so F you to that.

1837
02:35:11,192 --> 02:35:13,354
[SPEAKER_03]: And F you to just moving in general, because moving sucks.

1838
02:35:15,216 --> 02:35:17,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Because can you imagine having to clean this apartment?

1839
02:35:17,798 --> 02:35:18,618
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to suck.

1840
02:35:19,399 --> 02:35:20,300
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be horrible.

1841
02:35:20,400 --> 02:35:21,961
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know what?

1842
02:35:21,981 --> 02:35:24,443
[SPEAKER_03]: The place I lived in Chico was worse.

1843
02:35:24,843 --> 02:35:27,386
[SPEAKER_03]: And I made it somehow, so I'll get through this.

1844
02:35:28,306 --> 02:35:31,269
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's get to our guest F yous.

1845
02:35:31,369 --> 02:35:32,530
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting it off with...

1846
02:35:33,567 --> 02:35:35,728
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, the marathon man himself, explicit.

1847
02:35:37,589 --> 02:35:38,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let's see.

1848
02:35:39,650 --> 02:35:45,913
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to give an Effie to work for letting me stay in the sun, for having me stay in the sun without getting me a break at work.

1849
02:35:47,013 --> 02:35:47,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Jesus.

1850
02:35:48,434 --> 02:35:57,758
[SPEAKER_05]: Yesterday was extremely hot and someone who was supposed to be giving breaks because I was working 10 o'clock in the morning until like 6 at night did not give me a break and everybody else got a break.

1851
02:35:59,042 --> 02:36:03,284
[SPEAKER_05]: Well guess what, almost got heat stroke and almost fainted.

1852
02:36:05,184 --> 02:36:10,926
[SPEAKER_05]: And AFP goes to a lot of depression towards this and pressure family wise.

1853
02:36:12,247 --> 02:36:15,548
[SPEAKER_05]: Of course some of you know that my dad passed away like two years ago.

1854
02:36:16,583 --> 02:36:17,063
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry to hear that.

1855
02:36:17,644 --> 02:36:23,867
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and it's been tough, but some people are pushing me to a point where they don't even understand what I'm going through.

1856
02:36:24,487 --> 02:36:25,848
[SPEAKER_05]: They think it's, oh, so what?

1857
02:36:27,389 --> 02:36:33,052
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, okay, a person died two years ago, and you're going to talk trash behind his back?

1858
02:36:34,933 --> 02:36:39,715
[SPEAKER_05]: That really hurts, especially when I caught somebody in the cemetery trying to steal flowers.

1859
02:36:40,976 --> 02:36:41,316
What?

1860
02:36:41,676 --> 02:36:41,976
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.

1861
02:36:42,517 --> 02:36:43,097
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.

1862
02:36:44,850 --> 02:36:48,471
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my woman, but this is the only way I can... Yeah.

1863
02:36:50,632 --> 02:36:53,792
[SPEAKER_03]: There's other ways to show your affection, other than stolen flowers.

1864
02:36:54,392 --> 02:36:59,834
[SPEAKER_02]: Perhaps he was bringing flowers to his newly found corpse that he was gonna have sex with.

1865
02:37:02,615 --> 02:37:03,535
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I give a damn.

1866
02:37:03,615 --> 02:37:03,995
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway.

1867
02:37:04,909 --> 02:37:08,551
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you steal flowers in the cemetery, then that's hella simple.

1868
02:37:09,531 --> 02:37:11,712
[SPEAKER_05]: Another Effie goes to Almost Breaking Lent.

1869
02:37:14,173 --> 02:37:15,954
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you get a semi-wood or something?

1870
02:37:16,915 --> 02:37:18,135
[SPEAKER_05]: Came close, but no wood.

1871
02:37:19,016 --> 02:37:24,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see, a friend of mine tested my ability to watch three hours of porn non-stop.

1872
02:37:25,159 --> 02:37:25,559
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like...

1873
02:37:27,042 --> 02:37:32,606
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to kill you, but then again, if I win this bet, I actually will get like a hundred bucks off of this.

1874
02:37:33,527 --> 02:37:36,449
[SPEAKER_03]: How are they going to know if you got a boner or not?

1875
02:37:37,790 --> 02:37:43,154
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since I'm an honest guy, I could just... That could be a lie.

1876
02:37:44,775 --> 02:37:46,256
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know what?

1877
02:37:47,377 --> 02:37:50,920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was a hardcore heroin addict and I quit.

1878
02:37:53,041 --> 02:37:53,782
[SPEAKER_02]: I won a hundred dollars.

1879
02:37:55,503 --> 02:37:56,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you guys know I'm a virgin?

1880
02:37:58,027 --> 02:37:59,008
[SPEAKER_05]: I did not know about that.

1881
02:38:00,228 --> 02:38:00,689
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

1882
02:38:04,551 --> 02:38:05,731
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, anyway, sorry, Explosive.

1883
02:38:06,031 --> 02:38:07,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how much time we have?

1884
02:38:07,972 --> 02:38:08,313
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1885
02:38:08,753 --> 02:38:09,793
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to take too long.

1886
02:38:10,834 --> 02:38:11,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Three seconds.

1887
02:38:12,215 --> 02:38:15,737
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, NFU goes to taxes.

1888
02:38:16,417 --> 02:38:19,999
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone got one of the numbers wrong that's needed to file taxes.

1889
02:38:21,101 --> 02:38:21,521
[SPEAKER_05]: And guess what?

1890
02:38:21,541 --> 02:38:24,122
[SPEAKER_05]: They come up to me and give me a mail saying that's the wrong number.

1891
02:38:24,262 --> 02:38:28,083
[SPEAKER_05]: If I don't get the correct number, then I would have been arrested or fined a shitload of money.

1892
02:38:28,803 --> 02:38:29,503
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, what the hell?

1893
02:38:29,543 --> 02:38:30,463
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is this the wrong number?

1894
02:38:31,724 --> 02:38:39,285
[SPEAKER_05]: Either the person who was coding up the... or accounting the tax is either lazy or just being a dick.

1895
02:38:41,166 --> 02:38:45,927
[SPEAKER_05]: After he goes to almost being sandwiched by three cars, both...

1896
02:38:47,267 --> 02:38:51,369
[SPEAKER_05]: Two of them in an SUV and one a truck behind me.

1897
02:38:51,389 --> 02:38:56,071
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what happens, like DarkSakura said, about people with the cell phones.

1898
02:38:56,472 --> 02:38:57,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I've actually seen that.

1899
02:38:57,772 --> 02:39:00,954
[SPEAKER_05]: But this time they didn't even signal while heading to the same lane.

1900
02:39:02,735 --> 02:39:03,775
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I almost got squashed.

1901
02:39:06,497 --> 02:39:07,777
[SPEAKER_05]: People need to learn how to drive.

1902
02:39:08,298 --> 02:39:10,419
[SPEAKER_05]: But to make sure this is short, to be continued.

1903
02:39:11,039 --> 02:39:12,220
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, Angel.

1904
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,000
[SPEAKER_17]: As usual.

[SPEAKER_17]: Um, okay, to, uh, follow up on Explicit's F.U.s, F.U.

1906
02:39:20,940 --> 02:39:32,729
[SPEAKER_17]: to death, because sometimes you lose people that, you know, really shouldn't have been taken away from you, as far as, you know, age or what have you.

1907
02:39:33,409 --> 02:39:35,271
[SPEAKER_17]: And F.U.

1908
02:39:35,291 --> 02:39:40,875
[SPEAKER_17]: to the grieving process as well, because, uh, it's not easy, it's really not.

1909
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:46,159
[SPEAKER_17]: And, yeah, so, I guess that's it.

1910
02:39:46,559 --> 02:39:48,000
[SPEAKER_17]: Maybe FU the finals this week.

[SPEAKER_03]: And for having the gall to be, to begging people to fight them.

[SPEAKER_03]: FU to having to pay $11 for a cab to leave the campus, all because of a damn bus straight up here in Westchester County in the subs of New York over petty shit that's not even worth the rider who heavily depends on it.

1915
02:40:19,704 --> 02:40:22,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Change... Oh, change being to bring.

1916

02:40:49,664 --> 02:40:53,728
[SPEAKER_03]: F you to drunk drivers for filling up an hour and 30 minutes worth of tragedy and gore in school.

1924
02:40:53,768 --> 02:40:55,109
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds like red asphalt to me.

1925
02:40:55,589 --> 02:40:56,811
[SPEAKER_03]: They made us all watch that shit.

1926

02:41:13,321 --> 02:41:13,962
[SPEAKER_03]: Guess what, buddy?

1930
02:41:14,002 --> 02:41:14,862
[SPEAKER_03]: You ain't a gangsta.

1935
02:41:34,963 --> 02:41:35,463

[SPEAKER_03]: And Dork says, F you to school because I don't know.

1956
02:42:44,760 --> 02:42:45,641
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm an attention whore.

1957
02:42:47,216 --> 02:42:49,919
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good note to end on, is the attention whore note there.

1958
02:42:49,939 --> 02:42:50,379
[SPEAKER_17]: I forgot one.

1959
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:51,700
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yes, Angel.

1960
02:42:52,561 --> 02:42:55,704
[SPEAKER_17]: F you to not one, but two deaths in one weekend.

1961
02:42:55,744 --> 02:42:56,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

1962
02:42:56,825 --> 02:42:59,027
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah, that's all that has to be said.

1963
02:42:59,328 --> 02:43:04,593
[SPEAKER_17]: Unless you want me to do a short but sweet explanation of that.

1964
02:43:05,536 --> 02:43:06,416
[SPEAKER_03]: I will leave it up to you.

1965
02:43:06,496 --> 02:43:08,378
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want you to have to get into it if you don't want to.

1966
02:43:08,919 --> 02:43:12,782
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, that one friend that I talked about at the beginning of the show passing away.

1967
02:43:13,523 --> 02:43:16,525
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we had a staff meeting for Herschel Radio.

1968
02:43:20,949 --> 02:43:27,935
[SPEAKER_17]: And right before the meeting ended, the manager got really, really quiet.

1969
02:43:27,995 --> 02:43:30,478
[SPEAKER_17]: And he's like, I just got a phone call.

1970
02:43:30,498 --> 02:43:32,079
[SPEAKER_17]: And everybody goes, what's wrong?

1971
02:43:33,382 --> 02:43:35,703
[SPEAKER_17]: My friend just got stabbed and he passed away.

1972
02:43:36,483 --> 02:43:37,003
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too bad.

1973
02:43:37,323 --> 02:43:40,024
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

1974
02:43:41,124 --> 02:43:42,944
[SPEAKER_17]: That was just craptacular.

1975
02:43:43,024 --> 02:43:45,785
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I'll shut up now and give you back the show.

1976
02:43:45,885 --> 02:43:46,705
[SPEAKER_03]: That's alright, that's alright.

1977
02:43:47,746 --> 02:44:00,009
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, on a completely different note, and when I say completely, I mean completely different note, Loki is looking up images on, I guess it's Bomani Styles image boards, and he's pulled up Poppin' Porn.

1978
02:44:00,129 --> 02:44:01,029
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell is this?

1979
02:44:02,835 --> 02:44:05,578
[SPEAKER_02]: It's back in their not-work-safe section.

1980
02:44:05,598 --> 02:44:07,940
[SPEAKER_02]: I just figured I'd take a look and see what's in there.

1981
02:44:08,761 --> 02:44:11,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got a lot of not-work-safe stuff in there.

1982
02:44:12,144 --> 02:44:16,288
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know who the fuck draws this shit, honestly.

1983
02:44:16,308 --> 02:44:18,490
[SPEAKER_02]: But apparently there's a lot of it out there.

1984
02:44:19,370 --> 02:44:22,553
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got some really graphic pictures.

1985
02:44:22,593 --> 02:44:24,535
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, for example, let's see here.

1986
02:44:27,237 --> 02:44:28,539
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this one right here.

1987
02:44:28,559 --> 02:44:28,799
[SPEAKER_02]: This is

1988
02:44:29,401 --> 02:44:32,462
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Japanese people that actually draw those pictures.

1989
02:44:32,482 --> 02:44:34,502
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a life!

1990
02:44:35,363 --> 02:44:37,163
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a life in Japan as well, yes.

1991
02:44:58,700 --> 02:45:03,343
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure, if you're Japanese, I say F you to having a Resident Evil 4 censored game.

1992
02:45:04,104 --> 02:45:12,910
[SPEAKER_05]: For those who haven't noticed, the Resident Evil 4 in Japan has no head cuts like Leon's head cut off or the zombies.

1993
02:45:13,890 --> 02:45:17,573
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a weird game, but without the heads cut off.

1994
02:45:17,633 --> 02:45:18,553
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid censorship.

1995
02:45:18,893 --> 02:45:25,258
[SPEAKER_05]: It's funny that they have more inappropriate stuff for other children compared to the ones we have in America.

1996
02:45:25,278 --> 02:45:25,898
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

1997
02:45:26,505 --> 02:45:26,786
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh well.

1998
02:45:27,567 --> 02:45:29,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Sucks to be in Japan for that.

1999
02:45:30,150 --> 02:45:32,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to go to a quick break, you guys.

2000
02:45:32,453 --> 02:45:35,818
[SPEAKER_03]: When we come back, some Ask Orange Lounge, because we haven't done it in a while.

2001
02:45:35,838 --> 02:45:38,682
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a question for us, send it over private message in the chat room.

2002
02:45:39,003 --> 02:45:40,565
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we're also going to wrap things up, you guys.

2003
02:45:40,605 --> 02:45:42,007
[SPEAKER_03]: So we will be back after this.

2004
02:45:58,533 --> 02:46:15,000
[SPEAKER_11]: Came in from a rainy Thursday on the avenue Thought I heard you talking so slowly I turned on the lights, the TV, and the radio Still I can't escape the ghost of you What is happening?

2005
02:47:29,890 --> 02:47:31,351
Thank you for watching

2006
02:48:06,678 --> 02:48:07,741
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks for watching!

2007
02:48:44,542 --> 02:48:50,365
[SPEAKER_23]: please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

2008
02:49:01,385 --> 02:49:04,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

2009
02:49:04,807 --> 02:49:08,049
[SPEAKER_03]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

2010
02:49:08,489 --> 02:49:11,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Loki ever find the Tekken 5 soundtrack?

2011
02:49:12,271 --> 02:49:15,433
[SPEAKER_03]: Or will Jamie be forced to taunt him because she has it already?

2012
02:49:15,713 --> 02:49:20,636
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you can see what we talk about in the studio on breaks.

2013
02:49:21,877 --> 02:49:24,118
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's start it off with a question from MPQ.

2014
02:49:24,859 --> 02:49:28,401
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister thinks all Taku songs sound the same.

2015
02:49:29,121 --> 02:49:30,642
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, this is unacceptable.

2016
02:49:31,294 --> 02:49:32,196
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I do to fix this?

2017
02:49:34,982 --> 02:49:36,045
[SPEAKER_19]: Chain her to a chair.

2018
02:49:36,586 --> 02:49:37,729
[SPEAKER_03]: I was thinking the exact same thing.

2019
02:49:38,832 --> 02:49:50,161
[SPEAKER_19]: and put her in one of those sensory deprivation things except that all it plays is Taku music and she'll learn the subtle differences.

2020
02:49:50,601 --> 02:49:51,061
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.

2021
02:49:52,282 --> 02:49:52,943
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what you should do?

2022
02:49:53,003 --> 02:50:04,832
[SPEAKER_03]: If she listens to CDs in the car, I don't know how old your sister is, assuming she's of drivable age, if she listens to CDs in the car or even the CDs in her CD player, switch out for Bounce Connected or other Taku albums.

2023
02:50:05,376 --> 02:50:08,739
[SPEAKER_03]: She'll thank you later for the great music you're providing her, trust me.

2024
02:50:10,401 --> 02:50:11,602
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, next up.

2025
02:50:12,042 --> 02:50:15,886
[SPEAKER_03]: RPGKing7 says, Question for all who use Stepmania.

2026
02:50:17,127 --> 02:50:21,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I was wondering if you have any tips for someone who has just started getting into it.

2027
02:50:21,961 --> 02:50:26,103
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit vague because we're not sure if you're talking about making step files or downloading.

2028
02:50:26,143 --> 02:50:29,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm assuming you're going to mean you just are getting into it for the first time and downloading.

2029
02:50:29,424 --> 02:50:31,385
[SPEAKER_05]: I can probably explain this since I am a sim artist myself.

2030
02:50:31,425 --> 02:50:33,506
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, make it quick though, explicit, because we've only got about 10 minutes.

2031
02:50:33,646 --> 02:50:40,009
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, the tips on sim files is one, select a good song that you feel like people would enjoy.

2032
02:50:41,209 --> 02:50:47,212
[SPEAKER_05]: And two, use programs like Acid or whatever.

2033
02:50:47,692 --> 02:50:49,633
[SPEAKER_05]: As long as you cut the track correctly.

2034
02:50:50,819 --> 02:50:51,199
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfectly.

2035
02:50:52,360 --> 02:50:56,083
[SPEAKER_05]: And three, try to also use DWI.

2036
02:50:57,084 --> 02:51:09,554
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure if other dudes' DWI tutorial is online, but if you need that, I can probably send it to you via AOL Instant Messenger for those who are interested in sim file making.

2037
02:51:09,735 --> 02:51:12,877
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're into sim file making, those are some good resources for you.

2038
02:51:12,897 --> 02:51:17,941
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're into sim file playing, my advice would be go and get some of those big pack songs, like Food Mix.

2039
02:51:18,942 --> 02:51:19,542
[SPEAKER_03]: and things like that.

2040
02:51:19,583 --> 02:51:22,324
[SPEAKER_03]: Go get some of those really, really well done sim files.

2041
02:51:22,645 --> 02:51:24,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for the high rated stuff on Bomani Style.

2042
02:51:25,046 --> 02:51:41,718
[SPEAKER_03]: Look for artists who have done a lot of songs because artists, you know, folks that have done, you know, when I say artists, I mean like step file background and so forth, artists, folks who have made a lot of songs have probably learned from their past mistakes so they start producing really quality stuff so look for that.

2043
02:51:42,639 --> 02:51:48,003
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it makes this, they have like, you can get the label either keyboard or pad so people do not like

2044
02:51:48,413 --> 02:51:50,694
[SPEAKER_05]: How did Orange Lounge Radio come about?

2045
02:52:19,493 --> 02:52:20,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you want to tell it or should I?

2046
02:52:20,754 --> 02:52:21,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you?

2047
02:52:22,676 --> 02:52:23,877
[SPEAKER_19]: We were on the BART.

2048
02:52:25,458 --> 02:52:26,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Bay Area Rapid Transit.

2049
02:52:27,660 --> 02:52:29,321
[SPEAKER_19]: Coming back from San Francisco, I thought.

2050
02:52:29,361 --> 02:52:31,743
[SPEAKER_19]: No, we first discussed it going to San Francisco.

2051
02:52:32,464 --> 02:52:34,225
[SPEAKER_19]: And then we finalized it on the way back.

2052
02:52:35,646 --> 02:52:41,291
[SPEAKER_19]: But we wanted to do the station for some time because I had a lot of fun subbing on Under Sedation.

2053
02:52:42,432 --> 02:52:46,315
[SPEAKER_19]: And Kay basically came up with the idea, everything that day.

2054
02:52:46,435 --> 02:52:48,657
[SPEAKER_19]: And we were broadcasting, what, in a couple weeks?

2055
02:52:48,857 --> 02:52:49,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, didn't take long.

2056
02:52:50,557 --> 02:52:54,738
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it's just, you know, we were having fun with Under Station Live.

2057
02:52:55,178 --> 02:53:01,560
[SPEAKER_03]: I know personally I was dying to sit behind the control panel for another show because Travis always sat behind the control panel for that show.

2058
02:53:01,960 --> 02:53:10,642
[SPEAKER_03]: So I kind of wanted to do one where I could sit behind the control panel just because I'd done it when I was doing college radio and stuff.

2059
02:53:10,702 --> 02:53:11,442
[SPEAKER_03]: So it worked out.

2060
02:53:11,562 --> 02:53:16,483
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jamie I knew was, you know, somebody I would want to do the radio show with because she had all that experience on Under Station.

2061
02:53:17,103 --> 02:53:20,484
[SPEAKER_03]: and also a vast knowledge of Bomani and video games in general.

2062
02:53:20,904 --> 02:53:22,385
[SPEAKER_19]: That's because I have no life.

2063
02:53:22,745 --> 02:53:23,885
[SPEAKER_03]: She made a good partner for that.

2064
02:53:23,925 --> 02:53:26,746
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out really good.

2065
02:53:27,166 --> 02:53:29,527
[SPEAKER_19]: He won a host spot for perfect attendance.

2066
02:53:29,547 --> 02:53:29,887
[SPEAKER_03]: He did.

2067
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:31,327
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

2068
02:53:33,068 --> 02:53:33,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Dark Knight.

2069
02:53:34,348 --> 02:53:35,668
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a question for Orange Lounge Radio.

2070
02:53:35,728 --> 02:53:39,890
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that Nintendo DS's online gimmick will be worth it?

2071
02:53:41,710 --> 02:53:44,931
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about this on the podcast this week, but the online gimmick.

2072
02:53:46,427 --> 02:53:51,568
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkTetsuya says, Here's what I meant to ask.

2073
02:53:51,608 --> 02:53:53,009
[SPEAKER_03]: What was everyone's first cata?

2074
02:53:53,029 --> 02:53:57,930
[SPEAKER_02]: So in DDR, your first catastrophic song that you beat.

2075
02:53:57,950 --> 02:53:58,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

2076
02:54:00,250 --> 02:54:02,051
[SPEAKER_03]: Jamie.

2077
02:54:17,651 --> 02:54:18,392
[SPEAKER_19]: My favorite one?

2078
02:54:18,772 --> 02:54:19,272
[SPEAKER_03]: Your first.

2079
02:54:19,472 --> 02:54:19,933
[SPEAKER_19]: My first?

2080
02:54:20,153 --> 02:54:20,233
[SPEAKER_19]: Oh.

2081
02:54:20,693 --> 02:54:22,294
[SPEAKER_19]: My first was Hypnotic Crisis.

2082
02:54:22,494 --> 02:54:23,735
[SPEAKER_03]: That was my first as well.

2083
02:54:24,936 --> 02:54:25,856
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody else care to share?

2084
02:54:26,737 --> 02:54:29,439
[SPEAKER_05]: I would say the same thing back then with Hypnotic Crisis.

2085
02:54:30,900 --> 02:54:32,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Paranoia Eternal.

2086
02:54:34,142 --> 02:54:34,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking easy.

2087
02:54:35,363 --> 02:54:41,707
[SPEAKER_05]: Or if you count Paranoia K-Set and Dropout before it became Switch as a 9, or Burn the Floor in Max 2.

2088
02:54:43,328 --> 02:54:44,108
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell's up with that?

2089
02:54:44,148 --> 02:54:44,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Burn in the floor?

2090
02:54:44,969 --> 02:54:45,589
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me a break.

2091
02:54:45,850 --> 02:54:46,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Ha ha ha.

2092
02:54:47,355 --> 02:54:48,115
[SPEAKER_03]: That was weird.

2093
02:54:48,135 --> 02:54:50,397
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember talking about that before, a long time ago on this show.

2094
02:54:51,377 --> 02:54:54,839
[SPEAKER_17]: I can express one I'm working on, although it probably wasn't the best choice.

2095
02:54:55,600 --> 02:54:57,621
[SPEAKER_17]: My Summer Love from, like, Fourth Mix.

2096
02:54:57,781 --> 02:54:59,362
[SPEAKER_03]: My Summer Love, I think, was my second one.

2097
02:54:59,422 --> 02:55:01,143
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's not a bad one to be trying, I don't think.

2098
02:55:01,243 --> 02:55:01,443
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

2099
02:55:01,743 --> 02:55:02,324
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion.

2100
02:55:02,904 --> 02:55:05,946
[SPEAKER_17]: Or like, um, no wait, that's like an eight, isn't it?

2101
02:55:06,026 --> 02:55:06,346
[SPEAKER_17]: Never mind.

2102
02:55:07,066 --> 02:55:07,467
[SPEAKER_17]: No, no, no.

2103
02:55:07,747 --> 02:55:11,249
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to say Spin the Disc, but I don't remember what number that is.

2104
02:55:12,209 --> 02:55:12,770
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, that's an eight.

2105
02:55:12,830 --> 02:55:13,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Never mind!

2106
02:55:14,031 --> 02:55:17,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, we're going to burn through some of these other questions real fast because we've got to wrap up the show here.

2107
02:55:17,933 --> 02:55:28,877
[SPEAKER_03]: Mikulatov, Dear AskOrangeLounge, seeing as how Sony doesn't seem to have as many ads out for its PSP but it's got so much hype behind it, do you think that it will be as huge of a hit as the PS2?

2108
02:55:32,498 --> 02:55:36,680
[SPEAKER_03]: When you phrase the question that way, will it be a bigger hit than the PS2, I have to say no.

2109
02:55:36,940 --> 02:55:39,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the PS2 is just untoppable in that regard.

2110
02:55:39,941 --> 02:55:40,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be a hit.

2111
02:55:41,021 --> 02:55:42,562
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think the PSP is going to be a failure.

2112
02:55:42,947 --> 02:55:46,590
[SPEAKER_03]: Legend of Zaku says, What was the worst Bomani-related drama you have ever seen?

2113
02:56:13,012 --> 02:56:13,672
[SPEAKER_03]: MGL2.

2114
02:56:15,173 --> 02:56:15,894
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember MGL2?

2115
02:56:15,934 --> 02:56:21,517
[SPEAKER_03]: That was pretty bad when we had the guy who smashed food all over the stage and stuff.

2116
02:56:22,338 --> 02:56:27,101
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god, weeks and weeks of web board posts after that.

2117
02:56:28,562 --> 02:56:32,204
[SPEAKER_19]: I just remember the local drama with certain people.

2118
02:56:32,844 --> 02:56:33,124
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2119
02:56:33,485 --> 02:56:33,805
[SPEAKER_19]: That was...

2120
02:56:34,269 --> 02:56:40,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, come to think of it, a lot of the big Bomani drama that I remember, I was directly involved with.

2121
02:56:40,511 --> 02:56:44,313
[SPEAKER_19]: Well, I'm not just saying that, I'm referring to other people too.

2122
02:56:44,513 --> 02:56:45,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.

2123
02:56:46,313 --> 02:56:51,775
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I know, when I think about Bomani drama, unfortunately, I think about the stuff that impacted me the most, which, you know.

2124
02:56:51,995 --> 02:56:57,938
[SPEAKER_19]: Of course, the two, I think, who were the greatest causes, I would say, are no longer in the scene.

2125
02:56:58,258 --> 02:56:59,058
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, true.

2126
02:57:00,646 --> 02:57:02,827
[SPEAKER_03]: LemonLimeJump says, What do you guys think of an Orange Lounge Radio Winamp skin?

2127
02:57:22,697 --> 02:57:25,238
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, if somebody wants to do one, that's awesome.

2128
02:57:25,298 --> 02:57:28,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I unfortunately have no artistic skill whatsoever.

2129
02:57:28,220 --> 02:57:28,860
[SPEAKER_21]: I have no time.

2130
02:57:29,040 --> 02:57:35,524
[SPEAKER_03]: But if somebody wants to make one, and we approve of it, and we're pretty easily win-over-able, we'll put it up in our download section on the website.

2131
02:57:35,644 --> 02:57:38,605
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be kind of a neat thing to have, because I know a lot of people use WAMP.

2132
02:57:38,945 --> 02:57:42,787
[SPEAKER_17]: As long as it works with the newest version or whatever, I'm cool with it, too.

2133
02:57:42,927 --> 02:57:43,968
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it can work.

2134
02:57:44,108 --> 02:57:44,748
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of them do.

2135
02:57:46,189 --> 02:57:50,211
[SPEAKER_03]: Any prospective artists out there that want to try that, hey, we will totally support you in that.

2136
02:57:50,231 --> 02:57:50,911
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a good idea.

2137
02:57:51,592 --> 02:57:52,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I never thought of that.

2138
02:57:52,722 --> 02:57:53,322
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good thought.

2139
02:57:54,363 --> 02:57:58,507
[SPEAKER_03]: And lastly, Illusion wants to know, why are people so lame?

2140
02:57:58,987 --> 02:58:01,029
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, WTF.

2141
02:58:01,930 --> 02:58:02,970
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are people so lame?

2142
02:58:03,651 --> 02:58:04,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their parents.

2143
02:58:05,573 --> 02:58:05,833
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah.

2144
02:58:07,454 --> 02:58:08,435
[SPEAKER_19]: They were raised badly.

2145
02:58:10,216 --> 02:58:10,537
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

2146
02:58:12,098 --> 02:58:15,161
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight.

2147
02:58:15,201 --> 02:58:16,662
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do it again in future weeks.

2148
02:58:16,702 --> 02:58:20,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, you can always ask us questions over on our forums, www.orangeloungeradio.com

2149
02:58:22,191 --> 02:58:23,612
[SPEAKER_03]: and just check out the forums over there.

2150
02:58:24,112 --> 02:58:25,653
[SPEAKER_03]: It's time to wrap up the show, you guys.

2151
02:58:25,753 --> 02:58:26,994
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a fun three hours.

2152
02:58:27,974 --> 02:58:31,536
[SPEAKER_03]: Next week on the show, more of what you've come to know and love.

2153
02:58:31,556 --> 02:58:33,837
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully we have more news on Night Style we can share with you guys.

2154
02:58:34,177 --> 02:58:39,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully Song Pack 9 makes its debut so we can give you guys our review on that and who knows what else.

2155
02:58:40,741 --> 02:58:43,082
[SPEAKER_17]: You're going to have a lost guest.

2156
02:58:43,282 --> 02:58:43,782
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's right.

2157
02:58:43,802 --> 02:58:43,862
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh!

2158
02:58:46,218 --> 02:58:52,684
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be that thingy on Saturday, which I need to... Yeah, thank you for reminding me about that, because I want to talk to these two about it after the show.

2159
02:58:53,304 --> 02:58:54,065
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank you.

2160
02:58:56,507 --> 02:58:57,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll tell you after the show.

2161
02:58:58,008 --> 02:58:59,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, final thought time!

2162
02:58:59,470 --> 02:58:59,870
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, guys.

2163
02:59:02,092 --> 02:59:06,836
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I wish there was a delay button that I could hit that would dump the stream so I could just say it and then dump it.

2164
02:59:07,277 --> 02:59:10,079
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, someday when we're real radio.

2165
02:59:10,479 --> 02:59:11,180
[SPEAKER_03]: Angel, your final thought.

2166
02:59:13,027 --> 02:59:16,330
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, Nintendo DS is going to be cool.

2167
02:59:17,431 --> 02:59:17,551
[SPEAKER_17]: Err.

2168
02:59:19,093 --> 02:59:20,214
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Explicit, your final thought.

2169
02:59:23,457 --> 02:59:24,578
[SPEAKER_05]: 33 days and still counting.

2170
02:59:25,058 --> 02:59:25,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Jesus Christ.

2171
02:59:27,051 --> 02:59:56,305
[SPEAKER_03]: my final thought is yes chat room there will be some outside the box this week because we've got Lanky Style and Rice Princess back and they're going to be reviewing the Dear Friends concert from this last Monday which is why they weren't able to make it this week and there was some other stuff going on which really exciting news Orange Lounge Radio is going to get some nice exposure I can't say much more than that we'll know more as the week goes on Loki I better not hear any crap about next week not this week

2172
02:59:57,299 --> 03:00:02,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Robot Chicken, which will feature a segment called A Day in the Life of Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen.

2173
03:00:03,762 --> 03:00:04,302
[SPEAKER_02]: No crap.

2174
03:00:04,823 --> 03:00:05,023
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
