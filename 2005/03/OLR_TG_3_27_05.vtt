And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:22.000 --> 00:26.000
Hello everybody, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

00:26.000 --> 00:30.800
our podcast which you've subscribed to where we talk about video games that

00:30.800 --> 00:35.720
don't suck and well sadly some that do because they just sneak in there but I

00:35.720 --> 00:40.720
think tonight we got a lot of games to talk about that don't suck my name is

00:40.720 --> 00:43.880
Rob Roberts you might know me as sky I'll be helping you make your way

00:43.880 --> 00:49.040
through this show joining me as always the lovely dark Sakura also known as

00:49.040 --> 00:54.960
Jamie Summers. Hi! The perky Jamie Summers. I'm just faking it. Oh, okay.

00:54.960 --> 01:03.440
Angstius always, huh? Always. All right. Also say hello to Loki. Hello. And how's

01:03.440 --> 01:06.860
that DS charger you've been working on? You were working on it during the three

01:06.860 --> 01:12.440
hour show. I'm on step six of 12. All right, for those who don't know, he's

01:12.440 --> 01:18.880
building a DS charger out of Legos. Now explain how this works, Loki. Basically,

01:18.880 --> 01:24.400
it's got the charging cord built into it and you just set the charger down or set

01:24.400 --> 01:28.820
the DS down on the charger like a you know a dock and there you go and it

01:28.820 --> 01:35.520
holds like no six games and three styluses huh and this is this is all

01:35.520 --> 01:39.220
something you found on a website yeah I browse a lot forums god bless the

01:39.220 --> 01:44.560
internet all right I like this idea of making your own cases out of Legos it's

01:44.560 --> 01:49.440
brilliant concept. Alright let's get into what's going on in our own personal

01:49.440 --> 01:55.320
gaming world this week. Of course the PSP launched this past week. I know somebody

01:55.320 --> 01:58.320
in here has got to have had to put their hands on one at some point. I know it was

01:58.320 --> 02:02.200
probably Dark Sakura, am I right?

02:02.200 --> 02:09.360
Maybe. Your voice is cracking. What has been going on in your gaming world?

02:09.360 --> 02:16.240
Silent Hill 3 lots of it not the PSP and no because somebody else has been

02:16.240 --> 02:25.500
playing his new limb someone who will not be named Dan I'm sorry oh or not

02:25.500 --> 02:34.540
named fiance or hetero life partner all right so you so you haven't really had a

02:34.540 --> 02:39.000
chance to play the PSP at all I played it I played Darkstalkers what

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
What did you think of it?

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
It was Darkstalkers.

02:41.000 --> 02:42.000
What do you think?

02:42.000 --> 02:43.000
It was actually really cool.

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
What do you think of the PSP?

02:44.000 --> 02:45.000
I'm really curious to your thoughts.

02:45.000 --> 02:46.000
Surely you've watched it.

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
It's really awesome.

02:47.000 --> 02:53.280
It has a, you know, the little LED HD screen thingy, and plays movies and MP3s and Screw

02:53.280 --> 02:54.280
the iPod.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.800
Hey, I still like my iPod.

02:56.800 --> 03:01.960
Yeah, but, see, where you paid $400 for your iPod.

03:01.960 --> 03:02.960
I paid $300.

03:02.960 --> 03:06.000
We paid $250 for the...

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Whatever.

03:07.000 --> 03:08.000
Okay.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
And we've got five games too.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.000
Ooh, and is Darkstalkers your favorite out of the five?

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
It's the only one I've played, but I really, really, really, really, really like Ridge Racer.

03:19.000 --> 03:22.000
It's purdy, and it has Reiko in it, so it's all good.

03:22.000 --> 03:26.000
Cool. Anything else you want to share about your gaming week?

03:26.000 --> 03:30.000
I played Final Fantasy XI for ten minutes.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
You're cutting back, huh?

03:32.000 --> 03:34.000
I was doing other stuff.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.000
I have a Final Fantasy XI story tonight. It's pretty interesting.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
We'll get to it in a minute.

03:37.000 --> 03:41.360
But first, Loki, what's been going on in your gaming world, besides the DS charger?

03:41.360 --> 03:44.520
I've been playing a ton of games, actually.

03:44.520 --> 03:49.680
I bought God of War, which I've been playing a lot of that.

03:49.680 --> 03:50.680
It's really awesome.

03:50.680 --> 03:53.480
They're calling that the Ninja Gaiden of PS2.

03:53.480 --> 03:54.480
What do you think?

03:54.480 --> 04:00.320
No, it's very, very similar to Devil May Cry 3, actually.

04:00.320 --> 04:01.320
Oh, okay.

04:01.320 --> 04:05.480
Because there's a whole combo system in there, and it's pretty, it's just really good.

04:05.480 --> 04:10.520
And they did everything right with this game, like graphics are amazing, the sound is amazing,

04:10.520 --> 04:14.600
and just the sheer detail that's in this game, like you'll be running through Athens because

04:14.600 --> 04:18.740
the whole game obviously is about like Greek mythology and that kind of stuff.

04:18.740 --> 04:23.060
So you're running through Athens and you have Ares far in the background like destroying

04:23.060 --> 04:26.840
these armies while you're fighting and stuff in the foreground and stuff.

04:26.840 --> 04:30.640
And so it basically looks like Lord of the Rings, you know, where you have him he's just

04:30.640 --> 04:33.960
like tossing armies in the air and just like stuff like that.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.200
and there's fireballs and crap that he's throwing,

04:36.200 --> 04:39.000
hitting buildings nearby you and stuff, and you're running.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.880
There's another part where you have to go

04:40.880 --> 04:43.920
to the Temple of Pandora, which is on the back of a Titan,

04:43.920 --> 04:47.560
a giant monster-type thing.

04:47.560 --> 04:49.920
And as you're climbing around the castle and stuff,

04:49.920 --> 04:52.800
they'll show scenes and you can see the Titan walking

04:52.800 --> 04:55.600
and everything, just tons of detail.

04:55.600 --> 04:56.720
And correct me if I'm wrong,

04:56.720 --> 04:57.920
but there's nudity in this game.

04:57.920 --> 04:59.600
There is full-frontal nudity,

04:59.600 --> 05:02.200
and there's a sex minigame. Awesome.

05:02.200 --> 05:04.200
So you gotta love that.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.880
And then it's violent and bloody as hell.

05:06.880 --> 05:09.320
And it's really cool, they've got these like,

05:09.320 --> 05:12.560
cinematic, like combos, little mini game type things.

05:12.560 --> 05:14.640
And when you're going to kill like an enemy or whatever,

05:14.640 --> 05:16.440
they'll have you do certain button presses,

05:16.440 --> 05:18.880
and it basically does it very cinematically.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.680
And your weapon of choice in this game

05:20.680 --> 05:24.400
is like these two giant, like, knife, sword things

05:24.400 --> 05:27.800
that are on chains, and it's just really pretty.

05:27.800 --> 05:28.720
Wow, all right.

05:28.720 --> 05:30.960
So definitely highly recommend, you know,

05:30.960 --> 05:36.080
going out and getting that game is awesome. The other game I got was Time Splitter 3 because

05:36.080 --> 05:41.100
I just love the Time Splitter series. I love how they have actually gotten really good

05:41.100 --> 05:45.160
with it because the first game's story mode sucked, second game it was pretty good, third

05:45.160 --> 05:50.760
game's story mode was pretty good actually. And they've got a lot of stuff that's been

05:50.760 --> 05:58.320
added to it. Just a lot of like, you know, a lot of different elements into it. 150 playable

05:58.320 --> 06:02.520
characters that you can unlock through the entire game, and like TimeSplitters, the other

06:02.520 --> 06:07.180
games, they have a challenge mode where you play like these mini games that are really

06:07.180 --> 06:11.840
off the wall, strange, anything from like, you know, survival like in a haunted house

06:11.840 --> 06:17.480
thing to shooting off heads, breaking windows, driving a cat, and playing hoops, they're

06:17.480 --> 06:22.080
driving a cat, driving a cat, it's a cat with wheels on it, I don't know, it's just driving

06:22.080 --> 06:26.440
a cat, cat racing game, I don't get it, but that's what it is.

06:26.440 --> 06:31.900
They've got, supposedly there's a thing that hints a Tony Hawk type game that's in there.

06:31.900 --> 06:35.720
Just like it's so immersive and there's so many characters you can play.

06:35.720 --> 06:40.280
Of course, one of the things that sets Time Slayers apart from other games is the ability

06:40.280 --> 06:43.240
to make your own deathmatch maps.

06:43.240 --> 06:45.920
Really good system that's only gotten better.

06:45.920 --> 06:51.800
Online gameplay for the Playstation 2, Xbox, Gamecube, probably not, but online gameplay

06:51.800 --> 06:53.060
for those.

06:53.060 --> 06:58.500
so that'll be pretty interesting. And just like I said, the story mode's awesome. It's

06:58.500 --> 07:03.160
very, very well done, like the graphics and everything. A lot of fun, actually.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.160
Alright.

07:04.160 --> 07:08.380
And then, of course, you know, the other two games I had, of course, were the ones I mentioned

07:08.380 --> 07:13.500
last week. Gran Turismo 4, which I haven't really played much of, and then Dog's Life,

07:13.500 --> 07:18.120
which I must say that this dog is wandering through a world of the most lazy people I

07:18.120 --> 07:23.040
I've ever seen that want this dog to like perform miracles for them. I'm like god damn

07:23.040 --> 07:27.440
it. This girl's like, I want you to build me a snowman. I'm like, it's a fucking dog.

07:27.440 --> 07:32.640
It doesn't do snowmen. What the hell? So I threw poop at her.

07:32.640 --> 07:37.600
Okay, as a dog would. So have you played any games you don't like lately? It seems like

07:37.600 --> 07:42.920
you're really enjoying all these games. Um, no.

07:42.920 --> 07:50.560
I really did like God of War and stuff, and I don't know, Gran Turismo is not really doing

07:50.560 --> 07:54.700
it for me, because I don't really play much at Gran Turismo, I don't know, it's just...

07:54.700 --> 07:56.180
But at least it's pretty if nothing else.

07:56.180 --> 08:00.580
It's pretty, but I think what the problem was is I remember once I bought it, you know,

08:00.580 --> 08:03.940
and I've had it in the house for a while, for about a week, I'm just starting to think

08:03.940 --> 08:08.460
like, you know, I didn't really play much of the first game when I bought it, I'm like,

08:08.460 --> 08:12.140
ah crap, kinda wanted like a new Ridge Racer game or something like that, because that'd

08:12.140 --> 08:18.460
be fun like burnout 3 or something you know I'm pretty cool but I still like it

08:18.460 --> 08:22.140
you know I just have to get into it and play it some more and I'll you know love

08:22.140 --> 08:26.900
it again sounds good in my gaming world not a whole lot new I've still been

08:26.900 --> 08:30.340
playing Zelda minish cap and I'm almost done with it but that's pretty much been

08:30.340 --> 08:34.540
taking a lot of my time however I did get to get my grubby little paws on the

08:34.540 --> 08:41.840
PSP that Dan has for about about seven minutes or so I got to play either now

08:41.840 --> 08:44.480
there's a little controversy over how this game is pronounced it's either

08:44.480 --> 08:49.540
Lumines or Luminous and I guess Luminous is probably the more proper one but a

08:49.540 --> 08:52.160
lot of you probably been calling this game Lumines. I gotta play this game for about

08:52.160 --> 08:56.360
seven minutes loved every minute of it oh my gosh that game is hot I really

08:56.360 --> 09:01.240
want a PSP not just for that game but it's just pretty and you can see movies

09:01.240 --> 09:04.520
on it and stuff not that the movies on the PSP were kinds of things I'd really

09:04.520 --> 09:08.640
want to see anyway but I just think it's so neat that there's all this stuff you

09:08.640 --> 09:11.720
can do that's you know in your pocket. Now don't get me wrong though I still love

09:11.720 --> 09:16.120
my DS and I think the DS is going to get better in the next few months. So I

09:16.120 --> 09:20.280
really don't see things as a DS versus PSP thing. I know a lot of people have

09:20.280 --> 09:23.760
been saying it's one or the other. For me, I think both of them have a lot of

09:23.760 --> 09:28.360
exciting things to promise over the next few months. We will see what happens. All

09:28.360 --> 09:31.920
right, let's get into some gaming news going on. We'll start it off with the PSP

09:31.920 --> 09:35.440
since, of course, there's a lot of stuff going on with the PSP. One of them being

09:35.440 --> 09:40.720
the dead pixels going on with the PSPs. You've probably heard of this. Maybe what

09:40.720 --> 09:45.400
this happened to one of your friends, but a lot of these PSPs apparently have dead pixels

09:45.400 --> 09:52.760
or do they? Sony is responding to the reports going on right now. It's commonly referred

09:52.760 --> 09:57.600
to as a defect, however Sony is saying that this is a problem that actually happens in

09:57.600 --> 10:03.540
all LCD screens. Says Sony, a very small number of dark pixels or continuously lit pixels

10:03.540 --> 10:09.180
is normal for LCD screens and is not a sign of malfunction.

10:09.180 --> 10:15.060
Page 13 of the PSP manual says this, red, blue, or green spots or black spots may appear

10:15.060 --> 10:17.580
in certain locations on the LCD screen.

10:17.580 --> 10:22.720
The appearance of such spots is a normal occurrence associated with LCD screens and not a sign

10:22.720 --> 10:24.820
of malfunction.

10:24.820 --> 10:27.440
So what should you do if this is happening to you?

10:27.440 --> 10:32.060
They're suggesting that you try this out for a week or two, but if it continues to bother

10:32.060 --> 10:39.060
then you can use your one-year warranty that comes with a PSP.

10:39.060 --> 10:42.060
All the details are on page 125 of the manual.

10:42.060 --> 10:44.060
You know what's funny?

10:44.060 --> 10:49.060
I swear I've got this game system called the DS that has two LCD screens

10:49.060 --> 10:51.060
and guess what? It doesn't happen there.

10:51.060 --> 10:52.060
Why does it happen on yours?

10:52.060 --> 10:54.060
Okay, but you know what's weird is I have heard of it happening on the DS.

10:54.060 --> 10:55.060
Maybe it's not happening on yours.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.060
But here's the thing though.

10:57.060 --> 11:03.260
But it's not a common thing, because I have a LCD screen at work, I can tell you this

11:03.260 --> 11:08.220
much, I've had it on for a long time, it doesn't have any dead pixels in it, my DS doesn't

11:08.220 --> 11:12.380
have any dead pixels in it, my Game Boy Advance doesn't have any dead pixels in it, why does

11:12.380 --> 11:14.820
your PSPs have a lot of dead pixels in it?

11:14.820 --> 11:19.260
Because you're using chip parts, and that's why you're trying to cover it up saying, oh

11:19.260 --> 11:21.340
it's completely normal!

11:21.340 --> 11:22.340
Completely normal!

11:22.340 --> 11:29.060
It's somewhat higher quality than what you might find on your conventional PC monitor.

11:29.060 --> 11:34.120
It happens with HDTVs all the time.

11:34.120 --> 11:40.740
So the advice I heard, and we were talking about this on the 3 hour program, Dan the

11:40.740 --> 11:43.420
man was here talking about the PSP.

11:43.420 --> 11:47.180
Try putting in the movie that most of you guys got with your PSP.

11:47.180 --> 11:51.620
Put in Spiderman and try watching it and see if that unfreezes the pixel.

11:51.620 --> 11:54.980
different tricks like that try something doing something a little different maybe

11:54.980 --> 11:58.520
it'll help so hopefully we saved you some headache there if you're one of

11:58.520 --> 12:01.920
those folks that has the PSP of the dead pixel I hope when I get mine though I

12:01.920 --> 12:07.460
never have this problem because that will make me sad speaking of the PSP

12:07.460 --> 12:14.720
very interesting some folks are using wipeout pure to be browsing the internet

12:14.720 --> 12:18.320
Loki I know you love reading about the hack stuff what's going on with this

12:18.320 --> 12:21.960
They're using the Wipeout, I guess there's a function in the game where you can actually

12:21.960 --> 12:26.460
view the website, and I don't think the website's up right now or something, and so people are

12:26.460 --> 12:32.320
actually using it as a proxy or a way to bounce off of it to visit other websites such as

12:32.320 --> 12:38.920
Slashdot and Hackaday, where I'm guessing this probably was featured in an article.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.920
I actually found the link from Slashdot, but you know.

12:41.920 --> 12:46.880
Well Slashdot steals from Hackaday all the time, because people that read Slashdot read

12:46.880 --> 12:52.500
hackaday and yada yada yada very interesting not everything works though

12:52.500 --> 12:56.420
some things don't work like you know JavaScript frames of course you know you

12:56.420 --> 13:00.260
can't expect all that kind of stuff to work but apparently you can actually use

13:00.260 --> 13:04.340
Google because you can use the X button on the PSP and it brings up a little

13:04.340 --> 13:09.540
keyboard so you can use that to type in things so very interesting there but

13:09.540 --> 13:16.060
here's what you need to be doing on there I'm looking up internet yeah see

13:16.060 --> 13:24.620
now that would be cool is if you can download stuff to the DS just oh my god

13:24.620 --> 13:29.360
that would be hilarious PSP to get spyware that's what oh yeah I know how

13:29.360 --> 13:33.020
how many days did it take him to install Linux on the PSP they don't know they've

13:33.020 --> 13:36.940
done it yet oh my gosh it's a miracle hey it's only coming I mean it takes a

13:36.940 --> 13:41.060
while you know like a couple days we'll see all right if you want more

13:41.060 --> 13:45.940
information on how to use wipeout peers hidden web browser head on over to this

13:45.940 --> 13:53.260
website it's www.fumanchu.com

13:53.260 --> 13:59.900
slash pspdev and they'll have all the information there on that hopefully that

13:59.900 --> 14:02.980
website doesn't get crashed hopefully it stays up there but it's probably gonna get

14:02.980 --> 14:09.740
hit with a lot of folks um also going on in the PlayStation world now this is a

14:09.740 --> 14:13.580
pretty big story but we don't have a lot of information at this time this is

14:13.580 --> 14:18.500
actually another article that was on Slashdot, but they're saying that

14:18.500 --> 14:24.340
according to Japan Today, the US District Court in Oakland, California has ordered

14:24.340 --> 14:29.900
Sony and its US unit to pay 90.7 million dollars in damages to

14:29.900 --> 14:34.820
Immersion Corp for patent infringement over controllers used with PlayStation

14:34.820 --> 14:39.100
game consoles. In the ruling, which was handed down Thursday, the federal court

14:39.100 --> 14:42.780
also ordered Sony Computer Entertainment and Sony Entertainment America to stop

14:42.780 --> 14:47.340
selling the PlayStation and PlayStation 2 game consoles using DualShock

14:47.340 --> 14:52.680
controllers as well as more than 40 game software products. Very

14:52.680 --> 14:57.360
interesting if this is actually coming to light. I mean there could be a stay. We

14:57.360 --> 15:00.920
don't know this is all kind of developing right now so we don't know

15:00.920 --> 15:04.800
this will certainly be something we hear about more this week but my first

15:04.800 --> 15:08.640
thought is those PlayStation controllers have been around for like 10 years it's

15:08.640 --> 15:12.000
it's just now coming to be a patent issue what's going on with that is that

15:12.000 --> 15:21.760
really how slow our legal system is or what I guess but still what is going on

15:21.760 --> 15:25.000
with that do you think this is gonna hold what do you think they're actually

15:25.000 --> 15:28.240
gonna have to stop selling PlayStation's because somebody else said it's Sony no

15:28.240 --> 15:36.360
but Loki any thoughts on this have you heard anything about this is the first

15:36.360 --> 15:40.320
this is the first I've heard of it and it sounds pretty stupid actually it's

15:40.320 --> 15:44.440
like why is it taking so long oh now we figured out we can make money by suing

15:44.440 --> 15:48.880
them you know I've heard of you know other things like this before where

15:48.880 --> 15:52.560
they've sued for different things you know that's been around forever you know

15:52.560 --> 15:58.840
so and I guess it sounds like they've won already so they just need to work it

15:58.840 --> 16:04.080
out working out there's always appeals they need to work it out I'd be kind of

16:04.080 --> 16:09.600
curious to why they waited so long hmm to be honest we have some various online

16:09.600 --> 16:14.080
multiplayer online news. We have three of them. I promised we would do a story

16:14.080 --> 16:17.840
about Final Fantasy 11. This is kind of interesting. This is only going to apply

16:17.840 --> 16:21.520
to the Japanese version of Final Fantasy 11, but they're going to be doing a

16:21.520 --> 16:25.160
campaign called the Welcome Back Campaign. It's going to be going on from

16:25.160 --> 16:31.320
April 14th to July 13th, and if you are a retired Final Fantasy 11, sign up on the

16:31.320 --> 16:35.400
game's official site and you can get your play online and Final Fantasy

16:35.400 --> 16:40.220
registration codes reissued by Squeenix, meaning that you can return to the game

16:40.220 --> 16:45.660
with your old characters intact and you'll be able to play the game free for

16:45.660 --> 16:50.940
30 days! So they're trying to sucker you back into the addicting world of Final

16:50.940 --> 16:56.020
Fantasy 11. I know all you guys are currently in Final Fantasy 11 but let's

16:56.020 --> 16:59.860
say they reinstated this type of similar thing in a game that you've maybe left

16:59.860 --> 17:04.420
like Dark Sakura for you maybe Ragnarok or PSO is this something you jump on?

17:04.420 --> 17:10.660
They've given free months and I hadn't ever re-registered.

17:10.660 --> 17:12.660
Do you think that's the main reason why they do this?

17:12.660 --> 17:17.460
Your character, on Ragnarok Online, if you were in the second beta, you'd keep your character forever.

17:17.460 --> 17:17.960
Oh cool.

17:17.960 --> 17:23.600
So I could go a year from now if I wanted to play RO again and my character would still be there at her same levels.

17:23.600 --> 17:24.240
Oh cool.

17:24.240 --> 17:30.440
So, um, do you think this is just something they're doing to sucker people back into it and get obsessed with Final Fantasy again?

17:30.440 --> 17:30.940
Yes.

17:30.940 --> 17:32.940
You know, probably good business sense.

17:32.940 --> 17:34.740
Lucky, what about you? What do you think of the idea?

17:34.740 --> 17:35.340
Are you...

17:35.340 --> 17:37.640
Cause you're somebody who's still paying for Final Fantasy XI.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.340
Are you a little ticked off that somebody else is gonna get 30 free days just because they quit?

17:41.340 --> 17:42.540
Whatever. Who cares?

17:43.940 --> 17:45.140
I really don't.

17:45.140 --> 17:47.140
I mean, so what? They get it for free.

17:47.140 --> 17:50.340
You know what I mean? That's just like, you know, all those cable companies out there that...

17:50.340 --> 17:53.440
You know, hey, you get the movie channels for free if you, you know, join us.

17:53.440 --> 17:54.940
Then people are like, ah!

17:54.940 --> 17:56.340
Why are they doing that?

17:56.340 --> 17:59.840
So there's actually retarded people out there that will actually quit and come back.

17:59.840 --> 18:04.680
they get the free movie channels, like, you're an idiot, but, whatever, you know, hey, try

18:04.680 --> 18:08.120
to get them back because, you know, they've got competition now with World of Warcraft

18:08.120 --> 18:12.080
and stuff, so, good luck, but I don't think it's gonna work.

18:12.080 --> 18:19.440
Speaking of World of Warcraft, this week, World of Warcraft was patched to version 1.3.0,

18:19.440 --> 18:25.760
and what they've added, like chat bubbles, brand new chat bubbles, quest trackers, and

18:25.760 --> 18:28.520
a brand new dungeon, which is called Dire Maul.

18:28.520 --> 18:32.980
Now I know that nobody here is that into World of Warcraft, but it's kind of neat.

18:32.980 --> 18:37.040
I know it's a very insanely popular game, it is a game I still want to check out as

18:37.040 --> 18:41.300
soon as I officially part from Final Fantasy XI because technically I'm still on it, but

18:41.300 --> 18:42.300
not much longer.

18:42.300 --> 18:45.940
I do want to check out at least World of Warcraft, give it a chance, but I know it's insanely

18:45.940 --> 18:52.100
popular so I'm sure this download, which is going to be 62 megabytes of a chat, a lot

18:52.100 --> 18:55.140
of folks are going to be really happy about this one.

18:55.140 --> 18:59.580
They're saying that the chat bubbles are kind of like what you see in EverQuest 2, which

18:59.580 --> 19:02.020
should be very interesting.

19:02.020 --> 19:05.040
The new area, by the way, the new dungeon, it's kind of interesting because it seems

19:05.040 --> 19:08.060
like whenever they put in new areas in a game, it's always for high levels.

19:08.060 --> 19:12.780
Yeah, you're going to have to be level 56 to 60 if you want to get to this new area,

19:12.780 --> 19:15.740
Dire Maul.

19:15.740 --> 19:23.180
Also going on in other online RPGs, the Matrix Online finally started, so it just launched

19:23.180 --> 19:24.180
this week.

19:24.180 --> 19:28.380
talking on the last podcast about when the matrix online stopped its beta did

19:28.380 --> 19:33.140
that pretty hilarious sign off now tell me look yeah I don't know how much

19:33.140 --> 19:35.380
you've heard about this you've been following matrix online more than I have

19:35.380 --> 19:38.660
is it true now I thought I was reading something where they've actually hired

19:38.660 --> 19:44.140
people to be actors in the matrix online yep that is their job to play this game

19:44.140 --> 19:49.740
and move the story yeah they're hired to play the main characters like Niobe

19:49.740 --> 19:54.340
Morpheus, etcetera, etcetera, and they're hired to do that.

19:54.340 --> 19:58.400
Wow. They need to hire me. I know, seriously, I mean, this just makes me think, my gosh,

19:58.400 --> 20:02.100
now kids everywhere will be able to tell their parents, see,

20:02.100 --> 20:06.460
you can make a living playing video games. I mean,

20:06.460 --> 20:11.140
wow. Well, also just ask any game tester, but still.

20:11.140 --> 20:14.100
Still though, there's a difference between game testing and then actually

20:14.100 --> 20:17.300
like immersing yourself in this world, I mean, really.

20:17.300 --> 20:23.300
I could, I would love to do that, you know, but I don't think that after a while it would get kind of old.

20:23.300 --> 20:28.300
Yeah, I wonder if they switch characters once in a while, liven it up, or how they do that. That's kind of weird.

20:28.300 --> 20:33.300
I wonder if they're always on 24 hours a day or what they do. If they switch, I don't know.

20:33.300 --> 20:35.300
It'd be cool just playing Neo.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.300
Well apparently they do have Neo running around in there somewhere.

20:38.300 --> 20:40.300
I don't think so, he's dead.

20:40.300 --> 20:44.300
Oh, I thought he was in there somewhere. They said that he's spotted.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.300
That's just a myth.

20:45.300 --> 20:50.580
well you know how could they not even dead or not I mean you know Freddy's

20:50.580 --> 20:54.720
died how many times bring them back and they'll do a fucking trilogy again yeah

20:54.720 --> 21:02.820
exactly so yeah now this last bit of MMORPG news I have isn't quite exactly

21:02.820 --> 21:09.600
about the game itself but the ramifications that getting really into

21:09.600 --> 21:15.600
an MMO can have. Sony Online Entertainment just sent some notice that

21:15.600 --> 21:22.520
there has been a baby named after a character in EverQuest. Player Tabitha

21:22.520 --> 21:29.400
Ayers gave birth to a baby girl on January 6 2005 and promptly named her

21:29.400 --> 21:34.780
Furriona Valle Ayers. And these people right here should have their membership

21:34.780 --> 21:41.260
canceled and they should be castrated in honor of EverQuest famous spokes-elf

21:41.260 --> 21:50.260
very interesting named after an MMORPG character loser what do you think but I

21:50.260 --> 21:54.900
mean they named babies after rock stars and movie character and all those people

21:54.900 --> 22:02.780
should be castrated just as well there was someone that Dan knew that named

22:02.780 --> 22:08.360
their kid Molina Molina I actually like the name Molina but I would if I were

22:08.360 --> 22:11.840
to name my kid Molina I wouldn't name it because of moral combat that we're

22:11.840 --> 22:19.520
naming our first our first kid Richter so is this necessarily worse than that

22:19.520 --> 22:25.100
or no although every quest is really stupid but I think this kid's gonna get

22:25.100 --> 22:29.600
teased this person should have named their kid after like a cool game instead

22:29.600 --> 22:34.840
of like oh you know proving to the universe that they're an addict sorry I

22:34.840 --> 22:40.000
might name like I always thought Strider was a good name for a guy but not

22:40.000 --> 22:45.000
necessarily the same way really a name it's a job but you know it's also a name

22:45.000 --> 22:50.480
I knew kids yeah if you change the spelling alter it a little bit so all

22:50.480 --> 22:55.720
right anyway kind of an interesting story there that now kids are getting

22:55.720 --> 22:59.960
named after MMOs but hey you know if they name kids after rock stars and

22:59.960 --> 23:04.920
movies I guess that's just a logical progression. Alright for those you guys

23:04.920 --> 23:09.220
out there we want to give you a way to better your life we're not just here to

23:09.220 --> 23:12.480
fill you in on the latest in video gaming and what's going on we want to

23:12.480 --> 23:16.160
better your life when you're not playing those games and to do that we have the

23:16.160 --> 23:23.280
lovely Dark Sakura giving you her advice column. Dark Sakura what did you pick to

23:23.280 --> 23:28.000
discuss tonight with our listeners this is how to escape from a bad date who

23:28.000 --> 23:34.400
this now this is necessary I this is good how do you do this okay you can

23:34.400 --> 23:38.880
fake an emergency excuse yourself from the table tell your date that you are

23:38.880 --> 23:42.800
going to the restroom to wash up take yourself in with you if you'd not have

23:42.800 --> 23:46.720
one locate a restaurant fun that's out of your date sign a vision bring a

23:46.720 --> 23:51.240
restaurant matchbook or a business card that has a restaurants phone number call

23:51.240 --> 23:52.960
Call a friend or relative for help.

23:52.960 --> 23:56.720
Tell them to call you, either on your cell phone or on the restaurant's phone, and pretend

23:56.720 --> 23:57.720
there has been an emergency.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.480
Believable emergencies are personal crisis.

24:00.480 --> 24:04.480
My friend just broke up with her husband, she's having a breakdown, I have to go.

24:04.480 --> 24:05.480
Business crisis.

24:05.480 --> 24:08.800
My boss just called, she's in Seattle for a major presentation and has lost all of her

24:08.800 --> 24:09.800
files.

24:09.800 --> 24:11.720
I have to email them to her immediately.

24:11.720 --> 24:12.720
Health crisis.

24:12.720 --> 24:16.840
My sister just called, our grandmother is alone and ill.

24:16.840 --> 24:18.800
Leave quickly before your date can protest.

24:18.800 --> 24:21.080
Apologize but refuse any attempt.

24:21.080 --> 24:25.240
date makes to accompany you. If you leave swiftly without hesitation your date

24:25.240 --> 24:29.360
won't have time to understand what's happening or to object and then you slip

24:29.360 --> 24:35.520
away unnoticed. Number one, identify your escape route. Observe your surroundings.

24:35.520 --> 24:39.560
Take note of the exits especially the back doors for the best way out or an

24:39.560 --> 24:43.940
alternative. Two, plan to alter your appearance. Think about your most

24:43.940 --> 24:47.240
distinctive features and figure out how to hide or disguise them. The person

24:47.240 --> 24:50.080
you're trying to leave is going to see figure moving past away at a distance

24:50.080 --> 24:56.040
Let me be focusing on that first impression if you are not familiar to him and are an interesting you will not get a second

24:56.040 --> 24:57.080
look

24:57.080 --> 25:02.160
Three excuse yourself from the table move to the restroom or any private area with a mirror to begin your transformation

25:02.560 --> 25:08.000
Your day will probably wait two or three minutes before expecting you to return so act quickly before he begins looking for you

25:08.760 --> 25:14.100
For add and remove clothing layering garments will change your body shape and even suggest a different gender

25:14.620 --> 25:16.620
Along coat will obscure your body

25:16.620 --> 25:20.740
so if you're a guy and you want to scare your date off come back to the table

25:20.740 --> 25:25.660
wearing a dress hats are especially useful because they conceal your hair

25:25.660 --> 25:30.540
or facial features eyeglasses whether added or removed work wonders the

25:30.540 --> 25:35.060
shopping bag is hand is a handy prop and can be used to hold your belongings

25:35.060 --> 25:40.060
five change your welcome posture if you walk quickly move slowly you stand up

25:40.060 --> 25:45.820
straight hunch over six use or remove cosmetics blah blah blah seven change

25:45.820 --> 25:50.980
your hairstyle or color. Rubber band, hairspray, water, or gooey substance will help.

25:50.980 --> 25:55.540
8. Adopt a cover roll. A lady in the restaurant may have an apron and be carrying a tray.

25:55.540 --> 25:59.220
If you can manage to procure these items, as you attract a pair of eyeglasses and alter

25:59.220 --> 26:02.980
your hairline or hairstyle, you will become invisible by moving out of the restaurant.

26:02.980 --> 26:08.640
And put on a fake mustache. Make your move. Do not look at your date. You can climb out

26:08.640 --> 26:13.660
of a window. You can use things to break the window, such as a wastebasket, toilet plunger,

26:13.660 --> 26:18.260
handbag or briefcase. You can even use a paper towel dispenser. You have to hit it

26:18.260 --> 26:23.140
in the center though. Or, if all else fails, get your date to leave. Say something

26:23.140 --> 26:28.260
offensive. Behave inappropriately. Send your date on a fool's errand. Tell him

26:28.260 --> 26:32.020
you want to go to a specific nightclub, but explain that it's very crowded and

26:32.020 --> 26:38.700
so he cannot go in after you. But my advice in the end, don't go out with a

26:38.700 --> 26:49.380
loser thank you huh also in gaming news this week for how to determine the

26:49.380 --> 26:56.100
gender of your date I have to save that for a future advice column Soulcalibur

26:56.100 --> 27:01.620
3 is coming out but it ain't coming out in the arcade and even though link was

27:01.620 --> 27:05.260
so cool on the GameCube it ain't coming out on the GameCube it is a PlayStation

27:05.260 --> 27:11.340
2 exclusive title Soulcalibur 3. Namco has announced it it'll come out later

27:11.340 --> 27:17.660
this year. So far they've only announced three new characters and I'm gonna

27:17.660 --> 27:20.740
totally butcher the pronunciations of his name so just deal with it.

27:20.740 --> 27:28.380
Tira, Setsuka, and Zasamel. There's too many letters in that one. Two returning

27:28.380 --> 27:32.540
characters will be coming back for sure as well. Mitsuruigi and Taki.

27:32.540 --> 27:38.280
Mitsurugi, Mitsurugi. Sorry, I didn't play a lot of Soulcalibur. I always played ivy. I like the easy to pronounce names

27:39.500 --> 27:45.780
There was a neat making of file, but I didn't really get to watch because somebody else watching it

27:47.240 --> 27:49.500
On I do believe this on game spot

27:50.160 --> 27:55.400
Also what they're saying about Soulcalibur 3 is that you will be able to create your own character

27:55.400 --> 27:59.180
So now it's going to be Barbie dress-up Soulcalibur. So that'll be fun. That is totally up my alley

27:59.180 --> 28:08.260
But the Zamzahamuel uses a scythe.

28:08.260 --> 28:09.260
That's cool.

28:09.260 --> 28:10.260
That was cool.

28:10.260 --> 28:11.260
I did see the pictures.

28:11.260 --> 28:14.300
One of those looks just like Lulu.

28:14.300 --> 28:18.860
Tyra uses a giant chakram.

28:18.860 --> 28:20.820
I think that's the one that looks just like Lulu.

28:20.820 --> 28:22.500
No, it must be the other one.

28:22.500 --> 28:25.380
There's one I swear that looks just like Lulu from Final Fantasy X.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.380
Like when I saw the pictures.

28:26.380 --> 28:28.860
They're going into some neat weaponry.

28:28.860 --> 28:33.460
kind of neat. But it's kind of a bummer because I really thought Soul Calibur was best on

28:33.460 --> 28:38.780
the GameCube and yes 95% of that was because Link was in it. So it's kind of a bummer that,

28:38.780 --> 28:42.680
well actually. Actually the Xbox one was really good. Back it up a little bit. Soul Calibur

28:42.680 --> 28:47.460
2 was really best in the arcade. So I'm really surprised that Soul Calibur 3 is not coming

28:47.460 --> 28:54.700
to the arcade. I don't get that but whatever. I guess really good news for Soul Calibur

28:54.700 --> 28:59.340
fans that have playstations well and also the arcade market is kind of in a

28:59.340 --> 29:02.980
decline true it's just kind of sad though because there are some really

29:02.980 --> 29:05.980
like I thought the conquest idea was pretty neat and it kept people

29:05.980 --> 29:10.020
entertained and having your character being built on there it's kind of I don't

29:10.020 --> 29:16.340
know it's kind of too bad but there you have it going back to a really really

29:16.340 --> 29:21.220
old series actually I think this one's been it's been like slowly coming and

29:21.220 --> 29:24.820
going but I just remember this old game on Nintendo I don't know if you were

29:24.820 --> 29:28.480
ever into these games but it all started off with a game called Nobunaga's

29:28.480 --> 29:33.480
ambition the strategy yes you remember this game on Nintendo well they're

29:33.480 --> 29:39.160
actually gonna put out a brand new one on the PC this summer now this news is

29:39.160 --> 29:44.000
coming out of Japan which and the name when translated means Nobunaga's

29:44.000 --> 29:49.560
ambition revolution it's gonna cost a hundred and seven dollars in u.s. funds

29:49.560 --> 29:54.180
yeah that's a lot of money but is it so much I guess they're just come with like

29:54.180 --> 30:02.320
maps and books and crap I have no idea no idea it comes with your own soldier

30:02.320 --> 30:07.700
but there is days in your house there's a teaser page planes at you www.game

30:07.700 --> 30:17.060
city dot n e dot JP slash kakushin k k a k u sh in so if you want to check out

30:17.060 --> 30:20.220
that would be Japanese for this game is too damn expensive

30:20.220 --> 30:25.220
no one on his ambition was a cool game thus why I had to bring it up because I

30:25.220 --> 30:26.420
remember that game on into my

30:26.420 --> 30:30.260
mission we created so expensive I remember when we went to the singer

30:30.260 --> 30:31.700
trying to sell that game on ebay

30:31.700 --> 30:35.020
did it work did you find buyer I think we got five bucks for it

30:35.020 --> 30:38.060
room I'll

30:38.060 --> 30:43.460
couple more stories tonight bungee has revealed that they will be doing nine

30:43.460 --> 30:46.940
Brand new maps for Halo 2, but there's a catch

30:47.300 --> 30:52.320
They're only going to be available for a fee on Xbox live if you don't have Xbox live

30:52.320 --> 30:55.940
I don't know what the hell you're doing with Halo 2 and not having Xbox live

30:55.940 --> 31:02.360
But if you don't have Xbox live you can get a separate $20 add-on DVD that will have all the maps for you

31:02.700 --> 31:06.360
The first maps will come out on live late in April

31:06.360 --> 31:09.800
It's going to have two free maps, so you will get two of them for free

31:09.800 --> 31:14.960
but then you're gonna have to do two for purchase but they are saying that all

31:14.960 --> 31:19.920
the maps will be free at some point on live by the end of the summer so I don't

31:19.920 --> 31:23.960
know what's going on with that but then they'll be five more well I think it's

31:23.960 --> 31:27.840
just those four but then there'll be five more on live with the DVDs release

31:27.840 --> 31:32.640
but you know there's people out there that play Halo 2 all the time and they

31:32.640 --> 31:35.440
will pay the money for these new maps even if they're going to be free in

31:35.440 --> 31:40.980
three months you know it but I don't I don't get the point of the DVD because

31:40.980 --> 31:45.520
honestly how can you have have halo 2 and not have live unless well maybe

31:45.520 --> 31:49.940
maybe you're the type that plays in the dorm with the local area but really I

31:49.940 --> 31:54.500
mean halo 2 was made is made for live so I mean it has a decent single-player

31:54.500 --> 32:00.260
mode but what's the point of the new maps anyway one more story so did they

32:00.260 --> 32:06.100
mentioned that those new maps would have an actual ending for the game no no

32:06.100 --> 32:09.340
we're in there but you're the though the new quest will begin where you're

32:09.340 --> 32:12.420
searching for the end of the game but unfortunately you will not find it and

32:12.420 --> 32:15.900
you'll be utterly disappointed but guess what there'll be another $20 patch later

32:15.900 --> 32:19.940
on where there maybe it will be an ending but we can't guarantee anything

32:19.940 --> 32:24.860
unless we figure out more money we'll make you buy that Japanese game it's

32:24.860 --> 32:29.420
$100 this is nobody this is probably related to that story we reported on a

32:29.420 --> 32:33.200
couple weeks ago about the Korean Xbox site announcing some type of expansion

32:33.200 --> 32:37.580
for Halo probably is the same thing so I think that answers our questions there

32:37.580 --> 32:47.300
maybe not but probably one last story shadow the hedgehog has a date and it's

32:47.300 --> 32:53.260
going to be coming out this winter on the Xbox GameCube and the PlayStation 2

32:53.260 --> 33:01.300
being developed by Sega Studios USA that explains that VG cats comic then and in

33:01.300 --> 33:08.580
other news halo 2 the search for more money of course we don't know the rating

33:08.580 --> 33:11.820
of the pricing yet however in shadow the hedgehog you will be able to control

33:11.820 --> 33:15.500
whether shadow is a hero or a villain and it all depends on the paths you

33:15.500 --> 33:21.500
choose it's going to be you're shooting and racing through over 50 missions but

33:21.500 --> 33:27.860
can you marry the same sex in that game shadow fable what the hell comment way

33:27.860 --> 33:31.660
out of left field it's just like fable fable you can marry the same sex I know

33:31.660 --> 33:34.820
fable and shadow the hedgehog have nothing in common except that shadow

33:34.820 --> 33:41.860
will be on Xbox as well well shit no I mean there aren't that many female

33:41.860 --> 33:48.340
hedgehogs running around so I mean shadow Amy well if one she does you you

33:48.340 --> 33:53.060
know, foreweighed by all the other characters. We just need a knuckle solo game. Anyway,

33:53.060 --> 33:57.400
I think on that note, we definitely need to wrap things up. Uh, Loki, any parting words

33:57.400 --> 34:03.620
for our listeners? I mean, honestly, what's he gonna do for some lovin'? My parting words

34:03.620 --> 34:07.540
are goodbye, and keep your fingers crossed that I beat MinishCap this week, so I have

34:07.540 --> 34:14.700
something new to talk about. Uh, DarkSakura, your final? Piranha River suck. Thank you
