00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:51,435
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're just a sideshow to the website www.orangeloungeradio.com where we actually have a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station where we play a lot of video game music, especially stuff from Konami's Beatmania series, or Bomani series, I should say, as well as DDR, etc., etc.

8
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:52,436
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of good stuff on there.

9
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:53,877
[SPEAKER_02]: And then other video game stuff, too.

10
00:00:53,917 --> 00:00:54,998

00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,227
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

15
00:01:01,307 --> 00:01:03,147
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me as always is my awesome co-host.

16
00:01:03,207 --> 00:01:05,608
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.

17
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,469
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.

18
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:07,669
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you?

19
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,190
[SPEAKER_01]: I have diseased lungs.

20
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:18,933
[SPEAKER_02]: You've kind of got the 80-year-old grandma thing going on right now because of your infection.

21
00:01:19,793 --> 00:01:22,274
[SPEAKER_01]: I sound like a broken-necked ghost.

22
00:01:22,614 --> 00:01:23,495
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope you feel better.

23
00:01:23,755 --> 00:01:24,195
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

24
00:01:24,415 --> 00:01:24,735
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

25
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:26,941
[SPEAKER_03]: And Loki is here as well.

26
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:27,761
[SPEAKER_03]: Say hello, Loki.

27
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:28,702
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I am.

28
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:31,525
[SPEAKER_03]: Eating my five pounds of gummy bears.

29
00:01:32,586 --> 00:01:33,527
[SPEAKER_03]: Gummy bears.

30
00:01:34,808 --> 00:01:35,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Stronger than the average bear.

31
00:01:36,069 --> 00:01:37,851
[SPEAKER_03]: No, these things are like crack.

32
00:01:38,071 --> 00:01:41,554
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, honestly, I gotta put them down, because otherwise I will feel sick.

33
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:47,079
[SPEAKER_03]: And because, for some reason, your body does not like five pounds of gelatin inside of it.

34
00:01:47,099 --> 00:01:49,081
[SPEAKER_02]: Throwing up gummy is no fun, either.

35
00:01:49,862 --> 00:01:50,242
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've heard.

36
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:52,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get into it.

37
00:01:53,629 --> 00:01:57,653
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get to some gaming news, but let's talk about what's going on in our gaming world lately.

38
00:01:57,733 --> 00:01:59,354
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?

39
00:02:00,075 --> 00:02:04,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Tekken 5, Tekken 5, Tekken 5, and Final Fantasy XI.

40
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,500
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Tekken 5 going?

41
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:10,504
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome, but Mishima Jinpachi is a bastard.

42
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:15,008
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really quickly, tell me the best thing about Tekken 5 and the worst thing about Tekken 5.

43
00:02:15,548 --> 00:02:17,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's always been Jin.

44
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,691
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing?

45
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:22,538
[SPEAKER_02]: Jinpachi And his stupid gut fireball And then Julia is like sucky to dodge it

46
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Devil Jin has his old moves.

47
00:03:05,962 --> 00:03:06,742
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy.

48
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:11,723
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played a lot of the arcade mode where you earn the points so you can customize your character?

49
00:03:12,063 --> 00:03:16,324
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we've been doing because we've got Eddie Gordo, we have Panda.

50
00:03:18,384 --> 00:03:25,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you like though how they have, have you played a lot of one player arcade because it has like the made up names that you play against and some of them are really funny.

51
00:03:25,545 --> 00:03:27,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we did that, no we just were doing story mode.

52
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:34,567
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out because if you play one player arcade you get to play against like fake personalities like it's a real arcade, it's really funny some of the names, pretty cool.

53
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:38,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I do like seeing the Roger Jr.

54
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:40,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Mokujin conversation.

55
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,591
[SPEAKER_01]: That was funny.

56
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,392
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Mokujin.

57
00:03:42,832 --> 00:03:43,512
[SPEAKER_02]: I miss that guy.

58
00:03:43,653 --> 00:03:44,093
[SPEAKER_02]: He was cool.

59
00:03:44,953 --> 00:03:45,373
[SPEAKER_01]: He's in it.

60
00:03:45,554 --> 00:03:45,774
[SPEAKER_02]: Is he?

61
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,755
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I just haven't unlocked him yet.

62
00:03:47,835 --> 00:03:49,015
[SPEAKER_02]: I've only unlocked a couple characters.

63
00:03:49,075 --> 00:03:50,696
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing a lot of Tekken 5 this week as well.

64
00:03:50,716 --> 00:03:52,137
[SPEAKER_01]: He talks in woodblock language.

65
00:03:53,698 --> 00:03:55,779
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever hear woodblocks like in Marching Band?

66
00:03:56,348 --> 00:03:56,588
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

67
00:03:57,089 --> 00:03:57,749
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he sounds like.

68
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:58,490
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's funny.

69
00:03:58,971 --> 00:04:01,333
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool because in Tekken they all have their native languages.

70
00:04:01,373 --> 00:04:04,056
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny that Mokujin has a... And, of course, Roger Jr.

71
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:06,979
[SPEAKER_01]: is hanging out in Mommy's pouch speaking kangaroo.

72
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:09,902
[SPEAKER_02]: What does kangaroo sound like?

73
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:10,722
[SPEAKER_02]: Care to demonstrate?

74
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:11,203
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

75
00:04:11,463 --> 00:04:11,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

76
00:04:13,324 --> 00:04:16,506
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Loki, what have you been up to this week in the game world?

77
00:04:16,846 --> 00:04:25,550
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing Final Fantasy XI, and I've been playing, well, I tried playing some Neo Contra, but for some reason it wasn't working.

78
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:31,273
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I played some, actually, some arcade stuff.

79
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:38,157
[SPEAKER_03]: I played Alien vs. Predator all the way through, and I also played the guy game again.

80
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,921
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just determined to see as many boobs as possible, aren't you?

81
00:04:42,561 --> 00:04:43,441
[SPEAKER_02]: Ran a porn!

82
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:47,402
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about the fact that there's boobs in it.

83
00:04:47,442 --> 00:04:48,682
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really the point.

84
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:51,783
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a fun party game, and the trivia is a lot of fun.

85
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:53,823
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Trivial Pursuit with boobs.

86
00:04:54,184 --> 00:04:55,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Mario Party is a fun party game.

87
00:04:56,184 --> 00:04:57,924
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy game is boobs.

88
00:04:57,944 --> 00:05:08,107
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a good trivia game, honestly, because there hasn't been a good You Don't Know Jack game for the home console system in a while, so this will have to do.

89
00:05:09,468 --> 00:05:11,595
[SPEAKER_02]: Besides it has boobies in it.

90
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:12,959
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I was looking for.

91
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:13,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

92
00:05:15,095 --> 00:05:19,759
[SPEAKER_02]: As for me, this week I've been playing, well, Tekken 5 as well, but Jamie already mentioned that.

93
00:05:19,799 --> 00:05:23,561
[SPEAKER_02]: So I will mention I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, specifically Final Fantasy 2.

94
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:27,244
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been trying to just get further along in that game.

95
00:05:27,624 --> 00:05:35,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I decided I was going to force myself to take a break from Final Fantasy 11 this week because, you know, I'm just, I'm ODing on it, honestly, and it's getting stupid.

96
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,591
[SPEAKER_02]: So I need to take a minute to play some other games.

97
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:42,815
[SPEAKER_02]: So Final Fantasy 2, which, yeah, I go from one Final Fantasy to another, I know, big

98
00:05:43,215 --> 00:05:43,855
[SPEAKER_02]: Big wow, right?

99
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,636
[SPEAKER_02]: But I figure, you know what?

100
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:46,977
[SPEAKER_02]: I spent the money on Dawn of Souls.

101
00:05:47,077 --> 00:05:49,779
[SPEAKER_02]: I ought to, you know, check it out and play it a little more.

102
00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:55,682
[SPEAKER_02]: So, because I kind of gave up on Final Fantasy 1 because I was like, I already know this from the NES.

103
00:05:55,702 --> 00:05:56,763
[SPEAKER_02]: I already know this story.

104
00:05:56,783 --> 00:05:58,804
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the graphics, okay, I'm done with that now.

105
00:05:59,044 --> 00:06:01,085
[SPEAKER_02]: But Final Fantasy 2, it's still very fresh to me.

106
00:06:01,485 --> 00:06:06,708
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really got into it, even when it was translated and out in ROM form on the internet years ago.

107
00:06:07,009 --> 00:06:07,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I never really got into it.

108
00:06:07,909 --> 00:06:09,910
[SPEAKER_02]: So now I'm kind of getting into it and it's kind of cool.

109
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:11,171
[SPEAKER_02]: So,

110
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:16,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I also forgot to mention in the guy game, I got one point at the end of the game.

111
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:25,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I got zero points because I bet on the wrong girl to win the guy challenge, I guess is what it was.

112
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:29,603
[SPEAKER_03]: Where basically they have to do something stupid topless or whatever.

113
00:06:30,024 --> 00:06:30,684
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got it wrong.

114
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:37,968
[SPEAKER_03]: So they reward you with some crew member, some big fat hairy guy that's doing like sultry stuff and I thought that was very hilarious.

115
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:38,949
Whatever.

116
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:40,670
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

117
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:46,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into some video game news, some stuff that's actually going on out there this week.

118
00:06:47,105 --> 00:06:49,706
[SPEAKER_02]: Big news, Metal Gear Solid 4 is confirmed.

119
00:06:49,746 --> 00:06:50,907
[SPEAKER_02]: It is going to be happening.

120
00:06:51,167 --> 00:06:56,509
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a press event in Berlin to celebrate the release of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater in Europe.

121
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,951
[SPEAKER_02]: The next game in the Metal Gear Solid series was confirmed.

122
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:09,375
[SPEAKER_02]: Although Hideo Kojima always said that Metal Gear was kind of going to be a trilogy, of course these games sell very well and they're going to live on.

123
00:07:10,136 --> 00:07:12,977
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just that Hideo Kojima is going to step aside in this one.

124
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:15,635
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just going to be executive producer.

125
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:20,459
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, Kenichiro Imezumi is going to be taking over as the title's producer.

126
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,241
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can expect some new things to come out of Metal Gear.

127
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:25,203
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a Metal Gear fan, right?

128
00:07:26,164 --> 00:07:28,265
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think about Hideo Kojima stepping aside?

129
00:07:28,285 --> 00:07:31,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think it's going to be a fresh look for the series?

130
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:33,630
[SPEAKER_01]: He's still going to have control over the basic elements.

131
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,612
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not going to let anything go outside his vision.

132
00:07:35,632 --> 00:07:40,316
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as he's executive producer, I don't feel like producing your stupid ideas.

133
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,883
[SPEAKER_02]: I think things will be okay.

134
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:46,485
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of not a big surprise.

135
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:48,746
[SPEAKER_02]: We were talking about this on Outside the Box on Thursday night.

136
00:07:51,089 --> 00:07:55,952
[SPEAKER_02]: Kojima, he's been threatening to do it for a while, so it's not a big surprise.

137
00:07:56,152 --> 00:07:59,774
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a perfect example would be the Silent Hill series.

138
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:13,381
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't remember the original creator of it, but then you have Akira Yamaoka stepping up to actually write the series 3 and 4, whereas someone else is doing 1 and 2, and he was just doing the music for it.

139
00:08:13,861 --> 00:08:15,362
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be a good thing.

140
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:16,963
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it is a good thing, actually, because...

141
00:08:18,559 --> 00:08:31,668
[SPEAKER_03]: He's probably run out of, not really run out of ideas, but, you know, having some, you know, actual, someone else helping to create this, it'll be a little bit better because, you know, some fresh new ideas can come from it.

142
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:41,054
[SPEAKER_03]: And, obviously, since he's still the executive producer of it, you know, it's not going to just turn into something awful like that you might see in, I don't know, a video game movie.

143
00:08:43,375 --> 00:08:44,756
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we'll see what happens with that.

144
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:46,997
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to seeing more stuff on Metal Gear Solid 4.

145
00:08:49,045 --> 00:08:53,286
[SPEAKER_01]: I just think it needs to have Dave Snake again.

146
00:08:54,206 --> 00:09:01,168
[SPEAKER_01]: I always call Solid Snake Dave Snake if you ever played through the first Metal Gear Solid.

147
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:05,509
[SPEAKER_02]: Metal Gear Solid are games I've watched and not played a whole lot.

148
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:06,869
[SPEAKER_02]: I've played them a little bit, but not a whole lot.

149
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:08,990
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear Solid 3 was all about Big Boss.

150
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:12,111
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing will trump the original Metal Gear for me.

151
00:09:12,231 --> 00:09:13,651
[SPEAKER_02]: The truck have started to move.

152
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:17,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, did they mention which console this is going to come out?

153
00:09:17,946 --> 00:09:19,007
[SPEAKER_03]: Next Gen, probably?

154
00:09:20,627 --> 00:09:21,828
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it was Next Gen.

155
00:09:22,068 --> 00:09:22,308
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

156
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:24,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember.

157
00:09:24,269 --> 00:09:26,509
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the story in front of me anymore, but I think it was Next Gen.

158
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:28,030
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.

159
00:09:29,271 --> 00:09:34,453
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever want to give feedback, by the way, if you want to yell at us for being wrong or whatever, you just want to say, hello, hi, how you doing?

160
00:09:34,553 --> 00:09:38,094
[SPEAKER_02]: Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.

161
00:09:38,114 --> 00:09:40,475
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd love to answer some viewer mail in the podcast.

162
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:44,147
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten anything really appropriate for that yet, so something to think about.

163
00:09:44,187 --> 00:09:55,075
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question you'd like us to address on the podcast, send it over to go at orangelaunchradio.com ESRB, the Entertainment Software Rating Board, they have introduced a brand new rating.

164
00:09:55,115 --> 00:09:57,377
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how games are rated, very similar to movies.

165
00:09:57,777 --> 00:10:08,665
[SPEAKER_02]: They have ratings such as Childhood, EC, Everyone, E, Teen, T, Mature, M, Very Rare, Adults Only, but you probably see that in the guy game.

166
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:11,606
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, but now they've got a brand new rating.

167
00:10:11,626 --> 00:10:12,706
[SPEAKER_02]: They just unveiled a new rating.

168
00:10:12,766 --> 00:10:14,648
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called E10+.

169
00:10:16,009 --> 00:10:24,156
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to categorize those games that may not be necessarily family friendly, but they're not quite really worthy of a T rating as well.

170
00:10:24,717 --> 00:10:37,087
[SPEAKER_02]: So Donkey Kong Jungle Beat would be an example of a game that would get like an E10 plus rating because it's kind of not really for everybody per se, but it's not really a game that needs to be teen rated either.

171
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:38,188
[SPEAKER_02]: So thoughts on that?

172
00:10:39,460 --> 00:10:40,781
[SPEAKER_01]: is called They Should Rate It.

173
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,522
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents, do your research.

174
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:46,625
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents, do your job.

175
00:10:47,365 --> 00:10:49,027
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the rating system does its job?

176
00:10:50,468 --> 00:10:57,953
[SPEAKER_01]: The only good that comes of it is giving an overall indicator so that if a parent actually feels like doing their job, they can look at the game and get an idea.

177
00:10:58,213 --> 00:11:06,098
[SPEAKER_03]: So where's the rating that's, um, if you're under 17 and you buy this, we're going to, um, sue the pants off you.

178
00:11:06,378 --> 00:11:08,380
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, or like, um,

179
00:11:09,537 --> 00:11:11,619
[SPEAKER_03]: This game may cause you to go murder someone.

180
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:34,744
[SPEAKER_02]: Retarded idea.

181
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:34,865
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?

182
00:11:34,905 --> 00:11:36,506
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a way for them to make money.

183
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:37,326
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, um... First of all...

184
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:01,893
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily going to be the store's fault.

185
00:12:01,953 --> 00:12:09,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Having gone into my fiancé's store plenty of times, I see where someone will pick up a game, walk around the store with it, and put it on the bottom shelf.

186
00:12:10,895 --> 00:12:15,936
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there shouldn't be any reason that the store should be held accountable for some other poor idiots, you know.

187
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:18,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is retarded.

188
00:12:19,137 --> 00:12:22,918
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, Sir, I cannot reach that game on the high shelf.

189
00:12:22,978 --> 00:12:24,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you please get it down for me?

190
00:12:24,598 --> 00:12:25,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there you go, got the game.

191
00:12:26,499 --> 00:12:27,559
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't stop anyone.

192
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:29,730
[SPEAKER_02]: It's discrimination against short people.

193
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:32,411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's midget discrimination.

194
00:12:32,511 --> 00:12:33,291
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor midgets.

195
00:12:34,411 --> 00:12:37,232
[SPEAKER_02]: Is no one thinking of the midget gamer?

196
00:12:38,532 --> 00:12:40,433
[SPEAKER_02]: Midgets want Grand Theft Auto 2.

197
00:12:40,973 --> 00:12:41,613
[SPEAKER_03]: What the hell?

198
00:12:42,433 --> 00:12:45,414
[SPEAKER_03]: What does it matter that they can reach the game?

199
00:12:45,834 --> 00:12:49,914
[SPEAKER_03]: The person that's behind the counter shouldn't be selling the mature game to them anyways.

200
00:12:50,475 --> 00:12:51,075
[SPEAKER_03]: What's it matter?

201
00:12:51,195 --> 00:12:53,535
[SPEAKER_02]: The parents shouldn't be giving the kids the money to buy the game.

202
00:12:53,555 --> 00:12:55,796
[SPEAKER_01]: When I was in 6th grade, I was just under 5 feet.

203
00:12:56,656 --> 00:12:57,616
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could reach up

204
00:12:58,573 --> 00:12:59,414
[SPEAKER_01]: and grab something.

205
00:13:00,774 --> 00:13:01,695
[SPEAKER_01]: This is retarded.

206
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:03,236
[SPEAKER_01]: How old is this senator?

207
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:04,497
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea.

208
00:13:04,877 --> 00:13:15,304
[SPEAKER_03]: To be honest here, okay, violent games, I don't even see how these can be, you know, even close to being equal to like violent movies or violent TV.

209
00:13:16,184 --> 00:13:17,845
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just completely like two different things.

210
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:21,187
[SPEAKER_03]: It'd be like depicting a piece of art with blood in it.

211
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:22,288
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my god.

212
00:13:23,149 --> 00:13:25,070
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really sad.

213
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:47,224
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it doesn't stop there, you guys, because also coming out on the Newswire this week, three Washington State representatives, Jim McCune, Jim McDermott, and Mary Lou Dickerson, they co-authored a bill that will hold game companies responsible if a minor commits a violent act that is seemingly inspired by a video game they played.

214
00:13:47,644 --> 00:13:49,085
[SPEAKER_01]: That's even more stupid.

215
00:13:49,566 --> 00:13:51,507
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, yeah, that's not fair.

216
00:13:51,627 --> 00:13:52,668
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just straight up not fair.

217
00:13:52,688 --> 00:13:53,048
[SPEAKER_01]: That's called...

218
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:59,144
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to find a scapegoat because parents don't want to take any responsibility for what their children do.

219
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:04,149
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why their children are acting this way is because it's their own damn fault.

220
00:14:04,829 --> 00:14:10,274
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would freaking pay to have a press conference to announce to all these parents that they're idiots.

221
00:14:10,835 --> 00:14:13,477
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you got the podcast.

222
00:14:13,517 --> 00:14:17,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Parents of America, do your goddamn job.

223
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,203
[SPEAKER_01]: If your child is a little hellion, spank them!

224
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:25,305
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's wrong with this whole United States?

225
00:14:25,766 --> 00:14:29,209
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the goddamn balls have left the judicial system.

226
00:14:29,729 --> 00:14:36,735
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are the judges out there that go when these people go, Yeah, my kid killed this kid and he learned it in Grand Theft Auto.

227
00:14:37,115 --> 00:14:39,217
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe he learned it because you're a bad parent.

228
00:14:39,357 --> 00:14:42,420
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you what, she's on TV every night at 7 o'clock.

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,601
[SPEAKER_02]: Judge Judy, thank you.

230
00:14:44,601 --> 00:14:44,962
[SPEAKER_01]: You know...

231
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:47,470
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the news.

232
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:48,671
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch the fucking news.

233
00:14:49,531 --> 00:14:50,971
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch fucking CNN.

234
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:53,632
[SPEAKER_01]: And so-and-so killed so-and-so.

235
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:55,573
[SPEAKER_01]: And kids thinking, huh.

236
00:14:57,153 --> 00:14:58,494
[SPEAKER_01]: I have violent tendencies.

237
00:14:58,574 --> 00:14:59,534
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be on the news.

238
00:15:01,414 --> 00:15:02,475
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just ridiculous.

239
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:03,615
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

240
00:15:03,715 --> 00:15:11,157
[SPEAKER_03]: Next thing you're going to have Al-Qaeda suing Microsoft because they learned to fly airplanes in the buildings from Microsoft Flight Simulator.

241
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:13,498
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all Microsoft's fault.

242
00:15:14,156 --> 00:15:16,078
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always Microsoft's fault, but that's another story

243
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:56,271
[SPEAKER_02]: 60 Minutes was going to be airing a segment and it has to do with the battle between the families of a slain Alabama police officer I'm sorry, actually multiple Alabama police officers and the makers and the sellers of the Grand Theft Auto franchise because there was a lawsuit that was sparked by the deaths of three Alabama police officers who were killed by a teen who said he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto

244
00:15:57,574 --> 00:15:58,635
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about scapegoat.

245
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:01,037
[SPEAKER_01]: The game made me do it, Mommy!

246
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:05,059
[SPEAKER_01]: That's because Mommy facilitated him having the game.

247
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:10,363
[SPEAKER_01]: There were plenty of times I wanted games, and my mama wouldn't buy them for me.

248
00:16:10,744 --> 00:16:11,564
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the interesting thing.

249
00:16:12,425 --> 00:16:17,989
[SPEAKER_02]: The arrest of Devin Moore, who is allegedly responsible for the crime, 18 years old.

250
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:20,731
[SPEAKER_01]: He's hangable.

251
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:28,203
[SPEAKER_02]: More allegedly said, life's like a video game.

252
00:16:28,503 --> 00:16:29,744
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gotta die sometime.

253
00:16:31,084 --> 00:16:31,924
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm sorry.

254
00:16:32,184 --> 00:16:34,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like Grand Theft Auto do not teach you how to kill.

255
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:37,105
[SPEAKER_03]: Games like Area 51 teach you how to kill.

256
00:16:37,425 --> 00:16:42,567
[SPEAKER_03]: That gives you fucking, you know, hand-eye coordination and you get better aim playing some games like that.

257
00:16:43,127 --> 00:16:47,888
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of games that'll teach you how to kill is a game like Time Crisis or a gun game like that.

258
00:16:48,228 --> 00:16:50,869
[SPEAKER_03]: Grand Theft Auto, I push a button and it fires a gun.

259
00:16:51,661 --> 00:16:52,422
[SPEAKER_03]: That David Chappelle skit

260
00:17:03,484 --> 00:17:04,765
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Ridge Racer taught me how to drive.

261
00:17:27,722 --> 00:17:32,388
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm playing Star Wars, I can't fly a space shuttle.

262
00:17:32,408 --> 00:17:35,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing DDR doesn't teach me how to dance.

263
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:40,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Playing Karaoke Revolution doesn't make me any better at singing.

264
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:42,681
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, maybe a little bit, but not necessarily.

265
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:44,483
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the whole point.

266
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:47,084
[SPEAKER_03]: Games do not teach you much.

267
00:17:47,224 --> 00:17:51,406
[SPEAKER_03]: They help you improve hand-eye coordination, but you don't really learn much from them.

268
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:56,389
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to sue the makers of Monopoly because I got a bad real estate deal.

269
00:17:56,989 --> 00:17:58,150
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's because of Monopoly.

270
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,852
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sue Parker Brothers for the game of life.

271
00:18:01,612 --> 00:18:03,033
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you suck at it.

272
00:18:03,273 --> 00:18:05,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not married and have six children.

273
00:18:06,034 --> 00:18:07,695
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't start my life with $20,000.

274
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:18,473
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna sue the game of life for not allowing me to have two blue pegs in the front of the car, per the instruction manual.

275
00:18:18,493 --> 00:18:22,475
[SPEAKER_03]: And I get called on that too, and that makes me upset.

276
00:18:34,568 --> 00:18:38,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, the Game of Life came out a long time ago when that was, like, not hot.

277
00:18:38,713 --> 00:18:39,875
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not okay!

278
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,278
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because it's old doesn't make it right.

279
00:18:42,798 --> 00:18:44,520
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm just, I'm serious, I'm not being serious here.

280
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,085
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta play by Monopoly rules, you know, where you make up your own rules.

281
00:18:48,385 --> 00:18:52,310
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm being a little silly here, but honestly, if we can sue the video game, why can't I sue...

282
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,008
[SPEAKER_03]: Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater.

283
00:18:56,268 --> 00:18:59,831
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I play the game does not mean I can survive in Vietnam.

284
00:19:00,151 --> 00:19:01,652
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, it does not work that way.

285
00:19:01,672 --> 00:19:02,873
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in Vietnam, it's in Russia.

286
00:19:02,913 --> 00:19:04,955
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever, it's a jungle, they're all the same.

287
00:19:04,975 --> 00:19:08,038
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you sometimes dine on a tree frog?

288
00:19:08,218 --> 00:19:10,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It also does not mean that I can eat snakes.

289
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:11,500
[SPEAKER_01]: Or tree frogs.

290
00:19:12,121 --> 00:19:13,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's move on.

291
00:19:14,343 --> 00:19:14,923
[SPEAKER_01]: Or alligators.

292
00:19:15,083 --> 00:19:19,587
[SPEAKER_02]: What a lovely way to follow this up, since DarkSakura is talking about, you know, parents...

293
00:19:20,313 --> 00:19:21,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Be responsible for your kids.

294
00:19:22,074 --> 00:19:25,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Here is a segment for us to give back to the community.

295
00:19:26,036 --> 00:19:28,618
[SPEAKER_02]: And DarkSakura is going to let you know how to better your life.

296
00:19:28,978 --> 00:19:31,840
[SPEAKER_02]: We call this segment DarkSakura's Advice Column.

297
00:19:33,661 --> 00:19:36,242
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are you going to be giving us advice on tonight, DarkSakura?

298
00:19:36,282 --> 00:19:39,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's advice is how to escape if trapped in a lion cage.

299
00:19:39,944 --> 00:19:40,645
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is good.

300
00:19:41,345 --> 00:19:42,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, do not run.

301
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:45,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, where would you run to?

302
00:19:45,887 --> 00:19:46,488
[SPEAKER_02]: You're in a cage.

303
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:47,308
[SPEAKER_02]: Lion cage is a big...

304
00:19:50,196 --> 00:19:51,657
[SPEAKER_01]: 2.

305
00:19:50,296 --> 00:19:51,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch for signs of an attack.

306
00:19:52,117 --> 00:19:58,018
[SPEAKER_01]: A low staccato growl combined with eye contact and a lashing tail usually indicate when an attack is likely.

307
00:19:59,279 --> 00:19:58,018
3.

308
00:19:59,459 --> 00:20:00,939
[SPEAKER_01]: Find a defensive tool.

309
00:20:01,519 --> 00:20:07,161
[SPEAKER_01]: Moving very slowly, picking up anything within reach, a water bowl, bench, or anything else that may be used to fend off a charge.

310
00:20:07,981 --> 00:20:07,161
4.

311
00:20:08,141 --> 00:20:08,981
[SPEAKER_01]: Back away slowly.

312
00:20:10,741 --> 00:20:08,981
5.

313
00:20:11,242 --> 00:20:12,602
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch for mock charges.

314
00:20:13,146 --> 00:20:16,007
[SPEAKER_01]: A lion may make several mock charges before actually attacking.

315
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:17,728
[SPEAKER_01]: It will run forward, then stop.

316
00:20:18,889 --> 00:20:22,310
[SPEAKER_01]: Mock charging shows that a real attack is imminent.

317
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:22,310
6.

318
00:20:22,671 --> 00:20:22,951
[SPEAKER_01]: Yell.

319
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:25,132
[SPEAKER_01]: Yell as loudly as you can.

320
00:20:25,612 --> 00:20:26,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Lions are sensitive to noise.

321
00:20:26,933 --> 00:20:30,574
[SPEAKER_01]: Yelling may discourage further charges.

322
00:20:30,594 --> 00:20:30,574
7.

323
00:20:30,795 --> 00:20:31,775
[SPEAKER_01]: Fend off the attack.

324
00:20:32,235 --> 00:20:34,816
[SPEAKER_01]: Push its paws and head away from you with a nearby object.

325
00:20:35,537 --> 00:20:34,816
8.

326
00:20:35,957 --> 00:20:37,838
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep screaming as loudly as possible.

327
00:20:39,847 --> 00:20:40,867
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what my thing is?

328
00:20:41,548 --> 00:20:42,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't fucking get caught in the cage.

329
00:20:45,929 --> 00:20:50,351
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I played the Lion King game does not mean I can survive a lion attack.

330
00:20:50,391 --> 00:20:57,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because I played Zookeeper does not mean I can... Moving on.

331
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:01,236
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we definitely need to get to a different topic.

332
00:21:02,036 --> 00:21:05,217
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's talk about another industry that ruins people's lives.

333
00:21:05,257 --> 00:21:06,958
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's talk about Hollywood for a minute here.

334
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:08,348
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.

335
00:21:34,395 --> 00:21:41,258
[SPEAKER_02]: And when asked if the WWE wrestler played a creature, The Rock responded, no, I'm the one.

336
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:44,440
[SPEAKER_03]: No, Jet Li's the one.

337
00:21:45,781 --> 00:21:47,341
[SPEAKER_01]: No, Keanu Reeves is the one.

338
00:21:47,542 --> 00:21:48,422
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm confused.

339
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:50,343
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many ones.

340
00:21:51,158 --> 00:21:52,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't he be the, like, 11?

341
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:53,599
[SPEAKER_01]: Then he's 2.

342
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:54,459
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the 2.

343
00:21:54,939 --> 00:22:12,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, who knows if he is the main guy or not, because supposedly some sites are saying that he's playing this character that says Sarge, and The Rock was quoted earlier by Empire Online by saying, Without giving the movie away, I play the ultimate blank.

344
00:22:12,503 --> 00:22:14,363
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be great, but you don't know I'm blank.

345
00:22:15,404 --> 00:22:16,604
[SPEAKER_02]: The blank part's being censored.

346
00:22:17,031 --> 00:22:29,195
[SPEAKER_02]: So who knows what the hell he's doing in this movie, but he's involved with the Doom movie, and it'll be interesting to see if that movie is decent, like the game, or total crap, like Alone in the Dark.

347
00:22:29,935 --> 00:22:32,136
[SPEAKER_03]: Is Ewan Bull attached to this movie?

348
00:22:32,176 --> 00:22:33,656
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not think he's directing it.

349
00:22:33,716 --> 00:22:34,456
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, thank God.

350
00:22:34,476 --> 00:22:35,096
[SPEAKER_02]: There is hope.

351
00:22:35,136 --> 00:22:36,317
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's one point to it.

352
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:42,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man, that guy does not need... I just got Alone in the Dark the other day.

353
00:22:42,221 --> 00:22:43,802
[SPEAKER_03]: I got my screening copy from work.

354
00:22:44,243 --> 00:22:47,746
[SPEAKER_03]: I still have yet to watch it because my friend is borrowing it this weekend to see how bad it is.

355
00:22:48,766 --> 00:22:51,449
[SPEAKER_03]: I will come back and give my full review on that later on.

356
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:55,933
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm scared because... Oh man, it's just bad.

357
00:22:56,353 --> 00:22:57,434
[SPEAKER_03]: But honestly, The Rock...

358
00:22:58,442 --> 00:23:03,666
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's going to be pretty good because he was pretty funny in Be Cool, at least from the trailers I've seen.

359
00:23:03,987 --> 00:23:05,068
[SPEAKER_03]: He's pretty versatile.

360
00:23:05,648 --> 00:23:07,610
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to go in the acting career, it looks like.

361
00:23:08,110 --> 00:23:09,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And I could see him as like an action star.

362
00:23:09,732 --> 00:23:11,173
[SPEAKER_03]: He was good in the rundown, so...

363
00:23:12,553 --> 00:23:15,535
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be willing to give it to him, other than Vin Diesel.

364
00:23:15,755 --> 00:23:19,798
[SPEAKER_02]: He wants to fill Schwarzenegger's shoes so very badly.

365
00:23:19,938 --> 00:23:21,999
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as he never runs for governor.

366
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:31,786
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, actually, if you've ever seen the rundown, there was sort of a passing the torch in that movie where Arnold had a cameo and basically, I don't know, I didn't remember.

367
00:23:31,806 --> 00:23:35,248
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never actually seen the rundown, but it looked good.

368
00:23:36,108 --> 00:23:39,451
[SPEAKER_03]: And my dad said it was awesome.

369
00:23:39,491 --> 00:23:39,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you know...

370
00:23:40,649 --> 00:23:44,374
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rock is related to Rikishi, and both are related to the late Yokozuna.

371
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:46,557
[SPEAKER_02]: I did not know that.

372
00:23:46,797 --> 00:23:47,157
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you do.

373
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,900
[SPEAKER_03]: You know who would be a better role, though, for Doom?

374
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,201
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulk Hogan.

375
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,164
[SPEAKER_01]: He needs to do some things.

376
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:53,359
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulk Hogan's man.

377
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,660
[SPEAKER_03]: Give Hulk Hogan a movie, please.

378
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,841
[SPEAKER_03]: Hulk Hogan needs work.

379
00:23:58,201 --> 00:24:00,902
[SPEAKER_03]: He needs work more than, you know... His daughter does need work.

380
00:24:01,283 --> 00:24:02,343
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, like Mr. Nanny.

381
00:24:02,443 --> 00:24:04,344
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, Hulk Hogan's going to be in a reality show.

382
00:24:04,744 --> 00:24:05,224
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard this.

383
00:24:05,524 --> 00:24:06,005
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Lord.

384
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:13,948
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be following him around, him and his daughter, and it's going to be like life as a celebrity or after being celebrity.

385
00:24:14,768 --> 00:24:15,729
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to be coming on TV.

386
00:24:15,809 --> 00:24:16,929
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just glad he retired from wrestling.

387
00:24:16,949 --> 00:24:18,570
[SPEAKER_03]: But Hulk Hogan, he needs more work.

388
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:40,734
[SPEAKER_03]: because god damn it he's funny you can put him in like something ridiculous like Suburban Commando and you know that movie is so bad but still you can watch it and enjoy it that's the whole point it's fun it doesn't have to be good to be fun Mr. Nanny fun movies people are losing it they want to concentrate on whether a movie is good or bad just be fun fun movie

389
00:24:42,506 --> 00:24:44,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's move on to another story here.

390
00:24:45,130 --> 00:24:48,855
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the biggest, duh, not a surprise of the year.

391
00:24:49,656 --> 00:24:54,843
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo DS is getting brand new colors in Japan.

392
00:24:55,444 --> 00:24:56,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, right now, but

393
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,710
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only a matter of time, kids, as far as I'm concerned.

394
00:25:00,271 --> 00:25:01,911
[SPEAKER_02]: What colors are going to be happening?

395
00:25:02,432 --> 00:25:07,214
[SPEAKER_02]: Graphite Black, Pure White are going to hit the streets on March 24th.

396
00:25:07,614 --> 00:25:13,737
[SPEAKER_02]: And on April 21st, the DS will come out in Turquoise Blue and Candy Pink.

397
00:25:15,418 --> 00:25:16,599
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Graphite Black one.

398
00:25:16,999 --> 00:25:18,400
[SPEAKER_02]: No price increase for this.

399
00:25:20,311 --> 00:25:24,894
[SPEAKER_02]: It costs the same as the standard colored DS, but Nintendo always does this.

400
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:25,775
[SPEAKER_02]: This is no surprise.

401
00:25:26,135 --> 00:25:28,597
[SPEAKER_03]: How many times can you buy the Game Boy before you get tired?

402
00:25:28,937 --> 00:25:30,058
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I need to know.

403
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:31,059
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what, folks?

404
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:36,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Also coming out soon, because the DS is not the replacement for the Game Boy, the Game Boy Advance 2.

405
00:25:36,503 --> 00:25:38,284
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right, they're working on Game Boy Advance 2.

406
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:40,966
[SPEAKER_03]: The DS is its own little entity.

407
00:25:41,417 --> 00:25:44,139
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got our thing down there for the great game shooter.

408
00:25:44,339 --> 00:25:50,483
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's great, though, is you have the DS with hardly any games, and now when the Game Boy Advance 2 comes out, there won't be any games.

409
00:25:50,543 --> 00:25:54,766
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to die off like the freaking, I don't know, Jaguar.

410
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:58,949
[SPEAKER_02]: Out of curiosity, is anyone here going to pick up a PSP on our launch day?

411
00:25:59,009 --> 00:25:59,809
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got one reserved.

412
00:26:00,190 --> 00:26:00,550
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.

413
00:26:00,690 --> 00:26:01,450
[SPEAKER_01]: The great game launcher.

414
00:26:01,671 --> 00:26:02,871
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on the fence.

415
00:26:02,931 --> 00:26:07,534
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of depends, because I have things going on in my personal life I have to pay for, and that's quite a bit of an investment.

416
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:10,196
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I have extra money, I want to get one.

417
00:26:10,216 --> 00:26:11,137
[SPEAKER_03]: Or you own an Atari Lynx.

418
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:24,912
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't totally about video games, but then I think about, I go around at work, and I constantly see people that should be working playing on Yahoo Games.

419
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:30,533
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of makes me think that Yahoo Games kind of has a pretty decent impact on the gaming world.

420
00:26:30,613 --> 00:26:32,253
[SPEAKER_02]: Or the people around you are slackers.

421
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,033
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that too.

422
00:26:33,373 --> 00:26:34,793
[SPEAKER_02]: But I thought this was worth mentioning.

423
00:26:35,173 --> 00:26:40,594
[SPEAKER_02]: Yahoo is actually going to be breaking into the mobile game area now.

424
00:26:40,694 --> 00:26:44,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Yahoo announced that it has launched its own game development studio because it acquired...

425
00:26:45,245 --> 00:26:52,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Stadium Inc., another development studio, and they're going to have this new studio, Yahoo Games Studio.

426
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:56,675
[SPEAKER_02]: It already has, of course, the free multiplayer card and board games they have on their site.

427
00:26:57,456 --> 00:27:04,182
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're going to be working on mobile phone games, so this should be interesting, another way to waste your time.

428
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,524
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to admit, Yahoo has some pretty addicting games on it.

429
00:27:06,544 --> 00:27:10,087
[SPEAKER_03]: They have good games, but you've got to admit, also, mobile phone games are way overpriced.

430
00:27:10,988 --> 00:27:11,889
[SPEAKER_03]: Way overpriced.

431
00:27:11,949 --> 00:27:12,149
[SPEAKER_02]: True.

432
00:27:13,075 --> 00:27:16,096
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting to see the mobile game world kind of expanding.

433
00:27:16,576 --> 00:27:19,357
[SPEAKER_02]: And not just the N-Gage, but, you know.

434
00:27:19,857 --> 00:27:21,758
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're still going with the N-Gage.

435
00:27:22,338 --> 00:27:23,458
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't let that go.

436
00:27:23,578 --> 00:27:25,179
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the press release.

437
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:27,139
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still working on the N-Gage.

438
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:29,140
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, we're not done with the N-Gage yet.

439
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:30,320
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, yes you are.

440
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:31,621
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all past it.

441
00:27:31,821 --> 00:27:33,101
[SPEAKER_02]: Why can't you get past it?

442
00:27:34,521 --> 00:27:38,343
[SPEAKER_02]: Every serious gamer has said bye-bye to the N-Gage a long time ago.

443
00:27:39,163 --> 00:27:39,703
[SPEAKER_02]: Let it go.

444
00:27:41,432 --> 00:27:43,073
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a time where they need to learn to let go.

445
00:27:44,214 --> 00:27:46,656
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see the Engage tent again this year.

446
00:27:49,458 --> 00:28:09,493
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our favorite companies, Square Enix, Square Enix, however you want to say it, or as we say it, Squeenix, they have, the president, Yoichi Wada, said an interesting quote, I think that over half our income and profit will be based on network content, including games.

447
00:28:10,083 --> 00:28:13,946
[SPEAKER_02]: I-Speed Internet is becoming like cable where everyone has it so why not embrace the future?

448
00:28:33,755 --> 00:28:34,736
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII, Kingdom Hearts 2, Ergot

449
00:28:54,383 --> 00:29:00,366
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and this one's for Loki, because I saw him post about this game on his live journal.

450
00:29:17,859 --> 00:29:20,882
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo is letting the dogs out on April 21st Puppy Time

451
00:29:41,069 --> 00:29:42,250
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

452
00:30:05,239 --> 00:30:06,579
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know why I'd want this.

453
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:10,281
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably because I'm just sad that there's no other games for the DS.

454
00:30:10,321 --> 00:30:11,761
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me tell you what you can do with this.

455
00:30:11,981 --> 00:30:13,382
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use the touchscreen pad.

456
00:30:13,422 --> 00:30:16,223
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call out the puppy's name by yelling in the microphone.

457
00:30:16,543 --> 00:30:18,163
[SPEAKER_02]: You can yell, stay, sit.

458
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:22,365
[SPEAKER_02]: There's over 150 items that you can use to entertain the dogs with.

459
00:30:24,766 --> 00:30:25,386
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting, huh?

460
00:30:27,066 --> 00:30:27,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds cool.

461
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,788
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to get it because my fiance won't let me have a dog because she's...

462
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,961
[SPEAKER_03]: I also have this game.

463
00:31:01,963 --> 00:31:07,327
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, the virtual dogs and everything will work even when the DS is in sleep mode.

464
00:31:07,887 --> 00:31:08,627
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of cool.

465
00:31:11,289 --> 00:31:11,629
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

466
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,792
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to do it for tonight's podcast, everybody.

Puppy.

471

477
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:33,290
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's my final thought.

478
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:34,131

481
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:43,095
[SPEAKER_03]: See Appleseed if it's nearby in one of your theaters because it's an awesome movie.

482
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,395
[SPEAKER_02]: And kick an Ultra Kade machine.

483
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:45,596
