521	3644	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of March 7th, 2005.
4224	15553	And now, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your internet radio home for discussion on rhythm and music gaming, and all the news on video games that don't suck.
15993	20357	And now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
21277	25060	Hello everybody, welcome back to our podcast.
25120	26762	Thanks so much for subscribing.
27495	32359	and support in our little talk program we got here dedicated to video games that don't suck.
32960	51435	You know, we're just a sideshow to the website www.orangeloungeradio.com where we actually have a 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week station where we play a lot of video game music, especially stuff from Konami's Beatmania series, or Bomani series, I should say, as well as DDR, etc., etc.
51455	52436	A lot of good stuff on there.
52736	53877	And then other video game stuff, too.
53917	54998	It's not just limited to that.
55058	55719	So check that out.
56565	58506	and then our live programs we do throughout the week.
59446	60246	My name is Rob Roberts.
60266	61227	You might know me as Sky.
61307	63147	Joining me as always is my awesome co-host.
63207	65608	Say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
66048	66469	Hi.
67229	67669	How are you?
69170	71190	I have diseased lungs.
71910	78933	You've kind of got the 80-year-old grandma thing going on right now because of your infection.
79793	82274	I sound like a broken-necked ghost.
82614	83495	Well, I hope you feel better.
83755	84195	Thank you.
84415	84735	All right.
85539	86941	And Loki is here as well.
87201	87761	Say hello, Loki.
87901	88702	Yes, I am.
89063	91525	Eating my five pounds of gummy bears.
92586	93527	Gummy bears.
94808	95969	Stronger than the average bear.
96069	97851	No, these things are like crack.
98071	101554	I mean, honestly, I gotta put them down, because otherwise I will feel sick.
102615	107079	And because, for some reason, your body does not like five pounds of gelatin inside of it.
107099	109081	Throwing up gummy is no fun, either.
109862	110242	So I've heard.
111027	112729	Anyway, let's get into it.
113629	117653	We're going to get to some gaming news, but let's talk about what's going on in our gaming world lately.
117733	119354	DarkSakura, what kind of games have you been playing this week?
120075	124779	Tekken 5, Tekken 5, Tekken 5, and Final Fantasy XI.
125500	126500	How's Tekken 5 going?
127101	130504	It's awesome, but Mishima Jinpachi is a bastard.
131305	135008	So, really quickly, tell me the best thing about Tekken 5 and the worst thing about Tekken 5.
135548	137230	Well, it's always been Jin.
138150	138691	The worst thing?
139315	142538	Jinpachi And his stupid gut fireball And then Julia is like sucky to dodge it
162935	164136	Devil Jin has his old moves.
185962	186742	I'm very happy.
187082	191723	Have you played a lot of the arcade mode where you earn the points so you can customize your character?
192063	196324	That's what we've been doing because we've got Eddie Gordo, we have Panda.
198384	205285	Do you like though how they have, have you played a lot of one player arcade because it has like the made up names that you play against and some of them are really funny.
205545	207786	I don't think we did that, no we just were doing story mode.
207866	214567	Check it out because if you play one player arcade you get to play against like fake personalities like it's a real arcade, it's really funny some of the names, pretty cool.
215428	218410	I do like seeing the Roger Jr.
218830	220051	Mokujin conversation.
220091	220591	That was funny.
221611	222392	Oh, Mokujin.
222832	223512	I miss that guy.
223653	224093	He was cool.
224953	225373	He's in it.
225554	225774	Is he?
226434	227755	Oh, I just haven't unlocked him yet.
227835	229015	I've only unlocked a couple characters.
229075	230696	I've been playing a lot of Tekken 5 this week as well.
230716	232137	He talks in woodblock language.
233698	235779	You ever hear woodblocks like in Marching Band?
236348	236588	Yeah.
237089	237749	That's what he sounds like.
237930	238490	Oh, that's funny.
238971	241333	It's cool because in Tekken they all have their native languages.
241373	244056	That's funny that Mokujin has a... And, of course, Roger Jr.
244456	246979	is hanging out in Mommy's pouch speaking kangaroo.
248761	249902	What does kangaroo sound like?
249962	250722	Care to demonstrate?
251083	251203	No.
251463	251703	Alright.
253324	256506	So, Loki, what have you been up to this week in the game world?
256846	265550	I've been playing Final Fantasy XI, and I've been playing, well, I tried playing some Neo Contra, but for some reason it wasn't working.
266331	271273	And then I played some, actually, some arcade stuff.
271333	278157	I played Alien vs. Predator all the way through, and I also played the guy game again.
279360	281921	You're just determined to see as many boobs as possible, aren't you?
282561	283441	Ran a porn!
285101	287402	It's not about the fact that there's boobs in it.
287442	288682	That's not really the point.
289102	291783	It's a fun party game, and the trivia is a lot of fun.
291823	293823	It's like Trivial Pursuit with boobs.
294184	295744	Mario Party is a fun party game.
296184	297924	The guy game is boobs.
297944	308107	It's a good trivia game, honestly, because there hasn't been a good You Don't Know Jack game for the home console system in a while, so this will have to do.
309468	311595	Besides it has boobies in it.
311996	312959	That's what I was looking for.
313080	313401	Thank you.
315095	319759	As for me, this week I've been playing, well, Tekken 5 as well, but Jamie already mentioned that.
319799	323561	So I will mention I've been playing a lot of Final Fantasy Dawn of Souls, specifically Final Fantasy 2.
324762	327244	I've been trying to just get further along in that game.
327624	335089	I decided I was going to force myself to take a break from Final Fantasy 11 this week because, you know, I'm just, I'm ODing on it, honestly, and it's getting stupid.
335510	337591	So I need to take a minute to play some other games.
337971	342815	So Final Fantasy 2, which, yeah, I go from one Final Fantasy to another, I know, big
343215	343855	Big wow, right?
343875	344636	But I figure, you know what?
344696	346977	I spent the money on Dawn of Souls.
347077	349779	I ought to, you know, check it out and play it a little more.
349879	355682	So, because I kind of gave up on Final Fantasy 1 because I was like, I already know this from the NES.
355702	356763	I already know this story.
356783	358804	You know, the graphics, okay, I'm done with that now.
359044	361085	But Final Fantasy 2, it's still very fresh to me.
361485	366708	I never really got into it, even when it was translated and out in ROM form on the internet years ago.
367009	367869	I never really got into it.
367909	369910	So now I'm kind of getting into it and it's kind of cool.
371071	371171	So,
372373	376636	I also forgot to mention in the guy game, I got one point at the end of the game.
376796	385441	I got zero points because I bet on the wrong girl to win the guy challenge, I guess is what it was.
386642	389603	Where basically they have to do something stupid topless or whatever.
390024	390684	So I got it wrong.
391024	397968	So they reward you with some crew member, some big fat hairy guy that's doing like sultry stuff and I thought that was very hilarious.
398569	398949	Whatever.
400330	400670	Whatever.
401863	406034	Alright, let's get into some video game news, some stuff that's actually going on out there this week.
407105	409706	Big news, Metal Gear Solid 4 is confirmed.
409746	410907	It is going to be happening.
411167	416509	There was a press event in Berlin to celebrate the release of Metal Gear Solid 3 Snake Eater in Europe.
417270	419951	The next game in the Metal Gear Solid series was confirmed.
421432	429375	Although Hideo Kojima always said that Metal Gear was kind of going to be a trilogy, of course these games sell very well and they're going to live on.
430136	432977	It's just that Hideo Kojima is going to step aside in this one.
433733	435635	He's just going to be executive producer.
436015	440459	This time, Kenichiro Imezumi is going to be taking over as the title's producer.
440559	443241	So we can expect some new things to come out of Metal Gear.
444162	445203	You're a Metal Gear fan, right?
446164	448265	So what do you think about Hideo Kojima stepping aside?
448285	451268	Do you think it's going to be a fresh look for the series?
451308	453630	He's still going to have control over the basic elements.
453650	455612	He's not going to let anything go outside his vision.
455632	460316	As long as he's executive producer, I don't feel like producing your stupid ideas.
462262	463883	I think things will be okay.
463983	466485	It's kind of not a big surprise.
466705	468746	We were talking about this on Outside the Box on Thursday night.
471089	475952	Kojima, he's been threatening to do it for a while, so it's not a big surprise.
476152	479774	Well, a perfect example would be the Silent Hill series.
480014	493381	I don't remember the original creator of it, but then you have Akira Yamaoka stepping up to actually write the series 3 and 4, whereas someone else is doing 1 and 2, and he was just doing the music for it.
493861	495362	So it could be a good thing.
495522	496963	I think it is a good thing, actually, because...
498559	511668	He's probably run out of, not really run out of ideas, but, you know, having some, you know, actual, someone else helping to create this, it'll be a little bit better because, you know, some fresh new ideas can come from it.
511988	521054	And, obviously, since he's still the executive producer of it, you know, it's not going to just turn into something awful like that you might see in, I don't know, a video game movie.
523375	524756	Alright, so we'll see what happens with that.
524776	526997	I'm looking forward to seeing more stuff on Metal Gear Solid 4.
529045	533286	I just think it needs to have Dave Snake again.
534206	541168	I always call Solid Snake Dave Snake if you ever played through the first Metal Gear Solid.
542108	545509	Metal Gear Solid are games I've watched and not played a whole lot.
545549	546869	I've played them a little bit, but not a whole lot.
547009	548990	Metal Gear Solid 3 was all about Big Boss.
549870	552111	Nothing will trump the original Metal Gear for me.
552231	553651	The truck have started to move.
555305	557866	Now, did they mention which console this is going to come out?
557946	559007	Next Gen, probably?
560627	561828	I believe it was Next Gen.
562068	562308	Okay.
563688	564089	I don't remember.
564269	566509	I don't have the story in front of me anymore, but I think it was Next Gen.
567210	568030	If I'm wrong, I'm wrong.
569271	574453	If you ever want to give feedback, by the way, if you want to yell at us for being wrong or whatever, you just want to say, hello, hi, how you doing?
574553	578094	Our email address, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaunchradio.com.
578114	580475	We'd love to answer some viewer mail in the podcast.
581065	584147	We haven't gotten anything really appropriate for that yet, so something to think about.
584187	595075	If you have a question you'd like us to address on the podcast, send it over to go at orangelaunchradio.com ESRB, the Entertainment Software Rating Board, they have introduced a brand new rating.
595115	597377	You know how games are rated, very similar to movies.
597777	608665	They have ratings such as Childhood, EC, Everyone, E, Teen, T, Mature, M, Very Rare, Adults Only, but you probably see that in the guy game.
609884	611606	Okay, but now they've got a brand new rating.
611626	612706	They just unveiled a new rating.
612766	614648	It's called E10+.
616009	624156	It's going to categorize those games that may not be necessarily family friendly, but they're not quite really worthy of a T rating as well.
624717	637087	So Donkey Kong Jungle Beat would be an example of a game that would get like an E10 plus rating because it's kind of not really for everybody per se, but it's not really a game that needs to be teen rated either.
637347	638188	So thoughts on that?
639460	640781	is called They Should Rate It.
641361	642522	Parents, do your research.
644804	646625	Parents, do your job.
647365	649027	Do you think the rating system does its job?
650468	657953	The only good that comes of it is giving an overall indicator so that if a parent actually feels like doing their job, they can look at the game and get an idea.
658213	666098	So where's the rating that's, um, if you're under 17 and you buy this, we're going to, um, sue the pants off you.
666378	668380	Or, or like, um,
669537	671619	This game may cause you to go murder someone.
694304	694744	Retarded idea.
694764	694865	Why?
694905	696506	It's just a way for them to make money.
696526	697326	You know, um... First of all...
720333	721893	It's not necessarily going to be the store's fault.
721953	729435	Having gone into my fiancé's store plenty of times, I see where someone will pick up a game, walk around the store with it, and put it on the bottom shelf.
730895	735936	You know, there shouldn't be any reason that the store should be held accountable for some other poor idiots, you know.
737037	738517	Yeah, this is retarded.
739137	742918	For example, Sir, I cannot reach that game on the high shelf.
742978	744298	Can you please get it down for me?
744598	745739	Oh, there you go, got the game.
746499	747559	That doesn't stop anyone.
747970	749730	It's discrimination against short people.
750290	752411	It's midget discrimination.
752511	753291	Poor midgets.
754411	757232	Is no one thinking of the midget gamer?
758532	760433	Midgets want Grand Theft Auto 2.
760973	761613	What the hell?
762433	765414	What does it matter that they can reach the game?
765834	769914	The person that's behind the counter shouldn't be selling the mature game to them anyways.
770475	771075	What's it matter?
771195	773535	The parents shouldn't be giving the kids the money to buy the game.
773555	775796	When I was in 6th grade, I was just under 5 feet.
776656	777616	And I could reach up
778573	779414	and grab something.
780774	781695	This is retarded.
782255	783236	How old is this senator?
784077	784497	No idea.
784877	795304	To be honest here, okay, violent games, I don't even see how these can be, you know, even close to being equal to like violent movies or violent TV.
796184	797845	It's just completely like two different things.
797905	801187	It'd be like depicting a piece of art with blood in it.
801368	802288	Oh my god.
803149	805070	It's just really sad.
806010	827224	Well, it doesn't stop there, you guys, because also coming out on the Newswire this week, three Washington State representatives, Jim McCune, Jim McDermott, and Mary Lou Dickerson, they co-authored a bill that will hold game companies responsible if a minor commits a violent act that is seemingly inspired by a video game they played.
827644	829085	That's even more stupid.
829566	831507	That's, yeah, that's not fair.
831627	832668	That's just straight up not fair.
832688	833048	That's called...
833919	839144	They're trying to find a scapegoat because parents don't want to take any responsibility for what their children do.
839504	844149	The reason why their children are acting this way is because it's their own damn fault.
844829	850274	And I would freaking pay to have a press conference to announce to all these parents that they're idiots.
850835	853477	Well, you got the podcast.
853517	857121	Parents of America, do your goddamn job.
858199	862203	If your child is a little hellion, spank them!
862423	865305	You know what's wrong with this whole United States?
865766	869209	Is the goddamn balls have left the judicial system.
869729	876735	Where are the judges out there that go when these people go, Yeah, my kid killed this kid and he learned it in Grand Theft Auto.
877115	879217	Maybe he learned it because you're a bad parent.
879357	882420	I'll tell you what, she's on TV every night at 7 o'clock.
882500	883601	Judge Judy, thank you.
884601	884962	You know...
886790	887470	Watch the news.
887710	888671	Watch the fucking news.
889531	890971	Watch fucking CNN.
891611	893632	And so-and-so killed so-and-so.
893912	895573	And kids thinking, huh.
897153	898494	I have violent tendencies.
898574	899534	I want to be on the news.
901414	902475	It's just ridiculous.
903095	903615	You know what?
903715	911157	Next thing you're going to have Al-Qaeda suing Microsoft because they learned to fly airplanes in the buildings from Microsoft Flight Simulator.
912198	913498	It's all Microsoft's fault.
914156	916078	It's always Microsoft's fault, but that's another story
933516	956271	60 Minutes was going to be airing a segment and it has to do with the battle between the families of a slain Alabama police officer I'm sorry, actually multiple Alabama police officers and the makers and the sellers of the Grand Theft Auto franchise because there was a lawsuit that was sparked by the deaths of three Alabama police officers who were killed by a teen who said he was inspired by Grand Theft Auto
957574	958635	Talk about scapegoat.
958675	961037	The game made me do it, Mommy!
961057	965059	That's because Mommy facilitated him having the game.
965140	970363	There were plenty of times I wanted games, and my mama wouldn't buy them for me.
970744	971564	Here's the interesting thing.
972425	977989	The arrest of Devin Moore, who is allegedly responsible for the crime, 18 years old.
980131	980731	He's hangable.
984922	988203	More allegedly said, life's like a video game.
988503	989744	You've gotta die sometime.
991084	991924	No, I'm sorry.
992184	994605	Games like Grand Theft Auto do not teach you how to kill.
994665	997105	Games like Area 51 teach you how to kill.
997425	1002567	That gives you fucking, you know, hand-eye coordination and you get better aim playing some games like that.
1003127	1007888	That's the type of games that'll teach you how to kill is a game like Time Crisis or a gun game like that.
1008228	1010869	Grand Theft Auto, I push a button and it fires a gun.
1011661	1012422	That David Chappelle skit
1023484	1024765	Hey, Ridge Racer taught me how to drive.
1047722	1052388	If I'm playing Star Wars, I can't fly a space shuttle.
1052408	1055652	Playing DDR doesn't teach me how to dance.
1057094	1060298	Playing Karaoke Revolution doesn't make me any better at singing.
1060458	1062681	Well, maybe a little bit, but not necessarily.
1063602	1064483	This is the whole point.
1064583	1067084	Games do not teach you much.
1067224	1071406	They help you improve hand-eye coordination, but you don't really learn much from them.
1071707	1076389	I'm going to sue the makers of Monopoly because I got a bad real estate deal.
1076989	1078150	And it's because of Monopoly.
1078450	1080852	I'm going to sue Parker Brothers for the game of life.
1081612	1083033	Because you suck at it.
1083273	1085314	I'm not married and have six children.
1086034	1087695	And I didn't start my life with $20,000.
1090848	1098473	I'm gonna sue the game of life for not allowing me to have two blue pegs in the front of the car, per the instruction manual.
1098493	1102475	And I get called on that too, and that makes me upset.
1114568	1118393	Dude, the Game of Life came out a long time ago when that was, like, not hot.
1118713	1119875	It's not okay!
1120515	1122278	Just because it's old doesn't make it right.
1122798	1124520	Okay, I'm just, I'm serious, I'm not being serious here.
1124560	1128085	You gotta play by Monopoly rules, you know, where you make up your own rules.
1128385	1132310	I'm being a little silly here, but honestly, if we can sue the video game, why can't I sue...
1133866	1136008	Metal Gear Solid 3, Snake Eater.
1136268	1139831	Just because I play the game does not mean I can survive in Vietnam.
1140151	1141652	Okay, it does not work that way.
1141672	1142873	It's not in Vietnam, it's in Russia.
1142913	1144955	Whatever, it's a jungle, they're all the same.
1144975	1148038	Do you sometimes dine on a tree frog?
1148218	1150319	It also does not mean that I can eat snakes.
1150960	1151500	Or tree frogs.
1152121	1153522	Anyway, let's move on.
1154343	1154923	Or alligators.
1155083	1159587	What a lovely way to follow this up, since DarkSakura is talking about, you know, parents...
1160313	1161634	Be responsible for your kids.
1162074	1165716	Here is a segment for us to give back to the community.
1166036	1168618	And DarkSakura is going to let you know how to better your life.
1168978	1171840	We call this segment DarkSakura's Advice Column.
1173661	1176242	And what are you going to be giving us advice on tonight, DarkSakura?
1176282	1179064	Today's advice is how to escape if trapped in a lion cage.
1179944	1180645	Oh, this is good.
1181345	1182946	Number one, do not run.
1184587	1185767	Wait, where would you run to?
1185887	1186488	You're in a cage.
1186508	1187308	Lion cage is a big...
1190196	1191657	2.
1190296	1191657	Watch for signs of an attack.
1192117	1198018	A low staccato growl combined with eye contact and a lashing tail usually indicate when an attack is likely.
1199279	1198018	3.
1199459	1200939	Find a defensive tool.
1201519	1207161	Moving very slowly, picking up anything within reach, a water bowl, bench, or anything else that may be used to fend off a charge.
1207981	1207161	4.
1208141	1208981	Back away slowly.
1210741	1208981	5.
1211242	1212602	Watch for mock charges.
1213146	1216007	A lion may make several mock charges before actually attacking.
1216448	1217728	It will run forward, then stop.
1218889	1222310	Mock charging shows that a real attack is imminent.
1222330	1222310	6.
1222671	1222951	Yell.
1223771	1225132	Yell as loudly as you can.
1225612	1226893	Lions are sensitive to noise.
1226933	1230574	Yelling may discourage further charges.
1230594	1230574	7.
1230795	1231775	Fend off the attack.
1232235	1234816	Push its paws and head away from you with a nearby object.
1235537	1234816	8.
1235957	1237838	Keep screaming as loudly as possible.
1239847	1240867	You know what my thing is?
1241548	1242728	Don't fucking get caught in the cage.
1245929	1250351	Just because I played the Lion King game does not mean I can survive a lion attack.
1250391	1257534	Just because I played Zookeeper does not mean I can... Moving on.
1257734	1261236	I think we definitely need to get to a different topic.
1262036	1265217	So let's talk about another industry that ruins people's lives.
1265257	1266958	Let's talk about Hollywood for a minute here.
1268188	1268348	Oh, shit.
1294395	1301258	And when asked if the WWE wrestler played a creature, The Rock responded, no, I'm the one.
1303279	1304440	No, Jet Li's the one.
1305781	1307341	No, Keanu Reeves is the one.
1307542	1308422	I'm confused.
1309142	1310343	Too many ones.
1311158	1312778	Can't he be the, like, 11?
1313299	1313599	Then he's 2.
1313779	1314459	I'm the 2.
1314939	1332243	Now, who knows if he is the main guy or not, because supposedly some sites are saying that he's playing this character that says Sarge, and The Rock was quoted earlier by Empire Online by saying, Without giving the movie away, I play the ultimate blank.
1332503	1334363	It'll be great, but you don't know I'm blank.
1335404	1336604	The blank part's being censored.
1337031	1349195	So who knows what the hell he's doing in this movie, but he's involved with the Doom movie, and it'll be interesting to see if that movie is decent, like the game, or total crap, like Alone in the Dark.
1349935	1352136	Is Ewan Bull attached to this movie?
1352176	1353656	I do not think he's directing it.
1353716	1354456	Okay, thank God.
1354476	1355096	There is hope.
1355136	1356317	Well, there's one point to it.
1357797	1362161	Oh man, that guy does not need... I just got Alone in the Dark the other day.
1362221	1363802	I got my screening copy from work.
1364243	1367746	I still have yet to watch it because my friend is borrowing it this weekend to see how bad it is.
1368766	1371449	I will come back and give my full review on that later on.
1372029	1375933	I'm scared because... Oh man, it's just bad.
1376353	1377434	But honestly, The Rock...
1378442	1383666	I think he's going to be pretty good because he was pretty funny in Be Cool, at least from the trailers I've seen.
1383987	1385068	He's pretty versatile.
1385648	1387610	He wants to go in the acting career, it looks like.
1388110	1389691	And I could see him as like an action star.
1389732	1391173	He was good in the rundown, so...
1392553	1395535	I'd be willing to give it to him, other than Vin Diesel.
1395755	1399798	He wants to fill Schwarzenegger's shoes so very badly.
1399938	1401999	As long as he never runs for governor.
1402420	1411786	Well, actually, if you've ever seen the rundown, there was sort of a passing the torch in that movie where Arnold had a cameo and basically, I don't know, I didn't remember.
1411806	1415248	I've never actually seen the rundown, but it looked good.
1416108	1419451	And my dad said it was awesome.
1419491	1419891	Did you know...
1420649	1424374	The Rock is related to Rikishi, and both are related to the late Yokozuna.
1425836	1426557	I did not know that.
1426797	1427157	Now you do.
1427177	1428900	You know who would be a better role, though, for Doom?
1429561	1430201	Hulk Hogan.
1431263	1432164	He needs to do some things.
1432639	1433359	Hulk Hogan's man.
1433679	1435660	Give Hulk Hogan a movie, please.
1436000	1437841	Hulk Hogan needs work.
1438201	1440902	He needs work more than, you know... His daughter does need work.
1441283	1442343	Well, like Mr. Nanny.
1442443	1444344	Actually, Hulk Hogan's going to be in a reality show.
1444744	1445224	I heard this.
1445524	1446005	Oh, Lord.
1446045	1453948	It's going to be following him around, him and his daughter, and it's going to be like life as a celebrity or after being celebrity.
1454768	1455729	It's supposed to be coming on TV.
1455809	1456929	I'm just glad he retired from wrestling.
1456949	1458570	But Hulk Hogan, he needs more work.
1459450	1480734	because god damn it he's funny you can put him in like something ridiculous like Suburban Commando and you know that movie is so bad but still you can watch it and enjoy it that's the whole point it's fun it doesn't have to be good to be fun Mr. Nanny fun movies people are losing it they want to concentrate on whether a movie is good or bad just be fun fun movie
1482506	1484990	Alright, let's move on to another story here.
1485130	1488855	This is the biggest, duh, not a surprise of the year.
1489656	1494843	Nintendo DS is getting brand new colors in Japan.
1495444	1496826	Granted, right now, but
1497329	1499710	It's only a matter of time, kids, as far as I'm concerned.
1500271	1501911	What colors are going to be happening?
1502432	1507214	Graphite Black, Pure White are going to hit the streets on March 24th.
1507614	1513737	And on April 21st, the DS will come out in Turquoise Blue and Candy Pink.
1515418	1516599	And the Graphite Black one.
1516999	1518400	No price increase for this.
1520311	1524894	It costs the same as the standard colored DS, but Nintendo always does this.
1524934	1525775	This is no surprise.
1526135	1528597	How many times can you buy the Game Boy before you get tired?
1528937	1530058	That's what I need to know.
1530278	1531059	And guess what, folks?
1531679	1536463	Also coming out soon, because the DS is not the replacement for the Game Boy, the Game Boy Advance 2.
1536503	1538284	That's right, they're working on Game Boy Advance 2.
1539305	1540966	The DS is its own little entity.
1541417	1544139	We've got our thing down there for the great game shooter.
1544339	1550483	So what's great, though, is you have the DS with hardly any games, and now when the Game Boy Advance 2 comes out, there won't be any games.
1550543	1554766	It's just going to die off like the freaking, I don't know, Jaguar.
1555967	1558949	Out of curiosity, is anyone here going to pick up a PSP on our launch day?
1559009	1559809	I've got one reserved.
1560190	1560550	Sounds good.
1560690	1561450	The great game launcher.
1561671	1562871	I'm on the fence.
1562931	1567534	It kind of depends, because I have things going on in my personal life I have to pay for, and that's quite a bit of an investment.
1567615	1570196	So if I have extra money, I want to get one.
1570216	1571137	Or you own an Atari Lynx.
1575270	1584912	This isn't totally about video games, but then I think about, I go around at work, and I constantly see people that should be working playing on Yahoo Games.
1585472	1590533	And so it kind of makes me think that Yahoo Games kind of has a pretty decent impact on the gaming world.
1590613	1592253	Or the people around you are slackers.
1592433	1593033	Well, that too.
1593373	1594793	But I thought this was worth mentioning.
1595173	1600594	Yahoo is actually going to be breaking into the mobile game area now.
1600694	1604735	Yahoo announced that it has launched its own game development studio because it acquired...
1605245	1612411	Stadium Inc., another development studio, and they're going to have this new studio, Yahoo Games Studio.
1612772	1616675	It already has, of course, the free multiplayer card and board games they have on their site.
1617456	1624182	Now they're going to be working on mobile phone games, so this should be interesting, another way to waste your time.
1624222	1626524	You have to admit, Yahoo has some pretty addicting games on it.
1626544	1630087	They have good games, but you've got to admit, also, mobile phone games are way overpriced.
1630988	1631889	Way overpriced.
1631949	1632149	True.
1633075	1636096	But it's interesting to see the mobile game world kind of expanding.
1636576	1639357	And not just the N-Gage, but, you know.
1639857	1641758	Because they're still going with the N-Gage.
1642338	1643458	They won't let that go.
1643578	1645179	I remember the press release.
1645319	1647139	They're still working on the N-Gage.
1647179	1649140	They're like, we're not done with the N-Gage yet.
1649280	1650320	I'm like, yes you are.
1650680	1651621	We're all past it.
1651821	1653101	Why can't you get past it?
1654521	1658343	Every serious gamer has said bye-bye to the N-Gage a long time ago.
1659163	1659703	Let it go.
1661432	1663073	There is a time where they need to learn to let go.
1664214	1666656	I can't wait to see the Engage tent again this year.
1669458	1689493	One of our favorite companies, Square Enix, Square Enix, however you want to say it, or as we say it, Squeenix, they have, the president, Yoichi Wada, said an interesting quote, I think that over half our income and profit will be based on network content, including games.
1690083	1693946	I-Speed Internet is becoming like cable where everyone has it so why not embrace the future?
1713755	1714736	Final Fantasy XII, Kingdom Hearts 2, Ergot
1734383	1740366	All right, one more story for you guys tonight, and this one's for Loki, because I saw him post about this game on his live journal.
1757859	1760882	Nintendo is letting the dogs out on April 21st Puppy Time
1781069	1782250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1805239	1806579	I don't even know why I'd want this.
1807060	1810281	Probably because I'm just sad that there's no other games for the DS.
1810321	1811761	Well, let me tell you what you can do with this.
1811981	1813382	You can use the touchscreen pad.
1813422	1816223	You can call out the puppy's name by yelling in the microphone.
1816543	1818163	You can yell, stay, sit.
1818584	1822365	There's over 150 items that you can use to entertain the dogs with.
1824766	1825386	Interesting, huh?
1827066	1827727	Sounds cool.
1828427	1831788	I'll have to get it because my fiance won't let me have a dog because she's...
1832600	1833961	I also have this game.
1861963	1867327	By the way, the virtual dogs and everything will work even when the DS is in sleep mode.
1867887	1868627	So that's kind of cool.
1871289	1871629	All right.
1872350	1874792	That's going to do it for tonight's podcast, everybody.
1874852	1876653	Thanks a bunch for subscribing to us.
1876753	1877573	We appreciate it.
1877633	1878994	Any last words, DarkSakura?
1880155	1880716	Puppy.
1881736	1882036	Loki?
1883818	1886059	Wow, it's another long podcast.
1886299	1887200	Over 30 minutes.

1889942	1891643	Well, we've just got a lot to say.
1892250	1893290	I guess that's my final thought.
1893331	1894131	We've got big mouths.
1894451	1895431	But thank you for listening to it.
1895692	1899233	Once again, watch Robot Chicken if you haven't yet.
1899593	1903095	See Appleseed if it's nearby in one of your theaters because it's an awesome movie.
1903235	1904395	And kick an Ultra Kade machine.
1904536	1905596	Kick an Ultra Kade machine.
1906316	1907577	Thanks for subscribing, everybody.
