In this corner, say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Jamie Sommers, you

03:25.040 --> 03:26.620
know her better as Dark Sakura.

03:26.620 --> 03:28.420
Now long to free.

03:28.420 --> 03:30.820
Yes, no long butter this week.

03:30.820 --> 03:35.080
Well, um, but I'm mostly better.

03:35.080 --> 03:36.680
Sounds good to me.

03:36.680 --> 03:41.680
And in this corner, saving our sound at the last second here tonight, we are having some

03:41.680 --> 03:44.880
major sound issues just 30 seconds ago.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.480
Say hello to Loki!

03:46.480 --> 03:55.120
Alright, and also joining us tonight, a veteran of our program, a veteran guest, she's been

03:55.120 --> 04:00.620
down in the trenches, and she knows how to butter the host of the show up.

04:00.620 --> 04:03.000
Say hello to DDR Angel.

04:03.000 --> 04:04.000
Hello.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
Alright.

04:05.000 --> 04:12.560
Well, it should be another fun-filled show tonight.

04:12.560 --> 04:18.440
We've got all the regular stuff you like to hear, our weeks, our day, cage match, and

04:18.440 --> 04:20.640
who knows what else?

04:20.640 --> 04:23.640
Possibly some Bahmani news and all that fun stuff as well.

04:23.640 --> 04:28.500
We will get into that when we come back from a quick break, and this break, I don't really

04:28.500 --> 04:33.800
have an idea for music that I want to hear in particular, so I think we'll just kind

04:33.800 --> 04:36.000
of do some Bahmani randomness.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.160
We'll start it off with some Thomas Howard LECHSCHRISCHEIN!

04:40.160 --> 04:47.160
We'll be back after this.

05:10.160 --> 05:12.960
You want to follow me

05:12.960 --> 05:15.660
Wear dresses too tight

05:15.660 --> 05:19.660
But you can't let her see you there

05:19.660 --> 05:21.660
But she's a hot one

05:21.660 --> 05:23.160
And a fiend

05:23.160 --> 05:25.660
Tú la senorita

05:25.660 --> 05:28.160
You'll never get those in love

05:28.160 --> 05:31.160
Tú la senorita

05:33.160 --> 05:35.160
Hoorah!

05:35.160 --> 05:37.160
A lot of women

05:37.160 --> 05:49.160
I know she has a mind and an attitude And she has a space and a style and a tune

05:49.160 --> 05:52.160
She sees you, believes you, feeling good over you

05:52.160 --> 05:59.160
Like you knew she would when she smiled It's like the sun shining on your face

05:59.160 --> 06:05.160
Falling and stretching the land of the day

06:05.160 --> 06:11.160
And she's a hot woman, a little young, full of senorita

06:11.160 --> 06:16.160
Mom, California, full of senorita

06:16.160 --> 06:21.160
Who loves a European?

06:38.160 --> 06:41.160
Who can make waves all over town?

06:41.160 --> 06:47.160
Can you see me comin'? Everybody dancin' around

06:47.160 --> 06:53.160
With a spoon can do the talkin' back down, down

06:53.160 --> 07:11.160
I'm a lazy man that's a turtle, not too free

07:11.160 --> 07:16.160
I told your daughter, can't stay up all week

07:16.160 --> 07:24.160
And I feel good for the road I'm sliding next to you

07:36.160 --> 07:44.160
Yeah, this is your roundabout of pain Nobody's getting my way

07:44.160 --> 07:53.160
Heaven in the 50s, heaven in the 70s, yeah

08:03.160 --> 08:07.160
I was the happiest guy

08:07.160 --> 08:11.160
That's what everyone said

08:11.160 --> 08:15.160
And never once thought I was lonely then

08:15.160 --> 08:20.160
Still, I believe in nothing so well

08:20.160 --> 08:24.160
No one could ever tell

08:24.160 --> 08:27.160
Just a funny face

08:27.160 --> 08:30.160
On an empty shell

08:30.160 --> 08:35.160
And when you came along

08:35.160 --> 08:38.160
You didn't even see I was wrong

08:38.160 --> 08:45.160
I know it's just my mind, but I don't really care cause I'm down

08:45.160 --> 08:53.160
I'm with you, I'm with you, don't bring me down

08:53.160 --> 09:02.160
I'm with you, I'm with you, don't bring me down

09:02.160 --> 09:10.160
When I dream of you, I want you to learn to do what you just do.

09:10.160 --> 09:14.160
Tell me now, what you want to do.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.160
Tell me now, what you want to do.

09:18.160 --> 09:26.160
I want to stay in the car, and you never know.

09:26.160 --> 09:30.160
Show me what is better, don't you know.

09:30.160 --> 09:40.160
I don't know what you mean to me, but what you mean I don't know

10:00.160 --> 10:04.560
you know, stuff happens. So Ballad For You was a mistake. No, Ballad For You is not a

10:04.560 --> 10:05.040
mistake.

10:05.040 --> 10:08.240
Just like this next song, The Torture will continue here with Thomas Howard. One

10:08.240 --> 10:08.720
more song.

10:08.720 --> 10:09.720
We'll be back after this.

10:38.720 --> 10:42.720
It's such a special day

10:42.720 --> 10:48.720
Tonight is the night for our love yous

10:48.720 --> 10:55.720
Wish we could have this evening

10:55.720 --> 11:00.720
The year Christmas is here

11:00.720 --> 11:05.720
Christmas is here

11:05.720 --> 11:13.720
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

11:13.720 --> 11:19.720
Night falls on you

11:19.720 --> 11:22.720
And if you know

11:22.720 --> 11:26.720
We need you

11:26.720 --> 11:28.720
My heart is beating with you

11:28.720 --> 11:34.720
You are the light of the night on my side

11:34.720 --> 11:37.720
I'm a mama, you know I can fall

11:37.720 --> 11:41.720
I'm a thousand fears, your heart is strong

11:41.720 --> 11:46.720
Christmas is here

11:51.720 --> 11:53.720
Orange Lounge Radio

11:53.720 --> 11:54.720
Bomani Music

11:54.720 --> 11:55.720
And more

11:55.720 --> 11:56.720
Perfect!

11:56.720 --> 11:58.720
Alright, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio

11:58.720 --> 12:01.720
Hope you enjoyed that break full of Thomas Howard

12:03.720 --> 12:05.720
He's named after a small country in Europe

12:07.720 --> 12:09.720
So, that's a fun little segment there

12:09.720 --> 12:14.120
there. You know, and it's funny because our chat room is very polarized there where some

12:14.120 --> 12:18.300
folks are like, Fuck you! I can't believe you're playing this! Fuck you guys on Orange

12:18.300 --> 12:21.180
Lounge Radio! You guys suck! I can't believe we're listening to you guys! And then some

12:21.180 --> 12:26.820
guys are like, Yay! I love Orange Lounge Radio because they play Tom and Tom! Yay! If they

12:26.820 --> 12:33.040
hate us so much, why are they listening? Because, secretly, they know the next break will be

12:33.040 --> 12:37.000
something decent. You know, we play things from the entire Bimani spectrum. It'll be

12:37.000 --> 12:42.680
a break of nothing but I love that feeling. Little do they realize it's the Thomas Howard

12:42.680 --> 12:48.560
show today and they won't be getting anything else. I swear to God I will be playing Forever

12:48.560 --> 12:56.080
Sunshine next break. But with... Rob. What? Rob. What? Rob Rob Rob Rob Rob. What? Play

12:56.080 --> 13:00.180
the song and I will kill you. Well, there's actually damn good reason to be playing Forever

13:00.180 --> 13:05.980
Sunshine next break and I'll get into that later. I will kill you with a ferret. I will

13:05.980 --> 13:09.800
kill you in the house I will kill you with the mouse will you will you kill me

13:09.800 --> 13:15.100
in a bus will you get on it wasn't this like six weeks ago when we got into this

13:15.100 --> 13:26.320
yeah dr. Seuss show dr. redfish bluefish and you got a deal yes would you piss on

13:26.320 --> 13:34.240
a train with all right stop stop anyway I was gonna say that I liked Elle

13:34.240 --> 13:47.240
I love this station, giving the fans what they don't want.

13:47.240 --> 13:53.680
You know that neon FM game that's coming out, the new one with the pad that's going to look

13:53.680 --> 13:59.360
like a Beatmania pad, so I've been joking and calling this game Feetmania FM.

13:59.360 --> 14:00.980
It has a lot of Thomas Howard in it.

14:00.980 --> 14:01.980
Thomas Howard.

14:01.980 --> 14:02.980
Yay!

14:02.980 --> 14:08.400
So, and there's supposed to be a song called Girl's Butts.

14:08.400 --> 14:14.740
I'm looking very forward to being able to play that one on the station, so we'll see.

14:14.740 --> 14:19.420
Our webcam is not up just yet, but look, he's getting that set up right now as we speak.

14:19.420 --> 14:22.420
We're kind of getting the ball rolling very last minute tonight, because, you know, we

14:22.420 --> 14:26.500
just had better things to do, like Final Fantasy XI, and, um...

14:26.500 --> 14:30.500
I only played once this week.

14:30.500 --> 14:33.500
Actually, I've been pretty good on the Final Fantasy XI addiction this week.

14:33.500 --> 14:36.500
I actually played DDR today.

14:36.500 --> 14:42.500
Granted, I was playing controller on Ultramix 2 on Xbox Live, but I was actually having fun.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
But I'll get into that later.

14:44.500 --> 14:48.500
Let's start off tonight's show as we always do, playing a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

14:48.500 --> 14:50.500
Starting off with the lovely Dark Sakura.

14:50.500 --> 14:52.500
I spent the whole week on coding.

14:52.500 --> 15:00.500
I went to the doctor, and he gave me some lovely drugs, except I misread the label in my sickness and read teaspoon as tablespoon.

15:00.500 --> 15:09.500
So all Monday at work, I was taking this gua-phenicin with codeine syrup at basically triple doses four times a day.

15:09.500 --> 15:15.500
I was high as a kite and feeling little pain. I was very happy.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.500
Remember kids, drugs are bad.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.500
Okay.

15:19.500 --> 15:29.580
But, uh, yes they do. What you talking about? We do endorse burping off the couch.

15:29.580 --> 15:35.300
You endorse recreational Waltussin use? I don't take Waltussin anymore. It's got sugar

15:35.300 --> 15:43.460
in it. Oh. But they make sugar-free Coca Cola.

15:43.460 --> 15:47.820
I don't know why things that aren't usually funny are funny tonight. Maybe I'm high on

15:47.820 --> 15:53.740
I don't know you you sound like you're still coughing up a little bit of lung

15:53.740 --> 15:57.860
butter over there yeah but it's a good thing because I have a voice finally

15:57.860 --> 16:02.780
sort of that's good I think with my CD player today it was great tonight you

16:02.780 --> 16:15.300
don't sound like grandma orange lounge I got a good but uh I you know the week

16:15.300 --> 16:20.300
I think it was pretty much normal crap. I, of course, didn't go to the gym, but I did go yesterday.

16:20.300 --> 16:26.300
I went to spin class, and I was very sad because the teacher who I wanted to teach a spin class wasn't teaching it,

16:26.300 --> 16:31.300
because she might be sick with other issues, and so I'm really worried.

16:31.300 --> 16:33.300
But my friend...

16:33.300 --> 16:36.300
I just ferreted Jamie's laptop.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.300
You touch the pressures and you die.

16:39.300 --> 16:40.300
Sorry.

16:40.300 --> 16:42.300
You go to hell and you die!

16:42.300 --> 16:51.340
anyway. Rob just picked his nose. I did not pick my nose, I scratched my nose. If the

16:51.340 --> 16:57.740
webcam faced over here, I'd demand an instant replay. Yeah, too bad that you'd have to be

16:57.740 --> 17:03.880
picking your nose for like a minute straight for that to work. Wow, you really did fuss

17:03.880 --> 17:10.860
with that mic, that's good and loud now. I tell you, it's probably just because, you

17:10.860 --> 17:16.620
You know, pulling cords out through, you know, over the, um, audio board there, every now

17:16.620 --> 17:20.980
and then a cord gets stuck on a knob, and then, you know, the knob turns, and then the

17:20.980 --> 17:23.420
audio gets all fucked up.

17:23.420 --> 17:25.660
Needs to be, like, in a glass case or something.

17:25.660 --> 17:27.980
Loki has his magic gummy bears again.

17:27.980 --> 17:28.980
Dun dun dun!

17:28.980 --> 17:33.580
Seriously, if you guys were listening to the podcast this last week, Loki was, like, turned

17:33.580 --> 17:39.460
down to, like, 20% level or something, but it was pleasant, because his anger was subdued.

17:39.460 --> 17:47.860
I still have to tell you about my damn week!

17:47.860 --> 17:52.620
For those people wondering why this segment takes so damn long, this is why, right here.

17:52.620 --> 17:55.340
It's called We Digress.

17:55.340 --> 18:02.380
Anyway, I hung out with my friend Melody yesterday, who is not Sharks Girl.

18:02.380 --> 18:11.020
She is a friend of mine who I worked with at the evil student loan company and she met

18:11.020 --> 18:18.900
her fiance through work and he lives in Delaware so she's moving to Delaware next month.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.860
We're in Delaware in Delaware.

18:20.860 --> 18:22.580
Okay, knock it off.

18:22.580 --> 18:29.400
But anyway, this is the last chance I really get to hang out with her so we went to see

18:29.400 --> 18:34.600
Constantine yesterday which I actually liked and I've even read a little bit of

18:34.600 --> 18:38.840
the Hellblazer comics so where it was a bit different I actually liked it as a

18:38.840 --> 18:45.040
movie it was pretty cool I think is how I like movies that just totally screw

18:45.040 --> 18:50.680
with theology and you know yeah that's also I guess the reason why I like Angel

18:50.680 --> 18:58.520
Sanctuary too um anyway we saw that I went to her apartment to meet her cat

18:58.520 --> 19:02.560
Simon she went to my apartment to meet Shermy she took two pictures of me and

19:02.560 --> 19:12.800
five pictures of Shermy anyway we went I took her to meet Dan and Dan did his

19:12.800 --> 19:16.960
stuff he was working so then we went to Chevy's which but has did he managed to

19:16.960 --> 19:22.120
sell any ignition pads I don't know I don't care I don't keep up with that he's

19:22.120 --> 19:27.600
up to an inventory tonight okay um but we went to Chevy's and then went to

19:27.600 --> 19:31.360
cheesecake factory I decided to make yesterday my cheat day so the box of

19:31.360 --> 19:35.600
Samoas is gonna wait until my birthday because that's my next cheat day I'm

19:35.600 --> 19:43.360
having two cheat days next month and then we went back and Dan came home when

19:43.360 --> 19:46.080
we were hanging out at my place because I was burning off the copy of Battle Royale

19:46.080 --> 19:56.040
for her and we watched the ring and the part of the an evening with Kevin Smith

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
Isn't The Ring 2 out this week?

19:58.040 --> 20:00.040
I don't know, is it this week?

20:00.040 --> 20:01.040
This Friday.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.040
Holy shit, I have to go.

20:03.040 --> 20:10.040
I'm looking to see, I want to see because I heard that they were trying to incorporate some stuff from the books.

20:10.040 --> 20:15.040
And I really like the books over the movies because the books go in such a completely different direction.

20:15.040 --> 20:18.040
Which I kind of wish the movies had, but it would not have been realistic.

20:18.040 --> 20:28.200
So I'm really curious and otherwise today's been kind of, oh yeah, today I actually was

20:28.200 --> 20:33.520
outside taking pictures of nature because for my Photoshop class I have to do a composite

20:33.520 --> 20:38.200
of three pictures into like a fantasy setting.

20:38.200 --> 20:43.000
And I've got one of a bridge and like two other ones and eh, I'm going to play with

20:43.000 --> 20:44.000
them.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.000
I got my pictures from Alabama developed.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.000
I managed to spend $75 at Walgreens.

20:48.000 --> 20:51.000
Did they let you do digital photography and photo classes now?

20:51.000 --> 20:53.000
Because when I was in college you had to use the old cameras...

20:53.000 --> 20:56.000
This isn't a photo class. This is Photoshop.

20:56.000 --> 20:58.000
Oh, okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.000
And he doesn't care how we get him as long as we get him.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.000
I gotcha.

21:02.000 --> 21:04.000
Um...

21:04.000 --> 21:06.000
But...

21:06.000 --> 21:10.000
That's pretty much it and I got to hang out with Dan and Julie today.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.000
And then Dan had to go to work and I went back home.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.000
Ah!

21:44.000 --> 21:52.000
spots yesterday, and that was okay. It was free, and I got a lot of popcorn, so that was all good.

21:52.000 --> 22:03.000
And then, um, yesterday we watched SpongeBob SquarePants, the movie, and that movie is weird.

22:03.000 --> 22:10.000
I'm a goopy goober, yeah. You're a goopy goober, yeah. That movie rocked, I absolutely loved it.

22:10.000 --> 22:14.000
This is so random, it's just... I don't even know.

22:14.000 --> 22:20.000
I mean, I was kind of a fan of SpongeBob SquarePants before, but now, like, oh my god, he's so awesome.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.000
I can safely say I have never, ever, ever, ever seen any.

22:23.000 --> 22:26.000
You need to see the movie. It is awesome.

22:26.000 --> 22:31.000
Honestly, I hate SpongeBob SquarePants, but the movie was good. I like the movie.

22:31.000 --> 22:37.000
I find SpongeBob SquarePants to be completely retarded and just annoying, and the movie was just...

22:37.000 --> 22:43.000
It was so different from the show. It was kind of weird because it was actually, you know, very random sort of like...

22:43.000 --> 22:45.000
It was what Nellie said. It was a stoner movie.

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
It was a stoner movie.

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
It was Cheech and Chong.

22:47.000 --> 22:52.000
It was just like, and it was like, they had so many homosexual innuendos in that movie.

22:52.000 --> 22:57.000
Like, especially the ending where they do like a kiss-type ending.

22:57.000 --> 23:00.000
Forget, I don't know if there was a kiss movie. I'm sure there was.

23:00.000 --> 23:07.120
was but it's totally the kiss ending and then they was a Patrick is wearing

23:07.120 --> 23:14.600
fishnet stockings yes and stilettos stilettos it's just rubber boots it's

23:14.600 --> 23:20.520
just weird but um I don't know it was kind of funny it was just a completely

23:20.520 --> 23:27.200
different none earlier in the week I had watched white noise and that movie was

23:27.200 --> 23:34.300
And, um, yeah. It was weird. They're just so gonna... It just, like, had an ending that

23:34.300 --> 23:39.480
made no sense in that movie. It's just... You're leading up, you find there's this guy,

23:39.480 --> 23:44.040
you know, and there's these three ghosts that have been killing people, and then, you know,

23:44.040 --> 23:47.960
the resolution to the movie, the ghosts break every bone in this guy's body and throw him

23:47.960 --> 23:55.200
off a building. The end. I was like, oh, gee, thanks! That's nice. So now I've been told

23:55.200 --> 24:00.200
by my fiance that I'm not supposed to meddle with the dead. I'm still gonna.

24:00.200 --> 24:08.200
Yeah, just open your gateway to hell. I know! Every time I think about doing it, I get tired.

24:08.200 --> 24:19.200
We'll sell soul for Gil. Yeah. Anyways. And then, um, what else did I do this week? Eh,

24:19.200 --> 24:24.200
Yeah, that much. That's about it. You know, just kind of playing Final Fantasy and...

24:26.200 --> 24:32.200
Yeah, I just did nothing. Like usual. Still waiting for my damn interview. For the game's sales position.

24:34.200 --> 24:35.200
Still waiting.

24:36.200 --> 24:37.200
Okay.

24:37.200 --> 24:38.200
And that's it.

24:39.200 --> 24:41.200
Alright. Angel, how was your week? How was your day?

24:41.200 --> 24:45.200
Oh, wait. Actually, before we get into that, I actually got a clip. Sorry, Angel.

24:45.200 --> 24:51.200
I got a clip of that song, Girls Butts, Mikle Tom somehow had it and he sent it over to me.

24:51.200 --> 24:57.200
Oh, yeah

25:21.200 --> 25:27.840
Actually, I don't think that version in particular is sung by Thomas Howard.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.080
I think that is DJ Potato doing that one.

25:30.080 --> 25:34.120
But it's the same song, so you can get a pretty good idea there.

25:34.120 --> 25:35.120
Very interesting.

25:35.120 --> 25:36.800
Okay, just wanted to follow up there.

25:36.800 --> 25:37.800
Angel.

25:37.800 --> 25:40.520
I wish this week never existed.

25:40.520 --> 25:41.520
Ever.

25:41.520 --> 25:42.520
Ever.

25:42.520 --> 25:46.520
I wish it never existed.

25:46.520 --> 25:54.520
Monday through Wednesday was just fine, and all that good stuff.

25:54.520 --> 26:00.520
Went to school and worked a little, and just all that other stuff.

26:00.520 --> 26:02.520
And then Thursday was school.

26:02.520 --> 26:07.520
And then I come to find out when I come home, as soon as I sat down for my computer,

26:07.520 --> 26:11.520
that my friend had passed away.

26:11.520 --> 26:20.520
And it's one of the guys that I knew in two years in the DJ field, you know, on the radio and stuff.

26:20.520 --> 26:30.520
And let's just say since Thursday it's been kind of a screwed up four days and sleep's been a joke.

26:30.520 --> 26:36.520
And just, you know, me and my other friends have been hanging around there and just comforting each other.

26:36.520 --> 26:40.520
And just, you know, stuff that you need to do when somebody passes away.

26:40.520 --> 26:47.920
I haven't felt this much like sorrow and pain for a really long time and it's just kind

26:47.920 --> 26:51.500
of you know I mean I know I'm gonna get through it I know that all my friends are gonna get

26:51.500 --> 26:57.600
through it but the main thing is we shouldn't forget him and we're not going to and all

26:57.600 --> 27:02.680
that stuff and I just had a really hard week or at least the last four days it's getting

27:02.680 --> 27:10.280
better but you know there's just little things that remind you of this you know somebody

27:10.280 --> 27:14.840
like you'll be walking down the street and you'll see somebody wear a shirt and that

27:14.840 --> 27:18.920
shirt like reminds you of the person that you just lost and just little stuff like that

27:18.920 --> 27:26.560
and so yeah I've been grieving all week except for the first three days of the week so it's

27:26.560 --> 27:31.400
been pretty shitty week and I really don't really want to think about it anyway that's

27:31.400 --> 27:35.680
it I'm sorry to hear about it and I hope you

27:35.680 --> 27:43.480
you know, things get better for you and everything. Wow, how the hell do I follow that? Uh, Angel?

27:43.480 --> 27:47.840
Being here helps, so. I think we should play the girl's butt song again. Aw, jeez. Actually,

27:47.840 --> 27:52.000
maybe if I play the girl's butt song again, um, Angel will feel a little better.

27:52.000 --> 28:05.000
This game has come in every shape and size God says I'll have my time lookin' at girls' butts Wonderin' fish is a crime

28:22.000 --> 28:28.500
Alright, and did the girl's butt song make you feel any better at all miss miss dark sacra? I?

28:30.520 --> 28:32.520
Am not coughing

28:32.880 --> 28:36.400
Did girls butts get rid of your cough. I guess so Wow

28:37.280 --> 28:42.360
Butts is healed me. Oh my god. I felt the power of the girls, but so

28:42.360 --> 28:54.980
Oh my god, this song cures cancer.

28:54.980 --> 29:01.140
Don't tell me that Orange Lounge doesn't better your life, everybody.

29:01.140 --> 29:02.140
My week and my day.

29:02.140 --> 29:03.140
Shit.

29:03.140 --> 29:04.500
What did I do?

29:04.500 --> 29:05.500
Not a whole lot.

29:05.500 --> 29:10.900
I also watched the Spongebob Squarepants movie Friday night, which I thought was awesome.

29:10.900 --> 29:14.900
And I also watched this other movie last night, which was very odd. It was called The Final Cut.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.900
Final Cut with Robin Williams.

29:16.900 --> 29:19.900
Which, I had never heard of this movie in theaters.

29:19.900 --> 29:20.900
It was very limited.

29:20.900 --> 29:22.900
Very, very, very limited, apparently.

29:22.900 --> 29:24.900
So, there was that.

29:24.900 --> 29:26.900
And, um...

29:28.900 --> 29:30.900
I thought that movie was very, um...

29:30.900 --> 29:34.900
Well, obviously it's not what you'd expect from a Robin Williams movie, because it was very dark.

29:34.900 --> 29:36.900
He also did the one-hour photo.

29:36.900 --> 29:38.900
I saw that one. That one's weird.

29:38.900 --> 29:42.500
so all sorts of like very unsettling movies there

29:42.500 --> 29:48.380
um but yeah it was different but I liked it it was a thought-provoking movie it

29:48.380 --> 29:49.180
kinda made you go

29:49.180 --> 29:52.820
that's interesting Friday night I went out to the bar

29:52.820 --> 29:56.380
and it was cool cuz there was this guy that thought it was cool that I play

29:56.380 --> 29:56.900
games

29:56.900 --> 30:00.340
so we talked for a little while and it was weird though because he's not

30:00.340 --> 30:04.540
he's kind of not a big Nintendo supporter

30:04.540 --> 30:07.620
so I had to talk to him about why I believe the GameCube is awesome and all

30:07.620 --> 30:08.300
that so

30:08.300 --> 30:13.140
This is interesting. Um, on the outside of that, you know,

30:13.140 --> 30:18.300
just same old stuff. Went out to karaoke earlier this week because I'm a total karaoke

30:18.300 --> 30:19.060
whore. I love it.

30:19.060 --> 30:23.220
And, uh, actually I went twice this week. That's what a big karaoke whore I am.

30:23.220 --> 30:26.660
I went on Monday night when it's not the usual karaoke guy that I'm

30:26.660 --> 30:30.140
used to. It just wasn't the same. It really wasn't the same.

30:30.140 --> 30:33.820
Um, and that's that. That's it for me.

30:33.820 --> 30:37.620
Alright, um, let's see. So,

30:37.620 --> 30:43.820
We're going to get into another break here and in this break we're going to play two

30:43.820 --> 30:49.260
songs and these two songs have something in common and I'll talk about what these songs

30:49.260 --> 30:52.620
have in common when we come back after this.

30:52.620 --> 30:57.580
listening to Orange Lounge Radio and we'll be back.

31:22.620 --> 31:31.620
City long beach and sand tickles your feet

31:31.620 --> 31:34.620
That's when the winds blow your head

31:34.620 --> 31:40.620
The kids fly forever sunshine

31:40.620 --> 31:44.620
Crying forever sunshine

31:44.620 --> 31:48.620
Crying forever sunshine

31:48.620 --> 31:56.620
This is for the sunshine, and you must be kind

31:56.620 --> 32:03.620
You can be the sunshine, like the sun in the sunshine

32:33.620 --> 32:52.300
You think you could have another baby I could have been a hero today

32:52.300 --> 32:59.300
You could have another baby Shine like the stars up in the sky

32:59.300 --> 33:01.300
All of your regrets

33:02.900 --> 33:05.900
That they choose us like an atomic bomb

33:06.500 --> 33:08.500
Taken at the point of view

33:14.100 --> 33:18.100
You should have another way to choose

33:18.700 --> 33:20.700
And say that truth brings no use

33:21.300 --> 33:23.300
When you've got your futures

33:23.300 --> 33:28.300
I wish I'd light the stars up in the sky

33:34.300 --> 33:37.300
Because

33:37.300 --> 33:41.300
It's a fantasy

33:41.300 --> 33:44.300
Passing by

33:44.300 --> 33:48.300
Just seeing reality

33:48.300 --> 33:52.300
And dreaming like a jewel

33:52.300 --> 34:00.300
Cause it is the only thing to make a future shine

34:03.300 --> 34:05.300
Alright, those two songs have something in common

34:05.300 --> 34:09.300
If you haven't figured it out yet, we'll play two more songs that should give you a little bit of a hint.

34:35.300 --> 34:39.300
So lovely

34:39.300 --> 34:42.300
So soft

34:42.300 --> 34:46.300
So soft

34:46.300 --> 34:48.300
So stop, stop

35:08.300 --> 35:10.300
I see what's wrong with me

35:10.300 --> 35:12.300
I just want to be the driver

35:12.300 --> 35:13.300
I just want to be the mother

35:13.300 --> 35:15.300
I just want to be myself

35:15.300 --> 35:20.800
As we take away the night has shown the way

35:22.300 --> 35:25.800
We didn't notice the light

35:25.800 --> 35:29.800
We disappear

35:29.800 --> 35:33.800
Fly away to find the sea

35:33.800 --> 35:38.300
Feeling love is so deep

35:38.300 --> 35:42.800
Until we reach eternity

35:42.800 --> 35:44.800
Just the

35:50.000 --> 35:52.800
Just the free

35:53.200 --> 35:56.400
Free

35:57.200 --> 36:00.000
People free

36:04.400 --> 36:05.600
Do you feel it?

36:35.600 --> 36:41.580
I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming

36:41.580 --> 36:52.200
I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming, I'm streaming,

36:52.200 --> 37:06.200
I'll see you in the evening

37:22.200 --> 37:24.200
Did you hear it?

37:52.200 --> 38:03.400
Hey, did you hear about that show?

38:03.400 --> 38:04.400
What show?

38:04.400 --> 38:07.640
Well, they play a lot of greats and money and video game music, but if you listen to

38:07.640 --> 38:09.640
it, you have to listen to it again within seven days.

38:09.640 --> 38:11.360
Oh, I've heard of that station.

38:11.360 --> 38:12.360
Really?

38:12.360 --> 38:14.720
Yeah, I even listened to it a couple weeks ago.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.320
Hey, what happens to you if you don't listen to it again?

38:17.320 --> 38:18.320
Well, you die.

38:18.320 --> 38:19.320
I what?

38:19.320 --> 38:20.320
Hey, wait!

38:20.320 --> 38:26.440
Hey! Wait! What's this crazy bitch doing coming out of my computer screen?

38:26.440 --> 38:34.180
Orange Lounge Radio. Listen to Oberguy!

38:34.180 --> 38:37.700
We haven't had an excuse to play that one in a while, but since you guys were talking about, you know,

38:37.700 --> 38:41.240
um, uh, The Ring 2 coming out soon and

38:41.240 --> 38:46.120
you talking about, you know, um, you watching The Ring this week and stuff?

38:46.120 --> 38:48.240
You can totally see up my nose in this picture.

38:48.240 --> 38:50.460
You know, that makes for great radio.

38:50.460 --> 38:53.040
I like Dan's smile, he's like,

38:53.040 --> 38:56.000
Ahh!

38:56.000 --> 38:59.200
He looks like SpongeBob did in that movie when he got all happy.

38:59.200 --> 39:02.720
Do not compare my man to SpongeBob.

39:02.720 --> 39:06.080
Alright, anyway, so if you didn't figure it out,

39:06.080 --> 39:10.920
Forever Sunshine and Regret, a song from Keyboard Mania that we played in there too,

39:10.920 --> 39:11.900
you may not have recognized that,

39:11.900 --> 39:16.240
those are two songs that are assumably in the next song pack. Now we haven't

39:16.240 --> 39:17.800
heard anything official yet,

39:17.800 --> 39:23.540
But, basically what happened is that ZipTie, who you know from DDRFreak and the message

39:23.540 --> 39:27.480
boards over there, she's the one that helps out, I'm not sure if she does single-handedly

39:27.480 --> 39:32.180
or if she just has a major hand in the Ultramix 2 website, well she put up some web-based

39:32.180 --> 39:34.860
clues on what's going to be in the next song pack.

39:34.860 --> 39:38.900
And people have deduced the clues, and you know what, they all make sense, so people

39:38.900 --> 39:41.200
are just pretty much assuming they've got them right.

39:41.200 --> 39:44.420
So Regret and Forever Sunshine, two of the songs that are going to be in there.

39:44.420 --> 39:47.820
and we'll play some of the other songs a little bit more later and of course I

39:47.820 --> 39:52.300
feel the junk circuit mix and more deep or songs that were in the last song pack

39:52.300 --> 39:55.940
so a little hint for you so yes boys and girls you get to download forever

39:55.940 --> 40:05.620
sunshine in the next song pack for DDR doesn't that make you excited oh yay

40:05.620 --> 40:12.860
we now there's an interesting kind of side note to this on the forever

40:12.860 --> 40:18.620
sunshine and actually did you know that there is one person who is responsible

40:18.620 --> 40:23.660
for forever sunshine ending up in the next song pack so I thought we could

40:23.660 --> 40:27.420
actually call that person right now and give them a little piece of our mind

40:27.420 --> 40:35.980
because I'm sure you want to you want to share this so hello hi is this Seagurd

40:35.980 --> 40:40.260
hi it's wow you're really quiet right now but that's alright this is Rob on

40:40.260 --> 40:47.260
Orange Launch Radio. Hey, what's up? Not a lot. So, tell me about Forever Sunshine being

40:47.260 --> 40:54.260
in the next song pack. What do you mean, tell you about it? It's there, and it's awesome,

40:54.260 --> 41:00.260
and everybody who hates it should just go and die. Why did you put, why Forever Sunshine?

41:00.260 --> 41:06.260
Is this your fault? Did you do this? Yeah, it's my fault. How is this your fault? Well,

41:06.260 --> 41:11.860
Well, I picked a whole bunch of songs that I personally like. I didn't care if the other people liked them or not.

41:11.860 --> 41:22.260
Like, Forever Sunshine, like, Fall Alika, that's all me right there, OGC, uh, Regret, those are songs I like, and I was like, well, they'd be cool for DDR, so I suggested them.

41:22.260 --> 41:26.260
But Forever Sunshine was already in DDR, and it sucks!

41:26.260 --> 41:29.760
Yeah, well, it was that, or you could have Let Them Move.

41:29.760 --> 41:32.760
I'd almost rather have Let Them Move. Would it be like a junk circuit mix?

41:32.760 --> 41:34.760
Well, you don't count now, do you?

41:34.760 --> 41:38.760
I guess not. I'm mad at you.

41:38.760 --> 41:42.760
That's okay. You can take it out on me by hitting me at E3 when you go.

41:42.760 --> 41:46.760
I will.

41:46.760 --> 41:50.760
Now are we going to expect to see crappy songs that you picked

41:50.760 --> 41:52.760
in the next song pack, or?

41:52.760 --> 41:56.760
Heck yeah. I mean, if you remember way back when UltraMix 2

41:56.760 --> 42:00.760
was done and they started announcing stuff about song packs, one of the other

42:00.760 --> 42:06.200
other Vivid members said right out loud that a lot of my random one, just me suggesting

42:06.200 --> 42:10.740
that nobody else thought they were good, songs actually made it into song packs, so you haven't

42:10.740 --> 42:12.420
heard the last of my takes.

42:12.420 --> 42:16.720
So if you guys think the songs that are in the song packs suck, you know where to address

42:16.720 --> 42:17.720
those cards and letters.

42:17.720 --> 42:21.080
Yeah, you've got more song packs to worry about.

42:21.080 --> 42:25.160
I know, I'm like, we're only halfway there, barely.

42:25.160 --> 42:27.380
Yeah, exactly, so.

42:27.380 --> 42:35.980
DarkSakra, any choice words for Seagurd? Dot, dot, dot.

42:35.980 --> 42:42.140
Loki, any choice words for Seagurd on his selection of Forever Sunshine?

42:42.140 --> 42:46.060
I don't care, because I already have that stupid song.

42:46.060 --> 42:51.920
Incept Mania, uh-huh. I'm not buying no fucking song pack, nor am

42:51.920 --> 42:55.080
I getting Ultra Mix 2. You don't even have an Xbox, so you don't

42:55.080 --> 43:07.360
account. Well, I have an Xbox shell. But, yeah, you know what? You guys got to pay for

43:07.360 --> 43:12.040
five dollars for shit. I know, if I want to pay, like, if I want to pay five dollars to

43:12.040 --> 43:15.600
get cool songs, like the other songs that were announced, like... Dude, hello? What

43:15.600 --> 43:20.880
the hell? Okay, let's pick Forever Sunshine, because that's so much better than... I can't

43:20.880 --> 43:27.880
Oh, I was saying, what's cooler than Forever Sunshine? You could save $5 for that. You should steal privilege.

43:27.880 --> 43:33.380
Um, I don't know, how about every other Bhimani song in existence is cooler than Forever Sunshine?

43:34.380 --> 43:35.380
Whatever.

43:35.880 --> 43:37.380
I have an idea!

43:37.380 --> 43:39.380
Forever Sunshine rocks!

43:39.380 --> 43:46.880
Let's just get that because, you know, songs like The Fall or Hellscraper, or I don't know, whatever else we can put out there.

43:46.880 --> 43:55.380
You know, maybe anything that's in 2DX, you know, Ted Style, or anything below that, or I don't know, Beatmanium, you know?

43:55.380 --> 43:56.880
All those songs suck.

43:56.880 --> 44:04.880
Come on! How often do you get a random, just, one song that's appeared in only one mix, you know, just appear out of nowhere?

44:04.880 --> 44:08.880
We've got 2DX songs. We don't need more 2DX songs. We're done with 2DX songs.

44:08.880 --> 44:14.880
That's why I pick songs from Keyboard Mania, and Drum Mania, and one-time uses in DDR.

44:14.880 --> 44:16.880
Secret, I have a question for you. Do you like The Muppets?

44:16.880 --> 44:18.880
Muppets? No?

44:18.880 --> 44:22.880
Well, because Forever Sunshine sounds like Miss Piggy singing it!

44:22.880 --> 44:25.880
Did you know that Malcolm in the Middle guy sounds like Kermit now?

44:28.880 --> 44:32.880
Is the Rainbow Connection going to be in the next song pack? That's what I'm curious about.

44:33.880 --> 44:34.880
The what?

44:34.880 --> 44:36.880
The Rainbow Connect- oh, forget it.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.880
Forget it.

44:39.880 --> 44:41.880
My insults are lost on you.

44:42.880 --> 44:43.880
They really are.

44:44.880 --> 44:45.880
Alright, well thanks.

44:46.880 --> 44:49.880
Anything else you want to share with our listener Seeker before I hang up on you out of pure anger?

44:49.880 --> 44:58.880
So, I guess they should just learn to deal with what they're given. That's it. They should shut up and quit being like DDR freak.

45:19.880 --> 45:24.560
revolution in Bamani, you know when I, like, was announced like a month ago and I completely

45:24.560 --> 45:29.500
forgot to mention on this program until just right now? Um, that Bamani karaoke revolution

45:29.500 --> 45:37.500
game got cancelled. So those of you guys that wanted to sing Love Shine at home and stuff,

45:37.500 --> 45:42.400
sorry. No karaoke for you.

45:42.400 --> 45:43.400
Funny.

45:43.400 --> 45:50.400
cuz i saw that forever sunshine was in it

45:50.400 --> 45:57.400
yeah i guess forever sunshine was in the next karaoke revolution game

45:57.400 --> 46:03.400
the memani one and so they had to cancel it because they realized that sucks

46:03.400 --> 46:08.400
they couldn't put forever sunshine in there because i don't know

46:08.400 --> 46:13.400
Just sucks. I had something there, but it just went away.

46:13.400 --> 46:15.400
Alright. I'm gonna need more gummy bears.

46:15.400 --> 46:21.400
Out of curiosity, you started off last week with a five pound bag of gummy bears. How many pounds are left?

46:21.400 --> 46:25.400
Probably like a pound and a half. That's a lot of gummy.

46:25.400 --> 46:28.400
I helped, though. I did help.

46:28.400 --> 46:30.400
I have about a pound left.

46:30.400 --> 46:35.400
I was offering gummy bears to people. I said, hi. I know these are my roommates, but you want some gummy bears?

46:35.400 --> 46:41.400
One summer I went through three bags in about a week.

46:41.400 --> 46:42.400
Oh my god.

46:42.400 --> 46:48.020
It's great when you leave them in your car and they get all stuck together like a big

46:48.020 --> 46:49.900
gummy mass.

46:49.900 --> 46:54.140
Alright, let's talk about some Bimani news.

46:54.140 --> 46:57.580
This isn't necessarily Bimani per se, but it has to do with the Dance Mania series,

46:57.580 --> 47:00.860
which is where a lot of Bimani songs came from, so I know a lot of you guys are into

47:00.860 --> 47:02.660
the Dance Mania series.

47:02.660 --> 47:06.660
Dance Mania Speed G4 has been announced.

47:06.660 --> 47:09.660
You know, I have issues with this already.

47:09.660 --> 47:10.660
Why? Why?

47:10.660 --> 47:12.660
Well, because there's G4 in it.

47:12.660 --> 47:16.660
Well, that's the name of the album is Dance Mania Speed G4.

47:16.660 --> 47:19.660
And how appropriate that it should be named that.

47:19.660 --> 47:25.660
You get songs like Toxic, the trance speedo mix by Helen.

47:25.660 --> 47:30.660
And you get other songs like Let's Groove by Beatbox featuring DJ Speedo.

47:30.660 --> 47:34.020
and a song called Wookie Wookie by Jenny Rom

47:34.020 --> 47:39.260
and then piano concerto number one in B flat minor

47:39.260 --> 47:43.620
by Speedmaster. So it's like they're mixing that classical speed.

47:43.620 --> 47:48.900
Speedmaster! And how can we forget Hostile Takeover, the before the beat mix?

47:48.900 --> 47:52.420
Gotta love that one. And then of course

47:52.420 --> 47:56.540
this has got to be the coolest thing that's on there. Theme from Miami Vice

47:56.540 --> 48:02.060
by the extra terror sound. That's cool. But it's a speed version, so I don't know what to expect from that.

48:02.060 --> 48:05.860
So, also smoke on the water,

48:05.860 --> 48:09.940
that's worth mentioning. Uh, you guys will want to check out the full song list. It is posted to our

48:09.940 --> 48:13.300
website, www.orangelaunchradio.com.

48:13.300 --> 48:17.220
But you know what's even cooler? What? You know what else is coming out soon? What?

48:17.220 --> 48:21.220
Air Wolf Season 1 on DVD. Really?

48:21.220 --> 48:26.360
Really. Interesting. And you know what? Dance Mania Speed G4 doesn't have the

48:26.360 --> 48:34.560
airwolf has a fucking kick-ass helicopter that's for sure now that I've

48:34.560 --> 48:39.200
successfully helicopter yeah but you don't have a cool helicopter like this

48:39.200 --> 48:52.360
is like thunder in paradise but in the air and without you know Hulk Hogan and

48:52.360 --> 48:56.520
And what were you doing with it? It was just my normal car. Oh, okay.

48:56.520 --> 49:03.520
I dreamed that I just drove it to work. So you were in, I don't know, Cruisin' World?

49:04.360 --> 49:07.600
I think it was Cruisin' World, wasn't it, that had the Humvee?

49:07.600 --> 49:14.600
That was cool. I used to always use the, the, the, um, the three-wheeled truck.

49:14.600 --> 49:20.720
Alright, other Bahmani news, let's move on.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.820
School Bus!

49:23.820 --> 49:26.240
You know DDR Freak, you ever heard of that website?

49:26.240 --> 49:27.240
I'm not sure if you've heard of it.

49:27.240 --> 49:28.240
Were they?

49:28.240 --> 49:32.940
You know, it's a site, and you know they actually syndicate our program on Friday nights over

49:32.940 --> 49:33.940
on DDR Freak Radio.

49:33.940 --> 49:34.940
Really?

49:34.940 --> 49:35.940
So maybe you've heard of it.

49:35.940 --> 49:36.940
Yeah, I don't know if you've heard of it.

49:36.940 --> 49:37.940
They check them out some day.

49:37.940 --> 49:38.940
Yeah, we should.

49:38.940 --> 49:47.380
ddrfreak.com turned five years old this week. Five years old. How old does that make you

49:47.380 --> 49:51.900
feel? Because I remember when DDRFreak did not look like it did today. It was like, and

49:51.900 --> 49:54.180
it didn't even have like the same address and everything. It's crazy.

49:54.180 --> 50:00.100
I remember it being green. And did it have the same, you know, bad grammar

50:00.100 --> 50:06.220
that we've learned to come and love? Oh indeed. I remember, I remember having the

50:06.220 --> 50:10.400
the biggest post count back in the day.

50:10.400 --> 50:11.400
What happened with that?

50:11.400 --> 50:12.400
Why is it that you had the biggest post count?

50:12.400 --> 50:15.120
Because I don't really post that much.

50:15.120 --> 50:17.220
I just watch threads now.

50:17.220 --> 50:18.220
That's all I do.

50:18.220 --> 50:20.320
Okay, this is stupid.

50:20.320 --> 50:21.320
No flames here.

50:21.320 --> 50:22.320
Moving on.

50:22.320 --> 50:23.320
Nothing to see here.

50:23.320 --> 50:28.500
You can't lock, well you can't lock a thread for being too stupid, but it has to be pointlessly

50:28.500 --> 50:30.300
stupid.

50:30.300 --> 50:34.460
So I thought maybe we could go around and kind of talk about the first time we visited

50:34.460 --> 50:41.580
DDR Freak and what we thought of it. Loki. I read, this is a tribute, by the way, to

50:41.580 --> 50:50.220
DDR Freak Turning 5. I read the, um, what was it? DDR USA, the manual, and in the back

50:50.220 --> 50:56.000
there was a special thanks to ddrfreak.com. That's how I first found the website. To which

50:56.000 --> 51:03.060
then I first found the regional forums, in which I found the link to Sac-Bomani. All

51:03.060 --> 51:06.780
All links to the DDR USA manual. Yes, there are people that actually read that. Yes, I

51:06.780 --> 51:10.020
was that poor. I was gonna say, that's like tiny ass print

51:10.020 --> 51:14.180
in the back of the manual there. I was that bored.

51:14.180 --> 51:18.140
So on your first visit to DDR Freak, you learned about the locals here, so that's cool.

51:18.140 --> 51:21.620
Yep. Alright. Dark Sakhra, your first visit to DDR

51:21.620 --> 51:25.740
Freak. This had to have been... it was right before

51:25.740 --> 51:34.920
A.X. 2000. So, I should write around the time of A.X. 2000, because I was just getting into

51:34.920 --> 51:39.020
a lot of it. I was looking for more people who play, and I just started posting there,

51:39.020 --> 51:44.880
found people who had other interests, and then I randomly made the Sacramento thread

51:44.880 --> 51:52.660
on DVR Freak. And, oh my god, did we get yelled at in that thread, because we were random.

51:52.660 --> 51:57.420
And I will, I'll tell you what, it was nothing compared to the random chat you see today

51:57.420 --> 51:58.420
on DDR Free.

51:58.420 --> 52:02.580
But man, people were like, you guys are losers, right?

52:02.580 --> 52:03.580
You know what?

52:03.580 --> 52:04.580
They didn't want to see it.

52:04.580 --> 52:06.580
They didn't have to click that thread.

52:06.580 --> 52:07.580
Amen.

52:07.580 --> 52:12.100
How'd you end up becoming a moderator over there?

52:12.100 --> 52:14.360
Because I was a good babysitter.

52:14.360 --> 52:18.020
I had this habit of insinuating myself between people's arguments just because I didn't want

52:18.020 --> 52:19.660
to see all the crap.

52:19.660 --> 52:20.660
And I posted so much.

52:20.660 --> 52:21.660
I was available.

52:21.660 --> 52:24.340
when I was working at GNC.

52:24.340 --> 52:27.580
I was available all the time and posted all the time

52:27.580 --> 52:31.800
and had pretty good people skills so I got offered the position.

52:31.800 --> 52:36.640
Right as my cable went down.

52:36.640 --> 52:37.960
But it was pretty cool.

52:37.960 --> 52:39.840
I still like doing it. I kinda

52:39.840 --> 52:46.600
got really busy with stuff for a while and then I'm back in it now.

52:46.600 --> 52:50.280
I'm trying to remember my first visit to DDR Freak. I don't remember about when it was. I think it was

52:50.280 --> 52:54.440
about the time I discovered the machine at RVGL I think I'd done a search on the

52:54.440 --> 52:58.880
internet for DDR and I found DDR Freak that way and I do remember the boards

52:58.880 --> 53:02.040
were green and I remember a lot of people that were posting were all in the

53:02.040 --> 53:05.440
Bay Area and they were talking about the songs they were playing and passing in

53:05.440 --> 53:09.680
the freestyle stuff and I was just kind of like these guys are sick obsessive

53:09.680 --> 53:15.840
little freaks which is really funny in retrospect that I thought that but then

53:15.840 --> 53:22.240
I lurked for a long time. I lurked for probably a good two months. I remember

53:22.240 --> 53:27.020
when I was lurking they were not using a PHP board, they were using some other

53:27.020 --> 53:30.900
type of web board when I first was looking at it. I was lurking at it and

53:30.900 --> 53:34.360
then when they did the PHP board I think that's when I finally signed up. But it's

53:34.360 --> 53:37.580
not the same one that we know now. Like there was another, like there was another

53:37.580 --> 53:41.000
board in between I don't even remember, but that's when I signed up and stopped

53:41.000 --> 53:44.040
lurking and it was probably about the same time as that sacramentals thread

53:44.040 --> 53:48.760
because I remember us all taking that trip to the Bay Area to play Para Para

53:48.760 --> 53:54.660
for the first time. That was pretty awesome. So that was my first DDR Freak

53:54.660 --> 54:01.120
experience. Angel, do you remember? Yeah, unfortunately I was the late bloomer out

54:01.120 --> 54:07.160
of all of you guys, but that's okay. Actually I'll blame it on Orange Lounge.

54:07.160 --> 54:13.040
Probably around 2002 or so, so you know like I said I was a late bloomer out of all of

54:13.040 --> 54:19.280
you guys, but it's pretty cool. I still... I don't do the forums, you know, as far as

54:19.280 --> 54:23.560
posting is concerned, because someone took my name, so, you know, and I can't

54:23.560 --> 54:29.400
think of anything else that's cool, so, you know, because my handle's my handle, so I

54:29.400 --> 54:36.960
just, you know, look and read stuff, but other than that, no.

54:36.960 --> 54:42.640

54:54.480 --> 54:59.100

01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:19.820
chat. Hi, you're on Orange Lawn's radio. Hey Sky, Siggy here. Hello Siggy, how are you?

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:25.260
I don't feel asleep. I just woke up. So you fell asleep and you missed the first part of Orange

01:02:25.260 --> 01:02:30.940
Lawn's radio? Well, just only, you know, just the first 30 minutes. That's all right. You know about

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:37.980
the best thing that you missed so far? What? Oh, I didn't miss that, really.

01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:46.180
I didn't miss that oh sorry I didn't miss that okay well then I guess I guess

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:49.340
you really didn't miss anything that good then hey I'm actually kind of glad

01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.340
you called in I don't know what you called in to talk about but I got a

01:02:52.340 --> 01:02:56.340
question for you anything new on night style any new news going on there cuz

01:02:56.340 --> 01:02:59.980
I'm actually excited about I was about to say that actually hooray we're like

01:02:59.980 --> 01:03:05.420
minded as of today ooh yeah there's been you know there was a

01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:13.920
Tokyo Demo held yesterday in Japan, and this is what they've said so far about, you know, a demo of the night style.

01:03:13.920 --> 01:03:14.420
Ooh!

01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:23.920
Yeah, there was no revival song information was revealed because, you know, the demo only had 32 songs, and no old songs were revealed.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.420
Interesting, so they're trying to keep things secret then.

01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:27.420
Mm-hmm.

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:30.420
Did any word get out about the timing?

01:03:30.420 --> 01:03:37.820
Because you remember, when Nightstar came out in the arcades, people bitched about the timing issues in it, so I'm wondering how that's going to affect the home version.

01:03:37.820 --> 01:03:45.620
Well, according to people who went there, the timing seems to be fine, though a few people have mentioned that it seems tighter than previous versions.

01:03:45.620 --> 01:03:53.620
Whether it was just due to the environment, you know, like the controller, TV positioning, etc., or was an actual timing difference is unknown.

01:03:53.620 --> 01:03:59.420
Interesting, yeah, that's true, because if you're playing it at a loud expo, it's probably going to be hard to nail the timing like you usually do.

01:03:59.420 --> 01:04:04.420
Um, interesting though. Hey, I'd be okay with that if they were tightening up the timing windows a little bit, but just...

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:11.420
You know how Night Style and the Arcade had this whole different feel to it, probably because of, you know, rumors that they had changed some hardware and things like that.

01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:16.420
Um, you know. Interesting. Anything else that's going on with Night Style that you know of?

01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:20.420
Um, Random Plus is set to be there.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:20.420
Uh-huh.

01:04:20.420 --> 01:04:24.420
Uh, High Speed Force is there, so if anybody's worried.

01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:31.420
Very interesting that we don't know any of the consumer songs yet, considering we're only about, what, two weeks away from release?

01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:35.420
We don't really know a whole lot about those consumer tracks, hopefully.

01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:41.420
Speaking of consumer tracks, there are five CS exclusive songs that have been released.

01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:49.420
Here they are, the genre, and I'll mention the genre, the song, and the artist.

01:04:49.420 --> 01:04:50.420
Oh, so these are for Nightstyle?

01:04:50.420 --> 01:04:51.420
Yeah.

01:04:51.420 --> 01:04:52.420
Oh, cool, okay.

01:04:52.420 --> 01:04:56.980
The genre here is Dance Pop, and it's a Usual Days remix by OTA-2.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:05:02.020
It's four-star on Light Seven, seven-star on Seven Keys.

01:05:02.020 --> 01:05:07.580
And then Ragged Jungle, five p.m. Eternal by Garuvi, featuring No-Chien.

01:05:07.580 --> 01:05:12.180
Five-star on Light Seven, Flashing Seven on Seven Keys.

01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:16.380
Is that LED in Garuvi, or just Garuvi? Just Garuvi. Interesting, okay.

01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:21.020
And then the genre is Discotek, 80s capsule by Megumi Upper Slope.

01:05:21.020 --> 01:05:23.900
three star on light seven, four star on seven keys.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.940
Okay. Club Jazz,

01:05:26.940 --> 01:05:31.540
Paramnesia by Ushiroda Shinji, four star on light seven,

01:05:31.540 --> 01:05:34.980
six star on seven keys. Alright. And then the fifth song,

01:05:34.980 --> 01:05:39.340
which, you know, uh, uh, genre is drum and bass, Photogenic

01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.420
by L.E.D. featuring, uh, Horisawa Michael.

01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:48.340
Six star on light seven, seven star on seven keys. Those are the only five songs

01:05:48.340 --> 01:05:49.380
that have been

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:52.720
announced so far. So there are two more, which is our...

01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:56.300
That's more than I knew about already, so that's cool. So that's good the LED's gonna

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:00.140
have one in there, so I, cause I always like his stuff. Even though it all kinda sounds

01:06:00.140 --> 01:06:02.460
similar, I'm excited to see that's gonna be there.

01:06:02.460 --> 01:06:06.480
Let me, let me send you this, this link on the website, which is actually a screenshot

01:06:06.480 --> 01:06:10.840
of the menu, the menu select interface of 2DX Night Style.

01:06:10.840 --> 01:06:15.920
Oh, very cool. So that's you posting in the chatroom there as Darkland XBI, for those

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:21.380
just click on that link. Alright, very cool. Let me, I'm pulling it up here on my end here

01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:27.380
on the computer. Ah, okay. Okay. That looks, okay, it pretty much looks like the arcade

01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:31.580
did a little bit, a little bit condensed down, but I like that. It's a good look. I always,

01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:35.740
I like, I just like 9th Style a whole bunch. So, I, it's gonna, it's gonna be the one that

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:39.540
gets me back into 2DX. And I know I said that about 7th and 8th, and it didn't work, but

01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.960
9th Style will be the one. It will. Yeah. And just, in case you notice on the picture

01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:49.740
that there are clear lamps are in there you know that like the colored markers

01:06:49.740 --> 01:06:55.960
like like you go yeah you got this song finished screen good later or not right

01:06:55.960 --> 01:07:00.740
on all right anything else oh yeah wait on

01:07:00.740 --> 01:07:05.340
nine style cs that for those who have played it quasar was supposed to have

01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:10.940
the 10 style video in it oh cool all right right on because you know how

01:07:10.940 --> 01:07:13.940
Now Quasar didn't really have, like it had a generic video in that style, but that doesn't really work.

01:07:13.940 --> 01:07:15.940
Yeah, it's a generic video from the background.

01:07:15.940 --> 01:07:17.940
Oh good, I hope they do give a 10th style video.

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:25.940
I hope that we get a 10th style or a red song in there that crosses over as well. That'd be kind of nice, but I guess we don't know anything yet, huh?

01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:34.940
No, so, yeah, they still have the folder sorting, you know, like by folders, like by letter, by the level of the difficulty of the song.

01:07:34.940 --> 01:07:35.940
Right.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:38.940
They have it, or supposedly have it, in there.

01:07:38.940 --> 01:07:46.940
Cool. Well, I'm sure the next two weeks will be busy two weeks for Night Style News, so hopefully we'll have more stuff next week and the week after, of course.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:48.940
Thank you, as always, for the update, Siggy.

01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.940
Anything else you want to share with the listeners?

01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:52.940
Well, nothing much to say.

01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.940
Alright. Fair enough. Well, thanks for calling in and giving us this update.

01:07:56.940 --> 01:07:57.940
Alright.

01:07:57.940 --> 01:07:58.940
Have a good one.

01:07:58.940 --> 01:07:59.940
Later.

01:07:59.940 --> 01:08:00.940
Later.

01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:05.940
Alright, let's go. Wow, a bunch of people hammering us trying to get in tonight, so we'll just kind of take the calls as we see them.

01:08:05.940 --> 01:08:07.940
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

01:08:07.940 --> 01:08:09.280
Hey, Sky, it's El Mullet.

01:08:09.280 --> 01:08:10.480
Hello, my friend.

01:08:10.480 --> 01:08:11.480
How are you?

01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:12.320
I'm doing good.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:13.160
How about yourself?

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:14.040
I'm pretty good.

01:08:14.040 --> 01:08:16.520
I'm actually kind of glad you called in.

01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:17.040
Really?

01:08:17.040 --> 01:08:17.600
Yes.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:20.320
I have a bone to pick with Inside Pulse.

01:08:20.320 --> 01:08:21.980
Oh, now what?

01:08:21.980 --> 01:08:24.840
I was reading the review of Tekken 5 over there.

01:08:24.840 --> 01:08:26.440
Oh, for crying out loud.

01:08:26.440 --> 01:08:27.800
Not this.

01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:30.800
And the guy was totally dogging on the music.

01:08:30.800 --> 01:08:34.280
And I'm like, oh my gosh, Tekken 5 has great music in it,

01:08:34.280 --> 01:08:35.880
I think.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:37.840
But that would be his opinion.

01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:44.400
I know, I know it wasn't you, but since, you know, you're the closest thing I have to being

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:47.120
able to yell at Inside Pulse, I'm yelling at you.

01:08:47.120 --> 01:08:48.800
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:54.400
Well there always is the link to the, the email link to the person who wrote the review.

01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:57.640
I'm sure he would like another flame to add to his collection.

01:08:57.640 --> 01:09:00.600
I don't want to flame this guy via email.

01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:03.280
I'd rather he call in so I can yell at him in person.

01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:04.280
No.

01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:05.280
That's alright.

01:09:05.280 --> 01:09:09.560
supposed to say when you argue about somebody with music. Arguing with people about music

01:09:09.560 --> 01:09:13.680
is something I never understood because it's like, this song sucks. No it doesn't. Yes

01:09:13.680 --> 01:09:19.200
it does. No it doesn't. I mean, what can you, how can you say, you know, people's perception

01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:24.600
of music is totally and purely opinion, really. You know, it sounds good to me, it may not

01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:26.000
sound good to you. You know, that's just the way it is.

01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.300
Yeah, I completely agree with you there, Sky. It's like, but if we don't have arguments

01:09:30.300 --> 01:09:33.340
about music, we wouldn't have any song pack discussion.

01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:37.020
But one thing we can all agree on is that Forever Sunshine sucks balls.

01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.300
No, I can't agree with you there.

01:09:39.300 --> 01:09:42.700
I cannot agree with you that it sucks balls.

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:47.220
I can tolerate it and enjoy it when I'm in the right mood.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:51.580
I will take Forever Sunshine on this song pack.

01:09:51.580 --> 01:09:58.140
I don't hate it, hate it, want to die like a few songs on Bimani songs that I know of.

01:09:58.140 --> 01:10:01.180
Seagurd brainwashed you, that's what there is to it.

01:10:01.180 --> 01:10:08.180
No, I decently liked Forever Sunshine Long Before Home, alright.

01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:11.180
Well, there was a thought in there, I just figured it out.

01:10:11.180 --> 01:10:15.180
You know what song would be great in an Ultramax song pack, now that I think about it?

01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:25.180
That needs to be played on every episode of Orange Lounge from here to eternity.

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.180
It's gonna be the new inside joke, just wait. It's gonna be the new cake pie.

01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:33.640
just just wait anyway so to what do we owe the guy I got you sidetracked there

01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.420
because I wanted to yell at you but to to what do we owe this call tonight I'm

01:10:36.420 --> 01:10:41.860
all it well we owe this call to well song pack discussion okay and it just

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:47.300
very interesting to see everybody's dog and forever sunshine whether you like it

01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:51.100
or not mm-hmm everyone's dog in it and it's like oh now this song packs going

01:10:51.100 --> 01:10:54.860
to suck because forever Sun shines in it and I'm like okay well a song pack

01:10:54.860 --> 01:11:00.860
The song pack doesn't suck if one bad song is in it, because one good song can make a song pack very good, too.

01:11:00.860 --> 01:11:08.860
Exactly, and that's what I'm trying to get across. There are people out there who have labeled this song pack as bad thanks to one song.

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:11.860
Worst song pack ever!

01:11:11.860 --> 01:11:17.860
Yes, people labeled song pack 3 bad because as soon as they heard Dynamite Rave was going to be on it before it was even released,

01:11:17.860 --> 01:11:23.860
Oh no, it's Dynamite Rave! Everyone's played it already! Go away!

01:11:23.860 --> 01:11:27.420
that's true and I was one of those people but at the same time there were

01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:28.260
things on

01:11:28.260 --> 01:11:31.540
song pack 3 that I was looking forward to and to be honest it's not a big

01:11:31.540 --> 01:11:33.300
surprise either like you know

01:11:33.300 --> 01:11:36.300
way back in the day when USA mix was all there was

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:40.020
dark sakura you remember this how many people would play dynamite rave

01:11:40.020 --> 01:11:43.940
at golf land? everyone. exactly exactly

01:11:43.940 --> 01:11:48.260
but I'm personally looking forward to this song pack I'm definitely looking

01:11:48.260 --> 01:11:49.100
forward to

01:11:49.100 --> 01:11:53.020
the new songs jelly kiss most definitely I had

01:11:53.020 --> 01:11:57.780
put together a list a long, long, long time ago that I never released to anybody of what

01:11:57.780 --> 01:12:02.780
songs I'd like to see on song packs. I put down 19 November, that ended up being on the

01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:06.300
mix, and Jelly Kiss was the only one so far that actually made it.

01:12:06.300 --> 01:12:09.420
You got a Santa thing going on there? Or Sona? Sona?

01:12:09.420 --> 01:12:12.420
I like Sona. Sona's a good group.

01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:17.380
I totally just did the white boy pronunciation. Santa? Anyway.

01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.380
Santa.

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:22.380
That Santa Moleste song, what is that about?

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:26.380
That's pervy.

01:12:26.380 --> 01:12:30.380
Well that's pervy, just wait until Jelly Kiss comes out.

01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:34.380
I'm just glad that

01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:38.380
Ultramix 2 kind of lives on this way through these song packs still coming out.

01:12:38.380 --> 01:12:42.380
Although I am a little upset that it took so darn long to start getting these song packs to roll

01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:46.380
out regularly because there was that hold up with the whole Canadian thing. I'm glad to see

01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:50.660
the song packs coming and keeping you know Ultramix 2 going. Yeah that's fine I

01:12:50.660 --> 01:12:54.460
mean it was all Microsoft's fault here and as soon as SP8 came out I'm sure

01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:59.620
people were dancing in the streets well if they were well dancing enough to do

01:12:59.620 --> 01:13:03.900
so. Yeah you know I was actually playing Ultramix 2 online today it was kind of

01:13:03.900 --> 01:13:08.420
interesting I got I was actually playing another Xbox game and I got an invite

01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:13.780
over to Ultramix 2 from somebody who is I think she is the number one Ultramix

01:13:13.780 --> 01:13:18.780
player, and she's like in the top five of UltraMix 2. And she's really, really good.

01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:23.320
So she sent me a challenge thing, because, you know, we have fun when we play on there.

01:13:23.320 --> 01:13:28.020
So I actually played against her, and it was cool, we were just going down the list alphabetically.

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:30.540
And it was just, you know, we were just going down the list alphabetically, and there's

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:35.260
so many good songs in UltraMix 2. It's just, ugh. I do love that mix, I wish I'd played

01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:39.900
it more. It makes me excited for UltraMix 3. And I know nothing official has been announced

01:13:39.900 --> 01:13:45.020
with Ultramix 3, but come on. There's gotta be an Ultramix 3. You know what else, speaking

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:49.940
of Ultramix, I was actually at Best Buy yesterday, and I was looking for a new game to pick up,

01:13:49.940 --> 01:13:54.780
and I noticed that DDR Ultramix was in Xbox Platinum Hits now. So you can...

01:13:54.780 --> 01:13:58.180
Oh really? Yeah, I saw that the other day. I didn't even realize that. Like, that totally

01:13:58.180 --> 01:14:03.500
came out of nowhere. So, has that been that way for a long time? I think it's more recent.

01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:06.980
Is it more recent? Well, just so you guys know, Ultramix is only 20 bucks now, because

01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.400
platinum hit so you can get the platinum hits cover too because the cover looks a

01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:14.740
little different when your platinum hits the game so it's kind of neat to see so

01:14:14.740 --> 01:14:18.420
yeah so we can now say no matter what you think of the first UltraMix guess

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.000
what it was successful enough that's right and UltraMix 2 is probably

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:25.640
destined for the platinum hits soon enough as well so that's pretty much one

01:14:25.640 --> 01:14:28.660
can make it then UltraMix 2 should be platinum by the end of the year

01:14:28.660 --> 01:14:32.400
absolutely although you know it was interesting I've been um I've been

01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:36.500
really into this website lately for video games it's one up calm I don't know

01:14:36.500 --> 01:14:41.180
if you guys have heard of this, 1UP.com, because they have a lot of the, it's very fan-oriented

01:14:41.180 --> 01:14:44.420
where you can have your own blogger and you can have a club. We actually have an Orange

01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.860
Lounge Radio Club over on 1UP.com that Rice Princess started, so I'll have to put the

01:14:48.860 --> 01:14:51.900
link in the chatroom for that, for those of you guys who haven't seen that yet, the Orange

01:14:51.900 --> 01:14:57.960
Lounge Radio Club. There was, they also show how games are ranked, like you know, the ranking

01:14:57.960 --> 01:15:03.980
for various games, and I was surprised because I have in every Xbox title that I own, and

01:15:03.980 --> 01:15:07.860
And Ultramix 2 is like the lowest ranked one on the list and I was kind of like that's

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:10.820
so sad because it's such a great game.

01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:13.100
It's really a gem of a title.

01:15:13.100 --> 01:15:18.240
It is but then again you know a place like that when fans come to congregate it's going

01:15:18.240 --> 01:15:23.740
to be a lot of the casual fans and of course games like Halo and Gran Turismo and Grand

01:15:23.740 --> 01:15:27.180
Theft Auto and Metal Gear they're all going to be in the top rank.

01:15:27.180 --> 01:15:31.860
Well exactly if you look at the top 3 right now it's Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, Halo

01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:36.860
and The Legend of Zelda, the brand new one, because of that, you know, trailer that came out this week.

01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:41.860
The Legend of Zelda shocked me, but, uh, I saw that, though, that was a very good trailer.

01:15:41.860 --> 01:15:45.860
Yeah, remember the trailer that came out this week? Oh my God, how many of you guys saw the Zelda trailer this week?

01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.860
I haven't yet.

01:15:47.860 --> 01:15:48.860
I'm gonna show it to you.

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:49.860
I've been too busy.

01:15:49.860 --> 01:15:55.860
After the show tonight, I have to show it to you. It is, it will just make you tingle in places you didn't know could tingle.

01:15:55.860 --> 01:15:56.860
Ooh!

01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:02.860
Two words can describe the, uh, trailer. Holy and, uh, what's the other one? Yeah, crap. Holy crap.

01:16:02.860 --> 01:16:06.860
Or other various explicitives that you might be able to pick up.

01:16:06.860 --> 01:16:11.860
Oh, of course. Including, uh, the omission of bodily functions that I think I'll just stop there on.

01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:12.860
What, Darkseeker?

01:16:12.860 --> 01:16:15.860
Explicitives? Don't you mean explicitives?

01:16:15.860 --> 01:16:17.860
Yeah, explicitives.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:21.860
I'm going to add that to the dictionary of Rob.

01:16:21.860 --> 01:16:26.180
This is why I'm on internet radio, boys and girls, because, you know, these things...

01:16:26.180 --> 01:16:29.580
I can't get into real radio. I can never break into real radio because my

01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:30.640
pronunciation probably...

01:16:30.640 --> 01:16:33.740
Yes, that was a new song by Britney Spears that was

01:16:33.740 --> 01:16:37.940
TOKESIC here on... Put the wrong emphasis on the wrong

01:16:37.940 --> 01:16:44.180
syllables, guy. Need to work on that. Oh, well, I'm learning.

01:16:44.180 --> 01:16:47.340
Alright, anything else you want to share with us, El Mullet?

01:16:47.340 --> 01:16:50.820
Well, if you see a piece of

01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:54.140
a little down the line on in the groove on our site

01:16:54.140 --> 01:16:58.020
I'll be responsible for that who I can't wait to see that

01:16:58.020 --> 01:17:01.060
that's all I'm going to say on it knowing that you wrote it

01:17:01.060 --> 01:17:05.900
makes me very excited what it is and in what capacity I'm not liberty to say at

01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.400
this point

01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:09.460
all right all right sounds good

01:17:09.460 --> 01:17:12.660
I'll be looking for it. Talk to you later, Sky. Have a good one, Mullet.

01:17:12.660 --> 01:17:16.780
You too. Later. Alright, let's go to the next call. Gosh, we're just getting

01:17:16.780 --> 01:17:19.040
back-to-back-to-back calls tonight. I'm trying to get everyone in.

01:17:19.040 --> 01:17:20.640
Hi, you're on Orange Longs Radio.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:23.240
Hey, hey, hey, it's Ronma from New York. How you guys doing?

01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:25.240
Good, Ronma from New York. How you doing?

01:17:25.240 --> 01:17:28.640
I'm doing pretty good. Glad to hear you guys one more time.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:31.040
Yeah, it's good to have you calling in. What's on your mind tonight?

01:17:31.040 --> 01:17:35.240
Not much. I've been telling Dark Sakura for a while. I had a little surprise for her.

01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.440
Ooh.

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:39.640
I'm posting the links now in the chat room.

01:17:39.640 --> 01:17:42.840
Okay. I'm gonna bring them up on the computer over here.

01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:45.840
Or do you have them on the... You can get them on your laptop over there, right, Dark Sakura?

01:17:45.840 --> 01:17:46.840
Yeah, I'm looking.

01:17:46.840 --> 01:17:48.680
Okay, I'm putting him in too because I want to see what it is.

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:54.480
So DJ Aramayas posting this in our chat room over at orangeloungelaungeradio.com, clicking on chat, and...

01:17:54.480 --> 01:17:56.320
Oh, is that a picture of you, buddy?

01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.000
Yeah, and you're...

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.640
You're kicking an Ultracade machine!

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.480
Yes!

01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.800
That's awesome!

01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:04.880
That is going to go in our...

01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:08.480
If you don't mind, we want to put that in our Orange Lounge Radio photo gallery.

01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:09.680
Go right ahead!

01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:16.360
I think we need to start a photo gallery on orangelaungeradio.com of people kicking Ultracade machines.

01:18:16.360 --> 01:18:21.360
I like that idea. We're going to do that, and we'll even set up an email where you can email your picks.

01:18:21.360 --> 01:18:22.360
That is awesome.

01:18:22.360 --> 01:18:25.360
And you'll be the first one in there, buddy. That's great.

01:18:25.360 --> 01:18:29.360
Ain't it fair, you have an Alpine Racer 2. I miss that game.

01:18:29.360 --> 01:18:33.360
Well, if you ever come to New York, I'll bring it to the arcade where you can play it.

01:18:33.360 --> 01:18:34.360
Sounds good.

01:18:34.360 --> 01:18:35.360
Would you have my plane ticket, please?

01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:40.360
You know, actually that arcade reminds me of Miggle, kind of, for some reason. I don't know what it is.

01:18:40.360 --> 01:18:47.360
Interesting. And there's another, oh! So there's a picture of him kicking the top, and a picture of him kicking the coin slot. Awesome.

01:18:47.360 --> 01:18:48.360
That is so nice.

01:18:48.360 --> 01:18:54.360
I was trying to go for a, um, a better kick, but manager came by, we just kinda hightailed out of there.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:19:04.360
Now, now, everybody out there, before I encourage you to run out there and kick all the Ultra Kade machines in the planet, be careful, okay?

01:19:04.360 --> 01:19:08.360
Don't actually damage the machine because you can get in trouble for that.

01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:10.360
I don't want to get sued because somebody, you know,

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:13.360
we had recommended that you kick an UltraCade machine.

01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:16.360
If you get in trouble for kicking an UltraCade machine,

01:19:16.360 --> 01:19:21.360
I will say that I knew nothing about it, and we never told you to do anything.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:23.360
So don't get in trouble.

01:19:23.360 --> 01:19:25.360
There you go, you got the disclaimer up and running.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:28.360
Alright, sounds good. Anything else you wanted to share with us? That's great though.

01:19:28.360 --> 01:19:33.360
One more thing, I went out and bought a Donald J. Trump doll Friday night.

01:19:33.360 --> 01:19:41.360
Only in New York. What is this about? What made you decide to get a Donald J. Trump doll?

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:48.360
Well, me and my friends, we went out for dinner, and before we decided to play DDR, there's a big Toys R Us in Times Square.

01:19:48.360 --> 01:19:57.360
We went over, walked around, we found some great stuff. There's a picture in my gallery of Toys R Us misspelling Gundam with an H.

01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.360
Isn't that Toys R Us, the one that was in an episode of The Apprentice as well?

01:20:01.360 --> 01:20:05.880
Yeah, I see okay. Okay, so it's a famous Toys R Us. Mm-hmm. All right

01:20:07.080 --> 01:20:08.080
basically

01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:12.960
We got dragged over to the barbie section. We're walking around one of the guys was like check this out

01:20:12.960 --> 01:20:15.480
He picked up the doll. I was like I bought it

01:20:15.720 --> 01:20:20.280
There's a picture of me in the gallery worshiping the doll because it was like the best thing in the barbie section

01:20:20.800 --> 01:20:26.400
Wait, so they had the Donald Trump doll in the barbie section. Yes. What is that all about? That's very interesting

01:20:26.400 --> 01:20:27.680
I don't know.

01:20:27.680 --> 01:20:30.360
But it does say, it does have this one interesting quote.

01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:31.560
Hope you guys can hear it.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.060
OK.

01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:36.480
No, I couldn't hear it.

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:37.840
What was it saying?

01:20:37.840 --> 01:20:41.320
I have no choice to tell you, but you're fired.

01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:41.840
Beautiful.

01:20:41.840 --> 01:20:43.680
And to answer the question in chat room,

01:20:43.680 --> 01:20:45.720
that is Laser Park in New York City.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.320
Oh, OK.

01:20:46.320 --> 01:20:46.920
Very cool.

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:47.720
Yeah.

01:20:47.720 --> 01:20:48.280
All right.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:49.960
Well, Rama, thank you very much for the pictures.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.080
And I think you've started a new trend here on Orange Lounge.

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.420
So we're going to get on that after tonight's show doing

01:20:54.420 --> 01:20:56.280
the Ultra-Cade Kicking Gallery.

01:20:56.280 --> 01:20:58.280
Oh, I'm here to help any way possible.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:21:00.280
Alright, so get your friends to do it and take pictures of them.

01:21:00.280 --> 01:21:02.280
I plan on it.

01:21:02.280 --> 01:21:04.280
Alright, sounds good.

01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280
Alright, cool.

01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:06.280
Alright, have a good one buddy, we gotta get some more calls.

01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:08.280
Alright, take care, bye.

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:09.280
Later!

01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:12.280
Alright, one more call you guys, then we're gonna get into the Orange Lawns Radio Cage Match.

01:21:12.280 --> 01:21:14.280
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio!

01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:16.280
Legend of Zaku.

01:21:16.280 --> 01:21:20.280
Hello, Legend of Zaku. One New York call to another, what's on your mind buddy?

01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:30.280
Well, a couple of things. One, let me see, a tournament I went to this weekend and just basically drama, drama, and damage and drama.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.280
Oh boy, what tournament was this?

01:21:33.280 --> 01:21:37.280
It was a local tournament in the Bronx, you know, where I'm from.

01:21:37.280 --> 01:21:47.280
Apparently, the locals in the arcade there basically got pissed off at, you know, the people out, you know, the outside players for basically being good at them.

01:21:47.280 --> 01:21:50.080
I mean, beating the crap out of them in, you know, the tournament.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:56.080
And they got so childish that they brought like six or seven people that, you know, they were about to beat the shit out of them.

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:00.080
That's how bad, that's how hostile it was going to get.

01:22:00.080 --> 01:22:03.080
Well, you're breaking up a little bit there, buddy, but, but so...

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:08.080
...posting up right now, you'll see the locked thread that, that resulted in this...

01:22:08.080 --> 01:22:11.080
So, you're breaking up a little bit, but clarify this for me.

01:22:11.080 --> 01:22:16.080
...drama because, you know, they got, they, they, these people...

01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:19.080
I think he might be a little bit delayed here. So, so clarify this for me.

01:22:19.080 --> 01:22:25.080
Um, some folks beat some other folks up over DDR, is what you're saying.

01:22:28.080 --> 01:22:29.080
I think he's delayed.

01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:30.080
No, they were about to.

01:22:30.080 --> 01:22:31.080
Oh, okay, okay.

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:35.080
Because, you know, these people, the people here...

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:39.080
He's really breaking up there. You're really, really breaking up there, buddy.

01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:44.080
...that local particulars there, they take DDR too seriously.

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:52.880
Yeah, I mean, you know what, DDR is nothing to want to even think about beating somebody

01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:53.880
up over.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:58.140
I mean, I would say that serving people over a DDR tournament, that's okay.

01:22:58.140 --> 01:23:01.120
You can serve people, but don't beat them up.

01:23:01.120 --> 01:23:06.480
Yes, but they take, the thing is that they took it seriously as they compared, they almost

01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:12.280
made it, you know, compared it as to like a sporting event where they were just basically,

01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:17.200
distracting, embarrassing the other players, and not the regulars there.

01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:20.140
So it's kind of like, that's where the drama erupted from.

01:23:20.140 --> 01:23:23.320
And you know, the regular good players had to like, you know, show them their plays by

01:23:23.320 --> 01:23:26.060
basically showing off in order to show them how it felt like.

01:23:26.060 --> 01:23:27.120
You know what, all I have to say...

01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:30.760
They basically ignored it, you know, in the past couple of tournaments there.

01:23:30.760 --> 01:23:35.120
All I have to say about these folks that want to cause all this drama over DDR, stop giving

01:23:35.120 --> 01:23:39.040
the rest of us a bad name, honestly, stop!

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.420
Exactly.

01:23:40.420 --> 01:23:46.980
As you can see the post from DDR Freak that I gave you, a sketch, you know, who's basically

01:23:46.980 --> 01:23:51.340
almost like a household name within the community because, you know, he's one of the best in

01:23:51.340 --> 01:23:54.740
the city, if not the state or the east coast.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:58.860
He was there in attendance yesterday and he pointed out, he basically, he told them politely

01:23:58.860 --> 01:24:03.980
that he just, you know, he finds those people rude and, you know, and they basically went

01:24:03.980 --> 01:24:08.820
on rampage by insulting his group, his group of people.

01:24:08.820 --> 01:24:13.720
They insulted DPD in general, so, you know, it doesn't make sense because he was telling

01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:17.720
me this game was going to take a little bit longer than I thought it would be, but I'm

01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.720
not sure if it's going to take a little bit longer than I thought it would be.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:23.360
My friend, you're breaking up over there, so I'm going to, Zaku, I know you're still

01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:26.100
trying to talk, but we can't understand you because you're breaking up, buddy.

01:24:26.100 --> 01:24:28.720
I'm going to have to go ahead and let you go, but we'll talk a little bit more about

01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:30.000
this, so keep listening, Zaku.

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.320
I appreciate the update on the tournament, okay bud?

01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:33.320
Have a good one.

01:24:33.320 --> 01:24:37.480
I feel bad that I had to let him go, but he was just breaking up really bad there.

01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:41.480
So, I don't know.

01:24:41.480 --> 01:24:44.320
Why would you want to do this?

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:50.600
Obviously if you go to a DDR tournament, it is going to be an explicit, by the way, walked

01:24:50.600 --> 01:24:54.440
in during that phone call, so he's kind of picked up most of that call, and he's run

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:57.000
a lot of tournaments and has had to deal with some of this drama.

01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:03.720
So I know you've got something you want to share on this, but if you go to a DDR tournament,

01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:07.200
you should expect that there are going to be people there who are better than you.

01:25:07.200 --> 01:25:10.720
So why would you want to beat them up because they're better than you?

01:25:10.720 --> 01:25:15.920
Well, the thing is, I understand this is a human nature that people do not want to lose.

01:25:15.920 --> 01:25:20.520
Or people are looking out over some other dude's girlfriend or so forth.

01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:28.160
It's a lot of nonsense, but I mean, I've been through numerous tournaments myself.

01:25:28.160 --> 01:25:31.080
Maybe like 18 tournaments so far total.

01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:35.280
And never have I seen anybody fight fiscally in a tournament.

01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:40.360
But if this were true, I just tend to tell people that just grow up basically.

01:25:40.360 --> 01:25:43.720
They didn't actually do the physical fight, I clarified that, they didn't actually get

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:44.720
into a fight.

01:25:44.720 --> 01:25:45.720
Oh, okay.

01:25:45.720 --> 01:25:46.720
But, you know, get in there.

01:25:46.720 --> 01:25:47.720
Get in there.

01:25:47.720 --> 01:25:48.720
I remember.

01:25:48.720 --> 01:25:51.320
Because I remember there was one time that I saw a fight over DER.

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:52.320
Oh my gosh!

01:25:52.320 --> 01:25:55.640
That was the CCO, like, two years ago in July.

01:25:55.640 --> 01:25:56.640
That is so lame.

01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:58.680
That is so lame.

01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:01.800
What were, what were, and what was, what was the honest reason?

01:26:01.800 --> 01:26:05.400
Oh my god, you got one more perfect than me, you bastard!

01:26:05.400 --> 01:26:12.600
Oh, cause, well the thing is, at the time I was there, well the person who was playing

01:26:12.600 --> 01:26:18.600
like Demon Road got up to max unlimited, then some guy was just, you know, messing around

01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:21.560
thinking it would be okay to screw his game up.

01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:22.560
Gotcha.

01:26:22.560 --> 01:26:23.560
Yeah.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:28.360
Then, of course, the fight spilled coke over the DDR pads in the group, well now the in

01:26:28.360 --> 01:26:29.360
the group pads.

01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:30.360
Right.

01:26:30.360 --> 01:26:42.360
I set your ass on fire.

01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:47.360
I set your ass on fire.

01:26:47.360 --> 01:26:51.360
So it's, you can start drama if you want to die.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:55.360
That'd be cool. I need an excuse to set people on fire, you know.

01:26:55.360 --> 01:27:00.400
well said you like the fire I know that all right we're gonna get into the

01:27:00.400 --> 01:27:03.080

Hamasaki was the winner with a system F remix of a song called kind of yeah okay

01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.780
So that's the song that Dark Sacra picked. Yeah, sounds like gonorrhea, but it's kind of yeah

01:28:22.000 --> 01:28:27.180
All right, but it's actually this song is much much better than gonorrhea could ever be so we're gonna get into that

01:28:27.980 --> 01:28:32.420
Here it is a clip of song number one. You only get to hear a clip because it was last week's winner

01:30:26.580 --> 01:30:27.980
Loki, what did you pick first tonight?

01:30:27.980 --> 01:30:35.980
Another song, it's a remix of Xenon. It's Xenon the halogen mix and it's done by T-Drop.

01:30:35.980 --> 01:30:39.980
I found it has some like video game mix set or something.

01:30:39.980 --> 01:30:46.980
Alright, so here it is, a remix of Xenon as song number two tonight in the cage match. Enjoy!

01:34:09.980 --> 01:34:11.980
Oh

01:35:09.980 --> 01:35:33.900
Alrighty, that was song number two in tonight's cage match, Beat Drop with Xenon, the halogen

01:35:33.900 --> 01:35:34.900
mix.

01:35:34.900 --> 01:35:38.420
And now we're going to go around in our really bad impersonation of American Idol and tell

01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.200
you guys what we thought of that although we're not the ones who get to

01:35:41.200 --> 01:35:45.460
choose it's you guys in the chat room dark Sakura it sounded like someone took

01:35:45.460 --> 01:35:52.740
me on which is by itself a really good song and dropped it and beat it I didn't

01:35:52.740 --> 01:35:58.300
like sampling at all sound like it was good done to a telephone or Gameboy

01:35:59.500 --> 01:36:04.300
there were parts of it I thought were okay but honestly I just couldn't get

01:36:04.300 --> 01:36:10.440
passage sounding like it was done through like a phonograph speaker

01:36:10.440 --> 01:36:18.680
underwater so it gets you to explicit well it's a pretty good song I mean

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.760
there's something like dark Sakura said there's some parts I just don't feel

01:36:21.760 --> 01:36:26.920
would be necessary which is like I'll give it a six but since it's not a max

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:35.320
remix I give it I get it plus one point the seven angel it was okay I still like

01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:38.340
the original better

01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:45.780
Loki it was my last-minute pick I had another pick which is also by beat drop

01:36:45.780 --> 01:36:49.280
which is a remix of I don't even know what it was there's something from GI

01:36:49.280 --> 01:36:55.100
Joe's called mouth and it's really strange but it sounded cool and if he

01:36:55.100 --> 01:37:00.660
only made it longer it'd be even off better but um so I don't know it was

01:37:00.660 --> 01:37:06.140
just last-minute pick it sounded okay I mean I don't know I like beat drops stuff

01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:14.220
so I give it a seven me hated it three oh but I'm gonna give it a bonus point

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:19.900
for not being a max remix as well so it gets a four all right let's get in my

01:37:19.900 --> 01:37:26.020
song tonight my song is actually an old ass song but they did like this new

01:37:26.020 --> 01:37:30.500
remix of it last year so I'm gonna pick this song because the song was rad and I

01:37:30.500 --> 01:37:33.060
kind of like this new remix like it really grew on me I've been listening to

01:37:33.060 --> 01:37:38.180
it a lot of my car so and everybody out here knows this song it's a group called

01:40:18.980 --> 01:40:20.480
Want it love?

01:40:20.480 --> 01:40:26.480
Baby don't hurt me, don't hurt me, no more

01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:34.480
Yeah, yeah, yeah, what, what, love, love, what is love?

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:41.480
What, what, what, love, love, what is love?

01:40:50.480 --> 01:40:52.920
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match,

01:40:52.920 --> 01:40:58.180
had away with what is love reloaded. Let's see what the folks in the room thought of

01:40:58.180 --> 01:41:04.280
that one starting off with Dark Sakura. I'm sorry but even remixed that song still gets

01:41:04.280 --> 01:41:10.440
on my nerves just because it was so damn overplayed. Where I would give the original a five that

01:41:10.440 --> 01:41:15.440
one was slightly better so I would give it a six and a half. Just cause I heard it way

01:41:15.440 --> 01:41:22.440
too much. Explicit. Well I have to go with Dark Sakura. Yeah it's a little overplayed

01:41:22.440 --> 01:41:26.840
And this remix, I don't know, it just sounds just the same as the original for some reason.

01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:31.440
Like, not really much has been done, just because it has the reloaded sign into it.

01:41:31.440 --> 01:41:34.440
Hmm, I'll give it a 6.8.

01:41:34.440 --> 01:41:42.440
Uh, 6.8. Come on, give it an extra 0.1 so we can have a 6.9 explicit. What do you say?

01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.440
I'll give it the 0.1.

01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:47.440
And what is this gonna have to do?

01:41:47.440 --> 01:41:50.440
It doesn't matter. Alright, Angel.

01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:56.440
I liked it, um, you know, because it's 80s and stuff, I don't know.

01:41:56.440 --> 01:41:59.440
Kinda had an extra little beat to it, um...

01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:02.440
God, this mic is loud, okay!

01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:06.440
It needed to be loud, though. We've been doing some sound balancing, so that...

01:42:06.440 --> 01:42:09.440
Because we've been getting some mail on the podcast going,

01:42:09.440 --> 01:42:12.440
It's... your sound is so messed up, ah!

01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:14.440
It's kinda bad when I can hear it from over there.

01:42:14.440 --> 01:42:16.440
Hey, no, that's a good thing. I think it's a good thing.

01:42:16.440 --> 01:42:18.440
Alright, like I said, 8.

01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:37.440
I love the original, however this sucked. A stronger bass drum and a stronger synth line is not a remix, it's just crap. It's the same damn song all over again.

01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:43.440
I love the original and they fucked it up. They went and made it into a hardhouse track and it's not supposed to be.

01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:50.900
It lost everything that I liked about the original and just sounds like a really shitty cover of it. So it gets a four

01:42:53.460 --> 01:42:58.900
You know what I kind of like it because that song's been kind of gone for a little while now that night at the Roxbury

01:42:58.900 --> 01:43:00.660
Is not starting out live anymore

01:43:00.660 --> 01:43:04.020
You know, so I kind of think it was time for that song to come back

01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:07.540
And what I really like about that remix is that it's under three minutes

01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:12.980
So whilst the beat in the background is a little repetitive the song knows when to quit so I kind of like that

01:43:12.980 --> 01:43:18.140
that so I like that song so I will give it an eight all right but however

01:43:18.140 --> 01:43:22.800
remember it is not up to us it's up to you guys you guys get the final say so

01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:26.180

song number two, or song number three.

01:44:13.180 --> 01:44:15.180
We'll tally them up over the next break

01:44:15.180 --> 01:44:17.700
and let you guys know the winner very soon.

01:44:17.700 --> 01:44:23.380
What I've been plugging a little bit tonight, I'm going to post it one more time in the

01:44:23.380 --> 01:44:27.260
chat room for those of you guys that haven't had a chance to look at it yet, I'm posting

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:32.660
a link to our LiveJournal community and it's actually a post in that LiveJournal community

01:44:32.660 --> 01:44:35.700
and you do not have to be a member of the community to read it, you don't even have

01:44:35.700 --> 01:44:39.540
to be a LiveJournal member, just go ahead and click on that link because what is in

01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:45.900
that is instructions on how to vote for us in the Best of Live 365 competition that's

01:44:45.900 --> 01:44:50.340
going on right now, how to get us nominated. And I know what some of you guys are thinking.

01:44:50.340 --> 01:44:54.580
Why does Orange Alliance Radio want to get nominated for one of those silly award shows?

01:44:54.580 --> 01:44:59.540
Well, because we like attention, duh. I mean, is there, I mean, Dark Sakura, can you disagree

01:44:59.540 --> 01:45:02.060
with me there? Attention's great.

01:45:02.060 --> 01:45:03.500
We are whores for attention.

01:45:03.500 --> 01:45:04.500
Yeah, absolutely.

01:45:04.500 --> 01:45:07.020
We will totally just make utter sluts of ourselves for attention.

01:45:07.020 --> 01:45:11.220
Where is the link right there for the podcast alley vote thing?

01:45:11.220 --> 01:45:14.300
Oh yes, we'll post that as well. I'll post that a little later. I want people to do this

01:45:14.300 --> 01:45:17.580
first but we'll do the podcast alley thing later because we're trying to get

01:45:17.580 --> 01:45:23.860
our podcast voted up too and we rely on you guys the OL Army to help us get the

01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:28.940
attention we so deserve and in turn we continue to do this train wreck of a

01:45:28.940 --> 01:45:33.860
show for you guys no we do appreciate the help you guys we love it actually a

01:45:33.860 --> 01:45:37.420
big thing is that we just we want to go back to the award show this year we just

01:45:37.420 --> 01:45:41.100
kind of want to I think really in doing this because you have to remember there

01:45:41.100 --> 01:45:46.280
there is all sorts of stations on Live 365. There's what, like 60,000? It's incredible,

01:45:46.280 --> 01:45:53.720
the amount of stations that are on Live 365. And for a DDR talk video game music station

01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:58.200
to get nominated, that's really cool. And I think it shows that there is an audience

01:45:58.200 --> 01:46:04.080
for this type of video game programming, where we're not talking about Madden, we're talking

01:46:04.080 --> 01:46:08.800
about Halo all the time. You know, we're talking about other video games. And you're gonna

01:46:08.800 --> 01:46:12.480
kind of notice that as, you know, the year goes on and Orange Lounge kind of slowly

01:46:12.480 --> 01:46:18.400
does this shift from just being a Bamani to Bamani and more. We just kind of want

01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.120
to show that there is a demand out there for this kind of niche. Speaking of

01:46:22.120 --> 01:46:26.320
strictly, if you want to talk a strictly Bamani based radio station, our buddies

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:28.960
over at DDR Freak, we're trying to help them out get a nomination as well.

01:46:28.960 --> 01:46:32.280
They've been really good to us this year, especially with the whole syndication

01:46:32.280 --> 01:46:35.640
everything, so we'd like to see them get a nod as well. So that is all detailed

01:46:35.640 --> 01:46:39.720
for you guys in the LiveJournal post. Also, our grandfather's station, Understation Live,

01:46:39.720 --> 01:46:44.040
we're trying to get them a nod as well. Without Understation Live, we would not be here. I

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:49.960
do not think so. All of that. So I hope you guys will consider taking a second. It's free.

01:46:49.960 --> 01:46:53.600
You guys already have to have a Live365 account to listen to this show, so you've already

01:46:53.600 --> 01:46:57.940
got everything you need. So check that out. Those of you guys that are too shy to join

01:46:57.940 --> 01:47:02.720
our chat room, just go to our LiveJournal community. It's www.livejournal.com slash

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:05.760
community slash orange lounge and there's a link right there on orange

01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:09.440
lounge.com that says community and it's like what the fourth post down just

01:47:09.440 --> 01:47:13.360
scroll down till you see the best of life 365 post and we appreciate your

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:19.640
support um okay so that's that let's talk about a little bit of sim scene

01:47:19.640 --> 01:47:23.200
news and usually this is kind of bit a joke lately what with all the sites

01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:25.760
being down but I know Loki I know there's big news you're very excited

01:47:25.760 --> 01:47:28.640
about this week so you got to tell us about this in the sim scene update I

01:47:28.640 --> 01:47:37.640
I guess. Um, anyways, um, just like a lot of fan stuff out there that's being worked on, most of the stuff, of course, you'll always find is in Japan.

01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:44.640
And you really need to, like, watch the Japanese sites, because that's where all the stuff's happening nowadays, since all the American stuff's down.

01:47:44.640 --> 01:47:51.640
And, of course, the one site whenever we're talking about Japanese stepmania, the one thing you have to bring up is Food Mix.

01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:56.640
And, yes, it was announced this week that Food Mix 2 Advanced Edition will be coming out.

01:47:56.640 --> 01:48:15.640
When? That's a good question, I don't know. But they have a few screenshots up on their site, there's a link on our front page to it, and go check it out. It looks good as ever, and I can't wait. Tons of new stuff. You know they're gonna have stuff from Diverse Systems. It's always a great package once it's put together.

01:48:15.640 --> 01:48:19.640
Some other things that I might point out in our forums in the Orange Launch Radio, I do

01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:26.640
have a link to, um, there's a theme called Pop Candy. The website that had it up originally

01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:31.680
went down, luckily I downloaded it a long ass time ago, so I hosted it for you guys.

01:48:31.680 --> 01:48:37.640
You can go download that on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, just check in the forums, you'll find it.

01:48:37.640 --> 01:48:44.320
And other than that, um, there was the Siberia theme, 2.1 got released, and for those who

01:48:44.320 --> 01:48:50.280
don't know what that is that's the step mania theme that looks sort of like the

01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:54.880
techno fiend it's the Japanese one it does look very good and I've actually

01:48:54.880 --> 01:49:00.720
switched this to my default theme I like it a lot and so definitely check that

01:49:00.720 --> 01:49:07.280
out as well other than that really there's a whole thread on the money

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:12.160
style of basically it's the fan mix watch thread and they've got a whole

01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:15.960
bunch of different ones you can go check out on there. Most of them, of course,

01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:19.000
aren't not done, but you can still download some of the songs, and they're

01:49:19.000 --> 01:49:23.920
pretty good. So check those out. And as well, they also have, um, there's a Megamix

01:49:23.920 --> 01:49:28.000
from the Food Mix soundtrack, because it's on their website, and it's password

01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.840
locked, and of course someone brute-force hacked that, and so they have the

01:49:31.840 --> 01:49:36.520
password for that as well. So you can go listen to that Megamix and check that

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:44.680
out so that's pretty much everything all right sounds good I'm I liked food mix a

01:49:44.680 --> 01:49:47.400
whole heck of a lot so I'm really excited about food mix to that sounds

01:49:47.400 --> 01:49:52.280
like you get a good addition so you know it's kind of neat because when you hear

01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:56.920
all this news about you know in the groove and neon FM and was that on dance

01:49:56.920 --> 01:50:01.480
tracks or whatever and all these kind of DDR knockoffs that are because spawning

01:50:01.480 --> 01:50:06.320
from the sim scene and you know what it and I realized in the groove is getting

01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:11.780
a lot of credit now but let's face it it started as a simc knockoff game because

01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:17.780
it is step mania basically in a box it's very interesting to see that food mix is

01:50:17.780 --> 01:50:23.080
which I believe to be the king of all this stuff is not an arcade thing

01:50:23.080 --> 01:50:27.100
it's interesting yeah if it were ever to make it to the arcade scene if they

01:50:27.100 --> 01:50:31.340
actually were to do something similar what they're doing here within the

01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:38.560
groove over in Japan with food mix I think you'll wipe the floor with in the

01:50:38.560 --> 01:50:44.200
group it would simply just topple it it's just better songs better everything

01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:51.080
better graphics it's just so much so better you know done then in the groove

01:50:51.080 --> 01:50:56.120
it's not even funny it's just you can't even compare them definitely check it

01:50:56.120 --> 01:51:02.360
out. If you haven't already downloaded FoodMix 1 and FoodMix Plus, I think you can still

01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:08.160
do that. Definitely download those. It's a huge download, so if you're on dial-up, probably

01:51:08.160 --> 01:51:13.920
not going to be able to play that, but if you're not, check it out if you haven't already.

01:51:13.920 --> 01:51:18.480
I think in our next break, maybe if we can round up some songs, we'll do some FoodMix

01:51:18.480 --> 01:51:22.240
music and maybe some other stuff too. I actually, we haven't played any In The Groove songs

01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:25.800
in a while, so I think there's actually a couple songs that are worth playing. I know,

01:51:25.800 --> 01:51:32.800
Jamie's frowning of disapproval. My poor ears. I know. There are some songs I like in In

01:51:32.800 --> 01:51:38.120
the Groove, so I'm going to play one of those. Alright, let's hear about the winner of tonight's

01:51:38.120 --> 01:51:46.960
cage match, shall we? Why not? Why not? Alright, so you guys voted and there was a pretty clear

01:51:46.960 --> 01:51:51.160
winner tonight. I've got to say I was kind of surprised by it. There's a brand new winner

01:51:51.160 --> 01:52:01.080
tonight and it's had a way what is love reloaded you know what I think they're

01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:04.280
just nostalgia whores kind of like I am because I think when that when that song

01:52:04.280 --> 01:52:07.200
started playing a lot of them were like I remember this song ever that I guess

01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:12.640
the scene from was it at night of the rock yeah neither Roxbury is I think I

01:52:12.640 --> 01:52:18.000
think I don't know I think that you know that's not you heard it a lot apparently

01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:23.000
And that song was pretty damn horrid when that movie was out, but it's been a while. I think most people have forgot it.

01:52:23.000 --> 01:52:33.000
There's a station in Mobile, I'll go ahead and name it as WABB, who when that song came out, it literally played once every 30 minutes.

01:52:33.000 --> 01:52:34.000
I kid you not.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:38.000
Wow, I would totally listen to a station that played that kind of stuff. That's awesome.

01:52:38.000 --> 01:52:45.000
Well, they've also played a bunch of crap, because at the time I think it was like the tail end of Color Me Bad, remember them?

01:52:45.000 --> 01:52:46.000
Oh, unfortunately I do.

01:52:46.000 --> 01:52:53.000
I mean, they really overplayed all the stuff that was really, you know, popular at the time, and it just drove me crazy.

01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:57.000
So it's just the fact that the song exists.

01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:04.000
But you know, every so often I'll catch it, and I'll kinda go, oh, I remember this.

01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:05.000
So I remember that song.

01:53:05.000 --> 01:53:08.000
Oh. Oh. Oh.

01:53:10.000 --> 01:53:11.000
I'll stop.

01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:35.000
Alright, let's see. So we got that. I know what else I wanted to say. I wanted to kind of give a shout out to one of our buddies. You know her as RicePrincess from Thursday Nights Outside the Box. She goes by a ton of other names though. Mojiko, Irene. She's a woman of many different names out there, but you guys know, I'm sure you guys are familiar with her.

01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:47.000
And I don't usually talk about big commercial gaming sites, but there's one in particular that I've grown quite fond of lately, and that's 1up.com. I actually really like them quite a bit. I would endorse them. They're a great site.

01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.000
We even have our own club over there. I will post the URL to that club in a little bit. I think it's, what, like Orangelandsradioclub or something like that.

01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:04.000
.1up.com. Well, there's a dash in there. Here, I got the link. I'll just post that for you guys in the chat room if you want to join the Orangelandsradioclub.1up.com.

01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:09.680
Anyway, back to Rice Princess. Not only did she start that club on our behalf over there,

01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:14.440
but she was actually named Blog of the Day. And I don't know if that was today or yesterday,

01:54:14.440 --> 01:54:19.000
but her 1UP.com blog was named Blog of the Day because she made this really big post

01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.760
about the Dear Friends concert that she went to Monday night in San Francisco, and somebody

01:54:22.760 --> 01:54:26.360
noticed and shared a little love. So we just want to say congratulations to our buddy Rice

01:54:26.360 --> 01:54:36.200
princess on being to blog of the day do you know me I am so famous all right

01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:40.080

01:54:40.080 --> 01:54:43.000
winner we got that okay I guess we're gonna do a break when we come back from

01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:57.600
We'll be back after this.

01:55:25.600 --> 01:55:27.600
Feel the tension in my head

01:55:44.600 --> 01:55:46.600
He's the green operator

01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:48.600
Pitting time on the battery up in the light

01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:50.960
We'll see what they can do,

01:56:20.960 --> 01:56:27.960
Feel you.

01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:21.960
Hey!

01:57:29.960 --> 01:57:30.960
Hey!

01:57:36.960 --> 01:57:37.960
Hey!

02:02:37.960 --> 02:02:44.960
opened

02:02:48.860 --> 02:02:56.360
with

02:02:56.360 --> 02:02:59.360
the

02:02:59.360 --> 02:03:03.800
hmm

02:03:03.800 --> 02:03:07.460
end

02:03:07.460 --> 02:03:12.700
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:03:12.700 --> 02:03:17.140
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:03:17.140 --> 02:03:23.620
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:27.260
Hi guys, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that set of mix there

02:03:27.260 --> 02:03:33.260
from some various sim file scene. I don't know how to kind of loop all that together,

02:03:33.260 --> 02:03:38.700
but what can you do? Beat Drop, er, not Beat Drop, what the hell, that was the song from

02:03:38.700 --> 02:03:43.660
the Cage Match. Starting this off was Evergreen from Food Mix, then Zodiac from In the Groove,

02:03:43.660 --> 02:03:51.980
Mirrorball, and P8107 after that, both from Food Mix as well. Loki is obsessed with this

02:03:51.980 --> 02:03:56.360
new show called Robot Chicken, which I actually watched last Sunday, actually I've been watching

02:03:56.360 --> 02:04:00.820
it every week because I think it's pretty damn funny too, but last Sunday was especially

02:04:00.820 --> 02:04:05.540
funny because they made fun of Mario Kart. Well, not really made fun, but they totally

02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:08.620
paid homage to Mario Kart. I'll let Loki explain. It was awesome.

02:04:08.620 --> 02:04:13.260
Okay, basically, Robot Chicken, for those who don't know, it's this 15-minute long show

02:04:13.260 --> 02:04:18.920
that's on Cartoon Network, Sundays at 1130, and I think they also have it repeating throughout

02:04:18.920 --> 02:04:24.260
the entire week. Yeah, it repeats at, well, I don't know if anyone's gonna be awake, but

02:04:24.260 --> 02:04:35.020
Monday at 2.30 a.m., Fridays at midnight and 3 a.m., and so you can check them out then.

02:04:35.020 --> 02:04:40.580
Their last night's, basically, anyway, so 15 minute show, it's all stop animation with

02:04:40.580 --> 02:04:49.640
toys and claymation. It's hilarious. Like, for example, week one, we had, they did a

02:04:49.640 --> 02:04:54.980
parody of like the was it the Rachel Lee Cook's public service announcement you

02:04:54.980 --> 02:04:58.520
know where this is your brain on drugs you know but it doesn't stop there you

02:04:58.520 --> 02:05:02.100
know this is your family and she's hitting stuff with you know a frying pan

02:05:02.100 --> 02:05:06.820
it's hilarious I actually say right now although it is 1130 right now on the

02:05:06.820 --> 02:05:09.380
East Coast that doesn't give you permission to stop listening to us and

02:05:09.380 --> 02:05:13.140
go watch this you can download it on bit torrent later and also they replay it I

02:05:13.140 --> 02:05:17.860
a ton so get that but for you West Coast folks you'll be able to listen to it

02:05:17.860 --> 02:05:31.860
Anyways, um, but yeah. Week one, the most memorable thing was Optimus Prime and the prostate cancer awareness video, and that was hilarious. Oh my God. Hilarious.

02:05:31.860 --> 02:05:46.860
Um, then last week, um, they did a parody of Cannonball Run, you know, for those who don't remember, Cannonball Run was the Burt Reynolds movie, um, based on the actual Cannonball races, uh, where you race across the country and it's like a no-holds-barred thing,

02:05:46.860 --> 02:05:50.200
thing and they have like all the weird teams of people and stuff so they have

02:05:50.200 --> 02:05:54.500
like all these new icons from like the 80s and stuff they had they had Vin

02:05:54.500 --> 02:06:02.820
Diesel supposedly as a character they had the ecto one speed racer Batman and

02:06:02.820 --> 02:06:08.980
Robin the guys from chips and just a bunch of other weird people and Mario

02:06:08.980 --> 02:06:13.740
and Luigi and Wario from Mario Kart and there's one scene in there where they're

02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:19.300
actually in the race and they're all, I think it's time we use the blue tortoise shell!

02:06:19.300 --> 02:06:26.300
And so they use the blue tortoise shell and it hits the guys from, what is it, it just

02:06:26.300 --> 02:06:30.120
knocks one of the cars off the road and it was hilarious. You just honestly, I cannot

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:35.200
describe it well enough, you really need to go watch the show tonight to give you a brief

02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:40.200
preview of what's going to be on. This episode's called The Deep End, it says find out what

02:06:40.200 --> 02:06:45.200
8. What happens when seven superheroes are forced to live under one roof in the real world metropol-

02:06:45.200 --> 02:06:47.200
Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

02:06:47.200 --> 02:06:51.200
Wait a minute. Wasn't this called Drawn Together?

02:06:51.200 --> 02:06:56.200
Okay, yes, maybe, but this will be better.

02:06:56.200 --> 02:07:18.200
And then catch Adam James, er, James T. Kirk, Khan, and Noonien Shing or something, and Kirk Cameron sing, Noonien sing, and Kirk Cameron at work in a pizza joint, and two Kirks, a Khan, and a pizza place.

02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:24.200
And someone's on a mission to track down Santa Claus and the Easter Bunny and kill Bunny.

02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:30.200
And lastly, go backstage for America's favorite undead reality show, Zombie Idol.

02:07:30.200 --> 02:07:37.200
So, and what's great about this show is they actually have a lot of the celebrities doing their own voices and stuff, and it, lots of work.

02:07:37.200 --> 02:07:42.200
I mean, for example, last week, Luigi, voiced by Matthew Lillard.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:51.200
Great stuff. Awesome. But really, watch the show. If you can't watch it, it's on torrentbox.com.

02:07:51.200 --> 02:07:55.200
Actually, we have some folks in the chatroom saying, I'm TiVo-ing it right now!

02:07:55.200 --> 02:08:02.200
And then I'm looking at our live listener stats, too, as this is going on. I know it's four people dropped while we were talking about Robot Chicken.

02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:07.200
So, damn you! I told you not to leave to go watch it! Damn you!

02:08:07.200 --> 02:08:11.880
Stop being cheap, buy a TiVo. I don't care if this show gets weak in its last hour.

02:08:11.880 --> 02:08:18.320
Alright. Speaking of that weak program you've come to know and love here at Orange

02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:20.160
Launch Radio, it's time to do tonight's

02:08:20.160 --> 02:08:23.700
listless segment! Yay!

02:08:23.700 --> 02:08:30.700
So you know we need some theme music.

02:08:31.200 --> 02:08:32.280
Alright.

02:08:32.280 --> 02:08:42.360
Tonight's list list everybody is going to be, the topic is, slash commands I would like

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:49.220
to see in an MMORPG, and of course this topic being spawned by the recent news about slash

02:08:49.220 --> 02:08:55.200
pizza being added into Pizza Hut, or I'm sorry, being added.

02:08:55.200 --> 02:09:01.200
The newest MMORPG, Pizza Hut, where you play as a delivery person.

02:09:01.200 --> 02:09:10.200
You have to avoid obstacles, such as dogs chasing you and throwing pizzas into, oh wait, that's Paperboy.

02:09:10.200 --> 02:09:12.200
Alright, smartass.

02:09:12.200 --> 02:09:16.200
Don't you know it? My ass is this smart. Imagine how smart my brain is.

02:09:16.200 --> 02:09:23.200
is

02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:51.720
explicit are working as one team tonight they're one mind or no not any more oh

02:09:51.720 --> 02:09:57.440
they are two separate entities now they have they have I know that's very that

02:09:57.440 --> 02:10:04.160
does sound kind of wrong all right but really funny all right let's find this

02:10:04.160 --> 02:10:06.320
all right I'm gonna kill the background music we'll bring you back later

02:10:06.320 --> 02:10:10.520
remember you guys get to vote you guys get to vote on the top three we're only

02:10:10.520 --> 02:10:14.480
creating the list so what's gonna happen is we're each gonna read off our top

02:10:14.480 --> 02:10:20.680
three and then the fun part each one of us gets to take one off of the list and

02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:26.360
then you guys in the chat room you get to vote on your favorite and as you guys

02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:30.600
are suggesting these slash commands don't forget you have to put a dot or

02:10:30.600 --> 02:10:33.960
something in front of it because if you actually try to type the slash command

02:10:33.960 --> 02:10:37.480
IRC will think you are actually trying to do a slash command and slash pizza

02:10:37.480 --> 02:10:41.600
doesn't work in MRC I hate to see so oh we've got a lot of funny ones going on

02:10:41.600 --> 02:10:45.660
in the chat room right now. Let's see what happens. Let's see if we get any matches.

02:10:45.660 --> 02:10:49.080
DarkSakura, why don't you start us off with your number 3 pick for Slash command you'd

02:10:49.080 --> 02:10:51.120
like to see in an MMORPG.

02:10:51.120 --> 02:10:53.700
My first one is Slash Window.

02:10:53.700 --> 02:10:55.340
And what does Slash Window do?

02:10:55.340 --> 02:11:02.720
It opens up like a little PIP window, where you can like, you know, like if you, instead

02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:06.240
of, cause you know, obviously they're not going to actually window Final Fantasy XI

02:11:06.240 --> 02:11:11.420
without using something that they consider illegal. You know, you should be able to

02:11:11.420 --> 02:11:17.400
access like the play online site as a window in window wait a minute you've

02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:24.000
actually come up with a practical good idea but it's not funny I'm just it

02:11:24.000 --> 02:11:26.900
doesn't have to be funny but I was I was really annoyed because usually what I

02:11:26.900 --> 02:11:33.160
have to set up my laptop to use a fake use to play I just love in our chat room

02:11:33.160 --> 02:11:35.840

slash yo mama would actually fuck your mama? Yeah. Ouch, I feel sorry for yo mama. Angel,

02:12:23.340 --> 02:12:28.340
You're number three.

02:12:28.340 --> 02:12:31.340
Slash silly string.

02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:32.340
Slash silly string.

02:12:32.340 --> 02:12:35.340
And what would slash silly string do?

02:12:35.340 --> 02:12:42.340
Enable you with the silly string can so you can, like, have a silly string fight with the rest of your party.

02:12:42.340 --> 02:12:44.340
Oh my. Let's get messy!

02:12:44.340 --> 02:12:48.340
Alright, Loki, you're number three.

02:12:48.340 --> 02:13:07.000
slash Nicole Brown Simpson and I think we know this this would um yeah this

02:13:07.000 --> 02:13:13.780
would link you to the find the real killers website out there um yeah

02:13:13.780 --> 02:13:18.700
because they're out there and loose and og Simpson is searching for them in

02:13:18.700 --> 02:13:27.140
every golf course Wow Wow Wow Wow my number three needs a little bit of

02:13:27.140 --> 02:13:32.980
explaining my number three choice is slash ab shock now I don't know if

02:13:32.980 --> 02:13:36.140
you've ever seen those infomercials for the things that you can actually like

02:13:36.140 --> 02:13:43.000
strap on your abs that are gonna give you a good abs in six weeks when I pulled

02:13:43.000 --> 02:13:46.920
my butt muscle so when you type slash abs shock it'll just you know give you

02:13:46.920 --> 02:13:49.920
that little pinch right in your abs so that you can work out while you play an

02:13:49.920 --> 02:13:55.380
MMORPG because you know everybody that plays an MMO is fat right of course yeah

02:13:55.380 --> 02:14:00.520
right no not really all right anorexic from having the lack of slash pizza all

02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:04.520
Alright, let's see, DarkSakurai, you're number two.

02:14:04.520 --> 02:14:08.520
Let me pull up the file again.

02:14:08.520 --> 02:14:10.520
I love my laptop.

02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:12.520
Slash Sim.

02:14:12.520 --> 02:14:16.520
What that does is it creates a simulacrum of yourself to go to your job.

02:14:16.520 --> 02:14:20.520
Like the Calvin clone machine.

02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:24.520
Wow. Someday, I hope. Wow, very nice.

02:14:24.520 --> 02:14:26.520
Slash Sim.

02:14:26.520 --> 02:14:37.380
explicit slash pubic hairs um is this for all the 12 and 13 year olds to play

02:14:37.380 --> 02:14:45.260
MMOs or what anybody I hope that one day what did the hell is this slash command

02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:56.620
supposed to do all right all right what this uh what this code does as well you

02:14:56.620 --> 02:15:01.580
know how people like fantasize about if it's clean if it's basically a new code

02:15:01.580 --> 02:15:10.380
without the pubic hair I see okay but some do speaking which house I wonder

02:15:10.380 --> 02:15:14.380
How did your 40 days without a boner thing go, speaking of which?

02:15:14.380 --> 02:15:18.380
Oh, by the way, I'm surviving. I got a few more days.

02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:19.380
Wow.

02:15:19.380 --> 02:15:25.380
Meaning I've not got a morning boner, or I see any attractive tits, or porno, or strip club.

02:15:25.380 --> 02:15:27.380
You'll never get a boner again.

02:15:27.380 --> 02:15:29.380
Oh, God. Don't even think about it.

02:15:29.380 --> 02:15:30.380
All right.

02:15:30.380 --> 02:15:31.380
Anyways, I'll explain that later.

02:15:31.380 --> 02:15:36.380
Angel, Angel, your number two pick.

02:15:36.380 --> 02:15:39.380
Sorry, you need a mic, don't you?

02:15:39.380 --> 02:15:46.940
Bitch slap. Now, would slash bitch slap, bitch slap you or the other player?

02:15:46.940 --> 02:15:53.540
Um, like, let's say you have somebody in your party that you don't like or isn't doing their job yet, right?

02:15:53.540 --> 02:15:57.100
Just do slash bitch slap. Alright, sounds good.

02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:01.260
Um, Loki, you're number two.

02:16:01.260 --> 02:16:04.420
I think the only appropriate thing that we're actually missing from

02:16:04.420 --> 02:16:07.500
an MMORPG is slash dingo

02:16:07.500 --> 02:16:13.320
because you know when someone really pisses you off online you really wish a

02:16:13.320 --> 02:16:14.920
dingo would go eat their baby

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:19.820
and so now you can have that thanks to our brand new dingo technology

02:16:19.820 --> 02:16:22.820
dingos can and will eat your babies

02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:29.980
my number two pick is

02:16:29.980 --> 02:16:35.780
slash Fred Durst porn video and the reason for this is because when you guys

02:16:35.780 --> 02:16:38.600
are feeling a little bit inadequate because you're staying in the house all

02:16:38.600 --> 02:16:43.340
day and playing MMORPGs you can type slash Fred Durst porn video and you

02:16:43.340 --> 02:16:45.940
could see that you can have it off a lot worse and you'll feel better about

02:16:45.940 --> 02:16:54.260
yourself all right so slash Fred Durst porn video um I typed slash Fred all

02:16:54.260 --> 02:17:02.140
right Jamie you're number one my number one is slash ID BFG anyone ever play

02:17:02.140 --> 02:17:14.940
Doom? Imagine going around Final Fantasy 11 with the BFG. Okay. Imagine gunning

02:17:14.940 --> 02:17:21.420
down anything that gets in your way with extreme prejudice. Very nice. I could just

02:17:21.420 --> 02:17:28.340
imagine right now, battering around, fuck you! Button. All right, sounds good, so

02:17:28.340 --> 02:17:33.340
IDBFG, just like the Doom days. Alright, explicit, you're number one.

02:17:33.340 --> 02:17:36.340
Go ahead, hmm. Slash TAC.

02:17:36.340 --> 02:17:42.340
Ahh, or it's TACO. We actually got corrected months ago.

02:17:42.340 --> 02:17:43.340
Yeah, TACO.

02:17:43.340 --> 02:17:47.340
So this would actually, like TACO, so this would actually play a TACO song.

02:17:47.340 --> 02:17:49.340
Yeah, some TACO songs.

02:17:49.340 --> 02:17:50.340
You know where there's some of them in my room.

02:17:50.340 --> 02:17:57.340
That's a damn good application for the slashing man. Alright, good job. Angel, you're number one.

02:17:57.340 --> 02:18:02.340
Wait, it's upside down to...

02:18:02.340 --> 02:18:04.340
Slash engulf.

02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:06.340
Ah, that made you giggle.

02:18:06.340 --> 02:18:10.340
And what, pray tell, does that do? Does it engulf your opponent in flames?

02:18:10.340 --> 02:18:14.340
Either your opponent or somebody in your party you don't like.

02:18:14.340 --> 02:18:18.340
So, engulf is the number one. Alright.

02:18:18.340 --> 02:18:21.340
Loki, you're number one.

02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:25.340
I figured this is the most needed thing in the world.

02:18:25.340 --> 02:18:32.700
slash real girl. Because some of those people, they need to realize they need to find a real

02:18:32.700 --> 02:18:42.620
girl and not masturbate to fictional women. So slash real girl, yes, that's what's needed.

02:18:42.620 --> 02:18:46.860
Alright, and my number one is slash give me a dollar.

02:18:46.860 --> 02:18:52.680
Oh, very cool.

02:18:52.680 --> 02:18:56.280
And when you type it, it will give you a dollar, but you can't overuse it.

02:18:56.280 --> 02:18:57.280
All right.

02:18:57.280 --> 02:18:58.280
So here it is.

02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:00.280

tough choice hmm slash them sorry it does kind of sound like the Sims

02:19:53.700 --> 02:19:56.820
although I guess that's kind of the idea behind it but we wouldn't want people to

02:19:56.820 --> 02:20:00.220
get confused because Americans do get a little too easily confused all right

02:20:00.220 --> 02:20:05.980

Who knew that Zaku could say something funny?

02:22:35.040 --> 02:22:36.040

So send us your votes now to Skye in the chat room. That's great, you guys.

02:22:49.840 --> 02:22:55.840
All right, in the meantime, while we're tallying up the votes, we'll give you guys a couple minutes to send those votes in.

02:22:55.840 --> 02:22:58.840
We'll do a quick, quick break, and then we're going to come back with the FUs of the week.

02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:03.840
So in this break, Moonlight Shadow, because that song rocks, and we haven't heard it in a while.

02:23:03.840 --> 02:23:10.840
is, and we'll be back after this.

02:23:33.840 --> 02:23:36.840
Far away on the other side

02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:40.340
She was caught in the middle of the desert fire

02:23:40.340 --> 02:23:43.840
And she couldn't find how to push through

02:23:43.840 --> 02:23:47.340
She sang for in the evening

02:23:47.340 --> 02:23:50.840
Carried away by a moonlight shed

02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:54.340
And sang a song when breathing

02:23:54.340 --> 02:23:57.840
Carried away by a moonlight shed

02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:01.340
And though she saw what's been and when it's gone

02:24:01.340 --> 02:24:04.300
Far away on the other side

02:24:04.300 --> 02:24:07.660
He was shot six times by a man on the run

02:24:07.660 --> 02:24:10.780
And she couldn't find how to push through

02:24:11.980 --> 02:24:14.540
I said, I said, I prayed

02:24:14.540 --> 02:24:18.460
I need you in heaven one day

02:24:18.460 --> 02:24:21.820
Going in the morning

02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:24.340
Carried away by a moonlight

02:24:24.340 --> 02:24:28.700
Checked and watched your vision burning

02:24:28.700 --> 02:24:31.180
Carrying away by the moonlight

02:24:31.180 --> 02:24:34.540
Shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat, shat

02:24:35.420 --> 02:24:37.660

That's one of my favorite promos because it's the only one you can hear Jamie clucking

02:26:34.720 --> 02:26:38.380
like a chicken.

02:26:38.380 --> 02:26:39.380
That's my favorite.

02:26:39.380 --> 02:26:45.060
Okay, let's hear who won tonight's list list, shall we?

02:26:45.060 --> 02:26:52.540
Alright, slash command you would most like to see in an MMORPG.

02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:57.100
Number three, slash Nicole Brown Simpson.

02:26:57.100 --> 02:26:59.460
I don't know what the hell you guys are thinking there.

02:26:59.460 --> 02:27:00.700
I can see why it's third.

02:27:00.700 --> 02:27:03.740
It's been to before.

02:27:03.740 --> 02:27:09.100
All right, in second place, slash IDBFG is score one

02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:10.540
for the old schoolers.

02:27:10.540 --> 02:27:11.540
All right.

02:27:11.540 --> 02:27:17.380
And in first place, slash give me a dollar.

02:27:17.380 --> 02:27:19.820
All right.

02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:20.500
There you go.

02:27:20.500 --> 02:27:22.100
So there it is.

02:27:22.100 --> 02:27:23.460
And so it is said, so it is done.

02:27:23.460 --> 02:27:25.560
So write those EverQuest 2 folks and tell them you would

02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:30.560
like to see slash give me a dollar or at least slash Nicole you guys are fucked

02:27:30.560 --> 02:27:35.440
all right I know you guys have lots of more slash ideas to post in our chat

02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:39.320
room but maybe you want to keep it down a little bit and let the folks talk

02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:45.120
about the show at hand and what's coming up next the F use of the week that's

02:27:45.120 --> 02:27:49.640
right it's time to get a little bit angry Jamie why do we have to get a

02:27:49.640 --> 02:27:56.640
little bit angry every single week. Grr. Argh.

02:28:10.640 --> 02:28:13.640
You know, F.D.A. to people who drive while they talk on their cell phones.

02:28:13.640 --> 02:28:18.480
I witnessed an accident nearly happen today because

02:28:18.480 --> 02:28:21.880
both drivers were on their damn cell phone. Just fuck them.

02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:25.720
Sorry, Rob. Well, I don't think other people should be on their cell phones, just me.

02:28:25.720 --> 02:28:30.720
So that wouldn't have happened. No. Well, you know the law is going to pass this year, so I'm looking forward to that.

02:28:30.720 --> 02:28:35.280
Um, there's also, uh,

02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:39.240
shoot, I was thinking about this earlier today,

02:28:39.240 --> 02:28:42.760
and I completely forgot what it was.

02:28:42.760 --> 02:28:53.440
Oh yeah, F you to people, and this is more of a situational F you, but when people complain

02:28:53.440 --> 02:28:59.680
about how much their life sucks yet they don't do anything about it, fuck that.

02:28:59.680 --> 02:29:06.960
You don't have a right to complain until you are actively working to remedy your situation.

02:29:06.960 --> 02:29:14.160
know you can say oh well I'm tired of being fat or something like that well

02:29:14.160 --> 02:29:19.460
you could get up and go to the gym you can eat less you know you there's

02:29:19.460 --> 02:29:25.180
something you can do about that you know oh I tired of living where I do well

02:29:25.180 --> 02:29:30.020
then if you can't do it right now save up your money work toward a goal and

02:29:30.020 --> 02:29:37.660
move you know or you know it's just even if you can't do something about it now

02:29:37.660 --> 02:29:42.780
at least make a semblance of working for it because it just seems like like

02:29:42.780 --> 02:29:52.220
there's no drive you know I don't understand that I also have a big SU to

02:29:52.220 --> 02:29:57.620
people who complain about not having money yet continue to frivolously spend

02:29:57.620 --> 02:30:01.760
on shit they don't need you know I've had to I've had to break myself of this

02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:06.920
habit too but I recognize that I don't have the you know that I don't have

02:30:06.920 --> 02:30:10.400
money because I spent it on this this this and this well now I can actually

02:30:10.400 --> 02:30:14.280
say I don't have the money to spend on it because I'm saving up to buy a house

02:30:14.280 --> 02:30:23.300
which is true I'm gonna be buying a house this year but it's also it's just

02:30:23.300 --> 02:30:27.240
again I don't understand the whole mentality of how people can bitch about

02:30:27.240 --> 02:30:34.000
something yet not do anything to remedy it you know what I mean I also big SU'd

02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:42.400
to the car wash line at Chevron today there were seven people in the damn line

02:30:42.400 --> 02:30:46.680
and the line wasn't moving so I'm gonna have to go back after the show at night

02:30:46.680 --> 02:30:50.880
and get my car washed where the water will not evaporate as quickly big SU'd

02:30:50.880 --> 02:30:54.760
not having an air conditioner but hey I'm going to have my air conditioning

02:30:54.760 --> 02:31:00.640
replaced next week. I'm doing something about it. That's been my big thing, is people who

02:31:00.640 --> 02:31:07.640
just don't do anything to fix their situation. So, I'm done.

02:31:09.040 --> 02:31:14.640
Alright, Loki's turn!

02:31:14.640 --> 02:31:20.640
First off, I'd like to say a big fuck you to Allergies, because they've been kicking

02:31:20.640 --> 02:31:27.960
my ass all week I'm just now starting to feel a little bit better but I don't

02:31:27.960 --> 02:31:31.720
think that's gonna last very long because it's allergy season and I'm

02:31:31.720 --> 02:31:37.040
affected by both mold and pollen so I'm fucked all year round pretty much like

02:31:37.040 --> 02:31:43.560
what I am at work anyway fuck you to work for being a little boring I tried

02:31:43.560 --> 02:31:49.200
making a catapult out of my pen last week and I got a little bit of ink on

02:31:49.200 --> 02:31:55.120
My finger because I guess pens don't like to be turned into catapults. Oh well so much for that and

02:31:56.000 --> 02:31:57.680
then

02:31:57.680 --> 02:32:05.040
Also, fuck you the fact that I need like I have this urge for projects even though I haven't finished other projects, and I really

02:32:05.640 --> 02:32:08.840
It's hard. It's like crack. I can't stop

02:32:08.840 --> 02:32:14.880
I just got a build crap, and I don't know why it's like I don't even use what I build

02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:17.840
It's I don't get it, but um

02:32:17.840 --> 02:32:23.840
Um, yeah, it's just some weird obsession that I have, so I just can't stop.

02:32:23.840 --> 02:32:31.040
And um, fuck you to Lindsay Lohan for acting, because you suck, and I don't really need

02:32:31.040 --> 02:32:36.040
you to, you know, why does Disney have to fucking remake every movie that they've made?

02:32:36.040 --> 02:32:38.120
Because you know what, all the remakes suck.

02:32:38.120 --> 02:32:39.120
So fuck those.

02:32:39.120 --> 02:32:44.720
Fuck, you know, it's not a mask because that sucked, and it's still being made, and I got

02:32:44.720 --> 02:32:49.440
damn screener for it and it's dirty no or actually i didn't get a screener for it but

02:32:49.440 --> 02:32:56.480
fuck i got tickets to it and i never went and saw it so it was good um and then finally fuck you the

02:32:56.480 --> 02:33:01.920
family that's suing michael jackson because i believe that they're just seeing him as an easy

02:33:01.920 --> 02:33:08.400
target to try to get money and if you actually follow the testimony there's a lot of um

02:33:08.400 --> 02:33:16.160
discrepancies, let's put it that way, in their testimony, and I hope they get sued. Oh, and

02:33:16.160 --> 02:33:19.000
another thing, I'm not sure if anyone heard about it, there was actually a news report

02:33:19.000 --> 02:33:23.640
a while back of this guy that sued, I believe it's ABC or whoever the fuck puts out that

02:33:23.640 --> 02:33:33.480
goddamn show, Fear Factor, he basically got sick and dizzy and fell into a door well from

02:33:33.480 --> 02:33:39.160
watching this show and this is suing them and there was justice being done

02:33:39.160 --> 02:33:43.920
and the judge said fuck you this is a frivolous lawsuit and threw it right

02:33:43.920 --> 02:33:47.880
back at him and didn't award him any money so at least there's some justice

02:33:47.880 --> 02:33:52.200
in this world and I'm done

02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:02.040
and F you to E online for I'm sorry not E online but E entertainment television

02:34:02.040 --> 02:34:07.420
for having those really addicting Michael Jackson trial wrap-up shows, where they actually

02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:11.900
reenact what's going on in the courtroom, because that shit is hilarious. The guy that

02:34:11.900 --> 02:34:18.480
they have play Michael Jackson is very eerie, like, identical, it's crazy. Except they drew

02:34:18.480 --> 02:34:24.300
on his nose, I'm not kidding you, it's horrible, it's like his nose is drawn on. It's disgusting.

02:34:24.300 --> 02:34:29.220
Um, and F you to house hunting, because it's a pain in the ass, and I've been kind of looking

02:34:29.220 --> 02:34:35.100
for like a new place where the new Orange Lounge Studio will be and we found five places

02:34:35.100 --> 02:34:39.360
on the internet we liked, we drove by and only liked two of them when we drove by them

02:34:39.360 --> 02:34:43.340
and one of them is in the ghetto so it's kind of a question mark although it sucks because

02:34:43.340 --> 02:34:46.640
that was by far my favorite house it was such a cute little house and a little gate and

02:34:46.640 --> 02:34:50.300
everything like I really want it and it's affordable but it's in the ghetto I'm like

02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:55.660
but I kind of want it I'm like I could get a guard dog Orange Lounge Radio coming to

02:34:55.660 --> 02:35:01.180
you live from the ghetto yes that's right we're coming to you from South

02:35:01.180 --> 02:35:07.300
Sac no it's all right we'll figure something out I'll figure something out

02:35:07.300 --> 02:35:11.900
I always do so but a house hunting sucks so if you do that and if you do just

02:35:11.900 --> 02:35:16.700
moving in general because moving sucks because can you imagine having to like

02:35:16.700 --> 02:35:22.020
clean this apartment is gonna suck it's gonna be horrible but you know what the

02:35:22.020 --> 02:35:27.180
place I lived in in Chico was worse and I made it somehow so I'll get through

02:35:27.180 --> 02:35:34.200
this all right let's get to our guest FUs starting it off with oh the marathon

02:35:34.200 --> 02:35:41.420
man himself explicit all right let's see I'd like to give an FV to work for

02:35:41.420 --> 02:35:45.020
letting me stay in the Sun for having me stay in the Sun without getting me a

02:35:45.020 --> 02:35:51.180
break at work Jesus yeah that yesterday was extremely hot and someone who was

02:35:51.180 --> 02:35:55.180
I was supposed to be giving breaks because I was working 10 o'clock in the morning till like 6 at night.

02:35:55.180 --> 02:35:58.180
Did not give me a break and everybody else got a break.

02:35:58.180 --> 02:36:04.180
Well guess what, I almost got a heat stroke and almost fainted.

02:36:04.180 --> 02:36:11.180
And F goes to a lot of depression towards this and pressure family-wise.

02:36:11.180 --> 02:36:16.180
Of course some of you know that my dad passed away like 2 years ago.

02:36:16.180 --> 02:36:17.180
Sorry to hear that.

02:36:17.180 --> 02:36:22.380
Yeah, and it's been tough, but some people are pushing me to a point where they don't

02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:24.540
even understand what I'm going through.

02:36:24.540 --> 02:36:27.300
They think it's, oh, so what?

02:36:27.300 --> 02:36:34.900
I'm like, okay, a person died two years ago, and you gotta talk trash behind his back?

02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:40.460
That really hurts, especially when I caught somebody in the cemetery trying to steal flowers.

02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:41.460
What?

02:36:41.460 --> 02:36:42.460
Yes.

02:36:42.460 --> 02:36:43.460
Oh, man.

02:36:43.460 --> 02:36:48.460
I love my woman, but this is the only way I can...

02:36:48.460 --> 02:36:50.460
Yeah.

02:36:50.460 --> 02:36:54.460
There's other ways to show your affection, other than stolen flowers.

02:36:54.460 --> 02:37:02.460
Perhaps he was bringing flowers to his newly found corpse that he was going to have sex with.

02:37:02.460 --> 02:37:03.460
It's like I give a damn.

02:37:03.460 --> 02:37:05.460
Anyway.

02:37:05.460 --> 02:37:07.460
You steal flowers in the cemetery, then...

02:37:07.460 --> 02:37:09.460
That's hella simple.

02:37:09.460 --> 02:37:13.700
Another F.V. goes to AlmostBreakingLent.

02:37:13.700 --> 02:37:16.860
Did you get a semi-wood or something?

02:37:16.860 --> 02:37:18.980
Came close, but no wood.

02:37:18.980 --> 02:37:21.020
Let's see, a friend of mine

02:37:21.020 --> 02:37:27.020
tested my ability to watch three hours of porn non-stop.

02:37:27.020 --> 02:37:29.820
I'm like, I'm gonna kill you, but then again,

02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:32.980
if I win this bet, I actually would get like a hundred bucks off of this.

02:37:32.980 --> 02:37:37.760
How are they gonna know if you got a boner or not?

02:37:37.760 --> 02:37:39.060
Well...

02:37:39.060 --> 02:37:42.180
determine on the fact that this

02:37:42.180 --> 02:37:44.760
that could be a lie

02:37:44.760 --> 02:37:47.340
yeah you know what uh...

02:37:47.340 --> 02:37:48.940
yeah i was uh...

02:37:48.940 --> 02:37:51.580
hardcore heroin addict and i quit

02:37:51.580 --> 02:37:52.980
uh...

02:37:52.980 --> 02:37:55.500
i want a hundred dollars

02:37:55.500 --> 02:37:57.820
if you guys know i'm a virgin

02:37:57.820 --> 02:38:00.140
uh... did not know about that

02:38:00.140 --> 02:38:04.380
exactly

02:38:04.380 --> 02:38:05.820
Alright, anyway, sorry Xplosive.

02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:08.780
Okay, how much time do we have? Okay.

02:38:08.780 --> 02:38:10.780
I don't want to take too long, I don't want to have to-

02:38:10.780 --> 02:38:11.740
Three seconds!

02:38:11.740 --> 02:38:12.140
Three.

02:38:12.140 --> 02:38:21.020
Okay, an F.U. goes to taxes, someone got one of the numbers wrong that's needed to file taxes,

02:38:21.020 --> 02:38:24.180
and guess what, they come up to me and give me a mail saying that's the wrong number.

02:38:24.180 --> 02:38:28.740
If I don't get the correct number, then I could've been arrested or fined a shitload of money.

02:38:28.740 --> 02:38:31.660
I'm like, what the hell, why is this the wrong number?

02:38:31.660 --> 02:38:39.660
Either the person who was coding up the, or counting the attacks, is either lazy or just being a dick.

02:38:40.660 --> 02:38:51.660
If he goes to almost being sandwiched by three cars, both two of them an SUV and one a truck behind me.

02:38:51.660 --> 02:38:57.660
You know what happens, like Dark Sakura said about people with the cell phones, yes I've actually seen that,

02:38:57.660 --> 02:39:04.660
but this time they didn't even signal while heading to the same lane, which I almost got squashed.

02:39:05.660 --> 02:39:10.660
Well, people need to learn how to drive, but to make sure this is short to be continued.

02:39:10.660 --> 02:39:12.660
Alright, Angel.

02:39:12.660 --> 02:39:13.660
As usual.

02:39:13.660 --> 02:39:32.660
Okay, to follow up on explicit FUs. FU to death because sometimes you lose people that, you know, really shouldn't have been taken away from you as far as, you know, age or what have you.

02:39:32.660 --> 02:39:40.580
and if you do the grieving process as well because it's not easy it's really

02:39:40.580 --> 02:39:50.900
not and yeah so I guess is it maybe a few to final history all right let's get

02:39:50.900 --> 02:39:58.340

02:42:55.920 --> 02:43:04.920
Aww. So, yeah, that's all that has to be said. Unless you want me to do a short, but sweet explanation of that.

02:43:04.920 --> 02:43:08.920
Um, I will leave it up to you. I don't want you to have to get into it if you don't want to.

02:43:08.920 --> 02:43:12.920
Well, you know, that one friend that I talked about at the beginning of the show passing away.

02:43:12.920 --> 02:43:17.140
And then we had a staff meeting for our show radio cough

02:43:18.660 --> 02:43:20.660
You know, right and

02:43:21.440 --> 02:43:23.640
Right before the meeting ended

02:43:24.580 --> 02:43:30.120
He the manager got really really quiet and he's like, uh, I just got a phone call

02:43:30.860 --> 02:43:32.860
Everybody goes what's wrong?

02:43:32.940 --> 02:43:37.460
My friend just got stabbed and he passed away. That's too bad. So

02:43:37.460 --> 02:43:46.060
So, yeah. That was just craptacular. Anyway, I'll shut up now and give you back the show.

02:43:46.060 --> 02:43:51.900
That's alright, that's alright. Um, okay, so, on a completely different note, and when

02:43:51.900 --> 02:43:56.500
I say completely, I mean completely different note, uh, Loki is looking up images on, I

02:43:56.500 --> 02:44:00.560
guess it's Bamani-style's image boards, and he's pulled up popin' porn? What the hell

02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:01.560
is this?

02:44:01.560 --> 02:44:02.560
No!

02:44:02.560 --> 02:44:22.560
It's back in their not-work-safe section, I just figured I'd take a look and see what's in there, and they've got a lot of not-work-safe stuff in there, and I don't know who the fuck draws this shit, honestly, but apparently there's a lot of it out there, and they've got some really, like, graphic pictures.

02:44:22.560 --> 02:44:27.840
like for example um let's see here doo-doo-doo-doo-doo now we have this one

02:44:27.840 --> 02:44:32.360
right here this is kind of a nice poet from pop and music getting ass fucked

02:44:32.360 --> 02:44:39.200
and yeah um so anyways if you want to check out some Bahmani porn that's

02:44:39.200 --> 02:44:45.440
Bahmani style image boards not work safe enjoy to those of you folks that draw

02:44:45.440 --> 02:44:50.960

huh it's a weird game but weird without the heads cut off stupid censorship it's

02:45:18.960 --> 02:45:24.440
It's funny that they have more inappropriate stuff for other children compared to the ones

02:45:24.440 --> 02:45:25.440
we have in America.

02:45:25.440 --> 02:45:26.440
Oh well.

02:45:26.440 --> 02:45:29.920
Sucks to be in Japan for that, for Resident Evil 4.

02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:33.680
Alright, we're going to go to a quick break, you guys, when we come back.

02:45:33.680 --> 02:45:36.460
Some Ask Orange Lounge, because we haven't done it in a while, so if you have a question

02:45:36.460 --> 02:45:39.760
for us, send it over private message in the chat room, and then we're also going to wrap

02:45:39.760 --> 02:45:46.760
things up you guys so we will be back after this.

02:46:09.760 --> 02:46:17.760
I stand on the lights of TV and the radio

02:46:17.760 --> 02:46:23.760
Still I can't escape the doors of doom

02:46:23.760 --> 02:46:28.760
What has happened to it all?

02:46:28.760 --> 02:46:31.760
Crazy some say

02:46:31.760 --> 02:46:37.760
Where is the light that I recognize?

02:46:37.760 --> 02:46:43.760
It's gone away But I won't cry at the end of the day

02:46:43.760 --> 02:46:53.760
There's an ordinary world Somehow I have to find

02:46:53.760 --> 02:47:00.760
And as I try to make my way To the ordinary world

02:47:00.760 --> 02:47:07.760
I will learn to survive

02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:32.760
Surrender

02:47:32.760 --> 02:47:34.760
Love the old and the holy

02:47:34.760 --> 02:47:36.760
You make me wonder

02:47:36.760 --> 02:47:38.760
Oh, lovely heart

02:47:38.760 --> 02:47:41.760
Just you can't drive me crazy

02:47:41.760 --> 02:47:45.760
And I can scream out love and hate

02:47:45.760 --> 02:47:47.760
I am

02:47:47.760 --> 02:47:50.760
Who made me relight my fire

02:47:50.760 --> 02:47:51.760
Sky high

02:47:51.760 --> 02:47:54.760
I should not dream it's real

02:47:54.760 --> 02:47:57.760
Like a desert under your sky high

02:47:57.760 --> 02:48:01.400
Chai chai, it's the best in the world, I will never

02:48:01.400 --> 02:48:04.400
Keep my hope in my heart, in my mind

02:48:06.400 --> 02:48:10.400
Chai chai, not a truth, not a dream, it's the real

02:48:12.400 --> 02:48:16.400
Chai chai, it's the best in the world, I will never

02:48:16.400 --> 02:48:46.360
Please listen to Orange Lounger.

02:48:46.360 --> 02:48:53.360
Radio? Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:49:01.360 --> 02:49:04.560
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:08.200
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:49:08.200 --> 02:49:11.960
Will Loki ever find the Tekken 5 soundtrack?

02:49:11.960 --> 02:49:15.600
Or will Jamie be forced to taunt him because she has it already?

02:49:15.600 --> 02:49:21.880
Now you can see what we talk about in the studio on breaks.

02:49:21.880 --> 02:49:24.880
Alright let's start it off with a question from MPQ.

02:49:24.880 --> 02:49:28.920
My sister thinks all Taku songs sound the same.

02:49:28.920 --> 02:49:31.380
Obviously this is unacceptable.

02:49:31.380 --> 02:49:35.240
What do I do to fix this?

02:49:35.240 --> 02:49:36.520
Chain her to a chair.

02:49:36.520 --> 02:49:38.920
I was thinking the exact same thing.

02:49:38.920 --> 02:49:45.040
And put her in one, actually better yet, put her in one of those total sensory deprivation

02:49:45.040 --> 02:49:50.040
except that all it plays is Taku music and she'll learn the subtle differences.

02:50:15.040 --> 02:50:20.620
StepMania. I was wondering if you have any tips for someone who has just started getting

02:50:20.620 --> 02:50:25.040
into it. A little bit vague because we're not sure if you're talking about like making

02:50:25.040 --> 02:50:28.240
step files or downloading. I'm assuming you're going to mean like you just are getting into

02:50:28.240 --> 02:50:29.240
it for the first time and downloading.

02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:31.400
I can probably explain this since I am a sim artist myself.

02:50:31.400 --> 02:50:33.640
All right, make it quick though explicit because we only got about ten minutes so.

02:50:33.640 --> 02:50:38.880
All right. The tips on sim files is one, select a good song that you feel like that people

02:50:38.880 --> 02:50:48.300
would enjoy and two use programs like acid or or whatever as long as you cut

02:50:48.300 --> 02:50:57.600
the track correct perfectly and three try to also use DWI I'm not sure if

02:50:57.600 --> 02:51:03.180
other dudes um DWI tutorial is online but if you need that I can just price I

02:51:03.180 --> 02:51:08.300
can probably send it to you on via AOL instant messenger time so for those who

02:51:08.300 --> 02:51:09.800
who are interested in Simphile making.

02:51:09.800 --> 02:51:12.920
So if you're into Simphile making, those are some good resources for you.

02:51:12.920 --> 02:51:16.780
If you're into Simphile playing, my advice would be go and get some of those, like, big

02:51:16.780 --> 02:51:17.780
pack songs.

02:51:17.780 --> 02:51:19.660
Like, you know, Food Mix, things like that.

02:51:19.660 --> 02:51:22.760
Go get some of those really, really well done Simphiles.

02:51:22.760 --> 02:51:25.220
Look for the high-rated stuff on BamaniStyle.

02:51:25.220 --> 02:51:30.940
Look for artists who have done a lot of songs, because artists, you know, folks that have

02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:35.360
done, you know, when I say artists, I mean, like, Stepphile background and so forth, artists.

02:51:35.360 --> 02:51:39.200
who have made a lot of songs have probably learned from their past mistakes, so they

02:51:39.200 --> 02:51:43.360
start producing really quality stuff, so look for that.

02:51:43.360 --> 02:51:47.400
It makes tests that have, like, you can get it labeled either keyboard or pad, so people

02:51:47.400 --> 02:51:53.040
do not, like, get confused that they're downloading something that isn't their type, like, a keyboard,

02:51:53.040 --> 02:51:56.680
like a person who wants to play just in the keyboard would not want something like pad

02:51:56.680 --> 02:51:57.680
and vice versa.

02:51:57.680 --> 02:52:02.480
Alright, and for the record, he was asking about the downloading part, not the creation,

02:52:02.480 --> 02:52:05.920
But hey, there's a tip for you folks who want to create too as well.

02:52:05.920 --> 02:52:07.360
We're going to help everybody out tonight.

02:52:07.360 --> 02:52:09.240
Alright, let's move on to the next question.

02:52:09.240 --> 02:52:12.560
DJ Rama S. Now this question has come up before, but we haven't talked about it in a while,

02:52:12.560 --> 02:52:15.360
so we'll humor this question again.

02:52:15.360 --> 02:52:18.200
How did Orange Lounge Radio come about?

02:52:18.200 --> 02:52:21.480
Oh, you want to tell it or should I?

02:52:21.480 --> 02:52:22.680
Why don't you?

02:52:22.680 --> 02:52:25.480
We were on the BART.

02:52:25.480 --> 02:52:27.880
Bay Area Rapid Transit.

02:52:27.880 --> 02:52:29.640
Coming back from San Francisco, I thought.

02:52:29.640 --> 02:52:36.240
We first discussed it going to San Francisco, and then we finalized it on the way back.

02:52:36.240 --> 02:52:40.740
We wanted to do the station for some time because I had a lot of fun subbing on Under

02:52:40.740 --> 02:52:47.960
Station, and basically came up with the idea of everything that day, and we were broadcasting

02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:48.960
what in a couple weeks?

02:52:48.960 --> 02:52:50.600
Yeah, didn't take long.

02:52:50.600 --> 02:52:54.960
So basically it's just, you know, we were having fun with Under Station Live.

02:52:54.960 --> 02:52:59.620
I know personally I was dying to sit behind the control panel for another show because

02:52:59.620 --> 02:53:02.000
Travis always sat behind the control panel for that show.

02:53:02.000 --> 02:53:07.840
So I kind of wanted to do one where I could sit behind the control panel just because

02:53:07.840 --> 02:53:10.720
I'd done it when I was doing college radio and stuff.

02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:11.720
So it worked out.

02:53:11.720 --> 02:53:14.720
And Jamie I knew was, you know, somebody I would want to do the radio show with because

02:53:14.720 --> 02:53:17.160
she had all that experience on her station.

02:53:17.160 --> 02:53:20.960
And also a vast knowledge of Bomani and video games in general.

02:53:20.960 --> 02:53:22.800
So it's because I have no life.

02:53:22.800 --> 02:53:23.980
She made a good partner for that.

02:53:23.980 --> 02:53:26.900
And then Loki just kind of showed up, but it worked out really good.

02:53:26.900 --> 02:53:29.540
He won a host spot for perfect attendance.

02:53:29.540 --> 02:53:30.540
He did.

02:53:30.540 --> 02:53:31.540
Alright.

02:53:31.540 --> 02:53:32.540
Um.

02:53:32.540 --> 02:53:33.540
Dark Knight.

02:53:33.540 --> 02:53:35.720
Here's a question for Orange Launch Radio.

02:53:35.720 --> 02:53:40.220
Do you think that Nintendo DS's online gimmick will be worth it?

02:53:40.220 --> 02:53:44.900
We're going to talk about this on the podcast this week, but the online gimmick-

02:53:44.900 --> 02:53:45.900
Yeah!

02:53:45.900 --> 02:53:51.140
Yeah, um, my short answer is yes.

02:53:51.140 --> 02:53:54.620
I mean Animal Crossing on the internet. Hello.

02:53:54.620 --> 02:53:58.340
Fuck yeah. PictoChat on the internet.

02:53:58.340 --> 02:54:02.820
IR Scare.

02:54:02.820 --> 02:54:06.660
That's all they can I say. That's all that I can say.

02:54:06.660 --> 02:54:12.060
Dark Tetsuya says, here's what I meant to ask. What was everyone's first cata?

02:54:12.060 --> 02:54:15.220
So in DDR, your first catastrophic song that you beat.

02:54:15.220 --> 02:54:18.460
Jamie. My favorite one?

02:54:18.460 --> 02:54:22.460
Your first. My first? Oh, my first was Hypnotic Crisis.

02:54:22.460 --> 02:54:26.460
That was my first as well. Anybody else care to share?

02:54:26.460 --> 02:54:30.460
I would say it was the same thing back then with Hypnotic Crisis.

02:54:30.460 --> 02:54:34.460
Paranoia Eternal. Fucking easy.

02:54:34.460 --> 02:54:39.460
Or if you count Paranoia Case Set and dropped out before it became Switch as a 9,

02:54:39.460 --> 02:54:43.460
or Burn to Floor in Max 2.

02:54:43.460 --> 02:54:48.420
the hell's up with that bird in the floor? Give me a break. That was weird. I remember

02:54:48.420 --> 02:54:51.280
talking about that before a long time ago on this show.

02:54:51.280 --> 02:54:55.980
I can express one I'm working on, although it probably wasn't the best choice. My Summer

02:54:55.980 --> 02:54:59.860
Love from like, Fourth Mix. My Summer Love I think was my second one, so that's not a

02:54:59.860 --> 02:55:04.700
bad one to be trying I don't think. In my opinion. Or like, um, no wait, that's like

02:55:04.700 --> 02:55:09.900
an eight, isn't it? Never mind. No, no, no. I was gonna say, uh, spin the disc, but I

02:55:09.900 --> 02:55:11.480
I don't remember what number that is.

02:55:11.480 --> 02:55:12.480
Alright.

02:55:12.480 --> 02:55:13.480
Okay, that's Nate.

02:55:13.480 --> 02:55:14.480
Never mind!

02:55:14.480 --> 02:55:16.480
Alright, we gotta get, we're gonna burn through some of these other questions real fast, so

02:55:16.480 --> 02:55:17.960
we gotta wrap up the show here.

02:55:17.960 --> 02:55:22.620
Mikolatov, Dear Ask Orange Lounge, seeing as how Sony doesn't seem to have as many ads

02:55:22.620 --> 02:55:26.860
out for its PSP, but it's got so much hype behind it, do you think that it will be as

02:55:26.860 --> 02:55:32.580
huge of a hit as the PS2?

02:55:32.580 --> 02:55:36.180
When you phrase the question that way, will it be a bigger hit than the PS2, I have to

02:55:36.180 --> 02:55:37.180
say no.

02:55:37.180 --> 02:55:39.620
I think the PS2 is just untoppable in that regard.

02:55:39.620 --> 02:55:44.240
I think it'll be a hit. I don't think the PSP is going to be a failure, like the N-Gage,

02:55:44.240 --> 02:55:50.520
but I think it'll do respectably, is my big fat opinion. Any opinions from anyone else

02:55:50.520 --> 02:55:51.520
on PSP?

02:55:51.520 --> 02:55:57.760
We've got ours. Yeah, we're going to buy ours. It's not a big deal.

02:55:57.760 --> 02:56:04.640
Price point's a little high for that. It'll be good though, I'm sure.

02:56:04.640 --> 02:56:11.640
Legend of Zaku says, what was the worst Bamani-related drama you have ever seen?

02:56:11.640 --> 02:56:20.320
MGL2. Remember MGL2? That was pretty bad when we had the guy who smashed food all over the

02:56:20.320 --> 02:56:26.180
stage and stuff, and oh my god, weeks and weeks of, yeah, weeks and weeks of web board

02:56:26.180 --> 02:56:31.780
posts after that. I just remember the local drama with certain

02:56:31.780 --> 02:56:37.000
people yeah that was I'm like come to think of it a lot of the big Bahmani

02:56:37.000 --> 02:56:46.420
drama that I remember I was directly involved I know I know there's just yeah

02:56:46.420 --> 02:56:49.900
I know when I think about Bahmani drama unfortunately I'm I think about the

02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:54.500
stuff that impacted me the most which you know the two I think who were the

02:56:54.500 --> 02:57:00.940
greatest causes I would say are no longer in the scene yeah true anything

02:57:00.940 --> 02:57:06.020
you want to share explicit you've been to several attorneys I'll let the

02:57:06.020 --> 02:57:13.060
forums explain everything sorta mm-hmm I'm not gonna say any names it's just

02:57:13.060 --> 02:57:19.020
gonna let people find out about that yeah lemon lime jump says what do you

02:57:19.020 --> 02:57:24.620
guys think of an orange lounge radio win amp skin hey if somebody wants to do one

02:57:24.620 --> 02:57:29.220
that's awesome I don't I unfortunately have no artistic skill whatsoever but if

02:57:29.220 --> 02:57:33.720
If somebody wants to make one and we approve of it, and we're pretty easily win-over-able,

02:57:33.720 --> 02:57:36.860
we'll put it up in our downloads section on the website. I think that would be kind of

02:57:36.860 --> 02:57:39.000
a neat thing to have, because I know a lot of people use Lamb.

02:57:39.000 --> 02:57:43.000
As long as it works with the newest version or whatever, I'm cool with it too.

02:57:43.000 --> 02:57:47.860
Yeah, it can work. Most of them do. So, any prospective artists out there that want to

02:57:47.860 --> 02:57:51.780
try that, hey, we will totally support you in that. I think it's a good idea. I never

02:57:51.780 --> 02:57:54.480
thought of that. That's a good thought.

02:57:54.480 --> 02:57:59.480
And lastly, Illusion wants to know, why are people so lame?

02:57:59.480 --> 02:58:02.020
Seriously, WTF.

02:58:02.020 --> 02:58:03.880
Why are people so lame?

02:58:03.880 --> 02:58:05.880
Their parents.

02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:07.520
Yeah.

02:58:07.520 --> 02:58:09.520
They were raised badly.

02:58:09.520 --> 02:58:10.520
Alright.

02:58:10.520 --> 02:58:16.480
Uh, that's it, gonna do it for Ask Orange Lounge tonight, we'll do it again in future

02:58:16.480 --> 02:58:17.480

02:58:57.260 --> 02:59:02.420
tell you after the show. Anyway, final thought time. Sorry guys. It kind of seems, sometimes

02:59:02.420 --> 02:59:05.580
I wish there was like a delay button that I could hit that would dump the street so

02:59:05.580 --> 02:59:10.620
I could just say it and then dump it. Anyway, some day when we're real, real radio. Angel,

02:59:10.620 --> 02:59:11.620
your final thought?

02:59:11.620 --> 02:59:17.620
Um, Nintendo DS is going to be cool. Er.

02:59:17.620 --> 02:59:20.620
Uh, explicit, your final thought?

02:59:22.620 --> 02:59:24.620
33 days and still counting.

02:59:24.620 --> 02:59:26.620
Oh, Jesus.

02:59:26.620 --> 02:59:39.620
My final thought is, yes, chat room, there will be some outside the box this week, um, because, um, we've got Lanky Style and Rice Princess back, um, and they're going to be reviewing the Dear Friends concert from this last Monday, which is why they weren't able to make it this week.

02:59:39.620 --> 02:59:44.800
this week. And there was some other stuff going on, which really exciting news, Orange

02:59:44.800 --> 02:59:49.380
Lounge Radio is going to get some nice exposure, I can't say much more than that, we'll know

02:59:49.380 --> 02:59:55.900
more as the week goes on. Uh, Loki. I better not hear any crap about next week, not this

02:59:55.900 --> 03:00:01.900
week. It's Robot Chicken, which will feature a segment called Day in the Life of Mary-Kate

03:00:01.900 --> 03:00:08.900
I was just gonna say, Jamie's being such a demobass.

03:00:31.900 --> 03:00:36.660
Alright, Jamie, in response to that, I will give you the final word of the day.

03:00:36.660 --> 03:00:37.660
Thanks you guys.

03:00:37.660 --> 03:00:38.660
See you next week.

03:00:38.660 --> 03:00:39.660
Jamie, the final word of the day.

03:00:39.660 --> 03:00:40.660
So...

03:00:40.660 --> 03:00:47.020
That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:01:05.060 --> 03:01:08.060
I grew up in San Francisco.

03:01:08.060 --> 03:01:14.060
I grew up in the midst of Polk Street, hanky code, poppers, San Francisco.

03:01:14.060 --> 03:01:16.060
So that's like my childhood.

03:01:16.060 --> 03:01:18.060
So I feel really comfortable.

03:01:18.060 --> 03:01:21.060
My parents owned a bookstore on Polk Street.

03:01:21.060 --> 03:01:26.060
And my mother was in charge of the gay porn.

03:01:26.060 --> 03:01:28.060
Which is like crazy.

03:01:28.060 --> 03:01:32.060
She would, like, pull out these books and show me to talk about it.

03:01:33.060 --> 03:01:37.060
This book, this book, this called...

03:01:37.060 --> 03:01:39.060
Ace Minister.

03:01:44.060 --> 03:01:47.060
What is the Ace Minister?

03:01:48.060 --> 03:01:51.060
What is that? I don't know where Ace...

03:01:51.060 --> 03:01:53.060
Why do you do Ace Minister?

03:01:53.060 --> 03:02:11.420
I thought this is a gay, the book for gay, because mommy don't know about the gay.

03:02:11.420 --> 03:02:20.980
The gay, they like ass, they do, they like ass so much, you know, they like ass, and

03:02:20.980 --> 03:02:31.980
but they like eggs too much. You know, you have to have eggs in moderation, you know what I mean?

03:02:31.980 --> 03:02:50.300
Because if you have an age all the time, then it's not facial.

03:02:50.300 --> 03:02:52.300
Then he's not special.

03:02:58.300 --> 03:03:00.300
You know what mommy's saying?

03:03:00.300 --> 03:03:04.300
There is a boy and his name is Paul.

03:03:04.300 --> 03:03:06.300
And mommy like Paul.

03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:11.300
He's a nice boy but he's gay and he only like two things.

03:03:11.300 --> 03:03:14.300
He like ass and Judy Garland.

03:03:14.300 --> 03:03:16.300
And that's all.

03:03:20.300 --> 03:03:23.300
And what kind of life is it like that?

03:03:24.300 --> 03:03:26.300
That's all.

03:03:27.300 --> 03:03:31.300
You know, there's the earth and the edge over the rainbow, and that's all.

03:03:32.300 --> 03:03:33.300
What kind of life?

03:03:34.300 --> 03:03:36.300
I don't know why they do this.

03:03:38.300 --> 03:03:41.300
Well, I have to look at this boo with the ace mister.

03:03:41.300 --> 03:03:45.280
I'm going to look at his book.

03:03:45.280 --> 03:03:47.280
I'm going to look at it.

03:03:47.280 --> 03:03:53.840
Look at mommy, I'm going to look at A's face for now.

03:03:53.840 --> 03:03:57.440
Look at mommy, look at mommy.

03:03:57.440 --> 03:03:59.460
A's face.

03:03:59.460 --> 03:04:23.460
I was shocked, you know, I was so shocked, it was, it was just A's right away, you know.

03:04:23.460 --> 03:04:40.460
I thought they would be table of contents, didn't they?

03:04:40.460 --> 03:04:41.460
Thank you very much everybody!

03:04:41.460 --> 03:04:42.460
You're the best!

03:04:42.460 --> 03:04:59.820
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:05:12.460 --> 03:05:14.460
You

03:05:42.460 --> 03:06:12.440
Alright, that's going to do it for Orange Laundrio tonight.

03:06:12.440 --> 03:06:18.860
you guys. Thanks so, so much for tuning in and listening and supporting us, and voting

03:06:18.860 --> 03:06:23.660

03:06:29.660 --> 03:06:33.620
is. So we appreciate that, you guys. Have a great night. What's gonna happen now is

03:06:33.620 --> 03:06:37.940
you are gonna get disconnected from the stream, but just reconnect in like 15 to 20 seconds,

03:06:37.940 --> 03:06:41.900
and you will resume hearing a bunch of DDR, 2DX, and Dance Media favorites. Have a good

03:06:41.900 --> 03:06:42.900
Go on, everybody.

03:06:42.900 --> 03:06:43.740
Good night.
