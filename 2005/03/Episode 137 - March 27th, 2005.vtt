WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:05.000
far too easily

00:05.000 --> 00:10.000
leave your tears cause I will come back

00:10.000 --> 00:17.000
I could hear that you whispered as you walked through that door

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
but still I swore to hide the pain

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
when I turned back the pages

00:25.000 --> 00:29.000
shouting might have been the answer

00:29.000 --> 00:36.000
What if I cried my eyes out and begged you not to report?

00:39.000 --> 00:48.000
But now I'm not afraid to say what's in my heart

00:48.000 --> 00:53.000
So if I and I have never been sober

00:53.000 --> 00:57.000
They'll fly to you, crossing over with time

00:57.000 --> 01:07.000
And this is holding you, suspended on silver wings

01:07.000 --> 01:12.000
And a thousand words, one thousand confessions

01:12.000 --> 01:16.000
Will cradle you, making all of the pain

01:16.000 --> 01:20.000
You'll still stay far away

01:20.000 --> 01:26.000
They'll hold you forever

01:26.000 --> 01:54.000
The dream isn't over yet Though I often say I can't forget

01:54.000 --> 02:06.000
I still relive that day, you've been there with me all the way

02:06.000 --> 02:17.000
I still hear you say, wait for me I'll write you letters

02:17.000 --> 02:23.000
I could see how you stared with your eyes to the floor

02:25.000 --> 02:29.000
But still I swore to hide the doubt

02:29.000 --> 02:32.000
When I turned back the pages

02:32.000 --> 02:36.000
Anger might have been the answer

02:36.000 --> 02:43.000
What if I'd hung my head and said that I couldn't wait

02:43.000 --> 02:55.000
But now I'm strong enough to know it's not too late

02:55.000 --> 03:00.000
Cause a thousand birds call out to the ages

03:00.000 --> 03:04.000
They'll fly to you even though I can't see

03:04.000 --> 03:08.000
I know they're reaching you

03:08.000 --> 03:13.000
Suspended or sealed away

03:14.000 --> 03:19.000
Oh a thousand words, a thousand embraces

03:19.000 --> 03:21.000
Will create a youth

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Making all of your weary days seem far away

03:26.000 --> 03:33.000
They'll hold you forever

03:33.000 --> 03:45.000
Oh, a thousand, a thousand, have never been stolen

03:45.000 --> 03:56.000
A thousand, a thousand, will carry you home

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, yeah

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
The carry on

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Carry on

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
And I can hold my arm

04:04.000 --> 04:08.000
Suspended on two away

04:08.000 --> 04:10.000
I'll sail away

04:10.000 --> 04:12.000
In a thousand moons

04:12.000 --> 04:14.000
All out through the ages

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
All through the ages

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Of great joy

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Lord of the lonely

04:20.000 --> 04:22.000
It's your only day

04:22.000 --> 04:24.000
Holy day

04:24.000 --> 04:29.000
I'll hold you forever

04:32.000 --> 04:35.000
Ohh

05:05.000 --> 05:31.000

06:42.080 --> 06:46.080
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.080
In this episode...

This is episode number 137 for this March the 27th, 2005, yes it's Easter Sunday today.

07:27.900 --> 07:31.280
We are still live though, you'd think we'd have somewhere better to be like church or

07:31.280 --> 07:34.800
something, but no we're here to provide you with three hours of entertainment on this

07:34.800 --> 07:36.460
lovely evening.

07:36.460 --> 07:38.900
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

07:38.900 --> 07:43.020
Joining me as always, my awesome, awesome co-host in this corner, the happiest bunny

07:43.020 --> 07:47.220
on the farm, say hello to Miss Jamie Sommers, you know her better as Stark, Sakura.

07:47.220 --> 07:52.020
Yeah, this is actually supposed to be a pagan fertility holiday, but oh well, blame, blame

07:52.020 --> 07:55.860
uh, those people in Italy.

07:55.860 --> 08:01.700
Yes, Dark Sakura by the way, she is, she is kind of the mother of the program, and she

08:01.700 --> 08:06.220
is, she, she'll just tell it to you like it is, honestly, but she does it because she

08:06.220 --> 08:07.600
loves you.

08:07.600 --> 08:08.600
Don't let the attitude fool you.

08:08.600 --> 08:09.600
Don't say the M word.

08:09.600 --> 08:13.600
Look, some friends of mine and Dan brought their baby to our brunch.

08:13.600 --> 08:17.600
I need a hysterectomy.

08:17.600 --> 08:22.600
Okay, the motherly, or the mother-ish?

08:22.600 --> 08:25.600
I don't know.

08:25.600 --> 08:30.600
I tried to say nice things for once, and I get shot down. Alright.

08:30.600 --> 08:36.600
Also joining us, say hello to Tech Massa, or tonight he's Lego Massa. Loki!

08:36.600 --> 08:38.600
Hi, I

08:38.800 --> 08:43.120
You know, I've got to ask what you're building, but we'll talk about it. Well when we come back. Yeah, okay

08:43.120 --> 08:46.840
Okay, are you doing on the cam though? So they can see the camera now? Well right now

08:46.840 --> 08:49.280
I'm trying to make the mess. Oh another one of those and

08:50.680 --> 08:55.700
I've been looking for this one piece and he's hunting right now ten gallons of Legos and honestly

08:56.080 --> 08:58.960
Finding four pieces and ten gallons is like a needle in a haystack

08:58.960 --> 09:02.960
I found three of the four needles, so I just need to find the last one.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.960
Can you find the marble and the oatmeal?

09:05.960 --> 09:09.960
Say hello as well to our regular guest.

09:09.960 --> 09:15.960
I can't say special guest, because damn, she's been here for the past eight weeks.

09:15.960 --> 09:18.960
She's a regular guest now. DDR Angel.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.960
Hello.

09:20.960 --> 09:21.960
How you doing, Angel?

09:21.960 --> 09:23.960
Pretty good. It's wet outside.

09:23.960 --> 09:26.960
Yes, it's raining here in lovely Sacramento where we based this show.

09:26.960 --> 09:31.960
this show, but as Jamie said to me last week, you call that a storm? Weatherwimp!

09:31.960 --> 09:38.960
Yeah. Hey, you know, all I said was it was raining outside. That was it. I didn't say

09:38.960 --> 09:45.960
it was horrible. It's just wet. Alright. It is wet, but anyway. Uh, we're high and dry

09:45.960 --> 09:50.600
in here and we've got plenty of stuff to talk about tonight. We've got, uh, some general

09:50.600 --> 09:53.960
video gaming news. Of course, your favorite segments. How was your week? How was your

09:53.960 --> 10:01.960
We're doing a giveaway tonight. We're going to give away some stuff to a lucky listener, so you're definitely going to want to be in on this and you can win a prize.

10:01.960 --> 10:04.960
And that prize is not a 10 gallon of Legos.

10:04.960 --> 10:07.960
No, it's not 10 gallons of Legos. It's something people might actually want.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.960
And we're having another guest who's currently on his way with something neat.

10:11.960 --> 10:12.960
Pie?

10:12.960 --> 10:15.960
No, dammit. Can't eat this though.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.960
Yes, your fiancé is on his way, yes?

10:17.960 --> 10:19.960
Yes, with a something.

10:19.960 --> 10:21.960
I'm excited about this. We'll have to talk about this.

10:21.960 --> 10:22.960
It's his new appendage dammit.

10:22.960 --> 10:32.600
except this is not for giving away yeah hell no all right was that the door I'm

10:32.600 --> 10:40.960

right after a quick break featuring some music this first break from 2dx night

10:45.320 --> 10:49.840

10:53.440 --> 10:56.140

21:47.680 --> 21:51.900
to us tonight as they might be for the next few weeks if for those of you guys

21:51.900 --> 21:55.820
who haven't heard yet check this out we posted the news over on www.orange

21:55.820 --> 21:59.980
launch radio.com you may remember a couple weeks ago we were saying ah life

21:59.980 --> 22:04.040
Live 365 is doing this thing where they're going to, Live 365 of course being the site

22:04.040 --> 22:08.000
that our program is hosted through, they're doing this thing where they're going to nominate

22:08.000 --> 22:12.120
people to get awards, and we did it last year, we went to the awards ceremony because we

22:12.120 --> 22:17.780
were actually nominated last year by the listeners for station, what is the station least likely

22:17.780 --> 22:20.520
to hear on AM FM radio.

22:20.520 --> 22:26.340
So we went to the ceremony, and we lost, to the, what was it, the station that played

22:26.340 --> 22:29.820
porn music all day, which certainly is- Yeah, it was the porn station.

22:29.820 --> 22:35.560
something you wouldn't hear on AM-FM radio all day, so it makes sense. So there was them.

22:35.560 --> 22:39.780
So this year, we got nominated for that award again, thanks to our listeners. Well, guess

22:39.780 --> 22:46.940
what? We also got nominated, I don't know how this happened, but we got nominated Broadcaster

22:46.940 --> 22:52.980
of the Year. Us, Orange Lawns Radio. And we have our personal ninja to thank for that.

22:52.980 --> 22:58.460
This little dorky station dedicated to video games, half the people on Live 365 probably

22:58.460 --> 23:01.900
don't even I would know three-quarters of the people on my 365 probably don't

23:01.900 --> 23:08.740
even know what DDR or bimani is DDR is the type of RAM that's what yeah that's

23:08.740 --> 23:10.900
what most people think of when they think of DDR they don't think of dance

23:10.900 --> 23:16.820
dance revolution but somehow and I know how it's our listeners it's our awesome

23:16.820 --> 23:20.220
listeners helped us out with this and thank you guys so much for taking the

23:20.220 --> 23:24.900
time to go in and nominate us somehow we got noticed and qualified for this award

23:24.900 --> 23:30.580
so we're excited as hell. So we're definitely going to the awards ceremony again. If you

23:30.580 --> 23:36.660
guys want to attend, we're going to post the information on our website. There were not

23:36.660 --> 23:43.140
a whole lot of fans last year of stations, so I think if we were not only to go ourselves

23:43.140 --> 23:46.460
but to get other people like a whole little entourage to be coming to the awards ceremony

23:46.460 --> 23:51.860
too, that would kick butt. So you can come to the awards ceremony and you can watch Dark

23:51.860 --> 23:57.220
Sakura and I drink like we did last year so it'll be fun. I need to just start

23:57.220 --> 24:01.820
doing vodka shots that way I'll be able to stay coherent longer. Yeah so actually

24:01.820 --> 24:04.180
we had a good time the award show last year so I'm looking forward to doing it

24:04.180 --> 24:08.860
again. We're certainly not expecting anything. We're nominated against some

24:08.860 --> 24:13.480
pretty powerhouse stations and broadcaster of the year. Just some really

24:13.480 --> 24:16.940
good stuff, some well-respected folks in the community, some good I think there's

24:16.940 --> 24:20.940
like a really popular rock station and a couple regular radio stations that went

24:20.940 --> 24:25.340
to the internet and I think there's an oldie station as well all really great

24:25.340 --> 24:30.940
stations so we're just like shocked that we're even in that category to take this

24:30.940 --> 24:35.220
station about video games and put it amongst these other four really really

24:35.220 --> 24:40.380
great stations it's just like damn we win the internet we totally just wanted

24:40.380 --> 24:44.500
the internet this week so we're very excited so thank you guys so much for

24:44.500 --> 24:49.740
your help of course if you want to vote for us hey we would love it so check it

24:49.740 --> 24:55.580
it out, there's a link on our website www.orangetonstray.com, there's a link there where you can go and

24:55.580 --> 25:01.180
you can vote not only for the Broadcaster of the Year, but also most likely not to hear

25:01.180 --> 25:07.740
on AMFM radio. And I think we're up against the Pokemon radio and I don't know, there

25:07.740 --> 25:12.460
was a bunch of others. The Pokemon one sticks out of my mind because I've played Pokemon

25:12.460 --> 25:18.580
and I have Pikachu dolls up here, so. Anyway, that's kind of fun. So hello to those of you

25:18.580 --> 25:23.400
guys who are new to the station. Hope you enjoy it. This is the live three hour show

25:23.400 --> 25:27.940
we do every Sunday night where we talk about not just music video games but really over

25:27.940 --> 25:31.260
the past two and a half years we've been doing it. It's just mutated into a show where we're

25:31.260 --> 25:35.660
just kind of sitting around a bunch of geeks that are into video games just talking about

25:35.660 --> 25:38.820
what's up. So we always start off the show by doing a little segment called How Was Your

25:38.820 --> 25:42.540
Week? How Was Your Day? Where we answer that question. What's up? What's going on? So we'll

25:42.540 --> 25:49.400
start off with the lovely Dark Sakura. What's up? My week, wow. Well, there wasn't

25:49.400 --> 25:53.220
really too much going on. I did a lot of exercise because I'm training for the

25:53.220 --> 26:02.000
Mud Run. I'm working out with Iguana Girl four to five times a week now. Now, what

26:02.000 --> 26:05.820
is the Mud Run, for those who don't know? The Mud Run, and I'll see if I can't post

26:05.820 --> 26:11.000
something in the chat room, like a map of it. It's a military obstacle course by

26:11.000 --> 26:15.880
Marines every year and the Marines do a five-mile obstacle course first and then

26:15.880 --> 26:20.080
it's up at the civilians. They've opened up a two-mile course which is just twice

26:20.080 --> 26:31.000
around the course. So that's what we're gonna do. It'll be pretty fun, you know, climbing over hay bales and scaling walls and swimming through a mud trench.

26:31.000 --> 26:35.000
Does the winner of this mud run, do they win immunity?

26:35.000 --> 26:45.620
however you do get a trophy and it's a you know how they do the no bags of rice

26:45.620 --> 26:51.260
or fire for this one okay you know when a phone call home or you know a chance

26:51.260 --> 26:56.900
to go out on the boat all right well that's cool good luck with that take

26:56.900 --> 27:01.140
pictures we want to see like because we need to get bio pictures for the website

27:01.140 --> 27:04.700
so we want to see a picture of you after this thing is over just looking like hell

27:04.700 --> 27:06.700
I'll give you a picture of Bio.

27:06.700 --> 27:08.700
You guys have to come. Yeah, you guys have to come watch.

27:08.700 --> 27:10.700
We'll watch, but...

27:10.700 --> 27:19.700
See, this is the ironic thing that DarkSakura, you know, she may sound like, you know, she's nice and sweet and all that, but damn, she's the toughest one here.

27:19.700 --> 27:22.700
I'm a big chicken. I could never do that mud run, so...

27:22.700 --> 27:24.700
I have chocolate.

27:24.700 --> 27:32.700
See, I'm cheating like hell today, because we went to Marie Callender's for their brunch, like we do with a group of friends of mine every year.

27:32.700 --> 27:39.700
There's some stupid drama going on now, so one person and then several more people didn't come, because one other person was going to be there.

27:39.700 --> 27:44.700
And then some friends of ours brought their baby, which convinced me never to know.

27:44.700 --> 27:47.700
Uh oh, I'll talk up.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.700
Alright.

27:49.700 --> 27:53.700
Um, Thursday Dan brought home his new appendage.

27:53.700 --> 27:55.700
Which is?

27:55.700 --> 27:56.700
The PSP.

27:56.700 --> 28:00.700
Oh, I want a PSP so bad, I hate being poor.

28:00.700 --> 28:06.700
I was really down on the PSP for a while, but now I'm really into it, because it's got that nice, wide screen on it.

28:07.700 --> 28:14.700
The games look so much better. Basically, you're carrying around the PS2, whereas with the DS, you're carrying around an N64.

28:15.700 --> 28:19.700
You know, I really think that Sony took advantage of...

28:20.700 --> 28:26.700
Well, actually, I've heard that the PSP is about the equivalent of Dreamcast power, as far as 3D's concerned.

28:26.700 --> 28:32.800
learned? You haven't played Ridge Racer then? But the games, whatever the hardware is it

28:32.800 --> 28:37.580
runs on, the games look pretty. I did check this out because I was over at your house

28:37.580 --> 28:41.860
on Thursday as well, and I was checking it out, they were playing Ridge Racer, and dang,

28:41.860 --> 28:46.180
that game was pretty. Like, it was so much better looking than I remember the PSP from

28:46.180 --> 28:53.180
E3 last year, so that was pretty cool to see. It was, oh, why thank you. It was very cool.

28:53.180 --> 28:59.180
I am very pleased with it. I played Darkstalkers. My one complaint is that it hurts my left

28:59.180 --> 29:04.180
hand when I play. Because that was on Darkstalkers. The analog button is so awesome on that one.

29:04.180 --> 29:09.700
Did you notice that I happened to notice that on the bottom left there was this little circle?

29:09.700 --> 29:13.580
I was too entranced looking at the visuals on the screen. I had no time to look at the

29:13.580 --> 29:16.660
actual system. So I was looking at it going, what's that? And you guys were like, it's

29:16.660 --> 29:27.300
your analog stick it was really cool at any rate we've been we have five games

29:27.300 --> 29:32.620
for it we have wipeout pure we have Metal Gear Solid Acid which is a strategy

29:32.620 --> 29:39.640
game so I'm like on it Ridge Racer that puzzle game was it called I want that

29:39.640 --> 29:44.160
Lou mines game how is that did you play that at all oh I've heard Lou mines

29:44.160 --> 29:47.780
something that like if you're into the music video games you know because it's

29:47.780 --> 29:51.720
by the guy who did what rez and all that stuff if you like music video games I

29:51.720 --> 30:00.380
hear Lou mines is just the poo well I I really though I've me I'm a fighting

30:00.380 --> 30:04.500
game that I had to play dark soccer so it was really awesome and the sound is

30:04.500 --> 30:09.100
really good on that thing too it doesn't sound all tinny like some things do well

30:09.100 --> 30:12.100
Oh, I should hope so with Sony putting it out and everything.

30:12.100 --> 30:17.100
Well, um, we also, though, found a web page.

30:17.100 --> 30:18.100
Can't hear you, hon.

30:18.100 --> 30:19.600
We also found something on a web page.

30:19.600 --> 30:21.100
Well, Dan found this.

30:21.100 --> 30:23.600
Where someone used Wipeout Pure, because there's

30:23.600 --> 30:26.600
a way you get onto, like, their website or something.

30:26.600 --> 30:28.600
But the website wouldn't load, and someone actually

30:28.600 --> 30:32.600
used it to get onto, uh, um.

30:32.600 --> 30:34.600
Hackaday and Slashdot.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.100
Yeah.

30:36.100 --> 30:38.600
Yes, they found a way to actually use the Wipeout

30:38.600 --> 30:45.240
website as a proxy for, um, getting on the internet. Now I've heard that, actually, one

30:45.240 --> 30:50.440
big popular thing going on on the PSP right now is loading pornography on the memory sticks,

30:50.440 --> 30:53.480
so you can have video with you to go, and of course people go straight for porn.

30:53.480 --> 30:59.520
Well, um, they actually, we actually were looking for a one gigabyte, um, memory stick,

30:59.520 --> 31:03.380
but they didn't have them anywhere where we went. GameStop is supposed to be carrying

31:03.380 --> 31:04.380
them soon.

31:04.380 --> 31:09.220
I want, if I were to get that, the first thing I'd load on would not be porn, it'd be robot

31:09.220 --> 31:10.220
chicken.

31:10.220 --> 31:14.340
We put like some video game trailers and stuff on it.

31:14.340 --> 31:18.620
And Dan of course had to have some songs on there.

31:18.620 --> 31:22.180
Like the two songs he really likes in 2DX.

31:22.180 --> 31:32.340
Which is the one from Gradius 2, Burning Heat, and Twinbee.

31:32.340 --> 31:36.720
And then I played a whole crap load of Silent Hill 3 yesterday.

31:36.720 --> 31:37.720
So probably next week.

31:37.720 --> 31:38.720
I cheated so bad.

31:38.720 --> 31:39.720
Right on.

31:39.720 --> 31:46.820
And then we went to the brunch today and I got my graphics tablet yesterday too.

31:46.820 --> 31:52.940
I have a Wacom Intuos, I think it's gorgeous, and it's so lightweight and it's like the

31:52.940 --> 31:58.380
perfect thing because I can sit back, you know, with sort of half in my lap and half

31:58.380 --> 32:04.380
hanging on my keyboard desk and I can just draw it's awesome so I'm trying to

32:04.380 --> 32:09.100
practice how to ink a little bit and then I sort of feel like I've been

32:09.100 --> 32:13.660
hanging you know hiding out under a rock for the past three years but I have

32:13.660 --> 32:17.860
finally dawned on the universe you know discovered the universe of gorillas

32:17.860 --> 32:26.220
fandom and I've gone completely bonkers. Are you talking about gorillas in the mist or

32:26.220 --> 32:28.220
No, like the band.

32:32.220 --> 32:35.220
Alright, anything else you want to share about your week?

32:35.220 --> 32:36.220
I want pizza.

32:36.220 --> 32:38.220
Alright, eat that pizza.

32:38.220 --> 32:40.220
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

32:40.220 --> 32:41.220
Uh, my week was okay.

32:41.220 --> 32:45.220
Alright, first, wait a minute, first off, I hate to cut you off, but first off, tell us what the hell you're building over there with the Legos.

32:45.220 --> 32:48.220
Which, by the way, you can see on camera right now, www.orangelsradio.com

32:48.220 --> 32:55.220
Uh, well I haven't built anything yet, because I was trying to find this goddamn piece, and I cannot find it for the life of me, I have like eight of them, and I only found three.

32:55.220 --> 33:02.220
three. And I need four. But, because I'm smart, I'll make it work. So, um, now what I'm building

33:02.220 --> 33:06.100
is, and you can find the link to this on our website, because I posted it there. It's a

33:06.100 --> 33:14.700
Nintendo DS charging dock. And it holds games and whatnot. And there's a link to the instructions

33:14.700 --> 33:22.140
on our website. Just check it out. Um, www.orangelandtraded.com. And this was posted on a bunch of different

33:22.140 --> 33:27.220
ahead. This guy made it. And it's pretty nifty. So wait, is it like with the iPod, how you

33:27.220 --> 33:32.580
have those little chargers? It's supposed to emulate that, but for a DS? Sort of. Basically,

33:32.580 --> 33:37.580
the charging cord or whatever, it just sits there and you set the DS right on top of it

33:37.580 --> 33:41.700
and away you go. And it has spots for games and stuff. So I thought, because I saw the

33:41.700 --> 33:44.520
charger over there sitting there, I was like, you know, that'd be pretty cool to put one

33:44.520 --> 33:49.580
over there and just set her DS on it. So yeah, that's what I'm building right now. God, this

33:49.580 --> 33:58.080
my hat's hot. Put this on my head. Anyways, so, yeah, that's what I did. And then throughout

33:58.080 --> 34:02.680
this week, I was supposed to hear about my job, whether I got the new one or not, and

34:02.680 --> 34:08.400
they didn't let me know because they're retarded. So, I got to wait until next week. But I'm

34:08.400 --> 34:14.120
sure I got it. Everyone's telling me that I have it, so I guess I have it. And for those

34:14.120 --> 34:18.040
of you who haven't been listening, it's a game sales position at our company. Our company

34:18.040 --> 34:21.920
is actually a video distributor and now we're going to be selling games because we bought

34:21.920 --> 34:28.080
a game company. So that'll be fun. And so that's what's going on there. Just been, you

34:28.080 --> 34:35.160
know, getting ready to move and stuff. Playing a lot of games. I spent way too much money

34:35.160 --> 34:41.840
on games this week. I've been playing a lot of God of War and some of this, I mentioned

34:41.840 --> 34:47.080
it last week, the Dog's Life where you can eat poop and throw it and stuff.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.080
That's lovely.

34:48.080 --> 34:51.080
That's all dogs do.

34:51.080 --> 34:57.080
Well, I also got Gran Turismo 4, which I just remembered after I purchased Gran Turismo 4.

34:57.080 --> 35:00.080
You know what? I didn't play much of Gran Turismo 1 when I bought it.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.080
And guess what? I haven't played much of Gran Turismo 4 when I bought it.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.080
I have a remedy for you.

35:04.080 --> 35:05.080
What?

35:05.080 --> 35:07.080
Let me bring over the Logitech wheel.

35:07.080 --> 35:08.080
Maybe.

35:08.080 --> 35:14.080
And then I also got TimeSplitters 3, because I have all three TimeSplitters games now.

35:14.080 --> 35:21.080
and, you know, you gotta love a game where you can actually drive a cat. So, um, I love

35:21.080 --> 35:26.780
TimeSplitters. 150 unlockable characters. I gotta, gotta love that game. It's just so

35:26.780 --> 35:33.320
much fun. I don't know. It's really, I think people don't really look at it as a very good,

35:33.320 --> 35:36.240
I mean, it's like a shooter. Everyone's always looking at Halo. But the best thing about

35:36.240 --> 35:41.080
this, it's actually an online game for the PS2. So I'm, gotta try the online mode with

35:41.080 --> 35:46.640
that it'd be interesting so that's what I've been doing pretty much yeah all

35:46.640 --> 35:49.920
right sounds good oh and lots of Final Fantasy level my black

35:49.920 --> 35:57.720
major 56 congratulations all right my week in my day let's see not a whole lot

35:57.720 --> 36:01.400
because we're looking for the new orange lounge studio right now at least the one

36:01.400 --> 36:04.800
that's gonna you know hold us over the next phase of orange lounge because as

36:04.800 --> 36:07.760
you know Loki and I live together and that's where we do this show right now

36:07.760 --> 36:13.080
out of this house however we're moving out at the end of April so we've put in

36:13.080 --> 36:16.400
a bit at a place and we're hoping that'll happen because if that works

36:16.400 --> 36:20.120
orange lounge will have its own room we're gonna have it kind of like the

36:20.120 --> 36:23.400
very first studio was it was his own room so that's gonna be very nice so I'm

36:23.400 --> 36:29.000
really hoping that happens also this week I went to a party last night and it

36:29.000 --> 36:32.320
was kind of one of those nerd parties although it was kind of sad because I

36:32.320 --> 36:36.760
brought my DS because I thought hey it's a nerd party so I'm gonna take my DS and

36:36.760 --> 36:39.760
we'll be able to do some wireless I was the only person there that brought a DS

36:39.760 --> 36:44.600
and then they were making fun of my carrying case which is yes the same one

36:44.600 --> 36:48.680
you bought me DDR Angel um they're making fun of the carrying case because

36:48.680 --> 36:52.120
they said it looked like a makeup case so I was you know just messing around

36:52.120 --> 36:54.880
and I would open up the case like pretend it was a makeup case and I take

36:54.880 --> 36:59.440
out the stylus and pretend to be painting my eyelashes with it so I don't

36:59.440 --> 37:01.800
know I guess it's something you have to see which doesn't work on radio the

37:01.800 --> 37:05.800
highlight of the week was watching America's top model yes the highlight of

37:05.800 --> 37:12.000
of my week was for the first time, I can't believe I've been missing this gem of a show

37:12.000 --> 37:18.120
on UPN, America's Next Top Model. It's just a bunch of bitches fighting with each other.

37:18.120 --> 37:19.120
It's so awesome.

37:19.120 --> 37:23.880
But you've got to love a show that next week has flesh-eating viruses in it.

37:23.880 --> 37:24.880
Yes, yes.

37:24.880 --> 37:25.880
You've got to love that.

37:25.880 --> 37:30.920
Seriously, I know there's a lot of hatred for reality TV out there, but damn is it entertaining.

37:30.920 --> 37:34.040
And it's certainly more entertaining than turning on the news and hearing about that,

37:34.040 --> 37:38.600
you know woman in Florida for the gazillion time I'm so over her. I forgot to mention

37:38.600 --> 37:42.380
earlier I got some new movies and I think I should mention it to Rob. We watched this

37:42.380 --> 37:48.800
one called Red Silk or whatever and it was the weirdest movie I've ever seen where these

37:48.800 --> 37:53.060
women were naked like the entire time and they were old and nasty looking and there

37:53.060 --> 37:56.760
was just like some weird dream sequences with like a kaleidoscope and stuff and it made

37:56.760 --> 38:00.420
no sense and you couldn't understand them and in fact I actually had to read the back

38:00.420 --> 38:04.640
of the box to figure out what the plot was because I couldn't figure it out from just

38:04.640 --> 38:09.240
watching it. And then, it's just, it's just really strange. But then I also got this movie

38:09.240 --> 38:18.120
called, and this is like typical fashion for me, um, it was Inbred Redneck Alien Abduction,

38:18.120 --> 38:23.200
to go with my new movie that I'm going to be getting, which is, um, what is it, uh,

38:23.200 --> 38:26.380
blood-sucking vampire rednecks.

38:26.380 --> 38:28.860
That's nice.

38:28.860 --> 38:31.660
I love bad movies.

38:31.660 --> 38:34.980
Hey, can I talk about my week again now? Yeah, go ahead. That should cut me off. Alright.

38:34.980 --> 38:39.440
So I went to the party, so nobody really had a DS, so we were playing

38:39.440 --> 38:41.020
Super Smash Brothers Melee,

38:41.020 --> 38:42.620
which is always a good time,

38:42.620 --> 38:45.860
and I'm so upset that they have not made a sequel to that game. I mean, how can they

38:45.860 --> 38:48.900
have not made a sequel to Super Smash Brothers as of yet? I played that just the other day.

38:48.900 --> 38:53.900
Why don't they have something on DS yet? Oh yeah, I forgot, the DS doesn't have any games.

38:53.900 --> 39:02.900
Um, oh well. So we played that, we played a little bit of Mario Party, which also needs to come out on the DS, although I guess they have a GBA version? I don't know.

39:02.900 --> 39:07.900
I'm so lost on the handheld loop right now, because I'm all bitter because I can't have a PSP yet, so.

39:07.900 --> 39:12.900
Alright, so that was pretty much my week of my day. Nothing else that exciting going on.

39:12.900 --> 39:15.900
DR Angel, how about you? What's up?

39:15.900 --> 39:19.900
I played Bimani this week. Ooh. Well, it's a DDR.

39:19.900 --> 39:23.900
And, uh, In the Groove. Yay. Um.

39:23.900 --> 39:27.900
You can see, what, what? What'd you think of In the Groove?

39:27.900 --> 39:31.900
We already talked about that. Small arrows.

39:31.900 --> 39:35.900
And then I noticed that, uh, oh, how do I even say that? Like, it starts off

39:35.900 --> 39:39.900
small and then it pans out kind of a thing. You know what I'm talking about?

39:39.900 --> 39:43.900
The way the arrows scroll? The weird scrolling thing it does? Yeah. Just call it the

39:43.900 --> 39:49.580
and the groovescrolling thing that makes no sense and i'm like damn you only see that though if

39:49.580 --> 39:57.100
you're like really paying attention to the arrows it's kind of funky um also let's see what else i

39:57.100 --> 40:06.140
do this week oh i got to play a different uh gamecube game this week uh what's that star

40:06.140 --> 40:08.340
uh... starfox assault

40:08.340 --> 40:09.780
it's pretty

40:09.780 --> 40:11.780
it's star foxy

40:11.780 --> 40:14.820
and uh...

40:14.820 --> 40:18.660
i don't know not not too much else

40:18.660 --> 40:23.140
i need to find my chains of promothea discs

40:23.140 --> 40:27.220
they've they've uh... sprung legs and walked away

40:27.220 --> 40:28.300
oh well

40:28.300 --> 40:31.180
i guess it's telling me not to install it again

40:31.180 --> 40:32.820
if i can't find them

40:32.820 --> 40:34.300
i'll fix it

40:34.300 --> 40:42.660
I'll find some way to play again, because I need to.

40:42.660 --> 40:46.980
Because I need to get out of the level 20 slump.

40:46.980 --> 40:49.340
Other than that, hey, nothing else.

40:49.340 --> 40:52.220
Spring break was good, and then I have to go to school again.

40:52.220 --> 40:52.720
Yay.

40:55.900 --> 40:57.180
All right.

40:57.180 --> 40:58.740
Sounds good.

40:58.740 --> 41:02.540

So you have to be either in chat or able to call us on the Skype line,

41:23.760 --> 41:27.160
because we're going to be doing a giveaway with Match Game later on tonight.

41:27.160 --> 41:30.560
So we're going to have somebody on the Skype line versus somebody in the chat room,

41:30.560 --> 41:33.840
and they're gonna be battling it out for a Resident Evil 4

41:33.840 --> 41:37.640
CD sampler of music and the ESPN

41:37.640 --> 41:42.760
NBA 2005 soundtrack. Now I know we usually don't talk about sports games a whole lot on

41:42.760 --> 41:43.720
this show but

41:43.720 --> 41:47.200
the way we see it, hey it's free music so what the heck

41:47.200 --> 41:51.240
so we're gonna give those away and then we'll throw in a little something extra

41:51.240 --> 41:51.800
as well

41:51.800 --> 41:56.760
from us the Orange Launch Radio host as well so get ready for that don't send in

41:56.760 --> 42:00.360
anything on chat room or on skype line just yet cause we'll be getting to that a little later

42:00.360 --> 42:06.540
show. I'll let you know when. Anyway, meanwhile, as of course, as you know, we do

42:06.540 --> 42:10.460
this show based out of Northern California, so we try to keep tabs on

42:10.460 --> 42:14.040
what's going on in the NorCal DDR scene. We always like hearing from you guys

42:14.040 --> 42:18.020
what's going on in your neck of the woods via the Skype line. However, we did

42:18.020 --> 42:21.740
have a large tournament that took place yesterday. It's the March Madness

42:21.740 --> 42:25.300
tournament, and I feel kind of bad because this is the very first year, I

42:25.300 --> 42:28.580
think, where I have not gone to March Madness, unfortunately. I just had some

42:28.580 --> 42:34.080
other stuff going on that day but March Madness was going on from what I

42:34.080 --> 42:39.780
understand freestyle was won by thinner Mr. Wendell which I believe is Mel B

42:39.780 --> 42:44.720
under a different pseudonym and there's actually a tie between him and 001

42:44.720 --> 42:49.960
actually picked up the freestyle winner there so good job and the reason why it

42:49.960 --> 42:54.880
was a tie because both competitors showed equal talent in the choreography

42:54.880 --> 42:59.300
an improvisation part. It was a very interesting freestyle setup. They had

42:59.300 --> 43:03.420
kind of this tiered thing where it was improv and then you went on to the next

43:03.420 --> 43:07.380
tier and it was a planned routine and then the last one you had to learn a

43:07.380 --> 43:10.820
routine. Like it was totally like America's Next Top Model all of a sudden.

43:10.820 --> 43:16.140
So in the last round they tied those. That's pretty cool. And then I haven't

43:16.140 --> 43:20.860
seen where the perfect attack scores are but I'm trying to dig through the thread

43:20.860 --> 43:25.140
right here trying to figure out what's going on looking at the wrap-up over on

43:25.140 --> 43:30.980
DDR freak the winner was Billy jr. it looks like for perfect attack with

43:30.980 --> 43:39.500
second place chaos the last round max shuffle very interesting but this is the

43:39.500 --> 43:44.260
interesting part only 24 people entered perfect attack this year which is kind

43:44.260 --> 43:48.220
of yeah it's kind of a little bit down from where it was previously so I really

43:48.220 --> 43:53.540
feel bad that I wasn't able to go. I just had other stuff going on, but is this a sign

43:53.540 --> 43:57.380
that the DDR tournaments are running out of steam? What do you think? I mean, Jamie, you've

43:57.380 --> 43:59.900
been to a lot of DDR tournaments. Do you think it's starting to run out of steam, or what's

43:59.900 --> 44:05.620
up? Honestly, yeah. I don't... I mean, I'm kind of sad that I missed out on going to

44:05.620 --> 44:12.460
this one, but, you know, March Madness has been getting a little bit smaller and smaller

44:12.460 --> 44:17.620
that I've noticed for the few years that I've been to it. What do you think? Which is too

44:17.620 --> 44:21.060
too bad because it's a really good tournament, it really is, and Mike does an excellent job

44:21.060 --> 44:27.980
putting it on. I miss the little turnies though, and I don't see as many popping up. It seems

44:27.980 --> 44:33.380
like everybody wants to have a big deal tournament these days, but the sad thing is that with

44:33.380 --> 44:38.620
Konami not really supporting DDR in the arcades, it's really starting to wear thin. I mean,

44:38.620 --> 44:43.340
I know I'm starting to feel it. Of course, in the groove now, folks are starting to move

44:43.340 --> 44:47.340
into in the groove tournaments but I mean it really depends on how you feel

44:47.340 --> 44:52.260
within the groove that game is kind of polarized the gaming dance gaming

44:52.260 --> 44:56.260
community as it is so I think a lot of folks you know if they're not into in

44:56.260 --> 44:58.940
the groove they're not gonna check out one of these tournaments so I don't know

44:58.940 --> 45:03.500
it's just kind of too bad I hope it's not a sign that DDR is dying in the

45:03.500 --> 45:08.340
arcades but at the same time without new DDR the heck are we supposed to do I

45:08.340 --> 45:12.700
don't know people are coming up with clever ideas though to keep it fresh so

45:12.700 --> 45:20.140
know, hats off to them. Loki, any thoughts on the tournament? I don't know, I haven't

45:20.140 --> 45:25.140
been in a tournament in a long time, just not my thing, I don't know. I think a lot

45:25.140 --> 45:34.780
of people are just, I don't know, just tournaments, maybe because the crowd that's getting into

45:34.780 --> 45:40.620
it now is more new at it or something, and that's why they feel maybe a little intimidated

45:40.620 --> 45:46.180
to go up against these people? Maybe that's my guess. Or the fact that these people that

45:46.180 --> 45:50.580
are coming in are getting introduced to it, like, on the home console, maybe they're just,

45:50.580 --> 45:54.620
you know, not really getting into it with the, like, environment, like the crowd and

45:54.620 --> 46:00.020
stuff as they would, you know, if they started off in the arcade. I don't know. That's my

46:00.020 --> 46:06.320
guess. Yeah, I think it's just kind of too bad. I mean, that it's just not the huge thing

46:06.320 --> 46:10.880
it was and you're right maybe a lot of those because people starting on the

46:10.880 --> 46:16.880
home mixes now but I'm surprised that I don't see more if that's the case more

46:16.880 --> 46:22.400
of these tournaments that are conducted on home mixes but maybe that's because

46:22.400 --> 46:29.600
of the fact that maybe that's because the fact that it's kind of harder to run

46:29.600 --> 46:33.280
a fair tournament on home mixes I don't know what do you guys think do you think

46:33.280 --> 46:36.280
Do you think it's possible to run a fair tournament on home mixes with home pads and stuff?

46:36.280 --> 46:38.280
Absolutely. We did it at Shaft.

46:38.280 --> 46:39.280
Yeah.

46:39.280 --> 46:44.280
When we had to do a quick fix, we pulled up modded pads and he won second place.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.280
Yeah, that's true.

46:45.280 --> 46:47.280
Hell no. Home mixes suck.

46:47.280 --> 46:53.280
By the way, the fiancée of Dark Sakura has just joined us, Dan the Man, is back.

46:53.280 --> 46:55.280
You may remember him from a couple weeks ago.

46:55.280 --> 47:00.280
He was here telling you guys to go buy ignition pads at his local GameStop.

47:00.280 --> 47:02.280
By second legendary appearance.

47:02.280 --> 47:04.720
So, did it work? Did anybody buy any?

47:04.720 --> 47:06.320
Hell no. Damn.

47:06.320 --> 47:09.280
Nobody buys the ignition pads. I think we sold one.

47:09.280 --> 47:13.500
Oh, that was from us. So to replace it, they sent me two cheap

47:13.500 --> 47:18.640
GameStop brand knock-off ignition pads. Oh, hooray. Fuck y'all.

47:18.640 --> 47:23.240
Alright, now you brought a treat to show us here in studio tonight, correct?

47:23.240 --> 47:26.000
Uh, yeah. What's that?

47:26.000 --> 47:31.760
My pants. Hooray!

47:31.760 --> 47:33.060
No, really, what'd you bring?

47:33.060 --> 47:34.060
Ooh, PSP.

47:34.060 --> 47:35.060
Is that a PSP?

47:35.060 --> 47:36.660
Ooh, we gotta put that on cam.

47:36.660 --> 47:40.060
So we'll be, we'll be showing that on cam during the break so you guys can see how pretty

47:40.060 --> 47:41.060
it is.

47:41.060 --> 47:44.660
Should we try to get some of the music on it if we can get the speakers to pick it up

47:44.660 --> 47:45.660
because it's really...

47:45.660 --> 47:47.900
We might be able to do something where we can hook into the mixing board.

47:47.900 --> 47:49.460
Well, we'll see what we can do.

47:49.460 --> 47:51.140
It's got USB connection on it.

47:51.140 --> 47:52.140
Oh, right on.

47:52.140 --> 47:53.140
Yeah.

47:53.140 --> 47:54.140
Wow.

47:54.140 --> 47:55.140
Alright.

47:55.140 --> 47:56.140
Well anyway, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna go to a break.

47:56.140 --> 48:00.400
When we come back from the break, we'll talk a little more about some news going on, um,

48:00.400 --> 48:03.520
we're going to open up the Skype line I think in the next break so get that

48:03.520 --> 48:06.680
fired up you guys not for the match game though just for you guys to be able to

48:06.680 --> 48:11.200
comment on the show if you want so far so we'll be back after this next break

48:11.200 --> 48:16.160
in this next break we're actually going to play some music from 2d x9 style but

48:16.160 --> 48:20.880
this is brand new music from the home version we call these consumer tracks so

48:20.880 --> 48:24.840
when they are made songs specifically made for the home release of the game so

48:24.840 --> 48:27.720
we're going to hear some brand new 2d x9 style songs we're going to start it off

48:27.720 --> 48:33.240
with a brand new LED song it's called photogenic so enjoy this and three other

48:33.240 --> 48:40.240
other songs and we'll be back after this.

49:03.240 --> 49:07.880
My fear is depression

49:07.880 --> 49:13.400
So I thought we'd discover dreams come true

49:13.400 --> 49:18.840
Taking you to the place with your whole dreams

49:18.840 --> 49:25.400
Open the door to tomorrow

49:25.400 --> 49:31.400
Go to hell, believe in the truth

49:31.400 --> 49:36.400
Believe in the truth

51:06.400 --> 51:18.400
This is the first time I've ever seen a man like this in my life.

51:18.400 --> 51:27.400
This is the first time I've ever seen a man like this in my life.

51:27.400 --> 51:29.400
Oh

52:27.400 --> 52:56.400
Enjoy our party, see how we play Dance till we are one, don't stop, don't

52:56.400 --> 53:02.400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

53:02.400 --> 53:09.400
See you in the next video!

53:16.400 --> 53:25.400
I can't wait to see you in the next video!

53:55.400 --> 53:57.900
It's only a long way to go

53:57.900 --> 53:59.900
This is a great deal

53:59.900 --> 54:02.400
Come on, come on

54:02.400 --> 54:05.900
Don't you look into me like I know

54:05.900 --> 54:07.400
But I can't take

54:09.900 --> 54:13.400
To get up to the valley with no love

54:13.400 --> 54:15.400
I can't take

54:15.400 --> 54:18.900
To get you without a chance to

54:18.900 --> 54:20.900
Come on

54:21.900 --> 54:23.900
Show me a diamond stick

54:23.900 --> 54:29.900
Feel it in your heart and feel it in your soul

54:29.900 --> 54:31.900
And you could say it's done for all

55:59.900 --> 56:29.300
And

56:29.300 --> 56:35.460
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of

56:35.460 --> 56:38.740
the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

56:38.740 --> 56:42.820
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More

56:42.820 --> 56:43.820
program.

56:43.820 --> 56:44.820
Can we talk about that?

56:44.820 --> 56:46.820
No subject will ever be taboo.

56:46.820 --> 56:51.540
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

56:51.540 --> 56:54.580
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

56:54.580 --> 57:00.080
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the attack music we play on the station?

57:00.080 --> 57:02.080
I collect your fucking head.

57:03.080 --> 57:05.080
Just like this fucker here.

57:07.080 --> 57:14.080
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki? The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

57:14.080 --> 57:21.080
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

57:21.080 --> 57:26.080
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

57:29.080 --> 57:33.080
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio. Hope you enjoyed that break.

57:33.080 --> 57:36.080
Some brand new music. We're playing on Orange Lounge Radio for the first time.

57:36.080 --> 57:40.080
Some tracks from 2DX Night Style, the consumer version.

57:40.080 --> 57:44.080
We had a night break. We had some LED with Photogenic.

57:44.080 --> 57:48.080
OTA2 with Usual Days, a remix there.

57:48.080 --> 57:53.360
Gupperslope with 80's Capsule and the brand new Jaeger remix which I guess is

57:53.360 --> 57:57.340
to complete some type of trilogy or something going on there so I don't know

57:57.340 --> 58:00.780
how I feel about that new Jaeger remix so because it sounds to me like it's the

58:00.780 --> 58:06.060
hamster dance. Yeah it's not very good. They need the Jaegermeister mix now. Now that would be

58:06.060 --> 58:11.180
awesome but the video is kind of cool so you know what can you do about that? All

58:11.180 --> 58:17.720
the strong Jaeger ones are pretty cool. Right. All right so what we're gonna do

58:17.720 --> 58:21.320
now is we actually we are gonna we are gonna take your calls over the skype

58:21.320 --> 58:25.040
line pretty briefly here we're gonna do that this segment and we're also gonna

58:25.040 --> 58:27.520
be doing the match game we're gonna be doing some giveaways tonight we're gonna

58:27.520 --> 58:34.320
give away some music from Resident Evil 4 and the ESPN NBA 2005 soundtrack I

58:34.320 --> 58:38.520
know we don't usually do sports games on this show but tonight we're feeling

58:38.520 --> 58:42.520
saucy it's a special night tonight we're all encompassing and because we're

58:42.520 --> 58:46.560
feeling saucy we reserve the right to change things as we go here with this

58:46.560 --> 58:52.100
program straight so I call that my influence as the resident female yeah I

58:52.100 --> 58:58.300

58:58.300 --> 59:02.820

59:05.900 --> 59:11.500
service back song pack 9 just came out for DDR ultra mix 2 so what we're gonna

59:11.500 --> 59:15.780
do is we're actually gonna have Loki play some of these songs on air and he's

59:15.780 --> 59:20.480
going to give us his feedback to the steps to these songs live as he dances

59:20.480 --> 59:23.460
to them this is our excuse because they think I'm too fat and so they said you

59:23.460 --> 59:27.900
got to work yeah I got to exercise Loki has to dance because he is the pudgiest

59:27.900 --> 59:35.820

59:35.820 --> 59:39.980

59:44.860 --> 59:47.360

Forget it. Alright.

59:48.360 --> 59:51.360
Let's bring in the ultimate two sounds.

59:51.360 --> 59:52.360
Ooh, Johnny, Johnny.

59:52.360 --> 59:53.360
Ooh, yay.

59:53.360 --> 59:54.360
Alright.

59:54.360 --> 59:56.360
You gotta find a song from Song Pack 9.

59:56.360 --> 59:57.360
Alright.

59:57.360 --> 01:00:00.360
But don't you dare play Forever Sunshine because I hate that crap.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:01.360
Gotcha.

01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:05.360
Pick a skill level.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:11.360
Now you can see the steps and the background live on cam.

01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:15.920
www.orangeloungeradio.com

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:16.800

01:00:16.800 --> 01:00:17.920
okay it's finally

01:00:17.920 --> 01:00:20.280
go to the left, it'll be faster

01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.640

01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:25.800
all right it's here

01:00:25.800 --> 01:00:28.080
regret, oh gee-ah

01:00:28.080 --> 01:00:30.040
there's um...

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:30.880
jelly

01:00:30.880 --> 01:00:34.400
tests, no you're going back into like song pack seven and stuff, go over to

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.880

01:00:35.880 --> 01:00:39.800
okay

01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:43.240
you would be disabled apply like that i'd love to see you do that one

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.560
it could be a head

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:49.480
do jelly kiss do jelly kiss warm-up all right all right

01:00:49.480 --> 01:00:51.360
supply for you to get back

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:54.160
well you know if you don't know that it's been a little while since you

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:55.360
played

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.440
all right

01:00:58.440 --> 01:00:59.480
program like this

01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:00.800
actually i was going to get it

01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:04.040
you got him with the mic with the mike oh i'll be in my opinion that the

01:01:04.040 --> 01:01:15.040
Well, for a five-footer, I mean, there's not much to expect of this one.

01:01:15.040 --> 01:01:28.040
That's five on heavy. It's pretty bad.

01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:32.040
It's kind of hard for a five-footer. It's got like offbeat notes and everything.

01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.040
Look at the duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh. It's like kind of like fast stuff.

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:46.040
This guy seems kind of hard for a five to me. I don't know what to say.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:47.040
Uh, it would be different like a six.

01:01:47.040 --> 01:01:53.040
If our listeners are watching the webcam on orangehomegordo.com, they can get a pretty good view of us and stuff.

01:01:53.040 --> 01:01:54.040
Absolutely.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:02:00.040
And just so you know, yes, my colors are all screwed up on the notes. I'll tell you why I do that after Logie finishes.

01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:06.040
It's my way of kind of like getting an edge up on Xbox Live when I play.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.040
Cheater!

01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:10.040
I'm not a cheater, I'm just exploiting something in the game.

01:02:10.040 --> 01:02:34.760
this is not a five i'm sorry that is not a five

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:49.840
7 maybe. But then again I can't really judge song difficulty anymore because like I'm out

01:02:49.840 --> 01:02:55.520
of shape. This plays about like a 7. Okay how many calories would you say you burn on

01:02:55.520 --> 01:03:03.120
that one? Oh no. I can tell you. Okay 40. Okay let's see. Let's see what kind of grade

01:03:03.120 --> 01:03:08.800
Loki got on that one. Let's see, 37 great. I'd say that's about a C. Oh, he got an A!

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:13.800
I guess I rock. Good job. Alright. Okay, so what'd you think of those steps? Eh, they're

01:03:13.800 --> 01:03:19.360
okay. They look kinda fun except that you know I hate free stuff. Alright, now you gotta

01:03:19.360 --> 01:03:23.920
do the cata. Do disable the flog. Oh god. Here, I'll hold the microphone. Alright. No,

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:27.600
make him hold the mic while he does it. No, no, no, no, no, no. I don't want him to trip.

01:03:27.600 --> 01:03:33.680
i want to be back i don't know how old i don't live

01:03:33.680 --> 01:03:35.560
there will all of the court

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.360
i promise

01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:38.080
that you on fire in general

01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:40.000
i hate you

01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:40.880
will launch that

01:03:40.880 --> 01:03:45.640
you know

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:52.640
What, this song's only like a minute ten.

01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:58.480
Whew!

01:03:58.480 --> 01:04:02.360
Don't fail. You're on the internet right now. They'll all know if you fail this crap.

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:09.360
Shut up!

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:14.560
Whew! Cool damn break.

01:04:14.560 --> 01:04:20.480
I gotta cut up some slack on this mic cord.

01:04:20.480 --> 01:04:23.480
Oh my gosh.

01:04:23.480 --> 01:04:26.640
Oh man.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.200
This is like classic Cata stuff.

01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:37.240
I love this song though. This is like a real gem in this song. I would say this is my favorite song in this song.

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:41.040
Yeah, I know, I actually saw the gem on this one.

01:04:41.040 --> 01:04:43.040
boo-boo-boo-boo-boo-boo

01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:45.040
Hey, he's just got a...

01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:47.040
You're turning around now!

01:04:47.040 --> 01:04:49.040
Thank god. Good job!

01:04:49.040 --> 01:04:51.040
I am so out of shape, I really need to go back and play.

01:04:51.040 --> 01:04:53.040
What'd you think of those steps?

01:04:55.040 --> 01:04:57.040
Is it a worthy download?

01:04:57.040 --> 01:04:59.040
You got a D.

01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.040
Shut up!

01:05:01.040 --> 01:05:03.040
D for the bum-ass.

01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:05.040
Okay.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.040
I would say, if you're out of shape like me,

01:05:07.040 --> 01:05:09.040
don't play the cat that's on a patch.

01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.040
Would you spend $5 for that? I'm going to turn down the Ultramix music there.

01:05:13.040 --> 01:05:15.040
Yeah, I would.

01:05:15.040 --> 01:05:18.040
Um, really, they're kind of stretching for songs now.

01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:20.040
Ooh, your D is on the webcam, too.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:23.040
All right.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.040
I'm done, man.

01:05:25.040 --> 01:05:29.040
All right, you're done? You sure you don't want to do one Forever Sunshine, Jamie, for us?

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:31.040
I'll do it.

01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:34.040
I'm trying to get Jamie to get up there.

01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:39.040
No, no, I'm sorry, don't play Forever Sunshine, I was totally kidding, I hate that song.

01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:43.040
No, if you play Forever Sunshine, I will cut off your ankles.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:44.040
Anyways.

01:05:44.040 --> 01:05:45.040
I like Ogia.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:46.040
Alright.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:50.040
I would have to say, um, yeah, it's worth a download.

01:05:50.040 --> 01:05:52.040
I mean, the steps are pretty good.

01:05:52.040 --> 01:05:59.040
They weren't retarded, like, say, you know, um, was it, uh, Outer Limits or anything like

01:05:59.040 --> 01:06:01.040
that, where it's just ridiculous, like, fast and stuff?

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.920
it's able to fly ahead steps sort of like your old school cat is where it's a

01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:10.200
long run of eighth notes and stuff like that pretty good alright sounds good now

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:13.680
for those of you guys that are wondering why the hell does it show the red notes

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.840
and blue notes and yellow notes why doesn't it look right because actually

01:06:16.840 --> 01:06:21.520
the way my system is set up on the Xbox I actually have it set to show the notes

01:06:21.520 --> 01:06:25.600
the different colors on purpose because the reason why I do that is so that when

01:06:25.600 --> 01:06:29.280
I go on Xbox live it shows up that way and it makes it so much easier to read

01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:33.800
the notes, because you really can't change things when you play on Xbox Live, so.

01:06:33.800 --> 01:06:35.760
What other songs came out in that song pack?

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:38.640
Oh, Gia, I like that one.

01:06:38.640 --> 01:06:41.080
What is that?

01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:43.080
This is Guitar Breaks, I think?

01:06:43.080 --> 01:06:46.160
Yeah, this is originally from Guitar Breaks.

01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:54.840
Okay, and then we've got Regret, which is, what was that?

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:58.520
I think, okay, well, Regret I think was Beatmania, wasn't it?

01:06:58.520 --> 01:07:02.360
And then we have Jelly Kiss from 2DX 7th, I believe.

01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:06.640
And then we've got Disabled, The Flaw, which is Beatmania.

01:07:06.640 --> 01:07:08.680
Beatmania and I think Poppy Music.

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:13.840
And then Forever Sunshine, which is Max 2, and everyone remembers that song for being

01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:15.880
so awful.

01:07:15.880 --> 01:07:18.680
Huh?

01:07:18.680 --> 01:07:19.800
I think pretty good.

01:07:19.800 --> 01:07:21.240
For five bucks and me, you can't beat it.

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.240
I mean, come on.

01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.440
Just download it, wait for the next pack.

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:27.160
It's better than some of the other song packs they put out not that long ago.

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:28.160
Exactly.

01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:34.160
Just as long as we don't get a whole song pack of mixes of Let Them Move, then it's not too bad.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:39.160
Okay, so, I don't know. Are we gonna do one more, or...?

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.160
Sure, why not.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.160
Alright, one more. Do Oh Yeah! I like that one.

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:43.160
Okay.

01:07:43.160 --> 01:07:48.160
Alright. Let's bring up the Ultra Mix 2 music again.

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:53.160
I like this song, I'm sorry. Done by Assmat and Emi.

01:07:53.160 --> 01:07:55.160
Ready? Here we go!

01:07:55.160 --> 01:08:02.160
From what I remember about this song, it's just one constant stream of notes, really.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:19.160
It looks like they actually put in new background videos in some of this, which I think is kinda cool.

01:08:19.160 --> 01:08:25.160
Or at least background videos we haven't really seen before.

01:08:25.160 --> 01:08:45.720
I like this song because it's different for DDR like you're like what the heck is this

01:08:45.720 --> 01:08:47.720
It's like Bollywood or something.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:52.720
Maybe it's because of some type of in-cab music.

01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.720
Just dance to the beat!

01:08:57.720 --> 01:08:58.720
Don't die!

01:08:58.720 --> 01:09:00.720
I love those run- I love those cheap runs.

01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.720
Oh, dude! Loki's like hecka sweating, look at that.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.720
This is called out of the-

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:14.720
Dance, monkey, dance!

01:09:14.720 --> 01:09:20.720
When we bring the webcam back up, I want to zoom in on Loki's sweat to show what a workout he's getting there.

01:09:20.720 --> 01:09:23.720
Oh man, my legs feel like weights.

01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:26.720
I could play something, but I don't want to play any of those songs.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.720
This one's still being very fun to me.

01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:31.720
You want to do something from Song Pack 8?

01:09:31.720 --> 01:09:34.720
No.

01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:37.720
Alright, Jamie, come on, show us how to do it.

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:49.720
The chat room is suggesting you do a freestyle to this one.

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:51.720
Freestyle, freestyle, freestyle.

01:09:51.720 --> 01:09:54.720
Chat room, love y'all but y'all suck.

01:09:54.720 --> 01:10:02.720
By the way, she got a D. Another D.

01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:05.720
Jamie's here to pretty up the photo op.

01:10:10.720 --> 01:10:13.720
Not really much, though, because Loki's a damn sexy man.

01:10:13.720 --> 01:10:15.720
I know.

01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:18.720
I need to play some more.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:20.720
Do one of the regular Ultramix 2 songs.

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:23.720
I can see you dancing your dance.

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:30.720
I'm fine.

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.860
Now that's that's the picture to get the agony of defeat

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:56.320
It's because you're an American or like I'm in heaven or close your eyes or skulk or something

01:10:56.320 --> 01:11:02.320
Ooh, there's a song called Gyruss. That's totally sweet.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:06.320
It's a remix of the Gyruss theme from Dude. It's awesome.

01:11:12.320 --> 01:11:16.320
Jimmy's apologizing it's taking her so long to pick a song, but she's just kind of picky.

01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.320
Four weeks later.

01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:24.320
By the way, we hardly ever actually play DDR on the show, so this is a rare opportunity for you guys.

01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:31.320
still in time? As if you can't tell by the wheezing. I play a lot of DDR. Oh yeah, oh

01:11:31.940 --> 01:11:38.940
yeah, come on. Come on, come on. Ooh. Um, hold down B. No, I lied, hit A. And this time hold

01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:15.940
her thoughts on Chasmic Cowgirl. She says she hasn't played DDR in a month.

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:31.540
She is making it look good with so many crepes, I'm perfect.

01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:38.540
I used to love this song when it was in Guitar Freaks.

01:12:39.540 --> 01:12:45.540
Yeah, I was just thinking, man, this makes me want to play Guitar Freaks. Do you guys have Guitar Freaks?

01:12:46.540 --> 01:12:47.540
No, sadly not here.

01:12:48.540 --> 01:12:50.540
Damn, I should have brought mine.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:54.540
You gotta shake in our butts now, Mr. DJ.

01:12:54.540 --> 01:12:57.540
You do gotta shake on our butts now, Mr. DJ.

01:13:04.540 --> 01:13:06.540
Okay, well she just has to go and show me up now.

01:13:07.540 --> 01:13:08.540
That's no fair.

01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.540
That's because she's more in shape than I am.

01:13:14.540 --> 01:13:17.540
Yeah, she's been preparing for that mud run, so you know she's got the stamina for this.

01:13:17.540 --> 01:13:24.540
I've been preparing for a Big Mac

01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:28.940
Two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions and get this

01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:32.040
sesame seed bun baby

01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:39.040
too much burger for one man to handle

01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:49.040
Yay! All right, what did you think?

01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:56.040
Okay, so that, you know, they have an eight for the...

01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.040
Show us your moves!

01:13:57.040 --> 01:14:00.040
And a five for...

01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:06.040
The verdict is a B. She got a slightly better score than Loki. Thank you.

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.040
because he said something that made me laugh.

01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.040
It was a new high score.

01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:13.040
I broke someone's score.

01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:15.040
Alright, so what did you think of that?

01:14:15.040 --> 01:14:17.040
Get your chair back.

01:14:17.040 --> 01:14:19.040
Fun?

01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.040
Yeah, pretty fun.

01:14:20.040 --> 01:14:21.040
Alright.

01:14:21.040 --> 01:14:23.040
I need to start doing DDR again.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:25.040
Alright.

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:29.040
Because the ironic thing is, even though we talk about these music games a whole lot here on the station,

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.040
we haven't played them in quite a while.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.040
No.

01:14:33.040 --> 01:14:35.960
So hey, I played step mania, but yeah, that's with my hand

01:14:35.960 --> 01:14:41.160
I played the control I played the button button revolution and I now know why people don't exercise in jeans

01:14:41.240 --> 01:14:44.320
All right. Anyway, can we go? Can we go back to radio? All right

01:14:45.160 --> 01:14:48.280
What we're gonna do now is we're gonna go ahead and open up the skype line

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:51.720
For those of you guys that have any feedback you want to talk about 2dx

01:14:51.880 --> 01:14:54.760
Night style you want to talk about what else is going on in the scene?

01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:58.400
We were talking a little bit about a bawani tournaments going on earlier

01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:05.400
And if you have any feedback on UltraMix 2 and the performance of Dark Sakura and Loki, we certainly would love to hear that as well.

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:10.400
So, we are going to go ahead and open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call.

01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:16.400
Again, to do that, head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on Interact With Us.

01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:19.400
Alright, let's go ahead, we got one coming in.

01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:20.400
If you dare.

01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:21.400
Alright.

01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400
Hey, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:26.400
Ledger Zaku here.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.400
Hello Zaku, how you doing?

01:15:27.400 --> 01:15:38.400
As always, I'm just coming back from Spring Break and managing to play 2DX 10th style, unfortunately.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:41.400
Wait, you did get to play 2DX 10th style?

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.400
It was kind of like, yeah.

01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:50.400
Yes, because, you know, Long Island, not far from the city, has a place that has 2DX 10th.

01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:56.400
And I managed to travel out there by bus a couple of weeks ago on a Saturday.

01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400
Getting on the bus to go nerd it up, huh?

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.400
fun.

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:28.400
Anyway.

01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:34.100
Yeah, I was whoring that up too, but I mean, tense style, I mean, okay, I think I see the

01:16:34.100 --> 01:16:38.300
changes for the fact that the timing is just, you know, especially for new people that are

01:16:38.300 --> 01:16:39.920
trying to, like, struggle.

01:16:39.920 --> 01:16:41.440
Did you play in towel mode?

01:16:41.440 --> 01:16:46.520
No, I mean, I saw other folks playing in towel, but that's about it.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:50.120
I mean, I saw other folks breaking out the towel and putting it on there, but...

01:16:50.120 --> 01:16:53.900
I can't play without the towel.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:59.500
But anyways, you know, I'm hearing word that 2DX12 Happy Sky is going up for location tests.

01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:00.500
Oh, yes.

01:17:00.500 --> 01:17:01.500
That name is so...

01:17:01.500 --> 01:17:06.100
You repeat us to it, we were going to talk about that a little bit later, but yes, they've

01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:10.340
announced 2DX12 style, also known as Happy Sky.

01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.100
Which is ironic when you consider what my online name is, Sky.

01:17:13.100 --> 01:17:14.100
Happy Sky!

01:17:14.100 --> 01:17:15.100
That made you Happy Sky.

01:17:15.100 --> 01:17:16.100
I'm so happy!

01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:17.100
I'm happy that this game's coming.

01:17:17.100 --> 01:17:21.980
At this point, I mean, we managed to get the upgrade in that place that managed to get

01:17:21.980 --> 01:17:22.980
test style.

01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:27.680
See, it was originally 9th, but late last year they managed to go up to 10th, seeing

01:17:27.680 --> 01:17:32.380
that they got the 2DX machine earlier last year.

01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:40.280
So I'm assuming that, according to the thread, once I mentioned 12th, that they'll try to

01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:46.300
plan to just go after getting that upgrade kit, the same way they did for 10th.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:48.900
That surprises when we managed to get 10th, you know?

01:17:48.900 --> 01:17:53.300
Okay. Well, you know what, Zaku, I have a question for you on a totally unrelated subject.

01:17:53.300 --> 01:17:57.180
I know you probably called in to talk about that, but I know you call us quite a bit when

01:17:57.180 --> 01:18:00.100
you want to talk about what's going on on the East Coast and what's going on in the

01:18:00.100 --> 01:18:03.020
tournament scene. Did you hear what we were talking about with the West Coast March Madness

01:18:03.020 --> 01:18:07.140
tournament that just happened? What's up with that? Why are the tournaments declining? Is

01:18:07.140 --> 01:18:10.620
it just us and California, or is it happening to you guys in New York as well?

01:18:10.620 --> 01:18:14.220
It really depends, because in our area, I mean, we're having tournaments. We're about

01:18:14.220 --> 01:18:19.940
to have a big tournament, hopefully in April, next month in Albany. We already had a slew

01:18:19.940 --> 01:18:25.060
of smaller low level tournaments, one of which almost ended up in fighting as I told you

01:18:25.060 --> 01:18:28.820
last time. Yeah, yeah, I remember that. With the drama? Well there's one reason why you

01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:32.800
don't have the... No, but I mean that was because of the locals who basically acted

01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:38.740
like assholes, and basically started disrespecting other outsiders, outside players who were

01:18:38.740 --> 01:18:43.540
beating them to it. So what do you think is causing the decline here then? It's not really

01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:46.220
that much of a decline, it really depends on where you go.

01:18:46.220 --> 01:18:48.180
I mean it depends on where scene thrives.

01:18:48.180 --> 01:18:50.100
I can understand where Northern California...

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:51.800
You know, I can understand your guns....

01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:55.060
your scene over there because it's striving for something new,

01:18:55.060 --> 01:18:56.260
like In the Groove.

01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:58.580
I think you know, I think you're on the verge,

01:18:58.580 --> 01:19:01.500
I think in my honest opinion you're on the verge of just switching

01:19:01.500 --> 01:19:03.440
on to more In the Groove tournaments.

01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:04.780
That's why I'm seeing California going.

01:19:04.780 --> 01:19:07.140
I don't know how I feel about that though to be honest.

01:19:07.140 --> 01:19:08.720
I don't know how I feel about In the Groove.

01:19:08.720 --> 01:19:11.720
Umm...

01:19:11.720 --> 01:19:16.240
the freestyle part of it. Yeah, that's the problem. In the group, the group was made

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:21.400
for Perfect Attack Tournament. The East Coast already held in the group tournaments and

01:19:21.400 --> 01:19:28.080
made it on the break late last year. And it was a pretty good turnout. I don't know. It

01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:32.880
doesn't seem like the game's really that... You're always hearing about the thing... It

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:39.880
may be. I know it was built for basically DDR on crack because of the fact that it's

01:19:39.880 --> 01:19:41.800
going to be on 10 foot and 10 feet.

01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:44.840
Wait, I mean, you're talking like 10 footers, 12 of 13.

01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.160
In the groove.

01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:47.660
Well said.

01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:49.960
In the groove is basically, in the groove in a nutshell

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.400
is DDR on crack.

01:19:51.400 --> 01:19:52.120
That's what it is.

01:19:52.120 --> 01:19:57.000
In the groove in a nutshell is DDR on crap.

01:19:57.000 --> 01:19:59.400
But wait till in the groove two comes out, and then you know

01:19:59.400 --> 01:20:01.640
they're going to start thinking.

01:20:01.640 --> 01:20:04.780
Because, you know what, I've been warming up to in the groove.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.320
I honestly cannot knock the game.

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:08.740
No, you've become de-wamp-ed guys.

01:20:08.740 --> 01:20:12.380
Pretty good. I mean, you know, the tournament scene is still there

01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:16.100
It's just you know, it needs something good and he's something new to go on

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:26.580
We were so grateful of managing to pull off a Nationals tournament last year and that created it that got a big turnout

01:20:26.580 --> 01:20:29.460
Not only that we managed to expose DDR to a lot of things

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:34.260
So a lot of people that probably never heard of it and we're getting DDR the limelight it deserves

01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.820
I mean, you know tournaments in fact are doing you know more

01:20:37.820 --> 01:20:44.620
are doing, you know, more great things for, you know, it depends on where it is, though.

01:20:44.620 --> 01:20:49.860
In case in point, this, the city, where, you know, a big, major tournament would basically

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:56.420
expose more people to DDR, thus we'd be getting, you know, places such as Fuse and MTV2, you

01:20:56.420 --> 01:20:58.860
know, basically filming us during the tournaments, and...

01:20:58.860 --> 01:21:01.860
Well, yeah, but we have yet to see what happens with that.

01:21:01.860 --> 01:21:07.320
Well, they're prepared, well, from what I heard, they are preparing for this year's.

01:21:07.320 --> 01:21:10.320
They might do another Nationals tournament this year in October.

01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:12.320
It's all talk until something happens.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:18.320
This whole exposure thing, though, I don't think it's necessarily that good of a thing.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:22.320
Yeah, but think about it. It's in New York City and you have mods such as frequency busting

01:21:22.320 --> 01:21:25.320
putting foot to ass trying to help, you know, help it get out there.

01:21:25.320 --> 01:21:30.320
You know, it's usually when something gets to be a little too popular that it starts getting...

01:21:30.320 --> 01:21:34.320
It's not trying to be too popular. It's just trying to get it, you know, get it to people

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:37.320
That way, a few more people know about it.

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:41.320
That's all. That's pretty much it in a nutshell.

01:21:41.320 --> 01:21:45.320
The tournament scene thrives depending on where you're at.

01:21:45.320 --> 01:21:48.320
And it's basically what you make of it.

01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:53.320
Whether or not you want to decide to pedal in the groove and in the group 2, which is coming out.

01:21:53.320 --> 01:21:59.320
Which could be an alternative to people we've been sucking on. Extreme for what now? Almost two and a half years?

01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:02.320
Well, we will see. That's really all we can say right now.

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:06.880
as we will see but I gotta we gotta go cuz the Skype lines ringing but is there

01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:12.440
any other final thought you have for us aku basically just you know that just

01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:17.600
basically you know in the groove to might you know just be just be ready in

01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:21.880
case just just try not I don't know I will give in the groove to a fair shot

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:27.640
just like I gave in yeah I will you promise you promise open mind in the

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:29.640
It'll at least be a jar.

01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:31.640
Okay, I've still got, I've got to try it, you know.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:32.140
Alright.

01:22:32.140 --> 01:22:33.640
Alright, Zaku, have a good one, buddy.

01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:34.140
Alright, take care.

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:34.640
Take care.

01:22:34.640 --> 01:22:35.140
Later.

01:22:35.140 --> 01:22:36.640
Alright, let's take another call.

01:22:36.640 --> 01:22:37.640
Let's go to this one.

01:22:38.640 --> 01:22:39.640
If I can get this here.

01:22:39.640 --> 01:22:41.640
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:43.640
Merging from the shadows of Bamani style.

01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:47.640
Here's your resident 2DX bastard, DarklineXVI.

01:22:47.640 --> 01:22:49.640
Hello, our resident 2DX bastard.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.640
What's on your mind?

01:22:51.640 --> 01:22:54.640
Well, I've already, I finally got my copy of 2DX Night Style.

01:22:54.640 --> 01:22:56.640
Hurrah, what do you think?

01:22:56.640 --> 01:22:58.040
Yeah, it's really good.

01:22:58.040 --> 01:22:59.640
Did you get the one with all the stickers?

01:23:00.140 --> 01:23:02.740
Well, I don't have a sticker. I only have the regular edition.

01:23:03.540 --> 01:23:05.540
I want all the DVDs and the stickers.

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:07.540
So what are your thoughts? Tell us what you think.

01:23:08.140 --> 01:23:11.540
It's really good, actually. It's almost like in the arcade version.

01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:12.540
Uh-oh.

01:23:13.040 --> 01:23:14.040
Wait, what about the timing?

01:23:14.040 --> 01:23:15.240
We have to talk about the timing.

01:23:15.440 --> 01:23:16.940
Specifically, not the timing.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.640
They think the timing's okay?

01:23:18.940 --> 01:23:20.440
The timing is okay, actually.

01:23:20.540 --> 01:23:21.140
I need mine.

01:23:21.640 --> 01:23:22.840
Well, it's gonna be probably-

01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:24.540
What was the deciding factor of the timing?

01:23:24.540 --> 01:23:25.040
Guys.

01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:32.040
I was going to say, because with the arcade there, of course you're upgrading the hardware and stuff, so you've got the timing issues for that.

01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:37.040
But with the home versions, it's pretty much just, you know, to rescan it, throw new songs in, you're done.

01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:39.040
So that's pretty much all for that.

01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:45.040
So of course, timing should be right on, compared with some of the other ones, it should be just fine.

01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:49.040
So anyways, you enjoy it?

01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.040
Yeah, of course I do enjoy it.

01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:53.040
Hey Sky, remember the videos that I sent you?

01:23:53.040 --> 01:23:58.500
Yes, I was gonna ask you kids you sent me actually one of your you know videos where you actually hooked it up

01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:04.780
So you're playing 2dx and you can see you actually like you were playing love shine and you see the notes falling

01:24:04.780 --> 01:24:06.780
I didn't play love love shine

01:24:07.560 --> 01:24:12.080
Right. It's a new top vision video and use but you set it up in your house so that you we can see your

01:24:12.880 --> 01:24:17.280
Fingers playing the song instead of the typical video. How'd you set that up? That's pretty cool

01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:19.180
Yeah, you know I use that, you know

01:24:19.180 --> 01:24:23.180
I use a tripod, I use a camcorder, and then I use my PC as my monitor.

01:24:25.180 --> 01:24:31.180
Speaking of which, I'm gonna send you a link of what my setting looks like.

01:24:31.180 --> 01:24:35.180
Alright, put that on our chatroom, www.orangelaunchradio.com, clicking on chat.

01:24:35.180 --> 01:24:39.180
Go ahead and slap that up in our chatroom so our folks there can check it out, the link.

01:24:39.180 --> 01:24:42.180
Yeah, this is what my setup looks like.

01:24:42.180 --> 01:24:47.180
Okay, now do you have a site where we can actually download the Tatsujin videos for those that want to see what this looks like?

01:24:47.180 --> 01:24:50.780
Are you going to throw them on Bomani style like everyone else that does Tatsujin videos?

01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:52.940
Well, mine is different, so...

01:24:52.940 --> 01:24:55.380
I got it from DustBacon.

01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:58.500
Are you really made out of iron?

01:24:58.500 --> 01:25:00.540
Haha, that's true.

01:25:00.540 --> 01:25:03.620
There's a difference between Tatsujin and Tetsujin.

01:25:03.620 --> 01:25:06.820
Oh, sorry.

01:25:06.820 --> 01:25:13.700
I got told. Here's the link for my Tatsujin videos, as well as the Seastar player and others.

01:25:13.700 --> 01:25:15.280
Alright, right on.

01:25:15.280 --> 01:25:21.920
And let me log into my photo bucket so I can give you the link to what my setup looks like.

01:25:21.920 --> 01:25:25.640
While you're doing that, what would you say would be your favorite of the new consumer

01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:27.280
songs that are in 9th Style?

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:32.320
Well my favorite, here's a correction, it's not photogenic, it's photogenic.

01:25:32.320 --> 01:25:33.940
Oh my bad.

01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.400
I read it quickly.

01:25:36.400 --> 01:25:37.400
It's photogenic.

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:38.400
Okay, photogenic.

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:39.400
Yeah, my favorite.

01:25:39.400 --> 01:25:40.400
Is that your favorite?

01:25:40.400 --> 01:25:41.400
Yeah, photogenic's my favorite.

01:25:41.400 --> 01:25:49.400
Yeah, photogenic's my favorite. Other than that, it's also like a Jäger final attack, or a Sakuretsu Jäger dance.

01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:55.400
Is it just me, or has the Denjin Jäger gone to that?

01:26:00.400 --> 01:26:02.400
I do have a video. I do have a video.

01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:04.400
You're going to have to send that to me at some point so I can check it out.

01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:07.400
I'll send it to you after this call.

01:26:07.400 --> 01:26:09.400
Okay, sounds good.

01:26:09.400 --> 01:26:12.400
Is there anything else you wanted to say, Siggy?

01:26:12.400 --> 01:26:14.400
Because I've got to let you go to get somebody else here on the line.

01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:16.400
Is there anything else you want to say?

01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:20.400
Nothing much else, but I'm just happy that I have my night style.

01:26:20.400 --> 01:26:21.400
Alright, sounds good.

01:26:21.400 --> 01:26:24.400
Keep us posted on any developments going on in the 2DX world.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:27.400
Yeah, I've already sent you the link to what my settings look like.

01:26:27.400 --> 01:26:29.400
Alright, sounds good.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:31.400
We'll check that out in the chat room.

01:26:31.400 --> 01:26:32.640
All right, have a good one, bud.

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:34.160
Later. Later.

01:26:34.160 --> 01:26:40.120
All right, let's try to pick up a call here, if I can.

01:26:40.120 --> 01:26:42.480
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.800
Hey, it's Jimmy.

01:26:43.800 --> 01:26:45.300
Hey, what's up?

01:26:45.300 --> 01:26:46.560
Not much.

01:26:46.560 --> 01:26:49.960
How's it going? I got to turn down my window real quick. There we go. That's all right, yes.

01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.520
First rule of calling into radio, turn off your radio.

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:54.560
Yeah, I know how that is. All right.

01:26:54.560 --> 01:26:56.600
What's up? What's on your mind?

01:26:56.600 --> 01:26:57.900
I'm just

01:26:57.900 --> 01:26:59.220
going off of

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:00.940
the first caller,

01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940
uh... i t g that right

01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:05.780
way uh... tournaments are going here in socal it's

01:27:05.780 --> 01:27:08.860
basically all in the group there

01:27:08.860 --> 01:27:11.620
what though you're saying in southern california now it's all about in the

01:27:11.620 --> 01:27:12.220
group

01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.020
yeah i don't want to read it on you

01:27:15.020 --> 01:27:17.680
the first big one was in stonewood engines

01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.260
everyone was pretty good

01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:20.180
image

01:27:20.180 --> 01:27:23.140
that's cuz you can see the percentages on the screen in it

01:27:23.140 --> 01:27:26.500
you get instant feedback while the people are playing right

01:27:26.500 --> 01:27:29.660
so you can have an account the great small people are going

01:27:29.660 --> 01:27:40.660
Okay, so you can kind of continue to watch the scores go up, because In the Groove is one of those games where it's considered acceptable to use the scores as something that determines how well you do in the tournament.

01:27:40.660 --> 01:27:48.660
Yeah, because basically everyone knows exactly how the scoring system works, and it's just a good scoring system, I think, for a competition.

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:56.660
Okay, well what I have to know, I have no doubt that In the Groove is a great game for tournaments, but I have to know, freestyle. How does freestyle work?

01:27:56.660 --> 01:28:00.660
I've yet to see a freestyle tournament for it. There's only been...

01:28:00.660 --> 01:28:01.660
Yeah, there's a reason for that.

01:28:01.660 --> 01:28:02.660
Told ya. Told ya.

01:28:02.660 --> 01:28:05.660
Yeah, all songs just aren't there.

01:28:06.660 --> 01:28:07.660
Yeah, I know.

01:28:07.660 --> 01:28:13.660
I've freestyled, and I really don't think there's a whole lot of freestylable songs on ITG.

01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:15.660
Are you hoping that they fix that with ITG 2?

01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:20.660
I really do. With the DDR crossovers, I guess we'll call them.

01:28:20.660 --> 01:28:21.660
Like all the...

01:28:21.660 --> 01:28:22.660
We'll follow the sun and...

01:28:22.660 --> 01:28:23.660
Right, and the Bambi songs.

01:28:23.660 --> 01:28:24.660
All that stuff.

01:28:24.660 --> 01:28:29.860
Okay, all right. Well, anything else you want to share with us, my friend?

01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:32.660
Um, I'm hoping to get to the X-nights style soon.

01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:36.860
Yeah, we all want it, but you know, we're poor, you know, what can we say?

01:28:36.860 --> 01:28:41.060
But yeah, freestyle in the groove doesn't really work.

01:28:41.060 --> 01:28:45.060
Hopefully they will fix that with In the Groove 2. We shall see.

01:28:45.060 --> 01:28:48.260
That's what I'm hoping for. All right, thanks a lot guys. Sounds good. Have a good one, buddy.

01:28:48.260 --> 01:28:53.260
You too. Later. All right, let's take one more call.

01:28:53.260 --> 01:28:58.960
hi you're on orange songs radio it's the one the one it wait wait wait crap there

01:28:58.960 --> 01:29:03.820
we go it's the one and only token black cosplayer Ron how you guys doing hello

01:29:03.820 --> 01:29:09.820
our token black cosplayer friend how are you competition at here in the form of

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:17.560
jre oga there you know you know jre oga H yeah a long time yes one of my friends

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:22.560
Wow. Who knew? There's more than one. There's more than one.

01:29:22.560 --> 01:29:24.560
What's up with that? How are you doing my friend?

01:29:24.560 --> 01:29:29.560
I'm doing good. We had a cosplay photo shoot in Central Park today.

01:29:29.560 --> 01:29:33.560
We got kicked out.

01:29:33.560 --> 01:29:40.560
Now this I have to hear about. So for those who don't know, because remember we have new listeners on tonight, what is cosplay for those who don't know?

01:29:40.560 --> 01:29:47.560
cosplay or costume play, you can also make your favorite anime, video game, or manga characters at anime conventions.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:55.560
And sometimes this can be scantily clad females from fighting games, or this can be just, like, downright ugly guys from who knows what, but...

01:29:55.560 --> 01:29:57.560
Or, or, you know, whatever.

01:29:57.560 --> 01:30:01.560
Downright ugly guys cosplaying as scantily clad females between main players.

01:30:01.560 --> 01:30:02.560
Yes, I've seen that too.

01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:03.560
Manfay.

01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:11.560
So, okay, I have to know. How did you guys, what were you guys setting up to do in Central Park and how did you get kicked out? That's what I have to know.

01:30:11.560 --> 01:30:17.560
That's just it. We didn't do anything. We were just taking pictures of ourselves in costumes and stuff.

01:30:17.560 --> 01:30:20.560
You were dressed up like freaks. You were freaks and the freaks have to go.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.560
It was mostly hot EGL girls.

01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:30.560
Now, were you guys all dressing up like ghosts in a big group and having a rally and, you know, then they might have kicked you out because of that?

01:30:30.560 --> 01:30:34.560
No, it was more like, you know, less than that.

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:42.560
Of course, you know, whenever cosplay events in the park happen, like say in Tokyo, then a bajillion people take pictures of it and it ends up in Brutes Magazine, right?

01:30:42.560 --> 01:30:47.560
Right, but it was only like five people from outside that was walking around took pictures of us.

01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:53.560
What I'm curious about, was it the scantily clad females that got you kicked out of Central Park?

01:30:53.560 --> 01:30:58.560
Nope, it seems that you need a permit to take pictures in Central Park.

01:30:58.560 --> 01:31:04.560
What? What? Everybody and their mother was going to Central Park to take pictures of the gates. Did they get a permit for that?

01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:14.560
That's just it. That's what we argued. They said because it's for commercial purposes, we need a permit. And on the weekends, we need special permission from the mayor.

01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:17.560
Oh my gosh. I say-

01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:19.560
This is for commercial purposes?

01:31:19.560 --> 01:31:21.560
No, this is for amateurs and for our websites.

01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:25.560
Oh my gosh. I say next time you're there, burn down the gates.

01:31:25.560 --> 01:31:27.560
Gates are already gone.

01:31:27.560 --> 01:31:31.560
Damn, see? Mission accomplished!

01:31:31.560 --> 01:31:35.560
They've been replaced by Ultra Kade machines.

01:31:35.560 --> 01:31:39.560
You know, that's just so ridiculous. I mean, I used to do LARP

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:43.560
vampire games in Alabama, and we were just a ball kinds of insane.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.560
Alabama parking lot or whatever you did is slightly different

01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:51.560
than Central Park. No, we would do it in downtown Mobile at Bienville Square.

01:31:51.560 --> 01:31:55.560
Okay, okay. Which is... My bad. Which is a historical

01:31:55.560 --> 01:31:57.560
They should have told them it was for a school project.

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.560
But it's a historical landmark.

01:31:59.560 --> 01:32:00.560
We did.

01:32:00.560 --> 01:32:01.560
And we never got anything for it.

01:32:01.560 --> 01:32:05.560
Yeah, that's the easy excuse whenever you need to get out of something.

01:32:05.560 --> 01:32:08.560
Uh, it's for a school project. We didn't know we were doing it.

01:32:08.560 --> 01:32:10.560
Not this time.

01:32:10.560 --> 01:32:16.560
Alright, anything going on in your gaming world you want to share with us, buddy?

01:32:16.560 --> 01:32:21.560
I was at the PSP release at my job. We sold 260 of them.

01:32:21.560 --> 01:32:22.560
Oh my gosh.

01:32:22.560 --> 01:32:26.560
15 came back, and 15 came back the next day.

01:32:26.560 --> 01:32:30.560
Is that the dead pixel thing that's going on with the new PSPs?

01:32:30.560 --> 01:32:31.560
Mm-hmm.

01:32:31.560 --> 01:32:34.560
So, are they really that bad? Have you seen them?

01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:38.560
No. Some are, some are.

01:32:38.560 --> 01:32:41.560
It says we're geeks, well, we have to take a look at these things.

01:32:41.560 --> 01:32:44.560
We got Dan, who's actually a manager of a game, stopping town.

01:32:44.560 --> 01:32:46.560
It's very, very minor, and these people are too anal.

01:32:46.560 --> 01:32:49.560
Hey, I got, you know what, can you send me some of those defective PSPs?

01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:51.560
Because I'll take them off your hands.

01:32:51.560 --> 01:32:52.560
I tried.

01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:53.560
I'm defective.

01:32:53.560 --> 01:32:54.560
Yeah, quote, unquote, defective.

01:32:54.560 --> 01:32:58.520
Okay, Dan, I know you're dying to say something.

01:32:58.520 --> 01:33:03.520
The people who are bitching about one or two dead pixels on their PSPs are anal-retentive

01:33:03.520 --> 01:33:07.280
bastards who should be shot on sight.

01:33:07.280 --> 01:33:08.880
No shit.

01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:09.880
Thank you.

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:10.880
You're welcome.

01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.920
The official line now is, we don't take them back, they gotta go to Sony if they have dead

01:33:15.920 --> 01:33:16.920
pixels.

01:33:16.920 --> 01:33:17.920
And Sony doesn't care.

01:33:17.920 --> 01:33:18.920
Oh, snap.

01:33:18.920 --> 01:33:19.920
No, Sony does care.

01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.920
Sony is replacing them.

01:33:20.920 --> 01:33:26.920
Which is very, very decent of Sony. Basically, what you're going to get back is another dead

01:33:26.920 --> 01:33:33.280
pixel PSP that they fixed. So, you know, but as for anyone who has problems with dead pixels

01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:39.360
on their PSP, stick with it. They'll either go away or you'll adjust. You know, out of

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:42.640
the gajillions of pixels, if one or two are dead, hey, consider yourself lucky. Some people

01:33:42.640 --> 01:33:49.640
have a couple dozen. They should be mad. Yeah. 30 people. Well, you know, considering how

01:33:49.640 --> 01:33:56.140
Considering how much they charge for those things, though, you think the thing would run absolutely perfectly. That's the only issue.

01:33:56.140 --> 01:33:58.140
You ever bought a tire for your car?

01:33:58.140 --> 01:33:58.640
Yeah.

01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:00.640
Did it go flat?

01:34:00.640 --> 01:34:02.140
Yeah, but they replaced it for free.

01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:05.640
LCD screens have dead pixels. Sony will replace it for free.

01:34:05.640 --> 01:34:06.640
Oh, alright.

01:34:06.640 --> 01:34:08.640
I mean, that's it. You know, it just happens.

01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:09.640
Alright.

01:34:09.640 --> 01:34:13.640
So you have it lucky. We have to take them back. We have to.

01:34:13.640 --> 01:34:15.140
Where do you work?

01:34:15.140 --> 01:34:16.640
Best Buy.

01:34:16.640 --> 01:34:18.640
Hahahaha. Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34:18.640 --> 01:34:21.520
Not because you sell that extra insurance or whatever?

01:34:21.520 --> 01:34:24.360
Even without the extra insurance, they bring it back.

01:34:24.360 --> 01:34:28.320
We have to take it back, we stamp it out, devote, we send it back to the manufacturer.

01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:32.400
But the thing is, Sony doesn't reimburse the manufacturer for that return.

01:34:32.400 --> 01:34:35.440
You need to take out your frustration on the multi-key machine.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:39.960
We kind of, we get most of it back, like 85% of the value we get back, more or less.

01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:46.280
They won't do it with the dead pixels because they don't consider those to be a defect.

01:34:46.280 --> 01:34:47.600
Best Buy policy will change.

01:34:47.600 --> 01:34:49.560
Right now, I think they're doing the right thing.

01:34:49.560 --> 01:34:54.200
I think, hey, if we had 100 extra systems in stock, and I had 10 people want to bring

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:56.940
them back and exchange them, hey, no problem.

01:34:56.940 --> 01:35:03.560
But according to Sony, Sony, Sony, Sony, their whole take on it is, this is how PSPs are.

01:35:03.560 --> 01:35:04.840
There's a problem with the pixels.

01:35:04.840 --> 01:35:05.840
You send them to us.

01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:07.000
We'll take care of it.

01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:08.240
Don't bother the retailer.

01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:11.600
And most of the smaller retailers have said, hey, we can't take them back for that reason.

01:35:11.600 --> 01:35:14.800
Isn't this supposed to be virtually invisible anyway when you're playing?

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:19.640
In game, you don't see it unless it's a solid color screen.

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.440
From what I was told, when you turn it off, you see the dead pixels.

01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:26.440
Well, yeah, and that's the thing is these people, they're not trying it for a couple

01:35:26.440 --> 01:35:29.000
hours and saying, wow, this doesn't interrupt my gameplay.

01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.960
They turn it on on the boot up screen, see a pixel that's green when it should be white

01:35:32.960 --> 01:35:33.960
and lose their minds.

01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:36.640
Well, it makes sense after they just spent $250 on it.

01:35:36.640 --> 01:35:41.000
If they'd run the Spider-Man DVD through it, 90% of the time, the pixels unfreeze since

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:44.040
they're just frozen, not dead, and the problem fixes itself.

01:35:44.040 --> 01:35:48.920
oh that's weird and the thing is two months down the road you might have a

01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:52.920
whole different set of dead pixels because it's not like you're gonna get

01:35:52.920 --> 01:35:56.600
one that's gonna work forever LCD screens do that and I'm gonna have to

01:35:56.600 --> 01:35:59.040
do monitor can tell you that I've heard the dead pixel thing going on with the

01:35:59.040 --> 01:36:04.120
DS as well so it's not just you know PSP it's nature technology anyway we gotta

01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:07.120
let you go with it we gotta let you go but but have a good one thanks for

01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:11.080
calling us you got all right later I've got to take one more because this guy's

01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.520

still trying to get in, thanks, but we are gonna just come back to this later. We'll do the match

01:36:57.160 --> 01:37:00.840
game, don't forget, we got that coming up a little later on, but for now we're gonna get into the

01:37:00.840 --> 01:37:07.860
Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match. So, for those of you guys unfamiliar with the Cage Match, the way

01:37:07.860 --> 01:37:12.540

Lounge Radio's Bumani Music Amore program.

01:37:28.320 --> 01:37:30.820
And the winner gets a break from having to pick a song.

01:37:30.820 --> 01:37:36.300
That's right so Jamie it's your break because you won last week and it's Yoko Kano and

01:37:36.300 --> 01:37:41.220
the song is rise now remember there's no rhyme or reason for why we picked these

01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:46.060
songs it's three songs we like you pick your favorite and it goes in rotation

01:37:46.060 --> 01:37:50.100
all right so here it is you only get a clip of this song though because it

01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:57.100
win last week. Here's a clip. Song number one, Yoko Kanno. Rise. Enjoy.

01:38:20.100 --> 01:38:38.100
I'm a soldier born to stand in this waking hell I am

01:38:38.100 --> 01:38:44.100
With nothing more than I can come to you

01:38:44.100 --> 01:38:51.100
Pray myself, please don't forget Life's a trade and we are friends

01:38:51.100 --> 01:38:56.100
Please give me that chance to be a fool

01:38:56.100 --> 01:39:03.100
People face in the fire together

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:11.100
If we don't win the moon, I'll be a clown

01:39:11.100 --> 01:39:18.100
Save your tears, come for the day When the pain is far behind

01:39:18.100 --> 01:39:25.100
On your feet, come with me There are some of you still alive

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:31.100
Save your fears, take your place Save them for the judgment day

01:39:31.100 --> 01:40:01.060
All right, that was the clip I made.

01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:07.060
And on behalf of song number one, Yoko Kano with Rise, and now you get to hear two new songs in their entirety.

01:40:07.060 --> 01:40:10.060
I'm gonna start it off with my pick for tonight's cage match.

01:40:10.060 --> 01:40:16.060
Now, you might remember, or you may not if this is your first time listening to Orange Commons Radio, so welcome,

01:40:16.060 --> 01:40:21.060
but we've retired a couple songs from the cage match. When a song wins four times, we retire it.

01:40:21.060 --> 01:40:25.060
And the first song that ever got retired was the top 40 hit.

01:40:25.060 --> 01:40:27.060
It was Gwen Stefani, remember that?

01:40:27.060 --> 01:40:32.640
I'm gonna try I'm gonna change hey you watch it I like my Gwen okay okay so I'm

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:37.200
gonna try my top 40 luck again because I love this chick I'm sorry don't roll

01:40:37.200 --> 01:40:45.920
your eyes at me hey that's it they don't see that they do when I get upset all

01:40:45.920 --> 01:40:50.520
right so anyway I'm gonna try my top 40 like well what what what what what what

01:40:50.520 --> 01:40:55.560
So, we're going to do a dance remix, though, of a Top 40 hit.

01:40:55.560 --> 01:40:57.560
So this is...

01:40:57.560 --> 01:40:59.680
One of the stupid Haddaway songs again.

01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:00.680
It's not Haddaway.

01:41:00.680 --> 01:41:02.520
This is actually Kelly Clarkson.

01:41:02.520 --> 01:41:03.520
Oh, God.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.560
I get the zero automatically.

01:41:05.560 --> 01:41:06.860
No, no, no.

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:07.860
You listen to it first.

01:41:07.860 --> 01:41:08.960
Oh, so it's a bathroom break.

01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:12.120
This is Kelly Clarkson, you haters.

01:41:12.120 --> 01:41:17.520
The song is Since You Been Gone, and it's the Jason Nevins Rock the Club mix.

01:41:17.520 --> 01:41:19.520
Enjoy, guys.

01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:34.520
Here's the thing, we started our friends It was cool, but it was our pretend

01:41:34.520 --> 01:41:45.520
Yeah yeah, since you've been gone You're dedicated, you took the time

01:41:45.520 --> 01:41:48.920
Wasn't long till I called you mine

And all you ever hear me say

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:01.920
Is how I picture me with you

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:05.920
That's all you ever hear me say

01:42:05.920 --> 01:42:09.920
But since you've been gone

01:42:09.920 --> 01:42:12.920
I can't breathe for the first time

01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:16.920

How can I put it? You put me on

And soon though you had your chance, I blew it

Out of sight, out of mind

01:43:20.920 --> 01:43:23.920
Shut your mouth, I just can't say again

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:28.920
Again and again and again and again

01:43:40.920 --> 01:43:44.920
Since you've been gone, since you've been gone

01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:47.920
I can't breathe for the first time

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:52.400
I'm stumbling on, yeah yeah

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:55.760
Let's see you, yeah yeah

01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:59.920
I get what I want

01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:02.960
I get what I need for the first time

01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:06.880
I'm stumbling on, yeah yeah

01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:10.080
Let's see you, yeah yeah

01:44:10.080 --> 01:44:17.080
Cause you're not, cause you're not, I get what I want

01:44:17.080 --> 01:44:19.080
And you've been gone

01:44:25.080 --> 01:44:27.080
And you've been gone

01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:46.280
All right, that was song number two in tonight's cage match.

01:44:46.280 --> 01:44:51.200
Kelly Clarkson, Since You Been Gone, the Jason Nevins Rock the Club mix.

01:44:51.200 --> 01:44:57.060
Let's go around and see if that rocked people up or if they're going to rock it on out of

01:44:57.060 --> 01:45:11.140
here let's see dark Sakura it oh no more talking for you Dan the man since you

01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:16.460
have a mic Dan the man since you have a mic would you think it's been gone

01:45:16.460 --> 01:45:23.260
unimpressive on scale of one to ten negative four all right Loki there is no

01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:27.460
amount of alcohol in this world that make that song good that was awful I

01:45:27.460 --> 01:45:32.100
mean you can remix that song to hell and it would still suck so guess what it

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:37.820
gets a one because it's killing Clarkson what were you thinking no bad and you

01:45:37.820 --> 01:45:42.340
flipped Matt Ross this coming from the guy who brings his girlfriend over every

01:45:42.340 --> 01:45:47.700
Tuesday to watch American Idol doesn't mean I'm gonna buy any of their albums

01:45:47.700 --> 01:45:55.700
Okay, I like reality TV sometimes just because I watch reality TV does not mean that I'm gonna buy the music

01:45:56.220 --> 01:46:01.860
Clay Aiken is funny-looking Kelly Clarkson is a hot mama. Clay Aiken is funny-looking

01:46:02.660 --> 01:46:04.460

01:50:44.580 --> 01:50:49.580
or

01:50:49.580 --> 01:50:54.580
or

01:50:54.580 --> 01:50:59.580
or

01:50:59.580 --> 01:51:04.580
or

01:51:04.580 --> 01:51:32.020
Okay, boys and girls, that was song number three, Tomoyasu Hote with Frozen Memories.

01:51:32.020 --> 01:51:37.180
see what the folks in the room thought of frozen memories dark Sakura it was

01:51:37.180 --> 01:51:47.580
not too bad but kind of generic solid seven all right angel what'd you think

01:51:47.580 --> 01:51:53.740
of that I liked it eight I thought it was good but not as good as Kelly

01:51:53.740 --> 01:52:01.740
Clarkson seven and a half Logie what'd you think of Tomiyasu hotte I liked it

01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:13.740
It was interesting because I was very tempted to put in a battle without honor and humanity for another time because they had a battle without honor and humanity number 3 which is pretty much the same song.

01:52:13.740 --> 01:52:19.740
This one sounds like it could be from an anime or some sort of video game itself so I give it an 8.

01:52:19.740 --> 01:52:21.740
Alright, and Dan the Man.

01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:25.740
I like the wailing guitar sound, it was totally sweet.

01:52:25.740 --> 01:52:27.740
That song would rule in Guitar Freaks, it really would.

01:52:27.740 --> 01:52:31.400
freaks I would rock and guitar freaks I think it definitely gets at least an

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:37.480
eight maybe eight point seven two five all right totally hard sounds good okay

01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:41.500
guys it's time to vote remember you have to be in our chat room to vote everything

01:52:41.500 --> 01:52:45.240
we have said to this point doesn't matter because it's you guys that make

01:52:45.240 --> 01:52:49.280
the ultimate decision so here it is one more time song number one yoko Kano with

01:52:49.280 --> 01:52:58.480
Rise

okay cool yeah if just see you guys no screw you guys I'm going home if the

01:53:52.220 --> 01:53:55.660
show sounded a little weird just then and you notice we were doing some

01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.700
different stuff with there was a photographer from a local paper that was

01:53:58.700 --> 01:54:02.500
here taking pictures like the past hour he was here yeah he was on webcam so

01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:06.300
people oh so yeah so maybe we'll get to see that but so that's what was going on

01:54:06.300 --> 01:54:11.600
so we're famous we're gonna be famous we'll be the paper all right we'll see

01:54:11.600 --> 01:54:14.720
what happens with that I really hope they got a shot at Jamie while she was

01:54:14.720 --> 01:54:18.920
like in midair doing it yeah they got that they got I saw the camera right

01:54:18.920 --> 01:54:25.760
here like a couple close-up shots of me going you know what's funny is that when

01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:30.720
he first showed up he thought like our whole show was us dancing while talking

01:54:30.720 --> 01:54:38.400
I was like you want us to dance okay dance monkey dance we're like free

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.400
publicly, sure, we'll get out the pad. Let's dance.

01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.400
What else do you want me to do?

01:54:42.400 --> 01:54:44.400
Eh, it's cool. It works out. It's fun.

01:54:44.400 --> 01:54:49.400
Alright, anyway, finish your votes there. Send them over a private message to Sky.

01:54:49.400 --> 01:54:53.400
Loki, as long as you got the microphone there. Tell us what's going on in the sim scene this week.

01:54:53.400 --> 01:54:58.400
Um, not too much as I posted last week. Um, still waiting for some actual sim files to come out.

01:54:58.400 --> 01:55:05.400
I think, if I remember correctly, uh, there is that set-mania pack that's coming out with a bunch of songs called, uh,

01:55:05.400 --> 01:55:09.700
DDR, uh, it's like XXMix or something like that.

01:55:09.700 --> 01:55:17.700
Oh, there's some link on, um, there's some link on the actual, um, BemaniCell site that, um, they have there.

01:55:17.700 --> 01:55:23.900
And they were saying there was gonna be an April 1st release for that, so look for that. There's a whole thread to it.

01:55:23.900 --> 01:55:30.400
And, um, so that'd be pretty interesting. Other than that, um, oh, um, pretty soon.

01:55:30.400 --> 01:55:34.680
And DDRUK is relaunching pretty soon, should be this week actually, I think Monday or Tuesday,

01:55:34.680 --> 01:55:35.680
I can't remember.

01:55:35.680 --> 01:55:40.520
So they're coming back, and DDRMania X is saying that they're coming back at some point.

01:55:40.520 --> 01:55:43.720
But actually, DDRUK, they are saying they're coming back, I think it's Monday, Tuesday,

01:55:43.720 --> 01:55:46.520
I can't remember what exactly the day is on that.

01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:50.440
But they're coming back, so look for good stuff from them.

01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:53.840
Sim Files, I don't really know what the situation is with Sim Files, what they're going to be

01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:57.680
doing because I think the reason they got taken down the first time was because they

01:55:57.680 --> 01:56:01.100
had licensed music on there and that kind of stuff.

01:56:01.100 --> 01:56:02.720
So look forward to that.

01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:03.800
That should be pretty exciting.

01:56:03.800 --> 01:56:06.800
I'm just glad that I'll have more websites to read again.

01:56:06.800 --> 01:56:11.480
And really, other than that, not too much else going on.

01:56:11.480 --> 01:56:14.520
There's some sim files out there that are pretty interesting.

01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:17.420
More crappy remixes, of course, out there.

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:20.300
But they give me some ideas for stuff, so I may look to doing that.

01:56:20.300 --> 01:56:25.600
I've been kind of hitting a musician's block lately, so I haven't been making anything.

01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:35.600
But yeah, lots of fun stuff out there. Go download some music, songs, of course only if you have the CD. And that's it.

01:56:35.600 --> 01:56:43.600
Alright. Okay, we're gonna take the last call for cage match votes now. So hopefully you guys are getting those votes in.

01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:49.600
And, what we're gonna do, we're gonna take a break and we're gonna come back and play Match Game.

01:56:49.600 --> 01:56:54.680

02:03:00.540 --> 02:03:03.540
I'm

But you're sitting at home, on and on on the shelf

02:03:13.940 --> 02:03:16.940
If you want to borrow less, you have to find it yourself

02:03:16.940 --> 02:03:19.940
And so what I'm waiting for is someone waiting for me

02:03:19.940 --> 02:03:22.940
Since summer is the place I really want to be

02:03:22.940 --> 02:03:25.940
My foundation is me, but you need the right thing

02:03:25.940 --> 02:03:28.940
To keep tall and tender, young and handsome, fancy thing made

02:03:28.940 --> 02:03:31.940

02:03:31.940 --> 02:03:34.940
Mark's gonna catch you as you get to the end

02:03:34.940 --> 02:03:38.940
You're gonna make it easier to notice me there

02:03:38.940 --> 02:03:41.940
You may not get a second line

02:03:41.940 --> 02:03:45.940
Mr. Linus, I can't decide, don't you sit down

02:03:45.940 --> 02:03:48.940

02:07:59.800 --> 02:08:03.800
Hello Lemon Lime Jump! Hi!

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:07.300
You are our other contestant for the match game tonight, aren't you excited?

02:08:07.300 --> 02:08:11.440
Yeah, especially since I'm a noob. Hello, noob!

02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:14.800
Hi, noob! This is your only first call at the station, congrats!

02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:19.320
Yes, alright. Okay, so you're going to be playing match game tonight. Now, do you know how match game

02:08:19.320 --> 02:08:19.960
works?

02:08:19.960 --> 02:08:23.520
Yeah, you have to like finish a sentence with a word or a phrase.

02:08:23.520 --> 02:08:26.520
You're already a pro at this, you're not much of a noob, because you already know what's

02:08:26.520 --> 02:08:27.880
going on. Yes, we're going to read

02:08:27.880 --> 02:08:33.200
sentence and it's gonna have a blank in it and it's your job to best answer what

02:08:33.200 --> 02:08:37.520
you think the rest of us are going to put in that blank so without further ado

02:08:37.520 --> 02:08:42.600
let's get some music here for match game we definitely need some background music

02:08:42.600 --> 02:08:47.360
if we're gonna be playing match game unfortunately I don't we don't have the

02:08:47.360 --> 02:08:52.000

Yeah, I hope so.

02:13:11.240 --> 02:13:14.240

02:28:43.400 --> 02:28:44.880
and I want to take it when he's not looking.

02:28:44.880 --> 02:28:48.920
But I wouldn't do that because Dan's my bud.

02:28:48.920 --> 02:28:53.260
Dan's saying over there is he's playing Lumines, he's all, I am always looking, so,

02:28:53.260 --> 02:28:56.860
and I believe it. But Dan was actually telling me that they actually have PSPs

02:28:56.860 --> 02:29:01.940
still in his store. Very few, but a few. Which is weird because I was hearing

02:29:01.940 --> 02:29:06.200
these stories about, oh my gosh, PSPs are sold out everywhere, and you can't get

02:29:06.200 --> 02:29:11.840
one no matter what. Da-da-da. Yeah, Mike, Dan, get Dan a mic. Hey, Lego boy, get Dan a

02:29:11.840 --> 02:29:20.680
The only reason we would have any left was because some weren't picked up by the fools

02:29:20.680 --> 02:29:24.560
who laid down $50 and just decided they didn't want them.

02:29:24.560 --> 02:29:25.560
$50 reserve.

02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:26.560
$50 deposit.

02:29:26.560 --> 02:29:27.560
Wow.

02:29:27.560 --> 02:29:32.960
Oh my gosh, how do people lay down $50 and then forget?

02:29:32.960 --> 02:29:37.200
I mean, maybe the $5 pre-order I can see, but $50, man.

02:29:37.200 --> 02:29:43.540
And I think it was as of this morning, we had three available for sale, and if they're

02:29:43.540 --> 02:29:49.260
still there, you know, when I come in tomorrow morning, I'll be just shocked.

02:29:49.260 --> 02:29:52.620
And do you, do these people get their $50 back or no?

02:29:52.620 --> 02:29:58.220
Yeah, it's, it's, a GameStop reservation is totally refundable, unlike an EB reservation

02:29:58.220 --> 02:30:03.420
that they make you spin in the store because EB sucks.

02:30:03.420 --> 02:30:06.140
Now we have some EB employees that listen to this show, so be nice.

02:30:06.140 --> 02:30:07.140
They can suck it.

02:30:07.140 --> 02:30:09.440
Nice, be nice.

02:30:09.440 --> 02:30:10.440
Can't we all just get along?

02:30:10.440 --> 02:30:11.440
They eat babies, you know.

02:30:11.440 --> 02:30:17.080
That's what EB stands for.

02:30:17.080 --> 02:30:18.560
Isn't there enough hate in this world?

02:30:18.560 --> 02:30:19.560
No.

02:30:19.560 --> 02:30:21.320
I want to spread love here on Orange Lounge.

02:30:21.320 --> 02:30:25.320
GameStop and EB should come together in harmony, and then Best Buy could join in.

02:30:25.320 --> 02:30:26.520
But not Walmart.

02:30:26.520 --> 02:30:27.520
Not Walmart.

02:30:27.520 --> 02:30:29.080
Walmart's evil.

02:30:29.080 --> 02:30:30.720
Screw EB.

02:30:30.720 --> 02:30:31.720
Screw Game Crazy.

02:30:31.720 --> 02:30:37.220
Don't screw with the people who work there because they suffer just like I do.

02:30:37.220 --> 02:30:41.900
You know I went into a game crazy once and I know I was cheating on you Dan I'm really

02:30:41.900 --> 02:30:44.980
sorry but I went into a game crazy because I was having a hard time finding UltraMix

02:30:44.980 --> 02:30:49.620
2 and I went in and I said I want UltraMix 2 but not in a bundle and she's like oh we've

02:30:49.620 --> 02:30:50.780
got the one here with the pad.

02:30:50.780 --> 02:30:53.660
I said not in a bundle.

02:30:53.660 --> 02:30:57.220
You obviously didn't come to my store where we've had ass loads of them forever.

02:30:57.220 --> 02:30:58.660
I didn't.

02:30:58.660 --> 02:31:01.120
As well as red octane ignition pads.

02:31:01.120 --> 02:31:04.320
But I ended up going to the GameStop of the street and I did pick up Ultramix 2 there.

02:31:04.320 --> 02:31:05.820
They just didn't have it at my usual GameStop.

02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:06.820
Fucking A.

02:31:06.820 --> 02:31:07.820
Thank you.

02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:08.820
Thank you, Dan.

02:31:08.820 --> 02:31:09.820
All right.

02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:16.040
We do a little segment, we're going to get into the FUs of the Week here shortly, but

02:31:16.040 --> 02:31:20.080
before we get into that, we're going to get into a segment we'd like to do here on the

02:31:20.080 --> 02:31:27.000
show called the, no, not FNA, we're going to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:31:27.000 --> 02:31:29.680
I know, it's the kiddies one.

02:31:29.680 --> 02:31:31.680
Oh, I don't have the kiddies one, actually.

02:31:31.680 --> 02:31:32.680
Look at the imaging form.

02:31:32.680 --> 02:31:34.680
It's everyone posting pictures of their cat.

02:31:34.680 --> 02:31:36.680
I posted Shermie.

02:31:36.680 --> 02:31:38.680
No, it's not the kiddie post.

02:31:38.680 --> 02:31:39.680
It's bigger than any of those cats.

02:31:39.680 --> 02:31:41.680
Was there enough room on the desktop for that?

02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:42.680
Oh, you need to shut up.

02:31:42.680 --> 02:31:44.680
All right.

02:31:44.680 --> 02:31:46.680
Those of you guys listening to Orange Launch Radio

02:31:46.680 --> 02:31:47.680
for the first time, welcome.

02:31:47.680 --> 02:31:50.680
And DDR Freak, for those that may not know,

02:31:50.680 --> 02:31:53.680
because I think some of our new listeners may be unfamiliar with DDR,

02:31:53.680 --> 02:31:58.680
it's the largest website out there dedicated to Dance Dance Revolution,

02:31:58.680 --> 02:32:03.000
in the video game that really started us off. Although we're about gaming in general now,

02:32:03.000 --> 02:32:08.000
DDR is really what started us off. So we still show our love to DER Freak by honoring their

02:32:08.000 --> 02:32:13.200
post of the week. And you know it's got a forum with what, like 50,000 users? So there's

02:32:13.200 --> 02:32:20.280
always somebody interesting posting. By interesting, you mean stupid, right? Uh, I wasn't gonna

02:32:20.280 --> 02:32:26.400
say that. I just, I just got a call as I see it. I actually had a hard time finding like

02:32:26.400 --> 02:32:33.720
a really stupid post this week so I found a WTF post so here it is this was

02:32:33.720 --> 02:32:40.940
in the DDR console games section and the subject is is anyone this desperate

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:48.540
here's the message I'm am now starting to create step charts on my games that

02:32:48.540 --> 02:32:54.540
aren't the right songs that go with the song like I created PS on max 300 for

02:32:54.540 --> 02:33:00.020
DDR Max. I'm gonna also make Cartoon Heroes and Across the Nightmare. When I

02:33:00.020 --> 02:33:04.960
do this I have the music mute or just have claps in training mode. Does anyone

02:33:04.960 --> 02:33:12.620
else do this or am I just weird? Just weird. So if if I'm understanding that

02:33:12.620 --> 02:33:20.260
post correctly, he mutes the TV. The whole point of DDR is to dance to the song.

02:33:20.260 --> 02:33:22.260
He mutes the TV and creates his own step.

02:33:22.260 --> 02:33:26.260
He has step charts for songs that aren't in the game.

02:33:26.260 --> 02:33:32.260
They did this a long ass time ago when The Legend of Max was coming out and stuff like that.

02:33:32.260 --> 02:33:39.260
They were making, you know, like, Max on Dropout and stuff and putting the steps on there to prepare for it and stuff.

02:33:39.260 --> 02:33:41.260
This has been done before.

02:33:41.260 --> 02:33:48.260
I did that to an edit that I made once just to listen to it, because you remember my really

02:33:49.620 --> 02:33:56.620
evil one that I did to DXY? The Another Edit? It just sounded really cool.

02:34:00.020 --> 02:34:05.720
People really really badly want Cartoon Heroes and USDDR. They will go to great lengths to

02:34:05.720 --> 02:34:11.600
get this song in DDR and it's just it's just a song guys it's just a song and if

02:34:11.600 --> 02:34:14.560
it really means that much to you you'll pay the money get an import PlayStation

02:34:14.560 --> 02:34:24.000
I don't know what to tell you all right let's um go to another segment we like

02:34:24.000 --> 02:34:30.040
to do here called the F use of the week and what do we do during the F use of

02:34:30.040 --> 02:34:33.680
the week we get ranty we do this every single week for you folks that are new

02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.720
to orange lounge radio we set a bunch of people on fire yes all right so it's

02:34:38.720 --> 02:34:41.920
just a chance for us to kind of unload a little bit and feel better by venting um

02:34:41.920 --> 02:34:47.520
so dark Sakura why is it we have to do this every single week

02:34:47.520 --> 02:35:08.740
I don't really have too much in the way of angst tonight, being that I'm in a generally

02:35:08.740 --> 02:35:13.340
good mood, but you know what, Rob?

02:35:13.340 --> 02:35:14.340
What?

02:35:14.340 --> 02:35:16.340
Big F you goes to your bathroom.

02:35:16.340 --> 02:35:18.340
That's all I'm gonna say.

02:35:18.340 --> 02:35:20.340
Alright.

02:35:20.340 --> 02:35:22.340
Oh yeah, an idiot's on the road.

02:35:22.340 --> 02:35:24.340
That's it?

02:35:24.340 --> 02:35:26.340
Yeah, cause I'm in a generally good mood.

02:35:26.340 --> 02:35:28.340
Wow. That's amazing.

02:35:28.340 --> 02:35:30.340
Yeah.

02:35:30.340 --> 02:35:32.340
Okay, well let's move on then to

02:35:32.340 --> 02:35:34.340
Loki.

02:35:34.340 --> 02:35:36.340
Um.

02:35:36.340 --> 02:35:38.340
First off,

02:35:38.340 --> 02:35:40.340
I'd like to say, um,

02:35:40.340 --> 02:35:42.340
if I came at work for taking

02:35:42.340 --> 02:36:11.340
taking so long to get back to me on whether or not I have this job. I understand that you're busy, like, interviewing people because they keep stealing people out of your department, but you know, I would like to know, since you promised me, like, the first week that I would know that week, and then you said, oh, they tell you this week, I meant next week, so then I waited for the next week, and then they still haven't let me know, and they suck. Uh, fuck you and my Legos, because I still can't find that goddamn piece in here. I have ten gallons of Legos, and I can't find this one damn piece, and that sucks, but I'm gonna live. Um...

02:36:11.340 --> 02:36:22.340
Also, um, fuck you drivers, because there's so many bad drivers out there that are not paying attention, even though most of them seem to be women, and, um, OW!

02:36:22.340 --> 02:36:28.340
Nellie gives an F you to me for saying that, and she also gives an F you to me for playing with my Legos.

02:36:29.340 --> 02:36:32.340
And F you to the lack of pie, from her.

02:36:33.340 --> 02:36:35.340
I'm done.

02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:46.740
I'd like to give an FU to the local pizza places for not being open today.

02:36:46.740 --> 02:36:50.420
I realize that it's Easter and it's a religious holiday and people are spending times with

02:36:50.420 --> 02:36:56.020
their families and yada yada but I put in my time with my family this morning and you

02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:59.540
know what you pizza people can do that too is put in your time in the morning and then

02:36:59.540 --> 02:37:03.380
be there to make me a pizza in the evening because I'm lazy and I don't cook not even

02:37:33.380 --> 02:37:40.380
a F.U. to rob for making me play the dancing game and get tired because I'm out of shape.

02:37:41.620 --> 02:37:45.460
Wait until the picture shows up in the paper then he can give me an F.U.

02:37:45.460 --> 02:37:52.460
And I would like to give an F.U. to having to wait to find out if I'm going to get this

02:37:53.740 --> 02:37:57.860
new apartment or not because I don't like waiting. Waiting sucks.

02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:03.860
Alright, let's go on to other folks and their FUs. We'll start it off with DDR Angel.

02:38:03.860 --> 02:38:15.860
FU not being able to find my expansion disc for Final Fantasy XI because, I don't know, I just want to install it all at once and then, you know, do that massive patch download and then just play.

02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:21.720
play I don't want to you know have to find the discs later and install them

02:38:21.720 --> 02:38:27.260
and crap because no just no because that means more downloading patches later and

02:38:27.260 --> 02:38:33.200
I'd rather just do it all at once Evita running out of spring break because I

02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:40.560
want more but I have school this week so damn it and Evita not playing DVR more

02:38:40.560 --> 02:38:44.360
because I really lost my stamina and I really want it back so that means I got

02:38:44.360 --> 02:38:51.360
play more. Yeah. More to come later, bye. Does Dan the Man have any FUs? Let's hear

02:38:53.240 --> 02:38:58.640
some FUs from Dan the Man. Can we get Dan the Man a mic? Logie. FUs, sorry. Do you have

02:38:58.640 --> 02:39:05.640
any FUs of the week, Dan the Man? An FU to me, because I'm addicted to Lumines. An FU

02:39:05.840 --> 02:39:12.480
to Rob, for making me look away from Lumines to answer this question. And an FU to Sony,

02:39:12.480 --> 02:39:19.480
for shoddy quality control and dead pixels. Fix the fucking problem! Fix it! Thank you.

02:39:21.200 --> 02:39:28.200
You're welcome. Back to my game. Let's get to Chat Room FUs. Lezhe Zaku says, F you to

02:39:33.560 --> 02:39:39.620
not being able to find a Konami 2DX controller, new or used, for around $50-$60. Well, that's

02:39:39.620 --> 02:39:44.420
part of the problem. FU to oldmanwinter for making it the coldest winter ever for New

02:39:44.420 --> 02:39:48.620
York. FU to my ever so shitty stamina for holding me back from playing 9-footers in

02:39:48.620 --> 02:39:56.260
DDR. And FU to sucking horribly at playing 2DX in the arcades. DarkTetsuya says a continued

02:39:56.260 --> 02:40:02.100
FU to G4 for killing off the screensavers. And FU to whatever corrupted my extreme US

02:40:02.100 --> 02:40:09.580
data, several months of work, gone. Dark Knight says, my F.U. goes to my job for opening on

02:40:09.580 --> 02:40:14.180
Easter Sunday. Know that the rest of the mall was closed, so we were the only store in the

02:40:14.180 --> 02:40:21.820
mall open today and it was slooooow. SSJ100 Matt says, F.U. not being able to get into

02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:27.360
the anime convention in Arizona. It turns out they only let 850 people in, thus shutting

02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:35.320
out hundreds of anime fans. Wow, that is poor planning. I wasn't pissed. Shame shame. Real

02:40:35.320 --> 02:40:45.600
quick, I'd like to give an F.U. to C. Herpes. I have C. Herpes. It's Herpes coming from

02:40:45.600 --> 02:40:50.880
lobsters. Quit ruining the show. I'm just kidding. Uh, fs200mat also says F.U. to Golf

02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:57.600
for closing the arcade the only day I have off and for Ivan Drago killing

02:40:57.600 --> 02:41:07.160
Apollo Creed gotta love the never-ending Rocky movie marathon on AMC lemon-lime

02:41:07.160 --> 02:41:15.280
jump says f you two websites that don't show up properly in Firefox black

02:41:15.280 --> 02:41:19.400
devil or X says f you to the fact that I haven't been able to listen lately f you

02:41:19.400 --> 02:41:23.400
the fact that it's Easter and I didn't get any candy at all are you sure

02:41:23.400 --> 02:41:26.400
somebody didn't secretly give you a peanut butter cup because they'll be

02:41:26.400 --> 02:41:31.920
really ticked off if they hear that DJ Tyrant says f you to spring break being

02:41:31.920 --> 02:41:36.680
only one week knowing almost for certain that I won't be qualifying at RDC in San

02:41:36.680 --> 02:41:41.180
Diego for in the groove World of Warcraft taking over my life 2d x9 style

02:41:41.180 --> 02:41:45.520
not at my house yet electric Avenue not upgrade needed to DX red and school

02:41:45.520 --> 02:41:51.940
Sephiroth1215 says F you for 1gig memory sticks being so damn expensive and to Best Buy for

02:41:51.940 --> 02:41:57.160
still not sending out my Lumines forcing me to play Metal Gear which is cool but can get

02:41:57.160 --> 02:41:58.420
tiring.

02:41:58.420 --> 02:42:02.740
And they are telling me that I'm mispronouncing Lumines, it's actually Luminous.

02:42:02.740 --> 02:42:05.300
I don't care.

02:42:05.300 --> 02:42:06.980
Sorry.

02:42:06.980 --> 02:42:09.340
I like Lumines better.

02:42:09.340 --> 02:42:10.420
Luminous.

02:42:10.420 --> 02:42:17.420

02:42:35.640 --> 02:42:39.880
a rumor from where I heard because I know they have a segment in there is

02:42:39.880 --> 02:42:43.720

02:42:43.720 --> 02:42:49.780

close to getting a perfect attendance certificate and I didn't get it because

02:43:09.520 --> 02:43:14.520
Because of sickness, oh and all your bases are belong to Robitron 2002.

02:43:14.520 --> 02:43:22.900
MPQ says F you to myself for knowing some obscure Kanji that a lot of Japanese people

02:43:22.900 --> 02:43:25.120
don't when I can't speak any Japanese.

02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:29.520
F you to sampling masters mega for making a really catchy song that I can't find.

02:43:29.520 --> 02:43:33.680
F you to that PSP golf game I preordered that doesn't come out until June.

02:43:33.680 --> 02:43:38.840
And I guess FU did that StepMania theme for changing the pie that I was looking for.

02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:39.840
P.I.?

02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:40.840
Pie?

02:43:40.840 --> 02:43:41.840
I don't know.

02:43:41.840 --> 02:43:47.200
DJ Rama S says, Fuck you to the Parks Department for canceling our photo shoot in Central Park.

02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:48.200
Permit my ass.

02:43:48.200 --> 02:43:50.760
I'm sending Manfay after you.

02:43:50.760 --> 02:43:52.960
Manfay, sorry.

02:43:52.960 --> 02:43:58.360
John Field says, FU to being lazy and not catching up on my schoolwork.

02:43:58.360 --> 02:44:04.860
Rice RYC3 says F you to Planet X slash GameStop for the longest fucking line I've been in

02:44:04.860 --> 02:44:14.340
at the mall for the PSP. The end. Hi guys. And lastly, DJ Takuya says F you for not having

02:44:14.340 --> 02:44:26.760

02:46:53.040 --> 02:46:55.040
From books, from books, from books

02:48:53.040 --> 02:49:10.640
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

02:49:10.640 --> 02:49:18.880
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and we want to get into some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:49:18.880 --> 02:49:20.520
So I guess we're just gonna get right into it.

02:49:20.520 --> 02:49:24.720
I was going to think if maybe there was another news segment we wanted to do, but eh, F the

02:49:24.720 --> 02:49:25.720
news.

02:49:25.720 --> 02:49:28.840
We're just going to get into some Ask Orange Lounge because we want, we want to show our

02:49:28.840 --> 02:49:31.320
listeners a little love and entertain their questions.

02:49:31.320 --> 02:49:35.600
So if you have a question, just head on over to orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and

02:49:35.600 --> 02:49:38.720
once you get in the chatroom, just ask somebody, they'll tell you how to submit a question

02:49:38.720 --> 02:49:43.200
because you already missed me putting in the chatroom how you ask questions.

02:49:43.200 --> 02:49:44.200
But somebody will fill you in.

02:49:44.200 --> 02:49:51.200
We have some nice people in chat.

02:49:51.600 --> 02:49:53.440
Let's ask OrangeLounge

02:49:53.440 --> 02:49:55.060
some stupid question.

02:49:55.060 --> 02:49:58.740
What will we find out tonight on OrangeLounge Radio?

02:49:58.740 --> 02:50:00.580
Something people want to know

02:50:00.580 --> 02:50:02.460
is will we tone it down

02:50:02.460 --> 02:50:09.460
because we got nominated broadcaster of the year and my answer is HELL NO!

02:50:09.460 --> 02:50:18.900
And for those who want to know, yes, the song is supposed to suck that bad.

02:50:18.900 --> 02:50:21.340
Somebody in chat actually asked me, are you guys toning it down tonight because of the

02:50:21.340 --> 02:50:22.540
broadcaster of the year thing?

02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:26.540
And I'm like, no, we're just kind of, I don't know.

02:50:26.540 --> 02:50:28.540
It's the ham, the sedatives and the ham.

02:50:28.540 --> 02:50:32.180
Yeah, actually, I think it is because we've all eaten really well today, even though we

02:50:32.180 --> 02:50:34.260
did not get pie.

02:50:34.260 --> 02:50:35.260
We ate very well.

02:50:35.260 --> 02:50:36.260
Sorry, Nelly.

02:50:36.260 --> 02:50:37.820
Don't be pouty face.

02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:42.020
We've all eaten very well, so I think we're just a little happier today.

02:50:42.020 --> 02:50:45.020
Nelly, please put that on cam.

02:50:45.020 --> 02:50:47.220
OrangeSongsRadio.com.

02:50:47.220 --> 02:50:49.580
Nelly will be showing her LEGO creations there on cam.

02:50:49.580 --> 02:50:56.220
We have a lot of freaking questions to get to in very little time, so let's get to it.

02:50:56.220 --> 02:51:04.380
DJ Takuya says, what are your thoughts on the flyer announcing 2DX12 Happy Sky?

02:51:04.380 --> 02:51:10.060
thought is I like the name but you know what it's just a flyer I can't really

02:51:10.060 --> 02:51:14.100
start forming opinions until I see like some more screenshots and some song

02:51:14.100 --> 02:51:20.620
titles that's my opinion anybody else care to interject I have to say I love

02:51:20.620 --> 02:51:25.340
the flyer so far I just hope the timing on the flyer is still pretty good the

02:51:25.340 --> 02:51:33.740
look kickass about that flyer so goddamn versatile paperwad paper airplane little

02:51:33.740 --> 02:51:42.660
like, you know, Pac-Man thing. Hat. Sailboat. Fucking kick-ass game. If the flyers is cool,

02:51:42.660 --> 02:51:52.260
the game's gotta be awesome. All right. Usually, you're pretty funny. I don't know what happened

02:51:52.260 --> 02:51:58.740
tonight. It is an off night, isn't it? The Legos leached his soul. I guess so. DJTakuya

02:51:58.740 --> 02:52:04.740
What do you think is the future of 2DX for the console with PS3 looming in the future?

02:52:04.740 --> 02:52:10.740
Me personally, I think they'll finish out with 2DX Red at least on the PS2.

02:52:10.740 --> 02:52:18.740
Don't know what will happen after that though. It just kind of depends what new features they start adding into the future 2DX releases.

02:52:18.740 --> 02:52:26.740
Like if we see that 2DX Happy Sky is going to be on this crazy new hardware and stuff, then I'd imagine that's where it's going to upgrade.

02:52:26.740 --> 02:52:30.740
For now, I think I would continue to see it as a PS2 series.

02:52:30.740 --> 02:52:32.740
Maybe that's just me. Any thoughts on that, DarkSakura?

02:52:34.740 --> 02:52:39.740
I don't even want to think about the future systems until I actually have something tangible on them.

02:52:39.740 --> 02:52:42.740
So speculation, I'm not going to.

02:52:42.740 --> 02:52:43.740
Alright.

02:52:47.740 --> 02:52:48.740
Oh, DanTheMan.

02:52:48.740 --> 02:52:52.740
And remember, generally the Bimani games are real slow to adapt to new hardware.

02:52:52.740 --> 02:52:59.240
since the ps3 will be backwards compatible unless they do something

02:52:59.240 --> 02:53:02.700
crazy go nuts with the arcade version you can probably expect to see it

02:53:02.700 --> 02:53:06.580
playable on ps2 for a good long time until they absolutely have to start

02:53:06.580 --> 02:53:13.100
making it for ps3 okay good point all right let's go to a question from black

02:53:13.100 --> 02:53:18.420
devler X what piece is Loki missing I downloaded the zip from the site and

02:53:18.420 --> 02:53:22.140
and notice that I have a lot of the special pieces. Maybe he can describe it.

02:53:22.140 --> 02:53:25.540
I don't want to hear what special pieces Loki's missing from his list.

02:53:25.540 --> 02:53:29.300
Yeah, how is the Lego construction going over there? It's the one that looks like a seat,

02:53:29.300 --> 02:53:34.380
and I'm on step four right now, because I've started running out of black pieces.

02:53:34.380 --> 02:53:38.340
And again, for those that tuned in late tonight's show, Loki is building a charger

02:53:38.340 --> 02:53:39.740
for the Nintendo DS

02:53:39.740 --> 02:53:43.500
out of Legos, and that's something that's actually on the website over at

02:53:43.500 --> 02:53:46.700
www.orangesontradar.com. I have a question for anyone in our chat room.

02:53:46.700 --> 02:53:49.920
How do I freakin' download streaming

02:53:49.920 --> 02:53:53.440
movies as to permanently non-streaming, like recording them?

02:53:53.440 --> 02:53:57.840
Things driving me nuts. Send a private message over to Dark Zulker if you know the

02:53:57.840 --> 02:53:59.260
answer. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

02:53:59.260 --> 02:54:05.860
She'll love you forever and ever. Or send me a freakin'

02:54:05.860 --> 02:54:09.240
non-streaming copy of that new video.

02:54:09.240 --> 02:54:14.960
Um, let's see.

02:54:14.960 --> 02:54:16.960
I'd like to make a comment about the episode 3 trailer.

02:54:16.960 --> 02:54:19.960
Yes, yes, Loki, comment on episode 3 trailer since it came out.

02:54:19.960 --> 02:54:23.960
There is a downloadable version out there, you just have to find it because I have it on my computer at work.

02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:33.960
Alright. RPGKing7 wants to know, my question is for everyone in studio and in the chat room.

02:54:33.960 --> 02:54:37.960
Can anyone give me any good cosplay websites, please?

02:54:37.960 --> 02:54:42.960
I was asked for a job interview I have to cosplay a favorite movie character.

02:54:42.960 --> 02:54:47.480
character hmm interesting I said that's a hell of an interview I got to say but

02:54:47.480 --> 02:54:51.080
okay good cosplay tips favorite movie well who's your favorite movie character

02:54:51.080 --> 02:54:56.240
geez well but go to the thrift store but what if I but the question is about

02:54:56.240 --> 02:55:00.200
cosplay websites are there any good cosplay websites I have a calm cosplay

02:55:00.200 --> 02:55:05.040
calm is there really one okay or you can order some of those cosplay magazines

02:55:05.040 --> 02:55:10.080
that they have you know any the names of any of them one I don't know and it's

02:55:10.080 --> 02:55:18.140
There's also, I think, cospa.net, or.co.jp is C-O-S-P-A, it's a Japanese cosplay site,

02:55:18.140 --> 02:55:19.780
but they have individual pieces there.

02:55:19.780 --> 02:55:20.780
Oh, okay.

02:55:20.780 --> 02:55:21.780
You can see what they look like.

02:55:21.780 --> 02:55:25.000
Um, hopefully some folks in the chatroom can help out with that, too.

02:55:25.000 --> 02:55:27.900
You know, you can sometimes find costume pieces on eBay.

02:55:27.900 --> 02:55:29.420
They sell everything on eBay.

02:55:29.420 --> 02:55:30.420
It's pretty crazy.

02:55:30.420 --> 02:55:32.580
Loki, any help with the cosplay question?

02:55:32.580 --> 02:55:33.580
No, I didn't.

02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:35.580
Yeah, that's what I thought.

02:55:35.580 --> 02:55:36.580
Alright.

02:55:36.580 --> 02:55:38.580
Good luck, bud.

02:55:38.580 --> 02:55:47.580
Get that job. If you're going to dress up as a movie character, dress up as, what did they call her? What was the name of the diva from the fifth element?

02:55:47.580 --> 02:55:54.580
The diva. The diva, was that just her name? I thought she had a name. Dress up as her.

02:55:54.580 --> 02:56:05.580
Alright, Illusion has a question. I heard a rumor that DJ Potato's company will be publishing the next frequency game. Have you heard anything about this?

02:56:05.580 --> 02:56:11.100
I don't think there is a company the closest thing I think you might be

02:56:11.100 --> 02:56:15.380
thinking of is neon FM and the reason why it might be getting mixed up with

02:56:15.380 --> 02:56:19.140
frequency is because freeze-pop is showing up in neon FM you can look at

02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:24.140
the website neon FM calm but I don't know of any frequency amplitude thing

02:56:24.140 --> 02:56:27.960
that he's involved with I mean I guess anything's possible but a rumor is a

02:56:27.960 --> 02:56:32.900
rumor as far as I'm concerned Loki you have anything you want to add to that I

02:56:32.900 --> 02:56:35.900
I honestly didn't know you had a company.

02:56:35.900 --> 02:56:38.900
Um, no, I think he's thinking the NFM to be honest.

02:56:38.900 --> 02:56:40.900
So, no idea.

02:56:40.900 --> 02:56:41.900
And it's definitely not frequency.

02:56:41.900 --> 02:56:43.900
They're still talking about doing like a...

02:56:43.900 --> 02:56:46.900
There's a petition out there for like a new frequency or amplitude game.

02:56:46.900 --> 02:56:48.900
So, I don't know.

02:56:48.900 --> 02:56:49.900
I read a...

02:56:49.900 --> 02:56:50.900
Nothing yet.

02:56:50.900 --> 02:56:54.900
I read an article where someone basically asked if they were doing it for the PSP.

02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:57.900
Sonny said they had no plans too.

02:56:57.900 --> 02:56:59.900
So, probably not.

02:56:59.900 --> 02:57:09.900
Prabha Laguna was the name of the diva. Thank you.

02:57:09.900 --> 02:57:15.900
SSJ100Matt, what's a good price to whore yourself?

02:57:15.900 --> 02:57:21.900
We'll answer just about anything on here. I spent all my money on the PSP this week

02:57:21.900 --> 02:57:28.500
and I need money slash zenny slash gil. How are you going to get gil by being a whore?

02:57:28.500 --> 02:57:30.820
Are you going to whore out your character in Final Fantasy XI?

02:57:30.820 --> 02:57:32.980
I've actually seen people do this in Final Fantasy XI.

02:57:32.980 --> 02:57:37.500
They play the little Taru characters, and then they'll say, we'll do the panic dance

02:57:37.500 --> 02:57:41.260
for 100 Gil.

02:57:41.260 --> 02:57:44.580
Which if you don't, if you've never played Final Fantasy XI, there's this little fruity

02:57:44.580 --> 02:57:47.300
little dance the Tarus do when you type slash panic.

02:57:47.300 --> 02:57:48.300
They go, ah, ah.

02:57:48.300 --> 02:57:49.940
They do this little dance.

02:57:49.940 --> 02:57:52.220
It's really cute, and people always want to see it.

02:57:52.220 --> 02:57:55.100
So I suppose you could always whore the slash panic dance.

02:57:55.100 --> 02:58:03.920
Otherwise, if you're going to whore yourself in real life, for the love of God, use protection.

02:58:03.920 --> 02:58:06.580
Don't reproduce if you're going to be whoring yourself.

02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:09.840
Honestly, don't whore yourself for a PSP.

02:58:09.840 --> 02:58:10.840
It's not worth it.

02:58:10.840 --> 02:58:14.020
PSPs are nice and all, but don't whore yourself for one.

02:58:14.020 --> 02:58:15.020
Totally worth it.

02:58:15.020 --> 02:58:16.020
Whore yourself out.

02:58:16.020 --> 02:58:19.380
A buck a pop if you have to, get a PSP.

02:58:19.380 --> 02:58:20.380
What's the standard?

02:58:20.380 --> 02:58:22.100
50 for a BJ?

02:58:22.100 --> 02:58:31.300
I think it's inflation 50 for an HJ 100 for a BJ sucky fucky five bucky you know

02:58:31.300 --> 02:58:36.620
what just go on the internet and answer like a personal ad from a sugar daddy or

02:58:36.620 --> 02:58:40.520
a sugar mommy maybe you might even find old lady sugar mommy depending on what

02:58:40.520 --> 02:58:45.380
you're into and then you can get anything you want just by putting out

02:58:45.380 --> 02:58:49.380
and you only have to put out for one person and if it is a sugar mommy

02:58:49.380 --> 02:58:53.240
me chances are she doesn't have the organs to reproduce anymore they've you

02:58:53.240 --> 02:58:58.040
know stopped working a while ago so you might look out why did I answer that

02:58:58.040 --> 02:59:05.640
question um I'm an idiot let's see we've got a lot of questions tonight so I'm

02:59:05.640 --> 02:59:10.440
trying to get through some of them here jaded 2005 wants to know my girlfriend

02:59:10.440 --> 02:59:15.040
who is listening wants to know hi girlfriend who's listening wants to know

02:59:15.040 --> 02:59:18.640
how did you come up with your name how do we come up with the orange launch

02:59:18.640 --> 02:59:27.780
Radio name. Guilty! Yes, DarkSakura, how did that work? Basically, DDR Freak Radio was

02:59:27.780 --> 02:59:33.380
taken, actually. That's why we're, no, uh. We were trying to think of Bimani sounding

02:59:33.380 --> 02:59:37.860
station names, and Orange Lounge came out just because, you know, lounge music. Right,

02:59:37.860 --> 02:59:44.060
right. Blah, blah, blah. Um. And we were bored on the part. You got it, and actually we started

02:59:44.060 --> 02:59:47.580
about the same time the DDR Freak, we were around like just throughout the same time,

02:59:47.580 --> 02:59:51.240
so it's just kind of a coincidence there. But with the whole Orange Lounge thing, I

02:59:51.240 --> 02:59:54.720
think we knew that we wanted the central piece of the station to be the talk

02:59:54.720 --> 02:59:58.200
program, so we were trying to think of a Bahmani-related name, because we're not tied

02:59:58.200 --> 03:00:02.000
to any website or anything, so we couldn't be, you know, DDR Freak or DDR

03:00:02.000 --> 03:00:05.640
Spot or Bahmani Style Radio or any of that stuff, so we had to think of something

03:00:05.640 --> 03:00:08.640
independent, and since we knew we wanted to focus around the talk program, the

03:00:08.640 --> 03:00:12.720
lounge name in Orange Lounge just kind of sounded appropriate, and it just

03:00:12.720 --> 03:00:16.980
worked out. So we were named this because Orange Lounge has a good name, which is

03:00:16.980 --> 03:00:21.300
It's really funny because now that we're getting this additional exposure because of the nominations

03:00:21.300 --> 03:00:26.360
on Live 365, people think that we're our lounge music station, like we sit here and we play

03:00:26.360 --> 03:00:27.360
lounge music.

03:00:27.360 --> 03:00:32.000
And don't get me wrong, lounge music's pretty rad, but we're actually video game radio,

03:00:32.000 --> 03:00:34.980
so it kind of throws people, they're like, whoa, I was expecting lounge music, what's

03:00:34.980 --> 03:00:38.020
this geeky stuff?

03:00:38.020 --> 03:00:41.180
I wish we had a more interesting story than that, but that's really just it.

03:00:41.180 --> 03:00:46.500
We just picked a Bomani-related name for our show.

03:00:46.500 --> 03:00:51.220
we can fit in one more question. We'll do it from Legend of Zaku, and sorry to those

03:00:51.220 --> 03:00:54.620
of you guys that also submitted questions, we didn't get to them tonight. I apologize,

03:00:54.620 --> 03:00:59.500
we'll get to them next week, send them in later. Legend of Zaku wants to know, so, now

03:00:59.500 --> 03:01:04.220
that you're moving, and Orange Lounge Radio might have its own room, how do you plan to

03:01:04.220 --> 03:01:10.380
design it? Are you going to use a ferret theme? Well, technically, it won't be just Orange

03:01:10.380 --> 03:01:14.420
Lounge Radio's room, because my new roommate is not related to the station. He knows I'd

03:01:14.420 --> 03:01:18.100
do it, and he thinks it's pretty funny, but he has never been on the show. That'll probably

03:01:18.100 --> 03:01:23.580
change, though, once we move. But it would not be fair to make the room just Orange Lounge

03:01:23.580 --> 03:01:27.340
Radio. It's going to be a computer office. But it probably will be a little bit geeky.

03:01:27.340 --> 03:01:31.780
It probably will have game posters. Maybe, you know what I should do? This would be a

03:01:31.780 --> 03:01:36.820
great idea. Allow the listeners to send us decorations. That way, I don't have to worry

03:01:36.820 --> 03:01:39.380
about it, and people buy me stuff. I like that idea.

03:01:39.380 --> 03:01:40.380
That's an excellent idea.

03:01:40.380 --> 03:01:44.380
Oh, I think that's a great idea. So, the listeners will be decorating the walls of the new studio.

03:01:44.380 --> 03:01:51.880
I like that idea we'll give you guys details on that later thank you and yes

03:01:51.880 --> 03:01:55.540
actually the ferret will be hanging from a noose on the ceiling just high enough

03:01:55.540 --> 03:02:02.080
so that dark soccer can't reach it all right that's gonna do it for tonight's

03:02:02.080 --> 03:02:07.600
ask orange lounge thank you guys very much for submitting your questions and

03:02:07.600 --> 03:02:12.560
that's just about it for tonight's show you guys we're just about out of time

03:02:12.560 --> 03:02:16.560
Thanks so much for tuning in tonight and listening. We hope you had a good time.

03:02:16.560 --> 03:02:20.560
We're gonna go around now and get everybody's final thought.

03:02:20.560 --> 03:02:24.560
DDR Angel, your final thought.

03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:28.560
More DDR this week, please. Just kidding. I can do it on my own, I guess.

03:02:28.560 --> 03:02:32.560
DanTheMan, your final thought.

03:02:32.560 --> 03:02:36.560
Loki, your final thought.

03:02:36.560 --> 03:02:40.560
My final thought is, I'm running out of black pieces.

03:02:40.560 --> 03:02:44.560
It's almost done!

03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:48.560
My final thought is,

03:02:48.560 --> 03:02:52.560
I'm really craving a marshmallow peep right now. And no, I'm not going to microwave it.

03:02:52.560 --> 03:02:56.560
Oh, and I get to touch the PSP. Oh.

03:02:56.560 --> 03:03:00.560
So hot. I'm just going to sit over here and ogle.

03:03:00.560 --> 03:03:04.560
DarkSakura, your final thought? Where are my lasers at?

03:03:04.560 --> 03:03:11.040
all right you're forgetting somebody what sorry

03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:15.760

03:03:30.120 --> 03:03:33.920

03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:39.120
Also, coming to the station very soon, some big changes.

03:03:39.120 --> 03:03:41.800
I know we've been saying that for like the past two months, but we're really serious,

03:03:41.800 --> 03:03:44.520
so we'll let you know about that when time gets closer.

03:03:44.520 --> 03:03:48.360
But for the meantime, I have a PSP to play, so we gotta end this.

03:03:48.360 --> 03:03:58.440

Six feet under

03:04:49.440 --> 03:04:53.440
And I can't still hear her complain

03:05:09.440 --> 03:05:12.440
She pissed so much

03:05:12.440 --> 03:05:15.440
She drove me nuts

03:05:15.440 --> 03:05:21.440
And now I'm happier this way, yeah

03:05:21.440 --> 03:05:25.440
I knew I'd miss her

03:05:25.440 --> 03:05:28.440
So I had to keep her

03:05:28.440 --> 03:05:33.440
She's buried right in my backyard

03:05:33.440 --> 03:05:35.440
That's right folks

03:05:35.440 --> 03:05:40.440
