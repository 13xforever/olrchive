00:00:00,606 --> 00:00:02,967
[SPEAKER_07]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 12th, 2005.

2
00:00:30,848 --> 00:00:32,448
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

3
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,230
[SPEAKER_07]: Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura.

4
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,910
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, brains.

5
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You sound like you're in a good mood.

6
00:00:39,551 --> 00:00:43,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh... Maybe been playing a little too much Resident Evil?

7
00:00:43,512 --> 00:00:44,872
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I've been playing with my puppies.

8
00:00:45,512 --> 00:00:47,893
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went to Dave and Buster's last night.

9
00:00:48,293 --> 00:00:48,913
[SPEAKER_07]: Fun, fun times.

10
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:53,215
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to fill us in in just a minute here, but first let me introduce the one and only, Techmaster Loki.

11
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:54,095
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here.

12
00:00:54,415 --> 00:00:54,795
[SPEAKER_07]: How you doing?

13
00:00:55,035 --> 00:00:55,335
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good.

14
00:00:55,636 --> 00:00:55,796
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

15
00:00:56,796 --> 00:00:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

16
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:00,511
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually we like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?

17
00:01:00,531 --> 00:01:01,312
[SPEAKER_07]: What have you been playing?

18
00:01:01,332 --> 00:01:02,353
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get right into it.

19
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,394
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?

20
00:01:04,534 --> 00:01:04,895
[SPEAKER_01]: Puppies.

21
00:01:06,496 --> 00:01:07,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyday puppies.

22
00:01:08,077 --> 00:01:08,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you been good about it?

23
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:09,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you actually going in there everyday?

24
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:14,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I walk my puppies and clean up their poopy and I make them catch frisbee and earn me money.

25
00:01:15,103 --> 00:01:17,084
[SPEAKER_01]: So I pimp out my puppies to the frisbee people.

26
00:01:17,384 --> 00:01:21,608
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the game is starting to get to the point of it's getting a little irritating having to go in everyday?

27
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:21,868
[SPEAKER_01]: No.

28
00:01:22,308 --> 00:01:22,428
[SPEAKER_07]: No?

29
00:01:23,029 --> 00:01:24,710
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what some people are bitching about.

30
00:01:25,106 --> 00:01:25,466
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm hearing now.

31
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:29,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then they, you know, never had a virtual pet before.

32
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,470
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendogs was not for them.

33
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:33,292
[SPEAKER_01]: They never carried around their pocket Pikachu, damn it.

34
00:01:35,153 --> 00:01:38,456
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played, went to Dave and Buster's last night and played Battletech for the first time.

35
00:01:38,476 --> 00:01:42,719
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that game gave me a headache, made me want to throw up.

36
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,660
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, describe Battletech for those that may not know.

37
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,863
[SPEAKER_01]: You get in these pod things and basically it's like you're in the cockpit of a mech.

38
00:01:49,844 --> 00:01:50,945
[SPEAKER_01]: And you go around killing people.

39
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:52,786
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't like it.

40
00:01:54,426 --> 00:01:59,489
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those games where the screen's up on top and it reflects onto a concave mirror.

41
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:04,931
[SPEAKER_01]: It totally messed with my sense of motion sickness.

42
00:02:05,991 --> 00:02:06,392
[SPEAKER_01]: I played...

43
00:02:07,672 --> 00:02:13,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Lange and the Midnight Maximum tune last night and completely owned my husband.

44
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,621
[SPEAKER_01]: So weird saying that.

45
00:02:15,881 --> 00:02:16,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Your husband!

46
00:02:16,662 --> 00:02:20,046
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been married 10 days and I still have trouble writing my last name.

47
00:02:20,727 --> 00:02:21,988
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't been to the DMV yet either.

48
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:22,629
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

49
00:02:25,752 --> 00:02:34,881
[SPEAKER_01]: I also played a bunch of Tiki games and that was really... Dave Buster's the one place where playing Tiki games can be cool, not like Chuck E. Cheese.

50
00:02:34,901 --> 00:02:38,725
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was trying to save up enough to get new mugs, but they didn't have any mugs, so I just saved my tickets.

51
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:43,830
[SPEAKER_07]: I had enough to purchase an Xbox game or a PS2 game, but I just, I didn't.

52
00:02:45,414 --> 00:02:53,496
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought about getting that racing game that Rockstar puts out, the Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition.

53
00:02:53,776 --> 00:02:55,657
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to play that, I've got it, I think.

54
00:02:56,017 --> 00:02:57,217
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe I'll borrow it and check it out.

55
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:58,597
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a good racing game.

56
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:00,998
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that I've given you back your copy of Silent Hill 4.

57
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:01,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Awesome.

58
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,179
[SPEAKER_07]: I need to play through that.

59
00:03:04,979 --> 00:03:05,879
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, anything else?

60
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Puppies!

61
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:07,960
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki!

62
00:03:09,827 --> 00:03:13,189
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been playing Burnout 3, as per usual.

63
00:03:13,869 --> 00:03:18,772
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I got a copy of Burnout Legends for the PSP, so I've been playing that.

64
00:03:19,293 --> 00:03:24,476
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to tide me over until I get Burnout Revenge this week, which I have on pre-order and already paid for.

65
00:03:25,116 --> 00:03:26,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And that one's going to be awesome.

66
00:03:26,737 --> 00:03:27,918
[SPEAKER_06]: And Burnout Legends is cool.

67
00:03:27,938 --> 00:03:33,441
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of all three games of the original three put together, plus bonus stuff.

68
00:03:34,161 --> 00:03:35,122
[SPEAKER_06]: And I love it.

69
00:03:35,802 --> 00:03:38,404
[SPEAKER_06]: God, you haven't shut up about this Burnout game for like two months already.

70
00:03:39,033 --> 00:03:41,976
[SPEAKER_06]: And then other things I've been playing.

71
00:03:42,036 --> 00:03:44,158
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendogs, of course, I have to take care of Taco.

72
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I do find it a little annoying.

73
00:03:47,882 --> 00:03:51,085
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because he's always hungry, no matter how often I check on him.

74
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,408
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, damn, my dog never got that hungry.

75
00:03:54,688 --> 00:03:59,032
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, why can't you just leave the bowl out for him to eat the damn food and just leave it there?

76
00:03:59,052 --> 00:03:59,593
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean...

77
00:04:00,106 --> 00:04:02,166
[SPEAKER_06]: My dog never went through a bowl of water that quick.

78
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,287
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, what the hell?

79
00:04:03,587 --> 00:04:04,387
[SPEAKER_06]: Water should be free.

80
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,827
[SPEAKER_06]: Why the hell do I have to buy water?

81
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:07,687
[SPEAKER_02]: Because your puppies need special water.

82
00:04:08,068 --> 00:04:08,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fuck them.

83
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:09,628
[SPEAKER_01]: That you buy at the dog store.

84
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:11,828
[SPEAKER_01]: Stupid special water.

85
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:15,629
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to walk to the discount store and get it for, you know, uber cheap.

86
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,249
[SPEAKER_06]: Why isn't there a store where you have to buy toys?

87
00:04:18,289 --> 00:04:20,410
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to find used toys in the street.

88
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:22,330
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, isn't that a little weird?

89
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:23,731
[SPEAKER_01]: I sell that crap.

90
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:26,071
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend got a Dalmatian.

91
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:27,411
[SPEAKER_07]: That's cool.

92
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:29,272
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I heard Dalmatians were unlockable in it.

93
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:30,752
[SPEAKER_01]: She found the fireman hat.

94
00:04:31,052 --> 00:04:31,452
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky.

95
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:32,893
[SPEAKER_01]: Got a Dalmatian named Lala.

96
00:04:32,913 --> 00:04:33,773
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in the street somewhere?

97
00:04:34,693 --> 00:04:34,994
[SPEAKER_01]: Lana.

98
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:41,636
[SPEAKER_01]: She found the... You have to... If you walk around the top perimeter, then you get more rare stuff.

99
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:42,996
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, interesting.

100
00:04:43,556 --> 00:04:45,157
[SPEAKER_01]: The further away you go from home, the better stuff you get.

101
00:04:45,177 --> 00:04:49,938
[SPEAKER_06]: And what the hell are those packages that... I'll be walking and all of a sudden there's a box sitting on the ground.

102
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:52,619
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to shake your leash over it and your dog, you will notice it.

103
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:54,980
[SPEAKER_07]: Pull your dog back and he'll grab it and open it.

104
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:56,888
[SPEAKER_07]: Use the leash to pull back.

105
00:04:56,968 --> 00:04:58,449
[SPEAKER_06]: I was shaking the hell out of my dog.

106
00:04:58,469 --> 00:05:02,291
[SPEAKER_06]: You would have thought that I was trying to kill it or something, and the fucker wouldn't pick up the package.

107
00:05:02,572 --> 00:05:03,893
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got two dogs that I have.

108
00:05:04,193 --> 00:05:09,877
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a Welsh Corgi, and I have Menchie, who's a Shiba Inu, and I didn't realize I have anime dogs now, both of them.

109
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,739
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're both like fish sticks from the trash can.

110
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,162
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Oscar, my wiener dog, who has a Mario hat now, by the way, which I found in the street.

111
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:24,727
[SPEAKER_06]: I have Taco, who has a spike collar, a news hat, and some sunglasses.

112
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:27,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I have the Japanese style collar on Minji.

113
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:27,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Takara.

114
00:05:53,685 --> 00:06:01,067
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like you can do fights against... It's basically like Super Smash Bros., but you can play as Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime.

115
00:06:01,147 --> 00:06:01,967
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, come on.

116
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:02,267
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.

117
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:02,947
[SPEAKER_07]: That's rad.

118
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,647
[SPEAKER_07]: And Optimus Prime turns into a truck and runs over people.

119
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:06,428
[SPEAKER_01]: I find it funny.

120
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:09,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Takara is actually... Takara is a toy maker.

121
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:16,670
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're the ones who put out Transformers and, like, Lika-chan, the little Barbie doll in Japan.

122
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,230
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, she's in it.

123
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,430
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Lika-chan's in it.

124
00:06:19,835 --> 00:06:21,937
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Master Higgins from Adventure Island.

125
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:24,739
[SPEAKER_07]: I hear Bonk is unlockable, so it's pretty cool.

126
00:06:24,839 --> 00:06:25,820
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

127
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,641
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not a new game.

128
00:06:26,681 --> 00:06:27,421
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been out a little while, right?

129
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:30,084
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been out for a couple years, but it's just really weird.

130
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:34,527
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes we discover these little import gems a little late.

131
00:06:35,488 --> 00:06:35,808
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

132
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:39,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, well, you know, we're not in Japan, so we can't do the stuff advertised right away.

133
00:06:39,792 --> 00:06:40,692
[SPEAKER_06]: So, hey, whatever.

134
00:06:40,772 --> 00:06:41,313
[SPEAKER_06]: It's still good.

135
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:46,177
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, of course, I'm putting more money down on my 360, so waiting for that.

136
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:48,138
[SPEAKER_06]: So, lots of stuff.

137
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:48,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

138
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:53,241
[SPEAKER_01]: On GameStop's site, they have a $1,000 Ultimate Bundle.

139
00:06:53,761 --> 00:06:55,361
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we talked about that the week you were here.

140
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:56,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was crazy.

141
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:03,544
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking to the game publishers about that and they were laughing at how ridiculous and stupid it is because most of those games aren't coming out at launch.

142
00:07:04,165 --> 00:07:07,226
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how they're going to get this stuff, but it's not coming out at launch.

143
00:07:07,806 --> 00:07:07,986
[SPEAKER_06]: Ouch.

144
00:07:08,931 --> 00:07:10,433
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to think about that before we pre-order.

145
00:07:10,473 --> 00:07:12,375
[SPEAKER_07]: The games get delayed all the time.

146
00:07:12,395 --> 00:07:16,179
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is going to pay thousands of dollars for some stew for every game?

147
00:07:16,339 --> 00:07:17,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Just buy them as they come out.

148
00:07:18,121 --> 00:07:20,884
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, I'm not interested in that one.

149
00:07:20,924 --> 00:07:22,505
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, rich people.

150
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:23,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Rich people don't care.

151
00:07:24,227 --> 00:07:25,368
[SPEAKER_07]: Paris Hilton, she doesn't care.

152
00:07:25,508 --> 00:07:26,169
[SPEAKER_07]: She just wants her Xbox.

153
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:27,791
[SPEAKER_07]: She doesn't know how to freaking use an Xbox.

154
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:29,252
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

155
00:07:29,633 --> 00:07:30,514
[SPEAKER_02]: She can make sausage.

156
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:33,595
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, my gaming week.

157
00:07:34,295 --> 00:07:35,997
[SPEAKER_07]: I played mostly games that are kind of old.

158
00:07:36,117 --> 00:07:42,443
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of rediscovering old games, I bought .hack a couple weeks ago and I finally like really beginning into it this week and just playing through it.

159
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:44,706
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really a cool little game.

160
00:07:45,126 --> 00:07:46,347
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the story.

161
00:07:46,467 --> 00:07:49,490
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the idea of an MMO, but it's not.

162
00:07:50,691 --> 00:07:51,451
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know, it's kind of neat.

163
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:09,034
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

164
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,822
[SPEAKER_07]: This is seriously one of the greatest GameCube games they put out.

165
00:08:33,043 --> 00:08:35,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just that, it's one of the greatest next-gen games they put out, period.

166
00:08:36,364 --> 00:08:39,406
[SPEAKER_07]: It's such a great game because there's so much to do in it.

167
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:42,988
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to get all the little pieces and read about the characters.

168
00:08:43,008 --> 00:08:43,988
[SPEAKER_07]: There's trophies.

169
00:08:44,428 --> 00:08:47,970
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the single-player mode where you do the adventure.

170
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:51,992
[SPEAKER_07]: There's the mini-games, the little challenges, hit the targets.

171
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:55,274
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many cool little things that just keep this game going.

172
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just, oh man, I just love the game.

173
00:08:58,835 --> 00:09:00,755
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was also rediscovering F-Zero today.

174
00:09:01,056 --> 00:09:07,477
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, I was trying to, because I was hooking up the GameCube again, and I wanted to try out some of these games that support widescreen TV.

175
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:13,018
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm kind of upset, though, because Nintendo does not support component cable anymore.

176
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:16,218
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I want to hook up to my HDTV, I have to use S-Video.

177
00:09:16,498 --> 00:09:21,139
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, S-Video on the HDTV makes things look blurry compared to the PlayStation 2.

178
00:09:21,559 --> 00:09:22,699
[SPEAKER_07]: F-Zero looked blurry!

179
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:26,200
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's kind of upsetting, because F-Zero is a really sharp-looking game.

180
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:27,240
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an awesome-looking game.

181
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:30,362
[SPEAKER_07]: I went to Nintendo's website to try and find a component cable.

182
00:09:30,642 --> 00:09:31,543
[SPEAKER_07]: They stopped making them.

183
00:09:31,783 --> 00:09:32,303
[SPEAKER_07]: Third party.

184
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:35,906
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't even find a third party cable at Fry's or anything.

185
00:09:35,926 --> 00:09:37,927
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I think that Lixing carries them.

186
00:09:37,967 --> 00:09:39,208
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe that's where I'm going to have to go.

187
00:09:39,448 --> 00:09:40,429
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the other weird thing.

188
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:46,714
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, since mid-2004, Nintendo stopped putting the digital output port on the back of the GameCubes.

189
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:55,480
[SPEAKER_07]: If you didn't buy your GameCube before probably when the 79 price drop or whatever it's at now, your GameCube doesn't have this port and you'll never have the component.

190
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:55,600
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

191
00:09:56,016 --> 00:10:02,998
[SPEAKER_07]: It really irks me about Nintendo's lack of next-generation television support.

192
00:10:03,878 --> 00:10:12,841
[SPEAKER_07]: If they're going to go up to the next level with next-gen gaming, and we all heard that story a while back where they're saying Revolution's not going to support HDTV, that really bothers me because, you know...

193
00:10:14,261 --> 00:10:22,229
[SPEAKER_07]: After launch, a couple years after launch, a lot more people are going to be buying these HDTVs and they will be a bigger market share and Nintendo's going to be left out cold.

194
00:10:22,309 --> 00:10:29,116
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially since, you know, I've got these pictures up of the PS3 that I took at E3 with the two HDMI ports on the back.

195
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:30,237
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, very sexy.

196
00:10:30,758 --> 00:10:36,984
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, in case you have two HDTVs sitting next to each other.

197
00:10:37,643 --> 00:10:42,549
[SPEAKER_06]: I know I have five of them sitting next to each other, so that'll be no problem.

198
00:10:42,609 --> 00:10:44,391
[SPEAKER_01]: That makes me think, though, remember the iLink?

199
00:10:45,852 --> 00:10:49,076
[SPEAKER_01]: That probably could be for dual output for multiplayer games.

200
00:10:49,797 --> 00:10:50,357
[SPEAKER_07]: Very possible.

201
00:10:50,678 --> 00:10:51,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Very possible.

202
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:54,602
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, I still love you, Nintendo, but come on, get with the times.

203
00:10:55,063 --> 00:10:58,827
[SPEAKER_07]: It's time to start supporting HD a little better, and I hope they change their mind on the revolution.

204
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,238
[SPEAKER_07]: and remake the component cables.

205
00:11:02,099 --> 00:11:06,482
[SPEAKER_06]: While they're at it, they should drop the price on those plasma TVs because they're too fucking expensive.

206
00:11:06,863 --> 00:11:13,547
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, but I got mine at Costco and it's not a plasma, but it's just an HD regular TV and it's nice.

207
00:11:13,607 --> 00:11:27,378
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that Costco doesn't advertise, which is a very good advantage of buying things from there, no matter how long you have owned something, if anything on it goes wrong, you can take it back and they have to take it back for a full refund or replacement.

208
00:11:27,718 --> 00:11:27,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

209
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if it's 10 years.

210
00:11:33,465 --> 00:11:37,627
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gamers just like you guys out there listening, so we're just telling you guys where to get the good deal.

211
00:11:37,867 --> 00:11:42,569
[SPEAKER_07]: And I shopped around for HDTV, and I seriously felt Costco was the best deal.

212
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,610
[SPEAKER_01]: We like quality for our gaming goodness.

213
00:11:46,391 --> 00:11:50,273
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about some news tonight going into next gen.

214
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:52,834
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's talk about the next generation Sonic.

215
00:11:53,494 --> 00:11:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: They teased it a little bit at E3, but now they are officially announcing...

216
00:11:57,852 --> 00:12:01,615
[SPEAKER_07]: that they are going to be making a next-gen Sonic the Hedgehog game, Sega of course.

217
00:12:02,216 --> 00:12:08,861
[SPEAKER_07]: It's part of their Tokyo Game Show lineup, and Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be coming out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

218
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:13,745
[SPEAKER_07]: No word yet about a Revolution release, but nobody's really talking about the Revolution yet.

219
00:12:13,825 --> 00:12:15,226
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine they will early next year.

220
00:12:16,047 --> 00:12:21,591
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, Sega's also going to be showing them at Tokyo Game Show a mech game called Chromehounds for the 360.

221
00:12:22,191 --> 00:12:23,132
[SPEAKER_07]: Which looks sexy.

222
00:12:24,673 --> 00:12:25,013
[SPEAKER_07]: And a...

223
00:12:26,118 --> 00:12:30,102
[SPEAKER_07]: A Sonic Riders game for Xbox, PS2, and GameCube.

224
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Chromehounds looks sexy.

225
00:12:31,904 --> 00:12:32,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen the pictures of it.

226
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:33,105
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this?

227
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,026
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know much about Chromehounds.

228
00:12:34,086 --> 00:12:34,987
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a mech fighting game.

229
00:12:35,027 --> 00:12:38,850
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just like, you know, just like Armored Core or something like that.

230
00:12:38,870 --> 00:12:39,671
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just really good.

231
00:12:40,312 --> 00:12:41,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Really awesome looking.

232
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:41,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

233
00:12:43,556 --> 00:12:44,797
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta pull the screenshots.

234
00:12:44,837 --> 00:12:46,498
[SPEAKER_06]: They looked really awesome.

235
00:12:46,698 --> 00:12:48,379
[SPEAKER_07]: So what site had the screenshots?

236
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,842
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember, it's not IGN that had the screenshots.

237
00:12:52,242 --> 00:12:53,563
[SPEAKER_06]: As soon as the monitor comes back up here.

238
00:12:54,404 --> 00:13:07,114
[SPEAKER_06]: If I remember correctly, it was I want to say the Xbox360 Updates.com 360updates.com had the screenshots, if I remember correctly.

239
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Looking this up right now.

240
00:13:10,717 --> 00:13:11,197
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there it is.

241
00:13:11,617 --> 00:13:12,178
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, um

242
00:13:12,967 --> 00:13:14,327
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:13:39,828 --> 00:13:41,909
[SPEAKER_07]: 490, man, that's expensive for a cable.

244
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,751
[SPEAKER_01]: Works with GameCubes worldwide.

245
00:13:43,811 --> 00:13:45,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Check if you have digital AV output port.

246
00:13:45,692 --> 00:13:47,753
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, because if you have a new GameCube, you don't have it.

247
00:13:50,315 --> 00:13:51,795
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway, I'm looking forward to the next-gen Sonic.

248
00:13:52,116 --> 00:13:55,338
[SPEAKER_07]: That little video that you were showing before the podcast, Loki, looked very sexy.

249
00:13:55,378 --> 00:14:00,301
[SPEAKER_07]: So I didn't get a chance to go to the Sega Theater at this year's E3 because it was another one of those things that had a line.

250
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,782
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no, actually, the line for the Sega Theater?

251
00:14:02,802 --> 00:14:03,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

252
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:04,423
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent less than 10 minutes in it.

253
00:14:04,483 --> 00:14:04,743
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn.

254
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:09,166
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I was looking at going the last day, and it just was wrapping around the thing, and I just...

255
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:12,023
[SPEAKER_01]: I was around the other side of it.

256
00:14:12,623 --> 00:14:13,583
[SPEAKER_01]: Less than 10 minute wait.

257
00:14:13,723 --> 00:14:14,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

258
00:14:14,804 --> 00:14:15,344
[SPEAKER_07]: Darn you.

259
00:14:15,684 --> 00:14:19,025
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you were waiting in line, they came by and gave you t-shirts or plushies.

260
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:21,346
[SPEAKER_06]: I lost out.

261
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:22,046
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll do it next year.

262
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:24,086
[SPEAKER_01]: They had those nice home theater seatings in there.

263
00:14:24,126 --> 00:14:24,507
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way.

264
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:25,447
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, sorry.

265
00:14:25,487 --> 00:14:25,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So sorry.

266
00:14:26,528 --> 00:14:31,410
[SPEAKER_01]: And just watching it on that screen, they had, oh, we're like, ooh, pretty.

267
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:34,130
[SPEAKER_07]: I did get to play Phantasy Star Universe, so, you know, that's cool.

268
00:14:34,851 --> 00:14:35,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

269
00:14:35,251 --> 00:14:35,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

270
00:14:35,651 --> 00:14:42,213
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the okay from the soon-to-be wife, because our wedding day is going to be about two weeks before E3.

271
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:45,614
[SPEAKER_06]: She says, as long as my company is paying for me to go, it's okay.

272
00:14:46,286 --> 00:14:46,426
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 E3 E3

273
00:14:58,425 --> 00:15:01,166
[SPEAKER_01]: Gunstar Heroes is being re-released Sega Ages

274
00:15:24,945 --> 00:15:32,207
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on, of course, two very, very highly talked about games this year when it comes to handhelds are the two puzzlers, Luminous and Meteos.

275
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:37,128
[SPEAKER_07]: And, of course, very similar because they are developed by the same guy.

276
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:43,690
[SPEAKER_07]: Luminous and Meteos are actually going to be re-released on one handheld system.

277
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:47,491
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll both be available on one handheld system, finally.

278
00:15:47,551 --> 00:15:50,012
[SPEAKER_01]: That handheld system... The Neo Geo Pocket Color!

279
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:50,412
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

280
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:53,853
[SPEAKER_07]: A cellular telephone will be the handheld system.

281
00:15:53,974 --> 00:15:55,915
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, wah, wah, wah.

282
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:57,196
[SPEAKER_07]: In other words, forget it.

283
00:15:57,296 --> 00:15:59,758
[SPEAKER_07]: Because cell phone game ports suck.

284
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:07,544
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute for the nostalgia value for about five minutes, but for the most part, at least here in America, our cell phones, the cell phone games suck.

285
00:16:07,584 --> 00:16:10,507
[SPEAKER_06]: And the single N-Gage owner out there rejoices.

286
00:16:11,948 --> 00:16:13,089
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not coming out for N-Gage.

287
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:14,029
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting a BlackBerry.

288
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:15,931
[SPEAKER_06]: They play mobile phone games, though.

289
00:16:15,971 --> 00:16:16,792
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm playing on a BlackBerry.

290
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:18,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake for life.

291
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,731
[SPEAKER_07]: Snake was the only good cell phone game

292
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:37,798
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys remember, this was something we had talked about when our podcast first started.

293
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:39,019
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was like back in January.

294
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:45,861
[SPEAKER_07]: Playboy Magazine did a spread featuring the Girls of Gaming where they had Topless, Blood Rain, and Melina.

295
00:16:46,461 --> 00:16:47,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Guess what?

296
00:16:47,301 --> 00:16:49,482
[SPEAKER_07]: In October, they're doing it again!

297
00:16:49,542 --> 00:16:50,363
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm gonna buy that issue.

298
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:51,543
[SPEAKER_07]: Just for the show.

299
00:16:53,584 --> 00:16:54,665
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the sacrifice.

300
00:16:54,685 --> 00:16:57,226
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, the sacrifices you have to make.

301
00:16:58,166 --> 00:17:04,289
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are the characters you will be seeing in October's Playboy in the buff, the digital buff, or whatever you want to call it.

302
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,430
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel so stupid talking about this, seriously.

303
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:10,092
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe that it was... Oh my god, digital boobies!

304
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't believe that it was so popular the first time they're doing it again.

305
00:17:14,794 --> 00:17:18,735
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they going to have the hot coffee mod uncensored on this?

306
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:20,996
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea, but here's some of the games.

307
00:17:21,676 --> 00:17:24,677
[SPEAKER_07]: Jackie, who is a cheerleader in Midway's Blitz the League.

308
00:17:25,817 --> 00:17:28,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Carla Valenti from Atari's Indigo Prophecy.

309
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:36,079
[SPEAKER_07]: Capcom's Dark Watch will have Cassidy and Tala, who is a vampire female.

310
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:40,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I might add that Cassidy was killed off in about the first five minutes of the game.

311
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:42,721
[SPEAKER_06]: Her head ripped clean from her body.

312
00:17:43,393 --> 00:17:45,054
[SPEAKER_06]: Playboy Mansion Private Party

313
00:18:05,322 --> 00:18:27,431
[SPEAKER_07]: but Namco doesn't want to be left out they'll have a character from Hellgate London and of course Sony's God of War getting in on it as well I know it's funny everybody's joke about this is they're all what the hell's Hellgate London they're all we don't even know what that game is I've actually never heard of this myself and I'm kind of reading this going okay must be some game I just haven't heard of I can't play them all anyway

314
00:18:28,574 --> 00:18:30,455
[SPEAKER_06]: What was the original spread called before?

315
00:18:31,156 --> 00:18:31,556
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

316
00:18:32,016 --> 00:18:33,937
[SPEAKER_07]: Digital... I just closed the story.

317
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:36,459
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do any more research on this.

318
00:18:36,519 --> 00:18:37,359
[SPEAKER_07]: It lowers your IQ.

319
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:42,562
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a very interesting story I think we ought to talk about here.

320
00:18:43,783 --> 00:18:45,424
[SPEAKER_07]: Because this affects us here in California.

321
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:48,146
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, Orange Lounge Radio, we're based out of Sacramento, California.

322
00:18:49,406 --> 00:18:51,367
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do have a worldwide audience.

323
00:18:51,548 --> 00:18:53,369
[SPEAKER_07]: But this is something that's going on in California.

324
00:18:53,389 --> 00:18:57,411
[SPEAKER_07]: And California's kind of been known to set the tone for the rest of the nation sometimes when it comes to certain bills.

325
00:18:58,155 --> 00:18:59,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Assembly Bill 1179.

326
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:09,099
[SPEAKER_07]: This is the bill that Assemblyman Leland Yee was kind of behind a couple months ago when the hot coffee thing was really big.

327
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:16,662
[SPEAKER_07]: It prohibits retailers from selling violent games to minors or else they'll be fined $1,000 for each violation.

328
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:22,944
[SPEAKER_07]: It passed in the California Senate by a vote of 22 to 9 and it passed in the Assembly 65 to 7.

329
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,245
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's now sitting on Governor Schwarzenegger's

330
00:19:27,429 --> 00:19:33,234
[SPEAKER_07]: and speaking of feeling like an idiot saying something, Governor Schwarzenegger's desk right now waiting to be signed.

331
00:19:33,314 --> 00:19:36,036
[SPEAKER_07]: He must sign or veto the bill by October 9th.

332
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:45,380
[SPEAKER_07]: No word yet on which way he'll go, but probably, considering the fairly overwhelming support, he will probably sign this bill.

333
00:19:45,981 --> 00:19:48,282
[SPEAKER_07]: And it would go into effect January 1st, 2006.

334
00:19:50,424 --> 00:20:03,034
[SPEAKER_07]: By the way, the bill will also require that the games be labeled as being for sale to adults only by a solid 18 sticker, no smaller than 2 inches by 2 inches, on the front of the package.

335
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:09,402
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's very interesting because if you think about it a Game Boy Advance game is only 5 inches by 5 inches the packaging.

336
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:11,904
[SPEAKER_07]: So a little 18 sticker would take up like half the box.

337
00:20:12,624 --> 00:20:17,647
[SPEAKER_07]: The bill also makes no mention of the current ESRB system.

338
00:20:18,308 --> 00:20:30,795
[SPEAKER_07]: So the bill defines its own means of a violent video game saying a video game in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.

339
00:20:32,256 --> 00:20:33,597
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that goes for all of them.

340
00:20:34,465 --> 00:20:35,505
[SPEAKER_07]: Bye-bye all fighting games.

341
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:36,126
[SPEAKER_01]: It's retarded.

342
00:20:51,671 --> 00:20:55,133
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks is going gold.

343
00:20:55,893 --> 00:21:00,915
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, this was a game that, uh, I played a little bit at E3 and I actually kind of enjoyed it.

344
00:21:01,515 --> 00:21:04,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, didn't think I would, um, but it's actually kind of cool.

345
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:10,179
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a neat little, um, it's not like a typical Mortal Kombat game because it's more of like a 3D adventure type thing.

346
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:14,661
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, or I shouldn't say 3D, but, uh, yeah, 3D ISO, you know, perspective type game.

347
00:21:15,231 --> 00:21:21,416
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, where you're just, you know, going around killing things, which will probably be one of the first games to carry an 18 sticker, by the way.

348
00:21:23,517 --> 00:21:30,722
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, and that game has recently gone gold, and it'll be coming out for $49.99 on September 19th.

349
00:21:30,842 --> 00:21:31,423
[SPEAKER_07]: That's next week.

350
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,324
[SPEAKER_01]: Our UK listeners get it on the 23rd.

351
00:21:33,765 --> 00:21:34,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

352
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:35,286
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not next week.

353
00:21:36,907 --> 00:21:38,108
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll be a week after Monday.

354
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:39,248
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

355
00:21:39,749 --> 00:21:39,929
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

356
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:39,989
[SPEAKER_07]: Ha!

357
00:21:41,462 --> 00:21:43,783
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, what kind of news do you have for us tonight?

358
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,523
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just checking the UK release dates.

359
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:48,264
[SPEAKER_07]: I did see on the 16th, E6 comes out on PlayStation 2.

360
00:21:48,304 --> 00:21:49,145
[SPEAKER_07]: Burnout Revenge on the 23rd.

361
00:22:02,598 --> 00:22:05,181
[SPEAKER_01]: ER The Game for PC on the 23rd.

362
00:22:05,542 --> 00:22:06,964
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some pretty neat stuff.

363
00:22:07,004 --> 00:22:08,125
[SPEAKER_01]: Meteos on the 23rd.

364
00:22:08,526 --> 00:22:10,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of stuff coming out on the 23rd.

365
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,236
[SPEAKER_01]: Including Myst5, Mortal Kombat, Rugby Challenge 2006, and Sniper Elite.

366
00:22:18,078 --> 00:22:18,839
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some pretty good stuff.

367
00:22:18,919 --> 00:22:25,104
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, Advance Wars DS comes out on the 30th there too, as well as Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow on the 29th.

368
00:22:25,444 --> 00:22:27,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Advance Wars DS is one of those games I've got to pick up.

369
00:22:27,386 --> 00:22:30,008
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been hearing a lot of good things about it, so I want to check it out.

370
00:22:30,168 --> 00:22:33,511
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got the other two, it has a tie-in on there.

371
00:22:33,551 --> 00:22:34,972
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, you get more options in the shop.

372
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:37,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, like if you put the Advance game in the bottom slot?

373
00:22:37,394 --> 00:22:37,595
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

374
00:22:37,635 --> 00:22:38,375
[SPEAKER_07]: Very cool.

375
00:22:38,555 --> 00:22:41,178
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm liking this DS interacting with the other ports.

376
00:22:41,298 --> 00:22:41,458
[SPEAKER_07]: Good.

377
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:48,672
[SPEAKER_01]: Another game, checking out Yahoo UK and Ireland games, is Winx Club.

378
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami's putting out a Winx Club game.

379
00:22:51,574 --> 00:22:52,074
[SPEAKER_02]: Hooray.

380
00:22:53,155 --> 00:22:54,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so cute, I guess.

381
00:22:54,876 --> 00:22:55,256
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

382
00:22:56,397 --> 00:23:04,622
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, Date for Animal Crossing DS, which is going to be renamed Wild World for a release.

383
00:23:04,942 --> 00:23:06,062
[SPEAKER_01]: It says first quarter 2006.

384
00:23:06,143 --> 00:23:10,985
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, so the whole game itself is going to be called Wild World in Europe?

385
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:11,606
[SPEAKER_01]: I think...

386
00:23:12,472 --> 00:23:13,754
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

387
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:30,945
[SPEAKER_07]: Just stuff on the Silent Hill movie.

388
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see because I found a release date on it.

389
00:23:59,142 --> 00:24:02,243
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to take this as a tentative date because I haven't seen too much official.

390
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:07,327
[SPEAKER_01]: According to BloodyDisgusting.com, it says... Great website name.

391
00:24:07,807 --> 00:24:09,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's... I know.

392
00:24:09,228 --> 00:24:11,049
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want your zombie movies, that's the place to go.

393
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:11,489
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

394
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:13,631
[SPEAKER_01]: April 21st, 2006.

395
00:24:15,252 --> 00:24:15,712
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be there.

396
00:24:16,753 --> 00:24:17,873
[SPEAKER_01]: You know I will be there.

397
00:24:18,194 --> 00:24:18,654
[SPEAKER_07]: Absolutely.

398
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:44,491
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, there was an article, an interview up on IGN, where it was, I can never pronounce this guy's name, Patrick Tatopoulos, I guess, was stating that the director had told him to make, in fact, I'm going to quote, Patrick, I want those guys to look like they are made of plastic, which is exactly the opposite of what we try to do usually.

399
00:24:44,511 --> 00:24:45,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

400
00:24:46,673 --> 00:24:52,058
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going for a very surreal, very this-can't-really-happen look.

401
00:24:52,918 --> 00:24:58,423
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of what they're trying to do is they're having to redevelop some technology for it.

402
00:24:58,563 --> 00:25:00,325
[SPEAKER_07]: Please be a video game movie that doesn't suck.

403
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:01,026
[SPEAKER_07]: Please, please, please.

404
00:25:01,746 --> 00:25:05,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Checking the scenery, though, it's at least going to visually be right.

405
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:09,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Reading the storyline so far, it's going to be pretty dead on.

406
00:25:09,873 --> 00:25:10,254
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see.

407
00:25:11,335 --> 00:25:11,655
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

408
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:12,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks for watching!

409
00:25:26,886 --> 00:25:32,709
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen a picture of somebody who had picked up We Heart Katamari from Target this weekend.

410
00:25:33,209 --> 00:25:37,371
[SPEAKER_07]: We Heart Katamari is not supposed to be out until when?

411
00:25:37,411 --> 00:25:38,172
[SPEAKER_07]: Like later this month?

412
00:25:38,472 --> 00:25:38,952
[SPEAKER_07]: The 21st.

413
00:25:38,992 --> 00:25:41,554
[SPEAKER_07]: The 21st is when We Heart Katamari is supposed to be out.

414
00:25:41,594 --> 00:25:47,097
[SPEAKER_07]: So we were curious if Target broke street or if this image was photoshopped or what have you.

415
00:25:47,217 --> 00:25:51,559
[SPEAKER_01]: And on Target's website it says they're not going to have the game through their website until the 22nd.

416
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,280
[SPEAKER_07]: Electrolytes?

417
00:26:19,944 --> 00:26:22,825
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.

418
00:26:22,965 --> 00:26:24,585
[SPEAKER_07]: It's We Love Katamari.

419
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:26,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me check.

420
00:26:26,345 --> 00:26:26,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.

421
00:26:27,985 --> 00:26:28,986
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, SD.

422
00:26:29,026 --> 00:26:30,226
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are on the next pile.

423
00:26:30,526 --> 00:26:34,106
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry, what was the game again?

424
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,047
[SPEAKER_07]: It's We Love Katamari.

425
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:38,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we have one left.

426
00:26:39,287 --> 00:26:40,327
[SPEAKER_07]: You do have one left in stock?

427
00:26:40,628 --> 00:26:41,048
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, we do.

428
00:26:41,228 --> 00:26:41,848
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, great.

429
00:26:41,888 --> 00:26:42,148
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.

430
00:26:43,288 --> 00:26:43,808
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, bye-bye.

431
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:45,508
[SPEAKER_07]: So get that.

432
00:26:45,548 --> 00:26:49,029
[SPEAKER_07]: This store actually admitted that they had one left in stock on the shelf.

433
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:49,951
[SPEAKER_07]: Go figure.

434
00:26:50,772 --> 00:26:57,076
[SPEAKER_07]: So some copies of We Heart Katamari are getting out there a little bit early.

435
00:26:57,277 --> 00:27:03,981
[SPEAKER_07]: So hopefully some of our listeners of the live program ran out there to the store and probably picked up that last copy already, but we'll see.

436
00:27:04,402 --> 00:27:07,644
[SPEAKER_01]: I did confirm that at least none of the local GameStops have gotten it.

437
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:08,625
[SPEAKER_07]: None of the local GameStops.

438
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:10,406
[SPEAKER_07]: So we actually called some targets around here.

439
00:27:10,486 --> 00:27:14,709
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the targets around here said that they would be putting the game out on shelves Tuesday.

440
00:27:15,089 --> 00:27:15,329
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.

441
00:27:15,489 --> 00:27:17,930
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is very interesting, because the game wasn't supposed to be out until the 21st.

442
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:21,492
[SPEAKER_07]: So, are they doing an early... Did the release get bumped up?

443
00:27:21,592 --> 00:27:22,052
[SPEAKER_07]: Who knows?

444
00:27:22,272 --> 00:27:24,073
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you are... Not officially.

445
00:27:24,253 --> 00:27:28,755
[SPEAKER_07]: If you are hearing stories about We Heart Katamari getting out there early, it is possible.

446
00:27:29,795 --> 00:27:31,476
[SPEAKER_07]: We called them, and sure enough, they're selling it.

447
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:33,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

448
00:27:33,977 --> 00:27:34,837
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get to the mailbag.

449
00:27:35,017 --> 00:27:36,378
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do tonight's mailbag, shall we?

450
00:27:37,558 --> 00:27:41,940
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, you can always send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orange lounge radio dot com. ...

451
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:46,553
[SPEAKER_07]: We only have one email tonight.

452
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:15,063
[SPEAKER_07]: Seriously, once again you frothed with rage about parents' responsibilities totally ignoring the point that consumers have a right to be informed.

453
00:28:15,583 --> 00:28:22,627
[SPEAKER_07]: To utilize your oft-used movie analogy, let's say Paramount produces a flick called Loki Has Brain Damage.

454
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:29,265
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes through the MPAA and ends up rated R for violence, foul language, and excessive retardation.

455
00:28:29,905 --> 00:28:33,529
[SPEAKER_07]: I always allow my 12 year old to see R rated movies so I let him go.

456
00:28:34,189 --> 00:28:40,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Now unbeknownst to the rating board, Paramount secretly slips 5 minutes of close up anal penetration at the end of the credits.

457
00:28:41,396 --> 00:28:46,600
[SPEAKER_07]: This hot anal action actually means that this film should have received an NC-17 rating.

458
00:28:47,341 --> 00:28:48,782
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't want my kid to see this.

459
00:28:49,222 --> 00:28:50,864
[SPEAKER_07]: I had been duped as a consumer.

460
00:28:51,525 --> 00:28:54,047
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an identical situation to the hot coffee mod.

461
00:28:54,148 --> 00:29:01,515
[SPEAKER_07]: If a parent decides that they will allow their children to play a game rated M, that is not the same as allowing their children to play a game rated AO.

462
00:29:01,975 --> 00:29:02,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Get it?

463
00:29:03,737 --> 00:29:04,017
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki?

464
00:29:04,337 --> 00:29:04,677
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong.

465
00:29:04,978 --> 00:29:06,359
[SPEAKER_06]: That's completely wrong.

466
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:12,345
[SPEAKER_06]: Because unlike the hot coffee mod, you had to put in external... Okay, you had to have a third-party cheat device in order to see it.

467
00:29:12,385 --> 00:29:15,267
[SPEAKER_06]: In other words, I would have had to purchase special...

468
00:29:15,998 --> 00:29:17,760
[SPEAKER_06]: I can see it both ways.

469
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: In one way, let the buyer beware.

470
00:29:37,887 --> 00:29:45,789
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there is always a degree of caution that someone has to make with any purchase.

471
00:29:46,690 --> 00:30:06,296
[SPEAKER_01]: However, really, and I think that when you're dealing with how many different departments you have with the game publisher, being that I know many people now who work for various publishers, what the programmers leave in

472
00:30:07,014 --> 00:30:25,647
[SPEAKER_01]: is not necessarily going to be found by the testers unless, you know, you've got... True, the testers are playing on debug units and they are meant to break the game every way they can, do everything possible, and are given usually a set assignment for how the game should be played when they're testing it.

473
00:30:26,548 --> 00:30:34,374
[SPEAKER_01]: However, something that is programmed into a game that has had that bit of programming removed to access it

474
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:36,659
[SPEAKER_01]: on average it's not going to be found.

475
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:44,233
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is very likely that nobody except the programmers had any idea that this was in the game.

476
00:30:45,157 --> 00:30:54,022
[SPEAKER_01]: and that some random person, it could have been found by some random person who said, oh, wow, look what I just found coding for in the game.

477
00:30:54,702 --> 00:31:00,985
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and if they find it on PC, of course, you know, the PlayStation one came after the PC one when they said, oh, it's here.

478
00:31:01,346 --> 00:31:02,486
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see if it's in here.

479
00:31:02,726 --> 00:31:04,968
[SPEAKER_01]: Or it could just be a programmer going, oh, look what I did.

480
00:31:06,469 --> 00:31:11,455
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a very similar thing to what I've always said is that the programmers put it in there and they made a decision to take it out.

481
00:31:11,575 --> 00:31:14,438
[SPEAKER_07]: I imagine somebody at Rockstar said, you know what?

482
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:15,920
[SPEAKER_07]: This is crossing the line.

483
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:17,282
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to get us an AO.

484
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,503
[SPEAKER_07]: Take this out of the game.

485
00:31:18,623 --> 00:31:22,248
[SPEAKER_07]: And what the programmers did, instead of actually physically removing it from the game, they just took out the pointer.

486
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:23,269
[SPEAKER_07]: Easier, right?

487
00:31:23,489 --> 00:31:24,190
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot easier.

488
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:24,911
[SPEAKER_01]: And it also keeps...

489
00:31:25,451 --> 00:31:30,733
[SPEAKER_01]: instead of having to rewrite part of the code, it's slightly easier to remove part of it and make sure that your game ships on date.

490
00:31:30,873 --> 00:31:32,073
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know what?

491
00:31:32,153 --> 00:31:39,255
[SPEAKER_07]: But here's the thing, you know, so to try and get past this here, because we could talk about this until we're blue in the face, rest assured this will never happen again.

492
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,116
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not the first game this has happened with either.

493
00:31:41,256 --> 00:31:41,696
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no, no, no.

494
00:31:41,876 --> 00:31:42,336
[SPEAKER_01]: Bloody Roar 3.

495
00:31:42,396 --> 00:31:43,216
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

496
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:49,618
[SPEAKER_01]: You put it in debug mode, you get necky, you know, masturbatory photos of the characters in the game.

497
00:31:49,758 --> 00:31:54,140
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd even talked about last week, a little more innocent, the hidden song in DDR, quote unquote.

498
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:54,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Although...

499
00:31:55,433 --> 00:32:07,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Some folks have actually sent me an email that linked me to a thread on DDR Freak where some inside sources are saying that that song is actually supposed to be unlockable, just nobody's figured it out yet, but I don't know.

500
00:32:08,017 --> 00:32:10,858
[SPEAKER_07]: If nobody's unlocked it at this point, I don't think they're going to, so whatever.

501
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:11,618
[SPEAKER_07]: But...

502
00:32:13,837 --> 00:32:19,841
[SPEAKER_07]: The point is that basically it was a lazy programming issue and it's brought this whole debate to the front.

503
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:24,585
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that there was a large portion of Rockstar that didn't realize that this was going to be found.

504
00:32:24,605 --> 00:32:25,926
[SPEAKER_07]: They did not intend for this to be found.

505
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:26,326
[SPEAKER_07]: It did.

506
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:37,294
[SPEAKER_07]: Now they're taking the heat for it and rest assured this lazy programming incident will never happen again because that testing process will be changed to prevent this from ever happening to a future game because Rockstar's taking a lot of heat for it.

507
00:32:37,555 --> 00:32:37,895
[SPEAKER_07]: Should they?

508
00:32:37,955 --> 00:32:38,355
[SPEAKER_07]: Shouldn't they?

509
00:32:38,495 --> 00:32:38,876
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

510
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:43,319
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not an easy answer because you could say

511
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,777
[SPEAKER_07]: Were they ignorant or did they know what they were doing?

512
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:47,558
[SPEAKER_07]: We don't know.

513
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:52,201
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the movie analogy, remember the rescuers?

514
00:32:54,283 --> 00:32:56,845
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they always say they put sex things in the Disney movies and stuff.

515
00:32:57,538 --> 00:32:58,639
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it in Roger Rabbit.

516
00:32:58,699 --> 00:32:59,920
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

517
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:06,825
[SPEAKER_01]: But the thing is that the only way that this would have ever really been... The average eye is going to see it as a blip across the screen.

518
00:33:07,085 --> 00:33:07,346
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.

519
00:33:07,506 --> 00:33:13,050
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, one time I was watching a cartoon that I used to tape when I lived in Alabama.

520
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:13,971
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what it was.

521
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:16,012
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw the color changed weirdly.

522
00:33:16,673 --> 00:33:19,895
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back and freestramed it on a picture of the American flag.

523
00:33:21,777 --> 00:33:23,398
[SPEAKER_01]: The animators just happened to stick in there.

524
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:26,867
[SPEAKER_01]: or even places where there were missing frames.

525
00:33:27,348 --> 00:33:30,517
[SPEAKER_01]: The average person isn't going to see that unless they take an effort to go back and look at it.

526
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:58,739
[SPEAKER_06]: and if this person is saying that they monitor what their kids are watching obviously for them to go have a third party cheat device cheat in the game then go into this you're not monitoring what your kids are doing so you know what you're the blame still and you know what you can't come and bitch about you know Rockstar saying oh no oh this wasn't supposed to be in the game the game's maturity it's for over 17 you know what adults only is over 18 one year difference

527
00:33:59,324 --> 00:34:00,305
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking nothing.

528
00:34:00,345 --> 00:34:02,466
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the difference between PG and PG-13.

529
00:34:02,726 --> 00:34:04,447
[SPEAKER_06]: There is really no difference.

530
00:34:04,927 --> 00:34:05,587
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what?

531
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,148
[SPEAKER_06]: You really should be monitoring what your kids are watching.

532
00:34:08,168 --> 00:34:09,769
[SPEAKER_06]: You shouldn't be playing the games in the first place.

533
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:14,532
[SPEAKER_06]: If you let them go to R-rated movies anyways, they're probably seeing real boobies in those R-rated films.

534
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,314
[SPEAKER_06]: And this pixelated representation of what is supposed to be sex, and mind you...

535
00:34:20,149 --> 00:34:25,814
[SPEAKER_06]: The Carl Johnson character, the main male in it, does not get naked in this because it was unfinished.

536
00:34:26,015 --> 00:34:27,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Does not get naked, only the woman.

537
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:32,241
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not even, oh my god, they saw, you know, penis and ass, you know.

538
00:34:32,661 --> 00:34:35,904
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just pixelated boobies, okay?

539
00:34:36,264 --> 00:34:38,947
[SPEAKER_06]: And mature rated games like God of War that have

540
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:40,449
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

541
00:34:56,690 --> 00:35:00,254
[SPEAKER_07]: This, you did not, nobody knew that there would be the sex thing in the game.

542
00:35:00,414 --> 00:35:09,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry, you know, calling, you know, the racist people, murdering the blacks and stuff, and the gang violence, that's okay, but you know, boobies, not okay.

543
00:35:09,625 --> 00:35:10,145
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

544
00:35:10,165 --> 00:35:10,746
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.

545
00:35:10,806 --> 00:35:15,872
[SPEAKER_01]: But in defense, in defense though, I do think that Rockstar was at fault.

546
00:35:16,863 --> 00:35:18,545
[SPEAKER_07]: Because of a lazy programmer, yes.

547
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:19,445
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

548
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:30,975
[SPEAKER_01]: And no matter who it is in the company, as long as that game was released, that company has a legal requirement to make sure that the product that they've put out on the market is exactly what they are advertising.

549
00:35:31,696 --> 00:35:35,780
[SPEAKER_07]: I agree, and that's where I think you're getting a little off, Loki, is because this is the issue.

550
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,322
[SPEAKER_07]: The issue is not, oh my god, somebody saw Digitized Boobies.

551
00:35:38,702 --> 00:35:42,185
[SPEAKER_07]: But the issue is that Rockstar did not tell anyone that that was in the game.

552
00:35:42,205 --> 00:35:46,349
[SPEAKER_07]: Whereas with God of War, they said, yeah, full-on female boobies everywhere.

553
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,233
[SPEAKER_07]: But with this game, they said, oh, there's no sex.

554
00:35:50,253 --> 00:35:54,236
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, you can blow people's heads off with rocket launchers, whatever, but there is no hardcore sex in the game.

555
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:55,157
[SPEAKER_07]: It is bonus.

556
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:58,080
[SPEAKER_07]: There was hardcore sex in the game.

557
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,361
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I everything?

558
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,123
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm going to be a parent in a couple years.

559
00:36:02,263 --> 00:36:02,464
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

560
00:36:03,667 --> 00:36:09,334
[SPEAKER_01]: When you buy something that, and trust me, I remember fully well what a devious little child I was.

561
00:36:10,596 --> 00:36:13,279
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not the end of your responsibility.

562
00:36:15,126 --> 00:36:16,707
[SPEAKER_01]: There is such a thing called maintenance.

563
00:36:17,087 --> 00:36:17,367
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

564
00:36:17,407 --> 00:36:20,288
[SPEAKER_07]: We got to move on because we could beat this top of the ground.

565
00:36:20,308 --> 00:36:21,509
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just, you know, I hate hearing it.

566
00:36:21,569 --> 00:36:24,370
[SPEAKER_01]: I say from here on out, no more hot coffee ever.

567
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:25,471
[SPEAKER_07]: Or take it to the forums.

568
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:27,612
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go to our website.

569
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:28,772
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

570
00:36:28,872 --> 00:36:30,633
[SPEAKER_07]: Send Loki a personal email.

571
00:36:30,693 --> 00:36:32,174
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

572
00:36:32,194 --> 00:36:35,395
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just personally sick of these people going, are you a rock star?

573
00:36:35,535 --> 00:36:36,756
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

574
00:36:55,371 --> 00:36:56,692
[SPEAKER_07]: Certainly violence being advertised.

575
00:36:56,712 --> 00:37:01,576
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think that in the end it shouldn't be the responsibility of the video game company to censor their product.

576
00:37:01,976 --> 00:37:06,639
[SPEAKER_01]: However, I do think they should make sure that the consumer is fully aware of the product that they're purchasing.

577
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I can agree with that.

578
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:07,740
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

579
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:08,560
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

580
00:37:08,801 --> 00:37:09,121
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

581
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:12,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about... The only hot coffee I ever want to see is the kind I get at Starbucks.

582
00:37:12,983 --> 00:37:13,304
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

583
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:14,645
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's move on.

584
00:37:14,905 --> 00:37:22,390
[SPEAKER_07]: Speaking of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, that re-release without the coffee mod, it will be coming out next week.

585
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:23,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Um...

586
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:28,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Which I suppose, as a little footnote to the story, look how long it took for that patch to come out.

587
00:37:28,722 --> 00:37:33,406
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how long this game would have been delayed if they'd gone back and done what they should have done.

588
00:37:34,366 --> 00:37:35,187
[SPEAKER_07]: Just food for thought.

589
00:37:39,263 --> 00:37:43,347
[SPEAKER_07]: Murder in China based on a MMORPG.

590
00:37:43,447 --> 00:37:53,235
[SPEAKER_07]: According to the Beijing Morning Post, a young woman has been charged with murdering her fiancé for, quote, too much time playing online games.

591
00:37:53,856 --> 00:37:54,576
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's it.

592
00:37:54,817 --> 00:37:56,898
[SPEAKER_07]: No more online games for the Chinese.

593
00:37:57,279 --> 00:37:57,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Ever.

594
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:58,720
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop.

595
00:38:00,485 --> 00:38:09,888
[SPEAKER_07]: The woman in question apparently got fed up with her unemployed fiancé for spending more time online than looking for a job so he could pay for the wedding.

596
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:13,068
[SPEAKER_07]: So on August 6th, allegedly, she did the deed.

597
00:38:19,728 --> 00:38:22,511
[SPEAKER_01]: and he wasn't getting off his ass looking for a job.

598
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:24,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we did spend a year like that.

599
00:38:24,933 --> 00:38:29,096
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, we had the money in the bank to afford it.

600
00:38:29,277 --> 00:38:30,558
[SPEAKER_01]: We could afford for him to not work.

601
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:38,725
[SPEAKER_01]: However, had that money not been there and I was having to support him or he was just sitting on his ass, I'd have left him.

602
00:38:39,466 --> 00:38:39,986
[SPEAKER_01]: Shit yeah.

603
00:38:40,527 --> 00:38:43,469
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because I have a brain in my head and I use it.

604
00:38:43,609 --> 00:38:44,770
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, it's just interesting.

605
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,652
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead of dumping his ass, she shot him.

606
00:38:47,105 --> 00:38:47,886
[SPEAKER_07]: or whatever she did.

607
00:38:48,266 --> 00:38:49,127
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't say.

608
00:38:49,167 --> 00:38:49,748
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to know.

609
00:38:50,248 --> 00:38:57,676
[SPEAKER_01]: Either way, you're without him, you know, and now you've got to deal with finding a date when you get out of the prison, I guess.

610
00:38:57,756 --> 00:38:59,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Only they were playing more of the hot coffee mod.

611
00:38:59,758 --> 00:39:02,040
[SPEAKER_06]: They would have learned that they can solve their problems by having... Stop.

612
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:04,022
[SPEAKER_01]: We said no more hot coffee.

613
00:39:04,123 --> 00:39:04,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop right now.

614
00:39:05,144 --> 00:39:08,807
[SPEAKER_01]: Hot coffee talk is banned from the podcast.

615
00:39:08,948 --> 00:39:09,368
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

616
00:39:11,926 --> 00:39:12,446
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

617
00:39:13,246 --> 00:39:14,767
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make a game called Hot Coffee.

618
00:39:14,787 --> 00:39:18,228
[SPEAKER_07]: More than ever, we need some of DarkSakura's advice column.

619
00:39:18,248 --> 00:39:24,910
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if we stayed inside and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to get murdered by our fiancés.

620
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:29,011
[SPEAKER_07]: So DarkSakura has her advice column for us.

621
00:39:29,191 --> 00:39:31,412
[SPEAKER_07]: And DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling us about tonight?

622
00:39:31,672 --> 00:39:36,514
[SPEAKER_01]: Today's bit of advice is how to drown your co-host in hot coffee.

623
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:37,434
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, wait.

624
00:39:38,114 --> 00:39:40,895
[SPEAKER_01]: How to escape from a car hanging over the edge of a cliff.

625
00:39:42,943 --> 00:39:45,724
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.

626
00:39:43,343 --> 00:39:45,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not shift your weight or make any sudden movements.

627
00:39:46,805 --> 00:39:45,724
2.

628
00:39:47,365 --> 00:39:52,089
[SPEAKER_01]: If the front doors are still over land, use these doors to make your escape regardless of which way your car is facing.

629
00:39:52,109 --> 00:39:52,089
3.

630
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:00,154
[SPEAKER_01]: If the front doors are over the edge, proceed slowly to the rear of the car.

631
00:40:01,655 --> 00:40:00,154
4.

632
00:40:01,795 --> 00:40:03,956
[SPEAKER_01]: Reassess your situation and make your escape.

633
00:40:04,337 --> 00:40:06,458
[SPEAKER_01]: Will opening the rear doors cause the car to slide?

634
00:40:06,952 --> 00:40:08,552
[SPEAKER_01]: If not, open them slowly and get out.

635
00:40:09,072 --> 00:40:14,433
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, use a steering wheel lock or screwdriver to break the window and climb out as quickly as possible.

636
00:40:14,993 --> 00:40:16,594
[SPEAKER_01]: But my final piece of advice?

637
00:40:16,694 --> 00:40:16,954
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

638
00:40:18,554 --> 00:40:19,654
[SPEAKER_01]: I have two, actually.

639
00:40:20,434 --> 00:40:29,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Either don't pull a Thelma and Louise or make sure that you have one of those drag strip parachutes attached to the back of your car so at least when you land, it'll be softer.

640
00:40:30,616 --> 00:40:30,956
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

641
00:40:31,356 --> 00:40:32,597
[SPEAKER_07]: Or how about don't drive off cliffs?

642
00:40:32,757 --> 00:40:33,517
[SPEAKER_07]: That would be my advice.

643
00:40:34,057 --> 00:40:34,797
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't drive off cliffs.

644
00:40:35,854 --> 00:40:37,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't drive anywhere but in Colorado.

645
00:40:39,317 --> 00:40:39,617
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

646
00:40:40,057 --> 00:40:40,478
[SPEAKER_01]: Flatland.

647
00:40:41,098 --> 00:40:42,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't talk on your cell phone while driving.

648
00:40:44,321 --> 00:40:45,622
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado has the Rockies.

649
00:40:46,563 --> 00:40:47,783
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about the flat part.

650
00:40:47,924 --> 00:40:50,065
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to drive your car up a mountain.

651
00:40:50,926 --> 00:40:51,286
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway.

652
00:40:52,747 --> 00:40:53,808
[SPEAKER_07]: There's cliffs on a mountain.

653
00:40:53,848 --> 00:40:54,169
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

654
00:40:54,789 --> 00:40:55,149
[SPEAKER_07]: Forget it.

655
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,392
[SPEAKER_01]: The only cliffs I care about are Cliff Notes.

656
00:40:58,860 --> 00:41:02,723
[SPEAKER_07]: Nintendo is going to be moving into the mobile phone market.

657
00:41:02,843 --> 00:41:04,144
[SPEAKER_07]: No games just yet.

658
00:41:04,224 --> 00:41:06,666
[SPEAKER_07]: No cell phone Mario, no cell phone Zelda.

659
00:41:07,066 --> 00:41:19,175
[SPEAKER_07]: However, on October 17th, Nintendo Mobile will be providing subscribers with video game related content such as wallpapers, ringtones, and sound effects from the Super Mario Bros.

660
00:41:19,195 --> 00:41:19,555
[SPEAKER_07]: series.

661
00:41:19,915 --> 00:41:22,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, one thing I should note, this is in Japan only.

662
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:23,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Durr.

663
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:24,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I told you that.

664
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:27,761
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but they actually are going to be porting over the classic games from what I hear.

665
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,634
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

666
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,331
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple puzzle games are okay.

667
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:42,092
[SPEAKER_00]: I liked that Before Crisis game.

668
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:42,712
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty fun.

669
00:41:43,352 --> 00:41:46,473
[SPEAKER_00]: The Final Fantasy Before Crisis.

670
00:41:47,154 --> 00:41:49,014
[SPEAKER_07]: I think even Before Crisis is going to suck.

671
00:41:49,034 --> 00:41:52,075
[SPEAKER_06]: It would only be good if they re-released it to the PSP.

672
00:41:52,355 --> 00:41:57,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Cell phone is not the place to be gaming because at least on my phone most of the games are Java based and it's slow.

673
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:03,099
[SPEAKER_07]: A puzzle game works okay but not a fast paced puzzle game like Tetris even sucks.

674
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,720
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen better games on a freaking

675
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:15,782
[SPEAKER_07]: Graphing Calculator I've seen better games on the Apple 2E Loadrunner, Kicks Oregon Trail, yo Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world?

676
00:42:16,142 --> 00:42:34,365
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the group We Are Back is still teasing the fact that they're going to be releasing a downgrader and this will downgrade everything from 2.0 on to back to 1 and that's going to be it right there Homebrew is going to be loud for everybody and yeah

677
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:37,317
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyways, so that's what's going on there.

678
00:42:37,417 --> 00:42:41,540
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also having some homebrew contests for PSP games, which is kind of interesting.

679
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:47,385
[SPEAKER_06]: So they have some entries for that that are actually, they're kind of plugging on PSP updates.

680
00:42:47,505 --> 00:42:49,127
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them look pretty interesting.

681
00:42:49,887 --> 00:43:01,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a program was released the other day actually that you can change the little intro video on, you know, have the little small clip that plays when you turn on your PSP or play a game or whatever.

682
00:43:02,418 --> 00:43:02,998
[SPEAKER_06]: You can change that.

683
00:43:03,218 --> 00:43:06,841
[SPEAKER_06]: And they have a demonstration on there on how to do that as well.

684
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:08,682
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can customize your PSP a little bit more.

685
00:43:09,742 --> 00:43:16,646
[SPEAKER_06]: And other than that, really not too much else going on with the PSP.

686
00:43:17,387 --> 00:43:21,369
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I should also say... Oh, one more thing I almost forgot.

687
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:26,852
[SPEAKER_06]: They're actually releasing another emulator, of course, coming out.

688
00:43:27,433 --> 00:43:31,655
[SPEAKER_06]: And that one was for... Oh, what was it?

689
00:43:32,932 --> 00:43:33,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't remember.

690
00:43:33,372 --> 00:43:35,254
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, enough of that.

691
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

692
00:43:37,055 --> 00:43:39,837
[SPEAKER_06]: Other than that, lots of homebrew stuff coming out for the DS.

693
00:43:40,197 --> 00:43:42,459
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, the DS isn't to be forgotten.

694
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:44,320
[SPEAKER_06]: And, yeah.

695
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,222
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll just have to wait for the downgrader.

696
00:43:46,342 --> 00:43:48,864
[SPEAKER_06]: They're still saying a couple more weeks.

697
00:43:50,165 --> 00:43:51,566
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the shit will hit the fan.

698
00:43:52,586 --> 00:43:52,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

699
00:43:53,807 --> 00:43:54,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

700
00:43:55,669 --> 00:43:56,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Moving on.

701
00:43:56,169 --> 00:43:58,651
[SPEAKER_07]: A couple last stories here for tonight's.

702
00:43:59,348 --> 00:44:25,648
[SPEAKER_07]: Civilization 4 is going to be doing a little pre-order program A special limited edition collector's package, which has collector's packaging A CD soundtrack of the game, a keyboard template, a tech map, and a spiral-bound version of the manual So that's just a special pre-order edition Civilization 4, of course, coming out this October I'm interested in it I love, love, love, love, love, love, love the original Civilization game

703
00:44:26,289 --> 00:44:27,670
[SPEAKER_07]: Never really got into Civ 2 or 3.

704
00:44:28,110 --> 00:44:28,431
[SPEAKER_07]: Why?

705
00:44:28,691 --> 00:44:29,091
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

706
00:44:29,131 --> 00:44:32,053
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they just got too complex for me at that point or something.

707
00:44:32,754 --> 00:44:33,054
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

708
00:44:33,094 --> 00:44:34,035
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked it simple.

709
00:44:34,916 --> 00:44:38,939
[SPEAKER_07]: Simple graphics, simple mechanics to the game and everything.

710
00:44:38,999 --> 00:44:40,380
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first one's my favorite.

711
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:43,542
[SPEAKER_07]: But I am very curious about 4 and I'll definitely give it a try.

712
00:44:43,602 --> 00:44:47,085
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm certainly wanting to see what they've done with the series since 3.

713
00:44:49,586 --> 00:44:55,611
[SPEAKER_07]: Mega Man is going to be making an appearance at the Tokyo Game Show in Capcom's booth.

714
00:44:56,192 --> 00:45:01,413
[SPEAKER_07]: The interesting thing is that the game is called Rockman Rockman, which would be Mega Man Mega Man.

715
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:03,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Which game now?

716
00:45:03,754 --> 00:45:05,434
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called Rockman Rockman.

717
00:45:05,594 --> 00:45:07,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's a remake of the first Mega Man.

718
00:45:07,514 --> 00:45:08,555
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was going to get to that.

719
00:45:08,855 --> 00:45:10,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.

720
00:45:10,455 --> 00:45:16,336
[SPEAKER_07]: It happens to be it's going to be a remake of the original Mega Man game is the rumor about what it's going to be.

721
00:45:17,196 --> 00:45:21,177
[SPEAKER_07]: But we don't know exactly what system it's going to be on, but they're saying PSP.

722
00:45:21,357 --> 00:45:22,077
[SPEAKER_07]: It is PSP.

723
00:45:22,317 --> 00:45:25,118
[SPEAKER_06]: And they actually have the site has launched for it.

724
00:45:25,863 --> 00:45:26,683
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't know that part.

725
00:45:26,883 --> 00:45:29,124
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, the site has launched for it.

726
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:32,486
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can pull it up here to see what the site was.

727
00:45:34,266 --> 00:45:35,347
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks really interesting.

728
00:45:35,407 --> 00:45:39,228
[SPEAKER_06]: Mega Man's very, it's very cartoony, unlike the original Mega Man.

729
00:45:39,508 --> 00:45:46,251
[SPEAKER_06]: His head is ginormous, which I don't know why they did it that way, but it's interesting.

730
00:45:46,731 --> 00:45:50,313
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually make your own levels on it, which is pretty cool.

731
00:45:52,591 --> 00:45:53,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you can make your own levels?

732
00:45:54,012 --> 00:45:55,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it has a level editor built into it.

733
00:45:55,774 --> 00:45:56,474
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.

734
00:45:57,195 --> 00:45:57,916
[SPEAKER_06]: That's very cool.

735
00:45:58,216 --> 00:45:59,417
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out for the PSP.

736
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:06,923
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't remember the website, but I'll find it out while we're talking and I'll let you guys know.

737
00:46:07,083 --> 00:46:07,984
[SPEAKER_07]: We're almost at the end of the show.

738
00:46:08,004 --> 00:46:08,805
[SPEAKER_07]: I only got one more story.

739
00:46:08,885 --> 00:46:09,445
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll be hurry.

740
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:09,846
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll hurry.

741
00:46:10,046 --> 00:46:10,286
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

742
00:46:11,006 --> 00:46:11,867
[SPEAKER_07]: Last story here.

743
00:46:12,268 --> 00:46:15,430
[SPEAKER_07]: We always seem to talk about these video games that are being turned into movies.

744
00:46:16,491 --> 00:46:19,634
[SPEAKER_07]: MTV, hooray, hooray, bought the film rights.

745
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:21,095
[SPEAKER_07]: I said that with a little bit of sarcasm, by the way.

746
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:25,014
[SPEAKER_07]: Midway's The Suffering Executive Vice President of MTV Films David Gale

747
00:46:44,827 --> 00:46:51,129
[SPEAKER_07]: It makes perfect sense for us to work with Midway, Stan Winston, and Circle of Confusion on bringing the suffering to life as a feature film.

748
00:46:51,529 --> 00:46:59,212
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that's why I think it's interesting that it says gaming is such a huge part of the culture for MTV's audience when I can't think of many gaming shows that MTV has aired.

749
00:46:59,772 --> 00:47:06,034
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe a special here and there, and a category on their video music awards, but not really a huge part of the network.

750
00:47:06,494 --> 00:47:08,195
[SPEAKER_07]: Then again, music videos aren't a huge part of the network either.

751
00:47:08,215 --> 00:47:09,715
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they're referring to their audience themselves.

752
00:47:09,855 --> 00:47:10,315
[SPEAKER_07]: I suppose.

753
00:47:10,596 --> 00:47:10,776
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

754
00:47:11,716 --> 00:47:11,976
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyway.

755
00:47:13,186 --> 00:47:18,647
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess we'll see when we get some stars and directors attached, but all we know for now is that MTV is producing them.

756
00:47:18,667 --> 00:47:19,807
[SPEAKER_07]: That's not necessarily a bad thing.

757
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:23,088
[SPEAKER_07]: MTV, even though I'm knocking on them a little bit, they've actually put out some pretty good films.

758
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:26,509
[SPEAKER_07]: Election, from a couple years ago, is one of my favorite movies.

759
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:27,029
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

760
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:29,510
[SPEAKER_07]: And MTV was actually behind that, so go figure.

761
00:47:29,590 --> 00:47:33,310
[SPEAKER_06]: And one that I like that's coming out pretty soon was Roll Balance.

762
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:34,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks interesting.

763
00:47:34,731 --> 00:47:36,331
[SPEAKER_07]: Weren't they behind Napoleon Dynamite, too?

764
00:47:36,911 --> 00:47:37,571
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to say yes.

765
00:47:37,731 --> 00:47:38,151
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

766
00:47:39,592 --> 00:47:40,592
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though that movie kind of...

767
00:47:41,314 --> 00:47:41,995
[SPEAKER_07]: You're welcome.

768
00:47:42,015 --> 00:47:43,376
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought?

769
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:10,991
[SPEAKER_07]: Happy birthday to me.

770
00:48:11,091 --> 00:48:12,311
[SPEAKER_07]: That's right, happy birthday to you.

771
00:48:13,532 --> 00:48:17,473
[SPEAKER_07]: And for your birthday, I had Final Fantasy VII Advent Children leaked to the internet.

772
00:48:17,533 --> 00:48:19,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that.

773
00:48:19,754 --> 00:48:20,154
[SPEAKER_06]: There you go.

774
00:48:21,615 --> 00:48:26,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright, have a good night, or day, or afternoon, whenever you happen to be listening to this, everybody.

775
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:27,757
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good time.

776
00:48:28,017 --> 00:48:28,678
[SPEAKER_07]: Just have a good one.

777
00:48:28,798 --> 00:48:31,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good time, have a gay old time.

778
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,380
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki wants you to have a gay old time.

779
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:37,021
[SPEAKER_07]: And on that note, goodbye.

780
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:42,190
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

781
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:48,039
[SPEAKER_05]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

782
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,502
[SPEAKER_05]: See you next update.
