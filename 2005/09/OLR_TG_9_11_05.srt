only tech master Loki I'm here how you doing I'm good good all right usually

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,160
We like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week? What do you been playing?

15
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,820
Let's get right into it dark soccer. What do you been playing this week puppies?

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,800
Everybody puppies have you been good about it you actually going in there every day

17
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,560
Yeah, and I walk my puppies and clean up their poopy and I make them eat catch frisbee and earn me money

18
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,040
So I pimp out my puppies to the frisbee people

19
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,440
Do you think the game is starting to get to the point of it's getting a little irritating having to go in every day?

20
00:01:21,440 --> 00:01:25,560
No, no, cuz that's what some people are bitching about. I'm hearing well

21
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,440
And they you know never had a virtual pet before and ten dogs was not for them

22
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,440
They never carried around their pocket Pikachu damn it I

23
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:38,940
Also, but I went to Dave and Busters last night and played battle tech for the first time mm-hmm

24
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:45,080
Yeah, they gave me a headache made me want to throw up now describe battle tech for those who may not know you get in

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:49,000
these pod things and basically it's like you're in the cockpit of a mech and

26
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
You go around killing people

27
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:56,860
I didn't like it maybe because they it's one of those games where the screens up

28
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:02,260
on top and it reflects onto a concave mirror oh it's weird and it just oh it

29
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:10,700
totally messes my sense of motion sickness I played one in the midnight

30
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:15,540
maximum tune last night and completely owned my husband so weird saying that

31
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,940
your husband ten days and I still have trouble writing my last name I haven't

32
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:31,660
into the DMV yet either. I also played a bunch of ticket games and that was really...

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,640
State Busters is the one place where playing ticket games can be cool, not like Chuck E.

34
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,780
Cheese. Yeah, I was trying to save up enough to get new mugs but they didn't have any mugs

35
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:42,980
so I just saved my tickets. I had enough to purchase an Xbox game or a PS2 game but I

36
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:48,100
just, I didn't. They were cool. I thought about getting that racing game that Rockstar

37
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,780
puts out the Midnight Debeditions? I can never remember. Midnight Club 3 Debeditions. If

38
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:57,380
you want to play that, I've got it, I think. Eh, maybe I'll borrow it and check it out.

39
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:02,380
I need a good racing game. Now that I've given you back your copy of Silent Hill 4. Awesome.

40
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:09,380
I need to play through that. Anyway, anything else? Puppies! Alright, Loki. So, I've been

41
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:17,460
playing Burnout 3, as per usual, and then I got a copy of Burnout Legends for the PSP,

42
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:21,840
So I've been playing that just to tide me over until I get burnout revenge this week

43
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:27,800
Which I have on pre-order and already paid for and that one's gonna be awesome and burnout legends is cool

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,960
It's kind of all three games of the original three put together plus, you know

45
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,040
bonus stuff and

46
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,240
I love it. I love you haven't shut up about this burnout game for like two months and then

47
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:44,080
Then other things I've been playing Nintendogs. Of course. I have to take care of taco

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:49,720
which I do find it a little annoying just because he's always hungry no

49
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:55,200
matter how often I check it's like damn my dog never got that hungry I mean why

50
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,680
can't you just leave the bowl out for him to eat the damn food and just leave

51
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,320
it there I mean my dog never went through a bowl of water that quick I

52
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,720
mean what the hell the water should be free why the hell that the buy water

53
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:10,600
because your puppies need special water oh fuck by the dog store you have to

54
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,280
special water you have to walk to the discount store and get it for you know

55
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,400
uber cheap I want to why isn't there a store where you have to buy toys you have

56
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,360
to find used toys in the street I mean is that a little weird that's all that

57
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,520
crap um my friend got a Dalmatian that's cool yeah I heard Dalmatians were

58
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,200
unlockable in it but found the fireman hat lucky got a Dalmatian just in the

59
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:38,680
street somewhere Lana um she found you have to if you walk around the top

60
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:44,000
perimeter uh-huh then you get more rare stuff oh interesting the further away

61
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,720
you go from home the better stuff you know what the hell are those packages

62
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,520
that I'll be walking also there's a box sitting on the ground you have to shake

63
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,240
your leash over it pull your dog back and he'll grab it and open it use the

64
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,480
leash to pull back I was shaking the hell out of my dog you thought that was

65
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,600
like trying to kill it or something the fucker wouldn't pick up the package I've

66
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,260
got two dogs I have I'm as well Welsh Corgi and I have Menchie who's a she but

67
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:12,700
You know, I didn't realize I have anime dogs now, both of them, and they're both like fish sticks from the trash can.

68
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:17,140
I have Oscar, my wiener dog, who has a Mario hat now, by the way, which I found in the street.

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:24,780
I have Taco, who has a spike collar and news hat and some sunglasses.

70
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:28,620
So I stuck with the spike collar because that was the least gay of all of them.

71
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:31,020
I have the Japanese style collar on Menchie.

72
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,980
I don't know, but anyways, other things I've been playing. I've been playing this game.

73
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:42,620
I tried it out today. It was a dream TV. I want to say it's like dream mix TV

74
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,540
World fighters and it's like all these different characters from Konami games Hudson's

75
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,460
Hudson games and

76
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,580
And Takara games and it's like you can do fights against it's basically like Super Smash Brothers

77
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,540
But you can play as like Simon Belmont versus

78
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:05,540
Octomus Prime! I mean, come on, that's crazy. That's rad, and Octomus Prime turns into a truck and runs over people.

79
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:10,540
I find it funny, well, Takara is actually, Takara is a toy maker.

80
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:16,540
And they're the ones who put out Transformers and like, Leekachan, the little Barbie doll in Japan.

81
00:06:16,540 --> 00:06:19,540
Yep, she's in it. Yeah, Leekachan's in it.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:24,540
And then Master Higgins from Adventure Island. I hear Bonk is unlockable, so it's pretty cool.

83
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:27,540
cool. It's great. But it's not a new game, it's been out a little while. It's been out

84
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,900
for a couple of years but it's just really weird and I was like, I got it. Sometimes

85
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,940
we discover these little import gems a little late, so. I know, and hey, well you know we're

86
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:42,740
not in Japan so we can't do this stuff advertised right away so hey, whatever, it's still good.

87
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:47,740
And then of course I'm putting more money down on my 360 so waiting for that. So, lots

88
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:52,780
of stuff. Sounds good. On Gamestop's site they have a thousand dollar like ultimate

89
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:56,460
bundle. I think we talked about that the week you were here. Yeah, it was crazy.

90
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,960
We were talking to the game publishers about that and they were laughing at how

91
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,300
ridiculous and stupid it is, because most of those games

92
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,420
aren't coming out at launch. I don't know how they're going to get this stuff,

93
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,620
but it's not coming out

94
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:11,000
at launch. Ooh, ouch. I want to think about that before you pre-order. The games get

95
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:16,260
delayed all the time. Who is going to pay thousands of dollars for every game?

96
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,420
Just buy them as they come out! Oh my god, I'm not interested in that one.

97
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:25,540
Like I said, rich people. Rich people don't care. Paris Hilton. She doesn't care. She

98
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:28,940
just wants her Xbox. I don't even know how to freaking use an Xbox. Anyway.

99
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:34,900
She can make sausage. Moving on, my gaming week. I played mostly

100
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:39,620
games that are kind of old. Speaking of rediscovering old games, I bought.hack a couple weeks ago

101
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:43,800
and I've finally been getting into it this week and just playing through it. It's really

102
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:50,380
a cool little game. I like the story. I like the idea of an MMO, but it's not. Like, it's

103
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:52,240
I don't know it's kind of neat

104
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,000
So the idea is if I'm dedicated enough, I'll play through all four parts at some point

105
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,360
But let's get through part one first and see how much love I still have for it at the end of that

106
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,320
Then what else?

107
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:09,840
For my birthday a late birthday present, but that's alright. I like presents no matter what time of year

108
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,320
It is I got Super Smash Brothers melee from Dark Sakura for the Gamecube

109
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:20,160
Which is really I don't know why I never picked up this game before I think because like all my friends have it

110
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,540
So I played it to death really but I was kind of sitting there cuz it's been like six months

111
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,580
Since I played it. I was really sitting down with it today and going gosh

112
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,740
This is seriously one of the greatest GameCube games they put out

113
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,540
Yeah, I not just as one of the greatest next-gen games they put out period there

114
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:39,380
It's just it's such a great game because there's so much to do in it

115
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:45,260
You need to get all the little pieces and there's out the characters trophies. There's the

116
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,240
Single-player mode where you do the adventure. There's

117
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,400
There's the mini games, the little challenges, hit the targets, there's so many cool little

118
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:58,920
things that just keep this game going and that's just, oh man, I just love the game.

119
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,440
And I was also rediscovering F-Zero today, oh yeah, I was trying to, because I was hooking

120
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:07,080
up the GameCube again and I wanted to try out some of these games to support widescreen

121
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,080
TV.

122
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:13,440
And I'm kind of upset though because Nintendo does not support component cable anymore.

123
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,600
So if I want to hook up to my HDTV I have to use S-video.

124
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:23,160
S video on the HDTV makes things look blurry compared to the Playstation 2. F0 looked blurry!

125
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,760
And that's kind of upsetting because F0 is a really sharp looking game. It's an awesome

126
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:31,080
looking game. I went to Nintendo's website to try and find a component cable. They stopped

127
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:35,520
making them. Third party. And did you... I can't even find a third party cable at Fry's

128
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,720
or anything. Actually I think that Licksync carries them. Maybe that's where I'm gonna

129
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,360
have to go. But here's the other weird thing. Okay, since mid-2004, Nintendo stopped putting

130
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,720
the digital output port on the back of the Gamecubes.

131
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,880
If you didn't buy your Gamecube before,

132
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,480
probably when the 79 price drop or whatever it's at now,

133
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
your Gamecube doesn't have this port

134
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,900
and you'll never have the component.

135
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:00,360
It really irks me about Nintendo's lack of next definition,

136
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,780
or next definition, next generation television support.

137
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,240
If they're gonna go up to the next level

138
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,080
with next gen gaming and we all heard that story

139
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:07,920
a while back where they're saying

140
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,800
Revolution's not gonna support HDTV,

141
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,440
that really bothers me because,

142
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,080
you know, after launch, a couple years after launch,

143
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,400
a lot more people are going to be buying these HDTVs and they will be

144
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:23,000
a bigger market share and Nintendo's going to be left out cold. Especially since,

145
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,600
you know, I've got these pictures up of the PS3 that I took at E3

146
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,320
with the two HDMI ports on the back. Oh, very sexy.

147
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,340
Yeah, in case you have two

148
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,120
HDTVs sitting next to each other.

149
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:42,480
Like every like I I know I have five of them sitting next to each other so that'll be no problem

150
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:48,980
That makes me think they'll remember the i-link. Mm-hmm, and that probably could be for dual output for multiplayer games

151
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,460
Very possible very possible. So anyway, I still love you Nintendo, but come on get with the times

152
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,200
It's time to start supporting HD a little better and I hope they change their mind on the revolution and and remake the component cables

153
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:06,000
So while they're at it, they should drop the price on those plasma TVs because they're too fucking expensive

154
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,780
You know, but I got mine at Costco, and it's not that it's not a it's not a plasma, but it's a

155
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,460
HD here's a regular

156
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,700
Costco doesn't advertise. Hmm, which is a very good advantage of buying things from there

157
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:22,100
No matter how long you have owned something if anything on it goes wrong

158
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,740
You can take it back and they have to take it back for a full refund or replacement. So

159
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
Not even if it's ten years

160
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:32,500
Yep

161
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,820
So we're gamers just like you guys out there listening

162
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,460
So we're just telling you guys where to get the good deal because that's what I I

163
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:44,540
Felt and I shopped around for HDTV and I seriously felt Costco was the best deal. We like quality for our gaming goodness

164
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:52,760
Let's talk about some news tonight going into next gen. Let's talk about the next generation Sonic

165
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,060
They teased it a little bit at e3

166
00:11:55,060 --> 00:12:01,540
But now they are officially announcing that they are going to be making a next gen Sonic the Hedgehog games Sega, of course

167
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:08,540
It's part of their Tokyo Game Show lineup, and Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be coming out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

168
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:13,540
No word yet about a Revolution release, but nobody's really talking about the Revolution yet.

169
00:12:13,540 --> 00:12:15,540
I imagine they will early next year.

170
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:21,540
By the way, Sega's also going to be showing them at Tokyo Game Show a mech game called ChromeHounds for the 360.

171
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,540
Which looks sexy.

172
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:29,540
And a Sonic Riders game for Xbox, PS2, and GameCube.

173
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,500
cube chromehounds looks sexy I've seen the pictures of what is this I haven't

174
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:37,840

180
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,380
Looking this up right now.

181
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,380
Oh, there it is.

182
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,380
Yeah.

183
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:16,980
They have screenshots and I'm going to pull one up here in the studio.

184
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:25,200
Basically they're linking from gamespress.com, a press site.

185
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,080
it looks it looks sexy looks pretty hot

186
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:30,880
it should be interesting okay a follow-up to something else complain about

187
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,840
earlier dark soccer you were researching and what you find you find

188
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:37,760
licksang.com about thirty four dollars ninety cents they have GameCube

189
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,000
component cables

190
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,600
$34.90 man that's expensive for a cable

191
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:45,960
might be worth it check if you have digital AV output port

192
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:50,240
yep because we have a new GameCube you don't have it

193
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,120
anyway I'm looking for the next-gen Sonic that little video that you were

194
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,720
showing before the podcast look you look very sexy so I didn't get a chance to go

195
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,340
to the Sega theater at this year's e3 because it was another one of those

196
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:03,180
things that had a line oh no actually the line for the Sega theater yeah I

197
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,660
spent less than 10 minutes in it yeah I when I was looking I was looking to go

198
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,760
in the last day and it just was wrapping around the thing and I just I was I was

199
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,400
around the other side of it less than 10 minute wait seriously

200
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:18,680
darn you and if you were waiting in line they came by and gave you t-shirts or

201
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:23,320
plushies but I lost out maybe I'll do it they had this nice home theater

207
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:53,000
permission to go to E3! Yay! Alright! Congratulations. Actually, about Sega, one other thing, just

208
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:58,500
a little thing, is that, you know, the Sega Ages re-releases? Mm-hmm. The Sega Age 2500?

209
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:02,860
Gunstar Heroes is being re-released. Cool. Sega Ages. I'm gonna try, actually, I've got

210
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,220
two of them I've got to try out right now. I can't remember what, I remember one of them

211
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:11,540
was Virtua Racing, the Sega Ages for that, I've tried that, and I can't remember what

212
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,740
the other one is for the life of me, but it was another really good game. I've got Fantasy

213
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:17,740
Star, Space Harrier, and Fantasy Zone.

214
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,740
I want to check out Fantasy Star. I bet that's cool.

215
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,740
I'll bring it over. We've got to save about halfway through it.

216
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,740
But yeah, it looks really nice.

217
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Nice. Moving on, of course, two very, very highly talked about games this year when it comes to handhelds

218
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,740
are the two puzzlers, Luminous and Meteos.

219
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:38,740
And, of course, very similar because they are developed by the same guy.

220
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,740
Luminous and Meteos are actually going to be re-released on one handheld system.

221
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,020
So they'll both be available on one handheld system finally. That handheld

222
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,580
system?

223
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:53,900
A Neo Geo Pocket Color. No. A cellular telephone will be the handheld system.

224
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:58,300
In other words, wah wah wah. In other words, forget it because cell phone game

225
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:58,960
ports

226
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:03,220
suck. It's cute for the nostalgia value for about five minutes

227
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,460
but for the most part, at least here in America, are cell phones. The

228
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:10,740
cell phone games suck. And the single N-Gage owner out there rejoices.

229
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,180
No, it's not coming out for Engage. It's a cell phone.

230
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,940
They play mobile phone games, though.

231
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:21,860
Snake for life. Snake was the only good cell phone game.

232
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,540
First quarter 2006 when Q Entertainment will be...

233
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,900
I'm sorry, not Q Entertainment, Gameloft signed the agreement with Q Entertainment

234
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,880
to put these out first quarter 2006. You guys remember, this was something we had

235
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,960
talked about when our podcast first started, I think it was like back in January.

236
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:45,640
Playboy magazine did a spread featuring the girls of gaming or they had topless blood rain and Melina

237
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,460
Guess what in October? They're doing it again. I'm gonna buy that issue just for the show

238
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:57,140
Who is the sacrifice who is yeah, I owe the sacrifices you have to make

239
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,760
Who are the characters you will be seeing in?

240
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:06,320
October's Playboy in the buff the digital buff or whatever one call I feel so stupid talking about this seriously

241
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:12,700
this is I can't believe it was I can't believe that it was so popular the first

242
00:17:12,700 --> 00:17:16,580
time they're doing it again I I honestly feel sorry they're gonna have the hot

243
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:21,020
coffee mod uncensored on this I I have no idea but here's some of the games

244
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:25,200
Jackie who is a cheerleader in Midway's blitz the league

245
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:31,420
Carla Valenti from Atari's indigo prophecy Capcom's dark watch will have

246
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:35,140
Cassidy and Tala who was a vampire

247
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:37,760
female I might add that Cassidy was

248
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,820
killed off in about the first five

249
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,640
minutes of the game her head ripped

250
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,040
clean from her body thank you for

251
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,480
sharing a bit of irony to that last

252
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,920
issue made it on CNN money really whoa

253
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:54,320
oh my gosh they actually have an article

254
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,240
there is on CNN money yeah hey whatever

255
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,000
make some money huh and of course of

256
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Of course, um, Playboy, uh, Playboy Mansion Private Party will have a couple of their models in the spread.

257
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:12,000
But, um, Namco doesn't want to be left out. They'll have a character from Hellgate London, and of course, Sony's God of War getting in on it as well.

258
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
And what's funny, everybody's joke about this is they're all,

259
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
What the hell is Hellgate London?

260
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,000
They're all, we don't even know what that game is.

261
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,000
I've actually never heard of this myself, and I'm kind of reading this going,

262
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Okay, must be some game I just haven't heard of. I can't play them all.

263
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Anyway.

264
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,840
What was the original spread called before?

265
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,000
I don't know.

266
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,960
Digital, I just closed the story.

267
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,800
I don't care.

268
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,520
Don't do any more research on this.

269
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,620
It lowers your IQ.

270
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,240
This is a very interesting story

271
00:18:41,240 --> 00:18:43,840
I think we ought to talk about here.

272
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,480
Because this affects us here in California.

273
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,520
Of course, Orange Lounge Radio,

274
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:49,280
we're based out of Sacramento, California.

275
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,520
But we do have a worldwide audience.

276
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,400
But this is something that's going on in California.

277
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,280
And California's kind of been known to set the tone

278
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,480
for the rest of the nation sometimes

279
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,120
when it comes to certain bills.

280
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,200
Assembly Bill 1179.

281
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,880
This is the bill that Assemblyman Leland Yee

282
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,520
was kind of behind a couple months ago

283
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,720
when the hot coffee thing was really big.

284
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:13,280
It prohibits retailers from selling violent games to minors

285
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,040
or else they'll be fined $1,000 for each violation.

286
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:20,840
It passed in the California Senate by a vote of 22 to nine

287
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:23,640
and it passed in the Assembly 65 to seven.

288
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:27,440
So it's now sitting on Governor Schwarzenegger's,

289
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,520
and speaking of feeling like an idiot saying something,

290
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,280
Governor Schwarzenegger's desk right now

291
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,320
waiting to be signed.

292
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:36,940
He must sign or veto the bill by October 9th.

293
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:40,680
So no word yet on which way he'll go,

294
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,920
but probably considering the fairly overwhelming support,

295
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,800
he will probably sign this bill,

296
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:50,440
and it would go into effect January 1st, 2006.

297
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,680
By the way, the bill will also require

298
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:59,720
the games be labeled as being for sale to adults only by a solid 18-sticker no smaller

299
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:04,040
than 2 inches by 2 inches on the front of the package.

300
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:07,160
So that's very interesting because if you think about it, a Game Boy Advance game is

301
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:11,200
only 5 inches by 5 inches of the packaging, so a little 18-sticker would take up like

302
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,620
half the box.

303
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:20,280
The bill also makes no mention of the current ESRB system, so the bill defines its own means

304
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:24,280
of a violent video game saying a video game in which the range of options

305
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,920
available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually

306
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:34,820
assaulting an image of a human being. Wow, that goes for all of them. They're very

307
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:40,880
very interesting. Bye bye, like all fighting games, you know, it's retarded. Very

308
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:46,480
interesting. It'll be interesting to see what happens with this bill. So we'll see

309
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,120
come the new year because we're expecting that Governor Schwarzenegger is

310
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:58,360
going to sign it. Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks is going gold. This was a game that I played

311
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:03,360
a little bit at E3 and I actually kind of enjoyed it. Didn't think I would, but it's

312
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:07,900
actually kind of cool. It's a neat little, it's not like a typical Mortal Kombat game

313
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:13,180
because it's more of like a 3D adventure type thing, or I shouldn't say 3D, but a 3D ISO

314
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,940
perspective type game, where you're just going around killing things, which will probably

315
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:25,940
be one of the first games to carry an 18 sticker, by the way. And that game has recently gone

316
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:31,600
gold, and it'll be coming out for $49.99 on September 19th. That's next week.

317
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,600
Our UK listeners get it on the 23rd. Very cool.

318
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:38,600
It's not next week. It'll be a week after Monday.

319
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:43,720
Oh, okay. Ha! Anyway, and the shows go out on Monday, remember?

320
00:21:43,720 --> 00:21:45,720
That's right. This is a Monday show, remember?

321
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:50,520

326
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:23,120
good stuff. Actually, uh, Advanced Wars DS comes out on the 30th there too, as well as

327
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:27,120
Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow on the 29th. Advanced Wars DS is one of those games I got to pick

328
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,160
up. I've been hearing a lot, a lot of good things about it, so I wanted to check it out.

329
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:34,560
If you've got the other two, um, it has a tie-in on there. Actually, you get more options

330
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:38,580
in the shop. Oh, like if you put the Advanced game in the bottom slot? Yep. Very cool! I'm

331
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:43,620
liking this DS interacting with the other ports good another game is

332
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:49,260
checking out a yahoo uk and ireland games is a Winx Club Konami is putting

333
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:56,580
out a Winx Club game oh hooray it's so cute I guess I don't know and then

334
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:01,860
lastly a date for Animal Crossing DS which is going to be renamed wild world

335
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:09,100
for a release says first quarter 2006. Wait, so the whole game itself is gonna be called

336
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:15,700
Wild World in Europe? I think it's a subtitle. So it's Animal Crossing Wild World instead

337
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:23,060
of Animal Crossing DS officially? However, you know, of course we're getting it in December.

338
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,300
Which is later than it was supposed to be, by the way. I'd rather wait a little bit while

339
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:33,740
for a better quality. I suppose. I was a little weird with what I saw at E3. I kind of liked,

340
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,780
you know, of course I liked the nationwide wireless thing, but it didn't, I was expecting

341
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:42,740
kind of a port of the GameCube version, and it really wasn't. It was really different.

342
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:47,300
So I just, I hope it has that fun factor, because that's really what it's all about,

343
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:56,300
right? So we'll see. Anyway, anything else? Just up on the Silent Hill movie. Oh, cool.

344
00:23:56,300 --> 00:24:02,300
Let me see, because I found a release date on it, and I'm going to take this as a tentative date because I haven't seen too much official.

345
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:06,300
According to bloodydisgusting.com, it says...

346
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,300
Great website name.

347
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Well, it's...

348
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,300
I know.

349
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,300
If you want your zombie movies, that's the place to go.

350
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,300
Right.

351
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
April 21st, 2006.

352
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
I'll be there.

353
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
You know I will be there.

354
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,300
Absolutely.

355
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,440
And also there was an article an interview up on IGN

356
00:24:25,580 --> 00:24:31,100
Where it was I can never pronounce this guy's name Patrick Teutopolis

357
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:39,500
Was stating that the director had told him to make in fact, I'm gonna quote Patrick

358
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:44,140
I want those guys to look like they are made of plastic which is exactly the opposite of what we try to do usually

359
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:53,040
usually. They're going for a very surreal, very, this can't really happen look. And

360
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:58,020
then a lot of what they're trying to do is, they're having to redevelop some technology

361
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,020
for it.

362
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,940
Please be a video game movie that doesn't suck. Please, please, please.

363
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:06,540
Checking the scenery though, it's at least going to visually be right. Reading the storyline

364
00:25:06,540 --> 00:25:09,940
so far, it's going to be pretty dead on.

365
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:10,940
We'll see.

366
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
All right.

367
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:14,960
Those of you guys that listen to our three hour program on Sunday nights, Orange Lounge

368
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:19,680
Radio Live, which is broadcast through our station at Live 365, for more information

369
00:25:19,680 --> 00:25:20,960
check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

370
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,300
You heard this.

371
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:27,720
One of our listeners actually called in saying that on Live Journal he had seen a picture

372
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,240
of somebody who had picked up Wee Hart Katamari from Target this weekend.

373
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:37,480
Wee Hart Katamari is not supposed to be out until when?

374
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,480
Like later this month.

375
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,480
The 21st.

376
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,600
is when the Wii Heart Katamari was supposed to be on.

377
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:46,440
So we were curious if Target broke street or if this game, if this image was photoshopped

378
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,440
or what have you.

379
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:51,720
And on Target's website it says they're not even doing any of the ship, they're not gonna

380
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,020
have the game through their website until the 22nd.

381
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:58,120
So we looked at the receipt and we figured out which Target store it was that was selling

382
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:00,640
the game early so we gave them a call.

383
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,560
So here's a clip from the live 3 hour program of what happened when we gave this Target

384
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,840
store a call asking if they had any Wii Heart Katamari in stock.

385
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Keep in mind, um, this was made on September 11th at about 8 in the evening.

386
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,880
**phone ringing**

387
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,280
Electrometers?

388
00:26:19,740 --> 00:26:22,840
Uh, yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.

389
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:24,680
It's We Love Katamari.

390
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,680
Let me check, hang on.

391
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,480
Yeah, SD?

392
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:29,920
Those are on the next aisle.

393
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,120
I'm sorry, what was the game again?

394
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,120
It's We Love Katamari.

395
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:39,320
Yeah, we have one left.

396
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:40,320
You do have one left in stock?

397
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,320
Yes, we do.

398
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,320
Okay, great.

399
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,320
Thank you.

400
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,320
Uh-huh.

401
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,320
All right, bye-bye.

402
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,320
So get that.

403
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:49,460
This store actually admitted that they had one left in stock on the shelf.

404
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,000
Go figure.

405
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:58,680
So some copies of We Heart Katamari are getting out there a little bit early, so hopefully

406
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:02,160
some of our listeners of the live program ran out there to the store and probably picked

407
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,320
up that last copy already, but we'll see.

408
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,700
I did confirm that at least none of the local GameStops have gotten it.

409
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,280
None of the local GameStops. We actually called some targets around here. One of the targets

410
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,860
around here said that they would be putting the game out on shelves Tuesday.

411
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:18,020
Yep. Which is very interesting because the game wasn't supposed to be out until the 21st.

412
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:22,220
So are they doing an early... did the release get bumped up? Who knows?

413
00:27:22,220 --> 00:27:26,340
Not officially. But if you are hearing stories about We Heart Katamari

414
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,500
getting out there early

415
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,540
it is possible. We called them and sure enough they're selling it.

416
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:34,980
Moving on, let's get to the mailbag.

417
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:39,060
Let's do tonight's mailbag, shall we? Of course you can always send us an email

418
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:44,860
togo, t-o-g-o, at orangelaungeradio.com

419
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:49,520
We only have one email tonight. I'm reading this one, correct? Yes?

420
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:53,720
Okay, I'll go ahead. That's alright. We got an email from

421
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,500
Aaron C. Is this the same one we read a couple weeks ago?

422
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,500
I think so. Is this the same person?

423
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:02,500
This makes me very regretful that I wasn't here last week.

424
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:06,500
I'm sorry. Well, let's read it. Let's see what's on Aaron's mind. This is a follow-up mail.

425
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:15,500
Seriously, once again, you frothed with rage about parents' responsibilities, totally ignoring the point that consumers have a right to be informed.

426
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:23,500
To utilize your oft-used movie analogy, let's say Paramount produces a flick called Loki Has Brain Damage.

427
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:28,660
It goes through the MPAA and ends up rated R for violence, foul language and excessive

428
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,660
retardation.

429
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,260
I always allow my 12 year old to see R rated movies so I let him go.

430
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:39,140
Now unbeknownst to the rating board, Paramount secretly slips 5 minutes of close up anal

431
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,580
penetration at the end of the credits.

432
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:47,240
This hot anal action actually means that this film should have received an NC-17 rating.

433
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:51,660
I didn't want my kid to see this, I had been duped as a consumer.

434
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:54,200
This is an identical situation to the Hot Coffee mod.

435
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,780
If a parent decides that they will allow their children to play a game rated M, that is not

436
00:28:58,780 --> 00:29:02,160
the same as allowing their children to play a game rated AO.

437
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,160
Get it?

438
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,160
Loki?

439
00:29:04,160 --> 00:29:05,160
Wrong.

440
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,340
That's completely wrong.

441
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,060
Because unlike the Hot Coffee mod, you have to put in external, you have to have a third

442
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,380
party cheat device in order to see it.

443
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:20,060
In other words, I would have had to purchase special goggles to watch this movie to decode

444
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,300
the image that was on there to see the anal penetration.

445
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,300
That is the difference.

446
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,900
DarkSakura, you wanted to respond to this earlier.

447
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:33,540
Actually, that is a very good point, however, I can see it both ways.

448
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:39,300
In one way, let the buyer beware.

449
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:47,100
There is always a degree of caution that someone has to make with any purchase.

450
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:54,780
really and I think that when you're dealing with how many different

451
00:29:54,780 --> 00:30:00,000
departments you have with the game publisher being that I know many people

452
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:06,200
now who work for various publishers you what the what the programmers leave in

453
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:12,240
is not necessarily going to be found by the testers unless you know you've got

454
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:18,000
true the testers are playing on debug units and they are meant to break the

455
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:22,300
game every way they can do everything possible and are given usually a set

456
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,880
assignment for how the game should be played when they're testing it. However

457
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:32,800
something that is programmed into a game that has had that bit of programming

458
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:38,560
removed to access it on average is not going to be found. So it is very likely

459
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:44,440
that nobody except the programmers had any idea that this was in the game and

460
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:50,000
though some random person it could have been found by some random person who

461
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,360
said oh well look what I just found coding for in the game you know and if

462
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:59,440
they find it on PC of course you know the PlayStation 1 came after the PC one

463
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,360
when they said oh it's here let's see if it's in here or it could just be a

464
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:08,240
program I did I that's a very similar thing to what I've always said is that

465
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,980
that the programmers put it in there

466
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,480
and they made a decision to take it out.

467
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,860
I imagine somebody at Rockstar said,

468
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:16,100
you know what, this is crossing the line,

469
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,580
this is gonna get us an AO, take this out of the game.

470
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,460
And what the programmers did,

471
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,380
instead of actually physically removing it from the game,

472
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,540
they just took out the pointer.

473
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,380
Easier, right?

474
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,200
It's a lot easier.

475
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,300
And it also keeps, instead of having

476
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,060
to rewrite part of the code,

477
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,380
it's a lot easier to remove part of it

478
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:30,820
and make sure that your game ships on date.

479
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,100
And you know what, and I bet you,

480
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:33,620
but here's the thing, you know,

481
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,820
so to try and get past this here,

482
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,700
because we could talk about this

483
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,740
until we're blue in the face,

484
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:40,300
rest assured this will never happen again this is not the first game this

485
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,180
has happened with either

486
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:45,500
oh no no no bloody roar 3 yeah you put it in debug mode you get

487
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,620
necky you know masturbatory photos of the characters in the game

488
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:53,460
I'd even talked about last week a little more innocent the hidden song in DDR

489
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,180
quote-unquote

490
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:58,500
um although some folks have actually sent me an email that linked me to a

491
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:00,340
thread on DDR freak where

492
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:04,200
some inside sources are saying that that song is actually supposed to be

493
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,000
unlockable

494
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:08,840
just nobody's figured it out yet but I don't know if nobody's unlocked it at

495
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,000
this point I don't think they're going to so whatever

496
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,360
but the point is is that basically

497
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,920
it was lazy programming issue and it's brought this whole debate to the front

498
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:23,680
I think that there was a large portion of Rockstar that didn't realize that this

499
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,480
was going to be found they did not intend for this be found it did

500
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:30,000
now they're taking the heat for it and rest assured this lazy programming incident will

501
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,560
never happen again because that testing process will be changed to prevent this

502
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:33,280
from ever happening

503
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,160
to some- a future game because Rockstar's taking a lot of heat for it.

504
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:36,660
Oh, on top of that.

505
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:39,200
And, you know, should they, shouldn't they? I don't know.

506
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:43,600
I mean, I- it's- it's not- not an easy answer because you could say,

507
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,600
were they ignorant or did they know what they were doing? We don't know.

508
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,160
And in the movie analogy, sorry, um, remember The Rescuers?

509
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:53,680
With the little-

510
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,200
Oh, yeah, they always say they put sex things in the Disney movies and stuff.

511
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,640
And they did in Roger Rabbit.

512
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know.

513
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:04,080
but the thing is is that the only way that this would have ever really been

514
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:08,800
the average eye is going to see it as a blip across the screen right like one time i would

515
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:14,160
i was watching a cartoon that i used to tape when i lived in alabama i don't remember what it was

516
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:19,440
and i saw the color changed weirdly i went back and freeze framed it on a picture of the american

517
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:25,920
flag that the animators just happened to stick in there interesting or even places where there

518
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:29,440
were missing frames the average person isn't going to see that unless they take an effort

519
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:41,440
And if this person is saying that they monitor what their kids are watching, obviously for them to go have a third party cheat device, cheat in the game, then go into this, you're not monitoring what your kids are doing.

520
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:47,440
So you know what, you're the blame still, and you know what, you can't come and bitch about Rockstar saying,

521
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:53,120
about you know Rockstar saying oh no oh this wasn't supposed to be the game the

522
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:57,980
game's maturity it's for over 17 you know what adults only is over 18 one

523
00:33:57,980 --> 00:34:02,020
year difference we're talking nothing that's like the difference between PG

524
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:06,960
and pg-13 there is really no difference and you know what you really should be

525
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,360
monitoring what your kids are watching you shouldn't be playing the games the

526
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:12,280
first place if you let them go the r-rated movies anyways they're probably

527
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:17,080
seeing real boobies in those r-rated films and this pixelated representation

528
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,880
of what is supposed to be sex and mind you the Carl Johnson character the main

529
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,480
male in it does not get naked in this because it was unfinished does not get

530
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:31,640
naked only the woman so it's not even oh my god they saw you know penis and ass

531
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:38,040
you know it's just pixelated boobies okay and mature rated games like God of

532
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:42,040
War they have you know non pixelated boobies it's full rendered you know

533
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:46,040
high-res boobies in there and there's actual sex games in that but do you hear

534
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,280
them complain about this

535
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:50,880
no why because rockstar they're going to come after but I guess you're fine with

536
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:51,320
your kids

537
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:54,400
the reason why is because

538
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,000
you knew that in God of War this you did not nobody knew that there would be the

539
00:34:59,000 --> 00:34:59,640
sex thing

540
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:04,080
in the game I'm sorry you know calling you know the racist people murdering the

541
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,720
blacks and stuff in the gang violence that's okay but you know

542
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,800
boobies not okay I'm sorry I'm just saying

543
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
but in defense though I do think that

544
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,720
Rockstar was at fault. Because of a lazy programmer, yes.

545
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:22,920
Exactly, and no matter who it is in the company, as long as that game was released

546
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:23,840
that company has

547
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:27,480
a legal requirement to make sure that the

548
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,080
product that they put out on the market is exactly what they're advertising.

549
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:34,840
I agree and that's where I think you're getting a little off Loki is because

550
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:38,000
that this is the issue the issue is not oh my god somebody saw digitized

551
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:38,460
boobies

552
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:42,180
but the issue is is that Rockstar did not tell anyone that was in the game

553
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:43,360
whereas with God of War

554
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,480
they said yeah full-on female boobies everywhere

555
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:50,440
K but with this game they said they didn't sell there's no sexy sure you

556
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:52,360
can blow people's heads off with rocket launchers whatever

557
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,120
but there is no hardcore sex in the game and turned out bonus there was hard

558
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:56,640
course

559
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,780
X am I am I ever alright as you know because

560
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:05,320
I'm going to be a parent in a couple years mmm when you buy something that

561
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:09,480
and trust me I remember fully well with devious little child I was

562
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:13,480
That's not the end of your responsibility.

563
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,840
There is such a thing called maintenance.

564
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,520
Alright, we gotta, we gotta move on, because we could beat this topic into the ground.

565
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,900
It's just, you know, I hate hearing you. I say from here on out, no more hot coffee,

566
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:27,760
ever. Or take it to the forums. The only, yeah, put it, go, go to our website, go to

567
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:32,240
orangellensradio.com. Send Loki a personal email, loki at orangellensradio.com.

568
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:37,120
I'm just personally sick of these people going, I'm your rockstar, didn't tell me what's in the game!

569
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,680
It doesn't matter, you don't read the label anyways,

570
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:41,200
because it says don't, no, not suited for kids

571
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,720
under the age of 17, so you're ignoring the label as is,

572
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:45,560
it wouldn't matter if they said

573
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:47,760
there was people getting fucked in the game.

574
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,040
It doesn't matter.

575
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,520
Some people, language is their thing,

576
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,880
some people, violence is their thing,

577
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,080
some people, sex is their thing,

578
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:56,720
and there was certainly violence being advertised.

579
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,000
I really think that in the end,

580
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,560
it shouldn't be the responsibility

581
00:36:59,560 --> 00:37:01,880
of the video game company to censor their product.

582
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:03,980
However, I do think they should make sure

583
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,640
that the consumer is fully aware

584
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,680
of the product that they're purchasing.

585
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:11,120
can agree with that alright moving on moving on let's talk about coffee I ever

586
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:16,120
want to see is the kind of get Starbucks alright let's move on speaking of Grand

587
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:21,240
Theft Auto San Andreas that re-release without the coffee mod it will be coming

588
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:26,720
out next week which I suppose as a little footnote to the story look how

589
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,800
long it took for that patch to come out that's how long this game would have

590
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:34,160
been delayed if they'd gone back and done what they should have done just

591
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:44,080
just food for thought murder murder in China based on a MMORPG according to the

592
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:49,220
Beijing Morning Post a young woman has been charged with murdering her fiance

593
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:55,720
for quote too much time playing online games I think that's it no more online

594
00:37:55,720 --> 00:38:02,420
games for the Chinese ever stop the woman in question apparently got fed up

595
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:08,060
with her unemployed fiance for spending more time online than looking for a job

596
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:13,060
so he could pay for the wedding so on August 6th allegedly she did the deed

597
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:18,380
you know what if I had been spending all this time married to Dan or engaged to

598
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:23,420
Dan and he wasn't getting off his ass looking for well actually we did spend a

599
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:28,300
year like that then again he had he had money and that we had the money in the

600
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:32,100
bank to afford it we could afford for him to not work however you know it had

601
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:36,300
it had that money not been there and you know I was having to support him or he

602
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:42,380
was just sitting on his ass I'd left him shit yeah it's because I have a brain in

603
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:45,460
my head and I use it oh it's just interesting I mean instead of dumping

604
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:50,620
his ass she shot him or whatever she did say I don't want to know either way

605
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:56,060
you're without him you know and now you've got a deal with finding a date

606
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,020
when you get out of the prison I guess only they were playing more the hot

607
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:01,780
coffee mod they would have learned that they can solve their problems by having

608
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:08,700
no more hot coffee stop right now hot coffee talk is banned from the podcast

609
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:15,220
all right you know what we I'm gonna make a game called hot cop more than

610
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:19,020
ever we need some of dark Sakura's advice column because if we stayed

611
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:23,860
inside and played video games all day long we'd have no time to um get

612
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:29,460
murdered by our fiancees so dark Sakura has her advice column for us and dark

613
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:32,660
Sakura what are you going to be telling us about tonight today's bit of advice

614
00:39:32,660 --> 00:39:39,380
is how to drown your co-host of hot coffee oh wait how to escape from a car

615
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:44,420
hanging over the edge of the cliff number one do not shift your weight or

616
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:49,100
make any sudden movements to if the front doors are still over land use

617
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,700
these doors to make your escape regardless of which way your car is

618
00:39:51,700 --> 00:40:00,700
2. If the front doors are over the edge, proceed slowly to the rear of the car.

619
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:05,900
3. Reassess your situation and make your escape. Will opening the rear doors cause the car

620
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:10,860
to slide? If not, open them slowly and get out. Otherwise, use a steering wheel lock

621
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:15,180
or screwdriver to break the window and climb out as quickly as possible.

622
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:24,340
My final piece of advice, I have two actually, either don't pull a Thelma and Louise or make

623
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:27,720
sure that you have one of those drag strip parachutes attached to the back of your car

624
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,380
so at least when you land it will be softer.

625
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:36,000
Or how about don't drive off cliffs, that would be my advice, don't drive off cliffs.

626
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,380
Don't drive anywhere but in Colorado.

627
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,380
What?

628
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,380
Flatland.

629
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:43,100
Don't talk on your cell phone while driving.

630
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
Wait a minute! Colorado has the Rockies!

631
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:50,100
I'm talking about the flat part. It's kind of hard to drive your car up a mountain.

632
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:55,100
Anyway, there's cliffs on a mountain. Forget it. Forget it.

633
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:58,100
The only cliffs I care about are Cliff Notes.

634
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,100
Nintendo is going to be moving into the mobile phone market.

635
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:06,100
No games just yet. No cell phone Mario. No cell phone Zelda.

636
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:13,300
Zelda. However, on October 17th, Nintendo Mobile will be providing subscribers with

637
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:18,480
video game related content such as wallpapers, ringtones, and sound effects from the Super

638
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:22,380
Mario Brothers series. Oh, one thing I should note, this is in Japan only.

639
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:27,160
Duh, like I told you that. No, but I actually are going to be porting over the classic games

640
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:30,240
from what I hear. Some classic games are already available on

641
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,920
Cell Phone. Like, I had Castlevania on my Cell Phone, but it kind of sucked. I mean,

642
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,320
Cell phone games cell phone is not the place to be gaming

643
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:42,040
It you a couple puzzle games are okay because I like that before crisis game

644
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:45,120
That was pretty fun on the final fantasy. I just saw crisis

645
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:51,060
I know I don't I don't think I think even before it was gonna suck only be good if they re-release it to the PSP

646
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,200
I just cell phone is not the place to be gaming because you know at least I'm on my phone most of the games are

647
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,200
Java based and it's slow and just a puzzle game works

648
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,200
okay but not a fast-paced puzzle game like Tetris even sucks. I've seen better games on a

649
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:08,200
freaking graphing calculator. I've seen better games on the Apple IIe.

650
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:12,200
Loadrunner, kick! Oregon Trail, yo.

651
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:16,200
Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world?

652
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:20,200
Well, um, the group We Are Back is still teasing the fact

653
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,200
that they're going to be releasing a downgrader. This will downgrade everything from 2.0

654
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:28,200
on to, um, you know, back to 1. And

655
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,920
That's going to be it right there.

656
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:36,780
Homebrew is going to be loud for everybody and yeah, so anyways, so that's what's going

657
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:37,780
on there.

658
00:42:37,780 --> 00:42:41,460
They're also having some homebrew contests for PSP games which is kind of interesting

659
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:47,540
so they have some entries for that that are actually they're kind of plugging on PSP updates.

660
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:49,960
Some of them look pretty interesting.

661
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:54,740
Also a program was released the other day actually that you can change the little intro

662
00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:00,820
video on you have a little small clip that plays when you turn on your PSP or

663
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:04,380
play game or whatever you can change that and they have a demonstration on

664
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:08,660
there on how to do that as well so you can customize your PSP a little bit more

665
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:19,100
and other than that really not too much else going on with the PSP now I should

666
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,220
also say oh one more thing I almost forgot they're actually releasing

667
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:33,220
another emulator of course coming out and that one was for, oh what was it, I don't remember.

668
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:39,720
Anyways, enough of that. Let's see, other than that lots of homebrew stuff coming out for the DS

669
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:45,820
because you know the DS isn't to be forgotten and yeah so just we'll have to wait for the down

670
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:52,720
grader. They're still saying a couple more weeks and then the shit will hit the fan. Yeah.

671
00:43:52,720 --> 00:44:00,960
All right, moving on, a couple last stories here for tonight's, Civilization 4 is going

672
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,660
to be doing a little pre-order program, a special limited edition collector's package,

673
00:44:05,660 --> 00:44:12,640
which has collector's packaging, a CD soundtrack of the game, a keyboard template, a tech map,

674
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:17,840
and a spiral bound version of the manual, so that's just a special pre-order edition.

675
00:44:17,840 --> 00:44:20,000
Civilization 4, of course, coming out this October.

676
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,400
I'm interested in it. I love, love, love, love, love, love, love the original Civilization

677
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,200
game. Never really got into Civ 2 or 3. Why? I don't know. I think they just, they got

678
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:34,800
too complex for me at that point or something or just, I don't know. I liked it simple,

679
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:39,880
and simple graphics, simple, you know, mechanics to the game and everything, so the first one's

680
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:45,320
my favorite. But, I am very curious about 4 and I'll definitely give it a try. I'm certainly

681
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:49,320
to see what they've done with the series since 3.

682
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Mega Man is going to be making an appearance at the

683
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,320
Tokyo Game Show in Capcom's booth. The interesting thing is that the game

684
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:01,320
is called Rockman Rockman, which would be Mega Man Mega Man.

685
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,320
Which game now? It's called Rockman Rockman.

686
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Yeah, it's a remake of the first Mega Man. Yeah, I was going to get to that.

687
00:45:09,320 --> 00:45:13,320
It happens to be it's going to be a remake of the

688
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,460
original Mega Man game is the rumor about what it's going to be but we

689
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:21,360
don't know exactly what system it's going to be on but they're saying PSP it

690
00:45:21,360 --> 00:45:26,380
is probably and they actually have the site has launched for it I know that

691
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:31,540
part yeah the site has launched for it let's see if I can pull it up here to

692
00:45:31,540 --> 00:45:36,720
see what the site was it looks really interesting Mega Man's very it's very

693
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:41,880
cartoony unlike you know the original Mega Man his head is ginormous which I

694
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:47,120
don't know why they they did it that way but um it's interesting you can actually

695
00:45:47,120 --> 00:45:51,720
make your own levels on it which is pretty cool

696
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:55,920
wait you can make your own level yeah has a level editor built into it that's

697
00:45:55,920 --> 00:46:02,520
cool that's very cool it's coming out for the PSP and I can't remember the

698
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:06,920
website but I will find it out and while we're talking and let you guys know

699
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:09,560
we're almost at the end of show I only got one more story I'll be hurry I'll

700
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:15,560
Alright, last story here. We always seem to talk about these video games that are being turned into movies.

701
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:24,560
MTV, hooray hooray, bought the film rights to Midway's The Suffering.

702
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:30,560
Of course, The Suffering, the ties that bind is coming out very soon. Another one of them kind of scary games.

703
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:35,560
Executive Vice President of MTV Films, David Gale, says,

704
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,280
We are very excited to be working hand in hand with Midway to translate this innovative

705
00:46:39,280 --> 00:46:41,880
game into an edge of your seat film.

706
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:44,840
Gaming is such a huge part of the culture for MTV's audience.

707
00:46:44,840 --> 00:46:49,160
It makes perfect sense for us to work with Midway, Stan Winston, and Circle of Confusion

708
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:51,360
on bringing The Suffering to life as a feature film.

709
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:54,600
Yes, that's why I think it's interesting that it says gaming is such a huge part of the

710
00:46:54,600 --> 00:46:59,920
culture for MTV's audience, when I can't think of many gaming shows that MTV has aired.

711
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:05,000
Maybe a special here and there, but in a category on their video music awards, but not really

712
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,000
huge part of the network. Then again, music videos aren't a huge part of the network either.

713
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,000
I think they're referring to their audience themselves.

714
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:16,000
I suppose. But, anyway. I guess we'll see when we get some stars and directors attached,

715
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
but all we know for now is that MTV is producing them. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

716
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,000
MTV, you know, even though I'm knocking on them a little bit, they've actually put out

717
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
some pretty good films. Um, Election, from a couple years ago, is like one of my favorite

718
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,000
movies. It's great. And MTV was actually behind that, so. Go figure.

719
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:34,000
And one that I like that's coming out pretty soon, um, was it Role Balance? Looks interesting.

720
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,000
Weren't they behind Napoleon Dynamite too?

721
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,000
I want to say yes.

722
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:39,000
I think so.

723
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:41,000
Even though that movie kind of...

724
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:46,000
I like Napoleon Dynamite and all, but dang, they kind of beat that thing into the ground.

725
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,000
With the shirts and everything.

726
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,000
Yeah.

727
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,000
It was funny. It was really, really funny even, but it wasn't that funny.

728
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:52,000
Anyway.

729
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:55,000
Loki, did you find it? Otherwise, it's going to have to wait until next week.

730
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,000
It'll have to wait until next week.

731
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
Alright, final thoughts. Dark Sakura.

732
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,000
Reject all psychons.

733
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
My final thought is...

734
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,480
I don't know I'm gonna go play Silent Hill 4 because I got my copy back from

735
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:11,200
Dark Sakura thank you. You're welcome. Loki your final thought. Happy birthday to me. That's

736
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:16,320
right happy birthday to you. And for your birthday I had Final Fantasy 7 Advent

737
