145726	149827	Other stuff, including my obsession with We Heart Katamari as of this week.
150327	152768	I cannot stop playing this game.
153168	154728	That's a highly sore point with me.
155408	157809	No one at my work wanted it, so I got it by default.
158823	163326	Wow, okay, well, we'll get to all things Bomani and all things gaming.
163386	164766	And I get to see face in the groove!
165347	168148	And all things random, yes, and tonight we're doing another giveaway.
168588	171770	Well, I don't know, it might not just be tonight, we might do something throughout the week, we'll see.
172391	175592	We're gonna be giving away a copy of In the Groove, Loki style.
175612	180135	Alright, we'll be back after this intro.

312370	312710	And this...
313170	313870	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers
338937	339878	I totally just lied.
340238	341479	She's not a bunny.
342860	343900	She's a giggling schoolgirl.
343940	345582	We established that on the last podcast.
346802	347563	Oh, I got the glare.
347923	348824	I got the glare, kids.
348924	350145	I don't find that funny at all.
350585	350845	Sorry.
351446	353007	Because I don't appreciate sexism.
353607	354988	We'll be talking about that later on.
355969	358510	Um, actually, okay.
358530	359031	All right.
359051	359491	Good.
360011	361092	Good to hear.
361152	362013	It probably pissed me off.
362533	364995	All right, we'll be talking about...
366047	367768	Reasons for that throughout tonight's show.
368188	370470	Also, say hello to Techmaster Loki.
370890	376913	I appreciate all forms of sex, including those with, you know, whatever suffixes you have.
378134	378374	What?
380015	382096	Sexism, sex, you name it.
382296	383037	Oh, I get it.
383317	383617	I think.
385158	386098	I know, it went over your head.
386118	386459	It's okay.
386479	386999	Yeah, that's all right.
387139	390061	I have a big block of cheese I'm nibbling on.
390981	392742	Loki just snacks on cheese during the show.
393222	394283	It's a big block of Parmesan cheese.
395465	397446	This isn't the first time either.
397847	401409	Also here tonight, say hello to the resident poppin' music whore.
403030	403970	Mr. Garrett, over there.
404170	405211	Hello, how are you?
405891	406992	I'm good, I'm a whore.
407512	409874	Yes, you are a whore, but you also play games.
410074	410994	Yeah.
411434	413295	This whore's on vacation, so this whore's happy.
414136	416838	Oh, congratulations.
416878	421640	Say hello also to the one and only TechMassa intern, Bugged.
422801	423601	Intern my ass.
425391	427652	Well, we already have a tech master, so you have to be the intern.
428192	429112	How about specialist?
430272	430792	That might work.
431012	431653	Tech specialist.
431793	432433	Tech specialist.
432813	434433	I do have two laptops on me at the moment.
434613	435133	Tech bitch.
435974	436434	Tech bitch.
436654	437174	I like bitch.
438274	438674	Minion.
439474	440055	Okay, maybe.
440135	440835	I will take minion.
440855	441335	Minion.
441555	444055	I like minion because it makes me sound evil.
444856	445236	Exactly.
445256	445576	We'll see.
446536	448477	Anyway, as we promised tonight, show should be fun.
448497	449537	We're going to give some shit away.
449577	451917	We're going to talk about the Ultramix 3 VRare.
451937	454078	We're going to play a lot of tracks from the Ultramix 3 VRare.
455269	463852	and we're going to talk about DDR EX 2 which is out this week and you know some of the other game stuff we've been doing too and what's going on in the music game world.
464572	476395	Also tonight we're going to preview some tracks from a particular album that was just released recently so stay tuned to see what tracks are going to do from that and a whole lot more.
476695	482797	So let's get to it, let's get to our first break and we'll come back and do a little bit of How was your week, how was your day and your calls later on this evening.
483497	485199	Ask Orange Lounge if we have time.
485219	496889	This break we're not going to get straight to the Ultramix 3 because I heard some folks in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com they were gushing over Chorus K so I'm going to throw some Chorus K their way and make them happy.
496949	497289	So here it is.
497309	498870	We're going to start off with a little Love is Eternity.
499090	500792	What does Dell fill their laptops with?
501472	501833	I don't know.
501873	505496	That was scary during the opening.
505536	509019	Anyway, we'll be back after this after some Love is Eternity here on Orange Lounge Radio.
669629	670972	Thanks for watching!
734088	735023	Thanks for watching!
779088	779709	Thanks for watching!
849787	851010	We are the planet on the run
886716	892239	We are the landings from the sun We're all like landings from the sun We are the landings from the sun
940387	946732	Because we're like lemons on the run We are the lemons on the run We are like lemons on the run We are the lemons on the run
968004	968984	Gaming Radio.
969224	976467	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
976667	978007	Orange Lounge Radio.
979608	982108	We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
982568	984749	And in that break you heard a little bit of Love is Eternity.
985990	990651	Atomic Kitten from Third Style slash Fifth Mix right now.
991522	996263	Ryu Setsugeka from TenStyle, and Erotic Lemmings on the Run from In the Groove.
996823	998244	Why would I play an In the Groove song?
998264	1001165	Because we're going to be doing an In the Groove game giveaway.
1002565	1004326	I don't know if we're doing that tonight.
1004366	1007446	We have to think of the rules for how we want the giveaway to work, so we're going to talk about that.
1007807	1013168	However, this copy of In the Groove has a special treat with it.
1013228	1014708	It's not just any copy of In the Groove.
1014989	1020110	It is an In the Groove copy signed by Loki, DarkSakura, and myself.
1020839	1023781	with our own little sayings on it for you guys
1038482	1039683	V-Rares for DDR Max 2 and DDR EX 2
1055399	1056460	Unless you can find them.
1056960	1060523	So, what we're going to do, we're going to give away, I guess we'll give them away in Paris.
1060643	1063605	We'll give away an EX-2 and MAX-2 CD together.
1064266	1069629	And all you've got to do, we'll give away one tonight, live on the show, and then we'll give away one through our podcast.
1069910	1070250	Sound good?
1070270	1071231	Alright, cool.
1071551	1079997	So, what you're going to do, you want to get in now, because there's thousands of people that listen to the podcast, but there's probably only about 12 that listen to this program.
1080337	1082659	No, I'm kidding, it's more than that, but it's significantly less.
1084102	1085923	Get your name in now if you want to win one of these.
1086243	1093248	All you have to do, it's easy, you don't even have to think about it, just send an email to freestuff at orangeloungeradio.com.
1093588	1097611	Free stuff, all one word, freestuff at orangeloungeradio.com.
1098172	1102054	One entry per person, if you enter twice, I'm going to beat you up.
1102935	1105196	I say entering twice is a disqualification.
1105316	1108799	That's right, if you enter twice, we'll ban you.
1110100	1111500	Just like you were a Ragnarok player.
1111540	1112081	We will ban you.
1112121	1112481	No, I'm kidding.
1112921	1114181	We will just ban you.
1114241	1116202	So just one entry per person, please.
1116982	1118062	And we're going to give that away.
1118322	1124964	Now, if you enter right now, you'll also be entered for the one we're going to do on the podcast anyway because I'm going to check from the same email account.
1125304	1127945	So get in now before the night is over.
1128345	1129885	So you've got a couple hours there.
1131005	1132766	Do those of us currently here qualify?
1133406	1133526	No.
1133546	1133586	No.
1134926	1136547	Because some of us in the room already have them.
1136647	1138587	Yeah, some of us can get them other ways.
1139147	1139968	Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.
1140188	1143049	But these are authentic copies of EX2.
1143369	1147230	No, you cannot just send me a message because I'm overwhelmed with private messages as it is.
1147570	1148331	We want to collect them.
1148351	1153712	Plus, there are some people that are just shy and don't want to join the chat room, so we can let them send an email.
1154032	1157494	All you have to do, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
1157534	1159994	And again, this is not for the In The Groove giveaway.
1160335	1164356	This is for the Extreme 2 slash Max 2 VRares.
1165014	1166995	DarkSakura My week was just
1191997	1194759	Eh, regular stuff.
1196700	1199002	I played a few games, hung out.
1199262	1204906	I mean, Dan was gone most of the week at the GameStop manager conference in Texas.
1205767	1218216	So I sat around by myself a lot, except for going to a party, going to the club, playing with my Nintendogs, playing some Beatmania, playing World of Warcraft.
1219813	1220614	Really, that's about it.
1220674	1224957	Oh yeah, and I played on the main for a little bit, a bit more Puyo Puyo arcade version.
1226018	1229742	And Blazing Star and Pulsar, or Pulsar, I'm sorry.
1230662	1237368	And Metal Slug 5 and a bunch of crap just because I was really bored hanging out in the garage doing laundry.
1238549	1238709	And...
1243456	1245940	That's really how my week went.
1246000	1250466	Dan came home today, which was good, and then he promptly left to go play Madden at the neighbor's house.
1251903	1253304	which he said, oh, I told you.
1253404	1257346	I was like, well, you didn't tell me where I could actually hear you when you were in the same room with me.
1258067	1258907	So I didn't know.
1258947	1259468	He just disappeared.
1259488	1263210	So I got involved in a project and he came like, oh, you want to play Madden with me?
1263990	1266212	That game sucks and American football sucks.
1266832	1269173	Why would I want to do something that doubly sucks?
1269774	1270414	That's okay.
1270894	1272335	I'm doing something that doesn't suck.
1274522	1278205	Now, you said in the intro you were a little bitter over We Heart Katamari.
1278226	1278726	What's up?
1278986	1280307	Because... How can you be bitter?
1280327	1282109	Data Game came out at GameStop.
1282930	1283871	He was on the plane.
1284371	1285372	He couldn't buy my game.
1285612	1289236	Because I can wait a little bit to get something at a 30% discount.
1290117	1292159	I don't see paying full price when I don't have to.
1293119	1294000	I am a frugal gamer.
1295422	1295602	So...
1296397	1297478	and I'll see you next time.
1325518	1333361	Well, yeah, I've played the Japanese one, but they talk about it as though I have it now and I don't have it yet and act like it's the end of the world.
1333661	1334981	I'm like, fuck you!
1335681	1336962	I didn't get it the day it came out.
1337202	1338202	I got it yesterday.
1339483	1342203	I don't really care to hear anything about that.
1342504	1346865	And on top of that, with all the hype that's been going on, I've hit my saturation point of Katamari.
1348735	1349896	I'll tell you, it is really good, though.
1350076	1350916	I wasn't disappointed.
1354078	1355219	I think you'll have a change of heart.
1355359	1355599	I do.
1355859	1356059	I do.
1356160	1358401	Honestly, I really don't care when I get it.
1359141	1366606	As soon as I can go 24 hours without seeing or hearing the word Katamari, I will play it.
1368714	1373957	I'm not joking because I have not been able to go that long without either hearing it or seeing it.
1374377	1380381	So when I can go 24 hours without hearing or seeing the word Katamari, I will play it.
1381101	1382242	Alright, that could be a while.
1383863	1385143	It's today's secret word.
1385503	1387805	When you hear today's secret word, scream real loud.
1390126	1392547	Today's secret word is Katamari.
1393588	1395449	So when you hear today's secret word, scream real loud.
1398373	1399173	Loki, how was your week?
1399213	1399753	How was your day?
1400634	1403374	I can't start off like I was going to, but okay.
1404234	1404755	My week was good.
1404775	1406515	We actually got a lot of the wedding stuff done.
1407015	1408015	Location's done.
1409276	1411316	She has her dress, you know, being ordered.
1411656	1412356	That's all done.
1412937	1413617	Just, we're done.
1413957	1415597	So, thank God!
1415617	1417738	Nice of the wait.
1418378	1419198	Play the waiting game now.
1420999	1424499	No, but actually, I meant to play more games this week.
1424599	1426700	I played a lot of Burnout Revenge, per usual.
1427396	1433500	and my one gripe of Burnout Revenge is their random track selection isn't quite random.
1433620	1442887	In fact, I get the same track every time I do random, so I'm kind of wondering why, you know, it's so faulty, but it's still a fun track.
1443707	1446149	And then, let's see, what else?
1446289	1456956	Oh, I got my free copy of We Love Katamari, and I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet, and I was trying to make time to play Graffiti Kingdom since I've had it for a month and haven't touched it yet,
1457657	1459578	That's right, I still haven't touched the Hello Kitty game.
1460998	1466241	Well, that I can understand, but, you know, Graffiti Canyon, I was, like, drooling over it, you know, when I got it, and I haven't even played it.
1466781	1475264	But, um, I'll get to it eventually, um, but now I have to go beg, um, my contact to Konami for some copies of, uh, Xtreme 2.
1476065	1480746	I hinted to him that I wanted some, and now I will just bluntly say, can you send me some?
1481887	1482427	So, we'll see.
1483528	1484328	But, uh, yeah.
1484348	1484428	Yeah.
1484807	1488369	and then I've been having this urge to buy stuff and I haven't been able to find anything.
1488489	1494452	I walked around Best Buy aimlessly looking for something to buy and there was just nothing there at all.
1494912	1495152	Nothing.
1497033	1497333	That's all.
1498474	1499655	Oh, and I'm eating a block of cheese.
1499895	1500575	It's almost gone.
1501316	1505758	I have to eat it because I have another block of cheese at home and they're planning on buying me another one.
1506238	1508159	So, you know, S.O.C.
1508179	1509140	Horse Brides, that was fun.
1509580	1510020	It was a good movie.
1512076	1512956	Good times!
1513597	1513837	Alright.
1513857	1514037	Yeah.
1515117	1515917	Bugged, how was your week?
1515937	1516418	How was your day?
1517798	1525121	I did not get a chance to play Burnout 4 because my roommate scored a free Xbox from one of his friends that has been playing Jet Set Radio Future at all hours.
1525781	1527002	So... Nothing wrong with that.
1527322	1529382	We only have one set of hookups at a time.
1530243	1534404	But lots of calamari... That game.
1534544	1535685	Yeah.
1537145	1537746	Lots of that.
1538746	1539886	And I can't kick anyone.
1539946	1540847	Damn, that would be a lot of fun.
1543120	1543880	Oh, you want to kick people?
1543920	1545801	Here, I'll just... Oh, okay.
1546481	1547401	Ooh, yeah!
1548162	1555604	Cool, I get to kick fun... Anyway, I played Trash Pick.
1556925	1557165	What?
1558945	1560886	Played Trash Pick, scored four IMAX last night.
1562046	1562547	What is that?
1563727	1569249	It's where you go around to people's trash, you know, the trash areas, and people have thrown out computers, and there was four IMAX.
1571038	1572439	People throw out iMacs?
1572579	1573279	G3 iMacs.
1573299	1573679	Loki?
1574379	1574599	No.
1574819	1575380	Loki, no.
1576560	1577080	What, Loki?
1578401	1578661	What?
1581682	1583963	I mean, they're good at least for their monitor.
1583983	1590105	I highly say it's wrong to throw out anything that's not broken, especially computer-wise, unless it's really old.
1590605	1591745	Because you can always use them for parts.
1592386	1595507	Even if it is an iMac, you can still part that out for something.
1595727	1596487	That's why we picked them up.
1596627	1597728	For the monitor, at least.
1597888	1598948	Because, you know,
1599905	1602828	Flat screen monitor, you shouldn't throw that away.
1603088	1604909	Oh, no, no, no, these are old ones, these are the CRTs.
1605630	1607231	Oh, well, then they suck.
1608893	1610374	They were where they belonged.
1613176	1614938	How can people throw those away?
1616519	1617340	Oh, oh, okay.
1617360	1621843	Oh my god, you... You didn't throw away another one, I want it.
1623064	1623325	It's a G3.
1624238	1625738	So, I can do something with it.
1626159	1626419	Okay.
1626979	1628959	You can make a flower pot out of it.
1629099	1630540	They need hard drives and RAM, that's about it.
1631240	1632560	Standard stuff.
1632660	1633441	I have all that.
1633681	1641023	And an impromptu barbecue, and we have WeHeart something something something party last night.
1643163	1648245	I believe what they've come up with in the chatroom is WeHeart calamari, like the appetizer, the squid.
1648265	1650946	And everybody's spelling it right, so I just left the chatroom because everyone pissed me off.
1651126	1651566	Aww.
1651626	1652046	Alright.
1653931	1655032	I actually really do, but anyway.
1655052	1656333	But I got up, so I can still kick people.
1656534	1657374	Okay, go for it.
1658696	1659376	That was pretty much it.
1660978	1661278	Alright.
1663380	1665182	Garrett, the pop and music whore of Sacramento.
1665382	1665722	What's up?
1665922	1666303	How was your week?
1666323	1666683	How was your day?
1667083	1669005	My week's gone... How much pop music did you play?
1670487	1671047	Since what?
1671067	1673009	Since like however many months ago I was here?
1673029	1673509	Yeah.
1673750	1673950	Yeah.
1674722	1675443	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1688949	1689169	43, wow.
1689309	1692510	Yeah, I've beaten, I think, five 41s now.
1692650	1694630	I just beat Rinsei EX.
1695131	1700052	I'm like, and then I couldn't do it after that, of course.
1700132	1703413	Do you have any more videos on the interweb of you playing Papa Music?
1703433	1705133	Because I remember there used to be one on Bomani Style.
1705493	1707694	Oh, I didn't even ask him to put that shit up.
1708414	1716596	And then some asshole on Bomani Style totally was just making fun of me for it, and then he submitted his own video of him getting a better score.
1717711	1718031	Whatever.
1718731	1722013	I just sent it to DJ... Some people just have to show how big their wingers are.
1722033	1726114	I just sent it to DJP to show him, like, you know, like, oh, I'm just playing with Adobe right now.
1726134	1728135	I'm, you know, putting this shit together.
1729496	1731556	But, yeah, okay.
1731616	1732417	My week's been alright.
1732497	1736958	I just started vacation on Friday, and I'm on vacation for ten days!
1737078	1737679	Yay!
1737699	1738059	Yay!
1738119	1740940	I'll be five days here and five days in Georgia.
1742261	1743502	What are you doing in Georgia now?
1743662	1744764	I'm going to a wedding.
1745064	1750611	It's this girl I grew up with, and her grandma is one of my mom's best friends.
1750631	1751813	They all live together and whatever.
1752093	1755958	But anyway, since I've never really been out of the state, it'll be like going out of the country for me.
1757100	1758962	And so, I don't know, that'll be fun.
1760737	1762618	Have fun with that humidity on the East Coast.
1762638	1765020	That's the first thing you'll notice when you visit the East Coast, humidity.
1765400	1766340	At least for me.
1766660	1767001	Okay.
1767041	1768982	You step on the plane and you go, Sheesh!
1769782	1770162	Yeah.
1770583	1773845	Well, just like I'm sure when people from the East Coast come to here, they go, Sheesh!
1775205	1776446	What's wrong with you people?
1776586	1777867	How can you live here?
1778287	1779148	I can't breathe!
1779228	1783710	I think for most it's a relief, but I mean... And the people from the Midwest just go, Sheesh, anyways.
1784491	1784871	Anyway...
1786343	1791786	But yeah, today I've just, I don't know, I was bored and slept all day and then got up like, oh, play Katamari a little while more.
1793307	1801831	Yeah, I had to be a dork and even though I already have the Japanese version, I went and bought the English version on Friday just so I could enjoy the King's English humor.
1802491	1806033	And then noticed quite a few changes between the Japanese and American versions.
1806073	1810356	Like, a lot of them just really superficial changes, some of them really dumb, but whatever.
1812497	1812837	But yeah.
1813823	1815184	That was my day and week, I guess.
1815564	1815984	Any other game?
1816884	1817465	Loki, yes.
1818445	1820106	What the hell was up with the manual?
1820426	1822307	I looked at that and I'm like, what the hell is this?
1822667	1827309	Because the screenshots, he made it kind of look like they were painted with watercolors.
1827729	1829250	And I hope that's not what the game looks like.
1830251	1830291	No.
1830311	1830511	Okay.
1832071	1834472	No, that's just the art director's style that he does.
1834512	1838774	Like a lot of the wallpapers and stuff they put up on the Japanese site, they look all weird like that.
1839635	1842016	Some of them don't even look like they really have much to do with the game.
1842651	1846520	And like when he redraws the characters in that style, they look all super goofy and whatever.
1846540	1847683	Yeah.
1847703	1849587	All right.
1851648	1855030	My week and my day, I actually didn't do a whole lot, really.
1855230	1856551	I've been pretty sad this week.
1857352	1862836	Just work, a lot, a lot of work, and because of that, a lot, a lot of napping after work because work kind of drains me a lot.
1862916	1867320	So I didn't really go anywhere exciting or do anything that great.
1868040	1869762	I really wish I had something to share, but I don't.
1869822	1879029	I went to Fry's yesterday, and I was just, you know, I bought the K game there, and I was actually, my friend's monitor just about blew up.
1879611	1884455	Apparently it started shooting out blue sparks when he tried turning it on, which isn't a good thing.
1884955	1886857	So yeah, Loki's going, yeah!
1887578	1889699	But we decided to go look at new monitors.
1889779	1893763	And I kind of want a new monitor now too, although the one I have is really good, I can't complain.
1894483	1896025	I want a flat screen.
1896785	1897526	It was free.
1897906	1899948	I know it was, and that's why I can't complain about it.
1900328	1902289	But I want a flat screen.
1902609	1904009	I want a little black flat screen.
1904069	1904710	I did the same thing.
1904910	1905910	I do have a black flat screen.
1905950	1906450	Exactly.
1906550	1906730	See?
1906750	1907330	It works a lot better.
1907370	1907571	See?
1907871	1908431	You know what I mean.
1908471	1911712	And it'll be less heat because it gets really hot in here during the show sometimes.
1912132	1916454	It'll kill a few of us and that'll cut down on the heat.
1917494	1922996	Yeah, but I just, you know, that would help cut back on the heat and maybe getting a better fan for this behemoth computer down here.
1923276	1924696	I don't know if you can hear my fan.
1924736	1925797	You probably can hear it over the air.
1925837	1926337	Let me see if I can.
1929935	1933680	you can't really hear it over the air but I have a ginormously loud fan
1934198	1937419	So if I could get a better cooling thing in my computer, I bet it would be cooler in here, too.
1937499	1940040	So those are just things I'm thinking about for the future.
1940620	1944161	So anyway, that was pretty much my week and day.
1944261	1946422	Oh, I played DDR when I was at Fry's.
1946582	1948882	They actually had the DDR Extreme set up.
1949222	1952123	Not Extreme 2, but DDR Extreme set up with the two pads.
1952663	1956765	And for soft pads that were taped to the ground, I'm surprised that things held up.
1956805	1960326	I actually did a pretty decent job on the song I was playing, so that was kind of fun.
1963129	1966711	One last hurrah on DDR Extreme before Extreme 2 comes out this week.
1966751	1967311	Which would be what?
1967351	1968211	Is it Tuesday, Wednesday?
1968271	1968831	I'll ask Track.
1969192	1970292	What day is it going to be on the shelves?
1972053	1972493	Wednesday?
1972673	1972853	27th.
1973073	1974894	27th will be on the shelf.
1975854	1976494	That's the ship day.
1976995	1977275	Alright.
1977435	1978555	Oh, Tuesday's the ship day?
1979155	1979656	I have no idea.
1979676	1980516	I'm saying 27th.
1981516	1986018	It'll be probably on shelves the 27th because that's what we have in our system as the street date.
1986438	1987519	Which means when we get it.
1987639	1989499	So that means that's probably when it's going to arrive.
1989999	1990160	27th.
1990720	1991080	Probably the 27th.
1993413	1993753	Sounds good.
1994854	1999455	Although I know it's not going to show up for a lot of stores until Wednesday, so I'll probably just wait until Wednesday.
1999755	2001196	I'm not in any huge rush.
2001296	2007158	I know a lot of people are really excited about DDR Extreme 2 because Konami's really kept a lid on it this time.
2007298	2014201	There's still a lot, a lot of secrets people don't know about this game yet, including what the freaking rest of the songs are outside the licenses.
2014701	2015821	What game?
2015881	2016662	DDR Extreme 2.
2017082	2017382	What game?
2017782	2021023	The dancing game with the arrow smash, like whack-a-mole, but with your feet.
2021043	2022664	It's a cheesy Eurobeat and stuff.
2023320	2025321	I thought you said they were keeping it under wraps that nobody knew about it.
2025401	2025961	Oh, no, no, no.
2026241	2027201	People know about the game.
2027221	2028241	They just don't know anything about it.
2028461	2028781	Shut up.
2030862	2031302	Unlock show?
2032202	2032402	Hmm?
2032582	2033062	Unlock show?
2034803	2039864	I want to do one, but I don't think we've got the setup to do it anymore.
2040064	2047166	I know our mixing board will take my PS2 inputs right there, but I don't know what to do for video.
2047984	2049385	So I don't know if we can do an unlocked show.
2049605	2053768	Because my Commodore 64 monitor got stolen out of the back of my car by some neighborhood brats.
2054288	2059152	So I don't have anything to plug it into unless we can find a little TV somehow.
2060372	2060953	You might have one?
2061473	2063014	We might have to do that then, like Wednesday night.
2063815	2064055	We'll see.
2065843	2066924	To be continued, to be continued.
2066944	2067464	Well, we'll see.
2068064	2068945	I'm still looking for it.
2068965	2073467	I was looking at Best Buy today, but they didn't have any VGA connectors.
2073807	2078810	Because I'm getting one for my Xbox 360 because I need something to be high def.
2078830	2081151	Because I'm not going to have a high def TV.
2081411	2084913	I don't even know how the hell that's going to work because most of the games are in high def anyways.
2084993	2086174	So if it's not in high def...
2086721	2088022	All your TV, what's that going to look like?
2088062	2089243	All messed up?
2089443	2096988	No, I believe the regular Xbox, what it does is that if you want to play your games in widescreen, it will letterbox the games.
2097068	2101371	There's the menu you can go into and change the options, so it'll probably just letterbox your games.
2102612	2103872	So your video games will look like movies.
2103892	2107975	Yeah, but they're all high-res and stuff, and my TV's not going to support that.
2109256	2111578	I'm sure they can filter the graphics down really quickly.
2111598	2115100	Well, anyways, I'm going to get a thing for my monitor, because it'll look pretty.
2115440	2116041	It will look pretty.
2116321	2116601	That way,
2117039	2118040	VGA Monitor Typing of the Dead
2137154	2138035	Oh, good times.
2138396	2139216	Yeah.
2139296	2140257	Space Channel 5 is this week.
2140658	2141639	I miss my Dreamcast.
2141659	2143281	I'm going to get it out and dust it off and play.
2143321	2144542	I didn't have that many games for it.
2144642	2149748	I mean, I just, like, PSO, but I think I had Typing of the Dead and Samba somewhere.
2150008	2150188	Huh?
2151069	2151670	Oh, okay.
2153609	2155190	I'm talking about pirated games.
2156950	2158751	We don't got to keep it a secret.
2158791	2159691	We got Loki on here.
2159911	2163593	Like pirate games like Skies of Arcadia.
2163633	2165193	I have not pirated any games this week.
2165233	2166233	Good job.
2167014	2174336	Seven days without... That means that some chick is going to climb out of his PSP monitor and steal his soul or something.
2175277	2176677	Did you speak like a pirate on Monday?
2177837	2179618	No, because I think that's retarded.
2181789	2182929	Yarr, you be retarded.
2185370	2192012	Um, yeah, I want to get off the Dreamcast and play some Choo Choo Rocket, because that was a game I really sucked at, so maybe I can get good at it now.
2192412	2193112	No, you know what I want to play?
2193132	2202495	I want to play Power Stone, and I want to play... Power Stone was badass, and I want to play, um... Turbo Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.
2203695	2206796	No, there's another Dreamcast game I'm thinking of that I really want to play.
2207196	2207956	Space Channel 5?
2208056	2209277	Soul Calibur.
2209297	2210357	Soul Calibur.
2211175	2211735	No, no, no.
2211875	2214937	The ultimate in Soul Calibur fun is playing with the fishing controller.
2216398	2216898	That's right.
2216918	2218760	I've heard about that, playing with a fishing controller.
2218880	2220080	Because it's analog.
2221902	2225804	And, of course, every time you hit it, you're hitting basically one of the buttons, so it's really fabulous.
2227145	2227445	All right.
2227765	2228125	Good times.
2228145	2228926	Sounds rather athletic.
2229966	2235910	If you want to know what playing the Nintendo Revolution is going to be like, try playing Soul Calibur with a fishing controller.
2237371	2239172	Remind me to save that one for the podcast.
2240996	2245301	I've been doing that for a long time, the fishing controller thing.
2245621	2252508	I remember trying to play Soul Calibur with my Dreamcast DDR pad, and the only analog button is the Konami logo.
2254390	2254710	Wow.
2254851	2255571	So you can't really move.
2257563	2262585	I remember, I don't remember whose house we did this at, it was either Iguana Girls House or your house.
2262625	2263905	We did Project Justice, yeah.
2264045	2268587	But we played Bust a Move Groove on Dance Pads once.
2268627	2269127	I've done that.
2269507	2270007	It was fun.
2270347	2272548	The second one, you can do it really easily on.
2272908	2275389	Damn them for not making another game.
2275489	2280851	All you do is put it in whatever the easy one was, which is all arrows, and you can play it.
2281571	2282831	Damn them for not making another one.
2306798	2307618	Stop doing the role playing.
2307638	2314661	You know, they just need to put up the whole AVEX side, you know, get AVEX back and do a whole new one.
2314901	2315221	Seriously.
2315521	2317942	You know, a friend of mine once had an interesting perspective.
2318402	2324624	I don't know if you guys know about this, but way back when they beta tested or location tested DDR4th Mix.
2325344	2332767	I don't know if it was location test or an early build of the game or what, but there was actually a song from the Dance Maniacs series, Eyes On Me.
2333570	2362831	and of course that's the theme song from Final Fantasy VIII but it was a dance mix of it that appeared on one of the Dance Maniacs albums I want to say like X5 or something I know there was one on Zipmania but I think it was the version pulled from like X5 or something and Eyes On Me was supposed to be in DDR4th Mix well it got pulled at the last minute and the rumor was that Square took issue with it so they just pulled the song but my friend kind of at the time was like well you know Square probably does that because if they wanted to do
2363661	2364582	Final Revolution
2385802	2392506	And you know, there was actually, because I have this game on Dreamcast, being the big Puyo Puyo nerd I am, I have Puyo Da.
2393387	2394948	I remember you showing that to me once.
2395453	2398856	And there's other style dance games Konami's not going to sue them over.
2398916	2402399	Like, you know, Busta Groove Move and Puyo.
2402859	2407563	Well, Puyo Da was more like Busta Move, except you built up your combos.
2408484	2416611	And it worked sort of how you would do your drop on the other person by having a better combo than they did.
2416871	2419634	And you would cancel out each other's combos, sort of like when you're playing Puyo Puyo.
2420214	2420715	and so on.
2437409	2447253	The second Rival Schools game that they came out with in Japan, which was the Evolution one, had a sort of like Batsu breakdancing in it.
2447973	2449554	Had a DDR sort of mode in it.
2449634	2451654	More like you enter and the commands sort of like bust a move.
2451754	2452735	And Grand Theft Auto had that.
2452955	2454636	And Cardfighter Clash.
2454996	2455736	Not Cardfighter Clash.
2456016	2460178	The other Marvel Capcom... Not Marvel Capcom, um...
2461439	2471091	SNK Capcom on the Neo Geo had pretty much DDR in it.
2472112	2477238	There's an old-ass game, and I only know this game because it was my first DDR game I ever owned.
2477258	2478099	It wasn't really DDR.
2478119	2480242	It was my first dance game I ever owned.
2480635	2484696	It was the Jungle Book dancing game for the PlayStation.
2484996	2485717	I remember that.
2485757	2487497	I remember showing you Third Mix.
2488297	2493399	I remember the dance pad was like half the size of a normal dance pad because they make it for four-year-olds.
2493799	2499621	But here I am playing on this Jungle Book dance pad, and it actually had a whole little game that went with it.
2500121	2504763	The arrows were in little bubbles, and it was very, very similar to DER, except I think it went different.
2505723	2506984	Scroll down, but whatever.
2507464	2509685	But, you know, and all the music was from the Jungle Book.
2509945	2512546	I want to walk like you, talk like you, too.
2513026	2514166	It had all the little music in it.
2514747	2519189	And, like, Lubega had a video in it, and it was a bunch of little kids playing the game.
2519449	2522350	That was my first dance game for PlayStation.
2522870	2525191	And Konami never sued those guys for making that game.
2525211	2527012	Because it had Lubega in it.
2528152	2529593	What's that got to do with anything?
2529633	2530193	Games suck!
2533089	2540334	Yeah, it's actually very interesting because, you know, that's a Disney game, and then Konami actually ended up doing a Disney DDR that was released in America.
2540714	2542435	So, kind of interesting.
2542636	2544977	You know what music game I can't believe they have not made a sequel to?
2545558	2548780	Guitar Room N. I'm kind of surprised, too.
2550261	2551081	It was a great game.
2551502	2552042	They should do it.
2552614	2561265	It was pretty much all one band that did the music and then they had an outside artist come in and do all the graphics and the entire design for the game.
2561285	2564409	So that may be a part of the reason, but I don't know.
2564750	2566692	They should find a new band and a new artist or whatever.
2567574	2567694	Okay.
2568074	2568274	Yeah.
2568695	2568915	Cool.
2570557	2570838	Alright.
2571993	2576416	I guess we're going to go to a break, guys, and we're going to come back and talk about some more things going on in the DDR world.
2577597	2584261	And in this break, we're going to start playing some tracks from the brand new Ultramix 3 VRare, which came out this week.
2584301	2591706	In this break, we're going to hear Neveraka, who originally remixed the Day Behavior song Superstar in Ultramix 2.
2591766	2592786	They have their own song.
2592826	2593847	It's called Evolution.
2594247	2598210	Now, the interesting thing about the Ultramix 3 VRare is that it has tracks from songpacks already.
2599211	2603296	So this first track is actually from Song Pack 14, so go figure.
2603897	2608343	Akira Yamaoka with Love This Feeling has been remixed by Zonk.
2608803	2612147	Zonk was the band that did Tittle Tattle in Ultramix 2, so it's a very...
2613616	2614717	I don't know how to explain it.
2614757	2616098	It's a very kind of groovy version.
2616138	2616818	I love this feeling.
2617018	2629225	But the interesting thing is that, and they've kind of been picking at this on the DDR Freak forums, is that instead of remixing the Chang Ma version, it really sounds like they went back and remixed the Akira Yamaoka one from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.
2629405	2630045	Love this feeling.
2630085	2630786	So that's kind of cool.
2631146	2631906	So it's a good remix.
2632207	2638330	And then we're going to hear Togo featuring Sana with Jelly Kiss, but it's Midihead's version, the Midihead Smack Mix remix.
2638590	2643180	and then the last track we're going to hear this break is Shontanix with Hash the Sun.
2643802	2645666	Brand new song we're going to have in DDR Ultimix 3.
2646147	2648913	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
2649113	2649354	Enjoy.
2679579	2680360	Thanks for watching!
2748957	2750106	Thank you for watching!
2778784	2779347	and the others.
2853750	2880331	Ah, he's my boy, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the
2931185	2932187	Thank you for watching
3042269	3042991	Thanks for watching!
3080367	3086228	Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
3088868	3091929	You know what else Captain Jack told me?
3092069	3093489	Copy kills music.
3093969	3094269	It does.
3095309	3096990	You're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
3097050	3098870	Tonight we're giving away free stuff.
3099602	3101803	The drawing's only probably about an hour away.
3102163	3103624	So make sure you get your emails in.
3103744	3105865	Freestuff at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3105885	3110007	And to answer some questions from before, you don't have to put your address in the email.
3110027	3112268	But if you put it in there, we're not going to disqualify you or anything.
3112548	3115049	But if you send us two emails, you are going to get disqualified.
3115429	3116550	So send those in.
3116610	3118071	Freestuff at OrangeLawnTrader.com.
3118111	3120032	And what is the free stuff we're giving away tonight?
3120412	3127215	Well, if you win, and we'll have one listener during the live show tonight, and one winner sometime this week after the podcast,
3127535	3138418	You are going to win a pair of CDs, one of them being the DDR Max II V-Rare, which is kind of hard to find now, and the DDR EX II V-Rare, which if you didn't pre-order the game, you ain't going to get anywhere else.
3138818	3140838	So we're going to hook you up with those.
3140918	3152701	So if you want to copy authentic copies, sealed copies of DDR Max II and DDR EX II, and who knows, we might just, because we're loving and caring hosts, we might throw something else in the bag too.
3153339	3163762	But the one thing we will not be throwing in the bag will be a copy of In The Groove as defaced by Loki, DarkSakura, and I will be a lot more forgiving for In The Groove.
3164222	3167323	I'm not going to deface it, but I will definitely do my part.
3167883	3169663	You're not going to throw $5 bills in with the viewers?
3170544	3171264	No, no money.
3171544	3171924	No money.
3172144	3173344	Because I don't have money.
3173644	3177785	And I don't know about DarkSakura and Loki, but even if I had money, I wouldn't give it to our listeners.
3178286	3178706	No offense.
3178866	3179766	Love you guys, but damn.
3180939	3185281	DarkSakura, I know you weren't too thrilled with a couple of those.
3185321	3188683	That version, I love that feeling, was crap disguised as a song.
3208058	3208779	You know what's interesting?
3209179	3211382	Very polarized reaction on DDR Freak.
3211422	3213624	I was reading on the forums over there, very polarized reaction.
3213664	3217108	Some people love it, and some people just think it is poop.
3218009	3219830	And also I don't like that version of Jelly Kiss either.
3220371	3221973	Oh, I really like the Jelly Kiss ones.
3222393	3224575	I'm not that big on the love this feeling mix.
3224736	3227619	I like Zonk, but... And the first one was very generic.
3228039	3230722	Like, photocopy generic.
3231525	3232686	The ferret is being requested.
3233026	3234287	The ferret is being requested?
3234427	3235608	The ferret is being requested.
3235768	3238791	We'll get out the ferret and take care of that request.
3239812	3240632	Where is the ferret?
3241553	3242974	I think the ferret's went off to breed.
3244295	3244896	Probably.
3245416	3246437	It was around here somewhere.
3247277	3250140	We'll look for the ferret and try to get the ferret in on the show a little later.
3252141	3255444	Hell if I know where those things went off to.
3255784	3258847	We'll keep looking for it during the next break and try to get an appearance by the ferret.
3259287	3260528	Oh, you know what reminds me, though?
3261235	3262196	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
3280640	3286264	The weird thing is that there's a site out there that links to us as a news source.
3286284	3290286	They have all these RSS feeds, and we're one of them as a news source.
3291207	3293929	The site is ferretmarketing.com.
3293949	3296990	It has us as a news source.
3297731	3299972	If you guys don't believe me, look at this right here in studio.
3299992	3301533	In fact, I'll even post this in chat.
3301914	3303975	This poor site's going to get hammered, but I don't care.
3304435	3305816	I'm going to post this in chat.
3307179	3307679	Check us out.
3307779	3308680	Ferret Marketing.
3308920	3309460	And here we are.
3309540	3314082	Here's the URL for the awesome new source, OrangeLaunchRadio.com, and it shows our latest headlines.
3314922	3318464	Why we are on FerretMarketing.com, I have no idea.
3318584	3319644	Because you mentioned ferrets.
3319685	3321765	There's a ferret fan that's listening to this show.
3322626	3324006	Those are pretty damn cute ferrets.
3324567	3326087	They are cute ferrets that are on the page.
3326307	3328548	I have no idea what the... I know.
3328668	3329289	We'll look for it.
3329489	3329769	It might...
3331198	3333719	There's probably some in a box over there, so I'll dig through them on the next break.
3334800	3339142	Anyway, Loki's currently defacing the copy of In the Groove that we're going to give away.
3339622	3340082	I'm helping.
3340302	3340763	What have you done?
3340903	3343024	I assure you... Wait, what did you write on the manual here?
3343824	3346325	I assure you this is not DDR, okay?
3347646	3348706	What did you write on the cover there?
3348806	3351567	I want to see what Loki wrote on the cover there, of In the Groove there.
3352108	3354989	This game sucks monkey balls, and then signed it by Loki.
3355009	3355749	That was very polite.
3355769	3357170	All right, good job.
3357611	3359892	I found a book called 500 Things My Ferret Told Me.
3361813	3362293	Let me guess.
3371357	3377039	And if you are an In The Groove fan listening to this program and getting pissed off, it's just a game.
3377259	3378039	It's just a game, people.
3378419	3378860	It's just a game.
3379140	3379980	We have the right to our opinion.
3380600	3381621	I don't think it sucks.
3382523	3385766	But I do, I look forward to new DDR mixes more than I do in a game.
3385926	3388809	I had people go, why are you ruining such a perfect, that's stupid.
3388849	3390611	I'm like, because I can.
3392373	3394755	Exactly, so if you... If I was given a free iPod...
3395680	3400182	I'd probably break it, but then if I didn't break it, I would give it away and do the exact same thing.
3400322	3407025	Okay, so if you're wondering why are you bastards writing all over a copy of In the Groove and giving it away.
3407045	3412208	I personally bought this copy, okay, so my money was spent on this copy that I am sending out.
3412248	3422053	Yes, so if it makes you feel better, In the Groove fans, Loki spent money, so he's essentially supporting In the Groove, but because he doesn't like it, he's turning it over to an In the Groove fan.
3422353	3423933	And what better charity than that, huh?
3424274	3424914	So stop bitching.
3427679	3429822	We will get some pics of the DeFesta in the groove.
3430182	3433526	Probably not by the end of the show, but a little later on in the program.
3434026	3435768	A little later on in the week.
3438351	3439773	What were the ferrets called, Lokis?
3439853	3440734	One of our chatters, I think.
3440754	3441775	Scoozies.
3442116	3443878	But I don't remember exactly how it's spelled.
3443898	3444579	It's like S-C-O-O-Z-I-E-S.
3447967	3449308	I came up with something completely different.
3449709	3450209	I can hold on.
3450229	3450730	I can find it.
3450770	3453393	They have a whole website and a mini web game they can play.
3453613	3454694	Was it adult oriented?
3454714	3458898	Because I bet scoozies would be a pretty X-rated term for some genitalia if you think about it.
3462381	3463423	Show them your scoozie.
3463443	3466886	You mean, what was it?
3467066	3467987	S-C-Z-Y?
3469288	3469649	Scuzzy.
3470389	3471631	No, scuzzy is a little different there.
3473555	3474275	Um, let's see.
3474455	3475976	So moving on, I want to talk about some other things.
3475996	3484998	Some things that people were talking about before the show, and I actually can't say I'm really up to date on what's going on here, so I'm hoping somebody might call in the skyplane later and clear up the air on what's going on.
3486138	3489799	But I guess there's going to be some type of DDR thing on MTV.
3490939	3492500	Not just any MTV, but MTV2.
3494778	3496999	MTV2, of course.
3497239	3506124	I remember when MTV2 first launched, it was supposed to be, oh, since MTV, we're freely admitting, is not a music-oriented station anymore, MTV2 is where we're going to play all the videos.
3506504	3508125	It's where MTV goes to die.
3508405	3508785	Basically.
3508825	3509325	But guess what?
3509405	3511807	Now, on MTV2, they don't just play videos anymore.
3511827	3512507	They play other crap.
3512547	3515008	They play old episodes of real world stuff.
3515428	3515608	So...
3517690	3527853	One of our listeners, Sephiroth1215, on our web forums actually wrote, I was randomly watching that video mod show yesterday, and they showed a preview for the new episode that will be on Friday.
3528393	3531914	This preview mentioned DDR being featured for a video.
3532574	3533854	I think it's about time they did this.
3533934	3535015	It only seems to make sense.
3535115	3537115	Perfect for the time for the new release, I guess.
3538055	3539656	Other than in everything but the girl video?
3540236	3544137	Yeah, if you actually have seen, if you played 2DX3rdStyle,
3545524	3554830	and played Five Fathoms, you can actually see an old-ass version of DDR, like butterfly old-ass version of DDR in the video.
3554950	3558572	And you can see a five key, like they're playing Jam Jam Reggae in the video or something.
3559033	3560033	So it's kind of cute.
3564656	3565377	What do you guys think?
3566357	3570280	MTV going to be on, or DDR going to be on MTV?
3571161	3573342	Good thing for the community, bad thing for the community.
3573582	3574302	I don't give a shit.
3574342	3574963	What do you think?
3574983	3577804	That means DDR has jumped the shark.
3577924	3579244	DDR has officially jumped the shark?
3579744	3581565	So, does this mean you're an In the Groove fan now?
3582346	3582906	Fuck no.
3583926	3587247	Okay, if the original has jumped the shark, why would I go for a pale imitation?
3589688	3590449	How about Dance Praise?
3590489	3591209	Does that jump the shark?
3593010	3593870	It is the shark.
3595111	3595471	Bugged.
3596571	3597992	Your thoughts, DDR on MTV.
3598052	3599472	Good thing, bad thing, I don't give a shit.
3599773	3600393	Don't give a shit.
3601469	3602690	It's on MTV2.
3602730	3604251	I don't even get MTV fucking 2.
3606892	3608893	Garrett, a pop music whore.
3609333	3610294	DDR on MTV.
3610354	3611074	Don't give a shit.
3615516	3616697	I guess it's a good thing.
3616817	3617557	I think it's a good thing.
3618358	3623800	More exposure for DDR, despite how we might think MTV2 is just stupid.
3625241	3630844	More exposure for DDR means more copies of the game get sold, means we get an EX3 next year, right?
3633728	3634530	I say it's a good thing.
3634971	3638518	Any exposure is a good thing if more people buy copies of it.
3640672	3644874	Somebody in the chat room is saying, I would love to see In the Groove on MTV.
3645254	3652937	And I have to say, when I was at E3, we were actually downstairs in Kensho Hall, where Red Octane had a booth, and they had In the Groove set up.
3652957	3656259	They didn't have it even set up the first day, but I think this was the last day of the show.
3657339	3665803	Myself, and I don't know if you guys remember from the old Wednesday show, Rice, Princess, and Lanky Style, we were down there in Kensho Hall, and...
3667000	3672603	We were at the In The Groove showing and MTV came by and filmed this guy very randomly playing.
3672643	3674965	Thank you for pulling out my Dreamcast out of a box.
3676546	3680348	MTV came by and was very randomly filming somebody playing In The Groove.
3680648	3683910	But it was for like an MTV.com series.
3684270	3690114	But what I thought was interesting is that one of the hosts was Chi-Lon Liu and then some guy from Road Rules.
3690134	3690694	But Chi-Lon...
3691317	3704570	was, um, you remember right before the screensavers went kaput and changed into Attack of the Show, they had Qi Lan on there, and she was kind of, uh, now, if you really want to see, if you want to really see what a giggling girl is, it's Qi Lan.
3705311	3713679	I mean, and, you know, I know that sometimes that phrase is overused, but in her case, it really was true.
3714419	3715961	Um, so...
3717697	3720623	But she's still doing things for MTV, it looks like.
3722407	3722848	Interesting.
3723910	3724972	So they were doing In the Groove.
3725373	3727858	So in some way it would have been on MTV, I suppose.
3729733	3732375	So of course, EX2 is coming out this week.
3732435	3733716	I'm curious what you guys think.
3733796	3736677	Are you guys ready to pick this game up, or do you not care?
3737258	3739439	Are you done with DDR home mixes?
3739959	3740480	What do you think?
3741060	3745863	I'm curious to hear from you, Garrett, because you are mostly an import gaming horn.
3745883	3748505	You don't buy a whole lot of the US games, do you?
3748525	3749585	I don't think you really do.
3749685	3753508	Not as many as I... Well, actually, I don't buy a whole lot of games, period, anymore.
3754008	3758391	I don't know what it is, but I lost interest of the US DDRs after...
3759281	3762323	Max 1 or 2, you know, for the US.
3762843	3771309	It's just a song that's just regurgitated from, you know, okay, random transplants with crappy steps or songs that I already had in other versions.
3771349	3772470	I'm like, no, it's kind of pointless.
3772810	3776973	And, like, Ultramix stuff looked interesting, but I don't care to get an Xbox.
3777653	3779835	So, there's my feelings on that.
3780455	3782317	So, you're probably not going to buy EX2?
3782937	3785339	No, the down arrow on my red octane pad is broken.
3785519	3785739	Dope.
3787423	3787723	All right.
3788644	3791285	Loki, I'm kind of curious, what are your thoughts about EX2?
3791425	3793246	I'm probably getting it free, so I don't care.
3794146	3795187	But are you excited about it?
3795247	3795927	Could you care less?
3796147	3796487	What is it?
3796807	3804671	I don't really have working pads, so, I mean, well, I have working pads, I just haven't, you know, gotten them so that they're not, you know, breaking all the time.
3805111	3807773	But, yeah, I guess it's cool.
3807953	3812595	I mean, I don't play DDR really right now, other than, you know, just Step Mania stuff.
3813435	3816837	I'm really, the setup that I have in the house right now is not conducive to DDR.
3817304	3819446	So, unfortunately.
3820547	3821288	But yeah, it's cool.
3821588	3823811	I mean, I can't wait to see what else they've got on there.
3824251	3826553	Like all the new songs and remixes and fun stuff.
3827815	3831158	And thank God they haven't spoiled it yet, so it'll be good.
3833200	3835062	I didn't like the fact that they had hints last time, so.
3836854	3847417	DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts about EX2, because you started DDR way back in the day, so you've seen this game really change, as have really all of us, but I know you've been on board for a long time.
3848057	3856419	I think I'm going to get it, just because I'm also planning on finally throwing down a little bit of money and getting an ignition pad, because I want to play at home some more.
3857459	3864101	But other than that, I'm not too excited about it, and the music isn't all that exciting anymore.
3865940	3871883	If I get something other than recycled, puked trance, it's the only way I can describe it.
3872563	3878026	Someone took generic trance, put it on a photocopier, and said, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song.
3878806	3884229	I want a DDR with good music, with real music in it.
3885089	3893093	I love all the Konami originals, all those are great, but if they're going to bring in something new, bring in something innovative.
3893453	3894573	Throw us a freaking bone here.
3894613	3895233	What kind of stuff?
3895353	3896614	What kind of music would make you happy?
3896954	3897274	Blur.
3897634	3898974	I mean it.
3899114	3899635	Oh, I see.
3900255	3901855	You want feel-good ink in DDR.
3902615	3903275	That's not blur.
3903295	3903836	That's gorillas.
3904336	3905116	Well, I know, but still.
3905776	3908697	But I do want something that's got more substance to it.
3909077	3918179	Something other than the, you know, just... Not all music you can dance to is the techno-y stuff.
3918559	3926441	Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Unleashed and Dancing Stage games, the Europe ones that have the British Britpop songs in them and stuff?
3926721	3927541	That makes me happy.
3928661	3940083	I mean, I don't really care about the Uberpop, but just that it seems like it's trying to cater more toward a broader scope of music, I think.
3940103	3940663	Trying to...
3944929	3946651	I need to just make my own DDR mix.
3950469	3961098	In America, even if you're a fan of the American DDRs, even if you're a fan of the Japanese home DDR mixes, almost everybody agrees that the British folks get really good songs.
3961518	3962539	They get really good mixes.
3962579	3973768	There's actually an interesting thread on DDR Freak, because I mod the UK forum, saying, you know, I sort of like talking about which one would you more prefer.
3973948	3975650	There's been a discussion in this one thread.
3976450	3993125	I'll try to hunt it down and get more info out of it but it was really kind of interesting seeing who would want what out of what mix and seeing that there was sort of on the other side that they want some of what we get but I don't see why.
3994921	3996543	Some of what we get is kind of cool, though.
3997904	4003929	I honestly thought that the last release was so much better, you know, with Skulk and all that.
4003969	4004570	Oh, Ultramix 2?
4004650	4004970	Ultramix 2.
4005130	4007232	Oh, and I think Ultramix 3 is going to be pretty good, too.
4007252	4015400	I mean, I know you didn't like those particular songs, but if you remember the Ultramix 1 VRare, it didn't have a whole lot of what the game really had in store, so we'll see.
4015720	4019182	But I haven't heard anything that's excited me yet.
4019222	4025924	In fact, just what we played in the break, the last break, really made me sad.
4026205	4028065	Well, we're about to get to another break pretty soon here.
4028085	4029326	We're going to hear four more songs.
4029446	4030786	One of them is a classical remix.
4030867	4032227	I don't know if you'll dig that or not.
4032267	4032607	We'll see.
4033127	4034168	We're going to get to that.
4034188	4035709	In fact, I think we'll get to it right now.
4035989	4036449	How's that sound?
4036649	4036989	Yay!
4037129	4037369	All right.
4037389	4039030	Then when we come back, we're going to do the Skype line.
4040471	4043552	Siggy's going to call in and he's going to talk about...
4043932	4048353	A brand new Konami-related CD that came out this week, so we're going to talk about that.
4048973	4050233	And at least I think it was this week.
4050914	4051234	I think so.
4052314	4053474	If not, he'll correct me on it, I'm sure.
4054974	4056255	And some more stuff when we come back.
4056275	4059055	We'll do the Cage Match sometime during this next segment as well.
4059535	4062656	And the rest of your calls on the Skype line when we come back after this.
4063196	4066777	So in this break, let's see what songs we're going to hear here.
4067997	4070598	We're going to do, starting it off...
4071651	4077815	Mo-Shik with Moment 40 will be the first song that we hear, and I believe this is the one that's a bit of a classical song remix, so we'll hear that.
4078695	4083518	DJ Taka, Colors, but remixed by Midihead, so that should be interesting.
4084338	4090202	John D. and Spesh have done a version of By La Lakia, Carried With The Wind, and it's very interesting.
4090222	4096625	You might remember John D. and Spesh did the Max 300 remix from Ultramix 2, so that'll definitely be very interesting to hear.
4097066	4100988	And then we're going to hear Big Idea with Danza De Yucca.
4101508	4108252	Big Idea is the one that did Baile La Samba and ToeJam, which made its way into 2DX.
4108332	4108832	Happy Sky.
4108852	4111133	I can't think of ToeJam without thinking of ToeJam and Earl.
4111533	4111853	I know.
4111913	4112514	Yeah, me neither.
4112954	4116476	It's just because you're a Sega whore, and so are you, and that's okay, because Sega's a good thing.
4117176	4120158	I can reach behind me and pull Segas out of your closet.
4120198	4120918	I know, I know.
4121338	4122759	I keep all my Segas in the closet.
4123559	4125020	They're trapped in the closet.
4126381	4127221	We'll be back after this.
4127261	4128462	Start it off with Moshik, Moment 40.
4129202	4131661	Ultramix 3 VRare here tonight on Orange Lingerie.
4234944	4236585	Thank you for watching!
4385202	4386387	Thank you for watching!
4572133	4572993	Oop, dead air there.
4573093	4573594	Sorry guys.
4573874	4579557	We forgot to put a little, I should say I forgot to put a little sweeper coming back.
4579637	4583919	So I was too busy doing my own spin on defacing the copy of In the Groove here.
4584659	4586600	I'm actually writing in the table of contents right now.
4586660	4590182	I actually added something to the table of contents in the instruction manual.
4590202	4592463	I put how to get sued on page 69.
4593303	4593803	How to get sued.
4594143	4595384	And now I'm putting contents.
4595424	4596465	I'm writing next to contents.
4596805	4599166	Contents of my ass.
4599186	4601327	I'm going to put contents of my ass.
4601721	4604480	I'm putting special, really crappy artwork in the inside cover.
4605717	4610019	So again, this is us defacing in the groove because we can.
4610979	4616682	And to whoever wins this, DarkSakura is leaving a very special message and some artwork in there.
4617702	4623305	Inside the art, like you would have to pull out the insert to see it on the inside.
4623705	4625466	So whoever wins this is really going to enjoy this.
4625906	4627887	Speaking of winning things... Here, Loki, I don't want this anymore.
4628527	4633029	Speaking of winning things, you this week... Yeah, you guys need to sign it too.
4633209	4634350	We're also going to have Bugged and...
4634971	4636865	Garrett, our Papa Music Corps, leave their mark on it.
4639332	4640133	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4665015	4666616	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4699304	4703047	And just so you know, we're not all in the groove haters.
4703167	4705229	I realize DarkSakura and Loki are in the groove haters.
4705409	4711634	I actually wrote my defacing, the other thing I did, I wrote on the title, it says in the groove, I put, is okay.
4712274	4714316	And then I drew a little unemotional face.
4714496	4715777	So I put, in the groove is okay.
4716878	4718339	Because that's how I feel, in the groove is okay.
4718359	4719940	Okay.
4723021	4723441	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
4744262	4745443	Neil, you're a bastard.
4745483	4745923	I hate you.
4746423	4746703	All right.
4747543	4748284	I'm just too quick.
4748324	4748664	I'm sorry.
4748704	4752205	No, I intentionally am bringing this call to the front because I want to speak to this person.
4752245	4752925	Siggy, you there?
4755166	4755646	Oh, shit.
4755686	4756347	Siggy, you there?
4757607	4758207	Can you hear me?
4758948	4759528	I didn't do it.
4759608	4760568	Yes, slow.
4761048	4762389	Okay, it's very slow.
4762489	4764410	Oh, that stinks.
4765390	4765710	I know.
4766270	4767811	Siggy, I'm going to try calling you.
4767831	4768551	I'm going to call again.
4768791	4770132	Okay, I'm going to call you.
4770970	4772711	I hope he heard that, that I'm going to call him.
4773092	4774052	See if we have a little better luck.
4774553	4776574	I need to turn off my pornography torrents.
4778776	4780137	That is an annoying ass ring.
4783579	4784240	Two ringing dings.
4784400	4791165	The rest of you guys that are trying to call in right now, call back in a little bit, because we wanted to bring this call to the front, because he actually has a contribution to make to tonight's show.
4792546	4796589	Not that the rest of you don't have contributions to make to tonight's show, but this is, you know, super important.
4797690	4798330	Well, shit!
4799071	4800352	It's just ringing and ringing and ringing.
4802651	4809555	Okay, Siggy's gonna actually just restart his PC, so we're gonna let him restart his PC and we'll take another call in the meantime.
4812236	4812797	Zaku.
4813697	4814397	What's up, man?
4814517	4815318	You lucked out.
4815598	4820801	The other call, I had to drop it and push it back to later because the connection's slow, so you get to be first tonight.
4821607	4822288	Wee!
4822608	4823329	What's on your mind?
4824110	4825352	Well, uh, let me see.
4825372	4828956	DDR Extreme 2 coming out in two days, and... Did you enter the contest?
4830558	4832280	Uh, yeah, I entered the VRare one.
4832380	4832701	Good man.
4834035	4838997	and basically MTV2 whoring the shit out of DDR Extreme 2 via video mods.
4839197	4840718	Yo, what is this video mod show now?
4840738	4842519	I don't watch MTV2, so you gotta tell me.
4843019	4852424	Basically, video mods is a show, is an MTV2 show where they take video game characters and make them reenact music videos, you know, from Main Street Music.
4852744	4855285	Oh, fuck, it's that show that's gonna have DDR?
4855825	4859166	Yeah, the only one I've ever seen of that is The Sims dancing to Hey Yah.
4859206	4875393	Yes, and my best bet is that they're gonna make, you know, they're gonna make all, you know, all the DDR2 characters dance to Sean Paul's Get Busy, which is the only mainstream track that, you know, Joe Sixpack probably knows, and, you know, probably the rest of America knows.
4876573	4881515	Who else in America would know about My My My or Silence, for that matter?
4882487	4888652	Now, Silence I could see, but what I remember from the Silence video, it wasn't really anything all that.
4888692	4890074	So I could see the Get Busy video.
4890774	4891875	It's going to be Get Busy.
4893156	4895218	I'm betting everything on it, without a shadow of a doubt.
4895278	4896479	You know how MTV is.
4896979	4898541	Well, it could be something from Extreme 1.
4899725	4900765	No, they're going to use Xtreme 2.
4902046	4905807	I can tell you right now, that's the most recent game.
4906167	4907167	MTV's not stupid.
4907187	4908408	They're going to whore out the game.
4909608	4916470	We'll just have to wait until Friday to see MTV.
4916490	4917831	You want to make some money on that, Wager?
4919171	4920072	I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.
4921133	4931502	Well, you know, I am going to have an extra Max 2 VRare after these contests, so maybe I should offer to send Zaku the Max 2 VRare if I'm wrong.
4931982	4933183	Nah, that would be too nice of me to do.
4933263	4933664	Sorry, Zaku.
4935899	4947464	Also, you already know by now that the Ultramix 3 V-Ray revealed a few songs that might be in the game, like 250 BPM, Looney Tunes, in the medley.
4947784	4951906	The medley that's at the end, that has a bunch of remixes of songs that are going to be in songpacks?
4952326	4955627	Yes, it possibly does reveal songs that will be in the game.
4956088	4960149	Again, it's not for sure, but typically, songpacks every mix.
4961850	4971780	This is kind of like retribution for the fact that Info was leaked last year with Ultramix 2, so I guess Konami's trying to sneak in a few hints for those who know enough to realize them.
4972720	4973321	Possibly.
4973461	4978005	I honestly think Love Me Do is a shoo-in, because the folks at Konami know
4981294	4985177	that we are a big Akira Yamaoka whores and all his songs do very well in the DDR games.
4985498	4988840	So he has to have something in Extreme.
4989261	4993244	The question is, do the higher-ups of Konami really listen to the station?
4994325	4998889	Besides people who work as beta testers slash step-makers.
4999870	5001111	I mean, the ones above them.
5001511	5007456	Are they the ones listening and trying to reflect and pretty much take DDR into that form?
5007797	5008077	Mm-hmm.
5009400	5009701	Hmm.
5010865	5012429	Well, alright.
5012690	5014155	Anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?
5015381	5018143	GameStop and the other places are still showing Beatmania U.S.
5018183	5033334	as November 1st as a release date I can tell you that's a load of crap I assure you it will not be November 1st I'm saying the same thing too right now I don't know why they can't get it to their Who needs to be schooled on this, Zaku?
5034755	5040820	EB EB Games needs to be schooled EB Games needs to be schooled on the release date of Beatmania U.S.A.
5041340	5042501	They need to push it by a few months.
5042521	5043521	It's not coming out this year.
5043541	5046984	They need to push it four more months.
5047564	5053368	EB Games Management, if you're listening, EB Games Management, update your damn systems.
5053388	5055109	That game will not be out this year, I guarantee it.
5057070	5060132	Ultramix and what was it?
5060372	5068938	Ultramix, DDR EX3, or EX3, EX2 will be out this year, and the Karaoke Party is going to be out before the year's out, right?
5068978	5070079	Karaoke Party got one week.
5071158	5071738	That's my big deal.
5073339	5074920	Karaoke Party will definitely be out this year.
5075020	5078882	Those will be Konami's big pushes for Christmas, and then next year they can start it on their own again.
5078902	5081704	Plus, with your Extreme 2, you know, you get to play Karaoke Party, a demo.
5082919	5083259	That's true.
5083339	5084100	Oh, really?
5085460	5086220	No one told me this.
5086261	5086521	All right.
5086721	5086961	All right.
5087181	5089502	And that's, yeah, that's pretty much about it.
5090002	5093764	Digital Life Expo next month, October 14th through 16th.
5093944	5095484	Don't remind me because I can't go.
5096005	5096685	I can't go.
5097125	5110631	I know that, but I'm just plugging the damn thing because, you know, there's people on the East Coast that would want to go, so I might as well plug it and just, you know, tell them the date.
5111138	5111738	They don't forget it.
5112079	5116182	I didn't notice that because, you know, as I said, I'm like 30 miles away in college.
5116202	5117723	I'm 30 miles from the city.
5117783	5120605	I'm 30 miles north of the city.
5120625	5122046	Nothing a train won't get you to.
5137072	5140715	Yeah, because, you know, I'm still waiting for that first paycheck for my new job.
5140895	5141515	Alright, alright.
5142416	5143317	So, that's it.
5143777	5144617	Well, maybe he'll be back.
5145918	5146939	Alright, alright.
5147780	5148440	Alright, Zaku.
5149021	5150322	I'm letting you go so we can take other calls.
5151242	5151602	Alright, man.
5151642	5152143	Have a good one.
5152663	5152963	Peace.
5153063	5153424	Take care.
5154885	5155205	Alright.
5157261	5158261	We're going to go to another call.
5158361	5169966	I apologize to those of you guys that are also trying to get in, but I definitely, definitely want to get Siggy in here because he was kind enough to get us some previews of a brand new Konami artist-related album that was out this week.
5170006	5171987	So I want to make sure he can get in here.
5174188	5175549	And we're just going to wait for him to call.
5176589	5178190	Then we'll get to some more calls on the Skype line.
5178230	5184132	Remember, if you want to call us on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.
5184232	5185053	Now let's try this again.
5185113	5185693	Siggy, you there?
5186738	5187639	Yep, I'm here, Sky.
5187739	5188319	Much better.
5188379	5189140	How you doing, my friend?
5189901	5190661	I'm doing fine.
5191002	5192043	Can we hear him in studio okay?
5192703	5192863	Good?
5193123	5193324	Yeah.
5193424	5193764	Okay, good.
5194685	5198448	Siggy, now, I've been kind of keeping it a secret, because I know you wanted to talk about it.
5198568	5199509	What are we going to hear?
5199529	5201270	What are you going to let our listeners hear tonight?
5202131	5209077	As of September 16, 2005, Guitar Freak's drum mania artist, Asaki, released his debut album, Shinkoku.
5209978	5210358	Cool.
5211920	5212400	So, uh...
5213252	5222417	There are actually four new original tracks by ASAKI, and the six of them are from Bimondi games like Guitar Fixed Drift Mania and Pop It Music.
5223057	5229540	So we're going to play track number two, which is the first original song by ASAKI.
5230020	5234963	It's a mid-tempo song with very heavy guitar riffs and such.
5235763	5237744	So here's Firefly Hotaru.
5238516	5240017	We're just going to be playing clips of these songs, too.
5240037	5240838	We're not going to play the whole thing.
5240858	5241598	Is there like six minute long songs?
5241618	5242559	Just a minute long clips, yeah.
5242579	5243119	All right, here we go.
5243179	5245761	This is track two, one of the brand new Asaki songs.
5246801	5249203	Asaki songs
5273668	5274908	Now see, I dug that one.
5274948	5276629	That should have been on the Ultramix 3 VRare.
5277329	5279270	Wouldn't that be cool to have a song like that on Ultramix 3?
5279950	5280430	We'll see.
5280550	5280910	Yeah.
5281670	5283731	Alright, what else are we going to hear?
5283771	5285091	Even though I don't play Xbox, yeah.
5286052	5286392	I think so.
5286412	5287292	Still, it would be a good thing.
5287312	5287772	Okay, then fine.
5287832	5288612	EX2, whatever.
5289553	5289853	Alright.
5291312	5297453	The second track, which is another track in the Asagi original, is a very soft piano ballad.
5298574	5301954	It's a very... How should I say it?
5303695	5304855	Very slow, very soft.
5304935	5307936	So here's the sound it conveys in Yogo no Oto.
5309516	5310736	Alright, here's... Track 5.
5310816	5311696	Yes, that's track 5.
5311736	5313137	I was looking for it.
5313177	5313577	Here it is.
5313937	5314557	Piano ballad.
5316277	5317558	Piano ballad.
5323872	5328914	Now that would not be a good song for DDR.
5351803	5352684	Definitely not.
5352904	5353204	Okay.
5353704	5356746	Maybe Keyboard Mania, like a one-face song on Keyboard Mania.
5356806	5358126	All right, what else are we going to hear?
5358467	5358767	Yeah.
5358887	5366631	The third track is Track 9, a third new Asahi original, which is kind of like taking a page out of Tsuminagara Toka no Juwaifu.
5367071	5374915	And this is The Divine Comedy, which is a popular poem written by Dante Algieri, a.k.a.
5374955	5375795	Dante's Inferno.
5375855	5376616	So here it is.
5376636	5378977	And this is where the album gets its name.
5379097	5379857	This is the title track.
5379877	5379957	Yep.
5380178	5380398	All right.
5380658	5380798	Yep.
5385612	5386573	Thank you for watching!
5429451	5430152	That's pretty cool.
5430312	5430772	I like that.
5430832	5431913	Very diverse.
5431933	5436777	This seems like it would be a good just kind of chill out music playing in the background while you're trying to study or something.
5436797	5437237	This is good.
5437277	5437658	I like this.
5438739	5443863	That last one makes me think sort of post-Gogged Malasmizer.
5444303	5444704	A little bit.
5444724	5445164	A little bit.
5445604	5450528	Again, if you're just joining us, we're listening to tracks from the brand new Masaki album, which was just released this week.
5451389	5452030	Siggy's with us.
5452310	5453711	And what else are we going to hear tonight, Siggy?
5454477	5459740	Oh, I just forgot to mention that track 9 was the longest Asahi song, which is about 9 minutes long.
5459880	5461621	That was a behemoth of a song, yes it was.
5461902	5466504	But I would expect any song that's going to have Dante's Inferno is going to be kind of long.
5467365	5469206	Okay, what else are we going to hear?
5469226	5476170	And this one's the last track, the last Asahi original, which is the most ordinary Asahi song that I've ever heard.
5476430	5479872	It's With Bubble in the Clear Sky, Sorasumi no Hiyodorito.
5480393	5480733	All right.
5534009	5535531	All right, very cool, very cool.
5535571	5543057	Now let's hear, you know, for those folks that may not recognize Sasaki too much, what's one of these songs that was actually in a previous Pomani game?
5544717	5555781	The very first Asahi song that he ever, that the Bimani series he got released was Tanagi from Guitar Fixed Romania 7th mix, 6th mix.
5556041	5563044	Alright, and yes, this one's in rotation on our station as well, so you've probably heard this song before, but it's a long mix, so here's a little clip of this one.
5563624	5564144	Here we go.
5590297	5593740	All right, those are tracks from the brand new album by Asaki.
5594420	5595141	Shinkioku?
5595401	5595961	Did I say that right?
5596221	5596442	Yeah.
5596642	5596942	Cool.
5596962	5597422	Shinkioku.
5597622	5598183	Shinkioku.
5598323	5599043	Hey, I'm learning.
5599384	5603567	All right, so now if folks want to order this album, how can they pick it up, Siggy?
5604968	5613334	I haven't checked out some online retailers, but I think PlayAshow should be starting their orders.
5614314	5615375	CD Japan too, right?
5617547	5620868	Garrett actually ordered this CD because he was kind of... He may have.
5621288	5624089	He was actually happy to hear these preview tracks because he hasn't gotten this CD yet.
5624149	5625389	So where did you pick this up from?
5627450	5631171	I ordered mine from PlayAsia, but I thought Gali's... I don't know.
5631191	5633332	Did they change the release date on Gali's art book?
5633352	5639494	Because I thought it was supposed to come out on the same day, but it obviously changed, so I'm not getting it until October when Gali's book comes out.
5640014	5640654	So, oh well.
5641114	5641894	I get to listen to it now.
5642275	5643915	Uh-huh.
5644975	5645596	Well, I knew that they...
5647510	5648731	Siggy has a question for you, Garrett.
5649291	5649591	What's that?
5649691	5658336	No, I'm just gonna tell Garrett that the file that I sent to Sky, it has the pictures of the cover, the CD, the lyrics to it.
5659296	5660077	Yeah, I saw those.
5662338	5662758	Ah, okay.
5663174	5663575	I don't blame you.
5679034	5679575	Don't blame you.
5679795	5680336	I appreciate it.
5680356	5681237	There's just too much.
5681277	5682118	It gets overwhelming sometimes.
5682339	5689308	And Garrett really helps fill me in on a lot of that stuff because he can understand a lot of Japanese and Jamie does too.
5689368	5692351	And between the two of them I get filled in on what's going on.
5692432	5694995	But yeah, otherwise I'm lost.
5695315	5697318	I'm just a dumb whitey.
5698810	5701493	Hey, I don't blame your... Just don't blame your color.
5702154	5702734	I know, I know.
5702774	5704056	It's just a joke, kids.
5704256	5704716	We're good guys.
5704777	5705998	I know, I know it's a joke.
5706458	5707179	We're good guys, Jim.
5708260	5710522	Yeah, I'm just... I'm just... I don't know.
5711844	5712124	Alright.
5712144	5713025	Hey, uh... Oh.
5713766	5714366	One more thing.
5714386	5714587	Sure.
5715808	5715848	Um...
5719819	5721000	2DX Bastard here.
5721040	5721840	Nice to meet you.
5722080	5722360	Oh, no.
5722400	5723641	I'm a 2DX Bastard, too.
5723801	5725262	I'm a 2DX and Poppenese Bastard.
5725282	5730304	Well, Siggy insists that he is the 2DX Bastard, so you're going to have to be like the 2DX wench.
5730844	5732325	Yeah, well, I love Keyboard Mania.
5732986	5733186	I know.
5733206	5734286	I want to be a... Screw y'all.
5734326	5735747	I'm a Keyboard Mania hussy.
5737168	5737448	No.
5737508	5738208	No, no, no, no.
5739189	5739909	All right, Siggy.
5739929	5740649	Thanks for calling in.
5740669	5742730	We're going to try and get to one more call, so I've got to let you go, okay?
5742750	5744431	It's all about dance, dance, dance.
5744451	5744951	Bye-bye.
5746052	5746372	Okay.
5746472	5747072	That was Siggy.
5747132	5748253	We enjoy having him on the program.
5749747	5751728	Let's get to one more call here tonight.
5751788	5755709	Hello, you're on Orange Sound Radio.
5755949	5757049	Hello, Ranchan.
5757209	5758370	What is on your mind?
5758410	5761451	You were the first to get the boot from DarkSakura tonight for the K-Word, weren't you?
5763071	5763571	Yes.
5764792	5767332	Oh, Ranchan, your connection is really, really bad right now.
5767372	5771374	If you've got anything you can turn off there in the background, please do so.
5771754	5773574	Yeah, no porn torrents, my friend.
5774034	5774855	No, I'm kidding, I know.
5775015	5776255	I know you wouldn't do that during the show.
5776375	5777556	I just killed it.
5777836	5778836	Alright, so what's on your mind?
5780160	5787046	I was there at Nintendo World this morning You got to see Miyamoto today Hell no No?
5787126	5787846	What happened?
5788907	5809584	Okay, this was the plan Me and my crew was going to go down there at 7am and relax and get on the line One of my friends said go down there 10 o'clock Saturday night and check it out I said I'll go down at 10 If I see a line I'm grabbing my bags and I'm going I never left I did not think it was going to be that packed Wow It was crazy
5810339	5814984	Only on NintendoWorld.com and if you're on the Nintendo mailing list.
5816146	5817247	So there was like 12 people?
5817267	5818108	No, like 12 million.
5831002	5831843	I don't think so.
5832364	5833004	I don't think so.
5833104	5834465	It was about 800 people there.
5834486	5834566	Yeah.
5853616	5854657	It's pretty sweet.
5854997	5855617	It's pretty sweet.
5855657	5858399	It's really nice because it looks so modern, you know?
5858659	5864062	Before, when it was the Pokemon, it looked all kiddy, but it looks really modern, like so 90s chic, you know?
5864563	5865023	Very cool.
5865143	5865543	Very cool.
5866244	5866544	Alright.
5866644	5868805	I'm also... A few more things and then I'll go.
5868825	5868965	Sure.
5868985	5873668	I'm seeing a link to the chat of a bunch of us hanging out today, trying to get inside.
5874033	5875014	Okay, so check that out.
5875074	5876794	Ron Chan just posted that in our chat room there.
5876834	5879196	It's a photobucket link of pictures from today.
5880136	5884298	And maybe if you look very carefully, you might see one little pixel that happens to be Miyamoto.
5884919	5886419	There's three pictures of Miyamoto up there.
5886699	5887180	Oh, okay, cool.
5887760	5890661	We got them from the window, and the first guy was on the line.
5890902	5894904	He flew in from Detroit, and he was there since 12 noon Saturday.
5896244	5896665	Wow.
5897405	5898105	See what I mean?
5898385	5899906	See what I mean about some crazy guys?
5900106	5901347	Are you looking at that link right now, Loki?
5903156	5904557	I see Ronchan, that must be the link.
5905298	5908520	Yeah, that's me as Link, yeah, that's my friend.
5908980	5910701	You dressed up in a Minish cap there.
5912362	5914163	No, somebody actually came with a Minish cap.
5914323	5916324	That was my classic Link hat that was made for me.
5916585	5918226	You bought a Minish cap and it came with a person?
5919546	5920167	No, I wish.
5921055	5922056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
5948860	5951282	We were chanting Mario just like that.
5952203	5955186	Second time we came to the window, we were shouting, Nintendo!
5955526	5956047	Nintendo!
5956067	5965155	There were people throwing up, holding up their Nintendo controllers, pads, consoles, Powerpads, Power Gloves, U-Forces.
5966336	5968798	Somebody walked down the street with an autographed Power Glove.
5969339	5971421	I'm telling you.
5971441	5972462	That is so bad.
5973570	5979313	Oh yeah, MTV was there and they're going to put a bunch of us on the whole Xbox video game special next month.
5979633	5982515	Wait, you're going to be on the Xbox video game special?
5983235	5989678	Yeah, they're doing like a video game special the week that Xbox comes out and they did a complete cover of Miyamoto being in town.
5989758	5994340	Wait, but do you see the problem with this?
5994981	5995581	Is it just me?
5996422	5999043	Because Miyamoto, last I checked, works for Nintendo.
6000279	6003361	Nintendo, MTV, Nintendo, Xbox, not Nintendo.
6003662	6005763	Wait, I thought Nintendo made the Xbox.
6006023	6007364	I'm completely wrong.
6010307	6011087	Oh my god.
6011428	6020494	Yeah, I would have loved to see the MTV crew going up going, Hey, so can we be first in line to order our Xbox 360 here?
6021475	6021715	No.
6021936	6023997	Yeah, I could see them interviewing Miyamoto.
6024337	6025959	So what do we have to look forward to in Halo 3?
6027904	6030325	We actually joke about that online, okay?
6030745	6041487	Well, at the end of... If you don't beat Halo 3 in a certain amount of time, then the moon is going to crash into the world and... We're sorry, Master Chief, but our princess is in another castle.
6041807	6042747	No, it's on another Halo.
6044347	6045228	All right, Ranma.
6045908	6046688	I'm booting you now.
6046828	6047448	But have a good one.
6047468	6048168	Thanks for calling.
6048928	6049208	You too.
6049228	6049388	Thanks.
6049408	6050469	I'm glad to hear you had fun today.
6050549	6051009	No problem.
6051149	6051669	Bye-bye.
6051729	6052109	Bye.
6053612	6054032	What the hell?
6054092	6057733	Why would MTV show a Miyamoto interview during an Xbox special?
6059093	6059473	Idiots!
6061474	6062934	That's the talented MTV.
6065514	6066615	MTV stands for what again?
6068135	6071316	Um, mushy, trashy videos?
6071356	6071696	I don't know.
6073156	6075337	You only see videos between like 2 and 4 a.m.
6075957	6077397	It's like the only time you can't buy booze.
6077417	6078697	You can see music videos, though.
6079197	6079437	Hmm.
6080078	6081118	Are they trying to tell us something?
6081478	6081778	I don't know.
6082098	6082358	I don't know.
6083502	6085745	All right, we're going to go to a break because we need a break.
6085765	6088649	When we come back from this break, we are going to get to the cage match.
6088669	6090411	We're going to get to the sim update of the week.
6090812	6092694	We're going to get to the FUs and a whole lot more.
6092774	6094697	And we're going to get to the winner of the contest.
6094717	6096259	This is your last chance to get in.
6096299	6097941	This is the last time I'm giving out this email.
6098462	6100365	We are going to give away momentarily.
6100985	6104308	of V-Rare for Max 2 and EX2.
6104668	6114737	And by entering tonight, you're not only going to be eligible for tonight's drawing, but you will already be eligible for this week's drawing, which we're going to turn loose to the thousands of people that listen to us on the podcast.
6115158	6116879	So your chances are much better tonight.
6116919	6121083	So get in now, send an email, freestuff at orangelaunchradio.com.
6121123	6123745	And if you're the winner, you better answer my reply or you don't get shit.
6124526	6124826	All right?
6125407	6126268	Woohoo, shit!
6126308	6128169	I thought shit was the other thing.
6128570	6130171	Yeah, that's the thing we're going to give away.
6130211	6132853	We have to talk about this during the break, how we're going to give this away, so we'll see.
6133834	6134434	In pieces.
6134594	6137076	Alright, we'll be back after this.
6137116	6142580	In this break, we're going to do one of my favorite songs from the Ultramix 3 VRare, because it sounds like synth pop.
6142921	6144382	It's Rain Dancer with Come With Me.
6144862	6149506	And then we're going to get to another song, which I don't have labeled, because I'm a dumbass.
6149686	6152228	It's, um... Track 10.
6152548	6153329	What was track 10?
6153369	6154630	I think it's another, um...
6155506	6156927	I couldn't hear you.
6156947	6159869	Rainbow Flyer is going to be the other song we hear in this break.
6159909	6162311	So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
6283941	6284854	Thanks for watching!
6316773	6317754	Thanks for watching!
6344734	6345475	Thanks for watching!
6376338	6377340	Thanks for watching!
6440201	6442251	I am the only God in the universe.
6499582	6500663	Thanks for watching!
6527788	6528930	Thank you for watching!
6576933	6577583	Thanks for watching!
6616586	6621108	Oh, Ash!
6621649	6624270	This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.
6627168	6628248	DarkSakura or Loki as well.
6652884	6653785	So give that a try.
6654045	6658888	We are going to give away those CDs any minute now, so free stuff at orangelaundry.com.
6658908	6661569	If you're not in there yet, you might just be SOL.
6662530	6665772	But what I do want to point out is something actually, Sakurina brought this to my attention.
6665792	6674016	There's a brand new page posted over at Konami Style that actually has some more information about Guitar Freaks V, the home release.
6674056	6676038	Of course, that being a big surprise at...
6677503	6683605	The Tokyo Game Show this year is that they are going to revive the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania series with V. And look at this.
6683805	6684165	Look at that.
6684505	6686486	That is an ASC, ladies and gentlemen.
6686526	6688426	That is the arcade-style controller.
6689367	6689727	Look at that.
6689767	6692408	They have the little metal cord and everything.
6692428	6693388	And the little strap.
6693828	6694948	That is going to be badass.
6695189	6695769	I want one.
6696009	6696989	So check that out.
6697549	6699230	And the link, again, is posted in the chat room.
6699270	6701190	It's over at KonamiStyle.jp.
6701751	6702491	Yep, I'm getting one.
6702511	6703371	In their custom factory.
6704111	6705972	Aren't those things going to be expensive, though?
6707012	6707872	Yeah, I know.
6708392	6711113	I am not a big enough fan of Guitar Freaks.
6711133	6713434	Do they have an extra hole so you can use it for other things?
6715234	6721256	Yeah, but you know I'm going to have one at my house because my husband is the world's biggest Guitar Freaks fan.
6721776	6725977	They advertise the game as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is being released.
6726077	6734260	So right now with the arcade style controller for Guitar Freaks, I believe Konami Style is doing the petition thing to get their polls and see like, okay, how much do you want to spend?
6734280	6735100	Do you really want it?
6735180	6735460	Okay.
6735984	6739086	I'm so excited that they're bringing Guitar Freaks back, though.
6739106	6741107	What I'm really excited and I hope they do is that they really...
6758658	6760339	Check that out on KonamiStyle.
6786241	6790104	Alright, what we're going to do now, we're going to place a very special phone call.
6790225	6794268	We've got a phone call that we need to make, and we're going to place that right now.
6794348	6797571	What we're going to do is we're going to call somebody who's actually in the hospital.
6798011	6802675	And it's somebody who's been on the show previously, but it's not a bad reason why she's in the hospital.
6802715	6804397	You'll see why momentarily.
6806759	6808720	First I've got to make sure I'm putting in the number correctly here.
6808841	6811623	We'll call this number here.
6812924	6813825	Hopefully this connects.
6817062	6819323	This would be quite embarrassing if this whole damn thing didn't work.
6821363	6823504	Those of you guys there in the chatroom probably know what this is about.
6823604	6824304	Oh, there we go, finally.
6824524	6825065	One ringy dingy.
6833667	6834348	Two ringy dingys.
6836308	6837148	Three ringy dingys.
6840009	6840430	Hello?
6841070	6842870	Hello, is this DD Archaholic?
6844551	6844891	Yes.
6845783	6848685	Anita, this is Rob on Orange Lounge Radio.
6848725	6849245	How are you?
6851687	6852348	Hi, Rob.
6852388	6852568	Hi.
6853368	6855109	You don't mind that I'm putting you on air right now, do you?
6856731	6857251	What's that?
6857351	6859232	You don't mind that I'm putting you on air right now, do you?
6861794	6862174	Oh, no.
6862234	6863195	I don't mind being on air.
6863995	6867218	We called to say congratulations.
6867418	6868439	Congratulations.
6868599	6869039	Thank you.
6869679	6870060	Tell us.
6870120	6870960	Tell us the details.
6871020	6871701	How did it go?
6871801	6872461	Boy or girl?
6872521	6873082	What's the name?
6873102	6873642	We want to know.
6873662	6874883	Okay.
6876175	6877896	I have a beautiful baby boy.
6879036	6881377	His name is Donovan Kiyoshi.
6881397	6883097	I missed that.
6883157	6883577	One more time.
6883637	6884017	One more time.
6884057	6888098	His name is Donovan Kiyoshi.
6888298	6889459	Donovan Kiyoshi.
6889559	6890199	Okay, cool.
6890419	6896441	And he was born Thursday at 1.30 in the afternoon.
6898521	6901782	And he weighed 6 pounds and 13 ounces.
6901922	6902002	Aww.
6902022	6904163	And he's tall.
6917611	6920173	We are so happy for you, Anita.
6920253	6921534	We want to see pictures.
6921614	6922454	We want to see pictures.
6922514	6923435	When do we get to see pictures?
6924996	6926257	Sure, very soon.
6926297	6928498	I'll be coming home from the hospital tomorrow.
6930760	6932661	I'll be able to post some pictures on the net.
6933061	6945264	Alright, and if those of you guys are wondering why we have... I have a live journal, and I can go on Orange Lounge, I can figure out to do it maybe on Orange Lounge's website.
6945564	6949586	Absolutely, absolutely, you've got to post those... If you want to do something like that, I can send you pictures.
6950306	6957208	Absolutely, you've got to post that on the site for us, so... Can you hear him calling right now?
6957348	6957588	What?
6957608	6957648	Oh!
6959928	6961989	He's right next to me...
6962982	6964864	I'm ready to eat, actually.
6964884	6966446	Thank you so much.
6966466	6967267	I'm so happy and proud to...
6980455	6982136	I'm so glad I can share it with you guys.
6982456	6984377	No problem.
6985177	6985997	Get well soon.
6986578	6991600	I'm asking Daniel to send me the hospital information so I can hopefully visit soon, like this week sometime.
6991640	6993040	Well, hopefully you won't be there much longer.
6993380	6995121	Oh, she's out tomorrow?
6995581	6996061	Oh, I didn't know.
6996422	6997362	Yeah, I'm out tomorrow.
6997482	6998202	Oh, well, crap.
6998222	7000243	I still want to come see the baby, so I'll have to come to your house.
7001124	7004905	I know it's a long drive, but maybe I can do it in the next couple weeks or so.
7005165	7008747	Okay.
7008787	7009727	I'll contact you offline.
7011198	7011638	Okay.
7011778	7012039	All right.
7012079	7015881	Well, Anita, congratulations once again from all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you.
7017122	7018783	One of our regulars having a baby.
7018843	7019543	We're so excited.
7019603	7020664	So congratulations.
7020804	7021924	And tell Donovan we said hi.
7024146	7025146	Oh, I will.
7025186	7026867	Thank you guys very much, too.
7027107	7027868	No problem.
7027968	7028328	Kisses.
7028408	7034312	Everybody, all my friends and all my Damani friends and all my Orange Lounge friends, hi, everybody.
7034792	7035633	Share those drugs.
7036093	7036793	Kisses.
7036853	7037454	Kisses, honey.
7037534	7037954	Take care.
7039337	7039822	Okay.
7039902	7040205	All right.
7040246	7040711	Bye-bye.
7041014	7041296	Bye-bye.
7042626	7043287	Oh, that's so sweet.
7043367	7046689	I apologize to our listeners that Skype is a little bit crappy.
7047109	7048490	I don't really know how else to phrase that.
7048530	7049751	Skype's running a little bit crappy.
7050111	7053594	But our chat room just full of congratulations there.
7053714	7055395	Daniel's actually in chat right now.
7055455	7059158	So if you want to give congratulations to Daddy, Daddy's in chat right now.
7059538	7060779	OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
7061239	7061960	Click on chat.
7062160	7069145	And he's there to take those good wishes back to Anita from those of you guys in chat since you weren't able to talk to her on Skype.
7069165	7069245	Okay.
7069838	7074862	All right, well, I think it's time now for us to move into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
7076943	7095036	The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you, back to back to back, and you guys vote for your favorites, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're not here.
7095596	7096717	Yuzo Koshiro, Midnight Maximum Tune
7112173	7112573	Right on.
7113133	7117375	And the song is Destination Blackout, and it was Miss DarkSakura's pick from last week.
7117395	7120456	Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. DarkSakura's pick from last week.
7121136	7122357	Don't roll your eyes at me.
7122617	7123477	Marriage is bliss.
7123677	7124577	Blah, blah, blah.
7124677	7124978	Is it?
7125458	7125858	All right.
7126398	7131540	Here it is, a clip of song number one, Destination Blackout, here on Orange Lounge, the Cage Match.
7163940	7164681	I want to see it now.
7164701	7165142	No gravity.
7165222	7165322	One.
7244201	7248905	Alrighty, that was a clip of song number one, Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.
7248945	7251146	Received some very good marks on last week's show.
7251607	7257111	So we'll see if it continues to win for a second week in a row, or if it falls prey to one of our challengers tonight.
7257171	7258072	Loki, you're up first.
7258112	7259793	What did you pick for us tonight?
7260654	7267899	Well, I got a copy of the Diverse 9 album, and this is one of the tracks, actually one of the last tracks.
7267959	7271342	And I remember listening to the demo of this back when I was looking at this.
7272146	7272907	The Black Mages Doresia
7298588	7300250	Thanks for watching!
7321625	7323227	Thanks for watching!
7541479	7543802	That one's coming to you courtesy of Diverse Systems.
7543862	7551473	That's Doresia with V. Let's go around and see if V gets an A or an F. DarkSakura.
7551854	7552755	I couldn't get into it.
7553657	7556240	It just was disjointed.
7557282	7558083	Disjointed, okay.
7558800	7564302	So it was above average, but definitely below the greatest thing I've ever heard.
7564362	7572125	Definitely better than just about everything I've heard off that V-Rare, so it gets a seven and a half.
7572265	7572865	Seven and a half.
7573525	7573846	Loki.
7574566	7575106	Gets a nine.
7575146	7576707	I've been blasting this into my car.
7577807	7578107	Bugged.
7579808	7580148	Seven.
7581468	7581869	Garrett.
7582629	7582909	Seven.
7584313	7585033	I'm going to give it an 8.
7585553	7588394	I liked it, but I don't know.
7588494	7594695	Something about Bomani songs in Cage Match is weird to me, but I still liked it, so I'm going to give it an 8.
7595375	7596416	So, it was cool.
7597116	7600077	Alright, my song we're going to do tonight, song number 3.
7600137	7608098	Now, a lot of people have been ripping on Zonk over that remix, so I thought, okay, I'm going to give Zonk a chance with one of their original songs.
7608278	7611259	So I'm going to put Zonk in tonight's Cage Match, because I really couldn't think of anything else.
7614066	7615367	It's not a Bomani song.
7615427	7616248	It's not a Bomani song.
7616268	7617609	It's an original Zonk song.
7618450	7618990	Kiss my butt.
7619391	7619671	All right.
7620151	7624595	This is Zonk, song number three tonight with Nervous, Excited, Delighted.
7624915	7625316	Check this out.
7625336	7632702	It's one of their original songs from their latest EP, which is called... Shit, I don't remember the name of this EP.
7632722	7635164	I think it's... I would order just on that name alone.
7635344	7636325	It's Half Human.
7636525	7636825	Thank you.
7636905	7637866	Half Human is the name of it.
7637886	7638106	All right.
7638126	7638427	Here it is.
7638747	7640188	Nervous, Excited, Delighted.
7640488	7640729	Enjoy.
7688721	7689321	Lander, Lander
7761421	7772664	I guess this place is ridiculous So wave your hands and shake your butt It's time that we get dangerous Bye bye purple shadow Something dangerous Nothing's exciting, the light is Something dangerous
7829716	7831118	Thanks for watching!
7868004	7869225	Thanks for watching!
7896594	7897635	Thank you for watching!
7918393	7922535	Song number three in tonight's cage match is Zonk, Nervous, Excited, Delighted.
7922595	7926256	Let's see if that song delighted the folks here in the studio.
7926516	7928837	But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys in chat.
7929197	7929498	Jamie.
7930378	7935600	My first impression of it was that I was liking it, I was getting into it, and then it started to repeat.
7936400	7941482	And it's sort of like, duh, duh, duh, repeat, repeat.
7942203	7942743	Oh, it's over.
7944008	7955995	So, um, I like it better than Loki's pick, because it had a cool kind of groove to it, and wasn't all disjointed, but it did sort of... Are you saying, it had a good beat, and it was easy to dance to?
7956315	7963259	No, it had a good deep beat, but I would probably fall asleep dancing to it, so... Um, it gets an 8.5.
7963559	7964180	8.5 from DarkSakura.
7964200	7964500	Loki!
7965440	7971404	It gets, like, a 7.5, because it was better than the remix that was on the Ultramix 3 soundtrack, but, uh...
7972370	7973851	They do some weird stuff.
7974351	7974891	It was okay, though.
7974911	7976432	I didn't find it repetitive or anything like that.
7976752	7977172	It was good.
7977353	7977633	Bud!
7979454	7980714	I didn't want it, nor did I need it.
7980754	7981114	Five.
7981835	7982195	Good.
7983336	7984236	I zonked out.
7984396	7986637	Six.
7987077	7988778	Um, I actually, you know, I kind of liked it.
7988858	7992220	I liked it better than Tittle Tattle, and I liked it better than their Ultramix 3 remix.
7992640	8001625	And I think if they DDR cut that, they'd lose a lot of the repetitiveness of the song, and I think it'd be a pretty groovy cut for DDR, so I hope they consider it for Ultramix, what, four?
8002466	8004528	Or, heck, the next Ultramix will probably be a 360 game.
8004608	8005949	Ultramix V, Red!
8006269	8006670	Ultramix 360.
8008491	8008772	Anyway.
8008992	8010273	The Ultramix Purple!
8010433	8013275	Here it is, guys, the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.
8013315	8016398	Song number one is Destination Blackout, last week's winner.
8026467	8029650	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Doresia with V.
8039331	8043606	And song number three you can vote for tonight is Zonk with Nervous, Excited, Delighted.
8053106	8055407	Place vote now.
8055507	8058888	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8058968	8060528	Now you can flood me with private messages.
8060568	8061148	That's okay.
8061228	8064930	I need to interrupt for something that's really freaking... Alright, wait.
8065030	8065750	Place vote now.
8065770	8066730	We'll get to your votes momentarily.
8066770	8066950	What?
8067390	8069311	Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico.
8069431	8070451	This is not from The Onion.
8070471	8071612	This is from Slashdot.
8073992	8074793	Armed dolphins?
8074993	8077373	Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico.
8078534	8079354	Dolphins don't have arms.
8081775	8082095	Fiend?
8082656	8083016	Dolphins?
8084377	8086439	That sounds like the next Grand Theft Auto game to me.
8087280	8088381	Are they ill-tempered?
8088841	8091824	Taking this series where no one has dared take it before.
8092464	8092925	Dolphins.
8095047	8099030	I noticed my roommate Extrofer is here, so I want to give Extrofer a chance to say something on the show.
8099090	8099811	Don't zone out on me.
8101092	8102153	Something on the show.
8102173	8102393	Hi.
8102613	8105356	Well, no, actually, we did a segment a couple weeks ago.
8105376	8108679	I'd like to bring back this segment, and that would be Extrofer's movie reveal.
8109846	8110547	Oh, okay.
8110647	8114054	Okay, so, so, Exifer, give us a movie review on Corpse Bride.
8115156	8117661	Um, Corpse Bride, it was pretty good.
8118343	8119744	It was good watching.
8120185	8121806	Excitement in the theater.
8122086	8122907	Thank you for that review.
8123247	8123728	Thumbs up?
8123788	8124648	Thumbs down?
8124789	8126930	It was nicely done.
8127030	8136618	I liked The Nightmare Before Christmas better, but this one definitely was more emotional, more dramatic than The Nightmare Before Christmas.
8137799	8139521	Anyways, that's my whole take on that.
8139601	8140001	Thumbs up?
8140061	8140542	Thumbs down?
8140622	8141282	Thumbs sideways?
8141483	8144125	Thumbs diagonal ways?
8145447	8146348	Diagonal Waves.
8146508	8147169	Okay.
8147629	8148230	I don't know.
8148250	8151392	I was starting to think of Margaret Cho's mother, her impression.
8151973	8153214	Oh, my body to jump!
8154415	8156157	Oh, my body was jumping!
8157598	8157918	All right.
8158839	8160380	People were exploding in the theater.
8160480	8161361	It was great.
8162062	8162322	All right.
8162522	8163643	Thank you, Extra for that.
8163963	8166646	Now, what movie are you going to see next week that you can review?
8167723	8173486	Um, well, I'm gonna see Serenity again, but I've already, like, talked that one up like crazy.
8173586	8176167	So you're gonna have to see two movies, so you have something for us next Sunday.
8176507	8176807	Okay.
8177027	8177687	Don't let me down.
8178148	8178408	Okay.
8178528	8180569	Rent something on Netflix, DVD, I don't know.
8180709	8181929	Find a movie and review it next week.
8182349	8182609	Loki?
8184330	8186431	I forgot to mention, I did see a movie.
8186851	8191353	Um, I watched the Reefer Madness, the musical, the movie.
8192434	8193094	It was great.
8195566	8196366	Is your name Extifer?
8196646	8198407	No, you don't do movie reviews on the show.
8199227	8202848	I've had somebody watch a movie that she has never seen before and it was interesting.
8202948	8203348	What's that?
8203828	8210350	I sat Tia down and let her watch the full Leon.
8212070	8214110	Oh, I need to see the full Leon.
8214130	8215611	She's never seen it at all.
8216111	8217211	I've only seen the butchered one.
8217491	8220172	I've never seen the movie at all.
8220472	8224573	I've already seen it all the way through because I had a French copy of it a while back.
8225427	8228668	Like, is the uncut version, does he have sex with her or something?
8228788	8229308	No.
8229348	8230228	What makes it so uncut?
8230248	8231349	She kisses him.
8231929	8232389	Oh, okay.
8232949	8234610	It has more of the love story in it.
8235330	8236270	Oh.
8236490	8240531	For those of you guys in chat, somebody's freaking out about Serenity.
8240591	8240931	Where?
8241412	8242052	It's this Friday.
8242212	8242772	In the theaters.
8242872	8243972	This Friday in theaters.
8244012	8247773	You can check out Yahoo.com, enter in your zip code, and you can find out like the rest of us.
8247853	8249794	And it's really, really, really, really, really good.
8250434	8251774	Because you saw a sneak preview, right?
8251955	8253115	I did see a sneak preview.
8253215	8253555	Good job.
8253835	8256697	And it has all the hot men's in it, right?
8257258	8259820	It has a few hot men's in it.
8259860	8261281	Because I think the captain is hot.
8261781	8262702	The captain is hot?
8262742	8265764	I would do him if I wasn't married.
8266184	8271448	When you're a professional movie reviewer, like you are now on Orange Lounge, you get to advance screenings.
8271629	8273150	So you should actually get your card out there.
8274687	8276668	Because you can be our official movie reviewer, okay?
8276688	8278189	Hello, Extifer OLR.
8279670	8280110	Very good.
8280150	8281110	Can I get my ticket, please?
8282211	8283672	And then you can get into E3 and everything.
8283692	8289695	Yeah, because they'll let professional Extifer movie reviewer in.
8290575	8292536	All right, let's get to tonight's Sim Update.
8292576	8294117	Then we're going to give away some CDs.
8294477	8299280	Sim Update, Loki, what's going on in the Sim world?
8299640	8303122	Well, I played more Food Mix 2, and it was good, but...
8304949	8309550	Still nothing really too much else going on other than the release of Food Mix 2 last week.
8311531	8313851	Really, I think Tourney Mix 6 is over.
8314131	8315992	I hope it is because I'm over with it.
8316312	8323394	And there's a new, what was it, a new, there's another new file tournament coming up.
8323754	8325054	Really, nothing going on.
8325214	8326135	Nothing at all.
8326355	8327955	Just play Food Mix 2 and wait it out.
8329755	8332297	You need to fill time with something because I'm tallying cage match votes here.
8332357	8333438	Last call for cage match votes.
8333458	8336320	Anyways, since I'm filling time.
8336340	8340264	Yeah, I need some alcohol.
8340284	8340324	No.
8340484	8342866	What was it?
8342906	8344247	Reefer Madison the movie is awesome.
8345288	8346589	Because, you know, it's so funny.
8346609	8349291	It's got, let's see who was in it.
8349331	8352634	It's got just a lot of funny people.
8353134	8354155	A lot of funny people.
8354465	8355686	This is some Showtime thing.
8356066	8357467	I actually want to see the stage play of it.
8357948	8359169	It looked really neat.
8359609	8362732	It's basically an anti-marijuana movie.
8363232	8364233	Or was, supposedly.
8364273	8367435	It's based off a 1930s propaganda film put out by the government.
8368576	8371819	Where basically people smoke pot and then they turn into zombies and kill people.
8372379	8375202	And have sex and turn into whores and worship saints.
8375222	8376362	That makes me want to smoke pot.
8377764	8378424	It's a great movie.
8380085	8381467	Yes, so basically... Shit!
8382547	8383048	Shit!
8383652	8384633	Trick, if you're a fag
8405971	8407872	Okay, who else was in this?
8408473	8413476	Oh, fellow SNL cast member Ana Gustair was in it.
8413796	8414116	Okay.
8414756	8415437	She was hilarious.
8415517	8418318	Love her impersonation of Martha Stewart, topless Halloween special.
8420039	8420900	Christmas special.
8421620	8421881	Whatever.
8422381	8423682	But it was pretty funny.
8424302	8425162	I highly recommend it.
8425183	8425623	It's coming out.
8425683	8429865	It's going to be packaged with the actual 1930s movie as well.
8430266	8430806	It's really funny.
8431026	8432127	Great.
8432207	8433868	Actually, I need to ask Eksta for something.
8434128	8434328	Okay.
8434348	8434428	Okay.
8434853	8440637	My friend in her live journal described Corpse Bride, and I want to see if you agree with her description.
8440917	8441177	Okay.
8441717	8445660	Corpse Bride was one of those nice, heartwarming tales that touches you in all the wrong places.
8449102	8452684	Well, I didn't feel physically touched by it.
8453045	8455166	Show me on the doll where Corpse Bride touched you.
8456066	8457607	It touched me in the pee-pee.
8458488	8458888	Thank you.
8459849	8460289	All right.
8460789	8461450	It felt good.
8466161	8469342	Okay, I think we need to save this show by giving something away.
8469682	8470422	Yay!
8470522	8471763	Let's give some shit away.
8472423	8477705	DarkSakura, pull a number out of the hat, which actually would be your ass in this case, because we don't really have a hat.
8477985	8480805	So pull a number out of your ass, and who's our winner?
8481146	8482046	I'll pull it out of my boobs.
8482506	8483046	All right, do that.
8483326	8483806	Who's our winner?
8484707	8485227	Number eight.
8485527	8489208	Number eight.
8489848	8491909	Our lucky winner tonight is...
8493308	8496910	Fireboma won tonight's V-Rare.
8496930	8503413	He won a copy of the EX-2 and Max-2 V-Rare.
8503473	8508195	So Fireboma, check your email in about five minutes because I'm going to be looking for your address.
8508255	8509736	But you need to send that to a different account.
8509776	8510536	Don't send that to the...
8512523	8513023	Free Stuff 1.
8513463	8519666	Now if you didn't win, you guys, if you didn't win, don't worry because you are already entered because you're a live show listener.
8520046	8521326	You actually get two shots at this.
8521646	8524167	We're really kissing your ass because you take time on Sunday nights to listen to this.
8524467	8531610	You automatically are entered into the drawing that we're going to do next Sunday, which our whole podcast now it's opened up to.
8531890	8533351	Please do not send another email.
8533591	8534491	You're already in it.
8534631	8535571	You don't have to send another one.
8535871	8537132	So look forward to that.
8538476	8538857	All right.
8539317	8542082	So, sorry to those of you guys who didn't win, but you have a second chance.
8542222	8542783	You have a second chance.
8542823	8544806	And we'll do that next week.
8545226	8550113	So, congratulations, Fireboma, who apparently left chat and went to bed.
8550374	8550855	Good job.
8551823	8552463	Firebomba.
8552523	8554204	I think that disqualifies him.
8554264	8555725	No, we can't disqualify him.
8555805	8557186	He won fair and square.
8557266	8557807	He won.
8558527	8559307	Bastard.
8559808	8560888	Leaving and going to sleep.
8561409	8561689	All right.
8561709	8562489	Who needs sleep?
8562609	8563670	Sleep is for weenies.
8563710	8563950	All right.
8564370	8568193	And some folks in chat say they want the Max 2 VRare still very bad.
8568213	8573836	And they heard me slip up earlier and say that we actually have three Max 2 VRares and two EX2s.
8573876	8576117	So we will find a way to give those away.
8576698	8577098	Absolutely.
8577478	8578399	Maybe a bonus?
8578919	8579159	Maybe.
8579279	8579619	We'll see.
8579699	8580019	We'll see.
8580600	8581740	We might give away a bonus or something.
8582401	8585862	Well, congratulations to Narcoleptic Firebomber who won.
8588244	8588924	I see how it is.
8588964	8590865	You enter the contest and then leave us.
8591125	8594447	Somebody should send him a copy of this show where we're just razzing on him for not being here.
8595467	8597850	How dare sleep be more important than Orange Lounge?
8598050	8600673	That's like the people who leave us to go watch Family Guy.
8600993	8603917	Dude, Family Guy this season has not been funny.
8604237	8605158	It's been great.
8605218	8607421	I don't know if we... Have we been watching the same show?
8607921	8611305	Family Guy is a great show, don't get me wrong, but the last two episodes this season have been...
8611946	8614987	I got linked to a disturbing TV Tokyo page for an anime called Ice Shield 21.
8615027	8616248	It's about American football.
8616328	8618329	I find that hilarious and I oddly want to see it.
8635765	8636745	All right, we're going to go to a break.
8661423	8664190	Sharpen your quills because you're going to be doing some writing.
8664411	8668802	And we'll get to the details on that contest when we come back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
8685805	8686467	Thanks for watching!
8719264	8720065	Thanks for watching!
8885096	8889561	Love or truth, this is what I prove between me and you.
8889601	8892744	Love or truth, whichever you choose is for me.
8972404	8973986	Thank you for watching!
9009575	9010197	Thanks for watching!
9057028	9058753	Thank you for watching!
9119119	9125062	Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in more shows?
9125082	9132226	The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.
9132566	9134547	It's unearthly.
9134787	9138529	It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.
9139390	9139870	All right.
9140250	9142051	Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
9142151	9142692	Here we are.
9143192	9143432	Another...
9144302	9172061	Show, almost to a close, we got a good half hour of show left And we got still the FUs to get to, and all sorts of other stuff as well First off though, what I wanted to do I was gonna, oh man, I was trying to find this sound file I had If you're doing what I think you're doing, you can just stop it Stop it
9173450	9174451	I don't know where it went.
9174511	9175232	I'm so sad.
9194492	9196713	And then we all started giggling and Loki's like, shut up!
9198194	9199515	I was being serious.
9199635	9201296	It really is a lot of fun.
9201696	9202497	But it's really funny.
9202557	9205038	It's a lot better than Final Fantasy XI, number one.
9205478	9206439	Ah, shut your pie hole.
9206719	9207019	Alright.
9207459	9209160	You've never played it, so you don't know.
9209260	9209701	I've seen it.
9209721	9212002	You don't have to party with stupid people.
9212162	9213823	I don't trash on World of Warcraft, though.
9213923	9214783	I think it's okay.
9214903	9216364	I just, you know, I'm obsessed with it.
9216384	9220386	Well, no, no, no, no, because I'm very bitter toward Final Fantasy XI because of the idiots.
9220627	9221047	I know, I know.
9221667	9226032	Okay, it's like, hi, I'm going to give you warning before I decide to buff everybody.
9226653	9232659	And I'm half tempted that if, you know, I give you a 20 second delay to get there before I cast the shit.
9233060	9234581	And if they're not there, screw it.
9234722	9235562	No haste for you.
9237825	9238185	You done?
9238386	9238706	Feel better?
9239654	9239955	No.
9240355	9242378	Because they make white mages bitches in that game.
9242418	9246983	We're going to go from one rant to another.
9247524	9250268	In the Groove, we have completely defaced this copy of In the Groove.
9250328	9252270	Extifer, you actually need to add something to this too.
9252450	9253512	Inside now.
9253732	9254713	This has been defaced, huh?
9256710	9258731	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9287153	9291014	It's the Orange Lounge Radio haiku contest.
9291515	9296096	What you have to do is you have to write a haiku about In The Groove.
9296656	9302098	And we, the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, will pick our favorite, and that will be the winner of this.
9302538	9307540	And it is totally up to the three of us, whatever judging criteria we want to use, we will pick our favorite.
9307560	9309061	But there is one little catch.
9309141	9310181	Jamie, tell them about the catch.
9310895	9313718	It's not in traditional haiku format, first of all.
9314758	9315579	Well, sort of.
9316260	9319162	Your first line must be five syllables.
9320503	9322665	Your second line must be seven syllables.
9322905	9324506	And your last line must be three.
9325827	9332032	Ah, so instead of 5-7-5, you have to do a 5-7-3 haiku.
9332233	9333954	We call this the OLR format.
9333974	9335035	Yes, the OLR format.
9335075	9339779	And if you catch on to what 5-7-3 means, congratulations, you're a dork.
9341653	9345196	Alright, so it's the 5-7-3 haiku that you have to do.
9345916	9352722	Send your entries, the 5-7-3 haiku on In The Groove to haiku at orangeloungeradio.com.
9353242	9353822	Haiku.
9355003	9356885	H-I-K-U.
9359821	9360482	Thank you for watching!
9380638	9386640	Don't think that just because you can't write, you have a whole week to think about this, kids.
9386840	9388221	You have a whole week, at least.
9388461	9391602	And if you don't know how to write, then go back to school.
9391622	9392242	5-7-3.
9392503	9393823	That's all you need.
9393843	9394263	5-7-3.
9395244	9396724	Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables.
9396764	9397965	The favorite will win.
9398065	9399185	Send those entries to Haiku.
9399465	9402646	For those of you that can't spell, H-A-I-K-U.
9402707	9404747	Haiku at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
9404787	9405728	And we will pick our favorite.
9406268	9407308	Which is Ukiah backward.
9408329	9409029	Thank you for that.
9411035	9412116	That's the way I remember it, oddly.
9436226	9436666	You can't!
9436726	9437747	It's in permanent marker!
9438208	9438928	And pink pen.
9440469	9442871	And on top of that, this is no longer in the groove.
9443071	9444752	It's, I stepped in the poop.
9446854	9447134	Alright.
9448475	9450176	573 Haiku about in the groove.
9450216	9452758	Send those to haiku at orange launch radio dot com.
9453099	9458723	Alright, now I'm sure a lot of people are getting angsty here, so it's time to do the FUs of the week.
9459163	9460564	The FUs of the week.
9460584	9460844	Huh?
9460864	9463947	Oh, you want to know the cage match winner?
9463987	9465428	I suppose we should do that as well, shouldn't we?
9468075	9469676	Oh, I always forget to do the cage match winner.
9471077	9474740	Tonight's cage match winner was kind of a landslide.
9475201	9485508	Shouldn't be a surprise with this crowd that V by Dorsaria wins tonight's cage match because you guys are whores for V. Tools, all of you.
9487030	9487370	Sheep.
9488971	9489151	Sure.
9490052	9490752	You're all a bunch of sheep.
9495034	9496815	Because of Loki's V-Mix.
9520396	9521136	That's my week.
9522317	9528120	A big F you just to being stuck by myself while my man's off in Texas.
9528160	9531641	I wish my job would send me to Texas randomly.
9532742	9536824	So that I'm like, you know, not anywhere near California.
9537544	9545747	Um, FU goes to jury duty sort of halfway because I actually wanted to go so that I could sleep in about two hours more than normal.
9546567	9551008	And, uh, no, I have to go to work and then check back at 11 to see if I have to go.
9551228	9552429	I get to go the week after.
9553329	9553829	Good for you.
9554289	9555210	I bet you feel special.
9555610	9556510	No, I hate it.
9557369	9558250	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
9584164	9588046	But if it's like some really rich and powerful person, I don't want to do that because then they hunt down the jury.
9589106	9591968	Or they're convicted for being morons.
9592268	9594249	I really want to nail a stupid person though.
9594289	9596870	I want to be on the jury for like someone who did something really stupid.
9596890	9600612	Because they go, ah, you're stupid and guilty.
9601913	9606315	F you to, and I hate saying F you to my man because I love him so much.
9607415	9623400	But after me being so lonely and missing him so much, he comes home and wakes my ass up by banging on the metal door and then fusses at me, accusing me of not doing the dishes, which I did the dishes three times while he was gone, okay?
9624220	9626641	And then, it was just because I had company last night.
9627181	9634103	And then, and then, I'm, you know, doing homework and he, no, he says he's taking a shower, so I start doing my homework.
9634824	9636085	And then he's gone.
9636185	9637025	I don't know where he is.
9637105	9637945	So I finish my homework.
9637965	9638906	I put up my puppies.
9639326	9641387	I get started on working on another project.
9641447	9643708	And then he comes up and says, Oh yeah, I told you I was going across the street.
9644388	9644948	No you didn't!
9645328	9647129	And if you did, you need to make sure that I heard you.
9648163	9650264	And then he says, you would come play Madden with us?
9650524	9669390	And I hate, like, American football more than anything, just about, except for idiots, because most of the time it really is, you know, I think of football and I think of big, fat, ugly, butt-toothed rednecks, you know, the stereotypical redneck, drinking a beer, you know, drinking a Bud or a Coors, something nasty.
9670362	9676425	You know, in a wife beater and, you know, torn up jeans or shorts or like boxers or something.
9676445	9680247	I have this mental image because I have actually seen it.
9680887	9682508	Multiple times in different places.
9682608	9683489	Usually in Mississippi.
9684149	9685950	Um, so yeah.
9686871	9687391	I can't.
9688691	9689392	I was so mad.
9689672	9690833	And then I come here mad.
9691313	9693594	And then I still don't have my game.
9696756	9697916	Which irks me.
9698076	9698677	The K game.
9698877	9699377	The K game.
9700660	9702880	Loki's turn, boys and girls!
9726540	9733424	My first FU is going to be going to a demographic of people I usually don't hit up quite as often as I do about bad drivers who are women.
9733744	9735345	And this is bad drivers who are old.
9736285	9737206	Like, for example...
9737677	9744339	We had retard old person today who decided stop means don't stop, stop means just keep going through.
9744779	9758403	So as I'm on my way to Best Buy today, you know, I make a left or a right hand turn on a four-way stop and I go through there and dumb old guy slows down briefly and then goes nearly like rear-ending my car.
9759003	9766690	So then I'm pulling up to the stop, um, the next stop sign, which is a two, you know, a three-way stop, and dumbass pulls up next to me.
9766951	9778041	There is no other lane, there's only one lane, and he's trying to create his own lane, and so I go and he goes right next to me, thus creating his own lane, I guess, because he's old and stupid and his car sucked.
9778581	9782425	So, fuck you, the old people, because you can't drive and you need to be off the road.
9783884	9786027	And you're not the only old person that's done this.
9786207	9790050	There are other old people that drive too slow, other old people that don't look at where they're going.
9790451	9794915	Whenever I see a car on the road, it's of one of a couple criteria.
9795376	9796737	Woman or old person.
9797057	9798759	Or an old woman, which is the worst.
9799640	9803143	The bigger the hair, the slower they drive, so... Yeah.
9803944	9804084	Yeah.
9806044	9809666	I do have to say that there was a guy probably about in his early 20s.
9810386	9817629	There's this one intersection by Red Robin going on Sunrise for anyone who lives in the area where you have two left turn lanes.
9818169	9819909	One of them turns right and can go straight too.
9820570	9825651	And then there's actually two left lanes.
9826812	9829553	Well, the guy pulls into the opposite traffic lane as a turn lane.
9832797	9835558	And we roll down the window and go, um, hey, you, over here.
9835638	9837419	And he's, like, driving, like, a Camaro.
9838940	9839360	My favorite?
9840601	9841541	It was no bitchin' Camaro.
9842462	9843162	It was a guy.
9844483	9846524	My favorite, though, is the guys that, you know, pull up.
9847024	9848385	We're in the left turn lane, okay?
9848405	9851766	There's only a left turn lane and, you know, a lane that goes straight and right.
9852266	9859610	And this guy pulls up into oncoming traffic, goes to the left of the left turn lane, and makes a left turn when the light's just green to go straight.
9860896	9865600	It's like, holy crap, you just completely ignored every single traffic law right there.
9866021	9874989	I had another lady today in her van pull straight through the red, um, through the stop sign, just didn't even slow down, just went 50 miles an hour through the stop sign.
9875249	9876090	Three hour show, Loki.
9880194	9886560	Okay, Rob, I'm going to talk really fast then.
9888442	9894307	So, my other F.U.
9896729	9908078	was to screaming kids in the movie last night.
9909059	9909299	The end.
9917546	9920148	F you to Loki for being a jackass.
9920468	9922510	F you to Renie in chatroom for calling me a liar.
9923230	9925352	I hope your copy of EX2 is scratched and doesn't work.
9925993	9926413	Just kidding.
9926573	9927634	Heart.
9928835	9933438	F you to this pink thing that I have on my desk.
9933819	9936761	I don't even know what it is, but I always want to play with it.
9937581	9938262	I don't know why.
9938282	9940784	You know how they have training wheels?
9940804	9941805	Well, that's a training cock ring.
9941945	9943606	No, this is not a training cock ring.
9944106	9944907	This would never fit.
9945507	9945828	This is...
9946488	9948049	It was on a CD spindle, I think.
9948069	9949669	That's why it's so small.
9949709	9951049	And I can't stop playing with it.
9951109	9951730	It's smooshy.
9952170	9956031	I should send this to a contest winner so it's out of my house.
9956131	9956831	Maybe I'll do that.
9957691	9959732	You can play with this, too.
9960152	9962513	My finger's been in this hole I don't know how many times.
9964493	9965294	Do you want to sign it?
9965374	9966094	I have sharpies.
9967105	9970969	Somebody's going to cut that little clip of the show and make a YTMND out of it.
9973812	9974473	Yeah, Loki.
9976455	9977776	I should send that to a random listener.
9978677	9978997	Anyway.
9982821	9983962	Let's see, what else do I have in FU?
9984002	9985224	I'm not going to sign it and give it away.
9985264	9986105	It's my pink thing.
9986145	9988127	The listeners can get their own pink thing.
9988947	9990229	I bet you many of them do.
9991375	9992816	and, um... Shut up.
9995438	10003064	Uh... An F you to, um... me having to clean house this week because we have company over this weekend and I don't want to clean.
10003605	10004365	Cleaning sucks.
10005246	10006747	I want a robot that cleans for me.
10007728	10008388	I should get married.
10008408	10008969	You need Rosie.
10010290	10011391	Oh, from the Jetsons?
10011511	10012672	You need Rosie from the Jetsons.
10014113	10014473	Alright.
10014673	10017736	Let's go to some other F yous including those in-house.
10017776	10019137	Let's talk to, um...
10020359	10020619	Bugged!
10020939	10021480	What's your F.U.
10021500	10021820	this week?
10022260	10022441	F.U.
10022461	10032008	to the giant scratch somebody put on my hood Thursday night when I was in San Jose getting blasted off my ass at the Tide House for a birthday party.
10033629	10034129	Second F.U.
10034169	10044877	to Maximum Tune at UC Davis for gleefully accepting my card and then telling me, hey, drop three more bucks and we'll import your card data to another card that'll work with our machine.
10046358	10047539	Yeah, right.
10048513	10051055	and FU for Netflix for not working damn faster.
10051996	10055079	I want that movie the next fucking day, not the day after.
10056901	10058462	Use wormholes or some shit like that.
10062205	10062506	That's it.
10062706	10062966	All right.
10063487	10063767	Garrett.
10066029	10071173	An FU to eBears who sell forged autographs on items.
10073175	10074116	That was short and sweet.
10074617	10074977	Extaper.
10077341	10082037	F you to guys that say the exact wrong thing during sex.
10086909	10087129	Okay.
10087329	10088550	Okay, you want the story?
10088670	10090051	Okay then, Extifer.
10090491	10091992	Sure, Extifer.
10092112	10097195	Tell us all about your sex, or I'm sorry, of sex that your friend had.
10097455	10103139	Well, we were busy having sex, and he says... Oh, look at that!
10103239	10103519	Look at that!
10103539	10104960	We just lost half our listeners!
10105080	10105800	Good job, Extifer!
10105861	10106581	Oh, no problem.
10106941	10107962	No, I'm still talking.
10108522	10112505	Um, so, I have... I'm sorry, I forgot this was the Extifer show!
10112725	10112865	What...
10113385	10113926	My dad.
10114086	10115387	Well, thanks for remembering.
10116048	10126698	No, I, so basically he stops as, you know, we're into it and he says something like, yeah, so I'm not in the mood for getting into a relationship right now.
10127279	10132123	And I looked at him and I said, why are you going to say something stupid like that while we're having sex?
10132183	10133845	I'm like, sex is stupid.
10134245	10135947	You don't have a brain when you're having sex.
10135987	10136648	You don't think.
10137168	10138649	You don't say things that you think of.
10139189	10140229	I'm like, unless they're dirty.
10140409	10141530	You say dirty things.
10141670	10143371	I mean, I can think of very many dirty things.
10143651	10145952	I can probably say a bunch of them right now if I wanted to.
10146452	10147052	Sure, why not?
10147472	10148393	Yes, dishes.
10148433	10149473	Sure, give us an example.
10149573	10149913	Why not?
10149953	10151374	The listeners are already scared as it is.
10151954	10158336	You know, like the normals, suck my cock, you know, stick your tongue up my ass, you know, stuff like that.
10159677	10163919	But, you know, you don't want to say something that's actually, you know, somewhat...
10165644	10168906	I got limp.
10172688	10176250	It's very difficult for me to talk about something like that during sex.
10176610	10179772	And so I, you know, fuck you to that.
10180573	10180913	To him.
10184715	10186035	And we are done.
10187456	10188557	Actually, we're not, Extover.
10188577	10189898	We have to get to the chatroom FUs.
10190658	10191678	Oh, okay.
10191699	10193700	But we're done with the Extover show for now.
10193720	10194000	All right.
10194240	10194460	All right.
10196837	10198918	By the way, our chat room, have a good time laughing at that.
10199118	10210302	Good job, X. Uh, NintendoManiac64, F you, Loki, for stealing my line, which is because I can.
10211322	10216064	F you to my laptop, for not only having a cracked screen, but for the screen not even coming on now.
10216764	10221425	F you, Orange Lounge Radio talk show people, for having times that keep us east coasters up to 1230 AM.
10221445	10223346	Oh, yeah, sorry.
10223466	10225647	That's your own fucking fault for not living in the right time zone.
10226323	10233327	And plus, you know, we have to go to church before this show's on, so... F you to Homework for existing.
10233487	10234487	Is that that church with beer?
10234627	10234887	Shut up.
10235087	10240150	F you, Windows Media Player, for not supporting formats such as MPG, MOV, MP4, RM, etc.
10241311	10243832	F you to my school for actually sending my report card out.
10246909	10256013	Dark Knight says, my FU goes to bosses who ask people stupid questions when it comes to work, i.e., your credit app performance is bad, how do you look at yourself in the morning, type questions.
10257153	10265336	Ron Chan says, a massive giant FU to the catty bitches on the line that tried to get people kicked off the line and cried at Nintendo World to meet Miyamoto.
10265636	10266657	Please shut the fuck up.
10266997	10270238	If you tried to pull that, I would have grabbed you by your hair and chucked you into the street.
10270338	10271579	Welcome to New York, bitches.
10273610	10277392	Jaded's Angel says, F you to everyone for not posting comments in my live journal.
10279093	10285177	Sakurina says, F you to my parents not letting me spend my hard-earned money on any Japanese imports.
10285417	10288478	F you to Quebec Law making all Bomani but Ultramix 2 illegal.
10289159	10292101	F you to Japan Post for not sending my friend his PowerBook today.
10292601	10297464	F you to batteries dying when I'm pulling off the best damn score on pole position on the Ms.

10299685	10301546	Also, F you to forgetting my drama homework.
10302563	10304064	How do you have homework in drama?
10304885	10305405	It's Quebec.
10306286	10307307	Oh, okay.
10309489	10323240	Spiritsnare says, a big F you to V for being V. Another F you to Beatmania US for not admitting that it has V. And last F you to Tran, only because she's in V. Misty says, fuck cage match.
10323360	10325582	I didn't vote for V, I voted for the Zonk one.
10325942	10329305	Fuck being off on Sunday and not having any good F yous besides cage match.
10330899	10357015	DarkTetsuya says F you to Konami slash KCEH for putting Rainbow Flyer on Ultramix Zaku says F you to my meal plan at school since it has screwed me over in so many levels so far F you to my new kickass 13 inch LCD TV for having a dead slash stuck pixel a day after I bought it Sounds like my PSP F you to my school's cable TV in the form of DirecTV and Dish Network feeds for having channels with frozen pictures
10360356	10368819	Tomokun says, fuck this next week of school, fuck Community Day, fuck HD DVD, fuck the new Best Buy being a tiny Best Buy, fuck not affording games.
10369680	10378283	ColorofSakura says, F you to the fact that Live365 keeps crashing on me, F you to the fact that my copies of DDR3rd, 4th, and 5th Mix are taking forever to come in the mail.
10379201	10408697	Goggle says F you to Hartwick College for calling me at home all the time despite me telling them I don't want to go there GS191 says F you to the arcade manager for accusing me of breaking the in the groove machine start taking care of your own machines you fat shit eating bastard F you to the fucking old lady that put a dent into my car and tells me that it's my fault fuck you you old hag fucking bitch and lastly Johnfield says F you to my school for throttling BitTorrent and forcing me to download stuff on dial up
10411757	10412958	Shit, that was a lot of FUs.
10412998	10414619	You people are angsty as hell tonight.
10415340	10415640	Alright.
10417141	10418202	So, there it is.
10418802	10419743	Your FUs of the week.
10420383	10422204	Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.
10422825	10424806	Loki, what's on your mind?
10426347	10427828	I'm tired of the cheese.
10428529	10430610	I kind of want to eat the rest of it, but it's getting even harder.
10432391	10433132	But there's not much left.
10433312	10434653	You remember how much it came in with?
10435374	10436274	That is all that's left.
10437175	10438776	Did you have the whole brick when you came in here?
10439281	10439922	I had half of it.
10440062	10442124	Are you worried about having a heart bypass when you're 30?
10442304	10442404	No.
10442985	10445127	I'm just curious.
10445547	10446448	Are you 25 yet?
10447589	10447869	Yes.
10448670	10450432	Okay, then you don't have to wait until 25 for that.
10450832	10451393	He just turned 25.
10451433	10452654	That's right.
10453194	10454335	His birthday is September 11th.
10455797	10456297	Lucky guy.
10457098	10459100	All right, well, damn, I'm out of topics.
10459480	10460101	Let me scan.
10461342	10463584	I'm sure I missed something here on OrangeLongerator.com.
10463804	10464485	Give me a moment here.
10466420	10466921	Ask Orange Lounge.
10466941	10467882	We've only got five minutes left.
10468502	10471065	Okay, if we get a couple quick questions, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.
10471465	10474949	Hurry up and send a question over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
10475369	10476350	Oh, I wanted to add this.
10476410	10477712	I guess we can throw this out there.
10477752	10479053	We have a MySpace now.
10479393	10480635	I guess we can promote this, right?
10480735	10481055	Why not?
10481536	10482897	Yeah, I was going to do it.
10483257	10484959	Well, Terry's going to turn it over to you, right?
10485300	10485620	Or something.
10485820	10486541	He said he would, so...
10487515	10500303	We are actually discontinuing, for those of you guys that are in our 1UP club, due to lack of activity and the fact that we're going to actually be leaving, or at least I'm going to be leaving my blog on 1UP.com for another project pretty soon.
10500884	10504086	No disrespect to the folks there, but we're going to discontinue our club there.
10504106	10504986	I've never used mine.
10505287	10507488	Yeah, so we're discontinuing our club at 1UP.com.
10507888	10509669	Instead, now we have a MySpace.
10511030	10515053	And MySpace, I know we've joked about sometimes, is where the internet goes to die.
10515073	10515153	Yeah.
10515760	10518521	Your sister's Myspace Your sister's Myspace
10537540	10540702	We actually have a brand new club on Myspace.
10540742	10542022	I'm just trying to find the URL.
10542062	10546544	I think it's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge, but I'm just kind of trying to make sure of that here.
10549486	10549786	Shoot.
10550386	10550707	There we go.
10550727	10555569	Yes, it's groups.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.
10555589	10560211	So if you're a Myspace whore, like the rest of us, you can actually join our club on Myspace.
10560591	10565474	And I don't know what we're going to do with the Myspace club, but we'll do clubby things.
10567560	10571391	We'll go and drink a lot and listen to Blur.
10574935	10575956	I like the baby seal clubs.
10577137	10579319	We'll club you, actually, if you join this club.
10579499	10579939	Oh, cool.
10579979	10584163	Well, maybe do a special giveaway for the club or something, but we want to have a MySpace page.
10584543	10592210	Actually, something we thought about is maybe we actually should have an actual artist page so we can put songs on it, and it could be clips of the show or something.
10592610	10593831	So we thought about doing that, too.
10593911	10596013	So maybe, DarkSakura, you can work on that one.
10596033	10596313	That's so cool.
10596373	10597094	Work on that end of it.
10597855	10598155	Maybe.
10598415	10598595	Maybe.
10598755	10601458	And, of course, I have my Loki Fusion page on MySpace.
10602492	10602952	Yes, you do.
10603392	10604733	Hort that out because it's been a little while.
10605073	10606753	MySpace.com slash LokiFusion.
10607054	10609714	And I need to add some more stuff to it.
10609934	10610935	I have a couple songs on there.
10611875	10617577	But some stuff that you might not be able to find or, you know, because a lot of my MP3s are out there, but it's hard to find them now.
10617637	10619578	So they're up there, some of them.
10620918	10623399	All right, we're actually getting some questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
10623439	10629681	We don't have much time left in the show, so we're going to go ahead and get into these questions so we can wrap this shit up.
10637895	10640796	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10641296	10644598	What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
10645098	10651961	I hope if you had a question, you already sent it in because I'm cutting the rest of you off because we're going to be over time.
10652821	10653222	All right.
10655663	10655983	Rini.
10657461	10657941	Strong Jaeger?
10679002	10686569	I could probably ask somebody and probably find out, but I don't think that they'd appreciate me sharing that information right now.
10688551	10689512	I think it was a Strong Yeager.
10689572	10690813	I think it's something LED.
10690893	10691774	Maybe it's like Big Voyager.
10692575	10692855	Could be.
10696018	10698821	Garrett says he's heard Strong Yeager in there, definitely.
10700703	10703125	I thought you guys said Denton J was in there, and then I thought they were like...
10703823	10706164	mashing it all up with something else, but I thought I heard the bass from that in there.
10706364	10717869	I thought the two things that were in there were, because someone was saying there's five tracks, and it was 250 BPM, theme from Dungeon J, Love Me Do, Outer Limits, and then another remix of Love Me Do was my guess.
10718750	10719830	Not in exactly that order.
10719990	10720310	All right.
10720991	10722231	Well, we'll see.
10723272	10724952	Anyway, we've got to get to some other questions here.
10725333	10729054	Rini's second question, what would you do for a Klondike bar?
10730315	10730515	Eat it.
10731892	10733717	No, what would you do for a Klondike bar?
10733757	10735362	You can't eat it until you've done something for it.
10735442	10737488	I would eat another Klondike bar.
10737950	10739293	I wouldn't eat a Klondike bar.
10742742	10743062	That's it!
10743122	10744663	I gotta go buy Klonic bars now!
10744743	10745623	Thank you very much!
10746104	10748745	Legend of Zaku says, I have an LCD TV now.
10748865	10750385	I need some cool shit to do with it.
10751146	10752166	Um... Kill it!
10752787	10753807	Give it to me!
10753967	10755288	Play it and put a spoiler on it.
10755368	10756348	Play Atari 2600 on it.
10757449	10762351	Sakurina says, what does the Poppin' Music whore think of the new Bomani logo on Poppin' 13?
10764012	10765432	Um, I have no idea really.
10766433	10766753	I don't know.
10766853	10768774	I think the interface looks like shit in Poppin' Music 13.
10770253	10774615	NintendoManiac64 says, Why do you like to deprive us Easterners of sleep?
10775855	10776756	That's your own fucking fault.
10777956	10782538	In all seriousness... Why do they like to deprive us of our morning here?
10782698	10792202	Yeah, if we did the show any earlier, we'd be cutting into the rest of our weekend, so we really can't... There's just... You're screwed, I'm sorry.
10792422	10796723	I really wish I had some better news for you, but... No, you're not screwed.
10796803	10797744	There's actually a way...
10799904	10802765	You can actually, they have like a thing for streaming media where it's like TiVo.
10803185	10804186	Yeah, TiVo this show.
10804286	10811088	Figure a way, I'm sure somebody like, somebody in our chat room that knows about those things, like John Fields comes to mind, I think he knows something about that.
10812569	10812929	And the rewinds.
10812949	10814390	Probably Misty has something like this too.
10814430	10815210	Rewinds are available.
10815930	10816771	I'm not sure when they do them.
10817131	10817751	On Freak.
10818111	10819151	Yeah, on Fridays.
10821132	10825834	NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, why doesn't my Pneuma MP3 work in WMP?
10826494	10828435	It doesn't want to play that song because it's Horde.
10836909	10843655	John Field says, given your recent issues with show timing, are there any considerations of expanding the show another half an hour to an hour?
10845097	10847599	Only if you'd like to wake up and do my job for me in the morning.
10848360	10851163	I don't know if that's...
10852382	10857425	He might be talking about Orange Lounge To Go, because Orange Lounge To Go is supposed to be 30 minutes, but it's been going an hour.
10858306	10861028	Orange Lounge To Go goes however long we feel like, basically.
10861928	10862689	But this one, no.
10862949	10863229	No way.
10863930	10868693	This particular show, no, because we taped the podcast right after this show, so there's no way we could expand the show.
10868733	10872035	In fact, if anything, we'd want to cut back this show to make our podcast longer.
10873756	10875757	But we're not going to do that anytime soon.
10876297	10877158	No plans at this time.
10879889	10883172	Tomokun says, Blu-ray or HD DVD?
10883712	10889016	I want them both to come up with something that's standard so both work because I don't want to buy two players, period.
10890136	10890497	That's it.
10892038	10893239	Toshiba's making one of both.
10893499	10893739	Good.
10895300	10898282	And lastly, Illusion wants to ask, where's Waldo?
10899963	10900423	In Quebec.
10903486	10904586	Having sex with Extover?
10904666	10905007	I don't know.
10905847	10907068	Hiding in a bunker in Iraq.
10909298	10911939	That's the end of the show, boys and girls.
10912859	10913799	Final thought time.
10914600	10915820	Extifer, your final thought.
10917341	10918441	Why's it gotta be me?
10919281	10920401	Garrett, your final thought.
10921922	10922382	Garrett?
10923282	10924363	I don't have a final thought.
10924403	10925083	I'm thoughtless.
10925503	10926083	Thanks for coming.
10926603	10927124	You're welcome.
10927864	10929624	That's not what he said.
10930545	10931865	He didn't say thanks for coming.
10933125	10934146	Bugged, your final thought.

11260492	11264274	Chatroom is incessantly asking where they can download the V-Remix.
11264374	11265494	Can they download that anywhere?
11265534	11268036	Do they have to buy the diverse thing?
11270137	11273078	Well, if Alt-Ctrl-Delete was still up.
11273978	11278621	They're having bandwidth issues right now, but it would be if there was a torrent on Alt-Ctrl-Delete.com.
11278641	11280722	They have a whole diverse systems folder.
11281162	11282683	But that would be where you'd find it.
11284223	11285984	But until they come back, no.
11286424	11286745	I don't know.
11287445	11287685	All right.
