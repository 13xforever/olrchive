269900	270540	Is this thing on?
271498	274499	We'll know I'm all tangled up under all those other masses of cords.
274519	275459	Well, what else is new?
276079	277299	This is a nerd lair.
277339	278339	There's cords everywhere.
278400	278920	Get used to it.
281140	282660	Oh yeah, you guys are on wireless tonight.
283441	288502	After last week's episode, Bugged finally just brought a... He actually... You went out and bought a wireless router.
290022	291122	But he's not donating it to his suit.
291142	291682	You gotta... Here.
293783	294063	Loki.
294263	295423	Loki, give him the mic for a minute.
297343	299464	Yes, Bugged actually went out and bought a wireless router.
299504	300304	But it's going home with me.
300856	301596	If you want the old one.
302276	303297	You have an old wireless router?
303377	303557	Yes.
304577	305537	Heck, maybe I'll take it.
305657	306157	I need one.
306477	307798	I can get back on Xbox Live.
307858	308698	Yes, you could.
308718	309758	I can get back on Xbox Live.
310478	310658	Good.
310718	312499	You can get that thing that Straight Garrett has.
312839	313039	Maybe.
313219	313439	All right.
313659	314859	I haven't introduced you yet, so shut up.
315239	315499	All right.
316739	317660	Also joining us tonight.
317760	319640	Hey, we're still in the middle of my intro.
319660	320260	Thank you.
320300	320640	Sorry.
320940	322761	What else do you want to intro with tonight?
327262	328162	Usually I thought that was my...
328874	331156	Yeah, usually that's your ass, but today it's her mouth.
331256	335719	Alright, say hello to the one and only Loki, Techmaster, yadda yadda.
336440	336760	Hello.
337060	337481	How are you?
338201	338562	I'm good.
339482	340443	I'm almost done with the movie.
340964	341244	Almost.
341324	342144	I have about half an hour left.
342184	342705	The movie, yes.
342965	348589	You know, I gotta... There was a question posted in our podcast forum, but I think I'm gonna answer it on the live show tonight.
348750	355155	We're gonna do a little bit of forum feedback tonight on the live show, because I have a question I'm dying to ask you that was posted on the forums this week.
355575	358077	So, we'll get to that a little later in the show.
359324	360184	Okay, alright.
360724	364506	I was just thinking about that in regards to your rampant piracy.
366746	369727	I downloaded Advent Children in Spanish by accident.
372208	372408	Oye!
373388	373868	Okay.
378269	379250	I don't know why that's so funny.
379310	379610	It is.
383311	383651	Alright.
385290	390211	Also joining us tonight, say hello to special guest, he already opened his mouth, but once again, say hello to Bugged.
390471	390791	Hello.
391211	391691	You're back.
391952	392192	Yes.
392432	394192	And the specialist guest of them all.
396132	396452	Okay.
396532	405914	He's almost like, he's not, I mean, we already have a Techmasa Loki, but Bugged's kind of a tech guy too, so I don't know what we can call him.
406555	408595	I don't know, he's Techmasa 2 or something, I don't know.
410185	414068	DietTechMassa, I don't know, MacWhore, MacWhore, I like that.
414528	417570	They said, I know bigger MacWhores than Bugged.
418011	422514	Yes, but how many MacWhores have a G4 motherboard laying in the middle of their living room right now?
422834	428738	I remember, you, sir, used to have a, well, you still do, you have a web server that hangs from the ceiling, right?
428798	430419	No, actually, it's inside of a rolling rack.
430520	431120	It's still hanging.
431460	432761	Oh, it used to hang from the ceiling.
432881	434002	It did hang from the ceiling, yes.
434022	434583	It's pretty awesome.
434623	440507	I used to go like, hey, the old Sacramento Bomani player site used to be hosted on Neil's ceiling.
440928	441068	Yep.
441088	441628	Pretty awesome.
442989	447673	Yeah, that got moved into the inside of a wire rack, so it was zip-tied between layers of wire rack.
447853	448454	Zip ties.
449154	450676	Zip ties is better.
450696	452037	The second best thing next to duct tape.
452397	455479	Duct tape and, what was it, duct tape and weed whacker line, that's what I had available.
456520	457861	It was really strange.
458702	459142	Alright.
460123	460984	Were you a Boy Scout?
461727	462587	No, my brother was.
462788	463408	I'm just curious.
463508	463808	Alright.
464068	465469	I bet you watched lots of MacGyver.
466809	467650	Who says I ever stopped?
468990	470591	Don't they show reruns of MacGyver still?
470651	472352	Two a day.
472632	473953	Not that my TiVo doesn't get both.
474373	478735	On Megumi's journal, and I know none of you people know who that is, but she's one of... Is she in Step Squad?
479515	479996	Okay, she is.
480076	480896	Megumi's in Step Squad.
481176	484438	She posts something MacGyver in her journal like every week.
484738	486839	Just to remind me that yes, MacGyver is still cool.
488462	488922	So I don't know.
488942	489843	I don't know why I thought that out.
489863	493645	Okay, if I want my dose of Richard Dean Anderson, though, I've been going back and watching Stargate, so I'm happy.
493825	494225	Whatever.
495366	495826	Nerds!
497247	498728	Loki actually says that at my front door.
500089	501609	Ow, the MacGyver was such a hippie.
502890	503370	He was!
503430	504751	He was a fucking tree hugger!
505051	507433	But he was the most ingenious tree hugger there was.
508153	509914	So, um, gotta give him props for that.
510274	512576	But he would cut down a tree and then make paper out of it.
512736	515357	They should just put MacGyver in Stargate.
515397	516518	Just make him a character.
517091	519752	And I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, we can't get the Stargate working.
519792	528073	Well, like, give me a paperclip and I'll... The Syfy Network needs to just bring back all the cool 80s shows, like MacGyver, Quantum Leap, Holla.
528434	528954	Airwolf!
529474	529954	Airwolf.
530634	532134	Quantum Leap's on every night at 4am.
532815	533715	Oh, it's so badass.
533775	534915	Alright, anyway, let's start a show.
534955	535715	Let's talk about some games.
535995	543017	We'll be back after this quick break, featuring, uh, starting off a brand new track from the, um, V-Rare, the EX2 V-Rare.
543497	543617	It's...
543962	544963	You gotta move it!
545963	546344	Enjoy.
546644	547404	We'll be back after this.
637273	640457	Let the music fill your cell Let your body take control
711628	712390	Thanks for watching!
900426	901333	Thanks for watching!
962694	965875	After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.
966155	968235	No!
968435	969095	Just kidding.
969535	970576	Orange Lounge Radio.
970656	972236	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
972676	975897	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 156.
976117	980038	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to this train wreck of a program.
980518	982018	We do appreciate your support.
983058	987219	Especially when our show is very, very good, as well as when our show is very, very bad.
987499	988479	We appreciate your support.
988819	989399	We're never bad.
989599	992320	And shows like tonight, which are destined to be very, very mediocre.
992705	993245	We're never bad.
994906	995866	We're never mediocre.
996106	997027	We're baddest and good.
997147	998787	You know, like, the Power Glove.
998907	999528	So bad.
1000288	1000888	You know, like that.
1001348	1002789	We're fabulous, as always.
1003489	1003989	That's right.
1004389	1005750	With the power of Fiji water.
1007811	1008771	What is up with Fiji water?
1008791	1009691	It's like everywhere now.
1009751	1011492	Like, it used to be, like, I never saw Fiji water anywhere.
1011512	1012612	It's the only water that doesn't suck.
1013473	1017194	I like... Well, I actually don't like this Arrowhead stuff I've been drinking lately.
1017254	1018595	That stuff tastes like piss.
1018675	1020555	I don't like this Arrowhead drinking water.
1020856	1021916	And people go, like...
1022799	1025941	Dude, first off, you buy bottled water.
1026021	1026861	What's wrong with you?
1026961	1028322	It's like the first thing I hear.
1028402	1029263	And then it's like, no, no, no.
1029623	1030183	You don't understand.
1030223	1033525	There really is a difference between all these different brands of bottled water.
1033665	1034546	And you can taste it.
1034606	1035066	You can.
1035887	1040709	If you drink a lot of water, like I do, I drink a shootload of water.
1040729	1042390	I don't know why I'm censoring myself tonight.
1042450	1044091	A shootload of water.
1044131	1045772	You could say shitload.
1046233	1046633	I could.
1046713	1047513	I could say shitload.
1047553	1048094	It's the internet.
1048134	1049314	But tonight I'm censoring myself.
1049354	1051956	A shootload of a poo load of water.
1053115	1055516	of water every day at work.
1055836	1063037	Because my job, my day job, I don't talk about my day job a whole lot on this program, but my day job is that I'm a teacher, basically.
1063077	1066178	I don't teach kids, but I teach adults in a professional environment.
1066198	1066858	I'm a corporate teacher.
1066878	1067858	Which is almost the same thing.
1068438	1069198	Sometimes.
1069658	1070719	I'm not going to knock my job.
1070779	1077460	I love my job, but let's just say that there's challenges that come with teaching children, and there's challenges that come with teaching adults.
1079400	1081581	I'm a corporate trainer, so I do a lot of talking.
1081701	1082721	Pretty much eight hours a day
1083243	1084184	minus lunch and breaks.
1084764	1088607	So, you know, I have to drink a lot of water or my voice goes.
1088687	1090949	During lunches and breaks, Rob duct tapes his mouth shut.
1092110	1095252	I seriously try not to talk during lunches and breaks to give myself a rest.
1095752	1099635	And I just drink tons and tons of water because that's the only way I can prevent my voice from going out.
1099975	1103158	I should drink more tea, but I can only stand to drink so much tea.
1103518	1105520	And my favorite... Tea is dehydrating.
1106620	1106861	Is it?
1107541	1107721	Yep.
1107941	1108802	But it's good for your throat.
1109605	1113609	Hot Tea, but that's like if you already have like sign of strangers and stuff.
1113749	1121435	See, that's the problem is that my favorite kind of tea is iced tea, and not just any kind of iced tea, but iced green tea is like my favorite kind of tea.
1121936	1124078	But you can't find that anywhere.
1124138	1130964	Like the only time I ever found iced green tea in a bottle was in New York City at a random Rite Aid at Grand Central Station.
1131264	1132705	It was the only place I've ever seen.
1135027	1135828	Did they have green tea?
1135848	1135908	Yes.
1136168	1136629	Yes.
1138766	1139367	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
1155635	1159298	instead of like green tea solids mixed with water and crap added.
1159418	1170466	Well, yeah, I know, but the one I had, it was like some type of, and I know this has got to be really exciting for listeners, but I don't care, Lipton like green tea that's diet or something, so it didn't have a lot of sugar.
1170646	1170947	Really?
1171127	1171267	Yeah.
1171307	1171947	Where'd you get it?
1172127	1173508	I got it at Food for Less.
1174209	1176511	Oh, my God, I'm so going to Food for Less later on.
1177491	1182015	The one place I've ever seen it is New York City, and I thought, oh, maybe it's an East Coast thing.
1182075	1182375	I don't know.
1182395	1183216	It's like a 24-ounce bottle.
1183776	1184136	Oh, weird.
1184677	1184917	All right.
1186257	1188619	It's bottled by Pepsi, yeah.
1188659	1189260	I'm actually surprised.
1189300	1196405	I'm actually now looking at our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and they're actually talking about green tea.
1197626	1198987	Arizona green tea, somebody brought up.
1199087	1201028	I actually don't like Arizona green tea for some reason.
1201168	1202329	I don't like that.
1203110	1204151	I didn't like Arizona tea.
1204191	1205492	That's why I neglected to mention it.
1205612	1208754	So how about video games?
1208774	1209274	Yeah, I'm sorry.
1209294	1211376	I'm glad there's tea connoisseurs in our chat room as well.
1212036	1213077	Yeah, how about video games?
1213097	1214058	You should play less of them.
1214437	1214757	You know what?
1214957	1216177	I actually... Drink more tea.
1216197	1217378	You want to know where I get my tea from?
1217558	1217758	Where?
1218498	1223339	I get it from these little bags that I brew in hot water myself and then ice it if I want it cold.
1224519	1226799	Yeah, you made me tea the other day when I was visiting.
1226939	1228180	We had some 2DX and tea.
1228780	1229240	Yes, I did.
1229360	1230540	It was like a British thing.
1230640	1231720	We had a little 2DX and tea.
1231740	1234041	No, you had some of my southern style iced tea.
1234061	1237261	Oh, it was a little bit of southern style then.
1237581	1238342	Okay, I see.
1239762	1240022	God.
1241328	1241888	How was your week?
1241908	1242409	How was your day?
1242509	1243369	How was your day?
1264761	1265661	You fell asleep?
1266081	1266962	During one of our breaks.
1267062	1271063	I don't know if you happened to notice, I was curled up sideways on the humongoid chair.
1271443	1271763	Uh-huh.
1272563	1273724	I don't remember you falling asleep.
1273764	1274624	I actually dozed off.
1275124	1276804	I remember you being really out of it, but I don't remember you.
1276824	1279625	Now, see, earlier that day, I had slept for 13 hours.
1280706	1284707	Came back from my wedding thing and just crashed and didn't get up until 3 the next day.
1286727	1288788	Well, Monday, I get up and go to work.
1289508	1292269	I go back home, go to the doctor, go to the chiropractor.
1293544	1294665	I'm exhausted.
1295185	1297746	Next day, I sleep for another 13 hours.
1297846	1298947	I'd called in, thankfully.
1299927	1302108	Got up, took a shower, sat down for a moment.
1302148	1304069	Next thing I knew, three more hours had passed.
1304129	1307490	No, four more hours had passed, and I was just waking up again.
1308911	1310952	Went to work the next day, fell asleep twice at work.
1312093	1312613	So, yeah.
1312673	1314794	You can get away with falling asleep at work?
1315114	1315614	Yep.
1315734	1316615	That's awesome.
1316895	1317275	Barely.
1318306	1320348	I tell you I was sick though, so they didn't care.
1320628	1321849	I can't fall asleep.
1322450	1328835	Everybody's looking at me, so I can't just suddenly go, okay class, you work on this exercise and I'm going to crawl under the table and take a nap.
1329355	1331117	Remember, take off the bunny ears when you go to work.
1332438	1334199	Okay.
1334219	1334900	Then they won't look at you.
1335020	1337482	That was one of the big pluses to being the boss in a warehouse.
1337502	1343267	You go out and send your minions out to do something and then go crash in the back office for a couple hours while they finish it up.
1343940	1346842	You people, you guys seriously sleep at work?
1347302	1348423	Well, if I was at work, yes.
1348443	1348783	Sometimes.
1349603	1351364	I'd take two, three, four hour lunches.
1351384	1353366	So wait, Bug, you've fallen asleep at work?
1353846	1354987	Uh, yeah, I used to work nights.
1355407	1356227	I'd sleep half the night.
1356307	1358189	DarkSakura, you've obviously fallen asleep at work.
1358849	1361130	Loki, have you ever slept, taken sleep at work?
1361150	1361891	Okay, so it's not just me.
1361911	1362771	I've never slept at work.
1362891	1364232	I've never slept at work either.
1364492	1368955	But to my credit, I've only fallen asleep at work when I was sick, and they knew that I was sick.
1369495	1370776	I'm afraid of getting caught.
1372026	1374647	My boss was 13 miles away.
1374828	1376729	I don't want to have that conversation with my boss.
1377450	1379371	If I get caught falling asleep.
1379851	1381693	Because I'm not in class every day.
1381793	1388077	So feasibly, I could easily go into the room, turn off the lights.
1388358	1389759	I do it the same way I do it at school.
1391460	1392921	We lean over with your hand over your eyes.
1394002	1394942	With your pen in your hand.
1398045	1398505	It works.
1398585	1399846	Everybody's taking notes, right?
1402324	1406827	Oh my gosh, so you've never really been caught, except the one time when you were sick?
1408028	1408768	No, I've never been caught.
1408908	1409569	I got caught once.
1410089	1411470	I'd just only done it when I was sick.
1412190	1414271	Oh my god, what happened when you got caught?
1415232	1417774	They asked me why I was asleep, I said I was asleep.
1420856	1422757	Shit happened the night before, I didn't sleep well.
1423137	1423837	I was tired?
1424198	1424658	Exactly.
1425438	1426379	Did you get written up?
1427150	1427730	I don't remember.
1427770	1429152	They fired my boss the next day.
1429192	1430593	Oh, lucky you.
1432974	1439439	Well, it was really odd because the owner of the company I work for also owned another company that we were doing contract work with.
1439459	1443022	It was like a whole big old conflict of interest shit.
1443802	1452949	It's a good old ISP JPS net, but yeah, the data center was located in downtown SAC and everyone else was up in Rockland.
1452989	1455731	I was the only person in downtown SAC and
1456260	1457701	I went into the server room and crashed out.
1459362	1463065	And then the other company brought people through on a tour and I was sitting there snoring away.
1463285	1470170	Hypothetically, in my job, I could easily, easily sneak into one of the training rooms when there's no class going on, turn off the lights, crawl on the table, and go to sleep.
1470230	1471911	And people would just think I'm somewhere else.
1472351	1475934	I could do it, but it's one of those things... Paranoia.
1476394	1476814	Exactly.
1478556	1484800	I work out of paranoia because it's one of those things where I know that the first time I ever did something like that, I'd get caught.
1485626	1485986	www.DarkSakura.com
1504685	1507926	Why aren't you afraid of somebody stealing all the money?
1508246	1511867	And they say, no, because if you have the money out like that, people assume there's a camera on it.
1511907	1515047	So it's honesty by paranoia.
1517248	1518168	And I kind of compare that.
1518388	1520168	See, Loki I see is kind of nodding his head.
1520228	1521349	Is that the same thing for you?
1521409	1523349	Is that you're afraid you're going to get caught?
1524749	1525169	I couldn't.
1525249	1529230	In the work I do, I couldn't even begin to try to fall asleep.
1529250	1531471	There's just too many people around me that would wake me up.
1531871	1532191	I have two.
1534395	1536917	I've been working for this company since 2000.
1537037	1543722	And honestly, I can count the number of times it's happened and it's all been when I was sick or had a migraine.
1554437	1556259	Migraine Surgery.
1556299	1559103	It was always my monitor that gave me my headaches.
1559143	1562427	The same reason why I can't look at a TV and your monitor would give me a headache.
1563268	1564610	Because it's got a rounded screen.
1565693	1568035	Oh, I'm actually going to replace this.
1568075	1571897	My next big purchase, I'm going to be replacing this monitor with a flat screen, so be nice.
1571977	1577441	I have no reason to replace my monitor at home because it's a full-size monitor, but it's a flat screen Trinitron.
1577761	1577941	Right.
1578382	1579082	Your monitor's pretty nice.
1579102	1580003	My monitor is pretty nice.
1580083	1581764	I like Extifer's monitor, too.
1582004	1583145	His monitor wouldn't make me sick.
1583605	1583765	Right.
1584065	1584766	I understand mine.
1584886	1588088	Mine's kind of a weird monitor, but I can't complain because my monitor was free.
1588288	1588708	Thank you, Bugged.
1589009	1589269	Thank you.
1589629	1591050	Appreciate it.
1591170	1592491	Does it still have the green stripes on the top?
1593454	1594935	Dan brought home another MMORPG.
1594955	1597317	And he brought home some, like, he brought home Ico.
1623988	1627611	Which I never remembered him liking that game, but he said that he wanted to play it.
1629653	1633336	And I went to Ikea yesterday with my friend Tia.
1633536	1633996	You know Tia.
1634417	1635157	Of course I know Tia.
1635197	1635658	She's a doll.
1637219	1642443	I had owed her a birthday present, so I just took her to Ikea and got her, like, a bunch of stuff for her house.
1643884	1644585	And her new kitty?
1645446	1645626	Huh?
1646086	1646727	And her new kitty?
1648908	1649689	Oh, that's right.
1649709	1650289	She has a cat now.
1650710	1650790	Oh.
1652133	1653474	I didn't remember about the cat.
1654915	1659858	But we went and picked up my friend Krista, who lives in Berkeley.
1661279	1664141	And we ate really good Indian food.
1665282	1669785	Went down to Ikea, had meatballs, bought stuff, came back.
1670665	1673647	Did anybody go, that's a spicy meatball?
1673667	1675789	These are Swedish meatballs.
1675829	1677170	Yeah, Swedish, not Italian.
1677410	1677730	Sorry.
1678871	1679912	There was no Mario.
1679932	1680312	No Mario.
1682358	1703473	and then we went to get gelato at this one place in Berkeley that's like got a bajillion flavors I love it's like Naya or something there's a gelato place right by Ikea that is awesome we just went to Berkeley they had like a billion they had like fig flavor and they had amaretto and all kinds of liquor flavors they had aloe vera flavored aloe vera flavored?
1703493	1704874	it was actually supposed to be pretty good
1706125	1707465	I don't want to rub it on my sunburn.
1709067	1711448	Well, aloe vera is actually really good for your digestion.
1712389	1717332	But I had whole grain flavor, which was really yummy.
1717372	1718733	It tasted like cereal and milk.
1721375	1726138	I had this like milk flavor with dark chocolate sprinkles in it.
1726919	1729301	Or not sprinkles, but like swivels in it, but it was all hard.
1730061	1734004	And amaretto, which had real amaretto in it, which was so yummy.
1735064	1736866	and, uh, drove back.
1737266	1741190	And we watched Ring 2 last night, the US one, which is, um, yeah.
1741750	1751498	And, um, and then I installed the MMORPG today after doing my Illustrator homework, which I will show the chatroom what I did because I'm so proud that I finally got the freaking pencil right.
1752639	1756623	Um, but I, uh, got an MMORPG today and installed it and played it.
1757223	1757704	Pretty cool.
1757864	1759085	So we're going to save that for a little later?
1760086	1762448	I don't see what's the big deal, but I'm going to let the chatroom guess...
1764423	1766124	All of them are on my friends list in LiveJournal.
1788300	1791603	and picked that up and then sold back a bunch of games on Wednesday and picked up Burnout 4.
1792584	1795546	Had a couple bucks left over and also picked up Nintendogs.
1795686	1799630	And then I found out that my DS's sound system is completely dead.
1800010	1800531	Oh no.
1800651	1802292	So I've never heard my dog, but it hears me.
1804314	1805134	So it's a mute dog.
1805215	1805995	It's a mute dog.
1806416	1806856	That's nice.
1807717	1809058	Now, just a follow-up to last week's show.
1809078	1811640	For those of you guys that weren't listening last week, there was this big thing.
1812000	1813642	Somebody had called us on Skype.
1813702	1813962	Was it
1814778	1823863	Ron Chan, I think, called us on Skype and said that he had heard something on the internet that there was a Target in some area that was selling We Heart Katamari early.
1823943	1825463	So I don't know where this idea came from.
1825503	1827744	We just said, well, because it was going back and forth.
1827784	1829745	Like, oh, no, it's a Photoshop.
1829826	1830946	Or, yeah, they were selling it early.
1830986	1834208	So we said, well, just freaking call them and see if they have one in stock.
1834248	1842812	And sure enough, when we called them, we all were kind of, at least I know when I was calling them, I was expecting the guy to say, no, we don't have that game or to know nothing about it.
1843206	1847549	But we kind of got surprised because when we called the Target and asked the guy, he said, yeah, there's one left on the shelf.
1848050	1852593	So that kind of started this whole like, oh, shit, wave of, oh, shit, call Target.
1852633	1853353	What the hell is going on?
1854074	1858537	So sure enough, Bug, you had, now you found a copy of We Heart Katamari in the air.
1858557	1858917	And bought it.
1859518	1864361	And I went to, now one of the Target stores you called on break was the one in Roseville.
1864501	1864661	Right.
1864822	1866143	Not that far from Golf Land.
1866303	1866563	Right.
1867550	1876655	I actually went out there Tuesday and asked if they had any We Heart Katamari because I didn't see any on the shelf and I asked because they said when you called them they were going to put them out on the shelves that Tuesday, right?
1876755	1877095	They didn't.
1877776	1879877	And the guy said, no, we don't have that game.
1880077	1882098	Almost he knew what I was trying to do.
1882558	1890122	So I think some of the Target employees caught on because somehow there was this whole underground wave on the internet like, check Target, check Target.
1890662	1892683	None of the major gaming sites picked this up.
1892923	1895725	None of them picked it up that We Heart Katamari got leaked early.
1896331	1901452	But somehow it was spreading on the down low, and I'd like to think we had something to do with that.
1901492	1901753	Loki?
1902333	1905554	Yeah, you see, here's what happened with the whole Tuesday thing.
1906674	1910755	Apparently, what happened was Namco accidentally, one of the shipments, got sent out.
1911575	1917477	They knew who exactly, too, that those got shipped to, and so when they found out,
1918154	1922397	Thanks to me, Mr. Snitch, that stores had leaked it.
1922917	1927400	They got on the phone and they reprimanded people.
1928341	1928761	Really?
1928821	1931543	Now, this was an email that you wrote to Namco.
1931583	1933244	The head of sales from Namco.
1933264	1936847	So, thank you for ruining our fun, you bastard.
1936907	1939668	It's only a couple copies that were leaked.
1939889	1941890	Probably everyone already bought those copies.
1941950	1944031	I mean, we're talking like one shipment, one box.
1944212	1944232	I...
1945373	1946594	I think Namco downplayed it too.
1963123	1967446	There was another one in the center of the country, another one on the east coast.
1967606	1968687	Yeah, we know there was one in Kansas.
1968707	1973330	Speculate what you want, but this is straight from the head of sales at Namco.
1973650	1975432	Of course, we all know corporations are full of bullshit.
1975512	1978514	I understand that, but I think they were BSing you in your first response.
1978574	1980435	I think that they were trying to downplay what happened.
1980455	1981096	Yeah, guess what?
1981156	1983998	They actually released some more games that haven't even come out yet.
1984038	1986239	Namco X Capcom is in stores right now.
1986459	1986760	Is it?
1987240	1987900	No, it's not.
1988441	1989001	Bastard.
1989662	1990222	I'm just saying.
1994473	1999096	They may say whatever they want to, but we've got irrefutable proof that they lied.
2000957	2002058	Chat room comments.
2002838	2003218	Let's see.
2003298	2004219	Comments about Loki.
2004339	2005440	Loki, you fucking narc.
2005820	2006841	Snitch, you whore.
2007281	2008582	You're a mean one, Mr. Snitch.
2008662	2009722	You piece of shit, Loki.
2009762	2010723	You ruined Christmas.
2011063	2011924	You whore, slut.
2011944	2012744	You ruined Hanukkah.
2012984	2013765	Honky-ass bitch.
2015026	2016527	It ruined shit, okay?
2016587	2017408	Let me put it this way.
2017828	2021871	If those games would have been on the store shelves anyways, then they would have already been bought up, okay?
2022351	2024512	And if they weren't already, then you know what?
2024913	2028035	Don't blame me, because it's those retarded people who put it out in the first place.
2028995	2031337	You shouldn't even have your game yet, so shut up.
2031837	2032838	That's what I have to say about that.
2033613	2036514	And a related note, I actually got to play We Heart Katamari today, thank you guys.
2036554	2040734	If you really want your stupid game early, go fucking pirate it off the internet like everybody else does.
2041174	2042155	And save yourself the $40.
2042715	2052156	That's what it's really about, is that you don't want people stepping on your territory of the rampant BitTorrent piracy ring or whatever.
2052437	2053777	BitTorrent was last week, man.
2054397	2056337	It's all about newsgroups.
2056717	2059318	Newsgroups are older than old and never went away.
2062359	2063420	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2076680	2078161	We played it at E3.
2078801	2080022	I know, and the E3 one rocked.
2080062	2085185	But here's my thing, is that I don't understand Japanese at all, and I'm not going to learn it.
2085305	2086966	So I need an English version.
2086986	2090248	I know 30 kanji, which isn't enough to read all the dialogue in that game.
2091108	2092369	So it doesn't matter.
2092449	2099993	The king of all cosmos is going to say something fabulous, his package is going to rule the world, and you're going to roll a bunch of shit up in a big ball, big whoop.
2100053	2100474	What's new?
2102035	2102295	Fine.
2102615	2104436	Besides, Burnout 4 came out, and that was...
2105265	2107986	Alright, I want to let Bugged finish what was going on with his week.
2108027	2110448	However, I do want to end on one note here.
2110708	2115530	Legend of Zaku says, Remember Loki, snitches get stitches for being bitches.
2116551	2117231	Just remember that.
2119513	2121013	Bugged, how was the rest of your week?
2121634	2122774	Burnout 4 is also awesome.
2125536	2127257	And that was pretty much my damn week.
2129078	2130518	Alright, Loki, how was your week?
2130558	2131199	How was your day?
2131979	2133160	My week started off good.
2133180	2133220	Um,
2134625	2143310	Well, first off, I had, you know, Advent Children, like, the hour after the show ended.
2144591	2145372	I had to watch it.
2146269	2148690	Actually, I had to watch it, but I didn't get to watch it.
2148810	2152111	Instead, I watched most of the action sequences over the course of the week.
2152251	2155613	Until Wednesday, and that's when I got Burnout Revenge.
2156693	2159954	And then we just crashed into cars the rest of the week.
2160755	2164616	And then I finally got to watch Advent Children today, the entire thing.
2164796	2167798	And I don't know why Sony is not putting this in theaters.
2169038	2172259	It's like 100% better than a lot of this shit out there.
2172740	2173700	Even though it has no plot?
2174471	2175871	and Spirits Within.
2175891	2179253	It has a plot and if you pay attention to the plot you would know that.
2180453	2189436	No, I watched the whole thing all the way through the first time I watched it and actually could follow the dialogue without subtitles and the plot was so weak you could see right through it.
2192057	2192477	Okay.
2194017	2195758	Miss Bitter, just call her a bitch.
2196960	2197840	Fucking bitch!
2198900	2199881	Now call him a bastard.
2199901	2202481	Call him a fucking asshole, come on.
2202601	2204342	Hey, you stop it there!
2205462	2207102	Well, I like to think that I'm an adult, thank you.
2209343	2211543	Well, I'm not, so I'll stoop that low now.
2212063	2214244	Anyways, no, it was actually really kickass.
2215404	2218565	Plot or not, I mean, come on, it's better than ooey bullshit.
2219025	2219245	I mean...
2220647	2221548	Loki does have a point.
2221708	2223069	At least it didn't have a rave in it.
2225370	2226431	I haven't even watched it yet.
2226471	2227792	I have to say he does have a point.
2227832	2229113	It wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.
2229873	2230133	True.
2231014	2236758	I just... Without spoiling anything, it is true.
2237178	2238019	There was a plot.
2238099	2241081	However, it was highly transparent and very obvious from the beginning.
2241801	2243903	So I don't put much merit in that.
2243983	2246364	It's eye candy and it's for the fans is all it is.
2246564	2247025	Was it pretty?
2247845	2249046	Oh, yeah, it was pretty.
2250445	2254668	and I'm going to say this off microphone real quick.
2254688	2257590	It's all about motorcycle races, okay?
2257630	2259251	Alright, okay.
2259631	2267837	But yeah, it was very, no, I'm not saying it was bad at all, but it did have a really weak plot, I'm sorry.
2268397	2270138	Which was better, Advent Children or Spirits Within?
2270158	2270759	Spirits Within.
2271718	2275859	Wolf Spirits Within, I can't really call Final Fantasy because it wasn't, number one, wasn't a game.
2276319	2277360	Number two, didn't feel like it.
2277440	2280240	It's basically, hi, this is really pretty CG by Square.
2281781	2283981	And that's what they should have called the movie, and I bet it would have done better.
2284021	2285362	And it was a good movie on its own.
2285542	2286662	It just wasn't Final Fantasy.
2286742	2287022	It was.
2287042	2288283	That was just like the bouncer.
2288363	2290043	Hi, this is a pretty game by Square.
2291904	2296325	They should have just marketed it as not a Final Fantasy movie, as, you know, pretty CG.
2296345	2297405	Just called the Spirits Within.
2297425	2297525	Alien 5.
2297645	2297925	Alien 5.
2301445	2303466	You know they're going to probably make something like that too.
2303566	2304907	Anyway, sorry, you're weak in your day.
2305387	2309250	Anyways, other than that, didn't do a whole lot.
2309370	2311511	Just trying to play some other games.
2311931	2318195	I almost got to play Graffiti Kingdom, even though I bought that like weeks ago.
2318675	2318995	Almost.
2321437	2323538	But yeah, I got a bunch of games I'm trying out.
2323698	2325899	So like Urban Rain, it's going to be sweet.
2327120	2330722	They actually have, what is it, Paul Phoenix and Law from Tekken 5 in it.
2331295	2332176	Final Fantasy XI
2354113	2358784	Oh my god, I will never play Final Fantasy XI that long again.
2359165	2362533	And Loki, you'll be pleased to know another mission was accomplished without you.
2363399	2367000	I keep trying to play, and goddammit, the woman keeps pulling me away.
2367700	2369301	But at least this time it was for a good reason.
2369321	2370721	She got her fucking car, finally.
2370941	2371461	Oh, congratulations.
2371481	2372502	I don't drive her around anymore.
2372742	2375702	I'm done driving an hour, or two hours a day.
2375802	2376583	Driving Miss Nelly?
2377163	2378023	Driving Miss Nelly.
2378223	2378603	Alright.
2378963	2380704	So, I'm done with that, thank god.
2380784	2384125	I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to Final Fantasy XI.
2384165	2385585	It's friggin' hard.
2385625	2387166	There's too much stuff I have to do.
2387806	2388686	We can still help you with it.
2389646	2397512	I want to be able to sit down Saturdays and just play, or set a day to play, but it's just not working out that way.
2398113	2401595	I can't do a marathon like that on that game ever again.
2401635	2403256	It was so exhausting.
2403797	2412363	When I was unemployed, I played Ragnarok for a total of, what was it, 38 hours straight.
2412543	2413344	Oh my lord.
2413824	2414485	No, I have some
2415031	2416052	Days off here.
2416272	2416872	I didn't sleep.
2417093	2418634	Oh my gosh, you people are sick.
2419034	2420315	I can't play a video game that long.
2420735	2424278	Although I have done several days straight staying logged in because I would vend at night.
2425759	2427460	And while I was at work, when I started working in.
2432704	2433945	So the rest of my week and my day...
2436601	2447270	Pretty much, I picked up, I'm going to talk about some of these games on the podcast, but I also picked up a copy of Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, because it was a game that I played at E3 that I liked, surprisingly, a lot more than I thought I would.
2447310	2448050	Wait, wait, wait, hold on.
2448151	2449111	You picked up that game?
2449372	2449592	Yeah.
2450993	2451373	From where?
2452774	2453155	Best Buy.
2453255	2453435	Why?
2454115	2455617	It doesn't come out until next week!
2455897	2457118	It came out early.
2457178	2459300	It's on GameStop's site as being out now, too.
2459740	2460781	Eh, fucking GameStop.
2461622	2461822	So...
2463073	2463734	Did I really get it?
2463834	2465535	I didn't get a copy of Mortal Kombat Shell amongst early.
2465555	2466696	It's out everywhere, isn't it?
2467256	2467396	No.
2467996	2468236	Really?
2468537	2469017	I don't think so.
2469257	2469757	I think so.
2470098	2470938	Look at GameStop's site.
2470958	2471919	It says it came out last week.
2472559	2473700	Well, GameStop's wrong.
2477623	2482065	Alright, well... I'll have to check into that, because... You know... Are you going to snitch on them, too?
2482085	2483346	Are you going to snitch on Best Buy now?
2483646	2488209	No, that means that our Dallas facility is wrong, and... Well, no.
2488329	2488550	No.
2489310	2490070	I don't know.
2490151	2492252	I really don't care, you know, because...
2492751	2493451	And Richard O'Brien!
2493471	2493612	Yes!
2493632	2493832	Anyway.
2522964	2524066	So, I like Mortal Kombat.
2524086	2528071	I think it's got a pretty interesting story to it, and the game's actually kind of fun, so I'm going to talk about that.
2528091	2530835	But it does have flaws, but I'll talk about that on the podcast.
2530915	2533037	Otherwise, not a whole lot else to my week.
2533198	2534039	I've been pretty boring.
2534259	2536362	I haven't done anything that special, so that's me.
2537222	2539444	Oh, by the way, I watched the movie Birth last night.
2539624	2540504	That movie sucks.
2540785	2543667	Wait, is that the one with Nicole Kidman fucking a 12-year-old or something?
2543687	2544848	She doesn't fuck a 12-year-old.
2545508	2546609	It's a 10-year-old, for one.
2546969	2547890	And she doesn't fuck him.
2548450	2551112	She does take a bath with him.
2551512	2553254	Or I should say, he gets in the bath with her.
2554114	2557096	And she kisses him, and that's about it.
2557617	2559678	But it was fucking boring.
2560099	2560919	Does it have a tongue?
2561940	2562620	I guess.
2562881	2564442	It doesn't show it.
2564922	2566103	So there's a ton of scenes with
2566812	2569174	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2591524	2591764	No.
2591784	2593045	It's just a movie with Bjork in it.
2593085	2593645	Now, don't get me wrong.
2593685	2607533	I love Bjork and I love Dance from the Dark, actually, but it's so pretentious because, like, the first four minutes of the movie is just music playing like a symphony and all just paintings dissolving into one another.
2607593	2608133	Just paintings.
2608213	2609794	Pictures of paintings for four minutes.
2610715	2612035	That's nothing to do with the movie.
2612596	2613036	Exactly.
2613056	2615077	It has nothing to do... Well, it kind of does...
2615649	2622773	You could say it does, because it's about her going blind, and so, you know, paintings get it, because, you know, when you're blind, you can't see paintings.
2624394	2624774	But anyway.
2625294	2628316	So she sings crappy music instead?
2630377	2634519	No, but there's this one thing where she's singing about everything in the factory, and she's like, Boom!
2634680	2635060	Crash!
2635140	2635640	Skitty!
2635680	2636040	Boom!
2636100	2637281	Crash!
2638562	2640663	Oh, I would throw her into a machine.
2640743	2642664	I love Bjork, because she's crazy.
2646047	2646347	All right.
2647468	2647708	Anyway.
2648028	2650669	I love Margaret Cho's impression of Bjork.
2653351	2658313	I don't know.
2658373	2660094	I can't do it.
2660194	2663456	What was that dinosaur in Jurassic Park?
2663676	2665117	Remember that killed the guy in the car?
2665157	2665837	Not the raptor.
2665857	2666797	Dilophosaurus.
2666817	2667638	Dilophosaurus.
2668820	2674103	Remember, the postman on Seinfeld was in Jurassic Park, right?
2674424	2674864	Newman!
2675064	2675384	Newman!
2675544	2676565	Newman was in Jurassic Park.
2676585	2678546	I didn't watch Seinfeld because that show was lame.
2679207	2681848	Okay, well, forget it then.
2682568	2683629	I'm talking to a wall.
2684430	2685270	Well, no, go ahead.
2686151	2687631	I just don't know who you're talking about.
2687772	2689092	Okay, there's a scene in Jurassic Park.
2689132	2692394	He was the big fat guy with the glasses that was kind of the bad guy.
2693015	2693415	The lawyer?
2693435	2693515	Yeah.
2694099	2695079	He wasn't the lawyer.
2695859	2697600	He was the computer programmer.
2697660	2699040	He took the security systems down.
2699280	2700881	I remember him.
2701121	2702701	Was Nedry, was that his name in the movie?
2702721	2703021	Yes.
2703061	2704181	Okay, his name was Nedry in the movie.
2704281	2704781	I read the book.
2704841	2706582	Okay, well, it was the same thing in the book.
2707062	2720565	And he's running away, trying to escape, and the power goes out at that point or whatever, and then the dinosaur comes up to him in the car, and it's going, and it's so cute, and he's like,
2720942	2734169	and then he's like, hi guy, go away or something and then I think he throws a rock at the dinosaur or something and the dinosaur goes and then spits on him and tears out his intestines or whatever dinosaurs do.
2734689	2735530	Ew, intestines.
2735550	2735770	Yeah.
2737370	2737991	Oh my god.
2738311	2740292	I did have to laugh when the dinosaur got in his car.
2741833	2743614	Yeah, the dinosaur like hops in his car and eats him.
2744414	2744854	It's pretty cool.
2745955	2749997	I did like the Jurassic Park 3 was horrible but it did have funny scenes in it.
2750444	2751384	I never saw Jurassic Park 3.
2752324	2753425	Like at the very end.
2753605	2756725	What about Jurassic Park 2 with the chick that does the gymnastics?
2756826	2757766	That was laughable.
2758746	2763747	But in the third one, there's a scene with the mama trying to soar in her baby.
2764507	2766428	And the guy's like trapped in the thing.
2767588	2768908	And he's like the bad guy.
2768928	2770649	So she nudges the baby.
2770709	2771189	Go ahead.
2771329	2772129	Go ahead and eat him.
2772469	2773029	Go ahead.
2773549	2775010	And the baby goes, okay, mommy.
2775130	2775610	Rawr!
2776790	2777410	That was funny.
2778291	2779831	Is it true they're making a Jurassic Park 4 movie?
2781457	2782738	I have to see them laugh at it.
2783098	2783679	It's over.
2783799	2784520	It's over, people.
2784560	2786221	No, it's on Mainland now.
2787662	2793087	That was the worst part of Jurassic Park 2, was when it was like San Diego gets invaded with Velociraptors.
2793147	2797811	Or they can find maybe another island that they didn't know about that they're doing a third Jurassic Park in.
2797831	2799712	It's like, oh, we didn't know about that one.
2801594	2805277	Or bring Jeff Goldblum back to life again.
2805417	2808600	Yeah, well, just read the book.
2810373	2811915	The book was actually really, really good.
2812976	2818722	I think Jurassic Park should be like the dinosaurs attack Euro Disney or something like that.
2820203	2821905	Battle Royale versus Jurassic Park.
2822265	2824047	Or how about that new Hong Kong Disney?
2825489	2826430	Better idea for a movie.
2826470	2829373	We'll have Tony Jai versus the dinosaurs.
2829613	2830634	We'll just have them take them out.
2830654	2831575	Can Vin Diesel be in it?
2832543	2833243	He can get eaten.
2833964	2838406	He can be like the Steven Seagal character in Executive Decision.
2838526	2839987	Is Steven Seagal still making movies?
2840487	2841168	Unfortunately, yes.
2841208	2843609	Dude, who is a Steven Seagal fan anymore?
2844849	2845350	The Midwest.
2846890	2847811	I'm serious.
2847831	2849712	Just the whole lot of them.
2849852	2850672	The whole Midwest.
2851933	2854034	They're the people that still buy the Van Damme movies.
2854534	2855975	And yes, he's still making movies.
2856816	2857716	It's all being movies now.
2857736	2859097	Guile's still making movies?
2860475	2864542	Yeah, he wasn't satisfied enough killing off fucking Raul Julia, but no!
2864563	2866486	Gotta keep making more crappy movies!
2867107	2870133	I feel so bad for Raul Julia, for that being his last movie.
2870507	2870807	I know.
2870967	2875050	Technically, he had another thing on HBO that he won a lot of awards for.
2875511	2877532	So he had that HBO thing.
2877692	2878893	Yeah, sort of the redemption thing.
2878913	2881495	If only someone could go back in time and tell him not to make that movie.
2882716	2883716	It's a bad idea.
2883836	2889440	But remember that the Street Fighter movie came out when we were all like in what, like 7th grade-ish?
2889480	2891002	I think I was in 7th grade, right?
2892342	2894804	I think it was like 1990 when that movie came out, right?
2894904	2897286	But it was like, you know, you go and see it and you're like,
2897898	2898880	What the hell is this?
2898960	2903148	I actually remembered liking it when I was younger, and I saw it four times in the theater.
2904010	2908979	Wow, I remember... I had an obsession with Jean-Claude Van Damme when I was younger.
2910086	2911267	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2933960	2939184	And then I went and saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, The Secret of the U is like the next week or something.
2939885	2941486	That movie was like, okay.
2941526	2942987	That movie had funny parts though.
2943047	2946049	That movie was like, okay, maybe, and then 3 was like, no.
2946129	2947270	And it had David Warner in it.
2948191	2949111	Street Fighter came out in 94.
2949151	2949111	94?
2949191	2949432	Yes.
2950132	2952654	The year I graduated.
2952674	2955236	I would have been a sophomore in high school.
2955896	2956897	Yeah, we both would have.
2957037	2959639	I dragged my dad to see that even though I was a sophomore in high school.
2959659	2960200	I guess so.
2961060	2961340	Wow.
2961461	2963342	I let him get my license until junior.
2964164	2967887	I was, yeah, well, I remember still being in high school when I saw it, so.
2968728	2969709	Yeah, I graduated that year.
2970429	2970769	Wow.
2971950	2972831	God, I feel old.
2972911	2973171	Anyway.
2974613	2976534	You were a sophomore and I graduated that year.
2976754	2977535	I know, I know.
2977635	2977875	What?
2978516	2979036	You feel old?
2979657	2980498	That's true, I am younger.
2980558	2981638	Yeah, so shut up.
2983320	2983540	Anyway.
2984761	2985702	Let's go to a break, shall we?
2986442	2986583	No.
2986603	2987543	I think we need to do a break.
2987563	2988184	No, I don't think so.
2988344	2989445	Sorry, Rob, no break for you.
2990248	2990848	Yep, break time.
2990868	3003434	When we come back from this break, we're going to be talking about 2DX Tent Style, the consumer version that's going to be coming out soon, because we actually have been sent some MP3s from our buddy Siggy, who calls in on the Skype line quite a bit.
3004195	3010138	He's going to call us back on Skype when we come back from the next break and talk about these brand new Tent Style consumer tracks.
3010458	3012159	It's going to be pretty sweet, so stay tuned for that.
3012539	3016941	In the meantime, we're going to go to break, and I thought in this break we could do some music from Guitadora V.
3017711	3024817	because, as you might have heard at Tokyo Game Show this week, Guitar Freaks V and Drumania V coming out for the PlayStation 2.
3025477	3028400	So, finally... More stuff to import!
3028420	3029821	Did you hear about the other thing about it?
3029841	3034965	The arcade-style controller, the ASC, is also going to be released for Guitar Freaks.
3035310	3036310	Okay, I have to tell Dan about that.
3036330	3037171	I don't know about Drum Mania.
3037291	3038011	I'll buy those.
3038211	3039132	I'll buy those guitars.
3039152	3040832	But they're doing an ASC for Guitar Freak.
3040873	3043634	If they did a Drum Mania one, you know I'd freaking have that.
3043674	3046795	I don't even know how the hell they would do an arcade-style version of that.
3047395	3047936	Easy enough.
3048056	3061962	It's going to be sweet either way, and I'm just excited because I'm hoping that they can bring back now, they can make these games, because assumably they'll do one for V2 down the line if this one's successful, and they can add so many old songs in it.
3062342	3062702	I hope.
3062782	3063623	I really hope they do it.
3063643	3065984	Well, you know, they are talking about doing this for the U.S.
3066024	3066284	too.
3066885	3067225	Really?
3067845	3068226	We'll see.
3069046	3069386	We'll see.
3070367	3072088	Maybe that'll be the big secret at next year's E3.
3072128	3072448	We'll see.
3072568	3072868	We'll see.
3073749	3074089	All right.
3074910	3076851	We'll start off with some B4U next.
3077571	3078932	B4U next is going to kick it off.
3079072	3081293	And then we're also going to have a band called Pooh in this break.
3082214	3085336	All from Aguitadora V. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

3531257	3531657	Tonight's segment
3559375	3561016	Dark Sakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week
3590748	3591268	That's right.
3591588	3592668	This is going to be... Huh?
3592908	3594068	The music's messed up.
3595229	3605191	It's a leftover from Vanilla Sky, so... Now that that show's not on anymore, we have this here, so... Anyway, so this segment is very simple because Yo Mama jokes are still funny.
3605911	3608931	DarkSakura will be reading a Yo Mama joke every week.
3609451	3613212	So, DarkSakura, what is tonight's Yo Mama joke of the week?
3613952	3615193	Are you sure you can handle it?
3616533	3617033	I think so.
3618314	3621136	Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.
3623938	3625720	Great, that's great.
3626200	3627000	That was so funny.
3627161	3629262	Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.
3629402	3630583	What's that sound I hear?
3630983	3633265	Oh yes, it's jumping the shark.
3635767	3636567	I got another one.
3638049	3638969	No, no, save it for next week.
3639189	3639910	You only get one joke a week.
3639950	3641011	I have a lot of yo mama jokes.
3641071	3641491	I know you do.
3642772	3643032	Alright.
3648166	3660437	Yeah, see, some of the old school Orange Lounge Radio listeners actually remember that being the exact same theme music we used to use on Vanilla Sky for the world's worst forward, where I would read a forwarded joke over email.
3660577	3662439	Things that actually get sent to me at work...
3663234	3670439	But the funny, the ironic thing is, I mean, we haven't been doing Vanilla Sky lately on the network just because of personal conflicts with scheduling.
3670979	3673380	And I don't get forwarded emails at work anymore.
3673861	3677063	Like they crack down on it or something, so I really don't get them anymore.
3677143	3678604	So I wouldn't have any jokes to read anyway.
3678864	3680645	So I'm glad we could recycle the theme music.
3680945	3687309	So listeners, if you have a really awesome Yo Mama joke, send them to jamie at orangezonesradio.com.
3688154	3696040	and while I'm sifting through emails from teachers and the podcast emails and everything else.
3696060	3696980	She'll have some Yo Mama jokes.
3697000	3698981	I'll have some Yo Mama jokes too to read at work.
3699021	3699602	And you know what?
3699642	3702304	Maybe once a month we could mix it up a little bit and do Yo Daddy.
3703665	3704145	Do Yo Daddy.
3704165	3705486	We're an equal opportunity show.
3705506	3707687	Yeah, we're equal opportunity offenders so we could do Yo Daddy.
3709208	3709608	Alright.
3712010	3713451	Now we got the whole chat room started.
3713731	3716213	It's going to be one of those jokes where all night long they can't stop...
3717538	3723663	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3743382	3743702	Huh?
3744203	3744583	What do you think?
3744603	3745364	The nunchucks?
3745424	3746465	The Nintendo nunchucks?
3746505	3747065	What do you think?
3747586	3748927	The butt controller?
3749047	3749568	I don't know.
3750929	3756194	It's kind of one of those things where I can't knock it until I've tried it.
3756394	3758496	I mean, bless Nintendo for doing something new.
3759356	3763100	Certainly, they're trying something new with this, but I don't know.
3763200	3767784	It's going to be kind of weird at first, but then again, if you think about it, you know, a lot of the...
3768531	3774113	The iToy was weird at first too, but of course the iToy is not that great a peripheral now, just because they don't have good games to support it.
3776393	3780714	Well, I guess maybe DDR, but even then, hands and feet modes kind of knocked on.
3781255	3784035	They have some other games that feature the iToy.
3784075	3785076	What, Antigrav?
3785336	3792097	No, they have this game DT Racer, which was a really crappy racing game that used the iToy for some reason to steer.
3792678	3797579	And they have another game, Virtua Tennis, that you can use that to play tennis as well.
3799005	3804194	All the games that feature the eye toy, though, other than DDR and stuff, they kind of suck.
3805596	3808420	Well, even those eye toy modes suck.
3808901	3809322	I know, I know.
3810784	3812807	You know, the thing, though, about the Nintendo Revolution...
3813786	3815347	The controller is not my issue.
3815587	3817028	I'm willing to try this new controller.
3817068	3817989	I think it'll be interesting.
3818049	3824092	It's different, so it gives the Nintendo something to really separate itself from Sony and Microsoft, which is kind of what it needs right now.
3824112	3825673	You know what my first complaint about it is?
3825733	3826053	What's that?
3826634	3827214	Ergonomics.
3828235	3828655	You think?
3828855	3831537	That controller is not ergonomically sound.
3833358	3840902	Seriously, hold out your hand for a moment and think about how it's going to be working a remote control for hours of gameplay.
3842443	3843224	That's why...
3844649	3852233	For example, I always bring this up as an example of the best controller ever designed, and that would be the Saturn Dual Analog Controller.
3853894	3855654	It fits naturally to your hand.
3856215	3859216	Even the PlayStation controller, it's meant to fit to your hand.
3860056	3864819	You know, why is it that Nintendo has always had these bizarre-ass controllers that hurt to play?
3866019	3869441	Well, I think the Super Nintendo had an intelligent controller.
3869461	3869621	Yeah.
3870089	3875914	And if you'll notice, they re-released that style controller for the NES when they brought out the top loader.
3877055	3880918	They did one... Naki did one for the GameCube.
3881078	3882119	I have, like, two of them.
3885422	3894730	I think that a lot of the complaint they're going to get with this controller, apart from it just being a really bad idea in general, is a case of ergonomics.
3894830	3898533	That controller is not going to be a comfortable thing to play for a long time.
3899383	3900964	We'll see, we'll see.
3901144	3905446	Did you see the mock-up that Loki posted on our website earlier, just a couple days ago?
3905466	3907167	I saw what was on Nintendo's website.
3907747	3914251	Did you see the WaveBird thing, where you can plug that little remote into a WaveBird-style controller, and you can play...
3915214	3918435	Your Revolution Games, like with a GameCube-style controller, basically.
3918455	3926759	Well, see, my other thought was that, you know, a month later, they were going to bring out some overpriced controller that's all ergonomically sound that they're going to charge a bajillion for, because it's Nintendo!
3927259	3928239	They do shit like this.
3928479	3929440	Are your arms hurting?
3929500	3934522	Get the new Nintendo Arm Herd Eliminator, or whatever they call it.
3934562	3942225	Well, seriously, I knew right now, I'm not going to be able to play that machine, given the wrist problems I have at work.
3943065	3944146	I have to use a trackball mouse.
3945754	3953500	I can't hold two separate things like that and hold my hand in that position without having quite a bit of pain.
3954521	3956183	So are you going to give it a try?
3956203	3957724	Of course I'm going to try it.
3957744	3961127	See if maybe the feel of it is different than it looks at first?
3961347	3970115	Of course I'm going to try it, but in the end, looking at the design, having a very good sense of spatial awareness and knowing how my hands work...
3970854	3993049	You know, and just with the bajillions of other people I work with, you know, good friends of mine at my job who all have carpal tunnel, various other ailments that come from doing a desk job, you know, even for people who just play on the internet a lot, you know, are developing the same wrist ailments because the average home is not set up to be ergonomically correct for your own desk.
3993329	3993469	Right.
3994036	3997417	Imagine having this in your hand for standard gameplay.
3997778	4000859	And a lot of gamers, when they get into their game, they'll ignore their own pain for the game.
4001099	4001499	I'm sorry.
4001559	4002079	It happens.
4002359	4002900	I've done it.
4002920	4003700	Some people don't, yeah.
4004400	4011603	And that's going to cause... It's just going to open up a load of medical concerns.
4012103	4012444	We'll see.
4012584	4014244	I really do think it's going to be a question of ergonomics.
4014364	4017946	Now, let's not forget, though, that things could change.
4018006	4019486	This is still very, very early on.
4019527	4022408	And I seem to recall that when we saw the Nintendo DS at E3...
4023468	4027952	Only a few months before its release, the DS kind of changed.
4028272	4031334	I remember the one at E3 was more rounded on the size.
4031594	4039680	It kind of changed the way the DS is shaped, and so they changed kind of the way the controller and buttons were, so things could change with this before it's actually released.
4039820	4045524	I did notice a different setting of the buttons, and this is actually a little bit more comfortable to play than the lockup they had at E3.
4046465	4047146	So, yeah.
4047486	4047966	So we'll see.
4048026	4054370	So maybe when they do some of the extensive testing, some of your concerns are going to come out and they'll kind of rethink some things.
4054690	4054890	Yeah.
4055270	4056271	We'll see what happens.
4056511	4057072	We'll see what happens.
4057512	4057872	All right.
4058632	4061974	And by the way, according to Firebomb, Loki, you're the reason babies cry at night.
4064156	4066137	Yeah, they don't stop bitching.
4066297	4067178	I just ignore it.
4067218	4067538	All right.
4068358	4070700	You know, I got over it like years ago.
4071000	4071280	All right.
4071480	4071880	That's fine.
4072321	4072601	All right.
4074122	4074382	All right.
4074773	4077113	We're going to get into... Hi, how are you?
4077774	4078514	Well, hi, guys.
4081554	4084195	Anyway, let's... How long have you guys been knocking on the door?
4084235	4084875	We didn't even hear you.
4086075	4086635	Oh, okay.
4087756	4088076	Yeah, sorry.
4088336	4088776	Anyway, hi.
4088896	4090856	We were just joined by Angel and Magus.
4090896	4094677	Let's see if we can get them a microphone here real quick.
4094717	4096577	Real, real quick, because I've got to answer a call on Skype here.
4097738	4098218	Hey, guys.
4098558	4099138	Hey, how you doing?
4099178	4099818	You sound sick.
4100258	4101799	No, I'm just really, really tired.
4101879	4103519	We've had a long weekend at the...
4105320	4106221	They're real life gathering.
4106241	4109624	I know most of you hear me talk about that quite a bit, but yeah.
4110564	4113226	So, it's just meeting real people behind their cars.
4113267	4115008	Well, welcome back to the show, Angel.
4115028	4116129	I know it's been a while since you've been here.
4116149	4116569	Yeah, I know.
4116789	4120252	Alright, and the 23rd Magus, you haven't been here in a long-ass time.
4120452	4120953	I know.
4121093	4122794	It's been painful.
4123134	4124295	I swear, it's been painful.
4124796	4125876	Well, you're here.
4125976	4129459	I just want to slap your shirt, because it's a giant power button.
4131040	4132081	Not that I want to turn you on, but anyway.
4134856	4135837	Let's move on.
4136697	4137338	Let's move on.
4137398	4138659	Thanks for the pleasant surprise, you guys.
4139579	4140940	For the record, you're looking older.
4143022	4145563	Aw, our Andrew's getting so big.
4147104	4147344	Anyway.
4147865	4148585	I'm just kidding.
4148886	4152488	I've got somebody on Skype that's waiting for us to cut the bullshit and get to his call.
4152548	4153889	So, hello, Siggy.
4153949	4154509	How are you doing?
4155150	4155770	Hey, Scott.
4155790	4156491	I'm doing fine.
4156711	4157031	Good.
4157071	4157491	Good to hear.
4158292	4159513	Now, what's this?
4159573	4164456	You found some new stuff in regards to 2DX 10th style, the consumer version?
4165191	4165451	Yep.
4165872	4166853	What do you got for us tonight?
4167534	4173241	There are two 2DX10 style CS exclusives, but they are long versions.
4173441	4174062	Ooh, very cool.
4174082	4175264	So we have some long versions.
4175324	4177086	Now, how did you come across these MP3s?
4178508	4182413	Panda of LOTB from Bimani Style of Forms has posted it.
4183567	4184667	on the temporary forums.
4184767	4185148	Very cool.
4185168	4185628	Yeah, that's right.
4185648	4193090	Bamani Style right now is running on some temporary forums, and I thought it was kind of interesting because isn't, like, some gaming company hosting their sites, like PlayAsia or something?
4193290	4196111	Yeah, it was PlayAsia was hosting the temporary forums.
4196191	4196471	Interesting.
4196931	4200312	Are they still running on a temporary basis, or did they get back up, or what?
4200572	4202033	I haven't visited them in a while.
4202153	4203373	They're still running right now.
4203493	4203773	Oh, cool.
4203813	4204054	Okay.
4205034	4205434	Very cool.
4205874	4206154	All right.
4207155	4208455	So anyway, about these songs...
4209688	4215570	Before I introduce the songs, I want to post this website on the chatroom right now.
4215750	4216270	Go for it.
4216470	4218871	And that chatroom, once again, orangeloungeradio.com.
4218931	4224152	Click on chat if you want to join in the chatroom and get these little links as people post them, as Siggy's doing right now.
4224792	4225233	Here it is.
4225553	4227253	It's on the Xenon website.
4228574	4237016	And what this site has is pictures of 2GX 10th Style CS shot from a Tokyo game show.
4237472	4239273	Traces, Quasar, LoveShine, and the also-loving V
4263223	4276550	Now, somebody mentioned the V thing in the chatroom before the show started, and I was just like, oh my gosh, okay, if V is returning in 10th style, that means it was in 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and now 10th.
4277511	4278512	Can we say overkill?
4279632	4281053	Yeah, it's really the longest one.
4281113	4281813	Wow, okay.
4283034	4284755	And now I'm gonna introduce the, uh...
4285430	4291913	CS exclusives that have been confirmed so far, there are four of them, and two of them are going to be on the minute-long clip.
4292393	4293533	I'm going to introduce the first one.
4293633	4298035	The genre is GABA, and the song is Hype the Core by DJ Chucky.
4299516	4300896	Oh, okay.
4301797	4306699	And then the second genre is Psychedelic Trance, and it's by LED.
4306779	4308099	It's Ixian.
4308800	4309040	Mm-hmm.
4309858	4319848	and now for the songs that has to clip a minute long and the genre is R&B and here's Asami with Strong Woman featuring Dabo alright, here it is
4346393	4347263	Yeah, he's coming.
4370069	4372951	Akira Yamaoka's album got pushed back to January, is that true?
4397524	4399806	I didn't get any details for that.
4399926	4400926	I heard something about it.
4401006	4405930	I don't know if this is true or not, but I heard that Akira Yamaoka's album is getting pushed back from October to January, which is kind of a bummer.
4405950	4408372	Because it was supposed to come out Halloween week, which is so appropriate.
4408412	4408812	But we'll see.
4408972	4409252	We'll see.
4409593	4409793	Anyway.
4410698	4415021	And here's the last song, you know, one of the CS exclusives.
4415441	4417482	And this one's a very deep Japanese meaning.
4417542	4419883	I still can't figure out what it means.
4420804	4424606	So here's the genre is Japanese Pops.
4424866	4429108	Here's Burme Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka with Taito no Suika.
4429429	4429869	Alright, here it is.
4448322	4448985	Thanks for watching!
4487503	4489284	It's kind of a different one.
4489344	4490544	I don't know if I could see that in 2DX.
4490564	4492845	It reminds me of the soundtrack that goes in the shell.
4493865	4496666	It reminds me too much of Yoko Kanno.
4498367	4499367	It's a good song.
4499407	4500507	I like that song.
4500748	4502448	That's going to be an interesting one for 2DX.
4502508	4503969	Maybe that's going to be an easy difficulty.
4504009	4504289	I don't know.
4504329	4504629	We'll see.
4506129	4506890	Yeah, hopefully.
4507170	4509050	It would be difficult on another.
4509471	4511371	Yeah, I could see that, maybe.
4511891	4513552	Now, what's your personal opinion on those two songs?
4514395	4519056	Well, I kind of like Strong Woman featuring Dabo better than Taito no Suika.
4543055	4555663	On the Zenon website, there are links that have the video files that contain videos from Chen Style CS that has been recorded, like Ixion and Hype the Core, and also Strong Woman.
4555964	4562168	However, when I watch these videos, you won't be able to hear the actual song.
4562848	4564149	Oh, you can just see the video.
4564689	4570654	Yeah, you can only see the video, but you're only going to hear outside what's happening on TGS.
4571094	4571274	Right.
4572413	4576135	Speaking of what's happening on TGS4, what else have you heard about what's going on at Tokyo Game Show?
4577096	4578857	Anything else that's exciting to you?
4579257	4580118	Nothing much else.
4580418	4587102	I only checked out Poppin' Music and Guitadora V. I was surprised that they're going to have Guitadora V for the PS2.
4587162	4590604	That was kind of a real surprise announcement, I think, to a lot of us.
4590664	4595227	We kind of all assumed that Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania on PS2 was dead and gone.
4595768	4602195	But it always was kind of interesting that they kept it going in the arcades and yet no love for it on the console.
4602215	4606499	So it was just kind of like, maybe it was something that we always kind of wished would happen in the back of our minds.
4606519	4608261	It was just kind of sudden, like, oh my gosh.
4608421	4618492	I mean, we were expecting, you know, obviously we were expecting 2DX10th, we were expecting Strike, we were expecting Iroha, but to see Guitar Freaks as well is pretty cool, so...
4619269	4629873	I think the only thing that could top that in the surprise category is, like Loki said, they end up bringing that to America, which would be very interesting when you consider the Guitar Heroes on its way as well.
4629893	4630974	It could be very interesting.
4631854	4634315	So we'll see.
4635176	4638717	All right, well, Siggy, thank you very much for calling in and sharing those songs with us.
4638757	4642819	We appreciate it, helping us stay in the know on what's going on in the Bomani world.
4642919	4644359	No problem.
4644480	4645460	Any other final thoughts for us?
4646261	4656509	Um, not at the moment, I just can't think of any, but, uh, you know, everybody's been, uh, on the, uh, Bermanis South Formas have been complaining about V. Being back in the game again.
4656789	4657069	Yeah.
4657089	4657770	Yeah.
4657790	4669979	It, uh, you know, it's one of those things now where they must just be doing it out of tradition or something, I don't know, because the song's so horrid, I don't know if it's some type of nod to the fans or something, but...
4670672	4672055	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
4681323	4682243	Oh, one more thing.
4682864	4686145	On the 10th style result screens, they're going to feature more Goliaths.
4686225	4690267	I heard about that, because in the arcades, they didn't have anything unless you AAA'd a song.
4690287	4691467	They lacked a Goliath.
4691687	4691927	Yeah.
4691947	4692968	They lacked the Goliaths.
4694388	4696269	It's already featured on the Xenon website right now.
4696329	4704313	It's featured Nix and the... Use for the single A and then Nix for the double A. Very cool, very cool.
4704613	4707374	Oh, you're talking about the repetition of V, right?
4707394	4707534	Yeah.
4708055	4709375	Well, look at DDR.
4709695	4711096	For example, say, B4U.
4711156	4715796	It's been in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, actually 6 mixes if you count 4th Plus.
4716516	4719737	Okay, okay, maybe, but not 6 back-to-back mixes.
4720837	4721897	But I get what you're saying.
4721937	4723698	B4U is kind of a DDR anthem.
4723878	4724498	It's a staple.
4724518	4727438	I mean, hell, they named a band after it, so, you know, okay, I get it.
4727458	4727978	I guess it kind of fits.
4727998	4728659	I get it, maybe.
4728979	4732279	But B4U is also a 2DX song, so why not repeat that over and over again?
4732519	4734620	Because it's a staple of DDR, not 2DX.
4735540	4736500	All right, all right.
4736560	4737320	It's just a cameo.
4738584	4738924	All right.
4739364	4739965	All right, Siggy.
4740005	4742365	Thanks so much for your call and calling us tonight.
4742405	4742645	All right.
4742685	4743126	Have a good one.
4743166	4743366	Yeah.
4743606	4743826	All right.
4743846	4744086	Bye.
4744306	4744486	Later.
4744506	4744686	Later.
4745706	4745986	All right.
4746006	4746367	That's the one.
4746387	4746907	Always, Siggy.
4749168	4751968	Sharing some 2DX MP3s with us.
4752048	4752789	We appreciate that.
4754258	4755039	Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune
4776041	4777662	That's actually the second game.
4778323	4778583	Tune 2.
4778623	4781765	The soundtrack is the first and second.
4782325	4783827	So each disc is each game.
4784127	4784627	Oh, very cool.
4784807	4785107	Very cool.
4786368	4786769	All right.
4787189	4788450	And it had Paul and Terry.
4788690	4789090	It did.
4789130	4791172	You allowed Paul and Terry to be played on the station.
4791212	4792913	Just because the whole soundtrack is fabulous.
4792993	4793894	Yeah, it's a good soundtrack.
4793914	4795955	And I actually like the Paul and Terry songs on there.
4797196	4799618	Also, before we go to break, I want to talk to Angel and Magus a little more.
4799638	4801639	So you guys went... Yeah, damn.
4802159	4803460	You come to the show and you have to talk.
4803540	4804921	Oh, okay.
4805482	4805602	Um...
4806607	4807007	MMO without an RPG
4832031	4834733	Sounds like a graphical chat, or is there a game to it?
4834853	4850325	Basically, it's like that, but you have, it's just based around a series of islands and such, and you have like buggies and hoverboards and hoverboats, and you can own property and play several mini-games in there.
4850445	4851606	It's not The Sims.
4851926	4854708	It's a social MMO, is basically what it is.
4855009	4855389	Pretty much.
4857739	4858439	That's interesting.
4858539	4859880	I wonder why I don't hear more about it.
4859940	4861120	Well, how many people were at this convention?
4862240	4863301	About 55 or so.
4863741	4864221	Okay, cool.
4864401	4865581	And what kind of stuff did they do?
4865601	4885187	They had a lot of, kind of like meetings, but not, like, you know, each of the staff would give a presentation on certain things involving the community of the game, whether it be economics or community involvement or just,
4885923	4888724	It's just an open chat.
4888904	4894405	We would split up whoever wanted to go to whatever speech or whatever.
4895505	4897046	I don't know, it was just good.
4897566	4897846	Cool.
4898186	4908229	Plus you got to meet a lot of the people that you have interacted with in the game and gotten to be friends with.
4908429	4911349	It's just, I don't know, it's a very awesome experience.
4912290	4912590	Alright.
4913330	4913950	So, yeah.
4915120	4916061	Sounds good, sounds good.
4916782	4917642	Very good times.
4917822	4918883	I'm very tired, though.
4919844	4921766	You sound a little bit tired, but that's alright.
4922126	4923448	I'm usually tired after this convention.
4923548	4930754	Usually, when you hear the show on Orange Haunts Radio that's right after E3, we all sound like we want to die.
4930854	4931575	It was kind of funny.
4931835	4932856	We all sound like we want to die.
4933076	4934257	Life blows.
4934438	4934698	Yeah.
4934718	4935318	Yeah.
4935699	4936880	Yeah.
4937060	4937901	Hotels.
4939022	4940403	It was a nice hotel, but it's like...
4941319	4942160	I want to go home now, bye.
4958570	4963515	Red has Scorpion Fire, so I'll bet money that V is not in Red consumer style.
4963915	4969081	So maybe that's one reason why V keeps repeating, because of the difficulty.
4969441	4970622	Okay, I can see that, maybe.
4970882	4971323	Safe bet.
4971563	4971944	Safe bet.
4973345	4979331	Although I would think most people that are going after the difficulty have, like, five different versions of 2DX, but, eh, that's just me.
4980267	4981408	Talk Like a Pirate Day Talk Like a Pirate Day
5009727	5011328	Very hushed Japanese, like in the movies.
5012069	5015351	No, this is where you walk around and everyone goes, Hi!
5015391	5016432	You go, Horosu.
5020875	5021535	Oh, that was geeky.
5021755	5022696	Alright, we'll be back after this.
5152066	5154190	Thank you for watching!
5194547	5195655	Thank you for watching!
5296118	5297060	Thanks for watching!
5338398	5339405	Thanks for watching!
5414401	5414963	Thank you for watching
5457802	5458762	Gaming Radio.
5459002	5466265	So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
5466445	5467786	Orange Lounge Radio.
5468446	5475028	Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
5476249	5477969	Hope you enjoyed some of the songs there in that break.
5478009	5480370	Nebula Grasper from the 2DX.
5480990	5482511	Ghosts from Ted DDR.
5483980	5489001	AA or Double Ace, however you choose to pronounce that one, from 2DXRed as well.
5489121	5489881	And then I Feel.
5490121	5492762	That was actually the DDR version, but of course I Feel was in both games.
5493022	5494482	So, anyway.
5496083	5498303	I feel better because I have vanilla milkshake.
5499203	5500823	Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?
5502684	5505124	Thank you for resurrecting that joke that died years ago.
5506105	5507905	You know, that was just last year, wasn't it?
5507925	5508745	That that song was big?
5508765	5510325	That was just last year.
5510886	5511246	Not bad.
5512506	5512946	Alright.
5514629	5516032	DarkSakura, how are you doing over there?
5516673	5517715	About to blast somebody.
5517875	5518677	Yeah, what's going on?
5519306	5527528	Apparently somebody on dig.com said that our podcast sucks because for some reason they added a ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle.
5527928	5529268	What the fuck?
5529648	5531469	That ditzy girl they're referring to is actually Rob.
5531909	5534410	Yeah, I'm the ditzy girl apparently.
5535290	5536110	No, no, no, no, no.
5536130	5536930	Will you put that in your reply?
5537770	5546673	First of all, first of all, I probably have more intelligence in my little toe than this person does if they clone them on repeat ad infinitum, okay?
5547813	5548273	Secondly...
5551002	5551923	It's a stupid message board.
5552644	5554245	Are you going to dignify it with a response?
5555225	5557367	Although you already did, but that's all right.
5557787	5559228	I haven't said anything yet.
5559548	5561670	Well, here's the thing, though.
5561710	5567454	Anybody that's coming over from the podcast, because we had an increase of listeners to this live show because of our podcast, which is pretty cool.
5567714	5568654	I'm just going to say this.
5569375	5573698	I repeated his comment to quote and say which one I'm referring to, and I'm just going to say this.
5574038	5576480	Next time, listen to the podcast all the way through.
5577600	5579562	Before deciding, I'm sorry, but you're a loser.
5579782	5584567	No, I'm not going to call him a loser because I know my netiquette, but I am going to say that you were the giggling girl.
5588567	5589107	Alright, that's fine.
5590708	5591088	That's fine.
5593630	5599413	If you know the history of Orange Launch Radio, this radio station actually started with DarkSakura and myself.
5599493	5605957	Loki actually was not a part of the original vision of the station because we didn't really know Loki when the show first started.
5606357	5610279	We met him, we knew who he was, he was this guy.
5610299	5610960	You knew me!
5611040	5613401	We knew you, but we didn't know that much about you.
5613581	5616003	You came to the Bomani parties and we knew that you'd
5616943	5617884	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
5647578	5650422	If we want to find some giggling girls, maybe we can get some, but I don't know.
5650883	5652004	Okay, here's my response.
5652144	5652665	All right, what?
5652765	5655128	I want to see what everyone thinks before I send it.
5655689	5659634	I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling... First, Monkey Butler, okay?
5661817	5665722	Okay, I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling me a giggling ditzy girl.
5666368	5670911	He said this about my podcast, because we all did it.
5671031	5672192	Podcast Orange Lounge Radio.
5672572	5677775	Another gaming podcast that sucks because for some reason they added a ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle or an attempted joke.
5678416	5680457	Excuse me, listen to the entire thing first.
5680537	5681418	I was not added.
5681558	5686601	I am a creator of not only the podcast, but of our three-hour live show, which we've been running for three years.
5687722	5688862	Besides, Rob is the giggling girl.
5690819	5691659	That's fine, that's fine.
5692060	5695921	And our chatroom, once you post that, our chatroom wants a link to that.
5696021	5697162	Oh, somebody actually found it.
5697782	5698262	That was nice.
5698983	5701043	Wow, look at our listeners.
5701184	5701884	Look at them go.
5702424	5705365	They totally found that without us having to link them to it.
5705385	5707326	They just got on the net and started searching and looking.
5707947	5708347	Oh, great.
5708387	5715730	Now the listeners are going to... That's all right.
5716684	5717845	Just remember, it's just some guy.
5718726	5720748	It's just some stupid kid.
5723832	5725433	Just be careful with what you say.
5725453	5727155	Of course, then again, you know what?
5727175	5728056	What's the worst that's going to happen?
5728397	5730158	More people decide to download our show.
5730599	5731019	Damn.
5732121	5732221	Damn.
5732761	5733202	Damn.
5736414	5737034	All right.
5737234	5741677	I want to mention also that we were voted number one game podcast in podcast awards.
5742137	5746999	Yeah, somebody please go into the chat room and mention, not chat room, but on that site and mention that because I forgot to.
5747019	5751781	It doesn't matter.
5751801	5752302	It's on gig.
5752342	5753642	It's like four pages back.
5753722	5754763	Our Skype line is open.
5754783	5756564	OrangeSoundsRadio.com.
5756584	5757804	Click on interact with us.
5758184	5762426	And right now our Skype list is kind of interesting because it says six over 66.
5763959	5767581	So six people are online out of 66 that we have on our buddy list there.
5768342	5769222	I don't know, 666?
5769262	5769502	Get it?
5769623	5770243	Anyway.
5773965	5774866	You know what's interesting, though?
5775526	5788794	Even though we are the best gaming podcast, according to the podcastwords.com, iTunes this week featured 16 gaming podcasts on their front page in a gamers strike back type category.
5789215	5790095	Orange Lounge Radio?
5790916	5791476	Not one of them.
5793120	5794981	Well, iTunes has so much wrong with it.
5795221	5797982	Well, we were on there before as well, too, so at least we can say that.
5798042	5801563	We were on as an interesting indie a while ago, so we can't complain too much.
5802003	5803564	We don't have the word game in our title.
5804604	5806685	All right, Loki, hurry up your quick thought, because we've got a call on the line.
5806845	5807345	No, go ahead.
5807365	5807726	Take the call.
5807746	5808626	All right, we're going to take the call.
5808666	5809626	Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
5811127	5812267	You already know who this is?
5812507	5812988	Of course.
5813048	5813628	Hi, Saku.
5813648	5814008	How are you?
5815288	5815589	Fine.
5815709	5816369	What's on your mind?
5817969	5820391	Just seeing that DDR Strike is no joke now.
5820931	5824834	Obviously, you already heard Love is Orange.
5824854	5825935	That's all I have to say.
5826095	5828236	Yep, Love is Orange is going to be in DDR Strike.
5828376	5829097	Very interesting.
5831078	5833220	We finally got some Oni steps.
5833400	5834721	I think that's kind of cool as well.
5835201	5839504	You know, what could be interesting is that we haven't really heard of a lot of...
5839724	5842405	and Konami Originals that are going to be in EX2.
5842445	5843705	We've heard of all these licensed songs.
5843745	5846306	We haven't heard a lot of Konami Originals besides the one shown in E3.
5846326	5853608	Yeah, because Konami learned, you know, Konami learned that if stuff is leaked beforehand, you know, people start bitching and moaning.
5853668	5854208	Exactly.
5854228	5860170	So that's why they're keeping, yeah, that's why we haven't gotten, you know, that many Ultramix 3 songs, you know, song names yet.
5860190	5862290	Zaku, I absolutely agree with you on that.
5862330	5866031	Believe it or not, I absolutely agree that that's the reason why Konami is keeping it under wraps.
5866111	5867812	They're keeping it under wraps so you don't bitch about it.
5869122	5872124	Exactly, that's basically how you do it.
5872164	5877267	You wait until the right moment, and in this case, DDR Extreme 2 should be coming out next week.
5877987	5880469	So then we'll probably know what's going to be on it.
5880489	5881470	My god, is it really next week?
5881950	5882410	Next week?
5882610	5883251	Like, nope.
5883851	5884111	Two weeks.
5884131	5885972	Yeah, I think it's the 27th.
5885992	5887593	Okay, that's two weeks.
5887973	5889554	By my calendar, it's two weeks.
5889594	5892196	I gotta give my call to have them send me a copy.
5892276	5893537	I thought it was the 27th, come on.
5896368	5896609	WTF!
5896849	5897069	WTF!
5926188	5929749	You know, here it is, here it is, Zaku.
5929969	5937752	I think that in order to separate themselves from Sony and Microsoft, they've got to take a gamble and try something different.
5938112	5939052	And I think that's what they're doing.
5939672	5941253	Is it going to be a good thing or a bad thing?
5941493	5942013	I don't know.
5942293	5943694	Will they put Kid Icarus on it?
5943814	5944654	That's my thing.
5948455	5949135	No, I know, I know.
5949395	5954657	How would you, I mean, I could understand, I could understand the control being used as a gun.
5955481	5961026	Just for, you know, for shooter games, but, you know, fighting games, I really, you really need something.
5961266	5969274	Take the little sticky part that looks like a remote control, turn it 90 degrees, and it looks just like an old school NES controller.
5970942	5971743	Except thinner.
5972684	5973104	Think about it.
5973144	5974305	Yeah, take the remote.
5974605	5974926	Seriously.
5975726	5978509	And I credit absolutely DarkTetsuya with pointing this out to me.
5978889	5980471	Take the remote, turn it 90 degrees.
5980491	5981572	You want us to play sideways?
5981592	5982192	Oh my god.
5982573	5983193	So there you go.
5984034	5986596	As I said, I'm just going for PS3.
5986656	5988758	Money's all in there right now.
5988979	5992462	I'm actually, believe it or not, I'm picking up an Xbox 360.
5992602	5993463	I'm going to have all of them.
5994924	5997665	I know I will too eventually.
5997705	6004248	It's going to be really hard to hack PS3 because Blu-ray is pretty tight up the ass.
6004288	6008430	Blu-ray is going to be damn near impossible to... But that's what they said about DVD.
6008751	6011432	Exactly, that's what they said about DVD.
6012813	6021117	Yeah, but from what we're seeing, it looks like they've pretty much fixed all the loopholes that DVD had.
6021747	6027729	In other words, Blu-ray was supposed to be something a lot better than DVD.
6027989	6032951	It was supposed to be almost invincible and perfect in that sense.
6033772	6035172	But, you know, not everything's perfect.
6035192	6035752	Yeah, we'll see.
6036012	6038714	If there is a way to crack it, somehow the hacking world will.
6038734	6039194	But we'll see.
6039294	6039614	We'll see.
6040414	6041495	Anyway, any other thoughts, Daku?
6041515	6044156	Because we've got to go pretty quick here so we can get some other people in before the cage match.
6044756	6045076	Anything else?
6047216	6047476	Hello?
6048317	6050599	Yeah, I guess that's about it so far.
6051000	6052861	DDR Strike equals Oni, that's it.
6053182	6054002	Alright, we'll see.
6054063	6055304	Have a good one, Zaku.
6055324	6057306	DDR Extreme 2 next week, let's go.
6057706	6059127	Alright, later.
6061369	6062030	That kid's fun.
6062130	6063592	Alright, let's go to another call here.
6063932	6065033	Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.
6065954	6067435	Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.
6067475	6069277	Hello, SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind?
6072828	6074750	I just wanted to talk about the Revolution Controller.
6074890	6075630	Alright, what's up?
6075810	6077232	What's your thoughts on the Revolution Controller?
6078813	6082896	Just basically, it looks like everyone's Smash Brothers skills are going to be thrown out the window with this thing.
6083697	6091122	But what about the little mock-up that Loki posted where you can plug the little remote thingy into a Wave Bird type controller?
6091162	6093344	I mean, that'll be just like a GameCube.
6093664	6096326	Do you know that when you throw it out the window, it will know when you throw it out the window.
6096647	6097908	Shut up, Bug.
6097948	6098228	Shut up.
6098993	6105994	I mean, it's possible, but you know, if you're going to go to a tournament, you're just going to see a lot of people just wailing around a remote control, trying to wave dash.
6106254	6114856	Yeah, but this is a Star Wars fan's dream right there, because the controller can be a lightsaber in future Star Wars games.
6114936	6122957	And then, you know, you can just go around that... Then they'll have Revolutionary Controller, or Revolution Controller Kid videos going around.
6122977	6126998	And then they'll get his own... You know what it looks like?
6127018	6128378	It looks like a Star Trek phaser.
6130706	6131387	Kinda.
6131487	6132928	Whoa, old school flashback time.
6132968	6133188	What?
6133548	6135049	Who remembers Die by the Sword?
6135990	6136370	I don't.
6137090	6149839	It was this first person hack and slash game where either you use the mouse to control literally the sword arm, and you can just slice, hack and slash with that sword by moving the mouse or with a joystick.
6150759	6155563	I'm thinking there were going to be some damn good sword fighting games, like say that Dragon Warrior...
6157339	6158641	I know, but the possibility is endless.
6158681	6158881	I hope.
6172409	6173669	Let's just call this what this is.
6173689	6177810	This is what happens when, you know, the Power Glove has sex with a remote control.
6178431	6178951	The end.
6179111	6179891	That's what it is.
6180031	6183792	You know what the Nintendo controller looks like to me?
6184112	6187873	Like if you disconnected that one portion of it, it would look like a tampon.
6188693	6190394	Actually, with the little, with the cord.
6190634	6192354	That doesn't look like a tampon.
6192374	6195675	Yeah, forget it.
6195755	6197795	Tampons don't have two A and B buttons.
6198656	6199156	Forget it.
6199596	6200036	Forget it.
6203676	6207218	SSJ100, Matt, any other thoughts on things you've heard about at Tokyo Game Show?
6208439	6215863	Well, like you, I'm also a little disappointed that the Revolution may or may not have HD capabilities on it.
6215883	6219186	You have caught me bitching about this in the forums incessantly.
6219246	6220727	Yes, I was... 480p.
6221267	6228892	Somebody created something in the forums about the Nintendo Revolution and the controller and everything, and my immediate response was...
6229614	6230014	Was that you?
6230054	6230354	I'm sorry.
6231535	6235137	My immediate response in the forum was something to the effect of, you know what?
6235257	6236358	I don't care about the controller.
6236418	6239660	My bitch about Nintendo Revolution right now is that there's no HD support.
6240700	6250806	And as somebody who's an HD TV owner, as I think a lot of Americans will be over the next three years, what the F?
6250846	6254448	How can you be a next-gen system and not support the next-gen picture technology?
6254609	6255809	I do not understand that at all.
6256270	6257030	Well, you know, praise...
6258496	6259676	Soon everything's going to be HD.
6259716	6261937	I mean, I've actually shot on HD cameras.
6262477	6262997	Ooh, cool.
6264797	6268338	I mean, I actually use the same... You there?
6268578	6269038	Yeah, I'm here.
6269058	6275299	I was just going to say, just earlier tonight, my roommate was watching the Emmys pre-show on the HD channel.
6275739	6279260	Like, okay, who cares about Star Jones and HD?
6279400	6282481	But it's out there now, so soon everything will be on HD.
6282521	6283161	It's inevitable.
6284041	6284181	Yeah.
6285813	6289314	I've actually used the same exact camera that they used on episode 3.
6290274	6291034	Oh, very cool.
6294155	6299496	HD is not really any much different than regular, like digital wise, it's fine.
6303017	6307217	You know, little known fact, actually when I was in college I also studied television.
6307277	6310438	Television was my major, media arts, communication design.
6311164	6317286	was my major, so I played a lot with cameras when I was in college, too, and did a lot of studio work, and worked for a TV station for a short time.
6318887	6319907	That's what I'm working on now.
6320067	6320447	All right.
6321168	6321468	Very cool.
6321508	6324369	I mean, I actually applied to G4 last week.
6324849	6325589	Oh, that's right.
6325629	6326770	I remember reading something.
6327390	6328230	Good luck with that.
6328370	6332512	If you get in to work for the man, don't forget about us little people.
6333612	6339435	Well, actually, I'm working for a TV show out here, but for the time being, I'm hoping G4 contacts me.
6339595	6339915	Oh, cool.
6339955	6340495	Good luck with that.
6340888	6341709	See you in LA, maybe.
6343110	6343390	All right.
6343430	6343631	Yeah.
6344431	6347434	All right, well, anyway, SSJ100, Matt, is there anything else you'd like to share with us tonight?
6348435	6348715	Uh, nope.
6348976	6349216	All right.
6349236	6353320	Well, then we're going to let you go, see if we get any other calls, and move on to the cage match, all right?
6353360	6353820	Have a good one.
6354601	6355362	Yep, you too, bye.
6355462	6355662	Later.
6356423	6359045	All right, more feedback there on the Nintendo Revolution controller.
6360166	6360767	And, uh...
6361525	6370888	A lot, a lot of people, just on the blogging scene out there, everybody that's got some type of gaming blog in one way or another has some... What guy?
6372388	6373269	He's not online right now.
6374209	6374949	Oh, no, me.
6375009	6376910	Oh, I thought you were pointing out somebody else on the list.
6379350	6385492	Anyway, I don't see any other calls coming in, so I think we're going to go ahead and we don't want to run too behind in the show anyway.
6385512	6388353	We got to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
6394526	6395328	Orange Lounge Radio
6406885	6431805	Our Bomani and Video Game Music Show Which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this station when we are not live Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match It was a very close cage match But in the end, Good Cool won it With just a couple votes over some of the other songs that were in last week's cage match And it's a trance mix of Blame, and it was Loki's pick So that's the first song we're going to hear tonight Again, as a reminder, you only hear a clip
6432145	6435786	of last week's winner because it's assumed that you've already heard the song in its entirety.
6436306	6439387	And then we're going to play two more songs for you guys in full.
6439687	6441267	You guys have to be in the chat room to vote.
6441407	6443248	OrangeLionTrader.com, click on chat.
6443968	6451810	And let's get it started here with a clip of song number one, Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Coot with Blame, the trance mix.

6526806	6527710	Thanks for watching!
6606498	6608800	Alrighty, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.
6608820	6611762	That was Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Coot with Blame.
6611863	6615666	Let's get into some new songs and see what kind of competition Blame has tonight.
6616086	6618468	The first one is DarkSakura's pick.
6618508	6620269	DarkSakura, what did you pick and why?
6621830	6626114	I really like Wanga's Midnight Maximum tune a whole bunch and the music in it is awesome.
6626534	6631458	So this one is Yuzuko Shiro with Destination Blackout.
6631638	6632399	It's just a really cool song.
6633067	6636690	Alright, so this was not in tonight's pre-show because this is from the first game, right?
6636710	6638031	This is on the first soundtrack.
6638112	6638372	Alright.
6638392	6638932	The first CD.
6639012	6639353	Sounds good.
6639913	6642335	Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.
6642415	6642776	Enjoy.
6643877	6644577	Be quiet.
6644717	6645378	Unknown.
6645458	6646018	Out of space.
6646038	6646939	Destination Blackout.
6646979	6647219	One, two.
6715588	6715991	Dream Seed
6753201	6753862	Don't forget now!
6754123	6754984	No more enemies!
6859657	6861118	Thanks for watching!
6900010	6900571	One, two, three.
6936483	6941945	Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match, Yuzo Koshiro from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.
6942205	6943906	That was Destination Blackout.
6944146	6945407	What did you kids think of that?
6945427	6946467	We'll start off with DarkSakura.
6946487	6954290	You know, I'm normally not a trance person at all, but this made me think of almost like taking symphonic music and syncing it up.
6954970	6955710	And I really like it.
6955770	6956631	I really, really like it.
6956671	6957871	I love all the music in the game.
6957911	6960472	It's a lot more fun to play that game stat instead of Eurobeat.
6961092	6962193	So it gets a 9.5.
6963013	6963653	9.5 out of 10.
6963854	6964694	And it's Yuzo Koshiro.
6964714	6964994	He's like
6965504	6966144	Angel, Jackass, Angel
6994468	6995048	Good stuff.
6997130	6997570	Nine.
6998490	6998791	All right.
6998871	7001372	I can't, like... Well, maybe I could give it a ten.
7001392	7001652	A nine.
7002073	7003414	A nine from Angel.
7003534	7004214	Almost a ten.
7004354	7004694	Magus.
7005215	7008437	Used to hearing it all the time, so... I don't know.
7009037	7011358	I like it, but I hear too much of it.
7011398	7012379	I'll try to be unbiased.
7012559	7012859	Nine.
7013500	7014560	All right.
7014640	7015201	My thoughts.
7016341	7016862	I liked it.
7016922	7017422	It was cool.
7017482	7021965	It was the kind of song... It did get a little bit repetitive, which is odd because a lot of trance is repetitive, but...
7022270	7051165	it got a little repetitive for me but it was like a cool song like I could imagine myself driving down the road to that song except I would want guns on my car like in Spy Hunter and I'm kind of frustrated that I don't actually have guns on my car so all in all I don't know why I brought that up but I want to be able to shoot things from my car well if you do have guns in your car you're gonna want the Peter Gunn theme but that song works too I didn't realize he did Revenge of Shinobi 2 dude he did a lot of great music anyway he did Actraiser?
7052321	7053002	That's sweet.
7053222	7059086	I knew that he did Shenmue and Streets of Rage and Sonic the Hedgehog, but I didn't realize he did Actrozer.
7060207	7062348	All right, Destination Blackout gets a nine from me.
7062389	7062889	I like that song.
7062909	7063269	It's pretty cool.
7063289	7065071	All right, let's get into the last pick.
7065111	7068113	It's my song tonight, and I don't know.
7068333	7071335	We've got two video game songs up tonight, but you know what?
7071395	7073657	I think that we should have something else.
7074492	7075374	Something else in the cage match.
7075394	7077356	So I went really kind of random tonight.
7077837	7082202	And this is a brand new synth pop song that's on a different drum site.
7082523	7083744	And so I had to check this one out.
7083804	7084705	And it's not in English.
7085066	7085847	So it should be interesting.
7086167	7091214	This is Silica Gel with Nada Es Eterno here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.
7100572	7105320	Even if he kisses us, nobody is perfect Nothing is eternal
7128286	7133888	How many nights, your lies, deceived me in every smile.
7133908	7137289	The caresses were not for me, your hands were now empty.
7137309	7142211	You have lost credibility, your kisses are no longer immortal.
7179625	7180345	S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft
7205453	7224861	Fueron a caer en mundos paralelos instantes No guardé rencor, no convertí en mi fe Poderte comprender Nada es eterno, aunque nos vende Nadie es perfecto
7320598	7325461	All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, Silica Gel with Nada Es Eterno.
7325701	7327522	Let's see what the hosts thought of that one.
7327562	7328122	DarkSakura.
7329643	7335146	What bothered me is I couldn't tell what language that was in because I didn't know if it was Spanish or Italian.
7335966	7337147	We're pretty sure it's Spanish.
7337827	7338948	I think it's Spanish.
7339328	7343750	But either way, I was baffled, and so bafflement takes the one from the score.
7344451	7345651	It was pretty good, though, overall.
7346752	7347252	So it gets an eight.
7347832	7348093	An eight.
7348573	7348773	Loki.
7348793	7348893	Loki.
7350812	7353414	Um... Ocho from DarkSakura.
7353614	7354034	I don't know.
7355755	7357456	I didn't really care for it at seven.
7358977	7362519	Okay, Siete from Loki.
7364340	7364641	Seis.
7365721	7366121	Seis.
7368963	7369323	Catchy.
7369363	7370504	I'm going to buck the trend here.
7370884	7373106	I'm going to give it an eight.
7373166	7374627	It was pretty good, pretty catchy.
7375987	7376808	Pretty, uh...
7377549	7378210	Pretty Lively.
7378590	7379190	Ocho!
7379491	7380812	From, uh... I hate you.
7384254	7387037	From, uh... 23, I think?
7387577	7387037	23?
7388258	7388618	Magus?
7388818	7389138	Alright.
7389679	7390019	Guy.
7391080	7392741	Uh... Nueve, for me.
7392901	7393862	Nueve, I like it.
7393882	7398886	The only language I can count in other than English, well, other than, like, Apple Map, is German.
7399727	7400567	I like that song.
7400627	7401208	It was cool.
7401288	7401948	So it gets a 9.
7402168	7406632	I think it's just kind of... It's very, like... It's got a strong beat to it.
7407202	7408703	I like the strong beat in that song.
7409303	7419748	Alright, let's go and see what the chatroom thought by allowing them to vote after this quick montage of the three songs you can vote for tonight.
7420528	7424390	Song number one tonight, Good Cool with Chorus K and Jeff Coot with Blame.
7435285	7454561	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout And song number three you can vote for tonight is Silica Gel with Nada S. Eterno
7463670	7467253	Alright, place vote now.
7467413	7476701	Send us a private message in the chat room to Sky with your vote for song number uno, song numero dos, or song numero tres.
7477462	7478083	Place vote now.
7480044	7480565	Alright.
7481437	7487402	Meanwhile, we get into the part of the show where Loki tells us what's going on in the simulation scene.
7487422	7496590	That's right, the Dance Dance Revolution simulation scene and other music games where you can download and simulate the music games for free on your PC.
7496710	7497671	Damn straight.
7498552	7501995	Of course, what we've been waiting for, Food Mix 2 has arrived.
7503296	7506278	It's unfortunately only in one format.
7506298	7507239	You can only download it in...
7509218	7512720	A set with basically Food Mix 1, Food Mix Plus, and Food Mix 2.
7513761	7516262	And that's a 1.2 gig download for you.
7517383	7521485	Wait, so it's Food Mix 1, 2, and... Yeah, it's 1, Plus, and 2.
7521845	7522506	Wow, okay.
7523546	7532872	And basically what they've done is they've changed all the animations in the background to just one video clip now instead of having all the fancy stuff that they were doing before.
7534162	7536623	But, I have to say, it's really cool.
7537023	7544106	The music this time around, though, a lot of it, I'm not too... I don't like it too much, but it's pretty good still.
7544427	7545947	And the animation is just amazing.
7546187	7548428	They've really just outdone themselves.
7549309	7554431	And the other thing, though, is they have a bunch of really strange stuff that's in there.
7554451	7557672	It kind of reminded me of old Moogle Hunter sim files.
7558053	7558673	It's really...
7559801	7564125	Really strange stuff that catches you off guard like steps appearing out of nowhere and stuff like that.
7564625	7566807	So it's interesting.
7566827	7567607	You've got to check it out.
7568868	7573672	And we have the link on our front page there, so definitely go check it out.
7574553	7574793	All right.
7575194	7575654	Check that out.
7577539	7584568	Also on the front page of OrangeLaunchRadio.com, something we hadn't mentioned yet until this point in the show, but I definitely want to make sure we get that out there.
7584748	7590556	It's something that we actually teamed up with another audio company in Sacramento, Dark Records.
7591277	7591837	And also...
7592678	7621202	Club 21, Rapture We're teaming up to do a fundraiser relief for Hurricane Katrina and kind of the concept behind this fundraiser is that we're not just trying to raise money for the human need but also the pet and animal need is kind of the little spin we're putting on it because I don't remember if it was you or Iguana Girl from DDR Freak slash Dark Record she works on as well that originally found the
7621912	7623234	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
7643624	7655469	Any type of animal care items, bedding, to give to the shelters, to the people who are housing, who are providing foster homes for displaced pets.
7658351	7663453	It's a lot easier for people who may not have a whole lot of money to contribute in food.
7664533	7670936	Also, we are taking monetary donations for the human survivors as well.
7671957	7672117	I'll
7672977	7674178	Did you already post the link?
7674378	7676779	Well, if you visit OrangeLawnTrailer.com, you can't miss it.
7676819	7677500	There's a huge banner.
7677520	7678040	It's right up at the top.
7678120	7678900	It's right up at the top.
7679721	7686985	But they're taking donations via PayPal on the Dark Records site that's set up for the collection.
7687105	7701093	Anyone in the Sacramento area, if you go to Club 21 on Thursday nights for Rapture, which is the goth industrial night, there are donation boxes around for physical items as well as...
7701860	7702881	Thank you for watching.
7703261	7704062	See you next time.
7709008	7713369	Get a fabulous garage sale.
7713869	7717130	And we are going to be selling off this stuff to the community.
7717730	7720671	And the money is going to be going directly to the Red Cross.
7720731	7724572	The leftover items are all going to the Salvation Army thrift store.
7725092	7727633	So everything donated will be put to use.
7728553	7733094	And if you have something specifically for animals, if the money you want to, you know,
7733720	7734181	www.DarkSakura.com
7748641	7749282	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
7772304	7786713	Yes, so now it's a little easier if you're in the local area to really get involved with this by going out to Club Rapture, checking out the garage sale that we're going to do that we have more information on later on.
7787034	7793518	Not just Sacramento, but our neighboring areas as well, Bay Area, Stockton, Modesto, those areas as well can certainly get in on this.
7794238	7800122	Our worldwide folks, because we know we have a lot of people that listen through obviously our live shows as well as the podcasts,
7800731	7807852	We do have that monetary donation thing basically set up just for you guys so you guys can get involved in this as well.
7807892	7811913	So we really hope, you know, obviously we don't want to force you guys, but think about it.
7811993	7819055	And I'll tell you what, if you want to send something to donate, you know, if you want to send pet supplies our way, email me.
7819415	7820855	I'll get you my address.
7821235	7823516	Or you could just contact your local SPCA, too.
7823536	7824316	You could do that, too.
7824396	7825536	See if they're doing something similar.
7825576	7828717	As long as the money or the items go to help.
7829137	7829317	Yeah.
7830556	7831716	That's all we're interested in.
7832177	7832537	Absolutely.
7832997	7834717	All right, so check that out on orangewatchradio.com.
7834737	7838038	We'll be mentioning that again every week until this is over because it's an important cause.
7838358	7838778	Absolutely.
7839619	7842760	All right, we're going to go to a break, guys, and I'm going to tally up the votes from the cage match.
7842780	7844740	So it is last call for cage match votes.
7844820	7845900	Last call for cage match votes.
7846321	7853783	And we're going to go to our break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match, and we'll do the FUs of the week when we come back.
7854283	7855463	And who knows what else is on our mind?
7855683	7855963	Loki.
7856743	7857984	I was just going to mention.
7858184	7858424	Okay.
7858444	7858524	Okay.
7859076	7865921	That my copy of In the Groove is coming, and for all those people that are concerned, oh, has he changed his mind?
7866021	7866181	No.
7866501	7870423	No, this is the one that I'm writing this game sucks on, and I think we'll be giving it away.
7870844	7874566	Yes, so Loki will be writing this game sucks on a copy of In the Groove.
7874626	7879409	Now, remember, the opinions of Loki do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Launch Radio or its staff.
7881150	7882151	It's Loki's opinion.
7882191	7884993	He's going to write this game sucks on a game, but hey, free game.
7885805	7886665	I share the opinion.
7888186	7890407	I'm not totally like-minded.
7890767	7892288	I halfway share the opinion.
7892468	7894189	There's half I like and half I don't like.
7894349	7895389	That's why I halfway share the opinion.
7895409	7896630	I might chew on the manual a bit.
7896670	7898571	I would put, this game kinda sucks.
7899171	7899952	How about this?
7900192	7902313	This game could be better, is what I would write.
7902353	7903033	This game could be better.
7903053	7904114	I want to burn part of the manual.
7904734	7905374	Alright, anyway.
7905394	7905874	I'll be allowed on it.
7906355	7907175	Anyway, kids.
7908060	7908961	We'll be giving that away.
7909021	7909662	So free game.
7910003	7911545	Whether you like it in the groove or not, free game.
7911725	7914389	I will personally run over the box with my car for you.
7914449	7914970	Alright.
7915751	7919196	We're going to break.
7919216	7921720	We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
7922040	7923302	Start off with some colors from 2DX.
7940583	7941607	Thanks for watching!
8005298	8005899	Thanks for watching!
8053660	8054706	Thanks for watching!
8086747	8087507	Thanks for watching!
8188450	8189320	Nothing to say
8244215	8245336	Thank you for watching.
8305558	8306504	Thank you for watching!
8365782	8374369	Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.
8374589	8381015	We're back, kids!
8381375	8382076	Did you miss us?
8382636	8383437	Orange Lounge Radio?
8383677	8384218	Here, shut up.
8384638	8385158	In studio.
8386720	8394086	In that break, colors, quickening, drifting, I didn't even realize I inadvertently put two Taka songs back to back, but whatever, deal.
8394918	8408299	Drifting Away and Beautiful Days by the one and only Fantastic Plastic Machine I found Fantastic Plastic Machine doing something that's on a compilation that's got gorillas on it too, I think
8409295	8410136	You nerd.
8410616	8413198	But I saw it on something else, though.
8413398	8418042	It's like something that Fantastic Plastic Machine's doing with... Crap.
8418342	8419123	It was at Target.
8419303	8420244	It wasn't Gorillaz, actually.
8420264	8422346	I was looking for another compilation.
8422366	8423387	If it's Target, I want it.
8423527	8424848	It wasn't Target, it was at Best Buy.
8425228	8426049	Target is so sexy.
8426069	8426849	Well, fuck Best Buy.
8426909	8427370	No, I'm kidding.
8427450	8427750	I'm kidding.
8427810	8428931	I buy stuff at Best Buy.
8428971	8433295	I can't remember what it was, but it was another Fantastic Plastic Machine song on this random compilation.
8433315	8433915	I almost bought it.
8434456	8436017	It sounds like good music for commercials.
8436932	8437193	Really?
8437413	8442204	The whole CD, though, the beautiful CD by Fantastic Plastic Machine, is just interesting.
8442404	8443687	But it has Take Me to the Disco on it.
8443707	8444268	That's what was cool.
8444509	8445752	I went cage match with that once.
8446032	8446293	You did?
8447580	8449240	Let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?
8449621	8450761	I remember that banner.
8450801	8452021	That's the awesomest banner.
8452041	8452581	I need to use that again.
8452601	8456102	I'm going through all my old banners, and I found one I made for Rob with Bob Barker on it.
8456122	8457583	And it says, The Sky is Right.
8457963	8458683	I have that font, though.
8458703	8459603	You should link our chatroom to that.
8459623	8460023	It's great.
8460364	8464625	The only reason I don't use that anymore is because now I whore Orange Lounge Radio and my banners on all the websites.
8464685	8466605	I still have to see him before he dies.
8466805	8469626	Bob Barker, next year before E3, since you get to go now.
8470446	8472227	I can't go before E3, remember?
8473227	8476248	And there's a lot of stipulations because I'm getting married.
8476728	8477609	Bitch!
8479069	8480030	I'm kidding, I love Nelly.
8480050	8481710	But what a bitch!
8485511	8489593	You know, I'm going to be lucky if I get to go this time.
8490293	8490873	I know, I know.
8492614	8493794	Nobody's making you get married.
8494395	8496195	Except maybe your fiance.
8496215	8501097	I don't see why you can't do the cheap DMV style one like me and Dan did.
8501909	8504130	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
8531667	8537152	Tonight's winner was... Destination Blackout!
8540474	8543397	Handful of votes, though, for song number one, Blame.
8543937	8546359	Not so many votes for Nada Es Eterno.
8546919	8548721	I guess you guys just aren't feeling the love.
8550022	8552524	Alright, so DarkSakura wins tonight's cage match.
8552624	8554346	She doesn't have to pick a new song last week.
8554566	8555987	That means I can sleep in next week.
8556187	8559670	I don't think I've won a cage match now in about three months.
8560669	8561990	So I'm getting mad.
8562070	8563111	You should pick better songs.
8563651	8564772	You can suck my dick.
8564832	8566494	Something is really fucked up.
8567414	8572058	Well, last week was supposed to be the fucked up thing, but it got a ton of votes.
8572578	8575561	All three songs last week were very close and very narrowly lost.
8575921	8578423	So now I'm just going to have to get really, really fucked up.
8578483	8581305	I have another song that is just god-awful bad.
8582106	8588511	It's the worst thing I've found on the iTunes Music Store, and I'm going to play it next week, I think, out of spite for our listeners.
8589668	8591230	But at least my song got a couple votes.
8591290	8591931	That makes me happy.
8591951	8593793	At least it got a couple votes, so I'm not as mad.
8595435	8595875	All right.
8597397	8600221	DarkSakura, we've been teasing this a little bit throughout tonight's show.
8600301	8603284	You have gotten yourself into a brand new MMO.
8603544	8603945	What is it?
8604759	8606040	I'm playing World of Warcraft.
8606200	8607621	World of Warcraft!
8607641	8609061	About time one of us did.
8609201	8614244	I know, World of Warcraft is a huge game and nobody's really, none of the three of us have really gotten into it yet.
8614264	8615144	It's so pretty.
8615364	8616385	Yeah, I heard it's a pretty game.
8616745	8618646	What made you decide you want to start playing World of Warcraft?
8618686	8620007	Because I know a bunch of people who play it.
8620267	8620447	Yeah?
8620947	8622188	And it's not Final Fantasy XI.
8622688	8624149	Hey now, watch it, watch it.
8624469	8630552	I'm sorry, I gave Final Fantasy XI a humongous try and I hated being forced to.
8631118	8636981	into hanging out with a bunch of people that I didn't know and healing their stupid, ungrateful asses.
8637021	8640903	That's people's major bitch about Final Fantasy XI is the forced partying.
8640923	8642783	I don't have to do that in World of Warcraft.
8642843	8644744	If I played a hunter, I could have a pet crocodile.
8647085	8647666	Crogies!
8647706	8650287	It's a pet crocodile!
8650987	8652948	Who was that guy, the crocodile hunter, that had his movie?
8652988	8653228	What?
8654549	8654929	Erwin!
8656210	8656990	That guy was hilarious.
8658585	8662847	I'm playing a night elf druid because I want to turn into a kitty.
8664908	8665648	That's really it.
8665668	8667589	I was like, ooh, I can turn into a cat.
8667689	8671671	Okay, I think it's time.
8671831	8673051	That's cool.
8673171	8677613	And Magus, who's been playing World of Warcraft for a while, is over there going, don't do that, it sucks.
8677953	8678453	It sucks.
8679034	8680514	Seriously, cat form sucks.
8681695	8682055	Alright.
8682235	8687437	But it looked like druids have a lot of neat stuff that they can do later on, so I'm looking forward to it.
8688012	8688812	Alright, very cool.
8691093	8691393	Loki.
8692714	8694354	I will not be playing World of Warcraft.
8695075	8702297	And as of right now, it's like I'm not really going to be playing Final Fantasy XI either, because I just can't seem to find time to get on there.
8704218	8704598	I don't know.
8705498	8710000	I get distracted by all these things, like, you know, movies... Real life?
8710880	8712301	Pussy, yes, exactly.
8713581	8715542	Burnout Revenge, um...
8716656	8719878	and I still have to play Magic Penjel, or not Magic Penjel, Graffiti Kingdom.
8720318	8722419	I bought that game like a while ago and I had to play it.
8722439	8724460	You know, I have your Magic Penjel game.
8725361	8729142	Sorry, I have my version of the hard drive.
8729162	8731043	I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.
8731063	8734905	Speaking of which, I still have your DDR Max 2, I think.
8734965	8736886	I want that back.
8736927	8741649	I don't know how we ended up with two US copies of it, I mean, because, but whatever.
8741977	8743558	I've been playing Pump It Up lately.
8743838	8747521	If you listened to last week's show, I'm kind of liking Pump It Up, believe it or not, on Xbox.
8747561	8748281	No, it's really good.
8748561	8749282	Like, I know, I know.
8749402	8754205	Even if I were listening to myself like three weeks ago, I would have said, Rob, you're smoking dope.
8754605	8757647	But no, it's really a fun dance game on the home version.
8757767	8758168	I know!
8758728	8759529	Stop looking at me like that!
8760049	8760249	What?
8761190	8761470	I know.
8762130	8763511	You know what else no one's playing?
8764031	8764452	In the group.
8765837	8766297	Shut up.
8767098	8767699	All right.
8767719	8772925	Honestly, though, I did see In the Groove at Best Buy, and it had dust on it.
8775007	8776328	You guys are awful.
8776448	8777510	I'm going to go pour dust on them.
8777550	8778711	I know, I'm being very serious.
8779171	8779312	No.
8779372	8781434	You guys are just ruthless.
8781494	8785919	I don't care about In the Groove, because I'm over it.
8786459	8786880	It's done.
8788502	8788862	All right.
8788882	8792226	I heard they cut the price of it, though.
8792666	8794128	Or is that just on DDR Freak?
8794308	8795650	It's a sale that's going on.
8795690	8796350	It's not DDR Freak.
8796370	8797151	It's just Red Octane.
8797171	8799153	They clear out their extra copies they aren't selling.
8799273	8801155	And, you know, I bought one.
8801676	8802497	So I'm only helping.
8804938	8805598	I know, isn't it?
8806259	8814444	If you think about it, even though Loki is saying how much he hates this game and stuff, he just helped them out by buying a copy legitimately just to give away to somebody.
8814484	8819447	So you can't hate him too much in the group of fans because he ended up supporting your game after all.
8819727	8821628	So taunt him relentlessly over that.
8822048	8822568	Doesn't matter.
8823329	8823669	All right.
8824437	8830081	Alright kids, it's that time of the show where we're going to get a little bit angsty and it's time to get into the FUs of the week.
8830101	8832223	So if you have some FUs of the week, send those on over to me.
8832623	8836346	And DarkSakura, why do we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?
8836566	8837527	Grr, argh.
8843992	8852959	The big FU goes toward the flu or whatever the fuck it was I had because I was miserable and now I'm still getting weird fatigue from it too.
8853863	8865507	So, an FU goes to having a geography exam on Wednesday, but on the same day I have to get my ass up at like 4.30 in the morning to get Dan to the airport at 6.
8865567	8871489	So he can fly off to a big ol' happy GameStop video game manager conference and get free shit.
8871809	8874650	Well, I have to go to work that morning, dammit.
8875351	8879252	And have to deal with a 30 minute lunch and then an exam afterwards that I really don't want to go to.
8879332	8880572	Thank you very much.
8881533	8881613	Um...
8884037	8900783	and an FU goes to being told I was going to be prescribed antibiotics for the sinus infection part of what I had and then going all the way to the pharmacy to find out, oh no, I'm sorry, they didn't prescribe that and then telling them to refill my decongestant and having them not do it, just refill my ibuprofen instead.
8901823	8902263	Buttheads.
8904964	8913287	And another FU goes toward people who like to just try to kill me while I'm driving, you know, I think that they're retards.
8915123	8916904	FU to InTheGroove because it bites.
8918205	8918565	What?
8921728	8930354	And FU to, for some reason, World of Warcraft is not letting me use my controller and I haven't seen anything on how to set up a controller config on it.
8931315	8935077	That is the biggest piece of shit I have ever heard in my entire life.
8941422	8942963	Actually, I do the point-click mouse thingy.
8943738	8945239	Um, which is like playing Ragnarok.
8946320	8951262	But, uh... Okay, I'm gonna be sending some hate mail to Blizzard.
8952243	8952943	So, that's it.
8953984	8956445	Alright, let's get to Loki and his FUs of the week.
8957786	8962569	Blizzard does, though, have the chicken quest where you can get a pet chicken to follow you around, which is kind of fun.
8962689	8963570	Type slash chicken.
8964150	8967492	Anyways, um... Yeah.
8967932	8969393	Oh yeah, an FU to that guy on Dig.
8973311	8975253	Okay, Monkey Balls, or what was his name?
8975813	8977034	Yeah, Monkey Balls!
8977074	8977615	Monkey Butter?
8977635	8977995	I don't remember.
8978015	8979276	Monkey Butt Butler.
8979716	8981077	Monkey Butler, okay, whatever.
8981137	8982138	Okay, anyways.
8983239	8985941	The only Monkey Butler I can think of is Brett Butler.
8986382	8993988	But, um, no, um, so first off, fuck you to stupid old people that can't drive the speed limit.
8994488	8997891	You know the type, the ones that are pulling out of the church parking lot on Sundays?
8998652	8999032	Fucking...
8999571	9003292	They have the glory of God holding the breakdown on the goddamn car.
9003853	9005633	So, fuck you to them.
9005894	9007574	They should burn in hell.
9008214	9012236	Also, I want to say fuck you to the Kia Rio dealership.
9012876	9017958	Or basically, yeah, Folsom Lake Kia over here in Folsom, California.
9018018	9021600	Because they did not have goddamn pretzels in their snack machine.
9021640	9026262	So I had to settle for some cheddar sour cream ruffles.
9026562	9026682	And...
9027302	9029603	The fucking machine didn't give me any change back.
9029963	9031524	Just like a normal car salesman.
9032544	9033225	So fuck them.
9034385	9036806	And, um, let's see what else.
9036946	9043129	Oh, also, um, fuck you the fact that I don't have enough time to play all these games that I'm getting for free.
9043809	9044750	Oh, you poor thing.
9046331	9046771	Poor me.
9046951	9047511	Give it to me!
9047831	9048792	I did nothing this week!
9048892	9049252	Nothing!
9050492	9052393	You played fucking Final Fantasy XI.
9053154	9053994	I fucking wouldn't have.
9054014	9055955	I had something else to play.
9057481	9058122	No, I'm just kidding.
9058542	9059803	Miklatov guilted me into it.
9059863	9060463	What can I say?
9061944	9063065	So, yeah.
9063185	9064186	There was something else here.
9066088	9066348	Whatever.
9066368	9067328	I can't remember it.
9067749	9070171	Just, you know, mainly fuck you old people for driving slow.
9072212	9074814	And those people that don't signal, fuck them too.
9075274	9079598	I hate those people that need to weave through traffic to get, like, five seconds ahead of everybody else.
9080178	9085162	And fuck the people who actually try to change lanes into the spot that you exactly are existing in right now.
9086397	9089399	or the ones that pretend that your car's not there and don't let you in when you're signaling.
9090480	9091881	Those are usually the people that I cut off.
9092081	9093042	That's usually me, actually.
9094783	9095684	Alright, I'm done.
9102809	9104610	An F you to my washer because...
9105217	9133739	it constantly gets my clothes off balance like every time I do a load of laundry in there it starts spinning and it sounds like the psycho washer from hell because it's going vroom vroom vroom vroom vroom and we live upstairs mind you so I know those people that live downstairs are not happy with us there's nothing you can do and an F you to myself for forgetting that I need to go to the washer and take my clothes and put them in the dryer because they've been sitting in the washer for about oh three hours now so way to go Rob smart smart thing and now nice and mildewy fresh will my clothes be
9135985	9138087	That's it, I'm short on FUs tonight, that's it.
9138627	9143151	So let's get to our guests tonight, starting off with Bugged and his FUs of the week.
9143611	9144592	FU to Hooters, actually.
9145152	9148195	Not for the boobs and cleavage, but for using MSG on their wings.
9148275	9148915	Gave me a migraine.
9149235	9150516	They use MSG on their wings?
9150817	9155060	Yeah, well, between my brother and his two friends and I, we went through 50 wings.
9155741	9156721	Oh my god!
9158002	9161245	But my brother's my size, and so are his friends.
9163359	9165080	So yeah, that was the beginning of my week.
9165140	9168563	Monday was go to Hooters, have wings, have migraine for the next two days.
9168763	9170585	F you to the line at Hooters being way too long.
9171065	9171566	Walked right in.
9172426	9172706	When?
9172967	9173227	Monday.
9173847	9174308	Monday night?
9174508	9175909	No, Monday afternoon.
9176129	9176269	Oh.
9176429	9176890	Three, four.
9177050	9177610	See, that's why.
9178111	9178831	I'm going to try going to Hooters.
9178851	9179592	F you to working, huh?
9180092	9180493	Yeah.
9180533	9181774	Hooters is kind of icky anyway.
9182134	9185517	Hooters is a little bit overrated, but there's something... I can't explain that.
9185617	9188819	I know what some of you guys that have been listening to this show for a while are thinking.
9188879	9189740	Rob, you're gay.
9189780	9190881	What's the deal with Hooters?
9192459	9193159	I can't explain it.
9193179	9194579	It's the same reason I go to strip clubs.
9194639	9195580	Boobies are hilarious.
9196680	9199580	We fought through a crowd to get to Hooters.
9200000	9200400	We did.
9200520	9201161	A concert.
9201361	9201721	We did.
9201761	9210042	When we were at E3 in LA, randomly that Thursday or Friday night, I think it was the Thursday night of E3, we were on Hollywood Boulevard, our hotel, right?
9210182	9214483	Audio Slave was having a free concert in the middle of the fucking street.
9214783	9219864	We had to cut through a crowd to get to Hooters, which was empty, of course, because of the...
9224025	9231231	My whole thing about Hooters is the same thing about fucking Krispy Kreme.
9231872	9233113	I grew up with this stuff.
9233954	9235155	It's not special.
9236876	9237717	But it's new.
9238530	9240751	It's not special and it's not new.
9240771	9249713	To those of you guys in the rest of America, understand, Sacramento is, and I seriously think I read this somewhere, Sacramento is the only major city in the nation that has not had a Hooters until this year.
9250433	9252973	The real reason to rejoice is if we get Waffle House.
9253834	9255594	I would also like, or Shoney's.
9256454	9258495	Shoney's, Waffle House.
9258535	9259075	Bob Evans.
9259502	9264284	We need Shoney's, Waffle House, and... But you East Coast Cracker Barrel.
9264724	9267185	Cracker Barrel by... Oh, please, please.
9267705	9269506	Cracker Barrel's a little bit overrated to me.
9269526	9274428	There's three places that I just named off for not within driving distance unless I feel like taking three days to get there.
9274848	9275248	I don't know.
9275548	9277049	Cracker Barrel's in Salt Lake City.
9277089	9277769	That's only 12 hours.
9277789	9284372	But you East Coast people... You East Coast people can keep your Hardee's because Carl's Jr.
9284412	9285192	is way better than Hardee's.
9285560	9287260	It's the same fucking restaurant.
9287280	9288041	No, it's way better here.
9288161	9289361	They're owned by the same people.
9289381	9290741	And you don't have Jack in the Box, so neither do you.
9290761	9292642	But you can't get fried chicken or biscuits and gravy.
9292842	9293942	Alright, alright.
9293982	9296703	Let's let Bug finish.
9296723	9299143	An F you to Apple for the iPod Nano.
9299803	9313847	It's so damn sexy and looks so nice and it's really damn small and it doesn't support my most useful item I have for my 20 gig, which is the wireless remote where I don't have to actually look at the machine or the iPod.
9313867	9315327	Alright.
9315691	9316191	It's kind of crummy.
9316751	9317231	It looks nice.
9318372	9319672	And the headphone port's on the bottom.
9319692	9320552	It's really strange looking.
9322773	9323613	Alright, Magus.
9325093	9327554	Alright, you know I've had these saved up for a long time.
9328114	9329794	Make it quick, it's a three hour show.
9330675	9331915	Three hours, who'd guess?
9332515	9334535	No pulling in explicit, thank you.
9335096	9336296	Alright, alright, alright.
9336876	9339237	First off, fuck you to the state of Massachusetts.
9339437	9341217	Yes, the entire fucking state.
9341677	9345238	Especially the pharmacies and the hospitals and the doctor's offices.
9345888	9350290	We give you a number to call if you have problems looking up eligibility.
9350991	9352392	We give you a number to call.
9353172	9355273	Don't give it to the goddamn patients.
9355933	9356514	They call.
9356834	9357895	We can't help you.
9358235	9358955	Move along.
9359395	9362197	Call the number you're supposed to call.
9362677	9365058	Do not give them our number.
9365399	9366759	We don't help with that shit.
9368060	9370481	Nobody on the internet knows what you're talking about right now, but that's okay.
9370721	9372602	That's what this is all about.
9372943	9373543	Second of all,
9374110	9392102	Fuck you to these PVP server rejects that think they're gonna roll on the new World of Warcraft PVP roleplay servers, which are basically roleplay naming policies and in-character stuff with player versus player contested area rules.
9393402	9399806	Now, you have these people harassing roleplayers left and right and then saying, we're exploiting the rules against them.
9400447	9403609	Hello, if you didn't break the rules, you wouldn't get busted for them.
9404218	9405499	Likewise to forums.
9406019	9408240	You don't break the rules, you don't ban forums.
9409480	9411041	Are you a mod on GameFAQs yet?
9412181	9413602	No, I got passed off.
9413662	9418624	I had something about logging in from work they didn't like.
9419344	9419764	Oh, whatever.
9419904	9420645	User map issues.
9420665	9422405	I'm going to try again next time, though.
9423906	9424906	Still big on GameFAQs.
9425246	9425907	Okay.
9426367	9426887	Let's see.
9427868	9433970	Yeah, fuck you to the PvP noobs who think roleplay is lame and gay and all that kind of shit and like
9434841	9437361	Hello, you're just going to get banned for, what, three days?
9438202	9439042	Give it a fucking rest.
9439922	9440102	Out.
9442142	9442402	Angel?
9442522	9443023	No FUs?
9443563	9443763	Angel?
9443823	9445163	I'm going to give an Angel on behalf.
9445183	9445743	He's not AC enough.
9445763	9447423	I'm going to give an FU on behalf of Angel.
9447944	9453405	FU to all that walking around Angel did at the convention because she's sore and you can tell she's tired as hell.
9453505	9454945	All right, I'll relay one for her.
9455125	9459006	FU to hotel beds and to getting lost in the middle of hotels.
9459966	9460526	That do it for you?
9461371	9462872	Okay, okay, that was a personal FU.
9462892	9465314	Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.
9465675	9466776	Oh, I gotta tag one on.
9466996	9467136	What?
9467156	9469398	F you to my DS for not having a sound system.
9470439	9471420	It's simply gone.
9471600	9471840	Agreed.
9472708	9474709	We just had a net split in our chatroom by the way.
9476130	9478152	You have the Helen Keller of DS's.
9478432	9479453	Alright, here we go.
9480413	9486798	Misty says, F you to me fucking up my knee and not having a clue as to how the hell I did it and having to kind of limp around during work.
9486818	9492181	F you to having to work today period because the Arnold Days Parade being the same day as my mom's union picnic.
9492502	9498466	I would give you one for the parade itself but I got a minimum of an hour of being stuck in drive-thru without actually having to take drive-thru orders.
9500103	9506845	Zaku says, F you to State University Police for thinking I, a Hispanic, took their barricade to my place when my roommate actually took it.
9507746	9512467	That's like one time I got busted in college for smoking pot, and it was my roommate, and the bastard left.
9513147	9519009	He left, and like, not even five seconds later, I walk in, and I smell pot, and then my door's open, and my RA walks by, and he smells pot.
9519029	9520130	He's like, Rob, you didn't smoke a pot?
9520490	9522691	I'm like, do I look like... Oh, so mad.
9523151	9525191	When my roommate was so obviously a pothead.
9525492	9526672	He was such a pothead!
9530115	9530775	That's how he laughed.
9531055	9533676	He had that total storm laugh.
9534696	9537317	We just had the bottles of booze hidden in my closet.
9537457	9537697	Anyway.
9538017	9542158	Zaku also says, F you to Tokyo Game Action for going to great lengths to get Happy Sky.
9542438	9545559	Konami is going to blacklist the person who gave it to you, so enjoy it while it lasts.
9546019	9548940	F you to snitches in general for their snitching ways and ruining all the fun.
9550520	9551481	I'll say it.
9551661	9552321	I'll say it, Loki.
9553181	9553541	Loki!
9555742	9556202	You snitch!
9557557	9559178	Oh yeah, like I ruined it for everybody.
9559278	9567785	Sakurina, the Papa Music Iroha whore, says, F you to my brother for not covering his mouth when he throws up everywhere, splashing me with vomit.
9567925	9569826	Oh my god, that's disgusting!
9570307	9571627	What kind of kinky shit are they, aren't they?
9571848	9572808	I know, gross.
9573009	9575150	I got puked on in a casino once that way.
9576751	9580794	Random person walking by just started puking on everything, including the people nearby.
9580814	9581175	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
9582841	9588603	An FU to the fucker on Digg who called Rob, Jamie, Takash, I don't know what Takash is, the ditzy girl.
9590684	9596026	DarkTetsuya says FU to G4 for ruining the concept of MMO Oregon Trail and a final FU to AOL.
9596086	9596806	Can't say I miss it.
9597486	9597726	What?
9597866	9600107	Did they do an MMO Oregon Trail thing on G4?
9600768	9601028	What?
9601468	9602348	That was our joke.
9602808	9603709	That was our joke.
9604049	9604329	What?
9604409	9604629	What?
9605734	9606214	Dark Knight
9627799	9629960	Dark Knight, did I just say Dark and Knight?
9629980	9634002	Because I was reading in the chatroom somebody had just written Papini Roja, and I said Dark and Knight.
9634842	9641565	Dark Knight says, F you to six fucking days of work coming to me, and F you having a free laptop and no power cord to plug it into.
9643386	9648768	Acer800 says, F you for having a history test to study for and English essay to write in the same week.

9676192	9677673	I got a big bingo from, uh...
9679693	9685139	Megas, Goggle, not Google, but Goggle, says F you to people who call me Google.
9685820	9686961	I'm not a search engine.
9687962	9688563	I say Goggle.
9691586	9693568	AZ Modius, I hope I said that right.
9694483	9695003	Asmodeus?
9695103	9695543	Oh, I'm sorry.
9695823	9696463	Is that a character?
9696503	9697924	It's the name of a demon, actually.
9697984	9698444	Asmodeus.
9698504	9700244	Oh, well, hell, somebody knows they're demons.
9700664	9709526	Alright, F you to Ikaruga for being too fucking hard, having that huge-ass fish on the third stage, and that guy who beat it on hard without dying.
9710426	9711686	Just turn your screen sideways.

9724957	9726499	that have a dance beat label at Techno.
9726799	9730402	Go back to listen to your stupid punk pop rock and mediocre hip hop bullshit.
9732503	9734405	I have... I have... Hold on.
9735185	9735406	What?
9735666	9738128	I have the update on the Oregon Trail thing.
9738188	9739249	Alright, wait.
9739349	9739709	After this.
9740570	9749437	Rini says, F you to bad posture because my entire lower arm is hurting and one for my iPod because OLR interrupts my good streaks of songs when the thing's on shuffle songs.
9752099	9753660	Sorry to ruin your day.
9754426	9759028	Zaku says, F you to the Nintendo Revolution Controller for being a fake-ass anti-fighter game phaser.
9759088	9762630	Nintendo should set their revolution phaser on stun and sodomize themselves with it.
9765131	9765931	Only on the internet.
9766832	9769833	SSJ100Matt says, F you to the Yankees not in the playoffs.
9770253	9771254	Yeah, let's go Yankees.
9773675	9775076	Alright, that's it, that's it.
9775596	9777597	Alright, what's the fa- I wanna know, what the hell?
9777737	9777937	Did G-
9778430	9780010	to G4 Yanker Idea.
9780250	9780791	What the fuck?
9780811	9782111	No, it's kind of retarded.
9782311	9782851	Oh, okay.
9783211	9789533	What it is is the show hosts, they're playing, it's almost like, you know, like playing an actual role-playing game.
9789973	9793914	They're on, basically the users are giving them what they're supposed to do.
9793934	9800355	Like, for example, they had just tried to cross a river and cocked their wagon and it tipped over and now Sarah's dead.
9801055	9803076	So it's one of the hosts is dead now.
9803616	9803936	It's just,
9805129	9807011	It doesn't even sound like they're trying to do anything.
9807031	9808072	Okay, so it's not an MMO.
9808252	9809493	No, it's not an actual game.
9809553	9810914	It's just something fun they're doing on forums.
9810934	9812215	I'm putting the phone down then.
9812355	9813216	We don't have to call the lawyers.
9814377	9815077	I'll put the phone down.
9815958	9817780	But I was a little irritated there for a minute.
9818060	9820722	I thought my rights was feeling violated there a little bit.
9821343	9831311	See, because day one, what they do, it says, we started on an on-set game of the classic role-playing game, Oregon Trail, and we want you to play along with us.
9832091	9833312	And it says, so basically...
9835114	9838056	Basically what they've done is they're just actually doing it.
9838116	9844261	They're playing the actual game in studio or whatever when naming all the people as the host names.
9844921	9848744	And so then they're basically having the users tell them what to do next.
9850125	9850445	Okay.
9850925	9851746	That's all it is.
9851806	9855008	We could do that too if we wanted to, but we've got better things to do with our time.
9855508	9855889	Exactly.
9855909	9858290	When I play Oregon Trail, I want my own private game.
9858310	9859771	I don't want you people telling me what to do with it.
9860172	9864495	We need to mod Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to play Oregon Trail on.
9864515	9864735	Oh.
9866656	9869497	Alright kids, you guys have been asking for it.
9869537	9873179	It's been like a month since we've been able to do this.
9873239	9875860	We are going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.
9876220	9881602	Send a private message to Sky with any question you want to ask us and we'll get to those questions as soon as this break is over.
9881622	9885584	We're going to start it off with a little bit of Taku in this break with Electro-Tuned.
9885624	9885864	Enjoy.
9988386	9994873	Night is the night, funky music is the night Oh, do you wanna funky music?
9995313	10000619	Everybody funky music Night is the night, funky music is the night Oh, do you wanna funky music?
10018655	10019498	Thank you for watching!
10056838	10057819	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,
10091329	10100692	And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
10101435	10105517	Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
10105538	10106498	Can we talk about that?
10106778	10109120	No subject will ever be taboo.
10109420	10113042	Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
10113582	10116104	Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
10116624	10121967	Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
10122527	10123808	I collect your fucking head.
10125777	10127258	Just like this fucker here.
10128359	10132042	Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
10132342	10135684	The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
10136645	10143089	Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
10144330	10148033	Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
10150956	10155559	In that break, electro-tuned and from Puppet Up, Funky Tonight, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge.
10159862	10162784	Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
10163344	10166627	What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?
10167067	10171670	It's been a little while since we've done this segment with new listeners.
10171750	10173992	Tonight should be a barrel of monkeys fun.
10178014	10179255	A barrel of monkeys fun?
10179275	10180316	That's right, a barrel of monkeys fun.
10180592	10181793	Remember those little barrel of monkeys?
10181833	10184454	Yeah, but it's a monkey's fun.
10186976	10191119	VXJasonXV, our one and only webmaster, starts us off tonight.
10191599	10195061	Orange Lounge, why does Wyoming suck so freaking badly?
10195922	10198123	You know, we might have a listener or two from Wyoming.
10198143	10199784	Isn't that where Jackson Hole is?
10199844	10201025	That's right, Jackson Hole is there.
10201065	10202086	That would be why it sucks.
10202589	10204391	No, I... It's very green.
10204411	10205111	It is a large hole.
10205371	10207773	It's... The reason why it sucks is because nobody lives there.
10208294	10209194	So there's not a lot to do.
10209695	10210215	Unless you like snow.
10210235	10210696	You know what?
10210876	10211476	But it's very pretty.
10211656	10211997	You know what?
10212137	10212337	What?
10212797	10214018	My mother-in-law was born in Wyoming.
10215319	10218682	I've been across Wyoming three times and I stopped like four times.
10220183	10222045	And most of those stops were at Little America.
10222065	10222565	Yay, 35 cent ice cream.
10226125	10235934	Dark Tetsuya, what licensed Konami original DDR song would you girls and guys most like to see in Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3?
10235974	10238736	Anybody want to kick us off?
10238776	10241799	What licensed song do you really want to see in Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3?
10242439	10244341	I would like new Echo Image, Kthanks.
10244721	10245982	Neverending Story, Kthanks.
10247543	10248985	DarkSakura, Loki, anything?
10250926	10251527	Get Loki a mic.
10252705	10254985	I'm sure you need a mic.
10255346	10261527	I would have to say, I think we need some Ultimate Cheeseburger in there.
10263507	10264747	The Ultimate Cheeseburger song?
10266948	10268448	Debbie Gibson's Electric Blue.
10269528	10271269	Don't you mean Electric Youth?
10271309	10272009	Electric Youth, yeah.
10272069	10273369	I was thinking of Into the Blue.
10274229	10274689	I got one.
10275170	10276210	What?
10276270	10277610	Might not have heard it, though.
10277670	10280691	Expansion Union, playing with lightning.
10280731	10282411	You may have heard it on the movie Blade.
10291194	10294997	Legend of Zaku wants to know, how come girls love the smell of Axe body spray?
10295637	10298139	And as a gay male, I can tell you, it's not only the girls.
10300920	10301901	That's all I'll say about that.
10302461	10307564	Being a Hispanic, do you have any good pickup lines for picking up white chicks?
10309326	10311487	DarkSakura, I'll defer that question to you.
10311963	10313723	Have any good lines for picking up white chicks?
10317844	10319224	Who's Hispanic here?
10320064	10321745	Legend of Zaku is a Hispanic.
10321765	10322365	Which one of us?
10322705	10325585	You're a white chick, so you should know what pickup lines would work on you.
10325605	10325965	I'm married!
10326365	10330966	Well, but imagine it's, you know, five years ago before, how long have you known Dan?
10331166	10331546	Five years?
10331986	10332286	Six years?
10332547	10333427	Imagine it's seven years ago.
10333447	10335327	I've known Dan for ten years.
10335347	10338588	Okay, then eleven years ago, what was a pickup line that would have worked on you?
10338648	10341088	Eleven years ago, I was like in high school.
10341735	10342396	Okay, I'll tell you that.
10342436	10342756	Here it is.
10342856	10343116	Here it is.
10344037	10346239	Hey baby, I like peanut butter.
10346439	10347200	Wanna fuck?
10348120	10348501	There it is.
10348721	10349241	That's simple.
10350202	10355626	It's called Be Genuine, Don't Be an Asshole, and Don't Go Hey Chica.
10358269	10361651	Because yeah, that actually has been tried on me before and I shot that down.
10361992	10362272	All right.
10365261	10366401	And Don't Day Girls in Wyoming.
10366701	10371925	Socorino wants to know, why isn't G-Deca the song for chatroom FUs or any FUs at all?
10372305	10374146	I have used that before.
10374526	10376848	It rotates for the chatroom FUs, the song every week.
10377528	10381391	Will the Orange Lounge Radio crew sign a copy of In the Groove if I send one to them?
10381731	10383052	Sure, but that doesn't mean we'll send it back.
10384393	10385794	And a special... No, we will.
10385814	10387595	Will we sign it?
10391148	10391989	Yeah, I guess.
10392049	10394771	Alright, yeah, we will, but we don't take responsibility for what we write on it.
10396212	10397613	But what will you sign it with?
10399495	10400075	My dick!
10401876	10404038	Yes, I'll rub my fat cock against it.
10407400	10408841	Two fat cocks, rubbing together.
10409502	10409662	Oil.
10410983	10411343	Forget it.
10411383	10412864	Bad Orange Lounge Radio inside joke.
10413845	10415306	And a special question for Loki.
10415366	10420270	What do you think of the subliminal anal sex if you wear polarized lenses while playing Graffiti Kingdom?
10423251	10423471	What?
10426092	10433734	Granted, there would be some characters we might draw that look like, you know, anal sex, but, um, what?
10438255	10440816	Acer800 wants to know, what's monkeys fun?
10441156	10443056	Oh, and what's the square root of 443,556?
10443697	10447638	Uh, get a calculator.
10448418	10449978	Seriously, just get a calculator.
10450298	10452619	In fact, actually, I think I have one on my desktop here, if I can
10453379	10461785	Fire up the calculator program here, and I will switch that over to the scientific mode, because scientific mode will allow me to do square roots here.
10461825	10462485	It has more buttons.
10462725	10465147	It has more buttons, that means it must work better, right?
10465487	10468269	So, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 6, where's the square root button?
10468549	10469470	I know it's on here somewhere, right?
10470070	10470670	Oh, shit.
10470690	10470670	6, 6, 6.
10471911	10472272	Shit.
10472772	10473793	Is it 6, 6, 6, really?
10475133	10476154	Damn you, bugs, damn you.
10477175	10478856	Ha, ha, ha, 6, 6, 6, devil joke.
10481275	10484077	MPQ, is there any point in playing 2DX one-handed?
10485718	10486819	So you can masturbate with the other.
10491722	10497385	Dark Knight wants to know, okay cast, what do you think was the best Orange Lounge Radio bad joke of all time?
10497445	10498746	Let me rephrase that, worst.
10502629	10504670	I would say the bleached asshole thing went way too far.
10506161	10512486	SSJ100 Matt wants to know, besides Kid Icarus, what characters would you like to see in the next Super Smash Bros. ?
10537432	10538052	Samus vs. The Guardian
10566742	10573706	Even though it wasn't purely Nintendo, because it was first on MSX, wouldn't that just be an awesome fight?
10574027	10575968	Because I think it would be a pretty dead-even match.
10576648	10579129	Except that I think the Guardian actually gets more weapons.
10579149	10580230	I want to see Nestor.
10582371	10583252	Howard and Nestor?
10584112	10586494	I would like to see on the next Super Smash Bros.
10586594	10588475	a Nintendog get in there.
10589415	10589815	Yeah!
10590476	10591336	Get a puppy in there.
10591396	10592057	Puppy battle!
10592317	10593257	And he poops on you.
10593618	10594158	Alright, I know...
10594878	10601003	Seriously, I know we have probably enough Fire Emblem characters in current Smash Bros.
10601043	10603505	Melee, but I would like to see Hector in there.
10604746	10608409	I would like to see at least someone representing an axe.
10608829	10609890	Okay, alright.
10610771	10612612	Alright, I think we've given you a lot of good ideas there.
10613433	10616896	Anyway, moving on, Sefi would like to know, and this is the
10617628	10622053	Perennial question that comes up once every 50 shows or so, so there's no problem we can't answer this again.
10622513	10625216	Where did you guys come up with the name Orange Lounge?
10625996	10629300	So, we get this question quite a bit, no biggie.
10629800	10630601	My fault.
10632183	10635386	Well, no, wait, we both came up with this when we were on the train there.
10636334	10641478	We knew we wanted to do a radio station that had to do with DDR and Bimani Games was kind of the root.
10641518	10644460	We started with our love of music-based video games.
10644800	10654747	The podcast was separate because we knew we wanted to grow eventually outside the mold of music-based games and talk about other video games because we're gamers first and music game fans second.
10655167	10661391	But we knew when we first started this whole thing in 2001, we wanted to do something dedicated to specifically the music video games.
10661992	10665594	And Orange Lounge is a band that does some of the music for these games.
10666755	10667775	That's Orange Lounge right there.
10671578	10675580	And Orange Lounge just sounded like a good radio show name.
10675620	10678742	Because like a lounge, like we're lounging around and talking about games.
10678942	10685867	Because the feel of the show is very much the feel I think that we're trying to emulate from the show I used to be a part of, which is Under Sedation Live.
10686387	10689929	Where it was just a bunch of us and it sounded like we were sitting around at Denny's talking about nothing.
10690349	10691410	I visited there a lot.
10692236	10695137	I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Iguana Girl once.
10695197	10696898	DarkSakura was a frequent guest over on our station live.
10697118	10700300	So we're just trying to create that Denny's talking about whatever vibe.
10700700	10702301	So that's us, Orange Lounge.
10705817	10706577	We've got to hurry up here.
10706617	10707618	We've got a bunch of questions still.
10708938	10710159	Lots of questions here.
10710259	10715000	I'm going to ask just one of them from NM64.
10715901	10719342	What's going to be the first game you'll download for the Nintendo Revolution?
10719642	10722043	One NES, SNES, and Nintendo 64.
10722123	10724704	If it could be any?
10725184	10725344	Any.
10726585	10728045	Actually, Nintendo's catalog.
10728245	10729206	Let's say Nintendo's catalog.
10729226	10730286	Fuck, no Guardian Legend.
10731226	10732107	Because that would really be it.
10732367	10732727	Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
10734555	10735916	Um, Nintendo.
10738038	10738459	I'll start.
10738599	10739039	I know mine.
10739159	10740881	Kid Icarus, duh.
10741201	10743123	Super Mario Kart or Super Metroid.
10743323	10743923	It's a tough call.
10744244	10744704	One of the two.
10745265	10748067	And 64, Mario 64.
10748928	10752431	Okay, mine would be... No, Pokemon Snap.
10757065	10759327	I would probably have to say Kid Icarus.
10760748	10767634	And then either Star Fox or Zelda A Link to the Past, probably Zelda.
10769415	10771857	And then 64, it would be Ocarina.
10773939	10774199	Loki?
10776881	10781425	I would have to say, I guess, Super Mario Bros., I guess.
10781645	10784307	And then I would have to do...
10786984	10793267	Oh, Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, and then Star Fox 64.
10793328	10794688	Ooh, good call.
10794868	10795289	That was fun.
10797310	10800091	Because Mario 64, I'm tired of it after the DS.
10800531	10802472	Too bad we never got Robotech Crystal Dreams.
10803353	10804093	We gotta hurry, we gotta hurry.
10804133	10805574	More questions here, we gotta get through, we're running over.
10806150	10808692	Rene would like to know, I've got a Beatmania noob question.
10808772	10813855	I'm anticipating the US version, and I'm wondering how far the game makes you go to make the music.
10814235	10817137	Are we going to have to key in every aspect of the song that's being played?
10819858	10822160	On the anothers, pretty much yes.
10822620	10829784	But on the easy ones, and when you get into beginner modes, like hitting one button will do the whole range.
10829844	10831946	Whereas in 7 key mode, you would actually have to hit...
10835472	10838873	It dumbs down the key notes, obviously, when you go into easy mode.
10839433	10853397	And in fact, a lot of times in easy mode, if you just watch what happens, go into easy mode and just start the song and don't press anything at all, you'll actually hear that quite a bit of the backbeat is already presented and you're usually just playing along to a melody or something.
10853417	10857318	And usually seven keys just kind of adds in a backbeat or light seven, I don't know.
10857699	10858739	They get progressively harder.
10858839	10862920	It's not till the anothers where you're pretty much really having to play every beat.
10863340	10864601	So, don't get scared off.
10865341	10869043	Especially, you know the American one is going to have a very accessible beginner mode.
10869443	10871584	Light 7, 7 key, another progression.
10871684	10873425	Assuming that another's make it to America.
10873785	10874825	But I don't see why they wouldn't.
10874845	10876506	It would be really stupid of Konami not to do it.
10877146	10880087	He also would like to note, Rini would like to say, Popcoon porn is hooray.
10880328	10881328	You just want to push their buttons.
10882428	10882749	Right.
10884049	10886430	Lastly, last question from Goggle.
10886450	10887291	This is a good one to end in.
10887311	10889592	And sorry to those of you guys whose questions we didn't get to tonight.
10889932	10892633	Goggle would like to know, why do I have to take economics?
10894349	10898974	DarkSakura, you are a motivational person here that motivates us to learn and get education.
10898994	10899574	Economics?
10899695	10900776	Yeah, why do you have to take economics?
10900976	10905561	Because colleges are fucking retarded to make us take all these classes we don't need to have nothing to do with our majors.
10906842	10911086	What is world geography going to do me in an art major?
10912628	10912948	Thank you.
10912968	10913829	I mean economics.
10915267	10917609	That was a very nice motivational speech there.
10917629	10918429	I appreciate that.
10918509	10923732	You take it because they make you, then you use your economic skills to make their bank accounts suffer.
10923893	10925033	So you can balance your checkbook?
10925133	10925514	I don't know.
10926334	10930597	No, that's not even what it's... I know, I know.
10930617	10936621	I'm going to make my friend who was a math major at UCSD take my math aptitude test so that I don't have to take any of it.
10938522	10939142	All right, kids.
10939182	10940663	We're at the end of the show, boys and girls.
10940783	10944586	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Magus.
10945179	10946460	If we can get Magus' final thought here.
10949381	10949662	Food.
10950762	10950982	Angel.
10952643	10954264	I think Rob summed it up earlier.
10955025	10955265	Ow.
10955605	10955885	Bugged.
10956025	10957106	That's okay, I needed that.
10957286	10957606	Bugged.
10958126	10958447	Burnout 4.
10959707	10960028	Loki.
10962149	10964150	I need time for Final Fantasy XI.
10966111	10967612	My final thought is Milkshake.
10968292	10968913	DarkSakura.
10969753	10971094	Reject false monkey butlers.
10972318	10973318	The final word of the show.
10973478	10974579	One word to sum it all up.
10974639	10975539	See you kids next week.
10975579	10976539	Listen to our podcast.
10976579	10977239	Vote us a five.
10977259	10979140	Whore out Orange Lounge Radio to the masses.

10979680	10982081	And listen to the title of the volume.
10982121	10982801	Last word of the show.
10982881	10984261	Magus, one word to sum it all up.
10984962	10985342	Noobs.
10987002	10991864	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
10992684	10996825	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

11026678	11028000	The devil went to Jamaica.
11028080	11029762	He was looking to sell some weed.
11029862	11030844	He was doing fine.
11030884	11031865	They were standing in line.
11031905	11033247	It was excellent weed indeed.
11033728	11040497	When he came across this young man who was likewise peddling pot, and the devil slid down the beach to the kid and said, Boy, let me tell you what.
11041201	11044063	I guess you kind of figured I'm a reefer head, of course.
11044503	11047845	And after all this time, I guess that I'm a connoisseur of sorts.
11048285	11051367	Now, your stuff smells okay, but this could tranquilize a horse.
11051647	11055069	I'll bet a million in cash against your stash, because I think mine's better than yours.
11055570	11058752	The boy said, my name's Johnny, and you ain't smoked nothing yet.
11059272	11060933	One hit of this grass will kick your ass.
11060973	11062234	You've got yourself a bed.
11062894	11076833	Johnny, roll a ball of hash and make sure it's the bomb Cause the devil's got the kind of stuff they smoked in Vietnam You'll get a million smackaroos in cash if you can cope But if you can't, the devil'll get your dope
11084528	11091072	The devil packed a bong with a little Acapulco gold and resin flew from his fingertips as he fired up his bowl.
11091552	11094634	He filled that chamber all the way and he took a mighty hit.
11095255	11098416	As they passed it back and forth, it gave them both a coughing fit.
11098737	11098897	Damn!
11113081	11119988	When the bowl was finished, Johnny said, hey man, that stuff was great, but fill your lungs with some of this and prepare to vegetate.
11120508	11122510	Cannabis, sativa, sweet Mary Jane.
11124112	11126074	The devil's in the backyard frying his brain.
11127815	11129617	Zigzag filled with a diggity dank.
11131459	11133261	Hold on tight, it'll hit you like a tank.
11138283	11164752	The devil nodded off because he knew that he was stoned And he asked if he could buy an ounce of the stuff that Johnny owned Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to catch a buzz I done told you once, you son of a bitch, mine's the best there ever was And they fired up doobies one by one Ain't it gonna stop till the bag is done Green as a bullfrog's sticky-ass glue Granny, do you get high?
11164812	11165652	Yes, I do
11174344	11177886	Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
