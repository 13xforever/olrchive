00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,400
Now we can get into what have you been playing this week, your gaming week,

27
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:12,480
what's going on in your gaming world, Dark Sakura? Well, while my husband's

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,800
been out of town at the GameStop Manager Conference in Texas, I've

29
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,560
I've been trying to entertain myself as best as I can.

30
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,160
Lots of Nintendogs, been playing lots of World of Warcraft,

31
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,900
which is excellent, and actually hopping over on the name

32
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,920
and playing Puyo Puyo, Blazing Star, Pole Star,

33
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,960
Metal Slug 5, Kix, I love Kix.

34
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,760
I love Kix, I wish they would have done

35
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,240
a newer version of that.

36
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,740
I mean, I know it's a simple game, but Kix is just awesome.

37
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:45,200
And at some point, I'm actually gonna be

38
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,800
hooking up our PC Engine Core Graphics to play more Legend, uh, more Valkyrie Densetsu.

39
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,940
I want to come over sometime because I don't know anywhere else where I could play this

40
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:59,880
except your house, which is the Walkin' Talkin' Video Game Museum. I want to play Alien Crush.

41
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:04,200
I have it. I have this urge for some Turbo Graphics. I have Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.

42
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:07,000
You know, I want to play the Crush games, I want to play Splatterhouse, and I want to

43
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,080
play Bonk. So we need to have a Turbo Graphics night, and I know you would have it all day.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,000
You know what, we need to, if I need to get two more controllers, but we hook up the multitap

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,880
and it's all about four player Bomberman.

46
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:17,880
I'm down.

47
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,880
I have Bomberman 94.

48
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:19,880
Alright.

49
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,880
We got to do that.

50
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,880
Alright.

51
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,880
We can talk about that on a future podcast.

52
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:23,880
And Marathon Dracula X.

53
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:24,880
Alright.

54
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,880
Hold on.

55
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,880
Speaking of kicks, I have to ask Loki real quick.

56
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:34,480
Arcade Infinity in LA, which has a lot of import games, a lot of Japanese games.

57
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,640
I remember one time we went there, I think we took a random trip to LA like last Christmas

58
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:43,700
or something, and there was a game that you were playing nonstop that was very much like

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:48,140
kicks except it was a woman's dress and as you would trace the lines around the

60
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:52,460
woman's dress I guess it would fall off or whatever it was what was that game do

61
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:56,980
you remember I don't remember the 3d game was because there they had a 3d

62
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:00,340
game that was one of them that was playing but the other games that I play

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:04,780
I still play religiously on when it will when I have the damn PC for my main

64
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:11,540
cabinet gals panic of course of course miss world was the bastardization of

65
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:16,020
crap I mean but the other one the 3d one I don't remember what's called but that

66
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,700
was a lot of fun too that was a little different I actually played think all

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,980
the way through that twice when we were there the last time cool anything else

68
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:26,900
in your gaming world I'm actually heading down a copy of that show I

69
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,220
Nikki what's that interesting little shooter game that has like muscle men in

70
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:37,900
it okay like these fantasy looking care it's it's it's in the family of Parodius

71
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:43,620
as far as the type of game but it's what guys it's really weird it means super

72
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:53,340
big brother okay um the first in the series had these two sort of fantasy

73
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:56,700
looking characters and they would fly around and shoot things and and later on

74
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:03,660
they had these two just really it's hard to describe them but they were shiny

75
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:13,020
muscle men and speedos who would go around shooting stuff they even did a a

76
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:19,540
real life like how Mortal Kombat was wasn't the stop animation not not like

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,980
pit fighter yeah motion capture but not no not really motion capture because

78
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:27,500
they were yeah they were kind of like that where you take the pictures of

79
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,260
people in different poses and then you animate them and pit fighter is one of

80
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:34,580
least favorite arcade games of all time but they actually did and even the

81
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,060
enemies were even you know actors and everything it's kind of neat game okay

82
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:43,820
sounds crazy it's crazy and I've been hunted down I also need a copy of a

83
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,020
chatting proteus well I've got sexy proteus if any of our listeners can help

84
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:52,580
dark soccer out send us an email and hey if you want if you want to see me slap

85
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:57,380
down a thousand dollars on a video game find me a copy of rainbow cotton not

86
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,740
I got Rainbow Cotton, Panorama Cotton, that was out on the Sega...

87
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,140
I've heard you talk about this game before. What's so great about this game?

88
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:08,920
Okay, the Cotton series of games, we actually got one in the States on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

89
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:12,060
It's about a little witch who's addicted to this candy called Willow

90
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:16,500
that makes her puke. And it was a side-scrolling game,

91
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:21,500
but, and for anyone who has a Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton was the one on Dreamcast,

92
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,340
but this one is a behind-the-view one.

93
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:31,340
The really cool thing about it on the Genesis, first of all they only made something like 600 copies, so it was a very limited edition.

94
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:38,340
And it had really advanced scrolling techniques that you really at the time could only see on Super Nintendo.

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,340
Wow, alright.

96
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:48,340
Just as I say, it's the Gens emulator, it's the only one I know that will run it, but if you find the ROM of Panorama Cotton, give it a try.

97
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,340
Not Panorama, but yeah, Panorama Cotton.

98
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:55,020
Okay, I have to see this just for the the witch who's puking that sounds kind of weird

99
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,940
I almost cosplayed her one year. I actually I will bring over my my

100
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:05,060
Boot disk and my copy of a rainbow. I check it out. I'll check it out. All right, Loki

101
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,380
How's your taming week been I played burnout revenge again?

102
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:14,280
Yeah, I played every break every break because we've got a race of cars and blow up and crash and all that fun stuff

103
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,300
It's just a good, you know, I aggression release

104
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:19,860
Anyways, I got to play that

105
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:25,580
Other than that really not too much else. I intended to play a lot of games, but just didn't get around to it

106
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:31,540
I'm probably gonna be playing some more games this week. I'm definitely gonna try playing graffiti Kingdom

107
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:36,740
I want to try out RPG maker 3 because that looked really interesting when I saw the stuff for it

108
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,100
And I love the ones on the PC

109
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,960
Which they actually did release a US version of RPG maker XP an English one just came out and

110
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:47,780
So that's worth checking out if you like making your own games

111
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:52,340
games. But other than that, I really haven't gotten to play that much. You know I was disappointed?

112
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:55,660
I looked at Best Buy and said I was trying to pick up a copy of Midway Arcade Treasures

113
00:07:55,660 --> 00:08:02,420
3. Not to be found. Anywhere. Isn't that out this week? I don't think it's out just yet.

114
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:09,220
Oh that's right, it is coming out this week. Way to go! Actually, I went by the Agitech

115
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:15,980
booth at E3 and got CRPG Maker 3 in action. Oh, what'd you think? Pretty cool. It has

116
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,100
so much customization in it. It's crazy.

117
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:22,700
Cool. So yeah, I'd say that's gonna be a worthy purchase.

118
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,900
Still working on the RPG for us, still.

119
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:30,180
Alright. Never gonna finish it, but it'll... Orange Lounge the game.

120
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,860
Better than Sky's voice the game, wouldn't you think?

121
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,220
Yes, yes. That's an old ass live show joke. I have to bring it up.

122
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:41,180
I know, it's like two years old, that's alright. Did play some more Burnout Legends

123
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:45,960
and that game's still fun. Burnout, Burnout, Burnout, Burnout. I'm gonna play other things

124
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,380
and burnout this week, I promise.

125
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,300
You know what, actually my week wasn't much better because I pretty much played games

126
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,040
I've already talked about on the show, so I don't have a whole lot else to add, sorry,

127
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,900
you know, the usual Final Fantasy XI.

128
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:04,800
A lot of Weheart Katamari, because I picked up that game this week, and I just been playing

129
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,800
the shit out of it.

130
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:11,080
I mean, honestly, if you liked the first game, I love some of the things they did with this

131
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,080
game.

132
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:17,040
I know on the three-hour show tonight you you expressed your difficulties you're having with we heart katamari

133
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,640
But I'm saving this I save this just for you

134
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:24,080
There's a stage in we heart katamari where you get to roll around a big ball of fire

135
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:25,800
It's like fire

136
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:31,900
It's a giant ball of fire and the goal is to take this fire and light a woodpile on fire and you roll over

137
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:37,000
Objects to make your ball bigger except it's the one stage where you can't roll over people for obvious reasons

138
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,400
Yeah

139
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:43,060
If you do hit people though, they catch on fire and they run away screaming and they'll jump into ponds and rivers and stuff

140
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,340
That is excellent. So does that redeem the game a little bit for you? It's not the game

141
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,020
I'm mad at I know I'm mad at everyone talking about it

142
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,840
Well, I had to it was a big part of my gaming weekend deal deal

143
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,140
I gotta mention one more thing what you know how you got moral combat shell and monks. Yes

144
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,780
Before it's supposed to come out

145
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:07,280
Was it really? Yeah, it wasn't supposed to Street until the 21st and midway

146
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,320
I got Midway in trouble and that was fun.

147
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:10,320
Really?

148
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,320
I snitched some of them.

149
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
You snitched?

150
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
What happened?

151
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,640
No, um, they don't know.

152
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,720
They don't know, but it was not, it was not supposed to be in stores until the 21st.

153
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
So...

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
Well lucky me I guess, huh?

155
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,840
So it was once again one of those things that I got at our purchasing department to call

156
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:27,800
them and Midway's like, what, I don't even know what happened.

157
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,720
So they got some explaining to do.

158
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,320
Hopefully some explaining will involve free games coming our way, but I doubt it.

159
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:40,880
Midway, I remember back when the show first started, Midway was one of the first gaming

160
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:47,160
companies to put us on their press list and stuff, so I hate to see Midway in trouble

161
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,560
because there's some nice people that work there.

162
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,360
It's just an error, it's a warehouse thing, you know, everyone makes mistakes.

163
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:00,140
Moving on, let's talk about some gaming news going on in the world right now.

164
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:02,800
We're going to start off with this, I think this is pretty big.

165
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:09,220
Dragon Quest VIII has a street date, Dragon Quest VIII will be coming out November 22nd.

166
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:13,440
What else is happening November 22nd?

167
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:17,500
This is coming from a gaming website here, they actually just, I don't know if they just

168
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,900
changed it or what?

169
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,700
Well if they just changed it, cool, otherwise it's December.

170
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,040
Well Dragon Quest VIII, they are saying, they sent out a press release saying that they

171
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,420
are putting it out in November on November 22nd because that's the same day that Xbox

172
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,420
360 launches.

173
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:36,260
Now here's the other thing that they're going to try and put a den in it with.

174
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:41,960
Dragon Quest VIII will come with a playable demo, Final Fantasy XII.

175
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:42,960
So that's...

176
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,960
Cha-ching!

177
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:44,960
Exactly.

178
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:45,960
I think that's the change.

179
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:48,240
I think that's what happened is now they're putting in this demo of Final Fantasy XII

180
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,720
to try and take a little bit, even though the Xbox 360 is going to be huge, a little

181
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,320
bit of attention away from that.

182
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:58,320
The only gripe I have about this game is it's done by the same artist that does Dragon Ball

183
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,160
Z, and I hate Dragon Ball Z.

184
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,020
I hate it to death and it just looks like Dragon Ball Z the game again

185
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:07,560
but I'm sick enough that I will buy this just for the demo. Here's the thing though

186
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:10,080
there's nothing coming out really the week of the 22nd

187
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,320
there is about 500 titles coming out in the week of

188
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:17,560
the 15th which is annoying as hell for people you know that are preparing

189
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,600
because all the 360 launch games are coming out that day

190
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,720
or the week before which is nice because I get mine shipped early but

191
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,680
I understand though because they all want to cash in on the day after

192
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,840
Thanksgiving I mean you have to you have to have your games out by then or they're

193
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,640
not they're not gonna be a part of the Christmas season you know unless you

194
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:39,040
release them but every day you lose between November 26th or I don't know I

195
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,920
don't have a calendar for a lot of good games coming out that that day King Kong

196
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:49,880
the 50 cent game you know stuff like that all right cool um let's move on I

197
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:52,920
want to talk about contests we're gonna give away some free stuff we already

198
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:57,640
gave away this tonight we're giving away one more and what we're giving away it's

199
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:03,640
It's a copy of the Dance Dance Revolution Extreme II V-Rare, and to sweeten the deal,

200
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:06,520
we're also giving away of the DDR Max II V-Rare.

201
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:12,300
Now, DDR Max II came out two years ago, but the V-Rare, you can't find it now.

202
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,540
So if you don't already have a copy of this V-Rare, this is one of the only ways you're

203
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,980
going to get it, short of eBay.

204
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,640
So we already gave one away on the live show tonight.

205
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:25,700
Congrats to FireBoma, who won the dual pack of V-Rares on tonight's show.

216
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,520
got it I guess I'm on the way all right here's the other one now this one you do

217
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:26,880
have to work for a little bit because this is a definitely something of value

218
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,920
this is a copy of in the groove it's a dance game for PlayStation 2 and dark

219
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,720
Sakura Loki and myself have all actually and I just dropped it on the ground we've

220
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:42,880
all already this is this is not a face it's not a sealed copy because we've all

221
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,000
autographed it among other things okay we put our own spin on this copy of in

222
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,000
the groove. Just look at the inside cover. Yes, we're giving it away to a lucky listener.

223
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:56,000
However, this one's a little more complicated. You have to show your poetic side. You must

224
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:04,200
send your best haiku about in the groove to this email address, haiku at orangelawnsradio.com.

225
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:09,760
For those of you guys that can't spell, that's H-A-I-K-U at orangelawnsradio.com. But there's

226
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,760
There's a twist!

227
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:11,760
Even better!

228
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,760
It's not a 5-7-5 haiku.

229
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,500
Jamie, what's the twist?

230
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,500
It's 5-7-3.

231
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,080
First line must be five syllables, second line seven, last line three.

232
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:24,240
The Orange Lounge Konami format.

233
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,660
And now, and if you get that joke, congratulations, you're a nerd, okay?

234
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,560
But it's a 5-7-3 haiku about In the Groove.

235
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,920
We will pick the favorite, read it on the podcast, read it on the air, and it's gonna

236
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:37,440
win this copy of In the Groove.

237
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:41,520
we might throw some other stuff in there too to sweeten the deal so maybe you got

238
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:49,360
one week deadline is Sunday night kids so get those in all right dark Sakura

239
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:57,040
you know what last week we had such a great show last week didn't we we were

240
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:03,920
we were really busy last week talking about all right we forgot dark

241
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,420
Sakura's advice column last week we were just on a roll with all the other stuff

242
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:11,560
so we're making it up to dark Sakura by letting her do her advice column early

243
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:13,960
on in the show tonight right after the giveaway when everybody's paying

244
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:18,440
attention and remember guys we do this because we can't talk about video games

245
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:22,760
all day long because if we if all we ever did is talk about video games all

246
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,440
day long we'd have no time to deface PlayStation 2 games and give them away

247
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:30,400
no although it is a completely working copy we didn't ruin the game so all

248
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:35,760
Alright, um, anyway, and for those of you guys that are getting a little angsty, fans

249
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,520
at home, by the way, you know, saying, why do you guys have to do that in the group?

250
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Because we can.

251
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
That's why we're giving it away.

252
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:42,520
Because we can.

253
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:43,520
We bought one.

254
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,520
We're just giving our honest opinion.

255
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,040
We bought one, wrote on it, and now we're giving it away because we can.

256
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:52,520
I personally didn't like the game, so I bought one, just so I could write, this game sucks

257
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,520
on it.

258
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,360
That's what I did, and we just went a little further from that.

259
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,000
But think of it this way, Loki supported in the group.

260
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,440
We did not get this free from the company.

261
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,400
They probably hate us for this, although they really shouldn't because we've said a lot

262
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:06,040
of nice things about Guitar Hero.

263
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:11,480
But you know, we bought this, we supported them, well, Loki bought it, Loki supported

264
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,360
them, and now we're giving it away because we can.

265
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,000
All right, sorry, anyway, sorry for that tangent.

266
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,760
Dark Sakura, it's your chance to speak to the world and let them know there's a whole

267
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,100
world out there outside their GameCube.

268
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:24,100
It's your advice, Collin.

269
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,200
What are you talking about tonight?

270
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:31,860
piece of advice is how to survive a hit and run number one if a car is headed

271
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:36,620
directly for you assess the amount of time you have like oh shit I got five

272
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:45,540
minutes oh shit I'm dead or two dive and roll out of the cars path if you have

273
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:49,220
enough time before impact you may get some cuts and bruises but you will not

274
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:55,360
get run over duh sorry three if you can't get out of the way jump as high as

275
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,800
you can before impact. Jump in a tight tuck or ball position with your arms over your

276
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:05,320
head. Jump in profile with your shoulder toward the car as this exposes fewer vital organs.

277
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,320
4. Brace for impact. You will probably hit the windshield.

278
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:15,600
5. Roll onto and off the windshield. 6. Stay rolled into a ball and brace yourself

279
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:18,800
for when you hit the ground. Keep your arms over your head.

280
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,560
7. Try to roll or crawl out of the way of any cars that might be approaching from either

281
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:33,640
direction but my last piece of advice yes use the fucking crosswalk all right

282
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,780
hmm I'm so sick of seeing people do that too but if you're playing Carmageddon

283
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:44,100
feel free to just run over everybody target all right hey I heard a rumor hmm

284
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:49,900
that I read online so it must be true what's that that there's a huge rumor

285
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,820
that news core is going to be buying NC soft really yet we know what NC soft

286
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:59,540
brought us didn't they bring us Guild Wars Guild Wars city of heroes lineage

287
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:05,220
city of villains it's it's funny funny that you bring up Guild Wars because I

288
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:10,140
was just about to get to the next story that Guild Wars actually sold 1 million

289
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,700
copies they are very happy about that so they're 1 millionth copy of the game

290
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:18,980
since the game launched in April and to celebrate Guild Wars special edition on

291
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:25,980
October 21st but the catch in Europe the special the special edition so this is

292
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,980
the chance for the Europe folks get this um before we do because we're not

293
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:33,300
getting it in North America until April so check that out

294
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:37,900
$49.99 for a copy of Guild Wars I've actually played this game what I really

295
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,300
like about Guild Wars I think it's a pretty game and I like the fact that I

296
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:44,900
can leave it for a few weeks and then just go back and it's not like I had

297
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:49,220
these fees that were accruing the whole time I didn't play.

298
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:52,580
Guild Wars has a really neat business model there, so I like Guild Wars.

299
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:55,100
I didn't get into Guild Wars.

300
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:56,940
I saw it, I didn't care for it.

301
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,480
But, you know, there are other special editions popping up on other things, aren't there?

302
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:03,980
Why don't you enlighten us?

303
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:06,420
Well, what about Nintendogs Special Edition?

304
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:09,580
Ah, yeah, okay, I just, I didn't know which one you were mentioning about.

305
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:10,580
Sure, you wanna talk about this?

306
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,580
You want me to talk about it?

307
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,580
Why don't you?

308
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,580
I certainly will.

309
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:18,020
special edition will be coming out just in time for the holiday season October

310
00:20:18,020 --> 00:20:23,740
24th is the date $149.99 is the price that will set you back wait a minute oh

311
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:29,740
yes it's not just the game it's a brand new DS as well so it's the DS is $149.99

312
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:35,980
good brand new colors of DS is by the way brand new colors it's pink and I

313
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:40,060
believe teal was the other color pink and teal comes with a brand new edition

314
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:45,140
of Nintendogs, it's the Best Friends Edition, which will have some of the more popular brands

315
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,900
from across the three games.

316
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,700
Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Beagle, Yorkshire Terrier, and Miniature

317
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,700
Dashund.

318
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:56,020
However, it's not limited to just those six.

319
00:20:56,020 --> 00:21:01,200
All 18, just like in the other games, you can unlock all 18 breeds, and secretly there

320
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,700
is a 19th we know of, the Dalmatian.

321
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,580
You can unlock these in the Best Friends game.

322
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,300
If you have the Fireman's Hat.

323
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,980
Just like you can unlock in the other games as well.

324
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:13,400
And I've seen the Dalmatian, it's cute, because my friend finally got a fireman's hat.

325
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,400
That's cool.

326
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,280
And you can actually unlock other stuff too if you play the game long enough, like I just

327
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:20,600
unlocked a new room by getting enough trainer points.

328
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
I actually unlocked the ranch style house.

329
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:23,800
Oh, okay, cool.

330
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,160
Of course I bought the tatami house instead, but...

331
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,160
Right.

332
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,520
I have some really ugly glasses and I got some stupid sleepy time record.

333
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,420
I have to admit I'm actually getting a little sick of Nintendogs, but I'm gonna try and

334
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,040
stick with it, because I just...

335
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,100
I like my puppies.

336
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:41,780
It's just the kill time until Animal Crossing DS comes out, which is in December.

337
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,780
I just wanted to state real quick, you also get with this package a bone-shaped screen

338
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:49,740
cleaner and a paw-print Nintendog skin for the system.

339
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,740
Aww.

340
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:58,540
I actually have a Nintendog skin for my DS, and it's adorable, and it's one of those removable

341
00:21:58,540 --> 00:21:59,540
kind.

342
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:05,240
Yeah, those, I'm trying to remember who puts them out, but these Nintendog skins, you can

343
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:10,920
can completely save them any time later and they actually add a bit more softness to holding

344
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:13,560
the system so that actually I can play for longer.

345
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:18,680
Oh, cool. Pretty cool. One other thing I want to share about Nintendo, and then we'll go

346
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:23,480
to somebody else for some news. Miyamoto actually made a rare public appearance in New York

347
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:29,600
City on this week. It was actually September 25th is when it happened, Sunday. We actually

348
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:34,000
had a listener on the three-hour program who called us, said that he was there and that

349
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:39,760
the line to meet Miyamoto was huge, huge, pretty tremendous. He said he saw signed power

350
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:43,760
gloves and everything. Why would so many people want to come meet Miyamoto and why is Miyamoto

351
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:48,360
showing up anyway? Well, Miyamoto was there to help promote Nintendogs at the Nintendo

352
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:57,040
World Store. Get this, the first 10 people in line got to do bark mode with Miyamoto.

353
00:22:57,040 --> 00:23:02,220
That's cool. How cool would that be to have Miyamoto's profile in your friends list on

354
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:05,580
on your DS, so we heard that, I think somebody had said,

355
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,840
I think he had said when he called in

356
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,060
that the first person in line was some guy

357
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,520
that flew in from Detroit and was there at like Saturday,

358
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,600
so this guy definitely earned it,

359
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,080
the bark mode with Miyamoto.

360
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,400
200 people were receiving an autograph from Miyamoto.

361
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:25,800
Very interesting, though.

362
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:28,040
I'm sure that a lot of DSs were there.

363
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,640
I saw people dressed up as Nintendo characters

364
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,920
in the pictures we saw, and I'm sure PictoChat galore,

365
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:35,820
and Intendog, Bark Mode galore,

366
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:37,980
probably everybody there unlocked all 18 dogs.

367
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:40,340
They're also passing out autographed skins.

368
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,180
Oh cool.

369
00:23:41,180 --> 00:23:42,540
But apparently they were in gold and silver,

370
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,180
which means that the ones that I got

371
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:47,500
with the Nintendo press kit at E3 was a different one.

372
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,260
So I thought that was pretty interesting

373
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,740
that they had those that they were giving out.

374
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:53,020
Apparently there were a lot of them.

375
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,360
Interesting.

376
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:55,660
Loki, what do you got for us tonight?

377
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,280
Something going on in the Hack and Crack world.

378
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,860
I know that there was big, big news

379
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:00,120
in the Hack and Crack world this week.

380
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:05,300
got to share this yeah of course those people out there trying to break the PSP

381
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:11,160
and they have they found a way to utilize the photo gallery to actually

382
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:15,380
kind of do a what they call a buffer overrun and allows you basically to

383
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:21,180
overload the memory of the PSP to run your own code in there and they've done

384
00:24:21,180 --> 00:24:27,240
everything from hello world to some sort of pong demo which is interesting but

385
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:31,600
But this is only the beginning, this is kind of a way to maybe possibly run homebrew stuff

386
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:35,740
on 2.0 PSP since the down grader is probably never going to come out.

387
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,240
So hey, it's something cool.

388
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,760
That was one of the cool things.

389
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:48,000
The other one that was worth mentioning is there's actually a guy who goes by the name

390
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:53,160
Raph and he's working on PSP radio which is actually a shoutcast program that you can

391
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,300
use to listen to shoutcast streams which is kind of cool.

392
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:59,960
So they've got that coming out and he's still working on that.

393
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:05,320
Now aside from the PSP, we've got some stuff on the DS.

394
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:11,360
The first thing is the Wi-Fi is almost done being hacked.

395
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:16,840
The guy that's working on it right now is trying to create an IRC program for it, which

396
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,840
would be really cool.

397
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,720
Okay, that would be cool.

398
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:25,680
So he's shooting for the prize, I think it was over $2,000 to do that.

399
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,920
And other than that, lots of DS stuff coming out in November here.

400
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:35,520
My favorite being Mario Kart DS, which is going to feature all the tracks from, or select

401
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,800
tracks from all the series.

402
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:41,400
Everything from the GameCube versions to the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo, Super Nintendo,

403
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,400
all that stuff.

404
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,400
Rainbow Road.

405
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
Yep.

406
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
That kind of stuff.

407
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:51,000
And then, on top of all that, the one I wanted to mention was about the Game Boy Micro, and

408
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,280
this is kind of interesting.

409
00:25:53,280 --> 00:25:58,960
notice that when you take the cover off the Game Boy Micro, because they have those interchangeable

410
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:04,520
covers, the faceplates, that there's actually a port that's a 5 volt power port for it,

411
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:08,880
and what they're speculating is, later on you're going to get faceplates that blink

412
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,760
or do weird things or light up or all sorts of weird things.

413
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:16,320
So you can have your Game Boy Micro just blinged out.

414
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,320
Blinged out, yes.

415
00:26:17,320 --> 00:26:21,960
And they can look just as god-awful as those cell phones that look like a 24 hour bar when

416
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:22,960
they ring.

417
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,160
crazy pretty much so that yeah that was something worth mentioning and looks

418
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,240
interesting I can't wait to see what they do with that very cool I found

419
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:34,680
something interesting about the micro what's that the play on micro oh tell us

420
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:38,160
about that definitely and from what I can see on this they actually are doing

421
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:45,560
internet only orders the last update on the site was on the 13th unfortunately my

422
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:49,520
you know Japanese reading is not the very best but looks like they're taking

423
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:59,280
the orders on Amazon, JP, Tsutaya, Yodobashi, Toys R Us, Nintendo, Yamada Denki,

424
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,680
Softmap, some of those sites. But it looks like it's online order only for

425
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:10,000
those. And it is actually different than the play-on they had for the DS

426
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:20,600
and the SP this one is specifically built for the the micro specs on it mp3

427
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:31,280
MPEG one layer three you know the usual it says it can go up to 128 K hmm as far

428
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:38,840
as it also will do epic for video ASF wait but 128 K's oh no I see is the

429
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:43,640
I thought that was how much it would hold, and I'm like, you can't do video with that much?

430
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:44,440
Okay, got it.

431
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:49,040
But it's looking like it's gonna rely mostly on the MPEG4 format for video.

432
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:50,040
Cool.

433
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:58,040
Um, just trying to double check, because again, a lot of this isn't...

434
00:27:58,040 --> 00:28:02,040
Actually, it's saying that actually it can get up to 320, 320K.

435
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:06,440
Okay, cool. That's good, because I was gonna say, you know, a lot of MP3s, I know I code all mine in 160,

436
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,680
so if it capped at 128, that would kind of suck.

437
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,400
Again, I'm having to sort of wrap my mind around

438
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,040
some of these kanji that I'm not familiar with.

439
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:15,880
That's all right.

440
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,320
While you're doing that, let me read one other quick story

441
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:19,120
on the Micro while we're on that.

442
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,160
I wanted to mention this,

443
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:22,780
that the Micro actually came out this week in Japan.

444
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,720
Now, we're getting it this week, I believe,

445
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,280
the 26th or 27th is when we're getting it?

446
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:28,360
Probably 27th.

447
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:31,180
We're getting it this week, but Japan just got it,

448
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,900
and how well is it doing in Japan?

449
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:37,300
Well, it's being seen more as a collectible

450
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,340
than an actual system.

451
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:41,200
It's kind of selling as more of a collectible,

452
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,500
but that isn't stopping it from selling huge.

453
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,320
For the week of September 12th,

454
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,860
148,000 units of the Game Boy Micro were sold.

455
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:49,780
To put that in perspective,

456
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:52,620
when Game Boy Advance SP first came out,

457
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:56,440
110,000 units in February of 2003.

458
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,640
So this is actually outselling in the first week,

459
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,260
the Game Boy Advance SP.

460
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,560
So a lot of people eating up the micro.

461
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:11,000
so very interesting. Also, I believe Earthbound 1 and 2 is on its way to advance. I don't

462
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:15,080
know if that already came out or just came out, but I know I'm really excited about that

463
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,240
because I want to check out this game.

464
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,240
That would be cool.

465
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:21,100
I hope they put it out over here. Jamie, any other details on the player?

466
00:29:21,100 --> 00:29:29,720
I think it's going over something about media stage. That for anything that's 384 looks

467
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:37,040
like a K per second and 512 it streams at 30 frames per second but saying

468
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:42,940
something else about 256 at 15 frames per second so I'm not really getting too

469
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:46,640
much more out of that. Okay some video specs there. All right. Well Dark Sakura

491
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:47,500
little bit of UK news I've been trying to dig up something fun there's a

492
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:52,580
brighter SP coming out I actually heard about this that they're kind of just

493
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:57,380
promoting it as a brighter screen and Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer that the

494
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,180
backlit version of the Game Boy Advance SP is coming out to Europe in a graphite

495
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:08,700
and pearl blue the ones that were that we got they're actually coming out with

496
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,900
the new backlit screens in Europe too there's no date listed yet it'll be

497
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:17,560
about the same brightness as the micro actually they showed like a

498
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:21,060
side-by-side picture with the old one that those micros were they were

499
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:27,360
flashlights they were great. Another thing referenced that according to their

500
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:33,420
Nintendo spokesperson for UK actually stating now the technology has

501
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:37,880
come down in price enough for backlights to be affordable so basically people

502
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:43,440
aren't gonna have to pay any more for it it's just gonna be there. Very cool all

503
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:50,460
right I got a story here now on EB Games the retailer they're sold out of Xbox

504
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:55,460
360s and the darn thing hasn't even come out yet if you go to their online store

505
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:59,060
you're gonna get a message that says we are currently sold out of our popular

506
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:04,340
Xbox 360 bundles check back frequently for more opportunities to pre-order an

507
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:10,820
Xbox 360 I hear GameStop is also I believe I but they're still trying to

508
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,540
push their stupid $1,200 well yeah but maybe the website but they're still

509
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,740
taking pre-orders in the stores?

510
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,740
Even, yeah, for the generic, er, general, um, general, I can't talk tonight, general,

511
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:29,740
general, um, Xbox 360s, um, do both the basics and the super packer, I don't remember what

512
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:32,220
they're calling them, the 300 and the 400 one.

513
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,720
Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 core.

514
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:39,740
Thank you. Uh, you can still buy those. Or you can do what I do, and I like to rush the

515
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,020
store the day the game, the, it comes out. Rush Best Buyers, maybe doesn't do pre-orders.

516
00:32:44,020 --> 00:32:45,620
Mine's already paid for, all the way.

517
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:47,520
I'm gonna rush a store when it comes out.

518
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,900
I don't know which one yet, I have a store in mind

519
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:51,300
that not a lot of people go to, but.

520
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:55,460
This is why I bless my advantage of having a husband

521
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,300
that works for GameStop.

522
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,460
Well, for the rest of us.

523
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,620
And now that I'm married, I can take his pay stub

524
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,580
into Barnes and Noble and buy books.

525
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:02,980
I'm so happy.

526
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,800
All right.

527
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,820
Being married is awesome, by the way.

528
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:08,860
Because that means I get my video game cracked cheaper.

529
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,540
Random reminder just popped into my head,

530
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,620
congratulations to DDArcholic,

531
00:33:12,620 --> 00:33:14,840
who had a beautiful baby boy this week.

532
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,040
One of the guests that we have frequently

533
00:33:17,040 --> 00:33:18,880
on our three hour show on Sunday nights

534
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:23,080
at orangehonestradio.com, she had her baby named Donovan.

535
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:23,920
Baby boy.

536
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,420
Kiyoshi.

537
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,080
Donovan Kiyoshi.

538
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,080
Congratulations.

539
00:33:26,080 --> 00:33:27,760
All right.

540
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,200
Now, Xbox 360 related.

541
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,080
Loki, you found something hilarious Xbox 360 related

542
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,880
on eBay.

543
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,760
You're going to give it away free.

544
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,400
You're going to see it on eBay.

545
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,880
And this would be a controller for the Xbox 360

546
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:41,880
was sold on eBay.

547
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:45,200
They have one now that's for $91.

548
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:47,640
It was actually purchased and ended.

549
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:51,520
But there's actually another one up on eBay right now that's for sale and it's going in

550
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:54,520
the $160 range for price.

551
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:58,440
And you know, really people, I don't know why you're buying this because it's retarded.

552
00:33:58,440 --> 00:33:59,440
It's coming back out.

553
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,040
I mean, the system stuff is going to be sold, the accessories.

554
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,320
I can tell you this much, the quarter controller is like $30.

555
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,960
Do not spend $160 for a quarter controller.

556
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,280
it early will do you nothing except you can lick it like the girl did with the

557
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:16,640
PSP I was gonna do that if I won that but I would not bid on this for the life

558
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:23,160
of me no I mean maybe a system why your system is gonna come with one just wait

559
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:28,800
exactly it's just why why people why do you have to spend the money on this all

560
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,240
right I got another story that's Microsoft related of course last week's

561
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:36,080
show we were talking an awful lot about the Nintendo revolution well Microsoft

562
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:42,040
to surprisingly come out and kind of professionally congratulated Nintendo on this, well now don't

563
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:50,160
shake your head just yet Loki, actually Xbox VP of worldwide marketing and publishing Peter

564
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:55,440
Moore said quote, I want to give kudos for Nintendo for its attempt at innovation with

565
00:34:55,440 --> 00:35:02,480
the new controller, dot dot dot, bring people in that as Iwata-san said are either lapsed

566
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:06,640
gamers or gamers that are intimidated by the complexity of the controller so

567
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,400
they're kind of given a little pat on the back there but I hear now rumor is

568
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:14,480
the Microsoft is coming up with their own thing that's gonna kind of combat

569
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:18,560
the revolution so to speak rip it off you know the most innovative ever

570
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,520
controller was that one Atari controller that hooked up to your forehead that you

571
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,880
controlled by your eyebrows what I've never heard of that yep it was how about

572
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:31,880
it of course failed how about you want to talk about failure how about that in

573
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:35,780
television controller that had the nine button thing that looked like a telephone and then

574
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:38,780
that disk that never worked, ever?

575
00:35:38,780 --> 00:35:41,500
I had a Colecovision.

576
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:44,860
And that controller was the greatest thing ever for mousetrap.

577
00:35:44,860 --> 00:35:48,880
My best friend in elementary school had a Colecovision.

578
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,700
We mean the nine button thing with like the joystick.

579
00:35:51,700 --> 00:35:54,540
It had the disk and the little buttons that you would hit at the top.

580
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,540
We used to have one of those.

581
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,740
I think it was a piece of crap.

582
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,500
The number pad though, if you're playing on the ColecoVision, the number pad was excellent.

583
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,340
It was awesome that you slipped the little sheets in there to tell you which buttons

584
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,340
do what.

585
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,340
Like I said, mousetrap.

586
00:36:07,340 --> 00:36:08,340
It's all about mousetrap.

587
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:09,340
Good idea in theory, but it didn't work.

588
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,340
It did too work!

589
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:11,340
Not for me.

590
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:13,340
Well, for Coleco it might have, and television it did.

591
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:15,460
You know what I'm going to do when the revolution comes out?

592
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:20,420
I'm buying another controller and I'm going to mod a power glove to be the controller.

593
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,420
You're a dork.

594
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,420
It's so bad.

595
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:26,540
Let's go from old games to new games, I want to get this out there real quick.

596
00:36:26,540 --> 00:36:35,340
Grand Theft Auto is going to be getting a trilogy very soon for the Xbox.

597
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,060
I know Grand Theft Auto the trilogy will be coming out for the Xbox and it's GTA 3 Vice

598
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:46,460
City and San Andreas that shouldn't be any big surprise but get this Grand Theft Auto

599
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:50,980
San Andreas Special Edition will be coming out for the Playstation 2.

600
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:55,400
This would be the version that has the hot coffee taken out of it of course and some

601
00:36:55,400 --> 00:37:00,480
extra features as well. I don't know exactly what the special

602
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,560
is that's going to be there. No, what it is, the special edition is their stupid documentary

603
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:06,520
that they're filming about the lowrider.

604
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:10,400
I thought that was a separate thing. Nope, that's the special edition. It's bundled with it

605
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:15,240
and it's all DVD for it. Okay, I get it. But there's also the PSP version

606
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,480
they're going to release as well. That's why I had two separate stories for that.

607
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:20,480
Because they're going to be releasing a UMD of that as well. So if you don't want to buy

608
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:22,520
the special edition but you want the documentary,

609
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:27,920
Sunday driver is what it's called you can buy that on UMD I'm sure has nothing

610
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:33,160
to do with the game at all I'm sure it will be Oscar worthy dark soccer what

611
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:36,760
else have you got for us tonight the game that I have been highly

612
00:37:36,760 --> 00:37:43,280
anticipating myself is the Final Fantasy 7 Dirge of Cerberus because I have to

613
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:48,200
say I'm not I don't go Bishona species blah blah blah because I think that's

614
00:37:48,200 --> 00:37:54,800
kind of retarded, but I do have my fangirlism for Vincent, because I was like, so cool,

615
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,160
the whole dark brooding type.

616
00:37:57,160 --> 00:38:00,440
The one character I never unlocked my first time through Final Fantasy VII, go figure.

617
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:02,000
I totally missed him.

618
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,600
I never opened that damn safe.

619
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,400
Go in the door and talk to him in the coffin, and I got it right the first time, without

620
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,040
the manual, so it was meant to be.

621
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:16,500
Anyway, we have updates on Dirge of Cerberus, as far as the gameplay.

622
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:20,800
Now we've seen movie files where it shows it to be sort of a first person, however it's

623
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:25,440
actually behind the shoulder third person where you can switch to a first person view.

624
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,320
So that's kind of like Resident Evil 4 a little bit, it sounds like?

625
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:34,360
It actually, IGN, an article I read on IGN does refer to Resident Evil 4 in comparison

626
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:35,960
to the aiming mode.

627
00:38:35,960 --> 00:38:36,960
Okay.

628
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:43,160
However you switch between melee and three different types of guns.

629
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:46,980
So they're saying it's kind of a disjointed way to play the game, but then again it's

630
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:48,760
not complete.

631
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,320
Another thing right now is that, for anyone else who's been keeping up with it, the beta

632
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,840
was delayed from September 1st.

633
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,760
Well the beta is starting, which is what I think is excellent, focusing toward the Play

634
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,560
Online members who signed up to participate, so of course it's only in Japan, but it is

635
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:12,940
actually going into effect starting from the date of this something it actually

636
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:17,600
was going into effect on the 22nd so they are already in progress and it

637
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:23,240
shipped to beta testing kits to the play online members cool but it's it's

638
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:28,320
looking pretty I've also got a trailer it's I found the link to announce seems

639
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,820
pretty big I haven't watched it yet because I actually just found it tonight

640
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:35,940
night before the show but I'm gonna give that a watch and let's see what happens

641
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,980
speaking of trailers I have to interject this here real quick I don't know if

642
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,700
either of you guys saw it but I saw the trailer from Tokyo game show some guy

643
00:39:43,700 --> 00:39:49,740
filmed this on a camera for Gran Turismo 5 oh my gosh did that game look sexy I

644
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:54,940
mean just realistic to the tee I mean and I know we say that with every system

645
00:39:54,940 --> 00:39:58,740
that comes out oh the graphics are so realistic oh yeah but seriously guys

646
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:02,180
Seriously, this time. I've seen this. Seriously. Realistic.

647
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:06,180
Everything next-gen looks that way. Um, Project Gotham Racing,

648
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:10,700
I mean, it's awesome. Grand Turismo always pushes the boundaries with

649
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,660
graphics, like they always,

650
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:14,780
they always really just run away with it,

651
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:18,020
graphically wise, and this is no different. This really isn't. It's just,

652
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,500
it looks superb. Can you imagine now Loki, like, burnout looking like this on the

653
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,300
next-gen system?

654
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:25,460
It is coming out in March. Oh, it's gonna be so hot.

655
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:28,700
I've already got my eyes set on it.

656
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:32,940
It's a matter of time, we're going to have a lapse in burnout here with Project Gotham

657
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,820
Racing coming in, and then I'm actually trying to pick up three or four games at launch for

658
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:38,820
the 360.

659
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,820
Wow.

660
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:44,420
I'm eyeing up Gears of War, but still to be determined because they haven't announced

661
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:49,620
a date, or not a date, a price for it yet, which means it can move.

662
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:55,180
There's also Project Gotham Racing 3, and then some other one, probably like an RPG.

663
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:57,480
So, let's go back over to DarkSakura.

664
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:01,680
I would like to poke around in our mailbox.

665
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
Of course!

666
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:08,040
We can't forget the listeners who email us every week at our email address, togo, t-o-g-o

667
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,120
at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

668
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,960
DarkSakura reads and responds to you.

669
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,680
Some of them on air.

670
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,000
Who wrote us this week, DarkSakura?

671
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:19,400
I do want to give a nod toward a...

672
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:24,680
I got an email from a guy named Deacon Deekman, who I thought was pretty cool.

673
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:27,880
he's one of those guys on the forums from Australia right and he actually

674
00:41:27,880 --> 00:41:35,320
also you know informed about the some of the about trying to get the PSP 2.0

675
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:40,080
firmware and the security flaw about the photos and the DS so I thought that was

676
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,240
cool he's also keeping track of it he also made a brand new set of a mode

677
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:48,260
icons for our forums that are all I hate to say it Jamie but they're all

678
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:53,000
Katamari Damacy related but they're cute they're so cute so we're gonna get

679
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,840
awesome we're gonna put them up as soon as we figure out how I also got an email

680
00:41:56,840 --> 00:42:04,900
from Al who just says Ragnarok Pekos he'll please yay that would that just

681
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:10,580
amused me cuz I was like oh yeah it's someone who plays so that was that 5% I

682
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,720
was referencing last week when I said 5% of our listeners will understand the

683
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:20,900
Ragnarok jokes all right cute I also got an email from Q in Singapore I think

684
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,280
I'm spelling that right, I'm pronouncing it right.

685
00:42:23,280 --> 00:42:25,700
Just says that Does Orange Lounge Radio

686
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:26,760
wanted to know about the songs.

687
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,440
I actually emailed back stating, you know,

688
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,520
about Orange Lounge and Tawasuke

689
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:34,000
and where to get the BeatMania CDs.

690
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,640
There's that worldwide thing I was talking about.

691
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:37,800
Thanks for emailing us and letting us know

692
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:39,000
that we have listeners worldwide.

693
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,600
Now I got a good email from Mike D,

694
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:46,440
on, who's actually on 1UP.com.

695
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,000
Wrote a pretty interesting blog

696
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,320
about people reading user and licensing.

697
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,760
Apparently there's some funny stuff thrown in there.

698
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:58,360
Just to go ahead, it says people scammed

699
00:42:58,360 --> 00:43:00,080
into downloading spyware by sneaking it

700
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,380
into the licensing agreement.

701
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:03,240
And the thing is is that legally,

702
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:06,920
once you click that I agree, you are signing a contract.

703
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:10,240
And I even remember in my business law classes,

704
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,440
they even went into that where

705
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:14,200
that is a legally binding document.

706
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:16,320
This is a big thing with Kazaa, remember Kazaa?

707
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:19,800
they did this crap to you all the time that when you installed kazot would install the

708
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:26,620
stupid gorilla purple gorilla buddy guy yeah what was that thing uh fuck that guy i hated

709
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:31,920
that thing he uh posted a company can burn in hell he posted this link here uh well not

710
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:39,440
link but um a bit of the text from the uh uh licensing agreement sure for um i'm not

711
00:43:39,440 --> 00:43:43,480
sure what the program is well it may be later in here this software is not intended for

712
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,300
for use in the operation of nuclear facilities,

713
00:43:46,300 --> 00:43:49,120
aircraft navigation or communication systems,

714
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,520
air traffic control systems, life support machines

715
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,120
or other equipment in which the failure or the software

716
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:56,600
could lead to death, personal injury or severe physical

717
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,000
or environmental damage.

718
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:58,840
Duh.

719
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,920
That's part of the licensing agreement.

720
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:00,760
I think it's hilarious.

721
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:01,600
Like windows.

722
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,720
I mean, they could sneak in there, you know,

723
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,160
if you use this program and someone calls you a big weenie

724
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:09,440
for using it, don't blame us, you know.

725
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:12,560
But I think it's, you know, people really should stop

726
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:17,180
read those licensing agreements do we have a link to the article I do it's a

727
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:24,740
mini me 283 dot one up calm okay so some dudes blog on one up okay yeah but you

728
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:30,380
know major kudos to for poison I think that's a very interesting interesting

729
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:34,820
thing is I've even seen jokes snuck into licensing agreements where it didn't

730
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:38,980
affect the legality of the document one bit but it was I've seen them done with

731
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:44,720
humor cool but that's it actually is a very very very valid point you know

732
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:49,760
something also again we got one I just wanted you to make sure that we give our

733
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:55,160
nods to people from Danzig who listed about the DS Wi-Fi that Loki just

734
00:44:55,160 --> 00:45:00,400
touched on but I just like to you know thank our listeners keep sending him in

735
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:04,120
we go at orange on radio calm and we can't always read every email on the air

736
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:08,520
because we just get a lot of them but you know Jamie does read them all so I

737
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:15,080
I do, and I reply to almost all of them, although, honestly, I should, I'm at work, so, I mean,

738
00:45:15,080 --> 00:45:17,920
if I seem a little distracted sometimes in my reply, and...

739
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:21,960
Yeah, and let me reiterate that. When you send an email to togo at orangehonestreader.com,

740
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,400
Jamie does read them.

741
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:28,520
It is, yeah, and which I found incredibly hilarious for one of the other emails I received.

742
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,480
Yes, one of the ones we don't read on the air.

743
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:31,480
Yeah.

744
00:45:31,480 --> 00:45:33,220
We get it all.

745
00:45:33,220 --> 00:45:41,280
that we get and I almost always reply to it unless it's just something like, oh my god.

746
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,900
And then I'm just like, bleep, deleted.

747
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,460
Alright, well thank you guys who take out the time to email us and waste part of Jamie's

748
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:50,460
work day.

749
00:45:50,460 --> 00:45:51,460
We appreciate that.

750
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,780
No, waste it for a good cause, definitely.

751
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:54,540
Yeah, it definitely makes my day go faster.

752
00:45:54,540 --> 00:45:58,800

Just say, hi, I want to win.

761
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,600
Whatever you want to put.

762
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:15,360
We don't sell your email to anybody.

763
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:16,400
That's not cool.

764
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:17,800
No strings attached.

765
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:20,200
The other thing is the in the groove we're giving away.

766
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,200
Your haiku.

767
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:26,600
Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables, haiku at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

768
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:28,560
Just a couple stories left tonight.

769
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:35,420
Myst 5 is coming out, and they are calling this the final chapter in the PC adventure

770
00:46:35,420 --> 00:46:37,660
game saga coming out from Ubisoft.

771
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,360
I say, yeah right, as long as these games continue to sell, which I don't know how well

772
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,660
Myst 4 sold, but I don't think it was nearly as good as the first couple, there will always

773
00:46:46,660 --> 00:46:49,220
be Myst games or other types.

774
00:46:49,220 --> 00:46:56,340
$50 or $49.99 will be how much Myst 5 will set you back, and Myst 5 coming out end of

775
00:46:56,340 --> 00:47:01,020
of January is what they're looking at. Also a limited edition coming out that includes

776
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:08,440
a retrospective on DVD made by Turner Broadcasting. So kind of a well-produced documentary, I'm

777
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:13,520
sure it'll be. $60 if you want that version, Myst fans. You know, Myst was a pretty cool

778
00:47:13,520 --> 00:47:15,440
game. I think it's one of those series that maybe...

779
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:17,840
I actually have it on Saturn somewhere. I think it's one of those games that maybe

780
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:21,600
jumped the shark a little bit. And I was always... Didn't Myst come out around the same time

781
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:25,040
as The Seventh Guest? Remember that was very kind of similar in a way.

782
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,280
I remember another game that was out of that time that I liked, Phantasmagoria.

783
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,520
Oh, heck yeah, Phantasmagoria.

784
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:31,240
We need a new Phantasmagoria.

785
00:47:31,240 --> 00:47:34,800
I don't think, uh, Roberta Williams is associated with Sierra anymore.

786
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:37,800
I don't know, well anyway, Phantasmagoria, heck yeah.

787
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,200
Um, seventh guest, heck yeah, missed. Okay, sure, why not.

788
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,360
Actually, I liked Loom, but it's one of those weirdos.

789
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,960
That's a whole nother, not a whole nother one.

790
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:51,280
Alright, Loki, close us out tonight. What are the last stories you got for us tonight?

791
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,380
the first one is for some reason unbeknownst to me uh...

792
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:59,900
joanna dark from perfect dark zero is on the cover for him magazine

793
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,580
is this may be a response to the uh... playboy

794
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:05,460
which by the way silly pick up

795
00:48:05,460 --> 00:48:07,200
promise i will not

796
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:12,080
let you guys down i will pick up the magazine julie's earnings

797
00:48:12,080 --> 00:48:15,880
so yeah uh... that and then finally

798
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:19,520
you know we see all those mods that shrink stuff down make stuff portable

799
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,960
let's say we want to take something small and make it big. G4 did it with their Nintendo

800
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:31,760
controller but I think this guy one-upped them by making the Nintendo Game Man. And

801
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:39,560
the Game Man is actually a hundred pound version of the Game Boy. It's six and a half times

802
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,360
the scale of the Game Boy. Well the Game Boy's been out for like, what, fifteen years now

803
00:48:43,360 --> 00:48:47,300
so it's had plenty of time to go through puberty and all that so it's matured into a man now.

804
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:52,660
It's over three feet tall and weighs just over a hundred pounds and the cartridges

805
00:48:52,660 --> 00:48:56,300
He actually make cartridges for with Kirby's Dreamland Pokemon red

806
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,180
Super Mario Land and Tetris and they're all very playable and they're eight pound cartridges

807
00:49:02,180 --> 00:49:08,860
And you can actually plug it in and they've got pictures on his website of him actually playing the game. That's crazy

808
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:11,320
Where is this website? The website is at?

809
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:20,280
at gameman.loungespot.com and just go check it out and you've got a bunch of pictures

810
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:25,400
of how he made it and of actual gameplay and it was I guess an art type thing.

811
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,440
He did it for just like an art project.

812
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,040
DarkSoccer and I are sitting back here and we can't help but think of, now you're on

813
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:39,080
my own, my own my own man, anyway forget it, forget it.

814
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,080
Bad joke.

815
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:44,520
guys got that I hope you did but uh it should be noted though that the the page

816
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:48,440
here it says copyright 2002 so this is actually three years old so this is an

817
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:51,720
old thing how'd you just find this was it just on a blog lately or something or

818
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:56,600
yes okay I get it all right well that's what are they gonna make now the game

819
00:49:56,600 --> 00:50:07,480
man SP maybe shush what geriatric game I don't know it it's just interesting so I

820
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:12,640
I would like to see them make a six-and-a-half scale DS.

821
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:13,280
That'd be cool.

822
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,560
Where you just have to rub your whole body on it

823
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:18,120
to get anything, but you have to wipe it with your hands.

824
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:21,480
I completely forgot one last thing I got to mention,

825
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,800
because this was just funny that I saw this.

826
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:26,840
For the DS, someone actually made a homebrew game

827
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:28,360
called Tickle Girl.

828
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:29,360
Oh, no.

829
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:33,160
And you got to see the box art that they made for it.

830
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,160
It was quite hilarious.

831
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:37,160
Is it what we think a game called Tickle Girl

832
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:43,700
the DS would be. It says Tickle Girl version 1.0 and it says basically it's a multimedia

833
00:50:43,700 --> 00:50:47,640
experience where you interact with a virtual vixen via the touch screen, tickle different

834
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:52,300
areas of your dream girl to watch her reaction, utilizes full motion video, sampled audio

835
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,180
and looping background music. You know we feel the magic xxxy had something similar

836
00:50:56,180 --> 00:50:58,880
to this though because there was modes where you could kind of touch the girl and if you

837
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:03,720
tried to touch her in a naughty place she'd jump back and get mad at you. Yeah. So somebody

838
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:07,040
just took this idea in one update. Well, they also mentioned that, you know, it's as if

839
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:13,440
you like to feel the magic, you'll love this. If you can run homebrew stuff on your DS,

840
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:20,480
you can download it at ndsupdates.com, so check it out. Very cool. Wow, alright. That's

841
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:26,400
the end of the show, guys. Final thoughts. My final thought is I have to go grocery shopping

842
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:32,080
and there's no better time to go grocery shopping than, you know, one in the morning on a weekend.

843
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:37,000
times. Loki, I need to buy something I'm not sure what it is but I have this urge

844
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:40,640
to buy something and so I'm thinking it's gonna be something game related. Buy

845
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:49,080
me a car. No. Dark Sakura. Reject sexism in video games. All right that's gonna do

846
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:52,880
