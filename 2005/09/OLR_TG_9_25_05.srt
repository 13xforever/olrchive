00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:29,049
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

6
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:53,906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what up?

7
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:54,567
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

8
00:00:55,448 --> 00:00:57,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing remarkably well tonight.

9
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:57,972
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good to hear.

10
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,114
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how you doing?

11
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:00,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Tech Master Loki's here too.

12
00:01:00,957 --> 00:01:01,398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

13
00:01:02,082 --> 00:01:02,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

14
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:02,863
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

15
00:01:03,343 --> 00:01:04,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get started.

16
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:07,946
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do... Actually, no, I do have one announcement because this is major.

17
00:01:07,966 --> 00:01:08,647
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two announcements.

18
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:10,028
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep thinking of new announcements.

19
00:01:10,568 --> 00:01:14,531
[SPEAKER_02]: One, definitely check out our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

20
00:01:14,971 --> 00:01:18,774
[SPEAKER_02]: On the website, Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief.

21
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:20,175
[SPEAKER_02]: That drive is still going.

22
00:01:20,235 --> 00:01:20,735
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

23
00:01:20,775 --> 00:01:26,799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's us, Dark Records, and Club 21, some businesses in Sacramento where this show is based.

24
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,623
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're doing a worldwide effort because our podcast reaches worldwide to help raise...

25
00:01:32,404 --> 00:01:39,335
[SPEAKER_02]: Awareness, really, and funds and donations for not only the human survivors of Hurricane Katrina, but animals as well.

26
00:01:39,816 --> 00:01:41,378
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a very important...

27
00:01:42,679 --> 00:01:43,039
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

28
00:02:11,468 --> 00:02:19,031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while my husband's been out of town at the GameStop Manager Conference in Texas, I've been trying to entertain myself as best as I can.

29
00:02:19,631 --> 00:02:20,511
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Nintendogs.

30
00:02:21,472 --> 00:02:23,992
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft, which is excellent.

31
00:02:25,633 --> 00:02:32,975
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually hopping over on the MAME and playing Puyo Puyo, Blazing Star, Polestar, Metal Slug 5, Kix...

32
00:02:35,216 --> 00:02:37,218
[SPEAKER_02]: PC Engine Core Graphics to play more Valkyrie Densetsu

33
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:57,702
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to come over sometime because I don't know anywhere else where I could play this except your house, which is the Walking Talking Video Game Museum.

34
00:02:58,122 --> 00:02:59,303
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Alien Crush.

35
00:02:59,943 --> 00:03:00,323
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

36
00:03:00,543 --> 00:03:02,644
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this urge for some TurboGrafx.

37
00:03:02,664 --> 00:03:04,264
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.

38
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:07,646
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to play the Crush games, I want to play Splatterhouse, and I want to play Bonk.

39
00:03:07,746 --> 00:03:09,887
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have a TurboGrafx night, and I know you would have it all.

40
00:03:09,907 --> 00:03:15,529
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, we need to, I need to get two more controllers, but we hook up the multi-tap and it's all about four-player Bomberman.

41
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:17,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.

42
00:03:17,792 --> 00:03:18,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Batman 94.

43
00:03:19,417 --> 00:03:20,540
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to do that.

44
00:03:20,641 --> 00:03:21,864
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that on a future podcast.

45
00:03:21,884 --> 00:03:23,228
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Marathon Dracula X.

46
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:27,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of kicks, I have to ask Loki real quick.

47
00:03:28,858 --> 00:03:36,401
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade Infinity in L.A., which has a lot of import games, a lot of Japanese games, I remember one time we went there.

48
00:03:36,521 --> 00:03:38,262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we took a random trip to L.A.

49
00:03:38,662 --> 00:03:45,986
[SPEAKER_02]: like last Christmas or something, and there was a game that you were playing nonstop that was very much like kicks, except it was a woman's dress.

50
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:51,568
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you would trace the lines around the woman's dress, I guess it would fall off or whatever it was.

51
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:52,389
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that game?

52
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:53,309
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember anything about this?

53
00:03:53,509 --> 00:03:55,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what the 3D game was.

54
00:03:55,866 --> 00:03:57,327
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had a 3D game.

55
00:03:57,387 --> 00:03:58,707
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of them that I was playing.

56
00:03:58,727 --> 00:04:06,570
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other games that I play, I still play religiously on, well, when I have the damn PC for my main cabinet, Gal's Panic.

57
00:04:07,571 --> 00:04:08,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course.

58
00:04:09,271 --> 00:04:11,532
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss World was a bastardization of 6.

59
00:04:11,572 --> 00:04:12,493
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crap.

60
00:04:13,213 --> 00:04:16,794
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other one, the 3D one, I don't remember what it's called, but that one was a lot of fun too.

61
00:04:16,814 --> 00:04:17,575
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little different.

62
00:04:18,155 --> 00:04:21,896
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played all the way through that twice when we were there the last time.

63
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:22,336
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

64
00:04:22,657 --> 00:04:23,597
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else in your gaming world?

65
00:04:25,036 --> 00:04:27,299
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually handing down a copy of Chowai Nikki.

66
00:04:28,099 --> 00:04:28,480
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

67
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:32,403
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting little shooter game that has, like, musclemen in it.

68
00:04:33,765 --> 00:04:34,045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

69
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:35,947
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, these fantasy-looking characters.

70
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:39,490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the family of Parodius, as far as the type of game.

71
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:40,751
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's what, guys?

72
00:04:41,672 --> 00:04:42,573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.

73
00:04:43,013 --> 00:04:44,114
[SPEAKER_03]: It means super big brother.

74
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:46,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

75
00:04:46,597 --> 00:04:46,677
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

76
00:04:49,924 --> 00:04:55,547
[SPEAKER_03]: The first in the series had these two sort of fantasy-looking characters, and they would fly around and shoot things.

77
00:04:55,627 --> 00:05:03,530
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, they had these two just really... It's hard to describe them, but they were shiny.

78
00:05:04,391 --> 00:05:07,372
[SPEAKER_03]: Musclemen and Speedos, who would go around shooting stuff.

79
00:05:08,092 --> 00:05:08,993
[SPEAKER_03]: They even did a...

80
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:16,502
[SPEAKER_03]: A real life, like how Mortal Kombat was.

81
00:05:17,303 --> 00:05:18,905
[SPEAKER_03]: The stop animation.

82
00:05:19,265 --> 00:05:20,286
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like Pit Fighter.

83
00:05:20,426 --> 00:05:21,327
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, motion capture.

84
00:05:21,367 --> 00:05:29,414
[SPEAKER_03]: But not really motion capture because they were kind of like Pit Fighter where you take the pictures of people in different poses and then you animate them.

85
00:05:29,514 --> 00:05:31,716
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit Fighter is one of my least favorite arcade games of all time.

86
00:05:32,436 --> 00:05:32,897
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

87
00:05:50,094 --> 00:05:56,278
[SPEAKER_03]: And hey, if you want to see me slap down $1,000 on a video game, find me a copy of Rainbow Cotton.

88
00:05:57,319 --> 00:05:58,640
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Rainbow Cotton, Panorama Cotton.

89
00:05:59,801 --> 00:06:02,082
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard you talk about this game before.

90
00:06:02,122 --> 00:06:03,043
[SPEAKER_02]: What's so great about this game?

91
00:06:04,433 --> 00:06:05,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the Cotton series of games.

92
00:06:05,734 --> 00:06:08,856
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually got one in the States on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

93
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:13,118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a little witch who's addicted to this candy called Willow that makes her puke.

94
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:17,020
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a side-scrolling game.

95
00:06:18,601 --> 00:06:23,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anyone who has a Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton was the one on Dreamcast, but this one is a behind-the-view one.

96
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: The really cool thing about it on the Genesis, first of all, they only made something like 600 copies, so it was very limited edition.

97
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:37,710
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had really advanced scrolling techniques that you really at the time could only see on Super Nintendo.

98
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:38,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

99
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:39,230
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

100
00:06:39,891 --> 00:06:48,293
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I say, it's the Gens emulator is the only one I know that will run it, but if you find the ROM of Panorama Cotton, give it a try.

101
00:06:48,713 --> 00:06:50,614
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Panorama, but, yeah, Panorama Cotton.

102
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:51,853
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, okay.

103
00:06:52,073 --> 00:06:54,215
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to see this just for the witch who's puking.

104
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:55,115
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of weird.

105
00:06:55,175 --> 00:06:56,296
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost cosplayed her one year.

106
00:06:56,516 --> 00:07:02,942
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I will bring over my boot disc and my copy of Rainbow Cod to show you.

107
00:07:02,982 --> 00:07:03,482
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check it out.

108
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:03,982
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check it out.

109
00:07:04,183 --> 00:07:04,423
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

110
00:07:04,843 --> 00:07:05,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how's your game week been?

111
00:07:06,444 --> 00:07:07,125
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Burnout.

112
00:07:07,706 --> 00:07:08,226
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge, yeah.

113
00:07:08,286 --> 00:07:08,626
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

114
00:07:09,027 --> 00:07:10,328
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I played every break.

115
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:11,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Every break.

116
00:07:11,228 --> 00:07:14,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've got to race the cars and blow up and crash and all that fun stuff.

117
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:14,973
[SPEAKER_01]: R.P.G.

118
00:07:14,993 --> 00:07:15,153
[SPEAKER_01]: Maker 3

119
00:07:43,117 --> 00:07:43,957
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

120
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:14,267
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what'd you think?

121
00:08:14,488 --> 00:08:14,868
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

122
00:08:15,028 --> 00:08:15,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

123
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:18,169
[SPEAKER_03]: It has so much customization in it.

124
00:08:18,229 --> 00:08:18,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

125
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:19,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

126
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:22,532
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'd say that's going to be a worthy purchase.

127
00:08:23,272 --> 00:08:24,933
[SPEAKER_01]: Still working on the RPG for us.

128
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:25,773
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.

129
00:08:26,094 --> 00:08:26,494
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

130
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:30,036
[SPEAKER_01]: Never going to finish it, but it'll... Orange Lounge the game.

131
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:31,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

132
00:08:31,897 --> 00:08:33,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than Sky's Voice the game, wouldn't you think?

133
00:08:33,818 --> 00:08:34,098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

134
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an old-ass live show joke.

135
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,300
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to bring it up.

136
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,620
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

137
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like two years old.

138
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:38,880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

139
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:41,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Did play some more Burnout Legends, and that game's still fun.

140
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,760
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout, Burnout, Burnout, Burnout.

141
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,601
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play other things than Burnout this week, I promise.

142
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:48,681
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

143
00:08:48,741 --> 00:08:53,902
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, my week wasn't much better because I pretty much played games I've already talked about on the show, so I don't have a whole lot else to add.

144
00:08:53,962 --> 00:08:54,282
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

145
00:08:55,003 --> 00:08:58,463
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the usual Final Fantasy XI.

146
00:08:58,823 --> 00:09:05,525
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of We Heart Katamari because I picked up that game this week and I've just been playing the shit out of it.

147
00:09:05,645 --> 00:09:11,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, if you liked the first game, I love some of the things they did with this game.

148
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:11,306
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

149
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:18,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I know on the three-hour show tonight you expressed your difficulties you're having with We Heart Katamari, but I'm saving this.

150
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:19,695
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved this just for you.

151
00:09:19,975 --> 00:09:24,240
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a stage in We Heart Katamari where you get to roll around a big ball of fire.

152
00:09:25,273 --> 00:09:25,953
[SPEAKER_02]: I like fire.

153
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:31,216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a giant ball of fire and the goal is to take this fire and light a wood pile on fire.

154
00:09:31,477 --> 00:09:33,358
[SPEAKER_02]: And you roll over objects to make your ball bigger.

155
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:37,020
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's the one stage where you can't roll over people for obvious reasons.

156
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,700
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn!

157
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:43,203
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do hit people though, they catch on fire and they run away screaming and they'll jump into ponds and rivers and stuff.

158
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:44,704
[SPEAKER_03]: That is excellent.

159
00:09:45,004 --> 00:09:47,286
[SPEAKER_02]: So, does that redeem the game a little bit for you?

160
00:09:47,766 --> 00:09:49,047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the game I'm mad at.

161
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:49,707
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

162
00:09:49,747 --> 00:09:51,028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mad at everyone talking about it.

163
00:09:51,781 --> 00:09:52,343
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to.

164
00:09:52,523 --> 00:09:54,346
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big part of my gaming weekend.

165
00:09:54,887 --> 00:09:55,268
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal.

166
00:09:55,709 --> 00:09:56,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Deal.

167
00:09:56,451 --> 00:09:57,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta mention one more thing.

168
00:09:57,573 --> 00:09:57,773
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

169
00:09:58,154 --> 00:09:59,957
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you got Mortal Kombat Shell and Monks?

170
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:00,198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

171
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,262
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it was supposed to come out.

172
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:03,745
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it really?

173
00:10:04,127 --> 00:10:09,251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't supposed to street until the 21st, and Midway... I got Midway in trouble, and that was fun.

174
00:10:09,471 --> 00:10:09,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

175
00:10:09,952 --> 00:10:10,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I snitched on them.

176
00:10:11,133 --> 00:10:11,953
[SPEAKER_02]: You snitched?

177
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:12,674
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

178
00:10:12,754 --> 00:10:14,195
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um, they don't know.

179
00:10:14,616 --> 00:10:17,718
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know, but it was not supposed to be in stores until the 21st.

180
00:10:17,758 --> 00:10:20,240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, lucky me, I guess.

181
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:27,586
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was once again one of those things that I got at our purchasing department to call them, and Midway's like, I don't even know what happened.

182
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:30,729
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they've got something explaining to do.

183
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:32,022
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

184
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:56,036
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII has a street date.

185
00:10:56,096 --> 00:10:59,198
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII will be coming out November 22nd.

186
00:10:59,218 --> 00:11:00,699
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, what else is happening November 22nd?

187
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:00,839
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

188
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:02,680
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from a gaming website here.

189
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they just changed it or what.

190
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,161
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they just changed it, cool.

191
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it's December.

192
00:11:21,816 --> 00:11:24,518
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII will come with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XII.

193
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,420
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's... Cha-ching!

194
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,421
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, I think that's the change.

195
00:11:45,501 --> 00:11:53,963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what happened is now they're putting in this demo of Final Fantasy XII to try and take a little bit, even though the Xbox 360 is going to be huge, a little bit of attention away from that.

196
00:11:54,283 --> 00:12:03,926
[SPEAKER_01]: The only gripe I have about this game is it's done by the same artist that does Dragon Ball Z and I hate Dragon Ball Z. I hate it to death and it just looks like Dragon Ball Z the game again.

197
00:12:05,046 --> 00:12:06,988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick enough that I will buy this just for the demo.

198
00:12:07,008 --> 00:12:07,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, though.

199
00:12:07,648 --> 00:12:10,009
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing coming out really the week of the 22nd.

200
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:17,914
[SPEAKER_01]: There is about 500 titles coming out in the week of the 15th, which is annoying as hell for people that are preparing.

201
00:12:18,034 --> 00:12:23,437
[SPEAKER_01]: All the 360 launch games are coming out that day, or the week before, which is nice because I get mine shipped early.

202
00:12:25,576 --> 00:12:28,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, though, because they all want to cash in on the day after Thanksgiving.

203
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to.

204
00:12:29,117 --> 00:12:34,179
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have your games out by then, or they're not going to be a part of the Christmas season, you know, unless you release them.

205
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:39,862
[SPEAKER_02]: But every day you lose between November 26th or, I don't know, I don't have a calendar for it.

206
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:41,823
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good games coming out that day.

207
00:12:42,443 --> 00:12:44,504
[SPEAKER_01]: King Kong, the 50 Cent game.

208
00:12:45,939 --> 00:12:46,239
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Max 2 VRare

209
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:12,003
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Max 2 came out two years ago, but the VRare, you can't find it now.

210
00:13:12,263 --> 00:13:16,608
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't already have a copy of this VRare, this is one of the only ways you're going to get it short of eBay.

211
00:13:16,948 --> 00:13:19,571
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already gave one away on the live show tonight.

212
00:13:19,611 --> 00:13:22,494
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats to Fireboma, who won the...

213
00:13:24,116 --> 00:13:25,037
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.

214
00:13:46,754 --> 00:13:47,275
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you call that?

215
00:13:48,195 --> 00:13:50,737
[SPEAKER_03]: Restrictions other than multiple entries.

216
00:13:51,057 --> 00:13:51,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple entries.

217
00:13:52,098 --> 00:13:54,620
[SPEAKER_02]: We will catch you and we will disqualify you completely.

218
00:13:55,280 --> 00:13:57,582
[SPEAKER_02]: One entry per person, please.

219
00:13:58,162 --> 00:14:00,343
[SPEAKER_02]: No strings attached to the contest.

220
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,244
[SPEAKER_02]: You just send us an email.

221
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:02,385
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to send us a...

222
00:14:03,739 --> 00:14:04,080
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

223
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,881
[SPEAKER_02]: No zombies apply.

224
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,302
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is send us an email.

225
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.

226
00:14:07,823 --> 00:14:08,824
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pick one and we'll give it away.

227
00:14:09,064 --> 00:14:10,505
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the last time we're going to be doing this.

228
00:14:10,565 --> 00:14:13,528
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be having some more kick-ass stuff coming your way.

229
00:14:13,568 --> 00:14:14,288
[SPEAKER_01]: More games and stuff.

230
00:14:14,388 --> 00:14:14,849
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

231
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:18,952
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to get the hook up, so we're going to give away more games throughout future podcasts.

232
00:14:19,012 --> 00:14:19,553
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.

233
00:14:20,208 --> 00:14:21,009
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some.

234
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:21,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a supply.

235
00:14:36,232 --> 00:14:37,393
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just dropped it on the ground.

236
00:14:37,653 --> 00:14:41,014
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all already defaced it.

237
00:14:41,074 --> 00:14:44,656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sealed copy because we've all autographed it among other things.

238
00:14:45,277 --> 00:14:47,418
[SPEAKER_02]: We put our own spin on this copy of In the Groove.

239
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at the inside cover.

240
00:14:48,718 --> 00:14:50,979
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving it away to a lucky listener.

241
00:14:51,039 --> 00:14:52,820
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this one's a little more complicated.

242
00:14:53,361 --> 00:14:55,182
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to show your poetic side.

243
00:14:55,542 --> 00:15:05,907
[SPEAKER_02]: You must send your best haiku about In the Groove to this email address haiku at orangelaunchradio.com For those of you guys that can't spell, that's H

244
00:15:06,287 --> 00:15:09,628
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

245
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,480
[SPEAKER_02]: We had such a great show last week, didn't we?

246
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:55,963
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

247
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:19,566
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, guys, we do this because we can't talk about video games all day long.

248
00:16:19,906 --> 00:16:26,515
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if all we ever did is talk about video games all day long, we'd have no time to deface PlayStation 2 games and give them away.

249
00:16:27,676 --> 00:16:29,018
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it is a completely working copy.

250
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:29,759
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't ruin the game.

251
00:16:32,737 --> 00:16:39,202
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you guys that are getting a little angsty, fans at home, by the way, saying, why do you guys have to do that to Indigree?

252
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:39,942
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can.

253
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:41,223
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're giving it away.

254
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:41,724
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can.

255
00:16:41,804 --> 00:16:47,748
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought one, wrote on it, and now we're giving it away because we can.

256
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:52,812
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally didn't like the game, so I bought one just so I could write, this game sucks on it.

257
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,334
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did, and we just went a little further from that.

258
00:16:55,354 --> 00:16:56,114
[SPEAKER_02]: But think of it this way.

259
00:16:56,374 --> 00:16:57,916
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki supported Indigree.

260
00:16:57,996 --> 00:16:59,737
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not get this free from the company.

261
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:01,034
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

262
00:17:25,953 --> 00:17:28,574
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's piece of advice is how to survive a hit and run.

263
00:17:30,074 --> 00:17:34,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, if a car is headed directly for you, assess the amount of time you have.

264
00:17:35,016 --> 00:17:37,036
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh shit, I got five minutes!

265
00:17:37,697 --> 00:17:38,937
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, oh shit, I'm dead!

266
00:17:39,177 --> 00:17:40,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, no!

267
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:41,858
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Muller.

268
00:17:42,478 --> 00:17:46,839
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, dive and roll out of the car's path if you have enough time before impact.

269
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:49,920
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get some cuts and bruises, but you will not get run over.

270
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:50,941
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh!

271
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:51,861
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

272
00:17:53,008 --> 00:17:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: 3.

273
00:17:53,628 --> 00:17:56,530
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't get out of the way, jump as high as you can before impact.

274
00:17:56,890 --> 00:18:00,112
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump in a tight tuck or ball position with your arms over your head.

275
00:18:00,752 --> 00:18:03,053
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump in profile with your shoulder toward the car.

276
00:18:03,113 --> 00:18:04,774
[SPEAKER_03]: This exposes fewer vital organs.

277
00:18:05,715 --> 00:18:04,774
4.

278
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:06,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Brace for impact.

279
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:08,676
[SPEAKER_03]: You will probably hit the windshield.

280
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:08,676
5.

281
00:18:10,357 --> 00:18:12,558
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll onto and off the windshield.

282
00:18:13,639 --> 00:18:12,558
6.

283
00:18:14,059 --> 00:18:16,480
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay rolled into a ball and brace yourself for when you hit the ground.

284
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your arms over your head. 7.

285
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:20,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I heard a rumor.

286
00:18:20,652 --> 00:18:20,712
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

287
00:18:44,932 --> 00:18:46,453
[SPEAKER_03]: That I read online, so it must be true.

288
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,053
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

289
00:18:47,633 --> 00:18:51,856
[SPEAKER_03]: That there's a huge rumor that News Corp is going to be buying NCSoft.

290
00:18:52,796 --> 00:18:53,237
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

291
00:18:53,677 --> 00:18:55,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, we know what NCSoft brought us.

292
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,399
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they bring us Guild Wars?

293
00:18:57,499 --> 00:19:01,361
[SPEAKER_03]: Guild Wars, City of Heroes, Lineage, City of Villains.

294
00:19:02,445 --> 00:19:10,813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you bring up Guild Wars because I was just about to get to the next story that Guild Wars actually sold 1 million copies.

295
00:19:10,933 --> 00:19:12,114
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very happy about that.

296
00:19:12,154 --> 00:19:15,177
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold their 1 millionth copy of the game since the game launched in April.

297
00:19:15,597 --> 00:19:20,101
[SPEAKER_02]: And to celebrate, Guild Wars Special Edition on October 21st.

298
00:19:20,202 --> 00:19:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: But the catch?

299
00:19:22,484 --> 00:19:22,864
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe.

300
00:19:24,161 --> 00:19:25,602
[SPEAKER_02]: The special edition.

301
00:19:25,642 --> 00:19:28,184
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a chance for the Europe folks to get this before we do.

302
00:19:28,485 --> 00:19:30,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're not getting it in North America until April.

303
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:34,289
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

304
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,711
[SPEAKER_02]: $49.99 for a copy of Guild Wars.

305
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:36,852
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually played this game.

306
00:19:37,452 --> 00:19:39,874
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really like about Guild Wars, I think it's a pretty game.

307
00:19:40,194 --> 00:19:44,098
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the fact that I can leave it for a few weeks and then just go back.

308
00:19:44,138 --> 00:19:47,861
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like I had these fees that were accruing the whole time I didn't play.

309
00:19:49,122 --> 00:19:50,883
[SPEAKER_02]: Guild Wars has a really neat business model there.

310
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:51,524
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like Guild Wars.

311
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:54,469
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get into Guild Wars.

312
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,413
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it, I didn't care for it.

313
00:19:56,994 --> 00:20:00,882
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other special editions popping up on other things, aren't there?

314
00:20:02,465 --> 00:20:03,587
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you enlighten us?

315
00:20:04,292 --> 00:20:06,413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about Nintendog Special Edition?

316
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:09,355
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, okay, I just, I didn't know which one you were mentioning about.

317
00:20:09,615 --> 00:20:10,556
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to talk about this?

318
00:20:10,596 --> 00:20:11,256
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to talk about it?

319
00:20:11,276 --> 00:20:11,776
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you?

320
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:12,917
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly will.

321
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:17,099
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendog Special Edition will be coming out just in time for the holiday season.

322
00:20:17,580 --> 00:20:18,880
[SPEAKER_02]: October 24th is the date.

323
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,681
[SPEAKER_02]: $149.99 is the price that it'll set you back.

324
00:20:20,701 --> 00:20:21,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

325
00:20:24,395 --> 00:20:27,817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, it's not just the game, it's a brand new DS as well.

326
00:20:27,857 --> 00:20:29,619
[SPEAKER_02]: So the DS is $149.99.

327
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:33,561
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new colors of DSs, by the way.

328
00:20:33,681 --> 00:20:34,402
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new colors.

329
00:20:34,482 --> 00:20:37,364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pink and I believe teal was the other color.

330
00:20:37,744 --> 00:20:38,565
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink and teal.

331
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:40,986
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes with a brand new edition of Nintendogs.

332
00:20:41,046 --> 00:20:46,390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Best Friends edition, which will have some of the more popular brands from across the three games.

333
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,295
[SPEAKER_02]: Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Beagle, Yorkshire Terrier, and Miniature Dachshund.

334
00:20:53,215 --> 00:20:55,477
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not limited to just those six.

335
00:20:55,957 --> 00:21:03,183
[SPEAKER_02]: All 18, just like in the other games, you can unlock all 18 breeds and secretly there's a 19th we know of, the Dalmatian.

336
00:21:03,684 --> 00:21:05,765
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock these in the Best Friends game.

337
00:21:05,805 --> 00:21:06,946
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the Fireman's Hat.

338
00:21:07,106 --> 00:21:09,208
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you can unlock in the other games as well.

339
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,349
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen the Dalmatian.

340
00:21:10,429 --> 00:21:12,911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute because my friend finally got a Fireman's Hat.

341
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:13,640
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

342
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,841
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually unlock other stuff, too, if you play the game long enough.

343
00:21:16,881 --> 00:21:20,102
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just unlocked a new room by getting enough trainer points.

344
00:21:20,682 --> 00:21:22,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually unlocked the ranch-style house.

345
00:21:23,203 --> 00:21:23,744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, cool.

346
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:26,825
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I bought the tatami house instead.

347
00:21:27,385 --> 00:21:27,545
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

348
00:21:27,705 --> 00:21:31,106
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really ugly glasses, and I got some stupid sleepy time records.

349
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:36,835
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I'm actually getting a little sick of Nintendogs, but I'm going to try and stick with it, because I just... I like my puppies.

350
00:21:36,975 --> 00:21:41,739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the kill time until Animal Crossing DS comes out, which is in December.

351
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:49,205
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to state real quick, you also get with this package a bone-shaped screen cleaner and a paw print Nintendog skin for the system.

352
00:21:50,266 --> 00:21:50,466
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

353
00:21:50,846 --> 00:21:55,189
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a Nintendog skin for my DS.

354
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

355
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:58,872
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's adorable, and it's one of those removable kind.

356
00:21:59,513 --> 00:21:59,633
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

357
00:22:00,154 --> 00:22:13,274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those, I'm trying to remember who puts them out, but these Nintendog skins, you can completely save them any time later, and they are, they actually add a bit more softness to holding the system, so that actually, I can play for longer.

358
00:22:13,996 --> 00:22:14,536
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

359
00:22:15,171 --> 00:22:16,813
[SPEAKER_02]: The Line to Meet Miyamoto was...

360
00:22:36,638 --> 00:22:36,998
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.

361
00:22:37,378 --> 00:22:37,678
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.

362
00:22:37,718 --> 00:22:38,479
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty tremendous.

363
00:22:38,639 --> 00:22:40,660
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he saw signed power gloves and everything.

364
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would so many people want to come meet Miyamoto, and why is Miyamoto showing up anyway?

365
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:49,163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Miyamoto was there to help promote Nintendogs at the Nintendo World Store.

366
00:22:49,943 --> 00:22:50,363
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this.

367
00:22:50,724 --> 00:22:56,246
[SPEAKER_02]: The first ten people in line got to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto.

368
00:22:56,846 --> 00:22:57,987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

369
00:22:58,587 --> 00:23:02,830
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool would that be to have Miyamoto's profile in your friends list on your DS?

370
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:12,095
[SPEAKER_02]: So we heard that, I think somebody had said, I think he had said when he called in that the first person in line was some guy that flew in from Detroit and was there at like Saturday.

371
00:23:12,515 --> 00:23:17,578
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy definitely earned it, the bark mode with Miyamoto.

372
00:23:17,878 --> 00:23:23,061
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 people were receiving an autograph from Miyamoto.

373
00:23:24,673 --> 00:23:25,453
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, though.

374
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:27,874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that a lot of DSs were there.

375
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:37,677
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw people dressed up as Nintendo characters in the pictures we saw, and I'm sure PictoChat galore, Nintendog, BarkMode galore, probably everybody there unlocked all 18 dogs.

376
00:23:37,897 --> 00:23:39,838
[SPEAKER_03]: They were also passing out autographed skins.

377
00:23:40,338 --> 00:23:40,818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

378
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:47,220
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently they were in gold and silver, which means that the ones that I got with the Nintendo press kit at E3 was a different one.

379
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:47,980
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

380
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was pretty interesting that they had those that they were giving out.

381
00:23:51,661 --> 00:23:52,542
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there were a lot of them.

382
00:23:53,022 --> 00:23:53,462
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

383
00:23:53,482 --> 00:23:53,962
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

384
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,590
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you got for us tonight?

385
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:57,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Something going on in the hack and crack world.

386
00:23:57,251 --> 00:24:00,032
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there was big, big news in the hack and crack world this week.

387
00:24:00,052 --> 00:24:00,772
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to share this.

388
00:24:00,832 --> 00:24:02,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.

389
00:24:02,953 --> 00:24:13,579
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people out there trying to break the PSP, they found a way to utilize the photo gallery to actually do what they call a buffer overrun.

390
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,440
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you basically to...

391
00:24:16,033 --> 00:24:20,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Overload the memory of the PSP to run your own code in there.

392
00:24:20,675 --> 00:24:26,418
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done everything from Hello World to some sort of Pong demo, which is interesting.

393
00:24:27,138 --> 00:24:28,439
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is only the beginning.

394
00:24:28,499 --> 00:24:35,622
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a way to maybe possibly run homebrew stuff on 2.0 PSP since the downgrader is probably never going to come out.

395
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:38,163
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, it's something cool.

396
00:24:39,084 --> 00:24:40,685
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the cool things.

397
00:24:40,725 --> 00:24:42,926
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that was worth mentioning is...

398
00:24:44,557 --> 00:24:55,726
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a guy who goes by the name Raph, and he's working on PSP Radio, which is actually a shoutcast program that you can use to listen to shoutcast streams, which is kind of cool.

399
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:59,049
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got that coming out, and he's still working on that.

400
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:05,254
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, aside from the PSP, we've got some stuff on the DS.

401
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:10,018
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing is the Wi-Fi is almost done being hacked.

402
00:25:10,898 --> 00:25:13,921
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the guy working on it right now is...

403
00:25:14,642 --> 00:25:17,804
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to create an IRC program for it, which would be really cool.

404
00:25:18,004 --> 00:25:19,585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that would be cool.

405
00:25:19,645 --> 00:25:21,947
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's shooting for the prize.

406
00:25:22,027 --> 00:25:24,528
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was over $2,000 to do that.

407
00:25:25,509 --> 00:25:30,592
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, lots of DS stuff coming out in November here.

408
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:37,237
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite being Mario Kart DS, which is going to feature all the tracks from, or select tracks from all the series.

409
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:41,940
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from the GameCube versions to the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, all that stuff.

410
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:42,620
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow Road.

411
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:44,201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that kind of stuff.

412
00:25:45,253 --> 00:26:13,148
[SPEAKER_01]: and then on top of all that the one I wanted to mention was about the Game Boy Micro and this is kind of interesting someone noticed that when you take the cover off the Game Boy Micro because they have those interchangeable covers the faceplates that there's actually a port that's a 5 volt power port for it and what they're speculating is later on you're going to get faceplates that blink or do weird things or light up or all sorts of weird things so you can have

413
00:26:13,541 --> 00:26:14,702
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Micro Game Boy Micro

414
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:39,663
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I can see on this, they actually are doing internet-only orders.

415
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,825
[SPEAKER_03]: The last update on the site was on the 13th.

416
00:26:44,647 --> 00:27:01,243
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, my Japanese reading is not the very best, but it looks like they're taking the orders on Amazon, JP, Tsutaya, Yodobashi, Toys R Us, Nintendo, Yamada Denki, Softmap, some of those sites.

417
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:04,925
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like it's online order only for those.

418
00:27:05,565 --> 00:27:11,648
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is actually different than the play-on they had for the DS and the SP.

419
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:14,790
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is specifically built for the Micro.

420
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:22,934
[SPEAKER_03]: Specs on it, MP3, MPEG, one layer three, you know, the usual.

421
00:27:24,775 --> 00:27:26,296
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it can go up to 128K.

422
00:27:26,696 --> 00:27:26,756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

423
00:27:30,979 --> 00:27:35,864
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as the... It also will do MPEG-4 video, ASF.

424
00:27:36,024 --> 00:27:37,345
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but 128Ks?

425
00:27:37,565 --> 00:27:39,547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, all I see is the band... Never mind.

426
00:27:39,747 --> 00:27:43,491
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was like how much it would hold, and I'm like... No, no, that's... You can't do video with that much.

427
00:27:43,671 --> 00:27:44,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, got it.

428
00:27:44,812 --> 00:27:48,816
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's looking like it's going to rely mostly on the MPEG-4 format for video.

429
00:27:48,836 --> 00:27:50,757
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

430
00:27:51,378 --> 00:27:55,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to double check, because, again, a lot of this is in...

431
00:27:58,203 --> 00:28:01,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's saying that it can get up to 320k.

432
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:02,627
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

433
00:28:02,687 --> 00:28:08,472
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, because I was going to say, a lot of MP3s, I know I code all mine in 160, so if it capped at 128, that would kind of suck.

434
00:28:10,634 --> 00:28:15,018
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm having to sort of wrap my mind around some of these kanji that I'm not familiar with.

435
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:15,579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

436
00:28:15,719 --> 00:28:18,542
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're doing that, let me read one other quick story on the micro while we're on that.

437
00:28:19,222 --> 00:28:22,765
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to mention this, that the micro actually came out this week in Japan.

438
00:28:22,825 --> 00:28:27,229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're getting it this week, I believe, the 26th or 27th is when we're getting it?

439
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:28,030
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the 27th.

440
00:28:28,470 --> 00:28:32,594
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it this week, but Japan just got it, and how well is it doing in Japan?

441
00:28:33,054 --> 00:28:38,339
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually kind of being seen more as a collectible than an actual system.

442
00:28:38,379 --> 00:28:43,303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of selling as more of a collectible, but that isn't stopping it from selling huge.

443
00:28:43,584 --> 00:28:44,625
[SPEAKER_02]: For the week of September 12th,

444
00:28:45,345 --> 00:28:45,886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

445
00:29:06,207 --> 00:29:10,771
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I believe Earthbound 1 and 2 is on its way to Advance.

446
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:16,196
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that already came out or just came out, but I know I'm really excited about that because I want to check out this game.

447
00:29:16,537 --> 00:29:16,877
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be cool.

448
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,309
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they put it out over here.

449
00:29:18,869 --> 00:29:20,850
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, any other details on the player?

450
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:43,595
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going over something about media stage that for anything that's 384 looks like K per second and 512 it streams at 30 frames per second but seeing something else about 256 at 15 frames per second so I'm not really getting too much more out of that.

451
00:29:43,886 --> 00:29:44,566
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you in Australia.

452
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:45,327
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us a plane ticket.

453
00:29:45,347 --> 00:29:47,107
[SPEAKER_02]: We love all our listeners worldwide.

454
00:29:47,167 --> 00:29:47,747
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be in Antarctica.

455
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,966
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys worldwide for checking us out.

456
00:30:15,026 --> 00:30:16,307
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the rain down in Africa?

457
00:30:38,499 --> 00:30:40,300
[SPEAKER_02]: Hush up and get to the news.

458
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,740
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bad 80s reference.

459
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:45,061
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little bit of UK news.

460
00:30:45,101 --> 00:30:46,661
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to dig up something fun.

461
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:48,642
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a brighter SP coming out.

462
00:30:50,362 --> 00:30:55,184
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually heard about this, that they're kind of just promoting it as a brighter screen.

463
00:30:55,204 --> 00:31:02,966
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer that the backlit version of the Game Boy Advance SP is coming out to Europe in graphite and pearl blue.

464
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:10,944
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that we got, they're actually coming out with the new backlit screens in Europe, too.

465
00:31:11,144 --> 00:31:13,467
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no date listed yet.

466
00:31:13,648 --> 00:31:16,952
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be about the same brightness as the micro, actually.

467
00:31:17,052 --> 00:31:19,596
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed a side-by-side picture with the old one and the new one.

468
00:31:19,676 --> 00:31:20,477
[SPEAKER_01]: Those micros were...

469
00:31:20,797 --> 00:31:21,358
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bright.

470
00:31:21,378 --> 00:31:21,778
[SPEAKER_01]: Flashlights.

471
00:31:21,898 --> 00:31:22,459
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great.

472
00:31:23,300 --> 00:31:39,419
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing referenced that according to the Nintendo spokesperson for UK actually stating now the technology has come down in price enough for backlights to be affordable so basically people aren't going to have to pay anymore for it.

473
00:31:39,559 --> 00:31:40,440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be there.

474
00:31:42,591 --> 00:31:42,931
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

475
00:31:43,391 --> 00:31:43,671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

476
00:31:44,972 --> 00:31:48,853
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a story here now on EB Games, the retailer.

477
00:31:49,333 --> 00:31:52,814
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sold out of Xbox 360s, and the darn thing hasn't even come out yet.

478
00:31:53,694 --> 00:32:00,656
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to their online store, you're going to get a message that says, We are currently sold out of our popular Xbox 360 bundles.

479
00:32:01,056 --> 00:32:05,257
[SPEAKER_02]: Check back frequently for more opportunities to pre-order an Xbox 360.

480
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,218
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear GameStop is also...

481
00:32:09,048 --> 00:32:10,190
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

482
00:32:24,048 --> 00:32:29,051
[SPEAKER_02]: General, Xbox 360s, both the Basics and the Super Pack.

483
00:32:29,131 --> 00:32:30,192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what they're calling them.

484
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,793
[SPEAKER_01]: The 300 and the 400 one.

485
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:34,335
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Core.

486
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:34,915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

487
00:32:35,976 --> 00:32:37,096
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still buy those.

488
00:32:37,457 --> 00:32:41,799
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do what I do, and I like to rush the store the day it comes out.

489
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:43,781
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush Best Buy or somebody that doesn't do pre-orders.

490
00:32:43,941 --> 00:32:45,442
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's already paid for all the way.

491
00:32:45,562 --> 00:32:47,423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to rush a store when it comes out.

492
00:32:47,503 --> 00:32:48,283
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one yet.

493
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:49,164
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a store in mind.

494
00:32:49,918 --> 00:32:49,958
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.

495
00:32:49,998 --> 00:32:50,298
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcaholic D.D.

496
00:32:50,318 --> 00:32:50,498
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcaholic

497
00:33:15,922 --> 00:33:16,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Donovan Kiyoshi

498
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:41,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would be a controller for the Xbox 360 was sold on eBay.

499
00:33:41,822 --> 00:33:43,483
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one now that's for $91.

500
00:33:43,623 --> 00:33:47,044
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually purchased and ended.

501
00:33:47,524 --> 00:33:54,047
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's actually another one up on eBay right now that's for sale and it's going in the $160 range for price.

502
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:58,008
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, really people, I don't know why you're buying this because it's retarded.

503
00:33:58,328 --> 00:33:59,309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming back out.

504
00:33:59,389 --> 00:34:01,670
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the system stuff is going to be sold, the accessories.

505
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,951
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you this much, the quarter controller is like $30.

506
00:34:05,256 --> 00:34:07,538
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not spend $160 for a corded controller.

507
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Having it early will do you nothing.

508
00:34:10,381 --> 00:34:12,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Except you can lick it, like the girl did with the PSP.

509
00:34:13,203 --> 00:34:17,107
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do that if I won that, but I would not bid on this for the life of me, no.

510
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:20,910
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe a system?

511
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:21,311
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

512
00:34:21,351 --> 00:34:22,612
[SPEAKER_03]: Your system's going to come with one.

513
00:34:22,632 --> 00:34:23,132
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

514
00:34:23,733 --> 00:34:24,213
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

515
00:34:24,313 --> 00:34:25,635
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, why?

516
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:26,355
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, people?

517
00:34:26,455 --> 00:34:27,877
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you have to spend the money on this?

518
00:34:28,769 --> 00:34:31,350
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I got another story that's Microsoft related.

519
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:34,950
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, last week's show we were talking an awful lot about the Nintendo revolution.

520
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:43,212
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Microsoft has surprisingly come out and kind of professionally congratulated Nintendo on this, well, now don't shake your head just yet, Loki.

521
00:34:44,793 --> 00:34:50,614
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Xbox VP of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing, Peter Moore,

522
00:34:51,114 --> 00:34:56,355
[SPEAKER_02]: said, quote, I want to give kudos for Nintendo for its attempt at innovation with the new controller.

523
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:58,436
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

524
00:34:58,676 --> 00:35:06,077
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring people in that, as Iwata-san said, are either lapsed gamers or gamers that are intimidated by the complexity of the controller.

525
00:35:06,577 --> 00:35:08,258
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of giving a little pat on the back there.

526
00:35:08,278 --> 00:35:13,019
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hear now rumor is that Microsoft is coming up with their own thing that's going to

527
00:35:13,692 --> 00:35:14,633
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a ColecoVision.

528
00:35:41,307 --> 00:35:44,213
[SPEAKER_02]: And the controller was the greatest thing ever for Mousetrap.

529
00:35:44,793 --> 00:35:48,216
[SPEAKER_02]: My best friend in elementary school had a Coleco.

530
00:35:48,797 --> 00:35:51,339
[SPEAKER_01]: We mean the 9-button thing with the joystick.

531
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,302
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the disc and the little buttons that you would hit at the top.

532
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:55,683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we used to have one of those.

533
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:57,004
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a piece of crap.

534
00:35:57,665 --> 00:36:01,968
[SPEAKER_03]: The number pad, though, if you're playing on the ColecoVision, the number pad was excellent.

535
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:06,152
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome that he slipped the little sheets in there to tell you which buttons to do what.

536
00:36:06,192 --> 00:36:07,073
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, mousetrap.

537
00:36:07,153 --> 00:36:07,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about mousetrap.

538
00:36:07,854 --> 00:36:09,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Good idea in theory, but it didn't work.

539
00:36:09,255 --> 00:36:09,956
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, too, work.

540
00:36:10,676 --> 00:36:10,956
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

541
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:41,990
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy will be coming out for the Xbox, and it's GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.

542
00:36:42,031 --> 00:36:43,831
[SPEAKER_02]: That shouldn't be any big surprise.

543
00:36:44,332 --> 00:36:49,935
[SPEAKER_02]: But get this, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Special Edition will be coming out for the PlayStation 2.

544
00:36:50,495 --> 00:36:54,157
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, this would be the version that has the hot coffee taken out of it, of course.

545
00:36:54,737 --> 00:36:56,779
[SPEAKER_02]: and some extra features as well.

546
00:36:58,161 --> 00:37:01,644
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know exactly what the special is that's going to be there.

547
00:37:01,664 --> 00:37:06,369
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what it is, the special edition is their stupid documentary that they're filming about the lowrider.

548
00:37:06,389 --> 00:37:07,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought that was a separate thing.

549
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,272
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, that's the special edition.

550
00:37:09,312 --> 00:37:12,675
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bundled with it and that's the DVD for it.

551
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:13,316
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I get it.

552
00:37:13,556 --> 00:37:16,119
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also the PSP version they're going to release as well.

553
00:37:16,139 --> 00:37:17,420
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I had two separate stories for that.

554
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,521
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what else have you got for us tonight

555
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:40,822
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that I have been highly anticipating myself is the Final Fantasy 7 Dirge of Cerberus.

556
00:37:41,743 --> 00:37:49,306
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have to say, I don't go, ooh, bishona, bishies, blah, blah, blah, because I think that's kind of retarded.

557
00:37:49,866 --> 00:37:54,628
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have my fangirlism for Vincent, because I was like, so cool.

558
00:37:54,768 --> 00:37:56,969
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole dark, brooding type.

559
00:37:57,129 --> 00:37:59,650
[SPEAKER_02]: The one character I never unlocked my first time through Final Fantasy 7.

560
00:37:59,730 --> 00:38:00,190
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

561
00:38:00,490 --> 00:38:01,170
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally missed him.

562
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:03,171
[SPEAKER_02]: I never opened that damn safe.

563
00:38:04,551 --> 00:38:07,352
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in the door and talk to him in the coffin, and I got it right the first time.

564
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:10,673
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the manual, so it meant to be.

565
00:38:11,253 --> 00:38:15,754
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we have updates on Dirge of Sebris as far as the gameplay.

566
00:38:16,455 --> 00:38:19,936
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we've seen movie files where it shows it to be sort of a first person.

567
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:25,057
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's actually behind the shoulder third person where you can switch to a first person view.

568
00:38:25,377 --> 00:38:27,758
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of like Resident Evil 4 a little bit?

569
00:38:28,198 --> 00:38:35,381
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, IGN, an article I read on IGN does refer to Resident Evil 4 in comparison to the aiming mode.

570
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:41,943
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you switch between melee and three different types of guns.

571
00:38:43,092 --> 00:38:47,756
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying it's kind of a disjointed way to play the game, but then again, it's not complete.

572
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,821
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing right now is that, for anyone else who's been keeping up with it, the beta was delayed from September 1st.

573
00:38:53,941 --> 00:39:02,608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the beta is starting, which is what I think is excellent, focusing toward the PlayOnline members who signed up to participate, so of course it's only in Japan.

574
00:39:04,889 --> 00:39:08,572
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is actually going into effect starting...

575
00:39:11,134 --> 00:39:16,417
[SPEAKER_03]: From the date of this, I'm seeing it actually was going into effect on the 22nd, so they are already in progress.

576
00:39:17,417 --> 00:39:20,819
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's shipped to beta testing kits to the PlayOnline members.

577
00:39:22,219 --> 00:39:22,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

578
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,261
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's looking pretty... I've also got a trailer.

579
00:39:27,102 --> 00:39:28,062
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the link to it now.

580
00:39:28,082 --> 00:39:28,863
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems pretty big.

581
00:39:28,903 --> 00:39:32,524
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched it yet, because I actually just found it tonight before the show.

582
00:39:33,485 --> 00:39:35,946
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to give that a watch and see what happens.

583
00:39:36,727 --> 00:39:38,929
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of trailers, I have to interject this here real quick.

584
00:39:39,610 --> 00:39:43,393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if either of you guys saw it, but I saw the trailer from Tokyo Game Show.

585
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:46,015
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guy filmed this on a camera for Gran Turismo 5.

586
00:39:47,774 --> 00:39:49,576
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, did that game look sexy.

587
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:55,381
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just realistic to the T. I mean, and I know we say that with every system that comes out.

588
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:56,622
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the graphics are so realistic.

589
00:39:56,642 --> 00:39:57,603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the graphics are so realistic.

590
00:39:57,844 --> 00:39:58,684
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, guys.

591
00:39:59,245 --> 00:40:00,546
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, this time.

592
00:40:00,586 --> 00:40:01,167
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

593
00:40:01,647 --> 00:40:02,168
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistic.

594
00:40:02,348 --> 00:40:03,929
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything next-gen looks that way.

595
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:06,532
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Gotham Racing, I mean...

596
00:40:07,461 --> 00:40:07,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

597
00:40:08,461 --> 00:40:11,563
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo always pushes the boundaries with graphics.

598
00:40:12,023 --> 00:40:15,584
[SPEAKER_02]: They always really just run away with it, graphically wise.

599
00:40:15,764 --> 00:40:16,945
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is no different.

600
00:40:17,025 --> 00:40:17,645
[SPEAKER_02]: This really isn't.

601
00:40:17,705 --> 00:40:18,926
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks superb.

602
00:40:19,206 --> 00:40:22,207
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine now, Loki, burnout looking like this on a next-gen system?

603
00:40:22,427 --> 00:40:24,148
[SPEAKER_01]: It is coming out in March.

604
00:40:24,348 --> 00:40:25,388
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to be so hot.

605
00:40:25,969 --> 00:40:28,049
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got my eyes set on it.

606
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of time.

607
00:40:29,390 --> 00:40:34,212
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a lapse in burnout here with Project Gotham Racing coming in.

608
00:40:35,156 --> 00:40:37,998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to pick up three or four games that launch for the 360.

609
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:39,039
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

610
00:40:39,539 --> 00:40:47,924
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eyeing up Gears of War, but still to be determined because they haven't announced a price for it yet, which means it can move.

611
00:40:49,525 --> 00:40:54,468
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Project Gotham Racing 3, and then some other one, probably like an RPG.

612
00:40:55,469 --> 00:40:56,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back over to Dark Sakura.

613
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,892
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to poke around in our...

614
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:01,385
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbox.

615
00:41:01,625 --> 00:41:09,748
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we can't forget the listeners who email us every week at our email address, togo, T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.

616
00:41:10,288 --> 00:41:14,169
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura reads and responds to you, some of them on air.

617
00:41:14,609 --> 00:41:15,969
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wrote us this week, DarkSakura?

618
00:41:16,069 --> 00:41:17,650
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to give a nod toward...

619
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:23,433
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an email from a guy named Deacon Deakman.

620
00:41:23,793 --> 00:41:24,613
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty cool.

621
00:41:24,693 --> 00:41:26,634
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's one of those guys on the forums from Australia.

622
00:41:26,914 --> 00:41:39,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and he actually also informed about trying to get the PSP 2.0 firmware and the security flaw about the photos and the DS.

623
00:41:39,361 --> 00:41:40,341
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was cool.

624
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:41,882
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also keeping track of it.

625
00:41:42,711 --> 00:41:49,459
[SPEAKER_02]: He also made a brand new set of emote icons for our forums that are all, I hate to say it, Jamie, but they're all Katamari Damacy related.

626
00:41:49,599 --> 00:41:50,020
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

627
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,921
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're cute!

628
00:41:51,101 --> 00:41:51,962
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so cute!

629
00:41:52,402 --> 00:41:53,383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's awesome.

630
00:41:53,484 --> 00:41:55,766
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put them up as soon as we figure out how.

631
00:41:56,087 --> 00:42:02,254
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got an email from Alv who just says, Ragnarok, Pekos, heal please, yay.

632
00:42:03,802 --> 00:42:07,924
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that would, that just amused me because I was like, oh yeah, it's someone who plays.

633
00:42:07,944 --> 00:42:15,528
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was that 5% I was referencing last week when I said 5% of our listeners will understand the Ragnarok jokes.

634
00:42:16,129 --> 00:42:16,909
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, cute.

635
00:42:17,429 --> 00:42:19,811
[SPEAKER_03]: Also got an email from Q in Singapore.

636
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:22,412
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm spelling that right, pronouncing it right.

637
00:42:23,052 --> 00:42:26,714
[SPEAKER_03]: Just says that Buzz Orange Lounge Radio wanted to know about the songs.

638
00:42:26,734 --> 00:42:30,636
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually emailed back stating, you know, about Orange Lounge and Tawosuke and...

639
00:42:32,097 --> 00:42:33,738
[SPEAKER_03]: for to get the Beatmania CDs.

640
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,598
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that worldwide thing I was talking about.

641
00:42:35,638 --> 00:42:38,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for emailing us and letting us know that we have listeners worldwide.

642
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:45,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a good email from Mike D who's actually on 1up.com.

643
00:42:46,402 --> 00:42:50,724
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote a pretty interesting blog about people reading user and licensing.

644
00:42:51,344 --> 00:42:53,285
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's some funny stuff thrown in there.

645
00:42:54,725 --> 00:43:01,068
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go ahead, it says a people scammed into downloading spyware by sneaking it into the licensing agreement.

646
00:43:01,428 --> 00:43:06,770
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that legally, once you click that I agree, you are signing a contract.

647
00:43:07,090 --> 00:43:09,491
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even remember in my business law classes,

648
00:43:10,271 --> 00:43:13,534
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went into that where that is a legally binding document.

649
00:43:23,727 --> 00:43:24,988
[SPEAKER_02]: Aircraft Navigation or Communication Systems

650
00:43:49,125 --> 00:43:57,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Air Traffic Control Systems, Life Support Machines, or other equipment in which the failure or the software could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

651
00:43:57,952 --> 00:43:58,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

652
00:43:58,652 --> 00:43:59,853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the licensing agreement.

653
00:43:59,893 --> 00:44:00,714
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's hilarious.

654
00:44:00,734 --> 00:44:01,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Windows?

655
00:44:01,415 --> 00:44:08,840
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they could sneak in there, you know, if you use this program and someone calls you a big weenie for using it, don't blame us, you know.

656
00:44:09,561 --> 00:44:13,724
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's, you know, people really should stop and read those licensing agreements.

657
00:44:13,744 --> 00:44:14,965
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a link to the article?

658
00:44:16,006 --> 00:44:39,906
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, it's minime283.oneup.com Okay, so some dude's blog on OneUp, okay Yeah, but, you know, major kudos to them for poisoning I think that's a very interesting thing Because I've even seen jokes snuck into licensing agreements Where it didn't affect the legality of the document one bit But it was, I've seen them done with humor Cool

659
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,497
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a very, very, very valid point.

660
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:48,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, again, we got one.

661
00:44:48,442 --> 00:44:55,571
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted you to make sure that we give our nods to people from Danzik who listed about the DS Wi-Fi that Loki just touched on.

662
00:44:56,972 --> 00:44:59,613
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd just like to thank our listeners.

663
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:07,854
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep sending them in to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com And we can't always read every email on the air because we just get a lot of them, but Jamie does read them all.

664
00:45:08,654 --> 00:45:19,576
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, and I reply to almost all of them, although honestly I'm at work, so I may not... If I seem a little distracted sometimes in my reply... And let me reiterate that.

665
00:45:19,636 --> 00:45:22,897
[SPEAKER_02]: When you send an email to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com, Jamie does read them.

666
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:28,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which I found incredibly hilarious for one of the other emails I received.

667
00:45:28,489 --> 00:45:29,990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, one of the ones we don't read on the air.

668
00:45:30,791 --> 00:45:31,092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

669
00:45:31,212 --> 00:45:31,772
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it all.

670
00:45:32,954 --> 00:45:43,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that we get, and I almost always reply to it unless it's just something like, oh my god, and then I'm just like, deleted.

671
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:47,136
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you guys who take out the time to email us.

672
00:45:48,096 --> 00:45:49,876
[SPEAKER_02]: And waste part of Jamie's work day.

673
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:50,697
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that.

674
00:45:50,757 --> 00:45:52,437
[SPEAKER_02]: No, waste it for a good cause.

675
00:45:52,717 --> 00:45:54,678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it definitely makes my day go faster.

676
00:45:54,718 --> 00:45:56,678
[SPEAKER_02]: 2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, once again.

677
00:45:57,098 --> 00:45:58,979
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, we have other email addresses this week.

678
00:45:58,999 --> 00:46:01,740
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a full email because we've got our giveaway.

679
00:46:02,020 --> 00:46:05,621
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, we're giving away DDR Extreme 2 and Max 2 VRares.

680
00:46:06,081 --> 00:46:08,242
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

681
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:08,762
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff.

682
00:46:08,962 --> 00:46:09,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send an email.

683
00:46:10,162 --> 00:46:10,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else required.

684
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:12,123
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say, hi, I want to win.

685
00:46:12,163 --> 00:46:12,823
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to put.

686
00:46:12,843 --> 00:46:13,043
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

687
00:46:13,223 --> 00:46:15,224
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't sell your email to anybody.

688
00:46:15,244 --> 00:46:15,925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not cool.

689
00:46:16,365 --> 00:46:17,186
[SPEAKER_02]: No strings attached.

690
00:46:17,786 --> 00:46:19,928
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is the in the groove we're giving away.

691
00:46:20,128 --> 00:46:20,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Your haiku.

692
00:46:20,888 --> 00:46:23,730
[SPEAKER_02]: Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables.

693
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:25,932
[SPEAKER_02]: Haiku at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

694
00:46:26,482 --> 00:46:27,944
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple stories left tonight.

695
00:46:28,524 --> 00:46:37,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Myst V is coming out, and they are calling this the final chapter in the PC adventure game saga coming out from Ubisoft.

696
00:46:37,835 --> 00:46:38,936
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, yeah, right.

697
00:46:39,036 --> 00:46:44,182
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as these games continue to sell, which I don't know how well Myst IV sold, but I don't think it was nearly as good as the first couple.

698
00:46:44,763 --> 00:46:44,863
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

699
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:48,658
[SPEAKER_02]: There will always be Myst games or other types.

700
00:46:49,999 --> 00:46:53,441
[SPEAKER_02]: $50 or $49.99 will be how much Myst 5 will set you back.

701
00:46:54,381 --> 00:46:57,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And Myst 5 coming out end of January is what they're looking at.

702
00:46:58,764 --> 00:47:05,488
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a limited edition coming out that includes a retrospective on DVD made by Turner Broadcasting.

703
00:47:05,848 --> 00:47:06,349
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of a

704
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,351
[SPEAKER_02]: Well produced documentary.

705
00:47:08,371 --> 00:47:10,934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it'll be $60 if you want that version.

706
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:11,795
[SPEAKER_02]: Myst fans.

707
00:47:12,176 --> 00:47:13,537
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Myst was a pretty cool game.

708
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:16,581
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of those series that maybe... I actually have it on Saturn somewhere.

709
00:47:16,881 --> 00:47:18,844
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of those games that maybe jumped the shark a little bit.

710
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:22,588
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always... Didn't Myst come out around the same time as The Seventh Guest?

711
00:47:22,848 --> 00:47:23,269
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that?

712
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:24,791
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very kind of similar in a way.

713
00:47:25,031 --> 00:47:27,052
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember another game that was out at that time that I liked.

714
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:28,292
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantasmagoria.

715
00:47:28,552 --> 00:47:29,873
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, heck yeah, Phantasmagoria.

716
00:47:29,893 --> 00:47:31,073
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new Phantasmagoria.

717
00:47:31,393 --> 00:47:34,654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Roberta Williams is associated with Sierra anymore.

718
00:47:34,814 --> 00:47:35,114
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

719
00:47:35,254 --> 00:47:37,395
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Phantasmagoria, heck yeah.

720
00:47:38,676 --> 00:47:40,056
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventh Guest, heck yeah, missed.

721
00:47:40,236 --> 00:47:41,236
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure, why not?

722
00:47:41,296 --> 00:47:42,437
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I liked Loom.

723
00:47:43,377 --> 00:47:46,498
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other one.

724
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:49,699
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, close us out tonight.

725
00:47:49,719 --> 00:47:51,240
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the last stories you got for us tonight?

726
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,081
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is, for some reason, unbeknownst to me...

727
00:47:55,453 --> 00:47:59,356
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanna Dark from Perfect Dark Zero is on the cover of 4Him Magazine.

728
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:03,159
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this maybe a response to the Playboy thing?

729
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:04,901
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, by the way, I still need to pick up.

730
00:48:05,621 --> 00:48:07,943
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise I will not let you guys down.

731
00:48:08,063 --> 00:48:09,444
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pick up the magazine.

732
00:48:10,305 --> 00:48:11,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

733
00:48:12,147 --> 00:48:13,588
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

734
00:48:13,968 --> 00:48:19,633
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, finally, we see all those mods that shrink stuff down, make stuff portable.

735
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:22,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we want to take something small and make it big.

736
00:48:23,752 --> 00:48:30,580
[SPEAKER_01]: G4 did it with their Nintendo controller, but I think this guy won up them by making the Nintendo Game Man.

737
00:48:31,421 --> 00:48:37,709
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Game Man is actually a 100-pound version of the Game Boy.

738
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:37,849
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 6...

739
00:48:38,690 --> 00:48:40,771
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half times the scale of the Game Boy.

740
00:48:40,831 --> 00:48:43,473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Game Boy's been out for like, what, 15 years now?

741
00:48:43,513 --> 00:48:45,714
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's had plenty of time to go through puberty and all that.

742
00:48:45,734 --> 00:48:47,115
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's matured into a man now.

743
00:48:47,155 --> 00:48:50,737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's over three feet tall and weighs just over 100 pounds.

744
00:48:51,417 --> 00:48:58,802
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cartridges, he actually made cartridges for it with Kirby's Dream Land, Pokemon Red, Super Mario Land, and Tetris.

745
00:48:59,182 --> 00:49:02,203
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all very playable and they're eight pound cartridges.

746
00:49:02,884 --> 00:49:08,207
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually plug it in and they've got pictures on his website of him actually playing the game.

747
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:14,670
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura and I are sitting back here and we can't help but think of Now you're a man Man, man, man Anyway, forget it

748
00:49:39,008 --> 00:49:39,468
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad joke.

749
00:49:39,488 --> 00:49:41,549
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys got that, I hope you did.

750
00:49:42,109 --> 00:49:46,251
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should be noted, though, that the page here, it says copyright 2002.

751
00:49:46,472 --> 00:49:47,692
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually three years old.

752
00:49:48,092 --> 00:49:48,853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old thing.

753
00:49:48,893 --> 00:49:49,833
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you just find this?

754
00:49:49,873 --> 00:49:51,534
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just on a blog lately or something?

755
00:49:51,934 --> 00:49:52,194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

756
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:53,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

757
00:49:53,275 --> 00:49:53,615
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

758
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:54,375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

759
00:49:54,395 --> 00:49:55,096
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fine.

760
00:49:55,256 --> 00:49:56,256
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to make now?

761
00:49:56,316 --> 00:49:57,397
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Man SP?

762
00:49:59,598 --> 00:50:00,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

763
00:50:00,318 --> 00:50:00,678
[SPEAKER_01]: Shush.

764
00:50:02,859 --> 00:50:04,100
[SPEAKER_03]: What, geriatric game?

765
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:09,877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just interesting I would like to see them make a 6.5 scale DS

766
00:50:12,639 --> 00:50:13,219
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

767
00:50:13,359 --> 00:50:16,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just, you have to rub your whole body on it to get anything going.

768
00:50:16,560 --> 00:50:18,080
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to just wipe it with your hands.

769
00:50:18,340 --> 00:50:23,221
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely forgot one last thing I gotta mention because this was just funny that I saw this.

770
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:27,683
[SPEAKER_01]: For the DS, someone actually made a homebrew game called Tickle Girl.

771
00:50:28,263 --> 00:50:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

772
00:50:29,363 --> 00:50:33,104
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta see the screen, or the box art that they made for it.

773
00:50:33,164 --> 00:50:34,184
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite hilarious.

774
00:50:34,404 --> 00:50:37,945
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it what we think a game called Tickle Girl for the DS would be?

775
00:50:38,845 --> 00:50:47,090
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Tickle Girl version 1.0 and it says basically it's a multimedia experience where you interact with a virtual vixen via the touchscreen.

776
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:50,152
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickle different areas of your dream girl to watch her reaction.

777
00:50:50,232 --> 00:50:53,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizes full motion video, sampled audio, and looping background music.

778
00:50:53,714 --> 00:51:01,959
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we feel the magic XXXY had something similar to this though because there was modes where you could kind of touch the girl and if you tried to touch her in a naughty place she'd jump back and get mad at you.

779
00:51:03,529 --> 00:51:05,430
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody just took this idea in one update.

780
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:08,512
[SPEAKER_01]: They also mentioned that it's as if you feel the magic, you'll love this.

781
00:51:08,653 --> 00:51:16,118
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can run homebrew stuff on your DS, you can download it at ndsupdates.com.

782
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:17,279
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

783
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:18,780
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, all right.

784
00:51:20,322 --> 00:51:21,683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of the show, guys.

785
00:51:21,823 --> 00:51:22,543
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

786
00:51:23,284 --> 00:51:31,470
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I have to go grocery shopping, and there's no better time to go grocery shopping than one in the morning on a weekend.

787
00:51:32,010 --> 00:51:32,411
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

788
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,440
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to buy something.

789
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:40,343
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what it is, but I have this urge to buy something, and so I'm thinking it's going to be something game-related.

790
00:51:40,543 --> 00:51:41,184
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy me a car.

791
00:51:41,984 --> 00:51:42,084
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

792
00:51:43,726 --> 00:51:44,326
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

793
00:51:45,047 --> 00:51:46,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject sexism in video games.

794
00:51:47,751 --> 00:51:51,492
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, that's going to do it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

795
