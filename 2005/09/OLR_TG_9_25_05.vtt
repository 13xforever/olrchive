[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for gaming news, gamer chat...

00:28.649 --> 00:29.049
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

00:53.064 --> 00:53.906
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, what up?

00:54.046 --> 00:54.567
[SPEAKER_02]: How you doing?

00:55.448 --> 00:57.151
[SPEAKER_03]: I am doing remarkably well tonight.

00:57.311 --> 00:57.972
[SPEAKER_02]: Good, good to hear.

00:58.333 --> 00:59.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how you doing?

00:59.414 --> 01:00.656
[SPEAKER_02]: Our Tech Master Loki's here too.

01:00.957 --> 01:01.398
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good.

01:02.082 --> 01:02.322
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

01:02.562 --> 01:02.863
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:03.343 --> 01:04.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's get started.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.946
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do... Actually, no, I do have one announcement because this is major.

01:07.966 --> 01:08.647
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two announcements.

01:09.087 --> 01:10.028
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep thinking of new announcements.

01:10.568 --> 01:14.531
[SPEAKER_02]: One, definitely check out our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:14.971 --> 01:18.774
[SPEAKER_02]: On the website, Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief.

01:19.074 --> 01:20.175
[SPEAKER_02]: That drive is still going.

01:20.235 --> 01:20.735
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.

01:20.775 --> 01:26.799
[SPEAKER_02]: It's us, Dark Records, and Club 21, some businesses in Sacramento where this show is based.

01:27.080 --> 01:31.623
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're doing a worldwide effort because our podcast reaches worldwide to help raise...

01:32.404 --> 01:39.335
[SPEAKER_02]: Awareness, really, and funds and donations for not only the human survivors of Hurricane Katrina, but animals as well.

01:39.816 --> 01:41.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely a very important...

01:42.679 --> 01:43.039
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura

02:11.468 --> 02:19.031
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, while my husband's been out of town at the GameStop Manager Conference in Texas, I've been trying to entertain myself as best as I can.

02:19.631 --> 02:20.511
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of Nintendogs.

02:21.472 --> 02:23.992
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft, which is excellent.

02:25.633 --> 02:32.975
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually hopping over on the MAME and playing Puyo Puyo, Blazing Star, Polestar, Metal Slug 5, Kix...

02:35.216 --> 02:37.218
[SPEAKER_02]: PC Engine Core Graphics to play more Valkyrie Densetsu

02:51.860 --> 02:57.702
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to come over sometime because I don't know anywhere else where I could play this except your house, which is the Walking Talking Video Game Museum.

02:58.122 --> 02:59.303
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to play Alien Crush.

02:59.943 --> 03:00.323
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it.

03:00.543 --> 03:02.644
[SPEAKER_02]: I have this urge for some TurboGrafx.

03:02.664 --> 03:04.264
[SPEAKER_02]: I have Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.

03:04.345 --> 03:07.646
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to play the Crush games, I want to play Splatterhouse, and I want to play Bonk.

03:07.746 --> 03:09.887
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have a TurboGrafx night, and I know you would have it all.

03:09.907 --> 03:15.529
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what, we need to, I need to get two more controllers, but we hook up the multi-tap and it's all about four-player Bomberman.

03:17.170 --> 03:17.491
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm down.

03:17.792 --> 03:18.795
[SPEAKER_03]: I have Batman 94.

03:19.417 --> 03:20.540
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to do that.

03:20.641 --> 03:21.864
[SPEAKER_02]: We can talk about that on a future podcast.

03:21.884 --> 03:23.228
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Marathon Dracula X.

03:25.596 --> 03:27.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of kicks, I have to ask Loki real quick.

03:28.858 --> 03:36.401
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcade Infinity in L.A., which has a lot of import games, a lot of Japanese games, I remember one time we went there.

03:36.521 --> 03:38.262
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we took a random trip to L.A.

03:38.662 --> 03:45.986
[SPEAKER_02]: like last Christmas or something, and there was a game that you were playing nonstop that was very much like kicks, except it was a woman's dress.

03:46.426 --> 03:51.568
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you would trace the lines around the woman's dress, I guess it would fall off or whatever it was.

03:51.648 --> 03:52.389
[SPEAKER_02]: What was that game?

03:52.429 --> 03:53.309
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember anything about this?

03:53.509 --> 03:55.030
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't remember what the 3D game was.

03:55.866 --> 03:57.327
[SPEAKER_01]: because they had a 3D game.

03:57.387 --> 03:58.707
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of them that I was playing.

03:58.727 --> 04:06.570
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other games that I play, I still play religiously on, well, when I have the damn PC for my main cabinet, Gal's Panic.

04:07.571 --> 04:08.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, of course.

04:09.271 --> 04:11.532
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss World was a bastardization of 6.

04:11.572 --> 04:12.493
[SPEAKER_01]: That was crap.

04:13.213 --> 04:16.794
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other one, the 3D one, I don't remember what it's called, but that one was a lot of fun too.

04:16.814 --> 04:17.575
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little different.

04:18.155 --> 04:21.896
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually played all the way through that twice when we were there the last time.

04:21.916 --> 04:22.336
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.

04:22.657 --> 04:23.597
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else in your gaming world?

04:25.036 --> 04:27.299
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually handing down a copy of Chowai Nikki.

04:28.099 --> 04:28.480
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?

04:29.020 --> 04:32.403
[SPEAKER_03]: Interesting little shooter game that has, like, musclemen in it.

04:33.765 --> 04:34.045
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.

04:34.065 --> 04:35.947
[SPEAKER_03]: And, like, these fantasy-looking characters.

04:36.307 --> 04:39.490
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the family of Parodius, as far as the type of game.

04:39.510 --> 04:40.751
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's what, guys?

04:41.672 --> 04:42.573
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really weird.

04:43.013 --> 04:44.114
[SPEAKER_03]: It means super big brother.

04:45.756 --> 04:46.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

04:46.597 --> 04:46.677
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

04:49.924 --> 04:55.547
[SPEAKER_03]: The first in the series had these two sort of fantasy-looking characters, and they would fly around and shoot things.

04:55.627 --> 05:03.530
[SPEAKER_03]: And later on, they had these two just really... It's hard to describe them, but they were shiny.

05:04.391 --> 05:07.372
[SPEAKER_03]: Musclemen and Speedos, who would go around shooting stuff.

05:08.092 --> 05:08.993
[SPEAKER_03]: They even did a...

05:13.760 --> 05:16.502
[SPEAKER_03]: A real life, like how Mortal Kombat was.

05:17.303 --> 05:18.905
[SPEAKER_03]: The stop animation.

05:19.265 --> 05:20.286
[SPEAKER_02]: Not like Pit Fighter.

05:20.426 --> 05:21.327
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, motion capture.

05:21.367 --> 05:29.414
[SPEAKER_03]: But not really motion capture because they were kind of like Pit Fighter where you take the pictures of people in different poses and then you animate them.

05:29.514 --> 05:31.716
[SPEAKER_02]: Pit Fighter is one of my least favorite arcade games of all time.

05:32.436 --> 05:32.897
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

05:50.094 --> 05:56.278
[SPEAKER_03]: And hey, if you want to see me slap down $1,000 on a video game, find me a copy of Rainbow Cotton.

05:57.319 --> 05:58.640
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Rainbow Cotton, Panorama Cotton.

05:59.801 --> 06:02.082
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard you talk about this game before.

06:02.122 --> 06:03.043
[SPEAKER_02]: What's so great about this game?

06:04.433 --> 06:05.674
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, the Cotton series of games.

06:05.734 --> 06:08.856
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually got one in the States on Neo Geo Pocket Color.

06:09.036 --> 06:13.118
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about a little witch who's addicted to this candy called Willow that makes her puke.

06:14.599 --> 06:17.020
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was a side-scrolling game.

06:18.601 --> 06:23.244
[SPEAKER_03]: And for anyone who has a Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton was the one on Dreamcast, but this one is a behind-the-view one.

06:23.724 --> 06:30.788
[SPEAKER_03]: The really cool thing about it on the Genesis, first of all, they only made something like 600 copies, so it was very limited edition.

06:31.708 --> 06:37.710
[SPEAKER_03]: and it had really advanced scrolling techniques that you really at the time could only see on Super Nintendo.

06:38.350 --> 06:38.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

06:39.070 --> 06:39.230
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

06:39.891 --> 06:48.293
[SPEAKER_03]: Just, I say, it's the Gens emulator is the only one I know that will run it, but if you find the ROM of Panorama Cotton, give it a try.

06:48.713 --> 06:50.614
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Panorama, but, yeah, Panorama Cotton.

06:51.172 --> 06:51.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, okay.

06:52.073 --> 06:54.215
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to see this just for the witch who's puking.

06:54.275 --> 06:55.115
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds kind of weird.

06:55.175 --> 06:56.296
[SPEAKER_03]: I almost cosplayed her one year.

06:56.516 --> 07:02.942
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I will bring over my boot disc and my copy of Rainbow Cod to show you.

07:02.982 --> 07:03.482
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check it out.

07:03.502 --> 07:03.982
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to check it out.

07:04.183 --> 07:04.423
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

07:04.843 --> 07:05.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, how's your game week been?

07:06.444 --> 07:07.125
[SPEAKER_01]: I played Burnout.

07:07.706 --> 07:08.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Revenge, yeah.

07:08.286 --> 07:08.626
[SPEAKER_02]: Again?

07:09.027 --> 07:10.328
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, I played every break.

07:10.708 --> 07:11.188
[SPEAKER_01]: Every break.

07:11.228 --> 07:14.411
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we've got to race the cars and blow up and crash and all that fun stuff.

07:14.853 --> 07:14.973
[SPEAKER_01]: R.P.G.

07:14.993 --> 07:15.153
[SPEAKER_01]: Maker 3

07:43.117 --> 07:43.957
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

08:13.627 --> 08:14.267
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what'd you think?

08:14.488 --> 08:14.868
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

08:15.028 --> 08:15.388
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty cool.

08:15.468 --> 08:18.169
[SPEAKER_03]: It has so much customization in it.

08:18.229 --> 08:18.950
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.

08:19.370 --> 08:19.610
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

08:19.930 --> 08:22.532
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah, I'd say that's going to be a worthy purchase.

08:23.272 --> 08:24.933
[SPEAKER_01]: Still working on the RPG for us.

08:25.453 --> 08:25.773
[SPEAKER_01]: Still.

08:26.094 --> 08:26.494
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.036
[SPEAKER_01]: Never going to finish it, but it'll... Orange Lounge the game.

08:30.416 --> 08:31.877
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

08:31.897 --> 08:33.758
[SPEAKER_03]: Better than Sky's Voice the game, wouldn't you think?

08:33.818 --> 08:34.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes.

08:34.778 --> 08:36.579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an old-ass live show joke.

08:36.599 --> 08:37.300
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to bring it up.

08:37.380 --> 08:37.620
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

08:37.680 --> 08:38.440
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like two years old.

08:38.540 --> 08:38.880
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

08:39.361 --> 08:41.962
[SPEAKER_01]: Did play some more Burnout Legends, and that game's still fun.

08:42.540 --> 08:43.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Burnout, Burnout, Burnout, Burnout.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.601
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to play other things than Burnout this week, I promise.

08:48.341 --> 08:48.681
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?

08:48.741 --> 08:53.902
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, my week wasn't much better because I pretty much played games I've already talked about on the show, so I don't have a whole lot else to add.

08:53.962 --> 08:54.282
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

08:55.003 --> 08:58.463
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the usual Final Fantasy XI.

08:58.823 --> 09:05.525
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of We Heart Katamari because I picked up that game this week and I've just been playing the shit out of it.

09:05.645 --> 09:11.126
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, if you liked the first game, I love some of the things they did with this game.

09:11.166 --> 09:11.306
[SPEAKER_02]: Now,

09:11.906 --> 09:18.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, I know on the three-hour show tonight you expressed your difficulties you're having with We Heart Katamari, but I'm saving this.

09:18.574 --> 09:19.695
[SPEAKER_02]: I saved this just for you.

09:19.975 --> 09:24.240
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a stage in We Heart Katamari where you get to roll around a big ball of fire.

09:25.273 --> 09:25.953
[SPEAKER_02]: I like fire.

09:26.033 --> 09:31.216
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a giant ball of fire and the goal is to take this fire and light a wood pile on fire.

09:31.477 --> 09:33.358
[SPEAKER_02]: And you roll over objects to make your ball bigger.

09:33.658 --> 09:37.020
[SPEAKER_02]: Except it's the one stage where you can't roll over people for obvious reasons.

09:37.280 --> 09:37.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn!

09:37.760 --> 09:43.203
[SPEAKER_02]: If you do hit people though, they catch on fire and they run away screaming and they'll jump into ponds and rivers and stuff.

09:43.744 --> 09:44.704
[SPEAKER_03]: That is excellent.

09:45.004 --> 09:47.286
[SPEAKER_02]: So, does that redeem the game a little bit for you?

09:47.766 --> 09:49.047
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the game I'm mad at.

09:49.267 --> 09:49.707
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

09:49.747 --> 09:51.028
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm mad at everyone talking about it.

09:51.781 --> 09:52.343
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to.

09:52.523 --> 09:54.346
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a big part of my gaming weekend.

09:54.887 --> 09:55.268
[SPEAKER_02]: Deal.

09:55.709 --> 09:56.110
[SPEAKER_01]: Deal.

09:56.451 --> 09:57.533
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta mention one more thing.

09:57.573 --> 09:57.773
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

09:58.154 --> 09:59.957
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how you got Mortal Kombat Shell and Monks?

09:59.997 --> 10:00.198
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.262
[SPEAKER_01]: Before it was supposed to come out.

10:03.204 --> 10:03.745
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it really?

10:04.127 --> 10:09.251
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it wasn't supposed to street until the 21st, and Midway... I got Midway in trouble, and that was fun.

10:09.471 --> 10:09.832
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?

10:09.952 --> 10:10.692
[SPEAKER_01]: I snitched on them.

10:11.133 --> 10:11.953
[SPEAKER_02]: You snitched?

10:12.073 --> 10:12.674
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

10:12.754 --> 10:14.195
[SPEAKER_01]: No, um, they don't know.

10:14.616 --> 10:17.718
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know, but it was not supposed to be in stores until the 21st.

10:17.758 --> 10:20.240
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, lucky me, I guess.

10:20.300 --> 10:27.586
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it was once again one of those things that I got at our purchasing department to call them, and Midway's like, I don't even know what happened.

10:27.786 --> 10:30.729
[SPEAKER_01]: So, they've got something explaining to do.

10:31.482 --> 10:32.022
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

10:53.715 --> 10:56.036
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII has a street date.

10:56.096 --> 10:59.198
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII will be coming out November 22nd.

10:59.218 --> 11:00.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, what else is happening November 22nd?

11:00.779 --> 11:00.839
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

11:00.859 --> 11:02.680
[SPEAKER_02]: This is coming from a gaming website here.

11:02.700 --> 11:04.461
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they just changed it or what.

11:04.541 --> 11:06.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if they just changed it, cool.

11:06.181 --> 11:07.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, it's December.

11:21.816 --> 11:24.518
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragon Quest VIII will come with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XII.

11:41.900 --> 11:43.420
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's... Cha-ching!

11:43.620 --> 11:45.421
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, I think that's the change.

11:45.501 --> 11:53.963
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what happened is now they're putting in this demo of Final Fantasy XII to try and take a little bit, even though the Xbox 360 is going to be huge, a little bit of attention away from that.

11:54.283 --> 12:03.926
[SPEAKER_01]: The only gripe I have about this game is it's done by the same artist that does Dragon Ball Z and I hate Dragon Ball Z. I hate it to death and it just looks like Dragon Ball Z the game again.

12:05.046 --> 12:06.988
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sick enough that I will buy this just for the demo.

12:07.008 --> 12:07.608
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the thing, though.

12:07.648 --> 12:10.009
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing coming out really the week of the 22nd.

12:10.149 --> 12:17.914
[SPEAKER_01]: There is about 500 titles coming out in the week of the 15th, which is annoying as hell for people that are preparing.

12:18.034 --> 12:23.437
[SPEAKER_01]: All the 360 launch games are coming out that day, or the week before, which is nice because I get mine shipped early.

12:25.576 --> 12:28.357
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand, though, because they all want to cash in on the day after Thanksgiving.

12:28.497 --> 12:29.097
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you have to.

12:29.117 --> 12:34.179
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to have your games out by then, or they're not going to be a part of the Christmas season, you know, unless you release them.

12:34.760 --> 12:39.862
[SPEAKER_02]: But every day you lose between November 26th or, I don't know, I don't have a calendar for it.

12:39.942 --> 12:41.823
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of good games coming out that day.

12:42.443 --> 12:44.504
[SPEAKER_01]: King Kong, the 50 Cent game.

12:45.939 --> 12:46.239
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR Max 2 VRare

13:07.037 --> 13:12.003
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Max 2 came out two years ago, but the VRare, you can't find it now.

13:12.263 --> 13:16.608
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't already have a copy of this VRare, this is one of the only ways you're going to get it short of eBay.

13:16.948 --> 13:19.571
[SPEAKER_02]: So we already gave one away on the live show tonight.

13:19.611 --> 13:22.494
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats to Fireboma, who won the...

13:24.116 --> 13:25.037
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see you next time.

13:46.754 --> 13:47.275
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you call that?

13:48.195 --> 13:50.737
[SPEAKER_03]: Restrictions other than multiple entries.

13:51.057 --> 13:51.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple entries.

13:52.098 --> 13:54.620
[SPEAKER_02]: We will catch you and we will disqualify you completely.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.582
[SPEAKER_02]: One entry per person, please.

13:58.162 --> 14:00.343
[SPEAKER_02]: No strings attached to the contest.

14:00.383 --> 14:01.244
[SPEAKER_02]: You just send us an email.

14:01.324 --> 14:02.385
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to send us a...

14:03.739 --> 14:04.080
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.881
[SPEAKER_02]: No zombies apply.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.302
[SPEAKER_02]: All you have to do is send us an email.

14:07.322 --> 14:07.803
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that simple.

14:07.823 --> 14:08.824
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll pick one and we'll give it away.

14:09.064 --> 14:10.505
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not the last time we're going to be doing this.

14:10.565 --> 14:13.528
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be having some more kick-ass stuff coming your way.

14:13.568 --> 14:14.288
[SPEAKER_01]: More games and stuff.

14:14.388 --> 14:14.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.

14:14.889 --> 14:18.952
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting to get the hook up, so we're going to give away more games throughout future podcasts.

14:19.012 --> 14:19.553
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got it.

14:20.208 --> 14:21.009
[SPEAKER_01]: I got some.

14:21.270 --> 14:21.951
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a supply.

14:36.232 --> 14:37.393
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just dropped it on the ground.

14:37.653 --> 14:41.014
[SPEAKER_02]: We've all already defaced it.

14:41.074 --> 14:44.656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a sealed copy because we've all autographed it among other things.

14:45.277 --> 14:47.418
[SPEAKER_02]: We put our own spin on this copy of In the Groove.

14:47.438 --> 14:48.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Just look at the inside cover.

14:48.718 --> 14:50.979
[SPEAKER_02]: We're giving it away to a lucky listener.

14:51.039 --> 14:52.820
[SPEAKER_02]: However, this one's a little more complicated.

14:53.361 --> 14:55.182
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to show your poetic side.

14:55.542 --> 15:05.907
[SPEAKER_02]: You must send your best haiku about In the Groove to this email address haiku at orangelaunchradio.com For those of you guys that can't spell, that's H

15:06.287 --> 15:09.628
[SPEAKER_02]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

15:32.498 --> 15:34.480
[SPEAKER_02]: We had such a great show last week, didn't we?

15:55.422 --> 15:55.963
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

16:15.080 --> 16:19.566
[SPEAKER_02]: And remember, guys, we do this because we can't talk about video games all day long.

16:19.906 --> 16:26.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if all we ever did is talk about video games all day long, we'd have no time to deface PlayStation 2 games and give them away.

16:27.676 --> 16:29.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it is a completely working copy.

16:29.058 --> 16:29.759
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't ruin the game.

16:32.737 --> 16:39.202
[SPEAKER_02]: And for those of you guys that are getting a little angsty, fans at home, by the way, saying, why do you guys have to do that to Indigree?

16:39.342 --> 16:39.942
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can.

16:40.423 --> 16:41.223
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we're giving it away.

16:41.263 --> 16:41.724
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we can.

16:41.804 --> 16:47.748
[SPEAKER_02]: We bought one, wrote on it, and now we're giving it away because we can.

16:48.108 --> 16:52.812
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally didn't like the game, so I bought one just so I could write, this game sucks on it.

16:52.972 --> 16:55.334
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I did, and we just went a little further from that.

16:55.354 --> 16:56.114
[SPEAKER_02]: But think of it this way.

16:56.374 --> 16:57.916
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki supported Indigree.

16:57.996 --> 16:59.737
[SPEAKER_02]: We did not get this free from the company.

17:00.413 --> 17:01.034
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura DarkSakura

17:25.953 --> 17:28.574
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's piece of advice is how to survive a hit and run.

17:30.074 --> 17:34.616
[SPEAKER_03]: Number one, if a car is headed directly for you, assess the amount of time you have.

17:35.016 --> 17:37.036
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, oh shit, I got five minutes!

17:37.697 --> 17:38.937
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, oh shit, I'm dead!

17:39.177 --> 17:40.657
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, no!

17:41.218 --> 17:41.858
[SPEAKER_03]: Steve Muller.

17:42.478 --> 17:46.839
[SPEAKER_03]: Two, dive and roll out of the car's path if you have enough time before impact.

17:47.279 --> 17:49.920
[SPEAKER_03]: You may get some cuts and bruises, but you will not get run over.

17:50.560 --> 17:50.941
[SPEAKER_03]: Duh!

17:51.701 --> 17:51.861
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.

17:53.008 --> 17:56.530
[SPEAKER_03]: 3.

17:53.628 --> 17:56.530
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't get out of the way, jump as high as you can before impact.

17:56.890 --> 18:00.112
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump in a tight tuck or ball position with your arms over your head.

18:00.752 --> 18:03.053
[SPEAKER_03]: Jump in profile with your shoulder toward the car.

18:03.113 --> 18:04.774
[SPEAKER_03]: This exposes fewer vital organs.

18:05.715 --> 18:04.774
4.

18:05.855 --> 18:06.675
[SPEAKER_03]: Brace for impact.

18:07.236 --> 18:08.676
[SPEAKER_03]: You will probably hit the windshield.

18:09.797 --> 18:08.676
5.

18:10.357 --> 18:12.558
[SPEAKER_03]: Roll onto and off the windshield.

18:13.639 --> 18:12.558
6.

18:14.059 --> 18:16.480
[SPEAKER_03]: Stay rolled into a ball and brace yourself for when you hit the ground.

18:16.540 --> 18:18.041
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep your arms over your head. 7.

18:19.912 --> 18:20.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, I heard a rumor.

18:20.652 --> 18:20.712
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

18:44.932 --> 18:46.453
[SPEAKER_03]: That I read online, so it must be true.

18:46.693 --> 18:47.053
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?

18:47.633 --> 18:51.856
[SPEAKER_03]: That there's a huge rumor that News Corp is going to be buying NCSoft.

18:52.796 --> 18:53.237
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?

18:53.677 --> 18:55.278
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, we know what NCSoft brought us.

18:55.458 --> 18:57.399
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't they bring us Guild Wars?

18:57.499 --> 19:01.361
[SPEAKER_03]: Guild Wars, City of Heroes, Lineage, City of Villains.

19:02.445 --> 19:10.813
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny that you bring up Guild Wars because I was just about to get to the next story that Guild Wars actually sold 1 million copies.

19:10.933 --> 19:12.114
[SPEAKER_02]: They are very happy about that.

19:12.154 --> 19:15.177
[SPEAKER_02]: Sold their 1 millionth copy of the game since the game launched in April.

19:15.597 --> 19:20.101
[SPEAKER_02]: And to celebrate, Guild Wars Special Edition on October 21st.

19:20.202 --> 19:21.262
[SPEAKER_02]: But the catch?

19:22.484 --> 19:22.864
[SPEAKER_02]: In Europe.

19:24.161 --> 19:25.602
[SPEAKER_02]: The special edition.

19:25.642 --> 19:28.184
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a chance for the Europe folks to get this before we do.

19:28.485 --> 19:30.987
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're not getting it in North America until April.

19:31.687 --> 19:34.289
[SPEAKER_02]: So check that out.

19:34.710 --> 19:35.711
[SPEAKER_02]: $49.99 for a copy of Guild Wars.

19:35.791 --> 19:36.852
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually played this game.

19:37.452 --> 19:39.874
[SPEAKER_02]: What I really like about Guild Wars, I think it's a pretty game.

19:40.194 --> 19:44.098
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like the fact that I can leave it for a few weeks and then just go back.

19:44.138 --> 19:47.861
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not like I had these fees that were accruing the whole time I didn't play.

19:49.122 --> 19:50.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Guild Wars has a really neat business model there.

19:50.923 --> 19:51.524
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like Guild Wars.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.469
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get into Guild Wars.

19:55.310 --> 19:56.413
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it, I didn't care for it.

19:56.994 --> 20:00.882
[SPEAKER_03]: But there are other special editions popping up on other things, aren't there?

20:02.465 --> 20:03.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you enlighten us?

20:04.292 --> 20:06.413
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about Nintendog Special Edition?

20:06.833 --> 20:09.355
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, yeah, okay, I just, I didn't know which one you were mentioning about.

20:09.615 --> 20:10.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, you want to talk about this?

20:10.596 --> 20:11.256
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to talk about it?

20:11.276 --> 20:11.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Why don't you?

20:12.116 --> 20:12.917
[SPEAKER_02]: I certainly will.

20:13.257 --> 20:17.099
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendog Special Edition will be coming out just in time for the holiday season.

20:17.580 --> 20:18.880
[SPEAKER_02]: October 24th is the date.

20:18.900 --> 20:20.681
[SPEAKER_02]: $149.99 is the price that it'll set you back.

20:20.701 --> 20:21.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute.

20:24.395 --> 20:27.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yes, it's not just the game, it's a brand new DS as well.

20:27.857 --> 20:29.619
[SPEAKER_02]: So the DS is $149.99.

20:30.799 --> 20:33.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new colors of DSs, by the way.

20:33.681 --> 20:34.402
[SPEAKER_02]: Brand new colors.

20:34.482 --> 20:37.364
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pink and I believe teal was the other color.

20:37.744 --> 20:38.565
[SPEAKER_02]: Pink and teal.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Comes with a brand new edition of Nintendogs.

20:41.046 --> 20:46.390
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the Best Friends edition, which will have some of the more popular brands from across the three games.

20:46.850 --> 20:52.295
[SPEAKER_02]: Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Beagle, Yorkshire Terrier, and Miniature Dachshund.

20:53.215 --> 20:55.477
[SPEAKER_02]: However, it's not limited to just those six.

20:55.957 --> 21:03.183
[SPEAKER_02]: All 18, just like in the other games, you can unlock all 18 breeds and secretly there's a 19th we know of, the Dalmatian.

21:03.684 --> 21:05.765
[SPEAKER_02]: You can unlock these in the Best Friends game.

21:05.805 --> 21:06.946
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have the Fireman's Hat.

21:07.106 --> 21:09.208
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like you can unlock in the other games as well.

21:09.228 --> 21:10.349
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen the Dalmatian.

21:10.429 --> 21:12.911
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cute because my friend finally got a Fireman's Hat.

21:13.240 --> 21:13.640
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

21:14.280 --> 21:16.841
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can actually unlock other stuff, too, if you play the game long enough.

21:16.881 --> 21:20.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I just unlocked a new room by getting enough trainer points.

21:20.682 --> 21:22.643
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually unlocked the ranch-style house.

21:23.203 --> 21:23.744
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, okay, cool.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.825
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I bought the tatami house instead.

21:27.385 --> 21:27.545
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.

21:27.705 --> 21:31.106
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some really ugly glasses, and I got some stupid sleepy time records.

21:31.551 --> 21:36.835
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit, I'm actually getting a little sick of Nintendogs, but I'm going to try and stick with it, because I just... I like my puppies.

21:36.975 --> 21:41.739
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the kill time until Animal Crossing DS comes out, which is in December.

21:41.839 --> 21:49.205
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to state real quick, you also get with this package a bone-shaped screen cleaner and a paw print Nintendog skin for the system.

21:50.266 --> 21:50.466
[SPEAKER_03]: Aww.

21:50.846 --> 21:55.189
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually have a Nintendog skin for my DS.

21:55.570 --> 21:56.010
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, cool.

21:56.671 --> 21:58.872
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's adorable, and it's one of those removable kind.

21:59.513 --> 21:59.633
[SPEAKER_04]: Hmm.

22:00.154 --> 22:13.274
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those, I'm trying to remember who puts them out, but these Nintendog skins, you can completely save them any time later, and they are, they actually add a bit more softness to holding the system, so that actually, I can play for longer.

22:13.996 --> 22:14.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

22:15.171 --> 22:16.813
[SPEAKER_02]: The Line to Meet Miyamoto was...

22:36.638 --> 22:36.998
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.

22:37.378 --> 22:37.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Huge.

22:37.718 --> 22:38.479
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty tremendous.

22:38.639 --> 22:40.660
[SPEAKER_02]: He said he saw signed power gloves and everything.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would so many people want to come meet Miyamoto, and why is Miyamoto showing up anyway?

22:44.721 --> 22:49.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Miyamoto was there to help promote Nintendogs at the Nintendo World Store.

22:49.943 --> 22:50.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Get this.

22:50.724 --> 22:56.246
[SPEAKER_02]: The first ten people in line got to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto.

22:56.846 --> 22:57.987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.

22:58.587 --> 23:02.830
[SPEAKER_02]: How cool would that be to have Miyamoto's profile in your friends list on your DS?

23:02.890 --> 23:12.095
[SPEAKER_02]: So we heard that, I think somebody had said, I think he had said when he called in that the first person in line was some guy that flew in from Detroit and was there at like Saturday.

23:12.515 --> 23:17.578
[SPEAKER_02]: So this guy definitely earned it, the bark mode with Miyamoto.

23:17.878 --> 23:23.061
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 people were receiving an autograph from Miyamoto.

23:24.673 --> 23:25.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting, though.

23:25.793 --> 23:27.874
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that a lot of DSs were there.

23:28.234 --> 23:37.677
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw people dressed up as Nintendo characters in the pictures we saw, and I'm sure PictoChat galore, Nintendog, BarkMode galore, probably everybody there unlocked all 18 dogs.

23:37.897 --> 23:39.838
[SPEAKER_03]: They were also passing out autographed skins.

23:40.338 --> 23:40.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.

23:40.878 --> 23:47.220
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently they were in gold and silver, which means that the ones that I got with the Nintendo press kit at E3 was a different one.

23:47.740 --> 23:47.980
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

23:48.560 --> 23:51.641
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was pretty interesting that they had those that they were giving out.

23:51.661 --> 23:52.542
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there were a lot of them.

23:53.022 --> 23:53.462
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

23:53.482 --> 23:53.962
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

23:54.369 --> 23:55.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what do you got for us tonight?

23:55.630 --> 23:57.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Something going on in the hack and crack world.

23:57.251 --> 24:00.032
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that there was big, big news in the hack and crack world this week.

24:00.052 --> 24:00.772
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to share this.

24:00.832 --> 24:02.333
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, of course.

24:02.953 --> 24:13.579
[SPEAKER_01]: Those people out there trying to break the PSP, they found a way to utilize the photo gallery to actually do what they call a buffer overrun.

24:14.059 --> 24:15.440
[SPEAKER_01]: It allows you basically to...

24:16.033 --> 24:20.155
[SPEAKER_01]: Overload the memory of the PSP to run your own code in there.

24:20.675 --> 24:26.418
[SPEAKER_01]: And they've done everything from Hello World to some sort of Pong demo, which is interesting.

24:27.138 --> 24:28.439
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is only the beginning.

24:28.499 --> 24:35.622
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of a way to maybe possibly run homebrew stuff on 2.0 PSP since the downgrader is probably never going to come out.

24:35.682 --> 24:38.163
[SPEAKER_01]: So, hey, it's something cool.

24:39.084 --> 24:40.685
[SPEAKER_01]: That was one of the cool things.

24:40.725 --> 24:42.926
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one that was worth mentioning is...

24:44.557 --> 24:55.726
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a guy who goes by the name Raph, and he's working on PSP Radio, which is actually a shoutcast program that you can use to listen to shoutcast streams, which is kind of cool.

24:56.227 --> 24:59.049
[SPEAKER_01]: So they've got that coming out, and he's still working on that.

24:59.950 --> 25:05.254
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, aside from the PSP, we've got some stuff on the DS.

25:05.314 --> 25:10.018
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing is the Wi-Fi is almost done being hacked.

25:10.898 --> 25:13.921
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the guy working on it right now is...

25:14.642 --> 25:17.804
[SPEAKER_01]: Trying to create an IRC program for it, which would be really cool.

25:18.004 --> 25:19.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that would be cool.

25:19.645 --> 25:21.947
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's shooting for the prize.

25:22.027 --> 25:24.528
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it was over $2,000 to do that.

25:25.509 --> 25:30.592
[SPEAKER_01]: And other than that, lots of DS stuff coming out in November here.

25:30.932 --> 25:37.237
[SPEAKER_01]: My favorite being Mario Kart DS, which is going to feature all the tracks from, or select tracks from all the series.

25:37.577 --> 25:41.940
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything from the GameCube versions to the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, all that stuff.

25:42.040 --> 25:42.620
[SPEAKER_01]: Rainbow Road.

25:43.140 --> 25:44.201
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, that kind of stuff.

25:45.253 --> 26:13.148
[SPEAKER_01]: and then on top of all that the one I wanted to mention was about the Game Boy Micro and this is kind of interesting someone noticed that when you take the cover off the Game Boy Micro because they have those interchangeable covers the faceplates that there's actually a port that's a 5 volt power port for it and what they're speculating is later on you're going to get faceplates that blink or do weird things or light up or all sorts of weird things so you can have

26:13.541 --> 26:14.702
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Micro Game Boy Micro

26:36.079 --> 26:39.663
[SPEAKER_03]: From what I can see on this, they actually are doing internet-only orders.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.825
[SPEAKER_03]: The last update on the site was on the 13th.

26:44.647 --> 27:01.243
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, my Japanese reading is not the very best, but it looks like they're taking the orders on Amazon, JP, Tsutaya, Yodobashi, Toys R Us, Nintendo, Yamada Denki, Softmap, some of those sites.

27:02.003 --> 27:04.925
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks like it's online order only for those.

27:05.565 --> 27:11.648
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is actually different than the play-on they had for the DS and the SP.

27:11.668 --> 27:14.790
[SPEAKER_03]: This one is specifically built for the Micro.

27:18.952 --> 27:22.934
[SPEAKER_03]: Specs on it, MP3, MPEG, one layer three, you know, the usual.

27:24.775 --> 27:26.296
[SPEAKER_03]: It says it can go up to 128K.

27:26.696 --> 27:26.756
[SPEAKER_03]: Hmm.

27:30.979 --> 27:35.864
[SPEAKER_03]: as far as the... It also will do MPEG-4 video, ASF.

27:36.024 --> 27:37.345
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but 128Ks?

27:37.565 --> 27:39.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, all I see is the band... Never mind.

27:39.747 --> 27:43.491
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was like how much it would hold, and I'm like... No, no, that's... You can't do video with that much.

27:43.671 --> 27:44.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, got it.

27:44.812 --> 27:48.816
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's looking like it's going to rely mostly on the MPEG-4 format for video.

27:48.836 --> 27:50.757
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

27:51.378 --> 27:55.362
[SPEAKER_03]: Just trying to double check, because, again, a lot of this is in...

27:58.203 --> 28:01.006
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it's saying that it can get up to 320k.

28:02.047 --> 28:02.627
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.

28:02.687 --> 28:08.472
[SPEAKER_02]: That's good, because I was going to say, a lot of MP3s, I know I code all mine in 160, so if it capped at 128, that would kind of suck.

28:10.634 --> 28:15.018
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm having to sort of wrap my mind around some of these kanji that I'm not familiar with.

28:15.058 --> 28:15.579
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright.

28:15.719 --> 28:18.542
[SPEAKER_02]: While you're doing that, let me read one other quick story on the micro while we're on that.

28:19.222 --> 28:22.765
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to mention this, that the micro actually came out this week in Japan.

28:22.825 --> 28:27.229
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, we're getting it this week, I believe, the 26th or 27th is when we're getting it?

28:27.289 --> 28:28.030
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the 27th.

28:28.470 --> 28:32.594
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting it this week, but Japan just got it, and how well is it doing in Japan?

28:33.054 --> 28:38.339
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually kind of being seen more as a collectible than an actual system.

28:38.379 --> 28:43.303
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of selling as more of a collectible, but that isn't stopping it from selling huge.

28:43.584 --> 28:44.625
[SPEAKER_02]: For the week of September 12th,

28:45.345 --> 28:45.886
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

29:06.207 --> 29:10.771
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, I believe Earthbound 1 and 2 is on its way to Advance.

29:10.831 --> 29:16.196
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that already came out or just came out, but I know I'm really excited about that because I want to check out this game.

29:16.537 --> 29:16.877
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be cool.

29:17.389 --> 29:18.309
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they put it out over here.

29:18.869 --> 29:20.850
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie, any other details on the player?

29:21.190 --> 29:43.595
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's going over something about media stage that for anything that's 384 looks like K per second and 512 it streams at 30 frames per second but seeing something else about 256 at 15 frames per second so I'm not really getting too much more out of that.

29:43.886 --> 29:44.566
[SPEAKER_02]: We love you in Australia.

29:44.606 --> 29:45.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Send us a plane ticket.

29:45.347 --> 29:47.107
[SPEAKER_02]: We love all our listeners worldwide.

29:47.167 --> 29:47.747
[SPEAKER_02]: You could be in Antarctica.

30:12.645 --> 30:14.966
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you guys worldwide for checking us out.

30:15.026 --> 30:16.307
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you see the rain down in Africa?

30:38.499 --> 30:40.300
[SPEAKER_02]: Hush up and get to the news.

30:40.540 --> 30:41.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bad 80s reference.

30:41.980 --> 30:45.061
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a little bit of UK news.

30:45.101 --> 30:46.661
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been trying to dig up something fun.

30:47.301 --> 30:48.642
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a brighter SP coming out.

30:50.362 --> 30:55.184
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually heard about this, that they're kind of just promoting it as a brighter screen.

30:55.204 --> 31:02.966
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer that the backlit version of the Game Boy Advance SP is coming out to Europe in graphite and pearl blue.

31:04.936 --> 31:10.944
[SPEAKER_03]: The ones that we got, they're actually coming out with the new backlit screens in Europe, too.

31:11.144 --> 31:13.467
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no date listed yet.

31:13.648 --> 31:16.952
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be about the same brightness as the micro, actually.

31:17.052 --> 31:19.596
[SPEAKER_01]: They showed a side-by-side picture with the old one and the new one.

31:19.676 --> 31:20.477
[SPEAKER_01]: Those micros were...

31:20.797 --> 31:21.358
[SPEAKER_01]: They were bright.

31:21.378 --> 31:21.778
[SPEAKER_01]: Flashlights.

31:21.898 --> 31:22.459
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great.

31:23.300 --> 31:39.419
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing referenced that according to the Nintendo spokesperson for UK actually stating now the technology has come down in price enough for backlights to be affordable so basically people aren't going to have to pay anymore for it.

31:39.559 --> 31:40.440
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to be there.

31:42.591 --> 31:42.931
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

31:43.391 --> 31:43.671
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

31:44.972 --> 31:48.853
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a story here now on EB Games, the retailer.

31:49.333 --> 31:52.814
[SPEAKER_02]: They're sold out of Xbox 360s, and the darn thing hasn't even come out yet.

31:53.694 --> 32:00.656
[SPEAKER_02]: If you go to their online store, you're going to get a message that says, We are currently sold out of our popular Xbox 360 bundles.

32:01.056 --> 32:05.257
[SPEAKER_02]: Check back frequently for more opportunities to pre-order an Xbox 360.

32:05.717 --> 32:08.218
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear GameStop is also...

32:09.048 --> 32:10.190
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

32:24.048 --> 32:29.051
[SPEAKER_02]: General, Xbox 360s, both the Basics and the Super Pack.

32:29.131 --> 32:30.192
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't remember what they're calling them.

32:30.552 --> 32:31.793
[SPEAKER_01]: The 300 and the 400 one.

32:32.133 --> 32:34.335
[SPEAKER_01]: Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Core.

32:34.535 --> 32:34.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

32:35.976 --> 32:37.096
[SPEAKER_02]: You can still buy those.

32:37.457 --> 32:41.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you can do what I do, and I like to rush the store the day it comes out.

32:41.919 --> 32:43.781
[SPEAKER_02]: Rush Best Buy or somebody that doesn't do pre-orders.

32:43.941 --> 32:45.442
[SPEAKER_01]: Mine's already paid for all the way.

32:45.562 --> 32:47.423
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to rush a store when it comes out.

32:47.503 --> 32:48.283
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know which one yet.

32:48.383 --> 32:49.164
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a store in mind.

32:49.918 --> 32:49.958
[SPEAKER_02]: D.D.

32:49.998 --> 32:50.298
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcaholic D.D.

32:50.318 --> 32:50.498
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcaholic

33:15.922 --> 33:16.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Donovan Kiyoshi

33:36.480 --> 33:41.802
[SPEAKER_01]: And this would be a controller for the Xbox 360 was sold on eBay.

33:41.822 --> 33:43.483
[SPEAKER_01]: They have one now that's for $91.

33:43.623 --> 33:47.044
[SPEAKER_01]: It was actually purchased and ended.

33:47.524 --> 33:54.047
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's actually another one up on eBay right now that's for sale and it's going in the $160 range for price.

33:54.407 --> 33:58.008
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, really people, I don't know why you're buying this because it's retarded.

33:58.328 --> 33:59.309
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming back out.

33:59.389 --> 34:01.670
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the system stuff is going to be sold, the accessories.

34:02.130 --> 34:03.951
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you this much, the quarter controller is like $30.

34:05.256 --> 34:07.538
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not spend $160 for a corded controller.

34:07.838 --> 34:09.340
[SPEAKER_01]: Having it early will do you nothing.

34:10.381 --> 34:12.803
[SPEAKER_01]: Except you can lick it, like the girl did with the PSP.

34:13.203 --> 34:17.107
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to do that if I won that, but I would not bid on this for the life of me, no.

34:17.487 --> 34:20.910
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe a system?

34:21.111 --> 34:21.311
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?

34:21.351 --> 34:22.612
[SPEAKER_03]: Your system's going to come with one.

34:22.632 --> 34:23.132
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wait.

34:23.733 --> 34:24.213
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

34:24.313 --> 34:25.635
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, why?

34:25.875 --> 34:26.355
[SPEAKER_01]: Why, people?

34:26.455 --> 34:27.877
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you have to spend the money on this?

34:28.769 --> 34:31.350
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, I got another story that's Microsoft related.

34:31.390 --> 34:34.950
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, last week's show we were talking an awful lot about the Nintendo revolution.

34:35.310 --> 34:43.212
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Microsoft has surprisingly come out and kind of professionally congratulated Nintendo on this, well, now don't shake your head just yet, Loki.

34:44.793 --> 34:50.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Xbox VP of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing, Peter Moore,

34:51.114 --> 34:56.355
[SPEAKER_02]: said, quote, I want to give kudos for Nintendo for its attempt at innovation with the new controller.

34:57.816 --> 34:58.436
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot, dot, dot.

34:58.676 --> 35:06.077
[SPEAKER_02]: Bring people in that, as Iwata-san said, are either lapsed gamers or gamers that are intimidated by the complexity of the controller.

35:06.577 --> 35:08.258
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of giving a little pat on the back there.

35:08.278 --> 35:13.019
[SPEAKER_02]: But I hear now rumor is that Microsoft is coming up with their own thing that's going to

35:13.692 --> 35:14.633
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a ColecoVision.

35:41.307 --> 35:44.213
[SPEAKER_02]: And the controller was the greatest thing ever for Mousetrap.

35:44.793 --> 35:48.216
[SPEAKER_02]: My best friend in elementary school had a Coleco.

35:48.797 --> 35:51.339
[SPEAKER_01]: We mean the 9-button thing with the joystick.

35:51.359 --> 35:54.302
[SPEAKER_02]: You had the disc and the little buttons that you would hit at the top.

35:54.322 --> 35:55.683
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we used to have one of those.

35:55.703 --> 35:57.004
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a piece of crap.

35:57.665 --> 36:01.968
[SPEAKER_03]: The number pad, though, if you're playing on the ColecoVision, the number pad was excellent.

36:02.489 --> 36:06.152
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awesome that he slipped the little sheets in there to tell you which buttons to do what.

36:06.192 --> 36:07.073
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I said, mousetrap.

36:07.153 --> 36:07.834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all about mousetrap.

36:07.854 --> 36:09.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Good idea in theory, but it didn't work.

36:09.255 --> 36:09.956
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, too, work.

36:10.676 --> 36:10.956
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura,

36:35.487 --> 36:41.990
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy will be coming out for the Xbox, and it's GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.

36:42.031 --> 36:43.831
[SPEAKER_02]: That shouldn't be any big surprise.

36:44.332 --> 36:49.935
[SPEAKER_02]: But get this, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Special Edition will be coming out for the PlayStation 2.

36:50.495 --> 36:54.157
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, this would be the version that has the hot coffee taken out of it, of course.

36:54.737 --> 36:56.779
[SPEAKER_02]: and some extra features as well.

36:58.161 --> 37:01.644
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't know exactly what the special is that's going to be there.

37:01.664 --> 37:06.369
[SPEAKER_01]: No, what it is, the special edition is their stupid documentary that they're filming about the lowrider.

37:06.389 --> 37:07.750
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I thought that was a separate thing.

37:07.930 --> 37:09.272
[SPEAKER_01]: Nope, that's the special edition.

37:09.312 --> 37:12.675
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bundled with it and that's the DVD for it.

37:12.715 --> 37:13.316
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I get it.

37:13.556 --> 37:16.119
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's also the PSP version they're going to release as well.

37:16.139 --> 37:17.420
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I had two separate stories for that.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.521
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, what else have you got for us tonight

37:35.140 --> 37:40.822
[SPEAKER_03]: The game that I have been highly anticipating myself is the Final Fantasy 7 Dirge of Cerberus.

37:41.743 --> 37:49.306
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have to say, I don't go, ooh, bishona, bishies, blah, blah, blah, because I think that's kind of retarded.

37:49.866 --> 37:54.628
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do have my fangirlism for Vincent, because I was like, so cool.

37:54.768 --> 37:56.969
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole dark, brooding type.

37:57.129 --> 37:59.650
[SPEAKER_02]: The one character I never unlocked my first time through Final Fantasy 7.

37:59.730 --> 38:00.190
[SPEAKER_02]: Go figure.

38:00.490 --> 38:01.170
[SPEAKER_02]: I totally missed him.

38:02.091 --> 38:03.171
[SPEAKER_02]: I never opened that damn safe.

38:04.551 --> 38:07.352
[SPEAKER_03]: Go in the door and talk to him in the coffin, and I got it right the first time.

38:07.752 --> 38:10.673
[SPEAKER_03]: Without the manual, so it meant to be.

38:11.253 --> 38:15.754
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, we have updates on Dirge of Sebris as far as the gameplay.

38:16.455 --> 38:19.936
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, we've seen movie files where it shows it to be sort of a first person.

38:20.296 --> 38:25.057
[SPEAKER_03]: However, it's actually behind the shoulder third person where you can switch to a first person view.

38:25.377 --> 38:27.758
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of like Resident Evil 4 a little bit?

38:28.198 --> 38:35.381
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually, IGN, an article I read on IGN does refer to Resident Evil 4 in comparison to the aiming mode.

38:36.501 --> 38:41.943
[SPEAKER_03]: However, you switch between melee and three different types of guns.

38:43.092 --> 38:47.756
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're saying it's kind of a disjointed way to play the game, but then again, it's not complete.

38:48.576 --> 38:53.821
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing right now is that, for anyone else who's been keeping up with it, the beta was delayed from September 1st.

38:53.941 --> 39:02.608
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the beta is starting, which is what I think is excellent, focusing toward the PlayOnline members who signed up to participate, so of course it's only in Japan.

39:04.889 --> 39:08.572
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is actually going into effect starting...

39:11.134 --> 39:16.417
[SPEAKER_03]: From the date of this, I'm seeing it actually was going into effect on the 22nd, so they are already in progress.

39:17.417 --> 39:20.819
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's shipped to beta testing kits to the PlayOnline members.

39:22.219 --> 39:22.520
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.

39:22.640 --> 39:26.261
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's looking pretty... I've also got a trailer.

39:27.102 --> 39:28.062
[SPEAKER_03]: I found the link to it now.

39:28.082 --> 39:28.863
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems pretty big.

39:28.903 --> 39:32.524
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't watched it yet, because I actually just found it tonight before the show.

39:33.485 --> 39:35.946
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to give that a watch and see what happens.

39:36.727 --> 39:38.929
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of trailers, I have to interject this here real quick.

39:39.610 --> 39:43.393
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if either of you guys saw it, but I saw the trailer from Tokyo Game Show.

39:43.433 --> 39:46.015
[SPEAKER_02]: Some guy filmed this on a camera for Gran Turismo 5.

39:47.774 --> 39:49.576
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my gosh, did that game look sexy.

39:50.016 --> 39:55.381
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just realistic to the T. I mean, and I know we say that with every system that comes out.

39:55.501 --> 39:56.622
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the graphics are so realistic.

39:56.642 --> 39:57.603
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, the graphics are so realistic.

39:57.844 --> 39:58.684
[SPEAKER_02]: But seriously, guys.

39:59.245 --> 40:00.546
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, this time.

40:00.586 --> 40:01.167
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously.

40:01.647 --> 40:02.168
[SPEAKER_01]: Realistic.

40:02.348 --> 40:03.929
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything next-gen looks that way.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.532
[SPEAKER_01]: Project Gotham Racing, I mean...

40:07.461 --> 40:07.881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.

40:08.461 --> 40:11.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Gran Turismo always pushes the boundaries with graphics.

40:12.023 --> 40:15.584
[SPEAKER_02]: They always really just run away with it, graphically wise.

40:15.764 --> 40:16.945
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is no different.

40:17.025 --> 40:17.645
[SPEAKER_02]: This really isn't.

40:17.705 --> 40:18.926
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks superb.

40:19.206 --> 40:22.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you imagine now, Loki, burnout looking like this on a next-gen system?

40:22.427 --> 40:24.148
[SPEAKER_01]: It is coming out in March.

40:24.348 --> 40:25.388
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's going to be so hot.

40:25.969 --> 40:28.049
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already got my eyes set on it.

40:28.610 --> 40:29.370
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of time.

40:29.390 --> 40:34.212
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have a lapse in burnout here with Project Gotham Racing coming in.

40:35.156 --> 40:37.998
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually trying to pick up three or four games that launch for the 360.

40:38.418 --> 40:39.039
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.

40:39.539 --> 40:47.924
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm eyeing up Gears of War, but still to be determined because they haven't announced a price for it yet, which means it can move.

40:49.525 --> 40:54.468
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also Project Gotham Racing 3, and then some other one, probably like an RPG.

40:55.469 --> 40:56.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back over to Dark Sakura.

40:57.570 --> 40:59.892
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to poke around in our...

41:00.945 --> 41:01.385
[SPEAKER_03]: Mailbox.

41:01.625 --> 41:09.748
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we can't forget the listeners who email us every week at our email address, togo, T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.

41:10.288 --> 41:14.169
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura reads and responds to you, some of them on air.

41:14.609 --> 41:15.969
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wrote us this week, DarkSakura?

41:16.069 --> 41:17.650
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to give a nod toward...

41:19.430 --> 41:23.433
[SPEAKER_03]: I got an email from a guy named Deacon Deakman.

41:23.793 --> 41:24.613
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was pretty cool.

41:24.693 --> 41:26.634
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, he's one of those guys on the forums from Australia.

41:26.914 --> 41:39.321
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and he actually also informed about trying to get the PSP 2.0 firmware and the security flaw about the photos and the DS.

41:39.361 --> 41:40.341
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought that was cool.

41:40.361 --> 41:41.882
[SPEAKER_03]: He's also keeping track of it.

41:42.711 --> 41:49.459
[SPEAKER_02]: He also made a brand new set of emote icons for our forums that are all, I hate to say it, Jamie, but they're all Katamari Damacy related.

41:49.599 --> 41:50.020
[SPEAKER_02]: That's fine.

41:50.060 --> 41:50.921
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're cute!

41:51.101 --> 41:51.962
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so cute!

41:52.402 --> 41:53.383
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's awesome.

41:53.484 --> 41:55.766
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to put them up as soon as we figure out how.

41:56.087 --> 42:02.254
[SPEAKER_03]: We also got an email from Alv who just says, Ragnarok, Pekos, heal please, yay.

42:03.802 --> 42:07.924
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that would, that just amused me because I was like, oh yeah, it's someone who plays.

42:07.944 --> 42:15.528
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was that 5% I was referencing last week when I said 5% of our listeners will understand the Ragnarok jokes.

42:16.129 --> 42:16.909
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, cute.

42:17.429 --> 42:19.811
[SPEAKER_03]: Also got an email from Q in Singapore.

42:20.651 --> 42:22.412
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I'm spelling that right, pronouncing it right.

42:23.052 --> 42:26.714
[SPEAKER_03]: Just says that Buzz Orange Lounge Radio wanted to know about the songs.

42:26.734 --> 42:30.636
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually emailed back stating, you know, about Orange Lounge and Tawosuke and...

42:32.097 --> 42:33.738
[SPEAKER_03]: for to get the Beatmania CDs.

42:34.018 --> 42:35.598
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that worldwide thing I was talking about.

42:35.638 --> 42:38.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for emailing us and letting us know that we have listeners worldwide.

42:39.160 --> 42:45.602
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a good email from Mike D who's actually on 1up.com.

42:46.402 --> 42:50.724
[SPEAKER_03]: He wrote a pretty interesting blog about people reading user and licensing.

42:51.344 --> 42:53.285
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently there's some funny stuff thrown in there.

42:54.725 --> 43:01.068
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to go ahead, it says a people scammed into downloading spyware by sneaking it into the licensing agreement.

43:01.428 --> 43:06.770
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is that legally, once you click that I agree, you are signing a contract.

43:07.090 --> 43:09.491
[SPEAKER_03]: And I even remember in my business law classes,

43:10.271 --> 43:13.534
[SPEAKER_03]: They even went into that where that is a legally binding document.

43:23.727 --> 43:24.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Aircraft Navigation or Communication Systems

43:49.125 --> 43:57.752
[SPEAKER_03]: Air Traffic Control Systems, Life Support Machines, or other equipment in which the failure or the software could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.

43:57.952 --> 43:58.312
[SPEAKER_01]: Duh.

43:58.652 --> 43:59.853
[SPEAKER_03]: That's part of the licensing agreement.

43:59.893 --> 44:00.714
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's hilarious.

44:00.734 --> 44:01.374
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Windows?

44:01.415 --> 44:08.840
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they could sneak in there, you know, if you use this program and someone calls you a big weenie for using it, don't blame us, you know.

44:09.561 --> 44:13.724
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's, you know, people really should stop and read those licensing agreements.

44:13.744 --> 44:14.965
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we have a link to the article?

44:16.006 --> 44:39.906
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, it's minime283.oneup.com Okay, so some dude's blog on OneUp, okay Yeah, but, you know, major kudos to them for poisoning I think that's a very interesting thing Because I've even seen jokes snuck into licensing agreements Where it didn't affect the legality of the document one bit But it was, I've seen them done with humor Cool

44:41.553 --> 44:44.497
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually is a very, very, very valid point.

44:46.059 --> 44:48.402
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, again, we got one.

44:48.442 --> 44:55.571
[SPEAKER_03]: I just wanted you to make sure that we give our nods to people from Danzik who listed about the DS Wi-Fi that Loki just touched on.

44:56.972 --> 44:59.613
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'd just like to thank our listeners.

44:59.633 --> 45:07.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep sending them in to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com And we can't always read every email on the air because we just get a lot of them, but Jamie does read them all.

45:08.654 --> 45:19.576
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, and I reply to almost all of them, although honestly I'm at work, so I may not... If I seem a little distracted sometimes in my reply... And let me reiterate that.

45:19.636 --> 45:22.897
[SPEAKER_02]: When you send an email to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com, Jamie does read them.

45:24.063 --> 45:28.469
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, which I found incredibly hilarious for one of the other emails I received.

45:28.489 --> 45:29.990
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, one of the ones we don't read on the air.

45:30.791 --> 45:31.092
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

45:31.212 --> 45:31.772
[SPEAKER_02]: We get it all.

45:32.954 --> 45:43.586
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that we get, and I almost always reply to it unless it's just something like, oh my god, and then I'm just like, deleted.

45:44.775 --> 45:47.136
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well thank you guys who take out the time to email us.

45:48.096 --> 45:49.876
[SPEAKER_02]: And waste part of Jamie's work day.

45:49.956 --> 45:50.697
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate that.

45:50.757 --> 45:52.437
[SPEAKER_02]: No, waste it for a good cause.

45:52.717 --> 45:54.678
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it definitely makes my day go faster.

45:54.718 --> 45:56.678
[SPEAKER_02]: 2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, once again.

45:57.098 --> 45:58.979
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, we have other email addresses this week.

45:58.999 --> 46:01.740
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a full email because we've got our giveaway.

46:02.020 --> 46:05.621
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't forget, we're giving away DDR Extreme 2 and Max 2 VRares.

46:06.081 --> 46:08.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

46:08.282 --> 46:08.762
[SPEAKER_02]: Free stuff.

46:08.962 --> 46:09.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Just send an email.

46:10.162 --> 46:10.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing else required.

46:11.042 --> 46:12.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Just say, hi, I want to win.

46:12.163 --> 46:12.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you want to put.

46:12.843 --> 46:13.043
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

46:13.223 --> 46:15.224
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't sell your email to anybody.

46:15.244 --> 46:15.925
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not cool.

46:16.365 --> 46:17.186
[SPEAKER_02]: No strings attached.

46:17.786 --> 46:19.928
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is the in the groove we're giving away.

46:20.128 --> 46:20.768
[SPEAKER_02]: Your haiku.

46:20.888 --> 46:23.730
[SPEAKER_02]: Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables.

46:24.291 --> 46:25.932
[SPEAKER_02]: Haiku at OrangeLaunchRadio.com

46:26.482 --> 46:27.944
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a couple stories left tonight.

46:28.524 --> 46:37.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Myst V is coming out, and they are calling this the final chapter in the PC adventure game saga coming out from Ubisoft.

46:37.835 --> 46:38.936
[SPEAKER_02]: I say, yeah, right.

46:39.036 --> 46:44.182
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as these games continue to sell, which I don't know how well Myst IV sold, but I don't think it was nearly as good as the first couple.

46:44.763 --> 46:44.863
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

46:45.956 --> 46:48.658
[SPEAKER_02]: There will always be Myst games or other types.

46:49.999 --> 46:53.441
[SPEAKER_02]: $50 or $49.99 will be how much Myst 5 will set you back.

46:54.381 --> 46:57.964
[SPEAKER_02]: And Myst 5 coming out end of January is what they're looking at.

46:58.764 --> 47:05.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Also a limited edition coming out that includes a retrospective on DVD made by Turner Broadcasting.

47:05.848 --> 47:06.349
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of a

47:07.270 --> 47:08.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Well produced documentary.

47:08.371 --> 47:10.934
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it'll be $60 if you want that version.

47:11.194 --> 47:11.795
[SPEAKER_02]: Myst fans.

47:12.176 --> 47:13.537
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Myst was a pretty cool game.

47:14.038 --> 47:16.581
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of those series that maybe... I actually have it on Saturn somewhere.

47:16.881 --> 47:18.844
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's one of those games that maybe jumped the shark a little bit.

47:19.204 --> 47:22.588
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always... Didn't Myst come out around the same time as The Seventh Guest?

47:22.848 --> 47:23.269
[SPEAKER_02]: You remember that?

47:23.349 --> 47:24.791
[SPEAKER_02]: It was very kind of similar in a way.

47:25.031 --> 47:27.052
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember another game that was out at that time that I liked.

47:27.412 --> 47:28.292
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantasmagoria.

47:28.552 --> 47:29.873
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, heck yeah, Phantasmagoria.

47:29.893 --> 47:31.073
[SPEAKER_03]: We need a new Phantasmagoria.

47:31.393 --> 47:34.654
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think Roberta Williams is associated with Sierra anymore.

47:34.814 --> 47:35.114
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

47:35.254 --> 47:37.395
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, Phantasmagoria, heck yeah.

47:38.676 --> 47:40.056
[SPEAKER_02]: Seventh Guest, heck yeah, missed.

47:40.236 --> 47:41.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, sure, why not?

47:41.296 --> 47:42.437
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I liked Loom.

47:43.377 --> 47:46.498
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other one.

47:47.038 --> 47:49.699
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Loki, close us out tonight.

47:49.719 --> 47:51.240
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the last stories you got for us tonight?

47:51.300 --> 47:54.081
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one is, for some reason, unbeknownst to me...

47:55.453 --> 47:59.356
[SPEAKER_01]: Joanna Dark from Perfect Dark Zero is on the cover of 4Him Magazine.

47:59.977 --> 48:03.159
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this maybe a response to the Playboy thing?

48:03.580 --> 48:04.901
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, by the way, I still need to pick up.

48:05.621 --> 48:07.943
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise I will not let you guys down.

48:08.063 --> 48:09.444
[SPEAKER_01]: I will pick up the magazine.

48:10.305 --> 48:11.386
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.

48:12.147 --> 48:13.588
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah.

48:13.968 --> 48:19.633
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, finally, we see all those mods that shrink stuff down, make stuff portable.

48:19.833 --> 48:22.375
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we want to take something small and make it big.

48:23.752 --> 48:30.580
[SPEAKER_01]: G4 did it with their Nintendo controller, but I think this guy won up them by making the Nintendo Game Man.

48:31.421 --> 48:37.709
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Game Man is actually a 100-pound version of the Game Boy.

48:37.749 --> 48:37.849
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 6...

48:38.690 --> 48:40.771
[SPEAKER_01]: and a half times the scale of the Game Boy.

48:40.831 --> 48:43.473
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the Game Boy's been out for like, what, 15 years now?

48:43.513 --> 48:45.714
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's had plenty of time to go through puberty and all that.

48:45.734 --> 48:47.115
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's matured into a man now.

48:47.155 --> 48:50.737
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's over three feet tall and weighs just over 100 pounds.

48:51.417 --> 48:58.802
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cartridges, he actually made cartridges for it with Kirby's Dream Land, Pokemon Red, Super Mario Land, and Tetris.

48:59.182 --> 49:02.203
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all very playable and they're eight pound cartridges.

49:02.884 --> 49:08.207
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually plug it in and they've got pictures on his website of him actually playing the game.

49:08.447 --> 49:14.670
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura and I are sitting back here and we can't help but think of Now you're a man Man, man, man Anyway, forget it

49:39.008 --> 49:39.468
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad joke.

49:39.488 --> 49:41.549
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you guys got that, I hope you did.

49:42.109 --> 49:46.251
[SPEAKER_01]: But it should be noted, though, that the page here, it says copyright 2002.

49:46.472 --> 49:47.692
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is actually three years old.

49:48.092 --> 49:48.853
[SPEAKER_02]: This is an old thing.

49:48.893 --> 49:49.833
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you just find this?

49:49.873 --> 49:51.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it just on a blog lately or something?

49:51.934 --> 49:52.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

49:52.835 --> 49:53.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

49:53.275 --> 49:53.615
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.

49:54.075 --> 49:54.375
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

49:54.395 --> 49:55.096
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fine.

49:55.256 --> 49:56.256
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they going to make now?

49:56.316 --> 49:57.397
[SPEAKER_03]: The Game Man SP?

49:59.598 --> 50:00.098
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

50:00.318 --> 50:00.678
[SPEAKER_01]: Shush.

50:02.859 --> 50:04.100
[SPEAKER_03]: What, geriatric game?

50:05.002 --> 50:09.877
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, it's just interesting I would like to see them make a 6.5 scale DS

50:12.639 --> 50:13.219
[SPEAKER_03]: That'd be cool.

50:13.359 --> 50:16.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just, you have to rub your whole body on it to get anything going.

50:16.560 --> 50:18.080
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to just wipe it with your hands.

50:18.340 --> 50:23.221
[SPEAKER_01]: I completely forgot one last thing I gotta mention because this was just funny that I saw this.

50:23.842 --> 50:27.683
[SPEAKER_01]: For the DS, someone actually made a homebrew game called Tickle Girl.

50:28.263 --> 50:29.223
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no.

50:29.363 --> 50:33.104
[SPEAKER_01]: And you gotta see the screen, or the box art that they made for it.

50:33.164 --> 50:34.184
[SPEAKER_01]: It was quite hilarious.

50:34.404 --> 50:37.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it what we think a game called Tickle Girl for the DS would be?

50:38.845 --> 50:47.090
[SPEAKER_01]: It says Tickle Girl version 1.0 and it says basically it's a multimedia experience where you interact with a virtual vixen via the touchscreen.

50:47.130 --> 50:50.152
[SPEAKER_01]: Tickle different areas of your dream girl to watch her reaction.

50:50.232 --> 50:53.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Utilizes full motion video, sampled audio, and looping background music.

50:53.714 --> 51:01.959
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't we feel the magic XXXY had something similar to this though because there was modes where you could kind of touch the girl and if you tried to touch her in a naughty place she'd jump back and get mad at you.

51:03.529 --> 51:05.430
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody just took this idea in one update.

51:05.450 --> 51:08.512
[SPEAKER_01]: They also mentioned that it's as if you feel the magic, you'll love this.

51:08.653 --> 51:16.118
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can run homebrew stuff on your DS, you can download it at ndsupdates.com.

51:16.799 --> 51:17.279
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

51:18.060 --> 51:18.780
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow, all right.

51:20.322 --> 51:21.683
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of the show, guys.

51:21.823 --> 51:22.543
[SPEAKER_02]: Final thoughts.

51:23.284 --> 51:31.470
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is I have to go grocery shopping, and there's no better time to go grocery shopping than one in the morning on a weekend.

51:32.010 --> 51:32.411
[SPEAKER_02]: Good times.

51:33.298 --> 51:35.440
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to buy something.

51:35.520 --> 51:40.343
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure what it is, but I have this urge to buy something, and so I'm thinking it's going to be something game-related.

51:40.543 --> 51:41.184
[SPEAKER_01]: Buy me a car.

51:41.984 --> 51:42.084
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

51:43.726 --> 51:44.326
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

51:45.047 --> 51:46.648
[SPEAKER_03]: Reject sexism in video games.
