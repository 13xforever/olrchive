272210	276551	Say hello to the happiest bunny on the farm, Miss Dark Sakura.
277771	279472	I like almond butter and cinnamon bread.
280572	281152	It's good stuff.
281232	282452	You just made me think of Cinnabon.
282772	283593	Oh, damn.
283633	285333	I'm hungry for Cinnabon right now.
285593	287293	I found really good cinnamon bread.
288474	290494	And I need an Ethernet cable, please.
290973	292934	You know why Cinnabon pisses me off, though?
293855	295536	Because it smells like crack?
295897	307145	Yeah, well, because they have one in the mall, and it's like, right fucking by EB Games, so every time I want to go shopping for games, I go, ooh, Cinnamini.
308846	309566	So fuck Cinnabon.
309867	311288	Oh, hi, Loki's here, too.
312769	313709	The tech master, Loki.
313890	315491	Yes, I'm here, and...
316500	319002	I destroy Twinbee with Optimus Prime.
319722	321403	We've got to talk about this game later on.
321443	322404	That game was the shit.
324285	326567	Well, we'll talk about some various stuff tonight.
326947	330069	Of course, we've got a little bit of Bomani news to talk about.
331014	333175	I don't know if it's so much a little bit, but the V-Rare's out.
334135	340518	We were going to play it for you guys tonight, except I couldn't get my hands on it, and I'm going to tell you about what happened there, because it's kind of a funny story.
340538	341218	We'll tell you about that.
341658	344679	Loki's supposed to be getting a copy of it from inside Konami.
345000	348541	And also Ultramix 3's V-Rare, which we'll have first, hopefully.
348681	349061	Hopefully.
349141	349501	Hopefully.
349741	350482	The guy better hurry up.
351042	352723	Daniel's got to hurry up.
353083	353483	Hopefully.
355834	356014	Bugged!
379091	381373	I had to finish cracking out on Burnout Legends there
409898	411379	Neuropa, because I like Neuropa.
411399	411779	They're cool.
412099	413800	Gee, weren't we listening to Neuropa last night?
413820	414280	Yes, we were.
414300	417122	So we're going to hear them right now with Standing Still in Time.

838491	839151	Just kidding.
839591	840632	Orange Lounge Radio.
840692	842313	Crap-free Bavani Radio.
844173	846154	Hey kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
846935	849136	Episode number 155 here in progress.
849216	850036	Yes, that's right.
850615	852275	We are actually live tonight.
852315	853596	I'm so freaking excited.
854016	855576	We were off for a couple weeks there.
855796	857176	One week was our choice.
857277	859177	We were gone for a week because, hey, you know what?
859197	860817	We deserve a vacation once in a while.
861337	866319	And actually, secretly, some things are going on behind the scenes, including Jamie's bachelorette party.
866499	869419	It happened to be the same night, but that was cool because I got to go.
869979	872580	I was the only guy at Jamie's bachelorette party, but it was fun.
872920	873560	I had a good time.
874500	875461	That's because you're special.
875661	877061	And I saw Xanadu for the first time.
877802	882545	No, you need to sit down and watch Xanadu all the way through from beginning to end, because that movie is awesome.
882585	883486	Bring earplugs.
884786	886247	No, I like the music in Xanadu.
886267	889029	That actually was one of the only things that made it worth it.
889970	897114	The interesting thing about Xanadu, and I know a lot of you guys probably only know Xanadu from that song that was in DDR3rdMix.
898735	900637	Wait, I'm trying to play a clip here.
900657	900937	There we go.
906041	908302	This is the first song a lot of people played in DDR.
909762	911863	Because it starts with an X. An X is always better.
912684	913724	No, because it's a one-footer.
914404	916285	The Olivia Project, queen of the one-footers.
916945	919686	Anyway, so Xanadu is like this old-ass movie.
919786	920447	Well, not that old.
920627	924368	I mean, I was alive when it was made, so it can't be that old.
924388	924368	1980.
924648	927849	That movie is 25 years old.
928350	928630	Wow.
928650	929530	It had Gene Kelly in it.
929750	934852	Yeah, so what it was trying to do is trying to be like a throwback to old cinema where they would, you know,
935353	935653	The Mews
954955	957616	See, I'll show you how much I was paying attention to Santa too.
957656	960497	It's because you came in and did you see the animated part?
960678	961038	Yes, I did.
961238	962178	I love the animated part.
962638	969541	It's Don Bluth Studios and Don Bluth, to give it a video game connection, did Dragon's Lair, Space Days.
969782	972703	Same guy who did that stuff and Dragon's Lair is awesome.
973063	973343	Yeah.
973543	984148	Even though Dragon's Lair was a ridiculously simple and kind of like as a game itself it was kind of stupid, like the interactive cartoon feature of it made it so worth it.
984648	986650	The technology at the time was pretty nifty.
986690	987431	It was kick-ass.
987891	990813	Well, hell, I can sit here and pay a quarter to control a laser disc.
990853	991674	That's Rudy Brad.
992795	993436	Well, think about it.
993696	999921	We never got a perfect copy of Dragon's Lair at home until DVD players.
1001182	1004765	Or if you are into the emulation scene, the Daphne emulator.
1005226	1005866	Okay, true.
1006006	1010911	But I should say a blessed copy of it.
1010931	1011311	Novellma.
1012498	1015999	I'm not, oh, Scooby, no.
1016079	1018079	He says Scooby, I think Buffy, so.
1019860	1020000	No.
1021820	1021940	Anyway.
1021960	1022801	We're the wrong shirt, then.
1024701	1026882	So, okay, so we were off two weeks ago because of that.
1026922	1028642	We had the bachelorette party going on.
1029042	1032663	And then, which, by the way, was one of the more girly things I'd seen in a while.
1032923	1039985	And, you know, being the gay guy, I got to, you know, got the first look, or got the inside look at what girls really do when they get together.
1040470	1041071	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1061577	1064839	I keep mishearing that as Dalzeem from like Street Fighter.
1064859	1065860	I'm like, here's a Dalzeem.
1066160	1066600	Yoga.
1066800	1067140	Yoga.
1067321	1068021	Yoga fire.
1070262	1070983	Death by yoga.
1074105	1074785	Yoga flame.
1075706	1078807	Anyway, last week we were all here.
1078847	1080748	We had a shitload of people in studio too.
1080809	1087613	We had Mikulatov was here, Pixie Dust was here, the Orange Lounge Madam, who hadn't been here in like a year and a half, and her...
1088663	1091105	Fiance now or a long time boyfriend, one of the two.
1091165	1098150	No, no, Stylin was here and Mel B was here and we couldn't do a show because... And we were drinking.
1098330	1099211	And we were drinking.
1099371	1101133	We were quite intoxicated last week.
1101513	1102514	I had three Guinnesses.
1103094	1113282	And Live 365, due to some error after their maintenance window, they do regular maintenance on Saturday nights now, but they did some stupid error afterwards that caused...
1114002	1127134	Nobody on live 365 to be able to carry a live show, which pissed some people off royally because there's some stations out there that run live all the time, which, you know, one day in a more perfect world, I would like to be able to have Orange Lounge live all the time.
1127915	1129976	We'll see, you know, something we can look at for 2006.
1132158	1135421	But you kind of piss some people off that they did that.
1135581	1139485	So needless to say, a lot of listeners complain, a lot of broadcasters complain.
1139909	1143475	Live 365 will be very careful about those sorts of things in the future, so we'll see.
1144336	1144577	Anyway.
1146940	1149364	So now we're here this week after two weeks of no show.
1149384	1154052	Those of you guys that are members of our LiveJournal community, though, you did get a show last week, so that's all I can say about that.
1155027	1161853	I know we have some people listening for the first time tonight because of our podcast has still been going.
1161873	1170059	You know, we did a podcast last week, even though we were slightly intoxicated, which I don't think we really advertised on the podcast that we were drunk when we were doing it, or at least a little buzzed.
1171921	1179807	At the beginning, I think we mentioned it, but we didn't really like, we weren't quite vocal about it as we usually are on the live show when we have three hours.
1182358	1183739	Something like that was basically the thing.
1184039	1187040	But we were quite intoxicated doing the show, but I have to hand it to us.
1187100	1192562	And listening to the playback of the show, we did a pretty good job, considering how much we'd all had to drink.
1194202	1196323	I was laying down in the chair with a beer in my hand.
1196523	1197863	You left halfway through, too.
1198083	1198604	I had to.
1198804	1199944	You guys just let Mel B talk.
1199984	1201004	He sounded pretty damn sober.
1201064	1201925	Mel B was sober.
1202085	1203985	Okay, that would be why he didn't sound that drunk.
1205766	1206166	So, anyway.
1209645	1215027	So we did the podcast, and we have new people listening tonight because we have the podcast.
1215387	1223930	And I know a lot of folks are saying that they're actually loading up their Live 365 stream in iTunes, especially now because you know iTunes 5 is out and all that stuff, so iTunes is very cool.
1224430	1226751	Don't get me wrong, iTunes is a great program, I use it myself.
1226871	1235154	However, I just want to warn you guys that Orange Sounds Radio is presented in what's called MP3 Pro, and iTunes does not support
1237895	1239316	I think Media Player supports it now.
1239356	1239736	I think so.
1264580	1267563	Anyway, if you want more information on MP3 Pro, you can visit our website.
1267703	1270926	It's at orangehonestradio.com and check the FAQ.
1271246	1279313	Now, I don't want to discourage you guys from listening in iTunes because we will sound normal through iTunes except we sound a little better with the MP3 Pro codec.
1279353	1286840	It's broadband radio at a dial-up connection because MP3 Pro does something to the header or something where it encodes... It adds 10 years of maturity.
1287360	1288281	Basically, yeah.
1288401	1289362	So, anyway.
1290686	1292887	Although I did download iTunes 5, it's kind of cool.
1293147	1300390	The only thing I didn't understand about iTunes 5 is that it really wasn't that much different from 4.9, except for they changed the store a lot.
1300570	1301030	And the look.
1301970	1307893	A little bit, but the look and feel, it's not like they changed the colors or they changed the way the buttons look or anything.
1307913	1310514	They just kind of changed, well now it's more square instead of rounded.
1311414	1313075	But I mean, it's cool and all.
1313795	1317376	Don't get me wrong, I like iTunes, and iTunes 5 is cool and all, I guess.
1317396	1321197	And it does the Outlook sync, I guess, which is cool if you're into using Outlook, which I don't.
1322317	1322937	Outlook sync?
1323758	1326899	It syncs your contacts on your iPod with Microsoft Outlook.
1327219	1329259	Oh.
1329479	1331800	If that's something that appeals to you, you could go do that.
1332440	1332680	Anyway.
1334301	1335141	I use Pine.
1335161	1337282	I use Pine.
1338482	1339262	For your email?
1339703	1341003	Pine and Gmail, that's my two...
1342880	1343724	That's pretty hardcore.
1344749	1344789	Um...
1346065	1349247	Listeners in the chat room, blah, blah, blah, listening to some comments here.
1349327	1351868	LIA365 needs to support AAC.
1352589	1357992	You're not the first person to suggest that, and some folks have actually suggested that to LIA365 directly.
1358892	1361554	I think that would be kind of cool because I think AAC has better encryption.
1361574	1365356	You know what else has really good encryption is OGG, and I'd like to see LIA365 support it.
1365376	1366296	Encryption or compression?
1366456	1366877	Compression.
1366897	1367457	What am I saying?
1367477	1368978	Someone just said OGG.
1369398	1370298	Someone just said OGG?
1370679	1371139	Oh, there it is.
1371319	1371499	Yeah.
1371999	1372400	OGG.
1372420	1373020	Okay.
1374102	1378104	And there has been talk amongst, you know, are we going to stay with Live 365?
1378144	1379225	Are we not going to stay with Live 365?
1379705	1386248	The problem, well, I guess I should say, Live 365, up until last week, has actually been pretty damn good.
1386608	1387709	Can't complain a whole lot.
1388149	1389669	They've got nice people running it, too.
1389950	1393711	Despite the fact we've gone to their awards ceremony two years in a row and didn't win crap.
1394051	1394872	And had to pay.
1394892	1395552	Yeah, and had to pay.
1395772	1396773	We had a pretty decent time.
1396993	1399034	Betty's really nice, and she's like, you know, kind of... I win crap.
1399879	1400420	Oh yeah, that's right.
1400460	1403882	We won the remote control a couple years ago.
1403902	1406504	Yeah, and I won speakers by playing bingo.
1406524	1407365	Did you actually get them?
1407765	1408005	Yeah.
1408225	1408565	Cool.
1409206	1411187	I walked out with that Humongoid box, remember?
1411267	1412228	Oh, that's right.
1412328	1417972	You actually got to take the speakers because you had come in from a long ways out of town, whereas the other folks had to have it shipped to them.
1418092	1423997	And the speakers are now hooked up to my PC, where they were probably on display at GameStop on Fulton and Marconi.
1424617	1425498	Right on, right on.
1426398	1428540	So, anyway...
1430435	1459021	Life 365 pays the licensing for songs that we play and although we've kind of had discussions on staff whereas you know is the video game music really it's kind of in a gray area you know I don't think we really need to pay licensing on it we don't really know we do play a lot of other music in our pre-show on Tuesday night show on the cage match that is ASCAP BMI all that stuff licensed and so Life 365 pays our licensing fees for that so we're all legit we're legal we're
1459656	1460156	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1489702	1490743	So we've been listening to you guys.
1491023	1495187	We've thought about the switch up too, but those are kind of the reasons why we hesitate a little bit.
1497168	1497429	Anyway.
1498830	1503674	And now there's a whole lot of other suggestions there in the chat room, which is kind of cool.
1504174	1505135	Let's go back to mods.
1505976	1506596	What kind of mods?
1507157	1508898	Oh, like MOD format?
1509438	1512421	Dude, there used to be some kickass stuff in MOD format.
1512461	1514603	You can't stream that stuff.
1514783	1514863	No.
1515624	1515784	No.
1517076	1518457	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1545489	1556637	congratulations dot dot dot yeah I got married it was pretty cool um yeah nothing's really different um but uh
1559227	1560647	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1582958	1587220	But it's still 2DX in full arcade mode widescreen on a 50-inch TV.
1587260	1587640	It was hot.
1588420	1590261	That was like hoo-hoo in those red couches.
1590561	1592442	I enjoy playing 2DX on my 30-inch widescreen.
1592462	1593922	50-inch was very nice.
1594262	1595663	Yeah.
1597303	1601145	And, you know, I've played, you know, it's more been a little bit of this and that.
1601165	1604186	I've just been really busy between getting married and going to school.
1604886	1606547	Haven't had too much time for much else.
1607727	1609408	And that, and I think I have a sinus infection.
1610950	1611751	What shitty timing.
1612131	1612892	Oh yeah, seriously.
1613192	1616275	Especially since I'm, you know, busy all the time now.
1616955	1617896	And it's going to get worse.
1618737	1621119	Because two more classes come up in October.
1621740	1624762	And I'm going to be back to doing homework all the time.
1627505	1628906	At least I can take my puppies to work.
1629947	1633930	I go out on break and feed my puppies during my break at work.
1634371	1634631	Addict.
1635912	1637954	So, you know, so I don't want them to run away.
1638803	1648186	I'm saving it for the, trying to get the, what was it, 5 million saved up so I can buy the house, the Japanese style house in my game.
1648326	1649386	I think it's just 5,000.
1649426	1649386	5,000?
1649666	1651366	5 million's a little hard to come by in my game.
1651626	1652867	Alright, well, then I'm halfway there.
1653867	1654247	Very cool.
1656748	1657228	So, yeah.
1658208	1658588	That's it?
1659509	1664550	Well, not really, well, yeah, there's a, what I'm doing, uh,
1666031	1669052	I don't know if people were listening.
1669072	1676254	We got a pretty decent tune in for it, but on the first, I did the premiere, not the first, why am I saying the first?
1677094	1680455	A few weeks ago, I did the premiere for the Blood and Synth album on Pump Up the Volume.
1680875	1682175	That had a pretty good reaction.
1686497	1693499	I've been trying to do what I can to play some of that on my station, on my show.
1693639	1695079	Helping promote the indie labels.
1695399	1695619	Yep.
1696059	1696680	Doing our part.
1696900	1698821	Because that's also part of what we do.
1698981	1702223	We try to get the new and the neat out there.
1703404	1707407	But I really haven't had too much free time otherwise.
1708367	1708928	Working on it!
1709808	1711569	Alright, well I hope you get some free time pretty soon.
1712290	1714231	Oh, I've also been working on stuff for a shaft too.
1715399	1716060	Ah, the tournament!
1716160	1718182	Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.
1718242	1722927	Tentative date around November 17th when the DDR Xbox releases.
1722987	1725910	Or for some of us on staff, Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.
1726631	1726871	Yeah.
1728433	1732156	There's that, but we're working on a GameStop sponsorship right now.
1732296	1732657	Very cool.
1734679	1737882	And we might have sponsorship from the Big K, too, right?
1738082	1738543	So we'll see.
1739741	1741082	So more details coming on that.
1741123	1744466	So DER tournaments not dead yet because we're going to throw a hell of a party.
1744586	1744847	Why?
1744927	1750072	Because we're the ones planning it here at Orange Lounge Radio with some help from our buddies in Sacramento.
1750152	1750793	And bowling.
1751482	1752483	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1777833	1780295	and we got up there and did Afranova in costume.
1780315	1781075	That was pretty rad.
1783817	1787360	And then there was... Somebody was Devil Zuken.
1787380	1787960	I remember that.
1788420	1788660	Yeah.
1789201	1796346	We had... That was actually one of our... One of the old GameStop... Golfland regulars.
1799368	1805832	And then we had the Twinkie one where we had the Beatmania contest with it too.
1807737	1817918	and this year it's going to be DDR and Bowling very cool you know right now there's a whole lot of In The Groove tournaments going on because they're doing like a national thing for In The Groove
1819242	1823206	and various, I have to be honest, I haven't read up on it because I don't think they're doing one here in Sacramento.
1823246	1825408	I think they're going to do one at Miggle for kind of like NorCal.
1825568	1831293	From what I understand, there's actually been, it's officially by, what's the point called now?
1831953	1832554	Paradise Island?
1832574	1833114	Paradise Island.
1833595	1838039	I think that they have put a stop on any In The Groove tournaments until...
1838439	1844981	That's what we heard, something about Sacramento locally, and I wish Explicit was here because he'd know more of the details on what's going on because he works there at Paradise Island.
1845862	1855465	Apparently what went on is that folks are using the old fish and wire trick where they put the fish, not that I'm telling you how to get free credits, don't do this or we'll come find you and beat you up.
1856045	1856545	www.DarkSakura.com
1878114	1879735	We don't want to know about what you beat off at home.
1879755	1882917	My cabinet, duh.
1885959	1887300	I gotta play Miss World Nude.
1887340	1888241	Gotta, gotta, gotta.
1889421	1893424	I have the luxury of being able to map coin buttons to any of the buttons on the thing.
1894845	1901589	We've got our coin thing hooked up on ours, so we just hit the player one button continuously because it's on free play.
1902128	1909831	Anyway, so don't steal credits because then the arcade operators don't make money and then they decide to get rid of their DDR machines and then you wonder why DDR is dying.
1910571	1911711	Oh, I did play something else.
1911911	1912112	What?
1912532	1913452	Arcade P.O.P.O.
1914452	1914873	on the name.
1916493	1916893	There you go.
1917153	1918154	Yeah, I did play something else.
1918174	1918494	Something fun.
1919294	1920494	All right, Loki, how was your week?
1920515	1920915	How was your day?
1922335	1927517	Well, I think, I can't remember, I think the last time we had a show was before the whole
1928188	1957072	GameCompanies came out to our work and that was fun because I got to meet with everybody and I got to talk to the guy Xeroff at Konami and we found out things and he's hooking me up with stuff supposedly the VRares but he's been busy because he has to travel around and stuff to talk to other distributors and companies about their games and he just didn't get a chance to send it yet but soon he promised me he'll send it so
1958188	1958868	I have to wait for that.
1959389	1967994	And then the Tomo guy, who, um, they're the company that's behind the Agetech products, so, um, he's gonna send me some stuff, hopefully.
1969215	1974198	And, um, we just, you know, EA, Microsoft, Ubisoft, just everybody.
1974318	1978961	We saw all their lineup and everything, it's fucking awesome, and got to find out about the Xbox 360, and...
1981342	1982023	All that fun stuff.
1982063	1983585	So anyways, we did that.
1983805	1988770	I got lots of free games, which I then sold to GameStop to put towards my 360.
1989470	1991172	So I now have $250 towards my 360.
1992633	1996898	And then also, what else?
1997118	1998139	Oh, well, let's see.
1998880	2002743	Yesterday, relatives came up and hung out with them.
2002803	2004005	They barbecued for me.
2004685	2004825	And...
2009239	2017842	I found an ISO for Burnout Legends, so I've been playing that on my PSP because it's awesome.
2018482	2022083	Just the kill time until I get Burnout Revenge, which is coming out next Wednesday.
2022703	2025504	And, yeah, I can't wait for that.
2025524	2028585	I already have it paid for, it's reserved, I just have to go pick it up.
2030266	2031146	Lots of fun stuff.
2031806	2033667	And, yeah, that's pretty much it.
2036048	2036348	All right.
2037318	2040060	Neil, would you care to share with us how your week and your day has been?
2040740	2042801	Well, remember we saw the strangest thing at Fry's yesterday?
2043102	2044062	Looking through the DS games?
2044983	2045763	Yeah, what the hell?
2045823	2048325	Fry's is carrying import DS games now?
2049065	2049986	Might just be the Bay Area.
2050526	2052468	Yeah, well, I think probably just that one.
2053008	2054469	But very interesting.
2054509	2057231	But they're not carrying anything super special.
2057491	2062594	They had an import pool game, like Billiards Pool, and an import Mahjong game.
2063274	2063635	That's it.
2064895	2065836	That's all we saw, at least.
2066109	2066989	At least that's all we found.
2067050	2070271	But no import copies of Nintendogs or games have been out here yet.
2070291	2073353	Yeah, because like the Game Boy Advance, there's no region coding on them.
2073653	2079596	Which is interesting that a major retailer such as Fry's, which I know is only on the West Coast mostly.
2081177	2082237	They're sneaking out to the East.
2082337	2082718	Are they now?
2082838	2085719	They're in Georgia, Illinois, and Indiana now.
2085919	2089961	Well, Outpost.com too is the national site for Fry's.
2090021	2092843	So they're carrying at least that one store.
2093894	2095015	Some import DS games.
2095215	2096356	Fremont for those in the Bay Area.
2098018	2098638	What have I been playing?
2098658	2100179	I've been playing, well, guess what?
2100219	2100860	Burnout 3.
2102261	2105524	And yes, I'm also looking forward to Burnout 4.
2107085	2110628	I guess I'm going to go put Flat Out, sell back Flat Out and put that down on it.
2111008	2113170	Because I did not like Flat Out.
2114031	2119696	Compared to Burnout, it sucked.
2119996	2122158	Diablo 2, and I've been playing drinking games.
2123708	2126269	Is Diablo 2 still really popular on the internet?
2126449	2127209	Apparently so.
2127269	2129630	The servers are still pretty damn full.
2130930	2132311	Diablo 2 is like 10 years old.
2133831	2135232	It came out in 2000.
2135272	2135572	2005 years old.
2135592	2137092	That's still a long life for a computer game.
2137112	2138673	They just put out a patch for it last month.
2138893	2139233	Wow.
2139653	2140133	It's up to 1.11.
2140173	2142414	And are people still playing it?
2142734	2145895	I played Diablo 2 for like a month and I just suck at it.
2147295	2148556	I just keep making more characters.
2148936	2152357	I'm trying to come up with more creative names like Itchy, Scratchy,
2153361	2160507	Bernie, and other nicely descriptive ones, Deadly, stuff like that.
2161187	2171034	And as for the drinking game, it's been going around all the breweries and getting a full sampler and seeing which of their beers really suck, and sliding them back and forth until somebody says, oh, fuck it, and just drinks it.
2171295	2172756	Best brewery you've been to?
2174117	2174837	Sudwork, by far.
2175338	2175818	Sudworks.
2176246	2176586	Subwork.
2177226	2178327	No S, just Subwork.
2178687	2179067	Subwork.
2179988	2181929	Now, is that just because it's the local one near you?
2182129	2184290	That's because it's the one I can stumble to, yeah.
2185450	2188492	All I have to do is be able to stumble back across train tracks, and I'm set.
2189032	2189292	All right.
2190133	2195315	But other than that, Gordon Biersch down in the Bay Area, and Pyramid Brewery, which is kind of a national...
2195991	2199513	But this week I went to BJ's, which is kind of a pizza and a brewery place.
2200033	2201394	Isn't that like a chain of restaurants?
2201494	2201954	It's a chain.
2202154	2203394	It's a national chain.
2203454	2204175	They just built one.
2204975	2206916	They've built two here in Northern California now, I think.
2206936	2208457	The one in San Jose does not have a brewery.
2209017	2209277	Okay.
2209397	2210838	There's one in Folsom.
2211498	2211878	Is there now?
2211998	2212178	Yeah.
2212659	2213359	They just built one up there.
2213479	2214319	Oh, it wasn't on their website.
2214339	2215180	And there's one in Roseville.
2215320	2216640	Yeah, I went to the one in Roseville.
2216740	2216961	Okay.
2217101	2220682	And then I went out to Lincoln to Beerman's and it was all bad.
2220862	2222403	It didn't have enough taste to be real beer.
2224339	2225919	It's pretty bad, I'm turning into a beer connoisseur.
2227800	2228900	Last night was beer night.
2229940	2231320	Oh yeah, I did forget to mention that.
2232721	2236982	Last night was our friend wedding reception at Dave & Buster's.
2237602	2238962	So I did actually play more games last night.
2239602	2241482	Where I went through 50 ounces of beer in 10 minutes.
2242002	2245103	I went through 50 ounces of beer in several segments.
2246063	2247403	I had Guinness and a Black & Tan.
2247523	2249084	And played Battletech.
2251852	2252512	You know what I found?
2252612	2257015	The eight-player, what is that, Daytona USA?
2257355	2258095	They don't have drink holders.
2258115	2259496	You can't drink and drive.
2260516	2260917	Damn it.
2261537	2261997	It sucks.
2262037	2265439	Most of the other driving games do have cup holders so you can put down your giant beer and drive.
2265859	2268100	You know what's sad about that Daytona setup, though?
2268941	2277805	I played the first one when it was completely brand new, debuted in Vegas when I was in 11th grade, which was in 90... A while ago.
2278706	2278926	...two.
2280393	2280693	Wow.
2281774	2282074	I know.
2282915	2284996	No, you couldn't have been in 11th grade in 92.
2285376	2286397	I graduated in 94.
2286437	2287298	Holy crap.
2287318	2287958	You're older than us.
2288999	2289899	Well, I'm 29.
2290320	2294883	I graduated junior high in 92, but I guess that makes sense because I would have started 9th grade in 92.
2295023	2296624	Hey, amazingly enough, I did too.
2298545	2301687	Just for those who don't know, I've known Bugs since like 7th grade.
2302008	2302948	I almost said 4th grade.
2302988	2303369	I don't know why.
2303389	2303889	7th grade.
2303949	2306771	And I ran into somebody at Dave & Buster's last night that I met in
2307435	2309936	I have a friend of mine who I just talked to last night.
2309976	2312416	Well, finish your guys' story, then I'll do my side note.
2313236	2317417	We were looking at your picture and laughing.
2317537	2317697	Shut up.
2337011	2337791	We need to scan that.
2337811	2345495	I'm sorry for interjecting again, but the other game I played was, uh, Midnight, uh, was, uh, Langan Midnight, um, Maximum Tune.
2345915	2347035	And I kicked Dan's ass.
2347075	2347676	It was great.
2348896	2351297	Isn't he a really big Initial D fan, too?
2351317	2351657	Yeah.
2351757	2353158	That's quite an accomplishment.
2353218	2362682	He picked an Evo 8 with the, with the, uh, the MR, with the 6th speed transmission, and I did the MR in automatic just because I hate having to deal with it, and I still won.
2363522	2364023	Okay, I'm done.
2364423	2364603	Sorry.
2366467	2370910	I had 6,667 coupons on my card last night at one point.
2371550	2374452	Jeez, I only got 1,900.
2375333	2377935	I've bought very few things from the little Dave & Buster's redemption store.
2378155	2379836	And I still haven't gone through those pixie sticks.
2379996	2387101	For those of you guys who have never been to Dave & Buster's before, it's like Chuck E. Cheese or like an arcade with pizza type thing.
2387241	2389163	Chuck E. Cheese, an arcade, pizza, and a bar.
2389812	2390774	Yeah, but for adults.
2391175	2393000	And they kick kids out at some point, right?
2393020	2393842	Like after 10 o'clock?
2395285	2396889	At any time, they have to be accompanied by an adult.
2397130	2397350	Right.
2398112	2399075	And they usually aren't, which...
2399795	2402996	Although oftentimes they are, that's why you're not tripping over kids all the time.
2403056	2410017	Yeah, which is nice, because you don't have little kids running around screaming so much, and little kids in there thinking they own the place and stuff, because their parents have to be with them.
2410217	2415478	Well, just think, little kids plus big drunken people don't really mix well, because big drunken people can punt little kids.
2415638	2420679	But it's so nice that you can be there and game with other adults.
2421099	2426240	And although it's kind of cheesy, because half their games are ticket games, just like a normal arcade, but they're so much fun.
2426480	2429021	They had a pachinko type one, but they got rid of that.
2429181	2432003	And they got rid of the other one because it broke to the point they couldn't fix it.
2432043	2434265	Yeah, the golden temple one.
2434285	2435766	The one where you push all the money off.
2435866	2438689	However... Did they have the flaming finger still?
2438769	2439709	Yes, flaming finger still.
2439809	2442091	I won flaming finger jackpot, first try.
2443612	2447556	Flaming finger is this game that you control with your finger on like this giant touch board.
2447576	2449297	The countdown speeds up the further you get up there.
2449317	2449977	Yeah, it does, it does.
2450178	2453120	You have to move your finger through the maze as fast as you can to win the jackpot.
2453803	2454983	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2478635	2481676	but they have Exceed 2, Pump It Up Exceed 2 over at Dave Buster's.
2481696	2482716	That doesn't make it any better.
2483317	2484497	No, it's cool.
2484717	2486678	I'm actually starting to like Pump It Up.
2487418	2489319	Damn him for making me like Pump It Up.
2489619	2501483	But between the home release, which I'll talk about after the break, the home release and this recent arcade release, as much as I still hate Pump's interface, I'm really starting to like Pump a lot more, which is kind of scary.
2502664	2503604	Are you really Rob?
2503864	2505225	I know, I don't know what happened.
2505245	2506285	I think it's a pod, Rob.
2507082	2511943	Rob did show me earlier, though, another reason why The Groove sucks, and I thank him for that.
2513383	2514563	All right, we were playing.
2515324	2520865	Loki brought over some games tonight, or should I say he just brought over his PS2 hard drive, which is loaded with games.
2521285	2528766	And I'm looking at his list of games, and you know how when you load a game onto the HD loader, for those of you guys that have seen it, you can write in whatever the game is called.
2529266	2533227	Well, he wrote in, in The Groove, parentheses, this game sucks.
2534090	2536111	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Drew, Carameldansen
2564210	2571228	So we played Torn, and that's the one that goes, you know, I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor.
2571268	2573313	That's how the lyrics go, but they did...
2573993	2577056	I'm cold and I am shamed, lying on the floor.
2594926	2595867	InTheGroove Mormon Edition
2619926	2620927	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
2647721	2649883	That's exactly what they're doing in this game.
2649903	2651484	They're cutting out the salt.
2651524	2653546	I can imagine the Loki would be just the movies.
2653786	2661792	The first time I saw that movie was off of a pirated copy from the Oscars that they gave the Oscars panel to watch.
2663073	2666115	Which is how I had it on VHS about six months early.
2666255	2674181	The first time I saw that movie was on HBO and it was such a bad movie we couldn't get up to turn it off because we had no will to live anymore.
2674862	2676003	And so we decided that we were like,
2677130	2678952	Somebody get up and stop it, please!
2678972	2681033	The end was pretty cool, with the boat.
2681414	2686838	Yeah, the only reason I like this movie is because Leonardo DiCaprio died.
2687459	2688820	And he died a horrible death.
2688840	2690601	You know what, you can see his thumb break off.
2691602	2696666	When she's letting go, and he's falling into the water, his thumb is still attached to the piece of driftwood.
2697207	2698047	Well, that's cool.
2698127	2698928	That was really cool.
2701710	2703392	I still have, as I said, I haven't seen it, and...
2704388	2705588	I already know how the movie's going to end.
2705608	2706428	Why would I want to see it?
2706468	2707529	The boat fucking sinks!
2708669	2710869	How can you make a three-hour movie about something you already know of?
2711729	2713770	Well, then there's like JFK, Nixon.
2713970	2718211	And I know people who worked on it.
2718291	2721831	DiCaprio dies, the boat sinks, the old lady had the jewel the whole time.
2721911	2724272	There, I just saved you three hours of pain.
2724572	2726632	You can thank me via email.
2726772	2729953	The ending of The Passion of the Christ totally came at me as a surprise.
2731296	2734177	I did not expect... You know what?
2734397	2736057	I really liked the book a lot better.
2738698	2741199	Wasn't Passion of the Crest where they break out in song and dance at the end?
2741739	2743439	Or am I thinking of a Mel Brooks movie again?
2743860	2744380	I think you are.
2744420	2745480	By the way, I have a dilemma.
2747701	2747941	What?
2748201	2748801	Jesus Christ.
2749481	2749941	November.
2750621	2750821	Yes.
2750941	2752742	Depeche Mode concert or Bill Ingvall?
2754022	2754802	Depeche Mode.
2755263	2755743	All the way.
2756143	2756583	All the way.
2757183	2759144	I'm still debating because I don't like concerts.
2759404	2760224	Bill Ingvall's
2761121	2761901	Not that funny to me.
2761921	2762522	Yes, he is.
2763462	2764682	Then again, where am I from?
2764842	2771305	Alabama, so they actually watch Blue Collar Comedy Tour or whatever down there, I guess, but not in my house.
2772605	2774086	Bill Engvall is funny.
2774106	2775787	Have you listened to any of his stuff all the way through?
2775807	2779008	I actually had to watch one of the episodes of that show once.
2779188	2780328	They all do a little stand-up in it.
2780648	2785190	I'm going to bring over my friend Julie's DVD, and you're going to watch it with me.
2787051	2787611	That's even better.
2788231	2790372	It's Stephen Lynch's releasing a new album.
2791178	2791578	or Echo Image.
2823267	2824209	We're coming back.
2824329	2825130	We're under a new label.
2825150	2827996	We're really working on that album that will never ever come out.
2831602	2831923	Anyway.
2834764	2838767	Gosh, we've been going off on so many tangents tonight, and I had so many things I wanted to say, but I forgot, but that's alright.
2839167	2841188	Oh, I guess I should talk about my week and my day.
2841248	2844530	I've actually been on vacation from work all this week, which is so nice.
2844590	2846071	I haven't had to do shit at all.
2846151	2849293	I haven't done a single goddamn thing, except I got my hair cut one day, which is kind of cool.
2849633	2855197	Which sucks, because I have to go back to work tomorrow, and I'm not looking forward to having to catch up to a week's worth of email, but, you know, I'll live.
2856878	2862101	And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI while I was here.
2863482	2863742	Loki...
2864309	2867212	Everybody got their promivians done yesterday.
2867232	2867532	Son of a bitch!
2867552	2868213	The mic's not on.
2870415	2871276	Fucking asshole!
2871456	2872116	Son of a bitch!
2872157	2872697	Okay, listen.
2873478	2875920	Why the hell does everybody... Okay, how much do you want of it?
2875960	2877441	Does everyone have their AF done?
2877482	2879003	Because they sure as hell won't help me with mine.
2879023	2879283	No, I don't.
2879343	2879604	I don't.
2879664	2880124	I'm only level 53.
2880164	2881705	I don't have my AF done.
2882686	2883127	Fucking AF.
2883147	2887491	I only have, like... I have the boots, which are completely useless for a black mage, and...
2888018	2889639	I don't have any of my Permovians done.
2889659	2893621	I don't even know why I have the chains of Permothia or whatever it is.
2893841	2896402	Because I can't, I don't go to any of those places.
2897763	2899344	We're all experts at those Permovians now.
2899364	2900945	We can run you through them like this.
2901105	2903646	I need, I've been trying to get back in and play.
2903706	2907168	It's just I have too many things I'm trying to do at the same time.
2907228	2908408	It's for the best, honestly.
2908929	2911770	Because I probably won't be playing much Final Fantasy XI after this week because I won't have time.
2912691	2915252	Oh, I don't have time, but I'm buying World of Warcraft.
2916778	2920019	Well, at least one of us needs to be reporting on that game, so, fine.
2920039	2926002	Because World of Warcraft is this really big and popular game, and none of us are playing it, so.
2926082	2934505	Well, at least they actually have some really cool system or game that's within the game, you know, sort of like a capture the flag type thing, but we have Ballista!
2934866	2935586	Woo!
2935626	2936326	Ballista!
2937087	2937747	That was crap.
2939528	2940208	Beats Blitzball.
2941108	2941688	That's true.
2941849	2945090	I will take the Blitzball, or I'll take the Ballista minigame over...
2945894	2947215	That fucking card game in 8.
2947255	2949917	Yeah, thank God Tetra Master isn't in the game.
2950717	2951438	No, Tetra Master was 9.
2951738	2952638	It was a different card game in 8.
2952839	2954119	It was pretty much the same thing though, wasn't it?
2954340	2955640	I never touched the card game, you know?
2955660	2957321	The card game can suck my balls.
2957502	2958322	I hated the card game.
2958342	2958922	I never played it.
2960123	2962705	But you feel like you have to or you're going to miss out on items.
2963946	2964946	I didn't feel like I had to.
2965447	2966627	I didn't care about missing out on items.
2966667	2967588	It's just how I play the game.
2967608	2970730	I got halfway through the third disc before I was like, screw it.
2970830	2972811	I watched somebody else beat the game and I never touched it again.
2974693	2974953	Okay.
2975865	2977146	Loki's Birthday Today
3005666	3006708	Happy birthday, Loki!
3007911	3008272	Yay!
3008532	3010737	So how old are you now?
3010757	3010737	25.
3010877	3011719	Oh, a quarter century old.
3011759	3013182	Now how did you celebrate your birthday today?
3013757	3015498	I went to Olive Garden and had lunch.
3015858	3016339	And that was it.
3016479	3016739	Yummy.
3017400	3023924	Well, since I was too cheap to get you a present today, I decided to leak Final Fantasy VII Advent Children on the internet for you.
3024384	3026586	So enjoy, because I know you really wanted that.
3026786	3029508	Yeah, there's been a lot of people doing the same type of thing for me.
3029948	3035872	For example, somebody leaked Burnout Legends on the internet, so I got to play that and Advent Children on the internet.
3035992	3038714	And what else was there that they leaked on the internet that I downloaded?
3040095	3041056	Some other stuff, I'm sure.
3042356	3043097	Burnout Legends was me.
3044486	3045006	Oh, well, thank you.
3045026	3045627	I appreciate it.
3047168	3051690	And, um, yeah, there's... I know there was one other thing that they did.
3053331	3058475	You know a DS game that everybody has been just going off about and just loving and adoring?
3058575	3063878	I need to pick this up because everybody is just wanting to make sweet love to this game and they're doing it in the chat room right now.
3064458	3065339	Advance Wars DS.
3065999	3069401	I've heard lots of great things about this game, but I need to pick it up at some point.
3071122	3071883	They have a site.
3072003	3073944	You can make paper Advance Wars characters.
3074977	3076197	That's cheesy, but cute.
3076377	3077037	Very Nintendo.
3077057	3078058	That's a very Nintendo thing to do.
3078818	3079758	Well, Nintendo didn't do it.
3079778	3080298	Some guy did.
3080518	3081378	No, that's even worse.
3081718	3082038	Or whatever.
3082798	3084059	Where can they download this?
3084099	3085239	Wasn't it on Digg.com?
3085339	3086419	Yeah, Digg had a link to it.
3086939	3094260	Digg.com Yeah, it has a link to the... It's like Slashdot, but they pat themselves on the back way too much.
3094600	3094800	Yeah.
3095741	3098721	And the stuff's relevant.
3099201	3100501	And the stuff is sort of relevant.
3101842	3104462	And they're usually... The dupes get put together
3105049	3112054	you don't have to wait days for them let's all profess our love for Slashdot
3113058	3139354	I like Slashlight, it's a good song Anyway, there's low energy in here tonight, I don't know what it is We need diverse systems, more diverse systems We will do a diverse systems break later, I promise you But I had to do this, this break First I had a request for No Doubt Get Loud because of the new iTunes commercial Somebody said I should play that song But we'll get to that song in this break However, there's a song that's more important that I have to get to in this break And it's for Jamie, of course

3604735	3605818	This one's a special dedication.
3631853	3644535	You've got to forever The green grass blows and the wind is dancing It would be a much better sight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
3661458	3663180	So now what should I do?
3663301	3670649	I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you've gone My supplies fell through And they gave me everything you had
3680911	3688673	He craved my happiness when you made me feel joy in me Just smile, but now I feel your stress Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no And who has time for tears?
3688713	3691073	Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love
3716517	3727042	Hi kids, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio here, episode number 155 in progress.
3727062	3728842	Thank you guys so much for tuning in and joining us tonight.
3729203	3731303	I notice we have a lot more listeners than we usually do tonight.
3731323	3744229	I don't know what the heck's going on, if we just are getting more people because of our podcast, or because I actually talked about it in the live journal community, or people are just going through withdrawals because we weren't here for two weeks, or just a combination of all the above, which I'm thinking is partly that.
3744909	3747911	But regardless, thanks for tuning in and wasting your Sunday night with us.
3747971	3748711	We appreciate it.
3749952	3753674	And we're just here talking about what's on our mind.
3753754	3758577	Pop culture things, DDR, Bomani-related things as they come up, and what have you.
3759718	3762159	I want to talk about Nintendo.
3763040	3764100	Nintendo pisses me off.
3765381	3768523	Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total Nintendo fanboy, but...
3769292	3775475	Ever since I bought a widescreen TV, I've come to loathe Nintendo for their lack of support for widescreen and HD formats.
3784060	3789943	I don't know why they're doing that in my opinion, especially as HDTVs become more and more the standard.
3790243	3798166	I realize right now not a lot of people have HDTVs, but if you go shopping for a new TV, they're starting to get priced pretty competitively.
3798226	3808111	The TV I picked up was $600, which granted is quite a bit of money, but not that much more money than what you'd pay for a normal TV of the same size, probably about $200 more.
3810116	3815702	So I think as the technology gets older and older and we start getting into Christmas, I think HDTVs are really going to start taking over.
3816162	3823790	And Nintendo has this absolute lack of support for HDTVs and widescreen.
3824751	3830858	And I kind of realized that as I was trying to find a component cable for my Nintendo GameCube, because as you know, Loki...
3831451	3832171	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3861468	3863869	Well, maybe not that long ago, like a year ago or two years ago.
3864509	3866150	They discontinued production of the component cables.
3866170	3875594	And get this, your GameCube has to have a special port on the back that says digital in and out for you to even be able to use this component cable if you could find one.
3876155	3879396	The new GameCubes they made after mid-2004 don't have this.
3882150	3882991	I'm glad I have an old one.
3883051	3885434	They took a feature away from the new GameCube.
3885454	3887537	They took this digital out port away.
3887877	3888938	And their reason why?
3889339	3891982	They said less than 1% of our users were using it.
3893132	3897074	And I'm thinking, well, okay, because the GameCube is kind of the kiddie system, right?
3897734	3904497	The GameCube is the thing that the kid has in their bedroom so that they can play Pokemon or whatever, right?
3904978	3910820	But the GameCube can also function as a pretty decent gaming system for the rest of us hardcore gamers, right?
3910961	3913382	Like, for instance, Resident Evil 4.
3914634	3916075	F-Zero, Smash Bros.
3916115	3921079	Melee, although it's kind of kiddy-like in its artwork, it's a great freaking game.
3921119	3923080	It's one of my favorite games they put out on GameCube.
3924702	3929705	No support for HD because they say less than 1% are using the HD feature as it is.
3931887	3932487	I don't understand.
3932548	3935290	How much was it just to put that little extra port on the back?
3935310	3936510	I guess maybe this was one of the costs.
3936931	3941134	Maybe this was a way that they made the GameCube cost only $80 was by taking this feature out, but...
3943584	3944665	Did the Famicom have it too?
3944685	3945165	The regular...
3960339	3962160	Bugs trying to say something about the Famicom had it too.
3962460	3963901	Yeah, the Japanese Famicom has it too.
3964001	3964662	Oh, I didn't realize that.
3964702	3968004	See, now the Nintendo America just had red and yellow wires.
3968044	3969164	Right, because that's all we had at the time.
3969184	3972386	We didn't have any sort of connectors to really do it with.
3972727	3982613	So that cable, while I guess that's kind of nice that you can take your Super Nintendo cable and use it on your Nintendo 64 and your GameCube, it hasn't changed in the last 15 years.
3984730	3985371	So, I don't know.
3985391	3987352	I'm a little disappointed in Nintendo's lack of support.
3987733	3991155	And some of the games on GameCube actually support widescreen TVs.
3991215	3992797	I played F-Zero on widescreen.
3993157	3995319	It was sexy as hell, but blurry.
3996080	3998862	Blurry because S-Video is as high as it goes.
4001945	4003065	And, you know, it sucks, too.
4003125	4015168	It's really limiting themselves because they were only, you know, wanting to put out, you know, family games because this whole, you know, they didn't really want to touch on the whole, you know, mature-rated games and stuff back when Mortal Kombat was out there.
4015188	4021029	It's like, oh, we're just going to put out normal games, you know, and make this more kid-friendly system because that's what people were looking for.
4021769	4024170	And now they've kind of missed the bus.
4024490	4028351	And now, you know, this whole, well, there's not going to be, you know, that many...
4029344	4030605	Broadband TVs and stuff.
4030645	4031526	No one owns them right now.
4031646	4035349	Well, yeah, but people are going to be buying them in the future.
4035369	4037130	So what are you going to do with your game system then?
4037210	4044476	I'm having a hard time believing that they're... It seems like they're trying to put out a system that will support what the market wants right now.
4044856	4051361	But no system ever really takes off at launch, except for maybe, I don't know, Super Nintendo maybe did.
4051822	4054043	But PlayStation even took a while to get big.
4054844	4058807	Final Fantasy 7, I'm going to just say this, it might piss some people off.
4059207	4061889	I think Final Fantasy 7 is when the PlayStation really started picking up.
4062210	4069415	When Square announced that they were going to jump ship and go over and start making games for PlayStation, that's when the PlayStation really started selling and you saw a lot more games for it.
4069795	4071957	That in addition to things like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot.
4072497	4074138	But I think that was really the turning point.
4076880	4081584	Even PlayStation 2, their launch titles weren't humongous.
4082404	4083045	Fantavision...
4085006	4087168	So no system ever really takes off.
4087248	4088450	And Xbox launch?
4088590	4089330	Don't make me laugh.
4090852	4101663	And I think one of the only reasons PlayStation 2 had such a huge launch, which was probably one of the bigger ones in recent memory, which still wasn't, it's not like they were... I think it was riding on the success of the PlayStation.
4102163	4105727	Well, that, the fact that it would play the old PlayStation games, and that it was a DVD player.
4105947	4107829	People were buying PlayStation 2s as DVD players.
4108100	4109522	That was actually really true in Japan.
4109962	4118030	But one thing about the DVD player on the PS2 is that it's a piece of crap, and using it as your primary DVD player will shorten the life of the system.
4118231	4119172	I don't believe that one bit.
4119312	4119852	That is true.
4120173	4122675	I used mine as my primary DVD player, never had a problem.
4123156	4124257	You are in the minority then.
4125541	4128524	I've heard of the problems, but I've yet to see it.
4128884	4139613	Dan has told me that just about every return within the first few years of the PS2's release were, basically, they were sliding off the track.
4139693	4140774	It was everything related.
4141234	4145398	Everyone who brought theirs back was because they were using it as a primary DVD player.
4146480	4149582	I've used both my PlayStation 2 and my Xbox as DVD players.
4149622	4152284	I'll tell you right now, the Xbox is a better DVD player, hands down.
4152484	4155026	Oh, yeah, because it's a more intelligently built system.
4155046	4156927	It better be if you've got to pay $20 extra to use it.
4156987	4158148	Yeah, that too.
4158368	4159129	The fact, oh, that.
4159149	4161430	Microsoft can blow me for that.
4161450	4165133	The Xbox itself, though, is a more intelligently constructed piece of equipment.
4166304	4167264	In a way, in a way.
4167584	4168925	It's made of better parts.
4170605	4173446	It's a more stable system.
4174346	4179087	I bet if you drop a PS2 and an Xbox, less of the Xbox will break.
4181028	4181288	Maybe.
4181708	4183389	I love... Because it's so damn heavy.
4184549	4187370	Microsoft is awesome because they...
4190049	4194953	They're like, oh yeah, well this time around, you know, you don't have to pay extra to get your wonderful DVD remote.
4194973	4196334	You can watch DVDs right out of the box.
4196394	4200317	And everyone's like, oh yeah, but you gotta buy your hard drive.
4207502	4212646	Anyways, so yeah, they're sticking it to you in another way now.
4213286	4215988	No route to host.
4216008	4216308	All right.
4217109	4217369	All right.
4220569	4222190	Um, moving on.
4226293	4227314	What was I going to talk about here?
4227854	4232217	A little follow-up to something we were talking about earlier in the program.
4233458	4237361	Talking about those in-the-groove tournaments that are going on around the nation.
4237421	4239883	I said that Milpitas is going to be having one, I think.
4240003	4241083	Well, go figure.
4241464	4244846	The person who's actually helping to put on this tournament is actually listening tonight.
4246182	4251084	and gave me a link to more information on the In The Groove tournament that's going to go on at Milpitas Golf Land.
4251104	4257386	So for those of you guys that happen to be in Northern California, September 24th, 2005 is the date of the tournament.
4258147	4258467	11 a.m.
4258527	4259347	for registration.
4259467	4261848	Ten bucks will get you in the tournament.
4262028	4262908	Ten dollars flat.
4262948	4264369	There's no pre-reg fees, nothing.
4264729	4267650	This is a straight-up perfect attack, expert only.
4268150	4271432	You can find more complete rules over on DDR Freak and their tournament forums.
4272796	4277819	But since it's in the Groove Expert Tournament and I'm too old and too fat, yeah, I will not be entering this tournament.
4277839	4278839	But I might go just to have fun.
4279359	4280760	Just to see people, but we'll see.
4282141	4282681	So check that out.
4284402	4287103	Loki, I will not be attending this tournament.
4288924	4293387	You wouldn't go just to socialize with people?
4294647	4294807	No.
4296308	4296788	Just curious.
4298129	4301891	The only thing I would want a boxer for in the first place
4302495	4305516	is to have a good system to run Step Mania on.
4307476	4309096	That's really all I wanted for Food Mix.
4309316	4310457	Food Mix, the arcade game.
4310957	4313097	Much better use of the boxer than In The Groove.
4313117	4313497	But anyways.
4315638	4321679	Anyway, you can find more information on an In The Groove tournament happening near you on InTheGroove.com.
4321699	4323979	They're doing this big national thingy.
4324159	4329321	Tell them, Red Octane, or not even Red Octane, Rockstar, get a hold of those guys in Japan.
4329341	4330221	They're making good music.
4330581	4331421	I'm telling you, you could...
4331974	4332615	MC Groove's Dance Craze
4357027	4357627	I know, it's horrible.
4358567	4362228	You know what Mad Catz helped put out recently, though, that's actually pretty damn good?
4362668	4363068	Pump It Up.
4363708	4366569	Pump It Up Exceed, home version, kicks ass.
4367189	4369570	I was very surprised, but it kicks a lot of ass.
4369870	4376271	Despite the fact that I still hate the interface, I can't stand the way you go around and you pick your songs, it's better than it used to be.
4377811	4380912	It's about as good as that Pump It Up system's gonna get, the home version.
4382859	4385280	And there's a whole assload of songs in this game.
4385300	4387862	They kind of split up the songs into three channels.
4388222	4392144	You have your Banya channel, and Banya's kind of like the Naoki of Pump It Up.
4392585	4395366	You know, it does a lot of these, just a variety of different types of songs.
4395386	4397948	So there's like 97 songs in the Banya channel, and...
4398648	4399329	4 and the other one?
4399449	4401830	No, it's actually pretty evenly spaced out.
4401870	4402530	I'll give it to him for that.
4402550	4403831	It's about 30 songs apiece.
4404311	4407232	You've got the K-pop station, which is pretty rad.
4407252	4412735	They've got a lot of songs under K-pop, including some songs you might recognize from DDR, such as Starion.
4414676	4415256	What's the other one?
4416197	4416637	Caution?
4418035	4419015	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4443444	4448245	Booby Law, I can't remember the name of the song, I just know it's the booby song because it's the video that has just the chick with the boobs.
4449105	4452826	Soka Meki Ranran, that one, and Kiss Me is in Exceed 2.
4453126	4456947	So there's a couple songs in the arcade, and then some interesting American exclusives.
4458147	4462648	Crystal Method is in there, and Elvis has a song in there.
4462748	4467889	That one Australian band with the crazy video, I can't remember the name of the song.
4469729	4471550	The song's like, forget it, forget it.
4474744	4476065	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
4502101	4504762	Yeah, but you have to read the arrows a whole different way.
4504802	4506984	It's just a different way of reading them with the colors and everything.
4507024	4508484	So it's a little bit of a challenge at first.
4509705	4518269	And there are some crazy-ass step patterns that shame in the grooves, step patterns even, in regions of difficulty, if that's what you're into.
4518689	4521650	But I think that kind of stuff is retarded, so I don't play that.
4522391	4531035	So I didn't really, just, you know, my friend made me look at a few of the really, really tough step charts, and I just kind of went, stupid, and went back to playing the more fun steps.
4532205	4534006	So I actually really enjoy Pump It Up Exceed.
4534786	4535366	I recommend it.
4535606	4537487	If you guys are into the dance games, pick this up.
4537527	4539608	This will hold you over until the DDR releases.
4539948	4550113	Now granted, the downside is that you have to get a whole new pad with this, so the bundle's going to cost you about $60, but the soft pad that comes with it is actually pretty darn nice.
4551613	4555375	It's a better quality than those Konami soft pads they put out.
4559056	4559477	Pretty nice.
4560237	4560617	I enjoyed it.
4563120	4569162	Dance Dance Revolution Strike Dance Dance Revolution Strike Dance Dance Revolution Strike
4587100	4590701	It's a very strange name, isn't it, for the game.
4590741	4591281	But whatever.
4591721	4600604	Dance Festival Revolution Strike, the I being an exclamation point, will be shown at the Tokyo Game Show 2005, so they say.
4600624	4601064	A couple days.
4601384	4602484	Yeah, a couple days away.
4603405	4608666	It's supposed to have that same interface as Extreme 2 and Dancing Stage Max, of course, overseas in Europe.
4609886	4616068	The website for the game also had a special little page set up talking about the new Naoki song called Passion...
4617985	4619385	I almost thought it was Passion in Love.
4619625	4621946	Passion of Love, Naoki featuring Paula Terry.
4621986	4625787	So you might remember the rumors a while back that Paula Terry was in studio recording something for Naoki.
4626127	4626727	This is what it is.
4627047	4629728	And it's going to be featured in Dance Dance Revolution Strike.
4630308	4640330	No word yet as to whether it's going to be inside EX2 or the European version of Dancing Stage Max as of yet.
4640971	4641351	So we'll see.
4641371	4642571	I'm sure it will be.
4643786	4648709	Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure it will be, too, but nothing's said one way or the other yet.
4649850	4656093	We don't know when this game will actually be coming out, but end of year, early next?
4656874	4656093	2006.
4657114	4658295	2006?
4657994	4658295	Spring.
4660076	4660676	2006 it is, then.
4663998	4664378	All right.
4666059	4666780	We're going to go to a break.
4667120	4669801	When we come back from this break, did your download finish?
4669821	4670482	Almost?
4670542	4670782	Almost.
4671838	4673319	Try me back at about 8.30.
4673579	4675800	Trying a little while?
4675820	4675800	8.30.
4676161	4676441	Alright.
4677081	4677221	Ish.
4678662	4679142	We'll do that.
4679182	4680203	Stupid slow FTP.
4682985	4688168	In this break, Loki wanted me to play something from the disc he brought last week.
4688188	4688448	Yes!
4688828	4689789	Finally!
4690109	4690789	Finally!
4690829	4693711	We picked up the new Diverse System albums.
4694088	4715614	D7, all three CDs of that, D8, and also Dear Mr. Taka, plus some other special stuff like the Chorus K album and the Good Cool Ultra Expander CD, which has the most kickass remix to Absolute, which you might have heard if you downloaded our non-show last week.
4716528	4718789	and lots of good stuff.
4719349	4727353	My personal favorite for D7, and I was waiting ever since I heard the little teaser for it, was the Trip Machine Dark Core mix.
4728773	4729554	Awesome.
4729574	4733035	There's a remix of Ecstasy on there, which is really cool.
4733855	4734976	And a few other things.
4734996	4739538	There's a remix of Love Love Shine, which is interesting.
4740370	4741491	Okay, so what am I going to play here?
4741811	4744554	Okay, I think we should play the Trip Machine Dark Core Mix.
4744614	4744994	Where's that?
4745194	4746576	That's a D7.
4746696	4747497	Oh, you have the wrong CD.
4747977	4748518	Oh, damn it.
4752822	4753102	Uh-oh.
4753902	4754783	This is the one, isn't it?
4754823	4756445	The Dear Mr. Talk and all that stuff?
4756525	4757646	No, but this is my other one.
4757866	4758967	There's a second CD.
4759428	4761189	Put that on your thing over there.
4761249	4761610	Is this it?
4762931	4763051	No.
4763291	4763792	Oh, it's blank.
4764012	4764632	Oh, crap.
4766114	4766294	Okay.
4767330	4768371	I have it around somewhere.
4768411	4769212	I'll keep looking for it.
4769252	4769972	Is there something on that CD?
4770012	4771393	Yeah, we'll find them.
4771573	4772314	See what's on here.
4774276	4776657	Um... Okay.
4778018	4779780	Actually, it might have been in a case for you.
4779940	4781101	I think I put it in a case.
4782642	4783042	Or something.
4784323	4784424	No.
4785765	4786345	No, that's not it.
4787686	4790708	Um... So anyways, we've got some stuff on here.
4791089	4793611	Um... The diverse system stuff.
4793791	4795732	We have Dear Mr. Taka, which is cool.
4796313	4796393	Um...
4798445	4801588	Actually, let's play something from Good Cool Ultra Expander.
4803950	4809194	Let's play the Absolute Ultimate Remix again, because that's good.
4810435	4816320	We're going to play the Absolute Ultimate Remix.
4816400	4819283	It definitely lives up to its name.
4820083	4820984	This is pretty cool.
4821004	4822245	We heard a little bit of this last week.
4822345	4824827	We'll try to find the other CD in the meantime.
4824967	4825608	Alright, we will.
4826963	4830847	We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and your phone calls.
4832829	4833570	Lost sound there for a minute.
4833770	4835832	We will get to your phone calls this next break, we promise.
4835872	4837594	OrangeLoungeRadio.com, click on Interact With Us.
4837694	4840878	So here it is, Good Cool with DJ Taka, Absolute, the ultimate mix.
4856558	4857121	Thanks for watching!
4984314	4985075	Thank you for watching!
5101052	5102533	Alright, we found the other CDs.
5103094	5106277	So we're going to actually play one of the songs from Diverse 7 for you guys.
5106297	5108219	And this is the one that Loki was hyping up here.
5108659	5111402	It's the Trip Machine Dark Core Mix.
5113143	5117047	And we're going to play that, and then we're going to come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.
5119589	5120390	Enjoy this one, you guys.
5121211	5121991	Who's the artist on this?
5123713	5124213	I don't remember.
5124434	5125174	Just Diverse System.
5125234	5125775	Alright, here we go.
5150248	5151129	Thanks for watching!
5229051	5230172	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft
5264059	5264821	Thanks for watching!
5297022	5297843	Thanks for watching!
5319544	5321527	Thanks for watching!
5385851	5388832	Trip Machine, the Dark Core mix here on Orange Launch Radio.
5389493	5392414	So that was some music from the new Diverse Systems 7 album.
5393114	5395275	Not as new as Diverse Systems 8, though, which is also out.
5395976	5396636	So look for those.
5396736	5398677	And Diverse 9, which is coming.
5398977	5399718	Coming very soon.
5400578	5401318	Alrighty, very cool.
5402199	5405000	And some people said they couldn't hear the Trip Machine in that.
5406461	5408042	Our chat room was kind of going, that's Trip Machine?
5408062	5408782	I heard Trip Machine.
5408822	5410863	I don't see how you couldn't have heard it.
5411003	5412984	The synth lines are the same.
5413024	5414885	The synth lines are the same, but...
5415447	5418269	Where's my... Mommy, can you sing Trip Machine?
5418309	5418909	Where was that?
5419089	5419690	Where was that?
5419750	5423252	It was on the Trip Machines, like, drum and bass, and this is, like, Dark Horse, so it's a little different.
5423392	5423932	I liked it.
5423952	5425093	I thought it was cool.
5425493	5426454	But... It was okay.
5427234	5427554	It was okay.
5427574	5429876	I think this is the only way to possibly like Trip Machine.
5429916	5432397	There is an interesting... The normal versions are horrible.
5432717	5442884	There's a blues version of, um... Or, like, kind of like a jazzy blues type version of, um... I want to say, um... Oh, God.
5442904	5442944	Um...
5444620	5447082	Not Make Your Move, but one of the older ones.
5447622	5451185	Not Put Your Faith In Me, Keep On Movin'.
5451846	5452646	That's on one of them, too.
5452666	5453407	We'll have to play that later.
5453447	5454928	It's kind of funny.
5454948	5457190	Does it actually sound like Keep On Movin'?
5457250	5457991	Yeah.
5458111	5462454	And they also have the long version of Made In Innocent, which was in Food Mix 2.
5462935	5466177	Or Food Mix Plus, I want to say.
5467378	5468259	I'm getting confused here.
5468279	5469159	Yeah, Food Mix Plus.
5470721	5471021	Very cool.
5472557	5475017	Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio
5501817	5507724	While we sit there and wait for somebody to call us, because there's not a whole lot of people logged into Skype, so I don't know if we'll even get anything here.
5508404	5510226	I do want to make sure this gets a mention here.
5510266	5511848	This was something that happened while we were gone.
5512869	5517535	GuitarFreaks and DrumManiaV2 on their way out.
5518456	5520438	They do have a website opened up.
5521162	5532752	We link to it from our website over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, but it's konami.jp.am.locationtest, because this is something that's currently location testing, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, V2.
5533112	5546963	And of course, the reason why Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is now V is because they did a little bit of a hardware upgrade on the stuff there when they put out V. They did a little bit of a hardware upgrade, so now they have the full videos and everything.
5547504	5548745	The game's just a little bit prettier.
5549910	5551991	So that's something to be looking forward to.
5552291	5552851	Let's take a call.
5553591	5554552	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

5720020	5720560	Anyway, I don't know.
5721100	5721340	Okay.

5758362	5762884	And then the other song is Take My Hand by Maria Eva with Dreams Wing Kingdom.
5764044	5771726	I remember back when I first started playing Guitar Freaks, you only got one song to pick from from Extra Stage, and you liked it.
5773407	5773627	Sorry.
5774307	5778308	And then the comeback song is Kachaka by Maki de Yayas.

5792957	5801224	I will mention to you the songs for his first album called Shinkyoku, which means The Divine Comedy, which is a poem by Dante.
5801705	5802645	Oh, yeah, I know that one.

5876075	5876435	Oh, God.
5876475	5879976	First I thought you said her Volvo, and I'm like, oh, she's driving along in her Volvo.
5880036	5881937	That's kind of weird that she's driving a Swedish car.
5881957	5883357	It's called a B-U-L-B-U-L.
5883377	5883777	Okay, got it.

5901785	5906589	They're already doing the location test right now.
5907790	5908270	As of now.
5909211	5911012	So, usually what?
5911032	5915896	The location test goes on for about a month, and then they go back for a month or two, and then the game comes out, usually, right?
5916517	5916717	Yeah, so...
5917330	5925756	Oh, I forgot to mention, about Tokyo Game Show, I checked on their website, and they just recently announced Poppin' Music 12 Iroha for the PlayStation 2.
5926456	5927697	Big surprise, not.
5929738	5936863	I mean, honestly, Poppin' Music's been constantly coming out for the PlayStation 2, so that's no surprise at all, but that's good for the Poppin' Music fans, of course.
5937343	5937683	Good news.
5939338	5939638	All right.
5940258	5940778	Sounds cool.
5941019	5943179	Well, now, Tokyo Game Show is happening this week, right?
5943319	5944840	Yeah, like this Thursday.
5945000	5945420	This week.
5945820	5946660	Awesome.
5947040	5954043	So you've got to go, since I can't read the Japanese, you've got to go on some of those sites and look at the news and come back and let us know.
5954063	5954943	You know what else is good?
5955283	5955523	What?
5955903	5957204	Revolution news.
5957384	5959524	They're going to show the controller and everything in Mario 128.
5959564	5961905	So we're going to get a lot of news this week from Tokyo Game Show.
5961945	5962165	Oh, yeah.
5962465	5962885	I'm excited.
5963145	5963405	All right.
5964806	5965166	All right.
5965886	5967687	Yeah, and one more thing.
5967707	5968107	Mm-hmm.
5969825	5971986	It's not Kekak, it's Kekak.
5972267	5972807	Kekak.
5973448	5974248	I like Kekak.
5974869	5978332	No, you have to go to Indonesia, believe me, it's Kekak.
5978852	5983196	I don't doubt that the pronunciation I'm doing is horribly wrong, but, you know, I like Kekak.
5985037	5985718	Alright, Kekak.
5986799	5988280	I said it once correctly just for you.
5988861	5989161	Alright.
5990482	5996787	Yeah, and, you know, just after I go off, just announce to them about the 10th style CS.
5997088	5997368	Uh-huh.
5999980	6002301	Yeah, I already, you know, I already pre-ordered mine.
6002841	6003782	When's the street date for that?
6003822	6005103	Isn't that October?
6005523	6006303	November 17th.
6006323	6007084	November 17th.
6007244	6007444	Yeah.
6007864	6011606	So, don't you remember last year, November was, like, a huge month for Bomani?
6011626	6016188	Because we got, like, Ultramix 2, 8-Style, and Poppin' Music, like, 10, I think it was?
6016328	6017168	All in, like, the same day.
6017188	6023151	I remember, as I mentioned on the non-show, that the new DDRs and the new...
6024492	6027354	Carriker Revolutions are going to have demos for each different version.
6027414	6028274	That's out there now.
6028354	6031056	One of the news sites published that in their review.
6031156	6035678	So that's out there now where everybody knows that you can play demos in one and the other.
6036799	6041061	And I still envy those people at Rhode Island right now because they have Happy Sky.
6041341	6041881	I heard.
6042122	6049025	You know, I was talking to Miklatov over the weekend and he said that he damn near got on a plane to go out there to play it.
6049045	6049966	And I was like, you're crazy.
6049986	6050346	He's like, yeah.
6050366	6053828	Well, if you got your simulators out there, I have all the key sound to BMS files.
6054949	6055469	Happy Sky Lobster
6076574	6078715	Alright, anything else you wanted to share with us tonight, Siggy?
6078735	6079775	Nothing much else.
6080195	6083376	I'll just let you know what news are going to come out.
6083737	6084257	Sounds good.
6085037	6085877	Tokyo Game Show.
6087038	6087778	Alright, sounds good.
6088378	6088598	Yeah.
6089959	6090199	Okay.
6092380	6094740	Right, nothing much else.
6094920	6095761	I guess that's it then.
6095781	6097121	I'm going to go to some new calls, alrighty?
6099002	6099182	Yeah.
6099322	6099882	Yep, okay.

6118251	6119351	DarkSakura is not a fella.
6119652	6120232	Hi, Ron John.
6121113	6121933	Hey, honey, what's up?
6122974	6124636	How you doing?
6124656	6125076	What's on your mind?
6126075	6126395	Not much.
6126415	6127616	I got some information here.
6128516	6135858	I don't know if you guys know this, but it seems that Katamari Damacy 2 or We Love Katamari came out early.
6136839	6137839	It came out early?
6138199	6138399	Nope.
6138479	6138659	Yes.
6140080	6140380	Okay.
6140680	6142360	The guy who works for the game distributor says no.
6143441	6148322	Well, I have a link here to somebody who went to Target and bought it today.
6149723	6149943	Nope.
6150803	6151724	Target broke street.
6151964	6152844	Yeah, they just...
6153530	6155632	That's exactly what I said when I found it earlier.
6155932	6156973	It doesn't come out until the 21st.
6157113	6159255	It got pushed back because they weren't done with it yet.
6159275	6160777	It hasn't even been pressed yet.
6161097	6162938	Wait, but how do they go to Target and get a copy then?
6163179	6163859	Fuck if I know.
6165060	6165501	Interesting.
6165701	6170785	All I know is they really did a really shitty job of making new box art for it.
6170845	6172027	Yeah, the cover art's shit.
6172307	6173328	So okay, give me this link.
6173348	6174048	I want to look at it.
6174409	6174809	Right there.
6175149	6175790	Alright, let's see.
6177688	6179328	Let's see what this is all about right here.
6179368	6182049	Okay, so this link got posted in our chat room.
6182909	6186870	www.orangeloungeradio.com Excuse me.
6187070	6192632	Orangeloungeradio.com slash chat, or I'm sorry, click on the link that says chat.
6193292	6193772	And here it is.
6193812	6201074	Somebody posted, go to Target now, and they've got their little Target bag with the receipt and the little game, We Heart Katamari, Sony Software, $29.99.
6202094	6203055	Interesting.
6204215	6204735	Interesting.
6205245	6206206	I don't know, whatever.
6230067	6233951	I'm hitting up Target.com to see if it was just that store Where's that dude live?
6234031	6234512	Do we know?
6254766	6255367	I don't know.
6255407	6258649	I just found a link early today when I was at my friend's dorm.
6258689	6259570	We were playing video games.
6259590	6260931	Let's find out which Target that is.
6261972	6270658	Just to say something about on the Target website, it says this item will be released on September 22nd and you can pre-order it.
6271078	6271799	Interesting.
6272720	6274101	So it's just this one story.
6274301	6277803	Indianapolis, Indiana it looks like is where this person says they live.
6277883	6282647	So if you are living in the Indianapolis area,
6283348	6289569	Start calling those targets and see if you can't get your cams on the game because somehow they got a copy of it.
6289729	6294450	Or it's a really cleverly done Photoshop, but I don't know why this guy would Photoshop it.
6294470	6299332	No, it could also be like for some whatever reason they got a promo copy and the dumbasses put it out to sell.
6299432	6301092	And that was like the only copy that they had.
6302112	6302872	But you never know.
6302892	6304493	I mean, stupid things like that happen.
6304513	6310554	I noticed that on the receipt here it says the Sony Software...
6311481	6315362	The actual name of the game is in there, like it's a generic code in there or something.
6315402	6318784	But does it have what the disk number is?
6318804	6321164	You know how each disk has an ID number on it?
6321184	6322625	Yeah, it had a little number on it, I think.
6322645	6323245	What's the number then?
6323285	6324646	Hey, there's a number there.
6324746	6325866	Hold on, hold on, let me check.
6326366	6327987	Ah, what a time for my mouse to be dying.
6328627	6331028	If I can understand, somebody in California bought it.
6333729	6335489	Doesn't matter anyways, I have the Japanese version.
6335509	6336750	I mean, what do I care?
6339761	6343118	I was just going to say, I was going to look up here, see if it matches.
6343259	6344264	We live Katamari.
6346485	6349546	Well, that's very interesting if it did come out a little early.
6349626	6353649	Some folks should just consider themselves lucky and maybe the game will be making its way.
6355490	6360732	But as far as we know, no official word from Namco or any gaming site for that matter that the game has come out early.
6360772	6369097	And I would think if the game shipped early, Namco would be shouting it from the mountaintops and all the gaming sites would pick that up because everybody has a boner for Katamari Damashii.
6369157	6373179	Perfect example, look at... Was it Shane?
6373259	6373560	He got...
6375271	6378373	Someone returned Pump It Up to one of the stores and he bought it used.
6378813	6380374	And this was before the game even came out.
6380974	6383095	I mean, so stuff like this happens.
6383155	6392441	I mean, people buy something or get something for free from their distributor or vendor or whatever and they'll return it back to a store and then sell it.
6392741	6403987	Or in this case, they might get a promo copy early because I've had a few copies of stuff early before it's treated and someone goes and sells it or mistakenly puts it out on the shelf
6405011	6405371	Never know.
6405731	6408933	Or whatever the company is, if they're shipping it in one day.
6412534	6415536	Because I remember the same thing happened last year with the PS2 minis.
6415636	6422659	I mean, I found out that Target put it out three weeks early, and then a week later, Best Buy, we put it out the following week.
6424480	6424940	Interesting.
6425260	6427101	Hey, chat room's bringing up an interesting point.
6427121	6429342	Did you say your friend got this in California?
6429362	6429442	Yeah.
6430106	6430967	Mission Viejo San Diego
6448899	6451000	So if you're in the San Diego area, it's Mission Viejo.
6451240	6452701	Look, you can even call the Target.
6453441	6455102	Should we call the Target and ask if it's in stock?
6456063	6456683	I should do that.
6456703	6458644	Someone should link that to me.
6459104	6460545	We could call them right here on Skype.
6460685	6462246	I don't want to call them right now.
6462286	6462846	Are they open?
6463626	6464047	No.
6464067	6465807	Targets don't close until 8 o'clock.
6466688	6469109	Okay, you know what?
6469169	6469950	I want to try calling them.
6470390	6470630	Can we?
6471641	6476463	Okay, we're going to call this target and see if they have Weehawk Heart Katamari in stock, okay?
6476883	6478604	So we've got to let you go in order to do this, okay?
6478824	6481065	Alright, I'm going to call you back later with some other stuff, so later.
6481085	6481806	Alright, later, bye.
6483527	6484027	We're crazy.
6484287	6485988	Okay, you guys don't talk, just let me do the talking.
6486008	6487508	Alright, switching off the microphone.
6487568	6488309	Alright, here we go.
6491410	6495652	I hope to God this is the right number and I don't get some freaking... I don't know, we'll see.
6496493	6499394	Either way, my caller ID's blocked, so that's what's important, right?
6500967	6503509	We're now calling a Target store, printed on the receipt.
6504670	6507613	Mission Viejo, California, see if they have We Heart Katamari and stuff.
6508133	6509334	Damn it, I just picked up another call.
6509354	6510876	Zach, you gotta call us back in a little bit, okay?
6511596	6512317	Alright, later.
6513098	6515340	I'm still new to Skype.
6515420	6515940	Okay, here we go.
6521205	6521946	Calling, calling, calling.
6522026	6522386	Oh, here we go.
6533083	6533884	Three Ringy Dingys.
6539907	6540728	Four Ringy Dingys.
6546712	6547612	Nobody's home at Target.
6551815	6554557	Apparently the other two busy selling advance copies of We Heart Katamari.
6557018	6558259	Live radio, ladies and gentlemen.
6562386	6564047	Someone let Target know their phone's off the hook.
6564187	6565148	One more ring and then we're hanging up.
6570051	6570851	Very interesting.
6571752	6574273	Not only that, but bad customer service.
6575474	6576334	Maybe they're closed.
6576354	6578295	They could close at 8 on Sunday, I guess.
6579016	6579396	No.
6579516	6579936	Interesting.
6581177	6582438	Oh, fuck, they're on to us.
6585380	6585740	Alright.
6586280	6586760	We called.
6586900	6587381	No answer.
6587881	6588321	What can we do?
6588341	6591103	Sigh.
6594954	6599217	I'm looking through this one thread that was linked in the chat room.
6600317	6601198	Are they saying the same thing?
6601438	6608662	Someone actually had a very good challenge where the guy said post a copy of the... Well, he put up a picture of the disc in the manual.
6609142	6609502	One second.
6610383	6610943	Interesting.
6611003	6611763	Well, let's see what happens.
6611783	6618047	Alright, we're going to go to another call real quick here since our brilliant live radio experiment didn't work out very well.
6618547	6620848	Yeah, because really you could... I don't know.
6621088	6622149	Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
6622867	6624248	Yeah, you already know who this is.
6624488	6624969	Hi, Saku.
6624989	6626410	You know, Target's closed, actually.
6626730	6627170	Yeah.
6627210	6627951	I just wanted to share with you.
6627991	6628752	Target's closed.
6628792	6632935	Yeah, you're about almost 20 minutes late right there.
6633836	6641402	Well... Had you known this, like, maybe, you know, 20 minutes earlier or probably 30 minutes earlier, you probably would have got through.
6641682	6645385	Ron Chan, freaking earlier next time.
6646245	6647106	Beyond time next time.
6647126	6647506	No, I'm kidding.
6647546	6647847	It's fine.
6648327	6649228	What's on your mind, Saku?
6650261	6651283	Just calling back.
6651603	6653044	I'm in school right now.
6654025	6656668	Moved back on campus a couple of weeks ago.
6658210	6659071	Congratulations.
6660332	6663335	Yeah, and I still miss playing in the groove in the city.
6664437	6668020	I miss that because I'm like 30 miles of stay from the city, so...
6669304	6670786	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
6683382	6684282	I'm just lazy.
6684662	6686363	What city is this so we can completely avoid it?
6686503	6686983	New York.
6687683	6687863	What?
6688283	6688503	New York?
6688523	6689203	City of New York.
6689264	6690084	City, city, New York?
6690904	6691844	Yeah, the city of New York.
6691984	6694445	I thought they had it in the groove at Chinatown.
6694905	6698346	Yes, not only that, but in Coney Island, Queens, Staten Island.
6698566	6699966	I mean, it's starting to spread like cancer.
6701747	6702827	Interesting analogy.
6703447	6704087	Lovely thought.
6704807	6705108	All right.
6705348	6707948	That and just missing playing 2DX11 Red.
6707988	6709429	I just need that fixed.
6709649	6710889	So it's kind of spreading like New Jersey?
6712188	6715171	No, it's just... It's reddening like your mama's legs!
6715652	6716293	Oh, burn!
6716593	6717975	Nah, New Jersey's just the smell.
6718015	6718675	I was in Philly.
6719857	6720177	Yeah.
6720738	6723441	Anyway, what else is on your mind besides lack of Bomani?
6724472	6727015	I just, you know, all that new shit that just came out.
6727035	6729997	All the new info and whatever.
6730258	6732099	You know, I'm not going to be able to make it to Digital Life.
6732780	6734061	I wanted to come.
6734221	6739386	I tried to schedule my boss, but she had scheduled me for a full week class right there, so I'm not going to be able to do it.
6739926	6740907	But I hope you guys have fun.
6741027	6741548	I tried.
6741648	6743089	I will definitely come next year.
6743970	6744511	I know, man.
6745351	6747093	Well, I just hope it still happens next year.
6747927	6748527	I hope so too.
6748588	6751810	Well, we need somebody on the inside taking some pictures and sending them to us.
6751870	6753351	So, take some pictures over there.
6753631	6754952	I wish I had a digital camera.
6755072	6756313	Are you practicing for your freestyle?
6757273	6758434	Uh, I don't know about that.
6758454	6759335	I need a job first.
6760155	6760255	Oh.
6760555	6761636	I'm still unemployed.
6761876	6762076	Oh.
6763057	6764378	Get your resume on Monster.
6764458	6765298	Nine months now.
6765599	6766719	Get your resume on Monster.
6766940	6767520	And Craigslist.
6767620	6771142	Dude, I've tried that already.
6771162	6771803	Dude!
6771923	6776266	When you've been trying to find work for the past nine months, you kind of realize that it's...
6777213	6781560	There's probably no light at the end of the tunnel.
6781881	6784124	And to make it worse, I don't even get work study this year.
6784565	6784965	You know what?
6785046	6788972	Apply at Target because you'll never have to work past 8 on a Sunday.
6790754	6792676	And you'll always be home in time for Orange Line.
6793517	6795038	I just hope so.
6795078	6798061	I hope they don't make me work on... I don't know about making me work on weekends.
6798081	6800183	I hope I can find a job that revolves around my schedule.
6800343	6803867	Well, there are some employers out there that will work with you if you're in school.
6804287	6806970	It's possible to find, but you are going to have to kind of look at the bottom.
6807293	6811655	And a lot of schools also have temporary services where you can actually work on campus.
6812436	6816238	I've already exhausted those means of working on campus.
6816298	6818699	I mean, the jobs are already filled up.
6819319	6820780	And people want work-study.
6821200	6823461	Find a nice clock tower.
6824322	6824722	Stop.
6824962	6825362	Stop.
6826263	6831225	Yeah, it's really bad for me because I probably waited almost a week to even find out that I didn't have work-study.
6831265	6831305	So...
6836243	6837944	As I said, I'm up at Schitt's Creek right now.
6837964	6841385	I'm just hoping I get some jobs that I applied to.
6842686	6844167	And we'll see what happens from there.
6844347	6845167	Well, good luck to you.
6845827	6847848	I hope that you find something.
6847868	6853171	Just check with the big, big companies like the Targets, the Walmarts, the Toys R Uses and whatever.
6853191	6855432	Alright, man.
6856966	6862950	All right, well, have a good one, Zaku, and good luck on the job hunt, and hope you find those Bomani games, okay?
6864271	6864571	All right.
6865231	6865531	Later.
6866012	6868893	Bye.
6869214	6875718	Okay, now, on the chat room, it sounds like that they actually looked up this target, and the damn store is open.
6876178	6879280	So is there only one target in Mission Viejo, or is there more than one target?
6881437	6885579	See, maybe there's more than one Target in the town, so the one you guys are looking up might not be the right one.
6885599	6887020	But Mission Viejo's not that big, is it?
6887420	6888000	I don't think it is.
6888841	6889201	Don't know.
6890542	6895644	On that one thread, by the way, someone said they worked at Target and got a shipment of it in, so they went ahead and bought us a game.
6896625	6896945	Really?
6897765	6899626	They said they got very few copies in.
6900306	6900747	Interesting.
6900807	6902087	Okay, well, here's the correct number.
6902608	6903948	Did we miss-dial their number?
6903988	6905169	Let me look at what we dialed last time.
6906209	6908871	949... Oh, we totally dialed the wrong number last time.
6908891	6909451	Well, let's try it again.
6912369	6913850	Okay, now we've got the right target number.
6913890	6914431	Thank you, chat room.
6922717	6925179	Thank you for calling the Mission Viejo Target Store.
6925259	6925600	You're welcome.

6954140	6954940	I guess we get the operator.
6959463	6962866	Please stay on the line while your call is transferred to the operator.
6972401	6973161	Good evening, Target.
6973641	6973822	Ms.
6973842	6974562	Mayhill, this is Sue.
6974582	6975482	How can I direct your call?
6975642	6977523	Uh, yes, can I speak to somebody in electronics, please?
6978543	6978743	Sure.
6985406	6985866	Electronics?
6986346	6989367	Uh, yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.
6989507	6991128	It's We Love Katamari.
6992408	6992888	Let me check.
6992908	6993188	Hang on.
6994549	6995089	Yeah, SD?
6995589	6996470	Those are on the next pile.
6996550	6996670	Okay.
6996690	6997310	Appreciate it, man.
6997450	6997650	Thank you.
6999761	7000701	I'm sorry, what was the game again?
7000801	7002642	It's We Love Katamari.
7004563	7005483	Yeah, we have one left.
7005883	7006923	You do have one left in stock.
7007223	7007643	Yes, we do.
7007804	7008744	Okay, great, thank you.
7009884	7010424	Alright, bye-bye.
7012525	7013425	One left, kids!
7013725	7015206	Holy crap!
7015246	7016726	Get down there and pick that shit up.
7016906	7017747	One left in stock.
7018667	7022048	I'll have to talk to my folks at Namco and see what's going on.
7022827	7025428	Go figure, you heard it here first, boys and girls.
7025868	7027909	We gonna rat them out, yo.
7028250	7031631	We freaking called them, and they have one copy left in stock.
7031651	7033112	You go post that on GameTax right now.
7033132	7037554	I think I'm gonna make a stop by Target tomorrow after I get out from the chiropractor.
7038955	7041176	You wanna call the one down up the street here?
7041936	7042276	Alright.
7045598	7049399	Okay, if they have it, I'm gonna give Neil money to get mine now.
7049960	7050300	What, are we gonna...
7050931	7054033	except that I have my non-reserve at GameStop and I can get it for 30% off.
7054053	7056674	Are we going to call them right now?
7056694	7060656	Well, it's 30% off later or full price now.
7060856	7062677	I can't believe we're doing this live on air.
7063878	7065319	I think we'd have better things to talk about.
7066879	7068860	But damn it, we might get our Katamari fix tonight.
7068900	7069601	All right, here's the number.
7069641	7071082	Who has Katamari already?
7071102	7071122	638-4971.
7071142	7072883	All right.
7078427	7081068	Bug's going to call him and in the meantime we're going to go to a break.
7082128	7088090	When we come back from the break we'll let you know what happened and we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match and we've got a couple other Bomani stories for you guys tonight.
7088451	7089971	So we will be back after this.
7090471	7093392	Started off with a little bit of the captain, the good captain here.
7094173	7095073	You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.
7098303	7112545	Dreamer Dreamer Take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer Life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la, la, la
7138783	7140265	Thank you for watching!
7176827	7178609	You've got a dream of your dream
7204366	7205267	Thanks for watching!
7235891	7236111	Thank you.
7299952	7301573	Thank you for watching!
7338102	7339263	Thank you for watching!
7391684	7394404	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
7503317	7508164	From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!
7508504	7508965	Holla!
7509045	7511929	We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
7520202	7520943	and the hunt is on.
7550825	7557949	If you're lucky enough to be in the San Diego, Mission Viejo area, get your ass to Target before 9 o'clock.
7558589	7559730	And you can thank us later.
7561771	7562331	That's great.
7564752	7565132	Alright.
7567073	7568454	You know what's sad?
7569014	7574237	After we cover that on our podcast tonight, that poor store is going to get a shitload of inquiries about the game.
7575858	7576578	Power of the internet.
7576598	7577779	You know what's sad also?
7578919	7579980	I'm going to rat them out.
7580569	7581529	Don't rat him out.
7581790	7582650	Oh yeah, I'm ratting him out.
7582670	7583310	Don't rat him out.
7583370	7584071	I'm ratting him out.
7584091	7587212	Wait until somebody picks up that game, because maybe it'll be good enough to give us an ISO.
7587232	7588172	Well, then they better hurry.
7589213	7590253	I'm going to rat him out.
7591174	7593195	Because, you know, Namco's going to call tomorrow.
7593875	7594615	We'll see what happens.
7595796	7596536	Nah, I don't care.
7597817	7603619	Actually, what's interesting is that... The only reason I'd be pissed off is because we didn't get ours on time.
7604019	7607901	Because, you know, it was supposed to come out, you know, I think last week.
7608779	7609560	and they pushed it back.
7609700	7610760	So, you know what?
7611281	7612341	That's my bitterness.
7617584	7617884	Alright.
7622326	7624628	The chat room's yelling at us here.
7624648	7626509	I don't know if somebody lives in that area or something.
7628410	7628690	We'll see.
7631571	7631972	Where was I?
7632012	7634473	I lost track now because of all this We Heart Katamari madness here.
7636201	7639302	Let me post that link one more time for you guys looking for that Mission Viejo target.
7639602	7639782	Okay.
7641803	7642603	I have a slight update.
7642863	7644023	There's one in the area.
7644644	7647144	They have them, but they aren't putting them out on the shelf until Tuesday.
7647905	7648825	Until Tuesday?
7648925	7649765	Until this Tuesday.
7649845	7650645	Okay, who's doing it?
7650886	7651786	Roseville, the old one.
7652146	7653246	The old Roseville one.
7653706	7654227	Interesting.
7654747	7656407	Because there's like two or three in Roseville now.
7657468	7657888	Huh.
7658528	7659788	So that's the one on Douglas Boulevard.
7659968	7660208	Yep.
7660568	7661209	Interesting.
7661409	7661949	I'm calling the...
7667086	7669268	So it's somehow getting out early to targets.
7669508	7669708	Yeah.
7671249	7674051	Just call the one by my house and they don't... Interesting.
7674912	7675312	Alright.
7676993	7679895	Just give me some calls made in the morning, let me put it that way.
7680195	7687320	You know, the other thought is, is that what if Namco is purposefully leaking this out to produce excitement over the game's release?
7687400	7688401	No, I don't think so.
7688501	7689341	They're not that smart.
7690582	7693324	Actually, I worked for Namco and yes, they've done stuff like this in the past.
7693973	7695216	I don't think so.
7695317	7695698	I doubt it.
7695758	7700370	I think this is just more of an error in someone's shipping department.
7702546	7705468	Now the chat room's going, call my target, call my target.
7705788	7708370	Fuck you, call your own target, seriously.
7708770	7711012	The hell, we're not calling all your damn targets.
7711052	7713393	We are not the goddamn operator.
7713433	7715095	Call your own fucking target.
7715535	7721319	Pick up your phone, dial the little numbers, and ask them yourself, just like we did with six different stores.
7721459	7721879	Thank you.
7723420	7724701	You see how easy it is?
7725161	7725662	I did it.
7726102	7726722	You can do it.
7727563	7729664	The phone is easy to use.
7729705	7731546	You learn how to do this when you're three.
7733868	7734769	Hit the button.
7735209	7737771	If you have that much trouble, get your mommy to call.
7739452	7742755	You shouldn't be getting this game anyways if you have that much trouble dialing a phone.
7743095	7747619	You obviously don't have the hand-eye coordination enough to use the controller to play the game.
7749821	7754364	If you're having trouble using the phone, you've got a serious problem and you probably need help going pee too.
7756106	7758127	Do you need someone to help you do the wipe?
7758848	7759869	Or how about the flush?
7760029	7760289	Alright.
7761485	7765809	We're getting like a million requests for the clip of the phone call.
7767358	7769779	So we'll, I don't know, put it in the live journal community.
7769799	7770099	Please.
7770119	7770539	I don't know.
7771379	7779482	Post it to our forums, please, because my work firewalled live journals, so I can't do that no more.
7780462	7780862	We'll see.
7780902	7781423	Shame on them.
7781503	7782203	We'll see what we can do.
7782703	7792566	Because I have a certain person I would like to send that to that is certain on certain street dates, and I would like to forward that to them, and that would be hilarious.
7795067	7795327	All right.
7796291	7799273	We're going to get into the cage match, but we can't figure out where Loki's song went.
7799293	7800374	Do you have a new song for us?
7801335	7802196	For my cage match?
7802396	7802596	Yeah.
7802736	7803697	Yeah, I have a new one.
7803737	7805318	I didn't even realize it won last time.
7805639	7808041	Technically, your song, whatever it was, should have been retired.
7808401	7810342	Yeah, I have a new song that I'm picking.
7810362	7810743	All right, good.
7810823	7812204	It's on one of those CDs, actually.
7812284	7812584	Oh, good.
7812624	7813005	Which one?
7814566	7816147	The one with the good, cool one.
7817008	7818129	Oh, the one that should be already in there.
7819270	7819610	All righty.
7820250	7822572	It's actually on both of them, so it doesn't really matter.
7822732	7823373	Okay, sounds good.
7823945	7826347	Alright, we're going to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.
7826367	7829590	We're starting fresh this week because we did go two weeks without a show.
7830471	7833393	So we're just going to go ahead and kind of restart tonight with the cage match.
7834774	7837817	And it goes a little something like this.
7842260	7842641	Alright.
7842661	7842921	Alright.
7843979	7844640	Here's the deal.
7845200	7848323	Join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
7848343	7851887	We're going to play three songs for you guys, and you guys get to pick your favorite.
7852247	7863178	And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bobani and Video Game Music Show, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we are not live.
7863942	7867124	So we're going to start off with three brand new songs tonight for you to pick from.
7867144	7868865	There is no reigning champion.
7869325	7874208	We'll start off tonight with DarkSakura's pick, since she's the only one that has her pick up and ready to go.
7874228	7875949	So we're going to start off with her.
7876029	7877310	I had it ready last week.
7877590	7879291	But, you know, we won't talk about last week.
7879672	7882213	So what did you pick for us, DarkSakura?
7882373	7885255	It's by a Czech group called Accent.
7885615	7885936	Sorry.
7886356	7891759	And this is a really weird video with a lookalike like Kylie Minogue in it, and these guys kept making out with her.
7892259	7893040	And it's called Kylie.
7894298	7894618	AXS with Kylie
7986750	8012150	We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car Heidi, give me just a chance, let's go out and dance We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car
8044630	8060648	I'm sure you have seen me, I'm dreaming about you every night, every night Kylie give me just a chance, let's go out and dance, we can get into the groove, I can watch you
8073143	8097323	We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me, like a shining star But I rather, know you on the backseat of my car You drive me crazy, you slowly drive me crazy That bloody baby, can't get you off my mind I should be lucky, I should be so lucky I should be lucky, to see you
8124975	8150383	We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car Kylie give me just a chance, let's go out and dance We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car
8163117	8167159	All right, though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Accent with Kylie.
8167179	8170341	Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with DarkSakura.
8170641	8171662	That song is great.
8172122	8176644	I mean, the style's kind of, you know, an older style, but the song's relatively new.
8177365	8179486	And the video's freaking hilarious, so it gets a 9.5.
8179746	8180186	Loki.
8181167	8184329	Kind of reminds me of Eiffel 65 a little bit.
8185709	8187130	But I like it.
8187150	8187530	It's funny.
8188031	8188191	Eight.
8190132	8190392	Bugs.
8191243	8193765	Actually, it sounds a lot like the Numa Numa song.
8196067	8196628	A little bit.
8196888	8197509	Scale of 1 to 10?
8199510	8199871	8 and a half.
8201913	8207157	I have to agree with Arcadian42 in our chatroom, who said this song is fruity.
8208459	8210761	However, for that reason, I loved it.
8210801	8211361	It was great.
8211401	8213283	It was a great cage match song, honestly.
8213323	8214544	It was funny and it was dancey.
8214764	8215145	9 and a half.
8215345	8217146	I'm putting the video in the chatroom, by the way.
8217226	8217547	Alright.
8218393	8220574	But there are still two more songs to go.
8220854	8221274	Who knows?
8221334	8222494	We may have something a little better.
8222654	8223335	We will find out.
8223495	8224155	It's your call.
8224535	8225775	Song number two is Loki's pick.
8225795	8226696	What did you pick for us, Loki?
8226936	8228857	I'm off the Good Cool Expander CD.
8230077	8236779	I don't really like Eurobeat, and this is a trance remix of Blame by Good Cool.
8237659	8238000	All right.
8239320	8241981	Here it is, Blame, the trance mix by Good Cool.
8266036	8273148	No more your memory will last Deep within my mind I will always find you
8380248	8383551	Deep within my mind I would always find emotions still alive
8485555	8487133	You've only got yourself to blame
8523147	8524188	DarkSakura.com
8549861	8554923	That sounded like Eurobeat with extra different... Eurobeat with different synths.
8555664	8557825	So, yeah, it was okay.
8558245	8561306	Because I really like Blaine, but I actually like the Eurobeat version better.
8562007	8563087	So it gets a 7.5.
8563407	8563647	Loki.
8563667	8568950	It's a 9 because I've been blasting this in my car with the windows down driving.
8569370	8569790	It's fun.
8570430	8570690	Bug.
8570710	8572831	I'm going to give it a 6.
8572911	8574012	It sounds like more of the same.
8576003	8576864	I kind of liked it.
8576884	8579405	I didn't like it as much as the Kylie song, but I kind of dug it.
8579425	8580106	It was pretty cool.
8580246	8581086	I'll give it an eight and a half.
8581967	8582287	All right.
8582947	8584128	Moving on to song number three.
8584208	8585609	Boy, am I feeling the pressure tonight.
8585749	8588350	And I'm pretty much conceding tonight's cage match.
8588390	8588870	I don't care.
8589311	8591492	I'm going to do a song where I don't care if you vote for it or not.
8592762	8603372	Because you might remember a couple weeks ago before we went on involuntary hiatus, I played a song called Why by DJ Sammy, which didn't get a single vote from any of you.
8603992	8607956	So I said, F you all, the next cage match, I'm going to play something shitty.
8608536	8609197	So here it is.
8610319	8625027	The band is M3 Helena Walsh and Stacey D. I have no idea what kind of name that is, but it's M3 Helena Walsh and Stacey D. It's called I Touch Myself, the Love to Infinity radio mix.
8625127	8627648	And yes, it is an update of that song.
8628609	8629129	Song number three.
8786738	8792866	I don't want you, I don't want anybody else When I think about you, I touch myself
8846952	8847573	All righty.
8848033	8851255	That was song number three in tonight's cage match.
8851715	8852235	Where's my background?
8852335	8852655	There we go.
8853076	8861200	Song number three in tonight's cage match, I Touch Myself by M3, Helena Walsh, and Stacey D. I touched myself right in the eye.
8861560	8863181	DarkSakura, what'd you think?
8863961	8872225	I wanted to cry because they took a song that was excellent in its original form and made it into just generic trance crap.
8872706	8873646	So it gets a three.
8874987	8875227	Loki!
8876488	8877949	It's remixed by numbers.
8879510	8883572	Take song, add different backbeat, done.
8884152	8884773	I didn't like it.
8885013	8891997	It made me... It was like that song was the whole, and seven days later I'm going to become gay having listened to that song.
8893137	8894678	So I think it's a six.
8895239	8895619	Bugged.
8897020	8900902	Yeah, I touched myself in the eye and then the nose, and... Yeah.
8901962	8902243	Two.
8902623	8902943	All right.
8903797	8904398	I do not need that imagery!
8933032	8938136	And song number two you can vote for tonight is Good Cool with Chorus K with Blame the Transmix.
8950443	8953045	And song number three you can vote for tonight, I Touch Myself.
8963980	8964861	All right, kids.
8965201	8967522	Place vote now.
8967622	8971504	Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
8972084	8973205	We have to play this song now.
8973765	8974345	What song is this?
8975065	8976506	The V-Rare stuff.
8976926	8977967	Oh, we'll get to the V-Rare.
8978687	8981188	Because I found that song that I was talking to you about.
8981208	8985851	Remember when we were sitting at E3 and we're watching, you know, the Groovaloos do their thing up there in that song?
8985871	8988092	I'm like, that would be an awesome song to remix with...
8989002	8989442	No Limit
9012540	9014641	A lot of waiting is what's going on in the sim scene.
9014681	9016422	We're waiting for a few things.
9016482	9018383	We're waiting for Bomani Sale to come back up.
9018563	9023646	We're waiting for Food Mix 2 to be released next week.
9023986	9025207	It's coming out Friday, folks.
9025467	9027388	Only a few more days left on the 15th.
9028429	9032832	So keep an eye on Orange Ones Radio because we'll let you know when it's up and what we think about it.
9033752	9040616	Then we're also waiting to see what's going on with DDR East Coast Invasion because
9041430	9042630	They're still doing tournaments.
9043120	9045841	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9073755	9074156	FoonMix 2
9086548	9087529	Dream Mix TV World Fighters
9113976	9122424	And what it is, it's a collection of characters from Konami, from Hudson Soft, and one other company.
9122464	9125948	I can't remember the last company, but it is Super Smash Bros.
9125968	9126288	with us.
9126408	9130632	So, you get some really crazy matchups from Konami, for example.
9130932	9132454	Starting off, they have Simon Belmont.
9132814	9134676	They have Solid Snake.
9135297	9136037	That was unlockable.
9136077	9136818	Solid Snake.
9137419	9138620	They have Twinbee.
9139344	9140025	The Bathroom Yell
9158392	9159693	Okay, so they have Bomberman.
9160033	9163635	They had like some Barbie type chick or something like that.
9164495	9168116	They had, I want to say... Optimus Prime, bitch!
9168236	9169677	Optimus Prime, motherfucker!
9170197	9170738	Bomberman!
9170838	9171658	Bomberman was in it.
9171698	9173319	Have you played this game, DarkSakura?
9174019	9174659	Have you played this game?
9175560	9178101	Goddamn, all I heard was Hudson Soft and I think Bomberman.
9178241	9181362	A Super Smash Brothers rip-off, well, clone-ish game.
9181741	9184864	with Konami characters and Hudson characters and Optimus Prime.
9185305	9185925	On what?
9186245	9186606	PlayStation 2.
9186646	9187607	PlayStation 2 Japanese.
9187947	9188768	Is it out when?
9188988	9189489	It's already out.
9189829	9190410	Ordering right now.
9191110	9192191	I have it on my PlayStation.
9192211	9192772	You've got to play it.
9193052	9199959	We did a matchup with Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime, who, by the way, turns into a truck.
9199979	9204543	That was great, watching Optimus Prime turn into a truck and beat people, run people over.
9204563	9205524	They have characters from...
9206770	9218801	Bloody Roar Adventure Island Master Higgins It's not as good as Smash Bros.
9219162	9220283	It's not as good as Smash Bros.
9220323	9221444	but it's still pretty damn fun.
9221984	9222865	I had fun playing it.
9223105	9224086	But it's very Japanese.
9224366	9225928	It's very Japanese.
9226368	9227169	So I think it's
9227594	9228895	Too much of a culture shock thing.
9254096	9255117	and then it was, where's Jamie?
9256618	9259240	I'm sorry, I was in the bathroom, thank you.
9259280	9260861	No, not now, before the show.
9260921	9263023	And then I walked back here and then suddenly the front door opened.
9263103	9264884	Oh, speak of the devil, literally.
9265885	9266225	Kisses.
9266886	9267206	Alright.
9268327	9269728	I was there too before I came here.
9270289	9273671	Alright, we're going to tally up those cage match votes right now and we're going to take a break.
9273851	9278815	In this break, DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare music.
9278875	9280056	We got it, here it is.
9280076	9281137	We're going to hear it in this break.
9282478	9287721	Some of the shorter songs from... Was that NCSX sold out on Mario Mix?
9287901	9290583	Yeah, DDR Mario Mix sold out on NCSX.
9292164	9292964	Diet Channel?
9293785	9294265	Here we go.
9294605	9298488	We're going to hear in this break, because we picked some of the shorter songs, because we're not going to be able to play the whole thing.
9298868	9302350	You Gotta Move It, which is the new song that's going to be playable.
9302450	9303351	It's very sexy.
9304291	9305852	Destiny, the piano version.
9306473	9308934	I Need You, the inside-out outdoor mix.
9309234	9311015	And Infinite Prayer, all in this break.
9311416	9311976	We'll be back.
9312495	9312735	Enjoy!
9403090	9407551	Let the music fill your cell Let your body take control Falling, my whole world is falling
9428502	9430163	Thank you for watching!
9456397	9463201	DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
9487780	9509610	I could keep on following you, never letting you go Following you, losing all my pride Callin' on you and never letting you go Following you, but you'd run You, you were the destiny I was planning for eternity
9513392	9531363	Something came and took you away from me Baby, you, you were my destiny You were the only man in this world for me, meant for me But now you've brought away destiny
9576800	9592235	I'm not talking happiness, I know you must be aware that the lies I tell you doesn't matter when it's all together And you don't have to wait for me to let you go I'm with you, with you, I'm with you all the time, all the time
9646973	9648474	Thanks for watching!
9712651	9713291	Thanks for watching!
9773775	9782301	Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
9782441	9783782	Orange Lounge Radio.
9786164	9789487	Hello boys and girls, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.
9791568	9797152	I almost want to call that Target store back tomorrow morning and see if that coffee got sold or somebody went and slapped him on the wrist or what.
9797773	9798253	We'll see.
9798573	9799234	It's out there now.
9800259	9825233	Anyway, in that break, some music from the DDR Extreme 2 VRare, You Gotta Move It, featuring Julie Regard, I think it is, Destiny, Piano Version, I Need You, Inside Out, Dormix, and Infinite Prayer, all from the new VRare, which, by the way, I tried to get at a GameStop yesterday, or I should really say Miklatov tried to get at a GameStop yesterday, which I don't really get, because, you know, he kind of works for Konami, and he doesn't have a copy of the VRare yet, but we were trying to get one from GameStop, and couldn't get one.
9826426	9827829	This is the weird thing, though.
9828009	9829853	I haven't gotten one yet.
9830233	9830955	No, this is the weird thing.
9831215	9833840	They said they had given some out, but they thought they had one left.
9833980	9835924	They had the cover and no disc in it.
9836829	9837670	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
9858602	9861805	or just wanted to hear it, haven't gotten your viewers yet.
9861845	9862905	Those were some of the tracks.
9863686	9868149	Other tracks, some repeats from previous games you've probably already heard before on the station.
9868750	9875054	Some other long version mixes, but we just don't have time to play those because they're like 7 or 8 minutes.
9876295	9877916	We can play the Seduction vocal mix, it's only 4.40.
9879017	9886262	Maybe we'll get to that if we have time, but we're running a little late in show actually because usually we get to the FUs of the week around 8.30 and frickin' now it's 9.15.
9888882	9889042	Rage!
9912252	9918074	My first FU of the week goes toward sleeping for 12 hours and waking up sick.
9920695	9924436	Also another FU goes to Battletech because it makes me motion sick.
9925276	9926817	Another FU goes toward...
9930715	9935179	I actually have something I can't say on the air, so just a generic F you towards something that's stuck in my head.
9936000	9941384	And another one goes toward being sick, again, and having to go to work.
9942105	9942525	That's it.
9944266	9945427	Alright, Loki's turn.
9945507	9946328	Oh yeah, one more.
9947269	9948930	F you to World Geography, thank you.
9949911	9951572	Alright, let's go to Loki.
9951653	9951973	Loki.
9952885	9967861	I have one that's stuck in my mind, and that's basically, fuck you to the firewall that's at my work, because now I can't view a lot of sites because they're, you know, under different, like, logs, you know, like, spam or chat or whatever.
9968261	9972145	At one point we had, like, almost the whole internet blocked because they were messing with the filters.
9972185	9973066	Do you guys use WebSense?
9973706	9978810	No, they have this Barracuda spy blocker thing, or Barracuda firewall or something.
9979230	9982212	That sucker, you know, it doesn't like proxy servers either.
9982232	9985115	I tried getting around it that way, but no luck.
9985435	9990739	Anyways, yeah, but fuck that, because now I can't read stuff on LiveJournal, and it cuts down one more page I can read.
9991368	9993730	Welcome to the world that the rest of us have to live in at work.
10021739	10025560	I'm going to give an F you to vacation being over, because I don't want it to end.
10028081	10031541	So an F you to the fact that vacation's running out and I actually have to go back to work tomorrow, that sucks.
10033102	10036523	And an F you to GameStop that didn't have the copy of the beer I ran yesterday, because I wanted that.
10037283	10043504	And an F you to the fact that the systems at Dave & Buster's went down for a little while yesterday, which took away from my precious playtime.
10044865	10050046	An F you to the fact that I can't stop eating Cold Stone, because that ice cream is delicious, and it makes me fat.
10051634	10055957	and an F you to that guy in Final Fantasy XI who called me a cheap white mage because I don't have a race.
10056438	10059900	Fuck you, I've tried to do BCNM40 I don't know how many times, I can't get that damn scroll.
10060221	10062682	I can't win it for my life, so... F you!
10062863	10063983	I hate you, no cures for you.
10065464	10067846	I like being a white mage because if I don't like somebody, I'll let them die.
10069828	10071509	And let's go- oops, I'm sorry, lag, huh?
10073050	10075552	Let's go to Bugged with any F yous he might have.
10076192	10078114	F you to your Comcast DVR.
10079395	10079595	Why?
10080603	10082324	It doesn't work like a TiVo.
10083005	10084606	I told you it's not as good as TiVo.
10084646	10085346	Good God.
10086447	10088408	I thought you meant it didn't record suggestions.
10088468	10089969	I didn't know it wouldn't go back.
10091490	10094932	Well, and also since I haven't been on the show in a while, I left you to breaking my collarbone.
10097574	10098754	Glad to see you up and about.
10099575	10107680	Yes, Rob saw me, what, a couple of days afterward at a party, and I pretty much sat in a chair and vegged out, drank a lot of beer, and...
10108872	10112254	And we all laughed at pictures of ourselves from junior high and high school.
10112614	10113575	No, mostly just mine.
10114475	10116396	And Brian's, but that's because he wasn't there.
10119378	10126321	Let's see, oh, FQ to the ER, but... Because when I broke my collarbone, I had to go to the ER.
10126421	10132504	I am unemployed, I do not have insurance, and it was actually a lot less than I thought it would be, but the fact that I didn't have insurance sucked.
10132865	10135326	Next time I fall and break my collarbone, I'm going to try and do it in Canada.
10137312	10138653	Yeah, I've got a plan on that.
10140234	10142294	Put it on the itinerary for next time I go up to Vancouver.
10142334	10144255	Fall off bike, break collarbone.
10148357	10149278	Not many other FUs.
10150198	10150538	Alright.
10152699	10154680	Wow, that music was too happy for an FU, I'm sorry.
10158062	10158802	Chatroom FU time.
10159755	10170079	Sakurina says, F you to rain, the public transportation that isn't on time, trains and all of that happening on the same day, causing me to walk home from school in the rain and staying stuck there due to a train crossing.
10171459	10175221	Tomokun would like to say, fuck life 365, fuck, fuck, fuck idiots.
10175841	10187045	Uh, let's see, Dark Knight would like to say, my F you goes to my Advance Wars DS game for being hard as hell, and an F you to loneliness, no one in the world deserves to be all alone in the world.
10187065	10187305	Aw.
10189329	10216322	SpiritSnare says F you to Tokyo Game Action for getting Happy Sky F you to certain Target stores for releasing We Heart Katamari earlier than they're supposed to F you to others for not Not Google, but Goggle says F you to Lowe's Cineplex in Danbury, Connecticut for not letting me into an R-rated movie Also F you to school starting at 7.45 every morning I think I've been to that theater in Connecticut Go figure, I've been to a lot of really random places
10217548	10220469	DarkTetsuya says, A continued FU to this crappy connection.
10220849	10222590	An FU to CCL's card system.
10222650	10225490	No one explained that the cards expire, so I had to find out the hard way.
10226551	10228571	Yeah, I read that in your LJ and I was pissed too.
10229511	10233473	Rini would like to say, I have an FU to diarrhea or indigestion.
10235153	10244936	You know, in the 155 episodes we've done of Orange Lounge Radio, you think that's something someone would have said FU to a long time ago because...
10247818	10249379	You didn't flat out say diarrhea.
10250819	10255240	You did say indigestion, but... No, F you to the medication the doctor puts you on.
10255960	10263401	I have done an F you, though, to drinking a lot of Hawaiian Punch and coloring my feces blue.
10264702	10266742	So I think that kind of tops that one.
10267782	10270983	If you eat asparagus, it turns your pee a different color, too.
10272263	10275544	If you have honey smacks, it makes your pee smell like honey smacks.
10276004	10276384	Did you know?
10276997	10279601	That sounds incredibly nasty in both cases.
10280642	10282364	First off, why are you sniffing your pee?
10283666	10285509	It's just, that stuff is so strong.
10285589	10287832	It's the aroma that wafts up from the toilet.
10287912	10289935	Exactly, it's like, honey smacks.
10290576	10292118	Rob's red, look, Rob's red.
10293471	10295913	I can't believe this show has literally gone into the toilet.
10296373	10308099	Hey, we can't make poo-poo jokes anymore, so... Don't want you to compile a website of all the different foods that will make your bile and... Your one and two smell like something else.
10309259	10312541	I can imagine some of our listeners are now going to go, Really?
10313126	10314868	and, like, drink a whole gallon of blue wine.
10314908	10318150	The blue wine punch, that shit is awesome, but they don't sell it anymore.
10318491	10326658	They don't sell the blue stuff, they sell green and, like, orange and stuff, so, and red, and I don't, you know, want to drink a gallon of red.
10326778	10329180	I like the blue stuff, and they don't sell it, and that sucks.
10330021	10330842	Anyway, moving on.
10331622	10334745	F you to everybody, because I have a Sega CDX and no one else.
10337387	10338068	Sega CDX.
10338188	10339169	Duh, duh, duh, duh, huh?
10340359	10344060	Renee's saying an F you to everybody because he has a CDX and nobody else does, but you have one, don't you?
10345481	10346541	Um, yeah.
10347462	10349302	Actually, I have a regular say, I have both.
10349862	10350943	I have like all three, I think.
10351543	10353864	I'm sure you know what sort of context I mean in that last one.
10356705	10362787	Zaku would like to say F you to being unemployed for nearly nine months and F you to not getting work study this year.
10363550	10367495	F you to not having to wait this long to order my books for school.
10367935	10374602	F you to State University of New York University Police for giving us heat for having lots of people in the front of our apartment on Friday and Saturday nights.
10378827	10385014	Sin, or S1N, fuck you to there not being any retarded Target stores in Canada.
10387758	10388739	Is there Target in Canada?
10388999	10389459	I hope so.
10389499	10390440	You guys are really missing out.
10390760	10391821	Okay, there is Target in Canada.
10392021	10393322	And the Walmart doesn't have a star in the middle.
10393342	10393922	It has a dash.
10394843	10395904	Who fucking cares?
10396124	10396804	I don't know.
10397285	10400487	Well, if you watch shows that are supposedly in the U.S.
10401047	10403189	and they're actually filmed in Canada, you can tell.
10404590	10406571	You've got a lot of free time on your hands, don't you?
10407092	10413696	There's a Walmart or Target commercial when it's showing what is out here known as Best Foods mayonnaise.
10413896	10415017	It shows actually Hellman's.
10417079	10423024	ColorOfSakura says, F you to silly high school drama that I keep getting pulled into because people think I care.
10424165	10426807	Just remember... Yeah, it gets better in college.
10428628	10429950	Because there's lots of drinking involved, too.
10429970	10430130	Yep.
10430410	10432512	Ron Chan says, F you to the con I'm staffing for.
10432532	10434994	I'm in charge of two departments, and I got no help here.
10435034	10435514	I need a drink.
10437376	10441419	John Field says, F you to my sudden loss of interest in Phantasy Star Online.
10441779	10445362	Here I'm trying to pull out a machinima?
10445723	10446203	Machinima?
10446909	10450870	and I'm finding I can't play the game normally anymore without feeling totally drained.
10450990	10452191	Oh well, it was a good five-year run.
10453391	10456592	I've owned that fucking game on like four different systems and I never want to play it again.
10456812	10456952	Sorry.
10456972	10458732	I haven't played it since I got married.
10459393	10463594	Bacanico says, F you for not having any targets in the area so I cannot check one.
10463974	10465474	Or, I'm sorry, Weehart Katamari.
10465815	10466395	Uh, Bob.

10497290	10500932	You need to tell him about that live taping of This Week in Tech that's going on in NorCal.
10500952	10505634	Yes, there's going to be... There's two podcasts I'll listen to, this one and This Week in Tech.
10506075	10507836	Technically, this right now is not a podcast.
10507936	10508156	I know.
10508196	10508876	The podcast will be later.
10509476	10511317	The one you guys... I know, I know what you mean.
10512138	10514399	And This Week in Tech will be filming in Larkspur.
10514599	10517900	Not necessarily filming, but recording before a live audience in Larkspur next week.

10552446	10554367	FU to Christopher for not bringing anything for us
10574858	10578721	Sure, I saw Serenity, which was really, really, really well done.
10578761	10580362	I recommend it to everybody.
10580622	10583184	FYI, he's a little bit biased because he's a Buffy whore.
10583464	10584005	That's okay.
10586146	10588208	DarkSakura agrees with me, right?
10588228	10590469	I wanted to go, and I couldn't.
10590489	10591210	I have something for you.
10591230	10591930	It's a bunch of nuts.
10595113	10601037	I found out the other day, because this was last week after we watched, or we...
10602170	10616361	And that reminded me of the trailer that was on one of them for the whole, I guess, because it's a gay porn version of The Ring.
10616561	10617081	And guess what?
10617161	10621824	Our company is actually distributing that, which is hilarious.
10621844	10622505	I missed that.
10623345	10623665	Yes!
10624246	10624446	Yeah.
10624986	10630850	You know how a lot of pornos will, like, do funny, like, play on, you know, the regular movie title?
10630890	10634512	Like, I remember there was a porno once, um, it was Ally McFeel was a porno.
10635553	10637494	Well, now, yeah, Word of Penis Hands I've seen.
10637514	10640677	Um, I saw, the first one I ever saw was The Bonehead.
10640777	10643278	Uh, Beaver and Buttface is another one I've seen.
10643318	10645180	Before You're Gay, You See the Hole.
10645840	10649422	So, yeah, that, now they're doing The Ring, except it's the gay version.
10649462	10650123	It's the hole.
10650183	10651264	It's totally hot, too.
10651504	10652745	I recommend that movie, too.
10654033	10656854	Oh, and I saw the Exorcism of Emily Rose, which was okay.
10656874	10659015	It was okay?
10659255	10659435	Yeah.
10659715	10660875	But Serenity was great.
10660996	10661616	I recommend that.
10661656	10663096	Two thumbs up.
10663176	10666517	Two thumbs up and... You need to come up with a gay rating system.
10666758	10667878	Two cocks up.
10670139	10671299	I give it two hard dicks up.
10671379	10671619	Okay.
10673100	10673620	Here's Loki.
10674520	10674921	No, no, no.
10674961	10677321	It's two hard dicks up my ass.
10680122	10680963	Okay.
10681383	10681763	Yeah.
10682847	10684888	Wow, I didn't see it going in that direction.
10687929	10689629	But anyways, we got a late FU.
10689849	10691170	You'll like this one, Loki.
10691490	10695271	Spirit Snare says, FU to Apple replacing the iPod Mini with the iPod Nano.
10698412	10698992	Just thought I'd share.
10699032	10700073	Anyway, what do you got?
10700093	10701253	We got a couple minutes left here.
10701273	10701733	What do you want to say?
10701793	10702614	What do I want to say?
10702934	10706075	I want to say that I was reading the other day...
10707731	10710253	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
10735094	10737035	I want to know why they aren't sending me free samples.
10737075	10737975	That's what I want to know.
10738475	10740716	Why aren't you sending me this shit for free?
10740796	10741977	I should be having it already.
10743277	10745038	Namco Battle Collection, my ass.
10745698	10746139	You know what?
10746959	10748400	I just can't wait for Burnout Revenge.
10748420	10749520	It's coming out next week.
10750921	10751681	I love that game.
10752781	10755663	I had to get Burnout Legends to tie me over.
10755743	10758544	It's kind of a transitional into Burnout Revenge.
10759584	10760785	I'm going to be playing that for months.
10763268	10765669	Alright, until Liberty City Stories comes out.
10766209	10766369	Huh?
10768310	10769170	Oh, did we do the Cage Match?
10769210	10770230	I love that we did Cage Match Winners!
10770430	10772691	Oh, fuckin' A. Who did win the Cage Match?
10772711	10773491	There's the vote tally.
10773932	10777833	Tonight's Cage Match winner was... It was actually very close.
10778013	10781154	All three songs got a lot of votes tonight, so everybody should feel really good.
10781834	10782454	But this one won.
10786236	10787516	Good cool!
10787556	10788116	Featuring Jeff Koop.
10788136	10789517	Yeah, I'll have to find a song for next week.
10789557	10790137	Woohoo!
10791037	10792098	Alright, congratulations there.
10792158	10792878	That was a very close one.
10796023	10799006	Also, I wanted to give a couple other plugs since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks.

10823486	10829667	I heard that the Apple iTunes, their store, their little ranking system's rigged, the whole thing.
10829707	10836689	You basically can subscribe and unsubscribe rapidly, and it just counts how many times you click the button, and it'll move your... I heard they fixed that.
10837529	10841830	They didn't, because there was a little thing on Dig about it.
10842610	10845891	It came up, and it's still broken, so that sucks.
10849309	10849649	All right.
10850949	10851430	End of show.

10871875	10872735	Reject both icons.
10873495	10874375	You're still a newlywed.
10874515	10875776	You should have a reality TV show.
