319	2900	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 19th, 2005.
3000	13525	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
13805	17306	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19127	27531	Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, a radio dedicated to what gamers really want to know.
28322	29223	You know that little bastard on...
55791	57612	What was that site?
57652	59734	I'm not going to name it.
60014	68720	But I just have to say that I've probably been gaming since that little newbie wannabe was in diapers.
69440	73223	I was sitting there with my Pong machine back in the day.
74104	76545	I am more the gamer than you will ever hope to be.
78032	81535	I had to address it and get it out of my system.
81555	82175	Feel better?
82475	83916	Yeah, I actually do feel a lot better.
84116	86758	But that's also proof that I'm anything but giggly and ditzy.
86798	87479	Thank you very much.
88039	89420	She's a real bitch, ladies and gentlemen.
89440	89520	I am.
89580	90281	I really am.
91362	91742	Loki.
92802	94103	Say hello to Tech Master Loki.
94143	94623	How you doing?
94943	95604	I'm doing good.
95904	98565	Who also is a really big bitch, if you get to know him.
99106	99306	Huh?
99766	100186	No, forget it.
100766	101287	What's on your mind?
101627	102407	Loki, how you doing?
102888	103688	Not much.
104448	105429	What the hell is this you're looking at?
105629	108471	Is this like Deer Hunter on the Xbox 360 or something?
108491	109271	What is this screenshot you've got?
109291	110872	No, that's a screenshot of Elder Scrolls 4.
112333	114114	It looks like a Deer Hunter game to me.
114134	117916	It looks like the deer from the deer scene in Ring 2, which sucked.
117936	121598	But you know, they will come out with a Deer Hunter game, I'm sure, for that game.
122096	124537	For the Walmart arcades across America.
124797	131340	Have you ever noticed that every Walmart arcade, quote unquote, you've ever walked into, has some type of deer hunting machine, at least around here.
132440	134461	There's always some type of deer hunting machine and a crane.
134927	137068	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
137088	146610	I know you've been doing a lot of giggling and having all those slumber parties and talking about boys, but if you actually had any time to play some games, what were you able to find?
156977	164023	Well, I don't know, out of the 40-something video game systems that I own, have I not been able to find something to play?
164183	169006	No, seriously, I've been playing my Nintendogs, trying to keep them from running away and pissing on my dinner.
169147	170408	That's such a girl game!
170888	171749	You play it too, okay?
171989	172729	Oh yeah, that's right.
172749	175251	And so does Loki over here, who owns three copies of it.
176192	177513	I'm thinking of selling two of them.
178314	178734	Give me one.
179415	179955	No!
180375	180736	Puppies!
181576	182397	Alright, so Nintendogs.
182881	183461	Yeah, I didn't tell those.
183481	183742	Puppies!
185063	190527	I've been playing with my puppies, and then I got World of Warcraft and installed it today.
191067	191548	Finally!
191628	194350	Like a year later, one of us gets sucked into World of Warcraft.
194970	196011	Not quite sucked in.
196051	197212	I'm sort of pissed off.
197292	200835	Actually really livid for the lack of controller option.
201255	205378	I mean, I can play on the keyboard, but the controller is so much more efficient.
206039	209441	Especially since I got used to playing that way on that game that sucks.
211103	212704	Which is the game I still play, thank you very much.
213809	214530	That's my opinion on it.
235854	236634	WarpGH.
236654	237915	Okay, thanks.
238055	238415	Bye.
238675	240395	Fuck you.
240455	242676	For the people who say, warp me to here, warp me to here.
242996	245876	I wanted a priest with only the gas time warp.
246757	251238	So that if they say, warp me to Christmas place.
251278	255059	You know, 5% of our audience has probably ever played Ragnarok and guessed that.
255399	255879	Warp me to Ludi.
255919	258679	Gas time's like the haunted place where big horrible things kill you.
259280	262280	I was level 70-something and I still couldn't beat everything there.
264301	264661	Anyway...
266727	267387	I played that.
267467	268948	I played actually a few online games.
268968	271649	I've been playing something on gorillas.com.
272490	275191	I've been playing Frogas.
277352	277993	Okay.
278013	281294	There's things you can do on the site and collect items and do certain things.
281714	285876	And one of the things is you collect this potion that you go up to Noodle's room and insert into Sean Ryder's head.
287077	287297	Okay.
287337	289038	And to get the last potion, you have to play Frogger.
289992	292133	But it's like you go there, get the potion, and come back.
292793	293614	And it's like horrible.
293734	294554	Silly flash games.
294854	295835	Silly flash games, yeah.
295855	296455	It's kind of fun.
297595	302758	Dan also picked up Nightshade and Ico because they got really cheap and he gets a discount in the store.
303318	307160	And he picked up whatever that Burnout game is on PSP and has been playing it religiously.
307760	311221	Burnout Legends, as I'm sure Loki will talk about a little bit earlier.
311582	318605	Honestly, the more I hear Burnout, the more pissed off I get because I was trying to do my fucking illustrator homework on Saturday night.
318665	318925	Uh-huh.
319885	321948	and not Saturday night, I'm sorry, on Friday night.
322428	328436	And he comes in, him and his buddy playing Burnout as loud as our 50-inch widescreen TV would go.
329677	331900	And I was PMS and hardcore that night.
333001	336265	I went out there, let him have it, ate a bunch of chocolate and went to bed.
337992	338352	Alright.
339553	341154	So right now that game is on my shit list.
341234	347239	Well, I was going to recommend for World of Warcraft, check out some of the communities out there because I bet you somebody's got a mod out there.
347499	349720	You can't be the only one who desires to play controllers.
349740	351622	There's got to be something going on out there, so check it out.
351662	355264	You can mod pretty much everything in World of Warcraft using Lua.
355284	355344	Hmm.
358517	359237	All the interfaces.
359438	371423	Someone actually created an auction interface where it will tell you what the item that you're trying to sell is going for, what the previous history is, and what they think that you can get for it and that type of stuff.
371603	372203	That's pretty cool.
372924	373284	Sounds cool.
373844	375105	All right, Loki, what have you been playing this week?
375565	377126	I've been playing Burnout Revenge.
378626	380647	And that game is awesome.
381268	385029	The first thing we did, started playing Traffic Attack because there's nothing like driving 209 miles an hour
386986	396172	and smashing into every single car in the world on this, you know, freaking track and just having them fly over you like a wake of water.
396272	397693	It's just, it's great.
397874	399154	It's the most fun ever.
399495	405599	And the takedown mode, when you're playing that, you can actually use the crash breaker, which makes your car explode.
406039	408041	So that's really fun as well.
409201	412944	The only complaint I have about it is the new way that they're doing the crash mode.
413224	414485	They have this kind of, it's almost like
415026	417249	Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games
432110	438094	It's really strange how they've done that, and I didn't quite get it at first, so I made my car explode or stall and stuff like that.
438734	440415	But other than that, it's pretty cool.
441996	445178	I just can't wait to unlock more cars, because it's been pretty tough to do that.
446358	449820	And then Burnout Legends, I've been playing that for the PSP, and that game's fun.
450081	458726	The only thing that sucks about that game is that game forces you to play with other people, because in order to unlock all the cars, there's six cars that are...
459773	464197	for each game, and you have to actually go play other people with those cars.
464517	466739	It's almost like Nintendogs, is what they're doing with it.
468260	469201	So that's pretty much it.
469221	469982	Just racing games.
470082	471843	Just burnout, burnout, burnout, all week long.
472304	476107	Yeah, I'm going to try to pick... I have Urban Rain.
476407	477388	I should try to play that.
477468	481151	It's kind of a fighting game, but beat-em-up game at the same time.
481231	481992	It's like Tekken.
483313	486095	It actually has Paul Phoenix and Law in it.
486758	487178	Oh, okay.
487318	488339	From the Tekken series.
488619	494423	Which, had I known that when I was selling it, I probably would have sold it a bit better, but oh well.
496454	497835	All right, let's see.
497915	498856	What have I been playing this week?
500037	502738	I had a seven-hour marathon of Final Fantasy XI this weekend.
502798	506821	Never again will I play an MMO for that long.
506841	510724	But it was one of those things where it was like there was a mission and we all wanted to get it done.
510764	512205	And on top of that, I'd already been leveling.
512245	515928	It was like I really had a lazy Saturday in every essence of the word.
516168	519110	And so I'm sure some MMO addicts out there, they're cheering me on right now.
519150	522252	But my God, that was just too much MMO for me on Saturday.
522728	525410	I haven't played Final Fantasy XI for a long time.
525510	527791	I have enough PTO where I can take a couple days off.
533374	534014	What else did I play?
534515	535975	I got to check out a couple new games.
536016	538337	I actually went out and bought a copy of Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks.
538797	539578	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
561414	561934	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
579361	580843	Deception Deception Deception Deception
594139	595480	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
612875	618039	Remember when they tried to do that, was it that side-scrolling RPG type game with Sub-Zero in it?
618059	618500	It was awful.
618920	620481	The Mythologies games were awful.
620581	623403	No, but this one is surprisingly pretty fun.
623544	624084	It's really good.
624604	626686	It's pretty action-based.
627427	631250	Honestly, the best comparison I can think of is the Ninja Turtles arcade game, except it's...
631710	636597	It's Mortal Kombat characters and you're just beating people up left and right and you can do all these fancy combos.
636937	640482	And as you gain experience, you can purchase new combos and new things.
641303	642424	So it's actually a lot of fun.
642925	648653	My only minor complaints with Shaolin Monks is that there's just some real basic...
649460	653383	Gameplay mechanic things that don't work for me, such as the fatalities.
653743	669154	I think the fatalities are kind of fun and it's kind of cute they put them in there, but unfortunately you only get one fatality in the beginning and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've been playing the game for a couple hours now and I just got like a new fatality called a multi-ality or something like that.
669474	672957	Well, they're supposed to be looking in the list of blank fatalities, like 20 different things you can do.
673675	675076	I guess I haven't found any yet.
675116	676617	Maybe I'm supposed to find them myself.
676737	677217	I don't know.
677577	681500	But I get kind of bored with the fatality thing because I'm doing the same thing over and over.
681740	685242	Slice, slice, slice, you know, with the hat because I'm playing as Kung Lao right now.
685282	686683	So I'm doing the hat slice in half.
687043	690485	And it's cute at first and really funny and, you know, graphically well done.
690845	691926	But it gets old.
692246	699511	I think if the fatality combo meter filled maybe like half as fast, see, the fatality thing you only did half as often, I think it would have been better.
699551	701672	It seems like the fatality thing gets really repetitive.
701912	702412	Thank you for watching!
722040	727644	and so I kind of wish that at some point the enemies went away and left you alone for a little while so you could kind of figure out, okay, where do I go next?
727985	729125	And then new enemies come out.
729226	730687	So it kind of got a little monotonous there.
731367	734369	And then my only other complaint would be the lack of save points.
735370	738632	I can literally go 45 minutes in the game and not find a single save point.
738973	742055	So there really needed to be about twice as many save points as there are.
742115	743256	So that was a little bit frustrating.
743856	747779	Otherwise, though, those are just, you know, really in the grand scope of things, some minor complaints.
747899	749360	I think the game is a heck of a lot of fun.
749400	750541	If you're a fan of Mortal Kombat...
752324	757367	in any way, you're going to like this game because it really gets into the story better so than any of the movies ever did.
757967	760028	It really gets into the story and it does a great job.
760168	762049	Movies?
762129	763030	There was only one movie.
763190	763650	There was two.
764390	765331	There was only one movie.
765371	768533	I know you're denying the existence of it, but believe it or not, there was a second movie.
769033	771294	That's an hour and a half of my life I want back.
771454	774536	It was so good that they actually made a TV series too.
774556	775076	That's
775469	776190	That's right, huh?
776370	776750	Oh, God.
776910	780694	Anyway, just to put it in perspective, just how cool this game can be sometimes.
781054	788120	Like, I was playing this one level, the last level I was on, I was fighting Katana, Jade, and Mileena all at once, like this level.
788720	793745	And suddenly Katana, I don't want to spoil the story, but something happens where Katana's taken out of the picture, basically.
794205	822945	and then it's just Jade and Mileena and you can like throw them into these traps and then hit this switch and it goes into the test your might mode from like Mortal Kombat 1 where you have to really slam all the buttons they kind of overdo that a little bit in the game but it's still really cute that they brought back test your might and like if you do the test your might thing then you'll like set a fire trap so you can set Mileena on fire a little bit just cute little things like that I can't believe I called it cute but seriously like little things like that Mortal Kombat's so cute it's not cute anymore there's no babalities
824283	824923	or Animalities.
825043	826644	Friendship!
827884	830685	So Mortal Kombat, I recommend it to fans of the Mortal Kombat series.
831445	834826	And just if you like those action fighting style games, you'll probably get a kick out of this.
834926	837506	But if it doesn't sound like your kind of game, you're probably not going to like it.
837586	838547	You know what else?
838567	840247	Because that did get released earlier.
840287	842388	It was scheduled originally for the 21st.
843368	845528	They've got another fighting game coming out that looks pretty good.
845769	851170	And I actually played a demo of it, Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects, which is a Marvel game they actually kind of
851770	852431	and DarkSakura.com.
866378	869381	Really quick, the other game I played this week I want to give a real quick review to.
869421	879429	I actually got to play We Heart Katamari because as you might have heard on last week's show, Target, some of the Target stores acquired copies of the game and sold them early because the game's not actually out until this week.
879649	881711	So We Heart Katamari is going to be on shelves this week.
882052	884093	I did get a chance to play it via one of my friends.
884133	885875	I only got to play like the first two levels.
886375	890799	But I'm telling you what, kids, if you liked the first Katamari Damacy, you ain't going to be disappointed.
891079	894142	The movies are just as quirky as they were the first time.
894403	900529	It's kind of like the first game was so successful, they gave them a bigger budget to go through with the second game.
900569	903232	And you really see that they've kind of put more into this game.
903652	907877	And just, you know, it's more the same, but at the same time,
908815	909535	It just works.
909996	910936	I don't know how else to explain it.
910976	911656	It just works.
911716	913357	If you were a fan of the first game, you're going to like this game.
913657	916999	If you weren't a fan of the first game, I don't think there's anything new here that's going to win you over.
917239	920880	But if you haven't played the Katamari Damacy game, check this out.
921241	922821	It's just such a quirky little title.
923822	926103	I think you guys will get a kick out of it.
926223	930625	The music, not quite as solid as the first game, but the music's a lot of fun too.
931525	934947	And the script, the writing is just as hilarious as it was in the first game.
935187	935527	It's great.
936987	938108	Katamari fans won't be disappointed.
939090	939671	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
959813	960334	What is this?
960374	966360	The Nintendo nunchucks or something where you've got like the one little piece with the analog stick and then a remote control?
966400	967021	What's up with this?
967061	967841	What do you guys think of this?
968002	970224	You can check the pictures out on our website, orangelawnradio.com.
971225	972867	This technically goes into another segment.
972887	978412	Actually, one of our listeners emailed us, Brittany, who basically agreed with me.
978552	980835	It's like using a big freaking remote control.
982734	992414	Now Nintendo says, and I think part of the reason they're doing this is that they want to kind of lure in people that are a little scared of, you know, when they see like a gaming controller, they think, oh, it's a
992867	994908	It's a gaming thing, and I'm not really hip on this.
994948	998789	So, like, by making a remote control device, you know, everybody uses a remote control.
999150	1004992	They tried this before, sort of, with a system called the Fairchild Channel app.
1005372	1005692	Okay.
1006192	1010394	With a little, tiny little controller to tap in the little old stick that you hold.
1010474	1012475	It's a little different, but that controller sucked.
1012715	1014115	The whole system sucked, honestly.
1014176	1015776	So, do you think the revolution's gonna suck?
1016076	1016636	This controller?
1016937	1019178	Well, you know, the one thing that I say about a system...
1020818	1023280	A system is only as good as the games that are on it.
1023521	1023861	I agree.
1024201	1026764	But part of the game is how it's controlled.
1027344	1030447	That's a major part of the gameplay, right there, is how you're controlling it.
1031207	1032428	This thing looks uncomfortable.
1034150	1036232	Lately, my whole big thing has been ergonomics.
1037032	1043038	And like I said on our three-hour show, this one looks highly uncomfortable.
1043798	1045340	You're going to be holding your wrist...
1046269	1050831	Okay, take your hand, hold it straight up, turn your wrist sideways and do like you're holding a remote control.
1051471	1058854	Now imagine holding your hand in this position for an hour, two hours, however long you plan on playing a game.
1059534	1062075	Now do you think that that's a natural position for your hand to be in?
1063684	1065785	Imagine the stress you're putting your joints under.
1065825	1068427	Now imagine if you are an older gamer.
1068527	1070768	You work at, say, a desk job on a computer.
1071549	1073510	You're already putting your arm through stress that way.
1073670	1077993	Imagine the stress you're putting it through with this system that's supposed to help you relax, have some fun.
1078713	1079474	You're going to be hurting.
1080655	1084097	I think it's going to cause, you know, true medical issues.
1084497	1086938	Do you think, though, that this will come out in the testing process?
1087219	1092502	For instance, something I had brought up on our three-hour program when we were talking about this, the three-hour show, Sunday nights on OrangeOnlineRadio.com,
1093224	1105889	We were talking about this controller issue a little bit, and I mentioned that the DS at E3, the year that the DS came out, it changed from E3 to when it actually came out, and you said it's a little more comfortable than it was at E3.
1106169	1112492	So do you think that maybe after they test this a little bit, if they find these type of ergonomic issues with their testers, they might change this a little bit?
1112912	1119435	Make it, I don't know how they can drastically, without making drastic changes to the controller, make it a little more ergonomic, but maybe just the way the games play?
1119895	1120495	One would hope so.
1121156	1121916	One would really hope so.
1122256	1122617	So we'll see.
1122757	1124159	But don't knock it until you've tried it, right?
1124419	1124619	Yeah.
1124759	1125160	Absolutely.
1125400	1131188	I mean, I'll give it a fair go, but honestly, I'll get that little wave bird looking thingy that Loki posted about.
1131208	1132009	Now, what was that, Loki?
1132029	1133832	You posted like a mock-up on our website.
1133872	1135374	Was this a real deal picture or a mock-up?
1135414	1138938	A lot of our feedback is a mock-up of a wave bird controller.
1138999	1139720	It's something that they...
1140260	1144522	Was it the president of Nintendo's development or something like that?
1144883	1147144	They were talking about how they were going to be adding that.
1147544	1150846	It's just they're going to have a ton of attachments, which means more stuff you've got to buy.
1150866	1152987	Of course.
1153047	1155909	But I'm not saying that the other systems aren't doing that either, Microsoft.
1156049	1158570	And it looks good.
1158650	1160231	I think it'll work really well, actually.
1160471	1162352	I don't think it's going to be a problem at all.
1162432	1164353	I mean, you hold controllers in your hand.
1164373	1167915	I don't see, you know.
1167995	1168776	It's just like a remote.
1169702	1173985	I think if it's light enough, it's not going to be a problem.
1174105	1176166	I find remote controls uncomfortable.
1176327	1183351	The thing I like about it, though, is that you can take that remote control, turn it 90 degrees, and you've basically got an old-style NES controller.
1183431	1184192	And that would be cool.
1184292	1185112	Yep.
1185313	1189636	That would be more comfortable, but I'm thinking, though, the intended way, like a remote control.
1189836	1190056	Mm-hmm.
1191377	1195279	And I know this from experience, because I played Space Ace on my DVD player.
1195379	1195640	Right.
1195860	1197421	And I hurt by the time I was done.
1197441	1197721	Mm-hmm.
1198772	1201756	I know how this is going to feel and it's not natural.
1202236	1205320	Do you think maybe we're being misled by these pictures a little bit that are showing it?
1205520	1211608	Maybe this won't be the way it actually plays because I can't see how with your thumb you'd be able to hit that control pad and the button.
1211628	1213010	Have you guys seen the video of this?
1213858	1214799	I didn't have time to download it.
1214819	1216960	Have you guys seen the video from Tokyo Game Show?
1216981	1217581	Describe it for us.
1217821	1228269	Well, for example, the way it was shown, this is the video they showed everybody when they were unveiling it, is it actually looks like it's from the view that you're in the TV.
1228349	1228529	Right.
1229036	1244141	and basically you're using that as you're not using the buttons on the controller the controller itself because it acts like a 3D mouse is what you're using so for example some of the things that they're showing you could say this might be the next WarioWare game
1244641	1250604	A guy was chopping using the controller, acting like a knife, and frying stuff with like a knife.
1251324	1256847	I had heard, now I had read that there was a video out there, the Metroid Prime 2 Echo is being kind of played on this.
1256887	1257888	Yeah, they said it.
1257928	1261990	As moving around using the Bluetooth or whatever it is that's in there that senses where you are.
1262010	1264431	Well, the way it works is there's two sensors you put on your TV.
1265411	1269354	and it basically figures out, it triangulates where your controller is going to be.
1269374	1271656	Kind of similar to the Power Glove that came out.
1272097	1280384	Now, the other things that they showed with this is playing tennis, you know, like, you know, you would be just like racket fishing.
1281325	1283487	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1307404	1308684	And there you go, you're shooting something.
1308704	1311625	Or you want to switch your weapon, you know, hit the button on top there.
1311985	1315826	Plus, the analog has two buttons on it as well, two trigger buttons.
1315906	1318067	So, I think it's going to work.
1318407	1325889	Because, really, there's no way it can't work, because if a game calls for something else, they'll build another add-on for it.
1326149	1327009	As they always do.
1328209	1329670	Well, it'll be interesting to see what happens.
1329730	1334271	I'm sure we'll see more and more of this leading up to next year's E3, which I'm sure will be a big, big unveil.
1334311	1335351	And here's the other thing, too.
1336167	1336667	DarkSakura.com
1355036	1355537	Check that out.
1355637	1355957	Answer it.
1356037	1358298	What do you think of the Nintendo Revolution controller?
1358358	1361320	Now the real question is, what color Nintendo Revolution are you going to buy?
1361761	1362261	The green one.
1362601	1367785	Because they have the green, red, the gray, the chrome, white, and black.
1368625	1369386	We're going to have the red.
1370419	1370799	All right.
1371239	1374260	Also on our main page, we definitely want to take a minute to recognize this.
1374680	1380902	There is a banner right there for a fundraiser effort we're doing for Hurricane Katrina relief.
1380922	1381662	And it's not just us.
1381702	1387344	We're doing it together with some other companies in Sacramento, Dark Records and Club 21 slash Rapture.
1388064	1389965	And it's a fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina.
1390225	1391506	Thank you for watching!
1409865	1434237	if you're in the Sacramento area where our show is based there's a lot you can do to help out with this because you can actually donate at Club 21 on Thursday nights even if you're anywhere in the world we are taking financial donations and if you'd like it to be specifically for to be forwarded to the SPCA for pet relief note that and we'll collect all that money together and send it on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio so check that out
1435757	1440822	We did mention that we are working with Dark Records and Club 21.
1442243	1446127	Alright, moving on into some gaming news tonight.
1446227	1449510	Obviously a lot of news coming from the Tokyo Game Show.
1449931	1453634	Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots is the title.
1454175	1457558	Eight minute long preview for this game.
1457638	1458419	Did you check it out?
1458439	1458959	I checked it out.
1458980	1459400	What did you think?
1460023	1461104	It's interesting.
1461244	1462264	Snake is quite old.
1462745	1464405	Yeah, so it's going to be like a future thing now.
1464586	1464806	Yeah.
1464986	1469928	No, you know what I thought was the coolest thing was the little mini Metal Gear with Otakon on it that they took right out of Policenauts.
1470609	1471409	That was freaking cool.
1472610	1473110	Pretty cool.
1473811	1475792	So that's definitely something to look forward to.
1475832	1477993	I'm sure a lot of fans are looking forward to the Metal Gear.
1478293	1479074	I was reading, too.
1479154	1481435	A lot of people were thinking, oh, it's pre-rendered.
1481475	1483476	You know, it's crap.
1483516	1486598	They were saying, though, that they actually... What was it?
1486638	1487038	Kojima...
1487754	1504049	They showed that the actual presentation was actually being rendered real time and they stopped it and panned around Snake as well to stop those disbelievers from posting crap about it.
1505788	1506208	Interesting.
1506348	1506748	Looks good.
1507189	1514092	Speaking of Kojima, he basically said that Metal Gear Solid 4 will be his last.
1514492	1517334	But I kind of think, didn't he say the same thing after Metal Gear Solid 3?
1517374	1518934	That he was going to do another one?
1519074	1520655	We have Hulk Hogan syndrome here.
1521175	1525397	The man keeps saying he's going to retire, but he always shows up at WrestleMania.
1526458	1532741	Well, he also, now Kojima also says that Yoji Shinkawa, who's the art director, will be leaving with him.
1533385	1534406	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1549805	1551306	Which also, by the way, was kind of a bad movie.
1551326	1552627	Yeah, but that wasn't really Metal Gear.
1553108	1554589	I don't even think he acknowledges it.
1554849	1559453	Because there was actually a Metal Gear 2 on the MSX in Japan.
1559473	1565158	His direct quote was, I decided to make the real sequel to Metal Gear when he saw Snake's Revenge.
1567019	1567359	Ouch.
1569201	1578729	Alright, also coming out of Tokyo Game Show, those of you music game fans are going to be very pleased to hear that Konami, after a long hiatus, is going to be putting out brand new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania games.
1578749	1579109	That's right.
1579631	1584155	Gita Dora, as the series is sometimes referred to, is getting the V games released.
1584815	1596304	Don't know quite yet if it's a combo game, but since we know that all the previous PlayStation 2 releases, which ended at Guitar Freak's fourth mix and Drum Mania's third mix, were combined together.
1597024	1602648	To put this into some perspective for you guys, Guitar Freak's V, I think is what, the 11th or 12th?
1602969	1603429	I lost count.
1603469	1604030	I think it's like the 12th?
1604830	1633083	something like that guitar freaks in the arcade and the last one we got on PS2 was 4 so there's a whole lot of ground to cover here with these new games that are coming out on the PS2 gonna come out in 2006 in Japan no word yet if the series will finally make a crossover into America but I think what might make or break that would be Konami if they watch the success of Guitar Hero which is what Red Octane and Harmonix are gonna be putting out pretty soon I believe before the end of the year
1633561	1644262	so it'll be interesting to see if that does very well then Konami might try to take back the market that they kind of created overseas interesting way it works out there they'll take notice
1646581	1650064	Also, wanting to point out some Final Fantasy news from Tokyo Game Show.
1650104	1652706	Final Fantasy XI will definitely be expanding.
1653466	1663453	Treasures of At-Organ was announced officially, the new expansion pack, to be released with the Xbox 360, assumably, version of Final Fantasy XI.
1664114	1671819	Some early preview videos are hinting that Blue Mage will be one of the new classes, because in the video you could see—and this is one of the videos I did download, of course—
1672179	1678582	You can actually see, I think it was a human was breathing fire in one of the videos and like a Taro was shooting spider web using one of the spider's attacks.
1679542	1681803	Pretty neat looking artifact armor for Blue Mage 2.
1682263	1684724	Also, there's another mystery kind of job class.
1684784	1687265	Not quite sure what it is, but it looks like there's another job class in there too.
1687685	1689707	All you have to do is look to Tactics for your ideas.
1689967	1691309	Yep, look to Tactics for ideas.
1692510	1701900	I thought that Alchemist or Geomancer would be for sure, because I especially thought Geomancer with all the elemental focus and stuff, but it doesn't look like that's the new class.
1702140	1703381	World of Warcraft has that.
1703662	1705604	I know, but... Blue Mage would be cool.
1706553	1733157	but you know there's gonna yeah everybody's gonna be a blue mage all right so we will see um we don't have any details as to when these games are coming out but we're thinking i'm thinking anyway probably early 2006 i would say it would be a good guesstimate also final fantasy related now jamie this has to be a final fantasy game that you like because if not you're just not human final fantasy 4 will be coming out for now you smiled there you like final fantasy 4 right
1733578	1735559	Final Fantasy 4 is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.
1735599	1740222	Final Fantasy 4 is being ported to the Game Boy Advance in Japan on December 12th.
1740242	1741903	It will include new areas and get this, new characters.
1752610	1752770	Uh-oh.
1753010	1753570	Should be interesting.
1754051	1756791	My gut reaction tells me, oh my gosh, Palamonporum.
1756931	1759372	Finally, we'll be able to be unstoned and rejoin your party.
1759832	1760532	That would be cool.
1761053	1765034	I think that would be the perfect, the biggest fan pleaser that Square could do.
1765454	1768395	I know it's cheesy, but what a fan pleaser.
1768435	1770115	More Spoonie Bartness!
1770555	1771136	Yay!
1771376	1771556	Exactly.
1771816	1772536	So that should be cool.
1773836	1779558	No word yet if it's coming out in America, but Final Fantasy's pretty big here now, and they put out all the other...
1780154	1781056	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1792294	1793495	I do indeedy.
1793735	1800638	Alright, if you have letters, send it to our mailbag, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
1800658	1801678	We love getting your feedback.
1802119	1803159	DarkSakura, who wrote us today?
1803419	1810302	Sasuke sent us an email, a question we've been asked many, many times, actually just very recently tonight, about how we got our name.
1810602	1818166	Because he was talking about Orange Lounge, you know, the group, doing Mobomoga, all the Bimani stuff.
1818906	1823353	We were sitting on the BART one day, saying, you know, damn it, we want to do an internet radio station.
1823373	1824935	Which is a train in the Bay Area, for those who don't know.
1825196	1826858	The Bay Area Rapid Transit.
1828300	1834129	And we just came up with the name, because our three-hour show was Bibani-related, and that's how we started off.
1834429	1835330	Thank you for watching.
1835510	1836510	See you next time.
1850097	1855879	So Orange Lounge was just kind of like, you know, you like something, you name yourself after something related to it.
1855959	1863902	So we thought lounge because we kind of lounge around and have that whole Denny's vibe of just sitting around coffee and just talking about random stuff.
1863942	1864702	That's kind of what we do.
1864842	1866803	So Orange Lounge just seemed appropriate.
1868002	1871847	Got an email from one of our long-time listeners, Asian Buddy Paul.
1872027	1872248	Yes.
1873049	1876213	Said, I'd just like to say how much I love the podcast.
1876273	1879697	I used to listen to the live show Sundays, but I can't catch them anymore.
1879817	1880158	Tear.
1880598	1881159	So I love it.
1882320	1882541	Thank you.
1883602	1889770	And he just got married on his Ragnarok online private server, so congratulations, I think.
1890190	1891572	No, nerd.
1891992	1892974	You nerd.
1893695	1895777	You got married in an online game, you nerd.
1895998	1899302	He was wanting us to play one of our cage match winning songs.
1900359	1904421	Oh, the Cage Match we do as part of the three-hour show when we play random music.
1904661	1908502	And I'd actually answered back saying, you know, sort of separate this, that, and the other.
1908522	1916125	You run into all those licensing problems because our live station is run through Live 365, which pays a lot of licensing fees up front.
1916786	1921388	When it comes to podcasts, can you play copyrighted music in podcasts?
1921428	1924529	It's kind of a big question mark right now because, you know, it's...
1925612	1927472	It's kind of a gray area, so we don't do it on this.
1956309	1957469	I saw this link.
1957549	1958249	Oh my gosh.
1958309	1963090	So this is Dance Dance Revolution, except it's all Christian music.
1963110	1964071	DDR God version.
1965491	1969232	It's the, like they took a bunch of Christian music labels and put it together.
1970592	1972352	Made their own version of DDR.
1972372	1977754	Actually, looking at this now, because for a moment I was thinking, oh, DDR, yay.
1978314	1979834	But it does reverse scrolling.
1980632	1986156	Yeah, it's kind of... Well, they have to change it a little bit, or they might get sued by Konami, just like, you know, the folks who made In the Groove got sued.
1986176	1989418	Honestly, it shows them freaking playing on Konami dance pads.
1991099	1992881	It's a damn Stepmania version.
1992921	1994121	It's Stepmania, is all it is.
1994141	1994842	It's Stepmania.
1994942	1995422	Probably.
1995642	2004529	But, you know, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game, I go for it, but I don't see this being the next big thing in dance games.
2006170	2008692	I chalk this right up there with other classic...
2010828	2014171	Video games made for retail sales in Christian bookstores.
2014231	2016433	It makes me think of the Bible Trivia Game.
2016713	2018495	Like Bible Trivia Game and Noah's Ark.
2018575	2023860	Remember the old DDR parody that had the cross-shaped controller that had the two down arrows?
2024280	2025121	Oh, yeah.
2025761	2029845	I forgot what that was, but that was... Dance, Dance Resurrection.
2031486	2032047	Okay, whatever.
2032227	2032907	That was horrible.
2032927	2034189	You want to talk about another bad game?
2034689	2036911	They have the Friends Trivia Game we've got to sell.
2039059	2041322	I think I saw that for sale somewhere.
2041342	2041883	I heard about it.
2056784	2057365	Yeah.
2057405	2059026	Although she had nothing to do with friends.
2060067	2061308	No, no, no.
2061688	2066271	Her character, not Fran Drescher, but the character in it.
2067032	2068593	Oh, the one who was the girlfriend?
2068793	2069954	Yeah, I can't remember her name.
2069994	2070755	I don't watch the show.
2071215	2074398	The one who had the really annoying one.
2074418	2077640	Oh my god!
2078381	2080382	Seriously, our listeners are going to write hate mail for that.
2080522	2080823	Thank you.
2081243	2083404	Hey, I gotta answer it, so I better not.
2083744	2098189	Anyway, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game, go for it, but I don't think the quality of the game, since, let's face it, it is being put out by a much, much, much, much, much smaller company, I don't think it's gonna be that smooth a game, but whatever.
2098989	2099309	Have fun.
2101170	2101690	Any other emails?
2101970	2107852	Other than the one I mentioned about the controller, but we've addressed that.
2107912	2108292	Cool deal.
2108372	2109513	Alright, well, send us more mail.
2109593	2110273	We like getting mail.
2110473	2110793	Right, Jamie?
2111878	2112519	Yes, we do.
2112879	2114841	Send Jamie some email about how much you love her giggling.
2115481	2117303	Her incessant giggling on this program.
2117963	2120285	I am not a giggler.
2121146	2129032	To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm giggling now because I keep calling you a giggler.
2129152	2130934	I did find something cool internet related though.
2131034	2131334	Oh, what's that?
2131354	2132215	Just a really short thing.
2132535	2138440	For folks like me who like to use Firefox, there's a skin for it called Pimpzilla.
2139395	2144357	that makes your top toolbar all fuzzy and then the background behind your tab is all leopard print.
2144377	2146499	I just thought that people... Where can they download that?
2146999	2148239	Can we put a link on our site somewhere?
2149260	2150140	I'll hunt it down again.
2150621	2155623	But the font and all the buttons and everything look like they're straight out of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2155703	2156383	It's great.
2156443	2156744	Cute.
2157044	2158784	And they're all bling-shaped and everything.
2158845	2159145	It's cool.
2159345	2159585	Cute.
2160625	2161126	All right.
2161606	2163727	Let's get into some more gaming news.
2164407	2167229	One thing we mentioned earlier in the program was Katamari Damacy.
2167249	2167609	Yes.
2168362	2169823	Boku no Watashi no Katamari Damashii
2196437	2198918	Somebody told me it turns into My My Katamari Damacy.
2199058	2200098	Wait, wait, wait.
2200118	2200658	Read the title again.
2200999	2203659	Boku no Watashi no Katamari Damacy.
2203679	2205060	Yeah, My My Katamari.
2205640	2206460	So, whatever.
2207221	2207921	Yeah.
2208041	2209601	Boku no is like boy saying.
2209841	2211242	Atashi no is like girl saying.
2211582	2212382	Okay, okay.
2212642	2215963	So it sounds like it's little boys and girls saying are Katamari.
2216284	2218344	Not a whole lot known about this game just yet.
2218524	2220965	Wi-Fi support, though, is rumored to be in it.
2221205	2223226	Branching storylines like night and day.
2224006	2226007	and other kind of modes like that are going to be in it.
2226027	2227187	So that would be kind of cool to see.
2228107	2231028	So that's being shown at Tokyo Game Show.
2231088	2232569	I didn't hear if it was playable or not.
2232629	2233589	I just know it's being shown.
2233829	2234129	It was.
2234429	2234989	It was playable?
2235470	2241071	Yeah, there's actually people saying that the controls sucked on it.
2241632	2242832	Oh no!
2243572	2244813	You know it can't be that great.
2244833	2251455	Well, because you can't do dual analog, so what it is is it's the directional button and the four buttons are the two sticks.
2251495	2252655	I knew it would be like that.
2253132	2253892	That kind of sucks.
2253932	2262695	Well, the person that was looking at it was saying that they hoped that it would have been like the analog and turning with the shoulder buttons, which would be good.
2263875	2277860	It is, from what I remember on the plot for it, is that apparently there's some island that's in trouble that has animals on it or whatever, and you have to, you arrive there on a boat or something, and you have to save the animals or something by absorbing them.
2277960	2278880	By rolling them over?
2278900	2278980	Yeah.
2279640	2281321	I guess.
2281882	2282382	I guess.
2282522	2287245	I don't know, but that was what I had heard, and it was pretty interesting.
2287385	2289166	I don't know.
2289246	2291488	I'm all for Katamari coming to the PSP.
2292327	2292767	Interesting.
2292907	2293207	Hell yeah.
2293628	2298950	Alright, one other PSP story I definitely want to make sure we cover at some point, also being shown at the Tokyo Game Show.
2299410	2304012	You guys know that Suikoden 1 and 2, there are an absolute bitch to find.
2304052	2307573	I mean, you could be paying like $100 for a copy of Suikoden 2 on eBay.
2307953	2308593	Well, guess what?
2309234	2315116	They are both coming out again, together on the PSP, this being announced at Tokyo Game Show.
2315436	2320378	So, Suikoden fans, if you've been dying to play Suikoden 2 for a while, you just can't seem to get a copy of it,
2320678	2323781	It's going to be coming out for the PSP along with Suikoden 1.
2324381	2325342	So that's going to be pretty cool.
2325462	2329965	No estimated release on this, but probably not until next year at some point.
2330846	2334089	Again, this is only Japan so far, but heck, why not?
2334169	2335610	Should come out over here too, right?
2335730	2337591	Just a little bit of translation, right?
2338112	2338452	We'll see.
2339693	2341374	Loki, you got some gaming news for us?
2341474	2343296	I'm sorry, was something going on in the hack and crack scene?
2343516	2345117	Yeah, a couple things actually.
2345457	2348079	The first being that the rumored...
2349386	2376851	Team Extender, they're actually creating this video out for the PSP so you can watch your UMDs and everything on normal TV and they had a demo of it what this thing does and it looks like it's a whole case replace of it, you basically unscrew the case and pop this sucker on it has actually a port to plug in a DualShock controller so you can use that as the controller and then play your games on the TV that way
2377133	2377893	You know what's funny?
2378233	2380034	And this was even just last night.
2380634	2385875	I had gone back after my trip to Ikea and stopped by to see Dan at GameStop.
2385955	2388576	And I was saying, they should make a TV tuner for the PSP.
2388856	2392857	Well, wasn't it rumored that PS3 was going to have a UMD slot in it?
2393537	2397378	That was sort of a rumor, but I don't think it's going to happen.
2397918	2399499	That's what everyone was speculating.
2399519	2399699	It should.
2399719	2400079	It should.
2400929	2402210	It would make sense, but no.
2402431	2407956	I mean, think about it, though, especially with the success that they've been having with the movies, which is kind of odd to me.
2407996	2410498	I mean, I understand why they put movies on PSP, but I don't see why it's so successful.
2410538	2411579	It would make perfect sense.
2411859	2416003	Because then Sony could really compete with DVD, but they would have their own version.
2416966	2419608	I think it would be very smart to put it in there.
2419788	2420089	I know.
2420129	2430297	Because then they can have it, okay, you know, you can... If you buy this version of the movie, not only will you be able to play it on your TV, but you can also take it on the go with you.
2431958	2433359	It would be interesting.
2434300	2435921	It would be smart, but I don't think you're going to do it.
2436454	2441217	But, um, yeah, so this thing is actually being, um, I guess beta right now.
2441297	2445420	They're working out the kinks in it, but, um, from the screenshots I've seen, it looks good.
2445921	2450904	I'll have selectable, um, widescreen and pan and scan, you know, if you want to, like, fill your whole TV.
2451404	2452725	But, um, it should be cool.
2452925	2453966	I mean, um... Resolution issues?
2454987	2460130	I don't think so, but, um, of course it'll stretch it if, you know, you try to take it out of widescreen.
2460170	2463653	But, um, you know, hey, I'm all for modding my PSP, so...
2464663	2469408	I'm concerned about resolution when you get into larger high definition formats.
2469428	2471089	And how about support for widescreen TVs, huh?
2471830	2472331	I don't know.
2472351	2473532	I'm just saying.
2473612	2474833	Well, here's what it is.
2475153	2482140	Basically, if you want to get to the nitty gritty of this, the PSP already has a video out on it.
2482780	2483461	It's the USB.
2484482	2487485	Because when you're playing your games, the USB acts like a video out.
2488703	2491624	If you're very interested in trying to make one, you probably could.
2492504	2495585	All this thing is, is just adding some more support.
2495665	2499447	So, really, that USB port can be exploited to a lot.
2500207	2503768	Anyways, so other than this... You said the term nitty-gritty.
2505509	2506589	I know, and I'm sorry.
2506649	2508530	I instantly started thinking nitty-gritty derpy.
2508910	2516032	The other thing, I was going to say, was it... This site, P6, who's doing this kind of a new...
2517170	2524213	No, Graphic User Interface for the PSP, which looks pretty sexy, but still working out the kinks on that.
2524973	2533797	They actually have a tutorial here on how to, if you really want to mod your PSP, you can change all the menus what their titles are.
2533857	2538739	So you can make it UMD as in movie player, or you're
2541341	2544502	system settings as I fucked your mom or something like that.
2545242	2551164	So you can do whatever you want and there's a tutorial on their site and that's pretty interesting.
2551204	2556566	There's a link on PSP updates for that and on our site as well once we put it on there.
2557666	2559507	And yeah, that's pretty much it.
2559547	2566209	There's some really cool Tetris game that came out called Hack and you should check that out too.
2566229	2566989	It looks pretty cool.
2567269	2569010	The link we'll have on our page as well.
2570205	2573887	Dark Sakura, what kind of gaming news do you have for us tonight?
2599728	2600809	I've got a couple things.
2602290	2603631	About Final Fantasy, actually.
2603691	2604672	Dirge of Aseribus.
2604992	2605332	Oh, cool.
2606273	2610736	Been trying to hunt down a release date, because I want my hot Vincent action.
2611857	2617801	And it's speculated the date tentative in Japan is sometime in 2005.
2618001	2619422	No US release date yet.
2619842	2621523	Which means next summer.
2621904	2622164	Yeah.
2623118	2652010	but you know with every Final Fantasy game that's practically ever been out except for like what 4 when it came out we're going to get more stuff and they're going to release an international version and they're going to get more stuff and I'm going to have to import it and it's going to of course be in English so they better have someone hot do Vincent's voice anyway could you imagine great now I can't remember his name Boreanaz David Boreanaz doing Vincent's voice he's too busy doing Squall in Kingdom Hearts
2652972	2653753	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2672353	2676637	The Deep Ground Soldiers, who go underground after the meteor incident.
2676657	2677959	We all played Final Fantasy VII.
2679000	2680962	There's a Sahagin, Gargoyle.
2681582	2682623	Those are some of the things.
2682923	2693774	And of course, looking at a movie file, which Loki was kind enough to show me, it looks like it's going to be an over-the-shoulder perspective, sort of first-person shootery-ish movie.
2694861	2700308	But it actually sort of made me think a little bit like it's like Devil May Cry featuring Vincent.
2702850	2704312	That's not a bad thing, no.
2705033	2708557	But there better not be any freaking Aerith in it or I'll scream.
2708577	2709839	I hate her.
2711239	2733475	Also, speaking about the Final Fantasy VII franchise, I was reading an interview from our friends at 1UP.com with Tetsuya Nomura, who's, as we know, the director of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, stating that he very much wants to...
2735196	2740921	and sort of expand on the Final Fantasy VII tech demo and completely remake the game.
2741421	2742863	I've said this on previous podcasts.
2743403	2747287	I highly speculate it's already in the works and they're just keeping a real tight lid on it.
2747667	2750169	I think it's going to be a surprise at next year's E3.
2750509	2753252	But I don't know.
2753512	2754173	I might be wrong.
2755213	2755654	What can you do?
2756781	2762442	All we can do is wait, but I'll tell you, if it's out, I know which of those systems I'm getting first.
2763543	2764463	That's all there is to that.
2764803	2766243	Now what else is coming out for the PS3?
2766883	2767784	Remake of Gradius.
2769444	2771264	Oh, I heard, I had a story queued up on that.
2771304	2771885	You ruined it.
2771925	2772145	Oh, sorry.
2772165	2772665	That's alright.
2772745	2775986	No, it's a wonderful transition into your part.
2776926	2777966	Even though I have something else.
2778206	2778626	That's alright.
2778726	2779726	I'll get back to you here.
2779806	2781067	Let me get the story I have here.
2781107	2783687	I'll go cry in my little giggling ditzy corner.
2784027	2784768	Gradius.
2785928	2786348	Hee hee hee.
2787177	2793081	Gradius will be coming out on the PlayStation 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show.
2793861	2799244	There really isn't a whole lot else to say except Gradius is coming out in a brand new PlayStation 3 form.
2799785	2801045	What else is there to say?
2801305	2802006	It's Gradius.
2802166	2802946	It's PlayStation 3.
2803567	2804888	It's going to be very sexy.
2806068	2812732	Especially if some of the famous Konami musicians such as Akira Yamaoka or some of the other people they have there are doing the music for it.
2812912	2814313	It will be very sexy indeed.
2814673	2815234	Sign me up.
2815334	2815674	Thank you.
2817444	2822828	There's also speculation, according to Bloomberg.com, you know, financial blah, blah, blah.
2843072	2846674	that Konami and Capcom may be Japan's next big merger.
2846834	2847755	That would be weird.
2848495	2851937	And to quote my... It's so weird saying husband.
2852798	2853759	I'm so married now.
2854599	2857701	But he was saying, were they going to be called Capkonami?
2858742	2859362	Capkonami.
2860498	2861779	Oh, that would just be weird.
2861859	2862199	I don't know.
2862219	2864260	I don't see it happening.
2864580	2865000	I don't either.
2865100	2874444	But a lot of these companies, to do a quote in here from Takashi Oya, who's an analyst with Deutsche Securities in Tokyo.
2875085	2880207	So companies like Taito, Bandai, and Namco are not merging because they are facing financial ruin.
2880587	2884169	They're looking three years down the road and thinking this might be a strategic choice.
2884389	2884549	Hmm.
2885319	2890683	And if these big, you know, because Taito, Namco, all of those are really freaking huge.
2890743	2897247	I know, it's so weird that all these game companies are suddenly like, it's like they're forming into the giant Mechatron.
2897348	2901651	We have Sega Sammy, which is weird all in itself.
2901911	2903031	It can be very few.
2903252	2904953	But, I mean, honestly...
2905791	2906372	Mega Man, Castlevania, etc.
2923303	2924765	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2940515	2941996	I think that would be kind of weird.
2942057	2945440	There's another comment in here that sort of bugged me.
2945480	2947261	I'm just going to read this little paragraph here.
2947341	2948362	What's that?
2948543	2959453	Konami is trying to break its reliance on the video game business where earnings depend on hit titles and find new revenue sources by expanding into toys, sports club, arcade machinery, and casino businesses.
2959933	2971277	Which actually, you know, I saw a number of Konami-made slot machines when I was at the casino a couple weekends ago for my honeymoon.
2972357	2976039	And Konami has always been into fitness equipment.
2976059	2985042	I mean, they're even working on a mock-up of DDR to be used as a fitness, as basically automated aerobics machine.
2985222	2989365	Consolidation is gaining pace and music movie broadcasting companies and internet portals are possible partners.
3014565	3014965	Hmm.
3015585	3021327	So, yeah, looking at this from the business side, that actually does make a lot of sense.
3022267	3028669	And it's saying on here that the speculated target for Konami is Capcom.
3029609	3029949	Interesting.
3029969	3032110	Right now, Konami's number four, Capcom's number six.
3032190	3033210	It makes financial sense.
3033650	3034010	All right.
3034250	3034891	We'll see what happens.
3034911	3037131	That would be kind of... It would just be weird.
3037191	3037771	We'll see, though.
3037831	3038192	We'll see.
3039372	3043213	That would be like taking my heart and breaking it in two and putting it back together.
3045044	3045485	Why?
3045725	3048248	Because I love Konami and I love Capcom.
3049029	3052694	And seeing, you know, it's like having hamsters.
3053515	3062787	You know how if one of your hamsters feels like it's threatened, its babies are threatened, like its assets are threatened, it's going to go kill the other hamster and eat it.
3066505	3067025	It's true!
3067185	3068045	Hamsters do that.
3068325	3068986	I know, I know.
3069006	3071246	But I know it's not the best analogy.
3071986	3074567	But, you know, it's doggy dog.
3074627	3076907	In this case, it's, you know... Hamstreet hamster.
3076927	3078068	Hamstreet hamster.
3078428	3078848	Alright.
3079368	3080708	Anything else for us, DarkSakura?
3081509	3082469	Um, no.
3083009	3083289	Alright.
3083569	3084529	I like fire.
3085029	3085490	I know you do.
3086350	3086930	I know you do.
3087470	3090171	But that's when you truly giggle, is when you set things on fire.
3090551	3091311	Oh, yeah.
3091631	3092631	But only when they scream.
3093431	3095732	Um... Xenosaga...
3096934	3099702	Xenosaga is coming out to the Nintendo DS.
3100782	3129375	Xenosaga 1 and 2 specifically no it's not going to be the full blown 3D movie element that you see in Xenosaga no they're going to redo it all cutesy anime style in a 2D isometric type style but still that's kind of cool I mean to remake a game that was out on the Playstation 2 and just kind of like remake all the graphics and all the stuff behind it and it's still going to have cutscenes it's just going to be done differently well they're going to remake that into a DS title
3130021	3130962	Xenosaga 1 and 2.
3131042	3134166	That also coming out of Tokyo Game Show from Monolith Soft.
3135167	3136188	Should be very interesting.
3136728	3140652	Xenosaga Episode 3, by the way, is coming out for the PlayStation 2, if you were not aware.
3142374	3142695	All right.
3143956	3145558	Loki, did you have anything else for us tonight?
3145958	3148661	I saw you had a story up there, so I'm curious.
3149001	3152465	I'm just looking at some of the stuff that they've been showing at, you know,
3153157	3154358	DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
3172037	3177421	My favorite, though, is just some of the detailed shots that they've been showing for Metal Gear Solid 4.
3177501	3180063	Just the amount of detail that's in this is incredible.
3181323	3187668	The other game that looks really cool is the Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.
3188348	3190630	Some of the stuff in there actually looks like CNN footage.
3191010	3192891	That's how detailed it is.
3193852	3194092	Wow.
3195891	3203558	And also, what really scares me is they're talking about making a Lone and Dark for the PS3, so that might give Bowie Bowles some inspiration to make another movie.
3204399	3206841	We can't have that, so... I hope not.
3207282	3207542	Yeah.
3208563	3208863	Alright.
3209364	3211206	I got one more story for you guys tonight, then.
3212267	3216010	It's a brand new... This is usually the type of thing you talk about, Loki, but I'm stealing this from you tonight.
3216651	3216711	Um...
3217737	3220820	Recording video via your PSP.
3221080	3225243	A company called Hori is making a brand new PSP accessory.
3225824	3234051	Basically what it is, it's a little rectangle looking device and what it does is you can hook it up so that you can record video straight onto your memory stick.
3235011	3235872	So that's pretty much it.
3235892	3238294	You can record video using your PSP right onto your memory stick.
3238594	3242037	About $115 is what it's going to cost.
3242057	3245500	That's 12,800 yen coming out in November in Japan.
3245956	3246296	DarkSakura.com
3267933	3268974	on PSP.
3269654	3279244	But remember, if you're making adult films with your PSP, don't leave it where people are going to find it because they'll get put all over the internet like, you know, those celebrities like Pam Anderson and stuff.
3281286	3285050	On that note, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
3285130	3287312	Thank you guys so much for tuning in, subscribing to us.

3295303	3297885	Tee hee, tee hee, insert bad joke here.
3297925	3298325	That's right.

3313895	3314476	Final thoughts.
3314816	3315056	Loki.
3316667	3317087	JackThompson
3348255	3348635	It's funny.
3348915	3358182	There's a whole bunch of emails or fake emails I should say that are on the Liberty City Stories webpage so go check those out as well.
3360424	3366829	My final thought is I'm still craving a milkshake now that you both had them during the three hour program earlier this evening and I didn't.
3367369	3369511	I'm suffering for it.
3370212	3370572	Not really.
3371172	3372153	DarkSakura, your final thought.
3373600	3375001	Two sort of final thoughts.
3375101	3375922	I'm correcting myself.
3376403	3382569	It wasn't police knots that had the mini RC looking metal gear like Otacon was using.
3382869	3387374	It was Snatcher, which is another Kojima game that was on Sega CD.
3388255	3388895	Good luck finding it.
3390197	3391037	And your second final thought?
3391258	3392038	Reject false icons.
3392199	3392479	Of course.
3393806	3395367	I'm going to go ditz my way off now.
3395567	3395927	All right.
3395987	3396607	Have fun with that.
3396847	3402290	And from us to you, have a great day, afternoon, or evening whenever you're listening to this.
3402310	3404271	And we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio To Go.
3405972	3409553	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
