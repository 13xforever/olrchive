That should be a lot of fun.

6
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,600
Also, a lot of news from the Tokyo Game Show, including that wacky new Nintendo controller.

7
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:26,840
Surely you've heard something about it.

8
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,520
And of course we have not forgotten about our roots, DeRoots, where we came from, the

00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,640
Bimani world, did you hear, brand new Guitar Freaks home release, finally, we're going

00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,440
...bluh-uh-bluh-tra-bluh-caw-key!

20
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,280
Just kidding, Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

21
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,280

Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

32
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:22,200
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers, better known as Dark Sakura.

33
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,200
How are you?

34
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,200
Who farted?

35
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,200
That was Loki, sir.

36
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,200
Oh, all right. How are you?

37
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:29,200
Am I on?

38
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,200
Yes, you're on.

39
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,200
Is this thing on?

40
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,200
We'll know I'm all tangled up under all those other masses of cords.

41
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,200
You have an old wireless router?

42
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,200
Yes.

43
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:06,200
Heck, maybe I'll take it. I need one.

44
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,200
So I can get back on Xbox Live.

45
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,200
I can get back on Xbox Live.

46
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:12,200
You can get that thing that Straight Garret has.

47
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,200
Maybe. Alright.

48
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,200
I haven't introduced you yet, so shut up.

49
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,200
Alright.

50
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,200
Also joining us tonight.

51
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,200
Hey! We are still in the middle of my intro. Thank you.

52
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,200
Sorry. What else do you want to intro with tonight?

53
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,200
Usually I thought that was my...

54
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:56,940
I have a question I'm dying to ask you that was posted on the forums this week, so we'll

55
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:01,580
get to that a little later in the show okay all right just that's all I just

56
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,860
was thinking about that and in regards to your rampant piracy so I downloaded

57
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:11,660
Advent Children in Spanish by accident

58
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:26,020
Oi! okay I don't know why that's so funny it is all right also joining us tonight

59
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:30,020
Say hello to special guest, he already opened his mouth, but once again, say hello to Bugz.

60
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,020
Hello.

61
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,020
You're back.

62
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:33,020
Yes.

63
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,020
This means you like it.

64
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:36,020
And the specialist guest of them all.

65
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,020
Okay.

66
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:43,180
He's almost like, he's not, I mean, we already have a Tech Massa Loki, but Bugz is kind of

67
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:46,540
a tech guy too, so I don't know what we can call him.

68
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:50,180
I don't know, he's Tech Massa 2 or something, I don't know.

69
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,700
Diet Tech Massa, I don't know.

70
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,700
Mac Whore.

71
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,700
Mac Whore.

72
00:06:53,700 --> 00:06:54,700
I like that.

73
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,900
I know bigger MacHores than Bugd.

74
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,700
Yes, but how many MacHores have a G4 motherboard in the middle of their living room right now?

75
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:08,700
I remember you, sir, used to have a, well you still do, you have a web server that hangs from the ceiling, right?

76
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,300
No, actually it's inside of a rolling rack. It's still hanging.

77
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,800
Oh, it used to hang from the ceiling.

78
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
It did hang from the ceiling, yes.

79
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:20,900
It's pretty awesome. I used to go like, hey, the old Sacramento Bamani site used to be you hosted on Neil's ceiling.

80
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,900
Pretty awesome.

81
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,900
That got moved into the inside of a wire rack, so it was zip-tied between layers of wire rack.

82
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,900
Zip ties.

83
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,900
Zip ties is the second best thing next to duct tape.

84
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:35,900
Duct tape and weed whacker line, that's what I had available.

85
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,900
It was really strange.

86
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,900
Were you a Boy Scout?

87
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:42,900
No, my brother was.

88
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:46,900
I bet you watched lots of MacGyver.

89
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900
Who says I ever stop?

90
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:50,900
Don't they show reruns of MacGyver still?

91
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,900
Two a day.

92
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,900
Not that my TiVo doesn't get both.

93
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,900
He was! He was a fucking treehugger! But he was the most ingenious treehugger that was.

94
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:29,900
So, um, gotta give him props for that.

95
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
But he would cut down a tree and then make paper out of it.

96
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:36,900
They should just put MacGyver in Stargate. Just make him a character.

97
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,900
And I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, we can't get the Stargate working.

98
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,900
Well, look, give me a paperclip. No.

99
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:49,900
This sci-fi network needs to just bring back all the cool 80s shows, like MacGyver, Quantum Leap, Holla, Airwolf!

100
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,140
quantum leaves on every night at 4 a.m.

101
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:55,740
so badass, alright anyway let's start a show, let's talk about some games

102
00:08:55,740 --> 00:09:00,780
we'll be back after this quick break, featuring, starting off a brand new track from the

103
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,020
V-Rare, the EX2 V-Rare, it's You Gotta Move It

104
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,020
Enjoy. We'll be back after this.

105
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:45,020
Let the music fill your soul, let your body take control

106
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:29,780
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

107
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,780
Let's go!

108
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Let's go!

109
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
Let's go!

110
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:40,780
After this song, we'll be hearing some of your favorite songs.

111
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:11,420
having a let them move marathon. Just kidding. Orange Lounge Radio, crap free

112
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,160
Bovani radio. We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 156. Thank you guys

113
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:21,380
so much for tuning in and listening to this train wreck of a program. We do appreciate

114
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:26,460
your support. Especially when our show is very, very good as well as when our show is

115
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:30,820
very, very bad. We appreciate your support. We're never bad. And shows like Tonight, which

116
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:36,180
you're destined to be very, very mediocre. We're never bad. We're never mediocre either.

117
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:41,460
We're bad at some good. You know, like, oh, the power glove. So bad. You know, like that.

118
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:48,540
We're fabulous, as always. That's right. With the power of Fiji water. What is up with Fiji

119
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,020
water? It's like everywhere now. Like, it used to be, like, I never saw Fiji water anywhere.

120
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:56,020
It's the only water that doesn't suck. I like, well, I actually don't like this arrowhead

121
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:59,880
stuff I've been drinking lately. That stuff tastes like piss. I don't like this arrowhead

122
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:06,160
drinking water and people go like dude first off you buy bottled water what's

123
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,840
wrong with you is like the first thing I hear and then it's like no no you don't

124
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,880
understand there really is a difference between all these different brands of

125
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,280
bottled water and you can taste it you can if you if you drink a lot of water

126
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,920
like I do I drink a shoot load of water I don't know why I'm censoring myself

127
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:27,640
tonight a shoot load of water every day at work I could I could say shitload it's

128
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:35,040
the internet but tonight I'm centering myself a shootload of a poo-load of water every day

129
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:38,920
at work because my job, my day job, I don't talk about my day job a whole lot on this

130
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:44,240
program but my day job is that I'm a teacher basically. I don't teach kids but I teach

131
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,960
adults in a professional environment. I'm a corporate teacher.

132
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,640
Which is almost the same thing.

133
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:54,000
Sometimes. I'm not going to knock my job. I love my job but let's just say that there's

134
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:57,140
challenges that come with teaching children and there's challenges that come with teaching

135
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:01,860
adults so I'm a corporate trainer and so I do a lot of talking you know pretty

136
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,820
much eight hours a day minus lunch and breaks so you know I have to drink a lot

137
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,460
of water or my voice goes and if I did lunches and breaks Rob duct tapes his

138
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,660
mouth shut I seriously try not to talk during lunches and breaks to give myself

139
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,180
a rest and I just drink tons and tons of water because that's the only way I can

140
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:22,180
prevent my voice from going out I should drink more tea but I can only stand

141
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,380
drink so much tea and my favorite tea is dehydrating is it yep but it's good for

142
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:33,100
your throat hot tea hot tea is like if you already have like sinus sandwiches

143
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:37,420
and stuff see that's the problem is that my favorite kind of tea is iced tea and

144
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:41,180
not just any kind of iced tea the iced green tea is like my favorite kind of

145
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,540
tea but you can't find that anywhere like the only time I ever found iced

146
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:50,300
green tea in a bottle was in New York City at a random ride aid in Grand

147
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:55,280
Central Station was the only place I've ever seen no did it is do they have

148
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,900
green tea yes they don't sell that flavor at my work thing cuz they have

149
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:05,380
so be at my work but not that flavor so be and Lipton okay Lipton is the one

150
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:09,540

154
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:29,860
but I don't care um Lipton like green tea that's diet or something so I have

161
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:01,540
up. I actually don't like Arizona green tea for some reason. I don't like that. I think

162
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:05,420
diet green tea is pretty good. I didn't like Arizona tea. That's why I neglected to mention

163
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,940
it, so. Well, I'm glad. So how about video games? Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm glad there's tea

164
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:13,300
connoisseurs in our chat room as well yeah how about video games you should

165
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:16,540
play less of them you know what I actually drink more tea you want to know

166
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,700
where I get my tea from where I get it from these little bags that I brew in

167
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:25,620
hot water myself and then ice it if I want it cold yeah you you made me tea

168
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:29,660
the other day when I was visiting we had some 2d x and tea yes I did it was like

169
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:33,300
a British thing we had a little 2d accent hey you had some of my southern

170
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:41,540
style iced tea oh a little bit of southern style then okay I see I have a

171
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:48,240
range of horrible accents that need to be heard on this show anyway um let's

172
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,300
see so we are gonna start off tonight's show doing a little bit of how was your

173
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:55,020
week how was your day and we'll start off with the one in the dark Sakura how

174
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,720
was your week I had I had with sick all week on Monday okay you know I fell

175
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:06,220
sleep during the show right during one of our breaks you fell asleep during

176
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,820
one of our breaks I don't know if you happen to notice I was curled up

177
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,540
sideways on the humongoid chair uh-huh I don't remember you falling asleep

178
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:16,860
actually dozed off I remember you being really out of it but I don't know see

179
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:22,140
earlier that day I had slept for 13 hours came back from my wedding thing

180
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:28,340
and just crashed and didn't get up until 3 the next day well Monday I get up and

181
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:35,340
go to work. I go back home, go to the doctor, go to the chiropractor. I'm exhausted. Next

182
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:41,460
day I sleep for another 13 hours. I'd called in, thankfully. Got up, took a shower, sat

183
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:44,900
down for a moment. Next thing I knew, three more hours had passed. No, four more hours

184
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:50,540
had passed, and I was just waking up again. Went to work the next day, fell asleep twice

185
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:57,540
at work. So yeah. You can get away with falling asleep at work? Yep. That's awesome. Barely.

186
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
My job doesn't work.

187
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,540
I knew I was sick though, so they didn't care.

188
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:04,540
I can't fall asleep. Everybody's looking at me, so I can't just suddenly go,

189
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:08,540
Okay, class, you work on this exercise, and I'm going to crawl under the table and take a nap.

190
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Remember, take off the bunny ears when you get to work.

191
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,540
Okay.

192
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Okay.

193
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
Then they won't look at you.

194
00:22:15,540 --> 00:22:17,540
That was one of the big pluses to being the boss in a warehouse,

195
00:22:17,540 --> 00:22:23,540
was sending your minions out to do something and then go crash in the back office for a couple hours while they finish it up.

196
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:26,540
You guys seriously sleep at work?

197
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:28,540
Well, if I was at work, yes.

198
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
Sometimes.

199
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:31,540
I'd take two, three, four hour lunches.

200
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Wait.

201
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Bug, you've fallen asleep at work.

202
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,540
Uh, yeah.

203
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,540
I used to work nights.

204
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I'd sleep half the night.

205
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:38,540
Darksucker, you've obviously fallen asleep at work.

206
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Loki, have you ever slept at work?

207
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Okay, so it's not to never slept at work.

208
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
I've never slept at work either.

209
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:48,540
But to my credit, I've only fallen asleep at work when I was sick, and they knew that

210
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
I was sick.

211
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,540
I'm afraid of getting caught.

212
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:53,540
Like, that's the kind of thing that I don't want to have.

213
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
My boss was 13 miles away.

214
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,000
I don't want to have that conversation with my boss if I get caught like falling asleep

215
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:04,380
Because I'm not in class every day so feasibly I could easily like

216
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:08,340
Go back go into the go into the room turn off the lights. What?

217
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:14,840
We lean over with your hand over your eyes with your pen in your hand

218
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,420
Everybody's taking notes, right? Oh

219
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:27,420
Oh my gosh, so you've never really been caught except the one time you were sick?

220
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,420
No, I've never been caught.

221
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,420
I got caught once.

222
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,420
I've just only done it when I was sick.

223
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:34,420
Oh my gosh, what happened when you got caught?

224
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,420
They asked me why I was asleep. I said I was asleep.

225
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,420
Shit happened the night before I didn't sleep well.

226
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,420
I was tired?

227
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,420
Exactly.

228
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,420
Did you get written up?

229
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:49,420
I don't remember. They fired my boss the next day.

230
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:54,640
Oh, lucky you.

231
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,760
It was really odd because the owner of the company I work for also owned another company

232
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,360
that we were doing contract work with.

233
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,360
It was like a whole big old conflict of interest shit.

234
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:08,340
It's a good old ISP, JPSNet.

235
00:24:08,340 --> 00:24:12,920
The data center was located in downtown SAC, and everyone else was up in Rockland.

236
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:18,400
I was the only person in downtown SAC, and I went into the server room and crashed out.

237
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,320
And then the other company brought people through on a tour, and I was sitting there

238
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:23,320
snoring away.

239
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:27,080
Hypothetically, in my job, I could easily, easily sneak into one of the training rooms

240
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:30,260
when there's no class going on, turn off the lights, crawl on the table, and go to sleep.

241
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,140
And people would just think, I'm somewhere else.

242
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,220
I could do it.

243
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,860
But it's one of those things, like...

244
00:24:35,860 --> 00:24:36,860
Paranoia.

245
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,860
Exactly.

246
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:43,120
I work out of paranoia, because it's one of those things where I know that the first time

247
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,760
I ever did something like that, I'd get caught.

248
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:52,880
It's just like, there's this great scene in the movie Clerks where the people working

249
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:56,460
decided they're too lazy to work, so they're just sitting down behind the counter and they

250
00:24:56,460 --> 00:25:02,460
have a little jar out filled with coins and dollar bills saying, please take exact change.

251
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:08,320
And somebody comes in and asks, aren't you afraid of somebody stealing all the money?

252
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:11,100
And they say, no, because if you have the money out like that, people assume there's

253
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
a camera on it.

254
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:17,340
It's Honesty by Paranoia.

255
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,340
And I kind of compare that.

256
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:20,260
See, Loki I see is kind of nodding his head.

257
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:24,100
Is that the same thing for you, is that you're afraid you're going to get caught?

258
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:29,140
I couldn't, in the work I do, I couldn't even begin to try to fall asleep.

259
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,140
Me neither.

260
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:34,580
There's just too many people around me that would wake me up.

261
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:38,420
Usually when I have a project, it's due five minutes from now, so it's like I don't have

262
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:45,420
time to nap. I wish I could though. I've been working for this company since 2000 and honestly

263
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:51,820
I can count, you know, the number of times it's happened and it's all been when I was

264
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:56,820
sick or had like a migraine. Migraine surgery. See that's the thing. And it was always my

265
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:01,540
monitor that gave me my headaches. Same reason why I can't look at a TV and your monitor

266
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:07,060
would give me a headache. Because it's got a rounded screen. Oh, I'm actually going to

267
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:18,060
I have no reason to replace my monitor at home because it's a full sized monitor but it's a flat screen trinitron.

268
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:21,060
My monitor is pretty nice.

269
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,060
His monitor wouldn't make me sick.

270
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,060
I understand mine. Mine's kind of a weird monitor, but I can't complain because my monitor was free. Thank you, Bugged. Thank you. Appreciate it.

271
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:33,060
Does it still have the green stripes on the top?

272
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:38,060
I don't know, maybe. But I decorated it with all these stickers. See, I have stickers from E3.

273
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:44,060
The reason there's green stripes on the top is because it was in the trunk of my car during a car accident.

274
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
It's amazing the damn thing still works.

275
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:49,060
It was facing out towards the back.

276
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:50,060
Anyway.

277
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,060
About my week.

278
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:53,060
Yeah, sorry. We got on that little tangent there.

279
00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:14,060
I play puppies, and Dan brought home another MMORPG, and he brought home some like, he brought home Ico, which I never remembered him liking that game, but he said that he wanted to play it, and I went to IKEA yesterday with my friend Tia, you know Tia?

280
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:16,060
Of course I know Tia, she's a doll.

281
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:20,860
I had owed her a birthday present, so I just took her to Ikea and got her, like,

282
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,680
a bunch of stuff for her house. And her new kitty.

283
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:30,320
Huh? And her new kitty. Oh, that's right, she has a cat now.

284
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,520
I don't remember about the cat.

285
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,640
But we went and picked up my friend,

286
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,280
Christa, who lives in Berkeley. And we

287
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:50,480
ate really good Indian food, went on to IKEA, had meatballs, bought stuff, came back, and

288
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,520
did anybody go, that's a spicy meatball?

289
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,000
These are Swedish meatballs, they're not Swedish.

290
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
Yeah, Swedish, not Italian.

291
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000
Sorry.

292
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:00,000
And then, um.

293
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
There was no Mario.

294
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:06,800
And then we, um, went to get gelato at this one place in Berkeley that's, like, got a

295
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:07,800
bajillion flavors.

296
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:08,800
I love.

297
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,800
It's, like, Naya or something.

298
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,640
There's a gelato place right by IKEA that is awesome.

299
00:28:13,640 --> 00:28:14,640
I've been there before.

300
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,640
We just went to Berkeley.

301
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:19,280
They had like a billion, they had like fig flavor and they had amaretto and all kinds

302
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:20,280
of liquor flavors.

303
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,480
They had aloe vera flavored.

304
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,480
Aloe vera flavored?

305
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:25,520
Which is actually supposed to be pretty good.

306
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:26,520
And I...

307
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:27,520
I don't want to rub it on my sunburn.

308
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,520
Well, aloe vera is actually really good for your digestion.

309
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:37,400
But I had whole grain flavor, which was really yummy.

310
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:45,020
tasted like cereal and milk. I had this like milk flavor with dark chocolate

311
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:49,220
sprinkles in it or not sprinkles but like swivels in it but it was all hard

312
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:53,860
you know and I am amaretto which had real amaretto in it which is so yummy

313
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:01,500
and drove back and we watched Ring 2 last night the US one which is yeah and

314
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:11,500
And then I installed the MMORPG today after doing my Illustrator homework, which I will show the chat room what I did because I'm so proud that I finally got the freaking pen tool right.

315
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:16,500
But I got an MMORPG today and installed it and played it.

316
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:19,500
Pretty cool. So we're going to save that for a little later?

317
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:22,500
I don't see what's the big deal, but I'm going to let the chat room guess what it is.

318
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:23,500
Okay. Sounds good.

319
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Probably half of them are on my friend's list in LiveJournal.

320
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,500
I already know.

321
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,500
Yeah.

322
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,500
Alright.

323
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:34,100
Moving on. Bug, do you have the mic? How was your week? How was your day?

324
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:39,860
My week was filled with games. Because after Sunday night when we found that Target was

325
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:45,160
selling stuff early, I happened to go over to the local, the only Target in the county,

326
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:49,640
and sure enough they were selling We Love Katamari, and picked that up, and then sold

327
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:54,320
back a bunch of games on Wednesday and picked up Burnout 4, had a couple bucks left over,

328
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:59,360
and also picked up Nintendogs. And then I found out that my DS's sound system is completely

329
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:05,560
dead. So I've never heard my dog, but it hears me. So it's a mute dog.

330
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:10,080
Now, just a follow-up to last week's show. For those of you guys that weren't listening

331
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:15,320
last week, there was this big thing. Somebody had called us on Skype. Was it Ron Chan, I

332
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:20,000
think, called us on Skype and said that he had heard something on the internet that Target,

333
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:24,600
there was a Target in some area that was selling We Heart Katamari early. So I don't know where

334
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:28,960
this idea came from. We just said, well, because it was going back and forth, like, oh, no,

335
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,560
Photoshop or yeah they were selling it early so we said we'll just freaking

336
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,920
call them and see if they have one in stock and sure enough when we called

337
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,640
them we all were kind of I think at least I know when I was calling them I

338
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,400
was expecting the guy to say no we don't have that game or to know nothing about

339
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,080
it but we kind of got surprised because when we called the target NASA guy he

340
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,480
said yeah there's one left on the shelf so that kind of started this whole like

341
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:55,720
oh shit wave of oh shit call target what the hell's going on so sure enough but

342
00:30:55,720 --> 00:31:00,440
you had you now you found a copy of We Heart Kata Mari and bought it and I went

343
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,640
to now one of the Target stores you called on break was the one in

344
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:08,240
Roseville right not that far from Golf Land right so now I actually went out

345
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,880
there Tuesday and asked if they had any We Heart Kata Mari they didn't see any

346
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:14,960
other shelf and I asked because they said when you call them they were gonna

347
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,360
put them out on the shelves that Tuesday right right they didn't and the guy said

348
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:21,960
no we don't have that game like he almost he knew what I was trying to do

349
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:26,080
so I think some of the target employees caught on because somehow there was this

350
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,920
whole underground wave on the internet like check target check target none of

351
00:31:30,920 --> 00:31:34,480
the major gaming sites picked this up none of them picked it up that that we

352
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:39,220
hard cut Amari got leaked early but somehow it was spreading on the on the

353
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:42,500
down low and I'd like to think we had something to do with that Loki yeah you

354
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:47,760
see here's what happened with the whole Tuesday thing apparently what happened

355
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,760
And then once this Namco accidentally one of the shipments got sent out.

356
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,760
They knew who exactly to that those got shipped to.

357
00:31:54,760 --> 00:32:02,760
And so when they found out, thanks to me, Mr. Snitch, that stores had leaked it,

358
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:08,760
they got on the phone and they reprimanded people that, you know.

359
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,760
Really? Now this is an email that you wrote to Namco to get a response from.

360
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
This is a head of sales from Namco.

361
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,760
So thank you for ruining our time, you bastard.

362
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:23,760
It's only a couple copies that were leaked. You probably, everyone already bought those copies. I mean, we're talking like one shipment, one box.

363
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,760
I think Namco downplayed it to you.

364
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,760
How did one box go to at least five targets?

365
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:33,760
Exactly, across the nation. I think Namco downplayed what happened. I think it was one pallet.

366
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:37,760
And you know what a pallet is, is a pallet is like a big ol' thing of boxes.

367
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,220
The stores, though, that had the advanced copies, at least three of them were in California.

368
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:47,540
There was another one in the center of the country, another one on the East Coast.

369
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:48,540
Yeah, we know there was one in Kansas.

370
00:32:48,540 --> 00:32:52,120
So, you know, speculate what you want, but this is straight from the head of, you know,

371
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:53,120
sales at Namco.

372
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,360
Of course, piano corporations are full of bullshit.

373
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,480
I understand that, but I think they were BSing you in your response.

374
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,400
I think that they were trying to downplay what happened.

375
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,400
Yeah, guess what?

376
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,320
They actually released some more games that haven't even come out yet.

377
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:06,480
NamcoX, Capcom, it's in stores right now.

378
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,480
Is it?

379
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:13,480
No, it's not. I'm just saying.

380
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:20,480
They may say whatever they want to, but we've got irrefutable proof that they lied.

381
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Chat room comments. Let's see, comments about Loki.

382
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,480
Loki, you fucking narc. Snitch, you whore.

383
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,480
You're a mean one, Mr. Snitch. You piece of shit, Loki. You ruined Christmas.

384
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:35,480
You whore slut. You ruined Hanukkah. Honky ass bitch.

385
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,480
Okay, let me put it this way. Those games would be on the store shelves anyways, and they would have already been bought up, okay?

386
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:47,480
And if they weren't already, then you know what? Don't blame me, because it's those retarded people who put out in the first place.

387
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:52,480
So, you shouldn't even have your game yet, so shut up. That's what I have to say about that.

388
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,480
And a related note, I actually have to play Wii Heart Katamari today, thank you both.

389
00:33:55,480 --> 00:34:00,480
Guys, if you really want your stupid game early, go fucking pirate it off the internet like everybody else does.

390
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:12,480
and save yourself the $40. That's what it's really about, is that you don't want people stepping on your territory of the rampant BitTorrent piracy ring or whatever.

391
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
Fuck that, BitTorrent was last week, man. It's all about news groups.

392
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:19,480
News groups are older than old and never went away.

393
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Um, I don't see what the whole big deal is, because if we wanted it bad enough early, we would have just imported it, you know?

394
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:35,480
Like some of us did. I didn't do it, because I had better things to spend my money on. I already played it.

395
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,480
We played it at E3!

396
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:45,480
I know, and the E3 one worked, but here's my thing, is that I don't understand Japanese at all, and I'm not going to learn it.

397
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,480
You know what? I know 30 kanji, which isn't enough to read all the dialogue in that game.

398
00:34:50,480 --> 00:35:00,480
So, it doesn't matter. The king of all cosmos is going to say something fabulous, this package is going to rule the world, and you're going to roll a bunch of shit up in a big ball, big whoop, what's new.

399
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,480
Fine. Besides, Burnout 4 came out and that was more important.

400
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Alright, I want to let Bugd finish what was going on with his week. However, I do want to end on one note here.

401
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:15,480
Legend of Zaku says, remember Loki, snitches get stitches for being bitches.

402
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,480
Just remember that.

403
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:21,480
Bugd, how was the rest of your week?

404
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,480
Burnout 4 is also awesome.

405
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:28,480
And that was pretty much my damn week.

406
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,480
All right, Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

407
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:34,480
My week started off good.

408
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Well, first off, I had, you know, Advent Children like the hour after the show ended.

409
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,480
I had to watch it. Actually, I had to watch it, but I didn't get to watch it.

410
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,480
Instead, I watched most of the action sequences over the course of the week until Wednesday.

411
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:59,480
And that's when I got Burnout Revenge. And then we just crashed through cars the rest of the week.

412
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:04,480
And then I finally got to watch Advent Children today, the entire thing.

413
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:11,480
And I don't know why Sony is not putting this in theaters. It's like 100% better than a lot of this shit out there.

414
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:13,480
Even though it has no plot?

415
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:19,480
It has a plot. And if you pay attention to the plot, you would know that.

416
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:29,480
No, I watched the whole thing all the way through the first time I watched it, and I actually could follow the dialogue without subtitles, and the plot was so weak you could see right through it.

417
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:42,480
Okay. Miss Bitter, just call her a bitch. Fucking bitch! Now call him a bastard. Call him a fucking asshole, come on.

418
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Hey, you stop it there!

419
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:47,480
Well, I like to think that I'm an adult, thank you.

420
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:52,040
all one i'm not soft to pet lana

421
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:55,340
they without knowing that he really kickass uh...

422
00:36:55,340 --> 00:37:00,380
plot or not i mean come on i mean it better than that we bullshit i mean

423
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,260
now look he does have a point at least i didn't have a raise in it

424
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,180
at and

425
00:37:05,180 --> 00:37:08,180
i haven't even watched it yet i have to say he doesn't have a point it wasn't

426
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,900
directed by you evil

427
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,220
ideas

428
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,880
without spoiling anything

429
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,060
there it is true

430
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:20,660
there was a plot however it was highly transparent and very obvious from the

431
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:21,660
beginning

432
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:26,120
so i don't let much better that it's i can be in it for the family of all of

433
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,660
those was a pretty

434
00:37:27,660 --> 00:37:29,400
or yeah i was pretty

435
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,000
uh... and

436
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,920
and then i'm going to pay them off

437
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,800
microphone okay

438
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,720
right and i think that

439
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:43,120
uh... but yeah it

440
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:45,840
it was very i did not think it was bad at all

441
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,280
But it did have a really weak plot, I'm sorry.

442
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,700
Which was better? Advent Children or Spirits Within?

443
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:56,160
Well, Spirits Within I can't really call Final Fantasy because it wasn't, number one, it wasn't a game.

444
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
Number two didn't feel like it. It's basically,

445
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:01,640
Hi, this is really pretty CG by Square.

446
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:04,320
And that's what they should have called the movie and I bet it would have done better.

447
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,560
And it was a good movie on its own. It just wasn't Final Fantasy.

448
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,620
It was. It was just like the bouncer. Hi, this is a pretty game by Square.

449
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,060
They should have just marketed it

450
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:19,280
not a final passing movie as you know pretty cd all the spirit alien five

451
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,400
alien five

452
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,320
you know they're gonna probably make something like that anyway sorry you're

453
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,160
weak in your day

454
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,140
anyway

455
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:31,000
however that uh... didn't do a whole lot of just uh... try to play some of the

456
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,320
games

457
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:35,280
uh... almost got to play uh...

458
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,760
graffiti kingdom

459
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,720
you know i bought the lake weeks ago

460
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:41,220
uh...

461
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:46,220
But yeah, I've got a bunch of games I'm trying out, so like Urban Reign, it's going to be sweet.

462
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:52,220
They actually have, what is it, Paul Phoenix in Law from Tekken 5 in it, or Tekken, the series I guess.

463
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:53,220
Oh cool.

464
00:38:53,220 --> 00:38:57,220
Which is kind of neat. But yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on.

465
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:59,220
Alright, very cool.

466
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,220
My week and my day, you know, I just kind of worked a lot this week.

467
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:06,220
Kind of mellow, I didn't do a whole lot of anything that exciting.

468
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,220
You know, no exciting trips or anything like that.

469
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:13,220
Saturday was especially boring. I had a 7 hour marathon on Final Fantasy XI.

470
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:18,220
Oh my god, I will never play Final Fantasy XI that long again.

471
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:23,220
And Loki will be pleased to know another mission was accomplished without you.

472
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:27,220
I keep trying to play and god damn it the woman keeps pulling me away.

473
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:31,220
But at least this time it was for good reason. She got her fucking car finally.

474
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:35,220
I'm not driving around anymore. I'm done driving an hour or two hours a day.

475
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:37,220
Driving Miss Nellie?

476
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:47,220
Alright, so I'm done with that. Thank God. I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to Final Fantasy XI. It's friggin' hard. There's too much stuff I have to do.

477
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:49,220
We can still help you with it.

478
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:57,220
I really, I need to, I want to be able to sit down Saturdays and just play, or set a day to play, but it's just not working out that way.

479
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:03,220
I can't do a marathon like that on that game ever again. It was so exhausting.

480
00:40:03,220 --> 00:40:12,220
When I was unemployed, I played Ragnarok for a total of, what was it, 38 hours straight.

481
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:16,220
Oh my lord. No, I have some days off here.

482
00:40:16,220 --> 00:40:17,220
I didn't sleep.

483
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,220
Oh my gosh, you people are sick. I can't play a video game that long.

484
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:24,220
Although I have done several days straight staying logged in because I would bend at night.

485
00:40:24,220 --> 00:40:27,220
And while I was at work, when I started working.

486
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:47,220
So the rest of my week and my day, pretty much, I picked up, I'm going to talk about some of these games on the podcast, but I also picked up a copy of Mortal Kombat, Shaolin Monks, because it was a game that I played at E3 that I liked, surprising a lot more than I thought I would.

487
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:49,220
Wait, wait, hold on. You picked up that game?

488
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Yeah.

489
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:51,220
From where?

490
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,220
Best Buy. Why?

491
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:55,220
It doesn't come out until next week!

492
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,220
It came out early. It's on GameStop's site as being out now, too.

493
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,220
Eh, fucking GameStop.

494
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:05,220
So, did I really get a... I didn't get a copy of Mortal Kombat Shell Monks early.

495
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,220
It's out everywhere, isn't it?

496
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,220
No.

497
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,220
Really?

498
00:41:09,220 --> 00:41:10,220
I don't think so.

499
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,220
I think so.

500
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,220
Look at GameStop's site. It says it came out last week.

501
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,220
Well, GameStop's wrong.

502
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,220
Alright, well...

503
00:41:18,220 --> 00:41:20,220
I'll have to check into that, because...

504
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,220
You gonna snitch on them, too? You gonna snitch on Best Buy now?

505
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:30,860
No, that means that our Dallas facility is wrong and no, no, I don't I really don't care

506
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:37,780
You know cuz I'm not buying the game. So what do I give a shit about? Well, whatever but I you know, I I

507
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:42,060
Kind of like Mortal Kombat. I've it's been one of those games. Like I'm always like

508
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,820
you know

509
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:51,780
It's it's like the Spice Girls, you know, you don't want to admit you like the Spice Girls

510
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,760
But yet you know somebody must have because they sold what like 10 million copies of their album

511
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
Did the movie have meatloaf in it?

512
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,720
Yes

513
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,940
Anyway, so I like Mortal Kombat. I think it's got a pretty interesting story to it and the game's actually kind of fun

514
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:10,020
So I'm gonna talk about that, but it does have flaws. I'll talk about that on the podcast

515
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,360
Otherwise not a whole lot else to my week. I've been pretty boring. I haven't done anything that special so that's me

516
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:20,340
Oh by the way, I watched the movie birth last night that movie sucks

517
00:42:20,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Wait, is that the one when Nicole Kidman fucking a 12-year-old or something?

518
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:26,340
She doesn't fuck a 12-year-old. It's a 10-year-old, for one.

519
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:26,340
Okay.

520
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:33,340
And she doesn't fuck him. She does take a bath with him, and, or I should say he gets in the bath with her.

521
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:37,340
And, uh, she kisses him, and that's about it.

522
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:38,340
Ew!

523
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:39,340
But it was fucking boring.

524
00:42:39,340 --> 00:42:41,340
Ew, does that have tongue?

525
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,340
I guess.

526
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:42,340
Ew!

527
00:42:42,340 --> 00:42:54,340
Yes, it doesn't show it, but, okay, so there's a ton of scenes with characters staring at the camera for like five minutes and doing nothing. That is how the movie is. It sucks ass.

528
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:56,340
Sounds like an art film.

529
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,340
Yup.

530
00:42:58,340 --> 00:43:00,340
I was like, did you ever see Dancer in the Dark?

531
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:05,340
But she is naked and there's a scene where she's having sex with another guy and there is nippleage.

532
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,340
Okay, that's nice.

533
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
But that's about it.

534
00:43:07,340 --> 00:43:09,340
She takes her top off in, like, every movie.

535
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:11,340
Um, did you ever see Dancer in the Dark?

536
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:13,060
It's just a movie with Bjork in it.

537
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:15,980
Now don't get me wrong, I love Bjork and I love Dancer in the Dark actually, but it's

538
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:22,940
so pretentious because like the first four minutes of the movie is just music playing

539
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:27,700
like a symphony and all just paintings dissolving into one another.

540
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:29,940
Just paintings, pictures of paintings for four minutes.

541
00:43:29,940 --> 00:43:32,700
That's something to do with a movie you're in.

542
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:33,700
Exactly.

543
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:37,820
It has nothing to do, well it kind of, you could say it does because it's about her going

544
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:42,140
blind and so you know paintings get it because you know when you're blind you

545
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:50,660
can't see paintings but anyway so she sings crappy music instead no but

546
00:43:50,660 --> 00:43:53,360
there's this one thing where she's singing about everything in the factory

547
00:43:53,360 --> 00:44:06,700
and she's like I love your machine I love Bjork because she's crazy all right

548
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:19,900
anyway I love I love Margaret Cho's impression of Bjork I like a what was

549
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,980
that what was that a dinosaur what was that dinosaur in Jurassic Park remember

550
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:26,860
they killed a guy in the car not the raptor the laugh is sore the

551
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:31,980
laphosaurus that that remember the guy from sign for the postman on Seinfeld

552
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,980
was in Jurassic Park, right?

553
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Newman.

554
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:35,980
Newman.

555
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:36,980
Newman was in Jurassic Park.

556
00:44:36,980 --> 00:44:38,980
I didn't watch Seinfeld because that show was lame.

557
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,980
Okay, um, well, forget it then.

558
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,980
I'm talking to a wall.

559
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Well, no, go ahead.

560
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,980
I just don't know who you're talking about.

561
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:48,980
Okay, there's a scene in Jurassic Park.

562
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:52,980
He was the big fat guy with the glasses that was kind of the bad guy.

563
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:53,980
The lawyer?

564
00:44:53,980 --> 00:44:55,980
He wasn't the lawyer.

565
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:57,980
He was the computer programmer.

566
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:58,980
He took the security system down for him.

567
00:44:58,980 --> 00:44:59,980
I remember him.

568
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,820
Okay, was Nedry, was that his name in the movie?

569
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:03,820
Yes.

570
00:45:03,820 --> 00:45:04,820
Okay, his name was Nedry in the movie.

571
00:45:04,820 --> 00:45:05,820
I read the book.

572
00:45:05,820 --> 00:45:06,820
Okay.

573
00:45:06,820 --> 00:45:07,820
Okay, well it was the same thing in the book.

574
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:13,580
And he's running away, trying to escape, and the power goes out at that point or whatever,

575
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:21,060
and then the dinosaur comes up to him in the car, and it's going, and it's so cute, and

576
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:26,780
then he's like, hi guy, go away or something, and then the, I think he throws a rock at

577
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:32,220
the dinosaur or something and the dinosaur goes, and then spits on him and tears out

578
00:45:32,220 --> 00:45:34,460
his intestines or whatever dinosaurs do.

579
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:35,460
Ew, intestines.

580
00:45:35,460 --> 00:45:36,460
Yeah.

581
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,460
Oh my god.

582
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:40,700
I did have to laugh when the dinosaur got in his car.

583
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:44,100
Yeah, the dinosaur like hops in his car and eats him.

584
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:45,100
It's pretty cool.

585
00:45:45,100 --> 00:45:46,100
I think.

586
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:47,100
There's a dinosaur in the car.

587
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:50,420
I did like, though, Jurassic Park 3 was horrible, but it did have funny scenes in it.

588
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:51,860
I never saw Jurassic Park 3.

589
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:52,860
Ugh.

590
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:53,860
Like at the very end.

591
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:59,020
Jurassic Park 2 with the chick that does the gymnastics that was laughable but in

592
00:45:59,020 --> 00:46:03,340
in this in the third one there's a scene with the mama trying to store in her

593
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,860
baby and the guys like trapped in the thing mm-hmm and he's like the bad guy

594
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:14,580
so so she nudges the baby go ahead go ahead meet him go ahead if he goes okay

595
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:19,020
mommy that was funny is it true they're making a

596
00:46:19,020 --> 00:46:23,940
Jurassic Park 4. Yes. I heard, oh god. I have to see that and laugh at it. It's over. It's

597
00:46:23,940 --> 00:46:29,560
over people! No, it's on mainland now. Oh god. That was the worst part of Jurassic

598
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:33,800
Park 2 was when it was like San Diego gets invaded with velociraptors. Or they can find

599
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,340
maybe another island that they didn't know about that they're doing a third Jurassic

600
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:44,740
Park in. It's like, oh we didn't know about that one! Or bring Jeff Goldblum back to life

601
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:51,640
again yeah well just read just read the book the book was actually really really

602
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:57,340
good I think Jurassic Park should be like the dinosaurs attack you're a

603
00:46:57,340 --> 00:47:02,500
Disney or something like that Battle Royale versus Jurassic Park or how

604
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:07,220
about that new on Hong Kong Disney what better idea for a movie we'll have Tony

605
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:11,660
Jai versus the dinosaurs we'll just have him take him out can Vin Diesel be in it

606
00:47:11,660 --> 00:47:16,460
He can get eaten. He can be like the Steven Seagal character in

607
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:20,100
Executive Decision. Is Steven Seagal still making movies?

608
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:23,100
Unfortunately, yes. Dude, who is the Steven Seagal fan

609
00:47:23,100 --> 00:47:28,060
anymore? Um, the Midwest. I'm serious!

610
00:47:28,060 --> 00:47:31,780
Just the whole lot of them. The whole Midwest.

611
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:36,060
They're the people that still buy the Van Damme movies. And yes, he's still making movies.

612
00:47:36,060 --> 00:47:39,340
It's all B movies now. Guile's still making movies?

613
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:46,340
Yeah, he wasn't satisfied enough killing off fucking Raul Julia, but no, I gotta keep making more crappy movies.

614
00:47:46,340 --> 00:47:50,340
I feel so bad for Raul Julia for that being his last movie.

615
00:47:50,340 --> 00:47:57,340
I know. Technically, he had another thing on HBO that he won a lot of awards for, so he had that HBO thing.

616
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,340
That's sort of the redemption thing. Yeah, sort of the redemption thing.

617
00:47:59,340 --> 00:48:03,340
If only someone could go back in time and tell him not to make that movie. It's a bad idea.

618
00:48:03,340 --> 00:48:09,180
But remember that the Street Fighter movie came out when we were all like in what like seventh grade ish

619
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:11,180
At least I think I was in seventh grade, right? I

620
00:48:12,020 --> 00:48:15,980
Think it was like 1990 when that movie came out right 90 90 what it was like

621
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,820
You know you go and see it and you're like what the hell is this?

622
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:23,100
I actually remembered liking it when I saw it when I was younger and I saw it four times in the theater

623
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:28,680
I Wow, I remember dress my I drove. I had an obsession with Jean-Claude Van Damme when I was

624
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:33,780
That's funny, because I had an obsession with Kylie Minogue when I was younger, and she

625
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:34,780
was cammy.

626
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,960
That's the other reason I went and saw it, because I was like, oh my god, it's Kylie

627
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:38,960
Minogue!

628
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:40,680
I know, I was like, oh my god, it's Kylie Minogue, and she's cammy, that's going to

629
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:41,680
be sweet.

630
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:44,000
How did I not know I was gay when I was 11?

631
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:50,760
Anyway, so my dad took me to see this movie, and we watched it, and I remember thinking

632
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,040
when I was younger, boy, this is cheesy.

633
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:58,220
And then I went and saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II, The Secret of the Ewes, like the

634
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:04,400
next week or something. That movie had funny parts though. That movie was like, okay maybe

635
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:10,400
and then 3 was like no. And it had David Warner in it. Street Fighter came out in 94. 94?

636
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,400
Yeah, so that would have been a sophomore. I would have been a sophomore in high school?

637
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:19,200
Yeah, we both would have. I dragged my dad to see that even though I was a sophomore

638
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:25,440
in high school, I guess so. Wow. How did I get my license till junior? I was, yeah, well

639
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:28,680
I remember still being in high school when I saw it, so...

640
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,920
Yeah, I graduated that year.

641
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:34,320
Wow. God, I feel old anyway.

642
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:38,460
You were a sophomore, and I graduated that year. I know, I know. What?

643
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:39,620
You feel old?

644
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:44,760
That's true, I am younger. Yeah, so shut up.

645
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:46,360
Let's go to a break, shall we?

646
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:50,120
No. I think we need to do a break. No, I don't think so. Sorry, Rob, no break for you.

647
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:54,400
Yep, break time. When we come back from this break, we're going to be talking about

648
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:58,840
VDX 10 style, the consumer version that's going to be coming out soon because we actually

649
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:04,260
have been sent some MP3s from our buddy Siggy who calls in on the Skype line quite a bit.

650
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:07,600
He's going to call us back on Skype when we come back for the next break and talk about

651
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:11,840
these brand new 10 style consumer tracks. It's going to be pretty sweet, so stay tuned

652
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:14,760
for that. In the meantime, we're going to go to break and I thought in this break we

653
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:19,700
could do some music from Gita Dora V because as you might have heard at Tokyo Game Show

654
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:26,700
this week. Guitar Freaks V and Drummania V coming out for the Playstation 2. So, finally,

655
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:31,820
more stuff to import. Did you hear about the other thing about it? The arcade style controller,

656
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:36,300
the ASC is also going to be released for Guitar Freaks. Okay, I have to tell Dan about that.

657
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:39,540
I don't know about Drummania. I'll buy those. I'll buy those guitars. But they're doing

658
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:43,860
an ASC for Guitar Freaks. If they did a Drummania one, you know I'd freaking have that. I don't

659
00:50:43,860 --> 00:50:48,140
even know how the hell they would do an arcade style version of that. I mean, it's easy enough.

660
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:52,620
It's gonna be sweet either way, and I'm just excited because I'm hoping that they can bring

661
00:50:52,620 --> 00:50:53,660
back now.

662
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:57,700
They can make these games, because, assumably, they'll do one for V2 down the line if this

663
00:50:57,700 --> 00:51:02,220
is successful, and they can add so many old songs in it.

664
00:51:02,220 --> 00:51:03,220
I hope.

665
00:51:03,220 --> 00:51:04,220
I really hope they do it.

666
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:06,620
Well, you know, they are talking about doing this for the U.S. too.

667
00:51:06,620 --> 00:51:07,620
Really?

668
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:08,620
I don't know.

669
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:09,620
We'll see.

670
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:10,620
We'll see.

671
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,180
Maybe that'll be the big secret at next year's E3.

672
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,180
We'll see.

673
00:51:13,180 --> 00:51:14,180
We'll see.

674
00:51:14,180 --> 00:51:15,180
All right.

675
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,820
off with some B4U next. B4U next is gonna kick it off. And then we're also gonna have

676
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:24,440
a band called Pooh in this break, all from Gita Dora V. We'll be back after this with

677
00:51:24,440 --> 00:51:31,440
with more Orange Launch Radio!

678
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:40,180
spirit, arts and business

679
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:43,180
We have come to see you

680
00:53:43,180 --> 00:53:47,180
We are driven and really driven

681
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:52,180
Don't you like the second girl?

682
00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:59,180
The best self-evident woman now

683
00:53:59,180 --> 00:54:01,180
With a big star

684
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:05,180
Please don't you

685
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:14,180
Shout out to you, we still love you

686
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:16,180
There we go, we still love you

687
00:54:16,180 --> 00:54:20,180
Eggplants from down, rain down the table

688
00:54:20,180 --> 00:54:23,180
Eggplants from down, rain down the table

689
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:27,180
We must have found someone to be

690
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:17,320
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh

691
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:25,320
All it takes to be so far from this fallen sea

692
00:55:25,320 --> 00:55:33,320
But you've all about a way to shadow up my fate

693
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:38,320
Your kisses turn from hot to cold and I've felt like a center bone

694
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:43,320
Cheeseburger with dirty men looking for love that they'll never get

695
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:49,320
Feelin' about you, feelin' alone I'm doin' so hard, I'm on the run

696
00:55:49,320 --> 00:55:56,320
Feelin' no way, feelin' no way If you wanna lie to me again

697
00:55:56,320 --> 00:56:02,320
Then really run to space and call again Just go there and save it

698
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:36,040
You bigger ones are makin' all the ends of the road then

699
00:56:36,320 --> 00:56:56,460
Bet South and save that

700
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:59,460
The long engines roll

701
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:53,540
Welcome back, boys and girls, to Orange Lounge Radio.

702
00:58:53,540 --> 00:58:57,780
Here we are in the midst of episode number 156.

703
00:58:57,780 --> 00:59:01,300
We are going to get to those 10th style consumer tracks very soon here.

704
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:06,000
However, we wanted to get to a couple other little things here real quick first, including

705
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:09,540
a brand new segment here on Orange Lounge Radio.

706
00:59:09,540 --> 00:59:12,540
We're going to have a brand new segment.

707
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:15,400
It's something we're trying out, brand new tonight.

708
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,140
So we hope you guys enjoy it.

709
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:22,020
And tonight's segment is going to be, and if it's well received by you guys, we'll do

710
00:59:22,020 --> 00:59:25,620
something like this like every week or every other week. I have to just consider it a variation

711
00:59:25,620 --> 00:59:31,420
once we announce what it is. We should have our listeners participate. By failing us one

712
00:59:31,420 --> 00:59:36,380
and the best one we win. We could read. That would be a good idea or we could do something

713
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:42,520
on the forums or something. Tonight's new segment is going to be Dark Sakura's Yo Mama

714
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:50,920
Yomama Joke of the Week.

715
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:51,920
That's right.

716
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:52,920
This is going to be...huh?

717
00:59:52,920 --> 00:59:55,320
The music's messed up.

718
00:59:55,320 --> 01:00:00,040
It's a leftover from Vanilla Sky, so now that that show's not on anymore, we have this here,

719
01:00:00,040 --> 01:00:01,840
so anyway.

720
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:06,080
So this segment is very simple because Yomama Jokes are still funny.

721
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:09,520
Dark Sakura will be reading a Yomama Joke every week.

722
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:13,520
So, DarkSakuro, what is tonight's Yo Mama joke of the week?

723
01:00:13,520 --> 01:00:15,520
Are you sure you can handle it?

724
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:17,520
I think so.

725
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:21,520
Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.

726
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,520
Great, that's great.

727
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:27,520
Oh, that was so funny.

728
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:29,520
Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.

729
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:31,520
What's that sound I hear? Oh yes!

730
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,520
It's jumping the shark.

731
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,520
I got another one.

732
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:39,520
No, no, save it for next week. You only get one joke a week.

733
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,520
I have a lot of Yo Mama jokes.

734
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:41,520
I know you do.

735
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:43,520
Alright.

736
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:56,520
Yeah, see, some of the old school, some of the old school, um, Orange Lawn's radio listeners actually remember that being the exact same theme music we used to use on Vanilla Sky for the world's worst forward.

737
01:00:56,520 --> 01:01:01,400
forward, where I would read a forwarded joke over email, like things that actually get

738
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:06,120
sent to me at work. But the ironic thing is, I mean, we haven't been doing Vanilla Sky

739
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:11,960
lately on the network just because of personal conflicts with scheduling. And I don't get

740
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:16,040
forwarded emails at work anymore. Like, they crack down on it or something, so I really

741
01:01:16,040 --> 01:01:19,680
don't get them anymore. So I wouldn't have any jokes to read anyway. So I'm glad we could

742
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,680
recycle the theme movie.

743
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:26,040
So, listeners, if you have a really awesome Yo Mama joke, send them to jamie at orange

744
01:01:26,040 --> 01:01:32,600
zoundsradio.com and while I'm sifting through emails from teachers and the

745
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:38,520
podcast email list and everything else. She'll have some Yo Momma Jokes. I'll have some Yo Momma Jokes too to

746
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:41,320
make it work. And you know what, maybe once a month we could mix it up a little

747
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,880
bit and do Yo Daddy. Do Yo Daddy. We're an equal opportunity show. Yeah, we're equal

748
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:52,520
opportunity offenders so we could do Yo Daddy. All right. Now we got the whole

749
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:55,640
chat room started. It's gonna be one of those jokes where all night long they

750
01:01:55,640 --> 01:02:05,080
can't stop talking about it speaking of tonight's podcast it should be pretty

751
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,320
interesting because we're gonna be talking about a lot of things that have

752
01:02:07,320 --> 01:02:11,480
been going on at Tokyo game show and you know I can't resist asking about this

753
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:15,760
one I'm sure a lot of you guys on the internet have seen this by now if you

754
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,680
haven't run on over to orange laundry calm and take a look at this it's the

755
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:25,520
brand new Nintendo revolution controller huh what do you think the nunchucks the

756
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:34,480
Nintendo nunchucks what do you think the controller I don't know it's kind of one

757
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,660
of those things where I can't knock it till I've tried it I mean bless Nintendo

758
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:40,880
for doing something new certainly they're trying something new with this

759
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,160
but I don't know it's just it's gonna be kind of weird at first but then again if

760
01:02:46,160 --> 01:02:49,720
you think about it you know a lot of them you know the eye toy was weird at

761
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,560
first too but of course the eye toy is not that great a peripheral now just

762
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:56,360
because they don't have good games to support it.

763
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,620
Well, I guess maybe DDR, but even then,

764
01:02:58,620 --> 01:03:01,160
hands and feet modes kind of knocked on the beginning.

765
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:04,040
They have some other games that feature the itoy.

766
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,240
What, Antigrav?

767
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:05,760
No.

768
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,220
They have this game, DT Racer, which

769
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,120
was a really crappy racing game that used the itoy

770
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:12,520
for some reason to steer.

771
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,960
And they have another game, Virtua Tennis,

772
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,880
that you can use that to play tennis as well.

773
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:21,680
All the games that feature the itoy, though,

774
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:25,680
other than like, you know, DDR and stuff, they kind of suck.

775
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:28,680
Well, even those iToy modes suck.

776
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,680
I know, I know.

777
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:33,680
You know, the thing, though, about the Nintendo Revolution,

778
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,680
the controller is not my issue.

779
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:37,680
I'm willing to try this new controller. I think it'll be interesting.

780
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:40,680
It's different, so it gives the Nintendo something

781
01:03:40,680 --> 01:03:42,680
to really separate itself from Sony and Microsoft,

782
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:44,680
which is kind of what it needs right now.

783
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:45,680
You know what my first complaint about it is?

784
01:03:45,680 --> 01:03:46,680
What's that?

785
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:47,680
Ergonomics.

786
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,680
You think?

787
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:51,680
That controller is not ergonomically sound.

788
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:53,180
Well, well.

789
01:03:53,180 --> 01:04:01,180
Seriously, hold out your hand for a moment and think about how it's going to be working a remote control for hours of gameplay.

790
01:04:01,180 --> 01:04:09,180
That's why, for example, I always bring this up as an example of the best controller ever designed.

791
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:13,180
And that would be the Saturn dual analog controller.

792
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:16,180
That, it fits naturally to your hand.

793
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:20,040
even the PlayStation controller, it's meant to fit to your hand.

794
01:04:20,040 --> 01:04:26,040
You know, why is it that Nintendo has always had these bizarre-ass controllers that hurt to play?

795
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,980
Well, I think the Super Nintendo had an intelligent controller.

796
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:31,380
And if you'll notice,

797
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:34,240
they re-released that style controller

798
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:37,660
for the NES when they brought out the top loader.

799
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:39,180
They did one, um...

800
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:45,020
Naki did one for the GameCube. I have, like, two of them.

801
01:04:45,020 --> 01:04:55,020
I think that a lot of the complaint they're going to get with this controller, apart from it just being a really bad idea in general, is a case of ergonomics.

802
01:04:55,020 --> 01:04:59,020
That controller is not going to be a comfortable thing to play for a long time.

803
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:01,020
We'll see, we'll see.

804
01:05:01,020 --> 01:05:06,020
Did you see the mockup that Loki posted on our website earlier just a couple days ago?

805
01:05:06,020 --> 01:05:08,020
I saw what was on Nintendo's website.

806
01:05:08,020 --> 01:05:12,860
the wave bird thing where you can plug that little remote into like a wave bird controller

807
01:05:12,860 --> 01:05:18,740
style controller and you can play your revolution games like with a game cube style controller.

808
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:22,820
My other thought was that, you know, a month later they were going to bring out some overpriced

809
01:05:22,820 --> 01:05:25,700
controller that's all ergonomically sound that they're going to charge a bajillion for

810
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:31,900
because it's Nintendo. They do shit like this. Are your arms hurting? Get the new Nintendo

811
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:37,820
arm hurt eliminator or whatever they call it. Well seriously, I knew right now I'm not

812
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:42,980
going to be able to play that machine, given the risk problems I have at work.

813
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,660
I have to use a trackball mouse.

814
01:05:45,660 --> 01:05:52,380
I can't hold two separate things like that and hold my hand in that position without

815
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:54,620
having quite a bit of pain.

816
01:05:54,620 --> 01:05:55,980
So are you going to give it a try?

817
01:05:55,980 --> 01:06:01,360
See if maybe the feel of it is different than it looks at first?

818
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:06,620
Of course I'm going to try it, but in the end, looking at the design, having a very

819
01:06:06,620 --> 01:06:12,220
good sense of spatial awareness and knowing how my hands work, you know, and just with

820
01:06:12,220 --> 01:06:17,020
the bajillions of other people I work with, you know, good friends of mine at my job who

821
01:06:17,020 --> 01:06:23,580
all have carpal tunnel, various other ailments that come from doing a desk job, you know,

822
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:27,820
even for people who just play on the internet a lot, you know, or developing the same wrist

823
01:06:27,820 --> 01:06:32,620
ailments because the average home is not set up to be ergonomically correct for your own

824
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:33,620
desk.

825
01:06:33,620 --> 01:06:34,620
Right.

826
01:06:34,620 --> 01:06:39,420
having this in your hand for standard gameplay, and a lot of gamers, when they get into their

827
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:43,020
game, they'll ignore their own pain for the game. I'm sorry, it happens. I've done it.

828
01:06:43,020 --> 01:06:44,660
Some people don't, yeah.

829
01:06:44,660 --> 01:06:51,620
And that's going to cause, it's just going to open up a load of medical concerns.

830
01:06:51,620 --> 01:06:52,620
Well, we'll see.

831
01:06:52,620 --> 01:06:54,380
I really do think it's going to be a question of economics.

832
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:58,720
Now, let's not forget, though, that some, now, things could change. This is still very,

833
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:04,080
very early on, and I seem to recall that when we saw the Nintendo DS at E3, only a few months

834
01:07:04,080 --> 01:07:10,660
before it's released, the DS kind of changed. Like, I remember the one at E3 was more rounded

835
01:07:10,660 --> 01:07:15,560
on the sides. They kind of changed the way the DS is shaped, and so they changed kind

836
01:07:15,560 --> 01:07:19,020
of the way the controller and buttons were, so things could change with this before it's

837
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,020
actually released.

838
01:07:20,020 --> 01:07:24,160
I did notice a different setting of the buttons, and this is actually a little bit more comfortable

839
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:26,520
to play than the mock-up they had at E3.

840
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:30,940
So, we'll see. So maybe when they do some of the extensive testing, some of your concerns

841
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,540
are going to come out and they'll, they'll kind of rethink some things, so.

842
01:07:34,540 --> 01:07:37,340
Yeah. We'll see what happens. We'll see what happens.

843
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,380
All right, um. And by the way, according to Firebomb, uh,

844
01:07:40,380 --> 01:07:43,900
Loki, you're the reason babies cry at night.

845
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:47,100
Are they still? Yeah, they, they don't stop bitching. I just ignore it.

846
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,860
All right. You know, I got over it, like, years ago.

847
01:07:50,860 --> 01:07:56,220
All right, that's fine. That's fine. All right, we're gonna get again, get into,

848
01:07:56,220 --> 01:08:03,860
hi how are you well hi guys anyway let's um how long you guys have been knocking

853
01:08:22,660 --> 01:08:28,700
weekend at their real-life gathering. I know most of you hear me talk about that quite

854
01:08:28,700 --> 01:08:34,220
a bit, but yeah. So it's just meeting real people behind the covers.

855
01:08:34,220 --> 01:08:36,020
Welcome back to the show, Angel. I know it's been a while since you've been here.

856
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:37,020
Yeah, I know.

857
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:40,340
All right, and the 23rd Magus, you haven't been here in a long-ass time.

858
01:08:40,340 --> 01:08:44,420
I know. It's been painful. I swear it's been painful.

859
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:51,240
Well, you're here. I want to slap your shirt because it's a giant power button. Not that

860
01:08:51,240 --> 01:08:56,860
I want to turn you on. Not that I want to turn you on, but anyway. Let's move on. Let's

861
01:08:56,860 --> 01:09:00,280
move on. Thanks for the pleasant surprise, you guys. Um, let's move on. For the record,

862
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:08,800
you're looking older. Aww, our Andrew's getting so big. La la la. Aww. Anyway. I'm just kidding.

863
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:12,080
I've got somebody on Skype that's waiting for us to cut the bullshit and get to his

864
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:18,320
call, so hello, Siggy. How are you doing? Hey, Sky, I'm doing fine. Good, good to hear.

865
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:25,320
Now, what's this? You found some new stuff in regards to 2DX 10th Style, the consumer version?

866
01:09:25,320 --> 01:09:26,320
Yup.

867
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
What do you got for us tonight?

868
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:33,320
Oh, there are two 2DX 10th Style CS exclusives, but they are long versions.

869
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:38,320
Ooh, very cool. So we have some long versions. Now, how did you come across these MP3s?

870
01:09:38,320 --> 01:09:45,320
Panda of L.O.T.B. from Bimani Style forums has posted it on the temporary forums.

871
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:53,320
That's right, Bamani Style right now is running on some temporary forums and I thought it was kind of interesting because isn't like some gaming company hosting their sites like Playasia or something?

872
01:09:53,320 --> 01:09:56,320
Yeah, it was Playasia that was hosting the temporary forums.

873
01:09:56,320 --> 01:10:00,320
Interesting. Are they still running on a temporary basis or did they get back up or what?

874
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:01,320
I haven't visited them in a while.

875
01:10:01,320 --> 01:10:03,320
They're still running right now.

876
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:09,320
Oh cool, okay. Very cool. Alright. So anyway, about these songs.

877
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:15,680
Um, before I, uh, introduce The Silent Side, I wanna post this, uh, website on the chatroom right now.

878
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,880
Go for it. And that chatroom, once again, orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

879
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:24,720
Click on chat if you wanna join in the chatroom and get these little links as people post them, as Siggy's doing right now.

880
01:10:24,720 --> 01:10:28,440
Here it is. It's on the Xenon website.

881
01:10:28,440 --> 01:10:37,200
And, uh, what this site has is, uh, you know, pictures of, uh, 2DX 10-style CES, uh, shot from a Tokyo game show.

882
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,200
Very cool, of course, because this game is being shown at Tokyo Game Pro right now.

883
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:41,200
Right next to Iroha.

884
01:10:41,200 --> 01:10:44,200
Okay, very cool.

885
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:50,200
So, I will introduce, you know, the confirmed songs, like CS exclusives and the old music.

886
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:55,200
But first I'm going to introduce the old music that has been confirmed for Ten Style CES.

887
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,200
And there are only four of them so far.

888
01:10:57,200 --> 01:11:02,200
Traces, Quasar, Love Shine, and the also-loving V.

889
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:08,200
Now, somebody mentioned the V thing in the chat room before the show started, and I was just like,

890
01:11:08,200 --> 01:11:17,200
oh my gosh, okay, if V is returning in 10th style, that means it was in 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and now 10th.

891
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:19,200
Can we say overkill?

892
01:11:19,200 --> 01:11:21,200
Yeah, it's really the longest one.

893
01:11:21,200 --> 01:11:22,200
Wow, okay.

894
01:11:22,200 --> 01:11:27,200
And now I'm going to introduce the CS exclusives that have been confirmed so far.

895
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:30,160
so far there are four of them and two of them are gonna you know gonna be under

896
01:11:30,160 --> 01:11:34,240
like a minute long clip so I'm gonna introduce the first one that's uh the

897
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:42,120
genre is gaba and the song is hype the core by DJ Chucky oh okay and then the

898
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:49,160
second song is a genre is a psychedelic trance and it's by LED it's ixian mm-hmm

899
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:53,920
and now for the songs that you know that has the clip a minute long and the

900
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,920
The genre is R&B, and here's Asami with Strong Woman featuring Double.

901
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,920
Alright, here it is.

902
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:55,360
All right, that sounds pretty cool. I like that. It's kind of got a cool little beat

903
01:12:55,360 --> 01:13:00,360
to it. I think that'll be a fun one to play in the game. That's kind of cool. I like that.

904
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:06,360
And here's a little fact about Strong Woman. The artist Asami is under 573 Records.

905
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:11,480
Oh, very cool. Konami's little record label. Cool. Hey, do you know if this is true or

906
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:15,560
not? I heard a rumor that Akira Yamaoka's album got pushed back to January. Is that

907
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,800
true? You know anything about that?

908
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:19,800
I didn't get any details for that.

909
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:22,760
I heard something about it. I don't know if this is true or not, but I heard that Akira

910
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:27,400
I'm out cuz albums getting pushed back from October to January which is kind of a bummer because it's supposed to come out Halloween week

911
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:30,160
Which is so appropriate, but we'll see. We'll see anyway. Yeah, and

912
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:32,760
Here's the last song

913
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:37,480
You know one of the CS exclusives and this one's a very deep Japanese meaning

914
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:41,360
I still I can't figure out what what it means. Hmm. So here's the

915
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:49,040
Here's the genre is Japanese pops. Here's a bermé Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka with Taito no Suika

916
01:13:49,040 --> 01:13:51,040
All right, here it is.

917
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:48,440
That's kind of a

918
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,440
different one. I don't know if I could see that in 2DX, but...

919
01:14:51,440 --> 01:14:53,440
Reminds me of the soundtrack that goes in the shell.

920
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,440
Okay. It reminds me too much of Yoko Kanno.

921
01:14:57,440 --> 01:15:00,440
It's a good song. I like that song. It's just kind of...

922
01:15:00,440 --> 01:15:03,440
That's going to be an interesting one for 2DX. Maybe that's going to be an easy difficulty.

923
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,440
I don't know. We'll see.

924
01:15:05,440 --> 01:15:09,440
Yeah, hopefully it would be difficult on another.

925
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,440
Yeah, I could see that, maybe.

926
01:15:11,440 --> 01:15:14,440
Now, what's your personal opinion on those two songs?

927
01:15:14,440 --> 01:15:19,440
Well, I kind of like Strong Woman featuring Dabo better than Taito no Suica.

928
01:15:19,440 --> 01:15:24,440
But they're both good songs. I really like, a lot of the consumer songs lately have been very strong.

929
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:30,440
Of course, like, you know, 8th Style had some good ones there with the, god, Everyday Lovely Day and all that stuff.

930
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:35,440
And, you know, there's been a lot of good ones lately. So I'm happy to see that they're still putting out the 2DX.

931
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:40,440
And it looks like, you know, Red and Happy Style happen eventually too, which is good. Very good.

932
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:55,440
Yeah. On the website right now, the Xenon website, there are links that have the video files that contain videos from 10 style CS that has been recorded, like Ixion and Hypedacore, and also Strong Woman.

933
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,440
However, when I watch these videos, you won't be able to hear the actual song.

934
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:03,440
Oh, you can just see the video.

935
01:16:03,440 --> 01:16:10,440
Yeah, you're only going to see the video, but you're only going to hear outside what's happening on the TGS.

936
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:18,440
Right. Speaking of what's happening on the TGS floor, what else have you heard about what's going on at Tokyo Game Show? Anything else that's exciting to you?

937
01:16:18,440 --> 01:16:27,440
Nothing much else. I only checked out Popin' Music Era and GITADORA V. I was surprised that they're going to have GITADORA V for the PS2.

938
01:16:27,440 --> 01:16:35,440
That was kind of a real surprise announcement I think to a lot of us. We kind of all kind of assumed that Guitar Freaks and Drummania on PS2 was dead and gone.

939
01:16:35,440 --> 01:16:42,440
But it always was kind of interesting that they kept it going in the arcades and yet no love for it on the console.

940
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:46,440
So it was just kind of like, maybe it was something that we always kind of wished would happen in the back of our minds.

941
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:51,440
It was just kind of sudden, like, oh my gosh. I mean we were expecting, you know, obviously we were expecting 2DX10.

942
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:58,440
We were expecting Strike, we were expecting Youdoha, but to see Guitar Freaks as well is pretty cool.

943
01:16:58,440 --> 01:17:06,440
I think the only thing that could top that in the surprise category is, like Loki said, they end up bringing that to America,

944
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:11,440
which would be very interesting when you consider the Guitar Heroes on its way as well. It could be very interesting.

945
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,440
So we'll see.

946
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,440
Alright, well, Siggy, thank you very much for calling in and sharing those songs with us.

947
01:17:18,440 --> 01:17:22,440
We appreciate it. Helping us stay in the know on what's going on in the Bahmani world.

948
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:23,440
No problem.

949
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:25,440
Any other final thoughts for us?

950
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:28,440
Not at the moment. I just can't think of any.

951
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:36,440
But everybody on the Bahmani-style forums have been complaining about V being back in the game again.

952
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:53,440
Yeah. It's one of those things now where they must just be doing it out of tradition or something, I don't know, because the song's so horrid. I don't know if it's some type of nod to the fans or something, but I guess it's okay as long as it's just one song.

953
01:17:53,440 --> 01:18:00,440
I mean, if they were bringing back, like, five or six songs every time, I'd be like, okay, people. But if it's just one song, that's okay.

954
01:18:00,440 --> 01:18:06,440
Oh, one more thing. On the 10th style results screens, they're going to feature more Goliarts.

955
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:10,440
I heard about that, because in the arcades, they didn't have anything unless you triple A'd a song.

956
01:18:10,440 --> 01:18:16,440
They lacked Goliarts. They lacked the Goliarts. It's already featured on the Xenon website right now.

957
01:18:16,440 --> 01:18:22,440
It's featured in Nix, and used for the single A, and then Nix for the double A.

958
01:18:22,440 --> 01:18:24,440
Very cool, very cool.

959
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:27,440
Oh, you're talking about the repetition of V, right?

960
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:36,440
Well, look at DDR, for example, say B4U, it's been in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, actually 6 mixes if you count 4th Plus.

961
01:18:36,440 --> 01:18:43,440
Okay, okay, maybe, but not 6 back-to-back mixes. But I get what you're saying, B4U is kind of a DDR anthem.

962
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:44,440
It's a staple.

963
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:48,440
I mean, hell, they named a band after it, so, you know, okay, I get it, I get it, maybe.

964
01:18:48,440 --> 01:18:52,440
But B4U is also a 2DX song, so why not repeat that over and over again?

965
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:54,440
Because it's a staple of DDR, not 2DX.

966
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,440
Alright, alright.

967
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,440
It's just a cameo.

968
01:18:58,440 --> 01:18:59,320
All right.

969
01:18:59,320 --> 01:19:01,240
All right, Siggy, thanks so much for your call.

970
01:19:01,240 --> 01:19:02,680
And calling us tonight, all right?

971
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:03,160
Have a good one.

972
01:19:03,160 --> 01:19:03,600
Yeah.

973
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:03,840
All right.

974
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:04,280
Bye.

975
01:19:04,280 --> 01:19:04,480
Later.

976
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:05,680
Later.

977
01:19:05,680 --> 01:19:09,120
All right, that's the one on Siggy.

978
01:19:09,120 --> 01:19:14,020
Sharing some 2DX MP3s with us, so we appreciate that.

979
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,480
Those of you guys out there in chat

980
01:19:15,480 --> 01:19:17,600
that want to call us on the Skype line as well,

981
01:19:17,600 --> 01:19:19,400
you're going to get your chance very soon here

982
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:20,060
after this break.

983
01:19:20,060 --> 01:19:22,480
We're also going to get into tonight's Orange Lounge Radio

984
01:19:22,480 --> 01:19:23,120
Cage match.

985
01:19:23,120 --> 01:19:25,240
Should be very interesting.

986
01:19:25,240 --> 01:19:29,000
I want to point out that tonight's pre-show music was all music. Some of you guys have

987
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:36,000
probably heard this before, but this was disc two of the Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune soundtrack.

988
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,280
That's actually the second game.

989
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,080
Tune two. The soundtrack is the first and second.

990
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:44,060
So each disc is each game.

991
01:19:44,060 --> 01:19:46,300
Oh, very cool. Very cool.

992
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,160
All right.

993
01:19:47,160 --> 01:19:51,520
And it had Polteri! It did. You allowed Polteri to be played on the station, but I kind of...

994
01:19:51,520 --> 01:19:54,800
Just because the whole soundtrack is fabulous. Yeah, it's a good soundtrack, and I actually like

995
01:19:54,800 --> 01:19:57,360
Like the Polteri songs on there, so.

996
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,960
Also before we go to break, I want to talk to Angel and Magus a little more.

997
01:19:59,960 --> 01:20:02,200
So you guys went, yeah, damn.

998
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:03,680
You come to the show and you have to talk.

999
01:20:03,680 --> 01:20:05,680
Yeah, it was almost all over.

1000
01:20:05,680 --> 01:20:06,680
Oh, okay.

1001
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:09,960
Now you guys went to this convention for There, the game?

1002
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:10,960
Yeah.

1003
01:20:10,960 --> 01:20:11,960
Where was the convention?

1004
01:20:11,960 --> 01:20:12,960
San Mateo.

1005
01:20:12,960 --> 01:20:13,960
San Mateo.

1006
01:20:13,960 --> 01:20:14,960
And how was it?

1007
01:20:14,960 --> 01:20:16,680
Now for those that don't know what There is, tell us a little bit about it.

1008
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,360
Kind of like if you've heard of Second Life or, it's MMO, you know.

1009
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:26,360
They don't, they, uh, multi-, massively multi-, yeah, you know, MMO without RPGs.

1010
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:27,360
MMO.

1011
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:31,360
It's, it's more of a virtual world than it is an MMO. It's massively multiplayer, but it's not an RPG.

1012
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,360
Right.

1013
01:20:32,360 --> 01:20:35,360
It's like a graphical chat, or is there a game to it, or?

1014
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:50,360
Basically, it's like that, but you have, uh, it's just based around a series of islands and such, and you have, like, buggies and hoverboards and hoverboats, and you can own property and, uh, play several mini-games in there.

1015
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,720
it's not easy and it's it's a social and then i'll

1016
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:57,620
you know what it is

1017
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:00,140
that's interesting it's order i wonder why i don't hear more about it well how

1018
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:01,340
many people are at this convention

1019
01:21:01,340 --> 01:21:02,100
uh...

1020
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,660
about fifty five or so

1021
01:21:03,660 --> 01:21:05,980
okay cool and what kind of what kind of stuff to begin

1022
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:09,140
uh... had a lot of them

1023
01:21:09,140 --> 01:21:10,380
rule

1024
01:21:10,380 --> 01:21:13,020
like kind like meetings but not

1025
01:21:13,020 --> 01:21:16,500
like you know uh... each of the staff would give a presentation

1026
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,020
on certain things

1027
01:21:18,020 --> 01:21:20,880
were involving the community of the game and

1028
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:25,640
uh... whether it be economics or community involvement or just

1029
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:28,460
you know it's just uh... open chat

1030
01:21:28,460 --> 01:21:31,700
they would we would split up whoever wanted to go to whatever

1031
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:33,300
uh...

1032
01:21:33,300 --> 01:21:38,180
speech or whatever and uh... i don't know it was it was it was good

1033
01:21:38,180 --> 01:21:39,640

1034
01:21:39,640 --> 01:21:42,080

1035
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:43,420
you

1036
01:21:43,420 --> 01:21:44,900
have interacted with

1037
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,160
in the game

1038
01:21:46,160 --> 01:21:49,940
you know and gotten to be friends with finishes

1039
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:53,240

1041
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:56,760

1042
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,120
very good times i'm very tired though

1043
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:02,200
uh... thank you found a little bit higher but that's alright i'm i'm

1044
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,120
usually tired at this convention usually

1045
01:22:04,120 --> 01:22:09,000
when you hear the uh... show that on or talk radio that's right after e three

1046
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:12,240
you know we all have what you want to die it was kind of funny we also like

1047
01:22:12,240 --> 01:22:19,400
we want to die life blows you know don't yeah yeah yeah hotels he it was a nice

1048
01:22:19,400 --> 01:22:25,120
hotel but it's like I want to go home now bye hmm all right a quick follow-up

1049
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:28,640
to the phone call we just had on these repetitions I mean the chat room want to

1050
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:33,900
share this I mean instead saying the another for V has quite possibly the

1051
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:40,280
hardest chart of any song up until 2d x red red has scorpion fire so I'll bet

1052
01:22:40,280 --> 01:22:47,240
money that V is not in red consumer style so maybe that's one reason why V

1053
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:51,880
keeps repeating because the difficulty okay I can see that maybe safe bet

1054
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:55,760
although I would think most people they're going after the difficulty have

1055
01:22:55,760 --> 01:23:00,720
like five different versions of 2dx but yeah that's just me all right let's go

1056
01:23:00,720 --> 01:23:03,440
to break you guys when we come back we're gonna be doing the cage match and

1057
01:23:03,440 --> 01:23:06,120
more orange lounge radio we're gonna start it off with a little bit of a

1058
01:23:06,120 --> 01:23:10,080
nebula grass person LED here you know they read just now okay what Loki

1059
01:23:10,080 --> 01:23:15,320
tomorrow is international talk like a pirate day I heard about talk talk like

1060
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:20,520
a pirate day is stupid you know the natural enemy of the ninja is the pirate

1061
01:23:20,520 --> 01:23:25,280

1062
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:31,000
anything at all no you just speak in Japanese very hush Japanese like in the

I hear you

1079
01:30:50,380 --> 01:31:07,300
Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us, Orange Lounge

1080
01:31:07,300 --> 01:31:08,300
Radio.

1081
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:16,340
Hello everybody, and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1082
01:31:16,340 --> 01:31:18,340
I hope you enjoyed some of the songs there on that break.

1083
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,340
Nebula Grasper from the 2DX.

1084
01:31:20,340 --> 01:31:23,340
Ghosts from 2DDR.

1085
01:31:23,340 --> 01:31:29,340
AA or Double Ace, however you choose to pronounce that one, from 2DX Red as well.

1086
01:31:29,340 --> 01:31:33,340
And then I Feel. That was actually the DDR version, but of course I Feel was in both games.

1087
01:31:33,340 --> 01:31:36,340
Anyway, back to the show.

1088
01:31:36,340 --> 01:31:39,340
I feel better because I have vanilla milkshake.

1089
01:31:39,340 --> 01:31:41,340
Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?

1090
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:45,340
Thank you for resurrecting that joke that died years ago.

1091
01:31:45,340 --> 01:31:49,340
You know, that was just last year, wasn't it? That that song was big?

1092
01:31:49,340 --> 01:31:52,340
That was just last year. Wasn't that bad?

1093
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,340
Alright.

1094
01:31:54,340 --> 01:31:56,340
DarkSakura, how you doing over there?

1095
01:31:56,340 --> 01:31:58,340
About to blast somebody.

1096
01:31:58,340 --> 01:31:59,340
Yeah, what's going on?

1097
01:31:59,340 --> 01:32:07,340
Apparently somebody on dig.com said that our podcast sucks because for some reason they added a ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle.

1098
01:32:07,340 --> 01:32:09,340
What the fuck?

1099
01:32:09,340 --> 01:32:11,340
That ditzy girl they're referring to is actually Rob.

1100
01:32:11,340 --> 01:32:14,340
Yeah, I'm the ditzy girl apparently.

1101
01:32:14,340 --> 01:32:21,220
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, first of all, first of all, I probably have more intelligence

1102
01:32:21,220 --> 01:32:27,220
in my little toe than this person does if they clone them on repeat ad infinitum, okay?

1103
01:32:27,220 --> 01:32:32,620
Secondly, is, you know, it's a stupid message board.

1104
01:32:32,620 --> 01:32:35,220
I get, are you going to dignify it with a response?

1105
01:32:35,220 --> 01:32:37,720
Although you kind of already did, but that's alright.

1106
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,540
I haven't said anything yet.

1107
01:32:39,540 --> 01:32:43,860
Well, here's the thing, though, and you know, anybody that's coming over from the podcast,

1108
01:32:43,860 --> 01:32:46,940
because we had a little increase of listeners to this live show because of our podcast,

1109
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:47,940
which is pretty cool.

1110
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:51,820
I'm just going to say this, I've repeated his comment to quote and say which one I'm

1111
01:32:51,820 --> 01:32:56,060
referring to, and I'm just going to say this, next time listen to the podcast all the way

1112
01:32:56,060 --> 01:33:01,140
through before deciding. I'm sorry, but you're a loser. No, I'm not going to call him a loser

1113
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:06,140
because I know my netiquette, but I am going to say that you were the giggling girl.

1114
01:33:06,140 --> 01:33:16,740
All right, that's fine. If you know the history of Orange Lawns Radio, this radio station

1115
01:33:16,740 --> 01:33:21,820
actually started with Dark Sakura and myself. Loki actually was not a part of the original

1116
01:33:21,820 --> 01:33:26,580
vision of the station, because we didn't really know Loki when the show first started. We

1117
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:30,340
met him, we knew who he was, he was this guy.

1118
01:33:30,340 --> 01:33:31,340
You knew me!

1119
01:33:31,340 --> 01:33:35,060
We knew you, but we didn't know that much about you. Like, you came to the Bamani parties,

1120
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:40,060
and we knew that you did things with memory cards and you did a lot of edits and stuff.

1121
01:33:40,060 --> 01:33:44,900
We knew that, but we didn't really know you, but you showed up to every single episode

1122
01:33:44,900 --> 01:33:48,020
of the first 20 shows and you were just a natural fit for the show, so we were like,

1123
01:33:48,020 --> 01:33:52,900
fuck it, we're gonna call Loki a co-host. So it's been Dark Sakura, myself, and Loki

1124
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:59,660
since late 2001, so we didn't just add Dark Sakura to the podcast just so we could have

1125
01:33:59,660 --> 01:34:03,940
some tits on the podcast. I mean, seriously, okay? It's not, you know, we've...

1126
01:34:03,940 --> 01:34:05,940
But more tips on the podcast would be cool.

1127
01:34:05,940 --> 01:34:09,940
If we want to find some giggling girls, maybe we can get some, but I don't know.

1128
01:34:09,940 --> 01:34:11,940
Okay, here's my response.

1129
01:34:11,940 --> 01:34:14,940
I want to see what everyone thinks before I send it.

1130
01:34:14,940 --> 01:34:17,940
I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling...

1131
01:34:17,940 --> 01:34:19,940
First, Monkey Butler, okay?

1132
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:21,940
Okay.

1133
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,940
I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling me a giggling ditzy girl.

1134
01:34:25,940 --> 01:34:27,940
He said this about...

1135
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:29,940
I said my because, you know, we all did it.

1136
01:34:29,940 --> 01:34:30,940
Right, right. I know.

1137
01:34:30,940 --> 01:34:31,940
Podcast Orange Downs Radio.

1138
01:34:31,940 --> 01:34:35,220
another gaming podcast that sucks because for some reason they added a

1139
01:34:35,220 --> 01:34:37,740
ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle or an attempted joke

1140
01:34:37,740 --> 01:34:42,260
excuse me listen to the entire thing first I was not added I am a creator of

1141
01:34:42,260 --> 01:34:45,540
not only the podcast but of our three-hour live show which you've been

1142
01:34:45,540 --> 01:34:51,420
running for three years besides Rob is the giggling girl that's fine that's

1143
01:34:51,420 --> 01:34:56,060
fine and our chair once you post that our chat room wants a link to that oh

1144
01:34:56,060 --> 01:35:00,900
somebody actually found it that was nice wow look at our look at our listeners

1145
01:35:00,900 --> 01:35:05,380
Look at them go they they totally found that without us having to link them to it

1146
01:35:05,380 --> 01:35:09,160
They just got on the net and start searching and looking. Oh great. Now the listeners are gonna

1147
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:20,640
That's all right, just remember it's just some guy this is some stupid kid it's just some stupid kid

1148
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:29,820
Just be careful with what you say, of course then again, you know what what's the worst gonna happen more people decide to download our show

1149
01:35:29,820 --> 01:35:39,280
show damn damn alright our sky might want to mention also that we were voted

1153
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,120
open orange thumbs radio.com click on interact with us and right now our Skype

1154
01:35:59,120 --> 01:36:05,040
list is kind of interesting because it says 6 over 66 so six people are online

1155
01:36:05,040 --> 01:36:12,320
out of 66 that we have on our buddy list there on I don't know 666 get it anyway

1156
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,480
you know what's interesting though even though we are the best gaming podcast

1157
01:36:17,480 --> 01:36:22,640
according to the podcast words calm iTunes this week featured 16 gaming

1158
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:31,080
podcasts on their front page in a gamers strike back type category. Orange Lounge Radio, not

1159
01:36:31,080 --> 01:36:32,080
one of them.

1160
01:36:32,080 --> 01:36:35,000
Well, iTunes has so much wrong with it.

1161
01:36:35,000 --> 01:36:38,240
But, well, we were on there before as well, too, so at least we can say that. We were

1162
01:36:38,240 --> 01:36:42,400
on as an interesting indie a while ago, so we can't complain too much. We don't have

1163
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:46,120
the word game in our title. All right, Loki, hurry up your quick thought, because we got

1164
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:47,120
a call on the line, Loki.

1165
01:36:47,120 --> 01:36:48,120
No, go ahead, take the call.

1166
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:51,220
All right, we're going to take the call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1167
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:52,560
You already know who this is.

1168
01:36:52,560 --> 01:36:55,560
Of course. Hi, Zaku. How are you?

1169
01:36:55,560 --> 01:36:57,560
Fine. What time do you mind?

1170
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,560
Just seeing that DDR Strike is no joke now.

1171
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:04,560
Obviously, you already heard Love is Orange.

1172
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:06,560
That's all I have to say.

1173
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:09,560
Yep, Love is Orange is going to be in DDR Strike. Very interesting.

1174
01:37:09,560 --> 01:37:13,560
First, I mean, we finally got some Oni steps. Yay.

1175
01:37:13,560 --> 01:37:15,560
I think that's kind of cool as well.

1176
01:37:15,560 --> 01:37:21,560
You know, what could be interesting is that we haven't really heard of a lot of Konami originals

1177
01:37:21,560 --> 01:37:25,280
be an EX too, we've heard of all these licensed songs, we haven't heard a lot of Konami originals

1178
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,440
besides the one shown at E3.

1179
01:37:26,440 --> 01:37:32,120
Yeah, because Konami learned, you know, Konami learned that if stuff is leaked beforehand,

1180
01:37:32,120 --> 01:37:33,800
you know, people start bitching and moaning.

1181
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:34,800
Exactly.

1182
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,620
So that's why they're keeping it, yeah, that's why we haven't gotten, you know, that many

1183
01:37:37,620 --> 01:37:40,240
UltraMix 3 songs, you know, song names yet.

1184
01:37:40,240 --> 01:37:43,600
Zaku, I absolutely agree with you on that, believe it or not, I absolutely agree that

1185
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:44,600
that's the reason why Konami is really good.

1186
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:45,600
Konami's keeping it under wraps.

1187
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:48,240
They're keeping it under wraps so you don't bitch about it.

1188
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:49,240
Exactly.

1189
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,360
That's basically how you do it.

1190
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:56,280
You gotta, you know, you wait until the right moment, and in this case, DDR Stream 2 should

1191
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:59,920
be coming out next week, so then we'll probably know what's going to be on it.

1192
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,120
My god, is it really next week?

1193
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,120
Next week?

1194
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,120
Like, two weeks.

1195
01:38:04,120 --> 01:38:05,120
Yeah, I think it's the 27th.

1196
01:38:05,120 --> 01:38:06,120
Oh, okay, that's two weeks.

1197
01:38:06,120 --> 01:38:07,120
That's two weeks.

1198
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:08,120
By my calendar, it's two weeks.

1199
01:38:08,120 --> 01:38:13,920
It reminds me, I gotta give my, uh, call to have him send me a copy.

1200
01:38:13,920 --> 01:38:15,920
I thought it was 27th, come on.

1201
01:38:15,920 --> 01:38:18,740
Okay, yeah, but, I still, forget it, it doesn't matter.

1202
01:38:18,740 --> 01:38:25,740
It's coming out in nine days. Fair enough. It's coming out in nine days.

1203
01:38:25,820 --> 01:38:32,000
Which is technically next Tuesday. So, in other words, yeah, everything's looking

1204
01:38:32,000 --> 01:38:34,980
good. The only problem I had with Tokyo Game Show

1205
01:38:34,980 --> 01:38:38,940
was Nintendo Revolution Controller. Going off topic right now.

1206
01:38:38,940 --> 01:38:42,460
Okay, what's your thought on Nintendo Revolution Controller, because that's been something

1207
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:46,240
that we've talked about a little bit tonight. WTF. WTF.

1208
01:38:46,240 --> 01:38:53,960
You know, here it is, here it is Zaku, I think that in order to separate themselves from

1209
01:38:53,960 --> 01:38:58,220
Sony and Microsoft, they've got to take a gamble and try something different.

1210
01:38:58,220 --> 01:38:59,700
And I think that's what they're doing.

1211
01:38:59,700 --> 01:39:01,360
Is it going to be a good thing or a bad thing?

1212
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:02,400
I don't know.

1213
01:39:02,400 --> 01:39:04,040
Will they put Kid Icarus on it?

1214
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:08,480
That's my thing.

1215
01:39:08,480 --> 01:39:09,480
No I know, I know that.

1216
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:14,040
How would you play, I mean I could understand, I could understand the control being used

1217
01:39:14,040 --> 01:39:19,300
has a gun just for, you know, for shooter games, but, you know, fighting games, I really

1218
01:39:19,300 --> 01:39:21,400
need you, you really need something.

1219
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:26,360
Take the little sticky part that looks like a remote control, turn it 90 degrees, and

1220
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:31,000
it looks like an old, it looks just like an old school NES controller.

1221
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:32,000
Except thinner.

1222
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:38,040
Think about it, yeah, take the remote, seriously, and I credit absolutely darktetsuya with pointing

1223
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,040
his eyes out to me.

1224
01:39:39,040 --> 01:39:40,040
Take the remote, turn it 90 degrees.

1225
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:42,620
You want us to pull it sideways, oh my god.

1226
01:39:42,620 --> 01:39:43,620
So there you go.

1227
01:39:43,620 --> 01:39:46,620
As I said, I'm just going for PS3.

1228
01:39:46,620 --> 01:39:49,620
Money's, you know, all in there right now.

1229
01:39:49,620 --> 01:39:52,620
I'm actually, believe it or not, I'm picking up an Xbox 360.

1230
01:39:52,620 --> 01:39:54,620
I'm going to have all of them.

1231
01:39:54,620 --> 01:39:56,620
I know I will, too, eventually.

1232
01:39:56,620 --> 01:40:03,620
It's going to be really hard to hack PS3 because Blu-ray is pretty tight up the ass.

1233
01:40:03,620 --> 01:40:06,620
Blu-ray is going to be damn near impossible to crack.

1234
01:40:06,620 --> 01:40:08,620
But that's what they said about DVD.

1235
01:40:08,620 --> 01:40:09,620
I'm telling you, man.

1236
01:40:09,620 --> 01:40:12,620
That's what they said about DVD.

1237
01:40:12,620 --> 01:40:21,620
Yeah, but you know, from what we're seeing, it looks like they pretty much fixed all the loopholes that DVD had.

1238
01:40:21,620 --> 01:40:27,620
In other words, Blu-ray was supposed to be something a lot better than DVD.

1239
01:40:27,620 --> 01:40:33,620
It was supposed to be almost invincible and perfect in that sense.

1240
01:40:33,620 --> 01:40:35,620
But you know, not everything is perfect.

1241
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:38,620
Yeah, we'll see. If there is a way to crack it, somehow the hacking world will.

1242
01:40:38,620 --> 01:40:40,620
But we'll see, we'll see.

1243
01:40:40,620 --> 01:40:44,620
Okay, any other thoughts, Zaku? Because we've got to go pretty quick here so we can get some other people in before the cage matches.

1244
01:40:44,620 --> 01:40:45,620
Anything else?

1245
01:40:47,620 --> 01:40:48,620
Hello?

1246
01:40:48,620 --> 01:40:50,620
Yeah, I guess that's about it so far.

1247
01:40:50,620 --> 01:40:51,620
Alright then.

1248
01:40:51,620 --> 01:40:53,620
DDR Strike equals ONI. That's it.

1249
01:40:53,620 --> 01:40:55,620
Alright, we'll see. Have a good one, Zaku.

1250
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:57,620
DDR Extreme 2 next week. Let's go.

1251
01:40:57,620 --> 01:40:58,620
Alright.

1252
01:40:58,620 --> 01:40:59,620
Later.

1253
01:41:01,620 --> 01:41:02,620
That kid's fun.

1254
01:41:02,620 --> 01:41:03,620
Alright, let's go to another call here.

1255
01:41:03,620 --> 01:41:05,620
Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

1256
01:41:05,620 --> 01:41:07,620
Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

1257
01:41:07,620 --> 01:41:12,620
Hello, SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind?

1258
01:41:12,620 --> 01:41:15,620
I just wanted to talk about the revolution controller.

1259
01:41:15,620 --> 01:41:18,620
Alright, what's up? What's your thoughts on the revolution controller?

1260
01:41:18,620 --> 01:41:23,620
Just basically it looks like everyone's Smash Brothers skills are going to be thrown out the window at this point.

1261
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:31,620
But what about the little mock-up that Loki posted where you can plug the little remote thingy into a wave bird type controller?

1262
01:41:31,620 --> 01:41:33,620
I mean, that'll be just like a GameCube.

1263
01:41:33,620 --> 01:41:36,620
Do know that we can throw it out the window. We'll know when you throw it out the window.

1264
01:41:36,620 --> 01:41:45,620
I mean, it's possible, but you know, if you're gonna go to a tourney, you're just gonna see a lot of people just whaling around in remote control, trying to wave-dash.

1265
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:54,620
Yeah, but this is a Star Wars fan's dream right there, because the controller can be a lightsaber in future Star Wars games.

1266
01:41:54,620 --> 01:41:56,620
And then, you know, you can just go around that...

1267
01:41:56,620 --> 01:42:02,620
Then they'll have revolutionary controller, or Revolution Controller Kid videos going around.

1268
01:42:02,620 --> 01:42:09,620
around. You know what it looks like? It looks like a Star Trek phaser. Kinda. Whoa, old school

1269
01:42:12,060 --> 01:42:19,060
flashback time. What? Who remembers Die by the Sword? I don't. This first person hack

1270
01:42:19,960 --> 01:42:25,620
and slash game where you either use the mouse to control literally the sword arm and you

1271
01:42:25,620 --> 01:42:30,820
can just slice hack and slash with that sword by moving the mouse or with a joystick. I'm

1272
01:42:30,820 --> 01:42:38,820
I'm thinking there were going to be some damn good sword fighting games, like say that Dragon Warrior sword game that never came out in the U.S.

1273
01:42:38,820 --> 01:42:42,820
There could be a sword fighting game as a launch title.

1274
01:42:42,820 --> 01:42:47,820
But you can't make a system out of the Dragon Warrior game and Ikaruga style games. You can't do a system out of it.

1275
01:42:47,820 --> 01:42:49,820
I know, but the possibilities are endless.

1276
01:42:49,820 --> 01:42:50,820
Well, possibly.

1277
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:51,820
I hope.

1278
01:42:51,820 --> 01:42:57,820
Let's just call this what this is. This is what happens when, you know, the Power Glove has sex with the remote control.

1279
01:42:57,820 --> 01:42:59,820
The end. That's what it is.

1280
01:42:59,820 --> 01:43:03,820
You know what the Nintendo controller looks like to me?

1281
01:43:03,820 --> 01:43:07,820
Like, if you disconnected that one portion of it, it would look like a tampon.

1282
01:43:07,820 --> 01:43:11,820
Actually, with the little cord.

1283
01:43:11,820 --> 01:43:15,820
That doesn't look like a tampon.

1284
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:19,820
Tampons don't have two A and B buttons.

1285
01:43:19,820 --> 01:43:23,820
Forget it.

1286
01:43:23,820 --> 01:43:27,820
SSJ100, Matt, any other thoughts on things you've heard about at Tokyo Game Show?

1287
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:35,420
Well, like you, I'm also a little disappointed that the revolution may or may not have HD

1288
01:43:35,420 --> 01:43:36,420
capabilities on it.

1289
01:43:36,420 --> 01:43:39,500
You have caught me bitching about this in the forums incessantly, yes.

1290
01:43:39,500 --> 01:43:40,500
I was 480p.

1291
01:43:40,500 --> 01:43:46,940
Somebody had created something in the forums about the Nintendo revolution and the controller

1292
01:43:46,940 --> 01:43:49,700
and everything, and my immediate response was...

1293
01:43:49,700 --> 01:43:50,700
Was that you?

1294
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:51,700
I'm sorry.

1295
01:43:51,700 --> 01:43:55,660
My immediate response in the forum was something to the effect of, you know what, I don't care

1296
01:43:55,660 --> 01:43:56,660
about the controller.

1297
01:43:56,660 --> 01:44:01,740
bitch about Nintendo Revolution right now is that there's no HD support. And as somebody

1298
01:44:01,740 --> 01:44:09,620
who's an HDTV owner, as I think a lot of Americans will be over the next three years, what the

1299
01:44:09,620 --> 01:44:14,620
F? How can you be a next-gen system and not support the next-gen picture technology? I

1300
01:44:14,620 --> 01:44:16,220
do not understand that at all.

1301
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:20,900
Well, you know, praise... soon everything's going to be HD. I mean, I've actually shot

1302
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:22,400
on HD cameras.

1303
01:44:22,400 --> 01:44:23,400
Ooh, cool.

1304
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:24,400
So...

1305
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:25,400
I, I know, everything...

1306
01:44:25,400 --> 01:44:27,400
I mean, I actually use the same exact...

1307
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:28,400
You there?

1308
01:44:28,400 --> 01:44:29,400
Yeah, I'm here.

1309
01:44:29,400 --> 01:44:33,840
Just, I was just gonna say, just earlier tonight, um, my roommate was watching the Emmys pre-show

1310
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:35,880
on the HD channel.

1311
01:44:35,880 --> 01:44:39,480
Like, okay, who cares about Star Jones in HD?

1312
01:44:39,480 --> 01:44:42,600
But it's out there now, so soon everything will be on HD.

1313
01:44:42,600 --> 01:44:43,600
It's inevitable.

1314
01:44:43,600 --> 01:44:44,600
Yeah.

1315
01:44:44,600 --> 01:44:49,920
But, yeah, I've actually used the same exact camera that they used on, uh, Episode 3.

1316
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,920
Oh, very cool. Very cool.

1317
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:59,920
Yeah, so, HD is not really any much different than regular, like digital-wise it's fine, I mean.

1318
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:00,920
Right.

1319
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,920
But, I don't know.

1320
01:45:02,920 --> 01:45:06,920
You know, little known fact, I actually, when I was in college, I also studied television.

1321
01:45:06,920 --> 01:45:11,920
Television was my major, media arts, communication design was my major.

1322
01:45:11,920 --> 01:45:14,920
So I played a lot with cameras when I was in college too and did a lot of studio work, so.

1323
01:45:14,920 --> 01:45:15,920
Yeah.

1324
01:45:15,920 --> 01:45:17,920
And worked for a TV station for a short time, so.

1325
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:21,180
and i think that that's what i'm working on that

1326
01:45:21,180 --> 01:45:22,700
they go i mean actually

1327
01:45:22,700 --> 01:45:24,720

1328
01:45:24,720 --> 01:45:27,380
all that's right i remember reading everything

1329
01:45:27,380 --> 01:45:31,300
good luck with that if you'd if you'll get into work for the man you know don't

1330
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:33,620

1331
01:45:33,620 --> 01:45:36,300
well actually working for a tv show

1332
01:45:36,300 --> 01:45:40,200

01:45:40,200 --> 01:45:40,840

1338
01:45:47,680 --> 01:45:48,680
Uh, nope.

1339
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:49,680
Alright.

1340
01:45:49,680 --> 01:45:52,680
Well then we're gonna let you go, see if we get any other calls and move on to the

1341
01:45:52,680 --> 01:45:53,680
cage match.

1342
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:54,680
Alright?

1343
01:45:54,680 --> 01:45:55,680
Have a good one!

1344
01:45:55,680 --> 01:45:56,680
Yup, you too, bye.

1345
01:45:56,680 --> 01:45:57,680
Later.

1346
01:45:57,680 --> 01:46:02,160
Alright, more feedback there on the Nintendo Revolution controller, and uh, a lot, a lot

1347
01:46:02,160 --> 01:46:05,840
of people, just on the blogging scene out there, everybody that's got some type of

1348
01:46:05,840 --> 01:46:10,560
gaming blog in one way or another has some...

1349
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,560
What guy?

1350
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:12,560
What guy?

1351
01:46:12,560 --> 01:46:13,560
He's not online right now.

1352
01:46:13,560 --> 01:46:14,560
That's you!

1353
01:46:14,560 --> 01:46:15,560
Oh no, me?

1354
01:46:15,560 --> 01:46:24,000
I don't see any other calls coming in, so I think we're going to go ahead and we don't

1355
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,520
want to run too behind in the show anyway.

1356
01:46:25,520 --> 01:46:34,400
We got to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1357
01:46:34,400 --> 01:46:37,080
The Orange Lounge Radio cage match here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1358
01:46:37,080 --> 01:46:41,480
We're going to play three songs back to back, and you're going to vote for your favorite

1359
01:46:41,480 --> 01:46:46,920
song which will go into rotation all week long here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1360
01:46:46,920 --> 01:46:51,340
Our Bamani and video game music show, which plays 24 hours a day, 7 days a week on this

1361
01:46:51,340 --> 01:46:53,220
station when we are not live.

1362
01:46:53,220 --> 01:46:57,880
Alright, last week in the Orange Lounge Radio cage match, it was a very close cage match,

1363
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:03,840
but in the end, Good Cool won it with just a couple votes over some of the other songs

1364
01:47:03,840 --> 01:47:05,400
that were in last week's cage match.

1365
01:47:05,400 --> 01:47:08,880
And it's a trance mix of blame, and it was Loki's pick, so that's the first song we're

1366
01:47:08,880 --> 01:47:09,880
going to hear tonight.

1367
01:47:09,880 --> 01:47:13,880
Again, as a reminder, you only hear a clip of last week's winner because it's assumed

1368
01:47:13,880 --> 01:47:16,400
that you've already heard the song in its entirety.

1369
01:47:16,400 --> 01:47:19,760
And then we're going to play two more songs for you guys in full.

1370
01:47:19,760 --> 01:47:24,280
You guys have to be in the chat room to vote, orangeontradio.com, click on chat, and let's

1371
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:30,000
get it started here with a clip of song number one, Good Cool, with Chorus K, featuring Jeff

1372
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:32,000
Coot with Blame, the trance mix.

1373
01:48:00,000 --> 01:48:07,000
You have left me sad for life, I've been away just like a night

1374
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:14,000
I can't forgive it for you

1375
01:48:37,000 --> 01:48:50,640
Keep it in my mind, I will always find emotion still with me

1376
01:48:50,640 --> 01:48:56,800
Oh my heart still yearns, can't abide still, but I can't put up the pain

1377
01:48:56,800 --> 01:49:02,800
I would never, ever assume to leave me with a mental boost

1378
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:08,800
You don't believe that's why I can't forget about the day

1379
01:49:08,800 --> 01:49:15,800
You never did not look like something that was just like a day

1380
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:21,800
I can't forget about the day

1381
01:49:21,800 --> 01:49:27,600
I would never, ever seem to need me with a mental wound

1382
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:33,800
To know the reason why I can't forgive and forget

1383
01:49:33,800 --> 01:49:40,300
You have left me sad for life, consider what's not my goodnight

1384
01:49:40,300 --> 01:49:46,800
I can't forgive and forget

1385
01:49:46,800 --> 01:50:08,900
Alrighty, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.

1386
01:50:08,900 --> 01:50:12,000
That was Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Koot with Blame.

1387
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:16,120
Let's get into some new songs and see what kind of competition Blame has tonight.

1388
01:50:16,120 --> 01:50:18,620
The first one is Dark Sakura's pick.

1389
01:50:18,620 --> 01:50:21,700
Dark Sakura, what did you pick and why?

1390
01:50:21,700 --> 01:50:26,760
I really like Long Good Midnight Maximum Tune a whole bunch and the music in it is awesome.

1391
01:50:26,760 --> 01:50:31,240
This one is Yuzu Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

1392
01:50:31,240 --> 01:50:33,120
It's just a really cool song.

1393
01:50:33,120 --> 01:50:36,760
Alright, so this was not in tonight's pre-show because this is from the first game, right?

1394
01:50:36,760 --> 01:50:37,960
This is on the first soundtrack.

1395
01:50:37,960 --> 01:50:38,960
Alright.

1396
01:50:38,960 --> 01:50:39,960
The first CD.

1397
01:50:39,960 --> 01:50:40,960
Sounds good.

1398
01:50:40,960 --> 01:50:42,960
Yuzu Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

1399
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:43,960
Enjoy.

1400
01:50:43,960 --> 01:50:47,960
Be quiet, I know it from all of me

1401
01:50:50,960 --> 01:50:52,960
Destiny set this new record

1402
01:50:54,960 --> 01:50:56,960
1, 2, 3, 4

1403
01:50:56,960 --> 01:51:09,960
1, 2, 3, 4.

1404
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:13,960
Music

1405
01:52:13,960 --> 01:52:17,960
Music

1406
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:24,960
Music

1407
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,960
Three, two, one, go!

1408
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:34,960
Once again, now!

1409
01:52:43,960 --> 01:52:44,960
Go for it!

1410
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:46,960
One, two, three, four.

1411
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:39,740
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,

1412
01:54:39,740 --> 01:54:43,740
Is it true?

1413
01:54:43,740 --> 01:54:48,740
Enjoy the truth

1414
01:54:48,740 --> 01:54:53,740
Victory

1415
01:54:53,740 --> 01:54:57,740
Is it true?

1416
01:54:57,740 --> 01:55:02,740
Once you get down

1417
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:03,740
One, two, three, four.

1418
01:55:03,740 --> 01:55:05,740
1, 2, 3, 4.

1419
01:55:33,740 --> 01:55:42,300
Song number two in tonight's cage match, Yuzo Koshiro from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

1420
01:55:42,300 --> 01:55:44,260
That was Destination Blackout.

1421
01:55:44,260 --> 01:55:45,500
What did you kids think of that?

1422
01:55:45,500 --> 01:55:46,500
We'll start off with Dark Sakura.

1423
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:52,300
Yeah, I'm normally not a trans person at all, but this made me think of almost like taking

1424
01:55:52,300 --> 01:55:55,020
symphonic music and simping it up.

1425
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:56,020
And I really like it.

1426
01:55:56,020 --> 01:55:57,020
I really, really like it.

1427
01:55:57,020 --> 01:55:58,020
I love all the music in the game.

1428
01:55:58,020 --> 01:56:02,820
It's a lot more fun to play that game stat instead of Eurobeat, so it gets a 9.5.

1429
01:56:02,820 --> 01:56:07,820
9.5 out of 10. He's a musical hero, he's like, he did a bunch of classic gaming music too.

1430
01:56:07,820 --> 01:56:12,820
Yeah, he's the real kind of big name in the gaming music scene right now.

1431
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:17,820
Loki, what'd you think? It was a good song, it just wasn't one of my favorites on that CD.

1432
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:22,820
It gets like an 8. Nate from Loki, Bugged, what'd you think of that one?

1433
01:56:22,820 --> 01:56:27,820
What were we, what? The song that you just heard, Destination Blackout.

1434
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:31,820
Angel. Jackass. Angel.

1435
01:56:31,820 --> 01:56:35,820
Good stuff.

1436
01:56:35,820 --> 01:56:39,820
Nine.

1437
01:56:39,820 --> 01:56:43,820
Maybe I could give it a nine.

1438
01:56:43,820 --> 01:56:47,820
I'm used to hearing it all the time.

1439
01:56:47,820 --> 01:56:51,820
I don't know. I like it, but I hear too much of it.

1440
01:56:51,820 --> 01:56:55,820
I'll try to be unbiased. Nine.

1441
01:56:55,820 --> 01:57:17,820
I liked it, it was cool, it was the kind of song, it did get a little bit repetitive, which is odd because a lot of trans is repetitive, but it got a little repetitive for me, but it was like a cool song, like I could imagine myself driving down the road to that song, except I would want guns on my car, like in Spy Hunter, and I'm kind of frustrated that I don't actually have guns on my car, so, um, all in all, I don't know why I brought that up, but I just, I want to be able to shoot things for my car.

1442
01:57:17,820 --> 01:57:20,820
Well, if you do have guns in your car, you're gonna want the Peter Gunn theme.

1443
01:57:50,820 --> 01:57:55,320
You know what? I think that we should have something else, you know, something else in the cage match.

1444
01:57:55,320 --> 01:58:02,320
So I went really kind of random tonight, and this is a brand new synth-pop song that's on a different drum site,

1445
01:58:02,320 --> 01:58:06,020
and so I had to check this one out, and it's not in English, so it should be interesting.

1446
01:58:06,020 --> 01:58:24,340
this is silica gel with nada es eterno here on orange lounge radio song number three

1447
01:59:06,020 --> 01:59:20,020
Creví bilida, tus pesos llanos son mi morfina Sí esta puede su, no se quienso Y nunca te conocí

1448
01:59:20,020 --> 01:59:29,020
Nada se tieno, alguemos pece Nada es perfecto

1449
01:59:29,020 --> 01:59:35,520
Nada se tengo, todas tambre, y alguerre cuerdo

1450
01:59:37,520 --> 01:59:40,520
¡Alguerre cuerdo!

1451
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:52,020
Evolados, las promesas y los sueños

1452
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:58,860
Sólo puedo un sueños, nos creimos, sueños de la entire

1453
01:59:58,860 --> 02:00:07,140
Un camo está poder con todarlo, nuestra pida, puedo una caler

1454
02:00:07,140 --> 02:00:15,100
En mundos paleros y estandes, no vuardere encor, no cómber que mi fe,

1455
02:00:15,100 --> 02:00:17,100
Oh

1456
02:00:45,100 --> 02:00:47,100
No

1457
02:01:45,100 --> 02:02:05,860
All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, Silica Gel with Nada Es Eterno.

1458
02:02:05,860 --> 02:02:09,780
Let's see what the host thought of that one, Dark Sakura.

1459
02:02:09,780 --> 02:02:14,300
What bothered me is I couldn't tell what language that was in because I didn't know if it was

1460
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:16,300
Spanish or Italian?

1461
02:02:16,300 --> 02:02:19,300
We're pretty sure it's Spanish. I think it's Spanish, but...

1462
02:02:19,300 --> 02:02:24,300
But either way, I was baffled, and so bafflement takes the one from the score.

1463
02:02:24,300 --> 02:02:26,300
It was pretty good, though, overall.

1464
02:02:26,300 --> 02:02:28,300
Um, so I guess an eight.

1465
02:02:28,300 --> 02:02:30,300
An eight! Loki!

1466
02:02:30,300 --> 02:02:32,300
Um...

1467
02:02:32,300 --> 02:02:34,300
Ocho, from Dark Sakura. I don't know.

1468
02:02:34,300 --> 02:02:36,300
Ocho.

1469
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:38,300
I didn't really care for it. It's seven.

1470
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,300
Okay, Siete.

1471
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:42,300
From, uh...

1472
02:02:42,300 --> 02:02:54,700
I'm gonna buck the trend here, um, I'm giving it an 8, it was pretty good, pretty catchy,

1473
02:02:54,700 --> 02:02:58,660
uh, pretty, uh, pretty lively.

1474
02:02:58,660 --> 02:02:59,660
Ocho!

1475
02:02:59,660 --> 02:03:00,660
From, uh...

1476
02:03:00,660 --> 02:03:04,440
I hate you.

1477
02:03:04,440 --> 02:03:05,440
From Te...

1478
02:03:05,440 --> 02:03:06,440
Uh...

1479
02:03:06,440 --> 02:03:07,440
Bente Teres?

1480
02:03:07,440 --> 02:03:08,440
I think?

1481
02:03:08,440 --> 02:03:09,440
Bente Teres?

1482
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,440
Magus?

1483
02:03:10,440 --> 02:03:11,440
Alright.

1484
02:03:11,440 --> 02:03:13,440
Uh, Nueve for me. Nueve, I like it.

1485
02:03:13,440 --> 02:03:19,440
The only language I can count in other than English, well, other than like Apple Map, is German.

1486
02:03:19,440 --> 02:03:28,440
I like that song, it was cool, so it gets a nod. I think it's just kinda, it's very like, it's got a strong beat to it. I like the strong beat in that song.

1487
02:03:28,440 --> 02:03:39,440
Alright! Let's um, go and uh, see what the chatroom thought by allowing them to vote after this quick montage of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

1488
02:03:39,440 --> 02:03:55,440

1493
02:04:41,380 --> 02:04:46,140
Meanwhile, we get into the part of the show where Loki tells us what's going on in the

1494
02:04:46,140 --> 02:04:50,680
simulation scene, that's right, the Dance Dance Revolution simulation scene and other

1495
02:04:50,680 --> 02:04:56,680
music games where you can download and simulate the music games for free on your PC.

1496
02:04:56,680 --> 02:04:57,680
Damn straight.

1497
02:04:57,680 --> 02:05:03,320
Of course, what we've been waiting for, Food Mix 2 has arrived.

1498
02:05:03,320 --> 02:05:06,320
It's unfortunately only in one format.

1499
02:05:06,320 --> 02:05:13,860
You can only download it in a set with basically Food Mix 1, Food Mix Plus, and Food Mix 2.

1500
02:05:13,860 --> 02:05:21,780
that's a 1.2 gig download for you. Wait, so it's Food Mix 1? Yeah, it's 1 plus and 2.

1501
02:05:21,780 --> 02:05:27,560
Wow, okay. And basically what they've done is they've changed all the animations in the

1502
02:05:27,560 --> 02:05:32,300
background to just one video clip now instead of having all the fancy stuff that they were

1503
02:05:32,300 --> 02:05:38,900
doing before. But, I have to say it's really cool. The music this time around though, a

1504
02:05:38,900 --> 02:05:48,900
A lot of it I'm not too... I don't like it too much, but it's pretty good still. And the animation is just amazing. They've really just outdone themselves.

1505
02:05:48,900 --> 02:05:57,900
And the other thing though is they have a bunch of really strange stuff that's in there. It kind of reminded me of old Moogle Hunter sim files.

1506
02:05:57,900 --> 02:06:07,900
Just really, really strange stuff that catches you off guard, like steps appearing out of nowhere and stuff like that. So, it's interesting. You gotta check it out.

1507
02:06:07,900 --> 02:06:13,900
And we have the link on our front page there, so definitely go check it out.

1508
02:06:13,900 --> 02:06:16,900
Alright, check that out.

1509
02:06:16,900 --> 02:06:22,900
Also on the front page of OrangeLawnTrader.com, something we hadn't mentioned yet until this point in the show,

1510
02:06:22,900 --> 02:06:24,900
but I definitely want to make sure we get that out there.

1511
02:06:24,900 --> 02:06:30,900
It's something that we actually teamed up with another audio company in Sacramento, Dark Records.

1512
02:06:30,900 --> 02:06:33,900
And also Club 21, Rapture.

1513
02:06:33,900 --> 02:06:35,900
Absolutely, Club 21, Rapture.

1514
02:06:35,900 --> 02:06:41,200
We're teaming up to do a fundraiser relief for Hurricane Katrina.

1515
02:06:41,200 --> 02:06:45,260
And kind of the concept behind this fundraiser is that we're not just trying to raise money

1516
02:06:45,260 --> 02:06:52,440
for the human need, but also the pet and animal need is kind of the little spin we're putting

1517
02:06:52,440 --> 02:06:53,440
on it.

1518
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:58,420
Because I don't remember if it was you or Iguana Girl from DDR Freak slash Dark Record

1519
02:06:58,420 --> 02:07:04,860
she works on as well that originally found the story on the pets that were being neglected

1520
02:07:04,860 --> 02:07:05,860
due to the hurricane.

1521
02:07:05,860 --> 02:07:12,300
I had been following the pets myself, but she actually found the link on the Sacramento

1522
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:17,420
SPCA website.

1523
02:07:17,420 --> 02:07:25,780
And they were taking donations of pet food, grooming items, any type of animal care items,

1524
02:07:25,780 --> 02:07:33,060
bedding, to give to the shelters, to the people who were housing, who were providing foster

1525
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:40,600
homes for displaced pets, and that it's a lot easier for people who may not have a whole

1526
02:07:40,600 --> 02:07:44,780
lot of money to contribute in food.

1527
02:07:44,780 --> 02:07:53,060
Also we are, though, taking monetary donations for the human survivors as well.

1528
02:07:53,060 --> 02:07:54,460
Did you already post the link?

1529
02:07:54,460 --> 02:07:56,900
Well, if you visit orangemonitor.com, you can't miss it.

1530
02:07:56,900 --> 02:07:57,900
There's a huge banner.

1531
02:07:57,900 --> 02:07:58,900
It's right up at the top.

1532
02:07:58,900 --> 02:07:59,900
It's right up at the top.

1533
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:07,320
They're taking donations via PayPal on the Dark Records site that's set up for the collection.

1534
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:14,240
Anyone in the Sacramento area, if you go to Club 21 on Thursday nights for Rapture, which

1535
02:08:14,240 --> 02:08:21,780
is the goth industrial night, there are donation boxes around for physical items as well as

1536
02:08:21,780 --> 02:08:23,280
monetary donations.

1537
02:08:23,280 --> 02:08:27,580
The physical items at the end of the month, by the way, we're taking anything.

1538
02:08:27,580 --> 02:08:36,020
We're having a massive ghetto garage sale, and we are going to be selling off this stuff

1539
02:08:36,020 --> 02:08:40,760
to the community, and the money is going to be going directly to the Red Cross.

1540
02:08:40,760 --> 02:08:46,580
The leftover items are all going to the Salvation Army Thrift Store, so everything donated will

1541
02:08:46,580 --> 02:08:48,620
be put to use.

1542
02:08:48,620 --> 02:08:54,340
And if you have something specifically for animals, if the money you want to give or

1543
02:08:54,340 --> 02:08:58,940
items in particular you know you can leave a comment this is for the animals

1544
02:08:58,940 --> 02:09:06,140
by pet supplies with this okay great but we really are you know even if all

1545
02:09:06,140 --> 02:09:10,980
you can give is a dollar that's a dollar more that people are going to have to

1546
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:13,860
buy food and and on top of that the thing that I'm actually getting pretty

1547
02:09:13,860 --> 02:09:17,020
pleased with the Red Cross they're cracking down on those people who were

1548
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:21,940
using those debit cards to buy you know Louis Vuitton bags that pissed me off so

1549
02:09:21,940 --> 02:09:26,800
much but they're cracking down on that they're really trying to make sure that

1550
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:35,260
the money is being used for things that are needed. Yes so now you know it's it's

1551
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:40,060
a little easier if you're in the local area to really get involved with this by

1552
02:09:40,060 --> 02:09:44,900
you know going out to club rapture checking out the the garage sale that

1553
02:09:44,900 --> 02:09:47,380
we're gonna do that we have more information on later on not just

1554
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:51,620
Sacramento but you know our neighboring areas as well Bay Area Stockton Modesto

1555
02:09:51,620 --> 02:09:55,380
those areas as well can certainly get in on this. Our worldwide folks, though, because

1556
02:09:55,380 --> 02:09:59,220
we know we have a lot of people that listen through, you know, obviously our live show

1557
02:09:59,220 --> 02:10:05,260
as well as the podcast, we do have that monetary donation thing basically set up just for you

1558
02:10:05,260 --> 02:10:08,900
guys so that you guys can get involved in this as well. So we really hope, you know,

1559
02:10:08,900 --> 02:10:12,380
obviously we don't want to force you guys, but think about it. It's a good cause.

1560
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:15,500
And I'll tell you what, if you want to send something to donate, you know, if you want

1561
02:10:15,500 --> 02:10:21,300
to send pet supplies our way, email me. I'll get you my address.

1562
02:10:21,300 --> 02:10:23,620
Or you could just contact your local SPCA, too.

1563
02:10:23,620 --> 02:10:24,620
You could do that, too.

1564
02:10:24,620 --> 02:10:25,620
See if you're doing something similar.

1565
02:10:25,620 --> 02:10:32,060
As long as the money or the items go to help, that's all we're interested in.

1566
02:10:32,060 --> 02:10:33,060
Absolutely.

1567
02:10:33,060 --> 02:10:34,620
All right, so check that out on orangeonshooter.com.

1568
02:10:34,620 --> 02:10:37,780
We'll be mentioning that again every week until this is over, because this is an important

1569
02:10:37,780 --> 02:10:38,780
cause.

1570
02:10:38,780 --> 02:10:39,780
Absolutely.

1571
02:10:39,780 --> 02:10:42,180
All right, we're going to go to a break, guys, and I'm going to tally up the votes from the

1572
02:10:42,180 --> 02:10:43,180
cage match.

1573
02:10:43,180 --> 02:10:46,420
So it is last call for cage match votes, last call for cage match votes.

1574
02:10:46,420 --> 02:10:50,220
And we're going to go to our break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of

1575
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:54,940
cage match and we'll do the FUs of the week when we come back and who knows what else

1576
02:10:54,940 --> 02:10:55,940
is on our mind.

1577
02:10:55,940 --> 02:10:56,940
Loki.

1578
02:10:56,940 --> 02:11:03,300
I was just going to mention that my copy of In the Groove is coming and for all those

1579
02:11:03,300 --> 02:11:06,260
people that are like concerned, oh, has he changed his mind?

1580
02:11:06,260 --> 02:11:07,260
No.

1581
02:11:07,260 --> 02:11:11,900
This is the one that I'm writing This Game Sucks on and it will be given away.

1582
02:11:11,900 --> 02:11:14,660
So Loki will be writing This Game Sucks on a copy of In the Groove.

1583
02:11:14,660 --> 02:11:18,540
Now remember, the opinions of Loki do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Lawn's

1584
02:11:18,540 --> 02:11:23,980
radio or its staff. It's Loki's opinion. He's going to write this game sucks on the game,

1585
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:24,980
but hey, free game.

1586
02:11:24,980 --> 02:11:27,980
I share the opinion.

1587
02:11:27,980 --> 02:11:33,700
I'm not totally like-minded. I halfway share the opinion. There's half I like and half

1588
02:11:33,700 --> 02:11:35,140
I don't like, so I halfway share the opinion.

1589
02:11:35,140 --> 02:11:36,620
I might chew on the manual a bit.

1590
02:11:36,620 --> 02:11:42,060
I would put this game kind of sucks. How about this? This game could be better, is what I

1591
02:11:42,060 --> 02:11:43,060
would write. This game could be better.

1592
02:11:43,060 --> 02:11:44,620
I want to burn part of the manual.

1593
02:11:44,620 --> 02:11:45,620
All right. Anyway.

1594
02:11:45,620 --> 02:11:46,620
We'll be allowed on it.

1595
02:11:46,620 --> 02:11:52,620
Okay, kids, we'll be giving that away. So free game, whether you like it in the group or not, free game, and we're giving it away.

1596
02:11:52,620 --> 02:11:54,620
I will personally run over the box with my car for you.

1597
02:11:54,620 --> 02:12:01,620
Alright, okay. We're going to break. We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1598
02:12:01,620 --> 02:12:03,620
Let's start off with some colors from 2DX.

1599
02:13:01,620 --> 02:13:03,620
I

1600
02:15:31,620 --> 02:16:01,300
Every time I lose my self-control It feels like I can't let you go

1601
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:05,300
I'm at the point of no return

1602
02:16:08,300 --> 02:16:11,800
Don't ever wanna come back down

1603
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:15,300
I'm not so high above the ground

1604
02:16:15,300 --> 02:16:19,300
This feeling I will always feel

1605
02:16:21,300 --> 02:16:23,300
Keep taking away

1606
02:16:23,300 --> 02:16:28,300
I'm flying, I'm gonna head for paradise

1607
02:16:28,300 --> 02:16:30,300
Nothing to say

1608
02:16:30,300 --> 02:16:35,300
I'm cryin' and I wanna feel my fear tonight

1609
02:17:30,300 --> 02:17:56,620
Lookin' back when I was a child and dreamin'

1610
02:17:56,620 --> 02:18:00,620
Looking back when I was your child and dream

1611
02:18:00,620 --> 02:18:04,620
Oh damn, I'm sure that you would tell it to me

1612
02:18:04,620 --> 02:18:10,620
Every finger would set me free and fly away

1613
02:18:12,620 --> 02:18:16,620
Looking back when I was on chat and dream

1614
02:18:16,620 --> 02:18:20,620
Oh damn, I'm sure that you would come to me

1615
02:18:20,620 --> 02:18:27,620
I've been facing you, save me free, and fly away to everywhere

1616
02:18:27,620 --> 02:18:31,620
I could do anything

1617
02:18:33,620 --> 02:18:39,620
I can get up and I want

1618
02:18:39,620 --> 02:18:45,620
I get up and I want

1619
02:18:45,620 --> 02:18:51,000
Hey then, looking back when I was on Chet and Blaine

1620
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:54,940
Those are my changes to come to mean

1621
02:18:54,940 --> 02:19:01,340
The first one and it's ready, I'll fly away

1622
02:19:01,340 --> 02:19:05,120
Like you're so beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1623
02:19:05,120 --> 02:19:06,240
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1624
02:19:06,240 --> 02:19:08,160
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1625
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:10,380
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful

1626
02:19:10,380 --> 02:19:25,740
After all, I've come to be a man.

1627
02:19:25,740 --> 02:19:30,900
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

1628
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:34,900
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

1629
02:19:34,900 --> 02:19:40,140
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

1630
02:19:40,140 --> 02:19:41,380
We're back, kids.

1631
02:19:41,380 --> 02:19:42,620
Did you miss us?

1632
02:19:42,620 --> 02:19:43,660
Orange Montreuil.

1633
02:19:43,660 --> 02:19:46,700
Here, shut up, in studio.

1634
02:19:46,700 --> 02:19:49,980
In that break, colors, quickening, drifting.

1635
02:19:49,980 --> 02:19:51,780
I didn't even realize I inadvertently

1636
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:54,900
put two Taka songs back to back, but whatever, deal.

1637
02:19:54,900 --> 02:19:59,060
Drifting Away and Beautiful Days by the one and only Fantastic

1638
02:19:59,060 --> 02:20:00,020
Plastic Machine.

1639
02:20:00,020 --> 02:20:02,940
I went through a, I found Fantastic Plastic

1640
02:20:02,940 --> 02:20:06,740
Machines doing something that's on a compilation that's

1641
02:20:06,740 --> 02:20:09,260
got gorillas on it, too, I think.

1642
02:20:09,260 --> 02:20:10,260
You nerd.

1643
02:20:10,260 --> 02:20:15,380
But I saw it on something else, um, though, another, it's like some, something that Fantastic

1644
02:20:15,380 --> 02:20:20,260
Plastic Machine's doing with, crap, and it was at Target, and it wasn't Gorillaz, actually,

1645
02:20:20,260 --> 02:20:22,140
it was, I was looking for another compilation.

1646
02:20:22,140 --> 02:20:23,140
How about if it's Target?

1647
02:20:23,140 --> 02:20:24,140
I want it.

1648
02:20:24,140 --> 02:20:25,140
It wasn't Target, it was at Best Buy.

1649
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:26,140
Target is so sexy.

1650
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:27,140
Well, fuck Best Buy.

1651
02:20:27,140 --> 02:20:28,140
No, I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

1652
02:20:28,140 --> 02:20:29,140
I buy, I buy stuff at Best Buy.

1653
02:20:29,140 --> 02:20:32,300
But I can't remember what it was, but it was another Fantastic Plastic Machine song on

1654
02:20:32,300 --> 02:20:34,440
this random compilation, I almost bought it.

1655
02:20:34,440 --> 02:20:37,440
It sounds like good music for commercials, really.

1656
02:20:37,440 --> 02:20:42,400
The whole CD, though, the beautiful CD by Fantastic Plastic Machine, is just interesting.

1657
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:44,680
But it has taped me to the disco on it. That's almost cool.

1658
02:20:44,680 --> 02:20:46,000
I won Cage Match with that once.

1659
02:20:46,000 --> 02:20:47,520
You did?

1660
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:49,360
Let's find out who won tonight's Cage Match, shall we?

1661
02:20:49,360 --> 02:20:52,160
I remember that banner. That's the awesomest banner.

1662
02:20:52,160 --> 02:20:56,120
I'm going through all my old banners, and I found one that I made for Rob with Bob Barker on it.

1663
02:20:56,120 --> 02:20:57,880
And it says, The Sky Is Right.

1664
02:20:57,880 --> 02:20:59,520
I had that font, though.

1665
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:00,280
It's great.

1666
02:21:00,280 --> 02:21:04,640
The only reason I don't use that anymore is because now I horror Orange Lounge Radio and my banners on all the websites.

1667
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:06,760
I still have to see him before he dies.

1668
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:09,760
Bob Barker, next year before E3, since you get to go now.

1669
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:12,760
I can't go before E3, remember.

1670
02:21:12,760 --> 02:21:16,760
And there's a lot of stipulations because I'm getting married before E3 before.

1671
02:21:16,760 --> 02:21:18,760
Bitch!

1672
02:21:18,760 --> 02:21:20,760
I'm kidding, I love Nellie.

1673
02:21:20,760 --> 02:21:25,760
But what a bitch!

1674
02:21:25,760 --> 02:21:29,760
You know, I'm gonna be lucky if I get to go this time.

1675
02:21:29,760 --> 02:21:31,760
I know, I know.

1676
02:21:31,760 --> 02:21:37,360
Hey, nobody's making you get married, except maybe your fiance.

1677
02:21:37,360 --> 02:21:38,360
I should be like...

1678
02:21:38,360 --> 02:21:41,680
I don't see why you can't do the cheap DMV style one like me and Dan did.

1679
02:21:41,680 --> 02:21:44,520
Cause she doesn't want a cheap DMV style one.

1680
02:21:44,520 --> 02:21:46,160
It was only $114.

1681
02:21:46,160 --> 02:21:50,320
Alright, let's get to tonight's cage match winner since Dark Sakura brought up the cage

1682
02:21:50,320 --> 02:21:51,600
match.

1683
02:21:51,600 --> 02:21:52,720
Did she win it again?

1684
02:21:52,720 --> 02:21:53,720
Let's see.

1685
02:21:53,720 --> 02:21:54,720
I won it last time.

1686
02:21:54,720 --> 02:21:58,160
I know, but I'm saying again as in cause she had that fantastic plastic machine.

1687
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:01,000
What, 130 episodes ago that won it.

1688
02:22:01,000 --> 02:22:06,040
all right anyway um tonight actually it was kind of a landslide vote one song really took

1689
02:22:06,040 --> 02:22:12,000
the majority of the votes um kind of close second place very distant third tonight's

1690
02:22:12,000 --> 02:22:20,600
winner was destination blackout

1691
02:22:20,600 --> 02:22:26,880
handful of votes though for song number one blame not so many votes for nada es eterno

1692
02:22:26,880 --> 02:22:29,960
I guess you guys just aren't feeling the love.

1693
02:22:29,960 --> 02:22:32,560
All right, so Dark Soccer wins tonight's cage match.

1694
02:22:32,560 --> 02:22:34,560
She doesn't have to pick a new song last week.

1695
02:22:34,560 --> 02:22:36,120
That means I can sleep in next week.

1696
02:22:36,120 --> 02:22:40,560
I don't think I've won a cage match now in about three months.

1697
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:42,040
So I'm getting mad.

1698
02:22:42,040 --> 02:22:43,600
You should pick a better song.

1699
02:22:43,600 --> 02:22:44,800
You can suck my dick.

1700
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:45,320
All right.

1701
02:22:45,320 --> 02:22:47,320
Something is really fucked up.

1702
02:22:47,320 --> 02:22:49,880
Well, last week was supposed to be the fucked up thing,

1703
02:22:49,880 --> 02:22:52,480
but it got a ton of votes.

1704
02:22:52,480 --> 02:22:54,520
All three songs last week were very close.

1705
02:22:54,520 --> 02:22:55,860
It very narrowly lost.

1706
02:22:55,860 --> 02:22:58,260
So now I'm just going to have to get really, really fucked up.

1707
02:22:58,260 --> 02:23:01,480
Like, I have another song that is just, it's god-awful bad.

1708
02:23:01,480 --> 02:23:04,760
It is, it's the worst thing I've found on the iTunes music store.

1709
02:23:04,760 --> 02:23:09,640
And I'm going to play it next week, I think, out of spite for our listeners.

1710
02:23:09,640 --> 02:23:11,280
But at least my song got a couple votes.

1711
02:23:11,280 --> 02:23:12,320
That makes me happy.

1712
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:15,200
At least I got a couple votes, so I'm not as mad.

1713
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:17,360
All right.

1714
02:23:17,360 --> 02:23:20,240
DarkSakura, we've been teasing this a little bit throughout tonight's show.

1715
02:23:20,240 --> 02:23:23,480
You have gotten yourself into a brand new MMO.

1716
02:23:23,480 --> 02:23:24,600
What is it?

1717
02:23:24,600 --> 02:23:36,600
I'm playing World of Warcraft. World of Warcraft, sucker. About time one of us did. I know, World of Warcraft is a huge game and nobody's really, none of the three of us have really gotten into it yet. It's so pretty. Yeah, I heard it's a pretty game.

1718
02:23:36,600 --> 02:23:48,600
What made you decide you want to start playing World of Warcraft? Cause I know a bunch of people who play it. Yeah? And it's not Final Fantasy XI. Hey now, watch it, watch it. I'm sorry, I gave Final Fantasy XI a humongous try. I know.

1719
02:23:48,600 --> 02:23:53,880
and I hated being forced into hanging out with a bunch of people that I didn't know

1720
02:23:53,880 --> 02:23:57,360
and healing their stupid ungrateful asses

1721
02:23:57,360 --> 02:24:00,960
That's people's major bitch about Final Fantasy XI is the forced farting

1722
02:24:00,960 --> 02:24:04,840
I don't have to do that in World of Warcraft and if I played a hunter I can have a pet crocodile

1723
02:24:04,840 --> 02:24:08,960
Croggies! It's a pet crocodile!

1724
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:13,320
Who was that guy, the crocodile hunter that had his movie? What?

1725
02:24:13,320 --> 02:24:17,080
Erwin!

1726
02:24:17,080 --> 02:24:23,080
I'm playing a night elf druid, because I want to turn into a kitty.

1727
02:24:23,080 --> 02:24:29,080
That's really it. I was like, ooh, I can turn into a cat. Okay, I think it's cool.

1728
02:24:29,080 --> 02:24:38,080
And Magus, who's been playing World of Warcraft for a while, is over there going, don't do that, it sucks. It sucks.

1729
02:24:38,080 --> 02:24:41,080
Seriously, cat form sucks. It's a scammer.

1730
02:24:41,080 --> 02:24:48,080
But it looked like druids have a lot of neat stuff that they can do later on, so I'm looking forward to it.

1731
02:25:11,080 --> 02:25:22,080
See, yes exactly. Burnout Revenge. And I still have to play Magic Penjel, or not Magic Penjel, Graffiti Kingdom. I bought that game like a while ago and I had to play it.

1732
02:25:22,080 --> 02:25:25,080
You know, I have your Magic Penjel game.

1733
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:29,080
Sorry, I have my version on the hard drive.

1734
02:25:29,080 --> 02:25:31,080
I gotcha, I gotcha.

1735
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:35,080
Speaking of which, I still have your DER Max 2, I think.

1736
02:25:35,080 --> 02:25:36,080
I want that back.

1737
02:25:36,080 --> 02:25:41,840
I don't know how we ended up with two U.S. copies of it, I mean, cause, but, whatever.

1738
02:25:41,840 --> 02:25:47,480
I've been playing Pump It Up lately, and if you listen to last week's show, I'm kinda liking Pump It Up, believe it or not, on Xbox.

1739
02:25:47,480 --> 02:25:52,980
No, it's really good! Like, I know, I know, even I would've, like, if I were listening to myself, like, three weeks ago, I would've said,

1740
02:25:52,980 --> 02:25:57,600
Rob, you're smoking dope. But no, it's really a fun dance game on the home version.

1741
02:25:57,600 --> 02:25:59,480
I know! Stop looking at me like that!

1742
02:25:59,480 --> 02:25:59,980
Rob?

1743
02:25:59,980 --> 02:26:00,480
What?

1744
02:26:00,480 --> 02:26:00,980
You're smoking dope.

1745
02:26:00,980 --> 02:26:01,480
I know.

1746
02:26:01,480 --> 02:26:04,580
Ain't no one else no one's playing? I'd be in the group.

1747
02:26:04,580 --> 02:26:15,100
I did see In The Groove at Best Buy and it had dust on it.

1748
02:26:15,100 --> 02:26:16,100
You guys are awful.

1749
02:26:16,100 --> 02:26:17,100
I'm going to go pour dust on this.

1750
02:26:17,100 --> 02:26:19,100
I know, I'm being very serious.

1751
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:21,380
You guys are just ruthless.

1752
02:26:21,380 --> 02:26:26,560
I don't care about In The Groove because I'm over it.

1753
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,560
It's done.

1754
02:26:27,560 --> 02:26:28,560
All right.

1755
02:26:28,560 --> 02:26:29,900
They have their In The Groove.

1756
02:26:29,900 --> 02:26:32,820
I heard they cut the price of it though.

1757
02:26:32,820 --> 02:26:33,820
Is that just on DRP's special?

1758
02:26:33,820 --> 02:26:42,820
It's a sale. It's a sale that's going on. It's not DDR4, it's just Red Octane. They clear out their extra copies they aren't selling and, you know, I bought one. So I'm only helping.

1759
02:26:42,820 --> 02:26:54,820
I know, isn't that... If you think about it, even though Loki is saying how much he hates this game and stuff, he just helped them out by buying a copy legitimately just to give away to somebody.

1760
02:26:54,820 --> 02:27:01,820
So you can't, you know, you can't hate him too much in the group of fans because he ended up supporting your game after all. So taunt him relentlessly over that.

1761
02:27:01,820 --> 02:27:02,820
Doesn't matter.

1762
02:27:02,820 --> 02:27:08,420
Alright. Alright kids, it's that time of the show where we're gonna get a little bit angsty

1763
02:27:08,420 --> 02:27:11,500
and it's time to get into the FUs of the Week. So if you have some FUs of the Week, send

1764
02:27:11,500 --> 02:27:15,700
those on over to me. And DarkSakura, why do we have to do these FUs of the Week every

1765
02:27:15,700 --> 02:27:17,700
single week? Grr. Argh.

1766
02:27:17,700 --> 02:27:30,700
Uh. A big FU goes toward the flu or whatever the fuck it was I had. Cause I was miserable

1767
02:27:30,700 --> 02:27:33,540
And now I'm still getting weird fatigue from it too.

1768
02:27:33,540 --> 02:27:41,820
So, an F.U. goes to having a geography exam on Wednesday, but on the same day I have to

1769
02:27:41,820 --> 02:27:46,180
get my ass up at like 4.30 in the morning to get Dan to the airport at 6, so he can

1770
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:51,620
fly off to a big ol' happy GameStop video game manager conference and get free shit.

1771
02:27:51,620 --> 02:27:55,380
Well, I have to go to work that morning, dammit!

1772
02:27:55,380 --> 02:27:58,660
And have to deal with a 30 minute lunch and then an exam afterwards that I really don't

1773
02:27:58,660 --> 02:27:59,660
want to go to.

1774
02:27:59,660 --> 02:28:07,840
very much and an SU goes to being told I was going to be prescribed antibiotics

1775
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:11,980
for the sinus infection part of what I had and then going all the way to the

1776
02:28:11,980 --> 02:28:15,060
pharmacy to find out oh no I'm sorry they didn't prescribe that and then

1777
02:28:15,060 --> 02:28:19,780
telling them to refill my decongestant and having them not do it just refill my

1778
02:28:19,780 --> 02:28:30,660
ibuprofen instead but and another as you goes toward people who like to just try

1779
02:28:30,660 --> 02:28:35,500
to kill me while I'm driving you know I think that they're retards if you to in

1780
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:44,660
the groove because it bites what and if you to for some reason World of

1781
02:28:44,660 --> 02:28:48,220
Warcraft not letting me use my controller and I haven't seen anything on

1782
02:28:48,220 --> 02:28:54,040
how to set up a controller config on it. That is the biggest piece of shit I have ever heard

1783
02:28:54,040 --> 02:29:01,040
my entire life. Um, actually I do the point click mouse thingy, which is like playing

1784
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:11,760
rock and rock. But uh, okay I'm gonna be sending some hate mail to Blizzard, so that's it.

1785
02:29:11,760 --> 02:29:13,760
So, that's it.

1786
02:29:41,760 --> 02:30:06,760
Anyways. The only monkey butler I can think of is Brett Butler. But um, no. So first off, fuck you to stupid old people that can't drive the speed limit. You know the type, the ones that are pulling out of the church parking lot on Sundays. Fucking, they have the glory of God holding the breakdown on their goddamn car. So, fuck you to them, they should burn in hell.

1787
02:30:06,760 --> 02:30:33,760
Um, also, uh, I wanna say fuck you to the Kia Rio dealership, um, or basically, yeah, Folsom Lake Kia, um, over here in, uh, Folsom, California, because they did not have goddamn pretzels in their snack machine, so I had to settle for some cheddar sour cream, um, ruffles, and the fucking machine didn't give me any change back, just like a normal car salesman, so fuck them.

1788
02:30:33,760 --> 02:30:43,760
And, um, let's see what else. Oh, also, um, fuck you to the fact that I only have enough time to play, um, all these games that I'm getting for free.

1789
02:30:43,760 --> 02:30:49,760
Oh, you poor thing! Poor me. Give it to me! I did nothing this week! Nothing!

1790
02:30:49,760 --> 02:30:52,760
You played fucking Final Fantasy XI?

1791
02:30:52,760 --> 02:30:56,760
I fucking wouldn't have if I had something else to play.

1792
02:30:56,760 --> 02:30:58,760
No, I'm just kidding.

1793
02:30:58,760 --> 02:31:01,760
Miklotov guilted me into it. What can I say?

1794
02:31:01,760 --> 02:31:10,760
So, yeah, um, there was something else here, um, ah, whatever, I-I can't remember it, just, you know, mainly fuck you old people for driving slow.

1795
02:31:11,760 --> 02:31:19,760
And those people that don't signal! Fuck them too! I hate those people that need to weave through traffic to get, like, five seconds ahead of everybody else.

1796
02:31:19,760 --> 02:31:25,760
And fuck the people who actually try to change lanes into the spot that you exactly are existing in right now.

1797
02:31:25,760 --> 02:31:29,760
Or the ones that pretend that your car's not there and don't let you in when you're signaling.

1798
02:31:29,760 --> 02:31:31,760
Those are usually the people that I cut off.

1799
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:33,760
That's usually me, actually.

1800
02:31:33,760 --> 02:31:35,760
Alright, I'm done.

1801
02:31:41,760 --> 02:31:47,760
An FU to my washer, because it constantly gets my clothes off balance.

1802
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:50,760
Like, every time I do a load of laundry in there, it starts spinning.

1803
02:31:50,760 --> 02:31:52,760
And it sounds like the psycho washer from hell, because it's going...

1804
02:31:54,760 --> 02:31:58,760
And we live upstairs, mind you, so I know those people that live downstairs are not happy with us.

1805
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:02,240
not happy with us. There's nothing you can do. And an F.U. to myself for forgetting that

1806
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:05,240
I need to go to the washer and take my clothes and put them in the dryer, because they've

1807
02:32:05,240 --> 02:32:10,280
been sitting in the washer for about, oh, three hours now. So, way to go, Rob. Smart,

1808
02:32:10,280 --> 02:32:16,920
smart thing. And now, nice and mildewy fresh will my clothes be. That's it. I'm short on

1809
02:32:16,920 --> 02:32:21,880
F.U.s tonight. That's it. So let's get to our guests tonight, starting off with Bugd

1810
02:32:21,880 --> 02:32:23,280
and his F.U.s of the week.

1811
02:32:23,280 --> 02:32:27,760
Bugd F.U. to Hooters, actually. Not for the boobs and cleavage, but for using MSG on

1812
02:32:27,760 --> 02:32:32,640
their wings gave me a migraine they use MSG on their wings yeah well between my

1813
02:32:32,640 --> 02:32:38,760
brother and his two friends and I we went through 50 wings oh my god but my

1814
02:32:38,760 --> 02:32:44,480
brother's my size and so were his friends so yeah that was that was the

1815
02:32:44,480 --> 02:32:47,960
beginning of my week Monday was go to Hooters have wings have migraine for

1816
02:32:47,960 --> 02:32:51,560
next two days have you to line at Hooters being way too long walk right in

1817
02:32:51,560 --> 02:32:56,360
When? Monday. Monday night? No, Monday afternoon.

1818
02:32:56,360 --> 02:32:59,700
3-4. See, that's why. I'm going to try going down. That's you to working, huh?

1819
02:32:59,700 --> 02:33:04,380
Hooters is kind of icky anyway. Hooters is a little bit overrated, but there's something

1820
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:08,100
I can't explain that. I know what some of you guys that have been listening to this show for a

1821
02:33:08,100 --> 02:33:10,980
while are thinking, Rob, you're gay. What's the deal with Hooters?

1822
02:33:10,980 --> 02:33:15,740
I can't explain it. It's the same reason I go to strip clubs. Boobies are hilarious.

1823
02:33:15,740 --> 02:33:19,740
We fought through a crowd to get to Hooters.

1824
02:33:19,740 --> 02:33:23,780
We did a concert. We did when we were at E3 in LA

1825
02:33:23,780 --> 02:33:28,340
randomly that Thursday or Friday night, I think it was the Thursday night of E3, we were on

1826
02:33:28,340 --> 02:33:30,060
Hollywood Boulevard, our hotel, right?

1827
02:33:30,060 --> 02:33:34,580
Audioslave? Audioslave was having a free concert in the middle of the fucking street.

1828
02:33:34,580 --> 02:33:37,980
We had to cut through a crowd to get to Hooters,

1829
02:33:37,980 --> 02:33:42,660
which was empty, of course, because of the, um, because of the, uh,

1830
02:33:42,660 --> 02:33:46,940
concert that was going. In hindsight, we probably could have just gone around the block, but, you know.

1831
02:33:46,940 --> 02:33:51,340
My whole thing about Hooters is the same thing about fucking Krispy Kreme.

1832
02:33:51,340 --> 02:33:55,340
I grew up with this stuff. It's not special.

1833
02:33:55,340 --> 02:33:59,940
But it's new. It's not special and it's not new.

1834
02:33:59,940 --> 02:34:03,180
To those of you guys in the rest of America, understand

1835
02:34:03,180 --> 02:34:06,660
Sacramento is, and I seriously think I read this somewhere, Sacramento is the

1836
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:09,820
only major city in the nation that has not had a Hooters until this year.

1837
02:34:09,820 --> 02:34:13,140
The real reason to rejoice is if we get Waffle House.

1838
02:34:13,140 --> 02:34:15,860
I would also like more Shoney's

1839
02:34:15,860 --> 02:34:19,300
Shoney's, Waffle House,

1840
02:34:19,300 --> 02:34:22,460
we need Shoney's, Waffle House, and

1841
02:34:22,460 --> 02:34:25,900
Cracker Barrel.

1842
02:34:25,900 --> 02:34:30,300
Oh please, please. Cracker Barrel's a little bit overrated to me.

1843
02:34:30,300 --> 02:34:34,580
There's three places that I just named off or not within driving distance unless I feel like taking three days to get there.

1844
02:34:34,580 --> 02:34:38,380
I don't know. Cracker Barrel's in Salt Lake City. That's only 12 hours.

1845
02:34:38,380 --> 02:34:45,380
You East Coast people can keep your Hardee's, because Carl's Jr. is way better than Hardee's.

1846
02:34:45,380 --> 02:34:47,380
It's the same fucking restaurant!

1847
02:34:47,380 --> 02:34:48,380
No, it's way better here.

1848
02:34:48,380 --> 02:34:49,380
They're owned by the same people!

1849
02:34:49,380 --> 02:34:50,380
And you don't have Jack in the Box.

1850
02:34:50,380 --> 02:34:53,380
But you can't get fried chicken or biscuits and gravy at Carl's Jr.

1851
02:34:53,380 --> 02:34:57,380
Alright, let's let Bug finish.

1852
02:34:57,380 --> 02:34:59,380
An F.U. to Apple for the iPod Nano.

1853
02:34:59,380 --> 02:35:04,380
It's so damn sexy and looks so nice and it's really damn small

1854
02:35:04,380 --> 02:35:14,380
and it doesn't support my most useful item I have for my 20 gig, which is the wireless remote where I don't have to actually look at the machine, or the iPod.

1855
02:35:14,380 --> 02:35:21,380
It's kind of crummy. It looks nice, and the headphone port's on the bottom. It's really strange looking.

1856
02:35:21,380 --> 02:35:24,380
Alright, Magus.

1857
02:35:24,380 --> 02:35:30,380
Alright, you know I've had these saved up for a long time. Make it quick, it's a three hour show.

1858
02:35:30,380 --> 02:35:32,380
Who'd guess?

1859
02:35:32,380 --> 02:35:34,780
No pooling in explicit, thank you.

1860
02:36:02,380 --> 02:36:07,380
Do not give them our number. We don't help with that shit.

1861
02:36:07,380 --> 02:36:12,380
Nobody on the internet knows what you're talking about right now, but that's okay. That's what this is all about.

1862
02:36:12,380 --> 02:36:24,380
Second of all, fuck you to these PvP server rejects that think they're gonna roll on the new World of Warcraft PvP roleplay servers.

1863
02:36:24,380 --> 02:36:33,380
which are basically roleplay naming policies and in-character stuff with player-versus-player contested area rules.

1864
02:36:33,380 --> 02:36:37,380
Now, you have these people harassing roleplayers left and right and then saying,

1865
02:36:37,380 --> 02:36:40,380
we're exploiting the rules against them.

1866
02:36:40,380 --> 02:36:44,380
Hello, if you didn't break the rules, you wouldn't get busted for them.

1867
02:36:44,380 --> 02:36:49,380
Likewise to forums. If you don't break the rules, you don't get banned for them.

1868
02:36:49,380 --> 02:36:51,380
Are you a mod on GameFAQs yet?

1869
02:37:19,380 --> 02:37:21,380
out

1870
02:37:21,860 --> 02:37:24,980
Angel no if use angel. I'm gonna give an angel on behalf

1871
02:37:24,980 --> 02:37:28,340
I'm gonna get you know I'm gonna give an f you on behalf of angel f you to

1872
02:37:28,660 --> 02:37:33,700
All that walking around angel did at the convention cuz she's sore and you can tell she's tired as hell all right

1873
02:37:33,700 --> 02:37:36,660
I'll relay one for f you to hotel beds and

1874
02:37:37,300 --> 02:37:43,220
Getting lost in the middle of hotels that do it for you. Okay. Okay. That was a personal f you all right

1875
02:37:43,220 --> 02:37:45,220
Let's get to the chat room at fuse

1876
02:37:45,220 --> 02:37:51,220
F you to my DS for not having a sound system. It's simply gone.

1877
02:37:51,220 --> 02:38:06,220
F you to me fucking up my knee and not having a clue as to how the hell I did it and having to limp around during work.

1878
02:38:06,220 --> 02:38:12,220
F you to having to work today period because the Arnold days parade being the same day as my mom's union picnic.

1879
02:38:12,220 --> 02:38:19,220
I would give you one for the parade itself, but I got a minimum of an hour of being stuck in drive-thru without actually having to take drive-thru orders.

1880
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:27,220
Zaku says, F you to State University Police for thinking I, a Hispanic, took their barricade to my place when my roommate actually took it.

1881
02:38:27,220 --> 02:38:32,220
That's like one time I got busted in college for smoking pot, and it was my roommate, and the bastard left.

1882
02:38:32,220 --> 02:38:39,220
He left, and like not even five seconds later, I walk in and I smell pot, and then my door is open and my RA walks by and he smells pot.

1883
02:38:39,220 --> 02:38:42,220
I'm like, do I look like... oh, I was so mad.

1884
02:38:42,220 --> 02:38:46,220
When my roommate was so obviously a pothead. He was such a pothead!

1885
02:38:46,220 --> 02:38:47,220
Amen!

1886
02:38:47,220 --> 02:38:53,220
That's how he laughed. He had that total stone laugh.

1887
02:38:53,220 --> 02:38:56,220
We just had the bottles of booze hidden in my closet.

1888
02:38:56,220 --> 02:38:59,220
Anyway, Zaku also says F you to Tokyo Game Action.

1889
02:38:59,220 --> 02:39:01,220
We're going to Great Links to get Happy Sky.

1890
02:39:01,220 --> 02:39:05,220
Konami is going to blacklist the person who gave it to you, so enjoy it while it lasts.

1891
02:39:05,220 --> 02:39:08,220
F you to snitches in general for their snitching ways of ruining all the fun.

1892
02:39:08,220 --> 02:39:15,220

1896
02:39:35,060 --> 02:39:42,060
A random person walking by just started puking on everything, including the people nearby.

1897
02:39:42,900 --> 02:39:47,860
And FU to the fucker on Digg who called Rob Jamie Takash, I don't know what Takash is,

1901
02:39:57,260 --> 02:40:00,340
What? Did they do an MMO Oregon Trail thing on G4?

1902
02:40:00,340 --> 02:40:00,940
What?

1903
02:40:00,940 --> 02:40:03,700

02:40:15,540 --> 02:40:20,080
MPQ says F you to myself for already wanting a bigger monitor when this one is brand new F

All right, FU to Ikaruga for being too fucking hard,

1930
02:41:43,740 --> 02:41:46,060
having that huge-ass fish on the third stage.

1931
02:41:46,060 --> 02:41:50,420
And that guy who beat it on hard without dying.

1932
02:41:50,420 --> 02:41:51,900
Just turn your screen sideways.

at techno.

1938
02:42:06,740 --> 02:42:10,380
Go back to listen to your stupid punk-pop rock and mediocre hip-hop bullshit.

1939
02:42:12,380 --> 02:42:13,980
I have, I have, um...

1940
02:42:13,980 --> 02:42:14,740
Hold on!

1941
02:42:14,740 --> 02:42:15,940
Rene? What? What?

1942
02:42:15,940 --> 02:42:18,140
I have the update on the, uh, Oregon Trail thing.

1943
02:42:18,140 --> 02:42:20,460
All right, wait. After the po- After this. After this.

1944
02:42:20,460 --> 02:42:21,140
Rene says,

1945
02:42:21,140 --> 02:42:24,140
F you to bad posture because my entire lower arm is hurting,

1946
02:42:24,140 --> 02:42:25,780
and one for my iPod because

1947
02:42:25,780 --> 02:42:29,540
O-L-R interrupt my good streaks of songs when the thing's on shuffle songs.

1948
02:42:31,900 --> 02:42:34,300
Sorry to ruin your day.

1949
02:42:34,300 --> 02:42:39,000
Zaku says F you to the Nintendo Revolution controller for being a fake-ass anti-fighter game phaser.

1950
02:42:39,000 --> 02:42:42,700
Nintendo should set their revolution phaser on stun and sodomize themselves with it.

1951
02:42:44,700 --> 02:42:46,300
Only on the internet.

1952
02:42:46,300 --> 02:42:50,000
SSJ100Matt says F you to the Yankees not in the playoffs.

1953
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,500
Yeah, let's go Yankees.

1954
02:42:53,300 --> 02:42:55,300
Alright, that's it, that's it.

1955
02:42:55,300 --> 02:42:57,700
Alright, what's the fault? I wanna know, what the hell?

1956
02:42:57,700 --> 02:43:00,700
Did G4 yank our idea? What the fuck?

1957
02:43:00,700 --> 02:43:02,100
No, it's kind of retarded.

1958
02:43:02,100 --> 02:43:03,100
Oh, okay.

1959
02:43:03,100 --> 02:43:27,100
What it is, is the show host, they're playing, it's almost like, you know, like playing an actual role-playing game, they're on, basically the users are giving them what they're supposed to do, like for example, they had just tried to cross a river, and cocked their wagon, and it tipped over, and now Sarah's dead, so it's, one of the hosts is dead now, um, it's just, it doesn't even sound like they're trying to do it.

1960
02:43:27,100 --> 02:43:28,100
Okay, so it's not an MMO?

1961
02:43:28,100 --> 02:43:31,100
No, it's not an actual game, it's just something fun they're doing on forums.

1962
02:43:31,100 --> 02:43:32,380
putting the phone down then.

1963
02:43:32,380 --> 02:43:34,460
We don't have to call the lawyers.

1964
02:43:34,460 --> 02:43:35,980
Put the phone down.

1965
02:43:35,980 --> 02:43:37,940
But I was a little irritated there for a minute.

1966
02:43:37,940 --> 02:43:41,420
I thought my rights was feeling violated there a little bit.

1967
02:43:41,420 --> 02:43:43,420
Because day one, what they do, it

1968
02:43:43,420 --> 02:43:48,580
says we started on an on-set game of the classic role

1969
02:43:48,580 --> 02:43:49,900
playing game, Oregon Trail.

1970
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:52,020
And we want you to play along with us.

1971
02:43:52,020 --> 02:43:56,340
And it says, so basically what they've done

1972
02:43:56,340 --> 02:43:58,180
is they're just actually doing it.

1973
02:43:58,180 --> 02:44:02,680
playing the actual game in studio or whatever when naming all the people as

1974
02:44:02,680 --> 02:44:07,660
the hosts names and so then they're basically having the users tell them

1975
02:44:07,660 --> 02:44:13,360
what to do next okay that's all it is we could do that too if we wanted to but

1976
02:44:13,360 --> 02:44:17,320
we've got better things to do with our time exactly when I play Oregon Trail I

1977
02:44:17,320 --> 02:44:20,240
want my own private game I don't want you people tell me what to do with it we

1978
02:44:20,240 --> 02:44:27,360
need to mod Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to play Oregon Trail on all right kids

1979
02:44:27,360 --> 02:44:33,360
You guys have been asking for it, it's been like a month since we've been able to do this.

1980
02:44:33,360 --> 02:44:36,360
We are going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

1981
02:44:36,360 --> 02:44:41,360
Send a private message to Sky with any question you want to ask us and we'll get to those questions as soon as this break is over.

1982
02:44:41,360 --> 02:44:45,580
We're going to start it off with a little bit of Taku in this break with Electro-Tuned.

1983
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:46,580
Enjoy.

1984
02:44:46,580 --> 02:45:08,820
Video

1985
02:45:08,820 --> 02:45:10,820
Can we grow the beauty of my head?

1986
02:46:10,820 --> 02:46:35,260
Oh, do you want a funky music?

1987
02:46:35,260 --> 02:46:37,260
Everybody funky music.

1988
02:46:37,260 --> 02:46:39,260
Tonight is the night.

1989
02:46:39,260 --> 02:46:41,260
Monkey music is the night.

1990
02:46:41,260 --> 02:46:44,260
Oh do you wanna monkey music?

1991
02:46:44,260 --> 02:46:46,260
Everybody from King Mill City

1992
02:47:44,260 --> 02:48:13,500
And now, let's listen in to an

1993
02:48:13,500 --> 02:48:19,140
Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming

1994
02:48:19,140 --> 02:48:20,900
to Orange Lounge Radio.

1995
02:48:20,900 --> 02:48:25,460
Um, Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bamani Music and More

1996
02:48:25,460 --> 02:48:26,860
program. Can we talk about that?

1997
02:48:26,860 --> 02:48:29,020
No subject will ever be taboo.

1998
02:48:29,020 --> 02:48:33,660
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move, pump up the volume from Tuesday nights?

1999
02:48:33,660 --> 02:48:36,700
Except of course the subject that was just under discussion.

2000
02:48:36,700 --> 02:48:41,340
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play

2001
02:48:41,340 --> 02:48:42,420
on the station?

2002
02:48:42,420 --> 02:48:47,340
I collect your fucking head, just like this fucker here.

2003
02:48:49,340 --> 02:48:50,340
Oh my God.

2004
02:48:50,340 --> 02:48:52,180
Why did you do that to Loki?

2005
02:48:52,300 --> 02:48:55,900
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke.

2006
02:48:56,580 --> 02:49:03,420
Now, if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

2007
02:49:04,140 --> 02:49:08,180
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

2008
02:49:08,180 --> 02:49:15,180
And that break, electro-tuned, and from Puppet Up, Funky Tonight, let's get into Ask Orange

2009
02:49:15,180 --> 02:49:20,060
Lounge.

2010
02:49:20,060 --> 02:49:23,460
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question.

2011
02:49:23,460 --> 02:49:27,180
What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

2012
02:49:27,180 --> 02:49:32,020
It's been a little while since we've done this segment with new listeners.

2013
02:49:32,020 --> 02:49:37,980
Tonight should be a barrel of monkeys fun.

2014
02:49:37,980 --> 02:49:40,620

it's very great it is a large hole it's it's

2023
02:50:06,040 --> 02:50:09,820
The reason why it sucks is because nobody lives there, so there's not a lot to do unless

2024
02:50:09,820 --> 02:50:10,820
you like snow.

2025
02:50:10,820 --> 02:50:11,820
You know what?

2026
02:50:11,820 --> 02:50:12,820
But it's very pretty.

What?

2029
02:50:14,820 --> 02:50:15,820
My mother-in-law was born in Wyoming.

2030
02:50:15,820 --> 02:50:20,300
I've been across Wyoming three times, and I stopped like four times.

2031
02:50:20,300 --> 02:50:26,340
And most of the stops are at Little America, yay, 35 cent ice cream.

2032
02:50:26,340 --> 02:50:32,420
Dark Tetsuya, what license Konami original DDR song would you girls and guys most like

02:50:32,420 --> 02:50:36,420
I would like to see an Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3.

2034
02:50:36,420 --> 02:50:42,420
Anybody want to kick us off? What licensed song do you really want to see in Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3?

2035
02:50:42,420 --> 02:50:46,420
I would like New Echo Image. K, thanks. Never Ending Story. K, thanks.

2036
02:50:46,420 --> 02:50:50,420
Dark Sakura? Loki? Anything?

2037
02:50:50,420 --> 02:50:52,420
Get Loki a mic.

2038
02:50:52,420 --> 02:50:54,420
Damn sure you need a mic.

2039
02:50:54,420 --> 02:51:01,500
I would have to say I think I think we need some ultimate cheeseburger in there

2040
02:51:03,060 --> 02:51:05,060
The ultimate cheeseburger song

2041
02:51:06,620 --> 02:51:10,260
Debbie Gibson's electric blue, but does she mean electric youth

2042
02:51:11,180 --> 02:51:15,300
Electric you head into the blessing of into the blue. Yeah, I got one what?

2043
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:22,300
Might not might not have heard though expansion union playing with playing with lightning. You may have heard on the movie blade

2044
02:51:22,300 --> 02:51:35,740
Legend of Zaku wants to know, how come girls love the smell of Axe body spray?

2045
02:51:35,740 --> 02:51:42,620
And as a gay male, I can tell you it's not only the girls.

2046
02:51:42,620 --> 02:51:49,300
Being a Hispanic, do you have any good pickup lines for picking up white chicks?

2047
02:51:49,300 --> 02:51:52,020
Dark Soccer, I'll defer that question to you.

2048
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:54,700
Have any good lines for picking up white chicks?

2049
02:51:54,700 --> 02:52:00,100
Who's Hispanic here?

2050
02:52:00,100 --> 02:52:01,660
Legend of Zaku is a Hispanic.

2051
02:52:01,660 --> 02:52:02,820
Who's one of us?

2052
02:52:02,820 --> 02:52:06,100
You're a white chick, so you should know what pick up lines will work on you.

2053
02:52:06,100 --> 02:52:07,100
I'm married!

2054
02:52:07,100 --> 02:52:11,300
Well, but, imagine it's, you know, five years ago before, how long have you known Dan?

2055
02:52:11,300 --> 02:52:12,300
Five years?

2056
02:52:12,300 --> 02:52:13,300
Six years?

2057
02:52:13,300 --> 02:52:14,300
Imagine it's seven years ago.

2058
02:52:14,300 --> 02:52:15,300
I've known Dan for ten years.

2059
02:52:15,300 --> 02:52:18,940
Okay, then eleven years ago, what was a pick up line that would have worked on you?

2060
02:52:18,940 --> 02:52:23,140
years ago I was like in high school okay I'll tell you that here it is here it is

2061
02:52:23,140 --> 02:52:32,620
hey baby I like peanut butter you want to fuck there it is no it's called be

2062
02:52:32,620 --> 02:52:39,240
genuine don't be an asshole and don't go hey chica because yeah that actually has

2063
02:52:39,240 --> 02:52:45,980
been tried on me before I shot that down all right um and don't date girls in

2064
02:52:45,980 --> 02:52:50,980
I have used that before. It rotates for the Chat Room FUs, the song every week.

2065
02:52:50,980 --> 02:52:55,980
Will the Orange Launch Radio crew sign a copy of In the Groove if I send one to them?

2066
02:52:55,980 --> 02:53:00,980
Sure, but that doesn't mean we'll send it back.

2067
02:53:00,980 --> 02:53:05,980
No, we will. Will we sign it?

2068
02:53:05,980 --> 02:53:10,980
Yeah, I guess.

2069
02:53:10,980 --> 02:53:14,980
Yeah, we will, but we don't take responsibility for what we write on it.

2070
02:53:15,980 --> 02:53:17,980
But what will you sign it with?

2071
02:53:18,980 --> 02:53:19,980
My dick!

2072
02:53:20,980 --> 02:53:23,980
Yes, I'll rub my fat cock against it.

2073
02:53:26,980 --> 02:53:29,980
Two fat cocks? Rubbing together? Oil?

2074
02:53:30,980 --> 02:53:32,980
Forget it. Bad Orange Tons Radio Inside joke.

2075
02:53:32,980 --> 02:53:40,980
And a special question for Loki, what do you think of the subliminal anal sex if you wear polarized lenses while playing Graffiti Kingdom?

2076
02:53:42,980 --> 02:53:44,980
What?

2077
02:53:45,980 --> 02:53:51,980
Granted, there would be some characters we might draw that look like, you know, anal sex, but um...

2078
02:53:52,980 --> 02:53:54,980
What?

2079
02:53:54,980 --> 02:54:00,980
Acer800 wants to know, what's monkeys fun?

2080
02:54:00,980 --> 02:54:05,180
Oh, and what's the square root of 443,556?

2081
02:54:05,180 --> 02:54:08,980
Uh, get a calculator. Seriously,

2082
02:54:08,980 --> 02:54:12,300
just get a calculator. In fact, actually I think I have one on my desktop here,

2083
02:54:12,300 --> 02:54:16,460
if I can fire up the calculator program here, and I will

2084
02:54:16,460 --> 02:54:20,980
switch that over to the scientific mode because scientific mode will allow me to

2085
02:54:20,980 --> 02:54:22,580
do square roots here. It has more buttons.

2086
02:54:22,580 --> 02:54:25,420
It has more buttons, that means it must work better, right?

2087
02:54:25,420 --> 02:54:28,500
So 443, 556, where's the square root button?

2088
02:54:28,500 --> 02:54:29,980
I know it's on here somewhere, right?

2089
02:54:29,980 --> 02:54:30,780
Oh, shit.

2090
02:54:30,780 --> 02:54:31,740
666.

2091
02:54:31,740 --> 02:54:32,700
Shit.

2092
02:54:32,700 --> 02:54:35,060
Is it 666, really?

2093
02:54:35,060 --> 02:54:37,100
Damn you, bugs, damn you.

2094
02:54:37,100 --> 02:54:41,140
Haha, 666, double joke.

2095
02:54:41,140 --> 02:54:45,740
MPQ, is there any point in playing 2DX one-handed?

2096
02:54:45,740 --> 02:54:47,300
So you can master it with the other.

2097
02:54:47,300 --> 02:54:55,640
dark night wants to know okay cast what do you think was the best orange lounge

2098
02:54:55,640 --> 02:55:03,160
radio bad joke of all time let me rephrase that worst I would say the

2099
02:55:03,160 --> 02:55:08,200
bleached asshole thing went way too far I could say something really mean but we

2100
02:55:08,200 --> 02:55:12,320
banned that a long time ago God okay yeah yeah I know what you're talking

2101
02:55:12,320 --> 02:55:18,320
Let's just say that the biggest joke could be transposed into a lizard.

2102
02:55:23,320 --> 02:55:27,320
I am the worst joke ever to hit Orange Land Radio.

2103
02:55:27,320 --> 02:55:28,320
Oh no, there's worse.

2104
02:55:28,320 --> 02:55:35,320
SSJ100 Matt wants to know, besides Kid Icarus, what characters would you like to see in the next Super Smash Brothers?

2105
02:55:37,320 --> 02:55:38,320
That's a tough one.

2106
02:55:38,320 --> 02:55:44,320
Oh, well actually it was Pit. He wasn't Kid Icarus, he was Pit. So I want to see Pit.

2107
02:55:44,320 --> 02:55:47,320
I would like to see the Eggplant Wizard, actually.

2108
02:55:47,320 --> 02:55:48,320
Eggplant Wizard, yeah!

2109
02:55:48,320 --> 02:55:58,320
But, okay, but I guess if I have to go outside the realm of Kid Icarus, I would like to see the guy from the wizard with the power glove.

2110
02:55:58,320 --> 02:56:19,320
I want to see Samus versus the Guardian. Even though it wasn't purely Nintendo, because it was first on MSX, wouldn't that just be an awesome fight? Because I think it would be a pretty dead even match. Except that I think the Guardian actually gets more weapons.

2111
02:56:19,320 --> 02:56:29,320
I would like to see Nestor, Howard in Nestor, I would like to see on the next Super Smash Bros. a Nintendog get in there.

2112
02:56:29,320 --> 02:56:30,320
Yeah!

2113
02:56:30,320 --> 02:56:31,320
Get a puppy in there.

2114
02:56:31,320 --> 02:56:33,320
Puppy battle! And he poops on you.

2115
02:56:33,320 --> 02:56:43,320
Alright, I know, seriously I know we have probably enough Fire Emblem characters in current Smash Bros. Melee, but I would like to see Hector in there.

2116
02:56:43,320 --> 02:56:44,320
Yeah.

2117
02:56:44,320 --> 02:56:48,320
I would like to see at least someone representing an axe.

2118
02:56:48,320 --> 02:56:54,560
Okay. All right. All right. I think we've given you a lot of good ideas there. Anyway.

2119
02:56:54,560 --> 02:56:59,200
Moving on. Sefie would like to know, and this is the perennial question that comes up once

2120
02:56:59,200 --> 02:57:02,960
every 50 shows or so, so there's no problem. We can't answer this again. Where did you

2121
02:57:02,960 --> 02:57:10,080
guys come up with the name Orange Lounge? So we get this question quite a bit. No biggie.

2122
02:57:10,080 --> 02:57:11,080
My fault.

2123
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:16,740
Well, no, wait. We both came up with this when we were on the train there. We knew we

2124
02:57:16,740 --> 02:57:21,040
wanted to do a radio station that had to do with DDR and Bimani games was kind of

2125
02:57:21,040 --> 02:57:26,040
the root. We started with our love of music-based video games. The podcast was

2126
02:57:26,040 --> 02:57:29,820
separate because we knew we wanted to grow eventually outside the mold of

2127
02:57:29,820 --> 02:57:33,480
music-based games and talk about other video games because we're gamers first

2128
02:57:33,480 --> 02:57:37,080
and music game fans second, but we knew when we first started this whole thing

2129
02:57:37,080 --> 02:57:40,860
in 2001 we wanted to do something dedicated to specifically the music

2130
02:57:40,860 --> 02:57:45,240
video games and Orange Lounge is a band that does some of the music for these

2131
02:57:45,240 --> 02:57:54,840
games. That's Orange Lounge right there. And Orange Lounge just sounded like a good radio

2132
02:57:54,840 --> 02:57:59,720
show name, because like a lounge, like we're lounging around and talking about games. Because

2133
02:57:59,720 --> 02:58:03,280
the feel of the show is very much the feel, I think, that we're trying to emulate from

2134
02:58:03,280 --> 02:58:07,400
the show I used to be a part of, which is Under Sedation Live, where it was just a bunch

2135
02:58:07,400 --> 02:58:10,280
of us and it sounded like we were sitting around at Denny's talking about nothing.

2136
02:58:10,280 --> 02:58:15,120
I visited there a lot. I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Guanagirl once.

2137
02:58:15,120 --> 02:58:17,920
Dark Soccer was a frequent guest over on our station live. So we're just trying to create

2138
02:58:17,920 --> 02:58:26,240
that Denny's talking about whatever vibe. So that's us, Orange Lounge. We gotta hurry

2139
02:58:26,240 --> 02:58:32,360
up here. We got a bunch of questions still. Lots of questions here. I'm going to ask just

2140
02:58:32,360 --> 02:58:38,640
one of them from NM64. What's gonna be the first game you'll download for the Nintendo

2141
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:42,640
One NES, SNES, and Nintendo 64.

2142
02:58:42,640 --> 02:58:46,640
If it could be any. Any.

2143
02:58:46,640 --> 02:58:50,640
Actually, Nintendo's catalog. Let's say Nintendo's catalog. Fuck, no Guardian Legend.

2144
02:58:50,640 --> 02:58:54,640
Cause that would really be it.

2145
02:58:54,640 --> 02:58:58,640
Um, Nintendo. I'll start.

2146
02:58:58,640 --> 02:59:02,640
I know mine. Kid Icarus, duh. Super Mario Kart, or

2147
02:59:02,640 --> 02:59:06,640
Super Metroid. It's a tough call. One of the two.

2148
02:59:06,640 --> 02:59:08,640
64, Mario 64.

2149
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:11,640
Okay, mine would be, um...

2150
02:59:11,640 --> 02:59:16,640
No, Pokemon Snap.

2151
02:59:16,640 --> 02:59:20,640
I would probably have to say Kid Icarus.

2152
02:59:20,640 --> 02:59:24,640
And then either Star Fox or, um,

2153
02:59:24,640 --> 02:59:28,640
or Zelda A Link to the Past, probably Zelda.

2154
02:59:28,640 --> 02:59:32,640
Um, and then 64, it would be, um, Ocarina.

2155
02:59:32,640 --> 02:59:33,640
Okay.

2156
02:59:33,640 --> 02:59:34,640
Logie?

2157
02:59:34,640 --> 02:59:43,880
Um, I would have to say, I guess, Super Mario Brothers, I guess, and then, um, I would have

2158
02:59:43,880 --> 02:59:53,480
to do, um, oh, Legend of Zelda, Link the Past, and then, um, Star Fox 64.

2159
02:59:53,480 --> 02:59:55,480
Ooh, good call.

2160
02:59:55,480 --> 02:59:57,480
That was fun.

2161
02:59:57,480 --> 03:00:00,600
Because Mario 64, I'm tired of it after the DS.

2162
03:00:00,600 --> 03:00:03,360
She definitely never got Robotech Crystal Dreams.

2163
03:00:03,360 --> 03:00:04,360
We gotta hurry, gotta hurry.

2164
03:00:04,360 --> 03:00:05,360
More questions here.

2165
03:00:05,360 --> 03:00:06,360
We gotta get through.

2166
03:00:06,360 --> 03:00:07,360
We're running over.

2167
03:00:07,360 --> 03:00:08,720
Renee would like to know, I've got a BeatMania noob question.

2168
03:00:08,720 --> 03:00:13,760
I'm anticipating the US version and then wondering how far the game makes you go to make the

2169
03:00:13,760 --> 03:00:14,760
music.

2170
03:00:14,760 --> 03:00:19,860
Are we gonna have to key in every aspect of the song that's being played?

2171
03:00:19,860 --> 03:00:22,680
On the anothers, pretty much yes.

2172
03:00:22,680 --> 03:00:26,320
But on the easy ones and when you get into beginner modes, like hitting one button will

2173
03:00:26,320 --> 03:00:31,260
will do the whole range, whereas in seven-key mode,

2174
03:00:31,260 --> 03:00:34,860
you would actually have to hit do, do, do, do, do.

2175
03:00:34,860 --> 03:00:37,820
It dumbs down the key notes, obviously,

2176
03:00:37,820 --> 03:00:39,420
when you go into easy mode.

2177
03:00:39,420 --> 03:00:41,220
And in fact, a lot of times in easy mode,

2178
03:00:41,220 --> 03:00:43,220
if you just watch what happens.

2179
03:00:43,220 --> 03:00:45,860
Go into easy mode and just start the song

2180
03:00:45,860 --> 03:00:47,460
and don't press anything at all.

2181
03:00:47,460 --> 03:00:49,660
You'll actually hear that quite a bit of the backbeat

2182
03:00:49,660 --> 03:00:50,540
is already presented.

2183
03:00:50,540 --> 03:00:53,440
And you're usually just playing along to a melody or something.

2184
03:00:53,440 --> 03:00:57,240
usually seven keys just kind of adds in a backbeat or light seven I don't know

2185
03:00:57,240 --> 03:01:00,260
if they get progressively harder it's not till the another's where you're

2186
03:01:00,260 --> 03:01:04,760
pretty much really having to play every beat so don't get scared off it

2187
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:08,720
especially I you know the American one is gonna have a very accessible beginner

2188
03:01:08,720 --> 03:01:12,740
mode light seven seven key another progression assuming that another's make

2189
03:01:12,740 --> 03:01:15,480
it to America but I don't see why they wouldn't it would be really stupid

2190
03:01:15,480 --> 03:01:19,200

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2236
03:03:46,720 --> 03:03:49,920
The devil went to Jamaica, he was looking to sell some weed.

2237
03:03:49,920 --> 03:03:53,840
He was doing fine, they were standing in line, it was excellent weed indeed.

2238
03:03:53,840 --> 03:03:57,360
Johnny came across this young man who was likewise peddling pot

2239
03:03:57,360 --> 03:04:01,200
And the devil slid down the beach to the kid and said, boy lemme tell ya what

2240
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:04,520
I guess you kinda figured I'm a reefer head of course

2241
03:04:04,520 --> 03:04:08,240
And after all this time I guess that I'm a connoisseur of sorts

2242
03:04:08,240 --> 03:04:11,640
Now your stuff smells okay but this could tranquilize a horse

2243
03:04:11,640 --> 03:04:15,120
I'll bet a million in cash against your stash cause I think mine's better than yours

2244
03:04:15,120 --> 03:04:19,160
The boy said, my name's Johnny and you ain't smoked nothing yet

2245
03:04:19,160 --> 03:04:22,120
One hit of this grass will kick your ass, you got yourself a bet

2246
03:04:22,120 --> 03:04:26,120
Johnny, roll a ball of hash and make sure it's the bomb

2247
03:04:26,120 --> 03:04:29,120
Cause the devil's got the kind of stuff they smoked in Vietnam

2248
03:04:29,120 --> 03:04:33,120
You'll get a million smackaroos in cash if you can cope

2249
03:04:33,120 --> 03:04:37,120
But if you can't, the devil gets your dope

2250
03:04:44,120 --> 03:04:47,120
The devil packed a bong with a little Acapulco gold

2251
03:04:47,120 --> 03:04:51,120
And resin flew from his fingertips as he fired up his bowl

2252
03:04:51,120 --> 03:04:54,460
He filled that chamber all the way and he took a mighty hit

2253
03:04:54,760 --> 03:04:58,000
As they passed it back and forth gave him both a coffin

2254
03:05:12,680 --> 03:05:16,260
When the bowl was finished Johnny said hey man that stuff was great

2255
03:05:16,320 --> 03:05:19,760
But fill your lungs with some of this and prepare to vegetate

2256
03:05:19,760 --> 03:05:27,840
cannabis the tea of a sweet mary jane the devil's in the backyard crying his brain

2257
03:05:27,840 --> 03:05:38,320
zigzag filled with the diggity dank hold on tight it'll hit you like a tank

2258
03:05:38,320 --> 03:05:41,720
the devil nodded off because he knew that he was stoned

2259
03:05:41,720 --> 03:05:45,280
and he asked if he could buy an ounce of the stuff that johnny owned

2260
03:05:45,280 --> 03:05:48,700
johnny said devil just come on back if you ever want to catch a buzz

2261
03:05:48,700 --> 03:05:52,380

And they fired up doobies one by one, ain't gonna stop till the bag is done.

2263
03:06:00,140 --> 03:06:14,380
