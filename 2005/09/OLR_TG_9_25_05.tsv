289	3150	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 26th, 2005.
3330	13832	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14092	18273	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19173	27795	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another week of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for gaming news, gamer chat...
28649	29049	DarkSakura
53064	53906	Yo, what up?
54046	54567	How you doing?
55448	57151	I am doing remarkably well tonight.
57311	57972	Good, good to hear.
58333	59114	Loki, how you doing?
59414	60656	Our Tech Master Loki's here too.
60957	61398	I'm good.
62082	62322	Good.
62562	62863	All right.
63343	64384	Well, let's get started.
64564	67946	We're going to do... Actually, no, I do have one announcement because this is major.
67966	68647	I have two announcements.
69087	70028	I keep thinking of new announcements.
70568	74531	One, definitely check out our website, OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
74971	78774	On the website, Sacramento Independent Audio for Katrina Relief.
79074	80175	That drive is still going.
80235	80735	Check it out.
80775	86799	It's us, Dark Records, and Club 21, some businesses in Sacramento where this show is based.
87080	91623	But we're doing a worldwide effort because our podcast reaches worldwide to help raise...
92404	99335	Awareness, really, and funds and donations for not only the human survivors of Hurricane Katrina, but animals as well.
99816	101378	Definitely a very important...
102679	103039	DarkSakura
131468	139031	Well, while my husband's been out of town at the GameStop Manager Conference in Texas, I've been trying to entertain myself as best as I can.
139631	140511	Lots of Nintendogs.
141472	143992	I've been playing lots of World of Warcraft, which is excellent.
145633	152975	And actually hopping over on the MAME and playing Puyo Puyo, Blazing Star, Polestar, Metal Slug 5, Kix...
155216	157218	PC Engine Core Graphics to play more Valkyrie Densetsu
171860	177702	I want to come over sometime because I don't know anywhere else where I could play this except your house, which is the Walking Talking Video Game Museum.
178122	179303	I want to play Alien Crush.
179943	180323	I have it.
180543	182644	I have this urge for some TurboGrafx.
182664	184264	I have Alien Crush and Devil's Crush.
184345	187646	You know, I want to play the Crush games, I want to play Splatterhouse, and I want to play Bonk.
187746	189887	So we need to have a TurboGrafx night, and I know you would have it all.
189907	195529	You know what, we need to, I need to get two more controllers, but we hook up the multi-tap and it's all about four-player Bomberman.
197170	197491	I'm down.
197792	198795	I have Batman 94.
199417	200540	We've got to do that.
200641	201864	We can talk about that on a future podcast.
201884	203228	And the Marathon Dracula X.
205596	207917	Speaking of kicks, I have to ask Loki real quick.
208858	216401	Arcade Infinity in L.A., which has a lot of import games, a lot of Japanese games, I remember one time we went there.
216521	218262	I think we took a random trip to L.A.
218662	225986	like last Christmas or something, and there was a game that you were playing nonstop that was very much like kicks, except it was a woman's dress.
226426	231568	And as you would trace the lines around the woman's dress, I guess it would fall off or whatever it was.
231648	232389	What was that game?
232429	233309	Do you remember anything about this?
233509	235030	I don't remember what the 3D game was.
235866	237327	because they had a 3D game.
237387	238707	That was one of them that I was playing.
238727	246570	But the other games that I play, I still play religiously on, well, when I have the damn PC for my main cabinet, Gal's Panic.
247571	248411	Of course, of course.
249271	251532	Miss World was a bastardization of 6.
251572	252493	That was crap.
253213	256794	But the other one, the 3D one, I don't remember what it's called, but that one was a lot of fun too.
256814	257575	That was a little different.
258155	261896	I actually played all the way through that twice when we were there the last time.
261916	262336	Cool.
262657	263597	Anything else in your gaming world?
265036	267299	I'm actually handing down a copy of Chowai Nikki.
268099	268480	What's that?
269020	272403	Interesting little shooter game that has, like, musclemen in it.
273765	274045	Okay.
274065	275947	And, like, these fantasy-looking characters.
276307	279490	It's in the family of Parodius, as far as the type of game.
279510	280751	But it's what, guys?
281672	282573	It's really weird.
283013	284114	It means super big brother.
285756	286036	Okay.
286597	286677	Um...
289924	295547	The first in the series had these two sort of fantasy-looking characters, and they would fly around and shoot things.
295627	303530	And later on, they had these two just really... It's hard to describe them, but they were shiny.
304391	307372	Musclemen and Speedos, who would go around shooting stuff.
308092	308993	They even did a...
313760	316502	A real life, like how Mortal Kombat was.
317303	318905	The stop animation.
319265	320286	Not like Pit Fighter.
320426	321327	Yeah, motion capture.
321367	329414	But not really motion capture because they were kind of like Pit Fighter where you take the pictures of people in different poses and then you animate them.
329514	331716	Pit Fighter is one of my least favorite arcade games of all time.
332436	332897	DarkSakura.com
350094	356278	And hey, if you want to see me slap down $1,000 on a video game, find me a copy of Rainbow Cotton.
357319	358640	Not Rainbow Cotton, Panorama Cotton.
359801	362082	I've heard you talk about this game before.
362122	363043	What's so great about this game?
364433	365674	Okay, the Cotton series of games.
365734	368856	We actually got one in the States on Neo Geo Pocket Color.
369036	373118	It's about a little witch who's addicted to this candy called Willow that makes her puke.
374599	377020	And it was a side-scrolling game.
378601	383244	And for anyone who has a Dreamcast, Rainbow Cotton was the one on Dreamcast, but this one is a behind-the-view one.
383724	390788	The really cool thing about it on the Genesis, first of all, they only made something like 600 copies, so it was very limited edition.
391708	397710	and it had really advanced scrolling techniques that you really at the time could only see on Super Nintendo.
398350	398590	Wow.
399070	399230	Alright.
399891	408293	Just, I say, it's the Gens emulator is the only one I know that will run it, but if you find the ROM of Panorama Cotton, give it a try.
408713	410614	Not Panorama, but, yeah, Panorama Cotton.
411172	411853	Wow, okay.
412073	414215	I have to see this just for the witch who's puking.
414275	415115	That sounds kind of weird.
415175	416296	I almost cosplayed her one year.
416516	422942	Actually, I will bring over my boot disc and my copy of Rainbow Cod to show you.
422982	423482	I want to check it out.
423502	423982	I want to check it out.
424183	424423	All right.
424843	425944	Loki, how's your game week been?
426444	427125	I played Burnout.
427706	428226	Revenge, yeah.
428286	428626	Again?
429027	430328	Hey, I played every break.
430708	431188	Every break.
431228	434411	Because we've got to race the cars and blow up and crash and all that fun stuff.
434853	434973	R.P.G.
434993	435153	Maker 3
463117	463957	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
493627	494267	Oh, what'd you think?
494488	494868	Pretty cool.
495028	495388	Pretty cool.
495468	498169	It has so much customization in it.
498229	498950	It's crazy.
499370	499610	Cool.
499930	502532	So, yeah, I'd say that's going to be a worthy purchase.
503272	504933	Still working on the RPG for us.
505453	505773	Still.
506094	506494	Alright.
507174	510036	Never going to finish it, but it'll... Orange Lounge the game.
510416	511877	Alright.
511897	513758	Better than Sky's Voice the game, wouldn't you think?
513818	514098	Yes, yes.
514778	516579	That's an old-ass live show joke.
516599	517300	I have to bring it up.
517380	517620	I know.
517680	518440	It's like two years old.
518540	518880	That's alright.
519361	521962	Did play some more Burnout Legends, and that game's still fun.
522540	523760	Burnout, Burnout, Burnout, Burnout.
525041	527601	I'm going to play other things than Burnout this week, I promise.
528341	528681	You know what?
528741	533902	Actually, my week wasn't much better because I pretty much played games I've already talked about on the show, so I don't have a whole lot else to add.
533962	534282	Sorry.
535003	538463	You know, the usual Final Fantasy XI.
538823	545525	A lot of We Heart Katamari because I picked up that game this week and I've just been playing the shit out of it.
545645	551126	I mean, honestly, if you liked the first game, I love some of the things they did with this game.
551166	551306	Now,
551906	558133	Jamie, I know on the three-hour show tonight you expressed your difficulties you're having with We Heart Katamari, but I'm saving this.
558574	559695	I saved this just for you.
559975	564240	There's a stage in We Heart Katamari where you get to roll around a big ball of fire.
565273	565953	I like fire.
566033	571216	It's a giant ball of fire and the goal is to take this fire and light a wood pile on fire.
571477	573358	And you roll over objects to make your ball bigger.
573658	577020	Except it's the one stage where you can't roll over people for obvious reasons.
577280	577700	Damn!
577760	583203	If you do hit people though, they catch on fire and they run away screaming and they'll jump into ponds and rivers and stuff.
583744	584704	That is excellent.
585004	587286	So, does that redeem the game a little bit for you?
587766	589047	It's not the game I'm mad at.
589267	589707	I know, I know.
589747	591028	I'm mad at everyone talking about it.
591781	592343	I had to.
592523	594346	It was a big part of my gaming weekend.
594887	595268	Deal.
595709	596110	Deal.
596451	597533	I gotta mention one more thing.
597573	597773	What?
598154	599957	You know how you got Mortal Kombat Shell and Monks?
599997	600198	Yes.
601120	602262	Before it was supposed to come out.
603204	603745	Was it really?
604127	609251	Yeah, it wasn't supposed to street until the 21st, and Midway... I got Midway in trouble, and that was fun.
609471	609832	Really?
609952	610692	I snitched on them.
611133	611953	You snitched?
612073	612674	What happened?
612754	614195	No, um, they don't know.
614616	617718	They don't know, but it was not supposed to be in stores until the 21st.
617758	620240	Well, lucky me, I guess.
620300	627586	So, it was once again one of those things that I got at our purchasing department to call them, and Midway's like, I don't even know what happened.
627786	630729	So, they've got something explaining to do.
631482	632022	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
653715	656036	Dragon Quest VIII has a street date.
656096	659198	Dragon Quest VIII will be coming out November 22nd.
659218	660699	Hmm, what else is happening November 22nd?
660779	660839	No.
660859	662680	This is coming from a gaming website here.
662700	664461	I don't know if they just changed it or what.
664541	666161	Well, if they just changed it, cool.
666181	667242	Otherwise, it's December.
681816	684518	Dragon Quest VIII will come with a playable demo of Final Fantasy XII.
701900	703420	So that's... Cha-ching!
703620	705421	Exactly, I think that's the change.
705501	713963	I think that's what happened is now they're putting in this demo of Final Fantasy XII to try and take a little bit, even though the Xbox 360 is going to be huge, a little bit of attention away from that.
714283	723926	The only gripe I have about this game is it's done by the same artist that does Dragon Ball Z and I hate Dragon Ball Z. I hate it to death and it just looks like Dragon Ball Z the game again.
725046	726988	I'm sick enough that I will buy this just for the demo.
727008	727608	Here's the thing, though.
727648	730009	There's nothing coming out really the week of the 22nd.
730149	737914	There is about 500 titles coming out in the week of the 15th, which is annoying as hell for people that are preparing.
738034	743437	All the 360 launch games are coming out that day, or the week before, which is nice because I get mine shipped early.
745576	748357	I understand, though, because they all want to cash in on the day after Thanksgiving.
748497	749097	I mean, you have to.
749117	754179	You have to have your games out by then, or they're not going to be a part of the Christmas season, you know, unless you release them.
754760	759862	But every day you lose between November 26th or, I don't know, I don't have a calendar for it.
759942	761823	A lot of good games coming out that day.
762443	764504	King Kong, the 50 Cent game.
765939	766239	DDR Max 2 VRare
787037	792003	DDR Max 2 came out two years ago, but the VRare, you can't find it now.
792263	796608	So if you don't already have a copy of this VRare, this is one of the only ways you're going to get it short of eBay.
796948	799571	So we already gave one away on the live show tonight.
799611	802494	Congrats to Fireboma, who won the...
804116	805037	We'll see you next time.
826754	827275	What would you call that?
828195	830737	Restrictions other than multiple entries.
831057	831998	Multiple entries.
832098	834620	We will catch you and we will disqualify you completely.
835280	837582	One entry per person, please.
838162	840343	No strings attached to the contest.
840383	841244	You just send us an email.
841324	842385	You don't have to send us a...
843739	844080	I don't know.
844260	845881	No zombies apply.
846262	847302	All you have to do is send us an email.
847322	847803	It's that simple.
847823	848824	We'll pick one and we'll give it away.
849064	850505	And it's not the last time we're going to be doing this.
850565	853528	We're going to be having some more kick-ass stuff coming your way.
853568	854288	More games and stuff.
854388	854849	Absolutely.
854889	858952	We're starting to get the hook up, so we're going to give away more games throughout future podcasts.
859012	859553	I've got it.
860208	861009	I got some.
861270	861951	I got a supply.
876232	877393	and I just dropped it on the ground.
877653	881014	We've all already defaced it.
881074	884656	It's not a sealed copy because we've all autographed it among other things.
885277	887418	We put our own spin on this copy of In the Groove.
887438	888678	Just look at the inside cover.
888718	890979	We're giving it away to a lucky listener.
891039	892820	However, this one's a little more complicated.
893361	895182	You have to show your poetic side.
895542	905907	You must send your best haiku about In the Groove to this email address haiku at orangelaunchradio.com For those of you guys that can't spell, that's H
906287	909628	DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
932498	934480	We had such a great show last week, didn't we?
955422	955963	DarkSakura.com
975080	979566	And remember, guys, we do this because we can't talk about video games all day long.
979906	986515	Because if all we ever did is talk about video games all day long, we'd have no time to deface PlayStation 2 games and give them away.
987676	989018	Although it is a completely working copy.
989058	989759	We didn't ruin the game.
992737	999202	And for those of you guys that are getting a little angsty, fans at home, by the way, saying, why do you guys have to do that to Indigree?
999342	999942	Because we can.
1000423	1001223	That's why we're giving it away.
1001263	1001724	Because we can.
1001804	1007748	We bought one, wrote on it, and now we're giving it away because we can.
1008108	1012812	I personally didn't like the game, so I bought one just so I could write, this game sucks on it.
1012972	1015334	That's what I did, and we just went a little further from that.
1015354	1016114	But think of it this way.
1016374	1017916	Loki supported Indigree.
1017996	1019737	We did not get this free from the company.
1020413	1021034	DarkSakura DarkSakura
1045953	1048574	Today's piece of advice is how to survive a hit and run.
1050074	1054616	Number one, if a car is headed directly for you, assess the amount of time you have.
1055016	1057036	Like, oh shit, I got five minutes!
1057697	1058937	Or, oh shit, I'm dead!
1059177	1060657	Or, no!
1061218	1061858	Steve Muller.
1062478	1066839	Two, dive and roll out of the car's path if you have enough time before impact.
1067279	1069920	You may get some cuts and bruises, but you will not get run over.
1070560	1070941	Duh!
1071701	1071861	Sorry.
1073008	1076530	3.
1073628	1076530	If you can't get out of the way, jump as high as you can before impact.
1076890	1080112	Jump in a tight tuck or ball position with your arms over your head.
1080752	1083053	Jump in profile with your shoulder toward the car.
1083113	1084774	This exposes fewer vital organs.
1085715	1084774	4.
1085855	1086675	Brace for impact.
1087236	1088676	You will probably hit the windshield.
1089797	1088676	5.
1090357	1092558	Roll onto and off the windshield.
1093639	1092558	6.
1094059	1096480	Stay rolled into a ball and brace yourself for when you hit the ground.
1096540	1098041	Keep your arms over your head. 7.
1099912	1100612	Hey, I heard a rumor.
1100652	1100712	Hmm.
1124932	1126453	That I read online, so it must be true.
1126693	1127053	What's that?
1127633	1131856	That there's a huge rumor that News Corp is going to be buying NCSoft.
1132796	1133237	Really?
1133677	1135278	Yep, we know what NCSoft brought us.
1135458	1137399	Didn't they bring us Guild Wars?
1137499	1141361	Guild Wars, City of Heroes, Lineage, City of Villains.
1142445	1150813	It's funny that you bring up Guild Wars because I was just about to get to the next story that Guild Wars actually sold 1 million copies.
1150933	1152114	They are very happy about that.
1152154	1155177	Sold their 1 millionth copy of the game since the game launched in April.
1155597	1160101	And to celebrate, Guild Wars Special Edition on October 21st.
1160202	1161262	But the catch?
1162484	1162864	In Europe.
1164161	1165602	The special edition.
1165642	1168184	So this is a chance for the Europe folks to get this before we do.
1168485	1170987	Because we're not getting it in North America until April.
1171687	1174289	So check that out.
1174710	1175711	$49.99 for a copy of Guild Wars.
1175791	1176852	I've actually played this game.
1177452	1179874	What I really like about Guild Wars, I think it's a pretty game.
1180194	1184098	And I like the fact that I can leave it for a few weeks and then just go back.
1184138	1187861	And it's not like I had these fees that were accruing the whole time I didn't play.
1189122	1190883	Guild Wars has a really neat business model there.
1190923	1191524	So I like Guild Wars.
1192825	1194469	I didn't get into Guild Wars.
1195310	1196413	I saw it, I didn't care for it.
1196994	1200882	But there are other special editions popping up on other things, aren't there?
1202465	1203587	Why don't you enlighten us?
1204292	1206413	Well, what about Nintendog Special Edition?
1206833	1209355	Ah, yeah, okay, I just, I didn't know which one you were mentioning about.
1209615	1210556	Sure, you want to talk about this?
1210596	1211256	You want me to talk about it?
1211276	1211776	Why don't you?
1212116	1212917	I certainly will.
1213257	1217099	Nintendog Special Edition will be coming out just in time for the holiday season.
1217580	1218880	October 24th is the date.
1218900	1220681	$149.99 is the price that it'll set you back.
1220701	1221262	Wait a minute.
1224395	1227817	Oh yes, it's not just the game, it's a brand new DS as well.
1227857	1229619	So the DS is $149.99.
1230799	1233561	Brand new colors of DSs, by the way.
1233681	1234402	Brand new colors.
1234482	1237364	It's pink and I believe teal was the other color.
1237744	1238565	Pink and teal.
1239005	1240986	Comes with a brand new edition of Nintendogs.
1241046	1246390	It's the Best Friends edition, which will have some of the more popular brands from across the three games.
1246850	1252295	Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, German Shepherd, Beagle, Yorkshire Terrier, and Miniature Dachshund.
1253215	1255477	However, it's not limited to just those six.
1255957	1263183	All 18, just like in the other games, you can unlock all 18 breeds and secretly there's a 19th we know of, the Dalmatian.
1263684	1265765	You can unlock these in the Best Friends game.
1265805	1266946	If you have the Fireman's Hat.
1267106	1269208	Just like you can unlock in the other games as well.
1269228	1270349	And I've seen the Dalmatian.
1270429	1272911	It's cute because my friend finally got a Fireman's Hat.
1273240	1273640	That's cool.
1274280	1276841	And you can actually unlock other stuff, too, if you play the game long enough.
1276881	1280102	Like, I just unlocked a new room by getting enough trainer points.
1280682	1282643	I actually unlocked the ranch-style house.
1283203	1283744	Oh, okay, cool.
1283784	1286825	Of course, I bought the tatami house instead.
1287385	1287545	Right.
1287705	1291106	I have some really ugly glasses, and I got some stupid sleepy time records.
1291551	1296835	I have to admit, I'm actually getting a little sick of Nintendogs, but I'm going to try and stick with it, because I just... I like my puppies.
1296975	1301739	It's just the kill time until Animal Crossing DS comes out, which is in December.
1301839	1309205	I just wanted to state real quick, you also get with this package a bone-shaped screen cleaner and a paw print Nintendog skin for the system.
1310266	1310466	Aww.
1310846	1315189	I actually have a Nintendog skin for my DS.
1315570	1316010	Oh, cool.
1316671	1318872	And it's adorable, and it's one of those removable kind.
1319513	1319633	Hmm.
1320154	1333274	Yeah, those, I'm trying to remember who puts them out, but these Nintendog skins, you can completely save them any time later, and they are, they actually add a bit more softness to holding the system, so that actually, I can play for longer.
1333996	1334536	Oh, cool.
1335171	1336813	The Line to Meet Miyamoto was...
1356638	1356998	Huge.
1357378	1357678	Huge.
1357718	1358479	Pretty tremendous.
1358639	1360660	He said he saw signed power gloves and everything.
1361000	1364481	Why would so many people want to come meet Miyamoto, and why is Miyamoto showing up anyway?
1364721	1369163	Well, Miyamoto was there to help promote Nintendogs at the Nintendo World Store.
1369943	1370363	Get this.
1370724	1376246	The first ten people in line got to do Bark Mode with Miyamoto.
1376846	1377987	That's cool.
1378587	1382830	How cool would that be to have Miyamoto's profile in your friends list on your DS?
1382890	1392095	So we heard that, I think somebody had said, I think he had said when he called in that the first person in line was some guy that flew in from Detroit and was there at like Saturday.
1392515	1397578	So this guy definitely earned it, the bark mode with Miyamoto.
1397878	1403061	200 people were receiving an autograph from Miyamoto.
1404673	1405453	Very interesting, though.
1405793	1407874	I'm sure that a lot of DSs were there.
1408234	1417677	I saw people dressed up as Nintendo characters in the pictures we saw, and I'm sure PictoChat galore, Nintendog, BarkMode galore, probably everybody there unlocked all 18 dogs.
1417897	1419838	They were also passing out autographed skins.
1420338	1420818	Oh, cool.
1420878	1427220	But apparently they were in gold and silver, which means that the ones that I got with the Nintendo press kit at E3 was a different one.
1427740	1427980	Hmm.
1428560	1431641	So I thought that was pretty interesting that they had those that they were giving out.
1431661	1432542	Apparently there were a lot of them.
1433022	1433462	Interesting.
1433482	1433962	Interesting.
1434369	1435590	Loki, what do you got for us tonight?
1435630	1437190	Something going on in the hack and crack world.
1437251	1440032	I know that there was big, big news in the hack and crack world this week.
1440052	1440772	You've got to share this.
1440832	1442333	Yeah, of course.
1442953	1453579	Those people out there trying to break the PSP, they found a way to utilize the photo gallery to actually do what they call a buffer overrun.
1454059	1455440	It allows you basically to...
1456033	1460155	Overload the memory of the PSP to run your own code in there.
1460675	1466418	And they've done everything from Hello World to some sort of Pong demo, which is interesting.
1467138	1468439	But this is only the beginning.
1468499	1475622	This is kind of a way to maybe possibly run homebrew stuff on 2.0 PSP since the downgrader is probably never going to come out.
1475682	1478163	So, hey, it's something cool.
1479084	1480685	That was one of the cool things.
1480725	1482926	The other one that was worth mentioning is...
1484557	1495726	There's actually a guy who goes by the name Raph, and he's working on PSP Radio, which is actually a shoutcast program that you can use to listen to shoutcast streams, which is kind of cool.
1496227	1499049	So they've got that coming out, and he's still working on that.
1499950	1505254	Now, aside from the PSP, we've got some stuff on the DS.
1505314	1510018	The first thing is the Wi-Fi is almost done being hacked.
1510898	1513921	Actually, the guy working on it right now is...
1514642	1517804	Trying to create an IRC program for it, which would be really cool.
1518004	1519585	Okay, that would be cool.
1519645	1521947	So he's shooting for the prize.
1522027	1524528	I think it was over $2,000 to do that.
1525509	1530592	And other than that, lots of DS stuff coming out in November here.
1530932	1537237	My favorite being Mario Kart DS, which is going to feature all the tracks from, or select tracks from all the series.
1537577	1541940	Everything from the GameCube versions to the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo, Super Nintendo, all that stuff.
1542040	1542620	Rainbow Road.
1543140	1544201	Yep, that kind of stuff.
1545253	1573148	and then on top of all that the one I wanted to mention was about the Game Boy Micro and this is kind of interesting someone noticed that when you take the cover off the Game Boy Micro because they have those interchangeable covers the faceplates that there's actually a port that's a 5 volt power port for it and what they're speculating is later on you're going to get faceplates that blink or do weird things or light up or all sorts of weird things so you can have
1573541	1574702	Game Boy Micro Game Boy Micro
1596079	1599663	From what I can see on this, they actually are doing internet-only orders.
1599723	1601825	The last update on the site was on the 13th.
1604647	1621243	Unfortunately, my Japanese reading is not the very best, but it looks like they're taking the orders on Amazon, JP, Tsutaya, Yodobashi, Toys R Us, Nintendo, Yamada Denki, Softmap, some of those sites.
1622003	1624925	But it looks like it's online order only for those.
1625565	1631648	And it is actually different than the play-on they had for the DS and the SP.
1631668	1634790	This one is specifically built for the Micro.
1638952	1642934	Specs on it, MP3, MPEG, one layer three, you know, the usual.
1644775	1646296	It says it can go up to 128K.
1646696	1646756	Hmm.
1650979	1655864	as far as the... It also will do MPEG-4 video, ASF.
1656024	1657345	Wait, but 128Ks?
1657565	1659547	Oh, no, all I see is the band... Never mind.
1659747	1663491	I thought that was like how much it would hold, and I'm like... No, no, that's... You can't do video with that much.
1663671	1664151	Okay, got it.
1664812	1668816	But it's looking like it's going to rely mostly on the MPEG-4 format for video.
1668836	1670757	Cool.
1671378	1675362	Just trying to double check, because, again, a lot of this is in...
1678203	1681006	Actually, it's saying that it can get up to 320k.
1682047	1682627	Okay, cool.
1682687	1688472	That's good, because I was going to say, a lot of MP3s, I know I code all mine in 160, so if it capped at 128, that would kind of suck.
1690634	1695018	Again, I'm having to sort of wrap my mind around some of these kanji that I'm not familiar with.
1695058	1695579	That's alright.
1695719	1698542	While you're doing that, let me read one other quick story on the micro while we're on that.
1699222	1702765	I wanted to mention this, that the micro actually came out this week in Japan.
1702825	1707229	Now, we're getting it this week, I believe, the 26th or 27th is when we're getting it?
1707289	1708030	Probably the 27th.
1708470	1712594	We're getting it this week, but Japan just got it, and how well is it doing in Japan?
1713054	1718339	Well, it's actually kind of being seen more as a collectible than an actual system.
1718379	1723303	It's kind of selling as more of a collectible, but that isn't stopping it from selling huge.
1723584	1724625	For the week of September 12th,
1725345	1725886	Thank you for watching!
1746207	1750771	Also, I believe Earthbound 1 and 2 is on its way to Advance.
1750831	1756196	I don't know if that already came out or just came out, but I know I'm really excited about that because I want to check out this game.
1756537	1756877	That'll be cool.
1757389	1758309	I hope they put it out over here.
1758869	1760850	Jamie, any other details on the player?
1761190	1783595	I think it's going over something about media stage that for anything that's 384 looks like K per second and 512 it streams at 30 frames per second but seeing something else about 256 at 15 frames per second so I'm not really getting too much more out of that.
1783886	1784566	We love you in Australia.
1784606	1785327	Send us a plane ticket.
1785347	1787107	We love all our listeners worldwide.
1787167	1787747	You could be in Antarctica.
1812645	1814966	Thank you guys worldwide for checking us out.
1815026	1816307	Did you see the rain down in Africa?
1838499	1840300	Hush up and get to the news.
1840540	1841740	Okay, bad 80s reference.
1841980	1845061	I have a little bit of UK news.
1845101	1846661	I've been trying to dig up something fun.
1847301	1848642	There's a brighter SP coming out.
1850362	1855184	I actually heard about this, that they're kind of just promoting it as a brighter screen.
1855204	1862966	Well, Nintendo confirmed to Eurogamer that the backlit version of the Game Boy Advance SP is coming out to Europe in graphite and pearl blue.
1864936	1870944	The ones that we got, they're actually coming out with the new backlit screens in Europe, too.
1871144	1873467	There's no date listed yet.
1873648	1876952	They'll be about the same brightness as the micro, actually.
1877052	1879596	They showed a side-by-side picture with the old one and the new one.
1879676	1880477	Those micros were...
1880797	1881358	They were bright.
1881378	1881778	Flashlights.
1881898	1882459	They were great.
1883300	1899419	Another thing referenced that according to the Nintendo spokesperson for UK actually stating now the technology has come down in price enough for backlights to be affordable so basically people aren't going to have to pay anymore for it.
1899559	1900440	It's just going to be there.
1902591	1902931	Very cool.
1903391	1903671	All right.
1904972	1908853	I got a story here now on EB Games, the retailer.
1909333	1912814	They're sold out of Xbox 360s, and the darn thing hasn't even come out yet.
1913694	1920656	If you go to their online store, you're going to get a message that says, We are currently sold out of our popular Xbox 360 bundles.
1921056	1925257	Check back frequently for more opportunities to pre-order an Xbox 360.
1925717	1928218	I hear GameStop is also...
1929048	1930190	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1944048	1949051	General, Xbox 360s, both the Basics and the Super Pack.
1949131	1950192	I don't remember what they're calling them.
1950552	1951793	The 300 and the 400 one.
1952133	1954335	Xbox 360 and Xbox 360 Core.
1954535	1954915	Thank you.
1955976	1957096	You can still buy those.
1957457	1961799	Or you can do what I do, and I like to rush the store the day it comes out.
1961919	1963781	Rush Best Buy or somebody that doesn't do pre-orders.
1963941	1965442	Mine's already paid for all the way.
1965562	1967423	I'm going to rush a store when it comes out.
1967503	1968283	I don't know which one yet.
1968383	1969164	I have a store in mind.
1969918	1969958	D.D.
1969998	1970298	Arcaholic D.D.
1970318	1970498	Arcaholic
1995922	1996262	Donovan Kiyoshi
2016480	2021802	And this would be a controller for the Xbox 360 was sold on eBay.
2021822	2023483	They have one now that's for $91.
2023623	2027044	It was actually purchased and ended.
2027524	2034047	But there's actually another one up on eBay right now that's for sale and it's going in the $160 range for price.
2034407	2038008	And you know, really people, I don't know why you're buying this because it's retarded.
2038328	2039309	It's coming back out.
2039389	2041670	I mean, the system stuff is going to be sold, the accessories.
2042130	2043951	I can tell you this much, the quarter controller is like $30.
2045256	2047538	Do not spend $160 for a corded controller.
2047838	2049340	Having it early will do you nothing.
2050381	2052803	Except you can lick it, like the girl did with the PSP.
2053203	2057107	I was going to do that if I won that, but I would not bid on this for the life of me, no.
2057487	2060910	I mean, maybe a system?
2061111	2061311	Why?
2061351	2062612	Your system's going to come with one.
2062632	2063132	Just wait.
2063733	2064213	Exactly.
2064313	2065635	It's just, why?
2065875	2066355	Why, people?
2066455	2067877	Why do you have to spend the money on this?
2068769	2071350	Alright, I got another story that's Microsoft related.
2071390	2074950	Of course, last week's show we were talking an awful lot about the Nintendo revolution.
2075310	2083212	Well, Microsoft has surprisingly come out and kind of professionally congratulated Nintendo on this, well, now don't shake your head just yet, Loki.
2084793	2090614	Actually, Xbox VP of Worldwide Marketing and Publishing, Peter Moore,
2091114	2096355	said, quote, I want to give kudos for Nintendo for its attempt at innovation with the new controller.
2097816	2098436	Dot, dot, dot.
2098676	2106077	Bring people in that, as Iwata-san said, are either lapsed gamers or gamers that are intimidated by the complexity of the controller.
2106577	2108258	So they're kind of giving a little pat on the back there.
2108278	2113019	But I hear now rumor is that Microsoft is coming up with their own thing that's going to
2113692	2114633	I had a ColecoVision.
2141307	2144213	And the controller was the greatest thing ever for Mousetrap.
2144793	2148216	My best friend in elementary school had a Coleco.
2148797	2151339	We mean the 9-button thing with the joystick.
2151359	2154302	You had the disc and the little buttons that you would hit at the top.
2154322	2155683	Yeah, we used to have one of those.
2155703	2157004	It was a piece of crap.
2157665	2161968	The number pad, though, if you're playing on the ColecoVision, the number pad was excellent.
2162489	2166152	It was awesome that he slipped the little sheets in there to tell you which buttons to do what.
2166192	2167073	Like I said, mousetrap.
2167153	2167834	It's all about mousetrap.
2167854	2169235	Good idea in theory, but it didn't work.
2169255	2169956	It did, too, work.
2170676	2170956	DarkSakura,
2195487	2201990	I know, Grand Theft Auto The Trilogy will be coming out for the Xbox, and it's GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas.
2202031	2203831	That shouldn't be any big surprise.
2204332	2209935	But get this, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas Special Edition will be coming out for the PlayStation 2.
2210495	2214157	Hmm, this would be the version that has the hot coffee taken out of it, of course.
2214737	2216779	and some extra features as well.
2218161	2221644	Don't know exactly what the special is that's going to be there.
2221664	2226369	No, what it is, the special edition is their stupid documentary that they're filming about the lowrider.
2226389	2227750	Oh, I thought that was a separate thing.
2227930	2229272	Nope, that's the special edition.
2229312	2232675	It's bundled with it and that's the DVD for it.
2232715	2233316	Okay, I get it.
2233556	2236119	But there's also the PSP version they're going to release as well.
2236139	2237420	That's why I had two separate stories for that.
2237520	2238521	DarkSakura, what else have you got for us tonight
2255140	2260822	The game that I have been highly anticipating myself is the Final Fantasy 7 Dirge of Cerberus.
2261743	2269306	Because I have to say, I don't go, ooh, bishona, bishies, blah, blah, blah, because I think that's kind of retarded.
2269866	2274628	But I do have my fangirlism for Vincent, because I was like, so cool.
2274768	2276969	The whole dark, brooding type.
2277129	2279650	The one character I never unlocked my first time through Final Fantasy 7.
2279730	2280190	Go figure.
2280490	2281170	I totally missed him.
2282091	2283171	I never opened that damn safe.
2284551	2287352	Go in the door and talk to him in the coffin, and I got it right the first time.
2287752	2290673	Without the manual, so it meant to be.
2291253	2295754	Anyway, we have updates on Dirge of Sebris as far as the gameplay.
2296455	2299936	Now, we've seen movie files where it shows it to be sort of a first person.
2300296	2305057	However, it's actually behind the shoulder third person where you can switch to a first person view.
2305377	2307758	So that's kind of like Resident Evil 4 a little bit?
2308198	2315381	It actually, IGN, an article I read on IGN does refer to Resident Evil 4 in comparison to the aiming mode.
2316501	2321943	However, you switch between melee and three different types of guns.
2323092	2327756	So they're saying it's kind of a disjointed way to play the game, but then again, it's not complete.
2328576	2333821	Another thing right now is that, for anyone else who's been keeping up with it, the beta was delayed from September 1st.
2333941	2342608	Well, the beta is starting, which is what I think is excellent, focusing toward the PlayOnline members who signed up to participate, so of course it's only in Japan.
2344889	2348572	But it is actually going into effect starting...
2351134	2356417	From the date of this, I'm seeing it actually was going into effect on the 22nd, so they are already in progress.
2357417	2360819	And it's shipped to beta testing kits to the PlayOnline members.
2362219	2362520	Cool.
2362640	2366261	But it's looking pretty... I've also got a trailer.
2367102	2368062	I found the link to it now.
2368082	2368863	It seems pretty big.
2368903	2372524	I haven't watched it yet, because I actually just found it tonight before the show.
2373485	2375946	But I'm going to give that a watch and see what happens.
2376727	2378929	Speaking of trailers, I have to interject this here real quick.
2379610	2383393	I don't know if either of you guys saw it, but I saw the trailer from Tokyo Game Show.
2383433	2386015	Some guy filmed this on a camera for Gran Turismo 5.
2387774	2389576	Oh my gosh, did that game look sexy.
2390016	2395381	I mean, just realistic to the T. I mean, and I know we say that with every system that comes out.
2395501	2396622	Oh, the graphics are so realistic.
2396642	2397603	Oh, the graphics are so realistic.
2397844	2398684	But seriously, guys.
2399245	2400546	Seriously, this time.
2400586	2401167	Seriously.
2401647	2402168	Realistic.
2402348	2403929	Everything next-gen looks that way.
2404770	2406532	Project Gotham Racing, I mean...
2407461	2407881	It's awesome.
2408461	2411563	Gran Turismo always pushes the boundaries with graphics.
2412023	2415584	They always really just run away with it, graphically wise.
2415764	2416945	And this is no different.
2417025	2417645	This really isn't.
2417705	2418926	It looks superb.
2419206	2422207	Can you imagine now, Loki, burnout looking like this on a next-gen system?
2422427	2424148	It is coming out in March.
2424348	2425388	Oh, it's going to be so hot.
2425969	2428049	I've already got my eyes set on it.
2428610	2429370	It's a matter of time.
2429390	2434212	We're going to have a lapse in burnout here with Project Gotham Racing coming in.
2435156	2437998	I'm actually trying to pick up three or four games that launch for the 360.
2438418	2439039	Wow.
2439539	2447924	I'm eyeing up Gears of War, but still to be determined because they haven't announced a price for it yet, which means it can move.
2449525	2454468	There's also Project Gotham Racing 3, and then some other one, probably like an RPG.
2455469	2456630	Let's go back over to Dark Sakura.
2457570	2459892	I would like to poke around in our...
2460945	2461385	Mailbox.
2461625	2469748	Of course, we can't forget the listeners who email us every week at our email address, togo, T-O-G-O at orangeloungeradio.com.
2470288	2474169	DarkSakura reads and responds to you, some of them on air.
2474609	2475969	Who wrote us this week, DarkSakura?
2476069	2477650	I do want to give a nod toward...
2479430	2483433	I got an email from a guy named Deacon Deakman.
2483793	2484613	I thought it was pretty cool.
2484693	2486634	Oh, he's one of those guys on the forums from Australia.
2486914	2499321	Right, and he actually also informed about trying to get the PSP 2.0 firmware and the security flaw about the photos and the DS.
2499361	2500341	So I thought that was cool.
2500361	2501882	He's also keeping track of it.
2502711	2509459	He also made a brand new set of emote icons for our forums that are all, I hate to say it, Jamie, but they're all Katamari Damacy related.
2509599	2510020	That's fine.
2510060	2510921	But they're cute!
2511101	2511962	They're so cute!
2512402	2513383	I think it's awesome.
2513484	2515766	We're going to put them up as soon as we figure out how.
2516087	2522254	We also got an email from Alv who just says, Ragnarok, Pekos, heal please, yay.
2523802	2527924	I thought that would, that just amused me because I was like, oh yeah, it's someone who plays.
2527944	2535528	So that was that 5% I was referencing last week when I said 5% of our listeners will understand the Ragnarok jokes.
2536129	2536909	Alright, cute.
2537429	2539811	Also got an email from Q in Singapore.
2540651	2542412	I think I'm spelling that right, pronouncing it right.
2543052	2546714	Just says that Buzz Orange Lounge Radio wanted to know about the songs.
2546734	2550636	I actually emailed back stating, you know, about Orange Lounge and Tawosuke and...
2552097	2553738	for to get the Beatmania CDs.
2554018	2555598	There's that worldwide thing I was talking about.
2555638	2558880	Thanks for emailing us and letting us know that we have listeners worldwide.
2559160	2565602	I got a good email from Mike D who's actually on 1up.com.
2566402	2570724	He wrote a pretty interesting blog about people reading user and licensing.
2571344	2573285	Apparently there's some funny stuff thrown in there.
2574725	2581068	Just to go ahead, it says a people scammed into downloading spyware by sneaking it into the licensing agreement.
2581428	2586770	And the thing is that legally, once you click that I agree, you are signing a contract.
2587090	2589491	And I even remember in my business law classes,
2590271	2593534	They even went into that where that is a legally binding document.
2603727	2604988	Aircraft Navigation or Communication Systems
2629125	2637752	Air Traffic Control Systems, Life Support Machines, or other equipment in which the failure or the software could lead to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage.
2637952	2638312	Duh.
2638652	2639853	That's part of the licensing agreement.
2639893	2640714	I think it's hilarious.
2640734	2641374	Like Windows?
2641415	2648840	I mean, they could sneak in there, you know, if you use this program and someone calls you a big weenie for using it, don't blame us, you know.
2649561	2653724	But I think it's, you know, people really should stop and read those licensing agreements.
2653744	2654965	Do we have a link to the article?
2656006	2679906	I do, it's minime283.oneup.com Okay, so some dude's blog on OneUp, okay Yeah, but, you know, major kudos to them for poisoning I think that's a very interesting thing Because I've even seen jokes snuck into licensing agreements Where it didn't affect the legality of the document one bit But it was, I've seen them done with humor Cool
2681553	2684497	It actually is a very, very, very valid point.
2686059	2688402	Also, again, we got one.
2688442	2695571	I just wanted you to make sure that we give our nods to people from Danzik who listed about the DS Wi-Fi that Loki just touched on.
2696972	2699613	But I'd just like to thank our listeners.
2699633	2707854	Keep sending them in to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com And we can't always read every email on the air because we just get a lot of them, but Jamie does read them all.
2708654	2719576	I do, and I reply to almost all of them, although honestly I'm at work, so I may not... If I seem a little distracted sometimes in my reply... And let me reiterate that.
2719636	2722897	When you send an email to go at OrangeLodgeRadio.com, Jamie does read them.
2724063	2728469	Yeah, which I found incredibly hilarious for one of the other emails I received.
2728489	2729990	Yes, one of the ones we don't read on the air.
2730791	2731092	Yeah.
2731212	2731772	We get it all.
2732954	2743586	Anything that we get, and I almost always reply to it unless it's just something like, oh my god, and then I'm just like, deleted.
2744775	2747136	Alright, well thank you guys who take out the time to email us.
2748096	2749876	And waste part of Jamie's work day.
2749956	2750697	We appreciate that.
2750757	2752437	No, waste it for a good cause.
2752717	2754678	Yeah, it definitely makes my day go faster.
2754718	2756678	2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, once again.
2757098	2758979	But remember, we have other email addresses this week.
2758999	2761740	We're going to have a full email because we've got our giveaway.
2762020	2765621	Don't forget, we're giving away DDR Extreme 2 and Max 2 VRares.
2766081	2768242	Free stuff at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2768282	2768762	Free stuff.
2768962	2769642	Just send an email.
2770162	2770982	Nothing else required.
2771042	2772123	Just say, hi, I want to win.
2772163	2772823	Whatever you want to put.
2772843	2773043	Nope.
2773223	2775224	We don't sell your email to anybody.
2775244	2775925	That's not cool.
2776365	2777186	No strings attached.
2777786	2779928	The other thing is the in the groove we're giving away.
2780128	2780768	Your haiku.
2780888	2783730	Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables.
2784291	2785932	Haiku at OrangeLaunchRadio.com
2786482	2787944	Just a couple stories left tonight.
2788524	2797194	Myst V is coming out, and they are calling this the final chapter in the PC adventure game saga coming out from Ubisoft.
2797835	2798936	I say, yeah, right.
2799036	2804182	As long as these games continue to sell, which I don't know how well Myst IV sold, but I don't think it was nearly as good as the first couple.
2804763	2804863	Um...
2805956	2808658	There will always be Myst games or other types.
2809999	2813441	$50 or $49.99 will be how much Myst 5 will set you back.
2814381	2817964	And Myst 5 coming out end of January is what they're looking at.
2818764	2825488	Also a limited edition coming out that includes a retrospective on DVD made by Turner Broadcasting.
2825848	2826349	So kind of a
2827270	2828351	Well produced documentary.
2828371	2830934	I'm sure it'll be $60 if you want that version.
2831194	2831795	Myst fans.
2832176	2833537	You know, Myst was a pretty cool game.
2834038	2836581	I think it's one of those series that maybe... I actually have it on Saturn somewhere.
2836881	2838844	I think it's one of those games that maybe jumped the shark a little bit.
2839204	2842588	And I was always... Didn't Myst come out around the same time as The Seventh Guest?
2842848	2843269	You remember that?
2843349	2844791	It was very kind of similar in a way.
2845031	2847052	I remember another game that was out at that time that I liked.
2847412	2848292	Phantasmagoria.
2848552	2849873	Oh, heck yeah, Phantasmagoria.
2849893	2851073	We need a new Phantasmagoria.
2851393	2854654	I don't think Roberta Williams is associated with Sierra anymore.
2854814	2855114	I don't know.
2855254	2857395	But anyway, Phantasmagoria, heck yeah.
2858676	2860056	Seventh Guest, heck yeah, missed.
2860236	2861236	Okay, sure, why not?
2861296	2862437	Actually, I liked Loom.
2863377	2866498	That's a whole other one.
2867038	2869699	All right, Loki, close us out tonight.
2869719	2871240	What are the last stories you got for us tonight?
2871300	2874081	The first one is, for some reason, unbeknownst to me...
2875453	2879356	Joanna Dark from Perfect Dark Zero is on the cover of 4Him Magazine.
2879977	2883159	Is this maybe a response to the Playboy thing?
2883580	2884901	Which, by the way, I still need to pick up.
2885621	2887943	I promise I will not let you guys down.
2888063	2889444	I will pick up the magazine.
2890305	2891386	Thanks.
2892147	2893588	So, yeah.
2893968	2899633	And then, finally, we see all those mods that shrink stuff down, make stuff portable.
2899833	2902375	Let's say we want to take something small and make it big.
2903752	2910580	G4 did it with their Nintendo controller, but I think this guy won up them by making the Nintendo Game Man.
2911421	2917709	And the Game Man is actually a 100-pound version of the Game Boy.
2917749	2917849	It's 6...
2918690	2920771	and a half times the scale of the Game Boy.
2920831	2923473	Well, the Game Boy's been out for like, what, 15 years now?
2923513	2925714	So it's had plenty of time to go through puberty and all that.
2925734	2927115	So it's matured into a man now.
2927155	2930737	Yes, it's over three feet tall and weighs just over 100 pounds.
2931417	2938802	And the cartridges, he actually made cartridges for it with Kirby's Dream Land, Pokemon Red, Super Mario Land, and Tetris.
2939182	2942203	And they're all very playable and they're eight pound cartridges.
2942884	2948207	And you can actually plug it in and they've got pictures on his website of him actually playing the game.
2948447	2954670	DarkSakura and I are sitting back here and we can't help but think of Now you're a man Man, man, man Anyway, forget it
2979008	2979468	Bad joke.
2979488	2981549	But if you guys got that, I hope you did.
2982109	2986251	But it should be noted, though, that the page here, it says copyright 2002.
2986472	2987692	So this is actually three years old.
2988092	2988853	This is an old thing.
2988893	2989833	How did you just find this?
2989873	2991534	Was it just on a blog lately or something?
2991934	2992194	Yes.
2992835	2993235	Oh, okay.
2993275	2993615	I get it.
2994075	2994375	All right.
2994395	2995096	Well, that's fine.
2995256	2996256	What are they going to make now?
2996316	2997397	The Game Man SP?
2999598	3000098	Maybe.
3000318	3000678	Shush.
3002859	3004100	What, geriatric game?
3005002	3009877	I don't know, it's just interesting I would like to see them make a 6.5 scale DS
3012639	3013219	That'd be cool.
3013359	3016540	Or you just, you have to rub your whole body on it to get anything going.
3016560	3018080	You have to just wipe it with your hands.
3018340	3023221	I completely forgot one last thing I gotta mention because this was just funny that I saw this.
3023842	3027683	For the DS, someone actually made a homebrew game called Tickle Girl.
3028263	3029223	Oh no.
3029363	3033104	And you gotta see the screen, or the box art that they made for it.
3033164	3034184	It was quite hilarious.
3034404	3037945	Is it what we think a game called Tickle Girl for the DS would be?
3038845	3047090	It says Tickle Girl version 1.0 and it says basically it's a multimedia experience where you interact with a virtual vixen via the touchscreen.
3047130	3050152	Tickle different areas of your dream girl to watch her reaction.
3050232	3053594	Utilizes full motion video, sampled audio, and looping background music.
3053714	3061959	Don't we feel the magic XXXY had something similar to this though because there was modes where you could kind of touch the girl and if you tried to touch her in a naughty place she'd jump back and get mad at you.
3063529	3065430	Somebody just took this idea in one update.
3065450	3068512	They also mentioned that it's as if you feel the magic, you'll love this.

3081823	3082543	Final thoughts.
3083284	3091470	My final thought is I have to go grocery shopping, and there's no better time to go grocery shopping than one in the morning on a weekend.
3092010	3092411	Good times.
3093298	3095440	I need to buy something.
3095520	3100343	I'm not sure what it is, but I have this urge to buy something, and so I'm thinking it's going to be something game-related.
3100543	3101184	Buy me a car.
3101984	3102084	No.
3103726	3104326	DarkSakura.
3105047	3106648	Reject sexism in video games.
