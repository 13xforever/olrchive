38
00:04:37,771 --> 00:04:39,472
[SPEAKER_09]: I like almond butter and cinnamon bread.

39
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,152
[SPEAKER_09]: It's good stuff.

40
00:04:41,232 --> 00:04:42,452
[SPEAKER_04]: You just made me think of Cinnabon.

41
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:43,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn.

42
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:45,333
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm hungry for Cinnabon right now.

43
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:47,293
[SPEAKER_09]: I found really good cinnamon bread.

44
00:04:48,474 --> 00:04:50,494
[SPEAKER_09]: And I need an Ethernet cable, please.

45
00:04:50,973 --> 00:04:52,934
[SPEAKER_04]: You know why Cinnabon pisses me off, though?

46
00:04:53,855 --> 00:04:55,536
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it smells like crack?

47
00:04:55,897 --> 00:05:07,145
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, because they have one in the mall, and it's like, right fucking by EB Games, so every time I want to go shopping for games, I go, ooh, Cinnamini.

48
00:05:08,846 --> 00:05:09,566
[SPEAKER_04]: So fuck Cinnabon.

49
00:05:09,867 --> 00:05:11,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hi, Loki's here, too.

50
00:05:12,769 --> 00:05:13,709
[SPEAKER_04]: The tech master, Loki.

51
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,491
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I'm here, and...

52
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:19,002
[SPEAKER_03]: I destroy Twinbee with Optimus Prime.

53
00:05:19,722 --> 00:05:21,403
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got to talk about this game later on.

54
00:05:21,443 --> 00:05:22,404
[SPEAKER_04]: That game was the shit.

55
00:05:24,285 --> 00:05:26,567
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll talk about some various stuff tonight.

56
00:05:26,947 --> 00:05:30,069
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, we've got a little bit of Bomani news to talk about.

57
00:05:31,014 --> 00:05:33,175
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if it's so much a little bit, but the V-Rare's out.

58
00:05:34,135 --> 00:05:40,518
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going to play it for you guys tonight, except I couldn't get my hands on it, and I'm going to tell you about what happened there, because it's kind of a funny story.

59
00:05:40,538 --> 00:05:41,218
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll tell you about that.

60
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:44,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's supposed to be getting a copy of it from inside Konami.

61
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,541
[SPEAKER_03]: And also Ultramix 3's V-Rare, which we'll have first, hopefully.

62
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:49,061
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

63
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:49,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully.

64
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:50,482
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy better hurry up.

65
00:05:51,042 --> 00:05:52,723
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel's got to hurry up.

66
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:53,483
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.

67
00:05:55,834 --> 00:05:56,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Bugged!

68
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:21,373
[SPEAKER_22]: I had to finish cracking out on Burnout Legends there

69
00:06:49,898 --> 00:06:51,379
[SPEAKER_04]: Neuropa, because I like Neuropa.

70
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:51,779
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cool.

71
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,800
[SPEAKER_22]: Gee, weren't we listening to Neuropa last night?

72
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,280
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we were.

73
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,122
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to hear them right now with Standing Still in Time.

74
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:58,923

82
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:55,930
[SPEAKER_25]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

83
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,351
[SPEAKER_15]: No!

84
00:13:58,491 --> 00:13:59,151
[SPEAKER_25]: Just kidding.

85
00:13:59,591 --> 00:14:00,632
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:02,313
[SPEAKER_25]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

87
00:14:04,173 --> 00:14:06,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

88
00:14:06,935 --> 00:14:09,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Episode number 155 here in progress.

89
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:10,036
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, that's right.

90
00:14:10,615 --> 00:14:12,275
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actually live tonight.

91
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:13,596
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so freaking excited.

92
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:15,576
[SPEAKER_04]: We were off for a couple weeks there.

93
00:14:15,796 --> 00:14:17,176
[SPEAKER_04]: One week was our choice.

94
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:19,177
[SPEAKER_04]: We were gone for a week because, hey, you know what?

95
00:14:19,197 --> 00:14:20,817
[SPEAKER_04]: We deserve a vacation once in a while.

96
00:14:21,337 --> 00:14:26,319
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, secretly, some things are going on behind the scenes, including Jamie's bachelorette party.

97
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,419
[SPEAKER_04]: It happened to be the same night, but that was cool because I got to go.

98
00:14:29,979 --> 00:14:32,580
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the only guy at Jamie's bachelorette party, but it was fun.

99
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a good time.

100
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,461
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because you're special.

101
00:14:35,661 --> 00:14:37,061
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw Xanadu for the first time.

102
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:42,545
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you need to sit down and watch Xanadu all the way through from beginning to end, because that movie is awesome.

103
00:14:42,585 --> 00:14:43,486
[SPEAKER_09]: Bring earplugs.

104
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:46,247
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I like the music in Xanadu.

105
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:49,029
[SPEAKER_04]: That actually was one of the only things that made it worth it.

106
00:14:49,970 --> 00:14:57,114
[SPEAKER_04]: The interesting thing about Xanadu, and I know a lot of you guys probably only know Xanadu from that song that was in DDR3rdMix.

107
00:14:58,735 --> 00:15:00,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, I'm trying to play a clip here.

108
00:15:00,657 --> 00:15:00,937
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

109
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,302
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first song a lot of people played in DDR.

110
00:15:09,762 --> 00:15:11,863
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it starts with an X. An X is always better.

111
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:13,724
[SPEAKER_04]: No, because it's a one-footer.

112
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:16,285
[SPEAKER_04]: The Olivia Project, queen of the one-footers.

113
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:19,686
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so Xanadu is like this old-ass movie.

114
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:20,447
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, not that old.

115
00:15:20,627 --> 00:15:24,368
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I was alive when it was made, so it can't be that old.

116
00:15:24,388 --> 00:15:24,368
1980.

117
00:15:24,648 --> 00:15:27,849
[SPEAKER_09]: That movie is 25 years old.

118
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:28,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

119
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,530
[SPEAKER_09]: It had Gene Kelly in it.

120
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:34,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so what it was trying to do is trying to be like a throwback to old cinema where they would, you know,

121
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:35,653
[SPEAKER_04]: The Mews

122
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,616
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I'll show you how much I was paying attention to Santa too.

123
00:15:57,656 --> 00:16:00,497
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you came in and did you see the animated part?

124
00:16:00,678 --> 00:16:01,038
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I did.

125
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:02,178
[SPEAKER_09]: I love the animated part.

126
00:16:02,638 --> 00:16:09,541
[SPEAKER_09]: It's Don Bluth Studios and Don Bluth, to give it a video game connection, did Dragon's Lair, Space Days.

127
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:12,703
[SPEAKER_04]: Same guy who did that stuff and Dragon's Lair is awesome.

128
00:16:13,063 --> 00:16:13,343
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

129
00:16:13,543 --> 00:16:24,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though Dragon's Lair was a ridiculously simple and kind of like as a game itself it was kind of stupid, like the interactive cartoon feature of it made it so worth it.

130
00:16:24,648 --> 00:16:26,650
[SPEAKER_04]: The technology at the time was pretty nifty.

131
00:16:26,690 --> 00:16:27,431
[SPEAKER_04]: It was kick-ass.

132
00:16:27,891 --> 00:16:30,813
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, hell, I can sit here and pay a quarter to control a laser disc.

133
00:16:30,853 --> 00:16:31,674
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Rudy Brad.

134
00:16:32,795 --> 00:16:33,436
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, think about it.

135
00:16:33,696 --> 00:16:39,921
[SPEAKER_04]: We never got a perfect copy of Dragon's Lair at home until DVD players.

136
00:16:41,182 --> 00:16:44,765
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you are into the emulation scene, the Daphne emulator.

137
00:16:45,226 --> 00:16:45,866
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, true.

138
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:50,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But I should say a blessed copy of it.

139
00:16:50,931 --> 00:16:51,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Novellma.

140
00:16:52,498 --> 00:16:55,999
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not, oh, Scooby, no.

141
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,079
[SPEAKER_09]: He says Scooby, I think Buffy, so.

142
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,000
[SPEAKER_22]: No.

143
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:01,940
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway.

144
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,801
[SPEAKER_22]: We're the wrong shirt, then.

145
00:17:04,701 --> 00:17:06,882
[SPEAKER_04]: So, okay, so we were off two weeks ago because of that.

146
00:17:06,922 --> 00:17:08,642
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the bachelorette party going on.

147
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:12,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, which, by the way, was one of the more girly things I'd seen in a while.

148
00:17:12,923 --> 00:17:19,985
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, being the gay guy, I got to, you know, got the first look, or got the inside look at what girls really do when they get together.

149
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,071
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

150
00:17:41,577 --> 00:17:44,839
[SPEAKER_22]: I keep mishearing that as Dalzeem from like Street Fighter.

151
00:17:44,859 --> 00:17:45,860
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like, here's a Dalzeem.

152
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:46,600
[SPEAKER_22]: Yoga.

153
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,140
[SPEAKER_22]: Yoga.

154
00:17:47,321 --> 00:17:48,021
[SPEAKER_22]: Yoga fire.

155
00:17:50,262 --> 00:17:50,983
[SPEAKER_22]: Death by yoga.

156
00:17:54,105 --> 00:17:54,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Yoga flame.

157
00:17:55,706 --> 00:17:58,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, last week we were all here.

158
00:17:58,847 --> 00:18:00,748
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a shitload of people in studio too.

159
00:18:00,809 --> 00:18:07,613
[SPEAKER_04]: We had Mikulatov was here, Pixie Dust was here, the Orange Lounge Madam, who hadn't been here in like a year and a half, and her...

160
00:18:08,663 --> 00:18:11,105
[SPEAKER_04]: Fiance now or a long time boyfriend, one of the two.

161
00:18:11,165 --> 00:18:18,150
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, Stylin was here and Mel B was here and we couldn't do a show because... And we were drinking.

162
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:19,211
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were drinking.

163
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:21,133
[SPEAKER_04]: We were quite intoxicated last week.

164
00:18:21,513 --> 00:18:22,514
[SPEAKER_09]: I had three Guinnesses.

165
00:18:23,094 --> 00:18:33,282
[SPEAKER_04]: And Live 365, due to some error after their maintenance window, they do regular maintenance on Saturday nights now, but they did some stupid error afterwards that caused...

166
00:18:34,002 --> 00:18:47,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody on live 365 to be able to carry a live show, which pissed some people off royally because there's some stations out there that run live all the time, which, you know, one day in a more perfect world, I would like to be able to have Orange Lounge live all the time.

167
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:49,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see, you know, something we can look at for 2006.

168
00:18:52,158 --> 00:18:55,421
[SPEAKER_04]: But you kind of piss some people off that they did that.

169
00:18:55,581 --> 00:18:59,485
[SPEAKER_04]: So needless to say, a lot of listeners complain, a lot of broadcasters complain.

170
00:18:59,909 --> 00:19:03,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Live 365 will be very careful about those sorts of things in the future, so we'll see.

171
00:19:04,336 --> 00:19:04,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

172
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:09,364
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're here this week after two weeks of no show.

173
00:19:09,384 --> 00:19:14,052
[SPEAKER_04]: Those of you guys that are members of our LiveJournal community, though, you did get a show last week, so that's all I can say about that.

174
00:19:15,027 --> 00:19:21,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have some people listening for the first time tonight because of our podcast has still been going.

175
00:19:21,873 --> 00:19:30,059
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we did a podcast last week, even though we were slightly intoxicated, which I don't think we really advertised on the podcast that we were drunk when we were doing it, or at least a little buzzed.

176
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:39,807
[SPEAKER_04]: At the beginning, I think we mentioned it, but we didn't really like, we weren't quite vocal about it as we usually are on the live show when we have three hours.

177
00:19:42,358 --> 00:19:43,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that was basically the thing.

178
00:19:44,039 --> 00:19:47,040
[SPEAKER_04]: But we were quite intoxicated doing the show, but I have to hand it to us.

179
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:52,562
[SPEAKER_04]: And listening to the playback of the show, we did a pretty good job, considering how much we'd all had to drink.

180
00:19:54,202 --> 00:19:56,323
[SPEAKER_09]: I was laying down in the chair with a beer in my hand.

181
00:19:56,523 --> 00:19:57,863
[SPEAKER_22]: You left halfway through, too.

182
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:58,604
[SPEAKER_09]: I had to.

183
00:19:58,804 --> 00:19:59,944
[SPEAKER_22]: You guys just let Mel B talk.

184
00:19:59,984 --> 00:20:01,004
[SPEAKER_22]: He sounded pretty damn sober.

185
00:20:01,064 --> 00:20:01,925
[SPEAKER_22]: Mel B was sober.

186
00:20:02,085 --> 00:20:03,985
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that would be why he didn't sound that drunk.

187
00:20:05,766 --> 00:20:06,166
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway.

188
00:20:09,645 --> 00:20:15,027
[SPEAKER_04]: So we did the podcast, and we have new people listening tonight because we have the podcast.

189
00:20:15,387 --> 00:20:23,930
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of folks are saying that they're actually loading up their Live 365 stream in iTunes, especially now because you know iTunes 5 is out and all that stuff, so iTunes is very cool.

190
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,751
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, iTunes is a great program, I use it myself.

191
00:20:26,871 --> 00:20:35,154
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I just want to warn you guys that Orange Sounds Radio is presented in what's called MP3 Pro, and iTunes does not support

192
00:20:37,895 --> 00:20:39,316
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Media Player supports it now.

193
00:20:39,356 --> 00:20:39,736
[SPEAKER_04]: I think so.

194
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:07,563
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, if you want more information on MP3 Pro, you can visit our website.

195
00:21:07,703 --> 00:21:10,926
[SPEAKER_04]: It's at orangehonestradio.com and check the FAQ.

196
00:21:11,246 --> 00:21:19,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, I don't want to discourage you guys from listening in iTunes because we will sound normal through iTunes except we sound a little better with the MP3 Pro codec.

197
00:21:19,353 --> 00:21:26,840
[SPEAKER_04]: It's broadband radio at a dial-up connection because MP3 Pro does something to the header or something where it encodes... It adds 10 years of maturity.

198
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:28,281
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, yeah.

199
00:21:28,401 --> 00:21:29,362
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway.

200
00:21:30,686 --> 00:21:32,887
[SPEAKER_04]: Although I did download iTunes 5, it's kind of cool.

201
00:21:33,147 --> 00:21:40,390
[SPEAKER_04]: The only thing I didn't understand about iTunes 5 is that it really wasn't that much different from 4.9, except for they changed the store a lot.

202
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,030
[SPEAKER_04]: And the look.

203
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:47,893
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit, but the look and feel, it's not like they changed the colors or they changed the way the buttons look or anything.

204
00:21:47,913 --> 00:21:50,514
[SPEAKER_04]: They just kind of changed, well now it's more square instead of rounded.

205
00:21:51,414 --> 00:21:53,075
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it's cool and all.

206
00:21:53,795 --> 00:21:57,376
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't get me wrong, I like iTunes, and iTunes 5 is cool and all, I guess.

207
00:21:57,396 --> 00:22:01,197
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does the Outlook sync, I guess, which is cool if you're into using Outlook, which I don't.

208
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:02,937
[SPEAKER_04]: Outlook sync?

209
00:22:03,758 --> 00:22:06,899
[SPEAKER_04]: It syncs your contacts on your iPod with Microsoft Outlook.

210
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:09,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

211
00:22:09,479 --> 00:22:11,800
[SPEAKER_04]: If that's something that appeals to you, you could go do that.

212
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:12,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

213
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:15,141
[SPEAKER_22]: I use Pine.

214
00:22:15,161 --> 00:22:17,282
[SPEAKER_22]: I use Pine.

215
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:19,262
[SPEAKER_04]: For your email?

216
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,003
[SPEAKER_22]: Pine and Gmail, that's my two...

217
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,724
[SPEAKER_04]: That's pretty hardcore.

218
00:22:24,749 --> 00:22:24,789
[SPEAKER_04]: Um...

219
00:22:26,065 --> 00:22:29,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Listeners in the chat room, blah, blah, blah, listening to some comments here.

220
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,868
[SPEAKER_04]: LIA365 needs to support AAC.

221
00:22:32,589 --> 00:22:37,992
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not the first person to suggest that, and some folks have actually suggested that to LIA365 directly.

222
00:22:38,892 --> 00:22:41,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be kind of cool because I think AAC has better encryption.

223
00:22:41,574 --> 00:22:45,356
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what else has really good encryption is OGG, and I'd like to see LIA365 support it.

224
00:22:45,376 --> 00:22:46,296
[SPEAKER_04]: Encryption or compression?

225
00:22:46,456 --> 00:22:46,877
[SPEAKER_04]: Compression.

226
00:22:46,897 --> 00:22:47,457
[SPEAKER_04]: What am I saying?

227
00:22:47,477 --> 00:22:48,978
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just said OGG.

228
00:22:49,398 --> 00:22:50,298
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone just said OGG?

229
00:22:50,679 --> 00:22:51,139
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there it is.

230
00:22:51,319 --> 00:22:51,499
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

231
00:22:51,999 --> 00:22:52,400
[SPEAKER_04]: OGG.

232
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,020
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

233
00:22:54,102 --> 00:22:58,104
[SPEAKER_04]: And there has been talk amongst, you know, are we going to stay with Live 365?

234
00:22:58,144 --> 00:22:59,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we not going to stay with Live 365?

235
00:22:59,705 --> 00:23:06,248
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem, well, I guess I should say, Live 365, up until last week, has actually been pretty damn good.

236
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:07,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't complain a whole lot.

237
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:09,669
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got nice people running it, too.

238
00:23:09,950 --> 00:23:13,711
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact we've gone to their awards ceremony two years in a row and didn't win crap.

239
00:23:14,051 --> 00:23:14,872
[SPEAKER_04]: And had to pay.

240
00:23:14,892 --> 00:23:15,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and had to pay.

241
00:23:15,772 --> 00:23:16,773
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a pretty decent time.

242
00:23:16,993 --> 00:23:19,034
[SPEAKER_04]: Betty's really nice, and she's like, you know, kind of... I win crap.

243
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:20,420
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, that's right.

244
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,882
[SPEAKER_04]: We won the remote control a couple years ago.

245
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,504
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, and I won speakers by playing bingo.

246
00:23:26,524 --> 00:23:27,365
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you actually get them?

247
00:23:27,765 --> 00:23:28,005
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

248
00:23:28,225 --> 00:23:28,565
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

249
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:31,187
[SPEAKER_04]: I walked out with that Humongoid box, remember?

250
00:23:31,267 --> 00:23:32,228
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, that's right.

251
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:37,972
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually got to take the speakers because you had come in from a long ways out of town, whereas the other folks had to have it shipped to them.

252
00:23:38,092 --> 00:23:43,997
[SPEAKER_09]: And the speakers are now hooked up to my PC, where they were probably on display at GameStop on Fulton and Marconi.

253
00:23:44,617 --> 00:23:45,498
[SPEAKER_04]: Right on, right on.

254
00:23:46,398 --> 00:23:48,540
[SPEAKER_04]: So, anyway...

255
00:23:50,435 --> 00:24:19,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Life 365 pays the licensing for songs that we play and although we've kind of had discussions on staff whereas you know is the video game music really it's kind of in a gray area you know I don't think we really need to pay licensing on it we don't really know we do play a lot of other music in our pre-show on Tuesday night show on the cage match that is ASCAP BMI all that stuff licensed and so Life 365 pays our licensing fees for that so we're all legit we're legal we're

256
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:20,156
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

257
00:24:49,702 --> 00:24:50,743
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been listening to you guys.

258
00:24:51,023 --> 00:24:55,187
[SPEAKER_04]: We've thought about the switch up too, but those are kind of the reasons why we hesitate a little bit.

259
00:24:57,168 --> 00:24:57,429
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

260
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:03,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And now there's a whole lot of other suggestions there in the chat room, which is kind of cool.

261
00:25:04,174 --> 00:25:05,135
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to mods.

262
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:06,596
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of mods?

263
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:08,898
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like MOD format?

264
00:25:09,438 --> 00:25:12,421
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, there used to be some kickass stuff in MOD format.

265
00:25:12,461 --> 00:25:14,603
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't stream that stuff.

266
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:14,863
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

267
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:15,784
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

268
00:25:17,076 --> 00:25:18,457
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

269
00:25:45,489 --> 00:25:56,637
[SPEAKER_09]: congratulations dot dot dot yeah I got married it was pretty cool um yeah nothing's really different um but uh

270
00:25:59,227 --> 00:26:00,647
[SPEAKER_09]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

271
00:26:22,958 --> 00:26:27,220
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's still 2DX in full arcade mode widescreen on a 50-inch TV.

272
00:26:27,260 --> 00:26:27,640
[SPEAKER_04]: It was hot.

273
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,261
[SPEAKER_09]: That was like hoo-hoo in those red couches.

274
00:26:30,561 --> 00:26:32,442
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy playing 2DX on my 30-inch widescreen.

275
00:26:32,462 --> 00:26:33,922
[SPEAKER_04]: 50-inch was very nice.

276
00:26:34,262 --> 00:26:35,663
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

277
00:26:37,303 --> 00:26:41,145
[SPEAKER_09]: And, you know, I've played, you know, it's more been a little bit of this and that.

278
00:26:41,165 --> 00:26:44,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I've just been really busy between getting married and going to school.

279
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:46,547
[SPEAKER_09]: Haven't had too much time for much else.

280
00:26:47,727 --> 00:26:49,408
[SPEAKER_09]: And that, and I think I have a sinus infection.

281
00:26:50,950 --> 00:26:51,751
[SPEAKER_04]: What shitty timing.

282
00:26:52,131 --> 00:26:52,892
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, seriously.

283
00:26:53,192 --> 00:26:56,275
[SPEAKER_09]: Especially since I'm, you know, busy all the time now.

284
00:26:56,955 --> 00:26:57,896
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's going to get worse.

285
00:26:58,737 --> 00:27:01,119
[SPEAKER_09]: Because two more classes come up in October.

286
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,762
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm going to be back to doing homework all the time.

287
00:27:07,505 --> 00:27:08,906
[SPEAKER_09]: At least I can take my puppies to work.

288
00:27:09,947 --> 00:27:13,930
[SPEAKER_09]: I go out on break and feed my puppies during my break at work.

289
00:27:14,371 --> 00:27:14,631
[SPEAKER_09]: Addict.

290
00:27:15,912 --> 00:27:17,954
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, so I don't want them to run away.

291
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:28,186
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm saving it for the, trying to get the, what was it, 5 million saved up so I can buy the house, the Japanese style house in my game.

292
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:29,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's just 5,000.

293
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:29,386
5,000?

294
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,366
[SPEAKER_04]: 5 million's a little hard to come by in my game.

295
00:27:31,626 --> 00:27:32,867
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright, well, then I'm halfway there.

296
00:27:33,867 --> 00:27:34,247
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

297
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:37,228
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah.

298
00:27:38,208 --> 00:27:38,588
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it?

299
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:44,550
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, not really, well, yeah, there's a, what I'm doing, uh,

300
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,052
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if people were listening.

301
00:27:49,072 --> 00:27:56,254
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a pretty decent tune in for it, but on the first, I did the premiere, not the first, why am I saying the first?

302
00:27:57,094 --> 00:28:00,455
[SPEAKER_09]: A few weeks ago, I did the premiere for the Blood and Synth album on Pump Up the Volume.

303
00:28:00,875 --> 00:28:02,175
[SPEAKER_09]: That had a pretty good reaction.

304
00:28:06,497 --> 00:28:13,499
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been trying to do what I can to play some of that on my station, on my show.

305
00:28:13,639 --> 00:28:15,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Helping promote the indie labels.

306
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:15,619
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.

307
00:28:16,059 --> 00:28:16,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Doing our part.

308
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:18,821
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's also part of what we do.

309
00:28:18,981 --> 00:28:22,223
[SPEAKER_09]: We try to get the new and the neat out there.

310
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:27,407
[SPEAKER_09]: But I really haven't had too much free time otherwise.

311
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:28,928
[SPEAKER_09]: Working on it!

312
00:28:29,808 --> 00:28:31,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, well I hope you get some free time pretty soon.

313
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:34,231
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I've also been working on stuff for a shaft too.

314
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:36,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, the tournament!

315
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

316
00:28:38,242 --> 00:28:42,927
[SPEAKER_09]: Tentative date around November 17th when the DDR Xbox releases.

317
00:28:42,987 --> 00:28:45,910
[SPEAKER_04]: Or for some of us on staff, Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.

318
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:46,871
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

319
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:52,156
[SPEAKER_09]: There's that, but we're working on a GameStop sponsorship right now.

320
00:28:52,296 --> 00:28:52,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

321
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,882
[SPEAKER_04]: And we might have sponsorship from the Big K, too, right?

322
00:28:58,082 --> 00:28:58,543
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

323
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,082
[SPEAKER_04]: So more details coming on that.

324
00:29:01,123 --> 00:29:04,466
[SPEAKER_04]: So DER tournaments not dead yet because we're going to throw a hell of a party.

325
00:29:04,586 --> 00:29:04,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?

326
00:29:04,927 --> 00:29:10,072
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we're the ones planning it here at Orange Lounge Radio with some help from our buddies in Sacramento.

327
00:29:10,152 --> 00:29:10,793
[SPEAKER_04]: And bowling.

328
00:29:11,482 --> 00:29:12,483
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

329
00:29:37,833 --> 00:29:40,295
[SPEAKER_09]: and we got up there and did Afranova in costume.

330
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:41,075
[SPEAKER_09]: That was pretty rad.

331
00:29:43,817 --> 00:29:47,360
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was... Somebody was Devil Zuken.

332
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,960
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember that.

333
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:48,660
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.

334
00:29:49,201 --> 00:29:56,346
[SPEAKER_09]: We had... That was actually one of our... One of the old GameStop... Golfland regulars.

335
00:29:59,368 --> 00:30:05,832
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we had the Twinkie one where we had the Beatmania contest with it too.

336
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:17,918
[SPEAKER_04]: and this year it's going to be DDR and Bowling very cool you know right now there's a whole lot of In The Groove tournaments going on because they're doing like a national thing for In The Groove

337
00:30:19,242 --> 00:30:23,206
[SPEAKER_04]: and various, I have to be honest, I haven't read up on it because I don't think they're doing one here in Sacramento.

338
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:25,408
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they're going to do one at Miggle for kind of like NorCal.

339
00:30:25,568 --> 00:30:31,293
[SPEAKER_09]: From what I understand, there's actually been, it's officially by, what's the point called now?

340
00:30:31,953 --> 00:30:32,554
[SPEAKER_09]: Paradise Island?

341
00:30:32,574 --> 00:30:33,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Paradise Island.

342
00:30:33,595 --> 00:30:38,039
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that they have put a stop on any In The Groove tournaments until...

343
00:30:38,439 --> 00:30:44,981
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we heard, something about Sacramento locally, and I wish Explicit was here because he'd know more of the details on what's going on because he works there at Paradise Island.

344
00:30:45,862 --> 00:30:55,465
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently what went on is that folks are using the old fish and wire trick where they put the fish, not that I'm telling you how to get free credits, don't do this or we'll come find you and beat you up.

345
00:30:56,045 --> 00:30:56,545
[SPEAKER_04]: www.DarkSakura.com

346
00:31:18,114 --> 00:31:19,735
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to know about what you beat off at home.

347
00:31:19,755 --> 00:31:22,917
[SPEAKER_04]: My cabinet, duh.

348
00:31:25,959 --> 00:31:27,300
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta play Miss World Nude.

349
00:31:27,340 --> 00:31:28,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotta, gotta, gotta.

350
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:33,424
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the luxury of being able to map coin buttons to any of the buttons on the thing.

351
00:31:34,845 --> 00:31:41,589
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got our coin thing hooked up on ours, so we just hit the player one button continuously because it's on free play.

352
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:49,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, so don't steal credits because then the arcade operators don't make money and then they decide to get rid of their DDR machines and then you wonder why DDR is dying.

353
00:31:50,571 --> 00:31:51,711
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I did play something else.

354
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:52,112
[SPEAKER_09]: What?

355
00:31:52,532 --> 00:31:53,452
[SPEAKER_09]: Arcade P.O.P.O.

356
00:31:54,452 --> 00:31:54,873
[SPEAKER_09]: on the name.

357
00:31:56,493 --> 00:31:56,893
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.

358
00:31:57,153 --> 00:31:58,154
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I did play something else.

359
00:31:58,174 --> 00:31:58,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Something fun.

360
00:31:59,294 --> 00:32:00,494
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, Loki, how was your week?

361
00:32:00,515 --> 00:32:00,915
[SPEAKER_04]: How was your day?

362
00:32:02,335 --> 00:32:07,517
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think, I can't remember, I think the last time we had a show was before the whole

363
00:32:08,188 --> 00:32:37,072
[SPEAKER_03]: GameCompanies came out to our work and that was fun because I got to meet with everybody and I got to talk to the guy Xeroff at Konami and we found out things and he's hooking me up with stuff supposedly the VRares but he's been busy because he has to travel around and stuff to talk to other distributors and companies about their games and he just didn't get a chance to send it yet but soon he promised me he'll send it so

364
00:32:38,188 --> 00:32:38,868
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to wait for that.

365
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:47,994
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the Tomo guy, who, um, they're the company that's behind the Agetech products, so, um, he's gonna send me some stuff, hopefully.

366
00:32:49,215 --> 00:32:54,198
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, we just, you know, EA, Microsoft, Ubisoft, just everybody.

367
00:32:54,318 --> 00:32:58,961
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw all their lineup and everything, it's fucking awesome, and got to find out about the Xbox 360, and...

368
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:02,023
[SPEAKER_03]: All that fun stuff.

369
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,585
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyways, we did that.

370
00:33:03,805 --> 00:33:08,770
[SPEAKER_03]: I got lots of free games, which I then sold to GameStop to put towards my 360.

371
00:33:09,470 --> 00:33:11,172
[SPEAKER_03]: So I now have $250 towards my 360.

372
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:16,898
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, what else?

373
00:33:17,118 --> 00:33:18,139
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, let's see.

374
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, relatives came up and hung out with them.

375
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,005
[SPEAKER_03]: They barbecued for me.

376
00:33:24,685 --> 00:33:24,825
[SPEAKER_03]: And...

377
00:33:29,239 --> 00:33:37,842
[SPEAKER_03]: I found an ISO for Burnout Legends, so I've been playing that on my PSP because it's awesome.

378
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:42,083
[SPEAKER_03]: Just the kill time until I get Burnout Revenge, which is coming out next Wednesday.

379
00:33:42,703 --> 00:33:45,504
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, I can't wait for that.

380
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:48,585
[SPEAKER_03]: I already have it paid for, it's reserved, I just have to go pick it up.

381
00:33:50,266 --> 00:33:51,146
[SPEAKER_03]: Lots of fun stuff.

382
00:33:51,806 --> 00:33:53,667
[SPEAKER_03]: And, yeah, that's pretty much it.

383
00:33:56,048 --> 00:33:56,348
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

384
00:33:57,318 --> 00:34:00,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Neil, would you care to share with us how your week and your day has been?

385
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, remember we saw the strangest thing at Fry's yesterday?

386
00:34:03,102 --> 00:34:04,062
[SPEAKER_22]: Looking through the DS games?

387
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:05,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, what the hell?

388
00:34:05,823 --> 00:34:08,325
[SPEAKER_04]: Fry's is carrying import DS games now?

389
00:34:09,065 --> 00:34:09,986
[SPEAKER_22]: Might just be the Bay Area.

390
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:12,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, well, I think probably just that one.

391
00:34:13,008 --> 00:34:14,469
[SPEAKER_04]: But very interesting.

392
00:34:14,509 --> 00:34:17,231
[SPEAKER_04]: But they're not carrying anything super special.

393
00:34:17,491 --> 00:34:22,594
[SPEAKER_04]: They had an import pool game, like Billiards Pool, and an import Mahjong game.

394
00:34:23,274 --> 00:34:23,635
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.

395
00:34:24,895 --> 00:34:25,836
[SPEAKER_22]: That's all we saw, at least.

396
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:26,989
[SPEAKER_04]: At least that's all we found.

397
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:30,271
[SPEAKER_04]: But no import copies of Nintendogs or games have been out here yet.

398
00:34:30,291 --> 00:34:33,353
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because like the Game Boy Advance, there's no region coding on them.

399
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:39,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is interesting that a major retailer such as Fry's, which I know is only on the West Coast mostly.

400
00:34:41,177 --> 00:34:42,237
[SPEAKER_22]: They're sneaking out to the East.

401
00:34:42,337 --> 00:34:42,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they now?

402
00:34:42,838 --> 00:34:45,719
[SPEAKER_22]: They're in Georgia, Illinois, and Indiana now.

403
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:49,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, Outpost.com too is the national site for Fry's.

404
00:34:50,021 --> 00:34:52,843
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're carrying at least that one store.

405
00:34:53,894 --> 00:34:55,015
[SPEAKER_04]: Some import DS games.

406
00:34:55,215 --> 00:34:56,356
[SPEAKER_22]: Fremont for those in the Bay Area.

407
00:34:58,018 --> 00:34:58,638
[SPEAKER_22]: What have I been playing?

408
00:34:58,658 --> 00:35:00,179
[SPEAKER_22]: I've been playing, well, guess what?

409
00:35:00,219 --> 00:35:00,860
[SPEAKER_22]: Burnout 3.

410
00:35:02,261 --> 00:35:05,524
[SPEAKER_22]: And yes, I'm also looking forward to Burnout 4.

411
00:35:07,085 --> 00:35:10,628
[SPEAKER_22]: I guess I'm going to go put Flat Out, sell back Flat Out and put that down on it.

412
00:35:11,008 --> 00:35:13,170
[SPEAKER_22]: Because I did not like Flat Out.

413
00:35:14,031 --> 00:35:19,696
[SPEAKER_22]: Compared to Burnout, it sucked.

414
00:35:19,996 --> 00:35:22,158
[SPEAKER_22]: Diablo 2, and I've been playing drinking games.

415
00:35:23,708 --> 00:35:26,269
[SPEAKER_22]: Is Diablo 2 still really popular on the internet?

416
00:35:26,449 --> 00:35:27,209
[SPEAKER_22]: Apparently so.

417
00:35:27,269 --> 00:35:29,630
[SPEAKER_04]: The servers are still pretty damn full.

418
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:32,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Diablo 2 is like 10 years old.

419
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:35,232
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out in 2000.

420
00:35:35,272 --> 00:35:35,572
[SPEAKER_04]: 2005 years old.

421
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,092
[SPEAKER_04]: That's still a long life for a computer game.

422
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,673
[SPEAKER_04]: They just put out a patch for it last month.

423
00:35:38,893 --> 00:35:39,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.

424
00:35:39,653 --> 00:35:40,133
[SPEAKER_04]: It's up to 1.11.

425
00:35:40,173 --> 00:35:42,414
[SPEAKER_04]: And are people still playing it?

426
00:35:42,734 --> 00:35:45,895
[SPEAKER_04]: I played Diablo 2 for like a month and I just suck at it.

427
00:35:47,295 --> 00:35:48,556
[SPEAKER_22]: I just keep making more characters.

428
00:35:48,936 --> 00:35:52,357
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm trying to come up with more creative names like Itchy, Scratchy,

429
00:35:53,361 --> 00:36:00,507
[SPEAKER_22]: Bernie, and other nicely descriptive ones, Deadly, stuff like that.

430
00:36:01,187 --> 00:36:11,034
[SPEAKER_22]: And as for the drinking game, it's been going around all the breweries and getting a full sampler and seeing which of their beers really suck, and sliding them back and forth until somebody says, oh, fuck it, and just drinks it.

431
00:36:11,295 --> 00:36:12,756
[SPEAKER_04]: Best brewery you've been to?

432
00:36:14,117 --> 00:36:14,837
[SPEAKER_22]: Sudwork, by far.

433
00:36:15,338 --> 00:36:15,818
[SPEAKER_04]: Sudworks.

434
00:36:16,246 --> 00:36:16,586
[SPEAKER_22]: Subwork.

435
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:18,327
[SPEAKER_22]: No S, just Subwork.

436
00:36:18,687 --> 00:36:19,067
[SPEAKER_04]: Subwork.

437
00:36:19,988 --> 00:36:21,929
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, is that just because it's the local one near you?

438
00:36:22,129 --> 00:36:24,290
[SPEAKER_22]: That's because it's the one I can stumble to, yeah.

439
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,492
[SPEAKER_22]: All I have to do is be able to stumble back across train tracks, and I'm set.

440
00:36:29,032 --> 00:36:29,292
[SPEAKER_22]: All right.

441
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:35,315
[SPEAKER_22]: But other than that, Gordon Biersch down in the Bay Area, and Pyramid Brewery, which is kind of a national...

442
00:36:35,991 --> 00:36:39,513
[SPEAKER_22]: But this week I went to BJ's, which is kind of a pizza and a brewery place.

443
00:36:40,033 --> 00:36:41,394
[SPEAKER_22]: Isn't that like a chain of restaurants?

444
00:36:41,494 --> 00:36:41,954
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a chain.

445
00:36:42,154 --> 00:36:43,394
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a national chain.

446
00:36:43,454 --> 00:36:44,175
[SPEAKER_04]: They just built one.

447
00:36:44,975 --> 00:36:46,916
[SPEAKER_04]: They've built two here in Northern California now, I think.

448
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:48,457
[SPEAKER_22]: The one in San Jose does not have a brewery.

449
00:36:49,017 --> 00:36:49,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

450
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:50,838
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one in Folsom.

451
00:36:51,498 --> 00:36:51,878
[SPEAKER_22]: Is there now?

452
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:52,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

453
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:53,359
[SPEAKER_04]: They just built one up there.

454
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it wasn't on their website.

455
00:36:54,339 --> 00:36:55,180
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's one in Roseville.

456
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,640
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I went to the one in Roseville.

457
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:56,961
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

458
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:00,682
[SPEAKER_22]: And then I went out to Lincoln to Beerman's and it was all bad.

459
00:37:00,862 --> 00:37:02,403
[SPEAKER_22]: It didn't have enough taste to be real beer.

460
00:37:04,339 --> 00:37:05,919
[SPEAKER_22]: It's pretty bad, I'm turning into a beer connoisseur.

461
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:08,900
[SPEAKER_09]: Last night was beer night.

462
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,320
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh yeah, I did forget to mention that.

463
00:37:12,721 --> 00:37:16,982
[SPEAKER_09]: Last night was our friend wedding reception at Dave & Buster's.

464
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:18,962
[SPEAKER_09]: So I did actually play more games last night.

465
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,482
[SPEAKER_22]: Where I went through 50 ounces of beer in 10 minutes.

466
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:25,103
[SPEAKER_09]: I went through 50 ounces of beer in several segments.

467
00:37:26,063 --> 00:37:27,403
[SPEAKER_09]: I had Guinness and a Black & Tan.

468
00:37:27,523 --> 00:37:29,084
[SPEAKER_22]: And played Battletech.

469
00:37:31,852 --> 00:37:32,512
[SPEAKER_22]: You know what I found?

470
00:37:32,612 --> 00:37:37,015
[SPEAKER_22]: The eight-player, what is that, Daytona USA?

471
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:38,095
[SPEAKER_22]: They don't have drink holders.

472
00:37:38,115 --> 00:37:39,496
[SPEAKER_22]: You can't drink and drive.

473
00:37:40,516 --> 00:37:40,917
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn it.

474
00:37:41,537 --> 00:37:41,997
[SPEAKER_22]: It sucks.

475
00:37:42,037 --> 00:37:45,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Most of the other driving games do have cup holders so you can put down your giant beer and drive.

476
00:37:45,859 --> 00:37:48,100
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what's sad about that Daytona setup, though?

477
00:37:48,941 --> 00:37:57,805
[SPEAKER_09]: I played the first one when it was completely brand new, debuted in Vegas when I was in 11th grade, which was in 90... A while ago.

478
00:37:58,706 --> 00:37:58,926
[SPEAKER_09]: ...two.

479
00:38:00,393 --> 00:38:00,693
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow.

480
00:38:01,774 --> 00:38:02,074
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

481
00:38:02,915 --> 00:38:04,996
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you couldn't have been in 11th grade in 92.

482
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:06,397
[SPEAKER_09]: I graduated in 94.

483
00:38:06,437 --> 00:38:07,298
[SPEAKER_09]: Holy crap.

484
00:38:07,318 --> 00:38:07,958
[SPEAKER_09]: You're older than us.

485
00:38:08,999 --> 00:38:09,899
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I'm 29.

486
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:14,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I graduated junior high in 92, but I guess that makes sense because I would have started 9th grade in 92.

487
00:38:15,023 --> 00:38:16,624
[SPEAKER_22]: Hey, amazingly enough, I did too.

488
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:21,687
[SPEAKER_04]: Just for those who don't know, I've known Bugs since like 7th grade.

489
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:22,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost said 4th grade.

490
00:38:22,988 --> 00:38:23,369
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why.

491
00:38:23,389 --> 00:38:23,889
[SPEAKER_04]: 7th grade.

492
00:38:23,949 --> 00:38:26,771
[SPEAKER_22]: And I ran into somebody at Dave & Buster's last night that I met in

493
00:38:27,435 --> 00:38:29,936
[SPEAKER_22]: I have a friend of mine who I just talked to last night.

494
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,416
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, finish your guys' story, then I'll do my side note.

495
00:38:33,236 --> 00:38:37,417
[SPEAKER_22]: We were looking at your picture and laughing.

496
00:38:37,537 --> 00:38:37,697
[SPEAKER_22]: Shut up.

497
00:38:57,011 --> 00:38:57,791
[SPEAKER_22]: We need to scan that.

498
00:38:57,811 --> 00:39:05,495
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry for interjecting again, but the other game I played was, uh, Midnight, uh, was, uh, Langan Midnight, um, Maximum Tune.

499
00:39:05,915 --> 00:39:07,035
[SPEAKER_09]: And I kicked Dan's ass.

500
00:39:07,075 --> 00:39:07,676
[SPEAKER_09]: It was great.

501
00:39:08,896 --> 00:39:11,297
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't he a really big Initial D fan, too?

502
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:11,657
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

503
00:39:11,757 --> 00:39:13,158
[SPEAKER_04]: That's quite an accomplishment.

504
00:39:13,218 --> 00:39:22,682
[SPEAKER_09]: He picked an Evo 8 with the, with the, uh, the MR, with the 6th speed transmission, and I did the MR in automatic just because I hate having to deal with it, and I still won.

505
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:24,023
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, I'm done.

506
00:39:24,423 --> 00:39:24,603
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

507
00:39:26,467 --> 00:39:30,910
[SPEAKER_04]: I had 6,667 coupons on my card last night at one point.

508
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,452
[SPEAKER_22]: Jeez, I only got 1,900.

509
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,935
[SPEAKER_04]: I've bought very few things from the little Dave & Buster's redemption store.

510
00:39:38,155 --> 00:39:39,836
[SPEAKER_04]: And I still haven't gone through those pixie sticks.

511
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:47,101
[SPEAKER_04]: For those of you guys who have never been to Dave & Buster's before, it's like Chuck E. Cheese or like an arcade with pizza type thing.

512
00:39:47,241 --> 00:39:49,163
[SPEAKER_22]: Chuck E. Cheese, an arcade, pizza, and a bar.

513
00:39:49,812 --> 00:39:50,774
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but for adults.

514
00:39:51,175 --> 00:39:53,000
[SPEAKER_04]: And they kick kids out at some point, right?

515
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:53,842
[SPEAKER_22]: Like after 10 o'clock?

516
00:39:55,285 --> 00:39:56,889
[SPEAKER_22]: At any time, they have to be accompanied by an adult.

517
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:57,350
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

518
00:39:58,112 --> 00:39:59,075
[SPEAKER_22]: And they usually aren't, which...

519
00:39:59,795 --> 00:40:02,996
[SPEAKER_22]: Although oftentimes they are, that's why you're not tripping over kids all the time.

520
00:40:03,056 --> 00:40:10,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which is nice, because you don't have little kids running around screaming so much, and little kids in there thinking they own the place and stuff, because their parents have to be with them.

521
00:40:10,217 --> 00:40:15,478
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, just think, little kids plus big drunken people don't really mix well, because big drunken people can punt little kids.

522
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:20,679
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's so nice that you can be there and game with other adults.

523
00:40:21,099 --> 00:40:26,240
[SPEAKER_04]: And although it's kind of cheesy, because half their games are ticket games, just like a normal arcade, but they're so much fun.

524
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:29,021
[SPEAKER_04]: They had a pachinko type one, but they got rid of that.

525
00:40:29,181 --> 00:40:32,003
[SPEAKER_04]: And they got rid of the other one because it broke to the point they couldn't fix it.

526
00:40:32,043 --> 00:40:34,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the golden temple one.

527
00:40:34,285 --> 00:40:35,766
[SPEAKER_09]: The one where you push all the money off.

528
00:40:35,866 --> 00:40:38,689
[SPEAKER_04]: However... Did they have the flaming finger still?

529
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:39,709
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, flaming finger still.

530
00:40:39,809 --> 00:40:42,091
[SPEAKER_04]: I won flaming finger jackpot, first try.

531
00:40:43,612 --> 00:40:47,556
[SPEAKER_04]: Flaming finger is this game that you control with your finger on like this giant touch board.

532
00:40:47,576 --> 00:40:49,297
[SPEAKER_09]: The countdown speeds up the further you get up there.

533
00:40:49,317 --> 00:40:49,977
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it does, it does.

534
00:40:50,178 --> 00:40:53,120
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to move your finger through the maze as fast as you can to win the jackpot.

535
00:40:53,803 --> 00:40:54,983
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

536
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:21,676
[SPEAKER_04]: but they have Exceed 2, Pump It Up Exceed 2 over at Dave Buster's.

537
00:41:21,696 --> 00:41:22,716
[SPEAKER_04]: That doesn't make it any better.

538
00:41:23,317 --> 00:41:24,497
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's cool.

539
00:41:24,717 --> 00:41:26,678
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually starting to like Pump It Up.

540
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:29,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn him for making me like Pump It Up.

541
00:41:29,619 --> 00:41:41,483
[SPEAKER_04]: But between the home release, which I'll talk about after the break, the home release and this recent arcade release, as much as I still hate Pump's interface, I'm really starting to like Pump a lot more, which is kind of scary.

542
00:41:42,664 --> 00:41:43,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you really Rob?

543
00:41:43,864 --> 00:41:45,225
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, I don't know what happened.

544
00:41:45,245 --> 00:41:46,285
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a pod, Rob.

545
00:41:47,082 --> 00:41:51,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Rob did show me earlier, though, another reason why The Groove sucks, and I thank him for that.

546
00:41:53,383 --> 00:41:54,563
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, we were playing.

547
00:41:55,324 --> 00:42:00,865
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki brought over some games tonight, or should I say he just brought over his PS2 hard drive, which is loaded with games.

548
00:42:01,285 --> 00:42:08,766
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm looking at his list of games, and you know how when you load a game onto the HD loader, for those of you guys that have seen it, you can write in whatever the game is called.

549
00:42:09,266 --> 00:42:13,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, he wrote in, in The Groove, parentheses, this game sucks.

550
00:42:14,090 --> 00:42:16,111
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network, Drew, Carameldansen

551
00:42:44,210 --> 00:42:51,228
[SPEAKER_04]: So we played Torn, and that's the one that goes, you know, I'm cold and I am shamed, lying naked on the floor.

552
00:42:51,268 --> 00:42:53,313
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how the lyrics go, but they did...

553
00:42:53,993 --> 00:42:57,056
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm cold and I am shamed, lying on the floor.

554
00:43:14,926 --> 00:43:15,867
[SPEAKER_04]: InTheGroove Mormon Edition

555
00:43:39,926 --> 00:43:40,927
[SPEAKER_04]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

556
00:44:07,721 --> 00:44:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what they're doing in this game.

557
00:44:09,903 --> 00:44:11,484
[SPEAKER_04]: They're cutting out the salt.

558
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,546
[SPEAKER_04]: I can imagine the Loki would be just the movies.

559
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:21,792
[SPEAKER_09]: The first time I saw that movie was off of a pirated copy from the Oscars that they gave the Oscars panel to watch.

560
00:44:23,073 --> 00:44:26,115
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is how I had it on VHS about six months early.

561
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:34,181
[SPEAKER_03]: The first time I saw that movie was on HBO and it was such a bad movie we couldn't get up to turn it off because we had no will to live anymore.

562
00:44:34,862 --> 00:44:36,003
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we decided that we were like,

563
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:38,952
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody get up and stop it, please!

564
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:41,033
[SPEAKER_02]: The end was pretty cool, with the boat.

565
00:44:41,414 --> 00:44:46,838
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the only reason I like this movie is because Leonardo DiCaprio died.

566
00:44:47,459 --> 00:44:48,820
[SPEAKER_03]: And he died a horrible death.

567
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,601
[SPEAKER_09]: You know what, you can see his thumb break off.

568
00:44:51,602 --> 00:44:56,666
[SPEAKER_09]: When she's letting go, and he's falling into the water, his thumb is still attached to the piece of driftwood.

569
00:44:57,207 --> 00:44:58,047
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's cool.

570
00:44:58,127 --> 00:44:58,928
[SPEAKER_09]: That was really cool.

571
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:03,392
[SPEAKER_22]: I still have, as I said, I haven't seen it, and...

572
00:45:04,388 --> 00:45:05,588
[SPEAKER_22]: I already know how the movie's going to end.

573
00:45:05,608 --> 00:45:06,428
[SPEAKER_22]: Why would I want to see it?

574
00:45:06,468 --> 00:45:07,529
[SPEAKER_22]: The boat fucking sinks!

575
00:45:08,669 --> 00:45:10,869
[SPEAKER_22]: How can you make a three-hour movie about something you already know of?

576
00:45:11,729 --> 00:45:13,770
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, then there's like JFK, Nixon.

577
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:18,211
[SPEAKER_22]: And I know people who worked on it.

578
00:45:18,291 --> 00:45:21,831
[SPEAKER_04]: DiCaprio dies, the boat sinks, the old lady had the jewel the whole time.

579
00:45:21,911 --> 00:45:24,272
[SPEAKER_04]: There, I just saved you three hours of pain.

580
00:45:24,572 --> 00:45:26,632
[SPEAKER_04]: You can thank me via email.

581
00:45:26,772 --> 00:45:29,953
[SPEAKER_03]: The ending of The Passion of the Christ totally came at me as a surprise.

582
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:34,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not expect... You know what?

583
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:36,057
[SPEAKER_09]: I really liked the book a lot better.

584
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:41,199
[SPEAKER_22]: Wasn't Passion of the Crest where they break out in song and dance at the end?

585
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,439
[SPEAKER_22]: Or am I thinking of a Mel Brooks movie again?

586
00:45:43,860 --> 00:45:44,380
[SPEAKER_22]: I think you are.

587
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,480
[SPEAKER_09]: By the way, I have a dilemma.

588
00:45:47,701 --> 00:45:47,941
[SPEAKER_22]: What?

589
00:45:48,201 --> 00:45:48,801
[SPEAKER_22]: Jesus Christ.

590
00:45:49,481 --> 00:45:49,941
[SPEAKER_22]: November.

591
00:45:50,621 --> 00:45:50,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

592
00:45:50,941 --> 00:45:52,742
[SPEAKER_09]: Depeche Mode concert or Bill Ingvall?

593
00:45:54,022 --> 00:45:54,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Depeche Mode.

594
00:45:55,263 --> 00:45:55,743
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way.

595
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:56,583
[SPEAKER_04]: All the way.

596
00:45:57,183 --> 00:45:59,144
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still debating because I don't like concerts.

597
00:45:59,404 --> 00:46:00,224
[SPEAKER_04]: Bill Ingvall's

598
00:46:01,121 --> 00:46:01,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that funny to me.

599
00:46:01,921 --> 00:46:02,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he is.

600
00:46:03,462 --> 00:46:04,682
[SPEAKER_04]: Then again, where am I from?

601
00:46:04,842 --> 00:46:11,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Alabama, so they actually watch Blue Collar Comedy Tour or whatever down there, I guess, but not in my house.

602
00:46:12,605 --> 00:46:14,086
[SPEAKER_09]: Bill Engvall is funny.

603
00:46:14,106 --> 00:46:15,787
[SPEAKER_09]: Have you listened to any of his stuff all the way through?

604
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:19,008
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually had to watch one of the episodes of that show once.

605
00:46:19,188 --> 00:46:20,328
[SPEAKER_04]: They all do a little stand-up in it.

606
00:46:20,648 --> 00:46:25,190
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to bring over my friend Julie's DVD, and you're going to watch it with me.

607
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:27,611
[SPEAKER_03]: That's even better.

608
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:30,372
[SPEAKER_03]: It's Stephen Lynch's releasing a new album.

609
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:31,578
[SPEAKER_04]: or Echo Image.

610
00:47:03,267 --> 00:47:04,209
[SPEAKER_02]: We're coming back.

611
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,130
[SPEAKER_02]: We're under a new label.

612
00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,996
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really working on that album that will never ever come out.

613
00:47:11,602 --> 00:47:11,923
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway.

614
00:47:14,764 --> 00:47:18,767
[SPEAKER_04]: Gosh, we've been going off on so many tangents tonight, and I had so many things I wanted to say, but I forgot, but that's alright.

615
00:47:19,167 --> 00:47:21,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I guess I should talk about my week and my day.

616
00:47:21,248 --> 00:47:24,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually been on vacation from work all this week, which is so nice.

617
00:47:24,590 --> 00:47:26,071
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't had to do shit at all.

618
00:47:26,151 --> 00:47:29,293
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't done a single goddamn thing, except I got my hair cut one day, which is kind of cool.

619
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:35,197
[SPEAKER_04]: Which sucks, because I have to go back to work tomorrow, and I'm not looking forward to having to catch up to a week's worth of email, but, you know, I'll live.

620
00:47:36,878 --> 00:47:42,101
[SPEAKER_04]: And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI while I was here.

621
00:47:43,482 --> 00:47:43,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki...

622
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:47,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody got their promivians done yesterday.

623
00:47:47,232 --> 00:47:47,532
[SPEAKER_04]: Son of a bitch!

624
00:47:47,552 --> 00:47:48,213
[SPEAKER_04]: The mic's not on.

625
00:47:50,415 --> 00:47:51,276
[SPEAKER_02]: Fucking asshole!

626
00:47:51,456 --> 00:47:52,116
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of a bitch!

627
00:47:52,157 --> 00:47:52,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, listen.

628
00:47:53,478 --> 00:47:55,920
[SPEAKER_03]: Why the hell does everybody... Okay, how much do you want of it?

629
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Does everyone have their AF done?

630
00:47:57,482 --> 00:47:59,003
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they sure as hell won't help me with mine.

631
00:47:59,023 --> 00:47:59,283
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't.

632
00:47:59,343 --> 00:47:59,604
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.

633
00:47:59,664 --> 00:48:00,124
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm only level 53.

634
00:48:00,164 --> 00:48:01,705
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have my AF done.

635
00:48:02,686 --> 00:48:03,127
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking AF.

636
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:07,491
[SPEAKER_03]: I only have, like... I have the boots, which are completely useless for a black mage, and...

637
00:48:08,018 --> 00:48:09,639
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have any of my Permovians done.

638
00:48:09,659 --> 00:48:13,621
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't even know why I have the chains of Permothia or whatever it is.

639
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:16,402
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't, I don't go to any of those places.

640
00:48:17,763 --> 00:48:19,344
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all experts at those Permovians now.

641
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:20,945
[SPEAKER_04]: We can run you through them like this.

642
00:48:21,105 --> 00:48:23,646
[SPEAKER_03]: I need, I've been trying to get back in and play.

643
00:48:23,706 --> 00:48:27,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I have too many things I'm trying to do at the same time.

644
00:48:27,228 --> 00:48:28,408
[SPEAKER_04]: It's for the best, honestly.

645
00:48:28,929 --> 00:48:31,770
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I probably won't be playing much Final Fantasy XI after this week because I won't have time.

646
00:48:32,691 --> 00:48:35,252
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I don't have time, but I'm buying World of Warcraft.

647
00:48:36,778 --> 00:48:40,019
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, at least one of us needs to be reporting on that game, so, fine.

648
00:48:40,039 --> 00:48:46,002
[SPEAKER_04]: Because World of Warcraft is this really big and popular game, and none of us are playing it, so.

649
00:48:46,082 --> 00:48:54,505
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at least they actually have some really cool system or game that's within the game, you know, sort of like a capture the flag type thing, but we have Ballista!

650
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:55,586
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!

651
00:48:55,626 --> 00:48:56,326
[SPEAKER_03]: Ballista!

652
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,747
[SPEAKER_03]: That was crap.

653
00:48:59,528 --> 00:49:00,208
[SPEAKER_04]: Beats Blitzball.

654
00:49:01,108 --> 00:49:01,688
[SPEAKER_04]: That's true.

655
00:49:01,849 --> 00:49:05,090
[SPEAKER_04]: I will take the Blitzball, or I'll take the Ballista minigame over...

656
00:49:05,894 --> 00:49:07,215
[SPEAKER_04]: That fucking card game in 8.

657
00:49:07,255 --> 00:49:09,917
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, thank God Tetra Master isn't in the game.

658
00:49:10,717 --> 00:49:11,438
[SPEAKER_04]: No, Tetra Master was 9.

659
00:49:11,738 --> 00:49:12,638
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a different card game in 8.

660
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:14,119
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty much the same thing though, wasn't it?

661
00:49:14,340 --> 00:49:15,640
[SPEAKER_09]: I never touched the card game, you know?

662
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:17,321
[SPEAKER_04]: The card game can suck my balls.

663
00:49:17,502 --> 00:49:18,322
[SPEAKER_04]: I hated the card game.

664
00:49:18,342 --> 00:49:18,922
[SPEAKER_09]: I never played it.

665
00:49:20,123 --> 00:49:22,705
[SPEAKER_04]: But you feel like you have to or you're going to miss out on items.

666
00:49:23,946 --> 00:49:24,946
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't feel like I had to.

667
00:49:25,447 --> 00:49:26,627
[SPEAKER_09]: I didn't care about missing out on items.

668
00:49:26,667 --> 00:49:27,588
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just how I play the game.

669
00:49:27,608 --> 00:49:30,730
[SPEAKER_09]: I got halfway through the third disc before I was like, screw it.

670
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:32,811
[SPEAKER_09]: I watched somebody else beat the game and I never touched it again.

671
00:49:34,693 --> 00:49:34,953
Okay.

672
00:49:35,865 --> 00:49:37,146
[SPEAKER_16]: Loki's Birthday Today

673
00:50:05,666 --> 00:50:06,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Happy birthday, Loki!

674
00:50:07,911 --> 00:50:08,272
[SPEAKER_04]: Yay!

675
00:50:08,532 --> 00:50:10,737
[SPEAKER_04]: So how old are you now?

676
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:10,737
25.

677
00:50:10,877 --> 00:50:11,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, a quarter century old.

678
00:50:11,759 --> 00:50:13,182
[SPEAKER_04]: Now how did you celebrate your birthday today?

679
00:50:13,757 --> 00:50:15,498
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to Olive Garden and had lunch.

680
00:50:15,858 --> 00:50:16,339
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.

681
00:50:16,479 --> 00:50:16,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Yummy.

682
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:23,924
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, since I was too cheap to get you a present today, I decided to leak Final Fantasy VII Advent Children on the internet for you.

683
00:50:24,384 --> 00:50:26,586
[SPEAKER_04]: So enjoy, because I know you really wanted that.

684
00:50:26,786 --> 00:50:29,508
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's been a lot of people doing the same type of thing for me.

685
00:50:29,948 --> 00:50:35,872
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, somebody leaked Burnout Legends on the internet, so I got to play that and Advent Children on the internet.

686
00:50:35,992 --> 00:50:38,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And what else was there that they leaked on the internet that I downloaded?

687
00:50:40,095 --> 00:50:41,056
[SPEAKER_03]: Some other stuff, I'm sure.

688
00:50:42,356 --> 00:50:43,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Burnout Legends was me.

689
00:50:44,486 --> 00:50:45,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, well, thank you.

690
00:50:45,026 --> 00:50:45,627
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it.

691
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:51,690
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, yeah, there's... I know there was one other thing that they did.

692
00:50:53,331 --> 00:50:58,475
[SPEAKER_04]: You know a DS game that everybody has been just going off about and just loving and adoring?

693
00:50:58,575 --> 00:51:03,878
[SPEAKER_04]: I need to pick this up because everybody is just wanting to make sweet love to this game and they're doing it in the chat room right now.

694
00:51:04,458 --> 00:51:05,339
[SPEAKER_04]: Advance Wars DS.

695
00:51:05,999 --> 00:51:09,401
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard lots of great things about this game, but I need to pick it up at some point.

696
00:51:11,122 --> 00:51:11,883
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a site.

697
00:51:12,003 --> 00:51:13,944
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make paper Advance Wars characters.

698
00:51:14,977 --> 00:51:16,197
[SPEAKER_04]: That's cheesy, but cute.

699
00:51:16,377 --> 00:51:17,037
[SPEAKER_04]: Very Nintendo.

700
00:51:17,057 --> 00:51:18,058
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very Nintendo thing to do.

701
00:51:18,818 --> 00:51:19,758
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Nintendo didn't do it.

702
00:51:19,778 --> 00:51:20,298
[SPEAKER_03]: Some guy did.

703
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:21,378
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's even worse.

704
00:51:21,718 --> 00:51:22,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever.

705
00:51:22,798 --> 00:51:24,059
[SPEAKER_04]: Where can they download this?

706
00:51:24,099 --> 00:51:25,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Wasn't it on Digg.com?

707
00:51:25,339 --> 00:51:26,419
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, Digg had a link to it.

708
00:51:26,939 --> 00:51:34,260
[SPEAKER_03]: Digg.com Yeah, it has a link to the... It's like Slashdot, but they pat themselves on the back way too much.

709
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:34,800
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

710
00:51:35,741 --> 00:51:38,721
And the stuff's relevant.

711

[SPEAKER_22]: And the stuff is sort of relevant.

712
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:44,462

01:00:03,271 --> 01:00:04,715
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to do an extra song this break.

731
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,818
[SPEAKER_04]: This one's a special dedication.

732
01:00:31,853 --> 01:00:44,535
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got to forever The green grass blows and the wind is dancing It would be a much better sight With you, with me If you hadn't met me I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

733
01:01:01,458 --> 01:01:03,180
[SPEAKER_15]: So now what should I do?

734
01:01:03,301 --> 01:01:10,649
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you've gone My supplies fell through And they gave me everything you had

735
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:28,673
He craved my happiness when you made me feel joy in me Just smile, but now I feel your stress Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no And who has time for tears?

736
01:01:28,713 --> 01:01:31,073
Never thought I'd sit around and unravel your love

737
01:01:56,517 --> 01:02:07,042
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi kids, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio here, episode number 155 in progress.

738
01:02:07,062 --> 01:02:08,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and joining us tonight.

739
01:02:09,203 --> 01:02:11,303
[SPEAKER_04]: I notice we have a lot more listeners than we usually do tonight.

740
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:24,229
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what the heck's going on, if we just are getting more people because of our podcast, or because I actually talked about it in the live journal community, or people are just going through withdrawals because we weren't here for two weeks, or just a combination of all the above, which I'm thinking is partly that.

741
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,911
[SPEAKER_04]: But regardless, thanks for tuning in and wasting your Sunday night with us.

742
01:02:27,971 --> 01:02:28,711
[SPEAKER_04]: We appreciate it.

743
01:02:29,952 --> 01:02:33,674
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're just here talking about what's on our mind.

744
01:02:33,754 --> 01:02:38,577
[SPEAKER_04]: Pop culture things, DDR, Bomani-related things as they come up, and what have you.

745
01:02:39,718 --> 01:02:42,159
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about Nintendo.

746
01:02:43,040 --> 01:02:44,100
[SPEAKER_04]: Nintendo pisses me off.

747
01:02:45,381 --> 01:02:48,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total Nintendo fanboy, but...

748
01:02:49,292 --> 01:02:55,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since I bought a widescreen TV, I've come to loathe Nintendo for their lack of support for widescreen and HD formats.

749
01:03:04,060 --> 01:03:09,943
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know why they're doing that in my opinion, especially as HDTVs become more and more the standard.

750
01:03:10,243 --> 01:03:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: I realize right now not a lot of people have HDTVs, but if you go shopping for a new TV, they're starting to get priced pretty competitively.

751
01:03:18,226 --> 01:03:28,111
[SPEAKER_04]: The TV I picked up was $600, which granted is quite a bit of money, but not that much more money than what you'd pay for a normal TV of the same size, probably about $200 more.

752
01:03:30,116 --> 01:03:35,702
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think as the technology gets older and older and we start getting into Christmas, I think HDTVs are really going to start taking over.

753
01:03:36,162 --> 01:03:43,790
[SPEAKER_04]: And Nintendo has this absolute lack of support for HDTVs and widescreen.

754
01:03:44,751 --> 01:03:50,858
[SPEAKER_04]: And I kind of realized that as I was trying to find a component cable for my Nintendo GameCube, because as you know, Loki...

755
01:03:51,451 --> 01:03:52,171
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

756
01:04:21,468 --> 01:04:23,869
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, maybe not that long ago, like a year ago or two years ago.

757
01:04:24,509 --> 01:04:26,150
[SPEAKER_04]: They discontinued production of the component cables.

758
01:04:26,170 --> 01:04:35,594
[SPEAKER_04]: And get this, your GameCube has to have a special port on the back that says digital in and out for you to even be able to use this component cable if you could find one.

759
01:04:36,155 --> 01:04:39,396
[SPEAKER_04]: The new GameCubes they made after mid-2004 don't have this.

760
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:42,991
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I have an old one.

761
01:04:43,051 --> 01:04:45,434
[SPEAKER_04]: They took a feature away from the new GameCube.

762
01:04:45,454 --> 01:04:47,537
[SPEAKER_04]: They took this digital out port away.

763
01:04:47,877 --> 01:04:48,938
[SPEAKER_04]: And their reason why?

764
01:04:49,339 --> 01:04:51,982
[SPEAKER_04]: They said less than 1% of our users were using it.

765
01:04:53,132 --> 01:04:57,074
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm thinking, well, okay, because the GameCube is kind of the kiddie system, right?

766
01:04:57,734 --> 01:05:04,497
[SPEAKER_04]: The GameCube is the thing that the kid has in their bedroom so that they can play Pokemon or whatever, right?

767
01:05:04,978 --> 01:05:10,820
[SPEAKER_04]: But the GameCube can also function as a pretty decent gaming system for the rest of us hardcore gamers, right?

768
01:05:10,961 --> 01:05:13,382
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, for instance, Resident Evil 4.

769
01:05:14,634 --> 01:05:16,075
[SPEAKER_04]: F-Zero, Smash Bros.

770
01:05:16,115 --> 01:05:21,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Melee, although it's kind of kiddy-like in its artwork, it's a great freaking game.

771
01:05:21,119 --> 01:05:23,080
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite games they put out on GameCube.

772
01:05:24,702 --> 01:05:29,705
[SPEAKER_04]: No support for HD because they say less than 1% are using the HD feature as it is.

773
01:05:31,887 --> 01:05:32,487
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't understand.

774
01:05:32,548 --> 01:05:35,290
[SPEAKER_04]: How much was it just to put that little extra port on the back?

775
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,510
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess maybe this was one of the costs.

776
01:05:36,931 --> 01:05:41,134
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this was a way that they made the GameCube cost only $80 was by taking this feature out, but...

777
01:05:43,584 --> 01:05:44,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Did the Famicom have it too?

778
01:05:44,685 --> 01:05:45,165
[SPEAKER_04]: The regular...

779
01:06:00,339 --> 01:06:02,160
[SPEAKER_04]: Bugs trying to say something about the Famicom had it too.

780
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,901
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the Japanese Famicom has it too.

781
01:06:04,001 --> 01:06:04,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I didn't realize that.

782
01:06:04,702 --> 01:06:08,004
[SPEAKER_04]: See, now the Nintendo America just had red and yellow wires.

783
01:06:08,044 --> 01:06:09,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, because that's all we had at the time.

784
01:06:09,184 --> 01:06:12,386
[SPEAKER_22]: We didn't have any sort of connectors to really do it with.

785
01:06:12,727 --> 01:06:22,613
[SPEAKER_04]: So that cable, while I guess that's kind of nice that you can take your Super Nintendo cable and use it on your Nintendo 64 and your GameCube, it hasn't changed in the last 15 years.

786
01:06:24,730 --> 01:06:25,371
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I don't know.

787
01:06:25,391 --> 01:06:27,352
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a little disappointed in Nintendo's lack of support.

788
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,155
[SPEAKER_04]: And some of the games on GameCube actually support widescreen TVs.

789
01:06:31,215 --> 01:06:32,797
[SPEAKER_04]: I played F-Zero on widescreen.

790
01:06:33,157 --> 01:06:35,319
[SPEAKER_04]: It was sexy as hell, but blurry.

791
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,862
[SPEAKER_04]: Blurry because S-Video is as high as it goes.

792
01:06:41,945 --> 01:06:43,065
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it sucks, too.

793
01:06:43,125 --> 01:06:55,168
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really limiting themselves because they were only, you know, wanting to put out, you know, family games because this whole, you know, they didn't really want to touch on the whole, you know, mature-rated games and stuff back when Mortal Kombat was out there.

794
01:06:55,188 --> 01:07:01,029
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, oh, we're just going to put out normal games, you know, and make this more kid-friendly system because that's what people were looking for.

795
01:07:01,769 --> 01:07:04,170
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they've kind of missed the bus.

796
01:07:04,490 --> 01:07:08,351
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, you know, this whole, well, there's not going to be, you know, that many...

797
01:07:09,344 --> 01:07:10,605
[SPEAKER_03]: Broadband TVs and stuff.

798
01:07:10,645 --> 01:07:11,526
[SPEAKER_03]: No one owns them right now.

799
01:07:11,646 --> 01:07:15,349
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, but people are going to be buying them in the future.

800
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:17,130
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you going to do with your game system then?

801
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:24,476
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm having a hard time believing that they're... It seems like they're trying to put out a system that will support what the market wants right now.

802
01:07:24,856 --> 01:07:31,361
[SPEAKER_04]: But no system ever really takes off at launch, except for maybe, I don't know, Super Nintendo maybe did.

803
01:07:31,822 --> 01:07:34,043
[SPEAKER_04]: But PlayStation even took a while to get big.

804
01:07:34,844 --> 01:07:38,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy 7, I'm going to just say this, it might piss some people off.

805
01:07:39,207 --> 01:07:41,889
[SPEAKER_04]: I think Final Fantasy 7 is when the PlayStation really started picking up.

806
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:49,415
[SPEAKER_04]: When Square announced that they were going to jump ship and go over and start making games for PlayStation, that's when the PlayStation really started selling and you saw a lot more games for it.

807
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:51,957
[SPEAKER_04]: That in addition to things like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot.

808
01:07:52,497 --> 01:07:54,138
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that was really the turning point.

809
01:07:56,880 --> 01:08:01,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Even PlayStation 2, their launch titles weren't humongous.

810
01:08:02,404 --> 01:08:03,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Fantavision...

811
01:08:05,006 --> 01:08:07,168
[SPEAKER_04]: So no system ever really takes off.

812
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:08,450
[SPEAKER_04]: And Xbox launch?

813
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:09,330
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't make me laugh.

814
01:08:10,852 --> 01:08:21,663
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think one of the only reasons PlayStation 2 had such a huge launch, which was probably one of the bigger ones in recent memory, which still wasn't, it's not like they were... I think it was riding on the success of the PlayStation.

815
01:08:22,163 --> 01:08:25,727
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that, the fact that it would play the old PlayStation games, and that it was a DVD player.

816
01:08:25,947 --> 01:08:27,829
[SPEAKER_04]: People were buying PlayStation 2s as DVD players.

817
01:08:28,100 --> 01:08:29,522
[SPEAKER_09]: That was actually really true in Japan.

818
01:08:29,962 --> 01:08:38,030
[SPEAKER_09]: But one thing about the DVD player on the PS2 is that it's a piece of crap, and using it as your primary DVD player will shorten the life of the system.

819
01:08:38,231 --> 01:08:39,172
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't believe that one bit.

820
01:08:39,312 --> 01:08:39,852
[SPEAKER_09]: That is true.

821
01:08:40,173 --> 01:08:42,675
[SPEAKER_03]: I used mine as my primary DVD player, never had a problem.

822
01:08:43,156 --> 01:08:44,257
[SPEAKER_09]: You are in the minority then.

823
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:48,524
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard of the problems, but I've yet to see it.

824
01:08:48,884 --> 01:08:59,613
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan has told me that just about every return within the first few years of the PS2's release were, basically, they were sliding off the track.

825
01:08:59,693 --> 01:09:00,774
[SPEAKER_09]: It was everything related.

826
01:09:01,234 --> 01:09:05,398
[SPEAKER_09]: Everyone who brought theirs back was because they were using it as a primary DVD player.

827
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:09,582
[SPEAKER_04]: I've used both my PlayStation 2 and my Xbox as DVD players.

828
01:09:09,622 --> 01:09:12,284
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tell you right now, the Xbox is a better DVD player, hands down.

829
01:09:12,484 --> 01:09:15,026
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah, because it's a more intelligently built system.

830
01:09:15,046 --> 01:09:16,927
[SPEAKER_04]: It better be if you've got to pay $20 extra to use it.

831
01:09:16,987 --> 01:09:18,148
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that too.

832
01:09:18,368 --> 01:09:19,129
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact, oh, that.

833
01:09:19,149 --> 01:09:21,430
[SPEAKER_04]: Microsoft can blow me for that.

834
01:09:21,450 --> 01:09:25,133
[SPEAKER_09]: The Xbox itself, though, is a more intelligently constructed piece of equipment.

835
01:09:26,304 --> 01:09:27,264
[SPEAKER_04]: In a way, in a way.

836
01:09:27,584 --> 01:09:28,925
[SPEAKER_09]: It's made of better parts.

837
01:09:30,605 --> 01:09:33,446
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a more stable system.

838
01:09:34,346 --> 01:09:39,087
[SPEAKER_09]: I bet if you drop a PS2 and an Xbox, less of the Xbox will break.

839
01:09:41,028 --> 01:09:41,288
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe.

840
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:43,389
[SPEAKER_04]: I love... Because it's so damn heavy.

841
01:09:44,549 --> 01:09:47,370
[SPEAKER_03]: Microsoft is awesome because they...

842
01:09:50,049 --> 01:09:54,953
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh yeah, well this time around, you know, you don't have to pay extra to get your wonderful DVD remote.

843
01:09:54,973 --> 01:09:56,334
[SPEAKER_03]: You can watch DVDs right out of the box.

844
01:09:56,394 --> 01:10:00,317
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone's like, oh yeah, but you gotta buy your hard drive.

845
01:10:07,502 --> 01:10:12,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, so yeah, they're sticking it to you in another way now.

846
01:10:13,286 --> 01:10:15,988
[SPEAKER_09]: No route to host.

847
01:10:16,008 --> 01:10:16,308
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.

848
01:10:17,109 --> 01:10:17,369
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

849
01:10:20,569 --> 01:10:22,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, moving on.

850
01:10:26,293 --> 01:10:27,314
[SPEAKER_04]: What was I going to talk about here?

851
01:10:27,854 --> 01:10:32,217
[SPEAKER_04]: A little follow-up to something we were talking about earlier in the program.

852
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:37,361
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking about those in-the-groove tournaments that are going on around the nation.

853
01:10:37,421 --> 01:10:39,883
[SPEAKER_04]: I said that Milpitas is going to be having one, I think.

854
01:10:40,003 --> 01:10:41,083
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, go figure.

855
01:10:41,464 --> 01:10:44,846
[SPEAKER_04]: The person who's actually helping to put on this tournament is actually listening tonight.

856
01:10:46,182 --> 01:10:51,084
[SPEAKER_04]: and gave me a link to more information on the In The Groove tournament that's going to go on at Milpitas Golf Land.

857
01:10:51,104 --> 01:10:57,386
[SPEAKER_04]: So for those of you guys that happen to be in Northern California, September 24th, 2005 is the date of the tournament.

858
01:10:58,147 --> 01:10:58,467
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 a.m.

859
01:10:58,527 --> 01:10:59,347
[SPEAKER_04]: for registration.

860
01:10:59,467 --> 01:11:01,848
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten bucks will get you in the tournament.

861
01:11:02,028 --> 01:11:02,908
[SPEAKER_04]: Ten dollars flat.

862
01:11:02,948 --> 01:11:04,369
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no pre-reg fees, nothing.

863
01:11:04,729 --> 01:11:07,650
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a straight-up perfect attack, expert only.

864
01:11:08,150 --> 01:11:11,432
[SPEAKER_04]: You can find more complete rules over on DDR Freak and their tournament forums.

865
01:11:12,796 --> 01:11:17,819
[SPEAKER_04]: But since it's in the Groove Expert Tournament and I'm too old and too fat, yeah, I will not be entering this tournament.

866
01:11:17,839 --> 01:11:18,839
[SPEAKER_04]: But I might go just to have fun.

867
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:20,760
[SPEAKER_04]: Just to see people, but we'll see.

868
01:11:22,141 --> 01:11:22,681
[SPEAKER_04]: So check that out.

869
01:11:24,402 --> 01:11:27,103
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, I will not be attending this tournament.

870
01:11:28,924 --> 01:11:33,387
[SPEAKER_04]: You wouldn't go just to socialize with people?

871
01:11:34,647 --> 01:11:34,807
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

872
01:11:36,308 --> 01:11:36,788
[SPEAKER_04]: Just curious.

873
01:11:38,129 --> 01:11:41,891
[SPEAKER_03]: The only thing I would want a boxer for in the first place

874
01:11:42,495 --> 01:11:45,516
[SPEAKER_03]: is to have a good system to run Step Mania on.

875
01:11:47,476 --> 01:11:49,096
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really all I wanted for Food Mix.

876
01:11:49,316 --> 01:11:50,457
[SPEAKER_03]: Food Mix, the arcade game.

877
01:11:50,957 --> 01:11:53,097
[SPEAKER_03]: Much better use of the boxer than In The Groove.

878
01:11:53,117 --> 01:11:53,497
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways.

879
01:11:55,638 --> 01:12:01,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, you can find more information on an In The Groove tournament happening near you on InTheGroove.com.

880
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:03,979
[SPEAKER_04]: They're doing this big national thingy.

881
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:09,321
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell them, Red Octane, or not even Red Octane, Rockstar, get a hold of those guys in Japan.

882
01:12:09,341 --> 01:12:10,221
[SPEAKER_03]: They're making good music.

883
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:11,421
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm telling you, you could...

884
01:12:11,974 --> 01:12:12,615
[SPEAKER_03]: MC Groove's Dance Craze

885
01:12:37,027 --> 01:12:37,627
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, it's horrible.

886
01:12:38,567 --> 01:12:42,228
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what Mad Catz helped put out recently, though, that's actually pretty damn good?

887
01:12:42,668 --> 01:12:43,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up.

888
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:46,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Pump It Up Exceed, home version, kicks ass.

889
01:12:47,189 --> 01:12:49,570
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very surprised, but it kicks a lot of ass.

890
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:56,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Despite the fact that I still hate the interface, I can't stand the way you go around and you pick your songs, it's better than it used to be.

891
01:12:57,811 --> 01:13:00,912
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about as good as that Pump It Up system's gonna get, the home version.

892
01:13:02,859 --> 01:13:05,280
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a whole assload of songs in this game.

893
01:13:05,300 --> 01:13:07,862
[SPEAKER_04]: They kind of split up the songs into three channels.

894
01:13:08,222 --> 01:13:12,144
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your Banya channel, and Banya's kind of like the Naoki of Pump It Up.

895
01:13:12,585 --> 01:13:15,366
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it does a lot of these, just a variety of different types of songs.

896
01:13:15,386 --> 01:13:17,948
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's like 97 songs in the Banya channel, and...

897
01:13:18,648 --> 01:13:19,329
[SPEAKER_03]: 4 and the other one?

898
01:13:19,449 --> 01:13:21,830
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's actually pretty evenly spaced out.

899
01:13:21,870 --> 01:13:22,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it to him for that.

900
01:13:22,550 --> 01:13:23,831
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about 30 songs apiece.

901
01:13:24,311 --> 01:13:27,232
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got the K-pop station, which is pretty rad.

902
01:13:27,252 --> 01:13:32,735
[SPEAKER_04]: They've got a lot of songs under K-pop, including some songs you might recognize from DDR, such as Starion.

903
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:35,256
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the other one?

904
01:13:36,197 --> 01:13:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: Caution?

905
01:13:38,035 --> 01:13:39,015
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

906
01:14:03,444 --> 01:14:08,245
[SPEAKER_04]: Booby Law, I can't remember the name of the song, I just know it's the booby song because it's the video that has just the chick with the boobs.

907
01:14:09,105 --> 01:14:12,826
[SPEAKER_04]: Soka Meki Ranran, that one, and Kiss Me is in Exceed 2.

908
01:14:13,126 --> 01:14:16,947
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a couple songs in the arcade, and then some interesting American exclusives.

909
01:14:18,147 --> 01:14:22,648
[SPEAKER_04]: Crystal Method is in there, and Elvis has a song in there.

910
01:14:22,748 --> 01:14:27,889
[SPEAKER_04]: That one Australian band with the crazy video, I can't remember the name of the song.

911
01:14:29,729 --> 01:14:31,550
[SPEAKER_04]: The song's like, forget it, forget it.

912
01:14:34,744 --> 01:14:36,065
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

913
01:15:02,101 --> 01:15:04,762
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but you have to read the arrows a whole different way.

914
01:15:04,802 --> 01:15:06,984
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a different way of reading them with the colors and everything.

915
01:15:07,024 --> 01:15:08,484
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little bit of a challenge at first.

916
01:15:09,705 --> 01:15:18,269
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are some crazy-ass step patterns that shame in the grooves, step patterns even, in regions of difficulty, if that's what you're into.

917
01:15:18,689 --> 01:15:21,650
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that kind of stuff is retarded, so I don't play that.

918
01:15:22,391 --> 01:15:31,035
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't really, just, you know, my friend made me look at a few of the really, really tough step charts, and I just kind of went, stupid, and went back to playing the more fun steps.

919
01:15:32,205 --> 01:15:34,006
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually really enjoy Pump It Up Exceed.

920
01:15:34,786 --> 01:15:35,366
[SPEAKER_04]: I recommend it.

921
01:15:35,606 --> 01:15:37,487
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys are into the dance games, pick this up.

922
01:15:37,527 --> 01:15:39,608
[SPEAKER_04]: This will hold you over until the DDR releases.

923
01:15:39,948 --> 01:15:50,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Now granted, the downside is that you have to get a whole new pad with this, so the bundle's going to cost you about $60, but the soft pad that comes with it is actually pretty darn nice.

924
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:55,375
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a better quality than those Konami soft pads they put out.

925
01:15:59,056 --> 01:15:59,477
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty nice.

926
01:16:00,237 --> 01:16:00,617
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoyed it.

927
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:09,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Dance Revolution Strike Dance Dance Revolution Strike Dance Dance Revolution Strike

928
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:30,701
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very strange name, isn't it, for the game.

929
01:16:30,741 --> 01:16:31,281
[SPEAKER_04]: But whatever.

930
01:16:31,721 --> 01:16:40,604
[SPEAKER_04]: Dance Festival Revolution Strike, the I being an exclamation point, will be shown at the Tokyo Game Show 2005, so they say.

931
01:16:40,624 --> 01:16:41,064
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple days.

932
01:16:41,384 --> 01:16:42,484
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, a couple days away.

933
01:16:43,405 --> 01:16:48,666
[SPEAKER_04]: It's supposed to have that same interface as Extreme 2 and Dancing Stage Max, of course, overseas in Europe.

934
01:16:49,886 --> 01:16:56,068
[SPEAKER_04]: The website for the game also had a special little page set up talking about the new Naoki song called Passion...

935
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,385
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost thought it was Passion in Love.

936
01:16:59,625 --> 01:17:01,946
[SPEAKER_04]: Passion of Love, Naoki featuring Paula Terry.

937
01:17:01,986 --> 01:17:05,787
[SPEAKER_04]: So you might remember the rumors a while back that Paula Terry was in studio recording something for Naoki.

938
01:17:06,127 --> 01:17:06,727
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it is.

939
01:17:07,047 --> 01:17:09,728
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's going to be featured in Dance Dance Revolution Strike.

940
01:17:10,308 --> 01:17:20,330
[SPEAKER_04]: No word yet as to whether it's going to be inside EX2 or the European version of Dancing Stage Max as of yet.

941
01:17:20,971 --> 01:17:21,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll see.

942
01:17:21,371 --> 01:17:22,571
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure it will be.

943
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:28,709
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, yeah, I'm pretty sure it will be, too, but nothing's said one way or the other yet.

944
01:17:29,850 --> 01:17:36,093
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know when this game will actually be coming out, but end of year, early next?

945
01:17:36,874 --> 01:17:36,093
2006.

946
01:17:37,114 --> 01:17:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: 2006?

947
01:17:37,994 --> 01:17:38,295
[SPEAKER_03]: Spring.

948
01:17:40,076 --> 01:17:40,676
[SPEAKER_04]: 2006 it is, then.

949
01:17:43,998 --> 01:17:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

950
01:17:46,059 --> 01:17:46,780
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go to a break.

951
01:17:47,120 --> 01:17:49,801
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back from this break, did your download finish?

952
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:50,482
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost?

953
01:17:50,542 --> 01:17:50,782
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost.

954
01:17:51,838 --> 01:17:53,319
[SPEAKER_03]: Try me back at about 8.30.

955
01:17:53,579 --> 01:17:55,800
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying a little while?

956
01:17:55,820 --> 01:17:55,800
8.30.

957
01:17:56,161 --> 01:17:56,441
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

958
01:17:57,081 --> 01:17:57,221
[SPEAKER_03]: Ish.

959
01:17:58,662 --> 01:17:59,142
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll do that.

960
01:17:59,182 --> 01:18:00,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Stupid slow FTP.

961
01:18:02,985 --> 01:18:08,168
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, Loki wanted me to play something from the disc he brought last week.

962
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:08,448
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes!

963
01:18:08,828 --> 01:18:09,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally!

964
01:18:10,109 --> 01:18:10,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally!

965
01:18:10,829 --> 01:18:13,711
[SPEAKER_03]: We picked up the new Diverse System albums.

966
01:18:14,088 --> 01:18:35,614
[SPEAKER_03]: D7, all three CDs of that, D8, and also Dear Mr. Taka, plus some other special stuff like the Chorus K album and the Good Cool Ultra Expander CD, which has the most kickass remix to Absolute, which you might have heard if you downloaded our non-show last week.

967
01:18:36,528 --> 01:18:38,789
[SPEAKER_03]: and lots of good stuff.

968
01:18:39,349 --> 01:18:47,353
[SPEAKER_03]: My personal favorite for D7, and I was waiting ever since I heard the little teaser for it, was the Trip Machine Dark Core mix.

969
01:18:48,773 --> 01:18:49,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.

970
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:53,035
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a remix of Ecstasy on there, which is really cool.

971
01:18:53,855 --> 01:18:54,976
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few other things.

972
01:18:54,996 --> 01:18:59,538
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a remix of Love Love Shine, which is interesting.

973
01:19:00,370 --> 01:19:01,491
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so what am I going to play here?

974
01:19:01,811 --> 01:19:04,554
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I think we should play the Trip Machine Dark Core Mix.

975
01:19:04,614 --> 01:19:04,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Where's that?

976
01:19:05,194 --> 01:19:06,576
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a D7.

977
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:07,497
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you have the wrong CD.

978
01:19:07,977 --> 01:19:08,518
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.

979
01:19:12,822 --> 01:19:13,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-oh.

980
01:19:13,902 --> 01:19:14,783
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the one, isn't it?

981
01:19:14,823 --> 01:19:16,445
[SPEAKER_04]: The Dear Mr. Talk and all that stuff?

982
01:19:16,525 --> 01:19:17,646
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but this is my other one.

983
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:18,967
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a second CD.

984
01:19:19,428 --> 01:19:21,189
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that on your thing over there.

985
01:19:21,249 --> 01:19:21,610
[SPEAKER_03]: Is this it?

986
01:19:22,931 --> 01:19:23,051
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

987
01:19:23,291 --> 01:19:23,792
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's blank.

988
01:19:24,012 --> 01:19:24,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, crap.

989
01:19:26,114 --> 01:19:26,294
Okay.

990
01:19:27,330 --> 01:19:28,371
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it around somewhere.

991
01:19:28,411 --> 01:19:29,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll keep looking for it.

992
01:19:29,252 --> 01:19:29,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there something on that CD?

993
01:19:30,012 --> 01:19:31,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we'll find them.

994
01:19:31,573 --> 01:19:32,314
[SPEAKER_03]: See what's on here.

995
01:19:34,276 --> 01:19:36,657
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... Okay.

996
01:19:38,018 --> 01:19:39,780
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, it might have been in a case for you.

997
01:19:39,940 --> 01:19:41,101
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I put it in a case.

998
01:19:42,642 --> 01:19:43,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Or something.

999
01:19:44,323 --> 01:19:44,424
[SPEAKER_03]: No.

1000
01:19:45,765 --> 01:19:46,345
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that's not it.

1001
01:19:47,686 --> 01:19:50,708
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... So anyways, we've got some stuff on here.

1002
01:19:51,089 --> 01:19:53,611
[SPEAKER_03]: Um... The diverse system stuff.

1003
01:19:53,791 --> 01:19:55,732
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dear Mr. Taka, which is cool.

1004
01:19:56,313 --> 01:19:56,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1005
01:19:58,445 --> 01:20:01,588
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, let's play something from Good Cool Ultra Expander.

1006
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:09,194
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's play the Absolute Ultimate Remix again, because that's good.

1007
01:20:10,435 --> 01:20:16,320
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play the Absolute Ultimate Remix.

1008
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:19,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely lives up to its name.

1009
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:20,984
[SPEAKER_04]: This is pretty cool.

1010
01:20:21,004 --> 01:20:22,245
[SPEAKER_04]: We heard a little bit of this last week.

1011
01:20:22,345 --> 01:20:24,827
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll try to find the other CD in the meantime.

1012
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:25,608
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we will.

1013
01:20:26,963 --> 01:20:30,847
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio and your phone calls.

1014
01:20:32,829 --> 01:20:33,570
[SPEAKER_04]: Lost sound there for a minute.

1015
01:20:33,770 --> 01:20:35,832
[SPEAKER_04]: We will get to your phone calls this next break, we promise.

1016

[SPEAKER_04]: Who's the artist on this?

1027
01:25:23,713 --> 01:25:24,213
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember.

1028
01:25:24,434 --> 01:25:25,174
[SPEAKER_04]: Just Diverse System.

1029
01:25:25,234 --> 01:25:25,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1030
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:51,129

Thanks for watching!

1035
01:29:45,851 --> 01:29:48,832
[SPEAKER_04]: Trip Machine, the Dark Core mix here on Orange Launch Radio.

1036
01:29:49,493 --> 01:29:52,414
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was some music from the new Diverse Systems 7 album.

1037
01:29:53,114 --> 01:29:55,275
[SPEAKER_04]: Not as new as Diverse Systems 8, though, which is also out.

1038
01:29:55,976 --> 01:29:56,636
[SPEAKER_04]: So look for those.

1039
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:58,677
[SPEAKER_04]: And Diverse 9, which is coming.

1040
01:29:58,977 --> 01:29:59,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming very soon.

1041
01:30:00,578 --> 01:30:01,318
[SPEAKER_04]: Alrighty, very cool.

1042
01:30:02,199 --> 01:30:05,000
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people said they couldn't hear the Trip Machine in that.

1043
01:30:06,461 --> 01:30:08,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Our chat room was kind of going, that's Trip Machine?

1044
01:30:08,062 --> 01:30:08,782
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard Trip Machine.

1045
01:30:08,822 --> 01:30:10,863
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see how you couldn't have heard it.

1046
01:30:11,003 --> 01:30:12,984
[SPEAKER_04]: The synth lines are the same.

1047
01:30:13,024 --> 01:30:14,885
[SPEAKER_04]: The synth lines are the same, but...

1048
01:30:15,447 --> 01:30:18,269
[SPEAKER_08]: Where's my... Mommy, can you sing Trip Machine?

1049
01:30:18,309 --> 01:30:18,909
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was that?

1050
01:30:19,089 --> 01:30:19,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Where was that?

1051
01:30:19,750 --> 01:30:23,252
[SPEAKER_03]: It was on the Trip Machines, like, drum and bass, and this is, like, Dark Horse, so it's a little different.

1052
01:30:23,392 --> 01:30:23,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I liked it.

1053
01:30:23,952 --> 01:30:25,093
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought it was cool.

1054
01:30:25,493 --> 01:30:26,454
[SPEAKER_03]: But... It was okay.

1055
01:30:27,234 --> 01:30:27,554
[SPEAKER_03]: It was okay.

1056
01:30:27,574 --> 01:30:29,876
[SPEAKER_09]: I think this is the only way to possibly like Trip Machine.

1057
01:30:29,916 --> 01:30:32,397
[SPEAKER_09]: There is an interesting... The normal versions are horrible.

1058
01:30:32,717 --> 01:30:42,884
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a blues version of, um... Or, like, kind of like a jazzy blues type version of, um... I want to say, um... Oh, God.

1059
01:30:42,904 --> 01:30:42,944
[SPEAKER_03]: Um...

1060
01:30:44,620 --> 01:30:47,082
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Make Your Move, but one of the older ones.

1061
01:30:47,622 --> 01:30:51,185
[SPEAKER_03]: Not Put Your Faith In Me, Keep On Movin'.

1062
01:30:51,846 --> 01:30:52,646
[SPEAKER_03]: That's on one of them, too.

1063
01:30:52,666 --> 01:30:53,407
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll have to play that later.

1064
01:30:53,447 --> 01:30:54,928
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of funny.

1065
01:30:54,948 --> 01:30:57,190
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it actually sound like Keep On Movin'?

1066
01:30:57,250 --> 01:30:57,991
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1067
01:30:58,111 --> 01:31:02,454
[SPEAKER_03]: And they also have the long version of Made In Innocent, which was in Food Mix 2.

1068
01:31:02,935 --> 01:31:06,177
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Food Mix Plus, I want to say.

1069
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:08,259
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm getting confused here.

1070
01:31:08,279 --> 01:31:09,159
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, Food Mix Plus.

1071
01:31:10,721 --> 01:31:11,021
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

1072
01:31:12,557 --> 01:31:15,017
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio

1073
01:31:41,817 --> 01:31:47,724
[SPEAKER_04]: While we sit there and wait for somebody to call us, because there's not a whole lot of people logged into Skype, so I don't know if we'll even get anything here.

1074
01:31:48,404 --> 01:31:50,226
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to make sure this gets a mention here.

1075
01:31:50,266 --> 01:31:51,848
[SPEAKER_04]: This was something that happened while we were gone.

1076
01:31:52,869 --> 01:31:57,535
[SPEAKER_04]: GuitarFreaks and DrumManiaV2 on their way out.

1077
01:31:58,456 --> 01:32:00,438
[SPEAKER_04]: They do have a website opened up.

1078
01:32:01,162 --> 01:32:12,752
[SPEAKER_04]: We link to it from our website over at OrangeLaunchRadio.com, but it's konami.jp.am.locationtest, because this is something that's currently location testing, Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, V2.

1079
01:32:13,112 --> 01:32:26,963
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, the reason why Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is now V is because they did a little bit of a hardware upgrade on the stuff there when they put out V. They did a little bit of a hardware upgrade, so now they have the full videos and everything.

1080
01:32:27,504 --> 01:32:28,745
[SPEAKER_04]: The game's just a little bit prettier.

1081
01:32:29,910 --> 01:32:31,991
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's something to be looking forward to.

1082
01:32:32,291 --> 01:32:32,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's take a call.

1083

01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:28,270
[SPEAKER_21]: As of now.

1162
01:38:29,211 --> 01:38:31,012
[SPEAKER_04]: So, usually what?

1163
01:38:31,032 --> 01:38:35,896
[SPEAKER_04]: The location test goes on for about a month, and then they go back for a month or two, and then the game comes out, usually, right?

1164
01:38:36,517 --> 01:38:36,717
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so...

1165
01:38:37,330 --> 01:38:45,756
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I forgot to mention, about Tokyo Game Show, I checked on their website, and they just recently announced Poppin' Music 12 Iroha for the PlayStation 2.

1166
01:38:46,456 --> 01:38:47,697
[SPEAKER_04]: Big surprise, not.

1167
01:38:49,738 --> 01:38:56,863
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, honestly, Poppin' Music's been constantly coming out for the PlayStation 2, so that's no surprise at all, but that's good for the Poppin' Music fans, of course.

1168
01:38:57,343 --> 01:38:57,683
[SPEAKER_04]: Good news.

1169
01:38:59,338 --> 01:38:59,638
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1170
01:39:00,258 --> 01:39:00,778
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds cool.

1171
01:39:01,019 --> 01:39:03,179
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, Tokyo Game Show is happening this week, right?

1172
01:39:03,319 --> 01:39:04,840
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, like this Thursday.

1173
01:39:05,000 --> 01:39:05,420
[SPEAKER_04]: This week.

1174
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:06,660
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.

1175
01:39:07,040 --> 01:39:14,043
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to go, since I can't read the Japanese, you've got to go on some of those sites and look at the news and come back and let us know.

1176
01:39:14,063 --> 01:39:14,943
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what else is good?

1177
01:39:15,283 --> 01:39:15,523
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1178
01:39:15,903 --> 01:39:17,204
[SPEAKER_03]: Revolution news.

1179
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:19,524
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to show the controller and everything in Mario 128.

1180
01:39:19,564 --> 01:39:21,905
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to get a lot of news this week from Tokyo Game Show.

1181
01:39:21,945 --> 01:39:22,165
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

1182
01:39:22,465 --> 01:39:22,885
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited.

1183
01:39:23,145 --> 01:39:23,405
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1184
01:39:24,806 --> 01:39:25,166
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1185
01:39:25,886 --> 01:39:27,687
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and one more thing.

1186
01:39:27,707 --> 01:39:28,107
[SPEAKER_16]: Mm-hmm.

1187
01:39:29,825 --> 01:39:31,986
[SPEAKER_21]: It's not Kekak, it's Kekak.

1188
01:39:32,267 --> 01:39:32,807
[SPEAKER_21]: Kekak.

1189
01:39:33,448 --> 01:39:34,248
[SPEAKER_21]: I like Kekak.

1190
01:39:34,869 --> 01:39:38,332
[SPEAKER_21]: No, you have to go to Indonesia, believe me, it's Kekak.

1191
01:39:38,852 --> 01:39:43,196
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't doubt that the pronunciation I'm doing is horribly wrong, but, you know, I like Kekak.

1192
01:39:45,037 --> 01:39:45,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Kekak.

1193
01:39:46,799 --> 01:39:48,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I said it once correctly just for you.

1194
01:39:48,861 --> 01:39:49,161
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1195
01:39:50,482 --> 01:39:56,787
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, and, you know, just after I go off, just announce to them about the 10th style CS.

1196
01:39:57,088 --> 01:39:57,368
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

1197
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:02,301
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I already, you know, I already pre-ordered mine.

1198
01:40:02,841 --> 01:40:03,782
[SPEAKER_04]: When's the street date for that?

1199
01:40:03,822 --> 01:40:05,103
[SPEAKER_21]: Isn't that October?

1200
01:40:05,523 --> 01:40:06,303
[SPEAKER_21]: November 17th.

1201
01:40:06,323 --> 01:40:07,084
[SPEAKER_21]: November 17th.

1202
01:40:07,244 --> 01:40:07,444
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1203
01:40:07,864 --> 01:40:11,606
[SPEAKER_04]: So, don't you remember last year, November was, like, a huge month for Bomani?

1204
01:40:11,626 --> 01:40:16,188
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we got, like, Ultramix 2, 8-Style, and Poppin' Music, like, 10, I think it was?

1205
01:40:16,328 --> 01:40:17,168
[SPEAKER_03]: All in, like, the same day.

1206
01:40:17,188 --> 01:40:23,151
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember, as I mentioned on the non-show, that the new DDRs and the new...

1207
01:40:24,492 --> 01:40:27,354
[SPEAKER_03]: Carriker Revolutions are going to have demos for each different version.

1208
01:40:27,414 --> 01:40:28,274
[SPEAKER_04]: That's out there now.

1209
01:40:28,354 --> 01:40:31,056
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the news sites published that in their review.

1210
01:40:31,156 --> 01:40:35,678
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's out there now where everybody knows that you can play demos in one and the other.

1211
01:40:36,799 --> 01:40:41,061
[SPEAKER_21]: And I still envy those people at Rhode Island right now because they have Happy Sky.

1212
01:40:41,341 --> 01:40:41,881
[SPEAKER_04]: I heard.

1213
01:40:42,122 --> 01:40:49,025
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was talking to Miklatov over the weekend and he said that he damn near got on a plane to go out there to play it.

1214
01:40:49,045 --> 01:40:49,966
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, you're crazy.

1215
01:40:49,986 --> 01:40:50,346
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah.

1216
01:40:50,366 --> 01:40:53,828
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if you got your simulators out there, I have all the key sound to BMS files.

1217
01:40:54,949 --> 01:40:55,469
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy Sky Lobster

1218
01:41:16,574 --> 01:41:18,715
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, anything else you wanted to share with us tonight, Siggy?

1219
01:41:18,735 --> 01:41:19,775
[SPEAKER_21]: Nothing much else.

1220
01:41:20,195 --> 01:41:23,376
[SPEAKER_21]: I'll just let you know what news are going to come out.

1221
01:41:23,737 --> 01:41:24,257
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds good.

1222
01:41:25,037 --> 01:41:25,877
[SPEAKER_21]: Tokyo Game Show.

1223
01:41:27,038 --> 01:41:27,778
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, sounds good.

1224
01:41:28,378 --> 01:41:28,598
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

1225
01:41:29,959 --> 01:41:30,199
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

1226
01:41:32,380 --> 01:41:34,740
[SPEAKER_21]: Right, nothing much else.

1227
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:35,761
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess that's it then.

1228
01:41:35,781 --> 01:41:37,121
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go to some new calls, alrighty?

1229
01:41:39,002 --> 01:41:39,182
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah.

1230
01:41:39,322 --> 01:41:39,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, okay.

1231
01:41:40,442 --> 01:41:40,662
[SPEAKER_04]: Later.

1232
01:41:40,822 --> 01:41:41,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Take care.

1233
01:41:41,383 --> 01:41:41,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1234
01:41:42,243 --> 01:41:42,423
[SPEAKER_16]: Later.

1235
01:41:44,580 --> 01:41:47,162
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to another call.

1236
01:41:47,282 --> 01:41:49,264
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1237
01:41:49,324 --> 01:41:49,804
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I think.

1238
01:41:50,304 --> 01:41:50,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello?

1239
01:41:51,305 --> 01:41:52,066
[SPEAKER_24]: Yes, I'm right here.

1240
01:41:52,106 --> 01:41:53,307
[SPEAKER_24]: This is one and only Ron John.

1241
01:41:53,327 --> 01:41:54,007
[SPEAKER_24]: What's up, fellas?

1242
01:41:54,448 --> 01:41:57,230
[SPEAKER_04]: My timer didn't show up there for a minute there.

1243
01:41:58,251 --> 01:41:59,351
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura is not a fella.

1244
01:41:59,652 --> 01:42:00,232
[SPEAKER_24]: Hi, Ron John.

1245
01:42:01,113 --> 01:42:01,933
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, honey, what's up?

1246
01:42:02,974 --> 01:42:04,636
[SPEAKER_04]: How you doing?

1247
01:42:04,656 --> 01:42:05,076
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind?

1248
01:42:06,075 --> 01:42:06,395
[SPEAKER_24]: Not much.

1249
01:42:06,415 --> 01:42:07,616
[SPEAKER_24]: I got some information here.

1250
01:42:08,516 --> 01:42:15,858
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know if you guys know this, but it seems that Katamari Damacy 2 or We Love Katamari came out early.

1251
01:42:16,839 --> 01:42:17,839
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out early?

1252
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:18,399
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.

1253
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:18,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.

1254
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:20,380
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

1255
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:22,360
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy who works for the game distributor says no.

1256
01:42:23,441 --> 01:42:28,322
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, I have a link here to somebody who went to Target and bought it today.

1257
01:42:29,723 --> 01:42:29,943
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.

1258
01:42:30,803 --> 01:42:31,724
[SPEAKER_03]: Target broke street.

1259
01:42:31,964 --> 01:42:32,844
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just...

1260
01:42:33,530 --> 01:42:35,632
[SPEAKER_24]: That's exactly what I said when I found it earlier.

1261
01:42:35,932 --> 01:42:36,973
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't come out until the 21st.

1262
01:42:37,113 --> 01:42:39,255
[SPEAKER_03]: It got pushed back because they weren't done with it yet.

1263
01:42:39,275 --> 01:42:40,777
[SPEAKER_03]: It hasn't even been pressed yet.

1264
01:42:41,097 --> 01:42:42,938
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, but how do they go to Target and get a copy then?

1265
01:42:43,179 --> 01:42:43,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck if I know.

1266
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:45,501
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1267
01:42:45,701 --> 01:42:50,785
[SPEAKER_03]: All I know is they really did a really shitty job of making new box art for it.

1268
01:42:50,845 --> 01:42:52,027
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the cover art's shit.

1269
01:42:52,307 --> 01:42:53,328
[SPEAKER_04]: So okay, give me this link.

1270
01:42:53,348 --> 01:42:54,048
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to look at it.

1271
01:42:54,409 --> 01:42:54,809
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there.

1272
01:42:55,149 --> 01:42:55,790
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, let's see.

1273
01:42:57,688 --> 01:42:59,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see what this is all about right here.

1274
01:42:59,368 --> 01:43:02,049
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so this link got posted in our chat room.

1275
01:43:02,909 --> 01:43:06,870
[SPEAKER_04]: www.orangeloungeradio.com Excuse me.

1276
01:43:07,070 --> 01:43:12,632
[SPEAKER_04]: Orangeloungeradio.com slash chat, or I'm sorry, click on the link that says chat.

1277
01:43:13,292 --> 01:43:13,772
[SPEAKER_04]: And here it is.

1278
01:43:13,812 --> 01:43:21,074
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody posted, go to Target now, and they've got their little Target bag with the receipt and the little game, We Heart Katamari, Sony Software, $29.99.

1279
01:43:22,094 --> 01:43:23,055
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1280
01:43:24,215 --> 01:43:24,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1281
01:43:25,245 --> 01:43:26,206
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, whatever.

1282
01:43:50,067 --> 01:43:53,951
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm hitting up Target.com to see if it was just that store Where's that dude live?

1283
01:43:54,031 --> 01:43:54,512
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we know?

1284
01:44:14,766 --> 01:44:15,367
[SPEAKER_24]: I don't know.

1285
01:44:15,407 --> 01:44:18,649
[SPEAKER_24]: I just found a link early today when I was at my friend's dorm.

1286
01:44:18,689 --> 01:44:19,570
[SPEAKER_24]: We were playing video games.

1287
01:44:19,590 --> 01:44:20,931
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's find out which Target that is.

1288
01:44:21,972 --> 01:44:30,658
[SPEAKER_09]: Just to say something about on the Target website, it says this item will be released on September 22nd and you can pre-order it.

1289
01:44:31,078 --> 01:44:31,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1290
01:44:32,720 --> 01:44:34,101
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just this one story.

1291
01:44:34,301 --> 01:44:37,803
[SPEAKER_04]: Indianapolis, Indiana it looks like is where this person says they live.

1292
01:44:37,883 --> 01:44:42,647
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you are living in the Indianapolis area,

1293
01:44:43,348 --> 01:44:49,569
[SPEAKER_04]: Start calling those targets and see if you can't get your cams on the game because somehow they got a copy of it.

1294
01:44:49,729 --> 01:44:54,450
[SPEAKER_04]: Or it's a really cleverly done Photoshop, but I don't know why this guy would Photoshop it.

1295
01:44:54,470 --> 01:44:59,332
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it could also be like for some whatever reason they got a promo copy and the dumbasses put it out to sell.

1296
01:44:59,432 --> 01:45:01,092
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was like the only copy that they had.

1297
01:45:02,112 --> 01:45:02,872
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never know.

1298
01:45:02,892 --> 01:45:04,493
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, stupid things like that happen.

1299
01:45:04,513 --> 01:45:10,554
[SPEAKER_04]: I noticed that on the receipt here it says the Sony Software...

1300
01:45:11,481 --> 01:45:15,362
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual name of the game is in there, like it's a generic code in there or something.

1301
01:45:15,402 --> 01:45:18,784
[SPEAKER_03]: But does it have what the disk number is?

1302
01:45:18,804 --> 01:45:21,164
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how each disk has an ID number on it?

1303
01:45:21,184 --> 01:45:22,625
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it had a little number on it, I think.

1304
01:45:22,645 --> 01:45:23,245
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the number then?

1305
01:45:23,285 --> 01:45:24,646
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, there's a number there.

1306
01:45:24,746 --> 01:45:25,866
[SPEAKER_03]: Hold on, hold on, let me check.

1307
01:45:26,366 --> 01:45:27,987
[SPEAKER_04]: Ah, what a time for my mouse to be dying.

1308
01:45:28,627 --> 01:45:31,028
[SPEAKER_24]: If I can understand, somebody in California bought it.

1309
01:45:33,729 --> 01:45:35,489
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter anyways, I have the Japanese version.

1310
01:45:35,509 --> 01:45:36,750
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, what do I care?

1311
01:45:39,761 --> 01:45:43,118
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just going to say, I was going to look up here, see if it matches.

1312
01:45:43,259 --> 01:45:44,264
[SPEAKER_03]: We live Katamari.

1313
01:45:46,485 --> 01:45:49,546
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's very interesting if it did come out a little early.

1314
01:45:49,626 --> 01:45:53,649
[SPEAKER_04]: Some folks should just consider themselves lucky and maybe the game will be making its way.

1315
01:45:55,490 --> 01:46:00,732
[SPEAKER_04]: But as far as we know, no official word from Namco or any gaming site for that matter that the game has come out early.

1316
01:46:00,772 --> 01:46:09,097
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would think if the game shipped early, Namco would be shouting it from the mountaintops and all the gaming sites would pick that up because everybody has a boner for Katamari Damashii.

1317
01:46:09,157 --> 01:46:13,179
[SPEAKER_03]: Perfect example, look at... Was it Shane?

1318
01:46:13,259 --> 01:46:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: He got...

1319
01:46:15,271 --> 01:46:18,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone returned Pump It Up to one of the stores and he bought it used.

1320
01:46:18,813 --> 01:46:20,374
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was before the game even came out.

1321
01:46:20,974 --> 01:46:23,095
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so stuff like this happens.

1322
01:46:23,155 --> 01:46:32,441
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, people buy something or get something for free from their distributor or vendor or whatever and they'll return it back to a store and then sell it.

1323
01:46:32,741 --> 01:46:43,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in this case, they might get a promo copy early because I've had a few copies of stuff early before it's treated and someone goes and sells it or mistakenly puts it out on the shelf

1324
01:46:45,011 --> 01:46:45,371
[SPEAKER_03]: Never know.

1325
01:46:45,731 --> 01:46:48,933
[SPEAKER_03]: Or whatever the company is, if they're shipping it in one day.

1326
01:46:52,534 --> 01:46:55,536
[SPEAKER_24]: Because I remember the same thing happened last year with the PS2 minis.

1327
01:46:55,636 --> 01:47:02,659
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I found out that Target put it out three weeks early, and then a week later, Best Buy, we put it out the following week.

1328
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:04,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1329
01:47:05,260 --> 01:47:07,101
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, chat room's bringing up an interesting point.

1330
01:47:07,121 --> 01:47:09,342
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you say your friend got this in California?

1331
01:47:09,362 --> 01:47:09,442
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1332
01:47:10,106 --> 01:47:10,967
[SPEAKER_24]: Mission Viejo San Diego

1333
01:47:28,899 --> 01:47:31,000
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in the San Diego area, it's Mission Viejo.

1334
01:47:31,240 --> 01:47:32,701
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, you can even call the Target.

1335
01:47:33,441 --> 01:47:35,102
[SPEAKER_04]: Should we call the Target and ask if it's in stock?

1336
01:47:36,063 --> 01:47:36,683
[SPEAKER_04]: I should do that.

1337
01:47:36,703 --> 01:47:38,644
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone should link that to me.

1338
01:47:39,104 --> 01:47:40,545
[SPEAKER_04]: We could call them right here on Skype.

1339
01:47:40,685 --> 01:47:42,246
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to call them right now.

1340
01:47:42,286 --> 01:47:42,846
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they open?

1341
01:47:43,626 --> 01:47:44,047
[SPEAKER_04]: No.

1342
01:47:44,067 --> 01:47:45,807
[SPEAKER_24]: Targets don't close until 8 o'clock.

1343
01:47:46,688 --> 01:47:49,109
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you know what?

1344
01:47:49,169 --> 01:47:49,950
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to try calling them.

1345
01:47:50,390 --> 01:47:50,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we?

1346
01:47:51,641 --> 01:47:56,463
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, we're going to call this target and see if they have Weehawk Heart Katamari in stock, okay?

1347
01:47:56,883 --> 01:47:58,604
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've got to let you go in order to do this, okay?

1348
01:47:58,824 --> 01:48:01,065
[SPEAKER_24]: Alright, I'm going to call you back later with some other stuff, so later.

1349
01:48:01,085 --> 01:48:01,806
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later, bye.

1350
01:48:03,527 --> 01:48:04,027
[SPEAKER_04]: We're crazy.

1351
01:48:04,287 --> 01:48:05,988
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, you guys don't talk, just let me do the talking.

1352
01:48:06,008 --> 01:48:07,508
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, switching off the microphone.

1353
01:48:07,568 --> 01:48:08,309
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, here we go.

1354
01:48:11,410 --> 01:48:15,652
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope to God this is the right number and I don't get some freaking... I don't know, we'll see.

1355
01:48:16,493 --> 01:48:19,394
[SPEAKER_04]: Either way, my caller ID's blocked, so that's what's important, right?

1356
01:48:20,967 --> 01:48:23,509
[SPEAKER_04]: We're now calling a Target store, printed on the receipt.

1357
01:48:24,670 --> 01:48:27,613
[SPEAKER_04]: Mission Viejo, California, see if they have We Heart Katamari and stuff.

1358
01:48:28,133 --> 01:48:29,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Damn it, I just picked up another call.

1359
01:48:29,354 --> 01:48:30,876
[SPEAKER_04]: Zach, you gotta call us back in a little bit, okay?

1360
01:48:31,596 --> 01:48:32,317
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, later.

1361
01:48:33,098 --> 01:48:35,340
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still new to Skype.

1362
01:48:35,420 --> 01:48:35,940
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, here we go.

1363
01:48:41,205 --> 01:48:41,946
[SPEAKER_01]: Calling, calling, calling.

1364
01:48:42,026 --> 01:48:42,386
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here we go.

1365
01:48:53,083 --> 01:48:53,884
[SPEAKER_01]: Three Ringy Dingys.

1366
01:48:59,907 --> 01:49:00,728
[SPEAKER_01]: Four Ringy Dingys.

1367
01:49:06,712 --> 01:49:07,612
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody's home at Target.

1368
01:49:11,815 --> 01:49:14,557
[SPEAKER_04]: Apparently the other two busy selling advance copies of We Heart Katamari.

1369
01:49:17,018 --> 01:49:18,259
[SPEAKER_04]: Live radio, ladies and gentlemen.

1370
01:49:22,386 --> 01:49:24,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Someone let Target know their phone's off the hook.

1371
01:49:24,187 --> 01:49:25,148
[SPEAKER_04]: One more ring and then we're hanging up.

1372
01:49:30,051 --> 01:49:30,851
[SPEAKER_04]: Very interesting.

1373
01:49:31,752 --> 01:49:34,273
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only that, but bad customer service.

1374
01:49:35,474 --> 01:49:36,334
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe they're closed.

1375
01:49:36,354 --> 01:49:38,295
[SPEAKER_04]: They could close at 8 on Sunday, I guess.

1376
01:49:39,016 --> 01:49:39,396
[SPEAKER_25]: No.

1377
01:49:39,516 --> 01:49:39,936
[SPEAKER_25]: Interesting.

1378
01:49:41,177 --> 01:49:42,438
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck, they're on to us.

1379
01:49:45,380 --> 01:49:45,740
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1380
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:46,760
[SPEAKER_04]: We called.

1381
01:49:46,900 --> 01:49:47,381
[SPEAKER_04]: No answer.

1382
01:49:47,881 --> 01:49:48,321
[SPEAKER_04]: What can we do?

1383
01:49:48,341 --> 01:49:51,103
[SPEAKER_04]: Sigh.

1384
01:49:54,954 --> 01:49:59,217
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm looking through this one thread that was linked in the chat room.

1385
01:50:00,317 --> 01:50:01,198
[SPEAKER_04]: Are they saying the same thing?

1386
01:50:01,438 --> 01:50:08,662
[SPEAKER_09]: Someone actually had a very good challenge where the guy said post a copy of the... Well, he put up a picture of the disc in the manual.

1387
01:50:09,142 --> 01:50:09,502
[SPEAKER_09]: One second.

1388
01:50:10,383 --> 01:50:10,943
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1389
01:50:11,003 --> 01:50:11,763
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's see what happens.

1390
01:50:11,783 --> 01:50:18,047
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to go to another call real quick here since our brilliant live radio experiment didn't work out very well.

1391
01:50:18,547 --> 01:50:20,848
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because really you could... I don't know.

1392
01:50:21,088 --> 01:50:22,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1393
01:50:22,867 --> 01:50:24,248
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you already know who this is.

1394
01:50:24,488 --> 01:50:24,969
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, Saku.

1395
01:50:24,989 --> 01:50:26,410
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, Target's closed, actually.

1396
01:50:26,730 --> 01:50:27,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1397
01:50:27,210 --> 01:50:27,951
[SPEAKER_04]: I just wanted to share with you.

1398
01:50:27,991 --> 01:50:28,752
[SPEAKER_04]: Target's closed.

1399
01:50:28,792 --> 01:50:32,935
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're about almost 20 minutes late right there.

1400
01:50:33,836 --> 01:50:41,402
[SPEAKER_07]: Well... Had you known this, like, maybe, you know, 20 minutes earlier or probably 30 minutes earlier, you probably would have got through.

1401
01:50:41,682 --> 01:50:45,385
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan, freaking earlier next time.

1402
01:50:46,245 --> 01:50:47,106
[SPEAKER_04]: Beyond time next time.

1403
01:50:47,126 --> 01:50:47,506
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm kidding.

1404
01:50:47,546 --> 01:50:47,847
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fine.

1405
01:50:48,327 --> 01:50:49,228
[SPEAKER_04]: What's on your mind, Saku?

1406
01:50:50,261 --> 01:50:51,283
[SPEAKER_07]: Just calling back.

1407
01:50:51,603 --> 01:50:53,044
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm in school right now.

1408
01:50:54,025 --> 01:50:56,668
[SPEAKER_07]: Moved back on campus a couple of weeks ago.

1409
01:50:58,210 --> 01:50:59,071
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.

1410
01:51:00,332 --> 01:51:03,335
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and I still miss playing in the groove in the city.

1411
01:51:04,437 --> 01:51:08,020
[SPEAKER_07]: I miss that because I'm like 30 miles of stay from the city, so...

1412
01:51:09,304 --> 01:51:10,786
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1413
01:51:23,382 --> 01:51:24,282
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just lazy.

1414
01:51:24,662 --> 01:51:26,363
[SPEAKER_22]: What city is this so we can completely avoid it?

1415
01:51:26,503 --> 01:51:26,983
[SPEAKER_04]: New York.

1416
01:51:27,683 --> 01:51:27,863
[SPEAKER_04]: What?

1417
01:51:28,283 --> 01:51:28,503
[SPEAKER_04]: New York?

1418
01:51:28,523 --> 01:51:29,203
[SPEAKER_04]: City of New York.

1419
01:51:29,264 --> 01:51:30,084
[SPEAKER_04]: City, city, New York?

1420
01:51:30,904 --> 01:51:31,844
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the city of New York.

1421
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:34,445
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought they had it in the groove at Chinatown.

1422
01:51:34,905 --> 01:51:38,346
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, not only that, but in Coney Island, Queens, Staten Island.

1423
01:51:38,566 --> 01:51:39,966
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's starting to spread like cancer.

1424
01:51:41,747 --> 01:51:42,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Interesting analogy.

1425
01:51:43,447 --> 01:51:44,087
[SPEAKER_07]: Lovely thought.

1426
01:51:44,807 --> 01:51:45,108
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1427
01:51:45,348 --> 01:51:47,948
[SPEAKER_07]: That and just missing playing 2DX11 Red.

1428
01:51:47,988 --> 01:51:49,429
[SPEAKER_07]: I just need that fixed.

1429
01:51:49,649 --> 01:51:50,889
[SPEAKER_22]: So it's kind of spreading like New Jersey?

1430
01:51:52,188 --> 01:51:55,171
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it's just... It's reddening like your mama's legs!

1431
01:51:55,652 --> 01:51:56,293
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, burn!

1432
01:51:56,593 --> 01:51:57,975
[SPEAKER_22]: Nah, New Jersey's just the smell.

1433
01:51:58,015 --> 01:51:58,675
[SPEAKER_22]: I was in Philly.

1434
01:51:59,857 --> 01:52:00,177
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1435
01:52:00,738 --> 01:52:03,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what else is on your mind besides lack of Bomani?

1436
01:52:04,472 --> 01:52:07,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, all that new shit that just came out.

1437
01:52:07,035 --> 01:52:09,997
[SPEAKER_06]: All the new info and whatever.

1438
01:52:10,258 --> 01:52:12,099
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm not going to be able to make it to Digital Life.

1439
01:52:12,780 --> 01:52:14,061
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to come.

1440
01:52:14,221 --> 01:52:19,386
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried to schedule my boss, but she had scheduled me for a full week class right there, so I'm not going to be able to do it.

1441
01:52:19,926 --> 01:52:20,907
[SPEAKER_04]: But I hope you guys have fun.

1442
01:52:21,027 --> 01:52:21,548
[SPEAKER_04]: I tried.

1443
01:52:21,648 --> 01:52:23,089
[SPEAKER_04]: I will definitely come next year.

1444
01:52:23,970 --> 01:52:24,511
[SPEAKER_07]: I know, man.

1445
01:52:25,351 --> 01:52:27,093
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I just hope it still happens next year.

1446
01:52:27,927 --> 01:52:28,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so too.

1447
01:52:28,588 --> 01:52:31,810
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we need somebody on the inside taking some pictures and sending them to us.

1448
01:52:31,870 --> 01:52:33,351
[SPEAKER_04]: So, take some pictures over there.

1449
01:52:33,631 --> 01:52:34,952
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I had a digital camera.

1450
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:36,313
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you practicing for your freestyle?

1451
01:52:37,273 --> 01:52:38,434
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, I don't know about that.

1452
01:52:38,454 --> 01:52:39,335
[SPEAKER_07]: I need a job first.

1453
01:52:40,155 --> 01:52:40,255
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

1454
01:52:40,555 --> 01:52:41,636
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm still unemployed.

1455
01:52:41,876 --> 01:52:42,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh.

1456
01:52:43,057 --> 01:52:44,378
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your resume on Monster.

1457
01:52:44,458 --> 01:52:45,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Nine months now.

1458
01:52:45,599 --> 01:52:46,719
[SPEAKER_04]: Get your resume on Monster.

1459
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:47,520
[SPEAKER_04]: And Craigslist.

1460
01:52:47,620 --> 01:52:51,142
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, I've tried that already.

1461
01:52:51,162 --> 01:52:51,803
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude!

1462
01:52:51,923 --> 01:52:56,266
[SPEAKER_07]: When you've been trying to find work for the past nine months, you kind of realize that it's...

1463
01:52:57,213 --> 01:53:01,560
[SPEAKER_07]: There's probably no light at the end of the tunnel.

1464
01:53:01,881 --> 01:53:04,124
[SPEAKER_04]: And to make it worse, I don't even get work study this year.

1465
01:53:04,565 --> 01:53:04,965
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what?

1466
01:53:05,046 --> 01:53:08,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Apply at Target because you'll never have to work past 8 on a Sunday.

1467
01:53:10,754 --> 01:53:12,676
[SPEAKER_04]: And you'll always be home in time for Orange Line.

1468
01:53:13,517 --> 01:53:15,038
[SPEAKER_07]: I just hope so.

1469
01:53:15,078 --> 01:53:18,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope they don't make me work on... I don't know about making me work on weekends.

1470
01:53:18,081 --> 01:53:20,183
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope I can find a job that revolves around my schedule.

1471
01:53:20,343 --> 01:53:23,867
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, there are some employers out there that will work with you if you're in school.

1472
01:53:24,287 --> 01:53:26,970
[SPEAKER_04]: It's possible to find, but you are going to have to kind of look at the bottom.

1473
01:53:27,293 --> 01:53:31,655
[SPEAKER_22]: And a lot of schools also have temporary services where you can actually work on campus.

1474
01:53:32,436 --> 01:53:36,238
[SPEAKER_07]: I've already exhausted those means of working on campus.

1475
01:53:36,298 --> 01:53:38,699
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the jobs are already filled up.

1476
01:53:39,319 --> 01:53:40,780
[SPEAKER_07]: And people want work-study.

1477
01:53:41,200 --> 01:53:43,461
[SPEAKER_07]: Find a nice clock tower.

1478
01:53:44,322 --> 01:53:44,722
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1479
01:53:44,962 --> 01:53:45,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop.

1480
01:53:46,263 --> 01:53:51,225
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's really bad for me because I probably waited almost a week to even find out that I didn't have work-study.

1481
01:53:51,265 --> 01:53:51,305
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1482
01:53:56,243 --> 01:53:57,944
[SPEAKER_07]: As I said, I'm up at Schitt's Creek right now.

1483
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:01,385
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just hoping I get some jobs that I applied to.

1484
01:54:02,686 --> 01:54:04,167
[SPEAKER_07]: And we'll see what happens from there.

1485
01:54:04,347 --> 01:54:05,167
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, good luck to you.

1486
01:54:05,827 --> 01:54:07,848
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that you find something.

1487
01:54:07,868 --> 01:54:13,171
[SPEAKER_04]: Just check with the big, big companies like the Targets, the Walmarts, the Toys R Uses and whatever.

1488
01:54:13,191 --> 01:54:15,432
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, man.

1489
01:54:16,966 --> 01:54:22,950
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, well, have a good one, Zaku, and good luck on the job hunt, and hope you find those Bomani games, okay?

1490
01:54:24,271 --> 01:54:24,571
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1491
01:54:25,231 --> 01:54:25,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Later.

1492
01:54:26,012 --> 01:54:28,893
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

1493
01:54:29,214 --> 01:54:35,718
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now, on the chat room, it sounds like that they actually looked up this target, and the damn store is open.

1494
01:54:36,178 --> 01:54:39,280
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there only one target in Mission Viejo, or is there more than one target?

1495
01:54:41,437 --> 01:54:45,579
[SPEAKER_04]: See, maybe there's more than one Target in the town, so the one you guys are looking up might not be the right one.

1496
01:54:45,599 --> 01:54:47,020
[SPEAKER_04]: But Mission Viejo's not that big, is it?

1497
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:48,000
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it is.

1498
01:54:48,841 --> 01:54:49,201
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't know.

1499
01:54:50,542 --> 01:54:55,644
[SPEAKER_09]: On that one thread, by the way, someone said they worked at Target and got a shipment of it in, so they went ahead and bought us a game.

1500
01:54:56,625 --> 01:54:56,945
[SPEAKER_09]: Really?

1501
01:54:57,765 --> 01:54:59,626
[SPEAKER_09]: They said they got very few copies in.

1502
01:55:00,306 --> 01:55:00,747
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1503
01:55:00,807 --> 01:55:02,087
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, well, here's the correct number.

1504
01:55:02,608 --> 01:55:03,948
[SPEAKER_04]: Did we miss-dial their number?

1505
01:55:03,988 --> 01:55:05,169
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me look at what we dialed last time.

1506
01:55:06,209 --> 01:55:08,871
[SPEAKER_04]: 949... Oh, we totally dialed the wrong number last time.

1507
01:55:08,891 --> 01:55:09,451
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, let's try it again.

1508
01:55:12,369 --> 01:55:13,850
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, now we've got the right target number.

1509
01:55:13,890 --> 01:55:14,431
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, chat room.

1510
01:55:22,717 --> 01:55:25,179
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for calling the Mission Viejo Target Store.

1511
01:55:25,259 --> 01:55:25,600
[SPEAKER_00]: You're welcome.

01:55:25,640 --> 01:55:31,084
[SPEAKER_00]: Our normal store business hours are Monday through Saturday, 8 a.m.

01:55:33,726 --> 01:55:34,967
[SPEAKER_00]: and Sunday, 8 a.m.

01:55:37,608 --> 01:55:44,133
[SPEAKER_00]: PM, we are located on Alicia Parkway off the 5 Freeway between Charlinda and the 5 Freeway.

1517
01:55:44,493 --> 01:55:47,095
[SPEAKER_00]: If you are calling the Target Pharmacy, please press 1.

1518
01:55:47,255 --> 01:55:51,218
[SPEAKER_00]: To speak to the store operator, please wait or press 0.

1519
01:55:54,140 --> 01:55:54,940
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we get the operator.

1520
01:55:59,463 --> 01:56:02,866
[SPEAKER_00]: Please stay on the line while your call is transferred to the operator.

1521
01:56:12,401 --> 01:56:13,161
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, Target.

1522
01:56:13,641 --> 01:56:13,822
[SPEAKER_03]: Ms.

1523
01:56:13,842 --> 01:56:14,562
[SPEAKER_03]: Mayhill, this is Sue.

1524
01:56:14,582 --> 01:56:15,482
[SPEAKER_03]: How can I direct your call?

1525
01:56:15,642 --> 01:56:17,523
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yes, can I speak to somebody in electronics, please?

1526
01:56:18,543 --> 01:56:18,743
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.

1527
01:56:25,406 --> 01:56:25,866
[SPEAKER_17]: Electronics?

1528
01:56:26,346 --> 01:56:29,367
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.

1529
01:56:29,507 --> 01:56:31,128
[SPEAKER_04]: It's We Love Katamari.

1530
01:56:32,408 --> 01:56:32,888
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me check.

1531
01:56:32,908 --> 01:56:33,188
[SPEAKER_17]: Hang on.

1532
01:56:34,549 --> 01:56:35,089
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, SD?

1533
01:56:35,589 --> 01:56:36,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Those are on the next pile.

1534
01:56:36,550 --> 01:56:36,670
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1535
01:56:36,690 --> 01:56:37,310
[SPEAKER_17]: Appreciate it, man.

1536
01:56:37,450 --> 01:56:37,650
Thank you.

1537
01:56:39,761 --> 01:56:40,701
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, what was the game again?

1538
01:56:40,801 --> 01:56:42,642
[SPEAKER_04]: It's We Love Katamari.

1539
01:56:44,563 --> 01:56:45,483
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, we have one left.

1540
01:56:45,883 --> 01:56:46,923
[SPEAKER_04]: You do have one left in stock.

1541
01:56:47,223 --> 01:56:47,643
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we do.

1542
01:56:47,804 --> 01:56:48,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, great, thank you.

1543
01:56:49,884 --> 01:56:50,424
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, bye-bye.

1544
01:56:52,525 --> 01:56:53,425
[SPEAKER_04]: One left, kids!

1545
01:56:53,725 --> 01:56:55,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crap!

1546
01:56:55,246 --> 01:56:56,726
[SPEAKER_04]: Get down there and pick that shit up.

1547
01:56:56,906 --> 01:56:57,747
[SPEAKER_04]: One left in stock.

1548
01:56:58,667 --> 01:57:02,048
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have to talk to my folks at Namco and see what's going on.

1549
01:57:02,827 --> 01:57:05,428
[SPEAKER_03]: Go figure, you heard it here first, boys and girls.

1550
01:57:05,868 --> 01:57:07,909
[SPEAKER_04]: We gonna rat them out, yo.

1551
01:57:08,250 --> 01:57:11,631
[SPEAKER_04]: We freaking called them, and they have one copy left in stock.

1552
01:57:11,651 --> 01:57:13,112
[SPEAKER_04]: You go post that on GameTax right now.

1553
01:57:13,132 --> 01:57:17,554
[SPEAKER_09]: I think I'm gonna make a stop by Target tomorrow after I get out from the chiropractor.

1554
01:57:18,955 --> 01:57:21,176
[SPEAKER_04]: You wanna call the one down up the street here?

1555
01:57:21,936 --> 01:57:22,276
[SPEAKER_09]: Alright.

1556
01:57:25,598 --> 01:57:29,399
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, if they have it, I'm gonna give Neil money to get mine now.

1557
01:57:29,960 --> 01:57:30,300
[SPEAKER_04]: What, are we gonna...

1558
01:57:30,931 --> 01:57:34,033
[SPEAKER_09]: except that I have my non-reserve at GameStop and I can get it for 30% off.

1559
01:57:34,053 --> 01:57:36,674
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we going to call them right now?

1560
01:57:36,694 --> 01:57:40,656
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's 30% off later or full price now.

1561
01:57:40,856 --> 01:57:42,677
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe we're doing this live on air.

1562
01:57:43,878 --> 01:57:45,319
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we'd have better things to talk about.

1563
01:57:46,879 --> 01:57:48,860
[SPEAKER_04]: But damn it, we might get our Katamari fix tonight.

1564
01:57:48,900 --> 01:57:49,601
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, here's the number.

1565
01:57:49,641 --> 01:57:51,082
[SPEAKER_04]: Who has Katamari already?

1566
01:57:51,102 --> 01:57:51,122
[SPEAKER_04]: 638-4971.

1567
01:57:51,142 --> 01:57:52,883
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1568
01:57:58,427 --> 01:58:01,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Bug's going to call him and in the meantime we're going to go to a break.

1569
01:58:02,128 --> 01:58:08,090
[SPEAKER_04]: When we come back from the break we'll let you know what happened and we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio cage match and we've got a couple other Bomani stories for you guys tonight.

1570
01:58:08,451 --> 01:58:09,971
[SPEAKER_04]: So we will be back after this.

1571
01:58:10,471 --> 01:58:13,392
[SPEAKER_04]: Started off with a little bit of the captain, the good captain here.

1572
01:58:14,173 --> 01:58:15,073
[SPEAKER_04]: You're listening to Orange Lounge Radio.

1573
01:58:18,303 --> 01:58:32,545
[SPEAKER_15]: Dreamer Dreamer Take me in your dream Take me anywhere you please Boy, you're making me scream Dreamer Dreamer Life is just a dream If you wanna set me free Boy, you're making me scream Ooh, la, la, la

1574
01:58:58,783 --> 01:59:00,265
Thank you for watching!

1575
01:59:36,827 --> 01:59:38,609
[SPEAKER_15]: You've got a dream of your dream

1576
02:00:04,366 --> 02:00:05,267
Thanks for watching!

1577
02:00:35,891 --> 02:00:36,111
Thank you.

1578
02:01:39,952 --> 02:01:41,573
Thank you for watching!

1579
02:02:18,102 --> 02:02:19,263
Thank you for watching!

1580
02:03:11,684 --> 02:03:14,404
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1581
02:05:03,317 --> 02:05:08,164
[SPEAKER_15]: From Step Squad to Orange Lounge, this PDR sucks!

1582
02:05:08,504 --> 02:05:08,965
[SPEAKER_15]: Holla!

1583
02:05:09,045 --> 02:05:11,929
[SPEAKER_15]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

1584
02:05:20,202 --> 02:05:20,943
[SPEAKER_04]: and the hunt is on.

1585
02:05:50,825 --> 02:05:57,949
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're lucky enough to be in the San Diego, Mission Viejo area, get your ass to Target before 9 o'clock.

1586
02:05:58,589 --> 02:05:59,730
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can thank us later.

1587
02:06:01,771 --> 02:06:02,331
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.

1588
02:06:04,752 --> 02:06:05,132
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1589
02:06:07,073 --> 02:06:08,454
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's sad?

1590
02:06:09,014 --> 02:06:14,237
[SPEAKER_04]: After we cover that on our podcast tonight, that poor store is going to get a shitload of inquiries about the game.

1591
02:06:15,858 --> 02:06:16,578
[SPEAKER_04]: Power of the internet.

1592
02:06:16,598 --> 02:06:17,779
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what's sad also?

1593
02:06:18,919 --> 02:06:19,980
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to rat them out.

1594
02:06:20,569 --> 02:06:21,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't rat him out.

1595
02:06:21,790 --> 02:06:22,650
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, I'm ratting him out.

1596
02:06:22,670 --> 02:06:23,310
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't rat him out.

1597
02:06:23,370 --> 02:06:24,071
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm ratting him out.

1598
02:06:24,091 --> 02:06:27,212
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait until somebody picks up that game, because maybe it'll be good enough to give us an ISO.

1599
02:06:27,232 --> 02:06:28,172
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then they better hurry.

1600
02:06:29,213 --> 02:06:30,253
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to rat him out.

1601
02:06:31,174 --> 02:06:33,195
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, Namco's going to call tomorrow.

1602
02:06:33,875 --> 02:06:34,615
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see what happens.

1603
02:06:35,796 --> 02:06:36,536
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah, I don't care.

1604
02:06:37,817 --> 02:06:43,619
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, what's interesting is that... The only reason I'd be pissed off is because we didn't get ours on time.

1605
02:06:44,019 --> 02:06:47,901
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, you know, it was supposed to come out, you know, I think last week.

1606
02:06:48,779 --> 02:06:49,560
[SPEAKER_03]: and they pushed it back.

1607
02:06:49,700 --> 02:06:50,760
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know what?

1608
02:06:51,281 --> 02:06:52,341
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my bitterness.

1609
02:06:57,584 --> 02:06:57,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1610
02:07:02,326 --> 02:07:04,628
[SPEAKER_04]: The chat room's yelling at us here.

1611
02:07:04,648 --> 02:07:06,509
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if somebody lives in that area or something.

1612
02:07:08,410 --> 02:07:08,690
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1613
02:07:11,571 --> 02:07:11,972
[SPEAKER_04]: Where was I?

1614
02:07:12,012 --> 02:07:14,473
[SPEAKER_04]: I lost track now because of all this We Heart Katamari madness here.

1615
02:07:16,201 --> 02:07:19,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me post that link one more time for you guys looking for that Mission Viejo target.

1616
02:07:19,602 --> 02:07:19,782
Okay.

1617
02:07:21,803 --> 02:07:22,603
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a slight update.

1618
02:07:22,863 --> 02:07:24,023
[SPEAKER_22]: There's one in the area.

1619
02:07:24,644 --> 02:07:27,144
[SPEAKER_22]: They have them, but they aren't putting them out on the shelf until Tuesday.

1620
02:07:27,905 --> 02:07:28,825
[SPEAKER_04]: Until Tuesday?

1621
02:07:28,925 --> 02:07:29,765
[SPEAKER_04]: Until this Tuesday.

1622
02:07:29,845 --> 02:07:30,645
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, who's doing it?

1623
02:07:30,886 --> 02:07:31,786
[SPEAKER_22]: Roseville, the old one.

1624
02:07:32,146 --> 02:07:33,246
[SPEAKER_04]: The old Roseville one.

1625
02:07:33,706 --> 02:07:34,227
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1626
02:07:34,747 --> 02:07:36,407
[SPEAKER_22]: Because there's like two or three in Roseville now.

1627
02:07:37,468 --> 02:07:37,888
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh.

1628
02:07:38,528 --> 02:07:39,788
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one on Douglas Boulevard.

1629
02:07:39,968 --> 02:07:40,208
[SPEAKER_22]: Yep.

1630
02:07:40,568 --> 02:07:41,209
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting.

1631
02:07:41,409 --> 02:07:41,949
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm calling the...

1632
02:07:47,086 --> 02:07:49,268
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's somehow getting out early to targets.

1633
02:07:49,508 --> 02:07:49,708
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1634
02:07:51,249 --> 02:07:54,051
[SPEAKER_09]: Just call the one by my house and they don't... Interesting.

1635
02:07:54,912 --> 02:07:55,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

1636
02:07:56,993 --> 02:07:59,895
[SPEAKER_03]: Just give me some calls made in the morning, let me put it that way.

1637
02:08:00,195 --> 02:08:07,320
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, the other thought is, is that what if Namco is purposefully leaking this out to produce excitement over the game's release?

1638
02:08:07,400 --> 02:08:08,401
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I don't think so.

1639
02:08:08,501 --> 02:08:09,341
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not that smart.

1640
02:08:10,582 --> 02:08:13,324
[SPEAKER_09]: Actually, I worked for Namco and yes, they've done stuff like this in the past.

1641
02:08:13,973 --> 02:08:15,216
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.

1642
02:08:15,317 --> 02:08:15,698
[SPEAKER_03]: I doubt it.

1643
02:08:15,758 --> 02:08:20,370
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is just more of an error in someone's shipping department.

1644
02:08:22,546 --> 02:08:25,468
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the chat room's going, call my target, call my target.

1645
02:08:25,788 --> 02:08:28,370
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, call your own target, seriously.

1646
02:08:28,770 --> 02:08:31,012
[SPEAKER_02]: The hell, we're not calling all your damn targets.

1647
02:08:31,052 --> 02:08:33,393
[SPEAKER_09]: We are not the goddamn operator.

1648
02:08:33,433 --> 02:08:35,095
[SPEAKER_09]: Call your own fucking target.

1649
02:08:35,535 --> 02:08:41,319
[SPEAKER_09]: Pick up your phone, dial the little numbers, and ask them yourself, just like we did with six different stores.

1650
02:08:41,459 --> 02:08:41,879
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.

1651
02:08:43,420 --> 02:08:44,701
[SPEAKER_04]: You see how easy it is?

1652
02:08:45,161 --> 02:08:45,662
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it.

1653
02:08:46,102 --> 02:08:46,722
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it.

1654
02:08:47,563 --> 02:08:49,664
[SPEAKER_09]: The phone is easy to use.

1655
02:08:49,705 --> 02:08:51,546
[SPEAKER_09]: You learn how to do this when you're three.

1656
02:08:53,868 --> 02:08:54,769
[SPEAKER_03]: Hit the button.

1657
02:08:55,209 --> 02:08:57,771
[SPEAKER_09]: If you have that much trouble, get your mommy to call.

1658
02:08:59,452 --> 02:09:02,755
[SPEAKER_03]: You shouldn't be getting this game anyways if you have that much trouble dialing a phone.

1659
02:09:03,095 --> 02:09:07,619
[SPEAKER_09]: You obviously don't have the hand-eye coordination enough to use the controller to play the game.

1660
02:09:09,821 --> 02:09:14,364
[SPEAKER_22]: If you're having trouble using the phone, you've got a serious problem and you probably need help going pee too.

1661
02:09:16,106 --> 02:09:18,127
[SPEAKER_22]: Do you need someone to help you do the wipe?

1662
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,869
[SPEAKER_09]: Or how about the flush?

1663
02:09:20,029 --> 02:09:20,289
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1664
02:09:21,485 --> 02:09:25,809
[SPEAKER_04]: We're getting like a million requests for the clip of the phone call.

1665
02:09:27,358 --> 02:09:29,779
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll, I don't know, put it in the live journal community.

1666
02:09:29,799 --> 02:09:30,099
[SPEAKER_04]: Please.

1667
02:09:30,119 --> 02:09:30,539
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

1668
02:09:31,379 --> 02:09:39,482
[SPEAKER_03]: Post it to our forums, please, because my work firewalled live journals, so I can't do that no more.

1669
02:09:40,462 --> 02:09:40,862
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see.

1670
02:09:40,902 --> 02:09:41,423
[SPEAKER_03]: Shame on them.

1671
02:09:41,503 --> 02:09:42,203
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll see what we can do.

1672
02:09:42,703 --> 02:09:52,566
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I have a certain person I would like to send that to that is certain on certain street dates, and I would like to forward that to them, and that would be hilarious.

1673
02:09:55,067 --> 02:09:55,327
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1674
02:09:56,291 --> 02:09:59,273
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to get into the cage match, but we can't figure out where Loki's song went.

1675
02:09:59,293 --> 02:10:00,374
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a new song for us?

1676
02:10:01,335 --> 02:10:02,196
[SPEAKER_04]: For my cage match?

1677
02:10:02,396 --> 02:10:02,596
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

1678
02:10:02,736 --> 02:10:03,697
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have a new one.

1679
02:10:03,737 --> 02:10:05,318
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't even realize it won last time.

1680
02:10:05,639 --> 02:10:08,041
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically, your song, whatever it was, should have been retired.

1681
02:10:08,401 --> 02:10:10,342
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have a new song that I'm picking.

1682
02:10:10,362 --> 02:10:10,743
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, good.

1683
02:10:10,823 --> 02:10:12,204
[SPEAKER_03]: It's on one of those CDs, actually.

1684
02:10:12,284 --> 02:10:12,584
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, good.

1685
02:10:12,624 --> 02:10:13,005
[SPEAKER_04]: Which one?

1686
02:10:14,566 --> 02:10:16,147
[SPEAKER_04]: The one with the good, cool one.

1687
02:10:17,008 --> 02:10:18,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the one that should be already in there.

1688
02:10:19,270 --> 02:10:19,610
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1689
02:10:20,250 --> 02:10:22,572
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually on both of them, so it doesn't really matter.

1690
02:10:22,732 --> 02:10:23,373
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, sounds good.

1691
02:10:23,945 --> 02:10:26,347
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1692
02:10:26,367 --> 02:10:29,590
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting fresh this week because we did go two weeks without a show.

1693
02:10:30,471 --> 02:10:33,393
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just going to go ahead and kind of restart tonight with the cage match.

1694
02:10:34,774 --> 02:10:37,817
[SPEAKER_04]: And it goes a little something like this.

1695
02:10:42,260 --> 02:10:42,641
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1696
02:10:42,661 --> 02:10:42,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1697
02:10:43,979 --> 02:10:44,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's the deal.

1698
02:10:45,200 --> 02:10:48,323
[SPEAKER_04]: Join our chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1699
02:10:48,343 --> 02:10:51,887
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to play three songs for you guys, and you guys get to pick your favorite.

1700
02:10:52,247 --> 02:11:03,178
[SPEAKER_04]: And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bobani and Video Game Music Show, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we are not live.

1701
02:11:03,942 --> 02:11:07,124
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off with three brand new songs tonight for you to pick from.

1702
02:11:07,144 --> 02:11:08,865
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no reigning champion.

1703
02:11:09,325 --> 02:11:14,208
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start off tonight with DarkSakura's pick, since she's the only one that has her pick up and ready to go.

1704
02:11:14,228 --> 02:11:15,949
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to start off with her.

1705
02:11:16,029 --> 02:11:17,310
[SPEAKER_09]: I had it ready last week.

1706
02:11:17,590 --> 02:11:19,291
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, we won't talk about last week.

1707
02:11:19,672 --> 02:11:22,213
[SPEAKER_04]: So what did you pick for us, DarkSakura?

1708
02:11:22,373 --> 02:11:25,255
[SPEAKER_09]: It's by a Czech group called Accent.

1709
02:11:25,615 --> 02:11:25,936
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry.

1710
02:11:26,356 --> 02:11:31,759
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is a really weird video with a lookalike like Kylie Minogue in it, and these guys kept making out with her.

1711
02:11:32,259 --> 02:11:33,040
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's called Kylie.

1712
02:11:34,298 --> 02:11:34,618
[SPEAKER_04]: AXS with Kylie

1713
02:13:06,750 --> 02:13:32,150
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car Heidi, give me just a chance, let's go out and dance We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car

1714
02:14:04,630 --> 02:14:20,648
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sure you have seen me, I'm dreaming about you every night, every night Kylie give me just a chance, let's go out and dance, we can get into the groove, I can watch you

1715
02:14:33,143 --> 02:14:57,323
[SPEAKER_13]: We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me, like a shining star But I rather, know you on the backseat of my car You drive me crazy, you slowly drive me crazy That bloody baby, can't get you off my mind I should be lucky, I should be so lucky I should be lucky, to see you

1716
02:15:24,975 --> 02:15:50,383
[SPEAKER_15]: We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car Kylie give me just a chance, let's go out and dance We can get into the groove, I can watch you move Later you can sing to me like a shining star But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car

1717
02:16:03,117 --> 02:16:07,159
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Accent with Kylie.

1718
02:16:07,179 --> 02:16:10,341
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with DarkSakura.

1719
02:16:10,641 --> 02:16:11,662
[SPEAKER_04]: That song is great.

1720
02:16:12,122 --> 02:16:16,644
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the style's kind of, you know, an older style, but the song's relatively new.

1721
02:16:17,365 --> 02:16:19,486
[SPEAKER_09]: And the video's freaking hilarious, so it gets a 9.5.

1722
02:16:19,746 --> 02:16:20,186
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1723
02:16:21,167 --> 02:16:24,329
[SPEAKER_03]: Kind of reminds me of Eiffel 65 a little bit.

1724
02:16:25,709 --> 02:16:27,130
[SPEAKER_03]: But I like it.

1725
02:16:27,150 --> 02:16:27,530
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny.

1726
02:16:28,031 --> 02:16:28,191
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight.

1727
02:16:30,132 --> 02:16:30,392
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugs.

1728
02:16:31,243 --> 02:16:33,765
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, it sounds a lot like the Numa Numa song.

1729
02:16:36,067 --> 02:16:36,628
[SPEAKER_04]: A little bit.

1730
02:16:36,888 --> 02:16:37,509
[SPEAKER_04]: Scale of 1 to 10?

1731
02:16:39,510 --> 02:16:39,871
[SPEAKER_04]: 8 and a half.

1732
02:16:41,913 --> 02:16:47,157
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to agree with Arcadian42 in our chatroom, who said this song is fruity.

1733
02:16:48,459 --> 02:16:50,761
[SPEAKER_04]: However, for that reason, I loved it.

1734
02:16:50,801 --> 02:16:51,361
[SPEAKER_04]: It was great.

1735
02:16:51,401 --> 02:16:53,283
[SPEAKER_04]: It was a great cage match song, honestly.

1736
02:16:53,323 --> 02:16:54,544
[SPEAKER_04]: It was funny and it was dancey.

1737
02:16:54,764 --> 02:16:55,145
[SPEAKER_04]: 9 and a half.

1738
02:16:55,345 --> 02:16:57,146
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm putting the video in the chatroom, by the way.

1739
02:16:57,226 --> 02:16:57,547
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1740
02:16:58,393 --> 02:17:00,574
[SPEAKER_04]: But there are still two more songs to go.

1741
02:17:00,854 --> 02:17:01,274
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows?

1742
02:17:01,334 --> 02:17:02,494
[SPEAKER_04]: We may have something a little better.

1743
02:17:02,654 --> 02:17:03,335
[SPEAKER_04]: We will find out.

1744
02:17:03,495 --> 02:17:04,155
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your call.

1745
02:17:04,535 --> 02:17:05,775
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number two is Loki's pick.

1746
02:17:05,795 --> 02:17:06,696
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you pick for us, Loki?

1747
02:17:06,936 --> 02:17:08,857
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm off the Good Cool Expander CD.

1748
02:17:10,077 --> 02:17:16,779
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really like Eurobeat, and this is a trance remix of Blame by Good Cool.

1749
02:17:17,659 --> 02:17:18,000
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1750
02:17:19,320 --> 02:17:21,981
[SPEAKER_04]: Here it is, Blame, the trance mix by Good Cool.

1751
02:17:46,036 --> 02:17:53,148
No more your memory will last Deep within my mind I will always find you

1752
02:19:40,248 --> 02:19:43,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Deep within my mind I would always find emotions still alive

1753
02:21:25,555 --> 02:21:27,133
[SPEAKER_15]: You've only got yourself to blame

1754
02:22:03,147 --> 02:22:04,188
DarkSakura.com

1755
02:22:29,861 --> 02:22:34,923
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounded like Eurobeat with extra different... Eurobeat with different synths.

1756
02:22:35,664 --> 02:22:37,825
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, it was okay.

1757
02:22:38,245 --> 02:22:41,306
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I really like Blaine, but I actually like the Eurobeat version better.

1758
02:22:42,007 --> 02:22:43,087
[SPEAKER_09]: So it gets a 7.5.

1759
02:22:43,407 --> 02:22:43,647
[SPEAKER_09]: Loki.

1760
02:22:43,667 --> 02:22:48,950
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a 9 because I've been blasting this in my car with the windows down driving.

1761
02:22:49,370 --> 02:22:49,790
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fun.

1762
02:22:50,430 --> 02:22:50,690
[SPEAKER_03]: Bug.

1763
02:22:50,710 --> 02:22:52,831
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give it a 6.

1764
02:22:52,911 --> 02:22:54,012
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like more of the same.

1765
02:22:56,003 --> 02:22:56,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I kind of liked it.

1766
02:22:56,884 --> 02:22:59,405
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't like it as much as the Kylie song, but I kind of dug it.

1767
02:22:59,425 --> 02:23:00,106
[SPEAKER_04]: It was pretty cool.

1768
02:23:00,246 --> 02:23:01,086
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll give it an eight and a half.

1769
02:23:01,967 --> 02:23:02,287
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1770
02:23:02,947 --> 02:23:04,128
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving on to song number three.

1771
02:23:04,208 --> 02:23:05,609
[SPEAKER_04]: Boy, am I feeling the pressure tonight.

1772
02:23:05,749 --> 02:23:08,350
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm pretty much conceding tonight's cage match.

1773
02:23:08,390 --> 02:23:08,870
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.

1774
02:23:09,311 --> 02:23:11,492
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to do a song where I don't care if you vote for it or not.

1775
02:23:12,762 --> 02:23:23,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Because you might remember a couple weeks ago before we went on involuntary hiatus, I played a song called Why by DJ Sammy, which didn't get a single vote from any of you.

1776
02:23:23,992 --> 02:23:27,956
[SPEAKER_04]: So I said, F you all, the next cage match, I'm going to play something shitty.

1777
02:23:28,536 --> 02:23:29,197
[SPEAKER_04]: So here it is.

1778
02:23:30,319 --> 02:23:45,027
[SPEAKER_04]: The band is M3 Helena Walsh and Stacey D. I have no idea what kind of name that is, but it's M3 Helena Walsh and Stacey D. It's called I Touch Myself, the Love to Infinity radio mix.

1779
02:23:45,127 --> 02:23:47,648
[SPEAKER_04]: And yes, it is an update of that song.

1780
02:23:48,609 --> 02:23:49,129
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three.

1781
02:26:26,738 --> 02:26:32,866
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want you, I don't want anybody else When I think about you, I touch myself

1782
02:27:26,952 --> 02:27:27,573
[SPEAKER_04]: All righty.

1783
02:27:28,033 --> 02:27:31,255
[SPEAKER_04]: That was song number three in tonight's cage match.

1784
02:27:31,715 --> 02:27:32,235
[SPEAKER_04]: Where's my background?

1785
02:27:32,335 --> 02:27:32,655
[SPEAKER_04]: There we go.

1786
02:27:33,076 --> 02:27:41,200
[SPEAKER_04]: Song number three in tonight's cage match, I Touch Myself by M3, Helena Walsh, and Stacey D. I touched myself right in the eye.

1787
02:27:41,560 --> 02:27:43,181
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what'd you think?

1788
02:27:43,961 --> 02:27:52,225
[SPEAKER_09]: I wanted to cry because they took a song that was excellent in its original form and made it into just generic trance crap.

1789
02:27:52,706 --> 02:27:53,646
[SPEAKER_09]: So it gets a three.

1790
02:27:54,987 --> 02:27:55,227
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki!

1791
02:27:56,488 --> 02:27:57,949
[SPEAKER_03]: It's remixed by numbers.

1792
02:27:59,510 --> 02:28:03,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Take song, add different backbeat, done.

1793
02:28:04,152 --> 02:28:04,773
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like it.

1794
02:28:05,013 --> 02:28:11,997
[SPEAKER_03]: It made me... It was like that song was the whole, and seven days later I'm going to become gay having listened to that song.

1795
02:28:13,137 --> 02:28:14,678
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think it's a six.

1796
02:28:15,239 --> 02:28:15,619
[SPEAKER_22]: Bugged.

1797
02:28:17,020 --> 02:28:20,902
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I touched myself in the eye and then the nose, and... Yeah.

1798
02:28:21,962 --> 02:28:22,243
[SPEAKER_04]: Two.

1799
02:28:22,623 --> 02:28:22,943
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

1800
02:28:23,797 --> 02:28:24,398
[SPEAKER_04]: I do not need that imagery!

1801
02:28:53,032 --> 02:28:58,136
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Good Cool with Chorus K with Blame the Transmix.

1802
02:29:10,443 --> 02:29:13,045
[SPEAKER_04]: And song number three you can vote for tonight, I Touch Myself.

1803
02:29:23,980 --> 02:29:24,861
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, kids.

1804
02:29:25,201 --> 02:29:27,522
[SPEAKER_04]: Place vote now.

1805
02:29:27,622 --> 02:29:31,504
[SPEAKER_04]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1806
02:29:32,084 --> 02:29:33,205
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to play this song now.

1807
02:29:33,765 --> 02:29:34,345
[SPEAKER_04]: What song is this?

1808
02:29:35,065 --> 02:29:36,506
[SPEAKER_03]: The V-Rare stuff.

1809
02:29:36,926 --> 02:29:37,967
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we'll get to the V-Rare.

1810
02:29:38,687 --> 02:29:41,188
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I found that song that I was talking to you about.

1811
02:29:41,208 --> 02:29:45,851
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember when we were sitting at E3 and we're watching, you know, the Groovaloos do their thing up there in that song?

1812
02:29:45,871 --> 02:29:48,092
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, that would be an awesome song to remix with...

1813
02:29:49,002 --> 02:29:49,442
[SPEAKER_03]: No Limit

1814
02:30:12,540 --> 02:30:14,641
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of waiting is what's going on in the sim scene.

1815
02:30:14,681 --> 02:30:16,422
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for a few things.

1816
02:30:16,482 --> 02:30:18,383
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for Bomani Sale to come back up.

1817
02:30:18,563 --> 02:30:23,646
[SPEAKER_03]: We're waiting for Food Mix 2 to be released next week.

1818
02:30:23,986 --> 02:30:25,207
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out Friday, folks.

1819
02:30:25,467 --> 02:30:27,388
[SPEAKER_03]: Only a few more days left on the 15th.

1820
02:30:28,429 --> 02:30:32,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So keep an eye on Orange Ones Radio because we'll let you know when it's up and what we think about it.

1821
02:30:33,752 --> 02:30:40,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're also waiting to see what's going on with DDR East Coast Invasion because

1822
02:30:41,430 --> 02:30:42,630
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still doing tournaments.

1823
02:30:43,120 --> 02:30:45,841
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1824
02:31:13,755 --> 02:31:14,156
[SPEAKER_03]: FoonMix 2

1825
02:31:26,548 --> 02:31:27,529
[SPEAKER_04]: Dream Mix TV World Fighters

1826
02:31:53,976 --> 02:32:02,424
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it is, it's a collection of characters from Konami, from Hudson Soft, and one other company.

1827
02:32:02,464 --> 02:32:05,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the last company, but it is Super Smash Bros.

1828
02:32:05,968 --> 02:32:06,288
[SPEAKER_03]: with us.

1829
02:32:06,408 --> 02:32:10,632
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you get some really crazy matchups from Konami, for example.

1830
02:32:10,932 --> 02:32:12,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Starting off, they have Simon Belmont.

1831
02:32:12,814 --> 02:32:14,676
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Solid Snake.

1832
02:32:15,297 --> 02:32:16,037
[SPEAKER_03]: That was unlockable.

1833
02:32:16,077 --> 02:32:16,818
[SPEAKER_03]: Solid Snake.

1834
02:32:17,419 --> 02:32:18,620
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Twinbee.

1835
02:32:19,344 --> 02:32:20,025
[SPEAKER_03]: The Bathroom Yell

1836
02:32:38,392 --> 02:32:39,693
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they have Bomberman.

1837
02:32:40,033 --> 02:32:43,635
[SPEAKER_03]: They had like some Barbie type chick or something like that.

1838
02:32:44,495 --> 02:32:48,116
[SPEAKER_03]: They had, I want to say... Optimus Prime, bitch!

1839
02:32:48,236 --> 02:32:49,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Optimus Prime, motherfucker!

1840
02:32:50,197 --> 02:32:50,738
Bomberman!

1841
02:32:50,838 --> 02:32:51,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Bomberman was in it.

1842
02:32:51,698 --> 02:32:53,319
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played this game, DarkSakura?

1843
02:32:54,019 --> 02:32:54,659
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you played this game?

1844
02:32:55,560 --> 02:32:58,101
[SPEAKER_09]: Goddamn, all I heard was Hudson Soft and I think Bomberman.

1845
02:32:58,241 --> 02:33:01,362
[SPEAKER_04]: A Super Smash Brothers rip-off, well, clone-ish game.

1846
02:33:01,741 --> 02:33:04,864
[SPEAKER_04]: with Konami characters and Hudson characters and Optimus Prime.

1847
02:33:05,305 --> 02:33:05,925
[SPEAKER_09]: On what?

1848
02:33:06,245 --> 02:33:06,606
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2.

1849
02:33:06,646 --> 02:33:07,607
[SPEAKER_04]: PlayStation 2 Japanese.

1850
02:33:07,947 --> 02:33:08,768
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it out when?

1851
02:33:08,988 --> 02:33:09,489
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already out.

1852
02:33:09,829 --> 02:33:10,410
[SPEAKER_09]: Ordering right now.

1853
02:33:11,110 --> 02:33:12,191
[SPEAKER_03]: I have it on my PlayStation.

1854
02:33:12,211 --> 02:33:12,772
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got to play it.

1855
02:33:13,052 --> 02:33:19,959
[SPEAKER_03]: We did a matchup with Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime, who, by the way, turns into a truck.

1856
02:33:19,979 --> 02:33:24,543
[SPEAKER_04]: That was great, watching Optimus Prime turn into a truck and beat people, run people over.

1857
02:33:24,563 --> 02:33:25,524
[SPEAKER_03]: They have characters from...

1858
02:33:26,770 --> 02:33:38,801
[SPEAKER_03]: Bloody Roar Adventure Island Master Higgins It's not as good as Smash Bros.

1859
02:33:39,162 --> 02:33:40,283
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as good as Smash Bros.

1860
02:33:40,323 --> 02:33:41,444
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's still pretty damn fun.

1861
02:33:41,984 --> 02:33:42,865
[SPEAKER_03]: I had fun playing it.

1862
02:33:43,105 --> 02:33:44,086
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's very Japanese.

1863
02:33:44,366 --> 02:33:45,928
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very Japanese.

1864
02:33:46,368 --> 02:33:47,169
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's

1865
02:33:47,594 --> 02:33:48,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Too much of a culture shock thing.

1866
02:34:14,096 --> 02:34:15,117
[SPEAKER_22]: and then it was, where's Jamie?

1867
02:34:16,618 --> 02:34:19,240
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry, I was in the bathroom, thank you.

1868
02:34:19,280 --> 02:34:20,861
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not now, before the show.

1869
02:34:20,921 --> 02:34:23,023
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I walked back here and then suddenly the front door opened.

1870
02:34:23,103 --> 02:34:24,884
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, speak of the devil, literally.

1871
02:34:25,885 --> 02:34:26,225
[SPEAKER_04]: Kisses.

1872
02:34:26,886 --> 02:34:27,206
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1873
02:34:28,327 --> 02:34:29,728
[SPEAKER_09]: I was there too before I came here.

1874
02:34:30,289 --> 02:34:33,671
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, we're going to tally up those cage match votes right now and we're going to take a break.

1875
02:34:33,851 --> 02:34:38,815
[SPEAKER_04]: In this break, DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare music.

1876
02:34:38,875 --> 02:34:40,056
[SPEAKER_04]: We got it, here it is.

1877
02:34:40,076 --> 02:34:41,137
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hear it in this break.

1878
02:34:42,478 --> 02:34:47,721
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of the shorter songs from... Was that NCSX sold out on Mario Mix?

1879
02:34:47,901 --> 02:34:50,583
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, DDR Mario Mix sold out on NCSX.

1880
02:34:52,164 --> 02:34:52,964
[SPEAKER_09]: Diet Channel?

1881
02:34:53,785 --> 02:34:54,265
[SPEAKER_04]: Here we go.

1882
02:34:54,605 --> 02:34:58,488
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to hear in this break, because we picked some of the shorter songs, because we're not going to be able to play the whole thing.

1883
02:34:58,868 --> 02:35:02,350
[SPEAKER_04]: You Gotta Move It, which is the new song that's going to be playable.

1884
02:35:02,450 --> 02:35:03,351
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very sexy.

1885
02:35:04,291 --> 02:35:05,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Destiny, the piano version.

1886
02:35:06,473 --> 02:35:08,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I Need You, the inside-out outdoor mix.

1887
02:35:09,234 --> 02:35:11,015
[SPEAKER_04]: And Infinite Prayer, all in this break.

1888
02:35:11,416 --> 02:35:11,976
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll be back.

1889
02:35:12,495 --> 02:35:12,735
[SPEAKER_04]: Enjoy!

1890
02:36:43,090 --> 02:36:47,551
[SPEAKER_15]: Let the music fill your cell Let your body take control Falling, my whole world is falling

1891
02:37:08,502 --> 02:37:10,163

1893
02:38:07,780 --> 02:38:29,610
[SPEAKER_15]: I could keep on following you, never letting you go Following you, losing all my pride Callin' on you and never letting you go Following you, but you'd run You, you were the destiny I was planning for eternity

1894
02:38:33,392 --> 02:38:51,363
[SPEAKER_18]: Something came and took you away from me Baby, you, you were my destiny You were the only man in this world for me, meant for me But now you've brought away destiny

1895
02:39:36,800 --> 02:39:52,235
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm not talking happiness, I know you must be aware that the lies I tell you doesn't matter when it's all together And you don't have to wait for me to let you go I'm with you, with you, I'm with you all the time, all the time

1896
02:40:46,973 --> 02:40:48,474
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

1897
02:41:52,651 --> 02:41:53,291
Thanks for watching!

1898
02:42:53,775 --> 02:43:02,301
[SPEAKER_25]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

1899
02:43:02,441 --> 02:43:03,782
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1900
02:43:06,164 --> 02:43:09,487
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello boys and girls, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

1901
02:43:11,568 --> 02:43:17,152
[SPEAKER_04]: I almost want to call that Target store back tomorrow morning and see if that coffee got sold or somebody went and slapped him on the wrist or what.

1902
02:43:17,773 --> 02:43:18,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see.

1903
02:43:18,573 --> 02:43:19,234
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out there now.

1904
02:43:20,259 --> 02:43:45,233
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, in that break, some music from the DDR Extreme 2 VRare, You Gotta Move It, featuring Julie Regard, I think it is, Destiny, Piano Version, I Need You, Inside Out, Dormix, and Infinite Prayer, all from the new VRare, which, by the way, I tried to get at a GameStop yesterday, or I should really say Miklatov tried to get at a GameStop yesterday, which I don't really get, because, you know, he kind of works for Konami, and he doesn't have a copy of the VRare yet, but we were trying to get one from GameStop, and couldn't get one.

1905
02:43:46,426 --> 02:43:47,829
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the weird thing, though.

1906
02:43:48,009 --> 02:43:49,853
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't gotten one yet.

1907
02:43:50,233 --> 02:43:50,955
[SPEAKER_04]: No, this is the weird thing.

1908
02:43:51,215 --> 02:43:53,840
[SPEAKER_04]: They said they had given some out, but they thought they had one left.

1909
02:43:53,980 --> 02:43:55,924
[SPEAKER_04]: They had the cover and no disc in it.

1910
02:43:56,829 --> 02:43:57,670
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1911
02:44:18,602 --> 02:44:21,805
[SPEAKER_04]: or just wanted to hear it, haven't gotten your viewers yet.

1912
02:44:21,845 --> 02:44:22,905
[SPEAKER_04]: Those were some of the tracks.

1913
02:44:23,686 --> 02:44:28,149
[SPEAKER_04]: Other tracks, some repeats from previous games you've probably already heard before on the station.

1914
02:44:28,750 --> 02:44:35,054
[SPEAKER_04]: Some other long version mixes, but we just don't have time to play those because they're like 7 or 8 minutes.

1915
02:44:36,295 --> 02:44:37,916
[SPEAKER_03]: We can play the Seduction vocal mix, it's only 4.40.

1916
02:44:39,017 --> 02:44:46,262
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we'll get to that if we have time, but we're running a little late in show actually because usually we get to the FUs of the week around 8.30 and frickin' now it's 9.15.

1917
02:44:48,882 --> 02:44:49,042
[SPEAKER_04]: Rage!

1918
02:45:12,252 --> 02:45:18,074
[SPEAKER_09]: My first FU of the week goes toward sleeping for 12 hours and waking up sick.

1919
02:45:20,695 --> 02:45:24,436
[SPEAKER_09]: Also another FU goes to Battletech because it makes me motion sick.

1920
02:45:25,276 --> 02:45:26,817
[SPEAKER_09]: Another FU goes toward...

1921
02:45:30,715 --> 02:45:35,179
[SPEAKER_09]: I actually have something I can't say on the air, so just a generic F you towards something that's stuck in my head.

1922
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:41,384
[SPEAKER_09]: And another one goes toward being sick, again, and having to go to work.

1923
02:45:42,105 --> 02:45:42,525
[SPEAKER_09]: That's it.

1924
02:45:44,266 --> 02:45:45,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, Loki's turn.

1925
02:45:45,507 --> 02:45:46,328
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, one more.

1926
02:45:47,269 --> 02:45:48,930
[SPEAKER_09]: F you to World Geography, thank you.

1927
02:45:49,911 --> 02:45:51,572
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, let's go to Loki.

1928
02:45:51,653 --> 02:45:51,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki.

1929
02:45:52,885 --> 02:46:07,861
[SPEAKER_03]: I have one that's stuck in my mind, and that's basically, fuck you to the firewall that's at my work, because now I can't view a lot of sites because they're, you know, under different, like, logs, you know, like, spam or chat or whatever.

1930
02:46:08,261 --> 02:46:12,145
[SPEAKER_03]: At one point we had, like, almost the whole internet blocked because they were messing with the filters.

1931
02:46:12,185 --> 02:46:13,066
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys use WebSense?

1932
02:46:13,706 --> 02:46:18,810
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they have this Barracuda spy blocker thing, or Barracuda firewall or something.

1933
02:46:19,230 --> 02:46:22,212
[SPEAKER_03]: That sucker, you know, it doesn't like proxy servers either.

1934
02:46:22,232 --> 02:46:25,115
[SPEAKER_03]: I tried getting around it that way, but no luck.

1935
02:46:25,435 --> 02:46:30,739
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, yeah, but fuck that, because now I can't read stuff on LiveJournal, and it cuts down one more page I can read.

1936
02:46:31,368 --> 02:46:33,730
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome to the world that the rest of us have to live in at work.

1937
02:47:01,739 --> 02:47:05,560
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to give an F you to vacation being over, because I don't want it to end.

1938
02:47:08,081 --> 02:47:11,541
[SPEAKER_04]: So an F you to the fact that vacation's running out and I actually have to go back to work tomorrow, that sucks.

1939
02:47:13,102 --> 02:47:16,523
[SPEAKER_04]: And an F you to GameStop that didn't have the copy of the beer I ran yesterday, because I wanted that.

1940
02:47:17,283 --> 02:47:23,504
[SPEAKER_04]: And an F you to the fact that the systems at Dave & Buster's went down for a little while yesterday, which took away from my precious playtime.

1941
02:47:24,865 --> 02:47:30,046
[SPEAKER_04]: An F you to the fact that I can't stop eating Cold Stone, because that ice cream is delicious, and it makes me fat.

1942
02:47:31,634 --> 02:47:35,957
[SPEAKER_04]: and an F you to that guy in Final Fantasy XI who called me a cheap white mage because I don't have a race.

1943
02:47:36,438 --> 02:47:39,900
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you, I've tried to do BCNM40 I don't know how many times, I can't get that damn scroll.

1944
02:47:40,221 --> 02:47:42,682
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't win it for my life, so... F you!

1945
02:47:42,863 --> 02:47:43,983
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate you, no cures for you.

1946
02:47:45,464 --> 02:47:47,846
[SPEAKER_04]: I like being a white mage because if I don't like somebody, I'll let them die.

1947
02:47:49,828 --> 02:47:51,509
[SPEAKER_04]: And let's go- oops, I'm sorry, lag, huh?

1948
02:47:53,050 --> 02:47:55,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go to Bugged with any F yous he might have.

1949
02:47:56,192 --> 02:47:58,114
[SPEAKER_22]: F you to your Comcast DVR.

1950
02:47:59,395 --> 02:47:59,595
[SPEAKER_22]: Why?

1951
02:48:00,603 --> 02:48:02,324
[SPEAKER_22]: It doesn't work like a TiVo.

1952
02:48:03,005 --> 02:48:04,606
[SPEAKER_22]: I told you it's not as good as TiVo.

1953
02:48:04,646 --> 02:48:05,346
[SPEAKER_22]: Good God.

1954
02:48:06,447 --> 02:48:08,408
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought you meant it didn't record suggestions.

1955
02:48:08,468 --> 02:48:09,969
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't know it wouldn't go back.

1956
02:48:11,490 --> 02:48:14,932
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, and also since I haven't been on the show in a while, I left you to breaking my collarbone.

1957
02:48:17,574 --> 02:48:18,754
[SPEAKER_09]: Glad to see you up and about.

1958
02:48:19,575 --> 02:48:27,680
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, Rob saw me, what, a couple of days afterward at a party, and I pretty much sat in a chair and vegged out, drank a lot of beer, and...

1959
02:48:28,872 --> 02:48:32,254
[SPEAKER_22]: And we all laughed at pictures of ourselves from junior high and high school.

1960
02:48:32,614 --> 02:48:33,575
[SPEAKER_04]: No, mostly just mine.

1961
02:48:34,475 --> 02:48:36,396
[SPEAKER_04]: And Brian's, but that's because he wasn't there.

1962
02:48:39,378 --> 02:48:46,321
[SPEAKER_22]: Let's see, oh, FQ to the ER, but... Because when I broke my collarbone, I had to go to the ER.

1963
02:48:46,421 --> 02:48:52,504
[SPEAKER_22]: I am unemployed, I do not have insurance, and it was actually a lot less than I thought it would be, but the fact that I didn't have insurance sucked.

1964
02:48:52,865 --> 02:48:55,326
[SPEAKER_22]: Next time I fall and break my collarbone, I'm going to try and do it in Canada.

1965
02:48:57,312 --> 02:48:58,653
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, I've got a plan on that.

1966
02:49:00,234 --> 02:49:02,294
[SPEAKER_22]: Put it on the itinerary for next time I go up to Vancouver.

1967
02:49:02,334 --> 02:49:04,255
[SPEAKER_22]: Fall off bike, break collarbone.

1968
02:49:08,357 --> 02:49:09,278
[SPEAKER_22]: Not many other FUs.

1969
02:49:10,198 --> 02:49:10,538
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright.

1970
02:49:12,699 --> 02:49:14,680
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow, that music was too happy for an FU, I'm sorry.

1971
02:49:18,062 --> 02:49:18,802
[SPEAKER_04]: Chatroom FU time.

1972
02:49:19,755 --> 02:49:30,079
[SPEAKER_04]: Sakurina says, F you to rain, the public transportation that isn't on time, trains and all of that happening on the same day, causing me to walk home from school in the rain and staying stuck there due to a train crossing.

1973
02:49:31,459 --> 02:49:35,221
[SPEAKER_04]: Tomokun would like to say, fuck life 365, fuck, fuck, fuck idiots.

1974
02:49:35,841 --> 02:49:47,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, let's see, Dark Knight would like to say, my F you goes to my Advance Wars DS game for being hard as hell, and an F you to loneliness, no one in the world deserves to be all alone in the world.

1975
02:49:47,065 --> 02:49:47,305
[SPEAKER_04]: Aw.

1976
02:49:49,329 --> 02:50:16,322
[SPEAKER_04]: SpiritSnare says F you to Tokyo Game Action for getting Happy Sky F you to certain Target stores for releasing We Heart Katamari earlier than they're supposed to F you to others for not Not Google, but Goggle says F you to Lowe's Cineplex in Danbury, Connecticut for not letting me into an R-rated movie Also F you to school starting at 7.45 every morning I think I've been to that theater in Connecticut Go figure, I've been to a lot of really random places

1977
02:50:17,548 --> 02:50:20,469
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkTetsuya says, A continued FU to this crappy connection.

1978
02:50:20,849 --> 02:50:22,590
[SPEAKER_04]: An FU to CCL's card system.

1979
02:50:22,650 --> 02:50:25,490
[SPEAKER_04]: No one explained that the cards expire, so I had to find out the hard way.

1980
02:50:26,551 --> 02:50:28,571
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I read that in your LJ and I was pissed too.

1981
02:50:29,511 --> 02:50:33,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Rini would like to say, I have an FU to diarrhea or indigestion.

1982
02:50:35,153 --> 02:50:44,936
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in the 155 episodes we've done of Orange Lounge Radio, you think that's something someone would have said FU to a long time ago because...

1983
02:50:47,818 --> 02:50:49,379
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't flat out say diarrhea.

1984
02:50:50,819 --> 02:50:55,240
[SPEAKER_09]: You did say indigestion, but... No, F you to the medication the doctor puts you on.

1985
02:50:55,960 --> 02:51:03,401
[SPEAKER_03]: I have done an F you, though, to drinking a lot of Hawaiian Punch and coloring my feces blue.

1986
02:51:04,702 --> 02:51:06,742
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that kind of tops that one.

1987
02:51:07,782 --> 02:51:10,983
[SPEAKER_09]: If you eat asparagus, it turns your pee a different color, too.

1988
02:51:12,263 --> 02:51:15,544
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have honey smacks, it makes your pee smell like honey smacks.

1989
02:51:16,004 --> 02:51:16,384
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you know?

1990
02:51:16,997 --> 02:51:19,601
[SPEAKER_09]: That sounds incredibly nasty in both cases.

1991
02:51:20,642 --> 02:51:22,364
[SPEAKER_22]: First off, why are you sniffing your pee?

1992
02:51:23,666 --> 02:51:25,509
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, that stuff is so strong.

1993
02:51:25,589 --> 02:51:27,832
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the aroma that wafts up from the toilet.

1994
02:51:27,912 --> 02:51:29,935
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly, it's like, honey smacks.

1995
02:51:30,576 --> 02:51:32,118
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob's red, look, Rob's red.

1996
02:51:33,471 --> 02:51:35,913
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't believe this show has literally gone into the toilet.

1997
02:51:36,373 --> 02:51:48,099
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, we can't make poo-poo jokes anymore, so... Don't want you to compile a website of all the different foods that will make your bile and... Your one and two smell like something else.

1998
02:51:49,259 --> 02:51:52,541
[SPEAKER_04]: I can imagine some of our listeners are now going to go, Really?

1999
02:51:53,126 --> 02:51:54,868
[SPEAKER_04]: and, like, drink a whole gallon of blue wine.

2000
02:51:54,908 --> 02:51:58,150
[SPEAKER_03]: The blue wine punch, that shit is awesome, but they don't sell it anymore.

2001
02:51:58,491 --> 02:52:06,658
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't sell the blue stuff, they sell green and, like, orange and stuff, so, and red, and I don't, you know, want to drink a gallon of red.

2002
02:52:06,778 --> 02:52:09,180
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the blue stuff, and they don't sell it, and that sucks.

2003
02:52:10,021 --> 02:52:10,842
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, moving on.

2004
02:52:11,622 --> 02:52:14,745
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to everybody, because I have a Sega CDX and no one else.

2005
02:52:17,387 --> 02:52:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Sega CDX.

2006
02:52:18,188 --> 02:52:19,169
[SPEAKER_08]: Duh, duh, duh, duh, huh?

2007
02:52:20,359 --> 02:52:24,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Renee's saying an F you to everybody because he has a CDX and nobody else does, but you have one, don't you?

2008
02:52:25,481 --> 02:52:26,541
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.

2009
02:52:27,462 --> 02:52:29,302
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, I have a regular say, I have both.

2010
02:52:29,862 --> 02:52:30,943
[SPEAKER_08]: I have like all three, I think.

2011
02:52:31,543 --> 02:52:33,864
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you know what sort of context I mean in that last one.

2012
02:52:36,705 --> 02:52:42,787
[SPEAKER_04]: Zaku would like to say F you to being unemployed for nearly nine months and F you to not getting work study this year.

2013
02:52:43,550 --> 02:52:47,495
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to not having to wait this long to order my books for school.

2014
02:52:47,935 --> 02:52:54,602
[SPEAKER_04]: F you to State University of New York University Police for giving us heat for having lots of people in the front of our apartment on Friday and Saturday nights.

2015
02:52:58,827 --> 02:53:05,014
[SPEAKER_04]: Sin, or S1N, fuck you to there not being any retarded Target stores in Canada.

2016
02:53:07,758 --> 02:53:08,739
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there Target in Canada?

2017
02:53:08,999 --> 02:53:09,459
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope so.

2018
02:53:09,499 --> 02:53:10,440
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys are really missing out.

2019
02:53:10,760 --> 02:53:11,821
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, there is Target in Canada.

2020
02:53:12,021 --> 02:53:13,322
[SPEAKER_22]: And the Walmart doesn't have a star in the middle.

2021
02:53:13,342 --> 02:53:13,922
[SPEAKER_22]: It has a dash.

2022
02:53:14,843 --> 02:53:15,904
[SPEAKER_22]: Who fucking cares?

2023
02:53:16,124 --> 02:53:16,804
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.

2024
02:53:17,285 --> 02:53:20,487
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, if you watch shows that are supposedly in the U.S.

2025
02:53:21,047 --> 02:53:23,189
[SPEAKER_22]: and they're actually filmed in Canada, you can tell.

2026
02:53:24,590 --> 02:53:26,571
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got a lot of free time on your hands, don't you?

2027
02:53:27,092 --> 02:53:33,696
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a Walmart or Target commercial when it's showing what is out here known as Best Foods mayonnaise.

2028
02:53:33,896 --> 02:53:35,017
[SPEAKER_09]: It shows actually Hellman's.

2029
02:53:37,079 --> 02:53:43,024
[SPEAKER_04]: ColorOfSakura says, F you to silly high school drama that I keep getting pulled into because people think I care.

2030
02:53:44,165 --> 02:53:46,807
[SPEAKER_04]: Just remember... Yeah, it gets better in college.

2031
02:53:48,628 --> 02:53:49,950
[SPEAKER_22]: Because there's lots of drinking involved, too.

2032
02:53:49,970 --> 02:53:50,130
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.

2033
02:53:50,410 --> 02:53:52,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Ron Chan says, F you to the con I'm staffing for.

2034
02:53:52,532 --> 02:53:54,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm in charge of two departments, and I got no help here.

2035
02:53:55,034 --> 02:53:55,514
[SPEAKER_04]: I need a drink.

2037
02:54:01,779 --> 02:54:05,362
[SPEAKER_04]: Here I'm trying to pull out a machinima?

2038
02:54:05,723 --> 02:54:06,203
[SPEAKER_04]: Machinima?

2039
02:54:06,909 --> 02:54:10,870
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm finding I can't play the game normally anymore without feeling totally drained.

2040
02:54:10,990 --> 02:54:12,191
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh well, it was a good five-year run.

2041
02:54:13,391 --> 02:54:16,592
[SPEAKER_04]: I've owned that fucking game on like four different systems and I never want to play it again.

2042
02:54:16,812 --> 02:54:16,952
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2043
02:54:16,972 --> 02:54:18,732
[SPEAKER_09]: I haven't played it since I got married.

02:54:27,035 --> 02:54:28,135
[SPEAKER_09]: Neko means cat.

2049
02:54:28,215 --> 02:54:28,515
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.

2050
02:54:30,596 --> 02:54:30,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Blah.

[SPEAKER_04]: Leo, take him in from the inside.

2055
02:54:56,370 --> 02:54:57,230
[SPEAKER_04]: Take him out.

2056
02:54:57,290 --> 02:55:00,932
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to tell him about that live taping of This Week in Tech that's going on in NorCal.

2057
02:55:00,952 --> 02:55:05,634
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes, there's going to be... There's two podcasts I'll listen to, this one and This Week in Tech.

2058
02:55:06,075 --> 02:55:07,836
[SPEAKER_04]: Technically, this right now is not a podcast.

2059
02:55:07,936 --> 02:55:08,156
[SPEAKER_04]: I know.

2060
02:55:08,196 --> 02:55:08,876
[SPEAKER_04]: The podcast will be later.

2061
02:55:09,476 --> 02:55:11,317
[SPEAKER_22]: The one you guys... I know, I know what you mean.

2062
02:55:12,138 --> 02:55:14,399
[SPEAKER_22]: And This Week in Tech will be filming in Larkspur.

2063
02:55:14,599 --> 02:55:17,900
[SPEAKER_22]: Not necessarily filming, but recording before a live audience in Larkspur next week.

2064
02:55:18,481 --> 02:55:19,021
Where the hell's that?

2065
02:55:19,724 --> 02:55:21,906
[SPEAKER_22]: Dark Knight says own a final FU to accounting homework for causing me total brain damage.

2066
02:55:52,446 --> 02:55:54,367
[SPEAKER_04]: FU to Christopher for not bringing anything for us

2067
02:56:14,858 --> 02:56:18,721
[SPEAKER_23]: Sure, I saw Serenity, which was really, really, really well done.

2068
02:56:18,761 --> 02:56:20,362
[SPEAKER_23]: I recommend it to everybody.

2069
02:56:20,622 --> 02:56:23,184
[SPEAKER_23]: FYI, he's a little bit biased because he's a Buffy whore.

2070
02:56:23,464 --> 02:56:24,005
[SPEAKER_23]: That's okay.

2071
02:56:26,146 --> 02:56:28,208
[SPEAKER_23]: DarkSakura agrees with me, right?

2072
02:56:28,228 --> 02:56:30,469
[SPEAKER_08]: I wanted to go, and I couldn't.

2073
02:56:30,489 --> 02:56:31,210
[SPEAKER_08]: I have something for you.

2074
02:56:31,230 --> 02:56:31,930
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a bunch of nuts.

2075
02:56:35,113 --> 02:56:41,037
[SPEAKER_03]: I found out the other day, because this was last week after we watched, or we...

2076
02:56:42,170 --> 02:56:56,361
[SPEAKER_03]: And that reminded me of the trailer that was on one of them for the whole, I guess, because it's a gay porn version of The Ring.

2077
02:56:56,561 --> 02:56:57,081
[SPEAKER_03]: And guess what?

2078
02:56:57,161 --> 02:57:01,824
[SPEAKER_03]: Our company is actually distributing that, which is hilarious.

2079
02:57:01,844 --> 02:57:02,505
[SPEAKER_04]: I missed that.

2080
02:57:03,345 --> 02:57:03,665
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes!

2081
02:57:04,246 --> 02:57:04,446
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

2082
02:57:04,986 --> 02:57:10,850
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how a lot of pornos will, like, do funny, like, play on, you know, the regular movie title?

2083
02:57:10,890 --> 02:57:14,512
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I remember there was a porno once, um, it was Ally McFeel was a porno.

2084
02:57:15,553 --> 02:57:17,494
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, now, yeah, Word of Penis Hands I've seen.

2085
02:57:17,514 --> 02:57:20,677
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I saw, the first one I ever saw was The Bonehead.

2086
02:57:20,777 --> 02:57:23,278
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, Beaver and Buttface is another one I've seen.

2087
02:57:23,318 --> 02:57:25,180
[SPEAKER_04]: Before You're Gay, You See the Hole.

2088
02:57:25,840 --> 02:57:29,422
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, that, now they're doing The Ring, except it's the gay version.

2089
02:57:29,462 --> 02:57:30,123
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the hole.

2090
02:57:30,183 --> 02:57:31,264
[SPEAKER_23]: It's totally hot, too.

2091
02:57:31,504 --> 02:57:32,745
[SPEAKER_23]: I recommend that movie, too.

2092
02:57:34,033 --> 02:57:36,854
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, and I saw the Exorcism of Emily Rose, which was okay.

2093
02:57:36,874 --> 02:57:39,015
[SPEAKER_23]: It was okay?

2094
02:57:39,255 --> 02:57:39,435
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah.

2095
02:57:39,715 --> 02:57:40,875
[SPEAKER_23]: But Serenity was great.

2096
02:57:40,996 --> 02:57:41,616
[SPEAKER_23]: I recommend that.

2097
02:57:41,656 --> 02:57:43,096
[SPEAKER_23]: Two thumbs up.

2098
02:57:43,176 --> 02:57:46,517
[SPEAKER_23]: Two thumbs up and... You need to come up with a gay rating system.

2099
02:57:46,758 --> 02:57:47,878
[SPEAKER_23]: Two cocks up.

2100
02:57:50,139 --> 02:57:51,299
[SPEAKER_23]: I give it two hard dicks up.

2101
02:57:51,379 --> 02:57:51,619
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

2102
02:57:53,100 --> 02:57:53,620

[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

2107
02:58:02,847 --> 02:58:04,888
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, I didn't see it going in that direction.

2108
02:58:07,929 --> 02:58:09,629
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyways, we got a late FU.

2109
02:58:09,849 --> 02:58:11,170
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll like this one, Loki.

2110
02:58:11,490 --> 02:58:15,271
[SPEAKER_04]: Spirit Snare says, FU to Apple replacing the iPod Mini with the iPod Nano.

2111
02:58:18,412 --> 02:58:18,992
[SPEAKER_04]: Just thought I'd share.

2112
02:58:19,032 --> 02:58:20,073
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway, what do you got?

2113
02:58:20,093 --> 02:58:21,253
[SPEAKER_04]: We got a couple minutes left here.

2114
02:58:21,273 --> 02:58:21,733
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want to say?

2115
02:58:21,793 --> 02:58:22,614
[SPEAKER_03]: What do I want to say?

2116
02:58:22,934 --> 02:58:26,075
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to say that I was reading the other day...

2118
02:58:55,094 --> 02:58:57,035
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to know why they aren't sending me free samples.

2119
02:58:57,075 --> 02:58:57,975
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I want to know.

2120
02:58:58,475 --> 02:59:00,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Why aren't you sending me this shit for free?

2121
02:59:00,796 --> 02:59:01,977
[SPEAKER_03]: I should be having it already.

2122
02:59:03,277 --> 02:59:05,038
[SPEAKER_03]: Namco Battle Collection, my ass.

2123
02:59:05,698 --> 02:59:06,139
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

2124
02:59:06,959 --> 02:59:08,400
[SPEAKER_03]: I just can't wait for Burnout Revenge.

2125
02:59:08,420 --> 02:59:09,520
[SPEAKER_03]: It's coming out next week.

2126
02:59:10,921 --> 02:59:11,681
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that game.

2127
02:59:12,781 --> 02:59:15,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to get Burnout Legends to tie me over.

2128
02:59:15,743 --> 02:59:18,544
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a transitional into Burnout Revenge.

2129
02:59:19,584 --> 02:59:20,785
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be playing that for months.

2130
02:59:23,268 --> 02:59:25,669
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, until Liberty City Stories comes out.

2131
02:59:26,209 --> 02:59:26,369
[SPEAKER_04]: Huh?

02:59:28,310 --> 02:59:29,170
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, did we do the Cage Match?

2133
02:59:29,210 --> 02:59:30,230
[SPEAKER_04]: I love that we did Cage Match Winners!

2134
02:59:30,430 --> 02:59:32,691
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, fuckin' A. Who did win the Cage Match?

2135
02:59:32,711 --> 02:59:33,491
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the vote tally.

2136
02:59:33,932 --> 02:59:37,833
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's Cage Match winner was... It was actually very close.

2137
02:59:38,013 --> 02:59:41,154
[SPEAKER_04]: All three songs got a lot of votes tonight, so everybody should feel really good.

2138

[SPEAKER_04]: That was a very close one.

2145
02:59:56,023 --> 02:59:59,006
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I wanted to give a couple other plugs since we haven't been on the air in a couple weeks.

2152
03:00:14,319 --> 03:00:15,840

[SPEAKER_04]: That's the way to do it, my friend.

[SPEAKER_03]: I heard that the Apple iTunes, their store, their little ranking system's rigged, the whole thing.

2159
03:00:29,707 --> 03:00:36,689
[SPEAKER_03]: You basically can subscribe and unsubscribe rapidly, and it just counts how many times you click the button, and it'll move your... I heard they fixed that.

2160
03:00:37,529 --> 03:00:41,830
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't, because there was a little thing on Dig about it.

2161
03:00:42,610 --> 03:00:45,891
[SPEAKER_03]: It came up, and it's still broken, so that sucks.

2162

[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

2163
03:00:50,949 --> 03:00:51,430

[SPEAKER_04]: You should have a reality TV show.

2175
03:01:16,136 --> 03:01:16,716
[SPEAKER_04]: Hell no!

2176
03:01:18,086 --> 03:01:19,786

[SPEAKER_15]: What made her do it?

2211
03:05:00,328 --> 03:05:01,689
[SPEAKER_15]: Why'd she freak out?

2212
03:05:02,109 --> 03:05:04,271
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought the bullet had got her right in the ear.

2213
03:05:05,072 --> 03:05:08,355
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew then the end was near.

2214
03:05:09,916 --> 03:05:15,601
