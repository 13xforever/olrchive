36
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:46,380
You just made me think of Cinnabon. Oh, damn. I hunger for Cinnabon right now. I found really

37
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:52,220
good cinnamon bread. And I need an Ethernet cable, please. You know why Cinnabon pisses

42
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,420
We've got to talk about this game later on. That game was the shit.

43
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:28,800
Well, we'll talk about some various stuff tonight. Of course we've got a little bit of

44
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,820
Bimani news to talk about. Well, I don't know if it's so much a little bit, but the V-Rare is out.

45
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:39,820
We were going to play it for you guys tonight, except I couldn't get my hands on it, and I'm going to tell you about what happened there,

46
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:44,820
because it's kind of a funny story. We'll tell you about that. Loki's supposed to be getting a copy of it from inside Konami, but...

47
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:48,820
And also Ultramix 3's vrare, which we'll have first, hopefully.

48
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,320
Hopefully.

49
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,820
Hopefully.

50
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,820
The guy better hurry up.

51
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,820
Daniel's gotta hurry up, so.

52
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,820
Hopefully.

53
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:01,820
Well, we'll have those soon, so we'll play those for you guys, but a lot of you guys have been getting your grubby little hands on the vrare, so we'll talk about the vrare.

54
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:05,820
We're gonna talk about some other stuff, too, going on in Konami's world.

55
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,820
Really cute little Akira Yamaoka teaser I saw that I have to show you guys. It's so cute.

56
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:13,820
And who knows what else we'll talk about tonight.

57
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:18,820
We also have a special guest in the studio who just joined us. Say hello to Bugd!

58
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,820
I had to finish cracking out on Burnout Legends there.

59
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,820
That's fine.

60
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,820
Uh oh, bye Loki!

61
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,820
Is he going to pick up the game then?

62
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:26,820
Probably.

63
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,820
Alright.

64
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,820
We're going to go to a break.

65
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:35,820
I think we're going to start off this break with a song from a v-rare that will just...

66
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:41,820
I don't think any v-rare that ever comes out in the future will ever be able to compare to this v-rare because it was so damn good.

67
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,820
And that's Ultramix 2's V-Rare.

68
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,320
So we're going to play some songs from Ultramix 2's V-Rare.

69
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:49,320
Uh, started off with a little bit of, um,

70
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,820
Neuropa, because I like Neuropa, they're cool.

71
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,820
Gee, weren't we listening to Neuropa last night?

72
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,320
Yes we were, so we're going to hear them right now, with standing still in time.

73
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,320
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

74
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:03,320

Click on chat. See you there.

76
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:39,320
All my fading memories, back to where it all began

77
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:46,320
So much there I understand, as I look now

78
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:53,320
To a distance far away, I will cross a million lines

79
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:56,320
Now I'm standing still in time

80
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:02,820
Still inside, still inside

81
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:09,820
Still inside, still inside

82
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:14,820
Let me breathe

83
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:21,820
Let me open it to me

84
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:27,820
You fly, let me breathe

85
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:35,820
Let me know that I'm with you

86
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:43,820
Call me Nacha, I'm a cyber messenger, wack it in

87
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:47,820
Bit away, call me edge, I'm a kung fu monster

88
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,820
Beat away, you can't sweat, cause I'm evil first

89
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,820
In between, betray, who the what, must gotcha

90
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,820
Control your mess and I'll sway you man down

91
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:56,820
Deep in the sweat, there's a wire goin' on

92
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,820
Put your mask to the beat, call me Nacha

93
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,820
Don't you draw, keep your space, where the end

94
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:04,820
I'm a cyber messenger, wack it in

95
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:09,320
Yeah, then I drop to the next zone, you know, that I don't grow, come and grow, to the end, I

96
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,820
Yeah, then I drop to the next zone, you walkin' in, breakin' in, to the same time we nacha

97
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:18,820
Call me nacha, talk to draw, keep it speed with the end

98
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:22,320
Call me nacha, drop out of throw, come and grow

00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,320
Baby, better wait, call me edge, I'm a conquer monster, be the way you can sweat, tell the people first

100
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,320
In between, betray, who the what must capture, who the who want your mess around, pull away your makeup

101
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,320
The words are saying, baby, I found my soul

102
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,320
And it keeps me hanging on

103
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,320
Understand me now

104
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,320
The frequency of the beat gets higher

105
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon

106
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,320
No!

107
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,400
Just kidding. Orange Lounge Radio. Crap-free Bhavani Radio.

108
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:06,280
Hey kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

109
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:10,200
Episode number 155 here in progress. Yes, that's right.

110
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:13,720
We are actually live tonight. I'm so freaking excited.

111
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,000
We are off for a couple weeks there. One week was our choice. We were gone for a

112
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,960
week because, hey, you know what? We deserve a vacation once in a while.

113
00:14:20,960 --> 00:14:24,680
And actually, secretly, some things are going on behind the scenes including

114
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:29,260
Jamie's Bachelorette party happened to be the same night, but that was cool because I got to go

115
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:33,400
I was the only guy at Jamie's Bachelorette party, but it was fun. I had a good time

116
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:37,000
That's because you're special and I saw Xanadu for the first time

117
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:43,380
No, you need to sit down and watch Xanadu all the way through from beginning to end. That movie is awesome. Bring earplugs

118
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:48,320
No, I like the music in Xanadu. That actually was like one of the only things that made it worth it

119
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:57,320
The interesting thing about Xanadu, and I know a lot of you guys probably only know Xanadu from, you know, that song that was in DDR Third Mix.

120
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:01,320
Wait, I'm trying to play a clip here. There we go.

121
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:08,320
This is the first song a lot of people played in DDR.

122
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,320
It starts with an X. An X is always better.

123
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,320
Notice it's a one-footer. The Olivia Project. Queen of the one-footers.

124
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:20,320
Um, anyway. So Xanadu's like this old-ass movie. Well, not that old.

125
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:24,320
I mean, I was alive, but it can't be that old. 1980.

126
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,320
That movie is... 25 years old. Wow.

127
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,320
Had Gene Kelly in it. Yeah, so what it was trying to do was trying to be like a throwback

128
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:36,320
to, like, old cinema, where they would, you know, sing and dance

129
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,320
in the middle of it, and the plot was very thin, but that's okay, because

130
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,840
was all about the music that was kind of like the idea but the plot was about

131
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:49,360
wanting to open up a roller disco and Olivia Newton-John was the muse the plot

132
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:55,680
was about a guy who lost his inspiration and she was the muse I see see I'll show

133
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:58,580
you how much how much I was paying attention to the evidence because you

134
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:02,160
came in and did you see the animated part yes I did I love the animated part

135
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,440
it's Don Bluth Studios and Don Bluth owned to give it a video game connection

136
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:13,640
did Dragon's Lair, Space A. Same guy who did that stuff, and Dragon's Lair is awesome.

137
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,780
Even though Dragon's Lair was ridiculously simple and kind of, like, as a game itself

138
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:24,880
it was kind of stupid, like, the interactive cartoon feature of it made it so worth it.

139
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:29,080
The technology at the time was pretty nifty. It was kick-ass. Well, hell, I can sit here

140
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:33,740
and pay a quarter to control a laserdisc. That's really bad. Well, think about it.

141
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:41,180
We never got a perfect copy of Dragon's Lair at home until DVD players.

142
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:45,180
Or if you are into the emulation scene, the Daphne emulator.

143
00:16:45,180 --> 00:16:51,500
Okay, true, but I should say a blessed copy of it.

144
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
Novellma?

145
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,500
I'm not...

146
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,500
Oh.

147
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:55,500
Scooby?

148
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,500
No.

149
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,860
You say Scooby, I think Buffy, so...

150
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:00,860
No.

151
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:06,980
Anyway, so we were off two weeks ago because of that.

152
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:11,740
We had the Bachelorette party going on, which, by the way, was one of the more girly things

153
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:18,580
I'd seen in a while, and you know, being the gay guy, I got the inside look at what girls

154
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,140
really do when they get together.

155
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,900
We also had Barbarella, the parts of it anyway.

156
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:26,060
A little bit of it, which was, now that movie is stupid.

157
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:30,220
We missed the death by orgasm scene.

158
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,620
And Jessica made us skip the doll scene, which-

159
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,300
No, I made us skip the doll scene.

160
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,300
One of you two made us skip the doll scene.

161
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,220
I had nightmares about the doll scene.

162
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,660
The doll scene looked cool.

163
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,660
Anyway.

164
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:42,300
We'll watch it all the way through one day.

165
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:46,420
I keep mishearing that as dollzine from like Street Fighter, I'm like, where's the dollzine?

166
00:17:46,420 --> 00:17:47,420
Yoga!

167
00:17:47,420 --> 00:17:48,420
Yoga!

168
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:49,420
Yoga fire!

169
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:54,260
Death by yoga.

170
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,620
Yoga flame.

171
00:17:55,620 --> 00:18:00,620
Anyway, last week, we were all here. We had a shitload of people in the studio, too.

172
00:18:00,620 --> 00:18:06,620
We had, uh, Mikolatov was here, uh, Pixie Dust was here, the Orange Launch Madam, who hadn't been here in like a year and a half,

173
00:18:06,620 --> 00:18:16,620
and her, uh, fiancÃ© now, or long-time boyfriend, one of the two, no stylin' was here, and, uh, Mel B was here, and we couldn't do a show, because...

174
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:17,620
And we were drinking.

175
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,620
And we were drinking. We were quite intoxicated last week.

176
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,620
I had three Guinnesses.

177
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:28,140
And Live 365, due to some error after their maintenance window, they do regular maintenance

178
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:34,460
on Saturday nights now, but they did some stupid error afterwards that caused nobody

179
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,340
on Live 365 to be able to carry a live show, which pissed some people off royally because

180
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:43,940
there's some stations out there that run live all the time, which, you know, one day in

181
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:48,020
a more perfect world, I would like to be able to have Orange Lounge live all the time.

182
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,340
We'll see, you know, something we can look at for 2006.

183
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:57,540
But it kind of pissed some people off that they did that, so needless to say, a lot of

184
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:01,660
listeners complain, a lot of broadcasters complain, Live 365 will be very careful about

185
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:06,140
those sorts of things in the future, so we'll see.

186
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:09,500
Anyway, so now we're here this week after two weeks of no show.

187
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:12,140
Those of you guys that are members of our live journal community, you did get a show

188
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,980
last week, so that's all I can say about that.

189
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:20,860
I know we have some people listening for the first time tonight because of our podcast

190
00:19:20,860 --> 00:19:21,940
has still been going.

191
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:25,060
know, we did a podcast last week, even though we were slightly intoxicated, which I don't

192
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,380
think we really advertised on the podcast, that we were drunk when we were doing it,

193
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:34,900
or at least a little buzzed. At the beginning I think we mentioned it, but we didn't really

194
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:39,180
like, we weren't quite vocal about it as we usually are on the live show when we have

195
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:44,300
to react. Disclaimer, alcohol present. Something like that was basically the thing. But we

196
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:47,940
were quite intoxicated doing the show, but I have to hand it to us, and listening to

197
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:52,020
the playback of the show, we did a pretty good job considering how much we'd all had

198
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,020
to drink.

199
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:56,540
I was laying down in the chair with a beer in my hand.

200
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,020
You left halfway through, too.

201
00:19:58,020 --> 00:19:59,020
I had to.

202
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,020
You guys just let Mel B talk.

203
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
He sounded pretty damn sober.

204
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,020
Mel B was sober!

205
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:09,700
Okay, that would be why he didn't sound that drunk.

206
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:15,440
So we did the podcast, and we have new people listening tonight because we have the podcast.

207
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:19,220
And I know a lot of folks are saying that they're actually loading up their Live 365

208
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,440
stream in iTunes, especially now because you know iTunes 5 is out and all that stuff.

209
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,020
So iTunes is very cool.

210
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,060
Don't get me wrong, iTunes is a great program.

211
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:27,060
I use it myself.

212
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:30,920
However, I just want to warn you guys that Orange House Radio is presented in what's

213
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:40,440
called MP3 Pro, and iTunes does not support MP3 Pro, at least unless there's something

214
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:44,460
new in iTunes 5 I wasn't aware of, but as far as I know, they still don't support MP3

215
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,100
because it's an actual codec that you download as a plugin for Winamp, or I think there's

216
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:52,160
a couple other programs that support it, but of course Winamp, I mean if you're not using

217
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:57,680
iTunes you're probably using Winamp, or unless you got some other thing going on, which there's

218
00:20:57,680 --> 00:21:02,660
probably an MP3 codec for it. I think Media Player supports it now. Oh, Windows Media

219
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:06,700
Player? I think so. Maybe. Anyway, if you want more information on MP3 Pro, you can

220
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:12,280
visit our website, it's at orangehonestradio.com and check the FAQ. Now, I don't want to discourage

221
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:16,240
you guys from listening in iTunes because we will sound normal through iTunes except

222
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:22,320
we sound a little better with the MP3 Pro codec. It's broadband radio at a dial-up connection

223
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:25,720
because MP3 Pro does something to the header or something where it encodes...

224
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:31,080
It adds ten years of maturity. Basically, yeah. So, anyway. Although I did

225
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:35,320
download iTunes 5, it's kind of cool. The only thing I didn't understand about iTunes

226
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:39,960
5 is it really wasn't that much different from 4.9 except for they changed the store

227
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,880
And the look?

228
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:45,560
A little bit. But the look and feel, it's not like they change the colors or they

229
00:21:45,560 --> 00:21:46,720
change the

230
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:51,360
way the buttons look or anything. They just kind of change. Well, now it's more square instead of rounded.

231
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,680
But I mean, it's cool and all. So is the Mac now, you know. Don't get me wrong. I like iTunes

232
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:59,400
and iTunes 5 is cool and all, I guess. And it does the Outlook sync, I guess, which is cool if

233
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,560
you're into using Outlook, which I don't.

234
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,480
Outlook sync?

235
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:09,000
It syncs your contacts on your iPod with Microsoft Outlook.

236
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
If that's something that appeals to you, you could go do that.

237
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
I use Pine.

238
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,000
I use Pine.

239
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
For your email?

240
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Pine and Gmail, that's my two...

241
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,000
Yeah.

242
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
That's pretty hardcore.

243
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,000
Listeners in the chat room, blah blah blah, listening to some comments here.

244
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,000
Live365 needs to support AAC.

245
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
You're not the first person to suggest that,

246
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,000
and some folks have actually suggested that to Live365 directly.

247
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:44,000
I think that would be kind of cool because I think AAC has better encryption. You know what else has really good encryption is OGG.

248
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,000
And I'd like to see-

249
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Encryption or compression?

250
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Compression. What am I saying?

251
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,000
Okay.

252
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Someone just said OGG.

253
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Someone just said OGG. Oh, there it is. Yeah. OGG.

254
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:59,000
And there has been talk amongst, you know, are we going to stay with Li-365? Are we not going to stay with Li-365?

255
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:06,000
The problem- well, I guess I should say, Li-365 up until last week has actually been pretty damn good.

256
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,360
good, can't complain a whole lot. They've got nice people running it, too. Despite the

257
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:14,200
fact we've gone to their awards ceremony two years in a row and didn't win crap, we had

258
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:18,480
to pay. We had a pretty decent time. Betty's really nice, and she's like, you know, kind

259
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,040
of... I won crap. Oh yeah, that's right. We won the remote control a couple years ago.

260
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,680
And I won speakers by playing bingo. Did you actually get them? Yeah. Cool. I want to tell

261
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:33,680
you about Humongoid Box, you remember? That's right, you actually got to take the speakers

262
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:37,360
because you would come in from a long ways out of town, whereas the other folks had to

263
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:38,360
have it shipped to them.

264
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:42,540
And the speakers now hooked up to my PC, where they were probably on display at Gamestop

265
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:44,280
on Fulton and Marconi.

266
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,440
Right on, right on.

267
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:55,360
So anyway, Live 65 pays the licensing for songs that we play.

268
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:59,140
And although we've kind of had discussions on staff, whereas, you know, is the video

269
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:02,740
game music really, it's kind of in a gray area, you know, I don't think we really need

270
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:08,160
to pay licensing on it, we don't really know. We do play a lot of other music in our pre-show,

271
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:14,700
on Tuesday night's show, on the cage match that is ASCAP, BMI, all that stuff, licensed,

272
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:19,920
and so Life 365 pays our licensing fees for that. So we're all legit, we're legal. Believe

273
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:23,420
it or not, despite the hoards of things that Loki talks about on this program, our show

274
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:29,460
is 100% legal for you to listen to. If we leave Life 365, there is no other service

275
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:33,940
on the internet that I have found yet that offers a licensing payment service, like Life

276
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:39,300
365 does, for a decent fee. So that's kind of one reason we think we're kind of stuck.

277
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:44,100
But we've talked about, you know, going to Renegade and maybe doing another stream in

278
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,020
the future. It just depends how things play out with Life 365 the rest of this year. So

279
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,980
we will see. So we've been listening to you guys. We've thought about the switch up too,

280
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:59,260
but those are kind of the reasons why we hesitate a little bit. So anyway. And now there's a

281
00:24:59,260 --> 00:25:04,300
There's a whole lot of other suggestions there in the chat room, which is kind of cool.

282
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,100
Let's go back to mods.

283
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:07,100
What kind of mods?

284
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:08,100
Oh, like MOD format?

285
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:09,100
Yeah.

286
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:12,540
Dude, there used to be some kickass stuff in MOD format.

287
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,940
You can't stream that stuff, or...

288
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,260
No.

289
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:18,260
That's just like...

290
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,260
No.

291
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:21,260
It wouldn't work.

292
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:25,460
Besides, mods are like acid.

293
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,860
And no one likes acid.

294
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:27,860
Alright.

295
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,820
start tonight's show although we've been talking a little bit here with some

296
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,500
housekeeping things let's do a little bit of how was your week how was your

297
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,660
day and since we've been gone for a little while you can talk about the

298
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:39,940
highlights of your past few weeks if you should so choose starting off with the

299
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:46,520
one and only dark Sakura who is now a blushing bride congratulations that dot

300
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:56,300
dot yeah I got married it was pretty cool yeah nothing's really different but

301
00:25:56,300 --> 00:26:04,220
But uh, I was really getting married and playing with the puppies, and I played 2DX the other

302
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:05,220
day.

303
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,220
You were there.

304
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,220
I was there.

305
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,220
You played 2DX too.

306
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:09,220
I did.

307
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:10,220
I played 2DX, what were we playing, 7th and 8th style?

308
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,220
7th and 8th style.

309
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:12,220
On your ginormous fucking TV.

310
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,220
That you have in your living room.

311
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,980
It's so big it's pixelated stuff.

312
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:18,260
Yeah, it's so big that 2DX is pixelated on it.

313
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:23,020
And like we were looking at it going, gosh the quality of this is kind of junky.

314
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:27,240
But it's still 2DX in full arcade mode, widescreen on a 50-inch TV.

315
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,540
It was hot.

316
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,540
That was, like, cool.

317
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:30,540
And those red couches.

318
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:32,860
I enjoy playing 2DX on my 30-inch widescreen.

319
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,900
50-inch was very nice.

320
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,900
Yeah.

321
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,140
And, you know, I played, you know, it's more been a little bit of this and that.

322
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:45,060
I've just been really busy between getting married and going to school.

323
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:47,860
Haven't had too much time for much else.

324
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:51,060
And that, and I think I have sinus infection.

325
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:52,060
What shitty timing?

326
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,380
Oh yeah, seriously, especially since I'm, you know, busy all the time now.

327
00:26:56,380 --> 00:27:01,260
And it's going to get worse, because two more classes come up in October.

328
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:04,940
And I'm going to be back to doing homework all the time.

329
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:09,060
At least I can take my puppies to work.

330
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:14,060
I go out on break and feed my puppies during my break at work.

331
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:18,140
Addict. So, you know, so I don't want them to run away.

332
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:21,420
I'm saving up for the, trying to get the

333
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:26,760
well is it five million saved up so I can buy the house at the the Japanese

334
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:30,120
style house and make it is just five thousand five thousand five millions a

335
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:36,860
little hard to come by that game I will and then I'm halfway there very cool so

336
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:47,420
yeah that's it well well yeah there's a what I'm doing a yeah I don't know if

337
00:27:47,420 --> 00:27:54,020
people were listening, we got a pretty decent tune in for it, but on the first, I did the

338
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:58,380
premiere, not the first, what am I saying, the first, a few weeks ago I did the premiere

339
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:03,460
for the Blood and Scent album on Pump Up the Volume, and that had a pretty good reaction.

340
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:13,460
But I've been trying to do what I can to play some of that on my station, on my show.

341
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,460
Very cool.

342
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,460
Helping promote the indie labels.

343
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,460
Yep.

344
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:22,460
Because that's also part of what we do. We try to get the new and the neat out there.

345
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:27,460
But I really haven't had too much free time otherwise.

346
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,460
Working on it!

347
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,460
Alright, well I hope you get some free time pretty soon.

348
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,460
Oh, I also have been working on stuff for Shaft 2.

349
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:37,460
Ah, the tournament. Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

350
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:42,460
Tentative date around November 17th when DDRXBox releases.

351
00:28:42,460 --> 00:28:46,460
Or for some of us on staff, Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.

352
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:52,460
Yeah, there's that, but we're working on a GameStop sponsorship right now.

353
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:57,460
Very cool. And we might have sponsorship from the Big K too, right?

354
00:28:57,460 --> 00:29:04,460
So we'll see. So more details coming on that, so DER tournaments not dead yet because we're going to throw a hell of a party.

355
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:09,460
Why? Because we're the ones planning it here at Orange Lounge Radio with some help from our buddies in Sacramento.

356
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,460
And bowling.

357
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:13,460
Is that the big thing this year?

358
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,460
We're going to have a bowling tournament, too.

359
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:17,460
The first shaft was DDR and fried Twinkies.

360
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:19,460
This year will be DDR and bowling.

361
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,460
There was actually SCAT way back when,

362
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:25,460
which was Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

363
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:27,460
Which we had a 4% cosplay contest.

364
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,460
Yeah, 4 people dressed up.

365
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I liked Ryan's outfit.

366
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:33,460
He was the Afro Nova dude.

367
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:35,460
Yeah.

368
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:43,900
And we got up there and did Afronova in costume, that was pretty rad.

369
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,180
And then there was...

370
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:48,780
Somebody was Devil Zukin, I remember that.

371
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,780
Yeah.

372
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:50,780
We had...

373
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:53,240
That was actually one of our...

374
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,740
One of the old games...

375
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:59,420
Golf Land regulars.

376
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:04,340
And then we had the Twinkie one.

377
00:30:04,340 --> 00:30:07,800
We had the BeatMania contest with it too.

378
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:11,180
And this year it's going to be DDR and bowling.

379
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,340
Very cool.

380
00:30:12,340 --> 00:30:15,540
You know right now there's a whole lot of In the Groove tournaments going on because

381
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:19,780
they're doing like a national thing for In the Groove.

382
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:22,460
I have to be honest, I haven't read up on it because I don't think they're doing one

383
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,460
here in Sacramento.

384
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,260
I think they're going to do one at Miggle for kind of like NorCal.

385
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:31,100
From what I understand, there's actually been, it's officially by, what's the point called

386
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:32,100
now?

387
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
Paradise Island?

388
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:34,100
Paradise Island.

389
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:38,660
Did they have put a stop on any In the Groove tournaments until...?

390
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:42,220
That's what we heard, something about Sacramento locally, and I wish Explicit was here because

391
00:30:42,220 --> 00:30:46,300
he'd know more of the details on what's going on because he works there at Paradise Island.

392
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:50,180
Apparently what went on is that folks are using the old fishing wire trick where they

393
00:30:50,180 --> 00:30:54,180
put the fish... the... not that I'm telling you how to get free credits, don't do this

394
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:57,860
or we'll come find you and beat you up... where you put the token on the fishing wire,

395
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,980
you have like a hole in the token, you put the token on the fishing wire, and you can

396
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,580
kind of drop it in and then pull it out.

397
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
And then... no, no, no, no, no, no.

398
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,580
It's even more than that.

399
00:31:03,580 --> 00:31:05,580
You put it in there and beat on it.

400
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:07,580
And you get credit, credit, credit, credit, credit every time you beat on it.

401
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
Gotcha.

402
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
So yeah, don't do that at home, or at the arcade.

403
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:13,580
Yeah, because when you do that, then the arcades don't make money off you.

404
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
I do that at home.

405
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,580
You aren't in the groove.

406
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,580
Well, you can do that at home all you want.

407
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:20,580
We don't want to know about what you beat off at home.

408
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:21,580
Yeah.

409
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:23,580
My cabinet, duh.

410
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
Yeah.

411
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,580
I gotta play Miss World Nude.

412
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:28,580
Gotta, gotta, gotta.

413
00:31:28,580 --> 00:31:33,580
I have the luxury of being able to map the coin button to any of the buttons on the thing.

414
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:41,580
We've got our coin thing hooked up on ours so we just, like, hit the player one button continuously because it's on freeplay.

415
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:49,580
Anyway, so don't steal credits because then the arcade operators don't make money and then they decide to get rid of their DDR machines and then you wonder why DDR is dying.

416
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Oh, I did play something else.

417
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
What?

418
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:55,580
Arcade P.O.P.O. on the name.

419
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
There you go.

420
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
Yeah, I did play something else.

421
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:01,580
How was your week? How was your day?

422
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:34,580
to talk to other distributors and companies about their games, and he just didn't get a chance to send it yet.

423
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:39,580
But soon, he promised me he'll send it, so I have to wait for that.

424
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:48,580
And then the Tomo guy, they're the company that's behind the H-Tech products, so they're just going to send me some stuff, hopefully.

425
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:54,580
And we just, you know, EA, Microsoft, Ubisoft, just everybody.

426
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:58,200
all their lineup and everything it's fucking awesome and got to find out about

427
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:04,440
the Xbox 360 and all that fun stuff so anyways we did that I got lots of free

428
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:10,680
games which I then sold to GameStop to put towards my 360 so I now have $250

429
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:20,120
towards my 360 and then also what else oh well let's see yesterday relatives

430
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:28,600
came up and hung out with them and they barbecued for me and today I got lunch and I've been

431
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:35,280
just playing mainly a lot of Burnout 3 and then I got a, I found an ISO for Burnout Legends

432
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,600
so I've been playing that on my PSP because it's awesome. Just the kill time until I get

433
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,760
Burnout Revenge which is coming out next Wednesday and yeah, I can't wait for that. I already

434
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:50,440
I have it paid for, it's reserved, I just have to go pick it up.

435
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,080
Lots of fun stuff.

436
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,200
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

437
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Alright.

438
00:33:55,200 --> 00:34:00,560
Neil, would you care to share with us how your week and your day has been?

439
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,240
Well, remember we saw the Strangest Thing at Fry's yesterday, looking through the DS

440
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,240
games?

441
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,160
Yeah, what the hell, Fry's is carrying import DS games now?

442
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:10,160
Might just be the Bay Area.

443
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,280
But yeah, well, I think probably just that one.

444
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,280
Very interesting, but they're not carrying anything super special.

445
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:23,280
They had an import pool game, like billiards pool, and an import mahjong game.

446
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,280
That's it.

447
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,280
That's all we saw, at least.

448
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:27,280
At least that's all we found.

449
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:30,280
But no import copies in Nintendogs or games happening out here yet?

450
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:33,280
Yeah, because like the Game Boy Advance, there's no region coding on them.

451
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:40,280
Which is interesting that a major retailer such as Fry's, which I know is only on the west coast mostly, but...

452
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:42,280
They're sneaking out to the east.

453
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,840
Are they now? They're in Georgia, in Illinois, and Indiana now.

454
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:52,180
Well, Outpost.com, too, is the national site for fries, so they're carrying at least that

455
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,360
one store, some import DS games. Fremont, for those in the Bay Area.

456
00:34:56,360 --> 00:35:02,900
What have I been playing? I've been playing, well, guess what, Burnout 3! And, yes, I'm

457
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:09,880
also looking forward to Burnout 4. I guess I'm going to go sell back FlatOut and put

458
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:20,040
that down on it, because I did not like FlatOut. Compared to Burnout, it sucked.

459
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:23,760
Diablo II, and I've been playing drinking games.

460
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:26,440
Is Diablo II still really popular on the internet?

461
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:29,720
Apparently so. The servers are still pretty damn full.

462
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,320
Diablo II is like ten years old.

463
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,320
It came out in 2000.

464
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,120
2005 years old. That's still a long life for a computer game.

465
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:38,800
They just put out a patch for it last month.

466
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:42,560
Wow. It's up to 1.11. Are the people still playing it?

467
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:47,200
I played Diablo 2 for like a month and I just, I suck at it.

468
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,320
I just keep making more characters. I'm coming up, trying to come up with more creative names

469
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:52,560
like Itchy Scratchy,

470
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:56,000
Bernie, and other

471
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,080
nicely descriptive ones. Deadly,

472
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:03,020
stuff like that. And as for the drinking game, it's been going around all the

473
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,960
breweries and picking,

474
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,000
getting a full sampler and seeing which of their beers really suck,

475
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:12,680
And making sliding him back and forth until somebody says I'll fuck it and just drinks it best brewery. You've been to

476
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:18,980
Said work by far said works said work. No s just said work said work

477
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:24,120
Is that now is that just because it's the local one near you that's because it's the one I can stumble to yeah

478
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:29,220
All I have to do is be able to stumble back across train tracks, and I'm sad all right

479
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:35,080
But other than that Gordon Bierch down in down in the Bay Area and Pyramid Brewery, which is kind of a national

480
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:40,080
But this week I went to BJ's, which is kind of a pizza and a brewery place.

481
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,080
Isn't that like a chain of restaurants?

482
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,080
It's a chain.

483
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:43,080
It's a national chain.

484
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,080
They just built one.

485
00:36:45,080 --> 00:36:47,080
They've built two here in Northern California now, I think.

486
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,080
The one in San Jose does not have a brewery.

487
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:50,080
Okay.

488
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,080
There's one in Folsom.

489
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,080
Is there now?

490
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:53,080
Yeah.

491
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,080
They just built one up there.

492
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,080
Oh, it wasn't on their website.

493
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,080
And there's one in Roseville.

494
00:36:56,080 --> 00:36:57,080
Yeah, I went to the one in Roseville.

495
00:36:57,080 --> 00:36:58,080
Okay.

496
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,080
And then I went out to Lincoln to Beerman's and it was all bad.

497
00:37:01,080 --> 00:37:03,080
It didn't have enough taste to be real beer.

498
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,080
Gotcha.

499
00:37:04,080 --> 00:37:06,080
It's pretty bad. I'm turning into a beer connoisseur.

500
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:09,080
Now, last night was beer night.

501
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,080
Oh yeah, I did forget to mention that.

502
00:37:12,080 --> 00:37:17,080
Last night was our friend wedding reception at Dave & Buster's.

503
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:19,080
So I did actually play more games last night.

504
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:21,080
Where I went through 50 ounces of beer in 10 minutes.

505
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:25,080
I went through 50 ounces of beer in several segments.

506
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:28,080
I had Guinness in a blackened van.

507
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,080
And so I bought that blackened van.

508
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,080
And played BattleTech.

509
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:38,960
You know what I found? The 8-player Daytona USA? They don't have drink holders, you can't

510
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:39,960
drink and drive.

511
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Damn it.

512
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:44,320
It sucks. Most of the other driving games do have cup holders, so you can put down your

513
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,320
giant beer and drive.

514
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:50,360
You want to know what's sad about that Daytona set-up, though? I played the first one when

515
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:57,240
it was completely brand new, debuted in Vegas when I was in 11th grade, which was in 90-

516
00:37:57,240 --> 00:37:58,240
A while ago.

517
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Two. Wow. I know. No, you couldn't have been in 11th grade in 92.

518
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,240
I graduated in 94. Holy crap. You're older than us.

519
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:15,240
Well, I'm 29. I graduated junior high in 92, but I guess that makes sense, because I would have started in 9th grade in 92.

520
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:21,240
Hey, amazingly enough, I did too. Just for those who don't know, I've known Bugs since, like, 7th grade.

521
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:24,240
I almost said 4th grade, I don't know why. 7th grade.

522
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,480
into somebody at Dave & Buster's last night that I met in fifth grade, and he recognized

523
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,480
me.

524
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,640
Yeah, how do you recognize somebody from the fifth grade?

525
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,200
Because I shaved.

526
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:40,920
I usually am fully inflamed in beard, and happened to shave yesterday.

527
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:41,920
I don't look that different.

528
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:45,480
We went through the yearbooks at the birthday party last month, and I don't look that different.

529
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,920
At least I never looked like a dork.

530
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,760
I have a friend of mine who I just talked to last night.

531
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,600
Well, finish your guys' story, then I'll do my side note.

532
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,560
We were looking at your picture and laughing.

533
00:38:55,560 --> 00:38:57,060
Shut up.

534
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,060
We need to scan that.

535
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:02,820
I'm sorry for interjecting again, but the other game I played was, uh, Midnight, uh,

536
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,960
was a Lincoln Midnight, um, Maximum Tune.

537
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,080
And I kicked Han's ass.

538
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:08,080
It was great.

539
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,400
Isn't he a really big Initial D fan, too?

540
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,400
Yeah.

541
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,400
That's quite an accomplishment.

542
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:20,620
He picked an EVO-8 with the MR, with the sixth speed transmission, and I did the MR in automatic

543
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:23,400
just because I hate having to deal with it, and I still won.

544
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,400
Okay, I'm done.

545
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,400
Sorry.

546
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:31,320
Uh, I had 6,667 coupons on my card last night at one point.

547
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Jeez.

548
00:39:32,320 --> 00:39:35,200
I only got 1,900.

549
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
I've bought very few things from the little Dave & Buster's redemption store.

550
00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:40,040
And I still haven't gone through those pixie sticks.

551
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:43,860
For those of you guys who have never been to Dave & Buster's before, it's like Chuck-E-Cheese

552
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:47,160
or like an arcade with pizza type thing.

553
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:49,680
Chuck-E-Cheese and arcade, pizza, and a bar.

554
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:51,260
Yeah, but for adults.

555
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:53,080
And they kick kids out at some point, right?

556
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,280
Like after 10 o'clock, don't they get...

557
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,200
At any time, they have to be accompanied by an adult.

558
00:39:58,200 --> 00:39:59,920
And they usually aren't, which...

559
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:03,080
Although oftentimes they are, that's why you're not tripping over kids all the time.

560
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,920
Yeah, which is nice, because you don't have little kids running around screaming so much,

561
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:09,400
and little kids in there thinking they own the place and stuff, because their parents

562
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:10,400
have to be with them.

563
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,140
Well, just think little kids plus big drunken people don't really mix well, because big

564
00:40:14,140 --> 00:40:15,680
drunken people can punt little kids.

565
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:21,160
But it's so nice that you can be there and game with other adults.

566
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:24,260
And although it's kind of cheesy because half their games are ticket games, just like a

567
00:40:24,260 --> 00:40:26,380
normal arcade, but they're so much fun.

568
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:29,240
Like they have, they had a pachinko type one, but they got rid of that.

569
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,080
And they got rid of the other one because it broke to the point they couldn't fix it.

570
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:34,280
Yeah, the, the golden temple one.

571
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,640
The one where you push all the money off, however.

572
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,760
Did they have the flaming finger still?

573
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:39,760
Yes, flaming finger still.

574
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,880
I want flaming finger jackpot, first try.

575
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:47,220
Flaming finger is this game that you control with your finger on like this giant touch

576
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,220
board.

577
00:40:48,220 --> 00:40:49,220
The countdown speeds up the further you get up there.

578
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,220
Yeah, it does, it does.

579
00:40:50,220 --> 00:40:53,900
You have to move your finger through the maze as fast as you can to win the jackpot.

580
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:54,900
Made by Namco.

581
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,900
Yeah, made by Namco.

582
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:58,840
And as a- like, uh, we were- Mikolatov was there yesterday and I was kinda hanging out

583
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,100
with him most of the day, and, um, he- he would say, no, don't play it, just let's listen

584
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:04,100
to the music.

585
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:06,100
Cause he likes the music.

586
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:10,020
Cause it does a pooch, like a little techno music when you're moving your finger through

587
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:11,020
it.

588
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:13,780
Also, Mikolatov made me play tons of Pump It Up yesterday.

589
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,140
That's like every time I was looking for Rob, it was like either by the bar or by Pump It

590
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:19,140
Up.

591
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
It doesn't make it any better.

592
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,140
No, it's cool.

593
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:23,140
I'm actually starting to like Pump It Up.

594
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:26,140
Damn him for making me like Pump It Up.

595
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:30,140
But between the home release, which I'll talk about after the break, the home release and

596
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:35,140
this recent arcade release, as much as I still hate Pump's interface, I'm really starting

597
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,140
to like Pump a lot more, which is kind of scary.

598
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,140
Are you really Rob?

599
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:40,140
I know.

600
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:41,140
I don't know what happened.

601
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:43,140
I think it's a pod, Rob.

602
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Rob did show me earlier, though, and I'm not sure.

603
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:51,940
Rob did show me earlier, though, another reason why In the Groove sucks, and I thank him for

604
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:52,940
that.

605
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:58,700
All right, we were playing, Loki brought over some games tonight, or should I say, he just

606
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,400
brought over his PS2 hard drive, which is loaded with games.

607
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,460
And I'm looking at his list of games.

608
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:06,460
And you know how when you load a game onto the HD loader, for those of you guys who have

609
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:09,020
seen it, you can write in whatever the game is called.

610
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:15,080
Well, he wrote in, In the Groove, parentheses, this game sucks, because you know kids that

611
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,220
Loki does not like In The Groove and he makes no apologies about hating this game.

612
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:22,300
So I said, well I want to look at this, I want to see how the home version turned out.

613
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:26,900
Granted, I got to go to their premiere party in San Francisco months ago thanks to DR Freak,

614
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:31,600
but you couldn't hear the songs there and it was still, I don't think it was a finished

615
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,600
version.

616
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:35,600
So I wanted to see how it really looked like on my TV, on my setup.

617
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,520
So we checked out In The Groove and I said, Loki, did you hear about that they had censored

618
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:42,240
all these songs in In The Groove?

619
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,260
And Loki said, what?

620
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:49,820
So we played Torn, and that's the one that goes, you know, I'm cold and I am shamed,

621
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:51,380
lying naked on the floor.

622
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:57,220
That's how the lyrics go, but they did, I'm cold and I am shamed, lying on the floor.

623
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,980
What is bad about the word naked?

624
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,920
They censored the word naked, no, but this is the one that got me, is that there's one

625
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:10,100
in, we were playing Mouth, and I swear to God, the lyrics go, when I kiss your salty

626
00:43:10,100 --> 00:43:16,660
The game went, when I kiss your lips, and I was like, what the hell is wrong with the

627
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:17,740
word salty?

628
00:43:17,740 --> 00:43:21,620
Although I could be wrong, like maybe the word was sexy lips or something and I'm just

629
00:43:21,620 --> 00:43:24,580
wrong in what I remember of hearing, but I'm like, what the hell is wrong with the word

630
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:25,580
salty?

631
00:43:25,580 --> 00:43:29,700
This is why censorship is bad.

632
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:34,620
In the Groove is on a low sodium diet apparently, so I am now calling the In the Groove PS2

633
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:35,620
version.

634
00:43:35,620 --> 00:43:40,900
the In the Groove Mormon edition.

635
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,540
You remember when Titanic first came out on VHS, these Mormon families were taking their

636
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:50,260
tapes in to be edited so that they could cut out Kate Winslet's boobies out of the movie

637
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:55,820
and the scene where the hand gets slammed because they're having sex and all that.

638
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:59,260
They actually would physically cut up the tape and it was a really bad editing job so

639
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:02,780
they could show this movie to their kids because Titanic was a historically important movie

640
00:44:02,780 --> 00:44:03,780
or whatever.

641
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:10,780
But they cut out the boobies. That's just, that's exactly what they're doing in this game. They're cutting out the salt.

642
00:44:10,780 --> 00:44:13,780
And I can imagine the lowkey that would be just the boobies.

643
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:25,780
The first time I saw that movie was off of a pirated copy from the Oscars that they gave the Oscars panel to watch, which is how I had it on VHS about six months early.

644
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:34,780
The first time I saw that movie was on HBO, and it was such a bad movie, we couldn't get up to turn it off because we had no will to live anymore.

645
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:38,780
And so we decided that we were like, somebody get up and stop it, please.

646
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:40,780
The ending's pretty cool, with the boat.

647
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:48,780
Yeah, the only reason I like this movie is because Leonardo DiCaprio died, and he died a horrible death.

648
00:44:48,780 --> 00:44:51,680
You know what, you can see his thumb break off.

649
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:55,320
When she's letting go and he's falling into the water, his thumb is still attached to

650
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,280
the piece of driftwood.

651
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,280
Well that's cool.

652
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:01,320
That was really cool.

653
00:45:01,320 --> 00:45:05,680
I still, as I said, I haven't seen it, and I already know how the movie's going to end,

654
00:45:05,680 --> 00:45:06,680
why would I want to see it?

655
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:07,680
The boat fucking sinks!

656
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,400
How can you make a three hour movie about something you already know of?

657
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,000
Well, then there's like JFK, Nixon, uh...

658
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:22,480
Decaprio dies, the boat sinks, the old lady had the jewel the whole time. There, I just

659
00:45:22,480 --> 00:45:26,800
saved you three hours of pain. You know, you can thank me via email.

660
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:32,320
The ending of The Passion of the Christ totally came at me as a surprise. I did not expect

661
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:33,320
that.

662
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,960
You know, I really liked the book a lot better.

663
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:41,640
Well, wasn't Passion of the Christ for the breakout in Song and Dance at the end, or

664
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,360
am I thinking of a Mel Brooks movie again?

665
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:44,360
I think you are.

666
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:48,180
by the way i have a dilemma

667
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,360
jesus christ

668
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,600
november

669
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:54,000
yes depeche mode concert or bill ingvall

670
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:55,140
depeche mode

671
00:45:55,140 --> 00:45:56,040
all the way

672
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:57,140
all the way

673
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:01,080
i'm still debating cuz i don't like concerts bill ingvall is

674
00:46:01,080 --> 00:46:03,080
not that funny to me

675
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:07,360
then again where am i from? Alabama so they actually watch blue-collar

676
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,480
comedy tour whatever down there i guess but

677
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,440
not in my house

678
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:15,740
Bill Engvall is funny funny. Have you listened to any of his stuff all the way through?

679
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,540
I actually had to watch one of the episodes of that show once.

680
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,040
Okay.

681
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,440
They all do a little stand-up in it.

682
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:25,240
I'm gonna bring over my friend, Julie's DVD, and you're gonna watch it with me.

683
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:27,740
That's even better.

684
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:30,440
It's Steven Lynch is releasing a new album.

685
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:31,740
Isn't he dead?

686
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:34,040
No, that's Mitch Hedberg that's dead.

687
00:46:34,040 --> 00:46:34,540
What?

688
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,340
How do I get those two confused?

689
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:39,240
No, Steven Lynch is much alive.

690
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:43,240
Mitch Hedberg was the one that was doing crack or whatever.

691
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:46,240
I just assume all the funny comics are dead, honestly.

692
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
Comics aren't funny until they die.

693
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,240
Why couldn't he live to release another CD?

694
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:54,240
I mean, honestly, I loved his work and he had to go and die after the second CD.

695
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:59,240
That is such a cop-out. That's like something Gravity Kills would do.

696
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,240
Or Echo Image.

697
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,240
Or come back, we're under a new label, we're really working on that album that'll never ever come out.

698
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:40,720
weeks worth of email, but you know, I'll live. And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI while

699
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:46,320
I was here. Loki, everybody got their Promivians done yesterday.

700
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:50,720
Son of a bitch! The mic's not on.

701
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,480
Fucking asshole! Son of a bitch! Okay, listen. Why the hell does everybody... Okay, how much

702
00:47:55,480 --> 00:47:58,760
you want of it? Does everyone have their AF done? Because they sure as hell won't help

703
00:47:58,760 --> 00:48:01,480
me with mine. No, I don't. I'm only level 53. I don't have

704
00:48:01,480 --> 00:48:08,000
I only have like, I have the boots which are completely useless for a black mage and I

705
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,840
don't have any of my permivians done.

706
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,760
I don't even know why I have the chains of permothia or whatever it is, because I can't,

707
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,860
I don't go to any of those places.

708
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:19,400
We're all experts at those permivians now.

709
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,040
We can run you through them like this.

710
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,840
I need, I've been trying to get back in and play, it's just I have too many things I've

711
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,120
tried to do at the same time.

712
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,760
It's for the best, honestly, because I probably won't be playing much Final Fantasy 11 after

713
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,920
this week. I won't have time. Oh, I don't have time, but I'm buying World of Warcraft.

714
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:42,480
Well, at least one of us needs to be reporting on that game, so, fine. Because World of Warcraft

715
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:46,560
is a really big and popular game, and none of us are playing it, so. Well, at least they

716
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:50,880
actually have some really cool system or game that's within the game, you know, sort of

717
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:59,640
like a capture the flag type thing, but we have ballista. Woo, ballista! That was crap.

718
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:04,180
splits ball that's true I will take the blitz but I'll take the ballista minigame

719
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:09,620
over that fucking card game in eight yeah thank God Tetra master isn't in the

720
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:12,940
game oh no Tetra master was nine it was a different card game in eight it was

721
00:49:12,940 --> 00:49:15,620
pretty much the same thing though wasn't it I never touched the card game the

722
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,700
card game can suck my balls I hated the card I never played it it's but you feel

723
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:24,720
like you have to or you're gonna miss out on items um I didn't feel like I had

724
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:27,840
to I didn't care about this you know that I just how I played again I got

725
00:49:27,840 --> 00:49:32,840
I went halfway through the third disc before I was like, screw it, I'll let somebody else beat the game and I never touch it again.

726
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:43,840
You know what game I also got done playing a lot of? I was playing a lot of.hack because I actually went and picked up that game because I played it once, like a year and a half ago.

727
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,840
And I was always like, I want to get that game, I want to get that game. So I finally got it because it's like 20 bucks somewhere.

728
00:49:47,840 --> 00:49:48,840
By the way, Jamie.

729
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:49,840
It's neat, I like it.

730
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:54,840
They leaked Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Japanese DVD copy onto the internet.

731
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:58,960
was just about to get into that. I know. I was just about to get into that. Haven't downloaded

732
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:04,040
it though. First off, it's today is September 11th, so you know what that means. It's Loki's

733
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:11,200
birthday today. Happy birthday, Loki. Yay. So how old are you now? 25. 25. Oh, a quarter

734
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:14,960
century old. Now how did you celebrate your birthday today? I went to Olive Garden and

735
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:20,520
had lunch, and that was it. Yummy. Well, since I was too cheap to get you a present today,

736
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,440
I decided to leak Final Fantasy VII Advent Children on the internet for you.

737
00:50:24,440 --> 00:50:26,440
So enjoy, because I know you really wanted that.

738
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:27,440
So check it out.

739
00:50:27,440 --> 00:50:29,640
Yeah, there's been a lot of people doing the same type of thing for me.

740
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:33,200
Like, for example, somebody leaked Burnout Legends on the internet, so I got to play

741
00:50:33,200 --> 00:50:36,960
that and, you know, Advent Children on the internet, and what else was there that they

742
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:38,760
leaked on the internet that I downloaded?

743
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,320
Uh, that's some other stuff, I'm sure.

744
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:43,480
Burnout Legends was me.

745
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:45,040
Oh, well, thank you.

746
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,280
I appreciate it.

747
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:53,380
And yeah, I know there was one other thing that they did.

748
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:58,480
You know a DS game that everybody has been just going off about and just loving and adoring?

749
00:50:58,480 --> 00:51:02,340
I need to pick this up because everybody is just wanting to make sweet love to this game

750
00:51:02,340 --> 00:51:04,720
and they're doing it in the chatroom right now.

751
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,720
Advance Wars DS.

752
00:51:05,720 --> 00:51:11,160
I've heard lots of great things about this game, but I need to pick it up at some point.

753
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:12,160
They have a site.

754
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,120
You can make paper Advance Wars characters.

755
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,520
That's cheesy, but cute.

756
00:51:16,520 --> 00:51:20,040
Nintendo it's a very Nintendo thing to do well Nintendo didn't do it some guy

757
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:24,360
did no that's even worse or whatever where can they download this wasn't it

758
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:29,960
on dig calm yeah dig a link to it dig dig.com yeah how's the link to the

759
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:33,860
it's like slash dot but they you know they pat themselves on the back way too

760
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:42,920
much no and the stuff is sort of relevant and they're usually the dupes

761
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:49,920
groups get, you know, put together. You don't have to wait days for them.

762
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:53,000
Let's all profess our love for Slashdot.

763
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:58,560
I like Slashdot. It's a good sign. Anyway, uh, there's low energy in here tonight.

764
00:51:58,560 --> 00:51:59,440
I don't know what it is.

765
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,600
No, we need diverse systems. More diverse systems.

766
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,760
We will do a diverse systems break later than you, I promise you. But I had to do this,

767
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,360
this break. First I had a request for No Doubt Get Loud because of the new iTunes commercial,

768
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:14,620
So they said I should play that song, but we'll get to that song in this break

769
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:19,300
However, there's a song that's more important that I have to get to in this break and it's for Jamie, of course

770
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:25,120
And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Launch Radio and and your calls coming up pretty soon in the show

771
00:52:25,120 --> 00:52:26,240
so go to

772
00:52:26,240 --> 00:52:30,000
Orange launch radio comm and click on interact with us and you can give us a call say hello and

773
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:36,480
Bahmani news because we've been talking about all sorts of other video games, but I want to talk about pump it up and other

774
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,480
Bamani, actual Bamani titles. So we'll be back after this. Jamie, this one's for you.

775
00:54:06,480 --> 00:54:29,560

Coming to Manaita's with that white speaker.

Picking up my ass beat Sepa in the backyard.

My friend coming to my neighborhood with a last price

795
00:55:56,540 --> 00:56:01,120
By a peacock, she's peeking at my ass, being changty in the backyard

So little joy, so little joy, it's complicated So little time, so little time, you're acclimated

799
00:56:48,760 --> 00:56:55,760
So little hope, so little hope, and I'm paying off for love, yeah

800
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:58,160
I should've made a thousand days of change

801
00:56:58,160 --> 00:56:59,660
But not so many

802
00:56:59,660 --> 00:57:01,660
A thousand years and thousand days

803
00:57:01,660 --> 00:57:03,160
So give me your lady

804
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:05,160
A stone in the middle of the dark

805
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,160
I'm raised up for love

806
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,160
Love

807
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:10,160
Praying for love

808
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,160
Love, love, love

809
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:14,160
Simply be love

810
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:16,160
Love, love

811
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,160
Simply be love, love, love

812
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:23,160
Simply be love, love, love

813
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:25,460
Simply being in love

814
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:28,580
It's more than enough

815
00:57:30,460 --> 00:57:32,460
Simply being in love

816
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:35,880
Simply being in love

817
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:43,160
Simply being in love

818
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,220
Simply being in love

819
00:57:50,220 --> 00:57:57,220
It's more than enough, simply be loved

820
00:57:57,220 --> 00:58:04,220
It's more than enough, simply be loved

821
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:09,220
It's more than enough, yeah

822
00:58:09,220 --> 00:58:19,220
What are you trying to rid you of anything?

823
00:58:19,220 --> 00:58:22,220
You're just a ghost and it seems

824
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:25,220
Just as you're leaving we're hiding

825
00:58:25,220 --> 00:58:26,220
Are you a boss?

826
00:58:26,220 --> 00:58:27,220
Are you somebody?

827
00:58:27,220 --> 00:58:30,220
Are you leaving anything?

828
00:58:30,220 --> 00:58:32,220
Are you a family?

829
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:33,220
Don't know

830
00:58:33,220 --> 00:58:36,220
I'm just a man who's gonna leave this place

831
00:58:36,220 --> 00:58:43,220
One day I'll be alive

832
00:58:49,220 --> 00:58:52,220
You don't have to believe in a heart of a tale

833
00:58:52,220 --> 00:58:54,220
But it's all solid by your feet

834
00:58:54,220 --> 00:58:57,220
Still wanted to lose on you at first

835
00:58:57,220 --> 00:59:00,220
But it's getting older

836
00:59:30,220 --> 00:59:32,220
Don't you say anything

837
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:34,220
Look in the mirror

838
00:59:34,220 --> 00:59:36,220
Hiding away the past

839
00:59:36,220 --> 00:59:38,220
You are my love

840
00:59:38,220 --> 00:59:40,220
I believe in anything

841
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:42,220
You say I'm free

842
00:59:42,220 --> 00:59:43,220
Come on

843
00:59:43,220 --> 00:59:44,220
Come with me

844
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:46,220
Don't leave me there

845
00:59:46,220 --> 00:59:48,220
Come on

846
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,220
Come on

847
00:59:50,220 --> 00:59:52,220
Come on

848
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:54,220
Come on

849
00:59:54,220 --> 01:00:17,220
We're going to do an extra song this break, this one's a special dedication.

850
01:00:17,220 --> 01:00:29,220
The End

851
01:00:29,220 --> 01:00:35,220
The End

852
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:40,880
The

853
01:00:40,880 --> 01:00:48,880
It would be a much better sight with you with me

854
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:55,880
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

855
01:00:55,880 --> 01:01:00,880
Never felt so lonely then you came along

856
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:07,880
So now what should I do? I'm strung out, addicted to you

857
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:15,880
My body ached, now that you've gone My supply fell through

858
01:01:15,880 --> 01:01:20,880
And they gave me everything you had and more

859
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:26,880
You craved my happiness When you made me feel a toy and made you smile

860
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:34,880
But now I feel your stress Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

861
01:01:34,880 --> 01:01:36,880
And who has time but you?

862
01:01:36,880 --> 01:01:42,880
Never thought I'd sit around and ramble your love

863
01:01:42,880 --> 01:02:09,120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and joining us tonight.

864
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,360
I notice we have a lot more listeners than we usually do tonight.

865
01:02:11,360 --> 01:02:13,680
don't know what the heck's going on if we just are getting more people because

866
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,720
of our podcast or if because I actually talked about it in the live journal

867
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:19,640
community or people are just going through withdrawals because we weren't

868
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:22,920
here for two weeks or just a combination of all the above which I'm thinking is

869
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:27,500
partly that but regardless thanks for tuning in and wasting your Sunday night

870
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:33,500
with us we appreciate it and we're just here talking about what's on our mind

871
01:02:33,500 --> 01:02:38,480
pop culture things DDR baumannii related things as they come up and what have you

872
01:02:38,480 --> 01:02:47,040
I want to talk about Nintendo. Nintendo pisses me off. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total

873
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:52,220
Nintendo fanboy, but ever since I bought a widescreen TV, I've come to loathe Nintendo

874
01:02:52,220 --> 01:02:56,840
for their lack of support for widescreen and HD formats. You may have heard that story

875
01:02:56,840 --> 01:03:00,680
a while back where Nintendo said that they're not going to be supporting HDTV with their

876
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:07,480
revolution. Well, that's, I don't know why they're doing that in my opinion. Especially

877
01:03:07,480 --> 01:03:11,820
as HDTVs become more and more the standard. I realize right now not a lot of people have

878
01:03:11,820 --> 01:03:17,960
HDTVs, but if you go shopping for a new TV, they're starting to get priced pretty competitively.

879
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:23,480
You know, the TV I picked up was $600, which granted is quite a bit of money, but not that

880
01:03:23,480 --> 01:03:28,040
much more money than what you'd pay for a normal TV of the same size, probably about

881
01:03:28,040 --> 01:03:33,000
$200 more. So I think as the technology, you know, gets older and older and we start getting

882
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,200
into Christmas, I think HDTVs are really going to start taking over. And Nintendo has this

883
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:41,040
absolute lack of support for

884
01:03:41,040 --> 01:03:46,800
HDTVs and widescreen. And I kind of realized that as I was trying to find a

885
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:49,920
component cable for my Nintendo GameCube because as you know

886
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:54,360
Loki got me a copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue a while back

887
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:58,080
and Dark Sakura actually bought me Super Smash Brothers Melee for my

888
01:03:58,080 --> 01:03:58,800
birthday

889
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,760
except due to various reasons I just got it this week but that's alright.

890
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:09,200
So I wanted to check that out and play it and I didn't really have cables, I only have

891
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,920
the standard cables but no components to be found anywhere.

892
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:17,520
So I'm looking on Nintendo's website, get this, they discontinued production of the

893
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:21,600
component cables like years ago.

894
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,600
Well maybe not that long ago, like a year ago or two years ago.

895
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:28,280
They discontinued production of the component cables and get this, your GameCube has to

896
01:04:28,280 --> 01:04:33,680
have a special port on the back that says digital in and out for you to even be able

897
01:04:33,680 --> 01:04:40,400
to use this component cable if you could find one. The new Gamecubes they made after mid-2004

898
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:46,220
don't have this. They took a feature away from the new Gamecubes. They took this digital

899
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:51,900
out port away. And their reason why? They said less than 1% of our users were using

900
01:04:51,900 --> 01:04:57,800
it. And I'm thinking, well okay, because the Gamecube is kind of the kiddie system, right?

901
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:03,240
The Gamecube is the thing that the kid has in their bedroom so that they can play Pokemon

902
01:05:03,240 --> 01:05:09,120
or whatever, right? But the GameCube can also function as a pretty decent gaming system

903
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:15,320
for the rest of us hardcore gamers, right? Like, for instance, Resident Evil 4, F-Zero,

904
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:19,880
Smash Brothers Melee, although it's kind of, you know, kitty-like in its artwork, it's

905
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:25,440
a great freaking game. It's one of my favorite games they put out on GameCube. No support

906
01:05:25,440 --> 01:05:32,480
for HD because they say less than 1% are using the HD feature as it is. I don't understand.

907
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:35,280
And how much was it just to put that little extra port on the back?

908
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:38,700
I guess maybe this is one of the cost, maybe this is a way that they made the GameCube

909
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:44,220
cost only $80 was by taking this future out, but that's cheap.

910
01:05:44,220 --> 01:05:49,440
You know that that cable that they do use, the S video and the regular video, that cable

911
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:54,400
they do use is the same cable they've been using ever since the Super Nintendo.

912
01:05:54,400 --> 01:05:55,920
No, the Famicom had it.

913
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,240
Did the Famicom have it too?

914
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:58,420
Yeah, the Japanese.

915
01:05:58,420 --> 01:06:00,420
The regular...

916
01:06:00,420 --> 01:06:02,420
Bugs trying to say something about the Famicom had it, too.

917
01:06:02,420 --> 01:06:04,420
Yeah, the Japanese Famicom has it, too.

918
01:06:04,420 --> 01:06:08,420
Oh, I didn't realize that. See, now the Nintendo America just had red and yellow wires.

919
01:06:08,420 --> 01:06:12,420
Right, because that's all we had at the time. We didn't have any sort of connectors to really do it with.

920
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:14,420
So that cable...

921
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:19,420
Well, I guess that's kind of nice that you can take your Super Nintendo cable and use it on your Nintendo 64 and your GameCube.

922
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:23,420
It hasn't changed in the last 15 years.

923
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:27,420
So, I don't know. I'm a little disappointed at Nintendo's lack of support.

924
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,920
And some of the games on GameCube actually support widescreen TVs. I played F-Zero on widescreen.

925
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:41,420
It was sexy as hell, but blurry. Blurry because S-video is as high as it goes. Sadness.

926
01:06:41,420 --> 01:06:47,420
And, you know, it sucks too. It's really limiting themselves because they were only, you know, wanting to put out, you know,

927
01:06:47,420 --> 01:06:52,420
family games because this whole, you know, they didn't really want to touch on the whole, you know,

928
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,220
curated games and stuff back when Mortal Kombat was out there. It's like, oh, we're just gonna

929
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:00,060
pad out normal games, you know, and make this more kid-friendly system, because that's what

930
01:07:00,060 --> 01:07:05,740
people were looking for. And now they've kind of missed the bus. And now, you know, this

931
01:07:05,740 --> 01:07:10,820
whole, well, there's not gonna be, you know, that many broadband TVs and stuff. No one

932
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:14,900
owns them right now. Well, yeah, but people are gonna be buying them, you know, in the

933
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,780
future. So what are you gonna do with your game system then?

934
01:07:16,780 --> 01:07:20,580
I just, I'm having a hard time believing that they're, they're, they're, it seems like they're

935
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:25,700
trying to put out a system that will support what the market wants right now, but no system

936
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:31,260
ever really takes off at launch, except for maybe, I don't know, Super Nintendo maybe

937
01:07:31,260 --> 01:07:37,260
did, but PlayStation even took a while to get big. Final Fantasy VII, I'm going to just

938
01:07:37,260 --> 01:07:40,900
say this, it might piss some people off, I think Final Fantasy VII is when the PlayStation

939
01:07:40,900 --> 01:07:45,120
really started picking up. When Square announced that they were going to jump ship and go over

940
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:48,340
and start making games for PlayStation, that's when the PlayStation really started selling

941
01:07:48,340 --> 01:07:52,340
we saw a lot more games for it. That, in addition to things like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot.

942
01:07:52,340 --> 01:07:56,340
But I think that was really, like, the turning point.

943
01:07:56,340 --> 01:08:00,340
Even PlayStation 2, their launch titles weren't

944
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:04,340
humongous. Fantavision?

945
01:08:04,340 --> 01:08:08,340
So no system ever really takes off in Fantavision. And Xbox launch?

946
01:08:08,340 --> 01:08:12,340
Don't make me laugh. And I think one of the only reasons

947
01:08:12,340 --> 01:08:16,340
PlayStation 2 had such a huge launch, which was probably one of the bigger ones in recent memory,

948
01:08:16,340 --> 01:08:18,980
which still wasn't, it's not like they were...

949
01:08:18,980 --> 01:08:22,140
I think it was riding on the success of the PlayStation.

950
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:25,900
Well that, that, the fact that it would play the old PlayStation games, and that it was a DVD player.

951
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:28,060
People were buying PlayStation 2s as DVD players.

952
01:08:28,060 --> 01:08:29,860
That was actually really true in Japan.

953
01:08:29,860 --> 01:08:34,940
But one thing about, though, the DVD player on the PS2 is that it's a piece of crap,

954
01:08:34,940 --> 01:08:38,140
and using it as your primary DVD player will shorten the life of the system.

955
01:08:38,140 --> 01:08:40,060
I don't believe that one bit. That is true.

956
01:08:40,060 --> 01:08:43,060
I used mine as my primary DVD player, never had a problem.

957
01:08:43,060 --> 01:08:45,340
You are in the minority then.

958
01:08:45,340 --> 01:08:48,840
I've heard of the problems, but I've yet to see it.

959
01:08:48,840 --> 01:08:55,340
Dan has told me that just about every return within the first few years of the PS2's release

960
01:08:55,340 --> 01:09:00,840
were for, basically, they were sliding off the track, it was everything related.

961
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:05,840
Everyone who brought theirs back was because they were using it as a primary DVD player.

962
01:09:05,840 --> 01:09:09,340
I've used both my PlayStation 2 and my Xbox as DVD players.

963
01:09:09,340 --> 01:09:12,340
I'll tell you right now, the Xbox is a better DVD player, hands down.

964
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,840
Oh yeah, because it's a more intelligently built system.

965
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:17,320
Better be if you got to pay $20 extra to use it.

966
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:18,320
Yeah, that too.

967
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,320
The fact, oh, that, oh.

968
01:09:19,320 --> 01:09:20,320
Microsoft could blow me for that.

969
01:09:20,320 --> 01:09:26,320
The Xbox itself, though, is a more intelligently constructed piece of equipment.

970
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:27,320
In a way, in a way.

971
01:09:27,320 --> 01:09:37,080
It's made of better parts, it's a more stable system, you know, I bet if you drop a PS2

972
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:41,200
and an Xbox, less of the Xbox will break.

973
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:42,200
Maybe.

974
01:09:42,200 --> 01:09:44,560
I love, because it's so damn heavy.

975
01:09:44,560 --> 01:10:00,560
Microsoft is awesome because they're like, oh yeah, well this time around you don't have to pay extra to get your wonderful DVD remote. You can watch DVDs right out of the box. And everyone's like, oh yeah, but you've got to buy your hard drive.

976
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:02,560
It's not connected to me in IRC.

977
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,560
There's just too many people in IRC, it's me.

978
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,560
It's not connected to Rojo.

979
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:14,560
No route to host.

980
01:10:14,560 --> 01:10:30,000
Alright. Alright. Moving on. What was I going to talk about here? A little follow-up to

981
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:34,420
something we were talking about earlier in the program. Talking about those In the Groove

982
01:10:34,420 --> 01:10:39,120
tournaments that are going on around the nation. I said that Milpitas is going to be having

983
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:43,840
one I think. Well, go figure. The person who's actually helping to put on this tournament

984
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:49,040
actually listening tonight and gave me a link to more information on the In The

985
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,560
Groove tournament that's going to go on at Milpitas Golf Land. So for those of you

986
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,240
guys that happen to be in Northern California, September 24th 2005 is the

987
01:10:56,240 --> 01:11:00,840
date of the tournament, 11 a.m. for registration. Ten bucks will get you in

988
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,040
the tournaments. Ten dollars flat, there's no pre-reg fees, nothing. This is a

989
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:09,800
straight-up perfect attack, expert only. You can find more complete rules over on

990
01:11:09,800 --> 01:11:14,520
DDR Freak and their tournament forums. But since it's in the Groove Expert tournament

991
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:18,120
and I'm too old and too fat, yeah, I will not be entering this tournament. But I might

992
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:25,600
go just have fun. Just to see people. But we'll see. So check that out. Loki, I will

993
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:36,440
not be attending this tournament. You wouldn't go just to socialize with people? No. Just

994
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:43,160
curious the only thing I would want a boxer for in the first place is to have

995
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:49,040
a good system to run step mania on that's really all I wanted for food makes

996
01:11:49,040 --> 01:11:53,040
food makes the arcade game much better use of the boxer than in the group

997
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:58,960
anyway anyway you can find more information on a in the group tournament

998
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:03,720
happening near you on in the groove calm tell they're doing this big national

999
01:12:03,720 --> 01:12:10,720
Tell them, Red Octane, or not even Red Octane, Roxer. Get ahold of those guys in Japan, they're making good music.

1000
01:12:10,720 --> 01:12:14,720
I'm telling you, you could put them together. Some good stuff there.

1001
01:12:14,720 --> 01:12:19,720
I mean, at least it'll make the game a little bit better. But, you know, whatever.

1002
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:26,720
To each his own, if you want to play it, it's fine. I don't care.

1003
01:12:26,720 --> 01:12:35,720
I can't believe there's people out there that played the Mad Cats one, so I mean, it's gotta be the MC Grooves dance craze.

1004
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:42,720
I know, it's horrible. You know what Mad Cats helped put out recently, though, that's actually pretty damn good? Pump It Up.

1005
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:49,720
Pump It Up Exceed, home version, kicks ass. I was very surprised, but it kicks a lot of ass.

1006
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:55,720
Despite the fact that I still hate the interface, I can't stand the way you go around and you pick your songs, it's better than it used to be.

1007
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:02,920
to be. It's about as good as that Pump It Up system is going to get, the home version.

1008
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:06,860
And there's a whole assload of songs in this game. They kind of split up the songs into

1009
01:13:06,860 --> 01:13:11,840
three channels. You have your Banya channel, and Banya is kind of like the Naoki of Pump

1010
01:13:11,840 --> 01:13:15,120
It Up. You know, it does a lot of these, just a variety of different types of songs.

1011
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:19,200
So is it like 97 songs in the Banya channel and 4 in the other one?

1012
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:22,800
I know it's actually pretty evenly spaced out. I'll give it to them for that. It's about

1013
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:27,800
30 songs a piece. You've got the K-pop station, which is pretty rad. They've got a lot of

1014
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:34,800
songs under K-pop, including some songs you might recognize from DDR, such as Staryan.

1015
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:44,800
What's the other one? Caution is the other one. There's a Korean version of Venus. I

1016
01:13:44,800 --> 01:13:50,240
don't think Face is in the home version. I think it was in the arcade somewhere, but

1017
01:13:50,240 --> 01:13:55,160
It also has a Korean version of Venus, which is kind of cool.

1018
01:13:55,160 --> 01:14:00,880
And then there's a pop channel, which mixes some songs that have been in arcade versions

1019
01:14:00,880 --> 01:14:04,160
of Pump It Up previously, like Booby Law.

1020
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,600
I can't remember the name of the song, I just know it's the Booby song because it's the

1021
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:09,160
video that has just the chick with the boobs.

1022
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:13,180
So Come Make It Round and Kiss Me as in Exceed 2.

1023
01:14:13,180 --> 01:14:18,200
So there's a couple songs in the arcade, and then some interesting American exclusives.

1024
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:22,740
Crystal Method is in there, and Elvis has a song in there.

1025
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:27,000
That one Australian band with the crazy video.

1026
01:14:27,000 --> 01:14:29,560
I can't remember the name of the song.

1027
01:14:29,560 --> 01:14:31,960
The song is like, forget it, forget it.

1028
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:37,680
So I was a little bit apprehensive to play Pump It Up

1029
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,760
the first time, because I was kind of like,

1030
01:14:39,760 --> 01:14:41,280
I don't like Pump It Up in the arcade.

1031
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,640
But I've just played old versions of Pump It Up,

1032
01:14:43,640 --> 01:14:46,600
I guess, because this interface is better than the old ones.

1033
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,600
It's not as slow.

1034
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:52,920
it's a lot faster moving. And there's just a shitload of songs, which is pretty neat.

1035
01:14:52,920 --> 01:14:55,760
Pump It Up takes some getting used to, though. You can't just go from DDR to Pump It Up,

1036
01:14:55,760 --> 01:15:01,000
because even though it seems like, oh, well, they just tilted it 45 degrees and put a center

1037
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:05,360
button, yeah, but you have to read the arrows a whole different way. It's just a different

1038
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,800
way of reading them with the colors and everything. So it's a little bit of a challenge at first.

1039
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:15,160
And there are some crazy-ass step patterns that shame in the groove step patterns, even,

1040
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:21,020
reasons of difficulty, if that's what you're into. But I think that kind of stuff is retarded,

1041
01:15:21,020 --> 01:15:25,860
so I don't play that. So I didn't really, just, you know, my friend made me look at

1042
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:29,960
a few of the really, really tough step charts and I just kind of went stupid and went back

1043
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:35,220
to playing the more fun steps. So I actually really enjoy Pumping Up Exceed. I recommend

1044
01:15:35,220 --> 01:15:38,780
it. If you guys are into the dance games, pick this up. This will hold you over until

1045
01:15:38,780 --> 01:15:42,560
the DDR releases. Now granted, the downside is that you have to get a whole new pad with

1046
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:47,600
this so the bundles gonna cost you about 60 bucks but the soft pad that comes

1047
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:53,200
with it is actually pretty darn nice it's it's a better quality than those

1048
01:15:53,200 --> 01:16:03,880
konami soft pads they put out so pretty nice I enjoyed it what else is going on

1049
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:08,000
in the momani world right now besides me playing pump it up dance dance

1050
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:12,080
revolution strike yes right dance dance revolution strike was announced dance

1051
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:18,080
Dance Dance Revolution Strike is going to be, assumably now, Japan's version of EX2.

1052
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,080
Basically, EX2.

1053
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,000
It tells the story of a union dancer that decided that he's not going to take it anymore

1054
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:27,200
and decided to strike.

1055
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,880
It's a very strange name, isn't it, for the game.

1056
01:16:30,880 --> 01:16:31,880
But whatever.

1057
01:16:31,880 --> 01:16:38,080
Dance Dance Revolution Strike, the eye being an exclamation point, will be shown at the

1058
01:16:38,080 --> 01:16:40,640
Tokyo Game Show 2005, so they say.

1059
01:16:40,640 --> 01:16:41,640
A couple days.

1060
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:46,240
it a couple days away. It's supposed to have that same interface as Extreme 2 and

1061
01:16:46,240 --> 01:16:51,560
Dancing Stage Max, of course, overseas in Europe. The website for the game also had

1062
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:56,040
a special little page set up talking about the new Naoki song called Passion

1063
01:16:56,040 --> 01:17:01,320
of Love. I almost thought it was Passion in Love. Passion of Love, Naoki featuring

1064
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,320
Politary. So you might remember the rumors a while back that Politary was in

1065
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:07,520
studio recording something for Naoki. This is what it is, and it's going to be

1066
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:14,620
featured in Dance Dance Revolution Strike. No word yet as to, no word yet as to whether

1067
01:17:14,620 --> 01:17:20,940
it's going to be inside EX2 or the European version of Dance of the Sage Max as of yet.

1068
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:27,280
So we'll see. Sure it will be. Well yeah, I'm pretty sure it will be too, but nothing's,

1069
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:31,380
nothing said one way or the other yet. We don't know when this game will actually be

1070
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:46,180
coming out, but end of year, early next? 2006. 2006? Spring. 2006 it is, then. All right.

1071
01:17:46,180 --> 01:17:50,460
We're going to go to a break. When we come back from this break, did your download finish?

1072
01:17:50,460 --> 01:17:58,780
Almost? Try me back at about 8.30. Trying a little while? 8.30. All right. Ish. We'll

1073
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:07,220
do that. Stupid slow FTP. In this break, Loki wanted me to play something from the disc

1074
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:14,140
he brought last week. Yes! Finally! Finally! We picked up the new Diverse System albums,

1075
01:18:14,140 --> 01:18:22,340
D7, all three CDs of that, D8, and also Dear Mr. Taka, plus some other special stuff like

1076
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:29,480
Like the Chorus K album and the good cool Ultra Expander CD, which has the most kickass

1077
01:18:29,480 --> 01:18:36,660
remix to absolute, which you might have heard if you downloaded our non-show last week.

1078
01:18:36,660 --> 01:18:39,380
And lots of good stuff.

1079
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:44,580
My personal favorite for D7, and I was waiting ever since I heard the little teaser for it,

1080
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:48,140
was the Trip Machine Dark Core mix.

1081
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:49,700
Awesome.

1082
01:18:49,700 --> 01:18:54,040
There's a remix of Ecstasy on there, which is really cool.

1083
01:18:54,040 --> 01:18:55,200
And a few other things.

1084
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:59,640
There's a remix of Love Love Shine, which is interesting.

1085
01:18:59,640 --> 01:19:02,040
Okay, so what am I going to play here?

1086
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:03,040
Okay!

1087
01:19:03,040 --> 01:19:04,760
I think we should play the Trip Machine Dark Core Mix.

1088
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,760
Where's that?

1089
01:19:05,760 --> 01:19:06,760
That's a D7.

1090
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:08,760
Oh, you have the wrong CD.

1091
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:10,760
Oh, dammit.

1092
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:13,960
Uh oh.

1093
01:19:13,960 --> 01:19:14,960
This is the one, isn't it?

1094
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:16,560
The Dear Mr. Talk and all that stuff?

1095
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:17,960
Nah, but this is my other one.

1096
01:19:17,960 --> 01:19:18,960
There's a second CD.

1097
01:19:18,960 --> 01:19:20,960
What's that on your thing over there?

1098
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:21,960
Is this it?

1099
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:22,960
No.

1100
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:23,960
No, it's blank.

1101
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:24,960
Oh, crap.

1102
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:25,960
Oh!

1103
01:19:25,960 --> 01:19:28,400
I have it around somewhere.

1104
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:29,400
I'll keep looking for it.

1105
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:30,400
Is there something on that CD?

1106
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:31,400
Yeah, well, fine.

1107
01:19:31,400 --> 01:19:33,400
Let's see what's on here.

1108
01:19:33,400 --> 01:19:39,840
Um, okay, actually, it might have been in a case for you.

1109
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:42,640
I think I put it in a case.

1110
01:19:42,640 --> 01:19:43,640
Or something.

1111
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,640
No.

1112
01:19:44,640 --> 01:19:46,640
No, that's not it.

1113
01:19:46,640 --> 01:19:54,080
Um, so anyways, we've got some stuff on here. Um, the verse system stuff, um, we have Dear

1129
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:25,960
Just a verse system. Alright, here we go.

1130
01:25:53,960 --> 01:25:55,960
Oh

1131
01:26:23,960 --> 01:26:25,960
Oh

1132
01:28:23,960 --> 01:28:25,960
Oh

1133
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:53,200
So that was some music from the new Diverse Systems 7 album.

1134
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:57,200
as new as Diverse Systems 8 though which is also out. Yeah. So look for those. And Diverse

1135
01:29:57,200 --> 01:30:03,520
9 which is coming. Coming very soon. Yeah. Alrighty. Very cool. And some people said

1136
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,760
they couldn't hear the trip machine. Yes. Our chat room was kind of going that's trip

1137
01:30:07,760 --> 01:30:12,120
machine. I heard trip machine. I don't see how you couldn't. I've heard it. Yeah. The

1138
01:30:12,120 --> 01:30:17,440
synth lines are the same. The synth lines are the same but where's my mommy can you

1139
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:21,320
sing trip machine? Where was that? Where was that? The trip machine is like drum and bass

1140
01:30:21,320 --> 01:30:25,660
and this is like Dark Horse, so it's a little different. I liked it. I thought it was cool,

1141
01:30:25,660 --> 01:30:29,980
but... It was okay. It was okay. I think this is the only way to possibly light trip machines.

1142
01:30:29,980 --> 01:30:34,700
There is an interesting... The double versions are horrible. There's a blues version of,

1143
01:30:34,700 --> 01:30:45,460
or like, kind of like a jazzy blues type version of, I want to say, oh god, not Make Your Move,

1144
01:30:45,460 --> 01:30:47,600
but like um... one of the older ones

1145
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:50,020
now put your faith in me uh...

1146
01:30:50,020 --> 01:30:51,820
keep on moving

1147
01:30:51,820 --> 01:30:54,540
that's on one of them too, we'll have to play that later, it's kind of funny

1148
01:30:54,540 --> 01:31:00,220
but then they also have the long version of uh...

1149
01:31:00,220 --> 01:31:03,860
made in innocent which was in uh... food mix 2

1150
01:31:03,860 --> 01:31:04,980
or food mix

1151
01:31:04,980 --> 01:31:07,720
plus i want to say

1152
01:31:07,720 --> 01:31:12,420
yeah, food mix plus

1153
01:31:12,420 --> 01:31:14,260
What we're going to do now, boys and girls, is we're going

1154
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:17,020
to head on over to the wide, wonderful world of Skype,

1155
01:31:17,020 --> 01:31:19,980
which is the way that you can talk to us by giving us a

1156
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,500
call, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1157
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:25,620
Click on Interact With Us for all the details you need on

1158
01:31:25,620 --> 01:31:29,020
how you can call us via the Skype line.

1159
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:31,660
If you are already a Skype user, then you probably know

1160
01:31:31,660 --> 01:31:32,540
how to use this program.

1161
01:31:32,540 --> 01:31:36,020
All you've got to do is call username OrangeLoungeRadio.

1162
01:31:36,020 --> 01:31:37,700
Who would have thought that our name would be

1163
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:39,940
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word there on Skype?

1164
01:31:39,940 --> 01:31:40,460
So weird.

1165
01:31:40,460 --> 01:31:41,780
I know, we got really creative.

1166
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:47,780
We'll always sit there and wait for somebody to call us, because there's not a whole lot of people logged into Skype, so I don't know if we'll even get anything here.

1167
01:31:47,780 --> 01:31:51,780
I do want to make sure this gets a mention here. This was something that happened while we were gone.

1168
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:57,780
Guitar Freaks and Drummania V2, on their way out.

1169
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:09,780
They do have a website opened up. We link to it from our website over at orangelandtrader.com, but it's konami.jp slash am slash location test, because this is something that's currently location testing.

1170
01:32:09,780 --> 01:32:34,780
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, V2. And of course, the reason why Guitar Freaks and Drummania is now V is because they did a little bit of a hardware upgrade on the stuff there when they upgraded, or when they put out V. They did a little bit of a hardware upgrade, so now they have the full videos and everything, and the game's just a little bit prettier. So that's something to be looking forward to. Let's take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1171
01:32:34,780 --> 01:32:37,780
Hey Sky, Siggy here. Hello Siggy, how are you?

You were practically next door. What was going on in San Francisco?

1176
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:53,780
No, I just made, you know, my final visit to the city because my father just moved back here in Vegas.

Oh, I got you. Okay, so you had family living in San Francisco.

1250
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:59,740
Oh god, at first I thought you said her Volvo, and I'm like, oh, she's driving along in her Volvo.

1251
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:01,740
That's kind of weird that she's driving a Swedish car.

It's spelled B-U-L-B-U-L.

So, some stuff to look forward to there.

1258
01:38:11,740 --> 01:38:15,740
Any idea when this is going to be official as out of the location test?

1259
01:38:15,740 --> 01:38:21,740
Well, the location test for Guitar Fix Romania V2, I'm not certain.

1260
01:38:21,740 --> 01:38:28,740
They were doing the location test right now, as of now.

1261
01:38:28,740 --> 01:38:35,740
So, usually what? The location test goes on for about a month, and then they go back for a month or two, and then the game comes out usually, right?

1262
01:38:35,740 --> 01:38:42,500
Oh, I forgot to mention, about Tokyo Game Show, I checked on their website, and they

1263
01:38:42,500 --> 01:38:46,600
just recently announced popinmusic throughout Edelhofer on Playstation 2.

1264
01:38:46,600 --> 01:38:49,660
Big surprise, not.

1265
01:38:49,660 --> 01:38:53,800
I mean, honestly, popinmusic's been constantly coming out for the Playstation 2, so that's

1266
01:38:53,800 --> 01:38:57,420
no surprise at all, but that's good for the popinmusic fans, of course.

1267
01:38:57,420 --> 01:38:58,420
Good news.

1268
01:38:58,420 --> 01:38:59,420
All right.

1269
01:38:59,420 --> 01:39:00,420
Sounds cool.

1270
01:39:00,420 --> 01:39:03,100
Well, now, Tokyo Game Show's happening this week, right?

1271
01:39:03,100 --> 01:39:04,100
Or is it next week?

1272
01:39:04,100 --> 01:39:05,100
This Thursday.

1273
01:39:05,100 --> 01:39:14,100
Awesome. So you gotta go, since I can't read the Japanese, you gotta go on some of those sites and look at the news and come back and let us know.

1274
01:39:14,100 --> 01:39:15,100
No one else is good.

1275
01:39:15,100 --> 01:39:16,100
What?

1276
01:39:16,100 --> 01:39:20,100
Revolution news, they're gonna show the controller and everything in Mario 128.

1277
01:39:20,100 --> 01:39:22,100
So we're gonna get a lot of news this week from Tokyo Game Show.

1278
01:39:22,100 --> 01:39:23,100
Oh yeah, that'd be exciting.

1279
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:25,100
Alright. Alright.

1280
01:39:25,100 --> 01:39:28,100
Yeah, and one more thing.

1281
01:39:28,100 --> 01:39:32,100
Uh, it's not KeKak, it's KeChak.

1282
01:39:32,100 --> 01:39:33,100
KeChak.

1283
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:34,100
I like KeKak.

1284
01:39:34,100 --> 01:39:38,100
No, you have to go to Indonesia. Believe me, it's Kecak.

1285
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:43,100
I don't doubt that the pronunciation I'm doing is horribly wrong, but, you know, I like Kecak.

1286
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:49,100
Alright, Kecak. I said it once correctly, just for you. Alright.

1287
01:39:49,100 --> 01:39:57,100
Yeah, and, you know, just after I go off, just announce to them about a tent-style CS.

1288
01:39:57,100 --> 01:39:59,100
Uh-huh.

1289
01:39:59,100 --> 01:40:02,100
Yeah, I really, you know, I really pre-ordered mine.

1290
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:05,100
When's the street date for that? Isn't that October?

1291
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:06,100
November 17th.

1292
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:07,100
November 17th.

1293
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:08,100
Yeah.

1294
01:40:08,100 --> 01:40:11,100
So don't you remember last year in November was like a huge month for Bomani?

1295
01:40:11,100 --> 01:40:16,100
Because we got like UltraMix 2, 8 style, and Pop'n Music like 10 I think it was?

1296
01:40:16,100 --> 01:40:17,100
All in like the same day.

1297
01:40:17,100 --> 01:40:27,100
And remember, as I mentioned on the non-show, that the new DDRs and the new Carrique Revolutions are gonna have demos for each different version.

1298
01:40:27,100 --> 01:40:28,100
That's out there now.

1299
01:40:28,100 --> 01:40:36,100
One of the news sites published that in their review, so that's out there now where everybody knows that you can play demos, one and the other.

1300
01:40:36,100 --> 01:40:41,100
And I still envy those people at Rhode Island right now, because they have Happy Sky!

1301
01:40:41,100 --> 01:40:50,100
I heard! You know, I was talking to Miklotov over the weekend, and he said that he damn near got on a plane to go out there to play it, and I was like, you're crazy!

1302
01:40:50,100 --> 01:40:55,100
Well, if you've got your simulators out there, I have all the key-sounded BMS files for Happy Sky.

1303
01:40:55,100 --> 01:40:58,100
I guess if you want a cheap knockoff, there's a way to do it.

1304
01:40:58,100 --> 01:41:00,100
Or if you like the remix stuff.

1305
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:03,100
Well, that's true too. Remix with the key sounds is good.

1306
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:04,100
That's cool.

1307
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:07,100
Well, are you going to be taking a trip out to Rhode Island anytime soon then?

1308
01:41:07,100 --> 01:41:10,100
No thanks. I'd rather not.

1309
01:41:10,100 --> 01:41:11,100
That's what I figured.

1310
01:41:11,100 --> 01:41:12,100
In Rhode Island?

1311
01:41:12,100 --> 01:41:14,100
Well, there's Happy Sky.

1312
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:16,100
Lobster.

1313
01:41:16,100 --> 01:41:19,100
All right. Anything else you wanted to share with us tonight, Ziggy?

1314
01:41:19,100 --> 01:41:23,100
Not much else. I'll just let you know what news are going to come out.

1315
01:41:23,100 --> 01:41:24,100
Sounds good.

1316
01:41:24,100 --> 01:41:26,100
Tokyo Game Show

1317
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:58,100
My timer didn't show up there for a minute there.

1318
01:41:58,100 --> 01:42:01,100
DarkSakura is not a fella.

1319
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:04,100
Hey honey, what's up?

1320
01:42:04,100 --> 01:42:06,100
How you doing? What's on your mind?

1321
01:42:06,100 --> 01:42:09,100
Not much. I got some information here.

1322
01:42:09,100 --> 01:42:12,100
First things first, I don't know if you guys noticed, but

1323
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:17,100
it seems that Katamari Damacy 2 or We Love Katamari came out early.

1324
01:42:17,100 --> 01:42:18,100
It came out early?

1325
01:42:18,100 --> 01:42:20,100
Nope.

1326
01:42:20,100 --> 01:42:23,100
Okay, the guy who works for the game distributor says no.

1327
01:42:23,100 --> 01:42:29,100
Well, um, I have a link here to somebody who went to Target and bought it today.

1328
01:42:29,100 --> 01:42:32,100
Nope. Target broke street.

1329
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:33,100
Yeah, they just...

1330
01:42:33,100 --> 01:42:36,100
That's exactly what I said when I found it earlier.

1331
01:42:36,100 --> 01:42:41,100
It doesn't come out until the 21st. It got pushed back because they weren't done with it yet. It hasn't even been pressed yet.

1332
01:42:41,100 --> 01:42:43,100
Wait, but how do they go to Target and get a copy then?

1333
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:45,100
I don't know if I know.

1334
01:42:45,100 --> 01:42:46,100
Interesting.

1335
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:50,820
They really did a really shitty job of making new box art for it.

1336
01:42:50,820 --> 01:42:52,260
Yeah, the cover art shit.

1337
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,340
So OK, give me this link.

1338
01:42:53,340 --> 01:42:54,340
I want to look at it.

1339
01:42:54,340 --> 01:42:55,020
Right there.

1340
01:42:55,020 --> 01:42:57,600
All right, let's see.

1341
01:42:57,600 --> 01:42:59,340
Let's see what this is all about right here.

1342
01:42:59,340 --> 01:43:03,620
OK, so this link got posted in our chat room, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

1343
01:43:07,020 --> 01:43:12,300
Orangelaungeradio.com slash chat, or I'm sorry, click on the link that says

1344
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:13,220
chat.

1345
01:43:13,220 --> 01:43:13,820
And here it is.

1346
01:43:13,820 --> 01:43:15,380
Somebody posted, go to Target now.

1347
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:19,020
They've got their little target bag with the receipt and the little game. We heart katamari

1348
01:43:19,700 --> 01:43:21,700
Sony software

1349
01:43:22,420 --> 01:43:24,220
$29.99

1350
01:43:24,220 --> 01:43:29,660
Interesting, I don't know whatever so they broke street date. Well, they don't really have street dates for games

1351
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:32,620
It's like kind of whenever they get them, but they're direct with the law

1352
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:35,300
Hello to people with different beg to differ with you

1353
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:41,020
Well some date some companies to street dated games, but this one's not supposed to come out until the 21st

1354
01:43:41,020 --> 01:43:43,140
that's the last info we got on it and

1355
01:43:43,140 --> 01:43:48,140
And that's straight from Namco. I mean, that's Namco people telling me, so...

1356
01:43:48,140 --> 01:43:49,140
That's very weird.

1357
01:43:49,140 --> 01:43:50,140
Yeah, that's understandable.

1358
01:43:50,140 --> 01:43:51,140
But, you know, street dates...

1359
01:43:51,140 --> 01:43:53,140
I'm heading up Target.com to see if it was just that store.

1360
01:43:53,140 --> 01:43:58,140
Street dates change all the time, and stuff gets sent out, you know, it'll go gold, you know.

1361
01:43:58,140 --> 01:44:01,140
Something will be pushed back, and then it'll come out that day, you know.

1362
01:44:01,140 --> 01:44:02,140
It's just, like, it's weird shit.

1363
01:44:02,140 --> 01:44:05,140
Like, for example, Graffiti Kingdom.

1364
01:44:05,140 --> 01:44:06,140
The company sent out press releases.

1365
01:44:06,140 --> 01:44:07,140
Oh, yeah, we shipped everything.

1366
01:44:07,140 --> 01:44:12,140
It didn't come out for two weeks later, you know, so it's hard to say.

1367
01:44:12,140 --> 01:44:14,140
Where's that dude live? Do we know?

1368
01:44:14,140 --> 01:44:19,140
I don't know. I just found the link early too when I was at my friend's dorm. We were playing video games.

1369
01:44:19,140 --> 01:44:21,140
Let's find out which Target that is.

1370
01:44:21,140 --> 01:44:26,140
Okay. Just to say something about on the Target website.

1371
01:44:26,140 --> 01:44:31,140
It says this item will be released on September 22nd and you can pre-order it.

1372
01:44:31,140 --> 01:44:32,140
Interesting.

1373
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:38,140
So it's just this one story. In Indianapolis, Indiana it looks like is where this person says they live.

1374
01:44:38,140 --> 01:44:44,980
So, if you are living in the Indianapolis area, start calling those targets and see

1375
01:44:44,980 --> 01:44:49,800
if you can't get your cams on the game because somehow they got a copy of it.

1376
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:54,380
Or it's a really cleverly done Photoshop, but I don't know why this guy would Photoshop

1377
01:44:54,380 --> 01:44:55,380
it.

1378
01:44:55,380 --> 01:44:58,100
No, it could also be like for some whatever reason they got a promo copy and the dumb

1379
01:44:58,100 --> 01:45:01,460
asses put it out the cell and that was like the only copy that they had.

1380
01:45:01,460 --> 01:45:02,460
Oh, I see.

1381
01:45:02,460 --> 01:45:03,460
But you never know.

1382
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:05,100
I mean, stupid things like that happen.

1383
01:45:05,100 --> 01:45:15,100
I noticed that on the receipt here, it says the Sony software, the actual name of the game isn't there, like it's a generic code in there or something.

1384
01:45:15,100 --> 01:45:21,100
But does it have what the disc number is? You know how each disc has an ID number on it?

1385
01:45:21,100 --> 01:45:22,100
Yeah, it had a little number on it, I think.

1386
01:45:22,100 --> 01:45:23,100
What's the number then?

1387
01:45:23,100 --> 01:45:24,100
Hey, there's a number there.

1388
01:45:24,100 --> 01:45:26,100
Hold on, hold on, let me check.

1389
01:45:26,100 --> 01:45:28,100
Ah, what a time for my mouse to be dying.

1390
01:45:28,100 --> 01:45:31,100
If I understand, somebody in California bought it.

1391
01:45:31,100 --> 01:45:39,740
That doesn't matter anyways, I have the Japanese version, I mean, what do I care?

1392
01:45:39,740 --> 01:45:44,860
I was just going to say, I was going to look up here, see if it matches, we live Katamari.

1393
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:49,740
Well, that's very interesting if it did come out a little early.

1394
01:45:49,740 --> 01:45:53,500
Some folks should just consider themselves lucky and maybe the game will be making its

1395
01:45:53,500 --> 01:45:59,740
way, but as far as we know, no official word from Namco or any gaming site for that matter

1396
01:45:59,740 --> 01:46:03,140
that the game has come out early. And I would think if the game shipped early, Namco would

1397
01:46:03,140 --> 01:46:06,280
be shouting it from the mountaintops and all the gaming sites would pick that up because

1398
01:46:06,280 --> 01:46:09,180
everybody has a boner for Katamari Damacy.

1399
01:46:09,180 --> 01:46:17,500
Perfect example. Look at Shane. He got someone returned to pump it up to one of the stores

1400
01:46:17,500 --> 01:46:22,380
and he bought it used. And this was before the game even came out. I mean, so, stuff

1401
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:27,260
like this happens. I mean, people will buy something or get something for free from,

1402
01:46:27,260 --> 01:46:30,900
You know, they're a distributor or a vendor or whatever and they'll return it back to

1403
01:46:30,900 --> 01:46:32,740
a store and then sell it.

1404
01:46:32,740 --> 01:46:36,960
Or in this case, they might get a promo copy early, because I've had, you know, a few copies

1405
01:46:36,960 --> 01:46:42,940
of stuff early before it's treated and, you know, someone goes and sells it or mistakenly

1406
01:46:42,940 --> 01:46:45,740
puts it out on the shelf, you never know.

1407
01:46:45,740 --> 01:46:52,680
Or whatever the company is, if they're shipping it in one day, you know.

1408
01:46:52,680 --> 01:46:55,580
Because I remember the same thing happened last year with the PS2 minis.

1409
01:46:55,580 --> 01:46:59,300
I mean, I found out that Target put it out three weeks early,

1410
01:46:59,300 --> 01:47:04,380
and then a week later, Best Buy, we put it out the following week.

1411
01:47:04,380 --> 01:47:05,180
Interesting.

1412
01:47:05,180 --> 01:47:07,260
Hey, chat room's bringing up an interesting point.

1413
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:09,900
Did you say your friend got this in California?

1414
01:47:09,900 --> 01:47:12,540
Yeah, that's what the receipt says.

1415
01:47:12,540 --> 01:47:16,060
Very interesting, but your friend's user info says he lives in, oh,

1416
01:47:16,060 --> 01:47:19,060
maybe he didn't buy this, but he found this picture somewhere.

1417
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:19,780
That could be it.

1418
01:47:19,780 --> 01:47:22,540
You can see on here, it says Mission Viejo.

1419
01:47:22,540 --> 01:47:25,060
Mission Viejo is right there on the, that's

1420
01:47:25,060 --> 01:47:29,300
the city in Southern California or San Diego San Diego area so if you in the

01:48:22,820 --> 01:48:28,020
on the receipt. Mission Viejo, California, see if they have Weheart, Katamari, and stuff.

1434
01:48:28,020 --> 01:48:30,820
Damn it, I just picked up another call. Zachary, you gotta call us back in a little bit, okay?

1435
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:35,940

1437
01:48:53,060 --> 01:48:59,900
three ringy dingys

1438
01:48:59,900 --> 01:49:01,100
Poor ringy dingies.

1439
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:08,300
Nobody's home at Target.

1440
01:49:11,700 --> 01:49:14,900
Apparently, yeah, they're too busy selling advanced copies of We Heart Katamari.

1441
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:18,700
Live radio, ladies and gentlemen.

1442
01:49:22,300 --> 01:49:24,100
Someone let Target know their phone's off the hook.

1443
01:49:24,100 --> 01:49:30,020
One more ring and then we're hanging up.

1444
01:49:30,020 --> 01:49:35,420
Very interesting. Not only that, but bad customer service.

1445
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:38,900
Maybe they're closed. They could close at eight on Sunday, I guess.

1446
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,220
No. Interesting.

1447
01:49:41,220 --> 01:49:46,220
Oh fuck, they're onto us.

1448
01:49:46,220 --> 01:49:47,860
Alright, we called. No answer.

1449
01:49:47,860 --> 01:49:49,100
What can we do?

1450
01:49:54,540 --> 01:49:55,540
So we'll see what happens.

1451
01:49:55,540 --> 01:49:56,180
Now the chat room is.

1452
01:49:56,180 --> 01:49:58,020
I'm looking through this one thread that was

1453
01:49:58,020 --> 01:50:00,220
linked in the chat room.

1454
01:50:00,220 --> 01:50:01,460
Are they saying the same thing?

1455
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:03,820
Someone actually had a very good challenge for the guy.

1456
01:50:03,820 --> 01:50:07,860
He said, post a copy of the, well, he put up a picture of

1457
01:50:07,860 --> 01:50:09,100
the disk in the manual.

1458
01:50:09,100 --> 01:50:10,300
One second.

1459
01:50:10,300 --> 01:50:11,020
Interesting.

1460
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,220
Well, let's see what happens.

1461
01:50:12,220 --> 01:50:13,780
All right, we're going to go to another call real quick

1462
01:50:13,780 --> 01:50:17,140
here, since our brilliant live radio experiment didn't work

1463
01:50:17,140 --> 01:50:21,860
out very well. Yeah, because really you could, I don't know. Hi, you're on Orange Launch

1464
01:50:21,860 --> 01:50:26,620
Radio. Yeah, you already know who this is. Hi, Saku, you know Target's closed, actually.

1465
01:50:26,620 --> 01:50:30,020
Yeah. I just wanted to share with you, Target's closed. Yeah, you're seven, you're about almost

1466
01:50:30,020 --> 01:50:36,340
20 minutes, you were like 20 minutes late right there. Well. Had you known this like,

1467
01:50:36,340 --> 01:50:40,940
maybe, you know, 20 minutes earlier, or probably 30 minutes earlier, you probably would've

1468
01:50:40,940 --> 01:50:47,940
Ron Chan, frickin' earlier next time. Be on time next time. No, I'm kidding, it's fine.

1469
01:50:47,940 --> 01:50:49,940
What's on your mind, Zaku?

1470
01:50:49,940 --> 01:50:56,940
Nah, just calling back. I'm in school right now. Moved back on campus a couple of weeks ago.

1471
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,940
Congratulations.

1472
01:50:58,940 --> 01:51:07,940
Yeah, and I still miss playing in the groove in the city. I miss that because I'm like 30 miles upstate from the city,

1473
01:51:07,940 --> 01:51:14,980
So we don't even have In the Groove up here, I mean we used to have, but you know, if I'm

1474
01:51:14,980 --> 01:51:18,060
going to get my fix I have to go back into the city and all.

1475
01:51:18,060 --> 01:51:21,780
Well one of these days I'm going to go down into Sacramento and play In the Groove 2 that

1476
01:51:21,780 --> 01:51:24,780
we have here, but I'm just lazy.

1477
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:26,540
What city is this so we can completely avoid it?

1478
01:51:26,540 --> 01:51:27,820
New York.

1479
01:51:27,820 --> 01:51:28,820
What city?

1480
01:51:28,820 --> 01:51:29,820
City of New York.

1481
01:51:29,820 --> 01:51:30,820
City City, New York?

1482
01:51:30,820 --> 01:51:31,940
Yeah, the city of New York.

1483
01:51:31,940 --> 01:51:34,460
I thought they had an In the Groove Chinatown.

1484
01:51:34,460 --> 01:51:40,460
Yes, not only that, but in Coney Island, Queens, Staten Island, I mean, it's starting to spread like cancer.

1485
01:51:40,460 --> 01:51:43,460
Interesting analogy!

1486
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:45,460
That's a lovely thought.

1487
01:51:45,460 --> 01:51:49,460
That and just missing playing 2DX11 Red, I just need that fixed.

1488
01:51:49,460 --> 01:51:51,460
So it's kind of spreading like New Jersey?

1489
01:51:51,460 --> 01:51:56,460
No, it's just spreading like your mama's legs! Oh, burn!

1490
01:51:56,460 --> 01:51:59,460
Nah, New Jersey's just the smell. I was in Philly.

1491
01:51:59,460 --> 01:52:03,540
yeah anyway what else is on your mind besides lack of the money

1492
01:52:03,540 --> 01:52:07,300
not just you know all that you should they just came out

1493
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:11,780
well the new info whatever you know I'm not gonna be able to make it to digital

1494
01:52:11,780 --> 01:52:12,180
life

1495
01:52:12,180 --> 01:52:17,060
I want to come sucks I tried to schedule my boss but she'd schedule me for a

1496
01:52:17,060 --> 01:52:20,300
full week class right there so I'm not gonna be able to do it mom but I hope you

1497
01:52:20,300 --> 01:52:23,180
guys have fun I tried I will I will definitely come next year

1498
01:52:23,180 --> 01:52:27,220
I know man we'll just hope it still happens next year

1499
01:52:27,220 --> 01:52:33,220
I hope so, too. Well, we need somebody on the inside taking some pictures and sending them to us, so take some pictures over there.

1500
01:52:33,220 --> 01:52:35,220
I wish I had a digital camera.

1501
01:52:35,220 --> 01:52:36,220
Are you practicing for your freestyle?

1502
01:52:36,220 --> 01:52:39,220
Uh, I don't know about that. I need a job first.

1503
01:52:39,220 --> 01:52:40,220
Oh.

1504
01:52:40,220 --> 01:52:41,220
I'm still unemployed.

1505
01:52:41,220 --> 01:52:42,220
Oh.

1506
01:52:42,220 --> 01:52:43,220
Get your resume on Monster.

1507
01:52:43,220 --> 01:52:44,220
Hey, join the club!

1508
01:52:44,220 --> 01:52:45,220
Nine months now.

1509
01:52:45,220 --> 01:52:46,220
Get your resume on Monster.

1510
01:52:46,220 --> 01:52:47,220
And Craigslist.

1511
01:52:47,220 --> 01:52:49,220
Dude, I've tried that already.

1512
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:59,220
When you've been trying to find work for the past nine months, you kind of realize that there's probably no light at the end of the tunnel.

1513
01:52:59,220 --> 01:53:04,220
And to make it worse, I don't even get work study this year.

1514
01:53:04,220 --> 01:53:09,220
You know what? Apply at Target because you'll never have to work past eight on a Sunday.

1515
01:53:09,220 --> 01:53:13,220
You'll always be home in time for Orange Line.

1516
01:53:13,220 --> 01:53:20,220
I just hope so. I hope they don't make me work on, I don't know about making me work on weekends. I hope I can find a job that revolves around my schedule.

1517
01:53:20,220 --> 01:53:27,220
Well, there are some employers out there that will work with you if you're in school. It's possible to find, but you know, you are going to have to kind of look at the bottom.

1518
01:53:27,220 --> 01:53:32,220
And a lot of schools also have temporary services where you can actually work on campus around your own hours.

1519
01:53:32,220 --> 01:53:39,220
I've already exhausted those means of working on campus. They've already filled, I mean the jobs have already filled up.

1520
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:43,660
and people want work-study, you know, in order to be tired.

1521
01:53:43,660 --> 01:53:46,140
Stop, stop.

1522
01:53:46,140 --> 01:53:50,300
Yeah, it's really bad for me because I probably waited like almost a week to

1523
01:53:50,300 --> 01:53:52,140
even be, you know, to even

1524
01:53:52,140 --> 01:53:56,180
you know, find out that I didn't have work-study, so

1525
01:53:56,180 --> 01:54:00,100
as I said, I'm up a shit's creek right now. I'm just hoping I get some

1526
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,440
jobs that I applied to

1527
01:54:02,440 --> 01:54:05,460
and we'll see what happens from there. Well, good luck to you.

1528
01:54:05,460 --> 01:54:09,940
I hope that, you know, you find something. Just check with the big, big companies, like,

1529
01:54:09,940 --> 01:54:13,380
you know, the Targets, the Walmarts, the Toys R Us's, and whatever, so.

1530
01:54:13,380 --> 01:54:21,980
Alright, well, have a good one, Zaku, and good luck on the job hunt, and hope you find

1531
01:54:21,980 --> 01:54:29,340
those Bonwani games, okay? Alright, later, bye.

1532
01:54:29,340 --> 01:54:34,540
Okay, now, on the chat room, it sounds like that they actually looked up this Target,

1533
01:54:34,540 --> 01:54:38,660
and the damn store is open. So is there only one target in Mission Viejo, or is there more

1534
01:54:38,660 --> 01:54:44,300
than one target? See, maybe there's more than one target in the town, so the one you guys

1535
01:54:44,300 --> 01:54:47,140
are looking at might not be the right one. But Mission Viejo is not that big, is it?

1536
01:54:47,140 --> 01:54:49,380
I don't think it is. Don't know.

1537
01:54:49,380 --> 01:54:54,300
On that one thread, by the way, someone said they worked at Target and got a shipment of

1538
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:57,860
it in, so went ahead and bought us a game. Really?

1539
01:54:57,860 --> 01:55:02,040
They said they got very few copies in. Interesting. Okay, well, here's the correct

1540
01:55:02,040 --> 01:55:06,040
Maybe, did we mis-dial their number? Let me look at what we dialed last time.

1541
01:55:06,040 --> 01:55:10,040
949, oh, we totally dialed the wrong number last time. Well, let's try it again.

1542
01:55:10,040 --> 01:55:14,040
Okay, now we've got the right target number. Thank you,

1543
01:55:14,040 --> 01:55:18,040
chat room.

1544
01:55:22,040 --> 01:55:26,040
Thank you for calling the Mission Viejo Target Store. Our normal

1545
01:55:26,040 --> 01:55:30,040
store business hours are Monday through Saturday,

1546
01:55:30,040 --> 01:55:38,040
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

1547
01:55:38,040 --> 01:55:44,040
We are located on Alicia Parkway off the 5 freeway between Charlinda and the 5 freeway.

1548
01:55:44,040 --> 01:55:48,040
If you are calling the Target Pharmacy, please press 1.

1549
01:55:48,040 --> 01:55:54,040
If you speak to the store operator, please wait or press 0.

1550
01:55:54,040 --> 01:55:59,040
I guess we get the operator.

1551
01:55:59,040 --> 01:56:03,040
Please stay on the line while your call is transferred to the operator.

1552
01:56:12,040 --> 01:56:15,040
Good evening Target, this is Sue, how can I direct your call?

1553
01:56:15,040 --> 01:56:18,040
Yes, can I speak to somebody in electronics please?

1554
01:56:18,040 --> 01:56:19,040
Sure.

1555
01:56:25,040 --> 01:56:26,040
Electronics?

1556
01:56:26,040 --> 01:56:32,040
Yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock. It's We Love Katamari.

1557
01:56:32,040 --> 01:56:34,040
Let me check, hang on.

1558
01:56:34,040 --> 01:56:39,040
Yeah, I see. Those are on the next aisle.

1559
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,040
I'm sorry, what was the game again?

1560
01:56:41,040 --> 01:56:44,040
It's We Love Katamari.

1561
01:56:44,040 --> 01:56:46,040
Yeah, we have one left.

1562
01:56:46,040 --> 01:56:47,040
You do have one left in stock.

1563
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,040
Yes, we do.

1564
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:49,040
Okay, great. Thank you.

1565
01:56:49,040 --> 01:56:50,040
Uh-huh.

1566
01:56:50,040 --> 01:56:52,040
Alright, bye-bye.

1567
01:56:52,040 --> 01:56:54,040
One left, kids! Get your asses in gear!

1568
01:56:54,040 --> 01:56:58,040
here and get down there and pick that shit up. One left in stock.

1569
01:56:58,040 --> 01:57:02,040
I'll have to talk to my folks at Namco and see what's going on.

1570
01:57:02,040 --> 01:57:06,040
Go figure. You heard it here first, boys and girls.

1571
01:57:06,040 --> 01:57:10,040
We gonna rat them out, yo. We frickin' called them

1572
01:57:10,040 --> 01:57:14,040
and they have one copy left in stock. You go post that on Game Tax right now.

1573
01:57:14,040 --> 01:57:18,040
I think I'm gonna make a stop by Target tomorrow after I get out from the chiropractor.

1574
01:57:18,040 --> 01:57:22,040
You want to call the one down up the street here?

1575
01:57:22,040 --> 01:57:30,040
Dude, if they have it, I'm going to give Neil money to get mine now.

1576
01:57:30,040 --> 01:57:35,040
Except that I have mine on reserve at GameStop and I can get it for 30% off.

1577
01:57:35,040 --> 01:57:37,040
Are we going to call him right now?

1578
01:57:37,040 --> 01:57:41,040
Well, it's 30% off later or full price now.

1579
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:44,040
I can't believe we're doing this live on air.

1580
01:57:44,040 --> 01:57:47,040
I think we have better things to talk about.

1581
01:57:47,040 --> 01:57:49,040
But dammit, we might get our Katamari fix tonight.

1582
01:57:49,040 --> 01:57:50,040
Alright, here's the number, Neil.

1583
01:57:50,040 --> 01:57:51,480
We caught a Mario ready!

1584
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:52,600
I'm calling GameStop real quick.

1585
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:57,320
6384971.

1586
01:57:57,320 --> 01:57:58,440
All right.

1587
01:57:58,440 --> 01:57:59,480
Bugs going to call him.

1588
01:57:59,480 --> 01:58:02,200
And in the meantime, we're going to go to a break.

1589
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:03,160
When we come back from the break,

1590
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:04,000
we'll let you know what happened.

1591
01:58:04,000 --> 01:58:05,960
And we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

1592
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,520
And we've got a couple other Bamani stories

1593
01:58:07,520 --> 01:58:08,560
for you guys tonight.

1594
01:58:08,560 --> 01:58:10,440
So we will be back after this.

1595
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:13,240
Started off with a little bit of the captain, the good captain

1596
01:58:13,240 --> 01:58:14,240
here.

1597
01:58:14,240 --> 01:58:16,160
You listening to Orange Lounge Radio?

1598
01:58:16,160 --> 01:58:37,760
Dream on, dream on, but take me in a dream Take me anywhere you please, boy you're making me scream Dream on, dream on, but nothing's just a dream If you want to set me free, boy you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da You've got to dream on, dream on, dream on

1599
01:58:46,160 --> 01:58:59,160
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

1600
01:58:59,160 --> 01:59:05,160
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get ready or this is it

1601
01:59:05,160 --> 01:59:07,160
Do you like the dream?

1602
01:59:07,160 --> 01:59:10,160
Hey, I like the dream baby Do you like the dream?

1603
01:59:10,160 --> 01:59:14,160
Oh, I like the dream mama Do you like the scream?

1604
01:59:14,160 --> 01:59:19,160
Hey, I like to scream, baby Do you like to scream? Oh, scream it out

1605
01:59:19,160 --> 01:59:26,160
Dream of a dream of a living in your dreams It's the end of real things for you making me scream

1606
01:59:26,160 --> 01:59:33,160
Dream of dreams of the nothing but the dream If you want to let me scream for you making me scream

1607
02:02:33,160 --> 02:02:38,160
I'm feeling all like a robot, yeah

1608
02:02:51,160 --> 02:02:53,160
Baby do you want the truth?

1609
02:02:53,160 --> 02:02:55,160
Baby do you want it?

1610
02:02:55,160 --> 02:02:57,160
Baby do you want the truth?

1611
02:02:57,160 --> 02:02:58,440
7, 2, 1

1612
02:04:27,160 --> 02:04:32,160
When you ask me to do my own thing, it's a lie

1613
02:04:32,160 --> 02:04:35,160
So I quit, it's a lie

1614
02:05:05,160 --> 02:05:21,000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and the hunt is on.

1615
02:05:21,000 --> 02:05:24,520
I think I've heard about five different Target stores being called in the area during that

1616
02:05:24,520 --> 02:05:26,200
break looking for We Heart Katamari.

1617
02:05:26,200 --> 02:05:29,600
Of course, if you're just joining us, we actually called.

1618
02:05:29,600 --> 02:05:30,880
There was a picture on the internet.

1619
02:05:30,880 --> 02:05:36,800
Some kid said he went to the Mission Viejo California Target Store, looked for a copy

1620
02:05:36,800 --> 02:05:41,100
of We Heart Katamari and he got it and we just called because we thought that this whole

1621
02:05:41,100 --> 02:05:42,560
thing might have been bogus or BS.

1622
02:05:42,560 --> 02:05:46,700
We called and the guy, they didn't know that we were a radio show or anything, we just

1623
02:05:46,700 --> 02:05:49,700
called and the guy said one copy left.

1624
02:05:49,700 --> 02:05:56,880
So if you're lucky enough to be in the San Diego Mission Viejo area, get your ass a target

1625
02:05:56,880 --> 02:06:08,280
before nine o'clock and you can thank us later. That's great. All right. You know what's sad

1626
02:06:08,280 --> 02:06:12,720
is after we cover that on our podcast tonight, that poor store is going to get a shitload

1627
02:06:12,720 --> 02:06:19,240
of inquiries about that game. Power of the internet. You know what's sad also? I'm going

1628
02:06:19,240 --> 02:06:23,320
to rat them out. Don't rat them out. Oh yeah, I'm ratting them out. Don't rat them out.

1629
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:26,120
I'm ratting them out. Wait until somebody picks up that game because maybe it'll be

1630
02:06:26,120 --> 02:06:27,120
good enough to give us an iso.

1631
02:06:27,120 --> 02:06:28,120
Well, then they better hurry.

1632
02:06:28,120 --> 02:06:29,120
I'm gonna random out.

1633
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:30,120
Cause, you know, Namco's gonna call tomorrow.

1634
02:06:30,120 --> 02:06:31,120
We'll see what happens.

1635
02:06:31,120 --> 02:06:32,120
Nah, I don't care, really.

1636
02:06:32,120 --> 02:06:33,120
Well, actually, what's interesting is that, um, uh, the only reason I'd be pissed off

1637
02:06:33,120 --> 02:06:34,120
is because we didn't get ours on time.

1638
02:06:34,120 --> 02:06:35,120
Because, you know, it was supposed to come out, you know, I think, last week, and they

1639
02:06:35,120 --> 02:06:36,120
pushed it back.

1640
02:06:36,120 --> 02:06:37,120
So, you know what?

1641
02:06:37,120 --> 02:06:38,120
That's my bitterness.

1642
02:06:38,120 --> 02:06:39,120
Thanks.

1643
02:06:39,120 --> 02:06:40,120
Thanks.

1644
02:06:40,120 --> 02:06:41,120
Bye.

1645
02:06:41,120 --> 02:06:42,120
Bye.

1646
02:06:42,120 --> 02:06:43,120
Bye.

1647
02:06:43,120 --> 02:06:44,120
Bye.

1648
02:06:44,120 --> 02:06:45,120
Bye.

1649
02:06:45,120 --> 02:06:50,680
to come out you know I think last week and they pushed it back so you know what

1650
02:06:50,680 --> 02:07:04,920
that's my bitterness all right the chat rooms yelling at us here I don't know if

1651
02:07:04,920 --> 02:07:11,960
somebody lives in that area or something we'll see um doo-doo-doo-doo where was I

1652
02:07:11,960 --> 02:07:16,520
lost track now because of all this we heart katamari madness here let me post

1653
02:07:16,520 --> 02:07:21,000
that link one more time for you guys looking for that mission Viejo target I

1654
02:07:21,000 --> 02:07:25,160
have a slight update there's one in the area they have them in they have them

1655
02:07:25,160 --> 02:07:29,080
but they aren't putting them out on the shelf till Tuesday till Tuesday till

1656
02:07:29,080 --> 02:07:32,960
this Tuesday okay who's doing it Roseville the old one the old Roseville

1657
02:07:32,960 --> 02:07:38,720
one interesting because there's like two or three in Roseville now huh so that's

1658
02:07:38,720 --> 02:07:40,720
That's the one on Douglas Boulevard.

1659
02:07:40,720 --> 02:07:42,720
Interesting.

1660
02:07:42,720 --> 02:07:46,720
Do you have a game called We Love Katamari for PS2 and stuff?

1661
02:07:46,720 --> 02:07:49,720
So it's somehow getting out early to targets?

1662
02:07:49,720 --> 02:07:51,720
Yeah.

1663
02:07:51,720 --> 02:07:53,720
Just cover them by my house and they don't...

1664
02:07:53,720 --> 02:07:54,720
Interesting.

1665
02:07:54,720 --> 02:07:56,720
Alright.

1666
02:07:56,720 --> 02:08:00,720
There's going to be some calls made this morning. Let me put it that way.

1667
02:08:00,720 --> 02:08:07,720
Do you know the other thought is that what if Namco is purposefully leaking this out to produce excitement over the game's release?

1668
02:08:07,720 --> 02:08:10,720
I don't think so. They're not that smart.

1669
02:08:10,720 --> 02:08:13,720
Actually, I worked for Namco and yes, they've done stuff like this in the past.

1670
02:08:13,720 --> 02:08:15,720
I don't think so. I doubt it.

1671
02:08:15,720 --> 02:08:22,720
I think this is just more of an error in someone's shipping department.

1672
02:08:22,720 --> 02:08:25,720
Now the chat room's going, call my target. Call my target.

1673
02:08:25,720 --> 02:08:28,720
Fuck you. Call your own target. Seriously.

1674
02:08:28,720 --> 02:08:30,720
The hell? We're not calling all your damn targets.

1675
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:35,720
We are not the goddamn operator. Call your own fucking target.

1676
02:08:35,720 --> 02:08:40,360
Pick up your phone, dial the little numbers, and ask them yourself, just like we did with

1677
02:08:40,360 --> 02:08:41,360
six different stores.

1678
02:08:41,360 --> 02:08:42,360
Thank you.

1679
02:08:42,360 --> 02:08:44,980
You see how easy it is?

1680
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:46,160
I did it.

1681
02:08:46,160 --> 02:08:47,160
You can do it.

1682
02:08:47,160 --> 02:08:49,160
The phone is easy to use.

1683
02:08:49,160 --> 02:08:53,960
You learn how to do this when you're three.

1684
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:54,960
Hit the button.

1685
02:08:54,960 --> 02:08:57,960
If you have that much trouble, get your mommy to call.

1686
02:08:57,960 --> 02:09:02,760
You shouldn't be getting this game anyways if you have that much trouble dialing a phone.

1687
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:07,760
Obviously don't have the hand-eye coordination enough to use the controller to play the game.

1688
02:09:07,760 --> 02:09:14,760
If you're having trouble using the phone, you've got a serious problem, and you probably need help going P2.

1689
02:09:14,760 --> 02:09:19,760
Do you need someone to help you do the wipe? Or how about the flush?

1690
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:25,760
Alright, we're getting like a million requests for the clip of the phone call.

1691
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:30,760
So we'll, I don't know, put it in the live chat. Please!

1692
02:09:30,760 --> 02:09:38,840
Post it to our forums, please, because my work firewalled live journals, so I can't

1693
02:09:38,840 --> 02:09:39,840
do that no more.

1694
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,840
We'll see.

1695
02:09:40,840 --> 02:09:41,840
Shame on them.

1696
02:09:41,840 --> 02:09:42,840
We'll see what we can do.

1697
02:09:42,840 --> 02:09:47,700
Because I have a certain person I would like to send that to that, you know, is certain

1698
02:09:47,700 --> 02:09:51,560
on certain street dates, and I would like to forward that to them, and that would be

1699
02:09:51,560 --> 02:09:52,560
hilarious.

1700
02:09:52,560 --> 02:09:53,560
All right.

1701
02:09:53,560 --> 02:09:59,400
We're going to get into the cage match, but we can't figure out where Loki's song went.

1702
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:01,400
Do you have a new song for us?

1703
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:02,400
From my cage match?

1704
02:10:02,400 --> 02:10:03,400
Yeah.

1705
02:10:03,400 --> 02:10:04,400
Yeah, I have a new one.

1706
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:05,400
I didn't even realize it one last time.

1707
02:10:05,400 --> 02:10:08,400
Technically, your song, whatever it was, should have been retired.

1708
02:10:08,400 --> 02:10:10,400
Yeah, I have a new song that I'm picking.

1709
02:10:10,400 --> 02:10:11,400
Alright, good.

1710
02:10:11,400 --> 02:10:12,400
It's on one of those CDs, actually.

1711
02:10:12,400 --> 02:10:13,400
Oh, good.

1712
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:14,400
Which one?

1713
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,400
This is great radio, by the way.

1714
02:10:15,400 --> 02:10:16,400
It was a good, cool one.

1715
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:19,400
Oh, the one that should be already in there.

1716
02:10:19,400 --> 02:10:20,400
Alrighty.

1717
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,400
It's actually on both of them, so it doesn't really matter.

1718
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:23,400
Okay, sounds good.

1719
02:10:23,400 --> 02:10:26,400
Alright, we're going to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1720
02:10:26,400 --> 02:10:30,400
We're starting fresh this week because we did go two weeks without a show.

1721
02:10:30,400 --> 02:10:34,400
So we're just going to go ahead and kind of restart tonight with the cage match.

1722
02:10:34,400 --> 02:10:38,400
And it goes a little something like this.

1723
02:10:38,400 --> 02:10:42,400
All right.

1724
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:46,400
Here's the deal. Join our chat room,

1725
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:50,400
www.orangelaungeradio.com. We're going to play three songs for you guys.

1726
02:10:50,400 --> 02:10:54,400
And you guys get to pick your favorite. And the winning song goes into rotation

1727
02:10:54,400 --> 02:10:59,240
All week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bhavani and Video Game Music Show, which plays 24

1728
02:10:59,240 --> 02:11:04,000
hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we are not live.

1729
02:11:04,000 --> 02:11:07,220
So we're going to start off with three brand new songs tonight for you to pick from.

1730
02:11:07,220 --> 02:11:09,400
There is no reigning champion.

1731
02:11:09,400 --> 02:11:13,160
We'll start off tonight with Dark Sakura's pick, since she's the only one that has her

1732
02:11:13,160 --> 02:11:14,160
pick up and ready to go.

1733
02:11:14,160 --> 02:11:16,160
So we're going to start off with her.

1734
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:17,800
I had it already last week.

1735
02:11:17,800 --> 02:11:19,720
But you know, we won't talk about last week.

1736
02:11:19,720 --> 02:11:21,560
So what did you pick for us, Dark Sakura?

1737
02:11:21,560 --> 02:11:33,560
Um, it's by a Czech group called Aksent, sorry, and this is a really weird video with a look-alike like Kylie Minogue in it, and these guys kept making out with her, and it's called Kylie.

1738
02:11:33,560 --> 02:11:36,560
Interesting. So it's like a Kylie Minogue worship song?

1739
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:37,560
Yeah.

1740
02:11:37,560 --> 02:11:38,560
This should be pretty rad.

1741
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:40,560
Actually, this is the English version.

1742
02:11:40,560 --> 02:11:41,560
Alright.

1743
02:11:41,560 --> 02:11:48,560
I haven't listened to it all below through yet, but I listened to the Czech version, and I didn't shoot any of it, so here you go.

1744
02:11:48,560 --> 02:11:49,560
Alright.

1745
02:11:49,560 --> 02:11:53,560
Here we go, song number one tonight, Accents with Kylie.

1746
02:12:19,560 --> 02:12:47,960
Maybe you're the one that made my heart I swear I'm not lying

1747
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:52,960
Maybe, tonight I'm gonna try my luck

1748
02:12:52,960 --> 02:12:55,960
I can see that you want me

1749
02:12:55,960 --> 02:13:02,960
I'm dreaming about you every night, every night

1750
02:13:02,960 --> 02:13:06,960
Fighting gives me just a chance, let's go out and dance

1751
02:13:06,960 --> 02:13:10,960
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

1752
02:13:10,960 --> 02:13:14,960
Later you can sing to me, like a shining star

1753
02:13:14,960 --> 02:13:17,960
But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car

1754
02:13:17,960 --> 02:13:21,960
Try to give me just a chance, let's go out and dance

1755
02:13:21,960 --> 02:13:25,960
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

1756
02:13:25,960 --> 02:13:29,960
Later you can sing to me like a shining star

1757
02:13:29,960 --> 02:13:33,560
I'd rather know you're on the back seat of my car

1758
02:13:51,260 --> 02:13:55,960
Baby, take a minute, check me out

1759
02:13:56,760 --> 02:13:58,760
I see you in the front row

1760
02:13:58,760 --> 02:14:03,760
Baby, I'm the coolest guy in the crowd

1761
02:14:03,760 --> 02:14:06,760
I'm sure you have seen me

1762
02:14:06,760 --> 02:14:13,760
I'm dreaming about you every night, every night

1763
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,760
Skydee give me just a chance, let's go out and dance

1764
02:14:17,760 --> 02:14:21,760
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

1765
02:14:21,760 --> 02:14:25,760
Later you can sing to me like a shining star

1766
02:14:25,760 --> 02:14:29,200
But I'd rather, know you on the back-feet of my car

1767
02:14:29,200 --> 02:14:32,960
Hiding gives me just a chance, let's go out and dance

1768
02:14:32,960 --> 02:14:36,800
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

1769
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:40,640
Later you can sing to me, like a shining star

1770
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:45,200
But I'd rather, know you on the back-feet of my car

1771
02:14:45,200 --> 02:14:49,120
You drive me crazy, you slowly drive me crazy

1772
02:14:49,120 --> 02:14:52,880
Red blooded paper, can't get you off my mind

1773
02:14:52,880 --> 02:14:56,380
I used to be lucky, I used to be so lucky

1774
02:14:56,380 --> 02:15:00,380
I used to be lucky to sleep with you tonight

1775
02:15:00,380 --> 02:15:26,780
Let's go out and dance We can get into the groove

1776
02:15:26,780 --> 02:15:28,380
I can watch you move

1777
02:15:28,480 --> 02:15:30,480
Later you can sing to me

1778
02:15:30,580 --> 02:15:32,380
Like a shining star

1779
02:15:32,480 --> 02:15:34,280
But I rather

1780
02:15:34,380 --> 02:15:44,900
Know you're on the back

1781
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:47,780
I rather

1782
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:49,420
But I rather

1783
02:15:49,500 --> 02:15:50,420
Know you're on the back

1784
02:15:50,520 --> 02:15:52,420
Take off my car

1785
02:15:52,420 --> 02:16:07,660
Alright though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Accent with Kylie. Let's go around

1786
02:16:07,660 --> 02:16:10,740
and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Dark Sakura.

1787
02:16:10,740 --> 02:16:15,780
That song is great. I mean, the style's kind of, you know, an older style, but the song's

1788
02:16:15,780 --> 02:16:21,060
relatively new, and the video's freaking hilarious, so it gets a 9.5.

1789
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:49,660
I have to agree with Arcadian42 in our chatroom who said this song is fruity. However, for

1790
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:53,460
For that reason, I loved it. It was great. It was a great cage match song, honestly.

1791
02:16:53,460 --> 02:16:55,460
It was funny and it was dancey. Nine and a half.

1792
02:16:55,460 --> 02:16:57,460
I'm putting the video in the chatroom, by the way.

1793
02:16:57,460 --> 02:17:01,460
Alright. But, there are still two more songs to go. Who knows?

1794
02:17:01,460 --> 02:17:04,460
We may have something a little better. We won't find out. It's your call.

1795
02:17:04,460 --> 02:17:07,060
Song number two is Loki's pick. What'd you pick for us, Loki?

1796
02:17:07,060 --> 02:17:11,860
Some off the Good Cool Xpander CD. I don't really like Eurobeat.

1797
02:17:11,860 --> 02:17:17,860
And this is a trance remix of Blame. So, by Good Cool.

1798
02:17:17,860 --> 02:17:22,860
Alright, here it is. Blame the trance mix by Good Cool.

1799
02:17:47,860 --> 02:17:55,860
will last, deep within my mind I will always find you, you should still remain

1800
02:17:55,860 --> 02:18:02,860
All my heart still yearns to testify still, but I can't put up the blame

1801
02:18:02,860 --> 02:18:07,860
I would never ever do to leave me with a mental wound

1802
02:18:07,860 --> 02:18:14,860
To love the reason why I can't forgive and forgive

1803
02:18:14,860 --> 02:18:17,860
You have left me sad for life,

1804
02:18:17,860 --> 02:18:20,860
Your fear to wake up like a night.

1805
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:27,860
I can't forgive and forget.

1806
02:18:38,860 --> 02:18:40,860
I thought I would heal,

1807
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:45,660
But I only feel my conscience reminisce

1808
02:18:45,660 --> 02:18:48,560
I knew that I would fall for you

1809
02:18:48,560 --> 02:18:51,660
But nothing's quite like this

1810
02:18:51,660 --> 02:18:54,860
Why can't I hide what's deep inside?

1811
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:58,260
The feelings never fade

1812
02:18:58,260 --> 02:19:00,960
Look and see what you've done to me

1813
02:19:00,960 --> 02:19:04,660
The impact that you've made

1814
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:08,360
I would never have assumed you'd need me

1815
02:19:08,360 --> 02:19:16,880
With a mental wound, still love the reason why I kept on giving for days

1816
02:19:16,880 --> 02:19:23,280
You have left me sad for life, come sit and wake up like a night

1817
02:19:23,280 --> 02:19:29,280
I can't forgive it for you

1818
02:19:53,280 --> 02:20:06,280
Keep me in my mind, I will always find emotions still remain

1819
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:13,280
Oh, my heart's too young to get the vibe still, but I can't put up the blame

1820
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:18,480
I would never, ever assume to leave me with a mental wound

1821
02:20:18,480 --> 02:20:24,880
You never will realize why I can't forgive and forget

1822
02:20:24,880 --> 02:20:31,280
You never did not look like something you would not like to see

1823
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:37,680
I can't forgive and forget

1824
02:20:37,680 --> 02:20:43,280
I would never have assumed you'd leave me with a mental wound

1825
02:20:43,280 --> 02:20:49,280
You know the reason why I can't forgive and forget

1826
02:20:49,880 --> 02:20:52,580
You have left me bad for life

1827
02:20:52,580 --> 02:20:56,180
Consider what God's like at night

1828
02:20:56,180 --> 02:21:02,680
I can't forgive and forget

1829
02:21:02,680 --> 02:21:30,680
You've only got yourself to blame.

1830
02:21:30,680 --> 02:21:35,680
...

1831
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:40,680
...

1832
02:21:40,680 --> 02:21:45,680
...

1833
02:21:45,680 --> 02:21:50,680
...

1834
02:21:50,680 --> 02:21:55,680
...

1835
02:21:55,680 --> 02:22:25,560
Alrighty, that was song number two of Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Koot.

1836
02:22:25,560 --> 02:22:29,560
Blame, a trance remix. Interesting. Let's see, Dark Sakura.

1837
02:22:29,560 --> 02:22:35,560
So it sounded like Eurobeat with extra, different, Eurobeat with different synths.

1838
02:22:35,560 --> 02:22:41,560
So, yeah, it was okay, because I really like Blame, but I actually like the Eurobeat version better.

1839
02:22:41,560 --> 02:22:44,560
So it gets a seven and a half.

1840
02:22:44,560 --> 02:22:45,560
Loki.

1841
02:22:45,560 --> 02:22:50,560
It's a nine, because I've been blasting this in my car with the windows down, driving. It's fun.

1842
02:22:50,560 --> 02:23:00,560
I didn't like it as much as the Kylie song, but I kinda dug it. It was pretty cool. I'll give it an 8.5.

1843
02:23:20,560 --> 02:23:26,160
which didn't get a single vote from any of you so I said f you all the next cage

1844
02:23:26,160 --> 02:23:34,120
match I'm gonna play some shitty so here it is the band is m3 Halina Walsh and

1845
02:23:34,120 --> 02:23:39,200
Stacey D I have no idea what kind of name that is but it's m3 Halina Walsh

1846
02:23:39,200 --> 02:23:45,440
and Stacey D it's called I touch myself the love to infinity radio mix and yes

1847
02:23:45,440 --> 02:23:51,080
it is an update of that song. Song number three.

1848
02:24:15,440 --> 02:24:22,440
I want you to find me, I'll forget myself I want you to remind me

1849
02:24:22,440 --> 02:24:29,440
I don't want anybody else When I think about you, I'll touch myself

1850
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:36,440
I don't want anybody else I don't want anybody else

1851
02:25:06,440 --> 02:25:13,440
You're the sun who makes me shine When you're around, I'm always laughing

1852
02:25:13,440 --> 02:25:20,440
I wanna make you mine I close my eyes and see you before me

1853
02:25:20,440 --> 02:25:28,440
Think I would die if you were to ignore me If I could see just how much I adore you

1854
02:25:28,440 --> 02:25:32,440
I can tell you my needs, I'd do anything for you

1855
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:36,060
I don't want anybody else

1856
02:25:36,060 --> 02:25:39,420
When I think about you, I next myself

1857
02:25:39,420 --> 02:25:44,280
Whoa I don't want anybody else

1858
02:25:44,280 --> 02:25:46,700
Oh no, oh no yeah

1859
02:25:46,700 --> 02:25:49,040
I'll touch my left hand

1860
02:25:49,040 --> 02:25:52,680
Anybody, I'll touch my left hand

1861
02:25:52,680 --> 02:25:56,580
Yeah anybody, I'll touch my left hand

1862
02:25:56,580 --> 02:25:59,960
Yeah, anybody, I touch my left hand

1863
02:25:59,960 --> 02:26:01,960
Anybody else?

1864
02:26:08,960 --> 02:26:10,960
I love myself

1865
02:26:10,960 --> 02:26:12,960
I want you to love me

1866
02:26:12,960 --> 02:26:13,960
When I feel down

1867
02:26:13,960 --> 02:26:15,960
I want you to overburden me

1868
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:17,960
I search myself

1869
02:26:17,960 --> 02:26:19,960
I want you to find me

1870
02:26:19,960 --> 02:26:21,960
I forget myself

1871
02:26:21,960 --> 02:26:23,960
I want you to remind me

1872
02:26:25,960 --> 02:26:26,960
I want you

1873
02:26:26,960 --> 02:26:28,960
I don'tbODY ELSE

1874
02:26:28,960 --> 02:26:30,960
When I think about you

1875
02:26:30,960 --> 02:26:32,960
I touch myself

1876
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:36,960
Oooooh

1877
02:26:36,960 --> 02:26:41,960
I don't want anybody else

1878
02:26:41,960 --> 02:26:43,960
When I think about you

1879
02:26:43,960 --> 02:26:45,960
I touch myself

1880
02:26:45,960 --> 02:26:49,960
I don't want anybody else

1881
02:26:49,960 --> 02:26:51,960
I don't, Oh no

1882
02:26:51,960 --> 02:26:53,960
I touch myself

1883
02:27:23,960 --> 02:27:32,960
Alrighty. That was song number three in tonight's cage match. Where's my background? There we go.

1884
02:27:32,960 --> 02:27:39,960
Song number three in tonight's cage match, I Touched Myself by M3, Helena Walsh, and Stacey D.

1885
02:27:39,960 --> 02:27:41,960
I touched myself right in the eye.

1886
02:27:41,960 --> 02:27:43,960
Dark Sakura, what did you think?

1887
02:27:43,960 --> 02:27:53,960
I wanted to cry, because they took a song that was excellent in its original form, and made it into just generic trance crap. So it gets a 3.

1888
02:27:53,960 --> 02:27:55,960
Loki!

1889
02:27:55,960 --> 02:28:01,960
It's remix by numbers. Take song, add different backbeat, done.

1890
02:28:01,960 --> 02:28:05,960
Uh, I didn't like it. It made me feel-

1891
02:28:05,960 --> 02:28:14,960
It was like that song was the whole, and seven days later I'm going to become gay having listened to that song, so I can't get to six.

1892
02:28:14,960 --> 02:28:16,960
Bugged.

1893
02:28:16,960 --> 02:28:22,960
Yeah, I touch myself in the eye and then the nose, and yeah. Two.

1894
02:28:22,960 --> 02:28:28,960
That's the kind of song I would clean house while dancing around in my underwear, too. I give it a seven.

1895
02:28:28,960 --> 02:28:31,960
I do not need that imagery!

1896
02:28:31,960 --> 02:28:36,960
And yes you're welcome for that special imagery brought to you by me.

1897
02:28:36,960 --> 02:28:40,440
Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

And song number two you can vote for tonight is Good Cool with Chorus K with Blame the

1902
02:29:24,040 --> 02:29:31,120
Alright kids, place vote now. Send a private message to Skye in the chat room with your

1903
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,120

1904
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:35,840
We have to play this song now. What song is this?

1905
02:29:35,840 --> 02:29:36,840
The V-Rare stuff.

1906
02:29:36,840 --> 02:29:38,840
Oh, we'll get to the V-Rare.

1907
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:41,880
That's because I found that song that I was talking to you about. Remember when we were

1908
02:29:41,880 --> 02:29:45,440
sitting at E3 and we were watching, you know, the Groovilooz do their thing up there in

1909
02:29:45,440 --> 02:29:50,440
that song? I'm like, that would be an awesome song to remix with No Limit. Well, that was

1910
02:29:50,440 --> 02:29:52,200
the You Gotta Move It song.

1911
02:29:52,200 --> 02:29:53,200
Really? It was?

1912
02:29:53,200 --> 02:29:56,760
That it wasn't menu music. That was that new song. We are okay

1913
02:29:56,760 --> 02:29:59,600
We are gonna get to the v-ware actually very soon here very soon

1914
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:03,120
I do I don't want to go to a break just yet though

1915
02:30:03,120 --> 02:30:05,960
I want to like folks have a chance to submit in their cage match votes

1916
02:30:07,400 --> 02:30:11,360
Loki after the cage matches usually when we talk about what's going on in the sim scene a

1917
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:16,320
Lot of waiting is what's going on in the sim scene. We're waiting for a few things

1918
02:30:16,320 --> 02:30:19,120
We're waiting for my sale to come back up. We're waiting for

1919
02:30:19,120 --> 02:30:25,840
for Food makes 2 very least next week it's coming out Friday folks only a few

1920
02:30:25,840 --> 02:30:30,960
more days left on the 15th so keep an eye on orange on radio because we'll let

1921
02:30:30,960 --> 02:30:35,160
you know when it's up and what we think about it then we're also waiting to see

1922
02:30:35,160 --> 02:30:41,880
what's going on with was a DDR East Coast invasion because they're still

1923
02:30:41,880 --> 02:30:48,600
doing tournaments or tournaments six and I know they were up through bracket to

1924
02:30:48,600 --> 02:30:53,280
I got to play some of the songs and I have to say I'm glad they're they're done

1925
02:30:53,920 --> 02:30:57,500
Glad they're done doing these because it hasn't gotten any better at all

1926
02:30:58,200 --> 02:31:01,920
so now they're doing I guess attorney makes six wild card around and

1927
02:31:02,560 --> 02:31:08,060
What the hell that means? I don't know but it's gonna be done folks. So you're suffering will be over soon and

1928
02:31:09,320 --> 02:31:15,920
Yeah, that's pretty much it. We're just waiting lots of waiting but food mix tues coming soon. That's all you need to know

1929
02:31:15,920 --> 02:31:25,920
Tell the folks listening about that video game we were playing before the show tonight because that was an interesting little game.

1930
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:29,920
A lot of DDR fans are also Konami fans, so they might get a kick out of this one.

1931
02:31:29,920 --> 02:31:42,920
This was actually put out by Hudson Soft. This game, I'm assuming, came after Super Smash Brothers, but this is basically as close to Super Smash Brothers as you're going to get on the PlayStation 2.

1932
02:31:42,920 --> 02:31:50,800
2. It's an import only title and it's called Dream TV, like Dream Mix TV or something like

1933
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:58,800
that, World Fighters. And what it is, it's a collection of characters from Konami, from

1934
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:04,800
I want to say Hudson Soft and one other company. I can't remember the last company, but it

1935
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:10,120
is Super Smash Brothers with us. So, you get some really crazy match ups from Konami. For

1936
02:32:10,120 --> 02:32:15,400
For example, starting off they have Simon Belmont, they have, um, Solid Snake, that

1937
02:32:15,400 --> 02:32:21,320
was unlockable, Solid Snake, um, they have Twinbee, they have, um, this guy from Konami

1938
02:32:21,320 --> 02:32:27,480
Baseball or something like that, and then some other stuff, um, then they have, for,

1939
02:32:27,480 --> 02:32:35,360
was it Hudson, they had, um, I forget, Bomberman, they had, um, you know, just FYI, Jamie just

1940
02:32:35,360 --> 02:32:38,360
I just yelled that from the bathroom.

1941
02:32:38,360 --> 02:32:44,360
Okay, so they have Bomberman. They had like some Barbie type chick or something like that.

1942
02:32:44,360 --> 02:32:47,360
They had, I want to say...

1943
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:50,360
Optimus Prime, bitch! Optimus Prime, motherfucker!

1944
02:32:50,360 --> 02:32:51,360
Bomberman!

1945
02:32:51,360 --> 02:32:55,360
Bomberman was in it. Have you played this game? Dark Sakura? Have you played this game?

1946
02:32:55,360 --> 02:32:58,360
Goddamn, all I heard was Hudson's off and I think Bomberman.

1947
02:32:58,360 --> 02:33:04,360
A Super Smash Brothers ripoff, well, clone-ish game with Konami characters and Hudson characters and Optimus Prime.

1948
02:33:04,360 --> 02:33:05,360
Optimus Prime.

1949
02:33:05,360 --> 02:33:06,360
On what?

1950
02:33:06,360 --> 02:33:07,360
PlayStation 2.

1951
02:33:07,360 --> 02:33:08,360
PlayStation 2 Japanese.

1952
02:33:08,360 --> 02:33:09,360
Is it out?

1953
02:33:09,360 --> 02:33:10,360
When?

1954
02:33:10,360 --> 02:33:11,360
It's already out.

1955
02:33:11,360 --> 02:33:12,360
Ordering right now.

1956
02:33:12,360 --> 02:33:13,360
I have it on my PlayStation.

1957
02:33:13,360 --> 02:33:14,360
You gotta play it.

1958
02:33:14,360 --> 02:33:18,800
We did a matchup with Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime, who, by the way, turns into

1959
02:33:18,800 --> 02:33:19,800
a truck.

1960
02:33:19,800 --> 02:33:24,560
That was great, watching Optimus Prime turn into a truck and beat people, run people over.

1961
02:33:24,560 --> 02:33:28,100
They have characters from Bloody Roar in it.

1962
02:33:28,100 --> 02:33:29,960
They had one of the characters from that.

1963
02:33:29,960 --> 02:33:30,960
Adventure Island.

1964
02:33:30,960 --> 02:33:31,960
Adventure Island.

1965
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:32,960
This game is...

1966
02:33:32,960 --> 02:33:33,960
Master Higgins.

1967
02:33:33,960 --> 02:33:37,720
And this game's friggin' awesome! It just, it never came out over here, and...

1968
02:33:37,720 --> 02:33:39,000
It's not as good as Smash Brothers, that's why.

1969
02:33:39,000 --> 02:33:41,720
It's not as good as Smash Brothers, but it's still pretty damn fun.

1970
02:33:41,720 --> 02:33:43,080
I had fun playing it.

1971
02:33:43,080 --> 02:33:44,320
But it's very Japanese.

1972
02:33:44,320 --> 02:33:46,320
It's very Japanese.

1973
02:33:46,320 --> 02:33:49,200
So I think it's too much of a culture shock thing.

1974
02:33:49,200 --> 02:33:52,720
But it was really cool, and I hadn't... I was gonna...

1975
02:33:52,720 --> 02:33:58,200
The first time I played through it with Simon Belmont, and then I was gonna play it through it with Optimus Prime.

1976
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:03,960
and we have to do the show, but Optimus Prime was funny running in the people of the truck

1977
02:34:03,960 --> 02:34:06,600
yeah it was really funny they were playing this and I was sitting there

1978
02:34:06,600 --> 02:34:12,920
playing Burnout Legends and all of a sudden Rob goes, oh shoot, we've got to start the show in like three minutes

1979
02:34:12,920 --> 02:34:14,060
alright

1980
02:34:14,060 --> 02:34:15,840
and then it was, where's Jamie?

1981
02:34:15,840 --> 02:34:22,840
I'm sorry, I was in the bathroom, thank you. No, not now, before the show, and then I walked back here and then suddenly the front door opened

1982
02:34:22,840 --> 02:34:23,760
oh, speak

1983
02:34:23,760 --> 02:34:26,800
speak of the devil, literally

1984
02:34:26,800 --> 02:34:29,920
Alright, I was there too before I came here.

1985
02:34:29,920 --> 02:34:33,260
Alright, we're going to tally up those cage match votes right now and we're going to take

1986
02:34:33,260 --> 02:34:34,260
a break.

1987
02:34:34,260 --> 02:34:38,920
In this break, DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare music.

1988
02:34:38,920 --> 02:34:39,920
We got it.

1989
02:34:39,920 --> 02:34:40,920
Here it is.

1990
02:34:40,920 --> 02:34:46,960
We're going to hear in this break some of the shorter songs from, was that NCSX sold

1991
02:34:46,960 --> 02:34:47,960
out of Mario Mix?

1992
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:50,960
Yeah, DDR Mario Mix sold out on NCSX.

1993
02:34:50,960 --> 02:34:51,960
Alright.

1994
02:34:51,960 --> 02:34:52,960
Diet Channel.

1995
02:34:52,960 --> 02:34:54,680
Here we go.

1996
02:34:54,680 --> 02:34:57,640
to hear in this break because we picked some of the shorter songs because we're not going to be

1997
02:34:57,640 --> 02:35:02,280
able to play the whole thing you gotta move it which is the new song that's going to be playable

1998
02:35:02,280 --> 02:35:10,280

1999
02:35:10,280 --> 02:35:17,280

2000
02:36:10,280 --> 02:36:12,280
Yeah

2001
02:36:12,280 --> 02:36:14,280
Yeah

2002
02:36:14,280 --> 02:36:16,280
Yeah

2003
02:36:16,280 --> 02:36:18,280
Oh, yeah

2004
02:36:18,280 --> 02:36:20,280
Yeah, yeah

2005
02:36:20,280 --> 02:36:22,280
Yeah

2006
02:36:22,280 --> 02:36:24,280
Yeah

2007
02:36:24,280 --> 02:36:26,280
Oh, yeah

2008
02:36:26,280 --> 02:36:28,280
Oh, yeah

2009
02:36:28,280 --> 02:36:30,280
Yeah

2010
02:36:30,280 --> 02:36:32,280
You gotta know

2011
02:36:32,280 --> 02:36:52,280
Listen, take control of yourself, let your body take control

2012
02:37:02,280 --> 02:37:08,280
Falling, my whole world is falling

2013
02:37:08,280 --> 02:37:15,280
Without you in my life, so hard to keep from dying

2014
02:37:15,280 --> 02:37:19,280
When your eyes meet mine, everything seems fine

2015
02:37:19,280 --> 02:37:23,280
Always making love with you

2016
02:37:23,280 --> 02:37:26,280
Fear that you'll love me, always be with me

2017
02:37:26,280 --> 02:37:30,280
Forever and ever

2018
02:37:30,280 --> 02:37:38,280
But on that day when I awoke and I found I walk alone

2019
02:37:38,280 --> 02:37:43,280
I just feel deep down in my heart no more

2020
02:37:45,280 --> 02:37:51,280
You are my destiny, that's how it's supposed to be

2021
02:37:51,280 --> 02:37:56,280
That's the way it's really meant to be

2022
02:37:56,280 --> 02:38:00,280
I knew I'd defend to set you free

2023
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:12,280
I could keep on following you, never letting you go

2024
02:38:12,280 --> 02:38:16,280
Following you, losing all my fight

2025
02:38:16,280 --> 02:38:19,280
Going on you, never letting you go

2026
02:38:19,280 --> 02:38:22,280
Following you, but you'd run

2027
02:38:22,280 --> 02:38:32,280
You, you were my destiny I was planning for eternity

2028
02:38:32,280 --> 02:38:42,280
Something came and took away from me Baby, you, you were my destiny

2029
02:38:42,280 --> 02:38:48,280
You were the only man in this world for me, meant for me

2030
02:38:48,280 --> 02:38:52,780
But now you've run away, dear, to me

2031
02:40:48,280 --> 02:40:48,780
Ta-da!

2032
02:42:48,280 --> 02:43:03,160
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us, Orange Lounge

2033
02:43:03,160 --> 02:43:06,160
Radio.

2034
02:43:06,160 --> 02:43:12,640
Hello boys and girls, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, I almost want to call that Target

2035
02:43:12,640 --> 02:43:16,200
store back tomorrow morning and see if that copy got sold or somebody went and slapped

2036
02:43:16,200 --> 02:43:21,200
them on the wrist or what we'll see it's out there now anyway in that break some

2037
02:43:21,200 --> 02:43:26,160
music from the DDR extreme 2 v-rare you got to move it featuring Julie regard I

2038
02:43:26,160 --> 02:43:30,560
think it is destiny piano version I need you inside outdoor mix and infinite

2039
02:43:30,560 --> 02:43:34,560
prayer all from the new v-rare which by the way I tried to get at a GameStop

2040
02:43:34,560 --> 02:43:37,360
yesterday or I should really say Miklotov tried to get at a GameStop yesterday

2041
02:43:37,360 --> 02:43:40,440
which I don't really get cuz you know he kind of works for Konami and he doesn't

2042
02:43:40,440 --> 02:43:44,040
have a copy of the v-rare yet but we were trying to I get one from GameStop

2043
02:43:44,040 --> 02:43:49,120
and couldn't get one. Um, this is the weird thing though. Behind the counter. If I haven't

2044
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:52,740
gotten one yet. No, this is the weird thing. They said they had given some out, but they

2045
02:43:52,740 --> 02:43:57,660
thought they had one left. They had the cover and no disc in it. Like somebody had taken

2046
02:43:57,660 --> 02:44:01,380
the disc without the cover. They have them at the one that I know that's over on Madison

2047
02:44:01,380 --> 02:44:05,880
and Hazel over there. Really? They had a stack of them when I went there. Folks in chat room

2048
02:44:05,880 --> 02:44:09,880
are saying they're getting it now, so. I thought you had to pre-order it though to get one.

2049
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:12,880
Well, not if you know the right people.

2050
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:17,880
Anyway, so there was some tracks in there for you guys who didn't pre-order the game

2051
02:44:17,880 --> 02:44:21,880
or just wanted to hear it, haven't gotten your vrares yet.

2052
02:44:21,880 --> 02:44:25,880
Those were some of the tracks. Other tracks, some repeats from previous games

2053
02:44:25,880 --> 02:44:27,880
you've probably already heard before on the station.

2054
02:44:27,880 --> 02:44:30,880
Some other long version mixes, but we just don't have time to play those

2055
02:44:30,880 --> 02:44:33,880
because they're like seven or eight minutes, so maybe later on.

2056
02:44:33,880 --> 02:44:38,880
We can play the Seduction vocal mix, it's only 4.40.

2057
02:44:38,880 --> 02:44:55,880
Eh, maybe we'll get to that if we have time, but we're running a little late in show, actually, because usually we get to the FUs of the week around 8.30, and frickin' now it's 9.15, and we still haven't gotten to the FUs of the week, so I think we better do that, or we're gonna be in trouble.

2058
02:44:55,880 --> 02:44:58,880
Right, DarkSakurai? Because this is your little baby, after all.

2059
02:44:58,880 --> 02:45:03,880
So why is it, then, that we have to do the FUs of the week every single freaking week, like it or not?

2060
02:45:03,880 --> 02:45:20,880
My first FU of the week goes toward sleeping for 12 hours and waking up sick.

2061
02:45:20,880 --> 02:45:25,480
Also another FU goes to battle tech because it makes me motion sick.

2062
02:45:25,480 --> 02:45:30,560
Another FU goes toward...

2063
02:45:30,560 --> 02:45:34,300
I actually have something I can't say on the air, so just a generic F.U. towards something

2064
02:45:34,300 --> 02:45:40,700
that's stuck in my head. And, um, another one goes toward being sick again, and having

2065
02:45:40,700 --> 02:45:44,220
to go to work. That's it.

2066
02:45:44,220 --> 02:45:45,420
Alright, Loki's turn.

2067
02:45:45,420 --> 02:45:46,420
Oh yeah, one more.

2068
02:45:46,420 --> 02:45:47,420
Oh.

2069
02:45:47,420 --> 02:45:49,780
F.U. to world geography. Thank you.

2070
02:45:49,780 --> 02:45:56,300
Alright, let's go to Loki. I have one that's stuck in my mind, and that's basically, fuck

2071
02:45:56,300 --> 02:46:08,300
Thank you to the firewall that's at my work, because now I can't view a lot of sites because they're, you know, under different, like, logs, you know, like, spam or chat or whatever.

2072
02:46:08,300 --> 02:46:12,300
At one point we had, like, almost the whole internet blocked because they were messing with the filters.

2073
02:46:12,300 --> 02:46:13,300
Do you guys use Websense?

2074
02:46:13,300 --> 02:46:19,300
No, they have this Barracuda, uh, spy blocker thing, or Barracuda firewall or something.

2075
02:46:19,300 --> 02:46:25,300
That sucker, you know, it doesn't like proxy servers either, I tried getting around it that way, but, uh, no luck.

2076
02:46:25,300 --> 02:46:31,300
Anyways, um, yeah, but fuck that, because now I can't read stuff on LiveJournal and it cuts down one more page I can read.

2077
02:46:31,300 --> 02:46:34,300
Welcome to the world where the rest of us have to live and at work.

2078
02:46:34,300 --> 02:46:36,300
That's okay, I have my ways around things.

2079
02:46:36,300 --> 02:46:44,300
Um, anyways, so, that sucks, but, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else that I'm mad at, other than just not having enough time.

2080
02:46:44,300 --> 02:46:50,300
We need, like, 28-hour days or something, so I have more time to get stuff done.

2081
02:46:50,300 --> 02:46:54,300
And, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.

2082
02:46:54,300 --> 02:47:07,300
I'm going to give an F.U. to Vacation being over, because I want it to end.

2083
02:47:07,300 --> 02:47:12,300
So an F.U. to the fact that Vacation is running out and I actually have to go back to work tomorrow, that sucks.

2084
02:47:12,300 --> 02:47:17,300
And an F.U. to GameStop that didn't have the copy of the beer area in yesterday, because I wanted that.

2085
02:47:17,300 --> 02:47:23,300
FU to the fact that the systems that Dave & Busters went down for a little while yesterday, which took away from my precious playtime.

2086
02:47:23,300 --> 02:47:30,300
FU to the fact that I can't stop eating Cold Stone, because that ice cream is delicious, and it makes me fat.

2087
02:47:30,300 --> 02:47:36,300
And an FU to that guy in Final Fantasy XI who called me a cheap white mage because I don't have a race.

2088
02:47:36,300 --> 02:47:41,300
Fuck you, I've tried to do BCNM 40 I don't know how many times, I can't get that damn scroll. I can't win it for my life.

2089
02:47:41,300 --> 02:47:44,300
So, F.U. I hate you. No cures for you.

2090
02:47:45,300 --> 02:47:48,300
I like being a white mage because if I don't like somebody I'll let them die.

2091
02:47:49,300 --> 02:47:51,300
Oops, I'm sorry lag.

2092
02:47:52,300 --> 02:47:55,300
Let's go to Bugz with any F.Us he might have.

2093
02:47:56,300 --> 02:47:58,300
F.U. to your Comcast DVR.

2094
02:47:59,300 --> 02:48:00,300
Why?

2095
02:48:00,300 --> 02:48:02,300
It doesn't work like a TiVo.

2096
02:48:02,300 --> 02:48:04,300
I told you it's not as good as TiVo.

2097
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:05,300
Good God.

2098
02:48:05,300 --> 02:48:09,780
I thought you meant it didn't record suggestions. I didn't know it wouldn't go back

2099
02:48:11,080 --> 02:48:14,820
Well, and also since I haven't been on the show in a while if you do breaking my collarbone

2100
02:48:17,180 --> 02:48:19,180
Glad to see you up and about

2101
02:48:19,220 --> 02:48:19,860
Yes

2102
02:48:19,860 --> 02:48:25,080
Rob saw me when a couple of days afterward at a party and I pretty much sat in the chair and

2103
02:48:25,380 --> 02:48:27,820
vegged out drank a lot of beer and

2104
02:48:29,060 --> 02:48:33,460
We all laughed at pictures of ourselves from junior high in high school. No, mostly just mine

2105
02:48:33,460 --> 02:48:38,460
And Brian's, but that's because he wasn't there.

2106
02:48:38,460 --> 02:48:40,460
Let's see, uh...

2107
02:48:40,460 --> 02:48:43,460
Oh, FQ did the ER, but...

2108
02:48:43,460 --> 02:48:45,460
Because when I broke my collarbone, I had to go to ER.

2109
02:48:45,460 --> 02:48:49,460
I'm unemployed, I do not have insurance, and it was actually a lot less than I thought it would be,

2110
02:48:49,460 --> 02:48:52,460
but the fact that I didn't have insurance sucked.

2111
02:48:52,460 --> 02:48:56,460
Next time I fall and break my collarbone, I'm going to try and do it in Canada.

2112
02:48:56,460 --> 02:48:57,460
Yep.

2113
02:48:57,460 --> 02:48:59,460
Yeah, I'm going to plan on that.

2114
02:48:59,460 --> 02:49:02,460
Put it on the itinerary for next time I go for Vancouver.

2115
02:49:02,460 --> 02:49:05,460
Follow the off-bike brake collarbone.

2116
02:49:05,460 --> 02:49:07,460
Uh...

2117
02:49:07,460 --> 02:49:09,460
Not many other FUs.

2118
02:49:09,460 --> 02:49:11,460
Alright.

2119
02:49:11,460 --> 02:49:15,460
Wow, that music was too happy for an FU. I'm sorry.

2120
02:49:15,460 --> 02:49:17,460
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

2121
02:49:17,460 --> 02:49:19,460
Chat room FU time.

2122
02:49:19,460 --> 02:49:25,460
Sakarina says FU to rain to public transportation that isn't on time, trains and all that happening on the same day,

2123
02:49:25,460 --> 02:49:29,300
day, causing me to walk home from school in the rain, and staying stuck there due to a

2124
02:49:29,300 --> 02:49:38,300
train crossing. Tomokun would like to say fuck Live 365, fuck, fuck, fuck idiots.

2125
02:49:38,300 --> 02:49:42,700
Darkknight would like to say my F.U. goes to my Advance Wars DS game for being hard

2126
02:49:42,700 --> 02:49:46,780
as hell, and an F.U. to loneliness, no one in the world deserves to be all alone in the

2127
02:49:46,780 --> 02:49:51,560
world. SpiritSnare says F.U. to Tokyo Game Action

2128
02:49:51,560 --> 02:49:56,200
for getting Happy Sky, FU to certain Target stores for releasing We Heart Katamari earlier

2129
02:49:56,200 --> 02:50:03,640
than they're supposed to, FU to others for not, not Google but Goggle, says FU to Lowe's

2130
02:50:03,640 --> 02:50:08,480
Cineplex in Danbury, Connecticut for not letting me into an R-rated movie, also FU to schools

2131
02:50:08,480 --> 02:50:14,800
starting at 7.45 every morning, I think I've been to that theater in Connecticut, go figure,

2132
02:50:14,800 --> 02:50:19,520
I've been to a lot of really random places, Dark Tetsuya says the continued FU to this

2133
02:50:19,520 --> 02:50:24,040
crappy connection. And the F.U. to CCL's card system. No one explained that the cards expire,

2134
02:50:24,040 --> 02:50:29,560
so I had to find out the hard way. Yeah, I read that in your L.J. and I was pissed too.

2135
02:50:29,560 --> 02:50:36,560
Rene would like to say, I have an F.U. to diarrhea or indigestion. You know, in the

2136
02:50:36,640 --> 02:50:42,320
hundred and fifty-five episodes we've done of Orange Lounge Radio, you think that's something

2137
02:50:42,320 --> 02:50:48,600
someone would have said F.U. to a long time ago because, what? You didn't flat out say

2138
02:50:48,600 --> 02:50:54,640
say diarrhea. You did say indigestion, but... No, F you to the medication the doctor puts

2139
02:50:54,640 --> 02:51:01,640
you on. I have done an F you though to drinking a lot of Hawaiian Punch and coloring my feces

2140
02:51:02,880 --> 02:51:09,880
blue. So I think that kind of tops that one. If you eat asparagus it turns your pee a different

2141
02:51:10,320 --> 02:51:16,560
color too. If you have honey smacks it makes your pee smell like honey smacks, did you

2142
02:51:16,560 --> 02:51:18,560
That sounds incredibly nasty.

2143
02:51:18,560 --> 02:51:20,560
It's incredible.

2144
02:51:20,560 --> 02:51:22,560
First off, why are you sniffing your pee?

2145
02:51:22,560 --> 02:51:24,560
It doesn't...

2146
02:51:24,560 --> 02:51:26,560
That stuff is so strong.

2147
02:51:26,560 --> 02:51:28,560
It's the aroma that wafts up from the toilet.

2148
02:51:28,560 --> 02:51:30,560
Exactly. It's like, honey smacks.

2149
02:51:30,560 --> 02:51:32,560
Rubs red. Look, rubs red.

2150
02:51:32,560 --> 02:51:36,560
I just can't... I can't believe this show has literally gone into the toilet.

2151
02:51:36,560 --> 02:51:39,560
Hey, we can't make poo-poo jokes anymore, so...

2152
02:51:39,560 --> 02:51:45,560
So much to compile a website of all the different foods that will make your, like, you know, bile and...

2153
02:51:45,560 --> 02:51:48,260
Your one and two smell like something else I

2154
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:54,560
Can imagine some of our listeners are now gonna go really and like drink a whole gallon of blue

2155
02:51:54,560 --> 02:51:57,880
Why don't wine punch that she is awesome, but they don't sell it anymore

2156
02:51:58,080 --> 02:52:02,040
They don't sell the blue stuff. They sell green and like orange and stuff

2157
02:52:02,040 --> 02:52:08,440
So and red and I don't you know want drink a gallon of red. I like the blue stuff and they don't sell it

2158
02:52:08,440 --> 02:52:09,760
That sucks

2159
02:52:09,760 --> 02:52:10,760
Moving on.

2160
02:52:10,760 --> 02:52:15,760
F you to everybody because I have a Sega CDX and no one else.

2161
02:52:15,760 --> 02:52:17,760
Sega CDX?

2162
02:52:17,760 --> 02:52:18,760
Huh?

2163
02:52:18,760 --> 02:52:23,760
Rene is saying an F you to everybody because he has a CDX and nobody else does, but you

2164
02:52:23,760 --> 02:52:25,760
have one, don't you?

2165
02:52:25,760 --> 02:52:26,760
Yeah.

2166
02:52:26,760 --> 02:52:28,760
Actually, I have a regular CDX.

2167
02:52:28,760 --> 02:52:29,760
I have both.

2168
02:52:29,760 --> 02:52:30,760
I have all three, I think.

2169
02:52:30,760 --> 02:52:34,760
I'm sure you know what sort of context I mean in that last one.

2170
02:52:34,760 --> 02:52:41,720
Zakku would like to say F you to being unemployed for nearly 9 months and F you to not getting

2171
02:52:41,720 --> 02:52:43,360
work study this year.

2172
02:52:43,360 --> 02:52:47,800
F you to not having to wait this long to order my books for school.

2173
02:52:47,800 --> 02:52:52,100
F you to State University of New York University Police for giving us heat for having lots

2174
02:52:52,100 --> 02:52:58,920
of people in the front of our apartment on Friday and Saturday nights.

2175
02:52:58,920 --> 02:53:07,480
SIN or S1N. Fuck you to there not being any retarded Target stores in Canada.

2176
02:53:07,480 --> 02:53:10,720
Are there, is there a Target in Canada? I hope so, are you guys really missing out?

2177
02:53:10,720 --> 02:53:13,680
Okay, there is Target in Canada. And the Walmart doesn't have a star in the

2178
02:53:13,680 --> 02:53:16,080
middle, it has a dash. Who fucking cares?

2179
02:53:16,080 --> 02:53:17,320
I don't know. Alright.

2180
02:53:17,320 --> 02:53:21,720
Well, if you watch shows that are supposedly, like, in the US, and they're actually filmed

2181
02:53:21,720 --> 02:53:26,520
in Canada, you can tell. You got a lot of free time on your hands, don't

2182
02:53:26,520 --> 02:53:36,520
There's a Walmart, is it like a Walmart or Target commercial when it's showing what is out here known as best foods, mayonnaise, it shows actually Hellman's.

2183
02:53:36,520 --> 02:53:47,520
ColorOfSakura says, F you to silly high school drama that I keep getting pulled into because people think I care. Just remember, yeah, it gets better in college.

2184
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:49,520
There's lots of drinking involved, too.

2185
02:53:49,520 --> 02:53:55,520
Yep. Ron Cham says, F you to the con I'm staffing for. I'm in charge of two departments, and I got no help here. I need a drink.

2186
02:53:55,520 --> 02:54:11,520
John Field says, F you to my sudden loss of interest in Phantasy Star Online. Here I'm trying to pull out a machinima, and I'm finding I can't play the game normally anymore without feeling totally drained. Oh well, it was a good five year run.

2187
02:54:11,520 --> 02:54:13,320
5 year run.

2188
02:54:13,320 --> 02:54:16,800
I've owned that fucking game on like 4 different systems and I never want to play it again.

2189
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:17,800
Sorry.

2190
02:54:17,800 --> 02:54:19,360
I haven't played it since I got married.

2191
02:54:19,360 --> 02:54:23,840
BakaNiko says F you for not having any targets in the area so I cannot check one.

2192
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:25,600
I'm sorry, Weheart Katamari.

2193
02:54:25,600 --> 02:54:26,600
Uh, Bob.

2194
02:54:26,600 --> 02:54:27,600
Huh?

2195
02:54:27,600 --> 02:54:28,600
Neko means cat.

2196
02:54:28,600 --> 02:54:29,600
Sorry.

2197
02:54:29,600 --> 02:54:30,600
Blah.

2198
02:54:30,600 --> 02:54:34,960
GS191 says F you to the in the groove for breaking on me.

2199
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:38,160
F you to Comcast for the cable going out 3 times this week.

2200
02:54:38,160 --> 02:54:40,600
F you to leechers that are not seeding Advent Children.

2201
02:54:40,600 --> 02:54:44,800
F you to politics, Republicans suck and Democrats blow.

2202
02:54:44,800 --> 02:54:50,480
F you to G4 for trying to get tech back, it is too late, and may G4 go down in flames.

2203
02:54:50,480 --> 02:54:52,440
My dad's very happy that Leo Laporte is back on.

2204
02:54:52,440 --> 02:54:54,600
Yes, I am happy Leo Laporte's come back.

2205
02:54:54,600 --> 02:54:57,360
Leo, take him in from the inside, take him out.

2206
02:54:57,360 --> 02:55:00,960
You need to tell him about that live taping of This Week in Tech that's going on in NorCal.

2207
02:55:00,960 --> 02:55:05,320
Yes, there's going to be, there's two podcasts I'll listen to, this one and This Week in

2208
02:55:05,320 --> 02:55:06,320
Tech.

2209
02:55:06,320 --> 02:55:07,840
Technically this right now is not a podcast.

2210
02:55:07,840 --> 02:55:08,840
I know.

2211
02:55:08,840 --> 02:55:09,840
Podcast will be later.

2212
02:55:09,840 --> 02:55:11,840
I know, I know what you mean.

2213
02:55:18,840 --> 02:55:19,840
Where the hell's that?

2214
02:55:19,840 --> 02:55:20,840
North Bay, right?

2215
02:55:20,840 --> 02:55:22,840
Yeah, it's North Bay. It's north of San Francisco.

2216
02:55:22,840 --> 02:55:24,840
I want to go there and just whore out Orange Lounge.

2217
02:55:24,840 --> 02:55:27,840
That's what pretty much my plan was.

2218
02:55:27,840 --> 02:55:28,840
Alright, sounds good.

2219
02:55:28,840 --> 02:55:30,840
jadedangel, we got a couple more here.

2220
02:55:30,840 --> 02:55:31,840
jadedangel says,

2221
02:55:31,840 --> 02:55:35,840
F you to Sony for making the release date of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children be delayed.

2222
02:55:35,840 --> 02:55:37,840
Well, go download it.

2223
02:55:37,840 --> 02:55:38,840
Not that we advocate that.

2224
02:55:38,840 --> 02:55:44,840
Get usenet, folks. No need for seeds on that. It downloads about a hundred times faster.

2225
02:55:44,840 --> 02:55:50,840
Darkknight says, oh, and a final F.U. to Accounting Homework for causing me total brain damage.

2226
02:55:50,840 --> 02:55:55,840
End of line. Oh wait, no, was there one more here?

2227
02:55:55,840 --> 02:56:01,840
Oh, alright, that's it. That's it. That was all the F.Us of the week.

2228
02:56:01,840 --> 02:56:04,840
F.U. to Christopher for not bringing anything for us.

2229
02:56:04,840 --> 02:56:06,840
No, I'm hungry, lookin' at that, ugh.

2230
02:56:06,840 --> 02:56:08,840
That's alright.

2231
02:56:08,840 --> 02:56:09,840
Hi.

2232
02:56:09,840 --> 02:56:10,840
Hello.

2233
02:56:10,840 --> 02:56:11,840
We have four minutes left to show.

2234
02:56:11,840 --> 02:56:14,840
Do you want to give us a quick movie review of what you saw this week?

2235
02:56:14,840 --> 02:56:18,840
Sure, I saw Serenity, which was really, really, really well done.

2236
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:20,840
I recommend it to everybody.

2237
02:56:20,840 --> 02:56:23,840
FYI, he's a little bit biased because he's a Buffy whore.

2238
02:56:23,840 --> 02:56:25,840
That's okay.

2239
02:56:25,840 --> 02:56:28,840
Dark Soccer, I believe, agrees with me, right?

2240
02:56:28,840 --> 02:56:30,840
I wanted to go, and I couldn't, because that's cool.

2241
02:56:30,840 --> 02:56:32,840
I have something for you, it's a bunch of the nuts.

2242
02:56:32,840 --> 02:56:48,840
I found out the other day, cause this was last week after we did our fake show thing, Christopher was showing us the funny part in that one gay porn.

2243
02:56:48,840 --> 02:56:56,840
And that reminded me of the trailer that was on one of them for The Hole, I guess cause it's a gay porn version of The Ring.

2244
02:56:56,840 --> 02:57:01,040
That's why our company is actually distributing that.

2245
02:57:01,040 --> 02:57:03,040
Which is hilarious.

2246
02:57:03,040 --> 02:57:05,040
Yes.

2247
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:11,080
You know how a lot of pornos will do funny play on the regular movie title?

2248
02:57:11,080 --> 02:57:12,920
I remember there was a porno once.

2249
02:57:12,920 --> 02:57:13,920
It was Ali McFeel.

2250
02:57:13,920 --> 02:57:14,920
Was it a porno?

2251
02:57:14,920 --> 02:57:15,920
Edward Penisands.

2252
02:57:15,920 --> 02:57:17,920
Yeah, Edward Penisands I've seen.

2253
02:57:17,920 --> 02:57:20,960
I saw the first one I ever saw was the Boneheads.

2254
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:23,600
Beaver and Buttface is another one I've seen.

2255
02:57:23,600 --> 02:57:26,560
Before you're gay, you see the hole.

2256
02:57:26,560 --> 02:57:29,640
Now they're doing The Ring, except it's the gay version.

2257
02:57:29,640 --> 02:57:31,440
It's totally hot, too.

2258
02:57:31,440 --> 02:57:33,440
I recommend that movie, too.

2259
02:57:33,440 --> 02:57:37,440
Oh, and I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose, which was okay.

2260
02:57:37,440 --> 02:57:39,280
It was okay?

2261
02:57:39,280 --> 02:57:40,280
Yeah.

2262
02:57:40,280 --> 02:57:41,280
But Serenity was great.

2263
02:57:41,280 --> 02:57:42,280
I recommend that.

2264
02:57:42,280 --> 02:57:43,280
Two thumbs up.

2265
02:57:43,280 --> 02:57:44,880
Two thumbs up and...

2266
02:57:44,880 --> 02:57:47,400
You need to come up with a gay rating system to rate movies.

2267
02:57:47,400 --> 02:57:50,080
Two cocks up.

2268
02:57:50,080 --> 02:57:51,880
I give it two hard dicks up.

2269
02:57:51,880 --> 02:57:52,880
Okay.

2270
02:57:52,880 --> 02:57:53,880
Here's Loki.

2271
02:57:53,880 --> 02:57:55,060
No, no, no.

2272
02:57:55,060 --> 02:58:07,060
two hard dicks up my ass okay yeah well I didn't see it going in that direction

2273
02:58:07,060 --> 02:58:12,740

2274
02:58:12,740 --> 02:58:19,900

2275
02:58:19,900 --> 02:58:22,780
got we have a couple minutes left here what do you say what do I want to say I

2276
02:58:22,780 --> 02:58:30,460
I want to say that I was reading the other day, so I like to read digs sometimes, and

2277
02:58:30,460 --> 02:58:35,460
there was some funny stuff I was reading on there. I don't know.

2278
02:58:35,460 --> 02:58:41,280
You need to dig our target thing. Yeah. Screw that. I'm, I'm, I am bitching

2279
02:58:41,280 --> 02:58:45,700
to Amco, but what the hell? You can't get us our shit on time, but you can sure as hell

2280
02:58:45,700 --> 02:58:49,180
give it a target? It doesn't know what the hell to do with it? Morons?

2281
02:58:49,180 --> 02:58:52,300
You know, I don't know what's up with that.

2282
02:58:52,300 --> 02:58:57,020
The fact is, what's up with that? I want to know why they aren't sending me free samples.

2283
02:58:57,020 --> 02:58:58,100
That's what I want to know.

2284
02:58:58,100 --> 02:59:02,140
But why aren't you sending me this shit for free? I should be having it already.

2285
02:59:02,140 --> 02:59:06,220
Namco Battle Collection, my ass. You know what?

2286
02:59:06,220 --> 02:59:09,700
I just can't wait for Burnout Revenge. It's coming out next week.

2287
02:59:09,700 --> 02:59:16,140
I love that game. I had to get Burnout Legends to tie me over. It's kind of a

2288
02:59:16,140 --> 02:59:18,660
transitional into Burnout Revenge.

2289
02:59:18,660 --> 02:59:25,660
I'm gonna be playing that for months. Alright, until Liberty Sea Stories comes out.

2290
02:59:25,660 --> 02:59:30,660
Huh? Oh, did we do the Cage Match winners? I don't think we did the Cage Match winners.

2291
02:59:30,660 --> 02:59:33,660
Oh, fucking A. Who did win the Cage Match winners? There's the vote tally.

2292
02:59:33,660 --> 02:59:39,660
Tonight's Cage Match winner was... It was actually very close. All three songs got a lot of votes tonight,

2293
02:59:39,660 --> 02:59:42,660
so everybody should feel really good. But this one won.

2294
02:59:42,660 --> 02:59:50,660
Good, cool. Future and Jeff Koop. Yeah, I'm going to find a song for next week. Woohoo!

2295

Alright, congratulations there. That was a very close one.

2296
02:59:55,660 --> 02:59:59,660

Dark Sakura.

2322
03:01:08,960 --> 03:01:11,800
I've been married for ten days.

2323
03:01:11,800 --> 03:01:13,520
Reject both icons.

2324
03:01:13,520 --> 03:01:16,240
You're still a newlywed. You should have a reality TV show.

2325
03:01:16,240 --> 03:01:18,040
Hell no!

2326
03:01:18,040 --> 03:01:22,440

2335
03:02:20,320 --> 03:02:24,320
Riding a bloke with her tiara on

2336
03:02:24,320 --> 03:02:29,320
Holding this humongous bouquet in her hand

2337
03:02:29,320 --> 03:02:34,320
She looked great out of Disneyland

2338
03:02:34,320 --> 03:02:38,320
You know what's a Cinderella ride? I mean definitely an E ticket

2339
03:02:38,320 --> 03:02:44,320
Crowd was cheering, everyone was stoked

2340
03:02:44,320 --> 03:02:48,320
I mean it was like the whole school was totally coked or something

2341
03:02:48,320 --> 03:02:53,320
The band was playing, everything

2342
03:02:53,320 --> 03:02:58,320
And all of a sudden, somebody screamed

2343
03:02:58,320 --> 03:03:01,320
Look out! The Homecoming Queen's got a gun!

2344
03:03:03,320 --> 03:03:05,320
Everybody runs

2345
03:03:05,320 --> 03:03:08,320
The Homecoming Queen's got a gun

2346
03:03:08,320 --> 03:03:11,320
Everybody runs

2347
03:03:11,320 --> 03:03:15,320
The homecoming queen has got a gun

2348
03:03:20,320 --> 03:03:23,320
Debbie smiling and waving her gun

2349
03:03:23,320 --> 03:03:25,820
Picking up cheerleaders one by one

2350
03:03:25,820 --> 03:03:28,820
Oh, Buffy's pom-pom just blew to bits

2351
03:03:28,820 --> 03:03:31,820
Oh no, Miffy's head just did the splits

2352
03:03:31,820 --> 03:03:34,820
God, my best friend's on a shooting spree

2353
03:03:34,820 --> 03:03:37,820
Stop it, Debbie, you're embarrassing me

2354
03:03:37,820 --> 03:03:40,820
How could you do what you just did?

2355
03:03:40,820 --> 03:03:42,820
Are you having a really bad period?

2356
03:03:43,820 --> 03:03:45,820
Everybody run

2357
03:03:45,820 --> 03:03:48,820
The homecoming queen's got a gun

2358
03:03:49,820 --> 03:03:51,820
Everybody run

2359
03:03:51,820 --> 03:03:55,820
The homecoming queen has got a gun

2360
03:03:55,820 --> 03:03:57,820
The king's been hit in the neck

2361
03:03:57,820 --> 03:04:00,820
And the burner's been blown to death

2362
03:04:00,820 --> 03:04:03,820
An hour later, the cops arrived

2363
03:04:03,820 --> 03:04:05,820
But then the entire glee club had died

2364
03:04:05,820 --> 03:04:06,820
No big loss

2365
03:04:06,820 --> 03:04:08,820
You wouldn't believe what they brought the staffer

2366
03:04:08,820 --> 03:04:11,820
Here we have machine guns, even a chopper!

2367
03:04:11,820 --> 03:04:14,820
Throw down your gun in the yard and come out of the club!

2368
03:04:14,820 --> 03:04:17,820
She said she didn't listen to what the cops said

2369
03:04:17,820 --> 03:04:21,820
She aimed and fired and now the math teacher said I was really sad

2370
03:04:21,820 --> 03:04:25,820
But kind of a relief, I mean, we had this big catch coming up next week

2371
03:04:25,820 --> 03:04:28,820
Everybody runs

2372
03:04:28,820 --> 03:04:31,820
The homecoming queen's got a gun

2373
03:04:31,820 --> 03:04:34,820
Everybody runs

2374
03:04:34,820 --> 03:04:37,820
The homecoming queen has got a gun

2375
03:04:37,820 --> 03:04:39,420
She had got a gun

2376
03:04:39,420 --> 03:04:41,420
She had a knife

2377
03:04:41,420 --> 03:04:44,420
She went deep, happened to laugh

2378
03:04:44,420 --> 03:04:47,420
The cops fired a warning shot that blew her off the float

2379
03:04:47,420 --> 03:04:50,420
I tried to stream stuff, but it stuck in my throat

2380
03:04:50,420 --> 03:04:53,420
She hit the ground and did a flip, it was real acrobatic

2381
03:04:53,420 --> 03:04:56,420
But I was crying so hard, I couldn't work my eustematic

2382
03:04:56,420 --> 03:04:58,420
I ran down to Debbie, I had to find out

2383
03:04:58,420 --> 03:05:00,420
What made her do it?

2384
03:05:00,420 --> 03:05:02,420
Why'd she pick out?

2385
03:05:02,420 --> 03:05:04,420
I said the bullet had got her right in the ear

2386
03:05:04,420 --> 03:05:09,420
I knew then the end was near.

2387
03:05:09,420 --> 03:05:13,420
So I ran down and I said, in her good ear,

2388
03:05:13,420 --> 03:05:15,420
Debbie, why did you do it?

2389
03:05:15,420 --> 03:05:18,420
She raised her head, smiled, and said,

2390
03:05:18,420 --> 03:05:23,420
I did it for Johnny.

2391
03:05:23,420 --> 03:05:26,420
Johnny? Well, like, who's Johnny?

2392
03:05:26,420 --> 03:05:28,420
Answer me, Debbie. Who's Johnny?

2393
03:05:28,420 --> 03:05:30,420
Does anybody here know Johnny? Are you Johnny?

2394
03:05:30,420 --> 03:05:32,420
There was one guy named Johnny, but he was a total geek

2395
03:05:32,420 --> 03:05:34,420
He's a total geek and we've had food in his braces

2396
03:05:34,420 --> 03:05:36,420
And to be Debbie, who's Johnny?

2397
03:05:36,420 --> 03:05:41,420
Oh God, it's like that movie Citizen Kane, you know, where you later find out Rosebud was his lad

2398
03:05:41,420 --> 03:05:44,420
But we'll never know who Johnny was since, like, she's dead

2399
03:05:55,420 --> 03:05:58,420
Everybody runs

2400
03:05:58,420 --> 03:06:01,420
The homecoming queen's got a gun

2401
03:06:01,420 --> 03:06:07,420
Everybody run, the whole country queen has got us.

2402
03:06:07,420 --> 03:06:09,420
Everybody run.
