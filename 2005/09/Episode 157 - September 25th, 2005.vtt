02:32.680 --> 02:35.680
That's a highly sore point with me.

02:35.680 --> 02:38.680
No one in my work wanted it, so I got it by default.

02:38.680 --> 02:43.680
Wow. Okay, well, we'll get to all things Bomani and all things gaming.

02:43.680 --> 02:45.680

He just lied.

05:38.860 --> 05:39.860
I totally just lied.

05:39.860 --> 05:40.860
He totally just lied.

05:40.860 --> 05:41.860
She's not a bunny.

05:41.860 --> 05:45.860
She's a giggling schoolgirl. We established that on the last podcast.

05:45.860 --> 05:48.860
Oh, I got the glare. I got the glare, kids.

05:48.860 --> 05:49.860
I don't find that funny at all.

05:49.860 --> 05:50.860
Sorry.

05:50.860 --> 05:52.860
Because I don't appreciate sexism.

05:52.860 --> 05:54.860
I'm only talking about that later on.

05:54.860 --> 05:57.860
Um, actually, okay.

05:57.860 --> 05:58.860
All right.

05:58.860 --> 05:59.860
Gave him another day.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.860
Good. Good to hear.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.860
It probably pissed me off.

06:01.860 --> 06:07.860
All right, I'll be talking about reasons for that throughout tonight's show.

06:07.860 --> 06:10.860
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

06:10.860 --> 06:16.620

06:16.620 --> 06:17.620
have.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.620
Um.

06:18.620 --> 06:19.620
What?

06:19.620 --> 06:22.100
Sexism, sex, you name it.

Oh, I get it.

16:36.880 --> 16:38.160
Why would I play an In the Groove song?

16:38.160 --> 16:42.160
Because we're going to be doing an In the Groove game giveaway.

16:42.160 --> 16:45.640
I don't know if we're doing that tonight, we have to think of the rules for how we want

16:45.640 --> 16:51.400
the giveaway to work, so we're going to talk about that, however this copy of In the Groove

16:51.400 --> 16:55.600
has a special treat with it, it's not just any copy of In the Groove, it is an In the

16:55.600 --> 17:03.200
Groove copy signed by Loki, DarkSakura, and myself, with our own little sayings on it

17:03.200 --> 17:04.200
for you guys.

17:04.200 --> 17:06.800
Signed is such a wonderful word, I would say deface.

17:06.800 --> 17:12.240
whatever we're just gonna let us have our way with this game and then we're

17:12.240 --> 17:16.600
gonna give it away to some lucky listener and we don't know exactly how

17:16.600 --> 17:21.120
we're gonna do that yet but I do know that we're gonna also give a give away

17:21.120 --> 17:29.200
some v-rares we've got some v-rares for DDR max 2 and DDR EX 2 so of course the

17:29.200 --> 17:32.000
max 2 v-rares they're kind of hard to find now so if you didn't get it when

17:32.000 --> 17:34.880
the games out this is the only way you're really gonna you know maybe get

17:34.880 --> 17:39.140
one unless you can find them so what we're gonna do we're gonna give away I

17:39.140 --> 17:43.540
guess we'll give away in Paris we'll give away at EX 2 and max 2 CD together

17:43.540 --> 17:47.980
and all you got to do we'll give away one tonight live on the show and then

we'll give away one through our podcast sound good all right cool so what you're

17:52.420 --> 17:54.820
gonna do you want to get in now because like you know there's thousands of

17:54.820 --> 17:58.580
people that listen to the podcast but there's probably only about 12 that

17:58.580 --> 18:01.620
listen to this program no I'm kidding it's more than that but it's

18:01.620 --> 18:05.460
significantly less to listen to this program. So get your name in now if you want to win

18:05.460 --> 18:09.340
one of these. All you have to do, it's easy, you don't even have to think about it, just

18:09.340 --> 18:18.200
send an email to freestuff at orangelaungeradio.com. Free stuff, all one word, freestuff at orangelaungeradio.com.

18:18.200 --> 18:22.840
One entry per person, if you enter twice, I'm going to beat you up.

18:22.840 --> 18:28.720
I said entering twice is a disqualification. That's right, if you enter twice, we'll ban

18:28.720 --> 18:32.720
Just like you were a Ragnarok player. We will ban you. No, I'm kidding.

18:32.720 --> 18:36.720
We will just ban you. So, just one entry per person, please.

18:36.720 --> 18:40.720
And we're going to give that away. Now, if you enter right now, you'll also be entered

18:40.720 --> 18:44.720
for the one we're going to do on the podcast anyway, because I'm going to check from the same email account.

18:44.720 --> 18:48.720
So, get in now before the night is over. So, you

18:48.720 --> 18:52.720
got a couple hours there. Alright. Do those of us currently here qualify?

18:52.720 --> 18:56.720
No. Fuck you. Because some of us in the room already have them.

18:56.720 --> 19:00.560
some of us can get them other ways wink wink nudge nudge but these are

19:00.560 --> 19:05.360
authentic copies of EX2 no you cannot just send me a message because I'm

19:05.360 --> 19:08.720
overwhelmed with private messages as it is we want to collect this plus there's

19:08.720 --> 19:12.920
some people that are just shy and don't want to join the chat room so we can let

19:12.920 --> 19:17.400
them send an email all you have to do free stuff at orange lounge radio.com

19:17.400 --> 19:22.000
and again this is not for the in the group giveaway this is for the extreme

19:22.000 --> 19:28.480
Game 2 slash Max 2 v-rares. Super. And by the way, if you win, you have to answer a

19:28.480 --> 19:33.440
reply back with your address, because we have to know where to mail this stuff, so. Alright,

19:33.440 --> 19:37.800
get on that kid, send an email, we'll announce a winner later on in the program. For now,

19:37.800 --> 19:40.480
let's play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, let's go around and see

19:40.480 --> 19:45.560
how people's week was and their day, because after all, this show isn't just about games,

19:45.560 --> 19:49.560
It's about us and our egos. DarkSakura.

19:49.560 --> 19:53.560
That week was just, eh, regular stuff.

19:53.560 --> 19:57.560
Um, I played a few games.

19:57.560 --> 20:01.560
Hung out. I mean, Dan was gone most of the week at the GameStop

20:01.560 --> 20:05.560
uh, uh, manager conference in Texas.

20:05.560 --> 20:09.560
So um, I sat around by myself a lot, um, except for

20:09.560 --> 20:13.560
going to a party, going to the club,

20:13.560 --> 20:17.960
Playing with my Nintendogs, playing some Beatmania, playing World of Warcraft.

20:19.560 --> 20:25.120
Really, that's about it. Oh, yeah, and I played on the main for a little bit, a bit more, uh, Puyo Puyo, arcade version, and

20:26.440 --> 20:29.960
Blazing Star and Pulsar, or Pulsar, I'm sorry, and

20:30.720 --> 20:37.160
Metal Slug 5 and a bunch of crap just because I was really bored hanging out in the garage doing laundry.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.120
And

20:42.120 --> 20:47.720
That's really how my week went. You know, Dan came home today, which was good, and then

20:47.720 --> 20:53.080
he promptly left to go play Madden at the neighbor's house, which he said, oh, I told

20:53.080 --> 20:56.400
you. I was like, well, you didn't tell me where I could actually hear you when you were

20:56.400 --> 21:00.040
in the same room with me. So I didn't know. He just disappeared. So I got involved in

21:00.040 --> 21:05.140
a project, and he came like, oh, you want to play Madden with me? That game sucks, and

21:05.140 --> 21:09.960
American football sucks. Why would I want to do something that doubly sucks? That's

21:09.960 --> 21:16.180
okay I'm doing something that doesn't suck so now why you said in the intro

21:16.180 --> 21:19.900
you were a little bitter over we heart katamari what's up because how can you

21:19.900 --> 21:25.260
be bitter a game came out of GameStop he was on the plane I couldn't buy my game

21:25.260 --> 21:29.160
because I don't see I can wait a little bit to get something in the 30% discount

21:29.160 --> 21:36.480
I don't see paying full price when I don't have to I am a frugal gamer so you

21:36.480 --> 21:40.880
you know, buying my game, my U.S. game, so the discount means I can import my games later.

21:40.880 --> 21:45.120
Gotcha, so you just have to wait a little bit until the man can, you know, pull the

21:45.120 --> 21:46.720
strings. Actually go to work and pick it up, so I'm

21:46.720 --> 21:49.800
not going to have it until Tuesday. Which I really don't care, since I've already

21:49.800 --> 21:53.400
played the crap out of it in other ways. I know, that's not that bad news. I thought

21:53.400 --> 21:57.200
for some reason, like, you know, I don't know, like, Weheart Katamari, like, slept with your

21:57.200 --> 22:01.560
friends and ate your puppies. But I get sick of everybody talking about

22:01.560 --> 22:04.200
it to me as though I've played it. Oh.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.200
You did?

22:05.200 --> 22:10.260
Well, yeah, I've played the Japanese one, but they talk about it as though I have it

22:10.260 --> 22:13.600
now and I don't have it yet and act like it's, you know, the end of the world.

22:13.600 --> 22:15.600
I'm like, fuck you!

22:15.600 --> 22:17.140
I didn't get it the day it came out.

22:17.140 --> 22:18.140
I got it yesterday.

22:18.140 --> 22:24.360
So I don't really care to hear anything about, like, on top of that, with all the hype that's

22:24.360 --> 22:28.640
been going on, I've hit my saturation point of Katamari.

22:28.640 --> 22:30.000
I'll tell you, it is really good, though.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.120
I wasn't disappointed.

22:32.120 --> 22:33.920
I think they have a change of heart.

22:33.920 --> 22:35.320
I think you'll have a change of heart.

22:35.320 --> 22:35.820
I do.

22:35.820 --> 22:36.320
I do.

22:36.320 --> 22:40.320
Honestly, I really don't care when I get it.

22:40.320 --> 22:44.320
As soon as I can go 24 hours without seeing or hearing

22:44.320 --> 22:48.320
the word katamari, I will play it.

22:48.320 --> 22:50.600
And no, I'm not joking, because I have not

22:50.600 --> 22:53.360
been able to go that long without either hearing it

22:53.360 --> 22:54.320
or seeing it.

22:54.320 --> 22:58.080
So when I can go 24 hours without hearing or seeing

22:58.080 --> 23:01.040
the word katamari, I will play it.

23:01.040 --> 23:01.640
All right.

23:01.640 --> 23:03.800
That could be a while.

23:03.800 --> 23:10.120
It's today's secret word! When you hear today's secret word, scream real loud, huh?

23:10.120 --> 23:11.700
Today's secret word is...

23:11.700 --> 23:13.520
AKAMARI!

23:13.520 --> 23:18.360
So when you hear today's secret word, scream real loud!

23:18.360 --> 23:20.560
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

23:20.560 --> 23:24.120
I can't start off like I was going to, but okay.

23:24.120 --> 23:26.940
My week is good. We actually got a lot of the wedding stuff done,

23:26.940 --> 23:28.420
locations done,

23:28.420 --> 23:30.080
uh... she has her

23:30.080 --> 23:31.680
dress you being ordered

23:31.680 --> 23:32.920
at all done

23:32.920 --> 23:34.960
just britain

23:34.960 --> 23:37.020
thank god

23:37.020 --> 23:38.400
as of the way

23:38.400 --> 23:40.960
the winging now uh...

23:40.960 --> 23:43.120
now but actually uh...

23:43.120 --> 23:46.120
i meant to play more games this week at the level of bernard revenge

23:46.120 --> 23:47.200
per usual

23:47.200 --> 23:52.440
and the one my one great book bernard revenge is their random track selection

23:52.440 --> 23:54.380
it quite random in fact

23:54.380 --> 23:58.000
i get the same track every time i do random so

23:58.000 --> 24:03.520
I'm kind of wondering why, you know, it's so faulty, but it's still a fun track.

24:03.520 --> 24:05.400
And then, uh...

24:05.400 --> 24:10.400
Let's see, what else? Oh, I got my free copy of Wheel of Katamari, and, um...

24:10.400 --> 24:14.280
I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet, and I was trying to make time to play

24:14.280 --> 24:17.640
Graffiti Kingdom, since I've had it for a month and haven't touched it yet.

24:17.640 --> 24:21.000
That's right, I still haven't touched the Hello Kitty game.

24:21.000 --> 24:25.400
Well, that I can understand, but, you know, Graffiti Kingdom, I was, like, drooling over, you know, when I got it,

24:25.400 --> 24:26.560
and I haven't even played it.

24:26.560 --> 24:35.560
But I'll get to it eventually, but now I have to go beg my contact to Konami for some copies of Extreme 2.

24:35.560 --> 24:41.560
I hinted to him that I wanted some, and now I will just bluntly say, can you send me some?

24:41.560 --> 24:43.560
So, we'll see.

24:43.560 --> 24:48.560
But yeah, and then I've been having this urge to buy stuff, and I haven't been able to find anything.

24:48.560 --> 24:53.320
walked around Best Buy aimlessly looking for something to buy and there was just nothing

24:53.320 --> 25:00.200
there at all. Nothing. That's all. Oh, and I'm eating a block of cheese. It's almost

25:00.200 --> 25:04.800
gone. I have to eat it because I have another block of cheese at home and they're planning

25:04.800 --> 25:08.800
on buying me another one. So, I, you know, and I saw A Chorus of Sprites and that was

25:08.800 --> 25:16.200
fun. It was a good movie. Good times. Alright, yeah. Bud, how was your week? How was your

25:16.200 --> 25:25.200
I did not get a chance to play Burnout 4 because my roommate scored a free Xbox from one of his friends and has been playing Jet Set Radio Future at all hours.

25:25.200 --> 25:27.200
Nothing wrong with that.

25:27.200 --> 25:29.200
We only have one set of hookups at a time.

25:29.200 --> 25:32.200
But lots of Kalamar...

25:32.200 --> 25:34.200
That game.

25:34.200 --> 25:37.200
Yeah, lots of that.

25:37.200 --> 25:41.200
And I can't kick anyone. Damn, that would be a lot of fun.

25:41.200 --> 25:44.200
Oh, you want to kick people? Here, I'll just...

25:44.200 --> 25:45.200
I'm running out of gas. I'm running out of gas.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.200
Wait. Oh, okay.

25:46.200 --> 25:47.200
Ooh! Ooh, yeah!

25:47.200 --> 25:51.200
Cool. I get to kick fun out of it.

25:51.200 --> 25:56.200
Anyway, um, I played trash pick.

25:56.200 --> 25:58.200
What?

25:58.200 --> 26:01.200
Played trash pick. Scored four IMAX last night.

26:01.200 --> 26:03.200
What is that?

26:03.200 --> 26:10.200
It's where you go around to people's trash, you know, the trash areas, and people have thrown out computers and there was four IMAX.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.200
People throw out IMAX?

26:12.200 --> 26:13.200
G3 IMAX.

26:13.200 --> 26:19.200
Loki? No, no, Loki, no. What, Loki? What?

26:21.200 --> 26:24.200
You mean they're good at least for their monitor? I mean, you can't...

26:24.200 --> 26:30.200
I highly say, you know, it's wrong to throw out anything that's not broken, especially computer-wise, unless it's really old.

26:30.200 --> 26:35.200
Because you can always use them for parts. Even if it is an iMac, you can still part that out for something.

26:35.200 --> 26:36.200
That's why we picked them up.

26:36.200 --> 26:42.200
For the monitor, at least. I mean, because, you know, a flat-screen monitor, that's... you shouldn't throw that away.

26:42.200 --> 26:47.200
didn't throw that away. Oh no no no, these are old ones, these are the CRTs. Oh. So they

26:47.200 --> 26:58.200
suck. They were where they belonged. How can people throw those away? Oh, oh okay. Oh my

26:58.200 --> 27:05.200
god! You wouldn't throw away another one, I want it. It's a G3. So? I can do something

27:05.200 --> 27:10.200
with it. Okay. You can make a flower pot out of it. They need hard drives and RAM, that's

27:10.200 --> 27:11.200
That's about it.

27:11.200 --> 27:12.200
Standard stuff.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.200
I have all that.

27:14.200 --> 27:22.920
In Promptu BBQ and we have We Heart something something something party last night.

27:22.920 --> 27:26.840
I believe what they've come up with in the chat room is We Heart Calamari.

27:26.840 --> 27:27.840
Like the appetizer.

27:27.840 --> 27:28.840
The squid.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.600
And everybody's spelling it right so I just left the chat room because everyone pissed

27:30.600 --> 27:31.600
me off.

27:31.600 --> 27:32.600
Aw.

27:32.600 --> 27:33.600
Calamari.

27:33.600 --> 27:34.600
I actually really do.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
But anyway.

27:35.600 --> 27:36.600
But I got off so I can still kick people.

27:36.600 --> 27:37.600
Okay.

27:37.600 --> 27:38.600
Go for it.

27:38.600 --> 27:39.600
That was pretty much it.

27:39.600 --> 27:46.600
Alright. Garrett, the pop music whore of Sacramento. What's up? How was your week? How was your

27:46.600 --> 27:51.960
day? My week's gone. How much pop music did you play? Since what? Since like however many

27:51.960 --> 27:58.920
months ago I was here? Yeah. Enough, I guess. Actually the other night, I don't know, I

27:58.920 --> 28:02.560
had some really crazy night and I started beating the shit out of everything again.

28:02.560 --> 28:08.360
Now I've actually beaten a handful of 41s. Very good. What's the highest they go, 45?

28:08.360 --> 28:09.360
43 43, wow.

28:09.360 --> 28:12.620
Yeah, I've beaten, I think, five 41s now.

28:12.620 --> 28:15.080
I just beat Rinse EX.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.760
I'm like, oh!

28:17.760 --> 28:20.280
And then I couldn't do it after that, of course, but there's just a couple.

28:20.280 --> 28:23.400
Do you have any more videos on the interweb of you playing Papa Music?

28:23.400 --> 28:25.200
Because I remember there used to be one on Bamani Style.

28:25.200 --> 28:28.520
Oh, I didn't even ask him to put that shit up.

28:28.520 --> 28:34.380
And then some asshole on Bamani Style totally was just making fun of me for it, and then

28:34.380 --> 28:37.240
he submitted his own video of him getting a better score.

28:37.240 --> 28:41.660
whatever I just I just sent it to some people just have to show how big their

28:41.660 --> 28:45.040
way I just sent to DJ P to show them like you know like oh I'm just playing

28:45.040 --> 28:51.160
with Adobe right now I'm you know putting this shit together but yeah

28:51.160 --> 28:55.100
okay my week's been alright I just started vacation on Friday and I'm on

28:55.100 --> 29:01.420
vacation for 10 days yay I'll be five days here and five days in Georgia and

29:01.420 --> 29:05.700
what are you doing in Georgia now I'm going to a wedding it's this girl I

29:05.700 --> 29:10.580
I grew up with and like her grandma is my one of my mom's best friends and you know

29:10.580 --> 29:14.100
They'll you know live together or whatever. But anyway, since I've never really been out of the state

29:14.100 --> 29:16.300
it'll be like going out of the country for me and

29:16.940 --> 29:18.940
So, I don't know that'll be fun

29:20.340 --> 29:22.620
Have fun with that humidity on the East Coast

29:22.620 --> 29:26.300
That's the first thing you'll notice when you visit the East Coast humidity at least that for me

29:26.420 --> 29:28.700
Okay, you step off the plane you go. She's

29:29.460 --> 29:33.500
Yeah, well just like I'm sure when people from the East Coast come to hear they go she's

29:33.500 --> 29:39.500
Jeez! What's wrong with you people? How can you live here? I can't breathe!

29:39.500 --> 29:41.500
I think for most it's a relief.

29:41.500 --> 29:44.500
Yeah, and the people from the Midwest just go sheesh anyways.

29:44.500 --> 29:46.500
Anyway.

29:46.500 --> 29:50.500
But yeah, today I was bored and slept all day and then got up and I'm like,

29:50.500 --> 29:52.500
oh, we caught a Murray Little Walmart.

29:52.500 --> 29:53.500
Ha!

29:53.500 --> 29:57.500
Yeah. I had to be a dork, and even though I already have the Japanese version,

29:57.500 --> 30:02.500
I went and bought the English version on Friday just so I could enjoy the king's English humor.

30:02.500 --> 30:06.260
And then, notice quite a few changes between the Japanese and American versions, like,

30:06.260 --> 30:10.220
a lot of them just really superficial changes, some of them really dumb, but whatever.

30:10.220 --> 30:15.620
But yeah, that was my day and week, I guess.

30:15.620 --> 30:16.620
Any other game?

30:16.620 --> 30:17.620
Huh?

30:17.620 --> 30:18.620
Logi, yes.

30:18.620 --> 30:20.300
What the hell was up with the manual?

30:20.300 --> 30:22.500
I looked at that and I'm like, what the hell is this?

30:22.500 --> 30:27.700
Because the screenshots, you made it kind of look like they were painted with watercolors,

30:27.700 --> 30:29.740
and I hope that's not what the game looks like.

30:29.740 --> 30:30.740
No.

30:30.740 --> 30:31.740
Okay.

30:31.740 --> 30:38.740
That's just the art director's style they do. A lot of the wallpapers and stuff they put up on the Japanese site, they look all weird like that.

30:38.740 --> 30:42.740
Some of them don't even look like they really have much to do with the game.

30:42.740 --> 30:46.740
And when he draws the characters in that style, they look all super goofy and whatever.

30:51.740 --> 30:56.740
My week and my day, I actually didn't do a whole lot, really. I've been pretty sad this week.

30:56.740 --> 31:02.740
Just work. A lot, a lot of work. And because of that, a lot, a lot of napping after work, because work kind of drains me a lot.

31:02.740 --> 31:09.740
So I didn't really go anywhere exciting or do anything that great. I really wish I had something to share, but I don't.

31:09.740 --> 31:18.740
I went to Fry's yesterday, and I was just, you know, I bought the K game there, and I was actually, my friend's monitor just about blew up.

31:18.740 --> 31:24.740
Apparently, like, it started shooting out blue sparks when he tried turning it on, which isn't a good thing.

31:24.740 --> 31:27.740
So, yeah, Loki's going, yeah!

31:27.740 --> 31:31.540
But we decided to go look at new monitors, and I kind of want a new monitor now, too,

31:31.540 --> 31:34.360
although the one I have is really good, I can't complain.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.780
I want a flat screen.

31:36.780 --> 31:37.780
It was free.

31:37.780 --> 31:42.540
I know it was, and that's why I can't complain about it, but I want a flat screen.

31:42.540 --> 31:44.020
I want a little black flat screen.

31:44.020 --> 31:45.020
I did the same thing.

31:45.020 --> 31:46.020
I do have a black flat screen.

31:46.020 --> 31:47.020
Exactly.

31:47.020 --> 31:48.020
See?

31:48.020 --> 31:49.020
It works a lot better.

31:49.020 --> 31:50.020
See?

31:50.020 --> 31:51.020
You know what I mean.

31:51.020 --> 31:52.020
And it'll be less heat, because it gets really hot in here during the show sometimes.

31:52.020 --> 31:54.020
Let's kill a few of us, and that'll cut down on the heat.

31:54.020 --> 31:54.520
Pow!

31:57.520 --> 32:00.520
Yeah, but I just, you know, that would help cut back on the heat,

32:00.520 --> 32:03.020
and, you know, maybe getting a better fan for this behemoth computer down here.

32:03.020 --> 32:06.020
I don't know if you can hear my fan. You probably can hear it over the air.

32:06.020 --> 32:06.520
Let me see if I can...

32:10.020 --> 32:12.020
You can't really hear it over the air, but it's...

32:12.020 --> 32:14.020
I have a ginormously loud fan.

32:14.020 --> 32:17.520
So, if I could get a better cooling thing in my computer, I bet it would be cooler in here, too.

32:17.520 --> 32:20.520
So, those are just things I'm thinking about for the future.

32:20.520 --> 32:24.160
So anyway, that was pretty much my week and day.

32:24.160 --> 32:26.520
Oh, I played DDR when I was at Fry's.

32:26.520 --> 32:29.160
They actually had the DDR Extreme set up.

32:29.160 --> 32:32.480
Not Extreme 2, but DDR Extreme set up with the two pads.

32:32.480 --> 32:35.320
And for soft pads that were taped to the ground,

32:35.320 --> 32:36.760
I'm surprised that things held up.

32:36.760 --> 32:39.240
I actually did a pretty decent job on the song I was playing.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.800
So that was kind of fun.

32:40.800 --> 32:45.020
So one last hurrah on DDR Extreme

32:45.020 --> 32:47.480
before Extreme 2 comes out this week, which would be what?

32:47.480 --> 32:49.120
Tuesday, Wednesday, I'll ask track.

32:49.120 --> 32:51.980
What day is it gonna be on the shelves?

32:51.980 --> 32:55.860
Wednesday? 27th. 27th will be on the shelf.

32:55.860 --> 32:59.060
That's the ship day. Alright. Oh, Tuesday's the ship day?

32:59.060 --> 33:02.700
I have no idea. I'm saying 27th. It'll be probably on shelves

33:02.700 --> 33:06.140
to 27th, because that's what we have in our system as the street date,

33:06.140 --> 33:09.740
which means when we get it. So that means that's probably when it's gonna arrive.

33:09.740 --> 33:13.300
27th. Probably is 27th.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.440
Sounds good. Although I know it's not gonna show up for a lot of stores until

33:17.440 --> 33:27.440
I'm not in any huge rush. I know a lot of people are really excited about DDR Extreme 2 because Konami's really kept a lid on it this time.

33:27.440 --> 33:34.440
There's still a lot, a lot of secrets people don't know about this game yet, including what the frickin' rest of the songs are outside the licenses.

33:34.440 --> 33:35.440
What game?

33:35.440 --> 33:36.440
DDR Extreme 2.

33:36.440 --> 33:37.440
What game?

33:37.440 --> 33:42.440
The dancing game with the arrow smash, like whack-a-mole, but with your feet. It's a cheesy eurobeat and stuff.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.440
I thought you said they were keeping it under wraps, but nobody knew about it.

33:45.440 --> 33:48.720
No, no, no. People know about the game. They just don't know anything about it. Shut up.

33:50.720 --> 33:51.280
Unlock show?

33:52.400 --> 33:53.040
Unlock show?

33:54.560 --> 34:00.720
I want to do one that I don't think we've got the setup to do it anymore. I know our mixing

34:00.720 --> 34:08.160
board will take my PS2 inputs right there, but I don't know what to do for video. So I don't

34:08.160 --> 34:12.080
know if we can do an unlock show. Because my Commodore 64 monitor got stolen out of the back

34:12.080 --> 34:17.480
in my car by some neighborhood brats, so I don't have anything to plug it into unless

34:17.480 --> 34:20.400
we could find like a little TV somehow.

34:20.400 --> 34:21.400
You might have one?

34:21.400 --> 34:23.880
We might have to do that then, like Wednesday night.

34:23.880 --> 34:24.880
We'll see.

34:24.880 --> 34:25.880
To be continued.

34:25.880 --> 34:26.880
To be continued.

34:26.880 --> 34:27.960
Well, we'll see.

34:27.960 --> 34:28.960
I'm still looking for...

34:28.960 --> 34:34.000
I was looking at Best Buy today, but they didn't have any, like, VGA connectors, because

34:34.000 --> 34:39.200
I'm getting one for my Xbox 360 because I need something to, you know, be high def because

34:39.200 --> 34:40.200
I don't...

34:40.200 --> 34:41.200
I'm not going to have a high def TV.

34:41.200 --> 34:48.200
I don't even know how the hell that's gonna work, because most of the games are in Hi-Def anyways, so if it's not in Hi-Def on your TV, what's that gonna look like?

34:48.200 --> 34:49.200
I mean, it's all messed up?

34:49.200 --> 34:57.200
No, I believe the regular Xbox, what it does is that if you want to play your games in widescreen, it will letterbox the games.

34:57.200 --> 35:02.200
There's the menu you can go into and change the options, so it'll probably just letterbox your games.

35:02.200 --> 35:04.200
So your video games will look like movies.

35:04.200 --> 35:08.200
Yeah, but they're all, you know, Hi-Res and stuff, and my TV's not gonna support that.

35:08.200 --> 35:12.200
I'm sure they can filter the graphics down really quickly.

35:12.200 --> 35:16.200
Well, anyways, I'm going to get a thing for my monitor, because it'll look pretty.

35:16.200 --> 35:20.200
Then that way the fiance can watch her TV and I can play my games.

35:20.200 --> 35:24.200
I remember the Dreamcast was really, really easy to hook up to a computer monitor.

35:24.200 --> 35:28.200
That was the first system that really made it super easy, hooking up to a VGA monitor.

35:28.200 --> 35:32.200
I think it kind of used that as a selling point, too.

35:32.200 --> 35:36.200
Really? There ain't nothing wrong with that.

35:36.200 --> 35:40.200
Good times.

35:40.200 --> 35:44.200
I miss my Dreamcast. I'm going to get it out and dust it off. I didn't have that many games for it.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.200
I mean, I just like PSO, but I think I had Typing of the Dead and

35:48.200 --> 35:52.200
Samba somewhere.

35:52.200 --> 35:56.200
I'm talking about pirated games.

35:56.200 --> 36:00.200
We don't have to keep it a secret. We got Loki on here.

36:00.200 --> 36:04.200
Like pirate games like Skies of Arcadia.

36:04.200 --> 36:10.200
I didn't play any games this week, okay? Good job! Seven days without, aw, so proud of you for overcoming your decision.

36:10.200 --> 36:15.200
That means that some chick's gonna climb out of his PSP monitor and steal a soul or something.

36:15.200 --> 36:21.200
Did you speak like a pirate on Monday? No, because I think that's retarded.

36:21.200 --> 36:25.200
Yarr, you be retarded!

36:25.200 --> 36:32.200
Um, yeah, I want to get off the Dreamcast and play some 2-2 Rocket, because that was a game I really sucked at, so maybe I can get good at it now.

36:32.200 --> 36:39.200
No, you know what I want to play? I want to play Power Stone, and I want to play Power Stone was Badass, and I want to play, um...

36:39.200 --> 36:43.200
It's all about Power Stone 2.

36:43.200 --> 36:47.200
No, there's another Dreamcast game I'm thinking of that I really want to play.

36:47.200 --> 36:48.200
Space Channel 5.

36:48.200 --> 36:49.200
Soul Calibur.

36:49.200 --> 36:51.200
Soul Calibur.

36:51.200 --> 36:56.200
The ultimate in Soul Calibur fun is playing with the fishing controller.

36:56.200 --> 36:59.200
That's right, I've heard about that, playing with a fishing controller.

36:59.200 --> 37:01.200
Because it's analog.

37:01.200 --> 37:06.200
And of course, every time you hit it, you're hitting basically one of the buttons, so it's really fabulous.

37:06.200 --> 37:09.200
Sounds rather athletic.

37:09.200 --> 37:16.200
If you want to know what playing the Nintendo Revolution is going to be like, try playing Soul Calibur with a fishing controller.

37:16.200 --> 37:20.200
Remind me to save that one for the podcast.

37:20.200 --> 37:25.520
I've been doing that for a long time, the fishing controller thing.

37:25.520 --> 37:31.200
I remember trying to play Soul Calibur with my Dreamcast DDR pad, and the only analog

37:31.200 --> 37:32.920
button is the Konami logo.

37:32.920 --> 37:33.920
Wow.

37:33.920 --> 37:37.240
So you can't really move.

37:37.240 --> 37:41.920
I remember, I don't remember whose house we did this at, it was either a Guana Girl's

37:41.920 --> 37:42.920
house or your house.

37:42.920 --> 37:44.120
Speaking of Project Justice, yeah.

37:44.120 --> 37:48.600
But we played Bust a Move Groove on dance pads once.

37:48.600 --> 37:49.600
I've done that.

37:49.600 --> 37:55.520
fun. The second one you can do it really easily on. Damn them for not making another game.

37:55.520 --> 38:00.480
All you do is put it in whatever the easy one was, which is all arrows, and you can

38:00.480 --> 38:05.040
play it. Damn them for not making another one. Seriously. Well, they did Dance Summit.

38:05.040 --> 38:08.600
I know, but Dance Summit doesn't count because they didn't release it here, and also, with

38:08.600 --> 38:13.460
the Dance Game craze being the way that it is, I can't believe that Squeenix, since they

38:13.460 --> 38:19.200
absorbed, you know, annex. I can't believe that they haven't done another one. They could

38:19.200 --> 38:24.160
do Final Fantasy dance. No, I'm kidding. They shouldn't do that. Um, but they could do something

38:24.160 --> 38:30.160
cute. You know they could. Stop doing the roleplaying. You know, they just need to put

38:30.160 --> 38:35.680
the whole Avix side, you know, get Avix back and do a whole new one. Seriously. You know,

38:35.680 --> 38:39.980
a friend of mine once had an interesting perspective. I don't know if you guys know about this,

38:39.980 --> 38:45.140
But way back when they beta tested or location tested DER 4th Mix.

38:45.140 --> 38:48.380
I don't know if it was location test or an early build of the game or what, but there

38:48.380 --> 38:53.620
was actually a song from the Dance Maniac series Eyes On Me.

38:53.620 --> 38:58.100
And of course that's the theme song from Final Fantasy 8, but it was a dance mix of it that

38:58.100 --> 39:00.580
appeared on one of the Dance Maniac's albums.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.300
I want to say like X5 or something.

39:02.300 --> 39:08.540
I know there was one on Zip Mania, but I think it was the version pulled from like X5 or

39:08.540 --> 39:09.540
something.

39:09.540 --> 39:12.780
Konami was supposed to be in DDR4thMix, well it got pulled at the last minute and the rumor

39:12.780 --> 39:17.540
was that Square took issue with it, so they just pulled the song.

39:17.540 --> 39:21.740
But my friend kind of at the time was like, well you know, Square probably does that because

39:21.740 --> 39:27.900
if they wanted to do a DDR style game with all their music, they could totally do it.

39:27.900 --> 39:34.380
I mean imagine like a DDR style game with all Square music, like Chocobo Dance Party.

39:34.380 --> 39:35.380
They could do it!

39:35.380 --> 39:36.380
They could totally do it!

39:36.380 --> 39:39.500
That would be a really good idea until Konami sues them.

39:39.500 --> 39:45.820
Not if it's a different style game, like Final Revolution.

39:45.820 --> 39:50.140
And you know, there was actually, because I have this game on Dreamcast, being the big

39:50.140 --> 39:53.300
Puyo Puyo nerd I am, I have Puyo Da.

39:53.300 --> 39:58.060
I remember you showing that to me once, and there's other style dance games Konami's not

39:58.060 --> 40:02.740
going to sue them over, like you know, Bust-a-Groove-Move and Puyo and

40:02.740 --> 40:09.480
Well, Puyo Da was more like Bust-a-Move except you built up your combos, and it worked sort

40:09.480 --> 40:16.200
sort of how you would do your drop on the other person by having a better combo than

40:16.200 --> 40:20.040
they did, and you would cancel out each other's combos, sort of like when you're playing P.O.P.O.

40:20.040 --> 40:25.480
It brought in a different innovation to it, as opposed to just the repetition, so that

40:25.480 --> 40:27.960
I think is where they were unique.

40:27.960 --> 40:32.120
Didn't one of the Final Fantasies have like a little DDR mini-game in it, or something

40:32.120 --> 40:37.160
where you hit the buttons, not with beatmania, where you hit the buttons and tune with the

40:37.160 --> 40:38.160
music?

40:38.160 --> 40:44.580
Rival Schools game that they came out with in Japan, which was the Evolution one, had

40:44.580 --> 40:50.240
a sort of like Batsu Breakdancing in it, had a DDR sort of mode in it, more like a you

40:50.240 --> 40:52.240
enter and the commands sort of like bust a move.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
And Grand Theft Auto had that.

40:53.240 --> 40:59.360
And, um, Card Fighter Clash, not Card Fighter Clash, um, the other, um, Marvel Capcom, not

40:59.360 --> 41:10.760
Marvel Capcom, SNK Capcom on the Neo Geo, had pretty much DDR in it, so.

41:10.760 --> 41:14.680
I think that, you know, there's an old-ass game, and I only know this game because it

41:14.680 --> 41:17.240
was my first DDR game I ever owned.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.640
It wasn't really DDR, it was my first dance game I ever owned.

41:20.640 --> 41:24.880
It was the Jungle Book dancing game for the PlayStation.

41:24.880 --> 41:25.880
I remember that.

41:25.880 --> 41:27.440
I remember showing you Third Mix.

41:27.440 --> 41:32.520
I remember the dance pad was like half the size of a normal dance pad because they make

41:32.520 --> 41:36.920
it for four year olds, but here I am playing on this Jungle Book dance pad, and it actually

41:36.920 --> 41:41.760
had a whole little game that went with it, and the arrows were in like little bubbles

41:41.760 --> 41:46.040
and you know it was very similar, very very similar to DER, except I think it went, scrolled

41:46.040 --> 41:49.820
down, but whatever, but you know and all the music was from the Jungle Book, you know,

41:49.820 --> 41:55.240
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too, it had all the little music in it, and you

41:55.240 --> 42:25.200
You know that music game I can't believe they have not made a sequel to?

42:25.200 --> 42:28.200
I'm kind of surprised too.

42:28.200 --> 42:29.200
Why?

42:29.200 --> 42:31.200
It was a great game.

42:31.200 --> 42:32.200
Yeah.

42:32.200 --> 42:33.200
They should do it.

42:33.200 --> 42:37.920
It was pretty much all one band that did the music, and then they had an outside artist

42:37.920 --> 42:42.320
come in and do all the graphics and the entire design for the game, so that may be a part

42:42.320 --> 42:44.200
of the reason, but I don't know.

42:44.200 --> 42:48.200
They just could find a new band and a new artist or whatever.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.200
Okay.

42:49.200 --> 42:50.200
Yeah.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.200
Cool.

42:51.200 --> 42:52.200
All right.

42:52.200 --> 42:54.340
I guess we're going to go to a break, guys, and we're going to come back and talk about

42:54.340 --> 43:00.420
some more things going on in the DDR world, and in this break we're going to start playing

43:00.420 --> 43:04.660
some tracks from the brand new UltraMix III V-Rare, which came out this week. In this

43:04.660 --> 43:11.100
break we're going to hear Nevaraka, who originally remixed the Day Behavior song Superstar in

43:11.100 --> 43:14.940
UltraMix II. They have their own song, it's called Evolution. Now the interesting thing

43:14.940 --> 43:19.940
about the UltraMix III V-Rare is that it has tracks from song packs on it. So this first

43:19.940 --> 43:24.820
This track is actually from Song Pack 14, so go figure.

43:24.820 --> 43:28.860
Akira Yamaoka with Love This Feeling has been remixed by Zonk.

43:28.860 --> 43:31.660
Zonk was the band that did Tittle Tattle in Ultra Mix 2,

43:31.660 --> 43:34.860
so it's a very, I don't know how to explain it.

43:34.860 --> 43:37.100
It's a very kind of groovy version of Love This Feeling.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.260
But the interesting thing is that,

43:38.260 --> 43:40.900
and they've kind of been picking at this on the DER Freak forums,

43:40.900 --> 43:45.140
is that instead of remixing the Chang Ma version,

43:45.140 --> 43:47.980
it really sounds like they went back and remixed the Akira Yamaoka one

43:47.980 --> 43:51.380
guitar freaks and drum mania love this feeling so that's kind of cool so it's a

43:51.380 --> 43:55.860
good remix and then we're gonna hear togo featuring sauna with jelly kiss but

43:55.860 --> 43:59.380
it's MIDI heads version the MIDI head smack mix and then the last track we're

43:59.380 --> 44:04.500
gonna hear this break is Chantanix with hash the Sun brand new song we're gonna

44:04.500 --> 44:08.820
have in DDR Ultramix 3 so we'll be back after this with more orange lounge radio

44:08.820 --> 44:10.820
Enjoy!

44:38.820 --> 44:45.820
Evolution

44:45.820 --> 44:52.820
Evolution

44:52.820 --> 45:02.820
Evolution

46:02.820 --> 46:17.340
Bugging down the street now and those are me Thinking had a little kiss, waving at my

46:17.340 --> 46:20.340
My face watching out for neighbors bugging the old folks

46:20.340 --> 46:22.340
Feels good to be home

46:22.340 --> 46:24.340
Love is breathing

46:24.340 --> 46:26.340
Born with a plan to shift

46:26.340 --> 46:27.340
You get the plan to get by

46:27.340 --> 46:29.340
Love is breathing

46:32.340 --> 46:34.340
Moving your body

46:34.340 --> 46:36.340
Born with a plan to shift

46:36.340 --> 46:37.340
You get the plan to get by

46:37.340 --> 46:39.340
Moving your body

49:39.340 --> 49:43.340
The

49:43.340 --> 49:47.340
The

49:47.340 --> 49:51.340
The

49:51.340 --> 49:55.340
The

49:55.340 --> 49:59.340
The

49:59.340 --> 50:03.340
The

50:03.340 --> 50:07.340
The

50:07.340 --> 50:12.340
We have to get down, get down, we have to walk the walk. When we get down here now we have to walk the walk.

50:12.340 --> 50:17.340
What are the next two people can do to lift the money up the next time in?

50:17.340 --> 50:21.340
Just like what you have a Mr. Streep next hand, I'll put him on top of me and he'll jump on top.

50:21.340 --> 50:37.340
Is there anything we can buy so we can get any pictures of all the wires?

50:37.340 --> 50:39.340
Woo!

51:07.340 --> 51:26.100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

51:26.100 --> 51:32.740
You know what else Captain Jack told me?

51:32.740 --> 51:34.020
Copy kills music.

51:34.020 --> 51:35.420
It does.

51:35.420 --> 51:37.260
You're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:37.260 --> 51:42.360
we're giving away free stuff, the drawing's only probably about an hour away, so make

51:42.360 --> 51:46.760
sure you get your emails in, freestuff at orangelandtrader.com, and answer some questions

51:46.760 --> 51:50.960
from before, you don't have to put your address in the email, but if you put it in there,

51:50.960 --> 51:54.240
we're not gonna disqualify you or anything, but if you send us two emails, you are gonna

51:54.240 --> 51:58.780
get disqualified, so send those in freestuff at orangelandtrader.com, and what is the free

51:58.780 --> 52:02.640
stuff we're giving away tonight? Well, if you win, and we'll have one listener during

52:02.640 --> 52:07.840
the live show tonight and one winner sometime this week after the podcast, you are going

52:07.840 --> 52:12.460
to win a pair of CDs, one of them being the DDR Max 2 V-Rare, which is kind of hard to

52:12.460 --> 52:17.560
find now, and the DDR EX2 V-Rare, which if you didn't pre-order the game, you ain't going

52:17.560 --> 52:21.680
to get anywhere else. So we're going to hook you up with those. So if you want to copy

52:21.680 --> 52:27.480
authentic copies, sealed copies of DDR Max 2 and DDR EX2, and who knows, we might just

52:27.480 --> 52:32.600
because we're loving and caring hosts, we might throw something else in the bag too

52:32.600 --> 52:36.520
too. But the one thing we will not be throwing in the bag will be a copy of In the Groove

52:36.520 --> 52:44.160
as defaced by Loki, Dark Sakura, and I will be a lot more forgiving for In the Groove.

52:44.160 --> 52:47.280
I'm not going to deface it, but I will definitely do my part.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.560
You're not going to throw $5 bills in with the viewers?

52:50.560 --> 52:54.920
No, no money. No money, because I don't have money, and I don't know about Dark Sakura

52:54.920 --> 52:58.960
and Loki, but even if I had money, I wouldn't give it to our listeners. No offense. Love

52:58.960 --> 53:00.960
you guys, but damn.

53:00.960 --> 53:01.960
We're cheap.

53:01.960 --> 53:07.960
The screen is expensive and the cast is cheap.

53:07.960 --> 53:14.960
By the way, my opinion of the songs in the break, 100% differs from yours.

53:14.960 --> 53:19.000
I was going to just get to that, and that is the songs that we played in the break from

53:19.000 --> 53:23.440
the UltraMix 3 VRayer, Dark Sakura, I know you weren't too thrilled with a couple of

53:23.440 --> 53:24.440
those.

53:24.440 --> 53:28.140
That version of Love That Feelin' was crap disguised as a song.

53:28.140 --> 53:29.140
You know what's interesting?

53:29.140 --> 53:31.440
It's a very polarized reaction on DDRFreak.

53:31.440 --> 53:33.760
I was reading on the forums over there a very polarized reaction.

53:33.760 --> 53:37.080
Some people love it, and some people just think it is poop.

53:37.080 --> 53:40.000
And I also don't like that version of Jelly Kiss either.

53:40.000 --> 53:42.280
Oh, I really like the Jelly Kiss ones.

53:42.280 --> 53:44.680
I'm not that big on the Love This Feelin' mix.

53:44.680 --> 53:46.080
I like Zonk, but...

53:46.080 --> 53:48.160
And the first one was very generic.

53:48.160 --> 53:51.580
Like photocopy generic.

53:51.580 --> 53:53.080
The ferret is being requested.

53:53.080 --> 53:54.480
The ferret is being requested?

53:54.480 --> 53:55.480
The ferret is being requested.

53:55.480 --> 53:59.040
Alright, we'll get out the ferret and take care of that request.

53:59.040 --> 54:12.240
We'll look for the ferret and try to get the ferret in on the show a little later.

54:12.240 --> 54:15.840
Hell if I know where those things went off to.

54:15.840 --> 54:18.800
We'll keep looking for it during the next break and try to get an appearance by the

54:18.800 --> 54:19.800
ferret.

54:19.800 --> 54:21.320
Oh, you know what reminds me, though?

54:21.320 --> 54:22.320
You know sometimes I...

54:22.320 --> 54:23.320
What do ferrets remind you of?

54:23.320 --> 54:27.460
No, I look out there on the internet sometimes because I like to do ego searches.

54:27.460 --> 54:28.680
You know what an ego search is?

54:28.680 --> 54:32.920
an ego search is when you go to Google and you type in your name and you see what sites

54:32.920 --> 54:36.740
come up. Well, I actually went to Google and typed in Orange Lounge Radio and I do that

54:36.740 --> 54:40.680
once in a while to see, you know, what the dirt is out there on the internet. And the

54:40.680 --> 54:46.240
weird thing is, is that there's a site out there that links to us as a news source. Like

54:46.240 --> 54:53.880
they have all these RSS feeds and we're one of them as a news source and the site is ferretmarketing.com

54:53.880 --> 54:59.960
Look, if you guys don't believe me, look at this, right here in the studio.

54:59.960 --> 55:02.000
In fact, I'll even post this in chat.

55:02.000 --> 55:04.720
This poor site is going to get hammered, but I don't care.

55:04.720 --> 55:07.320
I'm going to post this in chat.

55:07.320 --> 55:08.320
Check this out.

55:08.320 --> 55:09.320
Ferret Marketing.

55:09.320 --> 55:10.320
And here we are.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.200
Here is the URL for the awesome new source, orangelaunchradio.com, and it shows like our

55:13.200 --> 55:15.020
latest headlines.

55:15.020 --> 55:18.920
Why we are on ferretmarketing.com, I have no idea.

55:18.920 --> 55:19.920
Because you mentioned ferrets.

55:19.920 --> 55:23.000
There's a ferret fan that's listening to this show that must-

55:23.000 --> 55:26.240
pretty damn cute ferrets. They are cute ferrets that are on the page.

55:26.240 --> 55:29.400
I have no idea what the... I know, we'll look for it.

55:29.400 --> 55:33.880
It might, it might be in a, there's probably some in a box over there, so I'll dig through them on the next break.

55:33.880 --> 55:39.240
Anyway, Loki's currently defacing the copy of In the Groove that we're going to give away.

55:39.240 --> 55:43.160
And I'm helping. What have you done? I assure you, wait, what did you write on the manual here?

55:43.160 --> 55:46.480
I assure you this is not DDR, okay?

55:46.480 --> 55:50.400
What did you write on the cover there? I want to see what Loki wrote on the cover there,

55:50.400 --> 55:55.640
In the groove there this game sucks monkey balls and then signed it by Loki. That was very polite

55:55.880 --> 55:59.880
All right, I found a book called 500 things my ferret told me

56:01.400 --> 56:03.400
Let me guess

56:09.920 --> 56:11.200
And

56:11.200 --> 56:15.200
If you are an in the groove fan listening to this program and getting pissed off

56:15.920 --> 56:18.800
It's just a game. It's just a game people. It's just a game

56:18.800 --> 56:25.800
We have the right to our opinion. I don't think it sucks, but I do, I look forward to new DDR mixes more than I do in the game.

56:25.800 --> 56:30.800
I had people go, why are you ruining such a perfect, that's stupid, and I'm like, because I can.

56:30.800 --> 56:32.800
Exactly, so if you-

56:32.800 --> 56:39.800
If I was given a free iPod, I'd probably break it, but then if I didn't break it, I would give it away and do the exact same thing.

56:39.800 --> 56:46.800
Okay, so if you're wondering why are you bastards writing all over a copy of a degree and giving away-

56:46.800 --> 56:52.800
I personally bought this copy, okay, so my money was spent on this copy that I am sending out.

56:52.800 --> 56:58.800
So if it makes you feel better, In The Groove fans, Loki spent money, so he's essentially supporting In The Groove.

56:58.800 --> 57:04.800
But because he doesn't like it, he's turning it over to an In The Groove fan. And what better charity than that, huh?

57:04.800 --> 57:07.800
So stop bitching.

57:07.800 --> 57:13.800
We will get some pics of the defaced In The Groove. Probably not by the end of the show, but a little later on in the program.

57:13.800 --> 57:17.480
All right, a little later on in the week.

57:17.480 --> 57:19.320
What were the ferrets called?

57:19.320 --> 57:19.820
Lokies?

57:19.820 --> 57:20.840
One of our chatters, I think, is that.

57:20.840 --> 57:22.000
The Skoozies.

57:22.000 --> 57:23.680
But I don't remember exactly how it's spelled,

57:23.680 --> 57:25.260
because it's bringing up other companies.

57:25.260 --> 57:27.800
It's like S-C-O-O-Z-I-E-S.

57:27.800 --> 57:29.560
It came up with something completely different.

57:29.560 --> 57:30.160
I can hold on.

57:30.160 --> 57:30.760
I can find it.

57:30.760 --> 57:33.520
They have a whole website and a mini web game they can play.

57:33.520 --> 57:34.680
Was it adult-oriented?

57:34.680 --> 57:37.240
Because I bet Skoozies would be a pretty X-rated term

57:37.240 --> 57:39.240
for some genitalia, if you think about it.

57:39.240 --> 57:51.140
Show them your scoozy. You mean, what was it, S-E-Z-Y? Scuzzy. No, scuzzy is a little

57:51.140 --> 57:56.240
different there. Let's see, so moving on, I want to talk about some other things. Some

57:56.240 --> 58:00.320
things that people were talking about before the show, and I actually can't say I'm really

58:00.320 --> 58:03.460
up to date on what's going on here, so I'm hoping somebody might call in the Skype line

58:03.460 --> 58:07.660
later and clear up the air on what's going on, but I guess there's going to be some type

58:07.660 --> 58:18.540
of DDR thing on MTV. Not just any MTV, but MTV2. MTV2, of course. I remember when MTV2

58:18.540 --> 58:22.280
first launched, it was supposed to be, oh, since MTV, we're freely admitting is not a

58:22.280 --> 58:26.100
music-oriented station anymore, MTV2 is where we're going to play all the videos.

58:26.100 --> 58:30.940
It's where MTV goes to die. Basically. But guess what? Now, on MTV2,

58:30.940 --> 58:33.580
they don't just play videos anymore. They play other crap. They play old episodes of

58:33.580 --> 58:41.580
real world stuff. So, one of our listeners, Sephiroth1215 on our web forums actually wrote,

58:41.580 --> 58:46.260
I was randomly watching that video mod show yesterday and they showed a preview for the

58:46.260 --> 58:52.540
new episode that will be on Friday. This preview mentioned DDR being featured for a video.

58:52.540 --> 58:55.620
I think it's about time they did this, it only seems to make sense. Perfect for the

58:55.620 --> 59:01.100
time for the new release, I guess. Other than an Everything But The Girl video? Yeah, if

59:01.100 --> 59:07.480
actually have seen if you played 2DX third style and played five fathoms you

59:07.480 --> 59:13.760
can actually see an old-ass version of DDR like butterfly old-ass version of

59:13.760 --> 59:17.640
DDR in the video and you can see a five key like they're playing Jam Jam Reggae

59:17.640 --> 59:27.380
on the video or something so it's kind of cute what do you guys think MTV going

59:27.380 --> 59:32.720
to be on, uh, or DDR is going to be on MTV. Good thing for the community, bad thing for

59:32.720 --> 59:35.040
the community. I don't give a shit. What do you think?

59:35.040 --> 59:40.380
That means DDR has jumped the shark. DDR has officially jumped the shark? So does this

59:40.380 --> 59:45.640
mean you're an In The Groove fan now? Fuck no. Okay, if the originals jumped the shark,

59:45.640 --> 59:53.040
why would I go for a pale imitation? How about dance praise? Does that jump the shark? It

59:53.040 --> 59:55.040
It is the shark.

59:55.040 --> 59:56.640
Bugged.

59:56.640 --> 59:57.640
Your thoughts.

59:57.640 --> 59:58.640
DDR on MTV.

59:58.640 --> 59:59.640
Good thing, bad thing.

59:59.640 --> 01:00:00.640
I don't give a shit.

01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.640
Don't give a shit.

01:00:01.640 --> 01:00:02.640
It's on MTV, too.

01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:06.840
I don't even get MTV fucking, too.

01:00:06.840 --> 01:00:09.200
Garrett, a pop music horror.

01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:10.520
DDR on MTV.

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:15.240
Don't give a shit.

01:00:15.240 --> 01:00:16.720
I guess it's a good thing.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:18.500
I think it's a good thing.

01:00:18.500 --> 01:00:25.360
exposure for DDR despite how we might you know think MTV 2 is just stupid more

01:00:25.360 --> 01:00:30.040
exposure for DDR means more copies of the game get sold means we get an EX 3

01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:36.200
next year right so I say it's a good thing any exposure is a good thing if

01:00:36.200 --> 01:00:43.000
more people buy copies of it somebody in the chat room is saying I would love to

01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.520
to see In the Groove on MTV. And I have to say, when I was at E3, we were actually downstairs

01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:53.360
in Kenshia Hall, where Red Octane had a booth, and they had In the Groove set up. They didn't

01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.120
have it even set up the first day, but I think this was the last day of the show. Myself,

01:00:58.120 --> 01:01:01.520
and I don't know if you guys remember from the old Wednesday show, Rice Princess and

01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:08.440
Lanky Style, we were down there in Kenshia Hall, and we were at the In the Groove showing,

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:12.680
And MTV came by and filmed this guy very randomly playing.

01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.480
Thank you for pulling out my Dreamcast out of a box.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:19.720
MTV came by and was very randomly filming somebody

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.640
playing in the groove.

01:01:20.640 --> 01:01:24.000
But it was for like an MTV.com series.

01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:25.420
But what I thought was interesting

01:01:25.420 --> 01:01:28.560
is that one of the hosts was Chilon Liu and then

01:01:28.560 --> 01:01:30.160
some guy from Road Rules.

01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.600
But Chilon was, you remember right before the screen savers

01:01:34.600 --> 01:01:36.640
went kaput and changed into Attack of the Show,

01:01:36.640 --> 01:01:37.720
they had Chilon on there.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:42.580
she was kind of now if you really want to see if you want to really see what a

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:48.580
giggling girl is it's Chilon I mean it would and you know I know that sometimes

01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:58.000
that that phrase is overused but in her case it really was true so but she's

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:04.660
still doing things for MTV it looks like so interesting so they were doing in the

01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:09.660
So in some way it would have been on MTV, I suppose.

01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:13.660
So of course, EX2 is coming out this week. I'm curious what you guys think.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.660
Are you guys ready to pick this game up, or do you not care?

01:02:16.660 --> 01:02:20.660
Are you done with DDR home mixes? What do you think?

01:02:20.660 --> 01:02:25.660
I'm curious to hear from you, Garrett, because you are mostly an import gaming horn.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:29.660
You don't buy a whole lot of the US games, do you? I don't think you really do.

01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.660
Not as many as I watch. I don't buy a whole lot of games, period, anymore.

01:02:33.660 --> 01:02:34.780
I don't know what it is.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:41.580
But I lost interest of the US DDRs after Max 1 or 2.

01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.820
For the US, it's just the song that's just regurgitated

01:02:44.820 --> 01:02:50.140
from random transplants with crappy steps or songs that I

01:02:50.140 --> 01:02:51.260
already had in other versions.

01:02:51.260 --> 01:02:53.300
I'm like, no, it's kind of pointless.

01:02:53.300 --> 01:02:56.040
UltraMix stuff looked interesting, but I don't care

01:02:56.040 --> 01:02:57.500
to get an Xbox.

01:02:57.500 --> 01:03:00.300
So there's my feelings on that.

01:03:00.300 --> 01:03:02.780
So you're probably not going to buy EX2?

01:03:02.780 --> 01:03:05.380
No, the down arrow on my red Octane pad is broken.

01:03:05.380 --> 01:03:05.880
Dope.

01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:07.780
Alright.

01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:11.680
Loki, I'm kind of curious, what are your thoughts about EX-2?

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:13.380
I'm probably getting it free, so I don't care.

01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:16.580
But are you excited about it? Could you care less? What is it?

01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:19.280
I don't really have working pads, so, I mean...

01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:24.980
Well, I have working pads, I just haven't, you know, gotten them so that they're not, you know, breaking all the time.

01:03:24.980 --> 01:03:25.780
But, um...

01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:32.780
Yeah, I guess it's cool. I mean, I don't play DDR really right now, other than, you know, just StepMania stuff.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:37.780
I'm really... The setup they have in the house right now is not conducive to DDR, so...

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:39.780
Unfortunately.

01:03:39.780 --> 01:03:43.780
But yeah, it's cool. I mean, I can't wait to see what else they've got on there.

01:03:43.780 --> 01:03:49.780
Like, all the new songs and remixes and fun stuff that they have, and thank God they haven't spoiled it yet, so...

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:51.780
It'll be good.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:55.780
I didn't like the fact that they had hints last time, so.

01:03:55.780 --> 01:04:00.780
Dr. Sakra, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts about EX2, because you started DDR

01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:05.780
way back in the day, so you've seen this game really change, as have really all of us, but

01:04:05.780 --> 01:04:07.780
I know you've been on board for a long time.

01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:12.780
I think I'm going to get it, just because I'm also planning on finally throwing down

01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:16.780
a little bit of money and getting an ignition pad because I want to play at home some more.

01:04:16.780 --> 01:04:23.780
But, other than that, I'm not too excited about it, and the music isn't all that exciting

01:04:23.780 --> 01:04:24.780
anymore.

01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:30.660
And, you know, if I get something other than recycled, you know, puked trance, it's the

01:04:30.660 --> 01:04:35.380
only way I can describe it, like someone took generic trance, put it on a photocopier, and

01:04:35.380 --> 01:04:38.700
said, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song.

01:04:38.700 --> 01:04:44.700
I want a DDR with good music, with real music in it.

01:04:44.700 --> 01:04:50.840
I mean, I love all the Konami originals, all those are great, but if you're going to bring

01:04:50.840 --> 01:04:53.480
in something new, bring in something innovative.

01:04:53.480 --> 01:04:57.080
Throw us a freaking bone here, what kind of stuff, what kind of music would make you happy?

01:04:57.080 --> 01:04:58.080
Blur.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:04:59.080
I mean...

01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:00.080
Oh, I see.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.800
You want Feel Good Inc. in DDR.

01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800
That's not Blur, that's Gorillaz.

01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:05.880
Well, I know, but still.

01:05:05.880 --> 01:05:09.320
But I do want something that's got more substance to it.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:17.740
other than that you know just not all music you can dance to is is the techno

01:05:17.740 --> 01:05:21.700
stuff out of curiosity how do you feel about like the unleashed and dancing

01:05:21.700 --> 01:05:26.120
stage games the Europe ones that have the British Brit pop songs in them and

01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:31.320
stuff that makes me happy I mean I don't really care about like the

01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:36.220
uber pop but just that it's it's trying it seems like it's trying to cater more

01:05:36.220 --> 01:05:45.780
toward a broader scope of music, I think, you know, trying to... I need to just make

01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:47.380
my own DDR mix.

01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:53.940
I think a lot of folks in America, even if you're a fan of the American DDRs, even if

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:59.060
you're a fan of the Japanese home DDR mixes, almost everybody agrees that the British folks

01:05:59.060 --> 01:06:02.620
get really good songs. They get really good mixes.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:12.000
There's actually an interesting thread on a DDR Freak, because I mod the UK forum, talking

01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:16.380
about which one would you more prefer has been a discussion in this one thread.

01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:20.720
I'll try to hunt it down and get more info out of it, but it was really kind of interesting

01:06:20.720 --> 01:06:29.680
seeing who would want what out of what mix, and seeing that there was sort of on the other

01:06:29.680 --> 01:06:35.680
side that they want some of what we get but I don't see why some of what we get

01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.560
kind of cool though we get so we've got I honestly thought that the last release

01:06:39.560 --> 01:06:45.360
was so much better you know with a skulk and no Ultramix to Ultramix oh and I

01:06:45.360 --> 01:06:48.200
think Ultramix 3 is gonna be pretty good too I mean I know you didn't like those

01:06:48.200 --> 01:06:51.400
particular songs but if you remember the Ultramix one v-rare it didn't have a

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:58.000
whole lot of what the game really had in store so we'll see but I I haven't heard

01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:01.600
anything that's excited me yet. In fact, just what we played in the

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:07.440
break, the last break, really made me sad. Well, we're about to get to another break

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:10.360
pretty soon here. We're gonna hear four more songs. One of them is a classical

01:07:10.360 --> 01:07:14.240
remix. I don't know if you'll dig that or not. We'll see. We're gonna get to that. In

01:07:14.240 --> 01:07:17.600
fact, I think we'll get to it right now. How's that sound? Yay! Alright, then when

01:07:17.600 --> 01:07:22.360
we come back, we're gonna do the Skype line. Siggy's gonna call in and he's

01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:27.640
gonna talk about a brand new Konami related CD that came out this week. So

01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:32.280
we're gonna talk about that and at least I think it was this week I think so if

01:07:32.280 --> 01:07:36.400
not he'll correct me on it I'm sure and some more stuff when we come back we'll

01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:40.180
do the cage match sometime during this next segment as well and the rest of your

01:07:40.180 --> 01:07:44.960
calls on the skype line when we come back after this so in this break let's

01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:52.120
see what songs we're gonna hear here we're gonna do starting it off Moshek

01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:55.500
with moment 40 will be the first song that we hear and I believe this is the

01:07:55.500 --> 01:08:00.180
one that's a bit of a classical song remix so we'll hear that DJ Taka colors

01:08:00.180 --> 01:08:03.620
but remixed by Midihead so that should be interesting

01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.260
John D and Spesh have done a version of Bylalakia carried with the wind and

01:08:09.260 --> 01:08:13.420
it's very interesting you might remember Johnny and Spesh did the max 300 remix

01:08:13.420 --> 01:08:17.500
from Ultramix 2 so that'll definitely be very interesting to hear and then we're

01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:23.540
gonna hear Big Idea with Dansa De Juca and Big Idea is the one that did Byla

01:08:23.540 --> 01:08:28.740
LaSamba and ToeJam, which made its way into 2DX, Happy Sky.

01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:31.460
I can't think of ToeJam without thinking of ToeJam and Arl.

01:08:31.460 --> 01:08:32.460
I know, I know.

01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:33.460
Yeah, me neither.

01:08:33.460 --> 01:08:36.060
It's just because you're a Sega whore, and so are you, and that's okay, because Sega's

01:08:36.060 --> 01:08:37.100
a good thing.

01:08:37.100 --> 01:08:40.300
I can reach behind me and pull Segas out of my, out of your closet.

01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:41.300
I know, I know.

01:08:41.300 --> 01:08:43.660
I keep all my Segas in the closet.

01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.460
They're trapped in the closet.

01:08:46.460 --> 01:08:47.460
We'll be back after this.

01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:54.460
off with Moshek Moment 40, UltraMix III V-Rare here tonight on Orange Laundry.

01:09:17.460 --> 01:09:45.460
He said fun, he said fun He said fun, he said fun

01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:38.740
Feeling blue, I'm thinking of you I'm almost a fool to let you walk away

01:10:38.740 --> 01:10:44.740
Tears in my eyes today Make my world the color of blue

01:10:44.740 --> 01:10:52.240
You, singing of you, I was a fool to let you walk away

01:10:52.240 --> 01:10:58.740
Dancin' my accident with my girl, her father was a dick

01:10:58.740 --> 01:11:12.240
I'm a magic, a kiss, orange on the floor, yeah, green on tourmaline

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:20.240
Yeah, no matter how low I love you, baby, I'm mild

01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:25.240
I'm covered in colors with sun

01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:31.240
Only one, but baby, I'm loved

01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:36.240
I'm loved without you

01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:43.020
I'll cry like a fire in the moon

01:11:43.020 --> 01:11:50.220
I'll fall alone without you

01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:56.740
I'll cry alone

01:11:56.740 --> 01:11:59.540
I'm thinking of you, I'm thinking of you

01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:04.340
Oh, I won't, won't, I'll let you go away

01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:10.340
The tears in my eyes today make my world the color of blue

01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:13.340
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking of you

01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:18.340
But I was a fool to let you walk away

01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:26.740
Here's the fire I could aim at my world, the color of blue

01:12:48.340 --> 01:13:08.340
I'm waiting for him before you say all the things you might have done in your life

01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.340
And I say, please, let me help you

01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:17.340
Yes, I know, oh, I know

01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:51.340
If you're me, you're supposed to see

01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:57.340
You will never go back again

01:15:51.340 --> 01:16:13.940
Whoop, dead air there, sorry guys.

01:16:13.940 --> 01:16:19.740
We forgot to put a little, I should say I forgot to put a little sweeper coming back.

01:16:19.740 --> 01:16:24.660
So I was too busy doing my own spin on defacing the copy of In the Groove here.

01:16:24.660 --> 01:16:26.700
I'm actually writing in the table of contents right now.

01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:30.220
I actually added something to the table of contents in the instruction manual.

01:16:30.220 --> 01:16:34.120
I put how to get sued on page 69, how to get sued.

01:16:34.120 --> 01:16:39.980
And now I'm putting contents, I'm writing next to contents, contents of my ass.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:41.780
I'm going to put contents of my ass.

01:16:41.780 --> 01:16:44.940
I'm putting special, really crappy artwork in the inside cover.

01:16:44.940 --> 01:16:45.740
Yes.

01:16:45.740 --> 01:16:49.260
So again, this is us defacing In the Groove

01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:55.320
because we can. And to whoever wins this, Dark Soccer is leaving a very special message

01:16:55.320 --> 01:17:01.340
and some artwork in there inside the art, like you have to, you would have to pull out

01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:06.220
the insert to see it on the inside. So whoever wins this is really going to enjoy this. Speaking

01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:10.480
of winning things, here, look, I don't want this anymore. Speaking of winning things,

01:17:10.480 --> 01:17:14.940
you this week, yeah, you guys need to sign it too. We're also going to have Bugd and

01:17:14.940 --> 01:17:19.100
garrett are popping music or leave their work on it

01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.340
but this week you can right now you can win uh... the e x to be rare and that

01:17:23.340 --> 01:17:24.740
the max to be rare

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:26.260
some folks getting in there

01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:30.300
uh... uh... in our contest so if you want to join in you only have a little

01:17:30.300 --> 01:17:31.460
bit of time left

01:17:31.460 --> 01:17:33.000
free stuff

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.440
at orange laundry dot com all you have to do is send us an email no trivia

01:17:36.440 --> 01:17:38.000
question

01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:39.080
praise for the show

01:17:39.080 --> 01:17:42.880
we will not fill your email to spammers were not into that we just want to have

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:47.240
a fair contest, very random, so just send an email and then we're going to pick a random

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:53.160
number and that message in the inbox is our winner. It's a very scientific process. So

01:17:53.160 --> 01:17:57.440
DarkSakura is written in the insert. She actually drew a picture of Emi from DDR. She drew a

01:17:57.440 --> 01:17:58.440
picture.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:00.040
They're really bad ones since I don't have a good pen.

01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:06.680
It says, ITG makes Emi cry. And Emi is actually crying in the picture. And Caker Death, which

01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:09.000
is kind of random, but she wrote Caker Death at the bottom.

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.080
And I wrote something else on here too.

01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:19.440
game smells like butt on the insert. Don't forget to actually sign it at some point.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:24.000
And just so you know, you know, we're not all in the groove haters. I realize Ark Soccer

01:18:24.000 --> 01:18:27.880
and Loki are in the groove haters. I actually wrote my defacing, the other thing I did,

01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:33.380
I wrote under, on the title, it says in the groove, I put is okay. And then I drew a little

01:18:33.380 --> 01:18:38.000
unemotional face. So I put in the groove is okay. Because that's how I feel. In the groove

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:43.000
is OK.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:45.520
Now what we're going to do is get over to our Skype line.

01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.520
And if you are interested in calling in the Skype line,

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:51.960
head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:53.680
click on Interact With Us.

01:18:53.680 --> 01:18:56.640
And you, too, can be on.

01:18:56.640 --> 01:18:58.160
Neil, you don't count.

01:18:58.160 --> 01:19:00.000
Bugs, god damn you.

01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.040
You, too, can be on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:04.240
I actually wanted to pick up.

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:05.480
Neil, you're a bastard.

01:19:05.480 --> 01:19:06.440
I hate you.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:07.520
All right.

01:19:07.520 --> 01:19:08.760
I'm just too quick, I'm sorry.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:11.840
No, I intentionally am bringing this call to the front because I want to speak to this

01:19:11.840 --> 01:19:12.840
person.

01:19:12.840 --> 01:19:13.840
Siggy, you there?

01:19:13.840 --> 01:19:14.840
Oh, shit.

01:19:14.840 --> 01:19:17.760
Siggy, you there?

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:18.760
Can you hear me?

01:19:18.760 --> 01:19:19.760
I didn't do it!

01:19:19.760 --> 01:19:20.760
Yeah, it's slow.

01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.400
Okay, it's very slow.

01:19:22.400 --> 01:19:23.400
Oh, that stinks.

01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.400
So does I, Siggy.

01:19:25.400 --> 01:19:26.400
I know.

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:27.840
Siggy, I'm going to try calling you.

01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:28.840
I'm going to call again.

01:19:28.840 --> 01:19:30.960
Okay, I'm going to call you.

01:19:30.960 --> 01:19:34.560
I hope you heard that, that I'm going to call him, see if we have a little better luck.

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:38.840
I need to turn off my pornography torrents.

01:19:38.840 --> 01:19:40.280
That is an annoying ass ring.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.400
Two ringy dings.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:46.000
The rest of you guys are trying to call in right now.

01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.640
Call back in a little bit, because we wanted to bring

01:19:47.640 --> 01:19:49.840
this call to the front, because he actually has a

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:52.560
contribution to make to tonight's show.

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:54.440
Not that the rest of you don't have contributions to make to

01:19:54.440 --> 01:19:57.760
tonight's show, but this is, you know, super important.

01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.080
Well, shit.

01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:02.680
It's just ringing and ringing and ringing.

01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:03.600
OK.

01:20:03.600 --> 01:20:09.600
Ziggy's going to actually just restart his PC, so we're going to let him restart his PC, and we'll take another call in the meantime.

01:20:09.600 --> 01:20:11.600
Ziggy!

01:20:11.600 --> 01:20:13.600
Zaku.

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:14.600
What's up, man?

01:20:14.600 --> 01:20:20.600
You lucked out. The other call, I had to drop it and push it back to later, because the connection's slow, so you get to be first tonight.

01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:22.600
Weee!

01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600
What's on your mind?

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:27.600
Well, let me see, DDR Extreme 2 coming out in two days, and...

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.600
Did you enter the contest?

01:20:29.600 --> 01:20:31.600
Yeah, I entered the VRARE one.

01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:32.600
Good man.

01:20:32.600 --> 01:20:38.600
And basically MTV2 hoarding the shit out of DDR Extreme 2 via video mods.

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:42.600
Yeah, what is this video mod show now? I don't watch MTV2, so you gotta tell me.

01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:50.600
Basically, video mods is a show, an MTV2 show where they take video game characters and make them reenact music videos.

01:20:50.600 --> 01:20:52.600
You know, from Main Street Music.

01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:55.600
Oh fuck, it's that show that's gonna have DDR?

01:20:55.600 --> 01:20:59.600
Yeah, the only one I've ever seen, that is The Sims dancing to Hey Ya.

01:20:59.600 --> 01:21:07.600
My best bet is that they're going to make all the DDR2 characters, Dance 2, Stompalls get busy,

01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:15.600
which is the only mainstream track that Joe Sixpack probably knows, and probably the rest of America knows.

01:21:15.600 --> 01:21:21.600
Who else in America would know about My My My or Silence, for that matter?

01:21:21.600 --> 01:21:30.600
Now, Silence I could see, but what I remember from the Silence video, it wasn't really anything, all that, so I could see the Get Busy video.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:36.600
It's gonna be Get Busy. I'm betting everything on it, without a shadow of a doubt. You know how MTV is.

01:21:36.600 --> 01:21:39.600
Well, it could be something from Extreme 1.

01:21:39.600 --> 01:21:41.600
No, they're gonna use Extreme 2.

01:21:41.600 --> 01:21:55.600
I can tell you right now, you know, that's the most recent game, you know, MTV's not stupid, they're going to whore out the game, I'm just, you know, we'll just have to wait till Friday to see MTV.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.600
Alright, we'll see. You want to make some money on that wager?

01:21:58.600 --> 01:22:00.600
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:22:00.600 --> 01:22:11.600
I am going to have an extra Max 2 v-rare after these contests, so maybe I should offer to send Zaku the Max 2 v-rare if I'm wrong.

01:22:11.600 --> 01:22:13.600
Nah, that would be too nice of me to do. Sorry, Zaku.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:27.600
Also, you already know by now that UltraMix 3 v-rare reveals a few songs that might be in the game, like 250 BPM, Looney Tunes, and the Medley.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:32.200
The medley that's at the end that has a bunch of remixes of songs that are going to be in song packs

01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:35.900
Yes, it possibly does reveal songs that will be in the game

01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:40.200
Again, it's not for sure, but typically, song packs every mix

01:22:40.200 --> 01:22:46.500
This right there, this is kind of like retribution for the fact that info was leaked last year with Ultramix 2

01:22:46.500 --> 01:22:52.600
So I guess Konami's trying to sneak in a few hints for those who know enough to realize them

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:56.300
Possibly, I honestly think Love Me Do is a shoo-in

01:22:56.300 --> 01:23:03.900
Because the folks at Konami know that we are big Kiriyama Okahores and all his songs do

01:23:03.900 --> 01:23:05.540
very well in the DDR games.

01:23:05.540 --> 01:23:09.180
So he has to have something in extreme hope.

01:23:09.180 --> 01:23:14.340
Do the higher-ups of Konami really listen to the station?

01:23:14.340 --> 01:23:21.340
Besides people who work as beta testers slash step-makers, I mean the ones above them.

01:23:21.340 --> 01:23:27.340
They're the ones listening and trying to, you know, and trying to reflect, and pretty much take DDR into that form.

01:23:32.340 --> 01:23:34.340
Anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:39.340
GameStop and the other players are still showing BNA US as November 1st is the release date.

01:23:40.340 --> 01:23:44.340
I can tell you that's a load of crap. I assure you it will not be November 1st.

01:23:45.340 --> 01:23:48.340
I'm saying the same thing too right now. I don't know why they can't get into their...

01:23:48.340 --> 01:23:53.340
What are you saying? Who needs to be schooled on this, Zaku?

01:23:53.340 --> 01:23:58.340
Uh, EB. EB Games needs to be schooled.

01:23:58.340 --> 01:24:01.340
EB Games needs to be schooled on the release date of BeatMania USA.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:03.340
They need to push it by a few months.

01:24:03.340 --> 01:24:04.340
It's not coming up this year.

01:24:04.340 --> 01:24:07.340
They need to push it, uh, four more months.

01:24:07.340 --> 01:24:13.340
EB Games management, if you're listening, um, EB Games management, update your damn systems.

01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:15.340
That game will not be out this year, I guarantee it.

01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:16.340
Mhm.

01:24:16.340 --> 01:24:20.340
Ultramix and, uh, what was it, that stuff got put on?

01:24:20.340 --> 01:24:28.340
Ultramix, DDREX3, er, EX3, EX2 will be out this year, and, uh, the Karaoke Party is gonna be out before the year's out, right?

01:24:28.340 --> 01:24:30.340
Yeah, Karaoke Party got posted.

01:24:30.340 --> 01:24:32.340
That's my big deal.

01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:38.340
Karaoke Party will definitely be out this year. Those will be Konami's big pushes for Christmas, and then next year they can start another game.

01:24:38.340 --> 01:24:42.340
Plus, with your Xtreme 2, you know, you get to play Karaoke Party, a demo.

01:24:42.340 --> 01:24:44.340
So really really

01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:49.280
No one told me this. All right. All right, and that's yes pretty much about it

01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:56.500
Digital life Expo next month October 14th and 15th 16th. Don't remind me because I can't go I can't go

01:24:56.500 --> 01:25:01.840
but if you can know that but I'm just giving I'm just I'm just plugging the damn thing because you know,

01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:08.600
There's people on the East Coast that would want to go so I might as well plug it and just get you know

01:25:08.600 --> 01:25:12.080
So tell them the date so they don't forget it.

01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:14.120
Zaku, one other quick question for you guys.

01:25:14.120 --> 01:25:18.880
I heard, for you, I heard Miyamoto was in New York City today.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:22.720
Miyamoto the creator of so many Nintendo fabulous games.

01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:23.720
Yeah.

01:25:23.720 --> 01:25:24.720
Did you go check this out?

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:25.720
Right in your backyard?

01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:31.800
Uh, I, I didn't notice that because you know, as I said, I'm like 30 miles away in college

01:25:31.800 --> 01:25:35.040
from, I'm 30 miles from the city, I'm 30 miles north of the city.

01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:36.800
Nothing to train won't get you to.

01:25:36.800 --> 01:25:40.800
Yeah, because, you know, I'm still waiting for that first paycheck for my new job.

01:25:40.800 --> 01:25:41.800
Alright, alright.

01:25:41.800 --> 01:25:43.800
So, that's it.

01:25:43.800 --> 01:25:44.800
Well, maybe he'll be back.

01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:46.800
Alright, alright.

01:25:47.800 --> 01:25:48.800
Alright, Zaku.

01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:50.800
I'm letting you go so we can take other calls.

01:25:50.800 --> 01:25:51.800
Alright, man.

01:25:51.800 --> 01:25:52.800
Have a good one.

01:25:52.800 --> 01:25:53.800
Peace.

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:54.800
Take care.

01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:55.800
Alright.

01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:57.800
We're going to go to another call.

01:25:57.800 --> 01:26:00.800
I apologize to those of you guys that are also trying to get in,

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:02.800
but I definitely, definitely want to get Siggy in here

01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:09.060
it was kind enough to get us some previews of a brand new Konami artist-related album

01:26:09.060 --> 01:26:14.620
that was out this week, so I want to make sure he can get in here, and we're just going

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:18.500
to wait for him to call. Then we'll get to some more calls on the Skype line. Remember,

01:26:18.500 --> 01:26:22.720
if you want to call us on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to orangelaungeradio.com

01:26:22.720 --> 01:26:25.600
and click on interact with us. Now let's try this again. Siggy, you there?

01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:29.760
Yep, I'm here, Skye. Much better. How you doing, my friend?

01:26:29.760 --> 01:26:30.960
I'm doing fine.

01:26:30.960 --> 01:26:32.640
Can we hear him in studio okay?

01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.080
Good?

01:26:33.080 --> 01:26:33.360
Yeah.

01:26:33.360 --> 01:26:34.560
Okay, good.

01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.400
Segi, now I've been kind of keeping it a secret because I know you wanted to talk about it.

01:26:38.400 --> 01:26:39.440
What are we going to hear?

01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:41.920
What are you going to let our listeners hear tonight?

01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:49.920
As of September 16, 2005, Guitar Freak's drum radio artist Asaki released his debut album, Shin Kyoku.

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.880
Cool.

01:26:51.880 --> 01:26:58.840
So there are actually four new original tracks by Asaki, and the six of them are from a, you know,

01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.040
from Bimondi games like Guitar Fix Trip Media and Pop It Music.

01:27:03.040 --> 01:27:10.040
So we're going to play track number two, which is the first original song by Asaki.

01:27:10.040 --> 01:27:15.720
It's a mid-tempo song with very heavy guitar riffs and such.

01:27:15.720 --> 01:27:18.480
So here's Firefly Sotaru.

01:27:18.480 --> 01:27:20.040
We're just going to be playing clips of these songs, too.

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.240
We're not going to play the whole thing, because they're like six-minute-long songs.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:22.600
Yeah, just a minute-long clips, yeah.

01:27:22.600 --> 01:27:23.120
All right, here we go.

01:27:23.120 --> 01:27:26.400
This is track two, one of the brand new Asaki songs.

01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:55.080
Now, see, I dug that one.

01:27:55.080 --> 01:28:00.080
That should have been on the UltraMix 3 vrare. Wouldn't that be cool to have a song like that on UltraMix 3?

01:28:00.080 --> 01:28:01.080
We'll see.

01:28:01.080 --> 01:28:02.080
Yeah.

01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080
Alright, what else are we going to hear?

01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:06.080
Even though I don't play Xbox, yeah, I think so.

01:28:06.080 --> 01:28:09.080
Still, still would be a good thing. Okay, then fine, EX2, whatever.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:18.080
Alright. The second track, which is another second Asagi original, is a very soft piano ballad.

01:28:18.080 --> 01:28:28.080
It's a very, how should I say it, very slow, very soft, so here's the sound of Conveil since Yogo no Oto.

01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:35.080
All right, here's track five. Yes, that's track five. I was looking for it. Here it is, piano ballad.

01:28:58.080 --> 01:29:06.180
...

01:29:06.180 --> 01:29:11.180
Now that would not be a good song for DDR.

01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:13.180
Definitely not.

01:29:13.180 --> 01:29:16.180
Maybe Keyboard Mania, like a one-face song on Keyboard Mania.

01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:18.180
Alright, what else are we going to hear?

01:29:18.180 --> 01:29:22.180
The third track is a track 9, a third new Asaki original,

01:29:22.180 --> 01:29:26.180
which is kind of like a taken page out of Tsumina Gura Tokana's life.

01:29:26.180 --> 01:29:33.000
wife and this is a this is the divine comedy which is you know a popular poem

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:36.820
written by Adante Algeri aka Adante's Inferno so here it is

01:29:36.820 --> 01:29:43.820
And this is where the album gets its name. This is the title track.

01:30:06.820 --> 01:30:30.300
That's pretty cool.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:31.300
I like that.

01:30:31.300 --> 01:30:32.300
Very diverse.

01:30:32.300 --> 01:30:35.420
This seems like it would be a good just kind of chill out music playing in the background

01:30:35.420 --> 01:30:38.420
while you're trying to study or something. This is good, I like this.

01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:44.420
If you guys... That last one makes me think sort of of a post-gog to Malus Miser.

01:30:44.420 --> 01:30:45.420
A little bit, a little bit.

01:30:45.420 --> 01:30:48.420
Again, if you're just joining us, we're listening to tracks from the brand new

01:30:48.420 --> 01:30:51.420
Asaki album, which was just released this week.

01:30:51.420 --> 01:30:54.420
Siggy's with us, and what else are we going to hear tonight, Siggy?

01:30:54.420 --> 01:30:58.420
Oh, I just forgot to mention that track nine was the longest Asaki song,

01:30:58.420 --> 01:31:00.420
which is about nine minutes long.

01:31:00.420 --> 01:31:02.420
That was a behemoth of a song, yes it was.

01:31:02.420 --> 01:31:07.420
I would expect any song that's going to have Dante's Inferno is going to be kind of long, so.

01:31:07.420 --> 01:31:09.420
Okay, what else are we going to hear?

01:31:09.420 --> 01:31:16.420
And this one's the last track, you know, the last Asaki original, which is the most ordinary Asaki song that I've ever heard.

01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:19.420
It's with Bubble in the Clear Sky.

01:31:19.420 --> 01:31:22.420
Alright.

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:27.420
No one is going to have your eye, that's what it is, well

01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:31.420
Ain't somebody who's hanging on to you

01:32:01.420 --> 01:32:21.140
Let's hear, for those folks that may not recognize Asaki too much, what's one of these songs

01:32:21.140 --> 01:32:24.740
that was actually in a previous Bemani game?

01:32:24.740 --> 01:32:32.540
The very first Asaki song that he ever, that the Bemani series, he got released was Sanagi

01:32:32.540 --> 01:32:35.820
from Guitarpix Romania, seventh mix, sixth mix.

01:32:35.820 --> 01:32:39.260
All right, and yes, this one's in rotation on our station as well, so you've probably

01:32:39.260 --> 01:32:46.260
heard this song before, but it's a long mix, so here's a little clip of this one.

01:33:09.260 --> 01:33:16.260
Alright, those are tracks from the brand new album by Asaki Shinkyoku, did I say that right?

01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.260
Yeah.

01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.260
Cool.

01:33:18.260 --> 01:33:19.260
Shinkyoku.

01:33:19.260 --> 01:33:20.260
Shinkyoku, hey I'm learning.

01:33:20.260 --> 01:33:26.060
Alright, so now if folks want to order this album, how can they pick it up, Siggy?

01:33:26.060 --> 01:33:32.780
I haven't checked out some online retailers, but I think PlayStation should be starting

01:33:32.780 --> 01:33:33.780
their orders.

01:33:33.780 --> 01:33:35.780
CD Japan too, right?

01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:36.780
No.

01:33:36.780 --> 01:33:42.780
Garrett actually ordered this CD because he was actually happy to hear these preview tracks

01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.780
because he hasn't gotten this CD yet, so where did you pick this up from?

01:33:45.780 --> 01:33:50.780
I ordered mine from Playasia, but I thought Golly's...

01:33:50.780 --> 01:33:53.780
I don't know, did they change the release date on Golly's art book?

01:33:53.780 --> 01:33:56.780
Because I thought it was supposed to come out on the same day, but it obviously changed

01:33:56.780 --> 01:33:59.780
so I'm not getting it until October when Golly's book comes out.

01:33:59.780 --> 01:34:02.780
So, oh well. I get to listen to it now.

01:34:02.780 --> 01:34:18.780
I'm just going to tell Garrett that the file that I sent to Sky, it has the pictures of the cover, the CD, the lyrics to it.

01:34:18.780 --> 01:34:20.780
Yeah, I saw those.

01:34:20.780 --> 01:34:22.780
Ah, okay.

01:34:22.780 --> 01:34:26.780
He was looking over my shoulder while I was browsing it, so.

01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:31.220
All right. Well, thank you so much, Siggy, for sharing that with our listeners tonight.

01:34:31.220 --> 01:34:35.460
We appreciate you kind of keeping a pulse on what's going on abroad because I don't

01:34:35.460 --> 01:34:36.460
sometimes.

01:34:36.460 --> 01:34:39.700
I don't blame you. I don't blame you.

01:34:39.700 --> 01:34:43.080
I appreciate it. There's just too much. It gets overwhelming sometimes. And Garrett really

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:48.300
helps fill me in on a lot of that stuff because he, you know, can understand a lot of Japanese

01:34:48.300 --> 01:34:51.820
and Jamie does too. And, you know, between the two of them, I get filled in on what's

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:59.500
going on but um yeah otherwise i'm lost i'm just i'm just a dumb whitey hey i don't blame

01:34:59.500 --> 01:35:04.140
your don't just don't blame your color just uh i know i know it's it's just a joke kids

01:35:04.140 --> 01:35:14.540

01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:17.540
Um, Edward is a poppin' whore, right?

01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.540
Yeah.

01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:21.540
2DX bastard here, nice to meet you.

01:35:21.540 --> 01:35:24.540
Oh no, I'm a 2DX bastard too. I'm a 2DX and poppin' bastard.

01:35:24.540 --> 01:35:30.540
Well, Siggy insists that he is THE 2DX bastard, so you're gonna have to be like the 2DX wench.

01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:32.540
Yeah, well I love keyboard mania!

01:35:32.540 --> 01:35:33.540
I know, I wanna be a-

01:35:33.540 --> 01:35:34.540
Screw y'all!

01:35:34.540 --> 01:35:36.540
I'm a keyboard mania hussy.

01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:38.540
No. No, no, no, no.

01:35:38.540 --> 01:35:42.540
Alright, Siggy, thanks for calling in. We're gonna try and get to one more call, so I gotta let you go, okay?

01:35:42.540 --> 01:35:44.540
It's all about Stance, Stance, Stance!

01:36:12.540 --> 01:36:15.980
Torrance my friend no I'm kidding I know I know you wouldn't do that during the

01:36:15.980 --> 01:36:22.060
show all right so what's on your mind I was there at Nintendo World this morning

01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:30.720
you got to see Miyamoto today hell no no what happened okay this was the plan me

01:36:30.720 --> 01:36:35.420
and my crew is gonna go down there at 7 a.m. and relax and get on the line one

01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:39.500
of my friends that go down there 10 o'clock Saturday night and check it out

01:36:39.500 --> 01:36:47.500
I said, I'll go down to 10. If I see a line, I'm grabbing my bags and I'm going, I never left. I did not think it was going to be that packed.

01:36:48.500 --> 01:36:50.500
Wow. It was crazy.

01:36:51.500 --> 01:36:55.500
They didn't announce this with very much advance notice about the Miyamoto thing, did they?

01:36:56.500 --> 01:37:00.500
Only on NintendoWorld.com and if you're on the Nintendo mailing list.

01:37:01.500 --> 01:37:05.500
Wow. Well, that kind of sucks. I'm sorry to hear about that. It got so crowded over there.

01:37:06.500 --> 01:37:07.500
So there was like 12 people?

01:37:07.500 --> 01:37:15.500
No, like 12 million. Believe me, I know so many straight guys that would go down on Miyamoto.

01:37:15.500 --> 01:37:22.500
It's amazing. He's a god to some people, so I'm sure people came out of droves. No, I do know some.

01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:25.500
There was about 800 people there.

01:37:25.500 --> 01:37:32.500
Alright, well, wow. Well, it's too bad you didn't get to see him, but how's the Nintendo store?

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:38.500
It's pretty sweet. It's really sweet. It's really nice because it looks so modern, you know?

01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:44.500
Before when it was a Pokemon it looked all kitty, but it looks really modern, like so 90's chic, you know?

01:37:44.500 --> 01:37:46.500
Very cool. Very cool. All right.

01:37:46.500 --> 01:37:48.500
I'm also...a few more things and then I'll go.

01:37:48.500 --> 01:37:49.500
Sure.

01:37:49.500 --> 01:37:53.500
I'm seeing a link to the chat of a bunch of us hanging out today, trying to get inside.

01:37:53.500 --> 01:37:59.500
Okay, so check that out. Ron Chan just posted that in our chat room there. It's a photo bucket link of pictures from today.

01:37:59.500 --> 01:38:03.120
uh... and and maybe if you look very carefully you might be one little pixel

01:38:03.120 --> 01:38:04.940
that happens to be miyamoto

01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:07.800
it's three pictures of miyamoto okay cool

01:38:07.800 --> 01:38:09.200
you got it from the window and

01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:13.700
the first i was on the line he flew in from detroit he was there since twelve

01:38:13.700 --> 01:38:16.020
noon saturday

01:38:16.020 --> 01:38:17.320
wow

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.940
see what i mean to me about some crazy guys are you looking at that link right

01:38:20.940 --> 01:38:22.820
now with the

01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:25.020
i i see ron chan that must be the land

01:38:25.020 --> 01:38:28.020
Yeah, that's me, that's Link, yeah, that's my friend, uh, Greg, my Minish hat.

01:38:28.020 --> 01:38:31.020
You dressed up, you dressed up in a Minish cap there?

01:38:32.020 --> 01:38:36.020
No, somebody actually came with a Minish cap. That was my classic Link hat that was made for me.

01:38:36.020 --> 01:38:38.020
You bought a Minish cap and it came with a person?

01:38:39.020 --> 01:38:40.020
No, I wish.

01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:46.020
But, um, if you see, like, the little pink hats my friend made, those, the Princess Pea hats, if you notice those.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:52.020
You guys are nuts. Here's Luigi, we're looking at him. Somebody in a Luigi hat. That's awesome.

01:38:52.020 --> 01:38:56.620
We were watching Advent Children.

01:38:56.620 --> 01:38:59.900
You guys are such nerds, but that's why I love ya.

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.540
You think that's something?

01:39:01.540 --> 01:39:05.580
When Miyamoto came to the window, we all ran to the side.

01:39:05.580 --> 01:39:08.900
Do you remember the Super Mario Brothers 3 commercial where they were chanting Mario?

01:39:08.900 --> 01:39:12.460
We were chanting Mario just like that.

01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.420
Second time we came to the window, we were shouting, Nintendo!

01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.420
Nintendo!

01:39:16.420 --> 01:39:25.420
People throwing up, holding up their Nintendo controllers, pads, consoles, power pads, power gloves, u-forces.

01:39:25.420 --> 01:39:30.420
Somebody walked down the street with an autographed power glove. I'm telling you.

01:39:30.420 --> 01:39:32.420
Autographed by who?

01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:33.420
That is so bad.

01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:39.420
Oh yeah, MTV was there and they're going to put a bunch of this on the whole Xbox video gaming special next month.

01:39:39.420 --> 01:39:43.420
Wait, you're going to be on the Xbox video game special?

01:39:43.420 --> 01:39:47.600
they do like a video game special a week that xbox comes out and they did a complete cover

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:55.320
of miyamoto being in town wait but but but do you see the problem with this is it just

01:39:55.320 --> 01:40:03.520

01:40:03.520 --> 01:40:12.640

Hey, so can we be first in line to order our Xbox 360 here?

01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:22.140
No.

01:40:22.140 --> 01:40:24.640
Yeah, I could see them interviewing Miyamoto.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:28.140
So what do we have to look forward to in Halo 3?

01:40:28.140 --> 01:40:31.140
We actually joke about that online, okay?

01:40:31.140 --> 01:40:34.140
Well, at the end of, if you don't beat Halo 3 in a certain amount of time,

01:40:34.140 --> 01:40:38.140
then the moon is going to crash into the world and...

01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:42.140
We're sorry, Master Chief, but our princess is in another castle.

01:40:42.140 --> 01:40:47.740

Yeah, that's the thing we're going to give away.

01:42:10.500 --> 01:42:13.500
We have to talk about this during the break, how we're going to give this away, so we'll see.

01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:14.500
In pieces.

01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:16.500
Alright, in pieces.

01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:17.500
Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:22.500
In this break, we're going to do one of my favorite songs from the UltraMix 3 v-rare because it sounds like synthpop.

01:42:22.500 --> 01:42:24.500
It's Raindancer with Come With Me.

01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:29.500
And then we're going to get to another song which I don't have labeled because I'm a dumbass.

01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:32.460
It's Track 10.

01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:33.300
What was Track 10?

01:42:33.300 --> 01:42:36.540
I think it's another, um, poop.

01:42:36.540 --> 01:42:37.020
No, it's not.

01:42:37.020 --> 01:42:39.580
But we're also going to do the UltraMix 3 medley in this

01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:42.500
break, the song pack medley, so you guys can hear little

01:42:42.500 --> 01:42:45.220
clips of Love Me Do and 250 BPM.

01:42:45.220 --> 01:42:46.500
Rainbow Flyer.

01:42:46.500 --> 01:42:48.700
Damn it, I knew it was the one I was missing.

01:42:48.700 --> 01:42:49.980
I couldn't hear you.

01:42:49.980 --> 01:42:51.500
Rainbow Flyer is going to be the other song we

01:42:51.500 --> 01:42:52.260
hear in this break.

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.900
So we'll be back after this with more

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:55.540
Orange Lounge Radio.

01:42:55.540 --> 01:43:24.260
Come with me now Life in the distance

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:27.260
Showing me the way I've forgotten

01:43:27.260 --> 01:43:30.260
I've gone too far in confusion

01:43:30.260 --> 01:43:34.260
I've been lost

01:43:34.260 --> 01:43:37.260
It may take some time

01:43:37.260 --> 01:43:40.260
But somehow I will get

01:43:40.260 --> 01:43:44.260
To my destination

01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:47.260
Now I'm leaving it all behind

01:43:47.260 --> 01:43:51.260
I don't know what it is I expect to find

01:43:51.260 --> 01:43:56.260
But I'll always want you here by my side

01:43:57.260 --> 01:44:00.260
Now I'm leaving you so behind

01:44:00.260 --> 01:44:04.260
I don't know what it is I expect to find

01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:08.260
But I'll always want you here by my side

01:44:09.260 --> 01:44:11.260
Ciao with me

01:44:12.260 --> 01:44:14.260
Ciao with me

You've been wrong, won't let go

01:49:52.440 --> 01:49:56.440
What are you waiting for?

01:50:14.440 --> 01:50:16.440
Nico, meow.

01:50:16.440 --> 01:50:18.440
Nico, meow.

01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.440
Nico, meow.

01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:21.440
Oh, ass!

01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:55.480
or Loki as well so give that a try we are going to give away those CDs any

01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:59.800
minute now so free stuff at orange laundry calm if you're not in there yet

01:50:59.800 --> 01:51:04.320
you might just be SOL but what I do want to point out is something actually a

01:51:04.320 --> 01:51:08.020
suck arena brought this to my attention there's a brand new page posted over at

01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:13.480
Konami style that actually has some more information about guitar freaks V the

01:51:13.480 --> 01:51:18.440
home release of course that being a big surprise at the Tokyo game show this

01:51:18.440 --> 01:51:23.340
here is that they are going to revive the Guitar Freak Stromania series with V and look

01:51:23.340 --> 01:51:28.360
at this, look at that, that is an ASC ladies and gentlemen, that is the arcade style controller.

01:51:28.360 --> 01:51:32.780
Completely, look at that, they have the little metal cord and everything, and the little

01:51:32.780 --> 01:51:38.280
strap, that is going to be bad ass, I want one. So check that out, and the link again

01:51:38.280 --> 01:51:44.560
is posted in the chatroom, it's over at konamistyle.jp in their custom factory, aren't those things

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:51.560
going to be expensive though? Yeah, I know. I am not a big enough fan of Guitar Freaks.

01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:54.560
Do they have an extra hole so you can use it for other things?

01:51:54.560 --> 01:52:00.060
Yeah, but you know I'm going to have one at my house because my husband is the world's

01:52:00.060 --> 01:52:01.560
biggest Guitar Freaks fan.

01:52:01.560 --> 01:52:06.160
Well, you know, they advertise the game as Guitar Freaks and Drummania is being released,

01:52:06.160 --> 01:52:10.240
so right now with the arcade-style controller for Guitar Freaks, I believe they're Konami

01:52:10.240 --> 01:52:13.800
styles doing the petition thing to get their polls and see like, okay, how much do you

01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.580
fan do you really want it okay so there may there may be you know

01:52:18.580 --> 01:52:22.800
drum mania arcade controller or something like that following it

01:52:22.800 --> 01:52:28.080
eventually or soon after or something which will be equally or more scary with

01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:34.720
the price yeah I just I'm just I'm so excited they're bringing guitar freaks

01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:37.320
back though what I'm what I'm really excited and I hope they do is that they

01:52:37.320 --> 01:52:42.360
really just fill up these mixes with old songs that they missed out on like

01:52:42.360 --> 01:52:44.960
because you know otherwise we're never going to get a lot of the great songs

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:47.960
that we're in like you know fifth six and all that stuff like I don't know

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:52.720
fireball and I'm trying to every song that keeps coming to my mind was a

01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:56.560
licensed song because fifth had a lot of them haru spring I don't know but we we

01:52:56.560 --> 01:52:59.400
need to see some of these songs on a home mix so I really want to see that

01:52:59.400 --> 01:53:08.200
so anyway check that out check that out on Konami style all right what we do now

01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:11.280
we're gonna place a very special phone call we've got a phone call that we need

01:53:11.280 --> 01:53:15.280
to make and we're gonna place that right now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

01:53:15.280 --> 01:53:18.840
call somebody who's actually in the hospital and that's somebody who's been

01:53:18.840 --> 01:53:22.720
on the show previously but it's not a bad reason why she's in the hospital

01:53:22.720 --> 01:53:28.120
you'll see why momentarily first I got to make sure I'm putting in the number

01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:33.400
correctly here we'll call this number here doo doo doo doo doo hopefully this

01:53:33.400 --> 01:53:38.880
connects this would be quite embarrassing if this old damn thing

01:53:38.880 --> 01:53:43.200

01:53:43.200 --> 01:53:46.960

01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:12.300

So I'll be able to post some pictures on the net.

01:55:32.300 --> 01:55:35.300
Alright. And if those of you guys are wondering why we have...

01:55:35.300 --> 01:55:36.300
I have a live journal.

01:55:36.300 --> 01:55:37.300
Uh-huh.

01:55:37.300 --> 01:55:40.300
And I can go on Orange Lounge, um, if, if...

01:55:40.300 --> 01:55:45.300

01:56:12.300 --> 01:56:13.740
That's so cute.

01:56:13.740 --> 01:56:16.220
We're so happy for you.

01:56:16.220 --> 01:56:17.820
Thank you so much.

01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:20.380
I'm so happy and proud, too.

01:56:20.380 --> 01:56:22.340
I'm so glad I can share it with you guys.

01:56:22.340 --> 01:56:23.220
No problem.

01:56:23.220 --> 01:56:25.060
I'm so glad to be here.

01:56:25.060 --> 01:56:26.060
Get well soon.

01:56:26.060 --> 01:56:28.940
And I'm asking Daniel to send me the hospital information

01:56:28.940 --> 01:56:31.580
so I can hopefully visit soon, like this week sometime.

01:56:31.580 --> 01:56:34.300
Well, hopefully you won't be there much longer, but you know.

01:56:34.300 --> 01:56:35.540
Oh, she's out tomorrow?

01:56:35.540 --> 01:56:36.340
Oh, I didn't know.

01:56:36.340 --> 01:56:37.380
Yeah, I'm out tomorrow.

01:56:37.380 --> 01:56:38.100
Oh, well, crap.

01:56:38.100 --> 01:56:39.260
Well, I still want to come see the baby,

01:56:39.260 --> 01:56:41.020
so I'll have to come to your house.

01:56:41.020 --> 01:56:42.100
I know it's a long drive.

01:56:42.100 --> 01:56:46.660
but maybe I can do it in the next couple weeks or so.

01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:47.380
OK.

01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:51.220
All right, well, I'll contact you offline.

01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:51.780
OK.

01:56:51.780 --> 01:56:54.140
All right, well, Anita, congratulations once again

01:56:54.140 --> 01:56:57.060
from all of us here at Orange Launch Radio to you.

01:56:57.060 --> 01:56:59.620
One of our regulars having a baby, we're so excited.

01:56:59.620 --> 01:57:00.820
So congratulations.

01:57:00.820 --> 01:57:04.140
And tell Donovan we said hi.

01:57:04.140 --> 01:57:05.180
Oh, I will.

01:57:05.180 --> 01:57:07.100
Thank you guys very much, too.

01:57:07.100 --> 01:57:07.980
No problem.

01:57:07.980 --> 01:57:08.480
Kiss.

01:57:08.480 --> 01:57:14.480
everybody, all my friends, all my Bamani friends, and all my Orange Munch friends. Hi, everybody.

01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:15.480
Share those drugs.

01:57:15.480 --> 01:57:18.480
Kisses! Kisses, honey. Take care.

01:57:18.480 --> 01:57:19.480
Okay.

01:57:19.480 --> 01:57:20.480
All right. Bye-bye.

01:57:20.480 --> 01:57:21.480
Bye-bye.

01:57:21.480 --> 01:57:22.480
Bye-bye.

01:57:22.480 --> 01:57:27.480
Aw, so sweet. I apologize to our listeners that Skype is a little bit crappy. I don't

01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:30.920
really know how else to phrase that. Skype's running a little bit crappy. But our chat

01:57:30.920 --> 01:57:35.720
room is just full of congratulations there. Daniel's actually in chat right now, so if

01:57:35.720 --> 01:57:38.120
We want to give congratulations to Daddy.

01:57:38.120 --> 01:57:41.240
Daddy's in chat right now, OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:45.400
Click on chat, and he's there to take those good wishes back

01:57:45.400 --> 01:57:47.600
to Anita from those of you guys in chat,

01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:49.840
since you weren't able to talk to her on Skype.

01:57:49.840 --> 01:57:51.880
All right, well, I think it's time now for us

01:57:51.880 --> 01:57:56.960
to move into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:57:56.960 --> 01:58:00.320
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs

01:58:00.320 --> 01:58:02.640
for you, back to back to back, and you guys

01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:04.240
vote for your favorites.

01:58:04.240 --> 01:58:09.360
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

01:58:09.360 --> 01:58:13.920
Vibani and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on

01:58:13.920 --> 01:58:15.360
this station when we're not here.

01:58:15.360 --> 01:58:18.360
What we're going to hear first is last week's winner.

01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:21.760
You only get to hear a clip of it because it's last week's winner, so therefore you've

01:58:21.760 --> 01:58:24.380
already hypothetically heard this song.

01:58:24.380 --> 01:58:30.040
It is Yuzo Koshiro, and it's from Langan Midnight Maximum Tune.

01:58:30.040 --> 01:58:31.600
Did I get that right this time?

01:58:31.600 --> 01:58:32.600
Yes.

01:58:32.600 --> 01:58:33.600
Right on.

01:58:33.600 --> 01:58:40.600
is Destination Blackout, and it was Mrs. Dark Sakura's pick from last week.

01:58:41.100 --> 01:58:44.600
Don't roll your eyes at me, marriage is bliss, blah blah blah.

01:58:44.600 --> 01:58:45.100
Is it?

01:58:45.100 --> 01:58:52.100
Alright, here it is, a clip of song number one, Destination Blackout here on Orange Lounge, the cage match.

01:59:15.100 --> 01:59:19.100
We're doing it one way or another

01:59:24.100 --> 01:59:26.100
One way or another

01:59:35.100 --> 01:59:36.100
No more empathy

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:38.100
One, two, three, four.

02:00:06.100 --> 02:00:30.300
One, two, three, four!

02:00:30.300 --> 02:00:35.300
One, two, three, four!

02:00:35.300 --> 02:00:49.180
Alrighty, that was a clip of song number one, Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

02:00:49.180 --> 02:00:53.020
Received some very good marks on last week's show, so we'll see if it continues to win

02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:57.180
for a second week in a row, or if it falls prey to one of our challengers tonight.

02:00:57.180 --> 02:00:58.180
Loki, you're up first.

02:00:58.180 --> 02:01:00.780
What did you pick for us tonight?

02:01:00.780 --> 02:01:23.780
Well, I got a copy of the Diverse 9 album, and this is one of the tracks, actually one of the last tracks, and I remember listening to the demo of this back when I was looking at the tracklist scenes when we covered it on the show, and this song reminded me of the Black Mages, but, you know, it's a song that you've all heard before, so, enjoy!

02:01:23.780 --> 02:01:31.940
All right, what is the name of this here Dorisia with V. Yeah. All right Dorisia with V. Enjoy

02:05:23.780 --> 02:05:44.060
That one's coming to you courtesy of Diverse Systems.

02:05:44.060 --> 02:05:50.820
That's Dorisia with V. Let's go around and see if V gets an A or an F.

02:05:50.820 --> 02:05:51.820
Dark Sakura.

02:05:51.820 --> 02:05:53.740
I couldn't get into it.

02:05:53.740 --> 02:05:56.740
It just was... disjointed.

02:05:56.740 --> 02:05:58.740
Disjointed. Okay.

02:05:58.740 --> 02:06:04.740
So, it gets... it was above average, but definitely below the greatest thing I've ever heard, so...

02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:08.740
Definitely better than just about everything I've heard off that v-ware, so...

02:06:08.740 --> 02:06:11.740
It gets a... seven and a half.

02:06:11.740 --> 02:06:13.740
Seven and a half. Loki!

02:06:13.740 --> 02:06:16.740
Get the nine. I've been blasting this into my car.

02:06:16.740 --> 02:06:18.740
Bugged.

02:06:18.740 --> 02:06:20.740
Seven.

02:06:20.740 --> 02:06:22.740
Garret.

02:06:22.740 --> 02:06:36.740
I'm gonna give it an 8. I liked it, but I don't know. Something about Bahmani songs in Cage Match is weird to me, but I still liked it, so I'm gonna give it an 8. So, it was cool.

02:06:36.740 --> 02:06:51.740
Alright, my song, we're gonna do it tonight. Song number 3. Now, a lot of people have been ripping on Zonk over that remix, so I thought, okay, I'm gonna give Zonk a chance with one of their original songs. So I'm gonna put Zonk in tonight's Cage Match, because I really couldn't think of anything else.

02:06:51.740 --> 02:06:59.740
It's not a Bahmani song. It's not a Bahmani song. It's an original Zonk song. Kiss my butt.

02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:13.740
Alright, this is Zonk, song number three tonight with Nervous, Excited, Delighted. Check this out. It's one of their original songs from their latest EP which is called... Shit, I don't remember the name of this EP. I think it's...

02:07:13.740 --> 02:07:15.740
I would order it just on that name alone.

02:07:15.740 --> 02:07:17.960
Half Human, thank you, Half Human is the name of it.

02:07:17.960 --> 02:07:20.500
All right, here it is, Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

02:07:20.500 --> 02:07:21.900
Enjoy.

02:07:21.900 --> 02:07:50.900
Just to show why I'm still a tear

02:07:50.900 --> 02:07:55.900
Rushed at hammering strings

02:07:55.900 --> 02:07:58.900
Nellowed dramatic guts

02:07:58.900 --> 02:08:00.900
Slapping energy

02:08:00.900 --> 02:08:07.900
Beating up to the scary center stage

02:08:09.900 --> 02:08:12.900
Why don't we talk in a merry way?

02:08:12.900 --> 02:08:14.900
Try to keep the world from breaking

02:08:14.900 --> 02:08:17.900
And the pressure is beating me from every direction

02:08:17.900 --> 02:08:20.400
Nothing makes it, I got nothing but the fear I left it

02:08:20.400 --> 02:08:21.900
What? We can't fail

02:08:21.900 --> 02:08:23.400
It's time to go on

02:08:23.400 --> 02:08:25.400
It's time to write this piece and get the show on

02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:27.400
We party and we grieve and we get to take my food

02:08:27.400 --> 02:08:29.400
And we're doing it, yeah, you and me

02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:30.400
That's how we do it

02:08:30.400 --> 02:08:34.400
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

02:08:34.400 --> 02:08:37.400
What a fright

02:08:37.400 --> 02:08:40.400
Something dangerous

02:08:40.400 --> 02:08:43.400
Love gets excited, it's a lie

02:08:43.400 --> 02:08:48.400
It's not that dangerous

02:09:00.400 --> 02:09:05.400
Silence before the explosion

02:09:05.400 --> 02:09:10.400
Space is in slow motion

02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.400
Strike up a code

02:09:15.400 --> 02:09:19.400
We are ready to go

02:09:19.400 --> 02:09:21.400
Now it's time to get with us

02:09:21.400 --> 02:09:24.400
And get this week, we'll fix you up

02:09:24.400 --> 02:09:26.400
So wave your hands and kick your butt

02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:29.400
It's time that we get dangerous

02:09:29.400 --> 02:09:33.400
Firelight full of foreshadows

02:09:33.400 --> 02:09:38.400
Something dangerous

02:09:38.400 --> 02:09:48.400
Love is excited, delighted, something dangerous

02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:53.400
Play dress and clothes to offer though

02:09:53.400 --> 02:09:59.400
This must be angsty rock and roll

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:04.400
Pre-delayed and terrified

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:09.400
And let's highlight the night

02:10:09.400 --> 02:10:28.400
Night, night, night, night

02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:32.400
Nervous, excited, delighted

02:10:32.700 --> 02:10:36.400
Something dangerous

02:10:38.300 --> 02:10:42.300
Nervous, excited, delighted

02:10:42.700 --> 02:10:46.700
Something dangerous

02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:52.400
Nervous, excited, delighted

02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.400
Something dangerous

02:10:56.400 --> 02:11:07.400
Now that this day is a lie, there's something dangerous

02:11:07.400 --> 02:11:27.400
Do you want this? Do you need this?

02:11:27.400 --> 02:11:47.400
Do you want it? Do you need it?

02:11:57.400 --> 02:12:09.400
Song number three in tonight's cage match is Zonk. Nervous, excited, delighted. Let's see if that song delighted the folks here in the studio. But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys in chat.

02:12:09.400 --> 02:12:15.400
My first impression of it was that I was liking it, I was getting into it, and then it started to repeat.

02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:21.400
And it's sort of like, duh, duh, duh, repeat, repeat...

02:12:21.400 --> 02:12:23.400
Oh, it's over!

02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:32.400
So, um, I like it better than Loki's pick, because it had a cool kind of groove to it, and wasn't all disjointed, but it did sort of...

02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:35.400
Are you saying it had a good beat, and it was easy to dance to?

02:12:35.400 --> 02:12:39.600
to dance to. No, it had a good beat, but I would probably fall asleep dancing to it.

02:12:39.600 --> 02:12:47.600
So, um, it gets an 8.5. 8.5 from Dark Sakura. Loki! It gets, like, a 7.5, because it was

02:12:47.600 --> 02:12:53.320
better than the remix that was on the Ultramix, um, 3 soundtrack, but, uh, they do some weird

02:12:53.320 --> 02:12:57.800
stuff. It, it was okay, though. I didn't find it repetitive or anything like that. It was

02:12:57.800 --> 02:13:01.800
I didn't want it, nor did I need it. Five.

02:13:01.800 --> 02:13:05.800
Good. I zonked out six.

02:13:05.800 --> 02:13:09.800
Um, I actually, you know, I kinda liked it. I liked it better than

02:13:09.800 --> 02:13:13.800
Tittle Tattle, and I liked it better than their Ultramix 3 remix. And I think if they

02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:17.800
DDR cut that, they'd lose a lot of the repetitiveness of the song, and I think it'd be a pretty groovy

02:13:17.800 --> 02:13:21.800
cut for DDR, so I hope they consider it for Ultramix Sweat 4.

02:13:21.800 --> 02:13:25.800
Or, heck, the next Ultramix will probably be a 360 game.

02:13:25.800 --> 02:13:32.800
Ultramix 360, the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match, song number one

02:13:34.040 --> 02:13:41.040
is Destination Blackout, last week's winner. And song number two you can vote for tonight

02:13:41.040 --> 02:13:59.500
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Dorisia with Thee.

02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:03.660
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Zonk with Nervous Excited Delighted.

02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:19.020
Place vote now, send a private message to Skye in the chatroom with your vote.

02:14:19.020 --> 02:14:21.180
Now you can flood me with private messages, that's okay.

02:14:21.180 --> 02:14:24.100
I need to interrupt for something that's really freaking stupid.

02:14:24.100 --> 02:14:25.100
Oh jeez.

02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:26.100
Alright, what, wait.

02:14:26.100 --> 02:14:27.100
Place vote now, we'll get to your votes momentarily.

02:14:27.100 --> 02:14:28.100
What?

02:14:28.100 --> 02:14:30.820
Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico, and this is not from the onion, this is from

02:14:30.820 --> 02:14:31.820
Slashdot.

02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:35.820
Armed dolphins?

02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:39.820
Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico. Dolphins don't have arms.

02:14:39.820 --> 02:14:43.820
Finned dolphins?

02:14:43.820 --> 02:14:47.820
That sounds like the next Grand Theft Auto game to me.

02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:51.820
Are they ill-tempered? Taking the series where no one has dared take it before.

02:14:51.820 --> 02:14:55.820
Dolphins.

02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:59.820
I noticed my roommate Extrafur is here, so I want to give Extrafur a chance to say something on the show. Don't zone out on me.

02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:00.820
Hi.

02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:06.580
Well, no, actually, you know, we did a segment a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to bring back

02:15:06.580 --> 02:15:09.100
this segment, and that would be Extrovert's movie review.

02:15:09.100 --> 02:15:10.740
Oh, okay.

02:15:10.740 --> 02:15:15.660
Okay, so Extrovert, give us a movie review on Corpse Bride.

02:15:15.660 --> 02:15:18.340
Corpse Bride, it was pretty good.

02:15:18.340 --> 02:15:22.220
It was good watching excitement in the theater.

02:15:22.220 --> 02:15:23.220
Thank you for that review.

02:15:23.220 --> 02:15:24.220
Thumbs up?

02:15:24.220 --> 02:15:25.220
Thumbs down?

02:15:25.220 --> 02:15:26.940
It was nicely done.

02:15:26.940 --> 02:15:32.220
I liked The Nightmare Before Christmas better, but this one definitely had...

02:15:32.220 --> 02:15:33.220
It was more emotional.

02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:36.740
It was more, like, dramatic than The Nightmare Before Christmas.

02:15:36.740 --> 02:15:37.740
All right.

02:15:37.740 --> 02:15:39.780
So, anyways, that's my whole take on that.

02:15:39.780 --> 02:15:42.900
Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways, thumb up and ass.

02:15:42.900 --> 02:15:45.300
Thumbs diagonal ways.

02:15:45.300 --> 02:15:46.300
Thumbs diagonal ways.

02:15:46.300 --> 02:15:47.300
Yeah.

02:15:47.300 --> 02:15:48.300
Okay.

02:15:48.300 --> 02:15:49.300
Up.

02:15:49.300 --> 02:15:50.300
I don't know.

02:15:50.300 --> 02:15:51.300
I was starting to think of Margaret Cho's mother, her impression.

02:15:51.300 --> 02:15:54.300
OH MY BUDDY TO JUMP!

02:15:54.300 --> 02:15:57.300
Oh my buddy was jumping!

02:15:57.300 --> 02:15:58.300
All right.

02:15:58.300 --> 02:16:00.300
People were exploding in the theater.

02:16:00.300 --> 02:16:01.300
It was great.

02:16:01.300 --> 02:16:02.300
All right.

02:16:02.300 --> 02:16:03.300
Thank you extrovert for that.

02:16:03.300 --> 02:16:04.300
God blood on me.

02:16:04.300 --> 02:16:07.300
Now see, what movie are you going to see next week that you can review?

02:16:07.300 --> 02:16:13.300
Um, well, I'm going to see Serenity again, but I've already, like, talked that one up like crazy.

02:16:13.300 --> 02:16:16.300
So you're going to have to see two movies so you have something for us next Sunday.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:17.300
Okay.

02:16:17.300 --> 02:16:18.300
Don't let me down.

02:16:18.300 --> 02:16:19.300
Okay.

02:16:19.300 --> 02:16:20.300
Rent something on Netflix, DVD, I don't know.

02:16:20.300 --> 02:16:22.300
Find a movie and review it next week.

02:16:50.300 --> 02:16:57.180
I need to see that she's never seen it at all I've only seen the butchered one

02:16:57.180 --> 02:17:01.860
I've never seen the movie at all I've seen I've already seen it all the way

02:17:01.860 --> 02:17:06.780
through because I had a French copy of it a while back like is the uncut

02:17:06.780 --> 02:17:11.540
version does he have sex with her or something makes it so she kisses him oh

02:17:11.540 --> 02:17:19.300
okay it has more of the love story in it oh for those you guys in chat somebody's

02:17:19.300 --> 02:17:23.900
freaking out about serenity? Where? It's this Friday in the theaters.

02:17:23.900 --> 02:17:27.900
You can check out Yahoo.com enter in your zip code and you can find out like the rest of us.

02:17:27.900 --> 02:17:29.900
And it's really really really really really good.

02:17:29.900 --> 02:17:31.900
Because you saw a sneak preview, right?

02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:32.900
I did see a sneak preview.

02:17:32.900 --> 02:17:33.900
Good job.

02:17:33.900 --> 02:17:36.900
And it has all the hot mens in it, right?

02:17:36.900 --> 02:17:39.900
It has a few hot mens in it.

02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.900
Because I think the captain is hot.

02:17:41.900 --> 02:17:45.900
The captain is hot, so Simon is hot.

02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:48.900
when you're a professional movie reviewer like you are now on orange

02:17:48.900 --> 02:17:49.500

alright let's get through tonight's sim update they were going to give away some

02:18:13.540 --> 02:18:18.540
Sim update. Loki, what's going on in the Sim world?

02:18:18.540 --> 02:18:23.540
Well, I played more Food Mix 2, and it was good.

02:18:23.540 --> 02:18:30.540
Still nothing really too much else going on other than the release of Food Mix 2 last week.

02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:36.540
Really, I think Turning Mix 6 is over. I hope it is, because I'm over with it.

02:18:36.540 --> 02:18:43.260
And um, there's a new um, what was it, a new, there's another new file tournament coming

02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:44.260
up.

02:18:44.260 --> 02:18:45.540
Really, nothing going on.

02:18:45.540 --> 02:18:46.540
Nothing at all.

02:18:46.540 --> 02:18:49.840
Just played Food Mix 2 and waited out.

02:18:49.840 --> 02:18:52.580
You need to fill time with something because I'm tallying cage match votes here.

02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:53.580
Last call for cage match votes.

02:18:53.580 --> 02:19:03.020
Anyways, since I'm filling time, um, yeah I need some alcohol, no, um, well is it Reef

02:19:03.020 --> 02:19:15.020
The movie for Madison is awesome. It's so funny. It's got a lot of funny people. A lot of funny people.

02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:20.020
This is a Showtime thing. I actually want to see the stage play of it. It looks really neat.

02:19:20.020 --> 02:19:28.020
It's basically an anti-marijuana movie. Or was, supposedly. It's based off a 1930s propaganda film put out by the government.

02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:32.540
and uh... where basically people smoke pot and then they turn into zombies and kill people

02:19:32.540 --> 02:19:37.880
and like have sex and turn the whores and worship cities. That means we want to smoke pot.

02:19:37.880 --> 02:19:40.280
It's a great movie.

02:19:40.280 --> 02:19:43.840
Yes, so basically um...

02:19:43.840 --> 02:19:48.260
Stop it. Okay, basically has Alan Cummings, he's the main guy who's actually kind of like

02:19:48.260 --> 02:19:51.420
the government guy who's telling everybody about, you know,

02:19:51.420 --> 02:19:56.420
how reefer's bad. He was also in Josie and the Pussycats, mighty fine roll. The main

02:19:56.420 --> 02:20:01.920
It was played by Christian Campbell, which is Nev Campbell's brother, and Nev Campbell's also in it.

02:20:01.920 --> 02:20:05.920
He was in a movie called Trick, which you'd know about if you're a fag.

02:20:05.920 --> 02:20:13.920
Okay. Who else was in this? Oh, fellow SNL cast member Ana Gasteyer was in it.

02:20:13.920 --> 02:20:14.920
Okay.

02:20:14.920 --> 02:20:15.920
She was hilarious.

02:20:15.920 --> 02:20:19.920
Love her impersonation of Martha Stewart. Topless Halloween special.

02:20:19.920 --> 02:20:21.920
Christmas special.

02:20:21.920 --> 02:20:22.920
Whatever.

02:20:22.920 --> 02:20:30.920
It was pretty funny. I highly recommend it. It's coming out. It's going to be packaged with the actual 1930s movie as well, and it's really funny.

02:20:30.920 --> 02:20:32.920
Great. All right, thank you.

02:20:32.920 --> 02:20:33.920
Actually, I need to ask Axta for something.

02:20:33.920 --> 02:20:34.920
Okay.

02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:40.920
My friend in her live journal described Corpse Bride, and I want to see if you agree with her description.

02:20:40.920 --> 02:20:41.920
Okay.

02:20:41.920 --> 02:20:47.920
Corpse Bride was one of those nice heartwarming tales that touches you in all the wrong places.

02:20:47.920 --> 02:20:51.920
Well, I didn't feel physically touched by it.

02:20:51.920 --> 02:20:55.920
Show me on the doll where Corpse Bride touched you.

02:20:55.920 --> 02:20:59.920
It touched me in the pee-pee.

02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:03.920
It felt good.

02:21:03.920 --> 02:21:07.920
I'm not touching that!

02:21:07.920 --> 02:21:11.920
Okay, I think we need to save this show by giving something away! Yay! Let's give some shit away!

02:21:11.920 --> 02:21:15.920

02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:56.320
send that to the free stuff one. Now, if you didn't win, you guys, if you didn't win, don't

02:21:56.320 --> 02:22:00.440
worry because you are already entered because you're a live show listener. You actually

02:22:00.440 --> 02:22:03.760
get two shots at this. We're really kissing your ass because you take time on Sunday Nights

02:22:03.760 --> 02:22:08.400
to Listen to This. You automatically are entered into the drawing that we're going to do next

02:22:08.400 --> 02:22:13.760
Sunday, which our whole podcast now has opened up to. Please do not send another email. You're

02:22:13.760 --> 02:22:17.200
already in it. You don't have to send another one. So look forward to that.

02:22:17.200 --> 02:22:20.960
We'll disqualify you. All right. So sorry to those of you who didn't

02:22:20.960 --> 02:22:25.280
win, but you have a second chance. You have a second chance. So we'll do that next week.

02:22:25.280 --> 02:22:32.440
So congratulations, Fireboma, who apparently left chat and went to bed. Good job. Fireboma.

02:22:32.440 --> 02:22:36.720
I think that disqualifies him. No, we can't disqualify him. He won fair and

02:22:36.720 --> 02:22:42.780
square. He won. Bastard. Leaving and going to sleep. All right. Who needs sleep? Sleep

02:22:42.780 --> 02:22:47.700
is for weenies. All right. And some folks in chat say they want the max 2 v-rare still

02:22:47.700 --> 02:22:52.100
very bad and they heard me slip up earlier and say that we actually have three max 2

02:22:52.100 --> 02:22:59.100
v-rares and two EX2s. So we will find a way to give those away. Absolutely. Maybe a bonus?

02:22:59.100 --> 02:23:03.500
Maybe. We'll see. We'll see. We might give away a bonus or something. Well congratulations

02:23:03.500 --> 02:23:10.220
to narcoleptic fire Obama who won I see how it is you enter the contest and

02:23:10.220 --> 02:23:13.620
leave us somebody should send him a copy of this show where we're just razzing on

02:23:13.620 --> 02:23:16.860
him for not being here how dare sleep be more important than

02:23:16.860 --> 02:23:20.340
orange or Lauren's lunch that's not the people who leave us to go watch Family

02:23:20.340 --> 02:23:25.420
Guy dude Family Guy this season has not been funny I don't think great I don't

02:23:25.420 --> 02:23:28.940
know if we have we been watching the same show Family Guy is a great show

02:23:28.940 --> 02:23:32.460
don't get me wrong but the last two episodes this season have been stupid

02:23:32.460 --> 02:23:34.460
They have been absolutely stupid.

02:23:34.460 --> 02:23:36.460
I loved the last episode. That was great.

02:23:36.460 --> 02:23:39.460
One more day and I would have jumped your bones.

02:23:39.460 --> 02:23:46.460
I got linked to a disturbing TV Tokyo page for an anime called Ice Shield 21.

02:23:46.460 --> 02:23:49.460
It's about American football.

02:23:49.460 --> 02:23:50.460
Huh.

02:23:50.460 --> 02:23:53.460
I find that hilarious and I oddly want to see it.

02:23:53.460 --> 02:23:55.460
Hmm.

02:23:55.460 --> 02:23:58.460
Alright, we're going to go to a break. We're going to do just some random music this break.

02:23:58.460 --> 02:24:03.260
this break we don't really have a whole lot a big theme to this break but I want

02:24:03.260 --> 02:24:06.100
to play some Vincent D'amore so I know I'm putting that in there we're gonna

02:24:06.100 --> 02:24:09.640

02:24:09.640 --> 02:24:14.860
details on our next contest which you can enter starting tonight we are gonna

02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:19.140

02:24:19.140 --> 02:24:23.740

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:33.360
back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:56.360 --> 02:24:58.360
Oh

02:25:56.360 --> 02:25:58.360
Oh

02:26:26.360 --> 02:26:28.360

02:28:55.100 --> 02:28:55.600
Uh

02:29:25.100 --> 02:29:32.120
You know the way you and I gotta be

02:29:32.120 --> 02:29:34.120
You and I gotta be

02:31:32.120 --> 02:31:35.400
I'm the main ju maker guy

02:31:36.060 --> 02:31:38.520
I said that I am the chill

02:31:38.520 --> 02:31:41.320
I am the main ju maker guy

02:31:41.720 --> 02:31:45.300
Well, hello, hello, hello, hello, I am the chill

02:31:45.360 --> 02:31:48.180
I am the main ju maker guy

02:31:49.540 --> 02:31:51.740
I said that I am the chill

02:31:51.740 --> 02:31:56.200
I am the main ju maker guy

02:31:58.760 --> 02:32:00.940
Mr. Random person on the street who by the way

02:32:00.940 --> 02:32:04.940
is not an actor. What do you think of the Orange Lounge Baymani Music & More show?

02:32:04.940 --> 02:32:14.940
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly.

02:32:14.940 --> 02:32:18.940
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

02:32:18.940 --> 02:32:25.940
Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are, another show almost to a close.

02:32:25.940 --> 02:32:32.060
a good half hour of show left and we got still the FUs to get to and all sorts of other stuff

02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:40.940
as well. First off though, what I wanted to do, I was gonna, oh man, I was trying to find

02:32:40.940 --> 02:32:51.820
this sound file I had. If you're doing what I think you're doing, you can just stop it.

02:32:51.820 --> 02:32:52.820
Stop it!

02:32:52.820 --> 02:32:55.820
I don't know where it went, I'm so sad.

02:32:55.820 --> 02:32:58.260
Oh, darn, darn.

02:32:58.260 --> 02:33:02.940
I only have the version where it goes, hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex, and

02:33:02.940 --> 02:33:03.940
it's so much fun.

02:33:03.940 --> 02:33:07.060
But anyway, no, what happened during the break, it was really funny, I guess you had to be

02:33:07.060 --> 02:33:11.840
there, but Extrofer asked Jamie, asked DarkSakura, how's World of Warcraft going?

02:33:11.840 --> 02:33:14.580
And Jamie goes, it's so much fun.

02:33:14.580 --> 02:33:18.020
And then we all started giggling, and Loki's like, shut up.

02:33:18.020 --> 02:33:21.540
I was being serious, it really is a lot of fun.

02:33:21.540 --> 02:33:26.620
but it's really funny. It's a lot better than Final Fantasy XI ever was. Ah, shut your piehole.

02:33:26.620 --> 02:33:31.020
Alright. You've never played this. You don't know. I've seen it. You don't have to party with stupid people.

02:33:31.020 --> 02:33:35.740
I don't trash on World of Warcraft though. I think it's okay. I just, you know, I'm

02:33:35.740 --> 02:33:39.900
obsessed with it. Well, no, no, no, no, no, because I'm very bitter toward Final Fantasy XI because of the

02:33:39.900 --> 02:33:46.540
idiots. But, okay, it's like, hi, I'm gonna give you warning before I decide to buff everybody

02:33:46.540 --> 02:33:51.380
and I'm half tempted that if, you know, I give you a 20 second delay to get there

02:33:51.380 --> 02:33:57.880
before I cast the shit, and if they're not there, screw it, no haste for you.

02:33:57.880 --> 02:33:58.880
You done?

02:33:58.880 --> 02:33:59.880
Feel better?

02:33:59.880 --> 02:34:00.880
No.

02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:02.500
They make white mages bitches in that game.

02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:07.140
We're gonna go from one, um, we're gonna go from one rant to another.

02:34:07.140 --> 02:34:10.740
Uh, In the Groove, we have completely defaced this copy of In the Groove, extra for you

02:34:10.740 --> 02:34:12.740
actually need to add something to this too.

02:34:12.740 --> 02:34:13.740
Inside now.

02:34:13.740 --> 02:34:14.740
This has been defaced, huh?

02:34:14.740 --> 02:34:16.740
Doesn't he really need to add something?

02:34:16.740 --> 02:34:19.780
There's just a name or something, so that all sorts of Orange Lounge personalities are

02:34:19.780 --> 02:34:20.780

defaced this copy. Things just written all over this. This game sucks monkey

02:34:30.740 --> 02:34:36.140
balls. Actually, Loki signed it at least twice. I don't know why that is. DarkSakura

02:34:36.140 --> 02:34:39.400
drew an artistic interpretation in the middle. We wrote all over the

02:34:39.400 --> 02:34:42.380
instruction manual. We are going to be giving this away to a lucky listener.

02:34:42.380 --> 02:34:48.180

02:35:20.580 --> 02:35:26.380
second line must be seven syllables and your last line must be three ah so

02:35:26.380 --> 02:35:32.500

02:37:35.940 --> 02:37:43.060
so it's time to do the FUs of the week. The FUs of the week and huh? Oh, you

02:37:43.060 --> 02:37:45.340
want to know the cage match winner? I suppose we should do that as well, shouldn't we?

02:37:45.340 --> 02:37:52.860
Oh, I always forget to do the cage match winner. Tonight's cage match winner was

02:37:52.860 --> 02:37:59.340
kind of a landslide. Shouldn't be a surprise with this crowd that V by

02:37:59.340 --> 02:38:07.340
Dorsaria wins tonight's cage match because you guys are whores for V. Tools, all of you.

02:38:07.340 --> 02:38:19.220
Sheep. You're all a bunch of sheep. Alright, so Dorisia goes into rotation all week long

02:38:19.220 --> 02:38:22.820
and the two of us, DarkSakura and I, have to come up with something new for next week,

02:38:22.820 --> 02:38:26.620
so we'll see. Alright, let's get into the FUs of the Week. DarkSakura, why is it that

02:38:26.620 --> 02:38:30.060
have to do the FUs of the Week every single week and send yours in over private message

02:38:30.060 --> 02:38:44.060
right now if you want yours read. Because of Loki's vMix. That's my week. A big FU just

02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:49.940
being stuck by myself while my man's off in Texas. I wish my job would send me to Texas

02:38:49.940 --> 02:38:58.380
randomly. Um, so that I'm like, you know, not anywhere near California. Um, SU goes

02:38:58.380 --> 02:39:04.380
to jury duty sort of halfway because I actually wanted to go so that I could sleep in about

02:39:04.380 --> 02:39:09.500
two hours more than normal. And, uh, no, I have to go to work and then check back at

02:39:09.500 --> 02:39:15.660
11 to see if I have to go. I get to go the week after. Good for you. I bet you feel special.

02:39:15.660 --> 02:39:20.100
I hate it, but I want to get put on like a really interesting case or

02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:25.820
Like one that has like a lot of forensic evidence for me to mull over to stuff like that interests me

02:39:25.900 --> 02:39:29.700
Or like real estate stuff because I actually studied real estate law

02:39:29.700 --> 02:39:33.500
So I know what to do with that or mortgage law because that would totally be me

02:39:34.980 --> 02:39:38.380
But I don't want to be I don't even mind having a serial murder case

02:39:38.840 --> 02:39:43.580
Because serial murderers have like specific criteria they look for in their victims

02:39:43.580 --> 02:39:47.320
But if it's like some really rich and powerful person, I don't want to do that because then

02:39:47.320 --> 02:39:52.140
they hunt down the jury, or they're convicted for being morons.

02:39:52.140 --> 02:39:54.260
I really want to nail a stupid person, though.

02:39:54.260 --> 02:39:58.420
I want to be on the jury for someone who did something really stupid, because they go,

02:39:58.420 --> 02:40:00.420
ah, you're stupid, guilty.

02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:08.740
Um, F.U. to, uh, and I hate saying F.U. to my man because I love him so much, but after

02:40:08.740 --> 02:40:16.380
me being so lonely and missing him so much, he comes home and wakes my ass up by banging

02:40:16.380 --> 02:40:20.900
on the metal door and then fusses at me, accusing me of not doing the dishes, which I did the

02:40:20.900 --> 02:40:26.340
dishes three times while he was gone, okay, and then, just because I had company last

02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:32.620
night, and then, and then, I'm, you know, doing homework, and he, no, he says he's taking

02:40:32.620 --> 02:40:37.060
a shower, so I start doing my homework, and then he's gone, I don't know where he is,

02:40:37.060 --> 02:40:39.260
So I finished my homework, I played with my puppies.

02:40:39.260 --> 02:40:41.420
I get started on working on another project,

02:40:41.420 --> 02:40:42.260
and then he comes up and says,

02:40:42.260 --> 02:40:44.340
oh yeah, I told you I was going across the street.

02:40:44.340 --> 02:40:45.260
No, you didn't!

02:40:45.260 --> 02:40:48.060
And if you did, you need to make sure that I heard you.

02:40:48.060 --> 02:40:50.380
And then he says, you would come play Madden with us.

02:40:50.380 --> 02:40:53.480
And I hate American football more than anything,

02:40:53.480 --> 02:40:55.380
just about, except for idiots,

02:40:55.380 --> 02:40:58.020
because most of the time it really is,

02:40:58.020 --> 02:41:02.160
I think a football, and I think a big, fat, ugly,

02:41:02.160 --> 02:41:05.360
buttooth rednecks, you know, the stereotypical redneck,

02:41:05.360 --> 02:41:11.040
drinking a beer, you know, drinking a bud or a Coors, something nasty, you know, in

02:41:11.040 --> 02:41:17.940
a wife beater and, you know, torn up jeans or shorts or like boxers or something. I have

02:41:17.940 --> 02:41:22.600
this mental image because I have actually seen it multiple times in different places,

02:41:22.600 --> 02:41:30.600
usually in Mississippi. Um, so yeah, I, I can't, I was so mad. And then I come here

02:41:30.600 --> 02:41:33.600
And then I still don't have my game.

02:41:36.600 --> 02:41:37.600
Which irks me.

02:41:37.600 --> 02:41:38.600
The K game.

02:41:38.600 --> 02:41:39.600
The K game.

02:41:39.600 --> 02:41:40.600
Kalamari.

02:41:40.600 --> 02:41:43.600
Na na na na na na na.

02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:44.600
Reee!

02:41:44.600 --> 02:41:46.600
Dot dot dot.

02:41:46.600 --> 02:41:52.600
And then, and then I really want, uh, Dirge of, uh, Cerberus delayed.

02:41:52.600 --> 02:41:54.600
The beta test got delayed.

02:41:54.600 --> 02:41:56.600
So that means it's gonna be delayed even more.

02:41:56.600 --> 02:41:59.600
And I don't really give a crap about online content because I want Vincent Eye Candy.

02:41:59.600 --> 02:42:02.600
candy. The end.

02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:34.880
turn on a four-way stop and I go through there and dumb old guy slows down

02:42:34.880 --> 02:42:39.800
briefly and then goes nearly like rear-ending my car so then I'm pulling

02:42:39.800 --> 02:42:44.840
up to the stop the next stop sign which is a two you know a three-way stop and

02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:49.240
dumbass pulls up next to me there is no other lane there's only one lane and he's

02:42:49.240 --> 02:42:54.280
trying to create his own lane and so I go and he goes right next to me thus

02:42:54.280 --> 02:42:58.600
creating his own lane I guess because he's old and stupid his car sucked so

02:42:58.600 --> 02:43:03.960
So fuck you to old people because you can't drive and you need to be off the road.

02:43:03.960 --> 02:43:06.320
And you're not the only old person that's done this.

02:43:06.320 --> 02:43:09.380
There are other old people that drive too slow, other old people that don't look at

02:43:09.380 --> 02:43:10.520
where they're going.

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:15.620
Whenever I see a car on the road, it's of one of a couple criteria.

02:43:15.620 --> 02:43:19.640
Woman or old person or an old woman, which is the worst.

02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:21.820
The bigger the hair, the slower they drive.

02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:25.940
So yeah.

02:43:25.940 --> 02:43:30.340
I do have to say that there was a guy probably about in his early twenties.

02:43:30.340 --> 02:43:34.300
There's this one intersection by Red Robin going on sunrise for anyone who lives in the

02:43:34.300 --> 02:43:35.240
area

02:43:35.240 --> 02:43:39.240
where you have two left turn lanes, you know, one of them turns right and can go

02:43:39.240 --> 02:43:40.500
straight to

02:43:40.500 --> 02:43:42.620
and then there's actually

02:43:42.620 --> 02:43:44.420
two

02:43:44.420 --> 02:43:46.500
left lanes.

02:43:46.500 --> 02:43:52.620
Well the guy pulls into the opposite traffic lane as a turn lane

02:43:52.620 --> 02:43:57.620
And we roll down the window and go, um, hey, you, over here, and he's like driving like a Camaro.

02:43:58.620 --> 02:43:59.620
My favorite...

02:44:00.620 --> 02:44:01.620
It was no bitchin' Camaro.

02:44:02.620 --> 02:44:03.620
It was a guy.

02:44:04.620 --> 02:44:11.620
My favorite, though, is the guy that said, you know, pull up, we're in the left turn lane, okay, there's only a left turn lane, and, you know, a lane that goes straight and right.

02:44:12.620 --> 02:44:19.620
And this guy pulls up into oncoming traffic, goes to the left of the left turn lane, and makes a left turn, all when the light's just green to go straight.

02:44:19.620 --> 02:44:25.620
It's like, holy crap, you just completely ignored every single traffic law right there.

02:44:25.620 --> 02:44:30.620
I had another lady today in her van pull straight through the red, um, through the stop sign.

02:44:30.620 --> 02:44:34.620
Just didn't even slow down, just went 50 miles an hour through the stop sign.

02:44:34.620 --> 02:44:36.620
Three hour show, Loki.

02:44:39.620 --> 02:44:46.620
Okay, Rob, I'm going to talk really fast then.

02:44:46.620 --> 02:44:53.620
so my other F U was to screaming kids in the movie last night. The end.

02:45:16.620 --> 02:45:26.620
FU to Loki for being a jackass, FU to Renee in chatroom for calling me a liar. I hope your copy of EX2 is scratched and doesn't work. Just kidding, heart.

02:45:26.620 --> 02:45:38.620
FU to this pink thing that I have on my desk. I don't even know what it is, but I always want to play with it. I don't know why.

02:45:38.620 --> 02:45:41.620
You know how they have training wheels? That's a training cock ring.

02:45:41.620 --> 02:45:45.620
No, this is not a training cock ring, and this would never fit.

02:45:45.620 --> 02:45:47.620
This is, it was on a CD spindle, I think.

02:45:47.620 --> 02:45:48.620
That's why it's so small.

02:45:48.620 --> 02:45:51.620
That's what it is, and I can't stop playing with it, it's smooshy.

02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:55.620
I should send this to a contest winner, so it's out of my house.

02:45:55.620 --> 02:45:57.620
Maybe I'll do that.

02:45:57.620 --> 02:45:58.620
You can play with this, too.

02:45:58.620 --> 02:46:04.620
My finger's been in this hole, I don't know how many times.

02:46:04.620 --> 02:46:05.620
Do you want to sign it?

02:46:05.620 --> 02:46:06.620
I have sharpies.

02:46:06.620 --> 02:46:11.620
Somebody's going to cut that little clip of the show and make a YTMND out of it.

02:46:11.620 --> 02:46:15.620
Yeah, low-key.

02:46:15.620 --> 02:46:18.620
I should send that to a random listener.

02:46:18.620 --> 02:46:23.620
Anyway, let's see, what else do I have in FU?

02:46:23.620 --> 02:46:28.620
I'm not going to sign it and give it away. It's my pink thing. The listeners can get their own pink thing.

02:46:28.620 --> 02:46:31.620
I bet you many of them do.

02:46:31.620 --> 02:46:36.220

i don't want to clean

02:46:43.580 --> 02:46:45.080
cleaning sucks

02:46:45.080 --> 02:46:47.640
i want a robot the cleans for me

02:46:47.640 --> 02:46:50.120

02:46:58.220 --> 02:47:00.940

at the tide house for a birthday party.

02:47:13.300 --> 02:47:17.100
Second F.U. to maximum tune at UC Davis for

02:47:17.100 --> 02:47:20.780
gleefully accepting my card and then telling me, hey, drop three more bucks

02:47:20.780 --> 02:47:26.260
and we'll import your card data to another card that'll work with our machine.

02:47:26.260 --> 02:47:28.380
Yeah, right.

02:47:28.380 --> 02:47:31.940
And a F.U. for Netflix for not working damn faster.

02:47:31.940 --> 02:47:36.940
I want that movie the next fucking day, not the day after.

02:47:36.940 --> 02:47:39.220
Use wormholes or some shit like that.

02:47:39.220 --> 02:47:41.700
That's it.

02:47:41.700 --> 02:47:43.100
Alright.

02:47:43.100 --> 02:47:44.260
Garrett.

02:47:44.260 --> 02:47:51.380
Um, an F.U. to eBears who sell forged autographs on items.

02:47:51.380 --> 02:47:55.380
Oh, that was short and sweet.

02:47:55.380 --> 02:47:56.380
Extrovert.

02:47:56.380 --> 02:48:03.380
Um, f you to guys that say the exact wrong thing during sex.

02:48:04.380 --> 02:48:10.380
Okay. Okay, you want the story? Okay then, Xtifer.

02:48:10.380 --> 02:48:17.380
Sure, Xtifer. Tell us all about your sex, or I'm sorry, of sex that your friend had.

02:48:17.380 --> 02:48:24.080
Well, we were busy having sex, and he says- Oh, look at that! Look at that! We just lost

02:48:24.080 --> 02:48:29.080
Oh, oh, no problem. No, I'm still talking.

02:48:29.080 --> 02:48:34.080
I'm sorry, I forgot this was the extrovert show. My bad.

02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:42.080
Well, thanks for remembering. No, so basically he stops as we're into it and he says something like,

02:48:42.080 --> 02:48:47.080
yeah, so I'm not in the mood for getting into a relationship right now.

02:48:47.080 --> 02:48:52.080
And I looked at him and I said, why are you going to say something stupid like that while we're having sex?

02:48:52.080 --> 02:48:54.280
I'm like, sex is stupid.

02:48:54.280 --> 02:48:56.000
You don't have a brain when you're having sex.

02:48:56.000 --> 02:48:57.220
You don't think.

02:48:57.220 --> 02:48:59.160
You don't say things that you think of.

02:48:59.160 --> 02:49:00.460
I'm like, unless they're dirty.

02:49:00.460 --> 02:49:01.460
You say dirty things.

02:49:01.460 --> 02:49:03.600
I mean, I can think of very many dirty things.

02:49:03.600 --> 02:49:06.600
I can probably say a bunch of them right now if I wanted to.

02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:07.600
Sure, why not?

02:49:07.600 --> 02:49:08.600
Yes.

02:49:08.600 --> 02:49:09.600
Dishes.

02:49:09.600 --> 02:49:10.600
Sure, give us an example.

02:49:10.600 --> 02:49:11.600
Why not?

02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:12.600
The listeners are already scared as it is.

02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:17.360
You know, like the normals, suck my cock, you know, stick your tongue up my ass, you

02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:19.840
know, stuff like that.

02:49:19.840 --> 02:49:26.020
But you know, you don't want to say something that's actually, you know, somewhat conversation,

02:49:26.020 --> 02:49:28.160
you know, starting.

02:49:28.160 --> 02:49:32.760
I got limp, okay?

02:49:32.760 --> 02:49:38.840
It's very difficult for me to talk about something like that during sex, and so I, you know,

02:49:38.840 --> 02:49:44.840
fuck you to that, to him.

02:49:44.840 --> 02:49:47.640

02:53:33.040 --> 02:53:40.360
people are angsty as hell tonight. Alright. So, um, there it is. Your FUs of the Week.

02:53:40.360 --> 02:53:43.680
Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio. Loki, what's on your mind?

02:53:43.680 --> 02:53:50.240
Um, I'm tired of the cheese. I kind of want to eat the rest of it, but it's getting even

02:53:50.240 --> 02:53:55.480
harder. And, uh, but there's not much left. You remember how much it came in with? That

02:53:55.480 --> 02:54:00.120
is all that's left. Did you have to hold brick when you came in here? I had half of it. Are

02:54:00.120 --> 02:54:03.120
Are you worried about having a heart bypass when you're 30?

02:54:03.120 --> 02:54:04.120
No?

02:54:04.120 --> 02:54:05.120
Just curious.

02:54:05.120 --> 02:54:07.120
Are you 25 yet?

02:54:07.120 --> 02:54:08.120
Yes.

02:54:08.120 --> 02:54:10.880
Okay, then you don't have to wait until 25 for that.

02:54:10.880 --> 02:54:12.440
He just turned 25 a few.

02:54:12.440 --> 02:54:13.440
That's right, last week.

02:54:13.440 --> 02:54:15.840
His birthday is September 11th, so.

02:54:15.840 --> 02:54:16.840
Lucky guy.

02:54:16.840 --> 02:54:19.560
All right, well, damn, I'm out of topics.

02:54:19.560 --> 02:54:21.280
Let me scan.

02:54:21.280 --> 02:54:23.280
I'm sure I missed something here on orangelaundryradio.com.

02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:26.580
Give me a moment here.

02:54:26.580 --> 02:54:27.580
Ask Orange Laundry.

02:54:27.580 --> 02:54:28.580
We only have five minutes left.

02:54:28.580 --> 02:54:31.580
Okay, if we get a couple quick questions, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:54:31.580 --> 02:54:34.580
Hurry up and send a question over to orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

02:54:34.580 --> 02:54:37.580
Oh, I wanted to add this. I guess we can throw this out there.

02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:41.580
We have a MySpace now. I guess we can promote this, right? Why not?

02:54:41.580 --> 02:54:43.580
Yeah, I was going to do it.

02:54:43.580 --> 02:54:46.580
Well, Terry's going to turn it over to you, right? Or something. He said he would.

02:54:46.580 --> 02:54:50.580
So, we are actually discontinuing.

02:54:50.580 --> 02:54:54.580
For those of you guys that are in our 1UP Club, due to lack of activity

02:54:54.580 --> 02:54:58.200
the fact that we're going to actually be leaving, or at least I'm going to be leaving my blog

02:54:58.200 --> 02:55:00.900
on 1up.com for another project pretty soon.

02:55:00.900 --> 02:55:04.180
No disrespect to the folks there, but we're going to discontinue our club there.

02:55:04.180 --> 02:55:05.180
I never used mine.

02:55:05.180 --> 02:55:07.780
Yeah, so we're discontinuing our club at 1up.com.

02:55:07.780 --> 02:55:11.100
Instead, now we have a MySpace.

02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:15.920
And MySpace I know we've joked about sometimes is where the internet goes to die, because

02:55:15.920 --> 02:55:17.120
in some ways it is.

02:55:17.120 --> 02:55:18.880
It is.

02:55:18.880 --> 02:55:21.820
And why is it the place where the internet goes to die?

02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:23.660
Your sister's MySpace.

02:55:23.660 --> 02:55:26.940
My sister's Myspace is god awful, it is.

02:55:26.940 --> 02:55:27.940
That is a very good example.

02:55:27.940 --> 02:55:34.420
She has like little pictures of Satan like spinning around and stuff.

02:55:34.420 --> 02:55:40.740
But yeah, anyway, we actually have a brand new club on Myspace.

02:55:40.740 --> 02:55:42.020
I'm just trying to find the URL.

02:55:42.020 --> 02:55:46.300
I think it's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge, but I'm just kind of trying to make sure of

02:55:46.300 --> 02:55:47.300
that here.

02:55:47.300 --> 02:55:48.300
Shoot.

02:55:48.300 --> 02:55:50.300
There we go.

02:55:50.300 --> 02:55:56.420
There we go, yes, it's groups.myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, so if you're a Myspace

02:55:56.420 --> 02:56:00.680
whore, like the rest of us, you can actually join our club on Myspace.

02:56:00.680 --> 02:56:05.700
And I don't know what we're going to do with the Myspace club, but we'll do clubby things.

02:56:05.700 --> 02:56:06.700
Okay?

02:56:06.700 --> 02:56:07.700
Like baby seal clubs?

02:56:07.700 --> 02:56:14.220
Yeah, we'll go and drink a lot and listen to Blur, and you said club things.

02:56:14.220 --> 02:56:15.220
Yeah, I know.

02:56:15.220 --> 02:56:17.220
I like the baby seal clubs.

02:56:17.220 --> 02:56:19.420
We'll club you, actually, if you join this club.

02:56:19.420 --> 02:56:24.420
Oh, cool. Well, maybe do a special giveaway for the club or something, but we want to have a MySpace page.

02:56:24.420 --> 02:56:32.420
Actually, something we thought about is maybe we actually should have an actual artist page so we can put songs on it, and it could be clips of the show or something.

02:56:32.420 --> 02:56:35.420
So we thought about doing that, too. So maybe Dark Soccer, you can work on that one.

02:56:35.420 --> 02:56:36.420
It's so cool.

02:56:36.420 --> 02:56:37.420
Work on that end of it.

02:56:37.420 --> 02:56:38.420
Maybe.

02:56:38.420 --> 02:56:39.420
Maybe.

02:56:39.420 --> 02:56:42.420
And, of course, I have my Loki Fusion page on MySpace.

02:56:42.420 --> 02:56:44.420
Yes, you do. Hoard that out, because it's been a little while.

02:56:44.420 --> 02:56:48.420
uh... myspace dot com slash lowkey fusion and uh...

02:56:48.420 --> 02:56:51.900
i need to add some more stuff to it. I have a couple songs on there

02:56:51.900 --> 02:56:54.900
but some stuff that you might not be able to find or you know

02:56:54.900 --> 02:56:58.500
because a lot of my mp3's are out there but it's hard to find now so

02:56:58.500 --> 02:57:00.860
they're up there, some of them

02:57:00.860 --> 02:57:03.700
alright we're actually getting some questions for ask orange lounge we don't

02:57:03.700 --> 02:57:06.540
have much time left in the show so we're gonna go ahead and get into these

02:57:06.540 --> 02:57:07.700
questions

02:57:07.700 --> 02:57:14.700
uh... so we can wrap this shit up

02:57:17.900 --> 02:57:19.660
let's ask orange lounge

02:57:19.660 --> 02:57:21.300
some stupid question

02:57:21.300 --> 02:57:25.940
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio i hope if you had a

02:57:25.940 --> 02:57:30.860
question you already sent it in because i'm cutting the rest of you off because

02:57:30.860 --> 02:57:32.740
we're going to be overtime

02:57:32.740 --> 02:57:35.620
alright uh...

02:57:35.620 --> 02:57:45.320
Renee, first, just a quick comment. The Ultramix 3 song pack medley sounds like what you'd hear in different phases of a climatic final boss fight.

02:57:45.320 --> 02:57:52.720
Now my question, what do you all believe is the mystery track after what's supposedly after the 250 BPM remix?

02:57:52.720 --> 02:57:58.020
I honestly have no idea. I've listened to that thing and I just, I don't, I don't know.

02:57:58.020 --> 02:58:02.620
strong jaeger i could probably ask somebody and probably find out but i

02:58:02.620 --> 02:58:06.100
don't think that they'd appreciate me sharing that information right now so

02:58:06.100 --> 02:58:07.540
it was a strong jaeger

02:58:07.540 --> 02:58:11.140
or uh... i think it's something that i think it's something l-e-d maybe it's

02:58:11.140 --> 02:58:15.220
like big voyager

02:58:15.220 --> 02:58:18.420
you heard garrett says he's heard strong he stirred up a strong anger in there

02:58:18.420 --> 02:58:20.660
definitely

02:58:20.660 --> 02:58:23.800
i thought you guys said vinj and jae was in there and i thought they were like

02:58:23.800 --> 02:58:26.340
mashing it all up with something else but i thought i heard the bass from that and that

02:58:26.340 --> 02:58:40.340
I thought the two things that were in there were, because someone was saying there's five tracks, and it was 250 BPM, being from Denjin J, Love Me Do, Outer Limits, and then another remix of Love Me Do was my guess. Not in exactly that order.

02:58:40.340 --> 02:58:55.340
Alright. Well, we'll see. Anyway, we gotta get to some other questions here. Rene's second question. What would you do for a Klondike bar? Eat it. No, what would you do for a Klondike bar? You can't eat it until you've done something for it.

02:58:55.340 --> 02:58:57.340
I would eat another Klondike bar.

02:58:57.340 --> 02:58:59.340
Um, I wouldn't eat a Klondike bar.

02:58:59.340 --> 02:59:01.340
Me either.

02:59:01.340 --> 02:59:05.340
That's it, I gotta go buy Klondike bars now, thank you very much.

02:59:05.340 --> 02:59:10.340
Legend of Zaku says, I have an LCD TV now, I need some cool shit to do with it.

02:59:10.340 --> 02:59:11.340
Um...

02:59:11.340 --> 02:59:12.340
Kill it!

02:59:12.340 --> 02:59:13.340
Give it to me!

02:59:13.340 --> 02:59:15.340
Lower it and put a spoiler on it.

02:59:15.340 --> 02:59:17.340
Play Atari 2600 on it.

02:59:17.340 --> 02:59:23.340
Sakurina says, what does the Poppin' Music whore think of the new Bomani logo on Poppin' 13?

02:59:23.340 --> 02:59:29.340
I have no idea, really. I don't know. I think the interface looks like shit in Pop Music 13.

02:59:29.340 --> 02:59:35.340
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, why do you like to deprive us easterners of sleep?

02:59:35.340 --> 02:59:37.340
That's your own fucking fault.

02:59:37.340 --> 02:59:39.340
In all seriousness...

02:59:39.340 --> 02:59:42.340
Why do they like to deprive us of our morning here?

02:59:42.340 --> 02:59:48.340
Yeah, if we did the show any earlier, we'd be cutting into the rest of our weekends, so we really can't.

02:59:48.340 --> 02:59:51.220
uh... e there's just

02:59:51.220 --> 02:59:55.420
you're screwed i'm sorry i i really wish i had some better news for you but uh...

02:59:55.420 --> 02:59:59.700
now there you know it's great there's actually a way

02:59:59.700 --> 03:00:02.420
and you can actually they have like a thing for streaming media worth like

03:00:02.420 --> 03:00:02.980
you know

03:00:02.980 --> 03:00:06.780
kit yet he wrote a show figure waited i'm sure somebody like

03:00:06.780 --> 03:00:10.020
so they are chat room that knows about those things like john fields goes on i

03:00:10.020 --> 03:00:12.460
think you know something about that

03:00:12.460 --> 03:00:15.900
every white misty at the military lines are available

03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:19.140
I'm not sure when they do own on freak. Yeah on Fridays

03:00:20.940 --> 03:00:28.400
Nintendo maniac 64 also wants to know why doesn't my Numa mp3 work in wmp. It doesn't want to play that song because it's horde

03:00:29.900 --> 03:00:34.900
I'm assuming that's wmp. I'm one I'm saying that's Numa Numa a probably. I don't know

03:00:36.580 --> 03:00:43.500
John Field says given your recent issues with show timing are there any considerations of expanding the show another half an hour to an hour?

03:00:43.500 --> 03:00:50.060
Only if you'd like to wake up and do my job for me in the morning?

03:00:50.060 --> 03:00:54.260
I don't know if that's... he might be talking about Orange Lounge to Go, because Orange

03:00:54.260 --> 03:00:58.720
Lounge to Go is supposed to be 30 minutes, but it's been going an hour. Orange Lounge

03:00:58.720 --> 03:01:04.000
to Go goes however long we feel like, basically. But this one, no. No way.

03:01:04.000 --> 03:01:07.640
This particular show, no, because we taped the podcast right after this show, so there's

03:01:07.640 --> 03:01:10.680
no way we could expand the show. In fact, if anything, we'd want to cut back this show

03:01:10.680 --> 03:01:16.680
to make our podcast longer, but we're not going to do that at any time soon. No plans

03:01:16.680 --> 03:01:25.680
at this time. Tomokun says, Blu-ray or HD DVD? I want them both to come up with something

03:01:25.680 --> 03:01:30.440
that's standard, so both work, because I don't want to buy two players, period. That's it.

03:01:30.440 --> 03:01:31.840
You don't have to.

03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:32.840
What?

03:01:32.840 --> 03:01:33.840
JGB is making one of both.

03:01:33.840 --> 03:01:40.000
Good. And lastly, Illusion wants to ask, where's Waldo?

03:01:40.000 --> 03:01:49.400
Quebec having sex with extra fur I don't know I mean in a bunker in Iraq that's

03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:55.520
the end of the show boys and girls final thought time extra for your final

03:01:55.520 --> 03:02:03.680
thought why is it gonna be me Garrett your final five Garrett I don't have a

03:02:03.680 --> 03:02:06.240
final thought I'm thoughtless thanks for coming

03:02:06.240 --> 03:02:08.240
He was.

03:02:08.240 --> 03:02:10.240
That's not what he said.

03:02:10.240 --> 03:02:12.240
He didn't say things for coffee.

03:02:12.240 --> 03:02:14.240
Buggs, your final thought?

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:16.240
Because it's Quebec.

03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:18.240
Loki, your final thought?

03:02:18.240 --> 03:02:20.240
I forgot to mention this earlier, but

03:02:20.240 --> 03:02:24.240
fuck you to McDonald's for making shoddy cuffs that break open in my car.

03:02:24.240 --> 03:02:26.240
Every time.

03:02:26.240 --> 03:02:30.240
And my final thought is, um...

03:02:30.240 --> 03:02:32.240
I still don't want to clean.

03:02:32.240 --> 03:02:34.240
DarkSakura, your final thought?

03:02:34.240 --> 03:02:39.740
Um, I want pancakes and reject false icons.

03:02:39.740 --> 03:02:41.740
We need to go to Country Waffles.

03:02:41.740 --> 03:02:43.240
I had Country Waffles today.

03:02:43.240 --> 03:02:45.240
I have to have pancakes on a cheat day.

03:02:45.240 --> 03:02:46.740
I went to Country Waffles today.

03:02:46.740 --> 03:02:47.740
I hate you.

03:02:47.740 --> 03:02:48.240
I love waffles.

03:02:48.240 --> 03:02:49.740
I want a peanut butter banana waffle so bad.

03:02:49.740 --> 03:02:51.740
I can have cheat day next month.

03:02:51.740 --> 03:02:53.240
Alright.

03:02:53.240 --> 03:02:57.240
Um, final word, one word of the show to sum it all up.

03:02:57.240 --> 03:03:02.740
Don't forget kids, send in your haikus to win our copy of In the Groove 573 style.

03:03:02.740 --> 03:03:07.020
Garrett, the Poppin' Music Whore, gets one word to sum up the whole show, the final word

03:03:07.020 --> 03:03:10.740
of the night.

03:03:10.740 --> 03:03:16.260

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:59.260 --> 03:04:08.260
Won't you climb up high, high through the sky and choose them all?

03:04:09.260 --> 03:04:20.260
Cause they don't deserve to live, what did they ever give to you?

03:04:20.260 --> 03:04:22.260
Na-na-na-na-na-na

03:04:22.260 --> 03:04:26.260
What I want you to do, I want you to go upstairs to that apartment where that guy keeps playing that fairy tale

03:04:26.260 --> 03:04:28.260
I could cook banana over and over and over again

03:04:28.260 --> 03:04:30.260
I want you to ring the doorbell, nobody answers the door

03:04:30.260 --> 03:04:32.260
I want you to stab him in the neck with a number two pencil

03:04:32.260 --> 03:04:34.260
Over and over and over again, because he

03:04:34.260 --> 03:04:36.260
must pay!

03:04:36.260 --> 03:04:38.260
Shut him up and put him in the freezer as you leave the apartment

03:04:38.260 --> 03:04:40.260
Light the place on fire!

03:04:40.260 --> 03:04:42.260
Voices in my head

03:04:42.260 --> 03:04:44.260
Please love

03:04:44.260 --> 03:04:46.260
The voices in my head

03:04:46.260 --> 03:04:48.260
Voices in my head

03:04:48.260 --> 03:04:50.260
Please love

03:04:50.260 --> 03:04:52.260
The voices in my head

03:04:52.260 --> 03:04:55.260
She dressed up like a clown

03:05:00.260 --> 03:05:02.260
Bobby!

03:05:04.260 --> 03:05:07.260
Hi! You never called me back, I got the pictures back from Thanksgiving

03:05:07.260 --> 03:05:10.260
I don't know why you wear that earring, if your father was alive, I don't know what he'd say

03:05:10.260 --> 03:05:13.260
I was talking to Mrs. Corelli yesterday, you know Bobby Corelli was in your grave?

03:05:13.260 --> 03:05:16.260
He got promoted again at his law firm, he's making $175,000 a year now

03:05:16.260 --> 03:05:19.260
Are you on drugs? Why don't you ever call me back?

03:05:19.260 --> 03:05:20.400
When are you gonna get married, son?

03:05:20.520 --> 03:05:21.820
It's been about time you settled down

03:05:21.820 --> 03:05:23.540
and got yourself a wife, got yourself a house

03:05:23.540 --> 03:05:25.400
and got a kid and got a car and got a dog

03:05:25.400 --> 03:05:27.220
and got a lawnmower and got a nice movie set

03:05:27.220 --> 03:05:29.960
The voices in my head

03:05:29.960 --> 03:05:31.760
Move on

03:05:31.760 --> 03:05:33.360
The voices in my head

03:05:33.620 --> 03:05:35.660
The voices in my head

03:05:35.860 --> 03:05:37.540
Move on

03:05:37.800 --> 03:05:43.680
The voices in my head

03:05:43.780 --> 03:05:47.840
The voices in my head

03:05:47.840 --> 03:06:00.840
Why, why is it every time I gotta win our fuckin' line?

03:06:02.840 --> 03:06:07.840
Why is it every time I turn on my television set I gotta see Sally Struthers and those starving kids?

03:06:07.840 --> 03:06:12.840
Why can't somebody just send her a chat and shut her and those goddamn kids off?

03:06:12.840 --> 03:06:14.840
Where's Rob Reiner when you need him?

03:06:14.840 --> 03:06:25.140
Why, why don't they drop the bomb right on top of everyone?

03:06:27.440 --> 03:06:31.340
the voice in my head as I speak a home

03:06:31.340 --> 03:06:36.940
the voice in my interest and my wisdom

03:06:36.940 --> 03:06:41.660
the voice in my voice and my health

03:06:41.660 --> 03:06:43.660
Operators standing by

03:06:43.660 --> 03:06:45.140
Don't cry, don't, don't play no games

03:06:45.160 --> 03:06:46.460
Is anybody else here there

03:06:46.480 --> 03:06:47.660
Don't cry, don't, don't play no games

03:06:47.680 --> 03:06:49.320
Is anybody else here

03:06:49.340 --> 03:06:50.460
Is anybody else here

03:06:50.480 --> 03:06:52.080
Is anybody else here

03:06:52.100 --> 03:06:54.000
There's somebody else in the door

03:06:54.020 --> 03:06:56.040
Is anybody else here

03:06:56.060 --> 03:06:58.420
There's somebody else in the door

03:06:58.440 --> 03:06:59.920
Is anybody else here

03:06:59.940 --> 03:07:01.940
Is anybody else here

03:07:01.960 --> 03:07:03.660
Is anybody else here

03:07:03.680 --> 03:07:06.320
Stop, stop, stop with the singing!

03:07:08.640 --> 03:07:09.420
Phew!

03:07:09.420 --> 03:07:39.260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:07:39.420 --> 03:07:48.420
Chat room is incessantly asking where they can download the vremix. Can they download that anywhere? Do they have to buy the diverse thing?

03:07:48.420 --> 03:08:00.420
Well, if alt control delete was still up, they're having bandwidth issues right now, but there's a torrent on altcontroldelete.com. They have a whole diverse systems folder.

03:08:00.420 --> 03:08:06.420
But that'd be where you'd find it. But until they come back, no. I don't know.

03:08:06.420 --> 03:08:10.180
don't know all right thanks you guys tuning in and listening we're now going

03:08:10.180 --> 03:08:14.060
