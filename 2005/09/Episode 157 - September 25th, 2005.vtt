[SPEAKER_06]: I cannot stop playing this game.

02:33.168 --> 02:34.728
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a highly sore point with me.

02:35.408 --> 02:37.809
[SPEAKER_06]: No one at my work wanted it, so I got it by default.

02:38.823 --> 02:43.326
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, okay, well, we'll get to all things Bomani and all things gaming.

02:43.386 --> 02:44.766
[SPEAKER_06]: And I get to see face in the groove!

02:45.347 --> 02:48.148

[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, Jamie Summers

05:38.937 --> 05:39.878
[SPEAKER_06]: I totally just lied.

05:40.238 --> 05:41.479
[SPEAKER_10]: She's not a bunny.

05:42.860 --> 05:43.900
[SPEAKER_06]: She's a giggling schoolgirl.

05:43.940 --> 05:45.582
[SPEAKER_06]: We established that on the last podcast.

05:46.802 --> 05:47.563
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I got the glare.

05:47.923 --> 05:48.824
[SPEAKER_06]: I got the glare, kids.

05:48.924 --> 05:50.145
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't find that funny at all.

05:50.585 --> 05:50.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

05:51.446 --> 05:53.007
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I don't appreciate sexism.

05:53.607 --> 05:54.988
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be talking about that later on.

05:55.969 --> 05:58.510
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, actually, okay.

05:58.530 --> 05:59.031
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

05:59.051 --> 05:59.491
[SPEAKER_10]: Good.

06:00.011 --> 06:01.092
[SPEAKER_06]: Good to hear.

06:01.152 --> 06:02.013
[SPEAKER_10]: It probably pissed me off.

06:02.533 --> 06:04.995
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll be talking about...

06:06.047 --> 06:07.768
[SPEAKER_06]: Reasons for that throughout tonight's show.

06:08.188 --> 06:10.470
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, say hello to Techmaster Loki.

06:10.890 --> 06:16.913
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate all forms of sex, including those with, you know, whatever suffixes you have.

06:18.134 --> 06:18.374
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

06:20.015 --> 06:22.096
[SPEAKER_06]: Sexism, sex, you name it.

06:22.296 --> 06:23.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I get it.

06:23.317 --> 06:23.617
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

06:25.158 --> 06:26.098
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, it went over your head.

06:26.118 --> 06:26.459
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

06:26.479 --> 06:26.999
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's all right.

06:27.139 --> 06:30.061
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a big block of cheese I'm nibbling on.

06:30.981 --> 06:32.742
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki just snacks on cheese during the show.

06:33.222 --> 06:34.283
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big block of Parmesan cheese.

06:35.465 --> 06:37.446
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't the first time either.

06:37.847 --> 06:41.409
[SPEAKER_06]: Also here tonight, say hello to the resident poppin' music whore.

06:43.030 --> 06:43.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Mr. Garrett, over there.

06:44.170 --> 06:45.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, how are you?

06:45.891 --> 06:46.992
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm good, I'm a whore.

06:47.512 --> 06:49.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you are a whore, but you also play games.

06:50.074 --> 06:50.994
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

06:51.434 --> 06:53.295
[SPEAKER_07]: This whore's on vacation, so this whore's happy.

06:54.136 --> 06:56.838
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, congratulations.

06:56.878 --> 07:01.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello also to the one and only TechMassa intern, Bugged.

07:02.801 --> 07:03.601
[SPEAKER_06]: Intern my ass.

07:05.391 --> 07:07.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we already have a tech master, so you have to be the intern.

07:08.192 --> 07:09.112
[SPEAKER_10]: How about specialist?

07:10.272 --> 07:10.792
[SPEAKER_06]: That might work.

07:11.012 --> 07:11.653
[SPEAKER_22]: Tech specialist.

07:11.793 --> 07:12.433
[SPEAKER_06]: Tech specialist.

07:12.813 --> 07:14.433
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have two laptops on me at the moment.

07:14.613 --> 07:15.133
[SPEAKER_22]: Tech bitch.

07:15.974 --> 07:16.434
[SPEAKER_06]: Tech bitch.

07:16.654 --> 07:17.174
[SPEAKER_06]: I like bitch.

07:18.274 --> 07:18.674
[SPEAKER_06]: Minion.

07:19.474 --> 07:20.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, maybe.

07:20.135 --> 07:20.835
[SPEAKER_06]: I will take minion.

07:20.855 --> 07:21.335
[SPEAKER_06]: Minion.

07:21.555 --> 07:24.055
[SPEAKER_06]: I like minion because it makes me sound evil.

07:24.856 --> 07:25.236
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

07:25.256 --> 07:25.576
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

07:26.536 --> 07:28.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, as we promised tonight, show should be fun.

07:28.497 --> 07:29.537
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to give some shit away.

07:29.577 --> 07:31.917
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about the Ultramix 3 VRare.

07:31.937 --> 07:34.078
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to play a lot of tracks from the Ultramix 3 VRare.

07:35.269 --> 07:43.852
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to talk about DDR EX 2 which is out this week and you know some of the other game stuff we've been doing too and what's going on in the music game world.

07:44.572 --> 07:56.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Also tonight we're going to preview some tracks from a particular album that was just released recently so stay tuned to see what tracks are going to do from that and a whole lot more.

07:56.695 --> 08:02.797
[SPEAKER_06]: So let's get to it, let's get to our first break and we'll come back and do a little bit of How was your week, how was your day and your calls later on this evening.

08:03.497 --> 08:05.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask Orange Lounge if we have time.

08:05.219 --> 08:16.889
[SPEAKER_06]: This break we're not going to get straight to the Ultramix 3 because I heard some folks in our chat room over at OrangeLoungeRadio.com they were gushing over Chorus K so I'm going to throw some Chorus K their way and make them happy.

08:16.949 --> 08:17.289
[SPEAKER_06]: So here it is.

08:17.309 --> 08:18.870
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to start off with a little Love is Eternity.

08:19.090 --> 08:20.792
[SPEAKER_06]: What does Dell fill their laptops with?

08:21.472 --> 08:21.833
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

08:21.873 --> 08:25.496
[SPEAKER_06]: That was scary during the opening.

08:25.536 --> 08:29.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we'll be back after this after some Love is Eternity here on Orange Lounge Radio.

11:09.629 --> 11:10.972
Thanks for watching!

12:14.088 --> 12:15.023
Thanks for watching!

12:59.088 --> 12:59.709
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

14:09.787 --> 14:11.010
We are the planet on the run

14:46.716 --> 14:52.239
We are the landings from the sun We're all like landings from the sun We are the landings from the sun

15:40.387 --> 15:46.732
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're like lemons on the run We are the lemons on the run We are like lemons on the run We are the lemons on the run

16:08.004 --> 16:08.984
[SPEAKER_05]: Gaming Radio.

16:09.224 --> 16:16.467
[SPEAKER_05]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

16:16.667 --> 16:18.007
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio.

16:19.608 --> 16:22.108
[SPEAKER_06]: We're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

16:22.568 --> 16:24.749
[SPEAKER_06]: And in that break you heard a little bit of Love is Eternity.

16:25.990 --> 16:30.651
[SPEAKER_06]: Atomic Kitten from Third Style slash Fifth Mix right now.

16:31.522 --> 16:36.263
[SPEAKER_06]: Ryu Setsugeka from TenStyle, and Erotic Lemmings on the Run from In the Groove.

16:36.823 --> 16:38.244
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would I play an In the Groove song?

16:38.264 --> 16:41.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we're going to be doing an In the Groove game giveaway.

16:42.565 --> 16:44.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we're doing that tonight.

16:44.366 --> 16:47.446
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to think of the rules for how we want the giveaway to work, so we're going to talk about that.

16:47.807 --> 16:53.168
[SPEAKER_06]: However, this copy of In the Groove has a special treat with it.

16:53.228 --> 16:54.708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not just any copy of In the Groove.

16:54.989 --> 17:00.110
[SPEAKER_06]: It is an In the Groove copy signed by Loki, DarkSakura, and myself.

17:00.839 --> 17:03.781
[SPEAKER_06]: with our own little sayings on it for you guys

17:18.482 --> 17:19.683
[SPEAKER_06]: V-Rares for DDR Max 2 and DDR EX 2

17:35.399 --> 17:36.460
[SPEAKER_06]: Unless you can find them.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.523
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what we're going to do, we're going to give away, I guess we'll give them away in Paris.

17:40.643 --> 17:43.605
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give away an EX-2 and MAX-2 CD together.

17:44.266 --> 17:49.629
[SPEAKER_06]: And all you've got to do, we'll give away one tonight, live on the show, and then we'll give away one through our podcast.

17:49.910 --> 17:50.250
[SPEAKER_06]: Sound good?

17:50.270 --> 17:51.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, cool.

17:51.551 --> 17:59.997
[SPEAKER_06]: So, what you're going to do, you want to get in now, because there's thousands of people that listen to the podcast, but there's probably only about 12 that listen to this program.

18:00.337 --> 18:02.659
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, it's more than that, but it's significantly less.

18:04.102 --> 18:05.923
[SPEAKER_06]: Get your name in now if you want to win one of these.

18:06.243 --> 18:13.248
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do, it's easy, you don't even have to think about it, just send an email to freestuff at orangeloungeradio.com.

18:13.588 --> 18:17.611
[SPEAKER_06]: Free stuff, all one word, freestuff at orangeloungeradio.com.

18:18.172 --> 18:22.054
[SPEAKER_06]: One entry per person, if you enter twice, I'm going to beat you up.

18:22.935 --> 18:25.196
[SPEAKER_10]: I say entering twice is a disqualification.

18:25.316 --> 18:28.799
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, if you enter twice, we'll ban you.

18:30.100 --> 18:31.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like you were a Ragnarok player.

18:31.540 --> 18:32.081
[SPEAKER_06]: We will ban you.

18:32.121 --> 18:32.481
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding.

18:32.921 --> 18:34.181
[SPEAKER_06]: We will just ban you.

18:34.241 --> 18:36.202
[SPEAKER_06]: So just one entry per person, please.

18:36.982 --> 18:38.062
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to give that away.

18:38.322 --> 18:44.964
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, if you enter right now, you'll also be entered for the one we're going to do on the podcast anyway because I'm going to check from the same email account.

18:45.304 --> 18:47.945
[SPEAKER_06]: So get in now before the night is over.

18:48.345 --> 18:49.885
[SPEAKER_06]: So you've got a couple hours there.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Do those of us currently here qualify?

18:53.406 --> 18:53.526
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

18:53.546 --> 18:53.586
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

18:54.926 --> 18:56.547
[SPEAKER_10]: Because some of us in the room already have them.

18:56.647 --> 18:58.587
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, some of us can get them other ways.

18:59.147 --> 18:59.968
[SPEAKER_06]: Wink, wink, nudge, nudge.

19:00.188 --> 19:03.049
[SPEAKER_06]: But these are authentic copies of EX2.

19:03.369 --> 19:07.230
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you cannot just send me a message because I'm overwhelmed with private messages as it is.

19:07.570 --> 19:08.331
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to collect them.

19:08.351 --> 19:13.712
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, there are some people that are just shy and don't want to join the chat room, so we can let them send an email.

19:14.032 --> 19:17.494
[SPEAKER_06]: All you have to do, free stuff at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

19:17.534 --> 19:19.994
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, this is not for the In The Groove giveaway.

19:20.335 --> 19:24.356
[SPEAKER_06]: This is for the Extreme 2 slash Max 2 VRares.

19:25.014 --> 19:26.995
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura My week was just

19:51.997 --> 19:54.759
[SPEAKER_10]: Eh, regular stuff.

19:56.700 --> 19:59.002
[SPEAKER_10]: I played a few games, hung out.

19:59.262 --> 20:04.906
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, Dan was gone most of the week at the GameStop manager conference in Texas.

20:05.767 --> 20:18.216
[SPEAKER_10]: So I sat around by myself a lot, except for going to a party, going to the club, playing with my Nintendogs, playing some Beatmania, playing World of Warcraft.

20:19.813 --> 20:20.614
[SPEAKER_10]: Really, that's about it.

20:20.674 --> 20:24.957
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh yeah, and I played on the main for a little bit, a bit more Puyo Puyo arcade version.

20:26.018 --> 20:29.742
[SPEAKER_10]: And Blazing Star and Pulsar, or Pulsar, I'm sorry.

20:30.662 --> 20:37.368
[SPEAKER_10]: And Metal Slug 5 and a bunch of crap just because I was really bored hanging out in the garage doing laundry.

20:38.549 --> 20:38.709
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

20:43.456 --> 20:45.940
[SPEAKER_10]: That's really how my week went.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.466
[SPEAKER_10]: Dan came home today, which was good, and then he promptly left to go play Madden at the neighbor's house.

20:51.903 --> 20:53.304
[SPEAKER_10]: which he said, oh, I told you.

20:53.404 --> 20:57.346
[SPEAKER_10]: I was like, well, you didn't tell me where I could actually hear you when you were in the same room with me.

20:58.067 --> 20:58.907
[SPEAKER_10]: So I didn't know.

20:58.947 --> 20:59.468
[SPEAKER_10]: He just disappeared.

20:59.488 --> 21:03.210
[SPEAKER_10]: So I got involved in a project and he came like, oh, you want to play Madden with me?

21:03.990 --> 21:06.212
[SPEAKER_10]: That game sucks and American football sucks.

21:06.832 --> 21:09.173
[SPEAKER_10]: Why would I want to do something that doubly sucks?

21:09.774 --> 21:10.414
[SPEAKER_10]: That's okay.

21:10.894 --> 21:12.335
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm doing something that doesn't suck.

21:14.522 --> 21:18.205
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you said in the intro you were a little bitter over We Heart Katamari.

21:18.226 --> 21:18.726
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.307
[SPEAKER_04]: Because... How can you be bitter?

21:20.327 --> 21:22.109
[SPEAKER_10]: Data Game came out at GameStop.

21:22.930 --> 21:23.871
[SPEAKER_10]: He was on the plane.

21:24.371 --> 21:25.372
[SPEAKER_10]: He couldn't buy my game.

21:25.612 --> 21:29.236
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I can wait a little bit to get something at a 30% discount.

21:30.117 --> 21:32.159
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see paying full price when I don't have to.

21:33.119 --> 21:34.000
[SPEAKER_10]: I am a frugal gamer.

21:35.422 --> 21:35.602
[SPEAKER_10]: So...

21:36.397 --> 21:37.478
[SPEAKER_10]: and I'll see you next time.

22:05.518 --> 22:13.361
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, yeah, I've played the Japanese one, but they talk about it as though I have it now and I don't have it yet and act like it's the end of the world.

22:13.661 --> 22:14.981
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like, fuck you!

22:15.681 --> 22:16.962
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get it the day it came out.

22:17.202 --> 22:18.202
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it yesterday.

22:19.483 --> 22:22.203
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't really care to hear anything about that.

22:22.504 --> 22:26.865
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, with all the hype that's been going on, I've hit my saturation point of Katamari.

22:28.735 --> 22:29.896
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you, it is really good, though.

22:30.076 --> 22:30.916
[SPEAKER_06]: I wasn't disappointed.

22:34.078 --> 22:35.219
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you'll have a change of heart.

22:35.359 --> 22:35.599
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

22:35.859 --> 22:36.059
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.

22:36.160 --> 22:38.401
[SPEAKER_10]: Honestly, I really don't care when I get it.

22:39.141 --> 22:46.606
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as I can go 24 hours without seeing or hearing the word Katamari, I will play it.

22:48.714 --> 22:53.957
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not joking because I have not been able to go that long without either hearing it or seeing it.

22:54.377 --> 23:00.381
[SPEAKER_10]: So when I can go 24 hours without hearing or seeing the word Katamari, I will play it.

23:01.101 --> 23:02.242
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that could be a while.

23:03.863 --> 23:05.143
[SPEAKER_23]: It's today's secret word.

23:05.503 --> 23:07.805
[SPEAKER_23]: When you hear today's secret word, scream real loud.

23:10.126 --> 23:12.547
[SPEAKER_23]: Today's secret word is Katamari.

23:13.588 --> 23:15.449
[SPEAKER_23]: So when you hear today's secret word, scream real loud.

23:18.373 --> 23:19.173
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, how was your week?

23:19.213 --> 23:19.753
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

23:20.634 --> 23:23.374
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't start off like I was going to, but okay.

23:24.234 --> 23:24.755
[SPEAKER_06]: My week was good.

23:24.775 --> 23:26.515
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually got a lot of the wedding stuff done.

23:27.015 --> 23:28.015
[SPEAKER_06]: Location's done.

23:29.276 --> 23:31.316
[SPEAKER_06]: She has her dress, you know, being ordered.

23:31.656 --> 23:32.356
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all done.

23:32.937 --> 23:33.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, we're done.

23:33.957 --> 23:35.597
[SPEAKER_06]: So, thank God!

23:35.617 --> 23:37.738
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice of the wait.

23:38.378 --> 23:39.198
[SPEAKER_06]: Play the waiting game now.

23:40.999 --> 23:44.499
[SPEAKER_06]: No, but actually, I meant to play more games this week.

23:44.599 --> 23:46.700
[SPEAKER_06]: I played a lot of Burnout Revenge, per usual.

23:47.396 --> 23:53.500
[SPEAKER_06]: and my one gripe of Burnout Revenge is their random track selection isn't quite random.

23:53.620 --> 24:02.887
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I get the same track every time I do random, so I'm kind of wondering why, you know, it's so faulty, but it's still a fun track.

24:03.707 --> 24:06.149
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, let's see, what else?

24:06.289 --> 24:16.956
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I got my free copy of We Love Katamari, and I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet, and I was trying to make time to play Graffiti Kingdom since I've had it for a month and haven't touched it yet,

24:17.657 --> 24:19.578
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right, I still haven't touched the Hello Kitty game.

24:20.998 --> 24:26.241
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that I can understand, but, you know, Graffiti Canyon, I was, like, drooling over it, you know, when I got it, and I haven't even played it.

24:26.781 --> 24:35.264
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, I'll get to it eventually, um, but now I have to go beg, um, my contact to Konami for some copies of, uh, Xtreme 2.

24:36.065 --> 24:40.746
[SPEAKER_06]: I hinted to him that I wanted some, and now I will just bluntly say, can you send me some?

24:41.887 --> 24:42.427
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we'll see.

24:43.528 --> 24:44.328
[SPEAKER_06]: But, uh, yeah.

24:44.348 --> 24:44.428
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

24:44.807 --> 24:48.369
[SPEAKER_06]: and then I've been having this urge to buy stuff and I haven't been able to find anything.

24:48.489 --> 24:54.452
[SPEAKER_06]: I walked around Best Buy aimlessly looking for something to buy and there was just nothing there at all.

24:54.912 --> 24:55.152
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.

24:57.033 --> 24:57.333
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.

24:58.474 --> 24:59.655
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I'm eating a block of cheese.

24:59.895 --> 25:00.575
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost gone.

25:01.316 --> 25:05.758
[SPEAKER_06]: I have to eat it because I have another block of cheese at home and they're planning on buying me another one.

25:06.238 --> 25:08.159
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, S.O.C.

25:08.179 --> 25:09.140
[SPEAKER_06]: Horse Brides, that was fun.

25:09.580 --> 25:10.020
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a good movie.

25:12.076 --> 25:12.956
[SPEAKER_04]: Good times!

25:13.597 --> 25:13.837
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

25:13.857 --> 25:14.037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

25:15.117 --> 25:15.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugged, how was your week?

25:15.937 --> 25:16.418
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

25:17.798 --> 25:25.121
[SPEAKER_22]: I did not get a chance to play Burnout 4 because my roommate scored a free Xbox from one of his friends that has been playing Jet Set Radio Future at all hours.

25:25.781 --> 25:27.002
[SPEAKER_22]: So... Nothing wrong with that.

25:27.322 --> 25:29.382
[SPEAKER_22]: We only have one set of hookups at a time.

25:30.243 --> 25:34.404
[SPEAKER_22]: But lots of calamari... That game.

25:34.544 --> 25:35.685
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

25:37.145 --> 25:37.746
[SPEAKER_22]: Lots of that.

25:38.746 --> 25:39.886
[SPEAKER_22]: And I can't kick anyone.

25:39.946 --> 25:40.847
[SPEAKER_22]: Damn, that would be a lot of fun.

25:43.120 --> 25:43.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you want to kick people?

25:43.920 --> 25:45.801
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, I'll just... Oh, okay.

25:46.481 --> 25:47.401
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, yeah!

25:48.162 --> 25:55.604
[SPEAKER_22]: Cool, I get to kick fun... Anyway, I played Trash Pick.

25:56.925 --> 25:57.165
[SPEAKER_16]: What?

25:58.945 --> 26:00.886
[SPEAKER_22]: Played Trash Pick, scored four IMAX last night.

26:02.046 --> 26:02.547
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that?

26:03.727 --> 26:09.249
[SPEAKER_22]: It's where you go around to people's trash, you know, the trash areas, and people have thrown out computers, and there was four IMAX.

26:11.038 --> 26:12.439
[SPEAKER_06]: People throw out iMacs?

26:12.579 --> 26:13.279
[SPEAKER_22]: G3 iMacs.

26:13.299 --> 26:13.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

26:14.379 --> 26:14.599
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

26:14.819 --> 26:15.380
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, no.

26:16.560 --> 26:17.080
[SPEAKER_06]: What, Loki?

26:18.401 --> 26:18.661
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

26:21.682 --> 26:23.963
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're good at least for their monitor.

26:23.983 --> 26:30.105
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly say it's wrong to throw out anything that's not broken, especially computer-wise, unless it's really old.

26:30.605 --> 26:31.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can always use them for parts.

26:32.386 --> 26:35.507
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if it is an iMac, you can still part that out for something.

26:35.727 --> 26:36.487
[SPEAKER_22]: That's why we picked them up.

26:36.627 --> 26:37.728
[SPEAKER_06]: For the monitor, at least.

26:37.888 --> 26:38.948
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know,

26:39.905 --> 26:42.828
[SPEAKER_06]: Flat screen monitor, you shouldn't throw that away.

26:43.088 --> 26:44.909
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, no, no, no, these are old ones, these are the CRTs.

26:45.630 --> 26:47.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, then they suck.

26:48.893 --> 26:50.374
[SPEAKER_06]: They were where they belonged.

26:53.176 --> 26:54.938
[SPEAKER_04]: How can people throw those away?

26:56.519 --> 26:57.340
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, oh, okay.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.843
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh my god, you... You didn't throw away another one, I want it.

27:03.064 --> 27:03.325
[SPEAKER_22]: It's a G3.

27:04.238 --> 27:05.738
[SPEAKER_10]: So, I can do something with it.

27:06.159 --> 27:06.419
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

27:06.979 --> 27:08.959
[SPEAKER_22]: You can make a flower pot out of it.

27:09.099 --> 27:10.540
[SPEAKER_22]: They need hard drives and RAM, that's about it.

27:11.240 --> 27:12.560
[SPEAKER_22]: Standard stuff.

27:12.660 --> 27:13.441
[SPEAKER_10]: I have all that.

27:13.681 --> 27:21.023
[SPEAKER_22]: And an impromptu barbecue, and we have WeHeart something something something party last night.

27:23.163 --> 27:28.245
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe what they've come up with in the chatroom is WeHeart calamari, like the appetizer, the squid.

27:28.265 --> 27:30.946
[SPEAKER_10]: And everybody's spelling it right, so I just left the chatroom because everyone pissed me off.

27:31.126 --> 27:31.566
[SPEAKER_06]: Aww.

27:31.626 --> 27:32.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

27:33.931 --> 27:35.032
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually really do, but anyway.

27:35.052 --> 27:36.333
[SPEAKER_22]: But I got up, so I can still kick people.

27:36.534 --> 27:37.374
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, go for it.

27:38.696 --> 27:39.376
[SPEAKER_22]: That was pretty much it.

27:40.978 --> 27:41.278
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

27:43.380 --> 27:45.182
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, the pop and music whore of Sacramento.

27:45.382 --> 27:45.722
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up?

27:45.922 --> 27:46.303
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your week?

27:46.323 --> 27:46.683
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

27:47.083 --> 27:49.005
[SPEAKER_06]: My week's gone... How much pop music did you play?

27:50.487 --> 27:51.047
[SPEAKER_07]: Since what?

27:51.067 --> 27:53.009
[SPEAKER_07]: Since like however many months ago I was here?

27:53.029 --> 27:53.509
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

27:53.750 --> 27:53.950
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

27:54.722 --> 27:55.443
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

28:08.949 --> 28:09.169
[SPEAKER_06]: 43, wow.

28:09.309 --> 28:12.510
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've beaten, I think, five 41s now.

28:12.650 --> 28:14.630
[SPEAKER_07]: I just beat Rinsei EX.

28:15.131 --> 28:20.052
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, and then I couldn't do it after that, of course.

28:20.132 --> 28:23.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have any more videos on the interweb of you playing Papa Music?

28:23.433 --> 28:25.133
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I remember there used to be one on Bomani Style.

28:25.493 --> 28:27.694
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I didn't even ask him to put that shit up.

28:28.414 --> 28:36.596
[SPEAKER_07]: And then some asshole on Bomani Style totally was just making fun of me for it, and then he submitted his own video of him getting a better score.

28:37.711 --> 28:38.031
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever.

28:38.731 --> 28:42.013
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sent it to DJ... Some people just have to show how big their wingers are.

28:42.033 --> 28:46.114
[SPEAKER_07]: I just sent it to DJP to show him, like, you know, like, oh, I'm just playing with Adobe right now.

28:46.134 --> 28:48.135
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm, you know, putting this shit together.

28:49.496 --> 28:51.556
[SPEAKER_07]: But, yeah, okay.

28:51.616 --> 28:52.417
[SPEAKER_07]: My week's been alright.

28:52.497 --> 28:56.958
[SPEAKER_07]: I just started vacation on Friday, and I'm on vacation for ten days!

28:57.078 --> 28:57.679
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

28:57.699 --> 28:58.059
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay!

28:58.119 --> 29:00.940
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll be five days here and five days in Georgia.

29:02.261 --> 29:03.502
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you doing in Georgia now?

29:03.662 --> 29:04.764
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to a wedding.

29:05.064 --> 29:10.611
[SPEAKER_07]: It's this girl I grew up with, and her grandma is one of my mom's best friends.

29:10.631 --> 29:11.813
[SPEAKER_07]: They all live together and whatever.

29:12.093 --> 29:15.958
[SPEAKER_07]: But anyway, since I've never really been out of the state, it'll be like going out of the country for me.

29:17.100 --> 29:18.962
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, I don't know, that'll be fun.

29:20.737 --> 29:22.618
[SPEAKER_07]: Have fun with that humidity on the East Coast.

29:22.638 --> 29:25.020
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the first thing you'll notice when you visit the East Coast, humidity.

29:25.400 --> 29:26.340
[SPEAKER_06]: At least for me.

29:26.660 --> 29:27.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

29:27.041 --> 29:28.982
[SPEAKER_06]: You step on the plane and you go, Sheesh!

29:29.782 --> 29:30.162
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

29:30.583 --> 29:33.845
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, just like I'm sure when people from the East Coast come to here, they go, Sheesh!

29:35.205 --> 29:36.446
[SPEAKER_15]: What's wrong with you people?

29:36.586 --> 29:37.867
[SPEAKER_15]: How can you live here?

29:38.287 --> 29:39.148
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't breathe!

29:39.228 --> 29:43.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I think for most it's a relief, but I mean... And the people from the Midwest just go, Sheesh, anyways.

29:44.491 --> 29:44.871
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway...

29:46.343 --> 29:51.786
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah, today I've just, I don't know, I was bored and slept all day and then got up like, oh, play Katamari a little while more.

29:53.307 --> 30:01.831
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had to be a dork and even though I already have the Japanese version, I went and bought the English version on Friday just so I could enjoy the King's English humor.

30:02.491 --> 30:06.033
[SPEAKER_07]: And then noticed quite a few changes between the Japanese and American versions.

30:06.073 --> 30:10.356
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, a lot of them just really superficial changes, some of them really dumb, but whatever.

30:12.497 --> 30:12.837
[SPEAKER_07]: But yeah.

30:13.823 --> 30:15.184
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my day and week, I guess.

30:15.564 --> 30:15.984
[SPEAKER_07]: Any other game?

30:16.884 --> 30:17.465
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, yes.

30:18.445 --> 30:20.106
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell was up with the manual?

30:20.426 --> 30:22.307
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at that and I'm like, what the hell is this?

30:22.667 --> 30:27.309
[SPEAKER_06]: Because the screenshots, he made it kind of look like they were painted with watercolors.

30:27.729 --> 30:29.250
[SPEAKER_06]: And I hope that's not what the game looks like.

30:30.251 --> 30:30.291
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

30:30.311 --> 30:30.511
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

30:32.071 --> 30:34.472
[SPEAKER_07]: No, that's just the art director's style that he does.

30:34.512 --> 30:38.774
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of the wallpapers and stuff they put up on the Japanese site, they look all weird like that.

30:39.635 --> 30:42.016
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of them don't even look like they really have much to do with the game.

30:42.651 --> 30:46.520
[SPEAKER_07]: And like when he redraws the characters in that style, they look all super goofy and whatever.

30:46.540 --> 30:47.683
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

30:47.703 --> 30:49.587
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

30:51.648 --> 30:55.030
[SPEAKER_06]: My week and my day, I actually didn't do a whole lot, really.

30:55.230 --> 30:56.551
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been pretty sad this week.

30:57.352 --> 31:02.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Just work, a lot, a lot of work, and because of that, a lot, a lot of napping after work because work kind of drains me a lot.

31:02.916 --> 31:07.320
[SPEAKER_06]: So I didn't really go anywhere exciting or do anything that great.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.762
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish I had something to share, but I don't.

31:09.822 --> 31:19.029
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to Fry's yesterday, and I was just, you know, I bought the K game there, and I was actually, my friend's monitor just about blew up.

31:19.611 --> 31:24.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Apparently it started shooting out blue sparks when he tried turning it on, which isn't a good thing.

31:24.955 --> 31:26.857
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, Loki's going, yeah!

31:27.578 --> 31:29.699
[SPEAKER_06]: But we decided to go look at new monitors.

31:29.779 --> 31:33.763
[SPEAKER_06]: And I kind of want a new monitor now too, although the one I have is really good, I can't complain.

31:34.483 --> 31:36.025
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a flat screen.

31:36.785 --> 31:37.526
[SPEAKER_06]: It was free.

31:37.906 --> 31:39.948
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it was, and that's why I can't complain about it.

31:40.328 --> 31:42.289
[SPEAKER_06]: But I want a flat screen.

31:42.609 --> 31:44.009
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a little black flat screen.

31:44.069 --> 31:44.710
[SPEAKER_22]: I did the same thing.

31:44.910 --> 31:45.910
[SPEAKER_22]: I do have a black flat screen.

31:45.950 --> 31:46.450
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.

31:46.550 --> 31:46.730
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

31:46.750 --> 31:47.330
[SPEAKER_06]: It works a lot better.

31:47.370 --> 31:47.571
[SPEAKER_06]: See?

31:47.871 --> 31:48.431
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean.

31:48.471 --> 31:51.712
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll be less heat because it gets really hot in here during the show sometimes.

31:52.132 --> 31:56.454
[SPEAKER_22]: It'll kill a few of us and that'll cut down on the heat.

31:57.494 --> 32:02.996
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but I just, you know, that would help cut back on the heat and maybe getting a better fan for this behemoth computer down here.

32:03.276 --> 32:04.696
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you can hear my fan.

32:04.736 --> 32:05.797
[SPEAKER_06]: You probably can hear it over the air.

32:05.837 --> 32:06.337
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can.

32:09.935 --> 32:13.680
[SPEAKER_06]: you can't really hear it over the air but I have a ginormously loud fan

32:14.198 --> 32:17.419
[SPEAKER_06]: So if I could get a better cooling thing in my computer, I bet it would be cooler in here, too.

32:17.499 --> 32:20.040
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are just things I'm thinking about for the future.

32:20.620 --> 32:24.161
[SPEAKER_06]: So anyway, that was pretty much my week and day.

32:24.261 --> 32:26.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I played DDR when I was at Fry's.

32:26.582 --> 32:28.882
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually had the DDR Extreme set up.

32:29.222 --> 32:32.123
[SPEAKER_06]: Not Extreme 2, but DDR Extreme set up with the two pads.

32:32.663 --> 32:36.765
[SPEAKER_06]: And for soft pads that were taped to the ground, I'm surprised that things held up.

32:36.805 --> 32:40.326
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually did a pretty decent job on the song I was playing, so that was kind of fun.

32:43.129 --> 32:46.711
[SPEAKER_06]: One last hurrah on DDR Extreme before Extreme 2 comes out this week.

32:46.751 --> 32:47.311
[SPEAKER_06]: Which would be what?

32:47.351 --> 32:48.211
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it Tuesday, Wednesday?

32:48.271 --> 32:48.831
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll ask Track.

32:49.192 --> 32:50.292
[SPEAKER_06]: What day is it going to be on the shelves?

32:52.053 --> 32:52.493
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday?

32:52.673 --> 32:52.853
[SPEAKER_06]: 27th.

32:53.073 --> 32:54.894
[SPEAKER_06]: 27th will be on the shelf.

32:55.854 --> 32:56.494
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the ship day.

32:56.995 --> 32:57.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

32:57.435 --> 32:58.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Tuesday's the ship day?

32:59.155 --> 32:59.656
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.

32:59.676 --> 33:00.516
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm saying 27th.

33:01.516 --> 33:06.018
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be probably on shelves the 27th because that's what we have in our system as the street date.

33:06.438 --> 33:07.519
[SPEAKER_06]: Which means when we get it.

33:07.639 --> 33:09.499
[SPEAKER_06]: So that means that's probably when it's going to arrive.

33:09.999 --> 33:10.160
[SPEAKER_06]: 27th.

33:10.720 --> 33:11.080
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably the 27th.

33:13.413 --> 33:13.753
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

33:14.854 --> 33:19.455
[SPEAKER_06]: Although I know it's not going to show up for a lot of stores until Wednesday, so I'll probably just wait until Wednesday.

33:19.755 --> 33:21.196
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not in any huge rush.

33:21.296 --> 33:27.158
[SPEAKER_06]: I know a lot of people are really excited about DDR Extreme 2 because Konami's really kept a lid on it this time.

33:27.298 --> 33:34.201
[SPEAKER_06]: There's still a lot, a lot of secrets people don't know about this game yet, including what the freaking rest of the songs are outside the licenses.

33:34.701 --> 33:35.821
[SPEAKER_06]: What game?

33:35.881 --> 33:36.662
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Extreme 2.

33:37.082 --> 33:37.382
[SPEAKER_06]: What game?

33:37.782 --> 33:41.023
[SPEAKER_06]: The dancing game with the arrow smash, like whack-a-mole, but with your feet.

33:41.043 --> 33:42.664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a cheesy Eurobeat and stuff.

33:43.320 --> 33:45.321
[SPEAKER_22]: I thought you said they were keeping it under wraps that nobody knew about it.

33:45.401 --> 33:45.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, no, no, no.

33:46.241 --> 33:47.201
[SPEAKER_06]: People know about the game.

33:47.221 --> 33:48.241
[SPEAKER_06]: They just don't know anything about it.

33:48.461 --> 33:48.781
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

33:50.862 --> 33:51.302
[SPEAKER_07]: Unlock show?

33:52.202 --> 33:52.402
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm?

33:52.582 --> 33:53.062
[SPEAKER_07]: Unlock show?

33:54.803 --> 33:59.864
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to do one, but I don't think we've got the setup to do it anymore.

34:00.064 --> 34:07.166
[SPEAKER_06]: I know our mixing board will take my PS2 inputs right there, but I don't know what to do for video.

34:07.984 --> 34:09.385
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know if we can do an unlocked show.

34:09.605 --> 34:13.768
[SPEAKER_06]: Because my Commodore 64 monitor got stolen out of the back of my car by some neighborhood brats.

34:14.288 --> 34:19.152
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't have anything to plug it into unless we can find a little TV somehow.

34:20.372 --> 34:20.953
[SPEAKER_06]: You might have one?

34:21.473 --> 34:23.014
[SPEAKER_06]: We might have to do that then, like Wednesday night.

34:23.815 --> 34:24.055
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

34:25.843 --> 34:26.924
[SPEAKER_06]: To be continued, to be continued.

34:26.944 --> 34:27.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see.

34:28.064 --> 34:28.945
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm still looking for it.

34:28.965 --> 34:33.467
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking at Best Buy today, but they didn't have any VGA connectors.

34:33.807 --> 34:38.810
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm getting one for my Xbox 360 because I need something to be high def.

34:38.830 --> 34:41.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I'm not going to have a high def TV.

34:41.411 --> 34:44.913
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know how the hell that's going to work because most of the games are in high def anyways.

34:44.993 --> 34:46.174
[SPEAKER_06]: So if it's not in high def...

34:46.721 --> 34:48.022
[SPEAKER_06]: All your TV, what's that going to look like?

34:48.062 --> 34:49.243
[SPEAKER_06]: All messed up?

34:49.443 --> 34:56.988
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I believe the regular Xbox, what it does is that if you want to play your games in widescreen, it will letterbox the games.

34:57.068 --> 35:01.371
[SPEAKER_06]: There's the menu you can go into and change the options, so it'll probably just letterbox your games.

35:02.612 --> 35:03.872
[SPEAKER_06]: So your video games will look like movies.

35:03.892 --> 35:07.975
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they're all high-res and stuff, and my TV's not going to support that.

35:09.256 --> 35:11.578
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure they can filter the graphics down really quickly.

35:11.598 --> 35:15.100
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, anyways, I'm going to get a thing for my monitor, because it'll look pretty.

35:15.440 --> 35:16.041
[SPEAKER_06]: It will look pretty.

35:16.321 --> 35:16.601
[SPEAKER_06]: That way,

35:17.039 --> 35:18.040
[SPEAKER_06]: VGA Monitor Typing of the Dead

35:37.154 --> 35:38.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, good times.

35:38.396 --> 35:39.216
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

35:39.296 --> 35:40.257
[SPEAKER_06]: Space Channel 5 is this week.

35:40.658 --> 35:41.639
[SPEAKER_06]: I miss my Dreamcast.

35:41.659 --> 35:43.281
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get it out and dust it off and play.

35:43.321 --> 35:44.542
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have that many games for it.

35:44.642 --> 35:49.748
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I just, like, PSO, but I think I had Typing of the Dead and Samba somewhere.

35:50.008 --> 35:50.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

35:51.069 --> 35:51.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

35:53.609 --> 35:55.190
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm talking about pirated games.

35:56.950 --> 35:58.751
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't got to keep it a secret.

35:58.791 --> 35:59.691
[SPEAKER_06]: We got Loki on here.

35:59.911 --> 36:03.593
[SPEAKER_10]: Like pirate games like Skies of Arcadia.

36:03.633 --> 36:05.193
[SPEAKER_06]: I have not pirated any games this week.

36:05.233 --> 36:06.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

36:07.014 --> 36:14.336
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven days without... That means that some chick is going to climb out of his PSP monitor and steal his soul or something.

36:15.277 --> 36:16.677
[SPEAKER_22]: Did you speak like a pirate on Monday?

36:17.837 --> 36:19.618
[SPEAKER_22]: No, because I think that's retarded.

36:21.789 --> 36:22.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Yarr, you be retarded.

36:25.370 --> 36:32.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, yeah, I want to get off the Dreamcast and play some Choo Choo Rocket, because that was a game I really sucked at, so maybe I can get good at it now.

36:32.412 --> 36:33.112
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know what I want to play?

36:33.132 --> 36:42.495
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to play Power Stone, and I want to play... Power Stone was badass, and I want to play, um... Turbo Puzzle Fighter 2 Turbo.

36:43.695 --> 36:46.796
[SPEAKER_06]: No, there's another Dreamcast game I'm thinking of that I really want to play.

36:47.196 --> 36:47.956
[SPEAKER_10]: Space Channel 5?

36:48.056 --> 36:49.277
[SPEAKER_06]: Soul Calibur.

36:49.297 --> 36:50.357
[SPEAKER_10]: Soul Calibur.

36:51.175 --> 36:51.735
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no.

36:51.875 --> 36:54.937
[SPEAKER_10]: The ultimate in Soul Calibur fun is playing with the fishing controller.

36:56.398 --> 36:56.898
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

36:56.918 --> 36:58.760
[SPEAKER_06]: I've heard about that, playing with a fishing controller.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.080
[SPEAKER_10]: Because it's analog.

37:01.902 --> 37:05.804
[SPEAKER_10]: And, of course, every time you hit it, you're hitting basically one of the buttons, so it's really fabulous.

37:07.145 --> 37:07.445
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

37:07.765 --> 37:08.125
[SPEAKER_06]: Good times.

37:08.145 --> 37:08.926
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds rather athletic.

37:09.966 --> 37:15.910
[SPEAKER_06]: If you want to know what playing the Nintendo Revolution is going to be like, try playing Soul Calibur with a fishing controller.

37:17.371 --> 37:19.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Remind me to save that one for the podcast.

37:20.996 --> 37:25.301
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been doing that for a long time, the fishing controller thing.

37:25.621 --> 37:32.508
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember trying to play Soul Calibur with my Dreamcast DDR pad, and the only analog button is the Konami logo.

37:34.390 --> 37:34.710
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

37:34.851 --> 37:35.571
[SPEAKER_10]: So you can't really move.

37:37.563 --> 37:42.585
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember, I don't remember whose house we did this at, it was either Iguana Girls House or your house.

37:42.625 --> 37:43.905
[SPEAKER_10]: We did Project Justice, yeah.

37:44.045 --> 37:48.587
[SPEAKER_06]: But we played Bust a Move Groove on Dance Pads once.

37:48.627 --> 37:49.127
[SPEAKER_06]: I've done that.

37:49.507 --> 37:50.007
[SPEAKER_06]: It was fun.

37:50.347 --> 37:52.548
[SPEAKER_10]: The second one, you can do it really easily on.

37:52.908 --> 37:55.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn them for not making another game.

37:55.489 --> 38:00.851
[SPEAKER_10]: All you do is put it in whatever the easy one was, which is all arrows, and you can play it.

38:01.571 --> 38:02.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn them for not making another one.

38:26.798 --> 38:27.618
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop doing the role playing.

38:27.638 --> 38:34.661
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they just need to put up the whole AVEX side, you know, get AVEX back and do a whole new one.

38:34.901 --> 38:35.221
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

38:35.521 --> 38:37.942
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, a friend of mine once had an interesting perspective.

38:38.402 --> 38:44.624
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you guys know about this, but way back when they beta tested or location tested DDR4th Mix.

38:45.344 --> 38:52.767
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if it was location test or an early build of the game or what, but there was actually a song from the Dance Maniacs series, Eyes On Me.

38:53.570 --> 39:22.831
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course that's the theme song from Final Fantasy VIII but it was a dance mix of it that appeared on one of the Dance Maniacs albums I want to say like X5 or something I know there was one on Zipmania but I think it was the version pulled from like X5 or something and Eyes On Me was supposed to be in DDR4th Mix well it got pulled at the last minute and the rumor was that Square took issue with it so they just pulled the song but my friend kind of at the time was like well you know Square probably does that because if they wanted to do

39:23.661 --> 39:24.582
[SPEAKER_06]: Final Revolution

39:45.802 --> 39:52.506
[SPEAKER_10]: And you know, there was actually, because I have this game on Dreamcast, being the big Puyo Puyo nerd I am, I have Puyo Da.

39:53.387 --> 39:54.948
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember you showing that to me once.

39:55.453 --> 39:58.856
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's other style dance games Konami's not going to sue them over.

39:58.916 --> 40:02.399
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, Busta Groove Move and Puyo.

40:02.859 --> 40:07.563
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, Puyo Da was more like Busta Move, except you built up your combos.

40:08.484 --> 40:16.611
[SPEAKER_10]: And it worked sort of how you would do your drop on the other person by having a better combo than they did.

40:16.871 --> 40:19.634
[SPEAKER_10]: And you would cancel out each other's combos, sort of like when you're playing Puyo Puyo.

40:20.214 --> 40:20.715
[SPEAKER_10]: and so on.

40:37.409 --> 40:47.253
[SPEAKER_10]: The second Rival Schools game that they came out with in Japan, which was the Evolution one, had a sort of like Batsu breakdancing in it.

40:47.973 --> 40:49.554
[SPEAKER_10]: Had a DDR sort of mode in it.

40:49.634 --> 40:51.654
[SPEAKER_10]: More like you enter and the commands sort of like bust a move.

40:51.754 --> 40:52.735
[SPEAKER_10]: And Grand Theft Auto had that.

40:52.955 --> 40:54.636
[SPEAKER_10]: And Cardfighter Clash.

40:54.996 --> 40:55.736
[SPEAKER_10]: Not Cardfighter Clash.

40:56.016 --> 41:00.178
[SPEAKER_10]: The other Marvel Capcom... Not Marvel Capcom, um...

41:01.439 --> 41:11.091
[SPEAKER_10]: SNK Capcom on the Neo Geo had pretty much DDR in it.

41:12.112 --> 41:17.238
[SPEAKER_06]: There's an old-ass game, and I only know this game because it was my first DDR game I ever owned.

41:17.258 --> 41:18.099
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't really DDR.

41:18.119 --> 41:20.242
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my first dance game I ever owned.

41:20.635 --> 41:24.696
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the Jungle Book dancing game for the PlayStation.

41:24.996 --> 41:25.717
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember that.

41:25.757 --> 41:27.497
[SPEAKER_10]: I remember showing you Third Mix.

41:28.297 --> 41:33.399
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember the dance pad was like half the size of a normal dance pad because they make it for four-year-olds.

41:33.799 --> 41:39.621
[SPEAKER_06]: But here I am playing on this Jungle Book dance pad, and it actually had a whole little game that went with it.

41:40.121 --> 41:44.763
[SPEAKER_06]: The arrows were in little bubbles, and it was very, very similar to DER, except I think it went different.

41:45.723 --> 41:46.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Scroll down, but whatever.

41:47.464 --> 41:49.685
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, and all the music was from the Jungle Book.

41:49.945 --> 41:52.546
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to walk like you, talk like you, too.

41:53.026 --> 41:54.166
[SPEAKER_06]: It had all the little music in it.

41:54.747 --> 41:59.189
[SPEAKER_06]: And, like, Lubega had a video in it, and it was a bunch of little kids playing the game.

41:59.449 --> 42:02.350
[SPEAKER_06]: That was my first dance game for PlayStation.

42:02.870 --> 42:05.191
[SPEAKER_06]: And Konami never sued those guys for making that game.

42:05.211 --> 42:07.012
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it had Lubega in it.

42:08.152 --> 42:09.593
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that got to do with anything?

42:09.633 --> 42:10.193
[SPEAKER_12]: Games suck!

42:13.089 --> 42:20.334
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's actually very interesting because, you know, that's a Disney game, and then Konami actually ended up doing a Disney DDR that was released in America.

42:20.714 --> 42:22.435
[SPEAKER_06]: So, kind of interesting.

42:22.636 --> 42:24.977
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what music game I can't believe they have not made a sequel to?

42:25.558 --> 42:28.780
[SPEAKER_07]: Guitar Room N. I'm kind of surprised, too.

42:30.261 --> 42:31.081
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a great game.

42:31.502 --> 42:32.042
[SPEAKER_06]: They should do it.

42:32.614 --> 42:41.265
[SPEAKER_07]: It was pretty much all one band that did the music and then they had an outside artist come in and do all the graphics and the entire design for the game.

42:41.285 --> 42:44.409
[SPEAKER_07]: So that may be a part of the reason, but I don't know.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.692
[SPEAKER_07]: They should find a new band and a new artist or whatever.

42:47.574 --> 42:47.694
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

42:48.074 --> 42:48.274
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

42:48.695 --> 42:48.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

42:50.557 --> 42:50.838
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

42:51.993 --> 42:56.416
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we're going to go to a break, guys, and we're going to come back and talk about some more things going on in the DDR world.

42:57.597 --> 43:04.261
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this break, we're going to start playing some tracks from the brand new Ultramix 3 VRare, which came out this week.

43:04.301 --> 43:11.706
[SPEAKER_06]: In this break, we're going to hear Neveraka, who originally remixed the Day Behavior song Superstar in Ultramix 2.

43:11.766 --> 43:12.786
[SPEAKER_06]: They have their own song.

43:12.826 --> 43:13.847
[SPEAKER_06]: It's called Evolution.

43:14.247 --> 43:18.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the interesting thing about the Ultramix 3 VRare is that it has tracks from songpacks already.

43:19.211 --> 43:23.296
[SPEAKER_06]: So this first track is actually from Song Pack 14, so go figure.

43:23.897 --> 43:28.343
[SPEAKER_06]: Akira Yamaoka with Love This Feeling has been remixed by Zonk.

43:28.803 --> 43:32.147
[SPEAKER_06]: Zonk was the band that did Tittle Tattle in Ultramix 2, so it's a very...

43:33.616 --> 43:34.717
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to explain it.

43:34.757 --> 43:36.098
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a very kind of groovy version.

43:36.138 --> 43:36.818
[SPEAKER_06]: I love this feeling.

43:37.018 --> 43:49.225
[SPEAKER_06]: But the interesting thing is that, and they've kind of been picking at this on the DDR Freak forums, is that instead of remixing the Chang Ma version, it really sounds like they went back and remixed the Akira Yamaoka one from Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania.

43:49.405 --> 43:50.045
[SPEAKER_06]: Love this feeling.

43:50.085 --> 43:50.786
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of cool.

43:51.146 --> 43:51.906
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a good remix.

43:52.207 --> 43:58.330
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to hear Togo featuring Sana with Jelly Kiss, but it's Midihead's version, the Midihead Smack Mix remix.

43:58.590 --> 44:03.180
[SPEAKER_06]: and then the last track we're going to hear this break is Shontanix with Hash the Sun.

44:03.802 --> 44:05.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Brand new song we're going to have in DDR Ultimix 3.

44:06.147 --> 44:08.913
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

44:09.113 --> 44:09.354
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

44:39.579 --> 44:40.360
[SPEAKER_15]: Thanks for watching!

45:48.957 --> 45:50.106
Thank you for watching!

46:18.784 --> 46:19.347
and the others.

47:33.750 --> 48:00.331
Ah, he's my boy, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the love, the

48:51.185 --> 48:52.187
Thank you for watching

50:42.269 --> 50:42.991
Thanks for watching!

51:20.367 --> 51:26.228
[SPEAKER_18]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

51:28.868 --> 51:31.929
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what else Captain Jack told me?

51:32.069 --> 51:33.489
[SPEAKER_06]: Copy kills music.

51:33.969 --> 51:34.269
[SPEAKER_06]: It does.

51:35.309 --> 51:36.990
[SPEAKER_06]: You're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

51:37.050 --> 51:38.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight we're giving away free stuff.

51:39.602 --> 51:41.803
[SPEAKER_06]: The drawing's only probably about an hour away.

51:42.163 --> 51:43.624
[SPEAKER_06]: So make sure you get your emails in.

51:43.744 --> 51:45.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Freestuff at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

51:45.885 --> 51:50.007
[SPEAKER_06]: And to answer some questions from before, you don't have to put your address in the email.

51:50.027 --> 51:52.268
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you put it in there, we're not going to disqualify you or anything.

51:52.548 --> 51:55.049
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you send us two emails, you are going to get disqualified.

51:55.429 --> 51:56.550
[SPEAKER_06]: So send those in.

51:56.610 --> 51:58.071
[SPEAKER_06]: Freestuff at OrangeLawnTrader.com.

51:58.111 --> 52:00.032
[SPEAKER_06]: And what is the free stuff we're giving away tonight?

52:00.412 --> 52:07.215
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you win, and we'll have one listener during the live show tonight, and one winner sometime this week after the podcast,

52:07.535 --> 52:18.418
[SPEAKER_06]: You are going to win a pair of CDs, one of them being the DDR Max II V-Rare, which is kind of hard to find now, and the DDR EX II V-Rare, which if you didn't pre-order the game, you ain't going to get anywhere else.

52:18.818 --> 52:20.838
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to hook you up with those.

52:20.918 --> 52:32.701
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to copy authentic copies, sealed copies of DDR Max II and DDR EX II, and who knows, we might just, because we're loving and caring hosts, we might throw something else in the bag too.

52:33.339 --> 52:43.762
[SPEAKER_06]: But the one thing we will not be throwing in the bag will be a copy of In The Groove as defaced by Loki, DarkSakura, and I will be a lot more forgiving for In The Groove.

52:44.222 --> 52:47.323
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to deface it, but I will definitely do my part.

52:47.883 --> 52:49.663
[SPEAKER_22]: You're not going to throw $5 bills in with the viewers?

52:50.544 --> 52:51.264
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no money.

52:51.544 --> 52:51.924
[SPEAKER_06]: No money.

52:52.144 --> 52:53.344
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I don't have money.

52:53.644 --> 52:57.785
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know about DarkSakura and Loki, but even if I had money, I wouldn't give it to our listeners.

52:58.286 --> 52:58.706
[SPEAKER_06]: No offense.

52:58.866 --> 52:59.766
[SPEAKER_06]: Love you guys, but damn.

53:00.939 --> 53:05.281
[SPEAKER_22]: DarkSakura, I know you weren't too thrilled with a couple of those.

53:05.321 --> 53:08.683
[SPEAKER_22]: That version, I love that feeling, was crap disguised as a song.

53:28.058 --> 53:28.779
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what's interesting?

53:29.179 --> 53:31.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Very polarized reaction on DDR Freak.

53:31.422 --> 53:33.624
[SPEAKER_06]: I was reading on the forums over there, very polarized reaction.

53:33.664 --> 53:37.108
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people love it, and some people just think it is poop.

53:38.009 --> 53:39.830
[SPEAKER_10]: And also I don't like that version of Jelly Kiss either.

53:40.371 --> 53:41.973
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I really like the Jelly Kiss ones.

53:42.393 --> 53:44.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not that big on the love this feeling mix.

53:44.736 --> 53:47.619
[SPEAKER_10]: I like Zonk, but... And the first one was very generic.

53:48.039 --> 53:50.722
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, photocopy generic.

53:51.525 --> 53:52.686
[SPEAKER_06]: The ferret is being requested.

53:53.026 --> 53:54.287
[SPEAKER_22]: The ferret is being requested?

53:54.427 --> 53:55.608
[SPEAKER_22]: The ferret is being requested.

53:55.768 --> 53:58.791
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get out the ferret and take care of that request.

53:59.812 --> 54:00.632
[SPEAKER_06]: Where is the ferret?

54:01.553 --> 54:02.974
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the ferret's went off to breed.

54:04.295 --> 54:04.896
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably.

54:05.416 --> 54:06.437
[SPEAKER_06]: It was around here somewhere.

54:07.277 --> 54:10.140
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll look for the ferret and try to get the ferret in on the show a little later.

54:12.141 --> 54:15.444
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell if I know where those things went off to.

54:15.784 --> 54:18.847
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll keep looking for it during the next break and try to get an appearance by the ferret.

54:19.287 --> 54:20.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you know what reminds me, though?

54:21.235 --> 54:22.196
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

54:40.640 --> 54:46.264
[SPEAKER_06]: The weird thing is that there's a site out there that links to us as a news source.

54:46.284 --> 54:50.286
[SPEAKER_06]: They have all these RSS feeds, and we're one of them as a news source.

54:51.207 --> 54:53.929
[SPEAKER_06]: The site is ferretmarketing.com.

54:53.949 --> 54:56.990
[SPEAKER_06]: It has us as a news source.

54:57.731 --> 54:59.972
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys don't believe me, look at this right here in studio.

54:59.992 --> 55:01.533
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I'll even post this in chat.

55:01.914 --> 55:03.975
[SPEAKER_06]: This poor site's going to get hammered, but I don't care.

55:04.435 --> 55:05.816
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to post this in chat.

55:07.179 --> 55:07.679
[SPEAKER_06]: Check us out.

55:07.779 --> 55:08.680
[SPEAKER_06]: Ferret Marketing.

55:08.920 --> 55:09.460
[SPEAKER_06]: And here we are.

55:09.540 --> 55:14.082
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's the URL for the awesome new source, OrangeLaunchRadio.com, and it shows our latest headlines.

55:14.922 --> 55:18.464
[SPEAKER_06]: Why we are on FerretMarketing.com, I have no idea.

55:18.584 --> 55:19.644
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you mentioned ferrets.

55:19.685 --> 55:21.765
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a ferret fan that's listening to this show.

55:22.626 --> 55:24.006
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are pretty damn cute ferrets.

55:24.567 --> 55:26.087
[SPEAKER_06]: They are cute ferrets that are on the page.

55:26.307 --> 55:28.548
[SPEAKER_08]: I have no idea what the... I know.

55:28.668 --> 55:29.289
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll look for it.

55:29.489 --> 55:29.769
[SPEAKER_06]: It might...

55:31.198 --> 55:33.719
[SPEAKER_06]: There's probably some in a box over there, so I'll dig through them on the next break.

55:34.800 --> 55:39.142
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Loki's currently defacing the copy of In the Groove that we're going to give away.

55:39.622 --> 55:40.082
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm helping.

55:40.302 --> 55:40.763
[SPEAKER_06]: What have you done?

55:40.903 --> 55:43.024
[SPEAKER_06]: I assure you... Wait, what did you write on the manual here?

55:43.824 --> 55:46.325
[SPEAKER_06]: I assure you this is not DDR, okay?

55:47.646 --> 55:48.706
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you write on the cover there?

55:48.806 --> 55:51.567
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what Loki wrote on the cover there, of In the Groove there.

55:52.108 --> 55:54.989
[SPEAKER_06]: This game sucks monkey balls, and then signed it by Loki.

55:55.009 --> 55:55.749
[SPEAKER_06]: That was very polite.

55:55.769 --> 55:57.170
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, good job.

55:57.611 --> 55:59.892
[SPEAKER_10]: I found a book called 500 Things My Ferret Told Me.

56:01.813 --> 56:02.293
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me guess.

56:11.357 --> 56:17.039
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you are an In The Groove fan listening to this program and getting pissed off, it's just a game.

56:17.259 --> 56:18.039
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a game, people.

56:18.419 --> 56:18.860
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a game.

56:19.140 --> 56:19.980
[SPEAKER_06]: We have the right to our opinion.

56:20.600 --> 56:21.621
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think it sucks.

56:22.523 --> 56:25.766
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do, I look forward to new DDR mixes more than I do in a game.

56:25.926 --> 56:28.809
[SPEAKER_06]: I had people go, why are you ruining such a perfect, that's stupid.

56:28.849 --> 56:30.611
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, because I can.

56:32.373 --> 56:34.755
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly, so if you... If I was given a free iPod...

56:35.680 --> 56:40.182
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd probably break it, but then if I didn't break it, I would give it away and do the exact same thing.

56:40.322 --> 56:47.025
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so if you're wondering why are you bastards writing all over a copy of In the Groove and giving it away.

56:47.045 --> 56:52.208
[SPEAKER_06]: I personally bought this copy, okay, so my money was spent on this copy that I am sending out.

56:52.248 --> 57:02.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so if it makes you feel better, In the Groove fans, Loki spent money, so he's essentially supporting In the Groove, but because he doesn't like it, he's turning it over to an In the Groove fan.

57:02.353 --> 57:03.933
[SPEAKER_06]: And what better charity than that, huh?

57:04.274 --> 57:04.914
[SPEAKER_06]: So stop bitching.

57:07.679 --> 57:09.822
[SPEAKER_06]: We will get some pics of the DeFesta in the groove.

57:10.182 --> 57:13.526
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not by the end of the show, but a little later on in the program.

57:14.026 --> 57:15.768
[SPEAKER_06]: A little later on in the week.

57:18.351 --> 57:19.773
[SPEAKER_06]: What were the ferrets called, Lokis?

57:19.853 --> 57:20.734
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our chatters, I think.

57:20.754 --> 57:21.775
[SPEAKER_06]: Scoozies.

57:22.116 --> 57:23.878
[SPEAKER_10]: But I don't remember exactly how it's spelled.

57:23.898 --> 57:24.579
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like S-C-O-O-Z-I-E-S.

57:27.967 --> 57:29.308
[SPEAKER_06]: I came up with something completely different.

57:29.709 --> 57:30.209
[SPEAKER_06]: I can hold on.

57:30.229 --> 57:30.730
[SPEAKER_06]: I can find it.

57:30.770 --> 57:33.393
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a whole website and a mini web game they can play.

57:33.613 --> 57:34.694
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it adult oriented?

57:34.714 --> 57:38.898
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I bet scoozies would be a pretty X-rated term for some genitalia if you think about it.

57:42.381 --> 57:43.423
[SPEAKER_06]: Show them your scoozie.

57:43.443 --> 57:46.886
[SPEAKER_10]: You mean, what was it?

57:47.066 --> 57:47.987
[SPEAKER_10]: S-C-Z-Y?

57:49.288 --> 57:49.649
[SPEAKER_10]: Scuzzy.

57:50.389 --> 57:51.631
[SPEAKER_06]: No, scuzzy is a little different there.

57:53.555 --> 57:54.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, let's see.

57:54.455 --> 57:55.976
[SPEAKER_06]: So moving on, I want to talk about some other things.

57:55.996 --> 58:04.998
[SPEAKER_06]: Some things that people were talking about before the show, and I actually can't say I'm really up to date on what's going on here, so I'm hoping somebody might call in the skyplane later and clear up the air on what's going on.

58:06.138 --> 58:09.799
[SPEAKER_06]: But I guess there's going to be some type of DDR thing on MTV.

58:10.939 --> 58:12.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just any MTV, but MTV2.

58:14.778 --> 58:16.999
[SPEAKER_06]: MTV2, of course.

58:17.239 --> 58:26.124
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember when MTV2 first launched, it was supposed to be, oh, since MTV, we're freely admitting, is not a music-oriented station anymore, MTV2 is where we're going to play all the videos.

58:26.504 --> 58:28.125
[SPEAKER_06]: It's where MTV goes to die.

58:28.405 --> 58:28.785
[SPEAKER_06]: Basically.

58:28.825 --> 58:29.325
[SPEAKER_06]: But guess what?

58:29.405 --> 58:31.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, on MTV2, they don't just play videos anymore.

58:31.827 --> 58:32.507
[SPEAKER_06]: They play other crap.

58:32.547 --> 58:35.008
[SPEAKER_06]: They play old episodes of real world stuff.

58:35.428 --> 58:35.608
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

58:37.690 --> 58:47.853
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our listeners, Sephiroth1215, on our web forums actually wrote, I was randomly watching that video mod show yesterday, and they showed a preview for the new episode that will be on Friday.

58:48.393 --> 58:51.914
[SPEAKER_06]: This preview mentioned DDR being featured for a video.

58:52.574 --> 58:53.854
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's about time they did this.

58:53.934 --> 58:55.015
[SPEAKER_06]: It only seems to make sense.

58:55.115 --> 58:57.115
[SPEAKER_06]: Perfect for the time for the new release, I guess.

58:58.055 --> 58:59.656
[SPEAKER_10]: Other than in everything but the girl video?

59:00.236 --> 59:04.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if you actually have seen, if you played 2DX3rdStyle,

59:05.524 --> 59:14.830
[SPEAKER_06]: and played Five Fathoms, you can actually see an old-ass version of DDR, like butterfly old-ass version of DDR in the video.

59:14.950 --> 59:18.572
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see a five key, like they're playing Jam Jam Reggae in the video or something.

59:19.033 --> 59:20.033
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of cute.

59:24.656 --> 59:25.377
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think?

59:26.357 --> 59:30.280
[SPEAKER_06]: MTV going to be on, or DDR going to be on MTV?

59:31.161 --> 59:33.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing for the community, bad thing for the community.

59:33.582 --> 59:34.302
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't give a shit.

59:34.342 --> 59:34.963
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

59:34.983 --> 59:37.804
[SPEAKER_10]: That means DDR has jumped the shark.

59:37.924 --> 59:39.244
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR has officially jumped the shark?

59:39.744 --> 59:41.565
[SPEAKER_06]: So, does this mean you're an In the Groove fan now?

59:42.346 --> 59:42.906
[SPEAKER_10]: Fuck no.

59:43.926 --> 59:47.247
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, if the original has jumped the shark, why would I go for a pale imitation?

59:49.688 --> 59:50.449
[SPEAKER_06]: How about Dance Praise?

59:50.489 --> 59:51.209
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that jump the shark?

59:53.010 --> 59:53.870
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the shark.

59:55.111 --> 59:55.471
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugged.

59:56.571 --> 59:57.992
[SPEAKER_06]: Your thoughts, DDR on MTV.

59:58.052 --> 59:59.472
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing, bad thing, I don't give a shit.

59:59.773 --> 01:00:00.393
[SPEAKER_22]: Don't give a shit.

01:00:01.469 --> 01:00:02.690
[SPEAKER_22]: It's on MTV2.

01:00:02.730 --> 01:00:04.251
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't even get MTV fucking 2.

01:00:06.892 --> 01:00:08.893
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, a pop music whore.

01:00:09.333 --> 01:00:10.294
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR on MTV.

01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:11.074
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't give a shit.

01:00:15.516 --> 01:00:16.697
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess it's a good thing.

01:00:16.817 --> 01:00:17.557
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a good thing.

01:00:18.358 --> 01:00:23.800
[SPEAKER_06]: More exposure for DDR, despite how we might think MTV2 is just stupid.

01:00:25.241 --> 01:00:30.844
[SPEAKER_06]: More exposure for DDR means more copies of the game get sold, means we get an EX3 next year, right?

01:00:33.728 --> 01:00:34.530
[SPEAKER_06]: I say it's a good thing.

01:00:34.971 --> 01:00:38.518
[SPEAKER_06]: Any exposure is a good thing if more people buy copies of it.

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:44.874
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody in the chat room is saying, I would love to see In the Groove on MTV.

01:00:45.254 --> 01:00:52.937
[SPEAKER_06]: And I have to say, when I was at E3, we were actually downstairs in Kensho Hall, where Red Octane had a booth, and they had In the Groove set up.

01:00:52.957 --> 01:00:56.259
[SPEAKER_06]: They didn't have it even set up the first day, but I think this was the last day of the show.

01:00:57.339 --> 01:01:05.803
[SPEAKER_06]: Myself, and I don't know if you guys remember from the old Wednesday show, Rice, Princess, and Lanky Style, we were down there in Kensho Hall, and...

01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.603
[SPEAKER_06]: We were at the In The Groove showing and MTV came by and filmed this guy very randomly playing.

01:01:12.643 --> 01:01:14.965
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for pulling out my Dreamcast out of a box.

01:01:16.546 --> 01:01:20.348
[SPEAKER_06]: MTV came by and was very randomly filming somebody playing In The Groove.

01:01:20.648 --> 01:01:23.910
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was for like an MTV.com series.

01:01:24.270 --> 01:01:30.114
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I thought was interesting is that one of the hosts was Chi-Lon Liu and then some guy from Road Rules.

01:01:30.134 --> 01:01:30.694
[SPEAKER_06]: But Chi-Lon...

01:01:31.317 --> 01:01:44.570
[SPEAKER_06]: was, um, you remember right before the screensavers went kaput and changed into Attack of the Show, they had Qi Lan on there, and she was kind of, uh, now, if you really want to see, if you want to really see what a giggling girl is, it's Qi Lan.

01:01:45.311 --> 01:01:53.679
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and, you know, I know that sometimes that phrase is overused, but in her case, it really was true.

01:01:54.419 --> 01:01:55.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so...

01:01:57.697 --> 01:02:00.623
[SPEAKER_06]: But she's still doing things for MTV, it looks like.

01:02:02.407 --> 01:02:02.848
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting.

01:02:03.910 --> 01:02:04.972
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were doing In the Groove.

01:02:05.373 --> 01:02:07.858
[SPEAKER_06]: So in some way it would have been on MTV, I suppose.

01:02:09.733 --> 01:02:12.375
[SPEAKER_06]: So of course, EX2 is coming out this week.

01:02:12.435 --> 01:02:13.716
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious what you guys think.

01:02:13.796 --> 01:02:16.677
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys ready to pick this game up, or do you not care?

01:02:17.258 --> 01:02:19.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you done with DDR home mixes?

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:20.480
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think?

01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:25.863
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm curious to hear from you, Garrett, because you are mostly an import gaming horn.

01:02:25.883 --> 01:02:28.505
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't buy a whole lot of the US games, do you?

01:02:28.525 --> 01:02:29.585
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think you really do.

01:02:29.685 --> 01:02:33.508
[SPEAKER_07]: Not as many as I... Well, actually, I don't buy a whole lot of games, period, anymore.

01:02:34.008 --> 01:02:38.391
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what it is, but I lost interest of the US DDRs after...

01:02:39.281 --> 01:02:42.323
[SPEAKER_07]: Max 1 or 2, you know, for the US.

01:02:42.843 --> 01:02:51.309
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a song that's just regurgitated from, you know, okay, random transplants with crappy steps or songs that I already had in other versions.

01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:52.470
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, it's kind of pointless.

01:02:52.810 --> 01:02:56.973
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like, Ultramix stuff looked interesting, but I don't care to get an Xbox.

01:02:57.653 --> 01:02:59.835
[SPEAKER_07]: So, there's my feelings on that.

01:03:00.455 --> 01:03:02.317
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you're probably not going to buy EX2?

01:03:02.937 --> 01:03:05.339
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the down arrow on my red octane pad is broken.

01:03:05.519 --> 01:03:05.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

01:03:07.423 --> 01:03:07.723
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:03:08.644 --> 01:03:11.285
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, I'm kind of curious, what are your thoughts about EX2?

01:03:11.425 --> 01:03:13.246
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm probably getting it free, so I don't care.

01:03:14.146 --> 01:03:15.187
[SPEAKER_06]: But are you excited about it?

01:03:15.247 --> 01:03:15.927
[SPEAKER_06]: Could you care less?

01:03:16.147 --> 01:03:16.487
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it?

01:03:16.807 --> 01:03:24.671
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really have working pads, so, I mean, well, I have working pads, I just haven't, you know, gotten them so that they're not, you know, breaking all the time.

01:03:25.111 --> 01:03:27.773
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I guess it's cool.

01:03:27.953 --> 01:03:32.595
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I don't play DDR really right now, other than, you know, just Step Mania stuff.

01:03:33.435 --> 01:03:36.837
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really, the setup that I have in the house right now is not conducive to DDR.

01:03:37.304 --> 01:03:39.446
[SPEAKER_06]: So, unfortunately.

01:03:40.547 --> 01:03:41.288
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it's cool.

01:03:41.588 --> 01:03:43.811
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I can't wait to see what else they've got on there.

01:03:44.251 --> 01:03:46.553
[SPEAKER_06]: Like all the new songs and remixes and fun stuff.

01:03:47.815 --> 01:03:51.158
[SPEAKER_06]: And thank God they haven't spoiled it yet, so it'll be good.

01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:55.062
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't like the fact that they had hints last time, so.

01:03:56.854 --> 01:04:07.417
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts about EX2, because you started DDR way back in the day, so you've seen this game really change, as have really all of us, but I know you've been on board for a long time.

01:04:08.057 --> 01:04:16.419
[SPEAKER_10]: I think I'm going to get it, just because I'm also planning on finally throwing down a little bit of money and getting an ignition pad, because I want to play at home some more.

01:04:17.459 --> 01:04:24.101
[SPEAKER_10]: But other than that, I'm not too excited about it, and the music isn't all that exciting anymore.

01:04:25.940 --> 01:04:31.883
[SPEAKER_10]: If I get something other than recycled, puked trance, it's the only way I can describe it.

01:04:32.563 --> 01:04:38.026
[SPEAKER_10]: Someone took generic trance, put it on a photocopier, and said, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song.

01:04:38.806 --> 01:04:44.229
[SPEAKER_10]: I want a DDR with good music, with real music in it.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:53.093
[SPEAKER_10]: I love all the Konami originals, all those are great, but if they're going to bring in something new, bring in something innovative.

01:04:53.453 --> 01:04:54.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Throw us a freaking bone here.

01:04:54.613 --> 01:04:55.233
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of stuff?

01:04:55.353 --> 01:04:56.614
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of music would make you happy?

01:04:56.954 --> 01:04:57.274
[SPEAKER_10]: Blur.

01:04:57.634 --> 01:04:58.974
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean it.

01:04:59.114 --> 01:04:59.635
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I see.

01:05:00.255 --> 01:05:01.855
[SPEAKER_06]: You want feel-good ink in DDR.

01:05:02.615 --> 01:05:03.275
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not blur.

01:05:03.295 --> 01:05:03.836
[SPEAKER_06]: That's gorillas.

01:05:04.336 --> 01:05:05.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know, but still.

01:05:05.776 --> 01:05:08.697
[SPEAKER_10]: But I do want something that's got more substance to it.

01:05:09.077 --> 01:05:18.179
[SPEAKER_10]: Something other than the, you know, just... Not all music you can dance to is the techno-y stuff.

01:05:18.559 --> 01:05:26.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Out of curiosity, how do you feel about the Unleashed and Dancing Stage games, the Europe ones that have the British Britpop songs in them and stuff?

01:05:26.721 --> 01:05:27.541
[SPEAKER_10]: That makes me happy.

01:05:28.661 --> 01:05:40.083
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I don't really care about the Uberpop, but just that it seems like it's trying to cater more toward a broader scope of music, I think.

01:05:40.103 --> 01:05:40.663
[SPEAKER_10]: Trying to...

01:05:44.929 --> 01:05:46.651
[SPEAKER_10]: I need to just make my own DDR mix.

01:05:50.469 --> 01:06:01.098
[SPEAKER_06]: In America, even if you're a fan of the American DDRs, even if you're a fan of the Japanese home DDR mixes, almost everybody agrees that the British folks get really good songs.

01:06:01.518 --> 01:06:02.539
[SPEAKER_06]: They get really good mixes.

01:06:02.579 --> 01:06:13.768
[SPEAKER_10]: There's actually an interesting thread on DDR Freak, because I mod the UK forum, saying, you know, I sort of like talking about which one would you more prefer.

01:06:13.948 --> 01:06:15.650
[SPEAKER_10]: There's been a discussion in this one thread.

01:06:16.450 --> 01:06:33.125
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll try to hunt it down and get more info out of it but it was really kind of interesting seeing who would want what out of what mix and seeing that there was sort of on the other side that they want some of what we get but I don't see why.

01:06:34.921 --> 01:06:36.543
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of what we get is kind of cool, though.

01:06:37.904 --> 01:06:43.929
[SPEAKER_10]: I honestly thought that the last release was so much better, you know, with Skulk and all that.

01:06:43.969 --> 01:06:44.570
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Ultramix 2?

01:06:44.650 --> 01:06:44.970
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 2.

01:06:45.130 --> 01:06:47.232
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and I think Ultramix 3 is going to be pretty good, too.

01:06:47.252 --> 01:06:55.400
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know you didn't like those particular songs, but if you remember the Ultramix 1 VRare, it didn't have a whole lot of what the game really had in store, so we'll see.

01:06:55.720 --> 01:06:59.182
[SPEAKER_10]: But I haven't heard anything that's excited me yet.

01:06:59.222 --> 01:07:05.924
[SPEAKER_10]: In fact, just what we played in the break, the last break, really made me sad.

01:07:06.205 --> 01:07:08.065
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we're about to get to another break pretty soon here.

01:07:08.085 --> 01:07:09.326
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to hear four more songs.

01:07:09.446 --> 01:07:10.786
[SPEAKER_06]: One of them is a classical remix.

01:07:10.867 --> 01:07:12.227
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if you'll dig that or not.

01:07:12.267 --> 01:07:12.607
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:07:13.127 --> 01:07:14.168
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get to that.

01:07:14.188 --> 01:07:15.709
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, I think we'll get to it right now.

01:07:15.989 --> 01:07:16.449
[SPEAKER_06]: How's that sound?

01:07:16.649 --> 01:07:16.989
[SPEAKER_10]: Yay!

01:07:17.129 --> 01:07:17.369
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:07:17.389 --> 01:07:19.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Then when we come back, we're going to do the Skype line.

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:23.552
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy's going to call in and he's going to talk about...

01:07:23.932 --> 01:07:28.353
[SPEAKER_06]: A brand new Konami-related CD that came out this week, so we're going to talk about that.

01:07:28.973 --> 01:07:30.233
[SPEAKER_06]: And at least I think it was this week.

01:07:30.914 --> 01:07:31.234
[SPEAKER_06]: I think so.

01:07:32.314 --> 01:07:33.474
[SPEAKER_06]: If not, he'll correct me on it, I'm sure.

01:07:34.974 --> 01:07:36.255
[SPEAKER_06]: And some more stuff when we come back.

01:07:36.275 --> 01:07:39.055
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do the Cage Match sometime during this next segment as well.

01:07:39.535 --> 01:07:42.656
[SPEAKER_06]: And the rest of your calls on the Skype line when we come back after this.

01:07:43.196 --> 01:07:46.777
[SPEAKER_06]: So in this break, let's see what songs we're going to hear here.

01:07:47.997 --> 01:07:50.598
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to do, starting it off...

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:57.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Mo-Shik with Moment 40 will be the first song that we hear, and I believe this is the one that's a bit of a classical song remix, so we'll hear that.

01:07:58.695 --> 01:08:03.518
[SPEAKER_06]: DJ Taka, Colors, but remixed by Midihead, so that should be interesting.

01:08:04.338 --> 01:08:10.202
[SPEAKER_06]: John D. and Spesh have done a version of By La Lakia, Carried With The Wind, and it's very interesting.

01:08:10.222 --> 01:08:16.625
[SPEAKER_06]: You might remember John D. and Spesh did the Max 300 remix from Ultramix 2, so that'll definitely be very interesting to hear.

01:08:17.066 --> 01:08:20.988
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to hear Big Idea with Danza De Yucca.

01:08:21.508 --> 01:08:28.252
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Idea is the one that did Baile La Samba and ToeJam, which made its way into 2DX.

01:08:28.332 --> 01:08:28.832
[SPEAKER_06]: Happy Sky.

01:08:28.852 --> 01:08:31.133
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't think of ToeJam without thinking of ToeJam and Earl.

01:08:31.533 --> 01:08:31.853
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:08:31.913 --> 01:08:32.514
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, me neither.

01:08:32.954 --> 01:08:36.476
[SPEAKER_22]: It's just because you're a Sega whore, and so are you, and that's okay, because Sega's a good thing.

01:08:37.176 --> 01:08:40.158
[SPEAKER_22]: I can reach behind me and pull Segas out of your closet.

01:08:40.198 --> 01:08:40.918
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

01:08:41.338 --> 01:08:42.759
[SPEAKER_06]: I keep all my Segas in the closet.

01:08:43.559 --> 01:08:45.020
[SPEAKER_22]: They're trapped in the closet.

01:08:46.381 --> 01:08:47.221
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be back after this.

01:08:47.261 --> 01:08:48.462
[SPEAKER_06]: Start it off with Moshik, Moment 40.

01:08:49.202 --> 01:08:51.661
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 3 VRare here tonight on Orange Lingerie.

01:10:34.944 --> 01:10:36.585
Thank you for watching!

01:13:05.202 --> 01:13:06.387
Thank you for watching!

01:16:12.133 --> 01:16:12.993
[SPEAKER_06]: Oop, dead air there.

01:16:13.093 --> 01:16:13.594
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry guys.

01:16:13.874 --> 01:16:19.557
[SPEAKER_06]: We forgot to put a little, I should say I forgot to put a little sweeper coming back.

01:16:19.637 --> 01:16:23.919
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was too busy doing my own spin on defacing the copy of In the Groove here.

01:16:24.659 --> 01:16:26.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm actually writing in the table of contents right now.

01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:30.182
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually added something to the table of contents in the instruction manual.

01:16:30.202 --> 01:16:32.463
[SPEAKER_06]: I put how to get sued on page 69.

01:16:33.303 --> 01:16:33.803
[SPEAKER_06]: How to get sued.

01:16:34.143 --> 01:16:35.384
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I'm putting contents.

01:16:35.424 --> 01:16:36.465
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm writing next to contents.

01:16:36.805 --> 01:16:39.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Contents of my ass.

01:16:39.186 --> 01:16:41.327
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to put contents of my ass.

01:16:41.721 --> 01:16:44.480
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm putting special, really crappy artwork in the inside cover.

01:16:45.717 --> 01:16:50.019
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, this is us defacing in the groove because we can.

01:16:50.979 --> 01:16:56.682
[SPEAKER_06]: And to whoever wins this, DarkSakura is leaving a very special message and some artwork in there.

01:16:57.702 --> 01:17:03.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside the art, like you would have to pull out the insert to see it on the inside.

01:17:03.705 --> 01:17:05.466
[SPEAKER_06]: So whoever wins this is really going to enjoy this.

01:17:05.906 --> 01:17:07.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of winning things... Here, Loki, I don't want this anymore.

01:17:08.527 --> 01:17:13.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of winning things, you this week... Yeah, you guys need to sign it too.

01:17:13.209 --> 01:17:14.350
[SPEAKER_06]: We're also going to have Bugged and...

01:17:14.971 --> 01:17:16.865
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, our Papa Music Corps, leave their mark on it.

01:17:19.332 --> 01:17:20.133
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:17:45.015 --> 01:17:46.616
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:18:19.304 --> 01:18:23.047
[SPEAKER_06]: And just so you know, we're not all in the groove haters.

01:18:23.167 --> 01:18:25.229
[SPEAKER_06]: I realize DarkSakura and Loki are in the groove haters.

01:18:25.409 --> 01:18:31.634
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually wrote my defacing, the other thing I did, I wrote on the title, it says in the groove, I put, is okay.

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:34.316
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I drew a little unemotional face.

01:18:34.496 --> 01:18:35.777
[SPEAKER_06]: So I put, in the groove is okay.

01:18:36.878 --> 01:18:38.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's how I feel, in the groove is okay.

01:18:38.359 --> 01:18:39.940
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:18:43.021 --> 01:18:43.441
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

01:19:04.262 --> 01:19:05.443
[SPEAKER_06]: Neil, you're a bastard.

01:19:05.483 --> 01:19:05.923
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

01:19:06.423 --> 01:19:06.703
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:19:07.543 --> 01:19:08.284
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just too quick.

01:19:08.324 --> 01:19:08.664
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.

01:19:08.704 --> 01:19:12.205
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I intentionally am bringing this call to the front because I want to speak to this person.

01:19:12.245 --> 01:19:12.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, you there?

01:19:15.166 --> 01:19:15.646
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, shit.

01:19:15.686 --> 01:19:16.347
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, you there?

01:19:17.607 --> 01:19:18.207
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hear me?

01:19:18.948 --> 01:19:19.528
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't do it.

01:19:19.608 --> 01:19:20.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, slow.

01:19:21.048 --> 01:19:22.389
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, it's very slow.

01:19:22.489 --> 01:19:24.410
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that stinks.

01:19:25.390 --> 01:19:25.710
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:27.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, I'm going to try calling you.

01:19:27.831 --> 01:19:28.551
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm going to call again.

01:19:28.791 --> 01:19:30.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I'm going to call you.

01:19:30.970 --> 01:19:32.711
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope he heard that, that I'm going to call him.

01:19:33.092 --> 01:19:34.052
[SPEAKER_06]: See if we have a little better luck.

01:19:34.553 --> 01:19:36.574
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to turn off my pornography torrents.

01:19:38.776 --> 01:19:40.137
[SPEAKER_06]: That is an annoying ass ring.

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:44.240
[SPEAKER_06]: Two ringing dings.

01:19:44.400 --> 01:19:51.165
[SPEAKER_06]: The rest of you guys that are trying to call in right now, call back in a little bit, because we wanted to bring this call to the front, because he actually has a contribution to make to tonight's show.

01:19:52.546 --> 01:19:56.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that the rest of you don't have contributions to make to tonight's show, but this is, you know, super important.

01:19:57.690 --> 01:19:58.330
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, shit!

01:19:59.071 --> 01:20:00.352
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just ringing and ringing and ringing.

01:20:02.651 --> 01:20:09.555
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Siggy's gonna actually just restart his PC, so we're gonna let him restart his PC and we'll take another call in the meantime.

01:20:12.236 --> 01:20:12.797
[SPEAKER_06]: Zaku.

01:20:13.697 --> 01:20:14.397
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up, man?

01:20:14.517 --> 01:20:15.318
[SPEAKER_06]: You lucked out.

01:20:15.598 --> 01:20:20.801
[SPEAKER_06]: The other call, I had to drop it and push it back to later because the connection's slow, so you get to be first tonight.

01:20:21.607 --> 01:20:22.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Wee!

01:20:22.608 --> 01:20:23.329
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

01:20:24.110 --> 01:20:25.352
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, uh, let me see.

01:20:25.372 --> 01:20:28.956
[SPEAKER_09]: DDR Extreme 2 coming out in two days, and... Did you enter the contest?

01:20:30.558 --> 01:20:32.280
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, yeah, I entered the VRare one.

01:20:32.380 --> 01:20:32.701
[SPEAKER_09]: Good man.

01:20:34.035 --> 01:20:38.997
[SPEAKER_09]: and basically MTV2 whoring the shit out of DDR Extreme 2 via video mods.

01:20:39.197 --> 01:20:40.718
[SPEAKER_09]: Yo, what is this video mod show now?

01:20:40.738 --> 01:20:42.519
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't watch MTV2, so you gotta tell me.

01:20:43.019 --> 01:20:52.424
[SPEAKER_09]: Basically, video mods is a show, is an MTV2 show where they take video game characters and make them reenact music videos, you know, from Main Street Music.

01:20:52.744 --> 01:20:55.285
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, fuck, it's that show that's gonna have DDR?

01:20:55.825 --> 01:20:59.166
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, the only one I've ever seen of that is The Sims dancing to Hey Yah.

01:20:59.206 --> 01:21:15.393
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, and my best bet is that they're gonna make, you know, they're gonna make all, you know, all the DDR2 characters dance to Sean Paul's Get Busy, which is the only mainstream track that, you know, Joe Sixpack probably knows, and, you know, probably the rest of America knows.

01:21:16.573 --> 01:21:21.515
[SPEAKER_09]: Who else in America would know about My My My or Silence, for that matter?

01:21:22.487 --> 01:21:28.652
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, Silence I could see, but what I remember from the Silence video, it wasn't really anything all that.

01:21:28.692 --> 01:21:30.074
[SPEAKER_06]: So I could see the Get Busy video.

01:21:30.774 --> 01:21:31.875
[SPEAKER_09]: It's going to be Get Busy.

01:21:33.156 --> 01:21:35.218
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm betting everything on it, without a shadow of a doubt.

01:21:35.278 --> 01:21:36.479
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how MTV is.

01:21:36.979 --> 01:21:38.541
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it could be something from Extreme 1.

01:21:39.725 --> 01:21:40.765
[SPEAKER_09]: No, they're going to use Xtreme 2.

01:21:42.046 --> 01:21:45.807
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell you right now, that's the most recent game.

01:21:46.167 --> 01:21:47.167
[SPEAKER_09]: MTV's not stupid.

01:21:47.187 --> 01:21:48.408
[SPEAKER_09]: They're going to whore out the game.

01:21:49.608 --> 01:21:56.470
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll just have to wait until Friday to see MTV.

01:21:56.490 --> 01:21:57.831
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make some money on that, Wager?

01:21:59.171 --> 01:22:00.072
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

01:22:01.133 --> 01:22:11.502
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I am going to have an extra Max 2 VRare after these contests, so maybe I should offer to send Zaku the Max 2 VRare if I'm wrong.

01:22:11.982 --> 01:22:13.183
[SPEAKER_06]: Nah, that would be too nice of me to do.

01:22:13.263 --> 01:22:13.664
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry, Zaku.

01:22:15.899 --> 01:22:27.464
[SPEAKER_09]: Also, you already know by now that the Ultramix 3 V-Ray revealed a few songs that might be in the game, like 250 BPM, Looney Tunes, in the medley.

01:22:27.784 --> 01:22:31.906
[SPEAKER_06]: The medley that's at the end, that has a bunch of remixes of songs that are going to be in songpacks?

01:22:32.326 --> 01:22:35.627
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it possibly does reveal songs that will be in the game.

01:22:36.088 --> 01:22:40.149
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, it's not for sure, but typically, songpacks every mix.

01:22:41.850 --> 01:22:51.780
[SPEAKER_09]: This is kind of like retribution for the fact that Info was leaked last year with Ultramix 2, so I guess Konami's trying to sneak in a few hints for those who know enough to realize them.

01:22:52.720 --> 01:22:53.321
[SPEAKER_06]: Possibly.

01:22:53.461 --> 01:22:58.005
[SPEAKER_06]: I honestly think Love Me Do is a shoo-in, because the folks at Konami know

01:23:01.294 --> 01:23:05.177
[SPEAKER_06]: that we are a big Akira Yamaoka whores and all his songs do very well in the DDR games.

01:23:05.498 --> 01:23:08.840
[SPEAKER_06]: So he has to have something in Extreme.

01:23:09.261 --> 01:23:13.244
[SPEAKER_09]: The question is, do the higher-ups of Konami really listen to the station?

01:23:14.325 --> 01:23:18.889
[SPEAKER_09]: Besides people who work as beta testers slash step-makers.

01:23:19.870 --> 01:23:21.111
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the ones above them.

01:23:21.511 --> 01:23:27.456
[SPEAKER_09]: Are they the ones listening and trying to reflect and pretty much take DDR into that form?

01:23:27.797 --> 01:23:28.077
[SPEAKER_08]: Mm-hmm.

01:23:29.400 --> 01:23:29.701
[SPEAKER_08]: Hmm.

01:23:30.865 --> 01:23:32.429
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, alright.

01:23:32.690 --> 01:23:34.155
[SPEAKER_09]: Anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

01:23:35.381 --> 01:23:38.143
[SPEAKER_09]: GameStop and the other places are still showing Beatmania U.S.

01:23:38.183 --> 01:23:53.334
[SPEAKER_09]: as November 1st as a release date I can tell you that's a load of crap I assure you it will not be November 1st I'm saying the same thing too right now I don't know why they can't get it to their Who needs to be schooled on this, Zaku?

01:23:54.755 --> 01:24:00.820
[SPEAKER_06]: EB EB Games needs to be schooled EB Games needs to be schooled on the release date of Beatmania U.S.A.

01:24:01.340 --> 01:24:02.501
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to push it by a few months.

01:24:02.521 --> 01:24:03.521
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not coming out this year.

01:24:03.541 --> 01:24:06.984
[SPEAKER_09]: They need to push it four more months.

01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:13.368
[SPEAKER_06]: EB Games Management, if you're listening, EB Games Management, update your damn systems.

01:24:13.388 --> 01:24:15.109
[SPEAKER_06]: That game will not be out this year, I guarantee it.

01:24:17.070 --> 01:24:20.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix and what was it?

01:24:20.372 --> 01:24:28.938
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix, DDR EX3, or EX3, EX2 will be out this year, and the Karaoke Party is going to be out before the year's out, right?

01:24:28.978 --> 01:24:30.079
[SPEAKER_06]: Karaoke Party got one week.

01:24:31.158 --> 01:24:31.738
[SPEAKER_06]: That's my big deal.

01:24:33.339 --> 01:24:34.920
[SPEAKER_06]: Karaoke Party will definitely be out this year.

01:24:35.020 --> 01:24:38.882
[SPEAKER_06]: Those will be Konami's big pushes for Christmas, and then next year they can start it on their own again.

01:24:38.902 --> 01:24:41.704
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, with your Extreme 2, you know, you get to play Karaoke Party, a demo.

01:24:42.919 --> 01:24:43.259
[SPEAKER_09]: That's true.

01:24:43.339 --> 01:24:44.100
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, really?

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:46.220
[SPEAKER_09]: No one told me this.

01:24:46.261 --> 01:24:46.521
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:24:46.721 --> 01:24:46.961
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.

01:24:47.181 --> 01:24:49.502
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's, yeah, that's pretty much about it.

01:24:50.002 --> 01:24:53.764
[SPEAKER_09]: Digital Life Expo next month, October 14th through 16th.

01:24:53.944 --> 01:24:55.484
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't remind me because I can't go.

01:24:56.005 --> 01:24:56.685
[SPEAKER_09]: I can't go.

01:24:57.125 --> 01:25:10.631
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that, but I'm just plugging the damn thing because, you know, there's people on the East Coast that would want to go, so I might as well plug it and just, you know, tell them the date.

01:25:11.138 --> 01:25:11.738
[SPEAKER_09]: They don't forget it.

01:25:12.079 --> 01:25:16.182
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't notice that because, you know, as I said, I'm like 30 miles away in college.

01:25:16.202 --> 01:25:17.723
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 30 miles from the city.

01:25:17.783 --> 01:25:20.605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 30 miles north of the city.

01:25:20.625 --> 01:25:22.046
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing a train won't get you to.

01:25:37.072 --> 01:25:40.715
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, because, you know, I'm still waiting for that first paycheck for my new job.

01:25:40.895 --> 01:25:41.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright.

01:25:42.416 --> 01:25:43.317
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's it.

01:25:43.777 --> 01:25:44.617
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe he'll be back.

01:25:45.918 --> 01:25:46.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright.

01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:48.440
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Zaku.

01:25:49.021 --> 01:25:50.322
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm letting you go so we can take other calls.

01:25:51.242 --> 01:25:51.602
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, man.

01:25:51.642 --> 01:25:52.143
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a good one.

01:25:52.663 --> 01:25:52.963
[SPEAKER_06]: Peace.

01:25:53.063 --> 01:25:53.424
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

01:25:54.885 --> 01:25:55.205
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:25:57.261 --> 01:25:58.261
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to another call.

01:25:58.361 --> 01:26:09.966
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize to those of you guys that are also trying to get in, but I definitely, definitely want to get Siggy in here because he was kind enough to get us some previews of a brand new Konami artist-related album that was out this week.

01:26:10.006 --> 01:26:11.987
[SPEAKER_06]: So I want to make sure he can get in here.

01:26:14.188 --> 01:26:15.549
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just going to wait for him to call.

01:26:16.589 --> 01:26:18.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we'll get to some more calls on the Skype line.

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:24.132
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, if you want to call us on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com and click on Interact With Us.

01:26:24.232 --> 01:26:25.053
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's try this again.

01:26:25.113 --> 01:26:25.693
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, you there?

01:26:26.738 --> 01:26:27.639
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I'm here, Sky.

01:26:27.739 --> 01:26:28.319
[SPEAKER_06]: Much better.

01:26:28.379 --> 01:26:29.140
[SPEAKER_06]: How you doing, my friend?

01:26:29.901 --> 01:26:30.661
[SPEAKER_21]: I'm doing fine.

01:26:31.002 --> 01:26:32.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we hear him in studio okay?

01:26:32.703 --> 01:26:32.863
[SPEAKER_06]: Good?

01:26:33.123 --> 01:26:33.324
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:26:33.424 --> 01:26:33.764
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, good.

01:26:34.685 --> 01:26:38.448
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy, now, I've been kind of keeping it a secret, because I know you wanted to talk about it.

01:26:38.568 --> 01:26:39.509
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we going to hear?

01:26:39.529 --> 01:26:41.270
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to let our listeners hear tonight?

01:26:42.131 --> 01:26:49.077
[SPEAKER_21]: As of September 16, 2005, Guitar Freak's drum mania artist, Asaki, released his debut album, Shinkoku.

01:26:49.978 --> 01:26:50.358
[SPEAKER_21]: Cool.

01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.400
[SPEAKER_21]: So, uh...

01:26:53.252 --> 01:27:02.417
[SPEAKER_21]: There are actually four new original tracks by ASAKI, and the six of them are from Bimondi games like Guitar Fixed Drift Mania and Pop It Music.

01:27:03.057 --> 01:27:09.540
[SPEAKER_21]: So we're going to play track number two, which is the first original song by ASAKI.

01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:14.963
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a mid-tempo song with very heavy guitar riffs and such.

01:27:15.763 --> 01:27:17.744
[SPEAKER_21]: So here's Firefly Hotaru.

01:27:18.516 --> 01:27:20.017
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just going to be playing clips of these songs, too.

01:27:20.037 --> 01:27:20.838
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to play the whole thing.

01:27:20.858 --> 01:27:21.598
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there like six minute long songs?

01:27:21.618 --> 01:27:22.559
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a minute long clips, yeah.

01:27:22.579 --> 01:27:23.119
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.

01:27:23.179 --> 01:27:25.761
[SPEAKER_06]: This is track two, one of the brand new Asaki songs.

01:27:26.801 --> 01:27:29.203
[SPEAKER_15]: Asaki songs

01:27:53.668 --> 01:27:54.908
[SPEAKER_06]: Now see, I dug that one.

01:27:54.948 --> 01:27:56.629
[SPEAKER_06]: That should have been on the Ultramix 3 VRare.

01:27:57.329 --> 01:27:59.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't that be cool to have a song like that on Ultramix 3?

01:27:59.950 --> 01:28:00.430
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

01:28:00.550 --> 01:28:00.910
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:28:01.670 --> 01:28:03.731
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright, what else are we going to hear?

01:28:03.771 --> 01:28:05.091
[SPEAKER_21]: Even though I don't play Xbox, yeah.

01:28:06.052 --> 01:28:06.392
[SPEAKER_21]: I think so.

01:28:06.412 --> 01:28:07.292
[SPEAKER_06]: Still, it would be a good thing.

01:28:07.312 --> 01:28:07.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, then fine.

01:28:07.832 --> 01:28:08.612
[SPEAKER_06]: EX2, whatever.

01:28:09.553 --> 01:28:09.853
[SPEAKER_21]: Alright.

01:28:11.312 --> 01:28:17.453
[SPEAKER_21]: The second track, which is another track in the Asagi original, is a very soft piano ballad.

01:28:18.574 --> 01:28:21.954
[SPEAKER_21]: It's a very... How should I say it?

01:28:23.695 --> 01:28:24.855
[SPEAKER_21]: Very slow, very soft.

01:28:24.935 --> 01:28:27.936
[SPEAKER_21]: So here's the sound it conveys in Yogo no Oto.

01:28:29.516 --> 01:28:30.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here's... Track 5.

01:28:30.816 --> 01:28:31.696
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, that's track 5.

01:28:31.736 --> 01:28:33.137
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for it.

01:28:33.177 --> 01:28:33.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

01:28:33.937 --> 01:28:34.557
[SPEAKER_06]: Piano ballad.

01:28:36.277 --> 01:28:37.558
Piano ballad.

01:28:43.872 --> 01:28:48.914
[SPEAKER_15]: Now that would not be a good song for DDR.

01:29:11.803 --> 01:29:12.684
[SPEAKER_21]: Definitely not.

01:29:12.904 --> 01:29:13.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:29:13.704 --> 01:29:16.746
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Keyboard Mania, like a one-face song on Keyboard Mania.

01:29:16.806 --> 01:29:18.126
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, what else are we going to hear?

01:29:18.467 --> 01:29:18.767
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah.

01:29:18.887 --> 01:29:26.631
[SPEAKER_21]: The third track is Track 9, a third new Asahi original, which is kind of like taking a page out of Tsuminagara Toka no Juwaifu.

01:29:27.071 --> 01:29:34.915
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is The Divine Comedy, which is a popular poem written by Dante Algieri, a.k.a.

01:29:34.955 --> 01:29:35.795
[SPEAKER_21]: Dante's Inferno.

01:29:35.855 --> 01:29:36.616
[SPEAKER_21]: So here it is.

01:29:36.636 --> 01:29:38.977
[SPEAKER_21]: And this is where the album gets its name.

01:29:39.097 --> 01:29:39.857
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the title track.

01:29:39.877 --> 01:29:39.957
[SPEAKER_21]: Yep.

01:29:40.178 --> 01:29:40.398
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:29:40.658 --> 01:29:40.798
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

01:29:45.612 --> 01:29:46.573
Thank you for watching!

01:30:29.451 --> 01:30:30.152
[SPEAKER_06]: That's pretty cool.

01:30:30.312 --> 01:30:30.772
[SPEAKER_06]: I like that.

01:30:30.832 --> 01:30:31.913
[SPEAKER_06]: Very diverse.

01:30:31.933 --> 01:30:36.777
[SPEAKER_06]: This seems like it would be a good just kind of chill out music playing in the background while you're trying to study or something.

01:30:36.797 --> 01:30:37.237
[SPEAKER_06]: This is good.

01:30:37.277 --> 01:30:37.658
[SPEAKER_06]: I like this.

01:30:38.739 --> 01:30:43.863
[SPEAKER_10]: That last one makes me think sort of post-Gogged Malasmizer.

01:30:44.303 --> 01:30:44.704
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

01:30:44.724 --> 01:30:45.164
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.

01:30:45.604 --> 01:30:50.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, if you're just joining us, we're listening to tracks from the brand new Masaki album, which was just released this week.

01:30:51.389 --> 01:30:52.030
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy's with us.

01:30:52.310 --> 01:30:53.711
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else are we going to hear tonight, Siggy?

01:30:54.477 --> 01:30:59.740
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I just forgot to mention that track 9 was the longest Asahi song, which is about 9 minutes long.

01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:01.621
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a behemoth of a song, yes it was.

01:31:01.902 --> 01:31:06.504
[SPEAKER_06]: But I would expect any song that's going to have Dante's Inferno is going to be kind of long.

01:31:07.365 --> 01:31:09.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, what else are we going to hear?

01:31:09.226 --> 01:31:16.170
[SPEAKER_21]: And this one's the last track, the last Asahi original, which is the most ordinary Asahi song that I've ever heard.

01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:19.872
[SPEAKER_21]: It's With Bubble in the Clear Sky, Sorasumi no Hiyodorito.

01:31:20.393 --> 01:31:20.733
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.

01:32:14.009 --> 01:32:15.531
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, very cool, very cool.

01:32:15.571 --> 01:32:23.057
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's hear, you know, for those folks that may not recognize Sasaki too much, what's one of these songs that was actually in a previous Pomani game?

01:32:24.717 --> 01:32:35.781
[SPEAKER_21]: The very first Asahi song that he ever, that the Bimani series he got released was Tanagi from Guitar Fixed Romania 7th mix, 6th mix.

01:32:36.041 --> 01:32:43.044
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, and yes, this one's in rotation on our station as well, so you've probably heard this song before, but it's a long mix, so here's a little clip of this one.

01:32:43.624 --> 01:32:44.144
[SPEAKER_15]: Here we go.

01:33:10.297 --> 01:33:13.740
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, those are tracks from the brand new album by Asaki.

01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.141
[SPEAKER_06]: Shinkioku?

01:33:15.401 --> 01:33:15.961
[SPEAKER_06]: Did I say that right?

01:33:16.221 --> 01:33:16.442
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:33:16.642 --> 01:33:16.942
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

01:33:16.962 --> 01:33:17.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Shinkioku.

01:33:17.622 --> 01:33:18.183
[SPEAKER_06]: Shinkioku.

01:33:18.323 --> 01:33:19.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, I'm learning.

01:33:19.384 --> 01:33:23.567
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, so now if folks want to order this album, how can they pick it up, Siggy?

01:33:24.968 --> 01:33:33.334
[SPEAKER_21]: I haven't checked out some online retailers, but I think PlayAshow should be starting their orders.

01:33:34.314 --> 01:33:35.375
[SPEAKER_10]: CD Japan too, right?

01:33:37.547 --> 01:33:40.868
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett actually ordered this CD because he was kind of... He may have.

01:33:41.288 --> 01:33:44.089
[SPEAKER_06]: He was actually happy to hear these preview tracks because he hasn't gotten this CD yet.

01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:45.389
[SPEAKER_06]: So where did you pick this up from?

01:33:47.450 --> 01:33:51.171
[SPEAKER_07]: I ordered mine from PlayAsia, but I thought Gali's... I don't know.

01:33:51.191 --> 01:33:53.332
[SPEAKER_07]: Did they change the release date on Gali's art book?

01:33:53.352 --> 01:33:59.494
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I thought it was supposed to come out on the same day, but it obviously changed, so I'm not getting it until October when Gali's book comes out.

01:34:00.014 --> 01:34:00.654
[SPEAKER_07]: So, oh well.

01:34:01.114 --> 01:34:01.894
[SPEAKER_07]: I get to listen to it now.

01:34:02.275 --> 01:34:03.915
[SPEAKER_21]: Uh-huh.

01:34:04.975 --> 01:34:05.596
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I knew that they...

01:34:07.510 --> 01:34:08.731
[SPEAKER_06]: Siggy has a question for you, Garrett.

01:34:09.291 --> 01:34:09.591
[SPEAKER_21]: What's that?

01:34:09.691 --> 01:34:18.336
[SPEAKER_21]: No, I'm just gonna tell Garrett that the file that I sent to Sky, it has the pictures of the cover, the CD, the lyrics to it.

01:34:19.296 --> 01:34:20.077
[SPEAKER_21]: Yeah, I saw those.

01:34:22.338 --> 01:34:22.758
[SPEAKER_21]: Ah, okay.

01:34:23.174 --> 01:34:23.575
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't blame you.

01:34:39.034 --> 01:34:39.575
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't blame you.

01:34:39.795 --> 01:34:40.336
[SPEAKER_06]: I appreciate it.

01:34:40.356 --> 01:34:41.237
[SPEAKER_06]: There's just too much.

01:34:41.277 --> 01:34:42.118
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets overwhelming sometimes.

01:34:42.339 --> 01:34:49.308
[SPEAKER_06]: And Garrett really helps fill me in on a lot of that stuff because he can understand a lot of Japanese and Jamie does too.

01:34:49.368 --> 01:34:52.351
[SPEAKER_06]: And between the two of them I get filled in on what's going on.

01:34:52.432 --> 01:34:54.995
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, otherwise I'm lost.

01:34:55.315 --> 01:34:57.318
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just a dumb whitey.

01:34:58.810 --> 01:35:01.493
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, I don't blame your... Just don't blame your color.

01:35:02.154 --> 01:35:02.734
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

01:35:02.774 --> 01:35:04.056
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a joke, kids.

01:35:04.256 --> 01:35:04.716
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good guys.

01:35:04.777 --> 01:35:05.998
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know it's a joke.

01:35:06.458 --> 01:35:07.179
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good guys, Jim.

01:35:08.260 --> 01:35:10.522
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm just... I'm just... I don't know.

01:35:11.844 --> 01:35:12.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:35:12.144 --> 01:35:13.025
[SPEAKER_21]: Hey, uh... Oh.

01:35:13.766 --> 01:35:14.366
[SPEAKER_21]: One more thing.

01:35:14.386 --> 01:35:14.587
[SPEAKER_21]: Sure.

01:35:15.808 --> 01:35:15.848
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

01:35:19.819 --> 01:35:21.000
[SPEAKER_21]: 2DX Bastard here.

01:35:21.040 --> 01:35:21.840
[SPEAKER_21]: Nice to meet you.

01:35:22.080 --> 01:35:22.360
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, no.

01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.641
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a 2DX Bastard, too.

01:35:23.801 --> 01:35:25.262
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a 2DX and Poppenese Bastard.

01:35:25.282 --> 01:35:30.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Siggy insists that he is the 2DX Bastard, so you're going to have to be like the 2DX wench.

01:35:30.844 --> 01:35:32.325
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, I love Keyboard Mania.

01:35:32.986 --> 01:35:33.186
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

01:35:33.206 --> 01:35:34.286
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be a... Screw y'all.

01:35:34.326 --> 01:35:35.747
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a Keyboard Mania hussy.

01:35:37.168 --> 01:35:37.448
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:35:37.508 --> 01:35:38.208
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, no.

01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.909
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Siggy.

01:35:39.929 --> 01:35:40.649
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling in.

01:35:40.669 --> 01:35:42.730
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to try and get to one more call, so I've got to let you go, okay?

01:35:42.750 --> 01:35:44.431
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about dance, dance, dance.

01:35:44.451 --> 01:35:44.951
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

01:35:46.052 --> 01:35:46.372
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:35:46.472 --> 01:35:47.072
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Siggy.

01:35:47.132 --> 01:35:48.253
[SPEAKER_06]: We enjoy having him on the program.

01:35:49.747 --> 01:35:51.728
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to one more call here tonight.

01:35:51.788 --> 01:35:55.709
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, you're on Orange Sound Radio.

01:35:55.949 --> 01:35:57.049
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Ranchan.

[SPEAKER_06]: What is on your mind?

01:35:58.410 --> 01:36:01.451
[SPEAKER_06]: You were the first to get the boot from DarkSakura tonight for the K-Word, weren't you?

01:36:03.071 --> 01:36:03.571
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

01:36:04.792 --> 01:36:07.332
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, Ranchan, your connection is really, really bad right now.

01:36:07.372 --> 01:36:11.374
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've got anything you can turn off there in the background, please do so.

01:36:11.754 --> 01:36:13.574
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no porn torrents, my friend.

01:36:14.034 --> 01:36:14.855
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I'm kidding, I know.

01:36:15.015 --> 01:36:16.255
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you wouldn't do that during the show.

01:36:16.375 --> 01:36:17.556
[SPEAKER_02]: I just killed it.

01:36:17.836 --> 01:36:18.836
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so what's on your mind?

01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:27.046
[SPEAKER_02]: I was there at Nintendo World this morning You got to see Miyamoto today Hell no No?

01:36:27.126 --> 01:36:27.846
[SPEAKER_02]: What happened?

01:36:28.907 --> 01:36:49.584
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this was the plan Me and my crew was going to go down there at 7am and relax and get on the line One of my friends said go down there 10 o'clock Saturday night and check it out I said I'll go down at 10 If I see a line I'm grabbing my bags and I'm going I never left I did not think it was going to be that packed Wow It was crazy

01:36:50.339 --> 01:36:54.984
[SPEAKER_06]: Only on NintendoWorld.com and if you're on the Nintendo mailing list.

01:36:56.146 --> 01:36:57.247
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was like 12 people?

01:36:57.267 --> 01:36:58.108
[SPEAKER_02]: No, like 12 million.

01:37:11.002 --> 01:37:11.843
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

01:37:12.364 --> 01:37:13.004
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think so.

01:37:13.104 --> 01:37:14.465
[SPEAKER_06]: It was about 800 people there.

01:37:14.486 --> 01:37:14.566
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

01:37:33.616 --> 01:37:34.657
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sweet.

01:37:34.997 --> 01:37:35.617
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty sweet.

01:37:35.657 --> 01:37:38.399
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really nice because it looks so modern, you know?

01:37:38.659 --> 01:37:44.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Before, when it was the Pokemon, it looked all kiddy, but it looks really modern, like so 90s chic, you know?

01:37:44.563 --> 01:37:45.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

01:37:45.143 --> 01:37:45.543
[SPEAKER_06]: Very cool.

01:37:46.244 --> 01:37:46.544
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

01:37:46.644 --> 01:37:48.805
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also... A few more things and then I'll go.

01:37:48.825 --> 01:37:48.965
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.

01:37:48.985 --> 01:37:53.668
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm seeing a link to the chat of a bunch of us hanging out today, trying to get inside.

01:37:54.033 --> 01:37:55.014
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so check that out.

01:37:55.074 --> 01:37:56.794
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron Chan just posted that in our chat room there.

01:37:56.834 --> 01:37:59.196
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a photobucket link of pictures from today.

01:38:00.136 --> 01:38:04.298
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe if you look very carefully, you might see one little pixel that happens to be Miyamoto.

01:38:04.919 --> 01:38:06.419
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three pictures of Miyamoto up there.

01:38:06.699 --> 01:38:07.180
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay, cool.

01:38:07.760 --> 01:38:10.661
[SPEAKER_02]: We got them from the window, and the first guy was on the line.

01:38:10.902 --> 01:38:14.904
[SPEAKER_02]: He flew in from Detroit, and he was there since 12 noon Saturday.

01:38:16.244 --> 01:38:16.665
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

01:38:17.405 --> 01:38:18.105
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I mean?

01:38:18.385 --> 01:38:19.906
[SPEAKER_06]: See what I mean about some crazy guys?

01:38:20.106 --> 01:38:21.347
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you looking at that link right now, Loki?

01:38:23.156 --> 01:38:24.557
[SPEAKER_06]: I see Ronchan, that must be the link.

01:38:25.298 --> 01:38:28.520
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's me as Link, yeah, that's my friend.

01:38:28.980 --> 01:38:30.701
[SPEAKER_06]: You dressed up in a Minish cap there.

01:38:32.362 --> 01:38:34.163
[SPEAKER_02]: No, somebody actually came with a Minish cap.

01:38:34.323 --> 01:38:36.324
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my classic Link hat that was made for me.

01:38:36.585 --> 01:38:38.226
[SPEAKER_22]: You bought a Minish cap and it came with a person?

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:40.167
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I wish.

01:38:41.055 --> 01:38:42.056
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:39:08.860 --> 01:39:11.282
[SPEAKER_02]: We were chanting Mario just like that.

01:39:12.203 --> 01:39:15.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Second time we came to the window, we were shouting, Nintendo!

01:39:15.526 --> 01:39:16.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Nintendo!

01:39:16.067 --> 01:39:25.155
[SPEAKER_02]: There were people throwing up, holding up their Nintendo controllers, pads, consoles, Powerpads, Power Gloves, U-Forces.

01:39:26.336 --> 01:39:28.798
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody walked down the street with an autographed Power Glove.

01:39:29.339 --> 01:39:31.421
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm telling you.

01:39:31.441 --> 01:39:32.462
[SPEAKER_22]: That is so bad.

01:39:33.570 --> 01:39:39.313
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, MTV was there and they're going to put a bunch of us on the whole Xbox video game special next month.

01:39:39.633 --> 01:39:42.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, you're going to be on the Xbox video game special?

01:39:43.235 --> 01:39:49.678
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're doing like a video game special the week that Xbox comes out and they did a complete cover of Miyamoto being in town.

01:39:49.758 --> 01:39:54.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, but do you see the problem with this?

01:39:54.981 --> 01:39:55.581
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it just me?

01:39:56.422 --> 01:39:59.043
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Miyamoto, last I checked, works for Nintendo.

01:40:00.279 --> 01:40:03.361
[SPEAKER_06]: Nintendo, MTV, Nintendo, Xbox, not Nintendo.

01:40:03.662 --> 01:40:05.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, I thought Nintendo made the Xbox.

01:40:06.023 --> 01:40:07.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm completely wrong.

01:40:10.307 --> 01:40:11.087
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

01:40:11.428 --> 01:40:20.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would have loved to see the MTV crew going up going, Hey, so can we be first in line to order our Xbox 360 here?

01:40:21.475 --> 01:40:21.715
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

01:40:21.936 --> 01:40:23.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I could see them interviewing Miyamoto.

01:40:24.337 --> 01:40:25.959
[SPEAKER_06]: So what do we have to look forward to in Halo 3?

01:40:27.904 --> 01:40:30.325
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually joke about that online, okay?

01:40:30.745 --> 01:40:41.487
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, at the end of... If you don't beat Halo 3 in a certain amount of time, then the moon is going to crash into the world and... We're sorry, Master Chief, but our princess is in another castle.

01:40:41.807 --> 01:40:42.747
[SPEAKER_22]: No, it's on another Halo.

01:40:44.347 --> 01:40:45.228
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Ranma.

01:40:45.908 --> 01:40:46.688
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm booting you now.

01:40:46.828 --> 01:40:47.448
[SPEAKER_06]: But have a good one.

01:40:47.468 --> 01:40:48.168
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

01:40:48.928 --> 01:40:49.208
[SPEAKER_22]: You too.

01:40:49.228 --> 01:40:49.388
[SPEAKER_22]: Thanks.

01:40:49.408 --> 01:40:50.469
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad to hear you had fun today.

01:40:50.549 --> 01:40:51.009
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

01:40:51.729 --> 01:40:52.109
[SPEAKER_03]: Bye.

01:40:53.612 --> 01:40:54.032
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell?

01:40:54.092 --> 01:40:57.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Why would MTV show a Miyamoto interview during an Xbox special?

01:40:59.093 --> 01:40:59.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Idiots!

01:41:01.474 --> 01:41:02.934
[SPEAKER_22]: That's the talented MTV.

01:41:05.514 --> 01:41:06.615
[SPEAKER_22]: MTV stands for what again?

01:41:08.135 --> 01:41:11.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, mushy, trashy videos?

01:41:11.356 --> 01:41:11.696
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:41:13.156 --> 01:41:15.337
[SPEAKER_22]: You only see videos between like 2 and 4 a.m.

01:41:15.957 --> 01:41:17.397
[SPEAKER_22]: It's like the only time you can't buy booze.

01:41:17.417 --> 01:41:18.697
[SPEAKER_22]: You can see music videos, though.

01:41:19.197 --> 01:41:19.437
[SPEAKER_06]: Hmm.

01:41:20.078 --> 01:41:21.118
[SPEAKER_22]: Are they trying to tell us something?

01:41:21.478 --> 01:41:21.778
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:41:22.098 --> 01:41:22.358
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

01:41:23.502 --> 01:41:25.745
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to go to a break because we need a break.

01:41:25.765 --> 01:41:28.649
[SPEAKER_06]: When we come back from this break, we are going to get to the cage match.

01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:30.411
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get to the sim update of the week.

01:41:30.812 --> 01:41:32.694
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get to the FUs and a whole lot more.

01:41:32.774 --> 01:41:34.697
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to get to the winner of the contest.

01:41:34.717 --> 01:41:36.259
[SPEAKER_06]: This is your last chance to get in.

01:41:36.299 --> 01:41:37.941
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the last time I'm giving out this email.

01:41:38.462 --> 01:41:40.365
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to give away momentarily.

01:41:40.985 --> 01:41:44.308
[SPEAKER_06]: of V-Rare for Max 2 and EX2.

01:41:44.668 --> 01:41:54.737
[SPEAKER_06]: And by entering tonight, you're not only going to be eligible for tonight's drawing, but you will already be eligible for this week's drawing, which we're going to turn loose to the thousands of people that listen to us on the podcast.

01:41:55.158 --> 01:41:56.879
[SPEAKER_06]: So your chances are much better tonight.

[SPEAKER_06]: So get in now, send an email, freestuff at orangelaunchradio.com.

01:42:01.123 --> 01:42:03.745
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're the winner, you better answer my reply or you don't get shit.

01:42:04.526 --> 01:42:04.826
[SPEAKER_06]: All right?

01:42:05.407 --> 01:42:06.268
[SPEAKER_06]: Woohoo, shit!

01:42:06.308 --> 01:42:08.169
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought shit was the other thing.

01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:10.171
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's the thing we're going to give away.

01:42:10.211 --> 01:42:12.853
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to talk about this during the break, how we're going to give this away, so we'll see.

01:42:13.834 --> 01:42:14.434
[SPEAKER_06]: In pieces.

01:42:14.594 --> 01:42:17.076
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:42:17.116 --> 01:42:22.580
[SPEAKER_06]: In this break, we're going to do one of my favorite songs from the Ultramix 3 VRare, because it sounds like synth pop.

01:42:22.921 --> 01:42:24.382
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Rain Dancer with Come With Me.

01:42:24.862 --> 01:42:29.506
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we're going to get to another song, which I don't have labeled, because I'm a dumbass.

01:42:29.686 --> 01:42:32.228
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, um... Track 10.

01:42:32.548 --> 01:42:33.329
[SPEAKER_06]: What was track 10?

01:42:33.369 --> 01:42:34.630
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's another, um...

01:42:35.506 --> 01:42:36.927
[SPEAKER_06]: I couldn't hear you.

01:42:36.947 --> 01:42:39.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Rainbow Flyer is going to be the other song we hear in this break.

01:42:39.909 --> 01:42:42.311
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:44:43.941 --> 01:44:44.854
Thanks for watching!

01:45:16.773 --> 01:45:17.754
Thanks for watching!

01:45:44.734 --> 01:45:45.475
Thanks for watching!

01:46:16.338 --> 01:46:17.340
Thanks for watching!

01:47:20.201 --> 01:47:22.251
I am the only God in the universe.

01:48:19.582 --> 01:48:20.663
Thanks for watching!

01:48:47.788 --> 01:48:48.930
Thank you for watching!

01:49:36.933 --> 01:49:37.583
Thanks for watching!

01:50:16.586 --> 01:50:21.108
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, Ash!

01:50:21.649 --> 01:50:24.270
[SPEAKER_05]: This randomness could only be brought to you by Orange Lounge.

01:50:27.168 --> 01:50:28.248
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura or Loki as well.

01:50:52.884 --> 01:50:53.785
[SPEAKER_06]: So give that a try.

01:50:54.045 --> 01:50:58.888
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to give away those CDs any minute now, so free stuff at orangelaundry.com.

01:50:58.908 --> 01:51:01.569
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not in there yet, you might just be SOL.

01:51:02.530 --> 01:51:05.772
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I do want to point out is something actually, Sakurina brought this to my attention.

01:51:05.792 --> 01:51:14.016
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a brand new page posted over at Konami Style that actually has some more information about Guitar Freaks V, the home release.

01:51:14.056 --> 01:51:16.038
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, that being a big surprise at...

01:51:17.503 --> 01:51:23.605
[SPEAKER_06]: The Tokyo Game Show this year is that they are going to revive the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania series with V. And look at this.

01:51:23.805 --> 01:51:24.165
[SPEAKER_06]: Look at that.

01:51:24.505 --> 01:51:26.486
[SPEAKER_06]: That is an ASC, ladies and gentlemen.

01:51:26.526 --> 01:51:28.426
[SPEAKER_06]: That is the arcade-style controller.

01:51:29.367 --> 01:51:29.727
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.

01:51:29.767 --> 01:51:32.408
[SPEAKER_06]: They have the little metal cord and everything.

01:51:32.428 --> 01:51:33.388
[SPEAKER_06]: And the little strap.

01:51:33.828 --> 01:51:34.948
[SPEAKER_06]: That is going to be badass.

01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.769
[SPEAKER_07]: I want one.

01:51:36.009 --> 01:51:36.989
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out.

01:51:37.549 --> 01:51:39.230
[SPEAKER_06]: And the link, again, is posted in the chat room.

01:51:39.270 --> 01:51:41.190
[SPEAKER_06]: It's over at KonamiStyle.jp.

01:51:41.751 --> 01:51:42.491
[SPEAKER_06]: Yep, I'm getting one.

01:51:42.511 --> 01:51:43.371
[SPEAKER_06]: In their custom factory.

01:51:44.111 --> 01:51:45.972
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't those things going to be expensive, though?

01:51:47.012 --> 01:51:47.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

01:51:48.392 --> 01:51:51.113
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not a big enough fan of Guitar Freaks.

01:51:51.133 --> 01:51:53.434
[SPEAKER_22]: Do they have an extra hole so you can use it for other things?

01:51:55.234 --> 01:52:01.256
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you know I'm going to have one at my house because my husband is the world's biggest Guitar Freaks fan.

01:52:01.776 --> 01:52:05.977
[SPEAKER_07]: They advertise the game as Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania is being released.

01:52:06.077 --> 01:52:14.260
[SPEAKER_07]: So right now with the arcade style controller for Guitar Freaks, I believe Konami Style is doing the petition thing to get their polls and see like, okay, how much do you want to spend?

01:52:14.280 --> 01:52:15.100
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you really want it?

01:52:15.180 --> 01:52:15.460
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

01:52:15.984 --> 01:52:19.086
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm so excited that they're bringing Guitar Freaks back, though.

01:52:19.106 --> 01:52:21.107
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm really excited and I hope they do is that they really...

01:52:38.658 --> 01:52:40.339
[SPEAKER_06]: Check that out on KonamiStyle.

01:53:06.241 --> 01:53:10.104
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what we're going to do now, we're going to place a very special phone call.

01:53:10.225 --> 01:53:14.268
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got a phone call that we need to make, and we're going to place that right now.

01:53:14.348 --> 01:53:17.571
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're going to do is we're going to call somebody who's actually in the hospital.

01:53:18.011 --> 01:53:22.675
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's somebody who's been on the show previously, but it's not a bad reason why she's in the hospital.

01:53:22.715 --> 01:53:24.397
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll see why momentarily.

01:53:26.759 --> 01:53:28.720
[SPEAKER_06]: First I've got to make sure I'm putting in the number correctly here.

01:53:28.841 --> 01:53:31.623
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll call this number here.

01:53:32.924 --> 01:53:33.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully this connects.

01:53:37.062 --> 01:53:39.323
[SPEAKER_06]: This would be quite embarrassing if this whole damn thing didn't work.

01:53:41.363 --> 01:53:43.504
[SPEAKER_06]: Those of you guys there in the chatroom probably know what this is about.

01:53:43.604 --> 01:53:44.304
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, there we go, finally.

01:53:44.524 --> 01:53:45.065
[SPEAKER_06]: One ringy dingy.

01:53:53.667 --> 01:53:54.348
Two ringy dingys.

01:53:56.308 --> 01:53:57.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Three ringy dingys.

01:54:00.009 --> 01:54:00.430
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello?

01:54:01.070 --> 01:54:02.870
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, is this DD Archaholic?

01:54:04.551 --> 01:54:04.891
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

01:54:05.783 --> 01:54:08.685
[SPEAKER_06]: Anita, this is Rob on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:54:08.725 --> 01:54:09.245
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

01:54:11.687 --> 01:54:12.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Rob.

01:54:12.388 --> 01:54:12.568
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

01:54:13.368 --> 01:54:15.109
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't mind that I'm putting you on air right now, do you?

01:54:16.731 --> 01:54:17.251
[SPEAKER_11]: What's that?

01:54:17.351 --> 01:54:19.232
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't mind that I'm putting you on air right now, do you?

01:54:21.794 --> 01:54:22.174
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, no.

01:54:22.234 --> 01:54:23.195
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't mind being on air.

01:54:23.995 --> 01:54:27.218
[SPEAKER_06]: We called to say congratulations.

01:54:27.418 --> 01:54:28.439
[SPEAKER_11]: Congratulations.

01:54:28.599 --> 01:54:29.039
Thank you.

01:54:29.679 --> 01:54:30.060
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us.

01:54:30.120 --> 01:54:30.960
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us the details.

01:54:31.020 --> 01:54:31.701
[SPEAKER_06]: How did it go?

01:54:31.801 --> 01:54:32.461
[SPEAKER_06]: Boy or girl?

01:54:32.521 --> 01:54:33.082
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the name?

01:54:33.102 --> 01:54:33.642
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to know.

01:54:33.662 --> 01:54:34.883
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:54:36.175 --> 01:54:37.896
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a beautiful baby boy.

01:54:39.036 --> 01:54:41.377
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Donovan Kiyoshi.

01:54:41.397 --> 01:54:43.097
[SPEAKER_11]: I missed that.

01:54:43.157 --> 01:54:43.577
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time.

01:54:43.637 --> 01:54:44.017
[SPEAKER_06]: One more time.

01:54:44.057 --> 01:54:48.098
[SPEAKER_11]: His name is Donovan Kiyoshi.

01:54:48.298 --> 01:54:49.459
[SPEAKER_06]: Donovan Kiyoshi.

01:54:49.559 --> 01:54:50.199
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, cool.

01:54:50.419 --> 01:54:56.441
[SPEAKER_11]: And he was born Thursday at 1.30 in the afternoon.

01:54:58.521 --> 01:55:01.782
[SPEAKER_11]: And he weighed 6 pounds and 13 ounces.

01:55:01.922 --> 01:55:02.002
[SPEAKER_11]: Aww.

01:55:02.022 --> 01:55:04.163
[SPEAKER_11]: And he's tall.

01:55:17.611 --> 01:55:20.173
[SPEAKER_06]: We are so happy for you, Anita.

01:55:20.253 --> 01:55:21.534
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see pictures.

01:55:21.614 --> 01:55:22.454
[SPEAKER_06]: We want to see pictures.

01:55:22.514 --> 01:55:23.435
[SPEAKER_06]: When do we get to see pictures?

01:55:24.996 --> 01:55:26.257
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure, very soon.

01:55:26.297 --> 01:55:28.498
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be coming home from the hospital tomorrow.

01:55:30.760 --> 01:55:32.661
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll be able to post some pictures on the net.

01:55:33.061 --> 01:55:45.264
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, and if those of you guys are wondering why we have... I have a live journal, and I can go on Orange Lounge, I can figure out to do it maybe on Orange Lounge's website.

01:55:45.564 --> 01:55:49.586
[SPEAKER_11]: Absolutely, absolutely, you've got to post those... If you want to do something like that, I can send you pictures.

01:55:50.306 --> 01:55:57.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely, you've got to post that on the site for us, so... Can you hear him calling right now?

01:55:57.348 --> 01:55:57.588
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

01:55:57.608 --> 01:55:57.648
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh!

01:55:59.928 --> 01:56:01.989
[SPEAKER_11]: He's right next to me...

01:56:02.982 --> 01:56:04.864
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm ready to eat, actually.

01:56:04.884 --> 01:56:06.446
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you so much.

01:56:06.466 --> 01:56:07.267
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so happy and proud to...

01:56:20.455 --> 01:56:22.136
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm so glad I can share it with you guys.

01:56:22.456 --> 01:56:24.377
[SPEAKER_11]: No problem.

01:56:25.177 --> 01:56:25.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Get well soon.

01:56:26.578 --> 01:56:31.600
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm asking Daniel to send me the hospital information so I can hopefully visit soon, like this week sometime.

01:56:31.640 --> 01:56:33.040
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hopefully you won't be there much longer.

01:56:33.380 --> 01:56:35.121
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, she's out tomorrow?

01:56:35.581 --> 01:56:36.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I didn't know.

01:56:36.422 --> 01:56:37.362
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm out tomorrow.

01:56:37.482 --> 01:56:38.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, well, crap.

01:56:38.222 --> 01:56:40.243
[SPEAKER_06]: I still want to come see the baby, so I'll have to come to your house.

01:56:41.124 --> 01:56:44.905
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it's a long drive, but maybe I can do it in the next couple weeks or so.

01:56:45.165 --> 01:56:48.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:56:48.787 --> 01:56:49.727
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll contact you offline.

01:56:51.198 --> 01:56:51.638
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

01:56:51.778 --> 01:56:52.039
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:56:52.079 --> 01:56:55.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Anita, congratulations once again from all of us here at Orange Lounge Radio to you.

01:56:57.122 --> 01:56:58.783
[SPEAKER_06]: One of our regulars having a baby.

01:56:58.843 --> 01:56:59.543
[SPEAKER_06]: We're so excited.

01:56:59.603 --> 01:57:00.664
[SPEAKER_06]: So congratulations.

01:57:00.804 --> 01:57:01.924
[SPEAKER_06]: And tell Donovan we said hi.

01:57:04.146 --> 01:57:05.146
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, I will.

01:57:05.186 --> 01:57:06.867
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you guys very much, too.

01:57:07.107 --> 01:57:07.868
[SPEAKER_06]: No problem.

01:57:07.968 --> 01:57:08.328
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses.

01:57:08.408 --> 01:57:14.312
[SPEAKER_11]: Everybody, all my friends and all my Damani friends and all my Orange Lounge friends, hi, everybody.

01:57:14.792 --> 01:57:15.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Share those drugs.

01:57:16.093 --> 01:57:16.793
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses.

01:57:16.853 --> 01:57:17.454
[SPEAKER_06]: Kisses, honey.

01:57:17.534 --> 01:57:17.954
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care.

01:57:19.337 --> 01:57:19.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

01:57:19.902 --> 01:57:20.205
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:57:20.246 --> 01:57:20.711
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

01:57:21.014 --> 01:57:21.296
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye-bye.

01:57:22.626 --> 01:57:23.287
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's so sweet.

01:57:23.367 --> 01:57:26.689
[SPEAKER_06]: I apologize to our listeners that Skype is a little bit crappy.

01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:28.490
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't really know how else to phrase that.

01:57:28.530 --> 01:57:29.751
[SPEAKER_06]: Skype's running a little bit crappy.

01:57:30.111 --> 01:57:33.594
[SPEAKER_06]: But our chat room just full of congratulations there.

01:57:33.714 --> 01:57:35.395
[SPEAKER_06]: Daniel's actually in chat right now.

01:57:35.455 --> 01:57:39.158
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you want to give congratulations to Daddy, Daddy's in chat right now.

01:57:39.538 --> 01:57:40.779
[SPEAKER_06]: OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

01:57:41.239 --> 01:57:41.960
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on chat.

01:57:42.160 --> 01:57:49.145
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's there to take those good wishes back to Anita from those of you guys in chat since you weren't able to talk to her on Skype.

01:57:49.165 --> 01:57:49.245
Okay.

01:57:49.838 --> 01:57:54.862
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, I think it's time now for us to move into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:57:56.943 --> 01:58:15.036
[SPEAKER_06]: The way the cage match works is that we play three songs for you, back to back to back, and you guys vote for your favorites, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we're not here.

01:58:15.596 --> 01:58:16.717
[SPEAKER_06]: Yuzo Koshiro, Midnight Maximum Tune

01:58:32.173 --> 01:58:32.573
[SPEAKER_06]: Right on.

01:58:33.133 --> 01:58:37.375
[SPEAKER_06]: And the song is Destination Blackout, and it was Miss DarkSakura's pick from last week.

01:58:37.395 --> 01:58:40.456
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. DarkSakura's pick from last week.

01:58:41.136 --> 01:58:42.357
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't roll your eyes at me.

01:58:42.617 --> 01:58:43.477
[SPEAKER_06]: Marriage is bliss.

01:58:43.677 --> 01:58:44.577
[SPEAKER_06]: Blah, blah, blah.

01:58:44.677 --> 01:58:44.978
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

01:58:45.458 --> 01:58:45.858
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

01:58:46.398 --> 01:58:51.540
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, a clip of song number one, Destination Blackout, here on Orange Lounge, the Cage Match.

01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:24.681
I want to see it now.

01:59:24.701 --> 01:59:25.142
No gravity.

01:59:25.222 --> 01:59:25.322
One.

02:00:44.201 --> 02:00:48.905
[SPEAKER_06]: Alrighty, that was a clip of song number one, Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

02:00:48.945 --> 02:00:51.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Received some very good marks on last week's show.

02:00:51.607 --> 02:00:57.111
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see if it continues to win for a second week in a row, or if it falls prey to one of our challengers tonight.

02:00:57.171 --> 02:00:58.072
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, you're up first.

02:00:58.112 --> 02:00:59.793
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you pick for us tonight?

02:01:00.654 --> 02:01:07.899
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I got a copy of the Diverse 9 album, and this is one of the tracks, actually one of the last tracks.

02:01:07.959 --> 02:01:11.342
[SPEAKER_06]: And I remember listening to the demo of this back when I was looking at this.

02:01:12.146 --> 02:01:12.907
[SPEAKER_06]: The Black Mages Doresia

02:01:38.588 --> 02:01:40.250
Thanks for watching!

02:02:01.625 --> 02:02:03.227
Thanks for watching!

02:05:41.479 --> 02:05:43.802
[SPEAKER_06]: That one's coming to you courtesy of Diverse Systems.

02:05:43.862 --> 02:05:51.473
[SPEAKER_06]: That's Doresia with V. Let's go around and see if V gets an A or an F. DarkSakura.

02:05:51.854 --> 02:05:52.755
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't get into it.

02:05:53.657 --> 02:05:56.240
[SPEAKER_10]: It just was disjointed.

02:05:57.282 --> 02:05:58.083
[SPEAKER_09]: Disjointed, okay.

02:05:58.800 --> 02:06:04.302
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was above average, but definitely below the greatest thing I've ever heard.

02:06:04.362 --> 02:06:12.125
[SPEAKER_10]: Definitely better than just about everything I've heard off that V-Rare, so it gets a seven and a half.

02:06:12.265 --> 02:06:12.865
[SPEAKER_10]: Seven and a half.

02:06:13.525 --> 02:06:13.846
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki.

02:06:14.566 --> 02:06:15.106
[SPEAKER_06]: Gets a nine.

02:06:15.146 --> 02:06:16.707
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been blasting this into my car.

02:06:17.807 --> 02:06:18.107
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugged.

02:06:19.808 --> 02:06:20.148
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven.

02:06:21.468 --> 02:06:21.869
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett.

02:06:22.629 --> 02:06:22.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Seven.

02:06:24.313 --> 02:06:25.033
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to give it an 8.

02:06:25.553 --> 02:06:28.394
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it, but I don't know.

02:06:28.494 --> 02:06:34.695
[SPEAKER_06]: Something about Bomani songs in Cage Match is weird to me, but I still liked it, so I'm going to give it an 8.

02:06:35.375 --> 02:06:36.416
[SPEAKER_06]: So, it was cool.

02:06:37.116 --> 02:06:40.077
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, my song we're going to do tonight, song number 3.

02:06:40.137 --> 02:06:48.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, a lot of people have been ripping on Zonk over that remix, so I thought, okay, I'm going to give Zonk a chance with one of their original songs.

02:06:48.278 --> 02:06:51.259
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm going to put Zonk in tonight's Cage Match, because I really couldn't think of anything else.

02:06:54.066 --> 02:06:55.367
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a Bomani song.

02:06:55.427 --> 02:06:56.248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not a Bomani song.

02:06:56.268 --> 02:06:57.609
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an original Zonk song.

02:06:58.450 --> 02:06:58.990
[SPEAKER_06]: Kiss my butt.

02:06:59.391 --> 02:06:59.671
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:07:00.151 --> 02:07:04.595
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Zonk, song number three tonight with Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

02:07:04.915 --> 02:07:05.316
[SPEAKER_06]: Check this out.

02:07:05.336 --> 02:07:12.702
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of their original songs from their latest EP, which is called... Shit, I don't remember the name of this EP.

02:07:12.722 --> 02:07:15.164
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it's... I would order just on that name alone.

02:07:15.344 --> 02:07:16.325
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Half Human.

02:07:16.525 --> 02:07:16.825
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

02:07:16.905 --> 02:07:17.866
[SPEAKER_06]: Half Human is the name of it.

02:07:17.886 --> 02:07:18.106
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:07:18.126 --> 02:07:18.427
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

02:07:18.747 --> 02:07:20.188
[SPEAKER_06]: Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

02:07:20.488 --> 02:07:20.729
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

02:08:08.721 --> 02:08:09.321

Thanks for watching!

02:11:36.594 --> 02:11:37.635
Thank you for watching!

02:11:58.393 --> 02:12:02.535
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number three in tonight's cage match is Zonk, Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

02:12:02.595 --> 02:12:06.256
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see if that song delighted the folks here in the studio.

02:12:06.516 --> 02:12:08.837
[SPEAKER_06]: But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys in chat.

02:12:09.197 --> 02:12:09.498
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie.

02:12:10.378 --> 02:12:15.600
[SPEAKER_10]: My first impression of it was that I was liking it, I was getting into it, and then it started to repeat.

02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.482
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's sort of like, duh, duh, duh, repeat, repeat.

02:12:22.203 --> 02:12:22.743
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, it's over.

02:12:24.008 --> 02:12:35.995
[SPEAKER_10]: So, um, I like it better than Loki's pick, because it had a cool kind of groove to it, and wasn't all disjointed, but it did sort of... Are you saying, it had a good beat, and it was easy to dance to?

02:12:36.315 --> 02:12:43.259
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it had a good deep beat, but I would probably fall asleep dancing to it, so... Um, it gets an 8.5.

02:12:43.559 --> 02:12:44.180
[SPEAKER_06]: 8.5 from DarkSakura.

02:12:44.200 --> 02:12:44.500
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki!

02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:51.404
[SPEAKER_06]: It gets, like, a 7.5, because it was better than the remix that was on the Ultramix 3 soundtrack, but, uh...

02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:53.851
[SPEAKER_06]: They do some weird stuff.

02:12:54.351 --> 02:12:54.891
[SPEAKER_06]: It was okay, though.

02:12:54.911 --> 02:12:56.432
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't find it repetitive or anything like that.

02:12:56.752 --> 02:12:57.172
[SPEAKER_06]: It was good.

02:12:57.353 --> 02:12:57.633
[SPEAKER_05]: Bud!

02:12:59.454 --> 02:13:00.714
[SPEAKER_22]: I didn't want it, nor did I need it.

02:13:00.754 --> 02:13:01.114
[SPEAKER_22]: Five.

02:13:01.835 --> 02:13:02.195
[SPEAKER_05]: Good.

02:13:03.336 --> 02:13:04.236
[SPEAKER_05]: I zonked out.

02:13:04.396 --> 02:13:06.637
[SPEAKER_06]: Six.

02:13:07.077 --> 02:13:08.778
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I actually, you know, I kind of liked it.

02:13:08.858 --> 02:13:12.220
[SPEAKER_06]: I liked it better than Tittle Tattle, and I liked it better than their Ultramix 3 remix.

02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:21.625
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think if they DDR cut that, they'd lose a lot of the repetitiveness of the song, and I think it'd be a pretty groovy cut for DDR, so I hope they consider it for Ultramix, what, four?

02:13:22.466 --> 02:13:24.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Or, heck, the next Ultramix will probably be a 360 game.

02:13:24.608 --> 02:13:25.949
[SPEAKER_10]: Ultramix V, Red!

02:13:26.269 --> 02:13:26.670
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix 360.

02:13:28.491 --> 02:13:28.772
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

02:13:28.992 --> 02:13:30.273
[SPEAKER_15]: The Ultramix Purple!

02:13:30.433 --> 02:13:33.275
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is, guys, the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match.

02:13:33.315 --> 02:13:36.398
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number one is Destination Blackout, last week's winner.

02:13:46.467 --> 02:13:49.650
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Doresia with V.

02:13:59.331 --> 02:14:03.606
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Zonk with Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

02:14:13.106 --> 02:14:15.407
[SPEAKER_06]: Place vote now.

02:14:15.507 --> 02:14:18.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

02:14:18.968 --> 02:14:20.528
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you can flood me with private messages.

02:14:20.568 --> 02:14:21.148
[SPEAKER_06]: That's okay.

02:14:21.228 --> 02:14:24.930
[SPEAKER_22]: I need to interrupt for something that's really freaking... Alright, wait.

02:14:25.030 --> 02:14:25.750
[SPEAKER_06]: Place vote now.

02:14:25.770 --> 02:14:26.730
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get to your votes momentarily.

02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:26.950
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

02:14:27.390 --> 02:14:29.311
[SPEAKER_22]: Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico.

02:14:29.431 --> 02:14:30.451
[SPEAKER_22]: This is not from The Onion.

02:14:30.471 --> 02:14:31.612
[SPEAKER_22]: This is from Slashdot.

02:14:33.992 --> 02:14:34.793
[SPEAKER_22]: Armed dolphins?

02:14:34.993 --> 02:14:37.373
[SPEAKER_22]: Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico.

02:14:38.534 --> 02:14:39.354
[SPEAKER_22]: Dolphins don't have arms.

02:14:41.775 --> 02:14:42.095
[SPEAKER_22]: Fiend?

02:14:42.656 --> 02:14:43.016
[SPEAKER_22]: Dolphins?

02:14:44.377 --> 02:14:46.439
[SPEAKER_06]: That sounds like the next Grand Theft Auto game to me.

02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:48.381
[SPEAKER_10]: Are they ill-tempered?

02:14:48.841 --> 02:14:51.824
[SPEAKER_06]: Taking this series where no one has dared take it before.

02:14:52.464 --> 02:14:52.925
[SPEAKER_06]: Dolphins.

02:14:55.047 --> 02:14:59.030
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed my roommate Extrofer is here, so I want to give Extrofer a chance to say something on the show.

02:14:59.090 --> 02:14:59.811
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't zone out on me.

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:02.153
[SPEAKER_08]: Something on the show.

02:15:02.173 --> 02:15:02.393
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

02:15:02.613 --> 02:15:05.356
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, no, actually, we did a segment a couple weeks ago.

02:15:05.376 --> 02:15:08.679
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to bring back this segment, and that would be Extrofer's movie reveal.

02:15:09.846 --> 02:15:10.547
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.

02:15:10.647 --> 02:15:14.054
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so, so, Exifer, give us a movie review on Corpse Bride.

02:15:15.156 --> 02:15:17.661
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, Corpse Bride, it was pretty good.

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:19.744
[SPEAKER_08]: It was good watching.

02:15:20.185 --> 02:15:21.806
[SPEAKER_08]: Excitement in the theater.

02:15:22.086 --> 02:15:22.907
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you for that review.

02:15:23.247 --> 02:15:23.728
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs up?

02:15:23.788 --> 02:15:24.648
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs down?

02:15:24.789 --> 02:15:26.930
[SPEAKER_08]: It was nicely done.

02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:36.618
[SPEAKER_08]: I liked The Nightmare Before Christmas better, but this one definitely was more emotional, more dramatic than The Nightmare Before Christmas.

02:15:37.799 --> 02:15:39.521
[SPEAKER_08]: Anyways, that's my whole take on that.

02:15:39.601 --> 02:15:40.001
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumbs up?

02:15:40.061 --> 02:15:40.542
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumbs down?

02:15:40.622 --> 02:15:41.282
[SPEAKER_06]: Thumbs sideways?

02:15:41.483 --> 02:15:44.125
[SPEAKER_08]: Thumbs diagonal ways?

02:15:45.447 --> 02:15:46.348
[SPEAKER_10]: Diagonal Waves.

02:15:46.508 --> 02:15:47.169
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:15:47.629 --> 02:15:48.230
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

02:15:48.250 --> 02:15:51.392
[SPEAKER_10]: I was starting to think of Margaret Cho's mother, her impression.

02:15:51.973 --> 02:15:53.214
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, my body to jump!

02:15:54.415 --> 02:15:56.157
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, my body was jumping!

02:15:57.598 --> 02:15:57.918
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:15:58.839 --> 02:16:00.380
[SPEAKER_08]: People were exploding in the theater.

02:16:00.480 --> 02:16:01.361
[SPEAKER_08]: It was great.

02:16:02.062 --> 02:16:02.322
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.

02:16:02.522 --> 02:16:03.643
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Extra for that.

02:16:03.963 --> 02:16:06.646
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what movie are you going to see next week that you can review?

02:16:07.723 --> 02:16:13.486
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, well, I'm gonna see Serenity again, but I've already, like, talked that one up like crazy.

02:16:13.586 --> 02:16:16.167
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're gonna have to see two movies, so you have something for us next Sunday.

02:16:16.507 --> 02:16:16.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:16:17.027 --> 02:16:17.687
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't let me down.

02:16:18.148 --> 02:16:18.408
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:16:18.528 --> 02:16:20.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Rent something on Netflix, DVD, I don't know.

02:16:20.709 --> 02:16:21.929
[SPEAKER_06]: Find a movie and review it next week.

02:16:22.349 --> 02:16:22.609
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki?

02:16:24.330 --> 02:16:26.431
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention, I did see a movie.

02:16:26.851 --> 02:16:31.353
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I watched the Reefer Madness, the musical, the movie.

02:16:32.434 --> 02:16:33.094
[SPEAKER_06]: It was great.

02:16:35.566 --> 02:16:36.366
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your name Extifer?

02:16:36.646 --> 02:16:38.407
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you don't do movie reviews on the show.

02:16:39.227 --> 02:16:42.848
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had somebody watch a movie that she has never seen before and it was interesting.

02:16:42.948 --> 02:16:43.348
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

02:16:43.828 --> 02:16:50.350
[SPEAKER_10]: I sat Tia down and let her watch the full Leon.

02:16:52.070 --> 02:16:54.110
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I need to see the full Leon.

02:16:54.130 --> 02:16:55.611
[SPEAKER_10]: She's never seen it at all.

02:16:56.111 --> 02:16:57.211
[SPEAKER_08]: I've only seen the butchered one.

02:16:57.491 --> 02:17:00.172
[SPEAKER_08]: I've never seen the movie at all.

02:17:00.472 --> 02:17:04.573
[SPEAKER_10]: I've already seen it all the way through because I had a French copy of it a while back.

02:17:05.427 --> 02:17:08.668
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, is the uncut version, does he have sex with her or something?

02:17:08.788 --> 02:17:09.308
[SPEAKER_08]: No.

02:17:09.348 --> 02:17:10.228
[SPEAKER_08]: What makes it so uncut?

02:17:10.248 --> 02:17:11.349
[SPEAKER_10]: She kisses him.

02:17:11.929 --> 02:17:12.389
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

02:17:12.949 --> 02:17:14.610
[SPEAKER_10]: It has more of the love story in it.

02:17:15.330 --> 02:17:16.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh.

02:17:16.490 --> 02:17:20.531
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you guys in chat, somebody's freaking out about Serenity.

02:17:20.591 --> 02:17:20.931
[SPEAKER_06]: Where?

02:17:21.412 --> 02:17:22.052
[SPEAKER_06]: It's this Friday.

02:17:22.212 --> 02:17:22.772
[SPEAKER_06]: In the theaters.

02:17:22.872 --> 02:17:23.972
[SPEAKER_06]: This Friday in theaters.

02:17:24.012 --> 02:17:27.773
[SPEAKER_10]: You can check out Yahoo.com, enter in your zip code, and you can find out like the rest of us.

02:17:27.853 --> 02:17:29.794
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's really, really, really, really, really good.

02:17:30.434 --> 02:17:31.774
[SPEAKER_08]: Because you saw a sneak preview, right?

02:17:31.955 --> 02:17:33.115
[SPEAKER_08]: I did see a sneak preview.

02:17:33.215 --> 02:17:33.555
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job.

02:17:33.835 --> 02:17:36.697
[SPEAKER_10]: And it has all the hot men's in it, right?

02:17:37.258 --> 02:17:39.820
[SPEAKER_08]: It has a few hot men's in it.

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:41.281
[SPEAKER_10]: Because I think the captain is hot.

02:17:41.781 --> 02:17:42.702
[SPEAKER_08]: The captain is hot?

02:17:42.742 --> 02:17:45.764
[SPEAKER_10]: I would do him if I wasn't married.

02:17:46.184 --> 02:17:51.448
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're a professional movie reviewer, like you are now on Orange Lounge, you get to advance screenings.

02:17:51.629 --> 02:17:53.150
[SPEAKER_06]: So you should actually get your card out there.

02:17:54.687 --> 02:17:56.668
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you can be our official movie reviewer, okay?

02:17:56.688 --> 02:17:58.189
[SPEAKER_08]: Hello, Extifer OLR.

02:17:59.670 --> 02:18:00.110
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.

02:18:00.150 --> 02:18:01.110
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I get my ticket, please?

02:18:02.211 --> 02:18:03.672
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can get into E3 and everything.

02:18:03.692 --> 02:18:09.695
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, because they'll let professional Extifer movie reviewer in.

02:18:10.575 --> 02:18:12.536
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's get to tonight's Sim Update.

02:18:12.576 --> 02:18:14.117
[SPEAKER_06]: Then we're going to give away some CDs.

02:18:14.477 --> 02:18:19.280
[SPEAKER_06]: Sim Update, Loki, what's going on in the Sim world?

02:18:19.640 --> 02:18:23.122
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I played more Food Mix 2, and it was good, but...

02:18:24.949 --> 02:18:29.550
[SPEAKER_06]: Still nothing really too much else going on other than the release of Food Mix 2 last week.

02:18:31.531 --> 02:18:33.851
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, I think Tourney Mix 6 is over.

02:18:34.131 --> 02:18:35.992
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it is because I'm over with it.

02:18:36.312 --> 02:18:43.394
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's a new, what was it, a new, there's another new file tournament coming up.

02:18:43.754 --> 02:18:45.054
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, nothing going on.

02:18:45.214 --> 02:18:46.135
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing at all.

02:18:46.355 --> 02:18:47.955
[SPEAKER_06]: Just play Food Mix 2 and wait it out.

02:18:49.755 --> 02:18:52.297
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to fill time with something because I'm tallying cage match votes here.

02:18:52.357 --> 02:18:53.438
[SPEAKER_06]: Last call for cage match votes.

02:18:53.458 --> 02:18:56.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, since I'm filling time.

02:18:56.340 --> 02:19:00.264
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I need some alcohol.

02:19:00.284 --> 02:19:00.324
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:19:00.484 --> 02:19:02.866
[SPEAKER_06]: What was it?

02:19:02.906 --> 02:19:04.247
[SPEAKER_06]: Reefer Madison the movie is awesome.

02:19:05.288 --> 02:19:06.589
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, it's so funny.

02:19:06.609 --> 02:19:09.291
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got, let's see who was in it.

02:19:09.331 --> 02:19:12.634
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got just a lot of funny people.

02:19:13.134 --> 02:19:14.155
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of funny people.

02:19:14.465 --> 02:19:15.686
[SPEAKER_06]: This is some Showtime thing.

02:19:16.066 --> 02:19:17.467
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually want to see the stage play of it.

02:19:17.948 --> 02:19:19.169
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked really neat.

02:19:19.609 --> 02:19:22.732
[SPEAKER_06]: It's basically an anti-marijuana movie.

02:19:23.232 --> 02:19:24.233
[SPEAKER_06]: Or was, supposedly.

02:19:24.273 --> 02:19:27.435
[SPEAKER_06]: It's based off a 1930s propaganda film put out by the government.

02:19:28.576 --> 02:19:31.819
[SPEAKER_06]: Where basically people smoke pot and then they turn into zombies and kill people.

02:19:32.379 --> 02:19:35.202
[SPEAKER_06]: And have sex and turn into whores and worship saints.

02:19:35.222 --> 02:19:36.362
[SPEAKER_06]: That makes me want to smoke pot.

02:19:37.764 --> 02:19:38.424
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great movie.

02:19:40.085 --> 02:19:41.467
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, so basically... Shit!

02:19:42.547 --> 02:19:43.048
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit!

02:19:43.652 --> 02:19:44.633
[SPEAKER_06]: Trick, if you're a fag

02:20:05.971 --> 02:20:07.872
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, who else was in this?

02:20:08.473 --> 02:20:13.476
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, fellow SNL cast member Ana Gustair was in it.

02:20:13.796 --> 02:20:14.116
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

02:20:14.756 --> 02:20:15.437
[SPEAKER_06]: She was hilarious.

02:20:15.517 --> 02:20:18.318
[SPEAKER_06]: Love her impersonation of Martha Stewart, topless Halloween special.

02:20:20.039 --> 02:20:20.900
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas special.

02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:21.881
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

02:20:22.381 --> 02:20:23.682
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was pretty funny.

02:20:24.302 --> 02:20:25.162
[SPEAKER_06]: I highly recommend it.

02:20:25.183 --> 02:20:25.623
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out.

02:20:25.683 --> 02:20:29.865
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be packaged with the actual 1930s movie as well.

02:20:30.266 --> 02:20:30.806
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really funny.

02:20:31.026 --> 02:20:32.127
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.

02:20:32.207 --> 02:20:33.868
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually, I need to ask Eksta for something.

02:20:34.128 --> 02:20:34.328
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:20:34.348 --> 02:20:34.428
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

02:20:34.853 --> 02:20:40.637
[SPEAKER_10]: My friend in her live journal described Corpse Bride, and I want to see if you agree with her description.

02:20:40.917 --> 02:20:41.177
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:20:41.717 --> 02:20:45.660
[SPEAKER_10]: Corpse Bride was one of those nice, heartwarming tales that touches you in all the wrong places.

02:20:49.102 --> 02:20:52.684
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I didn't feel physically touched by it.

02:20:53.045 --> 02:20:55.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Show me on the doll where Corpse Bride touched you.

02:20:56.066 --> 02:20:57.607
[SPEAKER_08]: It touched me in the pee-pee.

02:20:58.488 --> 02:20:58.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.

02:20:59.849 --> 02:21:00.289
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:21:00.789 --> 02:21:01.450
[SPEAKER_06]: It felt good.

02:21:06.161 --> 02:21:09.342
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I think we need to save this show by giving something away.

02:21:09.682 --> 02:21:10.422
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

02:21:10.522 --> 02:21:11.763
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's give some shit away.

02:21:12.423 --> 02:21:17.705
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, pull a number out of the hat, which actually would be your ass in this case, because we don't really have a hat.

02:21:17.985 --> 02:21:20.805
[SPEAKER_06]: So pull a number out of your ass, and who's our winner?

02:21:21.146 --> 02:21:22.046
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll pull it out of my boobs.

02:21:22.506 --> 02:21:23.046
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, do that.

02:21:23.326 --> 02:21:23.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's our winner?

02:21:24.707 --> 02:21:25.227
[SPEAKER_10]: Number eight.

02:21:25.527 --> 02:21:29.208
[SPEAKER_06]: Number eight.

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:31.909
[SPEAKER_06]: Our lucky winner tonight is...

02:21:33.308 --> 02:21:36.910
[SPEAKER_06]: Fireboma won tonight's V-Rare.

02:21:36.930 --> 02:21:43.413
[SPEAKER_06]: He won a copy of the EX-2 and Max-2 V-Rare.

02:21:43.473 --> 02:21:48.195
[SPEAKER_06]: So Fireboma, check your email in about five minutes because I'm going to be looking for your address.

02:21:48.255 --> 02:21:49.736
[SPEAKER_06]: But you need to send that to a different account.

02:21:49.776 --> 02:21:50.536
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't send that to the...

02:21:52.523 --> 02:21:53.023
[SPEAKER_06]: Free Stuff 1.

02:21:53.463 --> 02:21:59.666
[SPEAKER_06]: Now if you didn't win, you guys, if you didn't win, don't worry because you are already entered because you're a live show listener.

02:22:00.046 --> 02:22:01.326
[SPEAKER_06]: You actually get two shots at this.

02:22:01.646 --> 02:22:04.167
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really kissing your ass because you take time on Sunday nights to listen to this.

02:22:04.467 --> 02:22:11.610
[SPEAKER_06]: You automatically are entered into the drawing that we're going to do next Sunday, which our whole podcast now it's opened up to.

02:22:11.890 --> 02:22:13.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Please do not send another email.

02:22:13.591 --> 02:22:14.491
[SPEAKER_06]: You're already in it.

02:22:14.631 --> 02:22:15.571
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to send another one.

02:22:15.871 --> 02:22:17.132
[SPEAKER_06]: So look forward to that.

02:22:18.476 --> 02:22:18.857
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:22:19.317 --> 02:22:22.082
[SPEAKER_06]: So, sorry to those of you guys who didn't win, but you have a second chance.

02:22:22.222 --> 02:22:22.783
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a second chance.

02:22:22.823 --> 02:22:24.806
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll do that next week.

02:22:25.226 --> 02:22:30.113
[SPEAKER_06]: So, congratulations, Fireboma, who apparently left chat and went to bed.

02:22:30.374 --> 02:22:30.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

02:22:31.823 --> 02:22:32.463
[SPEAKER_11]: Firebomba.

02:22:32.523 --> 02:22:34.204
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that disqualifies him.

02:22:34.264 --> 02:22:35.725
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we can't disqualify him.

02:22:35.805 --> 02:22:37.186
[SPEAKER_06]: He won fair and square.

02:22:37.266 --> 02:22:37.807
[SPEAKER_06]: He won.

02:22:38.527 --> 02:22:39.307
[SPEAKER_06]: Bastard.

02:22:39.808 --> 02:22:40.888
[SPEAKER_06]: Leaving and going to sleep.

02:22:41.409 --> 02:22:41.689
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:22:41.709 --> 02:22:42.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Who needs sleep?

02:22:42.609 --> 02:22:43.670
[SPEAKER_10]: Sleep is for weenies.

02:22:43.710 --> 02:22:43.950
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:22:44.370 --> 02:22:48.193
[SPEAKER_06]: And some folks in chat say they want the Max 2 VRare still very bad.

02:22:48.213 --> 02:22:53.836
[SPEAKER_06]: And they heard me slip up earlier and say that we actually have three Max 2 VRares and two EX2s.

02:22:53.876 --> 02:22:56.117
[SPEAKER_06]: So we will find a way to give those away.

02:22:56.698 --> 02:22:57.098
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

02:22:57.478 --> 02:22:58.399
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe a bonus?

02:22:58.919 --> 02:22:59.159
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

02:22:59.279 --> 02:22:59.619
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

02:22:59.699 --> 02:23:00.019
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

02:23:00.600 --> 02:23:01.740
[SPEAKER_06]: We might give away a bonus or something.

02:23:02.401 --> 02:23:05.862
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, congratulations to Narcoleptic Firebomber who won.

02:23:08.244 --> 02:23:08.924
[SPEAKER_06]: I see how it is.

02:23:08.964 --> 02:23:10.865
[SPEAKER_06]: You enter the contest and then leave us.

02:23:11.125 --> 02:23:14.447
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody should send him a copy of this show where we're just razzing on him for not being here.

02:23:15.467 --> 02:23:17.850
[SPEAKER_06]: How dare sleep be more important than Orange Lounge?

02:23:18.050 --> 02:23:20.673
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the people who leave us to go watch Family Guy.

02:23:20.993 --> 02:23:23.917
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, Family Guy this season has not been funny.

02:23:24.237 --> 02:23:25.158
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been great.

02:23:25.218 --> 02:23:27.421
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if we... Have we been watching the same show?

02:23:27.921 --> 02:23:31.305
[SPEAKER_06]: Family Guy is a great show, don't get me wrong, but the last two episodes this season have been...

02:23:31.946 --> 02:23:34.987
[SPEAKER_06]: I got linked to a disturbing TV Tokyo page for an anime called Ice Shield 21.

02:23:35.027 --> 02:23:36.248
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about American football.

02:23:36.328 --> 02:23:38.329
[SPEAKER_06]: I find that hilarious and I oddly want to see it.

02:23:55.765 --> 02:23:56.745
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're going to go to a break.

02:24:21.423 --> 02:24:24.190
[SPEAKER_06]: Sharpen your quills because you're going to be doing some writing.

02:24:24.411 --> 02:24:28.802
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll get to the details on that contest when we come back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:24:45.805 --> 02:24:46.467
Thanks for watching!

02:25:19.264 --> 02:25:20.065
Thanks for watching!

02:28:05.096 --> 02:28:09.561
[SPEAKER_15]: Love or truth, this is what I prove between me and you.

02:28:09.601 --> 02:28:12.744
[SPEAKER_15]: Love or truth, whichever you choose is for me.

02:29:32.404 --> 02:29:33.986
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

02:30:09.575 --> 02:30:10.197
Thanks for watching!

02:30:57.028 --> 02:30:58.753
Thank you for watching!

02:31:59.119 --> 02:32:05.062
[SPEAKER_10]: Mr. Random Person on the Street, who, by the way, is not an actor, what do you think of the Orange Lounge mainlining music in more shows?

02:32:05.082 --> 02:32:12.226
[SPEAKER_12]: The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place.

02:32:12.566 --> 02:32:14.547
[SPEAKER_12]: It's unearthly.

02:32:14.787 --> 02:32:18.529
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like being in a club, except you don't have to actually ask someone to dance.

02:32:19.390 --> 02:32:19.870
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:32:20.250 --> 02:32:22.051
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:32:22.151 --> 02:32:22.692
[SPEAKER_06]: Here we are.

02:32:23.192 --> 02:32:23.432
[SPEAKER_06]: Another...

02:32:24.302 --> 02:32:52.061
[SPEAKER_06]: Show, almost to a close, we got a good half hour of show left And we got still the FUs to get to, and all sorts of other stuff as well First off though, what I wanted to do I was gonna, oh man, I was trying to find this sound file I had If you're doing what I think you're doing, you can just stop it Stop it

02:32:53.450 --> 02:32:54.451
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know where it went.

02:32:54.511 --> 02:32:55.232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so sad.

02:33:14.492 --> 02:33:16.713
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we all started giggling and Loki's like, shut up!

02:33:18.194 --> 02:33:19.515
[SPEAKER_10]: I was being serious.

02:33:19.635 --> 02:33:21.296
[SPEAKER_10]: It really is a lot of fun.

02:33:21.696 --> 02:33:22.497
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's really funny.

02:33:22.557 --> 02:33:25.038
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a lot better than Final Fantasy XI, number one.

02:33:25.478 --> 02:33:26.439
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, shut your pie hole.

02:33:26.719 --> 02:33:27.019
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:33:27.459 --> 02:33:29.160
[SPEAKER_10]: You've never played it, so you don't know.

02:33:29.260 --> 02:33:29.701
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen it.

02:33:29.721 --> 02:33:32.002
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't have to party with stupid people.

02:33:32.162 --> 02:33:33.823
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't trash on World of Warcraft, though.

02:33:33.923 --> 02:33:34.783
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's okay.

02:33:34.903 --> 02:33:36.364
[SPEAKER_06]: I just, you know, I'm obsessed with it.

02:33:36.384 --> 02:33:40.386
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, no, no, no, no, because I'm very bitter toward Final Fantasy XI because of the idiots.

02:33:40.627 --> 02:33:41.047
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I know.

02:33:41.667 --> 02:33:46.032
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it's like, hi, I'm going to give you warning before I decide to buff everybody.

02:33:46.653 --> 02:33:52.659
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm half tempted that if, you know, I give you a 20 second delay to get there before I cast the shit.

02:33:53.060 --> 02:33:54.581
[SPEAKER_10]: And if they're not there, screw it.

02:33:54.722 --> 02:33:55.562
[SPEAKER_10]: No haste for you.

02:33:57.825 --> 02:33:58.185
[SPEAKER_06]: You done?

02:33:58.386 --> 02:33:58.706
[SPEAKER_06]: Feel better?

02:33:59.654 --> 02:33:59.955
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:34:00.355 --> 02:34:02.378
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they make white mages bitches in that game.

02:34:02.418 --> 02:34:06.983
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go from one rant to another.

02:34:07.524 --> 02:34:10.268
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove, we have completely defaced this copy of In the Groove.

02:34:10.328 --> 02:34:12.270
[SPEAKER_06]: Extifer, you actually need to add something to this too.

02:34:12.450 --> 02:34:13.512
[SPEAKER_06]: Inside now.

02:34:13.732 --> 02:34:14.713
[SPEAKER_06]: This has been defaced, huh?

02:34:16.710 --> 02:34:18.731
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:34:47.153 --> 02:34:51.014
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Orange Lounge Radio haiku contest.

02:34:51.515 --> 02:34:56.096
[SPEAKER_06]: What you have to do is you have to write a haiku about In The Groove.

02:34:56.656 --> 02:35:02.098
[SPEAKER_06]: And we, the hosts of Orange Lounge Radio, will pick our favorite, and that will be the winner of this.

02:35:02.538 --> 02:35:07.540
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is totally up to the three of us, whatever judging criteria we want to use, we will pick our favorite.

02:35:07.560 --> 02:35:09.061
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is one little catch.

02:35:09.141 --> 02:35:10.181
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, tell them about the catch.

02:35:10.895 --> 02:35:13.718
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not in traditional haiku format, first of all.

02:35:14.758 --> 02:35:15.579
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, sort of.

02:35:16.260 --> 02:35:19.162
[SPEAKER_10]: Your first line must be five syllables.

02:35:20.503 --> 02:35:22.665
[SPEAKER_10]: Your second line must be seven syllables.

02:35:22.905 --> 02:35:24.506
[SPEAKER_10]: And your last line must be three.

02:35:25.827 --> 02:35:32.032
[SPEAKER_06]: Ah, so instead of 5-7-5, you have to do a 5-7-3 haiku.

02:35:32.233 --> 02:35:33.954
[SPEAKER_06]: We call this the OLR format.

02:35:33.974 --> 02:35:35.035
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, the OLR format.

02:35:35.075 --> 02:35:39.779
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you catch on to what 5-7-3 means, congratulations, you're a dork.

02:35:41.653 --> 02:35:45.196
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so it's the 5-7-3 haiku that you have to do.

02:35:45.916 --> 02:35:52.722
[SPEAKER_06]: Send your entries, the 5-7-3 haiku on In The Groove to haiku at orangeloungeradio.com.

02:35:53.242 --> 02:35:53.822
[SPEAKER_06]: Haiku.

02:35:55.003 --> 02:35:56.885
[SPEAKER_06]: H-I-K-U.

02:35:59.821 --> 02:36:00.482
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

02:36:20.638 --> 02:36:26.640
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't think that just because you can't write, you have a whole week to think about this, kids.

02:36:26.840 --> 02:36:28.221
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a whole week, at least.

02:36:28.461 --> 02:36:31.602
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you don't know how to write, then go back to school.

02:36:31.622 --> 02:36:32.242
[SPEAKER_06]: 5-7-3.

02:36:32.503 --> 02:36:33.823
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all you need.

02:36:33.843 --> 02:36:34.263
[SPEAKER_06]: 5-7-3.

02:36:35.244 --> 02:36:36.724
[SPEAKER_06]: Five syllables, seven syllables, three syllables.

02:36:36.764 --> 02:36:37.965
[SPEAKER_06]: The favorite will win.

02:36:38.065 --> 02:36:39.185
[SPEAKER_06]: Send those entries to Haiku.

02:36:39.465 --> 02:36:42.646
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you that can't spell, H-A-I-K-U.

02:36:42.707 --> 02:36:44.747
[SPEAKER_06]: Haiku at OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:36:44.787 --> 02:36:45.728
[SPEAKER_06]: And we will pick our favorite.

02:36:46.268 --> 02:36:47.308
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is Ukiah backward.

02:36:48.329 --> 02:36:49.029
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for that.

02:36:51.035 --> 02:36:52.116
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the way I remember it, oddly.

02:37:16.226 --> 02:37:16.666
[SPEAKER_10]: You can't!

02:37:16.726 --> 02:37:17.747
[SPEAKER_10]: It's in permanent marker!

02:37:18.208 --> 02:37:18.928
[SPEAKER_06]: And pink pen.

02:37:20.469 --> 02:37:22.871
[SPEAKER_10]: And on top of that, this is no longer in the groove.

02:37:23.071 --> 02:37:24.752
[SPEAKER_10]: It's, I stepped in the poop.

02:37:26.854 --> 02:37:27.134
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:37:28.475 --> 02:37:30.176
[SPEAKER_06]: 573 Haiku about in the groove.

02:37:30.216 --> 02:37:32.758
[SPEAKER_06]: Send those to haiku at orange launch radio dot com.

02:37:33.099 --> 02:37:38.723
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, now I'm sure a lot of people are getting angsty here, so it's time to do the FUs of the week.

02:37:39.163 --> 02:37:40.564
[SPEAKER_06]: The FUs of the week.

02:37:40.584 --> 02:37:40.844
[SPEAKER_06]: Huh?

02:37:40.864 --> 02:37:43.947
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you want to know the cage match winner?

02:37:43.987 --> 02:37:45.428
[SPEAKER_06]: I suppose we should do that as well, shouldn't we?

02:37:48.075 --> 02:37:49.676
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I always forget to do the cage match winner.

02:37:51.077 --> 02:37:54.740
[SPEAKER_06]: Tonight's cage match winner was kind of a landslide.

02:37:55.201 --> 02:38:05.508
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't be a surprise with this crowd that V by Dorsaria wins tonight's cage match because you guys are whores for V. Tools, all of you.

02:38:07.030 --> 02:38:07.370
[SPEAKER_06]: Sheep.

02:38:08.971 --> 02:38:09.151
Sure.

02:38:10.052 --> 02:38:10.752
[SPEAKER_06]: You're all a bunch of sheep.

02:38:15.034 --> 02:38:16.815
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of Loki's V-Mix.

02:38:40.396 --> 02:38:41.136
[SPEAKER_10]: That's my week.

02:38:42.317 --> 02:38:48.120
[SPEAKER_10]: A big F you just to being stuck by myself while my man's off in Texas.

02:38:48.160 --> 02:38:51.641
[SPEAKER_10]: I wish my job would send me to Texas randomly.

02:38:52.742 --> 02:38:56.824
[SPEAKER_10]: So that I'm like, you know, not anywhere near California.

02:38:57.544 --> 02:39:05.747
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, FU goes to jury duty sort of halfway because I actually wanted to go so that I could sleep in about two hours more than normal.

02:39:06.567 --> 02:39:11.008
[SPEAKER_10]: And, uh, no, I have to go to work and then check back at 11 to see if I have to go.

02:39:11.228 --> 02:39:12.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I get to go the week after.

02:39:13.329 --> 02:39:13.829
[SPEAKER_10]: Good for you.

02:39:14.289 --> 02:39:15.210
[SPEAKER_10]: I bet you feel special.

02:39:15.610 --> 02:39:16.510
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I hate it.

02:39:17.369 --> 02:39:18.250
[SPEAKER_10]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:39:44.164 --> 02:39:48.046
[SPEAKER_10]: But if it's like some really rich and powerful person, I don't want to do that because then they hunt down the jury.

02:39:49.106 --> 02:39:51.968
[SPEAKER_10]: Or they're convicted for being morons.

02:39:52.268 --> 02:39:54.249
[SPEAKER_10]: I really want to nail a stupid person though.

02:39:54.289 --> 02:39:56.870
[SPEAKER_10]: I want to be on the jury for like someone who did something really stupid.

02:39:56.890 --> 02:40:00.612
[SPEAKER_10]: Because they go, ah, you're stupid and guilty.

02:40:01.913 --> 02:40:06.315
[SPEAKER_10]: F you to, and I hate saying F you to my man because I love him so much.

02:40:07.415 --> 02:40:23.400
[SPEAKER_10]: But after me being so lonely and missing him so much, he comes home and wakes my ass up by banging on the metal door and then fusses at me, accusing me of not doing the dishes, which I did the dishes three times while he was gone, okay?

02:40:24.220 --> 02:40:26.641
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, it was just because I had company last night.

02:40:27.181 --> 02:40:34.103
[SPEAKER_10]: And then, and then, I'm, you know, doing homework and he, no, he says he's taking a shower, so I start doing my homework.

02:40:34.824 --> 02:40:36.085
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he's gone.

02:40:36.185 --> 02:40:37.025
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where he is.

02:40:37.105 --> 02:40:37.945
[SPEAKER_10]: So I finish my homework.

02:40:37.965 --> 02:40:38.906
[SPEAKER_10]: I put up my puppies.

02:40:39.326 --> 02:40:41.387
[SPEAKER_10]: I get started on working on another project.

02:40:41.447 --> 02:40:43.708
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he comes up and says, Oh yeah, I told you I was going across the street.

02:40:44.388 --> 02:40:44.948
[SPEAKER_10]: No you didn't!

02:40:45.328 --> 02:40:47.129
[SPEAKER_10]: And if you did, you need to make sure that I heard you.

02:40:48.163 --> 02:40:50.264
[SPEAKER_10]: And then he says, you would come play Madden with us?

02:40:50.524 --> 02:41:09.390
[SPEAKER_10]: And I hate, like, American football more than anything, just about, except for idiots, because most of the time it really is, you know, I think of football and I think of big, fat, ugly, butt-toothed rednecks, you know, the stereotypical redneck, drinking a beer, you know, drinking a Bud or a Coors, something nasty.

02:41:10.362 --> 02:41:16.425
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, in a wife beater and, you know, torn up jeans or shorts or like boxers or something.

02:41:16.445 --> 02:41:20.247
[SPEAKER_10]: I have this mental image because I have actually seen it.

02:41:20.887 --> 02:41:22.508
[SPEAKER_10]: Multiple times in different places.

02:41:22.608 --> 02:41:23.489
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually in Mississippi.

02:41:24.149 --> 02:41:25.950
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, so yeah.

02:41:26.871 --> 02:41:27.391
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't.

02:41:28.691 --> 02:41:29.392
[SPEAKER_10]: I was so mad.

02:41:29.672 --> 02:41:30.833
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I come here mad.

02:41:31.313 --> 02:41:33.594
[SPEAKER_10]: And then I still don't have my game.

02:41:36.756 --> 02:41:37.916
[SPEAKER_06]: Which irks me.

02:41:38.076 --> 02:41:38.677
[SPEAKER_06]: The K game.

02:41:38.877 --> 02:41:39.377
[SPEAKER_10]: The K game.

02:41:40.660 --> 02:41:42.880
[SPEAKER_04]: Loki's turn, boys and girls!

02:42:06.540 --> 02:42:13.424
[SPEAKER_06]: My first FU is going to be going to a demographic of people I usually don't hit up quite as often as I do about bad drivers who are women.

02:42:13.744 --> 02:42:15.345
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is bad drivers who are old.

02:42:16.285 --> 02:42:17.206
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, for example...

02:42:17.677 --> 02:42:24.339
[SPEAKER_06]: We had retard old person today who decided stop means don't stop, stop means just keep going through.

02:42:24.779 --> 02:42:38.403
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I'm on my way to Best Buy today, you know, I make a left or a right hand turn on a four-way stop and I go through there and dumb old guy slows down briefly and then goes nearly like rear-ending my car.

02:42:39.003 --> 02:42:46.690
[SPEAKER_06]: So then I'm pulling up to the stop, um, the next stop sign, which is a two, you know, a three-way stop, and dumbass pulls up next to me.

02:42:46.951 --> 02:42:58.041
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no other lane, there's only one lane, and he's trying to create his own lane, and so I go and he goes right next to me, thus creating his own lane, I guess, because he's old and stupid and his car sucked.

02:42:58.581 --> 02:43:02.425
[SPEAKER_06]: So, fuck you, the old people, because you can't drive and you need to be off the road.

02:43:03.884 --> 02:43:06.027
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're not the only old person that's done this.

02:43:06.207 --> 02:43:10.050
[SPEAKER_06]: There are other old people that drive too slow, other old people that don't look at where they're going.

02:43:10.451 --> 02:43:14.915
[SPEAKER_06]: Whenever I see a car on the road, it's of one of a couple criteria.

02:43:15.376 --> 02:43:16.737
[SPEAKER_06]: Woman or old person.

02:43:17.057 --> 02:43:18.759
[SPEAKER_06]: Or an old woman, which is the worst.

02:43:19.640 --> 02:43:23.143
[SPEAKER_06]: The bigger the hair, the slower they drive, so... Yeah.

02:43:23.944 --> 02:43:24.084
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:43:26.044 --> 02:43:29.666
[SPEAKER_10]: I do have to say that there was a guy probably about in his early 20s.

02:43:30.386 --> 02:43:37.629
[SPEAKER_10]: There's this one intersection by Red Robin going on Sunrise for anyone who lives in the area where you have two left turn lanes.

02:43:38.169 --> 02:43:39.909
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them turns right and can go straight too.

02:43:40.570 --> 02:43:45.651
[SPEAKER_10]: And then there's actually two left lanes.

02:43:46.812 --> 02:43:49.553
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the guy pulls into the opposite traffic lane as a turn lane.

02:43:52.797 --> 02:43:55.558
[SPEAKER_10]: And we roll down the window and go, um, hey, you, over here.

02:43:55.638 --> 02:43:57.419
[SPEAKER_10]: And he's, like, driving, like, a Camaro.

02:43:58.940 --> 02:43:59.360
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite?

02:44:00.601 --> 02:44:01.541
[SPEAKER_06]: It was no bitchin' Camaro.

02:44:02.462 --> 02:44:03.162
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a guy.

02:44:04.483 --> 02:44:06.524
[SPEAKER_06]: My favorite, though, is the guys that, you know, pull up.

02:44:07.024 --> 02:44:08.385
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the left turn lane, okay?

02:44:08.405 --> 02:44:11.766
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only a left turn lane and, you know, a lane that goes straight and right.

02:44:12.266 --> 02:44:19.610
[SPEAKER_06]: And this guy pulls up into oncoming traffic, goes to the left of the left turn lane, and makes a left turn when the light's just green to go straight.

02:44:20.896 --> 02:44:25.600
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, holy crap, you just completely ignored every single traffic law right there.

02:44:26.021 --> 02:44:34.989
[SPEAKER_06]: I had another lady today in her van pull straight through the red, um, through the stop sign, just didn't even slow down, just went 50 miles an hour through the stop sign.

02:44:35.249 --> 02:44:36.090
[SPEAKER_06]: Three hour show, Loki.

02:44:40.194 --> 02:44:46.560
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, Rob, I'm going to talk really fast then.

02:44:48.442 --> 02:44:54.307
[SPEAKER_06]: So, my other F.U.

02:44:56.729 --> 02:45:08.078
[SPEAKER_06]: was to screaming kids in the movie last night.

02:45:09.059 --> 02:45:09.299
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

02:45:17.546 --> 02:45:20.148
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Loki for being a jackass.

02:45:20.468 --> 02:45:22.510
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to Renie in chatroom for calling me a liar.

02:45:23.230 --> 02:45:25.352
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope your copy of EX2 is scratched and doesn't work.

02:45:25.993 --> 02:45:26.413
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kidding.

02:45:26.573 --> 02:45:27.634
[SPEAKER_06]: Heart.

02:45:28.835 --> 02:45:33.438
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to this pink thing that I have on my desk.

02:45:33.819 --> 02:45:36.761
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know what it is, but I always want to play with it.

02:45:37.581 --> 02:45:38.262
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know why.

02:45:38.282 --> 02:45:40.784
[SPEAKER_06]: You know how they have training wheels?

02:45:40.804 --> 02:45:41.805
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, that's a training cock ring.

02:45:41.945 --> 02:45:43.606
[SPEAKER_06]: No, this is not a training cock ring.

02:45:44.106 --> 02:45:44.907
[SPEAKER_06]: This would never fit.

02:45:45.507 --> 02:45:45.828
[SPEAKER_06]: This is...

02:45:46.488 --> 02:45:48.049
[SPEAKER_06]: It was on a CD spindle, I think.

02:45:48.069 --> 02:45:49.669
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's so small.

02:45:49.709 --> 02:45:51.049
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can't stop playing with it.

02:45:51.109 --> 02:45:51.730
[SPEAKER_06]: It's smooshy.

02:45:52.170 --> 02:45:56.031
[SPEAKER_06]: I should send this to a contest winner so it's out of my house.

02:45:56.131 --> 02:45:56.831
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe I'll do that.

02:45:57.691 --> 02:45:59.732
[SPEAKER_06]: You can play with this, too.

02:46:00.152 --> 02:46:02.513
[SPEAKER_06]: My finger's been in this hole I don't know how many times.

02:46:04.493 --> 02:46:05.294
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to sign it?

02:46:05.374 --> 02:46:06.094
[SPEAKER_06]: I have sharpies.

02:46:07.105 --> 02:46:10.969
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to cut that little clip of the show and make a YTMND out of it.

02:46:13.812 --> 02:46:14.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, Loki.

02:46:16.455 --> 02:46:17.776
[SPEAKER_06]: I should send that to a random listener.

02:46:18.677 --> 02:46:18.997
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

02:46:22.821 --> 02:46:23.962
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, what else do I have in FU?

02:46:24.002 --> 02:46:25.224
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not going to sign it and give it away.

02:46:25.264 --> 02:46:26.105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my pink thing.

02:46:26.145 --> 02:46:28.127
[SPEAKER_06]: The listeners can get their own pink thing.

02:46:28.947 --> 02:46:30.229
[SPEAKER_06]: I bet you many of them do.

02:46:31.375 --> 02:46:32.816
[SPEAKER_06]: and, um... Shut up.

02:46:35.438 --> 02:46:43.064
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh... An F you to, um... me having to clean house this week because we have company over this weekend and I don't want to clean.

02:46:43.605 --> 02:46:44.365
[SPEAKER_06]: Cleaning sucks.

02:46:45.246 --> 02:46:46.747
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a robot that cleans for me.

02:46:47.728 --> 02:46:48.388
[SPEAKER_06]: I should get married.

02:46:48.408 --> 02:46:48.969
[SPEAKER_10]: You need Rosie.

02:46:50.290 --> 02:46:51.391
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, from the Jetsons?

02:46:51.511 --> 02:46:52.672
[SPEAKER_10]: You need Rosie from the Jetsons.

02:46:54.113 --> 02:46:54.473
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

02:46:54.673 --> 02:46:57.736
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go to some other F yous including those in-house.

02:46:57.776 --> 02:46:59.137
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk to, um...

02:47:00.359 --> 02:47:00.619
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugged!

02:47:00.939 --> 02:47:01.480
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your F.U.

02:47:01.500 --> 02:47:01.820
[SPEAKER_06]: this week?

02:47:02.260 --> 02:47:02.441
[SPEAKER_22]: F.U.

02:47:02.461 --> 02:47:12.008
[SPEAKER_22]: to the giant scratch somebody put on my hood Thursday night when I was in San Jose getting blasted off my ass at the Tide House for a birthday party.

02:47:13.629 --> 02:47:14.129
[SPEAKER_22]: Second F.U.

02:47:14.169 --> 02:47:24.877
[SPEAKER_22]: to Maximum Tune at UC Davis for gleefully accepting my card and then telling me, hey, drop three more bucks and we'll import your card data to another card that'll work with our machine.

02:47:26.358 --> 02:47:27.539
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, right.

02:47:28.513 --> 02:47:31.055
[SPEAKER_22]: and FU for Netflix for not working damn faster.

02:47:31.996 --> 02:47:35.079
[SPEAKER_22]: I want that movie the next fucking day, not the day after.

02:47:36.901 --> 02:47:38.462
[SPEAKER_22]: Use wormholes or some shit like that.

02:47:42.205 --> 02:47:42.506
[SPEAKER_07]: That's it.

02:47:42.706 --> 02:47:42.966
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

02:47:43.487 --> 02:47:43.767
[SPEAKER_07]: Garrett.

02:47:46.029 --> 02:47:51.173
[SPEAKER_07]: An FU to eBears who sell forged autographs on items.

02:47:53.175 --> 02:47:54.116
[SPEAKER_08]: That was short and sweet.

02:47:54.617 --> 02:47:54.977
[SPEAKER_08]: Extaper.

02:47:57.341 --> 02:48:02.037
[SPEAKER_08]: F you to guys that say the exact wrong thing during sex.

02:48:06.909 --> 02:48:07.129
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.

02:48:07.329 --> 02:48:08.550
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, you want the story?

02:48:08.670 --> 02:48:10.051
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay then, Extifer.

02:48:10.491 --> 02:48:11.992
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, Extifer.

02:48:12.112 --> 02:48:17.195
[SPEAKER_08]: Tell us all about your sex, or I'm sorry, of sex that your friend had.

02:48:17.455 --> 02:48:23.139
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, we were busy having sex, and he says... Oh, look at that!

02:48:23.239 --> 02:48:23.519
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that!

02:48:23.539 --> 02:48:24.960
[SPEAKER_08]: We just lost half our listeners!

02:48:25.080 --> 02:48:25.800
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, Extifer!

02:48:25.861 --> 02:48:26.581
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, no problem.

02:48:26.941 --> 02:48:27.962
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm still talking.

02:48:28.522 --> 02:48:32.505
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, so, I have... I'm sorry, I forgot this was the Extifer show!

02:48:32.725 --> 02:48:32.865
[SPEAKER_08]: What...

02:48:33.385 --> 02:48:33.926
[SPEAKER_08]: My dad.

02:48:34.086 --> 02:48:35.387
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, thanks for remembering.

02:48:36.048 --> 02:48:46.698
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I, so basically he stops as, you know, we're into it and he says something like, yeah, so I'm not in the mood for getting into a relationship right now.

02:48:47.279 --> 02:48:52.123
[SPEAKER_08]: And I looked at him and I said, why are you going to say something stupid like that while we're having sex?

02:48:52.183 --> 02:48:53.845
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, sex is stupid.

02:48:54.245 --> 02:48:55.947
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't have a brain when you're having sex.

02:48:55.987 --> 02:48:56.648
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't think.

02:48:57.168 --> 02:48:58.649
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't say things that you think of.

02:48:59.189 --> 02:49:00.229
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm like, unless they're dirty.

02:49:00.409 --> 02:49:01.530
[SPEAKER_08]: You say dirty things.

02:49:01.670 --> 02:49:03.371
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can think of very many dirty things.

02:49:03.651 --> 02:49:05.952
[SPEAKER_08]: I can probably say a bunch of them right now if I wanted to.

02:49:06.452 --> 02:49:07.052
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, why not?

02:49:07.472 --> 02:49:08.393
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes, dishes.

02:49:08.433 --> 02:49:09.473
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure, give us an example.

02:49:09.573 --> 02:49:09.913
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?

02:49:09.953 --> 02:49:11.374
[SPEAKER_08]: The listeners are already scared as it is.

02:49:11.954 --> 02:49:18.336
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, like the normals, suck my cock, you know, stick your tongue up my ass, you know, stuff like that.

02:49:19.677 --> 02:49:23.919
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, you don't want to say something that's actually, you know, somewhat...

02:49:25.644 --> 02:49:28.906
[SPEAKER_08]: I got limp.

02:49:32.688 --> 02:49:36.250
[SPEAKER_08]: It's very difficult for me to talk about something like that during sex.

02:49:36.610 --> 02:49:39.772
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I, you know, fuck you to that.

02:49:40.573 --> 02:49:40.913
[SPEAKER_08]: To him.

02:49:44.715 --> 02:49:46.035
[SPEAKER_08]: And we are done.

02:49:47.456 --> 02:49:48.557
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, we're not, Extover.

02:49:48.577 --> 02:49:49.898
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to get to the chatroom FUs.

02:49:50.658 --> 02:49:51.678
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, okay.

02:49:51.699 --> 02:49:53.700
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're done with the Extover show for now.

02:49:53.720 --> 02:49:54.000
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:49:54.240 --> 02:49:54.460
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:49:56.837 --> 02:49:58.918
[SPEAKER_06]: By the way, our chat room, have a good time laughing at that.

02:49:59.118 --> 02:50:10.302
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job, X. Uh, NintendoManiac64, F you, Loki, for stealing my line, which is because I can.

02:50:11.322 --> 02:50:16.064
[SPEAKER_06]: F you to my laptop, for not only having a cracked screen, but for the screen not even coming on now.

02:50:16.764 --> 02:50:21.425
[SPEAKER_06]: F you, Orange Lounge Radio talk show people, for having times that keep us east coasters up to 1230 AM.

02:50:21.445 --> 02:50:23.346
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah, sorry.

02:50:23.466 --> 02:50:25.647
[SPEAKER_06]: That's your own fucking fault for not living in the right time zone.

02:50:26.323 --> 02:50:33.327
[SPEAKER_06]: And plus, you know, we have to go to church before this show's on, so... F you to Homework for existing.

02:50:33.487 --> 02:50:34.487
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that that church with beer?

02:50:34.627 --> 02:50:34.887
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Knight says, my FU goes to bosses who ask people stupid questions when it comes to work, i.e., your credit app performance is bad, how do you look at yourself in the morning, type questions.

02:50:57.153 --> 02:51:05.336
[SPEAKER_06]: Ron Chan says, a massive giant FU to the catty bitches on the line that tried to get people kicked off the line and cried at Nintendo World to meet Miyamoto.

02:51:05.636 --> 02:51:06.657
[SPEAKER_06]: Please shut the fuck up.

02:51:06.997 --> 02:51:10.238
[SPEAKER_06]: If you tried to pull that, I would have grabbed you by your hair and chucked you into the street.

02:51:10.338 --> 02:51:11.579
[SPEAKER_06]: Welcome to New York, bitches.

02:51:13.610 --> 02:51:17.392
[SPEAKER_06]: Jaded's Angel says, F you to everyone for not posting comments in my live journal.

[SPEAKER_06]: Also, F you to forgetting my drama homework.

02:51:42.563 --> 02:51:44.064
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you have homework in drama?

02:51:44.885 --> 02:51:45.405
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Quebec.

02:51:46.286 --> 02:51:47.307

[SPEAKER_06]: You people are angsty as hell tonight.

[SPEAKER_06]: So, there it is.

[SPEAKER_06]: Your FUs of the week.

02:53:40.383 --> 02:53:42.204
[SPEAKER_06]: Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio.

02:53:42.825 --> 02:53:44.806
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, what's on your mind?

02:53:46.347 --> 02:53:47.828
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired of the cheese.

02:53:48.529 --> 02:53:50.610
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of want to eat the rest of it, but it's getting even harder.

02:53:52.391 --> 02:53:53.132
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's not much left.

02:53:53.312 --> 02:53:54.653
[SPEAKER_06]: You remember how much it came in with?

02:53:55.374 --> 02:53:56.274
[SPEAKER_06]: That is all that's left.

02:53:57.175 --> 02:53:58.776
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have the whole brick when you came in here?

02:53:59.281 --> 02:53:59.922
[SPEAKER_06]: I had half of it.

02:54:00.062 --> 02:54:02.124
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you worried about having a heart bypass when you're 30?

02:54:02.304 --> 02:54:02.404
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

02:54:02.985 --> 02:54:05.127
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just curious.

02:54:05.547 --> 02:54:06.448
[SPEAKER_22]: Are you 25 yet?

02:54:07.589 --> 02:54:07.869
[SPEAKER_22]: Yes.

02:54:08.670 --> 02:54:10.432
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, then you don't have to wait until 25 for that.

02:54:10.832 --> 02:54:11.393
[SPEAKER_06]: He just turned 25.

02:54:11.433 --> 02:54:12.654
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

02:54:13.194 --> 02:54:14.335
[SPEAKER_06]: His birthday is September 11th.

02:54:15.797 --> 02:54:16.297
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucky guy.

02:54:17.098 --> 02:54:19.100
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, well, damn, I'm out of topics.

02:54:19.480 --> 02:54:20.101
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me scan.

02:54:21.342 --> 02:54:23.584
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure I missed something here on OrangeLongerator.com.

02:54:23.804 --> 02:54:24.485
[SPEAKER_06]: Give me a moment here.

02:54:26.420 --> 02:54:26.921
[SPEAKER_06]: Ask Orange Lounge.

02:54:26.941 --> 02:54:27.882
[SPEAKER_06]: We've only got five minutes left.

02:54:28.502 --> 02:54:31.065
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, if we get a couple quick questions, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:54:31.465 --> 02:54:34.949
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurry up and send a question over to OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

02:54:35.369 --> 02:54:36.350
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I wanted to add this.

02:54:36.410 --> 02:54:37.712
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we can throw this out there.

02:54:37.752 --> 02:54:39.053
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a MySpace now.

02:54:39.393 --> 02:54:40.635
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess we can promote this, right?

02:54:40.735 --> 02:54:41.055
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

02:54:41.536 --> 02:54:42.897
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I was going to do it.

02:54:43.257 --> 02:54:44.959
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, Terry's going to turn it over to you, right?

02:54:45.300 --> 02:54:45.620
[SPEAKER_06]: Or something.

02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:46.541
[SPEAKER_06]: He said he would, so...

02:54:47.515 --> 02:55:00.303
[SPEAKER_06]: We are actually discontinuing, for those of you guys that are in our 1UP club, due to lack of activity and the fact that we're going to actually be leaving, or at least I'm going to be leaving my blog on 1UP.com for another project pretty soon.

02:55:00.884 --> 02:55:04.086
[SPEAKER_06]: No disrespect to the folks there, but we're going to discontinue our club there.

02:55:04.106 --> 02:55:04.986
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never used mine.

02:55:05.287 --> 02:55:07.488
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we're discontinuing our club at 1UP.com.

02:55:07.888 --> 02:55:09.669
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead, now we have a MySpace.

02:55:11.030 --> 02:55:15.053
[SPEAKER_06]: And MySpace, I know we've joked about sometimes, is where the internet goes to die.

02:55:15.073 --> 02:55:15.153
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

02:55:15.760 --> 02:55:18.521
[SPEAKER_06]: Your sister's Myspace Your sister's Myspace

02:55:37.540 --> 02:55:40.702
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually have a brand new club on Myspace.

02:55:40.742 --> 02:55:42.022
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to find the URL.

02:55:42.062 --> 02:55:46.544
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge, but I'm just kind of trying to make sure of that here.

02:55:49.486 --> 02:55:49.786
[SPEAKER_06]: Shoot.

02:55:50.386 --> 02:55:50.707
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go.

02:55:50.727 --> 02:55:55.569
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, it's groups.myspace.com slash Orange Lounge Radio.

02:55:55.589 --> 02:56:00.211
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're a Myspace whore, like the rest of us, you can actually join our club on Myspace.

02:56:00.591 --> 02:56:05.474
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know what we're going to do with the Myspace club, but we'll do clubby things.

02:56:07.560 --> 02:56:11.391
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll go and drink a lot and listen to Blur.

02:56:14.935 --> 02:56:15.956
[SPEAKER_22]: I like the baby seal clubs.

02:56:17.137 --> 02:56:19.319
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll club you, actually, if you join this club.

02:56:19.499 --> 02:56:19.939
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, cool.

02:56:19.979 --> 02:56:24.163
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe do a special giveaway for the club or something, but we want to have a MySpace page.

02:56:24.543 --> 02:56:32.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, something we thought about is maybe we actually should have an actual artist page so we can put songs on it, and it could be clips of the show or something.

02:56:32.610 --> 02:56:33.831
[SPEAKER_06]: So we thought about doing that, too.

02:56:33.911 --> 02:56:36.013
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe, DarkSakura, you can work on that one.

02:56:36.033 --> 02:56:36.313
[SPEAKER_06]: That's so cool.

02:56:36.373 --> 02:56:37.094
[SPEAKER_06]: Work on that end of it.

02:56:37.855 --> 02:56:38.155
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

02:56:38.415 --> 02:56:38.595
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe.

02:56:38.755 --> 02:56:41.458
[SPEAKER_06]: And, of course, I have my Loki Fusion page on MySpace.

02:56:42.492 --> 02:56:42.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, you do.

02:56:43.392 --> 02:56:44.733
[SPEAKER_06]: Hort that out because it's been a little while.

02:56:45.073 --> 02:56:46.753
[SPEAKER_06]: MySpace.com slash LokiFusion.

02:56:47.054 --> 02:56:49.714
[SPEAKER_06]: And I need to add some more stuff to it.

02:56:49.934 --> 02:56:50.935
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a couple songs on there.

02:56:51.875 --> 02:56:57.577
[SPEAKER_06]: But some stuff that you might not be able to find or, you know, because a lot of my MP3s are out there, but it's hard to find them now.

02:56:57.637 --> 02:56:59.578
[SPEAKER_06]: So they're up there, some of them.

02:57:00.918 --> 02:57:03.399
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we're actually getting some questions for Ask Orange Lounge.

02:57:03.439 --> 02:57:09.681
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have much time left in the show, so we're going to go ahead and get into these questions so we can wrap this shit up.

02:57:17.895 --> 02:57:20.796
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:57:21.296 --> 02:57:24.598
[SPEAKER_06]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:57:25.098 --> 02:57:31.961
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope if you had a question, you already sent it in because I'm cutting the rest of you off because we're going to be over time.

02:57:32.821 --> 02:57:33.222
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:57:35.663 --> 02:57:35.983
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini.

02:57:37.461 --> 02:57:37.941
[SPEAKER_06]: Strong Jaeger?

02:57:59.002 --> 02:58:06.569
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably ask somebody and probably find out, but I don't think that they'd appreciate me sharing that information right now.

02:58:08.551 --> 02:58:09.512
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was a Strong Yeager.

02:58:09.572 --> 02:58:10.813
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's something LED.

02:58:10.893 --> 02:58:11.774
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe it's like Big Voyager.

02:58:12.575 --> 02:58:12.855
[SPEAKER_06]: Could be.

02:58:16.018 --> 02:58:18.821
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett says he's heard Strong Yeager in there, definitely.

02:58:20.703 --> 02:58:23.125
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought you guys said Denton J was in there, and then I thought they were like...

02:58:23.823 --> 02:58:26.164
[SPEAKER_07]: mashing it all up with something else, but I thought I heard the bass from that in there.

02:58:26.364 --> 02:58:37.869
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought the two things that were in there were, because someone was saying there's five tracks, and it was 250 BPM, theme from Dungeon J, Love Me Do, Outer Limits, and then another remix of Love Me Do was my guess.

02:58:38.750 --> 02:58:39.830
[SPEAKER_06]: Not in exactly that order.

02:58:39.990 --> 02:58:40.310
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

02:58:40.991 --> 02:58:42.231
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll see.

02:58:43.272 --> 02:58:44.952
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, we've got to get to some other questions here.

02:58:45.333 --> 02:58:49.054
[SPEAKER_06]: Rini's second question, what would you do for a Klondike bar?

02:58:50.315 --> 02:58:50.515
[SPEAKER_06]: Eat it.

02:58:51.892 --> 02:58:53.717
[SPEAKER_06]: No, what would you do for a Klondike bar?

02:58:53.757 --> 02:58:55.362
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't eat it until you've done something for it.

02:58:55.442 --> 02:58:57.488
[SPEAKER_06]: I would eat another Klondike bar.

02:58:57.950 --> 02:58:59.293
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't eat a Klondike bar.

02:59:02.742 --> 02:59:03.062
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it!

02:59:03.122 --> 02:59:04.663
[SPEAKER_06]: I gotta go buy Klonic bars now!

02:59:04.743 --> 02:59:05.623
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you very much!

02:59:06.104 --> 02:59:08.745
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku says, I have an LCD TV now.

02:59:08.865 --> 02:59:10.385
[SPEAKER_06]: I need some cool shit to do with it.

02:59:11.146 --> 02:59:12.166
[SPEAKER_06]: Um... Kill it!

02:59:12.787 --> 02:59:13.807
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it to me!

02:59:13.967 --> 02:59:15.288
[SPEAKER_06]: Play it and put a spoiler on it.

02:59:15.368 --> 02:59:16.348
[SPEAKER_06]: Play Atari 2600 on it.

02:59:17.449 --> 02:59:22.351
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakurina says, what does the Poppin' Music whore think of the new Bomani logo on Poppin' 13?

02:59:24.012 --> 02:59:25.432
[SPEAKER_07]: Um, I have no idea really.

02:59:26.433 --> 02:59:26.753
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.

02:59:26.853 --> 02:59:28.774
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the interface looks like shit in Poppin' Music 13.

02:59:30.253 --> 02:59:34.615
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 says, Why do you like to deprive us Easterners of sleep?

02:59:35.855 --> 02:59:36.756
[SPEAKER_22]: That's your own fucking fault.

02:59:37.956 --> 02:59:42.538
[SPEAKER_22]: In all seriousness... Why do they like to deprive us of our morning here?

02:59:42.698 --> 02:59:52.202
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, if we did the show any earlier, we'd be cutting into the rest of our weekend, so we really can't... There's just... You're screwed, I'm sorry.

02:59:52.422 --> 02:59:56.723
[SPEAKER_06]: I really wish I had some better news for you, but... No, you're not screwed.

02:59:56.803 --> 02:59:57.744
[SPEAKER_06]: There's actually a way...

02:59:59.904 --> 03:00:02.765
[SPEAKER_06]: You can actually, they have like a thing for streaming media where it's like TiVo.

03:00:03.185 --> 03:00:04.186
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, TiVo this show.

03:00:04.286 --> 03:00:11.088
[SPEAKER_06]: Figure a way, I'm sure somebody like, somebody in our chat room that knows about those things, like John Fields comes to mind, I think he knows something about that.

03:00:12.569 --> 03:00:12.929
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rewinds.

03:00:12.949 --> 03:00:14.390
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably Misty has something like this too.

03:00:14.430 --> 03:00:15.210
[SPEAKER_06]: Rewinds are available.

03:00:15.930 --> 03:00:16.771
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure when they do them.

03:00:17.131 --> 03:00:17.751
[SPEAKER_06]: On Freak.

03:00:18.111 --> 03:00:19.151
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, on Fridays.

03:00:21.132 --> 03:00:25.834
[SPEAKER_06]: NintendoManiac64 also wants to know, why doesn't my Pneuma MP3 work in WMP?

03:00:26.494 --> 03:00:28.435
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't want to play that song because it's Horde.

03:00:36.909 --> 03:00:43.655
[SPEAKER_06]: John Field says, given your recent issues with show timing, are there any considerations of expanding the show another half an hour to an hour?

03:00:45.097 --> 03:00:47.599
[SPEAKER_10]: Only if you'd like to wake up and do my job for me in the morning.

03:00:48.360 --> 03:00:51.163
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if that's...

03:00:52.382 --> 03:00:57.425
[SPEAKER_06]: He might be talking about Orange Lounge To Go, because Orange Lounge To Go is supposed to be 30 minutes, but it's been going an hour.

03:00:58.306 --> 03:01:01.028
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge To Go goes however long we feel like, basically.

03:01:01.928 --> 03:01:02.689
[SPEAKER_10]: But this one, no.

03:01:02.949 --> 03:01:03.229
[SPEAKER_10]: No way.

03:01:03.930 --> 03:01:08.693
[SPEAKER_06]: This particular show, no, because we taped the podcast right after this show, so there's no way we could expand the show.

03:01:08.733 --> 03:01:12.035
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, if anything, we'd want to cut back this show to make our podcast longer.

03:01:13.756 --> 03:01:15.757
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're not going to do that anytime soon.

03:01:16.297 --> 03:01:17.158
[SPEAKER_06]: No plans at this time.

03:01:19.889 --> 03:01:23.172
[SPEAKER_06]: Tomokun says, Blu-ray or HD DVD?

03:01:23.712 --> 03:01:29.016
[SPEAKER_06]: I want them both to come up with something that's standard so both work because I don't want to buy two players, period.

03:01:30.136 --> 03:01:30.497
[SPEAKER_06]: That's it.

03:01:32.038 --> 03:01:33.239
[SPEAKER_06]: Toshiba's making one of both.

03:01:33.499 --> 03:01:33.739
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

03:01:35.300 --> 03:01:38.282
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Illusion wants to ask, where's Waldo?

03:01:39.963 --> 03:01:40.423
[SPEAKER_06]: In Quebec.

03:01:43.486 --> 03:01:44.586
[SPEAKER_06]: Having sex with Extover?

03:01:44.666 --> 03:01:45.007
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

03:01:45.847 --> 03:01:47.068
[SPEAKER_06]: Hiding in a bunker in Iraq.

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:51.939
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the end of the show, boys and girls.

03:01:52.859 --> 03:01:53.799
[SPEAKER_06]: Final thought time.

03:01:54.600 --> 03:01:55.820
[SPEAKER_06]: Extifer, your final thought.

03:01:57.341 --> 03:01:58.441
[SPEAKER_06]: Why's it gotta be me?

03:01:59.281 --> 03:02:00.401
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, your final thought.

03:02:01.922 --> 03:02:02.382
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett?

03:02:03.282 --> 03:02:04.363
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't have a final thought.

03:02:04.403 --> 03:02:05.083
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm thoughtless.

03:02:05.503 --> 03:02:06.083
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for coming.

03:02:06.603 --> 03:02:07.124
[SPEAKER_06]: You're welcome.

03:02:07.864 --> 03:02:09.624
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not what he said.

03:02:10.545 --> 03:02:11.865
[SPEAKER_22]: He didn't say thanks for coming.

03:02:13.125 --> 03:02:14.146
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugged, your final thought.

03:02:14.926 --> 03:02:15.666
[SPEAKER_22]: Because it's Quebec.

03:02:16.987 --> 03:02:17.867
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, your final thought.

03:02:18.291 --> 03:02:24.074
[SPEAKER_06]: I forgot to mention this earlier, but fuck you to McDonald's for making shoddy cups that break open in my car.

03:02:24.534 --> 03:02:24.995
[SPEAKER_06]: Every time.

03:02:27.036 --> 03:02:31.438
[SPEAKER_06]: And my final thought is, um, I still don't want to clean.

03:02:32.298 --> 03:02:33.399
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

03:02:34.580 --> 03:02:36.741
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, I want pancakes.

03:02:38.221 --> 03:02:39.202
[SPEAKER_10]: And reject false icons.

03:02:39.782 --> 03:02:41.003
[SPEAKER_10]: We need to go to Country Waffles.

03:02:42.185 --> 03:02:43.226
[SPEAKER_06]: I had country waffles today.

03:02:43.246 --> 03:02:45.127
[SPEAKER_10]: I have to have pancakes on a cheat day.

03:02:45.428 --> 03:02:46.709
[SPEAKER_06]: I went to country waffles today.

03:02:47.009 --> 03:02:47.429
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate you.

03:02:47.869 --> 03:02:48.310
[SPEAKER_06]: I love waffles.

03:02:48.330 --> 03:02:49.771
[SPEAKER_06]: I want a peanut butter banana waffle so bad.

03:02:49.831 --> 03:02:51.552
[SPEAKER_10]: I can have cheat day next month.

03:02:51.752 --> 03:02:51.993
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:02:54.354 --> 03:02:57.177
[SPEAKER_06]: Final word, one word of the show to sum it all up.

03:02:57.217 --> 03:03:02.621
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't forget, kids, send in your haikus to win our copy of In the Groove, 573 style.

03:03:03.502 --> 03:03:07.465
[SPEAKER_06]: Garrett, the poppin' music whore, gets one word to sum up the whole show, the final word of the night.

03:03:08.966 --> 03:03:09.126
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

03:03:10.504 --> 03:03:15.349

[SPEAKER_01]: If your father was alive, I don't know what he'd say.

03:05:10.443 --> 03:05:11.744
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to Mrs. Corelli yesterday.

03:05:11.764 --> 03:05:13.105
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Bobby Corelli was in your grade.

03:05:13.165 --> 03:05:14.546
[SPEAKER_01]: He got promoted again at his law firm.

03:05:14.586 --> 03:05:16.407
[SPEAKER_01]: He's making $175,000 a year now.

03:05:16.487 --> 03:05:17.688
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on drugs?

03:05:17.728 --> 03:05:18.849
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you ever call me back?

03:05:18.869 --> 03:05:20.330
[SPEAKER_01]: When are you going to get married, son?

03:05:20.370 --> 03:05:27.154
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it about time you settled down and got yourself a wife and got yourself a house and got a kid and got a car and got a dog and got a lawnmower and got a nice picket fence?

03:05:31.577 --> 03:05:40.024

03:06:08.019 --> 03:06:12.622
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't somebody just send her a check and shut her and those goddamn kids off?

03:06:12.642 --> 03:06:14.303
Where's Rob Reiner when you need him?

03:06:14.324 --> 03:06:14.444
Why?

03:06:14.464 --> 03:06:15.424

[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:07:40.492 --> 03:07:44.274
[SPEAKER_06]: Chatroom is incessantly asking where they can download the V-Remix.

03:07:44.374 --> 03:07:45.494
[SPEAKER_06]: Can they download that anywhere?

03:07:45.534 --> 03:07:48.036
[SPEAKER_06]: Do they have to buy the diverse thing?

03:07:50.137 --> 03:07:53.078
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if Alt-Ctrl-Delete was still up.

03:07:53.978 --> 03:07:58.621
[SPEAKER_06]: They're having bandwidth issues right now, but it would be if there was a torrent on Alt-Ctrl-Delete.com.

03:07:58.641 --> 03:08:00.722
[SPEAKER_06]: They have a whole diverse systems folder.

03:08:01.162 --> 03:08:02.683
[SPEAKER_06]: But that would be where you'd find it.

03:08:04.223 --> 03:08:05.984
[SPEAKER_06]: But until they come back, no.

03:08:06.424 --> 03:08:06.745
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

03:08:07.445 --> 03:08:07.685
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

03:08:08.483 --> 03:08:09.744
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for tuning in and listening.

03:08:09.804 --> 03:08:12.326
[SPEAKER_06]: We're now going to go back to our Bomani Music and More program.

03:08:13.027 --> 03:08:14.088
