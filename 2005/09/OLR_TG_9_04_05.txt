Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 5th, 2005.
You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion and news and all that stuff.
on video games that don't suck, but sometimes we have to talk about video games that do suck, just to tell you to avoid them, and I know I plan to do that tonight.
With me, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, back from a brief absence.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I'm married.
You are married, congratulations.
Thank you, I'm actually in the middle of my honeymoon, but I decided to take some time out and say hi.
Now that's some dedication.
I got me some bling.
Congratulations.
It's platinum and gold and expensive.
I think we're going to put a picture of the ring on the website for those people who were asking.
Yeah, but don't put one of me on there.
Oh, I know.
Your face remains a mystery.
Although if they look very carefully at the album art, there's a little picture of DarkSakura in the corner.
Yeah, and it's like an overhead shot because I was holding my phone up that way.
It's an artsy shot.
It's an artsy shot.
It's because I was taking a picture of myself with my phone because I'm so vain.
Also say hello to the one and only Loki.
Hi.
By the way, we're on our fourth take tonight because we got a case of the giggles, but we're trying to get through it this time.
I had a case of the Guinness.
That would happen being that we are having a little bit of alcohol because there is a holiday weekend.
Yes, it's Labor Day weekend, so we were doing a little bit of drinking for our live show tonight, except...
Thanks to Technical Difficulties Live 365, our live show didn't happen, so we've just been enjoying some drinks.
Yeah, technically they suck.
Yeah, well, the ferret has something to say about that.
Oh, what's that?
Thank you.
We have a podcast guest tonight.
We don't allow guests on the show very often, so this guest is very, very extra special.
First rule of podcasts is do not talk about podcasts.
Say hello to Mel B is here tonight.
Greetings, everybody, from the only sober one in this room so far.
How you doing, Mel?
I'm doing pretty good, actually.
For those that may not know you, why are you an internet celebrity?
We're going to make all our podcast guests say this now.
Why are you an internet celebrity?
Wow, I guess it happened, oh, about five years ago when someone clicked on a link on a DDR site and saw a video of me dancing, and, like, this is back when Dance Dance Revolution had a freestyle and people were in the community and doing fun things and trying new things, and...
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
XBOX Ver.
Both in Ultramix and Ultramix 2 Did some stuff for Extreme and among other things Very cool, and any other game companies that you've had experience with?
I had a cup of coffee with Namco for a couple months And that's really about it Right now I'm not working in the game industry But I'd definitely like to be back later So for a lot of our podcast listeners out there who listen to this They live all over the world What's it like to work on the inside, working for the game company?
It's kind of like almost any other job that, you know, you kind of always dream about working.
You know, it's like anytime you hear a video game test and you think, wow, I get to play with games all day long.
That must be the most kickback job.
And to the most extent, yes, it is a pretty kickback job.
You know, it's like you get paid to do something you do pretty much, you know, something that you do at home sitting on your ass getting paid nothing, you know.
But it's, as with any job, there are positives and negatives.
Negatives is, man, if you're like, say, a big fan of one game,
Playing it 40 hours a week for 8 weeks straight, you're going to learn to not like it as much.
So you get a little burned out on DDR after playing it so much.
Yeah, you do.
There's just whole other types of things, especially when you work in quality assurance.
But with any other job, QA is sort of like you're the grunt of the company.
A lot of people go into that thinking, oh, I can become a developer of it or a producer.
And in some cases, you can.
It just depends on the company.
I mean, if it's a really huge company, it's like you're one of like
250, 300 people that are trying to jump ahead and make that next step.
But if you're in a smaller company, chances are you do have a shot at making it.
So I'm not by no means discouraging anyone from doing anything.
I mean, just do what you like.
And I like doing what I did.
I have no regrets.
And like I said, I'd like to be back sometime.
All right, very cool.
Any quick advice for somebody that wants to get their foot in the door in the game industry?
It's really not that hard to get into testing, really.
Essentially, you just go onto corporate websites.
If you have a gaming company around in your area, especially whether you're in the Bay Area of California or you're in Southern California or Florida or some places, just check out the corporate sites.
Just get into testing.
I mean...
When you're going to the job interview, just let them know, especially on your resume and stuff.
List down every single console that you've played.
Talk about the types of games you are interested in.
Talk about games that you mastered.
Because people like to know, wow, there's probably some hidden things that you found out that we thought no one else would.
and then you do you just learn basically that being a tester isn't just playing games it's you're trying to break the game more than anything so you have to do all sorts of crazy stuff like if you're playing a racing game you have to try driving backwards and see if you could crash the game because that's what you're paid to do you're paid to break the game
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Yeah, as in from XL Saga.
Who seems like a fairly well-behaved doggy so far.
As far as other games, they're ones I can't really talk about on air, so I'm going to leave those alone.
Oh yeah, and we are probably within the next couple weeks going to be starting up on World of Warcraft.
Oh boy, okay.
Well, we need somebody from this show to be in there to give us updates, so...
Yep.
I'm going to play an undead rogue or a priest.
Undead priest, undead rogue.
Or I'm going to be playing a night elf hunter on another server.
Haven't made a decision yet, huh?
I hear that their expansion that they're doing for World of Warcraft, it's free.
Oh, interesting.
Downloadable.
Because they figured that the users, they're giving them a little kickback because they paid enough.
Wow.
Square Enix needs a hint here.
And also, though, with your first month of World of Warcraft, you do pay nothing.
Well, yeah, a lot of MMOs do that, though.
Ragnarok doesn't, bastards.
F Ragnarok.
So, huh?
They give you the first one free because, you know, it's like any other drug dealer, man.
They give you that first hit for, you know, a discount price.
Then you got to come back.
Then they know there's demand.
Then, you know, they got you.
That's right.
It's like get you hooked on, you know, get your first dose of heroin's free.
The puppies!
The puppies!
My dog is retarded.
I'm...
I gave him the lay down command, sounds too much like sit down.
So when I tell him to sit down, he lays down.
Although I renamed the rollover to play dead.
So he sticks his legs in the air, his little stub legs.
He is excellent when it comes to the frisbee though.
He makes me lots of money.
So would you recommend the game to somebody else?
Yes.
Why?
Because of the bees.
The cuteness factor.
You have to feed your puppies.
You have to bathe your puppies, and you have to pet your puppies, and you have to take them for a walk.
And remember to clean up their crap!
Is Nintendogs as annoying as the Tamagotchi?
Tamagotchi was really stupid.
I have a Digimon still.
I have an old school Digimon.
Why is Nintendogs not stupid?
Because they don't look like little digital blips on the screen.
Your puppy likes you too, and he jumps, and he plays bone, he plays frisbee, and he throws frisbee, like, well shit, you just threw it away, why should I, okay here.
So they got a lot of personality.
He's a puppy.
Alright.
Loki, what have you been playing this week?
I like throwing the bark ball at my Nintendog because it's afraid of it.
It reminds me so much of my mom's dog because my mom's Chihuahua is afraid of everything.
I hit my puppy in the head the first time with the bark ball.
And I went like that.
I've been playing a lot, a lot of stuff because we actually have 19 game publishers come out to my work for some little conference thing.
So it was like E3 coming to me.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Classic games, if I'm really bored, maybe, but I'm not too big a fan of that.
I did like, however, you did the PSP game send for me.
Game sharing.
Okay, game sharing.
You did the game sharing feature for me so I could play the little demos.
I was a little disappointed that they were only first round demos, but there were a heck of a lot of demos on there.
You know, Dig Dug, Rally X. Now, granted, it's the same game from the 80s, but still...
to be able for you to send those to me for free was kind of neat.
You know, there was a lot of games on there, and they did also, they have these arrangement games, four different arrangement games, which are kind of updated graphics.
It's almost like the game is remade, which was really cool.
Those are really cool.
And Rally-X Arrangement, that's the only place you can play Rally-X Arrangement.
That's one of my favorite arrangement games they ever did.
Yeah, and I think that they're actually, they have the Rally-X and they have New Rally-X, which I think New Rally-X is the one that was on the Ridge Racer series.
New RallyX is there.
There's really no difference.
RallyX arrangements work.
But yeah, okay, so anyways, it was really cool.
And then I also, I have DeathJr, but I haven't gotten to play it yet.
Looks cool, just, you know, hopefully this time I can hear the sound, unlike E3.
Um...
DarkSakura.com
What's great about it is you can actually do the crash breaker where you make your car explode.
Every Time I Crash.
I love that.
That's fucking awesome.
And plus there's jumps and it's a lot faster, so it's really cool.
Then on top of that, I played actually with my DS a little bit because I got some more games.
I got Pack and Roll, which was really interesting.
I love Pack and Roll.
It's not really my thing, but it's a lot better than Pack Picks, that's for sure, because that game kind of sucked.
Pack Picks was awesome!
Anyways, so then I also played the DS version of Star Wars Episode 3, and that was actually pretty cool.
It looked like a really good Super Nintendo game.
That's what it reminded me of.
What's the DS feature in that game?
What's the dual screen?
In some of the stuff, it's just the status screen.
In other ones, you can use it for the flight sim parts and stuff like that.
It's mainly they don't really use the touchscreen stuff that much, but...
That's fine.
I've said this on a previous episode.
You don't have to whore the touch thing in every game.
The dual screen thing is fine.
I mean, make use of that.
Some other things I was going to mention, though.
At the conferencing, they were talking about the game coming out from Konami, Lost in Blue.
They're doing a lot of things with the DS that fucking rock.
For example, there's one part where you have to make fire.
You take the stylus and you rub it between your hands like it's a stick.
And like you're rubbing sticks together to make fire.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Seeing Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfire, Tom Clancy's new game Fucking looks sexy I don't even like first person shooters, but oh my god does that look sexy What was that insider info you were telling me about 360 before the show?
Oh, 360, a few things They're only shipping 700,000 to 1 million units at launch So, you know, that's why you get those pre-orders You heard it here first Yeah, I mean, that's not really known
and for backwards compatibility, you have to have the hard drive.
No hard drive, no playing the old games.
Interesting.
I have not read that anywhere.
Interesting.
They've got some information out there.
Also, it's only going to support a few games at launch and they're going to be adding more every two weeks.
Why do you have to have the hard drive for backwards compatibility?
I don't know.
Oh, because the emulator is going to be on the drive, right?
Is that what it is?
Something like that.
Mel thinks he knows.
What's going on?
Well, essentially, the way they have to reverse, you know, play backwards compatibility is they have to have software for it.
And their thing is they haven't officially finished it out yet.
So the thing is you're going to have to have the hard drive available.
So when it's ready, then, you know, you can download it or whatever.
I'm not sure how it works.
Interesting.
Yeah, because it's not basically the backwards thing hasn't been finished yet.
Hmm.
If you think about the Xbox Live Silver that they're talking about, you're like, oh, I can play some online games.
Nope.
Think again.
You've got to buy the Xbox Live.
I'm going to get to a story about that in a little bit.
Okay, so we've got that.
There's another thing that they're adding with Xbox Live that's really cool, Spectator Mode.
So, for example, they're doing the Madden Challenge with the new next-gen Madden game.
You can go in, watch the game, watch them as a spectator, watch people play.
You can have racing games, everything.
So that's a new thing that they have, Spectator Mode on that.
and the webcam sounds good as far as my gaming week I haven't played a whole lot of new games I did go out and do some impulse buys the other day I was at Fry's which is like this huge electronics store here that sells a lot of games and they have a lot of cheap games so I was looking through their $20 games I picked up Namco 50th Anniversary Collection because it was only $15 and the Namco 50th Anniversary Collection has like 14 old Namco games in it Pac-Man, Ms.
Pac-Man and this is the one where I was talking about a few weeks on the show has licensed music in it
Like it has Dexys Midnight Runners, Come On Eileen.
It has She Drives Me Crazy, like all those songs.
Okay, Namco 50th Anniversary Collection sucks.
I do not recommend this game.
I'm sorry to say, I love Namco.
This collection sucks balls.
And the reason why...
They've done this before, many times, on PlayStation 1 and current gen.
They've already done this.
Granted, there's a couple of new games here.
There's one on the PSP.
King and the Balloon
Granted, I will give Namco credit because they didn't advertise this on the box that it had 80s music, but you don't have it during the actual game.
The only time you hear this is in the menu.
That's it.
So when you go into the actual game...
There's no music.
Nothing.
Yeah, it actually did the same thing for the Activision Collection, because there was cool 80s music in the menu screens, but when you play, it's still blip.
That's boring to me.
There wasn't really... The arranged games were not nowhere to be seen.
There were a couple unlocks.
I just think there's so much more that could have been done with this.
Midway Collections.
Great stuff.
Online ranking boards.
Xbox Live Aware.
Um...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
If you do not own any of these previous Namco collections, I suppose this is a place to start because these are some important games that are good and you should have in your collection.
But honestly, I don't recommend this game.
Even if you're a fan of classic gaming, get the other Namco collections.
They're better.
This one is not good.
by the Namco Battle Collection.
Absolutely.
Now, the Namco Battle Collection is cool.
It's got the arranged versions in it.
It's got the game beaming.
Multiplayer.
I think it works better on a handheld than it does on a console.
If you are interested in this, go get the PSP version.
Do not buy the Xbox.
The other thing, too, is if the monitors were vertical or whatever, you can adjust the orientation so that the monitors are taller and stuff on there.
It's just really awesome.
Cool.
I did actually play other Konami games this weekend.
What's that?
Well, Dan and I went to the casino.
I played Slot Machine.
Oh, okay.
So you played Slot Machine.
Hey, he lost a dollar and I made 12.
What else did I play?
I bought .hack part one because all of a sudden I'm like, even though there's four parts, I'm like, I want to get into the .hack games again because I played them a little bit.
And they're faux MMOs where the plot is that it's an MMORPG, but it's not really an MMORPG.
You should watch the anime.
Rob, what?
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I have Nedcons and Jogcons and Erskinecons.
We have lots of listeners.
Send me free games.
I'm glad you mentioned that.
We do have game companies that will be listening to us thanks to me.
Because I have a lot of press kits.
Hi, game companies!
Hi!
Apparently EA does listen to... There's one guy at EA that listens to gaming podcasts.
Not us.
Which made me sad.
Was it because we kind of talk shit about Madden?
No.
We don't talk shit about Madden.
I just don't like Madden.
I like Burnout.
I talk much about Burnout, okay?
Anyways.
I seem to remember reviewing Battlefield 2 and my review was something along the lines of, what's the big idea?
DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
Um, played a lot of Quackshot on Genesis, actually.
What made you decide to go to Genesis?
Um, well, actually, it was the Classic Gaming Expo about two weeks ago, and so I checked it out, and you know, always going into retro stuff, and just, um, because my girlfriend had just pulled out her, um, CDX, actually, because she was into Sega CD at the time when we were just trying to basically get all our old gaming systems up on the TV going, and
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
At the time, my 16-bit was a huge deal back then, you know?
Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.
I remember.
Did you see the guy that was making the portable systems, the custom portable systems at Classic GameX?
Oh, yes.
He's supposed to be there.
Yes.
I did see him.
He's doing Dreamcast portable systems now.
Oh, very cool.
Very cool.
All right.
Anything else?
See, besides that, I was playing a lot of old EA sports, which are called Lakers vs. Celtics, Madden 93 back then.
But as far as more current games, I actually was...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DanSummit2001
Alright, that was just a huge step back for Enix at the time.
Goodness, because it was like, I don't know why they ruined a franchise like that.
Because the first two games were awesome.
You had personalities, you had characters people got attached to.
The music was great.
The first one had great novelty type songs that would fit a video game.
But the second one, they did some really great production.
They had guys from like... AVEX?
Yeah, AVEX, Earth, Wind & Fire.
Maurice White, he did Hero Kun's theme.
So it was like...
This was something you could actually legitimately hear as mainstream pop radio, and then the third one totally took a step backwards, and everything you knew about the game and loved about the game was gone.
You know, I think Square and Enix, now that they've merged, they should do a...
They should do, like, a Final Fantasy dancing game with the bus.
No, I'm kidding.
It would be horrible.
Hey, I actually liked Dance Summit.
Really?
Honestly enough.
But, you know, I was... Marty Swite also did anime stuff, too.
He did the Gatchaman anime, so I was like, the second one's my favorite of the bunch.
But I did really like the third one.
It had a very innovative idea and a special controller.
It made me think of the old ColecoVision joystick one with the little four buttons on it.
DarkSakura
Here's your advice column.
What are you going to tell the kids about tonight?
If you're on your honeymoon, don't go do your podcast because you never know when you're going to leave.
No.
Today's bit of advice is how to survive in a plummeting elevator.
Elevators have numerous safety features.
There have been very few recorded incidents involving death from plummeting elevators.
In general, it is highly unlikely for a cable, also called traction elevator, to fall all the way to the bottom of the shaft.
I said chapped.
Moreover, the compressed air column in the elevator hoistway and the car buffers at the bottom of the hoistway may keep the forces of the impact survivable.
Number one, flatten your body against the car floor.
This should distribute the force of the impact rather than concentrate it on one area of your body.
Standing may be difficult anyway.
I would have never thought of that.
Number two, cover your face and head to prevent them from sealing parts that may break loose.
But my final piece of advice... Take the stairs, fat ass.
Take the fucking stairs!
And on that note, I will go ahead and give my final word of the show.
Yes, honey.
Which is reject false icons and don't chug Guinness.
Alright.
Thank you, DarkSakura, for being here and have a good one.
Congratulations once again on getting hitched.
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
Started off with the Xbox 360, Xbox Live 2.0.
The details are out.
And yes, if you have a silver subscription to Xbox Live, you will be able to download game trailers, demos of upcoming games, episode style content, and you can create a profile, leave voice messages for other live Xbox gamers.
The one thing you won't be able to do, however, is play games head-to-head.
Sorry, you will have to have a gold membership in order to do that.
Gold Membership, $7.99 a month for a one-month subscription card, but they do have other ideas as well.
$19.99 for a three-month option, and let's see, I believe it's $49.99 for a 12-month subscription card.
You want the kit that comes with the headset and all that stuff, it's approximately $20 more depending on what you get.
They're saying that there's a headset pack, it's a three-month set, $10 rebate card on the game,
and Joust from Xbox Live Arcade, $39.99.
Joust?
Joust.
Woohoo!
Joust!
Hey, Joust was a rad game.
Yeah, like in the 80s.
Seriously.
You know, you run around with lances and you steal people's egos, you know?
Lego my ego.
That was Joust.
Oh, God.
So, those of you guys that were hoping that the silver subscription would allow you to play some games, sorry.
Sorry.
Exactly.
That whole core system is a joke anyways.
I mean, it's like, yeah, here's this Xbox.
It looks pretty, but you can't do anything with it until you buy the rest.
If you're listening to this show, you're a hardcore enough gamer where if you're going to be buying a 360, you really need to consider the higher end.
And I'm not saying that as somebody who works for Microsoft, because I don't, but...
Just do the math.
If you think that later on you might be interested in any of this stuff, such as the hard drive, you're going to end up paying more in the long run if you buy just the core system and then all this stuff separately.
So you really need to think about this.
Hey, folks, listen.
The hard drive, just a laptop drive anyways.
Think about it, folks.
Buy the hard drive.
Upgrade it for free.
or get the converter, you know I'm going to be hooking up some 300 gig hard drive to that thing.
You know that's going to happen.
It's a matter of time.
The only thing, they didn't actually show it as part of the show.
and Dance Dance Revolution was there to comment and their comment was Suck it, Halo 2!
Wow.
Blizzard won a pretty important hacking lawsuit this week.
I think this is kind of interesting.
There was an appeals court, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
Louis, and they ruled this week that federal law, specifically the DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, disallows players from altering Blizzard games to link with servers other than the company's official Battle.net site.
So there were defendants in this case, Ross Combs, Rob Favreau,
Critterden.
They reverse engineered Blizzard's protocol using some tools such as TCP dump and they had this project going on, the BnetD, that would allow your Blizzard games to connect with unofficial servers.
And of course you get faster response times and all sorts of things that come along with using unofficial servers.
However, Blizzard layeth the smack down for them reverse engineering the program, so to speak.
So
What I find is interesting is I know a lot of people that have sort of done something similar with Xbox Live.
Now, I'm not too familiar on the exacts of how they hack, so it's probably a different process, but I think it's interesting that this kind of sets a precedent in a way.
Well, this is just dumb.
I think this is about StarCraft, if I remember correctly, and it was just servers that they're playing on.
I mean, it's not like that you actually have to pay for it.
It's free.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Quarter of a million units sold already.
In the first week.
In the first week.
That's about 15% of the amount of people that own a DS, which for, you know, a game in the first week of release is pretty damn good.
A game that came out the same day, Advance Wars Dual Strike, also selling pretty well.
So don't assume that Nintendogs is the only must-own DS game right now.
Advance Wars, doing pretty well.
I haven't had a chance to check out that game myself, but I've heard good things about it, so...
Battalion Wars coming out soon too.
That's Advanced Wars for the GameCube.
They will be doing a PlayStation Spot.
It's like a booth where the PSP owners will be able to download demos of upcoming games from this spot.
Hmm, where have I heard this before?
Oh yes, Nintendo's DS download booth at E3.
And how did that work?
Oh yeah, that's right, not very well.
BaitoHell2000 and PortableResort
I haven't heard of those last two.
Portable Resorts, Namco, and this weird Rengoku 2.
I'm surprised they're even making a sequel to that.
The first one kind of sucked.
Well, check it out.
It's going to be downloadable.
And then Rockman Legends.
It's pretty cool, actually.
I played a little bit of it.
Yeah, how was that?
This is the direct port of the PlayStation game.
That's all it is.
It's just direct port.
Looks cool.
I'm excited about it.
I wish they'd release more sequels, but you know.
Loki got a couple of hack and crack stories for us tonight.
Yes, yes, I do.
The first on the list is the We Are Back group, the ones behind several of the launchers and the whole exploit to actually play Homebrew stuff.
They've released a program to actually fake update your system.
So in other words, for example, on my system, which was a 1.5, because I have two, but...
I upgraded mine to a fake 152, which will allow me to play Namco Museum Collection, which wants to upgrade your system if you don't.
And it won't play unless you upgrade your system.
But, because it tricks it, now you can play it.
And you can do this through, you know, just version 1 all the way to 2.
What's also interesting is actually they're working on it right now because they want to be perfect on it.
They have a way to revert those systems that actually are 1.5.2 and 1.5.1 to revert them back to 1.5.
So they play homebrew stuff.
So if you haven't upgraded yours to 2.0 yet and you're not 1.5, why don't they just work on getting the homebrew stuff to work with 2.0?
Because I kind of want 2.0 features.
They have 2.0.
They changed all their encryption the way they do it.
So it's a little tougher, but pretty soon it's not going to matter.
So they can revert those 1.5, 2.1s back to 1.5.
Next step is 2.0s to 1.5.
It's a matter of time.
We'll see.
But that's what they've got going on right now.
Other than that, just the same homebrew stuff, made a Minesweeper game.
It's kind of cool, but yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on.
All right.
Uh, let's get to some housekeeping stuff.
Let's start it off with a mailbag, shall we?
Of course, if you want to send us an email, you can always drop us a line.
It's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com to send us an email.
We got just two emails this week.
I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on emails tonight, because we've spent enough time talking about stuff.
But, we did get a couple good emails, and we want to read this.
Certainly, this one is a difference of opinion type issue.
This one comes to us from Ed M.,

It says, I really enjoy the shows and congrats on the pod show awards.
Actually, I don't think, did we win something for pod show?
I don't think that was that.
I think it's podcast.
Yeah, it's the podcast award.
If we did win something for pod show, that's news to me.
Hey, cool.
No, I think pod show is Adam Curry's side.
I get lost in all that podcasting.
You know, I'm just here to talk about games.
If we win a couple awards for it, cool.
But no, that's alright.
We know it gets confusing.
Here's the real part of the letter we want to read.
You guys really need to lay off parents and how they raise their children.
I am a parent with two adolescent boys who is also a gamer and have been since I was in junior high.
You guys, on the other hand, are not parents and really have no clue about it.
Yet you profess to have it all worked out.
Allow me to be the first to tell you that you forget about it.
Everything you think will change.
I think there was a little grammar there, but that's alright.
You get what she's saying there.
Um...
Even if I have read and signed your proposed disclaimer, it still would not have protected my children from the Easter egg in San Andreas had I purchased that for my sons.
In your infinite wisdom, you have not addressed how to protect the consumers from the game developers that you continue to defend that lie their asses off.
Rockstar lied about the hows and whys of that particular programming gem.
The game developers have every right to put into their games whatever they want, but if I ask, I also have the right to be told the truth.
They share in the responsibility.
Let me finish this mail, then we'll respond here.
Games, reviews, news, and like is your shtick.
Trying to explain to people how to be parents is not.
Stick to what you know and leave parenting to the parents in the audience.
Burn.
DarkSakura
Let me start.
So he does say that Rockstar lied about the hows and why of the particular programming gem.
Of course, the hot coffee mod going back a couple months ago to that news there.
I do think that there was, and I said this a couple months ago when this story first came out.
I do think when Rockstar put this game out, they never intended that mod to be seen.
I do think they put it in the game on purpose, but somewhere in the testing process, they intended to take it out.
As I've mentioned on a previous show, I think a pointer, of course, if you design a game, you have a flowchart, right?
Basically a ginormous flowchart that works your way through the game.
Whatever led from the game to the hot coffee part, that pointer was taken out.
So in Rockstar's eyes, there was no possible way.
There was no up, up, down, down, left, right code that was going to let you access that.
It was out of the game.
A very similar parallel would be Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
No, there's no hot coffee mod in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, but there is a song, Memories is the song, Konami took this song out of the game at the last minute.
Why?
I don't know.
But instead of taking the song out, all the data's on the disc.
but some hackers found out that if you turn a certain hexamodestal point on or whatever, hack your card data, you can access the song.
It's like you're putting the pointer back in on the flowchart.
That's what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
I'm almost positive this is what happened is that that pointer that was intended to get taken out got put back in.
And of course with a huge company like Rockstar you probably have the programmers that knew that was in there but they had thought they had taken it out and didn't realize that some kid was going to
figure out how to put it back in so whose fault is this in this case I don't know but here's what I do know
programmers will be taking the extra effort from now on instead of simply taking a pointer out they're going to go back and recompile all the data and these games will be pushed back a couple of months while they rebuild the code from the ground up to ensure that this crap is no longer in the games when it's not intended to be because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has set the bar at that now that you can no longer leave this stuff that you do not want accessed on the disc because people will find it and they will play it
and as you can see what happened here.
Now, in regards to the portion of the email that talks about the person being a parent with kids and also being a gamer, I'm going to guess if you're a gamer, you know what is and isn't appropriate for your kids.
so when we go off on parents or what have you please don't assume you sir are part of these people unfortunately there are many many out there educated parents and you're right I may not be a parent myself but I see it I see these parents that are going into the stores and they're letting their kids boss them around and the kids are the ones picking up the game and
They don't seem to be... The parents that are buying the game are absolutely clueless.
This is stuff that's in there.
I have watched a kid pick up Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and the parent just goes, is that something you should be playing?
And the kid goes, yeah, it's fine.
And the parent goes, okay, son.
And it's just kind of like...
I don't have to be a parent to recognize there's something not right there.
If it was a movie, if the movie was rated R, the parent wanted to know why it's rated R. And certainly I envision that one day I may have children and I have ideas on how to raise them.
So do I necessarily have kids myself and have these first person experiences?
No.
And am I going to be the perfect parent?
No.
Because some other freaking, probably if I do have kids...
A friend could always expose my kid to the games I don't want him to see.
And that's just something we've got to deal with.
And I say that we talk to our kids about what is and isn't appropriate in games because just like you would talk to them about sex and R-rated things, talk to them about it, drugs, all that stuff.
And that's the best way is to be a part of your kid's life.
And I don't think I have to be a parent to necessarily know that, I hope.
I don't know, that's just my fuse.
Loki?
Thank you for watching!
You know what?
You made the decision.
It may have been a bad decision, but you've got to live with it.
That's basically what it is.
Really, the people we're talking to are like dumb grandma who doesn't know anything, and she is suing Rockstar because little Billy saw some polygon boob.
Well, you know what?
Little Billy shouldn't have been playing the game, and grandma should have listened to the stupid little thing that's on every single game, the ratings that are on there.
That's why they put them on there.
They don't put it on there just for the hell of it.
So, you know what?
Those are the people that want to put the responsibility on the game publishers.
The ones that are saying, oh well, I didn't know that this game says over 18.
I thought that my son was okay because he's 13.
No, okay, so, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Anyway, you know, we certainly are okay with the disagreement and opinion.
That's cool.
And we encourage, you know, if you guys have another email, send it on over to go at orangeonstrider.com, anybody that wants to say something.
Or, of course, you know, because we can only read so many emails a show, we do have the forums as well, and I'm going to be talking about that in a minute during some housekeeping.
But let's get to our second email tonight.
This is from rlove is the name of the person that sent this.
I like that name, rlove.
Our love wanted to ask, I just wanted to ask if you've heard anything about whether or not the current Logitech wireless controllers will be able to be used on PS3 and Xbox 360.
By the way, Josh Sweden is writing and directing Wonder Woman.
I'm not sure what I would be more worried about, how bad the movie will be or how crappy the obviously forthcoming game based on it will be.
It just proves once again Hollywood's total lack of creativity.
On the plus side, there has to be a Linda Carter cameo in it.
Anything else is sacrilege.
That, of course, related to the Wonder Woman story I mentioned last week.
Or was it two weeks ago?
I don't remember.
By the way, I read Uwe Boll had an interview on 1UP.com this week, and he thinks his movies are good.
Whoa, there's someone that has no grasp of reality right there.
Yes, I did hear about Joss Whedon doing the Wonder Woman movie or Buffy the Lasso Slayer.
No, I don't know.
No, I liked Buffy the show.
I'm not hardcore about, like, my roommate.
Just so you guys know, my roommate is hardcore Buffy Angel fan.
He's hard fucking core.
He has all the DVDs.
For the record, he has the Buffy soundtrack right here on his computer desk.
Don't tell Extra for this, but he listens to the music in his car and everything.
I even know the songs.
Not that there's anything wrong with that.
I like Buffy, but he's hardcore.
I'm sure the movie's going to be cool.
I think Serenity looks pretty cool.
That's a Joss Whedon thing, too.
Serenity looks pretty badass.
So we'll see.
Who knows?
Can't really say until we start seeing some actual footage from the movie.
But Joss Whedon does have that little sense of humor.
That's the one thing I did like about Buffy is it was very tongue-in-cheek.
So if the Wonder Woman movie, it could benefit from that.
Here's the other part of the letter, of course, the Logitech wireless controllers being able to be used on PS3 and Xbox 360.
I would guess no, because PS3's really changed their controller from the ground up.
It looks, I mean, the boomerang style controller now.
I just think, and especially now, aren't they going Bluetooth as well?
I don't even know.
I have a feeling they are.
Don't count on it.
We don't know for sure, our love, but don't count on it.
with massive lag, because that's what's going to happen.
You know what?
Sadly, I think you're just going to have to upgrade your controller to one of the new wireless controllers.
But don't quote me on it.
I'm not on the inside.
I don't know for sure, but I would just think because of the drastic change that both controllers are going through physically, I just don't see it happening.
Yeah, that does suck, because I liked using my DualShock...
PS1 controllers with my PlayStation 2 because I was a cheap bastard.
I know the Xbox 360 one can't work because they added an extra button.
They added the media center button.
So I just, I don't see it working.
The Xbox 360 button is useless.
It is.
But it's there.
The ring of light.
It's just a button.
Alright, again, if you want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaundrydo.com Square Enix and Namco announced their lineup for the Tokyo Game Show.
Namco is going to be showing...
Tales of the Abyss, Soul Calibur III, Critical Velocity, MotoGP4, and Urban Reign for the PS2, Ridge Racer 6, and Frame City Killer for the Xbox 360, and some other games, including Tales of Eternia Online for the PC.
Squeenix will be showing Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebrus, Kingdom Hearts II, Code Age Commanders for the PS2, and on PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox 360.
Final Fantasy XI as to what capacity they'll be showing Final Fantasy XI on 360, don't know yet.
And for all those waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2 to be coming out in October, guess what?
It's coming out next year.
Really?
When did you find that out?
I found that out from the Square Enix guy.
I haven't heard that announced.
It's not coming out until next year.
It got pushed out of this year.
You were here first.
The big one coming out this year from Square Enix, Dragon Quest VIII.
That's going to be the big one.
But Kingdom Hearts, it went bye-bye.
Oh, I did not know that.
That's news to me.
Yep, next year.
Interesting.
Okay.
What I also thought was interesting is Square Enix is going to be showing EverQuest 2 because I guess they have the distribution rights overseas to that one, which I think is interesting.
Notice what's missing.
Front Mission 5 and, hello, Final Fantasy 12.
Missing from the showing list at Tokyo Game Show.
Missing... That's a... I hope the... Man, don't you start to worry that the game's just going to get called off.
I'd be so mad.
Because the E3 demo a year and a half ago was so pretty.
You know, I'm saying at this point it's probably going to be next gen.
It's got to be.
I mean, think about it.
I'm probably like, eh, fine.
I don't know about that.
I don't know about that.
Extreme Ghouls and Ghosts coming out for the PSP.
That is confirmed by Famitsu Magazine.
Of course, this being based on the Ghouls and Ghosts series, which dates back to the 80s.
It was reinvented on the PS2, etc., etc., etc.
The PSP version will have branching paths as determined by certain warp points.
Each path having its own treasure so you can replay certain levels.
So, you know, just trying to add something a little new to the game, I guess.
Ghouls N' Ghosts, good game, although it's been redone about a gazillion times.
But I'm still very loyal to the old Super Nintendo, Super Ghouls N' Ghosts.
So we'll see how the PSP one turns out a little later when this game comes out.
I guess next year.
I don't really see a date for this one, so we'll see.
I want to get into some housekeeping tonight, some various housekeeping news on tonight's podcast.
First off, we've made some changes to the website, just little, little changes.
Our forums, we've actually restructured them.
So we have a forum strictly for podcast talk now.
So if you have some feedback, you want to talk about something we've talked about on the podcast,
One of our stories, perhaps further discussion on Hot Coffee Mod.
We encourage you to go to our forums, www.orangeonsradio.com.
We have a brand new Orange Ons Radio podcast forum.
We're just trying to breathe some life into our forums because freaking nobody posts there.
So we might have to do a giveaway or something to a random post to try and get incentive because we like it when people post there.
It gives me something to read at work when I should be working as I'm sure a lot of you feel about it.
Also, we're going to be adding to our page a links section that will be specific for each podcast.
So some popular links that we talk about because a lot of folks have been complaining, well, you read these links and they're huge and we have no way to find these sites.
So we're going to add a links section that we can index the links by podcast.
And I actually want to give you a couple links that have to do with some show things.
First one is one of our listeners.
One of our listeners, a guy that goes by DJ Ranma S, who lives out on the East Coast, he actually has a really creative idea for Hurricane Katrina relief.
And of course, Hurricane Katrina was a huge impact this past week, and we know we had some very close listeners, some longtime fans of Orange Launch Radio dating back to, you know, 2000... When did we start this thing?
2002?
Back to 2002 when we first started with the live station, we're affected and lost everything, and we just...
It's so horrible to hear about, and I don't want to get too grim details, because you're here to hear about video games.
But I think what DJ Ranma S is doing is really cool.
As you guys know, I'm sure you've seen on many of the popular websites, you can donate to the Red Cross.
But maybe you're thinking, gosh, I don't really have money to give to the Red Cross.
Well, DJ Ranma S is actually really big in the cosplay community.
So he thought, well, what do we do in the cosplay community?
We're constantly...
Thank you for watching!
They're doing this a lot on the East Coast, but they're trying to organize collection spots throughout the country.
Check it out.
It's DJRanmaS.net slash HTML slash project underscore relief dot HTML.
We will, of course, put a link.
I know.
See, that's such a huge link.
We're going to put a link on OrangeLaundry.com so you guys can check that out.
So thank you, Ranma S, for putting that together, and we'll see what we can do.
Put together as a donation for that.
I think that's a great idea.
Also, this is one of those things I should have mentioned last week on the show, but there's an independent record label that actually started up in the Sacramento area, and they do kind of goth, industrial-style music, which if you're into Ultramix 2 or DDR Ultramix 3 lately, seems to be having quite a bit of that.
And actually, the administrator of the DDR Freaks forums, Iguana Girl, is actually throwing her...
Dark Records in Clothing
So good luck to those guys.
Support independent music, guys.
Funny enough, I was just talking to my friend earlier today who lives up around this area.
And he had mentioned a co-worker being a DJ and saying, yeah, his name's DJ Illogical Beats.
And he has this thing coming out with Blood and Synth.
I'm like, I read that on a friend's live journal on Iguana Girls, actually, no less.
And I was like, wow, man, this world just gets smaller and smaller.
Amazing.
Yeah, he's a co-worker of his.
Wow, that's very cool.
Kevin Bacon, man.
All right, check that out, you guys.
We definitely want to support the independent record labels, especially the ones that have been supporting us.
So check that out.
Metal Slug 6 is coming out on SNK Playmore
It's the seventh installment in the Metal Slug series because of Metal Slug X, and it's being developed for Sammy's Atomos Wave platform, which would of course be a little bit different than the Neo Geo arcade system you're used to.
So this is a new arcade game that's coming out.
Metal Slug 6, I know there's a lot of Metal Slug fans out there, so I just thought I'd
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Mario Kart Arcade Game
Sweet Coden 5 is on its way and a playable demo of the game will be available at Tokyo Game Show September 16th through 18th.
Sweet Coden 5 taking place in the Queendom of Felina, a kingdom which was referred to a few times in the previous games.
Don't know quite about the time frame of Sweet Coden 5, but I hear it's going to be pretty good.
I hear if you were disappointed by Sweet Coden 4, Sweet Coden 5 will make things better.
That, of course, coming out for the PlayStation 2.
It will not be a next-gen game.
It's going to be PlayStation 2.
You also have to figure that Suikoden Tactics is going to be in there somewhere, too.
That's right.
So Suikoden, big thing for Konami right now.
Unlock all those million characters that are in the game.
Advent Children, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, going to be getting its own title song.
Of course, title songs being a big thing in Square games.
You know, Simple and Clean, Eyes on Me, you know.
Advent Children, even though it's not a game, it's a movie, has its own song.
Um...
Kyusuki Himiro with Calling but the weird thing is it's actually from his 1989 album Neo Fasico but that's the theme song and supposedly says the Advent Children director Tetsuya Nomura for the setting of Advent Children it's very fitting so an old 80s classic make its way I got another email the other day saying it's going to be November 30th or 29th so November 29th
Like I said before, son of a bitch, they pushed it back.
The soundtrack is supposedly being released September 28th.
Good for them.
In Japan.
All I'm hoping is to see a copy when it's leaked to the internet, which will be the day after.
For those of you guys that were kind of ticked off at Xbox 360's dual level pricing thing going on, PlayStation 3 would just like you to know, well at least on British website gamesindustry.biz, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Vice President Phil Harrison said, doing that multiple pricing level for PlayStation 3, unlikely.
So you don't have to worry about this.
You'll just be shelling out $500 for the PlayStation 3 to start.
No, I'm kidding.
I'm kidding.
I don't know.
I don't know.
Well, let me just put it this way.
It's not going to be cheap.
Also says Phil Harrison, are there two versions of the Xbox 360 that people want to buy?
I don't know.
I look at those formats.
I think it just confuses the audience.
They don't know which one to buy.
Developers don't know which one to create for.
And retailers don't know which one to stock.
So I think we wouldn't take that strategy.
We wouldn't want to create confusion.
They made some huge mistakes doing the double skews on those.
First one being is now there's no guarantee that there's going to be a hard drive in there.
Developers can't develop their games with hard drive support.
The other thing that they made a mistake on is that there's only a DVD drive in there, not like any next-gen format.
They're running out of space on the DVDs to put the games in.
They're going to run into a lot of hurdles with this thing, and it's not looking good.
We'll see, we'll see.
King of Fighters just came out this week for the Xbox.
Just kind of wanted to tip our hat at that one.
2002 and 2003 editions coming out for the Xbox.
By the way, it was actually already released for the PlayStation 2, but this has Xbox Live support.
For those of you guys that are into King of Farters... Did I say King of Farters?
It's always King of Farters!
Yeah, we're definitely running late here on the show.
Sony, possibly, also, by the way, something that was said by Phil Harrison, boy, this guy's got a big mouth lately, but that's good, we like guys with big mouths, because it gives us a hint to what these companies are thinking.
Possibly charging for PSP downloads in 2006.
Hmm.
Saying that possibly Wipeout Pier was kind of like a test case for something that could be coming in the future.
He says...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't know.
I know what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to work.
All right.
Last story tonight, the last story.
Bungie, the folks behind Halo, getting into the Hurricane Katrina relief.
This is pretty cool.
They've created a custom t-shirt, and the custom t-shirt shows a little Master Chief, and he looks like he's kind of kicking some hurricane butt there, like literally.
I don't know what that's... It actually looks like a giant cotton ball with teeth, but I think it's supposed to be a hurricane.
Kicking it, saying, fight the flood.
And they're selling this little custom shirt, trying to get gamers to show support.
They're saying that roughly $15 of each shirt sold...
We'll go directly to the hurricane relief effort.
So if you're interested in checking that out, head on over to Bungie.net and check that out.
We'll also, of course, provide a link to that on our new links page.
So that's that.
The other thing about speaking a little bit about Xbox here, Origin Xbox 360, another viral site.
The countdown is going to be done on Monday the 26th of this month.
So we'll know what that is.
DarkSakura.com
All I know is I was smart this time and did not pre-book my system at the mall.
I did a really small game stop that's nearby my house so I can go pick it up and leave.
Sounds good.
Alright, wow, we broke an hour tonight, kids.
Our first podcast over an hour in length.
It's definitely time to wrap it up.
We just have a lot to say.
And plus, you know, we've been doing a little drinking, so we're rambling.
Drink responsibly, kids.
Don't drink and drive.
I won't.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
Mel B, thank you for being here tonight.
Appreciate you kind of filling in for DarkSakura the last half of the show.
Well, thanks for having me.
I mean, I guess being the first guest on the podcast, you know, this means something.
I mean, see, wasn't I there for like the first Orange Lounge promo as well?
One of our first promo.
You were there like probably within the first two months of our live program way back in 2002.
So, you know, as we say in the hood, I ain't new to it.
I'm true to it.
Well, we appreciate you being loyal to us.
Thank you very much, and thank you for your tips earlier on tonight on the game industry.
Oh yeah, definitely, no problem, man.
Hopefully I'll be back for another show, be a podcaster live, and of course I'll probably be bringing in a couple more new CDs along the way.
You didn't touch on that on the podcast.
Not on the podcast, but we did talk about it on another program that we do for Orange Launch Radio.
The new CDs by Zonk and Orifiz, which are going to be actually part of Ultramix 3.
Actually, I'm not sure about Zonk's involvement in Ultramix 3, but Orifiz being one of them.
Yeah, Orifiz, definitely.
Basile, the song, will be in Ultramix 3.
I talked to Dave, who is the guy behind Orifiz and actually is also one of the musicians on Zonk.
and he said that they're looking into a possible download for a future song.
I mean, yeah, I've gotten to hear them.
I actually got to see them in concert a couple times, you know, just in the past couple months.
They're actually going to be taking a break from touring because the lead singer is actually having a baby.
Oh, nice.
Yeah.
Very cool.
Well, I like supporting the independent music, so check this out, www.zonkaholics.com.
So think zonk like let's make a deal, zonkaholics.com.
Check out more info on that.
Thanks for being here, Moe.
Loki, your final thought.
Thanks to all the publishers that I gave those wonderful press kits out to that are listening to the show.
All, like, a few of you, but Namco, dude, if you're listening, sorry I ripped on your game tonight, but it really did suck.
I don't think you gave one to Namco, actually.
Oh, okay, well then.
I don't remember, because I like other, Katamari Damacy, love it.
Konami's got one.
I gave one to the Tomo guy, which is awesome.
They were great.
We're actually supposed to go, now this is funny, we're supposed to be going with Daniel and Eric
from Tomo, or no, not Daniel, Tomo, or the guy from Koei and the guy from Agetech or Tomo, the guy, basic company that distributes them.
Ah, stop, Nate.
Anyways, anyways, okay.
We're supposed to go in whitewater rafting in the spring, which is interesting.
Huh.
How's that for company relationships?
But, no, it was really fun.
I enjoyed, you know, talking with them.
I talked their ears off about their product, and I'm glad that, you know,
I had someone talk to who actually understood what I was talking to.
Well, hopefully, you know, they understood, you know.
But it was just, you know, it was fun.
And really, I got to learn a lot of stuff and make those connections that we really needed to make.
And hopefully, Daniel at Konami is going to be sending me those VRares for...
Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3.
And hopefully some of these companies will listen to your pleas for prizes that we're going to turn around and give to our listeners.
Yeah, you know, we plug a lot of the games out here.
We talk about everything that comes out and everything, and it's really cool, and I love playing everything out there.
I play whatever I get my hands on, so...
My final thought is we've got to wrap this stuff up.
We're over an hour tonight, but I truly want to thank you guys for listening to us and supporting us.
Our shows just continue to grow in the six months we've been doing it.
Actually, no, God, it's been like nine months now.
Thank you guys so much.
Tell a friend about the show.
You can always throw us a vote on Podcast Alley or one of the other podcast sites.
Just help us spread the word.
That's the best way that we can continue to grow.
More big things will be coming.
Maybe we'll break the two-hour mark soon enough.
No, we've got to...
We're going to keep these shows under an hour usually.
But thank you guys for listening and we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
Happy gaming!
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update!
