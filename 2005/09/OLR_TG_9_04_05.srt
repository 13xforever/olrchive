14
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:08,720

00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,200
little picture a dark soccer right in the corner. Yeah and it's like an

16
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,800
overhead shot because I was holding my phone up that way. It's an artsy shot. I was just

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,100

20
00:01:30,860 --> 00:01:37,660
get through yes that would happen being that we are having a little bit alcohol

21
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:41,260
because there is a holiday weekend yes it's Labor Day weekend so we were doing

22
00:01:41,260 --> 00:01:44,760
a little bit of drinking for our live show tonight except thanks to technical

00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:47,980
difficulties live 365 our live show didn't happen so we've just been

24
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:53,260
enjoying some drinks yeah technically the live show yeah well the ferret has

25
00:01:53,260 --> 00:01:58,900
something to say about that what's that thank you we have a podcast guest

26
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,180
tonight we don't allow guests on the show very often so this guest is very

27
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:07,820
very extra special first rule of podcast is do not talk about podcast say hello

28
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:11,700
to Mel B is here tonight greetings everybody from the only sober one in

29
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:16,460
this room so far how you doing Mel I'm doing that pretty good actually you know

30
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:22,140
For those that may not know you why why are you an internet celebrity? We're gonna make all our podcast guests say this now

31
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,940
Why are you an internet celebrity?

32
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,700
Wow, I guess it happened all about five years ago when someone

33
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,820
clicked on a link on a DDR site and saw a video of me dancing and

34
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:37,060
like this is back when Dance Dance Revolution had a

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:43,700
Freestyle and people were in the community and doing fun things and trying new things and it was basically it was kind of like Dance

36
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,120
Dance Dance Revolution out in America just wasn't big at the time it was like a kind

37
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,740
of a cult hit because people who were into like Japan gaming or just like anime or whatever

38
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:56,820
or just rhythm games it just what there wasn't a big following so when there was internet

39
00:02:56,820 --> 00:03:00,700
stuff going on things being passed around it was like little did we know at the time

40
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,200
it was a grassroots movement that was going to boom into something that became a multi-million

41
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,000
dollar selling franchise so yeah I guess in a way people see me in the Dance Dance Revolution

42
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:15,960
community as someone who kind of helped promote it helped you know make the game

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,880
kind of fashionable to play I guess right on now you actually got to work on

44
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:24,080
some of the DDR home releases right oh yes I did I worked in Konami digital

45
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,960
entertainment over in Redwood City for about two years work in a lot of testing

46
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:35,920
so I did have a hand in testing both Xbox versions um both in dance in

47
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,920
Ultramix and Ultramix 2, did some stuff for Xtreme and among other things.

48
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Very cool, and any other game companies that you've had experience with?

49
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:49,920
I had a cup of coffee with Namco for a couple months, you know, and that's really about it.

50
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,920
Right now I'm not working in the game industry, but I'd definitely like to be back later.

51
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,920
So, for a lot of our podcast listeners out there who listen to this, you know, they live all over the world,

52
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:02,920
what's it like to work on the inside, working for the game company?

53
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:08,520
It's kind of like almost any other job that you know, you kind of always dream about working, you know

54
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,680
It's like anytime you hear a video game test and you think wow

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,240
I get to play with games all day long that must be the most kickback job and to most extent

56
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:19,400
Yes, it is a pretty kickback job. You know, it's like you get paid to do something you do pretty much

57
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,680
You know something that you do at home sitting on your ass getting paid nothing, you know

58
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:31,200
But it's as with any job there are positives and negatives negatives is man if you're like say a big fan of one game

59
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:35,720
playing it 40 hours a week for eight weeks straight you're gonna learn to not

60
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:39,760
like it as much. So you get a little burned out on DDR after playing it so

61
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:44,400
much. Yeah you do and I mean there's just whole other you know types of things

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
especially when you work in quality assurance but with any other job QA is

63
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,040
sort of like you're the grunt of the company you know I mean a lot of people

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:55,400
go into that thinking oh I can become a developer out of it or a producer and in

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,440
some cases you can it just depends on the company I mean if it's a really huge

66
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,960
company it's like you're one of like 250 300 people that are trying to you know

67
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,360
jump ahead make that next step if you're in a smaller company chances are you

68
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,920
know you do have a shot at making it so you know I'm not by no means discouraging

69
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:15,160
anyone from doing anything I mean just do what you like and I like doing what I

70
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,800
did have no regrets and like I said I'd like to be back sometime all right very

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,760
cool any quick advice for somebody who wants to get their foot in the door in

72
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,180
the game industry um it's really not that hard to get into testing really

73
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:30,860
Essentially you just go on to corporate websites if you have a gaming company around in your area

74
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,160
Especially like in whether you're in the Bay Area of California or you're in Southern California or like Florida or some places

75
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:38,880
Just check out the corporate sites just get in testing

76
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,400
I mean when you're going to the job interview just let them know like especially on your resume and stuff

77
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,920
List down every single console that you've played talk about the types of games you are interested in talk about

78
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,840
You know like games that you know you mastered, you know, because people like to know like wow

79
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:58,560
There's you know, probably some hidden things that you found out that we thought no one else would and then you do you just learn basically

80
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:03,500
That being a tester isn't just playing games. It's you're trying to break the game more than anything

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,740
So you have to do all sorts of crazy stuff

82
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,620
like if you're playing a

83
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:12,420
Racing game you have to try driving backwards and see if you could crash the game because that's what you're paid to do

84
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:17,320
You're paid to break the game. Very interesting. All right. Well for those of our listeners curious out there

85
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,760
I'm sure that's some good advice

86
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:22,800
So thank you for that and Mel B will be here throughout the show to just um

87
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:27,480
Give his give his big fat opinion like we all do on the video games as we talked about tonight

88
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,200
So we're gonna start off tonight show as we usually do talking about the games. We have been playing this week now dark soccer

89
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,160
I know is a big week for you getting married and hitched and all that

90
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,920
But I know you've at least been playing the puppies. So what do you been playing this week? I've been playing the puppies

91
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,560
I just got my second dog tonight. My first one is a corgi named I'm

92
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,840
My second one, see I'm going for the anime themed dog, so now I have a Shiba Inu named

93
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,840
Menchi.

94
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:00,360
He has in from XL Saga, who seems like a fairly well behaved doggy so far.

95
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:06,240
As far as other games, they're ones I can't really talk about on air, so I'm gonna leave

96
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,240
those alone.

97
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,240
Oh yeah, and we are probably within the next couple weeks gonna be starting up on World

98
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,240
of Warcraft.

99
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,240
Oh boy, okay, well we need somebody from this show to be in there to give us updates, so...

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:24,240
Yyyyep. I'm gonna play an undead rogue, or a priest.

101
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
Undead priest, undead rogue.

102
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Or I'm gonna be playing a night elf hunter on another server.

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,240
Haven't made a decision yet, huh? What are they doing?

104
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,240
I hear that their expansion that they're doing for World of Warcraft, it's free.

105
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,240
Oh, interesting.

106
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,240
Downloadable.

107
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,440
Because they figured that the users, they're giving them a little kickback because they've paid enough.

108
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,440
Wow!

109
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,440
Yeah!

110
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,200
Square Enix needs to take a hint here.

111
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,680
And also though, with your first month of World of Warcraft, you do pay nothing.

112
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,560
Well yeah, a lot of MMOs do that though, one month at a time.

113
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,840
Ragnarok doesn't, bastard.

114
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,840
F-Ragnarok.

115
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,720
So, they give you the first month free because, you know, it's like any other drug dealer, man.

116
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,360
They give you that first hit for, you know, a discount price, then you gotta come back,

117
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,060
then they know there's demand, then, you know, they got you.

118
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,060
That's right.

119
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:15,160
It's like, get your first dose of heroines free.

120
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:16,160
Anyway.

121
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:21,840
Now, Dark Sakura, since you weren't here last week, Loki and I gave our impressions on Nintendogs.

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,360
Were you impressed with the Nintendogs compared to what you saw at E3, or?

123
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,360
The boobies!

124
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,360
The boobies!

125
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,880
But besides the cuteness factor.

126
00:08:29,880 --> 00:08:31,880
My dog is retarded.

127
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:39,020
I'm doesn't get it I gave him the lay down command sounds too much like sit

128
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:43,840
down so we might tell him to sit down he lays down although I renamed the roll

129
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:48,440
over to play dead so he sticks his legs in the year his little stub legs he is

130
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,400
excellent when it comes to the frisbee though he makes me lots of money so

131
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:59,880
would you recommend the game to somebody else yes why yes because the puppies the

132
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:04,320
cuteness factor. You have to feed your puppies. You have to bathe your puppies and you have

133
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,400
to pet your puppies and you have to take them for a walk and remember to clean up their

134
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:15,120
crap. Is Nintendogs as annoying as a Tamagotchi? Tamagotchi was really stupid. I have a Digimon

135
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,200
still. I have an old school Digimon. Why is Nintendogs not stupid? Because they don't

136
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,880
look like little digital blips on the screen. Your puppy likes you too and he jumps and

137
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:29,140
He plays Bone, he plays Fizbee, and he throws Fizbee like,

138
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:31,140
BULLSHIT, YOU JUST THREW IT AWAY, WHY SHOULD I BE-

139
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
OKAY HERE.

140
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,760
So they got a lot of personality.

141
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:35,640
He was a puppy.

142
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,140
Alright.

143
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:38,640
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

144
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,940
I like throwing the Bark Ball at my Nintendog because it's afraid of it.

145
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
It reminds me so much of my mom's dog,

146
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,940
because my mom's chihuahua is afraid of everything, so.

147
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,400
I hit my puppy in the head the first time with the Bark Ball.

148
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,240
And I went,

149
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:52,740
EH!

150
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,700
Like that.

151
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:54,700
What will be?

152
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:27,060
I don't like it. So, you know, it's just

153
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,740
really repetitive. It's just not my thing. So,

154
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:33,980
the hell with that. We got the Namco Battle Collection.

155
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,300
Classic games, if I'm really bored, maybe.

156
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,820
But I'm not too big a fan of that. I did like, however, you did the PSP

157
00:10:42,820 --> 00:10:46,500
GameSend for me. Yeah, GameSharing. Okay, GameSharing.

158
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:50,860
You did the GameSharing feature for me so I could play the little demos.

159
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:54,380
I was a little disappointed that they were only first round demos, but there were a

160
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,660
heck of a lot of demos on there.

161
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,320
You know, Dig Dug, Rally X, now granted it's the same game from the eighties, but

162
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:00,820
still

163
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,580
to be able for you to send those to me for free was kinda neat.

164
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:07,180
You know, there was a lot of games on there and they did also they have these

165
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:09,340
arrangement games, four different arrangement games,

166
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,260
which are kinda updated graphics, it's almost like the game is remade, which was

167
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,500
really cool, those are really cool.

168
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:18,860
And Rally X arrangement, that's the only place you can play Rally X Arrangement, that's one of my favorite

169
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:19,740
arrangement games I ever did.

170
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:24,640
Yeah, and I think that they're actually they have the rally X and they have new rally X which I think new rally X is

171
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,640
The one that was on the Ridge Racer

172
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,280
New rally X is a there's really no different rally X arrangements work. But yeah, okay. So anyways, it was really cool

173
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,760
Um, and then I also I have depth jr. But I haven't gotten the plate yet looks cool

174
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,340
Just you know, hopefully this time I can hear the sound unlike e3

175
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:46,440
Then I have a lot of PlayStation 2 games. I'm playing I played this street racing game

176
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:51,220
I don't remember was called now sucked, but it was for the Japanese system

177
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,440
Then playing still more burnout 3 we've been actually doing to play rage mode now

178
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:02,400
And that's a whole lot more fun. It was when you add another player and they crashed in their cargos flying over you

179
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,400
Oh, that's really cool

180
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:10,080
Played burnout legends the demo for that that game is so much better than burnout 3 and it's gonna fucking rock

181
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:12,080
I'm buying it as soon as it comes out

182
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,320
What's great about it is you can actually do the crash breaker where you make your car

183
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,840
explode every time you crash.

184
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,840
I love that.

185
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,840
That's fucking awesome.

186
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:24,120
And plus there's jumps and it's a lot faster so it's really cool.

187
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,840
Then on top of that I played actually with my DS a little bit because I got some more

188
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,840
games.

189
00:12:28,840 --> 00:12:29,840
I got pack and roll which was really interesting.

190
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,520
I love pack and roll.

191
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,760
It's just not really my thing but it's a lot better than pack picks that's for sure because

192
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,760
that game kind of sucks.

193
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,760
Pack picks was awesome.

194
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:43,600
Anyways, so then I also played the DS version of Star Wars Episode III, and that was actually

195
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:44,600
pretty cool.

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,960
It looked like a really good Super Nintendo game, that's what it reminded me of.

197
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,760
What's the DS feature in that game?

198
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:56,240
Well, in some of the stuff it's just a status screen, in other ones it's just like you can

199
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,920
use it for the flight sim parts and stuff like that.

200
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:04,240
It's mainly they don't really use touch screen stuff that much, but it's just kind of...

201
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,200
I've said this on a previous episode, you don't have to whore the touch thing in every

202
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,200
game.

203
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,100
The dual screen thing is fine, I mean, make use of that.

204
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,960
Some other things I was going to mention though, at the conference thing, they were talking

205
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:19,800
about the game coming out from Konami, Lost in Blue.

206
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:22,760
They're doing a lot of things with the DS that fucking rock.

207
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,760
For example, there's one part where you have to make fire.

208
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:31,440
You take the stylus and you rub it between your hands like it's a stick, and you're rubbing

209
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,320
sticks together to make fire.

210
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,020
you're cooking fish and in order to cook the fish it's like on a barbecue so you can actually

211
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:43,900
close the lid of the DS and the fish will cook faster and you can actually might overcook

212
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:47,940
the fish if you do stuff like that but they're doing some really innovative stuff with that.

213
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:49,340
Weird, that's wacky.

214
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:55,380
But just it was really amazing and I have to say after seeing all the 360 footage, seeing

215
00:13:55,380 --> 00:14:00,620
Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter, Tom Clancy's new game, it fucking looks sexy.

216
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:04,300
I don't even like first-person shooters, but oh my god does that look sexy.

217
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,680
What was that insider info you were telling me about 360 before the show?

218
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,980
Oh, 360, a few things. Um, they're only shipping 700,000 to 1 million units

219
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:18,440
at launch. Um, so, you know, that's why you... You heard it here first.

220
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,880
You heard it here first. Yeah, I mean, that's not really known. Um,

221
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:26,160
and for backwards compatibility, you have to have the hard drive.

222
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:29,500
No hard drive, no playing the old games.

223
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,580
interest I did not I've not read that anywhere

224
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:37,140
and interesting got some information out there but I'm also going to support a

225
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:38,460
few games at launch

226
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,780
and they're gonna be adding more every two weeks why do you have to have the

227
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,340
hard drive for backwards compatibility

228
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,940
I don't know because because the emulators gonna be on the drive right

229
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:49,260
is that what is something like that Mel thinks he knows what's going on

230
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:52,180
essentially the way they have to you have reverse it you know engineer you

231
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,460
know

232
00:14:52,460 --> 00:14:56,000
play backwards compatibility is they have to have software for it and their thing is they

233
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:56,420
haven't

234
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:59,780
officially finished it out yet so thing is you're gonna have to have the hard drive

235
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:01,700
available so when it's ready then you know

236
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,180
you can download it or whatever I'm not sure how it works but

237
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,480
interesting yeah because it's not basically the backwards thing hasn't

238
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,260
been finished yet

239
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:12,940
if you think about the Xbox Live Silver that they're talking about

240
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:16,380
you know you're like oh I can play some online games nope think again you gotta buy the

241
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:16,780
Xbox Live

242
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,700
I'm gonna get to a story about that in a little bit. Anyways okay so we got that okay

243
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:23,580
there's another thing that they're adding with Xbox Live that's really cool spectator mode

244
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:26,860
so for example they're doing the Madden challenge with the new next-gen

245
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:30,380
Madden game you can go in watch the game

246
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:34,500
watch him as a spectator watch people play you know racing games everything so

247
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,700
that's a new thing that they have spectator mode on that

248
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,740
and the webcam sounds good

249
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:44,260
as far as my gaming week I haven't played a whole lot of new games I did go

250
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:47,020
out and do some impulse buys the other day I was at Fry's which is like this

251
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,980
huge electronics store here that sells a lot of games

252
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:52,060
and they have a lot of cheap games so I was looking through their twenty dollar games

253
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:55,940
I picked up on Namco 50th Anniversary Collection because it was only $15

254
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,260
and the Namco 50th Anniversary Collection has like 14 old Namco games in it

255
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,380
Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man

256
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:04,140
and this is the one where I was talking about a few weeks on the show has

257
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,460
licensed music in it

258
00:16:05,460 --> 00:16:08,700
like it has Dexys Midnight Runners, come on Eileen, it has

259
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:13,660
She Drives Me Crazy, like all those songs. Okay, Namco 50th Anniversary Collection

260
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:17,780
sucks. I do not recommend this game. I'm sorry to say

261
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:21,020
I love Namco. This collection sucks

262
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,220
balls and the reason why they've done this before

263
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,420
many times on PlayStation 1 and

264
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:32,620
next-gen, er, well I shouldn't say next-gen, but you know, current gen I guess would be

265
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,180
a way to say it.

266
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,220
Current gen since they've already done this. Granted there's a couple a new games

267
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,980
here like what the King

268
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,500
well there's one on the PSP I think the uh...King of the Balloon or something?

269
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,540
King of the Balloon which blows anyway and there's one on the

270
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,060
the 50th anniversary collection like King and Dry, I don't even know what it's called

271
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:49,900
it's it's that

272
00:16:49,900 --> 00:16:51,580
Unimpressive to me

273
00:16:51,580 --> 00:16:57,160
Here's what ticked me off about it the music this music thing that they had been hyping up on the news sites

274
00:16:57,920 --> 00:17:02,040
Granted I will give Namco credit because they didn't advertise this on the box that had 80 music

275
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,020
But you don't have it during the actual game. The only time you hear this is in the menu

276
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,620
That's it. So when you go into the actual game

277
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,880
There's no music nothing

278
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:19,120
Yeah, it actually did the same thing for the Activision collection because you know, there was cool ladies music in the like menu screens

279
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:21,900
But when you play it still blip it's boring to me

280
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:27,080
And they there wasn't really the array the arranged games were not nowhere to be seen

281
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:34,000
There were a couple unlocks. I just think there's so much more that could have been done with this Midway collections great stuff

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,020
Oh online ranking boards Xbox Live aware

283
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:41,020
Why didn't Namco implement a scoreboard?

284
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:45,080
Why didn't they they've got a great interface for the way the games are set up wouldn't

285
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:48,200
downloadable content be awesome for a retro collection like this?

286
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:52,440
Maybe if you were too busy being bought by Bondi. I guess, I don't know, but I

287
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:58,240
honestly, if you do not own any of these previous Namco collections, I suppose

288
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,500
this is a place to start because these are some important games

289
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,520
that are good and you should have in your collection, but honestly

290
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,880
I don't recommend this game. Even if you're a fan of classic gaming, get the other

291
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,160
Namco collections, they're better.

292
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,400
Or if you have a PSP, buy the Namco Battle Collection. Absolutely.

293
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:18,360
Now the Namco battle collection is cool. It's it's it's got the arranged versions in it. It's got the game beaming multiplayer

294
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:21,840
I think it works better on a handheld than it does on the console

295
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,240
If you are interested in this go get the PSP version do not buy the X thing, too

296
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:33,300
Is if the monitors were vertical or whatever you can adjust the orientation so that the monitors are taller and stuff. That's on there

297
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:40,100
Um, it's just really awesome. Cool. I did actually play other Konami games this weekend. What's up? Well, Dan and I went to the casino

298
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,900
Okay, it's a lot of machines hey he lost a dollar and I made 12

299
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:52,020
What else did I play? I bought dot hack part 1 because all of a sudden I'm like I want to get even though there's four

300
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,540
Parts. I'm like

301
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,900
I want to get into the dot hack games again because I played them a little bit and they're faux

302
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:02,460
MMOs where the the plot is that it's an MMO RPG, but it's not really an MMO RPG. You should watch the anime

303
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:07,020
I came free with an anime disc so I'm gonna watch it even though I'm not usually like really into anime

304
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,900
I'm gonna watch it. It's cool

305
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,060
By the way, if you want I do have the whole

306
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:17,620
First dot hack series. Well, maybe maybe if I get into it hands up. Hey, it's kind of an older game

307
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:23,620
But like I said, I was budget shopping this week because kids at orange launch radio. They're not giving us free games. Yeah

308
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:30,440
What what there's a certain game that you forgot to talk about. Hello. Hello kitty. Yeah

309
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:35,080
Yeah. Why did you play it? Because my friend has my GameCube, so I haven't been able to

310
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,960
get it back yet. Well, it's a good thing I didn't bring over another GameCube game for

311
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:44,520
you. Oh, damn you all! What'd you get me? What'd you get me? Killer7. Cool! Okay. My

312
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,400
GameCube is accessible. I will beat up my friend and get my GameCube out. And I have

313
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:54,360
a 50-inch widescreen TV. Do you happen to have a GunCon2? I have a 30-inch. I do indeed

314
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:59,720
have GunCon. I have two GunCon2s. I have a GunCon. Well, GunCon for the Playstation 2?

315
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,720
No, I have two of those.

316
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,720
Because I have the Dino one.

317
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,720
The Dino Crisis one.

318
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,720
Bring me more free games. I'm sick of questions.

319
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Game companies that are listening to us.

320
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,720
I have Neg Cons and Jog Cons.

321
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,720
We have lots of listeners. Send me free games.

322
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,720
I'm glad you mentioned that.

323
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,720
We do have game companies that will be listening to us.

324
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,720
Thanks to me.

325
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,720
Because I have done a lot of press kits.

326
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,720
Hi game companies!

327
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,720
Apparently EA does listen to

328
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,720
There's one guy at EA

329
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,360
that unlistens to gaming podcasts, not us, which made me sad, but, but, was it because

330
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,320
we kind of talk shit about Madden? No, we don't talk shit about Madden, I just don't

331
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:42,360
like Madden. I like Burnout, I talk much about Burnout, okay? I seem to remember reviewing

332
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:46,040
Battlefield 2 and my review was something along the lines of, what's the big idea? Battlefield

333
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,160
2 is friggin' sexy, let me tell you. It's a sexy looking game, man. No, no, no, it's

334
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:55,000
friggin' sexy. Okay, and I can tell you why it's sexy. They have this whole point of thing,

335
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,160
you you're attacking people whatever and you can switch point of views like that

336
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:02,120
and what's great about it though is like you'll be okay you're

337
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,360
say you're in a tank whatever and there's people coming across this

338
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,520
bridge you're attacking them oh now you don't have a really clear eye

339
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:11,720
so you really quickly zoom into someone else's point of view

340
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:15,800
and stuff like that it's for me it was what's the big big deal but but granted

341
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:19,480
i'm not a fan of this type of game i knew before i picked it up i wouldn't

342
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,120
probably would enjoy it i'm a single player multiplayer game that's what i

343
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:27,520
I mean, well, you know if you're into that kind of game, you'll probably really like it. I just not my type of game Mel

344
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,520
What's one game you've been playing this week? Mr. Mel B

345
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:36,120
Played a lot of quack shot on Genesis actually what made you decide to go to Genesis?

346
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,940
Oh, well, it actually was the classic gaming expo about two weeks ago

347
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:47,320
and so I checked it out and you're always going into retro stuff and just because my girlfriend had just pulled out her

348
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:52,800
her CDX actually because she was into Sega CD at the time when we were just trying to

349
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:56,340
basically get all our old gaming systems up on the TV going.

350
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:00,740
So we started going around buying stuff and the reason why, I mean I really loved Genesis

351
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:04,380
games back in the day, I thought it was one of the best systems out there.

352
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,300
And yeah, a lot of the Disney games that came out for Genesis Quackshot, Fantasia, Castle

353
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:13,280
of Illusions with Mickey Mouse, it was just some of the most fun side scrolling action

354
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:18,240
games I'd you know played at the time my 16-bit was a huge deal back then you

355
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:22,080
know oh yeah I remember did you see the guys um the guy that was making the

356
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:25,360
portable systems the custom portable systems at a classic game actually

357
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:30,400
yes be there yes I did see he's doing a Dreamcast portable systems now oh very

358
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:35,840
cool very cool all right anything else um see besides that I was playing a lot

359
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:42,240
of like old EA Sports like called Lakers versus Celtics Madden 93 back then but

360
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:47,160
As far as like current, well, more current games, actually was like for two days straight

361
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:52,960
I was just absolutely hooked on Bust A Move 2, Tengoku Mix, Japanese Playstation.

362
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,280
Main reason was because I picked it up for only $10 at the, uh, or as if you go on Ebay

363
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:00,360
or something like that you're paying at least $30 or $40 for that bad boy.

364
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:04,200
You want to see DER's granddaddy go pick up a copy of Bust A Move.

365
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:08,760
Actually that was, well the original Bust A Move was the reason why I got a modded Playstation

366
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,280
in the first place.

367
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,960
I was playing Bust A Move 2 before I was playing, well it was Bust A Groove here in the US,

368
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,320
so I was playing Bust A Groove before I was playing DDR, so.

369
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,000
Yeah, that was just a precursor to everything, and I mean after playing that it made me realize

370
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:28,520
how horrible Dance Summit 2001 was. I mean, that was just a huge step back for Enix at the time,

371
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:32,520
goodness, because it was like, I don't know why they ruined a franchise like that, because the

372
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:37,480
first two, um, parts, you know, first two, uh, games were awesome. You had personalities,

373
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:42,880
He had characters people got attached to the music was you know great the first one had like great novelty type songs

374
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,360
You know that would fit a video game, but the second one they did some really great production. They had guys from like

375
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:53,600
The front X yeah a vex earth wind and fire like Maurice white he did like hero couldn't steam

376
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,200
So I was like, you know, this was like something you could actually legitimately here

377
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:02,380
you know as mainstream pop radio and then just the third one totally took a step backwards and just

378
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:05,200
Everything you knew about the game and loved about the game was gone

379
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:16,200
You know, I think, I think Square and, uh, Enix, um, now that they've merged, they should do, um, they should do, like, a, a Final Fantasy dancing game with a bus. No, I'm kidding. It's gonna be horrible.

380
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Hey, I actually liked Dance Summit.

381
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:19,200
Really?

382
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:28,200
Honestly enough. But, you know, I was, Marius White also did anime stuff, too. He did the Gatchaman anime, so I was like, the second one's my favorite of the bunch.

383
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:32,600
But I did really like the third one. It had a very innovative idea and a special controller.

384
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,640
It made me think of the old ColecoVision

385
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,840
joystick one with the little four buttons on it.

386
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:42,520
Alright, we're going to get into some gaming news tonight, but before we get into the gaming news,

387
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:46,640
we're actually going to go ahead, and because DarkSakura, we don't know if she can stay for the whole show tonight,

388
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,960
we want to make sure she can bring her segment to you guys.

389
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,120
And of course, it's the one and only DarkSakura's advice column, because boys and girls,

390
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:59,120
If we stayed at home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and get married.

391
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
Right, DarkSakura?

392
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,120
I guess.

393
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:06,120
Alright, so DarkSakura, here's your advice column. What are you going to tell the kids about tonight?

394
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,120
If you're on your honeymoon, don't go do your podcast, because you never know when you're going to leave.

395
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,120
No, um, today's bit of advice is how to survive in a plummeting elevator.

396
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Elevators have numerous safety features.

397
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:23,520
There have been very few recorded incidents involving death from plummeting elevators.

398
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:28,560
In general, it is highly unlikely for a cable, also called traction elevator, to fall all

399
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,720
the way to the bottom of the shaft.

400
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:37,720
Moreover, the compressed air column in the elevator hoistway and the car buffers at the

401
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:42,520
bottom of the hoistway may keep the forces of the impact survivable.

402
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:45,920
Number one, flatten your body against the car floor.

403
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:49,320
They should distribute the force of impact rather than concentrate it on one area of

404
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,320
your body.

405
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,320
Standing may be difficult anyway.

406
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:53,140
I would have never thought of that.

407
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:58,040
Number two, cover your face and head to prevent them from sealing parts that may break loose.

408
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,560
But my final piece of advice.

409
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,560
Take the stairs fatass.

410
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:03,360
Take the fucking stairs.

411
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:08,040
And on that note, I will go ahead and give my final word of the show.

412
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,040
Yes honey.

413
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:12,720
Which is reject false icons and don't chug Guinness.

414
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Alright.

415
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Goodnight everyone.

416
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:19,500
DarkSaga for being here and have a good one and congratulations once again on getting

417
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
hitched.

418
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,360
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.

419
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:31,720
Started off with the Xbox 360, Xbox Live 2.0, the details are out and yes if you have a

420
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:38,000
silver subscription to Xbox Live you will be able to download game trailers, demos of

421
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,840
upcoming games, episode style content and you can create a profile, leave voice messages

422
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:49,720
for other live Xbox gamers the one thing you won't be able to do however is play

423
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:54,200
games head-to-head sorry you will have to have a gold membership in order to do

424
00:26:54,200 --> 00:27:00,440
that gold membership $7.99 a month for a one month subscription card but they do

425
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,360
have other ideas as well $19.99 for a three month option and let's see I

426
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:13,080
believe it's $49.99 for a 12 month subscription card you want the kit that

427
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:18,320
comes with a headset and all that stuff it's approximately $20 more depending on

428
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:22,720
what you get they're saying that there's a headset pack it's a three-month set

429
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:31,640
$10 rebate card on the game and joust from Xbox Live Arcade $39.99 so so most

430
00:27:31,640 --> 00:27:32,640
Joust!

431
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,640
Woohoo!

432
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,640
Joust!

433
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,640
Joust was a rad game!

434
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:38,640
Yeah!

435
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
Like in the 80s.

436
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,640
Seriously.

437
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,840
You know, you run around with lances and you steal people's egos, you know?

438
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:46,840
Lego my ego.

439
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:47,840
That was joust.

440
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,840
Oh god.

441
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,480
So, those of you guys that were hoping that the silver subscription would allow you to

442
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:53,480
play some games...

443
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:54,480
Sorry.

444
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Exactly.

445
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:56,480
Exactly.

446
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:02,720
The whole core system is a joke anyways, I mean, it's like, yeah, here's this Xbox, it

447
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,840
looks pretty but you can't do anything with it until you buy the rest.

448
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,040
If you're listening to this show, you're a hardcore enough gamer where if you're going

449
00:28:10,040 --> 00:28:15,400
to be buying a 360, you really need to consider the higher end, and I'm not saying that as

450
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:21,120
somebody who works for Microsoft, because I don't, but just do the math.

451
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:25,240
If you think that later on you might be interested in any of this stuff, such as the hard drive,

452
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:29,440
You're gonna end up paying more in the long run if you buy just the core system and then

453
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
all this stuff separately.

454
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,040
Hey, so you really need to think about this.

455
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:38,160
Hey folks, listen, um, the hard drive, just the laptop drive anyways, think about it folks,

456
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:43,780
buy the hard drive, upgrade it for free, or get the converter, you know I'm gonna be hooking

457
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:46,480
up like some 300 gig hard drive to that thing.

458
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:51,080
You know that's gonna happen, it's a matter of time.

459
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,360
Moving on in the news tonight, Dance Dance Revolution, a game that's near and dear to

460
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:57,960
our hearts because it's the whole reason we do Orange Launch Radio in one way or

461
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:04,080
another you could say. Won the Video Music Award for Best Video Game

462
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,880
Soundtrack. Pretty cool there and of course Dance Dance Revolution Extreme

463
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,560
has stuff by like Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, a couple of covers in there, BT as

464
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:20,960
well. The only thing they didn't actually show it as part of the show. And Dance

465
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:28,960
Dance Dance Revolution was there to comment, and their comment was, SUCK IT, HALO 2!

466
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:36,680
Wow, Blizzard won a pretty important hacking lawsuit this week.

467
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:39,600
I think this is kind of interesting, there was an appeals court, the 8th Circuit Court

468
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,480
of Appeals in St. Louis, and they ruled this week that federal law, specifically the DMCA,

469
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:50,920
or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, disallows players from altering Blizzard games to link

470
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:55,540
with servers other than the company's official Battle.net site.

471
00:29:55,540 --> 00:30:00,920
So there were defendants in this case, Ross Combs, Rob Critterden, they reverse engineered

472
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:07,560
Blizzard's protocol using some tools such as TCP Dump, and they had this project going

473
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:12,940
on, the Bnet-D, that would allow your Blizzard games to connect with unofficial servers.

474
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:16,480
And of course you get faster response times, all sorts of things that come along with using

475
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:22,020
on official servers, however Blizzard layeth the smack down for them reverse engineering

476
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,560
the program, so to speak.

477
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:28,020
What I find is interesting is I know a lot of people that have sort of done something

478
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:36,020
similar with Xbox Live, now I'm not too familiar on the exacts of how they hack, so it's probably

479
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:41,580
a different process, but I think it's interesting that this kind of sets a precedent in a way.

480
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,000
Well this is just, this is dumb. I think this is about like Starcraft if I remember correctly

481
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:51,320
and it was just servers that they're playing on. I mean, it's not like that you actually

482
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:56,480
have to pay for it, it's free, their servers, to place over, you know, the internet with

483
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,260
Starcraft but, um.

484
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,400
Maybe they're doing this for people to get banned, I don't know.

485
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:04,160
I don't know, they like banning people, they're just, what can I say.

486
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,720
Alright, let's get to another story. This one about Nintendogs, of course a game we

487
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,860
we have not shut up about for the past few weeks,

488
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,380
but this definitely is worth noting.

489
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:15,340
Quarter of a million units sold already.

490
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:17,140
In the first week, in the first week,

491
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,860
that's about 15% of the amount of people that own a DS,

492
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:23,980
which for a game in the first week of release

493
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,860
is pretty damn good.

494
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:27,900
A game that came out the same day,

495
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:31,300
Advance Wars Dual Strike, also selling pretty well.

496
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,300
So don't assume that Nintendogs

497
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:35,560
is the only must-own DS game right now.

498
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,260
Advance Wars, doing pretty well.

499
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:38,700
I haven't had a chance to check out that game myself,

500
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,840
but I've heard good things about it, so.

501
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:42,900
Got Battalion Wars coming out soon, too.

502
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:44,900
That's Advanced Wars for the GameCube.

503
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,420
We were talking about PSP Game Sharing a little bit

504
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,820
earlier in the show when I was talking about

505
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:53,140
that we were doing the Namco Battle Museum.

506
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,960
Tokyo Game Show is gonna be doing something

507
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,840
with the PSP Game Sharing.

508
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:59,420
If you're lucky enough to be going to the Tokyo Game Show

509
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:02,060
this year, which of course, in Tokyo,

510
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:05,880
they will be doing a PlayStation spot.

511
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:08,020
It's like a booth where the PSP owners

512
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:10,300
will be able to download demos of upcoming games

513
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:11,140
from the spot.

514
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,440
Where have I heard this before?

515
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,220
Oh yes, Nintendo's DS download booth at E3.

516
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:18,180
And how'd that work?

517
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,820
Oh yeah, that's right, not very well.

518
00:32:19,820 --> 00:32:21,480
It was okay, you just had to hammer in

519
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:22,900
to get what you wanted.

520
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:24,640
You could get what you wanted eventually,

521
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,100
but it was a little tricky.

522
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,340
But very interesting, Sony's doing a very similar thing

523
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,940
at Tokyo Game Show, if you're lucky enough to be going.

524
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:34,100
You'll be able to check out Metal Gear Acid 2,

525
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:39,440
Rengoku 2, Rockman Rockman, which of course is Mega Man's name overseas,

526
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:43,280
Baito Hell 2000, and Portable Resort.

527
00:32:43,280 --> 00:32:48,160
I haven't heard of those last two, but. Portable Resort's Namco, and it's weird.

528
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:53,600
Rengoku 2, I'm surprised they're even making a sequel to that.

529
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,400
The first one kinda sucked. Well, check it out. It's gonna be downloadable.

530
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:01,400
And then Rockman Legends. It's pretty cool, actually.

531
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,520
I played a little bit of it.

532
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,520
Yeah, how was that?

533
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:07,840
It's just a direct port of the Playstation game, that's all it is.

534
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,500
It's just a direct port, looks cool.

535
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,360
I'm excited about it, I wish they'd released more sequels, but you know.

536
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,920
Loki, you got a couple of hack and crack stories for us tonight?

537
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,480
Yes, yes I do.

538
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:27,200
The first on the list is the We Are Back group, you know, the ones behind several of the launchers

539
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,120
and the whole exploit, you know, to actually play homebrew stuff.

540
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,860
They've released a program to actually fake update your system.

541
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:42,560
So in other words, for example, on my system, which was a 1.5, because I have 2, but I upgraded

542
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,740
mine to a fake 1.5.2.

543
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:48,380
Which will allow me to play Namco Museum Collection which wants to upgrade your system if you

544
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:49,380
don't.

545
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,400
And it won't play unless you upgrade your system.

546
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:54,180
But because it tricks it, now you can play it.

547
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:59,900
And you can do this through just version 1 all the way to 2.

548
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:05,460
And what's also interesting is actually they're working on it right now because they want

549
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,700
to be perfect on it.

550
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:12,480
They have a way to revert those systems that actually are 152 and 151 to revert them back

551
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,480
to 15.

552
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:14,660
So they'll play homebrew stuff.

553
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:20,060
So if you haven't upgraded yours to 2.0 yet and you're not 1.5.

554
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:23,740
Why don't they just work on getting the homebrew stuff to work with 2.0 because I kind of want

555
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:31,440
They have 2.0, they changed all their encryption the way they do it, so it's a little tougher,

556
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,080
but pretty soon it's not going to matter.

557
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:39,880
They can revert those 1.5.2.1's back to 1.5.

558
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,520
Next step, 2.0's to 1.5.

559
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,320
It's a matter of time, so I don't know, we'll see.

560
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:48,120
But that's what they've got going on right now.

561
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:53,520
Other than that, just the same homebrew stuff, made a minesweeper game, it's kind of cool

562
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:57,280
But um yeah, it's pretty much all that's going on. All right. Uh

563
00:34:58,320 --> 00:35:01,600
Let's get to some housekeeping stuff. Let's start it off with a mailbag. Shall we?

564
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:06,520
Of course if you want to send us an email you can always drop us a line. It's to go

565
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:13,500
TOGO at orange lounge radio.com to send us an email. We got just two emails this week

566
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:16,580
I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on emails tonight because we spent enough time

567
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:21,980
Talking about stuff, but we did get a couple good emails and we want to read this certainly

568
00:35:21,980 --> 00:35:27,160
This one is a difference of opinion type issue. This one comes to us from Ed M

569
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:33,800
Sent us this email here says I really enjoy the shows and congrats on the pod show awards

570
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,560
Actually, I don't think did we win something pod show? I don't think that was a podcast

571
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:43,480
Yeah, the podcast award if if we did win something pod show that's news to me. Hey, cool

572
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:48,460
No, I think pod show is Adam Curry's side. I I get lost in all that podcasting

573
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,700
So, you know, I'm just I'm just here to talk about games

574
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,640
games. We win a couple awards while we're at it, cool. But no, that's alright. We know

575
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,880
it gets confusing. Here's the real part of the letter we want to read. You guys really

576
00:35:58,880 --> 00:36:02,760
need to lay off parents and how they raise their children. I am a parent with two adolescent

577
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:07,600
boys who is also a gamer and have been since I was in junior high. You guys on the other

578
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:11,720
hand are not parents and really have no clue about it. Yet you profess to have it all worked

579
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:16,160
out. Allow me to be the first to tell you that you forget about it everything you think

580
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:23,960
will change. Even if I have read and signed your proposed disclaimer, it still would not

581
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,840
have protected my children from the Easter egg in San Andreas had I purchased that for

582
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:32,160
my sons. In your infinite wisdom you have not addressed how to protect the consumers

583
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:37,200
from the game developers that you continue to defend that lie their asses off. Rockstar

584
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:41,600
lied about the hows and whys of that particular programming gem. The game developers have

585
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:45,380
every right to put into their games whatever they want but if I ask I also

586
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:49,700
have the right to be told the truth they share in the responsibility let me

587
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,620
finish this mail then we'll respond here games reviews news and like is your

588
00:36:53,620 --> 00:36:57,900
shtick trying to explain to people how to be parents is not stick to what you

589
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:02,700
know and leave parenting to the parents in the audience burn no actually um Dark

590
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:06,020
Sakura wrote him back and you know they have they have a nice conversation going

591
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,460
on but we do want to address his email the rest of us want to respond to that

592
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:14,940
Let me start so he does say that Rockstar lied about the hows and why of

593
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,140
the particular programming gem of course the hot coffee mod going back a couple

594
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,100
months ago to that news there. I do think that there was and I said this a couple

595
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:27,860
months ago in this the story first came out I do think when Rockstar put this

596
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:33,380
game out they never intended that mod to be seen I do think they put it in the

597
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:38,420
game on purpose but somewhere in the testing process they intended to take it

598
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:44,500
out. As I've mentioned on a previous show, I think a pointer, of course if you design

599
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:48,380
a game you have a flow chart, right? Basically a ginormous flow chart that works your way

600
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:54,020
through the game. Whatever led from point, you know, the game to the hot coffee part,

601
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:59,660
that pointer was taken out. So in Rockstar's eyes, there was no possible way, there was

602
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:04,600
no up, up, down, down, left, right code that was going to let you access that. It was out

603
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:10,840
of the game. A very similar parallel would be Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, no there's

604
00:38:10,840 --> 00:38:15,700
no Hot Coffee mod in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, but there is a song, Memories is

605
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:21,640
the song, Konami took this song out of the game at the last minute. Why? I don't know.

606
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:26,360
But instead of taking the game, the song out, all the data's on the disc, but some hackers

607
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:31,760
found out that if you turn a certain hexadecimal point on, or whatever, hack your card data,

608
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,000
can access the song it's like you're putting the pointer back in on the flow

609
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:39,200
chart that's what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas I'm almost

610
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,520
positive this is what happened is that that pointer that was intended to get

611
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:47,120
taken out got put back in and of course with a huge company like Rockstar you

612
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:49,800
probably have the programmers that knew that was in there but they had thought

613
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:55,000
they had taken it out and didn't realize that some kid was going to figure out

614
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:59,880
how to put it back in so whose fault is this in this case I don't know but

615
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,880
But here's what I do know.

616
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:04,320
Programmers will be taking the extra effort from now on

617
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,120
instead of simply taking a pointer out.

618
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:08,000
They're gonna go back and recompile all the data

619
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,680
and these games will be pushed back a couple of months

620
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,840
while they rebuild the code from the ground up

621
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,160
to ensure that this crap is no longer in the games

622
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:16,560
when it's not intended to be.

623
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:19,720
Because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has set the bar

624
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:23,720
at that now, that you can no longer leave this stuff

625
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,800
that you do not want accessed on the disc

626
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:28,360
because people will find it and they will play it.

627
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,200
and as you can see what happened here.

628
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:32,860
Now, in regards to the portion of the email

629
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:35,840
that talks about the person being a parent with kids

630
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,940
and also being a gamer, I'm gonna guess if you're a gamer,

631
00:39:39,940 --> 00:39:43,640
you know what is and isn't appropriate for your kids.

632
00:39:43,640 --> 00:39:47,100
So when we go off on parents or what have you,

633
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:51,160
please don't assume you, sir, are a part of these people.

634
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:54,080
Unfortunately, there are many, many out there

635
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,800
educated parents, and you're right,

636
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,840
I may not be a parent myself, but I see it.

637
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,880
I see these parents that are going into the stores

638
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,460
and they're letting their kids boss them around

639
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:06,760
and the kids are the ones picking up the game

640
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:09,240
and they don't seem to be,

641
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,820
the people, the parents that are buying the game

642
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,880
are absolutely clueless, this is stuff that's in there.

643
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,280
I have watched a kid pick up Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

644
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,440
and the parent just goes,

645
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:19,800
is that something you should be playing?

646
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,600
And the kid goes, yeah, it's fine.

647
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,060
And the parent goes, okay, son.

648
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:25,380
You know, and it's just kinda like,

649
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:28,900
don't have to be a parent to recognize there's something not going there's

650
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:33,020
something not right there you know if it was a movie if the movie was rated R the

651
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:37,340
parent want to know why it's rated R and you know certainly I envision that one

652
00:40:37,340 --> 00:40:41,900
day I may have children and I have ideas on how to raise them so do I necessarily

653
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:47,020
have kids myself and you know have these first-person experiences no and am I

654
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:51,420
gonna be the perfect parent no because some other freakin probably if I do have

655
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,940
kids a friend could always expose my kid to the games I don't want him to see and

656
00:40:56,940 --> 00:41:01,460
that's just something we've got to deal with and I say that we talk to our kids

657
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:04,740
about what is and isn't appropriate in games because just like you would talk

658
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:09,820
to them about you know sex and you know our rated things talk to them about it

659
00:41:09,820 --> 00:41:15,020
drugs all that stuff and that's the best way is to be a part of your kids life

660
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,740
and I don't think I have to be a parent to necessarily know that I hope I don't

661
00:41:19,740 --> 00:41:20,860
I don't know, that's just my views.

662
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,700
Loki?

663
00:41:21,700 --> 00:41:23,700
Well, games have ratings on them, just like movies

664
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:24,540
have ratings on them.

665
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,580
Say, for instance, you go see Ken Park,

666
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:32,220
which has hardcore sex in it with teenagers.

667
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:34,020
If your kids go and see that, and then they

668
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:37,140
start going having sex, and they get pregnant,

669
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:39,540
don't come crying to me because your kids are pregnant,

670
00:41:39,540 --> 00:41:42,220
because you made the bad decision to let them play it.

671
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,500
Same with the game.

672
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:46,820
That game is rated M, meaning anybody above 17

673
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:49,360
should be able to play it, not below 17.

674
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:53,560
So, if you think it's okay for your kids to play it, don't go trying to sue Rockstar because

675
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:59,200
they're shooting up their school or don't go trying to say, oh they're forever ruined.

676
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:02,680
You know what, you made the decision, it may have been a bad decision, but you gotta live

677
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:03,680
with it.

678
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,760
That's basically what it is.

679
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:09,520
So really the people we're talking to are like dumb grandma who doesn't know anything

680
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:15,760
and she is suing Rockstar because little Billy saw some polygon boob.

681
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:21,540
You know what little Billy shouldn't have been playing the game and grandma should have you know, listen to the stupid little thing

682
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:26,480
That's on every single game the ratings that are on there. That's why they put them on their own put it on there

683
00:42:26,480 --> 00:42:27,440
Just for the hell of it

684
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:29,320
So, you know what?

685
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:35,340
Those are the people that the people that want to put the responsibility on the game publishers the ones that are saying

686
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:43,160
Oh, well, I didn't know that this this game says no over 18. I thought that my son was okay because he 13

687
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:55,200
We certainly are okay with the disagreement and opinion, that's cool, and we encourage

688
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,000
if you guys have another email, send it on over to go at orangeonstrader.com, anybody

689
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:00,240
that wants to say something.

690
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,240
Or of course, because we can only read so many emails a show, we do have the forums

691
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,220
as well, and I'm going to be talking about that in a minute during some housekeeping.

692
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,860
Let's get to our second email tonight.

693
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:11,560
This is from rlove, is the name of the person that sent this.

694
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:17,560
like that name our love sounds like a late night DJ on a AM station our love

695
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:20,920
wanted to ask I just wanted to ask if you've heard anything about whether or

696
00:43:20,920 --> 00:43:24,920
not the current logitech wireless controllers will be able to be used on

697
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:30,280
ps3 and Xbox 360 by the way josh sweden is writing and directing Wonder Woman

698
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:33,520
I'm not sure what I would be more worried about how bad the movie will be

699
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:38,200
or how crappy the obviously forthcoming game based on it will be it just proves

700
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:42,560
once again Hollywood's total lack of creativity. On the plus side, there has to be a Linda

701
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:46,360
Carter cameo in it. Anything else is sacrilege. That, of course, related to the Wonder Woman

702
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,080
story I mentioned last week. Or was it two weeks ago? I don't remember.

703
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,760
By the way, I read Ooey Bowl, had an interview on 1up.com this week, and he thinks that his

704
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:59,820
movies are good. Whoa! There's someone who has no grasp of reality

705
00:43:59,820 --> 00:44:03,760
right there. Yes, I did hear about Joss Whedon doing the

706
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,840
Wonder Woman movie or Buffy the lasso Slayer. No, I don't know. Uh, no, I liked Buffy the show

707
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:14,940
I'm not hardcore about like my roommate. Just you guys know my roommate is hardcore Buffy angel fan. He hard fucking core

708
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:19,260
DVDs for the record. He has the Buffy soundtrack right here on his computer desk

709
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,620
Don't tell extra for this but he listens to the music in his car and everything and I even know the songs not that there's

710
00:44:26,620 --> 00:44:31,360
Anything wrong with that. I like Buffy, but I mean he's hardcore. I'm sure the movie is gonna be cool

711
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:36,640
I think serenity looks pretty cool. That's a Joss Whedon thing too. Okay. He looks pretty badass, so we'll see

712
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:43,820
Who knows can't really say until we start seeing some actual footage from the movie, but Joss Whedon does have that little sense of humor

713
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,400
That's the one thing I did like about Buffy is it was very tongue-in-cheek

714
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,960
So you know if the Wonder Woman movie it could it could benefit from that

715
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:56,040
Here's the other part of the letter of course the Logitech wireless controllers being able to be used on ps3 and Xbox 360

716
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:01,720
I would guess no because PS3's really changed their controller from the ground up

717
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:04,200
It looks I mean the the boomerang style controller now

718
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:11,280
I just think and especially now that aren't they going bluetooth as well the I don't even know I have a feeling they are

719
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:15,600
Don't count on it. We don't know for sure our love, but don't count on it sadly

720
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:19,280
I don't think the wireless is gonna let me put this way what here's what's gonna happen

721
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,000
There's gonna be a third party guy out there that makes a controller

722
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:27,400
that's gonna basically be able to plug in you know to some adapter or whatever

723
00:45:27,400 --> 00:45:31,120
and that'll be Bluetooth to whatever so you'll be able to use your Logitech

724
00:45:31,120 --> 00:45:35,320
wireless controller with massive lag because that's what's gonna happen you

725
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:38,440
know what sadly I think you're just gonna have to upgrade your controller to

726
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:42,240
one of the new wireless controllers but you know don't quote me on it I'm not on

727
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,320
the inside I don't know for sure but I would just think because of the drastic

728
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:50,520
change that both controllers are going through physically I just I don't see it

729
00:45:50,520 --> 00:45:56,840
happening. Yeah, that does suck because I like using my DualShock PS1 controllers with

730
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,780
my PlayStation 2 because I was a cheap bastard. I know the Xbox 360 one can't work because

731
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,700
they added an extra button. They added the media center button. So I just don't see it

732
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:13,700
working. The Xbox 360 button is useless. It is. But it's there. The ring of light. It's

733
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:19,540
just a button. Alright, again if you want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O at orangelaundrydo.com.

734
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:22,860
Square Enix and Namco announced their lineup for the Tokyo Game Show.

735
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:27,460
Namco is going to be showing Tales of the Abyss, Soulcalibur III, Critical Velocity,

736
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:33,340
MotoGP4, and Urban Reign for the PS2, Ridge Racer 6, and Frame City Killer for the Xbox

737
00:46:33,340 --> 00:46:38,780
360, and some other games including Tales of Eternia online for the PC.

738
00:46:38,780 --> 00:46:43,140
Squeenix will be showing Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebras, Kingdom Hearts II, Code

739
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:50,420
Age Commanders for the PS2 and on PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox 360 Final Fantasy 11 as to

740
00:46:50,420 --> 00:46:54,940
what capacity they will be showing Final Fantasy 11 on 360, don't know yet.

741
00:46:54,940 --> 00:46:58,620
For all those waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2 to be coming out in October, guess what, it's

742
00:46:58,620 --> 00:46:59,620
coming out next year.

743
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:00,620
Really?

744
00:47:00,620 --> 00:47:01,620
When did you find that out?

745
00:47:01,620 --> 00:47:03,980
I found that out from the Square Enix guy.

746
00:47:03,980 --> 00:47:05,800
I didn't even hear that announced.

747
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:07,740
It's not coming out until next year.

748
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:10,360
It got pushed out of this year.

749
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:13,400
The big one coming out this year from Square Enix, Dragon Quest VIII.

750
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:17,000
That's going to be the big one, but Kingdom Hearts, they win, buh-bye.

751
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,120
Oh, I did not know that.

752
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:20,120
That's news to me.

753
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:21,120
Yep, next year.

754
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:22,120
Interesting, okay.

755
00:47:22,120 --> 00:47:25,720
What I also thought was interesting is Square Enix is going to be showing EverQuest II because

756
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:30,740
I guess they have the distribution rights overseas to that one, which I think is interesting.

757
00:47:30,740 --> 00:47:31,740
Notice what's missing.

758
00:47:31,740 --> 00:47:38,160
Front Mission 5 and, hello, Final Fantasy XII, missing from the showing list at Tokyo

759
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,160
Game Show.

760
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:42,480
I hope they...

761
00:47:42,480 --> 00:47:45,720
Man, don't you start to worry that the game's just going to get called off.

762
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:49,880
I'd be so mad. Because the E3 demo a year and a half ago was so pretty.

763
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:53,760
You know, I'm saying at this point it's probably going to be next-gen. It's gotta be.

764
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:56,880
I mean, think about it, I'm probably like, ehhhhh, fine.

765
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:00,160
I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

766
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,280
Extreme Ghouls and Ghosts coming out for the PSP.

767
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:08,080
That is confirmed by Famitsu Magazine. Of course,

768
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,640
this uh... being based on the ghouls and ghosts series which dates back to the

769
00:48:11,640 --> 00:48:12,440
eighties

770
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:16,080
uh... it was reinvented on the PS2 etcetera etcetera

771
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:17,080
uh...

772
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:20,840
the PSP version will have like branching paths

773
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,880
as determined by certain warp points

774
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:27,040
uh... each path having its own treasure so you can replay certain levels so you

775
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:27,460
know just

776
00:48:27,460 --> 00:48:30,240
trying to add something a little new to the game I guess but

777
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:33,760
Ghouls and Ghosts good game although it's been redone about a gazillion times but

778
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:37,760
I'm still very loyal to the old Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts

779
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,360
so we'll see how the PSP one turns out a little later when this game comes out

780
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,400
I guess next year I don't really see a date for this one so

781
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:50,160
we'll see. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight, some various

782
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:52,400
housekeeping news on tonight's podcast

783
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:56,400
first off we've made some changes to the website just little little changes

784
00:48:56,400 --> 00:49:00,000
our forums we've actually restructured them so we have a forum

785
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,800
strictly for podcast talk now so if you have some feedback you want to talk

786
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:05,520
about something we talked on the podcast

787
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:08,940
one of our stories, perhaps further discussion on Hot Coffee Mod,

788
00:49:08,940 --> 00:49:12,980
we encourage you to go to our forums, www.orangeonsradio.com. We have a brand new

789
00:49:12,980 --> 00:49:16,220
Orange on the Radio podcast forum. We're just trying to breathe some life into our forums

790
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:16,500
because

791
00:49:16,500 --> 00:49:19,900
freaking nobody posts there, so we may have to do a giveaway or something to a

792
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:24,060
random post to try and get incentive, because we like it when people post there.

793
00:49:24,060 --> 00:49:27,800
It gives me something to read at work when I should be working, as I'm sure a lot of you

794
00:49:27,800 --> 00:49:28,900
feel about it.

795
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:32,140
Also, we're going to be adding to our page a links

796
00:49:32,140 --> 00:49:35,300
section that will be specific for each podcast.

797
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:37,860
So some popular links that we talk about,

798
00:49:37,860 --> 00:49:39,140
because a lot of folks have been complaining,

799
00:49:39,140 --> 00:49:41,100
well, you read these links and they're huge,

800
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:42,500
and we have no way to find these sites.

801
00:49:42,500 --> 00:49:44,360
So we're gonna add a links section

802
00:49:44,360 --> 00:49:46,380
that we can index the links by podcast.

803
00:49:46,380 --> 00:49:48,340
And I actually wanna give you a couple links

804
00:49:48,340 --> 00:49:50,820
that have to do with some show things.

805
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:52,380
First one is one of our listeners.

806
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:54,780
One of our listeners, the guy that goes by DJ Ranma S,

807
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,060
who lives out on the East Coast,

808
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:58,480
he actually has a really creative idea

809
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:00,140
for Hurricane Katrina relief.

810
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:03,460
And of course, Hurricane Katrina was a huge impact

811
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,500
this past week and we know we had some very close listeners,

812
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,540
some long time fans of Orange Launch Radio

813
00:50:08,540 --> 00:50:12,860
dating back to, when did we start this thing, 2002?

814
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,260
Back to 2002 when we first started with the live station,

815
00:50:15,260 --> 00:50:16,920
we're affected and lost everything.

816
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:20,520
And we just, it's so horrible to hear about

817
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,780
and I don't want to get into,

818
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:23,360
I don't want to get into grim details

819
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,820
because you're here to hear about video games.

820
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:28,700
But I think what DJ Rama S is doing is really cool.

821
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,000
as you guys know, I'm sure you've seen on many of the popular websites, you can donate

822
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,780
to the Red Cross, but maybe you're thinking, gosh, I don't really have money to give to

823
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:41,260
the Red Cross. Well, DJ Rama S is actually really big in the cosplay community, so he

824
00:50:41,260 --> 00:50:46,400
thought, well, what do we do in the cosplay community? We're constantly taking clothes

825
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,300
and remaking clothes, and therefore we go through a lot of old clothes. So why don't

826
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,100
we gather up old clothes and give them to Salvation Army, because, you know, these people,

827
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:57,960
some of them are without the bare essentials right now. So I like this idea, he's calling

828
00:50:57,960 --> 00:51:02,880
at Project Relief and they're trying to collect clothes and just anything you want to give

829
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:07,300
at various sites. They're doing this a lot on the East Coast but they're trying to organize

830
00:51:07,300 --> 00:51:13,200
collection spots throughout the country. Check it out. It's djrondmas.net slash html slash

831
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:17,520
project underscore relief dot html. We will of course put a link. I know, see that's such

832
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:20,960
a huge link. We're going to put a link on orangelaundry.com so you guys can check that

833
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:26,160
out. So thank you Rond Masse for putting that together and we'll see what we can put together

834
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:30,300
is a donation for that I think that's a great idea also I this is one of those

835
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:34,140
things I should have mentioned last week on the show but there's an independent

836
00:51:34,140 --> 00:51:37,820
record label that actually started up in the Sacramento area and they do kind of

837
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:43,820
goth industrial style music which if you're into UltraMix 2 or DDR UltraMix 3

838
00:51:43,820 --> 00:51:48,420
lately seems to be having quite a bit of that and actually the administrator of

839
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:55,220
the DDR freaks forums iguana girl is actually throwing her hat into the ring

840
00:51:55,220 --> 00:51:58,840
of this company and we've actually been kind of cross-promoting each other a little bit

841
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:03,140
so I wanted to give them a shout out. They just released a brand new CD called Blood

842
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:07,580
and Synth, a compilation. It's the first CD on the label and it just came out this past

843
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:16,900
week. Check out their site, www.darkrecordsnclothing.com. Not and, but the letter N. Darkrecordsnclothing.com.

844
00:52:16,900 --> 00:52:19,620
So good luck to those guys. Support independent music, guys.

845
00:52:19,620 --> 00:52:24,780
Funny enough, I was just talking to my friend earlier today who lives up around this area

846
00:52:24,780 --> 00:52:30,100
he had mentioned like a co-worker being a DJ and saying yeah his name's DJ

847
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:34,500
illogical beats and he has this thing coming out with the blood and synth I'm

848
00:52:34,500 --> 00:52:37,700
like I read that on a friend's live journal on the guana girls actually no

849
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:41,860
less and I was like wow man this world just gets smaller and smaller amazing

850
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:48,340
yeah he's a co-worker of his Wow that's very cool and right heaven bacon man all

851
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,000
right check that out you guys we definitely want to support the

852
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,740
independent record labels and especially the ones have been supporting us so

853
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:56,420
So check that out.

854
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:58,820
All right, let's go into some more news tonight here

855
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,680
to wrap up tonight's show.

856
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:05,680
Metal Slug 6 is coming out on SNK Playmore.

857
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:07,960
I'm sorry is the name of the company now.

858
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:10,740
They showed this off at the 43rd Amusement Machine Show

859
00:53:10,740 --> 00:53:12,140
which happened in Tokyo.

860
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,580
Although it was actually at Sega's booth.

861
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,680
It's the seventh installment in the Metal Slug series

862
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:21,260
because of Metal Slug X.

863
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:24,340
and uh... it's being developed for sammy's

864
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:27,500
a thomas wave platform which would of course be

865
00:53:27,500 --> 00:53:30,780
a little bit different than the neo geo arcade system you used to so this is a

866
00:53:30,780 --> 00:53:33,940
new arcade game that's coming out

867
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:37,700
metal metal slug six i know there's a lot of metal slugs fans out there so i

868
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:38,540
just thought i'd

869
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:42,340
kinda tip my hat at that game let me just say whoop-de-doo

870
00:53:42,340 --> 00:53:45,860
hey last metal slug games have been all the same

871
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:50,740
except for metal slug 3d which was interesting i don't know if that ever even came out

872
00:53:50,740 --> 00:53:53,580
You know what I did see though, that they were showing at, I think it was at Tokyo Game

873
00:53:53,580 --> 00:53:56,920
Show actually, um, Mario Kart, um...

874
00:53:56,920 --> 00:54:00,440
Tokyo Game Show hasn't happened yet, so, are you thinking, oh, you're thinking of the amusement

875
00:54:00,440 --> 00:54:03,420
show, the amusement show, whatever, the one that Street Fighter IV was supposed to be

876
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:04,420
at and didn't happen?

877
00:54:04,420 --> 00:54:05,420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

878
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:07,340
Uh, they showed the new Mario Kart arcade game.

879
00:54:07,340 --> 00:54:08,340
Hot!

880
00:54:08,340 --> 00:54:09,340
Oh yeah, hot!

881
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:11,260
Oh yeah, that's some good stuff right there.

882
00:54:11,260 --> 00:54:12,260
Can't wait.

883
00:54:12,260 --> 00:54:13,260
Anyways.

884
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:18,660
Sweet Codin' 5 is on its way, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Tokyo

885
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:22,960
game show September 16th through 18th Suikoden 5 taking place in the

886
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:28,500
queendom of Felina a kingdom which was referred to a few times in the previous

887
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:33,800
games don't know quite about the time frame Suikoden 5 but I hear it's gonna

888
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,520
be pretty good I hear if you were disappointed by Suikoden 4 Suikoden 5

889
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,680
will make things better that of course coming out for the PlayStation 2 it will

890
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,980
not be a next-gen game it's gonna be PlayStation 2 you also have to figure

891
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:47,240
that Suikoden Tactics is going to be in there somewhere right so Suikoden

892
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:53,540
big thing for Konami right now, unlock all those million characters that are in the game.

893
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:56,700
Advent Children, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is going to be getting its own title

894
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:02,100
song. Of course, title songs being a big thing in Square Games, you know, Simple and Clean,

895
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:06,620
Eyes on Me, you know. Advent Children, even though it's not a game, it's a movie, has

896
00:55:06,620 --> 00:55:13,420
its own song. Kyusuke Himiro with Calling, but the weird thing is, it's actually from

897
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:21,420
his 1989 album Neofasiko, but that's the theme song and supposedly says the Advent

898
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,620
Children director Tetsuya Nomura for the setting of Advent Children it's very

899
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:31,900
fitting so an old 80s classic may his way I got another email the other day

900
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:39,420
saying it's gonna be November 30th or 29th so November 29th like I said before

901
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:44,500
interesting son of a bitch they pushed it back but you know was the soundtrack

902
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:49,020
supposedly being released September 28th well good for them you know but all I'm

903
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:53,780
hoping is a man all I'm hoping is to see a copy well it's linked to the internet

904
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:58,980
which will be like the day of or the day after so all right for those you guys

905
00:55:58,980 --> 00:56:04,900
that were kind of ticked off at Xbox 360s you know dual level pricing thing

906
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:10,380
going on. PlayStation 3 would just like you to know, well at least on British website

907
00:56:10,380 --> 00:56:18,180
gamesindustry.biz, sorry, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Vice President Phil Harrison said doing

908
00:56:18,180 --> 00:56:23,740
that multiple pricing level for PlayStation 3? Unlikely. So you don't have to worry about

909
00:56:23,740 --> 00:56:27,380
this. You'll just be shelling out 500 bucks for the PlayStation 3 to start. No, I'm kidding.

910
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:31,900
I'm kidding. I don't know. I don't know. Well, let me just put it this way. It's not going

911
00:56:31,900 --> 00:56:33,180
to be cheap

912
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:37,100
uh... also says phil harrison are there two versions of the xbox three sixty

913
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:38,980
that people want to buy i don't know

914
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:42,500
i look at those formats i think it just confuses the audience

915
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,900
they don't know which one to buy developers don't know which one to

916
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,440
create for and retailers don't know which one to stock

917
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:52,660
so i think we would take that strategy we wouldn't want to create. They made some huge

918
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:55,140
mistakes doing the double skews on those

919
00:56:55,140 --> 00:56:59,160
uh... first one being is now there's no guarantee that there's going to be a hard drive in there

920
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:00,700
Developers can't develop their games

921
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:02,620
with hard drive support.

922
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,380
The other thing that they made a mistake on

923
00:57:04,380 --> 00:57:06,540
is that there's only a DVD drive in there,

924
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:08,520
not like any next-gen format.

925
00:57:09,700 --> 00:57:13,700
They're running out of space on the DVDs to put the games.

926
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:16,460
They're gonna run into a lot of hurdles with this thing,

927
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:18,700
and it's not looking good.

928
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:19,860
We'll see, we'll see.

929
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,060
King of Fighters just came out this week for the Xbox.

930
00:57:24,060 --> 00:57:26,620
Just kinda wanted to tip our hat at that one.

931
00:57:26,620 --> 00:57:30,300
2002 and 2003 editions coming out for the Xbox.

932
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,840
By the way, it was actually already released

933
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:35,140
for the PlayStation 2, but this has Xbox Live support.

934
00:57:35,140 --> 00:57:38,580
So, for those of you guys that are into King of Fart,

935
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:40,160
did I say King of Farters?

936
00:57:40,160 --> 00:57:41,520
Sorry, King of Farters?

937
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:45,300
Yeah, we're definitely running late here on the show.

938
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:49,940
Sony, possibly also, by the way,

939
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,580
something that was said by Phil Harrison,

940
00:57:51,580 --> 00:57:53,080
boy, this guy's got a big mouth lately,

941
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:54,740
but that's good, we like guys with big mouths,

942
00:57:54,740 --> 00:57:57,900
because it gives us a hint to what these companies are thinking.

943
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:03,740
Possibly charging for PSP downloads in 2006.

944
00:58:03,740 --> 00:58:09,860
Saying that possibly Wipeout Pure was kind of like a test case for something that could

945
00:58:09,860 --> 00:58:10,860
be coming in the future.

946
00:58:10,860 --> 00:58:15,180
He says, it's an experiment which has turned out to be a good experiment.

947
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:17,980
That quote coming from UK's Edge magazine.

948
00:58:17,980 --> 00:58:18,980
No.

949
00:58:18,980 --> 00:58:19,980
What, Loki?

950
00:58:19,980 --> 00:58:20,980
You're saying no.

951
00:58:20,980 --> 00:58:21,980
No.

952
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:22,980
Why no?

953
00:58:22,980 --> 00:58:23,980
That's a dumb idea.

954
00:58:23,980 --> 00:58:30,200
Well let me put it this way, with Wipeout you could actually download, well for example

955
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:35,140
here's a perfect example, you can emulate basically make it look like that your web

956
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:39,020
browser is a PSP and download that program, oh hey look at there, there's a file that

957
00:58:39,020 --> 00:58:41,940
I can transfer to any PSP.

958
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,580
It's gonna be so freaking easy to pirate that stuff, it's not even funny.

959
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:48,420
I mean there's all the Wipeout downloads that are out there, you can get them from their

960
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,360
websites or you can get them from any other website that happens to be holding them.

961
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,880
So I don't know.

962
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:59,080
I know what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to work.

963
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:04,160
Last story tonight, the last story, Bungie, the folks behind Halo getting into the Hurricane

964
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,160
Katrina relief.

965
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:06,160
This is pretty cool.

966
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,840
They've created a custom t-shirt, and the custom t-shirt shows a little master chief,

967
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,160
and he looks like he's kind of kicking some hurricane butt there.

968
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:16,800
Like literally, I don't know what that's, it actually looks like a giant cotton ball

969
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:19,560
with teeth, but I think it's supposed to be a hurricane.

970
00:59:19,560 --> 00:59:23,280
it saying fight the flood and they're selling this little custom shirt trying

971
00:59:23,280 --> 00:59:26,800
to get you know gamers to show support they're saying that roughly fifteen

972
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:31,200
dollars of each shirt sold will go directly to the hurricane relief effort

973
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:35,840
so if you're interested in checking that out head on over to a bungee.net and

974
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:38,480
check that out we'll also of course provide a link to that on our new links

975
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:46,120
page so that's that the other thing about speaking a little bit about Xbox

976
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:52,960
here origin xbox or origin xbox 360 another viral site the countdown is gonna be done

977
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:58,360
on monday the 26th of this month so we'll know what that is apparently bunnies keep

978
00:59:58,360 --> 01:00:01,960
appearing disappearing i really don't give a crap about the bunnies and the tree and

979
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:07,280
the hole and whatever other crap that's on the tree i'm just hoping it's a release date

980
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:11,880
which they're saying is gonna be no later than black friday which if it's released on

981
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:18,040
Black Friday, in other words, the biggest shopping day of the year after Thanksgiving,

982
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,880
that's going to fucking suck.

983
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:25,840
All I know is I was smart this time and did not pre-book my system at the mall.

984
01:00:25,840 --> 01:00:31,200
I did a really small game stop that's nearby my house so I can go pick it up and leave.

985
01:00:31,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Sounds good.

986
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,560
Alright, wow, we broke an hour tonight, kids.

987
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,400
Our first podcast over an hour in length.

988
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,960
It's definitely time to wrap it up.

989
01:00:37,960 --> 01:00:39,240
We just have a lot to say.

990
01:00:39,240 --> 01:00:41,400
And plus, you know, we've been doing a little drinking, so we're rambling.

991
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:45,260
responsibly kids don't drink and drive I won't uh let's go around and get

992
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:48,580
everybody's final thoughts Mel B thank you for being here tonight appreciate

997
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:08,820
first two months of our live program way back in 2002 so so you know as we say in

998

Um, hopefully I'll be back for another show, you know be a podcaster live and of course, you know

1001
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,080
I'll probably be bringing in a couple more new CDs along

1002
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:30,960
Well, you didn't touch on that on the pod not on the podcast, but we did talk about it on

1003
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:34,560
Another program that we do for orange launch radio

1004
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:42,120
The new CDs by Zonk and Orifiz which are going to be actually part of

1005
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:45,780
UltraMix 3. Actually I'm not sure about Zonk's involvement in UltraMix 3 but

1006
01:01:45,780 --> 01:01:50,520
Orifiz being one of them. Yeah Orifiz is definitely a Basile. This song will be in

1007
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:55,360
UltraMix 3. I had talked to Dave who is the guy behind Orifiz and actually is

1008
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:58,720
also one of the musicians on Zonk and he said that they're looking into a

1009
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:03,960
possible download for a future song. I mean yeah I've gotten to hear them. I

1010
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,680
I actually got to see them in concert a couple times,

1011
01:02:06,680 --> 01:02:07,840
just in the past couple months.

1012
01:02:07,840 --> 01:02:09,680
They're actually gonna be taking a break from touring

1013
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:13,000
because the lead singer is actually having a baby.

1014
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,000
Oh, nice.

1015
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:14,840
Yeah.

1016
01:02:14,840 --> 01:02:15,660

guy which is awesome they were great we're actually supposed to go this is

1030
01:02:53,820 --> 01:02:58,700
funny we're supposed to go in with Daniel and Eric from Tomo or no not

1031
01:02:58,700 --> 01:03:04,080
Daniel. Tomo, we're the guy from Koei and the guy from H-Tech or Tomo, the guy at Basic

1032

Club that distributes them.

1033
01:03:05,700 --> 01:03:06,700
Ah, stop me.

1034
01:03:06,700 --> 01:03:11,180
Anyways, anyway, okay. We're supposed to go on white water rafting in the spring, which

1035
01:03:11,180 --> 01:03:18,100
is interesting. How's that for company relationships? But no, it was really fun. I enjoyed talking

1036
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:23,160
with them. I talked their ears off about their product and I'm glad that I had someone to

1037
01:03:23,160 --> 01:03:26,820
talk to who I actually understood what I was talking to. Well, hopefully they understood.

1038
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:33,240
It was just fun and really I got to learn a lot of stuff and make those connections

1039
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:38,820
that we really needed to make and hopefully Daniel at Konami is going to be sending me

1040
01:03:38,820 --> 01:03:44,020
those V-Rares for Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.

1041
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:46,820
And hopefully some of these companies will listen to your pleas for prizes that we're

1042
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:48,260
going to turn around to our listeners.

1043
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:50,700
Yeah, we plug a lot of the games out here.

1044
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:55,700
We talk about everything that comes out and everything and it's really cool and I love

1045
01:03:55,700 --> 01:03:59,100
playing everything out there I play whatever I get my hands on so

1046
01:03:59,100 --> 01:04:02,740
my final thought is we gotta wrap this stuff up

1047
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,380
