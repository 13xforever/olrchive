606	2967	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 12th, 2005.
30848	32448	My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
32489	36230	Joining me as always, my awesome co-host, say hello to the one and only, DarkSakura.
36950	37910	Uh, brains.
38570	39531	You sound like you're in a good mood.
39551	43172	Uh... Maybe been playing a little too much Resident Evil?
43512	44872	No, I've been playing with my puppies.
45512	47893	And I went to Dave and Buster's last night.
48293	48913	Fun, fun times.
48933	53215	You have to fill us in in just a minute here, but first let me introduce the one and only, Techmaster Loki.
53755	54095	I'm here.
54415	54795	How you doing?
55035	55335	I'm good.
55636	55796	Good.
56796	57076	All right.
57569	60511	Usually we like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week?
60531	61312	What have you been playing?
61332	62353	Let's get right into it.
63033	64394	DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?
64534	64895	Puppies.
66496	67136	Everyday puppies.
68077	68778	Have you been good about it?
68798	69939	Are you actually going in there everyday?
70239	74822	Yeah, and I walk my puppies and clean up their poopy and I make them catch frisbee and earn me money.
75103	77084	So I pimp out my puppies to the frisbee people.
77384	81608	Do you think the game is starting to get to the point of it's getting a little irritating having to go in everyday?
81748	81868	No.
82308	82428	No?
83029	84710	Because that's what some people are bitching about.
85106	85466	I'm hearing now.
85486	89309	Well, then they, you know, never had a virtual pet before.
89329	90470	Nintendogs was not for them.
91050	93292	They never carried around their pocket Pikachu, damn it.
95153	98456	I also played, went to Dave and Buster's last night and played Battletech for the first time.
98476	102719	Yeah, that game gave me a headache, made me want to throw up.
102799	104660	Now, describe Battletech for those that may not know.
104720	108863	You get in these pod things and basically it's like you're in the cockpit of a mech.
109844	110945	And you go around killing people.
112205	112786	I didn't like it.
114426	119489	It's one of those games where the screen's up on top and it reflects onto a concave mirror.
121089	124931	It totally messed with my sense of motion sickness.
125991	126392	I played...
127672	133779	Lange and the Midnight Maximum tune last night and completely owned my husband.
134680	135621	So weird saying that.
135881	136642	Your husband!
136662	140046	I've been married 10 days and I still have trouble writing my last name.
140727	141988	I haven't been to the DMV yet either.
142008	142629	Um...
145752	154881	I also played a bunch of Tiki games and that was really... Dave Buster's the one place where playing Tiki games can be cool, not like Chuck E. Cheese.
154901	158725	Yeah, I was trying to save up enough to get new mugs, but they didn't have any mugs, so I just saved my tickets.
159806	163830	I had enough to purchase an Xbox game or a PS2 game, but I just, I didn't.
165414	173496	I thought about getting that racing game that Rockstar puts out, the Midnight Club 3 Dub Edition.
173776	175657	If you want to play that, I've got it, I think.
176017	177217	Maybe I'll borrow it and check it out.
177477	178597	I need a good racing game.
179078	180998	Now that I've given you back your copy of Silent Hill 4.
181138	181418	Awesome.
182458	183179	I need to play through that.
184979	185879	Anyway, anything else?
186980	187320	Puppies!
187860	187960	Loki!
189827	193189	So I've been playing Burnout 3, as per usual.
193869	198772	And then I got a copy of Burnout Legends for the PSP, so I've been playing that.
199293	204476	Just to tide me over until I get Burnout Revenge this week, which I have on pre-order and already paid for.
205116	206317	And that one's going to be awesome.
206737	207918	And Burnout Legends is cool.
207938	213441	It's kind of all three games of the original three put together, plus bonus stuff.
214161	215122	And I love it.
215802	218404	God, you haven't shut up about this Burnout game for like two months already.
219033	221976	And then other things I've been playing.
222036	224158	Nintendogs, of course, I have to take care of Taco.
225459	227701	Which I do find it a little annoying.
227882	231085	Just because he's always hungry, no matter how often I check on him.
231105	234408	It's like, damn, my dog never got that hungry.
234688	239032	I mean, why can't you just leave the bowl out for him to eat the damn food and just leave it there?
239052	239593	I mean...
240106	242166	My dog never went through a bowl of water that quick.
242246	243287	I mean, what the hell?
243587	244387	Water should be free.
244427	245827	Why the hell do I have to buy water?
245987	247687	Because your puppies need special water.
248068	248308	Oh, fuck them.
248328	249628	That you buy at the dog store.
250168	251828	Stupid special water.
251908	255629	You have to walk to the discount store and get it for, you know, uber cheap.
255669	258249	Why isn't there a store where you have to buy toys?
258289	260410	You have to find used toys in the street.
260610	262330	I mean, isn't that a little weird?
262770	263731	I sell that crap.
264991	266071	My friend got a Dalmatian.
267011	267411	That's cool.
267431	269272	Yeah, I heard Dalmatians were unlockable in it.
269292	270752	She found the fireman hat.
271052	271452	Lucky.
271853	272893	Got a Dalmatian named Lala.
272913	273773	Just in the street somewhere?
274693	274994	Lana.
275834	281636	She found the... You have to... If you walk around the top perimeter, then you get more rare stuff.
282436	282996	Oh, interesting.
283556	285157	The further away you go from home, the better stuff you get.
285177	289938	And what the hell are those packages that... I'll be walking and all of a sudden there's a box sitting on the ground.
289958	292619	You have to shake your leash over it and your dog, you will notice it.
292819	294980	Pull your dog back and he'll grab it and open it.
296027	296888	Use the leash to pull back.
296968	298449	I was shaking the hell out of my dog.
298469	302291	You would have thought that I was trying to kill it or something, and the fucker wouldn't pick up the package.
302572	303893	I've got two dogs that I have.
304193	309877	I'm a Welsh Corgi, and I have Menchie, who's a Shiba Inu, and I didn't realize I have anime dogs now, both of them.
310457	312739	And they're both like fish sticks from the trash can.
313479	317162	I have Oscar, my wiener dog, who has a Mario hat now, by the way, which I found in the street.
317942	324727	I have Taco, who has a spike collar, a news hat, and some sunglasses.
325450	327051	I have the Japanese style collar on Minji.
327071	327272	Takara.
353685	361067	It's like you can do fights against... It's basically like Super Smash Bros., but you can play as Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime.
361147	361967	I mean, come on.
361987	362267	That's crazy.
362287	362947	That's rad.
362987	365647	And Optimus Prime turns into a truck and runs over people.
365707	366428	I find it funny.
366628	369908	Well, Takara is actually... Takara is a toy maker.
370949	376670	And they're the ones who put out Transformers and, like, Lika-chan, the little Barbie doll in Japan.
376690	377230	Yep, she's in it.
377530	378430	Yeah, Lika-chan's in it.
379835	381937	And then Master Higgins from Adventure Island.
382417	384739	I hear Bonk is unlockable, so it's pretty cool.
384839	385820	It's great.
385840	386641	But it's not a new game.
386681	387421	It's been out a little while, right?
387441	390084	It's been out for a couple years, but it's just really weird.
391625	394527	Sometimes we discover these little import gems a little late.
395488	395808	I know.
396269	399731	Hey, well, you know, we're not in Japan, so we can't do the stuff advertised right away.
399792	400692	So, hey, whatever.
400772	401313	It's still good.
402694	406177	And then, of course, I'm putting more money down on my 360, so waiting for that.
407017	408138	So, lots of stuff.
408419	408759	Sounds good.
409159	413241	On GameStop's site, they have a $1,000 Ultimate Bundle.
413761	415361	I think we talked about that the week you were here.
415501	416342	Yeah, it was crazy.
417082	423544	We were talking to the game publishers about that and they were laughing at how ridiculous and stupid it is because most of those games aren't coming out at launch.
424165	427226	I don't know how they're going to get this stuff, but it's not coming out at launch.
427806	427986	Ouch.
428931	430433	I want to think about that before we pre-order.
430473	432375	The games get delayed all the time.
432395	436179	Who is going to pay thousands of dollars for some stew for every game?
436339	437700	Just buy them as they come out.
438121	440884	Oh my god, I'm not interested in that one.
440924	442505	Like I said, rich people.
442746	443426	Rich people don't care.
444227	445368	Paris Hilton, she doesn't care.
445508	446169	She just wants her Xbox.
446189	447791	She doesn't know how to freaking use an Xbox.
448892	449252	Anyway.
449633	450514	She can make sausage.
451112	453595	Moving on, my gaming week.
454295	455997	I played mostly games that are kind of old.
456117	462443	Speaking of rediscovering old games, I bought .hack a couple weeks ago and I finally like really beginning into it this week and just playing through it.
463504	464706	It's really a cool little game.
465126	466347	I like the story.
466467	469490	I like the idea of an MMO, but it's not.
470691	471451	I don't know, it's kind of neat.
488413	489034	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
509321	511822	This is seriously one of the greatest GameCube games they put out.
513043	515424	Not just that, it's one of the greatest next-gen games they put out, period.
516364	519406	It's such a great game because there's so much to do in it.
519886	522988	You need to get all the little pieces and read about the characters.
523008	523988	There's trophies.
524428	527970	There's the single-player mode where you do the adventure.
528070	531992	There's the mini-games, the little challenges, hit the targets.
532252	535274	There's so many cool little things that just keep this game going.
535494	537755	And that's just, oh man, I just love the game.
538835	540755	And I was also rediscovering F-Zero today.
541056	547477	Oh yeah, I was trying to, because I was hooking up the GameCube again, and I wanted to try out some of these games that support widescreen TV.
547957	553018	And I'm kind of upset, though, because Nintendo does not support component cable anymore.
553358	556218	So if I want to hook up to my HDTV, I have to use S-Video.
556498	561139	Well, S-Video on the HDTV makes things look blurry compared to the PlayStation 2.
561559	562699	F-Zero looked blurry!
563079	566200	And that's kind of upsetting, because F-Zero is a really sharp-looking game.
566260	567240	It's an awesome-looking game.
567740	570362	I went to Nintendo's website to try and find a component cable.
570642	571543	They stopped making them.
571783	572303	Third party.
573644	575906	I can't even find a third party cable at Fry's or anything.
575926	577927	Actually, I think that Lixing carries them.
577967	579208	Maybe that's where I'm going to have to go.
579448	580429	But here's the other weird thing.
580829	586714	Okay, since mid-2004, Nintendo stopped putting the digital output port on the back of the GameCubes.
586794	595480	If you didn't buy your GameCube before probably when the 79 price drop or whatever it's at now, your GameCube doesn't have this port and you'll never have the component.
595500	595600	Okay.
596016	602998	It really irks me about Nintendo's lack of next-generation television support.
603878	612841	If they're going to go up to the next level with next-gen gaming, and we all heard that story a while back where they're saying Revolution's not going to support HDTV, that really bothers me because, you know...
614261	622229	After launch, a couple years after launch, a lot more people are going to be buying these HDTVs and they will be a bigger market share and Nintendo's going to be left out cold.
622309	629116	Especially since, you know, I've got these pictures up of the PS3 that I took at E3 with the two HDMI ports on the back.
629316	630237	Oh, very sexy.
630758	636984	Yeah, in case you have two HDTVs sitting next to each other.
637643	642549	I know I have five of them sitting next to each other, so that'll be no problem.
642609	644391	That makes me think, though, remember the iLink?
645852	649076	That probably could be for dual output for multiplayer games.
649797	650357	Very possible.
650678	651118	Very possible.
651599	654602	So anyway, I still love you, Nintendo, but come on, get with the times.
655063	658827	It's time to start supporting HD a little better, and I hope they change their mind on the revolution.
659857	661238	and remake the component cables.
662099	666482	While they're at it, they should drop the price on those plasma TVs because they're too fucking expensive.
666863	673547	You know, but I got mine at Costco and it's not a plasma, but it's just an HD regular TV and it's nice.
673607	687378	One thing that Costco doesn't advertise, which is a very good advantage of buying things from there, no matter how long you have owned something, if anything on it goes wrong, you can take it back and they have to take it back for a full refund or replacement.
687718	687838	Okay.
689063	690324	Even if it's 10 years.
693465	697627	We're gamers just like you guys out there listening, so we're just telling you guys where to get the good deal.
697867	702569	And I shopped around for HDTV, and I seriously felt Costco was the best deal.
702769	704610	We like quality for our gaming goodness.
706391	710273	Let's talk about some news tonight going into next gen.
710853	712834	Let's talk about the next generation Sonic.
713494	717076	They teased it a little bit at E3, but now they are officially announcing...
717852	721615	that they are going to be making a next-gen Sonic the Hedgehog game, Sega of course.
722216	728861	It's part of their Tokyo Game Show lineup, and Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be coming out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.
729381	733745	No word yet about a Revolution release, but nobody's really talking about the Revolution yet.
733825	735226	I imagine they will early next year.
736047	741591	By the way, Sega's also going to be showing them at Tokyo Game Show a mech game called Chromehounds for the 360.
742191	743132	Which looks sexy.
744673	745013	And a...
746118	750102	A Sonic Riders game for Xbox, PS2, and GameCube.
750382	751864	Chromehounds looks sexy.
751904	752725	I've seen the pictures of it.
752745	753105	What is this?
753185	754026	I don't know much about Chromehounds.
754086	754987	It's like a mech fighting game.
755027	758850	It's just like, you know, just like Armored Core or something like that.
758870	759671	It's just really good.
760312	761133	Really awesome looking.
761293	761413	Hmm.
763556	764797	I gotta pull the screenshots.
764837	766498	They looked really awesome.
766698	768379	So what site had the screenshots?
768900	771842	If I remember, it's not IGN that had the screenshots.
772242	773563	As soon as the monitor comes back up here.
774404	787114	If I remember correctly, it was I want to say the Xbox360 Updates.com 360updates.com had the screenshots, if I remember correctly.
789296	790597	Looking this up right now.
790717	791197	Oh, there it is.
791617	792178	Yeah, um
792967	794327	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
819828	821909	490, man, that's expensive for a cable.
821930	823751	Works with GameCubes worldwide.
823811	825672	Check if you have digital AV output port.
825692	827753	Yep, because if you have a new GameCube, you don't have it.
830315	831795	Anyway, I'm looking forward to the next-gen Sonic.
832116	835338	That little video that you were showing before the podcast, Loki, looked very sexy.
835378	840301	So I didn't get a chance to go to the Sega Theater at this year's E3 because it was another one of those things that had a line.
840801	842782	Oh, no, actually, the line for the Sega Theater?
842802	843082	Yeah.
843182	844423	I spent less than 10 minutes in it.
844483	844743	Damn.
845123	849166	You know, I was looking at going the last day, and it just was wrapping around the thing, and I just...
849782	852023	I was around the other side of it.
852623	853583	Less than 10 minute wait.
853723	854223	Seriously.
854804	855344	Darn you.
855684	859025	And if you were waiting in line, they came by and gave you t-shirts or plushies.
860745	861346	I lost out.
861366	862046	Maybe I'll do it next year.
862066	864086	They had those nice home theater seatings in there.
864126	864507	By the way.
865087	865447	Oh, sorry.
865487	865847	So sorry.
866528	871410	And just watching it on that screen, they had, oh, we're like, ooh, pretty.
871630	874130	I did get to play Phantasy Star Universe, so, you know, that's cool.
874851	875231	Yeah.
875251	875571	Loki?
875651	882213	I got the okay from the soon-to-be wife, because our wedding day is going to be about two weeks before E3.
882733	885614	She says, as long as my company is paying for me to go, it's okay.
886286	886426	E3 E3 E3
898425	901166	Gunstar Heroes is being re-released Sega Ages
924945	932207	Moving on, of course, two very, very highly talked about games this year when it comes to handhelds are the two puzzlers, Luminous and Meteos.
932947	937128	And, of course, very similar because they are developed by the same guy.
938889	943690	Luminous and Meteos are actually going to be re-released on one handheld system.
944530	947491	So they'll both be available on one handheld system, finally.
947551	950012	That handheld system... The Neo Geo Pocket Color!
950312	950412	No.
950951	953853	A cellular telephone will be the handheld system.
953974	955915	In other words, wah, wah, wah.
956015	957196	In other words, forget it.
957296	959758	Because cell phone game ports suck.
960639	967544	It's cute for the nostalgia value for about five minutes, but for the most part, at least here in America, our cell phones, the cell phone games suck.
967584	970507	And the single N-Gage owner out there rejoices.
971948	973089	No, it's not coming out for N-Gage.
973149	974029	I'm getting a BlackBerry.
974510	975931	They play mobile phone games, though.
975971	976792	I'm playing on a BlackBerry.
977352	978333	Snake for life.
980310	981731	Snake was the only good cell phone game
994537	997798	You guys remember, this was something we had talked about when our podcast first started.
997938	999019	I think it was like back in January.
999079	1005861	Playboy Magazine did a spread featuring the Girls of Gaming where they had Topless, Blood Rain, and Melina.
1006461	1007081	Guess what?
1007301	1009482	In October, they're doing it again!
1009542	1010363	I'm gonna buy that issue.
1010763	1011543	Just for the show.
1013584	1014665	Oh, the sacrifice.
1014685	1017226	Oh, the sacrifices you have to make.
1018166	1024289	Who are the characters you will be seeing in October's Playboy in the buff, the digital buff, or whatever you want to call it.
1024309	1026430	I feel so stupid talking about this, seriously.
1026550	1030092	I can't believe that it was... Oh my god, digital boobies!
1030612	1033934	I can't believe that it was so popular the first time they're doing it again.
1034794	1038735	Are they going to have the hot coffee mod uncensored on this?
1038995	1040996	I have no idea, but here's some of the games.
1041676	1044677	Jackie, who is a cheerleader in Midway's Blitz the League.
1045817	1048838	Carla Valenti from Atari's Indigo Prophecy.
1049658	1056079	Capcom's Dark Watch will have Cassidy and Tala, who is a vampire female.
1056239	1060861	I might add that Cassidy was killed off in about the first five minutes of the game.
1061101	1062721	Her head ripped clean from her body.
1063393	1065054	Playboy Mansion Private Party
1085322	1107431	but Namco doesn't want to be left out they'll have a character from Hellgate London and of course Sony's God of War getting in on it as well I know it's funny everybody's joke about this is they're all what the hell's Hellgate London they're all we don't even know what that game is I've actually never heard of this myself and I'm kind of reading this going okay must be some game I just haven't heard of I can't play them all anyway
1108574	1110455	What was the original spread called before?
1111156	1111556	I don't know.
1112016	1113937	Digital... I just closed the story.
1114037	1116459	Don't do any more research on this.
1116519	1117359	It lowers your IQ.
1119280	1122562	This is a very interesting story I think we ought to talk about here.
1123783	1125424	Because this affects us here in California.
1125464	1128146	Of course, Orange Lounge Radio, we're based out of Sacramento, California.
1129406	1131367	But we do have a worldwide audience.
1131548	1133369	But this is something that's going on in California.
1133389	1137411	And California's kind of been known to set the tone for the rest of the nation sometimes when it comes to certain bills.
1138155	1139335	Assembly Bill 1179.
1141156	1149099	This is the bill that Assemblyman Leland Yee was kind of behind a couple months ago when the hot coffee thing was really big.
1149779	1156662	It prohibits retailers from selling violent games to minors or else they'll be fined $1,000 for each violation.
1157142	1162944	It passed in the California Senate by a vote of 22 to 9 and it passed in the Assembly 65 to 7.
1163664	1166245	So it's now sitting on Governor Schwarzenegger's
1167429	1173234	and speaking of feeling like an idiot saying something, Governor Schwarzenegger's desk right now waiting to be signed.
1173314	1176036	He must sign or veto the bill by October 9th.
1178815	1185380	No word yet on which way he'll go, but probably, considering the fairly overwhelming support, he will probably sign this bill.
1185981	1188282	And it would go into effect January 1st, 2006.
1190424	1203034	By the way, the bill will also require that the games be labeled as being for sale to adults only by a solid 18 sticker, no smaller than 2 inches by 2 inches, on the front of the package.
1204019	1209402	So that's very interesting because if you think about it a Game Boy Advance game is only 5 inches by 5 inches the packaging.
1209662	1211904	So a little 18 sticker would take up like half the box.
1212624	1217647	The bill also makes no mention of the current ESRB system.
1218308	1230795	So the bill defines its own means of a violent video game saying a video game in which the range of options available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being.
1232256	1233597	Wow, that goes for all of them.
1234465	1235505	Bye-bye all fighting games.
1235586	1236126	It's retarded.
1251671	1255133	Um, Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks is going gold.
1255893	1260915	Uh, this was a game that, uh, I played a little bit at E3 and I actually kind of enjoyed it.
1261515	1264297	Um, didn't think I would, um, but it's actually kind of cool.
1264377	1270179	It's a neat little, um, it's not like a typical Mortal Kombat game because it's more of like a 3D adventure type thing.
1270359	1274661	Um, or I shouldn't say 3D, but, uh, yeah, 3D ISO, you know, perspective type game.
1275231	1281416	Um, where you're just, you know, going around killing things, which will probably be one of the first games to carry an 18 sticker, by the way.
1283517	1290722	Um, and that game has recently gone gold, and it'll be coming out for $49.99 on September 19th.
1290842	1291423	That's next week.
1291583	1293324	Our UK listeners get it on the 23rd.
1293765	1294145	Very cool.
1294585	1295286	It's not next week.
1296907	1298108	It'll be a week after Monday.
1298888	1299248	Oh, okay.
1299749	1299929	Ha!
1299949	1299989	Ha!
1301462	1303783	DarkSakura, what kind of news do you have for us tonight?
1303803	1305523	Well, just checking the UK release dates.
1305543	1308264	I did see on the 16th, E6 comes out on PlayStation 2.
1308304	1309145	Burnout Revenge on the 23rd.
1322598	1325181	ER The Game for PC on the 23rd.
1325542	1326964	There's some pretty neat stuff.
1327004	1328125	Meteos on the 23rd.
1328526	1330248	Lots of stuff coming out on the 23rd.
1331690	1336236	Including Myst5, Mortal Kombat, Rugby Challenge 2006, and Sniper Elite.
1338078	1338839	There's some pretty good stuff.
1338919	1345104	Actually, Advance Wars DS comes out on the 30th there too, as well as Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow on the 29th.
1345444	1347346	Advance Wars DS is one of those games I've got to pick up.
1347386	1350008	I've been hearing a lot of good things about it, so I want to check it out.
1350168	1353511	If you've got the other two, it has a tie-in on there.
1353551	1354972	Actually, you get more options in the shop.
1355032	1357174	Oh, like if you put the Advance game in the bottom slot?
1357394	1357595	Yep.
1357635	1358375	Very cool.
1358555	1361178	I'm liking this DS interacting with the other ports.
1361298	1361458	Good.
1362188	1368672	Another game, checking out Yahoo UK and Ireland games, is Winx Club.
1368712	1370173	Konami's putting out a Winx Club game.
1371574	1372074	Hooray.
1373155	1374716	It's so cute, I guess.
1374876	1375256	I don't know.
1376397	1384622	And then lastly, Date for Animal Crossing DS, which is going to be renamed Wild World for a release.
1384942	1386062	It says first quarter 2006.
1386143	1390985	Wait, so the whole game itself is going to be called Wild World in Europe?
1391306	1391606	I think...
1392472	1393754	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1409304	1410945	Just stuff on the Silent Hill movie.
1436320	1438661	Let me see because I found a release date on it.
1439142	1442243	And I'm going to take this as a tentative date because I haven't seen too much official.
1442724	1447327	According to BloodyDisgusting.com, it says... Great website name.
1447807	1449208	Well, it's... I know.
1449228	1451049	If you want your zombie movies, that's the place to go.
1451309	1451489	Right.
1452050	1453631	April 21st, 2006.
1455252	1455712	I'll be there.
1456753	1457873	You know I will be there.
1458194	1458654	Absolutely.
1460130	1484491	And also, there was an article, an interview up on IGN, where it was, I can never pronounce this guy's name, Patrick Tatopoulos, I guess, was stating that the director had told him to make, in fact, I'm going to quote, Patrick, I want those guys to look like they are made of plastic, which is exactly the opposite of what we try to do usually.
1484511	1485572	Yeah.
1486673	1492058	They're going for a very surreal, very this-can't-really-happen look.
1492918	1498423	And then a lot of what they're trying to do is they're having to redevelop some technology for it.
1498563	1500325	Please be a video game movie that doesn't suck.
1500365	1501026	Please, please, please.
1501746	1505089	Checking the scenery, though, it's at least going to visually be right.
1505690	1509213	Reading the storyline so far, it's going to be pretty dead on.
1509873	1510254	We'll see.
1511335	1511655	All right.
1511960	1512380	Thanks for watching!
1526886	1532709	I've seen a picture of somebody who had picked up We Heart Katamari from Target this weekend.
1533209	1537371	We Heart Katamari is not supposed to be out until when?
1537411	1538172	Like later this month?
1538472	1538952	The 21st.
1538992	1541554	The 21st is when We Heart Katamari is supposed to be out.
1541594	1547097	So we were curious if Target broke street or if this image was photoshopped or what have you.
1547217	1551559	And on Target's website it says they're not going to have the game through their website until the 22nd.
1553840	1554280	Electrolytes?
1579944	1582825	Yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.
1582965	1584585	It's We Love Katamari.
1585845	1586325	Let me check.
1586345	1586645	Hang on.
1587985	1588986	Yeah, SD.
1589026	1590226	Those are on the next pile.
1590526	1594106	I'm sorry, what was the game again?
1594226	1596047	It's We Love Katamari.
1597967	1598887	Yeah, we have one left.
1599287	1600327	You do have one left in stock?
1600628	1601048	Yes, we do.
1601228	1601848	Okay, great.
1601888	1602148	Thank you.
1603288	1603808	All right, bye-bye.
1604628	1605508	So get that.
1605548	1609029	This store actually admitted that they had one left in stock on the shelf.
1609431	1609951	Go figure.
1610772	1617076	So some copies of We Heart Katamari are getting out there a little bit early.
1617277	1623981	So hopefully some of our listeners of the live program ran out there to the store and probably picked up that last copy already, but we'll see.
1624402	1627644	I did confirm that at least none of the local GameStops have gotten it.
1627844	1628625	None of the local GameStops.
1628645	1630406	So we actually called some targets around here.
1630486	1634709	One of the targets around here said that they would be putting the game out on shelves Tuesday.
1635089	1635329	Yep.
1635489	1637930	Which is very interesting, because the game wasn't supposed to be out until the 21st.
1638290	1641492	So, are they doing an early... Did the release get bumped up?
1641592	1642052	Who knows?
1642272	1644073	But if you are... Not officially.
1644253	1648755	If you are hearing stories about We Heart Katamari getting out there early, it is possible.
1649795	1651476	We called them, and sure enough, they're selling it.
1653137	1653837	Moving on.
1653977	1654837	Let's get to the mailbag.
1655017	1656378	Let's do tonight's mailbag, shall we?
1657558	1661940	Of course, you can always send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orange lounge radio dot com. ...
1664912	1666553	We only have one email tonight.
1686718	1695063	Seriously, once again you frothed with rage about parents' responsibilities totally ignoring the point that consumers have a right to be informed.
1695583	1702627	To utilize your oft-used movie analogy, let's say Paramount produces a flick called Loki Has Brain Damage.
1703800	1709265	It goes through the MPAA and ends up rated R for violence, foul language, and excessive retardation.
1709905	1713529	I always allow my 12 year old to see R rated movies so I let him go.
1714189	1720755	Now unbeknownst to the rating board, Paramount secretly slips 5 minutes of close up anal penetration at the end of the credits.
1721396	1726600	This hot anal action actually means that this film should have received an NC-17 rating.
1727341	1728782	I didn't want my kid to see this.
1729222	1730864	I had been duped as a consumer.
1731525	1734047	This is an identical situation to the hot coffee mod.
1734148	1741515	If a parent decides that they will allow their children to play a game rated M, that is not the same as allowing their children to play a game rated AO.
1741975	1742335	Get it?
1743737	1744017	Loki?
1744337	1744677	Wrong.
1744978	1746359	That's completely wrong.
1747100	1752345	Because unlike the hot coffee mod, you had to put in external... Okay, you had to have a third-party cheat device in order to see it.
1752385	1755267	In other words, I would have had to purchase special...
1755998	1757760	I can see it both ways.
1757780	1760102	In one way, let the buyer beware.
1777887	1785789	You know, there is always a degree of caution that someone has to make with any purchase.
1786690	1806296	However, really, and I think that when you're dealing with how many different departments you have with the game publisher, being that I know many people now who work for various publishers, what the programmers leave in
1807014	1825647	is not necessarily going to be found by the testers unless, you know, you've got... True, the testers are playing on debug units and they are meant to break the game every way they can, do everything possible, and are given usually a set assignment for how the game should be played when they're testing it.
1826548	1834374	However, something that is programmed into a game that has had that bit of programming removed to access it
1835376	1836659	on average it's not going to be found.
1837561	1844233	So it is very likely that nobody except the programmers had any idea that this was in the game.
1845157	1854022	and that some random person, it could have been found by some random person who said, oh, wow, look what I just found coding for in the game.
1854702	1860985	You know, and if they find it on PC, of course, you know, the PlayStation one came after the PC one when they said, oh, it's here.
1861346	1862486	Let's see if it's in here.
1862726	1864968	Or it could just be a programmer going, oh, look what I did.
1866469	1871455	That's a very similar thing to what I've always said is that the programmers put it in there and they made a decision to take it out.
1871575	1874438	I imagine somebody at Rockstar said, you know what?
1874779	1875920	This is crossing the line.
1876160	1877282	This is going to get us an AO.
1877542	1878503	Take this out of the game.
1878623	1882248	And what the programmers did, instead of actually physically removing it from the game, they just took out the pointer.
1882728	1883269	Easier, right?
1883489	1884190	A lot easier.
1884230	1884911	And it also keeps...
1885451	1890733	instead of having to rewrite part of the code, it's slightly easier to remove part of it and make sure that your game ships on date.
1890873	1892073	And you know what?
1892153	1899255	But here's the thing, you know, so to try and get past this here, because we could talk about this until we're blue in the face, rest assured this will never happen again.
1899355	1901116	This is not the first game this has happened with either.
1901256	1901696	Oh, no, no, no.
1901876	1902336	Bloody Roar 3.
1902396	1903216	Yeah.
1903857	1909618	You put it in debug mode, you get necky, you know, masturbatory photos of the characters in the game.
1909758	1914140	I'd even talked about last week, a little more innocent, the hidden song in DDR, quote unquote.
1914580	1914920	Although...
1915433	1927977	Some folks have actually sent me an email that linked me to a thread on DDR Freak where some inside sources are saying that that song is actually supposed to be unlockable, just nobody's figured it out yet, but I don't know.
1928017	1930858	If nobody's unlocked it at this point, I don't think they're going to, so whatever.
1931378	1931618	But...
1933837	1939841	The point is that basically it was a lazy programming issue and it's brought this whole debate to the front.
1940362	1944585	I think that there was a large portion of Rockstar that didn't realize that this was going to be found.
1944605	1945926	They did not intend for this to be found.
1945986	1946326	It did.
1947067	1957294	Now they're taking the heat for it and rest assured this lazy programming incident will never happen again because that testing process will be changed to prevent this from ever happening to a future game because Rockstar's taking a lot of heat for it.
1957555	1957895	Should they?
1957955	1958355	Shouldn't they?
1958495	1958876	I don't know.
1959396	1963319	It's not an easy answer because you could say
1963795	1966777	Were they ignorant or did they know what they were doing?
1966897	1967558	We don't know.
1967938	1972201	And in the movie analogy, remember the rescuers?
1974283	1976845	Yeah, they always say they put sex things in the Disney movies and stuff.
1977538	1978639	They did it in Roger Rabbit.
1978699	1979920	Yeah, yeah, yeah.
1979960	1986825	But the thing is that the only way that this would have ever really been... The average eye is going to see it as a blip across the screen.
1987085	1987346	Right.
1987506	1993050	Like, one time I was watching a cartoon that I used to tape when I lived in Alabama.
1993090	1993971	I don't remember what it was.
1994411	1996012	And I saw the color changed weirdly.
1996673	1999895	I went back and freestramed it on a picture of the American flag.
2001777	2003398	The animators just happened to stick in there.
2004741	2006867	or even places where there were missing frames.
2007348	2010517	The average person isn't going to see that unless they take an effort to go back and look at it.
2011605	2038739	and if this person is saying that they monitor what their kids are watching obviously for them to go have a third party cheat device cheat in the game then go into this you're not monitoring what your kids are doing so you know what you're the blame still and you know what you can't come and bitch about you know Rockstar saying oh no oh this wasn't supposed to be in the game the game's maturity it's for over 17 you know what adults only is over 18 one year difference
2039324	2040305	We're talking nothing.
2040345	2042466	That's like the difference between PG and PG-13.
2042726	2044447	There is really no difference.
2044927	2045587	And you know what?
2046348	2048148	You really should be monitoring what your kids are watching.
2048168	2049769	You shouldn't be playing the games in the first place.
2049929	2054532	If you let them go to R-rated movies anyways, they're probably seeing real boobies in those R-rated films.
2054912	2059314	And this pixelated representation of what is supposed to be sex, and mind you...
2060149	2065814	The Carl Johnson character, the main male in it, does not get naked in this because it was unfinished.
2066015	2067616	Does not get naked, only the woman.
2067956	2072241	So it's not even, oh my god, they saw, you know, penis and ass, you know.
2072661	2075904	It's just pixelated boobies, okay?
2076264	2078947	And mature rated games like God of War that have
2079287	2080449	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
2096690	2100254	This, you did not, nobody knew that there would be the sex thing in the game.
2100414	2109525	I'm sorry, you know, calling, you know, the racist people, murdering the blacks and stuff, and the gang violence, that's okay, but you know, boobies, not okay.
2109625	2110145	I'm sorry.
2110165	2110746	I'm just saying.
2110806	2115872	But in defense, in defense though, I do think that Rockstar was at fault.
2116863	2118545	Because of a lazy programmer, yes.
2119025	2119445	Exactly.
2119826	2130975	And no matter who it is in the company, as long as that game was released, that company has a legal requirement to make sure that the product that they've put out on the market is exactly what they are advertising.
2131696	2135780	I agree, and that's where I think you're getting a little off, Loki, is because this is the issue.
2135820	2138322	The issue is not, oh my god, somebody saw Digitized Boobies.
2138702	2142185	But the issue is that Rockstar did not tell anyone that that was in the game.
2142205	2146349	Whereas with God of War, they said, yeah, full-on female boobies everywhere.
2147330	2150233	But with this game, they said, oh, there's no sex.
2150253	2154236	Sure, you can blow people's heads off with rocket launchers, whatever, but there is no hardcore sex in the game.
2154276	2155157	It is bonus.
2155197	2158080	There was hardcore sex in the game.
2158140	2159361	Am I everything?
2159401	2162123	Because I'm going to be a parent in a couple years.
2162263	2162464	Mm-hmm.
2163667	2169334	When you buy something that, and trust me, I remember fully well what a devious little child I was.
2170596	2173279	That's not the end of your responsibility.
2175126	2176707	There is such a thing called maintenance.
2177087	2177367	All right.
2177407	2180288	We got to move on because we could beat this top of the ground.
2180308	2181509	It's just, you know, I hate hearing it.
2181569	2184370	I say from here on out, no more hot coffee ever.
2184650	2185471	Or take it to the forums.
2185851	2187612	Yeah, go to our website.
2187632	2188772	Go to OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2188872	2190633	Send Loki a personal email.
2190693	2192174	Loki at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.
2192194	2195395	I'm just personally sick of these people going, are you a rock star?
2195535	2196756	Thank you for watching!
2215371	2216692	Certainly violence being advertised.
2216712	2221576	I really think that in the end it shouldn't be the responsibility of the video game company to censor their product.
2221976	2226639	However, I do think they should make sure that the consumer is fully aware of the product that they're purchasing.
2226679	2227299	I can agree with that.
2227460	2227740	Alright.
2228200	2228560	Moving on.
2228801	2229121	Moving on.
2229901	2232823	Let's talk about... The only hot coffee I ever want to see is the kind I get at Starbucks.
2232983	2233304	Alright.
2233364	2234645	Let's move on.
2234905	2242390	Speaking of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas, that re-release without the coffee mod, it will be coming out next week.
2243511	2243611	Um...
2244238	2248622	Which I suppose, as a little footnote to the story, look how long it took for that patch to come out.
2248722	2253406	That's how long this game would have been delayed if they'd gone back and done what they should have done.
2254366	2255187	Just food for thought.
2259263	2263347	Murder in China based on a MMORPG.
2263447	2273235	According to the Beijing Morning Post, a young woman has been charged with murdering her fiancé for, quote, too much time playing online games.
2273856	2274576	I think that's it.
2274817	2276898	No more online games for the Chinese.
2277279	2277539	Ever.
2278340	2278720	Stop.
2280485	2289888	The woman in question apparently got fed up with her unemployed fiancé for spending more time online than looking for a job so he could pay for the wedding.
2290488	2293068	So on August 6th, allegedly, she did the deed.
2299728	2302511	and he wasn't getting off his ass looking for a job.
2302551	2304332	Actually, we did spend a year like that.
2304933	2309096	But then again, we had the money in the bank to afford it.
2309277	2310558	We could afford for him to not work.
2310658	2318725	However, had that money not been there and I was having to support him or he was just sitting on his ass, I'd have left him.
2319466	2319986	Shit yeah.
2320527	2323469	It's because I have a brain in my head and I use it.
2323609	2324770	Oh, it's just interesting.
2324810	2326652	Instead of dumping his ass, she shot him.
2327105	2327886	or whatever she did.
2328266	2329127	It doesn't say.
2329167	2329748	I don't want to know.
2330248	2337676	Either way, you're without him, you know, and now you've got to deal with finding a date when you get out of the prison, I guess.
2337756	2339738	Only they were playing more of the hot coffee mod.
2339758	2342040	They would have learned that they can solve their problems by having... Stop.
2342060	2344022	We said no more hot coffee.
2344123	2344843	Stop right now.
2345144	2348807	Hot coffee talk is banned from the podcast.
2348948	2349368	All right.
2351926	2352446	You know what?
2353246	2354767	I'm going to make a game called Hot Coffee.
2354787	2358228	More than ever, we need some of DarkSakura's advice column.
2358248	2364910	Because if we stayed inside and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to get murdered by our fiancés.
2365250	2369011	So DarkSakura has her advice column for us.
2369191	2371412	And DarkSakura, what are you going to be telling us about tonight?
2371672	2376514	Today's bit of advice is how to drown your co-host in hot coffee.
2377094	2377434	Oh, wait.
2378114	2380895	How to escape from a car hanging over the edge of a cliff.
2382943	2385724	1.
2383343	2385724	Do not shift your weight or make any sudden movements.
2386805	2385724	2.
2387365	2392089	If the front doors are still over land, use these doors to make your escape regardless of which way your car is facing.
2392109	2392089	3.
2396912	2400154	If the front doors are over the edge, proceed slowly to the rear of the car.
2401655	2400154	4.
2401795	2403956	Reassess your situation and make your escape.
2404337	2406458	Will opening the rear doors cause the car to slide?
2406952	2408552	If not, open them slowly and get out.
2409072	2414433	Otherwise, use a steering wheel lock or screwdriver to break the window and climb out as quickly as possible.
2414993	2416594	But my final piece of advice?
2416694	2416954	Yes.
2418554	2419654	I have two, actually.
2420434	2429576	Either don't pull a Thelma and Louise or make sure that you have one of those drag strip parachutes attached to the back of your car so at least when you land, it'll be softer.
2430616	2430956	Sounds good.
2431356	2432597	Or how about don't drive off cliffs?
2432757	2433517	That would be my advice.
2434057	2434797	Don't drive off cliffs.
2435854	2437335	Don't drive anywhere but in Colorado.
2439317	2439617	What?
2440057	2440478	Flatland.
2441098	2442659	Don't talk on your cell phone while driving.
2444321	2445622	Colorado has the Rockies.
2446563	2447783	I'm talking about the flat part.
2447924	2450065	It's kind of hard to drive your car up a mountain.
2450926	2451286	Anyway.
2452747	2453808	There's cliffs on a mountain.
2453848	2454169	Forget it.
2454789	2455149	Forget it.
2456290	2458392	The only cliffs I care about are Cliff Notes.
2458860	2462723	Nintendo is going to be moving into the mobile phone market.
2462843	2464144	No games just yet.
2464224	2466666	No cell phone Mario, no cell phone Zelda.
2467066	2479175	However, on October 17th, Nintendo Mobile will be providing subscribers with video game related content such as wallpapers, ringtones, and sound effects from the Super Mario Bros.
2479195	2479555	series.
2479915	2482297	Oh, one thing I should note, this is in Japan only.
2482897	2483278	Durr.
2483658	2484559	Like I told you that.
2484719	2487761	No, but they actually are going to be porting over the classic games from what I hear.
2488832	2489634	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
2497950	2500331	A couple puzzle games are okay.
2500811	2502092	I liked that Before Crisis game.
2502132	2502712	That was pretty fun.
2503352	2506473	The Final Fantasy Before Crisis.
2507154	2509014	I think even Before Crisis is going to suck.
2509034	2512075	It would only be good if they re-released it to the PSP.
2512355	2517977	Cell phone is not the place to be gaming because at least on my phone most of the games are Java based and it's slow.
2518518	2523099	A puzzle game works okay but not a fast paced puzzle game like Tetris even sucks.
2523119	2524720	I've seen better games on a freaking
2525280	2535782	Graphing Calculator I've seen better games on the Apple 2E Loadrunner, Kicks Oregon Trail, yo Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world?
2536142	2554365	Well, the group We Are Back is still teasing the fact that they're going to be releasing a downgrader and this will downgrade everything from 2.0 on to back to 1 and that's going to be it right there Homebrew is going to be loud for everybody and yeah
2555435	2557317	So anyways, so that's what's going on there.
2557417	2561540	They're also having some homebrew contests for PSP games, which is kind of interesting.
2561580	2567385	So they have some entries for that that are actually, they're kind of plugging on PSP updates.
2567505	2569127	Some of them look pretty interesting.
2569887	2581877	Also a program was released the other day actually that you can change the little intro video on, you know, have the little small clip that plays when you turn on your PSP or play a game or whatever.
2582418	2582998	You can change that.
2583218	2586841	And they have a demonstration on there on how to do that as well.
2587001	2588682	So you can customize your PSP a little bit more.
2589742	2596646	And other than that, really not too much else going on with the PSP.
2597387	2601369	Now, I should also say... Oh, one more thing I almost forgot.
2602029	2606852	They're actually releasing another emulator, of course, coming out.
2607433	2611655	And that one was for... Oh, what was it?
2612932	2613272	I don't remember.
2613372	2615254	Anyways, enough of that.
2616575	2617035	Let's see.
2617055	2619837	Other than that, lots of homebrew stuff coming out for the DS.
2620197	2622459	Because, you know, the DS isn't to be forgotten.
2623400	2624320	And, yeah.
2624521	2626222	So, we'll just have to wait for the downgrader.
2626342	2628864	They're still saying a couple more weeks.
2630165	2631566	And then the shit will hit the fan.
2632586	2632747	Yeah.
2633807	2634068	Alright.
2635669	2636129	Moving on.
2636169	2638651	A couple last stories here for tonight's.
2639348	2665648	Civilization 4 is going to be doing a little pre-order program A special limited edition collector's package, which has collector's packaging A CD soundtrack of the game, a keyboard template, a tech map, and a spiral-bound version of the manual So that's just a special pre-order edition Civilization 4, of course, coming out this October I'm interested in it I love, love, love, love, love, love, love the original Civilization game
2666289	2667670	Never really got into Civ 2 or 3.
2668110	2668431	Why?
2668691	2669091	I don't know.
2669131	2672053	I think they just got too complex for me at that point or something.
2672754	2673054	I don't know.
2673094	2674035	I liked it simple.
2674916	2678939	Simple graphics, simple mechanics to the game and everything.
2678999	2680380	So the first one's my favorite.
2680420	2683542	But I am very curious about 4 and I'll definitely give it a try.
2683602	2687085	I'm certainly wanting to see what they've done with the series since 3.
2689586	2695611	Mega Man is going to be making an appearance at the Tokyo Game Show in Capcom's booth.
2696192	2701413	The interesting thing is that the game is called Rockman Rockman, which would be Mega Man Mega Man.
2701993	2703053	Which game now?
2703754	2705434	It's called Rockman Rockman.
2705594	2707154	Yeah, it's a remake of the first Mega Man.
2707514	2708555	Yeah, I was going to get to that.
2708855	2710195	Sorry.
2710455	2716336	It happens to be it's going to be a remake of the original Mega Man game is the rumor about what it's going to be.
2717196	2721177	But we don't know exactly what system it's going to be on, but they're saying PSP.
2721357	2722077	It is PSP.
2722317	2725118	And they actually have the site has launched for it.
2725863	2726683	I didn't know that part.
2726883	2729124	Yeah, the site has launched for it.
2729144	2732486	Let me see if I can pull it up here to see what the site was.
2734266	2735347	It looks really interesting.
2735407	2739228	Mega Man's very, it's very cartoony, unlike the original Mega Man.
2739508	2746251	His head is ginormous, which I don't know why they did it that way, but it's interesting.
2746731	2750313	You can actually make your own levels on it, which is pretty cool.
2752591	2753932	Wait, you can make your own levels?
2754012	2755674	Yeah, it has a level editor built into it.
2755774	2756474	That's cool.
2757195	2757916	That's very cool.
2758216	2759417	It's coming out for the PSP.
2761478	2766923	I can't remember the website, but I'll find it out while we're talking and I'll let you guys know.
2767083	2767984	We're almost at the end of the show.
2768004	2768805	I only got one more story.
2768885	2769445	I'll be hurry.
2769485	2769846	I'll hurry.
2770046	2770286	All right.
2771006	2771867	Last story here.
2772268	2775430	We always seem to talk about these video games that are being turned into movies.
2776491	2779634	MTV, hooray, hooray, bought the film rights.
2779834	2781095	I said that with a little bit of sarcasm, by the way.
2781530	2785014	Midway's The Suffering Executive Vice President of MTV Films David Gale
2804827	2811129	It makes perfect sense for us to work with Midway, Stan Winston, and Circle of Confusion on bringing the suffering to life as a feature film.
2811529	2819212	Yes, that's why I think it's interesting that it says gaming is such a huge part of the culture for MTV's audience when I can't think of many gaming shows that MTV has aired.
2819772	2826034	Maybe a special here and there, and a category on their video music awards, but not really a huge part of the network.
2826494	2828195	Then again, music videos aren't a huge part of the network either.
2828215	2829715	I think they're referring to their audience themselves.
2829855	2830315	I suppose.
2830596	2830776	Anyway.
2831716	2831976	Anyway.
2833186	2838647	I guess we'll see when we get some stars and directors attached, but all we know for now is that MTV is producing them.
2838667	2839807	That's not necessarily a bad thing.
2839887	2843088	MTV, even though I'm knocking on them a little bit, they've actually put out some pretty good films.
2843888	2846509	Election, from a couple years ago, is one of my favorite movies.
2846569	2847029	It's great.
2847489	2849510	And MTV was actually behind that, so go figure.
2849590	2853310	And one that I like that's coming out pretty soon was Roll Balance.
2853550	2854231	Looks interesting.
2854731	2856331	Weren't they behind Napoleon Dynamite, too?
2856911	2857571	I want to say yes.
2857731	2858151	I think so.
2859592	2860592	Even though that movie kind of...
2861314	2861995	You're welcome.
2862015	2863376	Loki, your final thought?
2889690	2890991	Happy birthday to me.
2891091	2892311	That's right, happy birthday to you.
2893532	2897473	And for your birthday, I had Final Fantasy VII Advent Children leaked to the internet.
2897533	2899154	Oh yeah, I forgot to mention that.
2899754	2900154	There you go.
2901615	2906337	Alright, have a good night, or day, or afternoon, whenever you happen to be listening to this, everybody.
