11:06.621 --> 11:11.782

11:11.822 --> 11:12.722
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we hate Life 365.

11:12.762 --> 11:13.223
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I really...

11:25.157 --> 11:26.799
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, I was playing jump rope with my puppy.

11:29.461 --> 11:37.989
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Live365, when they announce a particular time to do their maintenance, needs to actually fucking stick with it!

11:39.070 --> 11:40.551
[SPEAKER_04]: And I need more booze, that's all.

11:41.212 --> 11:42.473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, one more thing.

11:44.274 --> 11:50.360
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting married at the Department of Justice is like going to the DMV of weddings, thank you.

11:51.826 --> 11:53.347
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your wedding, though?

11:53.928 --> 11:59.052
[SPEAKER_04]: It was short, and Dan kept making faces at me to keep me from violently heaving all over the performer.

11:59.273 --> 12:03.777
[SPEAKER_11]: Iguana Girl said that she only had to go through, like, two pieces of Kleenex.

12:04.257 --> 12:06.039

12:06.079 --> 12:06.239

[SPEAKER_04]: Two pieces of Kleenex.

12:08.421 --> 12:13.765
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to, like, you know, start heaving violently, and Dan's like, By the way, I'm going to make faces at you.

12:14.206 --> 12:15.066
[SPEAKER_04]: You bastard!

12:16.167 --> 12:18.770
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm married now, and all of this stuff is mine.

12:23.178 --> 12:28.204
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to Loki with his FUs of the week.

12:33.210 --> 12:34.411
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's my screwdriver.

12:34.881 --> 12:40.344
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, um, my excuse of the week, first off is to Nintendogs because I actually have to take care of the dog, I have to feed it every day.

12:40.404 --> 12:41.705
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like having an actual dog.

12:42.025 --> 12:44.206
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I have to pay, you know, have an actual dog?

12:44.266 --> 12:44.766
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.

12:45.387 --> 12:51.050
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, so, I do it for the hell of it, and I don't have a jump rope, so that's sad.

12:51.990 --> 13:01.035
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but anyways, um, then also, uh, fuck you to Stupid Drivers because they're all out there, just, you know, hordes of them, especially the holiday season.

13:01.775 --> 13:03.236
[SPEAKER_10]: Just sucks, and...

13:03.598 --> 13:06.880
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Live 365 because I had a lot of music I wanted to play and that sucks.

13:07.220 --> 13:07.720
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

13:08.601 --> 13:10.021
[SPEAKER_10]: I will still be drinking next week.

13:11.662 --> 13:12.883
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you get to drink next week?

13:13.243 --> 13:14.344
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what is next week?

13:15.164 --> 13:15.984
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, your birthday.

13:17.505 --> 13:18.005
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.

13:19.346 --> 13:21.207
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm taking that Monday off.

13:21.707 --> 13:26.810
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully I can drink next week, you know, depending on if I can get a ride.

13:27.010 --> 13:30.872
[SPEAKER_10]: But depending if I can get a ride, I'll be drinking next week.

13:31.072 --> 13:31.312
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

13:31.452 --> 13:31.873
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all.

13:32.493 --> 13:32.753
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

13:33.322 --> 13:46.171
[SPEAKER_11]: MyFUs MyFU of the week goes to Live365 for fucking up our live show and disappointing all our listeners.

13:46.271 --> 13:47.752
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate you guys.

13:48.232 --> 13:57.038
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I know, in case somebody from Live365 actually hears this, I don't really hate you guys, but you done pissed me off with this.

13:57.138 --> 13:58.739
[SPEAKER_11]: This was not good for business.

13:59.120 --> 14:02.062
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we go somewhere else because of this, I don't want you to be surprised.

14:03.181 --> 14:04.762
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but that's that for now.

14:05.302 --> 14:11.244
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, otherwise, I give an FU to Miklatov for forcing me to buy Pump It Up, although he did pay for half of it, so I love him for that.

14:11.644 --> 14:12.125
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov?

14:13.705 --> 14:24.749
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I ended up paying $20 for Pump, so I guess I shouldn't complain, but that's more money than I've ever spent playing Pump It Up, so... Thank you.

14:25.230 --> 14:26.110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Miklatov.

14:26.850 --> 14:27.310
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

14:28.371 --> 14:28.631
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

14:29.391 --> 14:30.351
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and let me think.

14:30.411 --> 14:30.792
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

14:31.252 --> 14:31.332
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

14:33.025 --> 14:38.387
[SPEAKER_11]: I give an F you to the fact that I have a whole week off of work, and because of the price of gas, I'm not going to be able to go anywhere.

14:38.907 --> 14:40.847
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of pisses me off.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.148
[SPEAKER_11]: Gas prices suck.

14:42.168 --> 14:46.229
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you drove up here today, Mel B. Because gas prices fucking suck.

14:46.549 --> 14:46.849
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

14:47.249 --> 14:49.330
[SPEAKER_04]: In Georgia, $6 per premium.

14:49.830 --> 14:55.552
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, it's hard to complain when we're here and not somewhere that was affected by that horrible, horrible hurricane.

14:56.052 --> 14:56.252
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

14:57.168 --> 14:57.989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it still sucks.

14:58.029 --> 14:58.650
[SPEAKER_11]: I still want to bitch.

14:58.710 --> 15:09.124
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at least if there's any consolation, the Attorney General of California is actually looking into investigating the gas companies out here for price gouging because we're basically not affected by any...

15:11.022 --> 15:12.023
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching.

15:12.043 --> 15:12.643
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next time.

15:33.186 --> 15:36.208
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're going to go around and see some other angst in the room tonight.

15:36.549 --> 15:44.014
[SPEAKER_11]: And tonight's music we're going to use as the background for the FU music was something we were going to plug on tonight's show, except we didn't fucking have a show.

15:44.154 --> 15:50.259
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a compilation, Blood and Synth, a compilation, and it comes from Dark Records.

15:50.299 --> 15:56.984
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should visit their website, darkrecordsn, the letter N, darkrecordsnclothing.com.

15:57.024 --> 15:59.366
[SPEAKER_11]: So not and, but an N, darkrecordsnclothing.

16:00.067 --> 16:02.869
[SPEAKER_11]: And the song we're going to use is In Vitro with Foreign Land.

16:03.479 --> 16:03.619
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B

16:15.487 --> 16:20.709
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh gosh, definitely EffieTheLife365 for not coming through this time.

16:21.029 --> 16:25.531
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when I listen to you guys at work, man, I listen to some of the worst ads that they put out.

16:26.132 --> 16:36.856
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like after three songs, I have to hear some booty-ass R&B singer who ain't never gonna cut it in any kind of... I mean, they're not gonna be American Idol, Botswana Idol, none of that shit.

16:36.976 --> 16:38.277
[SPEAKER_12]: Botswana Idol!

16:38.397 --> 16:42.639
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, we are seriously contemplating moving after tonight's little shindig, so just...

16:43.946 --> 16:50.415
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that our listeners will move with us if we go to another site, so not to sound like a pompous ass, but we know they will.

16:50.975 --> 16:51.436
[SPEAKER_11]: We love them.

16:51.616 --> 16:52.437
[SPEAKER_11]: They love us.

16:53.018 --> 16:53.779
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, sorry.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.701
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, F you to them.

16:56.262 --> 16:58.064
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to $3 gas, man.

16:58.084 --> 17:01.629
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, I mean, yeah, I'm a sucker for driving up here, but hey, you know.

17:02.031 --> 17:03.431
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be a fool for you guys any week.

17:04.792 --> 17:04.932
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

17:05.272 --> 17:05.712
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

17:06.532 --> 17:09.853
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B, can I... Is this supposed to be a secret or can I say thank you for this?

17:09.973 --> 17:14.253
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Mel B gave me copies of Orifice and Zonk's latest albums.

17:14.554 --> 17:15.114
[SPEAKER_04]: Orifice.

17:15.594 --> 17:16.294
[SPEAKER_11]: Best name ever.

17:16.474 --> 17:18.114
[SPEAKER_11]: Or-if-is, I guess.

17:18.734 --> 17:20.835
[SPEAKER_11]: I like saying Orifice because it sounds like a butt.

17:21.995 --> 17:31.617
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we're going to put the song Basil in the rotation because that's their new Ultramix 3 song and Zonk... We're going to play that CD at some point because they're cool.

17:32.358 --> 17:33.179
[SPEAKER_11]: So, alright.

17:33.659 --> 17:39.285
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was kind of like, uh, what was that, you can't do it on television, we were into opposites where we're actually giving props instead of giving FUs?

17:40.406 --> 17:41.467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know, whatever.

17:41.587 --> 17:43.609
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, anyway, back to reality.

17:44.049 --> 17:47.893
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, FU also to, uh, my Atari 2600, man.

17:48.314 --> 17:55.861
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I went to Classic Gaming Expo two weeks ago, I go out and buy an AC adapter and, like, a cable so I can put it into, like, a real TV and not those, like,

17:56.345 --> 17:58.146
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, RF adapters from like the 80s.

17:58.526 --> 18:02.788
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens, you know, I get all this stuff that, you know, now I can finally play Circus Atari and Breakout, and guess what?

18:03.088 --> 18:04.949
[SPEAKER_12]: My Atari 2600 is dead.

18:06.250 --> 18:07.190
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww, that sucks.

18:07.250 --> 18:10.672
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, man, 20 years, couldn't have just held out another, like, 6 months?

18:10.752 --> 18:11.552
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, what system?

18:11.973 --> 18:12.233
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my 2600.

18:13.473 --> 18:20.397
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, depending on how long you're gonna be in town, um, the auction out here, usually sells 2600s pretty damn cheap.

18:20.877 --> 18:21.037
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

18:21.673 --> 18:23.194
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe, might be crashing out of frame.

18:23.214 --> 18:23.994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hunt one down for you.

18:24.435 --> 18:25.375
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good times.

18:25.836 --> 18:31.259
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that's about... You can mod those new Atari, whatever those... Flashbacks?

18:31.399 --> 18:32.099
[SPEAKER_10]: The Flashbacks.

18:32.279 --> 18:36.002
[SPEAKER_10]: Flashback 2 to have a cartridge slot.

18:36.962 --> 18:38.643
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's all pinned out for you.

18:38.944 --> 18:42.125
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just solder some wires and you're good to go.

18:43.186 --> 18:43.987
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll be damned.

18:44.747 --> 18:47.509
[SPEAKER_12]: And on that note, I'm going to pass it over this way.

18:48.009 --> 18:49.390
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Pixie Dust, the...

18:50.163 --> 18:51.364
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Madame.

18:51.804 --> 18:52.484
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

18:53.305 --> 18:54.045
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck me, baby.

18:54.085 --> 18:54.365
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck me.

18:54.405 --> 18:54.805
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

18:54.825 --> 18:56.106
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you hard, huh, baby?

18:56.386 --> 18:56.886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

18:56.966 --> 18:57.727
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck me, bitch.

18:58.947 --> 19:03.430
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fuck you to people that think they're Paris Hilton and they can bring their dogs in the fucking grocery store.

19:03.690 --> 19:04.810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking nasty.

19:05.211 --> 19:09.913
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm specifically pointing out one fat bitch that comes in on a scooter and smells like shit.

19:10.853 --> 19:11.814
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes in all the time.

19:12.534 --> 19:15.716
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch, no one wants to see your nasty-ass fucking chihuahua mutt.

19:16.576 --> 19:17.857
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to bring a dog in the store...

19:18.624 --> 19:22.405
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop down the $200, go get Nintendogs, and be done with it.

19:22.425 --> 19:24.406
[SPEAKER_03]: Because no one wants to see your dog climbing up your titty.

19:26.067 --> 19:26.467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

19:26.727 --> 19:27.407
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice day.

19:27.747 --> 19:28.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Viking is the shit.

19:29.508 --> 19:30.788
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm all good for now.

19:31.128 --> 19:31.548
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

19:32.609 --> 19:33.449
[SPEAKER_11]: No styling.

19:33.469 --> 19:34.349
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi!

19:34.409 --> 19:34.830
[SPEAKER_13]: How again?

19:34.850 --> 19:35.650
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi everybody.

19:37.318 --> 19:39.179
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to do a sales pitch on the phone.

19:39.239 --> 19:39.599
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

19:39.779 --> 19:41.020
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I've been doing a great weekend.

19:41.440 --> 19:43.101
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no FU, so I'm going to pass the mic.

19:43.741 --> 19:44.101
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful.

19:44.161 --> 19:44.661
[SPEAKER_13]: Positive.

19:44.681 --> 19:45.902
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to be positive about this weekend.

19:46.142 --> 19:48.343
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you and your positive.

19:48.363 --> 19:49.023
[SPEAKER_13]: You know where that goes?

19:49.223 --> 19:49.503
[SPEAKER_13]: Anywhere.

19:49.663 --> 19:50.124
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here you go.

19:50.184 --> 19:51.624
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't drinking.

19:51.644 --> 19:52.965
[SPEAKER_03]: You ain't getting any ass tonight.

19:53.445 --> 19:56.166
[SPEAKER_11]: You ain't getting no... No butt sex for you.

19:57.167 --> 19:57.567
[SPEAKER_03]: None!

19:58.327 --> 19:59.328
[SPEAKER_03]: As if there was any to get.

20:01.229 --> 20:01.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov.

20:02.662 --> 20:05.283
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, my dog is really good with the soccer ball.

20:05.503 --> 20:05.823
[SPEAKER_02]: FUs!

20:06.143 --> 20:07.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

20:08.384 --> 20:11.184
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to not being next summer for the next season of the 4400.

20:11.224 --> 20:21.247
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to... I don't know.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.688
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any FUs.

20:24.508 --> 20:25.148
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

20:26.148 --> 20:27.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.

20:28.649 --> 20:29.029
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

20:30.090 --> 20:31.530
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it for the FUs of the week.

20:34.042 --> 20:36.103
[SPEAKER_11]: What else can we get out of the way on this show here?

20:36.763 --> 20:37.184
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

20:37.824 --> 20:38.084
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

20:39.125 --> 20:39.425
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

20:39.925 --> 20:40.285
[SPEAKER_11]: Music?

20:41.066 --> 20:42.006
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we could do one song.

20:42.026 --> 20:43.167
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought another dog.

20:43.367 --> 20:43.887
[SPEAKER_11]: Two songs?

20:43.927 --> 20:45.248
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we have to do two songs?

20:45.628 --> 20:46.308
Okay, fine, one song.

20:46.429 --> 20:47.189
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll do one song.

20:48.061 --> 20:51.163
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I wanted to get out real fast though, news that happened this week.

20:51.804 --> 20:53.925
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Ultramix 2 unlock code.

20:54.486 --> 21:01.010
[SPEAKER_11]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Control report for in the credit screen and you unlock all the songs.

21:01.230 --> 21:02.251
[SPEAKER_11]: That was announced this week.

21:02.271 --> 21:05.113
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, of course I knew that for like God knows how long.

21:10.129 --> 21:11.170
[SPEAKER_12]: V-Rare Tracklist Xtreme 2

21:33.911 --> 21:43.558
[SPEAKER_11]: Destiny, the piano version, Feelings Won't Fade, Extended Transmix, Midnight Blaze, System SF Mix, Can Be Real, Soulhouse Extended, Seduction, the vocal remix.

21:43.958 --> 22:01.291
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically a lot of shit you've pretty much heard before, except we've got Yuzo Koshiro with You've Gotta Move It, but otherwise you've got Sakura, Can Be Real, Colors, Infinite Prayer, Quickening, Un De Trois, Belovin', I Need You, La Morle... Yes, I know Seduction's brand new, but you know...

22:03.433 --> 22:05.935
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it'll be a kick-butt V-Rare and you should all go buy it.

22:06.235 --> 22:09.096
[SPEAKER_11]: Put down your five bucks, go get your V-Rare.

22:09.136 --> 22:13.119
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, V2 is on its way, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

22:13.159 --> 22:20.964
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Extreme won the Video Music Awards for Best Soundtrack, but you didn't see it on the actual show because it was one of those pre-show awards they gave away.

22:21.324 --> 22:24.446
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, MTV doesn't give a shit about DDR.

22:25.266 --> 22:27.828
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's okay because I don't give a shit about MTV, so it works out.

22:29.509 --> 22:30.890
[SPEAKER_10]: A few other things that I'd mention.

22:31.270 --> 22:32.010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, go for it.

22:34.452 --> 22:42.256
[SPEAKER_10]: In case you didn't know, there's going to be a demo on the two new DDRs, DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 for Karaoke Revolution Pop.

22:43.937 --> 22:45.477
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that's some juicy tidbit.

22:45.537 --> 22:46.178
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know this.

22:46.398 --> 22:51.620
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same thing for Karaoke Revolution 4 or Party or whatever.

22:52.181 --> 22:55.122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be demos for whatever one.

22:55.911 --> 22:58.892
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've heard this anywhere yet.

22:59.172 --> 23:05.333
[SPEAKER_11]: So, wow, our listeners just got a real juicy tidbit there, so if you were able to put up with the show at this point, it was worth it.

23:05.353 --> 23:14.694
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, let me just say, well, I don't know if I can say anything, but Konami's going to be spending more time in the courts.

23:14.734 --> 23:16.535
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just put it that way.

23:16.555 --> 23:18.395
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, interesting.

23:18.475 --> 23:21.216
[SPEAKER_11]: So you made a new friend at Konami that told you all sorts of stuff, didn't you?

23:21.276 --> 23:22.336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's my new friend.

23:22.576 --> 23:23.736
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to send us actually the...

23:24.457 --> 23:27.659
[SPEAKER_10]: V-Rares for Ultra Mix 3 and Extreme 2 pretty soon.

23:27.959 --> 23:28.700
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

23:28.740 --> 23:30.280
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll get the first tidbits on that.

23:30.561 --> 23:31.361
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I'm excited.

23:31.581 --> 23:32.642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hopefully at Ultra Mix 3.

23:33.002 --> 23:35.363
[SPEAKER_10]: He said whatever he has, so... Stay tuned to Orange Lounge.

23:35.584 --> 23:40.406
[SPEAKER_10]: But we got that, and I got a ton of Diverse System stuff we've got.

23:40.426 --> 23:41.627
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, lots of fun stuff.

23:41.647 --> 23:44.789
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're going to play one song on this little special show.

23:44.809 --> 23:46.330
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually from not Diverse System.

23:46.370 --> 23:49.672
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from Good Cool, the Ultra Expander.

23:50.692 --> 23:50.853
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

23:52.284 --> 23:58.026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a remix of Absolute, the ultimate remix, and it definitely fits that title.

23:58.266 --> 23:59.606
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is.

23:59.766 --> 24:03.947
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play this for you guys on the Orange Lounge Radio Not Show that we didn't have tonight.

24:09.029 --> 24:10.509

28:23.313 --> 28:25.154
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it won the cage match that never happened, actually.

28:26.575 --> 28:28.876
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses me off because I had a really funny song.

28:30.277 --> 28:33.119
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Miklatov picked my song tonight, too, and we didn't even get to do it.

28:34.898 --> 28:35.458

29:31.892 --> 29:32.412
