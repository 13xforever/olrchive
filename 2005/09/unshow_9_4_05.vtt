07:15.820 --> 07:16.820
Yo.

07:16.820 --> 07:21.020
So Mikolatov was here for tonight's show, even though we're not doing a show.

07:21.020 --> 07:24.780
This is a special pre-taped message for our friends on the LiveJournal community who are

07:24.780 --> 07:26.900
pissed off that we didn't do a show tonight.

07:26.900 --> 07:27.940
So we're doing this for them.

07:27.940 --> 07:28.940
So three people?

07:28.940 --> 07:29.940
Yeah, I know.

07:29.940 --> 07:31.120
But this was great.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.400
You know, Mikolatov was here tonight and he was going to tell us the entire song list

07:35.400 --> 07:41.780
for Xtreme 2, but now, thanks to Live365, it's gone, not going to happen.

07:41.780 --> 07:45.680
4400 is awesome!

07:45.680 --> 07:50.220
Okay, this game is pissing me off because I'm getting

07:50.220 --> 07:53.780
every Shiba Inu except for the white one so that I can name it Menchi.

07:53.780 --> 07:58.380
Okay. Like in Excel Saga. Dork.

07:58.380 --> 08:02.420
You can always feed Menchi to the other dogs in case, you know, you didn't have enough food.

08:02.420 --> 08:06.420
Alright, alright. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to do a couple of our favorite segments here on

08:06.420 --> 08:07.340
Orange Lawn's radio

08:07.340 --> 08:10.340
for our, you know, a few dedicated people that are downloading this program.

08:10.340 --> 08:14.300
The first one we're gonna do tonight is how was your week? How was your day?

08:14.300 --> 08:16.180
but there's a twist tonight because

08:16.180 --> 08:20.340
We're talking about our bandwidth and people are gonna be downloading this program unless they you know

08:20.340 --> 08:22.340
We put it on a CD later for them to buy

08:22.460 --> 08:24.460
Because we're talking about that

08:26.260 --> 08:29.820
You have to do how was your week how was your day in one sentence

08:30.540 --> 08:33.140
How was your week? How was your day in one sentence?

08:33.860 --> 08:35.860
All right, dark Sakura

08:47.860 --> 08:51.860
Mel B, how was your week, how was your day, one sentence.

08:51.860 --> 08:55.860

11:14.020 --> 11:21.020
but I really

11:25.020 --> 11:29.180
I'm sorry I was playing jump poop with my puppy

11:29.180 --> 11:31.020
um

11:31.020 --> 11:34.980
Live 365 when they announce a particular time to do

11:34.980 --> 11:38.060
their maintenance these actually fucking stick with it

11:38.060 --> 11:42.540
and I need more booze that's all oh yeah yeah one more thing

11:42.540 --> 11:50.540
Getting married at the Department of Justice is like going to the DMV of weddings. Thank you.

11:50.540 --> 11:53.540
How was your wedding though?

11:53.540 --> 11:59.540
It was short and Dan kept making faces at me to keep me from violently heaving all over the performer.

11:59.540 --> 12:03.540
Iguana Girl said that she only had to go through two pieces of Kleenex.

12:03.540 --> 12:05.540
Oh, she went through two pieces of Kleenex?

12:05.540 --> 12:07.540
No, two pieces of Kleenex.

12:07.540 --> 12:11.940
I was about to, like, you know, start heaving violently and Dan's like,

12:11.940 --> 12:13.940
By the way, I'm gonna make faces at you.

12:13.940 --> 12:15.940
You bastard!

12:15.940 --> 12:18.940
So yeah, I'm married now, and all of this stuff is mine.

12:18.940 --> 12:21.940
That's an awesome way to look at it, FYI.

12:21.940 --> 12:28.940
Alright, let's go to, um, Loki, with his FUs of the Week.

12:32.940 --> 12:34.940
Hey, it's my screwdriver.

12:34.940 --> 12:39.140
Now, um, my official week, first off is to Nintendo because I actually have to take care

12:39.140 --> 12:41.780
of the dog, I have to feed it every day, it's like having an actual dog.

12:41.780 --> 12:44.380
Why do I have to pay, you know, have an actual dog?

12:44.380 --> 12:45.540
That sucks.

12:45.540 --> 12:51.780
But anyways, so, I do it for the hell of it, and I don't have a jump rope, so that's sad.

12:51.780 --> 12:57.780
Um, but anyways, um, then also, uh, fuck you to stupid drivers because they're all out

12:57.780 --> 13:03.300
there, just, you know, hordes of them, especially the holiday season, just sucks.

13:03.300 --> 13:07.660
Guess the live 365 because I had a lot of music. I want to play and that sucks, but you know what?

13:07.660 --> 13:09.900
I will still be drinking next week

13:11.220 --> 13:16.140
Why do you get to drink next week? Well, what is next week? Oh your birthday? Oh

13:17.360 --> 13:18.960
damn

13:18.960 --> 13:24.080
So, uh, I'm taking that Monday off. So hopefully hopefully I can drink next week, you know

13:24.900 --> 13:27.260
pending on if I can get a ride, but um

13:27.260 --> 13:31.100
Penny and if I can get a ride, I'll be drinking next week.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.500
Alright, and that's all.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.500
Alright.

13:33.500 --> 13:40.940
My FUs.

13:40.940 --> 13:46.220
My FU of the week goes to lie365 for fucking up our live show and disappointing our listeners.

13:46.220 --> 13:48.260
I hate you guys.

13:48.260 --> 13:54.980
You know, I know, in case somebody from lie365 actually hears this, I don't really hate you

13:54.980 --> 13:57.220
guys but you don't piss me off with this.

13:57.220 --> 14:01.180
This was not good for business, and if we go somewhere else because of this, you know,

14:01.180 --> 14:04.060
I don't want you to be surprised.

14:04.060 --> 14:05.660
But that's that for now.

14:05.660 --> 14:09.580
Otherwise I give an FU to Miklotov for forcing me to buy Pump It Up, although he did pay

14:09.580 --> 14:11.780
for half of it, so I love him for that.

14:11.780 --> 14:12.780
Miklotov?

14:12.780 --> 14:17.420
I know, I ended up paying $20 for Pump, so I guess I shouldn't just complain, but that's

14:17.420 --> 14:24.580
more money than I've ever spent playing Pump It Up, so...

14:24.580 --> 14:33.260
Thank you. Thank you Miklotov. Thank you. Alright. And let me think, what else? I give

14:33.260 --> 14:37.380
an F.U. to the fact that I have a whole week off of work and because of the price of gas,

14:37.380 --> 14:42.420
I'm not going to be able to go anywhere. That kind of pisses me off. Gas prices suck. I

14:42.420 --> 14:47.320
can't believe you drove up here today, Mel B. Because gas prices fucking suck. Nah, in

14:47.320 --> 14:53.300
Georgia, $6 for premium. Here, it's hard to complain when we're here and not, you know,

14:53.300 --> 14:58.580
That was affected by that horrible horrible hurricane, but yeah, it still sucks. I still want to bitch

14:58.580 --> 15:04.580
well, at least if there's any consolation to attorney general of California is actually looking into investigating the

15:05.100 --> 15:09.900
Gas companies out here for a price gouging because we're basically not affected by you any

15:10.980 --> 15:13.860
Refineries that are hallelujah stick it to the man

15:13.860 --> 15:18.020
That's what I say in the butt stick it to the man in the butt actually in in defense though

15:18.020 --> 15:21.020
So, Jubb has finally done something right.

15:21.020 --> 15:24.940
For all the people price gouging in Florida, he is arresting them and giving them hefty

15:24.940 --> 15:25.940
fines.

15:25.940 --> 15:26.940
Good.

15:26.940 --> 15:31.900
I've heard in some cases, inequivalent to the profits made after gouging the price.

15:31.900 --> 15:32.900
Sounds good to me.

15:32.900 --> 15:36.660
Alright, we're gonna go around and see some other angst in the room tonight.

15:36.660 --> 15:40.900
And tonight's music we're gonna use as a background for the F.U. music was something we were gonna

16:21.160 --> 16:24.880
Even when I listen to you guys at work, man, I listen to some of the worst ads that they

16:24.880 --> 16:25.880

16:25.880 --> 16:31.000
You know, like after three songs, I have to hear some booty-ass R&B singer who ain't never

I swear to God, we are seriously contemplating moving after tonight's little shindig, so just...

16:43.520 --> 16:47.260
We know that our listeners will move with us if we go to another site, so...

16:47.780 --> 16:51.400

16:51.400 --> 16:52.620
They love us!

16:52.620 --> 16:53.940

Okay. Oh, okay. Mel B. Can I is this supposed to be a secret or can I say thank you for this?

17:09.800 --> 17:14.980
Oh Mel B gave me copies of orifice and Zonk's latest albums orifice

17:15.260 --> 17:22.120
I know or if is I guess but it's I like saying orifice cuz you know, it sounds like a but um, so

17:22.700 --> 17:28.080
We're gonna put the song bass bass ill in the rotation because that's their new Ultra Mix 3 song and Zonk

20:44.860 --> 20:50.140

20:50.140 --> 20:55.220
that happened this week DDR ultra mix to unlock code up up down down left right

20:55.220 --> 20:58.620
left right BA up up down down left right left right BA in controller port for in

20:58.620 --> 21:03.020
the credit screen and you unlock all the songs that was announced this week of

21:03.020 --> 21:10.580
course I knew that for like god knows how long. Pssst, so did I. Shh, but that's a secret.

21:10.580 --> 21:14.860
Alright, um. I'm surprised they never figured it out for like UltraMix until like DDR spot

21:14.860 --> 21:21.140
unloaded on everybody. So on UltraMix 3, here's the hint. Try it 3 times and maybe it'll work

21:21.140 --> 21:26.140
because you know, with 1 you only had to do it once, 2, 2, so maybe 3 times. Anyway, uh,

21:26.140 --> 21:34.580
V-Rare Tracklist was revealed for Xtreme 2, a bunch of fucking repeats basically, Destiny,

21:34.580 --> 21:39.620

21:39.620 --> 21:44.020

prayer quickening under twa be lovin I need you love more lately yes I know the

21:58.980 --> 22:05.180

22:09.700 --> 22:14.740
strum mania v2 is on its way blah blah blah blah blah DDR extreme won the video

22:14.740 --> 22:18.780
music awards for best soundtrack but you didn't see it on the actual show because

22:18.780 --> 22:23.180
it was one of those pre show awards they gave away in other words MTV doesn't

22:23.180 --> 22:27.740
a shit about DDR. But that's okay, because I don't give a shit about MTV, so it works out.

22:29.260 --> 22:31.020
A few other things that I mentioned.

22:31.020 --> 22:31.660
Alright, go for it.

22:31.660 --> 22:38.540
Talking to Konami rep. In case you didn't know, there's gonna be a demo on the two new DDRs,

22:38.540 --> 22:42.140
DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, for Karaoke Revolution Pop.

22:43.740 --> 22:46.940
Now, that's some juicy tidbit. I didn't know this. Say this.

22:46.940 --> 22:52.860
And the same thing for Karaoke Revolution 4, or Party, or whatever. It's gonna be a

22:52.860 --> 22:58.860
Demos for you know, whatever one vice-versa. That's I don't think we've I've heard this anywhere yet

22:58.860 --> 23:02.120
So wow, our listeners just got a real juicy tidbit there

23:02.120 --> 23:05.360
So if you were able to put up with a show at this point also was worth it

23:06.560 --> 23:08.220
let me just say

23:08.220 --> 23:10.860
well, I don't know if I can say anything but

23:12.780 --> 23:15.620
Konami's gonna be spending more time in the courts. Let me just put that way. Ooh

23:17.860 --> 23:22.340
Interesting so you made a new friend at Konami that told you all sorts of stuff didn't you? Yeah, he's my new friend

23:22.340 --> 23:30.220
He's gonna send us actually the v-rares for Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 pretty soon. Very interesting. So we'll get the first tidbits on that

23:30.220 --> 23:35.260
Oh, I'm excited. I'm hopefully Ultramix 3. He said whatever he has so stay tuned to Orange Lounge

23:35.260 --> 23:41.580
But um, we got that and I got a ton of diverse system stuff. We've got you know, lots of fun stuff

23:41.580 --> 23:46.300
All right, we're gonna play one song on this little special show. This is actually from not diverse system

23:46.300 --> 23:49.820

23:49.820 --> 23:58.140

28:50.460 --> 28:53.780
