04:34.519 --> 04:35.459
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, what else is new?

04:36.079 --> 04:37.299
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a nerd lair.

04:37.339 --> 04:38.339
[SPEAKER_18]: There's cords everywhere.

04:38.400 --> 04:38.920
[SPEAKER_18]: Get used to it.

04:41.140 --> 04:42.660
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh yeah, you guys are on wireless tonight.

04:43.441 --> 04:48.502
[SPEAKER_18]: After last week's episode, Bugged finally just brought a... He actually... You went out and bought a wireless router.

04:50.022 --> 04:51.122
[SPEAKER_18]: But he's not donating it to his suit.

04:51.142 --> 04:51.682
[SPEAKER_18]: You gotta... Here.

04:53.783 --> 04:54.063
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

04:54.263 --> 04:55.423
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, give him the mic for a minute.

04:57.343 --> 04:59.464
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, Bugged actually went out and bought a wireless router.

04:59.504 --> 05:00.304
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's going home with me.

05:00.856 --> 05:01.596
[SPEAKER_04]: If you want the old one.

05:02.276 --> 05:03.297
[SPEAKER_18]: You have an old wireless router?

05:03.377 --> 05:03.557
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

05:04.577 --> 05:05.537
[SPEAKER_18]: Heck, maybe I'll take it.

05:05.657 --> 05:06.157
[SPEAKER_18]: I need one.

05:06.477 --> 05:07.798
[SPEAKER_18]: I can get back on Xbox Live.

05:07.858 --> 05:08.698
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, you could.

05:08.718 --> 05:09.758
[SPEAKER_18]: I can get back on Xbox Live.

05:10.478 --> 05:10.658
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

05:10.718 --> 05:12.499
[SPEAKER_18]: You can get that thing that Straight Garrett has.

05:12.839 --> 05:13.039
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe.

05:13.219 --> 05:13.439
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

05:13.659 --> 05:14.859
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't introduced you yet, so shut up.

05:15.239 --> 05:15.499
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

05:16.739 --> 05:17.660
[SPEAKER_18]: Also joining us tonight.

05:17.760 --> 05:19.640
[SPEAKER_15]: Hey, we're still in the middle of my intro.

05:19.660 --> 05:20.260
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you.

05:20.300 --> 05:20.640
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry.

05:20.940 --> 05:22.761
[SPEAKER_18]: What else do you want to intro with tonight?

05:27.262 --> 05:28.162
[SPEAKER_23]: Usually I thought that was my...

05:28.874 --> 05:31.156
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, usually that's your ass, but today it's her mouth.

05:31.256 --> 05:35.719
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, say hello to the one and only Loki, Techmaster, yadda yadda.

05:36.440 --> 05:36.760
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

05:37.060 --> 05:37.481
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

05:38.201 --> 05:38.562
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm good.

05:39.482 --> 05:40.443
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm almost done with the movie.

05:40.964 --> 05:41.244
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost.

05:41.324 --> 05:42.144
[SPEAKER_18]: I have about half an hour left.

05:42.184 --> 05:42.705
[SPEAKER_18]: The movie, yes.

05:42.965 --> 05:48.589
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I gotta... There was a question posted in our podcast forum, but I think I'm gonna answer it on the live show tonight.

05:48.750 --> 05:55.155
[SPEAKER_18]: We're gonna do a little bit of forum feedback tonight on the live show, because I have a question I'm dying to ask you that was posted on the forums this week.

05:55.575 --> 05:58.077
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we'll get to that a little later in the show.

05:59.324 --> 06:00.184
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, alright.

06:00.724 --> 06:04.506
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just thinking about that in regards to your rampant piracy.

06:06.746 --> 06:09.727
[SPEAKER_15]: I downloaded Advent Children in Spanish by accident.

06:12.208 --> 06:12.408
[SPEAKER_15]: Oye!

06:13.388 --> 06:13.868
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.

06:18.269 --> 06:19.250
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why that's so funny.

06:19.310 --> 06:19.610
[SPEAKER_18]: It is.

06:23.311 --> 06:23.651
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

06:25.290 --> 06:30.211
[SPEAKER_18]: Also joining us tonight, say hello to special guest, he already opened his mouth, but once again, say hello to Bugged.

06:30.471 --> 06:30.791
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello.

06:31.211 --> 06:31.691
[SPEAKER_18]: You're back.

06:31.952 --> 06:32.192
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

06:32.432 --> 06:34.192
[SPEAKER_15]: And the specialist guest of them all.

06:36.132 --> 06:36.452
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

06:36.532 --> 06:45.914
[SPEAKER_18]: He's almost like, he's not, I mean, we already have a Techmasa Loki, but Bugged's kind of a tech guy too, so I don't know what we can call him.

06:46.555 --> 06:48.595
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, he's Techmasa 2 or something, I don't know.

06:50.185 --> 06:54.068
[SPEAKER_18]: DietTechMassa, I don't know, MacWhore, MacWhore, I like that.

06:54.528 --> 06:57.570
[SPEAKER_18]: They said, I know bigger MacWhores than Bugged.

06:58.011 --> 07:02.514
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes, but how many MacWhores have a G4 motherboard laying in the middle of their living room right now?

07:02.834 --> 07:08.738
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember, you, sir, used to have a, well, you still do, you have a web server that hangs from the ceiling, right?

07:08.798 --> 07:10.419
[SPEAKER_18]: No, actually, it's inside of a rolling rack.

07:10.520 --> 07:11.120
[SPEAKER_18]: It's still hanging.

07:11.460 --> 07:12.761
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it used to hang from the ceiling.

07:12.881 --> 07:14.002
[SPEAKER_18]: It did hang from the ceiling, yes.

07:14.022 --> 07:14.583
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty awesome.

07:14.623 --> 07:20.507
[SPEAKER_18]: I used to go like, hey, the old Sacramento Bomani player site used to be hosted on Neil's ceiling.

07:20.928 --> 07:21.068
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

07:21.088 --> 07:21.628
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty awesome.

07:22.989 --> 07:27.673
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, that got moved into the inside of a wire rack, so it was zip-tied between layers of wire rack.

07:27.853 --> 07:28.454
[SPEAKER_23]: Zip ties.

07:29.154 --> 07:30.676
[SPEAKER_23]: Zip ties is better.

07:30.696 --> 07:32.037
[SPEAKER_23]: The second best thing next to duct tape.

07:32.397 --> 07:35.479
[SPEAKER_23]: Duct tape and, what was it, duct tape and weed whacker line, that's what I had available.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.861
[SPEAKER_23]: It was really strange.

07:38.702 --> 07:39.142
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

07:40.123 --> 07:40.984
[SPEAKER_23]: Were you a Boy Scout?

07:41.727 --> 07:42.587
[SPEAKER_23]: No, my brother was.

07:42.788 --> 07:43.408
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm just curious.

07:43.508 --> 07:43.808
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

07:44.068 --> 07:45.469
[SPEAKER_15]: I bet you watched lots of MacGyver.

07:46.809 --> 07:47.650
[SPEAKER_23]: Who says I ever stopped?

07:48.990 --> 07:50.591
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't they show reruns of MacGyver still?

07:50.651 --> 07:52.352
[SPEAKER_18]: Two a day.

07:52.632 --> 07:53.953
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that my TiVo doesn't get both.

07:54.373 --> 07:58.735
[SPEAKER_18]: On Megumi's journal, and I know none of you people know who that is, but she's one of... Is she in Step Squad?

07:59.515 --> 07:59.996
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, she is.

08:00.076 --> 08:00.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Megumi's in Step Squad.

08:01.176 --> 08:04.438
[SPEAKER_18]: She posts something MacGyver in her journal like every week.

08:04.738 --> 08:06.839
[SPEAKER_18]: Just to remind me that yes, MacGyver is still cool.

08:08.462 --> 08:08.922
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know.

08:08.942 --> 08:09.843
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why I thought that out.

08:09.863 --> 08:13.645
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, if I want my dose of Richard Dean Anderson, though, I've been going back and watching Stargate, so I'm happy.

08:13.825 --> 08:14.225
[SPEAKER_23]: Whatever.

08:15.366 --> 08:15.826
[SPEAKER_23]: Nerds!

08:17.247 --> 08:18.728
[SPEAKER_23]: Loki actually says that at my front door.

08:20.089 --> 08:21.609
[SPEAKER_17]: Ow, the MacGyver was such a hippie.

08:22.890 --> 08:23.370
[SPEAKER_17]: He was!

08:23.430 --> 08:24.751
[SPEAKER_17]: He was a fucking tree hugger!

08:25.051 --> 08:27.433
[SPEAKER_17]: But he was the most ingenious tree hugger there was.

08:28.153 --> 08:29.914
[SPEAKER_17]: So, um, gotta give him props for that.

08:30.274 --> 08:32.576
[SPEAKER_18]: But he would cut down a tree and then make paper out of it.

08:32.736 --> 08:35.357
[SPEAKER_17]: They should just put MacGyver in Stargate.

08:35.397 --> 08:36.518
[SPEAKER_17]: Just make him a character.

08:37.091 --> 08:39.752
[SPEAKER_17]: And I mean, seriously, it's like, oh, we can't get the Stargate working.

08:39.792 --> 08:48.073
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, like, give me a paperclip and I'll... The Syfy Network needs to just bring back all the cool 80s shows, like MacGyver, Quantum Leap, Holla.

08:48.434 --> 08:48.954
[SPEAKER_23]: Airwolf!

08:49.474 --> 08:49.954
[SPEAKER_18]: Airwolf.

08:50.634 --> 08:52.134
[SPEAKER_18]: Quantum Leap's on every night at 4am.

08:52.815 --> 08:53.715
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it's so badass.

08:53.775 --> 08:54.915
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyway, let's start a show.

08:54.955 --> 08:55.715
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's talk about some games.

08:55.995 --> 09:03.017
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after this quick break, featuring, uh, starting off a brand new track from the, um, V-Rare, the EX2 V-Rare.

09:03.497 --> 09:03.617
[SPEAKER_18]: It's...

09:03.962 --> 09:04.963
[SPEAKER_18]: You gotta move it!

09:05.963 --> 09:06.344
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

09:06.644 --> 09:07.404
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back after this.

10:37.273 --> 10:40.457
[SPEAKER_10]: Let the music fill your cell Let your body take control

11:51.628 --> 11:52.390
Thanks for watching!

15:00.426 --> 15:01.333
Thanks for watching!

16:02.694 --> 16:05.875
[SPEAKER_18]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

16:06.155 --> 16:08.235
[SPEAKER_10]: No!

16:08.435 --> 16:09.095
[SPEAKER_18]: Just kidding.

16:09.535 --> 16:10.576
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio.

16:10.656 --> 16:12.236
[SPEAKER_18]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

16:12.676 --> 16:15.897
[SPEAKER_18]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 156.

16:16.117 --> 16:20.038
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in and listening to this train wreck of a program.

16:20.518 --> 16:22.018
[SPEAKER_18]: We do appreciate your support.

16:23.058 --> 16:27.219
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially when our show is very, very good, as well as when our show is very, very bad.

16:27.499 --> 16:28.479
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate your support.

16:28.819 --> 16:29.399
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never bad.

16:29.599 --> 16:32.320
[SPEAKER_18]: And shows like tonight, which are destined to be very, very mediocre.

16:32.705 --> 16:33.245
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never bad.

16:34.906 --> 16:35.866
[SPEAKER_14]: We're never mediocre.

16:36.106 --> 16:37.027
[SPEAKER_18]: We're baddest and good.

16:37.147 --> 16:38.787
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like, the Power Glove.

16:38.907 --> 16:39.528
[SPEAKER_18]: So bad.

16:40.288 --> 16:40.888
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, like that.

16:41.348 --> 16:42.789
[SPEAKER_15]: We're fabulous, as always.

16:43.489 --> 16:43.989
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

16:44.389 --> 16:45.750
[SPEAKER_15]: With the power of Fiji water.

16:47.811 --> 16:48.771
[SPEAKER_18]: What is up with Fiji water?

16:48.791 --> 16:49.691
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like everywhere now.

16:49.751 --> 16:51.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, it used to be, like, I never saw Fiji water anywhere.

16:51.512 --> 16:52.612
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the only water that doesn't suck.

16:53.473 --> 16:57.194
[SPEAKER_18]: I like... Well, I actually don't like this Arrowhead stuff I've been drinking lately.

16:57.254 --> 16:58.595
[SPEAKER_11]: That stuff tastes like piss.

16:58.675 --> 17:00.555
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't like this Arrowhead drinking water.

17:00.856 --> 17:01.916
[SPEAKER_18]: And people go, like...

17:02.799 --> 17:05.941
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, first off, you buy bottled water.

17:06.021 --> 17:06.861
[SPEAKER_18]: What's wrong with you?

17:06.961 --> 17:08.322
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like the first thing I hear.

17:08.402 --> 17:09.263
[SPEAKER_18]: And then it's like, no, no, no.

17:09.623 --> 17:10.183
[SPEAKER_18]: You don't understand.

17:10.223 --> 17:13.525
[SPEAKER_18]: There really is a difference between all these different brands of bottled water.

17:13.665 --> 17:14.546
[SPEAKER_18]: And you can taste it.

17:14.606 --> 17:15.066
[SPEAKER_18]: You can.

17:15.887 --> 17:20.709
[SPEAKER_18]: If you drink a lot of water, like I do, I drink a shootload of water.

17:20.729 --> 17:22.390
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know why I'm censoring myself tonight.

17:22.450 --> 17:24.091
[SPEAKER_18]: A shootload of water.

17:24.131 --> 17:25.772
[SPEAKER_18]: You could say shitload.

17:26.233 --> 17:26.633
[SPEAKER_18]: I could.

17:26.713 --> 17:27.513
[SPEAKER_18]: I could say shitload.

17:27.553 --> 17:28.094
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the internet.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.314
[SPEAKER_18]: But tonight I'm censoring myself.

17:29.354 --> 17:31.956
[SPEAKER_18]: A shootload of a poo load of water.

17:33.115 --> 17:35.516
[SPEAKER_10]: of water every day at work.

17:35.836 --> 17:43.037
[SPEAKER_18]: Because my job, my day job, I don't talk about my day job a whole lot on this program, but my day job is that I'm a teacher, basically.

17:43.077 --> 17:46.178
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't teach kids, but I teach adults in a professional environment.

17:46.198 --> 17:46.858
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a corporate teacher.

17:46.878 --> 17:47.858
[SPEAKER_15]: Which is almost the same thing.

17:48.438 --> 17:49.198
[SPEAKER_18]: Sometimes.

17:49.658 --> 17:50.719
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not going to knock my job.

17:50.779 --> 17:57.460
[SPEAKER_18]: I love my job, but let's just say that there's challenges that come with teaching children, and there's challenges that come with teaching adults.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.581
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm a corporate trainer, so I do a lot of talking.

18:01.701 --> 18:02.721
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much eight hours a day

18:03.243 --> 18:04.184
[SPEAKER_18]: minus lunch and breaks.

18:04.764 --> 18:08.607
[SPEAKER_18]: So, you know, I have to drink a lot of water or my voice goes.

18:08.687 --> 18:10.949
[SPEAKER_15]: During lunches and breaks, Rob duct tapes his mouth shut.

18:12.110 --> 18:15.252
[SPEAKER_18]: I seriously try not to talk during lunches and breaks to give myself a rest.

18:15.752 --> 18:19.635
[SPEAKER_18]: And I just drink tons and tons of water because that's the only way I can prevent my voice from going out.

18:19.975 --> 18:23.158
[SPEAKER_18]: I should drink more tea, but I can only stand to drink so much tea.

18:23.518 --> 18:25.520
[SPEAKER_18]: And my favorite... Tea is dehydrating.

18:26.620 --> 18:26.861
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it?

18:27.541 --> 18:27.721
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

18:27.941 --> 18:28.802
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's good for your throat.

18:29.605 --> 18:33.609
[SPEAKER_15]: Hot Tea, but that's like if you already have like sign of strangers and stuff.

18:33.749 --> 18:41.435
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's the problem is that my favorite kind of tea is iced tea, and not just any kind of iced tea, but iced green tea is like my favorite kind of tea.

18:41.936 --> 18:44.078
[SPEAKER_18]: But you can't find that anywhere.

18:44.138 --> 18:50.964
[SPEAKER_18]: Like the only time I ever found iced green tea in a bottle was in New York City at a random Rite Aid at Grand Central Station.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.705
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the only place I've ever seen.

18:55.027 --> 18:55.828
[SPEAKER_18]: Did they have green tea?

18:55.848 --> 18:55.908
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

18:56.168 --> 18:56.629
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes.

18:58.766 --> 18:59.367
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

19:15.635 --> 19:19.298
[SPEAKER_15]: instead of like green tea solids mixed with water and crap added.

19:19.418 --> 19:30.466
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, yeah, I know, but the one I had, it was like some type of, and I know this has got to be really exciting for listeners, but I don't care, Lipton like green tea that's diet or something, so it didn't have a lot of sugar.

19:30.646 --> 19:30.947
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

19:31.127 --> 19:31.267
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

19:31.307 --> 19:31.947
[SPEAKER_18]: Where'd you get it?

19:32.127 --> 19:33.508
[SPEAKER_18]: I got it at Food for Less.

19:34.209 --> 19:36.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, my God, I'm so going to Food for Less later on.

19:37.491 --> 19:42.015
[SPEAKER_18]: The one place I've ever seen it is New York City, and I thought, oh, maybe it's an East Coast thing.

19:42.075 --> 19:42.375
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

19:42.395 --> 19:43.216
[SPEAKER_23]: It's like a 24-ounce bottle.

19:43.776 --> 19:44.136
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, weird.

19:44.677 --> 19:44.917
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

19:46.257 --> 19:48.619
[SPEAKER_23]: It's bottled by Pepsi, yeah.

19:48.659 --> 19:49.260
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually surprised.

19:49.300 --> 19:56.405
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually now looking at our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com, click on chat, and they're actually talking about green tea.

19:57.626 --> 19:58.987
[SPEAKER_18]: Arizona green tea, somebody brought up.

19:59.087 --> 20:01.028
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually don't like Arizona green tea for some reason.

20:01.168 --> 20:02.329
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't like that.

20:03.110 --> 20:04.151
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't like Arizona tea.

20:04.191 --> 20:05.492
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I neglected to mention it.

20:05.612 --> 20:08.754
[SPEAKER_18]: So how about video games?

20:08.774 --> 20:09.274
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm sorry.

20:09.294 --> 20:11.376
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm glad there's tea connoisseurs in our chat room as well.

20:12.036 --> 20:13.077
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, how about video games?

20:13.097 --> 20:14.058
[SPEAKER_18]: You should play less of them.

20:14.437 --> 20:14.757
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

20:14.957 --> 20:16.177
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually... Drink more tea.

20:16.197 --> 20:17.378
[SPEAKER_15]: You want to know where I get my tea from?

20:17.558 --> 20:17.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Where?

20:18.498 --> 20:23.339
[SPEAKER_15]: I get it from these little bags that I brew in hot water myself and then ice it if I want it cold.

20:24.519 --> 20:26.799
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, you made me tea the other day when I was visiting.

20:26.939 --> 20:28.180
[SPEAKER_18]: We had some 2DX and tea.

20:28.780 --> 20:29.240
[SPEAKER_15]: Yes, I did.

20:29.360 --> 20:30.540
[SPEAKER_18]: It was like a British thing.

20:30.640 --> 20:31.720
[SPEAKER_18]: We had a little 2DX and tea.

20:31.740 --> 20:34.041
[SPEAKER_15]: No, you had some of my southern style iced tea.

20:34.061 --> 20:37.261
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, it was a little bit of southern style then.

20:37.581 --> 20:38.342
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I see.

20:39.762 --> 20:40.022
God.

20:41.328 --> 20:41.888
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your week?

20:41.908 --> 20:42.409
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

20:42.509 --> 20:43.369
[SPEAKER_18]: How was your day?

21:04.761 --> 21:05.661
[SPEAKER_18]: You fell asleep?

21:06.081 --> 21:06.962
[SPEAKER_15]: During one of our breaks.

21:07.062 --> 21:11.063
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know if you happened to notice, I was curled up sideways on the humongoid chair.

21:11.443 --> 21:11.763
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh-huh.

21:12.563 --> 21:13.724
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember you falling asleep.

21:13.764 --> 21:14.624
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually dozed off.

21:15.124 --> 21:16.804
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember you being really out of it, but I don't remember you.

21:16.824 --> 21:19.625
[SPEAKER_15]: Now, see, earlier that day, I had slept for 13 hours.

21:20.706 --> 21:24.707
[SPEAKER_15]: Came back from my wedding thing and just crashed and didn't get up until 3 the next day.

21:26.727 --> 21:28.788
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, Monday, I get up and go to work.

21:29.508 --> 21:32.269
[SPEAKER_15]: I go back home, go to the doctor, go to the chiropractor.

21:33.544 --> 21:34.665
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm exhausted.

21:35.185 --> 21:37.746
[SPEAKER_15]: Next day, I sleep for another 13 hours.

21:37.846 --> 21:38.947
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd called in, thankfully.

21:39.927 --> 21:42.108
[SPEAKER_15]: Got up, took a shower, sat down for a moment.

21:42.148 --> 21:44.069
[SPEAKER_15]: Next thing I knew, three more hours had passed.

21:44.129 --> 21:47.490
[SPEAKER_15]: No, four more hours had passed, and I was just waking up again.

21:48.911 --> 21:50.952
[SPEAKER_15]: Went to work the next day, fell asleep twice at work.

21:52.093 --> 21:52.613
[SPEAKER_15]: So, yeah.

21:52.673 --> 21:54.794
[SPEAKER_18]: You can get away with falling asleep at work?

21:55.114 --> 21:55.614
[SPEAKER_15]: Yep.

21:55.734 --> 21:56.615
[SPEAKER_18]: That's awesome.

21:56.895 --> 21:57.275
[SPEAKER_15]: Barely.

21:58.306 --> 22:00.348
[SPEAKER_15]: I tell you I was sick though, so they didn't care.

22:00.628 --> 22:01.849
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't fall asleep.

22:02.450 --> 22:08.835
[SPEAKER_18]: Everybody's looking at me, so I can't just suddenly go, okay class, you work on this exercise and I'm going to crawl under the table and take a nap.

22:09.355 --> 22:11.117
[SPEAKER_15]: Remember, take off the bunny ears when you go to work.

22:12.438 --> 22:14.199
[SPEAKER_23]: Okay.

22:14.219 --> 22:14.900
[SPEAKER_15]: Then they won't look at you.

22:15.020 --> 22:17.482
[SPEAKER_23]: That was one of the big pluses to being the boss in a warehouse.

22:17.502 --> 22:23.267
[SPEAKER_23]: You go out and send your minions out to do something and then go crash in the back office for a couple hours while they finish it up.

22:23.940 --> 22:26.842
[SPEAKER_23]: You people, you guys seriously sleep at work?

22:27.302 --> 22:28.423
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, if I was at work, yes.

22:28.443 --> 22:28.783
[SPEAKER_11]: Sometimes.

22:29.603 --> 22:31.364
[SPEAKER_23]: I'd take two, three, four hour lunches.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.366
[SPEAKER_23]: So wait, Bug, you've fallen asleep at work?

22:33.846 --> 22:34.987
[SPEAKER_23]: Uh, yeah, I used to work nights.

22:35.407 --> 22:36.227
[SPEAKER_18]: I'd sleep half the night.

22:36.307 --> 22:38.189
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, you've obviously fallen asleep at work.

22:38.849 --> 22:41.130
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, have you ever slept, taken sleep at work?

22:41.150 --> 22:41.891
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so it's not just me.

22:41.911 --> 22:42.771
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never slept at work.

22:42.891 --> 22:44.232
[SPEAKER_18]: I've never slept at work either.

22:44.492 --> 22:48.955
[SPEAKER_15]: But to my credit, I've only fallen asleep at work when I was sick, and they knew that I was sick.

22:49.495 --> 22:50.776
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm afraid of getting caught.

22:52.026 --> 22:54.647
[SPEAKER_18]: My boss was 13 miles away.

22:54.828 --> 22:56.729
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to have that conversation with my boss.

22:57.450 --> 22:59.371
[SPEAKER_18]: If I get caught falling asleep.

22:59.851 --> 23:01.693
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I'm not in class every day.

23:01.793 --> 23:08.077
[SPEAKER_18]: So feasibly, I could easily go into the room, turn off the lights.

23:08.358 --> 23:09.759
[SPEAKER_14]: I do it the same way I do it at school.

23:11.460 --> 23:12.921
[SPEAKER_14]: We lean over with your hand over your eyes.

23:14.002 --> 23:14.942
[SPEAKER_14]: With your pen in your hand.

23:18.045 --> 23:18.505
[SPEAKER_14]: It works.

23:18.585 --> 23:19.846
[SPEAKER_23]: Everybody's taking notes, right?

23:22.324 --> 23:26.827
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh, so you've never really been caught, except the one time when you were sick?

23:28.028 --> 23:28.768
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I've never been caught.

23:28.908 --> 23:29.569
[SPEAKER_18]: I got caught once.

23:30.089 --> 23:31.470
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd just only done it when I was sick.

23:32.190 --> 23:34.271
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god, what happened when you got caught?

23:35.232 --> 23:37.774
[SPEAKER_23]: They asked me why I was asleep, I said I was asleep.

23:40.856 --> 23:42.757
[SPEAKER_23]: Shit happened the night before, I didn't sleep well.

23:43.137 --> 23:43.837
[SPEAKER_23]: I was tired?

23:44.198 --> 23:44.658
[SPEAKER_23]: Exactly.

23:45.438 --> 23:46.379
[SPEAKER_23]: Did you get written up?

23:47.150 --> 23:47.730
[SPEAKER_23]: I don't remember.

23:47.770 --> 23:49.152
[SPEAKER_23]: They fired my boss the next day.

23:49.192 --> 23:50.593
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, lucky you.

23:52.974 --> 23:59.439
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, it was really odd because the owner of the company I work for also owned another company that we were doing contract work with.

23:59.459 --> 24:03.022
[SPEAKER_23]: It was like a whole big old conflict of interest shit.

24:03.802 --> 24:12.949
[SPEAKER_23]: It's a good old ISP JPS net, but yeah, the data center was located in downtown SAC and everyone else was up in Rockland.

24:12.989 --> 24:15.731
[SPEAKER_23]: I was the only person in downtown SAC and

24:16.260 --> 24:17.701
[SPEAKER_23]: I went into the server room and crashed out.

24:19.362 --> 24:23.065
[SPEAKER_23]: And then the other company brought people through on a tour and I was sitting there snoring away.

24:23.285 --> 24:30.170
[SPEAKER_18]: Hypothetically, in my job, I could easily, easily sneak into one of the training rooms when there's no class going on, turn off the lights, crawl on the table, and go to sleep.

24:30.230 --> 24:31.911
[SPEAKER_18]: And people would just think I'm somewhere else.

24:32.351 --> 24:35.934
[SPEAKER_18]: I could do it, but it's one of those things... Paranoia.

24:36.394 --> 24:36.814
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

24:38.556 --> 24:44.800
[SPEAKER_18]: I work out of paranoia because it's one of those things where I know that the first time I ever did something like that, I'd get caught.

24:45.626 --> 24:45.986
[SPEAKER_18]: www.DarkSakura.com

25:04.685 --> 25:07.926
[SPEAKER_18]: Why aren't you afraid of somebody stealing all the money?

25:08.246 --> 25:11.867
[SPEAKER_18]: And they say, no, because if you have the money out like that, people assume there's a camera on it.

25:11.907 --> 25:15.047
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's honesty by paranoia.

25:17.248 --> 25:18.168
[SPEAKER_18]: And I kind of compare that.

25:18.388 --> 25:20.168
[SPEAKER_18]: See, Loki I see is kind of nodding his head.

25:20.228 --> 25:21.349
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that the same thing for you?

25:21.409 --> 25:23.349
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that you're afraid you're going to get caught?

25:24.749 --> 25:25.169
[SPEAKER_17]: I couldn't.

25:25.249 --> 25:29.230
[SPEAKER_17]: In the work I do, I couldn't even begin to try to fall asleep.

25:29.250 --> 25:31.471
[SPEAKER_17]: There's just too many people around me that would wake me up.

25:31.871 --> 25:32.191
[SPEAKER_18]: I have two.

25:34.395 --> 25:36.917
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been working for this company since 2000.

25:37.037 --> 25:43.722
[SPEAKER_18]: And honestly, I can count the number of times it's happened and it's all been when I was sick or had a migraine.

25:54.437 --> 25:56.259
[SPEAKER_18]: Migraine Surgery.

25:56.299 --> 25:59.103
[SPEAKER_15]: It was always my monitor that gave me my headaches.

25:59.143 --> 26:02.427
[SPEAKER_15]: The same reason why I can't look at a TV and your monitor would give me a headache.

26:03.268 --> 26:04.610
[SPEAKER_15]: Because it's got a rounded screen.

26:05.693 --> 26:08.035
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm actually going to replace this.

26:08.075 --> 26:11.897
[SPEAKER_18]: My next big purchase, I'm going to be replacing this monitor with a flat screen, so be nice.

26:11.977 --> 26:17.441
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no reason to replace my monitor at home because it's a full-size monitor, but it's a flat screen Trinitron.

26:17.761 --> 26:17.941
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

26:18.382 --> 26:19.082
[SPEAKER_18]: Your monitor's pretty nice.

26:19.102 --> 26:20.003
[SPEAKER_15]: My monitor is pretty nice.

26:20.083 --> 26:21.764
[SPEAKER_18]: I like Extifer's monitor, too.

26:22.004 --> 26:23.145
[SPEAKER_15]: His monitor wouldn't make me sick.

26:23.605 --> 26:23.765
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

26:24.065 --> 26:24.766
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand mine.

26:24.886 --> 26:28.088
[SPEAKER_18]: Mine's kind of a weird monitor, but I can't complain because my monitor was free.

26:28.288 --> 26:28.708
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you, Bugged.

26:29.009 --> 26:29.269
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

26:29.629 --> 26:31.050
[SPEAKER_18]: Appreciate it.

26:31.170 --> 26:32.491
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it still have the green stripes on the top?

26:33.454 --> 26:34.935
[SPEAKER_23]: Dan brought home another MMORPG.

26:34.955 --> 26:37.317
[SPEAKER_23]: And he brought home some, like, he brought home Ico.

27:03.988 --> 27:07.611
[SPEAKER_15]: Which I never remembered him liking that game, but he said that he wanted to play it.

27:09.653 --> 27:13.336
[SPEAKER_15]: And I went to Ikea yesterday with my friend Tia.

27:13.536 --> 27:13.996
[SPEAKER_15]: You know Tia.

27:14.417 --> 27:15.157
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course I know Tia.

27:15.197 --> 27:15.658
[SPEAKER_18]: She's a doll.

27:17.219 --> 27:22.443
[SPEAKER_15]: I had owed her a birthday present, so I just took her to Ikea and got her, like, a bunch of stuff for her house.

27:23.884 --> 27:24.585
[SPEAKER_23]: And her new kitty?

27:25.446 --> 27:25.626
[SPEAKER_15]: Huh?

27:26.086 --> 27:26.727
[SPEAKER_23]: And her new kitty?

27:28.908 --> 27:29.689
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, that's right.

27:29.709 --> 27:30.289
[SPEAKER_15]: She has a cat now.

27:30.710 --> 27:30.790
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh.

27:32.133 --> 27:33.474
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't remember about the cat.

27:34.915 --> 27:39.858
[SPEAKER_15]: But we went and picked up my friend Krista, who lives in Berkeley.

27:41.279 --> 27:44.141
[SPEAKER_15]: And we ate really good Indian food.

27:45.282 --> 27:49.785
[SPEAKER_15]: Went down to Ikea, had meatballs, bought stuff, came back.

27:50.665 --> 27:53.647
[SPEAKER_18]: Did anybody go, that's a spicy meatball?

27:53.667 --> 27:55.789
[SPEAKER_15]: These are Swedish meatballs.

27:55.829 --> 27:57.170
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, Swedish, not Italian.

27:57.410 --> 27:57.730
[SPEAKER_23]: Sorry.

27:58.871 --> 27:59.912
[SPEAKER_23]: There was no Mario.

27:59.932 --> 28:00.312
[SPEAKER_23]: No Mario.

28:02.358 --> 28:23.473
[SPEAKER_15]: and then we went to get gelato at this one place in Berkeley that's like got a bajillion flavors I love it's like Naya or something there's a gelato place right by Ikea that is awesome we just went to Berkeley they had like a billion they had like fig flavor and they had amaretto and all kinds of liquor flavors they had aloe vera flavored aloe vera flavored?

28:23.493 --> 28:24.874
[SPEAKER_15]: it was actually supposed to be pretty good

28:26.125 --> 28:27.465
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want to rub it on my sunburn.

28:29.067 --> 28:31.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, aloe vera is actually really good for your digestion.

28:32.389 --> 28:37.332
[SPEAKER_15]: But I had whole grain flavor, which was really yummy.

28:37.372 --> 28:38.733
[SPEAKER_15]: It tasted like cereal and milk.

28:41.375 --> 28:46.138
[SPEAKER_15]: I had this like milk flavor with dark chocolate sprinkles in it.

28:46.919 --> 28:49.301
[SPEAKER_15]: Or not sprinkles, but like swivels in it, but it was all hard.

28:50.061 --> 28:54.004
[SPEAKER_15]: And amaretto, which had real amaretto in it, which was so yummy.

28:55.064 --> 28:56.866
[SPEAKER_15]: and, uh, drove back.

28:57.266 --> 29:01.190
[SPEAKER_15]: And we watched Ring 2 last night, the US one, which is, um, yeah.

29:01.750 --> 29:11.498
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, and then I installed the MMORPG today after doing my Illustrator homework, which I will show the chatroom what I did because I'm so proud that I finally got the freaking pencil right.

29:12.639 --> 29:16.623
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, but I, uh, got an MMORPG today and installed it and played it.

29:17.223 --> 29:17.704
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty cool.

29:17.864 --> 29:19.085
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're going to save that for a little later?

29:20.086 --> 29:22.448
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see what's the big deal, but I'm going to let the chatroom guess...

29:24.423 --> 29:26.124
[SPEAKER_15]: All of them are on my friends list in LiveJournal.

29:48.300 --> 29:51.603
[SPEAKER_23]: and picked that up and then sold back a bunch of games on Wednesday and picked up Burnout 4.

29:52.584 --> 29:55.546
[SPEAKER_23]: Had a couple bucks left over and also picked up Nintendogs.

29:55.686 --> 29:59.630
[SPEAKER_23]: And then I found out that my DS's sound system is completely dead.

30:00.010 --> 30:00.531
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh no.

30:00.651 --> 30:02.292
[SPEAKER_23]: So I've never heard my dog, but it hears me.

30:04.314 --> 30:05.134
[SPEAKER_18]: So it's a mute dog.

30:05.215 --> 30:05.995
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a mute dog.

30:06.416 --> 30:06.856
[SPEAKER_18]: That's nice.

30:07.717 --> 30:09.058
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, just a follow-up to last week's show.

30:09.078 --> 30:11.640
[SPEAKER_18]: For those of you guys that weren't listening last week, there was this big thing.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.642
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody had called us on Skype.

30:13.702 --> 30:13.962
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it

30:14.778 --> 30:23.863
[SPEAKER_18]: Ron Chan, I think, called us on Skype and said that he had heard something on the internet that there was a Target in some area that was selling We Heart Katamari early.

30:23.943 --> 30:25.463
[SPEAKER_18]: So I don't know where this idea came from.

30:25.503 --> 30:27.744
[SPEAKER_18]: We just said, well, because it was going back and forth.

30:27.784 --> 30:29.745
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, oh, no, it's a Photoshop.

30:29.826 --> 30:30.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Or, yeah, they were selling it early.

30:30.986 --> 30:34.208
[SPEAKER_18]: So we said, well, just freaking call them and see if they have one in stock.

30:34.248 --> 30:42.812
[SPEAKER_18]: And sure enough, when we called them, we all were kind of, at least I know when I was calling them, I was expecting the guy to say, no, we don't have that game or to know nothing about it.

30:43.206 --> 30:47.549
[SPEAKER_18]: But we kind of got surprised because when we called the Target and asked the guy, he said, yeah, there's one left on the shelf.

30:48.050 --> 30:52.593
[SPEAKER_18]: So that kind of started this whole like, oh, shit, wave of, oh, shit, call Target.

30:52.633 --> 30:53.353
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell is going on?

30:54.074 --> 30:58.537
[SPEAKER_18]: So sure enough, Bug, you had, now you found a copy of We Heart Katamari in the air.

30:58.557 --> 30:58.917
[SPEAKER_18]: And bought it.

30:59.518 --> 31:04.361
[SPEAKER_18]: And I went to, now one of the Target stores you called on break was the one in Roseville.

31:04.501 --> 31:04.661
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

31:04.822 --> 31:06.143
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that far from Golf Land.

31:06.303 --> 31:06.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

31:07.550 --> 31:16.655
[SPEAKER_18]: I actually went out there Tuesday and asked if they had any We Heart Katamari because I didn't see any on the shelf and I asked because they said when you called them they were going to put them out on the shelves that Tuesday, right?

31:16.755 --> 31:17.095
[SPEAKER_18]: They didn't.

31:17.776 --> 31:19.877
[SPEAKER_18]: And the guy said, no, we don't have that game.

31:20.077 --> 31:22.098
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost he knew what I was trying to do.

31:22.558 --> 31:30.122
[SPEAKER_18]: So I think some of the Target employees caught on because somehow there was this whole underground wave on the internet like, check Target, check Target.

31:30.662 --> 31:32.683
[SPEAKER_18]: None of the major gaming sites picked this up.

31:32.923 --> 31:35.725
[SPEAKER_18]: None of them picked it up that We Heart Katamari got leaked early.

31:36.331 --> 31:41.452
[SPEAKER_18]: But somehow it was spreading on the down low, and I'd like to think we had something to do with that.

31:41.492 --> 31:41.753
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki?

31:42.333 --> 31:45.554
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, you see, here's what happened with the whole Tuesday thing.

31:46.674 --> 31:50.755
[SPEAKER_17]: Apparently, what happened was Namco accidentally, one of the shipments, got sent out.

31:51.575 --> 31:57.477
[SPEAKER_17]: They knew who exactly, too, that those got shipped to, and so when they found out,

31:58.154 --> 32:02.397
[SPEAKER_17]: Thanks to me, Mr. Snitch, that stores had leaked it.

32:02.917 --> 32:07.400
[SPEAKER_17]: They got on the phone and they reprimanded people.

32:08.341 --> 32:08.761
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

32:08.821 --> 32:11.543
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, this was an email that you wrote to Namco.

32:11.583 --> 32:13.244
[SPEAKER_17]: The head of sales from Namco.

32:13.264 --> 32:16.847
[SPEAKER_18]: So, thank you for ruining our fun, you bastard.

32:16.907 --> 32:19.668
[SPEAKER_17]: It's only a couple copies that were leaked.

32:19.889 --> 32:21.890
[SPEAKER_17]: Probably everyone already bought those copies.

32:21.950 --> 32:24.031
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, we're talking like one shipment, one box.

32:24.212 --> 32:24.232
[SPEAKER_18]: I...

32:25.373 --> 32:26.594
[SPEAKER_18]: I think Namco downplayed it too.

32:43.123 --> 32:47.446
[SPEAKER_15]: There was another one in the center of the country, another one on the east coast.

32:47.606 --> 32:48.687
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we know there was one in Kansas.

32:48.707 --> 32:53.330
[SPEAKER_17]: Speculate what you want, but this is straight from the head of sales at Namco.

32:53.650 --> 32:55.432
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, we all know corporations are full of bullshit.

32:55.512 --> 32:58.514
[SPEAKER_18]: I understand that, but I think they were BSing you in your first response.

32:58.574 --> 33:00.435
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that they were trying to downplay what happened.

33:00.455 --> 33:01.096
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, guess what?

33:01.156 --> 33:03.998
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually released some more games that haven't even come out yet.

33:04.038 --> 33:06.239
[SPEAKER_17]: Namco X Capcom is in stores right now.

33:06.459 --> 33:06.760
[SPEAKER_17]: Is it?

33:07.240 --> 33:07.900
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not.

33:08.441 --> 33:09.001
[SPEAKER_17]: Bastard.

33:09.662 --> 33:10.222
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just saying.

33:14.473 --> 33:19.096
[SPEAKER_15]: They may say whatever they want to, but we've got irrefutable proof that they lied.

33:20.957 --> 33:22.058
[SPEAKER_18]: Chat room comments.

33:22.838 --> 33:23.218
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see.

33:23.298 --> 33:24.219
[SPEAKER_18]: Comments about Loki.

33:24.339 --> 33:25.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki, you fucking narc.

33:25.820 --> 33:26.841
[SPEAKER_18]: Snitch, you whore.

33:27.281 --> 33:28.582
[SPEAKER_18]: You're a mean one, Mr. Snitch.

33:28.662 --> 33:29.722
[SPEAKER_18]: You piece of shit, Loki.

33:29.762 --> 33:30.723
[SPEAKER_18]: You ruined Christmas.

33:31.063 --> 33:31.924
[SPEAKER_18]: You whore, slut.

33:31.944 --> 33:32.744
[SPEAKER_18]: You ruined Hanukkah.

33:32.984 --> 33:33.765
[SPEAKER_18]: Honky-ass bitch.

33:35.026 --> 33:36.527
[SPEAKER_17]: It ruined shit, okay?

33:36.587 --> 33:37.408
[SPEAKER_17]: Let me put it this way.

33:37.828 --> 33:41.871
[SPEAKER_17]: If those games would have been on the store shelves anyways, then they would have already been bought up, okay?

33:42.351 --> 33:44.512
[SPEAKER_17]: And if they weren't already, then you know what?

33:44.913 --> 33:48.035
[SPEAKER_17]: Don't blame me, because it's those retarded people who put it out in the first place.

33:48.995 --> 33:51.337
[SPEAKER_17]: You shouldn't even have your game yet, so shut up.

33:51.837 --> 33:52.838
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what I have to say about that.

33:53.613 --> 33:56.514
[SPEAKER_18]: And a related note, I actually got to play We Heart Katamari today, thank you guys.

33:56.554 --> 34:00.734
[SPEAKER_17]: If you really want your stupid game early, go fucking pirate it off the internet like everybody else does.

34:01.174 --> 34:02.155
[SPEAKER_17]: And save yourself the $40.

34:02.715 --> 34:12.156
[SPEAKER_18]: That's what it's really about, is that you don't want people stepping on your territory of the rampant BitTorrent piracy ring or whatever.

34:12.437 --> 34:13.777
[SPEAKER_17]: BitTorrent was last week, man.

34:14.397 --> 34:16.337
[SPEAKER_15]: It's all about newsgroups.

34:16.717 --> 34:19.318
[SPEAKER_15]: Newsgroups are older than old and never went away.

34:22.359 --> 34:23.420
[SPEAKER_15]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

34:36.680 --> 34:38.161
[SPEAKER_15]: We played it at E3.

34:38.801 --> 34:40.022
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, and the E3 one rocked.

34:40.062 --> 34:45.185
[SPEAKER_18]: But here's my thing, is that I don't understand Japanese at all, and I'm not going to learn it.

34:45.305 --> 34:46.966
[SPEAKER_18]: So I need an English version.

34:46.986 --> 34:50.248
[SPEAKER_15]: I know 30 kanji, which isn't enough to read all the dialogue in that game.

34:51.108 --> 34:52.369
[SPEAKER_15]: So it doesn't matter.

34:52.449 --> 34:59.993
[SPEAKER_15]: The king of all cosmos is going to say something fabulous, his package is going to rule the world, and you're going to roll a bunch of shit up in a big ball, big whoop.

35:00.053 --> 35:00.474
[SPEAKER_15]: What's new?

35:02.035 --> 35:02.295
[SPEAKER_17]: Fine.

35:02.615 --> 35:04.436
[SPEAKER_17]: Besides, Burnout 4 came out, and that was...

35:05.265 --> 35:07.986
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I want to let Bugged finish what was going on with his week.

35:08.027 --> 35:10.448
[SPEAKER_18]: However, I do want to end on one note here.

35:10.708 --> 35:15.530
[SPEAKER_18]: Legend of Zaku says, Remember Loki, snitches get stitches for being bitches.

35:16.551 --> 35:17.231
[SPEAKER_18]: Just remember that.

35:19.513 --> 35:21.013
[SPEAKER_18]: Bugged, how was the rest of your week?

35:21.634 --> 35:22.774
[SPEAKER_23]: Burnout 4 is also awesome.

35:25.536 --> 35:27.257
[SPEAKER_23]: And that was pretty much my damn week.

35:29.078 --> 35:30.518
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, Loki, how was your week?

35:30.558 --> 35:31.199
[SPEAKER_17]: How was your day?

35:31.979 --> 35:33.160
[SPEAKER_17]: My week started off good.

35:33.180 --> 35:33.220
[SPEAKER_17]: Um,

35:34.625 --> 35:43.310
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, first off, I had, you know, Advent Children, like, the hour after the show ended.

35:44.591 --> 35:45.372
[SPEAKER_17]: I had to watch it.

35:46.269 --> 35:48.690
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I had to watch it, but I didn't get to watch it.

35:48.810 --> 35:52.111
[SPEAKER_17]: Instead, I watched most of the action sequences over the course of the week.

35:52.251 --> 35:55.613
[SPEAKER_17]: Until Wednesday, and that's when I got Burnout Revenge.

35:56.693 --> 35:59.954
[SPEAKER_17]: And then we just crashed into cars the rest of the week.

36:00.755 --> 36:04.616
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I finally got to watch Advent Children today, the entire thing.

36:04.796 --> 36:07.798
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't know why Sony is not putting this in theaters.

36:09.038 --> 36:12.259
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like 100% better than a lot of this shit out there.

36:12.740 --> 36:13.700
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though it has no plot?

36:14.471 --> 36:15.871
[SPEAKER_17]: and Spirits Within.

36:15.891 --> 36:19.253
[SPEAKER_17]: It has a plot and if you pay attention to the plot you would know that.

36:20.453 --> 36:29.436
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I watched the whole thing all the way through the first time I watched it and actually could follow the dialogue without subtitles and the plot was so weak you could see right through it.

36:32.057 --> 36:32.477
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

36:34.017 --> 36:35.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Miss Bitter, just call her a bitch.

36:36.960 --> 36:37.840
[SPEAKER_18]: Fucking bitch!

36:38.900 --> 36:39.881
[SPEAKER_18]: Now call him a bastard.

36:39.901 --> 36:42.481
[SPEAKER_18]: Call him a fucking asshole, come on.

36:42.601 --> 36:44.342
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, you stop it there!

36:45.462 --> 36:47.102
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I like to think that I'm an adult, thank you.

36:49.343 --> 36:51.543
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, I'm not, so I'll stoop that low now.

36:52.063 --> 36:54.244
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, no, it was actually really kickass.

36:55.404 --> 36:58.565
[SPEAKER_17]: Plot or not, I mean, come on, it's better than ooey bullshit.

36:59.025 --> 36:59.245
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean...

37:00.647 --> 37:01.548
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki does have a point.

37:01.708 --> 37:03.069
[SPEAKER_18]: At least it didn't have a rave in it.

37:05.370 --> 37:06.431
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't even watched it yet.

37:06.471 --> 37:07.792
[SPEAKER_18]: I have to say he does have a point.

37:07.832 --> 37:09.113
[SPEAKER_18]: It wasn't directed by Uwe Boll.

37:09.873 --> 37:10.133
[SPEAKER_11]: True.

37:11.014 --> 37:16.758
[SPEAKER_15]: I just... Without spoiling anything, it is true.

37:17.178 --> 37:18.019
[SPEAKER_15]: There was a plot.

37:18.099 --> 37:21.081
[SPEAKER_15]: However, it was highly transparent and very obvious from the beginning.

37:21.801 --> 37:23.903
[SPEAKER_15]: So I don't put much merit in that.

37:23.983 --> 37:26.364
[SPEAKER_15]: It's eye candy and it's for the fans is all it is.

37:26.564 --> 37:27.025
[SPEAKER_18]: Was it pretty?

37:27.845 --> 37:29.046
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, yeah, it was pretty.

37:30.445 --> 37:34.668
[SPEAKER_15]: and I'm going to say this off microphone real quick.

37:34.688 --> 37:37.590
[SPEAKER_09]: It's all about motorcycle races, okay?

37:37.630 --> 37:39.251
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright, okay.

37:39.631 --> 37:47.837
[SPEAKER_15]: But yeah, it was very, no, I'm not saying it was bad at all, but it did have a really weak plot, I'm sorry.

37:48.397 --> 37:50.138
[SPEAKER_18]: Which was better, Advent Children or Spirits Within?

37:50.158 --> 37:50.759
[SPEAKER_18]: Spirits Within.

37:51.718 --> 37:55.859
[SPEAKER_15]: Wolf Spirits Within, I can't really call Final Fantasy because it wasn't, number one, wasn't a game.

37:56.319 --> 37:57.360
[SPEAKER_15]: Number two, didn't feel like it.

37:57.440 --> 38:00.240
[SPEAKER_15]: It's basically, hi, this is really pretty CG by Square.

38:01.781 --> 38:03.981
[SPEAKER_18]: And that's what they should have called the movie, and I bet it would have done better.

38:04.021 --> 38:05.362
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was a good movie on its own.

38:05.542 --> 38:06.662
[SPEAKER_15]: It just wasn't Final Fantasy.

38:06.742 --> 38:07.022
[SPEAKER_18]: It was.

38:07.042 --> 38:08.283
[SPEAKER_15]: That was just like the bouncer.

38:08.363 --> 38:10.043
[SPEAKER_17]: Hi, this is a pretty game by Square.

38:11.904 --> 38:16.325
[SPEAKER_18]: They should have just marketed it as not a Final Fantasy movie, as, you know, pretty CG.

38:16.345 --> 38:17.405
[SPEAKER_17]: Just called the Spirits Within.

38:17.425 --> 38:17.525
[SPEAKER_17]: Alien 5.

38:17.645 --> 38:17.925
[SPEAKER_18]: Alien 5.

38:21.445 --> 38:23.466
[SPEAKER_17]: You know they're going to probably make something like that too.

38:23.566 --> 38:24.907
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, sorry, you're weak in your day.

38:25.387 --> 38:29.250
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, other than that, didn't do a whole lot.

38:29.370 --> 38:31.511
[SPEAKER_17]: Just trying to play some other games.

38:31.931 --> 38:38.195
[SPEAKER_17]: I almost got to play Graffiti Kingdom, even though I bought that like weeks ago.

38:38.675 --> 38:38.995
[SPEAKER_17]: Almost.

38:41.437 --> 38:43.538
[SPEAKER_17]: But yeah, I got a bunch of games I'm trying out.

38:43.698 --> 38:45.899
[SPEAKER_17]: So like Urban Rain, it's going to be sweet.

38:47.120 --> 38:50.722
[SPEAKER_17]: They actually have, what is it, Paul Phoenix and Law from Tekken 5 in it.

38:51.295 --> 38:52.176
[SPEAKER_17]: Final Fantasy XI

39:14.113 --> 39:18.784
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, I will never play Final Fantasy XI that long again.

39:19.165 --> 39:22.533
[SPEAKER_18]: And Loki, you'll be pleased to know another mission was accomplished without you.

39:23.399 --> 39:27.000
[SPEAKER_17]: I keep trying to play, and goddammit, the woman keeps pulling me away.

39:27.700 --> 39:29.301
[SPEAKER_17]: But at least this time it was for a good reason.

39:29.321 --> 39:30.721
[SPEAKER_17]: She got her fucking car, finally.

39:30.941 --> 39:31.461
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, congratulations.

39:31.481 --> 39:32.502
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't drive her around anymore.

39:32.742 --> 39:35.702
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm done driving an hour, or two hours a day.

39:35.802 --> 39:36.583
[SPEAKER_17]: Driving Miss Nelly?

39:37.163 --> 39:38.023
[SPEAKER_17]: Driving Miss Nelly.

39:38.223 --> 39:38.603
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright.

39:38.963 --> 39:40.704
[SPEAKER_17]: So, I'm done with that, thank god.

39:40.784 --> 39:44.125
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying to get back to Final Fantasy XI.

39:44.165 --> 39:45.585
[SPEAKER_17]: It's friggin' hard.

39:45.625 --> 39:47.166
[SPEAKER_17]: There's too much stuff I have to do.

39:47.806 --> 39:48.686
[SPEAKER_18]: We can still help you with it.

39:49.646 --> 39:57.512
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to be able to sit down Saturdays and just play, or set a day to play, but it's just not working out that way.

39:58.113 --> 40:01.595
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't do a marathon like that on that game ever again.

40:01.635 --> 40:03.256
[SPEAKER_18]: It was so exhausting.

40:03.797 --> 40:12.363
[SPEAKER_15]: When I was unemployed, I played Ragnarok for a total of, what was it, 38 hours straight.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.344
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my lord.

40:13.824 --> 40:14.485
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I have some

40:15.031 --> 40:16.052
[SPEAKER_17]: Days off here.

40:16.272 --> 40:16.872
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't sleep.

40:17.093 --> 40:18.634
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my gosh, you people are sick.

40:19.034 --> 40:20.315
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't play a video game that long.

40:20.735 --> 40:24.278
[SPEAKER_15]: Although I have done several days straight staying logged in because I would vend at night.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.460
[SPEAKER_15]: And while I was at work, when I started working in.

40:32.704 --> 40:33.945
[SPEAKER_18]: So the rest of my week and my day...

40:36.601 --> 40:47.270
[SPEAKER_18]: Pretty much, I picked up, I'm going to talk about some of these games on the podcast, but I also picked up a copy of Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks, because it was a game that I played at E3 that I liked, surprisingly, a lot more than I thought I would.

40:47.310 --> 40:48.050
[SPEAKER_17]: Wait, wait, wait, hold on.

40:48.151 --> 40:49.111
[SPEAKER_17]: You picked up that game?

40:49.372 --> 40:49.592
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

40:50.993 --> 40:51.373
[SPEAKER_18]: From where?

40:52.774 --> 40:53.155
[SPEAKER_18]: Best Buy.

40:53.255 --> 40:53.435
[SPEAKER_18]: Why?

40:54.115 --> 40:55.617
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't come out until next week!

40:55.897 --> 40:57.118
[SPEAKER_18]: It came out early.

40:57.178 --> 40:59.300
[SPEAKER_18]: It's on GameStop's site as being out now, too.

40:59.740 --> 41:00.781
[SPEAKER_18]: Eh, fucking GameStop.

41:01.622 --> 41:01.822
[SPEAKER_18]: So...

41:03.073 --> 41:03.734
[SPEAKER_18]: Did I really get it?

41:03.834 --> 41:05.535
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get a copy of Mortal Kombat Shell amongst early.

41:05.555 --> 41:06.696
[SPEAKER_18]: It's out everywhere, isn't it?

41:07.256 --> 41:07.396
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

41:07.996 --> 41:08.236
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

41:08.537 --> 41:09.017
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't think so.

41:09.257 --> 41:09.757
[SPEAKER_18]: I think so.

41:10.098 --> 41:10.938
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at GameStop's site.

41:10.958 --> 41:11.919
[SPEAKER_18]: It says it came out last week.

41:12.559 --> 41:13.700
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, GameStop's wrong.

41:17.623 --> 41:22.065
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, well... I'll have to check into that, because... You know... Are you going to snitch on them, too?

41:22.085 --> 41:23.346
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you going to snitch on Best Buy now?

41:23.646 --> 41:28.209
[SPEAKER_17]: No, that means that our Dallas facility is wrong, and... Well, no.

41:28.329 --> 41:28.550
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

41:29.310 --> 41:30.070
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

41:30.151 --> 41:32.252
[SPEAKER_17]: I really don't care, you know, because...

41:32.751 --> 41:33.451
[SPEAKER_17]: And Richard O'Brien!

41:33.471 --> 41:33.612
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes!

41:33.632 --> 41:33.832
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway.

42:02.964 --> 42:04.066
[SPEAKER_18]: So, I like Mortal Kombat.

42:04.086 --> 42:08.071
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's got a pretty interesting story to it, and the game's actually kind of fun, so I'm going to talk about that.

42:08.091 --> 42:10.835
[SPEAKER_18]: But it does have flaws, but I'll talk about that on the podcast.

42:10.915 --> 42:13.037
[SPEAKER_18]: Otherwise, not a whole lot else to my week.

42:13.198 --> 42:14.039
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been pretty boring.

42:14.259 --> 42:16.362
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't done anything that special, so that's me.

42:17.222 --> 42:19.444
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, by the way, I watched the movie Birth last night.

42:19.624 --> 42:20.504
[SPEAKER_17]: That movie sucks.

42:20.785 --> 42:23.667
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, is that the one with Nicole Kidman fucking a 12-year-old or something?

42:23.687 --> 42:24.848
[SPEAKER_17]: She doesn't fuck a 12-year-old.

42:25.508 --> 42:26.609
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a 10-year-old, for one.

42:26.969 --> 42:27.890
[SPEAKER_17]: And she doesn't fuck him.

42:28.450 --> 42:31.112
[SPEAKER_17]: She does take a bath with him.

42:31.512 --> 42:33.254
[SPEAKER_17]: Or I should say, he gets in the bath with her.

42:34.114 --> 42:37.096
[SPEAKER_17]: And she kisses him, and that's about it.

42:37.617 --> 42:39.678
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was fucking boring.

42:40.099 --> 42:40.919
[SPEAKER_18]: Does it have a tongue?

42:41.940 --> 42:42.620
[SPEAKER_17]: I guess.

42:42.881 --> 42:44.442
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't show it.

42:44.922 --> 42:46.103
[SPEAKER_17]: So there's a ton of scenes with

42:46.812 --> 42:49.174
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

43:11.524 --> 43:11.764
[SPEAKER_18]: No.

43:11.784 --> 43:13.045
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just a movie with Bjork in it.

43:13.085 --> 43:13.645
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, don't get me wrong.

43:13.685 --> 43:27.533
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Bjork and I love Dance from the Dark, actually, but it's so pretentious because, like, the first four minutes of the movie is just music playing like a symphony and all just paintings dissolving into one another.

43:27.593 --> 43:28.133
[SPEAKER_18]: Just paintings.

43:28.213 --> 43:29.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Pictures of paintings for four minutes.

43:30.715 --> 43:32.035
[SPEAKER_17]: That's nothing to do with the movie.

43:32.596 --> 43:33.036
[SPEAKER_18]: Exactly.

43:33.056 --> 43:35.077
[SPEAKER_18]: It has nothing to do... Well, it kind of does...

43:35.649 --> 43:42.773
[SPEAKER_18]: You could say it does, because it's about her going blind, and so, you know, paintings get it, because, you know, when you're blind, you can't see paintings.

43:44.394 --> 43:44.774
[SPEAKER_18]: But anyway.

43:45.294 --> 43:48.316
[SPEAKER_17]: So she sings crappy music instead?

43:50.377 --> 43:54.519
[SPEAKER_18]: No, but there's this one thing where she's singing about everything in the factory, and she's like, Boom!

43:54.680 --> 43:55.060
[SPEAKER_18]: Crash!

43:55.140 --> 43:55.640
[SPEAKER_18]: Skitty!

43:55.680 --> 43:56.040
[SPEAKER_18]: Boom!

43:56.100 --> 43:57.281
[SPEAKER_18]: Crash!

43:58.562 --> 44:00.663
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, I would throw her into a machine.

44:00.743 --> 44:02.664
[SPEAKER_18]: I love Bjork, because she's crazy.

44:06.047 --> 44:06.347
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

44:07.468 --> 44:07.708
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway.

44:08.028 --> 44:10.669
[SPEAKER_11]: I love Margaret Cho's impression of Bjork.

44:13.351 --> 44:18.313
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.

44:18.373 --> 44:20.094
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't do it.

44:20.194 --> 44:23.456
[SPEAKER_18]: What was that dinosaur in Jurassic Park?

44:23.676 --> 44:25.117
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember that killed the guy in the car?

44:25.157 --> 44:25.837
[SPEAKER_18]: Not the raptor.

44:25.857 --> 44:26.797
[SPEAKER_18]: Dilophosaurus.

44:26.817 --> 44:27.638
[SPEAKER_18]: Dilophosaurus.

44:28.820 --> 44:34.103
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember, the postman on Seinfeld was in Jurassic Park, right?

44:34.424 --> 44:34.864
[SPEAKER_15]: Newman!

44:35.064 --> 44:35.384
[SPEAKER_18]: Newman!

44:35.544 --> 44:36.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Newman was in Jurassic Park.

44:36.585 --> 44:38.546
[SPEAKER_15]: I didn't watch Seinfeld because that show was lame.

44:39.207 --> 44:41.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, forget it then.

44:42.568 --> 44:43.629
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm talking to a wall.

44:44.430 --> 44:45.270
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, no, go ahead.

44:46.151 --> 44:47.631
[SPEAKER_15]: I just don't know who you're talking about.

44:47.772 --> 44:49.092
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, there's a scene in Jurassic Park.

44:49.132 --> 44:52.394
[SPEAKER_18]: He was the big fat guy with the glasses that was kind of the bad guy.

44:53.015 --> 44:53.415
[SPEAKER_04]: The lawyer?

44:53.435 --> 44:53.515
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

44:54.099 --> 44:55.079
[SPEAKER_18]: He wasn't the lawyer.

44:55.859 --> 44:57.600
[SPEAKER_18]: He was the computer programmer.

44:57.660 --> 44:59.040
[SPEAKER_18]: He took the security systems down.

44:59.280 --> 45:00.881
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember him.

45:01.121 --> 45:02.701
[SPEAKER_18]: Was Nedry, was that his name in the movie?

45:02.721 --> 45:03.021
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes.

45:03.061 --> 45:04.181
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, his name was Nedry in the movie.

45:04.281 --> 45:04.781
[SPEAKER_18]: I read the book.

45:04.841 --> 45:06.582
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, well, it was the same thing in the book.

45:07.062 --> 45:20.565
[SPEAKER_18]: And he's running away, trying to escape, and the power goes out at that point or whatever, and then the dinosaur comes up to him in the car, and it's going, and it's so cute, and he's like,

45:20.942 --> 45:34.169
[SPEAKER_18]: and then he's like, hi guy, go away or something and then I think he throws a rock at the dinosaur or something and the dinosaur goes and then spits on him and tears out his intestines or whatever dinosaurs do.

45:34.689 --> 45:35.530
[SPEAKER_11]: Ew, intestines.

45:35.550 --> 45:35.770
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

45:37.370 --> 45:37.991
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh my god.

45:38.311 --> 45:40.292
[SPEAKER_17]: I did have to laugh when the dinosaur got in his car.

45:41.833 --> 45:43.614
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, the dinosaur like hops in his car and eats him.

45:44.414 --> 45:44.854
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cool.

45:45.955 --> 45:49.997
[SPEAKER_15]: I did like the Jurassic Park 3 was horrible but it did have funny scenes in it.

45:50.444 --> 45:51.384
[SPEAKER_18]: I never saw Jurassic Park 3.

45:52.324 --> 45:53.425
[SPEAKER_15]: Like at the very end.

45:53.605 --> 45:56.725
[SPEAKER_17]: What about Jurassic Park 2 with the chick that does the gymnastics?

45:56.826 --> 45:57.766
[SPEAKER_17]: That was laughable.

45:58.746 --> 46:03.747
[SPEAKER_15]: But in the third one, there's a scene with the mama trying to soar in her baby.

46:04.507 --> 46:06.428
[SPEAKER_15]: And the guy's like trapped in the thing.

46:07.588 --> 46:08.908
[SPEAKER_15]: And he's like the bad guy.

46:08.928 --> 46:10.649
[SPEAKER_15]: So she nudges the baby.

46:10.709 --> 46:11.189
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

46:11.329 --> 46:12.129
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead and eat him.

46:12.469 --> 46:13.029
[SPEAKER_15]: Go ahead.

46:13.549 --> 46:15.010
[SPEAKER_15]: And the baby goes, okay, mommy.

46:15.130 --> 46:15.610
[SPEAKER_15]: Rawr!

46:16.790 --> 46:17.410
[SPEAKER_15]: That was funny.

46:18.291 --> 46:19.831
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it true they're making a Jurassic Park 4 movie?

46:21.457 --> 46:22.738
[SPEAKER_17]: I have to see them laugh at it.

46:23.098 --> 46:23.679
[SPEAKER_17]: It's over.

46:23.799 --> 46:24.520
[SPEAKER_17]: It's over, people.

46:24.560 --> 46:26.221
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's on Mainland now.

46:27.662 --> 46:33.087
[SPEAKER_18]: That was the worst part of Jurassic Park 2, was when it was like San Diego gets invaded with Velociraptors.

46:33.147 --> 46:37.811
[SPEAKER_17]: Or they can find maybe another island that they didn't know about that they're doing a third Jurassic Park in.

46:37.831 --> 46:39.712
[SPEAKER_17]: It's like, oh, we didn't know about that one.

46:41.594 --> 46:45.277
[SPEAKER_23]: Or bring Jeff Goldblum back to life again.

46:45.417 --> 46:48.600
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, well, just read the book.

46:50.373 --> 46:51.915
[SPEAKER_15]: The book was actually really, really good.

46:52.976 --> 46:58.722
[SPEAKER_17]: I think Jurassic Park should be like the dinosaurs attack Euro Disney or something like that.

47:00.203 --> 47:01.905
[SPEAKER_15]: Battle Royale versus Jurassic Park.

47:02.265 --> 47:04.047
[SPEAKER_17]: Or how about that new Hong Kong Disney?

47:05.489 --> 47:06.430
[SPEAKER_17]: Better idea for a movie.

47:06.470 --> 47:09.373
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll have Tony Jai versus the dinosaurs.

47:09.613 --> 47:10.634
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll just have them take them out.

47:10.654 --> 47:11.575
[SPEAKER_17]: Can Vin Diesel be in it?

47:12.543 --> 47:13.243
[SPEAKER_17]: He can get eaten.

47:13.964 --> 47:18.406
[SPEAKER_17]: He can be like the Steven Seagal character in Executive Decision.

47:18.526 --> 47:19.987
[SPEAKER_18]: Is Steven Seagal still making movies?

47:20.487 --> 47:21.168
[SPEAKER_18]: Unfortunately, yes.

47:21.208 --> 47:23.609
[SPEAKER_18]: Dude, who is a Steven Seagal fan anymore?

47:24.849 --> 47:25.350
[SPEAKER_18]: The Midwest.

47:26.890 --> 47:27.811
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm serious.

47:27.831 --> 47:29.712
[SPEAKER_18]: Just the whole lot of them.

47:29.852 --> 47:30.672
[SPEAKER_18]: The whole Midwest.

47:31.933 --> 47:34.034
[SPEAKER_17]: They're the people that still buy the Van Damme movies.

47:34.534 --> 47:35.975
[SPEAKER_17]: And yes, he's still making movies.

47:36.816 --> 47:37.716
[SPEAKER_17]: It's all being movies now.

47:37.736 --> 47:39.097
[SPEAKER_17]: Guile's still making movies?

47:40.475 --> 47:44.542
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, he wasn't satisfied enough killing off fucking Raul Julia, but no!

47:44.563 --> 47:46.486
[SPEAKER_17]: Gotta keep making more crappy movies!

47:47.107 --> 47:50.133
[SPEAKER_15]: I feel so bad for Raul Julia, for that being his last movie.

47:50.507 --> 47:50.807
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

47:50.967 --> 47:55.050
[SPEAKER_18]: Technically, he had another thing on HBO that he won a lot of awards for.

47:55.511 --> 47:57.532
[SPEAKER_18]: So he had that HBO thing.

47:57.692 --> 47:58.893
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, sort of the redemption thing.

47:58.913 --> 48:01.495
[SPEAKER_17]: If only someone could go back in time and tell him not to make that movie.

48:02.716 --> 48:03.716
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a bad idea.

48:03.836 --> 48:09.440
[SPEAKER_18]: But remember that the Street Fighter movie came out when we were all like in what, like 7th grade-ish?

48:09.480 --> 48:11.002
[SPEAKER_18]: I think I was in 7th grade, right?

48:12.342 --> 48:14.804
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it was like 1990 when that movie came out, right?

48:14.904 --> 48:17.286
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was like, you know, you go and see it and you're like,

48:17.898 --> 48:18.880
[SPEAKER_18]: What the hell is this?

48:18.960 --> 48:23.148
[SPEAKER_15]: I actually remembered liking it when I was younger, and I saw it four times in the theater.

48:24.010 --> 48:28.979
[SPEAKER_15]: Wow, I remember... I had an obsession with Jean-Claude Van Damme when I was younger.

48:30.086 --> 48:31.267
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

48:53.960 --> 48:59.184
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I went and saw Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2, The Secret of the U is like the next week or something.

48:59.885 --> 49:01.486
[SPEAKER_17]: That movie was like, okay.

49:01.526 --> 49:02.987
[SPEAKER_15]: That movie had funny parts though.

49:03.047 --> 49:06.049
[SPEAKER_17]: That movie was like, okay, maybe, and then 3 was like, no.

49:06.129 --> 49:07.270
[SPEAKER_15]: And it had David Warner in it.

49:08.191 --> 49:09.111
[SPEAKER_23]: Street Fighter came out in 94.

49:09.151 --> 49:09.111
94?

49:09.191 --> 49:09.432
[SPEAKER_23]: Yes.

49:10.132 --> 49:12.654
[SPEAKER_23]: The year I graduated.

49:12.674 --> 49:15.236
[SPEAKER_18]: I would have been a sophomore in high school.

49:15.896 --> 49:16.897
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, we both would have.

49:17.037 --> 49:19.639
[SPEAKER_18]: I dragged my dad to see that even though I was a sophomore in high school.

49:19.659 --> 49:20.200
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess so.

49:21.060 --> 49:21.340
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

49:21.461 --> 49:23.342
[SPEAKER_23]: I let him get my license until junior.

49:24.164 --> 49:27.887
[SPEAKER_15]: I was, yeah, well, I remember still being in high school when I saw it, so.

49:28.728 --> 49:29.709
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I graduated that year.

49:30.429 --> 49:30.769
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow.

49:31.950 --> 49:32.831
[SPEAKER_18]: God, I feel old.

49:32.911 --> 49:33.171
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

49:34.613 --> 49:36.534
[SPEAKER_14]: You were a sophomore and I graduated that year.

49:36.754 --> 49:37.535
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I know.

49:37.635 --> 49:37.875
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

49:38.516 --> 49:39.036
[SPEAKER_23]: You feel old?

49:39.657 --> 49:40.498
[SPEAKER_18]: That's true, I am younger.

49:40.558 --> 49:41.638
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, so shut up.

49:43.320 --> 49:43.540
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

49:44.761 --> 49:45.702
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go to a break, shall we?

49:46.442 --> 49:46.583
[SPEAKER_15]: No.

49:46.603 --> 49:47.543
[SPEAKER_18]: I think we need to do a break.

49:47.563 --> 49:48.184
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I don't think so.

49:48.344 --> 49:49.445
[SPEAKER_15]: Sorry, Rob, no break for you.

49:50.248 --> 49:50.848
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, break time.

49:50.868 --> 50:03.434
[SPEAKER_18]: When we come back from this break, we're going to be talking about 2DX Tent Style, the consumer version that's going to be coming out soon, because we actually have been sent some MP3s from our buddy Siggy, who calls in on the Skype line quite a bit.

50:04.195 --> 50:10.138
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to call us back on Skype when we come back from the next break and talk about these brand new Tent Style consumer tracks.

50:10.458 --> 50:12.159
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be pretty sweet, so stay tuned for that.

50:12.539 --> 50:16.941
[SPEAKER_18]: In the meantime, we're going to go to break, and I thought in this break we could do some music from Guitadora V.

50:17.711 --> 50:24.817
[SPEAKER_18]: because, as you might have heard at Tokyo Game Show this week, Guitar Freaks V and Drumania V coming out for the PlayStation 2.

50:25.477 --> 50:28.400
[SPEAKER_14]: So, finally... More stuff to import!

50:28.420 --> 50:29.821
[SPEAKER_17]: Did you hear about the other thing about it?

50:29.841 --> 50:34.965
[SPEAKER_18]: The arcade-style controller, the ASC, is also going to be released for Guitar Freaks.

50:35.310 --> 50:36.310
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I have to tell Dan about that.

50:36.330 --> 50:37.171
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know about Drum Mania.

50:37.291 --> 50:38.011
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll buy those.

50:38.211 --> 50:39.132
[SPEAKER_17]: I'll buy those guitars.

50:39.152 --> 50:40.832
[SPEAKER_18]: But they're doing an ASC for Guitar Freak.

50:40.873 --> 50:43.634
[SPEAKER_15]: If they did a Drum Mania one, you know I'd freaking have that.

50:43.674 --> 50:46.795
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't even know how the hell they would do an arcade-style version of that.

50:47.395 --> 50:47.936
[SPEAKER_18]: Easy enough.

50:48.056 --> 51:01.962
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be sweet either way, and I'm just excited because I'm hoping that they can bring back now, they can make these games, because assumably they'll do one for V2 down the line if this one's successful, and they can add so many old songs in it.

51:02.342 --> 51:02.702
[SPEAKER_17]: I hope.

51:02.782 --> 51:03.623
[SPEAKER_17]: I really hope they do it.

51:03.643 --> 51:05.984
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, you know, they are talking about doing this for the U.S.

51:06.024 --> 51:06.284
[SPEAKER_18]: too.

51:06.885 --> 51:07.225
[SPEAKER_17]: Really?

51:07.845 --> 51:08.226
[SPEAKER_17]: We'll see.

51:09.046 --> 51:09.386
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

51:10.367 --> 51:12.088
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that'll be the big secret at next year's E3.

51:12.128 --> 51:12.448
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

51:12.568 --> 51:12.868
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

51:13.749 --> 51:14.089
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

51:14.910 --> 51:16.851
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll start off with some B4U next.

51:17.571 --> 51:18.932
[SPEAKER_18]: B4U next is going to kick it off.

51:19.072 --> 51:21.293
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're also going to have a band called Pooh in this break.

51:22.214 --> 51:25.336
[SPEAKER_18]: All from Aguitadora V. We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

51:35.191 --> 51:35.972
Thanks for watching!

51:56.104 --> 51:57.184
Thank you for watching.

51:57.244 --> 51:57.864
See you next time.

52:25.069 --> 52:26.330
Thank you for watching!

52:47.654 --> 52:48.855
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

53:10.014 --> 53:11.036
Thank you for watching!

53:55.518 --> 54:05.381
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be back and turn my mouth with a big smile Please don't be shy to me It's killing me, so let me be X-mas from now without the king of X-mas from now

54:26.608 --> 54:29.969
I'm the best friend of the best friends

55:10.153 --> 55:26.585
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh We found a place to be So far from this fallen sea But you found a valid way To shadow up my face

55:33.530 --> 55:42.316
[SPEAKER_09]: Your kisses turned from hot to cold and I felt like a sentry phone Cheap and nasty with dirty men Looking for love that they never will get

55:44.953 --> 55:56.937
I'm feeling about you, feeling low I'm growing too high, I'm on the road There's no way, there's no way If you wanna lie to me again The reason why your face is on the air Just go there, and stay there Oh, oh, oh

56:11.719 --> 56:13.421
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

57:03.789 --> 57:05.570
Thank you for watching.

57:27.600 --> 57:33.885
[SPEAKER_08]: Hibiki Aema Mujou Sorega Kanjouron no S.O.S.

57:34.365 --> 57:49.236
[SPEAKER_08]: Sonzai Kaito Saki Nobashi Itsumari Souda yo Tsuzuku Aimai Let's Go Kanjouron On Oni Shite Tsunagu Kanshouzai Mousou Kizuka Let's Go Katsou Genjitsu no Katsou Genjitsu no

57:57.962 --> 57:58.983
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you for watching!

58:27.738 --> 58:37.566
[SPEAKER_10]: From the Step Squad to Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

58:37.606 --> 58:37.846
[SPEAKER_04]: Holler!

58:37.866 --> 58:38.607
[SPEAKER_04]: P-T-P-O P-T-P-O

58:51.257 --> 58:51.657
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's segment

59:19.375 --> 59:21.016
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Sakura's Yo Mama Joke of the Week

59:50.748 --> 59:51.268
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right.

59:51.588 --> 59:52.668
[SPEAKER_18]: This is going to be... Huh?

59:52.908 --> 59:54.068
[SPEAKER_09]: The music's messed up.

59:55.229 --> 01:00:05.191
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a leftover from Vanilla Sky, so... Now that that show's not on anymore, we have this here, so... Anyway, so this segment is very simple because Yo Mama jokes are still funny.

01:00:05.911 --> 01:00:08.931
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura will be reading a Yo Mama joke every week.

01:00:09.451 --> 01:00:13.212
[SPEAKER_18]: So, DarkSakura, what is tonight's Yo Mama joke of the week?

01:00:13.952 --> 01:00:15.193
[SPEAKER_13]: Are you sure you can handle it?

01:00:16.533 --> 01:00:17.033
[SPEAKER_18]: I think so.

01:00:18.314 --> 01:00:21.136
[SPEAKER_13]: Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.

01:00:23.938 --> 01:00:25.720
[SPEAKER_17]: Great, that's great.

01:00:26.200 --> 01:00:27.000
[SPEAKER_13]: That was so funny.

01:00:27.161 --> 01:00:29.262
[SPEAKER_17]: Yo mama's so nasty she brings crabs to the beach.

01:00:29.402 --> 01:00:30.583
[SPEAKER_17]: What's that sound I hear?

01:00:30.983 --> 01:00:33.265
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh yes, it's jumping the shark.

01:00:35.767 --> 01:00:36.567
[SPEAKER_15]: I got another one.

01:00:38.049 --> 01:00:38.969
[SPEAKER_18]: No, no, save it for next week.

01:00:39.189 --> 01:00:39.910
[SPEAKER_18]: You only get one joke a week.

01:00:39.950 --> 01:00:41.011
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of yo mama jokes.

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:41.491
[SPEAKER_18]: I know you do.

01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:43.032
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:00:48.166 --> 01:01:00.437
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, see, some of the old school Orange Lounge Radio listeners actually remember that being the exact same theme music we used to use on Vanilla Sky for the world's worst forward, where I would read a forwarded joke over email.

01:01:00.577 --> 01:01:02.439
[SPEAKER_18]: Things that actually get sent to me at work...

01:01:03.234 --> 01:01:10.439
[SPEAKER_18]: But the funny, the ironic thing is, I mean, we haven't been doing Vanilla Sky lately on the network just because of personal conflicts with scheduling.

01:01:10.979 --> 01:01:13.380
[SPEAKER_18]: And I don't get forwarded emails at work anymore.

01:01:13.861 --> 01:01:17.063
[SPEAKER_18]: Like they crack down on it or something, so I really don't get them anymore.

01:01:17.143 --> 01:01:18.604
[SPEAKER_18]: So I wouldn't have any jokes to read anyway.

01:01:18.864 --> 01:01:20.645
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm glad we could recycle the theme music.

01:01:20.945 --> 01:01:27.309
[SPEAKER_15]: So listeners, if you have a really awesome Yo Mama joke, send them to jamie at orangezonesradio.com.

01:01:28.154 --> 01:01:36.040
[SPEAKER_15]: and while I'm sifting through emails from teachers and the podcast emails and everything else.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:36.980
[SPEAKER_18]: She'll have some Yo Mama jokes.

01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:38.981
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll have some Yo Mama jokes too to read at work.

01:01:39.021 --> 01:01:39.602
[SPEAKER_18]: And you know what?

01:01:39.642 --> 01:01:42.304
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe once a month we could mix it up a little bit and do Yo Daddy.

01:01:43.665 --> 01:01:44.145
[SPEAKER_18]: Do Yo Daddy.

01:01:44.165 --> 01:01:45.486
[SPEAKER_15]: We're an equal opportunity show.

01:01:45.506 --> 01:01:47.687
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we're equal opportunity offenders so we could do Yo Daddy.

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:49.608
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:01:52.010 --> 01:01:53.451
[SPEAKER_18]: Now we got the whole chat room started.

01:01:53.731 --> 01:01:56.213
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be one of those jokes where all night long they can't stop...

01:01:57.538 --> 01:02:03.663
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

01:02:23.382 --> 01:02:23.702
[SPEAKER_18]: Huh?

01:02:24.203 --> 01:02:24.583
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think?

01:02:24.603 --> 01:02:25.364
[SPEAKER_18]: The nunchucks?

01:02:25.424 --> 01:02:26.465
[SPEAKER_18]: The Nintendo nunchucks?

01:02:26.505 --> 01:02:27.065
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think?

01:02:27.586 --> 01:02:28.927
[SPEAKER_15]: The butt controller?

01:02:29.047 --> 01:02:29.568
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

01:02:30.929 --> 01:02:36.194
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of one of those things where I can't knock it until I've tried it.

01:02:36.394 --> 01:02:38.496
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, bless Nintendo for doing something new.

01:02:39.356 --> 01:02:43.100
[SPEAKER_18]: Certainly, they're trying something new with this, but I don't know.

01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:47.784
[SPEAKER_18]: It's going to be kind of weird at first, but then again, if you think about it, you know, a lot of the...

01:02:48.531 --> 01:02:54.113
[SPEAKER_18]: The iToy was weird at first too, but of course the iToy is not that great a peripheral now, just because they don't have good games to support it.

01:02:56.393 --> 01:03:00.714
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I guess maybe DDR, but even then, hands and feet modes kind of knocked on.

01:03:01.255 --> 01:03:04.035
[SPEAKER_17]: They have some other games that feature the iToy.

01:03:04.075 --> 01:03:05.076
[SPEAKER_17]: What, Antigrav?

01:03:05.336 --> 01:03:12.097
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they have this game DT Racer, which was a really crappy racing game that used the iToy for some reason to steer.

01:03:12.678 --> 01:03:17.579
[SPEAKER_17]: And they have another game, Virtua Tennis, that you can use that to play tennis as well.

01:03:19.005 --> 01:03:24.194
[SPEAKER_17]: All the games that feature the eye toy, though, other than DDR and stuff, they kind of suck.

01:03:25.596 --> 01:03:28.420
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, even those eye toy modes suck.

01:03:28.901 --> 01:03:29.322
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I know.

01:03:30.784 --> 01:03:32.807
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, the thing, though, about the Nintendo Revolution...

01:03:33.786 --> 01:03:35.347
[SPEAKER_18]: The controller is not my issue.

01:03:35.587 --> 01:03:37.028
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm willing to try this new controller.

01:03:37.068 --> 01:03:37.989
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it'll be interesting.

01:03:38.049 --> 01:03:44.092
[SPEAKER_18]: It's different, so it gives the Nintendo something to really separate itself from Sony and Microsoft, which is kind of what it needs right now.

01:03:44.112 --> 01:03:45.673
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what my first complaint about it is?

01:03:45.733 --> 01:03:46.053
[SPEAKER_18]: What's that?

01:03:46.634 --> 01:03:47.214
[SPEAKER_15]: Ergonomics.

01:03:48.235 --> 01:03:48.655
[SPEAKER_18]: You think?

01:03:48.855 --> 01:03:51.537
[SPEAKER_15]: That controller is not ergonomically sound.

01:03:53.358 --> 01:04:00.902
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, hold out your hand for a moment and think about how it's going to be working a remote control for hours of gameplay.

01:04:02.443 --> 01:04:03.224
[SPEAKER_15]: That's why...

01:04:04.649 --> 01:04:12.233
[SPEAKER_15]: For example, I always bring this up as an example of the best controller ever designed, and that would be the Saturn Dual Analog Controller.

01:04:13.894 --> 01:04:15.654
[SPEAKER_15]: It fits naturally to your hand.

01:04:16.215 --> 01:04:19.216
[SPEAKER_15]: Even the PlayStation controller, it's meant to fit to your hand.

01:04:20.056 --> 01:04:24.819
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, why is it that Nintendo has always had these bizarre-ass controllers that hurt to play?

01:04:26.019 --> 01:04:29.441
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I think the Super Nintendo had an intelligent controller.

01:04:29.461 --> 01:04:29.621
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

01:04:30.089 --> 01:04:35.914
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you'll notice, they re-released that style controller for the NES when they brought out the top loader.

01:04:37.055 --> 01:04:40.918
[SPEAKER_15]: They did one... Naki did one for the GameCube.

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:42.119
[SPEAKER_15]: I have, like, two of them.

01:04:45.422 --> 01:04:54.730
[SPEAKER_15]: I think that a lot of the complaint they're going to get with this controller, apart from it just being a really bad idea in general, is a case of ergonomics.

01:04:54.830 --> 01:04:58.533
[SPEAKER_15]: That controller is not going to be a comfortable thing to play for a long time.

01:04:59.383 --> 01:05:00.964
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see, we'll see.

01:05:01.144 --> 01:05:05.446
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you see the mock-up that Loki posted on our website earlier, just a couple days ago?

01:05:05.466 --> 01:05:07.167
[SPEAKER_15]: I saw what was on Nintendo's website.

01:05:07.747 --> 01:05:14.251
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you see the WaveBird thing, where you can plug that little remote into a WaveBird-style controller, and you can play...

01:05:15.214 --> 01:05:18.435
[SPEAKER_18]: Your Revolution Games, like with a GameCube-style controller, basically.

01:05:18.455 --> 01:05:26.759
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, see, my other thought was that, you know, a month later, they were going to bring out some overpriced controller that's all ergonomically sound that they're going to charge a bajillion for, because it's Nintendo!

01:05:27.259 --> 01:05:28.239
[SPEAKER_15]: They do shit like this.

01:05:28.479 --> 01:05:29.440
[SPEAKER_18]: Are your arms hurting?

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:34.522
[SPEAKER_18]: Get the new Nintendo Arm Herd Eliminator, or whatever they call it.

01:05:34.562 --> 01:05:42.225
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, seriously, I knew right now, I'm not going to be able to play that machine, given the wrist problems I have at work.

01:05:43.065 --> 01:05:44.146
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to use a trackball mouse.

01:05:45.754 --> 01:05:53.500
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't hold two separate things like that and hold my hand in that position without having quite a bit of pain.

01:05:54.521 --> 01:05:56.183
[SPEAKER_18]: So are you going to give it a try?

01:05:56.203 --> 01:05:57.724
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course I'm going to try it.

01:05:57.744 --> 01:06:01.127
[SPEAKER_18]: See if maybe the feel of it is different than it looks at first?

01:06:01.347 --> 01:06:10.115
[SPEAKER_15]: Of course I'm going to try it, but in the end, looking at the design, having a very good sense of spatial awareness and knowing how my hands work...

01:06:10.854 --> 01:06:33.049
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and just with the bajillions of other people I work with, you know, good friends of mine at my job who all have carpal tunnel, various other ailments that come from doing a desk job, you know, even for people who just play on the internet a lot, you know, are developing the same wrist ailments because the average home is not set up to be ergonomically correct for your own desk.

01:06:33.329 --> 01:06:33.469
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.

01:06:34.036 --> 01:06:37.417
[SPEAKER_15]: Imagine having this in your hand for standard gameplay.

01:06:37.778 --> 01:06:40.859
[SPEAKER_15]: And a lot of gamers, when they get into their game, they'll ignore their own pain for the game.

01:06:41.099 --> 01:06:41.499
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry.

01:06:41.559 --> 01:06:42.079
[SPEAKER_15]: It happens.

01:06:42.359 --> 01:06:42.900
[SPEAKER_18]: I've done it.

01:06:42.920 --> 01:06:43.700
[SPEAKER_18]: Some people don't, yeah.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:51.603
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's going to cause... It's just going to open up a load of medical concerns.

01:06:52.103 --> 01:06:52.444
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:06:52.584 --> 01:06:54.244
[SPEAKER_15]: I really do think it's going to be a question of ergonomics.

01:06:54.364 --> 01:06:57.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, let's not forget, though, that things could change.

01:06:58.006 --> 01:06:59.486
[SPEAKER_18]: This is still very, very early on.

01:06:59.527 --> 01:07:02.408
[SPEAKER_18]: And I seem to recall that when we saw the Nintendo DS at E3...

01:07:03.468 --> 01:07:07.952
[SPEAKER_18]: Only a few months before its release, the DS kind of changed.

01:07:08.272 --> 01:07:11.334
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember the one at E3 was more rounded on the size.

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:19.680
[SPEAKER_18]: It kind of changed the way the DS is shaped, and so they changed kind of the way the controller and buttons were, so things could change with this before it's actually released.

01:07:19.820 --> 01:07:25.524
[SPEAKER_15]: I did notice a different setting of the buttons, and this is actually a little bit more comfortable to play than the lockup they had at E3.

01:07:26.465 --> 01:07:27.146
[SPEAKER_18]: So, yeah.

01:07:27.486 --> 01:07:27.966
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

01:07:28.026 --> 01:07:34.370
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe when they do some of the extensive testing, some of your concerns are going to come out and they'll kind of rethink some things.

01:07:34.690 --> 01:07:34.890
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

01:07:35.270 --> 01:07:36.271
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what happens.

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:37.072
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see what happens.

01:07:37.512 --> 01:07:37.872
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:07:38.632 --> 01:07:41.974
[SPEAKER_15]: And by the way, according to Firebomb, Loki, you're the reason babies cry at night.

01:07:44.156 --> 01:07:46.137
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, they don't stop bitching.

01:07:46.297 --> 01:07:47.178
[SPEAKER_17]: I just ignore it.

01:07:47.218 --> 01:07:47.538
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

01:07:48.358 --> 01:07:50.700
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I got over it like years ago.

01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:51.280
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:07:51.480 --> 01:07:51.880
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

01:07:52.321 --> 01:07:52.601
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:07:54.122 --> 01:07:54.382
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:07:54.773 --> 01:07:57.113
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to get into... Hi, how are you?

01:07:57.774 --> 01:07:58.514
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, hi, guys.

01:08:01.554 --> 01:08:04.195
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, let's... How long have you guys been knocking on the door?

01:08:04.235 --> 01:08:04.875
[SPEAKER_18]: We didn't even hear you.

01:08:06.075 --> 01:08:06.635
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, okay.

01:08:07.756 --> 01:08:08.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, sorry.

01:08:08.336 --> 01:08:08.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, hi.

01:08:08.896 --> 01:08:10.856
[SPEAKER_18]: We were just joined by Angel and Magus.

01:08:10.896 --> 01:08:14.677
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see if we can get them a microphone here real quick.

01:08:14.717 --> 01:08:16.577
[SPEAKER_18]: Real, real quick, because I've got to answer a call on Skype here.

01:08:17.738 --> 01:08:18.218
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, guys.

01:08:18.558 --> 01:08:19.138
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, how you doing?

01:08:19.178 --> 01:08:19.818
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound sick.

01:08:20.258 --> 01:08:21.799
[SPEAKER_11]: No, I'm just really, really tired.

01:08:21.879 --> 01:08:23.519
[SPEAKER_11]: We've had a long weekend at the...

01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:26.221
[SPEAKER_11]: They're real life gathering.

01:08:26.241 --> 01:08:29.624
[SPEAKER_11]: I know most of you hear me talk about that quite a bit, but yeah.

01:08:30.564 --> 01:08:33.226
[SPEAKER_11]: So, it's just meeting real people behind their cars.

01:08:33.267 --> 01:08:35.008
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, welcome back to the show, Angel.

01:08:35.028 --> 01:08:36.129
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's been a while since you've been here.

01:08:36.149 --> 01:08:36.569
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I know.

01:08:36.789 --> 01:08:40.252
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, and the 23rd Magus, you haven't been here in a long-ass time.

01:08:40.452 --> 01:08:40.953
[SPEAKER_20]: I know.

01:08:41.093 --> 01:08:42.794
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been painful.

01:08:43.134 --> 01:08:44.295
[SPEAKER_20]: I swear, it's been painful.

01:08:44.796 --> 01:08:45.876
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, you're here.

01:08:45.976 --> 01:08:49.459
[SPEAKER_18]: I just want to slap your shirt, because it's a giant power button.

01:08:51.040 --> 01:08:52.081
[SPEAKER_18]: Not that I want to turn you on, but anyway.

01:08:54.856 --> 01:08:55.837
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on.

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:57.338
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's move on.

01:08:57.398 --> 01:08:58.659
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks for the pleasant surprise, you guys.

01:08:59.579 --> 01:09:00.940
[SPEAKER_15]: For the record, you're looking older.

01:09:03.022 --> 01:09:05.563
[SPEAKER_18]: Aw, our Andrew's getting so big.

01:09:07.104 --> 01:09:07.344
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

01:09:07.865 --> 01:09:08.585
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm just kidding.

01:09:08.886 --> 01:09:12.488
[SPEAKER_18]: I've got somebody on Skype that's waiting for us to cut the bullshit and get to his call.

01:09:12.548 --> 01:09:13.889
[SPEAKER_18]: So, hello, Siggy.

01:09:13.949 --> 01:09:14.509
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you doing?

01:09:15.150 --> 01:09:15.770
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, Scott.

01:09:15.790 --> 01:09:16.491
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm doing fine.

01:09:16.711 --> 01:09:17.031
[SPEAKER_18]: Good.

01:09:17.071 --> 01:09:17.491
[SPEAKER_18]: Good to hear.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.513
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what's this?

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:24.456
[SPEAKER_18]: You found some new stuff in regards to 2DX 10th style, the consumer version?

01:09:25.191 --> 01:09:25.451
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep.

01:09:25.872 --> 01:09:26.853
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you got for us tonight?

01:09:27.534 --> 01:09:33.241
[SPEAKER_22]: There are two 2DX10 style CS exclusives, but they are long versions.

01:09:33.441 --> 01:09:34.062
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, very cool.

01:09:34.082 --> 01:09:35.264
[SPEAKER_18]: So we have some long versions.

01:09:35.324 --> 01:09:37.086
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, how did you come across these MP3s?

01:09:38.508 --> 01:09:42.413
[SPEAKER_22]: Panda of LOTB from Bimani Style of Forms has posted it.

01:09:43.567 --> 01:09:44.667
[SPEAKER_22]: on the temporary forums.

01:09:44.767 --> 01:09:45.148
[SPEAKER_18]: Very cool.

01:09:45.168 --> 01:09:45.628
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, that's right.

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:53.090
[SPEAKER_18]: Bamani Style right now is running on some temporary forums, and I thought it was kind of interesting because isn't, like, some gaming company hosting their sites, like PlayAsia or something?

01:09:53.290 --> 01:09:56.111
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it was PlayAsia was hosting the temporary forums.

01:09:56.191 --> 01:09:56.471
[SPEAKER_18]: Interesting.

01:09:56.931 --> 01:10:00.312
[SPEAKER_18]: Are they still running on a temporary basis, or did they get back up, or what?

01:10:00.572 --> 01:10:02.033
[SPEAKER_18]: I haven't visited them in a while.

01:10:02.153 --> 01:10:03.373
[SPEAKER_22]: They're still running right now.

01:10:03.493 --> 01:10:03.773
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, cool.

01:10:03.813 --> 01:10:04.054
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

01:10:05.034 --> 01:10:05.434
[SPEAKER_22]: Very cool.

01:10:05.874 --> 01:10:06.154
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:10:07.155 --> 01:10:08.455
[SPEAKER_18]: So anyway, about these songs...

01:10:09.688 --> 01:10:15.570
[SPEAKER_22]: Before I introduce the songs, I want to post this website on the chatroom right now.

01:10:15.750 --> 01:10:16.270
[SPEAKER_18]: Go for it.

01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:18.871
[SPEAKER_18]: And that chatroom, once again, orangeloungeradio.com.

01:10:18.931 --> 01:10:24.152
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on chat if you want to join in the chatroom and get these little links as people post them, as Siggy's doing right now.

01:10:24.792 --> 01:10:25.233
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

01:10:25.553 --> 01:10:27.253
[SPEAKER_22]: It's on the Xenon website.

01:10:28.574 --> 01:10:37.016
[SPEAKER_22]: And what this site has is pictures of 2GX 10th Style CS shot from a Tokyo game show.

01:10:37.472 --> 01:10:39.273
[SPEAKER_22]: Traces, Quasar, LoveShine, and the also-loving V

01:11:03.223 --> 01:11:16.550
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, somebody mentioned the V thing in the chatroom before the show started, and I was just like, oh my gosh, okay, if V is returning in 10th style, that means it was in 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th, and now 10th.

01:11:17.511 --> 01:11:18.512
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we say overkill?

01:11:19.632 --> 01:11:21.053
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, it's really the longest one.

01:11:21.113 --> 01:11:21.813
[SPEAKER_22]: Wow, okay.

01:11:23.034 --> 01:11:24.755
[SPEAKER_22]: And now I'm gonna introduce the, uh...

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:31.913
[SPEAKER_22]: CS exclusives that have been confirmed so far, there are four of them, and two of them are going to be on the minute-long clip.

01:11:32.393 --> 01:11:33.533
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm going to introduce the first one.

01:11:33.633 --> 01:11:38.035
[SPEAKER_22]: The genre is GABA, and the song is Hype the Core by DJ Chucky.

01:11:39.516 --> 01:11:40.896
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, okay.

01:11:41.797 --> 01:11:46.699
[SPEAKER_22]: And then the second genre is Psychedelic Trance, and it's by LED.

01:11:46.779 --> 01:11:48.099
[SPEAKER_22]: It's Ixian.

01:11:48.800 --> 01:11:49.040
[SPEAKER_22]: Mm-hmm.

01:11:49.858 --> 01:11:59.848
[SPEAKER_22]: and now for the songs that has to clip a minute long and the genre is R&B and here's Asami with Strong Woman featuring Dabo alright, here it is

01:12:26.393 --> 01:12:27.263
Yeah, he's coming.

01:12:50.069 --> 01:12:52.951
[SPEAKER_10]: Akira Yamaoka's album got pushed back to January, is that true?

01:13:17.524 --> 01:13:19.806
[SPEAKER_18]: I didn't get any details for that.

01:13:19.926 --> 01:13:20.926
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard something about it.

01:13:21.006 --> 01:13:25.930
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if this is true or not, but I heard that Akira Yamaoka's album is getting pushed back from October to January, which is kind of a bummer.

01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:28.372
[SPEAKER_18]: Because it was supposed to come out Halloween week, which is so appropriate.

01:13:28.412 --> 01:13:28.812
[SPEAKER_18]: But we'll see.

01:13:28.972 --> 01:13:29.252
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:13:29.593 --> 01:13:29.793
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

01:13:30.698 --> 01:13:35.021
[SPEAKER_22]: And here's the last song, you know, one of the CS exclusives.

01:13:35.441 --> 01:13:37.482
[SPEAKER_22]: And this one's a very deep Japanese meaning.

01:13:37.542 --> 01:13:39.883
[SPEAKER_22]: I still can't figure out what it means.

01:13:40.804 --> 01:13:44.606
[SPEAKER_22]: So here's the genre is Japanese Pops.

01:13:44.866 --> 01:13:49.108
[SPEAKER_22]: Here's Burme Inazawa featuring Shimotsuki Haruka with Taito no Suika.

01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:49.869
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, here it is.

01:14:08.322 --> 01:14:08.985
Thanks for watching!

01:14:47.503 --> 01:14:49.284
[SPEAKER_18]: It's kind of a different one.

01:14:49.344 --> 01:14:50.544
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know if I could see that in 2DX.

01:14:50.564 --> 01:14:52.845
[SPEAKER_18]: It reminds me of the soundtrack that goes in the shell.

01:14:53.865 --> 01:14:56.666
[SPEAKER_15]: It reminds me too much of Yoko Kanno.

01:14:58.367 --> 01:14:59.367
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a good song.

01:14:59.407 --> 01:15:00.507
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that song.

01:15:00.748 --> 01:15:02.448
[SPEAKER_18]: That's going to be an interesting one for 2DX.

01:15:02.508 --> 01:15:03.969
[SPEAKER_18]: Maybe that's going to be an easy difficulty.

01:15:04.009 --> 01:15:04.289
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

01:15:04.329 --> 01:15:04.629
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:15:06.129 --> 01:15:06.890
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, hopefully.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.050
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be difficult on another.

01:15:09.471 --> 01:15:11.371
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I could see that, maybe.

01:15:11.891 --> 01:15:13.552
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, what's your personal opinion on those two songs?

01:15:14.395 --> 01:15:19.056
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I kind of like Strong Woman featuring Dabo better than Taito no Suika.

01:15:43.055 --> 01:15:55.663
[SPEAKER_22]: On the Zenon website, there are links that have the video files that contain videos from Chen Style CS that has been recorded, like Ixion and Hype the Core, and also Strong Woman.

01:15:55.964 --> 01:16:02.168
[SPEAKER_22]: However, when I watch these videos, you won't be able to hear the actual song.

01:16:02.848 --> 01:16:04.149
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, you can just see the video.

01:16:04.689 --> 01:16:10.654
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, you can only see the video, but you're only going to hear outside what's happening on TGS.

01:16:11.094 --> 01:16:11.274
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

01:16:12.413 --> 01:16:16.135
[SPEAKER_18]: Speaking of what's happening on TGS4, what else have you heard about what's going on at Tokyo Game Show?

01:16:17.096 --> 01:16:18.857
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else that's exciting to you?

01:16:19.257 --> 01:16:20.118
[SPEAKER_22]: Nothing much else.

01:16:20.418 --> 01:16:27.102
[SPEAKER_22]: I only checked out Poppin' Music and Guitadora V. I was surprised that they're going to have Guitadora V for the PS2.

01:16:27.162 --> 01:16:30.604
[SPEAKER_18]: That was kind of a real surprise announcement, I think, to a lot of us.

01:16:30.664 --> 01:16:35.227
[SPEAKER_18]: We kind of all assumed that Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania on PS2 was dead and gone.

01:16:35.768 --> 01:16:42.195
[SPEAKER_18]: But it always was kind of interesting that they kept it going in the arcades and yet no love for it on the console.

01:16:42.215 --> 01:16:46.499
[SPEAKER_18]: So it was just kind of like, maybe it was something that we always kind of wished would happen in the back of our minds.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:48.261
[SPEAKER_18]: It was just kind of sudden, like, oh my gosh.

01:16:48.421 --> 01:16:58.492
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, we were expecting, you know, obviously we were expecting 2DX10th, we were expecting Strike, we were expecting Iroha, but to see Guitar Freaks as well is pretty cool, so...

01:16:59.269 --> 01:17:09.873
[SPEAKER_18]: I think the only thing that could top that in the surprise category is, like Loki said, they end up bringing that to America, which would be very interesting when you consider the Guitar Heroes on its way as well.

01:17:09.893 --> 01:17:10.974
[SPEAKER_18]: It could be very interesting.

01:17:11.854 --> 01:17:14.315
[SPEAKER_18]: So we'll see.

01:17:15.176 --> 01:17:18.717
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, Siggy, thank you very much for calling in and sharing those songs with us.

01:17:18.757 --> 01:17:22.819
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate it, helping us stay in the know on what's going on in the Bomani world.

01:17:22.919 --> 01:17:24.359
[SPEAKER_18]: No problem.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:25.460
[SPEAKER_18]: Any other final thoughts for us?

01:17:26.261 --> 01:17:36.509
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, not at the moment, I just can't think of any, but, uh, you know, everybody's been, uh, on the, uh, Bermanis South Formas have been complaining about V. Being back in the game again.

01:17:36.789 --> 01:17:37.069
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:17:37.089 --> 01:17:37.770
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:49.979
[SPEAKER_18]: It, uh, you know, it's one of those things now where they must just be doing it out of tradition or something, I don't know, because the song's so horrid, I don't know if it's some type of nod to the fans or something, but...

01:17:50.672 --> 01:17:52.055
[SPEAKER_18]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:18:01.323 --> 01:18:02.243
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, one more thing.

01:18:02.864 --> 01:18:06.145
[SPEAKER_18]: On the 10th style result screens, they're going to feature more Goliaths.

01:18:06.225 --> 01:18:10.267
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard about that, because in the arcades, they didn't have anything unless you AAA'd a song.

01:18:10.287 --> 01:18:11.467
[SPEAKER_22]: They lacked a Goliath.

01:18:11.687 --> 01:18:11.927
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:18:11.947 --> 01:18:12.968
[SPEAKER_22]: They lacked the Goliaths.

01:18:14.388 --> 01:18:16.269
[SPEAKER_22]: It's already featured on the Xenon website right now.

01:18:16.329 --> 01:18:24.313
[SPEAKER_22]: It's featured Nix and the... Use for the single A and then Nix for the double A. Very cool, very cool.

01:18:24.613 --> 01:18:27.374
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, you're talking about the repetition of V, right?

01:18:27.394 --> 01:18:27.534
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

01:18:28.055 --> 01:18:29.375
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, look at DDR.

01:18:29.695 --> 01:18:31.096
[SPEAKER_20]: For example, say, B4U.

01:18:31.156 --> 01:18:35.796
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, actually 6 mixes if you count 4th Plus.

01:18:36.516 --> 01:18:39.737
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, okay, maybe, but not 6 back-to-back mixes.

01:18:40.837 --> 01:18:41.897
[SPEAKER_18]: But I get what you're saying.

01:18:41.937 --> 01:18:43.698
[SPEAKER_18]: B4U is kind of a DDR anthem.

01:18:43.878 --> 01:18:44.498
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a staple.

01:18:44.518 --> 01:18:47.438
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, hell, they named a band after it, so, you know, okay, I get it.

01:18:47.458 --> 01:18:47.978
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess it kind of fits.

01:18:47.998 --> 01:18:48.659
[SPEAKER_18]: I get it, maybe.

01:18:48.979 --> 01:18:52.279
[SPEAKER_18]: But B4U is also a 2DX song, so why not repeat that over and over again?

01:18:52.519 --> 01:18:54.620
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's a staple of DDR, not 2DX.

01:18:55.540 --> 01:18:56.500
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, all right.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.320
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a cameo.

01:18:58.584 --> 01:18:58.924
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:18:59.364 --> 01:18:59.965
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Siggy.

01:19:00.005 --> 01:19:02.365
[SPEAKER_18]: Thanks so much for your call and calling us tonight.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:02.645
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:19:02.685 --> 01:19:03.126
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one.

01:19:03.166 --> 01:19:03.366
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:03.826
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:19:03.846 --> 01:19:04.086
[SPEAKER_18]: Bye.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:04.486
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:04.686
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

01:19:05.706 --> 01:19:05.986
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:19:06.006 --> 01:19:06.367
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the one.

01:19:06.387 --> 01:19:06.907
[SPEAKER_18]: Always, Siggy.

01:19:09.168 --> 01:19:11.968
[SPEAKER_18]: Sharing some 2DX MP3s with us.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:12.789
[SPEAKER_18]: We appreciate that.

01:19:14.258 --> 01:19:15.039
[SPEAKER_18]: Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune

01:19:36.041 --> 01:19:37.662
[SPEAKER_15]: That's actually the second game.

01:19:38.323 --> 01:19:38.583
[SPEAKER_18]: Tune 2.

01:19:38.623 --> 01:19:41.765
[SPEAKER_15]: The soundtrack is the first and second.

01:19:42.325 --> 01:19:43.827
[SPEAKER_15]: So each disc is each game.

01:19:44.127 --> 01:19:44.627
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, very cool.

01:19:44.807 --> 01:19:45.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Very cool.

01:19:46.368 --> 01:19:46.769
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:19:47.189 --> 01:19:48.450
[SPEAKER_15]: And it had Paul and Terry.

01:19:48.690 --> 01:19:49.090
[SPEAKER_18]: It did.

01:19:49.130 --> 01:19:51.172
[SPEAKER_18]: You allowed Paul and Terry to be played on the station.

01:19:51.212 --> 01:19:52.913
[SPEAKER_15]: Just because the whole soundtrack is fabulous.

01:19:52.993 --> 01:19:53.894
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, it's a good soundtrack.

01:19:53.914 --> 01:19:55.955
[SPEAKER_18]: And I actually like the Paul and Terry songs on there.

01:19:57.196 --> 01:19:59.618
[SPEAKER_18]: Also, before we go to break, I want to talk to Angel and Magus a little more.

01:19:59.638 --> 01:20:01.639
[SPEAKER_18]: So you guys went... Yeah, damn.

01:20:02.159 --> 01:20:03.460
[SPEAKER_18]: You come to the show and you have to talk.

01:20:03.540 --> 01:20:04.921
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, okay.

01:20:05.482 --> 01:20:05.602
[SPEAKER_18]: Um...

01:20:06.607 --> 01:20:07.007
[SPEAKER_18]: MMO without an RPG

01:20:32.031 --> 01:20:34.733
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds like a graphical chat, or is there a game to it?

01:20:34.853 --> 01:20:50.325
[SPEAKER_20]: Basically, it's like that, but you have, it's just based around a series of islands and such, and you have like buggies and hoverboards and hoverboats, and you can own property and play several mini-games in there.

01:20:50.445 --> 01:20:51.606
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not The Sims.

01:20:51.926 --> 01:20:54.708
[SPEAKER_20]: It's a social MMO, is basically what it is.

01:20:55.009 --> 01:20:55.389
[SPEAKER_11]: Pretty much.

01:20:57.739 --> 01:20:58.439
[SPEAKER_18]: That's interesting.

01:20:58.539 --> 01:20:59.880
[SPEAKER_18]: I wonder why I don't hear more about it.

01:20:59.940 --> 01:21:01.120
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, how many people were at this convention?

01:21:02.240 --> 01:21:03.301
[SPEAKER_11]: About 55 or so.

01:21:03.741 --> 01:21:04.221
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, cool.

01:21:04.401 --> 01:21:05.581
[SPEAKER_18]: And what kind of stuff did they do?

01:21:05.601 --> 01:21:25.187
[SPEAKER_11]: They had a lot of, kind of like meetings, but not, like, you know, each of the staff would give a presentation on certain things involving the community of the game, whether it be economics or community involvement or just,

01:21:25.923 --> 01:21:28.724
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just an open chat.

01:21:28.904 --> 01:21:34.405
[SPEAKER_11]: We would split up whoever wanted to go to whatever speech or whatever.

01:21:35.505 --> 01:21:37.046
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, it was just good.

01:21:37.566 --> 01:21:37.846
[SPEAKER_11]: Cool.

01:21:38.186 --> 01:21:48.229
[SPEAKER_11]: Plus you got to meet a lot of the people that you have interacted with in the game and gotten to be friends with.

01:21:48.429 --> 01:21:51.349
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just, I don't know, it's a very awesome experience.

01:21:52.290 --> 01:21:52.590
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:21:53.330 --> 01:21:53.950
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:56.061
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good, sounds good.

01:21:56.782 --> 01:21:57.642
[SPEAKER_11]: Very good times.

01:21:57.822 --> 01:21:58.883
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very tired, though.

01:21:59.844 --> 01:22:01.766
[SPEAKER_18]: You sound a little bit tired, but that's alright.

01:22:02.126 --> 01:22:03.448
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm usually tired after this convention.

01:22:03.548 --> 01:22:10.754
[SPEAKER_18]: Usually, when you hear the show on Orange Haunts Radio that's right after E3, we all sound like we want to die.

01:22:10.854 --> 01:22:11.575
[SPEAKER_11]: It was kind of funny.

01:22:11.835 --> 01:22:12.856
[SPEAKER_18]: We all sound like we want to die.

01:22:13.076 --> 01:22:14.257
[SPEAKER_18]: Life blows.

01:22:14.438 --> 01:22:14.698
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:22:14.718 --> 01:22:15.318
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:22:15.699 --> 01:22:16.880
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:22:17.060 --> 01:22:17.901
[SPEAKER_11]: Hotels.

01:22:19.022 --> 01:22:20.403
[SPEAKER_11]: It was a nice hotel, but it's like...

01:22:21.319 --> 01:22:22.160
[SPEAKER_11]: I want to go home now, bye.

01:22:38.570 --> 01:22:43.515
[SPEAKER_18]: Red has Scorpion Fire, so I'll bet money that V is not in Red consumer style.

01:22:43.915 --> 01:22:49.081
[SPEAKER_18]: So maybe that's one reason why V keeps repeating, because of the difficulty.

01:22:49.441 --> 01:22:50.622
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I can see that, maybe.

01:22:50.882 --> 01:22:51.323
[SPEAKER_18]: Safe bet.

01:22:51.563 --> 01:22:51.944
[SPEAKER_18]: Safe bet.

01:22:53.345 --> 01:22:59.331
[SPEAKER_18]: Although I would think most people that are going after the difficulty have, like, five different versions of 2DX, but, eh, that's just me.

01:23:00.267 --> 01:23:01.408
[SPEAKER_18]: Talk Like a Pirate Day Talk Like a Pirate Day

01:23:29.727 --> 01:23:31.328
[SPEAKER_18]: Very hushed Japanese, like in the movies.

01:23:32.069 --> 01:23:35.351
[SPEAKER_15]: No, this is where you walk around and everyone goes, Hi!

01:23:35.391 --> 01:23:36.432
[SPEAKER_16]: You go, Horosu.

01:23:40.875 --> 01:23:41.535
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, that was geeky.

01:23:41.755 --> 01:23:42.696
[SPEAKER_16]: Alright, we'll be back after this.

01:25:52.066 --> 01:25:54.190
Thank you for watching!

01:26:34.547 --> 01:26:35.655
Thank you for watching!

01:28:16.118 --> 01:28:17.060
Thanks for watching!

01:28:58.398 --> 01:28:59.405
Thanks for watching!

01:30:14.401 --> 01:30:14.963
Thank you for watching

01:30:57.802 --> 01:30:58.762
[SPEAKER_18]: Gaming Radio.

01:30:59.002 --> 01:31:06.265
[SPEAKER_16]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

01:31:06.445 --> 01:31:07.786
[SPEAKER_16]: Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:08.446 --> 01:31:15.028
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello everybody and welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio.

01:31:16.249 --> 01:31:17.969
[SPEAKER_18]: Hope you enjoyed some of the songs there in that break.

01:31:18.009 --> 01:31:20.370
[SPEAKER_18]: Nebula Grasper from the 2DX.

01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:22.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Ghosts from Ted DDR.

01:31:23.980 --> 01:31:29.001
[SPEAKER_18]: AA or Double Ace, however you choose to pronounce that one, from 2DXRed as well.

01:31:29.121 --> 01:31:29.881
[SPEAKER_18]: And then I Feel.

01:31:30.121 --> 01:31:32.762
[SPEAKER_18]: That was actually the DDR version, but of course I Feel was in both games.

01:31:33.022 --> 01:31:34.482
[SPEAKER_18]: So, anyway.

01:31:36.083 --> 01:31:38.303
[SPEAKER_17]: I feel better because I have vanilla milkshake.

01:31:39.203 --> 01:31:40.823
[SPEAKER_18]: Does your milkshake bring all the boys to the yard?

01:31:42.684 --> 01:31:45.124
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you for resurrecting that joke that died years ago.

01:31:46.105 --> 01:31:47.905
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, that was just last year, wasn't it?

01:31:47.925 --> 01:31:48.745
[SPEAKER_18]: That that song was big?

01:31:48.765 --> 01:31:50.325
[SPEAKER_18]: That was just last year.

01:31:50.886 --> 01:31:51.246
[SPEAKER_18]: Not bad.

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:52.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

01:31:54.629 --> 01:31:56.032
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, how are you doing over there?

01:31:56.673 --> 01:31:57.715
[SPEAKER_15]: About to blast somebody.

01:31:57.875 --> 01:31:58.677
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, what's going on?

01:31:59.306 --> 01:32:07.528
[SPEAKER_15]: Apparently somebody on dig.com said that our podcast sucks because for some reason they added a ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle.

01:32:07.928 --> 01:32:09.268
[SPEAKER_15]: What the fuck?

01:32:09.648 --> 01:32:11.469
[SPEAKER_17]: That ditzy girl they're referring to is actually Rob.

01:32:11.909 --> 01:32:14.410
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I'm the ditzy girl apparently.

01:32:15.290 --> 01:32:16.110
[SPEAKER_15]: No, no, no, no, no.

01:32:16.130 --> 01:32:16.930
[SPEAKER_15]: Will you put that in your reply?

01:32:17.770 --> 01:32:26.673
[SPEAKER_15]: First of all, first of all, I probably have more intelligence in my little toe than this person does if they clone them on repeat ad infinitum, okay?

01:32:27.813 --> 01:32:28.273
[SPEAKER_15]: Secondly...

01:32:31.002 --> 01:32:31.923
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a stupid message board.

01:32:32.644 --> 01:32:34.245
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you going to dignify it with a response?

01:32:35.225 --> 01:32:37.367
[SPEAKER_18]: Although you already did, but that's all right.

01:32:37.787 --> 01:32:39.228
[SPEAKER_15]: I haven't said anything yet.

01:32:39.548 --> 01:32:41.670
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, here's the thing, though.

01:32:41.710 --> 01:32:47.454
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody that's coming over from the podcast, because we had an increase of listeners to this live show because of our podcast, which is pretty cool.

01:32:47.714 --> 01:32:48.654
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just going to say this.

01:32:49.375 --> 01:32:53.698
[SPEAKER_15]: I repeated his comment to quote and say which one I'm referring to, and I'm just going to say this.

01:32:54.038 --> 01:32:56.480
[SPEAKER_15]: Next time, listen to the podcast all the way through.

01:32:57.600 --> 01:32:59.562
[SPEAKER_15]: Before deciding, I'm sorry, but you're a loser.

01:32:59.782 --> 01:33:04.567
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm not going to call him a loser because I know my netiquette, but I am going to say that you were the giggling girl.

01:33:08.567 --> 01:33:09.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's fine.

01:33:10.708 --> 01:33:11.088
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine.

01:33:13.630 --> 01:33:19.413
[SPEAKER_18]: If you know the history of Orange Launch Radio, this radio station actually started with DarkSakura and myself.

01:33:19.493 --> 01:33:25.957
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki actually was not a part of the original vision of the station because we didn't really know Loki when the show first started.

01:33:26.357 --> 01:33:30.279
[SPEAKER_18]: We met him, we knew who he was, he was this guy.

01:33:30.299 --> 01:33:30.960
[SPEAKER_18]: You knew me!

01:33:31.040 --> 01:33:33.401
[SPEAKER_18]: We knew you, but we didn't know that much about you.

01:33:33.581 --> 01:33:36.003
[SPEAKER_18]: You came to the Bomani parties and we knew that you'd

01:33:36.943 --> 01:33:37.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

01:34:07.578 --> 01:34:10.422
[SPEAKER_18]: If we want to find some giggling girls, maybe we can get some, but I don't know.

01:34:10.883 --> 01:34:12.004
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, here's my response.

01:34:12.144 --> 01:34:12.665
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, what?

01:34:12.765 --> 01:34:15.128
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to see what everyone thinks before I send it.

01:34:15.689 --> 01:34:19.634
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling... First, Monkey Butler, okay?

01:34:21.817 --> 01:34:25.722
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, I'm wondering where Monkey Butler gets off calling me a giggling ditzy girl.

01:34:26.368 --> 01:34:30.911
[SPEAKER_15]: He said this about my podcast, because we all did it.

01:34:31.031 --> 01:34:32.192
[SPEAKER_15]: Podcast Orange Lounge Radio.

01:34:32.572 --> 01:34:37.775
[SPEAKER_15]: Another gaming podcast that sucks because for some reason they added a ditzy girl to interrupt every sentence with a giggle or an attempted joke.

01:34:38.416 --> 01:34:40.457
[SPEAKER_15]: Excuse me, listen to the entire thing first.

01:34:40.537 --> 01:34:41.418
[SPEAKER_15]: I was not added.

01:34:41.558 --> 01:34:46.601
[SPEAKER_15]: I am a creator of not only the podcast, but of our three-hour live show, which we've been running for three years.

01:34:47.722 --> 01:34:48.862
[SPEAKER_15]: Besides, Rob is the giggling girl.

01:34:50.819 --> 01:34:51.659
[SPEAKER_18]: That's fine, that's fine.

01:34:52.060 --> 01:34:55.921
[SPEAKER_18]: And our chatroom, once you post that, our chatroom wants a link to that.

01:34:56.021 --> 01:34:57.162
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, somebody actually found it.

01:34:57.782 --> 01:34:58.262
[SPEAKER_18]: That was nice.

01:34:58.983 --> 01:35:01.043
[SPEAKER_18]: Wow, look at our listeners.

01:35:01.184 --> 01:35:01.884
[SPEAKER_18]: Look at them go.

01:35:02.424 --> 01:35:05.365
[SPEAKER_18]: They totally found that without us having to link them to it.

01:35:05.385 --> 01:35:07.326
[SPEAKER_18]: They just got on the net and started searching and looking.

01:35:07.947 --> 01:35:08.347
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, great.

01:35:08.387 --> 01:35:15.730
[SPEAKER_18]: Now the listeners are going to... That's all right.

01:35:16.684 --> 01:35:17.845
[SPEAKER_18]: Just remember, it's just some guy.

01:35:18.726 --> 01:35:20.748
[SPEAKER_18]: It's just some stupid kid.

01:35:23.832 --> 01:35:25.433
[SPEAKER_18]: Just be careful with what you say.

01:35:25.453 --> 01:35:27.155
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course, then again, you know what?

01:35:27.175 --> 01:35:28.056
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the worst that's going to happen?

01:35:28.397 --> 01:35:30.158
[SPEAKER_18]: More people decide to download our show.

01:35:30.599 --> 01:35:31.019
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn.

01:35:32.121 --> 01:35:32.221
Damn.

01:35:32.761 --> 01:35:33.202
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn.

01:35:36.414 --> 01:35:37.034
[SPEAKER_17]: All right.

01:35:37.234 --> 01:35:41.677
[SPEAKER_17]: I want to mention also that we were voted number one game podcast in podcast awards.

01:35:42.137 --> 01:35:46.999
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, somebody please go into the chat room and mention, not chat room, but on that site and mention that because I forgot to.

01:35:47.019 --> 01:35:51.781
[SPEAKER_18]: It doesn't matter.

01:35:51.801 --> 01:35:52.302
[SPEAKER_17]: It's on gig.

01:35:52.342 --> 01:35:53.642
[SPEAKER_18]: It's like four pages back.

01:35:53.722 --> 01:35:54.763
[SPEAKER_18]: Our Skype line is open.

01:35:54.783 --> 01:35:56.564
[SPEAKER_18]: OrangeSoundsRadio.com.

01:35:56.584 --> 01:35:57.804
[SPEAKER_18]: Click on interact with us.

01:35:58.184 --> 01:36:02.426
[SPEAKER_18]: And right now our Skype list is kind of interesting because it says six over 66.

01:36:03.959 --> 01:36:07.581
[SPEAKER_18]: So six people are online out of 66 that we have on our buddy list there.

01:36:08.342 --> 01:36:09.222
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know, 666?

01:36:09.262 --> 01:36:09.502
[SPEAKER_18]: Get it?

01:36:09.623 --> 01:36:10.243
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

01:36:13.965 --> 01:36:14.866
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what's interesting, though?

01:36:15.526 --> 01:36:28.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Even though we are the best gaming podcast, according to the podcastwords.com, iTunes this week featured 16 gaming podcasts on their front page in a gamers strike back type category.

01:36:29.215 --> 01:36:30.095
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio?

01:36:30.916 --> 01:36:31.476
[SPEAKER_18]: Not one of them.

01:36:33.120 --> 01:36:34.981
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, iTunes has so much wrong with it.

01:36:35.221 --> 01:36:37.982
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, we were on there before as well, too, so at least we can say that.

01:36:38.042 --> 01:36:41.563
[SPEAKER_18]: We were on as an interesting indie a while ago, so we can't complain too much.

01:36:42.003 --> 01:36:43.564
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have the word game in our title.

01:36:44.604 --> 01:36:46.685
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Loki, hurry up your quick thought, because we've got a call on the line.

01:36:46.845 --> 01:36:47.345
[SPEAKER_17]: No, go ahead.

01:36:47.365 --> 01:36:47.726
[SPEAKER_17]: Take the call.

01:36:47.746 --> 01:36:48.626
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're going to take the call.

01:36:48.666 --> 01:36:49.626
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:36:51.127 --> 01:36:52.267
[SPEAKER_18]: You already know who this is?

01:36:52.507 --> 01:36:52.988
[SPEAKER_18]: Of course.

01:36:53.048 --> 01:36:53.628
[SPEAKER_18]: Hi, Saku.

01:36:53.648 --> 01:36:54.008
[SPEAKER_18]: How are you?

01:36:55.288 --> 01:36:55.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Fine.

01:36:55.709 --> 01:36:56.369
[SPEAKER_12]: What's on your mind?

01:36:57.969 --> 01:37:00.391
[SPEAKER_12]: Just seeing that DDR Strike is no joke now.

01:37:00.931 --> 01:37:04.834
[SPEAKER_12]: Obviously, you already heard Love is Orange.

01:37:04.854 --> 01:37:05.935
[SPEAKER_12]: That's all I have to say.

01:37:06.095 --> 01:37:08.236
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, Love is Orange is going to be in DDR Strike.

01:37:08.376 --> 01:37:09.097
[SPEAKER_18]: Very interesting.

01:37:11.078 --> 01:37:13.220
[SPEAKER_18]: We finally got some Oni steps.

01:37:13.400 --> 01:37:14.721
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that's kind of cool as well.

01:37:15.201 --> 01:37:19.504
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, what could be interesting is that we haven't really heard of a lot of...

01:37:19.724 --> 01:37:22.405
[SPEAKER_18]: and Konami Originals that are going to be in EX2.

01:37:22.445 --> 01:37:23.705
[SPEAKER_18]: We've heard of all these licensed songs.

01:37:23.745 --> 01:37:26.306
[SPEAKER_18]: We haven't heard a lot of Konami Originals besides the one shown in E3.

01:37:26.326 --> 01:37:33.608
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, because Konami learned, you know, Konami learned that if stuff is leaked beforehand, you know, people start bitching and moaning.

01:37:33.668 --> 01:37:34.208
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

01:37:34.228 --> 01:37:40.170
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's why they're keeping, yeah, that's why we haven't gotten, you know, that many Ultramix 3 songs, you know, song names yet.

01:37:40.190 --> 01:37:42.290
[SPEAKER_18]: Zaku, I absolutely agree with you on that.

01:37:42.330 --> 01:37:46.031
[SPEAKER_18]: Believe it or not, I absolutely agree that that's the reason why Konami is keeping it under wraps.

01:37:46.111 --> 01:37:47.812
[SPEAKER_18]: They're keeping it under wraps so you don't bitch about it.

01:37:49.122 --> 01:37:52.124
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, that's basically how you do it.

01:37:52.164 --> 01:37:57.267
[SPEAKER_12]: You wait until the right moment, and in this case, DDR Extreme 2 should be coming out next week.

01:37:57.987 --> 01:38:00.469
[SPEAKER_12]: So then we'll probably know what's going to be on it.

01:38:00.489 --> 01:38:01.470
[SPEAKER_18]: My god, is it really next week?

01:38:01.950 --> 01:38:02.410
[SPEAKER_18]: Next week?

01:38:02.610 --> 01:38:03.251
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, nope.

01:38:03.851 --> 01:38:04.111
[SPEAKER_18]: Two weeks.

01:38:04.131 --> 01:38:05.972
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I think it's the 27th.

01:38:05.992 --> 01:38:07.593
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, that's two weeks.

01:38:07.973 --> 01:38:09.554
[SPEAKER_18]: By my calendar, it's two weeks.

01:38:09.594 --> 01:38:12.196
[SPEAKER_17]: I gotta give my call to have them send me a copy.

01:38:12.276 --> 01:38:13.537
[SPEAKER_17]: I thought it was the 27th, come on.

01:38:16.368 --> 01:38:16.609
[SPEAKER_18]: WTF!

01:38:16.849 --> 01:38:17.069
[SPEAKER_18]: WTF!

01:38:46.188 --> 01:38:49.749
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, here it is, here it is, Zaku.

01:38:49.969 --> 01:38:57.752
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that in order to separate themselves from Sony and Microsoft, they've got to take a gamble and try something different.

01:38:58.112 --> 01:38:59.052
[SPEAKER_18]: And I think that's what they're doing.

01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:01.253
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it going to be a good thing or a bad thing?

01:39:01.493 --> 01:39:02.013
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

01:39:02.293 --> 01:39:03.694
[SPEAKER_18]: Will they put Kid Icarus on it?

01:39:03.814 --> 01:39:04.654
[SPEAKER_18]: That's my thing.

01:39:08.455 --> 01:39:09.135
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I know, I know.

01:39:09.395 --> 01:39:14.657
[SPEAKER_12]: How would you, I mean, I could understand, I could understand the control being used as a gun.

01:39:15.481 --> 01:39:21.026
[SPEAKER_12]: Just for, you know, for shooter games, but, you know, fighting games, I really, you really need something.

01:39:21.266 --> 01:39:29.274
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the little sticky part that looks like a remote control, turn it 90 degrees, and it looks just like an old school NES controller.

01:39:30.942 --> 01:39:31.743
[SPEAKER_18]: Except thinner.

01:39:32.684 --> 01:39:33.104
[SPEAKER_10]: Think about it.

01:39:33.144 --> 01:39:34.305
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, take the remote.

01:39:34.605 --> 01:39:34.926
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously.

01:39:35.726 --> 01:39:38.509
[SPEAKER_18]: And I credit absolutely DarkTetsuya with pointing this out to me.

01:39:38.889 --> 01:39:40.471
[SPEAKER_18]: Take the remote, turn it 90 degrees.

01:39:40.491 --> 01:39:41.572
[SPEAKER_12]: You want us to play sideways?

01:39:41.592 --> 01:39:42.192
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god.

01:39:42.573 --> 01:39:43.193
[SPEAKER_12]: So there you go.

01:39:44.034 --> 01:39:46.596
[SPEAKER_18]: As I said, I'm just going for PS3.

01:39:46.656 --> 01:39:48.758
[SPEAKER_18]: Money's all in there right now.

01:39:48.979 --> 01:39:52.462
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm actually, believe it or not, I'm picking up an Xbox 360.

01:39:52.602 --> 01:39:53.463
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to have all of them.

01:39:54.924 --> 01:39:57.665
[SPEAKER_18]: I know I will too eventually.

01:39:57.705 --> 01:40:04.248
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be really hard to hack PS3 because Blu-ray is pretty tight up the ass.

01:40:04.288 --> 01:40:08.430
[SPEAKER_12]: Blu-ray is going to be damn near impossible to... But that's what they said about DVD.

01:40:08.751 --> 01:40:11.432
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly, that's what they said about DVD.

01:40:12.813 --> 01:40:21.117
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, but from what we're seeing, it looks like they've pretty much fixed all the loopholes that DVD had.

01:40:21.747 --> 01:40:27.729
[SPEAKER_12]: In other words, Blu-ray was supposed to be something a lot better than DVD.

01:40:27.989 --> 01:40:32.951
[SPEAKER_12]: It was supposed to be almost invincible and perfect in that sense.

01:40:33.772 --> 01:40:35.172
[SPEAKER_18]: But, you know, not everything's perfect.

01:40:35.192 --> 01:40:35.752
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, we'll see.

01:40:36.012 --> 01:40:38.714
[SPEAKER_18]: If there is a way to crack it, somehow the hacking world will.

01:40:38.734 --> 01:40:39.194
[SPEAKER_18]: But we'll see.

01:40:39.294 --> 01:40:39.614
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll see.

01:40:40.414 --> 01:40:41.495
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, any other thoughts, Daku?

01:40:41.515 --> 01:40:44.156
[SPEAKER_18]: Because we've got to go pretty quick here so we can get some other people in before the cage match.

01:40:44.756 --> 01:40:45.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Anything else?

01:40:47.216 --> 01:40:47.476
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello?

01:40:48.317 --> 01:40:50.599
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, I guess that's about it so far.

01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:52.861
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Strike equals Oni, that's it.

01:40:53.182 --> 01:40:54.002
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, we'll see.

01:40:54.063 --> 01:40:55.304
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one, Zaku.

01:40:55.324 --> 01:40:57.306
[SPEAKER_18]: DDR Extreme 2 next week, let's go.

01:40:57.706 --> 01:40:59.127
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, later.

01:41:01.369 --> 01:41:02.030
[SPEAKER_18]: That kid's fun.

01:41:02.130 --> 01:41:03.592
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's go to another call here.

01:41:03.932 --> 01:41:05.033
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:41:05.954 --> 01:41:07.435
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey, this is SSJ100 Matt.

01:41:07.475 --> 01:41:09.277
[SPEAKER_18]: Hello, SSJ100 Matt, what's on your mind?

01:41:12.828 --> 01:41:14.750
[SPEAKER_24]: I just wanted to talk about the Revolution Controller.

01:41:14.890 --> 01:41:15.630
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, what's up?

01:41:15.810 --> 01:41:17.232
[SPEAKER_18]: What's your thoughts on the Revolution Controller?

01:41:18.813 --> 01:41:22.896
[SPEAKER_24]: Just basically, it looks like everyone's Smash Brothers skills are going to be thrown out the window with this thing.

01:41:23.697 --> 01:41:31.122
[SPEAKER_18]: But what about the little mock-up that Loki posted where you can plug the little remote thingy into a Wave Bird type controller?

01:41:31.162 --> 01:41:33.344
[SPEAKER_18]: I mean, that'll be just like a GameCube.

01:41:33.664 --> 01:41:36.326
[SPEAKER_23]: Do you know that when you throw it out the window, it will know when you throw it out the window.

01:41:36.647 --> 01:41:37.908
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up, Bug.

01:41:37.948 --> 01:41:38.228
[SPEAKER_24]: Shut up.

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:45.994
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, it's possible, but you know, if you're going to go to a tournament, you're just going to see a lot of people just wailing around a remote control, trying to wave dash.

01:41:46.254 --> 01:41:54.856
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but this is a Star Wars fan's dream right there, because the controller can be a lightsaber in future Star Wars games.

01:41:54.936 --> 01:42:02.957
[SPEAKER_17]: And then, you know, you can just go around that... Then they'll have Revolutionary Controller, or Revolution Controller Kid videos going around.

01:42:02.977 --> 01:42:06.998
[SPEAKER_24]: And then they'll get his own... You know what it looks like?

01:42:07.018 --> 01:42:08.378
[SPEAKER_24]: It looks like a Star Trek phaser.

01:42:10.706 --> 01:42:11.387
[SPEAKER_20]: Kinda.

01:42:11.487 --> 01:42:12.928
[SPEAKER_20]: Whoa, old school flashback time.

01:42:12.968 --> 01:42:13.188
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

01:42:13.548 --> 01:42:15.049
[SPEAKER_20]: Who remembers Die by the Sword?

01:42:15.990 --> 01:42:16.370
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't.

01:42:17.090 --> 01:42:29.839
[SPEAKER_20]: It was this first person hack and slash game where either you use the mouse to control literally the sword arm, and you can just slice, hack and slash with that sword by moving the mouse or with a joystick.

01:42:30.759 --> 01:42:35.563
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm thinking there were going to be some damn good sword fighting games, like say that Dragon Warrior...

01:42:37.339 --> 01:42:38.641
[SPEAKER_20]: I know, but the possibility is endless.

01:42:38.681 --> 01:42:38.881
[SPEAKER_20]: I hope.

01:42:52.409 --> 01:42:53.669
[SPEAKER_17]: Let's just call this what this is.

01:42:53.689 --> 01:42:57.810
[SPEAKER_17]: This is what happens when, you know, the Power Glove has sex with a remote control.

01:42:58.431 --> 01:42:58.951
[SPEAKER_17]: The end.

01:42:59.111 --> 01:42:59.891
[SPEAKER_17]: That's what it is.

01:43:00.031 --> 01:43:03.792
[SPEAKER_18]: You know what the Nintendo controller looks like to me?

01:43:04.112 --> 01:43:07.873
[SPEAKER_18]: Like if you disconnected that one portion of it, it would look like a tampon.

01:43:08.693 --> 01:43:10.394
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, with the little, with the cord.

01:43:10.634 --> 01:43:12.354
[SPEAKER_14]: That doesn't look like a tampon.

01:43:12.374 --> 01:43:15.675
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, forget it.

01:43:15.755 --> 01:43:17.795
[SPEAKER_17]: Tampons don't have two A and B buttons.

01:43:18.656 --> 01:43:19.156
[SPEAKER_17]: Forget it.

01:43:19.596 --> 01:43:20.036
[SPEAKER_18]: Forget it.

01:43:23.676 --> 01:43:27.218
[SPEAKER_18]: SSJ100, Matt, any other thoughts on things you've heard about at Tokyo Game Show?

01:43:28.439 --> 01:43:35.863
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, like you, I'm also a little disappointed that the Revolution may or may not have HD capabilities on it.

01:43:35.883 --> 01:43:39.186
[SPEAKER_18]: You have caught me bitching about this in the forums incessantly.

01:43:39.246 --> 01:43:40.727
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, I was... 480p.

01:43:41.267 --> 01:43:48.892
[SPEAKER_18]: Somebody created something in the forums about the Nintendo Revolution and the controller and everything, and my immediate response was...

01:43:49.614 --> 01:43:50.014
[SPEAKER_18]: Was that you?

01:43:50.054 --> 01:43:50.354
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm sorry.

01:43:51.535 --> 01:43:55.137
[SPEAKER_18]: My immediate response in the forum was something to the effect of, you know what?

01:43:55.257 --> 01:43:56.358
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't care about the controller.

01:43:56.418 --> 01:43:59.660
[SPEAKER_18]: My bitch about Nintendo Revolution right now is that there's no HD support.

01:44:00.700 --> 01:44:10.806
[SPEAKER_18]: And as somebody who's an HD TV owner, as I think a lot of Americans will be over the next three years, what the F?

01:44:10.846 --> 01:44:14.448
[SPEAKER_18]: How can you be a next-gen system and not support the next-gen picture technology?

01:44:14.609 --> 01:44:15.809
[SPEAKER_18]: I do not understand that at all.

01:44:16.270 --> 01:44:17.030
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, you know, praise...

01:44:18.496 --> 01:44:19.676
[SPEAKER_24]: Soon everything's going to be HD.

01:44:19.716 --> 01:44:21.937
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I've actually shot on HD cameras.

01:44:22.477 --> 01:44:22.997
[SPEAKER_18]: Ooh, cool.

01:44:24.797 --> 01:44:28.338
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I actually use the same... You there?

01:44:28.578 --> 01:44:29.038
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I'm here.

01:44:29.058 --> 01:44:35.299
[SPEAKER_18]: I was just going to say, just earlier tonight, my roommate was watching the Emmys pre-show on the HD channel.

01:44:35.739 --> 01:44:39.260
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, okay, who cares about Star Jones and HD?

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:42.481
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's out there now, so soon everything will be on HD.

01:44:42.521 --> 01:44:43.161
[SPEAKER_18]: It's inevitable.

01:44:44.041 --> 01:44:44.181
[SPEAKER_24]: Yeah.

01:44:45.813 --> 01:44:49.314
[SPEAKER_24]: I've actually used the same exact camera that they used on episode 3.

01:44:50.274 --> 01:44:51.034
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, very cool.

01:44:54.155 --> 01:44:59.496
[SPEAKER_24]: HD is not really any much different than regular, like digital wise, it's fine.

01:45:03.017 --> 01:45:07.217
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, little known fact, actually when I was in college I also studied television.

01:45:07.277 --> 01:45:10.438
[SPEAKER_18]: Television was my major, media arts, communication design.

01:45:11.164 --> 01:45:17.286
[SPEAKER_18]: was my major, so I played a lot with cameras when I was in college, too, and did a lot of studio work, and worked for a TV station for a short time.

01:45:18.887 --> 01:45:19.907
[SPEAKER_24]: That's what I'm working on now.

01:45:20.067 --> 01:45:20.447
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:45:21.168 --> 01:45:21.468
[SPEAKER_18]: Very cool.

01:45:21.508 --> 01:45:24.369
[SPEAKER_24]: I mean, I actually applied to G4 last week.

01:45:24.849 --> 01:45:25.589
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, that's right.

01:45:25.629 --> 01:45:26.770
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember reading something.

01:45:27.390 --> 01:45:28.230
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck with that.

01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:32.512
[SPEAKER_18]: If you get in to work for the man, don't forget about us little people.

01:45:33.612 --> 01:45:39.435
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, actually, I'm working for a TV show out here, but for the time being, I'm hoping G4 contacts me.

01:45:39.595 --> 01:45:39.915
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, cool.

01:45:39.955 --> 01:45:40.495
[SPEAKER_18]: Good luck with that.

01:45:40.888 --> 01:45:41.709
[SPEAKER_18]: See you in LA, maybe.

01:45:43.110 --> 01:45:43.390
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:45:43.430 --> 01:45:43.631
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

01:45:44.431 --> 01:45:47.434
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, well, anyway, SSJ100, Matt, is there anything else you'd like to share with us tonight?

01:45:48.435 --> 01:45:48.715
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, nope.

01:45:48.976 --> 01:45:49.216
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:45:49.236 --> 01:45:53.320
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, then we're going to let you go, see if we get any other calls, and move on to the cage match, all right?

01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:53.820
[SPEAKER_18]: Have a good one.

01:45:54.601 --> 01:45:55.362
[SPEAKER_18]: Yep, you too, bye.

01:45:55.462 --> 01:45:55.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Later.

01:45:56.423 --> 01:45:59.045
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, more feedback there on the Nintendo Revolution controller.

01:46:00.166 --> 01:46:00.767
[SPEAKER_18]: And, uh...

01:46:01.525 --> 01:46:10.888
[SPEAKER_18]: A lot, a lot of people, just on the blogging scene out there, everybody that's got some type of gaming blog in one way or another has some... What guy?

01:46:12.388 --> 01:46:13.269
[SPEAKER_18]: He's not online right now.

01:46:14.209 --> 01:46:14.949
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, no, me.

01:46:15.009 --> 01:46:16.910
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I thought you were pointing out somebody else on the list.

01:46:19.350 --> 01:46:25.492
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, I don't see any other calls coming in, so I think we're going to go ahead and we don't want to run too behind in the show anyway.

01:46:25.512 --> 01:46:28.353
[SPEAKER_18]: We got to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

01:46:34.526 --> 01:46:35.328
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio

01:46:46.885 --> 01:47:11.805

01:47:12.145 --> 01:47:15.786
[SPEAKER_18]: of last week's winner because it's assumed that you've already heard the song in its entirety.

01:47:16.306 --> 01:47:19.387
[SPEAKER_18]: And then we're going to play two more songs for you guys in full.

01:47:19.687 --> 01:47:21.267

01:47:23.968 --> 01:47:31.810
[SPEAKER_18]: And let's get it started here with a clip of song number one, Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Coot with Blame, the trance mix.

01:48:19.303 --> 01:48:19.824
Thanks for watching!

01:48:46.806 --> 01:48:47.710
Thanks for watching!

01:50:06.498 --> 01:50:08.800
[SPEAKER_18]: Alrighty, that was song number one in tonight's Cage Match.

01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:11.762
[SPEAKER_18]: That was Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Coot with Blame.

01:50:11.863 --> 01:50:15.666
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's get into some new songs and see what kind of competition Blame has tonight.

01:50:16.086 --> 01:50:18.468
[SPEAKER_18]: The first one is DarkSakura's pick.

01:50:18.508 --> 01:50:20.269
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, what did you pick and why?

01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:26.114
[SPEAKER_15]: I really like Wanga's Midnight Maximum tune a whole bunch and the music in it is awesome.

01:50:26.534 --> 01:50:31.458
[SPEAKER_15]: So this one is Yuzuko Shiro with Destination Blackout.

01:50:31.638 --> 01:50:32.399
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just a really cool song.

01:50:33.067 --> 01:50:36.690
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so this was not in tonight's pre-show because this is from the first game, right?

01:50:36.710 --> 01:50:38.031
[SPEAKER_15]: This is on the first soundtrack.

01:50:38.112 --> 01:50:38.372
[SPEAKER_15]: Alright.

01:50:38.392 --> 01:50:38.932
[SPEAKER_15]: The first CD.

01:50:39.012 --> 01:50:39.353
[SPEAKER_18]: Sounds good.

01:50:39.913 --> 01:50:42.335
[SPEAKER_18]: Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

01:50:42.415 --> 01:50:42.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

01:50:43.877 --> 01:50:44.577
Be quiet.

01:50:44.717 --> 01:50:45.378
Unknown.

01:50:45.458 --> 01:50:46.018
Out of space.

01:50:46.038 --> 01:50:46.939
Destination Blackout.

01:50:46.979 --> 01:50:47.219
One, two.

01:51:55.588 --> 01:51:55.991
Dream Seed

01:52:33.201 --> 01:52:33.862
Don't forget now!

01:52:34.123 --> 01:52:34.984
No more enemies!

01:54:19.657 --> 01:54:21.118
Thanks for watching!

01:55:00.010 --> 01:55:00.571
One, two, three.

01:55:36.483 --> 01:55:41.945
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, song number two in tonight's cage match, Yuzo Koshiro from Wangan Midnight Maximum Tune.

01:55:42.205 --> 01:55:43.906
[SPEAKER_18]: That was Destination Blackout.

01:55:44.146 --> 01:55:45.407
[SPEAKER_18]: What did you kids think of that?

01:55:45.427 --> 01:55:46.467
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll start off with DarkSakura.

01:55:46.487 --> 01:55:54.290
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, I'm normally not a trance person at all, but this made me think of almost like taking symphonic music and syncing it up.

01:55:54.970 --> 01:55:55.710
[SPEAKER_15]: And I really like it.

01:55:55.770 --> 01:55:56.631
[SPEAKER_15]: I really, really like it.

01:55:56.671 --> 01:55:57.871
[SPEAKER_15]: I love all the music in the game.

01:55:57.911 --> 01:56:00.472
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot more fun to play that game stat instead of Eurobeat.

01:56:01.092 --> 01:56:02.193
[SPEAKER_15]: So it gets a 9.5.

01:56:03.013 --> 01:56:03.653
[SPEAKER_18]: 9.5 out of 10.

01:56:03.854 --> 01:56:04.694
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's Yuzo Koshiro.

01:56:04.714 --> 01:56:04.994
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like

01:56:05.504 --> 01:56:06.144
[SPEAKER_15]: Angel, Jackass, Angel

01:56:34.468 --> 01:56:35.048
[SPEAKER_11]: Good stuff.

01:56:37.130 --> 01:56:37.570
[SPEAKER_11]: Nine.

01:56:38.490 --> 01:56:38.791
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

01:56:38.871 --> 01:56:41.372
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't, like... Well, maybe I could give it a ten.

01:56:41.392 --> 01:56:41.652
[SPEAKER_11]: A nine.

01:56:42.073 --> 01:56:43.414
[SPEAKER_20]: A nine from Angel.

01:56:43.534 --> 01:56:44.214
[SPEAKER_18]: Almost a ten.

01:56:44.354 --> 01:56:44.694
[SPEAKER_20]: Magus.

01:56:45.215 --> 01:56:48.437
[SPEAKER_20]: Used to hearing it all the time, so... I don't know.

01:56:49.037 --> 01:56:51.358
[SPEAKER_20]: I like it, but I hear too much of it.

01:56:51.398 --> 01:56:52.379
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll try to be unbiased.

01:56:52.559 --> 01:56:52.859
[SPEAKER_20]: Nine.

01:56:53.500 --> 01:56:54.560
[SPEAKER_20]: All right.

01:56:54.640 --> 01:56:55.201
[SPEAKER_20]: My thoughts.

01:56:56.341 --> 01:56:56.862
[SPEAKER_18]: I liked it.

01:56:56.922 --> 01:56:57.422
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool.

01:56:57.482 --> 01:57:01.965
[SPEAKER_18]: It was the kind of song... It did get a little bit repetitive, which is odd because a lot of trance is repetitive, but...

01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:31.165
[SPEAKER_18]: it got a little repetitive for me but it was like a cool song like I could imagine myself driving down the road to that song except I would want guns on my car like in Spy Hunter and I'm kind of frustrated that I don't actually have guns on my car so all in all I don't know why I brought that up but I want to be able to shoot things from my car well if you do have guns in your car you're gonna want the Peter Gunn theme but that song works too I didn't realize he did Revenge of Shinobi 2 dude he did a lot of great music anyway he did Actraiser?

01:57:32.321 --> 01:57:33.002
[SPEAKER_18]: That's sweet.

01:57:33.222 --> 01:57:39.086
[SPEAKER_15]: I knew that he did Shenmue and Streets of Rage and Sonic the Hedgehog, but I didn't realize he did Actrozer.

01:57:40.207 --> 01:57:42.348
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, Destination Blackout gets a nine from me.

01:57:42.389 --> 01:57:42.889
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that song.

01:57:42.909 --> 01:57:43.269
[SPEAKER_18]: It's pretty cool.

01:57:43.289 --> 01:57:45.071
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, let's get into the last pick.

01:57:45.111 --> 01:57:48.113
[SPEAKER_18]: It's my song tonight, and I don't know.

01:57:48.333 --> 01:57:51.335
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got two video game songs up tonight, but you know what?

01:57:51.395 --> 01:57:53.657
[SPEAKER_18]: I think that we should have something else.

01:57:54.492 --> 01:57:55.374
[SPEAKER_18]: Something else in the cage match.

01:57:55.394 --> 01:57:57.356
[SPEAKER_18]: So I went really kind of random tonight.

01:57:57.837 --> 01:58:02.202
[SPEAKER_18]: And this is a brand new synth pop song that's on a different drum site.

01:58:02.523 --> 01:58:03.744
[SPEAKER_18]: And so I had to check this one out.

01:58:03.804 --> 01:58:04.705
[SPEAKER_18]: And it's not in English.

01:58:05.066 --> 01:58:05.847
[SPEAKER_18]: So it should be interesting.

01:58:06.167 --> 01:58:11.214
[SPEAKER_18]: This is Silica Gel with Nada Es Eterno here on Orange Lounge Radio, song number three.

01:58:20.572 --> 01:58:25.320
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if he kisses us, nobody is perfect Nothing is eternal

01:58:48.286 --> 01:58:53.888
[SPEAKER_06]: How many nights, your lies, deceived me in every smile.

01:58:53.908 --> 01:58:57.289
[SPEAKER_06]: The caresses were not for me, your hands were now empty.

01:58:57.309 --> 01:59:02.211
[SPEAKER_06]: You have lost credibility, your kisses are no longer immortal.

01:59:39.625 --> 01:59:40.345
S, Actdeft, S, Actdeft

02:00:05.453 --> 02:00:24.861
[SPEAKER_06]: Fueron a caer en mundos paralelos instantes No guardé rencor, no convertí en mi fe Poderte comprender Nada es eterno, aunque nos vende Nadie es perfecto

02:02:00.598 --> 02:02:05.461
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, that was song number three in tonight's cage match, Silica Gel with Nada Es Eterno.

02:02:05.701 --> 02:02:07.522
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's see what the hosts thought of that one.

02:02:07.562 --> 02:02:08.122
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.

02:02:09.643 --> 02:02:15.146
[SPEAKER_15]: What bothered me is I couldn't tell what language that was in because I didn't know if it was Spanish or Italian.

02:02:15.966 --> 02:02:17.147
[SPEAKER_18]: We're pretty sure it's Spanish.

02:02:17.827 --> 02:02:18.948
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's Spanish.

02:02:19.328 --> 02:02:23.750
[SPEAKER_15]: But either way, I was baffled, and so bafflement takes the one from the score.

02:02:24.451 --> 02:02:25.651
[SPEAKER_15]: It was pretty good, though, overall.

02:02:26.752 --> 02:02:27.252
[SPEAKER_15]: So it gets an eight.

02:02:27.832 --> 02:02:28.093
[SPEAKER_18]: An eight.

02:02:28.573 --> 02:02:28.773
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

02:02:28.793 --> 02:02:28.893
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

02:02:30.812 --> 02:02:33.414
[SPEAKER_18]: Um... Ocho from DarkSakura.

02:02:33.614 --> 02:02:34.034
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

02:02:35.755 --> 02:02:37.456
[SPEAKER_17]: I didn't really care for it at seven.

02:02:38.977 --> 02:02:42.519
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Siete from Loki.

02:02:44.340 --> 02:02:44.641
[SPEAKER_18]: Seis.

02:02:45.721 --> 02:02:46.121
[SPEAKER_18]: Seis.

02:02:48.963 --> 02:02:49.323
[SPEAKER_19]: Catchy.

02:02:49.363 --> 02:02:50.504
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to buck the trend here.

02:02:50.884 --> 02:02:53.106
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to give it an eight.

02:02:53.166 --> 02:02:54.627
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pretty good, pretty catchy.

02:02:55.987 --> 02:02:56.808
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty, uh...

02:02:57.549 --> 02:02:58.210
[SPEAKER_19]: Pretty Lively.

02:02:58.590 --> 02:02:59.190
[SPEAKER_18]: Ocho!

02:02:59.491 --> 02:03:00.812
[SPEAKER_18]: From, uh... I hate you.

02:03:04.254 --> 02:03:07.037
[SPEAKER_18]: From, uh... 23, I think?

02:03:07.577 --> 02:03:07.037
23?

02:03:08.258 --> 02:03:08.618
[SPEAKER_18]: Magus?

02:03:08.818 --> 02:03:09.138
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:03:09.679 --> 02:03:10.019
[SPEAKER_18]: Guy.

02:03:11.080 --> 02:03:12.741
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh... Nueve, for me.

02:03:12.901 --> 02:03:13.862
[SPEAKER_23]: Nueve, I like it.

02:03:13.882 --> 02:03:18.886
[SPEAKER_23]: The only language I can count in other than English, well, other than, like, Apple Map, is German.

02:03:19.727 --> 02:03:20.567
[SPEAKER_18]: I like that song.

02:03:20.627 --> 02:03:21.208
[SPEAKER_18]: It was cool.

02:03:21.288 --> 02:03:21.948
[SPEAKER_18]: So it gets a 9.

02:03:22.168 --> 02:03:26.632
[SPEAKER_18]: I think it's just kind of... It's very, like... It's got a strong beat to it.

02:03:27.202 --> 02:03:28.703
[SPEAKER_18]: I like the strong beat in that song.

02:03:29.303 --> 02:03:39.748
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's go and see what the chatroom thought by allowing them to vote after this quick montage of the three songs you can vote for tonight.

02:03:40.528 --> 02:03:44.390
[SPEAKER_18]: Song number one tonight, Good Cool with Chorus K and Jeff Coot with Blame.

02:03:55.285 --> 02:04:14.561
[SPEAKER_18]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout And song number three you can vote for tonight is Silica Gel with Nada S. Eterno

02:04:23.670 --> 02:04:27.253
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, place vote now.

02:04:27.413 --> 02:04:36.701
[SPEAKER_18]: Send us a private message in the chat room to Sky with your vote for song number uno, song numero dos, or song numero tres.

02:04:37.462 --> 02:04:38.083
[SPEAKER_18]: Place vote now.

02:04:40.044 --> 02:04:40.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:04:41.437 --> 02:04:47.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Meanwhile, we get into the part of the show where Loki tells us what's going on in the simulation scene.

02:04:47.422 --> 02:04:56.590
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, the Dance Dance Revolution simulation scene and other music games where you can download and simulate the music games for free on your PC.

02:04:56.710 --> 02:04:57.671
[SPEAKER_17]: Damn straight.

02:04:58.552 --> 02:05:01.995
[SPEAKER_17]: Of course, what we've been waiting for, Food Mix 2 has arrived.

02:05:03.296 --> 02:05:06.278
[SPEAKER_17]: It's unfortunately only in one format.

02:05:06.298 --> 02:05:07.239
[SPEAKER_17]: You can only download it in...

02:05:09.218 --> 02:05:12.720
[SPEAKER_17]: A set with basically Food Mix 1, Food Mix Plus, and Food Mix 2.

02:05:13.761 --> 02:05:16.262
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's a 1.2 gig download for you.

02:05:17.383 --> 02:05:21.485
[SPEAKER_18]: Wait, so it's Food Mix 1, 2, and... Yeah, it's 1, Plus, and 2.

02:05:21.845 --> 02:05:22.506
[SPEAKER_17]: Wow, okay.

02:05:23.546 --> 02:05:32.872
[SPEAKER_17]: And basically what they've done is they've changed all the animations in the background to just one video clip now instead of having all the fancy stuff that they were doing before.

02:05:34.162 --> 02:05:36.623
[SPEAKER_17]: But, I have to say, it's really cool.

02:05:37.023 --> 02:05:44.106
[SPEAKER_17]: The music this time around, though, a lot of it, I'm not too... I don't like it too much, but it's pretty good still.

02:05:44.427 --> 02:05:45.947
[SPEAKER_17]: And the animation is just amazing.

02:05:46.187 --> 02:05:48.428
[SPEAKER_17]: They've really just outdone themselves.

02:05:49.309 --> 02:05:54.431
[SPEAKER_17]: And the other thing, though, is they have a bunch of really strange stuff that's in there.

02:05:54.451 --> 02:05:57.672
[SPEAKER_17]: It kind of reminded me of old Moogle Hunter sim files.

02:05:58.053 --> 02:05:58.673
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really...

02:05:59.801 --> 02:06:04.125
[SPEAKER_17]: Really strange stuff that catches you off guard like steps appearing out of nowhere and stuff like that.

02:06:04.625 --> 02:06:06.807
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's interesting.

02:06:06.827 --> 02:06:07.607
[SPEAKER_17]: You've got to check it out.

02:06:08.868 --> 02:06:13.672
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have the link on our front page there, so definitely go check it out.

02:06:14.553 --> 02:06:14.793
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:06:15.194 --> 02:06:15.654
[SPEAKER_18]: Check that out.

02:06:17.539 --> 02:06:24.568
[SPEAKER_18]: Also on the front page of OrangeLaunchRadio.com, something we hadn't mentioned yet until this point in the show, but I definitely want to make sure we get that out there.

02:06:24.748 --> 02:06:30.556
[SPEAKER_18]: It's something that we actually teamed up with another audio company in Sacramento, Dark Records.

02:06:31.277 --> 02:06:31.837
[SPEAKER_15]: And also...

02:06:32.678 --> 02:07:01.202
[SPEAKER_18]: Club 21, Rapture We're teaming up to do a fundraiser relief for Hurricane Katrina and kind of the concept behind this fundraiser is that we're not just trying to raise money for the human need but also the pet and animal need is kind of the little spin we're putting on it because I don't remember if it was you or Iguana Girl from DDR Freak slash Dark Record she works on as well that originally found the

02:07:01.912 --> 02:07:03.234
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

02:07:23.624 --> 02:07:35.469
[SPEAKER_15]: Any type of animal care items, bedding, to give to the shelters, to the people who are housing, who are providing foster homes for displaced pets.

02:07:38.351 --> 02:07:43.453
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a lot easier for people who may not have a whole lot of money to contribute in food.

02:07:44.533 --> 02:07:50.936
[SPEAKER_15]: Also, we are taking monetary donations for the human survivors as well.

02:07:51.957 --> 02:07:52.117
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll

02:07:52.977 --> 02:07:54.178
[SPEAKER_15]: Did you already post the link?

02:07:54.378 --> 02:07:56.779
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, if you visit OrangeLawnTrailer.com, you can't miss it.

02:07:56.819 --> 02:07:57.500
[SPEAKER_18]: There's a huge banner.

02:07:57.520 --> 02:07:58.040
[SPEAKER_15]: It's right up at the top.

02:07:58.120 --> 02:07:58.900
[SPEAKER_18]: It's right up at the top.

02:07:59.721 --> 02:08:06.985
[SPEAKER_15]: But they're taking donations via PayPal on the Dark Records site that's set up for the collection.

02:08:07.105 --> 02:08:21.093
[SPEAKER_15]: Anyone in the Sacramento area, if you go to Club 21 on Thursday nights for Rapture, which is the goth industrial night, there are donation boxes around for physical items as well as...

02:08:21.860 --> 02:08:22.881
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you for watching.

02:08:23.261 --> 02:08:24.062
[SPEAKER_15]: See you next time.

02:08:29.008 --> 02:08:33.369
[SPEAKER_15]: Get a fabulous garage sale.

02:08:33.869 --> 02:08:37.130
[SPEAKER_15]: And we are going to be selling off this stuff to the community.

02:08:37.730 --> 02:08:40.671
[SPEAKER_15]: And the money is going to be going directly to the Red Cross.

02:08:40.731 --> 02:08:44.572
[SPEAKER_15]: The leftover items are all going to the Salvation Army thrift store.

02:08:45.092 --> 02:08:47.633
[SPEAKER_15]: So everything donated will be put to use.

02:08:48.553 --> 02:08:53.094
[SPEAKER_15]: And if you have something specifically for animals, if the money you want to, you know,

02:08:53.720 --> 02:08:54.181
[SPEAKER_15]: www.DarkSakura.com

02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:09.282
[SPEAKER_15]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

02:09:32.304 --> 02:09:46.713
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so now it's a little easier if you're in the local area to really get involved with this by going out to Club Rapture, checking out the garage sale that we're going to do that we have more information on later on.

02:09:47.034 --> 02:09:53.518
[SPEAKER_18]: Not just Sacramento, but our neighboring areas as well, Bay Area, Stockton, Modesto, those areas as well can certainly get in on this.

02:09:54.238 --> 02:10:00.122
[SPEAKER_18]: Our worldwide folks, because we know we have a lot of people that listen through obviously our live shows as well as the podcasts,

02:10:00.731 --> 02:10:07.852
[SPEAKER_18]: We do have that monetary donation thing basically set up just for you guys so you guys can get involved in this as well.

02:10:07.892 --> 02:10:11.913
[SPEAKER_18]: So we really hope, you know, obviously we don't want to force you guys, but think about it.

02:10:11.993 --> 02:10:19.055
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'll tell you what, if you want to send something to donate, you know, if you want to send pet supplies our way, email me.

02:10:19.415 --> 02:10:20.855
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll get you my address.

02:10:21.235 --> 02:10:23.516
[SPEAKER_18]: Or you could just contact your local SPCA, too.

02:10:23.536 --> 02:10:24.316
[SPEAKER_18]: You could do that, too.

02:10:24.396 --> 02:10:25.536
[SPEAKER_15]: See if they're doing something similar.

02:10:25.576 --> 02:10:28.717
[SPEAKER_15]: As long as the money or the items go to help.

02:10:29.137 --> 02:10:29.317
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:10:30.556 --> 02:10:31.716
[SPEAKER_15]: That's all we're interested in.

02:10:32.177 --> 02:10:32.537
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

02:10:32.997 --> 02:10:34.717
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, so check that out on orangewatchradio.com.

02:10:34.737 --> 02:10:38.038
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be mentioning that again every week until this is over because it's an important cause.

02:10:38.358 --> 02:10:38.778
[SPEAKER_18]: Absolutely.

02:10:39.619 --> 02:10:42.760
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, we're going to go to a break, guys, and I'm going to tally up the votes from the cage match.

02:10:42.780 --> 02:10:44.740
[SPEAKER_18]: So it is last call for cage match votes.

02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:45.900
[SPEAKER_18]: Last call for cage match votes.

02:10:46.321 --> 02:10:53.783
[SPEAKER_18]: And we're going to go to our break, and when we come back, we'll announce the winner of the cage match, and we'll do the FUs of the week when we come back.

02:10:54.283 --> 02:10:55.463
[SPEAKER_18]: And who knows what else is on our mind?

02:10:55.683 --> 02:10:55.963
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

02:10:56.743 --> 02:10:57.984
[SPEAKER_17]: I was just going to mention.

02:10:58.184 --> 02:10:58.424
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:10:58.444 --> 02:10:58.524
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:10:59.076 --> 02:11:05.921
[SPEAKER_17]: That my copy of In the Groove is coming, and for all those people that are concerned, oh, has he changed his mind?

02:11:06.021 --> 02:11:06.181
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

02:11:06.501 --> 02:11:10.423
[SPEAKER_17]: No, this is the one that I'm writing this game sucks on, and I think we'll be giving it away.

02:11:10.844 --> 02:11:14.566
[SPEAKER_18]: Yes, so Loki will be writing this game sucks on a copy of In the Groove.

02:11:14.626 --> 02:11:19.409
[SPEAKER_18]: Now, remember, the opinions of Loki do not necessarily reflect those of Orange Launch Radio or its staff.

02:11:21.150 --> 02:11:22.151
[SPEAKER_18]: It's Loki's opinion.

02:11:22.191 --> 02:11:24.993
[SPEAKER_18]: He's going to write this game sucks on a game, but hey, free game.

02:11:25.805 --> 02:11:26.665
[SPEAKER_13]: I share the opinion.

02:11:28.186 --> 02:11:30.407
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not totally like-minded.

02:11:30.767 --> 02:11:32.288
[SPEAKER_18]: I halfway share the opinion.

02:11:32.468 --> 02:11:34.189
[SPEAKER_18]: There's half I like and half I don't like.

02:11:34.349 --> 02:11:35.389
[SPEAKER_18]: That's why I halfway share the opinion.

02:11:35.409 --> 02:11:36.630
[SPEAKER_17]: I might chew on the manual a bit.

02:11:36.670 --> 02:11:38.571
[SPEAKER_18]: I would put, this game kinda sucks.

02:11:39.171 --> 02:11:39.952
[SPEAKER_18]: How about this?

02:11:40.192 --> 02:11:42.313
[SPEAKER_18]: This game could be better, is what I would write.

02:11:42.353 --> 02:11:43.033
[SPEAKER_18]: This game could be better.

02:11:43.053 --> 02:11:44.114
[SPEAKER_15]: I want to burn part of the manual.

02:11:44.734 --> 02:11:45.374
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, anyway.

02:11:45.394 --> 02:11:45.874
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll be allowed on it.

02:11:46.355 --> 02:11:47.175
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, kids.

02:11:48.060 --> 02:11:48.961
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be giving that away.

02:11:49.021 --> 02:11:49.662
[SPEAKER_18]: So free game.

02:11:50.003 --> 02:11:51.545
[SPEAKER_18]: Whether you like it in the groove or not, free game.

02:11:51.725 --> 02:11:54.389
[SPEAKER_15]: I will personally run over the box with my car for you.

02:11:54.449 --> 02:11:54.970
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:11:55.751 --> 02:11:59.196
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to break.

02:11:59.216 --> 02:12:01.720
[SPEAKER_18]: We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

02:12:02.040 --> 02:12:03.302
[SPEAKER_18]: Start off with some colors from 2DX.

02:12:20.583 --> 02:12:21.607
Thanks for watching!

02:13:25.298 --> 02:13:25.899
Thanks for watching!

02:14:13.660 --> 02:14:14.706
Thanks for watching!

02:14:46.747 --> 02:14:47.507
Thanks for watching!

02:16:28.450 --> 02:16:29.320
Nothing to say

02:17:24.215 --> 02:17:25.336
Thank you for watching.

02:18:25.558 --> 02:18:26.504
Thank you for watching!

02:19:25.782 --> 02:19:34.369
[SPEAKER_21]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:41.015
[SPEAKER_10]: We're back, kids!

02:19:41.375 --> 02:19:42.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Did you miss us?

02:19:42.636 --> 02:19:43.437
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge Radio?

02:19:43.677 --> 02:19:44.218
[SPEAKER_18]: Here, shut up.

02:19:44.638 --> 02:19:45.158
[SPEAKER_18]: In studio.

02:19:46.720 --> 02:19:54.086
[SPEAKER_18]: In that break, colors, quickening, drifting, I didn't even realize I inadvertently put two Taka songs back to back, but whatever, deal.

02:19:54.918 --> 02:20:08.299
[SPEAKER_15]: Drifting Away and Beautiful Days by the one and only Fantastic Plastic Machine I found Fantastic Plastic Machine doing something that's on a compilation that's got gorillas on it too, I think

02:20:09.295 --> 02:20:10.136
[SPEAKER_18]: You nerd.

02:20:10.616 --> 02:20:13.198
[SPEAKER_15]: But I saw it on something else, though.

02:20:13.398 --> 02:20:18.042
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like something that Fantastic Plastic Machine's doing with... Crap.

02:20:18.342 --> 02:20:19.123
[SPEAKER_15]: It was at Target.

02:20:19.303 --> 02:20:20.244
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't Gorillaz, actually.

02:20:20.264 --> 02:20:22.346
[SPEAKER_15]: I was looking for another compilation.

02:20:22.366 --> 02:20:23.387
[SPEAKER_18]: If it's Target, I want it.

02:20:23.527 --> 02:20:24.848
[SPEAKER_15]: It wasn't Target, it was at Best Buy.

02:20:25.228 --> 02:20:26.049
[SPEAKER_18]: Target is so sexy.

02:20:26.069 --> 02:20:26.849
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, fuck Best Buy.

02:20:26.909 --> 02:20:27.370
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I'm kidding.

02:20:27.450 --> 02:20:27.750
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding.

02:20:27.810 --> 02:20:28.931
[SPEAKER_18]: I buy stuff at Best Buy.

02:20:28.971 --> 02:20:33.295
[SPEAKER_15]: I can't remember what it was, but it was another Fantastic Plastic Machine song on this random compilation.

02:20:33.315 --> 02:20:33.915
[SPEAKER_15]: I almost bought it.

02:20:34.456 --> 02:20:36.017
[SPEAKER_18]: It sounds like good music for commercials.

02:20:36.932 --> 02:20:37.193
[SPEAKER_18]: Really?

02:20:37.413 --> 02:20:42.204
[SPEAKER_15]: The whole CD, though, the beautiful CD by Fantastic Plastic Machine, is just interesting.

02:20:42.404 --> 02:20:43.687
[SPEAKER_15]: But it has Take Me to the Disco on it.

02:20:43.707 --> 02:20:44.268
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what was cool.

02:20:44.509 --> 02:20:45.752
[SPEAKER_15]: I went cage match with that once.

02:20:46.032 --> 02:20:46.293
[SPEAKER_18]: You did?

02:20:47.580 --> 02:20:49.240
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's find out who won tonight's cage match, shall we?

02:20:49.621 --> 02:20:50.761
[SPEAKER_18]: I remember that banner.

02:20:50.801 --> 02:20:52.021
[SPEAKER_18]: That's the awesomest banner.

02:20:52.041 --> 02:20:52.581
[SPEAKER_18]: I need to use that again.

02:20:52.601 --> 02:20:56.102
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going through all my old banners, and I found one I made for Rob with Bob Barker on it.

02:20:56.122 --> 02:20:57.583
[SPEAKER_18]: And it says, The Sky is Right.

02:20:57.963 --> 02:20:58.683
[SPEAKER_15]: I have that font, though.

02:20:58.703 --> 02:20:59.603
[SPEAKER_18]: You should link our chatroom to that.

02:20:59.623 --> 02:21:00.023
[SPEAKER_18]: It's great.

02:21:00.364 --> 02:21:04.625
[SPEAKER_18]: The only reason I don't use that anymore is because now I whore Orange Lounge Radio and my banners on all the websites.

02:21:04.685 --> 02:21:06.605
[SPEAKER_18]: I still have to see him before he dies.

02:21:06.805 --> 02:21:09.626
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Barker, next year before E3, since you get to go now.

02:21:10.446 --> 02:21:12.227
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't go before E3, remember?

02:21:13.227 --> 02:21:16.248
[SPEAKER_17]: And there's a lot of stipulations because I'm getting married.

02:21:16.728 --> 02:21:17.609
[SPEAKER_17]: Bitch!

02:21:19.069 --> 02:21:20.030
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm kidding, I love Nelly.

02:21:20.050 --> 02:21:21.710
[SPEAKER_18]: But what a bitch!

02:21:25.511 --> 02:21:29.593
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, I'm going to be lucky if I get to go this time.

02:21:30.293 --> 02:21:30.873
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, I know.

02:21:32.614 --> 02:21:33.794
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody's making you get married.

02:21:34.395 --> 02:21:36.195
[SPEAKER_18]: Except maybe your fiance.

02:21:36.215 --> 02:21:41.097
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't see why you can't do the cheap DMV style one like me and Dan did.

02:21:41.909 --> 02:21:44.130
[SPEAKER_17]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

02:22:11.667 --> 02:22:17.152
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight's winner was... Destination Blackout!

02:22:20.474 --> 02:22:23.397
[SPEAKER_18]: Handful of votes, though, for song number one, Blame.

02:22:23.937 --> 02:22:26.359
[SPEAKER_18]: Not so many votes for Nada Es Eterno.

02:22:26.919 --> 02:22:28.721
[SPEAKER_18]: I guess you guys just aren't feeling the love.

02:22:30.022 --> 02:22:32.524
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, so DarkSakura wins tonight's cage match.

02:22:32.624 --> 02:22:34.346
[SPEAKER_18]: She doesn't have to pick a new song last week.

02:22:34.566 --> 02:22:35.987
[SPEAKER_18]: That means I can sleep in next week.

02:22:36.187 --> 02:22:39.670
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't think I've won a cage match now in about three months.

02:22:40.669 --> 02:22:41.990
[SPEAKER_18]: So I'm getting mad.

02:22:42.070 --> 02:22:43.111
[SPEAKER_18]: You should pick better songs.

02:22:43.651 --> 02:22:44.772
[SPEAKER_18]: You can suck my dick.

02:22:44.832 --> 02:22:46.494
[SPEAKER_15]: Something is really fucked up.

02:22:47.414 --> 02:22:52.058
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, last week was supposed to be the fucked up thing, but it got a ton of votes.

02:22:52.578 --> 02:22:55.561
[SPEAKER_18]: All three songs last week were very close and very narrowly lost.

02:22:55.921 --> 02:22:58.423
[SPEAKER_18]: So now I'm just going to have to get really, really fucked up.

02:22:58.483 --> 02:23:01.305
[SPEAKER_18]: I have another song that is just god-awful bad.

02:23:02.106 --> 02:23:08.511
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the worst thing I've found on the iTunes Music Store, and I'm going to play it next week, I think, out of spite for our listeners.

02:23:09.668 --> 02:23:11.230
[SPEAKER_18]: But at least my song got a couple votes.

02:23:11.290 --> 02:23:11.931
[SPEAKER_18]: That makes me happy.

02:23:11.951 --> 02:23:13.793
[SPEAKER_18]: At least it got a couple votes, so I'm not as mad.

02:23:15.435 --> 02:23:15.875
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:23:17.397 --> 02:23:20.221
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, we've been teasing this a little bit throughout tonight's show.

02:23:20.301 --> 02:23:23.284
[SPEAKER_18]: You have gotten yourself into a brand new MMO.

02:23:23.544 --> 02:23:23.945
[SPEAKER_18]: What is it?

02:23:24.759 --> 02:23:26.040
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm playing World of Warcraft.

02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:27.621
[SPEAKER_18]: World of Warcraft!

02:23:27.641 --> 02:23:29.061
[SPEAKER_15]: About time one of us did.

02:23:29.201 --> 02:23:34.244
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, World of Warcraft is a huge game and nobody's really, none of the three of us have really gotten into it yet.

02:23:34.264 --> 02:23:35.144
[SPEAKER_15]: It's so pretty.

02:23:35.364 --> 02:23:36.385
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I heard it's a pretty game.

02:23:36.745 --> 02:23:38.646
[SPEAKER_18]: What made you decide you want to start playing World of Warcraft?

02:23:38.686 --> 02:23:40.007
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I know a bunch of people who play it.

02:23:40.267 --> 02:23:40.447
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah?

02:23:40.947 --> 02:23:42.188
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's not Final Fantasy XI.

02:23:42.688 --> 02:23:44.149
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey now, watch it, watch it.

02:23:44.469 --> 02:23:50.552
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm sorry, I gave Final Fantasy XI a humongous try and I hated being forced to.

02:23:51.118 --> 02:23:56.981
[SPEAKER_15]: into hanging out with a bunch of people that I didn't know and healing their stupid, ungrateful asses.

02:23:57.021 --> 02:24:00.903
[SPEAKER_18]: That's people's major bitch about Final Fantasy XI is the forced partying.

02:24:00.923 --> 02:24:02.783
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have to do that in World of Warcraft.

02:24:02.843 --> 02:24:04.744
[SPEAKER_15]: If I played a hunter, I could have a pet crocodile.

02:24:07.085 --> 02:24:07.666
[SPEAKER_18]: Crogies!

02:24:07.706 --> 02:24:10.287
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a pet crocodile!

02:24:10.987 --> 02:24:12.948
[SPEAKER_18]: Who was that guy, the crocodile hunter, that had his movie?

02:24:12.988 --> 02:24:13.228
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:24:14.549 --> 02:24:14.929
[SPEAKER_18]: Erwin!

02:24:16.210 --> 02:24:16.990
[SPEAKER_18]: That guy was hilarious.

02:24:18.585 --> 02:24:22.847
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm playing a night elf druid because I want to turn into a kitty.

02:24:24.908 --> 02:24:25.648
[SPEAKER_15]: That's really it.

02:24:25.668 --> 02:24:27.589
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, ooh, I can turn into a cat.

02:24:27.689 --> 02:24:31.671
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I think it's time.

02:24:31.831 --> 02:24:33.051
[SPEAKER_18]: That's cool.

02:24:33.171 --> 02:24:37.613
[SPEAKER_18]: And Magus, who's been playing World of Warcraft for a while, is over there going, don't do that, it sucks.

02:24:37.953 --> 02:24:38.453
[SPEAKER_18]: It sucks.

02:24:39.034 --> 02:24:40.514
[SPEAKER_15]: Seriously, cat form sucks.

02:24:41.695 --> 02:24:42.055
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright.

02:24:42.235 --> 02:24:47.437
[SPEAKER_15]: But it looked like druids have a lot of neat stuff that they can do later on, so I'm looking forward to it.

02:24:48.012 --> 02:24:48.812
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, very cool.

02:24:51.093 --> 02:24:51.393
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

02:24:52.714 --> 02:24:54.354
[SPEAKER_17]: I will not be playing World of Warcraft.

02:24:55.075 --> 02:25:02.297
[SPEAKER_17]: And as of right now, it's like I'm not really going to be playing Final Fantasy XI either, because I just can't seem to find time to get on there.

02:25:04.218 --> 02:25:04.598
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know.

02:25:05.498 --> 02:25:10.000
[SPEAKER_17]: I get distracted by all these things, like, you know, movies... Real life?

02:25:10.880 --> 02:25:12.301
[SPEAKER_17]: Pussy, yes, exactly.

02:25:13.581 --> 02:25:15.542
[SPEAKER_17]: Burnout Revenge, um...

02:25:16.656 --> 02:25:19.878
[SPEAKER_17]: and I still have to play Magic Penjel, or not Magic Penjel, Graffiti Kingdom.

02:25:20.318 --> 02:25:22.419
[SPEAKER_17]: I bought that game like a while ago and I had to play it.

02:25:22.439 --> 02:25:24.460
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, I have your Magic Penjel game.

02:25:25.361 --> 02:25:29.142
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry, I have my version of the hard drive.

02:25:29.162 --> 02:25:31.043
[SPEAKER_18]: I gotcha, I gotcha, I gotcha.

02:25:31.063 --> 02:25:34.905
[SPEAKER_17]: Speaking of which, I still have your DDR Max 2, I think.

02:25:34.965 --> 02:25:36.886
[SPEAKER_17]: I want that back.

02:25:36.927 --> 02:25:41.649
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't know how we ended up with two US copies of it, I mean, because, but whatever.

02:25:41.977 --> 02:25:43.558
[SPEAKER_18]: I've been playing Pump It Up lately.

02:25:43.838 --> 02:25:47.521
[SPEAKER_18]: If you listened to last week's show, I'm kind of liking Pump It Up, believe it or not, on Xbox.

02:25:47.561 --> 02:25:48.281
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's really good.

02:25:48.561 --> 02:25:49.282
[SPEAKER_18]: Like, I know, I know.

02:25:49.402 --> 02:25:54.205
[SPEAKER_18]: Even if I were listening to myself like three weeks ago, I would have said, Rob, you're smoking dope.

02:25:54.605 --> 02:25:57.647
[SPEAKER_18]: But no, it's really a fun dance game on the home version.

02:25:57.767 --> 02:25:58.168
[SPEAKER_18]: I know!

02:25:58.728 --> 02:25:59.529
[SPEAKER_18]: Stop looking at me like that!

02:26:00.049 --> 02:26:00.249
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:26:01.190 --> 02:26:01.470
[SPEAKER_18]: I know.

02:26:02.130 --> 02:26:03.511
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what else no one's playing?

02:26:04.031 --> 02:26:04.452
[SPEAKER_17]: In the group.

02:26:05.837 --> 02:26:06.297
[SPEAKER_18]: Shut up.

02:26:07.098 --> 02:26:07.699
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:26:07.719 --> 02:26:12.925
[SPEAKER_15]: Honestly, though, I did see In the Groove at Best Buy, and it had dust on it.

02:26:15.007 --> 02:26:16.328
[SPEAKER_18]: You guys are awful.

02:26:16.448 --> 02:26:17.510
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to go pour dust on them.

02:26:17.550 --> 02:26:18.711
[SPEAKER_13]: I know, I'm being very serious.

02:26:19.171 --> 02:26:19.312
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

02:26:19.372 --> 02:26:21.434
[SPEAKER_17]: You guys are just ruthless.

02:26:21.494 --> 02:26:25.919
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't care about In the Groove, because I'm over it.

02:26:26.459 --> 02:26:26.880
[SPEAKER_17]: It's done.

02:26:28.502 --> 02:26:28.862
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:26:28.882 --> 02:26:32.226
[SPEAKER_18]: I heard they cut the price of it, though.

02:26:32.666 --> 02:26:34.128
[SPEAKER_18]: Or is that just on DDR Freak?

02:26:34.308 --> 02:26:35.650
[SPEAKER_17]: It's a sale that's going on.

02:26:35.690 --> 02:26:36.350
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not DDR Freak.

02:26:36.370 --> 02:26:37.151
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just Red Octane.

02:26:37.171 --> 02:26:39.153
[SPEAKER_17]: They clear out their extra copies they aren't selling.

02:26:39.273 --> 02:26:41.155
[SPEAKER_17]: And, you know, I bought one.

02:26:41.676 --> 02:26:42.497
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm only helping.

02:26:44.938 --> 02:26:45.598
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, isn't it?

02:26:46.259 --> 02:26:54.444
[SPEAKER_18]: If you think about it, even though Loki is saying how much he hates this game and stuff, he just helped them out by buying a copy legitimately just to give away to somebody.

02:26:54.484 --> 02:26:59.447
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can't hate him too much in the group of fans because he ended up supporting your game after all.

02:26:59.727 --> 02:27:01.628
[SPEAKER_18]: So taunt him relentlessly over that.

02:27:02.048 --> 02:27:02.568
[SPEAKER_18]: Doesn't matter.

02:27:03.329 --> 02:27:03.669
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:27:04.437 --> 02:27:10.081
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright kids, it's that time of the show where we're going to get a little bit angsty and it's time to get into the FUs of the week.

02:27:10.101 --> 02:27:12.223
[SPEAKER_18]: So if you have some FUs of the week, send those on over to me.

02:27:12.623 --> 02:27:16.346
[SPEAKER_18]: And DarkSakura, why do we have to do these FUs of the week every single week?

02:27:16.566 --> 02:27:17.527
[SPEAKER_11]: Grr, argh.

02:27:23.992 --> 02:27:32.959
[SPEAKER_15]: The big FU goes toward the flu or whatever the fuck it was I had because I was miserable and now I'm still getting weird fatigue from it too.

02:27:33.863 --> 02:27:45.507
[SPEAKER_15]: So, an FU goes to having a geography exam on Wednesday, but on the same day I have to get my ass up at like 4.30 in the morning to get Dan to the airport at 6.

02:27:45.567 --> 02:27:51.489
[SPEAKER_15]: So he can fly off to a big ol' happy GameStop video game manager conference and get free shit.

02:27:51.809 --> 02:27:54.650
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I have to go to work that morning, dammit.

02:27:55.351 --> 02:27:59.252
[SPEAKER_15]: And have to deal with a 30 minute lunch and then an exam afterwards that I really don't want to go to.

02:27:59.332 --> 02:28:00.572
[SPEAKER_15]: Thank you very much.

02:28:01.533 --> 02:28:01.613
[SPEAKER_15]: Um...

02:28:04.037 --> 02:28:20.783
[SPEAKER_15]: and an FU goes to being told I was going to be prescribed antibiotics for the sinus infection part of what I had and then going all the way to the pharmacy to find out, oh no, I'm sorry, they didn't prescribe that and then telling them to refill my decongestant and having them not do it, just refill my ibuprofen instead.

02:28:21.823 --> 02:28:22.263
[SPEAKER_15]: Buttheads.

02:28:24.964 --> 02:28:33.287
[SPEAKER_15]: And another FU goes toward people who like to just try to kill me while I'm driving, you know, I think that they're retards.

02:28:35.123 --> 02:28:36.904
[SPEAKER_15]: FU to InTheGroove because it bites.

02:28:38.205 --> 02:28:38.565
[SPEAKER_15]: What?

02:28:41.728 --> 02:28:50.354
[SPEAKER_15]: And FU to, for some reason, World of Warcraft is not letting me use my controller and I haven't seen anything on how to set up a controller config on it.

02:28:51.315 --> 02:28:55.077
[SPEAKER_15]: That is the biggest piece of shit I have ever heard in my entire life.

02:29:01.422 --> 02:29:02.963
[SPEAKER_15]: Actually, I do the point-click mouse thingy.

02:29:03.738 --> 02:29:05.239
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, which is like playing Ragnarok.

02:29:06.320 --> 02:29:11.262
[SPEAKER_15]: But, uh... Okay, I'm gonna be sending some hate mail to Blizzard.

02:29:12.243 --> 02:29:12.943
[SPEAKER_15]: So, that's it.

02:29:13.984 --> 02:29:16.445
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, let's get to Loki and his FUs of the week.

02:29:17.786 --> 02:29:22.569
[SPEAKER_17]: Blizzard does, though, have the chicken quest where you can get a pet chicken to follow you around, which is kind of fun.

02:29:22.689 --> 02:29:23.570
[SPEAKER_17]: Type slash chicken.

02:29:24.150 --> 02:29:27.492
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyways, um... Yeah.

02:29:27.932 --> 02:29:29.393
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, an FU to that guy on Dig.

02:29:33.311 --> 02:29:35.253
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, Monkey Balls, or what was his name?

02:29:35.813 --> 02:29:37.034
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, Monkey Balls!

02:29:37.074 --> 02:29:37.615
[SPEAKER_18]: Monkey Butter?

02:29:37.635 --> 02:29:37.995
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't remember.

02:29:38.015 --> 02:29:39.276
[SPEAKER_13]: Monkey Butt Butler.

02:29:39.716 --> 02:29:41.077
[SPEAKER_17]: Monkey Butler, okay, whatever.

02:29:41.137 --> 02:29:42.138
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, anyways.

02:29:43.239 --> 02:29:45.941
[SPEAKER_17]: The only Monkey Butler I can think of is Brett Butler.

02:29:46.382 --> 02:29:53.988
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um, no, um, so first off, fuck you to stupid old people that can't drive the speed limit.

02:29:54.488 --> 02:29:57.891
[SPEAKER_17]: You know the type, the ones that are pulling out of the church parking lot on Sundays?

02:29:58.652 --> 02:29:59.032
[SPEAKER_17]: Fucking...

02:29:59.571 --> 02:30:03.292
[SPEAKER_17]: They have the glory of God holding the breakdown on the goddamn car.

02:30:03.853 --> 02:30:05.633
[SPEAKER_17]: So, fuck you to them.

02:30:05.894 --> 02:30:07.574
[SPEAKER_17]: They should burn in hell.

02:30:08.214 --> 02:30:12.236
[SPEAKER_17]: Also, I want to say fuck you to the Kia Rio dealership.

02:30:12.876 --> 02:30:17.958
[SPEAKER_17]: Or basically, yeah, Folsom Lake Kia over here in Folsom, California.

02:30:18.018 --> 02:30:21.600
[SPEAKER_17]: Because they did not have goddamn pretzels in their snack machine.

02:30:21.640 --> 02:30:26.262
[SPEAKER_17]: So I had to settle for some cheddar sour cream ruffles.

02:30:26.562 --> 02:30:26.682
[SPEAKER_17]: And...

02:30:27.302 --> 02:30:29.603
[SPEAKER_17]: The fucking machine didn't give me any change back.

02:30:29.963 --> 02:30:31.524
[SPEAKER_17]: Just like a normal car salesman.

02:30:32.544 --> 02:30:33.225
[SPEAKER_17]: So fuck them.

02:30:34.385 --> 02:30:36.806
[SPEAKER_17]: And, um, let's see what else.

02:30:36.946 --> 02:30:43.129
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, also, um, fuck you the fact that I don't have enough time to play all these games that I'm getting for free.

02:30:43.809 --> 02:30:44.750
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, you poor thing.

02:30:46.331 --> 02:30:46.771
[SPEAKER_17]: Poor me.

02:30:46.951 --> 02:30:47.511
[SPEAKER_18]: Give it to me!

02:30:47.831 --> 02:30:48.792
[SPEAKER_18]: I did nothing this week!

02:30:48.892 --> 02:30:49.252
[SPEAKER_17]: Nothing!

02:30:50.492 --> 02:30:52.393
[SPEAKER_18]: You played fucking Final Fantasy XI.

02:30:53.154 --> 02:30:53.994
[SPEAKER_18]: I fucking wouldn't have.

02:30:54.014 --> 02:30:55.955
[SPEAKER_18]: I had something else to play.

02:30:57.481 --> 02:30:58.122
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:30:58.542 --> 02:30:59.803
[SPEAKER_18]: Miklatov guilted me into it.

02:30:59.863 --> 02:31:00.463
[SPEAKER_18]: What can I say?

02:31:01.944 --> 02:31:03.065
[SPEAKER_17]: So, yeah.

02:31:03.185 --> 02:31:04.186
[SPEAKER_17]: There was something else here.

02:31:06.088 --> 02:31:06.348
[SPEAKER_17]: Whatever.

02:31:06.368 --> 02:31:07.328
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't remember it.

02:31:07.749 --> 02:31:10.171
[SPEAKER_17]: Just, you know, mainly fuck you old people for driving slow.

02:31:12.212 --> 02:31:14.814
[SPEAKER_17]: And those people that don't signal, fuck them too.

02:31:15.274 --> 02:31:19.598
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate those people that need to weave through traffic to get, like, five seconds ahead of everybody else.

02:31:20.178 --> 02:31:25.162
[SPEAKER_15]: And fuck the people who actually try to change lanes into the spot that you exactly are existing in right now.

02:31:26.397 --> 02:31:29.399
[SPEAKER_17]: or the ones that pretend that your car's not there and don't let you in when you're signaling.

02:31:30.480 --> 02:31:31.881
[SPEAKER_15]: Those are usually the people that I cut off.

02:31:32.081 --> 02:31:33.042
[SPEAKER_17]: That's usually me, actually.

02:31:34.783 --> 02:31:35.684
[SPEAKER_17]: Alright, I'm done.

02:31:42.809 --> 02:31:44.610
[SPEAKER_18]: An F you to my washer because...

02:31:45.217 --> 02:32:13.739
[SPEAKER_18]: it constantly gets my clothes off balance like every time I do a load of laundry in there it starts spinning and it sounds like the psycho washer from hell because it's going vroom vroom vroom vroom vroom and we live upstairs mind you so I know those people that live downstairs are not happy with us there's nothing you can do and an F you to myself for forgetting that I need to go to the washer and take my clothes and put them in the dryer because they've been sitting in the washer for about oh three hours now so way to go Rob smart smart thing and now nice and mildewy fresh will my clothes be

02:32:15.985 --> 02:32:18.087
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it, I'm short on FUs tonight, that's it.

02:32:18.627 --> 02:32:23.151
[SPEAKER_18]: So let's get to our guests tonight, starting off with Bugged and his FUs of the week.

02:32:23.611 --> 02:32:24.592
[SPEAKER_23]: FU to Hooters, actually.

02:32:25.152 --> 02:32:28.195
[SPEAKER_23]: Not for the boobs and cleavage, but for using MSG on their wings.

02:32:28.275 --> 02:32:28.915
[SPEAKER_23]: Gave me a migraine.

02:32:29.235 --> 02:32:30.516
[SPEAKER_23]: They use MSG on their wings?

02:32:30.817 --> 02:32:35.060
[SPEAKER_23]: Yeah, well, between my brother and his two friends and I, we went through 50 wings.

02:32:35.741 --> 02:32:36.721
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh my god!

02:32:38.002 --> 02:32:41.245
[SPEAKER_23]: But my brother's my size, and so are his friends.

02:32:43.359 --> 02:32:45.080
[SPEAKER_23]: So yeah, that was the beginning of my week.

02:32:45.140 --> 02:32:48.563
[SPEAKER_23]: Monday was go to Hooters, have wings, have migraine for the next two days.

02:32:48.763 --> 02:32:50.585
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to the line at Hooters being way too long.

02:32:51.065 --> 02:32:51.566
[SPEAKER_23]: Walked right in.

02:32:52.426 --> 02:32:52.706
[SPEAKER_18]: When?

02:32:52.967 --> 02:32:53.227
[SPEAKER_23]: Monday.

02:32:53.847 --> 02:32:54.308
[SPEAKER_18]: Monday night?

02:32:54.508 --> 02:32:55.909
[SPEAKER_23]: No, Monday afternoon.

02:32:56.129 --> 02:32:56.269
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh.

02:32:56.429 --> 02:32:56.890
[SPEAKER_23]: Three, four.

02:32:57.050 --> 02:32:57.610
[SPEAKER_18]: See, that's why.

02:32:58.111 --> 02:32:58.831
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to try going to Hooters.

02:32:58.851 --> 02:32:59.592
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to working, huh?

02:33:00.092 --> 02:33:00.493
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah.

02:33:00.533 --> 02:33:01.774
[SPEAKER_11]: Hooters is kind of icky anyway.

02:33:02.134 --> 02:33:05.517
[SPEAKER_18]: Hooters is a little bit overrated, but there's something... I can't explain that.

02:33:05.617 --> 02:33:08.819
[SPEAKER_18]: I know what some of you guys that have been listening to this show for a while are thinking.

02:33:08.879 --> 02:33:09.740
[SPEAKER_18]: Rob, you're gay.

02:33:09.780 --> 02:33:10.881
[SPEAKER_18]: What's the deal with Hooters?

02:33:12.459 --> 02:33:13.159
[SPEAKER_18]: I can't explain it.

02:33:13.179 --> 02:33:14.579
[SPEAKER_18]: It's the same reason I go to strip clubs.

02:33:14.639 --> 02:33:15.580
[SPEAKER_18]: Boobies are hilarious.

02:33:16.680 --> 02:33:19.580
[SPEAKER_18]: We fought through a crowd to get to Hooters.

02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:20.400
[SPEAKER_18]: We did.

02:33:20.520 --> 02:33:21.161
[SPEAKER_18]: A concert.

02:33:21.361 --> 02:33:21.721
[SPEAKER_18]: We did.

02:33:21.761 --> 02:33:30.042
[SPEAKER_18]: When we were at E3 in LA, randomly that Thursday or Friday night, I think it was the Thursday night of E3, we were on Hollywood Boulevard, our hotel, right?

02:33:30.182 --> 02:33:34.483
[SPEAKER_18]: Audio Slave was having a free concert in the middle of the fucking street.

02:33:34.783 --> 02:33:39.864
[SPEAKER_18]: We had to cut through a crowd to get to Hooters, which was empty, of course, because of the...

02:33:44.025 --> 02:33:51.231
[SPEAKER_17]: My whole thing about Hooters is the same thing about fucking Krispy Kreme.

02:33:51.872 --> 02:33:53.113
[SPEAKER_15]: I grew up with this stuff.

02:33:53.954 --> 02:33:55.155
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not special.

02:33:56.876 --> 02:33:57.717
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's new.

02:33:58.530 --> 02:34:00.751
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not special and it's not new.

02:34:00.771 --> 02:34:09.713
[SPEAKER_18]: To those of you guys in the rest of America, understand, Sacramento is, and I seriously think I read this somewhere, Sacramento is the only major city in the nation that has not had a Hooters until this year.

02:34:10.433 --> 02:34:12.973
[SPEAKER_15]: The real reason to rejoice is if we get Waffle House.

02:34:13.834 --> 02:34:15.594
[SPEAKER_18]: I would also like, or Shoney's.

02:34:16.454 --> 02:34:18.495
[SPEAKER_15]: Shoney's, Waffle House.

02:34:18.535 --> 02:34:19.075
[SPEAKER_18]: Bob Evans.

02:34:19.502 --> 02:34:24.284
[SPEAKER_15]: We need Shoney's, Waffle House, and... But you East Coast Cracker Barrel.

02:34:24.724 --> 02:34:27.185
[SPEAKER_18]: Cracker Barrel by... Oh, please, please.

02:34:27.705 --> 02:34:29.506
[SPEAKER_18]: Cracker Barrel's a little bit overrated to me.

02:34:29.526 --> 02:34:34.428
[SPEAKER_15]: There's three places that I just named off for not within driving distance unless I feel like taking three days to get there.

02:34:34.848 --> 02:34:35.248
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know.

02:34:35.548 --> 02:34:37.049
[SPEAKER_23]: Cracker Barrel's in Salt Lake City.

02:34:37.089 --> 02:34:37.769
[SPEAKER_23]: That's only 12 hours.

02:34:37.789 --> 02:34:44.372
[SPEAKER_18]: But you East Coast people... You East Coast people can keep your Hardee's because Carl's Jr.

02:34:44.412 --> 02:34:45.192
[SPEAKER_18]: is way better than Hardee's.

02:34:45.560 --> 02:34:47.260
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the same fucking restaurant.

02:34:47.280 --> 02:34:48.041
[SPEAKER_18]: No, it's way better here.

02:34:48.161 --> 02:34:49.361
[SPEAKER_15]: They're owned by the same people.

02:34:49.381 --> 02:34:50.741
[SPEAKER_18]: And you don't have Jack in the Box, so neither do you.

02:34:50.761 --> 02:34:52.642
[SPEAKER_15]: But you can't get fried chicken or biscuits and gravy.

02:34:52.842 --> 02:34:53.942
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, alright.

02:34:53.982 --> 02:34:56.703
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's let Bug finish.

02:34:56.723 --> 02:34:59.143
[SPEAKER_23]: An F you to Apple for the iPod Nano.

02:34:59.803 --> 02:35:13.847
[SPEAKER_23]: It's so damn sexy and looks so nice and it's really damn small and it doesn't support my most useful item I have for my 20 gig, which is the wireless remote where I don't have to actually look at the machine or the iPod.

02:35:13.867 --> 02:35:15.327
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright.

02:35:15.691 --> 02:35:16.191
[SPEAKER_23]: It's kind of crummy.

02:35:16.751 --> 02:35:17.231
[SPEAKER_23]: It looks nice.

02:35:18.372 --> 02:35:19.672
[SPEAKER_23]: And the headphone port's on the bottom.

02:35:19.692 --> 02:35:20.552
[SPEAKER_23]: It's really strange looking.

02:35:22.773 --> 02:35:23.613
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, Magus.

02:35:25.093 --> 02:35:27.554
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, you know I've had these saved up for a long time.

02:35:28.114 --> 02:35:29.794
[SPEAKER_20]: Make it quick, it's a three hour show.

02:35:30.675 --> 02:35:31.915
[SPEAKER_20]: Three hours, who'd guess?

02:35:32.515 --> 02:35:34.535
[SPEAKER_15]: No pulling in explicit, thank you.

02:35:35.096 --> 02:35:36.296
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, alright, alright.

02:35:36.876 --> 02:35:39.237
[SPEAKER_20]: First off, fuck you to the state of Massachusetts.

02:35:39.437 --> 02:35:41.217
[SPEAKER_20]: Yes, the entire fucking state.

02:35:41.677 --> 02:35:45.238
[SPEAKER_20]: Especially the pharmacies and the hospitals and the doctor's offices.

02:35:45.888 --> 02:35:50.290
[SPEAKER_20]: We give you a number to call if you have problems looking up eligibility.

02:35:50.991 --> 02:35:52.392
[SPEAKER_20]: We give you a number to call.

02:35:53.172 --> 02:35:55.273
[SPEAKER_20]: Don't give it to the goddamn patients.

02:35:55.933 --> 02:35:56.514
[SPEAKER_20]: They call.

02:35:56.834 --> 02:35:57.895
[SPEAKER_20]: We can't help you.

02:35:58.235 --> 02:35:58.955
[SPEAKER_20]: Move along.

02:35:59.395 --> 02:36:02.197
[SPEAKER_20]: Call the number you're supposed to call.

02:36:02.677 --> 02:36:05.058
[SPEAKER_20]: Do not give them our number.

02:36:05.399 --> 02:36:06.759
[SPEAKER_20]: We don't help with that shit.

02:36:08.060 --> 02:36:10.481
[SPEAKER_18]: Nobody on the internet knows what you're talking about right now, but that's okay.

02:36:10.721 --> 02:36:12.602
[SPEAKER_20]: That's what this is all about.

02:36:12.943 --> 02:36:13.543
[SPEAKER_20]: Second of all,

02:36:14.110 --> 02:36:32.102
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to these PVP server rejects that think they're gonna roll on the new World of Warcraft PVP roleplay servers, which are basically roleplay naming policies and in-character stuff with player versus player contested area rules.

02:36:33.402 --> 02:36:39.806
[SPEAKER_20]: Now, you have these people harassing roleplayers left and right and then saying, we're exploiting the rules against them.

02:36:40.447 --> 02:36:43.609
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, if you didn't break the rules, you wouldn't get busted for them.

02:36:44.218 --> 02:36:45.499
[SPEAKER_20]: Likewise to forums.

02:36:46.019 --> 02:36:48.240
[SPEAKER_20]: You don't break the rules, you don't ban forums.

02:36:49.480 --> 02:36:51.041
[SPEAKER_18]: Are you a mod on GameFAQs yet?

02:36:52.181 --> 02:36:53.602
[SPEAKER_20]: No, I got passed off.

02:36:53.662 --> 02:36:58.624
[SPEAKER_20]: I had something about logging in from work they didn't like.

02:36:59.344 --> 02:36:59.764
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, whatever.

02:36:59.904 --> 02:37:00.645
[SPEAKER_20]: User map issues.

02:37:00.665 --> 02:37:02.405
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm going to try again next time, though.

02:37:03.906 --> 02:37:04.906
[SPEAKER_20]: Still big on GameFAQs.

02:37:05.246 --> 02:37:05.907
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay.

02:37:06.367 --> 02:37:06.887
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's see.

02:37:07.868 --> 02:37:13.970
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, fuck you to the PvP noobs who think roleplay is lame and gay and all that kind of shit and like

02:37:14.841 --> 02:37:17.361
[SPEAKER_20]: Hello, you're just going to get banned for, what, three days?

02:37:18.202 --> 02:37:19.042
[SPEAKER_20]: Give it a fucking rest.

02:37:19.922 --> 02:37:20.102
[SPEAKER_20]: Out.

02:37:22.142 --> 02:37:22.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel?

02:37:22.522 --> 02:37:23.023
[SPEAKER_18]: No FUs?

02:37:23.563 --> 02:37:23.763
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel?

02:37:23.823 --> 02:37:25.163
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to give an Angel on behalf.

02:37:25.183 --> 02:37:25.743
[SPEAKER_18]: He's not AC enough.

02:37:25.763 --> 02:37:27.423
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to give an FU on behalf of Angel.

02:37:27.944 --> 02:37:33.405
[SPEAKER_18]: FU to all that walking around Angel did at the convention because she's sore and you can tell she's tired as hell.

[SPEAKER_23]: Okay, okay, that was a personal FU.

02:37:42.892 --> 02:37:45.314
[SPEAKER_23]: Alright, let's get to the chatroom FUs.

02:37:45.675 --> 02:37:46.776
[SPEAKER_23]: Oh, I gotta tag one on.

[SPEAKER_23]: Agreed.

02:37:52.708 --> 02:37:54.709
[SPEAKER_18]: We just had a net split in our chatroom by the way.

02:37:56.130 --> 02:37:58.152
[SPEAKER_18]: You have the Helen Keller of DS's.

02:37:58.432 --> 02:37:59.453
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, here we go.

02:38:00.413 --> 02:38:06.798
[SPEAKER_18]: Misty says, F you to me fucking up my knee and not having a clue as to how the hell I did it and having to kind of limp around during work.

02:38:12.502 --> 02:38:18.466
[SPEAKER_18]: I would give you one for the parade itself but I got a minimum of an hour of being stuck in drive-thru without actually having to take drive-thru orders.

02:38:20.103 --> 02:38:26.845
[SPEAKER_18]: Zaku says, F you to State University Police for thinking I, a Hispanic, took their barricade to my place when my roommate actually took it.

02:38:27.746 --> 02:38:32.467
[SPEAKER_18]: That's like one time I got busted in college for smoking pot, and it was my roommate, and the bastard left.

02:38:33.147 --> 02:38:39.009
[SPEAKER_18]: He left, and like, not even five seconds later, I walk in, and I smell pot, and then my door's open, and my RA walks by, and he smells pot.

02:38:39.029 --> 02:38:40.130
[SPEAKER_18]: He's like, Rob, you didn't smoke a pot?

02:38:40.490 --> 02:38:42.691
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm like, do I look like... Oh, so mad.

[SPEAKER_18]: When my roommate was so obviously a pothead.

02:38:45.492 --> 02:38:46.672
[SPEAKER_18]: He was such a pothead!

02:38:50.115 --> 02:38:50.775
[SPEAKER_18]: That's how he laughed.

02:38:51.055 --> 02:38:53.676
[SPEAKER_18]: He had that total storm laugh.

02:38:54.696 --> 02:38:57.317
[SPEAKER_15]: We just had the bottles of booze hidden in my closet.

02:38:57.457 --> 02:38:57.697
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway.

02:38:58.017 --> 02:39:02.158
[SPEAKER_18]: Zaku also says, F you to Tokyo Game Action for going to great lengths to get Happy Sky.

02:39:02.438 --> 02:39:05.559

[SPEAKER_18]: I'll say it, Loki.

02:39:13.181 --> 02:39:13.541
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki!

02:39:27.925 --> 02:39:29.826
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh my god, that's disgusting!

02:39:30.307 --> 02:39:31.627
[SPEAKER_18]: What kind of kinky shit are they, aren't they?

02:39:31.848 --> 02:39:32.808
[SPEAKER_18]: I know, gross.

02:39:33.009 --> 02:39:35.150
[SPEAKER_23]: I got puked on in a casino once that way.

02:39:36.751 --> 02:39:40.794
[SPEAKER_23]: Random person walking by just started puking on everything, including the people nearby.

02:39:40.814 --> 02:39:41.175

[SPEAKER_18]: DarkTetsuya says FU to G4 for ruining the concept of MMO Oregon Trail and a final FU to AOL.

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:56.806
[SPEAKER_18]: Can't say I miss it.

02:39:57.486 --> 02:39:57.726
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:39:57.866 --> 02:40:00.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Did they do an MMO Oregon Trail thing on G4?

02:40:00.768 --> 02:40:01.028
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:40:01.468 --> 02:40:02.348
[SPEAKER_18]: That was our joke.

02:40:02.808 --> 02:40:03.709
[SPEAKER_18]: That was our joke.

02:40:04.049 --> 02:40:04.329
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

02:40:04.409 --> 02:40:04.629
[SPEAKER_18]: What?

02:40:05.734 --> 02:40:06.214
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Knight

02:40:27.799 --> 02:40:29.960
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Knight, did I just say Dark and Knight?

02:40:29.980 --> 02:40:34.002
[SPEAKER_18]: Because I was reading in the chatroom somebody had just written Papini Roja, and I said Dark and Knight.

02:40:34.842 --> 02:40:41.565
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Knight says, F you to six fucking days of work coming to me, and F you having a free laptop and no power cord to plug it into.

02:41:06.026 --> 02:41:10.248
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to the noobs that dissed the Revolution Controller without reading the articles and watching the videos.

02:41:10.909 --> 02:41:13.971
[SPEAKER_18]: F you to all the noobs on the NGG board on GameFAQs.

02:41:14.311 --> 02:41:14.771
Bingo!

02:41:16.192 --> 02:41:17.673
[SPEAKER_18]: I got a big bingo from, uh...

[SPEAKER_18]: Megas, Goggle, not Google, but Goggle, says F you to people who call me Google.

02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:26.961
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm not a search engine.

[SPEAKER_18]: I say Goggle.

02:41:31.586 --> 02:41:33.568
[SPEAKER_18]: AZ Modius, I hope I said that right.

02:41:34.483 --> 02:41:35.003
[SPEAKER_18]: Asmodeus?

02:41:35.103 --> 02:41:35.543
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, I'm sorry.

02:41:35.823 --> 02:41:36.463
[SPEAKER_18]: Is that a character?

02:41:36.503 --> 02:41:37.924
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the name of a demon, actually.

02:41:37.984 --> 02:41:38.444
[SPEAKER_18]: Asmodeus.

02:41:38.504 --> 02:41:40.244
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, well, hell, somebody knows they're demons.

02:41:40.664 --> 02:41:49.526
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, F you to Ikaruga for being too fucking hard, having that huge-ass fish on the third stage, and that guy who beat it on hard without dying.

02:41:51.967 --> 02:41:56.968
[SPEAKER_18]: DS191 says F you to the local mall in my area for replacing DDR with In The Groove.

[SPEAKER_18]: that have a dance beat label at Techno.

02:42:06.799 --> 02:42:10.402
[SPEAKER_18]: Go back to listen to your stupid punk pop rock and mediocre hip hop bullshit.

02:42:12.503 --> 02:42:14.405
[SPEAKER_17]: I have... I have... Hold on.

02:42:15.185 --> 02:42:15.406
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

02:42:15.666 --> 02:42:18.128
[SPEAKER_18]: I have the update on the Oregon Trail thing.

02:42:18.188 --> 02:42:19.249
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, wait.

02:42:19.349 --> 02:42:19.709
[SPEAKER_18]: After this.

02:42:20.570 --> 02:42:29.437
[SPEAKER_18]: Rini says, F you to bad posture because my entire lower arm is hurting and one for my iPod because OLR interrupts my good streaks of songs when the thing's on shuffle songs.

02:42:32.099 --> 02:42:33.660
[SPEAKER_18]: Sorry to ruin your day.

02:42:34.426 --> 02:42:39.028
[SPEAKER_18]: Zaku says, F you to the Nintendo Revolution Controller for being a fake-ass anti-fighter game phaser.

02:42:39.088 --> 02:42:42.630
[SPEAKER_18]: Nintendo should set their revolution phaser on stun and sodomize themselves with it.

02:42:45.131 --> 02:42:45.931
[SPEAKER_18]: Only on the internet.

02:42:46.832 --> 02:42:49.833
[SPEAKER_18]: SSJ100Matt says, F you to the Yankees not in the playoffs.

02:42:50.253 --> 02:42:51.254
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, let's go Yankees.

02:42:53.675 --> 02:42:55.076
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, that's it, that's it.

02:42:55.596 --> 02:42:57.597
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, what's the fa- I wanna know, what the hell?

02:42:57.737 --> 02:42:57.937
[SPEAKER_18]: Did G-

02:42:58.430 --> 02:43:00.010
[SPEAKER_18]: to G4 Yanker Idea.

02:43:00.250 --> 02:43:00.791
[SPEAKER_18]: What the fuck?

02:43:00.811 --> 02:43:02.111
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's kind of retarded.

02:43:02.311 --> 02:43:02.851
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, okay.

02:43:03.211 --> 02:43:09.533
[SPEAKER_17]: What it is is the show hosts, they're playing, it's almost like, you know, like playing an actual role-playing game.

02:43:09.973 --> 02:43:13.914
[SPEAKER_17]: They're on, basically the users are giving them what they're supposed to do.

02:43:13.934 --> 02:43:20.355
[SPEAKER_17]: Like, for example, they had just tried to cross a river and cocked their wagon and it tipped over and now Sarah's dead.

02:43:21.055 --> 02:43:23.076
[SPEAKER_17]: So it's one of the hosts is dead now.

02:43:23.616 --> 02:43:23.936
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just,

02:43:25.129 --> 02:43:27.011
[SPEAKER_17]: It doesn't even sound like they're trying to do anything.

02:43:27.031 --> 02:43:28.072
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, so it's not an MMO.

02:43:28.252 --> 02:43:29.493
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it's not an actual game.

02:43:29.553 --> 02:43:30.914
[SPEAKER_17]: It's just something fun they're doing on forums.

02:43:30.934 --> 02:43:32.215
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm putting the phone down then.

02:43:32.355 --> 02:43:33.216
[SPEAKER_18]: We don't have to call the lawyers.

02:43:34.377 --> 02:43:35.077
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll put the phone down.

02:43:35.958 --> 02:43:37.780
[SPEAKER_18]: But I was a little irritated there for a minute.

02:43:38.060 --> 02:43:40.722
[SPEAKER_18]: I thought my rights was feeling violated there a little bit.

02:43:41.343 --> 02:43:51.311
[SPEAKER_17]: See, because day one, what they do, it says, we started on an on-set game of the classic role-playing game, Oregon Trail, and we want you to play along with us.

02:43:52.091 --> 02:43:53.312
[SPEAKER_17]: And it says, so basically...

02:43:55.114 --> 02:43:58.056
[SPEAKER_17]: Basically what they've done is they're just actually doing it.

02:43:58.116 --> 02:44:04.261
[SPEAKER_17]: They're playing the actual game in studio or whatever when naming all the people as the host names.

02:44:04.921 --> 02:44:08.744
[SPEAKER_17]: And so then they're basically having the users tell them what to do next.

02:44:10.125 --> 02:44:10.445
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay.

02:44:10.925 --> 02:44:11.746
[SPEAKER_17]: That's all it is.

02:44:11.806 --> 02:44:15.008
[SPEAKER_18]: We could do that too if we wanted to, but we've got better things to do with our time.

02:44:15.508 --> 02:44:15.889
[SPEAKER_17]: Exactly.

02:44:15.909 --> 02:44:18.290
[SPEAKER_18]: When I play Oregon Trail, I want my own private game.

02:44:18.310 --> 02:44:19.771
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't want you people telling me what to do with it.

02:44:20.172 --> 02:44:24.495
[SPEAKER_17]: We need to mod Grand Theft Auto San Andreas to play Oregon Trail on.

02:44:24.515 --> 02:44:24.735
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

02:44:26.656 --> 02:44:29.497
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright kids, you guys have been asking for it.

02:44:29.537 --> 02:44:33.179
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been like a month since we've been able to do this.

02:44:33.239 --> 02:44:35.860
[SPEAKER_18]: We are going to do a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:44:36.220 --> 02:44:41.602
[SPEAKER_18]: Send a private message to Sky with any question you want to ask us and we'll get to those questions as soon as this break is over.

02:44:41.622 --> 02:44:45.584
[SPEAKER_18]: We're going to start it off with a little bit of Taku in this break with Electro-Tuned.

02:44:45.624 --> 02:44:45.864
[SPEAKER_18]: Enjoy.

02:46:28.386 --> 02:46:34.873
[SPEAKER_09]: Night is the night, funky music is the night Oh, do you wanna funky music?

02:46:35.313 --> 02:46:40.619
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody funky music Night is the night, funky music is the night Oh, do you wanna funky music?

02:46:58.655 --> 02:46:59.498
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for watching!

02:47:36.838 --> 02:47:37.819
[SPEAKER_09]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft,

02:48:11.329 --> 02:48:20.692
[SPEAKER_25]: And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.

02:48:21.435 --> 02:48:25.517
[SPEAKER_18]: Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.

02:48:25.538 --> 02:48:26.498
[SPEAKER_18]: Can we talk about that?

02:48:26.778 --> 02:48:29.120
[SPEAKER_09]: No subject will ever be taboo.

02:48:29.420 --> 02:48:33.042
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.

02:48:33.582 --> 02:48:36.104
[SPEAKER_18]: Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.

02:48:36.624 --> 02:48:41.967
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?

02:48:42.527 --> 02:48:43.808
[SPEAKER_09]: I collect your fucking head.

02:48:45.777 --> 02:48:47.258
[SPEAKER_09]: Just like this fucker here.

02:48:48.359 --> 02:48:52.042
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?

02:48:52.342 --> 02:48:55.684
[SPEAKER_21]: The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!

02:48:56.645 --> 02:49:03.089
[SPEAKER_08]: Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!

02:49:04.330 --> 02:49:08.033
[SPEAKER_25]: Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.

02:49:10.956 --> 02:49:15.559
[SPEAKER_18]: In that break, electro-tuned and from Puppet Up, Funky Tonight, let's get into Ask Orange Lounge.

02:49:19.862 --> 02:49:22.784
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.

02:49:23.344 --> 02:49:26.627
[SPEAKER_18]: What will we find out tonight on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:49:27.067 --> 02:49:31.670
[SPEAKER_18]: It's been a little while since we've done this segment with new listeners.

02:49:31.750 --> 02:49:33.992
[SPEAKER_18]: Tonight should be a barrel of monkeys fun.

02:49:38.014 --> 02:49:39.255
[SPEAKER_17]: A barrel of monkeys fun?

02:49:39.275 --> 02:49:40.316
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, a barrel of monkeys fun.

02:49:40.592 --> 02:49:41.793
[SPEAKER_18]: Remember those little barrel of monkeys?

02:49:41.833 --> 02:49:44.454
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, but it's a monkey's fun.

02:49:46.976 --> 02:49:51.119
[SPEAKER_18]: VXJasonXV, our one and only webmaster, starts us off tonight.

02:49:51.599 --> 02:49:55.061
[SPEAKER_18]: Orange Lounge, why does Wyoming suck so freaking badly?

02:49:55.922 --> 02:49:58.123
[SPEAKER_18]: You know, we might have a listener or two from Wyoming.

02:49:58.143 --> 02:49:59.784
[SPEAKER_18]: Isn't that where Jackson Hole is?

02:49:59.844 --> 02:50:01.025
[SPEAKER_18]: That's right, Jackson Hole is there.

02:50:01.065 --> 02:50:02.086
[SPEAKER_18]: That would be why it sucks.

02:50:02.589 --> 02:50:04.391
[SPEAKER_18]: No, I... It's very green.

02:50:04.411 --> 02:50:05.111
[SPEAKER_18]: It is a large hole.

02:50:05.371 --> 02:50:07.773
[SPEAKER_18]: It's... The reason why it sucks is because nobody lives there.

02:50:08.294 --> 02:50:09.194
[SPEAKER_18]: So there's not a lot to do.

02:50:09.695 --> 02:50:10.215
[SPEAKER_18]: Unless you like snow.

02:50:10.235 --> 02:50:10.696
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

02:50:10.876 --> 02:50:11.476
[SPEAKER_18]: But it's very pretty.

02:50:11.656 --> 02:50:11.997
[SPEAKER_15]: You know what?

02:50:12.137 --> 02:50:12.337
[SPEAKER_23]: What?

02:50:12.797 --> 02:50:14.018
[SPEAKER_15]: My mother-in-law was born in Wyoming.

02:50:15.319 --> 02:50:18.682
[SPEAKER_23]: I've been across Wyoming three times and I stopped like four times.

02:50:20.183 --> 02:50:22.045
[SPEAKER_23]: And most of those stops were at Little America.

02:50:22.065 --> 02:50:22.565
[SPEAKER_23]: Yay, 35 cent ice cream.

02:50:26.125 --> 02:50:35.934
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Tetsuya, what licensed Konami original DDR song would you girls and guys most like to see in Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3?

02:50:35.974 --> 02:50:38.736
[SPEAKER_18]: Anybody want to kick us off?

02:50:38.776 --> 02:50:41.799
[SPEAKER_18]: What licensed song do you really want to see in Extreme 2 or Ultramix 3?

02:50:42.439 --> 02:50:44.341
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like new Echo Image, Kthanks.

02:50:44.721 --> 02:50:45.982
[SPEAKER_18]: Neverending Story, Kthanks.

02:50:47.543 --> 02:50:48.985
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, Loki, anything?

02:50:50.926 --> 02:50:51.527
[SPEAKER_18]: Get Loki a mic.

02:50:52.705 --> 02:50:54.985
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure you need a mic.

02:50:55.346 --> 02:51:01.527
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to say, I think we need some Ultimate Cheeseburger in there.

02:51:03.507 --> 02:51:04.747
[SPEAKER_18]: The Ultimate Cheeseburger song?

02:51:06.948 --> 02:51:08.448
[SPEAKER_15]: Debbie Gibson's Electric Blue.

02:51:09.528 --> 02:51:11.269
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't you mean Electric Youth?

02:51:11.309 --> 02:51:12.009
[SPEAKER_15]: Electric Youth, yeah.

02:51:12.069 --> 02:51:13.369
[SPEAKER_15]: I was thinking of Into the Blue.

02:51:14.229 --> 02:51:14.689
[SPEAKER_20]: I got one.

02:51:15.170 --> 02:51:16.210
[SPEAKER_20]: What?

02:51:16.270 --> 02:51:17.610
[SPEAKER_20]: Might not have heard it, though.

02:51:17.670 --> 02:51:20.691
[SPEAKER_20]: Expansion Union, playing with lightning.

02:51:20.731 --> 02:51:22.411
[SPEAKER_20]: You may have heard it on the movie Blade.

02:51:31.194 --> 02:51:34.997
[SPEAKER_18]: Legend of Zaku wants to know, how come girls love the smell of Axe body spray?

02:51:35.637 --> 02:51:38.139
[SPEAKER_18]: And as a gay male, I can tell you, it's not only the girls.

02:51:40.920 --> 02:51:41.901
[SPEAKER_18]: That's all I'll say about that.

02:51:42.461 --> 02:51:47.564
[SPEAKER_18]: Being a Hispanic, do you have any good pickup lines for picking up white chicks?

02:51:49.326 --> 02:51:51.487
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, I'll defer that question to you.

02:51:51.963 --> 02:51:53.723
[SPEAKER_18]: Have any good lines for picking up white chicks?

02:51:57.844 --> 02:51:59.224
[SPEAKER_10]: Who's Hispanic here?

02:52:00.064 --> 02:52:01.745
[SPEAKER_18]: Legend of Zaku is a Hispanic.

02:52:01.765 --> 02:52:02.365
[SPEAKER_10]: Which one of us?

02:52:02.705 --> 02:52:05.585
[SPEAKER_18]: You're a white chick, so you should know what pickup lines would work on you.

02:52:05.605 --> 02:52:05.965
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm married!

02:52:06.365 --> 02:52:10.966
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, but imagine it's, you know, five years ago before, how long have you known Dan?

02:52:11.166 --> 02:52:11.546
[SPEAKER_18]: Five years?

02:52:11.986 --> 02:52:12.286
[SPEAKER_18]: Six years?

02:52:12.547 --> 02:52:13.427
[SPEAKER_18]: Imagine it's seven years ago.

02:52:13.447 --> 02:52:15.327
[SPEAKER_15]: I've known Dan for ten years.

02:52:15.347 --> 02:52:18.588
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, then eleven years ago, what was a pickup line that would have worked on you?

02:52:18.648 --> 02:52:21.088
[SPEAKER_15]: Eleven years ago, I was like in high school.

02:52:21.735 --> 02:52:22.396
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, I'll tell you that.

02:52:22.436 --> 02:52:22.756
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

02:52:22.856 --> 02:52:23.116
[SPEAKER_18]: Here it is.

02:52:24.037 --> 02:52:26.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Hey baby, I like peanut butter.

02:52:26.439 --> 02:52:27.200
[SPEAKER_18]: Wanna fuck?

02:52:28.120 --> 02:52:28.501
[SPEAKER_18]: There it is.

02:52:28.721 --> 02:52:29.241
[SPEAKER_15]: That's simple.

02:52:30.202 --> 02:52:35.626
[SPEAKER_15]: It's called Be Genuine, Don't Be an Asshole, and Don't Go Hey Chica.

02:52:38.269 --> 02:52:41.651
[SPEAKER_15]: Because yeah, that actually has been tried on me before and I shot that down.

02:52:41.992 --> 02:52:42.272
[SPEAKER_18]: All right.

02:52:45.261 --> 02:52:46.401
[SPEAKER_15]: And Don't Day Girls in Wyoming.

02:52:46.701 --> 02:52:51.925
[SPEAKER_18]: Socorino wants to know, why isn't G-Deca the song for chatroom FUs or any FUs at all?

02:52:52.305 --> 02:52:54.146
[SPEAKER_18]: I have used that before.

02:52:54.526 --> 02:52:56.848
[SPEAKER_18]: It rotates for the chatroom FUs, the song every week.

02:52:57.528 --> 02:53:01.391
[SPEAKER_18]: Will the Orange Lounge Radio crew sign a copy of In the Groove if I send one to them?

02:53:01.731 --> 02:53:03.052
[SPEAKER_18]: Sure, but that doesn't mean we'll send it back.

02:53:04.393 --> 02:53:05.794
[SPEAKER_18]: And a special... No, we will.

02:53:05.814 --> 02:53:07.595
[SPEAKER_18]: Will we sign it?

02:53:11.148 --> 02:53:11.989
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, I guess.

02:53:12.049 --> 02:53:14.771
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, yeah, we will, but we don't take responsibility for what we write on it.

02:53:16.212 --> 02:53:17.613
[SPEAKER_23]: But what will you sign it with?

02:53:19.495 --> 02:53:20.075
[SPEAKER_18]: My dick!

02:53:21.876 --> 02:53:24.038
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, I'll rub my fat cock against it.

02:53:27.400 --> 02:53:28.841
[SPEAKER_18]: Two fat cocks, rubbing together.

02:53:29.502 --> 02:53:29.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Oil.

02:53:30.983 --> 02:53:31.343
[SPEAKER_18]: Forget it.

02:53:31.383 --> 02:53:32.864
[SPEAKER_18]: Bad Orange Lounge Radio inside joke.

02:53:33.845 --> 02:53:35.306
[SPEAKER_18]: And a special question for Loki.

02:53:35.366 --> 02:53:40.270
[SPEAKER_18]: What do you think of the subliminal anal sex if you wear polarized lenses while playing Graffiti Kingdom?

02:53:43.251 --> 02:53:43.471
[SPEAKER_17]: What?

02:53:46.092 --> 02:53:53.734
[SPEAKER_17]: Granted, there would be some characters we might draw that look like, you know, anal sex, but, um, what?

02:53:58.255 --> 02:54:00.816
[SPEAKER_18]: Acer800 wants to know, what's monkeys fun?

02:54:01.156 --> 02:54:03.056
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, and what's the square root of 443,556?

02:54:03.697 --> 02:54:07.638
[SPEAKER_18]: Uh, get a calculator.

02:54:08.418 --> 02:54:09.978
[SPEAKER_18]: Seriously, just get a calculator.

02:54:10.298 --> 02:54:12.619
[SPEAKER_18]: In fact, actually, I think I have one on my desktop here, if I can

02:54:13.379 --> 02:54:21.785
[SPEAKER_18]: Fire up the calculator program here, and I will switch that over to the scientific mode, because scientific mode will allow me to do square roots here.

02:54:21.825 --> 02:54:22.485
[SPEAKER_17]: It has more buttons.

02:54:22.725 --> 02:54:25.147
[SPEAKER_18]: It has more buttons, that means it must work better, right?

02:54:25.487 --> 02:54:28.269
[SPEAKER_18]: So, 4, 4, 3, 5, 5, 6, where's the square root button?

02:54:28.549 --> 02:54:29.470
[SPEAKER_18]: I know it's on here somewhere, right?

02:54:30.070 --> 02:54:30.670
[SPEAKER_18]: Oh, shit.

02:54:30.690 --> 02:54:30.670
6, 6, 6.

02:54:31.911 --> 02:54:32.272
[SPEAKER_18]: Shit.

02:54:32.772 --> 02:54:33.793
[SPEAKER_18]: Is it 6, 6, 6, really?

02:54:35.133 --> 02:54:36.154
[SPEAKER_18]: Damn you, bugs, damn you.

02:54:37.175 --> 02:54:38.856
[SPEAKER_18]: Ha, ha, ha, 6, 6, 6, devil joke.

02:54:41.275 --> 02:54:44.077
[SPEAKER_18]: MPQ, is there any point in playing 2DX one-handed?

02:54:45.718 --> 02:54:46.819
[SPEAKER_17]: So you can masturbate with the other.

02:54:51.722 --> 02:54:57.385
[SPEAKER_18]: Dark Knight wants to know, okay cast, what do you think was the best Orange Lounge Radio bad joke of all time?

02:54:57.445 --> 02:54:58.746
[SPEAKER_18]: Let me rephrase that, worst.

02:55:02.629 --> 02:55:04.670
[SPEAKER_18]: I would say the bleached asshole thing went way too far.

02:55:06.161 --> 02:55:12.486
[SPEAKER_15]: SSJ100 Matt wants to know, besides Kid Icarus, what characters would you like to see in the next Super Smash Bros.? ?

02:55:37.432 --> 02:55:38.052
[SPEAKER_18]: Samus vs. The Guardian

02:56:06.742 --> 02:56:13.706
[SPEAKER_15]: Even though it wasn't purely Nintendo, because it was first on MSX, wouldn't that just be an awesome fight?

02:56:14.027 --> 02:56:15.968
[SPEAKER_15]: Because I think it would be a pretty dead-even match.

02:56:16.648 --> 02:56:19.129
[SPEAKER_15]: Except that I think the Guardian actually gets more weapons.

02:56:19.149 --> 02:56:20.230
[SPEAKER_18]: I want to see Nestor.

02:56:22.371 --> 02:56:23.252
[SPEAKER_18]: Howard and Nestor?

02:56:24.112 --> 02:56:26.494
[SPEAKER_18]: I would like to see on the next Super Smash Bros.

02:56:26.594 --> 02:56:28.475
[SPEAKER_18]: a Nintendog get in there.

02:56:29.415 --> 02:56:29.815
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah!

02:56:30.476 --> 02:56:31.336
[SPEAKER_18]: Get a puppy in there.

02:56:31.396 --> 02:56:32.057
[SPEAKER_15]: Puppy battle!

02:56:32.317 --> 02:56:33.257
[SPEAKER_15]: And he poops on you.

02:56:33.618 --> 02:56:34.158
[SPEAKER_20]: Alright, I know...

02:56:34.878 --> 02:56:41.003
[SPEAKER_20]: Seriously, I know we have probably enough Fire Emblem characters in current Smash Bros.

02:56:41.043 --> 02:56:43.505
[SPEAKER_20]: Melee, but I would like to see Hector in there.

02:56:44.746 --> 02:56:48.409
[SPEAKER_20]: I would like to see at least someone representing an axe.

02:56:48.829 --> 02:56:49.890
[SPEAKER_18]: Okay, alright.

02:56:50.771 --> 02:56:52.612
[SPEAKER_18]: Alright, I think we've given you a lot of good ideas there.

02:56:53.433 --> 02:56:56.896
[SPEAKER_18]: Anyway, moving on, Sefi would like to know, and this is the

02:56:57.628 --> 02:57:02.053
[SPEAKER_18]: Perennial question that comes up once every 50 shows or so, so there's no problem we can't answer this again.

02:57:02.513 --> 02:57:05.216
[SPEAKER_18]: Where did you guys come up with the name Orange Lounge?

02:57:05.996 --> 02:57:09.300
[SPEAKER_18]: So, we get this question quite a bit, no biggie.

02:57:09.800 --> 02:57:10.601
[SPEAKER_18]: My fault.

02:57:12.183 --> 02:57:15.386
[SPEAKER_18]: Well, no, wait, we both came up with this when we were on the train there.

02:57:16.334 --> 02:57:21.478
[SPEAKER_18]: We knew we wanted to do a radio station that had to do with DDR and Bimani Games was kind of the root.

02:57:21.518 --> 02:57:24.460
[SPEAKER_18]: We started with our love of music-based video games.

02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:34.747
[SPEAKER_18]: The podcast was separate because we knew we wanted to grow eventually outside the mold of music-based games and talk about other video games because we're gamers first and music game fans second.

02:57:35.167 --> 02:57:41.391
[SPEAKER_18]: But we knew when we first started this whole thing in 2001, we wanted to do something dedicated to specifically the music video games.

02:57:41.992 --> 02:57:45.594
[SPEAKER_18]: And Orange Lounge is a band that does some of the music for these games.

02:57:46.755 --> 02:57:47.775
[SPEAKER_18]: That's Orange Lounge right there.

02:57:51.578 --> 02:57:55.580
[SPEAKER_18]: And Orange Lounge just sounded like a good radio show name.

02:57:55.620 --> 02:57:58.742
[SPEAKER_18]: Because like a lounge, like we're lounging around and talking about games.

02:57:58.942 --> 02:58:05.867
[SPEAKER_18]: Because the feel of the show is very much the feel I think that we're trying to emulate from the show I used to be a part of, which is Under Sedation Live.

02:58:06.387 --> 02:58:09.929
[SPEAKER_18]: Where it was just a bunch of us and it sounded like we were sitting around at Denny's talking about nothing.

02:58:10.349 --> 02:58:11.410
[SPEAKER_15]: I visited there a lot.

02:58:12.236 --> 02:58:15.137
[SPEAKER_15]: I filled in for you once, and I filled in for Iguana Girl once.

02:58:15.197 --> 02:58:16.898
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura was a frequent guest over on our station live.

02:58:17.118 --> 02:58:20.300
[SPEAKER_18]: So we're just trying to create that Denny's talking about whatever vibe.

02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:22.301
[SPEAKER_18]: So that's us, Orange Lounge.

02:58:25.817 --> 02:58:26.577
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got to hurry up here.

02:58:26.617 --> 02:58:27.618
[SPEAKER_18]: We've got a bunch of questions still.

02:58:28.938 --> 02:58:30.159
[SPEAKER_18]: Lots of questions here.

02:58:30.259 --> 02:58:35.000
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm going to ask just one of them from NM64.

02:58:35.901 --> 02:58:39.342
[SPEAKER_18]: What's going to be the first game you'll download for the Nintendo Revolution?

02:58:39.642 --> 02:58:42.043
[SPEAKER_18]: One NES, SNES, and Nintendo 64.

02:58:42.123 --> 02:58:44.704
[SPEAKER_15]: If it could be any?

02:58:45.184 --> 02:58:45.344
[SPEAKER_18]: Any.

02:58:46.585 --> 02:58:48.045
[SPEAKER_18]: Actually, Nintendo's catalog.

02:58:48.245 --> 02:58:49.206
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's say Nintendo's catalog.

02:58:49.226 --> 02:58:50.286
[SPEAKER_15]: Fuck, no Guardian Legend.

02:58:51.226 --> 02:58:52.107
[SPEAKER_18]: Because that would really be it.

02:58:52.367 --> 02:58:52.727
[SPEAKER_18]: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

02:58:54.555 --> 02:58:55.916
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, Nintendo.

02:58:58.038 --> 02:58:58.459
[SPEAKER_18]: I'll start.

02:58:58.599 --> 02:58:59.039
[SPEAKER_18]: I know mine.

02:58:59.159 --> 02:59:00.881
[SPEAKER_18]: Kid Icarus, duh.

02:59:01.201 --> 02:59:03.123
[SPEAKER_18]: Super Mario Kart or Super Metroid.

02:59:03.323 --> 02:59:03.923
[SPEAKER_18]: It's a tough call.

02:59:04.244 --> 02:59:04.704
[SPEAKER_18]: One of the two.

02:59:05.265 --> 02:59:08.067
[SPEAKER_18]: And 64, Mario 64.

02:59:08.928 --> 02:59:12.431
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay, mine would be... No, Pokemon Snap.

02:59:17.065 --> 02:59:19.327
[SPEAKER_15]: I would probably have to say Kid Icarus.

02:59:20.748 --> 02:59:27.634
[SPEAKER_15]: And then either Star Fox or Zelda A Link to the Past, probably Zelda.

02:59:29.415 --> 02:59:31.857
[SPEAKER_15]: And then 64, it would be Ocarina.

02:59:33.939 --> 02:59:34.199
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki?

02:59:36.881 --> 02:59:41.425
[SPEAKER_17]: I would have to say, I guess, Super Mario Bros., I guess.

02:59:41.645 --> 02:59:44.307
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I would have to do...

02:59:46.984 --> 02:59:53.267
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, Legend of Zelda, Link to the Past, and then Star Fox 64.

02:59:53.328 --> 02:59:54.688
[SPEAKER_17]: Ooh, good call.

02:59:54.868 --> 02:59:55.289
[SPEAKER_17]: That was fun.

02:59:57.310 --> 03:00:00.091
[SPEAKER_17]: Because Mario 64, I'm tired of it after the DS.

03:00:00.531 --> 03:00:02.472
[SPEAKER_15]: Too bad we never got Robotech Crystal Dreams.

03:00:03.353 --> 03:00:04.093
[SPEAKER_18]: We gotta hurry, we gotta hurry.

03:00:04.133 --> 03:00:05.574
[SPEAKER_18]: More questions here, we gotta get through, we're running over.

03:00:06.150 --> 03:00:08.692
[SPEAKER_18]: Rene would like to know, I've got a Beatmania noob question.

03:00:08.772 --> 03:00:13.855
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm anticipating the US version, and I'm wondering how far the game makes you go to make the music.

03:00:14.235 --> 03:00:17.137
[SPEAKER_18]: Are we going to have to key in every aspect of the song that's being played?

03:00:19.858 --> 03:00:22.160
[SPEAKER_18]: On the anothers, pretty much yes.

03:00:22.620 --> 03:00:29.784
[SPEAKER_18]: But on the easy ones, and when you get into beginner modes, like hitting one button will do the whole range.

03:00:29.844 --> 03:00:31.946
[SPEAKER_18]: Whereas in 7 key mode, you would actually have to hit...

03:00:35.472 --> 03:00:38.873
[SPEAKER_18]: It dumbs down the key notes, obviously, when you go into easy mode.

03:00:39.433 --> 03:00:53.397
[SPEAKER_18]: And in fact, a lot of times in easy mode, if you just watch what happens, go into easy mode and just start the song and don't press anything at all, you'll actually hear that quite a bit of the backbeat is already presented and you're usually just playing along to a melody or something.

03:00:53.417 --> 03:00:57.318
[SPEAKER_18]: And usually seven keys just kind of adds in a backbeat or light seven, I don't know.

03:00:57.699 --> 03:00:58.739
[SPEAKER_18]: They get progressively harder.

03:00:58.839 --> 03:01:02.920
[SPEAKER_18]: It's not till the anothers where you're pretty much really having to play every beat.

03:01:03.340 --> 03:01:04.601
[SPEAKER_18]: So, don't get scared off.

03:01:05.341 --> 03:01:09.043
[SPEAKER_18]: Especially, you know the American one is going to have a very accessible beginner mode.

03:01:09.443 --> 03:01:11.584
[SPEAKER_18]: Light 7, 7 key, another progression.

03:01:11.684 --> 03:01:13.425
[SPEAKER_18]: Assuming that another's make it to America.

03:01:13.785 --> 03:01:14.825
[SPEAKER_18]: But I don't see why they wouldn't.

03:01:14.845 --> 03:01:16.506
[SPEAKER_18]: It would be really stupid of Konami not to do it.

03:01:17.146 --> 03:01:20.087
[SPEAKER_18]: He also would like to note, Rini would like to say, Popcoon porn is hooray.

03:01:20.328 --> 03:01:21.328
[SPEAKER_18]: You just want to push their buttons.

03:01:22.428 --> 03:01:22.749
[SPEAKER_18]: Right.

03:01:24.049 --> 03:01:26.430
[SPEAKER_18]: Lastly, last question from Goggle.

03:01:26.450 --> 03:01:27.291
[SPEAKER_18]: This is a good one to end in.

03:01:27.311 --> 03:01:29.592
[SPEAKER_18]: And sorry to those of you guys whose questions we didn't get to tonight.

03:01:29.932 --> 03:01:32.633
[SPEAKER_18]: Goggle would like to know, why do I have to take economics?

03:01:34.349 --> 03:01:38.974
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura, you are a motivational person here that motivates us to learn and get education.

03:01:38.994 --> 03:01:39.574
[SPEAKER_15]: Economics?

03:01:39.695 --> 03:01:40.776
[SPEAKER_18]: Yeah, why do you have to take economics?

03:01:40.976 --> 03:01:45.561
[SPEAKER_15]: Because colleges are fucking retarded to make us take all these classes we don't need to have nothing to do with our majors.

03:01:46.842 --> 03:01:51.086
[SPEAKER_15]: What is world geography going to do me in an art major?

03:01:52.628 --> 03:01:52.948
[SPEAKER_18]: Thank you.

03:01:52.968 --> 03:01:53.829
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean economics.

03:01:55.267 --> 03:01:57.609
[SPEAKER_18]: That was a very nice motivational speech there.

03:01:57.629 --> 03:01:58.429
[SPEAKER_18]: I appreciate that.

03:01:58.509 --> 03:02:03.732
[SPEAKER_15]: You take it because they make you, then you use your economic skills to make their bank accounts suffer.

03:02:03.893 --> 03:02:05.033
[SPEAKER_18]: So you can balance your checkbook?

03:02:05.133 --> 03:02:05.514
[SPEAKER_18]: I don't know.

03:02:06.334 --> 03:02:10.597
[SPEAKER_15]: No, that's not even what it's... I know, I know.

03:02:10.617 --> 03:02:16.621
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm going to make my friend who was a math major at UCSD take my math aptitude test so that I don't have to take any of it.

03:02:18.522 --> 03:02:19.142
[SPEAKER_18]: All right, kids.

03:02:19.182 --> 03:02:20.663
[SPEAKER_18]: We're at the end of the show, boys and girls.

03:02:20.783 --> 03:02:24.586
[SPEAKER_18]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting off with Magus.

03:02:25.179 --> 03:02:26.460
[SPEAKER_18]: If we can get Magus' final thought here.

03:02:29.381 --> 03:02:29.662
[SPEAKER_18]: Food.

03:02:30.762 --> 03:02:30.982
[SPEAKER_18]: Angel.

03:02:32.643 --> 03:02:34.264
[SPEAKER_11]: I think Rob summed it up earlier.

03:02:35.025 --> 03:02:35.265
[SPEAKER_11]: Ow.

03:02:35.605 --> 03:02:35.885
[SPEAKER_18]: Bugged.

03:02:36.025 --> 03:02:37.106
[SPEAKER_11]: That's okay, I needed that.

03:02:37.286 --> 03:02:37.606
[SPEAKER_18]: Bugged.

03:02:38.126 --> 03:02:38.447
[SPEAKER_18]: Burnout 4.

03:02:39.707 --> 03:02:40.028
[SPEAKER_18]: Loki.

03:02:42.149 --> 03:02:44.150
[SPEAKER_17]: I need time for Final Fantasy XI.

03:02:46.111 --> 03:02:47.612
[SPEAKER_18]: My final thought is Milkshake.

03:02:48.292 --> 03:02:48.913
[SPEAKER_18]: DarkSakura.

03:02:49.753 --> 03:02:51.094
[SPEAKER_15]: Reject false monkey butlers.

03:02:52.318 --> 03:02:53.318
[SPEAKER_18]: The final word of the show.

03:02:53.478 --> 03:02:54.579
[SPEAKER_18]: One word to sum it all up.

03:02:54.639 --> 03:02:55.539
[SPEAKER_18]: See you kids next week.

03:02:55.579 --> 03:02:56.539
[SPEAKER_18]: Listen to our podcast.

03:02:56.579 --> 03:02:57.239
[SPEAKER_18]: Vote us a five.

03:02:57.259 --> 03:02:59.140
[SPEAKER_18]: Whore out Orange Lounge Radio to the masses.

03:02:59.200 --> 03:02:59.660
[SPEAKER_18]: Love you long time.

03:02:59.680 --> 03:03:02.081
[SPEAKER_11]: And listen to the title of the volume.

03:03:02.121 --> 03:03:02.801
[SPEAKER_18]: Last word of the show.

03:03:02.881 --> 03:03:04.261
[SPEAKER_18]: Magus, one word to sum it all up.

03:03:04.962 --> 03:03:05.342
[SPEAKER_20]: Noobs.

03:03:07.002 --> 03:03:11.864
[SPEAKER_26]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:03:12.684 --> 03:03:16.825
[SPEAKER_26]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

03:03:17.549 --> 03:03:29.654
[SPEAKER_26]: For more information about our station, visit our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

03:03:46.678 --> 03:03:48.000
[SPEAKER_01]: The devil went to Jamaica.

03:03:48.080 --> 03:03:49.762
[SPEAKER_01]: He was looking to sell some weed.

03:03:49.862 --> 03:03:50.844
[SPEAKER_01]: He was doing fine.

03:03:50.884 --> 03:03:51.865
[SPEAKER_01]: They were standing in line.

03:03:51.905 --> 03:03:53.247
[SPEAKER_01]: It was excellent weed indeed.

03:03:53.728 --> 03:04:00.497
[SPEAKER_01]: When he came across this young man who was likewise peddling pot, and the devil slid down the beach to the kid and said, Boy, let me tell you what.

03:04:01.201 --> 03:04:04.063
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess you kind of figured I'm a reefer head, of course.

03:04:04.503 --> 03:04:07.845
[SPEAKER_01]: And after all this time, I guess that I'm a connoisseur of sorts.

03:04:08.285 --> 03:04:11.367
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, your stuff smells okay, but this could tranquilize a horse.

03:04:11.647 --> 03:04:15.069
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll bet a million in cash against your stash, because I think mine's better than yours.

03:04:15.570 --> 03:04:18.752
[SPEAKER_01]: The boy said, my name's Johnny, and you ain't smoked nothing yet.

03:04:19.272 --> 03:04:20.933
[SPEAKER_01]: One hit of this grass will kick your ass.

03:04:20.973 --> 03:04:22.234
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got yourself a bed.

03:04:22.894 --> 03:04:36.833
[SPEAKER_01]: Johnny, roll a ball of hash and make sure it's the bomb Cause the devil's got the kind of stuff they smoked in Vietnam You'll get a million smackaroos in cash if you can cope But if you can't, the devil'll get your dope

03:04:44.528 --> 03:04:51.072
[SPEAKER_01]: The devil packed a bong with a little Acapulco gold and resin flew from his fingertips as he fired up his bowl.

03:04:51.552 --> 03:04:54.634
[SPEAKER_01]: He filled that chamber all the way and he took a mighty hit.

03:04:55.255 --> 03:04:58.416
[SPEAKER_01]: As they passed it back and forth, it gave them both a coughing fit.

03:04:58.737 --> 03:04:58.897
Damn!

03:05:13.081 --> 03:05:19.988
[SPEAKER_01]: When the bowl was finished, Johnny said, hey man, that stuff was great, but fill your lungs with some of this and prepare to vegetate.

03:05:20.508 --> 03:05:22.510
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, sativa, sweet Mary Jane.

03:05:24.112 --> 03:05:26.074
[SPEAKER_01]: The devil's in the backyard frying his brain.

03:05:27.815 --> 03:05:29.617
[SPEAKER_01]: Zigzag filled with a diggity dank.

03:05:31.459 --> 03:05:33.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on tight, it'll hit you like a tank.

03:05:38.283 --> 03:06:04.752
[SPEAKER_01]: The devil nodded off because he knew that he was stoned And he asked if he could buy an ounce of the stuff that Johnny owned Johnny said, devil, just come on back if you ever want to catch a buzz I done told you once, you son of a bitch, mine's the best there ever was And they fired up doobies one by one Ain't it gonna stop till the bag is done Green as a bullfrog's sticky-ass glue Granny, do you get high?

03:06:04.812 --> 03:06:05.652
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I do

03:06:14.344 --> 03:06:17.886
[SPEAKER_26]: Thank you very much for listening and we'll see you next week.
