00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:02,900
[SPEAKER_01]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 19th, 2005.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:13,525
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:13,805 --> 00:00:17,306
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,127 --> 00:00:27,531
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, everybody, once again, and welcome to Orange Lounge Radio To Go, a radio dedicated to what gamers really want to know.

5
00:00:28,322 --> 00:00:29,223
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that little bastard on...

6
00:00:55,791 --> 00:00:57,612
[SPEAKER_04]: What was that site?

7
00:00:57,652 --> 00:00:59,734
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to name it.

8
00:01:00,014 --> 00:01:08,720
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just have to say that I've probably been gaming since that little newbie wannabe was in diapers.

9
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: I was sitting there with my Pong machine back in the day.

10
00:01:14,104 --> 00:01:16,545
[SPEAKER_04]: I am more the gamer than you will ever hope to be.

11
00:01:18,032 --> 00:01:21,535
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to address it and get it out of my system.

12
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:22,175
[SPEAKER_01]: Feel better?

13
00:01:22,475 --> 00:01:23,916
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I actually do feel a lot better.

14
00:01:24,116 --> 00:01:26,758
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's also proof that I'm anything but giggly and ditzy.

15
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:27,479
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.

16
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:29,420
[SPEAKER_01]: She's a real bitch, ladies and gentlemen.

17
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:29,520
[SPEAKER_01]: I am.

18
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:30,281
[SPEAKER_01]: I really am.

19
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:31,742
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

20
00:01:32,802 --> 00:01:34,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Tech Master Loki.

21
00:01:34,143 --> 00:01:34,623
[SPEAKER_01]: How you doing?

22
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:35,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm doing good.

23
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,565
[SPEAKER_01]: Who also is a really big bitch, if you get to know him.

24
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:39,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Huh?

25
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:40,186
[SPEAKER_01]: No, forget it.

26
00:01:40,766 --> 00:01:41,287
[SPEAKER_01]: What's on your mind?

27
00:01:41,627 --> 00:01:42,407
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, how you doing?

28
00:01:42,888 --> 00:01:43,688
[SPEAKER_01]: Not much.

29
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:45,429
[SPEAKER_01]: What the hell is this you're looking at?

30
00:01:45,629 --> 00:01:48,471
[SPEAKER_01]: Is this like Deer Hunter on the Xbox 360 or something?

31
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:49,271
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this screenshot you've got?

32
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,872
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's a screenshot of Elder Scrolls 4.

33
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:54,114
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a Deer Hunter game to me.

34
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:57,916
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the deer from the deer scene in Ring 2, which sucked.

35
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:01,598
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, they will come out with a Deer Hunter game, I'm sure, for that game.

36
00:02:02,096 --> 00:02:04,537
[SPEAKER_01]: For the Walmart arcades across America.

37
00:02:04,797 --> 00:02:11,340
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever noticed that every Walmart arcade, quote unquote, you've ever walked into, has some type of deer hunting machine, at least around here.

38
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:14,461
[SPEAKER_01]: There's always some type of deer hunting machine and a crane.

39
00:02:14,927 --> 00:02:17,068
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, what have you been playing this week?

40
00:02:17,088 --> 00:02:26,610
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you've been doing a lot of giggling and having all those slumber parties and talking about boys, but if you actually had any time to play some games, what were you able to find?

41
00:02:36,977 --> 00:02:44,023
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I don't know, out of the 40-something video game systems that I own, have I not been able to find something to play?

42
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:49,006
[SPEAKER_04]: No, seriously, I've been playing my Nintendogs, trying to keep them from running away and pissing on my dinner.

43
00:02:49,147 --> 00:02:50,408
[SPEAKER_01]: That's such a girl game!

44
00:02:50,888 --> 00:02:51,749
[SPEAKER_04]: You play it too, okay?

45
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:52,729
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, that's right.

46
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:55,251
[SPEAKER_04]: And so does Loki over here, who owns three copies of it.

47
00:02:56,192 --> 00:02:57,513
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm thinking of selling two of them.

48
00:02:58,314 --> 00:02:58,734
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me one.

49
00:02:59,415 --> 00:02:59,955
[SPEAKER_02]: No!

50
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:00,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppies!

51
00:03:01,576 --> 00:03:02,397
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Nintendogs.

52
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:03,461
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I didn't tell those.

53
00:03:03,481 --> 00:03:03,742
[SPEAKER_04]: Puppies!

54
00:03:05,063 --> 00:03:10,527
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing with my puppies, and then I got World of Warcraft and installed it today.

55
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:11,548
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally!

56
00:03:11,628 --> 00:03:14,350
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a year later, one of us gets sucked into World of Warcraft.

57
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:16,011
[SPEAKER_04]: Not quite sucked in.

58
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:17,212
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sort of pissed off.

59
00:03:17,292 --> 00:03:20,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually really livid for the lack of controller option.

60
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:25,378
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can play on the keyboard, but the controller is so much more efficient.

61
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:29,441
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially since I got used to playing that way on that game that sucks.

62
00:03:31,103 --> 00:03:32,704
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the game I still play, thank you very much.

63
00:03:33,809 --> 00:03:34,530
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my opinion on it.

64
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:56,634
[SPEAKER_04]: WarpGH.

65
00:03:56,654 --> 00:03:57,915
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thanks.

66
00:03:58,055 --> 00:03:58,415
[SPEAKER_04]: Bye.

67
00:03:58,675 --> 00:04:00,395
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck you.

68
00:04:00,455 --> 00:04:02,676
[SPEAKER_04]: For the people who say, warp me to here, warp me to here.

69
00:04:02,996 --> 00:04:05,876
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted a priest with only the gas time warp.

70
00:04:06,757 --> 00:04:11,238
[SPEAKER_04]: So that if they say, warp me to Christmas place.

71
00:04:11,278 --> 00:04:15,059
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, 5% of our audience has probably ever played Ragnarok and guessed that.

72
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:15,879
[SPEAKER_04]: Warp me to Ludi.

73
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:18,679
[SPEAKER_04]: Gas time's like the haunted place where big horrible things kill you.

74
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,280
[SPEAKER_04]: I was level 70-something and I still couldn't beat everything there.

75
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:24,661
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyway...

76
00:04:26,727 --> 00:04:27,387
[SPEAKER_04]: I played that.

77
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,948
[SPEAKER_04]: I played actually a few online games.

78
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,649
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing something on gorillas.com.

79
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,191
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been playing Frogas.

80
00:04:37,352 --> 00:04:37,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.

81
00:04:38,013 --> 00:04:41,294
[SPEAKER_04]: There's things you can do on the site and collect items and do certain things.

82
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:45,876
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things is you collect this potion that you go up to Noodle's room and insert into Sean Ryder's head.

83
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:47,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

84
00:04:47,337 --> 00:04:49,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And to get the last potion, you have to play Frogger.

85
00:04:49,992 --> 00:04:52,133
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's like you go there, get the potion, and come back.

86
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:53,614
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like horrible.

87
00:04:53,734 --> 00:04:54,554
[SPEAKER_01]: Silly flash games.

88
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:55,835
[SPEAKER_04]: Silly flash games, yeah.

89
00:04:55,855 --> 00:04:56,455
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of fun.

90
00:04:57,595 --> 00:05:02,758
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan also picked up Nightshade and Ico because they got really cheap and he gets a discount in the store.

91
00:05:03,318 --> 00:05:07,160
[SPEAKER_04]: And he picked up whatever that Burnout game is on PSP and has been playing it religiously.

92
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:11,221
[SPEAKER_01]: Burnout Legends, as I'm sure Loki will talk about a little bit earlier.

93
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:18,605
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, the more I hear Burnout, the more pissed off I get because I was trying to do my fucking illustrator homework on Saturday night.

94
00:05:18,665 --> 00:05:18,925
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh-huh.

95
00:05:19,885 --> 00:05:21,948
[SPEAKER_04]: and not Saturday night, I'm sorry, on Friday night.

96
00:05:22,428 --> 00:05:28,436
[SPEAKER_04]: And he comes in, him and his buddy playing Burnout as loud as our 50-inch widescreen TV would go.

97
00:05:29,677 --> 00:05:31,900
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was PMS and hardcore that night.

98
00:05:33,001 --> 00:05:36,265
[SPEAKER_04]: I went out there, let him have it, ate a bunch of chocolate and went to bed.

99
00:05:37,992 --> 00:05:38,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

100
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,154
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now that game is on my shit list.

101
00:05:41,234 --> 00:05:47,239
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I was going to recommend for World of Warcraft, check out some of the communities out there because I bet you somebody's got a mod out there.

102
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,720
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be the only one who desires to play controllers.

103
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:51,622
[SPEAKER_01]: There's got to be something going on out there, so check it out.

104
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:55,264
[SPEAKER_02]: You can mod pretty much everything in World of Warcraft using Lua.

105
00:05:55,284 --> 00:05:55,344
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

106
00:05:58,517 --> 00:05:59,237
[SPEAKER_02]: All the interfaces.

107
00:05:59,438 --> 00:06:11,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone actually created an auction interface where it will tell you what the item that you're trying to sell is going for, what the previous history is, and what they think that you can get for it and that type of stuff.

108
00:06:11,603 --> 00:06:12,203
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty cool.

109
00:06:12,924 --> 00:06:13,284
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds cool.

110
00:06:13,844 --> 00:06:15,105
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, Loki, what have you been playing this week?

111
00:06:15,565 --> 00:06:17,126
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been playing Burnout Revenge.

112
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,647
[SPEAKER_02]: And that game is awesome.

113
00:06:21,268 --> 00:06:25,029
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing we did, started playing Traffic Attack because there's nothing like driving 209 miles an hour

114
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:36,172
[SPEAKER_02]: and smashing into every single car in the world on this, you know, freaking track and just having them fly over you like a wake of water.

115
00:06:36,272 --> 00:06:37,693
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, it's great.

116
00:06:37,874 --> 00:06:39,154
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the most fun ever.

117
00:06:39,495 --> 00:06:45,599
[SPEAKER_02]: And the takedown mode, when you're playing that, you can actually use the crash breaker, which makes your car explode.

118
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:48,041
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really fun as well.

119
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,944
[SPEAKER_02]: The only complaint I have about it is the new way that they're doing the crash mode.

120
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:54,485
[SPEAKER_02]: They have this kind of, it's almost like

121
00:06:55,026 --> 00:06:57,249
[SPEAKER_02]: Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games Golf Games

122
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:18,094
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really strange how they've done that, and I didn't quite get it at first, so I made my car explode or stall and stuff like that.

123
00:07:18,734 --> 00:07:20,415
[SPEAKER_02]: But other than that, it's pretty cool.

124
00:07:21,996 --> 00:07:25,178
[SPEAKER_02]: I just can't wait to unlock more cars, because it's been pretty tough to do that.

125
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:29,820
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Burnout Legends, I've been playing that for the PSP, and that game's fun.

126
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:38,726
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing that sucks about that game is that game forces you to play with other people, because in order to unlock all the cars, there's six cars that are...

127
00:07:39,773 --> 00:07:44,197
[SPEAKER_02]: for each game, and you have to actually go play other people with those cars.

128
00:07:44,517 --> 00:07:46,739
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like Nintendogs, is what they're doing with it.

129
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,201
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's pretty much it.

130
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:49,982
[SPEAKER_02]: Just racing games.

131
00:07:50,082 --> 00:07:51,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Just burnout, burnout, burnout, all week long.

132
00:07:52,304 --> 00:07:56,107
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm going to try to pick... I have Urban Rain.

133
00:07:56,407 --> 00:07:57,388
[SPEAKER_02]: I should try to play that.

134
00:07:57,468 --> 00:08:01,151
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a fighting game, but beat-em-up game at the same time.

135
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:01,992
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Tekken.

136
00:08:03,313 --> 00:08:06,095
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually has Paul Phoenix and Law in it.

137
00:08:06,758 --> 00:08:07,178
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

138
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,339
[SPEAKER_02]: From the Tekken series.

139
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:14,423
[SPEAKER_02]: Which, had I known that when I was selling it, I probably would have sold it a bit better, but oh well.

140
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:17,835
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's see.

141
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:18,856
[SPEAKER_01]: What have I been playing this week?

142
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:22,738
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a seven-hour marathon of Final Fantasy XI this weekend.

143
00:08:22,798 --> 00:08:26,821
[SPEAKER_01]: Never again will I play an MMO for that long.

144
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:30,724
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was one of those things where it was like there was a mission and we all wanted to get it done.

145
00:08:30,764 --> 00:08:32,205
[SPEAKER_01]: And on top of that, I'd already been leveling.

146
00:08:32,245 --> 00:08:35,928
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like I really had a lazy Saturday in every essence of the word.

147
00:08:36,168 --> 00:08:39,110
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm sure some MMO addicts out there, they're cheering me on right now.

148
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,252
[SPEAKER_01]: But my God, that was just too much MMO for me on Saturday.

149
00:08:42,728 --> 00:08:45,410
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't played Final Fantasy XI for a long time.

150
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:47,791
[SPEAKER_02]: I have enough PTO where I can take a couple days off.

151
00:08:53,374 --> 00:08:54,014
[SPEAKER_01]: What else did I play?

152
00:08:54,515 --> 00:08:55,975
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to check out a couple new games.

153
00:08:56,016 --> 00:08:58,337
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually went out and bought a copy of Mortal Kombat Shaolin Monks.

154
00:08:58,797 --> 00:08:59,578
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

155
00:09:21,414 --> 00:09:21,934
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

156
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:40,843
[SPEAKER_01]: Deception Deception Deception Deception

157
00:09:54,139 --> 00:09:55,480
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

158
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:18,039
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember when they tried to do that, was it that side-scrolling RPG type game with Sub-Zero in it?

159
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:18,500
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awful.

160
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,481
[SPEAKER_01]: The Mythologies games were awful.

161
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:23,403
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but this one is surprisingly pretty fun.

162
00:10:23,544 --> 00:10:24,084
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really good.

163
00:10:24,604 --> 00:10:26,686
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty action-based.

164
00:10:27,427 --> 00:10:31,250
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, the best comparison I can think of is the Ninja Turtles arcade game, except it's...

165
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:36,597
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Mortal Kombat characters and you're just beating people up left and right and you can do all these fancy combos.

166
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:40,482
[SPEAKER_01]: And as you gain experience, you can purchase new combos and new things.

167
00:10:41,303 --> 00:10:42,424
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's actually a lot of fun.

168
00:10:42,925 --> 00:10:48,653
[SPEAKER_01]: My only minor complaints with Shaolin Monks is that there's just some real basic...

169
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:53,383
[SPEAKER_01]: Gameplay mechanic things that don't work for me, such as the fatalities.

170
00:10:53,743 --> 00:11:09,154
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the fatalities are kind of fun and it's kind of cute they put them in there, but unfortunately you only get one fatality in the beginning and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've been playing the game for a couple hours now and I just got like a new fatality called a multi-ality or something like that.

171
00:11:09,474 --> 00:11:12,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they're supposed to be looking in the list of blank fatalities, like 20 different things you can do.

172
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:15,076
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess I haven't found any yet.

173
00:11:15,116 --> 00:11:16,617
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I'm supposed to find them myself.

174
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:17,217
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

175
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:21,500
[SPEAKER_01]: But I get kind of bored with the fatality thing because I'm doing the same thing over and over.

176
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Slice, slice, slice, you know, with the hat because I'm playing as Kung Lao right now.

177
00:11:25,282 --> 00:11:26,683
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm doing the hat slice in half.

178
00:11:27,043 --> 00:11:30,485
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's cute at first and really funny and, you know, graphically well done.

179
00:11:30,845 --> 00:11:31,926
[SPEAKER_01]: But it gets old.

180
00:11:32,246 --> 00:11:39,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if the fatality combo meter filled maybe like half as fast, see, the fatality thing you only did half as often, I think it would have been better.

181
00:11:39,551 --> 00:11:41,672
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like the fatality thing gets really repetitive.

182
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:42,412
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

183
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:07,644
[SPEAKER_01]: and so I kind of wish that at some point the enemies went away and left you alone for a little while so you could kind of figure out, okay, where do I go next?

184
00:12:07,985 --> 00:12:09,125
[SPEAKER_01]: And then new enemies come out.

185
00:12:09,226 --> 00:12:10,687
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kind of got a little monotonous there.

186
00:12:11,367 --> 00:12:14,369
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my only other complaint would be the lack of save points.

187
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:18,632
[SPEAKER_01]: I can literally go 45 minutes in the game and not find a single save point.

188
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:22,055
[SPEAKER_01]: So there really needed to be about twice as many save points as there are.

189
00:12:22,115 --> 00:12:23,256
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a little bit frustrating.

190
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:27,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, though, those are just, you know, really in the grand scope of things, some minor complaints.

191
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:29,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the game is a heck of a lot of fun.

192
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,541
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a fan of Mortal Kombat...

193
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:37,367
[SPEAKER_01]: in any way, you're going to like this game because it really gets into the story better so than any of the movies ever did.

194
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It really gets into the story and it does a great job.

195
00:12:40,168 --> 00:12:42,049
[SPEAKER_03]: Movies?

196
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,030
[SPEAKER_03]: There was only one movie.

197
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:43,650
[SPEAKER_01]: There was two.

198
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,331
[SPEAKER_01]: There was only one movie.

199
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,533
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're denying the existence of it, but believe it or not, there was a second movie.

200
00:12:49,033 --> 00:12:51,294
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an hour and a half of my life I want back.

201
00:12:51,454 --> 00:12:54,536
[SPEAKER_01]: It was so good that they actually made a TV series too.

202
00:12:54,556 --> 00:12:55,076
[SPEAKER_01]: That's

203
00:12:55,469 --> 00:12:56,190
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right, huh?

204
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:56,750
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, God.

205
00:12:56,910 --> 00:13:00,694
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, just to put it in perspective, just how cool this game can be sometimes.

206
00:13:01,054 --> 00:13:08,120
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I was playing this one level, the last level I was on, I was fighting Katana, Jade, and Mileena all at once, like this level.

207
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,745
[SPEAKER_01]: And suddenly Katana, I don't want to spoil the story, but something happens where Katana's taken out of the picture, basically.

208
00:13:14,205 --> 00:13:42,945
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's just Jade and Mileena and you can like throw them into these traps and then hit this switch and it goes into the test your might mode from like Mortal Kombat 1 where you have to really slam all the buttons they kind of overdo that a little bit in the game but it's still really cute that they brought back test your might and like if you do the test your might thing then you'll like set a fire trap so you can set Mileena on fire a little bit just cute little things like that I can't believe I called it cute but seriously like little things like that Mortal Kombat's so cute it's not cute anymore there's no babalities

209
00:13:44,283 --> 00:13:44,923
[SPEAKER_01]: or Animalities.

210
00:13:45,043 --> 00:13:46,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Friendship!

211
00:13:47,884 --> 00:13:50,685
[SPEAKER_01]: So Mortal Kombat, I recommend it to fans of the Mortal Kombat series.

212
00:13:51,445 --> 00:13:54,826
[SPEAKER_01]: And just if you like those action fighting style games, you'll probably get a kick out of this.

213
00:13:54,926 --> 00:13:57,506
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it doesn't sound like your kind of game, you're probably not going to like it.

214
00:13:57,586 --> 00:13:58,547
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what else?

215
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,247
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that did get released earlier.

216
00:14:00,287 --> 00:14:02,388
[SPEAKER_02]: It was scheduled originally for the 21st.

217
00:14:03,368 --> 00:14:05,528
[SPEAKER_02]: They've got another fighting game coming out that looks pretty good.

218
00:14:05,769 --> 00:14:11,170
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually played a demo of it, Marvel Nemesis Rise of the Imperfects, which is a Marvel game they actually kind of

219
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,431
[SPEAKER_02]: and DarkSakura.com.

220
00:14:26,378 --> 00:14:29,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Really quick, the other game I played this week I want to give a real quick review to.

221
00:14:29,421 --> 00:14:39,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually got to play We Heart Katamari because as you might have heard on last week's show, Target, some of the Target stores acquired copies of the game and sold them early because the game's not actually out until this week.

222
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:41,711
[SPEAKER_01]: So We Heart Katamari is going to be on shelves this week.

223
00:14:42,052 --> 00:14:44,093
[SPEAKER_01]: I did get a chance to play it via one of my friends.

224
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,875
[SPEAKER_01]: I only got to play like the first two levels.

225
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:50,799
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm telling you what, kids, if you liked the first Katamari Damacy, you ain't going to be disappointed.

226
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:54,142
[SPEAKER_01]: The movies are just as quirky as they were the first time.

227
00:14:54,403 --> 00:15:00,529
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like the first game was so successful, they gave them a bigger budget to go through with the second game.

228
00:15:00,569 --> 00:15:03,232
[SPEAKER_01]: And you really see that they've kind of put more into this game.

229
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,877
[SPEAKER_01]: And just, you know, it's more the same, but at the same time,

230
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:09,535
[SPEAKER_01]: It just works.

231
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:10,936
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how else to explain it.

232
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:11,656
[SPEAKER_01]: It just works.

233
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:13,357
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were a fan of the first game, you're going to like this game.

234
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:16,999
[SPEAKER_01]: If you weren't a fan of the first game, I don't think there's anything new here that's going to win you over.

235
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,880
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you haven't played the Katamari Damacy game, check this out.

236
00:15:21,241 --> 00:15:22,821
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just such a quirky little title.

237
00:15:23,822 --> 00:15:26,103
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you guys will get a kick out of it.

238
00:15:26,223 --> 00:15:30,625
[SPEAKER_01]: The music, not quite as solid as the first game, but the music's a lot of fun too.

239
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:34,947
[SPEAKER_01]: And the script, the writing is just as hilarious as it was in the first game.

240
00:15:35,187 --> 00:15:35,527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.

241
00:15:36,987 --> 00:15:38,108
[SPEAKER_01]: Katamari fans won't be disappointed.

242
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:39,671
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

243
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:00,334
[SPEAKER_01]: What is this?

244
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:06,360
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nintendo nunchucks or something where you've got like the one little piece with the analog stick and then a remote control?

245
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,021
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up with this?

246
00:16:07,061 --> 00:16:07,841
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you guys think of this?

247
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:10,224
[SPEAKER_01]: You can check the pictures out on our website, orangelawnradio.com.

248
00:16:11,225 --> 00:16:12,867
[SPEAKER_04]: This technically goes into another segment.

249
00:16:12,887 --> 00:16:18,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, one of our listeners emailed us, Brittany, who basically agreed with me.

250
00:16:18,552 --> 00:16:20,835
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like using a big freaking remote control.

251
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:32,414
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Nintendo says, and I think part of the reason they're doing this is that they want to kind of lure in people that are a little scared of, you know, when they see like a gaming controller, they think, oh, it's a

252
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,908
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gaming thing, and I'm not really hip on this.

253
00:16:34,948 --> 00:16:38,789
[SPEAKER_01]: So, like, by making a remote control device, you know, everybody uses a remote control.

254
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:44,992
[SPEAKER_04]: They tried this before, sort of, with a system called the Fairchild Channel app.

255
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:45,692
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.

256
00:16:46,192 --> 00:16:50,394
[SPEAKER_04]: With a little, tiny little controller to tap in the little old stick that you hold.

257
00:16:50,474 --> 00:16:52,475
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a little different, but that controller sucked.

258
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:54,115
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole system sucked, honestly.

259
00:16:54,176 --> 00:16:55,776
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you think the revolution's gonna suck?

260
00:16:56,076 --> 00:16:56,636
[SPEAKER_01]: This controller?

261
00:16:56,937 --> 00:16:59,178
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, the one thing that I say about a system...

262
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,280
[SPEAKER_04]: A system is only as good as the games that are on it.

263
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:03,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.

264
00:17:04,201 --> 00:17:06,764
[SPEAKER_04]: But part of the game is how it's controlled.

265
00:17:07,344 --> 00:17:10,447
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a major part of the gameplay, right there, is how you're controlling it.

266
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:12,428
[SPEAKER_04]: This thing looks uncomfortable.

267
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,232
[SPEAKER_04]: Lately, my whole big thing has been ergonomics.

268
00:17:17,032 --> 00:17:23,038
[SPEAKER_04]: And like I said on our three-hour show, this one looks highly uncomfortable.

269
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:25,340
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be holding your wrist...

270
00:17:26,269 --> 00:17:30,831
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, take your hand, hold it straight up, turn your wrist sideways and do like you're holding a remote control.

271
00:17:31,471 --> 00:17:38,854
[SPEAKER_04]: Now imagine holding your hand in this position for an hour, two hours, however long you plan on playing a game.

272
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:42,075
[SPEAKER_04]: Now do you think that that's a natural position for your hand to be in?

273
00:17:43,684 --> 00:17:45,785
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine the stress you're putting your joints under.

274
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,427
[SPEAKER_04]: Now imagine if you are an older gamer.

275
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:50,768
[SPEAKER_04]: You work at, say, a desk job on a computer.

276
00:17:51,549 --> 00:17:53,510
[SPEAKER_04]: You're already putting your arm through stress that way.

277
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:57,993
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine the stress you're putting it through with this system that's supposed to help you relax, have some fun.

278
00:17:58,713 --> 00:17:59,474
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be hurting.

279
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:04,097
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to cause, you know, true medical issues.

280
00:18:04,497 --> 00:18:06,938
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think, though, that this will come out in the testing process?

281
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:12,502
[SPEAKER_01]: For instance, something I had brought up on our three-hour program when we were talking about this, the three-hour show, Sunday nights on OrangeOnlineRadio.com,

282
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:25,889
[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about this controller issue a little bit, and I mentioned that the DS at E3, the year that the DS came out, it changed from E3 to when it actually came out, and you said it's a little more comfortable than it was at E3.

283
00:18:26,169 --> 00:18:32,492
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that maybe after they test this a little bit, if they find these type of ergonomic issues with their testers, they might change this a little bit?

284
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:39,435
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it, I don't know how they can drastically, without making drastic changes to the controller, make it a little more ergonomic, but maybe just the way the games play?

285
00:18:39,895 --> 00:18:40,495
[SPEAKER_04]: One would hope so.

286
00:18:41,156 --> 00:18:41,916
[SPEAKER_04]: One would really hope so.

287
00:18:42,256 --> 00:18:42,617
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll see.

288
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,159
[SPEAKER_01]: But don't knock it until you've tried it, right?

289
00:18:44,419 --> 00:18:44,619
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

290
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:45,160
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.

291
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:51,188
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'll give it a fair go, but honestly, I'll get that little wave bird looking thingy that Loki posted about.

292
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:52,009
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, what was that, Loki?

293
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:53,832
[SPEAKER_01]: You posted like a mock-up on our website.

294
00:18:53,872 --> 00:18:55,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Was this a real deal picture or a mock-up?

295
00:18:55,414 --> 00:18:58,938
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of our feedback is a mock-up of a wave bird controller.

296
00:18:58,999 --> 00:18:59,720
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that they...

297
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:04,522
[SPEAKER_02]: Was it the president of Nintendo's development or something like that?

298
00:19:04,883 --> 00:19:07,144
[SPEAKER_02]: They were talking about how they were going to be adding that.

299
00:19:07,544 --> 00:19:10,846
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just they're going to have a ton of attachments, which means more stuff you've got to buy.

300
00:19:10,866 --> 00:19:12,987
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.

301
00:19:13,047 --> 00:19:15,909
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not saying that the other systems aren't doing that either, Microsoft.

302
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:18,570
[SPEAKER_02]: And it looks good.

303
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,231
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it'll work really well, actually.

304
00:19:20,471 --> 00:19:22,352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it's going to be a problem at all.

305
00:19:22,432 --> 00:19:24,353
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you hold controllers in your hand.

306
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:27,915
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see, you know.

307
00:19:27,995 --> 00:19:28,776
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just like a remote.

308
00:19:29,702 --> 00:19:33,985
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if it's light enough, it's not going to be a problem.

309
00:19:34,105 --> 00:19:36,166
[SPEAKER_03]: I find remote controls uncomfortable.

310
00:19:36,327 --> 00:19:43,351
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I like about it, though, is that you can take that remote control, turn it 90 degrees, and you've basically got an old-style NES controller.

311
00:19:43,431 --> 00:19:44,192
[SPEAKER_01]: And that would be cool.

312
00:19:44,292 --> 00:19:45,112
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.

313
00:19:45,313 --> 00:19:49,636
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be more comfortable, but I'm thinking, though, the intended way, like a remote control.

314
00:19:49,836 --> 00:19:50,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

315
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:55,279
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know this from experience, because I played Space Ace on my DVD player.

316
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:55,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

317
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,421
[SPEAKER_04]: And I hurt by the time I was done.

318
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:57,721
[SPEAKER_05]: Mm-hmm.

319
00:19:58,772 --> 00:20:01,756
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how this is going to feel and it's not natural.

320
00:20:02,236 --> 00:20:05,320
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think maybe we're being misled by these pictures a little bit that are showing it?

321
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:11,608
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this won't be the way it actually plays because I can't see how with your thumb you'd be able to hit that control pad and the button.

322
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,010
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen the video of this?

323
00:20:13,858 --> 00:20:14,799
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't have time to download it.

324
00:20:14,819 --> 00:20:16,960
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you guys seen the video from Tokyo Game Show?

325
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:17,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Describe it for us.

326
00:20:17,821 --> 00:20:28,269
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, for example, the way it was shown, this is the video they showed everybody when they were unveiling it, is it actually looks like it's from the view that you're in the TV.

327
00:20:28,349 --> 00:20:28,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

328
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:44,141
[SPEAKER_02]: and basically you're using that as you're not using the buttons on the controller the controller itself because it acts like a 3D mouse is what you're using so for example some of the things that they're showing you could say this might be the next WarioWare game

329
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:50,604
[SPEAKER_02]: A guy was chopping using the controller, acting like a knife, and frying stuff with like a knife.

330
00:20:51,324 --> 00:20:56,847
[SPEAKER_01]: I had heard, now I had read that there was a video out there, the Metroid Prime 2 Echo is being kind of played on this.

331
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:57,888
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they said it.

332
00:20:57,928 --> 00:21:01,990
[SPEAKER_01]: As moving around using the Bluetooth or whatever it is that's in there that senses where you are.

333
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,431
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the way it works is there's two sensors you put on your TV.

334
00:21:05,411 --> 00:21:09,354
[SPEAKER_02]: and it basically figures out, it triangulates where your controller is going to be.

335
00:21:09,374 --> 00:21:11,656
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of similar to the Power Glove that came out.

336
00:21:12,097 --> 00:21:20,384
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the other things that they showed with this is playing tennis, you know, like, you know, you would be just like racket fishing.

337
00:21:21,325 --> 00:21:23,487
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

338
00:21:47,404 --> 00:21:48,684
[SPEAKER_02]: And there you go, you're shooting something.

339
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,625
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you want to switch your weapon, you know, hit the button on top there.

340
00:21:51,985 --> 00:21:55,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus, the analog has two buttons on it as well, two trigger buttons.

341
00:21:55,906 --> 00:21:58,067
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I think it's going to work.

342
00:21:58,407 --> 00:22:05,889
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, really, there's no way it can't work, because if a game calls for something else, they'll build another add-on for it.

343
00:22:06,149 --> 00:22:07,009
[SPEAKER_01]: As they always do.

344
00:22:08,209 --> 00:22:09,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it'll be interesting to see what happens.

345
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,271
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure we'll see more and more of this leading up to next year's E3, which I'm sure will be a big, big unveil.

346
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:15,351
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the other thing, too.

347
00:22:16,167 --> 00:22:16,667
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.com

348
00:22:35,036 --> 00:22:35,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Check that out.

349
00:22:35,637 --> 00:22:35,957
[SPEAKER_01]: Answer it.

350
00:22:36,037 --> 00:22:38,298
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of the Nintendo Revolution controller?

351
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:41,320
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the real question is, what color Nintendo Revolution are you going to buy?

352
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:42,261
[SPEAKER_02]: The green one.

353
00:22:42,601 --> 00:22:47,785
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they have the green, red, the gray, the chrome, white, and black.

354
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,386
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have the red.

355
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:50,799
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

356
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:54,260
[SPEAKER_01]: Also on our main page, we definitely want to take a minute to recognize this.

357
00:22:54,680 --> 00:23:00,902
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a banner right there for a fundraiser effort we're doing for Hurricane Katrina relief.

358
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:01,662
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just us.

359
00:23:01,702 --> 00:23:07,344
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing it together with some other companies in Sacramento, Dark Records and Club 21 slash Rapture.

360
00:23:08,064 --> 00:23:09,965
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina.

361
00:23:10,225 --> 00:23:11,506
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching!

362
00:23:29,865 --> 00:23:54,237
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're in the Sacramento area where our show is based there's a lot you can do to help out with this because you can actually donate at Club 21 on Thursday nights even if you're anywhere in the world we are taking financial donations and if you'd like it to be specifically for to be forwarded to the SPCA for pet relief note that and we'll collect all that money together and send it on behalf of Orange Lounge Radio so check that out

363
00:23:55,757 --> 00:24:00,822
[SPEAKER_04]: We did mention that we are working with Dark Records and Club 21.

364
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:06,127
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, moving on into some gaming news tonight.

365
00:24:06,227 --> 00:24:09,510
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously a lot of news coming from the Tokyo Game Show.

366
00:24:09,931 --> 00:24:13,634
[SPEAKER_01]: Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots is the title.

367
00:24:14,175 --> 00:24:17,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight minute long preview for this game.

368
00:24:17,638 --> 00:24:18,419
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you check it out?

369
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:18,959
[SPEAKER_01]: I checked it out.

370
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,400
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you think?

371
00:24:20,023 --> 00:24:21,104
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.

372
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Snake is quite old.

373
00:24:22,745 --> 00:24:24,405
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it's going to be like a future thing now.

374
00:24:24,586 --> 00:24:24,806
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

375
00:24:24,986 --> 00:24:29,928
[SPEAKER_04]: No, you know what I thought was the coolest thing was the little mini Metal Gear with Otakon on it that they took right out of Policenauts.

376
00:24:30,609 --> 00:24:31,409
[SPEAKER_04]: That was freaking cool.

377
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,110
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty cool.

378
00:24:33,811 --> 00:24:35,792
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's definitely something to look forward to.

379
00:24:35,832 --> 00:24:37,993
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure a lot of fans are looking forward to the Metal Gear.

380
00:24:38,293 --> 00:24:39,074
[SPEAKER_02]: I was reading, too.

381
00:24:39,154 --> 00:24:41,435
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were thinking, oh, it's pre-rendered.

382
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:43,476
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's crap.

383
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:46,598
[SPEAKER_02]: They were saying, though, that they actually... What was it?

384
00:24:46,638 --> 00:24:47,038
[SPEAKER_02]: Kojima...

385
00:24:47,754 --> 00:25:04,049
[SPEAKER_02]: They showed that the actual presentation was actually being rendered real time and they stopped it and panned around Snake as well to stop those disbelievers from posting crap about it.

386
00:25:05,788 --> 00:25:06,208
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

387
00:25:06,348 --> 00:25:06,748
[SPEAKER_01]: Looks good.

388
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:14,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of Kojima, he basically said that Metal Gear Solid 4 will be his last.

389
00:25:14,492 --> 00:25:17,334
[SPEAKER_01]: But I kind of think, didn't he say the same thing after Metal Gear Solid 3?

390
00:25:17,374 --> 00:25:18,934
[SPEAKER_01]: That he was going to do another one?

391
00:25:19,074 --> 00:25:20,655
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Hulk Hogan syndrome here.

392
00:25:21,175 --> 00:25:25,397
[SPEAKER_04]: The man keeps saying he's going to retire, but he always shows up at WrestleMania.

393
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:32,741
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he also, now Kojima also says that Yoji Shinkawa, who's the art director, will be leaving with him.

394
00:25:33,385 --> 00:25:34,406
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

395
00:25:49,805 --> 00:25:51,306
[SPEAKER_01]: Which also, by the way, was kind of a bad movie.

396
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,627
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but that wasn't really Metal Gear.

397
00:25:53,108 --> 00:25:54,589
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even think he acknowledges it.

398
00:25:54,849 --> 00:25:59,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there was actually a Metal Gear 2 on the MSX in Japan.

399
00:25:59,473 --> 00:26:05,158
[SPEAKER_01]: His direct quote was, I decided to make the real sequel to Metal Gear when he saw Snake's Revenge.

400
00:26:07,019 --> 00:26:07,359
[SPEAKER_01]: Ouch.

401
00:26:09,201 --> 00:26:18,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, also coming out of Tokyo Game Show, those of you music game fans are going to be very pleased to hear that Konami, after a long hiatus, is going to be putting out brand new Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania games.

402
00:26:18,749 --> 00:26:19,109
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

403
00:26:19,631 --> 00:26:24,155
[SPEAKER_01]: Gita Dora, as the series is sometimes referred to, is getting the V games released.

404
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:36,304
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't know quite yet if it's a combo game, but since we know that all the previous PlayStation 2 releases, which ended at Guitar Freak's fourth mix and Drum Mania's third mix, were combined together.

405
00:26:37,024 --> 00:26:42,648
[SPEAKER_01]: To put this into some perspective for you guys, Guitar Freak's V, I think is what, the 11th or 12th?

406
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:43,429
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost count.

407
00:26:43,469 --> 00:26:44,030
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's like the 12th?

408
00:26:44,830 --> 00:27:13,083
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that guitar freaks in the arcade and the last one we got on PS2 was 4 so there's a whole lot of ground to cover here with these new games that are coming out on the PS2 gonna come out in 2006 in Japan no word yet if the series will finally make a crossover into America but I think what might make or break that would be Konami if they watch the success of Guitar Hero which is what Red Octane and Harmonix are gonna be putting out pretty soon I believe before the end of the year

409
00:27:13,561 --> 00:27:24,262
[SPEAKER_01]: so it'll be interesting to see if that does very well then Konami might try to take back the market that they kind of created overseas interesting way it works out there they'll take notice

410
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:30,064
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, wanting to point out some Final Fantasy news from Tokyo Game Show.

411
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:32,706
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy XI will definitely be expanding.

412
00:27:33,466 --> 00:27:43,453
[SPEAKER_01]: Treasures of At-Organ was announced officially, the new expansion pack, to be released with the Xbox 360, assumably, version of Final Fantasy XI.

413
00:27:44,114 --> 00:27:51,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Some early preview videos are hinting that Blue Mage will be one of the new classes, because in the video you could see—and this is one of the videos I did download, of course—

414
00:27:52,179 --> 00:27:58,582
[SPEAKER_01]: You can actually see, I think it was a human was breathing fire in one of the videos and like a Taro was shooting spider web using one of the spider's attacks.

415
00:27:59,542 --> 00:28:01,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty neat looking artifact armor for Blue Mage 2.

416
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:04,724
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's another mystery kind of job class.

417
00:28:04,784 --> 00:28:07,265
[SPEAKER_01]: Not quite sure what it is, but it looks like there's another job class in there too.

418
00:28:07,685 --> 00:28:09,707
[SPEAKER_04]: All you have to do is look to Tactics for your ideas.

419
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep, look to Tactics for ideas.

420
00:28:12,510 --> 00:28:21,900
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought that Alchemist or Geomancer would be for sure, because I especially thought Geomancer with all the elemental focus and stuff, but it doesn't look like that's the new class.

421
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,381
[SPEAKER_04]: World of Warcraft has that.

422
00:28:23,662 --> 00:28:25,604
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, but... Blue Mage would be cool.

423
00:28:26,553 --> 00:28:53,157
[SPEAKER_01]: but you know there's gonna yeah everybody's gonna be a blue mage all right so we will see um we don't have any details as to when these games are coming out but we're thinking i'm thinking anyway probably early 2006 i would say it would be a good guesstimate also final fantasy related now jamie this has to be a final fantasy game that you like because if not you're just not human final fantasy 4 will be coming out for now you smiled there you like final fantasy 4 right

424
00:28:53,578 --> 00:28:55,559
[SPEAKER_04]: Final Fantasy 4 is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.

425
00:28:55,599 --> 00:29:00,222
[SPEAKER_01]: Final Fantasy 4 is being ported to the Game Boy Advance in Japan on December 12th.

426
00:29:00,242 --> 00:29:01,903
[SPEAKER_01]: It will include new areas and get this, new characters.

427
00:29:12,610 --> 00:29:12,770
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh-oh.

428
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:13,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be interesting.

429
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:16,791
[SPEAKER_01]: My gut reaction tells me, oh my gosh, Palamonporum.

430
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:19,372
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, we'll be able to be unstoned and rejoin your party.

431
00:29:19,832 --> 00:29:20,532
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be cool.

432
00:29:21,053 --> 00:29:25,034
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be the perfect, the biggest fan pleaser that Square could do.

433
00:29:25,454 --> 00:29:28,395
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's cheesy, but what a fan pleaser.

434
00:29:28,435 --> 00:29:30,115
[SPEAKER_01]: More Spoonie Bartness!

435
00:29:30,555 --> 00:29:31,136
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay!

436
00:29:31,376 --> 00:29:31,556
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.

437
00:29:31,816 --> 00:29:32,536
[SPEAKER_01]: So that should be cool.

438
00:29:33,836 --> 00:29:39,558
[SPEAKER_01]: No word yet if it's coming out in America, but Final Fantasy's pretty big here now, and they put out all the other...

439
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,056
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

440
00:29:52,294 --> 00:29:53,495
[SPEAKER_04]: I do indeedy.

441
00:29:53,735 --> 00:30:00,638
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, if you have letters, send it to our mailbag, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

442
00:30:00,658 --> 00:30:01,678
[SPEAKER_01]: We love getting your feedback.

443
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,159
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, who wrote us today?

444
00:30:03,419 --> 00:30:10,302
[SPEAKER_04]: Sasuke sent us an email, a question we've been asked many, many times, actually just very recently tonight, about how we got our name.

445
00:30:10,602 --> 00:30:18,166
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he was talking about Orange Lounge, you know, the group, doing Mobomoga, all the Bimani stuff.

446
00:30:18,906 --> 00:30:23,353
[SPEAKER_04]: We were sitting on the BART one day, saying, you know, damn it, we want to do an internet radio station.

447
00:30:23,373 --> 00:30:24,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is a train in the Bay Area, for those who don't know.

448
00:30:25,196 --> 00:30:26,858
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bay Area Rapid Transit.

449
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:34,129
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just came up with the name, because our three-hour show was Bibani-related, and that's how we started off.

450
00:30:34,429 --> 00:30:35,330
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for watching.

451
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,510
[SPEAKER_01]: See you next time.

452
00:30:50,097 --> 00:30:55,879
[SPEAKER_01]: So Orange Lounge was just kind of like, you know, you like something, you name yourself after something related to it.

453
00:30:55,959 --> 00:31:03,902
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought lounge because we kind of lounge around and have that whole Denny's vibe of just sitting around coffee and just talking about random stuff.

454
00:31:03,942 --> 00:31:04,702
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what we do.

455
00:31:04,842 --> 00:31:06,803
[SPEAKER_01]: So Orange Lounge just seemed appropriate.

456
00:31:08,002 --> 00:31:11,847
[SPEAKER_04]: Got an email from one of our long-time listeners, Asian Buddy Paul.

457
00:31:12,027 --> 00:31:12,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

458
00:31:13,049 --> 00:31:16,213
[SPEAKER_04]: Said, I'd just like to say how much I love the podcast.

459
00:31:16,273 --> 00:31:19,697
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to listen to the live show Sundays, but I can't catch them anymore.

460
00:31:19,817 --> 00:31:20,158
[SPEAKER_04]: Tear.

461
00:31:20,598 --> 00:31:21,159
[SPEAKER_04]: So I love it.

462
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:22,541
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.

463
00:31:23,602 --> 00:31:29,770
[SPEAKER_04]: And he just got married on his Ragnarok online private server, so congratulations, I think.

464
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:31,572
[SPEAKER_01]: No, nerd.

465
00:31:31,992 --> 00:31:32,974
[SPEAKER_01]: You nerd.

466
00:31:33,695 --> 00:31:35,777
[SPEAKER_01]: You got married in an online game, you nerd.

467
00:31:35,998 --> 00:31:39,302
[SPEAKER_04]: He was wanting us to play one of our cage match winning songs.

468
00:31:40,359 --> 00:31:44,421
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the Cage Match we do as part of the three-hour show when we play random music.

469
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:48,502
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd actually answered back saying, you know, sort of separate this, that, and the other.

470
00:31:48,522 --> 00:31:56,125
[SPEAKER_01]: You run into all those licensing problems because our live station is run through Live 365, which pays a lot of licensing fees up front.

471
00:31:56,786 --> 00:32:01,388
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to podcasts, can you play copyrighted music in podcasts?

472
00:32:01,428 --> 00:32:04,529
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a big question mark right now because, you know, it's...

473
00:32:05,612 --> 00:32:07,472
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a gray area, so we don't do it on this.

474
00:32:36,309 --> 00:32:37,469
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw this link.

475
00:32:37,549 --> 00:32:38,249
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh.

476
00:32:38,309 --> 00:32:43,090
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is Dance Dance Revolution, except it's all Christian music.

477
00:32:43,110 --> 00:32:44,071
[SPEAKER_01]: DDR God version.

478
00:32:45,491 --> 00:32:49,232
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the, like they took a bunch of Christian music labels and put it together.

479
00:32:50,592 --> 00:32:52,352
[SPEAKER_01]: Made their own version of DDR.

480
00:32:52,372 --> 00:32:57,754
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, looking at this now, because for a moment I was thinking, oh, DDR, yay.

481
00:32:58,314 --> 00:32:59,834
[SPEAKER_04]: But it does reverse scrolling.

482
00:33:00,632 --> 00:33:06,156
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's kind of... Well, they have to change it a little bit, or they might get sued by Konami, just like, you know, the folks who made In the Groove got sued.

483
00:33:06,176 --> 00:33:09,418
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, it shows them freaking playing on Konami dance pads.

484
00:33:11,099 --> 00:33:12,881
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a damn Stepmania version.

485
00:33:12,921 --> 00:33:14,121
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Stepmania, is all it is.

486
00:33:14,141 --> 00:33:14,842
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Stepmania.

487
00:33:14,942 --> 00:33:15,422
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably.

488
00:33:15,642 --> 00:33:24,529
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game, I go for it, but I don't see this being the next big thing in dance games.

489
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,692
[SPEAKER_01]: I chalk this right up there with other classic...

490
00:33:30,828 --> 00:33:34,171
[SPEAKER_01]: Video games made for retail sales in Christian bookstores.

491
00:33:34,231 --> 00:33:36,433
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes me think of the Bible Trivia Game.

492
00:33:36,713 --> 00:33:38,495
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Bible Trivia Game and Noah's Ark.

493
00:33:38,575 --> 00:33:43,860
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the old DDR parody that had the cross-shaped controller that had the two down arrows?

494
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,121
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

495
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:49,845
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot what that was, but that was... Dance, Dance Resurrection.

496
00:33:51,486 --> 00:33:52,047
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, whatever.

497
00:33:52,227 --> 00:33:52,907
[SPEAKER_04]: That was horrible.

498
00:33:52,927 --> 00:33:54,189
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about another bad game?

499
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:56,911
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the Friends Trivia Game we've got to sell.

500
00:33:59,059 --> 00:34:01,322
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I saw that for sale somewhere.

501
00:34:01,342 --> 00:34:01,883
[SPEAKER_01]: I heard about it.

502
00:34:16,784 --> 00:34:17,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

503
00:34:17,405 --> 00:34:19,026
[SPEAKER_01]: Although she had nothing to do with friends.

504
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,308
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.

505
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:26,271
[SPEAKER_02]: Her character, not Fran Drescher, but the character in it.

506
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,593
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, the one who was the girlfriend?

507
00:34:28,793 --> 00:34:29,954
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I can't remember her name.

508
00:34:29,994 --> 00:34:30,755
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't watch the show.

509
00:34:31,215 --> 00:34:34,398
[SPEAKER_04]: The one who had the really annoying one.

510
00:34:34,418 --> 00:34:37,640
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god!

511
00:34:38,381 --> 00:34:40,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, our listeners are going to write hate mail for that.

512
00:34:40,522 --> 00:34:40,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

513
00:34:41,243 --> 00:34:43,404
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I gotta answer it, so I better not.

514
00:34:43,744 --> 00:34:58,189
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game, go for it, but I don't think the quality of the game, since, let's face it, it is being put out by a much, much, much, much, much smaller company, I don't think it's gonna be that smooth a game, but whatever.

515
00:34:58,989 --> 00:34:59,309
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun.

516
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:01,690
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other emails?

517
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:07,852
[SPEAKER_04]: Other than the one I mentioned about the controller, but we've addressed that.

518
00:35:07,912 --> 00:35:08,292
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool deal.

519
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:09,513
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well, send us more mail.

520
00:35:09,593 --> 00:35:10,273
[SPEAKER_01]: We like getting mail.

521
00:35:10,473 --> 00:35:10,793
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, Jamie?

522
00:35:11,878 --> 00:35:12,519
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we do.

523
00:35:12,879 --> 00:35:14,841
[SPEAKER_01]: Send Jamie some email about how much you love her giggling.

524
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:17,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Her incessant giggling on this program.

525
00:35:17,963 --> 00:35:20,285
[SPEAKER_04]: I am not a giggler.

526
00:35:21,146 --> 00:35:29,032
[SPEAKER_01]: To go at OrangeLoungeRadio.com I'm giggling now because I keep calling you a giggler.

527
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,934
[SPEAKER_04]: I did find something cool internet related though.

528
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:31,334
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, what's that?

529
00:35:31,354 --> 00:35:32,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a really short thing.

530
00:35:32,535 --> 00:35:38,440
[SPEAKER_04]: For folks like me who like to use Firefox, there's a skin for it called Pimpzilla.

531
00:35:39,395 --> 00:35:44,357
[SPEAKER_04]: that makes your top toolbar all fuzzy and then the background behind your tab is all leopard print.

532
00:35:44,377 --> 00:35:46,499
[SPEAKER_04]: I just thought that people... Where can they download that?

533
00:35:46,999 --> 00:35:48,239
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we put a link on our site somewhere?

534
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,140
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hunt it down again.

535
00:35:50,621 --> 00:35:55,623
[SPEAKER_04]: But the font and all the buttons and everything look like they're straight out of Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.

536
00:35:55,703 --> 00:35:56,383
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.

537
00:35:56,443 --> 00:35:56,744
[SPEAKER_04]: Cute.

538
00:35:57,044 --> 00:35:58,784
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all bling-shaped and everything.

539
00:35:58,845 --> 00:35:59,145
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cool.

540
00:35:59,345 --> 00:35:59,585
[SPEAKER_01]: Cute.

541
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:01,126
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

542
00:36:01,606 --> 00:36:03,727
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into some more gaming news.

543
00:36:04,407 --> 00:36:07,229
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing we mentioned earlier in the program was Katamari Damacy.

544
00:36:07,249 --> 00:36:07,609
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.

545
00:36:08,362 --> 00:36:09,823
[SPEAKER_01]: Boku no Watashi no Katamari Damashii

546
00:36:36,437 --> 00:36:38,918
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody told me it turns into My My Katamari Damacy.

547
00:36:39,058 --> 00:36:40,098
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.

548
00:36:40,118 --> 00:36:40,658
[SPEAKER_04]: Read the title again.

549
00:36:40,999 --> 00:36:43,659
[SPEAKER_01]: Boku no Watashi no Katamari Damacy.

550
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,060
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, My My Katamari.

551
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,460
[SPEAKER_01]: So, whatever.

552
00:36:47,221 --> 00:36:47,921
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

553
00:36:48,041 --> 00:36:49,601
[SPEAKER_04]: Boku no is like boy saying.

554
00:36:49,841 --> 00:36:51,242
[SPEAKER_04]: Atashi no is like girl saying.

555
00:36:51,582 --> 00:36:52,382
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, okay.

556
00:36:52,642 --> 00:36:55,963
[SPEAKER_04]: So it sounds like it's little boys and girls saying are Katamari.

557
00:36:56,284 --> 00:36:58,344
[SPEAKER_01]: Not a whole lot known about this game just yet.

558
00:36:58,524 --> 00:37:00,965
[SPEAKER_01]: Wi-Fi support, though, is rumored to be in it.

559
00:37:01,205 --> 00:37:03,226
[SPEAKER_01]: Branching storylines like night and day.

560
00:37:04,006 --> 00:37:06,007
[SPEAKER_01]: and other kind of modes like that are going to be in it.

561
00:37:06,027 --> 00:37:07,187
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be kind of cool to see.

562
00:37:08,107 --> 00:37:11,028
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's being shown at Tokyo Game Show.

563
00:37:11,088 --> 00:37:12,569
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear if it was playable or not.

564
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:13,589
[SPEAKER_01]: I just know it's being shown.

565
00:37:13,829 --> 00:37:14,129
[SPEAKER_02]: It was.

566
00:37:14,429 --> 00:37:14,989
[SPEAKER_01]: It was playable?

567
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:21,071
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's actually people saying that the controls sucked on it.

568
00:37:21,632 --> 00:37:22,832
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh no!

569
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:24,813
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it can't be that great.

570
00:37:24,833 --> 00:37:31,455
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you can't do dual analog, so what it is is it's the directional button and the four buttons are the two sticks.

571
00:37:31,495 --> 00:37:32,655
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew it would be like that.

572
00:37:33,132 --> 00:37:33,892
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of sucks.

573
00:37:33,932 --> 00:37:42,695
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the person that was looking at it was saying that they hoped that it would have been like the analog and turning with the shoulder buttons, which would be good.

574
00:37:43,875 --> 00:37:57,860
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, from what I remember on the plot for it, is that apparently there's some island that's in trouble that has animals on it or whatever, and you have to, you arrive there on a boat or something, and you have to save the animals or something by absorbing them.

575
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,880
[SPEAKER_01]: By rolling them over?

576
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:58,980
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

577
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,321
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess.

578
00:38:01,882 --> 00:38:02,382
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.

579
00:38:02,522 --> 00:38:07,245
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but that was what I had heard, and it was pretty interesting.

580
00:38:07,385 --> 00:38:09,166
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

581
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,488
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all for Katamari coming to the PSP.

582
00:38:12,327 --> 00:38:12,767
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

583
00:38:12,907 --> 00:38:13,207
[SPEAKER_01]: Hell yeah.

584
00:38:13,628 --> 00:38:18,950
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, one other PSP story I definitely want to make sure we cover at some point, also being shown at the Tokyo Game Show.

585
00:38:19,410 --> 00:38:24,012
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys know that Suikoden 1 and 2, there are an absolute bitch to find.

586
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:27,573
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you could be paying like $100 for a copy of Suikoden 2 on eBay.

587
00:38:27,953 --> 00:38:28,593
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

588
00:38:29,234 --> 00:38:35,116
[SPEAKER_01]: They are both coming out again, together on the PSP, this being announced at Tokyo Game Show.

589
00:38:35,436 --> 00:38:40,378
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Suikoden fans, if you've been dying to play Suikoden 2 for a while, you just can't seem to get a copy of it,

590
00:38:40,678 --> 00:38:43,781
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be coming out for the PSP along with Suikoden 1.

591
00:38:44,381 --> 00:38:45,342
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be pretty cool.

592
00:38:45,462 --> 00:38:49,965
[SPEAKER_01]: No estimated release on this, but probably not until next year at some point.

593
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:54,089
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is only Japan so far, but heck, why not?

594
00:38:54,169 --> 00:38:55,610
[SPEAKER_01]: Should come out over here too, right?

595
00:38:55,730 --> 00:38:57,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit of translation, right?

596
00:38:58,112 --> 00:38:58,452
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

597
00:38:59,693 --> 00:39:01,374
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, you got some gaming news for us?

598
00:39:01,474 --> 00:39:03,296
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, was something going on in the hack and crack scene?

599
00:39:03,516 --> 00:39:05,117
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a couple things actually.

600
00:39:05,457 --> 00:39:08,079
[SPEAKER_02]: The first being that the rumored...

601
00:39:09,386 --> 00:39:36,851
[SPEAKER_02]: Team Extender, they're actually creating this video out for the PSP so you can watch your UMDs and everything on normal TV and they had a demo of it what this thing does and it looks like it's a whole case replace of it, you basically unscrew the case and pop this sucker on it has actually a port to plug in a DualShock controller so you can use that as the controller and then play your games on the TV that way

602
00:39:37,133 --> 00:39:37,893
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?

603
00:39:38,233 --> 00:39:40,034
[SPEAKER_04]: And this was even just last night.

604
00:39:40,634 --> 00:39:45,875
[SPEAKER_04]: I had gone back after my trip to Ikea and stopped by to see Dan at GameStop.

605
00:39:45,955 --> 00:39:48,576
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was saying, they should make a TV tuner for the PSP.

606
00:39:48,856 --> 00:39:52,857
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, wasn't it rumored that PS3 was going to have a UMD slot in it?

607
00:39:53,537 --> 00:39:57,378
[SPEAKER_02]: That was sort of a rumor, but I don't think it's going to happen.

608
00:39:57,918 --> 00:39:59,499
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what everyone was speculating.

609
00:39:59,519 --> 00:39:59,699
[SPEAKER_02]: It should.

610
00:39:59,719 --> 00:40:00,079
[SPEAKER_01]: It should.

611
00:40:00,929 --> 00:40:02,210
[SPEAKER_02]: It would make sense, but no.

612
00:40:02,431 --> 00:40:07,956
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about it, though, especially with the success that they've been having with the movies, which is kind of odd to me.

613
00:40:07,996 --> 00:40:10,498
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I understand why they put movies on PSP, but I don't see why it's so successful.

614
00:40:10,538 --> 00:40:11,579
[SPEAKER_01]: It would make perfect sense.

615
00:40:11,859 --> 00:40:16,003
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then Sony could really compete with DVD, but they would have their own version.

616
00:40:16,966 --> 00:40:19,608
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would be very smart to put it in there.

617
00:40:19,788 --> 00:40:20,089
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

618
00:40:20,129 --> 00:40:30,297
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then they can have it, okay, you know, you can... If you buy this version of the movie, not only will you be able to play it on your TV, but you can also take it on the go with you.

619
00:40:31,958 --> 00:40:33,359
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be interesting.

620
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,921
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be smart, but I don't think you're going to do it.

621
00:40:36,454 --> 00:40:41,217
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, yeah, so this thing is actually being, um, I guess beta right now.

622
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:45,420
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working out the kinks in it, but, um, from the screenshots I've seen, it looks good.

623
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:50,904
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll have selectable, um, widescreen and pan and scan, you know, if you want to, like, fill your whole TV.

624
00:40:51,404 --> 00:40:52,725
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, it should be cool.

625
00:40:52,925 --> 00:40:53,966
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, um... Resolution issues?

626
00:40:54,987 --> 00:41:00,130
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think so, but, um, of course it'll stretch it if, you know, you try to take it out of widescreen.

627
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:03,653
[SPEAKER_02]: But, um, you know, hey, I'm all for modding my PSP, so...

628
00:41:04,663 --> 00:41:09,408
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm concerned about resolution when you get into larger high definition formats.

629
00:41:09,428 --> 00:41:11,089
[SPEAKER_01]: And how about support for widescreen TVs, huh?

630
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:12,331
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

631
00:41:12,351 --> 00:41:13,532
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying.

632
00:41:13,612 --> 00:41:14,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's what it is.

633
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:22,140
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, if you want to get to the nitty gritty of this, the PSP already has a video out on it.

634
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,461
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the USB.

635
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,485
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when you're playing your games, the USB acts like a video out.

636
00:41:28,703 --> 00:41:31,624
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're very interested in trying to make one, you probably could.

637
00:41:32,504 --> 00:41:35,585
[SPEAKER_02]: All this thing is, is just adding some more support.

638
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:39,447
[SPEAKER_02]: So, really, that USB port can be exploited to a lot.

639
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:43,768
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, so other than this... You said the term nitty-gritty.

640
00:41:45,509 --> 00:41:46,589
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, and I'm sorry.

641
00:41:46,649 --> 00:41:48,530
[SPEAKER_04]: I instantly started thinking nitty-gritty derpy.

642
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:56,032
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing, I was going to say, was it... This site, P6, who's doing this kind of a new...

643
00:41:57,170 --> 00:42:04,213
[SPEAKER_02]: No, Graphic User Interface for the PSP, which looks pretty sexy, but still working out the kinks on that.

644
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:13,797
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually have a tutorial here on how to, if you really want to mod your PSP, you can change all the menus what their titles are.

645
00:42:13,857 --> 00:42:18,739
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can make it UMD as in movie player, or you're

646
00:42:21,341 --> 00:42:24,502
[SPEAKER_02]: system settings as I fucked your mom or something like that.

647
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:31,164
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do whatever you want and there's a tutorial on their site and that's pretty interesting.

648
00:42:31,204 --> 00:42:36,566
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a link on PSP updates for that and on our site as well once we put it on there.

649
00:42:37,666 --> 00:42:39,507
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that's pretty much it.

650
00:42:39,547 --> 00:42:46,209
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really cool Tetris game that came out called Hack and you should check that out too.

651
00:42:46,229 --> 00:42:46,989
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty cool.

652
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:49,010
[SPEAKER_02]: The link we'll have on our page as well.

653
00:42:50,205 --> 00:42:53,887
[SPEAKER_02]: Dark Sakura, what kind of gaming news do you have for us tonight?

654
00:43:19,728 --> 00:43:20,809
[SPEAKER_04]: I've got a couple things.

655
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:23,631
[SPEAKER_04]: About Final Fantasy, actually.

656
00:43:23,691 --> 00:43:24,672
[SPEAKER_04]: Dirge of Aseribus.

657
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:25,332
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, cool.

658
00:43:26,273 --> 00:43:30,736
[SPEAKER_04]: Been trying to hunt down a release date, because I want my hot Vincent action.

659
00:43:31,857 --> 00:43:37,801
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's speculated the date tentative in Japan is sometime in 2005.

660
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,422
[SPEAKER_04]: No US release date yet.

661
00:43:39,842 --> 00:43:41,523
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means next summer.

662
00:43:41,904 --> 00:43:42,164
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.

663
00:43:43,118 --> 00:44:12,010
[SPEAKER_04]: but you know with every Final Fantasy game that's practically ever been out except for like what 4 when it came out we're going to get more stuff and they're going to release an international version and they're going to get more stuff and I'm going to have to import it and it's going to of course be in English so they better have someone hot do Vincent's voice anyway could you imagine great now I can't remember his name Boreanaz David Boreanaz doing Vincent's voice he's too busy doing Squall in Kingdom Hearts

664
00:44:12,972 --> 00:44:13,753
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

665
00:44:32,353 --> 00:44:36,637
[SPEAKER_04]: The Deep Ground Soldiers, who go underground after the meteor incident.

666
00:44:36,657 --> 00:44:37,959
[SPEAKER_04]: We all played Final Fantasy VII.

667
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:40,962
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a Sahagin, Gargoyle.

668
00:44:41,582 --> 00:44:42,623
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are some of the things.

669
00:44:42,923 --> 00:44:53,774
[SPEAKER_04]: And of course, looking at a movie file, which Loki was kind enough to show me, it looks like it's going to be an over-the-shoulder perspective, sort of first-person shootery-ish movie.

670
00:44:54,861 --> 00:45:00,308
[SPEAKER_04]: But it actually sort of made me think a little bit like it's like Devil May Cry featuring Vincent.

671
00:45:02,850 --> 00:45:04,312
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not a bad thing, no.

672
00:45:05,033 --> 00:45:08,557
[SPEAKER_04]: But there better not be any freaking Aerith in it or I'll scream.

673
00:45:08,577 --> 00:45:09,839
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate her.

674
00:45:11,239 --> 00:45:33,475
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, speaking about the Final Fantasy VII franchise, I was reading an interview from our friends at 1UP.com with Tetsuya Nomura, who's, as we know, the director of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, stating that he very much wants to...

675
00:45:35,196 --> 00:45:40,921
[SPEAKER_04]: and sort of expand on the Final Fantasy VII tech demo and completely remake the game.

676
00:45:41,421 --> 00:45:42,863
[SPEAKER_01]: I've said this on previous podcasts.

677
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:47,287
[SPEAKER_01]: I highly speculate it's already in the works and they're just keeping a real tight lid on it.

678
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:50,169
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a surprise at next year's E3.

679
00:45:50,509 --> 00:45:53,252
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know.

680
00:45:53,512 --> 00:45:54,173
[SPEAKER_01]: I might be wrong.

681
00:45:55,213 --> 00:45:55,654
[SPEAKER_01]: What can you do?

682
00:45:56,781 --> 00:46:02,442
[SPEAKER_04]: All we can do is wait, but I'll tell you, if it's out, I know which of those systems I'm getting first.

683
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:04,463
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all there is to that.

684
00:46:04,803 --> 00:46:06,243
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what else is coming out for the PS3?

685
00:46:06,883 --> 00:46:07,784
[SPEAKER_02]: Remake of Gradius.

686
00:46:09,444 --> 00:46:11,264
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I heard, I had a story queued up on that.

687
00:46:11,304 --> 00:46:11,885
[SPEAKER_01]: You ruined it.

688
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:12,145
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sorry.

689
00:46:12,165 --> 00:46:12,665
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

690
00:46:12,745 --> 00:46:15,986
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's a wonderful transition into your part.

691
00:46:16,926 --> 00:46:17,966
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though I have something else.

692
00:46:18,206 --> 00:46:18,626
[SPEAKER_01]: That's alright.

693
00:46:18,726 --> 00:46:19,726
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll get back to you here.

694
00:46:19,806 --> 00:46:21,067
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me get the story I have here.

695
00:46:21,107 --> 00:46:23,687
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll go cry in my little giggling ditzy corner.

696
00:46:24,027 --> 00:46:24,768
Gradius.

697
00:46:25,928 --> 00:46:26,348
Hee hee hee.

698
00:46:27,177 --> 00:46:33,081
[SPEAKER_01]: Gradius will be coming out on the PlayStation 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show.

699
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: There really isn't a whole lot else to say except Gradius is coming out in a brand new PlayStation 3 form.

700
00:46:39,785 --> 00:46:41,045
[SPEAKER_01]: What else is there to say?

701
00:46:41,305 --> 00:46:42,006
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Gradius.

702
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:42,946
[SPEAKER_01]: It's PlayStation 3.

703
00:46:43,567 --> 00:46:44,888
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be very sexy.

704
00:46:46,068 --> 00:46:52,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially if some of the famous Konami musicians such as Akira Yamaoka or some of the other people they have there are doing the music for it.

705
00:46:52,912 --> 00:46:54,313
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be very sexy indeed.

706
00:46:54,673 --> 00:46:55,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Sign me up.

707
00:46:55,334 --> 00:46:55,674
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.

708
00:46:57,444 --> 00:47:02,828
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also speculation, according to Bloomberg.com, you know, financial blah, blah, blah.

709
00:47:23,072 --> 00:47:26,674
[SPEAKER_04]: that Konami and Capcom may be Japan's next big merger.

710
00:47:26,834 --> 00:47:27,755
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be weird.

711
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:31,937
[SPEAKER_04]: And to quote my... It's so weird saying husband.

712
00:47:32,798 --> 00:47:33,759
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so married now.

713
00:47:34,599 --> 00:47:37,701
[SPEAKER_04]: But he was saying, were they going to be called Capkonami?

714
00:47:38,742 --> 00:47:39,362
[SPEAKER_01]: Capkonami.

715
00:47:40,498 --> 00:47:41,779
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would just be weird.

716
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:42,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

717
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:44,260
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't see it happening.

718
00:47:44,580 --> 00:47:45,000
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't either.

719
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:54,444
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of these companies, to do a quote in here from Takashi Oya, who's an analyst with Deutsche Securities in Tokyo.

720
00:47:55,085 --> 00:48:00,207
[SPEAKER_04]: So companies like Taito, Bandai, and Namco are not merging because they are facing financial ruin.

721
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:04,169
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking three years down the road and thinking this might be a strategic choice.

722
00:48:04,389 --> 00:48:04,549
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

723
00:48:05,319 --> 00:48:10,683
[SPEAKER_04]: And if these big, you know, because Taito, Namco, all of those are really freaking huge.

724
00:48:10,743 --> 00:48:17,247
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, it's so weird that all these game companies are suddenly like, it's like they're forming into the giant Mechatron.

725
00:48:17,348 --> 00:48:21,651
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Sega Sammy, which is weird all in itself.

726
00:48:21,911 --> 00:48:23,031
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be very few.

727
00:48:23,252 --> 00:48:24,953
[SPEAKER_04]: But, I mean, honestly...

728
00:48:25,791 --> 00:48:26,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Mega Man, Castlevania, etc.

729
00:48:43,303 --> 00:48:44,765
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

730
00:49:00,515 --> 00:49:01,996
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that would be kind of weird.

731
00:49:02,057 --> 00:49:05,440
[SPEAKER_04]: There's another comment in here that sort of bugged me.

732
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,261
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to read this little paragraph here.

733
00:49:07,341 --> 00:49:08,362
[SPEAKER_04]: What's that?

734
00:49:08,543 --> 00:49:19,453
[SPEAKER_04]: Konami is trying to break its reliance on the video game business where earnings depend on hit titles and find new revenue sources by expanding into toys, sports club, arcade machinery, and casino businesses.

735
00:49:19,933 --> 00:49:31,277
[SPEAKER_04]: Which actually, you know, I saw a number of Konami-made slot machines when I was at the casino a couple weekends ago for my honeymoon.

736
00:49:32,357 --> 00:49:36,039
[SPEAKER_04]: And Konami has always been into fitness equipment.

737
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:45,042
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're even working on a mock-up of DDR to be used as a fitness, as basically automated aerobics machine.

738
00:49:45,222 --> 00:49:49,365
[SPEAKER_01]: Consolidation is gaining pace and music movie broadcasting companies and internet portals are possible partners.

739
00:50:14,565 --> 00:50:14,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm.

740
00:50:15,585 --> 00:50:21,327
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, looking at this from the business side, that actually does make a lot of sense.

741
00:50:22,267 --> 00:50:28,669
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's saying on here that the speculated target for Konami is Capcom.

742
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:29,949
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting.

743
00:50:29,969 --> 00:50:32,110
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, Konami's number four, Capcom's number six.

744
00:50:32,190 --> 00:50:33,210
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes financial sense.

745
00:50:33,650 --> 00:50:34,010
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

746
00:50:34,250 --> 00:50:34,891
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see what happens.

747
00:50:34,911 --> 00:50:37,131
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be kind of... It would just be weird.

748
00:50:37,191 --> 00:50:37,771
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see, though.

749
00:50:37,831 --> 00:50:38,192
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see.

750
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:43,213
[SPEAKER_04]: That would be like taking my heart and breaking it in two and putting it back together.

751
00:50:45,044 --> 00:50:45,485
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?

752
00:50:45,725 --> 00:50:48,248
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I love Konami and I love Capcom.

753
00:50:49,029 --> 00:50:52,694
[SPEAKER_04]: And seeing, you know, it's like having hamsters.

754
00:50:53,515 --> 00:51:02,787
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how if one of your hamsters feels like it's threatened, its babies are threatened, like its assets are threatened, it's going to go kill the other hamster and eat it.

755
00:51:06,505 --> 00:51:07,025
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true!

756
00:51:07,185 --> 00:51:08,045
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamsters do that.

757
00:51:08,325 --> 00:51:08,986
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, I know.

758
00:51:09,006 --> 00:51:11,246
[SPEAKER_04]: But I know it's not the best analogy.

759
00:51:11,986 --> 00:51:14,567
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, it's doggy dog.

760
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:16,907
[SPEAKER_04]: In this case, it's, you know... Hamstreet hamster.

761
00:51:16,927 --> 00:51:18,068
[SPEAKER_04]: Hamstreet hamster.

762
00:51:18,428 --> 00:51:18,848
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

763
00:51:19,368 --> 00:51:20,708
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything else for us, DarkSakura?

764
00:51:21,509 --> 00:51:22,469
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, no.

765
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:23,289
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

766
00:51:23,569 --> 00:51:24,529
[SPEAKER_04]: I like fire.

767
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:25,490
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you do.

768
00:51:26,350 --> 00:51:26,930
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you do.

769
00:51:27,470 --> 00:51:30,171
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's when you truly giggle, is when you set things on fire.

770
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:31,311
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.

771
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:32,631
[SPEAKER_04]: But only when they scream.

772
00:51:33,431 --> 00:51:35,732
[SPEAKER_01]: Um... Xenosaga...

773
00:51:36,934 --> 00:51:39,702
[SPEAKER_01]: Xenosaga is coming out to the Nintendo DS.

774
00:51:40,782 --> 00:52:09,375
[SPEAKER_01]: Xenosaga 1 and 2 specifically no it's not going to be the full blown 3D movie element that you see in Xenosaga no they're going to redo it all cutesy anime style in a 2D isometric type style but still that's kind of cool I mean to remake a game that was out on the Playstation 2 and just kind of like remake all the graphics and all the stuff behind it and it's still going to have cutscenes it's just going to be done differently well they're going to remake that into a DS title

775
00:52:10,021 --> 00:52:10,962
[SPEAKER_01]: Xenosaga 1 and 2.

776
00:52:11,042 --> 00:52:14,166
[SPEAKER_01]: That also coming out of Tokyo Game Show from Monolith Soft.

777
00:52:15,167 --> 00:52:16,188
[SPEAKER_01]: Should be very interesting.

778
00:52:16,728 --> 00:52:20,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Xenosaga Episode 3, by the way, is coming out for the PlayStation 2, if you were not aware.

779
00:52:22,374 --> 00:52:22,695
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

780
00:52:23,956 --> 00:52:25,558
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, did you have anything else for us tonight?

781
00:52:25,958 --> 00:52:28,661
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw you had a story up there, so I'm curious.

782
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:32,465
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just looking at some of the stuff that they've been showing at, you know,

783
00:52:33,157 --> 00:52:34,358
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com

784
00:52:52,037 --> 00:52:57,421
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite, though, is just some of the detailed shots that they've been showing for Metal Gear Solid 4.

785
00:52:57,501 --> 00:53:00,063
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the amount of detail that's in this is incredible.

786
00:53:01,323 --> 00:53:07,668
[SPEAKER_02]: The other game that looks really cool is the Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.

787
00:53:08,348 --> 00:53:10,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the stuff in there actually looks like CNN footage.

788
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:12,891
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how detailed it is.

789
00:53:13,852 --> 00:53:14,092
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.

790
00:53:15,891 --> 00:53:23,558
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, what really scares me is they're talking about making a Lone and Dark for the PS3, so that might give Bowie Bowles some inspiration to make another movie.

791
00:53:24,399 --> 00:53:26,841
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have that, so... I hope not.

792
00:53:27,282 --> 00:53:27,542
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

793
00:53:28,563 --> 00:53:28,863
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

794
00:53:29,364 --> 00:53:31,206
[SPEAKER_01]: I got one more story for you guys tonight, then.

795
00:53:32,267 --> 00:53:36,010
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a brand new... This is usually the type of thing you talk about, Loki, but I'm stealing this from you tonight.

796
00:53:36,651 --> 00:53:36,711
[SPEAKER_01]: Um...

797
00:53:37,737 --> 00:53:40,820
[SPEAKER_01]: Recording video via your PSP.

798
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:45,243
[SPEAKER_01]: A company called Hori is making a brand new PSP accessory.

799
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:54,051
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically what it is, it's a little rectangle looking device and what it does is you can hook it up so that you can record video straight onto your memory stick.

800
00:53:55,011 --> 00:53:55,872
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much it.

801
00:53:55,892 --> 00:53:58,294
[SPEAKER_01]: You can record video using your PSP right onto your memory stick.

802
00:53:58,594 --> 00:54:02,037
[SPEAKER_01]: About $115 is what it's going to cost.

803
00:54:02,057 --> 00:54:05,500
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 12,800 yen coming out in November in Japan.

804
00:54:05,956 --> 00:54:06,296
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura.com

805
00:54:27,933 --> 00:54:28,974
[SPEAKER_01]: on PSP.

806
00:54:29,654 --> 00:54:39,244
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, if you're making adult films with your PSP, don't leave it where people are going to find it because they'll get put all over the internet like, you know, those celebrities like Pam Anderson and stuff.

807
00:54:41,286 --> 00:54:45,050
[SPEAKER_01]: On that note, that's going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

808
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:47,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys so much for tuning in, subscribing to us.

809
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:52,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell somebody you know and you love about Orange Lounge Radio and help spread the word.

810
00:54:52,701 --> 00:54:55,123
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, tell somebody you hate about Orange Lounge Radio.

811
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:57,885
[SPEAKER_04]: Tee hee, tee hee, insert bad joke here.

812
00:54:57,925 --> 00:54:58,325
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.

813
00:55:00,226 --> 00:55:09,412
[SPEAKER_01]: And a reminder to check OrangeLoungeRadio.com and check out our Hurricane Katrina relief we're doing with the other Sacramento companies, Dark Records and Club 21.

814
00:55:10,733 --> 00:55:13,375
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you guys next time here on the podcast.

815
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:14,476
[SPEAKER_01]: Final thoughts.

816
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:15,056
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki.

817
00:55:16,667 --> 00:55:17,087
[SPEAKER_02]: JackThompson

818
00:55:48,255 --> 00:55:48,635
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

819
00:55:48,915 --> 00:55:58,182
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a whole bunch of emails or fake emails I should say that are on the Liberty City Stories webpage so go check those out as well.

820
00:56:00,424 --> 00:56:06,829
[SPEAKER_01]: My final thought is I'm still craving a milkshake now that you both had them during the three hour program earlier this evening and I didn't.

821
00:56:07,369 --> 00:56:09,511
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm suffering for it.

822
00:56:10,212 --> 00:56:10,572
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.

823
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:12,153
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, your final thought.

824
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,001
[SPEAKER_04]: Two sort of final thoughts.

825
00:56:15,101 --> 00:56:15,922
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm correcting myself.

826
00:56:16,403 --> 00:56:22,569
[SPEAKER_04]: It wasn't police knots that had the mini RC looking metal gear like Otacon was using.

827
00:56:22,869 --> 00:56:27,374
[SPEAKER_04]: It was Snatcher, which is another Kojima game that was on Sega CD.

828
00:56:28,255 --> 00:56:28,895
[SPEAKER_04]: Good luck finding it.

829
00:56:30,197 --> 00:56:31,037
[SPEAKER_01]: And your second final thought?

830
00:56:31,258 --> 00:56:32,038
[SPEAKER_04]: Reject false icons.

831
00:56:32,199 --> 00:56:32,479
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.

832
00:56:33,806 --> 00:56:35,367
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go ditz my way off now.

833
00:56:35,567 --> 00:56:35,927
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

834
00:56:35,987 --> 00:56:36,607
[SPEAKER_01]: Have fun with that.

835
00:56:36,847 --> 00:56:42,290
[SPEAKER_01]: And from us to you, have a great day, afternoon, or evening whenever you're listening to this.

836
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:44,271
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see you next time on Orange Lounge Radio To Go.

837
00:56:45,972 --> 00:56:49,553
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

838
00:56:49,834 --> 00:56:55,396
[SPEAKER_00]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com.

839
00:56:55,856 --> 00:56:56,817
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update.
