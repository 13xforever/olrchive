Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

10
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:40,020
Over there, say hello to DarkSakura.

11
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,640
Hi, I'm the Giggly Pussy Girl.

12
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:46,020
How are you?

13
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,500
Full of rage.

14
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:51,020
If only they knew what a bitch you really were, huh?

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:52,460
Oh, if only.

16
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,300
That's all right.

17
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:56,860
You know, that little bastard on, what was that site?

18
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,380
Just don't give it this time of day.

19
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:07,660
But I just have to say that I've probably been gaming since that little newbie wannabe

20
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:09,260
was in diapers.

21
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:13,940
I was sitting there with my Pong machine back in the day.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,380
I am more the gamer than you will ever hope to be.

23
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:18,380
Alright.

24
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,380
But somewhere else?

25
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,900
I had to adjust it and get it out of my system.

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,900
Feel better?

27
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,300
Yeah, I actually do feel a lot better, but that's also proof that I'm anything but giggly

28
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:31,220
and Ditzy, thank you very much. She's a real bitch, ladies and gentlemen. I am, I really am.

29
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,860
Loki, say hello to Techmaster Loki, how you doing? I'm doing good.

30
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:39,660
Who also is a really big bitch, if you get to know him.

31
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,780
No, forget it. What's on your mind? Loki, how you doing?

32
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,420
Not much. What the hell is this you're looking at? Is this like Deer Hunter on the Xbox 360 or something?

33
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:51,540
No, that's a screenshot of Elder Scrolls IV.

34
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,540
It looks like a deer hunter game to me with the deer.

35
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:57,540
It looks like the deer from the deer scene in Ring 2, which sucked.

36
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:01,540
But you know, they will come out with a deer hunter game, I'm sure, for that.

37
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:04,540
For the Walmart arcades across America.

38
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:08,540
You ever notice that every Walmart arcade, quote of what you've ever walked into,

39
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:11,540
has some type of deer hunting machine, at least around here.

40
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,540
There's always some type of deer hunting machine and a crane.

41
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:18,540
And amazingly enough, one of the pubs I go to in Old Sac has a deer hunting game.

42
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:24,900
game amazing really well alright anyway we like to start off the podcast by

43
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:28,220
talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week dark soccer would

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,740
even playing this week I know you've been doing a lot of giggling and having

45
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:33,740
all those slumber parties and talking about boys but if you actually had any

46
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:37,980
time to play some games what were you able to find well I don't know out of

47
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,260
the 40-something video game systems that I own yeah have I not been able to find

48
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,900
something to play no serious I've been playing my Nintendo trying to you know

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:49,540
to keep them from running away and pissing on my dinner marks.

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
That's such a girl game!

51
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,540
You play it too, okay?

52
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,540
Oh yeah, that's right.

53
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:55,660
And so does Loki over here who owns three copies of it.

54
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,420
I'm thinking of selling two of them.

55
00:02:58,420 --> 00:02:59,420
Give me one.

56
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,420
No!

57
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
Puppies!

58
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,420
Alright, so Nintendo.

59
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,420
Yeah, Nintendo.

60
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,420
Puppies!

61
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:10,140
Um, I've been playing with my puppies and then, um, I got World of Warcraft and installed

62
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,140
it today.

63
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,140
Finally!

64
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:15,100
Like a year later, one of us gets sucked into World of Warcraft, so...

65
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,100
Not quite sucked in.

66
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:20,780
sort of pissed off actually really livid that for the lack of controller option

67
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:25,340
I mean I can play on the keyboard but the controller is so much more efficient

68
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:31,160
especially since I got used to playing that way on that game that sucks which

69
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:38,760
is the game I still play thank you very much I hate being forced into being

70
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,000
social with people who are idiots everybody's complained about the game to

71
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,440
which I say why do they call it a massively multiplayer because you're

72
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,440
supposed to play with other people but not necessarily that you play with other

73
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,720
people it's that you interact with other people whatever and at least it's not

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:59,320
like in right right kill please whoop gh k thanks bye fuck you

75
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:03,720
you know for the people say warp me to here warp me to here I wanted a priest

76
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:10,720
with only the the gas time warp so that if they say warp me to to the Christmas

77
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,160
place you know five of our audience has probably ever played Ragnarok and

78
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,800
Well, I mean, Ludie, I would be gas times like the haunted place where big, horrible things kill you.

79
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:19,300
Yeah, okay.

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,360
I was level like 70-something and I still couldn't beat everything there.

81
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:23,160
Yeah.

82
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,240
Um, anyway, um...

83
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:31,740
I played that... I played actually a few online games. I've been playing something on, uh, gorillas.com.

84
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,240
Mhm.

85
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,340
I've been playing, um, uh, Froggus.

86
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:36,840
Okay.

87
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:41,400
Which is... Okay, there's like a little... There's things you can do on the site and collect items and you do certain things.

88
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,800
One of the things is you collect this potion that you'd go up to Noodle's room and insert into Shawn Ryder's head

89
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,920
Okay, and to get the last potion you have to play Frogger

90
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,560
But it's like you go there get the potion and come back. So and it's like horrible silly flash games silly flash games

91
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,560
Yeah, it's kind of fun

92
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,200
um

93
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:03,520
Dan also picked up like night shade and I go because I got really cheap and he gets a discount in the store and he

94
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,040
Picked up whatever that burnout game is on PSP and has been playing it religiously

95
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,240
Burnout Legends as I'm sure Loki will talk about later. Honestly the more I

96
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,040
hear burnout the more pissed off I get because I was trying to do my fucking

97
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:21,220
illustrator homework on Saturday night and not Saturday night I'm sorry on

98
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:26,860
Friday night and he comes in him and his buddy playing burnout as loud as our 50

99
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:33,320
inch widescreen TV would go and I was PMS and hardcore that night I went out

100
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,680
out there let him have it ate a bunch of chocolate and went to bed all right so

101
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,740
right now that game is on my shit list well I was gonna recommend for World of

102
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:45,960
Warcraft check out some of the communities out there because I bet you

103
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,240
somebody's got a mod out there you can't be the only one who desires to play

104
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:52,200
controllers got to be something going on out there so check it out you can mod

105
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:58,720
pretty much everything in World of Warcraft using Lua I like all the

106
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,220
interfaces like someone actually created an auction interface there where you can

107
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:06,540
actually it will tell you what the item that you're trying to sell is going for

108
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:10,820
what the previous history is and what they think that you can get for it and

109
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:14,540
that type of stuff that's pretty cool sounds cool all right Loki what do you

110
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:20,140
been playing this week I've been playing burnout revenge and that game is it's

111
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:23,820
awesome you know the first thing we did started playing traffic attack because

112
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,980
there's nothing like you know driving 209 miles an hour it's smashing into

113
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:34,980
every single car in the world on this freaking track and just having them fly over you like

114
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:40,900
a wake of water. It's just, it's great. It's the most fun ever. And the take down mode

115
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,820
when you're playing that you can actually use the crash breaker which makes your car

116
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:51,140
explode. So that's really fun as well. The only complaint I have about it is the new

117
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:55,780
way that they're doing the crash mode. They have this kind of, it's almost like golf games

118
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:02,300
where you have a little meter on the side and you have to hit your button once to stop

119
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:06,320
the meter and then hit it again before it goes too low.

120
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:10,980
And basically how accurately you hit that is how fast you go.

121
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:13,820
And it's really strange how they've done that.

122
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:19,380
And I didn't quite get it at first so I made my car explode or stall and stuff like that.

123
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:21,860
But other than that it's pretty cool.

124
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:26,360
I just can't wait to unlock more cars because it's been pretty tough to do that.

125
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:30,060
Then Burnout Legends, I've been playing that for the PSP, and that game is fun.

126
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:33,460
The only thing that sucks about that game is you actually, that game forces you to play with

127
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:34,340
other people

128
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:37,500
because in order to unlock all the cars there's

129
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,600
six cars that are

130
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:44,140
for each game and you have to actually go to play other people with those cars

131
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:44,500
and

132
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:48,180
it's almost like Nintendogs is what they're doing with it.

133
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:51,780
So that's pretty much it. Just racing games. Just Burnout Burnout Burnout all week long.

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:57,500
Yeah, I'm going to try to pick, or I have Urban Reign, I should try to play that.

135
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:01,260
It's kind of a fighting game, but beat-em-up game at the same time.

136
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,260
It's like Tekken.

137
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:09,500
It actually has Paul Phoenix and Law in it from the Tekken series, which, had I known

138
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:16,420
that when I was selling it, I probably would have sold it a bit better, but oh well.

139
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:19,900
Alright, let's see, what have I been playing this week?

140
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:26,900
I had a seven hour marathon of Final Fantasy XI this weekend. Never again will I play an MMO for that long.

141
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:30,900
But it was one of those things where it was like, there was a mission, and we all wanted to get it done,

142
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:35,900
and on top of that I'd already been leveling. It was like, I really had a lazy Saturday in every essence of the word.

143
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:42,900
And so, I'm sure some MMO addicts out there are cheering me on right now, but my god, that was just too much MMO for me on Saturday.

144
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:48,900
I haven't played Final Fantasy XI for a long time. I'm actually thinking, I have enough PTO where I can take a couple days off, I think, to actually play Final Fantasy.

145
00:08:48,900 --> 00:09:00,900
What else did I play? I got to check out a couple new games. I actually went out and bought a copy of Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks, which is one of the games I played at E3.

146
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,900
It was one of those pleasant surprise games for me where I wasn't really expecting a whole lot out of the title, but I actually had a lot of fun with it at E3.

147
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:14,900
So I thought, okay, I'm going to check this out. I'm going to buy it for the console. So I decided to buy it for Xbox for no real reason than I wanted Xbox games.

148
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:20,940
Oh, yeah, now that I have HDTV the fact that Xbox kind of supports HD a little bit better than the other systems

149
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:23,600
I think kind of sells me on more Xbox games

150
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:29,620
Although Mortal Kombat doesn't really support widescreen or any of that, but whatever it's still really pretty looking the graphics in the game

151
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,340
Very colorful very nice looking a very similar graphical style to the previous Mortal Kombat game

152
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:42,660
Not deadly alliance, but what was the one in between I can't remember the name of it now Mortal Kombat deception

153
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:44,660
Thank you, Deception was the one that just recently out.

154
00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:46,660
See, if I weren't a real gamer, I wouldn't know that.

155
00:09:46,660 --> 00:09:48,660
We get it, we get it, honey.

156
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,660
Alright, um, we get it.

157
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,660
Anyway, um,

158
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,660
you remember that

159
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,660
Mortal Kombat Deception had that conquest

160
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,660
mode in it. It's kind of like they decided to take

161
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,660
conquest and kind of go, let's try

162
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:02,660
and make a game out of it. But it's, the game

163
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,660
itself isn't playing like the

164
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,660
conquest mode. It's more like, honestly, this is the

165
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,660
best thing I could describe it. It felt to me like

166
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,660
I was playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade

167
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,660
game, but with Mortal Kombat characters.

168
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:18,020
You remember when they tried to do that side-scrolling RPG-type game with Sub-Zero and X?

169
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:19,020
It was awful.

170
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,460
The mythology games were awful.

171
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:23,620
No, but this one is surprisingly pretty fun.

172
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,700
It's really good.

173
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,700
It's pretty action-based.

174
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:31,820
Honestly, the best comparison I can think of is the Ninja Turtles arcade game, except

175
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:35,140
it's Mortal Kombat characters, and you're just beating people up left and right, and

176
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:39,060
you can do all these fancy combos, and as you gain experience, you can purchase new

177
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:44,620
combos and new things. So it's actually a lot of fun. My only minor complaints with

178
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Shaolin Monks is that there's just some real basic gameplay mechanic things that don't

179
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:55,900
work for me, such as the fatalities. I think the fatalities are kind of fun and it's kind

180
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,400
of cute they put them in there, but unfortunately you only get one fatality in the beginning

181
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,200
and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've been playing the game for a couple

182
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,600
hours now and I just got like a new fatality called a multi ality or

183
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,280
something like that

184
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:12,280
well they're supposed to be looking in the list a blank fatalities like 20

185
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,160
different things you can do

186
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,000
I guess I haven't found any yet maybe I'm supposed to find them myself I don't

187
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,400
know

188
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:21,100
but I get kinda bored with a fatality theme is like I'm doing the same thing

189
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:21,600
over and over

190
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,440
slice slice slice you know with the hat is playing as Kung Lao right now so I'm

191
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,800
doing the hat slice and half

192
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,600
and it's cute at first and really funny and you know graphically well done

193
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,340
but it gets old. I think if the fatality combo meter filled maybe like half as

194
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:35,900
fast

195
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,780
see the fatality thing you only did half as often, I think it would have been better. It seems

196
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,780
like the fatality thing is really repetitive

197
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,740
but you gain an awful lot of experience from doing it so you feel like you have to do it all

198
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,300
the time.

199
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,860
The other thing that kind of irked me is that you can get caught going in loops

200
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,380
if you don't really understand where you're going or what you're doing. Like

201
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:55,580
the enemies always seem to regenerate in these certain places

202
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:59,100
and while that can be really good for gaining a lot of experience really fast

203
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:03,140
it kinda makes you feel like you're not doing anything and so I kinda wish that

204
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,060
at some point the enemies went away and left you alone for a little while so you

205
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,780
can kind of figure out okay where do I go next

206
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:10,860
and then new enemies come out so I kinda got a little monotonous there

207
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,580
and then my only other complaint would be the lack of save points

208
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:18,740
I can literally go 45 minutes in the game and not find a single save point

209
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:22,340
so there really needed to be about twice as many save points as there are so that

210
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,360
was a little bit frustrating

211
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:26,940
otherwise though those are just you know really in the grand scope of things some

212
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,300
minor complaints I think the game is a heck of a lot of fun if you're if you're

213
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:34,220
a fan of Mortal Kombat in any way you're gonna like this game because it really

214
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:38,420
gets into the story better so than any of the movies ever did it really gets

215
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:43,020
into the story and it does a great job I mean movies there was only one movie

216
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:47,540
there was two I know you're denying the existence of it but believe it or not

217
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:53,420
there was a second movie I want back it was so good that they actually made a

218
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:58,720
TV series too that's that's right huh oh god anyway um just to put in

219
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,960
perspective just how cool this game can be sometimes like I was playing this one

220
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,280
level the last level I was on I was fighting katana jade and Molina all at

221
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:11,420
once like this level and suddenly katana I don't want to spoil the story but

222
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:14,420
something happens where katana is taken out of the picture basically and then

223
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,680
it's just jade and Molina and you can like throw them into these traps and

224
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:22,180
then hit this switch and it goes into the test your might mode from like

225
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:25,660
Mortal Kombat 1 where you have to really slam all the buttons, they kind of overdo that

226
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,800
a little bit in the game, but it's still really cute that they brought back Test Your Might.

227
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,120
And like, if you do the Test Your Might thing, then you'll like set a fire trap so you can

228
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,760
set Mileena on fire a little bit. Just cute little things like that, I can't believe I

229
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,160
called it cute, but seriously, like little things like that-

230
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,240
Mortal Kombat's so cute! It's not cute anymore, there's no Babalities!

231
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,920
Anyway, or Animalities. Babalities. Friendship!

232
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,880
So Mortal Kombat, I recommend it to fans of the Mortal Kombat series, and just if you

233
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,420
like those action fighting style games, you'll probably get a kick out of this, but if it

234
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,640
doesn't sound like your kind of game, you're probably not going to like it.

235
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,800
You know what else, because that did get released earlier, it was scheduled originally for the

236
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:06,180
21st, they've got another fighting game coming out that looks pretty good, and I actually

237
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:10,220
played a demo of it, Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, which is a Marvel game

238
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:14,860
they actually kind of, it's sort of like an arena fighting game type of thing, but they

239
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:19,300
They added their own characters with their background stories too, which were really

240
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:20,300
cool from my side.

241
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:24,280
It kind of reminded me of Twisted Mel Black a bit, the way they did the stories.

242
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,500
But really fun.

243
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,380
Really quick, the other game I played this week I want to give a real quick review to.

244
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:32,900
I actually got to play We Heart Katamari, because as you might have heard on last week's

245
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,660
show, Target, some of the Target stores acquired copies of the game and sold them early because

246
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:41,300
the game's not actually out until this week, so We Heart Katamari is going to be on shelves

247
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,300
this week.

248
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,100
I did get a chance to play it via one of my friends.

249
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:49,160
I only got to play like the first two levels, but I'm telling you what kids if you liked the first Katamari Dimash

250
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:54,120
He ain't gonna be disappointed. The movies are just as quirky as they were the first time

251
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:57,160
It's kind of like the first game was so successful

252
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:02,860
they gave them a bigger budget to go through with this second game and you really see that they've kind of put more into this

253
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:07,680
Game and just you know, it's it's more the same but at the same time

254
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,880
It just works. I don't know how else to explain

255
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,320
It just works if you were a fan of the first game. You're like this game

256
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:16,160
If you weren't a fan of the first game, I don't think there's anything new here

257
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:19,260
That's gonna win you over. But if you haven't played the Katamari Damacy game

258
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:22,800
Check this out. It's it's just such a quirky little title

259
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:29,160
I I think I think you guys get a kick out of it and the music the music not quite as solid as the first

260
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,960
Game, but the music is a lot of fun, too

261
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,460
And that the script is the writing is just as hilarious as it was in the first game. It's great

262
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:38,780
Katamari fans won't be disappointed

263
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,060
Alright, let's get into some news for tonight.

264
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,460
Starting it off with a little bit of Tokyo Game Show news, and of course, how could we

265
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,460
not mention this?

266
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:51,300
This has been everybody's gamer blog out there on the internet said something about this.

267
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:54,980
I'm sure all the other gaming podcasts you guys subscribed to probably talked about this

268
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:55,980
at some point.

269
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,980
We have to say something about it.

270
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:59,940
Nintendo Revolution, the controller.

271
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,940
What is this?

272
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:05,060
The Nintendo nunchucks or something, where you've got the one little piece with the analog

273
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,560
stick and then a remote control.

274
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
What's up with this?

275
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:08,560
What do you guys think of this?

276
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:10,400
pictures out on our website, oranceandrea.com.

277
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:12,960
Even though this technically goes into another segment,

278
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,040
actually one of our listeners emailed us, Britney,

279
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,640
who basically agreed with me.

280
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:22,800
It's like using a big freakin' remote control.

281
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,620
Now Nintendo says, and I think part of the reason

282
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,880
that they're doing this is that they wanna kinda lure in

283
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,120
people that are a little scared of,

284
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,000
when they see a gaming controller, they think,

285
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,080
ah, it's a gaming thing, and I'm not really hip on this.

286
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,600
So by making a remote control device,

287
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,720
uses a remote control they tried this before sort of with a system called the

288
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:48,860
fairchild channel okay with a little tiny little controller at the top and a

289
00:16:48,860 --> 00:16:52,060
little hold stick that you hold it's a little different but that controller

290
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,420
sucked the whole system sucked honestly so do you think the revolution is gonna

291
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:59,300
suck this controller well you know the one thing that I say about about a

292
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:04,860
system a system is only as good as the games that are on it I agree but part of

293
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:12,020
The game is how it's controlled. That's major part of the gameplay right? There's how you're controlling it. This thing looks uncomfortable

294
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,940
Mm-hmm

295
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:18,780
Lately my whole big thing has been ergonomics and like I said on our three-hour show

296
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,180
this one

297
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:25,140
Looks highly uncomfortable. It's you're gonna be holding your wrist

298
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,560
Okay, take your hand hold it straight up turn your wrist sideways and do like you're holding a remote control now

299
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:38,080
Now imagine holding your hand in this position for an hour, two hours, however long you plan

300
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,600
on playing a game.

301
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:44,140
Now do you think that that's a natural position for your hand to be in?

302
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:45,880
Imagine the stress you're putting your joints under.

303
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:51,680
Now imagine if you are an older gamer, you work at, say, a desk job on a computer.

304
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,960
You're already putting your arm through stress that way.

305
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,320
Imagine the stress you're putting it through with this system that's supposed to help you

306
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,200
relax, have some fun.

307
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,560
You're going to be hurting.

308
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,480
I think it's gonna cause, you know, true medical issues.

309
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:05,840
Do you think, though, that this will come out

310
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:07,200
in the testing process?

311
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,440
For instance, something I had brought up

312
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:10,400
on our three-hour program, we were talking about this,

313
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,640
the three-hour show, Sunday nights,

314
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,320
on orangehonserator.com, we were talking about

315
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,800
this controller issue a little bit,

316
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,480
and I mentioned that the DS at E3,

317
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:19,800
the year that the DS came out,

318
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,720
it changed from E3 to when it actually came out,

319
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:25,060
and you said it's a little more comfortable

320
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,120
than it was at E3.

321
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,200
So do you think that maybe after they test this a little bit,

322
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,800
if they find these type of ergonomic issues

323
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:34,080
their testers they might change this a little bit make it I don't know how they

324
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,400
can drastically without making drastic changes the controller make it a little

325
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:41,160
more ergonomic but maybe just the way the games play one would hope so one

326
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,080
would really hope so so we'll see but don't knock it till you tried it right

327
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,800
yeah absolutely I mean I'll give it a fair go but honestly I'll get that

328
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:52,440
little wave bird looking thingy you know something what was that Loki you posted

329
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:55,620
like a mock-up on our website was this a real-deal picture or a mock-up a lot of

330
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:59,020
our feedback is a mock-up of a Wavebird controller.

331
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:04,980
It's something that was the president of Nintendo's development or something like that. They're

332
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:08,420
talking about how they're going to be adding that. It's just they're going to have a ton

333
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:13,980
of attachments, which means more stuff you've got to buy, but I'm not saying that the other

334
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:19,500
systems aren't doing that either, Microsoft, and it looks good. I think it'll work really

335
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:23,660
well actually. I don't think it's going to be a problem at all. I mean, you hold controllers

336
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:29,020
in your hand I don't see you know it's just like it's just like a remote

337
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:33,800
positioning I think I think if it's light enough it's not gonna be a problem

338
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:37,640
the thing I find remote controls uncomfortable the thing I like about it

339
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,060
though is that you can take that remote control turn it 90 degrees and you've

340
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:44,420
basically got an old style NES controller and that would be cool yep

341
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,580
so that would be more comfortable but I'm thinking though the intended way

342
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:53,980
like a remote control and I know this from experience because I played space

343
00:19:53,980 --> 00:19:57,540
ace on my DVD player right and I hurt by the time I was done

344
00:19:57,540 --> 00:20:02,340
I know how this is going to feel and it's not it's not natural but maybe do

345
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,980
you think maybe we're being misled by these pictures a little bit that are

346
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:07,740
showing it like maybe this won't be the way it actually plays because I can't

347
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:11,940
see how with your thumb you'd be able to hit that control pad and have you guys

348
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,380
seen the video of this I I didn't have time to download have you guys seen the

349
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,660
from Tokyo Game Show?

350
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:17,700
Well, describe it for us.

351
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:20,140
Well, for example, the way that it was shown,

352
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,060
this is the video they showed everybody

353
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:24,340
when they were unveiling it, is it actually

354
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:28,900
looks like it's from the view that you're in the TV.

355
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:32,180
And basically, you're using that as you're not

356
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,780
using the buttons on the controller.

357
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:36,660
The controller itself, because it acts like a 3D mouse,

358
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:37,940
is what you're using.

359
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:41,180
So for example, some of the things that they're showing,

360
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:44,820
you could say this might be the next WarioWare game.

361
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:51,020
a guy was chopping using the controller, acting like a knife, and frying stuff like a knife.

362
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:55,720
I had heard now, I had read that there was a video out there of the Metroid Prime 2 echoes

363
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,980
being kind of played on this setup where they said moving around using the Bluetooth or

364
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:02,220
whatever it is that's in there that senses where you are in the room.

365
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:06,480
Well, the way it works is there's two sensors you put on your TV and it basically figures

366
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:10,820
out, it triangulates where your controller is going to be, kind of similar to the power

367
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:12,140
glove that came out.

368
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:17,820
Now the other things that they showed with this is playing tennis you know like you would

369
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:25,460
be just like racket fishing also you know like sword fighting stuff like that another

370
00:21:25,460 --> 00:21:29,420
thing which could be like in the next Luigi's mansion using it as a flashlight something

371
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:35,220
like that but then for like first person shooter games they're saying like okay with the analog

372
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:42,000
or the nunchuck add on there you use the analog to move around and basically the other controller

373
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,280
the remote would be the gun. You would point at what you want to fire at and pull the trigger

374
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:49,560
button underneath and there you go, you're shooting something. Or you want to switch

375
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,600
your weapon, you know, hit the button on top there. Plus the analog has two buttons on

376
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,560
it as well. Two trigger buttons. So I think it's going to work because really there's

377
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:04,480
no way it can't work because if something, if you know, a game calls for something else,

378
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,900
they'll build another add-on for it. They always do. So alright. Well it'll be interesting

379
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,960
to see what happens. I'm sure we'll see more and more of this leading up to next year's

380
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:14,360
E3, which I'm sure will be a big, big unveil.

381
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,080
And here's the other thing, too.

382
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:16,800
Third party.

383
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,680
I mean, third party's going to be developing controllers.

384
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:19,560
You don't like this one?

385
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,640
Buy a third party controller.

386
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,040
It's going to look different anyways.

387
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,640
It'll be something you probably want.

388
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:24,600
All right, we'll see.

389
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,400
All right, if you guys have additional feedback,

390
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,740
you can always visit our forums, orangelaungeradio.com.

391
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,080
There's definitely a thread about this.

392
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:31,040
They're talking about that.

393
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,240
It's also our poll going on right now on the main page

394
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,000
of orangelaungeradio.com.

395
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:35,560
Check that out.

396
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:36,040
Answer it.

397
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,360
What do you think of the Nintendo Revolution controller?

398
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,640
Now the real question is, what color Nintendo Revolution

399
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,760
are you going to buy?

400
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,680
the green one, because they have the green, red,

401
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:48,660
the gray, the chrome, white, and black.

402
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,320
We're gonna have the red.

403
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,220
All right, also on our main page,

404
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:54,680
we definitely want to take a minute to recognize this.

405
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:59,320
There is a banner right there for a fundraiser effort

406
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,960
we're doing for Hurricane Katrina relief.

407
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,440
And it's not just us, we're doing it together

408
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,560
with some other companies in Sacramento,

409
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:08,040
Dark Records and Club 21 slash Rapture.

410
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:10,360
And it's a fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina.

411
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:18,900
Not just money, but what we're looking for is donations as well, food items for animals

412
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:23,900
is a big thing that we're looking for because we're trying to also raise money and general

413
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,540
awareness to the animal victims of Hurricane Katrina.

414
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:29,860
So check out the website for more details.

415
00:23:29,860 --> 00:23:33,320
If you're in the Sacramento area where our show is based, there's a lot you can do to

416
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:38,500
help out with this because you can actually donate at Club 21 on Thursday nights.

417
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:43,000
Even if you're anywhere in the world, we are taking financial donations, and if you'd like

418
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:50,260
it to be specifically forwarded to the SPCA for pet relief, note that, and we'll collect

419
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,740
all that money together and send it on behalf of Orange Launch Radio.

420
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:56,940
So check that out.

421
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,220
We did mention, though, that we are working with Dark Records and Club 21.

422
00:24:02,220 --> 00:24:06,460
Alright, moving on into some gaming news tonight.

423
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:12,980
a lot of news coming from, uh, the Tokyo Game Show. Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots

424
00:24:12,980 --> 00:24:18,720
is the title, 8 minute long preview for this game. Did you check it out, Logan? I checked

425
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,300
it out. What'd you think? It's interesting, Snake is quite old. Yeah, so it's gonna be

426
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:26,660
like a future thing now. Yeah. No, you know what I thought was the coolest thing was the

427
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:30,820
little mini Metal Gear with Otakon on it that they took right out of Policenauts. That was

428
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,840
freakin' cool. Pretty cool. So, uh, that's definitely something to look forward to. I'm

429
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,200
I'm sure a lot of fans are looking forward to the Metal Gear.

430
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:43,520
I was reading too, a lot of people were thinking, oh, it's pre-rendered, you know, it's crap.

431
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:49,560
They were saying, though, that they actually, what was it, Kojima, they showed that the

432
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:56,720
actual presentation was actually being rendered real-time, and they stopped it and panned

433
00:24:56,720 --> 00:25:03,400
of round snake as well to you know kind of stop those disbelievers from posting

434
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:09,560
crap about so interesting looks good speaking of Kojima he basically said

435
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:14,600
that Metal Gear 4 will be I'm sorry Metal Gear Solid 4 will be his last but

436
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:18,240
I kind of think didn't he say the same thing after Metal Gear Solid 3 he was

437
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:22,040
gonna do another one we have Hulk Hogan syndrome here the man keeps saying he's

438
00:25:22,040 --> 00:25:28,240
gonna retire but he always shows up at WrestleMania well he also now now Kojima

439
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:33,440
also says that yoji shinkawa who's the art director will be leaving with him so

440
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
he's not just saying I'm leaving saying that the art director is going with him

441
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:42,920
so should be interesting if this really happens but remember this if Kojima did

442
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:46,320
leave it wouldn't be the first Metal Gear Solid or game that they would do

443
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:50,360
without him because you might remember snakes revenge on the NES which also by

444
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:53,480
the way was kind of a bad yeah but that wasn't really Metal Gear I don't even

445
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:59,000
think he acknowledges it because there was actually a Metal Gear 2 on the MSX

446
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:03,480
in Japan his direct quote was I decided to make the real sequel to Metal Gear

447
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:10,900
when he saw set snakes revenge oh yeah all right also coming out of Tokyo game

448
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:14,480
show those who music game fans are gonna be very pleased to hear that Konami

449
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:18,000
after a long hiatus is gonna be putting out brand new guitar freaks and drum

450
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,960
Mania games. That's right, Gittadora, as the series is sometimes referred to as

451
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:27,080
getting the V games released. Don't know quite yet if it's a combo game, but

452
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,960
since we know that all the previous PlayStation 2 releases, which ended at

453
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:37,240
Guitar Freaks fourth mix and Drum Mania third mix, were combined together. To put

454
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:41,160
this into some perspective for you guys, Guitar Freaks V, I think is what the

455
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:46,660
11th or 12th? I lost count. I think it's like the 12th of Guitar Freaks in the

456
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:51,600
arcade and the last one we got on ps2 is 4 so there's a whole lot of ground to

457
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:56,100
cover here with these new games that are coming out on the ps2 gonna come out in

458
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,820
2006 in Japan no word yet if the series will finally make a crossover into

459
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,700
America but I think what might make or break that would be Konami if they

460
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:10,980
watch the success of guitar hero which is what red octane and harmonics are

461
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:13,620
gonna be putting out pretty soon I believe before the end of the year so

462
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:14,620
So it'll be interesting to see.

463
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:19,140
If that does very well, then Konami might try to take back the market that they kind

464
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,140
of created overseas.

465
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:21,140
It's kind of weird.

466
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,140
Oh, don't worry.

467
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,220
Interesting way it works out there.

468
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:24,740
They'll take notice.

469
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:25,740
Alright.

470
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,260
Also, I wanted to point out some Final Fantasy news from Tokyo Game Show.

471
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:33,540
Final Fantasy XI will definitely be expanding.

472
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:39,600
Treasures of At-Organ was announced officially, the new expansion pack, to be released with

473
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,560
the Xbox 360, assumably, version of Final Fantasy XI.

474
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:47,680
Some early preview videos are hinting that Blue Mage will be one of the new

475
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,000
classes because in the video you could see

476
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:53,040
this is one of the videos I did download, of course, you can actually see

477
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,080
I think it was a human was breathing fire in one of the videos and like

478
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:58,700
Ataru was shooting spider web using one of the spider's attacks.

479
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:01,920
Pretty neat looking artifact armor for Blue Mage too.

480
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:05,920
Also there's another mystery kind of job class, not quite sure what it is, but it looks

481
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,480
like there's another job class in there too.

482
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,880
All you have to do is look to Tactics for your ideas.

483
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:11,880
Yep, look to Tactics for ideas.

484
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:16,680
I should have said... I would have... I thought that Alchemist or Geomancer would be for sure,

485
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:20,280
because I especially thought Geomancer with all the elemental focus and stuff,

486
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:22,080
but it doesn't look like that's the new class.

487
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,480
World of Warcraft has that.

488
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,780
I know, but...

489
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:26,480
Blue Mage would be cool.

490
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,480
But, you know, there's gonna... yeah, everybody's gonna be a Blue Mage.

491
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,480
Alright.

492
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,480
So, we will see.

493
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,180
We don't have any details as to when these games are coming out,

494
00:28:35,180 --> 00:28:38,900
but we're thinking, I'm thinking anyway, probably early 2006.

495
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,700
I would say it would be a good guesstimate.

496
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,460
Also, Final Fantasy related.

497
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,380
Now, Jamie, this has to be a Final Fantasy game

498
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:48,060
that you like, because if not, you're just not human.

499
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:50,880
Final Fantasy IV will be coming out for the,

500
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,540
now you smiled there, you like Final Fantasy IV, right?

501
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:55,540
Yeah, the five was better, but I do like four.

502
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:59,260
Final Fantasy IV is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.

503
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:01,120
So still some life there in the Game Boy Advance,

504
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,500
it's not all DS right now.

505
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:07,220
Final Fantasy IV is being ported to the Game Boy Advance in Japan on December 12th.

506
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:12,060
Um, it will include new areas and get this, new characters.

507
00:29:12,060 --> 00:29:12,940
Uh-oh!

508
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:16,860
Should be interesting. My gut reaction tells me, oh my gosh, Palom and Porum.

509
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,460
Finally will be able to be unstoned and rejoin your party.

510
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,700
That would be cool.

511
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:25,220
I think that would be like the perfect, like the biggest fan-pleaser that Square could do.

512
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,340
I know it's cheesy, but what a fan-pleaser.

513
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:30,340
More spoonie Bartness!

514
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,740
Yay!

515
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,540
So that should be cool.

516
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,900
No word yet if it's coming out in America,

517
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:38,540
but Final Fantasy's pretty big here now,

518
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,020
and they put out all the other compilations,

519
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,860
one and two.

520
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:42,680
They can keep putting out, we'll keep taking it.

521
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,960
They'll do, we'll keep buying it.

522
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:46,180
Come on, the micro's coming out soon.

523
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:47,540
We'll buy it.

524
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,660
All right, let's get to tonight's mailbag.

525
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,980
Dark Sakura, got some letters for us?

526
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:53,660
I do indeedy.

527
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,700
All right, if you have letters,

528
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:59,400
send it to our mailbag, togo, T-O-G-O,

529
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,620
at orangelaundryradio.com.

530
00:30:00,620 --> 00:30:05,580
We love getting your feedback dark Sakura who wrote us today Sasuke sent us an email a question

531
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:08,460
We've been asked many many times actually just very recently tonight

532
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:12,540
About how we got our name because he was talking about

533
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:18,060
Orange lounge, you know the group doing boba moga all the bimani stuff

534
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,020
We were sitting on the part one day. Mm-hmm saying, you know, damn it

535
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:26,740
We want to do it internet really is a train in the Bay Area. Yeah, I don't know the Bay Area rapid transit. Yeah

536
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,060
And we just came up with the name because it was Bimani because our show was our three-hour show is Bimani related

537
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,020
And that's how we started off

538
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:34,740
Yeah

539
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:40,980
Originally the focus of the whole station was supposed to be music based games and that's what our three-hour show we do on Sunday night

540
00:30:40,980 --> 00:30:45,840
Is still kind of an homage to but we're branching out. We want to talk about all the games now

541
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:49,640
We're taking our kind of brand and we want to expand, you know, that's what any good business does, right?

542
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,820
So orange lounge was just kind of like, you know, you you like something you name yourself after something related to it

543
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:01,240
So we thought lounge because we kind of lounge around and have that whole Denny's vibe of just sitting around

544
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:06,820
Coffee and just talking about random stuff. That's kind of what we do. So orange lounge just seemed appropriate

545
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:12,200
So we've got an email from one of our longtime listeners Asian buddy Paul. Yes

546
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:16,120
Said I just like to say how much I love the podcast

547
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,140
I used to listen to the live show Sundays, but I can't catch them anymore tier. I so I love it

548
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:23,700
thank you and

549
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:28,340
He just got married on his Ragnarok online private server. So congratulations, I think and

550
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,760
Once no nerd you nerd. Yeah

551
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Married in the online game you nerd

552
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,540
Play one of our cage match winning songs. Oh

553
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:46,100
The cage match we do is part of the three-hour show when we hear the podcast random music and I'd actually answered back saying

554
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:49,340
You know sort of separate this that and the other you run into all those

555
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:53,740
licensing problem because our live station is run through live 365 which

556
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:59,740
pays a lot of licensing fees up front. When it comes to podcasts, can you play

557
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:03,540
copyrighted music and podcasts? It's kind of a big question mark right now because

558
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:07,820
you know it's it's kind of a gray area so we don't do it on this. If you want to

559
00:32:07,820 --> 00:32:12,620
hear tonight's winner it was Destination Blackout from Wengan Midnight Maximum Tune.

560
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:16,340
That's right from Wengan so check that out that'll be on our live station on

561
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,840
on the music show that we did there.

562
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,340
I so kicked Dan's ass in that game.

563
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:19,840
It was great.

564
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:20,840
All right, all right.

565
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,340
Any Marios?

566
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:21,840
Emails?

567
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Yeah, we do.

568
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,840
And I'm just trying to get back to it.

569
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,340
Jaime emailed us.

570
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,840
Our good friend Jaime, who's not Jaime,

571
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,840
sent a link to a game called Dance Praise.

572
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,340
I saw this link.

573
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,340
Oh my gosh.

574
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
So this is Dance Dance Revolution,

575
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:41,840
except it's all Christian music.

576
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,340
DDR God version.

577
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:51,220
It's like they took a bunch of Christian music labels and put it together, made their own

578
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,220
version of DDR.

579
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:58,620
Actually, looking at this now, because for a moment I was thinking, oh, DDR, yay, but

580
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:00,060
it does reverse scrolling.

581
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:03,520
Yeah, it's kind of, well, they have to change it a little bit or they might get sued by

582
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:06,300
Konami just like, you know, the folks who made In the Groove got sued.

583
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:11,180
Honestly, it shows them freaking plan on Konami dance pads.

584
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:13,180
It's a damn StepMania version.

585
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,180
It's StepMania, is all it is at StepMania.

586
00:33:15,180 --> 00:33:19,180
Probably. But, you know, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game,

587
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:25,180
I'd go for it, but I don't see this being the next big thing in dance games.

588
00:33:25,180 --> 00:33:30,180
You know, I chalked this right up there with other classic, um,

589
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:34,180
video games made for retail sales in Christian bookstores.

590
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:35,180
It makes me think of the...

591
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:36,180
The Bible Trivia game.

592
00:33:36,180 --> 00:33:38,180
Yep. The Bible Trivia game and Noah's Ark.

593
00:33:38,180 --> 00:33:44,540
I remember the old pair a DDR parody that had the cross shape controller that had the two down arrows. Oh, yeah

594
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,020
Um, I forgot what that was. That was

595
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:49,580
That was a can stance resurrection

596
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:52,260
That was okay, whatever

597
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:58,580
Want to talk about another bad game? They have the friends trivia game. We've got a cell friends tricky

598
00:33:58,580 --> 00:34:00,580
I think I saw that

599
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:04,780
Here's the here's the best-selling part of it. Hmm it is

600
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:12,780
um all the menus and stuff and the host is played by the really annoying friend

601
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:21,780
dress your character yeah she had nothing to do with friends no no no her

602
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:27,440
her character is not not friend dresser but the character in it I owe the one

603
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,620
who was the girlfriend yeah I can't remember her name I don't watch the show

604
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:35,080
So the one who had the really annoying one the hi

605
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:37,500
Okay

606
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:43,020
Okay, seriously, our listeners are gonna write hate mail for that. Thank you. Hey, I gotta answer it. So all right

607
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:47,500
Anyway, if you know if that's what you're looking for in a dance game go for it

608
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,260
But I don't think the quality of the game since let's face it

609
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:54,720
It is being put out by a much much much much much smaller company

610
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:59,240
I don't think it's going to be that smooth a game, but whatever have fun

611
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:02,320
Well any other emails that it?

612
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:08,560
Other than the one I mentioned from about the controller right, but we've addressed that cool deal all right

613
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,000
We'll send us more mail. We like getting mail right Jamie um yes

614
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:17,480
We do send them send Jamie some email about how much you love her giggling your incessant giggling on this program. I

615
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,160
Am not a giggler

616
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:27,160
ToGo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

617
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,160
I'm giggling now because I keep calling you a giggler

618
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,160
I did find something cool internet related though

619
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,160
Oh what's that?

620
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:33,160
Just a really short thing

621
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:36,160
For folks like me who like to use Firefox

622
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:39,160
There's a skin for it called Pipzilla

623
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:42,160
That makes your top tool bar all fuzzy

624
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,160
And then the background behind your tab is all leopard print

625
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,160
I just thought that people

626
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,160
Where can they download that?

627
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:49,160
Can we put a link on our site somewhere?

628
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:54,880
I'll hunt it down again, but the the font and all the buttons and everything look like they're straight out of the Grand Theft Auto

629
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,520
San Andreas is great cute, and they're all bling-shaped and everything. It's cool cute

630
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:06,960
All right, let's get into some more gaming news. One thing we mentioned earlier in the program was Katamari Damacy

631
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:13,960
There is another Katamari Damacy game on the way. So I really hope this series isn't jumping the shark yet

632
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,840
But I think it's still got some good life left in it

633
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:19,240
it's rolling over the shark and absorbing it into its collective we'll

634
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:24,160
see Famitsu the big gaming magazine in Japan they are reporting boku no

635
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:29,320
watashi no katamari damashi coming out for the PSP so it's gonna be a PSP yours

636
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:36,840
in my katamari I something told me train us to boku no is mine somebody told me

637
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:41,580
it's translate to my my katamari mosh read this three the title again boku no

638
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:48,840
Watashi no Katamari Dimashii. Yeah Mai Mai Katamari. So whatever. Yeah. Boku no is like

639
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:53,840
boy saying. Atashi no is like girl saying. Okay okay. So it's like it sounds like

640
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,160
it's little boys and girls saying are Katamari. Not a whole lot known about

641
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:01,560
this game just yet. Wi-Fi support though is rumored to be in it. Branching

642
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,880
storylines like night and day and other kind of modes like that are gonna be in

643
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:10,360
it so that would be kind of cool to see. So that is rumored that's being shown at

644
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:13,700
Tokyo Game Show. I didn't hear if it was playable or not. I just know it's being shown.

645
00:37:13,700 --> 00:37:17,720
It was. It was playable? Lucky. Yeah, there's actually people

646
00:37:17,720 --> 00:37:21,160
saying that the controls sucked on it.

647
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:26,760
Oh no. Because the... You know it can't be that great. Well, because you can't do dual analogs,

648
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:28,080
so what it is is it's

649
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:31,160
the directional button and the four buttons are the two sticks.

650
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:35,600
I knew it would be like that. And that kinda sucked. Well, the person that was

651
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,620
looking at it was saying that they had hoped that it would have been like the

652
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:43,900
analog and turning with the shoulder buttons, which would be good.

653
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:49,860
It is, from what I remember on the plot for it, is that apparently there's some island

654
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:54,220
that's in trouble that has animals on it or whatever and you have to, you arrive there

655
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:57,820
on a boat or something and you have to save the animals or something by absorbing them

656
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:58,820
in gear.

657
00:37:58,820 --> 00:37:59,820
By rolling them over?

658
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,820
I guess.

659
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,820
Getting them into a star.

660
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:07,420
I guess, I don't know, but that was what I had heard and it was pretty interesting, but

661
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:13,660
But um, I don't know, I'm all for Katamari coming to the PSP so, hell yeah.

662
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,460
Alright um, one other PSP story I definitely want to make sure we cover at some point also

663
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:19,460
being shown at the Tokyo Game Show.

664
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:24,340
You guys know that Suikoden 1 and 2, they are an absolute bitch to find, I mean you

665
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:28,020
could be paying like $100 for a copy of Suikoden 2 on eBay.

666
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,260
Well guess what?

667
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:34,660
They are both coming out, again, together on the PSP, this being announced at the Tokyo

668
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,660
Game Show.

669
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:39,460
Suikoden fans, if you've been dying to play Suikoden 2 for a while, you just can't seem

670
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:44,540
to get a copy of it, it's going to be coming out for the PSP along with Suikoden 1, so

671
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
that's going to be pretty cool.

672
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:50,460
No estimated release on this, but probably not until next year at some point.

673
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:54,280
Again, this is only Japan so far, but heck, why not?

674
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:55,880
Should come out over here too, right?

675
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,180
Just a little bit of translation, right?

676
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,180
We'll see.

677
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,600
Loki, you got some gaming news for us, or, I'm sorry, was something going on in the hack

678
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
and crack scene?

679
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah, couple things actually. The first being that the rumored Team Extender, they're actually

680
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:18,200
creating this video out for the PSP. So you can watch your UMDs and everything on normal

681
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:24,980
TV and they had a demo of it. What this thing does, and it looks like it's a whole case

682
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:30,560
replace of it. You basically unscrew the case and pop this sucker on. It has actually a

683
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:34,660
port to plug in a DualShock controller so you can use that as the controller and then

684
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,660
play your games on the TV that way. You know what's funny is, and this was even just last

685
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:45,980
night, I had gone back after my trip to IKEA and stopped by to see Dan at Gamestop and

686
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:50,180
I was saying, they should make a TV tuner for the PSP. Well, wasn't it rumored that

687
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:56,760
PS3 was going to have a UMD slot in it? That was sort of a rumor but I don't think it's

688
00:39:56,760 --> 00:40:01,960
going to happen. That's what everyone was speculating. It should. It would make sense,

689
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:05,480
but no. I mean, think about it though, especially with the success that they've been having

690
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:08,920
with the movies, which, you know, is kind of odd to me. I mean, I understand why they

691
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,020
put movies on PSP, but I don't see why it's so successful. It would make perfect sense.

692
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:15,200
Because then Sony could like really compete with like DVD, but they would have like their

693
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:20,960
own version. I think it would be very smart to put it in there. I know. Because then they

694
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:27,160
can have it okay, you know, you can, if you buy this version of the movie, not only will

695
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:31,120
you be able to play it on your TV, but you can also take it on the go with you, and,

696
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:34,280
you know, it's kind of, it would be interesting.

697
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,560
It would be smart, but I don't think you're gonna do it.

698
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:41,920
But yeah, so this thing is actually being, I guess, beta'd right now, they're working

699
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:47,760
out the kinks in it, but from the screenshots I've seen it looks good, have selectable widescreen

700
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:52,320
and pan and scan you know if you want to like fill your whole TV but um it should

701
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:58,120
be cool I mean I don't think so but um of course it'll stretch it if you know

702
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:02,820
you try to take it out of widescreen but um you know hey I'm all for modding my

703
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:08,240
PSP so I'm interested about resolution when you get into high into larger

704
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:12,040
high-definition format and how about support for widescreen TVs huh I don't

705
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:16,320
know I'm just saying well here's what it is okay basically if you want to get to

706
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:23,320
the nitty-gritty of this. The PSP already has a video out on it. It's the USB. Because

707
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:29,320
when you're playing your games, the USB acts like a video out. For those of you who are

708
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:33,520
very interested in trying to make one, you probably could. All this thing is is just

709
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:40,520
adding some more support so really that USB port can be exploited to a lot. Anyways, so

710
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:45,360
So other than this... Who said the term nitty-gritty?

711
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,920
I know, and I'm sorry. I instantly started thinking nitty-gritty-driven.

712
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:52,100
The other thing, I was going to say, was it,

713
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:57,080
the site P6, who's doing this kind of a new,

714
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,800
you know, graphic user interface for

715
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,960
the PSP, which looks pretty sexy, but still

716
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,520
working out the kinks on that.

717
00:42:04,520 --> 00:42:07,880
They actually have a tutorial here on how to,

718
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:13,480
If you really want to mod your PSP, you can change all the menus what their, you know,

719
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,480
titles are.

720
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:21,080
So you can make it, you know, like UMD as in, you know, movie player or, you know, your,

721
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,280
you know, system settings as I fucked your mom or something like that, you know.

722
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:30,680
So you can do whatever you want and there's a tutorial on their site and that's pretty

723
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:31,680
interesting.

724
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:37,840
There's a link on PSP updates for that and on our site as well once we put it on there.

725
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:42,120
And yeah, that's pretty much it. There's some really cool Tetris game that came out called

726
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:48,300
Hack and you should check that out too, it looks pretty cool. The link we'll have on

727
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:55,620
our page as well. Oh, oh, and how did I forget this? Ceramic PSPs came out, the white ones.

728
00:42:55,620 --> 00:43:00,640
Don't drop it. Yeah. The new white ones, and they fixed some of the button issues with

729
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:05,240
the bottom buttons, you know, your home and start and stuff. They raised them up so you

730
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,040
you can access them better and they fix the square button problem and I think

731
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:13,980
those are only available in Japan right now but I think they're also over here

732
00:43:13,980 --> 00:43:18,180
pretty soon cool sounds good yeah Dark Sakura what kind of gaming news do you

733
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:23,620
have for us tonight I've got a couple things about Final Fantasy actually

734
00:43:23,620 --> 00:43:28,520
dirge of a service oh cool been trying to hunt down a release date because I

735
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:31,560
I want my Hot Vincent action.

736
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:36,080
And it's speculated the date tentative in Japan

737
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:39,840
is sometime in 2005, no US release date yet.

738
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:40,680
They did however.

739
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:41,880
Which means next summer.

740
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:42,800
Yeah.

741
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,160
But you know, with every Final Fantasy game

742
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,320
that's practically ever been out,

743
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,720
except for like what, four when it came out,

744
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,800
we're gonna get more stuff.

745
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,840
And they're gonna release an international version

746
00:43:51,840 --> 00:43:52,840
and they're gonna get more stuff

747
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:53,880
and I'm gonna have to import it

748
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:55,520
and it's gonna of course be in English.

749
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:58,060
So they better have someone Hot do Vincent's voice.

750
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:06,460
Anyway, um, ooh, could you imagine, um, great, now I can't remember his name, uh, Boreanus.

751
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,460
David Boreanus.

752
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,140
David Boreanus, doing Vincent's voice.

753
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:13,160
He's too busy doing, um, Squall in Kingdom Hearts.

754
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,500
That's almost all already done.

755
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
I know.

756
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:16,500
I'm just saying.

757
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,500
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2, also.

758
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
Whoa.

759
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:19,500
Which I got to play at E3.

760
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:22,380
The nice guy at Boyinavista played a lot of it so I could take pictures, which are on

761
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,900
our website at Orangetownsradio.com.

762
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,300
Hey, hey, blog, blog.

763
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:32,300
Anyway, but they released some of the concept artwork for some of the enemies in the game.

764
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:38,300
The deep ground soldiers who go underground after the meteor incident, we all played Final Fantasy VII.

765
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:42,300
There's a Sahagin, Gargoyle, those are some of the things.

766
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:47,300
And of course, looking at a movie file, which Loki was kind enough to show me,

767
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:54,300
it looks like it's going to be an over-the-shoulder perspective, sort of first-person shooter-y-ish.

768
00:44:54,300 --> 00:44:58,420
but it looked like it actually sort of made me think a little bit like it's

769
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:03,380
like Devil May Cry featuring Vincent mm-hmm sort of the like that that's not

770
00:45:03,380 --> 00:45:07,320
a bad thing no but there better not be any freaking

771
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:14,260
era than a girl scream hate her also speaking about the Final Fantasy 7

772
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,700
franchise was reading an interview from our friends at one up calm mm-hmm with

773
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:26,820
Tetsuya Nomura, who's as we know the director of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final

774
00:45:26,820 --> 00:45:36,540
Fantasy 7 Advent Children, stating that he very much wants to sort of expand on

775
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:41,900
the Final Fantasy 7 tech demo and completely remake the game. I've said this on

776
00:45:41,900 --> 00:45:45,560
previous podcasts, I highly speculate it's already in the works and they're

777
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:49,620
just keeping a real tight lid on it. I think it's gonna be a surprise at next

778
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:57,620
E3 but I I don't know I might be wrong what can you do all we can do is wait

779
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:02,100
but I'll tell you if it's if it's out I know which of those systems I'm getting

780
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:05,780
first mm-hmm that's all there is to that know what else is coming out for the

781
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:11,420
ps3 hmm remake of Gradius oh I heard I had a story cued up on that you're

782
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:17,060
sorry all right no no no it's a wonderful transition into your part even

783
00:46:17,060 --> 00:46:18,060
Even though I have something else.

784
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:19,060
That's alright.

785
00:46:19,060 --> 00:46:20,060
I'll get back to you here.

786
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,060
Let me get the story I have here.

787
00:46:21,060 --> 00:46:25,060
I'll go cry in my little giggling, ditzy corner.

788
00:46:25,060 --> 00:46:26,060
Gradius.

789
00:46:26,060 --> 00:46:33,940
Gradius will be coming out on the PlayStation 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show.

790
00:46:33,940 --> 00:46:37,860
There really isn't a whole lot else to say except Gradius is coming out in a brand new

791
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,900
PlayStation 3 form.

792
00:46:39,900 --> 00:46:41,380
What else is there to say?

793
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,380
It's Gradius.

794
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:43,620
It's PlayStation 3.

795
00:46:43,620 --> 00:46:48,700
It's going to be very sexy, especially if some of the famous Konami musicians, such

796
00:46:48,700 --> 00:46:52,900
as Kiryamoka or some of the other people they have there, are doing the music for it.

797
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,820
It will be very sexy indeed.

798
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:55,820
Sign me up.

799
00:46:55,820 --> 00:46:56,820
Thank you.

800
00:46:56,820 --> 00:46:57,820
Gradius is de-hot.

801
00:46:57,820 --> 00:47:01,060
Alright, that was all I had.

802
00:47:01,060 --> 00:47:05,840
And Jamie, you also said what I was going to on Final Fantasy VII, but that's okay.

803
00:47:05,840 --> 00:47:07,100
I don't mind.

804
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,100
Share the wealth.

805
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,660
Hey, if it's Final Fantasy VII, it's alright.

806
00:47:10,660 --> 00:47:12,560
But if it's Final Fantasy XI, I'll handle it.

807
00:47:12,560 --> 00:47:21,520
can handle the cracks. There's also speculation, according to Bloomberg.com, you know, financial,

808
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:27,960
blah, blah, blah, that Konami and Capcom may be Japan's next big merger. That would be

809
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:36,320
weird. And to quote my, it's so weird saying husband. I'm so married now. But he was saying

810
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:42,380
were they going to be called Capcom? Capcom. Oh, that would just be weird. I don't know.

811
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:47,980
Those I don't see it happening. I don't either but a lot of these companies to do a quote in here

812
00:47:48,620 --> 00:47:50,060
from a

813
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:52,060
Takashi, oh yeah, who's an analyst with

814
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,660
joint securities in Tokyo

815
00:47:54,660 --> 00:48:00,140
So companies like Taito Bandai and Namco are not merging because they are facing the financial ruin

816
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:03,980
They're looking three years down the road and thinking this might be a strategic choice

817
00:48:04,140 --> 00:48:10,460
Hmm, and if these big you know because Taito Namco all those are really freaking huge

818
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:17,060
I know it's so weird that all these game companies are suddenly like it's like we have they're forming into the giant mechatron

819
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,060
we have Sega Sammy and

820
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:24,820
Which is weird all in itself, but be very few, but I mean honestly

821
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:29,440
You're taking your fourth largest and sixth largest video game manufacturer

822
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:37,120
Mm-hmm and think of how big that's gonna be huge be huge and both of them have very popular franchises to neither make a man

823
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:43,600
Castlevania no I mean we might get DDR with Mega Man who knows be interesting

824
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:47,300
I know the weird thing is when I read this story I didn't read it on

825
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:50,820
Bloomberg.com I read it on a gaming site that was referring to that article I

826
00:48:50,820 --> 00:48:56,740
interpreted it as Konami and Capcom were both looking to acquire new companies I

827
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,020
didn't quite get that at first that they were looking to acquire each other I

828
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,540
think that would be kind of weird there's another comment in here that

829
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:07,220
sort of bugged me. I'm just gonna read this little paragraph here.

830
00:49:07,220 --> 00:49:11,940
What's that? Konami is trying to break its reliance on the video game business,

831
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:16,100
where earnings depend on hit titles, and find new revenue sources by expanding

832
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:19,780
into toys, sports club, arcade machinery, and casino businesses.

833
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:24,980
Which actually, you know, I saw a number of Konami-made

834
00:49:24,980 --> 00:49:30,740
slot machines when I was at the casino a couple weekends ago from my

835
00:49:30,740 --> 00:49:36,500
my honeymoon. And Konami has always been into fitness equipment. I mean, they're

836
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:43,860
even working on a mock-up of DDR to be used as a fitness, as a basically

837
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:46,940
automated aerobics machine. Right. It's been a few months since we've heard

838
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:50,020
anything on that. I wonder if that ever came out or what. I saw the mock-up on it

839
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,460
and there's there's another one I want to read here too, a quote by Yuta

840
00:49:54,460 --> 00:50:00,660
Sakurai, who's an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. Konami

841
00:50:00,660 --> 00:50:04,540
which took a break after three years of aggressive expansion is now back into

842
00:50:04,540 --> 00:50:09,220
attack mode possibly reviving their acquisition plans consolidation is

843
00:50:09,220 --> 00:50:12,500
gaining pace and music movie broadcasting companies that internet

844
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:18,180
portals are possible partners hmm so yeah looking at this from the business

845
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:24,980
side that actually does make a lot of sense and it's it's saying on here that

846
00:50:24,980 --> 00:50:30,880
speculated target for Konami is Capcom. Interesting. Right now, Konami is number

847
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,920
four, Capcom is number six. It makes financial sense. All right. See what happens.

848
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:40,100
That would be kind of... just be weird. We'll see though. We'll see. That would be like

849
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:46,080
taking my heart and breaking it in two and putting it back together. Why? Because I

850
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:51,880
love Konami and I love Capcom and seeing, you know, it's like having... it's like

851
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,560
Like having hamsters, you know how if one of your hamsters feels like it's threatened,

852
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:02,520
its babies are threatened, its assets are threatened, it's gonna go kill the other hamster

853
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,520
and eat it.

854
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:04,520
It's true!

855
00:51:04,520 --> 00:51:05,520
Hamsters do that!

856
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:06,520
I know, I know.

857
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:15,440
It's not the best analogy, but you know, it's dog eat dog in this case.

858
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,080
Hamster eat hamster?

859
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:18,720
Hamster eat hamster.

860
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:19,720
Alright.

861
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:21,720
Anything else for us, DarkSakura?

862
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:25,480
No, all right. I like fire. I know you do

863
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:30,080
I know you do you like to do, but that that's when you truly giggle is when you set things on fire

864
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:32,560
Oh, yeah, all right, but only when they scream

865
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,720
Zeno saga

866
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:39,580
Zeno saga is coming out to the Nintendo TS

867
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:45,540
Zeno saga one and two specifically no it's not going to be the full-blown

868
00:51:45,540 --> 00:51:51,420
3D movie element that you see in Xenosaga. No, they're gonna redo it all

869
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:57,020
cutesy anime style in a 2D isometric type style, but still, that's kind of cool.

870
00:51:57,020 --> 00:52:00,660
I mean, to remake a game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and just kind of like

871
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:04,500
remake all the graphics and all the stuff behind it, and it's still gonna

872
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,540
have cutscenes, it's just gonna be done differently. Well, they're gonna remake

873
00:52:07,540 --> 00:52:13,180
that into a DS title, Xenosaga 1 & 2, that also coming out of Tokyo Game Show

874
00:52:13,180 --> 00:52:18,700
from Monolith Soft. Should be very interesting. Xenosaga episode 3, by the way, is coming

875
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:24,980
out for the Playstation 2, if you were not aware. Alright. Loki, did you have anything

876
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:28,180
else for us tonight? I saw you had a story up there, so I'm curious.

877
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:33,900
I'm just looking at some of the stuff that they've been showing at, you know, Tokyo Game

878
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:39,980
Show. Just some of the new games that look really awesome. For example, they were kind

879
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:46,420
showing some of the high res pictures from some of the tech demos we saw at E3 like Motorstorm

880
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,060
which looks freaking awesome, it's like burnout meets off-road racing.

881
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:56,580
My favorite though is just some of the detailed shots that they've been showing for Metal

882
00:52:56,580 --> 00:53:01,360
Gear Solid 4, just the amount of detail that's in this is incredible.

883
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:08,440
The other game that looks really cool is the, what was it, Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.

884
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,800
Some of the stuff in there actually looks like CNN footage.

885
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,920
That's how detailed it is.

886
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,600
And also, what really scares me is they're talking about making it a little in the dark

887
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:24,400
for the PS3, so that might give Ooey Bowl some inspiration to make another movie.

888
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:28,000
We can't have that, so I hope not.

889
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,000
Yeah.

890
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:30,000
Alright.

891
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,320
I got one more story for you guys tonight then.

892
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:33,320
It's a brand new piece.

893
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,720
This is usually the type of thing you talk about, Loki, but I'm stealing this from you

894
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,280
tonight.

895
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:46,060
video via your PSP. A company called Hori is making a brand new PSP accessory. Basically

896
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:50,060
what it is, it's a little rectangle looking device and what it does is you can hook it

897
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:55,940
up so that you can record video straight onto your memory stick. So that's pretty much it.

898
00:53:55,940 --> 00:54:01,380
You can record video using your PSP right onto your memory stick. About $115 is what

899
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:06,260
it's going to cost. That's 12,800 yen coming out in November in Japan.

900
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:12,140
that I think about, I think it was Hori that made those GameCube pads that I

901
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:16,040
have that are like the Super Nintendo ones. Oh. But I mean, a lot of this, you know, I

902
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,300
think that's going to be actually a really good product. A lot of the stuff

903
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:21,800
that they put out was pretty good. No word yet though if that's going to come

904
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:25,180
out in the U.S., so you guys may have to import that device if that sounds

905
00:54:25,180 --> 00:54:29,700
interesting to you, wanting to record your own homemade movies on PSP. But

906
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:34,000
remember, if you're making adult films with your PSP, don't leave it where

907
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,540
people are going to find it because they'll get put all over the internet

908
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:42,340
like you know the celebrities like Pam Anderson and stuff. On that note that's

909
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,420
going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go. Thank you guys

910
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:49,840
so much for tuning in, subscribing to us. Tell somebody you know and you love

911
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:53,220
about Orange Lounge Radio and and help spread the word. In fact, tell somebody

912
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:59,020
you hate about Orange Lounge Radio. TEEHEE, TEEHEE, insert bad joke here. That's right.

913
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:05,200
and a reminder to check orange launch radio.com and check out our Hurricane

914
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:08,280
Katrina relief we're doing with the other Sacramento companies Dark Records

915
00:55:08,280 --> 00:55:14,320
and Club 21 and we'll see you guys next time here on the podcast final thoughts

916
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:21,040
Loki there's a funny website Rockstar made to kind of hit back at Jack

917
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:28,040
Thompson. It's called Citizens United Negating Technology dot org. And for those that aren't

918
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,120
too witty out there, that would be the acronym CUNT.

919
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,640
Thank you. Thank you for that.

920
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:42,440
And it's quite funny. It's basically a parody of, you know, just the Jack Thompson argument

921
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:49,040
and the first thing that pops up is, welcome to our site, turn off the internet. It's funny.

922
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:55,880
There's a whole bunch of emails or fake emails I should say that are on the Liberty City

923
00:55:55,880 --> 00:56:00,440
Stories webpage so go check those out as well.

924
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:05,120
My final thought is I'm still craving a milkshake now that you both had them during the three

925
00:56:05,120 --> 00:56:07,320
hour program earlier this evening and I didn't.

926
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:10,280
I'm suffering before it comforts you.

927
00:56:10,280 --> 00:56:11,280
Not really.

928
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:12,280
Not really.

929
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,280
Darkstalker, your final thought.

930
00:56:13,280 --> 00:56:15,040
Two sort of final thoughts.

931
00:56:15,040 --> 00:56:16,420
I'm correcting myself.

932
00:56:16,420 --> 00:56:22,860
It wasn't police knots that had the mini RC lookin' metal gear like Otacon was using.

933
00:56:22,860 --> 00:56:28,300
It was Snatcher, which is another Kojima game that was on Sega CD.

934
00:56:28,300 --> 00:56:30,220
Good luck finding it.

935
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,260
And your second final thought?

936
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:32,260
Reject false icons.

937
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:33,260
Of course.

938
00:56:33,260 --> 00:56:35,500
I'm gonna go ditz my way off now.

939
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:41,320
Alright, have fun with that, and from us to you, have a great day, afternoon or evening

940
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,100
whenever you're listening to this, and we'll see you next time on Orange Lawn's Radio To

941
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:45,100
Go.

942
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:50,900
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition. This podcast is a

943
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:56,740
proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com. See you next update!
