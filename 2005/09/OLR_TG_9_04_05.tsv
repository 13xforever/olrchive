390	3031	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of September 5th, 2005.
3271	13734	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14034	17556	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
19056	28199	Hello, everybody, and welcome to another episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go, your home for discussion and news and all that stuff.
28777	36119	on video games that don't suck, but sometimes we have to talk about video games that do suck, just to tell you to avoid them, and I know I plan to do that tonight.
36759	40760	With me, say hello to the one and only DarkSakura, back from a brief absence.
41060	41460	Hi.
41680	42320	How are you doing?
43400	44041	I'm married.
44621	46321	You are married, congratulations.
46461	52222	Thank you, I'm actually in the middle of my honeymoon, but I decided to take some time out and say hi.
52582	53503	Now that's some dedication.
53523	54723	I got me some bling.
55759	56459	Congratulations.
56759	59080	It's platinum and gold and expensive.
59360	61841	I think we're going to put a picture of the ring on the website for those people who were asking.
61861	63762	Yeah, but don't put one of me on there.
64242	65182	Oh, I know.
65202	66343	Your face remains a mystery.
66363	70584	Although if they look very carefully at the album art, there's a little picture of DarkSakura in the corner.
71205	74826	Yeah, and it's like an overhead shot because I was holding my phone up that way.
74846	75366	It's an artsy shot.
75426	76267	It's an artsy shot.
76407	79668	It's because I was taking a picture of myself with my phone because I'm so vain.
81737	86002	Also say hello to the one and only Loki.
86803	87123	Hi.
87363	91587	By the way, we're on our fourth take tonight because we got a case of the giggles, but we're trying to get through it this time.
91608	92569	I had a case of the Guinness.
93189	99556	That would happen being that we are having a little bit of alcohol because there is a holiday weekend.
99776	103560	Yes, it's Labor Day weekend, so we were doing a little bit of drinking for our live show tonight, except...
103960	109726	Thanks to Technical Difficulties Live 365, our live show didn't happen, so we've just been enjoying some drinks.
110707	111828	Yeah, technically they suck.
111928	114250	Yeah, well, the ferret has something to say about that.
114270	114711	Oh, what's that?
115572	115852	Thank you.
117034	119316	We have a podcast guest tonight.
119356	123619	We don't allow guests on the show very often, so this guest is very, very extra special.
123939	126421	First rule of podcasts is do not talk about podcasts.
127262	129324	Say hello to Mel B is here tonight.
129744	132886	Greetings, everybody, from the only sober one in this room so far.
133006	133767	How you doing, Mel?
134327	136049	I'm doing pretty good, actually.
136769	140272	For those that may not know you, why are you an internet celebrity?
140292	142274	We're going to make all our podcast guests say this now.
142314	143575	Why are you an internet celebrity?
144355	161466	Wow, I guess it happened, oh, about five years ago when someone clicked on a link on a DDR site and saw a video of me dancing, and, like, this is back when Dance Dance Revolution had a freestyle and people were in the community and doing fun things and trying new things, and...
161986	162567	Thanks for watching!
179850	180371	Thanks for watching!
194867	195107	XBOX Ver.
214676	223682	Both in Ultramix and Ultramix 2 Did some stuff for Extreme and among other things Very cool, and any other game companies that you've had experience with?
224403	242016	I had a cup of coffee with Namco for a couple months And that's really about it Right now I'm not working in the game industry But I'd definitely like to be back later So for a lot of our podcast listeners out there who listen to this They live all over the world What's it like to work on the inside, working for the game company?
243351	248312	It's kind of like almost any other job that, you know, you kind of always dream about working.
248352	252313	You know, it's like anytime you hear a video game test and you think, wow, I get to play with games all day long.
252333	253553	That must be the most kickback job.
254173	257113	And to the most extent, yes, it is a pretty kickback job.
257174	263775	You know, it's like you get paid to do something you do pretty much, you know, something that you do at home sitting on your ass getting paid nothing, you know.
264255	267715	But it's, as with any job, there are positives and negatives.
267775	271276	Negatives is, man, if you're like, say, a big fan of one game,
271916	276559	Playing it 40 hours a week for 8 weeks straight, you're going to learn to not like it as much.
276579	279981	So you get a little burned out on DDR after playing it so much.
280381	281641	Yeah, you do.
281681	286224	There's just whole other types of things, especially when you work in quality assurance.
286284	291267	But with any other job, QA is sort of like you're the grunt of the company.
291367	294949	A lot of people go into that thinking, oh, I can become a developer of it or a producer.
295289	296249	And in some cases, you can.
296309	297470	It just depends on the company.
297530	300912	I mean, if it's a really huge company, it's like you're one of like
302321	305203	250, 300 people that are trying to jump ahead and make that next step.
305523	308905	But if you're in a smaller company, chances are you do have a shot at making it.
309326	312868	So I'm not by no means discouraging anyone from doing anything.
312908	314209	I mean, just do what you like.
314289	315409	And I like doing what I did.
315429	316190	I have no regrets.
316270	318031	And like I said, I'd like to be back sometime.
318391	319112	All right, very cool.
319452	322294	Any quick advice for somebody that wants to get their foot in the door in the game industry?
322935	326197	It's really not that hard to get into testing, really.
326237	328399	Essentially, you just go onto corporate websites.
328459	337967	If you have a gaming company around in your area, especially whether you're in the Bay Area of California or you're in Southern California or Florida or some places, just check out the corporate sites.
338047	338928	Just get into testing.
338968	339188	I mean...
339928	343470	When you're going to the job interview, just let them know, especially on your resume and stuff.
343910	346111	List down every single console that you've played.
346471	348331	Talk about the types of games you are interested in.
348472	352233	Talk about games that you mastered.
352253	357075	Because people like to know, wow, there's probably some hidden things that you found out that we thought no one else would.
357495	373649	and then you do you just learn basically that being a tester isn't just playing games it's you're trying to break the game more than anything so you have to do all sorts of crazy stuff like if you're playing a racing game you have to try driving backwards and see if you could crash the game because that's what you're paid to do you're paid to break the game
374246	375167	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
395868	397289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
413897	415959	Yeah, as in from XL Saga.
417980	419982	Who seems like a fairly well-behaved doggy so far.
421623	427368	As far as other games, they're ones I can't really talk about on air, so I'm going to leave those alone.
427388	432853	Oh yeah, and we are probably within the next couple weeks going to be starting up on World of Warcraft.
433693	434394	Oh boy, okay.
434414	436996	Well, we need somebody from this show to be in there to give us updates, so...
437560	438461	Yep.
438981	444546	I'm going to play an undead rogue or a priest.
444626	445806	Undead priest, undead rogue.
446687	449850	Or I'm going to be playing a night elf hunter on another server.
449890	451471	Haven't made a decision yet, huh?
451551	454834	I hear that their expansion that they're doing for World of Warcraft, it's free.
455674	456115	Oh, interesting.
456135	456735	Downloadable.
457295	462980	Because they figured that the users, they're giving them a little kickback because they paid enough.
463596	464376	Wow.
465897	468098	Square Enix needs a hint here.
468138	471820	And also, though, with your first month of World of Warcraft, you do pay nothing.
472700	475261	Well, yeah, a lot of MMOs do that, though.
475622	477502	Ragnarok doesn't, bastards.
478003	478503	F Ragnarok.
479904	481024	So, huh?
481144	484466	They give you the first one free because, you know, it's like any other drug dealer, man.
484706	486866	They give you that first hit for, you know, a discount price.
487126	487987	Then you got to come back.
488267	489307	Then they know there's demand.
489427	490588	Then, you know, they got you.
490808	491488	That's right.
491548	494529	It's like get you hooked on, you know, get your first dose of heroin's free.
495600	495940	The puppies!
496421	496761	The puppies!
496781	497341	My dog is retarded.
497361	497421	I'm...
515717	519400	I gave him the lay down command, sounds too much like sit down.
519820	521781	So when I tell him to sit down, he lays down.
522282	524904	Although I renamed the rollover to play dead.
525404	527745	So he sticks his legs in the air, his little stub legs.
528166	530407	He is excellent when it comes to the frisbee though.
530607	531628	He makes me lots of money.
532309	534130	So would you recommend the game to somebody else?
535010	535231	Yes.
536391	536792	Why?
537552	538533	Because of the bees.
539813	540794	The cuteness factor.
540934	542136	You have to feed your puppies.
542957	545960	You have to bathe your puppies, and you have to pet your puppies, and you have to take them for a walk.
546340	547782	And remember to clean up their crap!
548102	550826	Is Nintendogs as annoying as the Tamagotchi?
551747	553949	Tamagotchi was really stupid.
554390	555451	I have a Digimon still.
555471	556612	I have an old school Digimon.
556672	558034	Why is Nintendogs not stupid?
558550	561132	Because they don't look like little digital blips on the screen.
561592	571958	Your puppy likes you too, and he jumps, and he plays bone, he plays frisbee, and he throws frisbee, like, well shit, you just threw it away, why should I, okay here.
573279	574540	So they got a lot of personality.
574800	575420	He's a puppy.
575760	576061	Alright.
577241	578362	Loki, what have you been playing this week?
578720	582862	I like throwing the bark ball at my Nintendog because it's afraid of it.
583642	587584	It reminds me so much of my mom's dog because my mom's Chihuahua is afraid of everything.
587984	590265	I hit my puppy in the head the first time with the bark ball.
591765	594647	And I went like that.
595467	602270	I've been playing a lot, a lot of stuff because we actually have 19 game publishers come out to my work for some little conference thing.
602430	604871	So it was like E3 coming to me.
605325	605965	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
635198	640243	Classic games, if I'm really bored, maybe, but I'm not too big a fan of that.
640343	645148	I did like, however, you did the PSP game send for me.
645188	645728	Game sharing.
645768	646449	Okay, game sharing.
646769	650813	You did the game sharing feature for me so I could play the little demos.
651113	655577	I was a little disappointed that they were only first round demos, but there were a heck of a lot of demos on there.
656118	660662	You know, Dig Dug, Rally X. Now, granted, it's the same game from the 80s, but still...
661122	664505	to be able for you to send those to me for free was kind of neat.
664525	671611	You know, there was a lot of games on there, and they did also, they have these arrangement games, four different arrangement games, which are kind of updated graphics.
671671	673733	It's almost like the game is remade, which was really cool.
673753	674374	Those are really cool.
674934	678237	And Rally-X Arrangement, that's the only place you can play Rally-X Arrangement.
678257	679718	That's one of my favorite arrangement games they ever did.
679859	685984	Yeah, and I think that they're actually, they have the Rally-X and they have New Rally-X, which I think New Rally-X is the one that was on the Ridge Racer series.
686995	688157	New RallyX is there.
688177	689178	There's really no difference.
689258	690179	RallyX arrangements work.
690199	692783	But yeah, okay, so anyways, it was really cool.
693464	696868	And then I also, I have DeathJr, but I haven't gotten to play it yet.
697308	700993	Looks cool, just, you know, hopefully this time I can hear the sound, unlike E3.
701013	701073	Um...
703024	703384	DarkSakura.com
733156	736935	What's great about it is you can actually do the crash breaker where you make your car explode.
737816	738456	Every Time I Crash.
738916	739376	I love that.
739396	740357	That's fucking awesome.
740997	743878	And plus there's jumps and it's a lot faster, so it's really cool.
744798	747899	Then on top of that, I played actually with my DS a little bit because I got some more games.
747919	750000	I got Pack and Roll, which was really interesting.
750020	751360	I love Pack and Roll.
751420	756682	It's not really my thing, but it's a lot better than Pack Picks, that's for sure, because that game kind of sucked.
756702	757842	Pack Picks was awesome!
758102	764084	Anyways, so then I also played the DS version of Star Wars Episode 3, and that was actually pretty cool.
764824	766505	It looked like a really good Super Nintendo game.
766565	767425	That's what it reminded me of.
768774	770236	What's the DS feature in that game?
770996	772017	What's the dual screen?
772037	773719	In some of the stuff, it's just the status screen.
773739	778943	In other ones, you can use it for the flight sim parts and stuff like that.
779864	782787	It's mainly they don't really use the touchscreen stuff that much, but...
783673	784093	That's fine.
784293	785774	I've said this on a previous episode.
786034	788275	You don't have to whore the touch thing in every game.
788696	789996	The dual screen thing is fine.
790036	791217	I mean, make use of that.
792017	793378	Some other things I was going to mention, though.
794438	799301	At the conferencing, they were talking about the game coming out from Konami, Lost in Blue.
799701	802242	They're doing a lot of things with the DS that fucking rock.
802722	805403	For example, there's one part where you have to make fire.
805724	809525	You take the stylus and you rub it between your hands like it's a stick.
810426	812727	And like you're rubbing sticks together to make fire.
813240	813861	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
834835	847557	Seeing Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfire, Tom Clancy's new game Fucking looks sexy I don't even like first person shooters, but oh my god does that look sexy What was that insider info you were telling me about 360 before the show?
847937	861480	Oh, 360, a few things They're only shipping 700,000 to 1 million units at launch So, you know, that's why you get those pre-orders You heard it here first Yeah, I mean, that's not really known
862387	866052	and for backwards compatibility, you have to have the hard drive.
867213	869476	No hard drive, no playing the old games.
869697	870357	Interesting.
870818	872440	I have not read that anywhere.
873321	874042	Interesting.
874062	875785	They've got some information out there.
876085	880571	Also, it's only going to support a few games at launch and they're going to be adding more every two weeks.
881092	883213	Why do you have to have the hard drive for backwards compatibility?
883553	884153	I don't know.
884373	886833	Oh, because the emulator is going to be on the drive, right?
887033	887454	Is that what it is?
887494	888134	Something like that.
888154	888754	Mel thinks he knows.
888794	889174	What's going on?
889194	894955	Well, essentially, the way they have to reverse, you know, play backwards compatibility is they have to have software for it.
895295	898056	And their thing is they haven't officially finished it out yet.
898436	900177	So the thing is you're going to have to have the hard drive available.
900217	903618	So when it's ready, then, you know, you can download it or whatever.
903658	904658	I'm not sure how it works.
905458	906078	Interesting.
906118	909179	Yeah, because it's not basically the backwards thing hasn't been finished yet.
909399	909519	Hmm.
910265	914907	If you think about the Xbox Live Silver that they're talking about, you're like, oh, I can play some online games.
915027	915187	Nope.
915467	915867	Think again.
915887	916788	You've got to buy the Xbox Live.
916868	918448	I'm going to get to a story about that in a little bit.
918488	919368	Okay, so we've got that.
920149	923510	There's another thing that they're adding with Xbox Live that's really cool, Spectator Mode.
923770	927632	So, for example, they're doing the Madden Challenge with the new next-gen Madden game.
928012	932533	You can go in, watch the game, watch them as a spectator, watch people play.
932834	934394	You can have racing games, everything.
934454	936575	So that's a new thing that they have, Spectator Mode on that.
937895	960924	and the webcam sounds good as far as my gaming week I haven't played a whole lot of new games I did go out and do some impulse buys the other day I was at Fry's which is like this huge electronics store here that sells a lot of games and they have a lot of cheap games so I was looking through their $20 games I picked up Namco 50th Anniversary Collection because it was only $15 and the Namco 50th Anniversary Collection has like 14 old Namco games in it Pac-Man, Ms.
960964	965406	Pac-Man and this is the one where I was talking about a few weeks on the show has licensed music in it
965666	967787	Like it has Dexys Midnight Runners, Come On Eileen.
968127	970868	It has She Drives Me Crazy, like all those songs.
971168	974429	Okay, Namco 50th Anniversary Collection sucks.
975110	976370	I do not recommend this game.
976610	978871	I'm sorry to say, I love Namco.
979231	981612	This collection sucks balls.
981992	982913	And the reason why...
983885	988328	They've done this before, many times, on PlayStation 1 and current gen.
988488	989408	They've already done this.
989548	990709	Granted, there's a couple of new games here.
990729	991209	There's one on the PSP.
1001295	1002155	King and the Balloon
1017967	1024860	Granted, I will give Namco credit because they didn't advertise this on the box that it had 80s music, but you don't have it during the actual game.
1025201	1028106	The only time you hear this is in the menu.
1028587	1029028	That's it.
1029529	1030772	So when you go into the actual game...
1031761	1032381	There's no music.
1032642	1032922	Nothing.
1032962	1041167	Yeah, it actually did the same thing for the Activision Collection, because there was cool 80s music in the menu screens, but when you play, it's still blip.
1041348	1042408	That's boring to me.
1042748	1047251	There wasn't really... The arranged games were not nowhere to be seen.
1047952	1049153	There were a couple unlocks.
1049233	1051494	I just think there's so much more that could have been done with this.
1052035	1053115	Midway Collections.
1053476	1054116	Great stuff.
1054656	1055737	Online ranking boards.
1056017	1057158	Xbox Live Aware.
1057759	1057839	Um...
1058985	1059806	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1074113	1083366	If you do not own any of these previous Namco collections, I suppose this is a place to start because these are some important games that are good and you should have in your collection.
1083687	1085770	But honestly, I don't recommend this game.
1085850	1088634	Even if you're a fan of classic gaming, get the other Namco collections.
1088694	1089074	They're better.
1089094	1090096	This one is not good.
1090516	1091817	by the Namco Battle Collection.
1091878	1092298	Absolutely.
1092738	1094320	Now, the Namco Battle Collection is cool.
1095181	1096642	It's got the arranged versions in it.
1096722	1097823	It's got the game beaming.
1097863	1098484	Multiplayer.
1098624	1101927	I think it works better on a handheld than it does on a console.
1102368	1104310	If you are interested in this, go get the PSP version.
1104370	1105591	Do not buy the Xbox.
1105611	1113398	The other thing, too, is if the monitors were vertical or whatever, you can adjust the orientation so that the monitors are taller and stuff on there.
1114019	1114760	It's just really awesome.
1115200	1115480	Cool.
1115940	1117981	I did actually play other Konami games this weekend.
1118141	1118441	What's that?
1118701	1120481	Well, Dan and I went to the casino.
1120501	1122281	I played Slot Machine.
1122301	1122741	Oh, okay.
1122781	1123802	So you played Slot Machine.
1123862	1125562	Hey, he lost a dollar and I made 12.
1127302	1128042	What else did I play?
1128302	1135084	I bought .hack part one because all of a sudden I'm like, even though there's four parts, I'm like, I want to get into the .hack games again because I played them a little bit.
1135104	1141365	And they're faux MMOs where the plot is that it's an MMORPG, but it's not really an MMORPG.
1141545	1142465	You should watch the anime.
1142965	1143305	Rob, what?
1165828	1167289	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1187443	1188424	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1210652	1213574	I have Nedcons and Jogcons and Erskinecons.
1213594	1214335	We have lots of listeners.
1214355	1214795	Send me free games.
1214835	1215856	I'm glad you mentioned that.
1215936	1218838	We do have game companies that will be listening to us thanks to me.
1219178	1220939	Because I have a lot of press kits.
1220959	1223160	Hi, game companies!
1223220	1224081	Hi!
1224181	1229445	Apparently EA does listen to... There's one guy at EA that listens to gaming podcasts.
1229625	1230025	Not us.
1230505	1231106	Which made me sad.
1231726	1233787	Was it because we kind of talk shit about Madden?
1233848	1234368	No.
1234928	1236009	We don't talk shit about Madden.
1236049	1236789	I just don't like Madden.
1237050	1237810	I like Burnout.
1237950	1239611	I talk much about Burnout, okay?
1240232	1240472	Anyways.
1241173	1245256	I seem to remember reviewing Battlefield 2 and my review was something along the lines of, what's the big idea?
1265117	1266719	DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen
1290456	1294179	Um, played a lot of Quackshot on Genesis, actually.
1294519	1296200	What made you decide to go to Genesis?
1296481	1315995	Um, well, actually, it was the Classic Gaming Expo about two weeks ago, and so I checked it out, and you know, always going into retro stuff, and just, um, because my girlfriend had just pulled out her, um, CDX, actually, because she was into Sega CD at the time when we were just trying to basically get all our old gaming systems up on the TV going, and
1316155	1316736	DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
1335155	1338518	At the time, my 16-bit was a huge deal back then, you know?
1338798	1339099	Oh, yeah.
1339119	1339439	Oh, yeah.
1339459	1339779	I remember.
1339839	1345024	Did you see the guy that was making the portable systems, the custom portable systems at Classic GameX?
1345044	1345284	Oh, yes.
1345344	1346105	He's supposed to be there.
1346365	1346625	Yes.
1347046	1347566	I did see him.
1347586	1349968	He's doing Dreamcast portable systems now.
1350128	1350749	Oh, very cool.
1351289	1351530	Very cool.
1352515	1352815	All right.
1353416	1353796	Anything else?
1354477	1362124	See, besides that, I was playing a lot of old EA sports, which are called Lakers vs. Celtics, Madden 93 back then.
1362144	1365468	But as far as more current games, I actually was...
1366215	1367116	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1390288	1390549	DanSummit2001
1404850	1408192	Alright, that was just a huge step back for Enix at the time.
1408712	1412315	Goodness, because it was like, I don't know why they ruined a franchise like that.
1412335	1416797	Because the first two games were awesome.
1416817	1419199	You had personalities, you had characters people got attached to.
1419239	1420880	The music was great.
1420900	1424022	The first one had great novelty type songs that would fit a video game.
1424042	1426463	But the second one, they did some really great production.
1426503	1429225	They had guys from like... AVEX?
1429305	1431066	Yeah, AVEX, Earth, Wind & Fire.
1431366	1433668	Maurice White, he did Hero Kun's theme.
1433688	1434168	So it was like...
1434989	1445341	This was something you could actually legitimately hear as mainstream pop radio, and then the third one totally took a step backwards, and everything you knew about the game and loved about the game was gone.
1445421	1450206	You know, I think Square and Enix, now that they've merged, they should do a...
1451647	1455388	They should do, like, a Final Fantasy dancing game with the bus.
1455428	1455928	No, I'm kidding.
1455948	1456529	It would be horrible.
1456609	1458389	Hey, I actually liked Dance Summit.
1459069	1459229	Really?
1459249	1459790	Honestly enough.
1460490	1464051	But, you know, I was... Marty Swite also did anime stuff, too.
1464591	1467992	He did the Gatchaman anime, so I was like, the second one's my favorite of the bunch.
1468492	1470173	But I did really like the third one.
1470213	1472493	It had a very innovative idea and a special controller.
1473234	1477675	It made me think of the old ColecoVision joystick one with the little four buttons on it.
1478953	1479253	DarkSakura
1503484	1504325	Here's your advice column.
1504345	1506306	What are you going to tell the kids about tonight?
1506866	1510608	If you're on your honeymoon, don't go do your podcast because you never know when you're going to leave.
1511168	1511388	No.
1512109	1515271	Today's bit of advice is how to survive in a plummeting elevator.
1516331	1518372	Elevators have numerous safety features.
1519033	1523015	There have been very few recorded incidents involving death from plummeting elevators.
1523515	1529859	In general, it is highly unlikely for a cable, also called traction elevator, to fall all the way to the bottom of the shaft.
1531829	1532670	I said chapped.
1533611	1541496	Moreover, the compressed air column in the elevator hoistway and the car buffers at the bottom of the hoistway may keep the forces of the impact survivable.
1542376	1545378	Number one, flatten your body against the car floor.
1545839	1549781	This should distribute the force of the impact rather than concentrate it on one area of your body.
1549841	1551502	Standing may be difficult anyway.
1551602	1552463	I would have never thought of that.
1552963	1557006	Number two, cover your face and head to prevent them from sealing parts that may break loose.
1557935	1560456	But my final piece of advice... Take the stairs, fat ass.
1560536	1561757	Take the fucking stairs!
1563258	1567720	And on that note, I will go ahead and give my final word of the show.
1568080	1568640	Yes, honey.
1568820	1572482	Which is reject false icons and don't chug Guinness.
1573343	1573603	Alright.
1574043	1577265	Thank you, DarkSakura, for being here and have a good one.
1578365	1579806	Congratulations once again on getting hitched.
1582401	1584082	Let's get into some gaming news tonight.
1585162	1588784	Started off with the Xbox 360, Xbox Live 2.0.
1589645	1590745	The details are out.
1590865	1606433	And yes, if you have a silver subscription to Xbox Live, you will be able to download game trailers, demos of upcoming games, episode style content, and you can create a profile, leave voice messages for other live Xbox gamers.
1606713	1610775	The one thing you won't be able to do, however, is play games head-to-head.
1611297	1614495	Sorry, you will have to have a gold membership in order to do that.
1615279	1623985	Gold Membership, $7.99 a month for a one-month subscription card, but they do have other ideas as well.
1624005	1631770	$19.99 for a three-month option, and let's see, I believe it's $49.99 for a 12-month subscription card.
1632170	1638735	You want the kit that comes with the headset and all that stuff, it's approximately $20 more depending on what you get.
1638755	1645019	They're saying that there's a headset pack, it's a three-month set, $10 rebate card on the game,
1645579	1648141	and Joust from Xbox Live Arcade, $39.99.
1649802	1651863	Joust?
1652143	1652644	Joust.
1653524	1654405	Woohoo!
1654445	1655105	Joust!
1655285	1656766	Hey, Joust was a rad game.
1657967	1659848	Yeah, like in the 80s.
1660489	1660929	Seriously.
1660949	1664732	You know, you run around with lances and you steal people's egos, you know?
1665792	1666653	Lego my ego.
1666673	1667974	That was Joust.
1668474	1669094	Oh, God.
1669435	1674498	So, those of you guys that were hoping that the silver subscription would allow you to play some games, sorry.
1674518	1674678	Sorry.
1676440	1676861	Exactly.
1676901	1679483	That whole core system is a joke anyways.
1679543	1682646	I mean, it's like, yeah, here's this Xbox.
1682706	1686330	It looks pretty, but you can't do anything with it until you buy the rest.
1686850	1694458	If you're listening to this show, you're a hardcore enough gamer where if you're going to be buying a 360, you really need to consider the higher end.
1694558	1698222	And I'm not saying that as somebody who works for Microsoft, because I don't, but...
1699400	1700320	Just do the math.
1700541	1710325	If you think that later on you might be interested in any of this stuff, such as the hard drive, you're going to end up paying more in the long run if you buy just the core system and then all this stuff separately.
1710625	1711865	So you really need to think about this.
1712085	1712966	Hey, folks, listen.
1713866	1716227	The hard drive, just a laptop drive anyways.
1717268	1718068	Think about it, folks.
1718128	1719108	Buy the hard drive.
1719649	1720329	Upgrade it for free.
1720999	1725992	or get the converter, you know I'm going to be hooking up some 300 gig hard drive to that thing.
1726433	1727716	You know that's going to happen.
1727796	1729521	It's a matter of time.
1730629	1732991	The only thing, they didn't actually show it as part of the show.
1759553	1765895	and Dance Dance Revolution was there to comment and their comment was Suck it, Halo 2!
1765955	1766076	Wow.
1773621	1776662	Blizzard won a pretty important hacking lawsuit this week.
1776702	1777802	I think this is kind of interesting.
1777822	1780362	There was an appeals court, the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals in St.
1780402	1795105	Louis, and they ruled this week that federal law, specifically the DMCA, or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, disallows players from altering Blizzard games to link with servers other than the company's official Battle.net site.
1795505	1798586	So there were defendants in this case, Ross Combs, Rob Favreau,
1798826	1799467	Critterden.
1799587	1812258	They reverse engineered Blizzard's protocol using some tools such as TCP dump and they had this project going on, the BnetD, that would allow your Blizzard games to connect with unofficial servers.
1812839	1817263	And of course you get faster response times and all sorts of things that come along with using unofficial servers.
1817603	1823148	However, Blizzard layeth the smack down for them reverse engineering the program, so to speak.
1823269	1823489	So
1824483	1829667	What I find is interesting is I know a lot of people that have sort of done something similar with Xbox Live.
1829808	1840857	Now, I'm not too familiar on the exacts of how they hack, so it's probably a different process, but I think it's interesting that this kind of sets a precedent in a way.
1841457	1843219	Well, this is just dumb.
1843439	1849364	I think this is about StarCraft, if I remember correctly, and it was just servers that they're playing on.
1849384	1852146	I mean, it's not like that you actually have to pay for it.
1852206	1852727	It's free.
1853490	1854631	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
1872378	1874979	Quarter of a million units sold already.
1875319	1875799	In the first week.
1876200	1877020	In the first week.
1877120	1885403	That's about 15% of the amount of people that own a DS, which for, you know, a game in the first week of release is pretty damn good.
1886404	1890965	A game that came out the same day, Advance Wars Dual Strike, also selling pretty well.
1891346	1895247	So don't assume that Nintendogs is the only must-own DS game right now.
1895587	1897208	Advance Wars, doing pretty well.
1897228	1899889	I haven't had a chance to check out that game myself, but I've heard good things about it, so...
1900965	1902446	Battalion Wars coming out soon too.
1902886	1904487	That's Advanced Wars for the GameCube.
1922097	1925559	They will be doing a PlayStation Spot.
1925919	1930901	It's like a booth where the PSP owners will be able to download demos of upcoming games from this spot.
1931301	1933262	Hmm, where have I heard this before?
1933482	1936784	Oh yes, Nintendo's DS download booth at E3.
1937264	1938104	And how did that work?
1938224	1939345	Oh yeah, that's right, not very well.
1939838	1940699	BaitoHell2000 and PortableResort
1963359	1964640	I haven't heard of those last two.
1964700	1969504	Portable Resorts, Namco, and this weird Rengoku 2.
1969584	1972707	I'm surprised they're even making a sequel to that.
1973647	1974868	The first one kind of sucked.
1975349	1976290	Well, check it out.
1976410	1977350	It's going to be downloadable.
1977490	1979432	And then Rockman Legends.
1979492	1980493	It's pretty cool, actually.
1982426	1983448	I played a little bit of it.
1983608	1984189	Yeah, how was that?
1984669	1986973	This is the direct port of the PlayStation game.
1987013	1987634	That's all it is.
1987734	1988836	It's just direct port.
1989096	1989637	Looks cool.
1990578	1991319	I'm excited about it.
1991339	1993663	I wish they'd release more sequels, but you know.
1994404	1996427	Loki got a couple of hack and crack stories for us tonight.
1997286	1998867	Yes, yes, I do.
1999487	2010472	The first on the list is the We Are Back group, the ones behind several of the launchers and the whole exploit to actually play Homebrew stuff.
2011092	2015374	They've released a program to actually fake update your system.
2015814	2021297	So in other words, for example, on my system, which was a 1.5, because I have two, but...
2022057	2028662	I upgraded mine to a fake 152, which will allow me to play Namco Museum Collection, which wants to upgrade your system if you don't.
2028742	2030643	And it won't play unless you upgrade your system.
2031184	2033705	But, because it tricks it, now you can play it.
2034126	2038949	And you can do this through, you know, just version 1 all the way to 2.
2041135	2046218	What's also interesting is actually they're working on it right now because they want to be perfect on it.
2046659	2052863	They have a way to revert those systems that actually are 1.5.2 and 1.5.1 to revert them back to 1.5.
2053443	2054584	So they play homebrew stuff.
2054624	2062870	So if you haven't upgraded yours to 2.0 yet and you're not 1.5, why don't they just work on getting the homebrew stuff to work with 2.0?
2062910	2064691	Because I kind of want 2.0 features.
2064731	2065431	They have 2.0.
2066852	2069154	They changed all their encryption the way they do it.
2069767	2074350	So it's a little tougher, but pretty soon it's not going to matter.
2074470	2078272	So they can revert those 1.5, 2.1s back to 1.5.
2079692	2081674	Next step is 2.0s to 1.5.
2082434	2083294	It's a matter of time.
2084335	2085616	We'll see.
2086256	2087917	But that's what they've got going on right now.
2088517	2092219	Other than that, just the same homebrew stuff, made a Minesweeper game.
2092239	2096502	It's kind of cool, but yeah, that's pretty much all that's going on.
2096802	2097042	All right.
2098369	2100050	Uh, let's get to some housekeeping stuff.
2100090	2101610	Let's start it off with a mailbag, shall we?
2103351	2105952	Of course, if you want to send us an email, you can always drop us a line.
2105992	2111634	It's togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com to send us an email.
2112034	2113634	We got just two emails this week.
2113974	2118536	I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on emails tonight, because we've spent enough time talking about stuff.
2118656	2121357	But, we did get a couple good emails, and we want to read this.
2121557	2125418	Certainly, this one is a difference of opinion type issue.
2125938	2126979	This one comes to us from Ed M.,
2128318	2129239	Send us this email here.
2129839	2133862	It says, I really enjoy the shows and congrats on the pod show awards.
2135122	2137964	Actually, I don't think, did we win something for pod show?
2138004	2138805	I don't think that was that.
2138825	2139625	I think it's podcast.
2139645	2140906	Yeah, it's the podcast award.
2141186	2143087	If we did win something for pod show, that's news to me.
2143147	2143567	Hey, cool.
2143888	2146229	No, I think pod show is Adam Curry's side.
2146969	2148470	I get lost in all that podcasting.
2148610	2150852	You know, I'm just here to talk about games.
2151701	2153262	If we win a couple awards for it, cool.
2153362	2154103	But no, that's alright.
2154483	2156104	We know it gets confusing.
2156124	2157685	Here's the real part of the letter we want to read.
2158326	2161148	You guys really need to lay off parents and how they raise their children.
2161328	2166592	I am a parent with two adolescent boys who is also a gamer and have been since I was in junior high.
2166952	2169834	You guys, on the other hand, are not parents and really have no clue about it.
2170034	2171795	Yet you profess to have it all worked out.
2172276	2175278	Allow me to be the first to tell you that you forget about it.
2175438	2176799	Everything you think will change.
2176879	2178560	I think there was a little grammar there, but that's alright.
2178580	2179421	You get what she's saying there.
2179441	2180262	Um...
2181142	2188470	Even if I have read and signed your proposed disclaimer, it still would not have protected my children from the Easter egg in San Andreas had I purchased that for my sons.
2188950	2196318	In your infinite wisdom, you have not addressed how to protect the consumers from the game developers that you continue to defend that lie their asses off.
2196758	2200381	Rockstar lied about the hows and whys of that particular programming gem.
2200742	2207067	The game developers have every right to put into their games whatever they want, but if I ask, I also have the right to be told the truth.
2207488	2209189	They share in the responsibility.
2209510	2211311	Let me finish this mail, then we'll respond here.
2211712	2214114	Games, reviews, news, and like is your shtick.
2214454	2216916	Trying to explain to people how to be parents is not.
2217377	2219879	Stick to what you know and leave parenting to the parents in the audience.
2220680	2221060	Burn.
2221587	2221908	DarkSakura
2230174	2230614	Let me start.
2231214	2236116	So he does say that Rockstar lied about the hows and why of the particular programming gem.
2236156	2239337	Of course, the hot coffee mod going back a couple months ago to that news there.
2240177	2245419	I do think that there was, and I said this a couple months ago when this story first came out.
2245939	2251882	I do think when Rockstar put this game out, they never intended that mod to be seen.
2252122	2258724	I do think they put it in the game on purpose, but somewhere in the testing process, they intended to take it out.
2259913	2265898	As I've mentioned on a previous show, I think a pointer, of course, if you design a game, you have a flowchart, right?
2266139	2268901	Basically a ginormous flowchart that works your way through the game.
2269381	2276067	Whatever led from the game to the hot coffee part, that pointer was taken out.
2276508	2279410	So in Rockstar's eyes, there was no possible way.
2279430	2283554	There was no up, up, down, down, left, right code that was going to let you access that.
2284094	2285115	It was out of the game.
2285535	2290517	A very similar parallel would be Dance Dance Revolution Extreme.
2290577	2299481	No, there's no hot coffee mod in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, but there is a song, Memories is the song, Konami took this song out of the game at the last minute.
2299821	2300182	Why?
2300642	2301182	I don't know.
2301522	2305084	But instead of taking the song out, all the data's on the disc.
2305664	2313447	but some hackers found out that if you turn a certain hexamodestal point on or whatever, hack your card data, you can access the song.
2313467	2316308	It's like you're putting the pointer back in on the flowchart.
2316668	2318829	That's what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.
2318889	2324431	I'm almost positive this is what happened is that that pointer that was intended to get taken out got put back in.
2325072	2333795	And of course with a huge company like Rockstar you probably have the programmers that knew that was in there but they had thought they had taken it out and didn't realize that some kid was going to
2334642	2340880	figure out how to put it back in so whose fault is this in this case I don't know but here's what I do know
2341840	2367780	programmers will be taking the extra effort from now on instead of simply taking a pointer out they're going to go back and recompile all the data and these games will be pushed back a couple of months while they rebuild the code from the ground up to ensure that this crap is no longer in the games when it's not intended to be because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has set the bar at that now that you can no longer leave this stuff that you do not want accessed on the disc because people will find it and they will play it
2368461	2369743	and as you can see what happened here.
2370243	2382843	Now, in regards to the portion of the email that talks about the person being a parent with kids and also being a gamer, I'm going to guess if you're a gamer, you know what is and isn't appropriate for your kids.
2383675	2407135	so when we go off on parents or what have you please don't assume you sir are part of these people unfortunately there are many many out there educated parents and you're right I may not be a parent myself but I see it I see these parents that are going into the stores and they're letting their kids boss them around and the kids are the ones picking up the game and
2408135	2412777	They don't seem to be... The parents that are buying the game are absolutely clueless.
2412817	2413638	This is stuff that's in there.
2413938	2419721	I have watched a kid pick up Grand Theft Auto San Andreas and the parent just goes, is that something you should be playing?
2419761	2421462	And the kid goes, yeah, it's fine.
2421482	2423282	And the parent goes, okay, son.
2423463	2424163	And it's just kind of like...
2425750	2430392	I don't have to be a parent to recognize there's something not right there.
2430432	2439715	If it was a movie, if the movie was rated R, the parent wanted to know why it's rated R. And certainly I envision that one day I may have children and I have ideas on how to raise them.
2440195	2446037	So do I necessarily have kids myself and have these first person experiences?
2446477	2446697	No.
2446777	2448198	And am I going to be the perfect parent?
2448358	2448558	No.
2448638	2451899	Because some other freaking, probably if I do have kids...
2452598	2456781	A friend could always expose my kid to the games I don't want him to see.
2457162	2458723	And that's just something we've got to deal with.
2459723	2471072	And I say that we talk to our kids about what is and isn't appropriate in games because just like you would talk to them about sex and R-rated things, talk to them about it, drugs, all that stuff.
2471812	2475195	And that's the best way is to be a part of your kid's life.
2475295	2479058	And I don't think I have to be a parent to necessarily know that, I hope.
2479665	2480726	I don't know, that's just my fuse.
2480886	2481126	Loki?
2503462	2504263	Thank you for watching!
2519153	2519653	You know what?
2519733	2520574	You made the decision.
2520594	2523076	It may have been a bad decision, but you've got to live with it.
2523176	2524957	That's basically what it is.
2525537	2535464	Really, the people we're talking to are like dumb grandma who doesn't know anything, and she is suing Rockstar because little Billy saw some polygon boob.
2535684	2536465	Well, you know what?
2536925	2544510	Little Billy shouldn't have been playing the game, and grandma should have listened to the stupid little thing that's on every single game, the ratings that are on there.
2544570	2545751	That's why they put them on there.
2545771	2547492	They don't put it on there just for the hell of it.
2547972	2548993	So, you know what?
2549714	2554581	Those are the people that want to put the responsibility on the game publishers.
2554621	2560168	The ones that are saying, oh well, I didn't know that this game says over 18.
2560289	2562632	I thought that my son was okay because he's 13.
2565546	2567847	No, okay, so, yeah, that's what I'm saying.
2568107	2572570	Anyway, you know, we certainly are okay with the disagreement and opinion.
2572610	2573190	That's cool.
2573891	2579815	And we encourage, you know, if you guys have another email, send it on over to go at orangeonstrider.com, anybody that wants to say something.
2580215	2587039	Or, of course, you know, because we can only read so many emails a show, we do have the forums as well, and I'm going to be talking about that in a minute during some housekeeping.
2587059	2588360	But let's get to our second email tonight.
2588800	2591542	This is from rlove is the name of the person that sent this.
2591582	2592943	I like that name, rlove.
2593385	2606892	Our love wanted to ask, I just wanted to ask if you've heard anything about whether or not the current Logitech wireless controllers will be able to be used on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2607453	2610314	By the way, Josh Sweden is writing and directing Wonder Woman.
2610634	2617018	I'm not sure what I would be more worried about, how bad the movie will be or how crappy the obviously forthcoming game based on it will be.
2617678	2620640	It just proves once again Hollywood's total lack of creativity.
2620760	2623602	On the plus side, there has to be a Linda Carter cameo in it.
2623902	2625183	Anything else is sacrilege.
2625243	2627825	That, of course, related to the Wonder Woman story I mentioned last week.
2627945	2628525	Or was it two weeks ago?
2628545	2629006	I don't remember.
2629046	2635370	By the way, I read Uwe Boll had an interview on 1UP.com this week, and he thinks his movies are good.
2636600	2640341	Whoa, there's someone that has no grasp of reality right there.
2642061	2646322	Yes, I did hear about Joss Whedon doing the Wonder Woman movie or Buffy the Lasso Slayer.
2646422	2646943	No, I don't know.
2647663	2648943	No, I liked Buffy the show.
2648983	2650524	I'm not hardcore about, like, my roommate.
2650644	2653484	Just so you guys know, my roommate is hardcore Buffy Angel fan.
2653544	2655005	He's hard fucking core.
2655045	2656105	He has all the DVDs.
2656165	2659426	For the record, he has the Buffy soundtrack right here on his computer desk.
2661386	2664808	Don't tell Extra for this, but he listens to the music in his car and everything.
2665168	2666169	I even know the songs.
2666249	2667470	Not that there's anything wrong with that.
2667490	2669411	I like Buffy, but he's hardcore.
2670111	2671592	I'm sure the movie's going to be cool.
2671652	2673053	I think Serenity looks pretty cool.
2673073	2674433	That's a Joss Whedon thing, too.
2674453	2675634	Serenity looks pretty badass.
2675994	2676735	So we'll see.
2677875	2678356	Who knows?
2678496	2681417	Can't really say until we start seeing some actual footage from the movie.
2681938	2683879	But Joss Whedon does have that little sense of humor.
2683919	2686740	That's the one thing I did like about Buffy is it was very tongue-in-cheek.
2687140	2690062	So if the Wonder Woman movie, it could benefit from that.
2690482	2695524	Here's the other part of the letter, of course, the Logitech wireless controllers being able to be used on PS3 and Xbox 360.
2695824	2701806	I would guess no, because PS3's really changed their controller from the ground up.
2701866	2704307	It looks, I mean, the boomerang style controller now.
2705027	2708768	I just think, and especially now, aren't they going Bluetooth as well?
2709748	2710529	I don't even know.
2710609	2711449	I have a feeling they are.
2712169	2712950	Don't count on it.
2712990	2715372	We don't know for sure, our love, but don't count on it.
2732912	2735214	with massive lag, because that's what's going to happen.
2735274	2735754	You know what?
2736015	2740558	Sadly, I think you're just going to have to upgrade your controller to one of the new wireless controllers.
2740638	2741799	But don't quote me on it.
2741919	2742720	I'm not on the inside.
2742760	2750887	I don't know for sure, but I would just think because of the drastic change that both controllers are going through physically, I just don't see it happening.
2750907	2753429	Yeah, that does suck, because I liked using my DualShock...
2755424	2759167	PS1 controllers with my PlayStation 2 because I was a cheap bastard.
2759688	2762870	I know the Xbox 360 one can't work because they added an extra button.
2762890	2764211	They added the media center button.
2764492	2765873	So I just, I don't see it working.
2767454	2768675	The Xbox 360 button is useless.
2770317	2770577	It is.
2771077	2771598	But it's there.
2772078	2772959	The ring of light.
2773659	2774300	It's just a button.
2774600	2782787	Alright, again, if you want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangelaundrydo.com Square Enix and Namco announced their lineup for the Tokyo Game Show.
2782867	2783868	Namco is going to be showing...
2784229	2798198	Tales of the Abyss, Soul Calibur III, Critical Velocity, MotoGP4, and Urban Reign for the PS2, Ridge Racer 6, and Frame City Killer for the Xbox 360, and some other games, including Tales of Eternia Online for the PC.
2798718	2807784	Squeenix will be showing Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebrus, Kingdom Hearts II, Code Age Commanders for the PS2, and on PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox 360.
2809085	2814635	Final Fantasy XI as to what capacity they'll be showing Final Fantasy XI on 360, don't know yet.
2814795	2818441	And for all those waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2 to be coming out in October, guess what?
2818461	2819163	It's coming out next year.
2820329	2820669	Really?
2820729	2821489	When did you find that out?
2821769	2824030	I found that out from the Square Enix guy.
2824590	2825550	I haven't heard that announced.
2825691	2827331	It's not coming out until next year.
2827711	2828911	It got pushed out of this year.
2829251	2830132	You were here first.
2830352	2832972	The big one coming out this year from Square Enix, Dragon Quest VIII.
2833213	2834533	That's going to be the big one.
2834573	2836533	But Kingdom Hearts, it went bye-bye.
2837094	2838794	Oh, I did not know that.
2838874	2840034	That's news to me.
2840114	2840775	Yep, next year.
2840915	2841755	Interesting.
2841875	2842195	Okay.
2842779	2849181	What I also thought was interesting is Square Enix is going to be showing EverQuest 2 because I guess they have the distribution rights overseas to that one, which I think is interesting.
2850522	2851402	Notice what's missing.
2851542	2854723	Front Mission 5 and, hello, Final Fantasy 12.
2855864	2858605	Missing from the showing list at Tokyo Game Show.
2858725	2865627	Missing... That's a... I hope the... Man, don't you start to worry that the game's just going to get called off.
2866128	2866908	I'd be so mad.
2867288	2869769	Because the E3 demo a year and a half ago was so pretty.
2870182	2872684	You know, I'm saying at this point it's probably going to be next gen.
2873084	2873685	It's got to be.
2873865	2875166	I mean, think about it.
2875186	2877147	I'm probably like, eh, fine.
2877247	2877888	I don't know about that.
2878348	2878908	I don't know about that.
2880290	2884092	Extreme Ghouls and Ghosts coming out for the PSP.
2884553	2886894	That is confirmed by Famitsu Magazine.
2887595	2892178	Of course, this being based on the Ghouls and Ghosts series, which dates back to the 80s.
2893019	2895421	It was reinvented on the PS2, etc., etc., etc.
2897386	2902650	The PSP version will have branching paths as determined by certain warp points.
2903331	2906734	Each path having its own treasure so you can replay certain levels.
2906794	2909756	So, you know, just trying to add something a little new to the game, I guess.
2910297	2913680	Ghouls N' Ghosts, good game, although it's been redone about a gazillion times.
2913740	2917143	But I'm still very loyal to the old Super Nintendo, Super Ghouls N' Ghosts.
2917883	2921046	So we'll see how the PSP one turns out a little later when this game comes out.
2922367	2923188	I guess next year.
2923228	2925810	I don't really see a date for this one, so we'll see.
2927895	2932137	I want to get into some housekeeping tonight, some various housekeeping news on tonight's podcast.
2932997	2936239	First off, we've made some changes to the website, just little, little changes.
2936619	2938700	Our forums, we've actually restructured them.
2938740	2942302	So we have a forum strictly for podcast talk now.
2942342	2945283	So if you have some feedback, you want to talk about something we've talked about on the podcast,
2945666	2948767	One of our stories, perhaps further discussion on Hot Coffee Mod.
2949068	2952069	We encourage you to go to our forums, www.orangeonsradio.com.
2952089	2954510	We have a brand new Orange Ons Radio podcast forum.
2954530	2957572	We're just trying to breathe some life into our forums because freaking nobody posts there.
2957652	2963735	So we might have to do a giveaway or something to a random post to try and get incentive because we like it when people post there.
2964335	2968397	It gives me something to read at work when I should be working as I'm sure a lot of you feel about it.
2969606	2975251	Also, we're going to be adding to our page a links section that will be specific for each podcast.
2975291	2982379	So some popular links that we talk about because a lot of folks have been complaining, well, you read these links and they're huge and we have no way to find these sites.
2982399	2986343	So we're going to add a links section that we can index the links by podcast.
2986363	2990147	And I actually want to give you a couple links that have to do with some show things.
2990827	2992307	First one is one of our listeners.
2992387	3000069	One of our listeners, a guy that goes by DJ Ranma S, who lives out on the East Coast, he actually has a really creative idea for Hurricane Katrina relief.
3000109	3011471	And of course, Hurricane Katrina was a huge impact this past week, and we know we had some very close listeners, some longtime fans of Orange Launch Radio dating back to, you know, 2000... When did we start this thing?
3012091	3011471	2002?
3012891	3017312	Back to 2002 when we first started with the live station, we're affected and lost everything, and we just...
3018684	3024489	It's so horrible to hear about, and I don't want to get too grim details, because you're here to hear about video games.
3024850	3027632	But I think what DJ Ranma S is doing is really cool.
3028813	3032916	As you guys know, I'm sure you've seen on many of the popular websites, you can donate to the Red Cross.
3033277	3037060	But maybe you're thinking, gosh, I don't really have money to give to the Red Cross.
3037460	3040543	Well, DJ Ranma S is actually really big in the cosplay community.
3040983	3043125	So he thought, well, what do we do in the cosplay community?
3043165	3044026	We're constantly...
3045675	3046395	Thank you for watching!
3064783	3068727	They're doing this a lot on the East Coast, but they're trying to organize collection spots throughout the country.
3069067	3069508	Check it out.
3069548	3075334	It's DJRanmaS.net slash HTML slash project underscore relief dot HTML.
3075374	3076555	We will, of course, put a link.
3076916	3077116	I know.
3077136	3078057	See, that's such a huge link.
3078297	3081180	We're going to put a link on OrangeLaundry.com so you guys can check that out.
3082121	3085405	So thank you, Ranma S, for putting that together, and we'll see what we can do.
3085805	3087086	Put together as a donation for that.
3087326	3088146	I think that's a great idea.
3089047	3105715	Also, this is one of those things I should have mentioned last week on the show, but there's an independent record label that actually started up in the Sacramento area, and they do kind of goth, industrial-style music, which if you're into Ultramix 2 or DDR Ultramix 3 lately, seems to be having quite a bit of that.
3106195	3113279	And actually, the administrator of the DDR Freaks forums, Iguana Girl, is actually throwing her...
3114344	3115265	Dark Records in Clothing
3136852	3137912	So good luck to those guys.
3138213	3139853	Support independent music, guys.
3139873	3144074	Funny enough, I was just talking to my friend earlier today who lives up around this area.
3144674	3150916	And he had mentioned a co-worker being a DJ and saying, yeah, his name's DJ Illogical Beats.
3151096	3154417	And he has this thing coming out with Blood and Synth.
3154457	3157978	I'm like, I read that on a friend's live journal on Iguana Girls, actually, no less.
3158318	3161298	And I was like, wow, man, this world just gets smaller and smaller.
3161358	3161879	Amazing.
3161999	3163199	Yeah, he's a co-worker of his.
3163519	3165421	Wow, that's very cool.
3166241	3167162	Kevin Bacon, man.
3168263	3169544	All right, check that out, you guys.
3170024	3173948	We definitely want to support the independent record labels, especially the ones that have been supporting us.
3174788	3175449	So check that out.
3176428	3177549	Metal Slug 6 is coming out on SNK Playmore
3195569	3210300	It's the seventh installment in the Metal Slug series because of Metal Slug X, and it's being developed for Sammy's Atomos Wave platform, which would of course be a little bit different than the Neo Geo arcade system you're used to.
3210360	3212362	So this is a new arcade game that's coming out.
3213963	3218126	Metal Slug 6, I know there's a lot of Metal Slug fans out there, so I just thought I'd
3218544	3219144	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3235288	3237270	Mario Kart Arcade Game
3252884	3260706	Sweet Coden 5 is on its way and a playable demo of the game will be available at Tokyo Game Show September 16th through 18th.
3261206	3268988	Sweet Coden 5 taking place in the Queendom of Felina, a kingdom which was referred to a few times in the previous games.
3269849	3274350	Don't know quite about the time frame of Sweet Coden 5, but I hear it's going to be pretty good.
3274590	3279171	I hear if you were disappointed by Sweet Coden 4, Sweet Coden 5 will make things better.
3279771	3281252	That, of course, coming out for the PlayStation 2.
3281532	3282513	It will not be a next-gen game.
3282533	3283293	It's going to be PlayStation 2.
3283333	3286315	You also have to figure that Suikoden Tactics is going to be in there somewhere, too.
3286335	3286655	That's right.
3286695	3288336	So Suikoden, big thing for Konami right now.
3288816	3292038	Unlock all those million characters that are in the game.
3293339	3297181	Advent Children, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children, going to be getting its own title song.
3297441	3299942	Of course, title songs being a big thing in Square games.
3299982	3303464	You know, Simple and Clean, Eyes on Me, you know.
3304205	3307506	Advent Children, even though it's not a game, it's a movie, has its own song.
3307967	3308047	Um...
3308800	3335386	Kyusuki Himiro with Calling but the weird thing is it's actually from his 1989 album Neo Fasico but that's the theme song and supposedly says the Advent Children director Tetsuya Nomura for the setting of Advent Children it's very fitting so an old 80s classic make its way I got another email the other day saying it's going to be November 30th or 29th so November 29th
3338902	3343746	Like I said before, son of a bitch, they pushed it back.
3343766	3346348	The soundtrack is supposedly being released September 28th.
3346508	3348090	Good for them.
3348250	3349391	In Japan.
3350752	3355856	All I'm hoping is to see a copy when it's leaked to the internet, which will be the day after.
3358271	3381770	For those of you guys that were kind of ticked off at Xbox 360's dual level pricing thing going on, PlayStation 3 would just like you to know, well at least on British website gamesindustry.biz, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Vice President Phil Harrison said, doing that multiple pricing level for PlayStation 3, unlikely.
3382310	3383791	So you don't have to worry about this.
3383871	3386273	You'll just be shelling out $500 for the PlayStation 3 to start.
3386313	3386713	No, I'm kidding.
3386773	3387113	I'm kidding.
3387533	3387874	I don't know.
3387954	3388274	I don't know.
3388874	3390655	Well, let me just put it this way.
3390675	3392476	It's not going to be cheap.
3393577	3397900	Also says Phil Harrison, are there two versions of the Xbox 360 that people want to buy?
3398160	3398700	I don't know.
3399040	3400001	I look at those formats.
3400221	3402182	I think it just confuses the audience.
3402523	3403663	They don't know which one to buy.
3403823	3405524	Developers don't know which one to create for.
3405865	3407986	And retailers don't know which one to stock.
3408506	3410548	So I think we wouldn't take that strategy.
3410788	3411809	We wouldn't want to create confusion.
3411829	3415433	They made some huge mistakes doing the double skews on those.
3415553	3418876	First one being is now there's no guarantee that there's going to be a hard drive in there.
3419176	3421779	Developers can't develop their games with hard drive support.
3422639	3428305	The other thing that they made a mistake on is that there's only a DVD drive in there, not like any next-gen format.
3429826	3432969	They're running out of space on the DVDs to put the games in.
3433755	3438156	They're going to run into a lot of hurdles with this thing, and it's not looking good.
3438696	3439576	We'll see, we'll see.
3441117	3443997	King of Fighters just came out this week for the Xbox.
3444017	3447638	Just kind of wanted to tip our hat at that one.
3447838	3449918	2002 and 2003 editions coming out for the Xbox.
3450279	3454499	By the way, it was actually already released for the PlayStation 2, but this has Xbox Live support.
3456440	3459621	For those of you guys that are into King of Farters... Did I say King of Farters?
3459741	3461161	It's always King of Farters!
3462635	3464736	Yeah, we're definitely running late here on the show.
3466316	3476918	Sony, possibly, also, by the way, something that was said by Phil Harrison, boy, this guy's got a big mouth lately, but that's good, we like guys with big mouths, because it gives us a hint to what these companies are thinking.
3477459	3479959	Possibly charging for PSP downloads in 2006.
3480259	3483420	Hmm.
3483680	3490782	Saying that possibly Wipeout Pier was kind of like a test case for something that could be coming in the future.
3490842	3491182	He says...
3491764	3493585	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
3512219	3512539	I don't know.
3512659	3515301	I know what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to work.
3515341	3515581	All right.
3538840	3540640	Last story tonight, the last story.
3541161	3544961	Bungie, the folks behind Halo, getting into the Hurricane Katrina relief.
3544981	3545662	This is pretty cool.
3546042	3554504	They've created a custom t-shirt, and the custom t-shirt shows a little Master Chief, and he looks like he's kind of kicking some hurricane butt there, like literally.
3554524	3558645	I don't know what that's... It actually looks like a giant cotton ball with teeth, but I think it's supposed to be a hurricane.
3559265	3561145	Kicking it, saying, fight the flood.
3561485	3564846	And they're selling this little custom shirt, trying to get gamers to show support.
3565166	3567147	They're saying that roughly $15 of each shirt sold...
3568567	3571269	We'll go directly to the hurricane relief effort.
3571329	3576373	So if you're interested in checking that out, head on over to Bungie.net and check that out.
3576393	3578774	We'll also, of course, provide a link to that on our new links page.
3579435	3580996	So that's that.
3583718	3591443	The other thing about speaking a little bit about Xbox here, Origin Xbox 360, another viral site.
3591764	3595486	The countdown is going to be done on Monday the 26th of this month.
3595566	3596467	So we'll know what that is.
3597423	3597723	DarkSakura.com
3619816	3625737	All I know is I was smart this time and did not pre-book my system at the mall.
3626017	3630118	I did a really small game stop that's nearby my house so I can go pick it up and leave.
3631278	3631759	Sounds good.
3632539	3634459	Alright, wow, we broke an hour tonight, kids.
3634539	3636300	Our first podcast over an hour in length.
3636360	3637780	It's definitely time to wrap it up.
3637920	3638800	We just have a lot to say.
3639200	3641181	And plus, you know, we've been doing a little drinking, so we're rambling.
3641261	3642161	Drink responsibly, kids.
3642201	3642681	Don't drink and drive.
3643291	3644212	I won't.
3644432	3646293	Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts.
3646413	3648094	Mel B, thank you for being here tonight.
3648134	3651376	Appreciate you kind of filling in for DarkSakura the last half of the show.
3651537	3652797	Well, thanks for having me.
3652897	3656660	I mean, I guess being the first guest on the podcast, you know, this means something.
3656720	3660362	I mean, see, wasn't I there for like the first Orange Lounge promo as well?
3661123	3662064	One of our first promo.
3662084	3666727	You were there like probably within the first two months of our live program way back in 2002.
3667627	3669989	So, you know, as we say in the hood, I ain't new to it.
3670009	3670629	I'm true to it.
3671010	3673111	Well, we appreciate you being loyal to us.
3673493	3677335	Thank you very much, and thank you for your tips earlier on tonight on the game industry.
3677615	3679376	Oh yeah, definitely, no problem, man.
3679596	3687300	Hopefully I'll be back for another show, be a podcaster live, and of course I'll probably be bringing in a couple more new CDs along the way.
3687320	3688881	You didn't touch on that on the podcast.
3688941	3694564	Not on the podcast, but we did talk about it on another program that we do for Orange Launch Radio.
3695465	3702630	The new CDs by Zonk and Orifiz, which are going to be actually part of Ultramix 3.
3702891	3707094	Actually, I'm not sure about Zonk's involvement in Ultramix 3, but Orifiz being one of them.
3707214	3708295	Yeah, Orifiz, definitely.
3708455	3711417	Basile, the song, will be in Ultramix 3.
3711738	3716762	I talked to Dave, who is the guy behind Orifiz and actually is also one of the musicians on Zonk.
3717342	3721865	and he said that they're looking into a possible download for a future song.
3722505	3723886	I mean, yeah, I've gotten to hear them.
3723946	3727748	I actually got to see them in concert a couple times, you know, just in the past couple months.
3727768	3732331	They're actually going to be taking a break from touring because the lead singer is actually having a baby.
3733072	3733612	Oh, nice.
3733972	3734252	Yeah.
3734332	3734873	Very cool.
3735373	3740896	Well, I like supporting the independent music, so check this out, www.zonkaholics.com.
3740976	3744359	So think zonk like let's make a deal, zonkaholics.com.
3744699	3745579	Check out more info on that.
3745879	3746500	Thanks for being here, Moe.
3747111	3748051	Loki, your final thought.
3748551	3754152	Thanks to all the publishers that I gave those wonderful press kits out to that are listening to the show.
3755012	3760873	All, like, a few of you, but Namco, dude, if you're listening, sorry I ripped on your game tonight, but it really did suck.
3760893	3762554	I don't think you gave one to Namco, actually.
3762654	3763174	Oh, okay, well then.
3763194	3766754	I don't remember, because I like other, Katamari Damacy, love it.
3766834	3768255	Konami's got one.
3768395	3770715	I gave one to the Tomo guy, which is awesome.
3770815	3771475	They were great.
3771895	3776516	We're actually supposed to go, now this is funny, we're supposed to be going with Daniel and Eric
3776912	3785618	from Tomo, or no, not Daniel, Tomo, or the guy from Koei and the guy from Agetech or Tomo, the guy, basic company that distributes them.
3785798	3786278	Ah, stop, Nate.
3786298	3787619	Anyways, anyways, okay.
3787839	3792202	We're supposed to go in whitewater rafting in the spring, which is interesting.
3792342	3792822	Huh.
3792962	3794443	How's that for company relationships?
3794483	3796725	But, no, it was really fun.
3796965	3798546	I enjoyed, you know, talking with them.
3798646	3801928	I talked their ears off about their product, and I'm glad that, you know,
3802557	3804639	I had someone talk to who actually understood what I was talking to.
3804659	3806621	Well, hopefully, you know, they understood, you know.
3806721	3808702	But it was just, you know, it was fun.
3809463	3814808	And really, I got to learn a lot of stuff and make those connections that we really needed to make.
3815248	3821213	And hopefully, Daniel at Konami is going to be sending me those VRares for...
3822139	3823401	Extreme 2, and Ultramix 3.
3823961	3828046	And hopefully some of these companies will listen to your pleas for prizes that we're going to turn around and give to our listeners.
3828086	3830389	Yeah, you know, we plug a lot of the games out here.
3830689	3837097	We talk about everything that comes out and everything, and it's really cool, and I love playing everything out there.
3837157	3838939	I play whatever I get my hands on, so...
3840944	3842626	My final thought is we've got to wrap this stuff up.
3842846	3846629	We're over an hour tonight, but I truly want to thank you guys for listening to us and supporting us.
3846689	3850031	Our shows just continue to grow in the six months we've been doing it.
3850792	3852613	Actually, no, God, it's been like nine months now.
3853594	3854575	Thank you guys so much.
3855055	3856216	Tell a friend about the show.
3856937	3860179	You can always throw us a vote on Podcast Alley or one of the other podcast sites.
3860199	3861861	Just help us spread the word.
3861941	3864503	That's the best way that we can continue to grow.
3864523	3865584	More big things will be coming.
3865844	3867725	Maybe we'll break the two-hour mark soon enough.
3867785	3868186	No, we've got to...
3868866	3871068	We're going to keep these shows under an hour usually.
3871628	3875251	But thank you guys for listening and we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
3875291	3875771	Happy gaming!
3877613	3881175	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition.
3881476	3888461	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update!
