only tech master Loki I'm here how you doing I'm good good all right usually

00:57.600 --> 01:01.160
We like to start off the show with a little bit of how was your gaming week? What do you been playing?

01:01.160 --> 01:04.820
Let's get right into it dark soccer. What do you been playing this week puppies?

01:06.320 --> 01:09.800
Everybody puppies have you been good about it you actually going in there every day

01:09.840 --> 01:14.560
Yeah, and I walk my puppies and clean up their poopy and I make them eat catch frisbee and earn me money

01:14.680 --> 01:17.040
So I pimp out my puppies to the frisbee people

01:17.040 --> 01:21.440
Do you think the game is starting to get to the point of it's getting a little irritating having to go in every day?

01:21.440 --> 01:25.560
No, no, cuz that's what some people are bitching about. I'm hearing well

01:25.560 --> 01:30.440
And they you know never had a virtual pet before and ten dogs was not for them

01:30.600 --> 01:33.440
They never carried around their pocket Pikachu damn it I

01:34.840 --> 01:38.940
Also, but I went to Dave and Busters last night and played battle tech for the first time mm-hmm

01:39.660 --> 01:45.080
Yeah, they gave me a headache made me want to throw up now describe battle tech for those who may not know you get in

01:45.080 --> 01:49.000
these pod things and basically it's like you're in the cockpit of a mech and

01:49.520 --> 01:51.520
You go around killing people

01:51.520 --> 01:56.860
I didn't like it maybe because they it's one of those games where the screens up

01:56.860 --> 02:02.260
on top and it reflects onto a concave mirror oh it's weird and it just oh it

02:02.260 --> 02:10.700
totally messes my sense of motion sickness I played one in the midnight

02:10.700 --> 02:15.540
maximum tune last night and completely owned my husband so weird saying that

02:15.540 --> 02:20.940
your husband ten days and I still have trouble writing my last name I haven't

02:20.940 --> 02:31.660
into the DMV yet either. I also played a bunch of ticket games and that was really...

02:31.660 --> 02:34.640
State Busters is the one place where playing ticket games can be cool, not like Chuck E.

02:34.640 --> 02:37.780
Cheese. Yeah, I was trying to save up enough to get new mugs but they didn't have any mugs

02:37.780 --> 02:42.980
so I just saved my tickets. I had enough to purchase an Xbox game or a PS2 game but I

02:42.980 --> 02:48.100
just, I didn't. They were cool. I thought about getting that racing game that Rockstar

02:48.100 --> 02:53.780
puts out the Midnight Debeditions? I can never remember. Midnight Club 3 Debeditions. If

02:53.780 --> 02:57.380
you want to play that, I've got it, I think. Eh, maybe I'll borrow it and check it out.

02:57.380 --> 03:02.380
I need a good racing game. Now that I've given you back your copy of Silent Hill 4. Awesome.

03:02.380 --> 03:09.380
I need to play through that. Anyway, anything else? Puppies! Alright, Loki. So, I've been

03:10.460 --> 03:17.460
playing Burnout 3, as per usual, and then I got a copy of Burnout Legends for the PSP,

03:17.460 --> 03:21.840
So I've been playing that just to tide me over until I get burnout revenge this week

03:21.840 --> 03:27.800
Which I have on pre-order and already paid for and that one's gonna be awesome and burnout legends is cool

03:27.800 --> 03:31.960
It's kind of all three games of the original three put together plus, you know

03:32.640 --> 03:34.040
bonus stuff and

03:34.040 --> 03:39.240
I love it. I love you haven't shut up about this burnout game for like two months and then

03:39.880 --> 03:44.080
Then other things I've been playing Nintendogs. Of course. I have to take care of taco

03:44.080 --> 03:49.720
which I do find it a little annoying just because he's always hungry no

03:49.720 --> 03:55.200
matter how often I check it's like damn my dog never got that hungry I mean why

03:55.200 --> 03:58.680
can't you just leave the bowl out for him to eat the damn food and just leave

03:58.680 --> 04:02.320
it there I mean my dog never went through a bowl of water that quick I

04:02.320 --> 04:05.720
mean what the hell the water should be free why the hell that the buy water

04:05.720 --> 04:10.600
because your puppies need special water oh fuck by the dog store you have to

04:10.600 --> 04:14.280
special water you have to walk to the discount store and get it for you know

04:14.280 --> 04:18.400
uber cheap I want to why isn't there a store where you have to buy toys you have

04:18.400 --> 04:23.360
to find used toys in the street I mean is that a little weird that's all that

04:23.360 --> 04:28.520
crap um my friend got a Dalmatian that's cool yeah I heard Dalmatians were

04:28.520 --> 04:33.200
unlockable in it but found the fireman hat lucky got a Dalmatian just in the

04:33.200 --> 04:38.680
street somewhere Lana um she found you have to if you walk around the top

04:38.680 --> 04:44.000
perimeter uh-huh then you get more rare stuff oh interesting the further away

04:44.000 --> 04:46.720
you go from home the better stuff you know what the hell are those packages

04:46.720 --> 04:50.520
that I'll be walking also there's a box sitting on the ground you have to shake

04:50.520 --> 04:56.240
your leash over it pull your dog back and he'll grab it and open it use the

04:56.240 --> 04:59.480
leash to pull back I was shaking the hell out of my dog you thought that was

04:59.480 --> 05:02.600
like trying to kill it or something the fucker wouldn't pick up the package I've

05:02.600 --> 05:07.260
got two dogs I have I'm as well Welsh Corgi and I have Menchie who's a she but

05:07.260 --> 05:12.700
You know, I didn't realize I have anime dogs now, both of them, and they're both like fish sticks from the trash can.

05:12.700 --> 05:17.140
I have Oscar, my wiener dog, who has a Mario hat now, by the way, which I found in the street.

05:17.140 --> 05:24.780
I have Taco, who has a spike collar and news hat and some sunglasses.

05:24.780 --> 05:28.620
So I stuck with the spike collar because that was the least gay of all of them.

05:28.620 --> 05:31.020
I have the Japanese style collar on Menchie.

05:31.020 --> 05:35.980
I don't know, but anyways, other things I've been playing. I've been playing this game.

05:35.980 --> 05:42.620
I tried it out today. It was a dream TV. I want to say it's like dream mix TV

05:43.100 --> 05:48.540
World fighters and it's like all these different characters from Konami games Hudson's

05:49.460 --> 05:51.460
Hudson games and

05:51.620 --> 05:56.580
And Takara games and it's like you can do fights against it's basically like Super Smash Brothers

05:56.860 --> 05:59.540
But you can play as like Simon Belmont versus

05:59.540 --> 06:05.540
Octomus Prime! I mean, come on, that's crazy. That's rad, and Octomus Prime turns into a truck and runs over people.

06:05.540 --> 06:10.540
I find it funny, well, Takara is actually, Takara is a toy maker.

06:10.540 --> 06:16.540
And they're the ones who put out Transformers and like, Leekachan, the little Barbie doll in Japan.

06:16.540 --> 06:19.540
Yep, she's in it. Yeah, Leekachan's in it.

06:19.540 --> 06:24.540
And then Master Higgins from Adventure Island. I hear Bonk is unlockable, so it's pretty cool.

06:24.540 --> 06:27.540
cool. It's great. But it's not a new game, it's been out a little while. It's been out

06:27.540 --> 06:31.900
for a couple of years but it's just really weird and I was like, I got it. Sometimes

06:31.900 --> 06:36.940
we discover these little import gems a little late, so. I know, and hey, well you know we're

06:36.940 --> 06:42.740
not in Japan so we can't do this stuff advertised right away so hey, whatever, it's still good.

06:42.740 --> 06:47.740
And then of course I'm putting more money down on my 360 so waiting for that. So, lots

06:47.740 --> 06:52.780
of stuff. Sounds good. On Gamestop's site they have a thousand dollar like ultimate

06:52.780 --> 06:56.460
bundle. I think we talked about that the week you were here. Yeah, it was crazy.

06:56.460 --> 06:59.960
We were talking to the game publishers about that and they were laughing at how

06:59.960 --> 07:02.300
ridiculous and stupid it is, because most of those games

07:02.300 --> 07:05.420
aren't coming out at launch. I don't know how they're going to get this stuff,

07:05.420 --> 07:06.620
but it's not coming out

07:06.620 --> 07:11.000
at launch. Ooh, ouch. I want to think about that before you pre-order. The games get

07:11.000 --> 07:16.260
delayed all the time. Who is going to pay thousands of dollars for every game?

07:16.260 --> 07:20.420
Just buy them as they come out! Oh my god, I'm not interested in that one.

07:20.420 --> 07:25.540
Like I said, rich people. Rich people don't care. Paris Hilton. She doesn't care. She

07:25.540 --> 07:28.940
just wants her Xbox. I don't even know how to freaking use an Xbox. Anyway.

07:28.940 --> 07:34.900
She can make sausage. Moving on, my gaming week. I played mostly

07:34.900 --> 07:39.620
games that are kind of old. Speaking of rediscovering old games, I bought.hack a couple weeks ago

07:39.620 --> 07:43.800
and I've finally been getting into it this week and just playing through it. It's really

07:43.800 --> 07:50.380
a cool little game. I like the story. I like the idea of an MMO, but it's not. Like, it's

07:50.380 --> 07:52.240
I don't know it's kind of neat

07:52.240 --> 07:57.000
So the idea is if I'm dedicated enough, I'll play through all four parts at some point

07:57.000 --> 08:01.360
But let's get through part one first and see how much love I still have for it at the end of that

08:02.680 --> 08:04.320
Then what else?

08:04.320 --> 08:09.840
For my birthday a late birthday present, but that's alright. I like presents no matter what time of year

08:09.840 --> 08:14.320
It is I got Super Smash Brothers melee from Dark Sakura for the Gamecube

08:14.560 --> 08:20.160
Which is really I don't know why I never picked up this game before I think because like all my friends have it

08:20.160 --> 08:24.540
So I played it to death really but I was kind of sitting there cuz it's been like six months

08:24.820 --> 08:28.580
Since I played it. I was really sitting down with it today and going gosh

08:28.900 --> 08:31.740
This is seriously one of the greatest GameCube games they put out

08:31.740 --> 08:35.540
Yeah, I not just as one of the greatest next-gen games they put out period there

08:35.540 --> 08:39.380
It's just it's such a great game because there's so much to do in it

08:39.460 --> 08:45.260
You need to get all the little pieces and there's out the characters trophies. There's the

08:45.900 --> 08:48.240
Single-player mode where you do the adventure. There's

08:48.240 --> 08:53.400
There's the mini games, the little challenges, hit the targets, there's so many cool little

08:53.400 --> 08:58.920
things that just keep this game going and that's just, oh man, I just love the game.

08:58.920 --> 09:02.440
And I was also rediscovering F-Zero today, oh yeah, I was trying to, because I was hooking

09:02.440 --> 09:07.080
up the GameCube again and I wanted to try out some of these games to support widescreen

09:07.080 --> 09:08.080
TV.

09:08.080 --> 09:13.440
And I'm kind of upset though because Nintendo does not support component cable anymore.

09:13.440 --> 09:16.600
So if I want to hook up to my HDTV I have to use S-video.

09:16.600 --> 09:23.160
S video on the HDTV makes things look blurry compared to the Playstation 2. F0 looked blurry!

09:23.160 --> 09:26.760
And that's kind of upsetting because F0 is a really sharp looking game. It's an awesome

09:26.760 --> 09:31.080
looking game. I went to Nintendo's website to try and find a component cable. They stopped

09:31.080 --> 09:35.520
making them. Third party. And did you... I can't even find a third party cable at Fry's

09:35.520 --> 09:38.720
or anything. Actually I think that Licksync carries them. Maybe that's where I'm gonna

09:38.720 --> 09:44.360
have to go. But here's the other weird thing. Okay, since mid-2004, Nintendo stopped putting

09:44.360 --> 09:46.720
the digital output port on the back of the Gamecubes.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.880
If you didn't buy your Gamecube before,

09:48.880 --> 09:52.480
probably when the 79 price drop or whatever it's at now,

09:52.480 --> 09:54.240
your Gamecube doesn't have this port

09:54.240 --> 09:55.900
and you'll never have the component.

09:55.900 --> 10:00.360
It really irks me about Nintendo's lack of next definition,

10:00.360 --> 10:03.780
or next definition, next generation television support.

10:03.780 --> 10:05.240
If they're gonna go up to the next level

10:05.240 --> 10:07.080
with next gen gaming and we all heard that story

10:07.080 --> 10:07.920
a while back where they're saying

10:07.920 --> 10:09.800
Revolution's not gonna support HDTV,

10:09.800 --> 10:11.440
that really bothers me because,

10:11.440 --> 10:16.080
you know, after launch, a couple years after launch,

10:16.080 --> 10:19.400
a lot more people are going to be buying these HDTVs and they will be

10:19.400 --> 10:23.000
a bigger market share and Nintendo's going to be left out cold. Especially since,

10:23.000 --> 10:26.600
you know, I've got these pictures up of the PS3 that I took at E3

10:26.600 --> 10:30.320
with the two HDMI ports on the back. Oh, very sexy.

10:30.320 --> 10:33.340
Yeah, in case you have two

10:33.340 --> 10:37.120
HDTVs sitting next to each other.

10:37.120 --> 10:42.480
Like every like I I know I have five of them sitting next to each other so that'll be no problem

10:42.480 --> 10:48.980
That makes me think they'll remember the i-link. Mm-hmm, and that probably could be for dual output for multiplayer games

10:49.440 --> 10:54.460
Very possible very possible. So anyway, I still love you Nintendo, but come on get with the times

10:54.640 --> 11:01.200
It's time to start supporting HD a little better and I hope they change their mind on the revolution and and remake the component cables

11:01.520 --> 11:06.000
So while they're at it, they should drop the price on those plasma TVs because they're too fucking expensive

11:06.000 --> 11:10.780
You know, but I got mine at Costco, and it's not that it's not a it's not a plasma, but it's a

11:11.460 --> 11:13.460
HD here's a regular

11:13.820 --> 11:17.700
Costco doesn't advertise. Hmm, which is a very good advantage of buying things from there

11:18.140 --> 11:22.100
No matter how long you have owned something if anything on it goes wrong

11:22.140 --> 11:27.740
You can take it back and they have to take it back for a full refund or replacement. So

11:28.300 --> 11:30.300
Not even if it's ten years

11:30.980 --> 11:32.500
Yep

11:32.500 --> 11:35.820
So we're gamers just like you guys out there listening

11:35.820 --> 11:38.460
So we're just telling you guys where to get the good deal because that's what I I

11:38.780 --> 11:44.540
Felt and I shopped around for HDTV and I seriously felt Costco was the best deal. We like quality for our gaming goodness

11:46.020 --> 11:52.760
Let's talk about some news tonight going into next gen. Let's talk about the next generation Sonic

11:53.060 --> 11:55.060
They teased it a little bit at e3

11:55.060 --> 12:01.540
But now they are officially announcing that they are going to be making a next gen Sonic the Hedgehog games Sega, of course

12:01.540 --> 12:08.540
It's part of their Tokyo Game Show lineup, and Sonic the Hedgehog is going to be coming out for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.

12:08.540 --> 12:13.540
No word yet about a Revolution release, but nobody's really talking about the Revolution yet.

12:13.540 --> 12:15.540
I imagine they will early next year.

12:15.540 --> 12:21.540
By the way, Sega's also going to be showing them at Tokyo Game Show a mech game called ChromeHounds for the 360.

12:21.540 --> 12:23.540
Which looks sexy.

12:23.540 --> 12:29.540
And a Sonic Riders game for Xbox, PS2, and GameCube.

12:29.540 --> 12:33.500
cube chromehounds looks sexy I've seen the pictures of what is this I haven't

12:33.500 --> 12:37.840
it's like a mechs fighting game it's just like you know just like armored

12:37.840 --> 12:43.820
core or something like that just really good really awesome looking hmm I got

12:43.820 --> 12:46.980
pulled the screenshots they were looked they looked really awesome so where

12:46.980 --> 12:51.180
what site had the screenshots on that I remember it's not IGN that had the

12:51.180 --> 12:56.140
screenshots this is his monitor comes back up here if I remember correctly it

12:56.140 --> 13:09.380
It was, I want to say the, xbox360updates.com had the screenshots if I remember correctly.

13:09.380 --> 13:10.380
Looking this up right now.

13:10.380 --> 13:11.380
Oh, there it is.

13:11.380 --> 13:12.380
Yeah.

13:12.380 --> 13:16.980
They have screenshots and I'm going to pull one up here in the studio.

13:16.980 --> 13:25.200
Basically they're linking from gamespress.com, a press site.

13:25.200 --> 13:28.080
it looks it looks sexy looks pretty hot

13:28.080 --> 13:30.880
it should be interesting okay a follow-up to something else complain about

13:30.880 --> 13:33.840
earlier dark soccer you were researching and what you find you find

13:33.840 --> 13:37.760
licksang.com about thirty four dollars ninety cents they have GameCube

13:37.760 --> 13:39.000
component cables

13:39.000 --> 13:42.600
$34.90 man that's expensive for a cable

13:42.600 --> 13:45.960
might be worth it check if you have digital AV output port

13:45.960 --> 13:50.240
yep because we have a new GameCube you don't have it

13:50.240 --> 13:53.120
anyway I'm looking for the next-gen Sonic that little video that you were

13:53.120 --> 13:56.720
showing before the podcast look you look very sexy so I didn't get a chance to go

13:56.720 --> 13:59.340
to the Sega theater at this year's e3 because it was another one of those

13:59.340 --> 14:03.180
things that had a line oh no actually the line for the Sega theater yeah I

14:03.180 --> 14:06.660
spent less than 10 minutes in it yeah I when I was looking I was looking to go

14:06.660 --> 14:10.760
in the last day and it just was wrapping around the thing and I just I was I was

14:10.760 --> 14:14.400
around the other side of it less than 10 minute wait seriously

14:14.400 --> 14:18.680
darn you and if you were waiting in line they came by and gave you t-shirts or

14:18.680 --> 14:23.320
plushies but I lost out maybe I'll do it they had this nice home theater

14:23.320 --> 14:27.720
seatings in there by the way oh sorry so sorry and just watching it on that

14:27.720 --> 14:33.240
screen they had oh we're like pretty I didn't play Phantasy Star Universe so

14:33.240 --> 14:37.040
you know that's cool okay I got the I got the okay from the

14:37.040 --> 14:42.200
soon-to-be wife because our wedding day is gonna be about two weeks before e3

14:42.200 --> 14:46.520
mm-hmm she says as long as my company is paying for me to go it's okay you got

14:46.520 --> 14:53.000
permission to go to E3! Yay! Alright! Congratulations. Actually, about Sega, one other thing, just

14:53.000 --> 14:58.500
a little thing, is that, you know, the Sega Ages re-releases? Mm-hmm. The Sega Age 2500?

14:58.500 --> 15:02.860
Gunstar Heroes is being re-released. Cool. Sega Ages. I'm gonna try, actually, I've got

15:02.860 --> 15:06.220
two of them I've got to try out right now. I can't remember what, I remember one of them

15:06.220 --> 15:11.540
was Virtua Racing, the Sega Ages for that, I've tried that, and I can't remember what

15:11.540 --> 15:14.740
the other one is for the life of me, but it was another really good game. I've got Fantasy

15:14.740 --> 15:17.740
Star, Space Harrier, and Fantasy Zone.

15:17.740 --> 15:19.740
I want to check out Fantasy Star. I bet that's cool.

15:19.740 --> 15:21.740
I'll bring it over. We've got to save about halfway through it.

15:21.740 --> 15:23.740
But yeah, it looks really nice.

15:23.740 --> 15:29.740
Nice. Moving on, of course, two very, very highly talked about games this year when it comes to handhelds

15:29.740 --> 15:32.740
are the two puzzlers, Luminous and Meteos.

15:32.740 --> 15:38.740
And, of course, very similar because they are developed by the same guy.

15:38.740 --> 15:43.740
Luminous and Meteos are actually going to be re-released on one handheld system.

15:43.740 --> 15:48.020
So they'll both be available on one handheld system finally. That handheld

15:48.020 --> 15:48.580
system?

15:48.580 --> 15:53.900
A Neo Geo Pocket Color. No. A cellular telephone will be the handheld system.

15:53.900 --> 15:58.300
In other words, wah wah wah. In other words, forget it because cell phone game

15:58.300 --> 15:58.960
ports

15:58.960 --> 16:03.220
suck. It's cute for the nostalgia value for about five minutes

16:03.220 --> 16:06.460
but for the most part, at least here in America, are cell phones. The

16:06.460 --> 16:10.740
cell phone games suck. And the single N-Gage owner out there rejoices.

16:10.740 --> 16:14.180
No, it's not coming out for Engage. It's a cell phone.

16:14.180 --> 16:16.940
They play mobile phone games, though.

16:16.940 --> 16:21.860
Snake for life. Snake was the only good cell phone game.

16:21.860 --> 16:26.540
First quarter 2006 when Q Entertainment will be...

16:26.540 --> 16:30.900
I'm sorry, not Q Entertainment, Gameloft signed the agreement with Q Entertainment

16:30.900 --> 16:35.880
to put these out first quarter 2006. You guys remember, this was something we had

16:35.880 --> 16:38.960
talked about when our podcast first started, I think it was like back in January.

16:38.960 --> 16:45.640
Playboy magazine did a spread featuring the girls of gaming or they had topless blood rain and Melina

16:46.120 --> 16:51.460
Guess what in October? They're doing it again. I'm gonna buy that issue just for the show

16:53.080 --> 16:57.140
Who is the sacrifice who is yeah, I owe the sacrifices you have to make

16:57.760 --> 16:59.760
Who are the characters you will be seeing in?

17:00.040 --> 17:06.320
October's Playboy in the buff the digital buff or whatever one call I feel so stupid talking about this seriously

17:06.320 --> 17:12.700
this is I can't believe it was I can't believe that it was so popular the first

17:12.700 --> 17:16.580
time they're doing it again I I honestly feel sorry they're gonna have the hot

17:16.580 --> 17:21.020
coffee mod uncensored on this I I have no idea but here's some of the games

17:21.020 --> 17:25.200
Jackie who is a cheerleader in Midway's blitz the league

17:25.200 --> 17:31.420
Carla Valenti from Atari's indigo prophecy Capcom's dark watch will have

17:31.420 --> 17:35.140
Cassidy and Tala who was a vampire

17:35.140 --> 17:37.760
female I might add that Cassidy was

17:37.760 --> 17:39.820
killed off in about the first five

17:39.820 --> 17:41.640
minutes of the game her head ripped

17:41.640 --> 17:44.040
clean from her body thank you for

17:44.040 --> 17:46.480
sharing a bit of irony to that last

17:46.480 --> 17:51.920
issue made it on CNN money really whoa

17:51.920 --> 17:54.320
oh my gosh they actually have an article

17:54.320 --> 17:56.240
there is on CNN money yeah hey whatever

17:56.240 --> 17:59.000
make some money huh and of course of

17:59.000 --> 18:05.000
Of course, um, Playboy, uh, Playboy Mansion Private Party will have a couple of their models in the spread.

18:05.000 --> 18:12.000
But, um, Namco doesn't want to be left out. They'll have a character from Hellgate London, and of course, Sony's God of War getting in on it as well.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.000
And what's funny, everybody's joke about this is they're all,

18:14.000 --> 18:16.000
What the hell is Hellgate London?

18:17.000 --> 18:19.000
They're all, we don't even know what that game is.

18:19.000 --> 18:22.000
I've actually never heard of this myself, and I'm kind of reading this going,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.000
Okay, must be some game I just haven't heard of. I can't play them all.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.000
Anyway.

18:28.000 --> 18:30.840
What was the original spread called before?

18:30.840 --> 18:32.000
I don't know.

18:32.000 --> 18:33.960
Digital, I just closed the story.

18:33.960 --> 18:34.800
I don't care.

18:34.800 --> 18:36.520
Don't do any more research on this.

18:36.520 --> 18:37.620
It lowers your IQ.

18:39.240 --> 18:41.240
This is a very interesting story

18:41.240 --> 18:43.840
I think we ought to talk about here.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.480
Because this affects us here in California.

18:45.480 --> 18:46.520
Of course, Orange Lounge Radio,

18:46.520 --> 18:49.280
we're based out of Sacramento, California.

18:49.280 --> 18:51.520
But we do have a worldwide audience.

18:51.520 --> 18:53.400
But this is something that's going on in California.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.280
And California's kind of been known to set the tone

18:55.280 --> 18:56.480
for the rest of the nation sometimes

18:56.480 --> 18:58.120
when it comes to certain bills.

18:58.120 --> 19:01.200
Assembly Bill 1179.

19:01.200 --> 19:04.880
This is the bill that Assemblyman Leland Yee

19:04.880 --> 19:07.520
was kind of behind a couple months ago

19:07.520 --> 19:09.720
when the hot coffee thing was really big.

19:09.720 --> 19:13.280
It prohibits retailers from selling violent games to minors

19:13.280 --> 19:17.040
or else they'll be fined $1,000 for each violation.

19:17.040 --> 19:20.840
It passed in the California Senate by a vote of 22 to nine

19:20.840 --> 19:23.640
and it passed in the Assembly 65 to seven.

19:23.640 --> 19:27.440
So it's now sitting on Governor Schwarzenegger's,

19:27.440 --> 19:29.520
and speaking of feeling like an idiot saying something,

19:29.520 --> 19:32.280
Governor Schwarzenegger's desk right now

19:32.280 --> 19:33.320
waiting to be signed.

19:33.320 --> 19:36.940
He must sign or veto the bill by October 9th.

19:36.940 --> 19:40.680
So no word yet on which way he'll go,

19:40.680 --> 19:43.920
but probably considering the fairly overwhelming support,

19:43.920 --> 19:45.800
he will probably sign this bill,

19:45.800 --> 19:50.440
and it would go into effect January 1st, 2006.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.680
By the way, the bill will also require

19:52.680 --> 19:59.720
the games be labeled as being for sale to adults only by a solid 18-sticker no smaller

19:59.720 --> 20:04.040
than 2 inches by 2 inches on the front of the package.

20:04.040 --> 20:07.160
So that's very interesting because if you think about it, a Game Boy Advance game is

20:07.160 --> 20:11.200
only 5 inches by 5 inches of the packaging, so a little 18-sticker would take up like

20:11.200 --> 20:12.620
half the box.

20:12.620 --> 20:20.280
The bill also makes no mention of the current ESRB system, so the bill defines its own means

20:20.280 --> 20:24.280
of a violent video game saying a video game in which the range of options

20:24.280 --> 20:28.920
available to a player includes killing, maiming, dismembering, or sexually

20:28.920 --> 20:34.820
assaulting an image of a human being. Wow, that goes for all of them. They're very

20:34.820 --> 20:40.880
very interesting. Bye bye, like all fighting games, you know, it's retarded. Very

20:40.880 --> 20:46.480
interesting. It'll be interesting to see what happens with this bill. So we'll see

20:46.480 --> 20:49.120
come the new year because we're expecting that Governor Schwarzenegger is

20:49.120 --> 20:58.360
going to sign it. Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks is going gold. This was a game that I played

20:58.360 --> 21:03.360
a little bit at E3 and I actually kind of enjoyed it. Didn't think I would, but it's

21:03.360 --> 21:07.900
actually kind of cool. It's a neat little, it's not like a typical Mortal Kombat game

21:07.900 --> 21:13.180
because it's more of like a 3D adventure type thing, or I shouldn't say 3D, but a 3D ISO

21:13.180 --> 21:18.940
perspective type game, where you're just going around killing things, which will probably

21:18.940 --> 21:25.940
be one of the first games to carry an 18 sticker, by the way. And that game has recently gone

21:25.940 --> 21:31.600
gold, and it'll be coming out for $49.99 on September 19th. That's next week.

21:31.600 --> 21:34.600
Our UK listeners get it on the 23rd. Very cool.

21:34.600 --> 21:38.600
It's not next week. It'll be a week after Monday.

21:38.600 --> 21:43.720
Oh, okay. Ha! Anyway, and the shows go out on Monday, remember?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.720
That's right. This is a Monday show, remember?

21:45.720 --> 21:50.520
magic of podcasting anyway dark soccer what kind of news do you have for us tonight well

21:50.520 --> 21:57.280
just checking the uk release dates you know um i did see on the 16th uh e6 comes out on

21:57.280 --> 22:05.680
playstation 2 burnout revenge on the 23rd um er the game for pc on the 23rd there's

22:05.680 --> 22:12.080
some pretty neat stuff medios in the 23rd lots of stuff coming out on the 23rd um including

22:12.080 --> 22:18.480
uh, Myst 5, Mortal Kombat, um, Rugby Challenge 2006, and Sniper Elite. There's some pretty

22:18.480 --> 22:23.120
good stuff. Actually, uh, Advanced Wars DS comes out on the 30th there too, as well as

22:23.120 --> 22:27.120
Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow on the 29th. Advanced Wars DS is one of those games I got to pick

22:27.120 --> 22:30.160
up. I've been hearing a lot, a lot of good things about it, so I wanted to check it out.

22:30.160 --> 22:34.560
If you've got the other two, um, it has a tie-in on there. Actually, you get more options

22:34.560 --> 22:38.580
in the shop. Oh, like if you put the Advanced game in the bottom slot? Yep. Very cool! I'm

22:38.580 --> 22:43.620
liking this DS interacting with the other ports good another game is

22:43.620 --> 22:49.260
checking out a yahoo uk and ireland games is a Winx Club Konami is putting

22:49.260 --> 22:56.580
out a Winx Club game oh hooray it's so cute I guess I don't know and then

22:56.580 --> 23:01.860
lastly a date for Animal Crossing DS which is going to be renamed wild world

23:01.860 --> 23:09.100
for a release says first quarter 2006. Wait, so the whole game itself is gonna be called

23:09.100 --> 23:15.700
Wild World in Europe? I think it's a subtitle. So it's Animal Crossing Wild World instead

23:15.700 --> 23:23.060
of Animal Crossing DS officially? However, you know, of course we're getting it in December.

23:23.060 --> 23:27.300
Which is later than it was supposed to be, by the way. I'd rather wait a little bit while

23:27.300 --> 23:33.740
for a better quality. I suppose. I was a little weird with what I saw at E3. I kind of liked,

23:33.740 --> 23:37.780
you know, of course I liked the nationwide wireless thing, but it didn't, I was expecting

23:37.780 --> 23:42.740
kind of a port of the GameCube version, and it really wasn't. It was really different.

23:42.740 --> 23:47.300
So I just, I hope it has that fun factor, because that's really what it's all about,

23:47.300 --> 23:56.300
right? So we'll see. Anyway, anything else? Just up on the Silent Hill movie. Oh, cool.

23:56.300 --> 24:02.300
Let me see, because I found a release date on it, and I'm going to take this as a tentative date because I haven't seen too much official.

24:02.300 --> 24:06.300
According to bloodydisgusting.com, it says...

24:06.300 --> 24:07.300
Great website name.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.300
Well, it's...

24:08.300 --> 24:09.300
I know.

24:09.300 --> 24:11.300
If you want your zombie movies, that's the place to go.

24:11.300 --> 24:12.300
Right.

24:12.300 --> 24:14.300
April 21st, 2006.

24:14.300 --> 24:16.300
I'll be there.

24:16.300 --> 24:18.300
You know I will be there.

24:18.300 --> 24:19.300
Absolutely.

24:19.300 --> 24:23.440
And also there was an article an interview up on IGN

24:25.580 --> 24:31.100
Where it was I can never pronounce this guy's name Patrick Teutopolis

24:32.900 --> 24:39.500
Was stating that the director had told him to make in fact, I'm gonna quote Patrick

24:39.500 --> 24:44.140
I want those guys to look like they are made of plastic which is exactly the opposite of what we try to do usually

24:44.140 --> 24:53.040
usually. They're going for a very surreal, very, this can't really happen look. And

24:53.040 --> 24:58.020
then a lot of what they're trying to do is, they're having to redevelop some technology

24:58.020 --> 24:59.020
for it.

24:59.020 --> 25:01.940
Please be a video game movie that doesn't suck. Please, please, please.

25:01.940 --> 25:06.540
Checking the scenery though, it's at least going to visually be right. Reading the storyline

25:06.540 --> 25:09.940
so far, it's going to be pretty dead on.

25:09.940 --> 25:10.940
We'll see.

25:10.940 --> 25:11.940
All right.

25:11.940 --> 25:14.960
Those of you guys that listen to our three hour program on Sunday nights, Orange Lounge

25:14.960 --> 25:19.680
Radio Live, which is broadcast through our station at Live 365, for more information

25:19.680 --> 25:20.960
check out OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.300
You heard this.

25:22.300 --> 25:27.720
One of our listeners actually called in saying that on Live Journal he had seen a picture

25:27.720 --> 25:33.240
of somebody who had picked up Wee Hart Katamari from Target this weekend.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.480
Wee Hart Katamari is not supposed to be out until when?

25:37.480 --> 25:38.480
Like later this month.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.480
The 21st.

25:39.480 --> 25:41.600
is when the Wii Heart Katamari was supposed to be on.

25:41.600 --> 25:46.440
So we were curious if Target broke street or if this game, if this image was photoshopped

25:46.440 --> 25:47.440
or what have you.

25:47.440 --> 25:51.720
And on Target's website it says they're not even doing any of the ship, they're not gonna

25:51.720 --> 25:54.020
have the game through their website until the 22nd.

25:54.020 --> 25:58.120
So we looked at the receipt and we figured out which Target store it was that was selling

25:58.120 --> 26:00.640
the game early so we gave them a call.

26:00.640 --> 26:04.560
So here's a clip from the live 3 hour program of what happened when we gave this Target

26:04.560 --> 26:08.840
store a call asking if they had any Wii Heart Katamari in stock.

26:08.840 --> 26:13.120
Keep in mind, um, this was made on September 11th at about 8 in the evening.

26:14.580 --> 26:15.880
**phone ringing**

26:18.780 --> 26:19.280
Electrometers?

26:19.740 --> 26:22.840
Uh, yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock.

26:22.840 --> 26:24.680
It's We Love Katamari.

26:25.780 --> 26:26.680
Let me check, hang on.

26:27.980 --> 26:28.480
Yeah, SD?

26:28.780 --> 26:29.920
Those are on the next aisle.

26:33.120 --> 26:34.120
I'm sorry, what was the game again?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.120
It's We Love Katamari.

26:36.120 --> 26:39.320
Yeah, we have one left.

26:39.320 --> 26:40.320
You do have one left in stock?

26:40.320 --> 26:41.320
Yes, we do.

26:41.320 --> 26:42.320
Okay, great.

26:42.320 --> 26:43.320
Thank you.

26:43.320 --> 26:44.320
Uh-huh.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.320
All right, bye-bye.

26:45.320 --> 26:46.320
So get that.

26:46.320 --> 26:49.460
This store actually admitted that they had one left in stock on the shelf.

26:49.460 --> 26:53.000
Go figure.

26:53.000 --> 26:58.680
So some copies of We Heart Katamari are getting out there a little bit early, so hopefully

26:58.680 --> 27:02.160
some of our listeners of the live program ran out there to the store and probably picked

27:02.160 --> 27:04.320
up that last copy already, but we'll see.

27:04.320 --> 27:07.700
I did confirm that at least none of the local GameStops have gotten it.

27:07.700 --> 27:11.280
None of the local GameStops. We actually called some targets around here. One of the targets

27:11.280 --> 27:14.860
around here said that they would be putting the game out on shelves Tuesday.

27:14.860 --> 27:18.020
Yep. Which is very interesting because the game wasn't supposed to be out until the 21st.

27:18.020 --> 27:22.220
So are they doing an early... did the release get bumped up? Who knows?

27:22.220 --> 27:26.340
Not officially. But if you are hearing stories about We Heart Katamari

27:26.340 --> 27:27.500
getting out there early

27:27.500 --> 27:31.540
it is possible. We called them and sure enough they're selling it.

27:31.540 --> 27:34.980
Moving on, let's get to the mailbag.

27:34.980 --> 27:39.060
Let's do tonight's mailbag, shall we? Of course you can always send us an email

27:39.060 --> 27:44.860
togo, t-o-g-o, at orangelaungeradio.com

27:44.860 --> 27:49.520
We only have one email tonight. I'm reading this one, correct? Yes?

27:49.520 --> 27:53.720
Okay, I'll go ahead. That's alright. We got an email from

27:53.720 --> 27:57.500
Aaron C. Is this the same one we read a couple weeks ago?

27:57.500 --> 27:59.500
I think so. Is this the same person?

27:59.500 --> 28:02.500
This makes me very regretful that I wasn't here last week.

28:02.500 --> 28:06.500
I'm sorry. Well, let's read it. Let's see what's on Aaron's mind. This is a follow-up mail.

28:06.500 --> 28:15.500
Seriously, once again, you frothed with rage about parents' responsibilities, totally ignoring the point that consumers have a right to be informed.

28:15.500 --> 28:23.500
To utilize your oft-used movie analogy, let's say Paramount produces a flick called Loki Has Brain Damage.

28:23.500 --> 28:28.660
It goes through the MPAA and ends up rated R for violence, foul language and excessive

28:28.660 --> 28:29.660
retardation.

28:29.660 --> 28:34.260
I always allow my 12 year old to see R rated movies so I let him go.

28:34.260 --> 28:39.140
Now unbeknownst to the rating board, Paramount secretly slips 5 minutes of close up anal

28:39.140 --> 28:41.580
penetration at the end of the credits.

28:41.580 --> 28:47.240
This hot anal action actually means that this film should have received an NC-17 rating.

28:47.240 --> 28:51.660
I didn't want my kid to see this, I had been duped as a consumer.

28:51.660 --> 28:54.200
This is an identical situation to the Hot Coffee mod.

28:54.200 --> 28:58.780
If a parent decides that they will allow their children to play a game rated M, that is not

28:58.780 --> 29:02.160
the same as allowing their children to play a game rated AO.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
Get it?

29:03.160 --> 29:04.160
Loki?

29:04.160 --> 29:05.160
Wrong.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.340
That's completely wrong.

29:07.340 --> 29:11.060
Because unlike the Hot Coffee mod, you have to put in external, you have to have a third

29:11.060 --> 29:12.380
party cheat device in order to see it.

29:12.380 --> 29:20.060
In other words, I would have had to purchase special goggles to watch this movie to decode

29:20.060 --> 29:24.300
the image that was on there to see the anal penetration.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.300
That is the difference.

29:25.300 --> 29:26.900
DarkSakura, you wanted to respond to this earlier.

29:26.900 --> 29:33.540
Actually, that is a very good point, however, I can see it both ways.

29:33.540 --> 29:39.300
In one way, let the buyer beware.

29:39.300 --> 29:47.100
There is always a degree of caution that someone has to make with any purchase.

29:47.100 --> 29:54.780
really and I think that when you're dealing with how many different

29:54.780 --> 30:00.000
departments you have with the game publisher being that I know many people

30:00.000 --> 30:06.200
now who work for various publishers you what the what the programmers leave in

30:06.200 --> 30:12.240
is not necessarily going to be found by the testers unless you know you've got

30:12.240 --> 30:18.000
true the testers are playing on debug units and they are meant to break the

30:18.000 --> 30:22.300
game every way they can do everything possible and are given usually a set

30:22.300 --> 30:26.880
assignment for how the game should be played when they're testing it. However

30:26.880 --> 30:32.800
something that is programmed into a game that has had that bit of programming

30:32.800 --> 30:38.560
removed to access it on average is not going to be found. So it is very likely

30:38.560 --> 30:44.440
that nobody except the programmers had any idea that this was in the game and

30:44.440 --> 30:50.000
though some random person it could have been found by some random person who

30:50.000 --> 30:55.360
said oh well look what I just found coding for in the game you know and if

30:55.360 --> 30:59.440
they find it on PC of course you know the PlayStation 1 came after the PC one

30:59.440 --> 31:03.360
when they said oh it's here let's see if it's in here or it could just be a

31:03.360 --> 31:08.240
program I did I that's a very similar thing to what I've always said is that

31:08.240 --> 31:09.980
that the programmers put it in there

31:09.980 --> 31:11.480
and they made a decision to take it out.

31:11.480 --> 31:13.860
I imagine somebody at Rockstar said,

31:13.860 --> 31:16.100
you know what, this is crossing the line,

31:16.100 --> 31:18.580
this is gonna get us an AO, take this out of the game.

31:18.580 --> 31:19.460
And what the programmers did,

31:19.460 --> 31:21.380
instead of actually physically removing it from the game,

31:21.380 --> 31:22.540
they just took out the pointer.

31:22.540 --> 31:23.380
Easier, right?

31:23.380 --> 31:24.200
It's a lot easier.

31:24.200 --> 31:26.300
And it also keeps, instead of having

31:26.300 --> 31:28.060
to rewrite part of the code,

31:28.060 --> 31:29.380
it's a lot easier to remove part of it

31:29.380 --> 31:30.820
and make sure that your game ships on date.

31:30.820 --> 31:32.100
And you know what, and I bet you,

31:32.100 --> 31:33.620
but here's the thing, you know,

31:33.620 --> 31:35.820
so to try and get past this here,

31:35.820 --> 31:36.700
because we could talk about this

31:36.700 --> 31:37.740
until we're blue in the face,

31:37.740 --> 31:40.300
rest assured this will never happen again this is not the first game this

31:40.300 --> 31:41.180
has happened with either

31:41.180 --> 31:45.500
oh no no no bloody roar 3 yeah you put it in debug mode you get

31:45.500 --> 31:49.620
necky you know masturbatory photos of the characters in the game

31:49.620 --> 31:53.460
I'd even talked about last week a little more innocent the hidden song in DDR

31:53.460 --> 31:54.180
quote-unquote

31:54.180 --> 31:58.500
um although some folks have actually sent me an email that linked me to a

31:58.500 --> 32:00.340
thread on DDR freak where

32:00.340 --> 32:04.200
some inside sources are saying that that song is actually supposed to be

32:04.200 --> 32:05.000
unlockable

32:05.000 --> 32:08.840
just nobody's figured it out yet but I don't know if nobody's unlocked it at

32:08.840 --> 32:11.000
this point I don't think they're going to so whatever

32:11.000 --> 32:15.360
but the point is is that basically

32:15.360 --> 32:19.920
it was lazy programming issue and it's brought this whole debate to the front

32:19.920 --> 32:23.680
I think that there was a large portion of Rockstar that didn't realize that this

32:23.680 --> 32:26.480
was going to be found they did not intend for this be found it did

32:26.480 --> 32:30.000
now they're taking the heat for it and rest assured this lazy programming incident will

32:30.000 --> 32:32.560
never happen again because that testing process will be changed to prevent this

32:32.560 --> 32:33.280
from ever happening

32:33.280 --> 32:36.160
to some- a future game because Rockstar's taking a lot of heat for it.

32:36.160 --> 32:36.660
Oh, on top of that.

32:36.660 --> 32:39.200
And, you know, should they, shouldn't they? I don't know.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.600
I mean, I- it's- it's not- not an easy answer because you could say,

32:43.600 --> 32:47.600
were they ignorant or did they know what they were doing? We don't know.

32:47.600 --> 32:52.160
And in the movie analogy, sorry, um, remember The Rescuers?

32:53.120 --> 32:53.680
With the little-

32:53.680 --> 32:57.200
Oh, yeah, they always say they put sex things in the Disney movies and stuff.

32:57.200 --> 32:58.640
And they did in Roger Rabbit.

32:58.640 --> 32:59.840
Yeah, yeah, yeah, but, you know.

32:59.840 --> 33:04.080
but the thing is is that the only way that this would have ever really been

33:04.080 --> 33:08.800
the average eye is going to see it as a blip across the screen right like one time i would

33:08.800 --> 33:14.160
i was watching a cartoon that i used to tape when i lived in alabama i don't remember what it was

33:14.160 --> 33:19.440
and i saw the color changed weirdly i went back and freeze framed it on a picture of the american

33:19.440 --> 33:25.920
flag that the animators just happened to stick in there interesting or even places where there

33:25.920 --> 33:29.440
were missing frames the average person isn't going to see that unless they take an effort

33:29.440 --> 33:41.440
And if this person is saying that they monitor what their kids are watching, obviously for them to go have a third party cheat device, cheat in the game, then go into this, you're not monitoring what your kids are doing.

33:41.440 --> 33:47.440
So you know what, you're the blame still, and you know what, you can't come and bitch about Rockstar saying,

33:47.440 --> 33:53.120
about you know Rockstar saying oh no oh this wasn't supposed to be the game the

33:53.120 --> 33:57.980
game's maturity it's for over 17 you know what adults only is over 18 one

33:57.980 --> 34:02.020
year difference we're talking nothing that's like the difference between PG

34:02.020 --> 34:06.960
and pg-13 there is really no difference and you know what you really should be

34:06.960 --> 34:09.360
monitoring what your kids are watching you shouldn't be playing the games the

34:09.360 --> 34:12.280
first place if you let them go the r-rated movies anyways they're probably

34:12.280 --> 34:17.080
seeing real boobies in those r-rated films and this pixelated representation

34:17.080 --> 34:21.880
of what is supposed to be sex and mind you the Carl Johnson character the main

34:21.880 --> 34:26.480
male in it does not get naked in this because it was unfinished does not get

34:26.480 --> 34:31.640
naked only the woman so it's not even oh my god they saw you know penis and ass

34:31.640 --> 34:38.040
you know it's just pixelated boobies okay and mature rated games like God of

34:38.040 --> 34:42.040
War they have you know non pixelated boobies it's full rendered you know

34:42.040 --> 34:46.040
high-res boobies in there and there's actual sex games in that but do you hear

34:46.040 --> 34:47.280
them complain about this

34:47.280 --> 34:50.880
no why because rockstar they're going to come after but I guess you're fine with

34:50.880 --> 34:51.320
your kids

34:51.320 --> 34:54.400
the reason why is because

34:54.400 --> 34:59.000
you knew that in God of War this you did not nobody knew that there would be the

34:59.000 --> 34:59.640
sex thing

34:59.640 --> 35:04.080
in the game I'm sorry you know calling you know the racist people murdering the

35:04.080 --> 35:07.720
blacks and stuff in the gang violence that's okay but you know

35:07.720 --> 35:10.800
boobies not okay I'm sorry I'm just saying

35:10.800 --> 35:14.800
but in defense though I do think that

35:14.800 --> 35:18.720
Rockstar was at fault. Because of a lazy programmer, yes.

35:18.720 --> 35:22.920
Exactly, and no matter who it is in the company, as long as that game was released

35:22.920 --> 35:23.840
that company has

35:23.840 --> 35:27.480
a legal requirement to make sure that the

35:27.480 --> 35:31.080
product that they put out on the market is exactly what they're advertising.

35:31.080 --> 35:34.840
I agree and that's where I think you're getting a little off Loki is because

35:34.840 --> 35:38.000
that this is the issue the issue is not oh my god somebody saw digitized

35:38.000 --> 35:38.460
boobies

35:38.460 --> 35:42.180
but the issue is is that Rockstar did not tell anyone that was in the game

35:42.180 --> 35:43.360
whereas with God of War

35:43.360 --> 35:46.480
they said yeah full-on female boobies everywhere

35:46.480 --> 35:50.440
K but with this game they said they didn't sell there's no sexy sure you

35:50.440 --> 35:52.360
can blow people's heads off with rocket launchers whatever

35:52.360 --> 35:56.120
but there is no hardcore sex in the game and turned out bonus there was hard

35:56.120 --> 35:56.640
course

35:56.640 --> 35:59.780
X am I am I ever alright as you know because

35:59.780 --> 36:05.320
I'm going to be a parent in a couple years mmm when you buy something that

36:05.320 --> 36:09.480
and trust me I remember fully well with devious little child I was

36:09.480 --> 36:13.480
That's not the end of your responsibility.

36:13.480 --> 36:16.840
There is such a thing called maintenance.

36:16.840 --> 36:20.520
Alright, we gotta, we gotta move on, because we could beat this topic into the ground.

36:20.520 --> 36:23.900
It's just, you know, I hate hearing you. I say from here on out, no more hot coffee,

36:23.900 --> 36:27.760
ever. Or take it to the forums. The only, yeah, put it, go, go to our website, go to

36:27.760 --> 36:32.240
orangellensradio.com. Send Loki a personal email, loki at orangellensradio.com.

36:32.240 --> 36:37.120
I'm just personally sick of these people going, I'm your rockstar, didn't tell me what's in the game!

36:37.120 --> 36:38.680
It doesn't matter, you don't read the label anyways,

36:38.680 --> 36:41.200
because it says don't, no, not suited for kids

36:41.200 --> 36:44.720
under the age of 17, so you're ignoring the label as is,

36:44.720 --> 36:45.560
it wouldn't matter if they said

36:45.560 --> 36:47.760
there was people getting fucked in the game.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.040
It doesn't matter.

36:49.040 --> 36:51.520
Some people, language is their thing,

36:51.520 --> 36:52.880
some people, violence is their thing,

36:52.880 --> 36:54.080
some people, sex is their thing,

36:54.080 --> 36:56.720
and there was certainly violence being advertised.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.000
I really think that in the end,

36:58.000 --> 36:59.560
it shouldn't be the responsibility

36:59.560 --> 37:01.880
of the video game company to censor their product.

37:01.880 --> 37:03.980
However, I do think they should make sure

37:03.980 --> 37:05.640
that the consumer is fully aware

37:05.640 --> 37:06.680
of the product that they're purchasing.

37:06.680 --> 37:11.120
can agree with that alright moving on moving on let's talk about coffee I ever

37:11.120 --> 37:16.120
want to see is the kind of get Starbucks alright let's move on speaking of Grand

37:16.120 --> 37:21.240
Theft Auto San Andreas that re-release without the coffee mod it will be coming

37:21.240 --> 37:26.720
out next week which I suppose as a little footnote to the story look how

37:26.720 --> 37:30.800
long it took for that patch to come out that's how long this game would have

37:30.800 --> 37:34.160
been delayed if they'd gone back and done what they should have done just

37:34.160 --> 37:44.080
just food for thought murder murder in China based on a MMORPG according to the

37:44.080 --> 37:49.220
Beijing Morning Post a young woman has been charged with murdering her fiance

37:49.220 --> 37:55.720
for quote too much time playing online games I think that's it no more online

37:55.720 --> 38:02.420
games for the Chinese ever stop the woman in question apparently got fed up

38:02.420 --> 38:08.060
with her unemployed fiance for spending more time online than looking for a job

38:08.060 --> 38:13.060
so he could pay for the wedding so on August 6th allegedly she did the deed

38:13.060 --> 38:18.380
you know what if I had been spending all this time married to Dan or engaged to

38:18.380 --> 38:23.420
Dan and he wasn't getting off his ass looking for well actually we did spend a

38:23.420 --> 38:28.300
year like that then again he had he had money and that we had the money in the

38:28.300 --> 38:32.100
bank to afford it we could afford for him to not work however you know it had

38:32.100 --> 38:36.300
it had that money not been there and you know I was having to support him or he

38:36.300 --> 38:42.380
was just sitting on his ass I'd left him shit yeah it's because I have a brain in

38:42.380 --> 38:45.460
my head and I use it oh it's just interesting I mean instead of dumping

38:45.460 --> 38:50.620
his ass she shot him or whatever she did say I don't want to know either way

38:50.620 --> 38:56.060
you're without him you know and now you've got a deal with finding a date

38:56.060 --> 38:59.020
when you get out of the prison I guess only they were playing more the hot

38:59.020 --> 39:01.780
coffee mod they would have learned that they can solve their problems by having

39:01.780 --> 39:08.700
no more hot coffee stop right now hot coffee talk is banned from the podcast

39:08.700 --> 39:15.220
all right you know what we I'm gonna make a game called hot cop more than

39:15.220 --> 39:19.020
ever we need some of dark Sakura's advice column because if we stayed

39:19.020 --> 39:23.860
inside and played video games all day long we'd have no time to um get

39:23.860 --> 39:29.460
murdered by our fiancees so dark Sakura has her advice column for us and dark

39:29.460 --> 39:32.660
Sakura what are you going to be telling us about tonight today's bit of advice

39:32.660 --> 39:39.380
is how to drown your co-host of hot coffee oh wait how to escape from a car

39:39.380 --> 39:44.420
hanging over the edge of the cliff number one do not shift your weight or

39:44.420 --> 39:49.100
make any sudden movements to if the front doors are still over land use

39:49.100 --> 39:51.700
these doors to make your escape regardless of which way your car is

39:51.700 --> 40:00.700
2. If the front doors are over the edge, proceed slowly to the rear of the car.

40:00.700 --> 40:05.900
3. Reassess your situation and make your escape. Will opening the rear doors cause the car

40:05.900 --> 40:10.860
to slide? If not, open them slowly and get out. Otherwise, use a steering wheel lock

40:10.860 --> 40:15.180
or screwdriver to break the window and climb out as quickly as possible.

40:15.180 --> 40:24.340
My final piece of advice, I have two actually, either don't pull a Thelma and Louise or make

40:24.340 --> 40:27.720
sure that you have one of those drag strip parachutes attached to the back of your car

40:27.720 --> 40:31.380
so at least when you land it will be softer.

40:31.380 --> 40:36.000
Or how about don't drive off cliffs, that would be my advice, don't drive off cliffs.

40:36.000 --> 40:38.380
Don't drive anywhere but in Colorado.

40:38.380 --> 40:39.380
What?

40:39.380 --> 40:40.380
Flatland.

40:40.380 --> 40:43.100
Don't talk on your cell phone while driving.

40:43.100 --> 40:46.100
Wait a minute! Colorado has the Rockies!

40:46.100 --> 40:50.100
I'm talking about the flat part. It's kind of hard to drive your car up a mountain.

40:50.100 --> 40:55.100
Anyway, there's cliffs on a mountain. Forget it. Forget it.

40:55.100 --> 40:58.100
The only cliffs I care about are Cliff Notes.

40:58.100 --> 41:02.100
Nintendo is going to be moving into the mobile phone market.

41:02.100 --> 41:06.100
No games just yet. No cell phone Mario. No cell phone Zelda.

41:06.100 --> 41:13.300
Zelda. However, on October 17th, Nintendo Mobile will be providing subscribers with

41:13.300 --> 41:18.480
video game related content such as wallpapers, ringtones, and sound effects from the Super

41:18.480 --> 41:22.380
Mario Brothers series. Oh, one thing I should note, this is in Japan only.

41:22.380 --> 41:27.160
Duh, like I told you that. No, but I actually are going to be porting over the classic games

41:27.160 --> 41:30.240
from what I hear. Some classic games are already available on

41:30.240 --> 41:33.920
Cell Phone. Like, I had Castlevania on my Cell Phone, but it kind of sucked. I mean,

41:33.920 --> 41:36.320
Cell phone games cell phone is not the place to be gaming

41:36.760 --> 41:42.040
It you a couple puzzle games are okay because I like that before crisis game

41:42.040 --> 41:45.120
That was pretty fun on the final fantasy. I just saw crisis

41:45.120 --> 41:51.060
I know I don't I don't think I think even before it was gonna suck only be good if they re-release it to the PSP

41:51.060 --> 41:56.200
I just cell phone is not the place to be gaming because you know at least I'm on my phone most of the games are

41:56.200 --> 42:00.200
Java based and it's slow and just a puzzle game works

42:00.200 --> 42:04.200
okay but not a fast-paced puzzle game like Tetris even sucks. I've seen better games on a

42:04.200 --> 42:08.200
freaking graphing calculator. I've seen better games on the Apple IIe.

42:08.200 --> 42:12.200
Loadrunner, kick! Oregon Trail, yo.

42:12.200 --> 42:16.200
Loki, what's going on in the hack and crack world?

42:16.200 --> 42:20.200
Well, um, the group We Are Back is still teasing the fact

42:20.200 --> 42:24.200
that they're going to be releasing a downgrader. This will downgrade everything from 2.0

42:24.200 --> 42:28.200
on to, um, you know, back to 1. And

42:28.200 --> 42:30.920
That's going to be it right there.

42:30.920 --> 42:36.780
Homebrew is going to be loud for everybody and yeah, so anyways, so that's what's going

42:36.780 --> 42:37.780
on there.

42:37.780 --> 42:41.460
They're also having some homebrew contests for PSP games which is kind of interesting

42:41.460 --> 42:47.540
so they have some entries for that that are actually they're kind of plugging on PSP updates.

42:47.540 --> 42:49.960
Some of them look pretty interesting.

42:49.960 --> 42:54.740
Also a program was released the other day actually that you can change the little intro

42:54.740 --> 43:00.820
video on you have a little small clip that plays when you turn on your PSP or

43:00.820 --> 43:04.380
play game or whatever you can change that and they have a demonstration on

43:04.380 --> 43:08.660
there on how to do that as well so you can customize your PSP a little bit more

43:08.660 --> 43:19.100
and other than that really not too much else going on with the PSP now I should

43:19.100 --> 43:23.220
also say oh one more thing I almost forgot they're actually releasing

43:23.220 --> 43:33.220
another emulator of course coming out and that one was for, oh what was it, I don't remember.

43:33.220 --> 43:39.720
Anyways, enough of that. Let's see, other than that lots of homebrew stuff coming out for the DS

43:39.720 --> 43:45.820
because you know the DS isn't to be forgotten and yeah so just we'll have to wait for the down

43:45.820 --> 43:52.720
grader. They're still saying a couple more weeks and then the shit will hit the fan. Yeah.

43:52.720 --> 44:00.960
All right, moving on, a couple last stories here for tonight's, Civilization 4 is going

44:00.960 --> 44:05.660
to be doing a little pre-order program, a special limited edition collector's package,

44:05.660 --> 44:12.640
which has collector's packaging, a CD soundtrack of the game, a keyboard template, a tech map,

44:12.640 --> 44:17.840
and a spiral bound version of the manual, so that's just a special pre-order edition.

44:17.840 --> 44:20.000
Civilization 4, of course, coming out this October.

44:20.000 --> 44:25.400
I'm interested in it. I love, love, love, love, love, love, love the original Civilization

44:25.400 --> 44:30.200
game. Never really got into Civ 2 or 3. Why? I don't know. I think they just, they got

44:30.200 --> 44:34.800
too complex for me at that point or something or just, I don't know. I liked it simple,

44:34.800 --> 44:39.880
and simple graphics, simple, you know, mechanics to the game and everything, so the first one's

44:39.880 --> 44:45.320
my favorite. But, I am very curious about 4 and I'll definitely give it a try. I'm certainly

44:45.320 --> 44:49.320
to see what they've done with the series since 3.

44:49.320 --> 44:53.320
Mega Man is going to be making an appearance at the

44:53.320 --> 44:57.320
Tokyo Game Show in Capcom's booth. The interesting thing is that the game

44:57.320 --> 45:01.320
is called Rockman Rockman, which would be Mega Man Mega Man.

45:01.320 --> 45:05.320
Which game now? It's called Rockman Rockman.

45:05.320 --> 45:09.320
Yeah, it's a remake of the first Mega Man. Yeah, I was going to get to that.

45:09.320 --> 45:13.320
It happens to be it's going to be a remake of the

45:13.320 --> 45:17.460
original Mega Man game is the rumor about what it's going to be but we

45:17.460 --> 45:21.360
don't know exactly what system it's going to be on but they're saying PSP it

45:21.360 --> 45:26.380
is probably and they actually have the site has launched for it I know that

45:26.380 --> 45:31.540
part yeah the site has launched for it let's see if I can pull it up here to

45:31.540 --> 45:36.720
see what the site was it looks really interesting Mega Man's very it's very

45:36.720 --> 45:41.880
cartoony unlike you know the original Mega Man his head is ginormous which I

45:41.880 --> 45:47.120
don't know why they they did it that way but um it's interesting you can actually

45:47.120 --> 45:51.720
make your own levels on it which is pretty cool

45:51.720 --> 45:55.920
wait you can make your own level yeah has a level editor built into it that's

45:55.920 --> 46:02.520
cool that's very cool it's coming out for the PSP and I can't remember the

46:02.520 --> 46:06.920
website but I will find it out and while we're talking and let you guys know

46:06.920 --> 46:09.560
we're almost at the end of show I only got one more story I'll be hurry I'll

46:09.560 --> 46:15.560
Alright, last story here. We always seem to talk about these video games that are being turned into movies.

46:15.560 --> 46:24.560
MTV, hooray hooray, bought the film rights to Midway's The Suffering.

46:24.560 --> 46:30.560
Of course, The Suffering, the ties that bind is coming out very soon. Another one of them kind of scary games.

46:30.560 --> 46:35.560
Executive Vice President of MTV Films, David Gale, says,

46:35.560 --> 46:39.280
We are very excited to be working hand in hand with Midway to translate this innovative

46:39.280 --> 46:41.880
game into an edge of your seat film.

46:41.880 --> 46:44.840
Gaming is such a huge part of the culture for MTV's audience.

46:44.840 --> 46:49.160
It makes perfect sense for us to work with Midway, Stan Winston, and Circle of Confusion

46:49.160 --> 46:51.360
on bringing The Suffering to life as a feature film.

46:51.360 --> 46:54.600
Yes, that's why I think it's interesting that it says gaming is such a huge part of the

46:54.600 --> 46:59.920
culture for MTV's audience, when I can't think of many gaming shows that MTV has aired.

46:59.920 --> 47:05.000
Maybe a special here and there, but in a category on their video music awards, but not really

47:05.000 --> 47:08.000
huge part of the network. Then again, music videos aren't a huge part of the network either.

47:08.000 --> 47:10.000
I think they're referring to their audience themselves.

47:10.000 --> 47:16.000
I suppose. But, anyway. I guess we'll see when we get some stars and directors attached,

47:16.000 --> 47:20.000
but all we know for now is that MTV is producing them. But that's not necessarily a bad thing.

47:20.000 --> 47:22.000
MTV, you know, even though I'm knocking on them a little bit, they've actually put out

47:22.000 --> 47:26.000
some pretty good films. Um, Election, from a couple years ago, is like one of my favorite

47:26.000 --> 47:29.000
movies. It's great. And MTV was actually behind that, so. Go figure.

47:29.000 --> 47:34.000
And one that I like that's coming out pretty soon, um, was it Role Balance? Looks interesting.

47:34.000 --> 47:36.000
Weren't they behind Napoleon Dynamite too?

47:36.000 --> 47:38.000
I want to say yes.

47:38.000 --> 47:39.000
I think so.

47:39.000 --> 47:41.000
Even though that movie kind of...

47:41.000 --> 47:46.000
I like Napoleon Dynamite and all, but dang, they kind of beat that thing into the ground.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.000
With the shirts and everything.

47:48.000 --> 47:49.000
Yeah.

47:49.000 --> 47:51.000
It was funny. It was really, really funny even, but it wasn't that funny.

47:51.000 --> 47:52.000
Anyway.

47:52.000 --> 47:55.000
Loki, did you find it? Otherwise, it's going to have to wait until next week.

47:55.000 --> 47:56.000
It'll have to wait until next week.

47:56.000 --> 47:58.000
Alright, final thoughts. Dark Sakura.

47:58.000 --> 48:00.000
Reject all psychons.

48:00.000 --> 48:02.000
My final thought is...

48:02.000 --> 48:06.480
I don't know I'm gonna go play Silent Hill 4 because I got my copy back from

48:06.480 --> 48:11.200
Dark Sakura thank you. You're welcome. Loki your final thought. Happy birthday to me. That's

48:11.200 --> 48:16.320
right happy birthday to you. And for your birthday I had Final Fantasy 7 Advent

48:16.320 --> 48:20.120
Children leaked to the internet just for you. Oh yeah I forgot to mention that haha. There you go.

48:20.120 --> 48:25.320
Yeah all right have a good night or day or afternoon whenever you happen to be

48:25.320 --> 48:29.320
listening to this everybody. Have a good time. Just have a good one. Have a good

48:29.320 --> 48:36.560
time have a gay old time Loki wants you to have a gay old time and on that note

48:36.560 --> 48:43.280
goodbye that's the end of another orange lounge radio to-go edition this podcast
