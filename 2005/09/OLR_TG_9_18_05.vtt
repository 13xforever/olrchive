00:18.680 --> 00:25.200
And low everybody once again and welcome to orange lounge radio to go a radio

00:25.520 --> 00:27.520
Dedicated to what gamers really want to know?

00:27.520 --> 00:30.400
Thanks so much for taking a minute to check us out,

00:30.400 --> 00:33.900
downloading our podcast, subscribing, we appreciate it.

00:33.900 --> 00:35.740
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.

00:35.740 --> 00:37.860
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

00:37.860 --> 00:40.020
Over there, say hello to DarkSakura.

00:40.020 --> 00:42.640
Hi, I'm the Giggly Pussy Girl.

00:44.940 --> 00:46.020
How are you?

00:46.020 --> 00:47.500
Full of rage.

00:48.860 --> 00:51.020
If only they knew what a bitch you really were, huh?

00:51.020 --> 00:52.460
Oh, if only.

00:52.460 --> 00:53.300
That's all right.

00:53.300 --> 00:56.860
You know, that little bastard on, what was that site?

00:56.860 --> 00:59.380
Just don't give it this time of day.

00:59.380 --> 01:07.660
But I just have to say that I've probably been gaming since that little newbie wannabe

01:07.660 --> 01:09.260
was in diapers.

01:09.260 --> 01:13.940
I was sitting there with my Pong machine back in the day.

01:13.940 --> 01:17.380
I am more the gamer than you will ever hope to be.

01:17.380 --> 01:18.380
Alright.

01:18.380 --> 01:19.380
But somewhere else?

01:19.380 --> 01:21.900
I had to adjust it and get it out of my system.

01:21.900 --> 01:22.900
Feel better?

01:22.900 --> 01:26.300
Yeah, I actually do feel a lot better, but that's also proof that I'm anything but giggly

01:26.300 --> 01:31.220
and Ditzy, thank you very much. She's a real bitch, ladies and gentlemen. I am, I really am.

01:31.220 --> 01:35.860
Loki, say hello to Techmaster Loki, how you doing? I'm doing good.

01:35.860 --> 01:39.660
Who also is a really big bitch, if you get to know him.

01:39.660 --> 01:42.780
No, forget it. What's on your mind? Loki, how you doing?

01:42.780 --> 01:48.420
Not much. What the hell is this you're looking at? Is this like Deer Hunter on the Xbox 360 or something?

01:48.420 --> 01:51.540
No, that's a screenshot of Elder Scrolls IV.

01:51.540 --> 01:54.540
It looks like a deer hunter game to me with the deer.

01:54.540 --> 01:57.540
It looks like the deer from the deer scene in Ring 2, which sucked.

01:57.540 --> 02:01.540
But you know, they will come out with a deer hunter game, I'm sure, for that.

02:01.540 --> 02:04.540
For the Walmart arcades across America.

02:04.540 --> 02:08.540
You ever notice that every Walmart arcade, quote of what you've ever walked into,

02:08.540 --> 02:11.540
has some type of deer hunting machine, at least around here.

02:11.540 --> 02:14.540
There's always some type of deer hunting machine and a crane.

02:14.540 --> 02:18.540
And amazingly enough, one of the pubs I go to in Old Sac has a deer hunting game.

02:18.540 --> 02:24.900
game amazing really well alright anyway we like to start off the podcast by

02:24.900 --> 02:28.220
talking about what kind of games we've been playing this week dark soccer would

02:28.220 --> 02:30.740
even playing this week I know you've been doing a lot of giggling and having

02:30.740 --> 02:33.740
all those slumber parties and talking about boys but if you actually had any

02:33.740 --> 02:37.980
time to play some games what were you able to find well I don't know out of

02:37.980 --> 02:43.260
the 40-something video game systems that I own yeah have I not been able to find

02:43.260 --> 02:46.900
something to play no serious I've been playing my Nintendo trying to you know

02:46.900 --> 02:49.540
to keep them from running away and pissing on my dinner marks.

02:49.540 --> 02:50.540
That's such a girl game!

02:50.540 --> 02:51.540
You play it too, okay?

02:51.540 --> 02:52.540
Oh yeah, that's right.

02:52.540 --> 02:55.660
And so does Loki over here who owns three copies of it.

02:55.660 --> 02:58.420
I'm thinking of selling two of them.

02:58.420 --> 02:59.420
Give me one.

02:59.420 --> 03:00.420
No!

03:00.420 --> 03:01.420
Puppies!

03:01.420 --> 03:02.420
Alright, so Nintendo.

03:02.420 --> 03:03.420
Yeah, Nintendo.

03:03.420 --> 03:04.420
Puppies!

03:04.420 --> 03:10.140
Um, I've been playing with my puppies and then, um, I got World of Warcraft and installed

03:10.140 --> 03:11.140
it today.

03:11.140 --> 03:12.140
Finally!

03:12.140 --> 03:15.100
Like a year later, one of us gets sucked into World of Warcraft, so...

03:15.100 --> 03:16.100
Not quite sucked in.

03:16.100 --> 03:20.780
sort of pissed off actually really livid that for the lack of controller option

03:20.780 --> 03:25.340
I mean I can play on the keyboard but the controller is so much more efficient

03:25.340 --> 03:31.160
especially since I got used to playing that way on that game that sucks which

03:31.160 --> 03:38.760
is the game I still play thank you very much I hate being forced into being

03:38.760 --> 03:42.000
social with people who are idiots everybody's complained about the game to

03:42.000 --> 03:45.440
which I say why do they call it a massively multiplayer because you're

03:45.440 --> 03:49.440
supposed to play with other people but not necessarily that you play with other

03:49.440 --> 03:53.720
people it's that you interact with other people whatever and at least it's not

03:53.720 --> 03:59.320
like in right right kill please whoop gh k thanks bye fuck you

03:59.320 --> 04:03.720
you know for the people say warp me to here warp me to here I wanted a priest

04:03.720 --> 04:10.720
with only the the gas time warp so that if they say warp me to to the Christmas

04:10.720 --> 04:14.160
place you know five of our audience has probably ever played Ragnarok and

04:14.160 --> 04:18.800
Well, I mean, Ludie, I would be gas times like the haunted place where big, horrible things kill you.

04:18.800 --> 04:19.300
Yeah, okay.

04:19.300 --> 04:22.360
I was level like 70-something and I still couldn't beat everything there.

04:22.660 --> 04:23.160
Yeah.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.240
Um, anyway, um...

04:26.640 --> 04:31.740
I played that... I played actually a few online games. I've been playing something on, uh, gorillas.com.

04:31.740 --> 04:32.240
Mhm.

04:32.400 --> 04:35.340
I've been playing, um, uh, Froggus.

04:36.340 --> 04:36.840
Okay.

04:36.840 --> 04:41.400
Which is... Okay, there's like a little... There's things you can do on the site and collect items and you do certain things.

04:41.400 --> 04:45.800
One of the things is you collect this potion that you'd go up to Noodle's room and insert into Shawn Ryder's head

04:46.760 --> 04:48.920
Okay, and to get the last potion you have to play Frogger

04:49.560 --> 04:55.560
But it's like you go there get the potion and come back. So and it's like horrible silly flash games silly flash games

04:55.560 --> 04:56.560
Yeah, it's kind of fun

04:56.560 --> 04:57.200
um

04:57.200 --> 05:03.520
Dan also picked up like night shade and I go because I got really cheap and he gets a discount in the store and he

05:03.520 --> 05:07.040
Picked up whatever that burnout game is on PSP and has been playing it religiously

05:07.040 --> 05:12.240
Burnout Legends as I'm sure Loki will talk about later. Honestly the more I

05:12.240 --> 05:17.040
hear burnout the more pissed off I get because I was trying to do my fucking

05:17.040 --> 05:21.220
illustrator homework on Saturday night and not Saturday night I'm sorry on

05:21.220 --> 05:26.860
Friday night and he comes in him and his buddy playing burnout as loud as our 50

05:26.860 --> 05:33.320
inch widescreen TV would go and I was PMS and hardcore that night I went out

05:33.320 --> 05:39.680
out there let him have it ate a bunch of chocolate and went to bed all right so

05:39.680 --> 05:42.740
right now that game is on my shit list well I was gonna recommend for World of

05:42.740 --> 05:45.960
Warcraft check out some of the communities out there because I bet you

05:45.960 --> 05:49.240
somebody's got a mod out there you can't be the only one who desires to play

05:49.240 --> 05:52.200
controllers got to be something going on out there so check it out you can mod

05:52.200 --> 05:58.720
pretty much everything in World of Warcraft using Lua I like all the

05:58.720 --> 06:02.220
interfaces like someone actually created an auction interface there where you can

06:02.220 --> 06:06.540
actually it will tell you what the item that you're trying to sell is going for

06:06.540 --> 06:10.820
what the previous history is and what they think that you can get for it and

06:10.820 --> 06:14.540
that type of stuff that's pretty cool sounds cool all right Loki what do you

06:14.540 --> 06:20.140
been playing this week I've been playing burnout revenge and that game is it's

06:20.140 --> 06:23.820
awesome you know the first thing we did started playing traffic attack because

06:23.820 --> 06:27.980
there's nothing like you know driving 209 miles an hour it's smashing into

06:27.980 --> 06:34.980
every single car in the world on this freaking track and just having them fly over you like

06:34.980 --> 06:40.900
a wake of water. It's just, it's great. It's the most fun ever. And the take down mode

06:40.900 --> 06:44.820
when you're playing that you can actually use the crash breaker which makes your car

06:44.820 --> 06:51.140
explode. So that's really fun as well. The only complaint I have about it is the new

06:51.140 --> 06:55.780
way that they're doing the crash mode. They have this kind of, it's almost like golf games

06:55.780 --> 07:02.300
where you have a little meter on the side and you have to hit your button once to stop

07:02.300 --> 07:06.320
the meter and then hit it again before it goes too low.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.980
And basically how accurately you hit that is how fast you go.

07:10.980 --> 07:13.820
And it's really strange how they've done that.

07:13.820 --> 07:19.380
And I didn't quite get it at first so I made my car explode or stall and stuff like that.

07:19.380 --> 07:21.860
But other than that it's pretty cool.

07:21.860 --> 07:26.360
I just can't wait to unlock more cars because it's been pretty tough to do that.

07:26.360 --> 07:30.060
Then Burnout Legends, I've been playing that for the PSP, and that game is fun.

07:30.060 --> 07:33.460
The only thing that sucks about that game is you actually, that game forces you to play with

07:33.460 --> 07:34.340
other people

07:34.340 --> 07:37.500
because in order to unlock all the cars there's

07:37.500 --> 07:39.600
six cars that are

07:39.600 --> 07:44.140
for each game and you have to actually go to play other people with those cars

07:44.140 --> 07:44.500
and

07:44.500 --> 07:48.180
it's almost like Nintendogs is what they're doing with it.

07:48.180 --> 07:51.780
So that's pretty much it. Just racing games. Just Burnout Burnout Burnout all week long.

07:51.780 --> 07:57.500
Yeah, I'm going to try to pick, or I have Urban Reign, I should try to play that.

07:57.500 --> 08:01.260
It's kind of a fighting game, but beat-em-up game at the same time.

08:01.260 --> 08:02.260
It's like Tekken.

08:02.260 --> 08:09.500
It actually has Paul Phoenix and Law in it from the Tekken series, which, had I known

08:09.500 --> 08:16.420
that when I was selling it, I probably would have sold it a bit better, but oh well.

08:16.420 --> 08:19.900
Alright, let's see, what have I been playing this week?

08:19.900 --> 08:26.900
I had a seven hour marathon of Final Fantasy XI this weekend. Never again will I play an MMO for that long.

08:26.900 --> 08:30.900
But it was one of those things where it was like, there was a mission, and we all wanted to get it done,

08:30.900 --> 08:35.900
and on top of that I'd already been leveling. It was like, I really had a lazy Saturday in every essence of the word.

08:35.900 --> 08:42.900
And so, I'm sure some MMO addicts out there are cheering me on right now, but my god, that was just too much MMO for me on Saturday.

08:42.900 --> 08:48.900
I haven't played Final Fantasy XI for a long time. I'm actually thinking, I have enough PTO where I can take a couple days off, I think, to actually play Final Fantasy.

08:48.900 --> 09:00.900
What else did I play? I got to check out a couple new games. I actually went out and bought a copy of Mortal Kombat Shallon Monks, which is one of the games I played at E3.

09:00.900 --> 09:07.900
It was one of those pleasant surprise games for me where I wasn't really expecting a whole lot out of the title, but I actually had a lot of fun with it at E3.

09:07.900 --> 09:14.900
So I thought, okay, I'm going to check this out. I'm going to buy it for the console. So I decided to buy it for Xbox for no real reason than I wanted Xbox games.

09:14.900 --> 09:20.940
Oh, yeah, now that I have HDTV the fact that Xbox kind of supports HD a little bit better than the other systems

09:20.940 --> 09:23.600
I think kind of sells me on more Xbox games

09:23.600 --> 09:29.620
Although Mortal Kombat doesn't really support widescreen or any of that, but whatever it's still really pretty looking the graphics in the game

09:30.260 --> 09:36.340
Very colorful very nice looking a very similar graphical style to the previous Mortal Kombat game

09:36.900 --> 09:42.660
Not deadly alliance, but what was the one in between I can't remember the name of it now Mortal Kombat deception

09:42.660 --> 09:44.660
Thank you, Deception was the one that just recently out.

09:44.660 --> 09:46.660
See, if I weren't a real gamer, I wouldn't know that.

09:46.660 --> 09:48.660
We get it, we get it, honey.

09:48.660 --> 09:50.660
Alright, um, we get it.

09:50.660 --> 09:52.660
Anyway, um,

09:52.660 --> 09:54.660
you remember that

09:54.660 --> 09:56.660
Mortal Kombat Deception had that conquest

09:56.660 --> 09:58.660
mode in it. It's kind of like they decided to take

09:58.660 --> 10:00.660
conquest and kind of go, let's try

10:00.660 --> 10:02.660
and make a game out of it. But it's, the game

10:02.660 --> 10:04.660
itself isn't playing like the

10:04.660 --> 10:06.660
conquest mode. It's more like, honestly, this is the

10:06.660 --> 10:08.660
best thing I could describe it. It felt to me like

10:08.660 --> 10:10.660
I was playing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the arcade

10:10.660 --> 10:12.660
game, but with Mortal Kombat characters.

10:12.660 --> 10:18.020
You remember when they tried to do that side-scrolling RPG-type game with Sub-Zero and X?

10:18.020 --> 10:19.020
It was awful.

10:19.020 --> 10:20.460
The mythology games were awful.

10:20.460 --> 10:23.620
No, but this one is surprisingly pretty fun.

10:23.620 --> 10:24.700
It's really good.

10:24.700 --> 10:25.700
It's pretty action-based.

10:25.700 --> 10:31.820
Honestly, the best comparison I can think of is the Ninja Turtles arcade game, except

10:31.820 --> 10:35.140
it's Mortal Kombat characters, and you're just beating people up left and right, and

10:35.140 --> 10:39.060
you can do all these fancy combos, and as you gain experience, you can purchase new

10:39.060 --> 10:44.620
combos and new things. So it's actually a lot of fun. My only minor complaints with

10:44.620 --> 10:51.460
Shaolin Monks is that there's just some real basic gameplay mechanic things that don't

10:51.460 --> 10:55.900
work for me, such as the fatalities. I think the fatalities are kind of fun and it's kind

10:55.900 --> 11:00.400
of cute they put them in there, but unfortunately you only get one fatality in the beginning

11:00.400 --> 11:04.200
and I don't know if I'm doing something wrong, but I've been playing the game for a couple

11:04.200 --> 11:08.600
hours now and I just got like a new fatality called a multi ality or

11:08.600 --> 11:09.280
something like that

11:09.280 --> 11:12.280
well they're supposed to be looking in the list a blank fatalities like 20

11:12.280 --> 11:13.160
different things you can do

11:13.160 --> 11:17.000
I guess I haven't found any yet maybe I'm supposed to find them myself I don't

11:17.000 --> 11:17.400
know

11:17.400 --> 11:21.100
but I get kinda bored with a fatality theme is like I'm doing the same thing

11:21.100 --> 11:21.600
over and over

11:21.600 --> 11:25.440
slice slice slice you know with the hat is playing as Kung Lao right now so I'm

11:25.440 --> 11:26.800
doing the hat slice and half

11:26.800 --> 11:30.600
and it's cute at first and really funny and you know graphically well done

11:30.600 --> 11:35.340
but it gets old. I think if the fatality combo meter filled maybe like half as

11:35.340 --> 11:35.900
fast

11:35.900 --> 11:39.780
see the fatality thing you only did half as often, I think it would have been better. It seems

11:39.780 --> 11:41.780
like the fatality thing is really repetitive

11:41.780 --> 11:44.740
but you gain an awful lot of experience from doing it so you feel like you have to do it all

11:44.740 --> 11:45.300
the time.

11:45.300 --> 11:49.860
The other thing that kind of irked me is that you can get caught going in loops

11:49.860 --> 11:52.380
if you don't really understand where you're going or what you're doing. Like

11:52.380 --> 11:55.580
the enemies always seem to regenerate in these certain places

11:55.580 --> 11:59.100
and while that can be really good for gaining a lot of experience really fast

11:59.100 --> 12:03.140
it kinda makes you feel like you're not doing anything and so I kinda wish that

12:03.140 --> 12:06.060
at some point the enemies went away and left you alone for a little while so you

12:06.060 --> 12:07.780
can kind of figure out okay where do I go next

12:07.780 --> 12:10.860
and then new enemies come out so I kinda got a little monotonous there

12:10.860 --> 12:14.580
and then my only other complaint would be the lack of save points

12:14.580 --> 12:18.740
I can literally go 45 minutes in the game and not find a single save point

12:18.740 --> 12:22.340
so there really needed to be about twice as many save points as there are so that

12:22.340 --> 12:23.360
was a little bit frustrating

12:23.360 --> 12:26.940
otherwise though those are just you know really in the grand scope of things some

12:26.940 --> 12:30.300
minor complaints I think the game is a heck of a lot of fun if you're if you're

12:30.300 --> 12:34.220
a fan of Mortal Kombat in any way you're gonna like this game because it really

12:34.220 --> 12:38.420
gets into the story better so than any of the movies ever did it really gets

12:38.420 --> 12:43.020
into the story and it does a great job I mean movies there was only one movie

12:43.020 --> 12:47.540
there was two I know you're denying the existence of it but believe it or not

12:47.540 --> 12:53.420
there was a second movie I want back it was so good that they actually made a

12:53.420 --> 12:58.720
TV series too that's that's right huh oh god anyway um just to put in

12:58.720 --> 13:02.960
perspective just how cool this game can be sometimes like I was playing this one

13:02.960 --> 13:07.280
level the last level I was on I was fighting katana jade and Molina all at

13:07.280 --> 13:11.420
once like this level and suddenly katana I don't want to spoil the story but

13:11.420 --> 13:14.420
something happens where katana is taken out of the picture basically and then

13:14.420 --> 13:17.680
it's just jade and Molina and you can like throw them into these traps and

13:17.680 --> 13:22.180
then hit this switch and it goes into the test your might mode from like

13:22.180 --> 13:25.660
Mortal Kombat 1 where you have to really slam all the buttons, they kind of overdo that

13:25.660 --> 13:28.800
a little bit in the game, but it's still really cute that they brought back Test Your Might.

13:28.800 --> 13:32.120
And like, if you do the Test Your Might thing, then you'll like set a fire trap so you can

13:32.120 --> 13:35.760
set Mileena on fire a little bit. Just cute little things like that, I can't believe I

13:35.760 --> 13:38.160
called it cute, but seriously, like little things like that-

13:38.160 --> 13:43.240
Mortal Kombat's so cute! It's not cute anymore, there's no Babalities!

13:43.240 --> 13:47.920
Anyway, or Animalities. Babalities. Friendship!

13:47.920 --> 13:51.880
So Mortal Kombat, I recommend it to fans of the Mortal Kombat series, and just if you

13:51.880 --> 13:55.420
like those action fighting style games, you'll probably get a kick out of this, but if it

13:55.420 --> 13:57.640
doesn't sound like your kind of game, you're probably not going to like it.

13:57.640 --> 14:01.800
You know what else, because that did get released earlier, it was scheduled originally for the

14:01.800 --> 14:06.180
21st, they've got another fighting game coming out that looks pretty good, and I actually

14:06.180 --> 14:10.220
played a demo of it, Marvel Nemesis, Rise of the Imperfects, which is a Marvel game

14:10.220 --> 14:14.860
they actually kind of, it's sort of like an arena fighting game type of thing, but they

14:14.860 --> 14:19.300
They added their own characters with their background stories too, which were really

14:19.300 --> 14:20.300
cool from my side.

14:20.300 --> 14:24.280
It kind of reminded me of Twisted Mel Black a bit, the way they did the stories.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.500
But really fun.

14:26.500 --> 14:29.380
Really quick, the other game I played this week I want to give a real quick review to.

14:29.380 --> 14:32.900
I actually got to play We Heart Katamari, because as you might have heard on last week's

14:32.900 --> 14:37.660
show, Target, some of the Target stores acquired copies of the game and sold them early because

14:37.660 --> 14:41.300
the game's not actually out until this week, so We Heart Katamari is going to be on shelves

14:41.300 --> 14:42.300
this week.

14:42.300 --> 14:44.100
I did get a chance to play it via one of my friends.

14:44.100 --> 14:49.160
I only got to play like the first two levels, but I'm telling you what kids if you liked the first Katamari Dimash

14:49.160 --> 14:54.120
He ain't gonna be disappointed. The movies are just as quirky as they were the first time

14:54.120 --> 14:57.160
It's kind of like the first game was so successful

14:57.160 --> 15:02.860
they gave them a bigger budget to go through with this second game and you really see that they've kind of put more into this

15:02.860 --> 15:07.680
Game and just you know, it's it's more the same but at the same time

15:08.280 --> 15:10.880
It just works. I don't know how else to explain

15:10.880 --> 15:13.320
It just works if you were a fan of the first game. You're like this game

15:13.320 --> 15:16.160
If you weren't a fan of the first game, I don't think there's anything new here

15:16.160 --> 15:19.260
That's gonna win you over. But if you haven't played the Katamari Damacy game

15:19.880 --> 15:22.800
Check this out. It's it's just such a quirky little title

15:22.800 --> 15:29.160
I I think I think you guys get a kick out of it and the music the music not quite as solid as the first

15:29.160 --> 15:30.960
Game, but the music is a lot of fun, too

15:30.960 --> 15:35.460
And that the script is the writing is just as hilarious as it was in the first game. It's great

15:36.780 --> 15:38.780
Katamari fans won't be disappointed

15:38.780 --> 15:42.060
Alright, let's get into some news for tonight.

15:42.060 --> 15:46.460
Starting it off with a little bit of Tokyo Game Show news, and of course, how could we

15:46.460 --> 15:47.460
not mention this?

15:47.460 --> 15:51.300
This has been everybody's gamer blog out there on the internet said something about this.

15:51.300 --> 15:54.980
I'm sure all the other gaming podcasts you guys subscribed to probably talked about this

15:54.980 --> 15:55.980
at some point.

15:55.980 --> 15:56.980
We have to say something about it.

15:56.980 --> 15:59.940
Nintendo Revolution, the controller.

15:59.940 --> 16:00.940
What is this?

16:00.940 --> 16:05.060
The Nintendo nunchucks or something, where you've got the one little piece with the analog

16:05.060 --> 16:06.560
stick and then a remote control.

16:06.560 --> 16:07.560
What's up with this?

16:07.560 --> 16:08.560
What do you guys think of this?

16:08.560 --> 16:10.400
pictures out on our website, oranceandrea.com.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.960
Even though this technically goes into another segment,

16:12.960 --> 16:16.040
actually one of our listeners emailed us, Britney,

16:16.040 --> 16:18.640
who basically agreed with me.

16:18.640 --> 16:22.800
It's like using a big freakin' remote control.

16:22.800 --> 16:24.620
Now Nintendo says, and I think part of the reason

16:24.620 --> 16:26.880
that they're doing this is that they wanna kinda lure in

16:26.880 --> 16:30.120
people that are a little scared of,

16:30.120 --> 16:32.000
when they see a gaming controller, they think,

16:32.000 --> 16:35.080
ah, it's a gaming thing, and I'm not really hip on this.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.600
So by making a remote control device,

16:37.600 --> 16:43.720
uses a remote control they tried this before sort of with a system called the

16:43.720 --> 16:48.860
fairchild channel okay with a little tiny little controller at the top and a

16:48.860 --> 16:52.060
little hold stick that you hold it's a little different but that controller

16:52.060 --> 16:55.420
sucked the whole system sucked honestly so do you think the revolution is gonna

16:55.420 --> 16:59.300
suck this controller well you know the one thing that I say about about a

16:59.300 --> 17:04.860
system a system is only as good as the games that are on it I agree but part of

17:04.860 --> 17:12.020
The game is how it's controlled. That's major part of the gameplay right? There's how you're controlling it. This thing looks uncomfortable

17:12.660 --> 17:13.940
Mm-hmm

17:13.940 --> 17:18.780
Lately my whole big thing has been ergonomics and like I said on our three-hour show

17:19.500 --> 17:21.180
this one

17:21.180 --> 17:25.140
Looks highly uncomfortable. It's you're gonna be holding your wrist

17:25.980 --> 17:31.560
Okay, take your hand hold it straight up turn your wrist sideways and do like you're holding a remote control now

17:31.560 --> 17:38.080
Now imagine holding your hand in this position for an hour, two hours, however long you plan

17:38.080 --> 17:39.600
on playing a game.

17:39.600 --> 17:44.140
Now do you think that that's a natural position for your hand to be in?

17:44.140 --> 17:45.880
Imagine the stress you're putting your joints under.

17:45.880 --> 17:51.680
Now imagine if you are an older gamer, you work at, say, a desk job on a computer.

17:51.680 --> 17:53.960
You're already putting your arm through stress that way.

17:53.960 --> 17:56.320
Imagine the stress you're putting it through with this system that's supposed to help you

17:56.320 --> 17:58.200
relax, have some fun.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.560
You're going to be hurting.

18:00.560 --> 18:04.480
I think it's gonna cause, you know, true medical issues.

18:04.480 --> 18:05.840
Do you think, though, that this will come out

18:05.840 --> 18:07.200
in the testing process?

18:07.200 --> 18:08.440
For instance, something I had brought up

18:08.440 --> 18:10.400
on our three-hour program, we were talking about this,

18:10.400 --> 18:11.640
the three-hour show, Sunday nights,

18:11.640 --> 18:14.320
on orangehonserator.com, we were talking about

18:14.320 --> 18:15.800
this controller issue a little bit,

18:15.800 --> 18:18.480
and I mentioned that the DS at E3,

18:18.480 --> 18:19.800
the year that the DS came out,

18:19.800 --> 18:22.720
it changed from E3 to when it actually came out,

18:22.720 --> 18:25.060
and you said it's a little more comfortable

18:25.060 --> 18:26.120
than it was at E3.

18:26.120 --> 18:28.200
So do you think that maybe after they test this a little bit,

18:28.200 --> 18:29.800
if they find these type of ergonomic issues

18:29.800 --> 18:34.080
their testers they might change this a little bit make it I don't know how they

18:34.080 --> 18:37.400
can drastically without making drastic changes the controller make it a little

18:37.400 --> 18:41.160
more ergonomic but maybe just the way the games play one would hope so one

18:41.160 --> 18:44.080
would really hope so so we'll see but don't knock it till you tried it right

18:44.080 --> 18:47.800
yeah absolutely I mean I'll give it a fair go but honestly I'll get that

18:47.800 --> 18:52.440
little wave bird looking thingy you know something what was that Loki you posted

18:52.440 --> 18:55.620
like a mock-up on our website was this a real-deal picture or a mock-up a lot of

18:55.620 --> 18:59.020
our feedback is a mock-up of a Wavebird controller.

18:59.020 --> 19:04.980
It's something that was the president of Nintendo's development or something like that. They're

19:04.980 --> 19:08.420
talking about how they're going to be adding that. It's just they're going to have a ton

19:08.420 --> 19:13.980
of attachments, which means more stuff you've got to buy, but I'm not saying that the other

19:13.980 --> 19:19.500
systems aren't doing that either, Microsoft, and it looks good. I think it'll work really

19:19.500 --> 19:23.660
well actually. I don't think it's going to be a problem at all. I mean, you hold controllers

19:23.660 --> 19:29.020
in your hand I don't see you know it's just like it's just like a remote

19:29.020 --> 19:33.800
positioning I think I think if it's light enough it's not gonna be a problem

19:33.800 --> 19:37.640
the thing I find remote controls uncomfortable the thing I like about it

19:37.640 --> 19:41.060
though is that you can take that remote control turn it 90 degrees and you've

19:41.060 --> 19:44.420
basically got an old style NES controller and that would be cool yep

19:44.420 --> 19:48.580
so that would be more comfortable but I'm thinking though the intended way

19:48.580 --> 19:53.980
like a remote control and I know this from experience because I played space

19:53.980 --> 19:57.540
ace on my DVD player right and I hurt by the time I was done

19:57.540 --> 20:02.340
I know how this is going to feel and it's not it's not natural but maybe do

20:02.340 --> 20:04.980
you think maybe we're being misled by these pictures a little bit that are

20:04.980 --> 20:07.740
showing it like maybe this won't be the way it actually plays because I can't

20:07.740 --> 20:11.940
see how with your thumb you'd be able to hit that control pad and have you guys

20:11.940 --> 20:15.380
seen the video of this I I didn't have time to download have you guys seen the

20:15.380 --> 20:16.660
from Tokyo Game Show?

20:16.660 --> 20:17.700
Well, describe it for us.

20:17.700 --> 20:20.140
Well, for example, the way that it was shown,

20:20.140 --> 20:22.060
this is the video they showed everybody

20:22.060 --> 20:24.340
when they were unveiling it, is it actually

20:24.340 --> 20:28.900
looks like it's from the view that you're in the TV.

20:28.900 --> 20:32.180
And basically, you're using that as you're not

20:32.180 --> 20:33.780
using the buttons on the controller.

20:33.780 --> 20:36.660
The controller itself, because it acts like a 3D mouse,

20:36.660 --> 20:37.940
is what you're using.

20:37.940 --> 20:41.180
So for example, some of the things that they're showing,

20:41.180 --> 20:44.820
you could say this might be the next WarioWare game.

20:44.820 --> 20:51.020
a guy was chopping using the controller, acting like a knife, and frying stuff like a knife.

20:51.020 --> 20:55.720
I had heard now, I had read that there was a video out there of the Metroid Prime 2 echoes

20:55.720 --> 20:59.980
being kind of played on this setup where they said moving around using the Bluetooth or

20:59.980 --> 21:02.220
whatever it is that's in there that senses where you are in the room.

21:02.220 --> 21:06.480
Well, the way it works is there's two sensors you put on your TV and it basically figures

21:06.480 --> 21:10.820
out, it triangulates where your controller is going to be, kind of similar to the power

21:10.820 --> 21:12.140
glove that came out.

21:12.140 --> 21:17.820
Now the other things that they showed with this is playing tennis you know like you would

21:17.820 --> 21:25.460
be just like racket fishing also you know like sword fighting stuff like that another

21:25.460 --> 21:29.420
thing which could be like in the next Luigi's mansion using it as a flashlight something

21:29.420 --> 21:35.220
like that but then for like first person shooter games they're saying like okay with the analog

21:35.220 --> 21:42.000
or the nunchuck add on there you use the analog to move around and basically the other controller

21:42.000 --> 21:46.280
the remote would be the gun. You would point at what you want to fire at and pull the trigger

21:46.280 --> 21:49.560
button underneath and there you go, you're shooting something. Or you want to switch

21:49.560 --> 21:53.600
your weapon, you know, hit the button on top there. Plus the analog has two buttons on

21:53.600 --> 21:59.560
it as well. Two trigger buttons. So I think it's going to work because really there's

21:59.560 --> 22:04.480
no way it can't work because if something, if you know, a game calls for something else,

22:04.480 --> 22:08.900
they'll build another add-on for it. They always do. So alright. Well it'll be interesting

22:08.900 --> 22:11.960
to see what happens. I'm sure we'll see more and more of this leading up to next year's

22:11.960 --> 22:14.360
E3, which I'm sure will be a big, big unveil.

22:14.360 --> 22:16.080
And here's the other thing, too.

22:16.080 --> 22:16.800
Third party.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.680
I mean, third party's going to be developing controllers.

22:18.680 --> 22:19.560
You don't like this one?

22:19.560 --> 22:20.640
Buy a third party controller.

22:20.640 --> 22:22.040
It's going to look different anyways.

22:22.040 --> 22:23.640
It'll be something you probably want.

22:23.640 --> 22:24.600
All right, we'll see.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.400
All right, if you guys have additional feedback,

22:26.400 --> 22:28.740
you can always visit our forums, orangelaungeradio.com.

22:28.740 --> 22:30.080
There's definitely a thread about this.

22:30.080 --> 22:31.040
They're talking about that.

22:31.040 --> 22:33.240
It's also our poll going on right now on the main page

22:33.240 --> 22:35.000
of orangelaungeradio.com.

22:35.000 --> 22:35.560
Check that out.

22:35.560 --> 22:36.040
Answer it.

22:36.040 --> 22:38.360
What do you think of the Nintendo Revolution controller?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.640
Now the real question is, what color Nintendo Revolution

22:40.640 --> 22:41.760
are you going to buy?

22:41.760 --> 22:44.680
the green one, because they have the green, red,

22:44.680 --> 22:48.660
the gray, the chrome, white, and black.

22:48.660 --> 22:50.320
We're gonna have the red.

22:50.320 --> 22:52.220
All right, also on our main page,

22:52.220 --> 22:54.680
we definitely want to take a minute to recognize this.

22:54.680 --> 22:59.320
There is a banner right there for a fundraiser effort

22:59.320 --> 23:00.960
we're doing for Hurricane Katrina relief.

23:00.960 --> 23:02.440
And it's not just us, we're doing it together

23:02.440 --> 23:04.560
with some other companies in Sacramento,

23:04.560 --> 23:08.040
Dark Records and Club 21 slash Rapture.

23:08.040 --> 23:10.360
And it's a fundraiser for Hurricane Katrina.

23:10.360 --> 23:18.900
Not just money, but what we're looking for is donations as well, food items for animals

23:18.900 --> 23:23.900
is a big thing that we're looking for because we're trying to also raise money and general

23:23.900 --> 23:26.540
awareness to the animal victims of Hurricane Katrina.

23:26.540 --> 23:29.860
So check out the website for more details.

23:29.860 --> 23:33.320
If you're in the Sacramento area where our show is based, there's a lot you can do to

23:33.320 --> 23:38.500
help out with this because you can actually donate at Club 21 on Thursday nights.

23:38.500 --> 23:43.000
Even if you're anywhere in the world, we are taking financial donations, and if you'd like

23:43.000 --> 23:50.260
it to be specifically forwarded to the SPCA for pet relief, note that, and we'll collect

23:50.260 --> 23:53.740
all that money together and send it on behalf of Orange Launch Radio.

23:53.740 --> 23:56.940
So check that out.

23:56.940 --> 24:02.220
We did mention, though, that we are working with Dark Records and Club 21.

24:02.220 --> 24:06.460
Alright, moving on into some gaming news tonight.

24:06.460 --> 24:12.980
a lot of news coming from, uh, the Tokyo Game Show. Metal Gear Solid 4, Guns of the Patriots

24:12.980 --> 24:18.720
is the title, 8 minute long preview for this game. Did you check it out, Logan? I checked

24:18.720 --> 24:23.300
it out. What'd you think? It's interesting, Snake is quite old. Yeah, so it's gonna be

24:23.300 --> 24:26.660
like a future thing now. Yeah. No, you know what I thought was the coolest thing was the

24:26.660 --> 24:30.820
little mini Metal Gear with Otakon on it that they took right out of Policenauts. That was

24:30.820 --> 24:35.840
freakin' cool. Pretty cool. So, uh, that's definitely something to look forward to. I'm

24:35.840 --> 24:38.200
I'm sure a lot of fans are looking forward to the Metal Gear.

24:38.200 --> 24:43.520
I was reading too, a lot of people were thinking, oh, it's pre-rendered, you know, it's crap.

24:43.520 --> 24:49.560
They were saying, though, that they actually, what was it, Kojima, they showed that the

24:49.560 --> 24:56.720
actual presentation was actually being rendered real-time, and they stopped it and panned

24:56.720 --> 25:03.400
of round snake as well to you know kind of stop those disbelievers from posting

25:03.400 --> 25:09.560
crap about so interesting looks good speaking of Kojima he basically said

25:09.560 --> 25:14.600
that Metal Gear 4 will be I'm sorry Metal Gear Solid 4 will be his last but

25:14.600 --> 25:18.240
I kind of think didn't he say the same thing after Metal Gear Solid 3 he was

25:18.240 --> 25:22.040
gonna do another one we have Hulk Hogan syndrome here the man keeps saying he's

25:22.040 --> 25:28.240
gonna retire but he always shows up at WrestleMania well he also now now Kojima

25:28.240 --> 25:33.440
also says that yoji shinkawa who's the art director will be leaving with him so

25:33.440 --> 25:35.840
he's not just saying I'm leaving saying that the art director is going with him

25:35.840 --> 25:42.920
so should be interesting if this really happens but remember this if Kojima did

25:42.920 --> 25:46.320
leave it wouldn't be the first Metal Gear Solid or game that they would do

25:46.320 --> 25:50.360
without him because you might remember snakes revenge on the NES which also by

25:50.360 --> 25:53.480
the way was kind of a bad yeah but that wasn't really Metal Gear I don't even

25:53.480 --> 25:59.000
think he acknowledges it because there was actually a Metal Gear 2 on the MSX

25:59.000 --> 26:03.480
in Japan his direct quote was I decided to make the real sequel to Metal Gear

26:03.480 --> 26:10.900
when he saw set snakes revenge oh yeah all right also coming out of Tokyo game

26:10.900 --> 26:14.480
show those who music game fans are gonna be very pleased to hear that Konami

26:14.480 --> 26:18.000
after a long hiatus is gonna be putting out brand new guitar freaks and drum

26:18.000 --> 26:21.960
Mania games. That's right, Gittadora, as the series is sometimes referred to as

26:21.960 --> 26:27.080
getting the V games released. Don't know quite yet if it's a combo game, but

26:27.080 --> 26:30.960
since we know that all the previous PlayStation 2 releases, which ended at

26:30.960 --> 26:37.240
Guitar Freaks fourth mix and Drum Mania third mix, were combined together. To put

26:37.240 --> 26:41.160
this into some perspective for you guys, Guitar Freaks V, I think is what the

26:41.160 --> 26:46.660
11th or 12th? I lost count. I think it's like the 12th of Guitar Freaks in the

26:46.660 --> 26:51.600
arcade and the last one we got on ps2 is 4 so there's a whole lot of ground to

26:51.600 --> 26:56.100
cover here with these new games that are coming out on the ps2 gonna come out in

26:56.100 --> 27:01.820
2006 in Japan no word yet if the series will finally make a crossover into

27:01.820 --> 27:06.700
America but I think what might make or break that would be Konami if they

27:06.700 --> 27:10.980
watch the success of guitar hero which is what red octane and harmonics are

27:10.980 --> 27:13.620
gonna be putting out pretty soon I believe before the end of the year so

27:13.620 --> 27:14.620
So it'll be interesting to see.

27:14.620 --> 27:19.140
If that does very well, then Konami might try to take back the market that they kind

27:19.140 --> 27:20.140
of created overseas.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.140
It's kind of weird.

27:21.140 --> 27:22.140
Oh, don't worry.

27:22.140 --> 27:23.220
Interesting way it works out there.

27:23.220 --> 27:24.740
They'll take notice.

27:24.740 --> 27:25.740
Alright.

27:25.740 --> 27:30.260
Also, I wanted to point out some Final Fantasy news from Tokyo Game Show.

27:30.260 --> 27:33.540
Final Fantasy XI will definitely be expanding.

27:33.540 --> 27:39.600
Treasures of At-Organ was announced officially, the new expansion pack, to be released with

27:39.600 --> 27:43.560
the Xbox 360, assumably, version of Final Fantasy XI.

27:43.560 --> 27:47.680
Some early preview videos are hinting that Blue Mage will be one of the new

27:47.680 --> 27:50.000
classes because in the video you could see

27:50.000 --> 27:53.040
this is one of the videos I did download, of course, you can actually see

27:53.040 --> 27:56.080
I think it was a human was breathing fire in one of the videos and like

27:56.080 --> 27:58.700
Ataru was shooting spider web using one of the spider's attacks.

27:58.700 --> 28:01.920
Pretty neat looking artifact armor for Blue Mage too.

28:01.920 --> 28:05.920
Also there's another mystery kind of job class, not quite sure what it is, but it looks

28:05.920 --> 28:07.480
like there's another job class in there too.

28:07.480 --> 28:09.880
All you have to do is look to Tactics for your ideas.

28:09.880 --> 28:11.880
Yep, look to Tactics for ideas.

28:11.880 --> 28:16.680
I should have said... I would have... I thought that Alchemist or Geomancer would be for sure,

28:16.680 --> 28:20.280
because I especially thought Geomancer with all the elemental focus and stuff,

28:20.280 --> 28:22.080
but it doesn't look like that's the new class.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.480
World of Warcraft has that.

28:23.480 --> 28:24.780
I know, but...

28:24.780 --> 28:26.480
Blue Mage would be cool.

28:26.480 --> 28:29.480
But, you know, there's gonna... yeah, everybody's gonna be a Blue Mage.

28:29.480 --> 28:30.480
Alright.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.480
So, we will see.

28:32.480 --> 28:35.180
We don't have any details as to when these games are coming out,

28:35.180 --> 28:38.900
but we're thinking, I'm thinking anyway, probably early 2006.

28:38.900 --> 28:41.700
I would say it would be a good guesstimate.

28:41.700 --> 28:43.460
Also, Final Fantasy related.

28:43.460 --> 28:45.380
Now, Jamie, this has to be a Final Fantasy game

28:45.380 --> 28:48.060
that you like, because if not, you're just not human.

28:48.060 --> 28:50.880
Final Fantasy IV will be coming out for the,

28:50.880 --> 28:53.540
now you smiled there, you like Final Fantasy IV, right?

28:53.540 --> 28:55.540
Yeah, the five was better, but I do like four.

28:55.540 --> 28:59.260
Final Fantasy IV is coming out for the Game Boy Advance.

28:59.260 --> 29:01.120
So still some life there in the Game Boy Advance,

29:01.120 --> 29:02.500
it's not all DS right now.

29:02.500 --> 29:07.220
Final Fantasy IV is being ported to the Game Boy Advance in Japan on December 12th.

29:07.540 --> 29:12.060
Um, it will include new areas and get this, new characters.

29:12.060 --> 29:12.940
Uh-oh!

29:12.940 --> 29:16.860
Should be interesting. My gut reaction tells me, oh my gosh, Palom and Porum.

29:16.860 --> 29:19.460
Finally will be able to be unstoned and rejoin your party.

29:19.740 --> 29:20.700
That would be cool.

29:20.700 --> 29:25.220
I think that would be like the perfect, like the biggest fan-pleaser that Square could do.

29:25.220 --> 29:28.340
I know it's cheesy, but what a fan-pleaser.

29:28.340 --> 29:30.340
More spoonie Bartness!

29:30.340 --> 29:31.740
Yay!

29:31.740 --> 29:33.540
So that should be cool.

29:33.540 --> 29:35.900
No word yet if it's coming out in America,

29:35.900 --> 29:38.540
but Final Fantasy's pretty big here now,

29:38.540 --> 29:41.020
and they put out all the other compilations,

29:41.020 --> 29:41.860
one and two.

29:41.860 --> 29:42.680
They can keep putting out, we'll keep taking it.

29:42.680 --> 29:43.960
They'll do, we'll keep buying it.

29:43.960 --> 29:46.180
Come on, the micro's coming out soon.

29:46.180 --> 29:47.540
We'll buy it.

29:47.540 --> 29:49.660
All right, let's get to tonight's mailbag.

29:49.660 --> 29:51.980
Dark Sakura, got some letters for us?

29:51.980 --> 29:53.660
I do indeedy.

29:53.660 --> 29:55.700
All right, if you have letters,

29:55.700 --> 29:59.400
send it to our mailbag, togo, T-O-G-O,

29:59.400 --> 30:00.620
at orangelaundryradio.com.

30:00.620 --> 30:05.580
We love getting your feedback dark Sakura who wrote us today Sasuke sent us an email a question

30:05.580 --> 30:08.460
We've been asked many many times actually just very recently tonight

30:09.060 --> 30:12.540
About how we got our name because he was talking about

30:13.200 --> 30:18.060
Orange lounge, you know the group doing boba moga all the bimani stuff

30:18.460 --> 30:22.020
We were sitting on the part one day. Mm-hmm saying, you know, damn it

30:22.020 --> 30:26.740
We want to do it internet really is a train in the Bay Area. Yeah, I don't know the Bay Area rapid transit. Yeah

30:26.740 --> 30:33.060
And we just came up with the name because it was Bimani because our show was our three-hour show is Bimani related

30:33.060 --> 30:34.020
And that's how we started off

30:34.020 --> 30:34.740
Yeah

30:34.740 --> 30:40.980
Originally the focus of the whole station was supposed to be music based games and that's what our three-hour show we do on Sunday night

30:40.980 --> 30:45.840
Is still kind of an homage to but we're branching out. We want to talk about all the games now

30:45.840 --> 30:49.640
We're taking our kind of brand and we want to expand, you know, that's what any good business does, right?

30:49.660 --> 30:55.820
So orange lounge was just kind of like, you know, you you like something you name yourself after something related to it

30:55.820 --> 31:01.240
So we thought lounge because we kind of lounge around and have that whole Denny's vibe of just sitting around

31:01.780 --> 31:06.820
Coffee and just talking about random stuff. That's kind of what we do. So orange lounge just seemed appropriate

31:06.860 --> 31:12.200
So we've got an email from one of our longtime listeners Asian buddy Paul. Yes

31:12.740 --> 31:16.120
Said I just like to say how much I love the podcast

31:16.120 --> 31:21.140
I used to listen to the live show Sundays, but I can't catch them anymore tier. I so I love it

31:21.940 --> 31:23.700
thank you and

31:23.700 --> 31:28.340
He just got married on his Ragnarok online private server. So congratulations, I think and

31:29.220 --> 31:32.760
Once no nerd you nerd. Yeah

31:33.740 --> 31:35.740
Married in the online game you nerd

31:36.460 --> 31:39.540
Play one of our cage match winning songs. Oh

31:40.060 --> 31:46.100
The cage match we do is part of the three-hour show when we hear the podcast random music and I'd actually answered back saying

31:46.100 --> 31:49.340
You know sort of separate this that and the other you run into all those

31:49.340 --> 31:53.740
licensing problem because our live station is run through live 365 which

31:53.740 --> 31:59.740
pays a lot of licensing fees up front. When it comes to podcasts, can you play

31:59.740 --> 32:03.540
copyrighted music and podcasts? It's kind of a big question mark right now because

32:03.540 --> 32:07.820
you know it's it's kind of a gray area so we don't do it on this. If you want to

32:07.820 --> 32:12.620
hear tonight's winner it was Destination Blackout from Wengan Midnight Maximum Tune.

32:12.620 --> 32:16.340
That's right from Wengan so check that out that'll be on our live station on

32:16.340 --> 32:17.840
on the music show that we did there.

32:17.840 --> 32:19.340
I so kicked Dan's ass in that game.

32:19.340 --> 32:19.840
It was great.

32:19.840 --> 32:20.840
All right, all right.

32:20.840 --> 32:21.340
Any Marios?

32:21.340 --> 32:21.840
Emails?

32:21.840 --> 32:22.840
Yeah, we do.

32:22.840 --> 32:24.840
And I'm just trying to get back to it.

32:24.840 --> 32:26.340
Jaime emailed us.

32:26.340 --> 32:29.840
Our good friend Jaime, who's not Jaime,

32:29.840 --> 32:35.840
sent a link to a game called Dance Praise.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.340
I saw this link.

32:37.340 --> 32:38.340
Oh my gosh.

32:38.340 --> 32:40.340
So this is Dance Dance Revolution,

32:40.340 --> 32:41.840
except it's all Christian music.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.340
DDR God version.

32:43.340 --> 32:51.220
It's like they took a bunch of Christian music labels and put it together, made their own

32:51.220 --> 32:52.220
version of DDR.

32:52.220 --> 32:58.620
Actually, looking at this now, because for a moment I was thinking, oh, DDR, yay, but

32:58.620 --> 33:00.060
it does reverse scrolling.

33:00.060 --> 33:03.520
Yeah, it's kind of, well, they have to change it a little bit or they might get sued by

33:03.520 --> 33:06.300
Konami just like, you know, the folks who made In the Groove got sued.

33:06.300 --> 33:11.180
Honestly, it shows them freaking plan on Konami dance pads.

33:11.180 --> 33:13.180
It's a damn StepMania version.

33:13.180 --> 33:15.180
It's StepMania, is all it is at StepMania.

33:15.180 --> 33:19.180
Probably. But, you know, if that's what you're looking for in a dance game,

33:19.180 --> 33:25.180
I'd go for it, but I don't see this being the next big thing in dance games.

33:25.180 --> 33:30.180
You know, I chalked this right up there with other classic, um,

33:30.180 --> 33:34.180
video games made for retail sales in Christian bookstores.

33:34.180 --> 33:35.180
It makes me think of the...

33:35.180 --> 33:36.180
The Bible Trivia game.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.180
Yep. The Bible Trivia game and Noah's Ark.

33:38.180 --> 33:44.540
I remember the old pair a DDR parody that had the cross shape controller that had the two down arrows. Oh, yeah

33:44.540 --> 33:47.020
Um, I forgot what that was. That was

33:47.580 --> 33:49.580
That was a can stance resurrection

33:50.260 --> 33:52.260
That was okay, whatever

33:52.660 --> 33:58.580
Want to talk about another bad game? They have the friends trivia game. We've got a cell friends tricky

33:58.580 --> 34:00.580
I think I saw that

34:01.580 --> 34:04.780
Here's the here's the best-selling part of it. Hmm it is

34:04.780 --> 34:12.780
um all the menus and stuff and the host is played by the really annoying friend

34:12.780 --> 34:21.780
dress your character yeah she had nothing to do with friends no no no her

34:21.780 --> 34:27.440
her character is not not friend dresser but the character in it I owe the one

34:27.440 --> 34:30.620
who was the girlfriend yeah I can't remember her name I don't watch the show

34:30.620 --> 34:35.080
So the one who had the really annoying one the hi

34:36.500 --> 34:37.500
Okay

34:37.500 --> 34:43.020
Okay, seriously, our listeners are gonna write hate mail for that. Thank you. Hey, I gotta answer it. So all right

34:43.420 --> 34:47.500
Anyway, if you know if that's what you're looking for in a dance game go for it

34:47.500 --> 34:50.260
But I don't think the quality of the game since let's face it

34:50.260 --> 34:54.720
It is being put out by a much much much much much smaller company

34:54.720 --> 34:59.240
I don't think it's going to be that smooth a game, but whatever have fun

35:00.320 --> 35:02.320
Well any other emails that it?

35:02.920 --> 35:08.560
Other than the one I mentioned from about the controller right, but we've addressed that cool deal all right

35:08.560 --> 35:12.000
We'll send us more mail. We like getting mail right Jamie um yes

35:12.000 --> 35:17.480
We do send them send Jamie some email about how much you love her giggling your incessant giggling on this program. I

35:18.160 --> 35:20.160
Am not a giggler

35:20.160 --> 35:27.160
ToGo at OrangeLoungeRadio.com

35:27.160 --> 35:29.160
I'm giggling now because I keep calling you a giggler

35:29.160 --> 35:31.160
I did find something cool internet related though

35:31.160 --> 35:32.160
Oh what's that?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.160
Just a really short thing

35:33.160 --> 35:36.160
For folks like me who like to use Firefox

35:36.160 --> 35:39.160
There's a skin for it called Pipzilla

35:39.160 --> 35:42.160
That makes your top tool bar all fuzzy

35:42.160 --> 35:45.160
And then the background behind your tab is all leopard print

35:45.160 --> 35:46.160
I just thought that people

35:46.160 --> 35:47.160
Where can they download that?

35:47.160 --> 35:49.160
Can we put a link on our site somewhere?

35:49.160 --> 35:54.880
I'll hunt it down again, but the the font and all the buttons and everything look like they're straight out of the Grand Theft Auto

35:54.880 --> 35:59.520
San Andreas is great cute, and they're all bling-shaped and everything. It's cool cute

36:00.080 --> 36:06.960
All right, let's get into some more gaming news. One thing we mentioned earlier in the program was Katamari Damacy

36:07.960 --> 36:13.960
There is another Katamari Damacy game on the way. So I really hope this series isn't jumping the shark yet

36:13.960 --> 36:15.840
But I think it's still got some good life left in it

36:15.840 --> 36:19.240
it's rolling over the shark and absorbing it into its collective we'll

36:19.240 --> 36:24.160
see Famitsu the big gaming magazine in Japan they are reporting boku no

36:24.160 --> 36:29.320
watashi no katamari damashi coming out for the PSP so it's gonna be a PSP yours

36:29.320 --> 36:36.840
in my katamari I something told me train us to boku no is mine somebody told me

36:36.840 --> 36:41.580
it's translate to my my katamari mosh read this three the title again boku no

36:41.580 --> 36:48.840
Watashi no Katamari Dimashii. Yeah Mai Mai Katamari. So whatever. Yeah. Boku no is like

36:48.840 --> 36:53.840
boy saying. Atashi no is like girl saying. Okay okay. So it's like it sounds like

36:53.840 --> 36:57.160
it's little boys and girls saying are Katamari. Not a whole lot known about

36:57.160 --> 37:01.560
this game just yet. Wi-Fi support though is rumored to be in it. Branching

37:01.560 --> 37:05.880
storylines like night and day and other kind of modes like that are gonna be in

37:05.880 --> 37:10.360
it so that would be kind of cool to see. So that is rumored that's being shown at

37:10.360 --> 37:13.700
Tokyo Game Show. I didn't hear if it was playable or not. I just know it's being shown.

37:13.700 --> 37:17.720
It was. It was playable? Lucky. Yeah, there's actually people

37:17.720 --> 37:21.160
saying that the controls sucked on it.

37:21.160 --> 37:26.760
Oh no. Because the... You know it can't be that great. Well, because you can't do dual analogs,

37:26.760 --> 37:28.080
so what it is is it's

37:28.080 --> 37:31.160
the directional button and the four buttons are the two sticks.

37:31.160 --> 37:35.600
I knew it would be like that. And that kinda sucked. Well, the person that was

37:35.600 --> 37:38.620
looking at it was saying that they had hoped that it would have been like the

37:38.620 --> 37:43.900
analog and turning with the shoulder buttons, which would be good.

37:43.900 --> 37:49.860
It is, from what I remember on the plot for it, is that apparently there's some island

37:49.860 --> 37:54.220
that's in trouble that has animals on it or whatever and you have to, you arrive there

37:54.220 --> 37:57.820
on a boat or something and you have to save the animals or something by absorbing them

37:57.820 --> 37:58.820
in gear.

37:58.820 --> 37:59.820
By rolling them over?

37:59.820 --> 38:00.820
I guess.

38:00.820 --> 38:01.820
Getting them into a star.

38:01.820 --> 38:07.420
I guess, I don't know, but that was what I had heard and it was pretty interesting, but

38:07.420 --> 38:13.660
But um, I don't know, I'm all for Katamari coming to the PSP so, hell yeah.

38:13.660 --> 38:17.460
Alright um, one other PSP story I definitely want to make sure we cover at some point also

38:17.460 --> 38:19.460
being shown at the Tokyo Game Show.

38:19.460 --> 38:24.340
You guys know that Suikoden 1 and 2, they are an absolute bitch to find, I mean you

38:24.340 --> 38:28.020
could be paying like $100 for a copy of Suikoden 2 on eBay.

38:28.020 --> 38:29.260
Well guess what?

38:29.260 --> 38:34.660
They are both coming out, again, together on the PSP, this being announced at the Tokyo

38:34.660 --> 38:35.660
Game Show.

38:35.660 --> 38:39.460
Suikoden fans, if you've been dying to play Suikoden 2 for a while, you just can't seem

38:39.460 --> 38:44.540
to get a copy of it, it's going to be coming out for the PSP along with Suikoden 1, so

38:44.540 --> 38:45.540
that's going to be pretty cool.

38:45.540 --> 38:50.460
No estimated release on this, but probably not until next year at some point.

38:50.460 --> 38:54.280
Again, this is only Japan so far, but heck, why not?

38:54.280 --> 38:55.880
Should come out over here too, right?

38:55.880 --> 38:58.180
Just a little bit of translation, right?

38:58.180 --> 38:59.180
We'll see.

38:59.180 --> 39:02.600
Loki, you got some gaming news for us, or, I'm sorry, was something going on in the hack

39:02.600 --> 39:03.600
and crack scene?

39:03.600 --> 39:10.600
Yeah, couple things actually. The first being that the rumored Team Extender, they're actually

39:11.200 --> 39:18.200
creating this video out for the PSP. So you can watch your UMDs and everything on normal

39:19.320 --> 39:24.980
TV and they had a demo of it. What this thing does, and it looks like it's a whole case

39:24.980 --> 39:30.560
replace of it. You basically unscrew the case and pop this sucker on. It has actually a

39:30.560 --> 39:34.660
port to plug in a DualShock controller so you can use that as the controller and then

39:34.660 --> 39:39.660
play your games on the TV that way. You know what's funny is, and this was even just last

39:39.660 --> 39:45.980
night, I had gone back after my trip to IKEA and stopped by to see Dan at Gamestop and

39:45.980 --> 39:50.180
I was saying, they should make a TV tuner for the PSP. Well, wasn't it rumored that

39:50.180 --> 39:56.760
PS3 was going to have a UMD slot in it? That was sort of a rumor but I don't think it's

39:56.760 --> 40:01.960
going to happen. That's what everyone was speculating. It should. It would make sense,

40:01.960 --> 40:05.480
but no. I mean, think about it though, especially with the success that they've been having

40:05.480 --> 40:08.920
with the movies, which, you know, is kind of odd to me. I mean, I understand why they

40:08.920 --> 40:12.020
put movies on PSP, but I don't see why it's so successful. It would make perfect sense.

40:12.020 --> 40:15.200
Because then Sony could like really compete with like DVD, but they would have like their

40:15.200 --> 40:20.960
own version. I think it would be very smart to put it in there. I know. Because then they

40:20.960 --> 40:27.160
can have it okay, you know, you can, if you buy this version of the movie, not only will

40:27.160 --> 40:31.120
you be able to play it on your TV, but you can also take it on the go with you, and,

40:31.120 --> 40:34.280
you know, it's kind of, it would be interesting.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.560
It would be smart, but I don't think you're gonna do it.

40:36.560 --> 40:41.920
But yeah, so this thing is actually being, I guess, beta'd right now, they're working

40:41.920 --> 40:47.760
out the kinks in it, but from the screenshots I've seen it looks good, have selectable widescreen

40:47.760 --> 40:52.320
and pan and scan you know if you want to like fill your whole TV but um it should

40:52.320 --> 40:58.120
be cool I mean I don't think so but um of course it'll stretch it if you know

40:58.120 --> 41:02.820
you try to take it out of widescreen but um you know hey I'm all for modding my

41:02.820 --> 41:08.240
PSP so I'm interested about resolution when you get into high into larger

41:08.240 --> 41:12.040
high-definition format and how about support for widescreen TVs huh I don't

41:12.040 --> 41:16.320
know I'm just saying well here's what it is okay basically if you want to get to

41:16.320 --> 41:23.320
the nitty-gritty of this. The PSP already has a video out on it. It's the USB. Because

41:24.640 --> 41:29.320
when you're playing your games, the USB acts like a video out. For those of you who are

41:29.320 --> 41:33.520
very interested in trying to make one, you probably could. All this thing is is just

41:33.520 --> 41:40.520
adding some more support so really that USB port can be exploited to a lot. Anyways, so

41:40.520 --> 41:45.360
So other than this... Who said the term nitty-gritty?

41:45.360 --> 41:48.920
I know, and I'm sorry. I instantly started thinking nitty-gritty-driven.

41:48.920 --> 41:52.100
The other thing, I was going to say, was it,

41:52.100 --> 41:57.080
the site P6, who's doing this kind of a new,

41:57.080 --> 41:59.800
you know, graphic user interface for

41:59.800 --> 42:02.960
the PSP, which looks pretty sexy, but still

42:02.960 --> 42:04.520
working out the kinks on that.

42:04.520 --> 42:07.880
They actually have a tutorial here on how to,

42:07.880 --> 42:13.480
If you really want to mod your PSP, you can change all the menus what their, you know,

42:13.480 --> 42:14.480
titles are.

42:14.480 --> 42:21.080
So you can make it, you know, like UMD as in, you know, movie player or, you know, your,

42:21.080 --> 42:25.280
you know, system settings as I fucked your mom or something like that, you know.

42:25.280 --> 42:30.680
So you can do whatever you want and there's a tutorial on their site and that's pretty

42:30.680 --> 42:31.680
interesting.

42:31.680 --> 42:37.840
There's a link on PSP updates for that and on our site as well once we put it on there.

42:37.840 --> 42:42.120
And yeah, that's pretty much it. There's some really cool Tetris game that came out called

42:42.120 --> 42:48.300
Hack and you should check that out too, it looks pretty cool. The link we'll have on

42:48.300 --> 42:55.620
our page as well. Oh, oh, and how did I forget this? Ceramic PSPs came out, the white ones.

42:55.620 --> 43:00.640
Don't drop it. Yeah. The new white ones, and they fixed some of the button issues with

43:00.640 --> 43:05.240
the bottom buttons, you know, your home and start and stuff. They raised them up so you

43:05.240 --> 43:10.040
you can access them better and they fix the square button problem and I think

43:10.040 --> 43:13.980
those are only available in Japan right now but I think they're also over here

43:13.980 --> 43:18.180
pretty soon cool sounds good yeah Dark Sakura what kind of gaming news do you

43:18.180 --> 43:23.620
have for us tonight I've got a couple things about Final Fantasy actually

43:23.620 --> 43:28.520
dirge of a service oh cool been trying to hunt down a release date because I

43:28.520 --> 43:31.560
I want my Hot Vincent action.

43:31.560 --> 43:36.080
And it's speculated the date tentative in Japan

43:36.080 --> 43:39.840
is sometime in 2005, no US release date yet.

43:39.840 --> 43:40.680
They did however.

43:40.680 --> 43:41.880
Which means next summer.

43:41.880 --> 43:42.800
Yeah.

43:42.800 --> 43:45.160
But you know, with every Final Fantasy game

43:45.160 --> 43:46.320
that's practically ever been out,

43:46.320 --> 43:48.720
except for like what, four when it came out,

43:48.720 --> 43:49.800
we're gonna get more stuff.

43:49.800 --> 43:51.840
And they're gonna release an international version

43:51.840 --> 43:52.840
and they're gonna get more stuff

43:52.840 --> 43:53.880
and I'm gonna have to import it

43:53.880 --> 43:55.520
and it's gonna of course be in English.

43:55.520 --> 43:58.060
So they better have someone Hot do Vincent's voice.

43:58.060 --> 44:06.460
Anyway, um, ooh, could you imagine, um, great, now I can't remember his name, uh, Boreanus.

44:06.460 --> 44:07.460
David Boreanus.

44:07.460 --> 44:09.140
David Boreanus, doing Vincent's voice.

44:09.140 --> 44:13.160
He's too busy doing, um, Squall in Kingdom Hearts.

44:13.160 --> 44:14.500
That's almost all already done.

44:14.500 --> 44:15.500
I know.

44:15.500 --> 44:16.500
I'm just saying.

44:16.500 --> 44:17.500
Yeah, Kingdom Hearts 2, also.

44:17.500 --> 44:18.500
Whoa.

44:18.500 --> 44:19.500
Which I got to play at E3.

44:19.500 --> 44:22.380
The nice guy at Boyinavista played a lot of it so I could take pictures, which are on

44:22.380 --> 44:23.900
our website at Orangetownsradio.com.

44:23.900 --> 44:25.300
Hey, hey, blog, blog.

44:25.300 --> 44:32.300
Anyway, but they released some of the concept artwork for some of the enemies in the game.

44:32.300 --> 44:38.300
The deep ground soldiers who go underground after the meteor incident, we all played Final Fantasy VII.

44:38.300 --> 44:42.300
There's a Sahagin, Gargoyle, those are some of the things.

44:42.300 --> 44:47.300
And of course, looking at a movie file, which Loki was kind enough to show me,

44:47.300 --> 44:54.300
it looks like it's going to be an over-the-shoulder perspective, sort of first-person shooter-y-ish.

44:54.300 --> 44:58.420
but it looked like it actually sort of made me think a little bit like it's

44:58.420 --> 45:03.380
like Devil May Cry featuring Vincent mm-hmm sort of the like that that's not

45:03.380 --> 45:07.320
a bad thing no but there better not be any freaking

45:07.320 --> 45:14.260
era than a girl scream hate her also speaking about the Final Fantasy 7

45:14.260 --> 45:20.700
franchise was reading an interview from our friends at one up calm mm-hmm with

45:20.700 --> 45:26.820
Tetsuya Nomura, who's as we know the director of Kingdom Hearts 2 and Final

45:26.820 --> 45:36.540
Fantasy 7 Advent Children, stating that he very much wants to sort of expand on

45:36.540 --> 45:41.900
the Final Fantasy 7 tech demo and completely remake the game. I've said this on

45:41.900 --> 45:45.560
previous podcasts, I highly speculate it's already in the works and they're

45:45.560 --> 45:49.620
just keeping a real tight lid on it. I think it's gonna be a surprise at next

45:49.620 --> 45:57.620
E3 but I I don't know I might be wrong what can you do all we can do is wait

45:57.620 --> 46:02.100
but I'll tell you if it's if it's out I know which of those systems I'm getting

46:02.100 --> 46:05.780
first mm-hmm that's all there is to that know what else is coming out for the

46:05.780 --> 46:11.420
ps3 hmm remake of Gradius oh I heard I had a story cued up on that you're

46:11.420 --> 46:17.060
sorry all right no no no it's a wonderful transition into your part even

46:17.060 --> 46:18.060
Even though I have something else.

46:18.060 --> 46:19.060
That's alright.

46:19.060 --> 46:20.060
I'll get back to you here.

46:20.060 --> 46:21.060
Let me get the story I have here.

46:21.060 --> 46:25.060
I'll go cry in my little giggling, ditzy corner.

46:25.060 --> 46:26.060
Gradius.

46:26.060 --> 46:33.940
Gradius will be coming out on the PlayStation 3 coming out of the Tokyo Game Show.

46:33.940 --> 46:37.860
There really isn't a whole lot else to say except Gradius is coming out in a brand new

46:37.860 --> 46:39.900
PlayStation 3 form.

46:39.900 --> 46:41.380
What else is there to say?

46:41.380 --> 46:42.380
It's Gradius.

46:42.380 --> 46:43.620
It's PlayStation 3.

46:43.620 --> 46:48.700
It's going to be very sexy, especially if some of the famous Konami musicians, such

46:48.700 --> 46:52.900
as Kiryamoka or some of the other people they have there, are doing the music for it.

46:52.900 --> 46:54.820
It will be very sexy indeed.

46:54.820 --> 46:55.820
Sign me up.

46:55.820 --> 46:56.820
Thank you.

46:56.820 --> 46:57.820
Gradius is de-hot.

46:57.820 --> 47:01.060
Alright, that was all I had.

47:01.060 --> 47:05.840
And Jamie, you also said what I was going to on Final Fantasy VII, but that's okay.

47:05.840 --> 47:07.100
I don't mind.

47:07.100 --> 47:08.100
Share the wealth.

47:08.100 --> 47:10.660
Hey, if it's Final Fantasy VII, it's alright.

47:10.660 --> 47:12.560
But if it's Final Fantasy XI, I'll handle it.

47:12.560 --> 47:21.520
can handle the cracks. There's also speculation, according to Bloomberg.com, you know, financial,

47:21.520 --> 47:27.960
blah, blah, blah, that Konami and Capcom may be Japan's next big merger. That would be

47:27.960 --> 47:36.320
weird. And to quote my, it's so weird saying husband. I'm so married now. But he was saying

47:36.320 --> 47:42.380
were they going to be called Capcom? Capcom. Oh, that would just be weird. I don't know.

47:42.380 --> 47:47.980
Those I don't see it happening. I don't either but a lot of these companies to do a quote in here

47:48.620 --> 47:50.060
from a

47:50.060 --> 47:52.060
Takashi, oh yeah, who's an analyst with

47:52.660 --> 47:54.660
joint securities in Tokyo

47:54.660 --> 48:00.140
So companies like Taito Bandai and Namco are not merging because they are facing the financial ruin

48:00.180 --> 48:03.980
They're looking three years down the road and thinking this might be a strategic choice

48:04.140 --> 48:10.460
Hmm, and if these big you know because Taito Namco all those are really freaking huge

48:10.460 --> 48:17.060
I know it's so weird that all these game companies are suddenly like it's like we have they're forming into the giant mechatron

48:17.060 --> 48:19.060
we have Sega Sammy and

48:19.800 --> 48:24.820
Which is weird all in itself, but be very few, but I mean honestly

48:25.380 --> 48:29.440
You're taking your fourth largest and sixth largest video game manufacturer

48:29.440 --> 48:37.120
Mm-hmm and think of how big that's gonna be huge be huge and both of them have very popular franchises to neither make a man

48:37.120 --> 48:43.600
Castlevania no I mean we might get DDR with Mega Man who knows be interesting

48:43.600 --> 48:47.300
I know the weird thing is when I read this story I didn't read it on

48:47.300 --> 48:50.820
Bloomberg.com I read it on a gaming site that was referring to that article I

48:50.820 --> 48:56.740
interpreted it as Konami and Capcom were both looking to acquire new companies I

48:56.740 --> 49:00.020
didn't quite get that at first that they were looking to acquire each other I

49:00.020 --> 49:03.540
think that would be kind of weird there's another comment in here that

49:03.540 --> 49:07.220
sort of bugged me. I'm just gonna read this little paragraph here.

49:07.220 --> 49:11.940
What's that? Konami is trying to break its reliance on the video game business,

49:11.940 --> 49:16.100
where earnings depend on hit titles, and find new revenue sources by expanding

49:16.100 --> 49:19.780
into toys, sports club, arcade machinery, and casino businesses.

49:19.780 --> 49:24.980
Which actually, you know, I saw a number of Konami-made

49:24.980 --> 49:30.740
slot machines when I was at the casino a couple weekends ago from my

49:30.740 --> 49:36.500
my honeymoon. And Konami has always been into fitness equipment. I mean, they're

49:36.500 --> 49:43.860
even working on a mock-up of DDR to be used as a fitness, as a basically

49:43.860 --> 49:46.940
automated aerobics machine. Right. It's been a few months since we've heard

49:46.940 --> 49:50.020
anything on that. I wonder if that ever came out or what. I saw the mock-up on it

49:50.020 --> 49:54.460
and there's there's another one I want to read here too, a quote by Yuta

49:54.460 --> 50:00.660
Sakurai, who's an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in Tokyo. Konami

50:00.660 --> 50:04.540
which took a break after three years of aggressive expansion is now back into

50:04.540 --> 50:09.220
attack mode possibly reviving their acquisition plans consolidation is

50:09.220 --> 50:12.500
gaining pace and music movie broadcasting companies that internet

50:12.500 --> 50:18.180
portals are possible partners hmm so yeah looking at this from the business

50:18.180 --> 50:24.980
side that actually does make a lot of sense and it's it's saying on here that

50:24.980 --> 50:30.880
speculated target for Konami is Capcom. Interesting. Right now, Konami is number

50:30.880 --> 50:34.920
four, Capcom is number six. It makes financial sense. All right. See what happens.

50:34.920 --> 50:40.100
That would be kind of... just be weird. We'll see though. We'll see. That would be like

50:40.100 --> 50:46.080
taking my heart and breaking it in two and putting it back together. Why? Because I

50:46.080 --> 50:51.880
love Konami and I love Capcom and seeing, you know, it's like having... it's like

50:51.880 --> 50:58.560
Like having hamsters, you know how if one of your hamsters feels like it's threatened,

50:58.560 --> 51:02.520
its babies are threatened, its assets are threatened, it's gonna go kill the other hamster

51:02.520 --> 51:03.520
and eat it.

51:03.520 --> 51:04.520
It's true!

51:04.520 --> 51:05.520
Hamsters do that!

51:05.520 --> 51:06.520
I know, I know.

51:06.520 --> 51:15.440
It's not the best analogy, but you know, it's dog eat dog in this case.

51:15.440 --> 51:17.080
Hamster eat hamster?

51:17.080 --> 51:18.720
Hamster eat hamster.

51:18.720 --> 51:19.720
Alright.

51:19.720 --> 51:21.720
Anything else for us, DarkSakura?

51:21.720 --> 51:25.480
No, all right. I like fire. I know you do

51:25.480 --> 51:30.080
I know you do you like to do, but that that's when you truly giggle is when you set things on fire

51:30.080 --> 51:32.560
Oh, yeah, all right, but only when they scream

51:34.800 --> 51:36.720
Zeno saga

51:36.720 --> 51:39.580
Zeno saga is coming out to the Nintendo TS

51:40.560 --> 51:45.540
Zeno saga one and two specifically no it's not going to be the full-blown

51:45.540 --> 51:51.420
3D movie element that you see in Xenosaga. No, they're gonna redo it all

51:51.420 --> 51:57.020
cutesy anime style in a 2D isometric type style, but still, that's kind of cool.

51:57.020 --> 52:00.660
I mean, to remake a game that was out on the PlayStation 2 and just kind of like

52:00.660 --> 52:04.500
remake all the graphics and all the stuff behind it, and it's still gonna

52:04.500 --> 52:07.540
have cutscenes, it's just gonna be done differently. Well, they're gonna remake

52:07.540 --> 52:13.180
that into a DS title, Xenosaga 1 & 2, that also coming out of Tokyo Game Show

52:13.180 --> 52:18.700
from Monolith Soft. Should be very interesting. Xenosaga episode 3, by the way, is coming

52:18.700 --> 52:24.980
out for the Playstation 2, if you were not aware. Alright. Loki, did you have anything

52:24.980 --> 52:28.180
else for us tonight? I saw you had a story up there, so I'm curious.

52:28.180 --> 52:33.900
I'm just looking at some of the stuff that they've been showing at, you know, Tokyo Game

52:33.900 --> 52:39.980
Show. Just some of the new games that look really awesome. For example, they were kind

52:39.980 --> 52:46.420
showing some of the high res pictures from some of the tech demos we saw at E3 like Motorstorm

52:46.420 --> 52:52.060
which looks freaking awesome, it's like burnout meets off-road racing.

52:52.060 --> 52:56.580
My favorite though is just some of the detailed shots that they've been showing for Metal

52:56.580 --> 53:01.360
Gear Solid 4, just the amount of detail that's in this is incredible.

53:01.360 --> 53:08.440
The other game that looks really cool is the, what was it, Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter.

53:08.440 --> 53:11.800
Some of the stuff in there actually looks like CNN footage.

53:11.800 --> 53:15.920
That's how detailed it is.

53:15.920 --> 53:19.600
And also, what really scares me is they're talking about making it a little in the dark

53:19.600 --> 53:24.400
for the PS3, so that might give Ooey Bowl some inspiration to make another movie.

53:24.400 --> 53:28.000
We can't have that, so I hope not.

53:28.000 --> 53:29.000
Yeah.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.000
Alright.

53:30.000 --> 53:32.320
I got one more story for you guys tonight then.

53:32.320 --> 53:33.320
It's a brand new piece.

53:33.320 --> 53:35.720
This is usually the type of thing you talk about, Loki, but I'm stealing this from you

53:35.720 --> 53:38.280
tonight.

53:38.280 --> 53:46.060
video via your PSP. A company called Hori is making a brand new PSP accessory. Basically

53:46.060 --> 53:50.060
what it is, it's a little rectangle looking device and what it does is you can hook it

53:50.060 --> 53:55.940
up so that you can record video straight onto your memory stick. So that's pretty much it.

53:55.940 --> 54:01.380
You can record video using your PSP right onto your memory stick. About $115 is what

54:01.380 --> 54:06.260
it's going to cost. That's 12,800 yen coming out in November in Japan.

54:06.260 --> 54:12.140
that I think about, I think it was Hori that made those GameCube pads that I

54:12.140 --> 54:16.040
have that are like the Super Nintendo ones. Oh. But I mean, a lot of this, you know, I

54:16.040 --> 54:18.300
think that's going to be actually a really good product. A lot of the stuff

54:18.300 --> 54:21.800
that they put out was pretty good. No word yet though if that's going to come

54:21.800 --> 54:25.180
out in the U.S., so you guys may have to import that device if that sounds

54:25.180 --> 54:29.700
interesting to you, wanting to record your own homemade movies on PSP. But

54:29.700 --> 54:34.000
remember, if you're making adult films with your PSP, don't leave it where

54:34.000 --> 54:36.540
people are going to find it because they'll get put all over the internet

54:36.540 --> 54:42.340
like you know the celebrities like Pam Anderson and stuff. On that note that's

54:42.340 --> 54:45.420
going to do it for tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio To Go. Thank you guys

54:45.420 --> 54:49.840
so much for tuning in, subscribing to us. Tell somebody you know and you love

54:49.840 --> 54:53.220
about Orange Lounge Radio and and help spread the word. In fact, tell somebody

54:53.220 --> 54:59.020
you hate about Orange Lounge Radio. TEEHEE, TEEHEE, insert bad joke here. That's right.

54:59.020 --> 55:05.200
and a reminder to check orange launch radio.com and check out our Hurricane

55:05.200 --> 55:08.280
Katrina relief we're doing with the other Sacramento companies Dark Records

55:08.280 --> 55:14.320
and Club 21 and we'll see you guys next time here on the podcast final thoughts

55:14.320 --> 55:21.040
Loki there's a funny website Rockstar made to kind of hit back at Jack

55:21.040 --> 55:28.040
Thompson. It's called Citizens United Negating Technology dot org. And for those that aren't

55:30.200 --> 55:34.120
too witty out there, that would be the acronym CUNT.

55:34.120 --> 55:36.640
Thank you. Thank you for that.

55:36.640 --> 55:42.440
And it's quite funny. It's basically a parody of, you know, just the Jack Thompson argument

55:42.440 --> 55:49.040
and the first thing that pops up is, welcome to our site, turn off the internet. It's funny.

55:49.040 --> 55:55.880
There's a whole bunch of emails or fake emails I should say that are on the Liberty City

55:55.880 --> 56:00.440
Stories webpage so go check those out as well.

56:00.440 --> 56:05.120
My final thought is I'm still craving a milkshake now that you both had them during the three

56:05.120 --> 56:07.320
hour program earlier this evening and I didn't.

56:07.320 --> 56:10.280
I'm suffering before it comforts you.

56:10.280 --> 56:11.280
Not really.

56:11.280 --> 56:12.280
Not really.

56:12.280 --> 56:13.280
Darkstalker, your final thought.

56:13.280 --> 56:15.040
Two sort of final thoughts.

56:15.040 --> 56:16.420
I'm correcting myself.

56:16.420 --> 56:22.860
It wasn't police knots that had the mini RC lookin' metal gear like Otacon was using.

56:22.860 --> 56:28.300
It was Snatcher, which is another Kojima game that was on Sega CD.

56:28.300 --> 56:30.220
Good luck finding it.

56:30.220 --> 56:31.260
And your second final thought?

56:31.260 --> 56:32.260
Reject false icons.

56:32.260 --> 56:33.260
Of course.

56:33.260 --> 56:35.500
I'm gonna go ditz my way off now.

56:35.500 --> 56:41.320
Alright, have fun with that, and from us to you, have a great day, afternoon or evening

56:41.320 --> 56:44.100
whenever you're listening to this, and we'll see you next time on Orange Lawn's Radio To

56:44.100 --> 56:45.100
Go.

56:45.100 --> 56:50.900
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition. This podcast is a

56:50.900 --> 56:56.740
