And woah woah woah woah

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Won't you take my hand but I will be your man

4
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
So look tonight we're gonna dance the night away

5

One and one is two

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,000
Don't you feel so cool

7
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,500
Synchronize love that's what we've got to do

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
All the time we'll be together

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,760
We'll be together, cause it's yours and mine

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:04,200
Forever we're in this love chain

11
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,040
I won't be a fan

12
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,880
So look tonight, we're gonna miss a night away

13
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,880
One and one is two

14
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,800
Don't you be so cruel

15
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:17,880
Synchronize this love, it's what we got to do

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,120
All the time

17
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,960

18
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,960

Other stuff, including my obsession with We Heart Katamari as of this week.

00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,680
I cannot stop playing this game.

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:35,680
That's a highly sore point with me.

28
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,680
No one in my work wanted it, so I got it by default.

29
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,680
Wow. Okay, well, we'll get to all things Bomani and all things gaming.

30

In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, Ms. Dark Sakura, Tami Summers.

64
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,860
He just lied.

65
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:39,860
I totally just lied.

66
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,860
He totally just lied.

67
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,860
She's not a bunny.

68
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:45,860
She's a giggling schoolgirl. We established that on the last podcast.

69
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,860
Oh, I got the glare. I got the glare, kids.

70
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:49,860
I don't find that funny at all.

71
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,860
Sorry.

72
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,860
Because I don't appreciate sexism.

73
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,860
I'm only talking about that later on.

74
00:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,860
Um, actually, okay.

75
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,860
All right.

76
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,860
Gave him another day.

77
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,860
Good. Good to hear.

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,860
It probably pissed me off.

79
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:07,860
All right, I'll be talking about reasons for that throughout tonight's show.

80
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,860
Also, say hello to Tech Master Loki.

81
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:16,620
I appreciate all forms of sex, including those with, um, you know, whatever suffixes you

82
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,620
have.

83
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,620
Um.

84
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:19,620
What?

85
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,100
Sexism, sex, you name it.

86
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,260
Oh, I get it.

87
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,260
I think.

88
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,260
Um.

89
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
I know, it went over your head.

90
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,260
It's okay.

91
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
Yeah, that's alright.

92
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:29,260

93
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,260

94
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:33,300

00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:42,160
Because we're going to be doing an In the Groove game giveaway.

174
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,640
I don't know if we're doing that tonight, we have to think of the rules for how we want

175
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:51,400
the giveaway to work, so we're going to talk about that, however this copy of In the Groove

176
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,600
has a special treat with it, it's not just any copy of In the Groove, it is an In the

177
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:03,200
Groove copy signed by Loki, DarkSakura, and myself, with our own little sayings on it

178
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
for you guys.

179
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,800
Signed is such a wonderful word, I would say deface.

180
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:12,240
whatever we're just gonna let us have our way with this game and then we're

181
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,600
gonna give it away to some lucky listener and we don't know exactly how

182
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,120
we're gonna do that yet but I do know that we're gonna also give a give away

183
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:29,200
some v-rares we've got some v-rares for DDR max 2 and DDR EX 2 so of course the

184
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,000

185
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,880
the games out this is the only way you're really gonna you know maybe get

214
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,480
let's play a little bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, let's go around and see

215
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,560
how people's week was and their day, because after all, this show isn't just about games,

216
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,560
It's about us and our egos. DarkSakura.

217
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:53,560
That week was just, eh, regular stuff.

218
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:57,560
Um, I played a few games.

219
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,560
Hung out. I mean, Dan was gone most of the week at the GameStop

220
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:05,560
uh, uh, manager conference in Texas.

221
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:09,560
So um, I sat around by myself a lot, um, except for

222
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,560
going to a party, going to the club,

223
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:17,960
Playing with my Nintendogs, playing some Beatmania, playing World of Warcraft.

224
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,120
Really, that's about it. Oh, yeah, and I played on the main for a little bit, a bit more, uh, Puyo Puyo, arcade version, and

225
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:29,960
Blazing Star and Pulsar, or Pulsar, I'm sorry, and

226
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:37,160
Metal Slug 5 and a bunch of crap just because I was really bored hanging out in the garage doing laundry.

227
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
And

228
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:47,720
That's really how my week went. You know, Dan came home today, which was good, and then

229
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:53,080
he promptly left to go play Madden at the neighbor's house, which he said, oh, I told

230
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:56,400
you. I was like, well, you didn't tell me where I could actually hear you when you were

231
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,040
in the same room with me. So I didn't know. He just disappeared. So I got involved in

232
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:05,140
a project, and he came like, oh, you want to play Madden with me? That game sucks, and

233
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:09,960
American football sucks. Why would I want to do something that doubly sucks? That's

234
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:16,180
okay I'm doing something that doesn't suck so now why you said in the intro

235
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:19,900
you were a little bitter over we heart katamari what's up because how can you

236
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:25,260
be bitter a game came out of GameStop he was on the plane I couldn't buy my game

237
00:21:25,260 --> 00:21:29,160
because I don't see I can wait a little bit to get something in the 30% discount

238
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:36,480
I don't see paying full price when I don't have to I am a frugal gamer so you

239
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,880
you know, buying my game, my U.S. game, so the discount means I can import my games later.

240
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,120
Gotcha, so you just have to wait a little bit until the man can, you know, pull the

241
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,720
strings. Actually go to work and pick it up, so I'm

242
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,800
not going to have it until Tuesday. Which I really don't care, since I've already

243
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:53,400
played the crap out of it in other ways. I know, that's not that bad news. I thought

244
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:57,200
for some reason, like, you know, I don't know, like, Weheart Katamari, like, slept with your

245
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:01,560
friends and ate your puppies. But I get sick of everybody talking about

246
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,200
it to me as though I've played it. Oh.

247
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,200
You did?

248
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,260
Well, yeah, I've played the Japanese one, but they talk about it as though I have it

249
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:13,600
now and I don't have it yet and act like it's, you know, the end of the world.

250
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,600
I'm like, fuck you!

251
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,140
I didn't get it the day it came out.

252
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,140
I got it yesterday.

253
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:24,360
So I don't really care to hear anything about, like, on top of that, with all the hype that's

254
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:28,640
been going on, I've hit my saturation point of Katamari.

255
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
I'll tell you, it is really good, though.

256
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,120
I wasn't disappointed.

257
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,920
I think they have a change of heart.

258
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:35,320
I think you'll have a change of heart.

259
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:35,820
I do.

260
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:36,320
I do.

261
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:40,320
Honestly, I really don't care when I get it.

262
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:44,320
As soon as I can go 24 hours without seeing or hearing

263
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,320
the word katamari, I will play it.

264
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,600
And no, I'm not joking, because I have not

265
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,360
been able to go that long without either hearing it

266
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,320
or seeing it.

267
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:58,080
So when I can go 24 hours without hearing or seeing

268
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:01,040
the word katamari, I will play it.

269
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:01,640
All right.

270
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,800
That could be a while.

271
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:10,120
It's today's secret word! When you hear today's secret word, scream real loud, huh?

272
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:11,700
Today's secret word is...

273
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,520
AKAMARI!

274
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,360
So when you hear today's secret word, scream real loud!

275
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,560
Loki, how was your week? How was your day?

276
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:24,120
I can't start off like I was going to, but okay.

277
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,940
My week is good. We actually got a lot of the wedding stuff done,

278
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:28,420
locations done,

279
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,080
uh... she has her

280
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,680
dress you being ordered

281
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:32,920
at all done

282
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,960
just britain

283
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,020
thank god

284
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,400
as of the way

285
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,960
the winging now uh...

286
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:43,120
now but actually uh...

287
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:46,120
i meant to play more games this week at the level of bernard revenge

288
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,200
per usual

289
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,440
and the one my one great book bernard revenge is their random track selection

290
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:54,380
it quite random in fact

291
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,000
i get the same track every time i do random so

292
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,520
I'm kind of wondering why, you know, it's so faulty, but it's still a fun track.

293
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,400
And then, uh...

294
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Let's see, what else? Oh, I got my free copy of Wheel of Katamari, and, um...

295
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,280
I haven't gotten a chance to play that yet, and I was trying to make time to play

296
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:17,640
Graffiti Kingdom, since I've had it for a month and haven't touched it yet.

297
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:21,000
That's right, I still haven't touched the Hello Kitty game.

298
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,400
Well, that I can understand, but, you know, Graffiti Kingdom, I was, like, drooling over, you know, when I got it,

299
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,560
and I haven't even played it.

300
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:35,560
But I'll get to it eventually, but now I have to go beg my contact to Konami for some copies of Extreme 2.

301
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:41,560
I hinted to him that I wanted some, and now I will just bluntly say, can you send me some?

302
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
So, we'll see.

303
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:48,560
But yeah, and then I've been having this urge to buy stuff, and I haven't been able to find anything.

304
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:53,320
walked around Best Buy aimlessly looking for something to buy and there was just nothing

305
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,200
there at all. Nothing. That's all. Oh, and I'm eating a block of cheese. It's almost

306
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:04,800
gone. I have to eat it because I have another block of cheese at home and they're planning

307
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:08,800
on buying me another one. So, I, you know, and I saw A Chorus of Sprites and that was

308
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:16,200
fun. It was a good movie. Good times. Alright, yeah. Bud, how was your week? How was your

309
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:25,200
I did not get a chance to play Burnout 4 because my roommate scored a free Xbox from one of his friends and has been playing Jet Set Radio Future at all hours.

310
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,200
Nothing wrong with that.

311
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,200
We only have one set of hookups at a time.

312
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:32,200
But lots of Kalamar...

313
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:34,200
That game.

314
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,200
Yeah, lots of that.

315
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:41,200
And I can't kick anyone. Damn, that would be a lot of fun.

316
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,200
Oh, you want to kick people? Here, I'll just...

317
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,200
I'm running out of gas. I'm running out of gas.

318
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,200
Wait. Oh, okay.

319
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
Ooh! Ooh, yeah!

320
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,200
Cool. I get to kick fun out of it.

321
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:56,200
Anyway, um, I played trash pick.

322
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
What?

323
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Played trash pick. Scored four IMAX last night.

324
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,200
What is that?

325
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:10,200
It's where you go around to people's trash, you know, the trash areas, and people have thrown out computers and there was four IMAX.

326
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,200
People throw out IMAX?

327
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
G3 IMAX.

328
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:19,200
Loki? No, no, Loki, no. What, Loki? What?

329
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:24,200
You mean they're good at least for their monitor? I mean, you can't...

330
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:30,200
I highly say, you know, it's wrong to throw out anything that's not broken, especially computer-wise, unless it's really old.

331
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:35,200
Because you can always use them for parts. Even if it is an iMac, you can still part that out for something.

332
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,200
That's why we picked them up.

333
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:42,200
For the monitor, at least. I mean, because, you know, a flat-screen monitor, that's... you shouldn't throw that away.

334
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:47,200
didn't throw that away. Oh no no no, these are old ones, these are the CRTs. Oh. So they

335
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:58,200
suck. They were where they belonged. How can people throw those away? Oh, oh okay. Oh my

336
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:05,200
god! You wouldn't throw away another one, I want it. It's a G3. So? I can do something

337
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:10,200
with it. Okay. You can make a flower pot out of it. They need hard drives and RAM, that's

338
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,200
That's about it.

339
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,200
Standard stuff.

340
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,200
I have all that.

341
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:22,920
In Promptu BBQ and we have We Heart something something something party last night.

342
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,840
I believe what they've come up with in the chat room is We Heart Calamari.

343
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:27,840
Like the appetizer.

344
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,840
The squid.

345
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,600
And everybody's spelling it right so I just left the chat room because everyone pissed

346
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
me off.

347
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,600
Aw.

348
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:33,600
Calamari.

349
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,600
I actually really do.

350
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,600
But anyway.

351
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:36,600
But I got off so I can still kick people.

352
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:37,600
Okay.

353
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,600
Go for it.

354
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,600
That was pretty much it.

355
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:46,600
Alright. Garrett, the pop music whore of Sacramento. What's up? How was your week? How was your

356
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:51,960
day? My week's gone. How much pop music did you play? Since what? Since like however many

357
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:58,920
months ago I was here? Yeah. Enough, I guess. Actually the other night, I don't know, I

358
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:02,560
had some really crazy night and I started beating the shit out of everything again.

359
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:08,360
Now I've actually beaten a handful of 41s. Very good. What's the highest they go, 45?

360
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,360
43 43, wow.

361
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:12,620
Yeah, I've beaten, I think, five 41s now.

362
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:15,080
I just beat Rinse EX.

363
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:17,760
I'm like, oh!

364
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,280
And then I couldn't do it after that, of course, but there's just a couple.

365
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,400
Do you have any more videos on the interweb of you playing Papa Music?

366
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:25,200
Because I remember there used to be one on Bamani Style.

367
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:28,520
Oh, I didn't even ask him to put that shit up.

368
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:34,380
And then some asshole on Bamani Style totally was just making fun of me for it, and then

369
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:37,240
he submitted his own video of him getting a better score.

370
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:41,660
whatever I just I just sent it to some people just have to show how big their

371
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,040
way I just sent to DJ P to show them like you know like oh I'm just playing

372
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:51,160
with Adobe right now I'm you know putting this shit together but yeah

373
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:55,100
okay my week's been alright I just started vacation on Friday and I'm on

374
00:28:55,100 --> 00:29:01,420
vacation for 10 days yay I'll be five days here and five days in Georgia and

375
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:05,700
what are you doing in Georgia now I'm going to a wedding it's this girl I

376
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:10,580
I grew up with and like her grandma is my one of my mom's best friends and you know

377
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:14,100
They'll you know live together or whatever. But anyway, since I've never really been out of the state

378
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:16,300
it'll be like going out of the country for me and

379
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,940
So, I don't know that'll be fun

380
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,620
Have fun with that humidity on the East Coast

381
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,300
That's the first thing you'll notice when you visit the East Coast humidity at least that for me

382
00:29:26,420 --> 00:29:28,700
Okay, you step off the plane you go. She's

383
00:29:29,460 --> 00:29:33,500
Yeah, well just like I'm sure when people from the East Coast come to hear they go she's

384
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Jeez! What's wrong with you people? How can you live here? I can't breathe!

385
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I think for most it's a relief.

386
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,500
Yeah, and the people from the Midwest just go sheesh anyways.

387
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:46,500
Anyway.

388
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:50,500
But yeah, today I was bored and slept all day and then got up and I'm like,

389
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,500
oh, we caught a Murray Little Walmart.

390
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Ha!

391
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:57,500
Yeah. I had to be a dork, and even though I already have the Japanese version,

392
00:29:57,500 --> 00:30:02,500
I went and bought the English version on Friday just so I could enjoy the king's English humor.

393
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:06,260
And then, notice quite a few changes between the Japanese and American versions, like,

394
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:10,220
a lot of them just really superficial changes, some of them really dumb, but whatever.

395
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:15,620
But yeah, that was my day and week, I guess.

396
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:16,620
Any other game?

397
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:17,620
Huh?

398
00:30:17,620 --> 00:30:18,620
Logi, yes.

399
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,300
What the hell was up with the manual?

400
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,500
I looked at that and I'm like, what the hell is this?

401
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:27,700
Because the screenshots, you made it kind of look like they were painted with watercolors,

402
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,740
and I hope that's not what the game looks like.

403
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:30,740
No.

404
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Okay.

405
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:38,740
That's just the art director's style they do. A lot of the wallpapers and stuff they put up on the Japanese site, they look all weird like that.

406
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Some of them don't even look like they really have much to do with the game.

407
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:46,740
And when he draws the characters in that style, they look all super goofy and whatever.

408
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:56,740
My week and my day, I actually didn't do a whole lot, really. I've been pretty sad this week.

409
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:02,740
Just work. A lot, a lot of work. And because of that, a lot, a lot of napping after work, because work kind of drains me a lot.

410
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:09,740
So I didn't really go anywhere exciting or do anything that great. I really wish I had something to share, but I don't.

411
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:18,740
I went to Fry's yesterday, and I was just, you know, I bought the K game there, and I was actually, my friend's monitor just about blew up.

412
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,740
Apparently, like, it started shooting out blue sparks when he tried turning it on, which isn't a good thing.

413
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:27,740
So, yeah, Loki's going, yeah!

414
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:31,540
But we decided to go look at new monitors, and I kind of want a new monitor now, too,

415
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,360
although the one I have is really good, I can't complain.

416
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,780
I want a flat screen.

417
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,780
It was free.

418
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:42,540
I know it was, and that's why I can't complain about it, but I want a flat screen.

419
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,020
I want a little black flat screen.

420
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,020
I did the same thing.

421
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,020
I do have a black flat screen.

422
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,020
Exactly.

423
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:48,020
See?

424
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,020
It works a lot better.

425
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:50,020
See?

426
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:51,020
You know what I mean.

427
00:31:51,020 --> 00:31:52,020
And it'll be less heat, because it gets really hot in here during the show sometimes.

428
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:54,020
Let's kill a few of us, and that'll cut down on the heat.

429
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:54,520
Pow!

430
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Yeah, but I just, you know, that would help cut back on the heat,

431
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,020
and, you know, maybe getting a better fan for this behemoth computer down here.

432
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,020
I don't know if you can hear my fan. You probably can hear it over the air.

433
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:06,520
Let me see if I can...

434
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,020
You can't really hear it over the air, but it's...

435
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,020
I have a ginormously loud fan.

436
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:17,520
So, if I could get a better cooling thing in my computer, I bet it would be cooler in here, too.

437
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,520
So, those are just things I'm thinking about for the future.

438
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:24,160
So anyway, that was pretty much my week and day.

439
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:26,520
Oh, I played DDR when I was at Fry's.

440
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:29,160
They actually had the DDR Extreme set up.

441
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,480
Not Extreme 2, but DDR Extreme set up with the two pads.

442
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,320
And for soft pads that were taped to the ground,

443
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,760
I'm surprised that things held up.

444
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,240
I actually did a pretty decent job on the song I was playing.

445
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,800
So that was kind of fun.

446
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:45,020
So one last hurrah on DDR Extreme

447
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,480
before Extreme 2 comes out this week, which would be what?

448
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,120
Tuesday, Wednesday, I'll ask track.

449
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,980
What day is it gonna be on the shelves?

450
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:55,860
Wednesday? 27th. 27th will be on the shelf.

451
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:59,060
That's the ship day. Alright. Oh, Tuesday's the ship day?

452
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,700
I have no idea. I'm saying 27th. It'll be probably on shelves

453
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:06,140
to 27th, because that's what we have in our system as the street date,

454
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:09,740
which means when we get it. So that means that's probably when it's gonna arrive.

455
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:13,300
27th. Probably is 27th.

456
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:17,440
Sounds good. Although I know it's not gonna show up for a lot of stores until

457
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:27,440
I'm not in any huge rush. I know a lot of people are really excited about DDR Extreme 2 because Konami's really kept a lid on it this time.

458
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:34,440
There's still a lot, a lot of secrets people don't know about this game yet, including what the frickin' rest of the songs are outside the licenses.

459
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:35,440
What game?

460
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,440
DDR Extreme 2.

461
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
What game?

462
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,440
The dancing game with the arrow smash, like whack-a-mole, but with your feet. It's a cheesy eurobeat and stuff.

463
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:45,440
I thought you said they were keeping it under wraps, but nobody knew about it.

464
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,720
No, no, no. People know about the game. They just don't know anything about it. Shut up.

465
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:51,280
Unlock show?

466
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,040
Unlock show?

467
00:33:54,560 --> 00:34:00,720
I want to do one that I don't think we've got the setup to do it anymore. I know our mixing

468
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,160
board will take my PS2 inputs right there, but I don't know what to do for video. So I don't

469
00:34:08,160 --> 00:34:12,080
know if we can do an unlock show. Because my Commodore 64 monitor got stolen out of the back

470
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:17,480
in my car by some neighborhood brats, so I don't have anything to plug it into unless

471
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,400
we could find like a little TV somehow.

472
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,400
You might have one?

473
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,880
We might have to do that then, like Wednesday night.

474
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:24,880
We'll see.

475
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:25,880
To be continued.

476
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,880
To be continued.

477
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,960
Well, we'll see.

478
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
I'm still looking for...

479
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:34,000
I was looking at Best Buy today, but they didn't have any, like, VGA connectors, because

480
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm getting one for my Xbox 360 because I need something to, you know, be high def because

481
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:40,200
I don't...

482
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:41,200
I'm not going to have a high def TV.

483
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:48,200
I don't even know how the hell that's gonna work, because most of the games are in Hi-Def anyways, so if it's not in Hi-Def on your TV, what's that gonna look like?

484
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:49,200
I mean, it's all messed up?

485
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:57,200
No, I believe the regular Xbox, what it does is that if you want to play your games in widescreen, it will letterbox the games.

486
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:02,200
There's the menu you can go into and change the options, so it'll probably just letterbox your games.

487
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,200
So your video games will look like movies.

488
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,200
Yeah, but they're all, you know, Hi-Res and stuff, and my TV's not gonna support that.

489
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm sure they can filter the graphics down really quickly.

490
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:16,200
Well, anyways, I'm going to get a thing for my monitor, because it'll look pretty.

491
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:20,200
Then that way the fiance can watch her TV and I can play my games.

492
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:24,200
I remember the Dreamcast was really, really easy to hook up to a computer monitor.

493
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:28,200
That was the first system that really made it super easy, hooking up to a VGA monitor.

494
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:32,200
I think it kind of used that as a selling point, too.

495
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,200
Really? There ain't nothing wrong with that.

496
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:40,200
Good times.

497
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:44,200
I miss my Dreamcast. I'm going to get it out and dust it off. I didn't have that many games for it.

498
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:48,200
I mean, I just like PSO, but I think I had Typing of the Dead and

499
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Samba somewhere.

500
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,200
I'm talking about pirated games.

501
00:35:56,200 --> 00:36:00,200
We don't have to keep it a secret. We got Loki on here.

502
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:04,200
Like pirate games like Skies of Arcadia.

503
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,200
I didn't play any games this week, okay? Good job! Seven days without, aw, so proud of you for overcoming your decision.

504
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:15,200
That means that some chick's gonna climb out of his PSP monitor and steal a soul or something.

505
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:21,200
Did you speak like a pirate on Monday? No, because I think that's retarded.

506
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:25,200
Yarr, you be retarded!

507
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:32,200
Um, yeah, I want to get off the Dreamcast and play some 2-2 Rocket, because that was a game I really sucked at, so maybe I can get good at it now.

508
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:39,200
No, you know what I want to play? I want to play Power Stone, and I want to play Power Stone was Badass, and I want to play, um...

509
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,200
It's all about Power Stone 2.

510
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:47,200
No, there's another Dreamcast game I'm thinking of that I really want to play.

511
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,200
Space Channel 5.

512
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,200
Soul Calibur.

513
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,200
Soul Calibur.

514
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,200
The ultimate in Soul Calibur fun is playing with the fishing controller.

515
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:59,200
That's right, I've heard about that, playing with a fishing controller.

516
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,200
Because it's analog.

517
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:06,200
And of course, every time you hit it, you're hitting basically one of the buttons, so it's really fabulous.

518
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,200
Sounds rather athletic.

519
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:16,200
If you want to know what playing the Nintendo Revolution is going to be like, try playing Soul Calibur with a fishing controller.

520
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:20,200
Remind me to save that one for the podcast.

521
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:25,520
I've been doing that for a long time, the fishing controller thing.

522
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:31,200
I remember trying to play Soul Calibur with my Dreamcast DDR pad, and the only analog

523
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:32,920
button is the Konami logo.

524
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,920
Wow.

525
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:37,240
So you can't really move.

526
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:41,920
I remember, I don't remember whose house we did this at, it was either a Guana Girl's

527
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,920
house or your house.

528
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,120
Speaking of Project Justice, yeah.

529
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:48,600
But we played Bust a Move Groove on dance pads once.

530
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,600
I've done that.

531
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:55,520
fun. The second one you can do it really easily on. Damn them for not making another game.

532
00:37:55,520 --> 00:38:00,480
All you do is put it in whatever the easy one was, which is all arrows, and you can

533
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:05,040
play it. Damn them for not making another one. Seriously. Well, they did Dance Summit.

534
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,600
I know, but Dance Summit doesn't count because they didn't release it here, and also, with

535
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:13,460
the Dance Game craze being the way that it is, I can't believe that Squeenix, since they

536
00:38:13,460 --> 00:38:19,200
absorbed, you know, annex. I can't believe that they haven't done another one. They could

537
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:24,160
do Final Fantasy dance. No, I'm kidding. They shouldn't do that. Um, but they could do something

538
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:30,160
cute. You know they could. Stop doing the roleplaying. You know, they just need to put

539
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:35,680
the whole Avix side, you know, get Avix back and do a whole new one. Seriously. You know,

540
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:39,980
a friend of mine once had an interesting perspective. I don't know if you guys know about this,

541
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:45,140
But way back when they beta tested or location tested DER 4th Mix.

542
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:48,380
I don't know if it was location test or an early build of the game or what, but there

543
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:53,620
was actually a song from the Dance Maniac series Eyes On Me.

544
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:58,100
And of course that's the theme song from Final Fantasy 8, but it was a dance mix of it that

545
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,580
appeared on one of the Dance Maniac's albums.

546
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,300
I want to say like X5 or something.

547
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:08,540
I know there was one on Zip Mania, but I think it was the version pulled from like X5 or

548
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
something.

549
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:12,780
Konami was supposed to be in DDR4thMix, well it got pulled at the last minute and the rumor

550
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:17,540
was that Square took issue with it, so they just pulled the song.

551
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,740
But my friend kind of at the time was like, well you know, Square probably does that because

552
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:27,900
if they wanted to do a DDR style game with all their music, they could totally do it.

553
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,380
I mean imagine like a DDR style game with all Square music, like Chocobo Dance Party.

554
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:35,380
They could do it!

555
00:39:35,380 --> 00:39:36,380
They could totally do it!

556
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:39,500
That would be a really good idea until Konami sues them.

557
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:45,820
Not if it's a different style game, like Final Revolution.

558
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:50,140
And you know, there was actually, because I have this game on Dreamcast, being the big

559
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:53,300
Puyo Puyo nerd I am, I have Puyo Da.

560
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:58,060
I remember you showing that to me once, and there's other style dance games Konami's not

561
00:39:58,060 --> 00:40:02,740
going to sue them over, like you know, Bust-a-Groove-Move and Puyo and

562
00:40:02,740 --> 00:40:09,480
Well, Puyo Da was more like Bust-a-Move except you built up your combos, and it worked sort

563
00:40:09,480 --> 00:40:16,200
sort of how you would do your drop on the other person by having a better combo than

564
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:20,040
they did, and you would cancel out each other's combos, sort of like when you're playing P.O.P.O.

565
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:25,480
It brought in a different innovation to it, as opposed to just the repetition, so that

566
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,960
I think is where they were unique.

567
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:32,120
Didn't one of the Final Fantasies have like a little DDR mini-game in it, or something

568
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:37,160
where you hit the buttons, not with beatmania, where you hit the buttons and tune with the

569
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,160
music?

570
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:44,580
Rival Schools game that they came out with in Japan, which was the Evolution one, had

571
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:50,240
a sort of like Batsu Breakdancing in it, had a DDR sort of mode in it, more like a you

572
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,240
enter and the commands sort of like bust a move.

573
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:53,240
And Grand Theft Auto had that.

574
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:59,360
And, um, Card Fighter Clash, not Card Fighter Clash, um, the other, um, Marvel Capcom, not

575
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:10,760
Marvel Capcom, SNK Capcom on the Neo Geo, had pretty much DDR in it, so.

576
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,680
I think that, you know, there's an old-ass game, and I only know this game because it

577
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,240
was my first DDR game I ever owned.

578
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,640
It wasn't really DDR, it was my first dance game I ever owned.

579
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:24,880
It was the Jungle Book dancing game for the PlayStation.

580
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:25,880
I remember that.

581
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,440
I remember showing you Third Mix.

582
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,520
I remember the dance pad was like half the size of a normal dance pad because they make

583
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,920
it for four year olds, but here I am playing on this Jungle Book dance pad, and it actually

584
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:41,760
had a whole little game that went with it, and the arrows were in like little bubbles

585
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:46,040
and you know it was very similar, very very similar to DER, except I think it went, scrolled

586
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:49,820
down, but whatever, but you know and all the music was from the Jungle Book, you know,

587
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:55,240
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too, it had all the little music in it, and you

588
00:41:55,240 --> 00:42:25,200
You know that music game I can't believe they have not made a sequel to?

589
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,200
I'm kind of surprised too.

590
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,200
Why?

591
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,200
It was a great game.

592
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,200
Yeah.

593
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,200
They should do it.

594
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:37,920
It was pretty much all one band that did the music, and then they had an outside artist

595
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,320
come in and do all the graphics and the entire design for the game, so that may be a part

596
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:44,200
of the reason, but I don't know.

597
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:48,200
They just could find a new band and a new artist or whatever.

598
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,200
Okay.

599
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:50,200
Yeah.

600
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,200
Cool.

601
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,200
All right.

602
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,340
I guess we're going to go to a break, guys, and we're going to come back and talk about

603
00:42:54,340 --> 00:43:00,420
some more things going on in the DDR world, and in this break we're going to start playing

604
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:04,660
some tracks from the brand new UltraMix III V-Rare, which came out this week. In this

605
00:43:04,660 --> 00:43:11,100
break we're going to hear Nevaraka, who originally remixed the Day Behavior song Superstar in

606
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:14,940
UltraMix II. They have their own song, it's called Evolution. Now the interesting thing

607
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:19,940
about the UltraMix III V-Rare is that it has tracks from song packs on it. So this first

608
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:24,820
This track is actually from Song Pack 14, so go figure.

609
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:28,860
Akira Yamaoka with Love This Feeling has been remixed by Zonk.

610
00:43:28,860 --> 00:43:31,660
Zonk was the band that did Tittle Tattle in Ultra Mix 2,

611
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:34,860
so it's a very, I don't know how to explain it.

612
00:43:34,860 --> 00:43:37,100
It's a very kind of groovy version of Love This Feeling.

613
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,260
But the interesting thing is that,

614
00:43:38,260 --> 00:43:40,900
and they've kind of been picking at this on the DER Freak forums,

615
00:43:40,900 --> 00:43:45,140
is that instead of remixing the Chang Ma version,

616
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:47,980
it really sounds like they went back and remixed the Akira Yamaoka one

617
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:51,380
guitar freaks and drum mania love this feeling so that's kind of cool so it's a

618
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:55,860
good remix and then we're gonna hear togo featuring sauna with jelly kiss but

619
00:43:55,860 --> 00:43:59,380
it's MIDI heads version the MIDI head smack mix and then the last track we're

620
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:04,500
gonna hear this break is Chantanix with hash the Sun brand new song we're gonna

621
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:08,820
have in DDR Ultramix 3 so we'll be back after this with more orange lounge radio

622
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:10,820
Enjoy!

623
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:45,820
Evolution

624
00:44:45,820 --> 00:44:52,820
Evolution

625
00:44:52,820 --> 00:45:02,820
Evolution

626
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:17,340
Bugging down the street now and those are me Thinking had a little kiss, waving at my

627
00:46:17,340 --> 00:46:20,340
My face watching out for neighbors bugging the old folks

628
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,340
Feels good to be home

629
00:46:22,340 --> 00:46:24,340
Love is breathing

630
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:26,340
Born with a plan to shift

631
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:27,340
You get the plan to get by

632
00:46:27,340 --> 00:46:29,340
Love is breathing

633
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:34,340
Moving your body

634
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:36,340
Born with a plan to shift

635
00:46:36,340 --> 00:46:37,340
You get the plan to get by

636
00:46:37,340 --> 00:46:39,340
Moving your body

637
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:43,340
The

638
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:47,340
The

639
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:51,340
The

640
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:55,340
The

641
00:49:55,340 --> 00:49:59,340
The

642
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:03,340
The

643
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:07,340
The

644
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:12,340
We have to get down, get down, we have to walk the walk. When we get down here now we have to walk the walk.

645
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:17,340
What are the next two people can do to lift the money up the next time in?

646
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:21,340
Just like what you have a Mr. Streep next hand, I'll put him on top of me and he'll jump on top.

647
00:50:21,340 --> 00:50:37,340
Is there anything we can buy so we can get any pictures of all the wires?

648
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,340
Woo!

649
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:26,100
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

650
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:32,740
You know what else Captain Jack told me?

651
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:34,020
Copy kills music.

652
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:35,420
It does.

653
00:51:35,420 --> 00:51:37,260
You're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

654
00:51:37,260 --> 00:51:42,360
we're giving away free stuff, the drawing's only probably about an hour away, so make

655
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:46,760
sure you get your emails in, freestuff at orangelandtrader.com, and answer some questions

656
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:50,960
from before, you don't have to put your address in the email, but if you put it in there,

657
00:51:50,960 --> 00:51:54,240
we're not gonna disqualify you or anything, but if you send us two emails, you are gonna

658
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,780
get disqualified, so send those in freestuff at orangelandtrader.com, and what is the free

659
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:02,640
stuff we're giving away tonight? Well, if you win, and we'll have one listener during

660
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:07,840
the live show tonight and one winner sometime this week after the podcast, you are going

661
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,460
to win a pair of CDs, one of them being the DDR Max 2 V-Rare, which is kind of hard to

662
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:17,560
find now, and the DDR EX2 V-Rare, which if you didn't pre-order the game, you ain't going

663
00:52:17,560 --> 00:52:21,680
to get anywhere else. So we're going to hook you up with those. So if you want to copy

664
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:27,480
authentic copies, sealed copies of DDR Max 2 and DDR EX2, and who knows, we might just

665
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:32,600
because we're loving and caring hosts, we might throw something else in the bag too

666
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:36,520
too. But the one thing we will not be throwing in the bag will be a copy of In the Groove

667
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:44,160
as defaced by Loki, Dark Sakura, and I will be a lot more forgiving for In the Groove.

668
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,280
I'm not going to deface it, but I will definitely do my part.

669
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,560
You're not going to throw $5 bills in with the viewers?

670
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,920
No, no money. No money, because I don't have money, and I don't know about Dark Sakura

671
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:58,960
and Loki, but even if I had money, I wouldn't give it to our listeners. No offense. Love

672
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,960
you guys, but damn.

673
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:01,960
We're cheap.

674
00:53:01,960 --> 00:53:07,960
The screen is expensive and the cast is cheap.

675
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:14,960
By the way, my opinion of the songs in the break, 100% differs from yours.

676
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:19,000
I was going to just get to that, and that is the songs that we played in the break from

677
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,440
the UltraMix 3 VRayer, Dark Sakura, I know you weren't too thrilled with a couple of

678
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:24,440
those.

679
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:28,140
That version of Love That Feelin' was crap disguised as a song.

680
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:29,140
You know what's interesting?

681
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,440
It's a very polarized reaction on DDRFreak.

682
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:33,760
I was reading on the forums over there a very polarized reaction.

683
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:37,080
Some people love it, and some people just think it is poop.

684
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,000
And I also don't like that version of Jelly Kiss either.

685
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,280
Oh, I really like the Jelly Kiss ones.

686
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,680
I'm not that big on the Love This Feelin' mix.

687
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:46,080
I like Zonk, but...

688
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,160
And the first one was very generic.

689
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:51,580
Like photocopy generic.

690
00:53:51,580 --> 00:53:53,080
The ferret is being requested.

691
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,480
The ferret is being requested?

692
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,480
The ferret is being requested.

693
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:59,040
Alright, we'll get out the ferret and take care of that request.

694
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:12,240
We'll look for the ferret and try to get the ferret in on the show a little later.

695
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:15,840
Hell if I know where those things went off to.

696
00:54:15,840 --> 00:54:18,800
We'll keep looking for it during the next break and try to get an appearance by the

697
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:19,800
ferret.

698
00:54:19,800 --> 00:54:21,320
Oh, you know what reminds me, though?

699
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:22,320
You know sometimes I...

700
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:23,320
What do ferrets remind you of?

701
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:27,460
No, I look out there on the internet sometimes because I like to do ego searches.

702
00:54:27,460 --> 00:54:28,680
You know what an ego search is?

703
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:32,920
an ego search is when you go to Google and you type in your name and you see what sites

704
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:36,740
come up. Well, I actually went to Google and typed in Orange Lounge Radio and I do that

705
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:40,680
once in a while to see, you know, what the dirt is out there on the internet. And the

706
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:46,240
weird thing is, is that there's a site out there that links to us as a news source. Like

707
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:53,880
they have all these RSS feeds and we're one of them as a news source and the site is ferretmarketing.com

708
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,960
Look, if you guys don't believe me, look at this, right here in the studio.

709
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:02,000
In fact, I'll even post this in chat.

710
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,720
This poor site is going to get hammered, but I don't care.

711
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,320
I'm going to post this in chat.

712
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:08,320
Check this out.

713
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,320
Ferret Marketing.

714
00:55:09,320 --> 00:55:10,320
And here we are.

715
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:13,200
Here is the URL for the awesome new source, orangelaunchradio.com, and it shows like our

716
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,020
latest headlines.

717
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:18,920
Why we are on ferretmarketing.com, I have no idea.

718
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Because you mentioned ferrets.

719
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:23,000
There's a ferret fan that's listening to this show that must-

720
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,240
pretty damn cute ferrets. They are cute ferrets that are on the page.

721
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:29,400
I have no idea what the... I know, we'll look for it.

722
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:33,880
It might, it might be in a, there's probably some in a box over there, so I'll dig through them on the next break.

723
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:39,240
Anyway, Loki's currently defacing the copy of In the Groove that we're going to give away.

724
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:43,160
And I'm helping. What have you done? I assure you, wait, what did you write on the manual here?

725
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:46,480
I assure you this is not DDR, okay?

726
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:50,400
What did you write on the cover there? I want to see what Loki wrote on the cover there,

727
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:55,640
In the groove there this game sucks monkey balls and then signed it by Loki. That was very polite

728
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:59,880
All right, I found a book called 500 things my ferret told me

729
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,400
Let me guess

730
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,200
And

731
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:15,200
If you are an in the groove fan listening to this program and getting pissed off

732
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,800
It's just a game. It's just a game people. It's just a game

733
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:25,800
We have the right to our opinion. I don't think it sucks, but I do, I look forward to new DDR mixes more than I do in the game.

734
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,800
I had people go, why are you ruining such a perfect, that's stupid, and I'm like, because I can.

735
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:32,800
Exactly, so if you-

736
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:39,800
If I was given a free iPod, I'd probably break it, but then if I didn't break it, I would give it away and do the exact same thing.

737
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:46,800
Okay, so if you're wondering why are you bastards writing all over a copy of a degree and giving away-

738
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:52,800
I personally bought this copy, okay, so my money was spent on this copy that I am sending out.

739
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:58,800
So if it makes you feel better, In The Groove fans, Loki spent money, so he's essentially supporting In The Groove.

740
00:56:58,800 --> 00:57:04,800
But because he doesn't like it, he's turning it over to an In The Groove fan. And what better charity than that, huh?

741
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,800
So stop bitching.

742
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:13,800
We will get some pics of the defaced In The Groove. Probably not by the end of the show, but a little later on in the program.

743
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:17,480
All right, a little later on in the week.

744
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,320
What were the ferrets called?

745
00:57:19,320 --> 00:57:19,820
Lokies?

746
00:57:19,820 --> 00:57:20,840
One of our chatters, I think, is that.

747
00:57:20,840 --> 00:57:22,000
The Skoozies.

748
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:23,680
But I don't remember exactly how it's spelled,

749
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,260
because it's bringing up other companies.

750
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:27,800
It's like S-C-O-O-Z-I-E-S.

751
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,560
It came up with something completely different.

752
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,160
I can hold on.

753
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:30,760
I can find it.

754
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:33,520
They have a whole website and a mini web game they can play.

755
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:34,680
Was it adult-oriented?

756
00:57:34,680 --> 00:57:37,240
Because I bet Skoozies would be a pretty X-rated term

757
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:39,240
for some genitalia, if you think about it.

758
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:51,140
Show them your scoozy. You mean, what was it, S-E-Z-Y? Scuzzy. No, scuzzy is a little

759
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:56,240
different there. Let's see, so moving on, I want to talk about some other things. Some

760
00:57:56,240 --> 00:58:00,320
things that people were talking about before the show, and I actually can't say I'm really

761
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:03,460
up to date on what's going on here, so I'm hoping somebody might call in the Skype line

762
00:58:03,460 --> 00:58:07,660
later and clear up the air on what's going on, but I guess there's going to be some type

763
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:18,540
of DDR thing on MTV. Not just any MTV, but MTV2. MTV2, of course. I remember when MTV2

764
00:58:18,540 --> 00:58:22,280
first launched, it was supposed to be, oh, since MTV, we're freely admitting is not a

765
00:58:22,280 --> 00:58:26,100
music-oriented station anymore, MTV2 is where we're going to play all the videos.

766
00:58:26,100 --> 00:58:30,940
It's where MTV goes to die. Basically. But guess what? Now, on MTV2,

767
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,580
they don't just play videos anymore. They play other crap. They play old episodes of

768
00:58:33,580 --> 00:58:41,580
real world stuff. So, one of our listeners, Sephiroth1215 on our web forums actually wrote,

769
00:58:41,580 --> 00:58:46,260
I was randomly watching that video mod show yesterday and they showed a preview for the

770
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:52,540
new episode that will be on Friday. This preview mentioned DDR being featured for a video.

771
00:58:52,540 --> 00:58:55,620
I think it's about time they did this, it only seems to make sense. Perfect for the

772
00:58:55,620 --> 00:59:01,100
time for the new release, I guess. Other than an Everything But The Girl video? Yeah, if

773
00:59:01,100 --> 00:59:07,480
actually have seen if you played 2DX third style and played five fathoms you

774
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:13,760
can actually see an old-ass version of DDR like butterfly old-ass version of

775
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:17,640
DDR in the video and you can see a five key like they're playing Jam Jam Reggae

776
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:27,380
on the video or something so it's kind of cute what do you guys think MTV going

777
00:59:27,380 --> 00:59:32,720
to be on, uh, or DDR is going to be on MTV. Good thing for the community, bad thing for

778
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:35,040
the community. I don't give a shit. What do you think?

779
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:40,380
That means DDR has jumped the shark. DDR has officially jumped the shark? So does this

780
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:45,640
mean you're an In The Groove fan now? Fuck no. Okay, if the originals jumped the shark,

781
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:53,040
why would I go for a pale imitation? How about dance praise? Does that jump the shark? It

782
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:55,040
It is the shark.

783
00:59:55,040 --> 00:59:56,640
Bugged.

784
00:59:56,640 --> 00:59:57,640
Your thoughts.

785
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,640
DDR on MTV.

786
00:59:58,640 --> 00:59:59,640
Good thing, bad thing.

787
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:00,640
I don't give a shit.

788
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:01,640
Don't give a shit.

789
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:02,640
It's on MTV, too.

790
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,840
I don't even get MTV fucking, too.

791
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:09,200
Garrett, a pop music horror.

792
01:00:09,200 --> 01:00:10,520
DDR on MTV.

793
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:15,240
Don't give a shit.

794
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:16,720
I guess it's a good thing.

795
01:00:16,720 --> 01:00:18,500
I think it's a good thing.

796
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:25,360
exposure for DDR despite how we might you know think MTV 2 is just stupid more

797
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:30,040
exposure for DDR means more copies of the game get sold means we get an EX 3

798
01:00:30,040 --> 01:00:36,200
next year right so I say it's a good thing any exposure is a good thing if

799
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:43,000
more people buy copies of it somebody in the chat room is saying I would love to

800
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:49,520
to see In the Groove on MTV. And I have to say, when I was at E3, we were actually downstairs

801
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:53,360
in Kenshia Hall, where Red Octane had a booth, and they had In the Groove set up. They didn't

802
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:58,120
have it even set up the first day, but I think this was the last day of the show. Myself,

803
01:00:58,120 --> 01:01:01,520
and I don't know if you guys remember from the old Wednesday show, Rice Princess and

804
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:08,440
Lanky Style, we were down there in Kenshia Hall, and we were at the In the Groove showing,

805
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:12,680
And MTV came by and filmed this guy very randomly playing.

806
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:16,480
Thank you for pulling out my Dreamcast out of a box.

807
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,720
MTV came by and was very randomly filming somebody

808
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:20,640
playing in the groove.

809
01:01:20,640 --> 01:01:24,000
But it was for like an MTV.com series.

810
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:25,420
But what I thought was interesting

811
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:28,560
is that one of the hosts was Chilon Liu and then

812
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:30,160
some guy from Road Rules.

813
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:34,600
But Chilon was, you remember right before the screen savers

814
01:01:34,600 --> 01:01:36,640
went kaput and changed into Attack of the Show,

815
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:37,720
they had Chilon on there.

816
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:42,580
she was kind of now if you really want to see if you want to really see what a

817
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:48,580
giggling girl is it's Chilon I mean it would and you know I know that sometimes

818
01:01:48,580 --> 01:01:58,000
that that phrase is overused but in her case it really was true so but she's

819
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:04,660
still doing things for MTV it looks like so interesting so they were doing in the

820
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:09,660
So in some way it would have been on MTV, I suppose.

821
01:02:09,660 --> 01:02:13,660
So of course, EX2 is coming out this week. I'm curious what you guys think.

822
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:16,660
Are you guys ready to pick this game up, or do you not care?

823
01:02:16,660 --> 01:02:20,660
Are you done with DDR home mixes? What do you think?

824
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:25,660
I'm curious to hear from you, Garrett, because you are mostly an import gaming horn.

825
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,660
You don't buy a whole lot of the US games, do you? I don't think you really do.

826
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:33,660
Not as many as I watch. I don't buy a whole lot of games, period, anymore.

827
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:34,780
I don't know what it is.

828
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:41,580
But I lost interest of the US DDRs after Max 1 or 2.

829
01:02:41,580 --> 01:02:44,820
For the US, it's just the song that's just regurgitated

830
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:50,140
from random transplants with crappy steps or songs that I

831
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:51,260
already had in other versions.

832
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,300
I'm like, no, it's kind of pointless.

833
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:56,040
UltraMix stuff looked interesting, but I don't care

834
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,500
to get an Xbox.

835
01:02:57,500 --> 01:03:00,300
So there's my feelings on that.

836
01:03:00,300 --> 01:03:02,780
So you're probably not going to buy EX2?

837
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:05,380
No, the down arrow on my red Octane pad is broken.

838
01:03:05,380 --> 01:03:05,880
Dope.

839
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:07,780
Alright.

840
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,680
Loki, I'm kind of curious, what are your thoughts about EX-2?

841
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:13,380
I'm probably getting it free, so I don't care.

842
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,580
But are you excited about it? Could you care less? What is it?

843
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:19,280
I don't really have working pads, so, I mean...

844
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:24,980
Well, I have working pads, I just haven't, you know, gotten them so that they're not, you know, breaking all the time.

845
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:25,780
But, um...

846
01:03:25,780 --> 01:03:32,780
Yeah, I guess it's cool. I mean, I don't play DDR really right now, other than, you know, just StepMania stuff.

847
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:37,780
I'm really... The setup they have in the house right now is not conducive to DDR, so...

848
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:39,780
Unfortunately.

849
01:03:39,780 --> 01:03:43,780
But yeah, it's cool. I mean, I can't wait to see what else they've got on there.

850
01:03:43,780 --> 01:03:49,780
Like, all the new songs and remixes and fun stuff that they have, and thank God they haven't spoiled it yet, so...

851
01:03:49,780 --> 01:03:51,780
It'll be good.

852
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:55,780
I didn't like the fact that they had hints last time, so.

853
01:03:55,780 --> 01:04:00,780
Dr. Sakra, I'm kind of curious about your thoughts about EX2, because you started DDR

854
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:05,780
way back in the day, so you've seen this game really change, as have really all of us, but

855
01:04:05,780 --> 01:04:07,780
I know you've been on board for a long time.

856
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:12,780
I think I'm going to get it, just because I'm also planning on finally throwing down

857
01:04:12,780 --> 01:04:16,780
a little bit of money and getting an ignition pad because I want to play at home some more.

858
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:23,780
But, other than that, I'm not too excited about it, and the music isn't all that exciting

859
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,780
anymore.

860
01:04:24,780 --> 01:04:30,660
And, you know, if I get something other than recycled, you know, puked trance, it's the

861
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:35,380
only way I can describe it, like someone took generic trance, put it on a photocopier, and

862
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:38,700
said, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song, here's a new song.

863
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:44,700
I want a DDR with good music, with real music in it.

864
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:50,840
I mean, I love all the Konami originals, all those are great, but if you're going to bring

865
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:53,480
in something new, bring in something innovative.

866
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:57,080
Throw us a freaking bone here, what kind of stuff, what kind of music would make you happy?

867
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:58,080
Blur.

868
01:04:58,080 --> 01:04:59,080
I mean...

869
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,080
Oh, I see.

870
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:02,800
You want Feel Good Inc. in DDR.

871
01:05:02,800 --> 01:05:03,800
That's not Blur, that's Gorillaz.

872
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,880
Well, I know, but still.

873
01:05:05,880 --> 01:05:09,320
But I do want something that's got more substance to it.

874
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:17,740
other than that you know just not all music you can dance to is is the techno

875
01:05:17,740 --> 01:05:21,700
stuff out of curiosity how do you feel about like the unleashed and dancing

876
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:26,120
stage games the Europe ones that have the British Brit pop songs in them and

877
01:05:26,120 --> 01:05:31,320
stuff that makes me happy I mean I don't really care about like the

878
01:05:31,320 --> 01:05:36,220
uber pop but just that it's it's trying it seems like it's trying to cater more

879
01:05:36,220 --> 01:05:45,780
toward a broader scope of music, I think, you know, trying to... I need to just make

880
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:47,380
my own DDR mix.

881
01:05:47,380 --> 01:05:53,940
I think a lot of folks in America, even if you're a fan of the American DDRs, even if

882
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:59,060
you're a fan of the Japanese home DDR mixes, almost everybody agrees that the British folks

883
01:05:59,060 --> 01:06:02,620
get really good songs. They get really good mixes.

884
01:06:02,620 --> 01:06:12,000
There's actually an interesting thread on a DDR Freak, because I mod the UK forum, talking

885
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,380
about which one would you more prefer has been a discussion in this one thread.

886
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:20,720
I'll try to hunt it down and get more info out of it, but it was really kind of interesting

887
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:29,680
seeing who would want what out of what mix, and seeing that there was sort of on the other

888
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:35,680
side that they want some of what we get but I don't see why some of what we get

889
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:39,560
kind of cool though we get so we've got I honestly thought that the last release

890
01:06:39,560 --> 01:06:45,360
was so much better you know with a skulk and no Ultramix to Ultramix oh and I

891
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:48,200
think Ultramix 3 is gonna be pretty good too I mean I know you didn't like those

892
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:51,400
particular songs but if you remember the Ultramix one v-rare it didn't have a

893
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:58,000
whole lot of what the game really had in store so we'll see but I I haven't heard

894
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,600
anything that's excited me yet. In fact, just what we played in the

895
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:07,440
break, the last break, really made me sad. Well, we're about to get to another break

896
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:10,360
pretty soon here. We're gonna hear four more songs. One of them is a classical

897
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,240
remix. I don't know if you'll dig that or not. We'll see. We're gonna get to that. In

898
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:17,600
fact, I think we'll get to it right now. How's that sound? Yay! Alright, then when

899
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,360
we come back, we're gonna do the Skype line. Siggy's gonna call in and he's

900
01:07:22,360 --> 01:07:27,640
gonna talk about a brand new Konami related CD that came out this week. So

901
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,280
we're gonna talk about that and at least I think it was this week I think so if

902
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:36,400
not he'll correct me on it I'm sure and some more stuff when we come back we'll

903
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:40,180
do the cage match sometime during this next segment as well and the rest of your

904
01:07:40,180 --> 01:07:44,960
calls on the skype line when we come back after this so in this break let's

905
01:07:44,960 --> 01:07:52,120
see what songs we're gonna hear here we're gonna do starting it off Moshek

906
01:07:52,120 --> 01:07:55,500
with moment 40 will be the first song that we hear and I believe this is the

907
01:07:55,500 --> 01:08:00,180
one that's a bit of a classical song remix so we'll hear that DJ Taka colors

908
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:03,620
but remixed by Midihead so that should be interesting

909
01:08:03,620 --> 01:08:09,260
John D and Spesh have done a version of Bylalakia carried with the wind and

910
01:08:09,260 --> 01:08:13,420
it's very interesting you might remember Johnny and Spesh did the max 300 remix

911
01:08:13,420 --> 01:08:17,500
from Ultramix 2 so that'll definitely be very interesting to hear and then we're

912
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:23,540
gonna hear Big Idea with Dansa De Juca and Big Idea is the one that did Byla

913
01:08:23,540 --> 01:08:28,740
LaSamba and ToeJam, which made its way into 2DX, Happy Sky.

914
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:31,460
I can't think of ToeJam without thinking of ToeJam and Arl.

915
01:08:31,460 --> 01:08:32,460
I know, I know.

916
01:08:32,460 --> 01:08:33,460
Yeah, me neither.

917
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:36,060
It's just because you're a Sega whore, and so are you, and that's okay, because Sega's

918
01:08:36,060 --> 01:08:37,100
a good thing.

919
01:08:37,100 --> 01:08:40,300
I can reach behind me and pull Segas out of my, out of your closet.

920
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:41,300
I know, I know.

921
01:08:41,300 --> 01:08:43,660
I keep all my Segas in the closet.

922
01:08:43,660 --> 01:08:46,460
They're trapped in the closet.

923
01:08:46,460 --> 01:08:47,460
We'll be back after this.

924
01:08:47,460 --> 01:08:54,460
off with Moshek Moment 40, UltraMix III V-Rare here tonight on Orange Laundry.

925
01:09:17,460 --> 01:09:45,460
He said fun, he said fun He said fun, he said fun

926
01:10:15,460 --> 01:10:38,740
Feeling blue, I'm thinking of you I'm almost a fool to let you walk away

927
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:44,740
Tears in my eyes today Make my world the color of blue

928
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:52,240
You, singing of you, I was a fool to let you walk away

929
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:58,740
Dancin' my accident with my girl, her father was a dick

930
01:10:58,740 --> 01:11:12,240
I'm a magic, a kiss, orange on the floor, yeah, green on tourmaline

931
01:11:12,240 --> 01:11:20,240
Yeah, no matter how low I love you, baby, I'm mild

932
01:11:20,240 --> 01:11:25,240
I'm covered in colors with sun

933
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:31,240
Only one, but baby, I'm loved

934
01:11:31,240 --> 01:11:36,240
I'm loved without you

935
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:43,020
I'll cry like a fire in the moon

936
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:50,220
I'll fall alone without you

937
01:11:50,220 --> 01:11:56,740
I'll cry alone

938
01:11:56,740 --> 01:11:59,540
I'm thinking of you, I'm thinking of you

939
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:04,340
Oh, I won't, won't, I'll let you go away

940
01:12:04,340 --> 01:12:10,340
The tears in my eyes today make my world the color of blue

941
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:13,340
Ooh, ooh, I'm thinking of you

942
01:12:13,340 --> 01:12:18,340
But I was a fool to let you walk away

943
01:12:18,340 --> 01:12:26,740
Here's the fire I could aim at my world, the color of blue

944
01:12:48,340 --> 01:13:08,340
I'm waiting for him before you say all the things you might have done in your life

945
01:13:08,340 --> 01:13:12,340
And I say, please, let me help you

946
01:13:12,340 --> 01:13:17,340
Yes, I know, oh, I know

947
01:13:47,340 --> 01:13:51,340
If you're me, you're supposed to see

948
01:13:51,340 --> 01:13:57,340
You will never go back again

949
01:15:51,340 --> 01:16:13,940
Whoop, dead air there, sorry guys.

950
01:16:13,940 --> 01:16:19,740
We forgot to put a little, I should say I forgot to put a little sweeper coming back.

951
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:24,660
So I was too busy doing my own spin on defacing the copy of In the Groove here.

952
01:16:24,660 --> 01:16:26,700
I'm actually writing in the table of contents right now.

953
01:16:26,700 --> 01:16:30,220
I actually added something to the table of contents in the instruction manual.

954
01:16:30,220 --> 01:16:34,120
I put how to get sued on page 69, how to get sued.

955
01:16:34,120 --> 01:16:39,980
And now I'm putting contents, I'm writing next to contents, contents of my ass.

956
01:16:39,980 --> 01:16:41,780
I'm going to put contents of my ass.

957
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:44,940
I'm putting special, really crappy artwork in the inside cover.

958
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:45,740
Yes.

959
01:16:45,740 --> 01:16:49,260
So again, this is us defacing In the Groove

960
01:16:49,260 --> 01:16:55,320
because we can. And to whoever wins this, Dark Soccer is leaving a very special message

961
01:16:55,320 --> 01:17:01,340
and some artwork in there inside the art, like you have to, you would have to pull out

962
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:06,220
the insert to see it on the inside. So whoever wins this is really going to enjoy this. Speaking

963
01:17:06,220 --> 01:17:10,480
of winning things, here, look, I don't want this anymore. Speaking of winning things,

964
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:14,940
you this week, yeah, you guys need to sign it too. We're also going to have Bugd and

965
01:17:14,940 --> 01:17:19,100
garrett are popping music or leave their work on it

966
01:17:19,100 --> 01:17:23,340
but this week you can right now you can win uh... the e x to be rare and that

967
01:17:23,340 --> 01:17:24,740
the max to be rare

968
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:26,260
some folks getting in there

969
01:17:26,260 --> 01:17:30,300
uh... uh... in our contest so if you want to join in you only have a little

970
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,460
bit of time left

971
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,000
free stuff

972
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,440
at orange laundry dot com all you have to do is send us an email no trivia

973
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,000
question

974
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:39,080
praise for the show

975
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,880
we will not fill your email to spammers were not into that we just want to have

976
01:17:42,880 --> 01:17:47,240
a fair contest, very random, so just send an email and then we're going to pick a random

977
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:53,160
number and that message in the inbox is our winner. It's a very scientific process. So

978
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,440
DarkSakura is written in the insert. She actually drew a picture of Emi from DDR. She drew a

979
01:17:57,440 --> 01:17:58,440
picture.

980
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,040
They're really bad ones since I don't have a good pen.

981
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:06,680
It says, ITG makes Emi cry. And Emi is actually crying in the picture. And Caker Death, which

982
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,000
is kind of random, but she wrote Caker Death at the bottom.

983
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:11,080
And I wrote something else on here too.

984
01:18:11,080 --> 01:18:19,440
game smells like butt on the insert. Don't forget to actually sign it at some point.

985
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:24,000
And just so you know, you know, we're not all in the groove haters. I realize Ark Soccer

986
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:27,880
and Loki are in the groove haters. I actually wrote my defacing, the other thing I did,

987
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:33,380
I wrote under, on the title, it says in the groove, I put is okay. And then I drew a little

988
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:38,000
unemotional face. So I put in the groove is okay. Because that's how I feel. In the groove

989
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,000
is OK.

990
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,520
Now what we're going to do is get over to our Skype line.

991
01:18:45,520 --> 01:18:48,520
And if you are interested in calling in the Skype line,

992
01:18:48,520 --> 01:18:51,960
head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and

993
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:53,680
click on Interact With Us.

994
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:56,640
And you, too, can be on.

995
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:58,160
Neil, you don't count.

996
01:18:58,160 --> 01:19:00,000
Bugs, god damn you.

997
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:02,040
You, too, can be on Orange Lounge Radio.

998
01:19:02,040 --> 01:19:04,240
I actually wanted to pick up.

999
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:05,480
Neil, you're a bastard.

1000
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:06,440
I hate you.

1001
01:19:06,440 --> 01:19:07,520
All right.

1002
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:08,760
I'm just too quick, I'm sorry.

1003
01:19:08,760 --> 01:19:11,840
No, I intentionally am bringing this call to the front because I want to speak to this

1004
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:12,840
person.

1005
01:19:12,840 --> 01:19:13,840
Siggy, you there?

1006
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,840
Oh, shit.

1007
01:19:14,840 --> 01:19:17,760
Siggy, you there?

1008
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:18,760
Can you hear me?

1009
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:19,760
I didn't do it!

1010
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,760
Yeah, it's slow.

1011
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:22,400
Okay, it's very slow.

1012
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:23,400
Oh, that stinks.

1013
01:19:23,400 --> 01:19:25,400
So does I, Siggy.

1014
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:26,400
I know.

1015
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:27,840
Siggy, I'm going to try calling you.

1016
01:19:27,840 --> 01:19:28,840
I'm going to call again.

1017
01:19:28,840 --> 01:19:30,960
Okay, I'm going to call you.

1018
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,560
I hope you heard that, that I'm going to call him, see if we have a little better luck.

1019
01:19:34,560 --> 01:19:38,840
I need to turn off my pornography torrents.

1020
01:19:38,840 --> 01:19:40,280
That is an annoying ass ring.

1021
01:19:43,640 --> 01:19:44,400
Two ringy dings.

1022
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,000
The rest of you guys are trying to call in right now.

1023
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:47,640
Call back in a little bit, because we wanted to bring

1024
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:49,840
this call to the front, because he actually has a

1025
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,560
contribution to make to tonight's show.

1026
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:54,440
Not that the rest of you don't have contributions to make to

1027
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:57,760
tonight's show, but this is, you know, super important.

1028
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,080
Well, shit.

1029
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,680
It's just ringing and ringing and ringing.

1030
01:20:02,680 --> 01:20:03,600
OK.

1031
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:09,600
Ziggy's going to actually just restart his PC, so we're going to let him restart his PC, and we'll take another call in the meantime.

1032
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:11,600
Ziggy!

1033
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:13,600
Zaku.

1034
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:14,600
What's up, man?

1035
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:20,600
You lucked out. The other call, I had to drop it and push it back to later, because the connection's slow, so you get to be first tonight.

1036
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:22,600
Weee!

1037
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:23,600
What's on your mind?

1038
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:27,600
Well, let me see, DDR Extreme 2 coming out in two days, and...

1039
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:29,600
Did you enter the contest?

1040
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,600
Yeah, I entered the VRARE one.

1041
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:32,600
Good man.

1042
01:20:32,600 --> 01:20:38,600
And basically MTV2 hoarding the shit out of DDR Extreme 2 via video mods.

1043
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:42,600
Yeah, what is this video mod show now? I don't watch MTV2, so you gotta tell me.

1044
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:50,600
Basically, video mods is a show, an MTV2 show where they take video game characters and make them reenact music videos.

1045
01:20:50,600 --> 01:20:52,600
You know, from Main Street Music.

1046
01:20:52,600 --> 01:20:55,600
Oh fuck, it's that show that's gonna have DDR?

1047
01:20:55,600 --> 01:20:59,600
Yeah, the only one I've ever seen, that is The Sims dancing to Hey Ya.

1048
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:07,600
My best bet is that they're going to make all the DDR2 characters, Dance 2, Stompalls get busy,

1049
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:15,600
which is the only mainstream track that Joe Sixpack probably knows, and probably the rest of America knows.

1050
01:21:15,600 --> 01:21:21,600
Who else in America would know about My My My or Silence, for that matter?

1051
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:30,600
Now, Silence I could see, but what I remember from the Silence video, it wasn't really anything, all that, so I could see the Get Busy video.

1052
01:21:30,600 --> 01:21:36,600
It's gonna be Get Busy. I'm betting everything on it, without a shadow of a doubt. You know how MTV is.

1053
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,600
Well, it could be something from Extreme 1.

1054
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:41,600
No, they're gonna use Extreme 2.

1055
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:55,600
I can tell you right now, you know, that's the most recent game, you know, MTV's not stupid, they're going to whore out the game, I'm just, you know, we'll just have to wait till Friday to see MTV.

1056
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,600
Alright, we'll see. You want to make some money on that wager?

1057
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:00,600
I'm just kidding, I'm kidding.

1058
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:11,600
I am going to have an extra Max 2 v-rare after these contests, so maybe I should offer to send Zaku the Max 2 v-rare if I'm wrong.

1059
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,600
Nah, that would be too nice of me to do. Sorry, Zaku.

1060
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:27,600
Also, you already know by now that UltraMix 3 v-rare reveals a few songs that might be in the game, like 250 BPM, Looney Tunes, and the Medley.

1061
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:32,200
The medley that's at the end that has a bunch of remixes of songs that are going to be in song packs

1062
01:22:32,200 --> 01:22:35,900
Yes, it possibly does reveal songs that will be in the game

1063
01:22:35,900 --> 01:22:40,200
Again, it's not for sure, but typically, song packs every mix

1064
01:22:40,200 --> 01:22:46,500
This right there, this is kind of like retribution for the fact that info was leaked last year with Ultramix 2

1065
01:22:46,500 --> 01:22:52,600
So I guess Konami's trying to sneak in a few hints for those who know enough to realize them

1066
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:56,300
Possibly, I honestly think Love Me Do is a shoo-in

1067
01:22:56,300 --> 01:23:03,900
Because the folks at Konami know that we are big Kiriyama Okahores and all his songs do

1068
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:05,540
very well in the DDR games.

1069
01:23:05,540 --> 01:23:09,180
So he has to have something in extreme hope.

1070
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:14,340
Do the higher-ups of Konami really listen to the station?

1071
01:23:14,340 --> 01:23:21,340
Besides people who work as beta testers slash step-makers, I mean the ones above them.

1072
01:23:21,340 --> 01:23:27,340
They're the ones listening and trying to, you know, and trying to reflect, and pretty much take DDR into that form.

1073
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,340
Anything else on your mind tonight, Zaku?

1074
01:23:35,340 --> 01:23:39,340
GameStop and the other players are still showing BNA US as November 1st is the release date.

1075
01:23:40,340 --> 01:23:44,340
I can tell you that's a load of crap. I assure you it will not be November 1st.

1076
01:23:45,340 --> 01:23:48,340
I'm saying the same thing too right now. I don't know why they can't get into their...

1077
01:23:48,340 --> 01:23:53,340
What are you saying? Who needs to be schooled on this, Zaku?

1078
01:23:53,340 --> 01:23:58,340
Uh, EB. EB Games needs to be schooled.

1079
01:23:58,340 --> 01:24:01,340
EB Games needs to be schooled on the release date of BeatMania USA.

1080
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:03,340
They need to push it by a few months.

1081
01:24:03,340 --> 01:24:04,340
It's not coming up this year.

1082
01:24:04,340 --> 01:24:07,340
They need to push it, uh, four more months.

1083
01:24:07,340 --> 01:24:13,340
EB Games management, if you're listening, um, EB Games management, update your damn systems.

1084
01:24:13,340 --> 01:24:15,340
That game will not be out this year, I guarantee it.

1085
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:16,340
Mhm.

1086
01:24:16,340 --> 01:24:20,340
Ultramix and, uh, what was it, that stuff got put on?

1087
01:24:20,340 --> 01:24:28,340
Ultramix, DDREX3, er, EX3, EX2 will be out this year, and, uh, the Karaoke Party is gonna be out before the year's out, right?

1088
01:24:28,340 --> 01:24:30,340
Yeah, Karaoke Party got posted.

1089
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:32,340
That's my big deal.

1090
01:24:32,340 --> 01:24:38,340
Karaoke Party will definitely be out this year. Those will be Konami's big pushes for Christmas, and then next year they can start another game.

1091
01:24:38,340 --> 01:24:42,340
Plus, with your Xtreme 2, you know, you get to play Karaoke Party, a demo.

1092
01:24:42,340 --> 01:24:44,340
So really really

1093
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:49,280
No one told me this. All right. All right, and that's yes pretty much about it

1094
01:24:49,820 --> 01:24:56,500
Digital life Expo next month October 14th and 15th 16th. Don't remind me because I can't go I can't go

1095
01:24:56,500 --> 01:25:01,840
but if you can know that but I'm just giving I'm just I'm just plugging the damn thing because you know,

1096
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:08,600
There's people on the East Coast that would want to go so I might as well plug it and just get you know

1097
01:25:08,600 --> 01:25:12,080
So tell them the date so they don't forget it.

1098
01:25:12,080 --> 01:25:14,120
Zaku, one other quick question for you guys.

1099
01:25:14,120 --> 01:25:18,880
I heard, for you, I heard Miyamoto was in New York City today.

1100
01:25:18,880 --> 01:25:22,720
Miyamoto the creator of so many Nintendo fabulous games.

1101
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:23,720
Yeah.

1102
01:25:23,720 --> 01:25:24,720
Did you go check this out?

1103
01:25:24,720 --> 01:25:25,720
Right in your backyard?

1104
01:25:25,720 --> 01:25:31,800
Uh, I, I didn't notice that because you know, as I said, I'm like 30 miles away in college

1105
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:35,040
from, I'm 30 miles from the city, I'm 30 miles north of the city.

1106
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:36,800
Nothing to train won't get you to.

1107
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:40,800
Yeah, because, you know, I'm still waiting for that first paycheck for my new job.

1108
01:25:40,800 --> 01:25:41,800
Alright, alright.

1109
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,800
So, that's it.

1110
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:44,800
Well, maybe he'll be back.

1111
01:25:45,800 --> 01:25:46,800
Alright, alright.

1112
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:48,800
Alright, Zaku.

1113
01:25:48,800 --> 01:25:50,800
I'm letting you go so we can take other calls.

1114
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:51,800
Alright, man.

1115
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:52,800
Have a good one.

1116
01:25:52,800 --> 01:25:53,800
Peace.

1117
01:25:53,800 --> 01:25:54,800
Take care.

1118
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:55,800
Alright.

1119
01:25:56,800 --> 01:25:57,800
We're going to go to another call.

1120
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,800
I apologize to those of you guys that are also trying to get in,

1121
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,800
but I definitely, definitely want to get Siggy in here

1122
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:09,060
it was kind enough to get us some previews of a brand new Konami artist-related album

1123
01:26:09,060 --> 01:26:14,620
that was out this week, so I want to make sure he can get in here, and we're just going

1124
01:26:14,620 --> 01:26:18,500
to wait for him to call. Then we'll get to some more calls on the Skype line. Remember,

1125
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:22,720
if you want to call us on the Skype line, all you have to do is head on over to orangelaungeradio.com

1126
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,600
and click on interact with us. Now let's try this again. Siggy, you there?

1127
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:29,760
Yep, I'm here, Skye. Much better. How you doing, my friend?

1128
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:30,960
I'm doing fine.

1129
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,640
Can we hear him in studio okay?

1130
01:26:32,640 --> 01:26:33,080
Good?

1131
01:26:33,080 --> 01:26:33,360
Yeah.

1132
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,560
Okay, good.

1133
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,400
Segi, now I've been kind of keeping it a secret because I know you wanted to talk about it.

1134
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:39,440
What are we going to hear?

1135
01:26:39,440 --> 01:26:41,920
What are you going to let our listeners hear tonight?

1136
01:26:41,920 --> 01:26:49,920
As of September 16, 2005, Guitar Freak's drum radio artist Asaki released his debut album, Shin Kyoku.

1137
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:51,880
Cool.

1138
01:26:51,880 --> 01:26:58,840
So there are actually four new original tracks by Asaki, and the six of them are from a, you know,

1139
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:03,040
from Bimondi games like Guitar Fix Trip Media and Pop It Music.

1140
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:10,040
So we're going to play track number two, which is the first original song by Asaki.

1141
01:27:10,040 --> 01:27:15,720
It's a mid-tempo song with very heavy guitar riffs and such.

1142
01:27:15,720 --> 01:27:18,480
So here's Firefly Sotaru.

1143
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,040
We're just going to be playing clips of these songs, too.

1144
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,240
We're not going to play the whole thing, because they're like six-minute-long songs.

1145
01:27:21,240 --> 01:27:22,600
Yeah, just a minute-long clips, yeah.

1146
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:23,120
All right, here we go.

1147
01:27:23,120 --> 01:27:26,400
This is track two, one of the brand new Asaki songs.

1148
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:55,080
Now, see, I dug that one.

1149
01:27:55,080 --> 01:28:00,080
That should have been on the UltraMix 3 vrare. Wouldn't that be cool to have a song like that on UltraMix 3?

1150
01:28:00,080 --> 01:28:01,080
We'll see.

1151
01:28:01,080 --> 01:28:02,080
Yeah.

1152
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:03,080
Alright, what else are we going to hear?

1153
01:28:03,080 --> 01:28:06,080
Even though I don't play Xbox, yeah, I think so.

1154
01:28:06,080 --> 01:28:09,080
Still, still would be a good thing. Okay, then fine, EX2, whatever.

1155
01:28:09,080 --> 01:28:18,080
Alright. The second track, which is another second Asagi original, is a very soft piano ballad.

1156
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:28,080
It's a very, how should I say it, very slow, very soft, so here's the sound of Conveil since Yogo no Oto.

1157
01:28:28,080 --> 01:28:35,080
All right, here's track five. Yes, that's track five. I was looking for it. Here it is, piano ballad.

1158
01:28:58,080 --> 01:29:06,180
...

1159
01:29:06,180 --> 01:29:11,180
Now that would not be a good song for DDR.

1160
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:13,180
Definitely not.

1161
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:16,180
Maybe Keyboard Mania, like a one-face song on Keyboard Mania.

1162
01:29:16,180 --> 01:29:18,180
Alright, what else are we going to hear?

1163
01:29:18,180 --> 01:29:22,180
The third track is a track 9, a third new Asaki original,

1164
01:29:22,180 --> 01:29:26,180
which is kind of like a taken page out of Tsumina Gura Tokana's life.

1165
01:29:26,180 --> 01:29:33,000
wife and this is a this is the divine comedy which is you know a popular poem

1166
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,820
written by Adante Algeri aka Adante's Inferno so here it is

1167
01:29:36,820 --> 01:29:43,820
And this is where the album gets its name. This is the title track.

1168
01:30:06,820 --> 01:30:30,300
That's pretty cool.

1169
01:30:30,300 --> 01:30:31,300
I like that.

1170
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:32,300
Very diverse.

1171
01:30:32,300 --> 01:30:35,420
This seems like it would be a good just kind of chill out music playing in the background

1172
01:30:35,420 --> 01:30:38,420
while you're trying to study or something. This is good, I like this.

1173
01:30:38,420 --> 01:30:44,420
If you guys... That last one makes me think sort of of a post-gog to Malus Miser.

1174
01:30:44,420 --> 01:30:45,420
A little bit, a little bit.

1175
01:30:45,420 --> 01:30:48,420
Again, if you're just joining us, we're listening to tracks from the brand new

1176
01:30:48,420 --> 01:30:51,420
Asaki album, which was just released this week.

1177
01:30:51,420 --> 01:30:54,420
Siggy's with us, and what else are we going to hear tonight, Siggy?

1178
01:30:54,420 --> 01:30:58,420
Oh, I just forgot to mention that track nine was the longest Asaki song,

1179
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:00,420
which is about nine minutes long.

1180
01:31:00,420 --> 01:31:02,420
That was a behemoth of a song, yes it was.

1181
01:31:02,420 --> 01:31:07,420
I would expect any song that's going to have Dante's Inferno is going to be kind of long, so.

1182
01:31:07,420 --> 01:31:09,420
Okay, what else are we going to hear?

1183
01:31:09,420 --> 01:31:16,420
And this one's the last track, you know, the last Asaki original, which is the most ordinary Asaki song that I've ever heard.

1184
01:31:16,420 --> 01:31:19,420
It's with Bubble in the Clear Sky.

1185
01:31:19,420 --> 01:31:22,420
Alright.

1186
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:27,420
No one is going to have your eye, that's what it is, well

1187
01:31:27,420 --> 01:31:31,420
Ain't somebody who's hanging on to you

1188
01:32:01,420 --> 01:32:21,140
Let's hear, for those folks that may not recognize Asaki too much, what's one of these songs

1189
01:32:21,140 --> 01:32:24,740
that was actually in a previous Bemani game?

1190
01:32:24,740 --> 01:32:32,540
The very first Asaki song that he ever, that the Bemani series, he got released was Sanagi

1191
01:32:32,540 --> 01:32:35,820
from Guitarpix Romania, seventh mix, sixth mix.

1192
01:32:35,820 --> 01:32:39,260
All right, and yes, this one's in rotation on our station as well, so you've probably

1193
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:46,260
heard this song before, but it's a long mix, so here's a little clip of this one.

1194
01:33:09,260 --> 01:33:16,260
Alright, those are tracks from the brand new album by Asaki Shinkyoku, did I say that right?

1195
01:33:16,260 --> 01:33:17,260
Yeah.

1196
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:18,260
Cool.

1197
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:19,260
Shinkyoku.

1198
01:33:19,260 --> 01:33:20,260
Shinkyoku, hey I'm learning.

1199
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:26,060
Alright, so now if folks want to order this album, how can they pick it up, Siggy?

1200
01:33:26,060 --> 01:33:32,780
I haven't checked out some online retailers, but I think PlayStation should be starting

1201
01:33:32,780 --> 01:33:33,780
their orders.

1202
01:33:33,780 --> 01:33:35,780
CD Japan too, right?

1203
01:33:35,780 --> 01:33:36,780
No.

1204
01:33:36,780 --> 01:33:42,780
Garrett actually ordered this CD because he was actually happy to hear these preview tracks

1205
01:33:42,780 --> 01:33:45,780
because he hasn't gotten this CD yet, so where did you pick this up from?

1206
01:33:45,780 --> 01:33:50,780
I ordered mine from Playasia, but I thought Golly's...

1207
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,780
I don't know, did they change the release date on Golly's art book?

1208
01:33:53,780 --> 01:33:56,780
Because I thought it was supposed to come out on the same day, but it obviously changed

1209
01:33:56,780 --> 01:33:59,780
so I'm not getting it until October when Golly's book comes out.

1210
01:33:59,780 --> 01:34:02,780
So, oh well. I get to listen to it now.

1211
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:18,780
I'm just going to tell Garrett that the file that I sent to Sky, it has the pictures of the cover, the CD, the lyrics to it.

1212
01:34:18,780 --> 01:34:20,780
Yeah, I saw those.

1213
01:34:20,780 --> 01:34:22,780
Ah, okay.

1214
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:26,780
He was looking over my shoulder while I was browsing it, so.

1215
01:34:26,780 --> 01:34:31,220
All right. Well, thank you so much, Siggy, for sharing that with our listeners tonight.

1216
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:35,460
We appreciate you kind of keeping a pulse on what's going on abroad because I don't

1217
01:34:35,460 --> 01:34:36,460
sometimes.

1218
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:39,700
I don't blame you. I don't blame you.

1219
01:34:39,700 --> 01:34:43,080
I appreciate it. There's just too much. It gets overwhelming sometimes. And Garrett really

1220
01:34:43,080 --> 01:34:48,300
helps fill me in on a lot of that stuff because he, you know, can understand a lot of Japanese

1221
01:34:48,300 --> 01:34:51,820
and Jamie does too. And, you know, between the two of them, I get filled in on what's

1222
01:34:51,820 --> 01:34:59,500
going on but um yeah otherwise i'm lost i'm just i'm just a dumb whitey hey i don't blame

1223
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:04,140
your don't just don't blame your color just uh i know i know it's it's just a joke kids

Um, Edward is a poppin' whore, right?

1226
01:35:17,540 --> 01:35:18,540
Yeah.

1227
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,540
2DX bastard here, nice to meet you.

1228
01:35:21,540 --> 01:35:24,540
Oh no, I'm a 2DX bastard too. I'm a 2DX and poppin' bastard.

1229
01:35:24,540 --> 01:35:30,540
Well, Siggy insists that he is THE 2DX bastard, so you're gonna have to be like the 2DX wench.

1230
01:35:30,540 --> 01:35:32,540
Yeah, well I love keyboard mania!

1231
01:35:32,540 --> 01:35:33,540
I know, I wanna be a-

1232
01:35:33,540 --> 01:35:34,540
Screw y'all!

1233
01:35:34,540 --> 01:35:36,540
I'm a keyboard mania hussy.

1234
01:35:36,540 --> 01:35:38,540
No. No, no, no, no.

1235
01:35:38,540 --> 01:35:42,540
Alright, Siggy, thanks for calling in. We're gonna try and get to one more call, so I gotta let you go, okay?

1236
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:44,540
It's all about Stance, Stance, Stance!

1237
01:36:12,540 --> 01:36:15,980
Torrance my friend no I'm kidding I know I know you wouldn't do that during the

1238
01:36:15,980 --> 01:36:22,060
show all right so what's on your mind I was there at Nintendo World this morning

1239
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:30,720
you got to see Miyamoto today hell no no what happened okay this was the plan me

1240
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:35,420
and my crew is gonna go down there at 7 a.m. and relax and get on the line one

1241
01:36:35,420 --> 01:36:39,500
of my friends that go down there 10 o'clock Saturday night and check it out

1242
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:47,500
I said, I'll go down to 10. If I see a line, I'm grabbing my bags and I'm going, I never left. I did not think it was going to be that packed.

1243
01:36:48,500 --> 01:36:50,500
Wow. It was crazy.

1244
01:36:51,500 --> 01:36:55,500
They didn't announce this with very much advance notice about the Miyamoto thing, did they?

1245
01:36:56,500 --> 01:37:00,500
Only on NintendoWorld.com and if you're on the Nintendo mailing list.

1246
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:05,500
Wow. Well, that kind of sucks. I'm sorry to hear about that. It got so crowded over there.

1247
01:37:06,500 --> 01:37:07,500
So there was like 12 people?

1248
01:37:07,500 --> 01:37:15,500
No, like 12 million. Believe me, I know so many straight guys that would go down on Miyamoto.

1249
01:37:15,500 --> 01:37:22,500
It's amazing. He's a god to some people, so I'm sure people came out of droves. No, I do know some.

1250
01:37:22,500 --> 01:37:25,500
There was about 800 people there.

1251
01:37:25,500 --> 01:37:32,500
Alright, well, wow. Well, it's too bad you didn't get to see him, but how's the Nintendo store?

1252
01:37:32,500 --> 01:37:38,500
It's pretty sweet. It's really sweet. It's really nice because it looks so modern, you know?

1253
01:37:38,500 --> 01:37:44,500
Before when it was a Pokemon it looked all kitty, but it looks really modern, like so 90's chic, you know?

1254
01:37:44,500 --> 01:37:46,500
Very cool. Very cool. All right.

1255
01:37:46,500 --> 01:37:48,500
I'm also...a few more things and then I'll go.

1256
01:37:48,500 --> 01:37:49,500
Sure.

1257
01:37:49,500 --> 01:37:53,500
I'm seeing a link to the chat of a bunch of us hanging out today, trying to get inside.

1258
01:37:53,500 --> 01:37:59,500
Okay, so check that out. Ron Chan just posted that in our chat room there. It's a photo bucket link of pictures from today.

1259
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:03,120
uh... and and maybe if you look very carefully you might be one little pixel

1260
01:38:03,120 --> 01:38:04,940
that happens to be miyamoto

1261
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:07,800
it's three pictures of miyamoto okay cool

1262
01:38:07,800 --> 01:38:09,200
you got it from the window and

1263
01:38:09,200 --> 01:38:13,700
the first i was on the line he flew in from detroit he was there since twelve

1264
01:38:13,700 --> 01:38:16,020
noon saturday

1265
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,320

1267
01:38:20,940 --> 01:38:22,820

1269
01:38:25,020 --> 01:38:28,020
Yeah, that's me, that's Link, yeah, that's my friend, uh, Greg, my Minish hat.

1270
01:38:28,020 --> 01:38:31,020
You dressed up, you dressed up in a Minish cap there?

1271
01:38:32,020 --> 01:38:36,020
No, somebody actually came with a Minish cap. That was my classic Link hat that was made for me.

1272
01:38:36,020 --> 01:38:38,020
You bought a Minish cap and it came with a person?

1273
01:38:39,020 --> 01:38:40,020
No, I wish.

1274
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:46,020
But, um, if you see, like, the little pink hats my friend made, those, the Princess Pea hats, if you notice those.

1275
01:38:46,020 --> 01:38:52,020
You guys are nuts. Here's Luigi, we're looking at him. Somebody in a Luigi hat. That's awesome.

1276
01:38:52,020 --> 01:38:56,620
We were watching Advent Children.

1277
01:38:56,620 --> 01:38:59,900
You guys are such nerds, but that's why I love ya.

1278
01:38:59,900 --> 01:39:01,540
You think that's something?

1279
01:39:01,540 --> 01:39:05,580
When Miyamoto came to the window, we all ran to the side.

1280
01:39:05,580 --> 01:39:08,900
Do you remember the Super Mario Brothers 3 commercial where they were chanting Mario?

1281
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:12,460
We were chanting Mario just like that.

1282
01:39:12,460 --> 01:39:15,420
Second time we came to the window, we were shouting, Nintendo!

1283
01:39:15,420 --> 01:39:16,420
Nintendo!

1284
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:25,420
People throwing up, holding up their Nintendo controllers, pads, consoles, power pads, power gloves, u-forces.

1285
01:39:25,420 --> 01:39:30,420
Somebody walked down the street with an autographed power glove. I'm telling you.

1286
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:32,420
Autographed by who?

1287
01:39:32,420 --> 01:39:33,420
That is so bad.

1288
01:39:33,420 --> 01:39:39,420
Oh yeah, MTV was there and they're going to put a bunch of this on the whole Xbox video gaming special next month.

1289
01:39:39,420 --> 01:39:43,420
Wait, you're going to be on the Xbox video game special?

1290
01:39:43,420 --> 01:39:47,600
they do like a video game special a week that xbox comes out and they did a complete cover

1291
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:55,320
of miyamoto being in town wait but but but do you see the problem with this is it just

1292
01:39:55,320 --> 01:40:03,520
me because miyamoto last i checked works for nintendo nintendo mtv nintendo xbox not nintendo

1293
01:40:03,520 --> 01:40:12,640
wait i thought nintendo made the xbox i'm completely wrong oh my god yeah i would have

1294
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:16,140
I'd love to see the MTV crew going up going,

1295
01:40:16,140 --> 01:40:20,640
Hey, so can we be first in line to order our Xbox 360 here?

1296
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,140
No.

1297
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,640
Yeah, I could see them interviewing Miyamoto.

1298
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:28,140
So what do we have to look forward to in Halo 3?

1299
01:40:28,140 --> 01:40:31,140
We actually joke about that online, okay?

1300
01:40:31,140 --> 01:40:34,140
Well, at the end of, if you don't beat Halo 3 in a certain amount of time,

1301
01:40:34,140 --> 01:40:38,140
then the moon is going to crash into the world and...

1302
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:42,140
We're sorry, Master Chief, but our princess is in another castle.

1303
01:40:42,140 --> 01:40:47,740

1305
01:40:55,100 --> 01:41:04,780
Miyamoto interview during an Xbox special idiots that's the talented MTV

1306
01:41:04,780 --> 01:41:13,580
MTV stands for what again must mushy trashy videos I don't know you only see

1307
01:41:13,580 --> 01:41:17,300

01:42:08,500 --> 01:42:10,500
Yeah, that's the thing we're going to give away.

1323
01:42:10,500 --> 01:42:13,500
We have to talk about this during the break, how we're going to give this away, so we'll see.

1324
01:42:13,500 --> 01:42:14,500
In pieces.

1325
01:42:14,500 --> 01:42:16,500
Alright, in pieces.

1326
01:42:16,500 --> 01:42:17,500
Alright, we'll be back after this.

1327
01:42:17,500 --> 01:42:22,500
In this break, we're going to do one of my favorite songs from the UltraMix 3 v-rare because it sounds like synthpop.

1328
01:42:22,500 --> 01:42:24,500
It's Raindancer with Come With Me.

1329
01:42:24,500 --> 01:42:29,500
And then we're going to get to another song which I don't have labeled because I'm a dumbass.

1330
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:32,460
It's Track 10.

1331
01:42:32,460 --> 01:42:33,300
What was Track 10?

1332
01:42:33,300 --> 01:42:36,540
I think it's another, um, poop.

1333
01:42:36,540 --> 01:42:37,020
No, it's not.

1334
01:42:37,020 --> 01:42:39,580
But we're also going to do the UltraMix 3 medley in this

1335
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:42,500
break, the song pack medley, so you guys can hear little

1336
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,220
clips of Love Me Do and 250 BPM.

1337
01:42:45,220 --> 01:42:46,500
Rainbow Flyer.

1338
01:42:46,500 --> 01:42:48,700
Damn it, I knew it was the one I was missing.

1339
01:42:48,700 --> 01:42:49,980
I couldn't hear you.

1340
01:42:49,980 --> 01:42:51,500
Rainbow Flyer is going to be the other song we

1341
01:42:51,500 --> 01:42:52,260
hear in this break.

1342
01:42:52,260 --> 01:42:53,900
So we'll be back after this with more

1343
01:42:53,900 --> 01:42:55,540
Orange Lounge Radio.

1344
01:42:55,540 --> 01:43:24,260
Come with me now Life in the distance

1345
01:43:24,260 --> 01:43:27,260
Showing me the way I've forgotten

1346
01:43:27,260 --> 01:43:30,260
I've gone too far in confusion

1347
01:43:30,260 --> 01:43:34,260
I've been lost

1348
01:43:34,260 --> 01:43:37,260
It may take some time

1349
01:43:37,260 --> 01:43:40,260
But somehow I will get

1350
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:44,260

I don't know what it is I expect to find

1356
01:44:04,260 --> 01:44:08,260
But I'll always want you here by my side

1357

1370
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:04,320
you might just be SOL but what I do want to point out is something actually a

1371
01:51:04,320 --> 01:51:08,020
suck arena brought this to my attention there's a brand new page posted over at

1372
01:51:08,020 --> 01:51:13,480
Konami style that actually has some more information about guitar freaks V the

1373
01:51:13,480 --> 01:51:18,440
home release of course that being a big surprise at the Tokyo game show this

1374
01:51:18,440 --> 01:51:23,340
here is that they are going to revive the Guitar Freak Stromania series with V and look

1375
01:51:23,340 --> 01:51:28,360
at this, look at that, that is an ASC ladies and gentlemen, that is the arcade style controller.

1376
01:51:28,360 --> 01:51:32,780
Completely, look at that, they have the little metal cord and everything, and the little

1377
01:51:32,780 --> 01:51:38,280
strap, that is going to be bad ass, I want one. So check that out, and the link again

1378
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:44,560
is posted in the chatroom, it's over at konamistyle.jp in their custom factory, aren't those things

1379
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:51,560
going to be expensive though? Yeah, I know. I am not a big enough fan of Guitar Freaks.

1380
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:54,560
Do they have an extra hole so you can use it for other things?

1381
01:51:54,560 --> 01:52:00,060
Yeah, but you know I'm going to have one at my house because my husband is the world's

1382
01:52:00,060 --> 01:52:01,560
biggest Guitar Freaks fan.

1383
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:06,160
Well, you know, they advertise the game as Guitar Freaks and Drummania is being released,

1384
01:52:06,160 --> 01:52:10,240
so right now with the arcade-style controller for Guitar Freaks, I believe they're Konami

1385
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,800
styles doing the petition thing to get their polls and see like, okay, how much do you

1386
01:52:13,800 --> 01:52:18,580
fan do you really want it okay so there may there may be you know

1387
01:52:18,580 --> 01:52:22,800
drum mania arcade controller or something like that following it

1388
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:28,080
eventually or soon after or something which will be equally or more scary with

1389
01:52:28,080 --> 01:52:34,720
the price yeah I just I'm just I'm so excited they're bringing guitar freaks

1390
01:52:34,720 --> 01:52:37,320
back though what I'm what I'm really excited and I hope they do is that they

1391
01:52:37,320 --> 01:52:42,360
really just fill up these mixes with old songs that they missed out on like

1392
01:52:42,360 --> 01:52:44,960
because you know otherwise we're never going to get a lot of the great songs

1393
01:52:44,960 --> 01:52:47,960
that we're in like you know fifth six and all that stuff like I don't know

1394
01:52:47,960 --> 01:52:52,720
fireball and I'm trying to every song that keeps coming to my mind was a

1395
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:56,560
licensed song because fifth had a lot of them haru spring I don't know but we we

1396
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,400
need to see some of these songs on a home mix so I really want to see that

1397
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:08,200
so anyway check that out check that out on Konami style all right what we do now

1398
01:53:08,200 --> 01:53:11,280
we're gonna place a very special phone call we've got a phone call that we need

1399
01:53:11,280 --> 01:53:15,280
to make and we're gonna place that right now what we're gonna do is we're gonna

1400
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:18,840
call somebody who's actually in the hospital and that's somebody who's been

1401
01:53:18,840 --> 01:53:22,720
on the show previously but it's not a bad reason why she's in the hospital

1402
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:28,120
you'll see why momentarily first I got to make sure I'm putting in the number

1403
01:53:28,120 --> 01:53:33,400
correctly here we'll call this number here doo doo doo doo doo hopefully this

1404
01:53:33,400 --> 01:53:38,880
connects this would be quite embarrassing if this old damn thing

1405
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:43,200
didn't work those of you guys there in the chat room probably know what this is

1406

We are so happy for you, Anita. We want to see pictures. We want to see pictures. When do we get to see pictures?

1418
01:55:24,300 --> 01:55:29,300
Uh, soon. Very soon. I'll be coming home from the hospital tomorrow.

1419
01:55:29,300 --> 01:55:32,300
So I'll be able to post some pictures on the net.

1420
01:55:32,300 --> 01:55:35,300
Alright. And if those of you guys are wondering why we have...

1421
01:55:35,300 --> 01:55:36,300
I have a live journal.

1422
01:55:36,300 --> 01:55:37,300
Uh-huh.

1423
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:40,300
And I can go on Orange Lounge, um, if, if...

1424
01:55:40,300 --> 01:55:45,300
I can figure out, uh, to be on the Orange Lounge, uh, website.

1425
01:55:45,300 --> 01:55:51,660
absolutely absolutely you've got to post those absolutely you got to post that on

1426
01:55:51,660 --> 01:56:09,380
the site for us so well oh very very quiet it's very quiet but Skype is kind

1427
01:56:09,380 --> 01:56:12,300
of sucking tonight anyway but it's very quiet but I could hear it a little bit

1428
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:13,740
That's so cute.

1429
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:16,220
We're so happy for you.

1430
01:56:16,220 --> 01:56:17,820
Thank you so much.

1431
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:20,380
I'm so happy and proud, too.

1432
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:22,340
I'm so glad I can share it with you guys.

1433
01:56:22,340 --> 01:56:23,220
No problem.

1434
01:56:23,220 --> 01:56:25,060
I'm so glad to be here.

1435
01:56:25,060 --> 01:56:26,060
Get well soon.

1436
01:56:26,060 --> 01:56:28,940
And I'm asking Daniel to send me the hospital information

1437
01:56:28,940 --> 01:56:31,580
so I can hopefully visit soon, like this week sometime.

1438
01:56:31,580 --> 01:56:34,300
Well, hopefully you won't be there much longer, but you know.

1439
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,540
Oh, she's out tomorrow?

1440
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:36,340
Oh, I didn't know.

1441
01:56:36,340 --> 01:56:37,380
Yeah, I'm out tomorrow.

1442
01:56:37,380 --> 01:56:38,100
Oh, well, crap.

1443
01:56:38,100 --> 01:56:39,260
Well, I still want to come see the baby,

1444
01:56:39,260 --> 01:56:41,020
so I'll have to come to your house.

1445
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:42,100
I know it's a long drive.

1446
01:56:42,100 --> 01:56:46,660
but maybe I can do it in the next couple weeks or so.

1447
01:56:46,660 --> 01:56:47,380
OK.

1448
01:56:47,380 --> 01:56:51,220
All right, well, I'll contact you offline.

1449
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:51,780
OK.

1450
01:56:51,780 --> 01:56:54,140
All right, well, Anita, congratulations once again

1451
01:56:54,140 --> 01:56:57,060
from all of us here at Orange Launch Radio to you.

1452
01:56:57,060 --> 01:56:59,620
One of our regulars having a baby, we're so excited.

1453
01:56:59,620 --> 01:57:00,820
So congratulations.

1454
01:57:00,820 --> 01:57:04,140
And tell Donovan we said hi.

1455
01:57:04,140 --> 01:57:05,180
Oh, I will.

1456
01:57:05,180 --> 01:57:07,100
Thank you guys very much, too.

1457
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:07,980
No problem.

1458
01:57:07,980 --> 01:57:08,480
Kiss.

1459
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:14,480
everybody, all my friends, all my Bamani friends, and all my Orange Munch friends. Hi, everybody.

1460
01:57:14,480 --> 01:57:15,480
Share those drugs.

1461
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:18,480
Kisses! Kisses, honey. Take care.

1462
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,480
Okay.

1463
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:20,480
All right. Bye-bye.

1464
01:57:20,480 --> 01:57:21,480
Bye-bye.

1465
01:57:21,480 --> 01:57:22,480
Bye-bye.

1466
01:57:22,480 --> 01:57:27,480
Aw, so sweet. I apologize to our listeners that Skype is a little bit crappy. I don't

1467
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,920
really know how else to phrase that. Skype's running a little bit crappy. But our chat

1468
01:57:30,920 --> 01:57:35,720
room is just full of congratulations there. Daniel's actually in chat right now, so if

1469
01:57:35,720 --> 01:57:38,120
We want to give congratulations to Daddy.

1470
01:57:38,120 --> 01:57:41,240
Daddy's in chat right now, OrangeLawnsRadio.com.

1471
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:45,400
Click on chat, and he's there to take those good wishes back

1472
01:57:45,400 --> 01:57:47,600
to Anita from those of you guys in chat,

1473
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,840
since you weren't able to talk to her on Skype.

1474
01:57:49,840 --> 01:57:51,880
All right, well, I think it's time now for us

1475
01:57:51,880 --> 01:57:56,960
to move into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

1476
01:57:56,960 --> 01:58:00,320
The way the cage match works is that we play three songs

1477
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:02,640
for you, back to back to back, and you guys

1478
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:04,240
vote for your favorites.

1479
01:58:04,240 --> 01:58:09,360
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's

1480
01:58:09,360 --> 01:58:13,920
Vibani and Video Game Music program, which plays 24 hours a day, seven days a week on

1481
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:15,360
this station when we're not here.

1482
01:58:15,360 --> 01:58:18,360
What we're going to hear first is last week's winner.

1483
01:58:18,360 --> 01:58:21,760
You only get to hear a clip of it because it's last week's winner, so therefore you've

1484
01:58:21,760 --> 01:58:24,380
already hypothetically heard this song.

1485
01:58:24,380 --> 01:58:30,040
It is Yuzo Koshiro, and it's from Langan Midnight Maximum Tune.

1486
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,600
Did I get that right this time?

1487
01:58:31,600 --> 01:58:32,600
Yes.

1488
01:58:32,600 --> 01:58:33,600
Right on.

1489
01:58:33,600 --> 01:58:40,600
is Destination Blackout, and it was Mrs. Dark Sakura's pick from last week.

1490
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:44,600
Don't roll your eyes at me, marriage is bliss, blah blah blah.

1491
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:45,100
Is it?

1492
01:58:45,100 --> 01:58:52,100
Alright, here it is, a clip of song number one, Destination Blackout here on Orange Lounge, the cage match.

1493
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:19,100
We're doing it one way or another

1494
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,100
One way or another

1495
01:59:35,100 --> 01:59:36,100
No more empathy

1496
01:59:36,100 --> 01:59:38,100
One, two, three, four.

1497
02:00:06,100 --> 02:00:30,300
One, two, three, four!

1498
02:00:30,300 --> 02:00:35,300
One, two, three, four!

1499
02:00:35,300 --> 02:00:49,180
Alrighty, that was a clip of song number one, Yuzo Koshiro with Destination Blackout.

1500
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:53,020
Received some very good marks on last week's show, so we'll see if it continues to win

1501
02:00:53,020 --> 02:00:57,180
for a second week in a row, or if it falls prey to one of our challengers tonight.

1502
02:00:57,180 --> 02:00:58,180
Loki, you're up first.

1503
02:00:58,180 --> 02:01:00,780
What did you pick for us tonight?

1504
02:01:00,780 --> 02:01:23,780
Well, I got a copy of the Diverse 9 album, and this is one of the tracks, actually one of the last tracks, and I remember listening to the demo of this back when I was looking at the tracklist scenes when we covered it on the show, and this song reminded me of the Black Mages, but, you know, it's a song that you've all heard before, so, enjoy!

1505
02:01:23,780 --> 02:01:31,940
All right, what is the name of this here Dorisia with V. Yeah. All right Dorisia with V. Enjoy

1506
02:05:23,780 --> 02:05:44,060
That one's coming to you courtesy of Diverse Systems.

1507
02:05:44,060 --> 02:05:50,820
That's Dorisia with V. Let's go around and see if V gets an A or an F.

1508
02:05:50,820 --> 02:05:51,820
Dark Sakura.

1509
02:05:51,820 --> 02:05:53,740
I couldn't get into it.

1510
02:05:53,740 --> 02:05:56,740
It just was... disjointed.

1511
02:05:56,740 --> 02:05:58,740
Disjointed. Okay.

1512
02:05:58,740 --> 02:06:04,740
So, it gets... it was above average, but definitely below the greatest thing I've ever heard, so...

1513
02:06:04,740 --> 02:06:08,740
Definitely better than just about everything I've heard off that v-ware, so...

1514
02:06:08,740 --> 02:06:11,740
It gets a... seven and a half.

1515
02:06:11,740 --> 02:06:13,740
Seven and a half. Loki!

1516
02:06:13,740 --> 02:06:16,740
Get the nine. I've been blasting this into my car.

1517
02:06:16,740 --> 02:06:18,740
Bugged.

1518
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:20,740
Seven.

1519
02:06:20,740 --> 02:06:22,740
Garret.

1520
02:06:22,740 --> 02:06:36,740
I'm gonna give it an 8. I liked it, but I don't know. Something about Bahmani songs in Cage Match is weird to me, but I still liked it, so I'm gonna give it an 8. So, it was cool.

1521
02:06:36,740 --> 02:06:51,740
Alright, my song, we're gonna do it tonight. Song number 3. Now, a lot of people have been ripping on Zonk over that remix, so I thought, okay, I'm gonna give Zonk a chance with one of their original songs. So I'm gonna put Zonk in tonight's Cage Match, because I really couldn't think of anything else.

1522
02:06:51,740 --> 02:06:59,740
It's not a Bahmani song. It's not a Bahmani song. It's an original Zonk song. Kiss my butt.

1523
02:06:59,740 --> 02:07:13,740
Alright, this is Zonk, song number three tonight with Nervous, Excited, Delighted. Check this out. It's one of their original songs from their latest EP which is called... Shit, I don't remember the name of this EP. I think it's...

1524
02:07:13,740 --> 02:07:15,740
I would order it just on that name alone.

1525
02:07:15,740 --> 02:07:17,960
Half Human, thank you, Half Human is the name of it.

1526
02:07:17,960 --> 02:07:20,500
All right, here it is, Nervous, Excited, Delighted.

1527
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:21,900
Enjoy.

1528
02:07:21,900 --> 02:07:50,900
Just to show why I'm still a tear

1529
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:55,900
Rushed at hammering strings

1530
02:07:55,900 --> 02:07:58,900
Nellowed dramatic guts

1531
02:07:58,900 --> 02:08:00,900
Slapping energy

1532
02:08:00,900 --> 02:08:07,900
Beating up to the scary center stage

1533
02:08:09,900 --> 02:08:12,900
Why don't we talk in a merry way?

1534
02:08:12,900 --> 02:08:14,900
Try to keep the world from breaking

1535
02:08:14,900 --> 02:08:17,900
And the pressure is beating me from every direction

1536
02:08:17,900 --> 02:08:20,400
Nothing makes it, I got nothing but the fear I left it

1537
02:08:20,400 --> 02:08:21,900
What? We can't fail

1538
02:08:21,900 --> 02:08:23,400
It's time to go on

1539
02:08:23,400 --> 02:08:25,400
It's time to write this piece and get the show on

1540
02:08:25,400 --> 02:08:27,400
We party and we grieve and we get to take my food

1541
02:08:27,400 --> 02:08:29,400
And we're doing it, yeah, you and me

1542
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:30,400
That's how we do it

1543
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:34,400
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love

1544
02:08:34,400 --> 02:08:37,400
What a fright

1545
02:08:37,400 --> 02:08:40,400
Something dangerous

1546
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,400
Love gets excited, it's a lie

1547
02:08:43,400 --> 02:08:48,400
It's not that dangerous

1548
02:09:00,400 --> 02:09:05,400
Silence before the explosion

1549
02:09:05,400 --> 02:09:10,400
Space is in slow motion

1550
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:14,400
Strike up a code

1551
02:09:15,400 --> 02:09:19,400
We are ready to go

1552
02:09:19,400 --> 02:09:21,400
Now it's time to get with us

1553
02:09:21,400 --> 02:09:24,400
And get this week, we'll fix you up

1554
02:09:24,400 --> 02:09:26,400
So wave your hands and kick your butt

1555
02:09:26,400 --> 02:09:29,400
It's time that we get dangerous

1556
02:09:29,400 --> 02:09:33,400
Firelight full of foreshadows

1557
02:09:33,400 --> 02:09:38,400
Something dangerous

1558
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:48,400
Love is excited, delighted, something dangerous

1559
02:09:48,400 --> 02:09:53,400
Play dress and clothes to offer though

1560
02:09:53,400 --> 02:09:59,400
This must be angsty rock and roll

1561
02:09:59,400 --> 02:10:04,400
Pre-delayed and terrified

1562
02:10:04,400 --> 02:10:09,400
And let's highlight the night

1563
02:10:09,400 --> 02:10:28,400
Night, night, night, night

1564
02:10:28,400 --> 02:10:32,400
Nervous, excited, delighted

1565
02:10:32,700 --> 02:10:36,400
Something dangerous

1566
02:10:38,300 --> 02:10:42,300
Nervous, excited, delighted

1567
02:10:42,700 --> 02:10:46,700
Something dangerous

1568
02:10:48,200 --> 02:10:52,400
Nervous, excited, delighted

1569
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:56,400
Something dangerous

1570
02:10:56,400 --> 02:11:07,400
Now that this day is a lie, there's something dangerous

1571
02:11:07,400 --> 02:11:27,400
Do you want this? Do you need this?

1572
02:11:27,400 --> 02:11:47,400
Do you want it? Do you need it?

1573
02:11:57,400 --> 02:12:09,400
Song number three in tonight's cage match is Zonk. Nervous, excited, delighted. Let's see if that song delighted the folks here in the studio. But remember, it's not up to us, it's up to you guys in chat.

1574
02:12:09,400 --> 02:12:15,400
My first impression of it was that I was liking it, I was getting into it, and then it started to repeat.

1575
02:12:15,400 --> 02:12:21,400
And it's sort of like, duh, duh, duh, repeat, repeat...

1576
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:23,400
Oh, it's over!

1577
02:12:23,400 --> 02:12:32,400
So, um, I like it better than Loki's pick, because it had a cool kind of groove to it, and wasn't all disjointed, but it did sort of...

1578
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:35,400
Are you saying it had a good beat, and it was easy to dance to?

1579
02:12:35,400 --> 02:12:39,600
to dance to. No, it had a good beat, but I would probably fall asleep dancing to it.

1580
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:47,600
So, um, it gets an 8.5. 8.5 from Dark Sakura. Loki! It gets, like, a 7.5, because it was

1581
02:12:47,600 --> 02:12:53,320
better than the remix that was on the Ultramix, um, 3 soundtrack, but, uh, they do some weird

1582
02:12:53,320 --> 02:12:57,800
stuff. It, it was okay, though. I didn't find it repetitive or anything like that. It was

1583
02:12:57,800 --> 02:13:01,800
I didn't want it, nor did I need it. Five.

1584
02:13:01,800 --> 02:13:05,800
Good. I zonked out six.

1585
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:09,800
Um, I actually, you know, I kinda liked it. I liked it better than

1586
02:13:09,800 --> 02:13:13,800
Tittle Tattle, and I liked it better than their Ultramix 3 remix. And I think if they

1587
02:13:13,800 --> 02:13:17,800
DDR cut that, they'd lose a lot of the repetitiveness of the song, and I think it'd be a pretty groovy

1588
02:13:17,800 --> 02:13:21,800
cut for DDR, so I hope they consider it for Ultramix Sweat 4.

1589
02:13:21,800 --> 02:13:25,800
Or, heck, the next Ultramix will probably be a 360 game.

1590
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:32,800
Ultramix 360, the three songs you can vote for in tonight's cage match, song number one

1591
02:13:34,040 --> 02:13:41,040
is Destination Blackout, last week's winner. And song number two you can vote for tonight

1592
02:13:41,040 --> 02:13:59,500
And song number two you can vote for tonight is Dorisia with Thee.

1593
02:13:59,500 --> 02:14:03,660
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Zonk with Nervous Excited Delighted.

1594
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:19,020
Place vote now, send a private message to Skye in the chatroom with your vote.

1595
02:14:19,020 --> 02:14:21,180
Now you can flood me with private messages, that's okay.

1596
02:14:21,180 --> 02:14:24,100
I need to interrupt for something that's really freaking stupid.

1597
02:14:24,100 --> 02:14:25,100
Oh jeez.

1598
02:14:25,100 --> 02:14:26,100
Alright, what, wait.

1599
02:14:26,100 --> 02:14:27,100
Place vote now, we'll get to your votes momentarily.

1600
02:14:27,100 --> 02:14:28,100
What?

1601
02:14:28,100 --> 02:14:30,820
Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico, and this is not from the onion, this is from

1602
02:14:30,820 --> 02:14:31,820
Slashdot.

1603
02:14:31,820 --> 02:14:35,820
Armed dolphins?

1604
02:14:35,820 --> 02:14:39,820
Armed dolphins released into Gulf of Mexico. Dolphins don't have arms.

1605
02:14:39,820 --> 02:14:43,820
Finned dolphins?

1606
02:14:43,820 --> 02:14:47,820
That sounds like the next Grand Theft Auto game to me.

1607
02:14:47,820 --> 02:14:51,820
Are they ill-tempered? Taking the series where no one has dared take it before.

1608
02:14:51,820 --> 02:14:55,820
Dolphins.

1609
02:14:55,820 --> 02:14:59,820
I noticed my roommate Extrafur is here, so I want to give Extrafur a chance to say something on the show. Don't zone out on me.

1610
02:14:59,820 --> 02:15:00,820
Hi.

1611
02:15:00,820 --> 02:15:06,580
Well, no, actually, you know, we did a segment a couple of weeks ago, I'd like to bring back

1612
02:15:06,580 --> 02:15:09,100
this segment, and that would be Extrovert's movie review.

1613
02:15:09,100 --> 02:15:10,740
Oh, okay.

1614
02:15:10,740 --> 02:15:15,660
Okay, so Extrovert, give us a movie review on Corpse Bride.

1615
02:15:15,660 --> 02:15:18,340
Corpse Bride, it was pretty good.

1616
02:15:18,340 --> 02:15:22,220
It was good watching excitement in the theater.

1617
02:15:22,220 --> 02:15:23,220
Thank you for that review.

1618
02:15:23,220 --> 02:15:24,220
Thumbs up?

1619
02:15:24,220 --> 02:15:25,220
Thumbs down?

1620
02:15:25,220 --> 02:15:26,940
It was nicely done.

1621
02:15:26,940 --> 02:15:32,220
I liked The Nightmare Before Christmas better, but this one definitely had...

1622
02:15:32,220 --> 02:15:33,220
It was more emotional.

1623
02:15:33,220 --> 02:15:36,740
It was more, like, dramatic than The Nightmare Before Christmas.

1624
02:15:36,740 --> 02:15:37,740
All right.

1625
02:15:37,740 --> 02:15:39,780
So, anyways, that's my whole take on that.

1626
02:15:39,780 --> 02:15:42,900
Thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideways, thumb up and ass.

1627
02:15:42,900 --> 02:15:45,300
Thumbs diagonal ways.

1628
02:15:45,300 --> 02:15:46,300
Thumbs diagonal ways.

1629
02:15:46,300 --> 02:15:47,300
Yeah.

1630
02:15:47,300 --> 02:15:48,300
Okay.

1631
02:15:48,300 --> 02:15:49,300
Up.

1632
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:50,300
I don't know.

1633
02:15:50,300 --> 02:15:51,300
I was starting to think of Margaret Cho's mother, her impression.

1634
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:54,300
OH MY BUDDY TO JUMP!

1635
02:15:54,300 --> 02:15:57,300
Oh my buddy was jumping!

1636
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,300
All right.

1637
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:00,300
People were exploding in the theater.

1638
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,300
It was great.

1639
02:16:01,300 --> 02:16:02,300
All right.

1640
02:16:02,300 --> 02:16:03,300
Thank you extrovert for that.

1641
02:16:03,300 --> 02:16:04,300
God blood on me.

1642
02:16:04,300 --> 02:16:07,300
Now see, what movie are you going to see next week that you can review?

1643
02:16:07,300 --> 02:16:13,300
Um, well, I'm going to see Serenity again, but I've already, like, talked that one up like crazy.

1644
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:16,300
So you're going to have to see two movies so you have something for us next Sunday.

1645
02:16:16,300 --> 02:16:17,300
Okay.

1646
02:16:17,300 --> 02:16:18,300
Don't let me down.

1647
02:16:18,300 --> 02:16:19,300
Okay.

1648
02:16:19,300 --> 02:16:20,300
Rent something on Netflix, DVD, I don't know.

1649
02:16:20,300 --> 02:16:22,300
Find a movie and review it next week.

1650
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:57,180
I need to see that she's never seen it at all I've only seen the butchered one

1651
02:16:57,180 --> 02:17:01,860
I've never seen the movie at all I've seen I've already seen it all the way

1652
02:17:01,860 --> 02:17:06,780
through because I had a French copy of it a while back like is the uncut

1653
02:17:06,780 --> 02:17:11,540
version does he have sex with her or something makes it so she kisses him oh

1654
02:17:11,540 --> 02:17:19,300
okay it has more of the love story in it oh for those you guys in chat somebody's

1655
02:17:19,300 --> 02:17:23,900
freaking out about serenity? Where? It's this Friday in the theaters.

1656
02:17:23,900 --> 02:17:27,900
You can check out Yahoo.com enter in your zip code and you can find out like the rest of us.

1657
02:17:27,900 --> 02:17:29,900
And it's really really really really really good.

1658
02:17:29,900 --> 02:17:31,900
Because you saw a sneak preview, right?

1659
02:17:31,900 --> 02:17:32,900
I did see a sneak preview.

1660
02:17:32,900 --> 02:17:33,900
Good job.

1661
02:17:33,900 --> 02:17:36,900
And it has all the hot mens in it, right?

1662
02:17:36,900 --> 02:17:39,900
It has a few hot mens in it.

1663
02:17:39,900 --> 02:17:41,900
Because I think the captain is hot.

1664
02:17:41,900 --> 02:17:45,900
The captain is hot, so Simon is hot.

1665
02:17:45,900 --> 02:17:48,900
when you're a professional movie reviewer like you are now on orange

1666
02:17:48,900 --> 02:17:49,500

02:18:13,540 --> 02:18:18,540
Sim update. Loki, what's going on in the Sim world?

1676
02:18:18,540 --> 02:18:23,540
Well, I played more Food Mix 2, and it was good.

1677
02:18:23,540 --> 02:18:30,540
Still nothing really too much else going on other than the release of Food Mix 2 last week.

1678
02:18:30,540 --> 02:18:36,540
Really, I think Turning Mix 6 is over. I hope it is, because I'm over with it.

1679
02:18:36,540 --> 02:18:43,260
And um, there's a new um, what was it, a new, there's another new file tournament coming

1680
02:18:43,260 --> 02:18:44,260
up.

1681
02:18:44,260 --> 02:18:45,540
Really, nothing going on.

1682
02:18:45,540 --> 02:18:46,540
Nothing at all.

1683
02:18:46,540 --> 02:18:49,840
Just played Food Mix 2 and waited out.

1684
02:18:49,840 --> 02:18:52,580
You need to fill time with something because I'm tallying cage match votes here.

1685
02:18:52,580 --> 02:18:53,580
Last call for cage match votes.

1686
02:18:53,580 --> 02:19:03,020
Anyways, since I'm filling time, um, yeah I need some alcohol, no, um, well is it Reef

1687
02:19:03,020 --> 02:19:15,020
The movie for Madison is awesome. It's so funny. It's got a lot of funny people. A lot of funny people.

1688
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:20,020
This is a Showtime thing. I actually want to see the stage play of it. It looks really neat.

1689
02:19:20,020 --> 02:19:28,020
It's basically an anti-marijuana movie. Or was, supposedly. It's based off a 1930s propaganda film put out by the government.

1690
02:19:28,020 --> 02:19:32,540
and uh... where basically people smoke pot and then they turn into zombies and kill people

1691
02:19:32,540 --> 02:19:37,880
and like have sex and turn the whores and worship cities. That means we want to smoke pot.

1692
02:19:37,880 --> 02:19:40,280
It's a great movie.

1693
02:19:40,280 --> 02:19:43,840
Yes, so basically um...

1694
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:48,260
Stop it. Okay, basically has Alan Cummings, he's the main guy who's actually kind of like

1695
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:51,420
the government guy who's telling everybody about, you know,

1696
02:19:51,420 --> 02:19:56,420
how reefer's bad. He was also in Josie and the Pussycats, mighty fine roll. The main

1697
02:19:56,420 --> 02:20:01,920
It was played by Christian Campbell, which is Nev Campbell's brother, and Nev Campbell's also in it.

1698
02:20:01,920 --> 02:20:05,920
He was in a movie called Trick, which you'd know about if you're a fag.

1699
02:20:05,920 --> 02:20:13,920
Okay. Who else was in this? Oh, fellow SNL cast member Ana Gasteyer was in it.

1700
02:20:13,920 --> 02:20:14,920
Okay.

1701
02:20:14,920 --> 02:20:15,920
She was hilarious.

1702
02:20:15,920 --> 02:20:19,920
Love her impersonation of Martha Stewart. Topless Halloween special.

1703
02:20:19,920 --> 02:20:21,920
Christmas special.

1704
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:22,920
Whatever.

1705
02:20:22,920 --> 02:20:30,920
It was pretty funny. I highly recommend it. It's coming out. It's going to be packaged with the actual 1930s movie as well, and it's really funny.

1706
02:20:30,920 --> 02:20:32,920
Great. All right, thank you.

1707
02:20:32,920 --> 02:20:33,920
Actually, I need to ask Axta for something.

1708
02:20:33,920 --> 02:20:34,920
Okay.

1709
02:20:34,920 --> 02:20:40,920
My friend in her live journal described Corpse Bride, and I want to see if you agree with her description.

1710
02:20:40,920 --> 02:20:41,920
Okay.

1711
02:20:41,920 --> 02:20:47,920
Corpse Bride was one of those nice heartwarming tales that touches you in all the wrong places.

1712
02:20:47,920 --> 02:20:51,920
Well, I didn't feel physically touched by it.

1713
02:20:51,920 --> 02:20:55,920
Show me on the doll where Corpse Bride touched you.

1714
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:59,920
It touched me in the pee-pee.

1715
02:20:59,920 --> 02:21:03,920
It felt good.

1716
02:21:03,920 --> 02:21:07,920
I'm not touching that!

1717
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:11,920
Okay, I think we need to save this show by giving something away! Yay! Let's give some shit away!

1718
02:21:11,920 --> 02:21:15,920
DarkSakura, pull a number out of the hat, which actually would be your ass

1733
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:32,440
So congratulations, Fireboma, who apparently left chat and went to bed. Good job. Fireboma.

1734
02:22:32,440 --> 02:22:36,720
I think that disqualifies him. No, we can't disqualify him. He won fair and

1735
02:22:36,720 --> 02:22:42,780
square. He won. Bastard. Leaving and going to sleep. All right. Who needs sleep? Sleep

1736
02:22:42,780 --> 02:22:47,700
is for weenies. All right. And some folks in chat say they want the max 2 v-rare still

1737
02:22:47,700 --> 02:22:52,100
very bad and they heard me slip up earlier and say that we actually have three max 2

1738
02:22:52,100 --> 02:22:59,100
v-rares and two EX2s. So we will find a way to give those away. Absolutely. Maybe a bonus?

1739
02:22:59,100 --> 02:23:03,500
Maybe. We'll see. We'll see. We might give away a bonus or something. Well congratulations

1740
02:23:03,500 --> 02:23:10,220

1741
02:23:10,220 --> 02:23:13,620

1742
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:16,860

1743
02:23:16,860 --> 02:23:20,340
orange or Lauren's lunch that's not the people who leave us to go watch Family

1744
02:23:20,340 --> 02:23:25,420
Guy dude Family Guy this season has not been funny I don't think great I don't

1745
02:23:25,420 --> 02:23:28,940
know if we have we been watching the same show Family Guy is a great show

1746
02:23:28,940 --> 02:23:32,460
don't get me wrong but the last two episodes this season have been stupid

1747
02:23:32,460 --> 02:23:34,460
They have been absolutely stupid.

1748
02:23:34,460 --> 02:23:36,460
I loved the last episode. That was great.

1749
02:23:36,460 --> 02:23:39,460
One more day and I would have jumped your bones.

1750
02:23:39,460 --> 02:23:46,460
I got linked to a disturbing TV Tokyo page for an anime called Ice Shield 21.

1751
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:49,460
It's about American football.

1752
02:23:49,460 --> 02:23:50,460
Huh.

1753
02:23:50,460 --> 02:23:53,460
I find that hilarious and I oddly want to see it.

1754
02:23:53,460 --> 02:23:55,460
Hmm.

1755
02:23:55,460 --> 02:23:58,460
Alright, we're going to go to a break. We're going to do just some random music this break.

1756
02:23:58,460 --> 02:24:03,260
this break we don't really have a whole lot a big theme to this break but I want

1757
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:06,100
to play some Vincent D'amore so I know I'm putting that in there we're gonna

1758
02:24:06,100 --> 02:24:09,640

02:24:09,640 --> 02:24:14,860

1761
02:24:19,140 --> 02:24:23,740

1762
02:24:23,740 --> 02:24:26,360

1763
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:33,360
back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

1764
02:24:56,360 --> 02:24:58,360
Oh

1765
02:25:56,360 --> 02:25:58,360
Oh

Love All Truth, this is what I prove, between me and you, oh hoh oh oh

1768
02:28:14,640 --> 02:28:25,100
Love All Truth, each and all you choose, is for me and you, oh hoh oh oh

1769
02:28:55,100 --> 02:28:55,600
Uh

1770
02:29:25,100 --> 02:29:32,120
You know the way you and I gotta be

1771
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:34,120
You and I gotta be

1772
02:31:32,120 --> 02:31:35,400
I'm the main ju maker guy

1773
02:31:36,060 --> 02:31:38,520
I said that I am the chill

1774
02:31:38,520 --> 02:31:41,320
I am the main ju maker guy

1775
02:31:41,720 --> 02:31:45,300
Well, hello, hello, hello, hello, I am the chill

1776
02:31:45,360 --> 02:31:48,180
I am the main ju maker guy

1777
02:31:49,540 --> 02:31:51,740
I said that I am the chill

1778
02:31:51,740 --> 02:31:56,200
I am the main ju maker guy

1779
02:31:58,760 --> 02:32:00,940
Mr. Random person on the street who by the way

1780
02:32:00,940 --> 02:32:04,940
is not an actor. What do you think of the Orange Lounge Baymani Music & More show?

1781
02:32:04,940 --> 02:32:14,940
The music is like being transported to just this dancing spaceship place. It's unearthly.

1782
02:32:14,940 --> 02:32:18,940
It's like being in a club, except you don't have to ask someone to dance.

1783
02:32:18,940 --> 02:32:25,940
Alright, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio. Here we are, another show almost to a close.

1784
02:32:25,940 --> 02:32:32,060
a good half hour of show left and we got still the FUs to get to and all sorts of other stuff

1785
02:32:32,060 --> 02:32:40,940
as well. First off though, what I wanted to do, I was gonna, oh man, I was trying to find

1786
02:32:40,940 --> 02:32:51,820
this sound file I had. If you're doing what I think you're doing, you can just stop it.

1787
02:32:51,820 --> 02:32:52,820
Stop it!

1788
02:32:52,820 --> 02:32:55,820
I don't know where it went, I'm so sad.

1789
02:32:55,820 --> 02:32:58,260
Oh, darn, darn.

1790
02:32:58,260 --> 02:33:02,940
I only have the version where it goes, hey, Loki, what do you think about gay sex, and

1791
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:03,940
it's so much fun.

1792
02:33:03,940 --> 02:33:07,060
But anyway, no, what happened during the break, it was really funny, I guess you had to be

1793
02:33:07,060 --> 02:33:11,840
there, but Extrofer asked Jamie, asked DarkSakura, how's World of Warcraft going?

1794
02:33:11,840 --> 02:33:14,580
And Jamie goes, it's so much fun.

1795
02:33:14,580 --> 02:33:18,020
And then we all started giggling, and Loki's like, shut up.

1796
02:33:18,020 --> 02:33:21,540
I was being serious, it really is a lot of fun.

1797
02:33:21,540 --> 02:33:26,620
but it's really funny. It's a lot better than Final Fantasy XI ever was. Ah, shut your piehole.

1798
02:33:26,620 --> 02:33:31,020
Alright. You've never played this. You don't know. I've seen it. You don't have to party with stupid people.

1799
02:33:31,020 --> 02:33:35,740
I don't trash on World of Warcraft though. I think it's okay. I just, you know, I'm

1800
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:39,900
obsessed with it. Well, no, no, no, no, no, because I'm very bitter toward Final Fantasy XI because of the

1801
02:33:39,900 --> 02:33:46,540
idiots. But, okay, it's like, hi, I'm gonna give you warning before I decide to buff everybody

1802
02:33:46,540 --> 02:33:51,380
and I'm half tempted that if, you know, I give you a 20 second delay to get there

1803
02:33:51,380 --> 02:33:57,880
before I cast the shit, and if they're not there, screw it, no haste for you.

1804
02:33:57,880 --> 02:33:58,880
You done?

1805
02:33:58,880 --> 02:33:59,880
Feel better?

1806
02:33:59,880 --> 02:34:00,880
No.

1807
02:34:00,880 --> 02:34:02,500
They make white mages bitches in that game.

1808
02:34:02,500 --> 02:34:07,140
We're gonna go from one, um, we're gonna go from one rant to another.

1809
02:34:07,140 --> 02:34:10,740
Uh, In the Groove, we have completely defaced this copy of In the Groove, extra for you

1810
02:34:10,740 --> 02:34:12,740
actually need to add something to this too.

1811
02:34:12,740 --> 02:34:13,740
Inside now.

1812
02:34:13,740 --> 02:34:14,740
This has been defaced, huh?

1813
02:34:14,740 --> 02:34:16,740
Doesn't he really need to add something?

1814
02:34:16,740 --> 02:34:19,780
There's just a name or something, so that all sorts of Orange Lounge personalities are

1815
02:34:19,780 --> 02:34:20,780
represented here.

1816
02:34:20,780 --> 02:34:26,540
Garrett has defaced this, Bug defaced it, Loki, myself, and DarkSakura of course all

1817
02:34:26,540 --> 02:34:30,740
defaced this copy. Things just written all over this. This game sucks monkey

1818
02:34:30,740 --> 02:34:36,140
balls. Actually, Loki signed it at least twice. I don't know why that is. DarkSakura

1819
02:34:36,140 --> 02:34:39,400
drew an artistic interpretation in the middle. We wrote all over the

1820
02:34:39,400 --> 02:34:42,380
instruction manual. We are going to be giving this away to a lucky listener.

1821
02:34:42,380 --> 02:34:48,180
Alright, and here it is. This is how you enter the contest. It's the Orange Lounge

1826
02:35:07,980 --> 02:35:12,500
one little catch Jamie tell them about the catch it's not in traditional haiku

1827
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:20,580
format first of all it was sort of your first line must be five syllables your

1828
02:35:20,580 --> 02:35:26,380
second line must be seven syllables and your last line must be three ah so

1829
02:35:26,380 --> 02:35:32,500
instead of five seven five you have to do a five seven three hi cool we call

1830
02:35:32,500 --> 02:35:36,820
this the olr format yes the olr format and if you catch on to what five seven

1854
02:37:35,940 --> 02:37:43,060
so it's time to do the FUs of the week. The FUs of the week and huh? Oh, you

1855
02:37:43,060 --> 02:37:45,340
want to know the cage match winner? I suppose we should do that as well, shouldn't we?

1856
02:37:45,340 --> 02:37:52,860
Oh, I always forget to do the cage match winner. Tonight's cage match winner was

1857
02:37:52,860 --> 02:37:59,340
kind of a landslide. Shouldn't be a surprise with this crowd that V by

1858
02:37:59,340 --> 02:38:07,340
Dorsaria wins tonight's cage match because you guys are whores for V. Tools, all of you.

1859
02:38:07,340 --> 02:38:19,220
Sheep. You're all a bunch of sheep. Alright, so Dorisia goes into rotation all week long

1860
02:38:19,220 --> 02:38:22,820
and the two of us, DarkSakura and I, have to come up with something new for next week,

1861
02:38:22,820 --> 02:38:26,620
so we'll see. Alright, let's get into the FUs of the Week. DarkSakura, why is it that

1862
02:38:26,620 --> 02:38:30,060
have to do the FUs of the Week every single week and send yours in over private message

1863
02:38:30,060 --> 02:38:44,060
right now if you want yours read. Because of Loki's vMix. That's my week. A big FU just

1864
02:38:44,060 --> 02:38:49,940
being stuck by myself while my man's off in Texas. I wish my job would send me to Texas

1865
02:38:49,940 --> 02:38:58,380
randomly. Um, so that I'm like, you know, not anywhere near California. Um, SU goes

1866
02:38:58,380 --> 02:39:04,380
to jury duty sort of halfway because I actually wanted to go so that I could sleep in about

1867
02:39:04,380 --> 02:39:09,500
two hours more than normal. And, uh, no, I have to go to work and then check back at

1868
02:39:09,500 --> 02:39:15,660
11 to see if I have to go. I get to go the week after. Good for you. I bet you feel special.

1869
02:39:15,660 --> 02:39:20,100
I hate it, but I want to get put on like a really interesting case or

1870
02:39:20,660 --> 02:39:25,820
Like one that has like a lot of forensic evidence for me to mull over to stuff like that interests me

1871
02:39:25,900 --> 02:39:29,700
Or like real estate stuff because I actually studied real estate law

1872
02:39:29,700 --> 02:39:33,500
So I know what to do with that or mortgage law because that would totally be me

1873
02:39:34,980 --> 02:39:38,380
But I don't want to be I don't even mind having a serial murder case

1874
02:39:38,840 --> 02:39:43,580
Because serial murderers have like specific criteria they look for in their victims

1875
02:39:43,580 --> 02:39:47,320
But if it's like some really rich and powerful person, I don't want to do that because then

1876
02:39:47,320 --> 02:39:52,140
they hunt down the jury, or they're convicted for being morons.

1877
02:39:52,140 --> 02:39:54,260
I really want to nail a stupid person, though.

1878
02:39:54,260 --> 02:39:58,420
I want to be on the jury for someone who did something really stupid, because they go,

1879
02:39:58,420 --> 02:40:00,420
ah, you're stupid, guilty.

1880
02:40:00,420 --> 02:40:08,740
Um, F.U. to, uh, and I hate saying F.U. to my man because I love him so much, but after

1881
02:40:08,740 --> 02:40:16,380
me being so lonely and missing him so much, he comes home and wakes my ass up by banging

1882
02:40:16,380 --> 02:40:20,900
on the metal door and then fusses at me, accusing me of not doing the dishes, which I did the

1883
02:40:20,900 --> 02:40:26,340
dishes three times while he was gone, okay, and then, just because I had company last

1884
02:40:26,340 --> 02:40:32,620
night, and then, and then, I'm, you know, doing homework, and he, no, he says he's taking

1885
02:40:32,620 --> 02:40:37,060
a shower, so I start doing my homework, and then he's gone, I don't know where he is,

1886
02:40:37,060 --> 02:40:39,260
So I finished my homework, I played with my puppies.

1887
02:40:39,260 --> 02:40:41,420
I get started on working on another project,

1888
02:40:41,420 --> 02:40:42,260
and then he comes up and says,

1889
02:40:42,260 --> 02:40:44,340
oh yeah, I told you I was going across the street.

1890
02:40:44,340 --> 02:40:45,260
No, you didn't!

1891
02:40:45,260 --> 02:40:48,060
And if you did, you need to make sure that I heard you.

1892
02:40:48,060 --> 02:40:50,380
And then he says, you would come play Madden with us.

1893
02:40:50,380 --> 02:40:53,480
And I hate American football more than anything,

1894
02:40:53,480 --> 02:40:55,380
just about, except for idiots,

1895
02:40:55,380 --> 02:40:58,020
because most of the time it really is,

1896
02:40:58,020 --> 02:41:02,160
I think a football, and I think a big, fat, ugly,

1897
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:05,360
buttooth rednecks, you know, the stereotypical redneck,

1898
02:41:05,360 --> 02:41:11,040
drinking a beer, you know, drinking a bud or a Coors, something nasty, you know, in

1899
02:41:11,040 --> 02:41:17,940
a wife beater and, you know, torn up jeans or shorts or like boxers or something. I have

1900
02:41:17,940 --> 02:41:22,600
this mental image because I have actually seen it multiple times in different places,

1901
02:41:22,600 --> 02:41:30,600
usually in Mississippi. Um, so yeah, I, I can't, I was so mad. And then I come here

1902
02:41:30,600 --> 02:41:33,600
And then I still don't have my game.

1903
02:41:36,600 --> 02:41:37,600
Which irks me.

1904
02:41:37,600 --> 02:41:38,600
The K game.

1905
02:41:38,600 --> 02:41:39,600
The K game.

1906
02:41:39,600 --> 02:41:40,600
Kalamari.

1907
02:41:40,600 --> 02:41:43,600
Na na na na na na na.

1908
02:41:43,600 --> 02:41:44,600
Reee!

1909
02:41:44,600 --> 02:41:46,600
Dot dot dot.

1910
02:41:46,600 --> 02:41:52,600
And then, and then I really want, uh, Dirge of, uh, Cerberus delayed.

1911
02:41:52,600 --> 02:41:54,600
The beta test got delayed.

1912
02:41:54,600 --> 02:41:56,600
So that means it's gonna be delayed even more.

1913
02:41:56,600 --> 02:41:59,600
And I don't really give a crap about online content because I want Vincent Eye Candy.

1914
02:41:59,600 --> 02:42:02,600
candy. The end.

1915
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:34,880
turn on a four-way stop and I go through there and dumb old guy slows down

1916
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:39,800
briefly and then goes nearly like rear-ending my car so then I'm pulling

1917
02:42:39,800 --> 02:42:44,840
up to the stop the next stop sign which is a two you know a three-way stop and

1918
02:42:44,840 --> 02:42:49,240
dumbass pulls up next to me there is no other lane there's only one lane and he's

1919
02:42:49,240 --> 02:42:54,280
trying to create his own lane and so I go and he goes right next to me thus

1920
02:42:54,280 --> 02:42:58,600
creating his own lane I guess because he's old and stupid his car sucked so

1921
02:42:58,600 --> 02:43:03,960
So fuck you to old people because you can't drive and you need to be off the road.

1922
02:43:03,960 --> 02:43:06,320
And you're not the only old person that's done this.

1923
02:43:06,320 --> 02:43:09,380
There are other old people that drive too slow, other old people that don't look at

1924
02:43:09,380 --> 02:43:10,520
where they're going.

1925
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:15,620
Whenever I see a car on the road, it's of one of a couple criteria.

1926
02:43:15,620 --> 02:43:19,640
Woman or old person or an old woman, which is the worst.

1927
02:43:19,640 --> 02:43:21,820
The bigger the hair, the slower they drive.

1928
02:43:21,820 --> 02:43:25,940
So yeah.

1929
02:43:25,940 --> 02:43:30,340
I do have to say that there was a guy probably about in his early twenties.

1930
02:43:30,340 --> 02:43:34,300
There's this one intersection by Red Robin going on sunrise for anyone who lives in the

1931
02:43:34,300 --> 02:43:35,240
area

1932
02:43:35,240 --> 02:43:39,240
where you have two left turn lanes, you know, one of them turns right and can go

1933
02:43:39,240 --> 02:43:40,500
straight to

1934
02:43:40,500 --> 02:43:42,620
and then there's actually

1935
02:43:42,620 --> 02:43:44,420
two

1936
02:43:44,420 --> 02:43:46,500
left lanes.

1937
02:43:46,500 --> 02:43:52,620
Well the guy pulls into the opposite traffic lane as a turn lane

1938
02:43:52,620 --> 02:43:57,620
And we roll down the window and go, um, hey, you, over here, and he's like driving like a Camaro.

1939
02:43:58,620 --> 02:43:59,620
My favorite...

1940
02:44:00,620 --> 02:44:01,620
It was no bitchin' Camaro.

1941
02:44:02,620 --> 02:44:03,620
It was a guy.

1942
02:44:04,620 --> 02:44:11,620
My favorite, though, is the guy that said, you know, pull up, we're in the left turn lane, okay, there's only a left turn lane, and, you know, a lane that goes straight and right.

1943
02:44:12,620 --> 02:44:19,620
And this guy pulls up into oncoming traffic, goes to the left of the left turn lane, and makes a left turn, all when the light's just green to go straight.

1944
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:25,620
It's like, holy crap, you just completely ignored every single traffic law right there.

1945
02:44:25,620 --> 02:44:30,620
I had another lady today in her van pull straight through the red, um, through the stop sign.

1946
02:44:30,620 --> 02:44:34,620
Just didn't even slow down, just went 50 miles an hour through the stop sign.

1947
02:44:34,620 --> 02:44:36,620
Three hour show, Loki.

1948
02:44:39,620 --> 02:44:46,620
Okay, Rob, I'm going to talk really fast then.

1949
02:44:46,620 --> 02:44:53,620
so my other F U was to screaming kids in the movie last night. The end.

1950
02:45:16,620 --> 02:45:26,620
FU to Loki for being a jackass, FU to Renee in chatroom for calling me a liar. I hope your copy of EX2 is scratched and doesn't work. Just kidding, heart.

1951
02:45:26,620 --> 02:45:38,620
FU to this pink thing that I have on my desk. I don't even know what it is, but I always want to play with it. I don't know why.

1952
02:45:38,620 --> 02:45:41,620
You know how they have training wheels? That's a training cock ring.

1953
02:45:41,620 --> 02:45:45,620
No, this is not a training cock ring, and this would never fit.

1954
02:45:45,620 --> 02:45:47,620
This is, it was on a CD spindle, I think.

1955
02:45:47,620 --> 02:45:48,620
That's why it's so small.

1956
02:45:48,620 --> 02:45:51,620
That's what it is, and I can't stop playing with it, it's smooshy.

1957
02:45:51,620 --> 02:45:55,620
I should send this to a contest winner, so it's out of my house.

1958
02:45:55,620 --> 02:45:57,620
Maybe I'll do that.

1959
02:45:57,620 --> 02:45:58,620
You can play with this, too.

1960
02:45:58,620 --> 02:46:04,620
My finger's been in this hole, I don't know how many times.

1961
02:46:04,620 --> 02:46:05,620
Do you want to sign it?

1962
02:46:05,620 --> 02:46:06,620
I have sharpies.

1963
02:46:06,620 --> 02:46:11,620
Somebody's going to cut that little clip of the show and make a YTMND out of it.

1964
02:46:11,620 --> 02:46:15,620
Yeah, low-key.

1965
02:46:15,620 --> 02:46:18,620
I should send that to a random listener.

1966
02:46:18,620 --> 02:46:23,620
Anyway, let's see, what else do I have in FU?

1967
02:46:23,620 --> 02:46:28,620
I'm not going to sign it and give it away. It's my pink thing. The listeners can get their own pink thing.

1968
02:46:28,620 --> 02:46:31,620
I bet you many of them do.

1969
02:46:31,620 --> 02:46:36,220
uh...

1970
02:46:36,220 --> 02:46:38,580

i don't want to clean

1974
02:46:43,580 --> 02:46:45,080
cleaning sucks

1975
02:46:45,080 --> 02:46:47,640
i want a robot the cleans for me

1976
02:46:47,640 --> 02:46:50,120

What's your F.U. this week?

1982
02:47:02,140 --> 02:47:06,320
F.U. to the giant scratch somebody put in my hood Thursday night when I was in San

1983
02:47:06,320 --> 02:47:09,780
Jose getting blasted off my ass

1984
02:47:09,780 --> 02:47:13,300
at the tide house for a birthday party.

1985
02:47:13,300 --> 02:47:17,100
Second F.U. to maximum tune at UC Davis for

1986
02:47:17,100 --> 02:47:20,780
gleefully accepting my card and then telling me, hey, drop three more bucks

1987
02:47:20,780 --> 02:47:26,260
and we'll import your card data to another card that'll work with our machine.

1988
02:47:26,260 --> 02:47:28,380
Yeah, right.

1989
02:47:28,380 --> 02:47:31,940
And a F.U. for Netflix for not working damn faster.

1990
02:47:31,940 --> 02:47:36,940
I want that movie the next fucking day, not the day after.

1991
02:47:36,940 --> 02:47:39,220
Use wormholes or some shit like that.

1992
02:47:39,220 --> 02:47:41,700
That's it.

1993
02:47:41,700 --> 02:47:43,100
Alright.

1994
02:47:43,100 --> 02:47:44,260
Garrett.

1995
02:47:44,260 --> 02:47:51,380
Um, an F.U. to eBears who sell forged autographs on items.

1996
02:47:51,380 --> 02:47:55,380
Oh, that was short and sweet.

1997
02:47:55,380 --> 02:47:56,380
Extrovert.

1998
02:47:56,380 --> 02:48:03,380
Um, f you to guys that say the exact wrong thing during sex.

1999
02:48:04,380 --> 02:48:10,380
Okay. Okay, you want the story? Okay then, Xtifer.

2000
02:48:10,380 --> 02:48:17,380
Sure, Xtifer. Tell us all about your sex, or I'm sorry, of sex that your friend had.

2001
02:48:17,380 --> 02:48:24,080
Well, we were busy having sex, and he says- Oh, look at that! Look at that! We just lost

2002
02:48:24,080 --> 02:48:29,080
Oh, oh, no problem. No, I'm still talking.

2003
02:48:29,080 --> 02:48:34,080
I'm sorry, I forgot this was the extrovert show. My bad.

2004
02:48:34,080 --> 02:48:42,080
Well, thanks for remembering. No, so basically he stops as we're into it and he says something like,

2005
02:48:42,080 --> 02:48:47,080
yeah, so I'm not in the mood for getting into a relationship right now.

2006
02:48:47,080 --> 02:48:52,080
And I looked at him and I said, why are you going to say something stupid like that while we're having sex?

2007
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:54,280
I'm like, sex is stupid.

2008
02:48:54,280 --> 02:48:56,000
You don't have a brain when you're having sex.

2009
02:48:56,000 --> 02:48:57,220
You don't think.

2010
02:48:57,220 --> 02:48:59,160
You don't say things that you think of.

2011
02:48:59,160 --> 02:49:00,460
I'm like, unless they're dirty.

2012
02:49:00,460 --> 02:49:01,460
You say dirty things.

2013
02:49:01,460 --> 02:49:03,600
I mean, I can think of very many dirty things.

2014
02:49:03,600 --> 02:49:06,600
I can probably say a bunch of them right now if I wanted to.

2015
02:49:06,600 --> 02:49:07,600
Sure, why not?

2016
02:49:07,600 --> 02:49:08,600
Yes.

2017
02:49:08,600 --> 02:49:09,600
Dishes.

2018
02:49:09,600 --> 02:49:10,600
Sure, give us an example.

2019
02:49:10,600 --> 02:49:11,600
Why not?

2020
02:49:11,600 --> 02:49:12,600
The listeners are already scared as it is.

2021
02:49:12,600 --> 02:49:17,360
You know, like the normals, suck my cock, you know, stick your tongue up my ass, you

2022
02:49:17,360 --> 02:49:19,840
know, stuff like that.

2023
02:49:19,840 --> 02:49:26,020
But you know, you don't want to say something that's actually, you know, somewhat conversation,

2024
02:49:26,020 --> 02:49:28,160
you know, starting.

2025
02:49:28,160 --> 02:49:32,760
I got limp, okay?

2026
02:49:32,760 --> 02:49:38,840
It's very difficult for me to talk about something like that during sex, and so I, you know,

2027
02:49:38,840 --> 02:49:44,840
fuck you to that, to him.

2028
02:49:44,840 --> 02:49:47,640

2077
02:53:40,360 --> 02:53:43,680
Brought to you by Orange Lounge Radio. Loki, what's on your mind?

2078
02:53:43,680 --> 02:53:50,240
Um, I'm tired of the cheese. I kind of want to eat the rest of it, but it's getting even

2079
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:55,480
harder. And, uh, but there's not much left. You remember how much it came in with? That

2080
02:53:55,480 --> 02:54:00,120
is all that's left. Did you have to hold brick when you came in here? I had half of it. Are

2081
02:54:00,120 --> 02:54:03,120
Are you worried about having a heart bypass when you're 30?

2082
02:54:03,120 --> 02:54:04,120
No?

2083
02:54:04,120 --> 02:54:05,120
Just curious.

2084
02:54:05,120 --> 02:54:07,120
Are you 25 yet?

2085
02:54:07,120 --> 02:54:08,120
Yes.

2086
02:54:08,120 --> 02:54:10,880
Okay, then you don't have to wait until 25 for that.

2087
02:54:10,880 --> 02:54:12,440
He just turned 25 a few.

2088
02:54:12,440 --> 02:54:13,440
That's right, last week.

2089
02:54:13,440 --> 02:54:15,840
His birthday is September 11th, so.

2090
02:54:15,840 --> 02:54:16,840
Lucky guy.

2091
02:54:16,840 --> 02:54:19,560
All right, well, damn, I'm out of topics.

2092
02:54:19,560 --> 02:54:21,280
Let me scan.

2093
02:54:21,280 --> 02:54:23,280
I'm sure I missed something here on orangelaundryradio.com.

2094
02:54:23,280 --> 02:54:26,580
Give me a moment here.

2095
02:54:26,580 --> 02:54:27,580
Ask Orange Laundry.

2096
02:54:27,580 --> 02:54:28,580
We only have five minutes left.

2097
02:54:28,580 --> 02:54:31,580
Okay, if we get a couple quick questions, we'll do some Ask Orange Lounge.

2098
02:54:31,580 --> 02:54:34,580
Hurry up and send a question over to orangeloungeloungeradio.com.

2099
02:54:34,580 --> 02:54:37,580
Oh, I wanted to add this. I guess we can throw this out there.

2100
02:54:37,580 --> 02:54:41,580
We have a MySpace now. I guess we can promote this, right? Why not?

2101
02:54:41,580 --> 02:54:43,580
Yeah, I was going to do it.

2102
02:54:43,580 --> 02:54:46,580
Well, Terry's going to turn it over to you, right? Or something. He said he would.

2103
02:54:46,580 --> 02:54:50,580
So, we are actually discontinuing.

2104
02:54:50,580 --> 02:54:54,580
For those of you guys that are in our 1UP Club, due to lack of activity

2105
02:54:54,580 --> 02:54:58,200
the fact that we're going to actually be leaving, or at least I'm going to be leaving my blog

2106
02:54:58,200 --> 02:55:00,900
on 1up.com for another project pretty soon.

2107
02:55:00,900 --> 02:55:04,180
No disrespect to the folks there, but we're going to discontinue our club there.

2108
02:55:04,180 --> 02:55:05,180
I never used mine.

2109
02:55:05,180 --> 02:55:07,780
Yeah, so we're discontinuing our club at 1up.com.

2110
02:55:07,780 --> 02:55:11,100
Instead, now we have a MySpace.

2111
02:55:11,100 --> 02:55:15,920
And MySpace I know we've joked about sometimes is where the internet goes to die, because

2112
02:55:15,920 --> 02:55:17,120
in some ways it is.

2113
02:55:17,120 --> 02:55:18,880
It is.

2114
02:55:18,880 --> 02:55:21,820
And why is it the place where the internet goes to die?

2115
02:55:21,820 --> 02:55:23,660
Your sister's MySpace.

2116
02:55:23,660 --> 02:55:26,940
My sister's Myspace is god awful, it is.

2117
02:55:26,940 --> 02:55:27,940
That is a very good example.

2118
02:55:27,940 --> 02:55:34,420
She has like little pictures of Satan like spinning around and stuff.

2119
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:40,740
But yeah, anyway, we actually have a brand new club on Myspace.

2120
02:55:40,740 --> 02:55:42,020
I'm just trying to find the URL.

2121
02:55:42,020 --> 02:55:46,300
I think it's Myspace.com slash Orange Lounge, but I'm just kind of trying to make sure of

2122
02:55:46,300 --> 02:55:47,300
that here.

2123
02:55:47,300 --> 02:55:48,300
Shoot.

2124
02:55:48,300 --> 02:55:50,300
There we go.

2125
02:55:50,300 --> 02:55:56,420
There we go, yes, it's groups.myspace.com slash OrangeLoungeRadio, so if you're a Myspace

2126
02:55:56,420 --> 02:56:00,680
whore, like the rest of us, you can actually join our club on Myspace.

2127
02:56:00,680 --> 02:56:05,700
And I don't know what we're going to do with the Myspace club, but we'll do clubby things.

2128
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:06,700
Okay?

2129
02:56:06,700 --> 02:56:07,700
Like baby seal clubs?

2130
02:56:07,700 --> 02:56:14,220
Yeah, we'll go and drink a lot and listen to Blur, and you said club things.

2131
02:56:14,220 --> 02:56:15,220
Yeah, I know.

2132
02:56:15,220 --> 02:56:17,220
I like the baby seal clubs.

2133
02:56:17,220 --> 02:56:19,420
We'll club you, actually, if you join this club.

2134
02:56:19,420 --> 02:56:24,420
Oh, cool. Well, maybe do a special giveaway for the club or something, but we want to have a MySpace page.

2135
02:56:24,420 --> 02:56:32,420
Actually, something we thought about is maybe we actually should have an actual artist page so we can put songs on it, and it could be clips of the show or something.

2136
02:56:32,420 --> 02:56:35,420
So we thought about doing that, too. So maybe Dark Soccer, you can work on that one.

2137
02:56:35,420 --> 02:56:36,420
It's so cool.

2138
02:56:36,420 --> 02:56:37,420
Work on that end of it.

2139
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:38,420
Maybe.

2140
02:56:38,420 --> 02:56:39,420
Maybe.

2141
02:56:39,420 --> 02:56:42,420
And, of course, I have my Loki Fusion page on MySpace.

2142
02:56:42,420 --> 02:56:44,420
Yes, you do. Hoard that out, because it's been a little while.

2143
02:56:44,420 --> 02:56:48,420
uh... myspace dot com slash lowkey fusion and uh...

2144
02:56:48,420 --> 02:56:51,900
i need to add some more stuff to it. I have a couple songs on there

2145
02:56:51,900 --> 02:56:54,900
but some stuff that you might not be able to find or you know

2146
02:56:54,900 --> 02:56:58,500
because a lot of my mp3's are out there but it's hard to find now so

2147
02:56:58,500 --> 02:57:00,860
they're up there, some of them

2148
02:57:00,860 --> 02:57:03,700
alright we're actually getting some questions for ask orange lounge we don't

2149
02:57:03,700 --> 02:57:06,540
have much time left in the show so we're gonna go ahead and get into these

2150
02:57:06,540 --> 02:57:07,700
questions

2151
02:57:07,700 --> 02:57:14,700
uh... so we can wrap this shit up

2152
02:57:17,900 --> 02:57:19,660
let's ask orange lounge

2153
02:57:19,660 --> 02:57:21,300
some stupid question

2154
02:57:21,300 --> 02:57:25,940
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio i hope if you had a

2155
02:57:25,940 --> 02:57:30,860
question you already sent it in because i'm cutting the rest of you off because

2156
02:57:30,860 --> 02:57:32,740
we're going to be overtime

2157
02:57:32,740 --> 02:57:35,620
alright uh...

2158
02:57:35,620 --> 02:57:45,320
Renee, first, just a quick comment. The Ultramix 3 song pack medley sounds like what you'd hear in different phases of a climatic final boss fight.

2159
02:57:45,320 --> 02:57:52,720
Now my question, what do you all believe is the mystery track after what's supposedly after the 250 BPM remix?

2160
02:57:52,720 --> 02:57:58,020
I honestly have no idea. I've listened to that thing and I just, I don't, I don't know.

2161
02:57:58,020 --> 02:58:02,620
strong jaeger i could probably ask somebody and probably find out but i

2162
02:58:02,620 --> 02:58:06,100
don't think that they'd appreciate me sharing that information right now so

2163
02:58:06,100 --> 02:58:07,540
it was a strong jaeger

2164
02:58:07,540 --> 02:58:11,140
or uh... i think it's something that i think it's something l-e-d maybe it's

2165
02:58:11,140 --> 02:58:15,220
like big voyager

2166
02:58:15,220 --> 02:58:18,420
you heard garrett says he's heard strong he stirred up a strong anger in there

2167
02:58:18,420 --> 02:58:20,660
definitely

2168
02:58:20,660 --> 02:58:23,800
i thought you guys said vinj and jae was in there and i thought they were like

2169
02:58:23,800 --> 02:58:26,340
mashing it all up with something else but i thought i heard the bass from that and that

2170
02:58:26,340 --> 02:58:40,340
I thought the two things that were in there were, because someone was saying there's five tracks, and it was 250 BPM, being from Denjin J, Love Me Do, Outer Limits, and then another remix of Love Me Do was my guess. Not in exactly that order.

2171
02:58:40,340 --> 02:58:55,340
Alright. Well, we'll see. Anyway, we gotta get to some other questions here. Rene's second question. What would you do for a Klondike bar? Eat it. No, what would you do for a Klondike bar? You can't eat it until you've done something for it.

2172
02:58:55,340 --> 02:58:57,340
I would eat another Klondike bar.

2173
02:58:57,340 --> 02:58:59,340
Um, I wouldn't eat a Klondike bar.

2174
02:58:59,340 --> 02:59:01,340
Me either.

2175
02:59:01,340 --> 02:59:05,340
That's it, I gotta go buy Klondike bars now, thank you very much.

2176
02:59:05,340 --> 02:59:10,340
Legend of Zaku says, I have an LCD TV now, I need some cool shit to do with it.

2177
02:59:10,340 --> 02:59:11,340
Um...

2178
02:59:11,340 --> 02:59:12,340
Kill it!

2179
02:59:12,340 --> 02:59:13,340
Give it to me!

2180
02:59:13,340 --> 02:59:15,340
Lower it and put a spoiler on it.

2181
02:59:15,340 --> 02:59:17,340
Play Atari 2600 on it.

2182
02:59:17,340 --> 02:59:23,340
Sakurina says, what does the Poppin' Music whore think of the new Bomani logo on Poppin' 13?

2183
02:59:23,340 --> 02:59:29,340
I have no idea, really. I don't know. I think the interface looks like shit in Pop Music 13.

2184
02:59:29,340 --> 02:59:35,340
Nintendo Maniac 64 says, why do you like to deprive us easterners of sleep?

2185
02:59:35,340 --> 02:59:37,340
That's your own fucking fault.

2186
02:59:37,340 --> 02:59:39,340
In all seriousness...

2187
02:59:39,340 --> 02:59:42,340
Why do they like to deprive us of our morning here?

2188
02:59:42,340 --> 02:59:48,340
Yeah, if we did the show any earlier, we'd be cutting into the rest of our weekends, so we really can't.

2189
02:59:48,340 --> 02:59:51,220
uh... e there's just

2190
02:59:51,220 --> 02:59:55,420
you're screwed i'm sorry i i really wish i had some better news for you but uh...

02:59:55,420 --> 02:59:59,700

I'm not sure when they do own on freak. Yeah on Fridays

2199
03:00:20,940 --> 03:00:28,400
Nintendo maniac 64 also wants to know why doesn't my Numa mp3 work in wmp. It doesn't want to play that song because it's horde

2200
03:00:29,900 --> 03:00:34,900
I'm assuming that's wmp. I'm one I'm saying that's Numa Numa a probably. I don't know

2201
03:00:36,580 --> 03:00:43,500
John Field says given your recent issues with show timing are there any considerations of expanding the show another half an hour to an hour?

2202
03:00:43,500 --> 03:00:50,060
Only if you'd like to wake up and do my job for me in the morning?

2203
03:00:50,060 --> 03:00:54,260
I don't know if that's... he might be talking about Orange Lounge to Go, because Orange

2204
03:00:54,260 --> 03:00:58,720
Lounge to Go is supposed to be 30 minutes, but it's been going an hour. Orange Lounge

2205
03:00:58,720 --> 03:01:04,000
to Go goes however long we feel like, basically. But this one, no. No way.

2206
03:01:04,000 --> 03:01:07,640
This particular show, no, because we taped the podcast right after this show, so there's

2207
03:01:07,640 --> 03:01:10,680
no way we could expand the show. In fact, if anything, we'd want to cut back this show

2208
03:01:10,680 --> 03:01:16,680
to make our podcast longer, but we're not going to do that at any time soon. No plans

2209
03:01:16,680 --> 03:01:25,680
at this time. Tomokun says, Blu-ray or HD DVD? I want them both to come up with something

2210
03:01:25,680 --> 03:01:30,440
that's standard, so both work, because I don't want to buy two players, period. That's it.

2211
03:01:30,440 --> 03:01:31,840
You don't have to.

2212
03:01:31,840 --> 03:01:32,840
What?

2213
03:01:32,840 --> 03:01:33,840
JGB is making one of both.

2214
03:01:33,840 --> 03:01:40,000
Good. And lastly, Illusion wants to ask, where's Waldo?

2215
03:01:40,000 --> 03:01:49,400
Quebec having sex with extra fur I don't know I mean in a bunker in Iraq that's

2216
03:01:49,400 --> 03:01:55,520
the end of the show boys and girls final thought time extra for your final

2217
03:01:55,520 --> 03:02:03,680

2218
03:02:03,680 --> 03:02:06,240
final thought I'm thoughtless thanks for coming

2219
03:02:06,240 --> 03:02:08,240
He was.

2220
03:02:08,240 --> 03:02:10,240
That's not what he said.

2221
03:02:10,240 --> 03:02:12,240
He didn't say things for coffee.

2222
03:02:12,240 --> 03:02:14,240
Buggs, your final thought?

2223
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:16,240
Because it's Quebec.

2224
03:02:16,240 --> 03:02:18,240
Loki, your final thought?

2225
03:02:18,240 --> 03:02:20,240
I forgot to mention this earlier, but

2226
03:02:20,240 --> 03:02:24,240
fuck you to McDonald's for making shoddy cuffs that break open in my car.

2227
03:02:24,240 --> 03:02:26,240
Every time.

2228
03:02:26,240 --> 03:02:30,240
And my final thought is, um...

2229
03:02:30,240 --> 03:02:32,240
I still don't want to clean.

2230
03:02:32,240 --> 03:02:34,240
DarkSakura, your final thought?

2231
03:02:34,240 --> 03:02:39,740
Um, I want pancakes and reject false icons.

2232
03:02:39,740 --> 03:02:41,740
We need to go to Country Waffles.

2233
03:02:41,740 --> 03:02:43,240
I had Country Waffles today.

2234
03:02:43,240 --> 03:02:45,240
I have to have pancakes on a cheat day.

2235
03:02:45,240 --> 03:02:46,740
I went to Country Waffles today.

2236
03:02:46,740 --> 03:02:47,740
I hate you.

2237
03:02:47,740 --> 03:02:48,240
I love waffles.

2238
03:02:48,240 --> 03:02:49,740
I want a peanut butter banana waffle so bad.

2239
03:02:49,740 --> 03:02:51,740
I can have cheat day next month.

2240
03:02:51,740 --> 03:02:53,240
Alright.

2241
03:02:53,240 --> 03:02:57,240
Um, final word, one word of the show to sum it all up.

2242
03:02:57,240 --> 03:03:02,740
Don't forget kids, send in your haikus to win our copy of In the Groove 573 style.

2243
03:03:02,740 --> 03:03:07,020
Garrett, the Poppin' Music Whore, gets one word to sum up the whole show, the final word

2244
03:03:07,020 --> 03:03:10,740
of the night.

2245
03:03:10,740 --> 03:03:16,260

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2249
03:03:59,260 --> 03:04:08,260
Won't you climb up high, high through the sky and choose them all?

2250
03:04:09,260 --> 03:04:20,260
Cause they don't deserve to live, what did they ever give to you?

2251
03:04:20,260 --> 03:04:22,260
Na-na-na-na-na-na

2252
03:04:22,260 --> 03:04:26,260
What I want you to do, I want you to go upstairs to that apartment where that guy keeps playing that fairy tale

2253
03:04:26,260 --> 03:04:28,260
I could cook banana over and over and over again

2254
03:04:28,260 --> 03:04:30,260
I want you to ring the doorbell, nobody answers the door

2255
03:04:30,260 --> 03:04:32,260
I want you to stab him in the neck with a number two pencil

2256
03:04:32,260 --> 03:04:34,260
Over and over and over again, because he

2257
03:04:34,260 --> 03:04:36,260
must pay!

2258
03:04:36,260 --> 03:04:38,260
Shut him up and put him in the freezer as you leave the apartment

2259
03:04:38,260 --> 03:04:40,260
Light the place on fire!

2260
03:04:40,260 --> 03:04:42,260
Voices in my head

2261
03:04:42,260 --> 03:04:44,260
Please love

2262
03:04:44,260 --> 03:04:46,260
The voices in my head

2263
03:04:46,260 --> 03:04:48,260
Voices in my head

2264
03:04:48,260 --> 03:04:50,260
Please love

2265
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:52,260
The voices in my head

2266
03:04:52,260 --> 03:04:55,260
She dressed up like a clown

2267
03:05:00,260 --> 03:05:02,260
Bobby!

2268
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:07,260
Hi! You never called me back, I got the pictures back from Thanksgiving

2269
03:05:07,260 --> 03:05:10,260
I don't know why you wear that earring, if your father was alive, I don't know what he'd say

2270
03:05:10,260 --> 03:05:13,260
I was talking to Mrs. Corelli yesterday, you know Bobby Corelli was in your grave?

2271
03:05:13,260 --> 03:05:16,260
He got promoted again at his law firm, he's making $175,000 a year now

2272
03:05:16,260 --> 03:05:19,260
Are you on drugs? Why don't you ever call me back?

2273
03:05:19,260 --> 03:05:20,400
When are you gonna get married, son?

2274
03:05:20,520 --> 03:05:21,820
It's been about time you settled down

2275
03:05:21,820 --> 03:05:23,540
and got yourself a wife, got yourself a house

2276
03:05:23,540 --> 03:05:25,400
and got a kid and got a car and got a dog

2277
03:05:25,400 --> 03:05:27,220
and got a lawnmower and got a nice movie set

2278
03:05:27,220 --> 03:05:29,960
The voices in my head

2279
03:05:29,960 --> 03:05:31,760
Move on

2280
03:05:31,760 --> 03:05:33,360
The voices in my head

2281
03:05:33,620 --> 03:05:35,660
The voices in my head

2282
03:05:35,860 --> 03:05:37,540
Move on

2283
03:05:37,800 --> 03:05:43,680
The voices in my head

2284
03:05:43,780 --> 03:05:47,840
The voices in my head

2285
03:05:47,840 --> 03:06:00,840
Why, why is it every time I gotta win our fuckin' line?

2286
03:06:02,840 --> 03:06:07,840
Why is it every time I turn on my television set I gotta see Sally Struthers and those starving kids?

2287
03:06:07,840 --> 03:06:12,840
Why can't somebody just send her a chat and shut her and those goddamn kids off?

2288
03:06:12,840 --> 03:06:14,840
Where's Rob Reiner when you need him?

2289
03:06:14,840 --> 03:06:25,140
Why, why don't they drop the bomb right on top of everyone?

2290
03:06:27,440 --> 03:06:31,340
the voice in my head as I speak a home

2291
03:06:31,340 --> 03:06:36,940
the voice in my interest and my wisdom

2292
03:06:36,940 --> 03:06:41,660
the voice in my voice and my health

2293
03:06:41,660 --> 03:06:43,660
Operators standing by

2294
03:06:43,660 --> 03:06:45,140
Don't cry, don't, don't play no games

2295
03:06:45,160 --> 03:06:46,460
Is anybody else here there

2296
03:06:46,480 --> 03:06:47,660
Don't cry, don't, don't play no games

2297
03:06:47,680 --> 03:06:49,320
Is anybody else here

2298
03:06:49,340 --> 03:06:50,460
Is anybody else here

2299
03:06:50,480 --> 03:06:52,080
Is anybody else here

2300
03:06:52,100 --> 03:06:54,000
There's somebody else in the door

2301
03:06:54,020 --> 03:06:56,040
Is anybody else here

2302
03:06:56,060 --> 03:06:58,420
There's somebody else in the door

2303
03:06:58,440 --> 03:06:59,920
Is anybody else here

2304
03:06:59,940 --> 03:07:01,940
Is anybody else here

2305
03:07:01,960 --> 03:07:03,660
Is anybody else here

2306
03:07:03,680 --> 03:07:06,320
Stop, stop, stop with the singing!

2307
03:07:08,640 --> 03:07:09,420
Phew!

2308
03:07:09,420 --> 03:07:39,260
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2309
03:07:39,420 --> 03:07:48,420
Chat room is incessantly asking where they can download the vremix. Can they download that anywhere? Do they have to buy the diverse thing?

2310
03:07:48,420 --> 03:08:00,420
Well, if alt control delete was still up, they're having bandwidth issues right now, but there's a torrent on altcontroldelete.com. They have a whole diverse systems folder.

2311
03:08:00,420 --> 03:08:06,420
But that'd be where you'd find it. But until they come back, no. I don't know.

2312
03:08:06,420 --> 03:08:10,180
don't know all right thanks you guys tuning in and listening we're now going

2313
03:08:10,180 --> 03:08:14,060

2314
03:08:14,060 --> 03:08:19,300
