little picture a dark soccer right in the corner. Yeah and it's like an

01:12.200 --> 01:16.800
overhead shot because I was holding my phone up that way. It's an artsy shot. I was just

01:30.860 --> 01:37.660
get through yes that would happen being that we are having a little bit alcohol

01:37.660 --> 01:41.260
because there is a holiday weekend yes it's Labor Day weekend so we were doing

01:41.260 --> 01:44.760

01:47.980 --> 01:53.260
enjoying some drinks yeah technically the live show yeah well the ferret has

01:53.260 --> 01:58.900
something to say about that what's that thank you we have a podcast guest

01:58.900 --> 02:02.180
tonight we don't allow guests on the show very often so this guest is very

02:02.180 --> 02:07.820
very extra special first rule of podcast is do not talk about podcast say hello

02:07.820 --> 02:11.700
to Mel B is here tonight greetings everybody from the only sober one in

02:11.700 --> 02:16.460
this room so far how you doing Mel I'm doing that pretty good actually you know

02:16.460 --> 02:22.140
For those that may not know you why why are you an internet celebrity? We're gonna make all our podcast guests say this now

02:22.140 --> 02:23.940
Why are you an internet celebrity?

02:23.940 --> 02:28.700
Wow, I guess it happened all about five years ago when someone

02:29.260 --> 02:33.820
clicked on a link on a DDR site and saw a video of me dancing and

02:34.420 --> 02:37.060
like this is back when Dance Dance Revolution had a

02:37.340 --> 02:43.700
Freestyle and people were in the community and doing fun things and trying new things and it was basically it was kind of like Dance

02:43.700 --> 02:47.120
Dance Dance Revolution out in America just wasn't big at the time it was like a kind

02:47.120 --> 02:51.740
of a cult hit because people who were into like Japan gaming or just like anime or whatever

02:51.740 --> 02:56.820
or just rhythm games it just what there wasn't a big following so when there was internet

02:56.820 --> 03:00.700
stuff going on things being passed around it was like little did we know at the time

03:00.700 --> 03:05.200
it was a grassroots movement that was going to boom into something that became a multi-million

03:05.200 --> 03:11.000
dollar selling franchise so yeah I guess in a way people see me in the Dance Dance Revolution

03:11.000 --> 03:15.960
community as someone who kind of helped promote it helped you know make the game

03:15.960 --> 03:19.880
kind of fashionable to play I guess right on now you actually got to work on

03:19.880 --> 03:24.080
some of the DDR home releases right oh yes I did I worked in Konami digital

03:24.080 --> 03:27.960
entertainment over in Redwood City for about two years work in a lot of testing

03:27.960 --> 03:35.920
so I did have a hand in testing both Xbox versions um both in dance in

03:35.920 --> 03:40.920
Ultramix and Ultramix 2, did some stuff for Xtreme and among other things.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.920
Very cool, and any other game companies that you've had experience with?

03:43.920 --> 03:49.920
I had a cup of coffee with Namco for a couple months, you know, and that's really about it.

03:49.920 --> 03:53.920
Right now I'm not working in the game industry, but I'd definitely like to be back later.

03:53.920 --> 03:58.920
So, for a lot of our podcast listeners out there who listen to this, you know, they live all over the world,

03:58.920 --> 04:02.920
what's it like to work on the inside, working for the game company?

04:02.920 --> 04:08.520
It's kind of like almost any other job that you know, you kind of always dream about working, you know

04:08.520 --> 04:10.680
It's like anytime you hear a video game test and you think wow

04:10.680 --> 04:15.240
I get to play with games all day long that must be the most kickback job and to most extent

04:15.240 --> 04:19.400
Yes, it is a pretty kickback job. You know, it's like you get paid to do something you do pretty much

04:19.880 --> 04:23.680
You know something that you do at home sitting on your ass getting paid nothing, you know

04:23.840 --> 04:31.200
But it's as with any job there are positives and negatives negatives is man if you're like say a big fan of one game

04:31.200 --> 04:35.720
playing it 40 hours a week for eight weeks straight you're gonna learn to not

04:35.720 --> 04:39.760
like it as much. So you get a little burned out on DDR after playing it so

04:39.760 --> 04:44.400
much. Yeah you do and I mean there's just whole other you know types of things

04:44.400 --> 04:48.000
especially when you work in quality assurance but with any other job QA is

04:48.000 --> 04:52.040
sort of like you're the grunt of the company you know I mean a lot of people

04:52.040 --> 04:55.400
go into that thinking oh I can become a developer out of it or a producer and in

04:55.400 --> 04:58.440
some cases you can it just depends on the company I mean if it's a really huge

04:58.440 --> 05:03.960
company it's like you're one of like 250 300 people that are trying to you know

05:03.960 --> 05:07.360
jump ahead make that next step if you're in a smaller company chances are you

05:07.360 --> 05:11.920
know you do have a shot at making it so you know I'm not by no means discouraging

05:11.920 --> 05:15.160
anyone from doing anything I mean just do what you like and I like doing what I

05:15.160 --> 05:18.800
did have no regrets and like I said I'd like to be back sometime all right very

05:18.800 --> 05:21.760
cool any quick advice for somebody who wants to get their foot in the door in

05:21.760 --> 05:26.180
the game industry um it's really not that hard to get into testing really

05:26.180 --> 05:30.860
Essentially you just go on to corporate websites if you have a gaming company around in your area

05:30.860 --> 05:36.160
Especially like in whether you're in the Bay Area of California or you're in Southern California or like Florida or some places

05:36.380 --> 05:38.880
Just check out the corporate sites just get in testing

05:38.880 --> 05:43.400
I mean when you're going to the job interview just let them know like especially on your resume and stuff

05:43.560 --> 05:48.920
List down every single console that you've played talk about the types of games you are interested in talk about

05:49.320 --> 05:53.840
You know like games that you know you mastered, you know, because people like to know like wow

05:53.840 --> 05:58.560
There's you know, probably some hidden things that you found out that we thought no one else would and then you do you just learn basically

05:58.560 --> 06:03.500
That being a tester isn't just playing games. It's you're trying to break the game more than anything

06:03.500 --> 06:05.740
So you have to do all sorts of crazy stuff

06:05.740 --> 06:07.620
like if you're playing a

06:07.620 --> 06:12.420
Racing game you have to try driving backwards and see if you could crash the game because that's what you're paid to do

06:12.420 --> 06:17.320
You're paid to break the game. Very interesting. All right. Well for those of our listeners curious out there

06:17.320 --> 06:18.760
I'm sure that's some good advice

06:18.760 --> 06:22.800
So thank you for that and Mel B will be here throughout the show to just um

06:22.800 --> 06:27.480
Give his give his big fat opinion like we all do on the video games as we talked about tonight

06:27.520 --> 06:32.200
So we're gonna start off tonight show as we usually do talking about the games. We have been playing this week now dark soccer

06:32.200 --> 06:35.160
I know is a big week for you getting married and hitched and all that

06:35.560 --> 06:40.920
But I know you've at least been playing the puppies. So what do you been playing this week? I've been playing the puppies

06:42.280 --> 06:46.560
I just got my second dog tonight. My first one is a corgi named I'm

06:46.560 --> 06:52.840
My second one, see I'm going for the anime themed dog, so now I have a Shiba Inu named

06:52.840 --> 06:53.840
Menchi.

06:53.840 --> 07:00.360
He has in from XL Saga, who seems like a fairly well behaved doggy so far.

07:00.360 --> 07:06.240
As far as other games, they're ones I can't really talk about on air, so I'm gonna leave

07:06.240 --> 07:07.240
those alone.

07:07.240 --> 07:12.240
Oh yeah, and we are probably within the next couple weeks gonna be starting up on World

07:12.240 --> 07:13.240
of Warcraft.

07:13.240 --> 07:17.240
Oh boy, okay, well we need somebody from this show to be in there to give us updates, so...

07:17.240 --> 07:24.240
Yyyyep. I'm gonna play an undead rogue, or a priest.

07:24.240 --> 07:26.240
Undead priest, undead rogue.

07:26.240 --> 07:29.240
Or I'm gonna be playing a night elf hunter on another server.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.240
Haven't made a decision yet, huh? What are they doing?

07:31.240 --> 07:35.240
I hear that their expansion that they're doing for World of Warcraft, it's free.

07:35.240 --> 07:36.240
Oh, interesting.

07:36.240 --> 07:37.240
Downloadable.

07:37.240 --> 07:43.440
Because they figured that the users, they're giving them a little kickback because they've paid enough.

07:43.440 --> 07:44.440
Wow!

07:44.440 --> 07:45.440
Yeah!

07:45.440 --> 07:48.200
Square Enix needs to take a hint here.

07:48.200 --> 07:52.680
And also though, with your first month of World of Warcraft, you do pay nothing.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.560
Well yeah, a lot of MMOs do that though, one month at a time.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.840
Ragnarok doesn't, bastard.

07:57.840 --> 07:59.840
F-Ragnarok.

07:59.840 --> 08:04.720
So, they give you the first month free because, you know, it's like any other drug dealer, man.

08:04.720 --> 08:08.360
They give you that first hit for, you know, a discount price, then you gotta come back,

08:08.360 --> 08:11.060
then they know there's demand, then, you know, they got you.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.060
That's right.

08:12.060 --> 08:15.160
It's like, get your first dose of heroines free.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.160
Anyway.

08:16.160 --> 08:21.840
Now, Dark Sakura, since you weren't here last week, Loki and I gave our impressions on Nintendogs.

08:21.840 --> 08:25.360
Were you impressed with the Nintendogs compared to what you saw at E3, or?

08:25.360 --> 08:26.360
The boobies!

08:26.360 --> 08:27.360
The boobies!

08:27.360 --> 08:29.880
But besides the cuteness factor.

08:29.880 --> 08:31.880
My dog is retarded.

08:31.880 --> 08:39.020
I'm doesn't get it I gave him the lay down command sounds too much like sit

08:39.020 --> 08:43.840
down so we might tell him to sit down he lays down although I renamed the roll

08:43.840 --> 08:48.440
over to play dead so he sticks his legs in the year his little stub legs he is

08:48.440 --> 08:52.400
excellent when it comes to the frisbee though he makes me lots of money so

08:52.400 --> 08:59.880
would you recommend the game to somebody else yes why yes because the puppies the

08:59.880 --> 09:04.320
cuteness factor. You have to feed your puppies. You have to bathe your puppies and you have

09:04.320 --> 09:07.400
to pet your puppies and you have to take them for a walk and remember to clean up their

09:07.400 --> 09:15.120
crap. Is Nintendogs as annoying as a Tamagotchi? Tamagotchi was really stupid. I have a Digimon

09:15.120 --> 09:19.200
still. I have an old school Digimon. Why is Nintendogs not stupid? Because they don't

09:19.200 --> 09:24.880
look like little digital blips on the screen. Your puppy likes you too and he jumps and

09:24.880 --> 09:29.140
He plays Bone, he plays Fizbee, and he throws Fizbee like,

09:29.140 --> 09:31.140
BULLSHIT, YOU JUST THREW IT AWAY, WHY SHOULD I BE-

09:31.140 --> 09:32.140
OKAY HERE.

09:33.260 --> 09:34.760
So they got a lot of personality.

09:34.760 --> 09:35.640
He was a puppy.

09:35.640 --> 09:36.140
Alright.

09:37.140 --> 09:38.640
Loki, what have you been playing this week?

09:38.640 --> 09:42.940
I like throwing the Bark Ball at my Nintendog because it's afraid of it.

09:43.600 --> 09:45.360
It reminds me so much of my mom's dog,

09:45.360 --> 09:47.940
because my mom's chihuahua is afraid of everything, so.

09:47.940 --> 09:50.400
I hit my puppy in the head the first time with the Bark Ball.

09:51.700 --> 09:52.240
And I went,

09:52.240 --> 09:52.740
EH!

09:53.200 --> 09:53.700
Like that.

09:53.700 --> 09:54.700
What will be?

10:23.700 --> 10:27.060
I don't like it. So, you know, it's just

10:27.060 --> 10:30.740
really repetitive. It's just not my thing. So,

10:30.740 --> 10:33.980
the hell with that. We got the Namco Battle Collection.

10:33.980 --> 10:38.300
Classic games, if I'm really bored, maybe.

10:38.300 --> 10:42.820
But I'm not too big a fan of that. I did like, however, you did the PSP

10:42.820 --> 10:46.500
GameSend for me. Yeah, GameSharing. Okay, GameSharing.

10:46.500 --> 10:50.860
You did the GameSharing feature for me so I could play the little demos.

10:50.860 --> 10:54.380
I was a little disappointed that they were only first round demos, but there were a

10:54.380 --> 10:55.660
heck of a lot of demos on there.

10:55.660 --> 11:00.320
You know, Dig Dug, Rally X, now granted it's the same game from the eighties, but

11:00.320 --> 11:00.820
still

11:00.820 --> 11:04.580
to be able for you to send those to me for free was kinda neat.

11:04.580 --> 11:07.180
You know, there was a lot of games on there and they did also they have these

11:07.180 --> 11:09.340
arrangement games, four different arrangement games,

11:09.340 --> 11:13.260
which are kinda updated graphics, it's almost like the game is remade, which was

11:13.260 --> 11:14.500
really cool, those are really cool.

11:14.500 --> 11:18.860
And Rally X arrangement, that's the only place you can play Rally X Arrangement, that's one of my favorite

11:18.860 --> 11:19.740
arrangement games I ever did.

11:19.740 --> 11:24.640
Yeah, and I think that they're actually they have the rally X and they have new rally X which I think new rally X is

11:24.640 --> 11:26.640
The one that was on the Ridge Racer

11:26.640 --> 11:32.280
New rally X is a there's really no different rally X arrangements work. But yeah, okay. So anyways, it was really cool

11:32.280 --> 11:37.760
Um, and then I also I have depth jr. But I haven't gotten the plate yet looks cool

11:37.800 --> 11:41.340
Just you know, hopefully this time I can hear the sound unlike e3

11:42.640 --> 11:46.440
Then I have a lot of PlayStation 2 games. I'm playing I played this street racing game

11:46.440 --> 11:51.220
I don't remember was called now sucked, but it was for the Japanese system

11:51.680 --> 11:56.440
Then playing still more burnout 3 we've been actually doing to play rage mode now

11:56.440 --> 12:02.400
And that's a whole lot more fun. It was when you add another player and they crashed in their cargos flying over you

12:02.400 --> 12:04.400
Oh, that's really cool

12:04.520 --> 12:10.080
Played burnout legends the demo for that that game is so much better than burnout 3 and it's gonna fucking rock

12:10.080 --> 12:12.080
I'm buying it as soon as it comes out

12:12.080 --> 12:16.320
What's great about it is you can actually do the crash breaker where you make your car

12:16.320 --> 12:18.840
explode every time you crash.

12:18.840 --> 12:19.840
I love that.

12:19.840 --> 12:20.840
That's fucking awesome.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.120
And plus there's jumps and it's a lot faster so it's really cool.

12:24.120 --> 12:27.840
Then on top of that I played actually with my DS a little bit because I got some more

12:27.840 --> 12:28.840
games.

12:28.840 --> 12:29.840
I got pack and roll which was really interesting.

12:29.840 --> 12:31.520
I love pack and roll.

12:31.520 --> 12:35.760
It's just not really my thing but it's a lot better than pack picks that's for sure because

12:35.760 --> 12:36.760
that game kind of sucks.

12:36.760 --> 12:37.760
Pack picks was awesome.

12:37.760 --> 12:43.600
Anyways, so then I also played the DS version of Star Wars Episode III, and that was actually

12:43.600 --> 12:44.600
pretty cool.

12:44.600 --> 12:48.960
It looked like a really good Super Nintendo game, that's what it reminded me of.

12:48.960 --> 12:50.760
What's the DS feature in that game?

12:50.760 --> 12:56.240
Well, in some of the stuff it's just a status screen, in other ones it's just like you can

12:56.240 --> 12:59.920
use it for the flight sim parts and stuff like that.

12:59.920 --> 13:04.240
It's mainly they don't really use touch screen stuff that much, but it's just kind of...

13:04.240 --> 13:08.200
I've said this on a previous episode, you don't have to whore the touch thing in every

13:08.200 --> 13:09.200
game.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.100
The dual screen thing is fine, I mean, make use of that.

13:12.100 --> 13:15.960
Some other things I was going to mention though, at the conference thing, they were talking

13:15.960 --> 13:19.800
about the game coming out from Konami, Lost in Blue.

13:19.800 --> 13:22.760
They're doing a lot of things with the DS that fucking rock.

13:22.760 --> 13:25.760
For example, there's one part where you have to make fire.

13:25.760 --> 13:31.440
You take the stylus and you rub it between your hands like it's a stick, and you're rubbing

13:31.440 --> 13:33.320
sticks together to make fire.

13:33.320 --> 13:38.020
you're cooking fish and in order to cook the fish it's like on a barbecue so you can actually

13:38.020 --> 13:43.900
close the lid of the DS and the fish will cook faster and you can actually might overcook

13:43.900 --> 13:47.940
the fish if you do stuff like that but they're doing some really innovative stuff with that.

13:47.940 --> 13:49.340
Weird, that's wacky.

13:49.340 --> 13:55.380
But just it was really amazing and I have to say after seeing all the 360 footage, seeing

13:55.380 --> 14:00.620
Ghost Recon 3 Advanced Warfighter, Tom Clancy's new game, it fucking looks sexy.

14:00.620 --> 14:04.300
I don't even like first-person shooters, but oh my god does that look sexy.

14:04.300 --> 14:07.680
What was that insider info you were telling me about 360 before the show?

14:07.680 --> 14:13.980
Oh, 360, a few things. Um, they're only shipping 700,000 to 1 million units

14:13.980 --> 14:18.440
at launch. Um, so, you know, that's why you... You heard it here first.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.880
You heard it here first. Yeah, I mean, that's not really known. Um,

14:21.880 --> 14:26.160
and for backwards compatibility, you have to have the hard drive.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.500
No hard drive, no playing the old games.

14:29.500 --> 14:32.580
interest I did not I've not read that anywhere

14:32.580 --> 14:37.140
and interesting got some information out there but I'm also going to support a

14:37.140 --> 14:38.460
few games at launch

14:38.460 --> 14:41.780
and they're gonna be adding more every two weeks why do you have to have the

14:41.780 --> 14:43.340
hard drive for backwards compatibility

14:43.340 --> 14:46.940
I don't know because because the emulators gonna be on the drive right

14:46.940 --> 14:49.260
is that what is something like that Mel thinks he knows what's going on

14:49.260 --> 14:52.180
essentially the way they have to you have reverse it you know engineer you

14:52.180 --> 14:52.460
know

14:52.460 --> 14:56.000
play backwards compatibility is they have to have software for it and their thing is they

14:56.000 --> 14:56.420
haven't

14:56.420 --> 14:59.780
officially finished it out yet so thing is you're gonna have to have the hard drive

14:59.780 --> 15:01.700
available so when it's ready then you know

15:01.700 --> 15:05.180
you can download it or whatever I'm not sure how it works but

15:05.180 --> 15:08.480
interesting yeah because it's not basically the backwards thing hasn't

15:08.480 --> 15:09.260
been finished yet

15:09.260 --> 15:12.940
if you think about the Xbox Live Silver that they're talking about

15:12.940 --> 15:16.380
you know you're like oh I can play some online games nope think again you gotta buy the

15:16.380 --> 15:16.780
Xbox Live

15:16.780 --> 15:19.700
I'm gonna get to a story about that in a little bit. Anyways okay so we got that okay

15:19.700 --> 15:23.580
there's another thing that they're adding with Xbox Live that's really cool spectator mode

15:23.580 --> 15:26.860
so for example they're doing the Madden challenge with the new next-gen

15:26.860 --> 15:30.380
Madden game you can go in watch the game

15:30.380 --> 15:34.500
watch him as a spectator watch people play you know racing games everything so

15:34.500 --> 15:36.700
that's a new thing that they have spectator mode on that

15:36.700 --> 15:39.740
and the webcam sounds good

15:39.740 --> 15:44.260
as far as my gaming week I haven't played a whole lot of new games I did go

15:44.260 --> 15:47.020
out and do some impulse buys the other day I was at Fry's which is like this

15:47.020 --> 15:48.980
huge electronics store here that sells a lot of games

15:48.980 --> 15:52.060
and they have a lot of cheap games so I was looking through their twenty dollar games

15:52.060 --> 15:55.940
I picked up on Namco 50th Anniversary Collection because it was only $15

15:55.940 --> 16:00.260
and the Namco 50th Anniversary Collection has like 14 old Namco games in it

16:00.260 --> 16:01.380
Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man

16:01.380 --> 16:04.140
and this is the one where I was talking about a few weeks on the show has

16:04.140 --> 16:05.460
licensed music in it

16:05.460 --> 16:08.700
like it has Dexys Midnight Runners, come on Eileen, it has

16:08.700 --> 16:13.660
She Drives Me Crazy, like all those songs. Okay, Namco 50th Anniversary Collection

16:13.660 --> 16:17.780
sucks. I do not recommend this game. I'm sorry to say

16:17.780 --> 16:21.020
I love Namco. This collection sucks

16:21.020 --> 16:25.220
balls and the reason why they've done this before

16:25.220 --> 16:28.420
many times on PlayStation 1 and

16:28.420 --> 16:32.620
next-gen, er, well I shouldn't say next-gen, but you know, current gen I guess would be

16:32.620 --> 16:33.180
a way to say it.

16:33.180 --> 16:37.220
Current gen since they've already done this. Granted there's a couple a new games

16:37.220 --> 16:38.980
here like what the King

16:38.980 --> 16:42.500
well there's one on the PSP I think the uh...King of the Balloon or something?

16:42.500 --> 16:45.540
King of the Balloon which blows anyway and there's one on the

16:45.540 --> 16:49.060
the 50th anniversary collection like King and Dry, I don't even know what it's called

16:49.060 --> 16:49.900
it's it's that

16:49.900 --> 16:51.580
Unimpressive to me

16:51.580 --> 16:57.160
Here's what ticked me off about it the music this music thing that they had been hyping up on the news sites

16:57.920 --> 17:02.040
Granted I will give Namco credit because they didn't advertise this on the box that had 80 music

17:02.040 --> 17:08.020
But you don't have it during the actual game. The only time you hear this is in the menu

17:08.140 --> 17:10.620
That's it. So when you go into the actual game

17:11.380 --> 17:12.880
There's no music nothing

17:12.880 --> 17:19.120
Yeah, it actually did the same thing for the Activision collection because you know, there was cool ladies music in the like menu screens

17:19.120 --> 17:21.900
But when you play it still blip it's boring to me

17:21.900 --> 17:27.080
And they there wasn't really the array the arranged games were not nowhere to be seen

17:27.540 --> 17:34.000
There were a couple unlocks. I just think there's so much more that could have been done with this Midway collections great stuff

17:34.000 --> 17:37.020
Oh online ranking boards Xbox Live aware

17:38.580 --> 17:41.020
Why didn't Namco implement a scoreboard?

17:41.020 --> 17:45.080
Why didn't they they've got a great interface for the way the games are set up wouldn't

17:45.080 --> 17:48.200
downloadable content be awesome for a retro collection like this?

17:48.200 --> 17:52.440
Maybe if you were too busy being bought by Bondi. I guess, I don't know, but I

17:52.440 --> 17:58.240
honestly, if you do not own any of these previous Namco collections, I suppose

17:58.240 --> 18:01.500
this is a place to start because these are some important games

18:01.500 --> 18:04.520
that are good and you should have in your collection, but honestly

18:04.520 --> 18:07.880
I don't recommend this game. Even if you're a fan of classic gaming, get the other

18:07.880 --> 18:09.160
Namco collections, they're better.

18:09.160 --> 18:12.400
Or if you have a PSP, buy the Namco Battle Collection. Absolutely.

18:12.400 --> 18:18.360
Now the Namco battle collection is cool. It's it's it's got the arranged versions in it. It's got the game beaming multiplayer

18:18.360 --> 18:21.840
I think it works better on a handheld than it does on the console

18:21.840 --> 18:26.240
If you are interested in this go get the PSP version do not buy the X thing, too

18:26.240 --> 18:33.300
Is if the monitors were vertical or whatever you can adjust the orientation so that the monitors are taller and stuff. That's on there

18:33.300 --> 18:40.100
Um, it's just really awesome. Cool. I did actually play other Konami games this weekend. What's up? Well, Dan and I went to the casino

18:42.180 --> 18:45.900
Okay, it's a lot of machines hey he lost a dollar and I made 12

18:46.900 --> 18:52.020
What else did I play? I bought dot hack part 1 because all of a sudden I'm like I want to get even though there's four

18:52.020 --> 18:52.540
Parts. I'm like

18:52.540 --> 18:55.900
I want to get into the dot hack games again because I played them a little bit and they're faux

18:56.100 --> 19:02.460
MMOs where the the plot is that it's an MMO RPG, but it's not really an MMO RPG. You should watch the anime

19:02.460 --> 19:07.020
I came free with an anime disc so I'm gonna watch it even though I'm not usually like really into anime

19:07.020 --> 19:08.900
I'm gonna watch it. It's cool

19:08.900 --> 19:11.060
By the way, if you want I do have the whole

19:11.780 --> 19:17.620
First dot hack series. Well, maybe maybe if I get into it hands up. Hey, it's kind of an older game

19:17.620 --> 19:23.620
But like I said, I was budget shopping this week because kids at orange launch radio. They're not giving us free games. Yeah

19:24.620 --> 19:30.440
What what there's a certain game that you forgot to talk about. Hello. Hello kitty. Yeah

19:30.440 --> 19:35.080
Yeah. Why did you play it? Because my friend has my GameCube, so I haven't been able to

19:35.080 --> 19:37.960
get it back yet. Well, it's a good thing I didn't bring over another GameCube game for

19:37.960 --> 19:44.520
you. Oh, damn you all! What'd you get me? What'd you get me? Killer7. Cool! Okay. My

19:44.520 --> 19:49.400
GameCube is accessible. I will beat up my friend and get my GameCube out. And I have

19:49.400 --> 19:54.360
a 50-inch widescreen TV. Do you happen to have a GunCon2? I have a 30-inch. I do indeed

19:54.360 --> 19:59.720
have GunCon. I have two GunCon2s. I have a GunCon. Well, GunCon for the Playstation 2?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.720
No, I have two of those.

20:01.720 --> 20:03.720
Because I have the Dino one.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.720
The Dino Crisis one.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.720
Bring me more free games. I'm sick of questions.

20:07.720 --> 20:09.720
Game companies that are listening to us.

20:09.720 --> 20:11.720
I have Neg Cons and Jog Cons.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.720
We have lots of listeners. Send me free games.

20:13.720 --> 20:15.720
I'm glad you mentioned that.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.720
We do have game companies that will be listening to us.

20:17.720 --> 20:19.720
Thanks to me.

20:19.720 --> 20:21.720
Because I have done a lot of press kits.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.720
Hi game companies!

20:23.720 --> 20:25.720
Apparently EA does listen to

20:25.720 --> 20:27.720
There's one guy at EA

20:27.720 --> 20:32.360
that unlistens to gaming podcasts, not us, which made me sad, but, but, was it because

20:32.360 --> 20:36.320
we kind of talk shit about Madden? No, we don't talk shit about Madden, I just don't

20:36.320 --> 20:42.360
like Madden. I like Burnout, I talk much about Burnout, okay? I seem to remember reviewing

20:42.360 --> 20:46.040
Battlefield 2 and my review was something along the lines of, what's the big idea? Battlefield

20:46.040 --> 20:50.160
2 is friggin' sexy, let me tell you. It's a sexy looking game, man. No, no, no, it's

20:50.160 --> 20:55.000
friggin' sexy. Okay, and I can tell you why it's sexy. They have this whole point of thing,

20:55.000 --> 20:59.160
you you're attacking people whatever and you can switch point of views like that

20:59.160 --> 21:02.120
and what's great about it though is like you'll be okay you're

21:02.120 --> 21:04.360
say you're in a tank whatever and there's people coming across this

21:04.360 --> 21:08.520
bridge you're attacking them oh now you don't have a really clear eye

21:08.520 --> 21:11.720
so you really quickly zoom into someone else's point of view

21:11.720 --> 21:15.800
and stuff like that it's for me it was what's the big big deal but but granted

21:15.800 --> 21:19.480
i'm not a fan of this type of game i knew before i picked it up i wouldn't

21:19.480 --> 21:22.120
probably would enjoy it i'm a single player multiplayer game that's what i

21:22.120 --> 21:27.520
I mean, well, you know if you're into that kind of game, you'll probably really like it. I just not my type of game Mel

21:27.520 --> 21:29.520
What's one game you've been playing this week? Mr. Mel B

21:31.240 --> 21:36.120
Played a lot of quack shot on Genesis actually what made you decide to go to Genesis?

21:36.120 --> 21:39.940
Oh, well, it actually was the classic gaming expo about two weeks ago

21:39.940 --> 21:47.320
and so I checked it out and you're always going into retro stuff and just because my girlfriend had just pulled out her

21:47.320 --> 21:52.800
her CDX actually because she was into Sega CD at the time when we were just trying to

21:52.800 --> 21:56.340
basically get all our old gaming systems up on the TV going.

21:56.340 --> 22:00.740
So we started going around buying stuff and the reason why, I mean I really loved Genesis

22:00.740 --> 22:04.380
games back in the day, I thought it was one of the best systems out there.

22:04.380 --> 22:09.300
And yeah, a lot of the Disney games that came out for Genesis Quackshot, Fantasia, Castle

22:09.300 --> 22:13.280
of Illusions with Mickey Mouse, it was just some of the most fun side scrolling action

22:13.280 --> 22:18.240
games I'd you know played at the time my 16-bit was a huge deal back then you

22:18.240 --> 22:22.080
know oh yeah I remember did you see the guys um the guy that was making the

22:22.080 --> 22:25.360
portable systems the custom portable systems at a classic game actually

22:25.360 --> 22:30.400
yes be there yes I did see he's doing a Dreamcast portable systems now oh very

22:30.400 --> 22:35.840
cool very cool all right anything else um see besides that I was playing a lot

22:35.840 --> 22:42.240
of like old EA Sports like called Lakers versus Celtics Madden 93 back then but

22:42.240 --> 22:47.160
As far as like current, well, more current games, actually was like for two days straight

22:47.160 --> 22:52.960
I was just absolutely hooked on Bust A Move 2, Tengoku Mix, Japanese Playstation.

22:52.960 --> 22:57.280
Main reason was because I picked it up for only $10 at the, uh, or as if you go on Ebay

22:57.280 --> 23:00.360
or something like that you're paying at least $30 or $40 for that bad boy.

23:00.360 --> 23:04.200
You want to see DER's granddaddy go pick up a copy of Bust A Move.

23:04.200 --> 23:08.760
Actually that was, well the original Bust A Move was the reason why I got a modded Playstation

23:08.760 --> 23:10.280
in the first place.

23:10.280 --> 23:13.960
I was playing Bust A Move 2 before I was playing, well it was Bust A Groove here in the US,

23:13.960 --> 23:17.320
so I was playing Bust A Groove before I was playing DDR, so.

23:17.320 --> 23:21.000
Yeah, that was just a precursor to everything, and I mean after playing that it made me realize

23:21.000 --> 23:28.520
how horrible Dance Summit 2001 was. I mean, that was just a huge step back for Enix at the time,

23:28.520 --> 23:32.520
goodness, because it was like, I don't know why they ruined a franchise like that, because the

23:32.520 --> 23:37.480
first two, um, parts, you know, first two, uh, games were awesome. You had personalities,

23:37.480 --> 23:42.880
He had characters people got attached to the music was you know great the first one had like great novelty type songs

23:42.880 --> 23:47.360
You know that would fit a video game, but the second one they did some really great production. They had guys from like

23:47.920 --> 23:53.600
The front X yeah a vex earth wind and fire like Maurice white he did like hero couldn't steam

23:53.600 --> 23:57.200
So I was like, you know, this was like something you could actually legitimately here

23:57.200 --> 24:02.380
you know as mainstream pop radio and then just the third one totally took a step backwards and just

24:02.920 --> 24:05.200
Everything you knew about the game and loved about the game was gone

24:05.200 --> 24:16.200
You know, I think, I think Square and, uh, Enix, um, now that they've merged, they should do, um, they should do, like, a, a Final Fantasy dancing game with a bus. No, I'm kidding. It's gonna be horrible.

24:16.200 --> 24:18.200
Hey, I actually liked Dance Summit.

24:18.200 --> 24:19.200
Really?

24:19.200 --> 24:28.200
Honestly enough. But, you know, I was, Marius White also did anime stuff, too. He did the Gatchaman anime, so I was like, the second one's my favorite of the bunch.

24:28.200 --> 24:32.600
But I did really like the third one. It had a very innovative idea and a special controller.

24:32.600 --> 24:35.640
It made me think of the old ColecoVision

24:35.640 --> 24:38.840
joystick one with the little four buttons on it.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.520
Alright, we're going to get into some gaming news tonight, but before we get into the gaming news,

24:42.520 --> 24:46.640
we're actually going to go ahead, and because DarkSakura, we don't know if she can stay for the whole show tonight,

24:46.640 --> 24:48.960
we want to make sure she can bring her segment to you guys.

24:48.960 --> 24:53.120
And of course, it's the one and only DarkSakura's advice column, because boys and girls,

24:53.120 --> 24:59.120
If we stayed at home and played video games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and get married.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.120
Right, DarkSakura?

25:00.120 --> 25:01.120
I guess.

25:01.120 --> 25:06.120
Alright, so DarkSakura, here's your advice column. What are you going to tell the kids about tonight?

25:06.120 --> 25:11.120
If you're on your honeymoon, don't go do your podcast, because you never know when you're going to leave.

25:11.120 --> 25:16.120
No, um, today's bit of advice is how to survive in a plummeting elevator.

25:16.120 --> 25:19.120
Elevators have numerous safety features.

25:19.120 --> 25:23.520
There have been very few recorded incidents involving death from plummeting elevators.

25:23.520 --> 25:28.560
In general, it is highly unlikely for a cable, also called traction elevator, to fall all

25:28.560 --> 25:30.720
the way to the bottom of the shaft.

25:30.720 --> 25:37.720
Moreover, the compressed air column in the elevator hoistway and the car buffers at the

25:37.720 --> 25:42.520
bottom of the hoistway may keep the forces of the impact survivable.

25:42.520 --> 25:45.920
Number one, flatten your body against the car floor.

25:45.920 --> 25:49.320
They should distribute the force of impact rather than concentrate it on one area of

25:49.320 --> 25:50.320
your body.

25:50.320 --> 25:51.320
Standing may be difficult anyway.

25:51.320 --> 25:53.140
I would have never thought of that.

25:53.140 --> 25:58.040
Number two, cover your face and head to prevent them from sealing parts that may break loose.

25:58.040 --> 25:59.560
But my final piece of advice.

25:59.560 --> 26:00.560
Take the stairs fatass.

26:00.560 --> 26:03.360
Take the fucking stairs.

26:03.360 --> 26:08.040
And on that note, I will go ahead and give my final word of the show.

26:08.040 --> 26:09.040
Yes honey.

26:09.040 --> 26:12.720
Which is reject false icons and don't chug Guinness.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
Alright.

26:13.720 --> 26:14.720
Goodnight everyone.

26:14.720 --> 26:19.500
DarkSaga for being here and have a good one and congratulations once again on getting

26:19.500 --> 26:20.500
hitched.

26:20.500 --> 26:25.360
Let's get into some gaming news tonight.

26:25.360 --> 26:31.720
Started off with the Xbox 360, Xbox Live 2.0, the details are out and yes if you have a

26:31.720 --> 26:38.000
silver subscription to Xbox Live you will be able to download game trailers, demos of

26:38.000 --> 26:43.840
upcoming games, episode style content and you can create a profile, leave voice messages

26:43.840 --> 26:49.720
for other live Xbox gamers the one thing you won't be able to do however is play

26:49.720 --> 26:54.200
games head-to-head sorry you will have to have a gold membership in order to do

26:54.200 --> 27:00.440
that gold membership $7.99 a month for a one month subscription card but they do

27:00.440 --> 27:07.360
have other ideas as well $19.99 for a three month option and let's see I

27:07.360 --> 27:13.080
believe it's $49.99 for a 12 month subscription card you want the kit that

27:13.080 --> 27:18.320
comes with a headset and all that stuff it's approximately $20 more depending on

27:18.320 --> 27:22.720
what you get they're saying that there's a headset pack it's a three-month set

27:22.720 --> 27:31.640
$10 rebate card on the game and joust from Xbox Live Arcade $39.99 so so most

27:31.640 --> 27:32.640
Joust!

27:32.640 --> 27:33.640
Woohoo!

27:33.640 --> 27:34.640
Joust!

27:34.640 --> 27:37.640
Joust was a rad game!

27:37.640 --> 27:38.640
Yeah!

27:38.640 --> 27:39.640
Like in the 80s.

27:39.640 --> 27:40.640
Seriously.

27:40.640 --> 27:45.840
You know, you run around with lances and you steal people's egos, you know?

27:45.840 --> 27:46.840
Lego my ego.

27:46.840 --> 27:47.840
That was joust.

27:47.840 --> 27:48.840
Oh god.

27:48.840 --> 27:52.480
So, those of you guys that were hoping that the silver subscription would allow you to

27:52.480 --> 27:53.480
play some games...

27:53.480 --> 27:54.480
Sorry.

27:54.480 --> 27:55.480
Exactly.

27:55.480 --> 27:56.480
Exactly.

27:56.480 --> 28:02.720
The whole core system is a joke anyways, I mean, it's like, yeah, here's this Xbox, it

28:02.720 --> 28:06.840
looks pretty but you can't do anything with it until you buy the rest.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.040
If you're listening to this show, you're a hardcore enough gamer where if you're going

28:10.040 --> 28:15.400
to be buying a 360, you really need to consider the higher end, and I'm not saying that as

28:15.400 --> 28:21.120
somebody who works for Microsoft, because I don't, but just do the math.

28:21.120 --> 28:25.240
If you think that later on you might be interested in any of this stuff, such as the hard drive,

28:25.240 --> 28:29.440
You're gonna end up paying more in the long run if you buy just the core system and then

28:29.440 --> 28:30.440
all this stuff separately.

28:30.440 --> 28:32.040
Hey, so you really need to think about this.

28:32.040 --> 28:38.160
Hey folks, listen, um, the hard drive, just the laptop drive anyways, think about it folks,

28:38.160 --> 28:43.780
buy the hard drive, upgrade it for free, or get the converter, you know I'm gonna be hooking

28:43.780 --> 28:46.480
up like some 300 gig hard drive to that thing.

28:46.480 --> 28:51.080
You know that's gonna happen, it's a matter of time.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.360
Moving on in the news tonight, Dance Dance Revolution, a game that's near and dear to

28:54.360 --> 28:57.960
our hearts because it's the whole reason we do Orange Launch Radio in one way or

28:57.960 --> 29:04.080
another you could say. Won the Video Music Award for Best Video Game

29:04.080 --> 29:08.880
Soundtrack. Pretty cool there and of course Dance Dance Revolution Extreme

29:08.880 --> 29:13.560
has stuff by like Duran Duran, Pet Shop Boys, a couple of covers in there, BT as

29:13.560 --> 29:20.960
well. The only thing they didn't actually show it as part of the show. And Dance

29:20.960 --> 29:28.960
Dance Dance Revolution was there to comment, and their comment was, SUCK IT, HALO 2!

29:28.960 --> 29:36.680
Wow, Blizzard won a pretty important hacking lawsuit this week.

29:36.680 --> 29:39.600
I think this is kind of interesting, there was an appeals court, the 8th Circuit Court

29:39.600 --> 29:45.480
of Appeals in St. Louis, and they ruled this week that federal law, specifically the DMCA,

29:45.480 --> 29:50.920
or the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, disallows players from altering Blizzard games to link

29:50.920 --> 29:55.540
with servers other than the company's official Battle.net site.

29:55.540 --> 30:00.920
So there were defendants in this case, Ross Combs, Rob Critterden, they reverse engineered

30:00.920 --> 30:07.560
Blizzard's protocol using some tools such as TCP Dump, and they had this project going

30:07.560 --> 30:12.940
on, the Bnet-D, that would allow your Blizzard games to connect with unofficial servers.

30:12.940 --> 30:16.480
And of course you get faster response times, all sorts of things that come along with using

30:16.480 --> 30:22.020
on official servers, however Blizzard layeth the smack down for them reverse engineering

30:22.020 --> 30:24.560
the program, so to speak.

30:24.560 --> 30:28.020
What I find is interesting is I know a lot of people that have sort of done something

30:28.020 --> 30:36.020
similar with Xbox Live, now I'm not too familiar on the exacts of how they hack, so it's probably

30:36.020 --> 30:41.580
a different process, but I think it's interesting that this kind of sets a precedent in a way.

30:41.580 --> 30:46.000
Well this is just, this is dumb. I think this is about like Starcraft if I remember correctly

30:46.000 --> 30:51.320
and it was just servers that they're playing on. I mean, it's not like that you actually

30:51.320 --> 30:56.480
have to pay for it, it's free, their servers, to place over, you know, the internet with

30:56.480 --> 30:58.260
Starcraft but, um.

30:58.260 --> 31:00.400
Maybe they're doing this for people to get banned, I don't know.

31:00.400 --> 31:04.160
I don't know, they like banning people, they're just, what can I say.

31:04.160 --> 31:07.720
Alright, let's get to another story. This one about Nintendogs, of course a game we

31:07.720 --> 31:09.860
we have not shut up about for the past few weeks,

31:09.860 --> 31:12.380
but this definitely is worth noting.

31:12.380 --> 31:15.340
Quarter of a million units sold already.

31:15.340 --> 31:17.140
In the first week, in the first week,

31:17.140 --> 31:20.860
that's about 15% of the amount of people that own a DS,

31:20.860 --> 31:23.980
which for a game in the first week of release

31:23.980 --> 31:25.860
is pretty damn good.

31:25.860 --> 31:27.900
A game that came out the same day,

31:27.900 --> 31:31.300
Advance Wars Dual Strike, also selling pretty well.

31:31.300 --> 31:33.300
So don't assume that Nintendogs

31:33.300 --> 31:35.560
is the only must-own DS game right now.

31:35.560 --> 31:37.260
Advance Wars, doing pretty well.

31:37.260 --> 31:38.700
I haven't had a chance to check out that game myself,

31:38.700 --> 31:40.840
but I've heard good things about it, so.

31:40.840 --> 31:42.900
Got Battalion Wars coming out soon, too.

31:42.900 --> 31:44.900
That's Advanced Wars for the GameCube.

31:46.180 --> 31:48.420
We were talking about PSP Game Sharing a little bit

31:48.420 --> 31:49.820
earlier in the show when I was talking about

31:49.820 --> 31:53.140
that we were doing the Namco Battle Museum.

31:53.140 --> 31:54.960
Tokyo Game Show is gonna be doing something

31:54.960 --> 31:56.840
with the PSP Game Sharing.

31:56.840 --> 31:59.420
If you're lucky enough to be going to the Tokyo Game Show

31:59.420 --> 32:02.060
this year, which of course, in Tokyo,

32:02.060 --> 32:05.880
they will be doing a PlayStation spot.

32:05.880 --> 32:08.020
It's like a booth where the PSP owners

32:08.020 --> 32:10.300
will be able to download demos of upcoming games

32:10.300 --> 32:11.140
from the spot.

32:12.060 --> 32:13.440
Where have I heard this before?

32:13.440 --> 32:17.220
Oh yes, Nintendo's DS download booth at E3.

32:17.220 --> 32:18.180
And how'd that work?

32:18.180 --> 32:19.820
Oh yeah, that's right, not very well.

32:19.820 --> 32:21.480
It was okay, you just had to hammer in

32:21.480 --> 32:22.900
to get what you wanted.

32:22.900 --> 32:24.640
You could get what you wanted eventually,

32:24.640 --> 32:26.100
but it was a little tricky.

32:26.100 --> 32:28.340
But very interesting, Sony's doing a very similar thing

32:28.340 --> 32:30.940
at Tokyo Game Show, if you're lucky enough to be going.

32:30.940 --> 32:34.100
You'll be able to check out Metal Gear Acid 2,

32:34.100 --> 32:39.440
Rengoku 2, Rockman Rockman, which of course is Mega Man's name overseas,

32:39.440 --> 32:43.280
Baito Hell 2000, and Portable Resort.

32:43.280 --> 32:48.160
I haven't heard of those last two, but. Portable Resort's Namco, and it's weird.

32:48.160 --> 32:53.600
Rengoku 2, I'm surprised they're even making a sequel to that.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.400
The first one kinda sucked. Well, check it out. It's gonna be downloadable.

32:57.400 --> 33:01.400
And then Rockman Legends. It's pretty cool, actually.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.520
I played a little bit of it.

33:03.520 --> 33:04.520
Yeah, how was that?

33:04.520 --> 33:07.840
It's just a direct port of the Playstation game, that's all it is.

33:07.840 --> 33:10.500
It's just a direct port, looks cool.

33:10.500 --> 33:14.360
I'm excited about it, I wish they'd released more sequels, but you know.

33:14.360 --> 33:16.920
Loki, you got a couple of hack and crack stories for us tonight?

33:16.920 --> 33:19.480
Yes, yes I do.

33:19.480 --> 33:27.200
The first on the list is the We Are Back group, you know, the ones behind several of the launchers

33:27.200 --> 33:31.120
and the whole exploit, you know, to actually play homebrew stuff.

33:31.120 --> 33:35.860
They've released a program to actually fake update your system.

33:35.860 --> 33:42.560
So in other words, for example, on my system, which was a 1.5, because I have 2, but I upgraded

33:42.560 --> 33:44.740
mine to a fake 1.5.2.

33:44.740 --> 33:48.380
Which will allow me to play Namco Museum Collection which wants to upgrade your system if you

33:48.380 --> 33:49.380
don't.

33:49.380 --> 33:51.400
And it won't play unless you upgrade your system.

33:51.400 --> 33:54.180
But because it tricks it, now you can play it.

33:54.180 --> 33:59.900
And you can do this through just version 1 all the way to 2.

33:59.900 --> 34:05.460
And what's also interesting is actually they're working on it right now because they want

34:05.460 --> 34:06.700
to be perfect on it.

34:06.700 --> 34:12.480
They have a way to revert those systems that actually are 152 and 151 to revert them back

34:12.480 --> 34:13.480
to 15.

34:13.480 --> 34:14.660
So they'll play homebrew stuff.

34:14.660 --> 34:20.060
So if you haven't upgraded yours to 2.0 yet and you're not 1.5.

34:20.060 --> 34:23.740
Why don't they just work on getting the homebrew stuff to work with 2.0 because I kind of want

34:23.740 --> 34:31.440
They have 2.0, they changed all their encryption the way they do it, so it's a little tougher,

34:31.440 --> 34:36.080
but pretty soon it's not going to matter.

34:36.080 --> 34:39.880
They can revert those 1.5.2.1's back to 1.5.

34:39.880 --> 34:42.520
Next step, 2.0's to 1.5.

34:42.520 --> 34:46.320
It's a matter of time, so I don't know, we'll see.

34:46.320 --> 34:48.120
But that's what they've got going on right now.

34:48.120 --> 34:53.520
Other than that, just the same homebrew stuff, made a minesweeper game, it's kind of cool

34:53.520 --> 34:57.280
But um yeah, it's pretty much all that's going on. All right. Uh

34:58.320 --> 35:01.600
Let's get to some housekeeping stuff. Let's start it off with a mailbag. Shall we?

35:02.880 --> 35:06.520
Of course if you want to send us an email you can always drop us a line. It's to go

35:07.560 --> 35:13.500
TOGO at orange lounge radio.com to send us an email. We got just two emails this week

35:13.500 --> 35:16.580
I don't want to spend a whole lot of time on emails tonight because we spent enough time

35:17.000 --> 35:21.980
Talking about stuff, but we did get a couple good emails and we want to read this certainly

35:21.980 --> 35:27.160
This one is a difference of opinion type issue. This one comes to us from Ed M

35:27.960 --> 35:33.800
Sent us this email here says I really enjoy the shows and congrats on the pod show awards

35:34.880 --> 35:39.560
Actually, I don't think did we win something pod show? I don't think that was a podcast

35:39.560 --> 35:43.480
Yeah, the podcast award if if we did win something pod show that's news to me. Hey, cool

35:43.480 --> 35:48.460
No, I think pod show is Adam Curry's side. I I get lost in all that podcasting

35:48.460 --> 35:50.700
So, you know, I'm just I'm just here to talk about games

35:50.700 --> 35:54.640
games. We win a couple awards while we're at it, cool. But no, that's alright. We know

35:54.640 --> 35:58.880
it gets confusing. Here's the real part of the letter we want to read. You guys really

35:58.880 --> 36:02.760
need to lay off parents and how they raise their children. I am a parent with two adolescent

36:02.760 --> 36:07.600
boys who is also a gamer and have been since I was in junior high. You guys on the other

36:07.600 --> 36:11.720
hand are not parents and really have no clue about it. Yet you profess to have it all worked

36:11.720 --> 36:16.160
out. Allow me to be the first to tell you that you forget about it everything you think

36:16.160 --> 36:23.960
will change. Even if I have read and signed your proposed disclaimer, it still would not

36:23.960 --> 36:27.840
have protected my children from the Easter egg in San Andreas had I purchased that for

36:27.840 --> 36:32.160
my sons. In your infinite wisdom you have not addressed how to protect the consumers

36:32.160 --> 36:37.200
from the game developers that you continue to defend that lie their asses off. Rockstar

36:37.200 --> 36:41.600
lied about the hows and whys of that particular programming gem. The game developers have

36:41.600 --> 36:45.380
every right to put into their games whatever they want but if I ask I also

36:45.380 --> 36:49.700
have the right to be told the truth they share in the responsibility let me

36:49.700 --> 36:53.620
finish this mail then we'll respond here games reviews news and like is your

36:53.620 --> 36:57.900
shtick trying to explain to people how to be parents is not stick to what you

36:57.900 --> 37:02.700
know and leave parenting to the parents in the audience burn no actually um Dark

37:02.700 --> 37:06.020
Sakura wrote him back and you know they have they have a nice conversation going

37:06.020 --> 37:08.460
on but we do want to address his email the rest of us want to respond to that

37:08.460 --> 37:14.940
Let me start so he does say that Rockstar lied about the hows and why of

37:14.940 --> 37:18.140
the particular programming gem of course the hot coffee mod going back a couple

37:18.140 --> 37:23.100
months ago to that news there. I do think that there was and I said this a couple

37:23.100 --> 37:27.860
months ago in this the story first came out I do think when Rockstar put this

37:27.860 --> 37:33.380
game out they never intended that mod to be seen I do think they put it in the

37:33.380 --> 37:38.420
game on purpose but somewhere in the testing process they intended to take it

37:38.420 --> 37:44.500
out. As I've mentioned on a previous show, I think a pointer, of course if you design

37:44.500 --> 37:48.380
a game you have a flow chart, right? Basically a ginormous flow chart that works your way

37:48.380 --> 37:54.020
through the game. Whatever led from point, you know, the game to the hot coffee part,

37:54.020 --> 37:59.660
that pointer was taken out. So in Rockstar's eyes, there was no possible way, there was

37:59.660 --> 38:04.600
no up, up, down, down, left, right code that was going to let you access that. It was out

38:04.600 --> 38:10.840
of the game. A very similar parallel would be Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, no there's

38:10.840 --> 38:15.700
no Hot Coffee mod in Dance Dance Revolution Extreme, but there is a song, Memories is

38:15.700 --> 38:21.640
the song, Konami took this song out of the game at the last minute. Why? I don't know.

38:21.640 --> 38:26.360
But instead of taking the game, the song out, all the data's on the disc, but some hackers

38:26.360 --> 38:31.760
found out that if you turn a certain hexadecimal point on, or whatever, hack your card data,

38:31.760 --> 38:36.000
can access the song it's like you're putting the pointer back in on the flow

38:36.000 --> 38:39.200
chart that's what happened with Grand Theft Auto San Andreas I'm almost

38:39.200 --> 38:42.520
positive this is what happened is that that pointer that was intended to get

38:42.520 --> 38:47.120
taken out got put back in and of course with a huge company like Rockstar you

38:47.120 --> 38:49.800
probably have the programmers that knew that was in there but they had thought

38:49.800 --> 38:55.000
they had taken it out and didn't realize that some kid was going to figure out

38:55.000 --> 38:59.880
how to put it back in so whose fault is this in this case I don't know but

38:59.880 --> 39:01.880
But here's what I do know.

39:01.880 --> 39:04.320
Programmers will be taking the extra effort from now on

39:04.320 --> 39:06.120
instead of simply taking a pointer out.

39:06.120 --> 39:08.000
They're gonna go back and recompile all the data

39:08.000 --> 39:10.680
and these games will be pushed back a couple of months

39:10.680 --> 39:12.840
while they rebuild the code from the ground up

39:12.840 --> 39:15.160
to ensure that this crap is no longer in the games

39:15.160 --> 39:16.560
when it's not intended to be.

39:16.560 --> 39:19.720
Because Grand Theft Auto San Andreas has set the bar

39:19.720 --> 39:23.720
at that now, that you can no longer leave this stuff

39:23.720 --> 39:25.800
that you do not want accessed on the disc

39:25.800 --> 39:28.360
because people will find it and they will play it.

39:28.360 --> 39:30.200
and as you can see what happened here.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.860
Now, in regards to the portion of the email

39:32.860 --> 39:35.840
that talks about the person being a parent with kids

39:35.840 --> 39:39.940
and also being a gamer, I'm gonna guess if you're a gamer,

39:39.940 --> 39:43.640
you know what is and isn't appropriate for your kids.

39:43.640 --> 39:47.100
So when we go off on parents or what have you,

39:47.100 --> 39:51.160
please don't assume you, sir, are a part of these people.

39:51.160 --> 39:54.080
Unfortunately, there are many, many out there

39:54.080 --> 39:55.800
educated parents, and you're right,

39:55.800 --> 39:58.840
I may not be a parent myself, but I see it.

39:58.840 --> 40:01.880
I see these parents that are going into the stores

40:01.880 --> 40:04.460
and they're letting their kids boss them around

40:04.460 --> 40:06.760
and the kids are the ones picking up the game

40:06.760 --> 40:09.240
and they don't seem to be,

40:09.240 --> 40:11.820
the people, the parents that are buying the game

40:11.820 --> 40:13.880
are absolutely clueless, this is stuff that's in there.

40:13.880 --> 40:17.280
I have watched a kid pick up Grand Theft Auto San Andreas

40:17.280 --> 40:18.440
and the parent just goes,

40:18.440 --> 40:19.800
is that something you should be playing?

40:19.800 --> 40:21.600
And the kid goes, yeah, it's fine.

40:21.600 --> 40:23.060
And the parent goes, okay, son.

40:23.060 --> 40:25.380
You know, and it's just kinda like,

40:25.380 --> 40:28.900
don't have to be a parent to recognize there's something not going there's

40:28.900 --> 40:33.020
something not right there you know if it was a movie if the movie was rated R the

40:33.020 --> 40:37.340
parent want to know why it's rated R and you know certainly I envision that one

40:37.340 --> 40:41.900
day I may have children and I have ideas on how to raise them so do I necessarily

40:41.900 --> 40:47.020
have kids myself and you know have these first-person experiences no and am I

40:47.020 --> 40:51.420
gonna be the perfect parent no because some other freakin probably if I do have

40:51.420 --> 40:56.940
kids a friend could always expose my kid to the games I don't want him to see and

40:56.940 --> 41:01.460
that's just something we've got to deal with and I say that we talk to our kids

41:01.460 --> 41:04.740
about what is and isn't appropriate in games because just like you would talk

41:04.740 --> 41:09.820
to them about you know sex and you know our rated things talk to them about it

41:09.820 --> 41:15.020
drugs all that stuff and that's the best way is to be a part of your kids life

41:15.020 --> 41:19.740
and I don't think I have to be a parent to necessarily know that I hope I don't

41:19.740 --> 41:20.860
I don't know, that's just my views.

41:20.860 --> 41:21.700
Loki?

41:21.700 --> 41:23.700
Well, games have ratings on them, just like movies

41:23.700 --> 41:24.540
have ratings on them.

41:24.540 --> 41:26.580
Say, for instance, you go see Ken Park,

41:26.580 --> 41:32.220
which has hardcore sex in it with teenagers.

41:32.220 --> 41:34.020
If your kids go and see that, and then they

41:34.020 --> 41:37.140
start going having sex, and they get pregnant,

41:37.140 --> 41:39.540
don't come crying to me because your kids are pregnant,

41:39.540 --> 41:42.220
because you made the bad decision to let them play it.

41:42.220 --> 41:43.500
Same with the game.

41:43.500 --> 41:46.820
That game is rated M, meaning anybody above 17

41:46.820 --> 41:49.360
should be able to play it, not below 17.

41:49.360 --> 41:53.560
So, if you think it's okay for your kids to play it, don't go trying to sue Rockstar because

41:53.560 --> 41:59.200
they're shooting up their school or don't go trying to say, oh they're forever ruined.

41:59.200 --> 42:02.680
You know what, you made the decision, it may have been a bad decision, but you gotta live

42:02.680 --> 42:03.680
with it.

42:03.680 --> 42:04.760
That's basically what it is.

42:04.760 --> 42:09.520
So really the people we're talking to are like dumb grandma who doesn't know anything

42:09.520 --> 42:15.760
and she is suing Rockstar because little Billy saw some polygon boob.

42:15.760 --> 42:21.540
You know what little Billy shouldn't have been playing the game and grandma should have you know, listen to the stupid little thing

42:21.540 --> 42:26.480
That's on every single game the ratings that are on there. That's why they put them on their own put it on there

42:26.480 --> 42:27.440
Just for the hell of it

42:27.440 --> 42:29.320
So, you know what?

42:29.320 --> 42:35.340
Those are the people that the people that want to put the responsibility on the game publishers the ones that are saying

42:35.340 --> 42:43.160
Oh, well, I didn't know that this this game says no over 18. I thought that my son was okay because he 13

42:43.160 --> 42:55.200
We certainly are okay with the disagreement and opinion, that's cool, and we encourage

42:55.200 --> 42:59.000
if you guys have another email, send it on over to go at orangeonstrader.com, anybody

42:59.000 --> 43:00.240
that wants to say something.

43:00.240 --> 43:04.240
Or of course, because we can only read so many emails a show, we do have the forums

43:04.240 --> 43:07.220
as well, and I'm going to be talking about that in a minute during some housekeeping.

43:07.220 --> 43:08.860
Let's get to our second email tonight.

43:08.860 --> 43:11.560
This is from rlove, is the name of the person that sent this.

43:11.560 --> 43:17.560
like that name our love sounds like a late night DJ on a AM station our love

43:17.560 --> 43:20.920
wanted to ask I just wanted to ask if you've heard anything about whether or

43:20.920 --> 43:24.920
not the current logitech wireless controllers will be able to be used on

43:24.920 --> 43:30.280
ps3 and Xbox 360 by the way josh sweden is writing and directing Wonder Woman

43:30.280 --> 43:33.520
I'm not sure what I would be more worried about how bad the movie will be

43:33.520 --> 43:38.200
or how crappy the obviously forthcoming game based on it will be it just proves

43:38.200 --> 43:42.560
once again Hollywood's total lack of creativity. On the plus side, there has to be a Linda

43:42.560 --> 43:46.360
Carter cameo in it. Anything else is sacrilege. That, of course, related to the Wonder Woman

43:46.360 --> 43:49.080
story I mentioned last week. Or was it two weeks ago? I don't remember.

43:49.080 --> 43:54.760
By the way, I read Ooey Bowl, had an interview on 1up.com this week, and he thinks that his

43:54.760 --> 43:59.820
movies are good. Whoa! There's someone who has no grasp of reality

43:59.820 --> 44:03.760
right there. Yes, I did hear about Joss Whedon doing the

44:03.760 --> 44:08.840
Wonder Woman movie or Buffy the lasso Slayer. No, I don't know. Uh, no, I liked Buffy the show

44:08.840 --> 44:14.940
I'm not hardcore about like my roommate. Just you guys know my roommate is hardcore Buffy angel fan. He hard fucking core

44:15.480 --> 44:19.260
DVDs for the record. He has the Buffy soundtrack right here on his computer desk

44:21.000 --> 44:26.620
Don't tell extra for this but he listens to the music in his car and everything and I even know the songs not that there's

44:26.620 --> 44:31.360
Anything wrong with that. I like Buffy, but I mean he's hardcore. I'm sure the movie is gonna be cool

44:31.360 --> 44:36.640
I think serenity looks pretty cool. That's a Joss Whedon thing too. Okay. He looks pretty badass, so we'll see

44:37.420 --> 44:43.820
Who knows can't really say until we start seeing some actual footage from the movie, but Joss Whedon does have that little sense of humor

44:43.820 --> 44:46.400
That's the one thing I did like about Buffy is it was very tongue-in-cheek

44:46.680 --> 44:49.960
So you know if the Wonder Woman movie it could it could benefit from that

44:50.120 --> 44:56.040
Here's the other part of the letter of course the Logitech wireless controllers being able to be used on ps3 and Xbox 360

44:56.040 --> 45:01.720
I would guess no because PS3's really changed their controller from the ground up

45:01.720 --> 45:04.200
It looks I mean the the boomerang style controller now

45:04.200 --> 45:11.280
I just think and especially now that aren't they going bluetooth as well the I don't even know I have a feeling they are

45:11.800 --> 45:15.600
Don't count on it. We don't know for sure our love, but don't count on it sadly

45:15.600 --> 45:19.280
I don't think the wireless is gonna let me put this way what here's what's gonna happen

45:19.520 --> 45:23.000
There's gonna be a third party guy out there that makes a controller

45:23.000 --> 45:27.400
that's gonna basically be able to plug in you know to some adapter or whatever

45:27.400 --> 45:31.120
and that'll be Bluetooth to whatever so you'll be able to use your Logitech

45:31.120 --> 45:35.320
wireless controller with massive lag because that's what's gonna happen you

45:35.320 --> 45:38.440
know what sadly I think you're just gonna have to upgrade your controller to

45:38.440 --> 45:42.240
one of the new wireless controllers but you know don't quote me on it I'm not on

45:42.240 --> 45:45.320
the inside I don't know for sure but I would just think because of the drastic

45:45.320 --> 45:50.520
change that both controllers are going through physically I just I don't see it

45:50.520 --> 45:56.840
happening. Yeah, that does suck because I like using my DualShock PS1 controllers with

45:56.840 --> 46:01.780
my PlayStation 2 because I was a cheap bastard. I know the Xbox 360 one can't work because

46:01.780 --> 46:05.700
they added an extra button. They added the media center button. So I just don't see it

46:05.700 --> 46:13.700
working. The Xbox 360 button is useless. It is. But it's there. The ring of light. It's

46:13.700 --> 46:19.540
just a button. Alright, again if you want to send us an email, togo, T-O-G-O at orangelaundrydo.com.

46:19.540 --> 46:22.860
Square Enix and Namco announced their lineup for the Tokyo Game Show.

46:22.860 --> 46:27.460
Namco is going to be showing Tales of the Abyss, Soulcalibur III, Critical Velocity,

46:27.460 --> 46:33.340
MotoGP4, and Urban Reign for the PS2, Ridge Racer 6, and Frame City Killer for the Xbox

46:33.340 --> 46:38.780
360, and some other games including Tales of Eternia online for the PC.

46:38.780 --> 46:43.140
Squeenix will be showing Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebras, Kingdom Hearts II, Code

46:43.140 --> 46:50.420
Age Commanders for the PS2 and on PlayStation 2, PC, and Xbox 360 Final Fantasy 11 as to

46:50.420 --> 46:54.940
what capacity they will be showing Final Fantasy 11 on 360, don't know yet.

46:54.940 --> 46:58.620
For all those waiting for Kingdom Hearts 2 to be coming out in October, guess what, it's

46:58.620 --> 46:59.620
coming out next year.

46:59.620 --> 47:00.620
Really?

47:00.620 --> 47:01.620
When did you find that out?

47:01.620 --> 47:03.980
I found that out from the Square Enix guy.

47:03.980 --> 47:05.800
I didn't even hear that announced.

47:05.800 --> 47:07.740
It's not coming out until next year.

47:07.740 --> 47:10.360
It got pushed out of this year.

47:10.360 --> 47:13.400
The big one coming out this year from Square Enix, Dragon Quest VIII.

47:13.400 --> 47:17.000
That's going to be the big one, but Kingdom Hearts, they win, buh-bye.

47:17.000 --> 47:19.120
Oh, I did not know that.

47:19.120 --> 47:20.120
That's news to me.

47:20.120 --> 47:21.120
Yep, next year.

47:21.120 --> 47:22.120
Interesting, okay.

47:22.120 --> 47:25.720
What I also thought was interesting is Square Enix is going to be showing EverQuest II because

47:25.720 --> 47:30.740
I guess they have the distribution rights overseas to that one, which I think is interesting.

47:30.740 --> 47:31.740
Notice what's missing.

47:31.740 --> 47:38.160
Front Mission 5 and, hello, Final Fantasy XII, missing from the showing list at Tokyo

47:38.160 --> 47:39.160
Game Show.

47:39.160 --> 47:42.480
I hope they...

47:42.480 --> 47:45.720
Man, don't you start to worry that the game's just going to get called off.

47:45.720 --> 47:49.880
I'd be so mad. Because the E3 demo a year and a half ago was so pretty.

47:49.880 --> 47:53.760
You know, I'm saying at this point it's probably going to be next-gen. It's gotta be.

47:53.760 --> 47:56.880
I mean, think about it, I'm probably like, ehhhhh, fine.

47:56.880 --> 48:00.160
I don't know about that. I don't know about that.

48:00.160 --> 48:04.280
Extreme Ghouls and Ghosts coming out for the PSP.

48:04.280 --> 48:08.080
That is confirmed by Famitsu Magazine. Of course,

48:08.080 --> 48:11.640
this uh... being based on the ghouls and ghosts series which dates back to the

48:11.640 --> 48:12.440
eighties

48:12.440 --> 48:16.080
uh... it was reinvented on the PS2 etcetera etcetera

48:16.080 --> 48:17.080
uh...

48:17.080 --> 48:20.840
the PSP version will have like branching paths

48:20.840 --> 48:22.880
as determined by certain warp points

48:22.880 --> 48:27.040
uh... each path having its own treasure so you can replay certain levels so you

48:27.040 --> 48:27.460
know just

48:27.460 --> 48:30.240
trying to add something a little new to the game I guess but

48:30.240 --> 48:33.760
Ghouls and Ghosts good game although it's been redone about a gazillion times but

48:33.760 --> 48:37.760
I'm still very loyal to the old Super Nintendo Super Ghouls and Ghosts

48:37.760 --> 48:41.360
so we'll see how the PSP one turns out a little later when this game comes out

48:41.360 --> 48:45.400
I guess next year I don't really see a date for this one so

48:45.400 --> 48:50.160
we'll see. I want to get into some housekeeping tonight, some various

48:50.160 --> 48:52.400
housekeeping news on tonight's podcast

48:52.400 --> 48:56.400
first off we've made some changes to the website just little little changes

48:56.400 --> 49:00.000
our forums we've actually restructured them so we have a forum

49:00.000 --> 49:03.800
strictly for podcast talk now so if you have some feedback you want to talk

49:03.800 --> 49:05.520
about something we talked on the podcast

49:05.520 --> 49:08.940
one of our stories, perhaps further discussion on Hot Coffee Mod,

49:08.940 --> 49:12.980
we encourage you to go to our forums, www.orangeonsradio.com. We have a brand new

49:12.980 --> 49:16.220
Orange on the Radio podcast forum. We're just trying to breathe some life into our forums

49:16.220 --> 49:16.500
because

49:16.500 --> 49:19.900
freaking nobody posts there, so we may have to do a giveaway or something to a

49:19.900 --> 49:24.060
random post to try and get incentive, because we like it when people post there.

49:24.060 --> 49:27.800
It gives me something to read at work when I should be working, as I'm sure a lot of you

49:27.800 --> 49:28.900
feel about it.

49:28.900 --> 49:32.140
Also, we're going to be adding to our page a links

49:32.140 --> 49:35.300
section that will be specific for each podcast.

49:35.300 --> 49:37.860
So some popular links that we talk about,

49:37.860 --> 49:39.140
because a lot of folks have been complaining,

49:39.140 --> 49:41.100
well, you read these links and they're huge,

49:41.100 --> 49:42.500
and we have no way to find these sites.

49:42.500 --> 49:44.360
So we're gonna add a links section

49:44.360 --> 49:46.380
that we can index the links by podcast.

49:46.380 --> 49:48.340
And I actually wanna give you a couple links

49:48.340 --> 49:50.820
that have to do with some show things.

49:50.820 --> 49:52.380
First one is one of our listeners.

49:52.380 --> 49:54.780
One of our listeners, the guy that goes by DJ Ranma S,

49:54.780 --> 49:56.060
who lives out on the East Coast,

49:56.060 --> 49:58.480
he actually has a really creative idea

49:58.480 --> 50:00.140
for Hurricane Katrina relief.

50:00.140 --> 50:03.460
And of course, Hurricane Katrina was a huge impact

50:03.460 --> 50:06.500
this past week and we know we had some very close listeners,

50:06.500 --> 50:08.540
some long time fans of Orange Launch Radio

50:08.540 --> 50:12.860
dating back to, when did we start this thing, 2002?

50:12.860 --> 50:15.260
Back to 2002 when we first started with the live station,

50:15.260 --> 50:16.920
we're affected and lost everything.

50:16.920 --> 50:20.520
And we just, it's so horrible to hear about

50:20.520 --> 50:21.780
and I don't want to get into,

50:21.780 --> 50:23.360
I don't want to get into grim details

50:23.360 --> 50:24.820
because you're here to hear about video games.

50:24.820 --> 50:28.700
But I think what DJ Rama S is doing is really cool.

50:28.700 --> 50:32.000
as you guys know, I'm sure you've seen on many of the popular websites, you can donate

50:32.000 --> 50:35.780
to the Red Cross, but maybe you're thinking, gosh, I don't really have money to give to

50:35.780 --> 50:41.260
the Red Cross. Well, DJ Rama S is actually really big in the cosplay community, so he

50:41.260 --> 50:46.400
thought, well, what do we do in the cosplay community? We're constantly taking clothes

50:46.400 --> 50:50.300
and remaking clothes, and therefore we go through a lot of old clothes. So why don't

50:50.300 --> 50:54.100
we gather up old clothes and give them to Salvation Army, because, you know, these people,

50:54.100 --> 50:57.960
some of them are without the bare essentials right now. So I like this idea, he's calling

50:57.960 --> 51:02.880
at Project Relief and they're trying to collect clothes and just anything you want to give

51:02.880 --> 51:07.300
at various sites. They're doing this a lot on the East Coast but they're trying to organize

51:07.300 --> 51:13.200
collection spots throughout the country. Check it out. It's djrondmas.net slash html slash

51:13.200 --> 51:17.520
project underscore relief dot html. We will of course put a link. I know, see that's such

51:17.520 --> 51:20.960
a huge link. We're going to put a link on orangelaundry.com so you guys can check that

51:20.960 --> 51:26.160
out. So thank you Rond Masse for putting that together and we'll see what we can put together

51:26.160 --> 51:30.300
is a donation for that I think that's a great idea also I this is one of those

51:30.300 --> 51:34.140
things I should have mentioned last week on the show but there's an independent

51:34.140 --> 51:37.820
record label that actually started up in the Sacramento area and they do kind of

51:37.820 --> 51:43.820
goth industrial style music which if you're into UltraMix 2 or DDR UltraMix 3

51:43.820 --> 51:48.420
lately seems to be having quite a bit of that and actually the administrator of

51:48.420 --> 51:55.220
the DDR freaks forums iguana girl is actually throwing her hat into the ring

51:55.220 --> 51:58.840
of this company and we've actually been kind of cross-promoting each other a little bit

51:58.840 --> 52:03.140
so I wanted to give them a shout out. They just released a brand new CD called Blood

52:03.140 --> 52:07.580
and Synth, a compilation. It's the first CD on the label and it just came out this past

52:07.580 --> 52:16.900
week. Check out their site, www.darkrecordsnclothing.com. Not and, but the letter N. Darkrecordsnclothing.com.

52:16.900 --> 52:19.620
So good luck to those guys. Support independent music, guys.

52:19.620 --> 52:24.780
Funny enough, I was just talking to my friend earlier today who lives up around this area

52:24.780 --> 52:30.100
he had mentioned like a co-worker being a DJ and saying yeah his name's DJ

52:30.100 --> 52:34.500
illogical beats and he has this thing coming out with the blood and synth I'm

52:34.500 --> 52:37.700
like I read that on a friend's live journal on the guana girls actually no

52:37.700 --> 52:41.860
less and I was like wow man this world just gets smaller and smaller amazing

52:41.860 --> 52:48.340
yeah he's a co-worker of his Wow that's very cool and right heaven bacon man all

52:48.340 --> 52:51.000
right check that out you guys we definitely want to support the

52:51.000 --> 52:54.740
independent record labels and especially the ones have been supporting us so

52:54.740 --> 52:56.420
So check that out.

52:56.420 --> 52:58.820
All right, let's go into some more news tonight here

52:58.820 --> 53:00.680
to wrap up tonight's show.

53:00.680 --> 53:05.680
Metal Slug 6 is coming out on SNK Playmore.

53:06.140 --> 53:07.960
I'm sorry is the name of the company now.

53:07.960 --> 53:10.740
They showed this off at the 43rd Amusement Machine Show

53:10.740 --> 53:12.140
which happened in Tokyo.

53:13.000 --> 53:15.580
Although it was actually at Sega's booth.

53:15.580 --> 53:18.680
It's the seventh installment in the Metal Slug series

53:18.680 --> 53:21.260
because of Metal Slug X.

53:21.260 --> 53:24.340
and uh... it's being developed for sammy's

53:24.340 --> 53:27.500
a thomas wave platform which would of course be

53:27.500 --> 53:30.780
a little bit different than the neo geo arcade system you used to so this is a

53:30.780 --> 53:33.940
new arcade game that's coming out

53:33.940 --> 53:37.700
metal metal slug six i know there's a lot of metal slugs fans out there so i

53:37.700 --> 53:38.540
just thought i'd

53:38.540 --> 53:42.340
kinda tip my hat at that game let me just say whoop-de-doo

53:42.340 --> 53:45.860
hey last metal slug games have been all the same

53:45.860 --> 53:50.740
except for metal slug 3d which was interesting i don't know if that ever even came out

53:50.740 --> 53:53.580
You know what I did see though, that they were showing at, I think it was at Tokyo Game

53:53.580 --> 53:56.920
Show actually, um, Mario Kart, um...

53:56.920 --> 54:00.440
Tokyo Game Show hasn't happened yet, so, are you thinking, oh, you're thinking of the amusement

54:00.440 --> 54:03.420
show, the amusement show, whatever, the one that Street Fighter IV was supposed to be

54:03.420 --> 54:04.420
at and didn't happen?

54:04.420 --> 54:05.420
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

54:05.420 --> 54:07.340
Uh, they showed the new Mario Kart arcade game.

54:07.340 --> 54:08.340
Hot!

54:08.340 --> 54:09.340
Oh yeah, hot!

54:09.340 --> 54:11.260
Oh yeah, that's some good stuff right there.

54:11.260 --> 54:12.260
Can't wait.

54:12.260 --> 54:13.260
Anyways.

54:13.260 --> 54:18.660
Sweet Codin' 5 is on its way, and a playable demo of the game will be available at Tokyo

54:18.660 --> 54:22.960
game show September 16th through 18th Suikoden 5 taking place in the

54:22.960 --> 54:28.500
queendom of Felina a kingdom which was referred to a few times in the previous

54:28.500 --> 54:33.800
games don't know quite about the time frame Suikoden 5 but I hear it's gonna

54:33.800 --> 54:37.520
be pretty good I hear if you were disappointed by Suikoden 4 Suikoden 5

54:37.520 --> 54:41.680
will make things better that of course coming out for the PlayStation 2 it will

54:41.680 --> 54:43.980
not be a next-gen game it's gonna be PlayStation 2 you also have to figure

54:43.980 --> 54:47.240
that Suikoden Tactics is going to be in there somewhere right so Suikoden

54:47.240 --> 54:53.540
big thing for Konami right now, unlock all those million characters that are in the game.

54:53.540 --> 54:56.700
Advent Children, Final Fantasy VII Advent Children is going to be getting its own title

54:56.700 --> 55:02.100
song. Of course, title songs being a big thing in Square Games, you know, Simple and Clean,

55:02.100 --> 55:06.620
Eyes on Me, you know. Advent Children, even though it's not a game, it's a movie, has

55:06.620 --> 55:13.420
its own song. Kyusuke Himiro with Calling, but the weird thing is, it's actually from

55:13.420 --> 55:21.420
his 1989 album Neofasiko, but that's the theme song and supposedly says the Advent

55:21.420 --> 55:25.620
Children director Tetsuya Nomura for the setting of Advent Children it's very

55:25.620 --> 55:31.900
fitting so an old 80s classic may his way I got another email the other day

55:31.900 --> 55:39.420
saying it's gonna be November 30th or 29th so November 29th like I said before

55:39.420 --> 55:44.500
interesting son of a bitch they pushed it back but you know was the soundtrack

55:44.500 --> 55:49.020
supposedly being released September 28th well good for them you know but all I'm

55:49.020 --> 55:53.780
hoping is a man all I'm hoping is to see a copy well it's linked to the internet

55:53.780 --> 55:58.980
which will be like the day of or the day after so all right for those you guys

55:58.980 --> 56:04.900
that were kind of ticked off at Xbox 360s you know dual level pricing thing

56:04.900 --> 56:10.380
going on. PlayStation 3 would just like you to know, well at least on British website

56:10.380 --> 56:18.180
gamesindustry.biz, sorry, Sony Computer Entertainment Europe Vice President Phil Harrison said doing

56:18.180 --> 56:23.740
that multiple pricing level for PlayStation 3? Unlikely. So you don't have to worry about

56:23.740 --> 56:27.380
this. You'll just be shelling out 500 bucks for the PlayStation 3 to start. No, I'm kidding.

56:27.380 --> 56:31.900
I'm kidding. I don't know. I don't know. Well, let me just put it this way. It's not going

56:31.900 --> 56:33.180
to be cheap

56:33.180 --> 56:37.100
uh... also says phil harrison are there two versions of the xbox three sixty

56:37.100 --> 56:38.980
that people want to buy i don't know

56:38.980 --> 56:42.500
i look at those formats i think it just confuses the audience

56:42.500 --> 56:44.900
they don't know which one to buy developers don't know which one to

56:44.900 --> 56:48.440
create for and retailers don't know which one to stock

56:48.440 --> 56:52.660
so i think we would take that strategy we wouldn't want to create. They made some huge

56:52.660 --> 56:55.140
mistakes doing the double skews on those

56:55.140 --> 56:59.160
uh... first one being is now there's no guarantee that there's going to be a hard drive in there

56:59.160 --> 57:00.700
Developers can't develop their games

57:00.700 --> 57:02.620
with hard drive support.

57:02.620 --> 57:04.380
The other thing that they made a mistake on

57:04.380 --> 57:06.540
is that there's only a DVD drive in there,

57:06.540 --> 57:08.520
not like any next-gen format.

57:09.700 --> 57:13.700
They're running out of space on the DVDs to put the games.

57:13.700 --> 57:16.460
They're gonna run into a lot of hurdles with this thing,

57:16.460 --> 57:18.700
and it's not looking good.

57:18.700 --> 57:19.860
We'll see, we'll see.

57:21.100 --> 57:24.060
King of Fighters just came out this week for the Xbox.

57:24.060 --> 57:26.620
Just kinda wanted to tip our hat at that one.

57:26.620 --> 57:30.300
2002 and 2003 editions coming out for the Xbox.

57:30.300 --> 57:31.840
By the way, it was actually already released

57:31.840 --> 57:35.140
for the PlayStation 2, but this has Xbox Live support.

57:35.140 --> 57:38.580
So, for those of you guys that are into King of Fart,

57:38.580 --> 57:40.160
did I say King of Farters?

57:40.160 --> 57:41.520
Sorry, King of Farters?

57:42.640 --> 57:45.300
Yeah, we're definitely running late here on the show.

57:46.200 --> 57:49.940
Sony, possibly also, by the way,

57:49.940 --> 57:51.580
something that was said by Phil Harrison,

57:51.580 --> 57:53.080
boy, this guy's got a big mouth lately,

57:53.080 --> 57:54.740
but that's good, we like guys with big mouths,

57:54.740 --> 57:57.900
because it gives us a hint to what these companies are thinking.

57:57.900 --> 58:03.740
Possibly charging for PSP downloads in 2006.

58:03.740 --> 58:09.860
Saying that possibly Wipeout Pure was kind of like a test case for something that could

58:09.860 --> 58:10.860
be coming in the future.

58:10.860 --> 58:15.180
He says, it's an experiment which has turned out to be a good experiment.

58:15.180 --> 58:17.980
That quote coming from UK's Edge magazine.

58:17.980 --> 58:18.980
No.

58:18.980 --> 58:19.980
What, Loki?

58:19.980 --> 58:20.980
You're saying no.

58:20.980 --> 58:21.980
No.

58:21.980 --> 58:22.980
Why no?

58:22.980 --> 58:23.980
That's a dumb idea.

58:23.980 --> 58:30.200
Well let me put it this way, with Wipeout you could actually download, well for example

58:30.200 --> 58:35.140
here's a perfect example, you can emulate basically make it look like that your web

58:35.140 --> 58:39.020
browser is a PSP and download that program, oh hey look at there, there's a file that

58:39.020 --> 58:41.940
I can transfer to any PSP.

58:41.940 --> 58:45.580
It's gonna be so freaking easy to pirate that stuff, it's not even funny.

58:45.580 --> 58:48.420
I mean there's all the Wipeout downloads that are out there, you can get them from their

58:48.420 --> 58:51.360
websites or you can get them from any other website that happens to be holding them.

58:51.360 --> 58:53.880
So I don't know.

58:53.880 --> 58:59.080
I know what they're trying to do, but I don't think it's going to work.

58:59.080 --> 59:04.160
Last story tonight, the last story, Bungie, the folks behind Halo getting into the Hurricane

59:04.160 --> 59:05.160
Katrina relief.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.160
This is pretty cool.

59:06.160 --> 59:10.840
They've created a custom t-shirt, and the custom t-shirt shows a little master chief,

59:10.840 --> 59:14.160
and he looks like he's kind of kicking some hurricane butt there.

59:14.160 --> 59:16.800
Like literally, I don't know what that's, it actually looks like a giant cotton ball

59:16.800 --> 59:19.560
with teeth, but I think it's supposed to be a hurricane.

59:19.560 --> 59:23.280
it saying fight the flood and they're selling this little custom shirt trying

59:23.280 --> 59:26.800
to get you know gamers to show support they're saying that roughly fifteen

59:26.800 --> 59:31.200
dollars of each shirt sold will go directly to the hurricane relief effort

59:31.200 --> 59:35.840
so if you're interested in checking that out head on over to a bungee.net and

59:35.840 --> 59:38.480
check that out we'll also of course provide a link to that on our new links

59:38.480 --> 59:46.120
page so that's that the other thing about speaking a little bit about Xbox

59:46.120 --> 59:52.960
here origin xbox or origin xbox 360 another viral site the countdown is gonna be done

59:52.960 --> 59:58.360
on monday the 26th of this month so we'll know what that is apparently bunnies keep

59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.960
appearing disappearing i really don't give a crap about the bunnies and the tree and

01:00:01.960 --> 01:00:07.280
the hole and whatever other crap that's on the tree i'm just hoping it's a release date

01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:11.880
which they're saying is gonna be no later than black friday which if it's released on

01:00:11.880 --> 01:00:18.040
Black Friday, in other words, the biggest shopping day of the year after Thanksgiving,

01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:19.880
that's going to fucking suck.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:25.840
All I know is I was smart this time and did not pre-book my system at the mall.

01:00:25.840 --> 01:00:31.200
I did a really small game stop that's nearby my house so I can go pick it up and leave.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.200
Sounds good.

01:00:32.200 --> 01:00:34.560
Alright, wow, we broke an hour tonight, kids.

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:36.400
Our first podcast over an hour in length.

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.960
It's definitely time to wrap it up.

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:39.240
We just have a lot to say.

01:00:39.240 --> 01:00:41.400
And plus, you know, we've been doing a little drinking, so we're rambling.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:45.260
responsibly kids don't drink and drive I won't uh let's go around and get

01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.580
everybody's final thoughts Mel B thank you for being here tonight appreciate

you kind of filling in for Dark Sakura the last time of the show well thanks

01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:55.660
for having me I mean I guess being the first guest on the podcast you know this

01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:59.260
means something I mean see wasn't I there for like the first orange lounge

01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:03.780
promo as well you one of our first promo you were there like probably within the

01:01:03.780 --> 01:01:08.820
first two months of our live program way back in 2002 so so you know as we say in

01:01:08.820 --> 01:01:14.000
I ain't new to it. I'm true to it. Well, we appreciate you being loyal to us. Thank you very much

01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.200
And thank you for your tips earlier on tonight on the game industry. Oh, yeah, definitely a no problem, man

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:24.280
Um, hopefully I'll be back for another show, you know be a podcaster live and of course, you know

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.080
I'll probably be bringing in a couple more new CDs along

01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:30.960
Well, you didn't touch on that on the pod not on the podcast, but we did talk about it on

01:01:31.720 --> 01:01:34.560
Another program that we do for orange launch radio

01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:42.120
The new CDs by Zonk and Orifiz which are going to be actually part of

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:45.780
UltraMix 3. Actually I'm not sure about Zonk's involvement in UltraMix 3 but

01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:50.520
Orifiz being one of them. Yeah Orifiz is definitely a Basile. This song will be in

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:55.360
UltraMix 3. I had talked to Dave who is the guy behind Orifiz and actually is

01:01:55.360 --> 01:01:58.720
also one of the musicians on Zonk and he said that they're looking into a

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.960
possible download for a future song. I mean yeah I've gotten to hear them. I

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.680
I actually got to see them in concert a couple times,

01:02:06.680 --> 01:02:07.840
just in the past couple months.

01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:09.680
They're actually gonna be taking a break from touring

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:13.000
because the lead singer is actually having a baby.

01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000
Oh, nice.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:14.840
Yeah.

01:02:14.840 --> 01:02:15.660
Very cool.

01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.200

Ah, stop me.

01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:11.180
Anyways, anyway, okay. We're supposed to go on white water rafting in the spring, which

01:03:11.180 --> 01:03:18.100
is interesting. How's that for company relationships? But no, it was really fun. I enjoyed talking

01:03:18.100 --> 01:03:23.160
with them. I talked their ears off about their product and I'm glad that I had someone to

01:03:23.160 --> 01:03:26.820
talk to who I actually understood what I was talking to. Well, hopefully they understood.

01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:33.240
It was just fun and really I got to learn a lot of stuff and make those connections

01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:38.820
that we really needed to make and hopefully Daniel at Konami is going to be sending me

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:44.020
those V-Rares for Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:46.820
And hopefully some of these companies will listen to your pleas for prizes that we're

01:03:46.820 --> 01:03:48.260
going to turn around to our listeners.

01:03:48.260 --> 01:03:50.700
Yeah, we plug a lot of the games out here.

01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:55.700
We talk about everything that comes out and everything and it's really cool and I love

01:03:55.700 --> 01:03:59.100
playing everything out there I play whatever I get my hands on so

01:03:59.100 --> 01:04:02.740
