04:41.280 --> 04:46.380
You just made me think of Cinnabon. Oh, damn. I hunger for Cinnabon right now. I found really

04:46.380 --> 04:52.220
good cinnamon bread. And I need an Ethernet cable, please. You know why Cinnabon pisses

04:52.220 --> 04:57.900

tech master Loki yes I'm I'm here and I destroy twin B with Optimus Prime we've

05:19.820 --> 05:24.420
We've got to talk about this game later on. That game was the shit.

05:24.420 --> 05:28.800
Well, we'll talk about some various stuff tonight. Of course we've got a little bit of

05:28.800 --> 05:33.820
Bimani news to talk about. Well, I don't know if it's so much a little bit, but the V-Rare is out.

05:33.820 --> 05:39.820
We were going to play it for you guys tonight, except I couldn't get my hands on it, and I'm going to tell you about what happened there,

05:39.820 --> 05:44.820
because it's kind of a funny story. We'll tell you about that. Loki's supposed to be getting a copy of it from inside Konami, but...

05:44.820 --> 05:48.820
And also Ultramix 3's vrare, which we'll have first, hopefully.

05:48.820 --> 05:49.320
Hopefully.

05:49.320 --> 05:49.820
Hopefully.

05:49.820 --> 05:50.820
The guy better hurry up.

05:50.820 --> 05:52.820
Daniel's gotta hurry up, so.

05:52.820 --> 05:53.820
Hopefully.

05:55.820 --> 06:01.820
Well, we'll have those soon, so we'll play those for you guys, but a lot of you guys have been getting your grubby little hands on the vrare, so we'll talk about the vrare.

06:01.820 --> 06:05.820
We're gonna talk about some other stuff, too, going on in Konami's world.

06:05.820 --> 06:10.820
Really cute little Akira Yamaoka teaser I saw that I have to show you guys. It's so cute.

06:10.820 --> 06:13.820
And who knows what else we'll talk about tonight.

06:13.820 --> 06:18.820
We also have a special guest in the studio who just joined us. Say hello to Bugd!

06:18.820 --> 06:21.820
I had to finish cracking out on Burnout Legends there.

06:21.820 --> 06:22.820
That's fine.

06:22.820 --> 06:23.820
Uh oh, bye Loki!

06:23.820 --> 06:25.820
Is he going to pick up the game then?

06:25.820 --> 06:26.820
Probably.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.820
Alright.

06:27.820 --> 06:30.820
We're going to go to a break.

06:30.820 --> 06:35.820
I think we're going to start off this break with a song from a v-rare that will just...

06:35.820 --> 06:41.820
I don't think any v-rare that ever comes out in the future will ever be able to compare to this v-rare because it was so damn good.

06:41.820 --> 06:43.820
And that's Ultramix 2's V-Rare.

06:43.820 --> 06:46.320
So we're going to play some songs from Ultramix 2's V-Rare.

06:46.320 --> 06:49.320
Uh, started off with a little bit of, um,

06:49.320 --> 06:51.820
Neuropa, because I like Neuropa, they're cool.

06:51.820 --> 06:53.820
Gee, weren't we listening to Neuropa last night?

06:53.820 --> 06:57.320
Yes we were, so we're going to hear them right now, with standing still in time.

06:57.320 --> 06:59.320
We'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

06:59.320 --> 07:03.320
Join our chat room, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

07:03.320 --> 07:05.320
Click on chat. See you there.

07:33.320 --> 07:39.320
All my fading memories, back to where it all began

07:39.320 --> 07:46.320
So much there I understand, as I look now

07:46.320 --> 07:53.320
To a distance far away, I will cross a million lines

07:53.320 --> 07:56.320
Now I'm standing still in time

07:56.320 --> 08:02.820
Still inside, still inside

08:02.820 --> 08:09.820
Still inside, still inside

09:09.820 --> 09:14.820
Let me breathe

09:14.820 --> 09:21.820
Let me open it to me

09:21.820 --> 09:27.820
You fly, let me breathe

09:27.820 --> 09:35.820
Let me know that I'm with you

10:35.820 --> 10:43.820
Call me Nacha, I'm a cyber messenger, wack it in

10:43.820 --> 10:47.820
Bit away, call me edge, I'm a kung fu monster

10:47.820 --> 10:49.820
Beat away, you can't sweat, cause I'm evil first

10:49.820 --> 10:52.820
In between, betray, who the what, must gotcha

10:52.820 --> 10:54.820
Control your mess and I'll sway you man down

10:54.820 --> 10:56.820
Deep in the sweat, there's a wire goin' on

10:56.820 --> 10:59.820
Put your mask to the beat, call me Nacha

10:59.820 --> 11:01.820
Don't you draw, keep your space, where the end

11:01.820 --> 11:04.820
I'm a cyber messenger, wack it in

11:04.820 --> 11:09.320
Yeah, then I drop to the next zone, you know, that I don't grow, come and grow, to the end, I

11:09.320 --> 11:13.820
Yeah, then I drop to the next zone, you walkin' in, breakin' in, to the same time we nacha

11:15.320 --> 11:18.820
Call me nacha, talk to draw, keep it speed with the end

11:19.820 --> 11:22.320
Call me nacha, drop out of throw, come and grow

11:22.320 --> 11:27.320
Baby, better wait, call me edge, I'm a conquer monster, be the way you can sweat, tell the people first

11:27.320 --> 11:32.320
In between, betray, who the what must capture, who the who want your mess around, pull away your makeup

13:32.320 --> 13:38.320
The words are saying, baby, I found my soul

13:38.320 --> 13:42.320
And it keeps me hanging on

13:42.320 --> 13:45.320
Understand me now

13:45.320 --> 13:50.320
The frequency of the beat gets higher

13:52.320 --> 13:56.320
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon

13:56.320 --> 13:58.320
No!

13:58.320 --> 14:02.400
Just kidding. Orange Lounge Radio. Crap-free Bhavani Radio.

14:02.400 --> 14:06.280
Hey kids, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio.

14:06.280 --> 14:10.200
Episode number 155 here in progress. Yes, that's right.

14:10.200 --> 14:13.720
We are actually live tonight. I'm so freaking excited.

14:13.720 --> 14:18.000
We are off for a couple weeks there. One week was our choice. We were gone for a

14:18.000 --> 14:20.960
week because, hey, you know what? We deserve a vacation once in a while.

14:20.960 --> 14:24.680
And actually, secretly, some things are going on behind the scenes including

14:24.680 --> 14:29.260
Jamie's Bachelorette party happened to be the same night, but that was cool because I got to go

14:29.260 --> 14:33.400
I was the only guy at Jamie's Bachelorette party, but it was fun. I had a good time

14:34.040 --> 14:37.000
That's because you're special and I saw Xanadu for the first time

14:37.360 --> 14:43.380
No, you need to sit down and watch Xanadu all the way through from beginning to end. That movie is awesome. Bring earplugs

14:44.340 --> 14:48.320
No, I like the music in Xanadu. That actually was like one of the only things that made it worth it

14:48.320 --> 14:57.320
The interesting thing about Xanadu, and I know a lot of you guys probably only know Xanadu from, you know, that song that was in DDR Third Mix.

14:57.320 --> 15:01.320
Wait, I'm trying to play a clip here. There we go.

15:01.320 --> 15:08.320
This is the first song a lot of people played in DDR.

15:08.320 --> 15:12.320
It starts with an X. An X is always better.

15:12.320 --> 15:16.320
Notice it's a one-footer. The Olivia Project. Queen of the one-footers.

15:16.320 --> 15:20.320
Um, anyway. So Xanadu's like this old-ass movie. Well, not that old.

15:20.320 --> 15:24.320
I mean, I was alive, but it can't be that old. 1980.

15:24.320 --> 15:28.320
That movie is... 25 years old. Wow.

15:28.320 --> 15:32.320
Had Gene Kelly in it. Yeah, so what it was trying to do was trying to be like a throwback

15:32.320 --> 15:36.320
to, like, old cinema, where they would, you know, sing and dance

15:36.320 --> 15:40.320
in the middle of it, and the plot was very thin, but that's okay, because

15:40.320 --> 15:43.840
was all about the music that was kind of like the idea but the plot was about

15:43.840 --> 15:49.360
wanting to open up a roller disco and Olivia Newton-John was the muse the plot

15:49.360 --> 15:55.680
was about a guy who lost his inspiration and she was the muse I see see I'll show

15:55.680 --> 15:58.580
you how much how much I was paying attention to the evidence because you

15:58.580 --> 16:02.160
came in and did you see the animated part yes I did I love the animated part

16:02.160 --> 16:06.440
it's Don Bluth Studios and Don Bluth owned to give it a video game connection

16:06.440 --> 16:13.640
did Dragon's Lair, Space A. Same guy who did that stuff, and Dragon's Lair is awesome.

16:13.640 --> 16:17.780
Even though Dragon's Lair was ridiculously simple and kind of, like, as a game itself

16:17.780 --> 16:24.880
it was kind of stupid, like, the interactive cartoon feature of it made it so worth it.

16:24.880 --> 16:29.080
The technology at the time was pretty nifty. It was kick-ass. Well, hell, I can sit here

16:29.080 --> 16:33.740
and pay a quarter to control a laserdisc. That's really bad. Well, think about it.

16:33.740 --> 16:41.180
We never got a perfect copy of Dragon's Lair at home until DVD players.

16:41.180 --> 16:45.180
Or if you are into the emulation scene, the Daphne emulator.

16:45.180 --> 16:51.500
Okay, true, but I should say a blessed copy of it.

16:51.500 --> 16:52.500
Novellma?

16:52.500 --> 16:53.500
I'm not...

16:53.500 --> 16:54.500
Oh.

16:54.500 --> 16:55.500
Scooby?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.500
No.

16:56.500 --> 16:59.860
You say Scooby, I think Buffy, so...

16:59.860 --> 17:00.860
No.

17:00.860 --> 17:06.980
Anyway, so we were off two weeks ago because of that.

17:06.980 --> 17:11.740
We had the Bachelorette party going on, which, by the way, was one of the more girly things

17:11.740 --> 17:18.580
I'd seen in a while, and you know, being the gay guy, I got the inside look at what girls

17:18.580 --> 17:20.140
really do when they get together.

17:20.140 --> 17:23.900
We also had Barbarella, the parts of it anyway.

17:23.900 --> 17:26.060
A little bit of it, which was, now that movie is stupid.

17:26.060 --> 17:30.220
We missed the death by orgasm scene.

17:30.220 --> 17:32.620
And Jessica made us skip the doll scene, which-

17:32.620 --> 17:35.300
No, I made us skip the doll scene.

17:35.300 --> 17:36.300
One of you two made us skip the doll scene.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.220
I had nightmares about the doll scene.

17:38.220 --> 17:39.660
The doll scene looked cool.

17:39.660 --> 17:40.660
Anyway.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.300
We'll watch it all the way through one day.

17:42.300 --> 17:46.420
I keep mishearing that as dollzine from like Street Fighter, I'm like, where's the dollzine?

17:46.420 --> 17:47.420
Yoga!

17:47.420 --> 17:48.420
Yoga!

17:48.420 --> 17:49.420
Yoga fire!

17:49.420 --> 17:54.260
Death by yoga.

17:54.260 --> 17:55.620
Yoga flame.

17:55.620 --> 18:00.620
Anyway, last week, we were all here. We had a shitload of people in the studio, too.

18:00.620 --> 18:06.620
We had, uh, Mikolatov was here, uh, Pixie Dust was here, the Orange Launch Madam, who hadn't been here in like a year and a half,

18:06.620 --> 18:16.620
and her, uh, fiancÃ© now, or long-time boyfriend, one of the two, no stylin' was here, and, uh, Mel B was here, and we couldn't do a show, because...

18:16.620 --> 18:17.620
And we were drinking.

18:17.620 --> 18:20.620
And we were drinking. We were quite intoxicated last week.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.620
I had three Guinnesses.

18:22.620 --> 18:28.140
And Live 365, due to some error after their maintenance window, they do regular maintenance

18:28.140 --> 18:34.460
on Saturday nights now, but they did some stupid error afterwards that caused nobody

18:34.460 --> 18:39.340
on Live 365 to be able to carry a live show, which pissed some people off royally because

18:39.340 --> 18:43.940
there's some stations out there that run live all the time, which, you know, one day in

18:43.940 --> 18:48.020
a more perfect world, I would like to be able to have Orange Lounge live all the time.

18:48.020 --> 18:52.340
We'll see, you know, something we can look at for 2006.

18:52.340 --> 18:57.540
But it kind of pissed some people off that they did that, so needless to say, a lot of

18:57.540 --> 19:01.660
listeners complain, a lot of broadcasters complain, Live 365 will be very careful about

19:01.660 --> 19:06.140
those sorts of things in the future, so we'll see.

19:06.140 --> 19:09.500
Anyway, so now we're here this week after two weeks of no show.

19:09.500 --> 19:12.140
Those of you guys that are members of our live journal community, you did get a show

19:12.140 --> 19:14.980
last week, so that's all I can say about that.

19:14.980 --> 19:20.860
I know we have some people listening for the first time tonight because of our podcast

19:20.860 --> 19:21.940
has still been going.

19:21.940 --> 19:25.060
know, we did a podcast last week, even though we were slightly intoxicated, which I don't

19:25.060 --> 19:28.380
think we really advertised on the podcast, that we were drunk when we were doing it,

19:28.380 --> 19:34.900
or at least a little buzzed. At the beginning I think we mentioned it, but we didn't really

19:34.900 --> 19:39.180
like, we weren't quite vocal about it as we usually are on the live show when we have

19:39.180 --> 19:44.300
to react. Disclaimer, alcohol present. Something like that was basically the thing. But we

19:44.300 --> 19:47.940
were quite intoxicated doing the show, but I have to hand it to us, and listening to

19:47.940 --> 19:52.020
the playback of the show, we did a pretty good job considering how much we'd all had

19:52.020 --> 19:53.020
to drink.

19:53.020 --> 19:56.540
I was laying down in the chair with a beer in my hand.

19:56.540 --> 19:58.020
You left halfway through, too.

19:58.020 --> 19:59.020
I had to.

19:59.020 --> 20:00.020
You guys just let Mel B talk.

20:00.020 --> 20:01.020
He sounded pretty damn sober.

20:01.020 --> 20:02.020
Mel B was sober!

20:02.020 --> 20:09.700
Okay, that would be why he didn't sound that drunk.

20:09.700 --> 20:15.440
So we did the podcast, and we have new people listening tonight because we have the podcast.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.220
And I know a lot of folks are saying that they're actually loading up their Live 365

20:19.220 --> 20:22.440
stream in iTunes, especially now because you know iTunes 5 is out and all that stuff.

20:22.440 --> 20:24.020
So iTunes is very cool.

20:24.020 --> 20:26.060
Don't get me wrong, iTunes is a great program.

20:26.060 --> 20:27.060
I use it myself.

20:27.060 --> 20:30.920
However, I just want to warn you guys that Orange House Radio is presented in what's

20:30.920 --> 20:40.440
called MP3 Pro, and iTunes does not support MP3 Pro, at least unless there's something

20:40.440 --> 20:44.460
new in iTunes 5 I wasn't aware of, but as far as I know, they still don't support MP3

20:44.460 --> 20:49.100
because it's an actual codec that you download as a plugin for Winamp, or I think there's

20:49.100 --> 20:52.160
a couple other programs that support it, but of course Winamp, I mean if you're not using

20:52.160 --> 20:57.680
iTunes you're probably using Winamp, or unless you got some other thing going on, which there's

20:57.680 --> 21:02.660
probably an MP3 codec for it. I think Media Player supports it now. Oh, Windows Media

21:02.660 --> 21:06.700
Player? I think so. Maybe. Anyway, if you want more information on MP3 Pro, you can

21:06.700 --> 21:12.280
visit our website, it's at orangehonestradio.com and check the FAQ. Now, I don't want to discourage

21:12.280 --> 21:16.240
you guys from listening in iTunes because we will sound normal through iTunes except

21:16.240 --> 21:22.320
we sound a little better with the MP3 Pro codec. It's broadband radio at a dial-up connection

21:22.320 --> 21:25.720
because MP3 Pro does something to the header or something where it encodes...

21:25.720 --> 21:31.080
It adds ten years of maturity. Basically, yeah. So, anyway. Although I did

21:31.080 --> 21:35.320
download iTunes 5, it's kind of cool. The only thing I didn't understand about iTunes

21:35.320 --> 21:39.960
5 is it really wasn't that much different from 4.9 except for they changed the store

21:39.960 --> 21:41.880
And the look?

21:41.880 --> 21:45.560
A little bit. But the look and feel, it's not like they change the colors or they

21:45.560 --> 21:46.720
change the

21:46.720 --> 21:51.360
way the buttons look or anything. They just kind of change. Well, now it's more square instead of rounded.

21:51.360 --> 21:55.680
But I mean, it's cool and all. So is the Mac now, you know. Don't get me wrong. I like iTunes

21:55.680 --> 21:59.400
and iTunes 5 is cool and all, I guess. And it does the Outlook sync, I guess, which is cool if

21:59.400 --> 22:01.560
you're into using Outlook, which I don't.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.480
Outlook sync?

22:03.480 --> 22:09.000
It syncs your contacts on your iPod with Microsoft Outlook.

22:09.000 --> 22:12.000
If that's something that appeals to you, you could go do that.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.000
I use Pine.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.000
I use Pine.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.000
For your email?

22:19.000 --> 22:21.000
Pine and Gmail, that's my two...

22:21.000 --> 22:22.000
Yeah.

22:22.000 --> 22:24.000
That's pretty hardcore.

22:26.000 --> 22:29.000
Listeners in the chat room, blah blah blah, listening to some comments here.

22:29.000 --> 22:32.000
Live365 needs to support AAC.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.000
You're not the first person to suggest that,

22:34.000 --> 22:38.000
and some folks have actually suggested that to Live365 directly.

22:38.000 --> 22:44.000
I think that would be kind of cool because I think AAC has better encryption. You know what else has really good encryption is OGG.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
And I'd like to see-

22:45.000 --> 22:46.000
Encryption or compression?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.000
Compression. What am I saying?

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Okay.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.000
Someone just said OGG.

22:49.000 --> 22:52.000
Someone just said OGG. Oh, there it is. Yeah. OGG.

22:52.000 --> 22:59.000
And there has been talk amongst, you know, are we going to stay with Li-365? Are we not going to stay with Li-365?

22:59.000 --> 23:06.000
The problem- well, I guess I should say, Li-365 up until last week has actually been pretty damn good.

23:06.000 --> 23:10.360
good, can't complain a whole lot. They've got nice people running it, too. Despite the

23:10.360 --> 23:14.200
fact we've gone to their awards ceremony two years in a row and didn't win crap, we had

23:14.200 --> 23:18.480
to pay. We had a pretty decent time. Betty's really nice, and she's like, you know, kind

23:18.480 --> 23:24.040
of... I won crap. Oh yeah, that's right. We won the remote control a couple years ago.

23:24.040 --> 23:29.680
And I won speakers by playing bingo. Did you actually get them? Yeah. Cool. I want to tell

23:29.680 --> 23:33.680
you about Humongoid Box, you remember? That's right, you actually got to take the speakers

23:33.680 --> 23:37.360
because you would come in from a long ways out of town, whereas the other folks had to

23:37.360 --> 23:38.360
have it shipped to them.

23:38.360 --> 23:42.540
And the speakers now hooked up to my PC, where they were probably on display at Gamestop

23:42.540 --> 23:44.280
on Fulton and Marconi.

23:44.280 --> 23:46.440
Right on, right on.

23:46.440 --> 23:55.360
So anyway, Live 65 pays the licensing for songs that we play.

23:55.360 --> 23:59.140
And although we've kind of had discussions on staff, whereas, you know, is the video

23:59.140 --> 24:02.740
game music really, it's kind of in a gray area, you know, I don't think we really need

24:02.740 --> 24:08.160
to pay licensing on it, we don't really know. We do play a lot of other music in our pre-show,

24:08.160 --> 24:14.700
on Tuesday night's show, on the cage match that is ASCAP, BMI, all that stuff, licensed,

24:14.700 --> 24:19.920
and so Life 365 pays our licensing fees for that. So we're all legit, we're legal. Believe

24:19.920 --> 24:23.420
it or not, despite the hoards of things that Loki talks about on this program, our show

24:23.420 --> 24:29.460
is 100% legal for you to listen to. If we leave Life 365, there is no other service

24:29.460 --> 24:33.940
on the internet that I have found yet that offers a licensing payment service, like Life

24:33.940 --> 24:39.300
365 does, for a decent fee. So that's kind of one reason we think we're kind of stuck.

24:39.300 --> 24:44.100
But we've talked about, you know, going to Renegade and maybe doing another stream in

24:44.100 --> 24:48.020
the future. It just depends how things play out with Life 365 the rest of this year. So

24:48.020 --> 24:52.980
we will see. So we've been listening to you guys. We've thought about the switch up too,

24:52.980 --> 24:59.260
but those are kind of the reasons why we hesitate a little bit. So anyway. And now there's a

24:59.260 --> 25:04.300
There's a whole lot of other suggestions there in the chat room, which is kind of cool.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.100
Let's go back to mods.

25:06.100 --> 25:07.100
What kind of mods?

25:07.100 --> 25:08.100
Oh, like MOD format?

25:08.100 --> 25:09.100
Yeah.

25:09.100 --> 25:12.540
Dude, there used to be some kickass stuff in MOD format.

25:12.540 --> 25:15.940
You can't stream that stuff, or...

25:15.940 --> 25:17.260
No.

25:17.260 --> 25:18.260
That's just like...

25:18.260 --> 25:19.260
No.

25:19.260 --> 25:21.260
It wouldn't work.

25:21.260 --> 25:25.460
Besides, mods are like acid.

25:25.460 --> 25:26.860
And no one likes acid.

25:26.860 --> 25:27.860
Alright.

25:27.860 --> 25:30.820
start tonight's show although we've been talking a little bit here with some

25:30.820 --> 25:33.500
housekeeping things let's do a little bit of how was your week how was your

25:33.500 --> 25:36.660
day and since we've been gone for a little while you can talk about the

25:36.660 --> 25:39.940
highlights of your past few weeks if you should so choose starting off with the

25:39.940 --> 25:46.520
one and only dark Sakura who is now a blushing bride congratulations that dot

25:46.520 --> 25:56.300
dot yeah I got married it was pretty cool yeah nothing's really different but

25:56.300 --> 26:04.220
But uh, I was really getting married and playing with the puppies, and I played 2DX the other

26:04.220 --> 26:05.220
day.

26:05.220 --> 26:06.220
You were there.

26:06.220 --> 26:07.220
I was there.

26:07.220 --> 26:08.220
You played 2DX too.

26:08.220 --> 26:09.220
I did.

26:09.220 --> 26:10.220
I played 2DX, what were we playing, 7th and 8th style?

26:10.220 --> 26:11.220
7th and 8th style.

26:11.220 --> 26:12.220
On your ginormous fucking TV.

26:12.220 --> 26:13.220
That you have in your living room.

26:13.220 --> 26:14.980
It's so big it's pixelated stuff.

26:14.980 --> 26:18.260
Yeah, it's so big that 2DX is pixelated on it.

26:18.260 --> 26:23.020
And like we were looking at it going, gosh the quality of this is kind of junky.

26:23.020 --> 26:27.240
But it's still 2DX in full arcade mode, widescreen on a 50-inch TV.

26:27.240 --> 26:28.540
It was hot.

26:28.540 --> 26:29.540
That was, like, cool.

26:29.540 --> 26:30.540
And those red couches.

26:30.540 --> 26:32.860
I enjoy playing 2DX on my 30-inch widescreen.

26:32.860 --> 26:34.900
50-inch was very nice.

26:34.900 --> 26:35.900
Yeah.

26:35.900 --> 26:41.140
And, you know, I played, you know, it's more been a little bit of this and that.

26:41.140 --> 26:45.060
I've just been really busy between getting married and going to school.

26:45.060 --> 26:47.860
Haven't had too much time for much else.

26:47.860 --> 26:51.060
And that, and I think I have sinus infection.

26:51.060 --> 26:52.060
What shitty timing?

26:52.060 --> 26:56.380
Oh yeah, seriously, especially since I'm, you know, busy all the time now.

26:56.380 --> 27:01.260
And it's going to get worse, because two more classes come up in October.

27:01.260 --> 27:04.940
And I'm going to be back to doing homework all the time.

27:04.940 --> 27:09.060
At least I can take my puppies to work.

27:09.060 --> 27:14.060
I go out on break and feed my puppies during my break at work.

27:14.060 --> 27:18.140
Addict. So, you know, so I don't want them to run away.

27:18.140 --> 27:21.420
I'm saving up for the, trying to get the

27:21.420 --> 27:26.760
well is it five million saved up so I can buy the house at the the Japanese

27:26.760 --> 27:30.120
style house and make it is just five thousand five thousand five millions a

27:30.120 --> 27:36.860
little hard to come by that game I will and then I'm halfway there very cool so

27:36.860 --> 27:47.420
yeah that's it well well yeah there's a what I'm doing a yeah I don't know if

27:47.420 --> 27:54.020
people were listening, we got a pretty decent tune in for it, but on the first, I did the

27:54.020 --> 27:58.380
premiere, not the first, what am I saying, the first, a few weeks ago I did the premiere

27:58.380 --> 28:03.460
for the Blood and Scent album on Pump Up the Volume, and that had a pretty good reaction.

28:03.460 --> 28:13.460
But I've been trying to do what I can to play some of that on my station, on my show.

28:13.460 --> 28:14.460
Very cool.

28:14.460 --> 28:15.460
Helping promote the indie labels.

28:15.460 --> 28:16.460
Yep.

28:16.460 --> 28:22.460
Because that's also part of what we do. We try to get the new and the neat out there.

28:22.460 --> 28:27.460
But I really haven't had too much free time otherwise.

28:27.460 --> 28:29.460
Working on it!

28:29.460 --> 28:31.460
Alright, well I hope you get some free time pretty soon.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.460
Oh, I also have been working on stuff for Shaft 2.

28:34.460 --> 28:37.460
Ah, the tournament. Sacramento hosts another fabulous tournament.

28:37.460 --> 28:42.460
Tentative date around November 17th when DDRXBox releases.

28:42.460 --> 28:46.460
Or for some of us on staff, Sacramento hosts another fucking tournament.

28:46.460 --> 28:52.460
Yeah, there's that, but we're working on a GameStop sponsorship right now.

28:52.460 --> 28:57.460
Very cool. And we might have sponsorship from the Big K too, right?

28:57.460 --> 29:04.460
So we'll see. So more details coming on that, so DER tournaments not dead yet because we're going to throw a hell of a party.

29:04.460 --> 29:09.460
Why? Because we're the ones planning it here at Orange Lounge Radio with some help from our buddies in Sacramento.

29:09.460 --> 29:11.460
And bowling.

29:11.460 --> 29:13.460
Is that the big thing this year?

29:13.460 --> 29:15.460
We're going to have a bowling tournament, too.

29:15.460 --> 29:17.460
The first shaft was DDR and fried Twinkies.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.460
This year will be DDR and bowling.

29:19.460 --> 29:21.460
There was actually SCAT way back when,

29:21.460 --> 29:25.460
which was Sacramento Cosplay and Tournament.

29:25.460 --> 29:27.460
Which we had a 4% cosplay contest.

29:27.460 --> 29:29.460
Yeah, 4 people dressed up.

29:29.460 --> 29:31.460
I liked Ryan's outfit.

29:31.460 --> 29:33.460
He was the Afro Nova dude.

29:33.460 --> 29:35.460
Yeah.

29:35.460 --> 29:43.900
And we got up there and did Afronova in costume, that was pretty rad.

29:43.900 --> 29:46.180
And then there was...

29:46.180 --> 29:48.780
Somebody was Devil Zukin, I remember that.

29:48.780 --> 29:49.780
Yeah.

29:49.780 --> 29:50.780
We had...

29:50.780 --> 29:53.240
That was actually one of our...

29:53.240 --> 29:55.740
One of the old games...

29:55.740 --> 29:59.420
Golf Land regulars.

29:59.420 --> 30:04.340
And then we had the Twinkie one.

30:04.340 --> 30:07.800
We had the BeatMania contest with it too.

30:07.800 --> 30:11.180
And this year it's going to be DDR and bowling.

30:11.180 --> 30:12.340
Very cool.

30:12.340 --> 30:15.540
You know right now there's a whole lot of In the Groove tournaments going on because

30:15.540 --> 30:19.780
they're doing like a national thing for In the Groove.

30:19.780 --> 30:22.460
I have to be honest, I haven't read up on it because I don't think they're doing one

30:22.460 --> 30:23.460
here in Sacramento.

30:23.460 --> 30:25.260
I think they're going to do one at Miggle for kind of like NorCal.

30:25.260 --> 30:31.100
From what I understand, there's actually been, it's officially by, what's the point called

30:31.100 --> 30:32.100
now?

30:32.100 --> 30:33.100
Paradise Island?

30:33.100 --> 30:34.100
Paradise Island.

30:34.100 --> 30:38.660
Did they have put a stop on any In the Groove tournaments until...?

30:38.660 --> 30:42.220
That's what we heard, something about Sacramento locally, and I wish Explicit was here because

30:42.220 --> 30:46.300
he'd know more of the details on what's going on because he works there at Paradise Island.

30:46.300 --> 30:50.180
Apparently what went on is that folks are using the old fishing wire trick where they

30:50.180 --> 30:54.180
put the fish... the... not that I'm telling you how to get free credits, don't do this

30:54.180 --> 30:57.860
or we'll come find you and beat you up... where you put the token on the fishing wire,

30:57.860 --> 30:59.980
you have like a hole in the token, you put the token on the fishing wire, and you can

30:59.980 --> 31:01.580
kind of drop it in and then pull it out.

31:01.580 --> 31:02.580
And then... no, no, no, no, no, no.

31:02.580 --> 31:03.580
It's even more than that.

31:03.580 --> 31:05.580
You put it in there and beat on it.

31:05.580 --> 31:07.580
And you get credit, credit, credit, credit, credit every time you beat on it.

31:07.580 --> 31:08.580
Gotcha.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.580
So yeah, don't do that at home, or at the arcade.

31:10.580 --> 31:13.580
Yeah, because when you do that, then the arcades don't make money off you.

31:13.580 --> 31:14.580
I do that at home.

31:14.580 --> 31:15.580
You aren't in the groove.

31:15.580 --> 31:17.580
Well, you can do that at home all you want.

31:17.580 --> 31:20.580
We don't want to know about what you beat off at home.

31:20.580 --> 31:21.580
Yeah.

31:21.580 --> 31:23.580
My cabinet, duh.

31:23.580 --> 31:24.580
Yeah.

31:24.580 --> 31:26.580
I gotta play Miss World Nude.

31:26.580 --> 31:28.580
Gotta, gotta, gotta.

31:28.580 --> 31:33.580
I have the luxury of being able to map the coin button to any of the buttons on the thing.

31:33.580 --> 31:41.580
We've got our coin thing hooked up on ours so we just, like, hit the player one button continuously because it's on freeplay.

31:41.580 --> 31:49.580
Anyway, so don't steal credits because then the arcade operators don't make money and then they decide to get rid of their DDR machines and then you wonder why DDR is dying.

31:49.580 --> 31:51.580
Oh, I did play something else.

31:51.580 --> 31:52.580
What?

31:52.580 --> 31:55.580
Arcade P.O.P.O. on the name.

31:55.580 --> 31:56.580
There you go.

31:56.580 --> 31:57.580
Yeah, I did play something else.

31:57.580 --> 32:01.580
How was your week? How was your day?

32:27.580 --> 32:34.580
to talk to other distributors and companies about their games, and he just didn't get a chance to send it yet.

32:34.580 --> 32:39.580
But soon, he promised me he'll send it, so I have to wait for that.

32:39.580 --> 32:48.580
And then the Tomo guy, they're the company that's behind the H-Tech products, so they're just going to send me some stuff, hopefully.

32:48.580 --> 32:54.580
And we just, you know, EA, Microsoft, Ubisoft, just everybody.

32:54.580 --> 32:58.200
all their lineup and everything it's fucking awesome and got to find out about

32:58.200 --> 33:04.440
the Xbox 360 and all that fun stuff so anyways we did that I got lots of free

33:04.440 --> 33:10.680
games which I then sold to GameStop to put towards my 360 so I now have $250

33:10.680 --> 33:20.120
towards my 360 and then also what else oh well let's see yesterday relatives

33:20.120 --> 33:28.600
came up and hung out with them and they barbecued for me and today I got lunch and I've been

33:28.600 --> 33:35.280
just playing mainly a lot of Burnout 3 and then I got a, I found an ISO for Burnout Legends

33:35.280 --> 33:39.600
so I've been playing that on my PSP because it's awesome. Just the kill time until I get

33:39.600 --> 33:45.760
Burnout Revenge which is coming out next Wednesday and yeah, I can't wait for that. I already

33:45.760 --> 33:50.440
I have it paid for, it's reserved, I just have to go pick it up.

33:50.440 --> 33:52.080
Lots of fun stuff.

33:52.080 --> 33:54.200
And yeah, that's pretty much it.

33:54.200 --> 33:55.200
Alright.

33:55.200 --> 34:00.560
Neil, would you care to share with us how your week and your day has been?

34:00.560 --> 34:04.240
Well, remember we saw the Strangest Thing at Fry's yesterday, looking through the DS

34:04.240 --> 34:05.240
games?

34:05.240 --> 34:09.160
Yeah, what the hell, Fry's is carrying import DS games now?

34:09.160 --> 34:10.160
Might just be the Bay Area.

34:10.160 --> 34:13.280
But yeah, well, I think probably just that one.

34:13.280 --> 34:17.280
Very interesting, but they're not carrying anything super special.

34:17.280 --> 34:23.280
They had an import pool game, like billiards pool, and an import mahjong game.

34:23.280 --> 34:24.280
That's it.

34:24.280 --> 34:26.280
That's all we saw, at least.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.280
At least that's all we found.

34:27.280 --> 34:30.280
But no import copies in Nintendogs or games happening out here yet?

34:30.280 --> 34:33.280
Yeah, because like the Game Boy Advance, there's no region coding on them.

34:33.280 --> 34:40.280
Which is interesting that a major retailer such as Fry's, which I know is only on the west coast mostly, but...

34:40.280 --> 34:42.280
They're sneaking out to the east.

34:42.280 --> 34:45.840
Are they now? They're in Georgia, in Illinois, and Indiana now.

34:45.840 --> 34:52.180
Well, Outpost.com, too, is the national site for fries, so they're carrying at least that

34:52.180 --> 34:56.360
one store, some import DS games. Fremont, for those in the Bay Area.

34:56.360 --> 35:02.900
What have I been playing? I've been playing, well, guess what, Burnout 3! And, yes, I'm

35:02.900 --> 35:09.880
also looking forward to Burnout 4. I guess I'm going to go sell back FlatOut and put

35:09.880 --> 35:20.040
that down on it, because I did not like FlatOut. Compared to Burnout, it sucked.

35:20.040 --> 35:23.760
Diablo II, and I've been playing drinking games.

35:23.760 --> 35:26.440
Is Diablo II still really popular on the internet?

35:26.440 --> 35:29.720
Apparently so. The servers are still pretty damn full.

35:29.720 --> 35:32.320
Diablo II is like ten years old.

35:32.320 --> 35:34.320
It came out in 2000.

35:34.320 --> 35:37.120
2005 years old. That's still a long life for a computer game.

35:37.120 --> 35:38.800
They just put out a patch for it last month.

35:38.800 --> 35:42.560
Wow. It's up to 1.11. Are the people still playing it?

35:42.560 --> 35:47.200
I played Diablo 2 for like a month and I just, I suck at it.

35:47.200 --> 35:51.320
I just keep making more characters. I'm coming up, trying to come up with more creative names

35:51.320 --> 35:52.560
like Itchy Scratchy,

35:52.560 --> 35:56.000
Bernie, and other

35:56.000 --> 35:59.080
nicely descriptive ones. Deadly,

35:59.080 --> 36:03.020
stuff like that. And as for the drinking game, it's been going around all the

36:03.020 --> 36:03.960
breweries and picking,

36:03.960 --> 36:07.000
getting a full sampler and seeing which of their beers really suck,

36:07.000 --> 36:12.680
And making sliding him back and forth until somebody says I'll fuck it and just drinks it best brewery. You've been to

36:13.720 --> 36:18.980
Said work by far said works said work. No s just said work said work

36:19.000 --> 36:24.120
Is that now is that just because it's the local one near you that's because it's the one I can stumble to yeah

36:24.960 --> 36:29.220
All I have to do is be able to stumble back across train tracks, and I'm sad all right

36:29.720 --> 36:35.080
But other than that Gordon Bierch down in down in the Bay Area and Pyramid Brewery, which is kind of a national

36:35.080 --> 36:40.080
But this week I went to BJ's, which is kind of a pizza and a brewery place.

36:40.080 --> 36:41.080
Isn't that like a chain of restaurants?

36:41.080 --> 36:42.080
It's a chain.

36:42.080 --> 36:43.080
It's a national chain.

36:43.080 --> 36:45.080
They just built one.

36:45.080 --> 36:47.080
They've built two here in Northern California now, I think.

36:47.080 --> 36:49.080
The one in San Jose does not have a brewery.

36:49.080 --> 36:50.080
Okay.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.080
There's one in Folsom.

36:51.080 --> 36:52.080
Is there now?

36:52.080 --> 36:53.080
Yeah.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.080
They just built one up there.

36:54.080 --> 36:55.080
Oh, it wasn't on their website.

36:55.080 --> 36:56.080
And there's one in Roseville.

36:56.080 --> 36:57.080
Yeah, I went to the one in Roseville.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.080
Okay.

36:58.080 --> 37:01.080
And then I went out to Lincoln to Beerman's and it was all bad.

37:01.080 --> 37:03.080
It didn't have enough taste to be real beer.

37:03.080 --> 37:04.080
Gotcha.

37:04.080 --> 37:06.080
It's pretty bad. I'm turning into a beer connoisseur.

37:06.080 --> 37:09.080
Now, last night was beer night.

37:09.080 --> 37:12.080
Oh yeah, I did forget to mention that.

37:12.080 --> 37:17.080
Last night was our friend wedding reception at Dave & Buster's.

37:17.080 --> 37:19.080
So I did actually play more games last night.

37:19.080 --> 37:21.080
Where I went through 50 ounces of beer in 10 minutes.

37:21.080 --> 37:25.080
I went through 50 ounces of beer in several segments.

37:25.080 --> 37:28.080
I had Guinness in a blackened van.

37:28.080 --> 37:29.080
And so I bought that blackened van.

37:29.080 --> 37:31.080
And played BattleTech.

37:31.080 --> 37:38.960
You know what I found? The 8-player Daytona USA? They don't have drink holders, you can't

37:38.960 --> 37:39.960
drink and drive.

37:39.960 --> 37:40.960
Damn it.

37:40.960 --> 37:44.320
It sucks. Most of the other driving games do have cup holders, so you can put down your

37:44.320 --> 37:45.320
giant beer and drive.

37:45.320 --> 37:50.360
You want to know what's sad about that Daytona set-up, though? I played the first one when

37:50.360 --> 37:57.240
it was completely brand new, debuted in Vegas when I was in 11th grade, which was in 90-

37:57.240 --> 37:58.240
A while ago.

37:58.240 --> 38:05.240
Two. Wow. I know. No, you couldn't have been in 11th grade in 92.

38:05.240 --> 38:08.240
I graduated in 94. Holy crap. You're older than us.

38:08.240 --> 38:15.240
Well, I'm 29. I graduated junior high in 92, but I guess that makes sense, because I would have started in 9th grade in 92.

38:15.240 --> 38:21.240
Hey, amazingly enough, I did too. Just for those who don't know, I've known Bugs since, like, 7th grade.

38:21.240 --> 38:24.240
I almost said 4th grade, I don't know why. 7th grade.

38:24.240 --> 38:29.480
into somebody at Dave & Buster's last night that I met in fifth grade, and he recognized

38:29.480 --> 38:30.480
me.

38:30.480 --> 38:32.640
Yeah, how do you recognize somebody from the fifth grade?

38:32.640 --> 38:35.200
Because I shaved.

38:35.200 --> 38:40.920
I usually am fully inflamed in beard, and happened to shave yesterday.

38:40.920 --> 38:41.920
I don't look that different.

38:41.920 --> 38:45.480
We went through the yearbooks at the birthday party last month, and I don't look that different.

38:45.480 --> 38:47.920
At least I never looked like a dork.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.760
I have a friend of mine who I just talked to last night.

38:49.760 --> 38:53.600
Well, finish your guys' story, then I'll do my side note.

38:53.600 --> 38:55.560
We were looking at your picture and laughing.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.060
Shut up.

38:57.060 --> 38:58.060
We need to scan that.

38:58.060 --> 39:02.820
I'm sorry for interjecting again, but the other game I played was, uh, Midnight, uh,

39:02.820 --> 39:05.960
was a Lincoln Midnight, um, Maximum Tune.

39:05.960 --> 39:07.080
And I kicked Han's ass.

39:07.080 --> 39:08.080
It was great.

39:08.080 --> 39:11.400
Isn't he a really big Initial D fan, too?

39:11.400 --> 39:12.400
Yeah.

39:12.400 --> 39:13.400
That's quite an accomplishment.

39:13.400 --> 39:20.620
He picked an EVO-8 with the MR, with the sixth speed transmission, and I did the MR in automatic

39:20.620 --> 39:23.400
just because I hate having to deal with it, and I still won.

39:23.400 --> 39:24.400
Okay, I'm done.

39:24.400 --> 39:25.400
Sorry.

39:25.400 --> 39:31.320
Uh, I had 6,667 coupons on my card last night at one point.

39:31.320 --> 39:32.320
Jeez.

39:32.320 --> 39:35.200
I only got 1,900.

39:35.200 --> 39:38.200
I've bought very few things from the little Dave & Buster's redemption store.

39:38.200 --> 39:40.040
And I still haven't gone through those pixie sticks.

39:40.040 --> 39:43.860
For those of you guys who have never been to Dave & Buster's before, it's like Chuck-E-Cheese

39:43.860 --> 39:47.160
or like an arcade with pizza type thing.

39:47.160 --> 39:49.680
Chuck-E-Cheese and arcade, pizza, and a bar.

39:49.680 --> 39:51.260
Yeah, but for adults.

39:51.260 --> 39:53.080
And they kick kids out at some point, right?

39:53.080 --> 39:55.280
Like after 10 o'clock, don't they get...

39:55.280 --> 39:58.200
At any time, they have to be accompanied by an adult.

39:58.200 --> 39:59.920
And they usually aren't, which...

39:59.920 --> 40:03.080
Although oftentimes they are, that's why you're not tripping over kids all the time.

40:03.080 --> 40:06.920
Yeah, which is nice, because you don't have little kids running around screaming so much,

40:06.920 --> 40:09.400
and little kids in there thinking they own the place and stuff, because their parents

40:09.400 --> 40:10.400
have to be with them.

40:10.400 --> 40:14.140
Well, just think little kids plus big drunken people don't really mix well, because big

40:14.140 --> 40:15.680
drunken people can punt little kids.

40:15.680 --> 40:21.160
But it's so nice that you can be there and game with other adults.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.260
And although it's kind of cheesy because half their games are ticket games, just like a

40:24.260 --> 40:26.380
normal arcade, but they're so much fun.

40:26.380 --> 40:29.240
Like they have, they had a pachinko type one, but they got rid of that.

40:29.240 --> 40:32.080
And they got rid of the other one because it broke to the point they couldn't fix it.

40:32.080 --> 40:34.280
Yeah, the, the golden temple one.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.640
The one where you push all the money off, however.

40:36.640 --> 40:38.760
Did they have the flaming finger still?

40:38.760 --> 40:39.760
Yes, flaming finger still.

40:39.760 --> 40:43.880
I want flaming finger jackpot, first try.

40:43.880 --> 40:47.220
Flaming finger is this game that you control with your finger on like this giant touch

40:47.220 --> 40:48.220
board.

40:48.220 --> 40:49.220
The countdown speeds up the further you get up there.

40:49.220 --> 40:50.220
Yeah, it does, it does.

40:50.220 --> 40:53.900
You have to move your finger through the maze as fast as you can to win the jackpot.

40:53.900 --> 40:54.900
Made by Namco.

40:54.900 --> 40:55.900
Yeah, made by Namco.

40:55.900 --> 40:58.840
And as a- like, uh, we were- Mikolatov was there yesterday and I was kinda hanging out

40:58.840 --> 41:03.100
with him most of the day, and, um, he- he would say, no, don't play it, just let's listen

41:03.100 --> 41:04.100
to the music.

41:04.100 --> 41:06.100
Cause he likes the music.

41:06.100 --> 41:10.020
Cause it does a pooch, like a little techno music when you're moving your finger through

41:10.020 --> 41:11.020
it.

41:11.020 --> 41:13.780
Also, Mikolatov made me play tons of Pump It Up yesterday.

41:13.780 --> 41:18.140
That's like every time I was looking for Rob, it was like either by the bar or by Pump It

41:18.140 --> 41:19.140
Up.

41:19.140 --> 41:20.140
It doesn't make it any better.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.140
No, it's cool.

41:21.140 --> 41:23.140
I'm actually starting to like Pump It Up.

41:23.140 --> 41:26.140
Damn him for making me like Pump It Up.

41:26.140 --> 41:30.140
But between the home release, which I'll talk about after the break, the home release and

41:30.140 --> 41:35.140
this recent arcade release, as much as I still hate Pump's interface, I'm really starting

41:35.140 --> 41:38.140
to like Pump a lot more, which is kind of scary.

41:38.140 --> 41:39.140
Are you really Rob?

41:39.140 --> 41:40.140
I know.

41:40.140 --> 41:41.140
I don't know what happened.

41:41.140 --> 41:43.140
I think it's a pod, Rob.

41:43.140 --> 41:46.140
Rob did show me earlier, though, and I'm not sure.

41:46.140 --> 41:51.940
Rob did show me earlier, though, another reason why In the Groove sucks, and I thank him for

41:51.940 --> 41:52.940
that.

41:52.940 --> 41:58.700
All right, we were playing, Loki brought over some games tonight, or should I say, he just

41:58.700 --> 42:01.400
brought over his PS2 hard drive, which is loaded with games.

42:01.400 --> 42:03.460
And I'm looking at his list of games.

42:03.460 --> 42:06.460
And you know how when you load a game onto the HD loader, for those of you guys who have

42:06.460 --> 42:09.020
seen it, you can write in whatever the game is called.

42:09.020 --> 42:15.080
Well, he wrote in, In the Groove, parentheses, this game sucks, because you know kids that

42:15.080 --> 42:19.220
Loki does not like In The Groove and he makes no apologies about hating this game.

42:19.220 --> 42:22.300
So I said, well I want to look at this, I want to see how the home version turned out.

42:22.300 --> 42:26.900
Granted, I got to go to their premiere party in San Francisco months ago thanks to DR Freak,

42:26.900 --> 42:31.600
but you couldn't hear the songs there and it was still, I don't think it was a finished

42:31.600 --> 42:32.600
version.

42:32.600 --> 42:35.600
So I wanted to see how it really looked like on my TV, on my setup.

42:35.600 --> 42:39.520
So we checked out In The Groove and I said, Loki, did you hear about that they had censored

42:39.520 --> 42:42.240
all these songs in In The Groove?

42:42.240 --> 42:44.260
And Loki said, what?

42:44.260 --> 42:49.820
So we played Torn, and that's the one that goes, you know, I'm cold and I am shamed,

42:49.820 --> 42:51.380
lying naked on the floor.

42:51.380 --> 42:57.220
That's how the lyrics go, but they did, I'm cold and I am shamed, lying on the floor.

42:57.220 --> 42:59.980
What is bad about the word naked?

42:59.980 --> 43:03.920
They censored the word naked, no, but this is the one that got me, is that there's one

43:03.920 --> 43:10.100
in, we were playing Mouth, and I swear to God, the lyrics go, when I kiss your salty

43:10.100 --> 43:16.660
The game went, when I kiss your lips, and I was like, what the hell is wrong with the

43:16.660 --> 43:17.740
word salty?

43:17.740 --> 43:21.620
Although I could be wrong, like maybe the word was sexy lips or something and I'm just

43:21.620 --> 43:24.580
wrong in what I remember of hearing, but I'm like, what the hell is wrong with the word

43:24.580 --> 43:25.580
salty?

43:25.580 --> 43:29.700
This is why censorship is bad.

43:29.700 --> 43:34.620
In the Groove is on a low sodium diet apparently, so I am now calling the In the Groove PS2

43:34.620 --> 43:35.620
version.

43:35.620 --> 43:40.900
the In the Groove Mormon edition.

43:40.900 --> 43:45.540
You remember when Titanic first came out on VHS, these Mormon families were taking their

43:45.540 --> 43:50.260
tapes in to be edited so that they could cut out Kate Winslet's boobies out of the movie

43:50.260 --> 43:55.820
and the scene where the hand gets slammed because they're having sex and all that.

43:55.820 --> 43:59.260
They actually would physically cut up the tape and it was a really bad editing job so

43:59.260 --> 44:02.780
they could show this movie to their kids because Titanic was a historically important movie

44:02.780 --> 44:03.780
or whatever.

44:03.780 --> 44:10.780
But they cut out the boobies. That's just, that's exactly what they're doing in this game. They're cutting out the salt.

44:10.780 --> 44:13.780
And I can imagine the lowkey that would be just the boobies.

44:13.780 --> 44:25.780
The first time I saw that movie was off of a pirated copy from the Oscars that they gave the Oscars panel to watch, which is how I had it on VHS about six months early.

44:25.780 --> 44:34.780
The first time I saw that movie was on HBO, and it was such a bad movie, we couldn't get up to turn it off because we had no will to live anymore.

44:34.780 --> 44:38.780
And so we decided that we were like, somebody get up and stop it, please.

44:38.780 --> 44:40.780
The ending's pretty cool, with the boat.

44:40.780 --> 44:48.780
Yeah, the only reason I like this movie is because Leonardo DiCaprio died, and he died a horrible death.

44:48.780 --> 44:51.680
You know what, you can see his thumb break off.

44:51.680 --> 44:55.320
When she's letting go and he's falling into the water, his thumb is still attached to

44:55.320 --> 44:57.280
the piece of driftwood.

44:57.280 --> 44:58.280
Well that's cool.

44:58.280 --> 45:01.320
That was really cool.

45:01.320 --> 45:05.680
I still, as I said, I haven't seen it, and I already know how the movie's going to end,

45:05.680 --> 45:06.680
why would I want to see it?

45:06.680 --> 45:07.680
The boat fucking sinks!

45:07.680 --> 45:11.400
How can you make a three hour movie about something you already know of?

45:11.400 --> 45:15.000
Well, then there's like JFK, Nixon, uh...

45:15.000 --> 45:22.480
Decaprio dies, the boat sinks, the old lady had the jewel the whole time. There, I just

45:22.480 --> 45:26.800
saved you three hours of pain. You know, you can thank me via email.

45:26.800 --> 45:32.320
The ending of The Passion of the Christ totally came at me as a surprise. I did not expect

45:32.320 --> 45:33.320
that.

45:33.320 --> 45:35.960
You know, I really liked the book a lot better.

45:35.960 --> 45:41.640
Well, wasn't Passion of the Christ for the breakout in Song and Dance at the end, or

45:41.640 --> 45:43.360
am I thinking of a Mel Brooks movie again?

45:43.360 --> 45:44.360
I think you are.

45:44.360 --> 45:48.180
by the way i have a dilemma

45:48.180 --> 45:49.360
jesus christ

45:49.360 --> 45:50.600
november

45:50.600 --> 45:54.000
yes depeche mode concert or bill ingvall

45:54.000 --> 45:55.140
depeche mode

45:55.140 --> 45:56.040
all the way

45:56.040 --> 45:57.140
all the way

45:57.140 --> 46:01.080
i'm still debating cuz i don't like concerts bill ingvall is

46:01.080 --> 46:03.080
not that funny to me

46:03.080 --> 46:07.360
then again where am i from? Alabama so they actually watch blue-collar

46:07.360 --> 46:10.480
comedy tour whatever down there i guess but

46:10.480 --> 46:12.440
not in my house

46:12.440 --> 46:15.740
Bill Engvall is funny funny. Have you listened to any of his stuff all the way through?

46:15.740 --> 46:18.540
I actually had to watch one of the episodes of that show once.

46:18.540 --> 46:19.040
Okay.

46:19.040 --> 46:20.440
They all do a little stand-up in it.

46:20.440 --> 46:25.240
I'm gonna bring over my friend, Julie's DVD, and you're gonna watch it with me.

46:26.840 --> 46:27.740
That's even better.

46:28.040 --> 46:30.440
It's Steven Lynch is releasing a new album.

46:30.940 --> 46:31.740
Isn't he dead?

46:32.040 --> 46:34.040
No, that's Mitch Hedberg that's dead.

46:34.040 --> 46:34.540
What?

46:35.140 --> 46:37.340
How do I get those two confused?

46:37.440 --> 46:39.240
No, Steven Lynch is much alive.

46:39.240 --> 46:43.240
Mitch Hedberg was the one that was doing crack or whatever.

46:43.240 --> 46:46.240
I just assume all the funny comics are dead, honestly.

46:46.240 --> 46:47.240
Comics aren't funny until they die.

46:47.240 --> 46:49.240
Why couldn't he live to release another CD?

46:49.240 --> 46:54.240
I mean, honestly, I loved his work and he had to go and die after the second CD.

46:54.240 --> 46:59.240
That is such a cop-out. That's like something Gravity Kills would do.

46:59.240 --> 47:03.240
Or Echo Image.

47:03.240 --> 47:08.240
Or come back, we're under a new label, we're really working on that album that'll never ever come out.

47:33.240 --> 47:40.720
weeks worth of email, but you know, I'll live. And I played a lot of Final Fantasy XI while

47:40.720 --> 47:46.320
I was here. Loki, everybody got their Promivians done yesterday.

47:46.320 --> 47:50.720
Son of a bitch! The mic's not on.

47:50.720 --> 47:55.480
Fucking asshole! Son of a bitch! Okay, listen. Why the hell does everybody... Okay, how much

47:55.480 --> 47:58.760
you want of it? Does everyone have their AF done? Because they sure as hell won't help

47:58.760 --> 48:01.480
me with mine. No, I don't. I'm only level 53. I don't have

48:01.480 --> 48:08.000
I only have like, I have the boots which are completely useless for a black mage and I

48:08.000 --> 48:09.840
don't have any of my permivians done.

48:09.840 --> 48:14.760
I don't even know why I have the chains of permothia or whatever it is, because I can't,

48:14.760 --> 48:17.860
I don't go to any of those places.

48:17.860 --> 48:19.400
We're all experts at those permivians now.

48:19.400 --> 48:21.040
We can run you through them like this.

48:21.040 --> 48:25.840
I need, I've been trying to get back in and play, it's just I have too many things I've

48:25.840 --> 48:27.120
tried to do at the same time.

48:27.120 --> 48:30.760
It's for the best, honestly, because I probably won't be playing much Final Fantasy 11 after

48:30.760 --> 48:36.920
this week. I won't have time. Oh, I don't have time, but I'm buying World of Warcraft.

48:36.920 --> 48:42.480
Well, at least one of us needs to be reporting on that game, so, fine. Because World of Warcraft

48:42.480 --> 48:46.560
is a really big and popular game, and none of us are playing it, so. Well, at least they

48:46.560 --> 48:50.880
actually have some really cool system or game that's within the game, you know, sort of

48:50.880 --> 48:59.640
like a capture the flag type thing, but we have ballista. Woo, ballista! That was crap.

48:59.640 --> 49:04.180
splits ball that's true I will take the blitz but I'll take the ballista minigame

49:04.180 --> 49:09.620
over that fucking card game in eight yeah thank God Tetra master isn't in the

49:09.620 --> 49:12.940
game oh no Tetra master was nine it was a different card game in eight it was

49:12.940 --> 49:15.620
pretty much the same thing though wasn't it I never touched the card game the

49:15.620 --> 49:20.700
card game can suck my balls I hated the card I never played it it's but you feel

49:20.700 --> 49:24.720
like you have to or you're gonna miss out on items um I didn't feel like I had

49:24.720 --> 49:27.840
to I didn't care about this you know that I just how I played again I got

49:27.840 --> 49:32.840
I went halfway through the third disc before I was like, screw it, I'll let somebody else beat the game and I never touch it again.

49:36.840 --> 49:43.840
You know what game I also got done playing a lot of? I was playing a lot of.hack because I actually went and picked up that game because I played it once, like a year and a half ago.

49:43.840 --> 49:47.840
And I was always like, I want to get that game, I want to get that game. So I finally got it because it's like 20 bucks somewhere.

49:47.840 --> 49:48.840
By the way, Jamie.

49:48.840 --> 49:49.840
It's neat, I like it.

49:49.840 --> 49:54.840
They leaked Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Japanese DVD copy onto the internet.

49:54.840 --> 49:58.960
was just about to get into that. I know. I was just about to get into that. Haven't downloaded

49:58.960 --> 50:04.040
it though. First off, it's today is September 11th, so you know what that means. It's Loki's

50:04.040 --> 50:11.200
birthday today. Happy birthday, Loki. Yay. So how old are you now? 25. 25. Oh, a quarter

50:11.200 --> 50:14.960
century old. Now how did you celebrate your birthday today? I went to Olive Garden and

50:14.960 --> 50:20.520
had lunch, and that was it. Yummy. Well, since I was too cheap to get you a present today,

50:20.520 --> 50:24.440
I decided to leak Final Fantasy VII Advent Children on the internet for you.

50:24.440 --> 50:26.440
So enjoy, because I know you really wanted that.

50:26.440 --> 50:27.440
So check it out.

50:27.440 --> 50:29.640
Yeah, there's been a lot of people doing the same type of thing for me.

50:29.640 --> 50:33.200
Like, for example, somebody leaked Burnout Legends on the internet, so I got to play

50:33.200 --> 50:36.960
that and, you know, Advent Children on the internet, and what else was there that they

50:36.960 --> 50:38.760
leaked on the internet that I downloaded?

50:38.760 --> 50:42.320
Uh, that's some other stuff, I'm sure.

50:42.320 --> 50:43.480
Burnout Legends was me.

50:43.480 --> 50:45.040
Oh, well, thank you.

50:45.040 --> 50:47.280
I appreciate it.

50:47.280 --> 50:53.380
And yeah, I know there was one other thing that they did.

50:53.380 --> 50:58.480
You know a DS game that everybody has been just going off about and just loving and adoring?

50:58.480 --> 51:02.340
I need to pick this up because everybody is just wanting to make sweet love to this game

51:02.340 --> 51:04.720
and they're doing it in the chatroom right now.

51:04.720 --> 51:05.720
Advance Wars DS.

51:05.720 --> 51:11.160
I've heard lots of great things about this game, but I need to pick it up at some point.

51:11.160 --> 51:12.160
They have a site.

51:12.160 --> 51:15.120
You can make paper Advance Wars characters.

51:15.120 --> 51:16.520
That's cheesy, but cute.

51:16.520 --> 51:20.040
Nintendo it's a very Nintendo thing to do well Nintendo didn't do it some guy

51:20.040 --> 51:24.360
did no that's even worse or whatever where can they download this wasn't it

51:24.360 --> 51:29.960
on dig calm yeah dig a link to it dig dig.com yeah how's the link to the

51:29.960 --> 51:33.860
it's like slash dot but they you know they pat themselves on the back way too

51:33.860 --> 51:42.920
much no and the stuff is sort of relevant and they're usually the dupes

51:42.920 --> 51:49.920
groups get, you know, put together. You don't have to wait days for them.

51:50.880 --> 51:53.000
Let's all profess our love for Slashdot.

51:53.000 --> 51:58.560
I like Slashdot. It's a good sign. Anyway, uh, there's low energy in here tonight.

51:58.560 --> 51:59.440
I don't know what it is.

51:59.440 --> 52:03.600
No, we need diverse systems. More diverse systems.

52:03.600 --> 52:06.760
We will do a diverse systems break later than you, I promise you. But I had to do this,

52:06.760 --> 52:11.360
this break. First I had a request for No Doubt Get Loud because of the new iTunes commercial,

52:11.360 --> 52:14.620
So they said I should play that song, but we'll get to that song in this break

52:14.620 --> 52:19.300
However, there's a song that's more important that I have to get to in this break and it's for Jamie, of course

52:19.840 --> 52:25.120
And we'll be back after this break with more Orange Launch Radio and and your calls coming up pretty soon in the show

52:25.120 --> 52:26.240

Bamani, actual Bamani titles. So we'll be back after this. Jamie, this one's for you.

54:06.480 --> 54:29.560

So give me your lady

57:03.160 --> 57:05.160
A stone in the middle of the dark

57:07.160 --> 57:09.160
Love

57:09.160 --> 57:10.160
Praying for love

57:23.160 --> 57:25.460
Simply being in love

57:26.780 --> 57:28.580
It's more than enough

57:30.460 --> 57:32.460
Simply being in love

57:33.880 --> 57:35.880
Simply being in love

57:41.000 --> 57:43.160
Simply being in love

57:48.220 --> 57:50.220
Simply being in love

57:50.220 --> 57:57.220
It's more than enough, simply be loved

57:57.220 --> 58:04.220
It's more than enough, simply be loved

58:04.220 --> 58:09.220
It's more than enough, yeah

58:09.220 --> 58:19.220
What are you trying to rid you of anything?

58:19.220 --> 58:22.220
You're just a ghost and it seems

58:22.220 --> 58:25.220
Just as you're leaving we're hiding

58:25.220 --> 58:26.220
Are you a boss?

58:26.220 --> 58:27.220
Are you somebody?

58:27.220 --> 58:30.220
Are you leaving anything?

58:30.220 --> 58:32.220
Are you a family?

58:32.220 --> 58:33.220
Don't know

58:33.220 --> 58:36.220
I'm just a man who's gonna leave this place

58:36.220 --> 58:43.220
One day I'll be alive

58:49.220 --> 58:52.220
You don't have to believe in a heart of a tale

58:52.220 --> 58:54.220
But it's all solid by your feet

58:54.220 --> 58:57.220
Still wanted to lose on you at first

58:57.220 --> 59:00.220
But it's getting older

59:30.220 --> 59:32.220
Don't you say anything

59:32.220 --> 59:34.220
Look in the mirror

59:34.220 --> 59:36.220
Hiding away the past

59:36.220 --> 59:38.220
You are my love

59:38.220 --> 59:40.220
I believe in anything

59:40.220 --> 59:42.220
You say I'm free

59:42.220 --> 59:43.220
Come on

59:43.220 --> 59:44.220
Come with me

59:44.220 --> 59:46.220
Don't leave me there

59:46.220 --> 59:48.220
Come on

59:48.220 --> 59:50.220
Come on

59:50.220 --> 59:52.220
Come on

59:52.220 --> 59:54.220
Come on

59:54.220 --> 01:00:17.220
We're going to do an extra song this break, this one's a special dedication.

01:00:17.220 --> 01:00:29.220
The End

01:00:29.220 --> 01:00:35.220
The End

01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:40.880
The

01:00:40.880 --> 01:00:48.880
It would be a much better sight with you with me

01:00:48.880 --> 01:00:55.880
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby

01:00:55.880 --> 01:01:00.880
Never felt so lonely then you came along

01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:07.880
So now what should I do? I'm strung out, addicted to you

01:01:07.880 --> 01:01:15.880
My body ached, now that you've gone My supply fell through

01:01:15.880 --> 01:01:20.880
And they gave me everything you had and more

01:01:20.880 --> 01:01:26.880
You craved my happiness When you made me feel a toy and made you smile

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:34.880
But now I feel your stress Love was never meant to be such a crazy affair, no

01:01:34.880 --> 01:01:36.880
And who has time but you?

01:01:36.880 --> 01:01:42.880
Never thought I'd sit around and ramble your love

01:01:42.880 --> 01:02:09.120
Thank you guys so much for tuning in and joining us tonight.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:11.360
I notice we have a lot more listeners than we usually do tonight.

01:02:11.360 --> 01:02:13.680
don't know what the heck's going on if we just are getting more people because

01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:16.720
of our podcast or if because I actually talked about it in the live journal

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:19.640
community or people are just going through withdrawals because we weren't

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:22.920
here for two weeks or just a combination of all the above which I'm thinking is

01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:27.500
partly that but regardless thanks for tuning in and wasting your Sunday night

01:02:27.500 --> 01:02:33.500
with us we appreciate it and we're just here talking about what's on our mind

01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:38.480
pop culture things DDR baumannii related things as they come up and what have you

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:47.040
I want to talk about Nintendo. Nintendo pisses me off. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a total

01:02:47.040 --> 01:02:52.220
Nintendo fanboy, but ever since I bought a widescreen TV, I've come to loathe Nintendo

01:02:52.220 --> 01:02:56.840
for their lack of support for widescreen and HD formats. You may have heard that story

01:02:56.840 --> 01:03:00.680
a while back where Nintendo said that they're not going to be supporting HDTV with their

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:07.480
revolution. Well, that's, I don't know why they're doing that in my opinion. Especially

01:03:07.480 --> 01:03:11.820
as HDTVs become more and more the standard. I realize right now not a lot of people have

01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:17.960
HDTVs, but if you go shopping for a new TV, they're starting to get priced pretty competitively.

01:03:17.960 --> 01:03:23.480
You know, the TV I picked up was $600, which granted is quite a bit of money, but not that

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:28.040
much more money than what you'd pay for a normal TV of the same size, probably about

01:03:28.040 --> 01:03:33.000
$200 more. So I think as the technology, you know, gets older and older and we start getting

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:37.200
into Christmas, I think HDTVs are really going to start taking over. And Nintendo has this

01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.040
absolute lack of support for

01:03:41.040 --> 01:03:46.800
HDTVs and widescreen. And I kind of realized that as I was trying to find a

01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:49.920
component cable for my Nintendo GameCube because as you know

01:03:49.920 --> 01:03:54.360
Loki got me a copy of Hello Kitty Roller Rescue a while back

01:03:54.360 --> 01:03:58.080
and Dark Sakura actually bought me Super Smash Brothers Melee for my

01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.800
birthday

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.760
except due to various reasons I just got it this week but that's alright.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:09.200
So I wanted to check that out and play it and I didn't really have cables, I only have

01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:11.920
the standard cables but no components to be found anywhere.

01:04:11.920 --> 01:04:17.520
So I'm looking on Nintendo's website, get this, they discontinued production of the

01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:21.600
component cables like years ago.

01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.600
Well maybe not that long ago, like a year ago or two years ago.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.280
They discontinued production of the component cables and get this, your GameCube has to

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:33.680
have a special port on the back that says digital in and out for you to even be able

01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:40.400
to use this component cable if you could find one. The new Gamecubes they made after mid-2004

01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:46.220
don't have this. They took a feature away from the new Gamecubes. They took this digital

01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:51.900
out port away. And their reason why? They said less than 1% of our users were using

01:04:51.900 --> 01:04:57.800
it. And I'm thinking, well okay, because the Gamecube is kind of the kiddie system, right?

01:04:57.800 --> 01:05:03.240
The Gamecube is the thing that the kid has in their bedroom so that they can play Pokemon

01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:09.120
or whatever, right? But the GameCube can also function as a pretty decent gaming system

01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:15.320
for the rest of us hardcore gamers, right? Like, for instance, Resident Evil 4, F-Zero,

01:05:15.320 --> 01:05:19.880
Smash Brothers Melee, although it's kind of, you know, kitty-like in its artwork, it's

01:05:19.880 --> 01:05:25.440
a great freaking game. It's one of my favorite games they put out on GameCube. No support

01:05:25.440 --> 01:05:32.480
for HD because they say less than 1% are using the HD feature as it is. I don't understand.

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.280
And how much was it just to put that little extra port on the back?

01:05:35.280 --> 01:05:38.700
I guess maybe this is one of the cost, maybe this is a way that they made the GameCube

01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:44.220
cost only $80 was by taking this future out, but that's cheap.

01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:49.440
You know that that cable that they do use, the S video and the regular video, that cable

01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:54.400
they do use is the same cable they've been using ever since the Super Nintendo.

01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:55.920
No, the Famicom had it.

01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:57.240
Did the Famicom have it too?

01:05:57.240 --> 01:05:58.420
Yeah, the Japanese.

01:05:58.420 --> 01:06:00.420
The regular...

01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.420
Bugs trying to say something about the Famicom had it, too.

01:06:02.420 --> 01:06:04.420
Yeah, the Japanese Famicom has it, too.

01:06:04.420 --> 01:06:08.420
Oh, I didn't realize that. See, now the Nintendo America just had red and yellow wires.

01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.420
Right, because that's all we had at the time. We didn't have any sort of connectors to really do it with.

01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:14.420
So that cable...

01:06:14.420 --> 01:06:19.420
Well, I guess that's kind of nice that you can take your Super Nintendo cable and use it on your Nintendo 64 and your GameCube.

01:06:19.420 --> 01:06:23.420
It hasn't changed in the last 15 years.

01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:27.420
So, I don't know. I'm a little disappointed at Nintendo's lack of support.

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.920
And some of the games on GameCube actually support widescreen TVs. I played F-Zero on widescreen.

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:41.420
It was sexy as hell, but blurry. Blurry because S-video is as high as it goes. Sadness.

01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:47.420
And, you know, it sucks too. It's really limiting themselves because they were only, you know, wanting to put out, you know,

01:06:47.420 --> 01:06:52.420
family games because this whole, you know, they didn't really want to touch on the whole, you know,

01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.220
curated games and stuff back when Mortal Kombat was out there. It's like, oh, we're just gonna

01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:00.060
pad out normal games, you know, and make this more kid-friendly system, because that's what

01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:05.740
people were looking for. And now they've kind of missed the bus. And now, you know, this

01:07:05.740 --> 01:07:10.820
whole, well, there's not gonna be, you know, that many broadband TVs and stuff. No one

01:07:10.820 --> 01:07:14.900
owns them right now. Well, yeah, but people are gonna be buying them, you know, in the

01:07:14.900 --> 01:07:16.780
future. So what are you gonna do with your game system then?

01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:20.580
I just, I'm having a hard time believing that they're, they're, they're, it seems like they're

01:07:20.580 --> 01:07:25.700
trying to put out a system that will support what the market wants right now, but no system

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:31.260
ever really takes off at launch, except for maybe, I don't know, Super Nintendo maybe

01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:37.260
did, but PlayStation even took a while to get big. Final Fantasy VII, I'm going to just

01:07:37.260 --> 01:07:40.900
say this, it might piss some people off, I think Final Fantasy VII is when the PlayStation

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:45.120
really started picking up. When Square announced that they were going to jump ship and go over

01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:48.340
and start making games for PlayStation, that's when the PlayStation really started selling

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:52.340
we saw a lot more games for it. That, in addition to things like Spyro, Crash Bandicoot.

01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:56.340
But I think that was really, like, the turning point.

01:07:56.340 --> 01:08:00.340
Even PlayStation 2, their launch titles weren't

01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:04.340
humongous. Fantavision?

01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:08.340
So no system ever really takes off in Fantavision. And Xbox launch?

01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:12.340
Don't make me laugh. And I think one of the only reasons

01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:16.340
PlayStation 2 had such a huge launch, which was probably one of the bigger ones in recent memory,

01:08:16.340 --> 01:08:18.980
which still wasn't, it's not like they were...

01:08:18.980 --> 01:08:22.140
I think it was riding on the success of the PlayStation.

01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.900
Well that, that, the fact that it would play the old PlayStation games, and that it was a DVD player.

01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:28.060
People were buying PlayStation 2s as DVD players.

01:08:28.060 --> 01:08:29.860
That was actually really true in Japan.

01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:34.940
But one thing about, though, the DVD player on the PS2 is that it's a piece of crap,

01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:38.140
and using it as your primary DVD player will shorten the life of the system.

01:08:38.140 --> 01:08:40.060
I don't believe that one bit. That is true.

01:08:40.060 --> 01:08:43.060
I used mine as my primary DVD player, never had a problem.

01:08:43.060 --> 01:08:45.340
You are in the minority then.

01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.840
I've heard of the problems, but I've yet to see it.

01:08:48.840 --> 01:08:55.340
Dan has told me that just about every return within the first few years of the PS2's release

01:08:55.340 --> 01:09:00.840
were for, basically, they were sliding off the track, it was everything related.

01:09:00.840 --> 01:09:05.840
Everyone who brought theirs back was because they were using it as a primary DVD player.

01:09:05.840 --> 01:09:09.340
I've used both my PlayStation 2 and my Xbox as DVD players.

01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.340
I'll tell you right now, the Xbox is a better DVD player, hands down.

01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.840
Oh yeah, because it's a more intelligently built system.

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.320
Better be if you got to pay $20 extra to use it.

01:09:17.320 --> 01:09:18.320
Yeah, that too.

01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.320
The fact, oh, that, oh.

01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:20.320
Microsoft could blow me for that.

01:09:20.320 --> 01:09:26.320
The Xbox itself, though, is a more intelligently constructed piece of equipment.

01:09:26.320 --> 01:09:27.320
In a way, in a way.

01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:37.080
It's made of better parts, it's a more stable system, you know, I bet if you drop a PS2

01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:41.200
and an Xbox, less of the Xbox will break.

01:09:41.200 --> 01:09:42.200
Maybe.

01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.560
I love, because it's so damn heavy.

01:09:44.560 --> 01:10:00.560
Microsoft is awesome because they're like, oh yeah, well this time around you don't have to pay extra to get your wonderful DVD remote. You can watch DVDs right out of the box. And everyone's like, oh yeah, but you've got to buy your hard drive.

01:10:00.560 --> 01:10:02.560
It's not connected to me in IRC.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:04.560
There's just too many people in IRC, it's me.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.560
It's not connected to Rojo.

01:10:12.560 --> 01:10:14.560
No route to host.

01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:30.000
Alright. Alright. Moving on. What was I going to talk about here? A little follow-up to

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:34.420
something we were talking about earlier in the program. Talking about those In the Groove

01:10:34.420 --> 01:10:39.120
tournaments that are going on around the nation. I said that Milpitas is going to be having

01:10:39.120 --> 01:10:43.840
one I think. Well, go figure. The person who's actually helping to put on this tournament

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:49.040
actually listening tonight and gave me a link to more information on the In The

01:10:49.040 --> 01:10:51.560
Groove tournament that's going to go on at Milpitas Golf Land. So for those of you

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:56.240
guys that happen to be in Northern California, September 24th 2005 is the

01:10:56.240 --> 01:11:00.840
date of the tournament, 11 a.m. for registration. Ten bucks will get you in

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:05.040
the tournaments. Ten dollars flat, there's no pre-reg fees, nothing. This is a

01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:09.800
straight-up perfect attack, expert only. You can find more complete rules over on

01:11:09.800 --> 01:11:14.520
DDR Freak and their tournament forums. But since it's in the Groove Expert tournament

01:11:14.520 --> 01:11:18.120
and I'm too old and too fat, yeah, I will not be entering this tournament. But I might

01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:25.600
go just have fun. Just to see people. But we'll see. So check that out. Loki, I will

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:36.440
not be attending this tournament. You wouldn't go just to socialize with people? No. Just

01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:43.160
curious the only thing I would want a boxer for in the first place is to have

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:49.040
a good system to run step mania on that's really all I wanted for food makes

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:53.040
food makes the arcade game much better use of the boxer than in the group

01:11:53.040 --> 01:11:58.960
anyway anyway you can find more information on a in the group tournament

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:03.720
happening near you on in the groove calm tell they're doing this big national

01:12:03.720 --> 01:12:10.720
Tell them, Red Octane, or not even Red Octane, Roxer. Get ahold of those guys in Japan, they're making good music.

01:12:10.720 --> 01:12:14.720
I'm telling you, you could put them together. Some good stuff there.

01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:19.720
I mean, at least it'll make the game a little bit better. But, you know, whatever.

01:12:22.720 --> 01:12:26.720
To each his own, if you want to play it, it's fine. I don't care.

01:12:26.720 --> 01:12:35.720
I can't believe there's people out there that played the Mad Cats one, so I mean, it's gotta be the MC Grooves dance craze.

01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:42.720
I know, it's horrible. You know what Mad Cats helped put out recently, though, that's actually pretty damn good? Pump It Up.

01:12:42.720 --> 01:12:49.720
Pump It Up Exceed, home version, kicks ass. I was very surprised, but it kicks a lot of ass.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:55.720
Despite the fact that I still hate the interface, I can't stand the way you go around and you pick your songs, it's better than it used to be.

01:12:55.720 --> 01:13:02.920
to be. It's about as good as that Pump It Up system is going to get, the home version.

01:13:02.920 --> 01:13:06.860
And there's a whole assload of songs in this game. They kind of split up the songs into

01:13:06.860 --> 01:13:11.840
three channels. You have your Banya channel, and Banya is kind of like the Naoki of Pump

01:13:11.840 --> 01:13:15.120
It Up. You know, it does a lot of these, just a variety of different types of songs.

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:19.200
So is it like 97 songs in the Banya channel and 4 in the other one?

01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:22.800
I know it's actually pretty evenly spaced out. I'll give it to them for that. It's about

01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:27.800
30 songs a piece. You've got the K-pop station, which is pretty rad. They've got a lot of

01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:34.800
songs under K-pop, including some songs you might recognize from DDR, such as Staryan.

01:13:34.800 --> 01:13:44.800
What's the other one? Caution is the other one. There's a Korean version of Venus. I

01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:50.240
don't think Face is in the home version. I think it was in the arcade somewhere, but

01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:55.160
It also has a Korean version of Venus, which is kind of cool.

01:13:55.160 --> 01:14:00.880
And then there's a pop channel, which mixes some songs that have been in arcade versions

01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:04.160
of Pump It Up previously, like Booby Law.

01:14:04.160 --> 01:14:06.600
I can't remember the name of the song, I just know it's the Booby song because it's the

01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:09.160
video that has just the chick with the boobs.

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:13.180
So Come Make It Round and Kiss Me as in Exceed 2.

01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:18.200
So there's a couple songs in the arcade, and then some interesting American exclusives.

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:22.740
Crystal Method is in there, and Elvis has a song in there.

01:14:22.740 --> 01:14:27.000
That one Australian band with the crazy video.

01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:29.560
I can't remember the name of the song.

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:31.960
The song is like, forget it, forget it.

01:14:34.760 --> 01:14:37.680
So I was a little bit apprehensive to play Pump It Up

01:14:37.680 --> 01:14:39.760
the first time, because I was kind of like,

01:14:39.760 --> 01:14:41.280
I don't like Pump It Up in the arcade.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:43.640
But I've just played old versions of Pump It Up,

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:46.600
I guess, because this interface is better than the old ones.

01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600
It's not as slow.

01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:52.920
it's a lot faster moving. And there's just a shitload of songs, which is pretty neat.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:55.760
Pump It Up takes some getting used to, though. You can't just go from DDR to Pump It Up,

01:14:55.760 --> 01:15:01.000
because even though it seems like, oh, well, they just tilted it 45 degrees and put a center

01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.360
button, yeah, but you have to read the arrows a whole different way. It's just a different

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:09.800
way of reading them with the colors and everything. So it's a little bit of a challenge at first.

01:15:09.800 --> 01:15:15.160
And there are some crazy-ass step patterns that shame in the groove step patterns, even,

01:15:15.160 --> 01:15:21.020
reasons of difficulty, if that's what you're into. But I think that kind of stuff is retarded,

01:15:21.020 --> 01:15:25.860
so I don't play that. So I didn't really, just, you know, my friend made me look at

01:15:25.860 --> 01:15:29.960
a few of the really, really tough step charts and I just kind of went stupid and went back

01:15:29.960 --> 01:15:35.220
to playing the more fun steps. So I actually really enjoy Pumping Up Exceed. I recommend

01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:38.780
it. If you guys are into the dance games, pick this up. This will hold you over until

01:15:38.780 --> 01:15:42.560
the DDR releases. Now granted, the downside is that you have to get a whole new pad with

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:47.600
this so the bundles gonna cost you about 60 bucks but the soft pad that comes

01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:53.200
with it is actually pretty darn nice it's it's a better quality than those

01:15:53.200 --> 01:16:03.880
konami soft pads they put out so pretty nice I enjoyed it what else is going on

01:16:03.880 --> 01:16:08.000
in the momani world right now besides me playing pump it up dance dance

01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:12.080
revolution strike yes right dance dance revolution strike was announced dance

01:16:12.080 --> 01:16:18.080
Dance Dance Revolution Strike is going to be, assumably now, Japan's version of EX2.

01:16:18.080 --> 01:16:19.080
Basically, EX2.

01:16:19.080 --> 01:16:23.000
It tells the story of a union dancer that decided that he's not going to take it anymore

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:27.200
and decided to strike.

01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:30.880
It's a very strange name, isn't it, for the game.

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:31.880
But whatever.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:38.080
Dance Dance Revolution Strike, the eye being an exclamation point, will be shown at the

01:16:38.080 --> 01:16:40.640
Tokyo Game Show 2005, so they say.

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:41.640
A couple days.

01:16:41.640 --> 01:16:46.240
it a couple days away. It's supposed to have that same interface as Extreme 2 and

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:51.560
Dancing Stage Max, of course, overseas in Europe. The website for the game also had

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:56.040
a special little page set up talking about the new Naoki song called Passion

01:16:56.040 --> 01:17:01.320
of Love. I almost thought it was Passion in Love. Passion of Love, Naoki featuring

01:17:01.320 --> 01:17:04.320
Politary. So you might remember the rumors a while back that Politary was in

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:07.520
studio recording something for Naoki. This is what it is, and it's going to be

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:14.620
featured in Dance Dance Revolution Strike. No word yet as to, no word yet as to whether

01:17:14.620 --> 01:17:20.940
it's going to be inside EX2 or the European version of Dance of the Sage Max as of yet.

01:17:20.940 --> 01:17:27.280
So we'll see. Sure it will be. Well yeah, I'm pretty sure it will be too, but nothing's,

01:17:27.280 --> 01:17:31.380
nothing said one way or the other yet. We don't know when this game will actually be

01:17:31.380 --> 01:17:46.180
coming out, but end of year, early next? 2006. 2006? Spring. 2006 it is, then. All right.

01:17:46.180 --> 01:17:50.460
We're going to go to a break. When we come back from this break, did your download finish?

01:17:50.460 --> 01:17:58.780
Almost? Try me back at about 8.30. Trying a little while? 8.30. All right. Ish. We'll

01:17:58.780 --> 01:18:07.220
do that. Stupid slow FTP. In this break, Loki wanted me to play something from the disc

01:18:07.220 --> 01:18:14.140
he brought last week. Yes! Finally! Finally! We picked up the new Diverse System albums,

01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:22.340
D7, all three CDs of that, D8, and also Dear Mr. Taka, plus some other special stuff like

01:18:22.340 --> 01:18:29.480
Like the Chorus K album and the good cool Ultra Expander CD, which has the most kickass

01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:36.660
remix to absolute, which you might have heard if you downloaded our non-show last week.

01:18:36.660 --> 01:18:39.380
And lots of good stuff.

01:18:39.380 --> 01:18:44.580
My personal favorite for D7, and I was waiting ever since I heard the little teaser for it,

01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:48.140
was the Trip Machine Dark Core mix.

01:18:48.140 --> 01:18:49.700
Awesome.

01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:54.040
There's a remix of Ecstasy on there, which is really cool.

01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.200
And a few other things.

01:18:55.200 --> 01:18:59.640
There's a remix of Love Love Shine, which is interesting.

01:18:59.640 --> 01:19:02.040
Okay, so what am I going to play here?

01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:03.040
Okay!

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:04.760
I think we should play the Trip Machine Dark Core Mix.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:05.760
Where's that?

01:19:05.760 --> 01:19:06.760
That's a D7.

01:19:06.760 --> 01:19:08.760
Oh, you have the wrong CD.

01:19:08.760 --> 01:19:10.760
Oh, dammit.

01:19:10.760 --> 01:19:13.960
Uh oh.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:14.960
This is the one, isn't it?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.560
The Dear Mr. Talk and all that stuff?

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.960
Nah, but this is my other one.

01:19:17.960 --> 01:19:18.960
There's a second CD.

01:19:18.960 --> 01:19:20.960
What's that on your thing over there?

01:19:20.960 --> 01:19:21.960
Is this it?

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:22.960
No.

01:19:22.960 --> 01:19:23.960
No, it's blank.

01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:24.960
Oh, crap.

01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:25.960
Oh!

01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:28.400
I have it around somewhere.

01:19:28.400 --> 01:19:29.400
I'll keep looking for it.

01:19:29.400 --> 01:19:30.400
Is there something on that CD?

01:19:30.400 --> 01:19:31.400
Yeah, well, fine.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.400
Let's see what's on here.

01:19:33.400 --> 01:19:39.840
Um, okay, actually, it might have been in a case for you.

01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.640
I think I put it in a case.

01:19:42.640 --> 01:19:43.640
Or something.

01:19:43.640 --> 01:19:44.640
No.

01:19:44.640 --> 01:19:46.640
No, that's not it.

01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:54.080
Um, so anyways, we've got some stuff on here. Um, the verse system stuff, um, we have Dear

01:19:54.080 --> 01:20:00.920
Mr. Taka, which is cool. Um, actually, um, let's play something from Good Cool Ultra

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:08.920
Expander. And, um, let's try, let's play, um, the Absolute Ultimate Remix again, because

01:20:08.920 --> 01:20:09.920
that's good.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:19.920
Alright, we're gonna play the Absolute Ultimate Remix, and it definitely lives up to its name, and...

01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.420
This is pretty cool. We heard a little bit of this last week, so...

01:20:22.420 --> 01:20:24.920
We will try to find the other CD in the meantime.

01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920
Alright, we will.

01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:30.920
We'll be back after this with more Orange Launch Radio and your phone calls.

01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.920
Lost down there for a minute. Oh, we will get to your phone calls this next break, we promise.

01:20:35.920 --> 01:20:40.920
Click on interact with us. So here it is, good cool with DJ Taka, absolute the ultimate mix.

01:23:35.920 --> 01:23:46.560
ninh Ly â€“ www.ninh.co.uk â€“ www.ninh.co.uk

01:24:35.920 --> 01:25:05.000
Alright, we found the other CDs, so we're gonna actually play one of the songs from

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:09.360
to verse 7 for you guys. And this is the one that Loki was hyping up here. It's the Trip

01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.240
Machine Dark Core Mix. And we're going to play that and then we're going to come back

01:25:15.240 --> 01:25:23.960
with more Orange Lawns Radio. Enjoy this one you guys. Who's the artist on this? I don't

01:25:23.960 --> 01:25:25.960
Just a verse system. Alright, here we go.

01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:55.960
Oh

01:26:23.960 --> 01:26:25.960
Oh

01:28:23.960 --> 01:28:25.960
Oh

01:29:23.960 --> 01:29:53.200
So that was some music from the new Diverse Systems 7 album.

01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:57.200
as new as Diverse Systems 8 though which is also out. Yeah. So look for those. And Diverse

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:03.520
9 which is coming. Coming very soon. Yeah. Alrighty. Very cool. And some people said

01:30:03.520 --> 01:30:07.760
they couldn't hear the trip machine. Yes. Our chat room was kind of going that's trip

01:30:07.760 --> 01:30:12.120
machine. I heard trip machine. I don't see how you couldn't. I've heard it. Yeah. The

01:30:12.120 --> 01:30:17.440
synth lines are the same. The synth lines are the same but where's my mommy can you

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:21.320
sing trip machine? Where was that? Where was that? The trip machine is like drum and bass

01:30:21.320 --> 01:30:25.660
and this is like Dark Horse, so it's a little different. I liked it. I thought it was cool,

01:30:25.660 --> 01:30:29.980
but... It was okay. It was okay. I think this is the only way to possibly light trip machines.

01:30:29.980 --> 01:30:34.700
There is an interesting... The double versions are horrible. There's a blues version of,

01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:45.460
or like, kind of like a jazzy blues type version of, I want to say, oh god, not Make Your Move,

01:30:45.460 --> 01:30:47.600
but like um... one of the older ones

01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:50.020
now put your faith in me uh...

01:30:50.020 --> 01:30:51.820
keep on moving

01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:54.540
that's on one of them too, we'll have to play that later, it's kind of funny

01:30:54.540 --> 01:31:00.220
but then they also have the long version of uh...

01:31:00.220 --> 01:31:03.860
made in innocent which was in uh... food mix 2

01:31:03.860 --> 01:31:04.980
or food mix

01:31:04.980 --> 01:31:07.720
plus i want to say

01:31:07.720 --> 01:31:12.420
yeah, food mix plus

01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:14.260
What we're going to do now, boys and girls, is we're going

01:31:14.260 --> 01:31:17.020
to head on over to the wide, wonderful world of Skype,

01:31:17.020 --> 01:31:19.980
which is the way that you can talk to us by giving us a

01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.500
call, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:31:22.500 --> 01:31:25.620
Click on Interact With Us for all the details you need on

01:31:25.620 --> 01:31:29.020
how you can call us via the Skype line.

01:31:29.020 --> 01:31:31.660
If you are already a Skype user, then you probably know

01:31:31.660 --> 01:31:32.540
how to use this program.

01:31:32.540 --> 01:31:36.020
All you've got to do is call username OrangeLoungeRadio.

01:31:36.020 --> 01:31:37.700
Who would have thought that our name would be

01:31:37.700 --> 01:31:39.940
OrangeLoungeRadio, all one word there on Skype?

01:31:39.940 --> 01:31:40.460
So weird.

01:31:40.460 --> 01:31:41.780
I know, we got really creative.

01:31:41.780 --> 01:31:47.780
We'll always sit there and wait for somebody to call us, because there's not a whole lot of people logged into Skype, so I don't know if we'll even get anything here.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:51.780
I do want to make sure this gets a mention here. This was something that happened while we were gone.

01:31:51.780 --> 01:31:57.780
Guitar Freaks and Drummania V2, on their way out.

01:31:57.780 --> 01:32:09.780
They do have a website opened up. We link to it from our website over at orangelandtrader.com, but it's konami.jp slash am slash location test, because this is something that's currently location testing.

01:32:09.780 --> 01:32:34.780
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, V2. And of course, the reason why Guitar Freaks and Drummania is now V is because they did a little bit of a hardware upgrade on the stuff there when they upgraded, or when they put out V. They did a little bit of a hardware upgrade, so now they have the full videos and everything, and the game's just a little bit prettier. So that's something to be looking forward to. Let's take a call. Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

01:32:34.780 --> 01:32:37.780
Hey Sky, Siggy here. Hello Siggy, how are you?

01:32:37.780 --> 01:32:42.780
I'm just doing fine after three weeks of being in San Francisco.

01:32:42.780 --> 01:32:43.780
What?

01:32:43.780 --> 01:32:44.780
It's been a long while.

01:32:44.780 --> 01:32:47.780
You were practically next door. What was going on in San Francisco?

01:32:47.780 --> 01:32:53.780
No, I just made, you know, my final visit to the city because my father just moved back here in Vegas.

01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:56.780
Oh, I got you. Okay, so you had family living in San Francisco.

01:32:56.780 --> 01:32:57.780
Mm-hmm.

01:32:57.780 --> 01:33:01.780
Oh, I got you. We should have said something. We could have all met up and played some 2DX.

01:33:01.780 --> 01:33:03.780
You could have whooped my ass or something. I don't know.

01:33:03.780 --> 01:33:06.980
I just got some GITADORA news for you.

01:33:06.980 --> 01:33:11.780
Okay, what's going on there? We just talked about Guitar Freaks and Drummania V2 a little bit.

01:33:11.780 --> 01:33:16.480
I got some song lists here that are official.

01:33:16.480 --> 01:33:21.980

01:35:10.900 --> 01:35:15.500
which is a cover by Asian kung-fu generation okay I think they've been in

And then the other song is Take My Hand by Maria Eva with Dreams Wing Kingdom.

01:36:03.580 --> 01:36:11.580
I remember back when I first started playing Guitar Freaks, you only got one song to pick from from Extra Stage, and you liked it.

01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:13.580
Sorry.

01:36:13.580 --> 01:36:17.580
And then the comeback song is Kachaka by Maki Deyaya.

01:36:17.580 --> 01:36:19.580

Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba. I like that song.

01:36:22.580 --> 01:36:23.580

I'm going to play Kachaka later in the show in celebration. Sorry.

01:36:26.580 --> 01:36:40.580
And then this was like back ago when Asaki's album was released. I will mention to you the songs for his first album called Shinkyoku, which means The Divine Comedy, which is a poem by Dante.

01:36:40.580 --> 01:36:44.580
Oh, yeah, I know that one. Okay. So they turned it into a song?

01:36:44.580 --> 01:36:45.580
Yeah.

01:36:45.580 --> 01:36:47.580
Okay, cool. Okay.

01:36:47.580 --> 01:36:48.820
okay

01:36:48.820 --> 01:36:54.100
uh... the first one is a sanity which means uh... chrysalis

01:36:54.100 --> 01:36:57.920
and then the second time is uh... a new news article dot what are you which

01:36:57.920 --> 01:37:00.140
means a firefly in

01:37:00.140 --> 01:37:03.380
and then the third song is up from popping music uh...

01:37:03.380 --> 01:37:06.820
about the popping music ten which is actually i was a little without

01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:08.980
which means uh...

01:37:08.980 --> 01:37:12.840
happiness uh... cabinet expressed in poetry

01:37:12.840 --> 01:37:15.740
and then uh... some of the board is uh... political not to know what you

01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.740
Which means seven congratulations from guitar fixdramania

01:37:18.740 --> 01:37:20.740
And then a new song called you kono otou

01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:23.740
Which means a sound of con-illocence

01:37:23.740 --> 01:37:25.740
And then there's ge kou-chou

01:37:25.740 --> 01:37:28.740
Which means moonlight butterfly from guitar fixdramania

01:37:28.740 --> 01:37:30.740
And then there's akai-su-su

01:37:30.740 --> 01:37:33.740

And then the self-titled single Shin-kyoku

01:37:42.740 --> 01:37:44.740
Which means the divine comedy

01:37:44.740 --> 01:37:51.740
And then the final song is Azumi no Hiyo Dorito, which means Azumi and her Volvo, which is a new song.

01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:55.740
For those of you who don't know what a Volvo is, a Volvo is a Persian songbird.

01:37:55.740 --> 01:37:59.740
Oh god, at first I thought you said her Volvo, and I'm like, oh, she's driving along in her Volvo.

01:37:59.740 --> 01:38:01.740
That's kind of weird that she's driving a Swedish car.

01:38:01.740 --> 01:38:02.740
It's spelled B-U-L-B-U-L.

01:38:02.740 --> 01:38:03.740
Okay, got it, okay.

01:38:03.740 --> 01:38:05.740
I don't have anything on there.

01:38:05.740 --> 01:38:06.740
All right.

01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.740
Well, that is very cool.

01:38:09.740 --> 01:38:11.740
So, some stuff to look forward to there.

01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:15.740
Any idea when this is going to be official as out of the location test?

01:38:15.740 --> 01:38:21.740
Well, the location test for Guitar Fix Romania V2, I'm not certain.

01:38:21.740 --> 01:38:28.740
They were doing the location test right now, as of now.

01:38:28.740 --> 01:38:35.740
So, usually what? The location test goes on for about a month, and then they go back for a month or two, and then the game comes out usually, right?

01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:42.500
Oh, I forgot to mention, about Tokyo Game Show, I checked on their website, and they

01:38:42.500 --> 01:38:46.600
just recently announced popinmusic throughout Edelhofer on Playstation 2.

01:38:46.600 --> 01:38:49.660
Big surprise, not.

01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:53.800
I mean, honestly, popinmusic's been constantly coming out for the Playstation 2, so that's

01:38:53.800 --> 01:38:57.420
no surprise at all, but that's good for the popinmusic fans, of course.

01:38:57.420 --> 01:38:58.420
Good news.

01:38:58.420 --> 01:38:59.420
All right.

01:38:59.420 --> 01:39:00.420
Sounds cool.

01:39:00.420 --> 01:39:03.100
Well, now, Tokyo Game Show's happening this week, right?

01:39:03.100 --> 01:39:04.100
Or is it next week?

01:39:04.100 --> 01:39:05.100
This Thursday.

01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:14.100
Awesome. So you gotta go, since I can't read the Japanese, you gotta go on some of those sites and look at the news and come back and let us know.

01:39:14.100 --> 01:39:15.100
No one else is good.

01:39:15.100 --> 01:39:16.100
What?

01:39:16.100 --> 01:39:20.100
Revolution news, they're gonna show the controller and everything in Mario 128.

01:39:20.100 --> 01:39:22.100
So we're gonna get a lot of news this week from Tokyo Game Show.

01:39:22.100 --> 01:39:23.100
Oh yeah, that'd be exciting.

01:39:23.100 --> 01:39:25.100
Alright. Alright.

01:39:25.100 --> 01:39:28.100
Yeah, and one more thing.

01:39:28.100 --> 01:39:32.100
Uh, it's not KeKak, it's KeChak.

01:39:32.100 --> 01:39:33.100
KeChak.

01:39:33.100 --> 01:39:34.100
I like KeKak.

01:39:34.100 --> 01:39:38.100
No, you have to go to Indonesia. Believe me, it's Kecak.

01:39:38.100 --> 01:39:43.100
I don't doubt that the pronunciation I'm doing is horribly wrong, but, you know, I like Kecak.

01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:49.100
Alright, Kecak. I said it once correctly, just for you. Alright.

01:39:49.100 --> 01:39:57.100
Yeah, and, you know, just after I go off, just announce to them about a tent-style CS.

01:39:57.100 --> 01:39:59.100
Uh-huh.

01:39:59.100 --> 01:40:02.100
Yeah, I really, you know, I really pre-ordered mine.

01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:05.100
When's the street date for that? Isn't that October?

01:40:05.100 --> 01:40:06.100
November 17th.

01:40:06.100 --> 01:40:07.100
November 17th.

01:40:07.100 --> 01:40:08.100
Yeah.

01:40:08.100 --> 01:40:11.100
So don't you remember last year in November was like a huge month for Bomani?

01:40:11.100 --> 01:40:16.100
Because we got like UltraMix 2, 8 style, and Pop'n Music like 10 I think it was?

01:40:16.100 --> 01:40:17.100
All in like the same day.

01:40:17.100 --> 01:40:27.100
And remember, as I mentioned on the non-show, that the new DDRs and the new Carrique Revolutions are gonna have demos for each different version.

01:40:27.100 --> 01:40:28.100
That's out there now.

01:40:28.100 --> 01:40:36.100
One of the news sites published that in their review, so that's out there now where everybody knows that you can play demos, one and the other.

01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:41.100
And I still envy those people at Rhode Island right now, because they have Happy Sky!

01:40:41.100 --> 01:40:50.100
I heard! You know, I was talking to Miklotov over the weekend, and he said that he damn near got on a plane to go out there to play it, and I was like, you're crazy!

01:40:50.100 --> 01:40:55.100
Well, if you've got your simulators out there, I have all the key-sounded BMS files for Happy Sky.

01:40:55.100 --> 01:40:58.100
I guess if you want a cheap knockoff, there's a way to do it.

01:40:58.100 --> 01:41:00.100
Or if you like the remix stuff.

01:41:00.100 --> 01:41:03.100
Well, that's true too. Remix with the key sounds is good.

01:41:03.100 --> 01:41:04.100
That's cool.

01:41:04.100 --> 01:41:07.100
Well, are you going to be taking a trip out to Rhode Island anytime soon then?

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:10.100
No thanks. I'd rather not.

01:41:10.100 --> 01:41:11.100
That's what I figured.

01:41:11.100 --> 01:41:12.100
In Rhode Island?

01:41:12.100 --> 01:41:14.100
Well, there's Happy Sky.

01:41:14.100 --> 01:41:16.100
Lobster.

01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:19.100
All right. Anything else you wanted to share with us tonight, Ziggy?

01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:23.100
Not much else. I'll just let you know what news are going to come out.

01:41:23.100 --> 01:41:24.100
Sounds good.

01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:26.100
Tokyo Game Show

01:41:54.100 --> 01:41:58.100
My timer didn't show up there for a minute there.

01:41:58.100 --> 01:42:01.100
DarkSakura is not a fella.

01:42:01.100 --> 01:42:04.100
Hey honey, what's up?

01:42:04.100 --> 01:42:06.100
How you doing? What's on your mind?

01:42:06.100 --> 01:42:09.100
Not much. I got some information here.

01:42:09.100 --> 01:42:12.100
First things first, I don't know if you guys noticed, but

01:42:12.100 --> 01:42:17.100
it seems that Katamari Damacy 2 or We Love Katamari came out early.

01:42:17.100 --> 01:42:18.100
It came out early?

01:42:18.100 --> 01:42:20.100
Nope.

01:42:20.100 --> 01:42:23.100
Okay, the guy who works for the game distributor says no.

01:42:23.100 --> 01:42:29.100
Well, um, I have a link here to somebody who went to Target and bought it today.

01:42:29.100 --> 01:42:32.100
Nope. Target broke street.

01:42:32.100 --> 01:42:33.100
Yeah, they just...

01:42:33.100 --> 01:42:36.100
That's exactly what I said when I found it earlier.

01:42:36.100 --> 01:42:41.100
It doesn't come out until the 21st. It got pushed back because they weren't done with it yet. It hasn't even been pressed yet.

01:42:41.100 --> 01:42:43.100
Wait, but how do they go to Target and get a copy then?

01:42:43.100 --> 01:42:45.100
I don't know if I know.

01:42:45.100 --> 01:42:46.100
Interesting.

01:42:46.100 --> 01:42:50.820
They really did a really shitty job of making new box art for it.

01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.260
Yeah, the cover art shit.

01:42:52.260 --> 01:42:53.340
So OK, give me this link.

01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:54.340
I want to look at it.

01:42:54.340 --> 01:42:55.020
Right there.

01:42:55.020 --> 01:42:57.600
All right, let's see.

01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.340
Let's see what this is all about right here.

01:42:59.340 --> 01:43:03.620
OK, so this link got posted in our chat room, www.orangelaungeradio.com.

01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:12.300
Orangelaungeradio.com slash chat, or I'm sorry, click on the link that says

01:43:12.300 --> 01:43:13.220
chat.

01:43:13.220 --> 01:43:13.820
And here it is.

01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.380
Somebody posted, go to Target now.

01:43:15.380 --> 01:43:19.020
They've got their little target bag with the receipt and the little game. We heart katamari

01:43:19.700 --> 01:43:21.700
Sony software

01:43:22.420 --> 01:43:24.220
$29.99

01:43:24.220 --> 01:43:29.660
Interesting, I don't know whatever so they broke street date. Well, they don't really have street dates for games

01:43:29.660 --> 01:43:32.620
It's like kind of whenever they get them, but they're direct with the law

01:43:32.620 --> 01:43:35.300
Hello to people with different beg to differ with you

01:43:35.300 --> 01:43:41.020
Well some date some companies to street dated games, but this one's not supposed to come out until the 21st

01:43:41.020 --> 01:43:43.140
that's the last info we got on it and

01:43:43.140 --> 01:43:48.140
And that's straight from Namco. I mean, that's Namco people telling me, so...

01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.140
That's very weird.

01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:50.140
Yeah, that's understandable.

01:43:50.140 --> 01:43:51.140
But, you know, street dates...

01:43:51.140 --> 01:43:53.140
I'm heading up Target.com to see if it was just that store.

01:43:53.140 --> 01:43:58.140
Street dates change all the time, and stuff gets sent out, you know, it'll go gold, you know.

01:43:58.140 --> 01:44:01.140
Something will be pushed back, and then it'll come out that day, you know.

01:44:01.140 --> 01:44:02.140
It's just, like, it's weird shit.

01:44:02.140 --> 01:44:05.140
Like, for example, Graffiti Kingdom.

01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:06.140
The company sent out press releases.

01:44:06.140 --> 01:44:07.140
Oh, yeah, we shipped everything.

01:44:07.140 --> 01:44:12.140
It didn't come out for two weeks later, you know, so it's hard to say.

01:44:12.140 --> 01:44:14.140
Where's that dude live? Do we know?

01:44:14.140 --> 01:44:19.140
I don't know. I just found the link early too when I was at my friend's dorm. We were playing video games.

01:44:19.140 --> 01:44:21.140
Let's find out which Target that is.

01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:26.140
Okay. Just to say something about on the Target website.

01:44:26.140 --> 01:44:31.140
It says this item will be released on September 22nd and you can pre-order it.

01:44:31.140 --> 01:44:32.140
Interesting.

01:44:32.140 --> 01:44:38.140
So it's just this one story. In Indianapolis, Indiana it looks like is where this person says they live.

01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:44.980
So, if you are living in the Indianapolis area, start calling those targets and see

01:44:44.980 --> 01:44:49.800
if you can't get your cams on the game because somehow they got a copy of it.

01:44:49.800 --> 01:44:54.380
Or it's a really cleverly done Photoshop, but I don't know why this guy would Photoshop

01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:55.380
it.

01:44:55.380 --> 01:44:58.100
No, it could also be like for some whatever reason they got a promo copy and the dumb

01:44:58.100 --> 01:45:01.460
asses put it out the cell and that was like the only copy that they had.

01:45:01.460 --> 01:45:02.460
Oh, I see.

01:45:02.460 --> 01:45:03.460
But you never know.

01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.100
I mean, stupid things like that happen.

01:45:05.100 --> 01:45:15.100
I noticed that on the receipt here, it says the Sony software, the actual name of the game isn't there, like it's a generic code in there or something.

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:21.100
But does it have what the disc number is? You know how each disc has an ID number on it?

01:45:21.100 --> 01:45:22.100
Yeah, it had a little number on it, I think.

01:45:22.100 --> 01:45:23.100
What's the number then?

01:45:23.100 --> 01:45:24.100
Hey, there's a number there.

01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:26.100
Hold on, hold on, let me check.

01:45:26.100 --> 01:45:28.100
Ah, what a time for my mouse to be dying.

01:45:28.100 --> 01:45:31.100
If I understand, somebody in California bought it.

01:45:31.100 --> 01:45:39.740
That doesn't matter anyways, I have the Japanese version, I mean, what do I care?

01:45:39.740 --> 01:45:44.860
I was just going to say, I was going to look up here, see if it matches, we live Katamari.

01:45:44.860 --> 01:45:49.740
Well, that's very interesting if it did come out a little early.

01:45:49.740 --> 01:45:53.500
Some folks should just consider themselves lucky and maybe the game will be making its

01:45:53.500 --> 01:45:59.740
way, but as far as we know, no official word from Namco or any gaming site for that matter

01:45:59.740 --> 01:46:03.140
that the game has come out early. And I would think if the game shipped early, Namco would

01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:06.280
be shouting it from the mountaintops and all the gaming sites would pick that up because

01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:09.180
everybody has a boner for Katamari Damacy.

01:46:09.180 --> 01:46:17.500
Perfect example. Look at Shane. He got someone returned to pump it up to one of the stores

01:46:17.500 --> 01:46:22.380
and he bought it used. And this was before the game even came out. I mean, so, stuff

01:46:22.380 --> 01:46:27.260
like this happens. I mean, people will buy something or get something for free from,

01:46:27.260 --> 01:46:30.900
You know, they're a distributor or a vendor or whatever and they'll return it back to

01:46:30.900 --> 01:46:32.740
a store and then sell it.

01:46:32.740 --> 01:46:36.960
Or in this case, they might get a promo copy early, because I've had, you know, a few copies

01:46:36.960 --> 01:46:42.940
of stuff early before it's treated and, you know, someone goes and sells it or mistakenly

01:46:42.940 --> 01:46:45.740
puts it out on the shelf, you never know.

01:46:45.740 --> 01:46:52.680
Or whatever the company is, if they're shipping it in one day, you know.

01:46:52.680 --> 01:46:55.580
Because I remember the same thing happened last year with the PS2 minis.

01:46:55.580 --> 01:46:59.300
I mean, I found out that Target put it out three weeks early,

01:46:59.300 --> 01:47:04.380
and then a week later, Best Buy, we put it out the following week.

01:47:04.380 --> 01:47:05.180
Interesting.

01:47:05.180 --> 01:47:07.260
Hey, chat room's bringing up an interesting point.

01:47:07.260 --> 01:47:09.900
Did you say your friend got this in California?

01:47:09.900 --> 01:47:12.540
Yeah, that's what the receipt says.

01:47:12.540 --> 01:47:16.060
Very interesting, but your friend's user info says he lives in, oh,

01:47:16.060 --> 01:47:19.060
maybe he didn't buy this, but he found this picture somewhere.

01:47:19.060 --> 01:47:19.780
That could be it.

01:47:19.780 --> 01:47:22.540
You can see on here, it says Mission Viejo.

01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:25.060
Mission Viejo is right there on the, that's

01:47:25.060 --> 01:47:29.300
the city in Southern California or San Diego San Diego area so if you in the

01:47:29.300 --> 01:47:33.660
San Diego area it's Mission Viejo look you can even call the target should we

i don't know we'll see either either way my caller id is blocked so that's what's

01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:22.820
important right we're now calling a target store printed

01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:28.020
on the receipt. Mission Viejo, California, see if they have Weheart, Katamari, and stuff.

01:48:28.020 --> 01:48:30.820
Damn it, I just picked up another call. Zachary, you gotta call us back in a little bit, okay?

01:48:31.460 --> 01:48:35.940
All right. All right, later. All right. I'm still new to Skype. Okay, here we go.

01:48:35.940 --> 01:48:42.940

01:48:53.060 --> 01:48:59.900
three ringy dingys

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.100
Poor ringy dingies.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:08.300
Nobody's home at Target.

01:49:11.700 --> 01:49:14.900
Apparently, yeah, they're too busy selling advanced copies of We Heart Katamari.

01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:18.700
Live radio, ladies and gentlemen.

01:49:22.300 --> 01:49:24.100
Someone let Target know their phone's off the hook.

01:49:24.100 --> 01:49:30.020
One more ring and then we're hanging up.

01:49:30.020 --> 01:49:35.420
Very interesting. Not only that, but bad customer service.

01:49:35.420 --> 01:49:38.900
Maybe they're closed. They could close at eight on Sunday, I guess.

01:49:38.900 --> 01:49:41.220
No. Interesting.

01:49:41.220 --> 01:49:46.220
Oh fuck, they're onto us.

01:49:46.220 --> 01:49:47.860
Alright, we called. No answer.

01:49:47.860 --> 01:49:49.100
What can we do?

01:49:54.540 --> 01:49:55.540
So we'll see what happens.

01:49:55.540 --> 01:49:56.180
Now the chat room is.

01:49:56.180 --> 01:49:58.020
I'm looking through this one thread that was

01:49:58.020 --> 01:50:00.220
linked in the chat room.

01:50:00.220 --> 01:50:01.460
Are they saying the same thing?

01:50:01.460 --> 01:50:03.820
Someone actually had a very good challenge for the guy.

01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:07.860
He said, post a copy of the, well, he put up a picture of

01:50:07.860 --> 01:50:09.100
the disk in the manual.

01:50:09.100 --> 01:50:10.300
One second.

01:50:10.300 --> 01:50:11.020
Interesting.

01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:12.220
Well, let's see what happens.

01:50:12.220 --> 01:50:13.780
All right, we're going to go to another call real quick

01:50:13.780 --> 01:50:17.140
here, since our brilliant live radio experiment didn't work

01:50:17.140 --> 01:50:21.860
out very well. Yeah, because really you could, I don't know. Hi, you're on Orange Launch

01:50:21.860 --> 01:50:26.620
Radio. Yeah, you already know who this is. Hi, Saku, you know Target's closed, actually.

01:50:26.620 --> 01:50:30.020
Yeah. I just wanted to share with you, Target's closed. Yeah, you're seven, you're about almost

01:50:30.020 --> 01:50:36.340
20 minutes, you were like 20 minutes late right there. Well. Had you known this like,

01:50:36.340 --> 01:50:40.940
maybe, you know, 20 minutes earlier, or probably 30 minutes earlier, you probably would've

01:50:40.940 --> 01:50:47.940
Ron Chan, frickin' earlier next time. Be on time next time. No, I'm kidding, it's fine.

01:50:47.940 --> 01:50:49.940
What's on your mind, Zaku?

01:50:49.940 --> 01:50:56.940
Nah, just calling back. I'm in school right now. Moved back on campus a couple of weeks ago.

01:50:56.940 --> 01:50:58.940
Congratulations.

01:50:58.940 --> 01:51:07.940
Yeah, and I still miss playing in the groove in the city. I miss that because I'm like 30 miles upstate from the city,

01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:14.980
So we don't even have In the Groove up here, I mean we used to have, but you know, if I'm

01:51:14.980 --> 01:51:18.060
going to get my fix I have to go back into the city and all.

01:51:18.060 --> 01:51:21.780
Well one of these days I'm going to go down into Sacramento and play In the Groove 2 that

01:51:21.780 --> 01:51:24.780
we have here, but I'm just lazy.

01:51:24.780 --> 01:51:26.540
What city is this so we can completely avoid it?

01:51:26.540 --> 01:51:27.820
New York.

01:51:27.820 --> 01:51:28.820
What city?

01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:29.820
City of New York.

01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:30.820
City City, New York?

01:51:30.820 --> 01:51:31.940
Yeah, the city of New York.

01:51:31.940 --> 01:51:34.460
I thought they had an In the Groove Chinatown.

01:51:34.460 --> 01:51:40.460
Yes, not only that, but in Coney Island, Queens, Staten Island, I mean, it's starting to spread like cancer.

01:51:40.460 --> 01:51:43.460
Interesting analogy!

01:51:43.460 --> 01:51:45.460
That's a lovely thought.

01:51:45.460 --> 01:51:49.460
That and just missing playing 2DX11 Red, I just need that fixed.

01:51:49.460 --> 01:51:51.460
So it's kind of spreading like New Jersey?

01:51:51.460 --> 01:51:56.460
No, it's just spreading like your mama's legs! Oh, burn!

01:51:56.460 --> 01:51:59.460
Nah, New Jersey's just the smell. I was in Philly.

01:51:59.460 --> 01:52:03.540
yeah anyway what else is on your mind besides lack of the money

01:52:03.540 --> 01:52:07.300
not just you know all that you should they just came out

01:52:07.300 --> 01:52:11.780
well the new info whatever you know I'm not gonna be able to make it to digital

01:52:11.780 --> 01:52:12.180
life

01:52:12.180 --> 01:52:17.060
I want to come sucks I tried to schedule my boss but she'd schedule me for a

01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:20.300
full week class right there so I'm not gonna be able to do it mom but I hope you

01:52:20.300 --> 01:52:23.180
guys have fun I tried I will I will definitely come next year

01:52:23.180 --> 01:52:27.220
I know man we'll just hope it still happens next year

01:52:27.220 --> 01:52:33.220
I hope so, too. Well, we need somebody on the inside taking some pictures and sending them to us, so take some pictures over there.

01:52:33.220 --> 01:52:35.220
I wish I had a digital camera.

01:52:35.220 --> 01:52:36.220
Are you practicing for your freestyle?

01:52:36.220 --> 01:52:39.220
Uh, I don't know about that. I need a job first.

01:52:39.220 --> 01:52:40.220
Oh.

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.220
I'm still unemployed.

01:52:41.220 --> 01:52:42.220
Oh.

01:52:42.220 --> 01:52:43.220
Get your resume on Monster.

01:52:43.220 --> 01:52:44.220
Hey, join the club!

01:52:44.220 --> 01:52:45.220
Nine months now.

01:52:45.220 --> 01:52:46.220
Get your resume on Monster.

01:52:46.220 --> 01:52:47.220
And Craigslist.

01:52:47.220 --> 01:52:49.220
Dude, I've tried that already.

01:52:49.220 --> 01:52:59.220
When you've been trying to find work for the past nine months, you kind of realize that there's probably no light at the end of the tunnel.

01:52:59.220 --> 01:53:04.220
And to make it worse, I don't even get work study this year.

01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:09.220
You know what? Apply at Target because you'll never have to work past eight on a Sunday.

01:53:09.220 --> 01:53:13.220
You'll always be home in time for Orange Line.

01:53:13.220 --> 01:53:20.220
I just hope so. I hope they don't make me work on, I don't know about making me work on weekends. I hope I can find a job that revolves around my schedule.

01:53:20.220 --> 01:53:27.220
Well, there are some employers out there that will work with you if you're in school. It's possible to find, but you know, you are going to have to kind of look at the bottom.

01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:32.220
And a lot of schools also have temporary services where you can actually work on campus around your own hours.

01:53:32.220 --> 01:53:39.220
I've already exhausted those means of working on campus. They've already filled, I mean the jobs have already filled up.

01:53:39.220 --> 01:53:43.660
and people want work-study, you know, in order to be tired.

01:53:43.660 --> 01:53:46.140
Stop, stop.

01:53:46.140 --> 01:53:50.300
Yeah, it's really bad for me because I probably waited like almost a week to

01:53:50.300 --> 01:53:52.140
even be, you know, to even

01:53:52.140 --> 01:53:56.180
you know, find out that I didn't have work-study, so

01:53:56.180 --> 01:54:00.100
as I said, I'm up a shit's creek right now. I'm just hoping I get some

01:54:00.100 --> 01:54:02.440
jobs that I applied to

01:54:02.440 --> 01:54:05.460
and we'll see what happens from there. Well, good luck to you.

01:54:05.460 --> 01:54:09.940
I hope that, you know, you find something. Just check with the big, big companies, like,

01:54:09.940 --> 01:54:13.380
you know, the Targets, the Walmarts, the Toys R Us's, and whatever, so.

01:54:13.380 --> 01:54:21.980
Alright, well, have a good one, Zaku, and good luck on the job hunt, and hope you find

01:54:21.980 --> 01:54:29.340
those Bonwani games, okay? Alright, later, bye.

01:54:29.340 --> 01:54:34.540
Okay, now, on the chat room, it sounds like that they actually looked up this Target,

01:54:34.540 --> 01:54:38.660
and the damn store is open. So is there only one target in Mission Viejo, or is there more

01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:44.300
than one target? See, maybe there's more than one target in the town, so the one you guys

01:54:44.300 --> 01:54:47.140
are looking at might not be the right one. But Mission Viejo is not that big, is it?

01:54:47.140 --> 01:54:49.380
I don't think it is. Don't know.

01:54:49.380 --> 01:54:54.300
On that one thread, by the way, someone said they worked at Target and got a shipment of

01:54:54.300 --> 01:54:57.860
it in, so went ahead and bought us a game. Really?

01:54:57.860 --> 01:55:02.040
They said they got very few copies in. Interesting. Okay, well, here's the correct

01:55:02.040 --> 01:55:06.040
Maybe, did we mis-dial their number? Let me look at what we dialed last time.

01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:10.040
949, oh, we totally dialed the wrong number last time. Well, let's try it again.

01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:14.040
Okay, now we've got the right target number. Thank you,

01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.040
chat room.

01:55:22.040 --> 01:55:26.040
Thank you for calling the Mission Viejo Target Store. Our normal

01:55:26.040 --> 01:55:30.040
store business hours are Monday through Saturday,

01:55:30.040 --> 01:55:38.040
8 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday 8 a.m. to 9 p.m.

01:55:38.040 --> 01:55:44.040
We are located on Alicia Parkway off the 5 freeway between Charlinda and the 5 freeway.

01:55:44.040 --> 01:55:48.040
If you are calling the Target Pharmacy, please press 1.

01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:54.040
If you speak to the store operator, please wait or press 0.

01:55:54.040 --> 01:55:59.040
I guess we get the operator.

01:55:59.040 --> 01:56:03.040
Please stay on the line while your call is transferred to the operator.

01:56:12.040 --> 01:56:15.040
Good evening Target, this is Sue, how can I direct your call?

01:56:15.040 --> 01:56:18.040
Yes, can I speak to somebody in electronics please?

01:56:18.040 --> 01:56:19.040
Sure.

01:56:25.040 --> 01:56:26.040
Electronics?

01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:32.040
Yeah, I was looking to see if you had a PlayStation 2 game in stock. It's We Love Katamari.

01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:34.040
Let me check, hang on.

01:56:34.040 --> 01:56:39.040
Yeah, I see. Those are on the next aisle.

01:56:39.040 --> 01:56:41.040
I'm sorry, what was the game again?

01:56:41.040 --> 01:56:44.040
It's We Love Katamari.

01:56:44.040 --> 01:56:46.040
Yeah, we have one left.

01:56:46.040 --> 01:56:47.040
You do have one left in stock.

01:56:47.040 --> 01:56:48.040
Yes, we do.

01:56:48.040 --> 01:56:49.040
Okay, great. Thank you.

01:56:49.040 --> 01:56:50.040
Uh-huh.

01:56:50.040 --> 01:56:52.040
Alright, bye-bye.

01:56:52.040 --> 01:56:54.040
One left, kids! Get your asses in gear!

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:58.040
here and get down there and pick that shit up. One left in stock.

01:56:58.040 --> 01:57:02.040
I'll have to talk to my folks at Namco and see what's going on.

01:57:02.040 --> 01:57:06.040
Go figure. You heard it here first, boys and girls.

01:57:06.040 --> 01:57:10.040
We gonna rat them out, yo. We frickin' called them

01:57:10.040 --> 01:57:14.040
and they have one copy left in stock. You go post that on Game Tax right now.

01:57:14.040 --> 01:57:18.040
I think I'm gonna make a stop by Target tomorrow after I get out from the chiropractor.

01:57:18.040 --> 01:57:22.040
You want to call the one down up the street here?

01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:30.040
Dude, if they have it, I'm going to give Neil money to get mine now.

01:57:30.040 --> 01:57:35.040
Except that I have mine on reserve at GameStop and I can get it for 30% off.

01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040
Are we going to call him right now?

01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:41.040
Well, it's 30% off later or full price now.

01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:44.040
I can't believe we're doing this live on air.

01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:47.040
I think we have better things to talk about.

01:57:47.040 --> 01:57:49.040
But dammit, we might get our Katamari fix tonight.

01:57:49.040 --> 01:57:50.040
Alright, here's the number, Neil.

01:57:50.040 --> 01:57:51.480
We caught a Mario ready!

01:57:51.480 --> 01:57:52.600
I'm calling GameStop real quick.

01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.320
6384971.

01:57:57.320 --> 01:57:58.440
All right.

01:57:58.440 --> 01:57:59.480
Bugs going to call him.

01:57:59.480 --> 01:58:02.200
And in the meantime, we're going to go to a break.

01:58:02.200 --> 01:58:03.160
When we come back from the break,

01:58:03.160 --> 01:58:04.000
we'll let you know what happened.

01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:05.960
And we'll get into the Orange Lounge Radio Cage Match.

01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:07.520
And we've got a couple other Bamani stories

01:58:07.520 --> 01:58:08.560
for you guys tonight.

01:58:08.560 --> 01:58:10.440
So we will be back after this.

01:58:10.440 --> 01:58:13.240
Started off with a little bit of the captain, the good captain

01:58:13.240 --> 01:58:14.240
here.

01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.160
You listening to Orange Lounge Radio?

01:58:16.160 --> 01:58:37.760
Dream on, dream on, but take me in a dream Take me anywhere you please, boy you're making me scream Dream on, dream on, but nothing's just a dream If you want to set me free, boy you're making me scream Ooh, la-da-dee, la-da-da You've got to dream on, dream on, dream on

01:58:46.160 --> 01:58:59.160
Oh, one more time, I'm back with a new rhyme Hey, here we go again, turn it up my friend

01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:05.160
No, we don't stop, we rock the spot No, we don't quit, get ready or this is it

01:59:05.160 --> 01:59:07.160
Do you like the dream?

01:59:07.160 --> 01:59:10.160
Hey, I like the dream baby Do you like the dream?

01:59:10.160 --> 01:59:14.160
Oh, I like the dream mama Do you like the scream?

01:59:14.160 --> 01:59:19.160
Hey, I like to scream, baby Do you like to scream? Oh, scream it out

01:59:19.160 --> 01:59:26.160
Dream of a dream of a living in your dreams It's the end of real things for you making me scream

01:59:26.160 --> 01:59:33.160
Dream of dreams of the nothing but the dream If you want to let me scream for you making me scream

02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:38.160
I'm feeling all like a robot, yeah

02:02:51.160 --> 02:02:53.160
Baby do you want the truth?

02:02:53.160 --> 02:02:55.160
Baby do you want it?

02:02:55.160 --> 02:02:57.160
Baby do you want the truth?

02:02:57.160 --> 02:02:58.440
7, 2, 1

02:04:27.160 --> 02:04:32.160
When you ask me to do my own thing, it's a lie

02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:35.160
So I quit, it's a lie

02:05:05.160 --> 02:05:21.000
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and the hunt is on.

02:05:21.000 --> 02:05:24.520
I think I've heard about five different Target stores being called in the area during that

02:05:24.520 --> 02:05:26.200
break looking for We Heart Katamari.

02:05:26.200 --> 02:05:29.600
Of course, if you're just joining us, we actually called.

02:05:29.600 --> 02:05:30.880
There was a picture on the internet.

02:05:30.880 --> 02:05:36.800
Some kid said he went to the Mission Viejo California Target Store, looked for a copy

02:05:36.800 --> 02:05:41.100
of We Heart Katamari and he got it and we just called because we thought that this whole

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:42.560
thing might have been bogus or BS.

02:05:42.560 --> 02:05:46.700
We called and the guy, they didn't know that we were a radio show or anything, we just

02:05:46.700 --> 02:05:49.700
called and the guy said one copy left.

02:05:49.700 --> 02:05:56.880
So if you're lucky enough to be in the San Diego Mission Viejo area, get your ass a target

02:05:56.880 --> 02:06:08.280
before nine o'clock and you can thank us later. That's great. All right. You know what's sad

02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:12.720
is after we cover that on our podcast tonight, that poor store is going to get a shitload

02:06:12.720 --> 02:06:19.240
of inquiries about that game. Power of the internet. You know what's sad also? I'm going

02:06:19.240 --> 02:06:23.320
to rat them out. Don't rat them out. Oh yeah, I'm ratting them out. Don't rat them out.

02:06:23.320 --> 02:06:26.120
I'm ratting them out. Wait until somebody picks up that game because maybe it'll be

02:06:26.120 --> 02:06:27.120
good enough to give us an iso.

02:06:27.120 --> 02:06:28.120
Well, then they better hurry.

02:06:28.120 --> 02:06:29.120
I'm gonna random out.

02:06:29.120 --> 02:06:30.120
Cause, you know, Namco's gonna call tomorrow.

02:06:30.120 --> 02:06:31.120
We'll see what happens.

02:06:31.120 --> 02:06:32.120
Nah, I don't care, really.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:33.120
Well, actually, what's interesting is that, um, uh, the only reason I'd be pissed off

02:06:33.120 --> 02:06:34.120
is because we didn't get ours on time.

02:06:34.120 --> 02:06:35.120
Because, you know, it was supposed to come out, you know, I think, last week, and they

02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:36.120
pushed it back.

02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:37.120
So, you know what?

02:06:37.120 --> 02:06:38.120
That's my bitterness.

02:06:38.120 --> 02:06:39.120
Thanks.

02:06:39.120 --> 02:06:40.120
Thanks.

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:41.120
Bye.

02:06:41.120 --> 02:06:42.120
Bye.

02:06:42.120 --> 02:06:43.120
Bye.

02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:44.120
Bye.

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:45.120
Bye.

02:06:45.120 --> 02:06:50.680
to come out you know I think last week and they pushed it back so you know what

02:06:50.680 --> 02:07:04.920
that's my bitterness all right the chat rooms yelling at us here I don't know if

02:07:04.920 --> 02:07:11.960
somebody lives in that area or something we'll see um doo-doo-doo-doo where was I

02:07:11.960 --> 02:07:16.520
lost track now because of all this we heart katamari madness here let me post

02:07:16.520 --> 02:07:21.000
that link one more time for you guys looking for that mission Viejo target I

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:25.160
have a slight update there's one in the area they have them in they have them

02:07:25.160 --> 02:07:29.080
but they aren't putting them out on the shelf till Tuesday till Tuesday till

02:07:29.080 --> 02:07:32.960
this Tuesday okay who's doing it Roseville the old one the old Roseville

02:07:32.960 --> 02:07:38.720
one interesting because there's like two or three in Roseville now huh so that's

02:07:38.720 --> 02:07:40.720
That's the one on Douglas Boulevard.

02:07:40.720 --> 02:07:42.720
Interesting.

02:07:42.720 --> 02:07:46.720
Do you have a game called We Love Katamari for PS2 and stuff?

02:07:46.720 --> 02:07:49.720
So it's somehow getting out early to targets?

02:07:49.720 --> 02:07:51.720
Yeah.

02:07:51.720 --> 02:07:53.720
Just cover them by my house and they don't...

02:07:53.720 --> 02:07:54.720
Interesting.

02:07:54.720 --> 02:07:56.720
Alright.

02:07:56.720 --> 02:08:00.720
There's going to be some calls made this morning. Let me put it that way.

02:08:00.720 --> 02:08:07.720
Do you know the other thought is that what if Namco is purposefully leaking this out to produce excitement over the game's release?

02:08:07.720 --> 02:08:10.720
I don't think so. They're not that smart.

02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:13.720
Actually, I worked for Namco and yes, they've done stuff like this in the past.

02:08:13.720 --> 02:08:15.720
I don't think so. I doubt it.

02:08:15.720 --> 02:08:22.720
I think this is just more of an error in someone's shipping department.

02:08:22.720 --> 02:08:25.720
Now the chat room's going, call my target. Call my target.

02:08:25.720 --> 02:08:28.720
Fuck you. Call your own target. Seriously.

02:08:28.720 --> 02:08:30.720
The hell? We're not calling all your damn targets.

02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:35.720
We are not the goddamn operator. Call your own fucking target.

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:40.360
Pick up your phone, dial the little numbers, and ask them yourself, just like we did with

02:08:40.360 --> 02:08:41.360
six different stores.

02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:42.360
Thank you.

02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:44.980
You see how easy it is?

02:08:44.980 --> 02:08:46.160
I did it.

02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:47.160
You can do it.

02:08:47.160 --> 02:08:49.160
The phone is easy to use.

02:08:49.160 --> 02:08:53.960
You learn how to do this when you're three.

02:08:53.960 --> 02:08:54.960
Hit the button.

02:08:54.960 --> 02:08:57.960
If you have that much trouble, get your mommy to call.

02:08:57.960 --> 02:09:02.760
You shouldn't be getting this game anyways if you have that much trouble dialing a phone.

02:09:02.760 --> 02:09:07.760
Obviously don't have the hand-eye coordination enough to use the controller to play the game.

02:09:07.760 --> 02:09:14.760
If you're having trouble using the phone, you've got a serious problem, and you probably need help going P2.

02:09:14.760 --> 02:09:19.760
Do you need someone to help you do the wipe? Or how about the flush?

02:09:19.760 --> 02:09:25.760
Alright, we're getting like a million requests for the clip of the phone call.

02:09:25.760 --> 02:09:30.760
So we'll, I don't know, put it in the live chat. Please!

02:09:30.760 --> 02:09:38.840
Post it to our forums, please, because my work firewalled live journals, so I can't

02:09:38.840 --> 02:09:39.840
do that no more.

02:09:39.840 --> 02:09:40.840
We'll see.

02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:41.840
Shame on them.

02:09:41.840 --> 02:09:42.840
We'll see what we can do.

02:09:42.840 --> 02:09:47.700
Because I have a certain person I would like to send that to that, you know, is certain

02:09:47.700 --> 02:09:51.560
on certain street dates, and I would like to forward that to them, and that would be

02:09:51.560 --> 02:09:52.560
hilarious.

02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.560
All right.

02:09:53.560 --> 02:09:59.400
We're going to get into the cage match, but we can't figure out where Loki's song went.

02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:01.400
Do you have a new song for us?

02:10:01.400 --> 02:10:02.400
From my cage match?

02:10:02.400 --> 02:10:03.400
Yeah.

02:10:03.400 --> 02:10:04.400
Yeah, I have a new one.

02:10:04.400 --> 02:10:05.400
I didn't even realize it one last time.

02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:08.400
Technically, your song, whatever it was, should have been retired.

02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.400
Yeah, I have a new song that I'm picking.

02:10:10.400 --> 02:10:11.400
Alright, good.

02:10:11.400 --> 02:10:12.400
It's on one of those CDs, actually.

02:10:12.400 --> 02:10:13.400
Oh, good.

02:10:13.400 --> 02:10:14.400
Which one?

02:10:14.400 --> 02:10:15.400
This is great radio, by the way.

02:10:15.400 --> 02:10:16.400
It was a good, cool one.

02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:19.400
Oh, the one that should be already in there.

02:10:19.400 --> 02:10:20.400
Alrighty.

02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:22.400
It's actually on both of them, so it doesn't really matter.

02:10:22.400 --> 02:10:23.400
Okay, sounds good.

02:10:23.400 --> 02:10:26.400
Alright, we're going to get into tonight's cage match, boys and girls.

02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:30.400
We're starting fresh this week because we did go two weeks without a show.

02:10:30.400 --> 02:10:34.400
So we're just going to go ahead and kind of restart tonight with the cage match.

02:10:34.400 --> 02:10:38.400
And it goes a little something like this.

02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:42.400
All right.

02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.400
Here's the deal. Join our chat room,

02:10:46.400 --> 02:10:50.400
www.orangelaungeradio.com. We're going to play three songs for you guys.

02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:54.400
And you guys get to pick your favorite. And the winning song goes into rotation

02:10:54.400 --> 02:10:59.240
All week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bhavani and Video Game Music Show, which plays 24

02:10:59.240 --> 02:11:04.000
hours a day, seven days a week on this station when we are not live.

02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:07.220
So we're going to start off with three brand new songs tonight for you to pick from.

02:11:07.220 --> 02:11:09.400
There is no reigning champion.

02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:13.160
We'll start off tonight with Dark Sakura's pick, since she's the only one that has her

02:11:13.160 --> 02:11:14.160
pick up and ready to go.

02:11:14.160 --> 02:11:16.160
So we're going to start off with her.

02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:17.800
I had it already last week.

02:11:17.800 --> 02:11:19.720
But you know, we won't talk about last week.

02:11:19.720 --> 02:11:21.560
So what did you pick for us, Dark Sakura?

02:11:21.560 --> 02:11:33.560
Um, it's by a Czech group called Aksent, sorry, and this is a really weird video with a look-alike like Kylie Minogue in it, and these guys kept making out with her, and it's called Kylie.

02:11:33.560 --> 02:11:36.560
Interesting. So it's like a Kylie Minogue worship song?

02:11:36.560 --> 02:11:37.560
Yeah.

02:11:37.560 --> 02:11:38.560
This should be pretty rad.

02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:40.560
Actually, this is the English version.

02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:41.560
Alright.

02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:48.560
I haven't listened to it all below through yet, but I listened to the Czech version, and I didn't shoot any of it, so here you go.

02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:49.560
Alright.

02:11:49.560 --> 02:11:53.560
Here we go, song number one tonight, Accents with Kylie.

02:12:19.560 --> 02:12:47.960
Maybe you're the one that made my heart I swear I'm not lying

02:12:47.960 --> 02:12:52.960
Maybe, tonight I'm gonna try my luck

02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:55.960
I can see that you want me

02:12:55.960 --> 02:13:02.960
I'm dreaming about you every night, every night

02:13:02.960 --> 02:13:06.960
Fighting gives me just a chance, let's go out and dance

02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:10.960
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:14.960
Later you can sing to me, like a shining star

02:13:14.960 --> 02:13:17.960
But I'd rather know you on the backseat of my car

02:13:17.960 --> 02:13:21.960
Try to give me just a chance, let's go out and dance

02:13:21.960 --> 02:13:25.960
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

02:13:25.960 --> 02:13:29.960
Later you can sing to me like a shining star

02:13:29.960 --> 02:13:33.560
I'd rather know you're on the back seat of my car

02:13:51.260 --> 02:13:55.960
Baby, take a minute, check me out

02:13:56.760 --> 02:13:58.760
I see you in the front row

02:13:58.760 --> 02:14:03.760
Baby, I'm the coolest guy in the crowd

02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:06.760
I'm sure you have seen me

02:14:06.760 --> 02:14:13.760
I'm dreaming about you every night, every night

02:14:13.760 --> 02:14:17.760
Skydee give me just a chance, let's go out and dance

02:14:17.760 --> 02:14:21.760
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

02:14:21.760 --> 02:14:25.760
Later you can sing to me like a shining star

02:14:25.760 --> 02:14:29.200
But I'd rather, know you on the back-feet of my car

02:14:29.200 --> 02:14:32.960
Hiding gives me just a chance, let's go out and dance

02:14:32.960 --> 02:14:36.800
We can get into the groove, I can watch you move

02:14:36.800 --> 02:14:40.640
Later you can sing to me, like a shining star

02:14:40.640 --> 02:14:45.200
But I'd rather, know you on the back-feet of my car

02:14:45.200 --> 02:14:49.120
You drive me crazy, you slowly drive me crazy

02:14:49.120 --> 02:14:52.880
Red blooded paper, can't get you off my mind

02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:56.380
I used to be lucky, I used to be so lucky

02:14:56.380 --> 02:15:00.380
I used to be lucky to sleep with you tonight

02:15:00.380 --> 02:15:26.780
Let's go out and dance We can get into the groove

02:15:26.780 --> 02:15:28.380
I can watch you move

02:15:28.480 --> 02:15:30.480
Later you can sing to me

02:15:30.580 --> 02:15:32.380
Like a shining star

02:15:32.480 --> 02:15:34.280
But I rather

02:15:34.380 --> 02:15:44.900
Know you're on the back

02:15:44.980 --> 02:15:47.780
I rather

02:15:47.880 --> 02:15:49.420
But I rather

02:15:49.500 --> 02:15:50.420
Know you're on the back

02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:52.420
Take off my car

02:15:52.420 --> 02:16:07.660
Alright though, song number one in tonight's cage match, Accent with Kylie. Let's go around

02:16:07.660 --> 02:16:10.740
and see what everybody thought of that one, starting off with Dark Sakura.

02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:15.780
That song is great. I mean, the style's kind of, you know, an older style, but the song's

02:16:15.780 --> 02:16:21.060
relatively new, and the video's freaking hilarious, so it gets a 9.5.

02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:49.660
I have to agree with Arcadian42 in our chatroom who said this song is fruity. However, for

02:16:49.660 --> 02:16:53.460
For that reason, I loved it. It was great. It was a great cage match song, honestly.

02:16:53.460 --> 02:16:55.460
It was funny and it was dancey. Nine and a half.

02:16:55.460 --> 02:16:57.460
I'm putting the video in the chatroom, by the way.

02:16:57.460 --> 02:17:01.460
Alright. But, there are still two more songs to go. Who knows?

02:17:01.460 --> 02:17:04.460
We may have something a little better. We won't find out. It's your call.

02:17:04.460 --> 02:17:07.060
Song number two is Loki's pick. What'd you pick for us, Loki?

02:17:07.060 --> 02:17:11.860
Some off the Good Cool Xpander CD. I don't really like Eurobeat.

02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:17.860
And this is a trance remix of Blame. So, by Good Cool.

02:17:17.860 --> 02:17:22.860
Alright, here it is. Blame the trance mix by Good Cool.

02:17:47.860 --> 02:17:55.860
will last, deep within my mind I will always find you, you should still remain

02:17:55.860 --> 02:18:02.860
All my heart still yearns to testify still, but I can't put up the blame

02:18:02.860 --> 02:18:07.860
I would never ever do to leave me with a mental wound

02:18:07.860 --> 02:18:14.860
To love the reason why I can't forgive and forgive

02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:17.860
You have left me sad for life,

02:18:17.860 --> 02:18:20.860
Your fear to wake up like a night.

02:18:20.860 --> 02:18:27.860
I can't forgive and forget.

02:18:38.860 --> 02:18:40.860
I thought I would heal,

02:18:40.860 --> 02:18:45.660
But I only feel my conscience reminisce

02:18:45.660 --> 02:18:48.560
I knew that I would fall for you

02:18:48.560 --> 02:18:51.660
But nothing's quite like this

02:18:51.660 --> 02:18:54.860
Why can't I hide what's deep inside?

02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:58.260
The feelings never fade

02:18:58.260 --> 02:19:00.960
Look and see what you've done to me

02:19:00.960 --> 02:19:04.660
The impact that you've made

02:19:04.660 --> 02:19:08.360
I would never have assumed you'd need me

02:19:08.360 --> 02:19:16.880
With a mental wound, still love the reason why I kept on giving for days

02:19:16.880 --> 02:19:23.280
You have left me sad for life, come sit and wake up like a night

02:19:23.280 --> 02:19:29.280
I can't forgive it for you

02:19:53.280 --> 02:20:06.280
Keep me in my mind, I will always find emotions still remain

02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:13.280
Oh, my heart's too young to get the vibe still, but I can't put up the blame

02:20:13.280 --> 02:20:18.480
I would never, ever assume to leave me with a mental wound

02:20:18.480 --> 02:20:24.880
You never will realize why I can't forgive and forget

02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:31.280
You never did not look like something you would not like to see

02:20:31.280 --> 02:20:37.680
I can't forgive and forget

02:20:37.680 --> 02:20:43.280
I would never have assumed you'd leave me with a mental wound

02:20:43.280 --> 02:20:49.280
You know the reason why I can't forgive and forget

02:20:49.880 --> 02:20:52.580
You have left me bad for life

02:20:52.580 --> 02:20:56.180
Consider what God's like at night

02:20:56.180 --> 02:21:02.680
I can't forgive and forget

02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:30.680
You've only got yourself to blame.

02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:35.680
...

02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:40.680
...

02:21:40.680 --> 02:21:45.680
...

02:21:45.680 --> 02:21:50.680
...

02:21:50.680 --> 02:21:55.680
...

02:21:55.680 --> 02:22:25.560
Alrighty, that was song number two of Good Cool with Chorus K featuring Jeff Koot.

02:22:25.560 --> 02:22:29.560
Blame, a trance remix. Interesting. Let's see, Dark Sakura.

02:22:29.560 --> 02:22:35.560
So it sounded like Eurobeat with extra, different, Eurobeat with different synths.

02:22:35.560 --> 02:22:41.560
So, yeah, it was okay, because I really like Blame, but I actually like the Eurobeat version better.

02:22:41.560 --> 02:22:44.560
So it gets a seven and a half.

02:22:44.560 --> 02:22:45.560
Loki.

02:22:45.560 --> 02:22:50.560
It's a nine, because I've been blasting this in my car with the windows down, driving. It's fun.

02:22:50.560 --> 02:23:00.560
I didn't like it as much as the Kylie song, but I kinda dug it. It was pretty cool. I'll give it an 8.5.

02:23:20.560 --> 02:23:26.160
which didn't get a single vote from any of you so I said f you all the next cage

02:23:26.160 --> 02:23:34.120
match I'm gonna play some shitty so here it is the band is m3 Halina Walsh and

02:23:34.120 --> 02:23:39.200
Stacey D I have no idea what kind of name that is but it's m3 Halina Walsh

02:23:39.200 --> 02:23:45.440
and Stacey D it's called I touch myself the love to infinity radio mix and yes

02:23:45.440 --> 02:23:51.080
it is an update of that song. Song number three.

02:24:15.440 --> 02:24:22.440
I want you to find me, I'll forget myself I want you to remind me

02:24:22.440 --> 02:24:29.440
I don't want anybody else When I think about you, I'll touch myself

02:24:29.440 --> 02:24:36.440
I don't want anybody else I don't want anybody else

02:25:06.440 --> 02:25:13.440
You're the sun who makes me shine When you're around, I'm always laughing

02:25:13.440 --> 02:25:20.440
I wanna make you mine I close my eyes and see you before me

02:25:20.440 --> 02:25:28.440
Think I would die if you were to ignore me If I could see just how much I adore you

02:25:28.440 --> 02:25:32.440
I can tell you my needs, I'd do anything for you

02:25:32.440 --> 02:25:36.060
I don't want anybody else

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:39.420
When I think about you, I next myself

02:25:39.420 --> 02:25:44.280
Whoa I don't want anybody else

02:25:44.280 --> 02:25:46.700
Oh no, oh no yeah

02:25:46.700 --> 02:25:49.040
I'll touch my left hand

02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:52.680
Anybody, I'll touch my left hand

02:25:52.680 --> 02:25:56.580
Yeah anybody, I'll touch my left hand

02:25:56.580 --> 02:25:59.960
Yeah, anybody, I touch my left hand

02:25:59.960 --> 02:26:01.960
Anybody else?

02:26:08.960 --> 02:26:10.960
I love myself

02:26:10.960 --> 02:26:12.960
I want you to love me

02:26:12.960 --> 02:26:13.960
When I feel down

02:26:13.960 --> 02:26:15.960
I want you to overburden me

02:26:15.960 --> 02:26:17.960
I search myself

02:26:17.960 --> 02:26:19.960
I want you to find me

02:26:19.960 --> 02:26:21.960
I forget myself

02:26:21.960 --> 02:26:23.960
I want you to remind me

02:26:25.960 --> 02:26:26.960
I want you

02:26:26.960 --> 02:26:28.960
I don'tbODY ELSE

02:26:28.960 --> 02:26:30.960
When I think about you

02:26:30.960 --> 02:26:32.960
I touch myself

02:26:32.960 --> 02:26:36.960
Oooooh

02:26:36.960 --> 02:26:41.960
I don't want anybody else

02:26:41.960 --> 02:26:43.960
When I think about you

02:26:43.960 --> 02:26:45.960
I touch myself

02:26:45.960 --> 02:26:49.960
I don't want anybody else

02:26:49.960 --> 02:26:51.960
I don't, Oh no

02:26:51.960 --> 02:26:53.960
I touch myself

02:27:23.960 --> 02:27:32.960
Alrighty. That was song number three in tonight's cage match. Where's my background? There we go.

02:27:32.960 --> 02:27:39.960
Song number three in tonight's cage match, I Touched Myself by M3, Helena Walsh, and Stacey D.

02:27:39.960 --> 02:27:41.960
I touched myself right in the eye.

02:27:41.960 --> 02:27:43.960
Dark Sakura, what did you think?

02:27:43.960 --> 02:27:53.960
I wanted to cry, because they took a song that was excellent in its original form, and made it into just generic trance crap. So it gets a 3.

02:27:53.960 --> 02:27:55.960
Loki!

02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:01.960
It's remix by numbers. Take song, add different backbeat, done.

02:28:01.960 --> 02:28:05.960
Uh, I didn't like it. It made me feel-

02:28:05.960 --> 02:28:14.960
It was like that song was the whole, and seven days later I'm going to become gay having listened to that song, so I can't get to six.

02:28:14.960 --> 02:28:16.960
Bugged.

02:28:16.960 --> 02:28:22.960
Yeah, I touch myself in the eye and then the nose, and yeah. Two.

02:28:22.960 --> 02:28:28.960
That's the kind of song I would clean house while dancing around in my underwear, too. I give it a seven.

02:28:28.960 --> 02:28:31.960
I do not need that imagery!

02:28:31.960 --> 02:28:36.960
And yes you're welcome for that special imagery brought to you by me.

02:28:36.960 --> 02:28:40.440
Let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

02:28:40.440 --> 02:28:53.200
Song number one is Accent with Kylie.

02:28:53.200 --> 02:28:57.480

We have to play this song now. What song is this?

02:29:35.840 --> 02:29:36.840
The V-Rare stuff.

02:29:36.840 --> 02:29:38.840
Oh, we'll get to the V-Rare.

02:29:38.840 --> 02:29:41.880
That's because I found that song that I was talking to you about. Remember when we were

02:29:41.880 --> 02:29:45.440
sitting at E3 and we were watching, you know, the Groovilooz do their thing up there in

02:29:45.440 --> 02:29:50.440
that song? I'm like, that would be an awesome song to remix with No Limit. Well, that was

02:29:50.440 --> 02:29:52.200
the You Gotta Move It song.

02:29:52.200 --> 02:29:53.200
Really? It was?

02:29:53.200 --> 02:29:56.760
That it wasn't menu music. That was that new song. We are okay

02:29:56.760 --> 02:29:59.600
We are gonna get to the v-ware actually very soon here very soon

02:29:59.600 --> 02:30:03.120
I do I don't want to go to a break just yet though

02:30:03.120 --> 02:30:05.960
I want to like folks have a chance to submit in their cage match votes

02:30:07.400 --> 02:30:11.360
Loki after the cage matches usually when we talk about what's going on in the sim scene a

02:30:12.240 --> 02:30:16.320
Lot of waiting is what's going on in the sim scene. We're waiting for a few things

02:30:16.320 --> 02:30:19.120
We're waiting for my sale to come back up. We're waiting for

02:30:35.160 --> 02:30:41.880
what's going on with was a DDR East Coast invasion because they're still

02:30:41.880 --> 02:30:48.600
doing tournaments or tournaments six and I know they were up through bracket to

02:30:48.600 --> 02:30:53.280
I got to play some of the songs and I have to say I'm glad they're they're done

02:30:53.920 --> 02:30:57.500
Glad they're done doing these because it hasn't gotten any better at all

02:30:58.200 --> 02:31:01.920
so now they're doing I guess attorney makes six wild card around and

02:31:02.560 --> 02:31:08.060
What the hell that means? I don't know but it's gonna be done folks. So you're suffering will be over soon and

02:31:09.320 --> 02:31:15.920
Yeah, that's pretty much it. We're just waiting lots of waiting but food mix tues coming soon. That's all you need to know

02:31:15.920 --> 02:31:25.920
Tell the folks listening about that video game we were playing before the show tonight because that was an interesting little game.

02:31:25.920 --> 02:31:29.920
A lot of DDR fans are also Konami fans, so they might get a kick out of this one.

02:31:29.920 --> 02:31:42.920
This was actually put out by Hudson Soft. This game, I'm assuming, came after Super Smash Brothers, but this is basically as close to Super Smash Brothers as you're going to get on the PlayStation 2.

02:31:42.920 --> 02:31:50.800
2. It's an import only title and it's called Dream TV, like Dream Mix TV or something like

02:31:50.800 --> 02:31:58.800
that, World Fighters. And what it is, it's a collection of characters from Konami, from

02:31:58.800 --> 02:32:04.800
I want to say Hudson Soft and one other company. I can't remember the last company, but it

02:32:04.800 --> 02:32:10.120
is Super Smash Brothers with us. So, you get some really crazy match ups from Konami. For

02:32:10.120 --> 02:32:15.400
For example, starting off they have Simon Belmont, they have, um, Solid Snake, that

02:32:15.400 --> 02:32:21.320
was unlockable, Solid Snake, um, they have Twinbee, they have, um, this guy from Konami

02:32:21.320 --> 02:32:27.480
Baseball or something like that, and then some other stuff, um, then they have, for,

02:32:27.480 --> 02:32:35.360
was it Hudson, they had, um, I forget, Bomberman, they had, um, you know, just FYI, Jamie just

02:32:35.360 --> 02:32:38.360
I just yelled that from the bathroom.

02:32:38.360 --> 02:32:44.360
Okay, so they have Bomberman. They had like some Barbie type chick or something like that.

02:32:44.360 --> 02:32:47.360
They had, I want to say...

02:32:47.360 --> 02:32:50.360
Optimus Prime, bitch! Optimus Prime, motherfucker!

02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.360
Bomberman!

02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:55.360
Bomberman was in it. Have you played this game? Dark Sakura? Have you played this game?

02:32:55.360 --> 02:32:58.360
Goddamn, all I heard was Hudson's off and I think Bomberman.

02:32:58.360 --> 02:33:04.360
A Super Smash Brothers ripoff, well, clone-ish game with Konami characters and Hudson characters and Optimus Prime.

02:33:04.360 --> 02:33:05.360
Optimus Prime.

02:33:05.360 --> 02:33:06.360
On what?

02:33:06.360 --> 02:33:07.360
PlayStation 2.

02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:08.360
PlayStation 2 Japanese.

02:33:08.360 --> 02:33:09.360
Is it out?

02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:10.360
When?

02:33:10.360 --> 02:33:11.360
It's already out.

02:33:11.360 --> 02:33:12.360
Ordering right now.

02:33:12.360 --> 02:33:13.360
I have it on my PlayStation.

02:33:13.360 --> 02:33:14.360
You gotta play it.

02:33:14.360 --> 02:33:18.800
We did a matchup with Simon Belmont versus Optimus Prime, who, by the way, turns into

02:33:18.800 --> 02:33:19.800
a truck.

02:33:19.800 --> 02:33:24.560
That was great, watching Optimus Prime turn into a truck and beat people, run people over.

02:33:24.560 --> 02:33:28.100
They have characters from Bloody Roar in it.

02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:29.960
They had one of the characters from that.

02:33:29.960 --> 02:33:30.960
Adventure Island.

02:33:30.960 --> 02:33:31.960
Adventure Island.

02:33:31.960 --> 02:33:32.960
This game is...

02:33:32.960 --> 02:33:33.960
Master Higgins.

02:33:33.960 --> 02:33:37.720
And this game's friggin' awesome! It just, it never came out over here, and...

02:33:37.720 --> 02:33:39.000
It's not as good as Smash Brothers, that's why.

02:33:39.000 --> 02:33:41.720
It's not as good as Smash Brothers, but it's still pretty damn fun.

02:33:41.720 --> 02:33:43.080
I had fun playing it.

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:44.320
But it's very Japanese.

02:33:44.320 --> 02:33:46.320
It's very Japanese.

02:33:46.320 --> 02:33:49.200
So I think it's too much of a culture shock thing.

02:33:49.200 --> 02:33:52.720
But it was really cool, and I hadn't... I was gonna...

02:33:52.720 --> 02:33:58.200
The first time I played through it with Simon Belmont, and then I was gonna play it through it with Optimus Prime.

02:33:58.200 --> 02:34:03.960
and we have to do the show, but Optimus Prime was funny running in the people of the truck

02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:06.600
yeah it was really funny they were playing this and I was sitting there

02:34:06.600 --> 02:34:12.920
playing Burnout Legends and all of a sudden Rob goes, oh shoot, we've got to start the show in like three minutes

02:34:12.920 --> 02:34:14.060
alright

02:34:14.060 --> 02:34:15.840
and then it was, where's Jamie?

02:34:15.840 --> 02:34:22.840
I'm sorry, I was in the bathroom, thank you. No, not now, before the show, and then I walked back here and then suddenly the front door opened

02:34:22.840 --> 02:34:23.760
oh, speak

02:34:23.760 --> 02:34:26.800
speak of the devil, literally

02:34:26.800 --> 02:34:29.920
Alright, I was there too before I came here.

02:34:29.920 --> 02:34:33.260
Alright, we're going to tally up those cage match votes right now and we're going to take

02:34:33.260 --> 02:34:34.260
a break.

02:34:34.260 --> 02:34:38.920
In this break, DDR Extreme 2 V-Rare music.

02:34:38.920 --> 02:34:39.920
We got it.

02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.920
Here it is.

02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:46.960
We're going to hear in this break some of the shorter songs from, was that NCSX sold

02:34:46.960 --> 02:34:47.960
out of Mario Mix?

02:34:47.960 --> 02:34:50.960
Yeah, DDR Mario Mix sold out on NCSX.

02:34:50.960 --> 02:34:51.960
Alright.

02:34:51.960 --> 02:34:52.960
Diet Channel.

02:34:52.960 --> 02:34:54.680
Here we go.

02:34:54.680 --> 02:34:57.640
to hear in this break because we picked some of the shorter songs because we're not going to be

02:34:57.640 --> 02:35:02.280
able to play the whole thing you gotta move it which is the new song that's going to be playable

02:35:02.280 --> 02:35:10.280

02:35:10.280 --> 02:35:17.280
all in this break. We'll be back. Enjoy.

02:36:10.280 --> 02:36:12.280
Yeah

02:36:12.280 --> 02:36:14.280
Yeah

02:36:14.280 --> 02:36:16.280
Yeah

02:36:16.280 --> 02:36:18.280
Oh, yeah

02:36:18.280 --> 02:36:20.280
Yeah, yeah

02:36:20.280 --> 02:36:22.280
Yeah

02:36:22.280 --> 02:36:24.280
Yeah

02:36:24.280 --> 02:36:26.280
Oh, yeah

02:36:26.280 --> 02:36:28.280
Oh, yeah

02:36:28.280 --> 02:36:30.280
Yeah

02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:32.280
You gotta know

02:36:32.280 --> 02:36:52.280
Listen, take control of yourself, let your body take control

02:37:02.280 --> 02:37:08.280
Falling, my whole world is falling

02:37:08.280 --> 02:37:15.280
Without you in my life, so hard to keep from dying

02:37:15.280 --> 02:37:19.280
When your eyes meet mine, everything seems fine

02:37:19.280 --> 02:37:23.280
Always making love with you

02:37:23.280 --> 02:37:26.280
Fear that you'll love me, always be with me

02:37:26.280 --> 02:37:30.280
Forever and ever

02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:38.280
But on that day when I awoke and I found I walk alone

02:37:38.280 --> 02:37:43.280
I just feel deep down in my heart no more

02:37:45.280 --> 02:37:51.280
You are my destiny, that's how it's supposed to be

02:37:51.280 --> 02:37:56.280
That's the way it's really meant to be

02:37:56.280 --> 02:38:00.280
I knew I'd defend to set you free

02:38:07.280 --> 02:38:12.280
I could keep on following you, never letting you go

02:38:12.280 --> 02:38:16.280
Following you, losing all my fight

02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:19.280
Going on you, never letting you go

02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:22.280
Following you, but you'd run

02:38:22.280 --> 02:38:32.280
You, you were my destiny I was planning for eternity

02:38:32.280 --> 02:38:42.280
Something came and took away from me Baby, you, you were my destiny

02:38:42.280 --> 02:38:48.280
You were the only man in this world for me, meant for me

02:38:48.280 --> 02:38:52.780
But now you've run away, dear, to me

02:40:48.280 --> 02:40:48.780
Ta-da!

02:42:48.280 --> 02:43:03.160
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us, Orange Lounge

02:43:03.160 --> 02:43:06.160
Radio.

02:43:06.160 --> 02:43:12.640
Hello boys and girls, welcome back to Orange Lounge Radio, I almost want to call that Target

02:43:12.640 --> 02:43:16.200
store back tomorrow morning and see if that copy got sold or somebody went and slapped

02:43:16.200 --> 02:43:21.200
them on the wrist or what we'll see it's out there now anyway in that break some

02:43:21.200 --> 02:43:26.160
music from the DDR extreme 2 v-rare you got to move it featuring Julie regard I

02:43:26.160 --> 02:43:30.560
think it is destiny piano version I need you inside outdoor mix and infinite

02:43:30.560 --> 02:43:34.560
prayer all from the new v-rare which by the way I tried to get at a GameStop

02:43:34.560 --> 02:43:37.360
yesterday or I should really say Miklotov tried to get at a GameStop yesterday

02:43:37.360 --> 02:43:40.440
which I don't really get cuz you know he kind of works for Konami and he doesn't

02:43:40.440 --> 02:43:44.040
have a copy of the v-rare yet but we were trying to I get one from GameStop

02:43:44.040 --> 02:43:49.120
and couldn't get one. Um, this is the weird thing though. Behind the counter. If I haven't

02:43:49.120 --> 02:43:52.740
gotten one yet. No, this is the weird thing. They said they had given some out, but they

02:43:52.740 --> 02:43:57.660
thought they had one left. They had the cover and no disc in it. Like somebody had taken

02:43:57.660 --> 02:44:01.380
the disc without the cover. They have them at the one that I know that's over on Madison

02:44:01.380 --> 02:44:05.880
and Hazel over there. Really? They had a stack of them when I went there. Folks in chat room

02:44:05.880 --> 02:44:09.880
are saying they're getting it now, so. I thought you had to pre-order it though to get one.

02:44:09.880 --> 02:44:12.880
Well, not if you know the right people.

02:44:12.880 --> 02:44:17.880
Anyway, so there was some tracks in there for you guys who didn't pre-order the game

02:44:17.880 --> 02:44:21.880
or just wanted to hear it, haven't gotten your vrares yet.

02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:25.880
Those were some of the tracks. Other tracks, some repeats from previous games

02:44:25.880 --> 02:44:27.880
you've probably already heard before on the station.

02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:30.880
Some other long version mixes, but we just don't have time to play those

02:44:30.880 --> 02:44:33.880
because they're like seven or eight minutes, so maybe later on.

02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:38.880
We can play the Seduction vocal mix, it's only 4.40.

02:44:38.880 --> 02:44:55.880
Eh, maybe we'll get to that if we have time, but we're running a little late in show, actually, because usually we get to the FUs of the week around 8.30, and frickin' now it's 9.15, and we still haven't gotten to the FUs of the week, so I think we better do that, or we're gonna be in trouble.

02:44:55.880 --> 02:44:58.880
Right, DarkSakurai? Because this is your little baby, after all.

02:44:58.880 --> 02:45:03.880
So why is it, then, that we have to do the FUs of the week every single freaking week, like it or not?

02:45:03.880 --> 02:45:20.880
My first FU of the week goes toward sleeping for 12 hours and waking up sick.

02:45:20.880 --> 02:45:25.480
Also another FU goes to battle tech because it makes me motion sick.

02:45:25.480 --> 02:45:30.560
Another FU goes toward...

02:45:30.560 --> 02:45:34.300
I actually have something I can't say on the air, so just a generic F.U. towards something

02:45:34.300 --> 02:45:40.700
that's stuck in my head. And, um, another one goes toward being sick again, and having

02:45:40.700 --> 02:45:44.220
to go to work. That's it.

02:45:44.220 --> 02:45:45.420
Alright, Loki's turn.

02:45:45.420 --> 02:45:46.420
Oh yeah, one more.

02:45:46.420 --> 02:45:47.420
Oh.

02:45:47.420 --> 02:45:49.780
F.U. to world geography. Thank you.

02:45:49.780 --> 02:45:56.300
Alright, let's go to Loki. I have one that's stuck in my mind, and that's basically, fuck

02:45:56.300 --> 02:46:08.300
Thank you to the firewall that's at my work, because now I can't view a lot of sites because they're, you know, under different, like, logs, you know, like, spam or chat or whatever.

02:46:08.300 --> 02:46:12.300
At one point we had, like, almost the whole internet blocked because they were messing with the filters.

02:46:12.300 --> 02:46:13.300
Do you guys use Websense?

02:46:13.300 --> 02:46:19.300
No, they have this Barracuda, uh, spy blocker thing, or Barracuda firewall or something.

02:46:19.300 --> 02:46:25.300
That sucker, you know, it doesn't like proxy servers either, I tried getting around it that way, but, uh, no luck.

02:46:25.300 --> 02:46:31.300
Anyways, um, yeah, but fuck that, because now I can't read stuff on LiveJournal and it cuts down one more page I can read.

02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:34.300
Welcome to the world where the rest of us have to live and at work.

02:46:34.300 --> 02:46:36.300
That's okay, I have my ways around things.

02:46:36.300 --> 02:46:44.300
Um, anyways, so, that sucks, but, um, other than that, really, um, not too much else that I'm mad at, other than just not having enough time.

02:46:44.300 --> 02:46:50.300
We need, like, 28-hour days or something, so I have more time to get stuff done.

02:46:50.300 --> 02:46:54.300
And, uh, yeah, that's pretty much it.

02:46:54.300 --> 02:47:07.300
I'm going to give an F.U. to Vacation being over, because I want it to end.

02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:12.300
So an F.U. to the fact that Vacation is running out and I actually have to go back to work tomorrow, that sucks.

02:47:12.300 --> 02:47:17.300
And an F.U. to GameStop that didn't have the copy of the beer area in yesterday, because I wanted that.

02:47:17.300 --> 02:47:23.300
FU to the fact that the systems that Dave & Busters went down for a little while yesterday, which took away from my precious playtime.

02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:30.300
FU to the fact that I can't stop eating Cold Stone, because that ice cream is delicious, and it makes me fat.

02:47:30.300 --> 02:47:36.300
And an FU to that guy in Final Fantasy XI who called me a cheap white mage because I don't have a race.

02:47:36.300 --> 02:47:41.300
Fuck you, I've tried to do BCNM 40 I don't know how many times, I can't get that damn scroll. I can't win it for my life.

02:47:41.300 --> 02:47:44.300
So, F.U. I hate you. No cures for you.

02:47:45.300 --> 02:47:48.300
I like being a white mage because if I don't like somebody I'll let them die.

02:47:49.300 --> 02:47:51.300
Oops, I'm sorry lag.

02:47:52.300 --> 02:47:55.300
Let's go to Bugz with any F.Us he might have.

02:47:56.300 --> 02:47:58.300
F.U. to your Comcast DVR.

02:47:59.300 --> 02:48:00.300
Why?

02:48:00.300 --> 02:48:02.300
It doesn't work like a TiVo.

02:48:02.300 --> 02:48:04.300
I told you it's not as good as TiVo.

02:48:04.300 --> 02:48:05.300
Good God.

02:48:05.300 --> 02:48:09.780
I thought you meant it didn't record suggestions. I didn't know it wouldn't go back

02:48:11.080 --> 02:48:14.820
Well, and also since I haven't been on the show in a while if you do breaking my collarbone

02:48:17.180 --> 02:48:19.180
Glad to see you up and about

02:48:19.220 --> 02:48:19.860
Yes

02:48:19.860 --> 02:48:25.080
Rob saw me when a couple of days afterward at a party and I pretty much sat in the chair and

02:48:25.380 --> 02:48:27.820
vegged out drank a lot of beer and

02:48:29.060 --> 02:48:33.460
We all laughed at pictures of ourselves from junior high in high school. No, mostly just mine

02:48:33.460 --> 02:48:38.460
And Brian's, but that's because he wasn't there.

02:48:38.460 --> 02:48:40.460
Let's see, uh...

02:48:40.460 --> 02:48:43.460
Oh, FQ did the ER, but...

02:48:43.460 --> 02:48:45.460
Because when I broke my collarbone, I had to go to ER.

02:48:45.460 --> 02:48:49.460
I'm unemployed, I do not have insurance, and it was actually a lot less than I thought it would be,

02:48:49.460 --> 02:48:52.460
but the fact that I didn't have insurance sucked.

02:48:52.460 --> 02:48:56.460
Next time I fall and break my collarbone, I'm going to try and do it in Canada.

02:48:56.460 --> 02:48:57.460
Yep.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:48:59.460
Yeah, I'm going to plan on that.

02:48:59.460 --> 02:49:02.460
Put it on the itinerary for next time I go for Vancouver.

02:49:02.460 --> 02:49:05.460
Follow the off-bike brake collarbone.

02:49:05.460 --> 02:49:07.460
Uh...

02:49:07.460 --> 02:49:09.460
Not many other FUs.

02:49:09.460 --> 02:49:11.460
Alright.

02:49:11.460 --> 02:49:15.460
Wow, that music was too happy for an FU. I'm sorry.

02:49:15.460 --> 02:49:17.460
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo.

02:49:17.460 --> 02:49:19.460
Chat room FU time.

02:49:19.460 --> 02:49:25.460
Sakarina says FU to rain to public transportation that isn't on time, trains and all that happening on the same day,

02:49:25.460 --> 02:49:29.300
day, causing me to walk home from school in the rain, and staying stuck there due to a

02:49:29.300 --> 02:49:38.300
train crossing. Tomokun would like to say fuck Live 365, fuck, fuck, fuck idiots.

02:49:38.300 --> 02:49:42.700
Darkknight would like to say my F.U. goes to my Advance Wars DS game for being hard

02:49:42.700 --> 02:49:46.780
as hell, and an F.U. to loneliness, no one in the world deserves to be all alone in the

02:49:46.780 --> 02:49:51.560
world. SpiritSnare says F.U. to Tokyo Game Action

02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:56.200
for getting Happy Sky, FU to certain Target stores for releasing We Heart Katamari earlier

02:49:56.200 --> 02:50:03.640
than they're supposed to, FU to others for not, not Google but Goggle, says FU to Lowe's

02:50:03.640 --> 02:50:08.480
Cineplex in Danbury, Connecticut for not letting me into an R-rated movie, also FU to schools

02:50:08.480 --> 02:50:14.800
starting at 7.45 every morning, I think I've been to that theater in Connecticut, go figure,

02:50:14.800 --> 02:50:19.520
I've been to a lot of really random places, Dark Tetsuya says the continued FU to this

02:50:19.520 --> 02:50:24.040
crappy connection. And the F.U. to CCL's card system. No one explained that the cards expire,

02:50:24.040 --> 02:50:29.560
so I had to find out the hard way. Yeah, I read that in your L.J. and I was pissed too.

02:50:29.560 --> 02:50:36.560
Rene would like to say, I have an F.U. to diarrhea or indigestion. You know, in the

02:50:36.640 --> 02:50:42.320
hundred and fifty-five episodes we've done of Orange Lounge Radio, you think that's something

02:50:42.320 --> 02:50:48.600
someone would have said F.U. to a long time ago because, what? You didn't flat out say

02:50:48.600 --> 02:50:54.640
say diarrhea. You did say indigestion, but... No, F you to the medication the doctor puts

02:50:54.640 --> 02:51:01.640
you on. I have done an F you though to drinking a lot of Hawaiian Punch and coloring my feces

02:51:02.880 --> 02:51:09.880
blue. So I think that kind of tops that one. If you eat asparagus it turns your pee a different

02:51:10.320 --> 02:51:16.560
color too. If you have honey smacks it makes your pee smell like honey smacks, did you

02:51:16.560 --> 02:51:18.560
That sounds incredibly nasty.

02:51:18.560 --> 02:51:20.560
It's incredible.

02:51:20.560 --> 02:51:22.560
First off, why are you sniffing your pee?

02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:24.560
It doesn't...

02:51:24.560 --> 02:51:26.560
That stuff is so strong.

02:51:26.560 --> 02:51:28.560
It's the aroma that wafts up from the toilet.

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:30.560
Exactly. It's like, honey smacks.

02:51:30.560 --> 02:51:32.560
Rubs red. Look, rubs red.

02:51:32.560 --> 02:51:36.560
I just can't... I can't believe this show has literally gone into the toilet.

02:51:36.560 --> 02:51:39.560
Hey, we can't make poo-poo jokes anymore, so...

02:51:39.560 --> 02:51:45.560
So much to compile a website of all the different foods that will make your, like, you know, bile and...

02:51:45.560 --> 02:51:48.260
Your one and two smell like something else I

02:51:49.040 --> 02:51:54.560
Can imagine some of our listeners are now gonna go really and like drink a whole gallon of blue

02:51:54.560 --> 02:51:57.880
Why don't wine punch that she is awesome, but they don't sell it anymore

02:51:58.080 --> 02:52:02.040
They don't sell the blue stuff. They sell green and like orange and stuff

02:52:02.040 --> 02:52:08.440
So and red and I don't you know want drink a gallon of red. I like the blue stuff and they don't sell it

02:52:08.440 --> 02:52:09.760
That sucks

02:52:09.760 --> 02:52:10.760
Moving on.

02:52:10.760 --> 02:52:15.760
F you to everybody because I have a Sega CDX and no one else.

02:52:15.760 --> 02:52:17.760
Sega CDX?

02:52:17.760 --> 02:52:18.760
Huh?

02:52:18.760 --> 02:52:23.760
Rene is saying an F you to everybody because he has a CDX and nobody else does, but you

02:52:23.760 --> 02:52:25.760
have one, don't you?

02:52:25.760 --> 02:52:26.760
Yeah.

02:52:26.760 --> 02:52:28.760
Actually, I have a regular CDX.

02:52:28.760 --> 02:52:29.760
I have both.

02:52:29.760 --> 02:52:30.760
I have all three, I think.

02:52:30.760 --> 02:52:34.760
I'm sure you know what sort of context I mean in that last one.

02:52:34.760 --> 02:52:41.720
Zakku would like to say F you to being unemployed for nearly 9 months and F you to not getting

02:52:41.720 --> 02:52:43.360
work study this year.

02:52:43.360 --> 02:52:47.800
F you to not having to wait this long to order my books for school.

02:52:47.800 --> 02:52:52.100
F you to State University of New York University Police for giving us heat for having lots

02:52:52.100 --> 02:52:58.920
of people in the front of our apartment on Friday and Saturday nights.

02:52:58.920 --> 02:53:07.480
SIN or S1N. Fuck you to there not being any retarded Target stores in Canada.

02:53:07.480 --> 02:53:10.720
Are there, is there a Target in Canada? I hope so, are you guys really missing out?

02:53:10.720 --> 02:53:13.680
Okay, there is Target in Canada. And the Walmart doesn't have a star in the

02:53:13.680 --> 02:53:16.080
middle, it has a dash. Who fucking cares?

02:53:16.080 --> 02:53:17.320
I don't know. Alright.

02:53:17.320 --> 02:53:21.720
Well, if you watch shows that are supposedly, like, in the US, and they're actually filmed

02:53:21.720 --> 02:53:26.520
in Canada, you can tell. You got a lot of free time on your hands, don't

02:53:26.520 --> 02:53:36.520
There's a Walmart, is it like a Walmart or Target commercial when it's showing what is out here known as best foods, mayonnaise, it shows actually Hellman's.

02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:47.520
ColorOfSakura says, F you to silly high school drama that I keep getting pulled into because people think I care. Just remember, yeah, it gets better in college.

02:53:47.520 --> 02:53:49.520
There's lots of drinking involved, too.

02:53:49.520 --> 02:53:55.520
Yep. Ron Cham says, F you to the con I'm staffing for. I'm in charge of two departments, and I got no help here. I need a drink.

02:53:55.520 --> 02:54:11.520
John Field says, F you to my sudden loss of interest in Phantasy Star Online. Here I'm trying to pull out a machinima, and I'm finding I can't play the game normally anymore without feeling totally drained. Oh well, it was a good five year run.

02:54:11.520 --> 02:54:13.320
5 year run.

02:54:13.320 --> 02:54:16.800
I've owned that fucking game on like 4 different systems and I never want to play it again.

02:54:16.800 --> 02:54:17.800
Sorry.

02:54:17.800 --> 02:54:19.360
I haven't played it since I got married.

02:54:19.360 --> 02:54:23.840
BakaNiko says F you for not having any targets in the area so I cannot check one.

02:54:23.840 --> 02:54:25.600
I'm sorry, Weheart Katamari.

02:54:25.600 --> 02:54:26.600
Uh, Bob.

02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:27.600
Huh?

02:54:27.600 --> 02:54:28.600
Neko means cat.

02:54:28.600 --> 02:54:29.600
Sorry.

02:54:29.600 --> 02:54:30.600
Blah.

02:54:30.600 --> 02:54:34.960
GS191 says F you to the in the groove for breaking on me.

02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:38.160
F you to Comcast for the cable going out 3 times this week.

02:54:38.160 --> 02:54:40.600
F you to leechers that are not seeding Advent Children.

02:54:40.600 --> 02:54:44.800
F you to politics, Republicans suck and Democrats blow.

02:54:44.800 --> 02:54:50.480
F you to G4 for trying to get tech back, it is too late, and may G4 go down in flames.

02:54:50.480 --> 02:54:52.440
My dad's very happy that Leo Laporte is back on.

02:54:52.440 --> 02:54:54.600
Yes, I am happy Leo Laporte's come back.

02:54:54.600 --> 02:54:57.360
Leo, take him in from the inside, take him out.

02:54:57.360 --> 02:55:00.960
You need to tell him about that live taping of This Week in Tech that's going on in NorCal.

02:55:00.960 --> 02:55:05.320
Yes, there's going to be, there's two podcasts I'll listen to, this one and This Week in

02:55:05.320 --> 02:55:06.320
Tech.

02:55:06.320 --> 02:55:07.840
Technically this right now is not a podcast.

02:55:07.840 --> 02:55:08.840
I know.

02:55:08.840 --> 02:55:09.840
Podcast will be later.

02:55:09.840 --> 02:55:11.840
I know, I know what you mean.

02:55:18.840 --> 02:55:19.840
Where the hell's that?

02:55:19.840 --> 02:55:20.840
North Bay, right?

02:55:20.840 --> 02:55:22.840
Yeah, it's North Bay. It's north of San Francisco.

02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:24.840
I want to go there and just whore out Orange Lounge.

02:55:24.840 --> 02:55:27.840
That's what pretty much my plan was.

02:55:27.840 --> 02:55:28.840
Alright, sounds good.

02:55:28.840 --> 02:55:30.840
jadedangel, we got a couple more here.

02:55:30.840 --> 02:55:31.840
jadedangel says,

02:55:31.840 --> 02:55:35.840
F you to Sony for making the release date of Final Fantasy VII Advent Children be delayed.

02:55:35.840 --> 02:55:37.840
Well, go download it.

02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:38.840
Not that we advocate that.

02:55:38.840 --> 02:55:44.840
Get usenet, folks. No need for seeds on that. It downloads about a hundred times faster.

02:55:44.840 --> 02:55:50.840
Darkknight says, oh, and a final F.U. to Accounting Homework for causing me total brain damage.

02:55:50.840 --> 02:55:55.840
End of line. Oh wait, no, was there one more here?

02:55:55.840 --> 02:56:01.840
Oh, alright, that's it. That's it. That was all the F.Us of the week.

02:56:01.840 --> 02:56:04.840
F.U. to Christopher for not bringing anything for us.

02:56:04.840 --> 02:56:06.840
No, I'm hungry, lookin' at that, ugh.

02:56:06.840 --> 02:56:08.840
That's alright.

02:56:08.840 --> 02:56:09.840
Hi.

02:56:09.840 --> 02:56:10.840
Hello.

02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:11.840
We have four minutes left to show.

02:56:11.840 --> 02:56:14.840
Do you want to give us a quick movie review of what you saw this week?

02:56:14.840 --> 02:56:18.840
Sure, I saw Serenity, which was really, really, really well done.

02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:20.840
I recommend it to everybody.

02:56:20.840 --> 02:56:23.840
FYI, he's a little bit biased because he's a Buffy whore.

02:56:23.840 --> 02:56:25.840
That's okay.

02:56:25.840 --> 02:56:28.840
Dark Soccer, I believe, agrees with me, right?

02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:30.840
I wanted to go, and I couldn't, because that's cool.

02:56:30.840 --> 02:56:32.840
I have something for you, it's a bunch of the nuts.

02:56:32.840 --> 02:56:48.840
I found out the other day, cause this was last week after we did our fake show thing, Christopher was showing us the funny part in that one gay porn.

02:56:48.840 --> 02:56:56.840
And that reminded me of the trailer that was on one of them for The Hole, I guess cause it's a gay porn version of The Ring.

02:56:56.840 --> 02:57:01.040
That's why our company is actually distributing that.

02:57:01.040 --> 02:57:03.040
Which is hilarious.

02:57:03.040 --> 02:57:05.040
Yes.

02:57:05.040 --> 02:57:11.080
You know how a lot of pornos will do funny play on the regular movie title?

02:57:11.080 --> 02:57:12.920
I remember there was a porno once.

02:57:12.920 --> 02:57:13.920
It was Ali McFeel.

02:57:13.920 --> 02:57:14.920
Was it a porno?

02:57:14.920 --> 02:57:15.920
Edward Penisands.

02:57:15.920 --> 02:57:17.920
Yeah, Edward Penisands I've seen.

02:57:17.920 --> 02:57:20.960
I saw the first one I ever saw was the Boneheads.

02:57:20.960 --> 02:57:23.600
Beaver and Buttface is another one I've seen.

02:57:23.600 --> 02:57:26.560
Before you're gay, you see the hole.

02:57:26.560 --> 02:57:29.640
Now they're doing The Ring, except it's the gay version.

02:57:29.640 --> 02:57:31.440
It's totally hot, too.

02:57:31.440 --> 02:57:33.440
I recommend that movie, too.

02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:37.440
Oh, and I saw The Exorcism of Emily Rose, which was okay.

02:57:37.440 --> 02:57:39.280
It was okay?

02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:40.280
Yeah.

02:57:40.280 --> 02:57:41.280
But Serenity was great.

02:57:41.280 --> 02:57:42.280
I recommend that.

02:57:42.280 --> 02:57:43.280
Two thumbs up.

02:57:43.280 --> 02:57:44.880
Two thumbs up and...

02:57:44.880 --> 02:57:47.400
You need to come up with a gay rating system to rate movies.

02:57:47.400 --> 02:57:50.080
Two cocks up.

02:57:50.080 --> 02:57:51.880
I give it two hard dicks up.

02:57:51.880 --> 02:57:52.880
Okay.

02:57:52.880 --> 02:57:53.880
Here's Loki.

02:57:53.880 --> 02:57:55.060
No, no, no.

02:57:55.060 --> 02:58:07.060
two hard dicks up my ass okay yeah well I didn't see it going in that direction

02:58:07.060 --> 02:58:12.740
but anyways we got a late fu you'll like this one Loki spirit snare says fu to

02:58:12.740 --> 02:58:19.900

got we have a couple minutes left here what do you say what do I want to say I

02:58:22.780 --> 02:58:30.460
I want to say that I was reading the other day, so I like to read digs sometimes, and

02:58:30.460 --> 02:58:35.460
there was some funny stuff I was reading on there. I don't know.

02:58:35.460 --> 02:58:41.280
You need to dig our target thing. Yeah. Screw that. I'm, I'm, I am bitching

02:58:41.280 --> 02:58:45.700
to Amco, but what the hell? You can't get us our shit on time, but you can sure as hell

02:58:45.700 --> 02:58:49.180
give it a target? It doesn't know what the hell to do with it? Morons?

02:58:49.180 --> 02:58:52.300
You know, I don't know what's up with that.

02:58:52.300 --> 02:58:57.020
The fact is, what's up with that? I want to know why they aren't sending me free samples.

02:58:57.020 --> 02:58:58.100
That's what I want to know.

02:58:58.100 --> 02:59:02.140
But why aren't you sending me this shit for free? I should be having it already.

02:59:02.140 --> 02:59:06.220
Namco Battle Collection, my ass. You know what?

02:59:06.220 --> 02:59:09.700
I just can't wait for Burnout Revenge. It's coming out next week.

02:59:09.700 --> 02:59:16.140
I love that game. I had to get Burnout Legends to tie me over. It's kind of a

02:59:16.140 --> 02:59:18.660
transitional into Burnout Revenge.

02:59:18.660 --> 02:59:25.660
I'm gonna be playing that for months. Alright, until Liberty Sea Stories comes out.

02:59:25.660 --> 02:59:30.660
Huh? Oh, did we do the Cage Match winners? I don't think we did the Cage Match winners.

02:59:30.660 --> 02:59:33.660
Oh, fucking A. Who did win the Cage Match winners? There's the vote tally.

02:59:33.660 --> 02:59:39.660
Tonight's Cage Match winner was... It was actually very close. All three songs got a lot of votes tonight,

02:59:39.660 --> 02:59:42.660
so everybody should feel really good. But this one won.

02:59:42.660 --> 02:59:50.660
Good, cool. Future and Jeff Koop. Yeah, I'm going to find a song for next week. Woohoo!

02:59:50.660 --> 02:59:55.660
Alright, congratulations there. That was a very close one.

02:59:55.660 --> 02:59:59.660

03:01:07.460 --> 03:01:08.960
Dark Sakura.

03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:11.800
I've been married for ten days.

03:01:11.800 --> 03:01:13.520
Reject both icons.

03:01:13.520 --> 03:01:16.240
You're still a newlywed. You should have a reality TV show.

03:01:16.240 --> 03:01:18.040
Hell no!

03:01:18.040 --> 03:01:22.440
Alright, the final word of the show, one word that sums up everything that we did

03:01:22.440 --> 03:01:23.720

And we'll see you guys later on.

03:01:32.320 --> 03:01:37.320

03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:24.320
Riding a bloke with her tiara on

03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:29.320
Holding this humongous bouquet in her hand

03:02:29.320 --> 03:02:34.320
She looked great out of Disneyland

03:02:34.320 --> 03:02:38.320
You know what's a Cinderella ride? I mean definitely an E ticket

03:02:38.320 --> 03:02:44.320
Crowd was cheering, everyone was stoked

03:02:44.320 --> 03:02:48.320
I mean it was like the whole school was totally coked or something

03:02:48.320 --> 03:02:53.320
The band was playing, everything

03:02:53.320 --> 03:02:58.320
And all of a sudden, somebody screamed

03:02:58.320 --> 03:03:01.320
Look out! The Homecoming Queen's got a gun!

03:03:03.320 --> 03:03:05.320
Everybody runs

03:03:05.320 --> 03:03:08.320
The Homecoming Queen's got a gun

03:03:08.320 --> 03:03:11.320
Everybody runs

03:03:11.320 --> 03:03:15.320
The homecoming queen has got a gun

03:03:20.320 --> 03:03:23.320
Debbie smiling and waving her gun

03:03:23.320 --> 03:03:25.820
Picking up cheerleaders one by one

03:03:25.820 --> 03:03:28.820
Oh, Buffy's pom-pom just blew to bits

03:03:28.820 --> 03:03:31.820
Oh no, Miffy's head just did the splits

03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:34.820
God, my best friend's on a shooting spree

03:03:34.820 --> 03:03:37.820
Stop it, Debbie, you're embarrassing me

03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:40.820
How could you do what you just did?

03:03:40.820 --> 03:03:42.820
Are you having a really bad period?

03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:45.820
Everybody run

03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:48.820
The homecoming queen's got a gun

03:03:49.820 --> 03:03:51.820
Everybody run

03:03:51.820 --> 03:03:55.820
The homecoming queen has got a gun

03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:57.820
The king's been hit in the neck

03:03:57.820 --> 03:04:00.820
And the burner's been blown to death

03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:03.820
An hour later, the cops arrived

03:04:03.820 --> 03:04:05.820
But then the entire glee club had died

03:04:05.820 --> 03:04:06.820
No big loss

03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:08.820
You wouldn't believe what they brought the staffer

03:04:08.820 --> 03:04:11.820
Here we have machine guns, even a chopper!

03:04:11.820 --> 03:04:14.820
Throw down your gun in the yard and come out of the club!

03:04:14.820 --> 03:04:17.820
She said she didn't listen to what the cops said

03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:21.820
She aimed and fired and now the math teacher said I was really sad

03:04:21.820 --> 03:04:25.820
But kind of a relief, I mean, we had this big catch coming up next week

03:04:25.820 --> 03:04:28.820
Everybody runs

03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:31.820
The homecoming queen's got a gun

03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:34.820
Everybody runs

03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:37.820
The homecoming queen has got a gun

03:04:37.820 --> 03:04:39.420
She had got a gun

03:04:39.420 --> 03:04:41.420
She had a knife

03:04:41.420 --> 03:04:44.420
She went deep, happened to laugh

03:04:44.420 --> 03:04:47.420
The cops fired a warning shot that blew her off the float

03:04:47.420 --> 03:04:50.420
I tried to stream stuff, but it stuck in my throat

03:04:50.420 --> 03:04:53.420
She hit the ground and did a flip, it was real acrobatic

03:04:53.420 --> 03:04:56.420
But I was crying so hard, I couldn't work my eustematic

03:04:56.420 --> 03:04:58.420
I ran down to Debbie, I had to find out

03:04:58.420 --> 03:05:00.420
What made her do it?

03:05:00.420 --> 03:05:02.420
Why'd she pick out?

03:05:02.420 --> 03:05:04.420
I said the bullet had got her right in the ear

03:05:04.420 --> 03:05:09.420
I knew then the end was near.

03:05:09.420 --> 03:05:13.420
So I ran down and I said, in her good ear,

03:05:13.420 --> 03:05:15.420
Debbie, why did you do it?

03:05:15.420 --> 03:05:18.420
She raised her head, smiled, and said,

03:05:18.420 --> 03:05:23.420
I did it for Johnny.

03:05:23.420 --> 03:05:26.420
Johnny? Well, like, who's Johnny?

03:05:26.420 --> 03:05:28.420
Answer me, Debbie. Who's Johnny?

03:05:28.420 --> 03:05:30.420
Does anybody here know Johnny? Are you Johnny?

03:05:30.420 --> 03:05:32.420
There was one guy named Johnny, but he was a total geek

03:05:32.420 --> 03:05:34.420
He's a total geek and we've had food in his braces

03:05:34.420 --> 03:05:36.420
And to be Debbie, who's Johnny?

03:05:36.420 --> 03:05:41.420
Oh God, it's like that movie Citizen Kane, you know, where you later find out Rosebud was his lad

03:05:41.420 --> 03:05:44.420
But we'll never know who Johnny was since, like, she's dead

03:05:55.420 --> 03:05:58.420
Everybody runs

03:05:58.420 --> 03:06:01.420
The homecoming queen's got a gun

03:06:01.420 --> 03:06:07.420
Everybody run, the whole country queen has got us.

03:06:07.420 --> 03:06:09.420
Everybody run.
