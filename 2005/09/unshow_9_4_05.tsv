269950	274014	I wasn't going to be here this weekend, remember, that was the plan, because I was supposed to be getting laid.
274474	282902	I mean, I mean, I mean constipating my marriage.
283382	285764	Yeah, and that was constipating my marriage.
287366	288767	I was going to come be on the show.
289648	290889	Oh, thank you, my puppy.
291630	292871	I was going to come be on the show.
293593	298237	and have such a good time and be all happy and say how cool it is to eat and drink a lot.
299057	303881	And now... Now your microphone's breaking up because it knows that you're angst-filled.
304841	307223	Well, when you treat your microphone like that, that's why it acts like that.
307303	316590	And now I need more liquor because I took the time out of my honeymoon, my five days off from work, to come up here for this.
317030	317911	Although, I love you guys.
318391	319372	I love you too.
319973	320333	Happy wedding.
323216	325198	Oh, oh, oh, shit, I gotta get that song queued up.
325238	335731	Okay, first say hello to a guest that hasn't been here in like a year and a half, if not more, and the bitch was here tonight, and we didn't get to do a show tonight.

436714	437755	So Miklatov was here.
438884	448592	For tonight's show, even though we're not doing a show This is a special pre-tape message for our friends on the LiveJournal community Who are pissed off that we didn't do a show tonight So we're doing this for them So three people?
448872	459901	Yeah, I know But this is great, you know, Miklatov was here tonight And he was going to tell us the entire song list for Extreme 2 But now, thanks to Live365, it's gone, not going to happen Oh no 4400's awesome!

494411	495412	But there's a twist tonight.
495873	502018	Because we're talking about our bandwidth and people are going to be downloading this program unless we put it on a CD later for them to buy.

661959	662899	Rob with a bottle.
662980	663540	Bottle.
666621	671782	DarkSakura, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week even when we don't get allowed to do a show?
671822	672722	Because we hate Life 365.
672762	673223	Not that I really...
685157	686799	Oh, I'm sorry, I was playing jump rope with my puppy.
689461	697989	Um, Live365, when they announce a particular time to do their maintenance, needs to actually fucking stick with it!
699070	700551	And I need more booze, that's all.
701212	702473	Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, one more thing.
704274	710360	Getting married at the Department of Justice is like going to the DMV of weddings, thank you.
711826	713347	How was your wedding, though?
713928	719052	It was short, and Dan kept making faces at me to keep me from violently heaving all over the performer.
719273	723777	Iguana Girl said that she only had to go through, like, two pieces of Kleenex.
724257	726039	Oh, she went through two pieces of Kleenex?
726079	726239	No.
726599	728140	Two pieces of Kleenex.
728421	733765	I was about to, like, you know, start heaving violently, and Dan's like, By the way, I'm going to make faces at you.
734206	735066	You bastard!
736167	738770	So, yeah, I'm married now, and all of this stuff is mine.
740055	741696	That's an awesome way to look at it, FYI.
743178	748204	Alright, let's go to Loki with his FUs of the week.
753210	754411	Hey, it's my screwdriver.
754881	760344	Now, um, my excuse of the week, first off is to Nintendogs because I actually have to take care of the dog, I have to feed it every day.
760404	761705	It's like having an actual dog.
762025	764206	Why do I have to pay, you know, have an actual dog?
764266	764766	That sucks.
765387	771050	But anyways, so, I do it for the hell of it, and I don't have a jump rope, so that's sad.
771990	781035	Um, but anyways, um, then also, uh, fuck you to Stupid Drivers because they're all out there, just, you know, hordes of them, especially the holiday season.
781775	783236	Just sucks, and...
783598	786880	I guess Live 365 because I had a lot of music I wanted to play and that sucks.
787220	787720	But you know what?
788601	790021	I will still be drinking next week.
791662	792883	Why do you get to drink next week?
793243	794344	Well, what is next week?
795164	795984	Oh, your birthday.
797505	798005	Oh, damn.
799346	801207	So I'm taking that Monday off.
801707	806810	So hopefully I can drink next week, you know, depending on if I can get a ride.
807010	810872	But depending if I can get a ride, I'll be drinking next week.
811072	811312	All right.
811452	811873	And that's all.
812493	812753	All right.
813322	826171	MyFUs MyFU of the week goes to Live365 for fucking up our live show and disappointing all our listeners.
826271	827752	I hate you guys.
828232	837038	You know, I know, in case somebody from Live365 actually hears this, I don't really hate you guys, but you done pissed me off with this.
837138	838739	This was not good for business.
839120	842062	And if we go somewhere else because of this, I don't want you to be surprised.
843181	844762	Um, but that's that for now.
845302	851244	Um, otherwise, I give an FU to Miklatov for forcing me to buy Pump It Up, although he did pay for half of it, so I love him for that.
851644	852125	Miklatov?
853705	864749	I know, I ended up paying $20 for Pump, so I guess I shouldn't complain, but that's more money than I've ever spent playing Pump It Up, so... Thank you.
865230	866110	Thank you, Miklatov.
866850	867310	Thank you.
868371	868631	Alright.
869391	870351	Um, and let me think.
870411	870792	What else?
871252	871332	Um...
873025	878387	I give an F you to the fact that I have a whole week off of work, and because of the price of gas, I'm not going to be able to go anywhere.
878907	880847	That kind of pisses me off.
881448	882148	Gas prices suck.
882168	886229	I can't believe you drove up here today, Mel B. Because gas prices fucking suck.
886549	886849	Nah.
887249	889330	In Georgia, $6 per premium.
889830	895552	Here, it's hard to complain when we're here and not somewhere that was affected by that horrible, horrible hurricane.
896052	896252	But...
897168	897989	Yeah, it still sucks.
898029	898650	I still want to bitch.
898710	909124	Well, at least if there's any consolation, the Attorney General of California is actually looking into investigating the gas companies out here for price gouging because we're basically not affected by any...
911022	912023	Thank you for watching.
912043	912643	See you next time.
933186	936208	All right, we're going to go around and see some other angst in the room tonight.
936549	944014	And tonight's music we're going to use as the background for the FU music was something we were going to plug on tonight's show, except we didn't fucking have a show.
944154	950259	This is a compilation, Blood and Synth, a compilation, and it comes from Dark Records.
950299	956984	And you should visit their website, darkrecordsn, the letter N, darkrecordsnclothing.com.
957024	959366	So not and, but an N, darkrecordsnclothing.
960067	962869	And the song we're going to use is In Vitro with Foreign Land.
963479	963619	Mel B
975487	980709	Oh gosh, definitely EffieTheLife365 for not coming through this time.
981029	985531	Even when I listen to you guys at work, man, I listen to some of the worst ads that they put out.
986132	996856	You know, like after three songs, I have to hear some booty-ass R&B singer who ain't never gonna cut it in any kind of... I mean, they're not gonna be American Idol, Botswana Idol, none of that shit.
996976	998277	Botswana Idol!
998397	1002639	I swear to God, we are seriously contemplating moving after tonight's little shindig, so just...
1003946	1010415	We know that our listeners will move with us if we go to another site, so not to sound like a pompous ass, but we know they will.
1010975	1011436	We love them.
1011616	1012437	They love us.
1013018	1013779	So anyway, sorry.
1014099	1015701	So yeah, F you to them.
1016262	1018064	F you to $3 gas, man.
1018084	1021629	That's, I mean, yeah, I'm a sucker for driving up here, but hey, you know.
1022031	1023431	I would be a fool for you guys any week.
1024792	1024932	Aw.
1025272	1025712	Okay.
1026532	1029853	Mel B, can I... Is this supposed to be a secret or can I say thank you for this?
1029973	1034253	Oh, Mel B gave me copies of Orifice and Zonk's latest albums.
1034554	1035114	Orifice.
1035594	1036294	Best name ever.
1036474	1038114	Or-if-is, I guess.
1038734	1040835	I like saying Orifice because it sounds like a butt.
1041995	1051617	So, we're going to put the song Basil in the rotation because that's their new Ultramix 3 song and Zonk... We're going to play that CD at some point because they're cool.
1052358	1053179	So, alright.
1053659	1059285	So that was kind of like, uh, what was that, you can't do it on television, we were into opposites where we're actually giving props instead of giving FUs?
1060406	1061467	Yeah, I don't know, whatever.
1061587	1063609	Okay, anyway, back to reality.
1064049	1067893	Um, FU also to, uh, my Atari 2600, man.
1068314	1075861	It's like, I went to Classic Gaming Expo two weeks ago, I go out and buy an AC adapter and, like, a cable so I can put it into, like, a real TV and not those, like,
1076345	1078146	You know, RF adapters from like the 80s.
1078526	1082788	What happens, you know, I get all this stuff that, you know, now I can finally play Circus Atari and Breakout, and guess what?
1083088	1084949	My Atari 2600 is dead.
1086250	1087190	Aww, that sucks.
1087250	1090672	I mean, man, 20 years, couldn't have just held out another, like, 6 months?
1090752	1091552	Wait, wait, what system?
1091973	1092233	Oh, my 2600.
1093473	1100397	You know, um, depending on how long you're gonna be in town, um, the auction out here, usually sells 2600s pretty damn cheap.
1100877	1101037	Hmm.
1101673	1103194	Maybe, might be crashing out of frame.
1103214	1103994	I'll hunt one down for you.
1104435	1105375	Okay, good times.
1105836	1111259	But I think that's about... You can mod those new Atari, whatever those... Flashbacks?
1111399	1112099	The Flashbacks.
1112279	1116002	Flashback 2 to have a cartridge slot.
1116962	1118643	And it's all pinned out for you.
1118944	1122125	So you just solder some wires and you're good to go.
1123186	1123987	Well, I'll be damned.
1124747	1127509	And on that note, I'm going to pass it over this way.
1128009	1129390	Miss Pixie Dust, the...
1130163	1131364	Orange Lounge Madame.
1131804	1132484	What's on your mind?
1133305	1134045	Fuck me, baby.
1134085	1134365	Fuck me.
1134405	1134805	Fuck you.
1134825	1136106	Fuck you hard, huh, baby?
1136386	1136886	Oh, yeah.
1136966	1137727	Fuck me, bitch.
1138947	1143430	Well, fuck you to people that think they're Paris Hilton and they can bring their dogs in the fucking grocery store.
1143690	1144810	It's fucking nasty.
1145211	1149913	And I'm specifically pointing out one fat bitch that comes in on a scooter and smells like shit.
1150853	1151814	That comes in all the time.
1152534	1155716	Bitch, no one wants to see your nasty-ass fucking chihuahua mutt.
1156576	1157857	If you really want to bring a dog in the store...
1158624	1162405	Drop down the $200, go get Nintendogs, and be done with it.
1162425	1164406	Because no one wants to see your dog climbing up your titty.
1166067	1166467	Thank you.
1166727	1167407	Have a nice day.
1167747	1168667	Viking is the shit.
1169508	1170788	And I'm all good for now.
1171128	1171548	Alright.
1172609	1173449	No styling.
1173469	1174349	Hi!
1174409	1174830	How again?
1174850	1175650	Hi everybody.
1177318	1179179	I'm going to do a sales pitch on the phone.
1179239	1179599	No, I'm not.
1179779	1181020	Actually, I've been doing a great weekend.
1181440	1183101	There's no FU, so I'm going to pass the mic.
1183741	1184101	Wonderful.
1184161	1184661	Positive.
1184681	1185902	You've got to be positive about this weekend.
1186142	1188343	Fuck you and your positive.
1188363	1189023	You know where that goes?
1189223	1189503	Anywhere.
1189663	1190124	Oh, here you go.
1190184	1191624	I ain't drinking.
1191644	1192965	You ain't getting any ass tonight.
1193445	1196166	You ain't getting no... No butt sex for you.
1197167	1197567	None!
1198327	1199328	As if there was any to get.
1201229	1201869	Miklatov.
1202662	1205283	Dude, my dog is really good with the soccer ball.
1205503	1205823	FUs!
1206143	1207803	Oh, okay.
1208384	1211184	FU to not being next summer for the next season of the 4400.
1211224	1221247	FU to... I don't know.
1222347	1223688	I don't have any FUs.
1224508	1225148	You suck.
1226148	1227049	Yeah, I guess.
1228649	1229029	Alright.
1230090	1231530	So that's it for the FUs of the week.
1234042	1236103	What else can we get out of the way on this show here?
1236763	1237184	Let's see.
1237824	1238084	What?
1239125	1239425	Music.
1239925	1240285	Music?
1241066	1242006	I guess we could do one song.
1242026	1243167	I bought another dog.
1243367	1243887	Two songs?
1243927	1245248	Why do we have to do two songs?
1245628	1246308	Okay, fine, one song.
1246429	1247189	Alright, we'll do one song.
1248061	1251163	One thing I wanted to get out real fast though, news that happened this week.
1251804	1253925	DDR Ultramix 2 unlock code.
1254486	1261010	Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Control report for in the credit screen and you unlock all the songs.
1261230	1262251	That was announced this week.
1262271	1265113	Yeah, of course I knew that for like God knows how long.
1270129	1271170	V-Rare Tracklist Xtreme 2
1293911	1303558	Destiny, the piano version, Feelings Won't Fade, Extended Transmix, Midnight Blaze, System SF Mix, Can Be Real, Soulhouse Extended, Seduction, the vocal remix.
1303958	1321291	So basically a lot of shit you've pretty much heard before, except we've got Yuzo Koshiro with You've Gotta Move It, but otherwise you've got Sakura, Can Be Real, Colors, Infinite Prayer, Quickening, Un De Trois, Belovin', I Need You, La Morle... Yes, I know Seduction's brand new, but you know...
1323433	1325935	I'm sure it'll be a kick-butt V-Rare and you should all go buy it.
1326235	1329096	Put down your five bucks, go get your V-Rare.
1329136	1333119	Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, V2 is on its way, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
1333159	1340964	DDR Extreme won the Video Music Awards for Best Soundtrack, but you didn't see it on the actual show because it was one of those pre-show awards they gave away.
1341324	1344446	In other words, MTV doesn't give a shit about DDR.
1345266	1347828	But that's okay because I don't give a shit about MTV, so it works out.
1349509	1350890	A few other things that I'd mention.
1351270	1352010	All right, go for it.
1354452	1362256	In case you didn't know, there's going to be a demo on the two new DDRs, DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 for Karaoke Revolution Pop.
1363937	1365477	Now that's some juicy tidbit.
1365537	1366178	I didn't know this.
1366398	1371620	And the same thing for Karaoke Revolution 4 or Party or whatever.
1372181	1375122	It's going to be demos for whatever one.
1375911	1378892	I don't think I've heard this anywhere yet.
1379172	1385333	So, wow, our listeners just got a real juicy tidbit there, so if you were able to put up with the show at this point, it was worth it.
1385353	1394694	Also, let me just say, well, I don't know if I can say anything, but Konami's going to be spending more time in the courts.
1394734	1396535	Let me just put it that way.
1396555	1398395	Ooh, interesting.
1398475	1401216	So you made a new friend at Konami that told you all sorts of stuff, didn't you?
1401276	1402336	Yeah, he's my new friend.
1402576	1403736	He's going to send us actually the...
1404457	1407659	V-Rares for Ultra Mix 3 and Extreme 2 pretty soon.
1407959	1408700	Very interesting.
1408740	1410280	So we'll get the first tidbits on that.
1410561	1411361	Ooh, I'm excited.
1411581	1412642	I'm hopefully at Ultra Mix 3.
1413002	1415363	He said whatever he has, so... Stay tuned to Orange Lounge.
1415584	1420406	But we got that, and I got a ton of Diverse System stuff we've got.
1420426	1421627	You know, lots of fun stuff.
1421647	1424789	All right, we're going to play one song on this little special show.
1424809	1426330	This is actually from not Diverse System.
1426370	1429672	This is from Good Cool, the Ultra Expander.
1430692	1430853	And...
1432284	1438026	It's a remix of Absolute, the ultimate remix, and it definitely fits that title.
1438266	1439606	Alright, so here it is.
1439766	1443947	We're going to play this for you guys on the Orange Lounge Radio Not Show that we didn't have tonight.
1444968	1448969	Good Cool with DJ Taka, the absolute ultimate mix.
1449029	1450509	Here it is on Orange Lounge Radio.
1450529	1452170	Good Cool.
1585546	1586166	Thanks for watching!
1691826	1700952	Good Cool with DJ Taka Absolute, the ultimate remix here on the Orange Lounge It Didn't Happen episode.
1701512	1703213	And it won the cage match that never happened.
1703313	1705154	Yes, it won the cage match that never happened, actually.
1706575	1708876	That pisses me off because I had a really funny song.
1710277	1713119	You know, Miklatov picked my song tonight, too, and we didn't even get to do it.
1714898	1715458	and DarkSakura.
1715498	1716339	Reject false icons.
1716359	1716539	Loki.
1742919	1751706	I need some Guinness to go with these cookies and Mel B, your final thought where were my drinks?
1751726	1753187	go get one!
1771892	1772412	Have a Guinness.
1772432	1773173	They're good for you.
1773573	1781178	They're full of vitamin G. And vitamin I. The final word of the show that didn't happen.
1782458	1783099	Pixie Dust.
1785941	1786261	Yes.
1786761	1787341	Bike it in.
1788702	1793525	That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.
1794346	1798548	Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.
