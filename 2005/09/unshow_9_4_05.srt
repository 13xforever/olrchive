00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:54,843
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

156
00:09:55,954 --> 00:09:58,555
[SPEAKER_11]: So you know that we're a little bit angsty.

157
00:09:58,635 --> 00:09:59,935
[SPEAKER_04]: You have the fro.

158
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:00,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at this.

159
00:10:01,356 --> 00:10:03,556
[SPEAKER_11]: He has the African fro.

160
00:10:03,796 --> 00:10:05,897
[SPEAKER_11]: My dog has a pirate hat.

161
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:06,877
[SPEAKER_11]: It's awesome.

162
00:10:07,297 --> 00:10:09,338
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any hats, but I have a ribbon now.

163
00:10:09,538 --> 00:10:12,339
[SPEAKER_11]: I can give you a present when we do bark mode later.

164
00:10:12,359 --> 00:10:12,899
[SPEAKER_04]: I want a hat.

165
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:15,840
[SPEAKER_11]: Anyway.

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,661
[SPEAKER_04]: I gave you a ghetto tennis ball.

167
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,442
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm getting off track here, not that that's anything unusual.

168
00:10:23,547 --> 00:10:24,527
[SPEAKER_11]: Penguin Penguin No styling, good job

169
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,197
[SPEAKER_03]: What color is it?

170
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:59,118
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you say what this is?

171
00:10:59,719 --> 00:11:00,479
[SPEAKER_11]: Bottle.

172
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:02,899
[SPEAKER_11]: Rob with a bottle.

173
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:03,540
[SPEAKER_11]: Bottle.

174
00:11:06,621 --> 00:11:11,782
[SPEAKER_11]: DarkSakura, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week even when we don't get allowed to do a show?

175
00:11:11,822 --> 00:11:12,722
[SPEAKER_11]: Because we hate Life 365.

176
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:13,223
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that I really...

177
00:11:25,157 --> 00:11:26,799
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I'm sorry, I was playing jump rope with my puppy.

178
00:11:29,461 --> 00:11:37,989
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, Live365, when they announce a particular time to do their maintenance, needs to actually fucking stick with it!

179
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:40,551
[SPEAKER_04]: And I need more booze, that's all.

180
00:11:41,212 --> 00:11:42,473
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, one more thing.

181
00:11:44,274 --> 00:11:50,360
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting married at the Department of Justice is like going to the DMV of weddings, thank you.

182
00:11:51,826 --> 00:11:53,347
[SPEAKER_11]: How was your wedding, though?

183
00:11:53,928 --> 00:11:59,052
[SPEAKER_04]: It was short, and Dan kept making faces at me to keep me from violently heaving all over the performer.

184
00:11:59,273 --> 00:12:03,777
[SPEAKER_11]: Iguana Girl said that she only had to go through, like, two pieces of Kleenex.

185
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:06,039
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, she went through two pieces of Kleenex?

186
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:06,239
[SPEAKER_11]: No.

187
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:08,140
[SPEAKER_04]: Two pieces of Kleenex.

188
00:12:08,421 --> 00:12:13,765
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about to, like, you know, start heaving violently, and Dan's like, By the way, I'm going to make faces at you.

189
00:12:14,206 --> 00:12:15,066
[SPEAKER_04]: You bastard!

190
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,770
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I'm married now, and all of this stuff is mine.

191
00:12:20,055 --> 00:12:21,696
[SPEAKER_11]: That's an awesome way to look at it, FYI.

192
00:12:23,178 --> 00:12:28,204
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, let's go to Loki with his FUs of the week.

193
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,411
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, it's my screwdriver.

194
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:40,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, um, my excuse of the week, first off is to Nintendogs because I actually have to take care of the dog, I have to feed it every day.

195
00:12:40,404 --> 00:12:41,705
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like having an actual dog.

196
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,206
[SPEAKER_10]: Why do I have to pay, you know, have an actual dog?

197
00:12:44,266 --> 00:12:44,766
[SPEAKER_10]: That sucks.

198
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:51,050
[SPEAKER_10]: But anyways, so, I do it for the hell of it, and I don't have a jump rope, so that's sad.

199
00:12:51,990 --> 00:13:01,035
[SPEAKER_10]: Um, but anyways, um, then also, uh, fuck you to Stupid Drivers because they're all out there, just, you know, hordes of them, especially the holiday season.

200
00:13:01,775 --> 00:13:03,236
[SPEAKER_10]: Just sucks, and...

201
00:13:03,598 --> 00:13:06,880
[SPEAKER_10]: I guess Live 365 because I had a lot of music I wanted to play and that sucks.

202
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:07,720
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know what?

203
00:13:08,601 --> 00:13:10,021
[SPEAKER_10]: I will still be drinking next week.

204
00:13:11,662 --> 00:13:12,883
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do you get to drink next week?

205
00:13:13,243 --> 00:13:14,344
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what is next week?

206
00:13:15,164 --> 00:13:15,984
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, your birthday.

207
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:18,005
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, damn.

208
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:21,207
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm taking that Monday off.

209
00:13:21,707 --> 00:13:26,810
[SPEAKER_10]: So hopefully I can drink next week, you know, depending on if I can get a ride.

210
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,872
[SPEAKER_10]: But depending if I can get a ride, I'll be drinking next week.

211
00:13:31,072 --> 00:13:31,312
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.

212
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:31,873
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's all.

213
00:13:32,493 --> 00:13:32,753
[SPEAKER_11]: All right.

214
00:13:33,322 --> 00:13:46,171
[SPEAKER_11]: MyFUs MyFU of the week goes to Live365 for fucking up our live show and disappointing all our listeners.

215
00:13:46,271 --> 00:13:47,752
[SPEAKER_11]: I hate you guys.

216
00:13:48,232 --> 00:13:57,038
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, I know, in case somebody from Live365 actually hears this, I don't really hate you guys, but you done pissed me off with this.

217
00:13:57,138 --> 00:13:58,739
[SPEAKER_11]: This was not good for business.

218
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,062
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we go somewhere else because of this, I don't want you to be surprised.

219
00:14:03,181 --> 00:14:04,762
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but that's that for now.

220
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:11,244
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, otherwise, I give an FU to Miklatov for forcing me to buy Pump It Up, although he did pay for half of it, so I love him for that.

221
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:12,125
[SPEAKER_11]: Miklatov?

222
00:14:13,705 --> 00:14:24,749
[SPEAKER_11]: I know, I ended up paying $20 for Pump, so I guess I shouldn't complain, but that's more money than I've ever spent playing Pump It Up, so... Thank you.

223
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:26,110
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, Miklatov.

224
00:14:26,850 --> 00:14:27,310
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.

225
00:14:28,371 --> 00:14:28,631
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

226
00:14:29,391 --> 00:14:30,351
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and let me think.

227
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:30,792
[SPEAKER_11]: What else?

228
00:14:31,252 --> 00:14:31,332
[SPEAKER_11]: Um...

229
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:38,387
[SPEAKER_11]: I give an F you to the fact that I have a whole week off of work, and because of the price of gas, I'm not going to be able to go anywhere.

230
00:14:38,907 --> 00:14:40,847
[SPEAKER_11]: That kind of pisses me off.

231
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:42,148
[SPEAKER_11]: Gas prices suck.

232
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:46,229
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't believe you drove up here today, Mel B. Because gas prices fucking suck.

233
00:14:46,549 --> 00:14:46,849
[SPEAKER_04]: Nah.

234
00:14:47,249 --> 00:14:49,330
[SPEAKER_04]: In Georgia, $6 per premium.

235
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:55,552
[SPEAKER_11]: Here, it's hard to complain when we're here and not somewhere that was affected by that horrible, horrible hurricane.

236
00:14:56,052 --> 00:14:56,252
[SPEAKER_11]: But...

237
00:14:57,168 --> 00:14:57,989
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, it still sucks.

238
00:14:58,029 --> 00:14:58,650
[SPEAKER_11]: I still want to bitch.

239
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:09,124
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, at least if there's any consolation, the Attorney General of California is actually looking into investigating the gas companies out here for price gouging because we're basically not affected by any...

240
00:15:11,022 --> 00:15:12,023
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching.

241
00:15:12,043 --> 00:15:12,643
[SPEAKER_11]: See you next time.

242
00:15:33,186 --> 00:15:36,208
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're going to go around and see some other angst in the room tonight.

243
00:15:36,549 --> 00:15:44,014
[SPEAKER_11]: And tonight's music we're going to use as the background for the FU music was something we were going to plug on tonight's show, except we didn't fucking have a show.

244
00:15:44,154 --> 00:15:50,259
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a compilation, Blood and Synth, a compilation, and it comes from Dark Records.

245
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:56,984
[SPEAKER_11]: And you should visit their website, darkrecordsn, the letter N, darkrecordsnclothing.com.

246
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:59,366
[SPEAKER_11]: So not and, but an N, darkrecordsnclothing.

247
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:02,869
[SPEAKER_11]: And the song we're going to use is In Vitro with Foreign Land.

248
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:03,619
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B

249
00:16:15,487 --> 00:16:20,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh gosh, definitely EffieTheLife365 for not coming through this time.

250
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:25,531
[SPEAKER_12]: Even when I listen to you guys at work, man, I listen to some of the worst ads that they put out.

251
00:16:26,132 --> 00:16:36,856
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, like after three songs, I have to hear some booty-ass R&B singer who ain't never gonna cut it in any kind of... I mean, they're not gonna be American Idol, Botswana Idol, none of that shit.

252
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:38,277
[SPEAKER_12]: Botswana Idol!

253
00:16:38,397 --> 00:16:42,639
[SPEAKER_11]: I swear to God, we are seriously contemplating moving after tonight's little shindig, so just...

254
00:16:43,946 --> 00:16:50,415
[SPEAKER_11]: We know that our listeners will move with us if we go to another site, so not to sound like a pompous ass, but we know they will.

255
00:16:50,975 --> 00:16:51,436
[SPEAKER_11]: We love them.

256
00:16:51,616 --> 00:16:52,437
[SPEAKER_11]: They love us.

257
00:16:53,018 --> 00:16:53,779
[SPEAKER_11]: So anyway, sorry.

258
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:55,701
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, F you to them.

259
00:16:56,262 --> 00:16:58,064
[SPEAKER_12]: F you to $3 gas, man.

260
00:16:58,084 --> 00:17:01,629
[SPEAKER_12]: That's, I mean, yeah, I'm a sucker for driving up here, but hey, you know.

261
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:03,431
[SPEAKER_12]: I would be a fool for you guys any week.

262
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:04,932
[SPEAKER_11]: Aw.

263
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:05,712
[SPEAKER_11]: Okay.

264
00:17:06,532 --> 00:17:09,853
[SPEAKER_11]: Mel B, can I... Is this supposed to be a secret or can I say thank you for this?

265
00:17:09,973 --> 00:17:14,253
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, Mel B gave me copies of Orifice and Zonk's latest albums.

266
00:17:14,554 --> 00:17:15,114
[SPEAKER_04]: Orifice.

267
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:16,294
[SPEAKER_11]: Best name ever.

268
00:17:16,474 --> 00:17:18,114
[SPEAKER_11]: Or-if-is, I guess.

269
00:17:18,734 --> 00:17:20,835
[SPEAKER_11]: I like saying Orifice because it sounds like a butt.

270
00:17:21,995 --> 00:17:31,617
[SPEAKER_11]: So, we're going to put the song Basil in the rotation because that's their new Ultramix 3 song and Zonk... We're going to play that CD at some point because they're cool.

271
00:17:32,358 --> 00:17:33,179
[SPEAKER_11]: So, alright.

272
00:17:33,659 --> 00:17:39,285
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was kind of like, uh, what was that, you can't do it on television, we were into opposites where we're actually giving props instead of giving FUs?

273
00:17:40,406 --> 00:17:41,467
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I don't know, whatever.

274
00:17:41,587 --> 00:17:43,609
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, anyway, back to reality.

275
00:17:44,049 --> 00:17:47,893
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, FU also to, uh, my Atari 2600, man.

276
00:17:48,314 --> 00:17:55,861
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like, I went to Classic Gaming Expo two weeks ago, I go out and buy an AC adapter and, like, a cable so I can put it into, like, a real TV and not those, like,

277
00:17:56,345 --> 00:17:58,146
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, RF adapters from like the 80s.

278
00:17:58,526 --> 00:18:02,788
[SPEAKER_12]: What happens, you know, I get all this stuff that, you know, now I can finally play Circus Atari and Breakout, and guess what?

279
00:18:03,088 --> 00:18:04,949
[SPEAKER_12]: My Atari 2600 is dead.

280
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,190
[SPEAKER_12]: Aww, that sucks.

281
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:10,672
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, man, 20 years, couldn't have just held out another, like, 6 months?

282
00:18:10,752 --> 00:18:11,552
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, what system?

283
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:12,233
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, my 2600.

284
00:18:13,473 --> 00:18:20,397
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, um, depending on how long you're gonna be in town, um, the auction out here, usually sells 2600s pretty damn cheap.

285
00:18:20,877 --> 00:18:21,037
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm.

286
00:18:21,673 --> 00:18:23,194
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe, might be crashing out of frame.

287
00:18:23,214 --> 00:18:23,994
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll hunt one down for you.

288
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:25,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, good times.

289
00:18:25,836 --> 00:18:31,259
[SPEAKER_10]: But I think that's about... You can mod those new Atari, whatever those... Flashbacks?

290
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:32,099
[SPEAKER_10]: The Flashbacks.

291
00:18:32,279 --> 00:18:36,002
[SPEAKER_10]: Flashback 2 to have a cartridge slot.

292
00:18:36,962 --> 00:18:38,643
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's all pinned out for you.

293
00:18:38,944 --> 00:18:42,125
[SPEAKER_10]: So you just solder some wires and you're good to go.

294
00:18:43,186 --> 00:18:43,987
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I'll be damned.

295
00:18:44,747 --> 00:18:47,509
[SPEAKER_12]: And on that note, I'm going to pass it over this way.

296
00:18:48,009 --> 00:18:49,390
[SPEAKER_11]: Miss Pixie Dust, the...

297
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:51,364
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Madame.

298
00:18:51,804 --> 00:18:52,484
[SPEAKER_11]: What's on your mind?

299
00:18:53,305 --> 00:18:54,045
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck me, baby.

300
00:18:54,085 --> 00:18:54,365
[SPEAKER_11]: Fuck me.

301
00:18:54,405 --> 00:18:54,805
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you.

302
00:18:54,825 --> 00:18:56,106
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck you hard, huh, baby?

303
00:18:56,386 --> 00:18:56,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.

304
00:18:56,966 --> 00:18:57,727
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck me, bitch.

305
00:18:58,947 --> 00:19:03,430
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, fuck you to people that think they're Paris Hilton and they can bring their dogs in the fucking grocery store.

306
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,810
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fucking nasty.

307
00:19:05,211 --> 00:19:09,913
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm specifically pointing out one fat bitch that comes in on a scooter and smells like shit.

308
00:19:10,853 --> 00:19:11,814
[SPEAKER_03]: That comes in all the time.

309
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:15,716
[SPEAKER_03]: Bitch, no one wants to see your nasty-ass fucking chihuahua mutt.

310
00:19:16,576 --> 00:19:17,857
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really want to bring a dog in the store...

311
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,405
[SPEAKER_03]: Drop down the $200, go get Nintendogs, and be done with it.

312
00:19:22,425 --> 00:19:24,406
[SPEAKER_03]: Because no one wants to see your dog climbing up your titty.

313
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:26,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.

314
00:19:26,727 --> 00:19:27,407
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a nice day.

315
00:19:27,747 --> 00:19:28,667
[SPEAKER_03]: Viking is the shit.

316
00:19:29,508 --> 00:19:30,788
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm all good for now.

317
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:31,548
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

318
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:33,449
[SPEAKER_11]: No styling.

319
00:19:33,469 --> 00:19:34,349
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi!

320
00:19:34,409 --> 00:19:34,830
[SPEAKER_13]: How again?

321
00:19:34,850 --> 00:19:35,650
[SPEAKER_13]: Hi everybody.

322
00:19:37,318 --> 00:19:39,179
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm going to do a sales pitch on the phone.

323
00:19:39,239 --> 00:19:39,599
[SPEAKER_13]: No, I'm not.

324
00:19:39,779 --> 00:19:41,020
[SPEAKER_13]: Actually, I've been doing a great weekend.

325
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,101
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no FU, so I'm going to pass the mic.

326
00:19:43,741 --> 00:19:44,101
[SPEAKER_13]: Wonderful.

327
00:19:44,161 --> 00:19:44,661
[SPEAKER_13]: Positive.

328
00:19:44,681 --> 00:19:45,902
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to be positive about this weekend.

329
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,343
[SPEAKER_13]: Fuck you and your positive.

330
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:49,023
[SPEAKER_13]: You know where that goes?

331
00:19:49,223 --> 00:19:49,503
[SPEAKER_13]: Anywhere.

332
00:19:49,663 --> 00:19:50,124
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, here you go.

333
00:19:50,184 --> 00:19:51,624
[SPEAKER_03]: I ain't drinking.

334
00:19:51,644 --> 00:19:52,965
[SPEAKER_03]: You ain't getting any ass tonight.

335
00:19:53,445 --> 00:19:56,166
[SPEAKER_11]: You ain't getting no... No butt sex for you.

336
00:19:57,167 --> 00:19:57,567
[SPEAKER_03]: None!

337
00:19:58,327 --> 00:19:59,328
[SPEAKER_03]: As if there was any to get.

338
00:20:01,229 --> 00:20:01,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov.

339
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:05,283
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, my dog is really good with the soccer ball.

340
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:05,823
[SPEAKER_02]: FUs!

341
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:07,803
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

342
00:20:08,384 --> 00:20:11,184
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to not being next summer for the next season of the 4400.

343
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:21,247
[SPEAKER_02]: FU to... I don't know.

344
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:23,688
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any FUs.

345
00:20:24,508 --> 00:20:25,148
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

346
00:20:26,148 --> 00:20:27,049
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess.

347
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:29,029
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright.

348
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,530
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's it for the FUs of the week.

349
00:20:34,042 --> 00:20:36,103
[SPEAKER_11]: What else can we get out of the way on this show here?

350
00:20:36,763 --> 00:20:37,184
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's see.

351
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:38,084
[SPEAKER_11]: What?

352
00:20:39,125 --> 00:20:39,425
[SPEAKER_11]: Music.

353
00:20:39,925 --> 00:20:40,285
[SPEAKER_11]: Music?

354
00:20:41,066 --> 00:20:42,006
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess we could do one song.

355
00:20:42,026 --> 00:20:43,167
[SPEAKER_11]: I bought another dog.

356
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:43,887
[SPEAKER_11]: Two songs?

357
00:20:43,927 --> 00:20:45,248
[SPEAKER_11]: Why do we have to do two songs?

358
00:20:45,628 --> 00:20:46,308
Okay, fine, one song.

359
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:47,189
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, we'll do one song.

360
00:20:48,061 --> 00:20:51,163
[SPEAKER_11]: One thing I wanted to get out real fast though, news that happened this week.

361
00:20:51,804 --> 00:20:53,925
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Ultramix 2 unlock code.

362
00:20:54,486 --> 00:21:01,010
[SPEAKER_11]: Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A. Control report for in the credit screen and you unlock all the songs.

363
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:02,251
[SPEAKER_11]: That was announced this week.

364
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:05,113
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, of course I knew that for like God knows how long.

365
00:21:10,129 --> 00:21:11,170
[SPEAKER_12]: V-Rare Tracklist Xtreme 2

366
00:21:33,911 --> 00:21:43,558
[SPEAKER_11]: Destiny, the piano version, Feelings Won't Fade, Extended Transmix, Midnight Blaze, System SF Mix, Can Be Real, Soulhouse Extended, Seduction, the vocal remix.

367
00:21:43,958 --> 00:22:01,291
[SPEAKER_11]: So basically a lot of shit you've pretty much heard before, except we've got Yuzo Koshiro with You've Gotta Move It, but otherwise you've got Sakura, Can Be Real, Colors, Infinite Prayer, Quickening, Un De Trois, Belovin', I Need You, La Morle... Yes, I know Seduction's brand new, but you know...

368
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,935
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm sure it'll be a kick-butt V-Rare and you should all go buy it.

369
00:22:06,235 --> 00:22:09,096
[SPEAKER_11]: Put down your five bucks, go get your V-Rare.

370
00:22:09,136 --> 00:22:13,119
[SPEAKER_11]: Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania, V2 is on its way, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

371
00:22:13,159 --> 00:22:20,964
[SPEAKER_11]: DDR Extreme won the Video Music Awards for Best Soundtrack, but you didn't see it on the actual show because it was one of those pre-show awards they gave away.

372
00:22:21,324 --> 00:22:24,446
[SPEAKER_11]: In other words, MTV doesn't give a shit about DDR.

373
00:22:25,266 --> 00:22:27,828
[SPEAKER_11]: But that's okay because I don't give a shit about MTV, so it works out.

374
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:30,890
[SPEAKER_10]: A few other things that I'd mention.

375
00:22:31,270 --> 00:22:32,010
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, go for it.

376
00:22:34,452 --> 00:22:42,256
[SPEAKER_10]: In case you didn't know, there's going to be a demo on the two new DDRs, DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3 for Karaoke Revolution Pop.

377
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:45,477
[SPEAKER_10]: Now that's some juicy tidbit.

378
00:22:45,537 --> 00:22:46,178
[SPEAKER_10]: I didn't know this.

379
00:22:46,398 --> 00:22:51,620
[SPEAKER_10]: And the same thing for Karaoke Revolution 4 or Party or whatever.

380
00:22:52,181 --> 00:22:55,122
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to be demos for whatever one.

381
00:22:55,911 --> 00:22:58,892
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've heard this anywhere yet.

382
00:22:59,172 --> 00:23:05,333
[SPEAKER_11]: So, wow, our listeners just got a real juicy tidbit there, so if you were able to put up with the show at this point, it was worth it.

383
00:23:05,353 --> 00:23:14,694
[SPEAKER_10]: Also, let me just say, well, I don't know if I can say anything, but Konami's going to be spending more time in the courts.

384
00:23:14,734 --> 00:23:16,535
[SPEAKER_10]: Let me just put it that way.

385
00:23:16,555 --> 00:23:18,395
[SPEAKER_11]: Ooh, interesting.

386
00:23:18,475 --> 00:23:21,216
[SPEAKER_11]: So you made a new friend at Konami that told you all sorts of stuff, didn't you?

387
00:23:21,276 --> 00:23:22,336
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he's my new friend.

388
00:23:22,576 --> 00:23:23,736
[SPEAKER_10]: He's going to send us actually the...

389
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:27,659
[SPEAKER_10]: V-Rares for Ultra Mix 3 and Extreme 2 pretty soon.

390
00:23:27,959 --> 00:23:28,700
[SPEAKER_08]: Very interesting.

391
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,280
[SPEAKER_10]: So we'll get the first tidbits on that.

392
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:31,361
[SPEAKER_08]: Ooh, I'm excited.

393
00:23:31,581 --> 00:23:32,642
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm hopefully at Ultra Mix 3.

394
00:23:33,002 --> 00:23:35,363
[SPEAKER_10]: He said whatever he has, so... Stay tuned to Orange Lounge.

395
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:40,406
[SPEAKER_10]: But we got that, and I got a ton of Diverse System stuff we've got.

396
00:23:40,426 --> 00:23:41,627
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, lots of fun stuff.

397
00:23:41,647 --> 00:23:44,789
[SPEAKER_11]: All right, we're going to play one song on this little special show.

398
00:23:44,809 --> 00:23:46,330
[SPEAKER_10]: This is actually from not Diverse System.

399
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,672
[SPEAKER_10]: This is from Good Cool, the Ultra Expander.

400
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:50,853
[SPEAKER_10]: And...

401
00:23:52,284 --> 00:23:58,026
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a remix of Absolute, the ultimate remix, and it definitely fits that title.

402
00:23:58,266 --> 00:23:59,606
[SPEAKER_11]: Alright, so here it is.

403
00:23:59,766 --> 00:24:03,947
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to play this for you guys on the Orange Lounge Radio Not Show that we didn't have tonight.

404
00:24:04,968 --> 00:24:08,969
[SPEAKER_11]: Good Cool with DJ Taka, the absolute ultimate mix.

405
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,509
[SPEAKER_11]: Here it is on Orange Lounge Radio.

410
00:28:23,313 --> 00:28:25,154
[SPEAKER_11]: Yes, it won the cage match that never happened, actually.

411
00:28:26,575 --> 00:28:28,876
[SPEAKER_04]: That pisses me off because I had a really funny song.

412
00:28:30,277 --> 00:28:33,119
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, Miklatov picked my song tonight, too, and we didn't even get to do it.

[SPEAKER_10]: I need some Guinness to go with these cookies and Mel B, your final thought where were my drinks?

417
00:29:11,726 --> 00:29:13,187
go get one!

418
00:29:31,892 --> 00:29:32,412
[SPEAKER_04]: Have a Guinness.

419
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:33,173
[SPEAKER_04]: They're good for you.

420
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:41,178
[SPEAKER_11]: They're full of vitamin G. And vitamin I. The final word of the show that didn't happen.
