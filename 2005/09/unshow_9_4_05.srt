00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:24,780
This is a special pre-taped message for our friends on the LiveJournal community who are

85
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,900
pissed off that we didn't do a show tonight.

86
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:27,940
So we're doing this for them.

87
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,940

00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,400
You know, Mikolatov was here tonight and he was going to tell us the entire song list

00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:02,420
You can always feed Menchi to the other dogs in case, you know, you didn't have enough food.

Alright, alright. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to do a couple of our favorite segments here on

That sucks.

159
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:51,780
But anyways, so, I do it for the hell of it, and I don't have a jump rope, so that's sad.

160
00:12:51,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Um, but anyways, um, then also, uh, fuck you to stupid drivers because they're all out

161
00:12:57,780 --> 00:13:03,300
there, just, you know, hordes of them, especially the holiday season, just sucks.

162
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:07,660
Guess the live 365 because I had a lot of music. I want to play and that sucks, but you know what?

163
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,900
I will still be drinking next week

164
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,140
Why do you get to drink next week? Well, what is next week? Oh your birthday? Oh

165
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,960
damn

166
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:24,080
So, uh, I'm taking that Monday off. So hopefully hopefully I can drink next week, you know

167
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,260
pending on if I can get a ride, but um

168
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:31,100
Penny and if I can get a ride, I'll be drinking next week.

169
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,500
Alright, and that's all.

170
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,500
Alright.

171
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:40,940
My FUs.

172
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:46,220
My FU of the week goes to lie365 for fucking up our live show and disappointing our listeners.

173
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,260
I hate you guys.

174
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:54,980
You know, I know, in case somebody from lie365 actually hears this, I don't really hate you

175
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:57,220
guys but you don't piss me off with this.

176
00:13:57,220 --> 00:14:01,180
This was not good for business, and if we go somewhere else because of this, you know,

177
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:04,060
I don't want you to be surprised.

178
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:05,660
But that's that for now.

179
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:09,580
Otherwise I give an FU to Miklotov for forcing me to buy Pump It Up, although he did pay

180
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,780
for half of it, so I love him for that.

181
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,780
Miklotov?

182
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,420
I know, I ended up paying $20 for Pump, so I guess I shouldn't just complain, but that's

183
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:24,580
more money than I've ever spent playing Pump It Up, so...

184
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:33,260
Thank you. Thank you Miklotov. Thank you. Alright. And let me think, what else? I give

185
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:37,380
an F.U. to the fact that I have a whole week off of work and because of the price of gas,

186
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,420
I'm not going to be able to go anywhere. That kind of pisses me off. Gas prices suck. I

187
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:47,320
can't believe you drove up here today, Mel B. Because gas prices fucking suck. Nah, in

188
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:53,300
Georgia, $6 for premium. Here, it's hard to complain when we're here and not, you know,

189
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:58,580
That was affected by that horrible horrible hurricane, but yeah, it still sucks. I still want to bitch

190
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:04,580
well, at least if there's any consolation to attorney general of California is actually looking into investigating the

191
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:09,900
Gas companies out here for a price gouging because we're basically not affected by you any

192
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:13,860
Refineries that are hallelujah stick it to the man

193
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:18,020
That's what I say in the butt stick it to the man in the butt actually in in defense though

194
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,020
So, Jubb has finally done something right.

195
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,940
For all the people price gouging in Florida, he is arresting them and giving them hefty

196
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
fines.

197
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:26,940
Good.

198
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,900
I've heard in some cases, inequivalent to the profits made after gouging the price.

199
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Sounds good to me.

200
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:36,660
Alright, we're gonna go around and see some other angst in the room tonight.

201
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,900
And tonight's music we're gonna use as a background for the F.U. music was something we were gonna

202
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,260
plug on tonight's show, except we didn't fucking have a show.

203
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:49,180
is a compilation blood it's blood and synth a compilation and it comes from

204
00:15:49,180 --> 00:15:53,900
dark records and you should visit their website dark records in the letter N

205
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:59,300
dark records and clothing comm so not and but an end dark records in clothing

206
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:03,880
and the song we're going to use is in vitro with foreign land all right so

207
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:10,460
let's get out some angst to this um oops and I I should probably all right let's

208
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:12,720
Let's get some angst out to this song.

209
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:19,080
Starting off with who's got a mic, Mel B. Oh gosh, definitely Effy The Live 365 for

210
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,160
just not coming through this time.

211
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:24,880
Even when I listen to you guys at work, man, I listen to some of the worst ads that they

212
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,880
put out.

213
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:31,000
You know, like after three songs, I have to hear some booty-ass R&B singer who ain't never

214
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:36,040
gonna cut it in any kind of, I mean, they're not gonna be American Idol, Botswana Idol,

215
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:37,040
none of that shit.

216
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,040
Botswana Idol!

217
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:42,640
I swear to God, we are seriously contemplating moving after tonight's little shindig, so just...

218
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:47,260
We know that our listeners will move with us if we go to another site, so...

219
00:16:47,780 --> 00:16:51,400
And not to sound like a pompous ass, but we know they will. We love them.

220
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,620
They love us!

221
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,940
So anyway, sorry.

222
00:16:53,940 --> 00:17:00,780
So yeah, F.E.T. them, F.E.T. $3 gas, man. That's... I mean, yeah, I'm a sucker for driving up here,

223
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:03,620
but hey, you know, I would be a fool for you guys any week.

224
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,060
Awwww!

225
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:09,800
Okay. Oh, okay. Mel B. Can I is this supposed to be a secret or can I say thank you for this?

226
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,980
Oh Mel B gave me copies of orifice and Zonk's latest albums orifice

227
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:22,120
I know or if is I guess but it's I like saying orifice cuz you know, it sounds like a but um, so

228
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:28,080
We're gonna put the song bass bass ill in the rotation because that's their new Ultra Mix 3 song and Zonk

229
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:34,260
Well, we just got we're gonna play a CD at some point cuz they're cool. So alright, so that was kind of like

230
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:37,780
uh what was that you can't do it on television we were into opposites but we're actually giving

231
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:45,220
props instead of giving fus yeah i don't know whatever okay anyway back to reality um fu also

232
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:51,140
to uh my atari 2600 man it's like i went to classic gaming expo two weeks ago i go out and

233
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:56,180
buy an ac adapter and like a cable so i could put it into like a real tv and not those like

234
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,020
you know rf adapters from like the 80s what happens you know i get all this stuff that you

235
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:03,180

240
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:33,140

241
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:42,020
Cartridge slot and then it's all pinned out for you. So you just you solder some wires and you're good to go

261
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:44,860
music music I guess we could do one song two songs wait why do we have to do two

262
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:50,140
songs I don't do one song one thing I wanted to get out real fast so a news

263
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:55,220
that happened this week DDR ultra mix to unlock code up up down down left right

264
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:58,620
left right BA up up down down left right left right BA in controller port for in

the credit screen and you unlock all the songs that was announced this week of

266
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:10,580
course I knew that for like god knows how long. Pssst, so did I. Shh, but that's a secret.

267
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:14,860
Alright, um. I'm surprised they never figured it out for like UltraMix until like DDR spot

268
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:21,140
unloaded on everybody. So on UltraMix 3, here's the hint. Try it 3 times and maybe it'll work

269
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:26,140
because you know, with 1 you only had to do it once, 2, 2, so maybe 3 times. Anyway, uh,

270
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:34,580
V-Rare Tracklist was revealed for Xtreme 2, a bunch of fucking repeats basically, Destiny,

271
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:39,620
the piano version, Feelings Won't Fade, Extended Transmix, Midnight Blaze, System SF Mix, Can

272
00:21:39,620 --> 00:21:44,020
Be Real, Soulhouse Extended, Seduction, the vocal remix.

273
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:48,020
So basically a lot of shit you've pretty much heard before except we've got Yuzo Koshiro

274
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:53,300
with You've Gotta Move It, but otherwise you've got Sakura, Can Be Real, Colors, Infinite

275
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:58,980
prayer quickening under twa be lovin I need you love more lately yes I know the

276
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:05,180
seductions brand-new you know I'm sure it'll be a kick-butt v-rare and you

277

278
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:14,740
strum mania v2 is on its way blah blah blah blah blah DDR extreme won the video

279
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:18,780
music awards for best soundtrack but you didn't see it on the actual show because

280
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:23,180
it was one of those pre show awards they gave away in other words MTV doesn't

281
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:27,740
a shit about DDR. But that's okay, because I don't give a shit about MTV, so it works out.

282
00:22:29,260 --> 00:22:31,020
A few other things that I mentioned.

283
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:31,660
Alright, go for it.

284
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:38,540
Talking to Konami rep. In case you didn't know, there's gonna be a demo on the two new DDRs,

285
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:42,140
DDR Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, for Karaoke Revolution Pop.

286
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,940
Now, that's some juicy tidbit. I didn't know this. Say this.

287
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:52,860
And the same thing for Karaoke Revolution 4, or Party, or whatever. It's gonna be a

288
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,860
Demos for you know, whatever one vice-versa. That's I don't think we've I've heard this anywhere yet

289
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:02,120
So wow, our listeners just got a real juicy tidbit there

290
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:05,360
So if you were able to put up with a show at this point also was worth it

291
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,220
let me just say

292
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,860
well, I don't know if I can say anything but

293
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:15,620
Konami's gonna be spending more time in the courts. Let me just put that way. Ooh

294
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,340
Interesting so you made a new friend at Konami that told you all sorts of stuff didn't you? Yeah, he's my new friend

295
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:30,220
He's gonna send us actually the v-rares for Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 pretty soon. Very interesting. So we'll get the first tidbits on that

296
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:35,260
Oh, I'm excited. I'm hopefully Ultramix 3. He said whatever he has so stay tuned to Orange Lounge

297
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:41,580
But um, we got that and I got a ton of diverse system stuff. We've got you know, lots of fun stuff

298
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:46,300
All right, we're gonna play one song on this little special show. This is actually from not diverse system

299
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,820
this is from good good cool the ultra expander and

300
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:58,140
And, um, it's a remix of Absolute, the ultimate remix, and it definitely fits that title.

301
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:02,540
Alright, so here it is, we're gonna play this for you guys on the Orange Lounge Radio Not
