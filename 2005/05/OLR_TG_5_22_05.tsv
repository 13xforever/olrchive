265	3387	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 23rd, 2005.
3547	14334	You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.
14614	18116	Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
20518	23420	Hello, everybody, again from back home.
24602	27745	It's kind of nice to be back home, although E3 was pretty exciting.
27785	29606	It's very nice to be back home.
30427	34710	Welcome to our podcast, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, where we talk about games that don't suck.
34810	35671	My name is Rob Roberts.
35691	36572	You might know me as Sky.
37192	39414	Joining me is my co-host, Loki.
39994	40415	Hello.
40975	42777	And the other co-host, DarkSakura.
42837	47781	She is not here tonight because she is coming back from LA the day that we're taping this podcast.
47801	50343	She stayed a couple days extra so she could go to Disneyland and stuff.
51524	57387	We actually went a couple days early so we could go check out the More Friends concert, which happened on Monday night.
57427	59008	What did you think of the More Friends concert, Loki?
59208	63570	It was good, but it was littered with technical issues.
63670	64891	Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing.
64931	70394	A lot of sound problems, and I think whoever was behind arranging the sound and stuff for that show is going to get canned.
71195	76838	And the real too bad part is that it probably jeopardizes whether that is going to happen in the future or not.
76858	77978	It's kind of sad.
78179	78739	I almost feel like
79519	82500	because the audience reception was kind of lukewarm to it.
83060	86140	And it's too bad because they did some amazing things at the concert.
86160	96962	The opera scene that they did was great, and the Black Mages rocked, and that combination at the very end, they played one wing angel, combined the Black Mages and the orchestra and the choir.
97362	98122	It was amazing.
98282	98862	Exactly.
99162	104963	It's just kind of too bad that because of the sound issues, when I say sound issue, I mean like during like Eris' theme and stuff, when you hear that...
108649	110750	You'd hear these big popping noises and things like that.
110951	112572	Yeah, sound of stuff exploding.
112852	116034	Oh yeah, the MC's mic didn't work for some of it and a bunch of other stuff.
116074	116834	It's just too bad.
117115	118235	It was really sad.
118436	123379	But I mean, overall, it's nobody, no talent person's fault.
123499	124620	The orchestra was great.
124700	125620	The singers were great.
126581	129523	Uematsu and his band were awesome.
129603	130884	Overall, it was a good time.
130904	137828	It's just too bad that some bad sound department can really screw up a show like that and kind of make the whole thing look bad.
139029	140310	Thank you for watching!
156142	185179	and a laptop and now we're back to having our mixing board and our nicer microphones so we hope you guys enjoyed our podcast from E3 nonetheless we want to do it again next year hopefully do some interviews and things like that as well just as this podcast continues to grow and if you haven't checked it out yet subscribe to our podcast and catch up on your iPod or Doppler or whatever program you use catch up on the feeds and check it out or you can look at our portal on like Podcast Alley or Podcast Pickle any of those sites ought to have
185826	189049	A record of all the shows we have currently on file.
189269	189770	It's pretty cool.
190410	191831	All right, let's talk about our gaming week.
191871	194734	Well, obviously, we were at E3 most of the week.
194834	199498	But out of curiosity, was there any games that you played that wasn't at E3?
199578	201380	Something else maybe you played, Loki.
202761	207005	I played a lot of Rengoku Tower Purgatory.
207025	209587	And actually, the game kind of grew on me just because I figured out a way...
211833	213234	It's kind of good and bad for the game.
240666	243068	Say you have this one weapon, which is a double claw.
243088	248173	If you attach it to your arm, it's actually like a claw if you attach it to your head, it's almost like horns or something.
248953	261324	And so, I've been going through this game and just, you know, kind of basically like leveling up on each floor, but the problem is I figured out a way to level up so fast that I'm unstoppable now.
261424	265808	It's just, it's kind of a flaw in the game, but it makes it fun at the same time.
265928	267450	I don't really know how to describe it, but...
268363	277410	Right now I'm really powerful and I figured a way to kill everything like super quick and I guess, I don't know, but I don't really play much of the game.
277430	279592	There's not really much depth to it.
279672	283015	It's just kind of you go level to level and you rise up this tower.
283815	289880	I don't really know what the plot line is, but it's kind of fun and attaching all these different weapons to you and you have to think a little bit.
290180	292182	It's kind of like Armored Core in a sense, I guess.
292702	296966	But I was playing a lot of that and more Ridge Racer for the PSP and I was...
298066	298686	DX Download Station
324865	326706	to take Meteos back to the hotel.
327206	338731	And LankyStyle and myself, you might know him from some of the programs on Orange Launch Radio's live station, we actually played Meteos Versus because we both downloaded it from the DS download station.
338971	341072	We played Versus in the hotel room later on that night.
341602	342363	So much fun.
342923	343604	It's a great game.
345105	353072	I remember back on the podcast, I kind of was annoyed with the DS download station the first day because it was hard to get in there and get anything because it was always crowded.
353493	356615	But, you know, once you got in there and got something, it was a pretty neat concept.
356656	362781	And being able to put your DS to sleep, I wish I had still slept the damn thing and I could still have that Meteos demo, but.
363151	364872	I'll just have to wait until next week when the game comes out.
365432	366392	It's a great puzzler.
366532	372075	I'm so happy the DS... Honestly, the E3 really did restore my faith in the DS.
372235	377357	I'm so happy because really right now, there's not a lot of great stuff out for it, but there's so much good stuff on the horizon.
377377	378037	I'm very happy.
378057	382219	Nintendogs needs to be pushed up to say, I don't know, next week.
382839	385340	Seriously, but the last date we hear from Nintendogs I think was August 22nd.
385380	387121	Something like that.
387884	388084	E3, E3, E3, E3
413129	414649	Maybe 100,000, I don't know.
415089	419291	A little high, but 70,000 people attended this year's E3 Expo.
419311	423312	To put this into perspective a little bit for you guys, last year's E3 Expo was 58,000.
423832	428554	So that was 12,000 more people at E3 this year compared to last year.
429374	434175	The Los Angeles Convention Center is 547,000 square feet.
434996	439277	So if you think about putting 70,000 people in that, now granted they aren't always all there at once, but still,
439599	439739	E3 May 10-12, 2016
463900	465041	Oh, you're not going to be able to make it?
465321	470205	Well, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to make it because I'm getting married that Sunday before.
470265	472607	Well, that would be a good reason why you can't go.
472627	475248	Yeah, I don't think... I'm not even going to try pushing it.
475288	477410	I mean, that's just bad news.
477510	480632	Well, a very interesting story actually turned up on GameSpot.
480672	483174	You may not be the only one that doesn't get to go next year.
483214	484996	A very interesting article on GameSpot.
485696	489539	It's kind of a little bit of an interview with the show director, Mary Dolier.
489679	490900	I'm sorry if I mispronounced that there.
491440	491540	Um...
492361	495602	Talking about some changes that they want to make to the show.
495642	499483	And a lot of the article talks about should they make the show public.
499803	504964	And they don't really want to make the show public, even though there have been cries to do that for a long time.
504984	506805	But trust me, guys, it's crowded enough as it is.
508425	514006	And what the director said is, quote, the biggest headache is trying to keep the consumers from coming to the show.
514446	515807	Everyone feels that they should come.
515827	518487	And there's a number of people that will work at a retail outlet.
518787	521208	They'll get a job there and work there for two weeks and
521328	521768	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
543567	548811	So the director of the show is kind of aware of what's going on, so it'll be very interesting to see if there's any changes to next year's show.
549292	554776	They did reject their saying 16,000 people this year, so interesting.
557318	562643	And of course they're talking about that they will kind of re-evaluate things and see what they should do.
562983	565625	More credentials, that's all it really comes down to is just, you know,
566095	573879	Maybe instead of asking for one paste, maybe ask for the most recent paste or something like that, like one that's only a few weeks old or something.
574719	590167	The final word here in this article from the director, as far as the improvement side, we'll continually watch the registration and try to set policies and make sure that we're really letting in only the quality people and staff up with more registration people to make sure we keep it to just the people who should be here.
591148	591688	Very interesting.
593079	598203	So, unfortunately, if you guys are a little bummed that it's kind of hard to go to E3, it's going to get harder next year.
598223	604527	Well, it sucks, too, because now that you get in, but they want, like, oh, well, we have some of the consumers coming in, let's make it all media only.
604767	608850	I mean... Yeah, so we kind of complained about it earlier, so... Interesting.
609410	610932	So we'll see what happens with E3 next year.
610972	615875	Of course, there won't be any word on next year's E3 outside of the date until much later on.
616676	619857	So looking around the internet, there's some other stories that come up as well.
620777	624878	One thing that was interesting that wasn't at E3 this year was the Phantom Console.
624918	627999	Now remember that they had a huge booth last year?
628419	631600	They had a huge booth showing off the Phantom Console, and it was supposed to be this big thing.
631620	632960	You can download games online.
633360	637441	We heard rumors they were going to be there at E3 this year, but nope, nothing.
637481	638581	Say it with me, folks.
638801	639261	Vaporware.
639321	639682	Vaporware.
640482	641322	Vaporware.
642335	643259	An article on CNNMoney.com
648330	661321	The company believes, based on past performance, that there is a high likelihood that sufficient capital will not be available and many or all of these milestones will be missed and the launch date will again shift and or the company will go out of business.
661341	664444	There's no market for it anymore because all these new game consoles are coming out.
664884	665705	It's pretty much what it is.
666085	668988	You can download content, you can play games online with your friends.
669468	670349	They're just too late.
670569	674132	They did not get this console out fast enough and...
674907	677589	Even if they were to try to push it out now, it's going to be a failure.
678909	683592	I would say count your losses now and just don't release it.
683612	688155	Or maybe try to team up your technology with one of the folks that's going into this very soon.
688535	691057	Although I doubt something like that would happen.
691377	692137	I suppose you never know.
693358	695339	So there goes the Phantom console.
695719	697020	Not gone forever yet.
697200	700682	I'd love to take one of those because that would make a really cool case mod.
700762	701623	But, you know...
702754	706683	I granted they had a really cool the console look cool I mean
707532	710273	It's a lot better than, say, the Revolution.
710773	712093	At least the design of it.
712553	719235	Speaking of the Revolution, the Revolution was starting to feel like vaporware a little bit as well as E3 because we didn't see a whole lot on it.
719635	721535	We did get to see some early console designs.
722135	728497	They are promising that they will reveal more details about the Revolution by the end of this year, which makes sense.
728517	729517	They're going to have to, really.
730617	734658	One thing that did happen is that the company's Japanese site for Nintendo...
735118	756285	Actually released some new images of the revolution and it actually shows the revolution in some different colors Including, I'm bringing this picture up in studio right now so look you can see this There's actually black and white and then there's like this pinkish color And this really like barfy yellow color that the revolution is supposed to be coming in Very interesting, hmm?
757247	758968	That doesn't look like a Nintendo console to me.
759009	760029	It looks like a PS2.
760089	761611	It looks like a disk drive.
761671	762411	It's so weird.
762572	765414	It looks like a micro ITX PC case.
765534	768016	And honestly, there are micro ITX PC cases.
769297	770058	That's the thing.
770418	771279	It's a box.
771940	773621	Ooh, it's a box with a glowing CD drive.
773881	776183	Wow, you went out on a limb to make that one.
776463	779686	Well, we can't knock the system until we get more details.
779706	780827	I'm knocking it right now.
781027	782028	It looks ugly.
782168	783750	It's just like you didn't...
784250	784891	Spend any time.
784951	790256	Okay, granted the PlayStation 3 isn't much better, but at least it looks sleek and it looks nice.
790356	792979	Like it's something you'd want to have in your house because it looks cool.
793379	797383	The Revolution looks like something I'm going to shove next to my VCR because it's small.
798348	814802	What's interesting is that also what you can notice on the console from these screenshots is you can actually see a flip top that will reveal some GameCube style controller ports as well as GameCube memory card slots, which makes sense if this is going to be a backwards compatible system.
815082	817284	They need to have this somewhere on the system as well.
818445	823529	Also, the system is supposed to have, of course, as we already know, wireless controls and an internal flash memory.
823905	828610	So this stuff is all kind of extra, but there's that flip top there, Loki, if you haven't seen that yet.
828630	829431	That's kind of cool.
829491	829832	Yeah.
829872	831454	Now, see, now one little cool thing.
831934	832275	Yeah.
832595	834097	Well, that's kind of cool that it's on there.
834117	835138	It still looks like a box.
837420	837701	All right.
837721	840344	So we'll hopefully see a little more on the Nintendo Revolution later on.
840404	842166	But that'll be cool for case spotting.
843085	844926	Didn't you have something on Nintendo Revolution you wanted to share?
845266	845646	Oh, no.
845826	846527	It's a couple things.
846687	852930	First, there was an article that came out that was saying, oh, the Revolution's going to be able to run homebrew code on it.
852970	853670	Everyone's excited.
853790	854891	Oh, yay, homebrew code.
855251	858432	Then there's another article that came out that said, no, you're not going to be able to run homebrew code.
858452	863555	In fact, there's going to be a new digital rights management thing in place where it'll be impossible for you to run homebrew code.
863635	868057	And impossible, of course, meaning that it will take a little bit more time to run homebrew code on it.
869826	872388	It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen, honestly.
872748	873729	And you know what's funny?
873909	881173	Last night I was trying to download the full videos for... Remember that Revolution thing that was out with the video and everything?
881994	884035	It's very interesting, that whole video.
884075	885336	The fan video you're talking about?
885376	885716	The fan one.
885756	886717	Okay, the fan-made video.
886777	890679	Well, it's got that case design, though, in it.
890859	895602	And I don't know when that video came out, but it's got that same case design with the other thing.
896288	896829	DarkSakura, DarkSakura
917640	930438	somebody goes to E3 and this happened to me last year too it's like there's something you completely freaking missed at the show and you're like how did I miss this I walked the show floor like four times and I somehow completely missed this well I feel embarrassed that I missed this one
930933	931393	But you know what?
931413	935955	There's so much stuff that goes on at E3 that sometimes, you know, you just miss the most obvious things.
936315	938315	There's actually a brand new Mario Bros.
938375	944177	game coming to the DS, and I don't mean some Mario franchise, you know, Mario Baseball, Mario DDR, whatever.
944257	946278	I'm talking a Mario Bros.
946378	948799	side-scroll game is coming out for the DS.
949319	949759	I saw that.
950299	950959	What did you think of this?
951039	952480	I didn't hear you bring this up on the podcast.
952500	953060	It looked dumb.
953560	953880	Really?
954901	955761	How did it look dumb?
956101	958782	Because it's Mario... The screenshots I saw looked pretty sweet.
959878	964482	It just reminded me of like Paper Mario.
964522	965603	I don't like Paper Mario.
966764	973849	I've always been bitter with Paper Mario because it's not Mario RPG and they want to say it's Mario RPG 2 and it's... No.
974390	982056	But anyways, no, it's just... If they're going to do a new Mario game, it's got to be old school like graphics, 2D, that type of thing.
982076	984978	But that's kind of what they're going for is what it looked like.
985058	985839	I'll see.
985899	988922	The only other cool thing I thought is have you like...
989969	991350	If you remember Super Smash Bros.
991390	996592	Melee, there's like that stage where you actually kind of play like Mario when you're going through like the adventure mode or something like that.
996972	997812	That was cool.
998032	998753	That was so cool.
999053	1004135	Like they should make an entire like GameCube Mario in that regard, but we'll see.
1005680	1006861	I guess maybe we're just wishing.
1007321	1009002	Well, whatever.
1009362	1017587	One big surprise at the show about the Xbox 360, Square Enix is hopping on board because Final Fantasy XI will be released for the Xbox 360.
1017968	1023151	Rumor was that it was going to have graphic upgrades, but apparently those rumors are actually being shot down.
1023171	1025953	It will not have graphic upgrades in it.
1025993	1027113	It's going to be the same thing.
1027514	1028514	But here's the deal.
1028754	1031356	I think this is really what it is, if you think about it.
1031958	1035815	If you play on the PS2, you're playing in like 640x480 low-res mode.
1037677	1039237	But it looks fine on a TV.
1039297	1041758	But if you play that same mode on a computer, it looks a little choppy.
1042278	1043219	But it looks fine on TV.
1043639	1047440	I imagine what they're doing with the Xbox is it's just like playing it on a high-end PC.
1048240	1052701	And when you port that to a television set, it looks really, really clean.
1053061	1054382	So I imagine that's just what it is.
1054422	1055222	It's just a high-end computer.
1055282	1055882	It's all it is.
1055902	1059123	It's going to be because it's HDTV compatible.
1059203	1060703	So it's going to be high-end graphics.
1061023	1065104	But it's not going to exceed that of the actual PC version.
1065164	1067085	It's just some difference.
1067461	1074826	Some other questions were answered at a press conference that Square Enix held after the show in regards to Final Fantasy XI, among with some other Square Enix games.
1075206	1080630	Final Fantasy XI will use the same servers on the Xbox 360 as the PC or PS2.
1081030	1083772	Rumors are going around to the contrary, but they put those to rest.
1084693	1087454	So you will play on the same servers that everyone else plays on.
1087495	1093679	So it'll be, I think, the first game to be cross-server across three different platforms, I think.
1094239	1094539	Maybe.
1094599	1094879	Maybe.
1095740	1097262	Final Fantasy XII was not playable at E3.
1097282	1103871	They claim it was an issue of timing, but they are saying they will have it playable at the end of July in some type of private setting.
1115259	1120543	So I think our rumors that we completely made up about the fact that it's being pushed for PlayStation 3 are false.
1120623	1121885	It will come out on PS2.
1122425	1125768	But I'll tell you what, it looks damn good.
1125868	1135035	I mean, honestly, the movie we saw inside the Square Enix Theater, when you see this thing, you would have a hard time believing it's PS2 as well.
1135055	1135716	It looks very good.
1138079	1143481	Square Enix will be dubbing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children in English when they release it here in America.
1144921	1150423	No word yet if they will do it in Japanese with English subtitles as well, like another option on the DVD.
1150483	1151743	I'm sure it will be.
1151963	1155664	Well, the best answer they got was a we will consider the possibility.
1156084	1156904	They didn't get a yes.
1158105	1158365	Hmm.
1158665	1158845	Hmm.
1160549	1166453	World of Mana was a game that was teased at E3, but really no additional information outside of that.
1166493	1169195	I remember seeing a trailer for it, but it really didn't show anything.
1169255	1171917	Just that, ooh, a new Mana game is going to come out, right?
1172197	1172377	Yeah.
1172497	1174919	Or Seiken Densetsu, for those of you purists.
1175639	1178701	No idea what system it's on or if it's going to be.
1178721	1182944	When I heard World of Mana, I thought it was going to be an MMO, but no idea yet.
1182964	1183665	Yeah.
1185214	1194038	So basically what they're trying to do with the World of Mana is that they're going to try and release this across multiple platforms at once.
1194139	1199341	When I say multiple platforms, I mean they want to do films with it, novels, manga, other things.
1199601	1202623	So kind of interesting what they want to do with that.
1202823	1204584	So we'll have to see how this game turns out.
1206004	1210907	But we might not only get a World of Mana game, but an anime and all sorts of other things as well.
1211667	1212528	Game Boy Color Emulator
1234797	1262488	version 1.141 was released still only playable on version 1 PSPs but however there is some information saying that they think they might have found a way to get it to work on 1.5s which are all the US versions so you'll have to check that out other things I should mention about the PSP is Gamma Pack for the was it Wipeout Pure was released
1262892	1265953	This week I downloaded it, I checked it out, and I didn't care.
1266093	1272594	Because it was like one track and a couple new... I've just kind of given up on Wipeout Pure.
1272855	1274775	I just use it for the browser hacks.
1276395	1277116	It's interesting.
1277556	1285138	Also, I forgot to mention, I got to play online using the infrastructure mode in the PSP.
1285158	1289039	So over the internet, I got to play Twisted Metal head-on with some other people.
1289119	1290179	And that was pretty interesting.
1290219	1290659	No lag.
1291175	1318936	but people were dropping out of the rooms like crazy so it kind of sucked but it's funny enough that people are using Twisted Metal head-on more for chat than anything because there's actually like chat rooms so I thought that was funny speaking of chat on portable gaming systems one thing we didn't go into too much detail on our podcast from E3 about was the voice over IP thing that they were showing off at Nintendo's booth kind of interesting different interesting speaking of voice over IP stuff um
1319887	1327250	There's actually a guy that was working as actually part of a voice over IP company.
1327950	1342857	And he's saying, CEO Eric Lagerwey from X10, it's like a VoIP phone company, he's trying to get his software to run on a PSP.
1343197	1345998	So he's trying to get voice over IP chat for the PSP.
1346458	1348379	Hmm, something new coming to handhelds.
1349292	1354134	Speaking of handhelds, one thing that kind of surprised people at the show was the Gizmondo.
1355055	1357336	That was a brand new system coming out from Tiger.
1357996	1361738	And what they're trying to do with this, it's already available in Europe, but it's going to be coming out here.
1362699	1366120	Not only will it play games, but it's supposed to do movies and music.
1366581	1368542	And of course you kind of think, well so can my PSP.
1368602	1371223	But then also it does pictures with a built-in camera.
1371636	1376417	and you can send it to other Gizmondo users and other mobile phone users as well.
1376477	1378858	It also has a built-in GPS system in it.
1379298	1380058	Kind of interesting.
1380218	1381379	Bluetooth in it as well.
1382159	1383819	Did you get a chance to check out the Gizmondo?
1383839	1384700	A little bit.
1384880	1393882	When I went by the booth, it was so loud over there and I couldn't handle it because it was kind of enclosed and they had some performance going on over there and it was crowded.
1394264	1397007	So I didn't really get to see too much of the system, but it looked interesting.
1397348	1400612	I was already more interested in it than I was in, say, The Engage.
1401092	1404736	So that's something good for it right there.
1405477	1406719	Didn't you check out one of the games?
1406779	1409722	I tried out the one music game that they had there.
1410864	1411665	It was interesting.
1413146	1413507	I don't know.
1413527	1414188	It was kind of...
1416209	1418230	The load time on it was killer.
1418411	1420072	It was just like, oh my god.
1420092	1423194	The load time was pretty bad, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.
1423734	1426856	Do you think the Gizmondo stands a chance against things like the DS and the PSP?
1427337	1427657	Maybe.
1428077	1430699	It definitely stands a chance against, they say, the N-Gage.
1431707	1434389	And I think it's got some pretty good stuff for it.
1434469	1439152	I don't know if it's got phone capability with the games, Mondo, but it's got a camera built into it, so that's kind of neat.
1439893	1441434	And the interface wasn't that bad.
1442454	1443635	The game was pretty cool.
1443835	1450360	I just couldn't hear much of it because the sound wasn't working too well because the people were rapping like four feet away from me.
1451928	1459431	But if they fix the load time issue, I assume that just because it was a demo, they have a huge load time, because that thing loaded for a good five minutes.
1460872	1462212	That's unacceptable.
1462612	1472376	I assume, because it's probably not finished, that's probably the case, but if that's what is going to be the final version, then no, I would not recommend it.
1472416	1474857	But otherwise, it looks like it would be pretty cool.
1477492	1481836	Some little controversies going on at E3 in regards to some of the conferences.
1481896	1485319	It seems like a lot of folks were not impressed with the big three's conferences this year.
1485719	1496869	Microsoft, many claims coming out that they had plants in the audience that would sit there and act all enthusiastically and that the media was kind of just not amused with it, you know, that Microsoft had plants in the audience.
1497469	1498130	One rumor there.
1498750	1504035	PS3 rumor going around that some of their videos that they were claiming were real-time were actually pre-rendered videos.
1504820	1506442	some of the materials they showed from Killzone 2.
1506482	1514111	Well, yeah, because now the PS3's graphics and stuff are so good, it does look like pre-rendered video, but it's not.
1514191	1519638	And they showed, I mean, I was looking at some of the conference stuff that they were showing, there's not
1520273	1534710	You know, there's no way that they're saying that's pre-rendered video, because they're showing, like, real-time, the guys moving the stuff around, taking, like, a model of the one guy who played Dr. Octopus, and adjusting the light and stuff, and they modeled the room and stuff, and
1535902	1536803	There's no way.
1537423	1541105	They're showing live footage of that, and there's no way.
1542106	1542426	Interesting.
1543046	1550231	And then just an overall general sigh at Nintendo's conference this year that really their ace in the hole is Zelda Twilight Princess, and that's about it.
1551171	1553833	Not a whole lot of details on Revolution and the Game Boy Micro.
1554633	1555354	Not that impressive.
1555374	1557255	How are you supposed to read text on that thing, huh?
1558135	1561998	If you want to play a Pokemon game, you've got to get out your magnifying glass, rather.
1564403	1565944	and try to read some of the text on that thing.
1586956	1591197	It seems like something... Are they trying to design something that people want to put on their keychains and stuff?
1591257	1592197	Is that what it is?
1592477	1596758	I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to make another... They're trying to make it a music player, too.
1597098	1599098	Because apparently it has a music player add-on to it.
1599399	1600299	Oh, that would be interesting.
1600399	1602119	But, you know... Stop!
1603499	1607600	Leave the music business for the people that want to do the music business, like the iPods and stuff.
1608380	1611441	Why does, you know, Microsoft and Nintendo...
1612085	1614787	and Sony have to try to get in on that music.
1615047	1615347	Stop.
1615467	1617629	Well, because the music thing is truly a revolution right now.
1617669	1621191	We're moving from a CD age to a digital age and everybody wants a piece of it.
1622112	1622772	That's dumb.
1622832	1624733	The poor guys get left in the dust.
1624873	1625974	But here's the problem.
1626014	1629596	We're going to make these console systems that can do everything but gaming.
1631117	1631778	That's the problem.
1632178	1634860	Oh, but it plays DVDs and it plays your iPod.
1635160	1637322	Yeah, but the games suck.
1637942	1640844	Yeah, they look pretty, but they suck.
1642018	1644599	I'm afraid that's what we're going to run into.
1644619	1649661	Because I can tell you this much, I've played a few games at E3 that looked good, but they sucked.
1651041	1651781	How's that work?
1652081	1654982	Oh, they look pretty, but they're just not fun.
1655262	1655642	Like what?
1655722	1656103	Name one.
1656323	1656483	L.A.
1656543	1656803	Rush.
1656923	1661644	In order to play that game, you have to actually look at the map because it's so detailed and stuff.
1662225	1666466	There's no indicator where you're supposed to go, so you kind of have to find your own path through the checkpoints.
1666486	1666606	Mm-hmm.
1667173	1668114	Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1695655	1696195	It's not fun.
1696215	1698536	Alright, well that's the last story I have.
1698576	1700316	Do you have anything else?
1714199	1715219	I have nothing.
1715279	1719181	I'm looking more into that Nintendo Revolution video and I couldn't find anything.
1719341	1719641	All right.
1719701	1723642	Well, more E3 Fallout to come on our next podcast and et cetera, et cetera.
1724923	1728344	And we'll be here with you guys until later.
1728544	1728904	Oh, yeah.
1728944	1734706	I forgot to mention also I bought Smart Bomb and I played it and I cannot recommend that game to anyone.
1734726	1735827	The load times are long.
1736207	1737087	It's frustrating.
1737107	1738328	It makes you want to throw the PSP.
1739068	1739508	Don't buy it.
1740148	1740408	All right.
1740589	1741329	That was a little random.
1741349	1741809	That's all right.
1743012	1745133	Any other random final thoughts that you might have?
1746254	1746894	No, that's it.
1747855	1754438	All right, and I guess my final thought would be send us email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
1754558	1763683	Or did you know if you want to address one of us specifically, you can write Matt at orangeloungeradio.com, Jamie at orangeloungeradio.com, or myself, Rob at orangeloungeradio.com.
1764283	1765544	We're here for you.
1766904	1770386	But our general show email is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.
1770925	1773466	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
1773486	1775788	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com
1800066	1801017	See you next update!
