1
00:00:23,305 --> 00:00:27,569
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at what you see in the face, the mirror of your dreams.

2
00:00:27,589 --> 00:00:30,932
Make believe I'm a hero, hidden in the light, written on the pages.

3
00:01:21,062 --> 00:01:24,368
Keep the secret, we'll fall behind the clouds And dance among the rainbows

4
00:02:48,488 --> 00:02:49,155
Thanks for watching!

5
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:03,575

[SPEAKER_14]: On tonight's program, Orange Lounge Radio, episode 143.

7
00:04:20,982 --> 00:04:24,764
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back from E3, and oh my gosh, it was a hell of a show.

8
00:04:25,624 --> 00:04:27,865
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course, lots of people there.

9
00:04:27,885 --> 00:04:31,507
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to push your way through crowds and stomp all over people to get to things.

10
00:04:31,527 --> 00:04:34,849
[SPEAKER_14]: You had to wait three freaking hours in line if you wanted to play Zelda.

11
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:38,931
[SPEAKER_14]: And unfortunately, not all the cast members made it out alive.

12
00:04:39,691 --> 00:04:40,091
[SPEAKER_14]: Alive.

13
00:04:40,331 --> 00:04:43,872
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, unfortunately not all of us made it out of E3 alive.

14
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:47,813
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we'll have more details on all of that when we come back.

15
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:53,374
[SPEAKER_14]: But I'll tell you what, tonight it is all about the music games at E3 and it was a hell of a show.

16
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:58,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Surprises that just blew the roof off and smacked you up.

17
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:03,616
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll talk more about that when we start the show after these opening credits.

18
00:05:04,076 --> 00:05:04,516
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back.

37
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:36,878
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding, she's actually not here tonight.

38
00:07:37,518 --> 00:07:39,799
[SPEAKER_13]: She died at E3, it's so sad!

39
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:43,781
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding, she didn't die at E3.

40
00:07:44,721 --> 00:08:08,703
[SPEAKER_14]: She just, she extended her vacation a little bit You see, some of us went to E3 a couple days before it started And some of us decided to stay a couple days after it was over So, Jamie is on her way back this afternoon, or I'm sorry, this evening actually from LA So, she's not here, but who is here is the one and only Loki I am here and I have pizza, that's always good

41
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,878
[SPEAKER_12]: I did slash pizza and I got my Pizza Hut.

42
00:08:12,618 --> 00:08:18,921
[SPEAKER_12]: By slash pizza it means I drove my car over to the Taco Bell slash Pizza Hut Express and got myself pizza.

43
00:08:19,221 --> 00:08:20,321
[SPEAKER_12]: The old-fashioned way.

44
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:22,742
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the EverQuest way.

45
00:08:23,162 --> 00:08:23,563
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, hell no.

46
00:08:23,583 --> 00:08:26,184
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not going to sign up for EverQuest just to get that lazy.

47
00:08:26,444 --> 00:08:28,665
[SPEAKER_12]: Besides, there's no Pizza Hut near my house and that makes me sad.

48
00:08:28,945 --> 00:08:31,946
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, speaking of EverQuest, this is completely off the subject, but...

49
00:08:32,811 --> 00:08:39,758
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually got to meet some of our quote-unquote competitors, although not really, because, you know, all of us online radio stations are in it together.

50
00:08:39,778 --> 00:08:40,859
[SPEAKER_12]: People in the same industry.

51
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, people in the same industry.

52
00:08:42,441 --> 00:08:54,493
[SPEAKER_14]: I met the folks from MMO Radio, who talk about nothing but EverQuest and, what are the other, I don't even know, World of Warcraft and Guild Wars and all those types of games 24-7, so...

53
00:08:56,897 --> 00:09:04,935
[SPEAKER_14]: If you think it's weird that there's stations out there dedicated to DDR Just know that there's other stations out there dedicated to other types of games Anyway

54
00:09:06,132 --> 00:09:07,933
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a fun show for you guys tonight.

55
00:09:08,554 --> 00:09:09,514
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just me and Loki.

56
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:11,075
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually don't have any other guests tonight.

57
00:09:11,216 --> 00:09:14,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I know Rice Princess is actually here around.

58
00:09:14,398 --> 00:09:17,940
[SPEAKER_14]: She's watching movies with my roommate though, so I don't know if we'll be able to get her on.

59
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,441
[SPEAKER_13]: She's watching Fargo.

60
00:09:19,541 --> 00:09:20,502
[SPEAKER_14]: Are they watching Fargo?

61
00:09:20,542 --> 00:09:22,743
[SPEAKER_14]: Why are they watching Fargo of all things?

62
00:09:23,044 --> 00:09:27,366
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess they want to, I don't know, watch someone get thrown through a wood chip.

63
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:30,028
[SPEAKER_14]: How about watching a movie that wasn't really overrated?

64
00:09:30,348 --> 00:09:31,089
[SPEAKER_14]: That sounds like fun.

65
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:35,761
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we're going to take a quick break.

66
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:40,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Of course we've got lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of E3 news to talk about tonight.

67
00:09:40,965 --> 00:09:44,528
[SPEAKER_14]: But we're going to start off with a quick break.

68
00:09:45,129 --> 00:09:49,352
[SPEAKER_14]: And in this break we're going to feature some music that was made big at last year's E3.

69
00:09:50,352 --> 00:09:50,573
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

70
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:51,433
[SPEAKER_14]: From songs.

71
00:09:51,794 --> 00:09:57,818
[SPEAKER_14]: But what is neat about tonight, you guys, is that do we have songs from the new mixes?

72
00:09:58,639 --> 00:09:58,939
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

73
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:03,679
[SPEAKER_14]: We have one new song to play for you guys from EX2.

74
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:08,903
[SPEAKER_14]: And we have a bootleg copy of a song from Ultramix 3.

75
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:09,763
[SPEAKER_14]: This is too cool.

76
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:11,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't wait to hear how this turns out.

77
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,786
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back with more details on that after this.

78
00:10:13,886 --> 00:10:15,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Started off with a little bit of your reign.

79
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:15,667
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back.

80
00:10:31,104 --> 00:10:33,043
Thanks for watching!

81
00:11:31,459 --> 00:11:33,346
My resistance is waning

82
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:01,069
Thank you for watching!

83
00:16:54,645 --> 00:16:55,625
[SPEAKER_11]: Gaming Radio.

84
00:16:55,865 --> 00:17:00,826
[SPEAKER_11]: So uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

85
00:17:03,307 --> 00:17:04,647
[SPEAKER_11]: Orange Lounge Radio.

86
00:17:07,228 --> 00:17:07,828
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, everybody.

87
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:09,728
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back on Orange Lounge Radio.

88
00:17:09,768 --> 00:17:14,329
[SPEAKER_14]: In that break, arguably one of the best remixes ever done for DDR.

89
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Midi Head, in my eyes.

90
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:24,231
[SPEAKER_14]: Before that, Junior Senior, Move Your Feet, Elvis Rubberneckin from Ultramix 2, and the Kiriyama Oka with Your Rain, the Rage Mix from...

91
00:17:25,017 --> 00:17:27,059
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Extreme USA

92
00:17:54,181 --> 00:17:56,262
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we have a lot of E3 to talk about tonight.

93
00:17:56,302 --> 00:17:57,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Just Loki and I here tonight.

94
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,682
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura has the night off.

95
00:17:59,702 --> 00:18:01,563
[SPEAKER_14]: She's on her way back from LA right now.

96
00:18:01,643 --> 00:18:04,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Her and some folks from DRFreak went over to Disneyland yesterday.

97
00:18:06,384 --> 00:18:17,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I was actually originally going to go with them, but I had to back out at the last minute, basically, because I'm in a bit of a financial situation right now, so I couldn't afford to go to Disneyland, amongst some other things going on.

98
00:18:17,127 --> 00:18:17,827
[SPEAKER_14]: You're better off.

99
00:18:17,907 --> 00:18:19,007
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's overrated.

100
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:20,681
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so...

101
00:18:43,891 --> 00:18:50,214
[SPEAKER_14]: How about a little bit of how was your week, how was your day, except for the fact that we're going to talk about E3 a little later.

102
00:18:50,274 --> 00:18:53,896
[SPEAKER_14]: So is there anything you want to share outside of E3 for how was your week, how was your day?

103
00:18:53,956 --> 00:18:54,356
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki?

104
00:18:54,456 --> 00:18:58,738
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, let's start off with, first off, we drove down there.

105
00:18:58,959 --> 00:19:00,739
[SPEAKER_12]: That was eight hours of fun.

106
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:08,303
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we got there and we went and saw the More Friends concert.

107
00:19:08,323 --> 00:19:13,606
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, More Friends, More Music from Final Fantasy.

108
00:19:14,207 --> 00:19:16,408
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Snap, Crackle, and Poppin' Fun.

109
00:19:16,869 --> 00:19:17,789
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it was.

110
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:21,211
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's the best way to describe the concert, was Snap, Crackle, Pop.

111
00:19:21,272 --> 00:19:21,872
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a good one.

112
00:19:21,992 --> 00:19:22,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Let's just put it this way, okay?

113
00:19:23,053 --> 00:19:29,517
[SPEAKER_12]: If you were to have, like, say, I don't know, they had complete retards working their audio.

114
00:19:29,837 --> 00:19:30,557
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what it was.

115
00:19:31,218 --> 00:19:35,621
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, the singers would be singing, you can't hear them, or the mics wouldn't be turned on.

116
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:39,823
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like they honestly got some tech guy out of high school to do it.

117
00:19:40,844 --> 00:19:42,585
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it was awful.

118
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,081
[SPEAKER_12]: As far as audio goes, it was cool.

119
00:19:45,741 --> 00:19:51,824
[SPEAKER_12]: The Black Mages were cool and everything, but it just wasn't mixed right and it didn't sound good at all.

120
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:57,187
[SPEAKER_12]: Especially at the end where they combined the rock band with the orchestra with the choir.

121
00:19:57,908 --> 00:19:59,268
[SPEAKER_12]: It just drowned out everything.

122
00:19:59,368 --> 00:20:00,589
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just awful.

123
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,951
[SPEAKER_12]: In that sense, but it was a cool concert.

124
00:20:05,312 --> 00:20:09,994
[SPEAKER_12]: And then we went to Arcade Infinity and I played the tambourine game, except it sucked.

125
00:20:10,447 --> 00:20:16,910
[SPEAKER_12]: Only because they didn't have the thing on the floor where it told you where to stand, so I couldn't tell where the sensors were, so I, you know, kept losing.

126
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:21,212
[SPEAKER_12]: But I got to play Night of Fire on tambourines, and I looked like a complete dumbass.

127
00:20:21,372 --> 00:20:25,034
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just me or is the tambourine game the gayest game ever made?

128
00:20:25,314 --> 00:20:26,395
[SPEAKER_14]: And I can say that because I am gay.

129
00:20:27,075 --> 00:20:33,998
[SPEAKER_12]: It's exactly like some of the Amigo, it's just... But I mean, don't you look a little bit fruity playing that game?

130
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:35,519
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess...

131
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:38,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Trust me, I looked over.

132
00:20:38,411 --> 00:20:39,913
[SPEAKER_14]: You looked pretty fruity playing that game.

133
00:20:40,354 --> 00:20:40,834
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess.

134
00:20:41,395 --> 00:20:43,657
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, okay, I had played Dance Maniacs all day.

135
00:20:43,858 --> 00:20:45,339
[SPEAKER_12]: I had to get my Dance Maniacs fill.

136
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:53,649
[SPEAKER_12]: And after my hands started hurting from hitting the damn sensors on accident, I decided to just go ahead and play the tambourine game since it was there, you know, try it out.

137
00:20:55,718 --> 00:20:57,439
[SPEAKER_12]: And no, it wasn't good.

138
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,220
[SPEAKER_14]: It sucked.

139
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:29,209
[SPEAKER_12]: The one heavy metal song that was in that.

140
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,592
[SPEAKER_14]: The only one I remember I actually really like.

141
00:21:31,632 --> 00:21:32,252
[SPEAKER_14]: I hate to admit this.

142
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,734
[SPEAKER_14]: I really like the Vanilla Ninja song that's in Guitar Freaks.

143
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:35,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I need to copy it.

144
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:35,775
[SPEAKER_12]: I played that too.

145
00:21:35,955 --> 00:21:36,216
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

146
00:21:36,776 --> 00:21:40,439
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, the heavy metal one that was completely obnoxious.

147
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,641
[SPEAKER_12]: I played that about three times.

148
00:21:42,521 --> 00:21:43,082
[SPEAKER_12]: Really loud.

149
00:21:43,122 --> 00:21:45,884
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the Guitar Freaks there is really loud.

150
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:48,086
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just extremely loud.

151
00:21:48,126 --> 00:21:53,191
[SPEAKER_12]: It's so unexpected coming from playing at Golf Land where everything's quiet.

152
00:21:54,224 --> 00:21:54,584
[SPEAKER_14]: Pappa Music Yo-Ha

153
00:22:22,071 --> 00:22:29,234
[SPEAKER_14]: So, finally I figured out the only way you can really pick from any song is you have to go into challenge mode, but that just kind of ticked me off that I lost a dollar because I didn't know better.

154
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:31,175
[SPEAKER_14]: I also played a game of 2DX Red.

155
00:22:31,215 --> 00:22:32,156
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you play any 2DX Red?

156
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:33,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope, don't play 2DX.

157
00:22:33,176 --> 00:22:35,217
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, well.

158
00:22:35,557 --> 00:22:36,518
[SPEAKER_14]: It was fun, I guess.

159
00:22:36,898 --> 00:22:39,479
[SPEAKER_14]: I was able to play Injection of Love, and that made me happy, so.

160
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:42,641
[SPEAKER_12]: What else did I play?

161
00:22:44,882 --> 00:22:45,482
[SPEAKER_12]: Nothing really.

162
00:22:46,062 --> 00:22:49,724
[SPEAKER_12]: They had taken out my Gal's Panic game from AI, so that made me sad.

163
00:22:50,525 --> 00:22:51,165
[SPEAKER_12]: And, um...

164
00:22:52,708 --> 00:22:55,931
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, really, that was all I played is Dance Maniacs and Guitar Freaks there.

165
00:22:56,691 --> 00:23:02,656
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't care to touch Poppin' Music just because, I mean, honestly, why are they making Poppin' Music 13?

166
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:06,399
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, it's the same fucking game all over.

167
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,521
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, oh, look, we changed it now.

168
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,562
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a different theme.

169
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:10,823
[SPEAKER_12]: It's got a... It's the same game.

170
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:16,427
[SPEAKER_14]: It's got a rabid fan base and apparently it's still doing very well in Japan, so... I don't get it.

171
00:23:16,527 --> 00:23:17,268
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't know what to tell you.

172
00:23:17,288 --> 00:23:18,549
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't get it.

173
00:23:19,895 --> 00:23:20,816
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

174
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:47,772
[SPEAKER_12]: To go to Hooters to eat.

175
00:23:48,652 --> 00:23:50,573
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess they were taping the Jimmy Kimmel show or something.

176
00:23:50,913 --> 00:23:54,455
[SPEAKER_14]: And just all these people were out there because, you know, free Audioslave concert.

177
00:23:54,775 --> 00:24:01,479
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm going to be honest, guys, I didn't even know who Audioslave was, really, until I looked up and the guy was singing Spoon Man.

178
00:24:01,519 --> 00:24:03,780
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was like, oh, it's the guy from Soundgarden.

179
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,920
[SPEAKER_14]: He must have like a new band.

180
00:24:05,221 --> 00:24:06,461
[SPEAKER_14]: And finally I figured it out.

181
00:24:06,481 --> 00:24:07,182
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, how sad is that?

182
00:24:07,242 --> 00:24:11,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently their new album came out that day and they were promoting it.

183
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:11,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, okay.

184
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:13,225
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, that's what I read.

185
00:24:13,325 --> 00:24:13,905
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, I get it.

186
00:24:14,841 --> 00:24:17,663
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, so we had to fight our way through a crowd so that we could go to Hooters.

187
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:22,006
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they don't have Hooters in Sacramento, so it's a big deal for us to get to go to Hooters.

188
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,087
[SPEAKER_12]: It was Hooterific.

189
00:24:24,007 --> 00:24:26,149
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, what's the big deal with Hooters?

190
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:35,415
[SPEAKER_14]: I know I don't like to talk about local stuff a lot, but they're making a big stink about putting a Hooters here in Sacramento because they're saying, you know, oh, it's going to corrupt the children, no, no, no.

191
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:36,672
[SPEAKER_14]: What's the big deal?

192
00:24:36,692 --> 00:24:39,695
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen bigger whore waitresses at Chili's than I saw at Hooters.

193
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:45,259
[SPEAKER_12]: If you want to talk about big whores selling burgers, look at the new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr.

194
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:45,839
[SPEAKER_12]: commercial.

195
00:24:45,879 --> 00:24:46,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Come on.

196
00:24:46,300 --> 00:25:01,211
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh man, I can't believe that she's just like, did you know, and I'm not sure if you're aware of this, that's actually going to be on TV, and I saw this last night before they were, you know how they have the commercials before the movies and stuff?

197
00:25:01,611 --> 00:25:05,694
[SPEAKER_12]: They were trailering, get this, it was I Want to Be a Hilton.

198
00:25:06,112 --> 00:25:12,655
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be a new reality show where the mother is actually going to try to, like, it's refining, making them refine.

199
00:25:12,675 --> 00:25:15,017
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm like, yeah, and like your daughter's really refined.

200
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:17,258
[SPEAKER_12]: Refined and proper, my ass.

201
00:25:18,418 --> 00:25:21,400
[SPEAKER_12]: So, yeah, it's going to be a new reality show coming to TV.

202
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,600
[SPEAKER_12]: That's crap.

203
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,382
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish the Hiltons would just disappear, honestly.

204
00:25:25,742 --> 00:25:26,182
[SPEAKER_12]: All of them.

205
00:25:26,462 --> 00:25:27,623
[SPEAKER_12]: Your hotels aren't that good.

206
00:25:27,663 --> 00:25:28,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Get affected by aliens.

207
00:25:28,864 --> 00:25:30,084
[SPEAKER_12]: Their hotels are not that good.

208
00:25:30,344 --> 00:25:32,065
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I stayed in the Hilton once.

209
00:25:32,105 --> 00:25:32,605
[SPEAKER_14]: It was nice.

210
00:25:33,939 --> 00:25:37,321
[SPEAKER_14]: All the celebrity sightings this year were from far away.

211
00:25:37,381 --> 00:25:41,583
[SPEAKER_14]: In combination of everybody that was in our group, I think we saw Gary Coleman...

212
00:26:01,385 --> 00:26:02,265
[SPEAKER_12]: Sinbad again.

213
00:26:03,326 --> 00:26:07,007
[SPEAKER_12]: We saw Jason Mewes and the Waynes Brothers.

214
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:09,748
[SPEAKER_14]: At E3, not at our hotel.

215
00:26:10,028 --> 00:26:10,989
[SPEAKER_12]: At E3, yeah, right.

216
00:26:11,189 --> 00:26:13,189
[SPEAKER_12]: Our hotel, my ass.

217
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,851
[SPEAKER_12]: Although, our hotel is a step up from Jersey.

218
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:21,052
[SPEAKER_12]: So that's pretty much all that really happened.

219
00:26:21,072 --> 00:26:23,713
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, not too much exciting stuff, really.

220
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Lots of walking, feet tired.

221
00:26:26,454 --> 00:26:27,095
[SPEAKER_12]: We're on G4 TV.

222
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:41,795
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah, if you guys haven't heard the podcast yet, which by the way, we were doing podcasts every day from E3, and you can download this at www.orangeauntradio.com, click on Orange Aunt Radio to-go edition.

223
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:49,659
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually did live broadcast Wednesday, Thursday, Friday from E3, and I believe it's Thursday's edition we talked about this because it happened on Thursday.

224
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:51,840
[SPEAKER_14]: We're standing in line to get autographs.

225
00:26:52,141 --> 00:26:53,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, we're standing in line to get autographs.

226
00:26:54,002 --> 00:26:55,322
[SPEAKER_14]: For my dad, okay?

227
00:26:55,403 --> 00:26:56,063
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for my dad.

228
00:26:56,875 --> 00:27:08,185
[SPEAKER_14]: I, you know, I'm not starstruck or any of that stuff, you know, it's not a big deal to me, but my dad really loves the attack of the show, because he's loved the screensaver since the beginning, so I thought, okay, that would be a nice gift.

229
00:27:08,205 --> 00:27:16,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh my god, if only this were like last year or something, and Leo Laporte hadn't been fired yet, then I'd be starstruck, but... Maybe me too, a little bit, maybe me too, a little bit.

230
00:27:16,432 --> 00:27:17,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Because Leo's awesome, Leo, but...

231
00:27:18,726 --> 00:27:44,644
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyway, so, yeah, we were waiting in line, and they were filming G4TV.com ups on their little, like, platform there, because they were doing a lot of filming at E3, and so they were filming an episode of that, and they actually were, you know, filming the line as we were waiting to get in, just for bumpers for the commercials when you come in, you know, they do a little, you know, talking over the picture and whatnot, but, um,

232
00:27:45,723 --> 00:27:49,526
[SPEAKER_12]: But they basically filmed us for quite a long time on that.

233
00:27:50,327 --> 00:27:50,927
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, it's funny.

234
00:27:50,967 --> 00:27:54,410
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in the chatroom says, were you guys in one of the panning shots below the platform thing?

235
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:55,391
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, that was it.

236
00:27:55,891 --> 00:28:04,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, so we're down there, and we're in a couple of them, and I hear Brad and Irene are also in one for another show, too.

237
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:09,142
[SPEAKER_14]: They were in the live crowd shot or something at the very end, so I don't know.

238
00:28:09,923 --> 00:28:10,924
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's interesting.

239
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:11,944
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought it was pretty cool.

240
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:21,012
[SPEAKER_12]: And I slipped them, Kevin and Sarah, one of our media samplers while I was there as well.

241
00:28:21,972 --> 00:28:31,394
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to figure out if, like, he actually listened to it, which we kind of doubt, because, you know, people probably slip him all sorts of weird shit, and he doesn't, you know, he doesn't care.

242
00:28:31,854 --> 00:28:38,015
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're wondering if one of the interns is listening to it, or if one of the bums who found it in the trash out back ended up listening to it.

243
00:28:38,155 --> 00:28:38,515
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know.

244
00:28:41,196 --> 00:28:41,516
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

245
00:28:42,079 --> 00:28:45,122
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, but yeah, that was pretty much our E3, I believe.

246
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:48,405
[SPEAKER_12]: That pretty much sums it up, other than actual E3 stuff.

247
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,306
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

248
00:28:50,406 --> 00:28:50,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

249
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:53,529
[SPEAKER_14]: What kind of stuff did I do over the week?

250
00:28:53,870 --> 00:29:05,460
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty much the same thing, because we were pretty much hanging out together all the week, except I haven't had a car the past couple days, which kind of sucks, so I haven't been able to really go anywhere, because my car's getting repaired from the break-in when they stole my stereo a couple weeks ago.

251
00:29:07,467 --> 00:29:08,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Funny E3 stories.

252
00:29:08,768 --> 00:29:18,072
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't really have a whole lot to add to that except for me almost passing out because I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a damn hamburger in one of those lines downstairs where there's food.

253
00:29:19,032 --> 00:29:25,655
[SPEAKER_14]: Man, E3 is just so freaking crowded and they don't have enough stuff to handle everybody, it seems like.

254
00:29:25,995 --> 00:29:28,716
[SPEAKER_14]: I wonder if they actually put a limit on how many people can go to that.

255
00:29:28,756 --> 00:29:29,556
[SPEAKER_14]: They obviously don't.

256
00:29:29,897 --> 00:29:31,197
[SPEAKER_14]: It really seems like anybody can go.

257
00:29:31,957 --> 00:29:32,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much.

258
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:35,619
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, if Sinbad's in there, I mean, come on, Sinbad.

259
00:29:36,287 --> 00:29:58,913
[SPEAKER_12]: he's not in the industry nor is Gary Coleman although I could see maybe that he you know would get one of those legacy passes I don't know if he'd been there he'd get invites anyways Gary Coleman I think was in a game like a couple years ago it's possible I don't know but I don't know I think it's just kind of cool to see that they actually have interest in that kind of stuff though that's kind of neat

260
00:30:00,017 --> 00:30:01,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Where was Elijah Wood?

261
00:30:01,198 --> 00:30:05,242
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought he was this huge gamer because he was on MTV promoting the Xbox 360.

262
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:07,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Where was he at E3?

263
00:30:07,824 --> 00:30:08,724
[SPEAKER_12]: That's what I want to know.

264
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:10,766
[SPEAKER_07]: I have no idea.

265
00:30:11,547 --> 00:30:18,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess he had better things to do, more important than gaming stuff because he was such a hardcore gamer.

266
00:30:21,374 --> 00:30:21,654
[SPEAKER_14]: You know...

267
00:30:22,899 --> 00:30:35,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Apparently, I don't know if this is just a rumor or what have you, but one of my friends posted in LiveJournal about this, that the Xbox 360, because you got me thinking about that, that you couldn't really see the consoles at the Microsoft booth.

268
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,330
[SPEAKER_14]: You couldn't see the consoles at all.

269
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:39,672
[SPEAKER_14]: You just saw them running and you saw the controllers.

270
00:30:39,692 --> 00:30:40,873
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't see the actual console.

271
00:30:40,893 --> 00:30:42,294
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, the consoles were there.

272
00:30:42,434 --> 00:30:50,260
[SPEAKER_14]: But no, he said he looked into one, like he looked into one of the cases, and he saw a freaking Power Mac G5 in there, not an Xbox 360.

273
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,380
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

274
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:56,351
[SPEAKER_14]: So isn't that ironic if there's some secret Apple and Microsoft teaming up thing?

275
00:30:56,891 --> 00:30:59,732
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, first off, yes, the G5 processors are in there.

276
00:30:59,832 --> 00:31:02,153
[SPEAKER_12]: Second of all, the test kits look like a G5.

277
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:06,875
[SPEAKER_12]: And third of all, there were the actual Xbox 360s there.

278
00:31:06,915 --> 00:31:08,415
[SPEAKER_12]: They were just, it was built.

279
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:09,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Some of them were there.

280
00:31:09,355 --> 00:31:16,618
[SPEAKER_12]: Pretty much it was like a, looked like this white kind of pedestal thing, and then there was a little cutout, and the 360 was in that cutout.

281
00:31:17,318 --> 00:31:18,939
[SPEAKER_12]: But that was it.

282
00:31:19,688 --> 00:31:27,173
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, they were actually there, and it was probably running off of development kits, which they've had the pictures online for, and they look like G5s.

283
00:31:28,054 --> 00:31:35,139
[SPEAKER_12]: They pretty much are G5s, but it's because it runs off the same chipset, PowerPC stuff, so... Crazy.

284
00:31:35,920 --> 00:31:36,120
Yeah.

285
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,201
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you actually get to play anything for Xbox 360?

286
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:40,943
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, no.

287
00:31:41,083 --> 00:31:42,364
[SPEAKER_14]: I watched people play stuff.

288
00:31:42,444 --> 00:31:43,085
[SPEAKER_14]: I played one game.

289
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:45,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I played that Top Spin 2, the tennis game.

290
00:31:45,987 --> 00:31:46,928
[SPEAKER_12]: I watched people play...

291
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:48,671
[SPEAKER_12]: What was it?

292
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:50,773
[SPEAKER_12]: Need for Speed, Most Wanted.

293
00:31:51,553 --> 00:31:52,374
[SPEAKER_12]: That looked pretty cool.

294
00:31:54,036 --> 00:31:55,297
[SPEAKER_12]: I also, what was it?

295
00:31:55,317 --> 00:31:57,199
[SPEAKER_12]: I was watching demos for different things.

296
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,841
[SPEAKER_12]: But it was just like, it was cool.

297
00:31:59,901 --> 00:32:01,282
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's really good graphics.

298
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:09,210
[SPEAKER_12]: I did go online though and watch the rest of those, pretty much everything that you would have to wait in line for, for the PS3.

299
00:32:09,630 --> 00:32:10,671
[SPEAKER_12]: And that looks pretty cool.

300
00:32:10,691 --> 00:32:13,714
[SPEAKER_12]: Like they showed the new Gran Turismo game mock-up.

301
00:32:14,156 --> 00:32:23,502
[SPEAKER_12]: The re-rendered Final Fantasy 7 intro, the Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus stuff, and just the amount of details on there is pretty amazing.

302
00:32:24,483 --> 00:32:25,143
[SPEAKER_14]: That'll be interesting.

303
00:32:26,644 --> 00:32:27,405
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, so...

304
00:32:28,075 --> 00:32:29,776
[SPEAKER_14]: Now that's it for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day?

305
00:32:29,796 --> 00:32:31,778
[SPEAKER_14]: Because I have nothing really to add to what Loki had.

306
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:34,560
[SPEAKER_14]: So, let's talk about the music games.

307
00:32:35,401 --> 00:32:38,703
[SPEAKER_14]: This is honestly the biggest year for music games of E3.

308
00:32:38,884 --> 00:32:39,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.

309
00:32:39,384 --> 00:32:48,431
[SPEAKER_14]: So, starting off, the big surprise that just blew everybody out of the water and people were like, OMG, it's finally happening, Beatmania USA.

310
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:53,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Now Loki, I know you're not a really big Beatmania fan, but even you must have been impressed by this news.

311
00:32:53,955 --> 00:32:54,456
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think?

312
00:32:55,571 --> 00:32:58,574
[SPEAKER_12]: I just thought, ooh, yay, it's Beatmania.

313
00:32:59,314 --> 00:33:00,435
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm gonna go play DDR now.

314
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:08,421
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it was just like, I was hoping there'd be some different songs in there other than just, like, really old Konami originals.

315
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:15,206
[SPEAKER_12]: But, you know, this is test location stuff, but it did look pretty good for test location, like, you know, the E3 demo version or whatever.

316
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:17,127
[SPEAKER_12]: It looked pretty polished and stuff.

317
00:33:18,439 --> 00:33:26,808
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I don't know why people judge that as the final product, because it wasn't... I mean, if anyone remembers Ultra Mix 2 last year and how much it sucked, oh my god.

318
00:33:27,188 --> 00:33:31,413
[SPEAKER_14]: But yeah, this... Yeah, and then Ultra Mix 2 ends up being one of the best games they ever put out, arguably.

319
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:36,418
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it's just, it's mid, you know, it's not even finished yet, it's just partial.

320
00:33:36,986 --> 00:33:38,848
[SPEAKER_12]: So it was pretty good for what it was.

321
00:33:40,731 --> 00:33:43,735
[SPEAKER_12]: At least the controllers will be hopefully cheaper to bring in.

322
00:33:44,175 --> 00:33:46,598
[SPEAKER_14]: That's something where everybody wins.

323
00:33:46,698 --> 00:33:53,267
[SPEAKER_14]: Even if you're not a fan of Beatmania in the US and you're against the idea and you're like, I don't get the point because I have every Japanese mix anyway.

324
00:33:53,766 --> 00:33:55,087
[SPEAKER_14]: And I heard that they're going to be redesigned too.

325
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:27,485
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think it's some type of new pressing of the Japanese controllers because they still said on the turntable itself, I actually have a picture of them that I'm going to be putting in the Orange Lounge Radio galleries in the next couple days.

326
00:34:27,885 --> 00:34:30,786
[SPEAKER_14]: It actually says Beatmania 2DX on the little turntable.

327
00:34:31,227 --> 00:34:36,469
[SPEAKER_14]: So that makes me, because of the fact that they're not calling it 2DX here because there hasn't been a Beatmania 1 technically.

328
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:40,770
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, granted, we had Hip Hop Mania years ago, but I think they're just overlooking that.

329
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:44,252
[SPEAKER_12]: Because, you know, obviously the new modes, it doesn't really need to be 2DX.

330
00:34:45,339 --> 00:34:46,300
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

331
00:35:09,818 --> 00:35:12,381
[SPEAKER_14]: It was interesting, though, because they were actually plugging Beatmania.

332
00:35:12,421 --> 00:35:16,826
[SPEAKER_14]: If you watch the little trailer, because Konami, at their booth, they show trailers for all the games that are coming out.

333
00:35:17,227 --> 00:35:23,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, you'd have the DDR trailer and the Beatmania and the Castlevania and the We are the Winx, We are the Winx, that trailer as well.

334
00:35:23,694 --> 00:35:24,495
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are all playing.

335
00:35:24,736 --> 00:35:30,002
[SPEAKER_14]: What's interesting about the Beatmania trailer is that it actually said, Bringing the Arcade Experience Home.

336
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:33,183
[SPEAKER_14]: There were USA cabinets, though, but not for 2DX.

337
00:35:33,243 --> 00:35:34,283
[SPEAKER_14]: There was, remember, Hip Hop Mania.

338
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:45,687
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, there was Hip Hop Mania, which I thought was kind of weird, because, okay, A, the game is not being called Hip Hop Mania, and let me be the first to say, thank God they aren't calling it Hip Hop Mania, because I, for one, would have been really disappointed if they did.

339
00:35:45,707 --> 00:35:49,088
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, they can't call it Hip Hop Mania just because it would confuse people.

340
00:35:49,108 --> 00:35:52,449
[SPEAKER_14]: How about the fact that there was no hip hop songs in the demo, really?

341
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:58,731
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe one, and that's a stretch, but most of it's trance, and they can't really call it Hip Hop Mania.

342
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:00,139
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

343
00:36:14,621 --> 00:36:20,624
[SPEAKER_12]: That there was a song that's going to be in Happy Sky that's going to be in the US one also.

344
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:23,866
[SPEAKER_12]: And it's a DJ Amuro track.

345
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:32,911
[SPEAKER_12]: But I listened to the mp3 of it, or what it was supposedly, and it's not even a good fan-made one.

346
00:36:33,231 --> 00:36:37,733
[SPEAKER_12]: It has piano in it, so I guess that makes it a DJ Amuro track or whatever.

347
00:36:38,313 --> 00:36:38,634
[SPEAKER_11]: I guess.

348
00:36:38,674 --> 00:36:38,894
[SPEAKER_12]: Lame.

349
00:36:39,054 --> 00:36:39,414
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um...

350
00:36:40,467 --> 00:36:45,048
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they'll do stuff like that because obviously they haven't listed any licensed stuff.

351
00:36:45,088 --> 00:36:47,189
[SPEAKER_12]: And you never know, there might be licensed stuff in there.

352
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,190
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibly.

353
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:54,932
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a little weird for them to get licensed songs in there because of the fact that an artist is going to have to give up key samples and all this stuff.

354
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:56,092
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

355
00:36:56,232 --> 00:36:57,332
[SPEAKER_14]: But it worked in Amplitude.

356
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,993
[SPEAKER_14]: So there's no reason it can't happen because Amplitude has good stuff.

357
00:37:00,073 --> 00:37:02,454
[SPEAKER_12]: It worked in Amplitude and I'll see if the figure.

358
00:37:02,474 --> 00:37:05,475
[SPEAKER_12]: The other thing is they've got a good relationship with a different drummer.

359
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:06,401
[SPEAKER_12]: Beep Maniac

360
00:37:20,397 --> 00:37:23,378
[SPEAKER_12]: Happy Sky, and you know, it was in already, Ultramix 2.

361
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:25,839
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be a pretty easy sell, I would think.

362
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:27,060
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, we'll see.

363
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:42,086
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, you guys, actually on our website, www.orangelonsradio.com, I actually posted up an E3 preview of Beatmania USA, and there's actually screenshots from the actual game and everything, so you can check that out, and as part of it, it actually has the song list.

364
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:47,428
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys want to check out the songs that are going to show up, these were the songs that were in the demo, but you know,

365
00:37:47,768 --> 00:37:51,929
[SPEAKER_14]: Granted, if they're in the demo, they're probably going to end up in the full game, 99% certainty.

366
00:37:52,330 --> 00:38:02,413
[SPEAKER_14]: The seven key songs you're going to see in Beatmania USA, Dancing Into The Night, Nothing Ain't Stoppin', I Was The One, Shining Polaris, and In My Eyes.

367
00:38:02,993 --> 00:38:08,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, a lot of people were complaining at E3 because the difficulty level was very easy.

368
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:15,597
[SPEAKER_14]: In My Eyes was showing up as a flashing seven, but the note patterns were something you would see in a beginner note chart.

369
00:38:16,434 --> 00:38:19,477
[SPEAKER_14]: I guarantee you guys this is not the way the final release is going to be.

370
00:38:19,537 --> 00:38:20,298
[SPEAKER_14]: I guarantee it.

371
00:38:20,418 --> 00:38:21,519
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be like this.

372
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:24,743
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to see the same level of difficulty you see in the Japanese mixes.

373
00:38:24,763 --> 00:38:27,906
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why... Now this part I'm speculating.

374
00:38:27,946 --> 00:38:31,430
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why it was done this way, I speculate, is because...

375
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:39,311
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got people that have never seen this game before at E3.

376
00:38:39,571 --> 00:38:42,973
[SPEAKER_14]: 99% of the people in attendance at E3 probably never saw this game before.

377
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,453
[SPEAKER_14]: Probably only 1% of the people in attendance did.

378
00:38:46,454 --> 00:38:49,535
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was something to make the game very easily accessible to them.

379
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:51,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

380
00:39:06,814 --> 00:39:34,371
[SPEAKER_14]: anything that was in the demo now granted it's in light 7 mode but still all the songs on E3 appeared to be in beginner mode so even to have light 7 note charts in there I think shows you that there's more to come this is a very very early build just to kind of show off the game I wouldn't take anything in this too much as gospel you know what I mean so stop getting worked up over the fact that you know it was an easy mode

381
00:39:36,148 --> 00:39:48,678
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, let's see, also, if you put the game, now this is, this is where we get something really interesting and really different from the Japanese releases, and I think, honestly, this is a throw to the fans.

382
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:56,524
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't, I don't think this is something they had to do, I think this is something that they did for the fans, is they actually put, in 5 key mode, typically...

383
00:39:56,884 --> 00:40:07,170
[SPEAKER_14]: In Japan, for those of you guys that haven't played these games before, in 5 key mode, it's the 7 key songs, but they just put the 6th and 7th key on autoplay, so you only have 5 keys.

384
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,792
[SPEAKER_14]: And the reason why there is a 5 key mode is because the original Beatmania only had a 5 key mode.

385
00:40:11,812 --> 00:40:13,413
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a 5 key design.

386
00:40:14,534 --> 00:40:23,679
[SPEAKER_14]: So what they've done for the US release is they're actually putting, when you go into 5 key mode, instead of having 6 and 7 just be autoplay and it's the same list of songs, no, no.

387
00:40:24,412 --> 00:40:31,477
[SPEAKER_14]: You're actually going to get a completely different list of 5-key songs from the 5-key games.

388
00:40:32,117 --> 00:40:37,440
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's kind of a way for us to catch up on what we missed on Japanese 5-key releases.

389
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,883
[SPEAKER_14]: So really, in reality, you're getting two games in one.

390
00:40:41,403 --> 00:40:41,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Kinda.

391
00:40:42,404 --> 00:40:42,864
[SPEAKER_14]: You see what I mean?

392
00:40:47,307 --> 00:40:57,103
[SPEAKER_14]: Labasanova de Febieng, Overblast, Hunting for You, Metal Gear Solid Main Theme, and Paranoia Max Dirty Mix

393
00:41:00,356 --> 00:41:05,158
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm sure they'll have it where you can download, or not download, but they'll have more note charts.

394
00:41:05,198 --> 00:41:08,119
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sure they'll open up in 7-key and stuff.

395
00:41:08,139 --> 00:41:11,020
[SPEAKER_12]: So eventually probably everything will be played all over.

396
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:15,902
[SPEAKER_12]: It may have different note charts for 7 and 5 or something like that.

397
00:41:17,083 --> 00:41:18,043
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be interesting.

398
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:19,064
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so...

399
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,421
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm very excited about this.

400
00:41:21,481 --> 00:41:23,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, again, this is a very early build that we saw at E3.

401
00:41:24,302 --> 00:41:26,823
[SPEAKER_14]: The actual release of this game is not coming until 2006.

402
00:41:28,684 --> 00:41:30,344
[SPEAKER_14]: So we do have a little ways to wait.

403
00:41:30,744 --> 00:41:32,605
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot can happen between now and then as well.

404
00:41:33,385 --> 00:41:39,208
[SPEAKER_14]: From what I'm hearing, though, it's going to be early 2006, like first quarter, but you never know what might happen with these games.

405
00:41:39,228 --> 00:41:40,929
[SPEAKER_14]: It could be first or second.

406
00:41:40,949 --> 00:41:45,110
[SPEAKER_14]: But I would say you're definitely going to see this game first half of next year coming out.

407
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:46,551
[SPEAKER_14]: So it should be exciting.

408
00:41:46,891 --> 00:41:48,992
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, one thing that it's kind of getting slammed for...

409
00:41:49,975 --> 00:41:57,025
[SPEAKER_14]: is that the early press release on it, and the one sheet that was sent to the press about the game, states that there's going to be 50 songs in the mix.

410
00:41:57,425 --> 00:42:05,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And people are saying, well, if there's different song lists for 5 key and 7 key, that means there's going to be 25 songs in 5 key and 7 key.

411
00:42:05,316 --> 00:42:06,137
[SPEAKER_14]: That's kind of eh.

412
00:42:07,463 --> 00:42:11,866
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have to admit, if it's only going to be 25 songs in 7 key mode, that's a little bit eh.

413
00:42:11,906 --> 00:42:16,088
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm hoping that maybe... Now, nobody said it's going to be split right down the middle.

414
00:42:16,208 --> 00:42:21,512
[SPEAKER_14]: I think one thing that could be interesting is perhaps there's only 10 songs in 5 key mode, 40 in 7 key mode.

415
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:23,133
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's something that's kind of feasible.

416
00:42:24,133 --> 00:42:24,874
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what happens.

417
00:42:24,914 --> 00:42:26,194
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that might be a little more satisfying.

418
00:42:26,214 --> 00:42:29,056
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, I mean, it doesn't mean that they're going to be stuck in those modes.

419
00:42:29,096 --> 00:42:34,720
[SPEAKER_12]: Like I said, it's not going to take that much effort to make another note chart for...

420
00:42:35,740 --> 00:42:37,702
[SPEAKER_12]: One song that was a 5 key to 7 key.

421
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:38,963
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, it's not that hard.

422
00:42:39,063 --> 00:42:41,305
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just, you know, a little editing.

423
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:43,827
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I don't see why that would be a problem.

424
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:50,213
[SPEAKER_14]: So, anyway, it'll be interesting to see what kind of songs we get in this game as well.

425
00:42:50,293 --> 00:42:55,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, the interface is Night Styles interface, but we're seeing songs that date, you know, all the way back to early, early mixes.

426
00:42:56,699 --> 00:42:58,120
[SPEAKER_14]: Shining Polaris is what, uh,

427
00:42:58,775 --> 00:42:59,315
[SPEAKER_14]: 5th Style?

428
00:42:59,415 --> 00:43:00,876
[SPEAKER_14]: It was on 4th Style Consumer.

429
00:43:00,916 --> 00:43:02,116
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a 4th Style Consumer track.

430
00:43:02,417 --> 00:43:03,677
[SPEAKER_14]: So that goes a little ways back.

431
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:05,978
[SPEAKER_14]: Dirty Mix.

432
00:43:06,098 --> 00:43:08,619
[SPEAKER_14]: In My Eyes was a little bit, what, 5th Style?

433
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:10,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm having a hard time remembering some of this stuff.

434
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:11,360
[SPEAKER_12]: 4th, I think.

435
00:43:15,082 --> 00:43:19,043
[SPEAKER_14]: We should expect to see songs from a wide variety of the different Konami styles.

436
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:28,347
[SPEAKER_14]: What would be very cool, though, and I hope they do, and I don't know if they're going to end up doing this or not, but I'm hoping in 5-key mode we get at least one or two songs

437
00:43:28,905 --> 00:43:33,866
[SPEAKER_14]: from seventh mix or the final because those mixes were never released in Japan.

438
00:43:33,906 --> 00:43:38,047
[SPEAKER_14]: So if we got some of those songs, that would be very cool.

439
00:43:38,247 --> 00:43:41,228
[SPEAKER_14]: That would be a really nice thing for Konami to do for the U.S.

440
00:43:41,308 --> 00:43:46,989
[SPEAKER_14]: audience, I think, would be to give us at least one or two songs from seventh mix or the final to show that they care.

441
00:43:47,889 --> 00:43:48,369
[SPEAKER_14]: But we'll see.

442
00:43:48,689 --> 00:43:49,250
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see what happens.

443
00:43:50,550 --> 00:43:50,850
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

444
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:51,881
[SPEAKER_14]: Beatmania USA

445
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:11,221
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about some of the stuff that was actually going on at Konami's booth.

446
00:44:12,341 --> 00:44:15,822
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't just a bunch of games being... Let me take that back.

447
00:44:16,182 --> 00:44:17,663
[SPEAKER_14]: You had the games being shown, right?

448
00:44:17,703 --> 00:44:21,324
[SPEAKER_14]: You had Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 and Beatmania.

449
00:44:21,704 --> 00:44:26,365
[SPEAKER_14]: What some of you folks may not realize is that these games... I'm sorry, Karaoke Revolution Party as well.

450
00:44:26,846 --> 00:44:30,727
[SPEAKER_14]: These games were the center stage at Konami's booth.

451
00:44:31,087 --> 00:44:34,388
[SPEAKER_14]: They were the featured games by Konami this year.

452
00:44:35,345 --> 00:44:35,565
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

453
00:44:36,085 --> 00:44:45,629
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only that, they had this huge setup with this light-up wall, and they called it Club Revolution, and these were the centerpiece games that Konami was featuring this year.

454
00:44:46,149 --> 00:45:03,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Not only were they featuring the games live on center stage, they actually hired, this is something a lot of people haven't talked about on the forum, so I want to make this very clear, they actually hired this dance troupe, this really famous dance troupe called the Groovaloos, to come in and do about 10 shows throughout the three days of E3, maybe a little more, 10 to 12 shows.

455
00:45:08,571 --> 00:45:21,940
[SPEAKER_12]: And they're also the same people that are motion captured for the dancers for Ultra Mix 3.

456
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:24,082
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they're actually going to be motion captured dancers.

457
00:45:24,382 --> 00:45:28,825
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a little unclear which game because some people were saying Ultra Mix 3 and some people were saying Extreme 2.

458
00:45:29,085 --> 00:45:32,187
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it's Ultra Mix 2, I want to say.

459
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:33,028
[SPEAKER_14]: You mean Ultra Mix 3?

460
00:45:34,096 --> 00:45:42,604
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I think they actually started with probably Ultramix 2, because if you remember, they changed the whole... They re-motion captured everything for Ultramix 2, remember?

461
00:45:42,624 --> 00:45:43,005
[SPEAKER_12]: That's true.

462
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:48,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, regardless, one of the new games, maybe both, while we know, has the Groovaloos being motion captured on it.

463
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,154
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you like that dancing in the iPod commercial, that's what E.M.M.I.

464
00:45:52,334 --> 00:45:55,277
[SPEAKER_14]: and the new characters, Blues and stuff, that's what they're going to look like.

465
00:45:55,657 --> 00:45:56,638
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, it's going to be awesome.

466
00:45:57,239 --> 00:45:57,399
[SPEAKER_14]: So...

467
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,042
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

468
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:21,796
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

469
00:46:44,350 --> 00:46:45,991
[SPEAKER_14]: is that they highlighted all the games.

470
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:50,333
[SPEAKER_14]: So they actually got one of the girls from the Groovaloos would sing like Karaoke Revolution Party.

471
00:46:50,653 --> 00:46:53,755
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the songs featured in Karaoke Revolution Party is Crazy in Love.

472
00:46:54,135 --> 00:46:56,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So she actually got up there and started singing from Crazy in Love.

473
00:46:56,577 --> 00:46:59,678
[SPEAKER_12]: And the other guy also sang, you know, play that funky music, White Boy.

474
00:46:59,758 --> 00:47:00,419
[SPEAKER_14]: But this is the thing.

475
00:47:00,839 --> 00:47:06,682
[SPEAKER_14]: Karaoke Revolution Party is going to have this new mode we'll talk about a little later called Sing and Dance Mode where you can sing and dance at the same time.

476
00:47:07,222 --> 00:47:12,385
[SPEAKER_14]: When she was doing the sing and dance, if you watched her, the dance she was doing lined up with the arrows.

477
00:47:13,064 --> 00:47:23,414
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in a way, even though she wasn't playing the actual game, they actually showed the video, the Karaoke Revolution Party video, I mean, they had it all synced up, and the dance she was doing was the exact same dance that was on the screen.

478
00:47:23,434 --> 00:47:24,255
[SPEAKER_14]: It was awesome.

479
00:47:24,856 --> 00:47:33,804
[SPEAKER_14]: So, my point, the reason why I'm telling you all this, those of you folks that said that Konami does not support their US audience can now officially shut the fuck up.

480
00:47:34,965 --> 00:47:37,448
[SPEAKER_14]: Seriously, you got served.

481
00:47:38,130 --> 00:47:38,730
[SPEAKER_14]: at E3.

482
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,891
[SPEAKER_14]: The Groovaloos served you.

483
00:47:41,252 --> 00:47:41,712
[SPEAKER_14]: They did.

484
00:47:42,072 --> 00:47:42,953
[SPEAKER_14]: You just got served.

485
00:47:43,553 --> 00:47:53,878
[SPEAKER_14]: Konami has thrown all of their support by highlighting Karaoke Revolution Party, DDR, two of them, and now Beatmania.

486
00:47:54,618 --> 00:47:55,639
[SPEAKER_14]: All coming out in the US.

487
00:47:56,519 --> 00:48:04,983
[SPEAKER_14]: If you still, after all of this, think that Konami does not support their US audience when it comes to these music games, nothing is going to satisfy you.

488
00:48:05,504 --> 00:48:05,884
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing.

489
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So honestly, quit.

490
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:09,560
[SPEAKER_14]: Just quit.

491
00:48:10,421 --> 00:48:12,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Nothing they do is going to satisfy you.

492
00:48:12,521 --> 00:48:13,101
[SPEAKER_14]: Go away.

493
00:48:13,921 --> 00:48:15,061
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't need to hear from you anymore.

494
00:48:15,281 --> 00:48:15,562
[SPEAKER_14]: Quit.

495
00:48:15,842 --> 00:48:16,602
[SPEAKER_14]: Do us all a favor.

496
00:48:17,262 --> 00:48:27,844
[SPEAKER_14]: Because it is obvious and apparent that Konami obviously invested a lot of money into this stuff and that they are throwing their full support behind these new games.

497
00:48:28,664 --> 00:48:30,484
[SPEAKER_14]: So shut up.

498
00:48:32,164 --> 00:48:35,125
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted one of the songs that they were playing there and I don't know what it is.

499
00:48:36,016 --> 00:48:39,438
[SPEAKER_12]: Someone told me, though, that it was the music from one of the menus, which is pretty cool.

500
00:48:39,458 --> 00:48:44,842
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, actually, the very first song the Groovaloos did was supposedly some type of stage-like music or something.

501
00:48:45,102 --> 00:48:47,344
[SPEAKER_12]: I wanted it because I can remix it with no limit.

502
00:48:47,684 --> 00:48:54,108
[SPEAKER_12]: It would work perfect, but I can't find it because it's only in their little dance thing, and it makes me sad.

503
00:48:54,448 --> 00:48:55,329
[SPEAKER_12]: But it's all right.

504
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:56,070
[SPEAKER_12]: Soon enough.

505
00:48:57,551 --> 00:49:02,014
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, what I was going to say... For the...

506
00:49:03,852 --> 00:49:11,077
[SPEAKER_12]: I know we haven't really touched on this yet, Extreme 2 and stuff, but this is kind of a little off the topic of Japanese DDR.

507
00:49:11,498 --> 00:49:15,040
[SPEAKER_12]: We had the little thing where they're saying, you know, oh, hey, it's a new mix.

508
00:49:15,100 --> 00:49:15,981
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, the teaser thing?

509
00:49:16,021 --> 00:49:16,521
[SPEAKER_12]: Teaser thing.

510
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:17,462
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Extreme 2.

511
00:49:17,982 --> 00:49:30,611
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I know everyone is going, well, yeah, of course, it's Extreme 2, but we know this for a fact because the exact same footage, which they have still on their website teasing it, the exact same footage was in the intro for DDR Extreme 2.

512
00:49:30,651 --> 00:49:30,691
[SPEAKER_12]: So...

513
00:49:32,751 --> 00:49:33,211
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a fact.

514
00:49:33,312 --> 00:49:34,793
[SPEAKER_12]: It's Extreme 2 that they're plugging there.

515
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:44,901
[SPEAKER_12]: There's obviously other information that we'll cover probably a little bit later in the show regarding Extreme 2, at least rumors and that sort of thing.

516
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:47,123
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, DDR.

517
00:49:47,143 --> 00:49:47,263
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

518
00:49:48,797 --> 00:49:50,218
[SPEAKER_14]: Actually, I think we're going to take a break at this point.

519
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,519
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to come back and do some DDR.

520
00:49:51,539 --> 00:49:58,025
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk about Extreme 2, and I think before we come back and talk about Extreme 2, I'm actually going to play one of the brand new songs from Extreme 2.

521
00:49:58,105 --> 00:49:59,346
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a premiere.

522
00:49:59,406 --> 00:50:01,307
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think anybody else has played this song yet.

523
00:50:01,648 --> 00:50:03,689
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is a brand new premiere for you guys.

524
00:50:05,331 --> 00:50:06,332
[SPEAKER_14]: I just have to find it here.

525
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:08,426
[SPEAKER_14]: And I have played it.

526
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:34,476
[SPEAKER_14]: We have some interesting things to say about Guitar Hero.

527
00:50:34,776 --> 00:50:35,516
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get into that.

528
00:50:36,197 --> 00:50:37,077
[SPEAKER_14]: And what else?

529
00:50:37,097 --> 00:50:37,917
[SPEAKER_14]: There's other music games there.

530
00:50:50,427 --> 00:50:52,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Nobody even noticed, I think.

531
00:50:52,528 --> 00:50:54,489
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to talk about that all when we come back.

532
00:50:56,309 --> 00:50:58,750
[SPEAKER_14]: For now, though, let's get into the song from EX2.

533
00:50:59,291 --> 00:51:00,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, this is the song.

534
00:51:00,811 --> 00:51:10,095
[SPEAKER_14]: This song is Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha, and the song is called, and I'm going to mispronounce this first word here, Polovician...

535
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Plovzian, Dances and Chorus

536
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:34,552
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's really all I know, is that it's some new game that Konami's putting out.

537
00:51:34,572 --> 00:51:35,773
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks spiffy from the video, though.

538
00:51:35,793 --> 00:51:36,954
[SPEAKER_14]: The video looked pretty hot.

539
00:51:36,974 --> 00:51:39,276
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks like a Castlevania-ish title-ish.

540
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:44,520
[SPEAKER_12]: It'll be nice to actually hear the music since the bass that they had around there was a little too loud and I couldn't hear it.

541
00:51:45,360 --> 00:51:46,181
[SPEAKER_14]: So here it is, you guys.

542
00:51:46,381 --> 00:51:50,224
[SPEAKER_14]: World premiere for you guys here on Orange Lounge Radio from DDR Extreme 2.

543
00:51:50,584 --> 00:51:59,451
[SPEAKER_14]: This is the full version of Polovstian, and I'm sorry, I'm totally butchering that word, Polovstian Dances and Chorus.

544
00:51:59,631 --> 00:52:00,472
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back after this.

545
00:52:03,172 --> 00:52:06,093
[SPEAKER_08]: S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

546
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:20,268
Thank you.

547
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:18,731
[SPEAKER_01]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

548
00:57:18,831 --> 00:57:24,018
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

549
00:57:24,389 --> 00:57:27,911
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, we are back, and that was one of the brand new songs from DDR Extreme 2.

550
00:57:27,951 --> 00:57:31,954
[SPEAKER_14]: The full version there, Palovstian Dances and Chorus.

551
00:57:32,434 --> 00:57:33,474
[SPEAKER_14]: So, should be interesting.

552
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:36,136
[SPEAKER_14]: Now remember, that's going to be trimmed to DDR length.

553
00:57:36,176 --> 00:57:43,000
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you guys kind of thought, eh, it's a little bit repetitive there, and kind of gets slow in some parts, don't forget they're going to trim it so that it's more DDR friendly.

554
00:57:43,080 --> 00:57:47,463
[SPEAKER_14]: So you can kind of, you know, the fast parts there with the vocal, that's probably what you're going to see in the final release.

555
00:57:47,843 --> 00:57:52,346
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I did play that song in the demo, but it was so darn loud at E3 that I...

556
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:58,847
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't tell you what parts of it specifically are in there, sorry.

557
00:58:00,248 --> 00:58:03,089
[SPEAKER_14]: But I do remember it was fun and it had a pretty sweet video.

558
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:11,113
[SPEAKER_14]: It's exciting that they're going to other games other than just Silent Hill for some of their music.

559
00:58:11,473 --> 00:58:13,434
[SPEAKER_14]: So Konami's tapping into some of their other games.

560
00:58:13,455 --> 00:58:14,015
[SPEAKER_14]: It's kind of cool.

561
00:58:14,575 --> 00:58:20,498
[SPEAKER_14]: And then we'll get into Ultramix 3, which actually has a song from Castlevania in it, which was originally in Keyboard Mania.

562
00:58:20,838 --> 00:58:21,719
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get to that in a little bit.

563
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:24,400
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's talk about some of the DDRs.

564
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:28,442
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll start off with Extreme 2, since we played the song there in that break.

565
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:34,746
[SPEAKER_14]: We will open up the Skype line in a little bit here for you guys to call in if you have questions for us about E3, some other things.

566
00:58:35,086 --> 00:58:36,807
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's talk about Extreme 2 first off.

567
00:58:37,387 --> 00:58:38,187
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think of Extreme 2?

568
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:39,228
[SPEAKER_14]: You got a chance to play it, right?

569
00:58:39,248 --> 00:58:40,148
[SPEAKER_14]: It was cool.

570
00:58:40,448 --> 00:58:40,869
[SPEAKER_14]: I liked it.

571
00:58:41,569 --> 00:58:42,469
[SPEAKER_12]: I'll probably be buying it.

572
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:47,352
[SPEAKER_14]: What are some of the differences between Extreme 2 and Extreme 1?

573
00:58:48,593 --> 00:58:51,154
[SPEAKER_14]: First off, the interface went back to the old style.

574
00:58:51,894 --> 00:59:05,424
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, now it doesn't, not meaning that it copies Extreme One's interface, but that Konami basically got the hint that you guys didn't like the interface in Extreme USA, so they've changed it back to that style.

575
00:59:05,544 --> 00:59:06,565
[SPEAKER_14]: The standard song wheel.

576
00:59:06,585 --> 00:59:09,507
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, the song wheel that you guys are familiar with since DDR Max.

577
00:59:09,688 --> 00:59:09,848
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.

578
00:59:09,888 --> 00:59:12,650
[SPEAKER_14]: So, rest easy, it's gonna stick with that, so.

579
00:59:13,602 --> 00:59:15,824
[SPEAKER_12]: A lot more modes in this time.

580
00:59:17,004 --> 00:59:22,388
[SPEAKER_12]: I actually got to play the Extreme 2 in two different locations.

581
00:59:22,468 --> 00:59:28,732
[SPEAKER_12]: The first one being at Konami's booth, which had, you know, free play mode was the only thing available on it at the moment.

582
00:59:29,572 --> 00:59:32,674
[SPEAKER_12]: I was able to actually play a few songs on there.

583
00:59:32,714 --> 00:59:36,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Tried playing on, what was it, doubles and stuff.

584
00:59:36,776 --> 00:59:40,719
[SPEAKER_12]: But once again, Konami only had softpads, so...

585
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:42,389
[SPEAKER_12]: That was no good.

586
00:59:42,729 --> 00:59:49,132
[SPEAKER_12]: And then I got to play again on the Sony Entertainment booth.

587
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:51,333
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to play at the EyeToy support.

588
00:59:51,393 --> 00:59:53,514
[SPEAKER_12]: And by the way, there is a new EyeToy coming out.

589
00:59:54,075 --> 00:59:55,335
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks a lot smaller.

590
00:59:55,856 --> 00:59:56,756
[SPEAKER_12]: It looked pretty cool.

591
00:59:57,417 --> 01:00:03,520
[SPEAKER_12]: And I got to try the new hands and feet mode, which now is available in all difficulties.

592
01:00:05,421 --> 01:00:06,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten any better.

593
01:00:08,436 --> 01:00:10,540
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

594
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:28,210
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought Hands and Feet didn't, or if you played it on Heavy, it did not have the hands.

595
01:00:29,070 --> 01:00:30,871
[SPEAKER_14]: I could swear there was a way you could get them in there.

596
01:00:30,971 --> 01:00:32,452
[SPEAKER_14]: It's been so long since I played.

597
01:00:32,672 --> 01:00:34,933
[SPEAKER_14]: But regardless, it's a lot easier to figure out in Extreme 2.

598
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:36,894
[SPEAKER_14]: It's more logical, the way they have it set up.

599
01:00:37,594 --> 01:00:39,675
[SPEAKER_12]: They need to put it in edit mode, that's all I'm saying.

600
01:00:39,715 --> 01:00:42,877
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the only thing they need to do, and that option will be awesome.

601
01:00:42,937 --> 01:00:47,579
[SPEAKER_12]: Because if you can do your own hand motions and set up, you know, that would be an

602
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,149
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

603
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,440
[SPEAKER_14]: The iToy thing.

604
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,501
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I don't think anybody mentioned the iToy thing at Konami's booth.

605
01:01:15,842 --> 01:01:19,363
[SPEAKER_14]: This was something more at Sony's end they were kind of whoring out was the iToy thing.

606
01:01:19,383 --> 01:01:20,783
[SPEAKER_14]: They had it set up in their iToy area.

607
01:01:21,323 --> 01:01:25,325
[SPEAKER_14]: The big push for Xtreme 2 at Konami's booth was the online support.

608
01:01:25,665 --> 01:01:28,245
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is definitely not a rumor anymore.

609
01:01:28,305 --> 01:01:33,647
[SPEAKER_14]: You will be online with Xtreme 2 because this is what they were selling is that you're going to be able to do the online mode.

610
01:01:33,927 --> 01:01:38,969
[SPEAKER_14]: And in the feature I'm going to do later this week, we actually have screenshots from the online mode that'll show you kind of what it looks like.

611
01:01:41,189 --> 01:01:45,691
[SPEAKER_14]: So, over at Sony's booth, I actually played In the Heat of the Night Heavy with hands and feet.

612
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:48,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Huge crowd of people watching.

613
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:49,033
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see that?

614
01:01:49,073 --> 01:01:50,014
[SPEAKER_14]: Just like tons of people.

615
01:01:50,554 --> 01:01:54,756
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why I was able to do In the Heat of the Night Heavy, because it has a very easy step pattern for a heavy song.

616
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:56,337
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very logical seven footer.

617
01:01:56,377 --> 01:01:59,979
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just, you know, you're just basically running back and forth on the pad.

618
01:02:00,239 --> 01:02:01,480
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very easy to do the hands.

619
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:03,041
[SPEAKER_14]: You just kind of throw up your hands once in a while.

620
01:02:03,821 --> 01:02:04,382
[SPEAKER_14]: People love it.

621
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:06,362
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crazy.

622
01:02:06,502 --> 01:02:07,943
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that fag go!

623
01:02:07,963 --> 01:02:08,743
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at it go!

624
01:02:08,763 --> 01:02:16,986
[SPEAKER_12]: I tried doing Undo-Twa on that, and once again, Sony Softpad came to the rescue and failed me, and here's why.

625
01:02:17,406 --> 01:02:29,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I was playing hands and feet mode, and it was pretty hard as it was to coordinate myself to do hands on Undo-Twa because it has a really strange step pattern to it, and then the damn pad stuck to my shoe.

626
01:02:30,254 --> 01:02:30,854
[SPEAKER_12]: Yay!

627
01:02:31,135 --> 01:02:32,496
[SPEAKER_12]: I love those softpads.

628
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:36,558
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, Konami needs to make some better hardpads.

629
01:02:37,098 --> 01:02:45,043
[SPEAKER_12]: If not, I don't care if they're as good as the red octane pads, but please, so they at least have something else that they can demo at E3 next year.

630
01:02:45,984 --> 01:02:47,425
[SPEAKER_12]: God, I hate those softpads.

631
01:02:47,745 --> 01:02:49,086
[SPEAKER_12]: I hate them, I hate them, I hate them.

632
01:02:49,126 --> 01:02:51,207
[SPEAKER_12]: You can't play anything, you fail everything.

633
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:51,768
[SPEAKER_12]: It sucks.

634
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:52,588
[SPEAKER_12]: They suck.

635
01:02:52,708 --> 01:02:55,630
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know how I got started on those pads, but they suck.

636
01:02:57,811 --> 01:02:58,392
[SPEAKER_12]: Give me something better.

637
01:02:59,685 --> 01:03:04,350
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's talk about some of the songs that are actually going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

638
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:09,395
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of people very excited that Erotic is finally making its way into a US mix.

639
01:03:10,717 --> 01:03:17,904
[SPEAKER_14]: And this is very interesting, just because a lot of people, especially previously, were like, you know, well, In The Groove's the only way we're ever going to see Erotic songs at home.

640
01:03:18,445 --> 01:03:20,167
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Konami kind of pulls this one out.

641
01:03:20,507 --> 01:03:22,329
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, nope, we're going to put In The Heat Of The Night on there.

642
01:03:23,024 --> 01:03:23,324
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Xtreme 2

643
01:03:45,473 --> 01:03:47,556
[SPEAKER_14]: E-Rotic, In the Heat of the Night, of course, as we mentioned.

644
01:03:47,696 --> 01:03:49,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Genie in a Bottle, but it's a cover of it.

645
01:03:49,558 --> 01:03:52,621
[SPEAKER_14]: It's by the NC featuring NRG Factory.

646
01:03:53,042 --> 01:03:58,087
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'm wondering if that isn't one of those Karaoke Revolution crossovers.

647
01:03:58,588 --> 01:03:58,768
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

648
01:03:59,529 --> 01:03:59,849
[SPEAKER_12]: Really?

649
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:01,091
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of a clubby...

650
01:04:01,545 --> 01:04:02,385
[SPEAKER_12]: Sean Paul with Get Busy

651
01:04:26,784 --> 01:04:27,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Love and Liberty by Naoki Underground

652
01:04:49,584 --> 01:04:51,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Un De Trois, of course, as mentioned.

653
01:04:51,786 --> 01:04:53,027
[SPEAKER_14]: And then some other songs as well.

654
01:04:53,107 --> 01:04:58,151
[SPEAKER_14]: Can Be Real, Vision F, La Bamba from DDR Extreme, of course, showed up there.

655
01:04:58,471 --> 01:05:02,494
[SPEAKER_14]: A new song by Sotov called Saturday Night Love was in there as well.

656
01:05:02,514 --> 01:05:03,614
[SPEAKER_12]: I played that a little bit.

657
01:05:03,755 --> 01:05:05,116
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't quite hear it, though.

658
01:05:05,176 --> 01:05:06,036
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, it's hard to hear.

659
01:05:06,316 --> 01:05:06,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Too loud.

660
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:12,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Tons of characters are going to show up in Extreme 2 as well.

661
01:05:12,521 --> 01:05:15,403
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you see the new character select screen on some of the screenshots that are online?

662
01:05:15,423 --> 01:05:15,503
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

663
01:05:15,762 --> 01:05:16,182
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty big.

664
01:05:16,242 --> 01:05:17,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Crazy amounts of characters in there.

665
01:05:18,304 --> 01:05:28,853
[SPEAKER_14]: Rumor is, and I didn't see this, and I haven't seen this in the press release either, but I was reading in some of the forums, rumor is that it's supposed to have some type of store mode where you earn points and buy things with the points.

666
01:05:29,874 --> 01:05:30,695
[SPEAKER_12]: I guess.

667
01:05:30,935 --> 01:05:38,682
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, that sounds sort of like the mode that they had in Extreme for the Japanese one, I think.

668
01:05:38,702 --> 01:05:40,263
[SPEAKER_12]: No, it wasn't Extreme, it was...

669
01:05:42,558 --> 01:05:44,021
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching!

670
01:05:58,024 --> 01:06:03,826
[SPEAKER_14]: One of the screenshots that actually we got in the press kit actually reveals some other songs that weren't in the demo.

671
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:09,708
[SPEAKER_14]: And the other songs that weren't actually in the demo were Be Lovin' by D.Crew is going to show up in the game as well.

672
01:06:09,748 --> 01:06:12,069
[SPEAKER_14]: So you remember Be Lovin' from DDR Extreme.

673
01:06:12,109 --> 01:06:18,051
[SPEAKER_14]: And then Yuzo Koshiro featuring Julie Rougarde with a song called You Gotta Move It.

674
01:06:18,972 --> 01:06:21,633
[SPEAKER_14]: So those songs are going to show up in DDR Extreme as well.

675
01:06:21,813 --> 01:06:22,673
[SPEAKER_14]: So it should be interesting.

676
01:06:25,321 --> 01:06:33,824
[SPEAKER_14]: DDR Extreme 2 also having a Mission Mode thing in it, or I guess it's like Dance Master Mode, where you're kind of like climbing around this tree.

677
01:06:34,164 --> 01:06:38,425
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, these are things that were not available in the demo that they had at E3.

678
01:06:38,445 --> 01:06:41,546
[SPEAKER_14]: These are just things we're getting off the screenshots that were available in the press kit.

679
01:06:42,166 --> 01:06:46,327
[SPEAKER_14]: A very souped-up version of Mission Mode called Dance Master Mode.

680
01:06:48,008 --> 01:06:51,309
[SPEAKER_14]: And then just some, of course, new backgrounds and new screens.

681
01:06:53,415 --> 01:06:55,216
[SPEAKER_14]: New grading system.

682
01:06:55,436 --> 01:06:56,436
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of clicks around.

683
01:06:56,477 --> 01:06:59,798
[SPEAKER_14]: It makes a little like beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, when it's scrolling through the different grades.

684
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:01,879
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of sounds like the Price is Right wheel or something.

685
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:02,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

686
01:07:03,019 --> 01:07:06,000
[SPEAKER_14]: And then there's an online play.

687
01:07:06,561 --> 01:07:08,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We can see the options on the screenshot.

688
01:07:08,762 --> 01:07:14,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Head-to-head, ranking challenge, practice, data options, and logout.

689
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:21,367
[SPEAKER_14]: What's really interesting, though, about the screenshot, and I don't get this, but at the very top it says, 32 weeks from beginning...

690
01:07:22,054 --> 01:07:22,555
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

691
01:07:35,202 --> 01:07:35,722
[SPEAKER_12]: See you right there.

692
01:07:35,783 --> 01:07:36,383
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the shot.

693
01:07:37,144 --> 01:07:41,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, no, we can't... Yeah, I'm actually scanning through some of the screens... Whoa!

694
01:07:41,767 --> 01:07:42,168
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that?

695
01:07:42,208 --> 01:07:42,708
[SPEAKER_14]: That was weird.

696
01:07:42,728 --> 01:07:43,008
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

697
01:07:43,889 --> 01:07:52,576
[SPEAKER_14]: We're actually scanning through some of the screenshots in the press kit right now, and you actually can see screens that are in that teaser that was on the Japanese site.

698
01:07:52,616 --> 01:07:53,457
[SPEAKER_14]: So this is...

699
01:07:54,187 --> 01:08:00,132
[SPEAKER_14]: This game, for those of you that are interested in what's coming next in Japan, it's going to be a port of Extreme 2, as if you couldn't figure that out already.

700
01:08:00,673 --> 01:08:04,856
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, and I just wanted to point something out here, too.

701
01:08:05,116 --> 01:08:08,319
[SPEAKER_12]: And I heard this, and I have to see it in my screenshots there.

702
01:08:08,779 --> 01:08:16,366
[SPEAKER_12]: But apparently, in one of the backgrounds here, we have a familiar little background.

703
01:08:16,386 --> 01:08:17,687
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to find it here.

704
01:08:18,527 --> 01:08:22,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank God they didn't have the pictures of those people dancing with the eye toy like they did last year.

705
01:08:22,848 --> 01:08:24,209
[SPEAKER_12]: You've gone through all the pictures now, didn't you?

706
01:08:24,229 --> 01:08:24,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay.

707
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:24,929
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, anyways.

708
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:33,772
[SPEAKER_12]: Apparently, and I didn't see this, but apparently someone saw a video that was on a website or whatever and had the familiar dancing bears.

709
01:08:34,872 --> 01:08:37,773
[SPEAKER_12]: You know those familiar dancing bears from Romeo and Juliet?

710
01:08:39,414 --> 01:08:39,814
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, yeah?

711
01:08:40,334 --> 01:08:41,954
[SPEAKER_12]: And someone thought that that song might be in there.

712
01:08:41,974 --> 01:08:43,275
[SPEAKER_12]: I hope not, because that song's not in there.

713
01:08:43,295 --> 01:08:45,495
[SPEAKER_12]: But I think, weren't they in the video to be loving?

714
01:08:46,256 --> 01:08:46,976
[SPEAKER_12]: I think they were.

715
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:50,523
[SPEAKER_12]: So I think people are smoking crack, but, you know, whatever.

716
01:08:50,703 --> 01:08:51,403
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see, we'll see.

717
01:08:52,404 --> 01:08:55,747
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so that's going to do it for us talking about Xtreme 2.

718
01:08:56,067 --> 01:08:58,389
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's move on to talking about the other dance game.

719
01:08:59,110 --> 01:09:02,793
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, and I'd like to mention the Xtreme 2 logo does look very nice.

720
01:09:03,233 --> 01:09:05,315
[SPEAKER_12]: It does.

721
01:09:05,395 --> 01:09:06,756
[SPEAKER_12]: I was very disappointed it wasn't purple.

722
01:09:06,776 --> 01:09:08,117
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, you didn't get your purple interface.

723
01:09:08,157 --> 01:09:09,659
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a very bluish green.

724
01:09:09,799 --> 01:09:12,301
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, it looked nice, though.

725
01:09:12,765 --> 01:09:15,566
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's move on to talk about the other dancing game Konami was showing off.

726
01:09:15,926 --> 01:09:20,007
[SPEAKER_14]: They were not showing DDR with Mario at Konami's booth, by the way, but we will get into that.

727
01:09:20,027 --> 01:09:22,688
[SPEAKER_12]: They like to disavow all knowledge of DDR with Mario.

728
01:09:22,768 --> 01:09:28,209
[SPEAKER_14]: It's DDR Mario Mix is actually what they're calling it, and it didn't show up until you actually walked over to Nintendo's booth.

729
01:09:28,509 --> 01:09:29,990
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, I have kind of a funny story.

730
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:32,191
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll get into that a little bit, but let's talk Ultramix 3.

731
01:09:32,351 --> 01:09:34,711
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think of Ultramix 3, Loki?

732
01:09:35,371 --> 01:09:35,912
[SPEAKER_12]: That was cool.

733
01:09:36,212 --> 01:09:36,692
[SPEAKER_12]: I liked it.

734
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:37,332
[SPEAKER_12]: I played it.

735
01:09:37,748 --> 01:09:38,629
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

736
01:09:57,113 --> 01:09:57,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

737
01:10:21,291 --> 01:10:21,871
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

738
01:10:48,668 --> 01:10:50,389
[SPEAKER_12]: Some pretty cool new songs that were on there.

739
01:10:51,189 --> 01:10:53,510
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a new MidiHead remix that was in there.

740
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:55,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, and we're going to actually play that very soon.

741
01:10:55,290 --> 01:10:56,791
[SPEAKER_14]: MidiHead is going to do a new remix.

742
01:10:56,851 --> 01:10:59,611
[SPEAKER_14]: It's called Jelly Kiss, MidiHead Smack Mix.

743
01:11:00,792 --> 01:11:04,693
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, in Ultra Mix 3, we're going to have Akumajo Dracula Medley.

744
01:11:04,753 --> 01:11:08,614
[SPEAKER_14]: That is the Castlevania Songs compilation that is in Keyboard Mania.

745
01:11:08,894 --> 01:11:09,594
[SPEAKER_14]: It's crossing over.

746
01:11:10,115 --> 01:11:14,136
[SPEAKER_14]: I have been begging for this song for two years, and it's finally there.

747
01:11:14,256 --> 01:11:15,036
[SPEAKER_14]: I would like to thank...

748
01:11:15,940 --> 01:11:18,801
[SPEAKER_14]: I am directly responsible for this song being in there, but I'll just keep going.

749
01:11:18,821 --> 01:11:26,104
[SPEAKER_12]: And for all you people that were bitching and moaning before, yes, your damn stupid Max ripoff song, Sakura, is in there now.

750
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:32,827
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, Sakura is showing up in Ultimate Extreme, which has a lot of people bitching that it's not showing up in Extreme 2 yet, but a lot can change.

751
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,248
[SPEAKER_12]: God, people, are you never happy?

752
01:11:35,408 --> 01:11:37,709
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, that song is just a stupid Max remix.

753
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,170
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on, folks.

754
01:11:40,479 --> 01:11:45,381
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, just because it's in Ultramix 3 does not mean it's not going to show up in Extreme 2.

755
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:46,342
[SPEAKER_14]: We just don't know yet.

756
01:11:46,482 --> 01:11:47,442
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a limited song list.

757
01:11:47,943 --> 01:11:50,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Another song people have been bitching about for forever.

758
01:11:50,584 --> 01:11:53,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally coming to the USA after years and years.

759
01:11:53,765 --> 01:11:55,126
[SPEAKER_14]: Butterfly, SmileDK.

760
01:11:55,950 --> 01:11:57,271
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I had to laugh.

761
01:11:57,291 --> 01:11:58,451
[SPEAKER_12]: That was funny.

762
01:11:59,372 --> 01:12:01,993
[SPEAKER_12]: Didn't people say, oh, SmileDK hates Konami now?

763
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:04,734
[SPEAKER_12]: Who was that freestyling Kyle Snyder's routine?

764
01:12:04,814 --> 01:12:07,276
[SPEAKER_14]: Lil B. Lil B. Yeah, he was up there.

765
01:12:07,296 --> 01:12:08,316
[SPEAKER_12]: That was funny.

766
01:12:08,916 --> 01:12:10,557
[SPEAKER_14]: So Butterfly is going to be in Ultramix 3.

767
01:12:11,177 --> 01:12:13,278
[SPEAKER_14]: Finally, like how many home releases is this later?

768
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:14,759
[SPEAKER_14]: 11 home mixes later or something?

769
01:12:14,999 --> 01:12:15,740
[SPEAKER_14]: We get Butterfly.

770
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:17,701
[SPEAKER_14]: Breakdown would be for you.

771
01:12:18,001 --> 01:12:20,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Togo featuring Sana on Miracle Moon, LED light style.

772
01:12:21,082 --> 01:12:23,003
[SPEAKER_14]: Daikin Kai is going to show up.

773
01:12:23,103 --> 01:12:24,624
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys love to whore that song out.

774
01:12:25,066 --> 01:12:34,396
[SPEAKER_14]: Firefly, Destiny Lovers, The Legend of Max, Emotion, Kiss Me All Night Long, Eversnow, and Candy Star.

775
01:12:34,716 --> 01:12:36,077
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty impressive song list so far.

776
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:38,140
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of songs playable in the Ultramix 3 demo.

777
01:12:39,041 --> 01:12:40,822
[SPEAKER_12]: Other things different about Ultramix?

778
01:12:41,263 --> 01:12:43,045
[SPEAKER_12]: There was a brand new freestyle mode.

779
01:12:44,186 --> 01:12:45,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, kind of interesting.

780
01:12:45,447 --> 01:12:46,228
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to play that.

781
01:12:46,784 --> 01:12:48,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for watching, and I'll see you next time.

782
01:13:08,593 --> 01:13:08,913
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura.com

783
01:13:27,521 --> 01:13:29,442
[SPEAKER_12]: And they give you a grading at the end.

784
01:13:29,802 --> 01:13:31,482
[SPEAKER_12]: But you basically can do whatever you want.

785
01:13:31,622 --> 01:13:34,923
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's counting your calories as you burn, too.

786
01:13:34,983 --> 01:13:35,963
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's very interesting.

787
01:13:36,003 --> 01:13:38,424
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be a very neat kind of addition.

788
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:39,944
[SPEAKER_14]: It sounded kind of lame.

789
01:13:40,124 --> 01:13:44,445
[SPEAKER_12]: And they give you suggestions like, why don't you try some hold notes or something like that.

790
01:13:44,465 --> 01:13:45,506
[SPEAKER_12]: And it was very strange.

791
01:13:46,046 --> 01:13:47,526
[SPEAKER_12]: That was something new that was in there.

792
01:13:47,886 --> 01:13:52,688
[SPEAKER_12]: And then the brand new thing, which is really strange, Quest Mode.

793
01:13:52,788 --> 01:13:53,528
[SPEAKER_12]: Quest Mode is...

794
01:13:54,927 --> 01:13:56,648
[SPEAKER_14]: More interesting than I thought it would be.

795
01:13:57,089 --> 01:14:07,836
[SPEAKER_14]: Quest mode actually seems very similar to the mission mode that's showing up in Xtreme 2, except instead of just this giant tree, you have this states and capitals map.

796
01:14:08,117 --> 01:14:15,242
[SPEAKER_14]: So you have a map of the states of the union with all the various capitals, and you start quest mode in Orange Lounge's home of Sacramento.

797
01:14:15,342 --> 01:14:15,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you very much.

798
01:14:16,503 --> 01:14:17,924
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was done for us, by the way.

799
01:14:18,004 --> 01:14:18,564
[SPEAKER_14]: No, I'm kidding.

800
01:14:18,664 --> 01:14:23,568
[SPEAKER_12]: And what's also great about that is you have to pick up your dance crew, I guess, along the way.

801
01:14:23,588 --> 01:14:23,728
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

802
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:25,709
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

803
01:14:45,151 --> 01:14:45,771
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty cool.

804
01:14:46,152 --> 01:14:46,432
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

805
01:14:46,812 --> 01:14:53,395
[SPEAKER_14]: So if you live in a state capital, you'll be able to play in your home ground on the quest mode in Ultramix 3.

806
01:14:53,955 --> 01:14:54,255
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

807
01:14:54,975 --> 01:14:56,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get into this.

808
01:14:56,376 --> 01:15:02,799
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually have an E3 bootleg exclusive, and you know this is Loki's fault.

809
01:15:03,059 --> 01:15:04,039
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, what did you do here?

810
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:12,283
[SPEAKER_12]: I recorded the MIDI head remix with this really crappy mic and a really crappy digital recorder that I have.

811
01:15:13,036 --> 01:15:19,058
[SPEAKER_12]: and therefore you get this really crappy quality recording but it's the only one you're going to hear unless you were there.

812
01:15:20,259 --> 01:15:21,800
[SPEAKER_14]: And we got to preface this.

813
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:25,821
[SPEAKER_14]: The reason why we had to record this for you guys is the Jelly Kiss remix is very hot.

814
01:15:26,461 --> 01:15:27,502
[SPEAKER_14]: It is very hot.

815
01:15:27,522 --> 01:15:30,843
[SPEAKER_14]: Middyhead is incredible at his remixes.

816
01:15:30,923 --> 01:15:32,684
[SPEAKER_14]: He's so good at remixing the songs.

817
01:15:33,044 --> 01:15:35,685
[SPEAKER_12]: I played this song about 25 times while I was there.

818
01:15:37,003 --> 01:15:43,745
[SPEAKER_12]: So, honestly, I wish I had a better mix for you, because this doesn't do it justice, but it's still hot.

819
01:15:43,825 --> 01:15:50,147
[SPEAKER_14]: This will just have to kind of, at least you can get an idea, but trust me guys, this is a very crappy quality.

820
01:15:50,187 --> 01:15:52,508
[SPEAKER_14]: This is like crappy location test quality, okay?

821
01:15:52,908 --> 01:15:57,610
[SPEAKER_12]: This is like Beatmania 2DX test location.

822
01:15:58,317 --> 01:15:59,678
[SPEAKER_12]: with a microphone, okay?

823
01:16:00,058 --> 01:16:05,602
[SPEAKER_12]: At least I actually had a microphone and didn't just use the microphone on the tape recorder, because that would have sucked even worse.

824
01:16:05,702 --> 01:16:08,444
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see how bad this is, because I haven't heard how bad the quality this is.

825
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:09,244
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, it's pretty bad.

826
01:16:09,564 --> 01:16:10,425
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, well, let's see.

827
01:16:11,045 --> 01:16:12,566
[SPEAKER_14]: I might have to cut this off if it's too bad.

828
01:16:12,686 --> 01:16:13,267
[SPEAKER_12]: No, come on.

829
01:16:13,487 --> 01:16:15,028
[SPEAKER_12]: You've got to play a minute.

830
01:16:15,048 --> 01:16:15,508
[SPEAKER_12]: Fine.

831
01:16:15,728 --> 01:16:17,009
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a minute and 47 seconds.

832
01:16:17,069 --> 01:16:21,993
[SPEAKER_14]: If you don't like the quality, you just turn down your speakers, but trust me, you guys, this song is so hot.

833
01:16:22,393 --> 01:16:27,076
[SPEAKER_14]: Jelly Kiss, Smitty Head Smack Mix, bootleg version, Orange Lounge Radio exclusive.

834
01:16:27,995 --> 01:16:28,155
[SPEAKER_08]: Ready?

835
01:16:28,255 --> 01:16:28,736
[SPEAKER_08]: Get down!

836
01:16:28,856 --> 01:16:29,136
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, Julie!

837
01:17:02,094 --> 01:17:02,534
and many more.

838
01:17:53,163 --> 01:17:57,006
[SPEAKER_08]: Honestly guys, that recording doesn't do the song justice.

839
01:18:16,730 --> 01:18:19,991
[SPEAKER_14]: But you could hear that the remix is really good.

840
01:18:20,031 --> 01:18:22,132
[SPEAKER_14]: You could at least get an idea of what it sounds like.

841
01:18:22,152 --> 01:18:23,052
[SPEAKER_12]: Exactly.

842
01:18:23,152 --> 01:18:29,294
[SPEAKER_12]: It's not great, but I tried the best I could to clean that up, and it just was not doing me any good.

843
01:18:29,454 --> 01:18:32,875
[SPEAKER_14]: Please don't base your opinion of that song off that recording.

844
01:18:33,095 --> 01:18:36,836
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really for the hardcore fans to whet your appetite a little bit for the real thing.

845
01:18:36,856 --> 01:18:39,977
[SPEAKER_12]: At least it gives you an idea of what it's going to sound like, and it sounded really cool.

846
01:18:39,997 --> 01:18:41,658
[SPEAKER_12]: When I heard it, I was like, oh, I've got to play this.

847
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,578
[SPEAKER_12]: So it'll be cool.

848
01:18:44,439 --> 01:18:45,039
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't doubt it.

849
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:45,559
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

850
01:18:47,025 --> 01:18:47,466
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

851
01:18:56,403 --> 01:18:58,184
[SPEAKER_12]: Wasn't much, but the mic was like $10.

852
01:18:58,324 --> 01:18:59,544
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, come on.

853
01:18:59,604 --> 01:19:00,445
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah, the mic.

854
01:19:00,565 --> 01:19:04,627
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, gosh, it was that same microphone we use for our podcasts away from home.

855
01:19:04,927 --> 01:19:05,367
[SPEAKER_12]: $10 mic.

856
01:19:05,647 --> 01:19:17,052
[SPEAKER_12]: See, like if I had professional recording equipment, actually what I would have preferred to do, but obviously I had no access to do this, would be to pull one of the audio connectors out of the speaker and actually hook it up directly to it.

857
01:19:18,473 --> 01:19:25,756
[SPEAKER_12]: Ideally, you know, if I had known somebody that worked there that would let me do that, that would be awesome because I had the tools to do that.

858
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:29,260
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, right, like they're actually going to let me bootleg this song.

859
01:19:30,341 --> 01:19:32,461
[SPEAKER_14]: What you did was crazy enough.

860
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:36,062
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't believe, because there was a Konami person that walked right by you as you were doing that.

861
01:19:36,542 --> 01:19:38,442
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't believe that they were cool with it.

862
01:19:38,462 --> 01:19:40,102
[SPEAKER_12]: I not only did that once, I did that twice.

863
01:19:40,122 --> 01:19:44,383
[SPEAKER_12]: Because the first time, somehow my erase button got stuck down.

864
01:19:44,463 --> 01:19:46,604
[SPEAKER_12]: So it got erased the first time.

865
01:19:46,744 --> 01:19:49,044
[SPEAKER_12]: And I did that, the first time was on the stage.

866
01:19:49,564 --> 01:19:50,764
[SPEAKER_12]: I did that right there.

867
01:19:50,924 --> 01:19:53,765
[SPEAKER_12]: So no one really cared, but you know.

868
01:19:54,652 --> 01:19:59,156
[SPEAKER_12]: I really wish I had a plug that could have gotten a game copy of it.

869
01:20:00,137 --> 01:20:04,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks in the chatroom are begging us to put that bootleg copy up somewhere.

870
01:20:04,020 --> 01:20:05,381
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to think about it.

871
01:20:07,382 --> 01:20:12,346
[SPEAKER_14]: I really don't want people to think that this is what the song is actually going to sound like because it will be much better.

872
01:20:12,847 --> 01:20:15,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully, MidiHead, he likes to put these things up on his site.

873
01:20:16,029 --> 01:20:18,371
[SPEAKER_14]: Hopefully he'll do something for the fans over there.

874
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:20,373
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll beg and plead.

875
01:20:20,993 --> 01:20:22,735
[SPEAKER_14]: Everybody go to MidiHead's site and beg and plead.

876
01:20:23,504 --> 01:20:24,284
[SPEAKER_14]: But he might not be able to.

877
01:20:24,505 --> 01:20:26,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't beg too much, because if he says he can't, then he can't.

878
01:20:26,846 --> 01:20:31,648
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, Konami might be wanting to put this on a VRare later or something, so... Oh, it will be on a VRare.

879
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:34,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, he might not be able to do it, so don't bug him too much.

880
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:36,191
[SPEAKER_14]: If he says no, leave him alone.

881
01:20:36,931 --> 01:20:39,753
[SPEAKER_14]: But if there's even a possibility he might do it, bug him.

882
01:20:42,334 --> 01:20:42,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

883
01:20:44,406 --> 01:20:45,327
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's go to a break.

884
01:20:45,447 --> 01:20:48,048
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's do a break because we need to stretch a little bit here.

885
01:20:49,369 --> 01:20:53,211
[SPEAKER_14]: Just a rundown of the different modes that are going to be in Ultramix 3 as well before we get a break.

886
01:20:53,271 --> 01:21:07,420
[SPEAKER_14]: Party mode, freestyle, quest mode, workout mode, challenge mode, playing online, Xbox Live, training mode, edit mode, jukebox mode, which is something we didn't mention but it wasn't playable in the demo, that's why, but we imagine it's just the videos and nothing else.

887
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,061
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of like jukebox mode in 2DX.

888
01:21:09,541 --> 01:21:11,462
[SPEAKER_14]: And options, of course.

889
01:21:12,043 --> 01:21:13,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I love playing the options mode.

890
01:21:13,724 --> 01:21:13,984
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

891
01:21:14,605 --> 01:21:22,853
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, what we're going to do is we're going to talk a little bit about DDR with Mario, or DDR Mario Mix, as they're going to call it in the U.S.

892
01:21:23,234 --> 01:21:24,355
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to talk about In the Groove.

893
01:21:24,595 --> 01:21:29,520
[SPEAKER_14]: I still want to talk In the Groove, and we want to get Loki's thoughts on In the Groove as well.

894
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:37,508
[SPEAKER_12]: And Loki also tries a bunch of different hardpads in succession, making him very tired.

895
01:21:39,741 --> 01:21:41,863
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, yeah, yeah, that's, oh, yeah, we got to talk about that.

896
01:21:41,883 --> 01:21:46,727
[SPEAKER_14]: Some of the other Kenshiya Hall tour that we did, a little Kenshiya Hall tour that we did.

897
01:21:47,007 --> 01:21:58,196
[SPEAKER_12]: And I want to also touch on how I almost got in trouble a few times at the Infinity Gaming booth with their Feel 3.

898
01:21:58,416 --> 01:21:59,177
[SPEAKER_12]: No, we'll talk about that.

899
01:22:00,006 --> 01:22:12,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So, in this break, I thought what we could do is actually do some music from Ultramix 3, because we actually have a lot of the songs already in rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, our music program that runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and we're not here.

900
01:22:12,621 --> 01:22:16,265
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to play some of the songs that are going to be featured in Ultramix 3, in case you guys haven't heard them yet.

901
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:21,522
[SPEAKER_12]: And should we also mention that one of our cast members is no longer with us?

902
01:22:22,362 --> 01:22:24,043
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we should mention this.

903
01:22:24,163 --> 01:22:28,064
[SPEAKER_14]: One of our cast members is no longer with the show.

904
01:22:28,184 --> 01:22:30,845
[SPEAKER_12]: They have been snatched up by the Katamari.

905
01:22:30,945 --> 01:22:35,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, they have been stuck on the giant Katamari and gone forever.

906
01:22:35,187 --> 01:22:36,387
[SPEAKER_14]: And that is one of our ferrets.

907
01:22:36,727 --> 01:22:43,370
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's actually the ferret in question is the ferret that was broken and Loki actually operated on him.

908
01:22:43,931 --> 01:22:48,575
[SPEAKER_12]: It was one of the ones I operated on, and it's also one of Jamie's favorites.

909
01:22:48,615 --> 01:22:51,397
[SPEAKER_12]: The one that's all, you know, it's all, woo-ha!

910
01:22:51,417 --> 01:22:53,419
[SPEAKER_12]: Which made me even happier to get rid of it.

911
01:22:53,879 --> 01:22:54,800
[SPEAKER_14]: Sorry, Jamie, if you're listening.

912
01:22:54,820 --> 01:23:01,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we have old ferrets still here, but the new ferrets... We still do have one of the ferrets here, and this is Jamie's absolute favorite ferret.

913
01:23:02,606 --> 01:23:03,927
[SPEAKER_14]: So, he's still here.

914
01:23:04,467 --> 01:23:07,370
[SPEAKER_12]: Hmm, actually, that might be one of the old ones, or the new ones.

915
01:23:07,590 --> 01:23:09,111
[SPEAKER_12]: Isn't this the old school ferret?

916
01:23:09,171 --> 01:23:10,632
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was the very first ferret.

917
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:11,453
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember.

918
01:23:13,044 --> 01:23:13,864
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, that might be the only one.

919
01:23:13,884 --> 01:23:14,324
[SPEAKER_12]: I think it is.

920
01:23:14,484 --> 01:23:14,785
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

921
01:23:14,885 --> 01:23:15,185
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

922
01:23:15,805 --> 01:23:17,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the ferrets is gone.

923
01:23:18,166 --> 01:23:18,966
[SPEAKER_14]: I like our chat room.

924
01:23:19,426 --> 01:23:21,487
[SPEAKER_14]: www.orangeentrader.com Click on chat.

925
01:23:21,507 --> 01:23:22,587
[SPEAKER_14]: They're always hilarious in there.

926
01:23:23,267 --> 01:23:26,468
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody in there saying, Dark Tetsuya, port of 40.

927
01:23:29,529 --> 01:23:30,069
[SPEAKER_14]: In memory.

928
01:23:31,230 --> 01:23:31,530
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

929
01:23:32,170 --> 01:23:38,372
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back after this with DDR Mario Mix, In the Groove, Little Guitar Hero, our trip to Kenshiya Hall, and more.

930
01:23:38,632 --> 01:23:39,072
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll be back.

931
01:23:44,031 --> 01:23:45,152
[SPEAKER_10]: Music, Music, Music

932
01:24:10,366 --> 01:24:11,087
Thank you for watching!

933
01:24:38,727 --> 01:24:44,697
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, Kaizenbo, Karlaienbo, Kaizenbosu, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo, Kaizenbo

934
01:25:06,346 --> 01:25:07,987
DarkSakura, Loki, VOG Network

935
01:28:22,336 --> 01:28:23,938
Thanks for watching!

936
01:29:38,283 --> 01:29:44,108
[SPEAKER_18]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

937
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:58,844
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back here at Orange Lounge Radio and we're going to be talking about now DDR Mario Mix.

938
01:29:58,884 --> 01:30:01,245
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, did you get a chance to play some DDR Mario Mix?

939
01:30:01,786 --> 01:30:04,787
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I looked at it and it looked like crap.

940
01:30:05,528 --> 01:30:11,811
[SPEAKER_12]: So, no, honestly, I didn't get to play it just because, I don't know, it just wasn't my thing.

941
01:30:11,971 --> 01:30:13,172
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, it looked a little easy.

942
01:30:13,232 --> 01:30:16,874
[SPEAKER_12]: It looked kind of very Disney Rave-ish and I just didn't want to touch it.

943
01:30:18,595 --> 01:30:19,436
[SPEAKER_12]: But it looked interesting.

944
01:30:20,016 --> 01:30:20,296
[SPEAKER_12]: Different.

945
01:30:21,861 --> 01:30:23,782
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, this is the thing about DDR Mario Mix.

946
01:30:23,802 --> 01:30:25,462
[SPEAKER_14]: They actually weren't showing this at Konami's booth.

947
01:30:25,502 --> 01:30:27,943
[SPEAKER_14]: You actually had to go over to Nintendo's booth to see this.

948
01:30:28,103 --> 01:30:34,825
[SPEAKER_14]: And what's really interesting is I asked somebody at Konami's booth, who I know kind of well, what's up with DDR with Mario?

949
01:30:34,885 --> 01:30:36,805
[SPEAKER_14]: And they were like, oh, it's a Japanese-only release.

950
01:30:36,985 --> 01:30:38,466
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, okay.

951
01:30:38,946 --> 01:30:40,606
[SPEAKER_14]: Then I walk over to Nintendo's booth, and there it is.

952
01:30:40,626 --> 01:30:41,227
[SPEAKER_14]: They're showing it.

953
01:30:41,267 --> 01:30:42,147
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm like, you lied to me.

954
01:30:42,507 --> 01:30:44,027
[SPEAKER_14]: Too many people lied to me this E3.

955
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:45,208
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a dirty liar.

956
01:30:45,568 --> 01:30:47,028
[SPEAKER_14]: Too many dirty liars at E3.

957
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:49,729
[SPEAKER_14]: But, um...

958
01:30:51,015 --> 01:30:51,575
[SPEAKER_14]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

959
01:31:20,439 --> 01:31:25,642
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say it was about the equivalent of a 5-footer, and I AAA'd it my first try.

960
01:31:27,763 --> 01:31:32,106
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's about the skill level you're going to see on DDR Mario Mix.

961
01:31:32,746 --> 01:31:34,847
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm not one of those people that can AAA every song.

962
01:31:35,368 --> 01:31:38,570
[SPEAKER_14]: I've AAA'd some songs, but nothing that crazy.

963
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:44,513
[SPEAKER_14]: So DDR Mario Mix is definitely not for the hardcore DDR player.

964
01:31:45,029 --> 01:31:52,873
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless you happen to be a fan of Mario as well, then you might like this mix because it's going to have a lot of songs, especially for you in this.

965
01:31:54,114 --> 01:32:04,699
[SPEAKER_14]: But as far as the DDR person that's looking for the next 10-footer and is hoping that it's going to be the star medley and Mario is going to be a 10-footer, I highly doubt it.

966
01:32:04,779 --> 01:32:06,740
[SPEAKER_14]: This is a mix that's going to be for kids mostly.

967
01:32:09,982 --> 01:32:12,063
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's look at some of the...

968
01:32:13,303 --> 01:32:15,644
[SPEAKER_14]: songs that are going to be in Dance Dance Revolution with Mario.

969
01:32:16,004 --> 01:32:18,745
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really, did you actually take a look at the song list at all?

970
01:32:20,025 --> 01:32:23,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, a little bit, not, very briefly.

971
01:32:23,406 --> 01:32:26,687
[SPEAKER_14]: But did you see any songs in there that weren't from a Mario game?

972
01:32:26,947 --> 01:32:27,087
[SPEAKER_12]: No.

973
01:32:27,267 --> 01:32:36,930
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I realize it's DDR Mario Mix, but with Nintendo putting this out, you would still think you'd get maybe, I don't know, a Donkey Kong song, or a Zelda song, or something.

974
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:37,150
[SPEAKER_14]: No.

975
01:32:37,631 --> 01:32:38,791
[SPEAKER_14]: All Mario songs.

976
01:32:40,197 --> 01:33:02,768
[SPEAKER_14]: Starring Wario, Boo Boogie, Rollercoasting, Hammerdance, Blooper Bop, In the World Pool, Fishing Frenzy, Jump Jump Jump, Destruction Dance, Garden Boogie, Underground Mozart, Here We Go, Up Down Left Right, Always Smilin', Rendezvous on Ice, Deep Freeze, Cabin Fever, and Frozen Pipes are the songs in Dance Dance Revolution Memorial.

977
01:33:03,108 --> 01:33:06,450
[SPEAKER_14]: Also should be noted about DDR Mario Mix, um,

978
01:33:07,085 --> 01:33:07,145
[SPEAKER_14]: D.D.R.

979
01:33:28,593 --> 01:33:40,257
[SPEAKER_12]: There was one, it's very similar to Mario, or the one where you would... Actually, it was exactly the same as the one for the DDR Extreme, where you would run using left and right and hit up for a jump.

980
01:33:41,457 --> 01:33:43,097
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, you know, with Mario, obviously.

981
01:33:44,758 --> 01:33:45,158
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

982
01:33:45,378 --> 01:33:58,222
[SPEAKER_12]: Honestly, what I think would be kind of cool is later on when the next game comes out, which will be kind of similar to Donkey Kong's Jungle Beat, where it uses the DDR pad, but it's not a music game

983
01:33:58,922 --> 01:33:59,925
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, maybe.

984
01:34:00,447 --> 01:34:04,299
[SPEAKER_12]: So, I'm hoping, hopefully something like that will come out justifying this purchase.

985
01:34:05,004 --> 01:34:13,366
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I don't want to knock this, because I think Nintendo has always been, they do a lot of kid-friendly things, so I think this is going to be a good thing.

986
01:34:13,746 --> 01:34:16,426
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to sit here and knock this mix, because I think it's going to be a good thing.

987
01:34:16,707 --> 01:34:18,627
[SPEAKER_14]: I think a lot of the Mario music is very good.

988
01:34:18,707 --> 01:34:19,947
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's going to be a fun thing.

989
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:30,009
[SPEAKER_14]: I think if you have a lot of parties, and you have friends over that don't play DDR very much, this is going to be a mix that can really enable them to get into DDR a little more.

990
01:34:30,149 --> 01:34:33,150
[SPEAKER_12]: Nintendo knows one thing, it's how to make a party game, and...

991
01:34:33,587 --> 01:34:37,851
[SPEAKER_12]: So I don't doubt that one bit that any sort of party mode on that would be perfect.

992
01:34:38,271 --> 01:34:42,214
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm not going to say, you know, DDR Mario Mix sucks because it doesn't.

993
01:34:42,314 --> 01:34:43,295
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just different.

994
01:34:43,415 --> 01:34:46,037
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not for you hardcore players.

995
01:34:46,257 --> 01:34:52,682
[SPEAKER_14]: It's for kids and, you know, people that, you know, are not familiar with DDR but maybe are Nintendo fans.

996
01:34:52,702 --> 01:34:56,025
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this could expose DDR to a whole new audience, which, you know, is a good thing.

997
01:34:56,205 --> 01:34:56,646
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely.

998
01:34:58,407 --> 01:34:59,428
[SPEAKER_14]: Questions from our chat room.

999
01:35:01,699 --> 01:35:05,962
[SPEAKER_14]: So, does Nintendo have a release time frame for DDR Mario Mix?

1000
01:35:08,904 --> 01:35:12,826
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know of anything because we didn't get a Nintendo press kit.

1001
01:35:13,246 --> 01:35:16,829
[SPEAKER_14]: But Jamie's in our chat right now and I'm wondering if she was able to schmooze her way to get a press kit.

1002
01:35:17,509 --> 01:35:18,870
[SPEAKER_14]: We think by end of year.

1003
01:35:19,530 --> 01:35:22,352
[SPEAKER_14]: Hasn't everything we've been reading saying like October, November time frame-ish?

1004
01:35:22,872 --> 01:35:26,514
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 are looking at the same time frame.

1005
01:35:26,535 --> 01:35:28,436
[SPEAKER_14]: Will be released end of year-ish.

1006
01:35:29,316 --> 01:35:30,557
[SPEAKER_14]: Definitely in time for the holiday season.

1007
01:35:32,205 --> 01:35:34,586
[SPEAKER_14]: I do remember Nintendogs is out August 22nd.

1008
01:35:34,606 --> 01:35:36,046
[SPEAKER_14]: That's one thing I did hear.

1009
01:35:36,146 --> 01:35:42,168
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendogs, by the way, on the podcast I named Nintendogs my favorite game of the whole damn show.

1010
01:35:42,288 --> 01:35:43,409
[SPEAKER_14]: Nintendogs is going to rock.

1011
01:35:43,929 --> 01:35:45,049
[SPEAKER_12]: I can't wait for that game.

1012
01:35:45,269 --> 01:35:46,650
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to be freaking awesome.

1013
01:35:48,270 --> 01:35:48,930
[SPEAKER_12]: So cute.

1014
01:35:50,451 --> 01:35:51,271
[SPEAKER_12]: I just love dogs.

1015
01:35:52,852 --> 01:35:54,812
[SPEAKER_12]: No, but really, I can't wait for that.

1016
01:35:55,772 --> 01:36:00,434
[SPEAKER_12]: Mario Kart Advance or not Advance, DS kind of disappointed me.

1017
01:36:01,624 --> 01:36:05,426
[SPEAKER_12]: But anyways, let's see here.

1018
01:36:06,906 --> 01:36:08,287
[SPEAKER_12]: I was just going to check real quick.

1019
01:36:08,307 --> 01:36:09,708
[SPEAKER_12]: Check some of the websites.

1020
01:36:09,848 --> 01:36:11,829
[SPEAKER_12]: See if we can answer that question.

1021
01:36:12,749 --> 01:36:14,670
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, if I can't figure out when it's coming out.

1022
01:36:15,670 --> 01:36:16,891
[SPEAKER_12]: Nope, to be announced 2005.

1023
01:36:17,551 --> 01:36:18,552
[SPEAKER_14]: It's going to be out this year.

1024
01:36:19,132 --> 01:36:22,333
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say bank on October, November, that time frame.

1025
01:36:22,473 --> 01:36:25,355
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's a good... It's got to be out for the holiday season, honestly.

1026
01:36:26,055 --> 01:36:30,417
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, if you're a Nintendo fan, another title not to miss that's coming out next month, Meteos.

1027
01:36:31,278 --> 01:36:32,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome puzzle game.

1028
01:36:32,420 --> 01:36:33,081
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome puzzle game.

1029
01:36:36,365 --> 01:36:37,707
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what other Bomani games are we talking about?

1030
01:36:37,727 --> 01:36:38,268
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's it.

1031
01:36:38,368 --> 01:36:41,733
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's all the official Bomani releases that are coming out.

1032
01:36:41,793 --> 01:36:43,415
[SPEAKER_14]: So that takes us to the one of Bomani.

1033
01:36:45,378 --> 01:36:46,640
[SPEAKER_14]: So down in Kenshiya Hall...

1034
01:36:47,290 --> 01:36:48,571
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, Kenshi Hall.

1035
01:36:48,971 --> 01:36:50,312
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think of Kenshi Hall this year?

1036
01:36:50,812 --> 01:36:52,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Kenshi Hall blew.

1037
01:36:52,233 --> 01:36:53,814
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a little weak compared to last year.

1038
01:36:53,834 --> 01:36:56,956
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of that was because Game Infinity got promoted to West Hall.

1039
01:36:57,296 --> 01:36:57,676
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah.

1040
01:36:57,696 --> 01:36:59,658
[SPEAKER_14]: So Game Infinity wasn't in Kenshi Hall this year.

1041
01:37:00,978 --> 01:37:03,000
[SPEAKER_14]: But there were some interesting things there.

1042
01:37:03,260 --> 01:37:03,340
[SPEAKER_14]: One...

1043
01:37:04,401 --> 01:37:05,021
[SPEAKER_14]: GetUpMove.com

1044
01:37:23,815 --> 01:37:27,158
[SPEAKER_14]: All they had set up were the metal pads and no TVs.

1045
01:37:27,638 --> 01:37:30,200
[SPEAKER_14]: And they had boxes for In The Groove, display boxes.

1046
01:37:30,480 --> 01:37:35,644
[SPEAKER_14]: They were kind of promoting In The Groove, but nothing to show.

1047
01:37:36,545 --> 01:37:38,446
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was kind of like, well, that's kind of weird.

1048
01:37:38,707 --> 01:37:39,647
[SPEAKER_14]: I was a little surprised.

1049
01:37:39,687 --> 01:37:42,470
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, wouldn't you want to show off your game that's coming out really soon?

1050
01:37:42,930 --> 01:37:43,490
[SPEAKER_14]: And I asked.

1051
01:37:43,630 --> 01:37:44,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I flat out asked the guy.

1052
01:37:44,711 --> 01:37:45,352
[SPEAKER_14]: I said, you know...

1053
01:37:46,263 --> 01:37:50,907
[SPEAKER_14]: I know there's things that have happened in the past few weeks that possibly have delayed the home release.

1054
01:37:51,467 --> 01:37:53,329
[SPEAKER_14]: What can you tell me about the release date of the home release?

1055
01:37:53,389 --> 01:38:01,836
[SPEAKER_14]: And he told me that he could say it was pushed back a little bit, but mid-June is the target release now.

1056
01:38:02,576 --> 01:38:05,318
[SPEAKER_14]: And he didn't say it was pushed back because of what was going on.

1057
01:38:05,358 --> 01:38:10,322
[SPEAKER_12]: In fact, the rep told me... Yeah, if I were to guess, I would say it's probably not because of that.

1058
01:38:10,442 --> 01:38:14,286
[SPEAKER_12]: It's probably because of the USB support that they were trying to fix.

1059
01:38:15,306 --> 01:38:16,027
[SPEAKER_12]: That would be my guess.

1060
01:38:16,682 --> 01:38:17,122
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1061
01:38:17,403 --> 01:38:20,924
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the people are saying it's because of Sony's delay or something.

1062
01:38:20,944 --> 01:38:21,224
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1063
01:38:21,505 --> 01:38:28,288
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't really know what the delay is, but we don't think it's related to the lawsuit anymore, which I guess I was proven wrong from last week.

1064
01:38:28,388 --> 01:38:32,150
[SPEAKER_14]: I was convinced that this was going to delay the home release, but hey, I was wrong.

1065
01:38:32,190 --> 01:38:32,971
[SPEAKER_14]: But you know what?

1066
01:38:33,051 --> 01:38:39,214
[SPEAKER_14]: I also said I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong on it because I think the home release should come out, so it looks like it's coming out.

1067
01:38:40,274 --> 01:38:42,295
[SPEAKER_14]: And from what the rep had told me...

1068
01:38:44,834 --> 01:38:52,882
[SPEAKER_14]: They are going ahead with it because they feel that the lawsuit is more to do with the refitting of DDR arcade cabinets.

1069
01:38:53,202 --> 01:39:00,670
[SPEAKER_14]: Red Octane was named nowhere in that suit, so they are proceeding with a home release because they feel that the lawsuit is strictly aimed at the arcade releases.

1070
01:39:01,150 --> 01:39:03,953
[SPEAKER_14]: So they're going to release this sucker in mid-June.

1071
01:39:04,273 --> 01:39:04,814
[SPEAKER_14]: My advice?

1072
01:39:05,535 --> 01:39:06,236
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1073
01:39:25,928 --> 01:39:27,450
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks for watching!

1074
01:39:42,504 --> 01:40:10,636
[SPEAKER_12]: it's the rubbery parts that were inset were inset too far and they were too rubbery and they actually there's no it's good for sticking to the pad but it's not good if you want to actually do any freestyling or stuff on it I did not like their new pads I thought they stunk I would not spend my money on them and I would not even touch nor play ever again in the groove or in the groove 2 or any sort of incarnation of in the groove it sucked ass and I do not support it at all

1075
01:40:13,066 --> 01:40:14,123
[SPEAKER_14]: Now tell us how you really feel.

1076
01:40:15,248 --> 01:40:16,649
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, okay, here's how I really feel.

1077
01:40:16,729 --> 01:40:21,791
[SPEAKER_12]: I think that the interface is playing such a stupid port of Step Mania to the PlayStation 2.

1078
01:40:22,071 --> 01:40:25,573
[SPEAKER_12]: So all you people that want to play Step Mania on the PlayStation 2, there you go, here it is.

1079
01:40:26,033 --> 01:40:26,593
[SPEAKER_12]: Enjoy.

1080
01:40:26,734 --> 01:40:30,295
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as you're wanting original music, you're not going to find it in the groove.

1081
01:40:30,575 --> 01:40:35,898
[SPEAKER_12]: In the groove is just a bunch of rehashed, really amateurish music that you're going to find there.

1082
01:40:36,258 --> 01:40:38,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, sure, there's some good licensed songs in there.

1083
01:40:38,639 --> 01:40:39,380
[SPEAKER_12]: Good, play those.

1084
01:40:39,420 --> 01:40:42,021
[SPEAKER_12]: That's about all you're going to enjoy as far as in the groove goes.

1085
01:40:42,301 --> 01:40:44,462
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, if you want something harder for you,

1086
01:40:44,742 --> 01:40:46,203
[SPEAKER_12]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1087
01:41:09,788 --> 01:41:10,188
[SPEAKER_13]: You know what?

1088
01:41:11,489 --> 01:41:12,310
[SPEAKER_12]: Let me just put it this way.

1089
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:13,951
[SPEAKER_12]: There's better music games coming out this year.

1090
01:41:14,011 --> 01:41:14,932
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't waste your money.

1091
01:41:15,212 --> 01:41:24,578
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't have the... When I first played in the groove, I wasn't like, OMG, this is the best thing ever, but I wasn't anti-in the groove like you were.

1092
01:41:25,839 --> 01:41:27,340
[SPEAKER_14]: But it grew on me.

1093
01:41:27,540 --> 01:41:31,663
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you should give it another chance, because in the groove, it grew on me as I played it more and more.

1094
01:41:32,748 --> 01:41:35,670
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm sorry though, but these people are going, Oh, it's not DDR!

1095
01:41:35,770 --> 01:41:36,671
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it is DDR.

1096
01:41:36,731 --> 01:41:37,591
[SPEAKER_12]: It's exactly DDR.

1097
01:41:37,611 --> 01:41:39,953
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I can't argue with you there.

1098
01:41:40,033 --> 01:41:42,735
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very, very much DDR.

1099
01:41:43,095 --> 01:41:46,758
[SPEAKER_14]: But the dance pads, I completely disagree.

1100
01:41:46,778 --> 01:41:48,199
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the Afterburners are great.

1101
01:41:48,479 --> 01:41:49,700
[SPEAKER_14]: I loved playing on them.

1102
01:41:50,481 --> 01:41:53,623
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where I don't get it, because I thought they were great.

1103
01:41:53,723 --> 01:41:55,604
[SPEAKER_12]: Okay, the Afterburners are an okay pad.

1104
01:41:55,624 --> 01:41:58,466
[SPEAKER_12]: They just have a fatal flaw in it, and that's that they're inset too far.

1105
01:41:58,967 --> 01:42:01,348
[SPEAKER_12]: Raise them up just a few millimeters, and you'll be perfect.

1106
01:42:01,428 --> 01:42:02,329
[SPEAKER_12]: They'll be a great pad.

1107
01:42:02,768 --> 01:42:09,754
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just right now, they're too far, so you're gonna... You're playing on them, it's awkward, because they're inset too far, and that's why.

1108
01:42:09,914 --> 01:42:10,594
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't like them.

1109
01:42:11,035 --> 01:42:12,716
[SPEAKER_12]: I played on a lot of different hardpads.

1110
01:42:12,796 --> 01:42:18,100
[SPEAKER_12]: There's... Trust me, there are pads worse than the afterburners there, and we played on those right afterwards.

1111
01:42:18,121 --> 01:42:24,145
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, now, now, you... Even though you're knocking on the afterburners, what happened after you left Red Octane's booth?

1112
01:42:24,165 --> 01:42:32,172
[SPEAKER_14]: You went to DDR Games' booth, and you played on that metal pad, which has a bar, by the way, so this would be great for you and the groove players, except...

1113
01:42:32,725 --> 01:42:35,106
[SPEAKER_12]: Except the thing is flat and you can't tell where you are.

1114
01:42:35,186 --> 01:42:36,427
[SPEAKER_12]: It's soft pad syndrome.

1115
01:42:36,447 --> 01:42:38,789
[SPEAKER_12]: You basically float all over the pad and you miss stuff.

1116
01:42:39,229 --> 01:42:41,430
[SPEAKER_12]: Not only that, but it wasn't very sensitive at all.

1117
01:42:41,650 --> 01:42:43,251
[SPEAKER_12]: That's the other thing I didn't like about the Afterburner.

1118
01:42:43,271 --> 01:42:44,412
[SPEAKER_12]: It didn't seem sensitive at all.

1119
01:42:44,732 --> 01:42:49,935
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I was testing it to see... Is it maybe just that the Afterburner was worn out from all the people playing on it?

1120
01:42:50,175 --> 01:42:54,478
[SPEAKER_13]: It's possible... When I played at the premiere, I thought the pads were...

1121
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,011
[SPEAKER_13]: and Ristine.

1122
01:42:56,231 --> 01:42:57,672
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought they were awesome guys.

1123
01:42:57,852 --> 01:43:01,094
[SPEAKER_12]: My complaints with it would be that one, the arrows are rubbery.

1124
01:43:01,134 --> 01:43:09,920
[SPEAKER_12]: They should be just like a metal type thing because honestly if you're playing with shoes you're still going to get grip but if you want to actually slide on them you can actually do that as well.

1125
01:43:10,841 --> 01:43:13,463
[SPEAKER_12]: That I think would be beneficial for them.

1126
01:43:13,603 --> 01:43:24,871
[SPEAKER_12]: The reason why that they're rubbery is that you stick too much and so it kills your ankles when you do that because it's just not quite like plexiglass and you get the same syndrome if you play on a pad that's sticky.

1127
01:43:25,524 --> 01:43:25,844
[SPEAKER_12]: Who is this?

1128
01:43:25,924 --> 01:43:27,326
[SPEAKER_12]: Hello, Dark Sakura, how are you?

1129
01:43:50,067 --> 01:43:51,167
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm exhausted.

1130
01:43:51,568 --> 01:43:52,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm tired.

1131
01:43:52,268 --> 01:43:53,808
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in the car all day.

1132
01:43:54,128 --> 01:43:55,249
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I know how that feels.

1133
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:57,549
[SPEAKER_14]: It kind of sucks driving in the car all day long.

1134
01:43:57,589 --> 01:43:58,389
[SPEAKER_14]: How was Disneyland?

1135
01:43:59,730 --> 01:44:01,150
[SPEAKER_00]: Disneyland was pretty fun.

1136
01:44:02,591 --> 01:44:04,951
[SPEAKER_00]: They turned off the fast pass at Roger Rabbit, though.

1137
01:44:04,971 --> 01:44:06,032
[SPEAKER_00]: That kind of made me upset.

1138
01:44:06,112 --> 01:44:08,192
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, I went on Indiana Jones twice.

1139
01:44:08,932 --> 01:44:09,373
[SPEAKER_14]: Very cool.

1140
01:44:09,393 --> 01:44:11,173
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the best ride you rode while you were there?

1141
01:44:11,873 --> 01:44:13,654
[SPEAKER_00]: Indiana Jones, without a doubt.

1142
01:44:13,974 --> 01:44:14,414
[SPEAKER_14]: Heck yeah.

1143
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:19,553
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been talking about E3 tonight, of course, obviously, that's what this show's been about.

1144
01:44:19,873 --> 01:44:21,274
[SPEAKER_14]: What were your impressions?

1145
01:44:21,294 --> 01:44:23,076
[SPEAKER_00]: No, we went to Timbuk2.

1146
01:44:23,816 --> 01:44:25,737
[SPEAKER_14]: What were your impressions of some of the stuff at E3?

1147
01:44:26,658 --> 01:44:30,681
[SPEAKER_14]: We've talked about Beatmania and the Konami DDRs, and we were moving into In the Groove.

1148
01:44:31,341 --> 01:44:32,702
[SPEAKER_14]: What were your thoughts on some of those games?

1149
01:44:33,883 --> 01:44:35,104
[SPEAKER_00]: Beatmania, of course, was great.

1150
01:44:35,144 --> 01:44:38,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, can you believe I got my first AAA on the stage in front of like a bajillion people?

1151
01:44:39,046 --> 01:44:40,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, good deal.

1152
01:44:42,148 --> 01:44:46,471
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the other stuff, of course, Katamari Damashii was cool.

1153
01:44:48,012 --> 01:44:50,533
[SPEAKER_00]: Call of Cthulhu was really freaking awesome.

1154
01:44:50,733 --> 01:45:00,840
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got to play Popokurus, which is a new... Agitech got the license on that one, and they announced it at E3, and it was pretty awesome.

1155
01:45:00,860 --> 01:45:02,741
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a 2D RPG game.

1156
01:45:03,001 --> 01:45:08,745
[SPEAKER_00]: For anyone who's into the import scene or into anime, they probably are very familiar with this one since it's very, very big.

1157
01:45:09,586 --> 01:45:11,087
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually turned off the show.

1158
01:45:11,107 --> 01:45:11,948
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe that'll help.

1159
01:45:32,368 --> 01:45:32,948
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did.

1160
01:45:33,949 --> 01:45:34,869
[SPEAKER_00]: I already did.

1161
01:45:34,990 --> 01:45:49,000
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I looked at the... Actually, I focused on the Mario one in particular.

1162
01:45:49,020 --> 01:45:50,121
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a bunch of pictures.

1163
01:45:50,141 --> 01:45:51,282
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be up on the site soon.

1164
01:45:52,786 --> 01:45:58,890
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the other... I really didn't get to play them because of the injury to my hip from my car accident.

1165
01:45:59,390 --> 01:46:03,252
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried to play and it just ended up hurting way too badly.

1166
01:46:03,552 --> 01:46:05,173
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I do like the new mix of Jelly Kiss.

1167
01:46:05,193 --> 01:46:05,834
[SPEAKER_00]: That was pretty cool.

1168
01:46:05,974 --> 01:46:07,975
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually played Loki's Bootleg earlier.

1169
01:46:08,855 --> 01:46:09,355
[SPEAKER_14]: It wasn't so bad.

1170
01:46:09,395 --> 01:46:10,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you say Loki's Booty?

1171
01:46:11,036 --> 01:46:12,177
[SPEAKER_14]: No, Loki's Bootleg.

1172
01:46:13,037 --> 01:46:13,157
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh.

1173
01:46:14,778 --> 01:46:15,759
[SPEAKER_14]: We did not play my ass.

1174
01:46:15,779 --> 01:46:17,260
[SPEAKER_00]: You broke up and it sounded like booty.

1175
01:46:17,700 --> 01:46:19,321
[SPEAKER_14]: No, we did not play Loki's Booty.

1176
01:46:19,341 --> 01:46:19,681
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1177
01:46:20,754 --> 01:46:23,375
[SPEAKER_14]: What did you think of... Now, did you go down to Kenshiya Hall?

1178
01:46:23,415 --> 01:46:25,956
[SPEAKER_14]: We were just talking about some of the stuff we saw in Kenshiya Hall.

1179
01:46:26,776 --> 01:46:27,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

1180
01:46:27,096 --> 01:46:28,737
[SPEAKER_14]: And Red Octane's booth?

1181
01:46:28,757 --> 01:46:31,277
[SPEAKER_00]: The Red Octane's pads were ass-worthy.

1182
01:46:31,417 --> 01:46:33,018
[SPEAKER_00]: I played on the DDR game.

1183
01:46:33,078 --> 01:46:33,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Ha!

1184
01:46:33,458 --> 01:46:34,078
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get this.

1185
01:46:34,598 --> 01:46:35,579
[SPEAKER_13]: I outvoted here.

1186
01:46:35,799 --> 01:46:38,260
[SPEAKER_13]: I thought the Afterburner pads were awesome.

1187
01:46:38,620 --> 01:46:39,300
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?

1188
01:46:39,380 --> 01:46:44,381
[SPEAKER_00]: If they wanted to do a good pad, then Konami needs to release the DX pad for the US.

1189
01:46:44,922 --> 01:46:49,163
[SPEAKER_00]: Apart from that, I have not played on a single metal pad other than ones that are homemade.

1190
01:46:49,858 --> 01:46:50,739
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, Drew, Carameldansen

1191
01:47:17,780 --> 01:47:18,321
[SPEAKER_14]: RedOctane

1192
01:47:46,238 --> 01:47:47,399
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm okay with people bar-raving.

1193
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:51,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, but that goes to the same people who complain about using speed modifiers on DDR.

1194
01:47:51,721 --> 01:47:53,862
[SPEAKER_00]: If they didn't want to use it, they wouldn't have put it in the damn game.

1195
01:47:54,203 --> 01:47:54,383
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.

1196
01:47:54,923 --> 01:48:01,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, when people say, well, you know, oh, it shouldn't be there, blah, blah, blah, you use your speed modifiers in 2DX.

1197
01:48:01,487 --> 01:48:03,768
[SPEAKER_00]: What's wrong with using them in DDR?

1198
01:48:04,188 --> 01:48:04,388
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.

1199
01:48:04,509 --> 01:48:06,230
[SPEAKER_13]: And what's wrong with using the bar?

1200
01:48:06,250 --> 01:48:07,030
[SPEAKER_13]: Because the bar's there.

1201
01:48:07,991 --> 01:48:09,551
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's a cop-out.

1202
01:48:09,591 --> 01:48:10,352
[SPEAKER_00]: It means you're weak.

1203
01:48:12,447 --> 01:48:16,810
[SPEAKER_00]: You are weak and you rely on the bar for your support.

1204
01:48:16,830 --> 01:48:23,173
[SPEAKER_00]: You should stand on your own feet and beat the game yourself.

1205
01:48:23,853 --> 01:48:27,676
[SPEAKER_14]: I got sunburned.

1206
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:37,261
[SPEAKER_00]: I put sunblock everywhere except I forgot that my neckline with that shirt is just a little bit lower than I was thinking of because...

1207
01:48:37,879 --> 01:48:41,420
[SPEAKER_00]: I have this really cool shirt, but it sags just a little bit because it's just enough too big.

1208
01:48:42,080 --> 01:48:43,881
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I didn't put any on my neckline.

1209
01:48:44,121 --> 01:48:50,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And my shoulder was getting sore, and I thought it was from the shoulder strap on the camera rubbing up against my skin.

1210
01:48:51,203 --> 01:48:53,983
[SPEAKER_00]: Turned out I was sunburned, and it's actually a little swollen.

1211
01:48:54,003 --> 01:48:57,324
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it hurts.

1212
01:48:57,584 --> 01:48:59,125
[SPEAKER_13]: Did you do anything else in L.A.

1213
01:48:59,145 --> 01:49:00,325
[SPEAKER_13]: besides Disneyland and E3?

1214
01:49:02,159 --> 01:49:06,120
[SPEAKER_00]: Um... Um... We went to AI.

1215
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:08,361
[SPEAKER_00]: I played lots of pop-up music Iroha.

1216
01:49:08,381 --> 01:49:09,181
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1217
01:49:10,181 --> 01:49:13,202
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I just played all the, like, Goonies and all the anime stuff.

1218
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:16,863
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought Iroha was a little overrated, but that's just me.

1219
01:49:18,823 --> 01:49:24,425
[SPEAKER_00]: I played, um, the Beatmania 3 seventh final deal.

1220
01:49:24,725 --> 01:49:25,005
[SPEAKER_07]: Mm-hmm.

1221
01:49:25,425 --> 01:49:30,226
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I was waiting for Iroha, and it was really hard to hear, and it wasn't all that much fun.

1222
01:49:30,246 --> 01:49:30,506
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.

1223
01:49:31,509 --> 01:49:36,451
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I also, uh, we went to Roscoe's house to chicken and waffles on Wednesday.

1224
01:49:37,031 --> 01:49:42,333
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I had been really good on my eating all day because I was going to have some grits and country gravy.

1225
01:49:43,174 --> 01:49:45,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, the grits were substandard.

1226
01:49:46,275 --> 01:49:46,455
[SPEAKER_00]: Aww.

1227
01:49:46,515 --> 01:49:47,315
[SPEAKER_00]: Not good grits.

1228
01:49:47,475 --> 01:49:51,497
[SPEAKER_00]: However, the chicken livers were pretty awesome and so was the turkey, the, uh, chicken gravy.

1229
01:49:52,897 --> 01:49:53,398
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1230
01:49:53,538 --> 01:49:54,518
[SPEAKER_00]: I had fried chicken liver.

1231
01:49:55,238 --> 01:49:58,019
[SPEAKER_00]: And say what you will, fried chicken liver's good.

1232
01:49:58,039 --> 01:49:58,960
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like my comfort food.

1233
01:50:00,666 --> 01:50:02,727
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I don't think I'm brave enough to try one, but maybe someday.

1234
01:50:02,747 --> 01:50:04,527
[SPEAKER_14]: I used to eat the livers all the time.

1235
01:50:05,608 --> 01:50:06,808
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you sing anything at karaoke?

1236
01:50:07,689 --> 01:50:08,969
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually did, believe it or not.

1237
01:50:09,849 --> 01:50:18,413
[SPEAKER_00]: They had, you could choose Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese, Korean, and English songs.

1238
01:50:18,513 --> 01:50:25,015
[SPEAKER_00]: And I actually went on the Japanese list and found the opening to Lane on the Japanese list.

1239
01:50:25,055 --> 01:50:29,057
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a bunch of other songs that were sort of half new in Japanese, but this one was all in English, so I sang it.

1240
01:50:29,837 --> 01:50:29,977
[SPEAKER_07]: Hmm.

1241
01:50:30,501 --> 01:50:33,464
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was at the place on Thursday I would sing that one.

1242
01:50:36,146 --> 01:50:37,528
[SPEAKER_14]: Anything else you want to share about E3?

1243
01:50:37,868 --> 01:50:38,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Things you saw at E3?

1244
01:50:39,169 --> 01:50:40,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Stuff you want to share with our listeners?

1245
01:50:40,671 --> 01:50:43,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw the PS3 demo and the Xbox 360 demo.

1246
01:50:44,793 --> 01:50:48,637
[SPEAKER_00]: and I took a bajillion, bajillion pictures of the Playstation 3.

1247
01:50:48,677 --> 01:50:50,599
[SPEAKER_00]: The demos were pretty cool.

1248
01:50:50,619 --> 01:50:56,164
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a motocross game that had a pretty excellent demo to it.

1249
01:50:56,344 --> 01:51:00,848
[SPEAKER_00]: They did a demonstration for the new Tekken thing with Jin and he was all sweaty.

1250
01:51:00,868 --> 01:51:02,290
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, ooh, sweaty Jin.

1251
01:51:02,850 --> 01:51:04,232
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, pictures of that online.

1252
01:51:04,432 --> 01:51:06,113
[SPEAKER_00]: I played the crap out of Nintendogs.

1253
01:51:07,415 --> 01:51:08,776
[SPEAKER_00]: I played Frisbee with the puppies.

1254
01:51:09,366 --> 01:51:10,907
[SPEAKER_12]: They have sweaty gin online.

1255
01:51:11,927 --> 01:51:12,167
[SPEAKER_00]: Huh?

1256
01:51:12,648 --> 01:51:14,689
[SPEAKER_12]: A picture of sweaty gin online.

1257
01:51:16,189 --> 01:51:20,211
[SPEAKER_12]: It's on IGN and it's super big so you can see all the sweat and pores and everything.

1258
01:51:20,711 --> 01:51:21,992
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, hooray.

1259
01:51:23,713 --> 01:51:24,653
[SPEAKER_14]: Are you on the site yet?

1260
01:51:24,693 --> 01:51:25,053
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you know?

1261
01:51:25,774 --> 01:51:26,594
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't checked.

1262
01:51:26,654 --> 01:51:28,695
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been home for all of two and a half hours.

1263
01:51:29,155 --> 01:51:30,796
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll have to check some of that out and let us know.

1264
01:51:30,936 --> 01:51:37,339
[SPEAKER_00]: It was long enough for me to post my picture, which I'm going to link in the chat room of the reject false icon sticker on Pac-Man's mouth.

1265
01:51:38,280 --> 01:51:38,660
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1266
01:51:41,306 --> 01:51:44,248
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a lot of stuff on the Katamari.

1267
01:51:44,588 --> 01:51:54,911
[SPEAKER_14]: I ended up getting four mouse pads and I gave one to Iguana Girl because she didn't get one.

1268
01:51:55,512 --> 01:51:59,493
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave one to Julie because she was nice and babysat my big fat cat.

1269
01:52:01,187 --> 01:52:02,488
[SPEAKER_00]: and I kept two for myself.

1270
01:52:02,528 --> 01:52:03,468
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to take one to work.

1271
01:52:03,909 --> 01:52:13,413
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually managed to snag three and I am going to give one to somebody but the other one I'm actually going to give away on the show at a later date.

1272
01:52:13,854 --> 01:52:17,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've still got stuff to add to the bag of swag.

1273
01:52:17,315 --> 01:52:17,475
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep.

1274
01:52:19,719 --> 01:52:20,540
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't.

1275
01:52:20,580 --> 01:52:21,980
[SPEAKER_14]: Why don't you go ahead and tell them?

1276
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,421
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're planning on doing a contest.

1277
01:52:24,441 --> 01:52:28,362
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not really sure how we're going to make you embarrass yourselves for stuff.

1278
01:52:28,482 --> 01:52:31,763
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, a lot of this swag is going for bucks on eBay.

1279
01:52:31,803 --> 01:52:34,384
[SPEAKER_00]: I found out those slimes are going for $40 a piece.

1280
01:52:34,604 --> 01:52:35,865
[SPEAKER_14]: The what is going for $40?

1281
01:52:36,205 --> 01:52:39,166
[SPEAKER_00]: The slimes that they were giving out at the square picture thing.

1282
01:52:39,526 --> 01:52:39,746
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my gosh.

1283
01:52:39,806 --> 01:52:40,186
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

1284
01:52:40,206 --> 01:52:42,867
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can like just order them from Japan for like $5.

1285
01:52:42,907 --> 01:52:44,087
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to sell mine now.

1286
01:52:45,308 --> 01:52:47,108
[SPEAKER_14]: How much are those Beatmania t-shirts going for?

1287
01:52:47,909 --> 01:52:48,389
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, um...

1288
01:52:49,147 --> 01:52:51,430
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you what, we've got Julie over here on eBay right now.

1289
01:52:51,450 --> 01:52:52,972
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any of the Beat Mania t-shirts up there?

1290
01:52:54,494 --> 01:52:55,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me take a look here.

1291
01:52:55,555 --> 01:52:56,616
[SPEAKER_00]: She's actually found one.

1292
01:52:57,277 --> 01:52:57,637
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my God.

1293
01:52:57,657 --> 01:52:58,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see how much it is on eBay.

1294
01:53:00,359 --> 01:53:02,521
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, like I'm ever going to give mine to anybody.

1295
01:53:02,681 --> 01:53:02,981
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1296
01:53:03,081 --> 01:53:06,805
[SPEAKER_14]: I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes.

1297
01:53:07,485 --> 01:53:13,651
[SPEAKER_14]: I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes for my Beatmania shirt, and I said, this is the one thing I'm keeping for myself.

1298
01:53:13,991 --> 01:53:23,520
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, I got yelled at for getting a Karaoke Revolution shirt for somebody else, because I had this total bitch yell at me saying, you dug your claws into me to get that shirt.

1299
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,440
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't even touch her.

1300
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,681
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know what the hell she was smoking.

1301
01:53:25,902 --> 01:53:27,403
[SPEAKER_14]: And then her boyfriend called me an asshole.

1302
01:53:27,918 --> 01:53:30,000
[SPEAKER_14]: The DS trailer for Twilight Princess is going for $76 right now.

1303
01:53:30,060 --> 01:53:30,300
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh my gosh.

1304
01:53:30,340 --> 01:53:33,823
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, if you got a press kit from Nintendo, they actually have a DS cartridge with the Zelda trailer on it.

1305
01:53:33,843 --> 01:53:35,344
[SPEAKER_14]: The Metal Gear Solid... Oh, what is this?

1306
01:53:50,477 --> 01:53:51,618
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still looking for this shirt.

1307
01:53:52,078 --> 01:53:55,680
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone put their stupid Tylenol Ouch shirt on.

1308
01:53:55,700 --> 01:53:58,922
[SPEAKER_00]: We're giving out free massages at the Tylenol Ouch booth.

1309
01:53:58,942 --> 01:54:01,103
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a really cute massage.

1310
01:54:01,223 --> 01:54:05,485
[SPEAKER_12]: You know those glossy things that they were giving out for free at Konami's booth?

1311
01:54:06,065 --> 01:54:07,246
[SPEAKER_12]: Metal Gear Solid 4?

1312
01:54:07,506 --> 01:54:10,148
[SPEAKER_12]: Those are going for $10 a piece.

1313
01:54:11,488 --> 01:54:12,289
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got two of those.

1314
01:54:12,869 --> 01:54:13,629
[SPEAKER_12]: I have two of those as well.

1315
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:14,390
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should put one on eBay.

1316
01:54:14,410 --> 01:54:14,570
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

1317
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:16,940
[SPEAKER_00]: Or maybe we should put one in the bag of swag.

1318
01:54:16,960 --> 01:54:24,122
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes, we're going to give away a bag of swag, which could end up being worth hundreds of dollars by the time... We don't want the promo.

1319
01:54:24,542 --> 01:54:26,062
[SPEAKER_12]: We love Katamari Mousepad, $5.

1320
01:54:26,162 --> 01:54:26,362
[SPEAKER_12]: Wow.

1321
01:54:26,402 --> 01:54:31,123
[SPEAKER_12]: DS Stylus for Mario Kart, $10.

1322
01:54:31,283 --> 01:54:34,624
[SPEAKER_14]: I will try to get a picture of the Beatmania shirt a little later.

1323
01:54:34,724 --> 01:54:37,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, all it is... I actually have... I'll tell you what.

1324
01:54:37,585 --> 01:54:39,345
[SPEAKER_00]: I have mine still rolled up.

1325
01:54:39,405 --> 01:54:40,725
[SPEAKER_00]: I took a picture of it in the bag.

1326
01:54:40,885 --> 01:54:41,185
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-huh.

1327
01:54:42,066 --> 01:54:42,886
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll try to...

1328
01:54:44,232 --> 01:54:45,713
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dinner and going to see episode 3.

1329
01:54:45,753 --> 01:54:48,034
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a little Konami one in the front over where your heart would be.

1330
01:54:48,054 --> 01:54:48,314
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had one.

1331
01:54:48,334 --> 01:54:49,354
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a freaking Beatmania shirt.

1332
01:54:49,374 --> 01:54:49,975
[SPEAKER_00]: What more do you need?

1333
01:54:49,995 --> 01:54:50,295
[SPEAKER_14]: In the USA.

1334
01:54:50,315 --> 01:54:50,715
[SPEAKER_14]: It was really cool.

1335
01:55:10,740 --> 01:55:22,311
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as we find a way to properly embarrass our listeners to get swag, we are compiling a bag of swag for you guys, and we will send that to whoever the lucky winner is.

1336
01:55:22,371 --> 01:55:31,199
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to go on eBay like some people do, because I'm laughing at whoever's bidding on some of this crap, although I'm sort of getting ideas now to take advantage of this.

1337
01:55:32,881 --> 01:55:34,822
[SPEAKER_00]: And according to Julie, hardly any of it's being bid on.

1338
01:55:36,361 --> 01:56:03,259
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's kind of people are expecting more from eBay than they're actually going to get I went off earlier and people said in the chat room I was actually sounding like you because I went off for a few minutes on Konami supporting their US audience and what they did at E3 really shows that they support their US audience by bringing in the Groovaloos I was going to ask what was your opinion on the Groovaloos and what they were doing

1339
01:56:03,911 --> 01:56:06,333
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that they were cool, and one of them was on Roundhouse.

1340
01:56:07,934 --> 01:56:09,155
[SPEAKER_14]: He wasn't actually dancing, though.

1341
01:56:09,255 --> 01:56:10,436
[SPEAKER_14]: He was the MC guy.

1342
01:56:11,057 --> 01:56:12,358
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, I remembered him.

1343
01:56:13,118 --> 01:56:13,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1344
01:56:13,659 --> 01:56:18,162
[SPEAKER_00]: I remembered, you know, once it was mentioned to me, I was like, oh, yeah, that is him, isn't it?

1345
01:56:20,344 --> 01:56:22,265
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, I was really impressed with them.

1346
01:56:22,305 --> 01:56:23,126
[SPEAKER_00]: They were great.

1347
01:56:24,067 --> 01:56:29,271
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and it was just even, you know, and there were people, you know, you know one of them won the giveaway?

1348
01:56:29,711 --> 01:56:29,971
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1349
01:56:30,812 --> 01:56:31,993
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were people complaining, and

1350
01:56:32,855 --> 01:56:39,379
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually came back and heard about that later, about them complaining about them winning, but they don't work for Konami.

1351
01:56:39,399 --> 01:56:42,761
[SPEAKER_00]: They were employed by Konami simply for E3.

1352
01:56:43,702 --> 01:56:49,365
[SPEAKER_14]: You know that they actually ended up, the powers that be at Konami, ended up vetoing that win, and somebody else walked away with it.

1353
01:56:50,045 --> 01:56:51,046
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, that's really crappy.

1354
01:56:51,066 --> 01:56:54,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Which, by the way, the most unenthusiastic winners ever...

1355
01:56:54,881 --> 01:57:09,530
[SPEAKER_14]: By the way, Konami, not only did they bring in the Groovaloos, we forgot to completely mention this, they actually gave away every day a 30-inch high-definition television set, all of their Revolution games, and what else was it?

1356
01:57:10,010 --> 01:57:10,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Was it DVD?

1357
01:57:10,651 --> 01:57:14,373
[SPEAKER_14]: No, it was a sound system, a Logitech super nice surround sound system.

1358
01:57:14,753 --> 01:57:18,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Every day they gave one of these away to the most unenthusiastic winners I've ever seen in my life.

1359
01:57:20,564 --> 01:57:22,265
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I found my pictures of the Cybersex game.

1360
01:57:22,405 --> 01:57:30,647
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just another example about how Konami supports their US audience because they gave away thousands of dollars in prizes to promote DDR.

1361
01:57:34,289 --> 01:57:34,549
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1362
01:57:36,669 --> 01:57:41,011
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 360 faceplate that someone got and that's going for $100 on eBay right now.

1363
01:57:41,151 --> 01:57:43,291
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I heard about that, the 360 faceplate.

1364
01:57:44,272 --> 01:57:45,852
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro racers are going for money too.

1365
01:57:45,872 --> 01:57:48,413
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, I saw those.

1366
01:57:49,187 --> 01:57:51,408
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything else you want to share with us, DarkSakura?

1367
01:57:52,589 --> 01:57:55,711
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really, um, haha, we got to go to E3.

1368
01:57:57,492 --> 01:57:59,393
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, seriously, it was really good.

1369
01:57:59,453 --> 01:58:02,375
[SPEAKER_00]: I got very worn out walking all over the place.

1370
01:58:02,435 --> 01:58:03,796
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm sunburned from Disneyland.

1371
01:58:05,061 --> 01:58:12,006
[SPEAKER_00]: But in about two minutes, you guys should be able to check out the picture of the Beatmania shirt in my swag bag.

1372
01:58:12,066 --> 01:58:16,488
[SPEAKER_14]: Somebody posted somebody else at the show wearing one, but go ahead and post your picture anyway.

1373
01:58:16,649 --> 01:58:17,789
[SPEAKER_14]: Give them a nice chance to see it.

1374
01:58:17,809 --> 01:58:19,590
[SPEAKER_00]: Mine's actually the rolled up one.

1375
01:58:19,690 --> 01:58:25,114
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, my free copy of the Magic the Gathering online card game.

1376
01:58:25,674 --> 01:58:26,054
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.

1377
01:58:27,535 --> 01:58:30,517
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll be tossing in a Katamari mouse pad.

1378
01:58:31,704 --> 01:58:38,106
[SPEAKER_00]: and actually I don't have, I gave away my spare styluses so if you've got an extra or something.

1379
01:58:38,786 --> 01:58:47,048
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've got some stuff that we can throw in the bag and I did, by the way, check the Nintendo press kit, which I did get a copy of.

1380
01:58:47,368 --> 01:58:49,869
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually autographed stickers in there by Miyamoto.

1381
01:58:50,229 --> 01:58:50,429
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, cool.

1382
01:58:50,649 --> 01:58:54,910
[SPEAKER_14]: Were you able to look up, if you have a Nintendo press kit, I don't know if you have any information on DDR Mario Mix.

1383
01:58:55,030 --> 01:58:55,550
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not there.

1384
01:58:55,831 --> 01:58:56,611
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, for Mario Mix?

1385
01:58:57,051 --> 01:58:57,231
[SPEAKER_00]: Nope.

1386
01:58:58,326 --> 01:58:59,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Have it right here.

1387
01:58:59,066 --> 01:59:00,587
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get to that page one more time.

1388
01:59:00,647 --> 01:59:01,747
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really fast.

1389
01:59:02,907 --> 01:59:03,808
[SPEAKER_00]: It got a large page.

1390
01:59:04,168 --> 01:59:05,968
[SPEAKER_00]: Donkey Konga 2.

1391
01:59:06,929 --> 01:59:07,769
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here we go.

1392
01:59:07,789 --> 01:59:08,629
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll read you what it says.

1393
01:59:08,729 --> 01:59:09,690
[SPEAKER_14]: I played Donkey Konga 2.

1394
01:59:10,030 --> 01:59:11,650
[SPEAKER_14]: You know what song I played in Donkey Konga 2?

1395
01:59:11,990 --> 01:59:14,951
[SPEAKER_14]: Headstrong, which is some rock song.

1396
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:17,052
[SPEAKER_14]: I was like, what the hell is this doing in Donkey Konga?

1397
01:59:17,072 --> 01:59:17,592
[SPEAKER_14]: But it was cool.

1398
01:59:17,632 --> 01:59:17,892
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever.

1399
01:59:18,352 --> 01:59:20,453
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me read the little blurb on here, okay?

1400
01:59:21,213 --> 01:59:21,413
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.

1401
01:59:21,633 --> 01:59:27,075
[SPEAKER_00]: Mario must recover the stolen music keys before the unstable power of music destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom.

1402
01:59:27,771 --> 01:59:34,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Shake your thing to over 25 dance-flavored songs from classic Nintendo themes to familiar favorites and recover the missing keys.

1403
01:59:35,233 --> 01:59:38,694
[SPEAKER_00]: With five difficulty levels, dancers of all abilities can get into the groove.

1404
01:59:38,994 --> 01:59:41,554
[SPEAKER_00]: The special workout feature tracks the calories burned while playing.

1405
01:59:41,594 --> 01:59:43,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Strut your moves and break a sweat to the beat.

1406
01:59:44,275 --> 01:59:44,615
[SPEAKER_00]: No date.

1407
01:59:45,575 --> 01:59:47,936
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do remember being told sometime this fall.

1408
01:59:48,316 --> 01:59:50,957
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm almost positive we're going to see October, November.

1409
01:59:50,997 --> 01:59:53,357
[SPEAKER_00]: I have stickers autographed by Miyamoto in this thing.

1410
01:59:54,658 --> 01:59:55,338
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to meet him.

1411
01:59:56,078 --> 01:59:56,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, did you?

1412
01:59:56,458 --> 01:59:56,578
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1413
01:59:57,237 --> 02:00:00,380
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran into him, well actually, he was actually walking away from Kanai.

1414
02:00:01,441 --> 02:00:05,444
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be able to get the picture he sent us because we actually need to go because we've got to eat before going to the movie.

1415
02:00:05,464 --> 02:00:05,704
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.

1416
02:00:05,924 --> 02:00:06,185
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1417
02:00:07,025 --> 02:00:18,014
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did get to meet him and I got to, you know, actually we were about to collide so I said, and he looked really surprised and said thank you and have a good time.

1418
02:00:18,034 --> 02:00:18,394
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.

1419
02:00:18,614 --> 02:00:19,155
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.

1420
02:00:19,724 --> 02:00:20,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, good job.

1421
02:00:20,505 --> 02:00:22,288
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, um, did you get a chance to meet Togo?

1422
02:00:23,049 --> 02:00:23,489
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I didn't.

1423
02:00:23,870 --> 02:00:25,372
[SPEAKER_14]: Aw, I got a picture with Togo.

1424
02:00:25,492 --> 02:00:25,913
[SPEAKER_14]: He was cool.

1425
02:00:26,374 --> 02:00:26,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1426
02:00:26,994 --> 02:00:32,943
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um... We are off to go see, uh, episode three.

1427
02:00:33,103 --> 02:00:33,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, have fun.

1428
02:00:33,964 --> 02:00:36,228
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh...

1429
02:00:37,566 --> 02:00:38,967
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, I can't be at this show tonight.

1430
02:00:39,027 --> 02:00:42,790
[SPEAKER_00]: I only got back like... I have one more thing to add, Jamie.

1431
02:00:44,051 --> 02:00:50,757
[SPEAKER_12]: It was just announced today on PSP Hacker that someone's working on a PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

1432
02:00:51,858 --> 02:00:53,579
[SPEAKER_00]: PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

1433
02:00:54,420 --> 02:00:55,160
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to see this.

1434
02:00:56,001 --> 02:00:57,582
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought you'd like that.

1435
02:00:57,862 --> 02:01:01,045
[SPEAKER_14]: We're going to let you go, Jamie, but have fun at the movie, okay?

1436
02:01:01,065 --> 02:01:03,207
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good time.

1437
02:01:03,347 --> 02:01:04,128
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, everybody.

1438
02:01:04,428 --> 02:01:05,509
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you next week, right?

1439
02:01:06,549 --> 02:01:07,110
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see you next week?

1440
02:01:07,728 --> 02:01:09,109
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, and reject false icons.

1441
02:01:09,289 --> 02:01:09,969
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, see ya.

1442
02:01:10,750 --> 02:01:11,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.

1443
02:01:11,110 --> 02:01:11,510
[SPEAKER_14]: Bye.

1444
02:01:13,171 --> 02:01:19,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that was DarkSakura, who's not here tonight, but she was able to bless us with her presence anyway, one way or another.

1445
02:01:20,811 --> 02:01:23,592
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see, what we're going to do is we're going to take a break.

1446
02:01:24,733 --> 02:01:29,275
[SPEAKER_14]: Karaoke Party we still got to talk about a little bit because we haven't really, somebody in the chat room is asking about it right now.

1447
02:01:29,315 --> 02:01:30,255
[SPEAKER_14]: We never really did get to that.

1448
02:01:30,596 --> 02:01:31,716
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll talk about Karaoke Party.

1449
02:01:31,756 --> 02:01:35,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I want to talk about a new music game coming to your cell phone.

1450
02:01:36,119 --> 02:01:37,579
[SPEAKER_14]: I hinted about this one earlier.

1451
02:01:37,619 --> 02:01:39,400
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a brand new music game coming to your cell phone.

1452
02:01:39,981 --> 02:01:42,522
[SPEAKER_14]: I'll talk about that when we come back after a quick break.

1453
02:01:43,294 --> 02:01:44,234
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's do that break.

1454
02:01:44,954 --> 02:01:50,296
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll start it off with In the Heat of the Night, which is going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

1455
02:01:51,076 --> 02:01:52,316
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be back with more.

1456
02:01:52,696 --> 02:01:54,557
[SPEAKER_14]: This is just going to be a potpourri break, I think.

1457
02:01:55,597 --> 02:01:59,178
[SPEAKER_14]: And we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

1458
02:02:00,839 --> 02:02:01,999
[SPEAKER_08]: In the Heat of the Night

1459
02:02:19,899 --> 02:02:21,402
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks for watching!

1460
02:03:53,415 --> 02:03:55,044
I'm a bitch, where do you want to get stuck?

1461
02:03:55,104 --> 02:03:56,633
[SPEAKER_08]: I did it, we did it, hell yeah, man, we did it

1462
02:04:25,806 --> 02:04:27,207
[SPEAKER_08]: You've got to breathe your mind

1463
02:05:41,904 --> 02:05:43,186
Music Music Music Music

1464
02:06:09,517 --> 02:06:10,297
Thanks for watching!

1465
02:06:49,503 --> 02:06:56,049
[SPEAKER_09]: Remix Remix Remix Remix Remix

1466
02:07:47,825 --> 02:08:00,595
[SPEAKER_04]: Solid Snake Solid Snake Solid Snake Can you hear what I'm saying?

1467
02:08:00,836 --> 02:08:08,882
[SPEAKER_04]: Well it's time to kick a man that wants a bag I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all Down, what am I gonna do?

1468
02:08:08,902 --> 02:08:09,883
[SPEAKER_04]: Down, what am I gonna do?

1469
02:08:12,033 --> 02:08:13,234
[SPEAKER_04]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1470
02:08:15,515 --> 02:08:18,757
[SPEAKER_04]: We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.

1471
02:08:18,797 --> 02:08:20,878
[SPEAKER_04]: It's true, it's true, it's true.

1472
02:08:38,348 --> 02:08:48,351
[SPEAKER_14]: We are back and we are going to open up the Skype line, you guys, so you guys can call in and talk to us and ask us questions and give us your feedback on what you think about the various releases at E3 as well.

1473
02:08:48,732 --> 02:08:49,772
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're going to get to that.

1474
02:08:49,852 --> 02:08:54,414
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want more details on how you can be a part of that, www.orangelongeradio.com.

1475
02:08:54,734 --> 02:08:56,194
[SPEAKER_14]: Click on Interact With Us.

1476
02:08:56,854 --> 02:09:05,437
[SPEAKER_14]: But first, I want to give you guys a few notes on some other little game releases that they had at E3 on some other games that are coming out.

1477
02:09:06,518 --> 02:09:07,198
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero.

1478
02:09:07,731 --> 02:09:12,013
[SPEAKER_14]: Guitar Hero, they weren't showing anything at Red Octane's booth to the public.

1479
02:09:12,813 --> 02:09:19,376
[SPEAKER_14]: And in fact, when I asked about it, or when Loki asked about it, we kind of got the runaround just saying, oh, well, we'll have more information out soon to the press.

1480
02:09:19,416 --> 02:09:20,456
[SPEAKER_14]: I can't say anything right now.

1481
02:09:21,417 --> 02:09:27,259
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, turns out they're actually showing the game behind closed doors, and one of our staffers got back there anyway.

1482
02:09:28,420 --> 02:09:30,340
[SPEAKER_14]: So we can't tell you about Guitar Hero.

1483
02:09:31,381 --> 02:09:32,721
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I'll let you talk about this one.

1484
02:09:32,741 --> 02:09:33,902
[SPEAKER_14]: You're a big guitar fan.

1485
02:09:34,505 --> 02:09:37,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, this game, it's very similar to Amplitude.

1486
02:09:37,887 --> 02:09:41,769
[SPEAKER_12]: There's actually some wonderful screenshots online right now.

1487
02:09:41,809 --> 02:09:43,109
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it looks like Amplitude.

1488
02:09:43,790 --> 02:09:45,150
[SPEAKER_12]: In the middle, you've got all your stuff.

1489
02:09:45,170 --> 02:09:46,351
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of coming towards you.

1490
02:09:46,551 --> 02:09:52,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I wouldn't say it's exactly like Amplitude so much as it's Amplitude and Karaoke Revolution kind of combining with each other.

1491
02:09:52,114 --> 02:09:58,817
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you have to remember, Harmonix also helped with making Karaoke Revolution, so it's kind of obvious.

1492
02:09:59,137 --> 02:10:02,019
[SPEAKER_12]: It's more like Amplitude, only because the stuff's coming towards you.

1493
02:10:03,038 --> 02:10:04,179
[SPEAKER_12]: It's that sort of perspective.

1494
02:10:04,300 --> 02:10:12,410
[SPEAKER_12]: However, it is like Karaoke Revolution because on the side, there's a meter that's kind of a crowd meter, very similar to Karaoke Revolution.

1495
02:10:13,951 --> 02:10:15,553
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, it's five keys.

1496
02:10:16,314 --> 02:10:20,199
[SPEAKER_12]: However, depending on what difficulty you play, it's anywhere from three to five keys.

1497
02:10:21,521 --> 02:10:22,502
[SPEAKER_12]: I thought that was kind of cool.

1498
02:10:23,263 --> 02:10:40,949
[SPEAKER_14]: and now the songs that are going to be in it very similar to what Harmonix did before when they released Karaoke Revolution they were actually doing covers of classic songs they get these guys to go in the studio and re-record them same deal for Guitar Hero is what's going to happen same deal for Guitar Hero except for the ones obviously that are

1499
02:10:41,343 --> 02:10:43,184
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, that BeAGuitarHero.com.

1500
02:10:43,244 --> 02:10:44,544
[SPEAKER_14]: Right, BeAGuitarHero.com.

1501
02:10:44,584 --> 02:10:53,947
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have a friend who's in a band who might appreciate some exposure from being in this game, or you're one of these people, have them go check out this site, BeAGuitarHero.com.

1502
02:10:54,247 --> 02:10:59,308
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, considering how much you went off on Red Octane a little bit earlier, does this redeem them a little bit, you think?

1503
02:10:59,708 --> 02:11:01,209
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, I wasn't going off on Red Octane.

1504
02:11:01,249 --> 02:11:03,709
[SPEAKER_12]: I was going off on Rockser for the really crappy game.

1505
02:11:03,749 --> 02:11:06,290
[SPEAKER_12]: Red Octane, they're doing no bad because they're trying to actually...

1506
02:11:06,670 --> 02:11:10,771
[SPEAKER_12]: Distribute a dance game, which I give them credit for that, because at least they're trying to do something.

1507
02:11:11,271 --> 02:11:17,553
[SPEAKER_12]: I wish they'd picked a better game, but hey, when there's nothing else out there other than DDR, what are you going to do?

1508
02:11:18,713 --> 02:11:33,057
[SPEAKER_12]: But as far as them actually distributing this game, this is actually a very good move for them, because there are no other Guitar Freaks-type games, and I think this will actually exceed Guitar Freaks, which isn't that hard, since Guitar Freaks really hasn't changed much since Fifth Mix, so...

1509
02:11:34,301 --> 02:11:40,505
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, it's more of a challenge, and there is the same stuff in there that you would expect from Guitar Freaks.

1510
02:11:41,506 --> 02:11:45,148
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks like they've actually kind of got some hold notes in place.

1511
02:11:45,388 --> 02:11:54,934
[SPEAKER_12]: And from what I hear, the controller, even though it is 5-key, it actually allows you to slide your hand along the different buttons to be able to hit them easier.

1512
02:11:55,074 --> 02:11:58,156
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's actually like playing a guitar, which is nice.

1513
02:11:59,617 --> 02:12:01,078
[SPEAKER_12]: And I managed to...

1514
02:12:02,316 --> 02:12:07,358
[SPEAKER_12]: We need a little more information out of the guy when we're there asking him questions.

1515
02:12:07,778 --> 02:12:09,519
[SPEAKER_12]: All, of course, very vague answers.

1516
02:12:09,899 --> 02:12:16,081
[SPEAKER_12]: I asked him if there was going to be a drum hero type game, and they're all, we're working on something.

1517
02:12:16,522 --> 02:12:21,684
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, so maybe a drum game coming soon?

1518
02:12:22,264 --> 02:12:22,684
[SPEAKER_14]: Possibly.

1519
02:12:22,804 --> 02:12:23,284
[SPEAKER_12]: Possibly.

1520
02:12:25,325 --> 02:12:27,086
[SPEAKER_12]: So, that's something, and...

1521
02:12:28,692 --> 02:12:33,535
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely, there's some pretty cool shots, like I said, online, and we'll probably have some more on our website.

1522
02:12:33,595 --> 02:12:36,556
[SPEAKER_12]: We're hoping we can get some more exclusive shots for our website very soon, we'll see.

1523
02:12:36,976 --> 02:12:48,002
[SPEAKER_12]: And we're going to have those, probably, and it looks very similar to Carriker Revolution, just like, because you've got the CG guy on stage, the crowd, very similar, so it'll be interesting.

1524
02:12:48,202 --> 02:12:48,722
[SPEAKER_14]: Very interesting.

1525
02:12:50,287 --> 02:12:52,049
[SPEAKER_14]: Tycho Drummaster is available for your cell phone!

1526
02:13:12,848 --> 02:13:14,669
[SPEAKER_14]: This is something that they were showing at E3.

1527
02:13:14,729 --> 02:13:21,232
[SPEAKER_14]: Namco actually has a lot of cell phone games they're doing now, and one of their series they're pushing is Arcade Classics.

1528
02:13:21,952 --> 02:13:32,316
[SPEAKER_14]: The folks at Namco Cell were actually very nice to me, and I've got to admit, and they didn't have to be nice to me for me to say this, but their cell phone games are pretty nice, considering that they're cell phone games.

1529
02:13:32,636 --> 02:13:35,498
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, in the end, they're still games on your cell phone.

1530
02:13:35,838 --> 02:13:37,679
[SPEAKER_14]: They're not going to knock your socks off.

1531
02:13:37,739 --> 02:13:41,100
[SPEAKER_14]: It's not going to be a Game Boy quality game, but for a cell phone game,

1532
02:13:41,496 --> 02:13:42,297
[SPEAKER_14]: They're pretty cool.

1533
02:13:42,437 --> 02:13:45,619
[SPEAKER_14]: And in other news, the N-Gage arena, empty.

1534
02:13:46,019 --> 02:13:46,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1535
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:53,044
[SPEAKER_14]: The sad thing is, these Namco things running on Java on a cell phone is better than anything I've seen on an N-Gage.

1536
02:13:53,445 --> 02:13:56,947
[SPEAKER_12]: And honestly, I did walk through the N-Gage booth.

1537
02:13:57,007 --> 02:13:57,628
[SPEAKER_12]: I checked it out.

1538
02:13:57,908 --> 02:14:00,910
[SPEAKER_12]: They're releasing a new version of the N-Gage, N-Gage 2, I guess.

1539
02:14:01,070 --> 02:14:03,852
[SPEAKER_12]: I played Civilization on N-Gage and couldn't figure out what the heck I was doing.

1540
02:14:04,913 --> 02:14:07,275
[SPEAKER_12]: It's just... It's interesting.

1541
02:14:07,295 --> 02:14:07,335
[SPEAKER_12]: Um...

1542
02:14:08,659 --> 02:14:17,189
[SPEAKER_12]: I know there are other competitors out there that are not exactly engaged and not exactly a Sony product that are portable, that are probably doing better than they are.

1543
02:14:18,170 --> 02:14:22,335
[SPEAKER_12]: But hey, whatever, you know, they refuse to die, so at least let them try.

1544
02:14:22,375 --> 02:14:22,475
[SPEAKER_12]: But...

1545
02:14:27,325 --> 02:14:28,426
[SPEAKER_14]: Tycho Drummaster, how's this work?

1546
02:14:42,362 --> 02:14:54,204
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think this is something that's going to appeal to everybody, but, you know, for those of you guys that have wanted a music game to take with you on your cell phone, something to do when you're bored, Taiko Drum Master has a dozen songs from the original release.

1547
02:14:54,804 --> 02:14:58,725
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, granted, it's a cell phone, so it's not going to be the same quality, but still, you know, it's something.

1548
02:14:59,265 --> 02:15:06,727
[SPEAKER_14]: And it has the animation still and everything, and same types of rolls and combos and everything you remember from the original Taiko Drum Master.

1549
02:15:07,047 --> 02:15:08,047
[SPEAKER_14]: This is available now.

1550
02:15:08,567 --> 02:15:10,989
[SPEAKER_14]: They're saying, per their press release, it's available now.

1551
02:15:11,289 --> 02:15:11,810
[SPEAKER_14]: So check it out.

1552
02:15:11,850 --> 02:15:12,931
[SPEAKER_14]: See if your carrier has this.

1553
02:15:12,971 --> 02:15:20,658
[SPEAKER_14]: I imagine it's not available through all carriers, but I do know I'm a Sprint user myself, and we do have Namco releases on our cell phones.

1554
02:15:20,678 --> 02:15:22,499
[SPEAKER_14]: So I believe this should be there.

1555
02:15:22,539 --> 02:15:23,260
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm going to look for it.

1556
02:15:24,481 --> 02:15:27,584
[SPEAKER_12]: I have, what was it, AT&T.

1557
02:15:28,564 --> 02:15:30,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And I know they carry Namco stuff.

1558
02:15:30,796 --> 02:15:31,436
[SPEAKER_12]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1559
02:15:54,190 --> 02:15:57,052
[SPEAKER_12]: That I was looking for movie tickets on Fandango, thank you.

1560
02:15:57,793 --> 02:15:59,354
[SPEAKER_12]: And the picture cost me $7.

1561
02:15:59,974 --> 02:16:01,375
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you, AT&T.

1562
02:16:01,495 --> 02:16:03,176
[SPEAKER_12]: I will never use your web feature again.

1563
02:16:03,997 --> 02:16:10,381
[SPEAKER_14]: There's actually someone in our chat room saying that it's only on Verizon and available for a specific number of phones.

1564
02:16:10,521 --> 02:16:13,143
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see anything in their release that indicated that.

1565
02:16:14,524 --> 02:16:19,187
[SPEAKER_14]: But the lady at Namco was kind enough to give me her card, so I will write her and ask.

1566
02:16:20,208 --> 02:16:21,909
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe they're going to port it to others in the future, I don't know.

1567
02:16:22,289 --> 02:16:23,390
[SPEAKER_14]: I will write her and find out.

1568
02:16:24,013 --> 02:16:24,613
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I will do.

1569
02:16:25,334 --> 02:16:26,914
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's see.

1570
02:16:26,935 --> 02:16:29,196
[SPEAKER_14]: What else do we have?

1571
02:16:32,077 --> 02:16:33,698
[SPEAKER_14]: What was the other game I wanted to talk about?

1572
02:16:33,778 --> 02:16:35,059
[SPEAKER_14]: Karaoke Revolution Party.

1573
02:16:35,099 --> 02:16:36,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Did you look at this at all, Loki?

1574
02:16:36,719 --> 02:16:38,320
[SPEAKER_14]: I know you're a big Karaoke Revolution fan.

1575
02:16:38,340 --> 02:16:39,501
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh yeah, don't you know me.

1576
02:16:39,621 --> 02:16:40,841
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a huge Karaoke fan.

1577
02:16:40,861 --> 02:16:44,523
[SPEAKER_12]: No, I stayed far, far, far, far away from this game.

1578
02:16:46,464 --> 02:16:47,345
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, far away.

1579
02:16:47,505 --> 02:16:48,605
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not touch this game.

1580
02:16:48,665 --> 02:16:49,846
[SPEAKER_12]: I did not look at this game.

1581
02:16:50,346 --> 02:16:53,768
[SPEAKER_12]: I stayed far away like it was my kryptonite and I was Superman.

1582
02:16:56,209 --> 02:16:57,190
[SPEAKER_14]: XBOX, PLAYSTATION 2, GAME CUBE

1583
02:17:23,038 --> 02:17:52,078
[SPEAKER_14]: GameCube will be getting a Karaoke Revolution release for the first time so that was kind of a big news right there you will be able to get this on GameCube a little bit unclear if the sing and dance will be in the GameCube version but they will get at least the sing part I think they will get the dance part as well we'll see some of the songs that were in it the only ones I remember were Crazy in Love Material Girl was in it because I actually did that one Endless Love Play That Funky Music White Boy

1584
02:17:55,254 --> 02:17:56,477
[SPEAKER_14]: The interface has changed.

1585
02:17:56,617 --> 02:18:02,611
[SPEAKER_14]: This is why they're not calling it Karaoke Revolution 4, but they're actually calling it Karaoke Revolution Party, because they actually went and did some remodeling to the interface.

1586
02:18:02,947 --> 02:18:03,727
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

1587
02:18:26,317 --> 02:18:28,378
[SPEAKER_14]: Like, I know my material girl, okay?

1588
02:18:28,698 --> 02:18:33,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So I was able to easily do the sing and dance mode because I already know the lyrics and the melody and everything.

1589
02:18:33,441 --> 02:18:34,341
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't really need the bars.

1590
02:18:34,782 --> 02:18:38,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you have to, the way the dance mode works, it doesn't look like normal DDR.

1591
02:18:38,544 --> 02:18:44,267
[SPEAKER_14]: If you've ever played Karaoke Revolution, the bars scroll horizontally across the bottom of the screen.

1592
02:18:44,687 --> 02:18:45,648
[SPEAKER_14]: And then it guides your pitch.

1593
02:18:45,888 --> 02:18:49,850
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, the arrows show up and they scroll horizontally at the bottom of the screen as well.

1594
02:18:50,150 --> 02:18:51,031
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's a little different.

1595
02:18:53,212 --> 02:18:53,512
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1596
02:18:54,946 --> 02:18:56,187
[SPEAKER_14]: Dancing Stage Unleashed 2

1597
02:19:13,869 --> 02:19:15,130
[SPEAKER_12]: Actually, last week.

1598
02:19:16,350 --> 02:19:20,372
[SPEAKER_12]: Basically, for those who don't know, that is the UK version of Ultramix 2.

1599
02:19:21,452 --> 02:19:25,494
[SPEAKER_12]: And pretty much it's the same stuff that we had on Ultramix 2.

1600
02:19:25,674 --> 02:19:26,974
[SPEAKER_12]: Of course, new licensed stuff.

1601
02:19:27,915 --> 02:19:34,617
[SPEAKER_12]: With stuff featuring, like, I See You Baby, which I have no idea what that is.

1602
02:19:34,697 --> 02:19:35,337
[SPEAKER_12]: Hot stuff.

1603
02:19:36,138 --> 02:19:37,638
[SPEAKER_12]: Hip teens don't wear blue jeans.

1604
02:19:37,778 --> 02:19:41,560
[SPEAKER_12]: Is that that I See You Baby, Shakin' That Ass, isn't that song?

1605
02:19:42,205 --> 02:19:42,945
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet it's that song.

1606
02:19:43,005 --> 02:19:44,185
[SPEAKER_12]: I bet it is that song.

1607
02:19:44,286 --> 02:20:07,131
[SPEAKER_12]: A Town Called Malice, Circles, Get It On, and Hanging on the Telephone, which, very interesting enough, we actually do have, well, DDRUK being the ones that are on top of the ripping of different stuff for the Sim scene.

1608
02:20:07,491 --> 02:20:10,892
[SPEAKER_12]: So all the official stuff are already out for that, even though it was released like the other week.

1609
02:20:12,699 --> 02:20:16,171
[SPEAKER_12]: So we'll have some of that stuff to play for you guys pretty soon.

1610
02:20:16,693 --> 02:20:17,998
[SPEAKER_12]: And ICU Baby is...

1611
02:20:18,849 --> 02:20:21,592
[SPEAKER_12]: The one you think it is, and it's a Fatboy Slim radio edit.

1612
02:20:21,752 --> 02:20:23,854
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be pretty interesting.

1613
02:20:24,955 --> 02:20:28,238
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, we'll have some of those songs available for you pretty soon, actually.

1614
02:20:28,558 --> 02:20:28,978
[SPEAKER_12]: Sounds good.

1615
02:20:29,038 --> 02:20:29,779
[SPEAKER_12]: Maybe even a show.

1616
02:20:29,939 --> 02:20:35,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I want to put out there that Song Pack 11, I don't know if it's out, but at least it's been announced that it's coming out.

1617
02:20:36,925 --> 02:20:40,469
[SPEAKER_14]: I have not been able to get on Xbox Live in a couple weeks, so I have not seen myself.

1618
02:20:40,949 --> 02:20:43,551
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me, however.

1619
02:20:44,272 --> 02:20:44,893
[SPEAKER_14]: One way or the other.

1620
02:20:49,027 --> 02:21:01,197
[SPEAKER_12]: Diamond Jealousy by Akira Yamamoto, Guilty by DJ Setup, Helpless by Teiko, Hold On Me by Tiger Yamamoto, and Open the PA by Akira Yamamoto.

1621
02:21:07,054 --> 02:21:07,534
[SPEAKER_12]: Ishihara

1622
02:21:27,846 --> 02:21:28,967
[SPEAKER_14]: Now can we open up the Skype line?

1623
02:21:29,047 --> 02:21:29,227
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes.

1624
02:21:29,347 --> 02:21:30,087
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's do that.

1625
02:21:30,127 --> 02:21:30,848
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take some calls.

1626
02:21:30,908 --> 02:21:42,053
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to call in on the Skype line www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on Interact With Us and you can call us and talk to us and interact with us and ask us questions.

1627
02:21:42,093 --> 02:21:53,017
[SPEAKER_14]: If you have anything you want to know about E3 or you have any comments on a lot of the various news that's come out lately because there's been a lot of freaking news lately go ahead and let us know what's going on.

1628
02:21:54,078 --> 02:21:54,738
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's take a call.

1629
02:21:56,943 --> 02:21:57,924
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.

1630
02:21:57,944 --> 02:21:58,264
[SPEAKER_14]: Who's this?

1631
02:22:00,026 --> 02:22:02,007
[SPEAKER_16]: Uh, this is RPGKing7 up in Canada.

1632
02:22:02,187 --> 02:22:03,489
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, RPG... I'm surprised you got in.

1633
02:22:03,769 --> 02:22:08,032
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, yeah, I'm surprised... Well, you've been hammering us all night, so I'm not surprised you got in.

1634
02:22:08,313 --> 02:22:08,853
[SPEAKER_14]: No, that's alright.

1635
02:22:08,893 --> 02:22:09,614
[SPEAKER_14]: What's on your mind, bud?

1636
02:22:12,176 --> 02:22:14,438
[SPEAKER_16]: Um, well, I wish I had gotten down to E3.

1637
02:22:14,538 --> 02:22:20,663
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really jealous of you guys that you got to go there, but you live on the west coast, I'm out here on the east coast.

1638
02:22:21,484 --> 02:22:22,144
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, here it is.

1639
02:22:22,364 --> 02:22:25,267
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to know what E3 is like, you're up in Canada, right?

1640
02:22:26,068 --> 02:22:30,513
[SPEAKER_14]: Start walking to LA, and when you get to LA, you'll know what it feels like to be at E3.

1641
02:22:30,533 --> 02:22:37,801
[SPEAKER_14]: Because you do nothing but walk around all day, and occasionally stopping to play a video game.

1642
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:41,081
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for watching!

1643
02:22:57,052 --> 02:23:01,533
[SPEAKER_14]: It's pretty neat because what you get to do is it looks like Symphony of the Night.

1644
02:23:01,673 --> 02:23:02,353
[SPEAKER_14]: It looks amazing.

1645
02:23:02,433 --> 02:23:08,555
[SPEAKER_14]: Sound, I couldn't tell you because you can't hear a damn thing inside E3, but it looks very similar to Symphony of the Night.

1646
02:23:08,615 --> 02:23:15,176
[SPEAKER_14]: Basically, you play on the bottom part of the screen, and the top part of the screen is typically what would have been your subscreen in Symphony of the Night.

1647
02:23:15,576 --> 02:23:17,977
[SPEAKER_14]: You can flip it back and forth, though, between that and your map.

1648
02:23:18,377 --> 02:23:22,224
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool because I think that's sort of the type of game that DS was really made for.

1649
02:23:23,345 --> 02:23:27,172
[SPEAKER_14]: Also what you do is as you move through the game, when you get to certain points...

1650
02:23:28,155 --> 02:23:40,323
[SPEAKER_14]: You discover these magic seals And the magic seals are what you're supposed to do to defeat the boss So like the first one was very easy The first magic seal in the demo I played was just a little V shape You just draw a V, okay?

1651
02:23:40,563 --> 02:23:55,173
[SPEAKER_14]: So it teaches you how to draw the seal And then what happens is when you go and fight the boss When you beat the boss, the seal flies up on the screen And you have to draw the seal like you learned it And if you don't do it, you don't beat the boss And I think you have to do it all over So, yeah

1652
02:23:56,209 --> 02:23:57,450
[SPEAKER_16]: That actually sounds pretty cool, yeah.

1653
02:23:57,490 --> 02:23:58,411
[SPEAKER_16]: Nice use of the stylus.

1654
02:23:58,751 --> 02:24:04,416
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and I think it's using the stylus without being kind of cheesy about it like a lot of DS games to date have been.

1655
02:24:05,817 --> 02:24:11,501
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this will satisfy a lot of folks that have been wanting some new Castlevania that looks more like Symphony of the Night.

1656
02:24:12,082 --> 02:24:15,945
[SPEAKER_14]: This falls right along with the Castlevania Advance games.

1657
02:24:16,045 --> 02:24:17,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this will be a great addition to the series.

1658
02:24:19,768 --> 02:24:21,950
[SPEAKER_14]: And it continues the storyline of Aria of Sorrow as well, so...

1659
02:24:22,304 --> 02:24:25,549
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, which is really cool, because Arya of Sauron is one of my favorite ones.

1660
02:24:25,809 --> 02:24:29,234
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, and somebody in the chatroom is saying it's actually due out at the end of October.

1661
02:24:29,735 --> 02:24:35,763
[SPEAKER_14]: I would have guessed that it would have been out a lot sooner, because the game looked almost complete from what we saw, but I guess it wasn't.

1662
02:24:35,864 --> 02:24:38,928
[SPEAKER_14]: But it looked pretty well done, so maybe they're just waiting on it, I don't know.

1663
02:24:40,902 --> 02:24:51,810
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I was excited to hear that 1998 and In the Heat of the Night are going to be on Xtreme 2 because those are hands down two of my favorite songs on the Arcade Mix's Xtreme and Fifth Mix.

1664
02:24:51,851 --> 02:24:53,392
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm really excited to hear those are going to be on it.

1665
02:24:53,752 --> 02:24:56,674
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, you could hear the giant hooray.

1666
02:24:57,095 --> 02:24:58,556
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, it was kind of a mixed reaction.

1667
02:24:58,576 --> 02:25:09,104
[SPEAKER_14]: It was a hooray and dope kind of coming from the crowd when you saw that In the Heat of the Night was on Xtreme 2 because the people that like Erotic, yay, finally we get Erotic, and then the other people that hate Erotic are like, nah.

1668
02:25:10,206 --> 02:25:11,904
[SPEAKER_14]: But I, for one, am happy about it.

1669
02:25:13,482 --> 02:25:15,303
[SPEAKER_16]: I also wanted to ask you about Phantasy Star Universe.

1670
02:25:15,343 --> 02:25:17,224
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sure you've covered a lot of this on the podcast.

1671
02:25:17,264 --> 02:25:19,345
[SPEAKER_16]: I've only gotten to listen to the Wednesday podcast.

1672
02:25:19,665 --> 02:25:20,366
[SPEAKER_14]: A little bit.

1673
02:25:20,406 --> 02:25:21,506
[SPEAKER_14]: We talked about it a little bit.

1674
02:25:21,666 --> 02:25:24,828
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually played one of them.

1675
02:25:24,928 --> 02:25:26,609
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it was Phantasy Star Universe I played.

1676
02:25:26,649 --> 02:25:28,610
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard they were showing another one in the Sega Theater.

1677
02:25:28,630 --> 02:25:29,070
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.

1678
02:25:29,411 --> 02:25:31,712
[SPEAKER_14]: I did play Phantasy Star Universe a little bit.

1679
02:25:32,852 --> 02:25:35,714
[SPEAKER_14]: It's very different from the online.

1680
02:25:35,774 --> 02:25:38,115
[SPEAKER_14]: The way it moves is very different.

1681
02:25:38,676 --> 02:25:40,877
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot more action-packed.

1682
02:25:41,557 --> 02:25:44,219
[SPEAKER_14]: I think than the previous Phantasy Star Online, at least the one I played.

1683
02:25:44,560 --> 02:26:01,834
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually did a fight with a dragon, and I was playing with three other computer-controlled players, and I really couldn't get a sense of whether this one's supposed to be online or what the deal is, but the party I had was computer-controlled, and we were all just beating up on this thing, and it was pretty challenging.

1684
02:26:02,535 --> 02:26:02,615
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1685
02:26:03,351 --> 02:26:08,776
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot more action-packed than I think the Phantasy Star Online was.

1686
02:26:09,677 --> 02:26:10,478
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kind of different.

1687
02:26:10,918 --> 02:26:13,261
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't go into it expecting Phantasy Star Online 2.

1688
02:26:13,341 --> 02:26:15,323
[SPEAKER_14]: They've changed some things in it a little bit.

1689
02:26:16,023 --> 02:26:16,944
[SPEAKER_14]: But I liked it.

1690
02:26:17,064 --> 02:26:18,826
[SPEAKER_14]: It was kind of fast-paced and I liked that.

1691
02:26:18,886 --> 02:26:21,028
[SPEAKER_14]: I think there needed to be more fast-paced online games.

1692
02:26:21,288 --> 02:26:22,630
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, cool.

1693
02:26:23,491 --> 02:26:27,675
[SPEAKER_16]: Because one thing I've always didn't like about Phantasy Star Online is it's a little slow.

1694
02:26:28,665 --> 02:26:52,582
[SPEAKER_16]: at least in my opinion it's kind of slow I think you'll be satisfied with Phantasy Star Universe then they've really kind of upped the pace a little bit I also want to go to Kingdom Hearts 2 looks amazing I've been following all the games on GameStop and GameTrailers.com both of them have gotten really good E3 coverage over the few days Kingdom Hearts 2 I checked out as well did you play Kingdom Hearts 2 at all, Loki?

1695
02:26:53,760 --> 02:26:54,400
[SPEAKER_14]: No, he's saying no.

1696
02:26:55,081 --> 02:26:56,381
[SPEAKER_14]: Kingdom Hearts 2 I actually played.

1697
02:26:56,441 --> 02:27:00,344
[SPEAKER_14]: They had two, actually four levels playable in the E3 demo.

1698
02:27:00,664 --> 02:27:02,104
[SPEAKER_14]: Two boss battles and two levels.

1699
02:27:02,485 --> 02:27:05,926
[SPEAKER_14]: And both were either the Mulan levels or the Hercules levels that you could play.

1700
02:27:06,347 --> 02:27:08,268
[SPEAKER_14]: The one I chose to play was the Hercules level.

1701
02:27:08,668 --> 02:27:10,989
[SPEAKER_14]: And you actually have Oren in your party when you're playing.

1702
02:27:11,449 --> 02:27:16,912
[SPEAKER_14]: It has this new mode called Drive Mode, where I guess you're building up this meter as you're playing.

1703
02:27:17,092 --> 02:27:18,393
[SPEAKER_14]: I couldn't really see how it was working.

1704
02:27:18,433 --> 02:27:20,034
[SPEAKER_14]: But I had not one, but two levels.

1705
02:27:20,523 --> 02:27:21,524
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1706
02:27:48,180 --> 02:27:49,780
[SPEAKER_14]: Zelda, Twilight Princess, just

1707
02:28:13,519 --> 02:28:14,219
[SPEAKER_16]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1708
02:28:37,827 --> 02:28:42,290
[SPEAKER_14]: All I know is that it is Link that turns into the wolf because we saw an extra clip of that.

1709
02:28:42,830 --> 02:28:44,571
[SPEAKER_14]: And what can I say?

1710
02:28:44,731 --> 02:28:48,093
[SPEAKER_14]: It's everything you Zelda fam boys and girls are wanting it to be.

1711
02:28:48,294 --> 02:28:49,554
[SPEAKER_14]: And I include myself in that.

1712
02:28:49,875 --> 02:28:51,075
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm looking forward to the game myself.

1713
02:28:53,537 --> 02:28:57,340
[SPEAKER_14]: It's the game they should have released three years ago if they wanted the GameCube to be super successful.

1714
02:28:57,400 --> 02:28:59,161
[SPEAKER_14]: But hey, better late than never, right?

1715
02:28:59,721 --> 02:28:59,941
[SPEAKER_16]: Right.

1716
02:29:00,962 --> 02:29:01,262
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1717
02:29:01,282 --> 02:29:03,164
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some other calls in, all right?

1718
02:29:03,624 --> 02:29:04,064
[SPEAKER_16]: Okay, all right.

1719
02:29:04,084 --> 02:29:05,165
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for listening to me.

1720
02:29:05,285 --> 02:29:05,885
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for calling.

1721
02:29:06,186 --> 02:29:06,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one.

1722
02:29:06,606 --> 02:29:06,806
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks.

1723
02:29:07,944 --> 02:29:09,945
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, so some E3 questions there, some various things.

1724
02:29:10,225 --> 02:29:16,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm actually surprised I actually played all the games he called in to ask about, because I didn't play that many games.

1725
02:29:16,507 --> 02:29:18,208
[SPEAKER_14]: There was a whole lot there I didn't see.

1726
02:29:18,808 --> 02:29:24,350
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys have any questions, you can give us a call on the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

1727
02:29:24,690 --> 02:29:26,891
[SPEAKER_14]: Click on Interact With Us, and you can actually call in.

1728
02:29:27,351 --> 02:29:31,392
[SPEAKER_14]: You have to download this program called Skype, but it allows you to call us for free.

1729
02:29:31,833 --> 02:29:32,633
[SPEAKER_14]: We like free things.

1730
02:29:32,653 --> 02:29:33,273
[SPEAKER_14]: Free!

1731
02:29:33,433 --> 02:29:34,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, let's go to another call.

1732
02:29:34,614 --> 02:29:35,554
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1733
02:29:36,209 --> 02:29:37,132
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey Sky, Siggy here.

1734
02:29:37,232 --> 02:29:38,476
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello Siggy, what's on your mind?

1735
02:29:39,178 --> 02:29:41,805
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'm about to beat Mania USA.

1736
02:29:42,046 --> 02:29:43,310
[SPEAKER_14]: I knew you'd have something to say about this.

1737
02:29:43,891 --> 02:29:44,092
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah.

1738
02:29:44,693 --> 02:29:46,794
[SPEAKER_15]: Big credits to Jason Enos for that.

1739
02:29:47,294 --> 02:29:47,894
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.

1740
02:29:47,934 --> 02:29:50,635
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos.

1741
02:29:50,675 --> 02:29:52,275
[SPEAKER_14]: We didn't get an interview with him this year.

1742
02:29:52,395 --> 02:29:54,616
[SPEAKER_14]: I talked to him off the record about some things.

1743
02:29:54,976 --> 02:29:57,217
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't want to talk about everything we talked about on air.

1744
02:29:58,017 --> 02:30:01,578
[SPEAKER_14]: But one thing I mentioned was that, you know what, way to go.

1745
02:30:02,158 --> 02:30:06,059
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm so happy that B-Manian is here and you're going to make a lot of people very happy with this.

1746
02:30:06,099 --> 02:30:12,601
[SPEAKER_14]: And his response to me was something like, yeah, well, you know, I've been trying for six years and it's finally here, so I'm happy too.

1747
02:30:13,757 --> 02:30:19,060
[SPEAKER_14]: So, absolutely, send Jason Enos some flowers if you kids are happy about this, because this is great.

1748
02:30:20,501 --> 02:30:27,546
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and when I saw the song list for 5-piece, oh, Old School Beat Mania.

1749
02:30:27,866 --> 02:30:30,728
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that not a cool feature for us in the U.S.

1750
02:30:30,768 --> 02:30:31,128
[SPEAKER_14]: to have?

1751
02:30:31,368 --> 02:30:31,988
[SPEAKER_14]: Is that not cool?

1752
02:30:32,008 --> 02:30:32,729
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, hell yes.

1753
02:30:32,989 --> 02:30:36,071
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, what a way to acknowledge...

1754
02:30:36,872 --> 02:30:37,432
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1755
02:30:55,583 --> 02:31:10,493
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, about, you know, I recently saw a picture on DDR Freak, someone posted the greetings for, you know, some Light Seven song, and like 167,000 points for a triple A, that's kind of ridiculous.

1756
02:31:11,293 --> 02:31:18,998
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, I, again, I wouldn't, I heard of that too, and I saw that picture as well, and I triple A'd a song as well, I wouldn't,

1757
02:31:20,118 --> 02:31:23,320
[SPEAKER_14]: Take those ranking things as gospel just yet.

1758
02:31:23,500 --> 02:31:24,581
[SPEAKER_14]: It is an early build.

1759
02:31:24,701 --> 02:31:28,423
[SPEAKER_14]: The thing was stuck in beginner mode, really, even though it didn't look like it.

1760
02:31:30,144 --> 02:31:34,746
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how much they're going to futz with the grading system.

1761
02:31:34,766 --> 02:31:35,787
[SPEAKER_14]: It's too early to tell.

1762
02:31:36,827 --> 02:31:47,813
[SPEAKER_14]: I kind of would think they wouldn't touch it at all, and maybe just the fact that they were doing what they did by putting the beginner songs in there was what caused those mathematical things to come up with triple A's and what have you.

1763
02:31:48,554 --> 02:31:48,614
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1764
02:31:49,557 --> 02:31:51,540
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1765
02:32:07,228 --> 02:32:10,410
[SPEAKER_14]: La Bossanova de Fabian Shining Polaris Anything else you want to share?

1766
02:32:10,450 --> 02:32:10,790
[SPEAKER_14]: Other E3 things?

1767
02:32:10,830 --> 02:32:11,230
[SPEAKER_14]: Observations?

1768
02:32:11,250 --> 02:32:12,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, just only Beatmania

1769
02:32:36,710 --> 02:32:37,690
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just happy with that.

1770
02:32:38,210 --> 02:32:38,451
[SPEAKER_14]: I know.

1771
02:32:39,091 --> 02:32:48,333
[SPEAKER_14]: A lot of us people that have been 2DX fans for a long time, and I've just been a casual 2DX fan, a lot of you guys are being very hardcore, a lot more hardcore than I am.

1772
02:32:48,593 --> 02:32:51,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I think this is great that you guys are finally getting this.

1773
02:32:51,434 --> 02:32:52,694
[SPEAKER_14]: All of us are getting this.

1774
02:32:55,435 --> 02:32:58,196
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't really been checking a whole lot of web forums and stuff.

1775
02:32:58,276 --> 02:32:59,776
[SPEAKER_14]: What has the reaction to this been?

1776
02:32:59,816 --> 02:33:02,717
[SPEAKER_14]: Has it been overwhelmingly positive, like about time?

1777
02:33:03,317 --> 02:33:05,238
[SPEAKER_14]: Or are the skeptics already ready to

1778
02:33:05,899 --> 02:33:08,881
[SPEAKER_15]: DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

1779
02:33:31,500 --> 02:33:58,677
[SPEAKER_14]: what they were able to do with this is that they were actually able to kind of set the standard the way they wanted to by unveiling this at E3 and showing us all these cool new features I think if they had announced this a month ago and said we are going to show this at E3 and I think this is the reason why this didn't happen people would have made up what they wanted to be in the game and they would have been disappointed when they didn't get that

1780
02:33:59,461 --> 02:34:08,449
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think by Konami unveiling it, you know, by keeping it a secret and then unveiling it at the very end and showing this is what you are going to get, look at all these amazing things, it kind of curved that a little bit.

1781
02:34:08,609 --> 02:34:10,811
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it kind of helped the reaction overall.

1782
02:34:11,051 --> 02:34:13,273
[SPEAKER_14]: So I can't blame Konami at all for trying to keep this a secret.

1783
02:34:13,353 --> 02:34:13,713
[SPEAKER_14]: And they did.

1784
02:34:13,933 --> 02:34:16,075
[SPEAKER_14]: This obviously has been worked on for quite some time.

1785
02:34:17,596 --> 02:34:23,258
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, actually, something we were actually clued in on, but we wanted to keep it a secret, but I can talk about it now.

1786
02:34:23,638 --> 02:34:30,880
[SPEAKER_14]: I gave you guys a hint last week about it, though, but actually, Konami registered the patent for Beatmania some time ago in the US.

1787
02:34:30,900 --> 02:34:31,701
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, I read that.

1788
02:34:32,001 --> 02:34:41,304
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, yeah, so, um, I, somebody had asked me to talk about it on this show, but kind of knowing that Konami, um,

1789
02:34:41,964 --> 02:34:49,171
[SPEAKER_14]: If they were going to put out this game, would want to keep it a secret, I decided, or we all decided really, that we should just kind of wait and see what happens with it.

1790
02:34:49,732 --> 02:34:51,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Because otherwise people will just start making stuff up.

1791
02:34:51,974 --> 02:34:56,878
[SPEAKER_14]: So, it's a good thing.

1792
02:35:00,542 --> 02:35:01,543
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, anything else you want to share?

1793
02:35:03,024 --> 02:35:04,225
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, nothing much else.

1794
02:35:05,273 --> 02:35:13,778
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to share something, one of our comments in the chatroom, MPQ says, no matter how much it sucks, buy it, just so Konami knows people will buy Beatmania here.

1795
02:35:14,999 --> 02:35:25,326
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh yeah, about the controller, the US release of the controller, were you the one who mentioned some improvements that would happen?

1796
02:35:26,192 --> 02:35:27,593
[SPEAKER_14]: and DarkSakura.com

1797
02:35:49,851 --> 02:35:52,094
[SPEAKER_14]: I think we will see some improvements made to the controller.

1798
02:35:52,495 --> 02:35:57,642
[SPEAKER_14]: Because they're going to have to redo the controller anyway to get the 2DX logo off the turntable.

1799
02:35:58,363 --> 02:36:00,987
[SPEAKER_14]: So why not fix the sticky key thing while you're at it?

1800
02:36:01,287 --> 02:36:03,751
[SPEAKER_14]: I would say that we're going to see some improvements.

1801
02:36:04,335 --> 02:36:13,477
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be nice if they put microswitches on it, like cheap microswitches, not exactly from the arcade type of microswitches, you know, prevent the sticking.

1802
02:36:13,677 --> 02:36:18,678
[SPEAKER_14]: That's an interesting thought, completely change the way that the buttons, kind of, the sensor system, basically.

1803
02:36:19,138 --> 02:36:23,039
[SPEAKER_14]: So, I'll be interesting, I'd be interested to see that.

1804
02:36:24,079 --> 02:36:28,680
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and if they do put microswitches, I would buy it, I would buy it, definitely.

1805
02:36:30,239 --> 02:36:56,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I think what's interesting is that a lot of I need a new 2DX controller very badly for my import copies but now that I've heard that Beatmania is coming out in the USA I'm just kind of going to wait for the US controllers to come out because there's no sense in paying $100 to import a controller now when they're going to release them here probably $40-$50 I don't know, don't take my word on that who knows how much these things are going to cost but it'll be cheaper than importing it, that's for sure

1806
02:36:59,006 --> 02:37:12,676
[SPEAKER_15]: Speaking of beat me, setting that aside, about PlayStation 3, I read from either IGN or GameSpot that they have 6 USB ports, are they really replacing the old controller port for that?

1807
02:37:13,957 --> 02:37:15,278
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't read up on PS3.

1808
02:37:15,298 --> 02:37:15,919
[SPEAKER_14]: What do you know about this?

1809
02:37:15,939 --> 02:37:17,380
[SPEAKER_14]: It had a lot of USB ports.

1810
02:37:17,420 --> 02:37:23,946
[SPEAKER_12]: I know just for the pictures of it, it's got a buttload of... Well, it's also got a bunch of weird things to it.

1811
02:37:24,627 --> 02:37:29,892
[SPEAKER_12]: For one, it's got two HDTV outsides, so you can actually have two HDTV setups.

1812
02:37:30,492 --> 02:37:34,536
[SPEAKER_12]: One for the actual gameplay and one for almost like a dual screen.

1813
02:37:34,596 --> 02:37:35,517
[SPEAKER_12]: Like a DS, basically.

1814
02:37:35,537 --> 02:37:37,619
[SPEAKER_12]: Like a DS, yeah.

1815
02:37:37,879 --> 02:37:38,560
[SPEAKER_12]: It's going to have...

1816
02:37:40,413 --> 02:37:42,394
[SPEAKER_12]: I saw three Ethernet ports on there.

1817
02:37:42,434 --> 02:37:47,297
[SPEAKER_12]: Now, I don't know what the hell that's about either, but it's just a lot of weird stuff on there.

1818
02:37:47,417 --> 02:37:50,379
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm actually pulling up the picture right now for my reference.

1819
02:37:51,740 --> 02:37:54,142
[SPEAKER_12]: But I remember also...

1820
02:37:55,143 --> 02:37:55,483
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

1821
02:37:55,583 --> 02:37:56,985
[SPEAKER_12]: It just looked interesting.

1822
02:37:57,185 --> 02:38:01,288
[SPEAKER_12]: I know that it's going to be Wi-Fi as well, but I don't see why you need so many damn USB ports.

1823
02:38:01,568 --> 02:38:04,410
[SPEAKER_12]: But then again, I don't know why you need so many damn USB ports on a computer.

1824
02:38:04,430 --> 02:38:09,594
[SPEAKER_14]: Now, it's going to be that we do know that every next-gen system is going to be wireless and their controllers and stuff.

1825
02:38:09,614 --> 02:38:14,078
[SPEAKER_14]: So I kind of assume that the USB ports are for four for controllers and two for...

1826
02:38:14,822 --> 02:38:16,924
[SPEAKER_14]: and whatever USB stuff you want to put in.

1827
02:38:17,865 --> 02:38:20,247
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's a good shot of the back here right now.

1828
02:38:20,327 --> 02:38:31,636
[SPEAKER_12]: And I see, I count them, three Ethernet ports, two USB ports, the AV out, which is like your standard AV out, the digital audio out, the two HDTV outs.

1829
02:38:32,097 --> 02:38:33,098
[SPEAKER_12]: That's only on the back.

1830
02:38:33,758 --> 02:38:37,081
[SPEAKER_12]: Then you've got, and I honestly don't know why there's three Ethernet ports.

1831
02:38:37,101 --> 02:38:38,162
[SPEAKER_12]: That makes no sense to me.

1832
02:38:38,242 --> 02:38:38,362
[SPEAKER_12]: But

1833
02:38:39,412 --> 02:38:48,103
[SPEAKER_12]: Whatever, and then as far as front ports go, I remember there's at least a couple USB ports that are underneath this little cover thing on the front.

1834
02:38:50,046 --> 02:38:51,507
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm trying to see if I can get a picture here.

1835
02:38:52,088 --> 02:38:55,693
[SPEAKER_12]: Anyways, yeah, so there's a ton of stuff on there.

1836
02:38:55,913 --> 02:38:58,256
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know why, but I'm sure they've got a reason for it.

1837
02:38:58,336 --> 02:39:02,757
[SPEAKER_14]: I think, okay, you have to remember with the next gen systems too, what everybody is doing, not just Microsoft.

1838
02:39:02,777 --> 02:39:04,517
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft's kind of been saying they're going to do this.

1839
02:39:04,877 --> 02:39:08,618
[SPEAKER_14]: They're going to expand and not just be about gaming, right?

1840
02:39:08,658 --> 02:39:12,739
[SPEAKER_14]: Microsoft wants to be an entertainment center where you can download music and do things like that.

1841
02:39:12,779 --> 02:39:19,740
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think you're going to see this on a lot of the next gen systems that there's more things to plug in there for your media setup at home than just your controllers.

1842
02:39:20,041 --> 02:39:21,821
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think that's kind of what this is all about on PS3.

1843
02:39:22,819 --> 02:39:28,181
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, and then I saw, you know, and then I read they're going to replace memory cards with memory stick duos.

1844
02:39:29,602 --> 02:39:31,363
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't think they would do that.

1845
02:39:31,403 --> 02:39:32,924
[SPEAKER_12]: Probably USB drives of anything.

1846
02:39:33,684 --> 02:39:34,024
[SPEAKER_12]: Who knows?

1847
02:39:34,064 --> 02:39:34,384
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll see.

1848
02:39:36,125 --> 02:39:38,686
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can just get to some other stuff on the show.

1849
02:39:39,346 --> 02:39:39,527
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.

1850
02:39:39,667 --> 02:39:40,587
[SPEAKER_14]: But have a good one, buddy, okay?

1851
02:39:41,127 --> 02:39:41,387
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1852
02:39:41,668 --> 02:39:41,868
[SPEAKER_14]: Later.

1853
02:39:41,968 --> 02:39:42,188
[SPEAKER_12]: Later.

1854
02:39:42,988 --> 02:39:45,069
[SPEAKER_12]: I do know what some of those USB ports are going to be used for.

1855
02:39:45,789 --> 02:39:46,890
[SPEAKER_12]: Interfacing with your PSP.

1856
02:39:48,305 --> 02:39:50,887
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, that and wireless is going to be poor, too.

1857
02:39:51,127 --> 02:39:51,867
[SPEAKER_14]: You can bet on that.

1858
02:39:52,047 --> 02:39:53,608
[SPEAKER_12]: Guys, imagine the member of the Pocket Station.

1859
02:39:53,788 --> 02:39:57,470
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, I met most of you that don't remember that, but that's what they're going to do.

1860
02:39:57,490 --> 02:39:57,790
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

1861
02:39:58,482 --> 02:40:03,184
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, what we're going to do now is we're actually not tonight going to have a cage match.

1862
02:40:03,204 --> 02:40:04,525
[SPEAKER_14]: We actually kind of ran out of time.

1863
02:40:04,765 --> 02:40:09,267
[SPEAKER_14]: And also, even though DarkSakura was able to send me her file, we're just running out of time.

1864
02:40:09,307 --> 02:40:10,167
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have time to do it.

1865
02:40:10,207 --> 02:40:12,749
[SPEAKER_14]: We figured you guys would want to know the E3 coverage more than that.

1866
02:40:13,129 --> 02:40:16,250
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll table the cage match to next week.

1867
02:40:17,031 --> 02:40:20,812
[SPEAKER_14]: But we can't possibly get through a show without doing some FUs of the week.

1868
02:40:21,753 --> 02:40:25,054
[SPEAKER_14]: So let's get into the FUs of the week if we can here.

1869
02:40:27,941 --> 02:40:34,343
[SPEAKER_14]: Loki, I did get some from Jamie, so I'll go ahead and start off with hers, FUs of the Week here.

1870
02:40:34,423 --> 02:40:35,863
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we go.

1871
02:40:36,603 --> 02:40:40,024
[SPEAKER_14]: If you guys want to send in your FUs of the Week, send a private message to Sky in the chat room.

1872
02:40:40,404 --> 02:40:46,086
[SPEAKER_14]: And after the FUs of the Week, we'll go back to the Skype line and do some Ask Orange Lounge, actually, as well.

1873
02:40:46,546 --> 02:40:48,927
[SPEAKER_14]: So here we go, the FUs of the Week.

1874
02:40:49,047 --> 02:40:51,147
[SPEAKER_14]: Why is it, Loki, that we do the FUs every single week?

1875
02:40:51,408 --> 02:40:52,748
[SPEAKER_12]: Because we have to.

1876
02:40:58,775 --> 02:40:59,216
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1877
02:41:00,877 --> 02:41:10,126
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura would like to say an F you to Drama and Sunburns and the Fast Pass being turned off for Roger Rabbit.

1878
02:41:12,168 --> 02:41:12,549
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.

1879
02:41:13,009 --> 02:41:14,911
[SPEAKER_12]: Loki, your F yous of the week.

1880
02:41:16,176 --> 02:41:25,501
[SPEAKER_12]: My first F you goes to Audioslave for having this giant concert in the middle of Hollywood and Highland, and that really sucked.

1881
02:41:27,382 --> 02:41:39,328
[SPEAKER_12]: And also, fuck you to E3, or mainly just the convention hall, for stopping accepting credit cards after a certain time.

1882
02:41:39,947 --> 02:42:05,318
[SPEAKER_12]: and it's like during the middle of lunch rush, they're just like, yeah, we just don't want to do credit cards, we're going to do cash only, of course you don't realize that until after you've gotten your food, so you're fucked if you don't have cash, luckily I, you know, had cash, so that was no problem, and basically also fuck you the Motel 6 for their crappy beds, because they're just uncomfortable as hell, and yeah, that's

1883
02:42:06,142 --> 02:42:14,147
[SPEAKER_12]: Fuck you to Rockstar for not actually showing any of their games and wasting a big space in E3.

1884
02:42:14,908 --> 02:42:20,011
[SPEAKER_12]: And also to Nintendo for not having a revolution there because I wanted to see that.

1885
02:42:21,712 --> 02:42:22,032
[SPEAKER_12]: That's it.

1886
02:42:23,613 --> 02:42:23,933
[SPEAKER_14]: My turn.

1887
02:42:29,000 --> 02:42:42,251
[SPEAKER_14]: F you to that bitch at Konami's booth, not working there, somebody who was an observer, that said I tried to dig my nails into her over a t-shirt, and she whined and complained like a little baby and got her boyfriend mad at me.

1888
02:42:42,692 --> 02:42:46,635
[SPEAKER_14]: I was so stunned that somebody would be so trite that I didn't even know what to say back.

1889
02:42:47,015 --> 02:42:50,138
[SPEAKER_14]: But if I could say anything back, I would say something along these lines.

1890
02:42:51,419 --> 02:42:55,062
[SPEAKER_14]: Your girlfriend is lying to you about me digging my nails into her.

1891
02:42:55,122 --> 02:42:55,963
[SPEAKER_14]: She is making it up.

1892
02:42:56,641 --> 02:43:01,043
[SPEAKER_14]: She's probably lying to you about being monogamous with you as well.

1893
02:43:02,444 --> 02:43:04,705
[SPEAKER_14]: So screw you, lady and stupid boyfriend.

1894
02:43:04,745 --> 02:43:06,026
[SPEAKER_14]: How dare you call me an asshole.

1895
02:43:06,767 --> 02:43:08,508
[SPEAKER_14]: I wish my posse was there to beat you up.

1896
02:43:10,929 --> 02:43:17,272
[SPEAKER_14]: Also, I'd like to give an F you to $8 hamburgers at E3 that aren't even that good.

1897
02:43:17,793 --> 02:43:23,776
[SPEAKER_14]: And having to wait in line for 45 minutes, I'm not even kidding, 45 minutes to get a freaking hamburger is horrible.

1898
02:43:26,010 --> 02:43:31,072
[SPEAKER_14]: So an F you to the fact that the next two days I had to eat lunch at 10.30 if I wanted to avoid lines.

1899
02:43:31,293 --> 02:43:31,733
[SPEAKER_14]: Horrible.

1900
02:43:32,373 --> 02:43:36,215
[SPEAKER_14]: And even then we had to wait like, what, 15 minutes for a pizza that one day because I kept dropping them?

1901
02:43:36,576 --> 02:43:44,280
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, the second day we got pizza, dumb bitch there didn't even understand how to cook pizza, which was quite funny because I loved just watching it.

1902
02:43:44,710 --> 02:44:06,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Like, pulled over as they, like, hit the end and started backing up into the oven But I got my pizza, and thank you to the stupid Mexican bitch Um, she, um, gave me sort of food poisoning, so I had bad gas all day long Thank you, thank you, thank you But the pizza's still good, even though it's doughy Alright, let's go on to the chatroom FUs, shall we?

1903
02:44:06,898 --> 02:44:11,620
[SPEAKER_14]: I actually haven't gotten a whole lot of chatroom FUs This might be a short segment tonight, we'll see

1904
02:44:14,526 --> 02:44:16,988
[SPEAKER_14]: MPQ says, F you to my wireless mouse.

1905
02:44:17,128 --> 02:44:18,048
[SPEAKER_14]: The receiver broke.

1906
02:44:18,769 --> 02:44:23,192
[SPEAKER_14]: Now I have this mouse that works perfectly except for the fact that it can't be plugged into the computer.

1907
02:44:24,052 --> 02:44:26,074
[SPEAKER_14]: Also an F you to Shaza Ambamani style.

1908
02:44:26,094 --> 02:44:26,954
[SPEAKER_14]: You're being a retard.

1909
02:44:26,974 --> 02:44:27,935
[SPEAKER_14]: You're pissing everyone off.

1910
02:44:27,995 --> 02:44:29,216
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop being stupid or go away.

1911
02:44:30,997 --> 02:44:34,720
[SPEAKER_14]: I avoid webform drama very much, so I don't know what to tell you on that one.

1912
02:44:37,722 --> 02:44:38,402
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's see.

1913
02:44:38,562 --> 02:44:40,504
[SPEAKER_14]: Next F you comes from Ron Chan.

1921
02:45:27,305 --> 02:45:29,026
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank God we're not in that time zone.

1922

[SPEAKER_14]: Crouton6 says, F you to Loki for hating in the groove.

1930
02:45:58,522 --> 02:45:59,882
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the power supplies suck.

1931
02:46:00,603 --> 02:46:01,083
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess so.

1932
02:46:01,183 --> 02:46:01,824
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, that's it.

1933
02:46:01,844 --> 02:46:02,844
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all the F yous we got.

1934
02:46:02,964 --> 02:46:04,445
[SPEAKER_14]: So, there you have it.

1935
02:46:04,665 --> 02:46:05,226
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, one more.

1936
02:46:05,486 --> 02:46:06,787
[SPEAKER_14]: One late one that just came in.

02:46:07,347 --> 02:46:08,068
[SPEAKER_14]: LemonLineJump.

02:46:10,969 --> 02:46:12,190
[SPEAKER_14]: I ruined my own Monday.

1940
02:46:13,491 --> 02:46:14,452
[SPEAKER_14]: How do you ruin your own Monday?

1941
02:46:17,093 --> 02:46:17,434
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

1942
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:19,235
[SPEAKER_14]: Um...

1943
02:46:21,573 --> 02:46:28,875
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess what we're going to do is do a quick break, then we'll come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge, because I'm sure you guys have some questions after E3.

1944
02:46:30,536 --> 02:46:36,758
[SPEAKER_14]: And to make Loki very happy with me, I think what we'll actually do in this break is play some music from In The Groove.

1945
02:46:38,479 --> 02:46:39,439
[SPEAKER_14]: Whatever, I don't care.

1946
02:46:40,279 --> 02:46:44,421
[SPEAKER_14]: So we'll be back after this quick break, just a couple songs here, and then we're going to do some Ask Orange Lounge.

1947
02:46:44,441 --> 02:46:48,162
[SPEAKER_14]: So send your questions over to Sky in the chat room, and we'll be back after this.

1948
02:46:54,834 --> 02:46:57,817
Come play with me Come play with me Come play with me

1949
02:47:41,367 --> 02:47:42,547
Free like a bird in the sky

1950
02:48:18,834 --> 02:48:19,694
Play with me!

1951
02:48:19,714 --> 02:48:20,795
Come play with me!

1952
02:48:20,815 --> 02:48:21,595
Come play with me!

1953
02:48:55,545 --> 02:48:56,206
Thank you.

1954
02:51:00,934 --> 02:51:04,135
[SPEAKER_14]: After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

1955
02:51:04,356 --> 02:51:06,517
[SPEAKER_08]: No!

1956
02:51:06,697 --> 02:51:07,357
[SPEAKER_14]: Just kidding.

1957
02:51:07,777 --> 02:51:08,818
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Lounge Radio.

1958
02:51:08,898 --> 02:51:10,518
[SPEAKER_14]: Crap-free Bavani Radio.

1959
02:51:11,919 --> 02:51:17,161
[SPEAKER_14]: Hello, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, wrapping things up here with a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

1960
02:51:17,221 --> 02:51:24,164
[SPEAKER_14]: In that break, you heard some in-the-groove music, Nina with Fly With Me, and Mind Reflection with Remember December.

1961
02:51:24,184 --> 02:51:25,285
[SPEAKER_14]: What was that last one?

1962
02:51:25,905 --> 02:51:27,426
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a fan favorite, believe it or not.

1963
02:51:27,566 --> 02:51:29,707
[SPEAKER_14]: I do not care for that song at all, but the fan's

1964
02:51:30,143 --> 02:51:31,124
[SPEAKER_14]: Ask me to play it, so I do.

1965
02:51:31,925 --> 02:51:32,485
[SPEAKER_14]: So there you have it.

1966
02:51:33,206 --> 02:51:34,487
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like the Fly With Me song, though.

1967
02:51:34,507 --> 02:51:35,107
[SPEAKER_14]: I do like that one.

1968
02:51:35,207 --> 02:51:36,829
[SPEAKER_14]: I just don't like Remember December, personally.

1969
02:51:39,351 --> 02:51:45,716
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's get into Ask Orange Lounge, where you guys, the listeners, get to control the show by sending us questions, and we answer them.

1970
02:51:45,796 --> 02:51:46,757
[SPEAKER_14]: It's just that simple.

1971
02:51:47,017 --> 02:51:49,099
[SPEAKER_14]: It's really an easy concept, honestly.

1972
02:51:55,704 --> 02:51:56,925
[SPEAKER_14]: Let's Ask Orange Lounge.

1973
02:51:57,498 --> 02:51:58,599
[SPEAKER_14]: some stupid question.

1974
02:51:59,119 --> 02:52:02,401
[SPEAKER_14]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

1975
02:52:02,901 --> 02:52:09,724
[SPEAKER_14]: I hope they have some questions to ask us about E3 and not so much random stuff this week because that gets annoying.

1976
02:52:11,305 --> 02:52:13,586
[SPEAKER_12]: I like how you add the extra syllable in orange.

1977
02:52:15,167 --> 02:52:23,171
[SPEAKER_14]: Orange Orange Look, that's the best thing I gotta do by improvising here.

1978
02:52:24,594 --> 02:52:27,837
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, at least you had better grammar than that one distribution company.

1979
02:52:29,198 --> 02:52:35,644
[SPEAKER_14]: Crouton6 wants to know, is there any known way to hook up my $400 2DX arcade-style controller to a freaking PS3?

1980
02:52:37,525 --> 02:52:48,015
[SPEAKER_14]: If PS3 is backwards compatible, which I believe they have said it will be, PS2 and PS1 backwards compatible, you can bet that there will be some type of converter that will turn one of the USB ports into a regular controller port.

1981
02:52:48,155 --> 02:52:48,595
[SPEAKER_14]: Guaranteed.

1982
02:52:48,615 --> 02:52:49,376
[SPEAKER_14]: There's got to be something.

1983
02:52:49,596 --> 02:52:51,478
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, otherwise you can't be backwards compatible, so...

1984
02:52:51,926 --> 02:52:57,171
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, yes, you can, because you can still play the old games with the DualShock sort of controllers.

1985
02:52:57,571 --> 02:52:59,413
[SPEAKER_12]: But here's the thing, though, what you can do.

1986
02:52:59,593 --> 02:53:08,782
[SPEAKER_12]: I know they have this, too, as some sort of Wi-Fi thing you plug into your normal controllers, and it's just like, you know, basically... There'll be a way.

1987
02:53:10,663 --> 02:53:11,184
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm sure.

1988
02:53:11,204 --> 02:53:11,884
[SPEAKER_14]: There'll be a way.

1989
02:53:11,924 --> 02:53:12,725
[SPEAKER_14]: There's got to be something.

1990
02:53:13,746 --> 02:53:16,529
[SPEAKER_14]: That's why you need to save your old PS2 and don't sell it.

1991
02:53:17,963 --> 02:53:22,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Illusion wants to know, were we supposed to set our watches an hour forward daylight savings time?

1992
02:53:22,725 --> 02:53:25,366
[SPEAKER_14]: About three weeks ago that happened, didn't it?

1993
02:53:25,946 --> 02:53:26,766
[SPEAKER_14]: I believe so.

1994
02:53:27,627 --> 02:53:28,907
[SPEAKER_14]: Spring forward, fall back, right?

1995
02:53:28,947 --> 02:53:30,008
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we did that a while ago.

1996
02:53:30,028 --> 02:53:30,808
[SPEAKER_14]: What the hell, dude?

1997
02:53:31,288 --> 02:53:33,989
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright, he says, I wasn't here for the first hour or two hours.

1998
02:53:34,069 --> 02:53:35,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know, I'm lost in time.

1999
02:53:35,270 --> 02:53:36,230
[SPEAKER_14]: I really don't know when I came in.

2000
02:53:36,590 --> 02:53:38,811
[SPEAKER_14]: Anyway, can you guys give me a quick summary on what happened?

2001
02:53:40,819 --> 02:53:44,481
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, for those of you who joined late, we talked about E3 and what we did.

2002
02:53:44,961 --> 02:53:50,724
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, actually, no, we can't tell you, but what you can do is you can check into the reruns that we play on DDR Freak Radio.

2003
02:53:50,744 --> 02:53:51,405
[SPEAKER_12]: There you go.

2004
02:53:51,465 --> 02:53:51,925
[SPEAKER_12]: Friday.

2005
02:53:52,005 --> 02:53:52,425
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2006
02:53:52,445 --> 02:53:53,146
[SPEAKER_14]: There you go.

2007
02:53:53,546 --> 02:53:54,427
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice plug there.

2008
02:53:54,467 --> 02:53:57,028
[SPEAKER_14]: You can listen to the Rewind on DDR Freak Radio Friday nights.

2009
02:53:58,358 --> 02:54:01,260
[SPEAKER_14]: Just to sum up, we talked Beatmania USA and the DDRs.

2010
02:54:01,540 --> 02:54:03,701
[SPEAKER_14]: We played a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

2011
02:54:03,741 --> 02:54:06,082
[SPEAKER_14]: And we gave away a million dollars and you didn't win.

2012
02:54:07,302 --> 02:54:10,123
[SPEAKER_14]: And we played the bootleg copy of the new MIDI head mix from Ultramix 3.

2013
02:54:10,824 --> 02:54:13,084
[SPEAKER_14]: And what was that song from Extreme 2?

2014
02:54:13,204 --> 02:54:14,625
[SPEAKER_14]: Plovotlian Dance and Chorus?

2015
02:54:14,805 --> 02:54:16,166
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.

2016
02:54:16,226 --> 02:54:16,826
[SPEAKER_14]: We played it.

2017
02:54:18,709 --> 02:54:24,493
[SPEAKER_14]: Dark Knight says, Sky, was the G4 bit with you guys for G4TV.com show or another show?

2018
02:54:24,974 --> 02:54:30,178
[SPEAKER_14]: Where you're going to see it, from what I understand, if they even use it, which I don't know, it's G4TV.com, the show.

2019
02:54:31,162 --> 02:55:00,582
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's like when they're coming back from commercial they'll probably show the booth and we're clapping and I'm wearing a bright ass green shirt and a t-shirt so you can't miss me and then Loki's standing right next to me and I don't remember what you were wearing that day I don't remember either and Mikotov was standing with us as well so you can see him too I don't remember no I think the last day of war it was like a just a normal shirt but yeah I had a bag an Xbox 360 bag I think I had one too

2020
02:55:01,660 --> 02:55:02,361
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, let's see.

2021
02:55:03,401 --> 02:55:05,623
[SPEAKER_14]: MPQ, should I bother going to Episode 3?

2022
02:55:06,103 --> 02:55:07,404
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you think it's worth the trouble?

2023
02:55:08,184 --> 02:55:09,225
[SPEAKER_14]: I haven't seen Episode 3.

2024
02:55:09,345 --> 02:55:10,886
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not, like, huge on Star Wars.

2025
02:55:11,306 --> 02:55:15,248
[SPEAKER_14]: I will see the movie, but I'm going to wait until the frenzy dies down.

2026
02:55:15,348 --> 02:55:18,050
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes, it's worth the trouble, from what I hear.

2027
02:55:19,030 --> 02:55:20,631
[SPEAKER_12]: It's what the fans have been looking for.

2028
02:55:21,592 --> 02:55:28,796
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, and also, in other news, War of the Worlds is supposed to be what people were expecting for Independence Day and Signs.

2029
02:55:29,346 --> 02:55:31,567
[SPEAKER_12]: In other words, it's not going to disappoint you.

2030
02:55:32,768 --> 02:55:33,828
[SPEAKER_12]: New trailer online, by the way.

2031
02:55:34,489 --> 02:55:34,989
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, really?

2032
02:55:35,669 --> 02:55:36,390
[SPEAKER_12]: It looks spiffy.

2033
02:55:36,510 --> 02:55:37,370
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll have to look into that.

2034
02:55:38,151 --> 02:55:39,472
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, let's see.

2035
02:55:39,972 --> 02:55:47,736
[SPEAKER_14]: VidPower, on a scale of 1 Sucktastic to 10 Fantastic, rate your overall E3 experience.

2036
02:55:50,438 --> 02:55:51,198
[SPEAKER_14]: I give mine a 7.

2037
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:55,981
[SPEAKER_14]: Honestly, I give mine about a 6.

2038
02:55:57,233 --> 02:55:57,433
[SPEAKER_14]: Ranchan

2039
02:56:26,428 --> 02:56:31,332
[SPEAKER_14]: RonChan says, OK Sky, please explain the ferret because I'm lost.

2040
02:56:31,372 --> 02:56:37,337
[SPEAKER_14]: The ferret is basically these little toys that we bought a long time ago.

2041
02:56:38,117 --> 02:56:41,500
[SPEAKER_14]: One of them was given to me as a Christmas present years ago.

2042
02:56:42,781 --> 02:56:44,742
[SPEAKER_14]: We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for like three years.

2043
02:56:45,263 --> 02:56:45,483
[SPEAKER_14]: Stop it.

2044
02:56:47,805 --> 02:56:49,406
[SPEAKER_14]: One of those was given to me like three years ago.

2045
02:56:49,526 --> 02:56:54,110
[SPEAKER_14]: And Jamie found it one show, like it was sitting on my dresser or something, and she started playing with it.

2046
02:56:54,130 --> 02:56:56,272
[SPEAKER_14]: And she was giggling and thought it was the cutest thing ever.

2047
02:56:56,752 --> 02:56:59,914
[SPEAKER_14]: And she hasn't stopped since.

2048
02:56:59,954 --> 02:57:01,175
[SPEAKER_12]: That was like two years ago.

2049
02:57:01,195 --> 02:57:04,738
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one day, just to be funny, I bought about six of them.

2050
02:57:05,299 --> 02:57:05,719
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I hate you.

2051
02:57:05,739 --> 02:57:08,801
[SPEAKER_12]: And I repaired them because they had dead batteries.

2052
02:57:08,841 --> 02:57:10,983
[SPEAKER_12]: So I had to cut them open and repair them.

2053
02:57:11,063 --> 02:57:13,265
[SPEAKER_12]: And then one of them got stuck on the Katamari.

2054
02:57:13,845 --> 02:57:14,586
[SPEAKER_14]: Where did you find...

2055
02:57:16,339 --> 02:57:17,700
[SPEAKER_12]: Those people want to buy them.

2056
02:57:18,060 --> 02:57:19,201
[SPEAKER_12]: You're not going to find them anywhere.

2057
02:57:19,221 --> 02:57:21,983
[SPEAKER_12]: They're called Scoozies is what they're called.

2058
02:57:22,143 --> 02:57:28,266
[SPEAKER_12]: It's like S-C-U-Z-Z or I-E or Z-I-E.

2059
02:57:28,366 --> 02:57:29,747
[SPEAKER_12]: You can find them on eBay.

2060
02:57:29,807 --> 02:57:30,808
[SPEAKER_12]: They're kind of expensive.

2061
02:57:31,608 --> 02:57:33,109
[SPEAKER_12]: But those are where I found them.

2062
02:57:33,169 --> 02:57:34,810
[SPEAKER_12]: I found them at Discount Toy Store.

2063
02:57:34,830 --> 02:57:38,472
[SPEAKER_12]: It's basically the discount outlet store for KB.

2064
02:57:39,013 --> 02:57:40,634
[SPEAKER_12]: And I bought what was left.

2065
02:57:40,714 --> 02:57:42,175
[SPEAKER_12]: And there was hardly anything left.

2066
02:57:42,235 --> 02:57:42,895
[SPEAKER_12]: And they were dead.

2067
02:57:43,724 --> 02:57:45,105
[SPEAKER_14]: I like Dark Knight's summary there.

2068
02:57:45,165 --> 02:57:47,307
[SPEAKER_14]: She uses the ferret to annoy Skye to death.

2069
02:57:47,467 --> 02:57:48,047
[SPEAKER_14]: Yep, you got it.

2070
02:57:48,507 --> 02:57:49,908
[SPEAKER_12]: Yep, you can find them on eBay.

2071
02:57:50,829 --> 02:57:53,591
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay, Ron Chan also wants to know, Loki, your favorite Nintendo character?

2072
02:57:54,351 --> 02:57:55,772
[SPEAKER_12]: My favorite Nintendo character?

2073
02:57:55,792 --> 02:58:00,135
[SPEAKER_12]: Um... I don't know.

2074
02:58:03,237 --> 02:58:04,338
[SPEAKER_12]: We'll just say Zelda.

2075
02:58:04,578 --> 02:58:05,038
[SPEAKER_12]: Or Link.

2076
02:58:05,359 --> 02:58:06,379
[SPEAKER_12]: Link's kind of cool.

2077
02:58:06,960 --> 02:58:08,961
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't have a really favorite Nintendo character.

2078
02:58:08,981 --> 02:58:12,964
[SPEAKER_12]: Unless you want to include... What's his name from...

2079
02:58:13,894 --> 02:58:16,656
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it Super Joe from Bionic Commando?

2080
02:58:16,676 --> 02:58:18,078
[SPEAKER_12]: Because technically he was on Nintendo.

2081
02:58:18,338 --> 02:58:22,321
[SPEAKER_14]: My favorite would be, without a doubt, the Eggplant Wizard, but not from the cartoon.

2082
02:58:22,761 --> 02:58:23,942
[SPEAKER_14]: Not the cartoon Eggplant Wizard.

2083
02:58:23,962 --> 02:58:24,943
[SPEAKER_14]: That guy was disgusting.

2084
02:58:25,323 --> 02:58:29,967
[SPEAKER_14]: The Eggplant Wizard, as portrayed in the original 8-bit Icarus, was awesome.

2085
02:58:31,128 --> 02:58:33,570
[SPEAKER_14]: If not the Eggplant Wizard, and that's why they need to make a new Kid Icarus.

2086
02:58:34,531 --> 02:58:35,772
[SPEAKER_14]: Please, please, Nintendo.

2087
02:58:35,812 --> 02:58:37,113
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty, pretty please with sugar on top.

2088
02:58:37,253 --> 02:58:37,614
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

2089
02:58:37,694 --> 02:58:38,354
[SPEAKER_14]: Put it on the DS.

2090
02:58:38,394 --> 02:58:38,714
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care.

2091
02:58:38,755 --> 02:58:39,375
[SPEAKER_14]: Just make me a new one.

2092
02:58:40,636 --> 02:58:42,357
[SPEAKER_14]: King Hippo, a close second.

2093
02:58:44,983 --> 02:58:47,685
[SPEAKER_14]: KingHippo was a badass.

2094
02:58:48,986 --> 02:58:51,228
[SPEAKER_14]: Doobs is asking, what happened with Kingdom Hearts 2?

2095
02:58:51,688 --> 02:58:52,769
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's too late for a question.

2096
02:58:52,809 --> 02:58:53,709
[SPEAKER_14]: No, you're not too late for a question.

2097
02:58:54,230 --> 02:58:57,572
[SPEAKER_14]: But I did talk about Kingdom Hearts 2 with a previous caller, so I hope you were listening.

2098
02:58:59,153 --> 02:59:04,757
[SPEAKER_14]: Again, Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like Kingdom Hearts 1, but with a better camera and Aurons in it, which is very cool.

2099
02:59:04,777 --> 02:59:06,659
[SPEAKER_12]: And it looks like the graphics are upgraded, too.

2100
02:59:06,779 --> 02:59:08,460
[SPEAKER_14]: And overdrive mode, or drive mode.

2101
02:59:09,000 --> 02:59:11,402
[SPEAKER_12]: It's really amazing, actually, what they've done with that engine, like,

2102
02:59:11,854 --> 02:59:14,896
[SPEAKER_12]: and thousands of characters on the screen at one time.

2103
02:59:15,396 --> 02:59:16,096
[SPEAKER_12]: It's pretty nice.

2104
02:59:17,277 --> 02:59:18,638
[SPEAKER_12]: So yeah, pretty awesome game.

2105
02:59:18,678 --> 02:59:19,718
[SPEAKER_12]: Definitely get it when it comes out.

2106
02:59:21,379 --> 02:59:21,680
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

2107
02:59:23,961 --> 02:59:24,421
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's it.

2108
02:59:24,481 --> 02:59:28,824
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all the questions we got tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.

2109
02:59:28,884 --> 02:59:29,424
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess that's it.

2110
02:59:30,104 --> 02:59:32,165
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, Dubz is confessing he wasn't there.

2111
02:59:32,225 --> 02:59:32,766
[SPEAKER_14]: He was gone.

2112
02:59:33,126 --> 02:59:34,447
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, that was the best part too.

2113
02:59:34,627 --> 02:59:35,547
[SPEAKER_12]: You just reminded me.

2114
02:59:36,148 --> 02:59:38,469
[SPEAKER_12]: Remember when they were having all the technical issues with...

2115
02:59:40,675 --> 02:59:46,940
[SPEAKER_12]: with more friends and the one guitarist from the Black Banjos on the guitar.

2116
02:59:47,180 --> 02:59:47,741
[SPEAKER_12]: That was awesome.

2117
02:59:47,761 --> 02:59:49,082
[SPEAKER_12]: That was pretty awesome.

2118
02:59:50,805 --> 02:59:51,305
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you for watching!

2119
03:00:11,591 --> 03:00:12,752
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2120
03:00:32,305 --> 03:00:33,845
[SPEAKER_14]: of the animations you see in the video.

2121
03:00:33,865 --> 03:00:35,786
[SPEAKER_12]: Which I will be using for my own reference.

2122
03:00:35,846 --> 03:00:36,526
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's the thing.

2123
03:00:36,946 --> 03:00:39,867
[SPEAKER_14]: They are in Photoshop format, super high quality.

2124
03:00:39,907 --> 03:00:47,408
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to build a website, get your hands one way or another on a Konami press kit because they've got these great Beatmania concepts.

2125
03:00:47,648 --> 03:00:51,609
[SPEAKER_14]: Just the industrial things, the spinning things you see, all that stuff.

2126
03:00:51,629 --> 03:00:53,269
[SPEAKER_12]: You know what would also be awesome to do with that?

2127
03:00:53,669 --> 03:00:56,550
[SPEAKER_12]: To make your own Beatmania skin for Stepmania.

2128
03:00:58,303 --> 03:00:59,123
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm not doing it.

2129
03:00:59,684 --> 03:01:00,704
[SPEAKER_14]: I ain't putting that effort in.

2130
03:01:00,844 --> 03:01:07,826
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's why you see it in there, because they didn't realize that those were not game screenshots, but it's just concept art.

2131
03:01:08,946 --> 03:01:14,028
[SPEAKER_14]: If you want to make a Beatmania-themed webpage, seriously, that's exactly what it's for.

2132
03:01:14,468 --> 03:01:15,428
[SPEAKER_14]: At least my impression.

2133
03:01:15,488 --> 03:01:16,269
[SPEAKER_14]: So that's kind of cool.

2134
03:01:16,429 --> 03:01:20,270
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I'm really sad that none of the trailer video is on there.

2135
03:01:20,711 --> 03:01:22,152
[SPEAKER_12]: Jam with the Band for the Nintendo DS

2136
03:01:46,348 --> 03:01:47,490
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it anywhere.

2137
03:01:48,211 --> 03:01:48,411
[SPEAKER_14]: Nope.

2138
03:01:48,771 --> 03:01:49,272
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it.

2139
03:01:50,453 --> 03:01:51,234
[SPEAKER_14]: I didn't see it either.

2140
03:01:51,335 --> 03:01:52,256
[SPEAKER_14]: I guess I didn't show it.

2141
03:01:52,736 --> 03:01:55,400
[SPEAKER_14]: Unless I somehow completely missed it, which is possible.

2142
03:01:55,480 --> 03:01:57,523
[SPEAKER_12]: We did play a music game on Gizmondo.

2143
03:01:58,063 --> 03:01:59,906
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, what was that Gizmondo music game you played real quick?

2144
03:01:59,926 --> 03:02:00,366
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't remember.

2145
03:02:00,667 --> 03:02:01,548
[SPEAKER_12]: It was some guitar game.

2146
03:02:01,949 --> 03:02:02,529
[SPEAKER_12]: It was kind of weird.

2147
03:02:02,569 --> 03:02:03,771
[SPEAKER_12]: It was like a guitar game.

2148
03:02:04,509 --> 03:02:11,659
[SPEAKER_12]: Sort of like, I don't even know how to compare it, but it's very, it's like a rhythm music game with action game mixed in it.

2149
03:02:11,899 --> 03:02:12,420
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of weird.

2150
03:02:12,460 --> 03:02:14,102
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura actually played it a little more.

2151
03:02:14,162 --> 03:02:15,564
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe she can fill you in on it next week.

2152
03:02:15,604 --> 03:02:16,184
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget to ask.

2153
03:02:16,585 --> 03:02:17,766
[SPEAKER_14]: Last, last one real quick.

2154
03:02:17,847 --> 03:02:21,191
[SPEAKER_14]: Doobs wants to know, if you didn't talk about this already, what happened with the Katamari?

2155
03:02:21,770 --> 03:02:22,151
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know.

2156
03:02:22,191 --> 03:02:23,372
[SPEAKER_14]: We imagine they rolled it out the door.

2157
03:02:23,472 --> 03:02:25,794
[SPEAKER_14]: It's probably sitting in Namco's big office somewhere.

2158
03:02:26,094 --> 03:02:26,955
[SPEAKER_14]: They probably think it's funny.

2159
03:02:27,235 --> 03:02:28,196
[SPEAKER_14]: But our media sampler's on it.

2160
03:02:28,216 --> 03:02:30,938
[SPEAKER_12]: Our media sampler's on there, and then a few inches away, the ferret.

2161
03:02:31,058 --> 03:02:32,440
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, so, kind of funny.

2162
03:02:34,361 --> 03:02:36,303
[SPEAKER_12]: Which will have pictures of that online soon, hopefully.

2163
03:02:36,383 --> 03:02:36,984
[SPEAKER_14]: It'll be interesting.

2164
03:02:37,244 --> 03:02:38,925
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd be curious to know what they are going to do with that.

2165
03:02:38,945 --> 03:02:42,088
[SPEAKER_12]: Oh, I did check out my camera and the pictures that it took, and they all suck.

2166
03:02:44,250 --> 03:02:47,653
[SPEAKER_12]: So, not much in pretty much everything that we have.

2167
03:02:48,055 --> 03:02:52,982
[SPEAKER_12]: That I took a picture of, we have a better copy in the press kit.

2168
03:02:53,643 --> 03:02:56,688
[SPEAKER_14]: Jamie said something that she took something like 600 pictures.

2169
03:02:56,788 --> 03:02:57,869
[SPEAKER_14]: It's insane.

2170
03:02:57,909 --> 03:02:59,311
[SPEAKER_14]: I took like 70 or 80 at most.

2171
03:02:59,332 --> 03:03:00,153
[SPEAKER_14]: She took like 600.

2172
03:03:03,157 --> 03:03:03,898
[SPEAKER_12]: I took 117, I deleted most of them.

2173
03:03:27,618 --> 03:03:29,700
[SPEAKER_14]: The only thing I know how to say is, what are you doing this weekend?

2174
03:03:29,720 --> 03:03:31,481
[SPEAKER_14]: And I'm sure that's useful in some sense, but... All right.

2175
03:03:54,153 --> 03:03:54,553
[SPEAKER_14]: That's it.

2176
03:03:54,593 --> 03:03:55,754
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got to wrap up the show, you guys.

2177
03:03:56,414 --> 03:03:58,656
[SPEAKER_14]: Some folks in the chat room are asking about the sex game.

2178
03:03:58,676 --> 03:03:59,956
[SPEAKER_14]: They want to hear your story with the sex game.

2179
03:03:59,976 --> 03:04:02,918
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm going to have to tell you guys to go to the podcast because it's all in the podcast.

2180
03:04:03,639 --> 03:04:05,060
[SPEAKER_14]: Thursday and Friday's edition.

2181
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:10,423
[SPEAKER_12]: Their website, unfortunately, does not have anything about the game or at least it's all in Korean and I couldn't figure it out.

2182
03:04:12,825 --> 03:04:16,227
[SPEAKER_12]: I will purchase the game because I actually told Nellie about it and she wanted to play it.

2183
03:04:17,088 --> 03:04:19,069
[SPEAKER_12]: Even after I told her about the peripherals.

2184
03:04:19,429 --> 03:04:19,749
[SPEAKER_12]: I don't know.

2185
03:04:19,769 --> 03:04:20,870
[SPEAKER_12]: That's going to be interesting.

2186
03:04:22,458 --> 03:04:24,819
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, we are out of here, you guys.

2187
03:04:25,239 --> 03:04:26,119
[SPEAKER_14]: Final thought, Loki.

2188
03:04:28,000 --> 03:04:29,100
[SPEAKER_12]: I drank too much water.

2189
03:04:30,341 --> 03:04:38,384
[SPEAKER_14]: And my final thought is I'm hungry, and I feel like one of those McDonald's fruit and walnut salads for some weird-ass reason.

2190
03:04:39,064 --> 03:04:40,385
[SPEAKER_14]: Ice cream would be really good, too, though.

2191
03:04:40,805 --> 03:04:41,945
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to eat yogurt.

2192
03:04:42,185 --> 03:04:44,226
[SPEAKER_12]: I got this thing of yogurt, and it's getting old.

2193
03:04:44,793 --> 03:04:46,114
[SPEAKER_14]: Final word of the show.

2194
03:04:47,014 --> 03:04:47,714
[SPEAKER_14]: Good night, everybody.

2195
03:04:47,814 --> 03:04:50,915
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a good one, and we'll see you next week with more Orange Lounge.

2196
03:04:50,935 --> 03:04:51,836
[SPEAKER_14]: DarkSakura will be back.

2197
03:04:51,876 --> 03:04:53,476
[SPEAKER_14]: We hope to have guests in the studio as well.

2198
03:04:53,836 --> 03:04:56,377
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't forget to check out our podcast and other live shows.

2199
03:04:56,897 --> 03:04:59,158
[SPEAKER_14]: There will be a surprise live show this week as well.

2200
03:04:59,458 --> 03:05:00,419
[SPEAKER_14]: That's all I'm going to say.

2201
03:05:01,499 --> 03:05:01,879
[SPEAKER_14]: Tune in.

2202
03:05:01,939 --> 03:05:04,220
[SPEAKER_14]: Maybe our live general community will have more information on that.

2203
03:05:04,260 --> 03:05:04,660
[SPEAKER_14]: We'll see.

2204
03:05:05,020 --> 03:05:11,683
[SPEAKER_14]: And tonight's fortune cookie, DarkSakura didn't send me a new one just yet, so you get a classic fortune cookie from our archives that I love.

2205
03:05:11,983 --> 03:05:13,263
[SPEAKER_14]: Final word of the show, Loki.

2206
03:05:13,704 --> 03:05:14,624
[SPEAKER_14]: One word that sums it all up.

2207
03:05:15,267 --> 03:05:15,847
[SPEAKER_12]: Beatmania

2208
03:05:42,782 --> 03:05:48,023
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sensimia Street?

2209
03:05:48,423 --> 03:05:51,504
[SPEAKER_08]: How to get to Sensimia Street?

2210
03:05:51,744 --> 03:05:55,885
[SPEAKER_08]: How to get to Sensimia Street?

2211
03:05:55,985 --> 03:06:01,286
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, Kermit the Frog here, and welcome to Sensimia Street.

2212
03:06:02,427 --> 03:06:08,128
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.

2213
03:06:09,741 --> 03:06:12,302
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?

2214
03:06:12,743 --> 03:06:14,143
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure, Kermit.

2215
03:06:14,563 --> 03:06:19,125
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's letter is... Joint.

2216
03:06:20,706 --> 03:06:24,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.

2217
03:06:26,668 --> 03:06:27,409
[SPEAKER_05]: It is a word.

2218
03:06:28,249 --> 03:06:29,230
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, kids.

2219
03:06:29,850 --> 03:06:32,871
[SPEAKER_05]: Today's letter is three.

2220
03:06:33,071 --> 03:06:34,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Hmm, Big Bird, uh...

2221
03:06:36,095 --> 03:06:37,436
[SPEAKER_05]: Three is a number.

2222
03:06:38,437 --> 03:06:39,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

2223
03:06:39,958 --> 03:06:44,482
[SPEAKER_05]: The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.

2224
03:06:46,964 --> 03:06:49,506
[SPEAKER_05]: Kermit, are you with me?

2225
03:06:51,768 --> 03:06:52,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God I'm stoned.

2226
03:06:53,903 --> 03:06:55,164
[SPEAKER_05]: Me too.

2227
03:06:56,364 --> 03:07:00,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Guys, guys, show go on.

2228
03:07:00,746 --> 03:07:02,066
[SPEAKER_08]: Come on.

2229
03:07:02,347 --> 03:07:03,967
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Elmo.

2230
03:07:04,768 --> 03:07:07,649
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?

2231
03:07:08,589 --> 03:07:09,730
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

2232
03:07:10,990 --> 03:07:16,792
[SPEAKER_05]: A, B, C, D, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, S, F,

2233
03:07:24,881 --> 03:07:27,463
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot what we were doing, Kramit.

2234
03:07:28,844 --> 03:07:30,766
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you just call me Kramit?

2235
03:07:31,246 --> 03:07:32,367
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, I did.

2236
03:07:33,428 --> 03:07:34,749
[SPEAKER_05]: Kramity Frog here.

2237
03:07:35,610 --> 03:07:39,633
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, okay.

2238
03:07:40,454 --> 03:07:42,515
