1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:27,920
Turn around, look at what you see

2
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:35,920
In the face, the mirror of your dreams

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,920
We are not here, hidden in the light

4
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,920
Lifting on the pages

5
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:53,920
With the answer to our never ending story

6
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
To fall behind the clouds

7
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,920
And then another rainbow

8
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,920
Is the answer to our never ending story

9
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Story

10
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:38,920
Shine my bear, for she may fade away And I'm your hand, the brother when you die

11
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,920
Why won't you keep the secret?

12
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,920
We'll fall behind the clouds

13
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,920
Then along the rainbow

14
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,920
Is the answer to another end

15
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:38,420
Ooh, ooh, ooh Ooh, ooh, ooh

16
00:03:53,920 --> 00:04:15,840

18
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:28,340
gosh it was a hell of a show of course lots of people there you had to push

19
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,820
your way through crowds and stomp all over people to get to things you had to

20
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:36,580
wait three freaking hours the line if you want to play Zelda and unfortunately

21
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:42,180
not all the cast members made it out alive yes unfortunately not all of us

22
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:47,580
made it out of e3 alive no we'll have more details on all of that when we come

23
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,980
back but I'll tell you what tonight it is all about the music games at e3 and

24
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:58,980
So it was a hell of a show, surprises that just blew the roof off and smacked you up.

25
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,980
We'll talk more about that when we start the show after these opening credits.

26
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:04,980
We'll be back.

27
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:11,980

Call me daddy.

30
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:13,700

31
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:20,700
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity. Orange Lounge may contain plenty of...

32
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
B-b-b-cocky.

33
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,700
Just kidding. Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.

34
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,700
Isn't that special?

35
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:45,700

38
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:07,700
You're tuned into Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want.

00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:13,700

00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:22,700
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

42
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:27,700
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as Sky. Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts.

43
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:32,700
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm is Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura.

44
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:37,700
No, I'm kidding. She's actually not here tonight. She died at E3. It's so sad.

45
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:42,700
No, I'm kidding. She didn't die at E3.

46
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:47,700
She just, she, she extended her vacation a little bit.

47
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:56,700
You see, some of us went to E3 a couple days before it started, and some of us decided to stay a couple days after it was over.

48
00:07:56,700 --> 00:08:02,700
So, Jamie is on her way back this afternoon, or I'm sorry, this evening actually from LA, so she's not here.

49
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:05,700
But who is here is the one and only Loki!

50
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I am here and I have pizza. That's always good.

51
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,700
I did slash pizza and I got my Pizza Hut.

52
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:16,700
by slash pizza means I drove my car over to the Taco Bell slash Pizza Hut

53
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:17,300
Express

54
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:20,400
and got myself pizza the old-fashioned way

55
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,080
not the EverQuest way hell no I'm not gonna

56
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,940
sign up for EverQuest just to get that lazy besides there's no Pizza Hut near my house

57
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,740
that makes me sad

58
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:32,340
you know speaking of EverQuest this is completely off subject but

59
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:35,720
we actually I actually got to meet some of our quote unquote

60
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:39,500
competitors although not really because you know all of us online radio stations are

61
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,740
people in the same industry. Yeah, people in the same industry. I met the folks from

62
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:50,220
MMO Radio who talk about nothing but EverQuest and, uh, what are the other, I don't even

63
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:57,080
know, World of Warcraft and Guild Wars and all those types of games 24-7, so. If you

64
00:08:57,080 --> 00:09:01,260
think it's weird that there's stations out there dedicated to DDR, just know that there's

65
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:06,800
other stations out there dedicated to other types of games. Anyway, we got a fun show

66
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,120
for you guys tonight. It's just me and Loki. We actually don't have any other guests tonight.

67
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,040
I know Rice Princess is actually here around. She's watching movies with my roommate, though,

68
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:18,600
so I don't know if we'll be able to get her on, but maybe we'll get her...

69
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,600
She's watching Fargo.

70
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,840
Are they watching Fargo? Why? Why are they watching Fargo, of all things?

71
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:27,360
I guess they want to, I don't know, watch someone get thrown through a wood chipper.

72
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,040
How about watching a movie that wasn't really overrated? That sounds like fun.

73
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:08,000
new song to play for you guys from EX2 and we have a bootleg copy of a song

74
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,200
from Ultra Big Street this is too cool I can't wait to hear how this turns out

75
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:14,680
we'll be back with more details on that after this started off with a little bit

76
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:21,680
your rain will be back

77
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:51,680
I cry out of my head

78
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:57,680
And I don't know what I found

79
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Over and over, I feel it break me down

80
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:18,680
Waiting for a gentle way, a gentle way, a gentle way

81
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:23,680
On the sidewalk, on the city, on my streets just a whisper

82
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:28,680
Busy people, going nowhere, they've been soaking the rain

83
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,680
No compassion, nothing matters, my resistance is waning

84
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:42,680
Like a flower in a basement waiting for our love, yeah

85
00:11:42,680 --> 00:12:09,480
Look at this summer baby, that's my philosophy It's all rubberneck and fancy, but that's

86
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:18,480
Some people say I'm wasting time, but they don't really know

87
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:23,480
Like what I see, see what I've got to give me

88
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Such a tall head, head, head

89
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:31,480
Sitting on the back porch, all by myself

90
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:39,480
Oh, King Mary Jane, I'm with somebody else, baby

91
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,480
Stop, look and listen, baby

92
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,480
That's my philosophy

93
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:49,480
It's called rubbernecking, baby

94
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,480
That's alright with me, yeah

95
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Hey, hey, hey, baby

96
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,480
That's alright with me, yeah

97
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:58,480
We're going downtown, oh yeah We're going downtown, oh yeah

98
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:13,400
Don't, don't, don't don't stop the beat Can't, can't, can't control my feet

99
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:17,400
P-P-P-People in the street Come on everybody move your feet

100
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:21,320
Don't stop, don't stop the beat I can't stop, can't stop the beat

101
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,520
I won't stop, won't stop the beat no

102
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,520
Let's go!

103
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:30,520
You were right to make me free

104
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:38,520
That you're the need to live

105
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:44,520
You were right to make me free

106
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:52,520
Never thought you'd come to me

107
00:16:52,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Gaming Radio, so uncensored, that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

108
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Moo-caw-key.

109
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Orange Lounge Radio.

110
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:06,520
Pack's done.

111
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:15,520
Hello everybody, we are back on Orange Lounge Radio, and that break, arguably one of the best remixes ever done for DDR, Midihead, in my eyes.

112
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,160
in my eyes. Before that, Junior Senior, Move Your Feet,

113
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:23,920
Elvis, Rubberneckin from Ultramix 2, and the Kiryamaoka with Your Rain, The Rage Mix

114
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,400
from

115
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:29,680
DDR Extreme USA. Remember when it was like a really huge deal because we were

116
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,640
like the first

117
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:35,280
place that had that song and we played it and like we made everybody wait for

118
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,720
like two and a half hours before we finally played the song.

119
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,400
Which one? The Your Rain, The Rage Mix. Oh yeah. We're hoping we get to do that again this year.

120
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,520
We're actually kind of excited because we think we might have some hookups this year

121
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:50,480
where we'll get to debut some of the new songs for you guys, so we're very excited about

122
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
that.

123
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Yay.

124
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:56,480
So, anyway, yes we have a lot of E3 to talk about tonight.

125
00:17:56,480 --> 00:18:00,720
Just Loki and I here tonight, DarkSakura has the night off, she's on her way back from

126
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:01,720
L.A. right now.

127
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:06,840
Her and some folks from DRFreak went over to Disneyland yesterday, and I was actually

128
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:11,040
originally going to go with them, but I had to back out at the last minute, basically,

129
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:15,760
Because I'm in a bit of a financial situation right now so I couldn't afford to go to Disneyland

130
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,200
among some other things going on.

131
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,200
You're better off.

132
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,440
I mean, it's overrated.

133
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,040
Well, I have some good memories from when I was a kid.

134
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,800
So I was like, eh, I kind of want to go to Disneyland.

135
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,000
It'd be cute.

136
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,360
And plus it made my mom really jealous because I told my mom I was going to go to Disneyland.

137
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,360
She was like, I want to go.

138
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,640
What are you going to do?

139
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:36,520
So I was going to have fun being able to rub that in her face, but I didn't end up going.

140
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,840
So that's all right.

141
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,840
It happens.

142
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:42,380
had a pretty good time at E3, so I guess that's that.

143
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:45,140
All right, so how about a little bit of how was your

144
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,700
week, how was your day, except for the fact that we're going

145
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,300
to talk about E3 a little later.

146
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,140
So is there anything you want to share outside of E3 for how

147
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,460
was your week, how was your day, low key?

148
00:18:54,460 --> 00:18:58,220
Well, let's start off with, first off, we

149
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:58,980
drove down there.

150
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,220
That was eight hours of fun.

151
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:07,860
And then we got there, and we went and saw the More Friends

152
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,460
concert, and, well...

153
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,220
Yeah, more friends, more music from Final Fantasy.

154
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,460
It was Snap, Crackle, and Poppin' Fun.

155
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,020
That's what it was.

156
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:21,460
I think that's the best way to describe the concert, was Snap, Crackle, Pop.

157
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:22,460
That's a good one.

158
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:23,460
Let's just put it this way, okay?

159
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:30,060
If you were to have, like, say, they had complete retards working their audio.

160
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,060
That's what it was.

161
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:34,820
Because, you know, the singers would be singing, you can't hear them, or the mics wouldn't

162
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:35,820
be turned on.

163
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:39,780
It's like they honestly like they got some tech guy out of high school to do it

164
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,940
You know, it was awful as far as audio goes. It was cool

165
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:47,860
You know the black mages were cool and everything

166
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,700
But it just wasn't mixed right and it's just it didn't sound good at all

167
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:59,180
Like it's especially the end where they like combined the rock band with the orchestra with the choir. It's just drowned out everything

168
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,180
It's just awful

169
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:03,760
In that sense, but it was a cool concert

170
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:20,760
And then we went to Arcade Infinity, and I played the tambourine game except it sucked, only because they didn't have the thing on the floor, told you where to stand, so I couldn't tell where the sensors were, so I, you know, kept losing. But I got to play Night of Fire on tambourines, and I looked like a complete dumbass.

171
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,760
Is it just me, or is the tambourine game the gayest game ever made? And I can say that because I am gay.

172
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:31,840
because I am gay it's exactly like some of the amigo it's just but I mean don't

173
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:37,880
you look a little bit fruity playing that game I guess I can trust me I

174
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,840
looked over you look pretty fruity playing that game I guess I hey okay I

175
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:46,040
had played dance maniacs all day I had to get my dance maniacs Phil and after

176
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:50,360
my hands started hurting from hitting the damn sensors on accident I decided

177
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:53,400
to just go ahead and play the tambourine game since it was there you know try it

178
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,720
out and no it wasn't good it sucked and this is arcade infinity of course that

179
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,780
has this game and you know a lot of people know arcade infinity because it's

180
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:08,460
like you know the home of all these import games and it's the babani capital

181
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,980
of the world and stuff is it just me or is arcade infinity slowly losing its

182
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:17,140
charm a little bit as the years go yeah it's slowly losing its charm I did get

183
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:21,240
to play some guitar freaks V that was kind of cool and I got to play who was

184
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:29,240
What was that one song? Well, Misery Lou had played that, and then whatever that heavy metal song that was in that.

185
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:35,240
The only one I remember I actually really like, I hate to admit this, I really like the Vanilla Ninja song that's in Guitar Freaks. I need to copy it.

186
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:43,240
I played that too. But anyways, the heavy metal one that was completely obnoxious, I played that about three times. Really loud.

187
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:48,240
because the guitar freaks there, it's really loud. It's just extremely loud.

188
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:53,240
It's so unexpected, coming from playing at Golf Land where everything's quiet.

189
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:59,240
I got to play a little bit of Papa Music Yoha when I was there, and it pissed me off

190
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:02,240
because when I started the game I just went into, you know, I can't read Japanese,

191
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,240
I don't know what the different modes are, so I just went into the first mode,

192
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:09,240
the default mode, and it's some type of beginner warm-up mode, so I couldn't pick

193
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,320
pick from hardly any of the songs so I got kind of frustrated I mean I got to

194
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:17,280
play Gradius full speed in the first game but it was on like easy mode and

195
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,240
you know I'm already decent enough at pop music where I can play a lot of

196
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,800
stuff on hyper so finally I figured out the only way you can really pick from

197
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:27,080
any song is you have to go into challenge mode but that just kind of

198
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:30,200
ticked me off that I lost a dollar because I didn't know better I also

199
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,920
played a game of 2d x-red did you play any 2d x-red nope don't play 2d oh well

200
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:39,040
I it was fun I guess I was able to play injection of love and that made me happy

201
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:48,300
happy. What else did I play? Nothing, really. They had taken out my GalsPentate game from

202
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:55,220
AI, so that made me sad. Yeah, really, that was all I played, was dance maniacs and guitar

203
00:22:55,220 --> 00:23:01,440
freaks there. I don't care to touch Poppy Music, just because... I mean, honestly, why

204
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:07,620
are they making Poppy Music 13? It's the same fucking game all over. It's just, oh, look,

205
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,380
changed it now it's a different theme it's got a game it's got a rabid fan

206
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:16,400
base and apparently it's still doing very well in Japan so I don't get it

207
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:22,260
don't know what to tell you I don't get it but yeah so I played that as fun and

208
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:25,900
then you know of course you know Wednesday Thursday Friday and we

209
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:31,740
actually did the e3 thing a little bit of highlights though of non e3 stuff we

210
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,500
did fight it okay now get this we fought our way through an audio slave concert

211
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:43,500
to go to Hooters. Yes, this is true. We fought our way through a concert in the middle of

212
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:49,840
Hollywood in Highland to go to Hooters to eat. I guess they were taping the Jimmy Kimmel

213
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:54,840
show or something. All these people were out there because, you know, free Audioslave concert.

214
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,780
And I'm going to be honest, guys, I didn't even know who Audioslave was, really, until

215
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:03,020
I looked up and the guy was singing Spoon Man and I was like, oh, it's the guy from

216
00:24:03,020 --> 00:24:06,860
Soundgarden he must have like a new band and finally I figured it out I mean how's

217
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:12,820
that apparently their new album came out that day okay apparently that's what I

218
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:16,980
read but I get it but yeah so we had to fight our way through a crowd so that we

219
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:20,660
could go to Hooters because they don't have Hooters in Sacramento so it's a big

220
00:24:20,660 --> 00:24:24,460
deal for us to get to go to Hooters it was who terrific yeah and honestly

221
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:29,660
what's the big deal with Hooters why are they have a I know we I don't like to

222
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:32,020
talk about local stuff a lot but they're making a big stink about putting a

223
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:34,500
Hooters here in Sacramento because they're saying you know it's gonna crap

224
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:38,300
the children. What's the big deal? I've seen bigger horror waitresses at Chili's

225
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:42,940
than I saw at Hooters. If you want to talk about a big horror selling burgers, look at

226
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:49,620
the new Paris Hilton Carl's Jr. commercial. Come on. Is that... and oh man I

227
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:53,780
can't believe that she's just like... did you know and I'm not sure if you're

228
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:57,940
aware of this that's actually gonna be on TV and I saw this last night before

229
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:01,140
they're... you know they have the commercials before the movies and stuff

230
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,140
They were trailering get this

231
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:05,660
It was I want to be a Hilton

232
00:25:05,660 --> 00:25:12,620
It's gonna be a new reality show where the mother is actually gonna try to eat like it's refined making them refined

233
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:16,900
I'm like, yeah and like your daughter's really refined refined improper my ass

234
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,460
So, um, yeah, it's gonna be a new reality show coming to TV. That's crap

235
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:28,380
I wish the Hilton's would just disappear honestly all of them your hotels get affected by aliens

236
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:33,980
and their hotels are not that good. Actually, I stayed in the Hilton once. It was nice.

237
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:40,340
But that's because my work paid for it. When I have to pay for it, I stay at Motel 6 in

238
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:48,260
the ghetto part of Hollywood. We didn't have any run-ins with former reality TV stars this

239
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:54,660
time at the Motel 6 like we did last year. All the celebrity sightings this year were

240
00:25:54,660 --> 00:26:00,260
from far away. And a culmination of everybody that was in our group, I think we saw Gary

241
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:08,180
Coleman, Sinbad again. We saw Jason Mewes and the Waynes brothers.

242
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:10,060
At E3, not at our hotel.

243
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:17,300
At E3, yeah right, at our hotel, my ass. Although, our hotel is a step up from Jersey.

244
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:24,020
But that's pretty much all that really happened. It's just not too much exciting stuff, really.

245
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:31,660
of walking, feet tired. We're on G4 TV. Oh yeah. If you guys haven't heard the podcast

246
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:37,420
yet, which by the way, we were doing podcasts every day from E3, and you can download this

247
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:42,400
at www.orangelandradio.com. Click on Orange Island Radio To Go edition. We actually did

248
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:47,700
live broadcasts Wednesday, Thursday, Friday from E3. And I believe it's Thursday's edition

249
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:52,060
we talked about this because it happened on Thursday. We're standing in line to get autographs.

250
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:56,260
Yeah, we're standing in line to get autographs for my dad, okay? It's for my dad.

251
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,360
I, you know, I'm not starstruck or any of that stuff, you know.

252
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,580
It's not a big deal to me, but my dad really loves the

253
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,040
Attack of the Show, because he's loved the screensaver since the beginning, so I thought,

254
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:10,620
okay, that'll be a nice gift. If only this were, like, last year or something and

255
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,680
Leo Laporte hadn't been fired yet, then I'd be starstruck, but

256
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:17,600
maybe me too a little bit, maybe me too a little bit. Because Leo's awesome, Leo.

257
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:24,840
But, anyway, so, yeah, we were waiting in line and they were filming G4TV.com up on

258
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:29,440
their little, like, platform there, because they were doing a lot of filming at E3, and

259
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:34,640
so they're filming an episode of that, and they actually were, you know, filming the

260
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:39,520
line as we were waiting to get in, just for bumpers for the commercials when you come

261
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:45,840
in, you know, they do a little, you know, talking over the picture and whatnot.

262
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:50,840
basically they filmed us for quite a long time on that actually it's funny

263
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:53,600
somebody in the chair room says were you guys in one of the panning shots below

264
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:59,240
the platform thing yes that was it yeah so we're down there and we're in a

265
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,000
couple of them and I hear Brad and Irene are also in one for another show too

266
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:08,760
because they were in the live crowd shot or something at the very end so I

267
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:15,240
don't know but it's interesting I thought it's pretty cool and I slipped

268
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:22,080
them Kevin and Sarah one of our media samplers while I was there as well so

269
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:26,360
we're trying to figure out if like he actually listened to it which we kind of

270
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:29,840
doubt because you know the people probably slip him all sorts of weird

271
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,280
shit and he doesn't you know he didn't care so we're wondering if one of the

272
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:36,760
interns is listening to it or if one of the bums who found it in the trash out

273
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:43,000
back ended up listening to it we don't know I don't know whatever but that yeah

274
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:49,000
Yeah, that was pretty much our E3, I believe. That pretty much sums it up, other than actual E3 stuff.

275
00:28:49,000 --> 00:29:06,000
Yeah. Uh, let's see. What kind of stuff did I do over the week? Pretty much the same thing, because we were pretty much hanging out together all the week, except I haven't had a car the past couple days, which kind of sucks, so I haven't been able to really go anywhere, because my car's getting repaired from the break-in when they stole my stereo a couple weeks ago.

276
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:11,600
Um, funny E3 stories, I don't really have a whole lot to add to that except for me almost

277
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:15,460
passing out because I had to wait for 45 minutes to get a damn hamburger and one of those lines

278
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:21,940
downstairs to, where there's food. Man, E3 is just so freaking crowded and they don't

279
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:26,840
have enough stuff to handle everybody, it seems like. I wonder if they actually put

280
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,460
a limit on how many people can go to that. They obviously don't. It really seems like

281
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
anybody can go.

282
00:29:31,460 --> 00:29:59,460
Pretty much. I mean, Sinbad's in there. I mean, come on, Sinbad? He's not in the industry. Nor is Gary Coleman. Although, I could see maybe that he, you know, would get one of those legacy passes. I don't know if he'd been there. He'd get invites anyways. Gary Coleman, I think, was in a game, like, a couple years ago. It's possible. I don't know. But, I don't know. I think it's just kind of cool to see that they actually have interest in that kind of stuff, though. That's kind of neat.

283
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,960
Where was Elijah Wood? I thought he was this huge gamer because he was on MTV promoting the Xbox 360.

284
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:09,960
Where was he at E3? That's what I want to know.

285
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,460
I have no idea.

286
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:20,960
I guess he had better things to do, more important than gaming stuff because he was such a hardcore gamer.

287
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:25,960
You know, apparently, I don't know if this is just a rumor or what have you,

288
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:29,000
but one of my friends posted in LiveJournal about this,

289
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,840
that the Xbox 360, because you got me thinking about that,

290
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:34,460
that you couldn't really see the consoles

291
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,300
at the Microsoft booth.

292
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,540
You couldn't see the consoles at all.

293
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,760
You just saw them running and you saw the controllers,

294
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,920
but you didn't see the actual console.

295
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,440
Yep, the consoles were there.

296
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,880
But no, he said he looked into one,

297
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
like he looked into one of the cases,

298
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,440
and he saw a frickin' Power Mac G5 in there.

299
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,800
Not an Xbox 360.

300
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:54,840
So isn't that ironic if there's some secret Apple

301
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:59,640
Microsoft teaming up thing. Well, first off, yes, the G5 processors are in there.

302
00:30:59,640 --> 00:31:04,480
Second of all, the test kits look like a G5. And third of all, there were the

303
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:09,240
actual Xbox 360s there. They were just... it was built... Some of them were there.

304
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,500
Pretty much it was like a... looked like this white kind of pedestal thing, and

305
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,880
then there was a little cutout, and the 360 was in that cutout. But that was it.

306
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:23,560
But yeah, they were actually there, and it was probably running off of development

307
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:28,320
kits, which they've had the pictures online for them. They look like G5s. They pretty

308
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:34,800
much are G5s, but it's because it runs off the same chipset, PowerPC stuff, so.

309
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:35,800
Crazy.

310
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,800
Yeah.

311
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,720
Did you actually get to play anything for Xbox 360?

312
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:42,400
No, I watched people play stuff.

313
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,880
I played one game. I played that Top Spin 2, the tennis game.

314
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:52,000
I watched people play, what was it, Knee for Speed, Most Wanted, and that looked pretty

315
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,000
cool.

316
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:59,240
I also, what was it, I was watching demos for different things, but it was just like,

317
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,240
it was cool.

318
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,600
I mean, really good graphics.

319
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:06,280
I did go online, though, and watch the rest of those, pretty much everything that you

320
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:10,640
would have to wait in line for, for the PS3, and that looks pretty cool.

321
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:16,920
like the issue of the new Gran Turismo game mock-up, the re-rendered Final Fantasy 7 intro,

322
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:23,040
the Spider-Man, Doctor Octopus stuff, and just the amount of details on there is pretty

323
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
amazing.

324
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:26,040
That'll be interesting.

325
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:30,720
Okay, so now that's it for How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, because I have nothing really

326
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,520
to add to what Loki adds, so let's talk about the music games.

327
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,760
This is honestly the biggest year for Music Games Z3.

328
00:32:38,760 --> 00:32:39,760
Oh yeah.

329
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:43,880
So, starting off, the big surprise that just blew everybody out of the water, and people

330
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:49,320
were like, OMG, it's finally happening, Beatmania USA.

331
00:32:49,320 --> 00:32:53,280
Now Loki, I know you're not a really big Beatmania fan, but even you must have been impressed

332
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,280
by this news.

333
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:55,280
What did you think?

334
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:59,160
I just thought, ooh, yay, it's Beatmania.

335
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,160
I'm gonna go play DDR now.

336
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:06,040
No, it was just like, I was hoping there'd be some different songs in there other than

337
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,160
just like really old Konami originals.

338
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,820
But you know, it's the test location stuff.

339
00:33:10,820 --> 00:33:15,260
But it did look pretty good for test location, like, you know, the E3 demo version or whatever.

340
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:18,460
It looked pretty polished and stuff.

341
00:33:18,460 --> 00:33:21,860
And honestly, I don't know why people judge that as the final product, because it wasn't...

342
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:27,260
I mean, if anyone remembers UltraMix 2 last year and how much it sucked, oh my God.

343
00:33:27,260 --> 00:33:28,260
But yeah, this...

344
00:33:28,260 --> 00:33:31,260
Yeah, and then UltraMix 2 ends up being one of the best games they ever put out, arguably.

345
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:35,380
Yeah, it's just, it's mid, you know, it's not even finished yet.

346
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:37,020
It's just partial.

347
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,900
So it was pretty good for what it was, you know, um, at least the controllers will be

348
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:43,860
hopefully cheaper to bring in.

349
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:44,860
That's, I'm sure...

350
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,820
Yeah, that's something where everybody wins.

351
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:50,360
Even if you're not a fan of BeatMania in the US and you're against the idea and you're

352
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:54,300
like I don't get the point because I have every Japanese mix anyway, at least you're

353
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,720
gonna win with this because there's gonna be controllers available now in the US.

354
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:02,220
Of course there's still gonna be people who bitch when they won't release the arcade style

355
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,220
controllers here.

356
00:34:03,220 --> 00:34:06,260
And I heard, I heard that they're gonna be redesigned too.

357
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,060
Yeah, you know, the ones that we played at, at E3, they actually have the new Konami logo on them,

358
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:15,160
and I don't remember the controller I have having the new Konami logo on it,

359
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:18,960
but I think it's some type of new pressing of the Japanese controllers,

360
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,960
because they still said on the turntable itself,

361
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,660
I actually have a picture of them that I'm going to be putting in the Orange Launch Radio galleries in the next couple days,

362
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:31,060
it actually says BeatMania 2DX on the little turntable,

363
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,960
so that makes me, because of the fact that they're not calling it 2DX here,

364
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:36,720
because there hasn't been a BeatMania 1 technically.

365
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:40,600
I mean, granted, we had Hip Hop Mania a year ago, but I think they're just overlooking

366
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:41,600
that.

367
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,420
And also because, you know, obviously, the new modes, it doesn't really need to be 2DX,

368
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:51,120
because it's kind of BeatMania and 2DX in 1, so, I mean, you don't really need to call

369
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:52,940
it that, so.

370
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,120
But it looked pretty cool.

371
00:34:56,120 --> 00:35:01,400
As far as, you know, I didn't actually play it, because 1, it's just, you know, there's

372
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,400
a line of people playing it, and two, I'm just not even good at Beatmania, so I said

373
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:09,820
no, I'm not gonna touch this, but it looked cool.

374
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,800
It was interesting though, because they were actually plugging Beatmania, if you watch

375
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,100
the little trailer, because Konami at their booth, they show trailers for all the games

376
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:19,540
that are coming out, so you know, you'd have the DDR trailer, and the Beatmania, and the

377
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:23,980
Castlevania, and the We Are The Winx, We Are The Winx, that trailer as well, those are

378
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:24,980
all playing.

379
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:29,020
What's interesting about the Beatmania trailer, is that it actually said, bringing the arcade

380
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:30,540
experience home.

381
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:34,380
There were USA cabinets, though. But not for 2DX. There was, remember, Hip-Hop Mania.

382
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:38,020
Right, there was Hip-Hop Mania, which I thought was kind of weird, because, okay, A, the game

383
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:42,060
is not being called Hip-Hop Mania, and let me be the first to say, thank God they aren't

384
00:35:42,060 --> 00:35:45,940
calling it Hip-Hop Mania, because I, for one, would have been really disappointed if they

385
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,440
did. Well, they can't call it Hip-Hop Mania just

386
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,980
because it would confuse people. How about the fact that there was no hip-hop

387
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:56,820
songs in the demo, really? Maybe one. That's a stretch. But most of it's trance and, you

388
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:00,960
you know, they can't really call it hip hop mania. But it's interesting that they said

389
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,560
in the draft, bringing the arcade experience home, or, you know, bringing the arcade hit

390
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:08,040
home. Even the announcer guy was saying, hey, it's an arcade hit, and they're bringing it

391
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,040
home.

392
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:12,200
I heard a rumor, and of course this is just a rumor, and I think it's another fake song

393
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:18,340
that's floating around the internet, that there was a song that's going to be in Happy

394
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:23,800
Sky that's going to be in the US one also. And it's a DJ Amuro track.

395
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:30,720
Yeah, but I listen to the mp3 of it or what it was supposedly and it no it's a fan

396
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,840
It's not even a good fan made one

397
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:38,760
It was just you know it has piano in it, so I guess that makes it a DJ Murrow track or whatever I can lame

398
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:39,920
but um

399
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:44,920
I'm sure they'll do stuff like that because obviously they haven't listened any licensed stuff

400
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:47,160
And you never know there might be licensed stuff in there

401
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,040
Possibly it's gonna be a little weird for them to get licensed songs in there because the fact that you know an artist is gonna

402
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:57,840
to have to give up key samples and all this stuff, but it worked in amplitude, so there's

403
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,080
no reason it can't happen because amplitude isn't good stuff.

404
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,480
It worked in amplitude, and I'll see after the figure.

405
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,520
The other thing is they've got a good relationship with a different drum.

406
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:08,920
I know a few artists on there that probably wouldn't mind doing that.

407
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:12,440
I would love to see some different drum artists turn up on BeatMeAniI.

408
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,800
Well hey, already you've got ToeJam.

409
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:16,520
How much you want to bet ToeJam is in the US one?

410
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,440
Because they'll be an easy transplant for you.

411
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,120
It's going to be in a brand new mix, Happy Sky, and you know, it was in already Ultra

412
00:37:23,120 --> 00:37:24,120
Mix 2.

413
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:26,160
That would be a pretty easy sell, I would think.

414
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,520
Oh, we'll see.

415
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:32,440
Anyway, you guys, actually on our website, www.orangelandsradio.com, I actually posted

416
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:37,280
up an E3 preview of BeatMania USA, and there's actually screenshots from the actual game

417
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:41,640
and everything, so you can check that out, and as part of it, it actually has the song

418
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,640
list.

419
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,640
If you guys want to check out the songs that are going to show up, these were the songs

420
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,580
that were in the demo, but you know, granted that if they're in the demo they're probably

421
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:54,360
going to end up in the full game, 99% certainty. The seven key songs you're going to see in

422
00:37:54,360 --> 00:38:01,380
BeatMania USA, Dancing into the Night, Nothing Ain't Stoppin', I Was the One, Shining Polaris

423
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:07,240
and In My Eyes. Now, a lot of people were complaining at E3 because the difficulty level

424
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:13,080
was very easy. In My Eyes was showing up as a flashing seven, but the note patterns were

425
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:18,220
something you would see in a beginner note chart. I guarantee you guys this is not the

426
00:38:18,220 --> 00:38:22,120
way the final release is going to be. I guarantee it. It's not going to be like this. You're

427
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:25,160
going to see the same level of difficulty you see in the Japanese mixes. The reason

428
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:30,680
why, now this part I'm speculating, the reason why it was done this way, I speculate, is

429
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:40,380
because you've got people that have never seen this game before at E3. 99% of the people

430
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:44,740
in attendance at E3 probably never saw this game before. Probably only 1% of the people

431
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:49,140
in attendance did. So I think it was something probably to make the game very easily accessible

432
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:54,620
to them. So I don't think people should get too worked up over the fact that the note

433
00:38:54,620 --> 00:39:00,640
patterns were easy. If you look at the screenshots we posted on OrangeLaunchRadio.com, you can

434
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:07,220
actually see the very first screenshot has a more dense note pattern than anything that

435
00:39:07,220 --> 00:39:11,840
was in the demo now granted it's in light 7 mode but still it's a more me

436
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:16,120
all the songs on e3 appeared to be a beginner mode so even to have my light

437
00:39:16,120 --> 00:39:19,800
seven no charts in there I think shows you that there's more to come this is a

438
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:24,400
very very early build just to kind of show off the game I wouldn't take

439
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:30,040
anything in this too much as gospel you know what I mean exactly so so stop

440
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:36,500
getting worked up over the fact that you know it's it was an easy mode um let's

441
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:43,140
Let's see, also if you put the game, now this is where we get something really interesting

442
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:48,580
and really different from the Japanese releases and I think honestly this is a throw to the

443
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,580
fans.

444
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,280
I don't think this is something they had to do, I think this is something that they did

445
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:57,620
for the fans is they actually put in five key mode typically in Japan, for those of

446
00:39:57,620 --> 00:40:02,580
you guys that haven't played these games before, in five key mode it's the seven key songs

447
00:40:02,580 --> 00:40:07,700
But they just put the 6th and 7th key on autoplay, so you only have 5 keys.

448
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,140
And the reason why there is a 5 key mode is because the original Beatmania only had a

449
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,140
5 key mode.

450
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,580
It was a 5 key design.

451
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:18,740
So what they've done for the US release is they're actually putting, when you go into

452
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:23,420
5 key mode, instead of having 6 and 7 just be autoplay and it's the same list of songs,

453
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,540
no no.

454
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:32,160
You're actually gonna get a completely different list of 5 key songs from the 5 key games.

455
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:37,880
So it's kind of a way for us to catch up on what we missed on Japanese 5 key releases.

456
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:41,320
So really in reality you're getting two games in one.

457
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Kinda.

458
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,440
You see what I mean?

459
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:51,960
The five key songs that are going to be available in the demo anyway, La Bossa Nova de February,

460
00:40:51,960 --> 00:41:00,440
Overblast, Hunting for You, Metal Gear Solid Main Theme, and Paranoia Max Dirty Mix.

461
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:05,120
I'm sure they'll have it where you can download or not download, but they'll have more note charts

462
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:11,440
I'm sure they'll open up in seven key and stuff. So eventually probably everything will be played all over, you know

463
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:13,600
May have different note charts for you know

464
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,120
Seven and five or something like that

465
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,720
So it'll be interesting. Yeah, so

466
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:21,940
I'm very excited about this now again

467
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:26,520
This is a very early build that we saw at e3 the actual release of this game is not coming until

468
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:32,200
until 2006. So, we do have a little ways to wait. A lot can happen between now and then

469
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:36,840
as well. From what I'm hearing though, it's going to be early 2006, like first quarter,

470
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:40,920
but you never know what might happen with these games. It could be first or second,

471
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:44,880
but I would say you're definitely going to see this game first half of next year coming

472
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,200
out. So, it should be exciting. Now, one thing that it's kind of getting slammed for is that

473
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:53,760
the early press release on it and the one sheet that was sent to the press about the

474
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:57,440
the game states that there's going to be 50 songs in the mix.

475
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,840
And people are saying, well, if there's different song lists

476
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:04,320
for 5-key and 7-key, that means there's going to be 25 songs

477
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
in 5-key and 7-key.

478
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,400
That's kind of eh.

479
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:10,200
And I have to admit, if it's only going to be 25 songs in

480
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,920
7-key mode, that's a little bit eh.

481
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:15,180
So I'm hoping that maybe, now nobody said it's going to be

482
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:16,200
split right down the middle.

483
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,040
I think one thing that could be interesting is perhaps

484
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:21,560
there's only 10 songs in 5-key mode, 40 in 7-key mode.

485
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:24,060
I think that's something that's kind of feasible.

486
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:24,940
We'll see what happens.

487
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,260
And I think that might be a little more satisfying.

488
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,160
And also, I mean, it doesn't mean that they're going to be

489
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:29,100
stuck in those modes.

490
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:33,260
Like I said, it's not going to take that much effort to make

491
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:37,340
another note chart for one song that was a five key to

492
00:42:37,340 --> 00:42:37,820
seven key.

493
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:39,060
I mean, it's not that hard.

494
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,860
It's just a little editing.

495
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:43,940
So I don't see why that would be a problem.

496
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,860
So anyway, it'll be interesting to see what kind of

497
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,300
songs we get in this game as well.

498
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:56,300
Obviously the interface is night-style's interface, but we're seeing songs that date, you know, all the way back to early, early mixes.

499
00:42:56,300 --> 00:43:02,300
Shining Polaris is, what, fifth-style? It was on fourth-style consumer. It was a fourth-style consumer track.

500
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:05,300
So that goes a little ways back, but then you have...

501
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:06,300
Dirty Mix.

502
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:10,300
In My Eyes was a little bit, what, fifth-style? I'm having a hard time remembering some of this stuff.

503
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,300
Fourth, I think.

504
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:12,300
Yeah, oof.

505
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:19,300
So, we should expect to see songs from a wide variety of the different Konami styles.

506
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:23,880
What would be very cool though, and I hope they do and I don't know if they're gonna end up doing this or not

507
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,100
But I'm hoping in five key mode we get at least one or two songs

508
00:43:28,580 --> 00:43:35,280
From seventh mix or the final because those mixes were never released in Japan. So if we got some of those songs

509
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:41,220
That would be very cool. It'd be kind of like a that would be a really nice thing for Konami to do for the US

510
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:46,980
Audience I think would be to give us like at least one or two songs from seventh mix or the final to show that they care

511
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:53,460
But we'll see. Let's see what happens. All right. So that's about that on BeatMania

512
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:59,060
USA. Anything else you want to add on that? No. Okay. So we will take your calls later

513
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:04,860
over the Skype line if you guys want to talk about BeatMania USA. Pretty nice surprise

514
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:10,060
though, huh? That was a nice surprise. Let's talk about some of the stuff that was actually

515
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:16,300
going on at Konami's booth. It wasn't just a bunch of games being, let me take that back.

516
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:21,860
You have the games being shown, right? You had Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2 and Beatmania.

517
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:25,780
What some of you folks may not realize is that these games, I'm sorry, Karaoke Revolution

518
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:32,600
Party as well, these games were the center stage at Konami's booth. They were the featured

519
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:39,400
games by Konami this year. Yeah. Not only that, they had this huge setup with this light-up

520
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:44,580
wall and this, they called it Club Revolution and these, these were the centerpiece games

521
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,020
that Konami was featuring this year.

522
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,420
Not only were they featuring the games live on center stage,

523
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:50,500
they actually hired, this is something a lot of people

524
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,660
haven't talked about on the forum,

525
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,140
so I want to make this very clear.

526
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:55,760
They actually hired this dance troupe,

527
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,460
this really famous dance troupe called the Groovilloos

528
00:44:58,460 --> 00:45:01,200
to come in and do about 10 shows

529
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,400
throughout the three days of E3,

530
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,520
maybe a little more, 10 to 12 shows,

531
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:06,800
kind of showing off DDR.

532
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:09,420
The Groovilloos were famous because they're actually

533
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,580
the shadow dancers in the iPod commercials,

534
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,180
and they've been in a ton of music videos,

535
00:45:13,180 --> 00:45:21,300
And they're also the same people that are motion-captured for the dancers for Ultra

536
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:22,300
Mix 3.

537
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:24,500
Yes, they're actually going to be motion-captured dancers.

538
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,740
It's a little unclear which game, because some people were saying Ultra Mix 3, and some

539
00:45:27,740 --> 00:45:28,980
people were saying Extreme 2.

540
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:32,180
I think it's Ultra Mix 2, I want to say.

541
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,700
You mean Ultra Mix 3?

542
00:45:33,700 --> 00:45:37,740
No, I think they actually started with probably Ultra Mix 2, because if you remember, they

543
00:45:37,740 --> 00:45:42,820
changed the whole, they re-motion-captured everything for Ultra Mix 2, remember?

544
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,700
Well, regardless, one of the new games, maybe both for all we know, has the Groovaleus being

545
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,780
motion-captured on it, so if you like that dancing in the iPod commercial, that's what

546
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:55,580
Emmy and the new characters, blues and stuff, that's what they're going to look like.

547
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:57,280
I mean, it's going to be awesome.

548
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,900
So going back to what I was saying, the Groovaleus were doing this little show, and the show

549
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:05,380
they did, now they didn't just get up there and play DDR, they actually did a freestyle

550
00:46:05,380 --> 00:46:09,580
thing, they didn't actually have the games running, they weren't actually doing their

551
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:16,020
dancing on DDR, but what I thought was really cool, what they did, they used music from

552
00:46:16,020 --> 00:46:21,140
the various DDR games, and they even did a throwback to Beatmania. They did this thing

553
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:26,740
with Metal Gear Solid, the mix there that's in Beatmania, and they actually were all dancing

554
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:30,700
and the guy had his Beatmania controller, like an air guitar, and he was scratching

555
00:46:30,700 --> 00:46:34,700
on it. I know it sounds a little bit cheesy, but trust me, this was very cool, and they

556
00:46:34,700 --> 00:46:37,580
They got huge crowds around Konami's booth.

557
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,940
Huge crowds checking this out.

558
00:46:38,940 --> 00:46:40,200
These people dancing.

559
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:42,300
And it was really good promotion for the games.

560
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:46,080
One thing I thought was very interesting is that they highlighted all the games.

561
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:49,920
So they actually got one of the girls from the Groovilews would sing like Karaoke Revolution

562
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:50,920
Party.

563
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,220
One of the songs featured in Karaoke Revolution Party is Crazy in Love.

564
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:56,420
So she actually got up there and started singing from Crazy in Love.

565
00:46:56,420 --> 00:46:59,580
And the other guy also sang, you know, Play That Funky Music White Boy.

566
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
That's right.

567
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,580
But this is the thing.

568
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:03,660
Karaoke Revolution Party is going to have this new mode we'll talk about a little later

569
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:07,540
called Sing and Dance Mode, where you can sing and dance at the same time, when she

570
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:11,880
was doing the sing and dance, if you watched her, the dance she was doing lined up with

571
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,840
the arrows. So in a way, even though she wasn't playing the actual game, they actually showed

572
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,980
the video, the Karaoke Revolution Party video, I mean they had it all synced up, and the

573
00:47:19,980 --> 00:47:25,420
dance she was doing was the exact same dance that was on the screen. It was awesome. So,

574
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:29,980
my point, the reason why I'm telling you all this, those of you folks that said that Konami

575
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:34,880
does not support their U.S. audience can now officially shut the fuck up.

576
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:41,880
Seriously, you got served at E3. The Gruvaloos served you. They did. You just

577
00:47:42,420 --> 00:47:49,420
got served. Konami has thrown all of their support by highlighting Karaoke Revolution

578
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:56,540
Party, DDR, two of them, and now Beatmania, all coming out in the U.S. If you still, after

579
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:01,540
If you still, after all of this, think that Konami does not support their U.S. audience

580
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:05,780
when it comes to these music games, nothing is going to satisfy you.

581
00:48:05,780 --> 00:48:06,780
Nothing.

582
00:48:06,780 --> 00:48:09,200
So, honestly, quit.

583
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:10,660
Just quit.

584
00:48:10,660 --> 00:48:12,560
Nothing they do is going to satisfy you.

585
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,980
Go away.

586
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:15,300
We don't need to hear from you anymore.

587
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:16,300
Quit.

588
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:17,460
Do us all a favor.

589
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:23,420
Because it is obvious and apparent that Konami obviously invested a lot of money into this

590
00:48:23,420 --> 00:48:29,060
stuff and that they are throwing their full support behind these new games so

591
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:34,540
so shut up I wanted one of the songs that they were playing there and I don't

592
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:38,500
know what it is someone told me though that was the music from one of the menus

593
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,580
which is pretty cool yeah actually the very first song the

594
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,820
groove loose did was supposedly some type of stage select music or something

595
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:49,540
I wanted it because I can remix it with no limit it would work perfect but I

596
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:53,980
can't find it because it's only in their little dance thing and that makes me sad

597
00:48:53,980 --> 00:49:04,500
but it's alright soon enough but anyways I was gonna say for the um I know we

598
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:07,660
haven't really touched on this yet extreme 2 and stuff but this is kind of

599
00:49:07,660 --> 00:49:12,900
a little off the topic of Japanese DDR you know we had the little thing where

600
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:16,100
they're saying you know oh hey it's a new mix of the teaser things you're

601
00:49:16,100 --> 00:49:35,100
It's extreme 2. Now I know everyone is like, well yeah, of course it's extreme 2, but we know this for a fact, because the exact same footage of which they have a still on their website teasing it, the exact same footage was in the intro for DDR extreme 2. So, it's a fact. It's extreme 2 that they're plugging there.

602
00:49:35,100 --> 00:49:45,100
There's obviously other information that we'll cover probably a little bit later in the show regarding Xtreme 2, at least rumors, and that sort of thing.

603
00:49:45,100 --> 00:49:48,100
But anyways, DDR.

604
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:52,100
Yeah, actually I think we're going to take a break at this point. We're going to come back and do some DDR.

605
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:58,100
We're going to talk about Xtreme 2, and I think before we come back and talk about Xtreme 2, I'm actually going to play one of the brand new songs from Xtreme 2.

606
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:01,420
This is a premiere. I don't think anybody else has played this song yet.

607
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:04,940
So this is a brand new premiere for you guys.

608
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:09,620
I just have to find it here. Let's see, we're gonna do this.

609
00:50:09,620 --> 00:50:13,940
Also, later in the show, we will talk, we're not gonna just talk about Konami.

610
00:50:13,940 --> 00:50:15,780
There were other music games there at the show.

611
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:19,220
Yes, I do want to bring you guys up to speed on what's going on within the groove.

612
00:50:19,220 --> 00:50:22,660
Very interesting what went on at Red Octane's booth. Very, very interesting.

613
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:24,780
So I want to talk about that. And I have played it.

614
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:28,060
Yeah, and Loki finally got to play in the groove for the first time.

615
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:31,980
so he has some things he wants to say about In a Groove. We have some

616
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,620
interesting things to say about Guitar Hero, we'll get into that,

617
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,300
and what else? There's other music games there. Actually, I'm gonna tell you guys about a

618
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:40,060
music game.

619
00:50:40,060 --> 00:50:44,060
I think everybody completely missed because it's on a platform you would have

620
00:50:44,060 --> 00:50:45,100
never expected.

621
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,540
When I was going through my press kits, I discovered this, that there's actually a

622
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:49,700
brand new music game.

623
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:54,580
Nobody even noticed, I think. So we're gonna talk about that all when we come back.

624
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:58,260
For now though, let's get into the song from

625
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,780
EX2. Okay, this is the song. This song is

626
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,740
Naoto Suzuki featuring Martha, and the song is called

627
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:08,780
and I'm gonna mispronounce this first word here

628
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:12,340
Polovcian

629
00:51:12,340 --> 00:51:17,380
Dances and Chorus. This is a brand new song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

630
00:51:17,380 --> 00:51:21,100
I actually only have the full mix, so this is about a five minute song, but you

631
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,380
can expect to see about a minute and a half, two minute edit.

632
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,380
This song was in the demo. It had its own video with it.

633
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:31,380
The deal is, is this is actually from a new game coming out that Konami's putting out called OZ.

634
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,380
And that's really all I know, is that it's some new game that Konami's putting out.

635
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:35,380
It looks spiffy from the video, though.

636
00:51:35,380 --> 00:51:39,380
The video looked pretty hot. It looks like a Castlevania-ish title-ish.

637
00:51:39,380 --> 00:51:42,380
And it'll be nice to actually hear the music since the bass that they had around there.

638
00:51:42,380 --> 00:51:43,380
Yeah.

639
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:45,380
It was a little too loud and I couldn't hear it, but yeah.

640
00:51:45,380 --> 00:51:50,380
So here it is, you guys. World premiere for you guys here on Orange Lounge Radio from DDR Extreme 2.

641
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:56,220
This is the full version of Polovstian, and I'm sorry, I'm totally butchering that word,

642
00:51:56,220 --> 00:51:59,720
Polovstian Dances and Chorus.

643
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:00,720
We'll be back after this.

644
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:26,720
🎶🎶🎶

645
00:56:00,720 --> 00:56:01,720
Hey!

646
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:02,720
Hey!

647
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:03,720
Hey!

648
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:04,720
Hey!

649
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:05,720
Hey!

650
00:56:05,720 --> 00:56:06,720
Hey!

651
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,720
You

652
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:15,320
Hi-ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

653
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:19,240
is brought to you by the letter B, the letter A, and the number 59.

654
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:24,040
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

655
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:28,240
Alright, we are back and that was one of the brand new songs from DDR Extreme 2.

656
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:32,520
The full version there, Palovstian Dances and Chorus.

657
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:33,840
So should be interesting.

658
00:57:33,840 --> 00:57:36,240
Now remember that's going to be trimmed to DDR length.

659
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,200
So if you guys kind of thought, it's a little bit repetitive there and kind of get slow

660
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:43,160
in some parts, don't forget they're going to trim it so that it's more DDR friendly.

661
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:45,960
So you can kind of, you know, the fast parts there with the vocal, that's probably what

662
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,720
you're going to see in the final release.

663
00:57:47,720 --> 00:57:54,020
Honestly, I did play that song in the demo, but it was so darn loud at E3 that I couldn't,

664
00:57:54,020 --> 00:57:55,440
could barely hear the song.

665
00:57:55,440 --> 00:58:00,100
So I couldn't tell you what parts of it specifically are in there, sorry.

666
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:04,520
So but I do, I do remember it was fun and it had a pretty sweet video, so it's exciting

667
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:11,540
that they're going to other games other than just Silent Hill for some of their music.

668
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:15,520
So Konami's tapping into some of their other games. It's kind of cool. And then we'll get

669
00:58:15,520 --> 00:58:19,740
into Ultramix 3, which actually has a song from Castlevania in it, which was originally

670
00:58:19,740 --> 00:58:23,920
in Keyboard Mania. We'll get to that in a little bit. So let's talk about some of the

671
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:28,540
DDRs. We'll start off with Extreme 2, since we played the song there in that break. We

672
00:58:28,540 --> 00:58:32,600
will open up the Skype line in a little bit here for you guys to call in if you have questions

673
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,600
for us about E3, some other things. Let's talk about Xtreme 2 first off. What did you

674
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,600
think of Xtreme 2? You got a chance to play it, right?

675
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:44,140
It was cool. I liked it. I'll probably be buying it.

676
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:48,820
What are some of the differences between Xtreme 2 and Xtreme 1?

677
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:51,840
First off, the interface went back to the old style.

678
00:58:51,840 --> 00:58:58,000
Yes, now it doesn't, not meaning that it copies Xtreme 1's interface, but that Konami basically

679
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:03,360
got the hint that you guys didn't like the interface in Xtreme USA, so they've changed

680
00:59:03,360 --> 00:59:05,480
it back to that style of...

681
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:06,480
The standard song wheel.

682
00:59:06,480 --> 00:59:09,720
Yeah, the song wheel that you guys are familiar with since DDR Max.

683
00:59:09,720 --> 00:59:10,720
Yeah.

684
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:11,720
So, rest easy.

685
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:13,120
It's gonna stick with that, so.

686
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,880
A lot more modes in this time.

687
00:59:16,880 --> 00:59:22,520
I actually got to play the Xtreme 2 in two different locations.

688
00:59:22,520 --> 00:59:26,760
The first one being at Konami's booth, which had, you know, free play mode was the only

689
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:32,600
thing available on it at the moment. I was able to actually play a few songs on there.

690
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:39,880
I tried playing on, what was it, doubles and stuff, but once again Konami only had soft

691
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:49,040
pads, so that was no good. And then I got to play again on the Sony Entertainment booth.

692
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:54,440
I got to play the iToy support, and by the way, there is a new iToy coming out. It looks

693
00:59:54,440 --> 01:00:01,280
a lot smaller, looked pretty cool. And I got to try the new Hands and Feet mode, which

694
01:00:01,280 --> 01:00:09,160
now is available in all difficulties. Unfortunately, it hasn't gotten any better. It just throws

695
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,320
out hands in random spots.

696
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:16,520
Well, now you could get Hands and Feet harder songs in before in Extreme 1, but it was kind

697
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:21,800
of a pain to do it. You had to kind of set things weird to get it, but I remember playing

698
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:25,480
maximizer like heavy on hands and feets and it was stupid. But I thought hands and feet

699
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:29,800
didn't, or if you played it on heavy it did not have the hands. I could swear there was

700
01:00:29,800 --> 01:00:33,320
a way you could get them in there, it's been so long since I played. But regardless it's

701
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:37,640
a lot easier to figure out in Extreme 2, it's more logical the way they have it set up.

702
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,700
They need to put it in edit mode, that's all I'm saying, that's the only thing they need

703
01:00:40,700 --> 01:00:46,120
to do and that option will be awesome because if you can do your own hand motions and set

704
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:51,320
up, you know, that would be a really incredible thing to do because it'll be a lot of fun.

705
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:55,960
I know their hands charts are a little bit on the easy side, all of them being one-footers.

706
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,340
So yeah, I need a little something harder.

707
01:00:59,340 --> 01:01:04,220
Now the interesting thing is I actually played in the heat of the night, heavy, over at Sony's

708
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:07,400
booth where they had the iToy thing set up because they didn't have the iToy thing set

709
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,400
up at Konami's booth.

710
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,480
They weren't really selling the iToy thing.

711
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:15,920
In fact, I don't think anybody mentioned the iToy thing at Konami's booth.

712
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,400
This was something more at Sony's and they were kind of whoring out was the iToy thing.

713
01:01:19,400 --> 01:01:21,320
and they had it set up in their itoy area.

714
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:24,160
The big push for Extreme 2 at Konami's booth

715
01:01:24,160 --> 01:01:25,680
was the online support.

716
01:01:25,680 --> 01:01:28,320
So this is definitely not a rumor anymore.

717
01:01:28,320 --> 01:01:30,440
You will be online with Extreme 2,

718
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:32,040
because this is what they were selling,

719
01:01:32,040 --> 01:01:33,960
is that you're going to be able to do the online mode.

720
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,600
And then the feature I'm going to do later this week,

721
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,080
we actually have screenshots from the online mode that'll

722
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,240
show you kind of what it looks like.

723
01:01:41,240 --> 01:01:43,480
So over at Sony's booth, I actually

724
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,320
played in the heat of the night heavy with hands and feet.

725
01:01:46,320 --> 01:01:48,440
Huge crowd of people watching.

726
01:01:48,440 --> 01:01:49,160
Did you see that?

727
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:52,120
just like tons of people that the reason why I was able to do in the heat of the

728
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:55,040
night heavy because it has a very easy step pattern for a heavy song it's a

729
01:01:55,040 --> 01:01:58,320
very logical seven-footer it's just doo doo doo doo doo doo doo you know do you

730
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,220
just basically run him back and forth on the pad so it's very easy to do the

731
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:04,980
hands you just kind of throw up your hands once in a while people love it I

732
01:02:04,980 --> 01:02:12,700
tried doing what I did go try doing undo twa on on that and once again Sony

733
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:18,360
softpad came to the rescue and failed me and here's why because I was playing

734
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:21,920
hands and feet mode and it was pretty hard as it was to coordinate myself to

735
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:26,480
do hands on under 12 because it has a really strange step pattern to it and

736
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:34,680
then the damn pad stuck to my shoe yay love those soft pads honestly Konami

737
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,880
needs to make some better hard pads if not I don't care if they're as good as

738
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:42,120
the red octane pads but please so they at least have something else that they

739
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:48,640
and demo at E3 next year because, God, I hate those soft pads. I hate them. I hate them.

740
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:52,880
I hate them. You can't play anything. You fail everything. It sucks. They suck. I don't

741
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:59,680
know how I got started on those pads, but they suck. So, give me something better.

742
01:02:59,680 --> 01:03:04,400
All right. Let's talk about some of the songs that are actually going to be in DDR Extreme

743
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:10,780
2. A lot of people very excited that Erotic is finally making its way into a U.S. mix.

744
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:14,700
And this is very interesting, just because a lot of people, especially previously, were

745
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:17,480
like, you know, well, in the grooves, the only way we're ever going to see erotic songs

746
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:18,480
at home.

747
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:20,220
And then Konami kind of pulls this one out.

748
01:03:20,220 --> 01:03:22,540
Oh, nope, we're going to put In the Heat of the Night on there.

749
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:24,260
That's kind of interesting.

750
01:03:24,260 --> 01:03:26,320
I'm not trying to slam one way or the other.

751
01:03:26,320 --> 01:03:30,060
It's just interesting that the timing, the timing always seems to work out that way,

752
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,060
right?

753
01:03:31,060 --> 01:03:32,060
Doesn't it?

754
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:35,180
It doesn't always seem like somebody's yelling about something and then Konami says, oh,

755
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:36,580
here you go.

756
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,580
I don't know.

757
01:03:37,580 --> 01:03:38,580
Exactly.

758
01:03:38,580 --> 01:03:45,340
Um, let's talk about some of the songs that are going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

759
01:03:45,340 --> 01:03:47,660
Erotic and Heat of the Night, of course, as we mentioned.

760
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,660
Genie in a Bottle, but it's a cover of it.

761
01:03:49,660 --> 01:03:53,100
It's by the NC featuring NRG Factory.

762
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:58,420
So I'm wondering if that isn't one of those karaoke revolution crossovers.

763
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,420
No.

764
01:03:59,420 --> 01:04:00,420
It really?

765
01:04:00,420 --> 01:04:05,180
It was kind of a clubby, imagine, you remember how Oops I Did It Again was kind of clubby?

766
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:06,180
Yeah.

767
01:04:06,180 --> 01:04:07,180
It's like that.

768
01:04:07,180 --> 01:04:08,180
Huh.

769
01:04:08,180 --> 01:04:12,340
I listened to the, I didn't play it, hell no, I'm not touching that song, but I listened

770
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:16,340
to the little, you know, loop that they have there when you're playing, you know, in the

771
01:04:16,340 --> 01:04:22,040
song selection screen, and it listened, it sounded just like, oops, I did it again.

772
01:04:22,040 --> 01:04:24,160
So that was kind of cool.

773
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:28,980
Sean Paul with Get Busy, now again, I don't listen to a whole lot of mainstream music,

774
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:32,620
so I had no idea that this was a pretty big song.

775
01:04:32,620 --> 01:04:34,740
I really had the video for it.

776
01:04:34,740 --> 01:04:36,740
Yeah, and the video was in it.

777
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:38,960
1998 from Naoki.

778
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:42,460
Now, the rest of this song list, a lot of these read-like

779
01:04:42,460 --> 01:04:43,900
songs that people were complaining

780
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,660
were in Extreme 1.

781
01:04:45,660 --> 01:04:49,540
Le More et la Liberté by Naoki Underground.

782
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:51,820
Une de Trois, of course, is mentioned.

783
01:04:51,820 --> 01:04:53,140
And then some other songs as well.

784
01:04:53,140 --> 01:04:57,520
Can Be Real, Vision F. La Bamba from DDR Extreme, of

785
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,460
course, showed up there.

786
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:00,940
A new song by Sotav called Saturday Night

787
01:05:00,940 --> 01:05:02,620
Love was in there as well.

788
01:05:02,620 --> 01:05:03,780
I played that a little bit.

789
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,220
I didn't quite hear it, though.

790
01:05:05,220 --> 01:05:06,380
Yeah, it was hard to hear.

791
01:05:06,380 --> 01:05:09,980
Too loud.

792
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,380
Tons of characters are going to show up in Xtreme 2 as well.

793
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:15,880
Did you see the new character select screen on some of the screenshots that are online?

794
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:16,880
Pretty big.

795
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,540
Crazy amounts of characters in there.

796
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:22,100
Rumor is, and I didn't see this and I haven't seen this in the press release either, but

797
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:25,140
I was reading in some of the forums, rumor is that it's supposed to have some type of

798
01:05:25,140 --> 01:05:29,640
like store mode where you earn points and buy things with the points.

799
01:05:29,640 --> 01:05:36,880
I guess. I mean, that sounds sort of like the mode that they had in Extreme for the

800
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:44,700
Japanese one, I think. No, it wasn't Extreme. It was Festival Mix. Remember where you could

801
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:49,240
actually customize your characters a little bit? Sounds very similar to that.

802
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:52,960
Yeah. In fact, it sounds like a lot of this is actually very similar to, like, we're getting

803
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:58,060
kind of like Festival with some new stuff as well.

804
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:01,940
One of the screenshots that actually we got in the press kit actually revealed some other

805
01:06:01,940 --> 01:06:04,300
songs that weren't in the demo.

806
01:06:04,300 --> 01:06:08,540
And the other songs that weren't actually in the demo were B-Lovin' by D-Crew is going

807
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,540
to show up in the game as well.

808
01:06:09,540 --> 01:06:12,180
So you remember B-Lovin' from DDR Extreme.

809
01:06:12,180 --> 01:06:19,020
And then Yuzo Koshiro featuring Julie Rugard with a song called You Gotta Move It.

810
01:06:19,020 --> 01:06:21,880
So those songs are going to show up in DDR Extreme as well.

811
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:24,460
So it should be interesting.

812
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:31,780
DDR Extreme 2 also having a Mission Mode thing in it, or I guess it's like Dance Master Mode,

813
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:33,980
where you're kind of like climbing around this tree.

814
01:06:33,980 --> 01:06:38,540
Again, these are things that were not available in the demo that they had at E3.

815
01:06:38,540 --> 01:06:41,180
These are just things we're getting off the screenshots that were available in the press

816
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,180
kit.

817
01:06:42,180 --> 01:06:48,100
A very souped up version of Mission Mode called Dance Master Mode.

818
01:06:48,100 --> 01:06:54,180
And then just some, of course, new backgrounds and new screens.

819
01:06:54,180 --> 01:06:58,100
grading system, it kind of clicks around and makes a little like beep, beep, beep, beep,

820
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:59,100
beep.

821
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:00,860
When it's scrolling through the different grades, it kind of sounds like the Price is

822
01:07:00,860 --> 01:07:03,080
Right wheel or something, I don't know.

823
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:08,900
And then there's an online play that you, we can see the options on the screenshot,

824
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:14,660
head to head, ranking challenge, practice, data options, and logout.

825
01:07:14,660 --> 01:07:17,860
What's really interesting though about the screenshot, and I don't get this, but at the

826
01:07:17,860 --> 01:07:25,540
very top it says 32 weeks from beginning 144 minutes until the end. I have no idea

827
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:29,420
what that's supposed to mean. That's like how long you've been playing online or

828
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:35,260
what that's supposed to mean? Who knows? I don't know. There was, for example, see

829
01:07:35,260 --> 01:07:39,220
right there, that's the shot. Obviously, you know, we can't... Yeah, I'm actually

830
01:07:39,220 --> 01:07:43,980
scanning through some of the screen... Whoa! What was that? That was weird, I don't know.

831
01:07:43,980 --> 01:07:46,660
We're actually scanning through some of the screenshots in the press kit right now and

832
01:07:46,660 --> 01:07:52,220
you actually can see screens that are in that teaser that was on the Japanese

833
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:56,740
site so this is this game for those of you that are interested in what's coming

834
01:07:56,740 --> 01:07:59,620
next in Japan it's going to be a port of extreme 2 as if you couldn't figure that

835
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:06,100
out already yeah and I just wanted to point something out here too and I heard

836
01:08:06,100 --> 01:08:10,660
this and I have to see it in my screenshots there but apparently in one

837
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:17,460
the backgrounds here we have a familiar little background I'm trying to find it

838
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,900
here thank God they didn't have the pictures of those people dancing with

839
01:08:20,900 --> 01:08:23,820
the eye toy like they did last year and you've gone through all the pictures now

840
01:08:23,820 --> 01:08:28,900
okay wait wait apparently and I didn't see this but apparently someone saw like

841
01:08:28,900 --> 01:08:32,780
a video that was on a website or whatever it had the familiar dancing

842
01:08:32,780 --> 01:08:40,380
bears you know those familiar dancing bears from Romeo and Juliet oh yeah and

843
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:42,380
and someone thought that that song might be in there.

844
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:43,180
I hope not, because that's awesome.

845
01:08:43,180 --> 01:08:46,180
But I think, weren't they in the video to be lovin'?

846
01:08:46,180 --> 01:08:49,340
I think they were, so I think people are smoking crack,

847
01:08:49,340 --> 01:08:50,780
but you know, whatever.

848
01:08:50,780 --> 01:08:52,340
We'll see, we'll see.

849
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:54,580
All right, so that's going to do it

850
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:56,060
for us talking about Xtreme 2.

851
01:08:56,060 --> 01:08:59,140
Let's move on to talking about the other dance game.

852
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:01,620
Oh, and I'd like to mention, their Xtreme 2

853
01:09:01,620 --> 01:09:03,260
logo does look very nice.

854
01:09:03,260 --> 01:09:05,380
It does.

855
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:06,940
I was very disappointed it wasn't purple.

856
01:09:06,940 --> 01:09:08,220
Yeah, you didn't get your purple interface.

857
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,300
It's a very bluish green.

858
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,740
It was, yeah, it was, it looked nice, though.

859
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:14,220
All right, let's move on to talk about the other

860
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:15,900
dancing game Konami was showing off.

861
01:09:15,900 --> 01:09:18,800
They were not showing DDR with Mario at Konami's booth,

862
01:09:18,800 --> 01:09:20,180
by the way, but we will get into that.

863
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,580
They like to disavow all knowledge of DDR with Mario.

864
01:09:22,580 --> 01:09:24,940
It's DDR Mario Mix is actually what they're calling it,

865
01:09:24,940 --> 01:09:27,380
and it didn't show up until you actually walked over

866
01:09:27,380 --> 01:09:28,520
to Nintendo's booth.

867
01:09:28,520 --> 01:09:30,380
In fact, I have kind of a funny story.

868
01:09:30,380 --> 01:09:31,260
We'll get into that a little bit,

869
01:09:31,260 --> 01:09:33,400
but let's talk Ultra Mix 3.

870
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:35,380
What'd you think of Ultra Mix 3, Loki?

871
01:09:35,380 --> 01:09:36,220
That was cool.

872
01:09:36,220 --> 01:09:37,740
I liked it, I played it.

873
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:43,780
It was interesting, did a lot of weird things with it, all of which we'll mention.

874
01:09:43,780 --> 01:09:47,860
The first thing I noticed, obviously the interface hasn't really changed much, it is now kind

875
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:48,860
of an aqua theme.

876
01:09:48,860 --> 01:09:49,860
Yeah, it's like water.

877
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:51,260
But that's cool, though.

878
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,420
That's cool because it's not some generic, like, woo, look, it's background videos.

879
01:09:54,420 --> 01:09:57,340
No, this is all, like, you know, actually water themed.

880
01:09:57,340 --> 01:09:59,660
It looked pretty cool.

881
01:09:59,660 --> 01:10:00,940
Good song list so far.

882
01:10:00,940 --> 01:10:07,540
Again, an early, early build because a lot of stuff changed from UltraMix II's E3 show.

883
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:10,580
Remember guys, Ultramix 2 at last year's E3 sucked.

884
01:10:10,580 --> 01:10:14,180
We dogged on it and said it was going to be a horrible mix, and it turns out it was one

885
01:10:14,180 --> 01:10:15,940
of the best mixes they ever released.

886
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:22,180
The preview for Ultramix 3 this year was actually really kick-ass, and so it's amazing to think

887
01:10:22,180 --> 01:10:24,620
what this is going to become when it's actually released.

888
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:28,220
But if there's a lot of negative feedback to the Aqua theme or some of the characters,

889
01:10:28,220 --> 01:10:29,780
this stuff could change.

890
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:32,100
But there was no Hoochie Mama Emmy this time to speak of.

891
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:34,380
In fact, it looks like the characters are actually different, some of them.

892
01:10:34,380 --> 01:10:38,460
disappointments I had the character select you can only select characters

893
01:10:38,460 --> 01:10:43,220
with L and R can't do that on a pad so you're stuck with the default character

894
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:50,100
interesting then what else there was some pretty cool new songs that were on

895
01:10:50,100 --> 01:10:54,140
there we have a new MIDI head remix that was in there yes and we're gonna

896
01:10:54,140 --> 01:10:57,140
actually play that very soon MIDI head is going to do a new remix it's called

897
01:10:57,140 --> 01:11:03,500
jelly kiss MIDI heads smack mix also in UltraMix 3 we're gonna have Akumajo

898
01:11:03,500 --> 01:11:08,060
Dracula medley that is the Castlevania songs compilation that is in keyboard

899
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:13,140
mania is crossing over I have been begging for this song for two years and

900
01:11:13,140 --> 01:11:17,100
it's finally there I would like to think that I am directly responsible for the

901
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:20,020
song being in there but I'll just keep and for all you people that were

902
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:25,760
bitching and moaning before yes you're damn stupid max ripoff song Sakura is in

903
01:11:25,760 --> 01:11:29,260
there yeah Sakura is showing up in ultra mix 3 which has a lot of people bitching

904
01:11:29,260 --> 01:11:32,980
that it's not showing up in Xtreme 2 yet, but a lot can change.

905
01:11:32,980 --> 01:11:38,340
God, people, are you never happy? Honestly, that song is just a stupid Max remix. I mean,

906
01:11:38,340 --> 01:11:44,420
come on, folks. Just, you know, just because it's in UltraMix 3 does not mean it's not

907
01:11:44,420 --> 01:11:48,660
gonna show up in Xtreme 2. We just don't know yet. It's a limited song list. Another song

908
01:11:48,660 --> 01:11:53,020
people have been bitching about for forever, finally coming to the USA after years and

909
01:11:53,020 --> 01:11:56,060
years, Butterfly, Smile DK.

910
01:11:56,060 --> 01:12:00,060
I had to laugh, that was funny, cause um, oh god, I can't remember.

911
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:02,060
Didn't people say, oh smile decay hates Konami now?

912
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:05,060
Who was that freestyling Kyle Snyder's routine?

913
01:12:05,060 --> 01:12:06,060
Lil B.

914
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,060
Lil B, yeah he was up there, that was funny.

915
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:11,060
So Butterfly is going to be in UltraMix 3.

916
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:13,060
Finally, like how many home releases is this later?

917
01:12:13,060 --> 01:12:15,060
Eleven home mixes later or something?

918
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:16,060
We get Butterfly.

919
01:12:16,060 --> 01:12:18,060
Uh, Breakdown would be for you.

920
01:12:18,060 --> 01:12:21,060
Togo featuring Sana Miracle Moon, LED light style.

921
01:12:21,060 --> 01:12:23,060
Daikonkai is going to show up.

922
01:12:23,060 --> 01:12:25,060
You guys love to whore that song out.

923
01:12:25,060 --> 01:12:33,520
Firefly, Be For You, Destiny Lovers, The Legend of Max, Emotion, Kiss Me All Night Long, Eversnow,

924
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:34,860
and Candy Star.

925
01:12:34,860 --> 01:12:39,140
Pretty impressive song list so far, lots of songs playable in the UltraMix 3 demo.

926
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:43,260
Other things different about UltraMix, there was a brand new freestyle mode.

927
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:45,340
Yeah, kind of interesting.

928
01:12:45,340 --> 01:12:46,760
I got to play that.

929
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:47,760
It was very interesting.

930
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:52,700
Basically, there are no arrows, but the way it works is, it's even kind of very strange.

931
01:12:52,700 --> 01:12:55,640
kind of got this thing on the bottom of the screen it looks like kind of like a

932
01:12:55,640 --> 01:13:00,000
heart meter and it's going across and there's a line in the middle line is

933
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,400
basically on the quarter note for every you know beat so basically what you need

934
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:11,000
to do the object of that is I guess I don't know how they grade you on it but

935
01:13:11,000 --> 01:13:16,120
you basically it's like variety and like how fast you step and stuff and

936
01:13:16,120 --> 01:13:21,760
basically how in like tune with the song you're stepping and stuff and they grade

937
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:28,300
you on like variety or like it's like intensity and stuff like that and they

938
01:13:28,300 --> 01:13:31,660
give you a grading at the end but you basically can do whatever you want and

939
01:13:31,660 --> 01:13:35,420
you get this like and if you count your calories as you burn yeah so it's very

940
01:13:35,420 --> 01:13:39,260
interesting it's gonna be a very neat kind of addition like it sounds sounded

941
01:13:39,260 --> 01:13:43,580
kind of lame it's like oh it's like you know why don't you try some hold notes

942
01:13:43,580 --> 01:13:47,100
or something like that and it was very strange that was something new that was

943
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:53,340
in there. And then the brand new thing, which is really strange, quest mode. Quest mode

944
01:13:53,340 --> 01:13:59,180
is more interesting than I thought it would be. Quest mode actually seems very similar

945
01:13:59,180 --> 01:14:04,900
to the mission mode that's showing up in Xtreme 2, except instead of just this giant tree,

946
01:14:04,900 --> 01:14:10,020
you have this states and capitals map. So you have a map of the states of the union

947
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:15,300
with all the various capitals, and you start quest mode in Orange Lounge's home of Sacramento.

948
01:14:15,300 --> 01:14:18,400
Thank you very much. And that was done for us, by the way. No, I'm kidding.

949
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,760
And what's also great about that is you have to pick up your

950
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:25,980
dance crew, I guess, along the way. I only played a little bit of quest mode and I didn't

951
01:14:25,980 --> 01:14:28,560
really... it looked like you had to earn a certain amount of points to

952
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:32,760
capture a state or something. It looked a little cheesy, but

953
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:37,040
you know, it adds some replay value to UltraMix 3. What the heck, right? And it'll

954
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:39,240
probably be a method to unlock some new songs.

955
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,480
Hey, it's creative. Why not, huh? It's not bad.

956
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:45,040
It's not bad. It's not as cheesy as you would think.

957
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:46,720
It's pretty cool.

958
01:14:46,720 --> 01:14:50,080
So if you live in a state capital, you'll be able to play in your

959
01:14:50,080 --> 01:14:54,880
home ground on the quest mode in UltraMix 3.

960
01:14:54,880 --> 01:14:57,880
Let's get into this. We actually have

961
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:01,080
a E3 bootleg exclusive,

962
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:06,200
and you know this is Loki's fault. Loki, what did you do here? I recorded the MIDI Head

963
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,680
remix with

964
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:11,200
this really crappy mic and a really crappy digital

965
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:12,760
recorder that I have

966
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:16,760
and therefore you get this really crappy quality recording

967
01:15:16,760 --> 01:15:20,160
but it's the only one you're going to hear unless you were there

968
01:15:20,160 --> 01:15:23,640
and we have to preface this, the reason why we had to record this for you guys is

969
01:15:23,640 --> 01:15:25,200
the Jelly Kiss remix

970
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:26,400
is very hot

971
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,160
it is very hot, it is

972
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:33,000
incredible at his remixes, he's so good at remixing the songs

973
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:36,920
I played this song about twenty five times while I was there

974
01:15:36,920 --> 01:15:38,200
so um...

975
01:15:38,200 --> 01:15:41,160
honestly I wish I had a better mix for you

976
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:44,920
because this doesn't do it justice but it's still hot. This will just have to

977
01:15:44,920 --> 01:15:46,920
kind of at least you can get an idea but

978
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:51,060
trust me, guys, this is a very crappy quality. This is like crappy

979
01:15:51,060 --> 01:15:52,920
location test quality, okay?

980
01:15:52,920 --> 01:15:58,180
This is like Beatmania 2DX test location

981
01:15:58,180 --> 01:16:02,440
with a microphone, okay? At least I actually had a microphone and then just used the

982
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,400
microphone on the tape recorder

983
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:07,840
because that would have sucked even worse. Let's see how bad this is because I haven't heard how bad the

984
01:16:07,840 --> 01:16:11,600
quality though it's pretty bad all right well let's see well I might have to cut

985
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:15,200
this off if it's too bad I don't come on you got all right all right a minute like

986
01:16:15,200 --> 01:16:18,560
fine it's a minute 47 seconds if you don't like the quality you just turn

987
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,120
down your speakers but trust me you guys this song is so hot

988
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:25,580
Jelly Kiss, Midi Head, Smack Mix, bootleg version

989
01:16:25,580 --> 01:16:27,580
Orange launch radio exclusive

990
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:57,580
It's all in here!

991
01:18:12,920 --> 01:18:16,360
Honestly guys, that recording doesn't do the song justice,

992
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:19,940
But you could hear you could hear that the remix is really good

993
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:22,480
You could at least get an idea of what it sounds like.

994
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:29,220
It's not great, but you know, I tried the best I could to clean that up and it just was not yet doing me any good

995
01:18:29,220 --> 01:18:32,820
Please don't base your opinion of that song off that recording

996
01:18:32,820 --> 01:18:38,160
but at least that's really for the hardcore fans to wet your appetite a little bit for the real thing gives you an idea of what's

997
01:18:38,160 --> 01:18:43,460
Gonna sound like and it sounded really cool when I heard it. I was like, ah, I gotta play this so it'll be cool

998
01:18:43,460 --> 01:18:45,540
I don't doubt it. But uh

999
01:18:45,540 --> 01:18:51,180
again guys it was like what a $20 digital recorder how much was like a

1000
01:18:51,180 --> 01:18:55,900
little cheap digital digital recorder was a little bit more than $20 but

1001
01:18:55,900 --> 01:19:00,100
wasn't much but yeah the mic was like ten bucks I mean come on oh yeah the

1002
01:19:00,100 --> 01:19:03,860
mic oh gosh it was that same microphone we use for our podcasts away from home

1003
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,460
$10 mic see like if I had professional recording equipment actually what I

1004
01:19:08,460 --> 01:19:12,580
would have preferred to do but obviously I had no access to do this would be to

1005
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:17,020
pull one of the audio connectors out of the speaker and actually hook it up directly to

1006
01:19:17,020 --> 01:19:22,820
it. Ideally, you know, if I had known somebody that worked there that would let me do that,

1007
01:19:22,820 --> 01:19:27,620
that'd be awesome, because I would have had the tools to do that. But yeah, right, like

1008
01:19:27,620 --> 01:19:30,460
they're actually going to let me bootleg this song.

1009
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,220
What you did was crazy enough. I couldn't believe, because there was a Konami person

1010
01:19:34,220 --> 01:19:38,340
that walked right by you as you were doing that. I couldn't believe that they were cool

1011
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,020
with it. I not only did that once, I did that twice,

1012
01:19:40,020 --> 01:19:46,300
Because the first time, somehow my erase button got stuck down, so it got erased the first

1013
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,300
time.

1014
01:19:47,300 --> 01:19:50,960
And I did that, the first time was on the stage, I did that right there.

1015
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:58,220
So no one really cared, but I really wish I had a plug that could have just gotten a

1016
01:19:58,220 --> 01:20:00,220
game copy of it.

1017
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:04,100
Some folks in the chat room are begging us to put that bootleg copy up somewhere.

1018
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:09,460
I'll have to think about it, because I really don't want people to think that this is what

1019
01:20:09,460 --> 01:20:14,340
the song is actually going to sound like because it will be much better. Hopefully, Midihead,

1020
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:17,860
he likes to put these things up on his site. Hopefully, he'll do something for the fans

1021
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:18,860
over there.

1022
01:20:18,860 --> 01:20:19,860
We'll beg.

1023
01:20:19,860 --> 01:20:23,580
We'll say, we'll beg and plead. Everybody go to Midihead's site and beg and plead. But

1024
01:20:23,580 --> 01:20:26,780
he might not be able to. Don't beg too much, because if he says he can't, then he can't.

1025
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:30,540
I mean, Konami might be wanting to put this on a V-Rare later or something, so.

1026
01:20:30,540 --> 01:20:32,340
Oh, it will be on a V-Rare, I'm sure.

1027
01:20:32,340 --> 01:20:37,020
He might not be able to do it, so don't bug him too much. If he says no, leave him alone.

1028
01:20:37,020 --> 01:20:39,500
But if there's even a possibility, he might do it.

1029
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:42,340
Bug him.

1030
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:44,420
All right.

1031
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,460
Let's go to a break.

1032
01:20:45,460 --> 01:20:47,580
Let's do a break, because we need to stretch a

1033
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:49,380
little bit here.

1034
01:20:49,380 --> 01:20:51,180
Just a rundown of the different modes that are going

1035
01:20:51,180 --> 01:20:53,300
to be in UltraMix 3 as well before we get a break.

1036
01:20:53,300 --> 01:20:56,980
Party mode, freestyle, quest mode, workout mode, challenge

1037
01:20:56,980 --> 01:21:00,820
mode, playing online, Xbox Live, training mode, edit mode,

1038
01:21:00,820 --> 01:21:02,700
jukebox mode, which is something we didn't mention,

1039
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,940
but it wasn't playable in the demo.

1040
01:21:03,940 --> 01:21:04,440
That's why.

1041
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:07,720
But we imagine it's just the videos and nothing else.

1042
01:21:07,720 --> 01:21:09,440
Kind of like 2Box Mode and 2DX.

1043
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:11,960
And options, of course.

1044
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:14,600
I love playing the options mode.

1045
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,780
We're going to go to a break.

1046
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:18,280
And when we come back from this break, what we're going to do

1047
01:21:18,280 --> 01:21:20,880
is we're going to talk a little bit about DDR with Mario, or

1048
01:21:20,880 --> 01:21:23,240
DDR Mario Mix, as they're going to call it in the US.

1049
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:24,560
We're going to talk about In the Groove.

1050
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,800
I still want to talk In the Groove.

1051
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,800
And we want to get Loki's thoughts on

1052
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,200
In the Groove as well.

1053
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,520
And we're going to take your call from Step Line.

1054
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:37,520
Also, Loki tries a bunch of different hardpads in succession, making him very tired.

1055
01:21:37,520 --> 01:21:42,520
Alright, yeah, yeah, that's, oh yeah, we gotta talk about that. Some of the other

1056
01:21:42,520 --> 01:21:46,520
Kenshiya Hall tour that we did, little Kenshiya Hall tour that we did.

1057
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:52,520
And, yeah, I want to also touch on how I almost got in trouble a few times at the

1058
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:58,520
Infinity Gaming booth with their Feel 3.

1059
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:02,760
we'll talk about that. So in this break I thought what we could do is actually do

1060
01:22:02,760 --> 01:22:05,960
some music from UltraMix 3 because we actually have a lot of the songs

1061
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:11,000
already in rotation on Orange Lounge Radio, our music program that runs 24

1062
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:13,320
hours a day seven days a week, we're not here, so we're gonna play some of the

1063
01:22:13,320 --> 01:22:15,880
songs that are gonna be featured in UltraMix 3 in case you guys haven't

1064
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:20,440
heard them yet. And should we also mention that one of our cast members is

1065
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:26,160
no longer with us? Yes, we should mention this, one of our cast members is no

1066
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:31,120
longer with the show they are they have been snatched up by the katamari yes

1067
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:35,560
they have been stuck on the giant katamari and gone forever and that is

1068
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:40,480
one of our ferrets and it's actually the ferret in question is the ferret that

1069
01:22:40,480 --> 01:22:45,320
was broken and Loki actually operated on him it was one of the ones I operated on

1070
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,080
and it's also one of the ones that it's one of Jamie's favorites the one it's

1071
01:22:49,080 --> 01:22:54,500
all you know it's all which made me even happier to get rid of it sorry Jamie if

1072
01:22:54,500 --> 01:22:57,980
So now we have old ferrets still here, but the new ferret.

1073
01:22:57,980 --> 01:23:02,680
We still do have one of the ferrets here, and this is Jamie's absolute favorite ferret.

1074
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:04,260
So he's still here.

1075
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:07,620
Hmm, actually that might be the old one, or the new one.

1076
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,060
Isn't this the old school ferret?

1077
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:10,060
I thought that was the new one.

1078
01:23:10,060 --> 01:23:11,060
Was that the very first ferret?

1079
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,060
I don't remember.

1080
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:14,060
Yeah, that might be the old one.

1081
01:23:14,060 --> 01:23:15,060
I think it is.

1082
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,060
Whatever.

1083
01:23:16,060 --> 01:23:17,060
All right.

1084
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,060
So one of the ferrets is gone.

1085
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,060
I like our chat room.

1086
01:23:20,060 --> 01:23:21,620
www.orangeonstrator.com, click on chat.

1087
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,500

1150
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,380
Yeah

1151
01:25:37,380 --> 01:26:00,900
🎵

1152
01:28:07,380 --> 01:28:09,380
Oh

1153
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:25,380
Music

1154
01:29:37,380 --> 01:29:44,380
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1155
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:12,460
to play it just because, I don't know, it just wasn't my thing. You know, it looked

1156
01:30:12,460 --> 01:30:18,780
a little easy. It looked kind of very Disney-ravish, and I just didn't want to touch it. But it

1157
01:30:18,780 --> 01:30:24,340
looked interesting, different. This is the thing about DDR Mario Mix. They actually weren't

1158
01:30:24,340 --> 01:30:27,620
showing this at Konami's booth. You actually had to go over to Nintendo's booth to see

1159
01:30:27,620 --> 01:30:32,580
this. And what's really interesting is I asked somebody at Konami's booth, who I know kind

1160
01:30:32,580 --> 01:30:36,940
of well, what's up with DDR with Mario? And they were like, oh, it's a Japanese-only release.

1161
01:30:36,940 --> 01:30:41,260
I'm like, okay. Then I walk over to Nintendo's booth and there it is. They're showing it.

1162
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:44,060
I'm like, you lied to me. Too many people lied to me this E3.

1163
01:30:44,060 --> 01:30:45,540
You're a dirty liar.

1164
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:54,540
Too many dirty liars at E3. But we actually went over to the Nintendo booth and ended

1165
01:30:54,540 --> 01:30:58,420
up seeing DDR with Mario. And I actually got to play, and this is the weird thing about

1166
01:30:58,420 --> 01:31:02,280
DDR with Mario. I played a song, I want to say it was like the Hammer Brothers medley

1167
01:31:02,280 --> 01:31:06,340
or something, it was a song I played. It's so loud at E3 you can't hear the song anyway.

1168
01:31:06,340 --> 01:31:10,900
played it and I played it on very hard mode which is only one step below the

1169
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:15,340
hardest mode that's in there super hard I played it on very hard and not every

1170
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:18,820
song even has super hard steps in fact very hard was as high as the hammer

1171
01:31:18,820 --> 01:31:22,940
brothers song went I would say it was about the equivalent of a five-footer

1172
01:31:22,940 --> 01:31:29,980
and I triple-a'd it my first try hmm so that's about the skill level you're

1173
01:31:29,980 --> 01:31:34,020
gonna see on DDR Mario mix okay and I'm not one of those people that can like

1174
01:31:34,020 --> 01:31:40,580
AAA every song, okay? I've AAA'd some songs, but nothing that crazy. So DDR Mario

1175
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:46,880
mix is definitely not for the hardcore DDR player, unless you happen to be a fan

1176
01:31:46,880 --> 01:31:50,740
of Mario as well. Then, you know, then you might like this mix because it's gonna

1177
01:31:50,740 --> 01:31:56,860
have a lot of songs especially for you in this. But as far as, you know, the DDR

1178
01:31:56,860 --> 01:32:00,460
person that's looking for the next 10 footer and is hoping that it's gonna be

1179
01:32:00,460 --> 01:32:04,740
the, you know, star medley in Mario is going to be a 10-footer, I highly doubt it.

1180
01:32:04,740 --> 01:32:07,020
This is a mix that's going to be for kids, mostly.

1181
01:32:07,020 --> 01:32:08,020
Yeah.

1182
01:32:08,020 --> 01:32:09,020
Yeah.

1183
01:32:09,020 --> 01:32:15,100
Um, let's look at, um, some of the songs that are going to be in Dance Dance Revolution

1184
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,100
with Mario.

1185
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:19,500
It was really, did you actually take a look at the song list at all?

1186
01:32:19,500 --> 01:32:23,500
Um, a little bit, not, very briefly.

1187
01:32:23,500 --> 01:32:26,820
But did you see any songs in there that weren't from a Mario game?

1188
01:32:26,820 --> 01:32:27,820
No.

1189
01:32:27,820 --> 01:32:31,560
DDR Mario mix but with Nintendo putting this out you would still think you'd get

1190
01:32:31,560 --> 01:32:38,340
maybe I don't know a Donkey Kong song or a Zelda song or something no all Mario

1191
01:32:38,340 --> 01:32:44,340
songs starring Wario boo boogie rollercoasting hammer dance blooper bop

1192
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:49,300
in the whirlpool fishing frenzy jump jump jump destruction dance garden boogie

1193
01:32:49,300 --> 01:32:54,420
underground Mozart here we go up down left right always smiling rendezvous on

1194
01:32:54,420 --> 01:33:01,220
Ice, Deep Freeze, Cabin Freezer, Cabin Fever, and Frozen Pipes are the songs in

1195
01:33:01,220 --> 01:33:07,260
Dance Mystery Revolution of Mario. Also should be noted about DDR Mario mix, only

1196
01:33:07,260 --> 01:33:10,780
going to be like 30 songs at most. It's not going to be a very big mix at all.

1197
01:33:10,780 --> 01:33:16,860
Yeah. So this is, this is something you're gonna get for your five or seven year

1198
01:33:16,860 --> 01:33:21,380
old cousin that wants to get into DDR. Unless you are a Nintendo addict, a

1199
01:33:21,380 --> 01:33:23,940
Nintendo junkie, there's nothing wrong with that. I love Nintendo. You know what,

1200
01:33:23,940 --> 01:33:25,940
This is not for you.

1201
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:59,020
Jungle Beat where it uses the DDR pad, but it's not a music game. Yeah

1202
01:34:00,020 --> 01:34:04,260
So I'm hoping hopefully something like that will come out justifying this purchase

1203
01:34:04,560 --> 01:34:10,980
You know, I I don't want to knock this because I think you know Nintendo has always been they do a lot of kid-friendly things

1204
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:13,260
So I think this is gonna be a good thing

1205
01:34:13,260 --> 01:34:16,360
I'm not gonna sit here and knock this mix because I think it's gonna be a good thing

1206
01:34:16,360 --> 01:34:19,900
I think a lot of the Mario music is very good. I think it's gonna be a fun thing

1207
01:34:19,900 --> 01:34:24,540
I think if you have a lot of parties and you have friends over that don't play DDR very much

1208
01:34:24,540 --> 01:34:26,860
This is going to be a mix that can really

1209
01:34:27,460 --> 01:34:31,380
Enable them to get into DDR a little more Nintendo knows one thing

1210
01:34:31,380 --> 01:34:32,800
It's how to make a party game

1211
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:37,800
And so I don't doubt that one bit that any sort of party mode on that would be perfect

1212
01:34:37,820 --> 01:34:43,260
So I'm not gonna say, you know, DDR Mario mix sucks because it doesn't it's just different

1213
01:34:43,260 --> 01:34:49,580
It's not for you hardcore players. It's for kids and you know people that you know

1214
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:52,700
or not familiar with DDR, but maybe are Nintendo fans.

1215
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:55,340
I think this could expose DDR to a whole new audience, which

1216
01:34:55,340 --> 01:34:56,220
is a good thing.

1217
01:34:56,220 --> 01:34:58,420
Definitely.

1218
01:34:58,420 --> 01:35:01,660
Questions from our chat room.

1219
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:05,940
So does Nintendo have a release time frame for DDR Mario Mix?

1220
01:35:08,860 --> 01:35:11,960
We don't know of anything, because we didn't get a

1221
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,260
Nintendo press kit.

1222
01:35:13,260 --> 01:35:15,220
But Jamie's in our chat right now, and I'm wondering if she

1223
01:35:15,220 --> 01:35:17,500
was able to schmooze her way to get a press kit.

1224
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:19,500
We think by end of year.

1225
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,500
Hasn't everything we've been reading saying like October, November time frame-ish?

1226
01:35:22,500 --> 01:35:26,500
By the way, UltraMix 3 and Extreme 2 are looking at the same time frame.

1227
01:35:26,500 --> 01:35:28,500
Will be released, you know, end of year-ish.

1228
01:35:28,500 --> 01:35:31,500
Definitely in time for the holiday season.

1229
01:35:31,500 --> 01:35:34,500
I do remember Nintendogs is out August 22nd.

1230
01:35:34,500 --> 01:35:35,500
That's the one thing I did here.

1231
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:37,500
Nintendogs, by the way.

1232
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:42,500
On the podcast, I named Nintendogs my favorite game of the whole damn show.

1233
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:43,500
Nintendogs is gonna rock.

1234
01:35:43,500 --> 01:35:45,500
I can't wait for that game.

1235
01:35:45,500 --> 01:35:54,500
gonna be friggin awesome so cute I just love dogs no but really um I can't wait

1236
01:35:54,500 --> 01:36:00,780
for that Mario Kart advanced or not advanced so DS kind of disappointed me

1237
01:36:00,780 --> 01:36:08,600
but um anyways um let's see here I was just gonna check real quick check some

1238
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:13,300
of the websites online see if we can answer that question yeah if I can't

1239
01:36:13,300 --> 01:36:18,220
figure out when it's coming out, nope to be announced 2005. It's gonna be out this

1240
01:36:18,220 --> 01:36:22,860
year I would say bank on October November that time frame I think that's

1241
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:26,500
a good it's got to be out for the holiday season honestly. By the way if

1242
01:36:26,500 --> 01:36:29,660
you're a Nintendo fan another title not to miss that's coming out next month

1243
01:36:29,660 --> 01:36:36,900
Meteos. Awesome puzzle game, awesome puzzle game. Let's see what are the

1244
01:36:36,900 --> 01:36:40,420
Bomani games? I think that's it I think that's all the official Bomani

1245
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:45,620
releases that are coming out, so that takes us to the one of the money. So down

1246
01:36:45,620 --> 01:36:50,420
in Kenshia Hall, low-key, Kenshia Hall. What do you think of Kenshia Hall this year?

1247
01:36:50,420 --> 01:36:54,380
Kenshia Hall blew. It was a little weak compared to last year, and a lot of that

1248
01:36:54,380 --> 01:36:58,620
was because Game Infinity got promoted to West Hall. So Game Infinity wasn't

1249
01:36:58,620 --> 01:37:02,900
in Kenshia Hall this year. But there were some interesting things there.

1250
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:09,220
One exhibitor that was in Kenshia Hall was GetUpMove.com. They weren't

1251
01:37:09,220 --> 01:37:13,620
listed in the program as Red Octane, they were actually listed as GetUpMove.com.

1252
01:37:13,620 --> 01:37:14,620
This is the interesting thing.

1253
01:37:14,620 --> 01:37:17,460
We went by the booth a couple times because when you're at E3, you end up walking the

1254
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:18,460
floor several times.

1255
01:37:18,460 --> 01:37:20,740
You walk by the booths several times.

1256
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:26,580
When we went by the booth on Wednesday, all they had set up were the metal pads and no

1257
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:30,580
TVs and they had boxes for in the groove, display boxes.

1258
01:37:30,580 --> 01:37:36,620
They were kind of promoting in the groove but nothing to show.

1259
01:37:36,620 --> 01:37:38,660
So I was kind of like, well, that's kind of weird.

1260
01:37:38,660 --> 01:37:41,860
I was a little surprised. I was like, wouldn't you want to show off your game that's coming

1261
01:37:41,860 --> 01:37:46,680
out really soon? And I asked. I flat out asked the guy. I said, you know, I know there's

1262
01:37:46,680 --> 01:37:50,520
things that have happened in the past few weeks that possibly have delayed the home

1263
01:37:50,520 --> 01:37:54,460
release. What can you tell me about the release date of the home release? And he told me that

1264
01:37:54,460 --> 01:38:02,660
he could say it was pushed back a little bit, but mid-June is the target release now. And

1265
01:38:02,660 --> 01:38:06,500
he didn't say it was pushed back because of what was going on. In fact, the ref told me.

1266
01:38:06,500 --> 01:38:10,540
Yeah, if I were to guess, I would say it's probably not because of that.

1267
01:38:10,540 --> 01:38:14,380
It's probably because of the USB support that they were trying to fix.

1268
01:38:14,380 --> 01:38:16,460
That would be my guess.

1269
01:38:16,460 --> 01:38:17,460
I don't know.

1270
01:38:17,460 --> 01:38:20,860
I think the people are saying it's because of Sony's delay or something.

1271
01:38:20,860 --> 01:38:21,860
I don't know.

1272
01:38:21,860 --> 01:38:24,860
We don't really know what the delay is, but we don't think it's related to the lawsuit

1273
01:38:24,860 --> 01:38:28,340
anymore, which I guess I was proven wrong from last week.

1274
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,300
I was convinced that this was going to delay the home release, but hey, I was wrong.

1275
01:38:32,300 --> 01:38:33,300
But you know what?

1276
01:38:33,300 --> 01:38:37,240
said, I would love nothing more than to be proven wrong on it because I think the home

1277
01:38:37,240 --> 01:38:40,380
release should come out, so it looks like it's coming out.

1278
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:47,580
And from what the rep had told me, they are going ahead with it because they feel that

1279
01:38:47,580 --> 01:38:53,300
the lawsuit is more to do with the refitting of DDR arcade cabinets.

1280
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:57,180
Red Octane was named nowhere in that suit, so they are proceeding with the home release

1281
01:38:57,180 --> 01:39:01,180
because they feel that the lawsuit is strictly aimed at the arcade releases.

1282
01:39:01,180 --> 01:39:07,380
so they're gonna release this sucker in mid-June. My advice? If you want this game, buy it

1283
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:10,720
as soon as it comes out. If you don't want this game, don't buy it. But if you want this

1284
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:14,980
game, buy it as soon as it comes out. And I think you should at least check it out.

1285
01:39:14,980 --> 01:39:18,500
You know, it's different. Loki, you got to check it out for the first time. What'd you

1286
01:39:18,500 --> 01:39:19,500
think?

1287
01:39:19,500 --> 01:39:26,860
Uh, well, it's everything I said it was. It's a damn ripoff of DDR, and it sucked. The end.

1288
01:39:26,860 --> 01:39:34,620
Really I played it it sucked the note charts sucked the music sucked the graphics sucked and even the pads

1289
01:39:34,620 --> 01:39:36,620
They played it on the brand new

1290
01:39:37,020 --> 01:39:41,780
You know metal pads by red octane sucked. They killed my ankles

1291
01:39:41,980 --> 01:39:49,060
It's the rubbery parts that were inset were inset too far and they were too rubbery and they actually there's no

1292
01:39:49,180 --> 01:39:53,920
It's good for sticking to the pad, but it's not good if you want to actually do any freestyling or stuff on it

1293
01:39:53,920 --> 01:40:10,920
I did not like their new pads, I thought they stunk, I would not spend my money on them, and I would not even touch nor play ever again in The Groove or in The Groove 2 or any sort of incarnation of In The Groove. It sucked ass and I do not support it at all.

1294
01:40:12,920 --> 01:40:14,920
Now tell us how you really feel.

1295
01:40:14,920 --> 01:40:21,920
Oh, okay. Here's how I really feel. I think that the interface is playing such as a stupid port of StepMania to the PlayStation 2.

1296
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:26,920
So all you people that want to play StepMania on the PlayStation 2, there you go. Here it is. Enjoy.

1297
01:40:26,920 --> 01:40:30,920
But as far as wanting original music, you're not going to find it in The Groove.

1298
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:35,920
In The Groove is just a bunch of rehashed, really amateurish music that you're going to find there.

1299
01:40:35,920 --> 01:40:38,920
Oh, sure. There's some good, you know, licensed songs in there. Good. Play those.

1300
01:40:38,920 --> 01:40:41,920
That's about all you're going to enjoy as far as In The Groove goes.

1301
01:40:41,920 --> 01:40:46,920
But hey if you want the you know something harder for you there you go enjoy that but guess what you're gonna have to shell

1302
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:50,760
out money for a nice metal pad in order to play those hard songs because guess what a

1303
01:40:51,040 --> 01:40:52,740
Soft pad ain't gonna do it for you

1304
01:40:52,740 --> 01:40:55,980
And you know what I don't think that those ignition pads are going to do it for you either

1305
01:40:55,980 --> 01:41:01,480
So have fun playing a game, but I'm sure that unless you are a hardcore in the groove player

1306
01:41:01,480 --> 01:41:03,480
You're gonna be disappointed with this so

1307
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:05,320
enjoy

1308
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:08,320
Wow, I was wondering when you were gonna rant this show I

1309
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:11,080
you know what I I

1310
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:15,080
Let me just put it this way, there's better music games coming out this year, don't waste your money.

1311
01:41:15,080 --> 01:41:17,080
I didn't have the...

1312
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:22,080
When I first played In the Groove, I wasn't like, OMG this is the best thing ever,

1313
01:41:22,080 --> 01:41:25,080
but I wasn't like anti-In the Groove like you were.

1314
01:41:25,080 --> 01:41:32,080
It just grew on me, I think you should give it another chance, because In the Groove, it grew on me, as I played it more and more.

1315
01:41:32,080 --> 01:41:38,080
I'm sorry though, but these people are going, oh it's not DDR! No, it is DDR, it's exactly DDR.

1316
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:44,960
I, I can't argue with you there. It's, it's, it's very, very much DDR. But, um, the dance

1317
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:50,680
pads, I completely disagree. I think the afterburners are great. I loved playing on them. I don't,

1318
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:53,600
that's where I don't get it. Because I thought they were great.

1319
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:57,480
Okay, the afterburners are okay pads. They just have a fatal flaw in it, and that's that

1320
01:41:57,480 --> 01:42:01,520
they're inset too far. Raise them up just a few millimeters and you'll be perfect. They'll

1321
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:07,040
be a great pad. It's just right now, they're too far, so you're gonna, you're playing on

1322
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:11,360
it's awkward because they're inset too far, and that's why. I didn't like them. I played

1323
01:42:11,360 --> 01:42:15,560
on a lot of different hardpads. There's, trust me, there are pads worse than the afterburners

1324
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:20,520
there, and we played on those right afterwards. Yeah, now, now, you, even though you're knocking

1325
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:25,560
on the afterburners, what happened after you left Red Octane's booth? You went to DDR Games

1326
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:30,640
booth, and you played on that metal pad, which has a bar, by the way, so this would be great

1327
01:42:30,640 --> 01:42:34,640
for you and the Groove players, except... Except the thing is flat, and you can't tell

1328
01:42:34,640 --> 01:42:38,440
where you are. It's soft pad syndrome. You basically float all over the pad and you miss

1329
01:42:38,440 --> 01:42:42,440
stuff. Not only that, but it wasn't very sensitive at all. That's the other thing I didn't like

1330
01:42:42,440 --> 01:42:46,120
about the afterburner. It didn't seem sensitive at all. Now, I was testing it to see...

1331
01:42:46,120 --> 01:42:49,760
Is it maybe, is it maybe just that the afterburner was worn out from all the people playing on

1332
01:42:49,760 --> 01:42:56,120
it? It's possible... When I played at the premiere, I thought the pads were pristine.

1333
01:42:56,120 --> 01:43:00,640
I thought they were awesome pads. My, my complaints with it would be that one, the arrows are

1334
01:43:00,640 --> 01:43:04,200
rubbery. They should be just like a metal type thing. Because honestly, if you're playing

1335
01:43:04,200 --> 01:43:08,200
shoes you're still gonna get grip but if you want to actually slide on them you

1336
01:43:08,200 --> 01:43:13,680
can actually do that as well they that I think would be beneficial for them the

1337
01:43:13,680 --> 01:43:17,600
reason why it that the rubbery is that you stick too much and so it kills your

1338
01:43:17,600 --> 01:43:21,440
ankles when you do that because it's just not quite like plexiglass and you

1339
01:43:21,440 --> 01:43:25,800
get the same syndrome if you like play on some a pad that's sticky the same

1340
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:29,400
thing and this goes for the arcade mixes you'll get the same problem because it

1341
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:34,000
sticks too much and it doesn't you know give as much as you would on a normal

1342
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:44,000
Alright, we're going to talk about the other dance pads that we saw in Kenshiya Hall in a little bit, but I'm going to actually just shift gears real quick here, because we actually have a special guest on our Skype line right now. Who is this?

1343
01:43:44,000 --> 01:43:46,000
Just my ass.

1344
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,000
Hello, Dark Sakura, how are you?

1345
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:51,000
Exhausted.

1346
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:52,000
Yeah?

1347
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:53,000
Tired.

1348
01:43:53,000 --> 01:43:54,000
Been in the car all day.

1349
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,000
Yeah, I know how that feels. It kind of sucks driving in the car all day long. How was Disneyland?

1350
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:05,040
Disneyland was pretty fun. They turned off the fast pass at Roger Rabbit though, that

1351
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:09,080
kind of made me upset. But other than that, it went on Indiana Jones twice.

1352
01:44:09,080 --> 01:44:11,920
Very cool. What was the best ride you rode while you were there?

1353
01:44:11,920 --> 01:44:16,300
Indiana Jones, without a doubt. Heck yeah. So we've been talking about E3

1354
01:44:16,300 --> 01:44:20,800
tonight. Of course, obviously, that's what this show's been about. What were your impressions?

1355
01:44:20,800 --> 01:44:25,200
Oh, we went to Timbuktu. What were your impressions of some of the stuff

1356
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:30,280
at E3. We've talked about Beatmania and the Konami DDRs and we were moving into In the

1357
01:44:30,280 --> 01:44:32,760
Groove. What were your thoughts on some of those games?

1358
01:44:32,760 --> 01:44:37,320
Beatmania, of course, was great. Actually, can you believe I got my first AAA on the

1359
01:44:37,320 --> 01:44:42,160
stage in front of like a bajillion people? Hey, good deal.

1360
01:44:42,160 --> 01:44:49,500
As far as the other stuff, of course, Katamari Damacy was cool. Call of Cthulhu was really

1361
01:44:49,500 --> 01:44:55,420
freaking awesome. And I got to play Popocalist, which is a new...Adject got the license on

1362
01:44:55,420 --> 01:45:03,060
that one, and they announced it at E3, and it was pretty awesome. It's a 2D RPG game.

1363
01:45:03,060 --> 01:45:06,860
For anyone who's into the import scene or into anime, they probably are very familiar

1364
01:45:06,860 --> 01:45:11,940
with this one, since it's very, very big. But I got to play a PSP debug, too. They're

1365
01:45:11,940 --> 01:45:12,940
pretty heavy.

1366
01:45:12,940 --> 01:45:16,140
All right. Now, by the way, I just want to add, for those of you guys listening at home

1367
01:45:16,140 --> 01:45:20,480
right now. If you hear Jamie breaking up a little bit, don't adjust your speakers. It's

1368
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:24,240
just we're having a little issue with Skype. But we can still understand you, Jamie. It's

1369
01:45:24,240 --> 01:45:28,360
just there's some weird skips in your voice. I don't know what's going on. Just Skype.

1370
01:45:28,360 --> 01:45:33,360
I actually turned off the show. Oh, maybe that'll help. Okay. No, I already did. Oh,

1371
01:45:33,360 --> 01:45:40,160
hmm. Alright, well. I already did. We'll see. What about the dance games coming out? DDR

1372
01:45:40,160 --> 01:45:45,160
Xtreme Mix 3, Xtreme 2, DDR Mario Mix.

1373
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:49,160
Well, I looked at the game, actually I focused on the Mario one in particular.

1374
01:45:49,160 --> 01:45:52,160
I took a bunch of pictures, they'll be up on the site soon.

1375
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:59,160
But as far as the other, I really didn't get to play them because of the injury to my hip from my car accident.

1376
01:45:59,160 --> 01:46:03,160
I tried to play and it just ended up hurting way too badly.

1377
01:46:03,160 --> 01:46:06,160
Although I do like the new mix of Jelly Kiss, that was pretty cool.

1378
01:46:06,160 --> 01:46:09,160
We actually played Loki's bootleg earlier.

1379
01:46:09,160 --> 01:46:10,160
It wasn't so bad.

1380
01:46:10,160 --> 01:46:11,160
Did you say Loki's booty?

1381
01:46:11,160 --> 01:46:12,160
No.

1382
01:46:12,160 --> 01:46:13,160
Loki's bootleg.

1383
01:46:13,160 --> 01:46:14,800
Oh.

1384
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:15,800
We did not play my ass.

1385
01:46:15,800 --> 01:46:17,400
It broke up and it sounded like booty.

1386
01:46:17,400 --> 01:46:20,840
No, we did not play Loki's booty.

1387
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:23,420
What did you think of, now did you go down to Kenshi Hall?

1388
01:46:23,420 --> 01:46:26,480
We were just talking about some of the stuff we saw in Kenshi Hall.

1389
01:46:26,480 --> 01:46:27,480
Yeah.

1390
01:46:27,480 --> 01:46:28,480
Red Octane's.

1391
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:31,360
The Red Octane's paths were ass-worthy.

1392
01:46:31,360 --> 01:46:33,000
I played on the DDR game.

1393
01:46:33,000 --> 01:46:34,000
Ha!

1394
01:46:34,000 --> 01:46:35,000
I don't get this.

1395
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:36,000
I out-voted here.

1396
01:46:36,000 --> 01:46:37,960
I thought the After Burner paths were awesome.

1397
01:46:37,960 --> 01:46:44,960
You know what? If they wanted to do a good pad, then Konami needs to re-release the DX pad for the U.S.

1398
01:46:44,960 --> 01:46:52,960
Apart from that, I have not played on a single metal pad, other than ones that are homemade that have withstood my, you know, exacting standards.

1399
01:46:52,960 --> 01:46:56,960
I don't get it. You know what? I didn't play on the E3 metal pad, I don't think.

1400
01:46:56,960 --> 01:47:02,960
The DDR game ones were better, and those were injury-inflicting, as I'm sure Iguana Girl's foot will demonstrate.

1401
01:47:02,960 --> 01:47:06,960
I totally have to disagree there. I thought those DDR game ones were kind of booty.

1402
01:47:06,960 --> 01:47:13,040
But there was a delay on them. All right. All right, and they are very easy to injure yourself on

1403
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:16,800
I think it's ironic though that the DER game ones are the one that have the bar

1404
01:47:17,160 --> 01:47:21,560
When red octane ought to be putting a bar on their pads if they're releasing in the groove, don't you think?

1405
01:47:22,280 --> 01:47:27,920
Well, you know what the bar shouldn't be included at all because that just encourages people to rape it

1406
01:47:27,920 --> 01:47:32,520
Oh, yeah, that's the other thing. I hate them making a flood of the bar. Okay, I

1407
01:47:32,520 --> 01:47:40,180
Going back, I don't want to start another bar issue on the show, but I still say if

1408
01:47:40,180 --> 01:47:44,200
the bar wasn't something that should have been used, then they wouldn't have put it

1409
01:47:44,200 --> 01:47:45,200
on the thing.

1410
01:47:45,200 --> 01:47:47,400
So, I'm okay with people bar reading.

1411
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:51,200
Well, yeah, but that goes to the same people who complain about using speed modifiers on

1412
01:47:51,200 --> 01:47:52,200
DDR.

1413
01:47:52,200 --> 01:47:54,200
If they didn't want it used, they wouldn't have put it in the damn game.

1414
01:47:54,200 --> 01:47:55,200
Right.

1415
01:47:55,200 --> 01:47:59,560
Of course, many people say, well, you know, oh, it shouldn't be there, blah, blah, blah.

1416
01:47:59,560 --> 01:48:04,080
use your speed modifiers in 2DX, as well as using them in DDR.

1417
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:08,120
Right, and what's wrong with using the bar? Because the bar's there.

1418
01:48:08,120 --> 01:48:12,200
Because it's a cop-out, it means you're weak.

1419
01:48:12,200 --> 01:48:13,880
I disagree, but that's fine.

1420
01:48:13,880 --> 01:48:20,000
You are weak and you rely on the bar for your support. You should stand on your own feet and

1421
01:48:20,000 --> 01:48:22,440
beat the game yourself.

1422
01:48:22,440 --> 01:48:26,380
Any other E3? How was your week? How was your day outside of E3?

1423
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:28,620
I got sunburned.

1424
01:48:28,620 --> 01:48:33,460
at Disneyland? I put some like everywhere except I forgot that my neckline

1425
01:48:33,460 --> 01:48:37,340
with that shirt is just a little bit lower than I was thinking of because

1426
01:48:37,340 --> 01:48:41,540
I have this really cool shirt but it sags just a little bit because it's just enough too big

1427
01:48:41,540 --> 01:48:45,940
and so I didn't put any on my neckline and I was, my shoulder was getting sore and I

1428
01:48:45,940 --> 01:48:46,780
thought it was from

1429
01:48:46,780 --> 01:48:49,980
the shoulder strap on the camera rubbing up against my

1430
01:48:49,980 --> 01:48:54,140
skin. Turned out I was sunburned and it's actually a little swollen.

1431
01:48:54,140 --> 01:49:01,140
Did you do anything else in LA besides Disneyland and E3?

1432
01:49:01,140 --> 01:49:08,140
We went to AI. I played lots of pop music, you know, huh?

1433
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:13,140
Actually, I just played all the Goonies and all the anime stuff.

1434
01:49:13,140 --> 01:49:17,140
I thought Iroha was a little overrated, but that's just me.

1435
01:49:17,140 --> 01:49:28,640
I played Beatmania 3's 7th final deal, just because I was waiting for Edo hot and it was

1436
01:49:28,640 --> 01:49:33,920
really hard to hear and it wasn't all that much fun.

1437
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,540
We went to Roscoe's house for chicken and waffles on Wednesday and I had been really

1438
01:49:38,540 --> 01:49:43,420
good on my eating all day because I was going to have some grits and country gravy.

1439
01:49:43,420 --> 01:49:45,420
Believe it or not, the grits were substandard.

1440
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:52,420
Not good grits. However, the chicken livers were pretty awesome, and so was the chicken gravy.

1441
01:49:52,420 --> 01:49:59,420
I had fried chicken liver. Say what you will, fried chicken liver's good. It's like my comfort food.

1442
01:49:59,420 --> 01:50:03,420
I don't know. I don't think I'm brave enough to try one, but maybe someday.

1443
01:50:03,420 --> 01:50:04,420
I used to eat the livers all the time.

1444
01:50:04,420 --> 01:50:05,420
Then we went to karaoke.

1445
01:50:05,420 --> 01:50:07,420
Did you sing anything at karaoke?

1446
01:50:07,420 --> 01:50:09,420
I actually did, believe it or not.

1447
01:50:09,420 --> 01:50:12,480
They had a that you could choose Chinese

1448
01:50:13,640 --> 01:50:15,080
Indonesian

1449
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:17,080
Japanese Korean and

1450
01:50:17,520 --> 01:50:23,080
English songs and I actually went on the Japanese list and found the opening Tulane on the

1451
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:28,380
Japanese list there was a bunch of other songs that sort of half new in Japanese, but this one was all in English

1452
01:50:28,380 --> 01:50:29,580
So I sang it

1453
01:50:29,580 --> 01:50:33,620
Hmm if it was if it was at the place on Thursday, I would sing that one but

1454
01:50:33,620 --> 01:50:40,620
Anything else you want to share about E3? Things you saw at E3? Stuff you want to share with our listeners?

1455
01:50:40,620 --> 01:50:48,620
I saw the PS3 demo and the Xbox 360 demo and I took a bajillion pictures of the PlayStation 3.

1456
01:50:48,620 --> 01:50:55,620
The demos were pretty cool. There's like a motocross game that had a pretty excellent demo to it.

1457
01:50:55,620 --> 01:51:02,620
They did a demonstration for the new Tekken thing with Jin and he was all sweaty and I was like, ooh, sweaty Jin.

1458
01:51:02,620 --> 01:51:04,620
Yeah, pictures of that online.

1459
01:51:04,620 --> 01:51:06,620
I played the crap out of Nintendogs.

1460
01:51:06,620 --> 01:51:08,620
I played Frisbee with the puppies.

1461
01:51:08,620 --> 01:51:10,620
They have Sweaty Gin online.

1462
01:51:10,620 --> 01:51:12,620
Huh?

1463
01:51:12,620 --> 01:51:14,620
A picture of Sweaty Gin online.

1464
01:51:14,620 --> 01:51:16,620
Oooh.

1465
01:51:16,620 --> 01:51:20,620
It's on IGN and it's super big so you can see all the sweat and pores and everything.

1466
01:51:20,620 --> 01:51:22,620
Oh, hooray.

1467
01:51:22,620 --> 01:51:24,620
Are you on the site yet? Do you know?

1468
01:51:24,620 --> 01:51:28,620
I haven't checked. I've been home for all of two and a half hours.

1469
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:30,620
Oh, we'll have to check some of that out and let us know.

1470
01:51:30,620 --> 01:51:37,620
It was long enough for me to post my picture, which I'm going to link in the chatroom, of the Reject False Icon sticker on Pac-Man's mouth.

1471
01:51:37,620 --> 01:51:38,620
Okay.

1472
01:51:40,620 --> 01:51:42,620
I put lots of stuff on the Katamari.

1473
01:51:43,620 --> 01:51:49,620
Yeah, I actually ended up putting that sticker on because you put all this other stuff on there. You were like, you didn't want to keep doing it.

1474
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:54,620
I ended up getting four mouse pads, and I gave one to Iguana Girl because she didn't get one.

1475
01:51:54,620 --> 01:52:03,620
I gave one to Julie because she was nice and babysat my big fat cat, and I kept two for myself. I'm going to take one to work.

1476
01:52:03,620 --> 01:52:13,620
Oh, I actually managed to snag three, and I am going to give one to somebody, but the other one I'm actually going to give away on the show at a later date.

1477
01:52:13,620 --> 01:52:19,620
Well, I've still got stuff to add to the bag of swag. You haven't mentioned that to our listeners.

1478
01:52:19,620 --> 01:52:21,620
I haven't. Why don't you go ahead and tell them.

1479
01:52:21,620 --> 01:52:25,620
tell them. Well, we're planning on doing a contest. We're not really sure how we're

1480
01:52:25,620 --> 01:52:30,200
gonna make you embarrass yourselves for stuff, but you know a lot of this swag is

1481
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,860
going for bucks on eBay. I found out the slimes are going for $40 apiece. The what

1482
01:52:34,860 --> 01:52:38,860
is going for $40? The slimes that they were giving out at the square picture

1483
01:52:38,860 --> 01:52:44,380
thing. Oh my gosh. Really? Yeah, you can like just order them from Japan for like five bucks. I'm gonna sell mine now.

1484
01:52:44,380 --> 01:52:49,780
How much are those BeatMania t-shirts going for? Oh, I'll tell you what, we've got

1485
01:52:49,780 --> 01:52:53,780
I got Julie over here on eBay right now. Do you see any of the BeatMania t-shirts up there?

1486
01:52:53,780 --> 01:52:55,780
Let me take a look here.

1487
01:52:55,780 --> 01:52:57,780
She's actually found one.

1488
01:52:57,780 --> 01:52:59,780
Let me see how much it is on eBay.

1489
01:52:59,780 --> 01:53:02,780
Yeah, like I'm ever going to give mine to anybody.

1490
01:53:02,780 --> 01:53:13,780
I know. I had people giving me pouty faces and puppy dog eyes for my BeatMania shirt and I said this is the one thing I'm keeping for myself.

1491
01:53:13,780 --> 01:53:17,780
Now, I got yelled at for getting a Karaoke Revolution shirt for somebody else

1492
01:53:17,780 --> 01:53:20,500
because I had this total bitch yell at me saying,

1493
01:53:20,500 --> 01:53:22,580
you dug your claws into me to get that shirt out of there,

1494
01:53:22,580 --> 01:53:23,460
you'd start me with your nails.

1495
01:53:23,460 --> 01:53:24,380
I didn't even touch her.

1496
01:53:24,380 --> 01:53:25,840
I don't know what the hell she was smoking.

1497
01:53:25,840 --> 01:53:27,780
And then her boyfriend called me an asshole.

1498
01:53:27,780 --> 01:53:29,580
And I didn't appreciate that because I'm

1499
01:53:29,580 --> 01:53:30,880
trying to do something nice for someone else,

1500
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,820
because I ended up giving that t-shirt to somebody else.

1501
01:53:33,820 --> 01:53:34,460
People suck.

1502
01:53:34,460 --> 01:53:35,100
I hate them.

1503
01:53:35,100 --> 01:53:37,860
The DS trailer for Twilight Princess

1504
01:53:37,860 --> 01:53:39,980
is going for $76 right now.

1505
01:53:39,980 --> 01:53:41,020
Oh my gosh.

1506
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:43,060
Yeah, if you've got a press kit from Nintendo,

1507
01:53:43,060 --> 01:53:45,140
they actually have a DS cartridge with a Zelda trailer

1508
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:45,660
on it.

1509
01:53:45,660 --> 01:53:49,660
The Metal Gear Solid, um, ooh, what is this?

1510
01:53:49,660 --> 01:53:54,660
Um, we're still looking for this shirt. Someone put their stupid Tylenol Ouch shirt on.

1511
01:53:54,660 --> 01:53:55,660
Okay, you know those...

1512
01:53:55,660 --> 01:53:58,660
We're giving out free massages at the Tylenol Ouch booth.

1513
01:53:58,660 --> 01:53:59,660
Right.

1514
01:53:59,660 --> 01:54:01,660
I had a really cute, uh, cute mess over here.

1515
01:54:01,660 --> 01:54:05,660
You know those, those, um, glossy things that they were giving out for free at Konami's booth?

1516
01:54:05,660 --> 01:54:10,660
Uh, Metal Gear Solid 4, those are going for $10 a piece.

1517
01:54:10,660 --> 01:54:12,660
I got two of those.

1518
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:13,660
I have two of those as well.

1519
01:54:13,660 --> 01:54:14,660
Maybe we should put one on eBay.

1520
01:54:14,660 --> 01:54:18,700
Or maybe we should put one in the bag. Yes, we're gonna give away a bag of swag

1521
01:54:18,700 --> 01:54:21,860
Which it could end up being be worth hundreds of dollars

1522
01:54:22,380 --> 01:54:26,680
By the time we don't want the promo. We love caught the Mario mouse pad five dollars

1523
01:54:28,140 --> 01:54:31,720
Wow, yes stylus for Mario Kart ten dollars

1524
01:54:31,720 --> 01:54:35,420
I will try to get a picture of the beat mania sure a little later. Basically all it is

1525
01:54:36,180 --> 01:54:42,820
I'll tell you what. I have mine still rolled up. I took a picture of it in the bag. Uh-huh, and I'll try to

1526
01:54:42,820 --> 01:54:47,380
to resize and put that picture up and post it in the chat room before we go.

1527
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:51,060
Good. We're going to dinner and going to see episode 3. That's cool. So yeah, some

1528
01:54:51,060 --> 01:54:54,140
folks in the chat room want to see that BeatMania shirt. It's basically a black

1529
01:54:54,140 --> 01:54:58,220
shirt with the orange BeatMania logo. It's nothing like super special, but... It has a

1530
01:54:58,220 --> 01:55:02,020
little Konami one in the front over like where your heart would be. It's a freaking BeatMania shirt.

1531
01:55:02,020 --> 01:55:12,260
If I had one. It's a freaking BeatMania shirt. What more do you need? In the USA. It looks really cool. It was really cool. But now, as soon as we find a way, you know, a way to

1532
01:55:12,260 --> 01:55:16,140
to properly embarrass our listeners to get swag.

1533
01:55:16,140 --> 01:55:20,340
We are compiling a bag of swag for you guys, and we will

1534
01:55:20,340 --> 01:55:22,300
send that to whoever the lucky winner is.

1535
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:25,060
You don't have to go on eBay like some people do, because

1536
01:55:25,060 --> 01:55:27,940
I'm laughing at whoever's bidding on some of this crap,

1537
01:55:27,940 --> 01:55:30,100
although I'm sort of getting ideas now to take

1538
01:55:30,100 --> 01:55:32,660
advantage of it.

1539
01:55:32,660 --> 01:55:35,940
And according to Julie, hardly any of it's being bid on.

1540
01:55:35,940 --> 01:55:40,820
Yeah, I think people are expecting more from eBay than

1541
01:55:40,820 --> 01:55:41,740
they're actually going to get.

1542
01:55:41,740 --> 01:55:59,740
You know, I went off earlier and people said in the chatroom I was actually sounding like you because I was just, I went off for a few minutes on Konami supporting their US audience and what they did at E3 really shows that they support their US audience by bringing in the Grooveloos and stuff.

1543
01:55:59,740 --> 01:56:03,740
I was going to ask, what was your opinion on the Grooveloos and what they were doing?

1544
01:56:03,740 --> 01:56:06,740
I thought that they were cool and one of them was on Roundhouse.

1545
01:56:06,740 --> 01:56:10,740
He wasn't actually dancing though, he was the MC guy.

1546
01:56:10,740 --> 01:56:12,740
Yeah. Well, I remembered him.

1547
01:56:12,740 --> 01:56:13,740
Yeah.

1548
01:56:13,740 --> 01:56:19,740
I remembered, you know, once it was mentioned to me, I was like, oh yeah, that is him, isn't it?

1549
01:56:19,740 --> 01:56:23,740
But no, I was really impressed with them. They were great.

1550
01:56:23,740 --> 01:56:29,740
You know, and it was just even, you know, and there were people, you know, you know, one of them won the giveaway.

1551
01:56:29,740 --> 01:56:30,740
Yeah.

1552
01:56:30,740 --> 01:56:36,740
And there were people complaining. I actually came back and heard about that later, about them complaining about them winning.

1553
01:56:36,740 --> 01:56:42,740
They don't work for Konami, they were employed by Konami simply for E3.

1554
01:56:42,740 --> 01:56:49,740
You know that they actually ended up, the powers that be at Konami, ended up vetoing that win and somebody else walked away with it.

1555
01:56:49,740 --> 01:56:51,740
Oh, that's really crappy.

1556
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:55,740
Which, by the way, the most unenthusiastic winners ever, by the way.

1557
01:56:55,740 --> 01:56:59,740
Konami, not only did they bring in the Groovles, we forgot to completely mention this,

1558
01:56:59,740 --> 01:57:05,260
they actually gave away every day a 30-inch high-definition television set,

1559
01:57:05,260 --> 01:57:08,500
all of their revolution games, and

1560
01:57:08,500 --> 01:57:12,040
what else was it? It was a DVD? No, it was a sound system.

1561
01:57:12,040 --> 01:57:16,020
A Logitech, super nice surround sound system. Every day they gave one of these away.

1562
01:57:16,020 --> 01:57:20,180
Two of the most unenthusiastic winners I've ever seen in my life.

1563
01:57:20,180 --> 01:57:24,980
Oh, I found my pictures of the Cybersex game. But this is just another example about how Konami

1564
01:57:24,980 --> 01:57:28,820
supports their US audience because they gave away thousands of dollars in prizes

1565
01:57:28,820 --> 01:57:39,220
promote DDR. All right. There's a 360 faceplate that someone got and that's

1566
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:43,580
going for $100 on eBay right now. Yeah I heard about that, the 360 faceplate.

1567
01:57:43,580 --> 01:57:50,060
Micro erasers are going for money too. I saw those. Anything else you want to

1568
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:59,060
share with us Dark Sakura? Really, haha, I got to go to E3. No seriously, it was really

1569
01:57:59,060 --> 01:58:05,340
good. I got very worn out walking all over the place. Now I'm sunburned from Disneyland.

1570
01:58:05,340 --> 01:58:10,020
But in about two minutes, you guys should be able to check out the picture of the Beat

1571
01:58:10,020 --> 01:58:15,340
Mania shirt in my swag bag. Somebody posted somebody else at the show wearing one, but

1572
01:58:15,340 --> 01:58:18,860
go ahead and post your picture anyway. Give them a nice chance to. Mine's actually the

1573
01:58:18,860 --> 01:58:23,700
rolled up one also my free copy of the magic the gathering uh...

1574
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:25,600
online uh... card game

1575
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:26,880
okay

1576
01:58:26,880 --> 01:58:31,620
and the way that i'll be talking and uh... academy mouse

1577
01:58:31,620 --> 01:58:36,120
and actually i don't have i gave away my spare stylus and so he's got an

1578
01:58:36,120 --> 01:58:37,700
extra something

1579
01:58:37,700 --> 01:58:38,720
uh...

1580
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:42,640
but we've got we've got some stuff that we can throw in the bag and uh...

1581
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:47,420
i did by the way check the nintendo uh... press kit which i did get a copy of

1582
01:58:47,420 --> 01:58:50,180
There's actually autographed stickers in there by Miyamoto.

1583
01:58:50,180 --> 01:58:50,680
Oh, cool.

1584
01:58:50,680 --> 01:58:52,940
Were you able to look up, if you have a Nintendo press kit,

1585
01:58:52,940 --> 01:58:54,940
I don't know if you have any information on DDR Mario Mix.

1586
01:58:54,940 --> 01:58:55,020
I looked at the tape.

1587
01:58:55,020 --> 01:58:55,780
The tape's not there.

1588
01:58:55,780 --> 01:58:56,740
Oh, for Mario Mix?

1589
01:58:56,740 --> 01:58:57,240
No.

1590
01:58:57,240 --> 01:59:00,660
And though I have it right here, let me get to that page one more time.

1591
01:59:00,660 --> 01:59:02,900
It was really fast.

1592
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:04,220
It got a large page.

1593
01:59:04,220 --> 01:59:07,020
Donkey Konga 2.

1594
01:59:07,020 --> 01:59:07,860
Hey, here we go.

1595
01:59:07,860 --> 01:59:08,740
Read you what it says.

1596
01:59:08,740 --> 01:59:10,060
I played Donkey Konga 2.

1597
01:59:10,060 --> 01:59:11,980
You know what song I played in Donkey Konga 2?

1598
01:59:11,980 --> 01:59:14,820
Headstrong, which is some rock song.

1599
01:59:14,820 --> 01:59:17,100
I was like, what the hell is this doing in Donkey Konga?

1600
01:59:17,100 --> 01:59:18,340
but it was cool, whatever.

1601
01:59:18,340 --> 01:59:21,220
Well, let me read the little blurb on here, okay?

1602
01:59:21,220 --> 01:59:22,060
Okay.

1603
01:59:22,060 --> 01:59:23,740
Mario must recover the stolen music keys

1604
01:59:23,740 --> 01:59:25,480
before the unstable power of music

1605
01:59:25,480 --> 01:59:27,740
destroys the entire Mushroom Kingdom.

1606
01:59:27,740 --> 01:59:30,660
Shake your thing to over 25 dance flavored songs

1607
01:59:30,660 --> 01:59:33,540
from classic Nintendo themes to familiar favorites

1608
01:59:33,540 --> 01:59:35,260
and recover the missing keys.

1609
01:59:35,260 --> 01:59:37,860
With five difficulty levels, dancers of all abilities

1610
01:59:37,860 --> 01:59:39,060
can get into the groove.

1611
01:59:39,060 --> 01:59:40,460
The special workout feature tracks

1612
01:59:40,460 --> 01:59:42,560
the calories burn while playing, strut your moves

1613
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:44,240
and break a sweat to the beat.

1614
01:59:44,240 --> 01:59:45,080
No date.

1615
01:59:45,080 --> 01:59:45,920
Hmm, interesting.

1616
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:51,000
Do you remember being told sometime this fall? Yeah, I'm I'm almost positive. We're gonna see October November

1617
01:59:54,120 --> 02:00:00,240
I got to meet him. Oh, did you I thought I ran into him actually I was he does actually walking away from konami

1618
02:00:00,960 --> 02:00:02,520
I'm not gonna be able to get the picture

1619
02:00:02,520 --> 02:00:05,600
He says because we actually need to go because we get to eat before going to that's fine

1620
02:00:05,600 --> 02:00:11,620
All right, um, but I did get to meet him and I got to you know, I actually we were about to collide

1621
02:00:11,620 --> 02:00:17,800
So I said, you know saying I'm gonna sigh and he's really surprised and said thank you and have a good time

1622
02:00:18,440 --> 02:00:23,440
Awesome. Well, good job. You know, um, did you get chance to meet Togo? No, I didn't

1623
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:25,840
Oh, I I got a picture with Togo. He was cool

1624
02:00:26,600 --> 02:00:28,600
so

1625
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:34,560
All right, have fun

1626
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:40,560
Um, but, uh, I'm sorry I can't be at this show tonight. We only got back, I only got back later.

1627
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,560
Hey, I have one more thing to add, Jamie.

1628
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:43,560
Yeah.

1629
02:00:43,560 --> 02:00:51,560
Um, it was just announced today on, uh, PSP Hacker that someone's working on a PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

1630
02:00:51,560 --> 02:00:53,560
PC Engine emulator for the PSP.

1631
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:54,560
Yeah.

1632
02:00:54,560 --> 02:00:55,560
I've gotta see this.

1633
02:00:55,560 --> 02:01:01,560
I thought you'd like that. Alright. We're gonna let you go, uh, Jamie, but have fun at the movie, okay?

1634
02:01:01,560 --> 02:01:02,560
Alright, have a good time.

1635
02:01:02,560 --> 02:01:03,560
Alright, we'll see you next time.

1636
02:01:03,560 --> 02:01:05,560
Bye bye, we'll see you next week, right?

1637
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:07,560
We'll see you next week?

1638
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,560
Yep, and reject Pausegones.

1639
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,560
Alright, see ya! Bye.

1640
02:01:11,560 --> 02:01:17,560
Alright, that was DarkSakura, who's not here tonight, but she was able to bless us with her presents anyway.

1641
02:01:17,560 --> 02:01:19,560
One way or another.

1642
02:01:19,560 --> 02:01:23,560
Let's see, what we're going to do is we're going to take a break.

1643
02:01:23,560 --> 02:01:27,560
Karaoke Party we still have to talk about a little bit, because we haven't really...

1644
02:01:27,560 --> 02:01:30,560
Somebody in the chat room is asking about it right now, we never really did get to that.

1645
02:01:30,560 --> 02:01:35,560
So we'll talk about Karaoke Party. I want to talk about a new music game coming to your cell phone.

1646
02:01:35,560 --> 02:01:39,560
I hinted about this one earlier. It's a brand new music game coming to your cell phone.

1647
02:01:39,560 --> 02:01:42,560
I'll talk about that when we come back after a quick break.

1648
02:01:42,560 --> 02:01:44,560
So let's do that break.

1649
02:01:44,560 --> 02:01:50,560
And we'll start it off with In the Heat of the Night, which is going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

1650
02:01:50,560 --> 02:01:52,560
And we'll be back with more...

1651
02:01:52,560 --> 02:01:55,560
This is just going to be a potpourri break, I think.

1652
02:01:55,560 --> 02:02:00,560
And we'll be back with more Orange Lawns radio after this.

1653
02:02:00,560 --> 02:02:02,560
In the heat of the night

1654
02:02:07,560 --> 02:02:09,560
In the heat of the night

1655
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:20,560
Why did our feelings die in action

1656
02:02:20,560 --> 02:02:23,560
When we fought satisfaction

1657
02:02:23,560 --> 02:02:29,560
But our hearts and heads always saved me

1658
02:02:29,560 --> 02:02:34,560
Why? There's a love of all it's magic

1659
02:02:34,560 --> 02:02:38,560
It's a cute kind of tragic

1660
02:02:38,560 --> 02:02:42,560
We were here for the best

1661
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:46,560
In the heat of the night

1662
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:49,560
We're too close to the fire

1663
02:02:49,560 --> 02:02:53,560
And the power of our hearts

1664
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:56,560
Makes me cry inside

1665
02:02:56,560 --> 02:03:03,560
In the heat of the night, marching close to the fire

1666
02:03:03,560 --> 02:03:10,560
And the power of our hearts, made of me by desire

1667
02:03:10,560 --> 02:03:14,560
In the heat of the night

1668
02:03:17,560 --> 02:03:21,560
In the heat of the night

1669
02:03:21,560 --> 02:03:28,560
And the hate of the night

1670
02:03:28,560 --> 02:03:30,560
You

1671
02:03:58,560 --> 02:04:06,560
I want to save you all

1672
02:04:06,560 --> 02:04:09,560
Here, we can party

1673
02:04:09,560 --> 02:04:12,560
On those hills on me

1674
02:04:12,560 --> 02:04:15,560
I know you feel

1675
02:04:15,560 --> 02:04:19,560
Like a rainbow

1676
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:22,560
Needing bigger than you I

1677
02:04:22,560 --> 02:04:25,560
Needing better than I

1678
02:04:55,560 --> 02:05:02,560
And I don't know who you really make you hide

1679
02:05:02,560 --> 02:05:06,560
We're living under power

1680
02:05:32,560 --> 02:05:56,560
Let me be your fantasy, it's me, ecstasy

1681
02:07:56,560 --> 02:08:00,560
Floyd's snake, Floyd's snake, can you hear what I'm saying?

1682
02:08:00,560 --> 02:08:03,560
Well this time they took a man that wants to backtrack.

1683
02:08:03,560 --> 02:08:07,560
I'm gonna kick your ass, beat him, kill him all.

1684
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:13,560
Down, what am I gonna do?

1685
02:08:16,560 --> 02:08:19,560
Have you ever seen cool damn like this?

1686
02:08:19,560 --> 02:08:33,560
Orange Lounge Radio. We put your thing down, flip it and reverse it.

1687
02:08:33,560 --> 02:08:48,560
We are back and we are going to open up the Skype line you guys, so you guys can call in and talk to us and ask us questions and give us your feedback on what you think about the various releases of E3 as well.

1688
02:08:48,560 --> 02:08:54,560
So we're going to get to that. If you want more details on how you can be a part of that, www.orangelaunchradio.com

1689
02:08:54,560 --> 02:08:56,560
Click on interact with us.

1690
02:08:56,560 --> 02:09:05,560
But first, I want to give you guys a few notes on some other little game releases that they had at E3 on some other games that are coming out.

1691
02:09:05,560 --> 02:09:07,560
Guitar Hero.

1692
02:09:07,560 --> 02:09:12,560
Guitar Hero, they weren't showing anything at Red Octane's booth to the public.

1693
02:09:12,560 --> 02:09:16,560
And, in fact, when I asked about it, or when Loki asked about it, we kind of got the run-around

1694
02:09:16,560 --> 02:09:20,080
just saying, oh, well, we'll have more information out soon to the press, I can't say anything

1695
02:09:20,080 --> 02:09:21,080
right now, da-da-da.

1696
02:09:21,080 --> 02:09:25,640
Well, it turns out they're actually showing the game behind closed doors, and one of our

1697
02:09:25,640 --> 02:09:28,480
staffers got back there anyway, na-na-na-na-na.

1698
02:09:28,480 --> 02:09:30,520
So we can tell you about Guitar Hero.

1699
02:09:30,520 --> 02:09:32,960
Loki, I'll let you talk about this one.

1700
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,240
You're a big guitar fan.

1701
02:09:34,240 --> 02:09:38,060
Well, this game, it's very similar to Amplitude.

1702
02:09:38,060 --> 02:09:42,200
There's actually some wonderful screenshots online right now.

1703
02:09:42,200 --> 02:09:46,140
looks like amplitude. In the middle you've got all your stuff, it's kind of coming towards

1704
02:09:46,140 --> 02:09:50,140
you. I wouldn't say it's exactly like amplitude so much as it's amplitude and karaoke revolution

1705
02:09:50,140 --> 02:09:55,300
kind of combining with each other. Because you have to remember harmonics also helps

1706
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:59,200
with making karaoke revolution so it's kind of obvious that, you know. It's sort of like,

1707
02:09:59,200 --> 02:10:03,620
it's more like amplitude only because the stuff's coming towards you. It's that sort

1708
02:10:03,620 --> 02:10:08,200
of perspective. However, it is like karaoke revolution because on the side there's like

1709
02:10:08,200 --> 02:10:11,440
a meter that's, you know, kind of a crowd meter, very similar to

1710
02:10:11,440 --> 02:10:15,680
Karaoke Revolution, and basically it's five keys.

1711
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:20,320
However, depending on what difficulty you play, it's anywhere from three to five keys.

1712
02:10:20,320 --> 02:10:24,960
And I thought that was kind of cool. And now the songs that are going to be in it,

1713
02:10:24,960 --> 02:10:29,220
very similar to what Harmonics did before when they released Karaoke Revolution,

1714
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:33,820
they were actually doing covers of classic songs. They get these guys to go

1715
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:35,040
in the studio and re-record them.

1716
02:10:35,040 --> 02:11:04,960
Same deal for Guitar Hero, is what's going to happen. Same deal for Guitar Hero, except for the ones, obviously, that are, you know, that beaguitarhero.com. Right, beaguitarhero.com. If you have a friend who's in a band who might appreciate some exposure from being in this game, or you're one of these people, have them go check out the site, beaguitarhero.com. Now, considering how much you went off on Red Octane a little bit earlier, does this redeem them a little bit, you think? Well, I wasn't going off on Red Octane. I was going off on Rock Surf for the really crappy game. Red Octane, they're doing no bad.

1717
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,240
bad, because they're trying to actually distribute a dance game, which I give them credit for

1718
02:11:09,240 --> 02:11:12,440
that, because at least they're trying to do something. I wish they'd picked a better game,

1719
02:11:12,440 --> 02:11:18,080
but hey, when there's nothing else out there other than DDR, what are you going to do?

1720
02:11:18,080 --> 02:11:21,880
But as far as them actually distributing this game, this is actually a very good move for

1721
02:11:21,880 --> 02:11:26,500
them, because there are no other Guitar Freaks type games, and I think this will actually

1722
02:11:26,500 --> 02:11:31,520
exceed Guitar Freaks, which isn't that hard, since Guitar Freaks really hasn't changed

1723
02:11:31,520 --> 02:11:37,360
much since like Fifth Mix, so. But hey, it's more of a challenge, and there is the same

1724
02:11:37,360 --> 02:11:42,540
stuff in there that you would expect from Guitar Freaks, and it looks like they've actually

1725
02:11:42,540 --> 02:11:47,940
kind of got some hold notes in place, and from what I hear, the controller, even though

1726
02:11:47,940 --> 02:11:53,680
it has five key, it actually allows you to slide your hand along the different buttons

1727
02:11:53,680 --> 02:11:59,780
to be able to hit them easier, so it's actually like playing a guitar, which is nice. So,

1728
02:11:59,780 --> 02:12:09,780
But I managed to squeeze a little more information out of the guy when we were there asking him questions, all of course very vague answers.

1729
02:12:09,780 --> 02:12:16,780
I asked him if there was going to be a drum hero type game and they're all, we're working on something.

1730
02:12:16,780 --> 02:12:21,780
And also, so maybe a drum game coming soon?

1731
02:12:21,780 --> 02:12:22,780
Possibly.

1732
02:12:22,780 --> 02:12:24,780
Possibly.

1733
02:12:24,780 --> 02:12:31,780
So, that's something, and definitely there's some pretty cool shots, like I said, online,

1734
02:12:31,780 --> 02:12:33,780
and we'll probably have some more on our website soon enough.

1735
02:12:33,780 --> 02:12:36,780
We're hoping we can get some more exclusive shots for our website very soon, we'll see.

1736
02:12:36,780 --> 02:12:41,780
And we're going to have those probably, and it looks very similar to Karrick Revolution,

1737
02:12:41,780 --> 02:12:47,780
just like, because you've got the CG guy on stage, the crowd, very similar, so it'll be interesting.

1738
02:12:47,780 --> 02:12:52,780
Very interesting. Another game out there, Tycho Drummaster, you remember this game,

1739
02:12:52,780 --> 02:12:56,060
this game. It was actually shown for the first time at last year's E3.

1740
02:12:56,060 --> 02:13:00,300
Taiko Drum Master, of course, was released before Christmas last year.

1741
02:13:00,300 --> 02:13:05,140
So it's had some limited success. It's been doing pretty good, I think.

1742
02:13:05,140 --> 02:13:08,260
Folks enjoy it. It's kind of a different sort of music game title.

1743
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:12,580
Well now, Taiko Drum Master is available for your cell phone.

1744
02:13:12,580 --> 02:13:16,180
This is something that they were showing at E3. Namco actually has a lot of cell

1745
02:13:16,180 --> 02:13:17,700
phone games they're doing now,

1746
02:13:17,700 --> 02:13:21,380
and one of their series they're pushing is Arcade Classics.

1747
02:13:21,380 --> 02:13:25,420
The folks at NamcoCell were actually very nice to me and I've got to admit

1748
02:13:25,420 --> 02:13:28,500
you know and they didn't have to be nice me for me to say this but their cell

1749
02:13:28,500 --> 02:13:29,220
phone games

1750
02:13:29,220 --> 02:13:32,380
are pretty nice considering that they're cell phone games

1751
02:13:32,380 --> 02:13:35,600
I mean in the end they're still games on your cell phone

1752
02:13:35,600 --> 02:13:39,320
they're not gonna knock your socks off it's not going to be a Game Boy quality

1753
02:13:39,320 --> 02:13:39,840
game

1754
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:43,420
but for a cell phone game they're pretty cool. And in other news

1755
02:13:43,420 --> 02:13:46,460
the N-Gage arena, empty. Yeah

1756
02:13:46,460 --> 02:13:51,100
the sad thing is these Namco things running on Java on a cell phone

1757
02:13:51,100 --> 02:13:53,260
is better than anything I've seen on an N-Gage.

1758
02:13:53,260 --> 02:13:57,860
And I honestly, I did walk through the N-Gage booth, I checked it out.

1759
02:13:57,860 --> 02:14:00,980
They're releasing a new version of the N-Gage, N-Gage 2 I guess.

1760
02:14:00,980 --> 02:14:04,740
I played Civilization on N-Gage and couldn't figure out what the heck I was doing.

1761
02:14:04,740 --> 02:14:08,300
It's just, it's interesting.

1762
02:14:08,300 --> 02:14:13,300
I know there are other competitors out there that are not exactly N-Gage and not exactly

1763
02:14:13,300 --> 02:14:18,100
a Sony product that are portable, that are probably doing better than they are, so.

1764
02:14:18,100 --> 02:14:25,600
But hey, whatever, you know, they refuse to die, so at least let them, you know, try, but, yeah.

1765
02:14:25,600 --> 02:14:26,600
Interesting.

1766
02:14:26,600 --> 02:14:28,400
Um, so Tyco Drum Master, how's this work?

1767
02:14:28,400 --> 02:14:31,900
It looks like you actually used four and six to hit the different drums on your cell phone.

1768
02:14:31,900 --> 02:14:34,600
You used four and six with five being a drum roll.

1769
02:14:34,600 --> 02:14:36,200
We actually have a video of this game.

1770
02:14:36,200 --> 02:14:40,000
Unfortunately, it doesn't have any sound, but we will post the video to our website a little later.

1771
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:42,200
I'm going to do a little mini feature on this game.

1772
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:44,600
I don't think this is something that's going to appeal to everybody,

1773
02:14:44,600 --> 02:14:49,280
But you know for those you guys that have wanted a music game to take with you on your cell phone something to do with

1774
02:14:49,280 --> 02:14:56,000
Your board taiko drum master has a dozen songs from the original release now granted. It's a cell phone

1775
02:14:56,000 --> 02:15:01,840
so it's not gonna be the same quality, but still you know, it's something and it has the animation still and everything and

1776
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,940
Same types of rolls and combos and everything you remember for the original taiko drum master. This is available now

1777
02:15:08,160 --> 02:15:12,860
They're saying per their press release. It's available now. So check it out. See if your carrier has this

1778
02:15:12,860 --> 02:15:18,100
I imagine it's not available through all carriers, but I do know I'm a Sprint user myself and

1779
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:22,700
we do have Namco releases on our cell phone, so I believe this should be there, so I'm

1780
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:24,300
going to look for it.

1781
02:15:24,300 --> 02:15:33,180
I have AT&T, and I know they carry Namco stuff, however I'm not buying any of it because it's

1782
02:15:33,180 --> 02:15:36,100
way too damn expensive and they charge me like way too much money.

1783
02:15:36,100 --> 02:15:37,620
Aren't they only like five bucks for the game?

1784
02:15:37,620 --> 02:15:39,100
At least Sprint only charges like five bucks a game.

1785
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:40,820
Yeah, they're five dollars for the game.

1786
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:47,820
They don't charge you, they don't tell you that the download data was also included or not included with that.

1787
02:15:47,820 --> 02:15:56,820
Like for example, I downloaded a 300K picture that was on a website that I was looking for movie tickets on Fandango, thank you.

1788
02:15:56,820 --> 02:16:02,820
And the picture cost me $7. Thank you AT&T, I will never use your web feature again.

1789
02:16:02,820 --> 02:16:09,820
Someone in our chat room is saying that it's only on Verizon and available for a specific number of phones.

1790
02:16:09,820 --> 02:16:15,820
of phones. I didn't see anything in their release that indicated that, but I, the lady

1791
02:16:15,820 --> 02:16:20,220
at Namco was kind enough to give me her card, so I will write her and ask. Find out, because

1792
02:16:20,220 --> 02:16:22,780
maybe they're going to port it to others in the future, I don't know. I will write her

1793
02:16:22,780 --> 02:16:32,500
and find out. That's what I will do. Alright, let's see. What else do we have? What was

1794
02:16:32,500 --> 02:16:35,780
the other game I wanted to talk about? Karaoke Revolution Party. Did you look at this at

1795
02:16:35,780 --> 02:16:38,260
at all, Loki? I know you're a big Karaoke Revolution fan.

1796
02:16:38,260 --> 02:16:43,660
Oh yeah, don't you know me? I'm the huge karaoke fan. No, I stayed far, far, far, far away

1797
02:16:43,660 --> 02:16:50,260
from this game. Yes, far away. I did not touch this game. I did not look at this game. I

1798
02:16:50,260 --> 02:16:56,460
stayed far away like it was my kryptonite and I was Superman.

1799
02:16:56,460 --> 02:17:00,300
Well, what have you heard about Karaoke Revolution Party? Did you see the new sing and dance

1800
02:17:00,300 --> 02:17:02,180
mode where you can sing and dance at the same time?

1801
02:17:02,180 --> 02:17:05,420
Oh yeah, that'll be fun. Not only will I sound like an idiot,

1802
02:17:05,420 --> 02:17:10,020
I'll look like one too. Alright, well for those of you guys that actually enjoy

1803
02:17:10,020 --> 02:17:11,620
Karaoke Revolution, I

1804
02:17:11,620 --> 02:17:16,340
enjoy the game. You will now be able to sing and dance. Here's the crazy thing.

1805
02:17:16,340 --> 02:17:20,660
It's coming out on Xbox, PlayStation 2,

1806
02:17:20,660 --> 02:17:25,700
and GameCube. GameCube will be getting a Karaoke Revolution release for the first

1807
02:17:25,700 --> 02:17:27,300
time, so that was kind of a big news

1808
02:17:27,300 --> 02:17:31,100
right there. You will be able to get this on GameCube. A little bit unclear if the

1809
02:17:31,100 --> 02:17:34,380
Sing and Dance will be in the GameCube version, but they will get at least the

1810
02:17:34,380 --> 02:17:39,460
Sing part. I think they will get the Dance part as well, we'll see. Some of the

1811
02:17:39,460 --> 02:17:44,940
songs that were in it, the only ones I remember were Crazy in Love, Material

1812
02:17:44,940 --> 02:17:50,800
Girl was in it, because I actually did that one, Endless Love, Endless Love, Play

1813
02:17:50,800 --> 02:17:57,260
That Funky Music White Boy. The interface has changed, this is why they're not

1814
02:17:57,260 --> 02:17:59,980
calling it Karaoke Revolution 4, but they're actually calling it Karaoke

1815
02:17:59,980 --> 02:18:03,100
Revolution Party, because they actually went and did some remodeling to the interface.

1816
02:18:03,100 --> 02:18:07,140
There's now a create your own character mode in it as well, and of course the singing and

1817
02:18:07,140 --> 02:18:08,140
dancing.

1818
02:18:08,140 --> 02:18:11,560
So you can actually sing on easy and dance on hard.

1819
02:18:11,560 --> 02:18:15,520
About the hardest it gets is a seven-footer, but trust me, you guys, it is a lot harder

1820
02:18:15,520 --> 02:18:16,820
than it sounds.

1821
02:18:16,820 --> 02:18:19,780
Those of you guys that think you will be able to just do a seven-footer and sing at the

1822
02:18:19,780 --> 02:18:23,580
same time, it is not as easy as you would think.

1823
02:18:23,580 --> 02:18:24,580
It's going to be hard.

1824
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:28,740
Unless you really know the song, like, I know my material girl, okay?

1825
02:18:28,740 --> 02:18:31,500
So I was able to easily do the sing and dance mode because I

1826
02:18:31,500 --> 02:18:33,500
already know the lyrics and the melody and everything.

1827
02:18:33,500 --> 02:18:34,820
I didn't really need the bars.

1828
02:18:34,820 --> 02:18:37,700
Because the way the dance mode works, it doesn't look like

1829
02:18:37,700 --> 02:18:38,540
normal DDR.

1830
02:18:38,540 --> 02:18:41,860
If you've ever played Karaoke Revolution, the bars scroll

1831
02:18:41,860 --> 02:18:45,020
horizontally across the bottom of the screen, and then it

1832
02:18:45,020 --> 02:18:45,860
guides your pitch.

1833
02:18:45,860 --> 02:18:48,740
Well, the arrows show up, and they scroll horizontally at

1834
02:18:48,740 --> 02:18:50,140
the bottom of the screen as well.

1835
02:18:50,140 --> 02:18:53,220
So it's a little different.

1836
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:55,420
All right.

1837
02:18:55,420 --> 02:18:59,420
So, let's go ahead and open up the Skype line.

1838
02:18:59,420 --> 02:19:00,420
Okay.

1839
02:19:00,420 --> 02:19:01,420
Oh, maybe not just yet.

1840
02:19:01,420 --> 02:19:04,420
I just had a few other things I wanted to cover.

1841
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:08,420
It's not E3 related, but it is DDR related.

1842
02:19:08,420 --> 02:19:11,420
Dancing Stage Unleashed 2.

1843
02:19:11,420 --> 02:19:16,420
It was released recently, actually last week.

1844
02:19:16,420 --> 02:19:21,420
Basically, for those who don't know, that is the UK version of UltraMix 2.

1845
02:19:21,420 --> 02:19:37,420
And pretty much it's the same stuff that we had in UltraMix II, of course new licensed stuff, with stuff featuring like I See You Baby, which I have no idea what that is, Hot Stuff, Hip Teens Don't Wear Blue Jeans.

1846
02:19:37,420 --> 02:19:43,420
Is that that I See You Baby, Shakin' That Ass, isn't that song? I bet it's that song.

1847
02:19:43,420 --> 02:19:51,620
is that song, A Talent Called Malice, Circles, Get It On, and Hanging on the Telephone, which

1848
02:19:51,620 --> 02:19:55,920
is very interesting enough.

1849
02:19:55,920 --> 02:20:04,620
We actually do have, well, DDRUK being the ones that are on top of the ripping of different

1850
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:07,340
like stuff for the Sims scene.

1851
02:20:07,340 --> 02:20:10,500
So all the official stuff, we're already out for that, even though it was released like

1852
02:20:10,500 --> 02:20:12,800
the other week.

1853
02:20:12,800 --> 02:20:16,800
So, we'll have some of that stuff to play for you guys pretty soon.

1854
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:21,800
And I See You Baby is the one you think it is, and it's a Fat Boy Slim radio edit.

1855
02:20:21,800 --> 02:20:23,800
That's going to be pretty interesting.

1856
02:20:23,800 --> 02:20:27,800
But yeah, we'll have some of those songs available for you pretty soon, actually.

1857
02:20:27,800 --> 02:20:28,800
Sounds good.

1858
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:29,800
Maybe even a show.

1859
02:20:29,800 --> 02:20:33,800
Also, I want to put out there that song pack 11, I don't know if it's out, but at least

1860
02:20:33,800 --> 02:20:36,800
it's been announced that it's coming out.

1861
02:20:36,800 --> 02:20:40,800
I have not been able to get on Xbox Live in a couple weeks, so I have not seen myself.

1862
02:20:40,800 --> 02:20:45,200
I'm sure somebody in the chat room will correct me, however, one way or the other.

1863
02:20:45,200 --> 02:20:50,920
Yeah, it's going to be actually featuring, what was it, Diamond Jealousy by Kiryamoga,

1864
02:20:50,920 --> 02:21:00,160
that's hot, Guilty by DJ Setup, Helpless by Teko, Hold On Me by Tiger Yamamoto, which

1865
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:07,720
was also in DDR Extreme, and Open the PA by Akira Ishihara.

1866
02:21:07,720 --> 02:21:11,540
And that's the one we had no idea what game that's from.

1867
02:21:11,540 --> 02:21:13,900
It's a transplant of some sort, but we don't know from where it's from.

1868
02:21:13,900 --> 02:21:14,900
I have no idea.

1869
02:21:14,900 --> 02:21:16,060
I don't recognize it.

1870
02:21:16,060 --> 02:21:17,540
It's not from Dance Maniacs.

1871
02:21:17,540 --> 02:21:19,320
It's not from Para.

1872
02:21:19,320 --> 02:21:21,720
It's probably Beat Mania or Beat Mania 2, yeah.

1873
02:21:21,720 --> 02:21:26,020
Maybe somebody in the chat room will know where that is, but yeah.

1874
02:21:26,020 --> 02:21:27,020
All right.

1875
02:21:27,020 --> 02:21:29,140
Now, can we open up the Skype line?

1876
02:21:29,140 --> 02:21:30,140
Yes.

1877
02:21:30,140 --> 02:21:31,140
All right.

1878
02:21:31,140 --> 02:21:32,140
Let's do that.

1879
02:21:32,140 --> 02:21:33,140
Let's take some calls.

02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:35,820

1885
02:21:52,660 --> 02:22:00,300
going on let's take a call hi you're on orange launch radio who's this this is

1886
02:22:00,300 --> 02:22:05,380
RPG King 7 up in Canada hello RPGs got in hello yeah I'm super well you you've

1887
02:22:05,380 --> 02:22:09,140
been hammering us all night, so I'm not surprised you got in. No, that's all right. What's on

1888
02:22:09,140 --> 02:22:10,140
your mind, bud?

1889
02:22:10,140 --> 02:22:16,580
Well, I wish I had gotten down to E3. I'm really jealous of you guys that you got up,

1890
02:22:16,580 --> 02:22:21,460
got to go there, but you live on the west coast. I'm out here on the east coast.

1891
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:25,780
Well, here it is. If you want to know what E3 is like, you're up in Canada, right?

1892
02:22:25,780 --> 02:22:26,780
Yeah.

1893
02:22:26,780 --> 02:22:30,300
Start walking to L.A., and when you get to L.A., you'll know what it feels like to be

1894
02:22:30,300 --> 02:22:33,300
at E3.

1895
02:22:33,300 --> 02:22:37,580
Because you do nothing but walk around all day and occasionally stopping to play a video

1896
02:22:37,580 --> 02:22:38,580
game.

1897
02:22:38,580 --> 02:22:45,660
Okay, well, first thing I wanted to ask about is Castlevania Dawn of Sorrow for the DS.

1898
02:22:45,660 --> 02:22:46,660
Yes.

1899
02:22:46,660 --> 02:22:50,340
Well, what did you find out there or did you find anything out?

1900
02:22:50,340 --> 02:22:54,020
They had a demo running and I think it was actually, I think the game's pretty much complete.

1901
02:22:54,020 --> 02:22:55,740
I think it's going to be released almost imminently.

1902
02:22:55,740 --> 02:22:57,140
I did check it out.

1903
02:22:57,140 --> 02:23:01,700
It's pretty neat because what you get to do is it looks like Symphony of the Night.

1904
02:23:01,700 --> 02:23:02,700
It looks amazing.

1905
02:23:02,700 --> 02:23:06,620
Sound, I couldn't tell you because you can't hear a damn thing inside E3.

1906
02:23:06,620 --> 02:23:08,860
But it looks very similar to Symphony of the Night.

1907
02:23:08,860 --> 02:23:12,320
Basically you play on the bottom part of the screen and the top part of the screen is typically

1908
02:23:12,320 --> 02:23:15,580
what would have been your sub-screen in Symphony of the Night.

1909
02:23:15,580 --> 02:23:18,420
You can flip it back and forth though between that and your map.

1910
02:23:18,420 --> 02:23:21,660
So that's kind of cool because I think that's sort of the type of game that DS was really

1911
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,540
made for.

1912
02:23:23,540 --> 02:23:28,700
what you do is as you move through the game, when you get to certain points, you discover

1913
02:23:28,700 --> 02:23:33,300
these magic seals, and the magic seals are what you're supposed to do to defeat the boss.

1914
02:23:33,300 --> 02:23:37,660
So like the first one was very easy. The first magic seal in the demo I played was just a

1915
02:23:37,660 --> 02:23:42,420
little V shape. You just draw a V, okay? So it teaches you how to draw the seal, and then

1916
02:23:42,420 --> 02:23:46,480
what happens is when you go and fight the boss, when you beat the boss, the seal flies

1917
02:23:46,480 --> 02:23:50,380
up on the screen and you have to draw the seal like you learned it. And if you don't

1918
02:23:50,380 --> 02:23:56,380
If you don't do it, you don't beat the boss, and I think you have to do it all over.

1919
02:23:56,380 --> 02:23:59,380
That actually sounds pretty cool, yeah. Nice use of the stylus.

1920
02:23:59,380 --> 02:24:05,380
Yeah, and I think it's using the stylus without being kind of cheesy about it, like a lot of DS games to date have been.

1921
02:24:05,380 --> 02:24:12,380
I think this will satisfy a lot of folks that have been wanting some new Castlevania that looks more like Symphony of the Night.

1922
02:24:12,380 --> 02:24:19,380
This falls right along with the Castlevania Advance games. I think this will be a great addition to the series.

1923
02:24:19,380 --> 02:24:22,380
And it continues the storyline of Aria of Sorrow as well, so.

1924
02:24:22,380 --> 02:24:25,380
Yeah, which is really cool, because Aria of Sorrow is one of my favorite ones.

1925
02:24:25,380 --> 02:24:29,380
Ah, and something the chat room is saying is actually due out at the end of October.

1926
02:24:29,380 --> 02:24:31,380
I would have guessed that it would have been out a lot sooner,

1927
02:24:31,380 --> 02:24:34,380
because the game looked almost complete from what we saw,

1928
02:24:34,380 --> 02:24:37,380
but I guess it wasn't, but it looked pretty well done,

1929
02:24:37,380 --> 02:24:40,380
so maybe they're just waiting on it, I don't know.

1930
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:45,380
Yeah, I was excited to hear that 1998 and Into the Heat and the Night

1931
02:24:45,380 --> 02:24:47,380
are going to be on Xtreme 2, because those are, hands down,

1932
02:24:47,380 --> 02:24:51,380
Two of my favorite songs on the Arcade Mixes, Extreme and Fifth Mix.

1933
02:24:51,380 --> 02:24:53,380
I'm really excited to hear those are going to be on it.

1934
02:24:53,380 --> 02:24:56,380
Yeah, you could hear the giant hooray.

1935
02:24:56,380 --> 02:24:58,380
Well, it was kind of a mixed reaction.

1936
02:24:58,380 --> 02:25:01,380
It was a hooray and dope kind of coming from the crowd

1937
02:25:01,380 --> 02:25:03,380
when you saw that In the Heat of the Night was on Extreme 2.

1938
02:25:03,380 --> 02:25:05,380
You know, because the people that like Erotic,

1939
02:25:05,380 --> 02:25:06,380
yay, you know, finally we get Erotic.

1940
02:25:06,380 --> 02:25:09,380
And then the other people that hate Erotic are like, nah.

1941
02:25:09,380 --> 02:25:12,380
But I, for one, am happy about it, so.

1942
02:25:12,380 --> 02:25:15,380
Okay, I also want to ask you about Phantasy Star Universe.

1943
02:25:15,380 --> 02:25:17,340
I'm sure you've covered a lot of this on the podcast.

1944
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:19,460
I've only gotten to listen to the Wednesday podcast.

1945
02:25:19,460 --> 02:25:20,460
A little bit.

1946
02:25:20,460 --> 02:25:23,660
We talked about it a little bit.

1947
02:25:23,660 --> 02:25:24,940
I played one of them.

1948
02:25:24,940 --> 02:25:26,660
I think it was Fantasy Star Universe I played.

1949
02:25:26,660 --> 02:25:28,660
I heard they were showing another one in the Sega Theater.

1950
02:25:28,660 --> 02:25:29,160
I don't know.

1951
02:25:29,160 --> 02:25:32,820
But I did play Fantasy Star Universe a little bit.

1952
02:25:32,820 --> 02:25:35,520
It's very different from the online,

1953
02:25:35,520 --> 02:25:40,540
like the way it moves is very different, a lot more action

1954
02:25:40,540 --> 02:25:43,420
packed, I think, than the previous Fantasy Star Online,

1955
02:25:43,420 --> 02:25:44,540
at least the one I played.

1956
02:25:44,540 --> 02:25:49,620
I actually did a fight with a dragon, and I was playing with three other computer-controlled

1957
02:25:49,620 --> 02:25:53,540
players, and I really couldn't get a sense of whether this one was supposed to be online

1958
02:25:53,540 --> 02:25:58,280
or what the deal is, but the party I had was computer-controlled, and we were all just

1959
02:25:58,280 --> 02:26:03,300
beating up on this thing, and it was pretty challenging.

1960
02:26:03,300 --> 02:26:09,820
A lot more action-packed than I think the Phantasy Star Online was.

1961
02:26:09,820 --> 02:26:11,140
Just kind of different.

1962
02:26:11,140 --> 02:26:13,380
Don't go into it expecting Phantasy Star Online 2.

1963
02:26:13,380 --> 02:26:16,120
They've changed some things in it a little bit.

1964
02:26:16,120 --> 02:26:17,120
But I liked it.

1965
02:26:17,120 --> 02:26:18,860
It was just kind of fast-paced, and I liked that.

1966
02:26:18,860 --> 02:26:21,820
I think there need to be more fast-paced online games.

1967
02:26:21,820 --> 02:26:23,780
Oh, cool.

1968
02:26:23,780 --> 02:26:27,300
Because one thing I've always didn't like about Phantasy Star Online is it's a little

1969
02:26:27,300 --> 02:26:28,300
slow.

1970
02:26:28,300 --> 02:26:30,700
At least in my opinion, it's kind of slow.

1971
02:26:30,700 --> 02:26:33,220
I think you'll be satisfied with Phantasy Star Universe then.

1972
02:26:33,220 --> 02:26:35,460
They've really kind of upped the pace a little bit.

1973
02:26:35,460 --> 02:26:38,620
I also wanted to go with Kingdom Hearts 2.

1974
02:26:38,620 --> 02:26:39,620
Looks amazing.

1975
02:26:39,620 --> 02:26:46,980
following all the games on GameStop and GameTrailers.com, both of them have gotten really good E3 coverage

1976
02:26:46,980 --> 02:26:48,300
over the few days.

1977
02:26:48,300 --> 02:26:52,580
Right, yeah. Kingdom Hearts 2 I checked out as well. Did you play Kingdom Hearts 2 at

1978
02:26:52,580 --> 02:26:53,580
all, Logie?

1979
02:26:53,580 --> 02:26:54,580
No.

1980
02:26:54,580 --> 02:26:58,460
No, he's saying no. Kingdom Hearts 2 I actually played, they had two, actually four levels

1981
02:26:58,460 --> 02:27:04,100
playable in the E3 demo. Two boss battles and two levels, and both were either the Mulan

1982
02:27:04,100 --> 02:27:08,220
levels or the Hercules levels that you could play. The one I chose to play was the Hercules

1983
02:27:08,220 --> 02:27:11,220
and you actually have Auron in your party when you're playing.

1984
02:27:11,220 --> 02:27:14,220
It has this new mode called drive mode,

1985
02:27:14,220 --> 02:27:16,220
where I guess you're building up this meter as you're playing.

1986
02:27:16,220 --> 02:27:18,220
I couldn't really see how it was working,

1987
02:27:18,220 --> 02:27:22,220
but I had not one, but two Squenix reps come up to me and point this mode out.

1988
02:27:22,220 --> 02:27:24,220
Like, you have to try this.

1989
02:27:24,220 --> 02:27:27,220
And I guess what you do in drive is it's kind of similar to,

1990
02:27:27,220 --> 02:27:29,220
think, the overdrive from Final Fantasy VII,

1991
02:27:29,220 --> 02:27:32,220
where for a brief period of time you can be uber powerful.

1992
02:27:32,220 --> 02:27:37,220
Well, what you do is you actually fuse with one of the other characters in your party when you drive.

1993
02:27:37,220 --> 02:27:41,060
So, I actually fused with Auron and I just became this total badass.

1994
02:27:41,060 --> 02:27:44,980
I had like two, I had the Keyblade and another blade and I was just going around wailing

1995
02:27:44,980 --> 02:27:48,220
on everybody, just beating up all these things.

1996
02:27:48,220 --> 02:27:54,060
So, the drive mode is a pretty cool addition as well as now I notice you use the triangle

1997
02:27:54,060 --> 02:27:57,580
button that pops up, like you usually use it to open chests and stuff.

1998
02:27:57,580 --> 02:28:00,820
You use it for more things in this, so kind of interesting.

1999
02:28:00,820 --> 02:28:05,400
So, and the camera didn't bug the hell out of me like it did in Kingdom Hearts 1.

2000
02:28:05,400 --> 02:28:09,080
So I'm actually pretty excited about Kingdom Hearts 2.

2001
02:28:09,080 --> 02:28:11,080
So it looks good.

2002
02:28:11,080 --> 02:28:13,560
Zelda Twilight Princess.

2003
02:28:13,560 --> 02:28:14,560
We have to get it now.

2004
02:28:14,560 --> 02:28:15,560
I don't care.

2005
02:28:15,560 --> 02:28:16,560
We gotta have it now.

2006
02:28:16,560 --> 02:28:18,920
You know, the interesting thing about Zelda Twilight Princess, and as I'm sure you've

2007
02:28:18,920 --> 02:28:23,680
probably heard online one way or another, three hour wait at the show if you wanted

2008
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,680
to see this game.

2009
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:28,780
You had to wait in a three hour line, and only the first two days they had t-shirts.

2010
02:28:28,780 --> 02:28:32,140
They actually ran out halfway through the third day.

2011
02:28:32,140 --> 02:28:34,560
From what I hear, the game looks phenomenal.

2012
02:28:34,560 --> 02:28:37,880
I did not want to wait in the line.

2013
02:28:37,880 --> 02:28:43,040
All I know is that it is Link that turns into the wolf because we saw an extra clip of that,

2014
02:28:43,040 --> 02:28:45,120
and what can I say?

2015
02:28:45,120 --> 02:28:49,320
It's everything you Zelda fanboys and girls are wanting it to be, and I include myself

2016
02:28:49,320 --> 02:28:50,320
in that.

2017
02:28:50,320 --> 02:28:53,640
I'm looking forward to the game myself.

2018
02:28:53,640 --> 02:28:56,440
It's the game they should have released three years ago if they wanted the GameCube to be

2019
02:28:56,440 --> 02:28:59,520
super successful, but hey, better late than never, right?

2020
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:00,520
Right.

2021
02:29:00,520 --> 02:29:01,520
All right.

2022
02:29:01,520 --> 02:29:03,520
Well, we're going to let you go so we can get some other calls in, all right?

2023
02:29:03,520 --> 02:29:04,520
Okay, all right.

2024
02:29:04,520 --> 02:29:06,800
No problem. Thanks for calling. Have a good one. Thanks

2025
02:29:07,440 --> 02:29:11,000
All right, so some e3 questions there some various things. I'm actually surprised

2026
02:29:11,000 --> 02:29:16,320
I actually played all the games he called in to ask about because I didn't play that many games

2027
02:29:16,320 --> 02:29:21,720
There was a whole lot there. I didn't see if you guys have any questions. You can give us a call on the skype line

2031
02:29:34,400 --> 02:29:36,240
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

2032
02:29:36,240 --> 02:29:36,720
Hey, Sky.

2033
02:29:36,720 --> 02:29:37,280
Siggy here.

2034
02:29:37,280 --> 02:29:37,960
Hello, Siggy.

2035
02:29:37,960 --> 02:29:39,160
What's on your mind?

2036
02:29:39,160 --> 02:29:41,920
Well, I'm about to beat Mania USA.

2037
02:29:41,920 --> 02:29:43,920
I knew you'd have something to say about this.

2038
02:29:43,920 --> 02:29:44,680
Yeah.

2039
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:47,200
Big credits to Jason Enos for that.

2040
02:29:47,200 --> 02:29:47,960
Absolutely.

2041
02:29:47,960 --> 02:29:50,480
You know, I actually had a chance to talk with Jason Enos.

2042
02:29:50,480 --> 02:29:52,360
We didn't get an interview with him this year.

2043
02:29:52,360 --> 02:29:54,760
I talked to him off the record about some things.

2044
02:29:54,760 --> 02:29:56,320
I don't want to talk about everything

2045
02:29:56,320 --> 02:29:58,000
we talked about on air.

2046
02:29:58,000 --> 02:30:01,040
But one thing I mentioned was that, you know what?

2047
02:30:01,040 --> 02:30:01,920
Way to go.

2048
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,960
I'm so happy that B Manian is here.

2049
02:30:03,960 --> 02:30:06,120
and you're going to make a lot of people very happy with this.

2050
02:30:06,120 --> 02:30:09,240
And his response to me was something like, yeah, well,

2051
02:30:09,240 --> 02:30:10,960
you know, I've been trying for six years,

2052
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:11,920
and it's finally here.

2053
02:30:11,920 --> 02:30:13,720
So I'm happy, too.

2054
02:30:13,720 --> 02:30:16,960
So absolutely, send Jason Enos some flowers

2055
02:30:16,960 --> 02:30:20,520
if you kids are happy about this, because this is great.

2056
02:30:20,520 --> 02:30:21,260
Yeah.

2057
02:30:21,260 --> 02:30:25,440
And when I saw the song list for Five Piece,

2058
02:30:25,440 --> 02:30:27,800
oh, old school beat mania.

2059
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:31,360
Is that not a cool feature for us in the US to have?

2060
02:30:31,360 --> 02:30:32,080
Is that not cool?

2061
02:30:32,080 --> 02:30:33,000
Oh, hell yes.

2062
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:39,800
I mean, what a way to acknowledge the American audience and the fact that, okay, yeah, you

2063
02:30:39,800 --> 02:30:43,640
missed some things in Japan, but we're going to give this to you and it will allow you

2064
02:30:43,640 --> 02:30:48,440
to catch up and maybe, you know, hey, you know, might make some of the Japanese players

2065
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,440
a little jealous.

2066
02:30:49,440 --> 02:30:51,680
Hey, we get to play five key songs in a 2DX interface.

2067
02:30:51,680 --> 02:30:53,640
That's kind of cool.

2068
02:30:53,640 --> 02:30:54,640
Little bit.

2069
02:30:54,640 --> 02:30:55,640
It's a little bit.

2070
02:30:55,640 --> 02:31:10,640
Yeah, I recently saw a picture on GDR Freak. Someone posted the greetings for some Light 7 song, and like 167,000 points for a AAA. That's kind of ridiculous.

2071
02:31:10,640 --> 02:31:17,640
You know, I, again, I wouldn't, I heard of that too and I saw that picture as well, and I AAA'd a song as well.

2072
02:31:17,640 --> 02:31:28,640
I wouldn't take those ranking things as gospel just yet. It is an early build. The thing was stuck in beginner mode, really, even though it didn't look like it.

2073
02:31:28,640 --> 02:31:34,840
Yeah, I don't know how much they're going to futz with the grading system.

2074
02:31:34,840 --> 02:31:36,360
It's too early to tell.

2075
02:31:36,360 --> 02:31:40,560
I kind of would think they wouldn't touch it at all, and maybe just the fact that they

2076
02:31:40,560 --> 02:31:45,980
were doing what they did by putting the beginner songs in there was what caused those mathematical

2077
02:31:45,980 --> 02:31:49,600
things to come up with triple A's and what have you.

2078
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:50,800
But we'll see.

2079
02:31:50,800 --> 02:31:52,120
I don't really know.

2080
02:31:52,120 --> 02:31:56,580
It's too early to tell with the grades, but I wouldn't assume that they're going to dumb

2081
02:31:56,580 --> 02:32:03,340
it down just yet yeah so we'll see let me you know let me correct you some of

2082
02:32:03,340 --> 02:32:08,020
the pronunciation yes just only one song pronunciation it's a la bossa nova de

2083
02:32:08,020 --> 02:32:11,860
Fabian yes yeah thank you you know I'm horrible pronunciation la bossa nova de

2084
02:32:11,860 --> 02:32:17,540
Fabian I need to get my French there you go all right in a shining Polaris you

2085
02:32:17,540 --> 02:32:21,340
know Polaris and a polarity are the same I don't say Polaris I don't know why I

2086
02:32:21,340 --> 02:32:24,340
I think a polarium or something, I don't know.

2087
02:32:24,340 --> 02:32:26,340
It has something to do with polarity.

2088
02:32:26,340 --> 02:32:28,340
It's a potato-potato thing, though, I think.

2089
02:32:28,340 --> 02:32:30,340
Yeah.

2090
02:32:30,340 --> 02:32:34,340
Anything else you want to share? Other E3 things? Observations?

2091
02:32:34,340 --> 02:32:37,340
Well, just only Beatmania. I'm just happy with that.

2092
02:32:37,340 --> 02:32:42,340
I know. A lot of us people that have been 2DX fans for a long time,

2093
02:32:42,340 --> 02:32:44,340
and I've just been a casual 2DX fan,

2094
02:32:44,340 --> 02:32:46,340
a lot of you guys are being very hardcore,

2095
02:32:46,340 --> 02:32:48,340
a lot more hardcore than I am.

2096
02:32:48,340 --> 02:32:50,340
I think this is great that you guys are finally getting this.

2097
02:32:50,340 --> 02:32:54,700
getting this you know all of us are are getting this

2098
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:58,380
what i haven't really been checking a whole lot of web forums and stuff what

2099
02:32:58,380 --> 02:33:02,940
is the reaction to this been has it been overwhelmingly positive like about time

2100
02:33:02,940 --> 02:33:05,740
or are the skeptics already ready to

2101
02:33:05,740 --> 02:33:07,140
set fire to this next

2102
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:10,180
what do you think that you know i haven't been reading you know on both of

2103
02:33:10,180 --> 02:33:14,060
your pick and money style there have been you know like mixed reactions

2104
02:33:14,060 --> 02:33:16,820
but mostly leaning towards a positive side

2105
02:33:16,820 --> 02:33:45,820
That, you know, it's surprisingly enough, and I hate saying this, but it really, that does kind of surprise me because I figured most of the fanboys would be ready to tear into this, but I think by Konami keeping this a secret as long as they did, what they were able to do with this is that they were actually able to kind of set the standard the way they wanted to by unveiling this at E3 and showing us all these cool new features.

2106
02:33:45,820 --> 02:33:50,620
think if they had announced this a month ago and said we are going to show this at E3,

2107
02:33:50,620 --> 02:33:54,500
and I think this is the reason why this didn't happen, people would have made up what they

2108
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:59,520
wanted to be in the game, and they would have been disappointed when they didn't get that.

2109
02:33:59,520 --> 02:34:03,500
So I think by Konami unveiling it, you know, by keeping it a secret and then unveiling

2110
02:34:03,500 --> 02:34:06,660
it at the very end and showing this is what you are going to get, look at all these amazing

2111
02:34:06,660 --> 02:34:10,500
things, it kind of curved that a little bit, and I think it kind of helped the reaction

2112
02:34:10,500 --> 02:34:11,500
overall.

2113
02:34:11,500 --> 02:34:14,040
So I can't blame Konami at all for trying to keep this a secret, and they did.

2114
02:34:14,040 --> 02:34:19,480
This obviously has been worked on for quite some time, and actually, something we were

2115
02:34:19,480 --> 02:34:23,480
actually clued in on, but we wanted to keep it a secret, but I can talk about it now.

2116
02:34:23,480 --> 02:34:27,800
I gave you guys a hint last week about it, though, but actually, Konami registered the

2117
02:34:27,800 --> 02:34:31,080
patent for Beatmania some time ago in the U.S.

2118
02:34:31,080 --> 02:34:32,080
Oh, I read that.

2119
02:34:32,080 --> 02:34:33,080
I read that.

2120
02:34:33,080 --> 02:34:34,080
Yeah, yeah.

2121
02:34:34,080 --> 02:34:42,000
So, somebody had asked me to talk about it on this show, but kind of knowing that Konami,

2122
02:34:42,000 --> 02:34:45,340
if they were going to put out this game, would want to keep it a secret, I decided, you know,

2123
02:34:45,340 --> 02:34:48,800
we should, or we all decided really, that we should just kind of wait and see what happens

2124
02:34:48,800 --> 02:34:55,800
with it, because otherwise people will just start making stuff up. So, um, it's a good

2125
02:34:56,560 --> 02:35:03,560
thing. Well, anything else you want to share? Well, nothing much else. I just want to share

2126
02:35:05,920 --> 02:35:10,800
something, one of our comments in the chatroom, MPQ says, no matter how much it sucks, buy

2127
02:35:10,800 --> 02:35:14,800
Just so Konami knows, people will buy Beatmania here.

2128
02:35:14,800 --> 02:35:19,800
Oh yeah, about the controller, you know, the US release of the controller,

2129
02:35:19,800 --> 02:35:25,800
were you the one who mentioned like some improvements that would happen?

2130
02:35:25,800 --> 02:35:32,800
Rumors abound that there will be improvements to help curb the sticky key thing that goes on,

2131
02:35:32,800 --> 02:35:34,800
but nothing is set in stone yet.

2132
02:35:34,800 --> 02:35:38,800
But we do know they will release their own controllers here stateside.

2133
02:35:38,800 --> 02:35:43,800
The ones they showed at E3 were simply 2DX controllers from Japan, which, you know, makes sense.

2134
02:35:43,800 --> 02:35:48,800
The DDR with Mario and Matt was the same thing they have in Japan too, so...

2135
02:35:48,800 --> 02:35:54,800
I think we will see some improvements made to the controller, because they're gonna have to redo the controller anyway

2136
02:35:54,800 --> 02:36:00,800
to get the 2DX logo off the turntable, so why not fix the sticky key thing while you're at it?

2137
02:36:00,800 --> 02:36:03,800
I would say that we're gonna see some improvements.

2138
02:36:03,800 --> 02:36:13,800
It would be nice if they put micro switches on it, like cheap micro switches, not exactly from the arcade type of micro switches, to prevent the sticking.

2139
02:36:13,800 --> 02:36:18,800
That's an interesting thought, completely changed the way that the buttons kind of, the sensor system basically.

2140
02:36:18,800 --> 02:36:23,800
So, that would be interesting, I'd be interested to see that.

2141
02:36:23,800 --> 02:36:28,800
Yeah, and if they do put micro switches, I would buy it, I would buy it definitely.

2142
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:34,280
All right, yeah, I think what's interesting is that a lot of it, you know, and I need

2143
02:36:34,280 --> 02:36:40,320
a new 2DX controller very badly for my import copies, but now that I've heard that Beat

2144
02:36:40,320 --> 02:36:44,500
Mania is coming out in the USA, I'm just kind of going to wait for the U.S. controllers

2145
02:36:44,500 --> 02:36:47,560
to come out, because there's no sense of paying $100 to import a controller now when they're

2146
02:36:47,560 --> 02:36:52,600
going to release them here, probably $40, $50, much, I don't know, don't take my word

2147
02:36:52,600 --> 02:36:53,600
on that.

2148
02:36:53,600 --> 02:36:55,960
I mean, who knows how much these things are going to cost, but it will be cheaper than

2149
02:36:55,960 --> 02:36:57,720
importing it, that's for sure.

2150
02:36:57,720 --> 02:37:12,720
Yeah, and speaking of BeatMe and setting that aside, about PlayStation 3, I read from either IGN or GameSpot that they have six USB ports, which is, you know, like, are they really replacing the old controller port for that?

2151
02:37:12,720 --> 02:37:15,720
I didn't read up on PS3. What do you know about PS3?

2152
02:37:15,720 --> 02:37:20,720
It had a lot of USB ports. I know just for the pictures of it, it's got a buttload of...

2153
02:37:20,720 --> 02:37:23,720
Well, it's also got a bunch of weird things to it.

2154
02:37:23,720 --> 02:37:29,720
For one, it's got two HDTV outs on it, so you can actually have two HDTV setups.

2155
02:37:29,720 --> 02:37:33,720
One for the actual game plan, one for, like, almost like a dual screen...

2156
02:37:33,720 --> 02:37:34,720
Like a DS, basically.

2157
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:36,720
Like a DS, yeah.

2158
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:43,680
It's gonna have, I saw three Ethernet ports on there, now I don't know what the hell that's

2159
02:37:43,680 --> 02:37:48,440
about either, but it's just a lot of weird stuff on there, and I'm actually pulling up

2160
02:37:48,440 --> 02:37:56,240
the picture right now for my reference, but I remember also, I don't know, it just looked

2161
02:37:56,240 --> 02:38:00,120
interesting, and I know that it's gonna be Wi-Fi as well, but I don't see why you need

2162
02:38:00,120 --> 02:38:03,840
so many damn USB ports, but then again, I don't know why you need so many damn USB ports

2163
02:38:03,840 --> 02:38:04,840
on a computer.

2164
02:38:04,840 --> 02:38:09,060
going to be that we do know that every next-gen system is going to be wireless and their controllers

2165
02:38:09,060 --> 02:38:13,800
and stuff, so I kind of assume that the USB ports are for four for controllers and two

2166
02:38:13,800 --> 02:38:16,960
for whatever USB stuff you want to put in.

2167
02:38:16,960 --> 02:38:22,920
Well, here's a good shot of the back here right now, and I see, I count them, three

2168
02:38:22,920 --> 02:38:28,640
Ethernet ports, two USB ports, the AV out, which is like, you know, your standard AV

2169
02:38:28,640 --> 02:38:34,480
out, the digital audio out, the two HDTV outs, that's only on the back, then you've got,

2170
02:38:34,480 --> 02:38:38,340
And I honestly don't know why there's three ethernet ports, that makes no sense to me,

2171
02:38:38,340 --> 02:38:40,080
but whatever.

2172
02:38:40,080 --> 02:38:45,960
And then as far as front ports go, I remember there's at least a couple USB ports that are

2173
02:38:45,960 --> 02:38:49,960
underneath this like little cover thing on the front.

2174
02:38:49,960 --> 02:38:54,980
I'm trying to see if I can get a picture here, but anyways, yeah, so there's like a ton of

2175
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:55,980
stuff on there.

2176
02:38:55,980 --> 02:38:58,400
I don't know why, but I'm sure they've got a reason for it.

2177
02:38:58,400 --> 02:39:01,820
I think, okay, you have to remember with the next-gen systems too what everybody is doing,

2178
02:39:01,820 --> 02:39:02,820
not just Microsoft.

2179
02:39:02,820 --> 02:39:05,500
Microsoft's kind of been saying they're going to do this.

2180
02:39:05,500 --> 02:39:08,740
They're going to expand and not just be about gaming, right?

2181
02:39:08,740 --> 02:39:12,580
Microsoft wants to be an entertainment center where you can download music and do things

2182
02:39:12,580 --> 02:39:13,580
like that.

2183
02:39:13,580 --> 02:39:15,900
So I think you're going to see us on a lot of the next-gen systems that there's more

2184
02:39:15,900 --> 02:39:20,160
things to plug in there for your media setup at home than just your controllers.

2185
02:39:20,160 --> 02:39:22,260
And I think that's kind of what this is all about on PS3.

2186
02:39:22,260 --> 02:39:26,740
Yeah, and then I saw, you know, and then I read they're going to replace memory cards

2187
02:39:26,740 --> 02:39:29,900
with the memory stick duos for, you know, like a...

2188
02:39:29,900 --> 02:39:31,420
I don't think they would do that.

2189
02:39:31,420 --> 02:39:33,300
probably use speed drives of anything.

2190
02:39:33,300 --> 02:39:34,140
Oh, who knows?

2191
02:39:34,140 --> 02:39:35,820
We'll see.

2192
02:39:35,820 --> 02:39:37,780
All right, Siggy, we're going to let you go so we can just

2193
02:39:37,780 --> 02:39:39,380
get to some other stuff on the show.

2194
02:39:39,380 --> 02:39:39,700
Yeah.

2195
02:39:39,700 --> 02:39:41,180
But have a good one, buddy, OK?

2196
02:39:41,180 --> 02:39:41,980
All right, later.

2197
02:39:41,980 --> 02:39:42,980
Later.

2198
02:39:42,980 --> 02:39:45,780
I do know what some of those USB ports are going to be used for.

2199
02:39:45,780 --> 02:39:47,980
Interfacing with your PSP.

2200
02:39:47,980 --> 02:39:50,220
Yeah, well, that and wireless is going to be what's

2201
02:39:50,220 --> 02:39:51,140
going to be poor, too.

2202
02:39:51,140 --> 02:39:52,100
You can bet on that.

2203
02:39:52,100 --> 02:39:53,820
Can you guys imagine a member of the pocket station?

2204
02:39:53,820 --> 02:39:56,220
Yeah, but I've met most of you that don't remember that.

2205
02:39:56,220 --> 02:39:58,500
But that's what they're going to do, and we'll see.

2206
02:39:58,500 --> 02:40:00,900
All right, what we're going to do now is we're

2207
02:40:00,900 --> 02:40:04,500
actually not tonight going to have a cage match. We actually kind of ran out of time

2208
02:40:04,500 --> 02:40:08,840
and also, even though DarkSakara was able to send me her file, we're just running out

2209
02:40:08,840 --> 02:40:12,040
of time. We don't have time to do it. We figured you guys would want to know the E3 coverage

2210
02:40:12,040 --> 02:40:18,700
more than that. So, we'll table the cage match to next week, but we can't possibly get through

2211
02:40:18,700 --> 02:40:24,400
a show without doing some FUs of the week. So, let's get into the FUs of the week if

2212
02:40:24,400 --> 02:40:32,800
we can here. Loki, I did get some from Jamie, so I'll go ahead and start off with hers,

2213
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:38,040
FUs of the Week here. So, here we go. If you guys want to send in your FUs of the Week,

2214
02:40:38,040 --> 02:40:41,840
send a private message to Skye in the chat room. And after the FUs of the Week, we'll

2215
02:40:41,840 --> 02:40:47,040
go back to the Skype line and do some Ask Orange Lounge, actually, as well. So, here

2216
02:40:47,040 --> 02:40:52,200
we go, the FUs of the Week. Why is it, Loki, that we do the FUs of the Week? Because we

2217
02:40:52,200 --> 02:40:53,200
Well, we have to.

2218
02:40:53,200 --> 02:40:54,200
Alright.

2219
02:40:54,200 --> 02:41:08,920
Dark Sakura would like to say an F.U. to drama and sunburns and the fast pass being turned

2220
02:41:08,920 --> 02:41:12,200
off for Roger Rabbit.

2221
02:41:12,200 --> 02:41:13,200
Alright.

2222
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:16,200
Loki, your F.U.s of the week.

2223
02:41:16,200 --> 02:41:24,040
My first F.U. goes to Audioslave for having this giant concert in the middle of Hollywood

2224
02:41:24,040 --> 02:41:27,400
and Highlands, and that really sucked.

2225
02:41:27,400 --> 02:41:37,640
And also, fuck you to E3, or mainly just the convention hall, for stopping accepting credit

2226
02:41:37,640 --> 02:41:40,020
cards after a certain time.

2227
02:41:40,020 --> 02:41:43,560
And it's like during the middle of lunch rush, they're just like, yeah, we just don't want

2228
02:41:43,560 --> 02:41:54,560
We're gonna do credit cards, we're gonna do cash only. Of course you don't realize that until after you've gotten your food so you're fucked if you don't have, uh, cash. Luckily I've, you know, had cash so that was no problem.

2229
02:41:54,560 --> 02:42:06,560
Um, and basically also fuck you to Motel 6 for their crappy beds cause they're just uncomfortable as hell. And, um, yeah, that's pretty much it.

2230
02:42:06,560 --> 02:42:14,560
Fuck you to Rockstar for not actually showing any of their games and wasting a big space in E3.

2231
02:42:14,560 --> 02:42:20,560
And also to Nintendo for not having a revolution there because I wanted to see that.

2232
02:42:20,560 --> 02:42:24,560
That's it. My turn.

2233
02:42:24,560 --> 02:42:35,400
F you to that bitch at Konami's booth, not working there, somebody who is an observer,

2234
02:42:35,400 --> 02:42:40,260
that said I tried to dig my nails into her over a t-shirt and she whined and complained

2235
02:42:40,260 --> 02:42:42,560
like a little baby and got her boyfriend mad at me.

2236
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:46,600
I was so stunned that somebody would be so trite that I didn't even know what to say

2237
02:42:46,600 --> 02:42:47,600
back.

2238
02:42:47,600 --> 02:42:51,540
But if I could say anything back, I would say something along these lines.

2239
02:42:51,540 --> 02:42:56,820
Your girlfriend is lying to you about me digging my nails into her, she is making it up.

2240
02:42:56,820 --> 02:43:02,520
She's probably lying to you about being monogamous with you as well.

2241
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:06,720
So screw you lady and stupid boyfriend, how dare you call me an asshole.

2242
02:43:06,720 --> 02:43:11,160
I wish my posse was there to beat you up.

2243
02:43:11,160 --> 02:43:17,880
Also I'd like to give an F you to $8 hamburgers at E3 that aren't even that good.

2244
02:43:17,880 --> 02:43:21,920
having to wait in line for 45 minutes I'm not even kidding 45 minutes to get a

2245
02:43:21,920 --> 02:43:27,800
freaking hamburger it's horrible so an F you to the fact that the next two days

2246
02:43:27,800 --> 02:43:33,000
I had to eat lunch at 1030 if I wanted to avoid lines horrible and even then we

2247
02:43:33,000 --> 02:43:35,760
had to wait like what 15 minutes for a pizza that one day because I kept

2248
02:43:35,760 --> 02:43:40,320
dropping them yeah the second day we got pizza dumb bitch there didn't even

2249
02:43:40,320 --> 02:43:44,160
understand how to cook pizza which was quite funny because I love just watching

2250
02:44:14,160 --> 02:44:19,620
MPQ says F you to my wireless mouse the receiver broke now I have this mouse

2251
02:44:19,620 --> 02:44:22,700

02:44:22,700 --> 02:44:27,100
computer also an F you to shaza on the money style you're being a retard you're

2253
02:44:27,100 --> 02:44:32,540
pissing everyone off stop being stupid or go away I avoid web form drama very

2254
02:44:32,540 --> 02:44:39,420
much so I don't know what to tell you on that one um let's see next step you comes

2255
02:44:39,420 --> 02:44:45,580
from Ronchan. F you to my job for cutting my hours again. Screw you guys, I'm going

2256
02:44:45,580 --> 02:44:55,320
to an amazement this weekend. Miklatov says F you to moving, the end. And illusion says

2257
02:44:55,320 --> 02:45:01,060
F you to the never ending star testing that was stretched over this entire month. It's

2258
02:45:01,060 --> 02:45:04,780
still not done. F you to in the groove being pushed back, though they say it doesn't have

2259
02:45:04,780 --> 02:45:08,380
to do with the lawsuit and by they I mean VX Jason XB.

2260
02:45:08,380 --> 02:45:12,860
Illusion if you've been listening earlier in the show, I talked to a Red Octane rep

2261
02:45:12,860 --> 02:45:15,500
and they said it doesn't have anything to do with the lawsuit.

2262
02:45:15,500 --> 02:45:18,860
FU to no cage match, oh screw you.

2263
02:45:18,860 --> 02:45:21,740
There is so time left, there's an hour left in the show.

2264
02:45:21,740 --> 02:45:27,460
I don't know what clock you're looking at but I see there's 15 minutes left.

2265
02:45:27,460 --> 02:45:29,500
And god we're not in that time zone.

2266
02:45:29,500 --> 02:45:32,780
Crouton 6 says FU to Loki for hating in the groove.

2267
02:45:32,780 --> 02:45:36,780
Oh yeah, well fuck in the groove for sucking.

2268
02:45:36,780 --> 02:45:41,780
Darkknight says, F you to early morning meetings at work and poor road trip planning.

2269
02:45:41,780 --> 02:45:45,780
Having to schedule some time off for a racing event that was actually moved to next weekend.

2270
02:45:45,780 --> 02:45:50,780
And having to work Saturday, missing the cookout of cookouts. Damn you to hell, Job!

2271
02:45:52,780 --> 02:45:57,780
Rychan says, F you to cheap power supplies that die on Friday the 13th. Ooh, that's a sign.

2272
02:45:57,780 --> 02:46:02,780
Yeah, the power supply sucked. I guess so. Alright, that's it. That's all the FUs we got.

2273
02:46:02,780 --> 02:46:07,780
So, there you have it. Oh, one more. One late one that just came in. Lemon Line Jump.

2274
02:46:07,780 --> 02:46:12,780
FU to myself for making myself sick. I ruined my own Monday.

2275
02:46:12,780 --> 02:46:17,780
How do you ruin your own Monday? Alright.

2276
02:46:17,780 --> 02:46:22,780
I guess what we're going to do

2277
02:46:22,780 --> 02:46:26,860
is do a quick break, then we'll come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge

2278
02:46:26,860 --> 02:46:31,660
because I'm sure you guys have some questions after E3. And to make Loki

2279
02:46:31,660 --> 02:46:36,340
very happy with me, I think what we'll actually do in this break is play some music from

2280
02:46:36,340 --> 02:46:36,860
In the Groove.

2281
02:46:36,860 --> 02:46:42,260
Whatever, I don't care. So we'll be back after this quick break, just a couple

2282
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:43,620
songs here, and then we're going to do some

2283
02:46:43,620 --> 02:46:47,760
Ask Orange Lounge. So send your questions over to Skye in the chat room, and we'll be back

2284
02:46:47,760 --> 02:46:54,760
after this.

2285
02:47:17,760 --> 02:47:28,760
There will be like a fire in the sky for me

2286
02:47:28,760 --> 02:47:36,760
Finding your way to my home, my body

2287
02:47:36,760 --> 02:48:04,760
Free like a bird in the sky

2288
02:48:34,760 --> 02:48:36,760
Come play with me

2289
02:49:06,760 --> 02:49:13,760
We made the last step, we're ready to go We made the last step, we're ready to go

2290
02:49:36,760 --> 02:49:39,760
Please remember not to suffer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

2291
02:49:39,760 --> 02:49:43,760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

2292
02:49:43,760 --> 02:49:44,760
Please remember not summer after forty minutes that's the end of ever

I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready

2299
02:50:53,760 --> 02:51:04,480
After this song, we'll be having a Let Them Move marathon.

2300
02:51:04,480 --> 02:51:05,480
Nooooooo!

2301
02:51:05,480 --> 02:51:07,640
Just kidding.

2302
02:51:07,640 --> 02:51:11,160
Orange Lounge Radio, crap-free Bhavani radio.

2303
02:51:11,160 --> 02:51:15,900
Hello, we are back here on Orange Lounge Radio Live, wrapping things up here with a little

2304
02:51:15,900 --> 02:51:17,040
bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

2305
02:51:17,040 --> 02:51:23,100
In that break, you heard some In the Groove music, Nina with Fly With Me and Mind Reflection

2306
02:51:23,100 --> 02:51:27,400
with Remember December was that last one. That's a fan favorite, believe it or not.

2307
02:51:27,400 --> 02:51:32,100
I do not care for that song at all, but the fans asked me to play it, so I do. So there

2308
02:51:32,100 --> 02:51:35,640
you have it. I do like the Fly With Me song, though. I do like that one. I just don't like

2309
02:51:35,640 --> 02:51:42,680
Remember December, personally. Let's get into Ask Orange Lounge, where you guys, the listeners,

2310
02:51:42,680 --> 02:51:46,920
get to control the show by sending us questions, and we answer them. It's just that simple.

2311
02:51:46,920 --> 02:51:53,920
it's really it's really an easy concept honestly

2312
02:51:55,600 --> 02:51:58,760
let's ask orange lounge some stupid question

2313
02:51:58,760 --> 02:52:02,600
what will we find out this week on orange lounge radio

2314
02:52:02,600 --> 02:52:06,320
I hope they have some questions to ask us about E3

2315
02:52:06,320 --> 02:52:09,840
and not so much random stuff this week because that gets annoying

2316
02:52:09,840 --> 02:52:13,800
I like how you add the extra syllable and orange

2317
02:52:13,800 --> 02:52:18,800
Or Eng... Or Enza!

2318
02:52:18,800 --> 02:52:23,800
Look, that's the best thing I gotta do by improvising here.

2319
02:52:23,800 --> 02:52:28,800
Hey, at least you had better grammar than that one distribution company.

2320
02:52:28,800 --> 02:52:36,800
Crouton6 wants to know, is there any known way to hook up my $400 2DX arcade style controller to a freaking PS3?

2321
02:52:36,800 --> 02:52:42,600
Um, if PS3 is backwards compatible, which I believe they have said it will be PS2 and PS1 backwards compatible,

2322
02:52:42,600 --> 02:52:47,980
you can bet that there will be some type of converter that will turn one of the USB ports into a regular controller port.

2323
02:52:47,980 --> 02:52:51,760
Guaranteed. There's gotta be something. I mean, otherwise you can't be backwards compatible, so...

2324
02:52:51,760 --> 02:52:57,400
Well, yes you can, because you can still play the old games with the, um, DualShock sort of controllers.

2325
02:52:57,400 --> 02:53:03,760
But here's the thing, though, what you can do that I know they have this, too, is some sort of Wi-Fi thing that you plug into,

2326
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:07,240
um, your normal controllers and it's just like, you know, basically...

2327
02:53:07,240 --> 02:53:10,960
There'll be a way.

2328
02:53:10,960 --> 02:53:15,120
Yeah, there'll be a way. There's gotta be something. That's why you need to save your old

2329
02:53:15,120 --> 02:53:16,640
PS2 and don't sell it.

2330
02:53:16,640 --> 02:53:20,840
Uh, Illusion wants to know, were we supposed to set our watches an hour

2331
02:53:20,840 --> 02:53:22,560
forward daylight savings time?

2332
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:26,400
About three weeks ago that happened, didn't it?

2333
02:53:26,400 --> 02:53:30,920
Spring forward, fall back, right? Yeah, we did that a while ago. What the hell, dude?

2334
02:53:30,920 --> 02:53:34,920
Alright, he says, I wasn't here for the first hour or two hours. I don't know. I'm lost in time.

2335
02:53:34,920 --> 02:53:38,920
I really don't know when I came in. Anyway, can you guys give me a quick summary on what happened?

2336
02:53:38,920 --> 02:53:42,920
Okay, for those of you who joined late,

2337
02:53:42,920 --> 02:53:46,920
we talked about E3 and what we did. Well, actually, no, we can't tell you, but what you

2338
02:53:46,920 --> 02:53:50,920
can do is you can check into the reruns that we play on DDR Freak Radio.

2339
02:53:50,920 --> 02:53:54,920
There you go! Friday! There you go! There you go! Nice plug there. You can listen to

2340
02:53:54,920 --> 02:53:58,920
the rewind on DDR Freak Radio Friday nights. Um, just to sum

2341
02:53:58,920 --> 02:54:03,920
We talked BeatMania, USA, and the DDRs. We played a song that's going to be in DDR Extreme 2.

2342
02:54:03,920 --> 02:54:06,920
And we gave away a million dollars and you didn't win.

2343
02:54:06,920 --> 02:54:10,920
And we played the bootleg copy of the new MIDI head mix from UltraMix 3.

2344
02:54:10,920 --> 02:54:14,920
And what was that song from Extreme 2, Plovotlian Dance and Chorus, something like that?

2345
02:54:14,920 --> 02:54:15,920
I'm not even going to try to pronounce it.

2346
02:54:15,920 --> 02:54:17,920
We played it.

2347
02:54:17,920 --> 02:54:24,920
Darkknight says, Sky, was the G4 bit with you guys for G4tv.com show or another show?

2348
02:54:24,920 --> 02:54:27,920
Where you're going to see it, from what I understand, if they even use it, which I don't know,

2349
02:54:27,920 --> 02:54:36,420
It's G4TV.com, the show, and it's like when they're coming back from commercial, they'll probably show the booth and we're clapping.

2350
02:54:36,420 --> 02:54:41,420
And I'm wearing a bright ass green shirt and a t-shirt, so you can't miss me.

2351
02:54:41,420 --> 02:54:44,420
And then Loki's standing right next to me, and I don't remember what you were wearing that day.

2352
02:54:44,420 --> 02:54:45,420
I don't remember either.

2353
02:54:45,420 --> 02:54:48,420
And Mikotov was standing with us as well, so you could see him too.

2354
02:54:48,420 --> 02:54:55,420
I don't remember, no, I think the last day I wore, it was like a, just a normal shirt.

2355
02:54:55,420 --> 02:54:59,420
But yeah, I had a bag. An Xbox 360 bag.

2356
02:54:59,420 --> 02:55:03,420
I think I had one too. Um, let's see.

2357
02:55:03,420 --> 02:55:07,420
MPQ, should I bother going to episode 3? Do you think it's worth the trouble?

2358
02:55:07,420 --> 02:55:11,420
I haven't seen episode 3. I'm not, like, huge on Star Wars.

2359
02:55:11,420 --> 02:55:15,420
I will see the movie, but I'm gonna wait until the frenzy dies down.

2360
02:55:15,420 --> 02:55:19,420
Yes, it's worth the trouble from what I hear.

2361
02:55:19,420 --> 02:55:23,420
It's what the fans have been looking for. I mean, and also, in other news,

2362
02:55:23,420 --> 02:55:29,420
War of the Worlds is supposed to be what people were expecting for Independence Day and signs.

2363
02:55:29,420 --> 02:55:32,420
In other words, it's not going to disappoint you.

2364
02:55:32,420 --> 02:55:34,420
New trailer online, by the way.

2365
02:55:34,420 --> 02:55:38,420
Oh, really? It looks spiffy. We'll have to look into that.

2366
02:55:38,420 --> 02:55:39,420
Alright, let's see.

2367
02:55:39,420 --> 02:55:50,420
VidPowah, on a scale of 1 sucktastic to 10 fantastic, rate your overall E3 experience.

2368
02:55:50,420 --> 02:55:52,420
I give mine a seven.

2369
02:55:54,420 --> 02:55:56,420
Honestly, I give mine about a six.

2370
02:55:57,420 --> 02:56:02,420
I had a good time overall, but I think I was a little more into it last year than I was.

2371
02:56:02,420 --> 02:56:04,420
It was just too crowded this year, and I was just too tired.

2372
02:56:04,420 --> 02:56:07,420
I had too much other stuff going on, other drama, too, that I don't need to talk about on a radio show.

2373
02:56:07,420 --> 02:56:09,420
It's too much media-only stuff.

2374
02:56:10,420 --> 02:56:15,420
Honestly, if they want just media only coming in there, don't invite everyone else. Just invite the media.

2375
02:56:17,420 --> 02:56:18,420
But invite us, still, please.

2376
02:56:18,420 --> 02:56:21,920
Well, we're media now. Yeah, we're gonna be media next year, we hope.

2377
02:56:21,920 --> 02:56:25,920
Ranchan says, okay, Sky, or Ronchan maybe, sorry.

2378
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:29,920
Ronchan says, okay, Sky, please explain the ferret, because I'm lost.

2379
02:56:29,920 --> 02:56:31,420
And, so we'll do that.

2380
02:56:31,420 --> 02:56:37,420
Uh, the ferret is basically these little toys that we bought a long time ago.

2381
02:56:37,420 --> 02:56:40,920
No, one of them was given to me as a Christmas present, like, years ago.

2382
02:56:40,920 --> 02:56:42,420
Years ago, before we were even...

2383
02:56:42,420 --> 02:56:44,920
We've been doing Orange Lounge Radio for, like, three years.

2384
02:56:44,920 --> 02:56:47,420
And one of these... Okay, stop it.

2385
02:56:47,420 --> 02:56:51,420
One of those was given to me like three years ago and Jamie found it one show

2386
02:56:51,420 --> 02:56:54,420
like it was sitting on my dresser or something and she started playing with it

2387
02:56:54,420 --> 02:56:56,420
and she was giggling and thought it was the cutest thing ever

2388
02:56:56,420 --> 02:56:59,420
and she hasn't stopped since.

2389
02:56:59,420 --> 02:57:01,420
It was like two years ago.

2390
02:57:01,420 --> 02:57:04,420
And then one day, just to be funny, I bought about six of them.

2391
02:57:04,420 --> 02:57:05,420
Oh, I hate you.

2392
02:57:05,420 --> 02:57:08,420
And I repaired them because they had dead batteries

2393
02:57:08,420 --> 02:57:10,420
so I had to cut them open and repair them

2394
02:57:10,420 --> 02:57:13,420
and then one of them got stuck on the Katamari.

2395
02:57:13,420 --> 02:57:15,420
Where did you find?

2396
02:57:15,420 --> 02:57:19,620
Those they were what people want to buy them. You're not going to find them anywhere. They're called

2397
02:57:20,260 --> 02:57:23,160
Scoosies is what they're called. It's like s see

2398
02:57:24,340 --> 02:57:30,540
Use easy or ie or z ie you can find them on eBay. They're kind of expensive

2399
02:57:31,180 --> 02:57:34,800
But that those are where I found them. I found them at discount toy stores

2400
02:57:34,800 --> 02:57:35,420
basically

2401
02:57:35,420 --> 02:57:36,740
the discount

2402
02:57:36,740 --> 02:57:42,780
Outlet store for KB and I bought what it was left and there was hardly anything left and they were dead

2403
02:57:42,780 --> 02:57:48,060
I like I like Dark Knight summary there. She uses the ferret to annoy sky to death. Yep. You got it

2404
02:57:48,120 --> 02:57:50,120
Yep, you can find them on eBay

2405
02:57:50,480 --> 02:57:55,720
Okay, Ron Chan also wants to know Loki your favorite Nintendo character my favorite Nintendo character

2406
02:57:56,680 --> 02:57:58,680
I

2407
02:57:59,340 --> 02:58:01,340
Don't know

2408
02:58:02,800 --> 02:58:06,280
We'll just say Zelda I get our link link thinks kind of cool

2409
02:58:06,280 --> 02:58:10,720
I don't have a really favorite Nintendo character. Let's let you want to include

2410
02:58:10,720 --> 02:58:18,400
include Super Joe from Bionic Commando, because technically he was on Nintendo.

2411
02:58:18,400 --> 02:58:22,640
My favorite would be, without a doubt, the Eggplant Wizard, but not from the cartoon.

2412
02:58:22,640 --> 02:58:28,540
Not the cartoon Eggplant. That guy was disgusting. The Eggplant Wizard, as portrayed in the original

2413
02:58:28,540 --> 02:58:33,160
8-bit Icarus, was awesome. If not the Eggplant, and that's why they need to make a new kid

2414
02:58:33,160 --> 02:58:37,800
Icarus, please, please Nintendo, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top. I don't care. Put

2415
02:58:37,800 --> 02:58:45,360
on the DS. I don't care. Just make me a new one. King Hippo, a close second. King Hippo

2416
02:58:45,360 --> 02:58:52,340
was a badass. Doobs is asking, what happened with Kingdom Hearts 2? I think it's too late

2417
02:58:52,340 --> 02:58:55,440
for a question. No, you're not too late for a question, but I did talk about Kingdom Hearts

2418
02:58:55,440 --> 02:59:00,920
2 with a previous caller, so I hope you were listening. Again, Kingdom Hearts 2, it's like

2419
02:59:00,920 --> 02:59:04,760
Kingdom Hearts 1, but with a better camera and orans in it, which is very cool.

2420
02:59:04,760 --> 02:59:06,760
And it looks like the graphics are upgraded, too.

2421
02:59:06,760 --> 02:59:08,760
And overdrive mode, or drive mode.

2422
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:11,760
It's really amazing, actually, what they've done with that engine.

2423
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:14,760
Like, thousands of characters on the screen at one time.

2424
02:59:14,760 --> 02:59:16,760
You know, it's pretty nice.

2425
02:59:16,760 --> 02:59:20,760
So yeah, pretty awesome game. Definitely get it when it comes in.

2426
02:59:20,760 --> 02:59:22,760
All right.

2427
02:59:22,760 --> 02:59:26,760
And that's it. That's all the questions we got tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.

2428
02:59:26,760 --> 02:59:29,760
So, doo doo doo doo doo doo. I guess that's it.

2429
02:59:29,760 --> 02:59:32,760
Oh, Doobs is confessing he wasn't there. He was gone.

2430
02:59:32,760 --> 02:59:36,960
Oh, that was the best part, too. You just reminded me. Remember when they were having

2431
02:59:36,960 --> 02:59:43,680
all the technical issues with more friends and the one guitarist from the Black Manges

2432
02:59:43,680 --> 02:59:48,160
all doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo on the guitar? That was awesome.

2433
02:59:48,160 --> 02:59:52,660
That was pretty awesome. One other thing I want to mention, this is a question that came

2434
02:59:52,660 --> 02:59:56,320
up way earlier in the show, I want to say it was Dork or somebody in our chat room said

2435
02:59:56,320 --> 03:00:01,560
this, wants to know why on GameSpot when he's looking at all the BeatMania pictures he sees

2436
03:00:01,560 --> 03:00:05,400
these random pictures that have nothing to do with BeatMania. Well let me put it

2437
03:00:05,400 --> 03:00:09,640
this way, this is what happens. A lot of these websites out there, GameSpot, IGN,

2438
03:00:09,640 --> 03:00:14,400
all those big guys, they're lazy and what they do, all they do is they just upload

2439
03:00:14,400 --> 03:00:18,520
everything from the press kit onto their site as screenshots, okay? Now we all do

2440
03:00:18,520 --> 03:00:22,400
it, all of us in the media do it, because the media kit screenshots are all we've

2441
03:00:22,400 --> 03:00:25,600
got to go off of. But what Konami did with their press kit, which is very

2442
03:00:25,600 --> 03:00:30,640
interesting, is they actually included all these concept art pieces or

2443
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:35,200
fragments of the animations you see in the video. Which I will be using for my own

2444
03:00:35,200 --> 03:00:39,960
reference. Here's the thing, they are in Photoshop format, super high quality. If

2445
03:00:39,960 --> 03:00:43,520
you want to build a website, get your hands one way or another on a Konami

2446
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:47,940
press kit because they've got these great Beatmania concepts, just the

2447
03:00:47,940 --> 03:00:52,340
industrial things, the spinning things you see, all that stuff. It would also be

2448
03:00:52,340 --> 03:00:58,600
awesome to do with that, to make your own Beatmania skin for Stepmania. I'm not

2449
03:00:58,600 --> 03:01:00,740
doing it. I ain't putting that effort in.

2450
03:01:00,740 --> 03:01:05,320
So that's why you see it in there, because they didn't realize that those were not game

2451
03:01:05,320 --> 03:01:10,240
screenshots, but it's just concept art and pieces. It's for you to use, like if you want

2452
03:01:10,240 --> 03:01:14,860
to make like a BeatMania themed webpage, seriously, that's exactly what it's for. At least my

2453
03:01:14,860 --> 03:01:16,480
impression. So that's kind of cool.

2454
03:01:16,480 --> 03:01:21,380
You know, I'm really sad that none of the trailer videos on there, that they were running

2455
03:01:21,380 --> 03:01:26,320
that little reel, because I wanted that, because the music in it was awesome, and I wanted

2456
03:01:26,320 --> 03:01:28,320
to steal the music.

2457
03:01:28,320 --> 03:01:35,320
This is going to be the last question from our chat room here.

2458
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:40,320
Multiple people are asking me this, so all you guys want to know.

2459
03:01:40,320 --> 03:01:46,320
Did they ever show Jam with the Band for the Nintendo DS?

2460
03:01:46,320 --> 03:01:48,320
I didn't see it anywhere.

2461
03:01:48,320 --> 03:01:49,320
Nope.

2462
03:01:49,320 --> 03:01:50,320
I didn't see it.

2463
03:01:50,320 --> 03:01:51,320
I didn't see it either.

2464
03:01:51,320 --> 03:01:52,320
I guess they didn't show it.

2465
03:01:52,320 --> 03:01:55,320
Unless I somehow completely missed it, which is possible.

2466
03:01:55,320 --> 03:01:57,320
We did play a music game on Gizmondo.

2467
03:01:57,320 --> 03:01:59,320
Yeah, what was that Gizmondo music game you played real quick?

2468
03:01:59,320 --> 03:02:00,320
I don't remember.

2469
03:02:00,320 --> 03:02:01,320
It was some guitar game.

2470
03:02:01,320 --> 03:02:02,320
It was kind of weird.

2471
03:02:02,320 --> 03:02:07,320
It's like a guitar game, sort of like, I don't even know how to compare it,

2472
03:02:07,320 --> 03:02:11,320
but it's very, it's like a rhythm music game with action game mixed in it.

2473
03:02:11,320 --> 03:02:12,320
It was kind of weird.

2474
03:02:12,320 --> 03:02:13,320
Dark Sakura actually played it a little more.

2475
03:02:13,320 --> 03:02:15,320
Maybe she could fill you in on it next week.

2476
03:02:15,320 --> 03:02:16,320
Don't forget to ask.

2477
03:02:16,320 --> 03:02:17,320
Last, last one real quick.

2478
03:02:17,320 --> 03:02:19,320
Doobs wants to know, if you didn't talk about this already,

2479
03:02:19,320 --> 03:02:21,320
what happened with the Katamari?

2480
03:02:21,320 --> 03:02:22,320
We don't know.

2481
03:02:22,320 --> 03:02:23,320
We imagine they rolled it out the door.

2482
03:02:23,320 --> 03:02:26,040
It's probably sitting in Namco's big office somewhere.

2483
03:02:26,040 --> 03:02:27,160
They probably think it's funny.

2484
03:02:27,160 --> 03:02:28,120
But our media sampler's on there.

2485
03:02:28,120 --> 03:02:30,960
Our media sampler's on there, and then a few inches away, the ferret.

2486
03:02:30,960 --> 03:02:34,280
Yeah, so kind of funny.

2487
03:02:34,280 --> 03:02:36,240
Which we'll have pictures of that online soon, hopefully.

2488
03:02:36,240 --> 03:02:36,920
It'll be interesting.

2489
03:02:36,920 --> 03:02:38,880
I'd be curious to know what they are going to do with that katamari.

2490
03:02:38,880 --> 03:02:44,120
Oh, I did check out my camera and the pictures that it took, and they all suck.

2491
03:02:44,120 --> 03:02:49,680
So not much in, pretty much everything that we have that I took a picture of, we have a

2492
03:02:49,680 --> 03:02:51,160
better copy in the press kit.

2493
03:02:51,160 --> 03:02:57,160
Jamie said something. Jamie said something that she took something like 600 pictures.

2494
03:02:57,160 --> 03:03:03,160
It's insane. Oh Lord. I took like 70 or 80 at most. She took like 600.

2495
03:03:03,160 --> 03:03:07,160
I took 117. I deleted most of them. Oh! You know what else I want to say?

2496
03:03:07,160 --> 03:03:13,160
Hello to our French listeners, if any folks from France. You know that I actually sent some of my pictures a couple days ago to that.

2497
03:03:13,160 --> 03:03:18,160
Remember I had like a misrouted email from some French Nintendo site and now I've been talking to the guy?

2498
03:03:18,160 --> 03:03:23,660
They actually put them up on their site. I think it's like P-Nintendo.com or something, and it stands for something in French.

2499
03:03:23,660 --> 03:03:24,660
I don't know. I don't speak French.

2500
03:03:24,660 --> 03:03:29,160
But they actually put the pictures I sent up, the Nintendo-specific ones.

2501
03:03:29,160 --> 03:03:32,160
So we've actually been getting a lot of hits today because of that.

2502
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:36,160
So hello to any of our new listeners who might be French, coming from the French Nintendo site.

2503
03:03:36,160 --> 03:03:39,160
And I don't speak it, so I'm not going to even try to pronounce the name of the site.

2504
03:03:39,160 --> 03:03:41,160
But we appreciate the shout-out nonetheless.

2505
03:03:41,160 --> 03:03:44,660
The last French I learned was back in sixth grade, and I can't remember.

2506
03:03:44,660 --> 03:03:49,020
The only thing I know how to say is, uh, what are you doing this weekend, and I'm sure that's

2507
03:03:49,020 --> 03:03:52,340
useful in some instance, but, uh...

2508
03:03:52,340 --> 03:03:53,340
Alright.

2509
03:03:53,340 --> 03:03:54,340
Um...

2510
03:03:54,340 --> 03:03:55,340
That's it.

2511
03:03:55,340 --> 03:03:56,340
We gotta wrap up the show, you guys.

2512
03:03:56,340 --> 03:03:59,340
Uh, some folks in the chatroom are asking about the sex game, they wanna hear your story

2513
03:03:59,340 --> 03:04:00,340
with the sex game.

2514
03:04:00,340 --> 03:04:03,620
I'm gonna have to tell you guys, go to the podcast, cause it's all in the podcast, uh,

2515
03:04:03,620 --> 03:04:05,140
Thursday and Friday's edition.

2516
03:04:05,140 --> 03:04:06,140
You can talk about it.

2517
03:04:06,140 --> 03:04:08,620
Uh, their website, unfortunately, does not have anything about the game, or at least

2518
03:04:08,620 --> 03:04:12,740
it's all in Korean and I couldn't figure it out, so, no.

2519
03:04:12,740 --> 03:04:16,040
I will purchase the game because I actually told Nellie about it and she wanted to play

2520
03:04:16,040 --> 03:04:17,200
it.

2521
03:04:17,200 --> 03:04:18,880
Even after I told her about the Purrfuls.

2522
03:04:18,880 --> 03:04:21,640
So I don't know if that's going to be interesting.

2523
03:04:21,640 --> 03:04:25,440
Alright, we are out of here you guys.

2524
03:04:25,440 --> 03:04:27,680
Final thought, Loki.

2525
03:04:27,680 --> 03:04:30,440
I drank too much water.

2526
03:04:30,440 --> 03:04:36,160
And my final thought is, I'm hungry and I feel like a, I feel like one of those McDonald's

2527
03:04:36,160 --> 03:04:38,960
fruit and walnut salads for some weird ass reason.

2528
03:04:38,960 --> 03:04:40,720
Ice cream would be really good too though.

2529
03:04:40,720 --> 03:04:42,040
I gotta eat yogurt.

2530
03:04:42,040 --> 03:04:44,680
I got this thing of yogurt and it's getting old.

2531
03:04:44,680 --> 03:04:46,960
Final word of the show.

2532
03:04:46,960 --> 03:04:47,760
Good night, everybody.

2533
03:04:47,760 --> 03:04:48,520
Have a good one.

2534
03:04:48,520 --> 03:04:50,920
And we'll see you next week with More Orange Lounge.

2535
03:04:50,920 --> 03:04:51,800
Dark Sakura will be back.

2536
03:04:51,800 --> 03:04:53,800
We hope to have guests in the studio as well.

2537
03:04:53,800 --> 03:04:56,880
Don't forget to check out our podcast and other live shows.

2538
03:04:56,880 --> 03:04:59,400
There will be a surprise live show this week as well.

2539
03:04:59,400 --> 03:05:01,400
That's all I'm going to say.

2540
03:05:01,400 --> 03:05:01,880
Tune in.

2541
03:05:01,880 --> 03:05:03,440
Maybe our live journal community will have more

2542
03:05:03,440 --> 03:05:04,200
information on that.

2543
03:05:04,200 --> 03:05:04,880
We'll see.

2544
03:05:04,880 --> 03:05:06,600
And tonight's Fortune Cookie.

2545
03:05:06,600 --> 03:05:09,040
Dark Sakura didn't send me a new one just yet, so you get a

2546
03:05:09,040 --> 03:05:11,880
classic Fortune Cookie from our archives that I love.

2547
03:05:11,880 --> 03:05:13,560
Final word of the show, Loki.

2548
03:05:13,560 --> 03:05:15,200
One word that sums it all up.

2549
03:05:15,200 --> 03:05:17,240
Beatmania.

2550
03:05:17,240 --> 03:05:19,880
That does it for another episode of

2551
03:05:19,880 --> 03:05:22,800
Orange Lounge Radio Live.

2552
03:05:22,800 --> 03:05:25,600

And now, here is your fortune cookie message of the day.

2557
03:05:41,880 --> 03:05:47,880
Can you tell me how to get, how to get to Sesame Street?

2558
03:05:47,880 --> 03:05:54,880
How to get to Sesame Street? How to get to Sesame Street?

2559
03:05:55,880 --> 03:06:00,880
Hello, Hermit the Frog here, and welcome to Sesame Street.

2560
03:06:00,880 --> 03:06:08,880
I'd like to tell you what today's letter is, but I am really f***ed up.

2561
03:06:08,880 --> 03:06:12,880
Hey, Big Bird, do you know what today's letter is?

2562
03:06:12,880 --> 03:06:17,880
Sure, Kermit. Today's letter is...

2563
03:06:17,880 --> 03:06:19,880
joint.

2564
03:06:19,880 --> 03:06:25,880
Uh, Big Bird, joint is not a letter.

2565
03:06:25,880 --> 03:06:27,880
It is a word.

2566
03:06:27,880 --> 03:06:32,880
Sorry, kids. Today's letter is three.

2567
03:06:33,880 --> 03:06:37,880
Big Bird. Three is a number.

2568
03:06:38,880 --> 03:06:44,880
Exactly. The number three, which is how many joints I've smoked today.

2569
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:49,880
Kermit, are you with me?

2570
03:06:50,880 --> 03:06:52,880
Thank God I'm stoned.

2571
03:06:52,880 --> 03:06:54,880
Me too!

2572
03:06:57,880 --> 03:07:00,880
Guys! Guys! Show go on! Come on!

2573
03:07:01,880 --> 03:07:02,880
Thank you, Elmo.

2574
03:07:03,880 --> 03:07:06,880
How about we say our ABCs, Big Bird?

2575
03:07:07,880 --> 03:07:08,880
Okay.

2576
03:07:08,880 --> 03:07:27,880
A, B, C, D, E, F, R, G, Q, K, C, R, uh, C, E, I forgot what we were doing, Cramit.

2577
03:07:27,880 --> 03:07:30,880
Did you just call me Cramit?

2578
03:07:30,880 --> 03:07:32,880
Yes, I did.

2579
03:07:32,880 --> 03:07:34,880
Cramit the frog here.

2580
03:07:34,880 --> 03:07:43,200
okay okay that's all the time we have for today

2581
03:07:43,200 --> 03:07:46,240
