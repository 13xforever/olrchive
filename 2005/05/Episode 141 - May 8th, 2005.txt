DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
I should be in love without you in it.
They can't find the rules, like that's the way it's done, and that's the way it's done.
I'm watching the stories, I'm speaking at the end of my time, I'm making my time, and there's nothing left to do, to do that job, cause we have a big kitchen.
and many more.
Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh
Thanks for watching!
and many more.
Thank you.

Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
And this is episode number 141 for this May the 8th of 2005.
You're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio the gamers really want, and this is Orange Lounge Radio Live.
Your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com My name is Rob Roberts.
You might know me as Sky.
Joining me as always are my awesome co-hosts.
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm.
Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers.
You know her better as Dark Sakura.
I wouldn't say I'm the happiest bunny on the farm today, but I'm pretty damn happy.
You're kind of a... I'm the most carnivorous bunny on the farm.
Alright, fair enough.
I've been eating nothing but meat all day and I feel violent.
You're not going to hurt anything during this show, are you?
No, I'll wait until after the show.
You wouldn't hurt a ferret, would you?
Give me a ferret!
Hey, baby.
Also joining us, say hello to the one, the only, Loki.
Also remember, it's the most motherly, you know, read.
I was going to get there.
I was going to get there.
Hey, just saying.
I did that stuff yesterday because, you know, I don't want to interfere with today, you know, my sleeping and going to fries and whatnot.
Now, just
Take a moment to thank the womb where you were cooked.
You don't have to think about it that way if you don't want to.
Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have some special guests.
Say hello to somebody who was at the show a couple months ago, but he's back tonight.
Say hello to...
I don't know how to introduce you.
Toadie?
Pirate Power?
I don't know.
What do we call you?
You could call me... I guess go by Toadie because that's what I'm on on like all 70,000 forums I'm on.
Alright, Toadie.
How are you?
I think I'm getting sick.
Everybody I know is sick.
Get the hell away from me.
I'm a good four feet, so I think we're good.
I know.
We're in the news studio now, though, so it's all... I could reach out and hug everyone right now in this news studio.
You can check out the new webcam over at www.orange.com Of course, the only person you can see is me right now, but we'll try to get it around.
Also, say hello to, and there's a reason you're here tonight, Tony.
Yes.
And we're going to talk about that when we get into the show.
Sounds good.
I mean, we like having you here for no reason in particular, but tonight you have a very specific reason for being here.
Okay.
Yes.
I'll try not to let you down.
All right.
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Bug.
Hello.
And how are you, sir?
I'm doing great, sir.
Our resident tech geek bugged, because then when you get tech guru Loki and tech geek bugged in the same room, it's just, I don't know, it's just all... It's like a board collective.
Yeah, it's 20 degrees of dork in here right now.
Anyway, all sorts of interesting things we're going to talk about on tonight's show.
I got to check out that In The Groove premiere party, so I definitely want to talk about that, and of course the reason Toadie's here, he went to it too, so...
Unfortunately, DarkSakura and Loki were unable to make it, so somebody's going to be so unfortunate.
Well, we'll get into that later.
So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?
I've been on the fence for a long time.
So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?
And what do I think of the home version?
We'll see.
We'll see.
Also, so much news going on in the Mamani world.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Starting this break, I figured since we're going to be talking about Extreme 2 at some point tonight, we should play some music from the first DDR Extreme that was released in the US.
So here's some music, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
See you then.
Thanks for watching!
New Sky 2 Forever, the green grass blows and the wind is dancing
It would be a much better sight with you with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along
So now what should I do?
I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Glad they gave me everything you had and more You craved my happiness When you made me feel joy and made you smile
Thank you for watching!
I was into Cuba, now I'm stuck Diving, knowing it was you I keep on trying
Looking out a dirty old window Down below the cars in the city go rushing by I sit here alone and I wonder why Friday night and everyone I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down I saw
Thanks for watching!
Hi, we're back with Orange Lounge Radio.
In that break, you heard some Kids in America.
Before that, Four Strings with Diving.
Heather, You're Not Here, originally famous in Silent Hill 3, but then you got to dance to it.
And then Funk Boogie, all from DDR Extreme USA.
DarkSakra My week has been...
Interesting.
I've basically been in a lot of pain all week, but most of it doped up on Vicodin.
Woohoo!
And Flexerol.
Not woohoo for pain, but woohoo for Vicodin.
Yeah.
I've managed to go two days until today without taking any Vicodin.
And then I started to hurt really bad again, so I took some more.
But it was all just work, school crap.
I was going to go to the end of the group thing, and instead said that I can get out of my final, which is the first day of E3.
I gave up going to the in-the-group thing because my education is more important.
Listen to all of this.
Your education is more important than video games.
Ignorant people.
Well, now, what if you're going to go to one of those schools that you see in the G4 commercial that, you know, learn about how to play games for a living.
Games, games, games, games, games.
No comment.
Okay.
But...
What?
What?
What?
What?
and then went to Rapture, which was basically goth industrial and had a really good time.
I see a little bit of that reflected in your pre-show selections for this evening.
It was a little bit angsty.
No.
I wouldn't say angsty, but more it was tragic.
Your playlist was tragic.
I had some Britpop in there.
A little bit, but it was tragic Britpop.
How is it tragic?
I'm just messing with you.
I don't see how Pet Shop Boys gets very tragic.
Well, yeah, they do have some kind of angsty stuff.
Because a guy whines when he sings.
Anyway, I've been in a good mood since then, except Friday I heard back from the other guy's insurance company.
Well, that taxi cab company's insurance company.
Tried to call the stupid guy back because he left a message on my voicemail.
And this relates to your car accident from a couple weeks ago, for those who missed it.
and he never called me back.
He apparently never came back to his desk and I need the money so if they flat out refuse to pay me, I'm suing them.
I've already talked about getting an accident attorney.
And you know me, I will rip them.
Coming soon to Court TV.
Seriously.
But no, I'm going to give them... Take them on Judge Judy.
No.
See, I have this thing called A Sense of Pride.
Okay, how about Texas Justice?
Don't even go there.
Have you ever watched Texas Justice?
I don't watch TV.
Is that where the loser gets hanged?
I think they play it just before cops.
And you can just tell what the target audience is for this power hour.
Anyway, sorry.
No.
But I'm going to give him a fair opportunity.
I'm going to get a copy of the police report, have it full out.
There's no way they really can't pay me because he was fully at fault, you know, pulled out in front of me when I had the right of way.
I wasn't on my cell phone and my headlights were on so there's nothing they can do.
Ouch.
Yeah.
They didn't give me Vicodin, then they gave me Codeine.
That sounded like I was drunk for days.
But, um... But, uh... I had a lot of fun yesterday.
I completely went off my diet and had fish and chips, and then I had ice cream, and then went to Hot Topic.
I'm sorry, Instagoth.
To do some shopping.
Beer's... It was pretty good.
Cider.
Cider.
That's... What was that stuff called?
That apple cider.
That was, uh...
Blackthorn Dry Cider
and today I did my homework for my technical writing class I have to write a tutorial and actually the whole tutorial is not due for two weeks I have to review somebody else's tutorial but I'm just going to do everything at once but my tutorial is on how to make live journal icons using PaintShark Pro 8 are you going to post that on the interweb for anybody to see when it's done?
sure, why not I'm hopefully going to have it finished by the end of the week and I'll put it up on the web you can see my homework
and tomorrow I get to paint.
Cool.
I was supposed to do it today, but eh.
I went to bed at 4 a.m., sorry, 4.30 in the morning and got up at half past noon, so yeah.
Okay, done.
All right.
Let's move on to Loki.
Loki, sir, how was your week?
How was your day?
Put down the luminous.
Hey, okay, okay.
I'm getting further now that I actually have time to play.
No, my day was okay.
I went to Fry's to buy a bunch of supplies for my
We'll get into that stuff later.
Fry's rocks, but I try not to go there too much because I spend too much money.
And then I went to a movie this week.
I went and saw Kingdom of Heaven, and that was Kingdom of Boring.
It looked like Kingdom of Boring from the trailer.
I can't believe you actually went.
This was Father-Son time, so I went because he wanted to see the movie.
Did it have any true historical reference to it?
It did.
Apparently the fighting, everything but the fighting was accurate.
Okay, I have to see it.
But really, it's just like, it was like, I've never actually sat through a movie where I said, okay, is it over yet?
Because it just kept going and I really wanted it to end.
The battles were anticlimactic.
I mean, I can sense that Ridley Scott was trying to make it climactic, but it was just a
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Anything else is happening, you know.
My friend won free passes to see the Kingdom of Heaven.
She actually entered an amateur strip contest, and that was part of the prize that she won.
Go figure.
Poor bastard.
Is that punishment or something?
I don't know.
It was like, you should know better than taking your clothes off in public.
You have to go see Kingdom of Heaven.
I think I want to see it, though, just because I'm a big history nut.
You know, it's too bad.
She had those advanced screening passes, and she was like, I don't want to go.
So she tried to give them to me, and I was like, I don't want to go.
E3 Oh, that's fair.
Oh, I got a free game, another one, Area 51, and I have not played it.
and Contemplating Selling.
Yes, Area 51's been remade again, but this time it's not a shooting game, it's a first-person shooter.
Oh, just what we need, another first-person shooting game.
I'm so happy.
Oh, honestly, yeah, there's like so many goddamn first-person shooters out there, it's not even funny, but whatever.
So, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing, and just, you know, cleaning house and stuff.
Fun stuff.
I got to play Final Fantasy online the other day.
So it's finally.
Finally.
That's good.
I've been, like, having withdrawals.
Very cool.
All right.
Addict.
My week and my day was okay.
I was kind of busy this weekend because a friend of mine was in town.
And you know what's funny?
Because we went to GameStop the other night, and he had, like, $100 worth of credit that he could turn in to buy stuff.
He just had it lying around.
I don't know.
I don't know how you just happen to have $100 worth of credit just lying around.
Oh, look here.
But no, he decided he wanted to get a PSP.
And I was like, if you're going to get a PSP, you have to buy Luminous.
But I think he was kind of starting to realize that when you get a PSP, not only do you have to start buying the PSP, then you've got to buy a memory stick, then you've got to buy a game.
And it really starts to add up pretty quickly.
You're not going to throw down $250 when you first get a PSP.
You're going to end up throwing down more like $300 or $350.
So he decided he wanted to get Darkstalkers, and lucky him, he actually found a used PSP.
Somebody had just traded it in that morning, so he ended up getting one of those, so lucky him.
And it appeared to be in great shape, and it already had like a memory stick in it that was like 200-something megs, so it was kind of nice.
That's not bad.
You know the one gigs are supposed to be out at GameStop.
It was like about the best one you can get, so he got a really sweet deal on that.
But anyway, the point is that I was like, you have to play Luminous.
But he was like, I don't really have the money.
So I'm like, okay, you know what?
I'm going to get a PSP eventually.
I'm just going to buy Luminous.
So now I have a copy of Luminous with no system to play it on because he took it home with him.
So, oh well.
I figure I'll get a PSP eventually.
I just have to wait for the E3 stuff to settle down.
So we'll see what happens.
Otherwise, my week was just really busy with work.
I'm looking forward to next week and E3 and everything just so I can take my mind off my real job.
Not that I dislike my real job because I love my job, but
I'm looking forward to playing with this job for a little while.
It'll be fun.
And that's it.
I'll talk about the rest of my week in a little bit.
Let's talk to Toadie.
What's up with your week and your day?
Well, let's see.
First of all, I was driving around about half the day without my wallet.
That was really fun because I didn't know where the hell I left that.
I thought it might have been in some Mexican restaurant in like West Sacramento.
So that kind of freaked me out.
Oh, that place is good.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
So I was like, hell with that!
And you love children, right?
Roseville Golf Land teaches you how to be a real good babysitter.
Oh yes, yes.
I actually have a group of little kids down there that want to kick my ass.
It's really funny.
Children are fine with the proper preparation and sauces.
Yes.
Get some basil going on there.
Wait, wait, wait.
You have kids?
Well, okay, I say kids.
I think they're like 17 or 18, but they're like 5 feet tall.
Okay, okay.
I don't really know.
And they want to kick your ass?
Yes.
Did you fail them or something?
No.
Oh.
I don't know if it's because the Sacramento area is so anti-bar rape or not, and I'm like the biggest bar rapist in the entire area.
Big enough to be on a registry?
Yeah.
I think so.
I think I could get on Megan's Law for Bar Rapist.
Bugged, I know you're not too familiar with the DDR lingo, but when he says Bar Rapist, he doesn't mean that he goes into bars and rapes people.
He's talking about DDR.
Like you hold on to the bar.
I got that, ah, look.
At least now that you know about it anyway.
Keep it that way.
But that's about it for me.
Alright.
Bugged, how was your week?
How was your day?
I got to deal with Pepsi Corporate Office on Wednesday.
Very nice.
Yeah, they came out for a physical inventory.
My boss never showed.
The owner of the company never showed.
They were more pissed that they didn't show than we were like 400 cases off, which is .0015% deviance.
400 cases?
How many sodas are in a case?
There's 12 cans per case.
Oh, that's not too bad, I guess.
But still, wow.
Out of 272,000, 400 ain't crap, I think.
We ended up going up to Yuba City, In-N-Out, and the Rusty Duck.
That is good food.
What the hell is the Rusty Duck?
It's kind of like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos.
Or, well, it seems like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos, but it's got really good food.
Wow.
Okay.
And that was pretty much it.
I wore my Fugitive t-shirt yesterday, or Friday, whatever the hell that day was, to give my boss the bad news.
It says, Fugitive, you never saw me.
Drop the paperwork off and ran the fuck home.
Isn't it amazing what effect shirts can have on people's reactions to you?
I didn't tell them what it was all about.
Here's the paperwork.
Walked right on out and...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I changed one of my pictures on Myspace to actually one of the pictures from the Live 365 Awards where I'm wearing one of those shirts that says tough guys wear pink.
And it's one of, you know, it's this typical Hot Topic shirt.
And I swear to God, like the day after I changed my picture, the next day I logged on and like 15 girls had all sent me a friend request.
And none of them were over 18.
Lucky bastard.
What?
Lucky bastard.
You like him young, huh?
Damn right.
If I wanted to be like a, you know,
and Pedophilia Act or whatever they call them, Child Molester, MySpace would be heaven.
It's great.
Honestly, seriously.
So if that's what you're into as underage girls, just dress metrosexual and sign up for MySpace.
I got it covered.
You've got the metrosexual thing down.
How many friend requests from little girls do you get on MySpace?
Well, see, everybody lies about their age, so you can't tell.
So if they're 19, 16, you take off three years every single time.
About three years is around.
Yeah.
All right.
I don't lie on my age, but... I don't either, but... I mean, I just think it's funny, but I actually accepted all their frame requests because then they all leave me comments going, Oh, thanks for adding me!
Oh, yeah.
And I'm like, Oh, that makes my ego feel good.
Yeah, I'm like, I'm a MySpace friends whore.
I'll just add, like, random people.
I don't know who they are.
I don't really care either.
It's like, I'm not actually on there to meet people, you know?
My sister on MySpace has a thousand friends.
One thousand friends.
Damn.
I'm like...
Freezepop
has the thing on MySpace.
I have Mr. T on mine.
Mr. T. I love how they have, like, the really crap, like, you can have people randomly leave, like, clips of video and stuff.
And images.
I do that all the time.
I leave images on people's journals.
It's fun.
But, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the worst, is my sister, because she has a thousand friends, if you load up her page, there's five videos that play all at the same time.
Oof.
and one of them is like a bum begging for money and the other one's like a skateboarding video.
Yeah, it's like bum fights or something.
Nice.
And the other one's like a skateboarding video and then some death rock song.
MySpace is where the internet goes to die.
It really is.
But sometimes you just want to feel cheap.
Yeah.
I don't know what the allure of MySpace is because really... Everybody has one.
It's an ugly site.
There's no point to MySpace, really.
But...
yet I feel strangely attracted to it.
It's like the Fox Network.
That was low.
I don't know how to explain it.
Speaking of Fox Network, Family Guy in an Hour?
Don't tell people that because then they'll turn this show off to go listen to it.
That's why there's TiVo.
That's why you have TiVo and why you have BitTorrent.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
MySpace, yeah.
End of story.
Enough said.
Notice how Orange Lounge does not have a community on MySpace.
We have a community on just about every other website out there, but we do not have one on MySpace.
Although, I think Jamie had hinted about starting one.
I'm planning on doing that since I actually have some free time to do that.
Now, I'm surprised that you're on MySpace.
Aren't you?
I joined it for some gorillas thing.
Yeah, but have you actually looked at some of the other people's profiles on there?
Oh, scary.
Let me send you my sister's page.
But, you know what?
I barely look at it, only when I remember to.
Thank you for watching!
But, Geocities, man, hosted some ugly ass websites.
I mean, seriously.
And it would be like, you know, page dedicated to Britney Spears and it has like the MIDI file embedded in the page.
No, let's see.
Hey, you guys should see if my page is still up.
It's www.geocities.com slash nightmare underscore hunter.
And then...
Do you have many files embedded in your page?
No, but I had a page dedicated to stupid people and how I hated them.
Oh, now I have to look.
I had stories.
Geocities.com My friend on the East Coast just recently made a page dedicated to her new car.
This is Geocities for you.
She actually made the font color match her car.
Anyway, so it's Nightmare underscore Hunter?
Yeah.
Let me see if I can find it.
I know this is great radio.
I don't even know if it's still up anymore.
I used to have a Lemmings page too.
Yep, there it is.
Oh my god, it's really there.
Wow.
Oh, this is great.
Last update, September 26th, 01.
Added DDR page.
Let's see what links he has on the DDR page.
I had sim files at the time.
You have a Club Tropicana DWI and a Quake 2 theme DWI.
And then this is great, and you see this shit on Geocities pages all the time.
Links to BMS files.
Nothing under it.
That's because I erased them.
Where's the stupid people page?
Encounters with stupid people.
Let's see.
Warning, the following are actual encounters with actual stupid people.
August 25th, Saturday.
Location, Roseville Galleria Electronics Boutique.
Case name, Stupid Clerk.
It was Saturday in the late afternoon.
I'd never been to the Galleria before, so I thought, what the hell?
I was looking for a Dex drive for my PlayStation so that I could upload my PlayStation saves to this site.
Anyways, I found this third-party device called the MP Exchanger.
So I walk up to the counter to pay, and I was greeted with stupidity.
Here's an approximate dialogue of the conversation.
Clerk, so you find everything alright?
Looks down at my purchase.
Me, yeah.
Clerk, man, I was waiting for this thing to sell.
I have no idea why anyone would need this for.
I have no idea how it works or if it works.
Me, it copies game saves to your PC off a memory card.
Clerk, okay, would you like to buy insurance in case you break it within a year?
No!
Clerk, giggles.
Okay, that'll be $5,000.
Giggles.
Me...
Me, looks at the cash register display then hands the moron the correct amount of money, $29.95.
Clerk, hands me the receipt.
Let me know if that thing works.
Me, walking out of the store.
Whatever.
How old were you when you wrote this?
21, probably?
Yeah.
Whatever!
I don't think I actually went like that, but, you know.
Well, that's what you put, whatever.
Moral of the story, and by the way, moral is M-O-R-A-L-E.
Okay, I was, you know, I don't care.
Morale?
No, wait, no, I'm kidding.
Never mind, I'm thinking something else.
When you see it in all fables, it's always morale of the story.
I swear to God, that's what you see.
No.
I swear, like, I had books, and that's what it said.
Never mind, forget it.
Ugh.
Moral of the story, when dealing with the I think I'm funny clerk type, it's best to just ignore any attempt they make to make you laugh.
Failure to do so will only prolong the torture.
That's wonderful advice.
The more you know.
Okay, anyway.
The other one on there is some stupid guy at Burger King or like McDonald's or something.
Sigh.
Well, if you want to check that out, you can visit his old website there.
It's fucking great.
Anyway, it sucks.
I want to see what other sites you have linked on here.
I want to see what the cool sites were to visit back in 2001.
I don't think I have any links.
Oh, you don't have a links page.
Everybody had a links page.
I didn't have a links page.
You have a WhoAmI.
Your birth date on here, by the way, is listed as 9-11-01.
Good job.
I didn't want them to know how old I was.
And that's 01.
I'm like, you know, a hundred-some years old, man.
I'm fucking awesome.
Alright.
Mine's still floating around somewhere on the internet, although GeoCities finally deleted it.
But I have DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine.
I saw that years ago.
That was me.
That's funny.
And then I had two, uh, a Best of Move and a Best of Move 2 site.
They're actually still up on the anime web turnpike.
you know what's funny is all these people in our chat room right now over at www.orangehunter.com they're all looking up their Geocities pages right now and all I see in the chat room right now is this OMG my site's still up OMG OMG I can't believe it's still there I haven't updated my site in like four years I'm surprised that's even up that's great alright
Cody, by the way, your girlfriend is in chat and wants to know that your girlfriend's listening.
Uh, yeah, I also just got a text a second ago that said, Bad Andrew, yes, I'm listening.
And I'm just like, oh, shit.
Uh-oh.
Yeah, gotta watch what I say.
He didn't mean anything by the underage girl thing.
Yeah.
It's all underage boys.
I'm kidding.
Wait, wait, wait.
Uh...
Anyway, Toadie, as long as you have the microphone, let's talk about our fabulous party we went to.
What night was it?
Wednesday, Tuesday?
Wednesday night.
So how did you get hooked up with this?
We went to our very first video game premiere, and it was for In the Groove, the new dancing game coming out on PlayStation 2.
The controversial dancing game, I guess I really should say, because it seems like the dance game community is really divided over this In the Groove game.
If you've been living under a rock...
in the groove is this game that was created by and I think it's fair to say fans of the DDR series are folks that made this game but what they wanted to do was kind of improve on what they felt DDR was lacking on but it's in no way like DDR ever
No way at all.
But it's a completely different game, even though it has four arrows that scroll up that you dance to.
In DDR machines, mind you, the upgrade, it's nothing like DDR.
It's Mario versus, that's the greatest argument I read, is that DDR versus in the group, it's like Mario versus Sonic.
Oh, yikes.
You don't put a new sticker on your Nintendo case and suddenly turn it into Sonic.
But that's another story, forget it.
Despite how you feel about the game.
We got to go to this party, and you got hooked up through ITG Freak?
I got up ITG Freak, yeah.
And DDR Freak was kind enough to hook us up with passes, because we don't count as a legitimate media source in the industry or something.
It's a shame.
We haven't really worked with Red Octane in the past.
I don't even think they know who we are, so it's cool.
Actually, they do know who we are, because they offered us a partnership deal a few years ago when I was hosting Shaft.
How did I miss that?
I think we tried to do the whole Red Octane thing out of the head.
They know about us now.
Some of them might be listening even.
Hi, Red Octane.
Hi.
Anyway.
I swear we're not going to bash this game.
Anyway, no.
I have things to say about it, but I'll ask Tony first.
How was your drive down, and what did you think when you got there?
Well, we would have been on time, but, you know, hour of traffic.
And then when we actually got to San Francisco, we were like, oh, hey, look, it's the Fifth Street Garage.
So we ended up going down ten blocks because there were no left turns on any of them and down about another five streets and another ten blocks back to get to the parking garage.
That was a pain in the ass.
And then we were, I hope this guy's not listening, but there was this creepy-ass guy that just, like, approached me and my guest as we were walking up
and just started asking us about music fees and royalties and how much he should charge Red Octane and stuff like that for his music.
And it's like, get away from me.
I don't know you.
Please don't touch me.
You know what?
There might be a reason for that.
It has to do with something else Red Octane mentioned this week.
I'll get to that in a minute.
I was very confused.
And he gave me his phone number when he left, which made me even more confused.
Hot.
Grant, call him!
Grant, call him!
You want to call him right now?
I should have brought it.
You want to call him right now on the show?
No.
I wish I brought it with me, you know, but... Alright.
Alright, well, okay, so you got there, and what did you think when you got to the thing?
Well, the place was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I think they were honestly expecting a lot more people to show up.
I was actually surprised that there weren't as many people as I thought.
Don't get me wrong, I kind of liked it that way.
It was a really nice vibe there.
I didn't really personally know a lot of people there.
I did run into a few people in the scene, such as yourself and a couple of people from other websites.
Believe it or not, even though we're all quote-unquote competing websites, we all sit down and have drinks.
It's fun.
And good people that run the other websites in the community.
But if you think about it, like, DDR Freak had 10 passes to give away, but Monty Stone had 10 passes to give away, and the group Freak had 10 passes to give away, and if they all bring a guest, that's 60 people right there.
There was maybe 60 people in the entire place.
I know, I kind of was like, wow, and Red Octane had a lot of people there.
Yeah.
Like, most of the people there were from Red Octane, it seemed, or some type of press or something.
Well, if I can rant here for a second.
Sure.
This is something I saw on DDR Freak anyway.
What I kept seeing was all these, like, 15-year-olds...
Why won't they let me in?
Why won't they just let us have a pass that doesn't let us have alcohol or something like that?
It's like, well, you're completely missing the point of what this is.
The employees want to go down there and just get fucking wasted.
You know, they just, we completed a game, we're going to have a party, and they don't want to have to deal with 15-year-olds.
I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, that's... I talked to a bunch of Red Octane employees there.
You know what?
I'm kind of...
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
One of the rotten apples would get in there and fuck it all up.
Not to say that everybody over 21 is perfect, but luckily we lucked out.
Everybody there was very cool.
I didn't run into anybody I disliked.
And trust me, there's people over 21 that are stupid that I'm glad stayed far away from this.
But I think there's just a certain maturity level expectation.
And that's just the way life is.
I'm sorry to say it.
But someday you will have this conversation with...
Other teenagers.
So, you know, I don't know what else to say.
Yeah, more than anything else, I mean, there were so many Red Octane and Rockstar employees there.
I mean, it was basically a party for them, not really for the fans of the game, so... Yeah, that's what I thought was also interesting about this.
The party really wasn't for hardcore in-the-groove players.
I think that was the number one misconception about this, was that, oh, it was going to be the best of the best in-the-groove players showing off this game.
Whereas, in fact...
Most people were just average.
Tony was probably one of the best players there, and there was only a handful.
I could probably count them on one hand, how many 10, 11, 12 foot players were at this thing.
I mean, when people are looking at me and going, this guy is good, come on.
Oh, you got moves.
I've seen them.
So, yeah, so what I loved about it, though, is that there was an open bar, and the club was very posh.
It was nice.
Honestly, these guys know how to throw a party.
Oh, I agree.
Despite how you may feel about In the Groove, the party was awesome.
That was brilliant.
Free sushi, all that stuff.
Oh, my gosh.
Drink all night.
In the Groove totally knows... I'm sorry, Red Octane.
Stop rubbing it in.
Sorry.
Red Octane totally knows how to buy my love.
Honestly.
Oh yeah, I had a great time.
If they could buy off my opinion on this game, this would have been a great party to do it.
It would have been Driver 3.
What?
If they could buy off your opinion on this game, that game would have been Driver 3?
Yeah, I would have been giving Driver 3 reviews of the game.
But okay, as far as the feelings for the game myself.
Okay, so I got to check out the home version of In the Groove on PlayStation 2.
And as you guys know, I've always been... And when I first reviewed In the Groove, this is what I said about it.
It's not as bad as the people who are saying In the Groove should die and go away is saying.
It's not that bad.
But it's not as good as what the people who are saying OMG, DDR is dead forever, ITG for life is saying.
It's somewhere in the middle.
That is how I still feel about this game even after seeing it at the show.
I was actually...
More impressed, I didn't think the game would translate as well to the PlayStation 2 as it did.
Because you have to consider that a lot of this game was kind of homebrew, really.
Step Mania was a homebrew thing, and it kind of evolved from that, right?
So a lot of this game was homebrew.
It actually translates very well and very smoothly into a PlayStation 2 game, so I was pretty impressed with that.
as far as the game itself though it's it's it's in the groove you already have an opinion on this game honestly there's nothing I'm gonna say that's gonna change your mind one way or the other if you've played in the groove in the arcade you like it you're gonna like the home release if you don't like it you're not gonna like it so I I would recommend in the groove to dance game fans but I still would say if it's your first game
I don't know, you may want to weigh your options a little bit.
I think DDR has some more beginner accessible things.
I think in the groove is always going to be more for the hardcore niche player.
That's my... Actually, the home version actually added a new training slash beginners mode that's not available in the arcade.
Right, right.
I did notice that, but I was still... I don't know, it's still... I don't know what it is.
In the groove, it just doesn't have that...
DarkSakura
I mean, and I know that might sound a little bit belittling, but it really is kind of a compliment that it is actually holding my attention for a new DDR.
Because, you know, it's unfortunate that Konami has kind of slowed down on the arcade stuff at least.
But this home version is a whole other world.
We're going to get into later in the show.
This is going to be a huge year for Dance Game.
That is now four Dance Games.
After this week, we know for sure there are four dance games coming out this year, and they all want your attention.
But honestly, most people that listen to this show are going to buy all four anyway.
I think.
I don't know.
Probably.
Probably.
The biggest compliment that I had of the game, and I really want to credit Red Octane for doing this, is that they kept the timing windows in the game the same as the arcade.
Yeah, that was cool.
That is my absolute biggest criticism whatsoever of all the home versions for DDR games, because you actually get used to playing on those and you go to the arcade and you just suck.
You know, you're terrible.
You're just off by a couple milliseconds and you start great attacking everything.
And you're like, what the hell's going on?
At home, I'm triple A-ing this.
So I'm really, really glad that they kept that the same.
It's actually going to be able to improve your ability in the arcade.
I'll tell you one thing I really liked, and this was something that really surprised me about the party, because I did not think I would be as impressed by this as I was, was Red Octane's Metal Pad.
Yes, I was wondering if you were going to cover the Afterburner.
The Afterburner is amazing.
I thought it was, it's great.
It's the best Metal Pad I've played on.
But of course, I haven't played on that many.
But it's the best.
It's so responsive.
It's smooth.
It's great.
Well, I own two personalized Cobalt Fluxes, and I can easily say that I would rather have two Afterburners.
Do you know the other thing I noticed about the Afterburners, which is awesome, the way they lock together?
So you can kind of play doubles with the pads locked together.
The only thing the Afterburner is missing, seriously, is a bar.
Yes, I was actually talking to a guy named Atma, who works for Red Octane, and they actually have development going on for that.
I don't know if it'll actually go through or not, but I was offering some suggestions, of course, because it's the bar.
Right, right.
Now, and you can't play these games without the bar, as you found out.
It's quite difficult for me.
And that's going to be a problem for this game coming home, but interesting creative solutions.
Now, you tried something.
It didn't work too well.
I tried.
What did you try to do as a bar replacement at the party?
Well, since I didn't really have any chairs there, I basically just grabbed one of these metal bar stools.
I saw my ass on the picture gallery multiple times.
Yes, DarkSakura.
I was in the other room at that moment, but I heard Afterburner.
Not only are they ripping off DDR, now they're ripping off Sega.
Okay, well, well, well, wait.
I think we all know that this is not... The new Afterburner pad has nothing to do with everybody's favorite jet-flying game.
No, I know.
I know, but this just makes me want to hook up my 32X.
I know, you're teasing.
But the Afterburner pads, honestly, I was more impressed with the Afterburner pads than anything else in the show.
I thought they were great.
Yeah, is that the first metal pad that really has a system of, like, the depressed arrows like the Arcade?
I know the Cobalt Flux is completely flat, and I've had, like, a MyMyBox, which was pretty much flat also.
I'm going to ask our expert here, because I don't know, really.
Your pads that you built had it.
My pads rock, that's why, because I put my hard, you know...
I put a lot of hard effort into getting them, well, built.
Working, it's a little different.
But my pads rock.
They weigh a ton.
But as far as depressors, most of them are like flat and they're lame.
Like, I remember those old metal pads you can get off of eBay or whatever.
I don't even remember where I bought metal pads from.
I ended up selling them to someone and the first time I stepped on it, it bent.
I'm like,
Why did it bend?
That's weird.
Because it's made of tinfoil.
I'm sorry if I sound like I was knocking your metal pads, Loki, but these pads actually worked for more than 15 minutes.
Because mine aren't groundy, you dumbass.
Shit.
Once I put that wire on, man, those fucking pads are going to rock.
Dude, but these pads at the show, they were taking abuse.
I saw girls in heels playing on these pads.
They were taking a lot of abuse, and they were still holding up great.
Stupid women.
Stop it!
DDR is dead!
If you still play DDR, you're a fag!
Thank you for watching!
I don't care how you spin it.
In the Groove is a deviation of the DDR game.
You cannot spin this any other way that I will believe you that this is not some type of at least inspired by DDR.
You cannot spin it.
Had there been no DDR, there would be no In the Groove.
Absolutely.
Period.
End of sentence.
That sums it up there.
And these kids out there that are just
saying, you know, DDR is dead, have no respect for where In The Groove came from.
Hello, DDR fans, build In The Groove!
I'm done.
And they also built stupid, uh, what was it, that dancing stage, um, Unleashed or whatever.
Oh, well, stupid Konami, they can't get anything right as far as, like, you know, the new, uh, arcade games.
I mean, I swear, you know,
I don't know.
I'm really curious to see what they're going to come up with for this year's E3.
EyeToy.
That was a great idea.
Let's do that again.
You know what?
I think people were way too harsh on the EyeToy thing.
Oh, yeah.
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold on.
Hold on a minute.
I don't want to get too far off topic here.
I'm not done within the groove yet.
But the EyeToy thing, look at it this way.
For those of us that are into DDR and all that stuff, it was kind of silly.
But let's face it, DDR was not just made for us.
It was also made for nine-year-old girls to have at their slumber parties.
Like it or not.
And this is a topic I'm going to bring back later when we start talking about Xtreme 2.
Nine-year-old girls in their slumber parties think this iToy shit's hilarious.
Not that I know firsthand.
I've just, you know, heard things and read about them on certain internet websites.
iToy was not made for you.
It was not made for you, the fan.
It was made to make DDR more accessible and more showy and flashy.
And that's why DDR does so well, because it's such a showy, flashy game.
And that's something that In the Groove, by the way, completely lacks, is showiness and flashiness.
In the Groove looks like this industrial, sad, sad, gothic thing.
Not to knock the game quality, because it's a fun game, but it looks bad.
It looks too American.
Yeah, sadly, it looks too American.
Anyway.
Yeah, because I love the eye toy game where you hit the stupid ball around and you spend like 15 minutes trying to get the ball to go where you want it to go and it sucks and it's so frustrating.
I'm already pissed off at Sonic Team for not doing a real Knights game and instead doing Knights in that eye toy collection.
What?
Yeah, I remember that Sega collection thing that they were doing the eye toy with at E3.
Uh-huh.
Well, there's a Knights game in it.
Why couldn't they just make Knights?
I'm sorry, I had to rant about iToy.
Yeah, why couldn't they just freaking make Samba on PS2?
Dude, Sonic Team just needs to be given a whole shitload of money and do nothing but make games that I tell them to.
Okay, and of course we have somebody in our chatroom right now that says, SSJ100Matt says, iToy games equal great games to play with your penis.
You always know somebody's gotta be the jokester.
Ass!
Alright, that'll make that work.
Back to In The Groove.
I know.
Back to In the Groove for a minute, alright, before we get on all these other tangents.
Alright, so In the Groove.
Do I recommend the game?
If you like In the Groove, yes.
If you don't know how you feel about it, at least check it out.
Form your own opinion.
Don't listen to people on the internet.
That is my opinion on In the Groove.
Don't listen to people on the internet.
Play the game for yourself and form your own opinion.
There it is.
Honestly, you know what this is right here?
Okay, this is the equivalent of, like, say...
Okay, you've got, you know, like your hair care products and stuff like that, okay, and you've got, you know, for women they have their conditioner and stuff, and then, you know, guys won't buy that crap because they're like, that's gay, I'm not gonna play that, I'm not gonna put that gay shit in my hair, so then they come up with like something cool, EXTREME GEL!
Okay, so you buy this extreme gel.
It's basically the same damn thing as the women's product, but repackaged, so you buy it.
This is what In The Groove is.
In The Groove is the Dance Dance Revolution game that you can play and not feel gay about.
That's what it is.
That is quite possibly the best analogy for this whole damn thing I've ever heard in my entire life.
Congratulations.
Hats off to you.
People should post that on every forum.
That's all it is.
That's really what it is.
You better copyright that.
You better copyright it.
It's the men's suave of the dancing world.
It's pH balance for a guy.
Exactly, they have that crap now.
pH balance for my ass.
If it wasn't pH balance, you know, just put that shit on.
Oh my god, it burns!
Anyways, yeah.
Toadie, your thoughts.
Well, I've already kind of been an ITG fanboy.
I mean, the first time I played it, I really thought it was pretty much just gimmicky bullshit.
You know, I'm like, mines, you know, what the fuck is this?
Who cares, you know?
I actually tried to do my first hand plant the other day.
I will never do that again.
I burst a couple veins in my hand.
I threw out my back.
All right.
But, I mean, the more I played it, the more I liked it.
And, like I said, they're not making any more DDR, so, I mean, I'm going to keep playing it.
But, I mean, I was impressed with the home version.
They got some stuff from ITG2 on here, so it should be pretty good.
They didn't fuck with the timing windows, so I'm happy.
I got it pre-ordered.
You know what, I'm going to pick it up.
My opinion of In the Groove is, even though I say I'm on the fence, it's favorable.
I think it's only going to be like $30, so I'm going to pick it up.
Why not?
The DDR games aren't going to be out until fall.
I'm going to pick up these games.
I think most people will.
I will soon, jerk.
RedOctane
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Hit me up offline and I'll give you the address.
But that rumor as it stands is completely false.
We got shirts and keychains and other cute little things.
Lots of beer.
And alcohol, which was great.
Like I said, Red Octane, No South Road Party.
I thought that bar was very cool.
I loved how we took over the media room at one point towards the end of the evening.
I had a great time.
Met some good people.
Honestly, I think what this did, it made me a little more favorable of the In The Groove community as a whole because I know now that there are good people around.
I think between that and the news that Red Octane came out with later in the week, I'm actually really respecting what Red Octane's trying to do.
RedOctane
Anyway, for now, I think what we'll do is we'll do a little bit of a break.
Oh, actually, I want to respond to some chatroom comments before we get a break.
One thing somebody said, Kuwabara, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, said, I don't feel gay when I play DDR.
Well, you know, okay.
And that's true, you shouldn't, because dance games do not have a sexuality.
I think Loki's comment, though, you have to remember, is more towards what the general public views these games as.
We, as you folks who are geeky enough to tune into a music station that is towards these dance games, and, you know, us in the community, we know it's not gay, and we know, we have fun with it, but you have to remember, the average, you know, Joe Q. Jock guy that comes to an arcade,
R.V.G.O.
Yeah, but they don't exactly call you queer.
But no, but they still get up and act asshole-ish on the machine.
So, my favorite circumstance is when I went up to these guys and said, Okay, I'll pay.
But I picked the songs.
And what was it that I picked?
It was something fairly vicious, What Rhythm And Police.
Yeah, it was something pretty mean.
Yeah.
It was cool.
And they just stopped there and went, Ugh.
I won't challenge anybody unless it's for like $40 a game.
I'm like, don't waste my time.
You want to play a five-time tournament winner?
$40 a game, asshole.
That's what you're doing.
I'm not wasting my time with you.
But my whole point with this was that I showed them just exactly how stupid they were being.
Yeah, it's great.
And then usually those other people that they get up and do that, I have them kicked out of the arcade.
You made a kid cry once.
That was the most beautiful thing ever.
It wasn't just you, but everybody.
Because you did something, and then we all gathered around, and we were like, yeah, do it, do it, do it, you stupid kid, do it.
And he ran off into the bathroom, and you know he was crying.
Well, like, when we were playing Pot of Potta, those people who were getting back there, and the one that knocked me in the shoulder, you know, doing fake whatever, I had, like, seven people kicked out of the arcade that night.
Wow.
I used to be, until I stopped, because I stopped going right after that, I used to have people kicked out of the arcade every time I was there because I wouldn't stand for it.
I would not stand to go into an arcade and see people acting like complete stupid idiots when the whole purpose of going to an arcade is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.
Yeah.
All right.
All right.
Anyway, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break because we've been sitting here for a while dishing on In The Groove.
We're going to come back and we're going to talk about now what Konami's up to because everything has just hit the fan this week.
It was seriously like you could see the tumbleweed flying across, you know, the Bomani scene has been dead and now just seriously, like over the weekend, bam, it all hit.
So we're going to talk about what now Konami's up to right after this break.
In this break, since we've been talking a little bit about In The Groove, I figured I'd humor the In The Groove fans with some music from In The Groove.
And in case you haven't actually played the game, you can hear what some of the music sounds like.
So we're going to start it off with some Nina with Fly With Me, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.
Thank you for watching!

Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.
Actually, now, Konami's kind of been trying to keep secrets about what they're going to be doing at... Oh, never mind, I thought you guys were talking to me.
They've been trying to keep quiet about some of the things they're going to be doing at E3.
You know, they like to surprise us.
I think in Konami's list... If they were trying to be quiet about it, why did they give it to GamePro?
Let me get there for a minute, damn you.
Alright.
So, usually, you know, they don't announce their stuff until it's getting closer to E3 time and, you know, they save most of their stuff for the show.
But this year, some of the stuff's gotten out early.
What's that?
IGN already blew the lid on the DDR with Mario is definitely going to be showing up.
And Karaoke Revolution 4.
And they also blew the lid on Karaoke Revolution 4.
and now what happened this week is that GamePro magazine, their website... Remember last year?
Yeah, I know.
That happened last year too.
Shame, shame.
Well, they spoiled all the unlocks on DDR Extreme last year.
And now what they did this year is they actually blew the lid on...
Some big things going on.
They actually have Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2.
And some very observant observers over on DDRFreak.com actually found these while they were surfing through GamePro's site.
So the first one that we have details leaked on was Ultramix 3.
Now again, I think most people assumed both these games were going to be coming.
Thanks for watching!
So I think Ultramix 3 especially are very curious to see what's going to happen with that.
So on the GamePro article, basically it reveals that there will be over 100 minutes of energetic dance music, and it's going to have over 65 songs, and I'm assuming that the downloads will still be accessible as well.
In fact, it does say it's compatible with all previous download song packs from DDR and DDR Ultramix 2, so that's 60 more songs right there, so that's 125 songs if you already have all these packs.
from the start.
Here are some of the new modes they're going to have in DDR Ultimix 3.
Freestyle mode.
And that will allow you to dance just the way you want to to any song in the game while rewarding you for doing different combinations.
It's like a freestyle mode.
So I think that just means you get to dance with no arrows, but maybe, I don't know if it's like a recording mode or it's rewarding you for doing certain things.
Like I think that's the impression I'm getting from it is that if you do certain step combos during it, you get rewarded.
Interesting, huh?
Yeah, no idea.
We can't really tell from the names alone, but that's pretty much all the article gives us right there.
So, there was that.
And, let's see.
Also, there's going to have quest mode.
Quest mode is basically, it's like a story mode now for DDR.
So, DDR is now getting... Yes, Toadie?
No, continue.
Quest mode, basically now... Yes?
Didn't they do this with Dance, Dance, Dance?
Yes.
Yeah, but how many people in this area know what that is?
I mean, seriously, how many people in the scene know what Dance Dance Dance is, even?
It was a really crappy game.
But now it's getting this quest mode.
You can travel virtually from city to city and build the ultimate dance team by completing challenging songs and routines along the way.
So it's basically a quest mode for DDR, like a story mode.
It's Pokemon DDR!
It's You Got Served the game.
Wow.
That makes me sad.
You know what, though?
It's cute, I guess.
I mean, it's cute.
I'm jaded, though, but...

There's a whole library of dancing characters out there that haven't really been on the Xbox yet.
So I'm thinking maybe putting two and two together, that's probably what Story Mode is going to encompass is more of those characters.
And I'm hoping more original characters.
And I'm really, really hoping, because this is Konami of Hawaii, we will finally see the DDR PC characters cross over onto console.
And that's right.
They need to travel to San Francisco in Quest Mode and meet Betty and Mr. Spanky.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Jukebox Mode is another mode that's going to be in this game.
Jukebox Mode, this is a quote from the article, Jukebox Mode turns your Xbox into a music machine, allowing players to enjoy more than 65 tracks from the game.
Whatever.
It kind of sounds like a throwaway mode, but, well, you know, with DDR having the full screen videos and everything, maybe there will be more full screen videos in Ultramix, because there's only been like one video in each game.
We had to do that thing, which was...
Really, really homoerotic, by the way.
And then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja and Ultramix 2.
So hopefully there'll be more actual videos.
Even if not, think about it, 2DX6 style had a mode like this.
And it was well-received, so maybe there'll be something like that.
So we'll see.
Of course there will be workout mode and of course edit mode and we're just going to assume here and assume that it still has the be able to upload your own steps because it does say you can't upload content so we are assuming that to mean that you get to do your own steps again as well as online tournaments and Xbox Live Play.
So any thoughts on Ultramix 3?
Things that Ultramix 3 needs that Ultramix 2 and 1 didn't have?
It needs a Pocari Sweat Dispenser.
Come on, realistically.
Maybe in story mode you might see it.
You know, it's hard to think of new and innovative things to do with DDR in general.
Except they need freaking dance magic.
I want a first-person shooter minigame in this because every game should have a first-person shooter aspect to it.
Well, maybe in quest mode there'll be a, you know... I'm going to throw arrows at you.
Konami should take a cue from Namco.
You know, your loading screens, you can play little, you know, old Konami games.
You could play Gradius.
I was freaking playing the hell out of Starblade on the Tekken 5.
You could totally do Pac-Man or something on that pad.
You know, um... But that's more midway.
Ultramix had some real shitloading times, too, in the very beginning.
It takes forever for the game to boot.
And I don't know if it's because you go through, like, five copyright screens before you finally get to the actual game.
They're not all copyrighted, but you get one copyrighted screen, one screen that says Bomani, one screen that says all this garbage.
Like Yaya Kung Fu and Super Konami World and Castlevania.
Here's my thing, though, with Ultramix 3 is that I really, really, really hope they keep up their relationship with a different drummer.
and I've been saying this every place I possibly can because I really want to see this happen because I think the different drum music that we had in Ultramix 2 was seriously like the best thing to happen to DDR since DDR I don't know it was the best so I really hope they are going to continue that relationship with a different drum or at least even if not that label specifically that whole idea of finding independent musicians who make just as damn good music as anybody else and put it in the game to make big honestly
You know, honestly, I just forgot what I was going to say.
Okay.
I was sort of just, it's trying to wrap my mind around a whole, I guess, RPG mode in a DDR game.
I still have flashbacks to Dance Dance Dance, and that game was horrible.
This is going to suck.
And now I believe Ultramix 2 is the best home release we've had on any system, period.
And it kind of stank at E3 last year.
So it's going to be interesting to see exactly how much we get to see this year at E3.
I don't know.
We'll see.
and also, you know, another good thing that Ultramix has been pretty good on is providing us with new, like, 10s for those folks that like the challenge and just, you know, and I'm looking at you, Toadie, the people that just can't enjoy DDR without there being 10-footers in it.
Well, it's not that I can't enjoy it, it's the fact that you'll come out with some new song and you'll make it a 7-footer.
I mean, during, I was with Loki when we were testing out DDR Extreme US and I think it was...
And I think I AAA'd like half of the new songs on the first try with the bigger timing windows and I'm like, okay, now what?
What am I going to do with this?
Add a challenge difficulty or something.
I mean, you have four difficulties to work with.
You can make one of those difficult to suit everybody.
You have to remember, though, Tony, on the bell of players that these games are made to, you could imagine it on a graph that looks like an upside-down U, a bell curve.
You are way on the bottom over here.
You are one of the few that they need to cater to.
Just make a challenge difficulty.
It's
I'll design the damn steps myself.
I mean, come on.
There's more than enough people that would be willing to do it.
You know?
You have four difficulties or whatever.
Just make one hard one.
We'll see.
We'll see.
Anyway, so we will see what happens with quest mode a little later on.
Of course, as we get more details, we'll post it to our website, orangelaundry.com.
DDR Freak as well.
They've got lots and lots of news on this stuff.
And all the other sites out there, I'm sure, are reporting on this as well.
Speaking of DDR Freak, I want to mention this at some point during the show.
Friday nights...
on DDR Freak Radio are actually replays of this show.
So to those of you guys who are actually hearing this the first time on Friday Night DDR Freak, hello, and thanks for listening.
So check that out over on The Freak, as we so lovingly call it here on this show.
Anything else on Ultramix you guys want to add in?
Okay.
We're going to talk about Extreme 2, but first we're going to have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.
We've got to get to that at some point tonight.
Can you believe how fast this show is going by tonight?
This is what happens when you actually have news to talk about.
Midnight Tune 2 or something like that.
It's some arcade racing game, and it was Nothing Lives Forever.
Starring Paul O'Terry, and it was a guy that did the music from Act Raiders.
Alright, sounds good.
Okay, so we're going to play a clip from this one because it was last week's winner.
And then it's going to go up against two brand new songs.
And you guys, in our chatroom, get to vote.
www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat to join the chatroom.
You guys vote for your favorite.
And the winning song goes into rotation all week long.
This one's been sitting here for a long time.
Thank you for watching!
I am the reacher What you need?
Alright, that was a clip there of song number one.
That was Politary, Nothing Lives Forever.
Alright, song number two is my song tonight.
And, you know, lately I've been kind of downloading these random British trance and dance compilations.
I'm just like, I just want more dance music.
Gimme, gimme, gimme.
So, I found this one and I kind of like this one.
It's a little bit poppy, but...
I just like it, so I'm putting it in the cage match, because I think you guys will like it too, and I think this is like total DDR songs, so we'll see.
This artist is named Diamond, somebody I've never heard of, but this is the artist Diamond, and the song is Reason.
Enjoy, you guys.
Something in the air, I don't know why You were hardly there when I was on my own There's something about you that makes me cry
Thanks for watching!
All right, boys and girls, that was song number two tonight, Diamond with Reason.
Let's go around and see what everybody thought, if they had a reason to love it or a reason to despise it.
DarkSakura.
I hate to say it was pretty generic, not too exciting.
It was good, it was solid, but generic, so it gets a five and a half.
Five and a half.
Loki.
It was okay.
It reminded me of the bass line, it reminded me of something from Run Lola Run, but then it sounded like some other song I heard of, and so it's, I don't know, it's just kind of, it's not bad, it just sounds familiar.
And then, so I give it a seven.
And then I give the porn on my PSP a 10 Which you were putting on cam during that song Yes I did You know what I think the familiarity is?
Somebody pointed this out in the chatroom Who said this?
Because I totally agree with what they said I apologize to who said this because I can't Oh, Fireboma said It has a very Lasco feeling to it Oh no, Zaku said it first Legend of Zaku said it has a very Lasco sound to it I kind of agree It sounds like them Which is interesting because Lasco actually had a song on this exact same CD But it sounded like totally unlike them So go figure
Anyway, I like it.
It's poppy.
I think somebody said they could sing along to it.
I feel the same way.
It's a drive in my car and sing and feel happy and pretty.
So I give it an 8.
Toadie.
I was in the bathroom and I missed about half the song.
It sounded pretty generic to me.
Like I said, I only caught the last third of it or so.
But... I don't know.
It didn't strike me as anything particularly...
Outstanding.
I'll give it a six.
Alrighty.
But... I was in the kitchen and it sounded like standard pop.
And, yeah, nothing terribly exciting.
Six.
It's definitely driving the car, singing along, be gay, all that.
Yeah, yeah, thanks.
I do that too, just...
You be gay?
Alright.
Gayest and happy.
Yes, exactly.
Alright, alright.
Anyway, let's move on.
There is one more song you guys get to vote for tonight.
Here it is.
It's Jamie's pick.
Jamie, what did you pick for us tonight?
I'm sure people have heard this on my Tuesday show, Plug Plug.
But this is a song off of the CD called Demo Crazy, which was by Damon Auburn of Blur, also the guy behind Gorillaz.
Big surprise, huh?
But this is a remix of a song off of that album called A Rappy Song.
It's really out there.
You know, the title alone makes me think of PSO.
Am I just a nerd?
All rappies?
Am I just a nerd because I think of rag rappies?
Well, the thing is... Keep in mind, I haven't heard the song yet.
How's this for nerdy?
There actually is... Oh, your mic just went off.
Hello?
There you are.
There is an item called an Alrapi that you could use to boost your stats and the developers were using it for game testing.
Oh.
And I've got some.
Cheater.
I cheated PSO and I'm proud of it.
Alright, here we go.
Song number three tonight, Damon Albrin with A Rapi Song, the remix.
Enjoy.
Thank you for watching!
I can't believe you have to stay behind me, go beyond and talk to me baby, tell me why, so now your people can try to follow me, programming your fear to die.
Thank you for watching!
Song number three, Damon Albren with a Rappi song, the remix.
Did you think it was Rappi or Crappi?
DarkSakura.
I'm just really pissed off at the people who are being fucking rude about all of these songs.
So I'm giving it... Don't let them ruffle your feathers.
No, the thing is that I see this week after week, and this is bullshit.
You know, we are doing this show for you people, and the least you can do is be nice, okay?
So I give the chat room a negative 50, and I give my song a 10.
All right, Loki.
I didn't care for this song.
Not at all.
Gets a four.
I thought it was kind of quirky.
I don't know, it had a nice groove to it, though.
I can't say I didn't like it, because I thought it was kind of groovy and it made me bounce, so that's worth something, so I give it a seven.
Toadie.
Yeah, I got to agree with that.
I mean, it was pretty damn weird, but I noticed I was sitting there, like, you know, bouncing, you know, my head to it.
Yeah, it's quirky.
Yeah, it was something I think I could listen to.
I'd give it an 8.
I liked that one.
Alrighty.
Bug!
I'd give it a 7.
It was definitely something you can bop along to.
Alright.
Alright!
That being said, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.
Song number one you can vote for is Politary with No One Lives Forever, I think.
Yes!
Okay, thank you.
Where's my clip?
There we go.
All right, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Diamond with Reason.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Damon Albren with a rappy song.
Alright guys, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.
Song number one, song number two, or song number three.
Hurry, hurry, hurry, get your votes in now, because we don't leave the window open very long, so send those in.
If you're not sure how to do that, ask somebody in chat, they will help you out, because they're nice.
Alright, this is the part of the show where I usually ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene.
So, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?
As far as I'm aware, nothing.
And I'm double-checking to make sure, you know, that that's not the case.
I would hope that there's something going on.
Anyways...
No, really, um, I don't think there is anything going on as far as, um, releases go, because I was checking the other day for, um, some brand new, you know, the food mix stuff, see if there's any, um, you know, new stuff for that, but, um, no, no, there, there wasn't, so, but like I said, I'm double checking right now.
I should have done this earlier.
Um, whatever, you know, honestly, it doesn't matter.
Um,
But anyways, let's see here.
You might check out DDRUK since they're still coming about.
And I'm sure they're working on still the... What was it?
The brand new SimFiles 4, I think.
I think they're finishing up Ultramix 2 or something.
They're the song packs for Ultramix 2.
Last time I checked.
Um...
But really, other than that, you're not going to find much new stuff out there because there really isn't that much new stuff coming around.
I'm seeing if there's any developments in the food mix thing here.
I wish.
Food mix 2 needs to come out.
Needs to come out now.
Are they actually doing a food mix 2?
Yep.
Oh, hot.
I reported that a while ago.
No, but anyways.
I forgot.
Okay, kill me.
No, here's what's going on.
Looks like DDRCNC style selection from Beat Mario.
Their webpage is updated, whatever that's supposed to mean.
I don't know.
It doesn't say anything.
So guess what, folks?
That means nothing's going on.
Nada.
Just some more shitty sim files, Bavani style.
But hey, you can't blame it on myself.
How many Max remixes posted in the last day?
Let's find out, shall we?
No, honestly, um... I haven't seen that many Max remixes lately.
I actually haven't seen any Max remixes lately.
I think they may be just not even trying to make them with any structure whatsoever.
The ones I've seen have been like these stupid boss files.
and those are really crappy, but just for shits and giggles, let's see how many Max remixes there are since the last time we broadcast.
I vote 20.
You think 20?
Okay.
And the winner is...
Starion Survivor Max Starion Survivor Max
Starion, Survivor, Rizla, Max, Deep, Dynamite, Max Attack, Trip Machine, Climax, Max Period,
Max420, LOL, DJ, OB, VI, DJ Vicious, eat your heart out, some joke file, and Max Unlimited, edit, and then Max Wipeout version 2.
Honestly, folks, none of this stuff's worth downloading.
Just save your time.
Do something more constructive like download porn.
Seriously.
Honestly, there's a lot more porn out there than sim files, and you know what?
With porn, you can never get bad porn, so that's
That's good to know.
All right.
Anything else?
I say, you know, make porn, not, you know, bad Maxim files.
That's what... Actually, no, I don't want to see anyone making porn.
Please don't make your own porn.
Don't, don't.
Especially considering most of you are under 18.
Don't do that!
That would be illegal.
All right.
We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, guys.
I want to start talking about Xtreme 2 a little bit, though.
But if you do want to get in on the Skype line, let me tell you this.
I know that tons of people want to get in tonight.
So be ready.
www.
I've actually got emails of people that want to get in, like, or wanting me to open it up special for them.
So you're going to have to go against them.
www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.
Click on Interact With Us and get your program ready.
Anyway, I want to talk about Extreme 2 real quick.
Now, the person that found DDR Ultramix 3 was this person, Tep, over on DDR Freak.
And then after Tep found out about the Ultramix 3, one of the admins over there, Cutris, actually went over and started kind of, I guess, scouring GamePro's site a little bit and found out that GamePro also spilled the beans on Extreme 2!
Oops.
Oops, they did it again, and I say that for a reason, because one of the big shockers in this article is that Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 will have Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again as confirmed songs.
Now, I know this thrills DarkSakura to no end here, considering how she feels about that type of music.
Isn't that Jenny in a Bottle?
It's not Jenny in a Bottle.
How about Shit in a Bag?
Set that on fire.
Alright, so that was one big revolution, or revolution, revelation made.
Again, they're saying over 100 minutes of dance music going to be in there.
And they're saying, this is what GamePro is saying now, keep in mind that I believe it was them or somebody said this last year and it didn't really happen, but they are saying PlayStation 2 owners will be able to go head-to-head with a new online feature.
So the online thing,
The Online Thing doing so well in Ultramix 2 that now it's going to be a part of Extreme 2 as well.
Very interesting, I think.
As if you didn't know enough stupid people on Xbox Live.
Now you get to meet them on PlayStation 2, which opens up a whole new world of stupid people.
And then that's about it, although we do know that iToySupport is coming back, and as well... Yeah, iToySupport's coming back, and let's see... Workout mode is coming as well, and you get to do your own steps in edit mode, of course, as well.
So, that's about it.
The online mode being the biggest thing about that, as well as the Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again.
So...
This goes back to what I said earlier.
Remember I said I'd mention this again.
Remember, boys and girls, DDR Extreme is not made for you.
It's made partially for you, and you'll get something out of it.
You'll get your Sakura, I'm sure.
I don't know anything for sure, but I think it's a given that Sakura will probably show up in this one.
But now, for the Slumber Party girls, they're going to have genie in a bottle and oops, I did it again.
Deal.
And you also have to remember that none of these girls usually, I shouldn't say none, a very small percentage of these nine-year-old Slumber Party girls are going to play on heavy, but...
Konami is going to give them 7 foot steps with 200 steps on heavy anyway.
Wouldn't it be comedy gold though if they made Genie in a Bottle like a 10 footer?
I would actually probably buy the game.
Just as a joke.
But this is interesting.
If it's online, then people can create their own steps.
So you know there's going to be 10-foot steps out there to oops, I did it again, but they'll be crap.
It'll be like finger-finger revolution stuff where it's like, oops, I did it again.
Let's make no sense.
Just a big string of 16th notes that go in random, no sensical order whatsoever.
Much like many in the groove 12-footers.
Or they'll just go in and add triplets, which don't go to anything.
So...
Very interesting.
It was actually EGM.
Thank you for the tip there.
EGM was actually the one that said that online play would be included last year, and they were wrong.
But now GamePro is saying it this year.
And hopefully, I don't know.
Do you think online play is a good thing for DDR?
I think it's a bad thing.
Are you asking me that specifically?
Or are you asking the chat room?
I guess anybody in the room that wants to answer that.
We'll do the Skype line thing later for those who want to ask.
Well, it's pretty much impossible for them to tell who's using a controller and who's using a pad.
I mean, it's really not worth my time to try and put forth a bunch of... Well, now Xbox Live will tell you who's using a controller.
I was actually under the impression that they had some sort of system that allowed them to bypass that.
I think everybody will hack anything.
Yeah.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
For 99% of players, it's not going to matter.
Yeah, I mean, I guess for the people that can't get out to an arcade, it's great.
I mean, for me, I would never use it.
I'd just rather go to my local arcade or whatever and play people.
But this is interesting because this kind of ties into what you were talking about in the last show, Loki, is you were talking about this is where DDR is going, is that because the arcades are dying and nobody seems to care anymore, online mode is where it's going to.
So does this news surprise you at all, Loki?
I'm kind of curious.
No, but...
Then again, they need more things to be on their network adapter.
After all, they don't want to be like the GameCube.
Well, now, who knows?
There might be some big thing that comes down with DDR with Mario, which is the one game we didn't get a new news on this week.
Very soon, though.
Think about it, guys.
We're only a week and a half away.
Honestly, folks, do you really think you're going to get online play with anything on the GameCube?
No.
You'll get LAN play.
Hello, LAN play.
Enjoy me.
Maybe, maybe.
Yeah, I wouldn't expect to get online play of DDR with Mario.
It would be very weird because DDR with Mario.
Stupid kids don't know how to use the internet.
What the hell are we talking about?
Alright.
Honestly.
Damn Mario.
Fucking A. Why doesn't he plumb something?
I mean, honestly, he's been doing a lot of, like, macking on princesses and, like, smashing turtles, but I haven't actually seen him, you know, unclog a toilet.
He just unclogs the princess all the time.
No, they unclog the pipes of all of those monsters in Mario Brothers.
He cleans her pipes.
He cleans her pipes.
Waxes.
With his plunger.
God.
We've sunk that low.
Yes, we have.
All right, I think that's a sign that we probably should reveal the cage match winner.
Are you guys ready to hear about the cage match winner tonight?
I don't care.
Why not?
Tons of people voted in tonight's cage match.
I think this is one of the largest turnouts we've had in a while.
And the winning song won by only two votes, if you can believe that.
You want to hear the song that won?
We'll see.
Damon Aldrin with a crappy song.
Oh, shit!
No, I'm really fucking surprised.
You know what?
I think what happened, because the other songs had the exact same number of votes, I think the trance vote got split and it allowed the quirk thing to go through.
Either that or after you spanked everybody in the chat room, they voted for you out of fear.
No, seriously, all I wanted was for people just to be a little bit more open.
And it wasn't just for me.
They were bitching about everything that went through.
So I was like, stop bitching.
Just listen.
You know what?
People will bitch about everything.
So the internet's for us.
You know what?
As an internet celebrity, you're going to have to deal with this.
I know.
There's going to be paparazzi out there that are going to photograph you when you're feeling fat.
But like any celebrity, I have to throw a temper tantrum every so often so they can be on the cover of the star.
Okay.
And then I can sue them for money for something.
You know what we need?
We need like an internet version of the star.
And we should be in it.
It has to be a flattering story.
No fat pictures of me.
Nude sunbathing or anything like that.
How about we make a website called fakenews.com?
They probably already have it.
That's why we're not going to make it.
Alright, let me check.
Hey, moviepoopshoot.com is still around.
Oh my god.
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, it's your show, boys and girls, and I always fear this part of the show when I let it be their show.
Ha!
There is no fakenews.com.
We will make it happen.
Somebody's going to get to it before you.
We'll see.
Anyway guys, we're going to go to a break.
When we come back, it's your show because we are going to open up the Skype line right after this.
In this break though, you get music from, I figure since we've done a lot of home stuff tonight, we're going to do Ultramix 2 in this break.
So enjoy this selection of music from Ultramix 2 and we'll be back after this.
Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for real The time is right for this, a love to shine on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do
Thank you for watching!
I'm the only one for me.
Music Music Music Music

Thanks for watching!
Let me tell you something you don't know Let me tell you something you don't know
Let me tell you something you don't know
Orange Lounge Radio.
We put your thing down, flip it, and reverse it.
God, that's lame.
All right, we're back here.
with Orange Lounge Radio and it's your turn boys and girls we're going to open up the skype line for you guys to get in and call and give us your opinion on what's going on if you want more information on how to get in www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on interact with us and you too can be on the skype line let's take our first call hello you're on Orange Lounge Radio hello Sky it's El Mullet calling hello El Mullet how are you
Good, how about yourself?
Good, I think we have a little bit of a delay, so start talking.
What's on your mind?
Well, basically, now that we've got the news on Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, I'm starting to get pretty pumped for this year's E3.
I am absolutely pumped for this year's E3.
When you consider that we have Extreme 2 and we have Ultramix 3 and we have DDR with Mario and we have Karaoke Revolution 4 and we have God knows whatever Red Octane's going to show and whatever Korean crap shows up in Kenshiya Hall, this is going to be a beautiful E3 for us music gamers.
I'm very happy.
This is going to be the best year for music games period.
And I do have something to say for all the
Yes, what would you like to say?
I was going to say anything, what I wanted to say to all the naysayers, to all the people who decided to come out and bitch right out of the gate as soon as the announcements were made, shut up, you don't know what's going to be on these games outside of Genie and Oops, and that's two songs out of a possible 65 plus song mix, shut up.
I agree, I agree, those people just need to sit down and shut up until we have more information on the game.
You want to know why no company wants to release information on games before E3?
It's because this is what people do with, you know, any game that has a loyal fan base, is that people start just tearing the shit apart, and they dream up this own list in their head of everything they want, or the game's gonna suck, and then, you know, they're disappointed because the developers have a different vision.
So, you want to know why
Everybody keeps it in their pants until E3.
This is why.
It's a perfect example.
Go look at the thread and everybody bitching.
Any thoughts?
Why can't it be like arcades that have all my favorite songs on them?
Where's my Max Period from the other home version?
God, some people piss me off.
This game better have Sakura.
I'm not buying this game unless Sakura is in it.
Jesus, people.
Sakura is like the most horrid song in DDR Extreme.
I will not buy this game unless Sakura is not in it.
Ha!
Got you.
Sakura makes everything cool.
I want as much licensed mainstream crap as humanly possible.
I want to see people so pissed off at this year's song list that steam is coming out of their ears while I sit back, copy of Extreme 2, laughing my ass off.
That's right.
You know what kind of... Let's dream for a minute here.
Let's think about if I were to make DDR Extreme 2.
Let's think for a minute here.
What types of songs...
What I want to put in Extreme 2, let me think, I'm going to make my mix here for a minute here.
Let's see, so I would definitely have Oops I Did It Again, and Genie in a Bottle would definitely have to be in this.
And I was trying to queue up some musical stuff, but my thing is frozen.
There we go, there we go, thank you.
Okay, let's see.
Uh-oh, did the feed drop?
I think we're still here.
I'm still with you.
There may be a delay, but I'm still with you.
I think we had a spot of downtime there, but we're back.
Who cares?
We were just, like, rambling.
The internet declined your request of making a custom DVR mix.
Sorry, Rob.
Yeah, I guess so.
The internet just didn't want that to happen.
My bad.
Oh, this must not happen!
I think it was live 365 because we never disconnected.
I'm not sure what happened there, guys.
All right, let's just keep rolling here because the archives are going.
So I guess if you want to hear what happened during the chaos moment there, just listen to the DDR Freak archive because it'll all be there.
Actually, I think if any of you guys are on the net, I need you to stop what you're doing.
Stop your uploads and stop whatever you're doing.
Close any programs that are connected to the internet.
Oh, man, so much for my six-bit torrent.
We need all the bandwidth right now.
Is it?
Okay, all right.
We never disconnected.
It's live 365.
They've done this to me, too.
Okay.
It's the goddamn government.
They're hacksering us.
I am showing the stations up on the air and streaming, so it's just going to take them a minute to get in.
Oh my god, they shut off the monitor!
Let's do this.
Let's go.
Mullet, why don't I give you a call right back?
We're going to go to a music break, okay?
Mullet, are you still there?
They killed Mullet!
Oh my god!
Okay, we're going to go to a music break and come right back, okay?
I'm not dead!
We'll call you back.
Okay, so we're going to go to a music break real quick here.
If you guys are with us, we are going to go to a break here while everything is...
being burned and destroyed and it's awful.
Oh my god, the choppers.
Oh no, the government guys with their cell phones are going to signal us to death.
I think I have a very... DP reference.
Cancer!
I have a very appropriate song for this break, too, and it's actually topical, so people reconnecting during this downtime will find this to be hilarious.
See, perhaps, though, they were just thinking that, you know, ET wanted the phone home, so they were just providing him with the walkie-talkie that he could do that with.
They were just trying to be helpful instead of hurtful.
Let's take a minute out and come back, okay?
Ah, fine.
I think I did it again I made you believe We're more than just friends Oh baby
I played with your heart Got lost in this game Oh baby
Thanks for watching!
All right, we are back here on Orange Launch Radio, and an appropriate choice there.
We played the fifth mix version of Oops, I Did It Again during our little downtime there.
Sorry about that.
I don't know what happened.
I think a combination of Live 365 did a net fart, and then I was trying to launch iTunes because I was going to do a gag because Elmullet and I were talking about songs that we would like to see on DDR Extreme 2.
Surprise, an Apple product crashing.
So actually, what I'm going to do now, I know a lot of you guys are actually calling in, but I do want to give Elmullet a proper chance to say goodbye.
So we're calling him right back.
Hi, Elmullet, you there?
I'm here, Sky.
How's it going?
Good.
I think we still have a little bit of that delay, but that's okay.
Elmullet, live from the Middle East.
So I don't know what happened there.
But actually, I have to say, the best comment, one of the best comments I've ever seen in our chat room came during that break.
And somebody said, who has a dark tetsuya, said, it's the rapture.
Like we'd be the ones disappearing during the rapture.
All right, anyway, so El Mullet.
In my dream fantasy extreme, too, I was going to get to, I was going to do audio clips, but iTunes decided to kill my computer.
We have, I would have, oops, I did it again, Genie in a Bottle, My Prerogative, the New My New My A song has to be in there for sure.
Venga Boys, We Like to Party, definitely would be in there as well.
Alice DJ, Better Off Alone.
Madonna...
Old School Madonna and New School Madonna would definitely have to be in it.
And let's see, what else would be in there?
Somebody told me, because you know that.
Yeah, somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend and all that stuff.
And then we would definitely have to have all of the American Idols as well.
Oh my God, we need Clay.
And Clay.
Because he's hot.
Clay is hot.
If I was invisible.
Step.
Oh, it'd be great.
And they'd all have ten-footers, and so, you know, it'd be invisible.
Anyway.
I'll tell you this.
If I'm interrupting, there would be fifth mix.
It would all be fifth mix plus random add-ons.
I like the idea.
It would be glorious.
I like the idea of DDR2.
I would be the only one who would buy the copy because, well, let's face it.
Yeah.
Go lag.
I know, we have horrible, horrible lag tonight.
So, oh well.
Yeah, I agree with the idea that Fifth Mix would rock.
Let's just pour Fifth Mix in.
Let's try to get all the original versions of song, too.
Let's get the original, like, tribal dance and all that stuff.
That'd be great.
But we have to have the new My New My A song in there.
Come on.
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go.
This delay is horrible.
I'll try this again.
That's all right.
Have a good one, Mollet.
Very, very sorry.
That's all right.
Have a good one, Mollet.
Take care, and I'll plug it for him.
InsidePulse.com is super duper, so visit it.
I know what song needs to be in there.
What?
The Muppet one.
Manamana.
Manamana.
That's in a commercial now.
Alright, we are taking calls on our Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on interact with us if you are interested in giving us a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?
Legend of Zaku.
Hello, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?
Well, I just got a few things I managed to find.
I don't know, I'm just trying to perpetuate the rumor cycle a little bit.
Oh, Christ, what's up?
I hope you have a link right now.
I'm posting up a link right now from a person's live journal.
Apparently, this is going to sound strange, but just bear with me.
It seems that this guy who's posting on his live journal basically, you know, heard some information a while back, and I mean like about maybe two or three years ago.
They were going to bring back a new DDR Arcade mix this year.
And the reason why he posted it is because a second person heard about this and it wasn't from the poster's source.
Sky?
Okay, yeah, no, no, I'm with you here.
I'm here, I'm with you.
I'm just listening to you.
Yeah, but I posted up the link.
Alright, I'm going to look at this link.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.
That's why he posted it.
Okay, so, they said years ago that this was supposed to be the year that DDR comes back, and let's see, I'm gonna, let's, da-da-da-da-da.
This comes from some guy's journal.
I've seen this guy around DDR3.
Cucumber is the name.
New DDR arcade makes its debut in September.
Rumor, rumor, rumor.
My first source said that an individual who has direct ties to Konami of Japan heard straight from them that DDR Extreme 2 will be previewed at Tokyo Game Show in September.
They've supposedly changed the hardware to make the game unbootlegable, although I doubt it took since December 2002 to do that.
My second source said there will be a location test in October.
Um...
I doubt it.
Whatever.
I mean, honestly, I've got to tell you, Zaku, it's another rumor to me.
It seems like every three months somebody's got the rumor they have a friend who knows Konami of Japan.
Yeah, but the fact that a second person found out would mean that, you know, two things.
A, that the rumor is probably, you know, spread to some other person.
Or B, there might be a second person who might have found a credible source.
So it could go either way.
Well, you're right.
Any of these rumors could go either way.
There's tons of things out there on the internet that are probably rumors now that will turn to fact later on.
You don't know.
I hope it's true.
I would love it if this news were true.
I hope it's true.
The unbootlegable part is kind of sad because that means we probably won't see the machines here, but something tells me we'll see them one way or another.
I hope it's true.
I don't know what else I can add to that.
There's no such thing as unbootlegable anything.
Yeah, I know.
Everything's pirateable.
But I hope it's true, and I don't know what else to say.
I mean, the signs are pretty clear right now.
Politary is saying some stuff about recording a new song, and this, you know, I don't know whether or not it's adding up to something, but it's out there.
It might not be true at first, but you know, it might be something that might be the basis for an official word.
It ever does come to that point.
I see how it also adds up together, you're right, the Politary and Naoki thing kind of going along with this makes everything kind of look add up, but also you have to realize, with three new games coming out in the US this year, three new DDR games and a Karaoke Revolution game, which, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if Naoki ever did something for that, you know, it's very possible that the Politary thing is for one of these games.
But still, I mean, we just have to look at the possibilities.
I hope you're right.
I hope you're right.
I hope this guy's right.
I hope I'm right, I mean, I just, you know, the only thing I'm, I don't know, maybe Konami might pull something out of their ass in E3 that might shock us all, that might shock us all and keep, and basically surprise the hell out of us, or, you know, maybe it might be when they drop the, when they release the new DDR games, I don't know, maybe some edit mode for some future arcade mix, now that they've already, you know, now that they have, you know, USB mode working, thank you Gran Turismo 4 for that.
You know what, it would, you know, it,
It wouldn't be an E3 if somebody doesn't drop a bombshell.
So I would love it for it to be to Konami, but who knows.
Konami may have had it all already blown already from GamePro, thank you.
So who knows.
Yeah, but they might have saved some of the stuff that hasn't seen light yet.
And basically everything's ready for them to do almost about anything beyond the home release.
as per saying a new arcade mix.
They already have a third-party distributor up.
It shouldn't be that hard to add USB slots to replace the memory card slots.
You know what?
I'm glad you brought... The Gran Turismo 4 is probably the first game to...
I'm glad you brought the USB thing up because I'll tell you what, one thing that is really getting me into In The Groove and the arcade is the USB support.
It is phenomenal.
I actually picked up a jump drive so I could check out what this does.
I'll tell you what, the In The Groove USB support damn near sells that game to me.
It is that good.
The USB support is phenomenal in that game.
Almost as good as the Stepmania USB stick.
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.
That's the same damn thing.
I don't care.
But this is something that's actually in the arcade.
You know what I mean?
It's different.
It's not... Shut up.
I wouldn't be surprised if Konami threw that in for their, you know, if they decided to continue to be on the arcades Konami should put mines in their game and show the in the groove folks how it feels Except they won't be mines, they'll be super bad stuff, or they'll be bombs or something, you know And stick it to the in the groove folks and let them know how it feels a little bit But don't take the hand plants idea, leave it in that other game
Konami has the ability to wipe them out for all they care, but they're just waiting.
They're waiting to see how In The Groove does.
And then they'll probably bring out their big guns just to hold on to their market.
That's my prediction right there.
They're playing the waiting game.
That's all they do.
It's going to be a very interesting E3.
I would love nothing more than for Konami and Red Octane to be right across from each other, but we know it won't happen.
Yes, as rivals, just holding fists like, like, like as if, you know, like a Mortal Kombat versus Green.
You know what, though?
Despite, despite anything negative I've said about in the groove in the past, competition benefits all of us in the long run.
So, I think that's it right there.
Competition will benefit us all.
Yeah, that basically spurs innovation.
Alright, I'm cutting, I'm, You have someone to go after.
Alright, I'm cutting you off now, Zaku.
Closing time.
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here, buddy.
Alright, bye.
All right.
Nice quote of a song there.
You're right.
Thank you.
What, what, what, what?
I have a cousin who knows a guy who knows a girl who's dating a guy who knows somebody at Konami.
No, get this.
Okay, this is great.
The new arcade system, it's going to have this little thing in the background.
It's actually going to be like some sort of score telling thing.
If you do really good in it, you get contacted by aliens that actually take you up in their starship
to go serve other aliens a la, like, The Last Starfighter.
It's fucking awesome.
Konami is taking on the universe, man!
Loki, shut up.
We got another call.
You're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello?
Hi.
Did you have to talk to your mom there in the background or something?
It sounded like you were talking to somebody in the background.
Hi, someone else.
Alright, what's up?
What's on your mind?
Actually, the first question I have is about the Astro Printer pad.
Okay.
Now, I mean, originally I was going to get the bundle for Ending Groove with the Ignition pad, but now, I mean, I saw these screenshots that you guys showed, and you say it's probably, you know, like the best metal pad to get.
The Cobalt Flux, at least.
I haven't played Cobalt Flux, so I can't give an opinion on that.
And save up more money.
I have a Cobalt Flux and I just played on the Afterburner.
I would honestly rather save the $100 and just play on the Afterburner.
I actually prefer the Afterburner over the Cobalt Flux.
We also got to play on Ignition 3.0, which is basically the new Ignition, it's just now they've taken the arrows and they've de-DDR'd them, and they're just these generic orange arrows now, and it also has USB support.
The Ignition 3.0 honestly did nothing for me that Ignition 2.0 didn't already do.
So Ignition 3.0 is the exact same as all the other Ignitions they put out.
But After Burner, if you've got the money to drop, you really have to evaluate, how much will I use this thing?
And if you think you're going to use it a lot, it's something you're going to play every day or every other day, make a part of your exercise routine, yes, I say it's worth the money.
But if you honestly evaluate how much you play DDR, and see, for somebody like me, even though I talk a lot about DDR, how much do I actually go play it at home?
I don't actually play at home a whole lot.
I prefer to go to the arcades.
So for me, I don't see the point in getting a metal stage.
I would rather have the ignition pad because it's not worth it to me.
But if you don't get to play DDR in the arcades a lot or whatever, and you think you're going to play this a lot at home, I say go for it.
You won't regret it.
Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't get to play it as much in arcades, so that's what I'm thinking about.
Alright.
But then again, I'm thinking, how long does it last?
You know, that's a good question.
I don't know, I'm not Red Octane, but I know it took a lot of abuse in the group night.
People were playing with shoes on and heels and everything and playing the crazy songs and it seemed to hold up.
Yeah, the arrows are not acrylic.
I'm pretty sure there's some form of plexiglass, so they're not going to smash if you step on them 20 times.
So I just, I don't know though, but you have to look, I've had ignition pads that die after six to nine months, so I'm hoping it's not the same thing with the afterburner, especially considering that kind of investment.
But unfortunately, until these things hit the market, we won't know how long they really last.
So nobody can really say.
You're taking a little bit of a gamble.
I would say if Red Octane has some reasonable type, and I'm not familiar with Red Octane directly, I've always bought their products in stores when I've bought their products, but if they have some type of warranty replacement program as long as it's reasonable, I say go for it, because you don't know how long these things are going to last.
Yeah, yeah, right.
I'll probably get it then, thanks.
Alright, no problem.
Anything else for us?
Um, probably.
I mean, I have a lot of opinions now in the group since I actually finally got to play it last week.
Alright, what do you think?
So, I mean, it's pretty interesting.
Like, I don't like how it's such a... It's not as varied as DDR is with the music, which is probably my biggest problem.
Mm-hmm.
But otherwise, it looks pretty good.
I mean, the difficulty is really hard, but whatever.
I'm willing to dish out money for the home version anyway, just for something new to play.
Yeah, I mean, it's going to be, what, $30, I think?
Don't quote me on that.
$40 at most.
And you get a t-shirt.
Whatever.
A keychain.
People that are dedicated to these games enough to be tuning into this show are probably not going to regret the purchase, honestly.
Just go for it.
Yeah, definitely.
Alright, well I'm going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thanks for calling in, alright?
There will be a day where I will review in the group someday.
Alright, let's take one more call here.
Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hey guys.
Hello, is this Angel?
Yep.
What's on your mind?
You're not here tonight!
I know.
What's going on?
Sicker than crap.
Sorry to hear it.
Well, I know that you feel better, first off.
Rest up and feel better.
What did you think?
Because you had to go to the In The Groove party because I had to beg somebody to go with me because Jamie had to... Matt had to work and Jamie had the school thing, so I was begging LiveJournal and you took it up.
So you had to go.
What did you think?
I thought it was awesome.
It's going to give me something to do while I'm waiting for...
Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.
It's just going to be a filler.
I like both games differently.
I like DDR for DDR.
I like in the group for in the group.
So I'm not going to sit there and knock it because I'm still getting exercise and I'm still liking the music that either game offers.
I think that's a very fair way to look at it.
You know what?
It's just...
Bitch and cry and moan all you want.
Both these games are out there and they're going to be available, so why not eat them up and just enjoy what both games have to offer.
And I'm glad that you guys liked the Afterburner because I wanted to try it, but I was just not wearing the right shoes that day, so I was just like, eh, I don't want to kill myself.
So I might actually end up buying that with the games.
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.
Oh, and you forgot...
Yeah, yeah, Angel?
You forgot the little spoof about you and the bar when Pirate was trying to play.
That was pretty funny when we all raided the press room.
Oh, God, that's right.
Okay, remember this?
Okay, because they took the stool away from Toadie, what I ended up doing when we were in the media room is you decided you were going to play some insane song.
So I was like, here, hold on to my hand, and you can use my hand as the bar, and he did it.
It worked.
This is how people are going to have to do it at home.
He held on to my hand, not in a homosexual way, but he held on to my hand as the bar, and he played, and it actually worked.
Well, the guys, whoever was dancing next to you, I didn't know him, but you... I think his name was Andre.
He's from Oregon.
Okay, well, he did the same thing, and I actually snapped a picture of it.
Yeah, I saw that one.
Somebody commented on the website about that, like, dude, is somebody using a hand as the bar?
Yes, because we... And I would like to say that was my idea.
Yeah.
Copyright.
That was my idea.
Patent pending.
That was great.
Yay.
All right.
Anyway, hide a pirate and hide everyone there.
I'm sorry I'm not there, but hey.
Yeah, feel better.
I take it we're not meeting at CCL on Tuesday.
Actually, I... I will be there.
I think we are.
Talk to your girlfriend.
Okay.
All right.
Will do.
All right.
Have a good one, Angel.
Thanks for calling.
All right.
Bye, guys.
Bye.
Have a good one.
Yeah, it was arm raping.
It was pretty hot.
It was hot.
One other thing I've got to say.
I noticed, because sometimes I look at people chatting on different forums.
How many different places did you say, Rob took three pictures of my ass and put them on the Horizons Radio Gallery for you all to see?
I think I put it on two different places.
It was on my LiveJournal and then...
I know I commented on the Orange Lounge site.
That might have been it.
It just seemed like everywhere I was reading you said something about, God, Rob takes all these pictures of my ass.
Well, I mean, it is a nice ass.
It doesn't even exist.
I don't even have one at my body weight.
You know what?
I was just trying to get pictures of ham plants because I was actually going to do something with no ham plants.
I don't believe you.
You're right.
It was all about your ass.
All right.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Personal on Skyline.
Greetings from New York.
It's the one and only Ranma.
How are you guys doing?
Good.
How are you, Ranma?
What's on your mind?
Pretty good.
I want to give you my quick Anime Boston review wrap-up in like 14 minutes.
Make it really, really, really quick because you're actually breaking up a little bit.
Your voice is breaking there, so make it quick.
Crap, I'm gonna make it really quick.
Anime Boss was great.
I'm gonna play DD on Forever.
The Tokyo Game Action guys say hi.
And, um, the masquerade kind of sucked.
It seems if you made your own costume, but you wore shoes, you automatically disqualified.
What?
You wore shoes?
You got the... What the hell?
Whatever.
Well, you know what?
We need to get out to some anime cons and get our name out there some more.
I need to go or something.
We need to get a little room.
I want to travel to the East Coast.
Some East Coast person fly us out there.
We'll do a table thing or whatever.
It'll be fun.
Dude, if y'all fly out to the East Coast, y'all can stay in my room for free.
You promise not to take advantage of us, right?
Never.
All right.
Sounds good.
We've got to get an opportunity to cosplay.
Yeah.
Thank you for the offer.
We appreciate it.
Anyway, buddy, because you're kind of breaking up, I'm going to let you go.
But have a good one, okay?
You too.
Alright, bye.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

I love you.
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and now it's time for that part of the show where we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the week, which, by the way, we have new background music for tonight, all of us.
Yay!
I already missed my old one.
If you were getting sick of those songs.
Well, you know, I could start it off with your old one and then get into the new one.
That's okay.
I do kind of like the way it started.
This one starts off and changes.
All right, we'll do that.
Um, okay, so, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week, DarkSakura?
Eh, fuck it.
My FU goes toward, um, this Tittle Insurance Company, it's spelled T-I-T-T-L-E.
And when I first looked, I was like, well, no, I was thinking maybe it's title, and they misspelled it, but no.
Anyway, this, and actually, I transferred from person to person, then to another claims company, then to another claims company here in Sacramento, and it's just been stupid.
He calls me and says, well, call me back, blah, blah, blah.
So I leave him two fucking messages, and he never calls me back, the bastard.
So...
I'm gonna have to wait again to find out when I get my damn money to fix my damn car.
Um, my fiance was supposed to hammer my, uh, fender back into place so that I could at least drive it.
No, it rained.
Sorry!
Um... You know, I just really miss having a car.
I-I feel like... Like my left arm's been cut off.
You know, you can function without a left arm, but it fucking sucks.
And that's how I feel.
Um...
Uh, apart from that, um, you know, fuck the people who have no sense of adventure and don't like anything new.
Because you don't fucking give it a chance!
Okay, I'm done.
And now we move on to Loki.
Anyways...
I love this song.
First FU goes to Epson and their wonderful printers and ink.
Did you know, and this is an unknown fact here, did you know it's actually cheaper to buy a new printer than to buy cartridges for said printer?
That's pretty sad.
And what's great, though, is they actually have their cartridges.
It literally would have cost me like 60 bucks to actually buy a cartridge.
You know, cartridges for this stupid printer.
And the printers have, the cartridges have timed...
This, like, programming is basically timed, so after a certain amount of time, whether you're using it or not, it'll say it's empty.
Thank you, Epson!
Appreciate your wonderful product there.
Well, guess what, folks?
I ain't gonna play by that.
So, um, I bought new, cheaper cartridges, and I bought a- and I also got a program for free that locks in the value so that it will just work until it's done.
Also, fuck you too, stupid people driving your cars, cause-
For some reason, you just don't understand what that stupid little flashy light is that's on the corner of your cars.
Guess what?
It's a turn signal.
People use it to signal when they're changing lanes.
Maybe you should learn how to do that.
Thank you.
Fuck you to Ridley Scott for wasting two and a half hours of my life with a crappy movie called Kingdom of Heaven.
Should have known that it was going to suck when the word heaven was in the title.
But you know what?
Guess what?
The movie sucked.
It's basically if you took all the battles from Lord of the Rings and made them anticlimactic, that would be the movie.
Enjoy.
It sucked.
And then, finally, um, fuck you to, um, the really crappy party you had in Final Fantasy XI.
I've been, like, not playing for, like, a while now, and I finally got back into playing, and the first thing I get is a party that lasts for two battles, and then it's over.
Fucking sucked ass.
And then, um... Finally, um...
Fuck you to Fox for having Family Guy at 8 o'clock because I want to watch it and I'm going to miss it.
Fuck you to people who don't have a TiVo.
Actually, wait, that would be me.
You know what?
Some of us aren't reliant on television for our sense of entertainment.
Yeah, and I don't need TiVo.
I have BitTorrent.
I'm done.
Alright, my turn.
I would like to give an F you to a general like just being tired and exhaustedness this weekend because I've been doing stuff like the past couple weeks in a row so I just you know I finally just kind of hit I was like I hit the point where I'm like I don't want to do anything at all ever except stay at home and lie in bed all day
so that's kind of the weekend I have so F you to laziness F you to the fact that we were a little bit disorganized in making E3 plans so we're kind of stuck in a not so great hotel but that's alright because at least we're going so I'm very happy about that by the way I am going for sure absolutely by the way I forgot to tell you thanks I found out so

Yeah, that would be great.
So, let's see.
Is that about it?
And F you to the fact that I have not one, not two, but three classes to teach next week and one of them is on a Saturday.

Amen to that!
I did that last week.
So, FU to Saturday working.
But then, I get the whole next week off, so I guess I can't bitch too much.
What can I say?
Alright, let's go over to Toadie and find out Toadie's FUs for tonight.
First one, from the Wednesday night.
Fuck pretty much the entire city of San Francisco for having like a transportation system that doesn't make any fucking sense.
Why do I have to drive like ten blocks down streets that don't make me make a left-hand turn?
Just to get to a parking garage that charges me $11 For like, oh, three hours and five minutes Kiss my ass, I wanted those two dollars back Anyway, uh, and then the other one I have is, uh Fuck California's statutory rape laws Going back to the Myspace thing earlier I wish I just lived, you know, a hundred miles away in Nevada Sixteen years old and you're done with it This is bullshit over here, I'm sorry I'm good Alright, that's it, I, no, no

FU to Family Guy for distracting me from the show and probably keeping me from even hearing the FUs.
Hey!
Get a VCR.
FU to anyone that doesn't see Crash.
It was amazing.
It's got to have a Best Picture nomination locked.
Okay, that's not really an FU, but more of me whoring Crash out.
Jin4576 says, FU to Finals Week and work sucking.
Ranma says, FU to the DDR fanboys and girls that are beefing about In The Groove.
It's just a game.
Relax.
Just because you suck at In The Groove, that don't give you the right to bitch.
Bring it.
It's already been broughten, sir or ma'am.
MPQ says, A big F you to children.
I hate children.
My sister has to take care of this doll thing for a school project and it drives me insane.
I hate it.
If it didn't cost $500, I would have broken it already.
I absolutely despise children.
AUKY says, My F yous of the week are, I didn't get to go to the launch party and then I ended up getting sick anyway.
Dope.
Alex L. Dubes says, my FU goes to my parents for leaving to Melbourne without me.
Because of them, I didn't get to play on the in-the-groove machine they have there.
I think it's the only one they have in Florida.
RPG King says, FU to only seeing my girlfriend once a week for the past month.
Hopefully that will change as we get closer to the summer.
Also, FU to bar huggers at our local DDR tourney.
They need to be weaned off the bar.

Dark Tetsuya says F you to Sure West.
Our phone line has been in and out of commission the past few days, thus limiting my internet.
And lastly, Dark Knight says my F you is to depression, end of line.
Oh, and F you to being broke and not having a car.
The end.
You guys are so angsty.
I'm proud.
We must talk about something.
Okay, what, Loki, what's up?
Well, we didn't talk about Red Octane's... We didn't, I was just about to get to it, if you'd hold on.
Well, I don't know where you're going, there's no set plan.
Yeah, you're right, that's the wonderful thing about this show, is that there's no set plan.
Orange Lounge Radio, no set plan.
Orange Lounge Radio and the Bush presidency.
Eh, we don't have a plan.
Guitar Hero is the new game that Red Octane announced this week but this is interesting because we're not sure to what extent they actually meant to announce this because they actually ended up taking down their website for it so they're kind of trying to pretend it didn't exist I think it's one of those cases where it was an E3 surprise it was supposed to be a surprise at E3 and surprise!
Somebody leaked your website out so now the whole internet knows about it so, oh well
Red Octane is going to be doing Guitar Hero for PlayStation 2 in the fall of this year.
It's interesting, by the way, to note that Red Octane for a long time, and I don't know if they still are, but at least I know previously when the Guitar Freaks games were big on PlayStation 2, they were doing five-button guitar controllers that were for use with the Guitar Freaks.
So it's very interesting that they're doing this.
Is this a game to try and promote sales of those controllers?
Or will it be a whole new controller?
We don't know just yet.
But I do know a lot of people have bitched about the fact that there have been no new Guitar Freak games.
And not to say that this game is going to be a Guitar Freak's clone.
We don't know, but we can kind of...
Basing my judgment only on their website and just how it looked, they put a lot of detail on that website.
And if that same amount of detail is in the game, it should be really good.
Well, here's what's interesting.
For those of you guys that are assuming that because Red Octane's putting it out means it's going to be like in the groove, you'd be wrong.
Because Harmonix is actually the folks that's developing me into this game.
Harmonix did, I almost said in the groove, a frequency and amplitude and they helped with Karaoke Revolution and
And what else did they do?
And there's another big one I'm not thinking of.
But Harmonix, you know, they've put out... Frequency and Apple II especially were games that kind of were underrated.
So it'll be very interesting to see what they come up with for this.
Plus, they must have their own studio or something, because they get these great original stuff, and then Karaoke Revolution had a lot of stuff as well.
They redid cover songs, but it was all pretty good.
So it should be interesting.
Now, they had a website at GuitarHeroGame.com, but it got taken down as soon as the website, you know, DDR Freak put out a press release on this, too.
And I believe it was either Games Are Fun or somebody had said it first.
I think it was Games Are Fun originally put the story out there.
So...
Everybody got a hold of this.
But this is the other interesting thing.
Now, this goes back to way in the beginning of the show.
You were talking about some guy was giving you their card and talking about Red Octane.
They also have a site called BAGuitarHero.com, which also got taken down, but they're actually having a contest to get bands in the game.
Uh-huh.
So maybe the guy you were talking to was one of these folks trying to get their music in the new Guitar Hero game.
I still think he was macking on me.
Maybe, but you never know.
Okay.
All right.
What is this game going to include?
Well, the site indicated before it got taken down that it would have songs made famous by Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and White Zombie.
Of course, when they say the term made famous by, you can pick up that it's going to be covers.
But, you know, Karaoke Revolution, the covers weren't.
I don't know, man.
White Zombie's pretty awesome.
I hope they have this game playable there.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Kenchia Hall, by the way, for those that are unfamiliar with E3, they basically have two huge halls.
What is it, West Hall and Main Hall?
I don't know.
Main Hall, West.
Main Hall, West Hall.
Main Hall is where Xbox was last year and all the other big developers.
Places like Electronic Arts.
Who else is in there?
Engage.
Engage.
Konami.
And the U.S.
Army.
Yeah, all those folks were in the Bain Hall.
The West Hall is another huge hall, and that's where Nintendo and Sony were last year, and where presumably these guys are going to be again.
And then some other, like, you know, not quite as big, but pretty big stuff, like 1up.com, I think, was in there, and Tech TV, when they were still around, had a booth in there.
And some of the folks that put out the plug your joystick into the TV thing, they were all in there.
Sega and Acclaim into little side rooms.
And then there's little side rooms, and that's where Sega, Acclaim, Atari, where they all were, like rooms along the way.
And then you have this place called Kensha Hall, and if you don't know where it is, you'll miss it.
It's underneath the main hall.
You go downstairs, and there's this other place.
And that's where they kind of stuck all the Korean games.
There was like Korean Alley.
And peripherals and stuff, and that's where some of the cool stuff was.
Yeah, what's interesting about Kenshiya Hall is that even though people joke about it and say it's a place where games go to die, it's one of the more interesting places at E3, it's really your hidden gems area.
That's where Classic Gaming Expo is doing a little preview, that's where the X-Tango game was, whatever happened to that?
O2 Jam, all that stuff was down there.
So it'll be interesting to see what Kensha Hall has this year.
Maybe Red Octane.
The competing company, the guy that I talked to from some other company and I don't remember who it was.
Yeah, whatever happened with the speakers.
Yeah, and then there was the guy who said they would send us the speakers to review on the show and we didn't get any.
Oh well.
Bummer.
Alright, so of course now that you guys have been asking in chat, will Orange Lounge be going again?
Yes.
Will we be taking pictures and putting them on the website?
Hell yes.
We're going to take tons and tons of pictures.
I am getting pictures with Booth Babes this time.
Son of a bitch.
I am not being the one holding the camera.
No, no, no.
I have to get the Booth Babe pictures.
It's not fair.

Wait, what is this, 1UP?
No, Myspace.
Oh, Myspace.
Oh, okay.
You know, if I had known I made ones, you should... My Myspace name is LokiOLR.
Did you put your picture on there?
No.
See, that's why.
Put a picture of you looking metrosexual and you'll have women from everywhere.
I don't have any metrosexual pictures.
We can fix that.
We'll get you a little button-up shirt and paint your nails or something.
Yeah, just wear what Andrew's wearing.
All right.
Okay, whatever.
Anyway, look, if you want to be popular, you've got to be metrosexual, because, you know, homos sell.
That's what it is.
And I am homo, so I can say that.
It's okay.
Okay, definitely, when we're making gay jokes, you know this show's over.
So please put the nail in the coffin of this show.
Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.
We'll start it off with Toadie, your final thought.
What exactly is this my final thought on?
Just, you know, whatever you want.
It's like Jerry Springer.
At the end of every show, he would give you his final thoughts.
What's your final thought?
Okay, I'm eagerly anticipating the ITG home version.
I hope that Konami doesn't fuck up the new Extreme 2 like they fucked up the other one.
I'm pretty sure that's already been covered on previous shows.
And... Yeah, I think that's it.
I'm good.
All right.
Loki, your final thought.
Work, work, work.
I'm hoping to play more Final Fantasy XI this week.
God damn it, I need to get back in my routine.
It's just, you know, the woman wants attention.
You know how that is.
And, I don't know.
It's just like, I had to play last night from like, you know, 10 to 2 a.m.
And I started getting tired.
You know what else is really awesome?
Golden Grahams.
And I bet you guys didn't know this, but if you pour enough water into a toilet, it will eventually flush itself.
Now you know.
That's pretty fucking cool.
And you know what my final thought is?
You know what else is pretty cool?
It's Golden Girls.
Cheesecake.
DarkSakura.
Oh, yeah.
That's hot.
That's hot.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Uh... I'm going to be doing some gaming this week before going to E3, just because I have to get back into the gamer mindset.
Last night, Dan and I, on our main machine, beat Metal Slug X. That game is fucking hard.
I gotta play that.
Metal Slug X was pretty damn awesome, though.
We got turned into zombies the whole game.
It was great.
Um... And... Well, mummies, really.
Um... And then, uh... I plan on doing some PSO tomorrow.
Uh...
Final Fantasy XI on Wednesday PSO Night on Friday the 13th I should be on Epdote 8 look for me I'm DarkSakura or CoverGirl or I forgot the other two that I have look for the ID card for GunstarHero because that's actually Dan's name since we're on the same account and that's it oh yeah one last very important thing reject false icons unless they're in DDR then worship them
Reject false DDRs Oh shit, put me on the spot here
