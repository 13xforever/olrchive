DarkSakura, DarkSakura,

2
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:55,565
I should be in love without you in it.

3
00:01:25,044 --> 00:01:28,766
They can't find the rules, like that's the way it's done, and that's the way it's done.

4
00:01:28,926 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm watching the stories, I'm speaking at the end of my time, I'm making my time, and there's nothing left to do, to do that job, cause we have a big kitchen.

5
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:55,125
and many more.

00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:11,317

45
00:08:12,018 --> 00:08:12,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, fair enough.

46
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,861

49
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:22,302
[SPEAKER_06]: You wouldn't hurt a ferret, would you?

50
00:08:22,362 --> 00:08:23,982
[SPEAKER_14]: Give me a ferret!

51
00:08:24,342 --> 00:08:24,862
[SPEAKER_14]: Hey, baby.

52
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,584
[SPEAKER_06]: Also joining us, say hello to the one, the only, Loki.

53
00:08:30,444 --> 00:08:34,065
[SPEAKER_06]: Also remember, it's the most motherly, you know, read.

54
00:08:34,165 --> 00:08:35,425
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to get there.

55
00:08:35,645 --> 00:08:36,525
[SPEAKER_05]: I was going to get there.

56
00:08:36,545 --> 00:08:37,686
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, just saying.

57
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:44,928
[SPEAKER_05]: I did that stuff yesterday because, you know, I don't want to interfere with today, you know, my sleeping and going to fries and whatnot.

58
00:08:45,328 --> 00:08:45,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, just

59
00:08:46,474 --> 00:08:49,657
[SPEAKER_06]: Take a moment to thank the womb where you were cooked.

60
00:08:53,439 --> 00:08:54,860
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to think about it that way if you don't want to.

61
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, also joining us tonight, we have some special guests.

62
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:02,166
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to somebody who was at the show a couple months ago, but he's back tonight.

63
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:02,907
[SPEAKER_06]: Say hello to...

64
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:04,743
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to introduce you.

65
00:09:04,763 --> 00:09:05,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Toadie?

66
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:06,424
[SPEAKER_06]: Pirate Power?

67
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:06,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

68
00:09:06,744 --> 00:09:07,465
[SPEAKER_06]: What do we call you?

69
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:12,407
[SPEAKER_07]: You could call me... I guess go by Toadie because that's what I'm on on like all 70,000 forums I'm on.

70
00:09:12,607 --> 00:09:13,307
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, Toadie.

71
00:09:13,407 --> 00:09:13,847
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you?

72
00:09:14,968 --> 00:09:16,088
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm getting sick.

73
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:17,389
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody I know is sick.

74
00:09:17,429 --> 00:09:18,529
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the hell away from me.

75
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:21,190
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a good four feet, so I think we're good.

76
00:09:21,631 --> 00:09:21,991
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

77
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:26,893
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the news studio now, though, so it's all... I could reach out and hug everyone right now in this news studio.

78
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:35,196
[SPEAKER_06]: You can check out the new webcam over at www.orange.com Of course, the only person you can see is me right now, but we'll try to get it around.

79
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:39,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, say hello to, and there's a reason you're here tonight, Tony.

80
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:40,118
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

81
00:09:40,158 --> 00:09:42,258
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're going to talk about that when we get into the show.

82
00:09:42,278 --> 00:09:43,019
[SPEAKER_07]: Sounds good.

83
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:47,100
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we like having you here for no reason in particular, but tonight you have a very specific reason for being here.

84
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,480
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.

85
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:47,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.

86
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:48,720
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll try not to let you down.

87
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:49,161
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

88
00:09:49,401 --> 00:09:51,501
[SPEAKER_06]: And also joining us tonight, say hello to Bug.

89
00:09:52,142 --> 00:09:52,482
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello.

90
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are you, sir?

91
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,643
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm doing great, sir.

92
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:10,280
[SPEAKER_06]: Our resident tech geek bugged, because then when you get tech guru Loki and tech geek bugged in the same room, it's just, I don't know, it's just all... It's like a board collective.

93
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,342
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's 20 degrees of dork in here right now.

94
00:10:12,842 --> 00:10:16,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, all sorts of interesting things we're going to talk about on tonight's show.

95
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:25,329
[SPEAKER_06]: I got to check out that In The Groove premiere party, so I definitely want to talk about that, and of course the reason Toadie's here, he went to it too, so...

96
00:10:26,368 --> 00:10:31,251
[SPEAKER_06]: Unfortunately, DarkSakura and Loki were unable to make it, so somebody's going to be so unfortunate.

97
00:10:33,292 --> 00:10:34,333
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, we'll get into that later.

98
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:38,635
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?

99
00:10:39,176 --> 00:10:40,937
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been on the fence for a long time.

100
00:10:40,997 --> 00:10:42,878
[SPEAKER_06]: So the question is, have I been swayed on in the group?

101
00:10:42,898 --> 00:10:43,859
[SPEAKER_06]: And what do I think of the home version?

102
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:44,699
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

103
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,340
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

104
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, so much news going on in the Mamani world.

105
00:10:50,322 --> 00:10:51,683
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

106
00:11:12,498 --> 00:11:20,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Starting this break, I figured since we're going to be talking about Extreme 2 at some point tonight, we should play some music from the first DDR Extreme that was released in the US.

107
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:24,062
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's some music, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.

108
00:11:24,282 --> 00:11:24,602
[SPEAKER_06]: See you then.

109
00:11:42,057 --> 00:11:42,978
Thanks for watching!

110
00:13:13,486 --> 00:13:16,527
New Sky 2 Forever, the green grass blows and the wind is dancing

111
00:13:35,843 --> 00:13:47,272
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be a much better sight with you with me If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own, baby Never felt so lonely when you came along

112
00:13:54,877 --> 00:13:57,079
[SPEAKER_14]: So now what should I do?

113
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:11,691
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm strung out, addicted to you My body aches, now that you're gone My supplies fell through Glad they gave me everything you had and more You craved my happiness When you made me feel joy and made you smile

114
00:14:22,546 --> 00:14:23,809
Thank you for watching!

115
00:15:09,421 --> 00:15:15,523
[SPEAKER_14]: I was into Cuba, now I'm stuck Diving, knowing it was you I keep on trying

116
00:16:11,999 --> 00:16:34,468
[SPEAKER_13]: Looking out a dirty old window Down below the cars in the city go rushing by I sit here alone and I wonder why Friday night and everyone I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down I saw

117
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,581
Thanks for watching!

118
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:03,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, we're back with Orange Lounge Radio.

119
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,584
[SPEAKER_06]: In that break, you heard some Kids in America.

120
00:18:05,644 --> 00:18:07,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Before that, Four Strings with Diving.

121
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:11,125
[SPEAKER_06]: Heather, You're Not Here, originally famous in Silent Hill 3, but then you got to dance to it.

122
00:18:11,205 --> 00:18:14,146
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Funk Boogie, all from DDR Extreme USA.

123
00:18:15,376 --> 00:18:16,357
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakra My week has been...

124
00:18:43,149 --> 00:18:43,709
[SPEAKER_17]: Interesting.

125
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:49,472
[SPEAKER_17]: I've basically been in a lot of pain all week, but most of it doped up on Vicodin.

126
00:18:50,572 --> 00:18:50,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Woohoo!

127
00:18:51,412 --> 00:18:51,953
[SPEAKER_17]: And Flexerol.

128
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:53,593
[SPEAKER_06]: Not woohoo for pain, but woohoo for Vicodin.

129
00:18:53,813 --> 00:18:55,234
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

130
00:18:55,474 --> 00:18:58,355
[SPEAKER_17]: I've managed to go two days until today without taking any Vicodin.

131
00:18:59,616 --> 00:19:02,517
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I started to hurt really bad again, so I took some more.

132
00:19:03,777 --> 00:19:05,818
[SPEAKER_17]: But it was all just work, school crap.

133
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:12,181
[SPEAKER_17]: I was going to go to the end of the group thing, and instead said that I can get out of my final, which is the first day of E3.

134
00:19:13,747 --> 00:19:18,208
[SPEAKER_17]: I gave up going to the in-the-group thing because my education is more important.

135
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:19,509
[SPEAKER_17]: Listen to all of this.

136
00:19:19,649 --> 00:19:21,949
[SPEAKER_17]: Your education is more important than video games.

137
00:19:23,950 --> 00:19:24,470
[SPEAKER_17]: Ignorant people.

138
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:32,232
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, what if you're going to go to one of those schools that you see in the G4 commercial that, you know, learn about how to play games for a living.

139
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,372
[SPEAKER_04]: Games, games, games, games, games.

140
00:19:35,553 --> 00:19:35,933
[SPEAKER_17]: No comment.

141
00:19:36,273 --> 00:19:37,053
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

142
00:19:39,034 --> 00:19:39,294
[SPEAKER_17]: But...

143
00:19:41,656 --> 00:19:41,876
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

144
00:19:41,916 --> 00:19:42,016
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

145
00:19:42,036 --> 00:19:42,136
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

146
00:19:42,156 --> 00:19:42,236
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

147
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:11,400
[SPEAKER_17]: and then went to Rapture, which was basically goth industrial and had a really good time.

148
00:20:12,221 --> 00:20:15,303
[SPEAKER_06]: I see a little bit of that reflected in your pre-show selections for this evening.

149
00:20:15,343 --> 00:20:16,423
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a little bit angsty.

150
00:20:16,904 --> 00:20:17,084
[SPEAKER_13]: No.

151
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:19,125
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't say angsty, but more it was tragic.

152
00:20:19,285 --> 00:20:20,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Your playlist was tragic.

153
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:22,467
[SPEAKER_13]: I had some Britpop in there.

154
00:20:22,987 --> 00:20:24,328
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit, but it was tragic Britpop.

155
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,209
[SPEAKER_17]: How is it tragic?

156
00:20:26,289 --> 00:20:27,090
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just messing with you.

157
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:31,101
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't see how Pet Shop Boys gets very tragic.

158
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:33,662
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, yeah, they do have some kind of angsty stuff.

159
00:20:33,682 --> 00:20:36,524
[SPEAKER_04]: Because a guy whines when he sings.

160
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:46,568
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, I've been in a good mood since then, except Friday I heard back from the other guy's insurance company.

161
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:48,849
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, that taxi cab company's insurance company.

162
00:20:49,169 --> 00:20:52,311
[SPEAKER_17]: Tried to call the stupid guy back because he left a message on my voicemail.

163
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And this relates to your car accident from a couple weeks ago, for those who missed it.

164
00:20:55,249 --> 00:20:57,310
[SPEAKER_17]: and he never called me back.

165
00:20:57,390 --> 00:21:04,354
[SPEAKER_17]: He apparently never came back to his desk and I need the money so if they flat out refuse to pay me, I'm suing them.

166
00:21:05,755 --> 00:21:08,776
[SPEAKER_17]: I've already talked about getting an accident attorney.

167
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:12,038
[SPEAKER_17]: And you know me, I will rip them.

168
00:21:12,498 --> 00:21:13,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Coming soon to Court TV.

169
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:14,659
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

170
00:21:15,019 --> 00:21:17,101
[SPEAKER_17]: But no, I'm going to give them... Take them on Judge Judy.

171
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:17,621
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

172
00:21:19,652 --> 00:21:22,174
[SPEAKER_17]: See, I have this thing called A Sense of Pride.

173
00:21:22,294 --> 00:21:23,515
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, how about Texas Justice?

174
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:26,838
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even go there.

175
00:21:27,979 --> 00:21:30,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Have you ever watched Texas Justice?

176
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:31,623
[SPEAKER_17]: I don't watch TV.

177
00:21:31,923 --> 00:21:33,645
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that where the loser gets hanged?

178
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they play it just before cops.

179
00:21:38,449 --> 00:21:41,732
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can just tell what the target audience is for this power hour.

180
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:43,734
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, sorry.

181
00:21:44,555 --> 00:21:44,675
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

182
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:47,423
[SPEAKER_17]: But I'm going to give him a fair opportunity.

183
00:21:47,483 --> 00:21:50,125
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm going to get a copy of the police report, have it full out.

184
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:59,516
[SPEAKER_17]: There's no way they really can't pay me because he was fully at fault, you know, pulled out in front of me when I had the right of way.

185
00:22:00,096 --> 00:22:03,500
[SPEAKER_17]: I wasn't on my cell phone and my headlights were on so there's nothing they can do.

186
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:05,777
[SPEAKER_17]: Ouch.

187
00:22:05,797 --> 00:22:05,877
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

188
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:35,485
[SPEAKER_17]: They didn't give me Vicodin, then they gave me Codeine.

189
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:38,387
[SPEAKER_17]: That sounded like I was drunk for days.

190
00:22:39,168 --> 00:22:44,111
[SPEAKER_17]: But, um... But, uh... I had a lot of fun yesterday.

191
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:48,534
[SPEAKER_17]: I completely went off my diet and had fish and chips, and then I had ice cream, and then went to Hot Topic.

192
00:22:49,195 --> 00:22:50,095
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, Instagoth.

193
00:22:50,976 --> 00:22:51,856
[SPEAKER_17]: To do some shopping.

194
00:22:53,718 --> 00:22:55,699
[SPEAKER_17]: Beer's... It was pretty good.

195
00:22:55,719 --> 00:22:57,160
[SPEAKER_17]: Cider.

196
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:57,500
[SPEAKER_17]: Cider.

197
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,221
[SPEAKER_17]: That's... What was that stuff called?

198
00:22:59,341 --> 00:23:00,082
[SPEAKER_17]: That apple cider.

199
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:01,123
[SPEAKER_12]: That was, uh...

200
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,751
[SPEAKER_12]: Blackthorn Dry Cider

201
00:23:18,448 --> 00:23:38,580
[SPEAKER_17]: and today I did my homework for my technical writing class I have to write a tutorial and actually the whole tutorial is not due for two weeks I have to review somebody else's tutorial but I'm just going to do everything at once but my tutorial is on how to make live journal icons using PaintShark Pro 8 are you going to post that on the interweb for anybody to see when it's done?

202
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:45,545
[SPEAKER_17]: sure, why not I'm hopefully going to have it finished by the end of the week and I'll put it up on the web you can see my homework

203
00:23:46,383 --> 00:23:47,344
[SPEAKER_17]: and tomorrow I get to paint.

204
00:23:47,604 --> 00:23:47,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool.

205
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:48,964
[SPEAKER_17]: I was supposed to do it today, but eh.

206
00:23:49,805 --> 00:23:55,928
[SPEAKER_17]: I went to bed at 4 a.m., sorry, 4.30 in the morning and got up at half past noon, so yeah.

207
00:23:57,589 --> 00:23:57,869
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, done.

208
00:23:58,409 --> 00:23:58,629
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

209
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,191
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's move on to Loki.

210
00:24:01,671 --> 00:24:02,571
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, sir, how was your week?

211
00:24:02,611 --> 00:24:03,072
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your day?

212
00:24:03,172 --> 00:24:03,872
[SPEAKER_06]: Put down the luminous.

213
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,053
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, okay, okay.

214
00:24:05,613 --> 00:24:07,394
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm getting further now that I actually have time to play.

215
00:24:08,575 --> 00:24:09,695
[SPEAKER_05]: No, my day was okay.

216
00:24:09,775 --> 00:24:13,117
[SPEAKER_05]: I went to Fry's to buy a bunch of supplies for my

217
00:24:14,777 --> 00:24:16,238
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get into that stuff later.

218
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:22,281
[SPEAKER_05]: Fry's rocks, but I try not to go there too much because I spend too much money.

219
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:27,485
[SPEAKER_05]: And then I went to a movie this week.

220
00:24:27,545 --> 00:24:31,227
[SPEAKER_05]: I went and saw Kingdom of Heaven, and that was Kingdom of Boring.

221
00:24:31,648 --> 00:24:33,649
[SPEAKER_05]: It looked like Kingdom of Boring from the trailer.

222
00:24:33,689 --> 00:24:34,870
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't believe you actually went.

223
00:24:34,910 --> 00:24:39,173
[SPEAKER_05]: This was Father-Son time, so I went because he wanted to see the movie.

224
00:24:39,473 --> 00:24:42,875
[SPEAKER_17]: Did it have any true historical reference to it?

225
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:43,867
[SPEAKER_05]: It did.

226
00:24:44,147 --> 00:24:47,128
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently the fighting, everything but the fighting was accurate.

227
00:24:47,748 --> 00:24:48,488
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I have to see it.

228
00:24:49,608 --> 00:24:56,570
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, it's just like, it was like, I've never actually sat through a movie where I said, okay, is it over yet?

229
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,010
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it just kept going and I really wanted it to end.

230
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:01,871
[SPEAKER_05]: The battles were anticlimactic.

231
00:25:02,351 --> 00:25:08,932
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I can sense that Ridley Scott was trying to make it climactic, but it was just a

232
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:10,708
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

233
00:25:29,966 --> 00:25:31,287
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else is happening, you know.

234
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:34,428
[SPEAKER_06]: My friend won free passes to see the Kingdom of Heaven.

235
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:38,190
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually entered an amateur strip contest, and that was part of the prize that she won.

236
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:38,870
[SPEAKER_06]: Go figure.

237
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:40,111
[SPEAKER_06]: Poor bastard.

238
00:25:40,691 --> 00:25:41,771
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that punishment or something?

239
00:25:41,871 --> 00:25:42,452
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

240
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:45,153
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, you should know better than taking your clothes off in public.

241
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:46,573
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to go see Kingdom of Heaven.

242
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:49,515
[SPEAKER_17]: I think I want to see it, though, just because I'm a big history nut.

243
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:50,495
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's too bad.

244
00:25:50,875 --> 00:25:53,677
[SPEAKER_06]: She had those advanced screening passes, and she was like, I don't want to go.

245
00:25:53,997 --> 00:25:56,458
[SPEAKER_06]: So she tried to give them to me, and I was like, I don't want to go.

246
00:25:57,349 --> 00:25:57,789
[SPEAKER_06]: E3 Oh, that's fair.

247
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,941
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I got a free game, another one, Area 51, and I have not played it.

248
00:26:54,573 --> 00:26:56,233
[SPEAKER_05]: and Contemplating Selling.

249
00:26:56,333 --> 00:27:02,655
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, Area 51's been remade again, but this time it's not a shooting game, it's a first-person shooter.

250
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:05,215
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just what we need, another first-person shooting game.

251
00:27:05,976 --> 00:27:06,536
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so happy.

252
00:27:06,716 --> 00:27:12,177
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, honestly, yeah, there's like so many goddamn first-person shooters out there, it's not even funny, but whatever.

253
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:17,298
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing, and just, you know, cleaning house and stuff.

254
00:27:18,874 --> 00:27:19,314
[SPEAKER_05]: Fun stuff.

255
00:27:19,454 --> 00:27:21,715
[SPEAKER_05]: I got to play Final Fantasy online the other day.

256
00:27:22,035 --> 00:27:22,635
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's finally.

257
00:27:23,315 --> 00:27:23,635
[SPEAKER_04]: Finally.

258
00:27:23,675 --> 00:27:24,015
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good.

259
00:27:24,035 --> 00:27:26,516
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, like, having withdrawals.

260
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:28,076
[SPEAKER_04]: Very cool.

261
00:27:29,436 --> 00:27:29,676
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

262
00:27:30,036 --> 00:27:30,396
[SPEAKER_18]: Addict.

263
00:27:32,317 --> 00:27:34,577
[SPEAKER_06]: My week and my day was okay.

264
00:27:34,797 --> 00:27:37,418
[SPEAKER_06]: I was kind of busy this weekend because a friend of mine was in town.

265
00:27:37,438 --> 00:27:38,078
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what's funny?

266
00:27:38,118 --> 00:27:45,380
[SPEAKER_06]: Because we went to GameStop the other night, and he had, like, $100 worth of credit that he could turn in to buy stuff.

267
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,600
[SPEAKER_06]: He just had it lying around.

268
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:46,920
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

269
00:27:47,219 --> 00:27:50,440
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how you just happen to have $100 worth of credit just lying around.

270
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,001
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, look here.

271
00:27:51,341 --> 00:27:54,282
[SPEAKER_06]: But no, he decided he wanted to get a PSP.

272
00:27:54,982 --> 00:27:57,723
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, if you're going to get a PSP, you have to buy Luminous.

273
00:27:58,363 --> 00:28:05,386
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think he was kind of starting to realize that when you get a PSP, not only do you have to start buying the PSP, then you've got to buy a memory stick, then you've got to buy a game.

274
00:28:05,486 --> 00:28:07,107
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really starts to add up pretty quickly.

275
00:28:07,127 --> 00:28:09,648
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not going to throw down $250 when you first get a PSP.

276
00:28:09,668 --> 00:28:11,329
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to end up throwing down more like $300 or $350.

277
00:28:12,785 --> 00:28:18,069
[SPEAKER_06]: So he decided he wanted to get Darkstalkers, and lucky him, he actually found a used PSP.

278
00:28:18,509 --> 00:28:22,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody had just traded it in that morning, so he ended up getting one of those, so lucky him.

279
00:28:22,752 --> 00:28:30,338
[SPEAKER_06]: And it appeared to be in great shape, and it already had like a memory stick in it that was like 200-something megs, so it was kind of nice.

280
00:28:30,718 --> 00:28:31,138
[SPEAKER_17]: That's not bad.

281
00:28:31,158 --> 00:28:33,280
[SPEAKER_17]: You know the one gigs are supposed to be out at GameStop.

282
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:37,042
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like about the best one you can get, so he got a really sweet deal on that.

283
00:28:37,943 --> 00:28:40,765
[SPEAKER_06]: But anyway, the point is that I was like, you have to play Luminous.

284
00:28:41,158 --> 00:28:42,438
[SPEAKER_06]: But he was like, I don't really have the money.

285
00:28:42,458 --> 00:28:43,299
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm like, okay, you know what?

286
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,319
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to get a PSP eventually.

287
00:28:44,379 --> 00:28:45,279
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just going to buy Luminous.

288
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,021
[SPEAKER_06]: So now I have a copy of Luminous with no system to play it on because he took it home with him.

289
00:28:50,861 --> 00:28:51,842
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh well.

290
00:28:52,982 --> 00:28:54,262
[SPEAKER_06]: I figure I'll get a PSP eventually.

291
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:56,023
[SPEAKER_06]: I just have to wait for the E3 stuff to settle down.

292
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:56,623
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see what happens.

293
00:28:57,203 --> 00:28:59,684
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, my week was just really busy with work.

294
00:29:00,584 --> 00:29:05,726
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to next week and E3 and everything just so I can take my mind off my real job.

295
00:29:06,466 --> 00:29:08,407
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I dislike my real job because I love my job, but

296
00:29:09,011 --> 00:29:11,312
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm looking forward to playing with this job for a little while.

297
00:29:11,452 --> 00:29:11,872
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

298
00:29:12,492 --> 00:29:12,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's it.

299
00:29:12,972 --> 00:29:14,272
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll talk about the rest of my week in a little bit.

300
00:29:15,233 --> 00:29:16,473
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk to Toadie.

301
00:29:16,553 --> 00:29:17,973
[SPEAKER_06]: What's up with your week and your day?

302
00:29:19,394 --> 00:29:20,114
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's see.

303
00:29:20,154 --> 00:29:23,415
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, I was driving around about half the day without my wallet.

304
00:29:23,455 --> 00:29:26,076
[SPEAKER_07]: That was really fun because I didn't know where the hell I left that.

305
00:29:26,156 --> 00:29:29,837
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought it might have been in some Mexican restaurant in like West Sacramento.

306
00:29:30,077 --> 00:29:31,277
[SPEAKER_07]: So that kind of freaked me out.

307
00:29:32,998 --> 00:29:33,778
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, that place is good.

308
00:29:34,058 --> 00:29:34,578
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

309
00:29:35,336 --> 00:29:36,297
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

310
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,181
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was like, hell with that!

311
00:30:06,621 --> 00:30:08,322
[SPEAKER_07]: And you love children, right?

312
00:30:08,582 --> 00:30:11,363
[SPEAKER_07]: Roseville Golf Land teaches you how to be a real good babysitter.

313
00:30:11,463 --> 00:30:12,244
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yes, yes.

314
00:30:12,304 --> 00:30:16,406
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually have a group of little kids down there that want to kick my ass.

315
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:17,426
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really funny.

316
00:30:19,107 --> 00:30:21,489
[SPEAKER_12]: Children are fine with the proper preparation and sauces.

317
00:30:21,889 --> 00:30:22,129
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

318
00:30:23,567 --> 00:30:24,948
[SPEAKER_07]: Get some basil going on there.

319
00:30:24,968 --> 00:30:25,728
[SPEAKER_07]: Wait, wait, wait.

320
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,028
[SPEAKER_06]: You have kids?

321
00:30:27,829 --> 00:30:29,009
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, okay, I say kids.

322
00:30:29,109 --> 00:30:32,391
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're like 17 or 18, but they're like 5 feet tall.

323
00:30:32,491 --> 00:30:33,091
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, okay.

324
00:30:33,271 --> 00:30:33,851
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really know.

325
00:30:33,871 --> 00:30:34,752
[SPEAKER_07]: And they want to kick your ass?

326
00:30:35,052 --> 00:30:35,292
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.

327
00:30:35,952 --> 00:30:37,133
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you fail them or something?

328
00:30:37,533 --> 00:30:37,793
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

329
00:30:38,153 --> 00:30:39,013
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.

330
00:30:39,153 --> 00:30:47,237
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it's because the Sacramento area is so anti-bar rape or not, and I'm like the biggest bar rapist in the entire area.

331
00:30:48,657 --> 00:30:50,298
[SPEAKER_17]: Big enough to be on a registry?

332
00:30:50,318 --> 00:30:50,398
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

333
00:30:50,808 --> 00:30:51,508
[SPEAKER_07]: I think so.

334
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:55,050
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I could get on Megan's Law for Bar Rapist.

335
00:30:55,170 --> 00:31:01,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Bugged, I know you're not too familiar with the DDR lingo, but when he says Bar Rapist, he doesn't mean that he goes into bars and rapes people.

336
00:31:01,392 --> 00:31:02,312
[SPEAKER_06]: He's talking about DDR.

337
00:31:02,632 --> 00:31:03,673
[SPEAKER_06]: Like you hold on to the bar.

338
00:31:04,513 --> 00:31:05,653
[SPEAKER_06]: I got that, ah, look.

339
00:31:08,014 --> 00:31:09,715
[SPEAKER_07]: At least now that you know about it anyway.

340
00:31:10,115 --> 00:31:11,055
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep it that way.

341
00:31:12,516 --> 00:31:14,277
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's about it for me.

342
00:31:15,797 --> 00:31:16,097
[SPEAKER_07]: Alright.

343
00:31:16,718 --> 00:31:17,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Bugged, how was your week?

344
00:31:17,578 --> 00:31:17,918
[SPEAKER_07]: How was your day?

345
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:22,618
[SPEAKER_12]: I got to deal with Pepsi Corporate Office on Wednesday.

346
00:31:22,718 --> 00:31:23,118
[SPEAKER_05]: Very nice.

347
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:25,199
[SPEAKER_12]: Yeah, they came out for a physical inventory.

348
00:31:25,239 --> 00:31:26,180
[SPEAKER_12]: My boss never showed.

349
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,641
[SPEAKER_12]: The owner of the company never showed.

350
00:31:28,361 --> 00:31:37,146
[SPEAKER_12]: They were more pissed that they didn't show than we were like 400 cases off, which is .0015% deviance.

351
00:31:37,166 --> 00:31:37,646
[SPEAKER_06]: 400 cases?

352
00:31:37,726 --> 00:31:38,887
[SPEAKER_06]: How many sodas are in a case?

353
00:31:39,547 --> 00:31:40,608
[SPEAKER_12]: There's 12 cans per case.

354
00:31:40,848 --> 00:31:42,509
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, that's not too bad, I guess.

355
00:31:42,609 --> 00:31:43,089
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, wow.

356
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:43,650
[SPEAKER_12]: Out of 272,000, 400 ain't crap, I think.

357
00:31:47,616 --> 00:31:51,779
[SPEAKER_12]: We ended up going up to Yuba City, In-N-Out, and the Rusty Duck.

358
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,440
[SPEAKER_12]: That is good food.

359
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,601
[SPEAKER_06]: What the hell is the Rusty Duck?

360
00:31:54,921 --> 00:31:57,143
[SPEAKER_12]: It's kind of like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos.

361
00:31:58,864 --> 00:32:02,947
[SPEAKER_12]: Or, well, it seems like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos, but it's got really good food.

362
00:32:03,247 --> 00:32:03,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

363
00:32:05,128 --> 00:32:05,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

364
00:32:07,249 --> 00:32:08,850
[SPEAKER_12]: And that was pretty much it.

365
00:32:09,571 --> 00:32:15,015
[SPEAKER_12]: I wore my Fugitive t-shirt yesterday, or Friday, whatever the hell that day was, to give my boss the bad news.

366
00:32:15,035 --> 00:32:16,355
[SPEAKER_12]: It says, Fugitive, you never saw me.

367
00:32:18,058 --> 00:32:20,279
[SPEAKER_12]: Drop the paperwork off and ran the fuck home.

368
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't it amazing what effect shirts can have on people's reactions to you?

369
00:32:27,442 --> 00:32:28,683
[SPEAKER_12]: I didn't tell them what it was all about.

370
00:32:29,063 --> 00:32:30,083
[SPEAKER_12]: Here's the paperwork.

371
00:32:30,604 --> 00:32:31,404
[SPEAKER_12]: Walked right on out and...

372
00:32:32,571 --> 00:32:33,131
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

373
00:32:56,102 --> 00:33:03,185
[SPEAKER_06]: I changed one of my pictures on Myspace to actually one of the pictures from the Live 365 Awards where I'm wearing one of those shirts that says tough guys wear pink.

374
00:33:03,665 --> 00:33:05,405
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's one of, you know, it's this typical Hot Topic shirt.

375
00:33:05,926 --> 00:33:12,248
[SPEAKER_06]: And I swear to God, like the day after I changed my picture, the next day I logged on and like 15 girls had all sent me a friend request.

376
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:14,189
[SPEAKER_06]: And none of them were over 18.

377
00:33:14,309 --> 00:33:17,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Lucky bastard.

378
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:17,810
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

379
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:18,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Lucky bastard.

380
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:19,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You like him young, huh?

381
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:20,911
[SPEAKER_07]: Damn right.

382
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:23,532
[SPEAKER_06]: If I wanted to be like a, you know,

383
00:33:24,255 --> 00:33:29,478
[SPEAKER_06]: and Pedophilia Act or whatever they call them, Child Molester, MySpace would be heaven.

384
00:33:29,658 --> 00:33:30,158
[SPEAKER_07]: It's great.

385
00:33:30,819 --> 00:33:31,819
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, seriously.

386
00:33:31,879 --> 00:33:37,442
[SPEAKER_06]: So if that's what you're into as underage girls, just dress metrosexual and sign up for MySpace.

387
00:33:37,803 --> 00:33:38,663
[SPEAKER_06]: I got it covered.

388
00:33:40,544 --> 00:33:41,825
[SPEAKER_06]: You've got the metrosexual thing down.

389
00:33:41,845 --> 00:33:44,226
[SPEAKER_06]: How many friend requests from little girls do you get on MySpace?

390
00:33:44,426 --> 00:33:47,168
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, see, everybody lies about their age, so you can't tell.

391
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:51,910
[SPEAKER_07]: So if they're 19, 16, you take off three years every single time.

392
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:52,931
[SPEAKER_06]: About three years is around.

393
00:33:52,951 --> 00:33:53,091
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

394
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,140
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

395
00:33:56,262 --> 00:34:05,489
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't lie on my age, but... I don't either, but... I mean, I just think it's funny, but I actually accepted all their frame requests because then they all leave me comments going, Oh, thanks for adding me!

396
00:34:05,769 --> 00:34:06,370
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh, yeah.

397
00:34:06,430 --> 00:34:08,572
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, Oh, that makes my ego feel good.

398
00:34:08,692 --> 00:34:10,513
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm like, I'm a MySpace friends whore.

399
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:11,934
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just add, like, random people.

400
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:12,475
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know who they are.

401
00:34:12,495 --> 00:34:13,596
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really care either.

402
00:34:14,016 --> 00:34:16,498
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, I'm not actually on there to meet people, you know?

403
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:20,281
[SPEAKER_06]: My sister on MySpace has a thousand friends.

404
00:34:20,961 --> 00:34:21,842
[SPEAKER_06]: One thousand friends.

405
00:34:21,862 --> 00:34:22,382
[SPEAKER_06]: Damn.

406
00:34:22,743 --> 00:34:23,043
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like...

407
00:34:24,195 --> 00:34:24,395
[SPEAKER_06]: Freezepop

408
00:34:40,214 --> 00:34:41,175
[SPEAKER_06]: has the thing on MySpace.

409
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:42,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I have Mr. T on mine.

410
00:34:42,817 --> 00:34:51,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. T. I love how they have, like, the really crap, like, you can have people randomly leave, like, clips of video and stuff.

411
00:34:52,005 --> 00:34:52,505
[SPEAKER_06]: And images.

412
00:34:52,585 --> 00:34:53,246
[SPEAKER_06]: I do that all the time.

413
00:34:53,286 --> 00:34:54,507
[SPEAKER_06]: I leave images on people's journals.

414
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:55,388
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

415
00:34:56,349 --> 00:35:05,417
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I mean, yeah, that's the worst, is my sister, because she has a thousand friends, if you load up her page, there's five videos that play all at the same time.

416
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:06,438
Oof.

417
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:10,585
[SPEAKER_06]: and one of them is like a bum begging for money and the other one's like a skateboarding video.

418
00:35:10,645 --> 00:35:11,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's like bum fights or something.

419
00:35:11,885 --> 00:35:12,185
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.

420
00:35:12,265 --> 00:35:15,487
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other one's like a skateboarding video and then some death rock song.

421
00:35:15,927 --> 00:35:18,108
[SPEAKER_06]: MySpace is where the internet goes to die.

422
00:35:18,288 --> 00:35:18,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It really is.

423
00:35:19,108 --> 00:35:23,630
[SPEAKER_06]: But sometimes you just want to feel cheap.

424
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:24,270
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

425
00:35:24,531 --> 00:35:27,572
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the allure of MySpace is because really... Everybody has one.

426
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,053
[SPEAKER_06]: It's an ugly site.

427
00:35:29,453 --> 00:35:31,634
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no point to MySpace, really.

428
00:35:32,114 --> 00:35:32,314
[SPEAKER_06]: But...

429
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:35,666
[SPEAKER_06]: yet I feel strangely attracted to it.

430
00:35:35,786 --> 00:35:36,968
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like the Fox Network.

431
00:35:38,449 --> 00:35:39,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That was low.

432
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,612
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know how to explain it.

433
00:35:41,473 --> 00:35:43,596
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of Fox Network, Family Guy in an Hour?

434
00:35:44,437 --> 00:35:47,620
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't tell people that because then they'll turn this show off to go listen to it.

435
00:35:48,181 --> 00:35:49,002
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why there's TiVo.

436
00:35:49,062 --> 00:35:51,385
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you have TiVo and why you have BitTorrent.

437
00:35:52,759 --> 00:35:53,319
[SPEAKER_07]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

438
00:36:14,378 --> 00:36:15,058
[SPEAKER_06]: MySpace, yeah.

439
00:36:15,778 --> 00:36:16,218
[SPEAKER_06]: End of story.

440
00:36:16,258 --> 00:36:16,618
[SPEAKER_06]: Enough said.

441
00:36:17,699 --> 00:36:19,939
[SPEAKER_06]: Notice how Orange Lounge does not have a community on MySpace.

442
00:36:19,959 --> 00:36:23,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a community on just about every other website out there, but we do not have one on MySpace.

443
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:25,480
[SPEAKER_06]: Although, I think Jamie had hinted about starting one.

444
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:28,500
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm planning on doing that since I actually have some free time to do that.

445
00:36:29,141 --> 00:36:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I'm surprised that you're on MySpace.

446
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:31,701
[SPEAKER_06]: Aren't you?

447
00:36:31,761 --> 00:36:33,581
[SPEAKER_17]: I joined it for some gorillas thing.

448
00:36:33,661 --> 00:36:36,402
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but have you actually looked at some of the other people's profiles on there?

449
00:36:36,722 --> 00:36:37,382
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, scary.

450
00:36:37,402 --> 00:36:38,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me send you my sister's page.

451
00:36:39,462 --> 00:36:40,763
[SPEAKER_17]: But, you know what?

452
00:36:40,903 --> 00:36:43,443
[SPEAKER_17]: I barely look at it, only when I remember to.

453
00:36:44,036 --> 00:36:44,736
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

454
00:36:59,364 --> 00:37:04,267
[SPEAKER_06]: But, Geocities, man, hosted some ugly ass websites.

455
00:37:04,648 --> 00:37:05,628
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously.

456
00:37:05,989 --> 00:37:12,233
[SPEAKER_06]: And it would be like, you know, page dedicated to Britney Spears and it has like the MIDI file embedded in the page.

457
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:14,734
[SPEAKER_05]: No, let's see.

458
00:37:14,774 --> 00:37:16,756
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, you guys should see if my page is still up.

459
00:37:16,956 --> 00:37:23,480
[SPEAKER_05]: It's www.geocities.com slash nightmare underscore hunter.

460
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:24,261
[SPEAKER_05]: And then...

461
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:27,388
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have many files embedded in your page?

462
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:31,851
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but I had a page dedicated to stupid people and how I hated them.

463
00:37:32,011 --> 00:37:32,832
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, now I have to look.

464
00:37:33,953 --> 00:37:34,813
[SPEAKER_05]: I had stories.

465
00:37:36,574 --> 00:37:43,038
[SPEAKER_06]: Geocities.com My friend on the East Coast just recently made a page dedicated to her new car.

466
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:45,780
[SPEAKER_06]: This is Geocities for you.

467
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:48,162
[SPEAKER_06]: She actually made the font color match her car.

468
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,244
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so it's Nightmare underscore Hunter?

469
00:37:52,024 --> 00:37:52,224
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

470
00:37:52,244 --> 00:37:53,025
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me see if I can find it.

471
00:37:53,885 --> 00:37:54,906
[SPEAKER_06]: I know this is great radio.

472
00:37:55,697 --> 00:37:57,358
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know if it's still up anymore.

473
00:37:57,378 --> 00:37:59,839
[SPEAKER_05]: I used to have a Lemmings page too.

474
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:00,579
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, there it is.

475
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,020
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god, it's really there.

476
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,040
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

477
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:05,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, this is great.

478
00:38:06,521 --> 00:38:08,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Last update, September 26th, 01.

479
00:38:09,503 --> 00:38:10,803
[SPEAKER_06]: Added DDR page.

480
00:38:10,843 --> 00:38:12,644
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see what links he has on the DDR page.

481
00:38:13,144 --> 00:38:14,325
[SPEAKER_06]: I had sim files at the time.

482
00:38:14,465 --> 00:38:20,007
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a Club Tropicana DWI and a Quake 2 theme DWI.

483
00:38:20,894 --> 00:38:23,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And then this is great, and you see this shit on Geocities pages all the time.

484
00:38:23,975 --> 00:38:25,436
[SPEAKER_06]: Links to BMS files.

485
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:26,376
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing under it.

486
00:38:27,116 --> 00:38:28,377
[SPEAKER_06]: That's because I erased them.

487
00:38:30,418 --> 00:38:31,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's the stupid people page?

488
00:38:31,898 --> 00:38:33,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Encounters with stupid people.

489
00:38:33,739 --> 00:38:34,219
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.

490
00:38:34,919 --> 00:38:38,641
[SPEAKER_06]: Warning, the following are actual encounters with actual stupid people.

491
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,602
[SPEAKER_06]: August 25th, Saturday.

492
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:45,243
[SPEAKER_06]: Location, Roseville Galleria Electronics Boutique.

493
00:38:45,643 --> 00:38:47,064
[SPEAKER_06]: Case name, Stupid Clerk.

494
00:38:48,331 --> 00:38:50,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It was Saturday in the late afternoon.

495
00:38:50,433 --> 00:38:53,015
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd never been to the Galleria before, so I thought, what the hell?

496
00:38:53,456 --> 00:38:58,160
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking for a Dex drive for my PlayStation so that I could upload my PlayStation saves to this site.

497
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyways, I found this third-party device called the MP Exchanger.

498
00:39:02,444 --> 00:39:05,366
[SPEAKER_06]: So I walk up to the counter to pay, and I was greeted with stupidity.

499
00:39:05,766 --> 00:39:08,229
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's an approximate dialogue of the conversation.

500
00:39:08,928 --> 00:39:11,109
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, so you find everything alright?

501
00:39:11,189 --> 00:39:12,030
[SPEAKER_06]: Looks down at my purchase.

502
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,131
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, yeah.

503
00:39:13,611 --> 00:39:16,113
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, man, I was waiting for this thing to sell.

504
00:39:16,193 --> 00:39:18,354
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea why anyone would need this for.

505
00:39:18,454 --> 00:39:20,495
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea how it works or if it works.

506
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:24,398
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, it copies game saves to your PC off a memory card.

507
00:39:24,498 --> 00:39:27,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, okay, would you like to buy insurance in case you break it within a year?

508
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,661
[SPEAKER_06]: No!

509
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:30,562
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, giggles.

510
00:39:30,742 --> 00:39:31,362
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that'll be $5,000.

511
00:39:31,422 --> 00:39:31,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Giggles.

512
00:39:31,662 --> 00:39:31,702
[SPEAKER_06]: Me...

513
00:39:37,026 --> 00:39:40,668
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, looks at the cash register display then hands the moron the correct amount of money, $29.95.

514
00:39:42,149 --> 00:39:43,370
[SPEAKER_06]: Clerk, hands me the receipt.

515
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:44,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me know if that thing works.

516
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Me, walking out of the store.

517
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:47,772
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

518
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,163
[SPEAKER_06]: How old were you when you wrote this?

519
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:52,523
[SPEAKER_06]: 21, probably?

520
00:39:52,823 --> 00:39:53,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

521
00:39:53,264 --> 00:39:53,984
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever!

522
00:39:54,004 --> 00:39:57,444
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think I actually went like that, but, you know.

523
00:39:57,704 --> 00:39:59,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's what you put, whatever.

524
00:39:59,785 --> 00:40:02,885
[SPEAKER_06]: Moral of the story, and by the way, moral is M-O-R-A-L-E.

525
00:40:03,145 --> 00:40:05,426
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, I was, you know, I don't care.

526
00:40:05,666 --> 00:40:06,526
[SPEAKER_06]: Morale?

527
00:40:06,566 --> 00:40:07,386
[SPEAKER_06]: No, wait, no, I'm kidding.

528
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:08,466
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind, I'm thinking something else.

529
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:11,407
[SPEAKER_06]: When you see it in all fables, it's always morale of the story.

530
00:40:11,707 --> 00:40:12,707
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear to God, that's what you see.

531
00:40:14,227 --> 00:40:14,447
[SPEAKER_17]: No.

532
00:40:14,567 --> 00:40:16,488
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear, like, I had books, and that's what it said.

533
00:40:16,708 --> 00:40:17,348
[SPEAKER_06]: Never mind, forget it.

534
00:40:17,368 --> 00:40:17,448
[SPEAKER_06]: Ugh.

535
00:40:18,959 --> 00:40:24,985
[SPEAKER_06]: Moral of the story, when dealing with the I think I'm funny clerk type, it's best to just ignore any attempt they make to make you laugh.

536
00:40:25,365 --> 00:40:27,587
[SPEAKER_06]: Failure to do so will only prolong the torture.

537
00:40:29,208 --> 00:40:30,189
[SPEAKER_05]: That's wonderful advice.

538
00:40:31,130 --> 00:40:32,151
[SPEAKER_04]: The more you know.

539
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:33,452
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, anyway.

540
00:40:33,933 --> 00:40:37,996
[SPEAKER_05]: The other one on there is some stupid guy at Burger King or like McDonald's or something.

541
00:40:40,519 --> 00:40:40,639
[SPEAKER_14]: Sigh.

542
00:40:41,018 --> 00:40:43,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if you want to check that out, you can visit his old website there.

543
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,461
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking great.

544
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, it sucks.

545
00:40:46,583 --> 00:40:48,344
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what other sites you have linked on here.

546
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:50,866
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to see what the cool sites were to visit back in 2001.

547
00:40:50,906 --> 00:40:52,688
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think I have any links.

548
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,029
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you don't have a links page.

549
00:40:54,109 --> 00:40:55,250
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody had a links page.

550
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:56,491
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't have a links page.

551
00:40:58,072 --> 00:40:59,093
[SPEAKER_06]: You have a WhoAmI.

552
00:41:00,595 --> 00:41:03,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Your birth date on here, by the way, is listed as 9-11-01.

553
00:41:03,217 --> 00:41:03,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Good job.

554
00:41:08,852 --> 00:41:10,693
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't want them to know how old I was.

555
00:41:11,433 --> 00:41:11,693
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's 01.

556
00:41:12,314 --> 00:41:14,515
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like, you know, a hundred-some years old, man.

557
00:41:14,655 --> 00:41:15,775
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm fucking awesome.

558
00:41:17,096 --> 00:41:17,396
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

559
00:41:17,476 --> 00:41:21,958
[SPEAKER_17]: Mine's still floating around somewhere on the internet, although GeoCities finally deleted it.

560
00:41:22,579 --> 00:41:25,180
[SPEAKER_17]: But I have DarkSakura's Mostly Evil Shrine.

561
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,901
[SPEAKER_17]: I saw that years ago.

562
00:41:27,521 --> 00:41:27,901
[SPEAKER_17]: That was me.

563
00:41:27,921 --> 00:41:28,242
[SPEAKER_06]: That's funny.

564
00:41:28,882 --> 00:41:32,244
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I had two, uh, a Best of Move and a Best of Move 2 site.

565
00:41:32,464 --> 00:41:35,105
[SPEAKER_17]: They're actually still up on the anime web turnpike.

566
00:41:35,762 --> 00:41:54,613
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what's funny is all these people in our chat room right now over at www.orangehunter.com they're all looking up their Geocities pages right now and all I see in the chat room right now is this OMG my site's still up OMG OMG I can't believe it's still there I haven't updated my site in like four years I'm surprised that's even up that's great alright

567
00:41:55,717 --> 00:41:59,559
[SPEAKER_06]: Cody, by the way, your girlfriend is in chat and wants to know that your girlfriend's listening.

568
00:42:00,259 --> 00:42:05,081
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh, yeah, I also just got a text a second ago that said, Bad Andrew, yes, I'm listening.

569
00:42:05,101 --> 00:42:06,161
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm just like, oh, shit.

570
00:42:06,361 --> 00:42:06,702
[SPEAKER_07]: Uh-oh.

571
00:42:07,082 --> 00:42:09,002
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, gotta watch what I say.

572
00:42:09,022 --> 00:42:10,843
[SPEAKER_06]: He didn't mean anything by the underage girl thing.

573
00:42:10,963 --> 00:42:11,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

574
00:42:11,343 --> 00:42:12,384
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all underage boys.

575
00:42:12,744 --> 00:42:13,264
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kidding.

576
00:42:13,584 --> 00:42:14,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

577
00:42:14,485 --> 00:42:14,545
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh...

578
00:42:16,112 --> 00:42:20,834
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, Toadie, as long as you have the microphone, let's talk about our fabulous party we went to.

579
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:21,374
[SPEAKER_06]: What night was it?

580
00:42:21,394 --> 00:42:22,035
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday, Tuesday?

581
00:42:22,055 --> 00:42:23,075
[SPEAKER_06]: Wednesday night.

582
00:42:23,235 --> 00:42:25,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So how did you get hooked up with this?

583
00:42:25,056 --> 00:42:31,059
[SPEAKER_06]: We went to our very first video game premiere, and it was for In the Groove, the new dancing game coming out on PlayStation 2.

584
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:38,262
[SPEAKER_06]: The controversial dancing game, I guess I really should say, because it seems like the dance game community is really divided over this In the Groove game.

585
00:42:39,002 --> 00:42:40,303
[SPEAKER_06]: If you've been living under a rock...

586
00:42:40,994 --> 00:42:55,594
[SPEAKER_06]: in the groove is this game that was created by and I think it's fair to say fans of the DDR series are folks that made this game but what they wanted to do was kind of improve on what they felt DDR was lacking on but it's in no way like DDR ever

587
00:42:56,557 --> 00:42:57,718
[SPEAKER_06]: No way at all.

588
00:42:57,738 --> 00:43:02,360
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's a completely different game, even though it has four arrows that scroll up that you dance to.

589
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:06,563
[SPEAKER_06]: In DDR machines, mind you, the upgrade, it's nothing like DDR.

590
00:43:06,643 --> 00:43:13,607
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mario versus, that's the greatest argument I read, is that DDR versus in the group, it's like Mario versus Sonic.

591
00:43:14,708 --> 00:43:16,008
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yikes.

592
00:43:16,228 --> 00:43:20,691
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't put a new sticker on your Nintendo case and suddenly turn it into Sonic.

593
00:43:20,711 --> 00:43:21,592
[SPEAKER_06]: But that's another story, forget it.

594
00:43:22,652 --> 00:43:23,953
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite how you feel about the game.

595
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,062
[SPEAKER_06]: We got to go to this party, and you got hooked up through ITG Freak?

596
00:43:29,083 --> 00:43:30,623
[SPEAKER_07]: I got up ITG Freak, yeah.

597
00:43:30,864 --> 00:43:37,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And DDR Freak was kind enough to hook us up with passes, because we don't count as a legitimate media source in the industry or something.

598
00:43:37,247 --> 00:43:39,269
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a shame.

599
00:43:40,049 --> 00:43:41,650
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't really worked with Red Octane in the past.

600
00:43:41,670 --> 00:43:43,511
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even think they know who we are, so it's cool.

601
00:43:44,632 --> 00:43:52,977
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, they do know who we are, because they offered us a partnership deal a few years ago when I was hosting Shaft.

602
00:43:54,437 --> 00:43:55,258
[SPEAKER_17]: How did I miss that?

603
00:43:56,078 --> 00:43:58,560
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we tried to do the whole Red Octane thing out of the head.

604
00:43:58,780 --> 00:43:59,601
[SPEAKER_06]: They know about us now.

605
00:43:59,841 --> 00:44:01,162
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them might be listening even.

606
00:44:01,202 --> 00:44:01,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Red Octane.

607
00:44:01,763 --> 00:44:02,003
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

608
00:44:02,983 --> 00:44:03,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

609
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:04,965
[SPEAKER_06]: I swear we're not going to bash this game.

610
00:44:05,045 --> 00:44:05,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, no.

611
00:44:05,525 --> 00:44:09,368
[SPEAKER_06]: I have things to say about it, but I'll ask Tony first.

612
00:44:09,388 --> 00:44:11,590
[SPEAKER_06]: How was your drive down, and what did you think when you got there?

613
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, we would have been on time, but, you know, hour of traffic.

614
00:44:16,132 --> 00:44:20,734
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when we actually got to San Francisco, we were like, oh, hey, look, it's the Fifth Street Garage.

615
00:44:20,754 --> 00:44:29,779
[SPEAKER_07]: So we ended up going down ten blocks because there were no left turns on any of them and down about another five streets and another ten blocks back to get to the parking garage.

616
00:44:30,259 --> 00:44:31,339
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a pain in the ass.

617
00:44:31,399 --> 00:44:39,203
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we were, I hope this guy's not listening, but there was this creepy-ass guy that just, like, approached me and my guest as we were walking up

618
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:46,814
[SPEAKER_07]: and just started asking us about music fees and royalties and how much he should charge Red Octane and stuff like that for his music.

619
00:44:47,274 --> 00:44:48,435
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, get away from me.

620
00:44:48,475 --> 00:44:49,075
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know you.

621
00:44:49,115 --> 00:44:49,875
[SPEAKER_07]: Please don't touch me.

622
00:44:50,016 --> 00:44:50,316
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

623
00:44:50,356 --> 00:44:51,276
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be a reason for that.

624
00:44:52,097 --> 00:44:53,898
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to do with something else Red Octane mentioned this week.

625
00:44:54,438 --> 00:44:56,099
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll get to that in a minute.

626
00:44:56,199 --> 00:44:57,380
[SPEAKER_07]: I was very confused.

627
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,781
[SPEAKER_07]: And he gave me his phone number when he left, which made me even more confused.

628
00:45:00,901 --> 00:45:01,222
[SPEAKER_07]: Hot.

629
00:45:01,702 --> 00:45:02,502
[SPEAKER_07]: Grant, call him!

630
00:45:02,822 --> 00:45:03,923
[SPEAKER_07]: Grant, call him!

631
00:45:03,943 --> 00:45:04,743
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to call him right now?

632
00:45:04,844 --> 00:45:05,524
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have brought it.

633
00:45:05,544 --> 00:45:06,644
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to call him right now on the show?

634
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:07,085
[SPEAKER_07]: No.

635
00:45:08,232 --> 00:45:11,753
[SPEAKER_07]: I wish I brought it with me, you know, but... Alright.

636
00:45:13,214 --> 00:45:16,455
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well, okay, so you got there, and what did you think when you got to the thing?

637
00:45:17,135 --> 00:45:24,337
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the place was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I think they were honestly expecting a lot more people to show up.

638
00:45:26,081 --> 00:45:29,682
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually surprised that there weren't as many people as I thought.

639
00:45:29,742 --> 00:45:31,723
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't get me wrong, I kind of liked it that way.

640
00:45:31,743 --> 00:45:33,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a really nice vibe there.

641
00:45:34,505 --> 00:45:36,305
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't really personally know a lot of people there.

642
00:45:36,325 --> 00:45:40,007
[SPEAKER_06]: I did run into a few people in the scene, such as yourself and a couple of people from other websites.

643
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:45,490
[SPEAKER_06]: Believe it or not, even though we're all quote-unquote competing websites, we all sit down and have drinks.

644
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:45,870
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fun.

645
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:49,132
[SPEAKER_06]: And good people that run the other websites in the community.

646
00:45:50,828 --> 00:46:00,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you think about it, like, DDR Freak had 10 passes to give away, but Monty Stone had 10 passes to give away, and the group Freak had 10 passes to give away, and if they all bring a guest, that's 60 people right there.

647
00:46:00,312 --> 00:46:02,533
[SPEAKER_07]: There was maybe 60 people in the entire place.

648
00:46:02,613 --> 00:46:05,755
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, I kind of was like, wow, and Red Octane had a lot of people there.

649
00:46:06,255 --> 00:46:06,495
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.

650
00:46:06,515 --> 00:46:10,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, most of the people there were from Red Octane, it seemed, or some type of press or something.

651
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:12,298
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if I can rant here for a second.

652
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:12,478
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.

653
00:46:12,498 --> 00:46:14,299
[SPEAKER_07]: This is something I saw on DDR Freak anyway.

654
00:46:15,279 --> 00:46:16,860
[SPEAKER_07]: What I kept seeing was all these, like, 15-year-olds...

655
00:46:17,748 --> 00:46:18,688
[SPEAKER_07]: Why won't they let me in?

656
00:46:18,728 --> 00:46:22,209
[SPEAKER_07]: Why won't they just let us have a pass that doesn't let us have alcohol or something like that?

657
00:46:22,229 --> 00:46:25,190
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, well, you're completely missing the point of what this is.

658
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:28,711
[SPEAKER_07]: The employees want to go down there and just get fucking wasted.

659
00:46:28,771 --> 00:46:33,673
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, they just, we completed a game, we're going to have a party, and they don't want to have to deal with 15-year-olds.

660
00:46:33,873 --> 00:46:38,394
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry to say it, but I mean, that's... I talked to a bunch of Red Octane employees there.

661
00:46:39,194 --> 00:46:39,775
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what?

662
00:46:39,975 --> 00:46:40,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of...

663
00:46:42,310 --> 00:46:43,291
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

664
00:47:11,227 --> 00:47:13,689
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the rotten apples would get in there and fuck it all up.

665
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:20,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to say that everybody over 21 is perfect, but luckily we lucked out.

666
00:47:20,135 --> 00:47:21,115
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody there was very cool.

667
00:47:21,155 --> 00:47:22,556
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't run into anybody I disliked.

668
00:47:23,377 --> 00:47:27,561
[SPEAKER_06]: And trust me, there's people over 21 that are stupid that I'm glad stayed far away from this.

669
00:47:28,141 --> 00:47:31,784
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think there's just a certain maturity level expectation.

670
00:47:33,265 --> 00:47:34,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just the way life is.

671
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:35,827
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to say it.

672
00:47:36,248 --> 00:47:38,870
[SPEAKER_06]: But someday you will have this conversation with...

673
00:47:40,265 --> 00:47:40,905
[SPEAKER_06]: Other teenagers.

674
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:42,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I don't know what else to say.

675
00:47:42,805 --> 00:47:46,746
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, more than anything else, I mean, there were so many Red Octane and Rockstar employees there.

676
00:47:46,786 --> 00:47:54,548
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was basically a party for them, not really for the fans of the game, so... Yeah, that's what I thought was also interesting about this.

677
00:47:55,248 --> 00:47:59,208
[SPEAKER_06]: The party really wasn't for hardcore in-the-groove players.

678
00:47:59,589 --> 00:48:06,190
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was the number one misconception about this, was that, oh, it was going to be the best of the best in-the-groove players showing off this game.

679
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:07,510
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas, in fact...

680
00:48:08,328 --> 00:48:10,231
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people were just average.

681
00:48:10,331 --> 00:48:14,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Tony was probably one of the best players there, and there was only a handful.

682
00:48:14,176 --> 00:48:18,801
[SPEAKER_06]: I could probably count them on one hand, how many 10, 11, 12 foot players were at this thing.

683
00:48:19,663 --> 00:48:23,247
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, when people are looking at me and going, this guy is good, come on.

684
00:48:23,808 --> 00:48:24,729
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you got moves.

685
00:48:24,809 --> 00:48:25,189
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen them.

686
00:48:30,087 --> 00:48:36,631
[SPEAKER_06]: So, yeah, so what I loved about it, though, is that there was an open bar, and the club was very posh.

687
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:37,732
[SPEAKER_06]: It was nice.

688
00:48:38,232 --> 00:48:40,033
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, these guys know how to throw a party.

689
00:48:40,633 --> 00:48:40,893
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, I agree.

690
00:48:40,913 --> 00:48:45,176
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite how you may feel about In the Groove, the party was awesome.

691
00:48:45,196 --> 00:48:45,916
[SPEAKER_07]: That was brilliant.

692
00:48:46,136 --> 00:48:48,418
[SPEAKER_07]: Free sushi, all that stuff.

693
00:48:48,498 --> 00:48:48,978
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, my gosh.

694
00:48:48,998 --> 00:48:49,859
[SPEAKER_07]: Drink all night.

695
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:51,980
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove totally knows... I'm sorry, Red Octane.

696
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:52,700
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop rubbing it in.

697
00:48:53,321 --> 00:48:53,561
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.

698
00:48:55,453 --> 00:48:57,114
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane totally knows how to buy my love.

699
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:57,894
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly.

700
00:48:57,954 --> 00:48:59,315
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, I had a great time.

701
00:48:59,375 --> 00:49:03,557
[SPEAKER_06]: If they could buy off my opinion on this game, this would have been a great party to do it.

702
00:49:03,637 --> 00:49:04,938
[SPEAKER_06]: It would have been Driver 3.

703
00:49:05,918 --> 00:49:06,198
[SPEAKER_06]: What?

704
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:10,340
[SPEAKER_05]: If they could buy off your opinion on this game, that game would have been Driver 3?

705
00:49:10,381 --> 00:49:12,181
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I would have been giving Driver 3 reviews of the game.

706
00:49:12,221 --> 00:49:14,262
[SPEAKER_06]: But okay, as far as the feelings for the game myself.

707
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:17,604
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so I got to check out the home version of In the Groove on PlayStation 2.

708
00:49:18,284 --> 00:49:23,207
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you guys know, I've always been... And when I first reviewed In the Groove, this is what I said about it.

709
00:49:23,909 --> 00:49:29,255
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not as bad as the people who are saying In the Groove should die and go away is saying.

710
00:49:29,295 --> 00:49:30,096
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not that bad.

711
00:49:30,876 --> 00:49:37,683
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's not as good as what the people who are saying OMG, DDR is dead forever, ITG for life is saying.

712
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:39,265
[SPEAKER_06]: It's somewhere in the middle.

713
00:49:39,866 --> 00:49:44,550
[SPEAKER_06]: That is how I still feel about this game even after seeing it at the show.

714
00:49:45,071 --> 00:49:45,932
[SPEAKER_06]: I was actually...

715
00:49:47,356 --> 00:49:51,879
[SPEAKER_06]: More impressed, I didn't think the game would translate as well to the PlayStation 2 as it did.

716
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:58,422
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you have to consider that a lot of this game was kind of homebrew, really.

717
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:03,305
[SPEAKER_06]: Step Mania was a homebrew thing, and it kind of evolved from that, right?

718
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:04,666
[SPEAKER_06]: So a lot of this game was homebrew.

719
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:09,568
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually translates very well and very smoothly into a PlayStation 2 game, so I was pretty impressed with that.

720
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:33,039
[SPEAKER_06]: as far as the game itself though it's it's it's in the groove you already have an opinion on this game honestly there's nothing I'm gonna say that's gonna change your mind one way or the other if you've played in the groove in the arcade you like it you're gonna like the home release if you don't like it you're not gonna like it so I I would recommend in the groove to dance game fans but I still would say if it's your first game

721
00:50:34,068 --> 00:50:35,649
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, you may want to weigh your options a little bit.

722
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:38,011
[SPEAKER_06]: I think DDR has some more beginner accessible things.

723
00:50:38,351 --> 00:50:41,573
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the groove is always going to be more for the hardcore niche player.

724
00:50:41,613 --> 00:50:48,217
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my... Actually, the home version actually added a new training slash beginners mode that's not available in the arcade.

725
00:50:48,297 --> 00:50:48,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

726
00:50:49,058 --> 00:50:55,022
[SPEAKER_06]: I did notice that, but I was still... I don't know, it's still... I don't know what it is.

727
00:50:55,162 --> 00:50:56,523
[SPEAKER_06]: In the groove, it just doesn't have that...

728
00:50:58,144 --> 00:50:58,665
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura

729
00:51:18,007 --> 00:51:26,850
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, and I know that might sound a little bit belittling, but it really is kind of a compliment that it is actually holding my attention for a new DDR.

730
00:51:26,910 --> 00:51:32,512
[SPEAKER_06]: Because, you know, it's unfortunate that Konami has kind of slowed down on the arcade stuff at least.

731
00:51:32,652 --> 00:51:34,253
[SPEAKER_06]: But this home version is a whole other world.

732
00:51:34,273 --> 00:51:35,593
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to get into later in the show.

733
00:51:36,094 --> 00:51:37,814
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to be a huge year for Dance Game.

734
00:51:37,834 --> 00:51:39,615
[SPEAKER_06]: That is now four Dance Games.

735
00:51:40,302 --> 00:51:44,252
[SPEAKER_06]: After this week, we know for sure there are four dance games coming out this year, and they all want your attention.

736
00:51:44,753 --> 00:51:47,620
[SPEAKER_06]: But honestly, most people that listen to this show are going to buy all four anyway.

737
00:51:48,222 --> 00:51:48,543
[SPEAKER_06]: I think.

738
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:48,944
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

739
00:51:48,984 --> 00:51:49,465
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

740
00:51:49,485 --> 00:51:49,826
[SPEAKER_07]: Probably.

741
00:51:51,751 --> 00:52:00,918
[SPEAKER_07]: The biggest compliment that I had of the game, and I really want to credit Red Octane for doing this, is that they kept the timing windows in the game the same as the arcade.

742
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:02,259
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that was cool.

743
00:52:02,359 --> 00:52:12,047
[SPEAKER_07]: That is my absolute biggest criticism whatsoever of all the home versions for DDR games, because you actually get used to playing on those and you go to the arcade and you just suck.

744
00:52:13,851 --> 00:52:14,871
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, you're terrible.

745
00:52:14,911 --> 00:52:18,253
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just off by a couple milliseconds and you start great attacking everything.

746
00:52:18,273 --> 00:52:19,493
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, what the hell's going on?

747
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:20,894
[SPEAKER_07]: At home, I'm triple A-ing this.

748
00:52:21,895 --> 00:52:24,336
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm really, really glad that they kept that the same.

749
00:52:24,376 --> 00:52:27,297
[SPEAKER_07]: It's actually going to be able to improve your ability in the arcade.

750
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:38,698
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you one thing I really liked, and this was something that really surprised me about the party, because I did not think I would be as impressed by this as I was, was Red Octane's Metal Pad.

751
00:52:39,099 --> 00:52:41,361
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was wondering if you were going to cover the Afterburner.

752
00:52:41,381 --> 00:52:43,684
[SPEAKER_06]: The Afterburner is amazing.

753
00:52:44,085 --> 00:52:46,307
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was, it's great.

754
00:52:46,828 --> 00:52:48,290
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the best Metal Pad I've played on.

755
00:52:49,226 --> 00:52:50,407
[SPEAKER_06]: But of course, I haven't played on that many.

756
00:52:50,567 --> 00:52:51,427
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's the best.

757
00:52:51,547 --> 00:52:52,527
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so responsive.

758
00:52:52,628 --> 00:52:53,148
[SPEAKER_06]: It's smooth.

759
00:52:53,328 --> 00:52:53,988
[SPEAKER_06]: It's great.

760
00:52:54,328 --> 00:53:00,671
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I own two personalized Cobalt Fluxes, and I can easily say that I would rather have two Afterburners.

761
00:53:01,151 --> 00:53:05,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you know the other thing I noticed about the Afterburners, which is awesome, the way they lock together?

762
00:53:05,753 --> 00:53:08,034
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can kind of play doubles with the pads locked together.

763
00:53:08,415 --> 00:53:10,776
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing the Afterburner is missing, seriously, is a bar.

764
00:53:11,336 --> 00:53:18,239
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I was actually talking to a guy named Atma, who works for Red Octane, and they actually have development going on for that.

765
00:53:18,959 --> 00:53:23,581
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if it'll actually go through or not, but I was offering some suggestions, of course, because it's the bar.

766
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:24,161
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, right.

767
00:53:24,421 --> 00:53:27,142
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, and you can't play these games without the bar, as you found out.

768
00:53:27,242 --> 00:53:28,743
[SPEAKER_06]: It's quite difficult for me.

769
00:53:29,163 --> 00:53:33,504
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's going to be a problem for this game coming home, but interesting creative solutions.

770
00:53:33,584 --> 00:53:35,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you tried something.

771
00:53:35,765 --> 00:53:36,866
[SPEAKER_06]: It didn't work too well.

772
00:53:37,326 --> 00:53:37,846
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried.

773
00:53:38,846 --> 00:53:40,967
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you try to do as a bar replacement at the party?

774
00:53:41,087 --> 00:53:45,789
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, since I didn't really have any chairs there, I basically just grabbed one of these metal bar stools.

775
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:48,212
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw my ass on the picture gallery multiple times.

776
00:53:48,232 --> 00:53:48,512
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, DarkSakura.

777
00:54:16,142 --> 00:54:19,024
[SPEAKER_17]: I was in the other room at that moment, but I heard Afterburner.

778
00:54:19,705 --> 00:54:22,847
[SPEAKER_17]: Not only are they ripping off DDR, now they're ripping off Sega.

779
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:26,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, well, well, wait.

780
00:54:26,690 --> 00:54:32,374
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all know that this is not... The new Afterburner pad has nothing to do with everybody's favorite jet-flying game.

781
00:54:32,594 --> 00:54:32,934
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I know.

782
00:54:33,055 --> 00:54:35,676
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, but this just makes me want to hook up my 32X.

783
00:54:36,337 --> 00:54:36,917
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, you're teasing.

784
00:54:38,573 --> 00:54:44,275
[SPEAKER_06]: But the Afterburner pads, honestly, I was more impressed with the Afterburner pads than anything else in the show.

785
00:54:44,295 --> 00:54:45,055
[SPEAKER_07]: I thought they were great.

786
00:54:45,135 --> 00:54:50,756
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, is that the first metal pad that really has a system of, like, the depressed arrows like the Arcade?

787
00:54:51,036 --> 00:54:56,758
[SPEAKER_07]: I know the Cobalt Flux is completely flat, and I've had, like, a MyMyBox, which was pretty much flat also.

788
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:58,858
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to ask our expert here, because I don't know, really.

789
00:54:58,918 --> 00:55:00,219
[SPEAKER_07]: Your pads that you built had it.

790
00:55:00,679 --> 00:55:04,540
[SPEAKER_05]: My pads rock, that's why, because I put my hard, you know...

791
00:55:06,151 --> 00:55:10,754
[SPEAKER_05]: I put a lot of hard effort into getting them, well, built.

792
00:55:13,095 --> 00:55:15,897
[SPEAKER_05]: Working, it's a little different.

793
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:17,018
[SPEAKER_05]: But my pads rock.

794
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:18,038
[SPEAKER_05]: They weigh a ton.

795
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:23,362
[SPEAKER_05]: But as far as depressors, most of them are like flat and they're lame.

796
00:55:23,742 --> 00:55:26,604
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, I remember those old metal pads you can get off of eBay or whatever.

797
00:55:26,624 --> 00:55:28,845
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even remember where I bought metal pads from.

798
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:32,607
[SPEAKER_05]: I ended up selling them to someone and the first time I stepped on it, it bent.

799
00:55:33,588 --> 00:55:33,868
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like,

800
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:35,460
[SPEAKER_05]: Why did it bend?

801
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:36,521
[SPEAKER_05]: That's weird.

802
00:55:36,821 --> 00:55:38,121
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's made of tinfoil.

803
00:55:39,622 --> 00:55:44,943
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry if I sound like I was knocking your metal pads, Loki, but these pads actually worked for more than 15 minutes.

804
00:55:45,523 --> 00:55:47,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Because mine aren't groundy, you dumbass.

805
00:55:47,884 --> 00:55:48,264
[SPEAKER_06]: Shit.

806
00:55:48,284 --> 00:55:52,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Once I put that wire on, man, those fucking pads are going to rock.

807
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:55,767
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, but these pads at the show, they were taking abuse.

808
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:57,647
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw girls in heels playing on these pads.

809
00:55:57,987 --> 00:56:00,568
[SPEAKER_06]: They were taking a lot of abuse, and they were still holding up great.

810
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:01,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Stupid women.

811
00:56:02,549 --> 00:56:03,129
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop it!

812
00:56:04,065 --> 00:56:04,826
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR is dead!

813
00:56:04,846 --> 00:56:06,267
[SPEAKER_06]: If you still play DDR, you're a fag!

814
00:56:31,072 --> 00:56:32,294
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for watching!

815
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,519
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care how you spin it.

816
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:47,642
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove is a deviation of the DDR game.

817
00:56:48,103 --> 00:56:55,848
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot spin this any other way that I will believe you that this is not some type of at least inspired by DDR.

818
00:56:55,909 --> 00:56:57,270
[SPEAKER_06]: You cannot spin it.

819
00:56:57,530 --> 00:56:59,631
[SPEAKER_17]: Had there been no DDR, there would be no In the Groove.

820
00:56:59,831 --> 00:57:00,312
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.

821
00:57:00,332 --> 00:57:00,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Period.

822
00:57:00,832 --> 00:57:01,713
[SPEAKER_06]: End of sentence.

823
00:57:01,753 --> 00:57:02,593
[SPEAKER_06]: That sums it up there.

824
00:57:03,274 --> 00:57:04,695
[SPEAKER_06]: And these kids out there that are just

825
00:57:05,293 --> 00:57:09,515
[SPEAKER_06]: saying, you know, DDR is dead, have no respect for where In The Groove came from.

826
00:57:09,876 --> 00:57:12,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, DDR fans, build In The Groove!

827
00:57:15,179 --> 00:57:15,459
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

828
00:57:16,239 --> 00:57:21,742
[SPEAKER_05]: And they also built stupid, uh, what was it, that dancing stage, um, Unleashed or whatever.

829
00:57:23,623 --> 00:57:29,667
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, well, stupid Konami, they can't get anything right as far as, like, you know, the new, uh, arcade games.

830
00:57:29,727 --> 00:57:31,908
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I swear, you know,

831
00:57:32,856 --> 00:57:33,236
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

832
00:57:34,597 --> 00:57:38,580
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really curious to see what they're going to come up with for this year's E3.

833
00:57:40,801 --> 00:57:41,202
[SPEAKER_05]: EyeToy.

834
00:57:41,222 --> 00:57:42,823
[SPEAKER_06]: That was a great idea.

835
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:44,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do that again.

836
00:57:44,164 --> 00:57:44,564
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

837
00:57:44,604 --> 00:57:46,666
[SPEAKER_06]: I think people were way too harsh on the EyeToy thing.

838
00:57:46,766 --> 00:57:48,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, yeah.

839
00:57:48,607 --> 00:57:50,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Wait, wait, wait.

840
00:57:50,088 --> 00:57:50,488
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on.

841
00:57:50,528 --> 00:57:51,049
[SPEAKER_06]: Hold on a minute.

842
00:57:51,709 --> 00:57:52,990
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to get too far off topic here.

843
00:57:53,010 --> 00:57:54,051
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not done within the groove yet.

844
00:57:54,111 --> 00:57:56,192
[SPEAKER_06]: But the EyeToy thing, look at it this way.

845
00:57:56,772 --> 00:58:00,395
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of us that are into DDR and all that stuff, it was kind of silly.

846
00:58:01,033 --> 00:58:03,934
[SPEAKER_06]: But let's face it, DDR was not just made for us.

847
00:58:04,094 --> 00:58:07,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It was also made for nine-year-old girls to have at their slumber parties.

848
00:58:07,476 --> 00:58:08,256
[SPEAKER_06]: Like it or not.

849
00:58:09,076 --> 00:58:12,097
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a topic I'm going to bring back later when we start talking about Xtreme 2.

850
00:58:13,038 --> 00:58:16,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Nine-year-old girls in their slumber parties think this iToy shit's hilarious.

851
00:58:17,099 --> 00:58:18,120
[SPEAKER_06]: Not that I know firsthand.

852
00:58:18,140 --> 00:58:20,941
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just, you know, heard things and read about them on certain internet websites.

853
00:58:22,302 --> 00:58:23,703
[SPEAKER_06]: iToy was not made for you.

854
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:25,484
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not made for you, the fan.

855
00:58:25,624 --> 00:58:28,687
[SPEAKER_06]: It was made to make DDR more accessible and more showy and flashy.

856
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:33,550
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why DDR does so well, because it's such a showy, flashy game.

857
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:37,513
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's something that In the Groove, by the way, completely lacks, is showiness and flashiness.

858
00:58:37,813 --> 00:58:42,276
[SPEAKER_06]: In the Groove looks like this industrial, sad, sad, gothic thing.

859
00:58:43,697 --> 00:58:47,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Not to knock the game quality, because it's a fun game, but it looks bad.

860
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:48,120
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks too American.

861
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:49,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, sadly, it looks too American.

862
00:58:50,482 --> 00:58:50,682
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

863
00:58:51,870 --> 00:59:03,440
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, because I love the eye toy game where you hit the stupid ball around and you spend like 15 minutes trying to get the ball to go where you want it to go and it sucks and it's so frustrating.

864
00:59:03,620 --> 00:59:09,725
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm already pissed off at Sonic Team for not doing a real Knights game and instead doing Knights in that eye toy collection.

865
00:59:10,905 --> 00:59:11,066
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

866
00:59:12,207 --> 00:59:17,751
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I remember that Sega collection thing that they were doing the eye toy with at E3.

867
00:59:18,291 --> 00:59:18,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh-huh.

868
00:59:19,032 --> 00:59:20,273
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, there's a Knights game in it.

869
00:59:21,178 --> 00:59:22,379
[SPEAKER_17]: Why couldn't they just make Knights?

870
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:25,041
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, I had to rant about iToy.

871
00:59:25,101 --> 00:59:27,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, why couldn't they just freaking make Samba on PS2?

872
00:59:27,583 --> 00:59:34,508
[SPEAKER_17]: Dude, Sonic Team just needs to be given a whole shitload of money and do nothing but make games that I tell them to.

873
00:59:34,748 --> 00:59:41,373
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, and of course we have somebody in our chatroom right now that says, SSJ100Matt says, iToy games equal great games to play with your penis.

874
00:59:43,014 --> 00:59:45,096
[SPEAKER_06]: You always know somebody's gotta be the jokester.

875
00:59:46,277 --> 00:59:46,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Ass!

876
00:59:46,977 --> 00:59:48,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that'll make that work.

877
00:59:48,778 --> 00:59:49,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to In The Groove.

878
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:53,576
[SPEAKER_06]: I know.

879
00:59:53,976 --> 00:59:56,858
[SPEAKER_06]: Back to In the Groove for a minute, alright, before we get on all these other tangents.

880
00:59:56,898 --> 00:59:57,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so In the Groove.

881
00:59:58,139 --> 00:59:59,000
[SPEAKER_06]: Do I recommend the game?

882
00:59:59,901 --> 01:00:01,963
[SPEAKER_06]: If you like In the Groove, yes.

883
01:00:02,123 --> 01:00:04,745
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't know how you feel about it, at least check it out.

884
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:05,966
[SPEAKER_06]: Form your own opinion.

885
01:00:06,006 --> 01:00:07,227
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't listen to people on the internet.

886
01:00:07,447 --> 01:00:08,729
[SPEAKER_06]: That is my opinion on In the Groove.

887
01:00:08,769 --> 01:00:09,990
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't listen to people on the internet.

888
01:00:10,010 --> 01:00:11,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Play the game for yourself and form your own opinion.

889
01:00:12,332 --> 01:00:12,652
[SPEAKER_05]: There it is.

890
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:15,494
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, you know what this is right here?

891
01:00:15,674 --> 01:00:19,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is the equivalent of, like, say...

892
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:37,641
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you've got, you know, like your hair care products and stuff like that, okay, and you've got, you know, for women they have their conditioner and stuff, and then, you know, guys won't buy that crap because they're like, that's gay, I'm not gonna play that, I'm not gonna put that gay shit in my hair, so then they come up with like something cool, EXTREME GEL!

893
01:00:38,121 --> 01:00:40,162
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so you buy this extreme gel.

894
01:00:40,182 --> 01:00:43,903
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically the same damn thing as the women's product, but repackaged, so you buy it.

895
01:00:44,083 --> 01:00:45,344
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what In The Groove is.

896
01:00:45,464 --> 01:00:50,405
[SPEAKER_05]: In The Groove is the Dance Dance Revolution game that you can play and not feel gay about.

897
01:00:50,805 --> 01:00:51,686
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what it is.

898
01:00:53,306 --> 01:00:58,368
[SPEAKER_06]: That is quite possibly the best analogy for this whole damn thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

899
01:00:58,448 --> 01:00:59,128
[SPEAKER_06]: Congratulations.

900
01:00:59,208 --> 01:00:59,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Hats off to you.

901
01:01:01,109 --> 01:01:02,850
[SPEAKER_06]: People should post that on every forum.

902
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:04,610
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all it is.

903
01:01:04,650 --> 01:01:05,370
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really what it is.

904
01:01:05,390 --> 01:01:06,071
[SPEAKER_06]: You better copyright that.

905
01:01:06,091 --> 01:01:06,871
[SPEAKER_06]: You better copyright it.

906
01:01:07,313 --> 01:01:09,315
[SPEAKER_17]: It's the men's suave of the dancing world.

907
01:01:10,196 --> 01:01:11,798
[SPEAKER_06]: It's pH balance for a guy.

908
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:13,981
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly, they have that crap now.

909
01:01:14,381 --> 01:01:16,003
[SPEAKER_05]: pH balance for my ass.

910
01:01:16,724 --> 01:01:19,867
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't pH balance, you know, just put that shit on.

911
01:01:19,887 --> 01:01:21,129
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, it burns!

912
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:23,532
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways, yeah.

913
01:01:24,112 --> 01:01:25,554
[SPEAKER_07]: Toadie, your thoughts.

914
01:01:27,034 --> 01:01:30,516
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I've already kind of been an ITG fanboy.

915
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:34,638
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, the first time I played it, I really thought it was pretty much just gimmicky bullshit.

916
01:01:34,698 --> 01:01:36,959
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I'm like, mines, you know, what the fuck is this?

917
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:37,919
[SPEAKER_07]: Who cares, you know?

918
01:01:38,379 --> 01:01:40,500
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually tried to do my first hand plant the other day.

919
01:01:40,520 --> 01:01:42,061
[SPEAKER_07]: I will never do that again.

920
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:44,762
[SPEAKER_07]: I burst a couple veins in my hand.

921
01:01:44,842 --> 01:01:45,663
[SPEAKER_07]: I threw out my back.

922
01:01:46,863 --> 01:01:47,323
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

923
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:49,624
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, the more I played it, the more I liked it.

924
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:52,746
[SPEAKER_07]: And, like I said, they're not making any more DDR, so, I mean, I'm going to keep playing it.

925
01:01:52,826 --> 01:01:55,087
[SPEAKER_07]: But, I mean, I was impressed with the home version.

926
01:01:56,646 --> 01:02:00,588
[SPEAKER_07]: They got some stuff from ITG2 on here, so it should be pretty good.

927
01:02:01,309 --> 01:02:03,570
[SPEAKER_07]: They didn't fuck with the timing windows, so I'm happy.

928
01:02:05,031 --> 01:02:05,932
[SPEAKER_07]: I got it pre-ordered.

929
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:08,053
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, I'm going to pick it up.

930
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:12,296
[SPEAKER_06]: My opinion of In the Groove is, even though I say I'm on the fence, it's favorable.

931
01:02:12,456 --> 01:02:15,918
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's only going to be like $30, so I'm going to pick it up.

932
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:17,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Why not?

933
01:02:17,679 --> 01:02:19,260
[SPEAKER_06]: The DDR games aren't going to be out until fall.

934
01:02:19,861 --> 01:02:20,861
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm going to pick up these games.

935
01:02:21,502 --> 01:02:23,103
[SPEAKER_07]: I think most people will.

936
01:02:25,806 --> 01:02:27,686
[SPEAKER_06]: I will soon, jerk.

937
01:02:28,174 --> 01:02:28,414
[SPEAKER_07]: RedOctane

938
01:02:56,833 --> 01:02:58,015
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

939
01:03:10,839 --> 01:03:12,640
[SPEAKER_06]: Hit me up offline and I'll give you the address.

940
01:03:12,981 --> 01:03:15,122
[SPEAKER_06]: But that rumor as it stands is completely false.

941
01:03:15,202 --> 01:03:17,784
[SPEAKER_06]: We got shirts and keychains and other cute little things.

942
01:03:17,844 --> 01:03:18,425
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots of beer.

943
01:03:19,125 --> 01:03:20,486
[SPEAKER_06]: And alcohol, which was great.

944
01:03:21,187 --> 01:03:22,608
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, Red Octane, No South Road Party.

945
01:03:22,628 --> 01:03:23,769
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought that bar was very cool.

946
01:03:24,709 --> 01:03:27,632
[SPEAKER_06]: I loved how we took over the media room at one point towards the end of the evening.

947
01:03:27,712 --> 01:03:28,652
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a great time.

948
01:03:28,692 --> 01:03:29,353
[SPEAKER_06]: Met some good people.

949
01:03:30,334 --> 01:03:37,539
[SPEAKER_06]: Honestly, I think what this did, it made me a little more favorable of the In The Groove community as a whole because I know now that there are good people around.

950
01:03:37,919 --> 01:03:53,122
[SPEAKER_06]: I think between that and the news that Red Octane came out with later in the week, I'm actually really respecting what Red Octane's trying to do.

951
01:03:54,107 --> 01:03:54,748
[SPEAKER_06]: RedOctane

952
01:04:23,436 --> 01:04:25,737
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, for now, I think what we'll do is we'll do a little bit of a break.

953
01:04:25,977 --> 01:04:28,278
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, actually, I want to respond to some chatroom comments before we get a break.

954
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:35,081
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing somebody said, Kuwabara, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, said, I don't feel gay when I play DDR.

955
01:04:35,462 --> 01:04:36,302
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, okay.

956
01:04:37,205 --> 01:04:41,206
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's true, you shouldn't, because dance games do not have a sexuality.

957
01:04:41,546 --> 01:04:47,388
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Loki's comment, though, you have to remember, is more towards what the general public views these games as.

958
01:04:47,508 --> 01:05:01,413
[SPEAKER_06]: We, as you folks who are geeky enough to tune into a music station that is towards these dance games, and, you know, us in the community, we know it's not gay, and we know, we have fun with it, but you have to remember, the average, you know, Joe Q. Jock guy that comes to an arcade,

959
01:05:01,894 --> 01:05:02,034
[SPEAKER_06]: R.V.G.O.

960
01:05:21,451 --> 01:05:23,533
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but they don't exactly call you queer.

961
01:05:24,173 --> 01:05:27,837
[SPEAKER_17]: But no, but they still get up and act asshole-ish on the machine.

962
01:05:28,217 --> 01:05:32,320
[SPEAKER_17]: So, my favorite circumstance is when I went up to these guys and said, Okay, I'll pay.

963
01:05:32,821 --> 01:05:33,622
[SPEAKER_17]: But I picked the songs.

964
01:05:35,723 --> 01:05:37,005
[SPEAKER_17]: And what was it that I picked?

965
01:05:37,045 --> 01:05:38,966
[SPEAKER_17]: It was something fairly vicious, What Rhythm And Police.

966
01:05:38,986 --> 01:05:40,067
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was something pretty mean.

967
01:05:40,408 --> 01:05:40,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

968
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:41,028
[SPEAKER_07]: It was cool.

969
01:05:41,168 --> 01:05:43,931
[SPEAKER_17]: And they just stopped there and went, Ugh.

970
01:05:44,933 --> 01:05:47,536
[SPEAKER_07]: I won't challenge anybody unless it's for like $40 a game.

971
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:48,757
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, don't waste my time.

972
01:05:50,338 --> 01:05:53,181
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to play a five-time tournament winner?

973
01:05:53,201 --> 01:05:54,102
[SPEAKER_07]: $40 a game, asshole.

974
01:05:54,122 --> 01:05:54,783
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you're doing.

975
01:05:54,823 --> 01:05:56,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not wasting my time with you.

976
01:05:56,725 --> 01:06:01,129
[SPEAKER_17]: But my whole point with this was that I showed them just exactly how stupid they were being.

977
01:06:01,149 --> 01:06:01,970
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's great.

978
01:06:02,070 --> 01:06:05,133
[SPEAKER_17]: And then usually those other people that they get up and do that, I have them kicked out of the arcade.

979
01:06:05,153 --> 01:06:05,974
[SPEAKER_06]: You made a kid cry once.

980
01:06:06,414 --> 01:06:07,595
[SPEAKER_06]: That was the most beautiful thing ever.

981
01:06:07,695 --> 01:06:08,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It wasn't just you, but everybody.

982
01:06:08,955 --> 01:06:14,718
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you did something, and then we all gathered around, and we were like, yeah, do it, do it, do it, you stupid kid, do it.

983
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,279
[SPEAKER_06]: And he ran off into the bathroom, and you know he was crying.

984
01:06:18,120 --> 01:06:28,745
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, like, when we were playing Pot of Potta, those people who were getting back there, and the one that knocked me in the shoulder, you know, doing fake whatever, I had, like, seven people kicked out of the arcade that night.

985
01:06:29,758 --> 01:06:30,318
[SPEAKER_14]: Wow.

986
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:38,861
[SPEAKER_17]: I used to be, until I stopped, because I stopped going right after that, I used to have people kicked out of the arcade every time I was there because I wouldn't stand for it.

987
01:06:39,341 --> 01:06:47,484
[SPEAKER_17]: I would not stand to go into an arcade and see people acting like complete stupid idiots when the whole purpose of going to an arcade is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.

988
01:06:47,524 --> 01:06:47,804
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah.

989
01:06:48,644 --> 01:06:48,985
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

990
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:50,185
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

991
01:06:50,760 --> 01:06:54,343
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, what we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break because we've been sitting here for a while dishing on In The Groove.

992
01:06:54,363 --> 01:06:59,287
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to come back and we're going to talk about now what Konami's up to because everything has just hit the fan this week.

993
01:06:59,587 --> 01:07:08,334
[SPEAKER_06]: It was seriously like you could see the tumbleweed flying across, you know, the Bomani scene has been dead and now just seriously, like over the weekend, bam, it all hit.

994
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:11,556
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to talk about what now Konami's up to right after this break.

995
01:07:11,936 --> 01:07:17,521
[SPEAKER_06]: In this break, since we've been talking a little bit about In The Groove, I figured I'd humor the In The Groove fans with some music from In The Groove.

996
01:07:17,561 --> 01:07:20,403
[SPEAKER_06]: And in case you haven't actually played the game, you can hear what some of the music sounds like.

997
01:07:20,663 --> 01:07:25,145
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're going to start it off with some Nina with Fly With Me, and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio after this.

998
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:00,360
Thank you for watching!

999
01:08:38,992 --> 01:08:44,238
The Bright in the Sky Finding your way to my home Come play with me

1000
01:09:12,204 --> 01:09:12,986
[SPEAKER_14]: and many more.

1001
01:10:12,782 --> 01:10:29,348
[SPEAKER_18]: Don't promise me a world that you can't figure out Don't promise me freedom Don't promise me a bridge

1002
01:10:30,948 --> 01:10:44,663
[SPEAKER_18]: That you can't cross alone Don't promise me a life That you cannot turn on Don't promise me

1003
01:11:00,234 --> 01:11:01,114
Thanks for watching!

1004
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:44,560
[SPEAKER_19]: I've got MC confusion, I'm front a lot

1005
01:12:08,780 --> 01:12:09,561
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

1006
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,122
[SPEAKER_19]: Thank you for watching!

1007
01:12:54,071 --> 01:12:54,651
[SPEAKER_19]: on the mic.

1008
01:12:54,832 --> 01:12:56,793
[SPEAKER_19]: Must be, yo, isn't Wendy Ron so tight?

1009
01:12:56,893 --> 01:12:58,894
[SPEAKER_19]: You're having difficulty dredging out your brain.

1010
01:12:58,914 --> 01:13:00,835
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact of which MC was that?

1011
01:13:00,855 --> 01:13:01,996
[SPEAKER_19]: Which MC was that?

1012
01:13:02,036 --> 01:13:03,077
[SPEAKER_19]: I can't recollect.

1013
01:13:03,157 --> 01:13:07,259
[SPEAKER_19]: I heard him on the internet and it was MC Front or something but I didn't hit save.

1014
01:13:07,299 --> 01:13:08,520
[SPEAKER_19]: Which MC was that?

1015
01:13:08,580 --> 01:13:09,241
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't say.

1016
01:13:10,662 --> 01:13:11,322
[SPEAKER_19]: I couldn't say.

1017
01:13:13,516 --> 01:13:31,136
[SPEAKER_19]: StepUp, Poindex, The Axe Model, then you're all about to pull the MC name out the jar And whoever gets closest wins an iron-sided die and a gift certificate to prize, yo The moniker is MC Front a lot, I got a plus one bag, an earth core hip hop And my mail list busted, hundreds on famous, it's unbelievable nobody know what my name is

1018
01:13:39,128 --> 01:13:41,269
We are the damage of the sun

1019
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:20,772
[SPEAKER_14]: We are the landings for the sun We roll like hammocks from the sun We are the landings from the sun

1020
01:15:10,231 --> 01:15:11,732
[SPEAKER_14]: We are the lemmings on the run.

1021
01:15:46,192 --> 01:15:51,996
[SPEAKER_25]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio, because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1022
01:16:08,044 --> 01:16:17,086
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, now, Konami's kind of been trying to keep secrets about what they're going to be doing at... Oh, never mind, I thought you guys were talking to me.

1023
01:16:19,847 --> 01:16:22,428
[SPEAKER_06]: They've been trying to keep quiet about some of the things they're going to be doing at E3.

1024
01:16:22,948 --> 01:16:24,128
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they like to surprise us.

1025
01:16:24,228 --> 01:16:30,810
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in Konami's list... If they were trying to be quiet about it, why did they give it to GamePro?

1026
01:16:31,010 --> 01:16:32,991
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me get there for a minute, damn you.

1027
01:16:33,531 --> 01:16:33,851
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1028
01:16:35,094 --> 01:16:43,499
[SPEAKER_06]: So, usually, you know, they don't announce their stuff until it's getting closer to E3 time and, you know, they save most of their stuff for the show.

1029
01:16:43,939 --> 01:16:45,580
[SPEAKER_06]: But this year, some of the stuff's gotten out early.

1030
01:16:47,321 --> 01:16:47,581
[SPEAKER_06]: What's that?

1031
01:16:47,721 --> 01:16:53,324
[SPEAKER_06]: IGN already blew the lid on the DDR with Mario is definitely going to be showing up.

1032
01:16:53,444 --> 01:16:54,985
[SPEAKER_05]: And Karaoke Revolution 4.

1033
01:16:55,285 --> 01:16:56,866
[SPEAKER_06]: And they also blew the lid on Karaoke Revolution 4.

1034
01:16:57,666 --> 01:17:03,916
[SPEAKER_06]: and now what happened this week is that GamePro magazine, their website... Remember last year?

1035
01:17:03,956 --> 01:17:04,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I know.

1036
01:17:04,537 --> 01:17:05,378
[SPEAKER_06]: That happened last year too.

1037
01:17:05,398 --> 01:17:05,759
[SPEAKER_06]: Shame, shame.

1038
01:17:05,779 --> 01:17:08,563
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, they spoiled all the unlocks on DDR Extreme last year.

1039
01:17:09,004 --> 01:17:12,089
[SPEAKER_06]: And now what they did this year is they actually blew the lid on...

1040
01:17:13,206 --> 01:17:14,207
[SPEAKER_06]: Some big things going on.

1041
01:17:14,267 --> 01:17:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: They actually have Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2.

1042
01:17:17,828 --> 01:17:25,532
[SPEAKER_06]: And some very observant observers over on DDRFreak.com actually found these while they were surfing through GamePro's site.

1043
01:17:25,552 --> 01:17:30,054
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first one that we have details leaked on was Ultramix 3.

1044
01:17:31,035 --> 01:17:34,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Now again, I think most people assumed both these games were going to be coming.

1045
01:17:35,097 --> 01:17:35,658
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for watching!

1046
01:17:52,959 --> 01:17:56,121
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think Ultramix 3 especially are very curious to see what's going to happen with that.

1047
01:17:56,621 --> 01:18:09,987
[SPEAKER_06]: So on the GamePro article, basically it reveals that there will be over 100 minutes of energetic dance music, and it's going to have over 65 songs, and I'm assuming that the downloads will still be accessible as well.

1048
01:18:10,847 --> 01:18:20,712
[SPEAKER_06]: In fact, it does say it's compatible with all previous download song packs from DDR and DDR Ultramix 2, so that's 60 more songs right there, so that's 125 songs if you already have all these packs.

1049
01:18:21,332 --> 01:18:21,873
[SPEAKER_06]: from the start.

1050
01:18:22,213 --> 01:18:24,855
[SPEAKER_06]: Here are some of the new modes they're going to have in DDR Ultimix 3.

1051
01:18:25,015 --> 01:18:26,096
[SPEAKER_06]: Freestyle mode.

1052
01:18:26,637 --> 01:18:34,042
[SPEAKER_06]: And that will allow you to dance just the way you want to to any song in the game while rewarding you for doing different combinations.

1053
01:18:34,463 --> 01:18:35,564
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like a freestyle mode.

1054
01:18:35,604 --> 01:18:44,411
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that just means you get to dance with no arrows, but maybe, I don't know if it's like a recording mode or it's rewarding you for doing certain things.

1055
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:50,716
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I think that's the impression I'm getting from it is that if you do certain step combos during it, you get rewarded.

1056
01:18:52,003 --> 01:18:52,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting, huh?

1057
01:18:53,104 --> 01:18:53,764
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no idea.

1058
01:18:53,804 --> 01:18:57,427
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't really tell from the names alone, but that's pretty much all the article gives us right there.

1059
01:18:57,947 --> 01:19:00,309
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there was that.

1060
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:01,810
[SPEAKER_06]: And, let's see.

1061
01:19:03,811 --> 01:19:05,452
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, there's going to have quest mode.

1062
01:19:06,053 --> 01:19:09,975
[SPEAKER_06]: Quest mode is basically, it's like a story mode now for DDR.

1063
01:19:10,015 --> 01:19:12,517
[SPEAKER_06]: So, DDR is now getting... Yes, Toadie?

1064
01:19:13,598 --> 01:19:14,258
[SPEAKER_06]: No, continue.

1065
01:19:14,859 --> 01:19:16,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Quest mode, basically now... Yes?

1066
01:19:17,501 --> 01:19:19,362
[SPEAKER_17]: Didn't they do this with Dance, Dance, Dance?

1067
01:19:19,382 --> 01:19:19,442
Yes.

1068
01:19:20,053 --> 01:19:22,394
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but how many people in this area know what that is?

1069
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:25,375
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, seriously, how many people in the scene know what Dance Dance Dance is, even?

1070
01:19:25,676 --> 01:19:26,896
[SPEAKER_17]: It was a really crappy game.

1071
01:19:27,056 --> 01:19:28,577
[SPEAKER_06]: But now it's getting this quest mode.

1072
01:19:28,877 --> 01:19:36,961
[SPEAKER_06]: You can travel virtually from city to city and build the ultimate dance team by completing challenging songs and routines along the way.

1073
01:19:37,541 --> 01:19:40,962
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's basically a quest mode for DDR, like a story mode.

1074
01:19:41,242 --> 01:19:42,303
[SPEAKER_17]: It's Pokemon DDR!

1075
01:19:42,363 --> 01:19:44,664
[SPEAKER_06]: It's You Got Served the game.

1076
01:19:46,945 --> 01:19:47,485
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.

1077
01:19:48,145 --> 01:19:49,186
[SPEAKER_07]: That makes me sad.

1078
01:19:49,795 --> 01:19:50,656
[SPEAKER_07]: You know what, though?

1079
01:19:51,858 --> 01:19:53,019
[SPEAKER_07]: It's cute, I guess.

1080
01:19:53,220 --> 01:19:54,421
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's cute.

1081
01:19:55,042 --> 01:19:56,404
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jaded, though, but...

1082
01:19:57,267 --> 01:19:58,347
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1083
01:20:21,034 --> 01:20:24,756
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a whole library of dancing characters out there that haven't really been on the Xbox yet.

1084
01:20:24,796 --> 01:20:32,181
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm thinking maybe putting two and two together, that's probably what Story Mode is going to encompass is more of those characters.

1085
01:20:32,201 --> 01:20:33,862
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping more original characters.

1086
01:20:33,882 --> 01:20:42,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm really, really hoping, because this is Konami of Hawaii, we will finally see the DDR PC characters cross over onto console.

1087
01:20:42,807 --> 01:20:43,568
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's right.

1088
01:20:44,268 --> 01:20:48,791
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to travel to San Francisco in Quest Mode and meet Betty and Mr. Spanky.

1089
01:20:51,624 --> 01:20:52,265
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1090
01:21:08,462 --> 01:21:09,403
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1091
01:21:30,359 --> 01:21:32,861
[SPEAKER_06]: Jukebox Mode is another mode that's going to be in this game.

1092
01:21:33,281 --> 01:21:41,826
[SPEAKER_06]: Jukebox Mode, this is a quote from the article, Jukebox Mode turns your Xbox into a music machine, allowing players to enjoy more than 65 tracks from the game.

1093
01:21:42,947 --> 01:21:43,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1094
01:21:43,787 --> 01:21:57,296
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of sounds like a throwaway mode, but, well, you know, with DDR having the full screen videos and everything, maybe there will be more full screen videos in Ultramix, because there's only been like one video in each game.

1095
01:21:57,336 --> 01:21:59,257
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to do that thing, which was...

1096
01:22:00,029 --> 01:22:02,331
[SPEAKER_06]: Really, really homoerotic, by the way.

1097
01:22:02,932 --> 01:22:05,515
[SPEAKER_06]: And then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja and Ultramix 2.

1098
01:22:06,956 --> 01:22:08,738
[SPEAKER_06]: So hopefully there'll be more actual videos.

1099
01:22:08,798 --> 01:22:11,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Even if not, think about it, 2DX6 style had a mode like this.

1100
01:22:12,662 --> 01:22:15,465
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was well-received, so maybe there'll be something like that.

1101
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:17,349
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll see.

1102
01:22:17,709 --> 01:22:34,393
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course there will be workout mode and of course edit mode and we're just going to assume here and assume that it still has the be able to upload your own steps because it does say you can't upload content so we are assuming that to mean that you get to do your own steps again as well as online tournaments and Xbox Live Play.

1103
01:22:36,154 --> 01:22:38,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So any thoughts on Ultramix 3?

1104
01:22:38,894 --> 01:22:43,055
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that Ultramix 3 needs that Ultramix 2 and 1 didn't have?

1105
01:22:43,616 --> 01:22:45,036
[SPEAKER_17]: It needs a Pocari Sweat Dispenser.

1106
01:22:45,979 --> 01:22:47,160
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on, realistically.

1107
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:48,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe in story mode you might see it.

1108
01:22:53,445 --> 01:23:03,012
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, it's hard to think of new and innovative things to do with DDR in general.

1109
01:23:04,633 --> 01:23:06,214
[SPEAKER_17]: Except they need freaking dance magic.

1110
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:14,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I want a first-person shooter minigame in this because every game should have a first-person shooter aspect to it.

1111
01:23:14,451 --> 01:23:18,739
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, maybe in quest mode there'll be a, you know... I'm going to throw arrows at you.

1112
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:20,923
[SPEAKER_17]: Konami should take a cue from Namco.

1113
01:23:21,553 --> 01:23:24,594
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, your loading screens, you can play little, you know, old Konami games.

1114
01:23:24,634 --> 01:23:25,455
[SPEAKER_06]: You could play Gradius.

1115
01:23:25,855 --> 01:23:29,757
[SPEAKER_17]: I was freaking playing the hell out of Starblade on the Tekken 5.

1116
01:23:29,917 --> 01:23:32,578
[SPEAKER_07]: You could totally do Pac-Man or something on that pad.

1117
01:23:32,918 --> 01:23:35,880
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, um... But that's more midway.

1118
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:38,841
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultramix had some real shitloading times, too, in the very beginning.

1119
01:23:38,881 --> 01:23:40,022
[SPEAKER_06]: It takes forever for the game to boot.

1120
01:23:40,242 --> 01:23:44,604
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know if it's because you go through, like, five copyright screens before you finally get to the actual game.

1121
01:23:45,184 --> 01:23:50,249
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not all copyrighted, but you get one copyrighted screen, one screen that says Bomani, one screen that says all this garbage.

1122
01:23:50,409 --> 01:23:56,975
[SPEAKER_17]: Like Yaya Kung Fu and Super Konami World and Castlevania.

1123
01:23:58,976 --> 01:24:07,704
[SPEAKER_06]: Here's my thing, though, with Ultramix 3 is that I really, really, really hope they keep up their relationship with a different drummer.

1124
01:24:08,484 --> 01:24:36,922
[SPEAKER_06]: and I've been saying this every place I possibly can because I really want to see this happen because I think the different drum music that we had in Ultramix 2 was seriously like the best thing to happen to DDR since DDR I don't know it was the best so I really hope they are going to continue that relationship with a different drum or at least even if not that label specifically that whole idea of finding independent musicians who make just as damn good music as anybody else and put it in the game to make big honestly

1125
01:24:37,854 --> 01:24:41,998
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, honestly, I just forgot what I was going to say.

1126
01:24:42,799 --> 01:24:43,179
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay.

1127
01:24:44,140 --> 01:24:54,771
[SPEAKER_17]: I was sort of just, it's trying to wrap my mind around a whole, I guess, RPG mode in a DDR game.

1128
01:24:55,983 --> 01:24:58,906
[SPEAKER_17]: I still have flashbacks to Dance Dance Dance, and that game was horrible.

1129
01:25:11,164 --> 01:25:12,385
[SPEAKER_06]: This is going to suck.

1130
01:25:13,005 --> 01:25:17,187
[SPEAKER_06]: And now I believe Ultramix 2 is the best home release we've had on any system, period.

1131
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:21,790
[SPEAKER_06]: And it kind of stank at E3 last year.

1132
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:25,792
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's going to be interesting to see exactly how much we get to see this year at E3.

1133
01:25:25,832 --> 01:25:27,073
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

1134
01:25:27,253 --> 01:25:27,573
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1135
01:25:27,973 --> 01:25:38,900
[SPEAKER_06]: and also, you know, another good thing that Ultramix has been pretty good on is providing us with new, like, 10s for those folks that like the challenge and just, you know, and I'm looking at you, Toadie, the people that just can't enjoy DDR without there being 10-footers in it.

1136
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:45,104
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's not that I can't enjoy it, it's the fact that you'll come out with some new song and you'll make it a 7-footer.

1137
01:25:45,464 --> 01:25:51,568
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, during, I was with Loki when we were testing out DDR Extreme US and I think it was...

1138
01:25:53,382 --> 01:25:59,561
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think I AAA'd like half of the new songs on the first try with the bigger timing windows and I'm like, okay, now what?

1139
01:26:00,637 --> 01:26:01,878
[SPEAKER_07]: What am I going to do with this?

1140
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:05,521
[SPEAKER_07]: Add a challenge difficulty or something.

1141
01:26:05,541 --> 01:26:07,783
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you have four difficulties to work with.

1142
01:26:07,983 --> 01:26:11,506
[SPEAKER_07]: You can make one of those difficult to suit everybody.

1143
01:26:11,806 --> 01:26:20,032
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to remember, though, Tony, on the bell of players that these games are made to, you could imagine it on a graph that looks like an upside-down U, a bell curve.

1144
01:26:20,392 --> 01:26:22,954
[SPEAKER_06]: You are way on the bottom over here.

1145
01:26:23,014 --> 01:26:25,296
[SPEAKER_06]: You are one of the few that they need to cater to.

1146
01:26:26,137 --> 01:26:28,078
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make a challenge difficulty.

1147
01:26:28,699 --> 01:26:28,999
[SPEAKER_07]: It's

1148
01:26:29,488 --> 01:26:31,449
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll design the damn steps myself.

1149
01:26:31,469 --> 01:26:32,029
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, come on.

1150
01:26:32,069 --> 01:26:34,750
[SPEAKER_07]: There's more than enough people that would be willing to do it.

1151
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:35,551
[SPEAKER_07]: You know?

1152
01:26:35,651 --> 01:26:37,531
[SPEAKER_07]: You have four difficulties or whatever.

1153
01:26:37,591 --> 01:26:40,072
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make one hard one.

1154
01:26:40,473 --> 01:26:40,873
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1155
01:26:40,913 --> 01:26:41,273
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1156
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:44,074
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, so we will see what happens with quest mode a little later on.

1157
01:26:44,134 --> 01:26:47,335
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, as we get more details, we'll post it to our website, orangelaundry.com.

1158
01:26:47,856 --> 01:26:48,996
[SPEAKER_06]: DDR Freak as well.

1159
01:26:49,156 --> 01:26:51,237
[SPEAKER_06]: They've got lots and lots of news on this stuff.

1160
01:26:51,317 --> 01:26:54,218
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the other sites out there, I'm sure, are reporting on this as well.

1161
01:26:54,538 --> 01:26:56,999
[SPEAKER_06]: Speaking of DDR Freak, I want to mention this at some point during the show.

1162
01:26:57,340 --> 01:26:57,900
[SPEAKER_06]: Friday nights...

1163
01:26:58,540 --> 01:27:01,121
[SPEAKER_06]: on DDR Freak Radio are actually replays of this show.

1164
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:05,602
[SPEAKER_06]: So to those of you guys who are actually hearing this the first time on Friday Night DDR Freak, hello, and thanks for listening.

1165
01:27:06,662 --> 01:27:10,063
[SPEAKER_06]: So check that out over on The Freak, as we so lovingly call it here on this show.

1166
01:27:12,164 --> 01:27:15,085
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else on Ultramix you guys want to add in?

1167
01:27:15,245 --> 01:27:15,465
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1168
01:27:16,505 --> 01:27:19,906
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to talk about Extreme 2, but first we're going to have ourselves a little bit of a cage match.

1169
01:27:19,926 --> 01:27:21,127
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got to get to that at some point tonight.

1170
01:27:21,347 --> 01:27:23,087
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you believe how fast this show is going by tonight?

1171
01:27:23,627 --> 01:27:25,528
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what happens when you actually have news to talk about.

1172
01:27:27,112 --> 01:27:30,053
[SPEAKER_06]: Midnight Tune 2 or something like that.

1173
01:27:54,500 --> 01:27:58,924
[SPEAKER_05]: It's some arcade racing game, and it was Nothing Lives Forever.

1174
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:04,508
[SPEAKER_05]: Starring Paul O'Terry, and it was a guy that did the music from Act Raiders.

1175
01:28:05,129 --> 01:28:05,930
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, sounds good.

1176
01:28:07,192 --> 01:28:10,396
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we're going to play a clip from this one because it was last week's winner.

1177
01:28:10,416 --> 01:28:12,899
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it's going to go up against two brand new songs.

1178
01:28:13,279 --> 01:28:15,482

1182
01:28:24,813 --> 01:28:26,794
[SPEAKER_06]: This one's been sitting here for a long time.

1183
01:29:57,196 --> 01:29:59,703
Thank you for watching!

1184
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,907
I am the reacher What you need?

1185
01:31:23,221 --> 01:31:25,623
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, that was a clip there of song number one.

1186
01:31:25,663 --> 01:31:28,424
[SPEAKER_06]: That was Politary, Nothing Lives Forever.

1187
01:31:28,985 --> 01:31:31,326
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, song number two is my song tonight.

1188
01:31:32,147 --> 01:31:38,371
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, lately I've been kind of downloading these random British trance and dance compilations.

1189
01:31:38,411 --> 01:31:40,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just like, I just want more dance music.

1190
01:31:40,272 --> 01:31:40,952
[SPEAKER_06]: Gimme, gimme, gimme.

1191
01:31:41,713 --> 01:31:44,454
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I found this one and I kind of like this one.

1192
01:31:44,514 --> 01:31:46,496
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a little bit poppy, but...

1193
01:31:47,336 --> 01:31:54,244
[SPEAKER_06]: I just like it, so I'm putting it in the cage match, because I think you guys will like it too, and I think this is like total DDR songs, so we'll see.

1194
01:31:54,364 --> 01:32:00,450
[SPEAKER_06]: This artist is named Diamond, somebody I've never heard of, but this is the artist Diamond, and the song is Reason.

1195
01:32:00,530 --> 01:32:01,031
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy, you guys.

1196
01:32:21,056 --> 01:32:41,438
[SPEAKER_14]: Something in the air, I don't know why You were hardly there when I was on my own There's something about you that makes me cry

1197
01:34:17,560 --> 01:34:18,822
[SPEAKER_14]: Thanks for watching!

1198
01:35:28,754 --> 01:35:32,435
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, boys and girls, that was song number two tonight, Diamond with Reason.

1199
01:35:32,495 --> 01:35:36,616
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and see what everybody thought, if they had a reason to love it or a reason to despise it.

1200
01:35:37,016 --> 01:35:37,576
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

1201
01:35:39,217 --> 01:35:42,717
[SPEAKER_17]: I hate to say it was pretty generic, not too exciting.

1202
01:35:43,778 --> 01:35:50,719
[SPEAKER_17]: It was good, it was solid, but generic, so it gets a five and a half.

1203
01:35:51,462 --> 01:35:51,942
[SPEAKER_05]: Five and a half.

1204
01:35:52,563 --> 01:35:52,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki.

1205
01:35:53,644 --> 01:35:54,164
[SPEAKER_05]: It was okay.

1206
01:35:54,624 --> 01:36:09,135
[SPEAKER_05]: It reminded me of the bass line, it reminded me of something from Run Lola Run, but then it sounded like some other song I heard of, and so it's, I don't know, it's just kind of, it's not bad, it just sounds familiar.

1207
01:36:10,176 --> 01:36:12,738
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, so I give it a seven.

1208
01:36:13,206 --> 01:36:19,890
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I give the porn on my PSP a 10 Which you were putting on cam during that song Yes I did You know what I think the familiarity is?

1209
01:36:19,930 --> 01:36:22,011
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody pointed this out in the chatroom Who said this?

1210
01:36:22,051 --> 01:36:41,643
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I totally agree with what they said I apologize to who said this because I can't Oh, Fireboma said It has a very Lasco feeling to it Oh no, Zaku said it first Legend of Zaku said it has a very Lasco sound to it I kind of agree It sounds like them Which is interesting because Lasco actually had a song on this exact same CD But it sounded like totally unlike them So go figure

1211
01:36:42,383 --> 01:36:43,183
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I like it.

1212
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,884
[SPEAKER_06]: It's poppy.

1213
01:36:44,104 --> 01:36:47,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think somebody said they could sing along to it.

1214
01:36:47,105 --> 01:36:47,865
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel the same way.

1215
01:36:48,105 --> 01:36:50,626
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a drive in my car and sing and feel happy and pretty.

1216
01:36:51,347 --> 01:36:51,847
[SPEAKER_06]: So I give it an 8.

1217
01:36:53,447 --> 01:36:53,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Toadie.

1218
01:36:56,348 --> 01:36:58,889
[SPEAKER_07]: I was in the bathroom and I missed about half the song.

1219
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:01,130
[SPEAKER_07]: It sounded pretty generic to me.

1220
01:37:01,150 --> 01:37:04,632
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I said, I only caught the last third of it or so.

1221
01:37:05,612 --> 01:37:08,493
[SPEAKER_07]: But... I don't know.

1222
01:37:08,533 --> 01:37:10,854
[SPEAKER_07]: It didn't strike me as anything particularly...

1223
01:37:12,074 --> 01:37:12,755
[SPEAKER_07]: Outstanding.

1224
01:37:12,795 --> 01:37:13,696
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll give it a six.

1225
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:14,917
[SPEAKER_12]: Alrighty.

1226
01:37:15,098 --> 01:37:19,803
[SPEAKER_12]: But... I was in the kitchen and it sounded like standard pop.

1227
01:37:20,925 --> 01:37:22,406
[SPEAKER_12]: And, yeah, nothing terribly exciting.

1228
01:37:22,486 --> 01:37:22,767
[SPEAKER_12]: Six.

1229
01:37:24,128 --> 01:37:26,591
[SPEAKER_12]: It's definitely driving the car, singing along, be gay, all that.

1230
01:37:26,611 --> 01:37:27,692
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, thanks.

1231
01:37:28,634 --> 01:37:29,435
[SPEAKER_06]: I do that too, just...

1232
01:37:30,100 --> 01:37:30,640
[SPEAKER_06]: You be gay?

1233
01:37:30,941 --> 01:37:31,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1234
01:37:31,902 --> 01:37:32,582
[SPEAKER_06]: Gayest and happy.

1235
01:37:33,002 --> 01:37:33,543
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, exactly.

1236
01:37:33,623 --> 01:37:34,043
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, alright.

1237
01:37:34,764 --> 01:37:36,786
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, let's move on.

1238
01:37:36,986 --> 01:37:39,208
[SPEAKER_06]: There is one more song you guys get to vote for tonight.

1239
01:37:39,248 --> 01:37:39,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Here it is.

1240
01:37:39,768 --> 01:37:40,749
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Jamie's pick.

1241
01:37:40,769 --> 01:37:42,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Jamie, what did you pick for us tonight?

1242
01:37:42,810 --> 01:37:46,393
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sure people have heard this on my Tuesday show, Plug Plug.

1243
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:54,260
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is a song off of the CD called Demo Crazy, which was by Damon Auburn of Blur, also the guy behind Gorillaz.

1244
01:37:55,034 --> 01:37:56,034
[SPEAKER_17]: Big surprise, huh?

1245
01:37:56,875 --> 01:38:00,696
[SPEAKER_17]: But this is a remix of a song off of that album called A Rappy Song.

1246
01:38:01,197 --> 01:38:02,137
[SPEAKER_17]: It's really out there.

1247
01:38:02,317 --> 01:38:04,598
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the title alone makes me think of PSO.

1248
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:05,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I just a nerd?

1249
01:38:05,398 --> 01:38:05,939
[SPEAKER_17]: All rappies?

1250
01:38:06,419 --> 01:38:09,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I just a nerd because I think of rag rappies?

1251
01:38:09,500 --> 01:38:12,321
[SPEAKER_17]: Well, the thing is... Keep in mind, I haven't heard the song yet.

1252
01:38:12,421 --> 01:38:13,342
[SPEAKER_17]: How's this for nerdy?

1253
01:38:13,862 --> 01:38:16,823
[SPEAKER_06]: There actually is... Oh, your mic just went off.

1254
01:38:17,748 --> 01:38:18,028
[SPEAKER_17]: Hello?

1255
01:38:18,088 --> 01:38:18,449
[SPEAKER_06]: There you are.

1256
01:38:18,969 --> 01:38:24,534
[SPEAKER_17]: There is an item called an Alrapi that you could use to boost your stats and the developers were using it for game testing.

1257
01:38:24,955 --> 01:38:25,095
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh.

1258
01:38:25,435 --> 01:38:26,636
[SPEAKER_17]: And I've got some.

1259
01:38:27,857 --> 01:38:28,157
[SPEAKER_06]: Cheater.

1260
01:38:28,418 --> 01:38:30,099
[SPEAKER_17]: I cheated PSO and I'm proud of it.

1261
01:38:30,420 --> 01:38:31,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, here we go.

1262
01:38:31,260 --> 01:38:34,924
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number three tonight, Damon Albrin with A Rapi Song, the remix.

1263
01:38:34,964 --> 01:38:35,184
[SPEAKER_06]: Enjoy.

1264
01:38:54,649 --> 01:38:56,090
Thank you for watching!

1265
01:39:58,458 --> 01:40:06,022
[SPEAKER_10]: I can't believe you have to stay behind me, go beyond and talk to me baby, tell me why, so now your people can try to follow me, programming your fear to die.

1266
01:40:41,676 --> 01:40:42,597
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

1267
01:41:55,458 --> 01:41:59,941
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number three, Damon Albren with a Rappi song, the remix.

1268
01:42:00,341 --> 01:42:02,222
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you think it was Rappi or Crappi?

1269
01:42:02,642 --> 01:42:03,323
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura.

1270
01:42:04,543 --> 01:42:07,385
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm just really pissed off at the people who are being fucking rude about all of these songs.

1271
01:42:08,306 --> 01:42:12,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm giving it... Don't let them ruffle your feathers.

1272
01:42:12,288 --> 01:42:15,530
[SPEAKER_17]: No, the thing is that I see this week after week, and this is bullshit.

1273
01:42:16,050 --> 01:42:19,772
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, we are doing this show for you people, and the least you can do is be nice, okay?

1274
01:42:20,373 --> 01:42:23,755
[SPEAKER_17]: So I give the chat room a negative 50, and I give my song a 10.

1275
01:42:24,634 --> 01:42:25,655
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Loki.

1276
01:42:26,336 --> 01:42:27,417
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't care for this song.

1277
01:42:28,719 --> 01:42:29,139
[SPEAKER_05]: Not at all.

1278
01:42:30,842 --> 01:42:31,382
[SPEAKER_05]: Gets a four.

1279
01:42:33,805 --> 01:42:35,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought it was kind of quirky.

1280
01:42:36,328 --> 01:42:38,370
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, it had a nice groove to it, though.

1281
01:42:38,411 --> 01:42:43,817
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say I didn't like it, because I thought it was kind of groovy and it made me bounce, so that's worth something, so I give it a seven.

1282
01:42:44,277 --> 01:42:44,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Toadie.

1283
01:42:45,782 --> 01:42:46,823
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I got to agree with that.

1284
01:42:46,843 --> 01:42:51,606
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it was pretty damn weird, but I noticed I was sitting there, like, you know, bouncing, you know, my head to it.

1285
01:42:52,526 --> 01:42:54,267
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's quirky.

1286
01:42:54,448 --> 01:42:56,549
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it was something I think I could listen to.

1287
01:42:56,589 --> 01:42:57,009
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd give it an 8.

1288
01:42:57,309 --> 01:42:57,990
[SPEAKER_07]: I liked that one.

1289
01:42:58,410 --> 01:42:58,730
[SPEAKER_07]: Alrighty.

1290
01:42:59,111 --> 01:42:59,351
[SPEAKER_07]: Bug!

1291
01:43:02,453 --> 01:43:02,873
[SPEAKER_12]: I'd give it a 7.

1292
01:43:03,133 --> 01:43:05,455
[SPEAKER_12]: It was definitely something you can bop along to.

1293
01:43:06,135 --> 01:43:06,435
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright.

1294
01:43:07,196 --> 01:43:07,556
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright!

1295
01:43:08,058 --> 01:43:12,279
[SPEAKER_06]: That being said, let's recap the three songs you can vote for tonight in tonight's cage match.

1296
01:43:12,319 --> 01:43:17,980
[SPEAKER_06]: Song number one you can vote for is Politary with No One Lives Forever, I think.

1297
01:43:18,920 --> 01:43:19,240
[SPEAKER_14]: Yes!

1298
01:43:19,580 --> 01:43:20,200
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.

1299
01:43:23,221 --> 01:43:23,741
[SPEAKER_06]: Where's my clip?

1300
01:43:23,761 --> 01:43:24,601
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.

1301
01:43:32,362 --> 01:43:36,443
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, and song number two you can vote for tonight is Diamond with Reason.

1302
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:51,673
[SPEAKER_06]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Damon Albren with a rappy song.

1303
01:43:52,214 --> 01:43:54,676
Alright guys, place vote now.

1304
01:43:54,716 --> 01:43:57,037
[SPEAKER_10]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

1305
01:43:57,057 --> 01:44:00,140
[SPEAKER_10]: Song number one, song number two, or song number three.

1306
01:44:14,602 --> 01:44:19,464
[SPEAKER_06]: Hurry, hurry, hurry, get your votes in now, because we don't leave the window open very long, so send those in.

1307
01:44:20,324 --> 01:44:23,745
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're not sure how to do that, ask somebody in chat, they will help you out, because they're nice.

1308
01:44:24,445 --> 01:44:27,987
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, this is the part of the show where I usually ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene.

1309
01:44:28,027 --> 01:44:29,507
[SPEAKER_06]: So, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

1310
01:44:29,787 --> 01:44:31,648
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as I'm aware, nothing.

1311
01:44:32,608 --> 01:44:36,190
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm double-checking to make sure, you know, that that's not the case.

1312
01:44:37,170 --> 01:44:38,871
[SPEAKER_05]: I would hope that there's something going on.

1313
01:44:41,551 --> 01:44:42,072
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

1314
01:44:44,710 --> 01:45:06,054
[SPEAKER_05]: No, really, um, I don't think there is anything going on as far as, um, releases go, because I was checking the other day for, um, some brand new, you know, the food mix stuff, see if there's any, um, you know, new stuff for that, but, um, no, no, there, there wasn't, so, but like I said, I'm double checking right now.

1315
01:45:07,014 --> 01:45:07,915
[SPEAKER_05]: I should have done this earlier.

1316
01:45:09,495 --> 01:45:13,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, whatever, you know, honestly, it doesn't matter.

1317
01:45:14,416 --> 01:45:14,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Um,

1318
01:45:16,127 --> 01:45:18,469
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyways, let's see here.

1319
01:45:20,551 --> 01:45:23,533
[SPEAKER_05]: You might check out DDRUK since they're still coming about.

1320
01:45:23,853 --> 01:45:30,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure they're working on still the... What was it?

1321
01:45:33,881 --> 01:45:36,083
[SPEAKER_05]: The brand new SimFiles 4, I think.

1322
01:45:36,263 --> 01:45:39,305
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they're finishing up Ultramix 2 or something.

1323
01:45:39,346 --> 01:45:41,287
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the song packs for Ultramix 2.

1324
01:45:42,048 --> 01:45:43,048
[SPEAKER_05]: Last time I checked.

1325
01:45:43,409 --> 01:45:43,509
[SPEAKER_05]: Um...

1326
01:45:45,606 --> 01:45:52,748
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, other than that, you're not going to find much new stuff out there because there really isn't that much new stuff coming around.

1327
01:45:52,888 --> 01:45:57,849
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm seeing if there's any developments in the food mix thing here.

1328
01:45:58,209 --> 01:45:58,629
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish.

1329
01:45:58,969 --> 01:46:00,409
[SPEAKER_05]: Food mix 2 needs to come out.

1330
01:46:01,209 --> 01:46:03,210
[SPEAKER_05]: Needs to come out now.

1331
01:46:03,290 --> 01:46:04,970
[SPEAKER_06]: Are they actually doing a food mix 2?

1332
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:05,590
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.

1333
01:46:05,910 --> 01:46:06,570
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, hot.

1334
01:46:08,371 --> 01:46:09,911
[SPEAKER_05]: I reported that a while ago.

1335
01:46:10,631 --> 01:46:11,251
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but anyways.

1336
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,852
[SPEAKER_05]: I forgot.

1337
01:46:12,952 --> 01:46:13,612
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, kill me.

1338
01:46:14,992 --> 01:46:16,572
[SPEAKER_05]: No, here's what's going on.

1339
01:46:16,913 --> 01:46:22,254
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like DDRCNC style selection from Beat Mario.

1340
01:46:24,294 --> 01:46:27,435
[SPEAKER_05]: Their webpage is updated, whatever that's supposed to mean.

1341
01:46:28,576 --> 01:46:29,036
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

1342
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:30,556
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't say anything.

1343
01:46:30,716 --> 01:46:31,836
[SPEAKER_05]: So guess what, folks?

1344
01:46:31,916 --> 01:46:33,297
[SPEAKER_05]: That means nothing's going on.

1345
01:46:33,697 --> 01:46:34,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Nada.

1346
01:46:34,497 --> 01:46:37,678
[SPEAKER_05]: Just some more shitty sim files, Bavani style.

1347
01:46:39,195 --> 01:46:40,755
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, you can't blame it on myself.

1348
01:46:40,955 --> 01:46:44,836
[SPEAKER_05]: How many Max remixes posted in the last day?

1349
01:46:45,296 --> 01:46:46,797
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's find out, shall we?

1350
01:46:47,737 --> 01:46:54,718
[SPEAKER_05]: No, honestly, um... I haven't seen that many Max remixes lately.

1351
01:46:54,738 --> 01:46:57,079
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually haven't seen any Max remixes lately.

1352
01:46:57,099 --> 01:47:04,480
[SPEAKER_05]: I think they may be just not even trying to make them with any structure whatsoever.

1353
01:47:04,580 --> 01:47:07,121
[SPEAKER_05]: The ones I've seen have been like these stupid boss files.

1354
01:47:08,389 --> 01:47:16,893
[SPEAKER_05]: and those are really crappy, but just for shits and giggles, let's see how many Max remixes there are since the last time we broadcast.

1355
01:47:17,473 --> 01:47:18,033
[SPEAKER_17]: I vote 20.

1356
01:47:19,614 --> 01:47:19,854
[SPEAKER_05]: You think 20?

1357
01:47:20,034 --> 01:47:20,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

1358
01:47:23,856 --> 01:47:25,317
[SPEAKER_05]: And the winner is...

1359
01:47:27,472 --> 01:47:31,956
[SPEAKER_05]: Starion Survivor Max Starion Survivor Max

1360
01:47:55,862 --> 01:48:02,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Starion, Survivor, Rizla, Max, Deep, Dynamite, Max Attack, Trip Machine, Climax, Max Period,

1361
01:48:09,349 --> 01:48:22,056
[SPEAKER_05]: Max420, LOL, DJ, OB, VI, DJ Vicious, eat your heart out, some joke file, and Max Unlimited, edit, and then Max Wipeout version 2.

1362
01:48:23,857 --> 01:48:25,818
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, folks, none of this stuff's worth downloading.

1363
01:48:26,518 --> 01:48:28,019
[SPEAKER_05]: Just save your time.

1364
01:48:29,180 --> 01:48:30,801
[SPEAKER_06]: Do something more constructive like download porn.

1365
01:48:31,021 --> 01:48:31,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously.

1366
01:48:31,781 --> 01:48:36,784
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, there's a lot more porn out there than sim files, and you know what?

1367
01:48:36,824 --> 01:48:38,805
[SPEAKER_05]: With porn, you can never get bad porn, so that's

1368
01:48:39,431 --> 01:48:40,092
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good to know.

1369
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:41,794
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

1370
01:48:42,715 --> 01:48:43,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything else?

1371
01:48:44,297 --> 01:48:49,243
[SPEAKER_05]: I say, you know, make porn, not, you know, bad Maxim files.

1372
01:48:49,403 --> 01:48:52,286
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what... Actually, no, I don't want to see anyone making porn.

1373
01:48:52,667 --> 01:48:54,028
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't make your own porn.

1374
01:48:54,228 --> 01:48:54,669
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't, don't.

1375
01:48:55,029 --> 01:48:56,631
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially considering most of you are under 18.

1376
01:48:56,731 --> 01:48:57,672
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't do that!

1377
01:48:58,113 --> 01:48:59,394
[SPEAKER_06]: That would be illegal.

1378
01:48:59,515 --> 01:48:59,795
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1379
01:49:00,137 --> 01:49:02,199
[SPEAKER_06]: We are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, guys.

1380
01:49:02,259 --> 01:49:04,601
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to start talking about Xtreme 2 a little bit, though.

1381
01:49:04,621 --> 01:49:07,544
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you do want to get in on the Skype line, let me tell you this.

1382
01:49:07,945 --> 01:49:10,767
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that tons of people want to get in tonight.

1383
01:49:10,948 --> 01:49:12,009
[SPEAKER_06]: So be ready.

1384
01:49:12,669 --> 01:49:13,830
[SPEAKER_06]: www.

1385
01:49:13,910 --> 01:49:17,654
[SPEAKER_06]: I've actually got emails of people that want to get in, like, or wanting me to open it up special for them.

1386
01:49:17,714 --> 01:49:19,436
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're going to have to go against them.

1387
01:49:19,676 --> 01:49:21,498
[SPEAKER_06]: www.OrangeLoungeRadio.com.

1388
01:49:21,578 --> 01:49:23,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Click on Interact With Us and get your program ready.

1389
01:49:25,640 --> 01:49:28,341
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, I want to talk about Extreme 2 real quick.

1390
01:49:28,421 --> 01:49:36,863
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, the person that found DDR Ultramix 3 was this person, Tep, over on DDR Freak.

1391
01:49:37,363 --> 01:49:51,567
[SPEAKER_06]: And then after Tep found out about the Ultramix 3, one of the admins over there, Cutris, actually went over and started kind of, I guess, scouring GamePro's site a little bit and found out that GamePro also spilled the beans on Extreme 2!

1392
01:49:52,387 --> 01:49:52,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops.

1393
01:49:54,082 --> 01:50:06,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Oops, they did it again, and I say that for a reason, because one of the big shockers in this article is that Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 will have Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again as confirmed songs.

1394
01:50:10,613 --> 01:50:16,177
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I know this thrills DarkSakura to no end here, considering how she feels about that type of music.

1395
01:50:16,197 --> 01:50:17,198
[SPEAKER_06]: Isn't that Jenny in a Bottle?

1396
01:50:17,918 --> 01:50:18,959
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not Jenny in a Bottle.

1397
01:50:18,979 --> 01:50:20,440
[SPEAKER_17]: How about Shit in a Bag?

1398
01:50:22,401 --> 01:50:23,242
[SPEAKER_17]: Set that on fire.

1399
01:50:25,969 --> 01:50:29,570
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, so that was one big revolution, or revolution, revelation made.

1400
01:50:30,570 --> 01:50:33,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Again, they're saying over 100 minutes of dance music going to be in there.

1401
01:50:34,312 --> 01:50:47,216
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're saying, this is what GamePro is saying now, keep in mind that I believe it was them or somebody said this last year and it didn't really happen, but they are saying PlayStation 2 owners will be able to go head-to-head with a new online feature.

1402
01:50:47,717 --> 01:50:48,737
[SPEAKER_06]: So the online thing,

1403
01:50:50,469 --> 01:50:57,152
[SPEAKER_06]: The Online Thing doing so well in Ultramix 2 that now it's going to be a part of Extreme 2 as well.

1404
01:50:57,672 --> 01:50:58,732
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting, I think.

1405
01:51:01,193 --> 01:51:03,654
[SPEAKER_06]: As if you didn't know enough stupid people on Xbox Live.

1406
01:51:03,734 --> 01:51:07,296
[SPEAKER_06]: Now you get to meet them on PlayStation 2, which opens up a whole new world of stupid people.

1407
01:51:09,147 --> 01:51:23,400
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's about it, although we do know that iToySupport is coming back, and as well... Yeah, iToySupport's coming back, and let's see... Workout mode is coming as well, and you get to do your own steps in edit mode, of course, as well.

1408
01:51:23,861 --> 01:51:24,902
[SPEAKER_06]: So, that's about it.

1409
01:51:24,942 --> 01:51:30,387
[SPEAKER_06]: The online mode being the biggest thing about that, as well as the Genie in a Bottle and Oops, I Did It Again.

1410
01:51:30,807 --> 01:51:31,028
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

1411
01:51:32,429 --> 01:51:34,090
[SPEAKER_06]: This goes back to what I said earlier.

1412
01:51:34,110 --> 01:51:35,531
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember I said I'd mention this again.

1413
01:51:35,952 --> 01:51:38,674
[SPEAKER_06]: Remember, boys and girls, DDR Extreme is not made for you.

1414
01:51:38,914 --> 01:51:42,597
[SPEAKER_06]: It's made partially for you, and you'll get something out of it.

1415
01:51:42,617 --> 01:51:44,158
[SPEAKER_06]: You'll get your Sakura, I'm sure.

1416
01:51:44,559 --> 01:51:48,301
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know anything for sure, but I think it's a given that Sakura will probably show up in this one.

1417
01:51:49,002 --> 01:51:52,845
[SPEAKER_06]: But now, for the Slumber Party girls, they're going to have genie in a bottle and oops, I did it again.

1418
01:51:52,985 --> 01:51:53,205
[SPEAKER_07]: Deal.

1419
01:51:53,646 --> 01:52:01,692
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also have to remember that none of these girls usually, I shouldn't say none, a very small percentage of these nine-year-old Slumber Party girls are going to play on heavy, but...

1420
01:52:02,247 --> 01:52:07,352
[SPEAKER_07]: Konami is going to give them 7 foot steps with 200 steps on heavy anyway.

1421
01:52:07,832 --> 01:52:11,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Wouldn't it be comedy gold though if they made Genie in a Bottle like a 10 footer?

1422
01:52:11,276 --> 01:52:13,017
[SPEAKER_06]: I would actually probably buy the game.

1423
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:16,461
[SPEAKER_06]: Just as a joke.

1424
01:52:18,177 --> 01:52:19,578
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is interesting.

1425
01:52:19,618 --> 01:52:21,938
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's online, then people can create their own steps.

1426
01:52:21,958 --> 01:52:25,260
[SPEAKER_06]: So you know there's going to be 10-foot steps out there to oops, I did it again, but they'll be crap.

1427
01:52:25,580 --> 01:52:30,421
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be like finger-finger revolution stuff where it's like, oops, I did it again.

1428
01:52:30,701 --> 01:52:33,182
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's make no sense.

1429
01:52:33,402 --> 01:52:38,344
[SPEAKER_06]: Just a big string of 16th notes that go in random, no sensical order whatsoever.

1430
01:52:38,884 --> 01:52:40,525
[SPEAKER_06]: Much like many in the groove 12-footers.

1431
01:52:41,705 --> 01:52:44,426
[SPEAKER_07]: Or they'll just go in and add triplets, which don't go to anything.

1432
01:52:46,167 --> 01:52:46,347
[SPEAKER_07]: So...

1433
01:52:48,396 --> 01:52:49,116
[SPEAKER_06]: Very interesting.

1434
01:52:50,817 --> 01:52:52,198
[SPEAKER_06]: It was actually EGM.

1435
01:52:52,718 --> 01:52:53,579
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the tip there.

1436
01:52:53,939 --> 01:52:58,041
[SPEAKER_06]: EGM was actually the one that said that online play would be included last year, and they were wrong.

1437
01:52:58,301 --> 01:52:59,582
[SPEAKER_06]: But now GamePro is saying it this year.

1438
01:53:00,182 --> 01:53:03,144
[SPEAKER_06]: And hopefully, I don't know.

1439
01:53:03,164 --> 01:53:04,845
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you think online play is a good thing for DDR?

1440
01:53:04,865 --> 01:53:05,465
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's a bad thing.

1441
01:53:07,246 --> 01:53:09,068
[SPEAKER_07]: Are you asking me that specifically?

1442
01:53:09,808 --> 01:53:11,089
[SPEAKER_07]: Or are you asking the chat room?

1443
01:53:12,209 --> 01:53:14,171
[SPEAKER_06]: I guess anybody in the room that wants to answer that.

1444
01:53:14,711 --> 01:53:16,672
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do the Skype line thing later for those who want to ask.

1445
01:53:17,273 --> 01:53:24,557
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's pretty much impossible for them to tell who's using a controller and who's using a pad.

1446
01:53:24,617 --> 01:53:31,661
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's really not worth my time to try and put forth a bunch of... Well, now Xbox Live will tell you who's using a controller.

1447
01:53:31,721 --> 01:53:36,243
[SPEAKER_07]: I was actually under the impression that they had some sort of system that allowed them to bypass that.

1448
01:53:37,424 --> 01:53:40,065
[SPEAKER_06]: I think everybody will hack anything.

1449
01:53:40,085 --> 01:53:40,165
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1450
01:53:40,589 --> 01:53:41,570
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

1451
01:54:03,306 --> 01:54:05,288
[SPEAKER_06]: For 99% of players, it's not going to matter.

1452
01:54:05,388 --> 01:54:08,370
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean, I guess for the people that can't get out to an arcade, it's great.

1453
01:54:08,410 --> 01:54:09,891
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, for me, I would never use it.

1454
01:54:09,931 --> 01:54:13,073
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd just rather go to my local arcade or whatever and play people.

1455
01:54:13,274 --> 01:54:26,103
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is interesting because this kind of ties into what you were talking about in the last show, Loki, is you were talking about this is where DDR is going, is that because the arcades are dying and nobody seems to care anymore, online mode is where it's going to.

1456
01:54:26,203 --> 01:54:28,004
[SPEAKER_06]: So does this news surprise you at all, Loki?

1457
01:54:28,045 --> 01:54:28,605
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm kind of curious.

1458
01:54:29,265 --> 01:54:29,966
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but...

1459
01:54:30,185 --> 01:54:33,207
[SPEAKER_05]: Then again, they need more things to be on their network adapter.

1460
01:54:33,868 --> 01:54:35,889
[SPEAKER_05]: After all, they don't want to be like the GameCube.

1461
01:54:37,751 --> 01:54:38,551
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, now, who knows?

1462
01:54:38,591 --> 01:54:43,535
[SPEAKER_06]: There might be some big thing that comes down with DDR with Mario, which is the one game we didn't get a new news on this week.

1463
01:54:44,496 --> 01:54:45,817
[SPEAKER_06]: Very soon, though.

1464
01:54:45,917 --> 01:54:46,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Think about it, guys.

1465
01:54:46,597 --> 01:54:47,938
[SPEAKER_06]: We're only a week and a half away.

1466
01:54:47,958 --> 01:54:53,102
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, folks, do you really think you're going to get online play with anything on the GameCube?

1467
01:54:53,322 --> 01:54:53,562
[SPEAKER_05]: No.

1468
01:54:53,903 --> 01:54:55,204
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll get LAN play.

1469
01:54:55,744 --> 01:54:56,805
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, LAN play.

1470
01:54:58,346 --> 01:54:58,926
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy me.

1471
01:54:59,127 --> 01:54:59,727
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, maybe.

1472
01:55:00,652 --> 01:55:02,892
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I wouldn't expect to get online play of DDR with Mario.

1473
01:55:02,913 --> 01:55:05,633
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be very weird because DDR with Mario.

1474
01:55:05,673 --> 01:55:07,193
[SPEAKER_05]: Stupid kids don't know how to use the internet.

1475
01:55:07,213 --> 01:55:08,234
[SPEAKER_05]: What the hell are we talking about?

1476
01:55:10,394 --> 01:55:10,714
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright.

1477
01:55:10,994 --> 01:55:11,434
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly.

1478
01:55:12,355 --> 01:55:13,095
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn Mario.

1479
01:55:13,235 --> 01:55:15,515
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking A. Why doesn't he plumb something?

1480
01:55:15,535 --> 01:55:23,757
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, honestly, he's been doing a lot of, like, macking on princesses and, like, smashing turtles, but I haven't actually seen him, you know, unclog a toilet.

1481
01:55:25,488 --> 01:55:27,090
[SPEAKER_12]: He just unclogs the princess all the time.

1482
01:55:27,710 --> 01:55:31,454
[SPEAKER_17]: No, they unclog the pipes of all of those monsters in Mario Brothers.

1483
01:55:31,534 --> 01:55:32,375
[SPEAKER_05]: He cleans her pipes.

1484
01:55:32,395 --> 01:55:33,336
[SPEAKER_05]: He cleans her pipes.

1485
01:55:35,538 --> 01:55:37,359
[SPEAKER_05]: Waxes.

1486
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,440
[SPEAKER_05]: With his plunger.

1487
01:55:39,802 --> 01:55:40,082
[SPEAKER_05]: God.

1488
01:55:41,308 --> 01:55:42,469
[SPEAKER_06]: We've sunk that low.

1489
01:55:42,589 --> 01:55:43,110
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, we have.

1490
01:55:43,770 --> 01:55:47,713
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, I think that's a sign that we probably should reveal the cage match winner.

1491
01:55:47,733 --> 01:55:49,454
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys ready to hear about the cage match winner tonight?

1492
01:55:49,774 --> 01:55:50,174
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1493
01:55:50,215 --> 01:55:50,575
[SPEAKER_16]: Why not?

1494
01:55:50,955 --> 01:55:53,897
[SPEAKER_06]: Tons of people voted in tonight's cage match.

1495
01:55:53,957 --> 01:55:56,239
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this is one of the largest turnouts we've had in a while.

1496
01:55:56,659 --> 01:56:00,442
[SPEAKER_06]: And the winning song won by only two votes, if you can believe that.

1497
01:56:00,742 --> 01:56:01,702
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to hear the song that won?

1498
01:56:03,283 --> 01:56:03,804
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1499
01:56:05,605 --> 01:56:07,707
[SPEAKER_06]: Damon Aldrin with a crappy song.

1500
01:56:07,807 --> 01:56:08,267
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, shit!

1501
01:56:10,100 --> 01:56:12,022
[SPEAKER_17]: No, I'm really fucking surprised.

1502
01:56:12,802 --> 01:56:13,182
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1503
01:56:13,263 --> 01:56:21,349
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what happened, because the other songs had the exact same number of votes, I think the trance vote got split and it allowed the quirk thing to go through.

1504
01:56:21,689 --> 01:56:27,634
[SPEAKER_06]: Either that or after you spanked everybody in the chat room, they voted for you out of fear.

1505
01:56:28,034 --> 01:56:32,177
[SPEAKER_17]: No, seriously, all I wanted was for people just to be a little bit more open.

1506
01:56:32,277 --> 01:56:33,398
[SPEAKER_17]: And it wasn't just for me.

1507
01:56:33,438 --> 01:56:35,760
[SPEAKER_17]: They were bitching about everything that went through.

1508
01:56:35,780 --> 01:56:37,462
[SPEAKER_17]: So I was like, stop bitching.

1509
01:56:37,522 --> 01:56:38,342
[SPEAKER_17]: Just listen.

1510
01:56:38,763 --> 01:56:39,063
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1511
01:56:40,219 --> 01:56:41,860
[SPEAKER_06]: People will bitch about everything.

1512
01:56:41,920 --> 01:56:42,800
[SPEAKER_17]: So the internet's for us.

1513
01:56:42,820 --> 01:56:43,260
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1514
01:56:43,881 --> 01:56:45,702
[SPEAKER_06]: As an internet celebrity, you're going to have to deal with this.

1515
01:56:47,082 --> 01:56:47,502
[SPEAKER_17]: I know.

1516
01:56:48,323 --> 01:56:52,005
[SPEAKER_06]: There's going to be paparazzi out there that are going to photograph you when you're feeling fat.

1517
01:56:52,025 --> 01:56:58,468
[SPEAKER_17]: But like any celebrity, I have to throw a temper tantrum every so often so they can be on the cover of the star.

1518
01:56:58,508 --> 01:56:58,868
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1519
01:56:59,428 --> 01:57:02,970
[SPEAKER_17]: And then I can sue them for money for something.

1520
01:57:03,010 --> 01:57:03,770
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what we need?

1521
01:57:03,850 --> 01:57:06,151
[SPEAKER_06]: We need like an internet version of the star.

1522
01:57:07,012 --> 01:57:07,932
[SPEAKER_06]: And we should be in it.

1523
01:57:08,692 --> 01:57:10,593
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be a flattering story.

1524
01:57:10,813 --> 01:57:12,514
[SPEAKER_06]: No fat pictures of me.

1525
01:57:13,275 --> 01:57:14,695
[SPEAKER_06]: Nude sunbathing or anything like that.

1526
01:57:16,016 --> 01:57:18,798
[SPEAKER_05]: How about we make a website called fakenews.com?

1527
01:57:19,078 --> 01:57:20,379
[SPEAKER_06]: They probably already have it.

1528
01:57:20,419 --> 01:57:21,439
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why we're not going to make it.

1529
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:23,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, let me check.

1530
01:57:23,200 --> 01:57:25,722
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, moviepoopshoot.com is still around.

1531
01:57:25,742 --> 01:57:26,242
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh my god.

1532
01:57:28,775 --> 01:57:36,462
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, it's your show, boys and girls, and I always fear this part of the show when I let it be their show.

1533
01:57:36,522 --> 01:57:36,742
[SPEAKER_05]: Ha!

1534
01:57:37,062 --> 01:57:38,984
[SPEAKER_06]: There is no fakenews.com.

1535
01:57:39,224 --> 01:57:40,765
[SPEAKER_06]: We will make it happen.

1536
01:57:41,226 --> 01:57:42,567
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody's going to get to it before you.

1537
01:57:42,647 --> 01:57:42,987
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see.

1538
01:57:44,471 --> 01:57:45,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway guys, we're going to go to a break.

1539
01:57:45,653 --> 01:57:49,478
[SPEAKER_06]: When we come back, it's your show because we are going to open up the Skype line right after this.

1540
01:57:49,958 --> 01:57:56,527
[SPEAKER_06]: In this break though, you get music from, I figure since we've done a lot of home stuff tonight, we're going to do Ultramix 2 in this break.

1541
01:57:56,627 --> 01:57:59,711
[SPEAKER_06]: So enjoy this selection of music from Ultramix 2 and we'll be back after this.

1542
01:58:16,553 --> 01:58:31,353
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't wanna be the one to tell you how I feel When these feelings I have really are for real The time is right for this, a love to shine on through But you gotta tell me what you wanna do

1557
02:06:12,549 --> 02:06:15,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Good, I think we have a little bit of a delay, so start talking.

1558
02:06:15,793 --> 02:06:16,454
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1559
02:06:19,898 --> 02:06:27,607
[SPEAKER_23]: Well, basically, now that we've got the news on Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3, I'm starting to get pretty pumped for this year's E3.

1560
02:06:29,071 --> 02:06:31,232
[SPEAKER_06]: I am absolutely pumped for this year's E3.

1561
02:06:31,272 --> 02:06:48,263
[SPEAKER_06]: When you consider that we have Extreme 2 and we have Ultramix 3 and we have DDR with Mario and we have Karaoke Revolution 4 and we have God knows whatever Red Octane's going to show and whatever Korean crap shows up in Kenshiya Hall, this is going to be a beautiful E3 for us music gamers.

1562
02:06:48,283 --> 02:06:48,824
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm very happy.

1563
02:06:51,826 --> 02:06:55,488
[SPEAKER_23]: This is going to be the best year for music games period.

1564
02:06:56,429 --> 02:06:58,430
[SPEAKER_23]: And I do have something to say for all the

1565
02:06:59,557 --> 02:07:01,578
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, what would you like to say?

1566
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:25,733
[SPEAKER_23]: I was going to say anything, what I wanted to say to all the naysayers, to all the people who decided to come out and bitch right out of the gate as soon as the announcements were made, shut up, you don't know what's going to be on these games outside of Genie and Oops, and that's two songs out of a possible 65 plus song mix, shut up.

1567
02:07:28,081 --> 02:07:32,482
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree, I agree, those people just need to sit down and shut up until we have more information on the game.

1568
02:07:32,842 --> 02:07:38,004
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to know why no company wants to release information on games before E3?

1569
02:07:38,364 --> 02:07:53,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's because this is what people do with, you know, any game that has a loyal fan base, is that people start just tearing the shit apart, and they dream up this own list in their head of everything they want, or the game's gonna suck, and then, you know, they're disappointed because the developers have a different vision.

1570
02:07:54,049 --> 02:07:55,149
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you want to know why

1571
02:07:55,889 --> 02:07:58,932
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody keeps it in their pants until E3.

1572
02:07:58,972 --> 02:07:59,513
[SPEAKER_06]: This is why.

1573
02:07:59,853 --> 02:08:00,714
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a perfect example.

1574
02:08:00,994 --> 02:08:04,738
[SPEAKER_08]: Go look at the thread and everybody bitching.

1575
02:08:08,521 --> 02:08:08,922
[SPEAKER_06]: Any thoughts?

1576
02:08:09,843 --> 02:08:15,168
[SPEAKER_20]: Why can't it be like arcades that have all my favorite songs on them?

1577
02:08:15,588 --> 02:08:18,290
[SPEAKER_20]: Where's my Max Period from the other home version?

1578
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:21,231
[SPEAKER_04]: God, some people piss me off.

1579
02:08:21,411 --> 02:08:23,471
[SPEAKER_04]: This game better have Sakura.

1580
02:08:23,631 --> 02:08:26,232
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not buying this game unless Sakura is in it.

1581
02:08:27,553 --> 02:08:28,433
[SPEAKER_06]: Jesus, people.

1582
02:08:28,533 --> 02:08:33,174
[SPEAKER_06]: Sakura is like the most horrid song in DDR Extreme.

1583
02:08:33,995 --> 02:08:36,555
[SPEAKER_06]: I will not buy this game unless Sakura is not in it.

1584
02:08:36,735 --> 02:08:36,976
[SPEAKER_06]: Ha!

1585
02:08:38,256 --> 02:08:38,836
[SPEAKER_17]: Got you.

1586
02:08:40,417 --> 02:08:41,657
[SPEAKER_17]: Sakura makes everything cool.

1587
02:08:44,444 --> 02:08:48,807
[SPEAKER_23]: I want as much licensed mainstream crap as humanly possible.

1588
02:08:50,008 --> 02:09:00,254
[SPEAKER_23]: I want to see people so pissed off at this year's song list that steam is coming out of their ears while I sit back, copy of Extreme 2, laughing my ass off.

1589
02:09:00,615 --> 02:09:00,915
[SPEAKER_06]: That's right.

1590
02:09:00,955 --> 02:09:04,177
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what kind of... Let's dream for a minute here.

1591
02:09:04,257 --> 02:09:08,340
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's think about if I were to make DDR Extreme 2.

1592
02:09:09,100 --> 02:09:10,061
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's think for a minute here.

1593
02:09:10,641 --> 02:09:11,782
[SPEAKER_06]: What types of songs...

1594
02:09:12,879 --> 02:09:16,703
[SPEAKER_06]: What I want to put in Extreme 2, let me think, I'm going to make my mix here for a minute here.

1595
02:09:18,425 --> 02:09:23,650
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see, so I would definitely have Oops I Did It Again, and Genie in a Bottle would definitely have to be in this.

1596
02:09:24,491 --> 02:09:29,156
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was trying to queue up some musical stuff, but my thing is frozen.

1597
02:09:29,176 --> 02:09:30,498
[SPEAKER_06]: There we go, there we go, thank you.

1598
02:09:31,018 --> 02:09:31,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's see.

1599
02:09:31,659 --> 02:09:34,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-oh, did the feed drop?

1600
02:09:37,351 --> 02:09:38,772
[SPEAKER_23]: I think we're still here.

1601
02:09:39,152 --> 02:09:39,853
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm still with you.

1602
02:09:39,873 --> 02:09:41,634
[SPEAKER_05]: There may be a delay, but I'm still with you.

1603
02:09:41,795 --> 02:09:44,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we had a spot of downtime there, but we're back.

1604
02:09:45,338 --> 02:09:45,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Who cares?

1605
02:09:45,818 --> 02:09:47,540
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just, like, rambling.

1606
02:09:49,722 --> 02:09:54,406
[SPEAKER_05]: The internet declined your request of making a custom DVR mix.

1607
02:09:55,427 --> 02:09:55,947
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry, Rob.

1608
02:09:56,308 --> 02:09:57,048
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I guess so.

1609
02:09:57,128 --> 02:09:58,810
[SPEAKER_06]: The internet just didn't want that to happen.

1610
02:09:59,030 --> 02:09:59,370
[SPEAKER_06]: My bad.

1611
02:09:59,410 --> 02:10:00,812
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh, this must not happen!

1612
02:10:01,711 --> 02:10:05,284
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it was live 365 because we never disconnected.

1613
02:10:09,704 --> 02:10:10,725
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not sure what happened there, guys.

1614
02:10:10,765 --> 02:10:12,826
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, let's just keep rolling here because the archives are going.

1615
02:10:13,947 --> 02:10:20,511
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess if you want to hear what happened during the chaos moment there, just listen to the DDR Freak archive because it'll all be there.

1616
02:10:21,452 --> 02:10:24,493
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, I think if any of you guys are on the net, I need you to stop what you're doing.

1617
02:10:24,654 --> 02:10:26,155
[SPEAKER_06]: Stop your uploads and stop whatever you're doing.

1618
02:10:26,215 --> 02:10:27,535
[SPEAKER_06]: Close any programs that are connected to the internet.

1619
02:10:27,575 --> 02:10:29,537
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, man, so much for my six-bit torrent.

1620
02:10:29,577 --> 02:10:30,517
[SPEAKER_06]: We need all the bandwidth right now.

1621
02:10:31,418 --> 02:10:31,638
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it?

1622
02:10:31,838 --> 02:10:32,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, all right.

1623
02:10:33,459 --> 02:10:34,340
[SPEAKER_17]: We never disconnected.

1624
02:10:34,580 --> 02:10:35,300
[SPEAKER_17]: It's live 365.

1625
02:10:35,340 --> 02:10:36,221
[SPEAKER_17]: They've done this to me, too.

1626
02:10:36,401 --> 02:10:36,661
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1627
02:10:36,881 --> 02:10:38,082
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the goddamn government.

1628
02:10:38,122 --> 02:10:39,163
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hacksering us.

1629
02:10:41,576 --> 02:10:45,217
[SPEAKER_06]: I am showing the stations up on the air and streaming, so it's just going to take them a minute to get in.

1630
02:10:45,397 --> 02:10:47,437
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god, they shut off the monitor!

1631
02:10:47,577 --> 02:10:48,417
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do this.

1632
02:10:48,557 --> 02:10:48,917
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go.

1633
02:10:49,057 --> 02:10:50,978
[SPEAKER_06]: Mullet, why don't I give you a call right back?

1634
02:10:51,158 --> 02:10:52,298
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to go to a music break, okay?

1635
02:10:54,218 --> 02:10:54,818
[SPEAKER_06]: Mullet, are you still there?

1636
02:10:55,658 --> 02:10:56,579
[SPEAKER_20]: They killed Mullet!

1637
02:10:56,819 --> 02:10:57,659
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh my god!

1638
02:10:58,099 --> 02:10:59,919
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, we're going to go to a music break and come right back, okay?

1639
02:10:59,979 --> 02:11:00,779
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm not dead!

1640
02:11:01,539 --> 02:11:02,280
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll call you back.

1641
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:07,180
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we're going to go to a music break real quick here.

1642
02:11:07,280 --> 02:11:10,741
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys are with us, we are going to go to a break here while everything is...

1643
02:11:11,129 --> 02:11:13,591
[SPEAKER_04]: being burned and destroyed and it's awful.

1644
02:11:13,751 --> 02:11:15,332
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my god, the choppers.

1645
02:11:15,452 --> 02:11:19,555
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh no, the government guys with their cell phones are going to signal us to death.

1646
02:11:20,576 --> 02:11:21,717
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I have a very... DP reference.

1647
02:11:21,737 --> 02:11:21,877
[SPEAKER_06]: Cancer!

1648
02:11:24,110 --> 02:11:30,355
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a very appropriate song for this break, too, and it's actually topical, so people reconnecting during this downtime will find this to be hilarious.

1649
02:11:30,395 --> 02:11:37,601
[SPEAKER_05]: See, perhaps, though, they were just thinking that, you know, ET wanted the phone home, so they were just providing him with the walkie-talkie that he could do that with.

1650
02:11:38,081 --> 02:11:40,763
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just trying to be helpful instead of hurtful.

1651
02:11:41,564 --> 02:11:43,405
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's take a minute out and come back, okay?

1652
02:11:44,046 --> 02:11:44,566
[SPEAKER_05]: Ah, fine.

1653
02:12:28,690 --> 02:12:50,738
[SPEAKER_14]: I think I did it again I made you believe We're more than just friends Oh baby

1654
02:13:08,045 --> 02:13:10,897
I played with your heart Got lost in this game Oh baby

1655
02:14:00,976 --> 02:14:01,838
Thanks for watching!

1656
02:14:47,597 --> 02:14:50,600
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we are back here on Orange Launch Radio, and an appropriate choice there.

1657
02:14:50,660 --> 02:14:54,284
[SPEAKER_06]: We played the fifth mix version of Oops, I Did It Again during our little downtime there.

1658
02:14:55,085 --> 02:14:55,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry about that.

1659
02:14:55,986 --> 02:14:56,807
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what happened.

1660
02:14:56,887 --> 02:15:08,659
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a combination of Live 365 did a net fart, and then I was trying to launch iTunes because I was going to do a gag because Elmullet and I were talking about songs that we would like to see on DDR Extreme 2.

1661
02:15:08,859 --> 02:15:10,521
[SPEAKER_06]: Surprise, an Apple product crashing.

1662
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:17,755
[SPEAKER_06]: So actually, what I'm going to do now, I know a lot of you guys are actually calling in, but I do want to give Elmullet a proper chance to say goodbye.

1663
02:15:17,775 --> 02:15:18,795
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're calling him right back.

1664
02:15:18,835 --> 02:15:19,696
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, Elmullet, you there?

1665
02:15:21,557 --> 02:15:22,258
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm here, Sky.

1666
02:15:22,298 --> 02:15:22,758
[SPEAKER_06]: How's it going?

1667
02:15:22,858 --> 02:15:23,099
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

1668
02:15:23,159 --> 02:15:24,960
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we still have a little bit of that delay, but that's okay.

1669
02:15:24,980 --> 02:15:26,441
[SPEAKER_05]: Elmullet, live from the Middle East.

1670
02:15:28,162 --> 02:15:29,764
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't know what happened there.

1671
02:15:30,024 --> 02:15:36,368
[SPEAKER_06]: But actually, I have to say, the best comment, one of the best comments I've ever seen in our chat room came during that break.

1672
02:15:36,849 --> 02:15:40,652
[SPEAKER_06]: And somebody said, who has a dark tetsuya, said, it's the rapture.

1673
02:15:44,139 --> 02:15:47,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Like we'd be the ones disappearing during the rapture.

1674
02:15:48,080 --> 02:15:49,420
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, anyway, so El Mullet.

1675
02:15:51,080 --> 02:15:58,001
[SPEAKER_06]: In my dream fantasy extreme, too, I was going to get to, I was going to do audio clips, but iTunes decided to kill my computer.

1676
02:15:58,942 --> 02:16:05,863
[SPEAKER_06]: We have, I would have, oops, I did it again, Genie in a Bottle, My Prerogative, the New My New My A song has to be in there for sure.

1677
02:16:06,523 --> 02:16:09,263
[SPEAKER_06]: Venga Boys, We Like to Party, definitely would be in there as well.

1678
02:16:09,603 --> 02:16:10,864
[SPEAKER_06]: Alice DJ, Better Off Alone.

1679
02:16:11,804 --> 02:16:12,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Madonna...

1680
02:16:13,484 --> 02:16:16,106
[SPEAKER_06]: Old School Madonna and New School Madonna would definitely have to be in it.

1681
02:16:16,607 --> 02:16:18,188
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see, what else would be in there?

1682
02:16:18,388 --> 02:16:20,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody told me, because you know that.

1683
02:16:20,169 --> 02:16:23,391
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend and all that stuff.

1684
02:16:24,052 --> 02:16:28,475
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we would definitely have to have all of the American Idols as well.

1685
02:16:28,575 --> 02:16:29,576
[SPEAKER_17]: Oh my God, we need Clay.

1686
02:16:30,116 --> 02:16:30,556
[SPEAKER_17]: And Clay.

1687
02:16:30,576 --> 02:16:31,257
[SPEAKER_17]: Because he's hot.

1688
02:16:32,357 --> 02:16:33,058
[SPEAKER_06]: Clay is hot.

1689
02:16:33,078 --> 02:16:33,979
[SPEAKER_17]: If I was invisible.

1690
02:16:34,299 --> 02:16:34,499
[SPEAKER_06]: Step.

1691
02:16:35,143 --> 02:16:35,763
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, it'd be great.

1692
02:16:35,803 --> 02:16:40,244
[SPEAKER_06]: And they'd all have ten-footers, and so, you know, it'd be invisible.

1693
02:16:40,484 --> 02:16:40,724
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway.

1694
02:16:41,065 --> 02:16:41,705
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll tell you this.

1695
02:16:41,765 --> 02:16:46,966
[SPEAKER_23]: If I'm interrupting, there would be fifth mix.

1696
02:16:47,466 --> 02:16:50,967
[SPEAKER_23]: It would all be fifth mix plus random add-ons.

1697
02:16:52,608 --> 02:16:53,448
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea.

1698
02:16:53,468 --> 02:16:53,928
[SPEAKER_06]: It would be glorious.

1699
02:16:54,188 --> 02:16:54,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I like the idea of DDR2.

1700
02:16:54,948 --> 02:16:58,609
[SPEAKER_23]: I would be the only one who would buy the copy because, well, let's face it.

1701
02:17:01,870 --> 02:17:02,050
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah.

1702
02:17:02,810 --> 02:17:03,351
[SPEAKER_06]: Go lag.

1703
02:17:03,631 --> 02:17:05,913
[SPEAKER_06]: I know, we have horrible, horrible lag tonight.

1704
02:17:06,293 --> 02:17:07,534
[SPEAKER_06]: So, oh well.

1705
02:17:07,594 --> 02:17:10,037
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I agree with the idea that Fifth Mix would rock.

1706
02:17:11,118 --> 02:17:12,299
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's just pour Fifth Mix in.

1707
02:17:12,359 --> 02:17:14,240
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's try to get all the original versions of song, too.

1708
02:17:14,300 --> 02:17:16,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get the original, like, tribal dance and all that stuff.

1709
02:17:16,122 --> 02:17:16,522
[SPEAKER_06]: That'd be great.

1710
02:17:17,443 --> 02:17:19,065
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have to have the new My New My A song in there.

1711
02:17:19,085 --> 02:17:19,325
[SPEAKER_06]: Come on.

1712
02:17:20,496 --> 02:17:23,638
[SPEAKER_23]: I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go.

1713
02:17:23,678 --> 02:17:24,719
[SPEAKER_23]: This delay is horrible.

1714
02:17:24,799 --> 02:17:25,579
[SPEAKER_23]: I'll try this again.

1715
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:26,019
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1716
02:17:26,039 --> 02:17:26,820
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Mollet.

1717
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,680
[SPEAKER_23]: Very, very sorry.

1718
02:17:27,700 --> 02:17:28,060
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all right.

1719
02:17:28,080 --> 02:17:28,681
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Mollet.

1720
02:17:28,881 --> 02:17:30,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Take care, and I'll plug it for him.

1721
02:17:30,582 --> 02:17:34,184
[SPEAKER_06]: InsidePulse.com is super duper, so visit it.

1722
02:17:34,564 --> 02:17:36,145
[SPEAKER_05]: I know what song needs to be in there.

1723
02:17:36,225 --> 02:17:36,425
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

1724
02:17:37,786 --> 02:17:38,607
[SPEAKER_05]: The Muppet one.

1725
02:17:39,187 --> 02:17:39,447
[SPEAKER_05]: Manamana.

1726
02:17:39,567 --> 02:17:40,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Manamana.

1727
02:17:45,339 --> 02:17:46,600
[SPEAKER_06]: That's in a commercial now.

1728
02:17:47,060 --> 02:17:50,703
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, we are taking calls on our Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.

[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio, who's this?

1731
02:17:57,948 --> 02:17:58,709
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku.

1732
02:17:58,989 --> 02:18:00,590
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, Legend of Zaku, what's on your mind, buddy?

1733
02:18:01,731 --> 02:18:04,212
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just got a few things I managed to find.

1734
02:18:04,493 --> 02:18:08,515
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, I'm just trying to perpetuate the rumor cycle a little bit.

1735
02:18:08,916 --> 02:18:09,836
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, Christ, what's up?

1736
02:18:09,856 --> 02:18:10,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope you have a link right now.

1737
02:18:11,792 --> 02:18:14,394
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm posting up a link right now from a person's live journal.

1738
02:18:14,414 --> 02:18:18,437
[SPEAKER_01]: Apparently, this is going to sound strange, but just bear with me.

1739
02:18:19,318 --> 02:18:29,066
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems that this guy who's posting on his live journal basically, you know, heard some information a while back, and I mean like about maybe two or three years ago.

1740
02:18:30,683 --> 02:18:33,986
[SPEAKER_01]: They were going to bring back a new DDR Arcade mix this year.

1741
02:18:34,666 --> 02:18:43,213
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why he posted it is because a second person heard about this and it wasn't from the poster's source.

1742
02:18:45,434 --> 02:18:45,775
[SPEAKER_06]: Sky?

1743
02:18:45,915 --> 02:18:47,316
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, yeah, no, no, I'm with you here.

1744
02:18:47,716 --> 02:18:48,837
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here, I'm with you.

1745
02:18:49,057 --> 02:18:49,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just listening to you.

1746
02:18:49,878 --> 02:18:51,059
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I posted up the link.

1747
02:18:51,299 --> 02:18:54,021
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm going to look at this link.

1748
02:18:54,301 --> 02:18:55,662
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

1749
02:18:55,682 --> 02:18:56,663
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he posted it.

1750
02:18:57,907 --> 02:19:04,891
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so, they said years ago that this was supposed to be the year that DDR comes back, and let's see, I'm gonna, let's, da-da-da-da-da.

1751
02:19:06,306 --> 02:19:07,907
[SPEAKER_06]: This comes from some guy's journal.

1752
02:19:07,947 --> 02:19:09,167
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen this guy around DDR3.

1753
02:19:09,208 --> 02:19:10,308
[SPEAKER_06]: Cucumber is the name.

1754
02:19:10,708 --> 02:19:12,729
[SPEAKER_06]: New DDR arcade makes its debut in September.

1755
02:19:12,789 --> 02:19:14,630
[SPEAKER_06]: Rumor, rumor, rumor.

1756
02:19:15,710 --> 02:19:23,614
[SPEAKER_06]: My first source said that an individual who has direct ties to Konami of Japan heard straight from them that DDR Extreme 2 will be previewed at Tokyo Game Show in September.

1757
02:19:24,014 --> 02:19:29,916
[SPEAKER_06]: They've supposedly changed the hardware to make the game unbootlegable, although I doubt it took since December 2002 to do that.

1758
02:19:30,336 --> 02:19:32,797
[SPEAKER_06]: My second source said there will be a location test in October.

1759
02:19:33,818 --> 02:19:33,898
[SPEAKER_06]: Um...

1760
02:19:35,518 --> 02:19:35,858
[SPEAKER_06]: I doubt it.

1761
02:19:36,038 --> 02:19:36,479
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1762
02:19:36,619 --> 02:19:40,321
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, honestly, I've got to tell you, Zaku, it's another rumor to me.

1763
02:19:40,721 --> 02:19:44,823
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems like every three months somebody's got the rumor they have a friend who knows Konami of Japan.

1764
02:19:46,590 --> 02:19:50,935
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the fact that a second person found out would mean that, you know, two things.

1765
02:19:51,275 --> 02:19:54,619
[SPEAKER_01]: A, that the rumor is probably, you know, spread to some other person.

1766
02:19:54,699 --> 02:19:58,303
[SPEAKER_01]: Or B, there might be a second person who might have found a credible source.

1767
02:19:58,383 --> 02:19:59,344
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could go either way.

1768
02:19:59,585 --> 02:20:00,946
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you're right.

1769
02:20:01,266 --> 02:20:02,788
[SPEAKER_06]: Any of these rumors could go either way.

1770
02:20:02,828 --> 02:20:06,712
[SPEAKER_06]: There's tons of things out there on the internet that are probably rumors now that will turn to fact later on.

1771
02:20:06,753 --> 02:20:07,073
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't know.

1772
02:20:07,633 --> 02:20:09,514
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's true.

1773
02:20:09,914 --> 02:20:11,554
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love it if this news were true.

1774
02:20:11,634 --> 02:20:12,314
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's true.

1775
02:20:12,994 --> 02:20:19,016
[SPEAKER_06]: The unbootlegable part is kind of sad because that means we probably won't see the machines here, but something tells me we'll see them one way or another.

1776
02:20:19,996 --> 02:20:20,776
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope it's true.

1777
02:20:20,916 --> 02:20:22,097
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what else I can add to that.

1778
02:20:22,197 --> 02:20:24,257
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no such thing as unbootlegable anything.

1779
02:20:24,297 --> 02:20:24,617
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I know.

1780
02:20:24,797 --> 02:20:25,538
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything's pirateable.

1781
02:20:25,578 --> 02:20:30,959
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope it's true, and I don't know what else to say.

1782
02:20:31,809 --> 02:20:33,810
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the signs are pretty clear right now.

1783
02:20:33,930 --> 02:20:42,915
[SPEAKER_01]: Politary is saying some stuff about recording a new song, and this, you know, I don't know whether or not it's adding up to something, but it's out there.

1784
02:20:43,375 --> 02:20:50,219
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not be true at first, but you know, it might be something that might be the basis for an official word.

1785
02:20:50,299 --> 02:20:52,460
[SPEAKER_01]: It ever does come to that point.

1786
02:20:52,600 --> 02:21:11,188
[SPEAKER_06]: I see how it also adds up together, you're right, the Politary and Naoki thing kind of going along with this makes everything kind of look add up, but also you have to realize, with three new games coming out in the US this year, three new DDR games and a Karaoke Revolution game, which, you know, it wouldn't surprise me if Naoki ever did something for that, you know, it's very possible that the Politary thing is for one of these games.

1787
02:21:11,988 --> 02:21:13,989
[SPEAKER_06]: But still, I mean, we just have to look at the possibilities.

1788
02:21:14,169 --> 02:21:14,929
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're right.

1789
02:21:15,189 --> 02:21:15,730
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you're right.

1790
02:21:15,750 --> 02:21:16,570
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope this guy's right.

1791
02:21:18,692 --> 02:21:45,557
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope I'm right, I mean, I just, you know, the only thing I'm, I don't know, maybe Konami might pull something out of their ass in E3 that might shock us all, that might shock us all and keep, and basically surprise the hell out of us, or, you know, maybe it might be when they drop the, when they release the new DDR games, I don't know, maybe some edit mode for some future arcade mix, now that they've already, you know, now that they have, you know, USB mode working, thank you Gran Turismo 4 for that.

1792
02:21:45,657 --> 02:21:47,357
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, it would, you know, it,

1793
02:21:49,377 --> 02:21:52,478
[SPEAKER_06]: It wouldn't be an E3 if somebody doesn't drop a bombshell.

1794
02:21:52,598 --> 02:21:56,319
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would love it for it to be to Konami, but who knows.

1795
02:21:56,539 --> 02:22:01,800
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami may have had it all already blown already from GamePro, thank you.

1796
02:22:01,880 --> 02:22:02,580
[SPEAKER_06]: So who knows.

1797
02:22:03,100 --> 02:22:07,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but they might have saved some of the stuff that hasn't seen light yet.

1798
02:22:07,901 --> 02:22:13,682
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically everything's ready for them to do almost about anything beyond the home release.

1799
02:22:14,478 --> 02:22:16,220
[SPEAKER_01]: as per saying a new arcade mix.

1800
02:22:16,401 --> 02:22:18,543
[SPEAKER_01]: They already have a third-party distributor up.

1801
02:22:19,464 --> 02:22:23,649
[SPEAKER_01]: It shouldn't be that hard to add USB slots to replace the memory card slots.

1802
02:22:23,669 --> 02:22:23,969
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?

1803
02:22:24,049 --> 02:22:26,933
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you brought... The Gran Turismo 4 is probably the first game to...

1804
02:22:27,355 --> 02:22:36,242
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm glad you brought the USB thing up because I'll tell you what, one thing that is really getting me into In The Groove and the arcade is the USB support.

1805
02:22:36,282 --> 02:22:37,303
[SPEAKER_06]: It is phenomenal.

1806
02:22:37,343 --> 02:22:40,285
[SPEAKER_06]: I actually picked up a jump drive so I could check out what this does.

1807
02:22:40,706 --> 02:22:44,509
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll tell you what, the In The Groove USB support damn near sells that game to me.

1808
02:22:44,849 --> 02:22:46,030
[SPEAKER_06]: It is that good.

1809
02:22:46,090 --> 02:22:48,432
[SPEAKER_06]: The USB support is phenomenal in that game.

1810
02:22:48,652 --> 02:22:50,876
[SPEAKER_06]: Almost as good as the Stepmania USB stick.

1811
02:22:50,936 --> 02:22:52,218
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1812
02:22:52,438 --> 02:22:53,480
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the same damn thing.

1813
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:54,081
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care.

1814
02:22:54,301 --> 02:22:55,963
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is something that's actually in the arcade.

1815
02:22:55,984 --> 02:22:56,504
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?

1816
02:22:56,564 --> 02:22:57,105
[SPEAKER_06]: It's different.

1817
02:22:57,165 --> 02:22:58,708
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not... Shut up.

1818
02:22:59,366 --> 02:23:24,724
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be surprised if Konami threw that in for their, you know, if they decided to continue to be on the arcades Konami should put mines in their game and show the in the groove folks how it feels Except they won't be mines, they'll be super bad stuff, or they'll be bombs or something, you know And stick it to the in the groove folks and let them know how it feels a little bit But don't take the hand plants idea, leave it in that other game

1819
02:23:26,837 --> 02:23:31,822
[SPEAKER_01]: Konami has the ability to wipe them out for all they care, but they're just waiting.

1820
02:23:32,082 --> 02:23:34,044
[SPEAKER_01]: They're waiting to see how In The Groove does.

1821
02:23:34,585 --> 02:23:39,049
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they'll probably bring out their big guns just to hold on to their market.

1822
02:23:39,209 --> 02:23:40,971
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my prediction right there.

1823
02:23:41,932 --> 02:23:42,893
[SPEAKER_01]: They're playing the waiting game.

1824
02:23:43,153 --> 02:23:44,174
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all they do.

1825
02:23:44,354 --> 02:23:46,316
[SPEAKER_06]: It's going to be a very interesting E3.

1826
02:23:46,396 --> 02:23:50,981
[SPEAKER_06]: I would love nothing more than for Konami and Red Octane to be right across from each other, but we know it won't happen.

1827
02:23:51,261 --> 02:23:56,404
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, as rivals, just holding fists like, like, like as if, you know, like a Mortal Kombat versus Green.

1828
02:23:56,604 --> 02:23:57,204
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what, though?

1829
02:23:57,645 --> 02:24:06,209
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite, despite anything negative I've said about in the groove in the past, competition benefits all of us in the long run.

1830
02:24:06,810 --> 02:24:09,051
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that's it right there.

1831
02:24:09,211 --> 02:24:10,411
[SPEAKER_01]: Competition will benefit us all.

1832
02:24:10,431 --> 02:24:12,052
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that basically spurs innovation.

1833
02:24:12,433 --> 02:24:15,234
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, I'm cutting, I'm, You have someone to go after.

1834
02:24:15,834 --> 02:24:17,255
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, I'm cutting you off now, Zaku.

1835
02:24:17,555 --> 02:24:18,136
[SPEAKER_06]: Closing time.

1836
02:24:18,436 --> 02:24:20,017
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here, buddy.

1837
02:24:20,117 --> 02:24:20,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, bye.

1838
02:24:22,085 --> 02:24:22,445
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1839
02:24:23,165 --> 02:24:25,106
[SPEAKER_17]: Nice quote of a song there.

1840
02:24:25,126 --> 02:24:25,606
[SPEAKER_05]: You're right.

1841
02:24:25,686 --> 02:24:26,086
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

1842
02:24:26,486 --> 02:24:27,126
[SPEAKER_05]: What, what, what, what?

1843
02:24:27,306 --> 02:24:35,468
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a cousin who knows a guy who knows a girl who's dating a guy who knows somebody at Konami.

1844
02:24:35,588 --> 02:24:36,208
[SPEAKER_05]: No, get this.

1845
02:24:36,288 --> 02:24:37,968
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, this is great.

1846
02:24:38,128 --> 02:24:41,089
[SPEAKER_05]: The new arcade system, it's going to have this little thing in the background.

1847
02:24:41,149 --> 02:24:43,450
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually going to be like some sort of score telling thing.

1848
02:24:44,330 --> 02:24:49,971
[SPEAKER_05]: If you do really good in it, you get contacted by aliens that actually take you up in their starship

1849
02:24:50,751 --> 02:24:56,535
[SPEAKER_05]: to go serve other aliens a la, like, The Last Starfighter.

1850
02:24:58,757 --> 02:24:59,598
[SPEAKER_05]: It's fucking awesome.

1851
02:24:59,658 --> 02:25:01,799
[SPEAKER_05]: Konami is taking on the universe, man!

1852
02:25:01,939 --> 02:25:02,500
[SPEAKER_06]: Loki, shut up.

1853
02:25:02,520 --> 02:25:03,120
[SPEAKER_06]: We got another call.

1854
02:25:03,621 --> 02:25:04,621
[SPEAKER_06]: You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

1855
02:25:07,103 --> 02:25:08,704
[SPEAKER_22]: Hello?

1856
02:25:08,965 --> 02:25:09,265
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi.

1857
02:25:10,165 --> 02:25:12,747
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you have to talk to your mom there in the background or something?

1858
02:25:12,807 --> 02:25:14,589
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounded like you were talking to somebody in the background.

1859
02:25:18,271 --> 02:25:19,112
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, someone else.

1860
02:25:19,172 --> 02:25:19,753
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what's up?

1861
02:25:19,793 --> 02:25:20,253
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1862
02:25:22,243 --> 02:25:26,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, the first question I have is about the Astro Printer pad.

1863
02:25:27,204 --> 02:25:27,484
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

1864
02:25:27,844 --> 02:25:41,188
[SPEAKER_22]: Now, I mean, originally I was going to get the bundle for Ending Groove with the Ignition pad, but now, I mean, I saw these screenshots that you guys showed, and you say it's probably, you know, like the best metal pad to get.

1865
02:25:41,208 --> 02:25:42,748
[SPEAKER_22]: The Cobalt Flux, at least.

1866
02:25:43,388 --> 02:25:45,429
[SPEAKER_22]: I haven't played Cobalt Flux, so I can't give an opinion on that.

1867
02:25:46,029 --> 02:25:46,889
[SPEAKER_22]: And save up more money.

1868
02:25:54,295 --> 02:25:56,978
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a Cobalt Flux and I just played on the Afterburner.

1869
02:25:57,418 --> 02:26:00,701
[SPEAKER_07]: I would honestly rather save the $100 and just play on the Afterburner.

1870
02:26:00,741 --> 02:26:03,224
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually prefer the Afterburner over the Cobalt Flux.

1871
02:26:03,984 --> 02:26:14,466
[SPEAKER_06]: We also got to play on Ignition 3.0, which is basically the new Ignition, it's just now they've taken the arrows and they've de-DDR'd them, and they're just these generic orange arrows now, and it also has USB support.

1872
02:26:14,706 --> 02:26:18,667
[SPEAKER_06]: The Ignition 3.0 honestly did nothing for me that Ignition 2.0 didn't already do.

1873
02:26:19,007 --> 02:26:22,208
[SPEAKER_06]: So Ignition 3.0 is the exact same as all the other Ignitions they put out.

1874
02:26:22,528 --> 02:26:29,109
[SPEAKER_06]: But After Burner, if you've got the money to drop, you really have to evaluate, how much will I use this thing?

1875
02:26:30,208 --> 02:26:37,792
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you think you're going to use it a lot, it's something you're going to play every day or every other day, make a part of your exercise routine, yes, I say it's worth the money.

1876
02:26:37,832 --> 02:26:45,955
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you honestly evaluate how much you play DDR, and see, for somebody like me, even though I talk a lot about DDR, how much do I actually go play it at home?

1877
02:26:46,096 --> 02:26:47,596
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't actually play at home a whole lot.

1878
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:49,117
[SPEAKER_06]: I prefer to go to the arcades.

1879
02:26:49,377 --> 02:26:52,298
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, I don't see the point in getting a metal stage.

1880
02:26:52,399 --> 02:26:55,320
[SPEAKER_06]: I would rather have the ignition pad because it's not worth it to me.

1881
02:26:55,740 --> 02:27:01,524
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you don't get to play DDR in the arcades a lot or whatever, and you think you're going to play this a lot at home, I say go for it.

1882
02:27:02,305 --> 02:27:02,985
[SPEAKER_06]: You won't regret it.

1883
02:27:04,566 --> 02:27:09,249
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't get to play it as much in arcades, so that's what I'm thinking about.

1884
02:27:09,269 --> 02:27:10,150
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright.

1885
02:27:10,190 --> 02:27:12,852
[SPEAKER_22]: But then again, I'm thinking, how long does it last?

1886
02:27:14,528 --> 02:27:15,989
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, that's a good question.

1887
02:27:16,009 --> 02:27:21,731
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, I'm not Red Octane, but I know it took a lot of abuse in the group night.

1888
02:27:21,791 --> 02:27:27,294
[SPEAKER_06]: People were playing with shoes on and heels and everything and playing the crazy songs and it seemed to hold up.

1889
02:27:27,374 --> 02:27:29,695
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the arrows are not acrylic.

1890
02:27:29,735 --> 02:27:33,877
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure there's some form of plexiglass, so they're not going to smash if you step on them 20 times.

1891
02:27:35,137 --> 02:27:44,350
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just, I don't know though, but you have to look, I've had ignition pads that die after six to nine months, so I'm hoping it's not the same thing with the afterburner, especially considering that kind of investment.

1892
02:27:44,671 --> 02:27:48,036
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately, until these things hit the market, we won't know how long they really last.

1893
02:27:48,236 --> 02:27:49,598
[SPEAKER_06]: So nobody can really say.

1894
02:27:50,019 --> 02:27:51,581
[SPEAKER_06]: You're taking a little bit of a gamble.

1895
02:27:52,021 --> 02:28:07,780
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say if Red Octane has some reasonable type, and I'm not familiar with Red Octane directly, I've always bought their products in stores when I've bought their products, but if they have some type of warranty replacement program as long as it's reasonable, I say go for it, because you don't know how long these things are going to last.

1896
02:28:09,662 --> 02:28:10,483
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, yeah, right.

1897
02:28:10,603 --> 02:28:11,943
[SPEAKER_22]: I'll probably get it then, thanks.

1898
02:28:12,223 --> 02:28:12,784
[SPEAKER_22]: Alright, no problem.

1899
02:28:12,804 --> 02:28:13,404
[SPEAKER_22]: Anything else for us?

1900
02:28:14,925 --> 02:28:16,146
[SPEAKER_22]: Um, probably.

1901
02:28:16,186 --> 02:28:20,848
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, I have a lot of opinions now in the group since I actually finally got to play it last week.

1902
02:28:21,068 --> 02:28:21,789
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, what do you think?

1903
02:28:21,809 --> 02:28:24,831
[SPEAKER_22]: So, I mean, it's pretty interesting.

1904
02:28:25,151 --> 02:28:34,116
[SPEAKER_22]: Like, I don't like how it's such a... It's not as varied as DDR is with the music, which is probably my biggest problem.

1905
02:28:34,356 --> 02:28:34,496
[SPEAKER_22]: Mm-hmm.

1906
02:28:36,047 --> 02:28:37,528
[SPEAKER_22]: But otherwise, it looks pretty good.

1907
02:28:37,568 --> 02:28:39,889
[SPEAKER_22]: I mean, the difficulty is really hard, but whatever.

1908
02:28:41,150 --> 02:28:45,452
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm willing to dish out money for the home version anyway, just for something new to play.

1909
02:28:45,852 --> 02:28:48,914
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I mean, it's going to be, what, $30, I think?

1910
02:28:49,054 --> 02:28:50,575
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't quote me on that.

1911
02:28:50,595 --> 02:28:50,975
[SPEAKER_06]: $40 at most.

1912
02:28:51,955 --> 02:28:52,856
[SPEAKER_06]: And you get a t-shirt.

1913
02:28:54,797 --> 02:28:55,337
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

1914
02:28:55,497 --> 02:28:57,538
[SPEAKER_06]: A keychain.

1915
02:28:57,658 --> 02:29:03,941
[SPEAKER_06]: People that are dedicated to these games enough to be tuning into this show are probably not going to regret the purchase, honestly.

1916
02:29:04,482 --> 02:29:05,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Just go for it.

1917
02:29:06,437 --> 02:29:07,418
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, definitely.

1918
02:29:07,738 --> 02:29:10,720
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, well I'm going to let you go so we can take some more calls, but thanks for calling in, alright?

1919
02:29:11,761 --> 02:29:16,064
[SPEAKER_05]: There will be a day where I will review in the group someday.

1920
02:29:16,985 --> 02:29:18,766
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's take one more call here.

1921
02:29:19,907 --> 02:29:21,288
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you are on Orange Lounge Radio.

1922
02:29:22,389 --> 02:29:22,949
[SPEAKER_16]: Hey guys.

1923
02:29:23,450 --> 02:29:24,691
[SPEAKER_06]: Hello, is this Angel?

1924
02:29:25,551 --> 02:29:25,852
[SPEAKER_16]: Yep.

1925
02:29:26,032 --> 02:29:26,752
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

1926
02:29:26,972 --> 02:29:27,973
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not here tonight!

1927
02:29:29,214 --> 02:29:29,754
[SPEAKER_16]: I know.

1928
02:29:29,855 --> 02:29:30,315
[SPEAKER_06]: What's going on?

1929
02:29:31,542 --> 02:29:32,503
[SPEAKER_16]: Sicker than crap.

1930
02:29:33,904 --> 02:29:34,564
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry to hear it.

1931
02:29:34,924 --> 02:29:37,846
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I know that you feel better, first off.

1932
02:29:37,886 --> 02:29:38,627
[SPEAKER_06]: Rest up and feel better.

1933
02:29:39,247 --> 02:29:39,768
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

1934
02:29:39,788 --> 02:29:49,094
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you had to go to the In The Groove party because I had to beg somebody to go with me because Jamie had to... Matt had to work and Jamie had the school thing, so I was begging LiveJournal and you took it up.

1935
02:29:49,494 --> 02:29:50,275
[SPEAKER_06]: So you had to go.

1936
02:29:50,435 --> 02:29:50,875
[SPEAKER_06]: What did you think?

1937
02:29:52,456 --> 02:29:53,677
[SPEAKER_16]: I thought it was awesome.

1938
02:29:54,057 --> 02:29:57,600
[SPEAKER_16]: It's going to give me something to do while I'm waiting for...

1939
02:29:59,469 --> 02:30:02,251
[SPEAKER_16]: Extreme 2 and Ultramix 3.

1940
02:30:03,291 --> 02:30:04,572
[SPEAKER_16]: It's just going to be a filler.

1941
02:30:05,492 --> 02:30:07,753
[SPEAKER_16]: I like both games differently.

1942
02:30:07,813 --> 02:30:09,214
[SPEAKER_16]: I like DDR for DDR.

1943
02:30:09,234 --> 02:30:11,195
[SPEAKER_16]: I like in the group for in the group.

1944
02:30:11,275 --> 02:30:21,501
[SPEAKER_16]: So I'm not going to sit there and knock it because I'm still getting exercise and I'm still liking the music that either game offers.

1945
02:30:23,021 --> 02:30:24,782
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's a very fair way to look at it.

1946
02:30:24,822 --> 02:30:25,303
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

1947
02:30:25,343 --> 02:30:25,603
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just...

1948
02:30:26,883 --> 02:30:28,784
[SPEAKER_06]: Bitch and cry and moan all you want.

1949
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:35,346
[SPEAKER_06]: Both these games are out there and they're going to be available, so why not eat them up and just enjoy what both games have to offer.

1950
02:30:36,647 --> 02:30:46,151
[SPEAKER_16]: And I'm glad that you guys liked the Afterburner because I wanted to try it, but I was just not wearing the right shoes that day, so I was just like, eh, I don't want to kill myself.

1951
02:30:47,591 --> 02:30:51,733
[SPEAKER_16]: So I might actually end up buying that with the games.

1952
02:30:51,913 --> 02:30:54,274
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

1953
02:30:54,294 --> 02:30:54,974
[SPEAKER_16]: Oh, and you forgot...

1954
02:30:55,902 --> 02:30:57,062
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, Angel?

1955
02:30:58,983 --> 02:31:04,804
[SPEAKER_16]: You forgot the little spoof about you and the bar when Pirate was trying to play.

1956
02:31:04,824 --> 02:31:07,625
[SPEAKER_16]: That was pretty funny when we all raided the press room.

1957
02:31:07,665 --> 02:31:08,925
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, God, that's right.

1958
02:31:08,985 --> 02:31:09,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, remember this?

1959
02:31:09,945 --> 02:31:18,947
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, because they took the stool away from Toadie, what I ended up doing when we were in the media room is you decided you were going to play some insane song.

1960
02:31:19,307 --> 02:31:23,691
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was like, here, hold on to my hand, and you can use my hand as the bar, and he did it.

1961
02:31:23,911 --> 02:31:24,351
[SPEAKER_06]: It worked.

1962
02:31:24,611 --> 02:31:26,052
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how people are going to have to do it at home.

1963
02:31:26,092 --> 02:31:31,417
[SPEAKER_06]: He held on to my hand, not in a homosexual way, but he held on to my hand as the bar, and he played, and it actually worked.

1964
02:31:31,737 --> 02:31:36,401
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the guys, whoever was dancing next to you, I didn't know him, but you... I think his name was Andre.

1965
02:31:36,421 --> 02:31:37,161
[SPEAKER_07]: He's from Oregon.

1966
02:31:37,421 --> 02:31:41,404
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, well, he did the same thing, and I actually snapped a picture of it.

1967
02:31:41,424 --> 02:31:41,805
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I saw that one.

1968
02:31:41,845 --> 02:31:45,728
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody commented on the website about that, like, dude, is somebody using a hand as the bar?

1969
02:31:45,768 --> 02:31:48,170
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, because we... And I would like to say that was my idea.

1970
02:31:48,190 --> 02:31:48,270
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

1971
02:31:48,690 --> 02:31:49,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Copyright.

1972
02:31:49,210 --> 02:31:50,431
[SPEAKER_07]: That was my idea.

1973
02:31:50,972 --> 02:31:51,412
[SPEAKER_07]: Patent pending.

1974
02:31:51,432 --> 02:31:52,052
[SPEAKER_07]: That was great.

1975
02:31:53,133 --> 02:31:53,333
[SPEAKER_07]: Yay.

1976
02:31:53,733 --> 02:31:54,073
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

1977
02:31:54,794 --> 02:31:57,756
[SPEAKER_16]: Anyway, hide a pirate and hide everyone there.

1978
02:31:57,996 --> 02:31:59,217
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm sorry I'm not there, but hey.

1979
02:31:59,417 --> 02:32:00,558
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, feel better.

1980
02:32:00,618 --> 02:32:03,299
[SPEAKER_07]: I take it we're not meeting at CCL on Tuesday.

1981
02:32:04,420 --> 02:32:06,041
[SPEAKER_16]: Actually, I... I will be there.

1982
02:32:06,281 --> 02:32:07,062
[SPEAKER_16]: I think we are.

1983
02:32:07,142 --> 02:32:08,362
[SPEAKER_16]: Talk to your girlfriend.

1984
02:32:08,502 --> 02:32:08,943
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

1985
02:32:09,083 --> 02:32:09,343
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1986
02:32:09,423 --> 02:32:09,783
[SPEAKER_06]: Will do.

1987
02:32:10,163 --> 02:32:10,404
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

1988
02:32:10,444 --> 02:32:11,104
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one, Angel.

1989
02:32:11,244 --> 02:32:11,744
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for calling.

1990
02:32:11,965 --> 02:32:12,205
[SPEAKER_16]: All right.

1991
02:32:12,285 --> 02:32:12,705
[SPEAKER_16]: Bye, guys.

1992
02:32:12,725 --> 02:32:13,145
[SPEAKER_06]: Bye.

1993
02:32:13,285 --> 02:32:13,726
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a good one.

1994
02:32:16,007 --> 02:32:16,887
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it was arm raping.

1995
02:32:16,927 --> 02:32:17,528
[SPEAKER_06]: It was pretty hot.

1996
02:32:17,668 --> 02:32:18,188
[SPEAKER_06]: It was hot.

1997
02:32:18,468 --> 02:32:19,528
[SPEAKER_06]: One other thing I've got to say.

1998
02:32:19,688 --> 02:32:22,829
[SPEAKER_06]: I noticed, because sometimes I look at people chatting on different forums.

1999
02:32:23,210 --> 02:32:31,132
[SPEAKER_06]: How many different places did you say, Rob took three pictures of my ass and put them on the Horizons Radio Gallery for you all to see?

2000
02:32:31,852 --> 02:32:33,993
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I put it on two different places.

2001
02:32:34,013 --> 02:32:35,594
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on my LiveJournal and then...

2002
02:32:37,035 --> 02:32:39,297
[SPEAKER_07]: I know I commented on the Orange Lounge site.

2003
02:32:39,317 --> 02:32:40,017
[SPEAKER_07]: That might have been it.

2004
02:32:40,057 --> 02:32:44,400
[SPEAKER_06]: It just seemed like everywhere I was reading you said something about, God, Rob takes all these pictures of my ass.

2005
02:32:45,000 --> 02:32:46,822
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, it is a nice ass.

2006
02:32:47,362 --> 02:32:48,343
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even exist.

2007
02:32:48,383 --> 02:32:49,964
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even have one at my body weight.

2008
02:32:50,524 --> 02:32:51,004
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?

2009
02:32:51,024 --> 02:32:55,067
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just trying to get pictures of ham plants because I was actually going to do something with no ham plants.

2010
02:32:55,087 --> 02:32:55,627
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe you.

2011
02:32:55,647 --> 02:32:55,988
[SPEAKER_06]: You're right.

2012
02:32:56,028 --> 02:32:56,828
[SPEAKER_06]: It was all about your ass.

2013
02:32:56,888 --> 02:32:57,188
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2014
02:32:58,049 --> 02:32:59,010
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2015
02:32:59,050 --> 02:32:59,690
[SPEAKER_06]: Personal on Skyline.

2016
02:33:02,830 --> 02:33:03,651
[SPEAKER_03]: Greetings from New York.

2017
02:33:03,731 --> 02:33:04,651
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the one and only Ranma.

2018
02:33:04,691 --> 02:33:05,392
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing?

2019
02:33:05,572 --> 02:33:05,832
[SPEAKER_06]: Good.

2020
02:33:05,872 --> 02:33:06,513
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you, Ranma?

2021
02:33:06,533 --> 02:33:06,993
[SPEAKER_06]: What's on your mind?

2022
02:33:09,855 --> 02:33:10,175
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty good.

2023
02:33:10,495 --> 02:33:14,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to give you my quick Anime Boston review wrap-up in like 14 minutes.

2024
02:33:14,818 --> 02:33:17,680
[SPEAKER_06]: Make it really, really, really quick because you're actually breaking up a little bit.

2025
02:33:17,720 --> 02:33:20,102
[SPEAKER_06]: Your voice is breaking there, so make it quick.

2026
02:33:23,226 --> 02:33:24,487
[SPEAKER_03]: Crap, I'm gonna make it really quick.

2027
02:33:24,547 --> 02:33:25,908
[SPEAKER_03]: Anime Boss was great.

2028
02:33:26,008 --> 02:33:27,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna play DD on Forever.

2029
02:33:27,490 --> 02:33:29,211
[SPEAKER_03]: The Tokyo Game Action guys say hi.

2030
02:33:29,571 --> 02:33:31,893
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, the masquerade kind of sucked.

2031
02:33:31,933 --> 02:33:36,016
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems if you made your own costume, but you wore shoes, you automatically disqualified.

2032
02:33:36,877 --> 02:33:37,177
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

2033
02:33:37,237 --> 02:33:37,878
[SPEAKER_03]: You wore shoes?

2034
02:33:37,898 --> 02:33:39,039
[SPEAKER_03]: You got the... What the hell?

2035
02:33:41,241 --> 02:33:41,501
[SPEAKER_06]: Whatever.

2036
02:33:42,852 --> 02:33:44,412
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know what?

2037
02:33:44,432 --> 02:33:47,973
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get out to some anime cons and get our name out there some more.

2038
02:33:48,273 --> 02:33:49,233
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to go or something.

2039
02:33:49,273 --> 02:33:50,214
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to get a little room.

2040
02:33:50,614 --> 02:33:51,734
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to travel to the East Coast.

2041
02:33:51,994 --> 02:33:53,934
[SPEAKER_06]: Some East Coast person fly us out there.

2042
02:33:53,974 --> 02:33:56,215
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll do a table thing or whatever.

2043
02:33:56,255 --> 02:33:56,775
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll be fun.

2044
02:33:56,955 --> 02:34:02,616
[SPEAKER_03]: Dude, if y'all fly out to the East Coast, y'all can stay in my room for free.

2045
02:34:02,956 --> 02:34:04,637
[SPEAKER_06]: You promise not to take advantage of us, right?

2046
02:34:05,677 --> 02:34:06,057
[SPEAKER_06]: Never.

2047
02:34:06,277 --> 02:34:06,577
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2048
02:34:06,917 --> 02:34:07,397
[SPEAKER_06]: Sounds good.

2049
02:34:07,417 --> 02:34:09,158
[SPEAKER_17]: We've got to get an opportunity to cosplay.

2050
02:34:10,518 --> 02:34:10,738
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.

2051
02:34:11,277 --> 02:34:12,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you for the offer.

2052
02:34:12,199 --> 02:34:12,861
[SPEAKER_06]: We appreciate it.

2053
02:34:14,044 --> 02:34:16,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, buddy, because you're kind of breaking up, I'm going to let you go.

02:40:47,113 --> 02:40:55,725
[SPEAKER_21]: Hiho, Kermit the Frog here, informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio is brought to you by the letter V, the letter A, and the number 59.

2067
02:41:01,135 --> 02:41:14,343
[SPEAKER_06]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and now it's time for that part of the show where we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the week, which, by the way, we have new background music for tonight, all of us.

2068
02:41:14,543 --> 02:41:15,224
[SPEAKER_06]: Yay!

2069
02:41:15,324 --> 02:41:16,624
[SPEAKER_17]: I already missed my old one.

2070
02:41:16,684 --> 02:41:18,005
[SPEAKER_06]: If you were getting sick of those songs.

2071
02:41:18,185 --> 02:41:20,787
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, you know, I could start it off with your old one and then get into the new one.

2072
02:41:20,987 --> 02:41:21,687
[SPEAKER_17]: That's okay.

2073
02:41:21,747 --> 02:41:22,928
[SPEAKER_06]: I do kind of like the way it started.

2074
02:41:23,188 --> 02:41:25,130
[SPEAKER_17]: This one starts off and changes.

2075
02:41:25,230 --> 02:41:25,790
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, we'll do that.

2076
02:41:26,350 --> 02:41:30,652
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, okay, so, why is it we do the FUs of the week every single week, DarkSakura?

2077
02:41:30,972 --> 02:41:31,732
[SPEAKER_17]: Eh, fuck it.

2078
02:41:47,139 --> 02:41:53,682
[SPEAKER_17]: My FU goes toward, um, this Tittle Insurance Company, it's spelled T-I-T-T-L-E.

2079
02:41:54,420 --> 02:42:01,044
[SPEAKER_17]: And when I first looked, I was like, well, no, I was thinking maybe it's title, and they misspelled it, but no.

2080
02:42:02,885 --> 02:42:14,612
[SPEAKER_17]: Anyway, this, and actually, I transferred from person to person, then to another claims company, then to another claims company here in Sacramento, and it's just been stupid.

2081
02:42:14,652 --> 02:42:17,673
[SPEAKER_17]: He calls me and says, well, call me back, blah, blah, blah.

2082
02:42:17,693 --> 02:42:20,255
[SPEAKER_17]: So I leave him two fucking messages, and he never calls me back, the bastard.

2083
02:42:21,596 --> 02:42:21,796
[SPEAKER_17]: So...

2084
02:42:22,847 --> 02:42:25,968
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna have to wait again to find out when I get my damn money to fix my damn car.

2085
02:42:27,048 --> 02:42:31,469
[SPEAKER_17]: Um, my fiance was supposed to hammer my, uh, fender back into place so that I could at least drive it.

2086
02:42:32,990 --> 02:42:33,830
[SPEAKER_17]: No, it rained.

2087
02:42:34,350 --> 02:42:34,850
[SPEAKER_17]: Sorry!

2088
02:42:36,171 --> 02:42:39,832
[SPEAKER_17]: Um... You know, I just really miss having a car.

2089
02:42:40,372 --> 02:42:44,173
[SPEAKER_17]: I-I feel like... Like my left arm's been cut off.

2090
02:42:44,273 --> 02:42:47,434
[SPEAKER_17]: You know, you can function without a left arm, but it fucking sucks.

2091
02:42:48,154 --> 02:42:48,875
[SPEAKER_17]: And that's how I feel.

2092
02:42:50,175 --> 02:42:50,255
[SPEAKER_17]: Um...

2093
02:42:52,977 --> 02:43:01,983
[SPEAKER_17]: Uh, apart from that, um, you know, fuck the people who have no sense of adventure and don't like anything new.

2094
02:43:02,583 --> 02:43:04,424
[SPEAKER_17]: Because you don't fucking give it a chance!

2095
02:43:06,365 --> 02:43:06,985
[SPEAKER_17]: Okay, I'm done.

2096
02:43:08,106 --> 02:43:09,887
[SPEAKER_06]: And now we move on to Loki.

2097
02:43:13,269 --> 02:43:13,890
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyways...

2098
02:43:16,704 --> 02:43:17,564
[SPEAKER_05]: I love this song.

2099
02:43:20,826 --> 02:43:25,668
[SPEAKER_05]: First FU goes to Epson and their wonderful printers and ink.

2100
02:43:26,368 --> 02:43:34,191
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know, and this is an unknown fact here, did you know it's actually cheaper to buy a new printer than to buy cartridges for said printer?

2101
02:43:35,396 --> 02:43:36,277
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty sad.

2102
02:43:37,357 --> 02:43:42,640
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's great, though, is they actually have their cartridges.

2103
02:43:42,780 --> 02:43:46,822
[SPEAKER_05]: It literally would have cost me like 60 bucks to actually buy a cartridge.

2104
02:43:46,842 --> 02:43:49,063
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cartridges for this stupid printer.

2105
02:43:49,423 --> 02:43:51,484
[SPEAKER_05]: And the printers have, the cartridges have timed...

2106
02:43:52,765 --> 02:43:57,888
[SPEAKER_05]: This, like, programming is basically timed, so after a certain amount of time, whether you're using it or not, it'll say it's empty.

2107
02:43:58,449 --> 02:43:59,429
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Epson!

2108
02:43:59,750 --> 02:44:01,651
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate your wonderful product there.

2109
02:44:02,171 --> 02:44:03,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what, folks?

2110
02:44:03,792 --> 02:44:05,133
[SPEAKER_05]: I ain't gonna play by that.

2111
02:44:05,453 --> 02:44:13,779
[SPEAKER_05]: So, um, I bought new, cheaper cartridges, and I bought a- and I also got a program for free that locks in the value so that it will just work until it's done.

2112
02:44:16,580 --> 02:44:20,503
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, fuck you too, stupid people driving your cars, cause-

2113
02:44:20,984 --> 02:44:25,986
[SPEAKER_05]: For some reason, you just don't understand what that stupid little flashy light is that's on the corner of your cars.

2114
02:44:26,026 --> 02:44:26,306
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

2115
02:44:26,326 --> 02:44:27,147
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a turn signal.

2116
02:44:28,047 --> 02:44:31,048
[SPEAKER_05]: People use it to signal when they're changing lanes.

2117
02:44:31,909 --> 02:44:33,449
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe you should learn how to do that.

2118
02:44:33,609 --> 02:44:33,970
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.

2119
02:44:36,072 --> 02:44:42,475
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to Ridley Scott for wasting two and a half hours of my life with a crappy movie called Kingdom of Heaven.

2120
02:44:43,075 --> 02:44:46,937
[SPEAKER_05]: Should have known that it was going to suck when the word heaven was in the title.

2121
02:44:47,257 --> 02:44:48,457
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?

2122
02:44:48,698 --> 02:44:49,158
[SPEAKER_05]: Guess what?

2123
02:44:49,318 --> 02:44:50,078
[SPEAKER_05]: The movie sucked.

2124
02:44:50,118 --> 02:44:56,081
[SPEAKER_05]: It's basically if you took all the battles from Lord of the Rings and made them anticlimactic, that would be the movie.

2125
02:44:57,061 --> 02:44:57,521
[SPEAKER_05]: Enjoy.

2126
02:44:58,282 --> 02:44:58,762
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucked.

2127
02:44:59,881 --> 02:45:06,283
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, finally, um, fuck you to, um, the really crappy party you had in Final Fantasy XI.

2128
02:45:06,423 --> 02:45:13,764
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been, like, not playing for, like, a while now, and I finally got back into playing, and the first thing I get is a party that lasts for two battles, and then it's over.

2129
02:45:15,765 --> 02:45:18,225
[SPEAKER_05]: Fucking sucked ass.

2130
02:45:19,326 --> 02:45:24,347
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, um... Finally, um...

2131
02:45:26,787 --> 02:45:30,849
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to Fox for having Family Guy at 8 o'clock because I want to watch it and I'm going to miss it.

2132
02:45:31,169 --> 02:45:32,430
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to people who don't have a TiVo.

2133
02:45:33,490 --> 02:45:34,311
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually, wait, that would be me.

2134
02:45:34,411 --> 02:45:34,891
[SPEAKER_17]: You know what?

2135
02:45:34,931 --> 02:45:37,492
[SPEAKER_17]: Some of us aren't reliant on television for our sense of entertainment.

2136
02:45:37,652 --> 02:45:38,713
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I don't need TiVo.

2137
02:45:38,813 --> 02:45:39,513
[SPEAKER_05]: I have BitTorrent.

2138
02:45:40,934 --> 02:45:41,214
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm done.

2139
02:45:42,315 --> 02:45:42,875
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, my turn.

2140
02:45:47,695 --> 02:46:06,558
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to give an F you to a general like just being tired and exhaustedness this weekend because I've been doing stuff like the past couple weeks in a row so I just you know I finally just kind of hit I was like I hit the point where I'm like I don't want to do anything at all ever except stay at home and lie in bed all day

2141
02:46:07,229 --> 02:46:23,460
[SPEAKER_06]: so that's kind of the weekend I have so F you to laziness F you to the fact that we were a little bit disorganized in making E3 plans so we're kind of stuck in a not so great hotel but that's alright because at least we're going so I'm very happy about that by the way I am going for sure absolutely by the way I forgot to tell you thanks I found out so

2142
02:46:24,243 --> 02:46:27,024

2143
02:46:27,184 --> 02:46:27,964
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that would be great.

2144
02:46:28,965 --> 02:46:30,645
[SPEAKER_06]: So, let's see.

2145
02:46:30,765 --> 02:46:31,245
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that about it?

2146
02:46:31,725 --> 02:46:38,548
[SPEAKER_06]: And F you to the fact that I have not one, not two, but three classes to teach next week and one of them is on a Saturday.

2147

[SPEAKER_06]: F you to working on Saturdays.

2148
02:46:40,168 --> 02:46:41,268
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a horrible, horrible fate.

2149
02:46:42,369 --> 02:46:46,050
[SPEAKER_06]: That anybody who works a Monday through Friday age five job should not have to do is working Saturday.

2150
02:46:46,838 --> 02:46:47,559
[SPEAKER_17]: Amen to that!

[SPEAKER_06]: So, FU to Saturday working.

2153
02:46:50,100 --> 02:46:53,002
[SPEAKER_06]: But then, I get the whole next week off, so I guess I can't bitch too much.

2154
02:46:53,302 --> 02:46:53,803
[SPEAKER_06]: What can I say?

2155
02:46:55,384 --> 02:46:59,847
[SPEAKER_06]: Alright, let's go over to Toadie and find out Toadie's FUs for tonight.

2156
02:47:00,507 --> 02:47:02,969
[SPEAKER_07]: First one, from the Wednesday night.

2157
02:47:03,169 --> 02:47:09,873
[SPEAKER_07]: Fuck pretty much the entire city of San Francisco for having like a transportation system that doesn't make any fucking sense.

2158
02:47:10,674 --> 02:47:16,518
[SPEAKER_07]: Why do I have to drive like ten blocks down streets that don't make me make a left-hand turn?

2159
02:47:17,148 --> 02:47:45,827
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to get to a parking garage that charges me $11 For like, oh, three hours and five minutes Kiss my ass, I wanted those two dollars back Anyway, uh, and then the other one I have is, uh Fuck California's statutory rape laws Going back to the Myspace thing earlier I wish I just lived, you know, a hundred miles away in Nevada Sixteen years old and you're done with it This is bullshit over here, I'm sorry I'm good Alright, that's it, I, no, no

2160
02:47:46,144 --> 02:47:54,357
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck you to Sega for having Super Monkey Ball Deluxe be such a crappy game.

2161
02:47:54,598 --> 02:47:54,878
[SPEAKER_05]: The end.

2162
02:47:56,821 --> 02:47:58,304
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's get to the chatroom, shall we?

2163
02:47:59,268 --> 02:48:17,241
[SPEAKER_06]: Angel says F you to being so sick that I hardly have energy to do much of anything F you to the rain on Wednesday while Sky and I were in the city oh yes because we weren't prepared don't okay that's all I forgot we got rained on on Wednesday that sucked Illusion says F you to people that are complaining about oops I did it again being an EX2 it's all about oops three snaps

2164
02:48:18,499 --> 02:48:22,863
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to Family Guy for distracting me from the show and probably keeping me from even hearing the FUs.

2165
02:48:22,923 --> 02:48:23,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey!

2166
02:48:23,584 --> 02:48:24,144
[SPEAKER_06]: Get a VCR.

2167
02:48:24,785 --> 02:48:26,266
[SPEAKER_06]: FU to anyone that doesn't see Crash.

2168
02:48:26,306 --> 02:48:26,986
[SPEAKER_06]: It was amazing.

2169
02:48:27,046 --> 02:48:28,768
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got to have a Best Picture nomination locked.

2170
02:48:28,848 --> 02:48:31,911
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, that's not really an FU, but more of me whoring Crash out.

2171
02:48:32,972 --> 02:48:36,815
[SPEAKER_06]: Jin4576 says, FU to Finals Week and work sucking.

2172
02:48:37,495 --> 02:48:41,399
[SPEAKER_06]: Ranma says, FU to the DDR fanboys and girls that are beefing about In The Groove.

2173
02:48:41,719 --> 02:48:42,380
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just a game.

2174
02:48:42,420 --> 02:48:42,860
[SPEAKER_06]: Relax.

2175
02:48:42,920 --> 02:48:45,602
[SPEAKER_06]: Just because you suck at In The Groove, that don't give you the right to bitch.

2176
02:48:45,803 --> 02:48:46,143
[SPEAKER_06]: Bring it.

2177
02:48:46,693 --> 02:48:48,875
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already been broughten, sir or ma'am.

2178
02:48:49,415 --> 02:48:51,457
[SPEAKER_06]: MPQ says, A big F you to children.

2179
02:48:51,937 --> 02:48:52,678
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate children.

2180
02:48:52,718 --> 02:48:57,301
[SPEAKER_06]: My sister has to take care of this doll thing for a school project and it drives me insane.

2181
02:48:57,721 --> 02:48:58,142
[SPEAKER_06]: I hate it.

2182
02:48:58,502 --> 02:49:00,784
[SPEAKER_06]: If it didn't cost $500, I would have broken it already.

2183
02:49:00,864 --> 02:49:02,525
[SPEAKER_06]: I absolutely despise children.

2184
02:49:05,487 --> 02:49:14,494
[SPEAKER_06]: AUKY says, My F yous of the week are, I didn't get to go to the launch party and then I ended up getting sick anyway.

2185
02:49:15,315 --> 02:49:15,555
[SPEAKER_06]: Dope.

2186
02:49:17,443 --> 02:49:21,866
[SPEAKER_06]: Alex L. Dubes says, my FU goes to my parents for leaving to Melbourne without me.

2187
02:49:22,326 --> 02:49:25,068
[SPEAKER_06]: Because of them, I didn't get to play on the in-the-groove machine they have there.

2188
02:49:25,168 --> 02:49:27,490
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the only one they have in Florida.

2189
02:49:30,391 --> 02:49:34,534
[SPEAKER_06]: RPG King says, FU to only seeing my girlfriend once a week for the past month.

2190
02:49:34,574 --> 02:49:36,595
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that will change as we get closer to the summer.

2191
02:49:37,316 --> 02:49:40,378
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, FU to bar huggers at our local DDR tourney.

2192
02:49:40,658 --> 02:49:42,099
[SPEAKER_06]: They need to be weaned off the bar.

2193
02:49:42,319 --> 02:49:42,639
[SPEAKER_06]: Toady?

2194
02:49:43,080 --> 02:49:43,560
[SPEAKER_06]: Shut up.

2195
02:49:46,257 --> 02:50:11,885
[SPEAKER_06]: the official bar whore of Orange Lounge Radio SSJ100 Matt to my cell phone about to break FU super glue is holding it together right now and I can't afford a new phone and my warranty is shot duct tape is the universal solution to the Red Sox and FU father and son team who heckled me in the parking lot for wearing a Yankee jersey screw them go Yanks FU to time for not going fast enough because I can't wait to go back home to New York on Friday

2196
02:50:13,959 --> 02:50:39,731
[SPEAKER_06]: Legend of Zaku says F you to the murder of a discreet math final I have to take tomorrow morning F you to nearly killing my old ignition pad when repairing it only to make the fixed arrows a lot more stiffer at least I still have my uber elite BNS ignition pad and F you to moving back home and having to put up with dial up again meaning I won't be listening to your show or be on Skype for that matter until I either get back on campus in the fall or get broadband this and he got cut off but I'm assuming it's summer

2197
02:50:41,554 --> 02:50:43,656
[SPEAKER_06]: Dark Tetsuya says F you to Sure West.

2198
02:50:43,696 --> 02:50:47,839
[SPEAKER_06]: Our phone line has been in and out of commission the past few days, thus limiting my internet.

2199
02:50:49,080 --> 02:50:52,742
[SPEAKER_06]: And lastly, Dark Knight says my F you is to depression, end of line.

2200
02:50:53,142 --> 02:50:55,084
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and F you to being broke and not having a car.

2201
02:50:58,546 --> 02:50:58,947
[SPEAKER_06]: The end.

2202
02:50:59,127 --> 02:51:00,188
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are so angsty.

2203
02:51:03,110 --> 02:51:03,510
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm proud.

2204
02:51:03,690 --> 02:51:04,891
[SPEAKER_05]: We must talk about something.

2205
02:51:05,296 --> 02:51:06,256
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, what, Loki, what's up?

2206
02:51:06,596 --> 02:51:11,938
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we didn't talk about Red Octane's... We didn't, I was just about to get to it, if you'd hold on.

2207
02:51:12,738 --> 02:51:15,159
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I don't know where you're going, there's no set plan.

2208
02:51:16,019 --> 02:51:18,699
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you're right, that's the wonderful thing about this show, is that there's no set plan.

2209
02:51:19,200 --> 02:51:20,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Orange Lounge Radio, no set plan.

2210
02:51:22,900 --> 02:51:25,621
[SPEAKER_05]: Orange Lounge Radio and the Bush presidency.

2211
02:51:26,001 --> 02:51:26,681
[SPEAKER_05]: Eh, we don't have a plan.

2212
02:51:31,341 --> 02:51:51,506
[SPEAKER_06]: Guitar Hero is the new game that Red Octane announced this week but this is interesting because we're not sure to what extent they actually meant to announce this because they actually ended up taking down their website for it so they're kind of trying to pretend it didn't exist I think it's one of those cases where it was an E3 surprise it was supposed to be a surprise at E3 and surprise!

2213
02:51:51,586 --> 02:51:57,628
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody leaked your website out so now the whole internet knows about it so, oh well

2214
02:51:58,415 --> 02:52:01,979
[SPEAKER_06]: Red Octane is going to be doing Guitar Hero for PlayStation 2 in the fall of this year.

2215
02:52:03,460 --> 02:52:18,213
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting, by the way, to note that Red Octane for a long time, and I don't know if they still are, but at least I know previously when the Guitar Freaks games were big on PlayStation 2, they were doing five-button guitar controllers that were for use with the Guitar Freaks.

2216
02:52:19,315 --> 02:52:22,036
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's very interesting that they're doing this.

2217
02:52:22,096 --> 02:52:24,557
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this a game to try and promote sales of those controllers?

2218
02:52:24,857 --> 02:52:26,297
[SPEAKER_06]: Or will it be a whole new controller?

2219
02:52:26,337 --> 02:52:27,177
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know just yet.

2220
02:52:27,517 --> 02:52:31,299
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do know a lot of people have bitched about the fact that there have been no new Guitar Freak games.

2221
02:52:31,759 --> 02:52:34,219
[SPEAKER_06]: And not to say that this game is going to be a Guitar Freak's clone.

2222
02:52:34,279 --> 02:52:36,120
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't know, but we can kind of...

2223
02:52:36,720 --> 02:52:43,504
[SPEAKER_05]: Basing my judgment only on their website and just how it looked, they put a lot of detail on that website.

2224
02:52:44,084 --> 02:52:47,066
[SPEAKER_05]: And if that same amount of detail is in the game, it should be really good.

2225
02:52:47,286 --> 02:52:48,147
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, here's what's interesting.

2226
02:52:48,187 --> 02:52:54,070
[SPEAKER_06]: For those of you guys that are assuming that because Red Octane's putting it out means it's going to be like in the groove, you'd be wrong.

2227
02:52:54,390 --> 02:52:57,572
[SPEAKER_06]: Because Harmonix is actually the folks that's developing me into this game.

2228
02:52:57,872 --> 02:53:05,457
[SPEAKER_06]: Harmonix did, I almost said in the groove, a frequency and amplitude and they helped with Karaoke Revolution and

2229
02:53:06,377 --> 02:53:07,238
[SPEAKER_06]: And what else did they do?

2230
02:53:07,258 --> 02:53:08,998
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's another big one I'm not thinking of.

2231
02:53:09,298 --> 02:53:14,880
[SPEAKER_06]: But Harmonix, you know, they've put out... Frequency and Apple II especially were games that kind of were underrated.

2232
02:53:15,340 --> 02:53:17,421
[SPEAKER_06]: So it'll be very interesting to see what they come up with for this.

2233
02:53:17,661 --> 02:53:25,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Plus, they must have their own studio or something, because they get these great original stuff, and then Karaoke Revolution had a lot of stuff as well.

2234
02:53:25,604 --> 02:53:27,964
[SPEAKER_06]: They redid cover songs, but it was all pretty good.

2235
02:53:28,425 --> 02:53:29,205
[SPEAKER_06]: So it should be interesting.

2236
02:53:29,805 --> 02:53:37,750
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, they had a website at GuitarHeroGame.com, but it got taken down as soon as the website, you know, DDR Freak put out a press release on this, too.

2237
02:53:37,810 --> 02:53:44,375
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe it was either Games Are Fun or somebody had said it first.

2238
02:53:45,335 --> 02:53:47,957
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it was Games Are Fun originally put the story out there.

2239
02:53:48,798 --> 02:53:48,978
[SPEAKER_06]: So...

2240
02:53:50,089 --> 02:53:51,150
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody got a hold of this.

2241
02:53:51,750 --> 02:53:52,991
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the other interesting thing.

2242
02:53:53,031 --> 02:53:55,653
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, this goes back to way in the beginning of the show.

2243
02:53:55,713 --> 02:53:58,796
[SPEAKER_06]: You were talking about some guy was giving you their card and talking about Red Octane.

2244
02:53:59,136 --> 02:54:07,342
[SPEAKER_06]: They also have a site called BAGuitarHero.com, which also got taken down, but they're actually having a contest to get bands in the game.

2245
02:54:07,822 --> 02:54:08,743
[SPEAKER_06]: Uh-huh.

2246
02:54:08,943 --> 02:54:14,467
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe the guy you were talking to was one of these folks trying to get their music in the new Guitar Hero game.

2247
02:54:14,748 --> 02:54:16,309
[SPEAKER_06]: I still think he was macking on me.

2248
02:54:16,629 --> 02:54:17,610
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe, but you never know.

2249
02:54:17,790 --> 02:54:18,090
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.

2250
02:54:18,230 --> 02:54:18,490
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2251
02:54:20,536 --> 02:54:21,917
[SPEAKER_06]: What is this game going to include?

2252
02:54:21,977 --> 02:54:30,642
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the site indicated before it got taken down that it would have songs made famous by Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and White Zombie.

2253
02:54:30,943 --> 02:54:35,546
[SPEAKER_06]: Of course, when they say the term made famous by, you can pick up that it's going to be covers.

2254
02:54:36,126 --> 02:54:39,348
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, Karaoke Revolution, the covers weren't.

2255
02:54:39,926 --> 02:54:40,927
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, man.

2256
02:54:40,967 --> 02:54:41,788
[SPEAKER_06]: White Zombie's pretty awesome.

2257
02:54:41,848 --> 02:54:43,029
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope they have this game playable there.

2258
02:54:57,438 --> 02:54:57,999
[SPEAKER_06]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

2259
02:55:15,270 --> 02:55:19,012
[SPEAKER_06]: Kenchia Hall, by the way, for those that are unfamiliar with E3, they basically have two huge halls.

2260
02:55:19,032 --> 02:55:21,434
[SPEAKER_06]: What is it, West Hall and Main Hall?

2261
02:55:21,494 --> 02:55:21,774
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.

2262
02:55:21,814 --> 02:55:22,554
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Hall, West.

2263
02:55:22,714 --> 02:55:23,235
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Hall, West Hall.

2264
02:55:23,435 --> 02:55:27,778
[SPEAKER_06]: Main Hall is where Xbox was last year and all the other big developers.

2265
02:55:28,998 --> 02:55:31,440
[SPEAKER_06]: Places like Electronic Arts.

2266
02:55:33,801 --> 02:55:34,742
[SPEAKER_06]: Who else is in there?

2267
02:55:35,162 --> 02:55:35,843
[SPEAKER_06]: Engage.

2268
02:55:36,043 --> 02:55:37,444
[SPEAKER_06]: Engage.

2269
02:55:37,464 --> 02:55:38,024
[SPEAKER_06]: Konami.

2270
02:55:38,485 --> 02:55:39,185
[SPEAKER_17]: And the U.S.

2271
02:55:39,305 --> 02:55:39,546
[SPEAKER_17]: Army.

2272
02:55:39,726 --> 02:55:41,327
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all those folks were in the Bain Hall.

2273
02:55:41,907 --> 02:55:47,051
[SPEAKER_06]: The West Hall is another huge hall, and that's where Nintendo and Sony were last year, and where presumably these guys are going to be again.

2274
02:55:47,832 --> 02:55:55,017
[SPEAKER_06]: And then some other, like, you know, not quite as big, but pretty big stuff, like 1up.com, I think, was in there, and Tech TV, when they were still around, had a booth in there.

2275
02:55:55,057 --> 02:56:00,281
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of the folks that put out the plug your joystick into the TV thing, they were all in there.

2276
02:56:00,301 --> 02:56:02,263
[SPEAKER_17]: Sega and Acclaim into little side rooms.

2277
02:56:02,443 --> 02:56:07,287
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's little side rooms, and that's where Sega, Acclaim, Atari, where they all were, like rooms along the way.

2278
02:56:07,848 --> 02:56:12,292
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you have this place called Kensha Hall, and if you don't know where it is, you'll miss it.

2279
02:56:12,732 --> 02:56:14,013
[SPEAKER_06]: It's underneath the main hall.

2280
02:56:14,053 --> 02:56:15,575
[SPEAKER_06]: You go downstairs, and there's this other place.

2281
02:56:15,895 --> 02:56:17,677
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where they kind of stuck all the Korean games.

2282
02:56:18,736 --> 02:56:20,116
[SPEAKER_06]: There was like Korean Alley.

2283
02:56:20,256 --> 02:56:23,317
[SPEAKER_06]: And peripherals and stuff, and that's where some of the cool stuff was.

2284
02:56:23,377 --> 02:56:31,740
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, what's interesting about Kenshiya Hall is that even though people joke about it and say it's a place where games go to die, it's one of the more interesting places at E3, it's really your hidden gems area.

2285
02:56:32,440 --> 02:56:37,741

02:56:45,291 --> 02:56:46,633
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe Red Octane.

2289
02:56:46,793 --> 02:56:51,860
[SPEAKER_06]: The competing company, the guy that I talked to from some other company and I don't remember who it was.

2290
02:56:51,880 --> 02:56:53,502
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, whatever happened with the speakers.

2291
02:56:53,842 --> 02:56:57,867
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, and then there was the guy who said they would send us the speakers to review on the show and we didn't get any.

02:59:49,575 --> 02:59:54,938
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, if I had known I made ones, you should... My Myspace name is LokiOLR.

2354
02:59:54,999 --> 02:59:56,460
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you put your picture on there?

2355
02:59:57,560 --> 02:59:57,881
[SPEAKER_06]: No.

2356
02:59:57,901 --> 02:59:58,601
[SPEAKER_06]: See, that's why.

2357
02:59:58,781 --> 03:00:01,983
[SPEAKER_06]: Put a picture of you looking metrosexual and you'll have women from everywhere.

2358
03:00:02,544 --> 03:00:04,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have any metrosexual pictures.

2359
03:00:05,286 --> 03:00:06,206
[SPEAKER_06]: We can fix that.

2360
03:00:07,407 --> 03:00:11,170
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll get you a little button-up shirt and paint your nails or something.

2361
03:00:12,071 --> 03:00:14,272
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, just wear what Andrew's wearing.

2362
03:00:16,434 --> 03:00:16,734
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.

2363
03:00:18,346 --> 03:00:19,287
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, whatever.

2364
03:00:19,968 --> 03:00:25,072
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyway, look, if you want to be popular, you've got to be metrosexual, because, you know, homos sell.

2365
03:00:25,152 --> 03:00:25,853
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what it is.

2366
03:00:30,857 --> 03:00:32,058
[SPEAKER_06]: And I am homo, so I can say that.

2367
03:00:32,318 --> 03:00:32,698
[SPEAKER_06]: It's okay.

2368
03:00:33,940 --> 03:00:36,822
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, definitely, when we're making gay jokes, you know this show's over.

2369
03:00:36,902 --> 03:00:39,064
[SPEAKER_06]: So please put the nail in the coffin of this show.

2370
03:00:39,104 --> 03:00:41,806
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thought.

2371
03:00:41,846 --> 03:00:43,768
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll start it off with Toadie, your final thought.

2372
03:00:45,333 --> 03:00:47,554
[SPEAKER_06]: What exactly is this my final thought on?

2373
03:00:47,714 --> 03:00:49,154
[SPEAKER_06]: Just, you know, whatever you want.

2374
03:00:49,314 --> 03:00:50,615
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like Jerry Springer.

2375
03:00:50,635 --> 03:00:52,475
[SPEAKER_06]: At the end of every show, he would give you his final thoughts.

2376
03:00:52,555 --> 03:00:53,215
[SPEAKER_06]: What's your final thought?

2377
03:00:53,355 --> 03:00:57,297
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, I'm eagerly anticipating the ITG home version.

2378
03:00:58,317 --> 03:01:03,819
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope that Konami doesn't fuck up the new Extreme 2 like they fucked up the other one.

2379
03:01:04,239 --> 03:01:06,900
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm pretty sure that's already been covered on previous shows.

2380
03:01:08,860 --> 03:01:12,301
[SPEAKER_07]: And... Yeah, I think that's it.

2381
03:01:13,422 --> 03:01:13,802
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm good.

2382
03:01:14,162 --> 03:01:14,542
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.

2383
03:01:15,263 --> 03:01:16,203
[SPEAKER_07]: Loki, your final thought.

2384
03:01:18,644 --> 03:01:20,304
[SPEAKER_05]: Work, work, work.

2385
03:01:20,924 --> 03:01:23,945
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm hoping to play more Final Fantasy XI this week.

2386
03:01:24,125 --> 03:01:25,965
[SPEAKER_05]: God damn it, I need to get back in my routine.

2387
03:01:26,525 --> 03:01:29,166
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just, you know, the woman wants attention.

2388
03:01:29,746 --> 03:01:30,706
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how that is.

2389
03:01:31,146 --> 03:01:33,046
[SPEAKER_05]: And, I don't know.

2390
03:01:33,126 --> 03:01:38,527
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just like, I had to play last night from like, you know, 10 to 2 a.m.

2391
03:01:38,607 --> 03:01:39,608
[SPEAKER_05]: And I started getting tired.

2392
03:01:39,628 --> 03:01:41,988
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what else is really awesome?

2393
03:01:42,575 --> 03:01:43,376

2395
03:01:51,301 --> 03:01:51,801
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you know.

2396
03:01:51,821 --> 03:01:53,622
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty fucking cool.

2397

[SPEAKER_06]: And you know what my final thought is?

2398

2407
03:02:14,008 --> 03:02:18,611
[SPEAKER_17]: Last night, Dan and I, on our main machine, beat Metal Slug X. That game is fucking hard.

2408
03:02:19,551 --> 03:02:20,072

2409
03:02:20,952 --> 03:02:22,553
[SPEAKER_17]: Metal Slug X was pretty damn awesome, though.
