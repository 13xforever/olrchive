1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,000
I'm on my own, drink like a chocolat

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:14,000
Call a party, follow in the heart

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Down to green

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm on a plane, I'll be by my feet

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
It's how I'm wise

6
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
I tell maybe you should

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Take a chance, put me down to death

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
We're looking for a girl who wants more

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Who likes more two girls, two boys

10
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,000
Like they're girls, two girls like that boy

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I should be the one you really are

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I should be in love like you will

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I should be in love like you will

14
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
And I think let's go

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
To a new dimension

16
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
And we have a thing we can choose

17
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Go to one voice, you're like boys

18
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And we go to two boys

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Like bad girls and two girls

20
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Like bad boys

21
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Oh, I should see someone you really like

22
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Go to one voice, you're like boys

23
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You go to two boys like that, go to two girls like that, boy

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Oh, I should be the one you really like

25
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:44,000

B-b-b-cocky.

52
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:08,460
say I'm the happiest bunny on the farm today, but I'm pretty damn happy. You're kind of

53
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:13,980
a... I'm the most carnivorous bunny on the farm. Alright, fair enough. I've been eating

54
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:18,780

57
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:36,940

58
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,240
just saying. I did that stuff yesterday because I don't want to interfere with today, my sleeping

59
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:50,360
and going to fries and whatnot just take a moment to thank the womb where you were cooked so

64
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:12,720
That's what I'm on on like all 70,000 forums I'm on.

00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
All right, Tody.

67
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
How are you?

68
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,720
Okay.

69
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,720
I think I'm getting sick.

70
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,720
Everybody I know is sick.

71
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,720
Get the hell away from me.

72
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,600
I'm a good four feet, so I think we're good.

73
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I know.

74
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,320
We're in the new studio now, though, so it's awesome.

75
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,280
I could reach out and hug everyone right now in this new studio.

76
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,720
You can check out the new webcam over at www.orangeweld.com.

77
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:36,240
Of course, the only person you can see is me right now, but we'll try to get it around.

78
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,960
So say hello to, and there's a reason you're here tonight, and we're going to talk about

79
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:43,360
that when we get into the show.

80
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,640
We like having you here for no reason in particular, but tonight you have a very specific reason

81
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,640
for being here.

82
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:48,640
Okay.

83
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,640
I'll try not to let you down.

84
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,640
All right.

85
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,640
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Bug.

86
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,640
Hello.

87
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,640
And how are you, sir?

88
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,640
I'm doing great.

89
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:58,720
I'm trying to make computers work.

90
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:04,660
Our resident tech geek, Bug, because then when you get Tech Guru, Loki, and Tech Geek

91
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,860
bugged in the same room it's just

92
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,640
i don't know it's assault

93
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,720
and i think we'll collect in twenty at twenty degrees of dork in here right now

94
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,920
anyway i have

95
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,940
all sorts of interesting things we're gonna talk about tonight show

96
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:20,380
i got to check out that in the group premiere party

97
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:23,740
so i'd definitely want to talk about that and of course the reason toady fear

98
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:26,280
you into it too

99
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,780
unfortunately dark soccer and look you are unable to make it so so many people

100
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:31,780
I might have to go to school.

101
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:03,960
of people there that want to say hi to you, www.orangelouder.com. Thanks to the same sources

102
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:09,060
last year, apparently Konami just doesn't learn. We'll see, we'll talk about all that.

103
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,620
If you have a big question mark about that, we're going to talk about that when we come

104
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:15,780
back. Starting this break, I figured since we're going to be talking about Extreme 2

105
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:19,220
at some point tonight, we should play some music from the first DDR Extreme that was

106
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,140
released in the US. So here's some music, and we'll be back after this with more Orange

107
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:30,140
Lounge Radio, see you then!

108
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:55,140
You know the vibration, action, fun

109
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,140
I say hey, hey, hey

110
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:59,140
What you got to say, what you got to say

111
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:02,140
I say one, two, three, four, five

112
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:28,140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

113
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:35,140
It's got to forever, the raindrops blow and the wind is dancing

114
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:42,140
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

115
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:49,140
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own baby

116
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:54,140
Never felt so lonely then you came along

117
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:58,140
So now what should I do?

118
00:13:58,140 --> 00:14:01,140
I'm strong, ow, I need to see you

119
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:05,140
My body aches, now that you're gone

120
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,140
My supplies fell through

121
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:14,140
You let me give me everything you had and more

122
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:17,140
You craved my happiness

123
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:20,140
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

124
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:23,140
But now I feel your stress

125
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:25,140
Love was never meant to be

126
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,140
Such a crazy affair, no

127
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,140
And who has time for tears?

128
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,140
Never thought I'd sit around

129
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:37,140
And unravel your love

130
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:41,140
This is who I am

131
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:13,140
There is so much that we should have done

132
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,140
I was into Cuba

133
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,140
Now I'm strong

134
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:29,140
Driving

135
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:37,140
Knowing it was you I keep on trying

136
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:45,140
Diving into you

137
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:53,140
Diving into you

138
00:15:53,140 --> 00:16:18,140
Looking out a dirty old window Down below the cars in the city go rushing

139
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:26,140
I sit here alone and I wonder why

140
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:29,140
Friday night and everyone

141
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:34,140
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down

142
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:39,140
I search for the beat in this steady town

143
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:42,140
Downtown Leon without going

144
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:45,140
Downtown Leon without going

145
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:51,140
We're the kids in America

146
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:55,140
Everybody lives for the music, alright

147
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:37,840
We're the kids! We're the kids! We're the kids of America!

148
00:17:37,840 --> 00:18:03,560
Hi, we're back with Orange Lounge Radio.

149
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:07,880
that break you heard some Kids in America before that Four Strings with Diving, Heather

150
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:11,280
You're Not Here, originally famous in Silent Hill 3, but then you got to dance to it. And

151
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:17,720
then Funk Boogie, all from DDR Extreme at USA. And of course, as I mentioned earlier,

152
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:23,360
big news, some site mentioned that DDR Extreme 2 is coming out and is going to make a big

153
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:27,920
debut at E3. We'll talk about that a little more later. First, I want to start off, of

154
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:30,520
course, with tonight's show, starting off how we start off every show with a little

155
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,120
bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we talk about our adventures through

156
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:37,720
the week, and you know, any, especially gaming experiences we love to hear about especially

157
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
too.

158
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,920
Starting off with the one and only, Dark Sakura.

159
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:47,960
My week has been interesting, I was, I've basically been in a lot of pain all week,

160
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,960
but most of it doped up on Vicodin, woohoo, and Flexerol, not woohoo for pain, but woohoo

161
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,960
for Vicodin.

162
00:18:53,960 --> 00:19:00,120
Yeah, I've managed to go two days until today without taking any Vicodin, and then I started

163
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:03,720
to hurt really bad again, so I took some more.

164
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,040
But it was all just work, school crap.

165
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:09,280
I was going to go to the end of the group thing, and instead,

166
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,380
so that I can get out of my final, which

167
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:14,680
is the first day of E3, I gave up

168
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,600
going to the end of the group thing

169
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,480
because my education is more important.

170
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,600
Listen to all of this.

171
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:23,880
Your education is more important than video games.

172
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,480
Ignorant people.

173
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,000
Well now, what if you're going to go to one of those schools

174
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,380
that you see in the G4 commercial that you know,

175
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:32,260
learn about how to play games for a living.

176
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,500
Games, games, games, games, games, games.

177
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,260
No comment.

178
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:38,760
OK.

179
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,500
But, um.

180
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,340
You know you want to say something.

181
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,180
I was just going to say, I saw one of those advertisements

182
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,540
the other day for beta testing.

183
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:49,460
They're all, you need to tighten up the graphics

184
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,260
at the end of level three.

185
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:55,380
It made beta testing look extremely fun.

186
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,880
No.

187
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:11,880
Anyway, Thursday though, I went to karaoke for a little bit, and then went to Rapture, which was basically goth industrial, and had a really good time.

188
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,880
I see a little bit of that reflected in your pre-show selections for this evening. It was a little bit angsty.

189
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:16,880
No.

190
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,880
I wouldn't say angsty, but more, it was tragic. Your playlist was tragic.

191
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,880
I had some Britpop in there.

192
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,880
A little bit, but it was tragic Britpop.

193
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,880
How is it tragic?

194
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
I'm just messing with you.

195
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:30,880
I don't see how Pat Shop Boys gets very tragic.

196
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,880
Well, yeah, they do have some kind of angsty stuff.

197
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,880
Because a guy whines when he sings.

198
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:42,880
Anyway, um, I've been in a good mood since then.

199
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:46,880
Except Friday, I heard back from the other guy's insurance company.

200
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,880
Well, that taxi cab company's insurance company.

201
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Tried to call the stupid guy back because he left a message on my voicemail.

202
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:54,880
And this relates to your car accident from a few weeks ago, for those who missed it.

203
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:59,880
And he never called me back. He apparently never came back to his desk.

204
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:04,880
And I need the money, so if they flat out refuse to pay me, I'm suing them.

205
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,880
I've already talked about getting an accident attorney.

206
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,880
And you know me, I will rip them.

207
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,880
Coming soon to CORT TV.

208
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,880
Seriously. But no, I'm going to give them...

209
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:16,880
Take them on Judge Judy.

210
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,880
No.

211
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:21,880
See, I have this thing called a sense of pride.

212
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,880
Okay, how about Texas Justice?

213
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,880
Don't even go there.

214
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,880
Have you ever watched Texas Justice?

215
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:35,880
Is that where the loser gets hanged?

216
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,880
I think they play it just before cops.

217
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:43,880
And you can just tell what the target audience is for this power hour.

218
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:47,880
Anyway, sorry.

219
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,880
No. But I'm going to give them a fair opportunity. I'm going to get a copy of the police report.

220
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:57,980
There's no way they really can't pay me because he was fully at fault, you know, pulled out

221
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,940
in front of me when I had the right of way.

222
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:05,780
I wasn't on my cell phone and my headlights were on so there's nothing they can do.

223
00:22:05,780 --> 00:22:09,980
But it doesn't help my hip and my back to feel any better.

224
00:22:09,980 --> 00:22:13,180
You know, when you go to court, are you going to wear one of those giant, like, poofy neck

225
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:14,180
brace things?

226
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:15,180
No.

227
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,820
That when people are injured in accidents- I'll wear a hip harness.

228
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:21,580
Like whenever you see people on TV that were injured in a car accident, they always have

229
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:24,320
the neck harness it doesn't matter what they broke they could have broke their

230
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:26,840
ankle and they've got a giant neck harness you know I actually have one of

231
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:30,700
those but as from when I fell down you know a foot wall and landed on my back

232
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:37,520
ouch yeah they didn't give me Vicodin then they gave me codeine as I'd like I

233
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:44,920
was drunk for days but um but I had a lot of fun yesterday I completely went

234
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,080
off my diet and had fish and chips and then I had ice cream and then went to

235
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,920
hot topic I'm sorry instagoth to do some shopping

236
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:59,800
here's it's pretty good cider that's what was that stuff called that Apple

237
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:08,240
cider that was blackthorn dry cider that stuff was good and had Guinness too it's

238
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,400
like it doesn't matter what kind of day I have you put Guinness in front of me

239
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,760
and I'm instantly happy but that cider was good I'm gonna need to hunt some of

240
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,320
that down for home.

241
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:18,360
All right.

242
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:21,480
And today, I did my homework.

243
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,280
For my technical writing class, I have to write a tutorial.

244
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:26,360
And actually, the whole tutorial is not due for two weeks.

245
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,200
I have to review somebody else's tutorial,

246
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,840
but I'm just going to do everything at once.

247
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,840
But my tutorial is on how to make live journal

248
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,640
icons using PaintShop Pro 8.

249
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:37,800
Are you going to post that on the interweb for anybody

250
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,800
to see when it's done?

251
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:39,760
Sure, why not?

252
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,600
I'll have that.

253
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,140
I'm hopefully going to have it finished by the end of the week

254
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:48,220
up on the web. You can see my homework. And tomorrow I get to paint. I was supposed to

255
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:54,100
do it today, but eh. I went to bed at 4 a.m., sorry, 4.30 in the morning, and got up at

256
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:58,300
half past noon. So yeah. Sky done.

257
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:03,420
Alright. Let's move on to Loki. Loki, sir, how was your week? How was your day? Put down

258
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,620
the luminous. Hey, okay, okay. I'm getting further now that I actually have time to play.

259
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:16,620
No, my day was okay. I went to Fry's to buy a bunch of supplies for my printer, and we'll get into that stuff later.

260
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:22,620
Fry's rocks, but I mean, I try not to go there too much because I spend too much money.

261
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:31,620
And then I went to a movie this week. I went and saw Kingdom of Heaven, and that was Kingdom of Boring.

262
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:34,620
It looked like Kingdom of Boring from the trailer. I can't believe you actually went.

263
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:39,620
This was father-son time, so, you know, it went because he wanted to see the movie, so...

264
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:43,620
Did it have any true historical reference to it?

265
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:47,620
It did, um, apparently the fighting, everything but the fighting was accurate.

266
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:49,620
Okay, I have to see it.

267
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:55,620
Um, but, really, it's just like, it was like, I've never actually sat through a movie where I said,

268
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:02,620
Okay, is it over yet? Because it just kept going, and I really wanted to end, the battles were anticlimactic.

269
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:09,860
And I can sense that Ridley Scott was trying to make it climactic, but it was just a, look,

270
00:25:09,860 --> 00:25:14,300
I'm filming a scene, but I'm shaking the camera a lot to make it look like something's happening,

271
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
you know?

272
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,300
It's just, no thanks.

273
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:22,700
If I wanted to watch that, you know, I'll go have someone shoot an amateur film of like

274
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:27,700
a Civil War reenactment or something like that, you know, it's just, really, I mean,

275
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,700
steadier shots.

276
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:31,500
It doesn't make like anything else that's happening, you know?

277
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,540
My friend won free passes to see the Kingdom of Heaven.

278
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:38,340
She actually entered an amateur strip contest, and that was part of the prize that she won.

279
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,340
Go figure.

280
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:40,340
Poor bastard.

281
00:25:40,340 --> 00:25:41,740
Is that punishment or something?

282
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,740
I don't know.

283
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:45,420
It was like, you should know better than taking your clothes off in public.

284
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,660
You have to go see Kingdom of Heaven.

285
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,920
I think I want to see it though, just because I'm a big history nut.

286
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,020
She had those advanced screening passes, and she was like, I don't want to go.

287
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:57,400
So she tried to give them to me, and I was like, I don't want to go.

288
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,420
So she ended up leaving them on the table at the bar, and nobody took it the whole night.

289
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:03,420
It's kinda sad.

290
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,420
No, it's not sad.

291
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,420
The movie looked like crap.

292
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:09,420
Anyways, um, so then

293
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:11,420
this week I've been just doing more

294
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:13,420
work and stuff, lots of

295
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:15,420
sales crap. Apparently now they're gonna

296
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:17,420
be sending, they're gonna try to send

297
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,420
my other two co-workers to E3.

298
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,420
So they get

299
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,420
paid to go, and I don't.

300
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,420
Oh, that's fair.

301
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,420
I think they're gonna comp me in some

302
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,420
way if that's the case. And they're only gonna go for a day.

303
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:34,420
And when I say go to E3, I mean go to the meetings at E3.

304
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:37,420
Ooh, that's the fun part, you know, sitting in meetings.

305
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:41,420
You know, I would actually be interested in going to that sometime, just, you know, to see what it's all about.

306
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,420
I heard it's so boring.

307
00:26:42,420 --> 00:26:43,420
Oh.

308
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:45,420
But anyways, anyways.

309
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:48,420
So then, what else?

310
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Oh, I got a free game, another one, Area 51, and I have not played it.

311
00:26:54,420 --> 00:27:01,420
...contemplating selling. Yes, Area 51's been remade again, but this time it's not a shooting game, it's a first-person shooter.

312
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:06,420
Oh, just what we need, another first-person shooting game. I'm so happy.

313
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:12,420
Oh, honestly, yeah. There's, like, so many goddamn first-person shooters out there, it's not even funny, but whatever.

314
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:17,420
So, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing, and just, you know, cleaning house and stuff.

315
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,420
Fun stuff. Oh, I got to play Final Fantasy online the other day.

316
00:27:21,420 --> 00:27:29,580
day so it's finally finally been like having withdrawals very cool all right

317
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:36,580
addict my weekend my day was okay I was kind of busy this weekend because a

318
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:40,460
friend of mine was in town you know it's funny because we went to GameStop the

319
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:45,020
other night and he had like $100 worth of credit that he could turn in to buy

320
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:48,460
stuff he just had it lying around I don't I don't know how you just happen

321
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:50,500
to have $100 worth of credit just lying around.

322
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,300
Oh, look here.

323
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,100
But no, he didn't.

324
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:54,980
And he decided he wanted to get a PSP.

325
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,860
And I was like, if you're going to get a PSP,

326
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:58,180
you have to buy Luminous.

327
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,600
But I think he was kind of starting

328
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,140
to realize that when you get a PSP,

329
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,260
not only do you have to start buying the PSP,

330
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,460
then you've got to buy a memory stick,

331
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:05,500
then you've got to buy a game.

332
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,180
And it really starts to add up pretty quickly.

333
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:09,740
You're not going to throw down $250 when you first get a PSP.

334
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:12,740
You're going to end up throwing down more like $300 or $350.

335
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,260
So he decided he wanted to get Darkstalkers.

336
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:18,500
And lucky him, he actually found a used PSP.

337
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:21,140
Somebody had just traded it in that morning, so he ended up

338
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:21,780
getting one of those.

339
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,740
So lucky him.

340
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,180
And it appeared to be in great shape.

341
00:28:25,180 --> 00:28:28,980
And it already had a memory stick in it that was like 200

342
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,740
something megs, so it was kind of nice.

343
00:28:30,740 --> 00:28:31,180
That's not bad.

344
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,620
You know the 1 gigs are supposed to be out at GameStop.

345
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:35,700
It was like about the best one you can get.

346
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,860
So he got a really sweet deal on that.

347
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,020
But anyway, the point is that I was like, you

348
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:41,140
have to play Luminous.

349
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:42,500
But he was like, I don't really have the money.

350
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:43,340
So I'm like, OK, you know what?

351
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,420
I'm going to get a PSP eventually.

352
00:28:44,420 --> 00:28:48,040
I'm just going to buy Luminous. So now I have a copy of Luminous with no system to play

353
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:54,280
it on because he took it home with him. So, oh well. I figure I'll get a PSP eventually.

354
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:57,480
I just have to wait for the E3 stuff to settle down. So we'll see what happens. Otherwise,

355
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:03,800
my week was just really busy with work. I'm looking forward to next week and E3 and everything

356
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:07,920
just so I can take my mind off my real job. Not that I dislike my real job because I love

357
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:11,680
my job, but I'm looking forward to playing with this job for a little while. It'll be

358
00:29:11,680 --> 00:29:16,120
fun. And that's it. I'll talk about the rest of my week in a little bit. Let's talk to

359
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,320
Tody. What's up with your week in your day? Well, let's see. First of all, I was driving

360
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,880
around about half the day without my wallet. That was really fun because I didn't know

361
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:28,840
where the hell I left that. I thought it might have been in some Mexican restaurant in like

362
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:35,800
West Sacramento. So that kind of freaked me out. Oh, that place is good. Yeah. I didn't

363
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,480
really do anything for Mother's Day. I just kind of, like I said, got some Mexican food.

364
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,640
Only thing I've really been doing lately I actually started playing DDR again. I kind of quit like three months ago

365
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,700
Started playing in the groove, and I've been looking for a new job too because I quit my old in which I've had for like

366
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:54,220
four years

367
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:56,740
Because I used to be like a computer technician there

368
00:29:56,740 --> 00:30:04,000
And then my new boss decided to switch the focus of my job from preparing computers to teaching science classes to children

369
00:30:04,540 --> 00:30:07,680
So I was like hell with that. Yeah, and you love children, right?

370
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:11,680
Roseville Golf Land teaches you how to be a real good babysitter.

371
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:16,680
Oh yes, yes. I actually have a group of little kids down there that want to kick my ass.

372
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,680
It's really funny.

373
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:21,680
Children are fine with the proper preparation and sauces.

374
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:23,680
Yes.

375
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
Get some basil going on there.

376
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Wait, wait, wait. You have kids?

377
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:32,680
I say kids. I think they're like 17 or 18, but they're like 5 feet tall.

378
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:33,680
Okay, okay.

379
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,680
I don't really know.

380
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,680
And they want to kick your ass?

381
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,680
Yes.

382
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:37,680
or something?

383
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,680
No.

384
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:39,680
Oh.

385
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:44,320
I don't know if it's because, like, the Sacramento area is, like, so anti-bar rape or not, and

386
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:48,880
you know, and I'm, like, the biggest bar rapist in the entire area, but it...

387
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:50,680
Big enough to be on a registry?

388
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:51,680
I think so.

389
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,120
I think I could get on, like, maybe as law for bar rapists.

390
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:58,860
Bugs, I know you're not too familiar with the DDR lingo, but when he says bar rapist,

391
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,040
he doesn't mean that he, like, goes into bars and rapes people.

392
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,040
Yeah.

393
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,040
He's talking about DDR.

394
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,040
Yeah.

395
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,040
Like, you hold onto the bar.

396
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:16,040
Ah, look. At least not that you know about anyway. Keep it that way. But that's about it for me.

397
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:19,040
Alright. Bugged. How was your week? How was your day?

398
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:23,040
I got to deal with Pepsi corporate office on Wednesday.

399
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,040
Very nice.

400
00:31:24,040 --> 00:31:28,040
Yeah, they came out for a physical inventory. My boss never showed. The owner of the company never showed.

401
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:35,040
They were more pissed that they didn't show them. We were like 400 cases off, which is 0.0015% deviance.

402
00:31:36,040 --> 00:31:39,040
400 cases? How many sodas are in a case?

403
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:41,040
There's 12 cans per case.

404
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,040
Oh, that's not too bad, I guess. But still, wow.

405
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,040
Out of 272,000, 400 ain't crap.

406
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:53,040
But we ended up going up to Yuba City, In-N-Out, and the Rusty Duck. That is good food.

407
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,040
What the hell is the Rusty Duck?

408
00:31:55,040 --> 00:32:01,480
kind of like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos. Or, well, it seems like a hunting lodge for

409
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,240
rich weirdos, but it's got really good food.

410
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:07,400
Wow. Okay.

411
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:12,720
And that was pretty much it. I wore my fugitive t-shirt yesterday or Friday, whatever the

412
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,960
hell that day was, to give my boss the bad news that says fugitive, you never saw me.

413
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:21,960
So dropped the paperwork off and ran the fuck home.

414
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:26,960
amazing what kind of what would affect shirts can have on people's reactions to

415
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,760
you I didn't tell him what it was all about it here's the paperwork and walked

416
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:35,000
right on out and took off for home I'm thinking of a completely different

417
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,660
circumstance but I'm kind of glad you got me think about this because I want

418
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:41,920
to bring this up at some point I actually changed my picture on myspace

419
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:48,260
lately to one of the pictures from the life is 65 Awards and I didn't post the

420
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:51,880
life is 65 Awards on orange laundry calm I really need to do that I post them on

421
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,380
my own journal so anybody that knows about that can know where to find that

422
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:59,620
but I changed one of my pictures on Myspace to actually one of the pictures

423
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:02,680
of the live 365 awards where I'm wearing one of those shirts that says tough guys

424
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:06,500
wear pink and this one you know it's this typical hot topic shirt and um I

425
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:09,400
swear to God like the day after I changed my picture the next day I logged

426
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:13,900
on and like 15 girls had all sent me a friend request and none of them were

427
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:23,300
over 18. Lucky bastard. You like him young, huh? Damn right. If I wanted to be like a,

428
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:28,780
you know, pedophilia act or whatever they call them, child molester, MySpace would be

429
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:34,660
heaven. It's great. Honestly, seriously, so if that's what you're into as underage girls,

430
00:33:34,660 --> 00:33:40,100
just dress metrosexual and sign up for a MySpace. I got it covered. How many friend

431
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:42,900
requests, you've got the metrosexual thing down, how many friend requests from little

432
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,900
What girls do you get on MySpace?

433
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:46,900
Well, see, everybody lies about their age, so you can't tell.

434
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:51,900
So if they're 19, 16, you just take off three years every single time.

435
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:52,900
About three years is the rule?

436
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:53,900
Yeah.

437
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,900
All right.

438
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,900
I don't lie on my age, but...

439
00:33:57,900 --> 00:33:58,900
I don't either, but...

440
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,900
I mean, I just think it's funny, but I actually accepted all their frame requests,

441
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,900
because then they all leave me comments going,

442
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:05,900
oh, thanks for adding me, ah.

443
00:34:05,900 --> 00:34:08,900
And I'm like, oh, that makes my ego feel good.

444
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,900
Yeah, I'm a MySpace friends whore.

445
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,900
I'll just add random people.

446
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:15,300
I don't know who they are. I don't really care either. I'm not actually on there to

447
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,700
meet people, you know?

448
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:21,820
My sister on MySpace has a thousand friends. One thousand friends.

449
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:22,820
Damn.

450
00:34:22,820 --> 00:34:25,340
I'm like, how do you know that many people?

451
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,340
Yeah.

452
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,580
Like, I doubt I could think of a thousand people. So obviously she just randomly adds

453
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,580
people.

454
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,580
Yeah.

455
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,580
She has a lot of bands, too.

456
00:34:32,580 --> 00:34:33,580
Oh, okay.

457
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:34,580
But you know what's cool about MySpace is that you can have bands on your friends page

458
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:38,260
so you can be all like, yeah, I'm friends with Garbage because Garbage has a MySpace

459
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
and...

460
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
Oh, yes.

461
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,260
Freeze Pop has a thing on MySpace.

462
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:43,260
Mr. T on mine.

463
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:15,260
fights or something. Nice. And the other one's like a skateboarding video and then some death rock song.

464
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:19,260
MySpace is where the internet goes to die. It really is, but

465
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:23,260
sometimes you just want to feel

466
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:27,260
cheap. Yeah. I don't know what the allure of MySpace is, because really... Everybody has

467
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:31,260
one. It's an ugly site. There's no point to MySpace,

468
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:35,260
really, but yet I feel strangely attracted

469
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:39,260
to it. It's like the Fox Network. I don't... That was low.

470
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,260
I don't know how to explain it.

471
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,260
Speaking of Fox Network, family guy in an hour?

472
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:48,260
Don't tell people that, because then they'll turn this show off to go listen to it.

473
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:49,260
That's why there's TiVo.

474
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,260
That's why, yeah, that's why you have TiVo and why you have BitTorrent.

475
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:57,260
Just out of curiosity, does your sister have this really suggestive picture or anything up there?

476
00:35:57,260 --> 00:36:00,260
She used to, I think, but I don't think she does now.

477
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:01,260
Okay, could you write down her-

478
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
Dude, you even have my sister?

479
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,260
Yeah, could you write-

480
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
Dude!

481
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:05,260
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

482
00:36:05,260 --> 00:36:06,260
Not cold.

483
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:08,260
I don't know if my girlfriend's listening or not.

484
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:12,260
My bad.

485
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:17,260
Anyway, so, MySpace, yeah. End of story. Enough said.

486
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:20,260
Notice how Orange Lounge does not have a community on MySpace.

487
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:23,260
We have a community on just about every other website out there, but we do not have one on MySpace.

488
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:26,260
Although, I think Jamie had hinted about starting one.

489
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:29,260
I'm planning on doing it, since I actually have some free time to do that.

490
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:32,260
Now, I'm surprised that you're on MySpace, aren't you?

491
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
I joined it for some Gorillaz thing.

492
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:37,260
Yeah, but have you actually looked at some of the other people's profiles on there?

493
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,260
Let me send you my sister's page.

494
00:36:39,260 --> 00:36:43,260
But, you know what, I barely look at it only when I remember to.

495
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:47,260
Do you remember when everybody had a GeoCities page?

496
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Oh!

497
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,260
I still have a GeoCities page.

498
00:36:50,260 --> 00:36:53,260
They finally deleted mine three months ago.

499
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:57,260
GeoCities, when everybody, you know, the rest of us that had real websites

500
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,260
always called it GeoShitties.

501
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:04,260
But GeoCities, man, hosted some ugly ass websites.

502
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:12,260
I mean, seriously. And it would be like, you know, page dedicated to Britney Spears and it has like the MIDI file embedded in the page.

503
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:25,260
No, let's see. Hey, you guys should see if my page is still up. It's www.geocities.com slash, um, nightmare underscore hunter. And then, uh, see if that-

504
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,260
Do you have MIDI files embedded in your page?

505
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:31,260
No, but I had a page dedicated to stupid people and how I hated them.

506
00:37:31,260 --> 00:37:33,260
Oh, now I have to look.

507
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:42,100
I had stories. Geocities.com. My friend on the East Coast just recently made a page dedicated

508
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:47,780
to her new car. This is Geocities for you. She actually made the font color match her

509
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:53,780
car. Anyway, so it's Nightmare underscore Hunter? Yeah. Let me see if I can find it.

510
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:58,100
I know this is great radio. I don't even know if it's still up anymore. I used to have a

511
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:06,380
Lemmings page too. Yep, there it is. Oh my god, it's really there. Wow. Oh, this is great.

512
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:12,580
Last update. September 26th, 01. Added DDR page. Let's see what links he has on the DDR

513
00:38:12,580 --> 00:38:19,300
page. I had sim files at the time. You have a Club Tropicana DWI. And a Quake 2 theme,

514
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:24,300
DWI. And then this is great, and you see this shit on GeoCities pages all the time. Links

515
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:32,340
to BMS files. Nothing under it. That's because I erased them. Where's the stupid people page?

516
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:37,140
Encounters with stupid people. Let's see. Warning, the following are actual encounters

517
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:44,780
with actual stupid people. August 25th, Saturday. Location, Roosevelt Galleria Electronics

518
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:50,720
Boutique. Case name, stupid clerk. It was Saturday in the late afternoon. I'd never

519
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:53,400
been to the Galleria before, so I thought, what the hell?

520
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:57,420
I was looking for a Dex drive for my PlayStation so that I could upload my PlayStation saves

521
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,560
to this site.

522
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,520
Anyways, I found this third-party device called the MP Exchanger.

523
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:05,880
So I walk up to the counter to pay, and I was greeted with stupidity.

524
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:08,640
Here's an approximate dialogue of the conversation.

525
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,320
Clerk, so you find everything all right?

526
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Looks down at my purchase.

527
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:13,520
Me, yeah.

528
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:16,160
Clerk, man, I was waiting for this thing to sell.

529
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:18,440
I have no idea why anyone would need this for.

530
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,880
I have no idea how it works or if it works.

531
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,480
Me, it copies game saves to your PC off a memory card.

532
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,720
Clerk, OK, would you like to buy insurance

533
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,320
in case you break it within a year?

534
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,760
No.

535
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:32,480
Clerk, giggles, OK, that'll be $5,000.

536
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:38,860
Giggles, me, looks at the cash register display,

537
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:42,160
then hands the more on the correct amount of money, $29.95.

538
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,720
Clerk, hands me the receipt.

539
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,160
Let me know if that thing works.

540
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:52,720
me walking out of the store. WHATEVER. How old were you when you wrote this? 21 probably?

541
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:58,200
Yeah. WHATEVER. I don't think I actually went like that, but you know. Well that's what

542
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:03,280
you put in, WHATEVER. Moral of the story, and by the way, moral is M-O-R-A-L-E. Okay,

543
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:08,080
I was, you know, I don't care. Morale? No wait, no I'm kidding, nevermind, I'm thinking

544
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:12,000
something else. When you see it in all fables, it's always morale of the story. I swear to

545
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:17,440
God, that's what you see. No. I swear, like I had books and that's what it said. Never

546
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:21,880
mind, forget it. Moral of the story, when dealing with the I think I'm funny clerk type,

547
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:26,360
it's best to just ignore any attempt they make to make you laugh. Failure to do so will

548
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:34,000
only prolong the torture. That's wonderful advice. The more you know. Okay, anyway, the

549
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:41,200
other one on there is some stupid guy at Burger King or like McDonald's or something. Well,

550
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:44,760
If you want to check that out, you can visit his old website there. It's fucking great.

551
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,720
Anyway, it sucks. I want to see what other sites you have linked on here. I want to see

552
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:54,400
what the cool sites were to visit back in 2001. Oh, you don't have a links page. Everybody

553
00:40:54,400 --> 00:41:01,760
had a links page. I didn't have a links page. You have a who am I. Your birth date on here,

554
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:10,720
by the way, is listed as 9-11-01. Good job. I didn't want him to know how old I was.

555
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:25,720
Mine is still floating around somewhere on the internet, although Geocities finally deleted it, but I have Dark Sakura's mostly evil shrine.

556
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,720
I saw that years ago.

557
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:28,720
That was me.

558
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:35,720
And then I had a Bust A Move 2 site. I'm actually still up on the anime web turnpike.

559
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:39,720
You know what's funny is all these people in our chat room right now, over at www.orangewormsauce.com,

560
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,120
they're all looking up their GeoCities pages right now, and all I see in the chat right now is this,

561
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:46,620
OMG! My site's still up! OMG! OMG! I can't believe it's still there! OMG!

562
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:52,120
I haven't updated my site in like, four years. I'm surprised that's even up.

563
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:54,220
That's great.

564
00:41:54,220 --> 00:41:55,620
Alright.

565
00:41:55,620 --> 00:42:00,020
Tody, by the way, your girlfriend is in chat and wants to know that your girlfriend's listening.

566
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,120
Uh, yeah, I also just got a text a second ago that said,

567
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,120
Bad Andrew! Yes, I'm listening!

568
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,120
And I'm just like, oh shit!

569
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,120
Uh-oh.

570
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:09,120
Yeah, gotta watch what I say.

571
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:11,120
He didn't mean anything by the underage girl thing.

572
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:12,120
Yeah.

573
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:13,120
It's all underage boys.

574
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:14,120
Yeah.

575
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

576
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,120
Ah!

577
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:20,320
Anyway, Todias, as long as you have the microphone, let's talk about our fabulous party we went

578
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,320
to.

579
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:22,320
Oh, yes.

580
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:23,320
What night was it? Wednesday, Tuesday?

581
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:24,320
Wednesday night.

582
00:42:24,320 --> 00:42:25,320
Wednesday night.

583
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:26,320
Wednesday night.

584
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,320
So how did you get hooked up with this?

585
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,800
We went to our very first video game premiere, and it was for In the Groove, the new dancing

586
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:31,920
game coming out on PlayStation 2.

587
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:35,440
The controversial dancing game, I guess I really should say, because it seems like the

588
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:39,060
dance game community is really divided over this In the Groove game.

589
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:43,920
If you've been living under a rock, In the Groove is this game that was created by, and

590
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:48,200
I think it's fair to say, fans of the DDR series are folks that made this game, but

591
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:53,160
what they wanted to do was kind of improve on what they felt DDR was lacking on.

592
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,640
But it's in no way like DDR.

593
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:57,640
No way at all.

594
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,800
But it's a completely different game, even though it has four arrows that scroll up that

595
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:06,700
dance to in DDR machines mind you the upgrade it's nothing like DDR it's

596
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:11,360
Mario versus that that's the greatest argument I read is that DDR versus in

597
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:18,160
the group it's like Mario versus Sonic oh yeah you don't put a new sticker on

598
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,040
your Nintendo case and suddenly put turn it into something but that's another

599
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:25,800
story forget yeah despite how you feel about the game we got we got to go to

600
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:30,200
this party and I don't you you got hooked up through I got up the itg freak

601
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:38,200
And DDR Freak was kind enough to hook us up with passes because we don't count as a legitimate media source in the industry or something, I don't know what that was.

602
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,200
We haven't really worked with Red Octane in the past, I don't even think they know who we are, so you know, it's cool.

603
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:53,200
Actually, they do know who we are because they offered us a partnership deal a few years ago when I was hosting Shaft.

604
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:55,200
How did I miss that?

605
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,200
I think we tried to do the whole Red Octane thing out of the head.

606
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:02,200
They know about us now for sure. Some of them might be listening even. Hi Red Octane, hi.

607
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:06,200
I swear we're not going to bash this game. Anyway, no.

608
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:10,200
I have things to say about it, but I'll ask Tody first. How was your drive down

609
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,200
and what did you think when you got there and everything? What was it like?

610
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:18,200
Well, we would have been on time, but you know, an hour of traffic, and then when we actually got to San Francisco

611
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:22,200
we were like, oh hey, look, it's the 5th Street Garage. So we ended up going down

612
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,200
10 blocks because there were no left turns on any of them, and down about another

613
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:30,920
streets and another ten blocks back to get to the parking garage. That was a pain in

614
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:35,000
the ass. And then we were, um, I hope this guy's not listening, but there was this creepy

615
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,200
ass guy that just, like, approached me and my guest as we were walking up and just started

616
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:45,280
asking us about, like, music fees and royalties and how much he should charge, like, Red Octane

617
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,260
and stuff like that for his music. And it's like, get away from me. I don't know you.

618
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,280
Please don't touch me. You know what? There might be a reason for

619
00:44:51,280 --> 00:44:55,080
that. It has to do with something else Red Octane mentioned this week. I'll get to that

620
00:44:55,080 --> 00:45:01,080
I was very confused, and he gave me his phone number when he left, which made me even more confused.

621
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,080
Hot.

622
00:45:02,080 --> 00:45:04,080
Great calling! Great calling!

623
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
Wait, you want to call him right now?

624
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,080
I should have brought it.

625
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,080
You want to call him right now on the show?

626
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,080
I wish I brought it with me, you know, but...

627
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:13,080
All right.

628
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:17,080
All right, well, okay, so you got there, and what did you think when you got to the thing?

629
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:24,080
Well, the place was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I think they were honestly expecting a lot more people to show up.

630
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:49,080
I was actually surprised that there weren't as many people as I thought. Don't get me wrong, I kind of liked it that way. It was a really nice vibe there. I didn't really personally know a lot of people there. I did run into a few people in the scene such as yourself and a couple of people from other websites. Believe it or not, even though we're all quote-unquote competing websites, you know, we all sit down and have drinks. It's fun. And good people that run the other websites in the community.

631
00:45:49,080 --> 00:46:00,080
But if you think about it, like, DDR Freak had 10 passes to give away, but Monty Stell had 10 passes to give away, and the Groove Freak had 10 passes to give away, and if they all bring a guest, that's 60 people right there.

632
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:02,080
There was maybe 60 people in the entire place.

633
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:05,080
I know. I kind of was like, wow, Red Octane had a lot of people there.

634
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:06,080
Yeah.

635
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Like, most of the people there were from Red Octane, it seemed, or some type of press or something.

636
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Yeah. Well, if I can rant here for a second.

637
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:12,080
Sure.

638
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:17,800
What I kept seeing was all these 15-year-olds.

639
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:18,800
Why won't they let me in?

640
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:22,040
Why won't they just let us have a past that doesn't let us have alcohol or something like

641
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,040
that?

642
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,820
It's like, well, you're completely missing the point of what this is.

643
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:29,640
The employees want to go down there and just get fucking wasted.

644
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:30,760
We completed a game.

645
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:33,760
We're going to have a party, and they don't want to have to deal with 15-year-olds.

646
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:39,240
I'm sorry to say it, but I talked to a bunch of Red Octane employees there.

647
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,360
You know what?

648
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,920
How do I put this nicely?

649
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,300
Because a lot of people who listen to us are under 18.

650
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:48,680
Don't take this the wrong way, you guys.

651
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:53,480
There are a lot of great, intelligent people your age that would work very well at a party

652
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:57,500
like this and you could have fit in and everybody would have had just a good time, but you have

653
00:46:57,500 --> 00:47:03,280
to realize that there are other people your age fucking it up for the rest of you, seriously.

654
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,680
And they post on DDR Freak, MBomaniStyle, and IDG Freak.

655
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:11,360
So they couldn't just open it up to anybody 18 and under because unfortunately one of

656
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:14,320
the rotten apples would get in there and fuck it all up.

657
00:47:14,320 --> 00:47:20,480
Not to say that everybody over 21 is perfect, but luckily we lucked out, everybody there

658
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,480
was very cool.

659
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:23,480
I didn't run into anybody I just liked.

660
00:47:23,480 --> 00:47:27,360
And trust me, there's people over 21 that are stupid that I'm glad stayed far away from

661
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:28,360
this.

662
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:33,920
But I think there's just a certain maturity level expectation and that's just the way

663
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:34,920
life is.

664
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,380
I'm sorry to say it.

665
00:47:36,380 --> 00:47:42,020
But you know, someday you will have this conversation with other teenagers, so you know, I don't

666
00:47:42,020 --> 00:47:43,020
know what else to say.

667
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,700
Yeah, more than anything else, I mean, there were so many Red Octane and Rockstar employees

668
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,700
there.

669
00:47:47,700 --> 00:47:51,700
I mean, it was basically a party for them, not really for the fans of the game, so...

670
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:55,260
Yeah, that's what I thought was also interesting about this.

671
00:47:55,260 --> 00:47:59,500
The party really wasn't for hardcore In the Groove players.

672
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:02,820
I think that was the number one misconception about this, was that, oh, it was going to

673
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,820
be the best of the best in the group players showing off this game.

674
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:10,340
Whereas in fact, most people were just average.

675
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:14,300
Toady was probably one of the best players there and there was only a handful, I could

676
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,540
probably count them on one hand, how many 10, 11, 12 foot players were at this thing.

677
00:48:19,540 --> 00:48:23,340
I mean when people are looking at me and going, this guy is good, come on.

678
00:48:23,340 --> 00:48:30,140
Oh you got moves, I've seen them, I've seen them.

679
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:36,220
So what I loved about it, though, is that there was an open bar, and the club was very

680
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,220
posh.

681
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:38,220
Yeah.

682
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,220
It was nice.

683
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:40,220
Honestly, these guys know how to throw a party.

684
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:41,220
Oh, I agree.

685
00:48:41,220 --> 00:48:45,260
Despite how you may feel about In the Groove, the party was awesome.

686
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:46,260
That was brilliant.

687
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:47,260
Free sushi.

688
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:48,260
Yeah.

689
00:48:48,260 --> 00:48:49,260
All that stuff.

690
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,260
Oh, my gosh.

691
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:51,260
Drink all night.

692
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:52,260
In the Groove totally knows...

693
00:48:52,260 --> 00:48:53,260
I'm sorry.

694
00:48:53,260 --> 00:48:54,260
Red Octane.

695
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:55,260
Stop rubbing it in.

696
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:56,260
Sorry.

697
00:48:56,260 --> 00:48:57,260
Red Octane totally knows how to buy my love.

698
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,260
Honestly.

699
00:48:58,260 --> 00:48:59,260
Oh, yeah.

700
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,580
If they could buy off my opinion on this game, this would have been a great party to do it.

701
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:04,580
But no, I thought...

702
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:10,260
If they could buy off your opinion on this game and that game would have been Driver

703
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,260
3.

704
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:12,260
Yeah, I would have been giving Driver 3 reviews of the game.

705
00:49:12,260 --> 00:49:16,020
But okay, as far as the feelings for the game myself, okay, so I got to check out the home

706
00:49:16,020 --> 00:49:18,340
version of In the Groove on PlayStation 2.

707
00:49:18,340 --> 00:49:22,420
And as you guys know, I've always been, this is, and when I first reviewed In the Groove,

708
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:27,540
this is what I said about it, it's not as bad as the people who are saying In the Groove

709
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:32,580
should die and go away is saying. It's not that bad. But it's not as good as what the

710
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:38,940
people who are saying, OMG, DDR is dead forever, ITG for life is saying. It's somewhere in

711
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:44,780
the middle. That is how I still feel about this game even after seeing it at the show.

712
00:49:44,780 --> 00:49:51,180
I was actually more impressed. I didn't think the game would translate as well to the PlayStation

713
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:57,020
as it did because you have to consider that, I mean, I don't, a lot of this game was kind

714
00:49:57,020 --> 00:50:02,500
of homebrew, really. It's kind of, StepMania was a homebrew thing and it kind of evolved

715
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:06,160
from that, right? So a lot of this game was homebrew. It actually translates very well

716
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:11,440
and very smoothly into a PlayStation 2 game, so I was pretty impressed with that. As far

717
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,360
as the game itself, though, it's in the groove. You already have an opinion on this game,

718
00:50:15,360 --> 00:50:17,800
honestly. There's nothing I'm going to say that's going to change your mind one way or

719
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,500
other. If you've played In the Groove in the arcade, you like it, you're going to like

720
00:50:21,500 --> 00:50:26,860
the home release. If you don't like it, you're not going to like it. So, I would recommend

721
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:33,860
In the Groove to Dance Game fans. But I still would say, if it's your first game, I don't

722
00:50:34,220 --> 00:50:37,120
know. You may want to weigh your options a little bit. I think DDR has some more beginner

723
00:50:37,120 --> 00:50:41,140
accessible things. I think In the Groove is always going to be more for the hardcore niche

724
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:42,100
player. That's mine.

725
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:46,900
Well actually, the home version actually added a new training slash beginners mode that's

726
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:51,380
not available in the arcade. Right, right. And I did notice that, but I was still...

727
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:54,300
Yeah. I don't know, it's still...

728
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:57,940
I don't know what it is. In the Groove, it just doesn't have that

729
00:50:57,940 --> 00:51:02,140
beginner warm fuzziness to it that DDR does. I can't explain it better than that.

730
00:51:02,140 --> 00:51:05,860
We didn't really grow up, so to speak, on it, I guess. I guess. That might be

731
00:51:05,860 --> 00:51:08,620
something to do with it. But, I mean, as long as they're not making any other

732
00:51:08,620 --> 00:51:11,500
games, and In the Groove is going to continue to challenge me, I'm just...

733
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:14,980
I'm going to play it, you know, in the story. Honestly, the honest way I feel about it is

734
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:17,620
I mean, and I know that might sound a little bit

735
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:20,820
belittling, but it really is kind of a compliment that it

736
00:51:20,820 --> 00:51:23,860
is actually holding my attention for a new DDR.

737
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:28,260
Because it's unfortunate, but Konami has kind of slowed down

738
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:29,620
on the arcade stuff, at least.

739
00:51:29,620 --> 00:51:31,300
But this home version is a whole other world.

740
00:51:31,300 --> 00:51:33,500
We're going to get into later in the show, this is going to

741
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:34,780
be a huge year for a dance game.

742
00:51:34,780 --> 00:51:37,780
That is now four dance games after this week.

743
00:51:37,780 --> 00:51:40,020
We know for sure there are four dance games coming out

744
00:51:40,020 --> 00:51:41,700
this year, and they all want your attention.

745
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,020
But on the other hand, it's going to be a huge year for

746
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:49,020
But honestly, most people who listen to this show aren't going to buy all four anyway, I think. I don't know.

747
00:51:49,020 --> 00:51:50,020
Probably.

748
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,020
Probably.

749
00:51:51,020 --> 00:52:01,020
Well, the biggest compliment, though, that I had at the game, and I really want to credit Red Octane for doing this, is that they kept the timing windows in the game the same as the arcade.

750
00:52:01,020 --> 00:52:02,020
Yeah, that was cool.

751
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:06,500
this is my that is my absolute biggest criticism whatsoever of all the home

752
00:52:06,500 --> 00:52:09,900
versions on for DDR games because you actually you get used to playing on

753
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:14,440
those and you go to the arcade and you just suck you know you're you're

754
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:17,300
terrible you're just off by a couple milliseconds and you start great

755
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,980
attacking everything and you're like what the hell's going on at home I'm

756
00:52:19,980 --> 00:52:24,500
triple laying this so I'm really really glad that they kept that the same it's

757
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:29,340
actually going to be able to improve your ability in the arcade well I'll

758
00:52:29,340 --> 00:52:32,780
tell you one thing I really liked and this was something that really surprised

759
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:36,620
me about the party because I did not think I would be as impressed by this as

760
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:40,780
I was was Red Octane's metal pad. Yes, I was wondering if you're gonna cover the

761
00:52:40,780 --> 00:52:46,860
afterburner. The afterburner is amazing I thought it was it's it's great yeah it's

762
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:50,660
the best metal pad I've played on but of course I haven't played on that many but

763
00:52:50,660 --> 00:52:55,420
it's it's the best it's so responsive it's smooth it's great. Well I own two

764
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:59,940
personalized cobalt fluxes, and I can easily say that I would rather have two

765
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:03,740
afterburners. Do you know the other thing I noticed about the afterburners was just

766
00:53:03,740 --> 00:53:07,080
awesome? The way that they lock together, so you can kind of play doubles with the

767
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:10,460
pads locked together. The only thing the afterburner is missing, seriously, is a

768
00:53:10,460 --> 00:53:15,900
bar. Yes, I was actually talking to a guy named Atma who works for Red Octane, and

769
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:19,600
they actually have development going on for that. I don't know if it'll actually

770
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:23,180
go through or not, but I was offering some suggestions, of course, because it's the

771
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:27,180
Right, right. Now, you can't play these games without the bar, as you found out.

772
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:29,180
It's quite difficult for me.

773
00:53:29,180 --> 00:53:35,180
And that's going to be a problem for this game coming home, but interesting creative solutions. Now, you tried something.

774
00:53:35,180 --> 00:53:38,180
It didn't work too well. I tried.

775
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,180
What did you try to do as a bar replacement at the party?

776
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:46,180
Well, since I didn't really have any chairs there, I basically just grabbed one of these metal bar stools.

777
00:53:46,180 --> 00:53:48,180
The second I brought it over there

778
00:53:48,180 --> 00:53:54,940
I was immediately assaulted by a whole bunch of like bar staff and red octane employees that told me that I couldn't do this

779
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,880
There was you know liabilities and crap like that like I'd fall and crack my face open or something

780
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,420
So that really irritated me

781
00:54:03,660 --> 00:54:05,180
but

782
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:07,180
It was and I was so disappointed to this

783
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:10,740
I don't know if you've checked out orange launch radio.com, but we have picture galleries up on there

784
00:54:10,740 --> 00:54:13,960
I saw my ass on the picture gallery multiple times. Yes

785
00:54:13,960 --> 00:54:21,240
I was in the other room at that moment, but I heard After Burner, not only are they ripping

786
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:23,400
off TDR, now they're ripping off SEGA.

787
00:54:23,400 --> 00:54:26,600
Okay, well, well, well, wait.

788
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:30,640
I think we all know that this is not, that the new After Burner pad has nothing to do

789
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,400
with everybody's favorite jet flying game.

790
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,400
No, I know.

791
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:36,200
I know, but this just makes me want to hook up my 32X.

792
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:37,200
I know you're teasing.

793
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:42,840
But the After Burner pads, honestly, I was more impressed with the After Burner pads

794
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:47,000
anything in the show. Yeah. I thought they were great. Yeah, is that the first metal

795
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:51,160
pad that really has a system of, like, the depressed arrows, like the arcade? I know

796
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:55,700
the Cobalt Flux is completely flat, and I've had, like, a My My box, which was pretty much

797
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:59,560
flat also. I'm going to ask our expert here, because I don't know, really, your pads that

798
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:06,560
you built had it. My pads rock, that's why, because I put my hard, you know, I put a lot

799
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:16,340
hard effort into getting them well built working it's a little different but my

800
00:55:16,340 --> 00:55:22,440
pads rock they weigh a ton but as far as depresseros yeah most of them were like

801
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,680
flat and they're lame like I remember those old metal pads you can get off the

802
00:55:25,680 --> 00:55:29,920
eBay or whatever I remember I bought no metal pads from they end up selling them

803
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,920
as someone they put the first time I stepped on it it bent I'm like why did

804
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:36,920
Did it bend? That's weird.

805
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:38,920
Cause it made tin foil enough.

806
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:41,920
I'm sorry if I sound like I was knocking your metal pads, Loki,

807
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,920
but these pads actually worked for more than 15 minutes.

808
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,920
Cause mine aren't grounded, you dumbass.

809
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:48,920
Shit.

810
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:52,920
Once I put that wire on, man, those fucking pads are gonna rock.

811
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:54,920
Dude, but these pads at the show, you have to...

812
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,920
They were taking abuse. I saw Girls in Heels playing on these pads.

813
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,920
They were taking a lot of abuse, and they were still holding up great.

814
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,920
Stupid women.

815
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:10,920
Stop it. Stop it now. The girls I met were actually very nice. I actually met a lot of people at the show that were just kind of from the scene.

816
00:56:10,920 --> 00:56:20,920
You know, and I've bashed a lot on the In The Groove community, and I kind of apologize to these people that I met the other night because they were actually really great folks.

817
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:24,920
You just have to remember there's a couple bad apples ruining the barrel out there because there are some folks out in the community that are like,

818
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:33,040
DDR is dead. If you still play DDR you're a fag. Stop being such a fag. Stop fagging

819
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:39,020
up the dance scene. So, and that's just, I just can't stand that attitude. Especially

820
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:46,560
when you considered it in the groove. I don't care how you spin it. In the groove is a deviation

821
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:52,780
of the DDR game. You cannot spin this any other way that I will believe you that this

822
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,920
This is not some type of at least inspired by DDR.

823
00:56:55,920 --> 00:56:57,620
You cannot spin it.

824
00:56:57,620 --> 00:56:59,820
Had there been no DDR, there would be no In the Groove.

825
00:56:59,820 --> 00:57:00,820
Absolute.

826
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,820
Period.

827
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,820
End of sentence.

828
00:57:02,820 --> 00:57:03,820
And that sums it up there.

829
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:08,480
So, and these kids out there that are just saying, you know, DDR, have no respect for

830
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,820
where In the Groove came from.

831
00:57:09,820 --> 00:57:12,940
Hello, DDR fans, built In the Groove!

832
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:16,300
I'm done.

833
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:22,300
And they also built stupid, uh, what was it, that Dancing in Stage, um, Unleashed, or whatever.

834
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:29,580
Oh, well, stupid Konami, they can't get anything right as far as, like, you know, the new arcade

835
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,580
games.

836
00:57:30,580 --> 00:57:36,560
I mean, I swear, you know, I don't know, I'm really curious to see what they're gonna come

837
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:40,660
up with for this year's E3, you know.

838
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,860
I-Toy, that was a great idea!

839
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:43,860
Let's do that again!

840
00:57:43,860 --> 00:57:46,860
You know what? I think people were way too harsh on the iToy thing.

841
00:57:46,860 --> 00:57:48,860
Oh yeah, because you know...

842
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:50,860
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on a minute.

843
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,860
I don't want to get too far off topic here. I'm not done within the groove yet.

844
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:55,860
But the iToy thing, look at it this way.

845
00:57:55,860 --> 00:57:59,860
For those of us that are into DDR and all that stuff, it was kind of silly.

846
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:03,860
But let's face it, DDR was not just made for us.

847
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,860
It was also made for 9-year-old girls to have at their slumber parties.

848
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:08,860
Like it or not.

849
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,860
And this is a topic I'm going to bring back later when we start talking about Extreme 2.

850
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,980
too. Nine-year-old girls and their slumber parties think this iToy shit's hilarious.

851
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:20,000
Not that I know firsthand. I've just, you know, heard things and read about them on

852
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:25,540
certain internet websites. iToy was not made for you. It was not made for you, the fan.

853
00:58:25,540 --> 00:58:30,300
It was made to make DDR more accessible and more showy and flashy. And that's why DDR

854
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:35,100
does so well because it's such a showy, flashy game. And that's something that In the Groove,

855
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:39,380
by the way, completely lacks, is showiness and flashiness. In the Groove looks like just

856
00:58:39,380 --> 00:58:45,720
industrial, sad, sad, gothic thing. Not to knock the game quality, because it's a fun

857
00:58:45,720 --> 00:58:46,720
game, but it looks sad.

858
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:47,720
It looks too American.

859
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:50,640
It looks, yeah. Sadly, it looks too American. Anyway.

860
00:58:50,640 --> 00:58:56,760
Well, yeah, because, you know, I love the iToy game where you hit the stupid ball around,

861
00:58:56,760 --> 00:59:01,360
and you spend, like, 15 minutes trying to get the ball to go where you want it to go,

862
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,560
and it sucks, and it's so frustrating.

863
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,480
I'm already pissed off at Sonic Team for not doing a real Knights game, and instead doing

864
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:14,640
nights and that's that I toy collection what yeah I remember that a Sega

865
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:19,160
collection thing that they were doing the I toy with it three uh-huh well

866
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:23,400
there's a night's game in it why couldn't they just make nights I'm

867
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,760
sorry I had to rant oh yeah why couldn't they just freakin make samba on ps2

868
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,240
somebody me go there just needs to be given a whole shitload of money and do

869
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,960
nothing but make games that I tell them to okay and of course we have somebody

870
00:59:35,960 --> 00:59:40,120
in our chat room right now that says SSJ 100 Matt says iToy games equal great

871
00:59:40,120 --> 00:59:44,600
games to play with your penis. You always know somebody's got to be the

872
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:54,500
jokester. Ass! Alright, I don't think that'll work. Back to In the Groove. I know. Back to In the

873
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,080
Groove for a minute, alright, before we get on all these other tangents. Alright,

874
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:02,120
so In the Groove. Do I recommend the game? If you like In the Groove, yes. If

875
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,480
you don't know how you feel about it, at least check it out. Form your own

876
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,880
opinion, don't listen to people on the internet. That is my opinion on In The Groove, don't

877
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:12,440
listen to people on the internet, play the game for yourself and form your own opinion.

878
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:19,120
There it is. Honestly, you know what this is right here? This is the equivalent of like

879
01:00:19,120 --> 01:00:24,760
say, ok, you've got your hair care products and stuff like that, ok, and you've got, you

880
01:00:24,760 --> 01:00:30,360
know, for women they have their conditioner and stuff, and then guys won't buy that crap

881
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:35,180
because they're like, that's gay, I'm not going to put that gay shit in my hair, so

882
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:38,080
and then they come up with something cool, extreme gel!

883
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:40,180
Okay, so you buy this extreme gel.

884
01:00:40,180 --> 01:00:42,260
It's basically the same damn thing as the woman's pride,

885
01:00:42,260 --> 01:00:44,060
but repackaged, so you buy it.

886
01:00:44,060 --> 01:00:45,420
This is what In the Groove is.

887
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:48,540
In the Groove is the Dance Dance Revolution game

888
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,740
that you can play and not feel gay about.

889
01:00:50,740 --> 01:00:52,080
That's what it is.

890
01:00:53,300 --> 01:00:56,020
That is quite possibly the best analogy

891
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:58,420
for this whole damn thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

892
01:00:58,420 --> 01:01:00,060
Congratulations, hats off to you.

893
01:01:01,060 --> 01:01:03,100
People should post that on every forum.

894
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:05,100
That's all it is. That's really what it is.

895
01:01:05,100 --> 01:01:07,100
You better copyright that. You better copyright it.

896
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:10,100
It's the men's suave of the dancing world.

897
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,100
It's P.H. Balance for a guy.

898
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
Exactly! They have that crap now.

899
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,100
P.H. Balance for my ass.

900
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:19,100
If it wasn't P.H. Balance, you know, I'd just put that shit on.

901
01:01:19,100 --> 01:01:21,100
Oh my God, it burns!

902
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:24,100
No, but anyways. Yeah.

903
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:27,100
Toady, your thoughts?

904
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,100
Well, uh, I've already kind of been an ITG fanboy.

905
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:34,740
I mean, the first time I played it, I really thought it was pretty much just gimmicky bullshit,

906
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,740
you know?

907
01:01:35,740 --> 01:01:36,740
I'm like, mines?

908
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:37,740
You know, what the fuck is this?

909
01:01:37,740 --> 01:01:38,740
Who cares, you know?

910
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:41,000
I actually tried to do my first hand plant the other day.

911
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,200
I will never do that again.

912
01:01:42,200 --> 01:01:44,740
I burst a couple veins in my hand.

913
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,060
I threw out my back!

914
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:47,060
Alright!

915
01:01:47,060 --> 01:01:50,720
But, I mean, the more I played it, the more I liked it, and like I said, they're not making

916
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,900
any more DDR, so I'm going to keep playing it.

917
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:56,700
But I mean, I was impressed with the home version, so.

918
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:01,380
They got some stuff from ITG2 on here, so it should be pretty good.

919
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:04,960
They didn't fuck with the timing windows, so I'm happy.

920
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:05,960
I got it pre-ordered.

921
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:06,960
You know what?

922
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:11,100
I'm going to pick it up, because my opinion of In the Groove is, even though I say I'm

923
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:12,380
on the fence, it's favorable.

924
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,260
I think it's only going to be like 30 bucks, so I'm going to pick it up.

925
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:17,700
You know, why not?

926
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:19,780
The DDR games aren't going to be out until fall.

927
01:02:19,780 --> 01:02:21,460
I'm going to pick up these games.

928
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:25,700
I think most people will.

929
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:28,100
I will soon.

930
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,700
I don't know if Red Octane is still doing it, but before, if you pre-ordered, they gave

931
01:02:31,700 --> 01:02:35,300
you a whole bunch of gimmicky shit with it, like t-shirts and keychains.

932
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:38,420
So basically all this stuff we got at the launch party for free.

933
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,260
They gave away for free at the show.

934
01:02:40,260 --> 01:02:43,180
You know what Jason told me today, and I haven't seen this post on the internet, but there's

935
01:02:43,180 --> 01:02:47,220
a rumor on the internet going around that all the people in attendance from the websites,

936
01:02:47,220 --> 01:02:50,580
Us, BimaniStyle, and stuff, DDRFreak, who else was being represented there?

937
01:02:50,580 --> 01:02:55,660
I know Us, BimaniStyle, DDRFreak, ITGFreak, I didn't meet anybody from that site.

938
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:01,660
The rumors going around that we all got advanced copies of In the Groove for the Playstation.

939
01:03:01,660 --> 01:03:04,660
Should we just perpetuate that rumor just to irritate people?

940
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:08,660
No, but if anybody wants to send me a copy of the game, I would love to have it.

941
01:03:08,660 --> 01:03:12,660
If you want to send me an advanced copy, hit me up offline and I'll give you the address.

942
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,660
But that rumor as it stands is completely false.

943
01:03:14,660 --> 01:03:17,660
We got shirts and keychains and other cute little things.

944
01:03:17,660 --> 01:03:18,660
Lots of beer.

945
01:03:18,660 --> 01:03:20,660
And alcohol, which is great.

946
01:03:20,660 --> 01:03:22,660
Like I said, Red Octane knows how to throw a party.

947
01:03:22,660 --> 01:03:25,540
I thought that bar was very cool, and I loved how we took

948
01:03:25,540 --> 01:03:27,420
over the media room at one point towards the end of the

949
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:29,460
evening, and I had a great time, met some good people.

950
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:32,620
And honestly, I think what this did, it made me a little

951
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:35,340
more favorable of the In the Groove community as a whole,

952
01:03:35,340 --> 01:03:38,160
because I know now that there are good people in the

953
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,580
community that aren't ruining it for everybody else, so

954
01:03:40,580 --> 01:03:41,260
that's good.

955
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:48,160
And I think between that and the news that Red Octane came

956
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:51,600
out with later in the week, I'm actually really respecting

957
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:57,660
Red Octane's trying to do. I think Red Octane is trying to play up to the music

958
01:03:57,660 --> 01:04:01,120
fan base and put stuff, music gaming fan base and put stuff out there that people

959
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,600
want. Well, making lots of money. Yeah, I mean, and it is all about money, but I

960
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:08,700
have to admit the whole thing, while it didn't really change my opinion on

961
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,160
In the Groove per se, it really upped my respect for Red Octane and what

962
01:04:12,160 --> 01:04:15,680
they're trying to do. And of course there was a rumor going around the party

963
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,000
that Red Octane was going to do a second music game, which we found out about

964
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:23,640
about later in the week and we'll get into that a little later in the show.

965
01:04:23,640 --> 01:04:26,360
Anyway, for now, I think what we'll do is we'll do a little bit of a break. Oh, actually,

966
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,520
I want to respond to some chatroom comments before we get a break. One thing somebody

967
01:04:30,520 --> 01:04:35,400
said, Kuwabara, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, said, I don't feel gay when I play DDR.

968
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:40,520
Well, you know, okay, and that's true, you shouldn't, because dance games do not have

969
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:44,480
a sexuality. I think Loki's comment, though, you have to remember is more towards what

970
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:50,300
but the general public views these games as we, as you folks who are geeky enough to tune

971
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:55,180
into a music station that is towards these dance games, and you know, us in the community,

972
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,020
we know it's not gay, and we know, we have fun with it, but you have to remember the

973
01:04:58,020 --> 01:05:02,140
average, you know, Joe Q jock guy that comes in an arcade, you know.

974
01:05:02,140 --> 01:05:06,060
Yeah, just yesterday at RVGO, one of my friends had that problem, two little dumbass jocks

975
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:10,540
jumped on the pad, started acting like, you know, little monkeys or whatever, and we're

976
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:14,300
both standing there with like our girlfriends, he's like, you guys are queers, like, gave

977
01:05:14,300 --> 01:05:15,300
Give them a thumbs up.

978
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:16,300
Haha.

979
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:17,300
See you later.

980
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:19,740
Well, you know what I used to do to those people, apart from having them kicked out

981
01:05:19,740 --> 01:05:20,740
of the arcade?

982
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:23,380
Yeah, but they don't exactly call you queer.

983
01:05:23,380 --> 01:05:24,380
I mean...

984
01:05:24,380 --> 01:05:28,260
But, no, but they still, you know, get up and act all asshole-ish on the machine.

985
01:05:28,260 --> 01:05:32,860
So, my favorite circumstance is when I went up to these guys and said, okay, I'll pay.

986
01:05:32,860 --> 01:05:35,860
But I picked the songs.

987
01:05:35,860 --> 01:05:37,060
And what was it that I picked?

988
01:05:37,060 --> 01:05:38,300
It was something fairly vicious.

989
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:39,300
What rhythm and police?

990
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:40,300
Yeah, it was something pretty mean.

991
01:05:40,300 --> 01:05:41,300
Yeah.

992
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,300
It was cool.

993
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,820
And I went, ugh.

994
01:05:44,820 --> 01:05:47,620
Yeah, I won't challenge anybody unless it's for like $40 a game.

995
01:05:47,620 --> 01:05:49,300
I'm like, don't waste my time.

996
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:50,340
But no.

997
01:05:50,340 --> 01:05:52,500
You want to play a five-time tournament winner?

998
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,140
$40 a game, asshole.

999
01:05:54,140 --> 01:05:55,140
That's what you're doing.

1000
01:05:55,140 --> 01:05:56,700
I'm not wasting my time with you.

1001
01:05:56,700 --> 01:05:59,500
But my whole point with this was that I showed them

1002
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,300
just exactly how stupid they were being.

1003
01:06:01,300 --> 01:06:01,860
Yeah, it's great.

1004
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:04,060
And then usually, there's other people that they get up and do

1005
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,020
that I have them kicked out of the arcade.

1006
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:06,440
You made a kid cry once.

1007
01:06:06,440 --> 01:06:07,700
That was the most beautiful thing ever.

1008
01:06:07,700 --> 01:06:09,100
It wasn't just you, but everybody.

1009
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,260
Because you did something, and then we all gathered around,

1010
01:06:12,260 --> 01:06:15,740
we were like yeah do it do it do it you stupid kid do it and he like ran off

1011
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:19,980
into the bathroom and you know he was crying yeah well like this when we were

1012
01:06:19,980 --> 01:06:23,020
playing pat-a-pat of those people who are getting back there and the one that

1013
01:06:23,020 --> 01:06:27,420
did not to me in the shoulder you know doing fake whatever I had like seven

1014
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:32,620
people kicked out the arcade that night Wow I used to be until I stopped because

1015
01:06:32,620 --> 01:06:35,980
I stopped going right after that I used to have people kicked out of the arcade

1016
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:39,980
every time I was there because I wouldn't stand for it I would not stand

1017
01:06:39,980 --> 01:06:43,980
to go into an arcade and see people acting like complete stupid idiots when the whole

1018
01:06:43,980 --> 01:06:47,660
purpose of going to an arcade is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.

1019
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:48,660
Yeah.

1020
01:06:48,660 --> 01:06:49,660
Alright.

1021
01:06:49,660 --> 01:06:50,660
Alright.

1022
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:53,220
Anyway, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna go to a break because we've been sitting here

1023
01:06:53,220 --> 01:06:54,220
for a while dishing on In the Groove.

1024
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:57,700
We're gonna come back, we're gonna talk about now what Konami's up to because everything

1025
01:06:57,700 --> 01:06:59,060
has just hit the fan this week.

1026
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:03,700
We were, it was seriously like you could see the tumbleweed flying across, you know, the

1027
01:07:03,700 --> 01:07:08,740
Bomani scene has been dead and now just seriously, like over the weekend, bam, it all hit.

1028
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:11,980
So we're going to talk about what now Konami's up to right after this break.

1029
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:14,580
In this break, since we've been talking a little bit about In the Groove, I figured

1030
01:07:14,580 --> 01:07:17,580
I'd humored the In the Groove fans with some music from In the Groove.

1031
01:07:17,580 --> 01:07:19,940
And in case you haven't actually played the game, you can hear what some of the music

1032
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:20,940
sounds like.

1033
01:07:20,940 --> 01:07:23,920
So we're going to start it off with some Nina with Fly With Me, and we'll be back with more

1034
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:30,920
Orange Launch Radio after this.

1035
01:07:53,920 --> 01:08:03,920
But I will be like a bird in the sky

1036
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:10,920
Finding your way to my home

1037
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:25,920
We like a bird, you have scarred my heart

1038
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:35,920
We like a bird, you have scarred my heart

1039
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:43,920
Free like a bird in the sky

1040
01:08:43,920 --> 01:08:49,920
I'm in your way to my heart

1041
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:55,920
Come play with me

1042
01:08:55,920 --> 01:09:03,920
Come play with me

1043
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:13,920
Come play with me, come play with me

1044
01:10:03,920 --> 01:10:19,920
Don't promise me a world that you can't figure out

1045
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:22,920
And you cannot escape

1046
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,920
Don't promise me freedom

1047
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:33,920
Don't promise me a bridge That you can't cross at all

1048
01:10:33,920 --> 01:10:42,920
Don't promise me a light That you can't knock at all

1049
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:44,920
Don't promise me

1050
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:19,920
You've got to get me out of here, you've got to get me out of here, you've got to get me

1051
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:46,240
MC confusion, I'm front a lot If I were MC from a little, I'd be tellin'

1052
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:49,160
you only ever what I'm not But I am the most frontin' this

1053
01:11:49,160 --> 01:11:52,320
Carvin' off the opposition Lil' son, just to confuse you

1054
01:11:52,320 --> 01:11:55,640
Whippin' like a villain, I got conundrums Your MC head, they're gonna fill in

1055
01:11:55,640 --> 01:11:59,800
Sillin', affect the mock you made My dexterity and 20 on the skills of display

1056
01:11:59,800 --> 01:12:04,560
That's alright, I'll take it as a compliment Shows you no nerd's course, it's dead

1057
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:05,560
Which MC was that?

1058
01:12:05,560 --> 01:12:07,840
I can't recollect I heard him on the internet

1059
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:10,920
And it was MC front or somethin' But I didn't hit save

1060
01:12:10,920 --> 01:12:12,920
Which MC was that? I couldn't say

1061
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,920
Maybe it was MC matter of fact

1062
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:21,420
He got the authenticity, easy riding his act

1063
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,420
Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit

1064
01:12:23,420 --> 01:12:25,420
He and DJ so sincere, don't quit

1065
01:12:25,420 --> 01:12:27,920
But I think for some reason that it wasn't him

1066
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:29,920
Wait, was it MC out on our limb?

1067
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,420
With the very risky dappin'?

1068
01:12:31,420 --> 01:12:32,920
Don't know what happened to the time

1069
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,420
Global contortion is squeezin'

1070
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,920
Tongue portions sublime on the mic

1071
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,420
Except for when the bow's breakin'

1072
01:12:37,420 --> 01:12:38,920
Kicked him out the liner, mistaked him

1073
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,420
Yo, it was definitely MC wrong Rockin' jam after jam of inaccurate songs

1074
01:12:43,420 --> 01:12:47,920
Then again they quipped the band MC in sight Striking suckers for bling with the lyrical light

1075
01:12:47,920 --> 01:12:52,420
Must confess I'm hard pressed to be certain Was it MC hot behind the curtain callin'?

1076
01:12:52,420 --> 01:12:56,420
Pay no attention to the man on the mic Must be the wizard when he rhymes so tight

1077
01:12:56,420 --> 01:13:00,420
You're havin' difficulty dredgin' out your brain The fact is which MC was that?

1078
01:13:00,420 --> 01:13:04,920
Which MC was that? I can't quite collect I heard him on the internet and it was MC front

1079
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:11,160
front or something but I didn't hit save which MC was that? I couldn't say. I couldn't say.

1080
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:18,280
Step up Poindexter, act smarter than you are about to pull the MC name out the jar and whoever

1081
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:23,720
gets closest wins a nine-sided die and a gift certificate to prize yo. The moniker is MC Front

1082
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:28,920
a lot. I got a plus one bag, an earth core hip-hop and my mail list busted. 100's on famous.

1083
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,920
It's unbelievable nobody know what my name is

1084
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,720
We all want destiny

1085
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:02,720
But we are floating through the clouds

1086
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,720
And someday we'll see

1087
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:06,920
That only when we dance we'll tomb

1088
01:14:08,820 --> 01:14:11,720
Cause we're like animals on the run

1089
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:13,520
La di da da da

1090
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:15,420
Li da di da da

1091
01:14:15,420 --> 01:14:16,820
La di da da

1092
01:14:16,820 --> 01:14:18,980
We are the animals on the run

1093
01:14:18,980 --> 01:14:21,120
La di da da da

1094
01:14:21,120 --> 01:14:22,020
Li da di da da

1095
01:14:22,020 --> 01:14:25,520
La-di-da-da, we're all like planets through the sun

1096
01:14:29,220 --> 01:14:32,720
La-di-da-da, we're all like planets through the sun

1097
01:14:39,520 --> 01:14:41,020
Talk about us, you and me

1098
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,820
Hey, can't you see we'll never be free?

1099
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,720
It's more, it's more like us

1100
01:14:44,720 --> 01:14:46,520
Down to back, we can't discuss

1101
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:48,320
We're demons of love and peace

1102
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:50,020
But in the end, we're on our knees

1103
01:15:20,020 --> 01:15:21,020
La de da da da, da de da da da

1104
01:15:22,020 --> 01:15:23,020
La de da da da, da de da da da

1105
01:15:24,020 --> 01:15:25,020
La de da da da, da de da da da

1106
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:27,020
We roll like lemons on the side

1107
01:15:28,020 --> 01:15:29,020
La de da da da, da de da da

1108
01:15:30,020 --> 01:15:31,020
La de da da da, da de da da

1109
01:15:32,020 --> 01:15:33,020
We are the lemons on the run

1110
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:34,780
Run, run, run, run, run

1111
01:15:40,020 --> 01:15:41,520
La de da da da, da de da da da

1112
01:15:46,020 --> 01:15:48,520
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio

1113
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:52,520
because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

1114
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:22,520
They've been trying to keep quiet about some of the things they're going to be doing at E3.

1115
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:25,520
You know, they like to surprise us. I think in Konami's list...

1116
01:16:25,520 --> 01:16:30,520
If they were trying to be quiet about it, why did they give it to GamePro?

1117
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:33,520
Let me get there for a minute, damn you.

1118
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:40,520
Alright, so usually, you know, they don't announce their stuff until it's getting closer to E3 time,

1119
01:16:40,520 --> 01:16:43,520
and you know, they save most their stuff for the show.

1120
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:45,520
But this year, some of the stuff's gotten out early.

1121
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:53,120
Actually IGN already blew the lid on the DDR with Mario is definitely going to be showing

1122
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,120
up.

1123
01:16:54,120 --> 01:16:55,380
And karaoke revolution 4.

1124
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,800
And they also blew the lid on karaoke revolution 4.

1125
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:03,640
And now what happened this week is that game pro magazine, their website, remember last

1126
01:17:03,640 --> 01:17:04,640
year?

1127
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:05,640
Yeah I know that happened last year too.

1128
01:17:05,640 --> 01:17:06,640
Shame shame.

1129
01:17:06,640 --> 01:17:09,080
Well they spoiled all the unlocks on DDR extreme last year.

1130
01:17:09,080 --> 01:17:14,320
And now what they did this year is they actually blew the lid on some big things going on.

1131
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:20,600
They actually have Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2, and some very observant observers over

1132
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:25,620
on DERFreak.com actually found these while they were surfing through GamePro's site.

1133
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:30,040
So the first one that we have details leaked on was Ultramix 3.

1134
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:35,360
Now, again, I think most people assumed both these games were going to be coming, but we

1135
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:40,860
have no idea in what shape or form these games are going to take, you know, especially with

1136
01:17:40,860 --> 01:17:45,860
UltraMix 3, because UltraMix is kind of, the PlayStation 1s have always kind of a little

1137
01:17:45,860 --> 01:17:50,300
bit, at least until DDR Extreme, they've always kind of taken the form of their Japanese releases

1138
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:53,020
in the arcade, but UltraMix has kind of always been doing its own thing.

1139
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:56,100
So I think UltraMix 3 especially are very curious to see what's going to happen with

1140
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,100
that.

1141
01:17:57,100 --> 01:18:01,840
So on the GamePro article, basically it reveals that there will be over 100 minutes of energetic

1142
01:18:01,840 --> 01:18:08,380
dance music, and it's going to have over 65 songs, and I'm assuming that the downloads

1143
01:18:08,380 --> 01:18:13,080
will still be accessible as well. In fact, actually it does say it's compatible with

1144
01:18:13,080 --> 01:18:17,880
all previous download song packs from DER and DER UltraMix 2, so that's 60 more songs

1145
01:18:17,880 --> 01:18:22,320
right there. So that's 125 songs if you already have all these packs from the start. Here

1146
01:18:22,320 --> 01:18:26,720
are some of the new modes you're going to have in DER UltraMix 3. Freestyle mode. And

1147
01:18:26,720 --> 01:18:31,760
that will allow you to dance just the way you want to to any song in the game while

1148
01:18:31,760 --> 01:18:37,080
rewarding you for doing different combinations. It's like a freestyle mode. So I think that

1149
01:18:37,080 --> 01:18:40,000
just means you get to dance with no arrows but maybe I don't know if it's

1150
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:44,880
like a recording mode or it's rewarding you for doing certain things like I

1151
01:18:44,880 --> 01:18:47,160
think that's that's the impression I'm getting from it is that if you do

1152
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:53,880
certain step combos during it you get rewarded interesting huh yeah no idea we

1153
01:18:53,880 --> 01:18:56,760
can't really tell from the names alone but that's pretty much all the article

1154
01:18:56,760 --> 01:19:04,560
gives us right there so there was that and let's see um also there's gonna have

1155
01:19:04,560 --> 01:19:10,660
quest mode quest mode is basically it's like a story mode now for DDR so DDR is

1156
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:17,760
now getting yes tody no continue it quest mode basically now yes didn't they

1157
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:21,960
do this with dance dance dance yeah but how many people in this this area know

1158
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:24,400
what that is I mean seriously how many people on the scene know what dance

1159
01:19:24,400 --> 01:19:27,880
dance dance is even maybe it's a really crappy game but now it's getting this

1160
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:33,000
quest mode you can travel virtually from city to city and build the ultimate

1161
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:38,360
dance team by completing challenging songs and routines along the way. So it's basically

1162
01:19:38,360 --> 01:19:45,360
a quest mode for DDR, like a story mode. It's Pokemon DDR! It's You Got Served The Game.

1163
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:53,480
Wow. That makes me sad. You know what though? It's cute, I guess. I mean, it's cute. I'm

1164
01:19:55,100 --> 01:20:02,100
jaded though, but still. It's the 9 year old slumber party mode, basically. Yeah. But you

1165
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:05,220
You know what that makes me think though, if you hear about that, that means that there

1166
01:20:05,220 --> 01:20:07,920
will have to be a lot of characters, I think.

1167
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,720
And that's one thing the Xbox games have been lacking, is that they don't have a lot of

1168
01:20:10,720 --> 01:20:11,720
characters.

1169
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:16,740
Ultra Mix 1 only had two characters, Ultra Mix 2 only had four characters and two downloads,

1170
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:19,180
and they weren't even really downloadable characters, you just unlocked them on the

1171
01:20:19,180 --> 01:20:20,180
disc.

1172
01:20:20,180 --> 01:20:21,180
So you have what, six characters?

1173
01:20:21,180 --> 01:20:24,100
Well, there's a whole library of dancing characters out there that haven't really been on the

1174
01:20:24,100 --> 01:20:29,060
Xbox yet, so I'm thinking maybe putting two and two together, that's probably what freestyle,

1175
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:32,800
story mode is going to encompass more of those characters and I'm hoping

1176
01:20:32,800 --> 01:20:37,360
more original characters and I'm really really hoping because this is Konami of Hawaii

1177
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:42,280
we will finally see the DDR PC characters crossover on the console

1178
01:20:42,280 --> 01:20:47,120
and that's right they need to travel to San Francisco in quest mode and meet

1179
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:53,600
Betty and Mr. Spanky. Did you ever see Mr. Spanky in DDR PC?

1180
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:57,720
No, I never played DDR PC actually. Are they going to be at the local, you know,

1181
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:00,400
bondage club?

1182
01:21:00,400 --> 01:21:01,900
I don't know, but...

1183
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:05,920
We haven't heard from Mr. Spanky in a long time. I know, we haven't. Well, who's played

1184
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,440
DDRPC lately?

1185
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:12,160
I have the chat room, doesn't even know what I'm talking about when I talk about Mr. Spanky.

1186
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:16,260
We should invite him back for a show one day. Some day, but somebody needs to find a

1187
01:21:16,260 --> 01:21:19,080
picture of Mr. Spanky first. I hope he's still on the internet somewhere.

1188
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:23,240
Maybe somebody will find that and post that. I would not Google search that.

1189
01:21:23,240 --> 01:21:26,480
Yeah, don't Google it, because you're not going to find that. You'll find other things

1190
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:30,280
that you don't want to see at your frail young age.

1191
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,200
Jukebox mode is another mode that's going to be in this game.

1192
01:21:33,200 --> 01:21:34,920
Jukebox mode, this is a quote from the article,

1193
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:38,600
jukebox mode turns your Xbox into a music machine,

1194
01:21:38,600 --> 01:21:42,900
allowing players to enjoy more than 65 tracks from the game.

1195
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,560
Whatever.

1196
01:21:43,560 --> 01:21:46,200
So it kind of sounds like a throwaway mode.

1197
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:49,360
But well, you know, with DDR having the full screen

1198
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:52,760
videos and everything, maybe there

1199
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,800
will be more full screen videos in UltraMix,

1200
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:59,040
because there's only been like one video in each game. We had to do that thing, which

1201
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:04,920
was really, really homoerotic, by the way, and then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja and

1202
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:09,600
Ultramix 2. So hopefully there'll be more like actual videos. Even if not, think about

1203
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:14,420
it. 2DX6 style had a mode like this. So, and it was well received, so maybe there'll

1204
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:20,440
be something like that. So we'll see. Of course there will be workout mode and of course edit

1205
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,840
mode and we're just going to assume here and assume that it still has the

1206
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:28,200
be able to upload your own steps because it does say you can upload content so we

1207
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:29,520
are assuming that to mean that

1208
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:33,320
you know you get to do your own steps again as well as online tournaments and

1209
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:35,280
Xbox Live Play. Whoop-dee-doo!

1210
01:22:35,280 --> 01:22:39,440
So, any thoughts on UltraMix 3? Things that

1211
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:43,160
UltraMix 3 needs that UltraMix 2 and 1 didn't have?

1212
01:22:43,160 --> 01:22:47,280
It needs a Pocari Sweat Dispenser. Come on, realistically.

1213
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:49,280
Maybe in story mode you might see it.

1214
01:22:53,280 --> 01:22:54,280
You know...

1215
01:22:57,280 --> 01:23:03,280
It's hard to think of new and innovative things to do with DDR in general.

1216
01:23:04,280 --> 01:23:06,280
Except they need freaking dance magic.

1217
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:08,280
Yeah.

1218
01:23:08,280 --> 01:23:14,280
I want a first person shooter minigame in this because every game should have a first person shooter aspect to it.

1219
01:23:14,280 --> 01:23:16,280
Well maybe in quest mode there'll be a, you know...

1220
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:24,280
You know Konami should take a cue from Namco. You know, your loading screens you can play a little, you know, old Konami game.

1221
01:23:24,280 --> 01:23:25,280
You could play Gradius.

1222
01:23:25,280 --> 01:23:29,280
I was freaking playing the hell out of Starblade on the Tekken 5.

1223
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,280
You could totally do Pac-Man or something on that pad.

1224
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,280
You know, um...

1225
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,280
But that's more midway.

1226
01:23:35,280 --> 01:23:39,280
UltraMix has some real shit loading times too in the very beginning. It takes forever for the game to boot.

1227
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:44,280
And I don't know if it's because you go through like five copyright screens before you finally get to the actual game.

1228
01:23:44,280 --> 01:23:47,920
game. Well, they're not all copyright, but you get one copyright screen, one screen that

1229
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:51,280
says Bumani, one screen that says... all this garbage that you need to be able to go through.

1230
01:23:51,280 --> 01:23:59,160
Like, Yair Kung Fu, and, you know, Super Konami World, and Castlevania.

1231
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:05,600
Here's my thing, though, with UltraMix III, is that I really, really, really hope they

1232
01:24:05,600 --> 01:24:09,640
keep up their relationship with a different drum. And I've been saying this every place

1233
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:13,260
I possibly can, because I really want to see this happen, because I think the different

1234
01:24:13,260 --> 01:24:17,260
drum music that we had in Ultramix 2 was seriously like the best thing to happen

1235
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:22,460
to DDR since DDR I don't know it was the best so I really hope they are gonna

1236
01:24:22,460 --> 01:24:25,380
continue that relationship with a different drum or at least even if not

1237
01:24:25,380 --> 01:24:30,860
that label specifically that whole idea of finding independent musicians who

1238
01:24:30,860 --> 01:24:35,980
make just as damn good music as anybody else and put it in the game to make big

1239
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:45,460
honestly you know honestly I just forgot I was gonna say okay I was sort of just

1240
01:24:45,460 --> 01:24:55,260
it's trying to wrap my mind around a whole I guess RPG mode in a DDR game I

1241
01:24:55,260 --> 01:24:59,100
still have flashbacks to dance dance dance and that game was horrible you

1242
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:01,500
know what I'll be very curious to see I don't know how much of this they're

1243
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:05,180
gonna show at e3 now you know last year Ultramix 2 we barely had anything at e3

1244
01:25:05,180 --> 01:25:09,700
In fact, a lot of people trashed Ultramix 2 saying, even I was looking at Ultramix 2

1245
01:25:09,700 --> 01:25:15,540
last year going, this is going to suck, and now I believe Ultramix 2 is the best home

1246
01:25:15,540 --> 01:25:19,520
release we've had on any system, period.

1247
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:23,680
And it kind of stank at E3 last year, so it's going to be interesting to see exactly how

1248
01:25:23,680 --> 01:25:26,260
much we get to see this year at E3.

1249
01:25:26,260 --> 01:25:27,260
I don't know.

1250
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:28,260
We'll see.

1251
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,920
And also, you know, another good thing that Ultramix has been pretty good on is providing

1252
01:25:30,920 --> 01:25:35,120
us with new, like, 10s for those folks that like the challenge and just, you know, and

1253
01:25:35,120 --> 01:25:38,640
I'm looking at you, Tody, the people that just can't enjoy DDR without there being 10-footers

1254
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
in it.

1255
01:25:39,640 --> 01:25:42,840
Well, it's not that I can't enjoy it, it's the fact that you'll come out with some new

1256
01:25:42,840 --> 01:25:45,400
song and you'll make it a 7-footer.

1257
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:51,360
I mean, during, I was with Loki when we were testing out DDR Extreme US, and I think it

1258
01:25:51,360 --> 01:25:57,040
was, and I think I triple-A'd, like, half of the new songs on the first try with the

1259
01:25:57,040 --> 01:26:00,180
bigger timing windows, and I'm like, okay, now what?

1260
01:26:00,180 --> 01:26:03,260
you know what what am i going to do with it

1261
01:26:03,260 --> 01:26:05,960
but you have to add a challenge difficulty or something i mean you have

1262
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,780
four difficulties to work with you can make one of those difficult to suit

1263
01:26:10,780 --> 01:26:14,880
everybody you know i think you have to remember though toady on the bell of

1264
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,340
players that these games are made to it you could imagine is on a graph that

1265
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,340
looks like an upside down bell curve

1266
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:24,800
you are way on the bottom over here you are one of the few that they need to

1267
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:26,000
cater to so

1268
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:29,480
just make a challenge difficulty

1269
01:26:29,480 --> 01:26:31,520
I'll design the damn steps myself.

1270
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,800
I mean, come on, there's more than enough people that would

1271
01:26:33,800 --> 01:26:35,920
be willing to do it, you know?

1272
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:38,560
Four difficulties or whatever.

1273
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:40,400
Make one hard one.

1274
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,320
We'll see, we'll see.

1275
01:26:41,320 --> 01:26:43,440
Anyway, so we will see what happens with Quest Mode a

1276
01:26:43,440 --> 01:26:44,120
little later on.

1277
01:26:44,120 --> 01:26:46,160
And of course, as we get more details, we'll post it to our

1278
01:26:46,160 --> 01:26:47,840
website, orangelandre.com.

1279
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:49,160
DDR Freak as well.

1280
01:26:49,160 --> 01:26:51,280
They've got lots and lots of news on this stuff.

1281
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,720
And all the other sites out there, I'm sure, reporting on

1282
01:26:53,720 --> 01:26:54,480
this as well.

1283
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,560
Speaking of DDR Freak, I want to mention this at some point

1284
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:57,280
during the show.

1285
01:26:57,280 --> 01:27:01,960
Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio are actually replays of this show, so to those of you guys

1286
01:27:01,960 --> 01:27:05,240
that are actually hearing this the first time on Friday night, DDR Freak, hello, and thanks

1287
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:09,820
for listening. So check that out over on The Freak, as we so lovingly call it here on this

1288
01:27:09,820 --> 01:27:17,100
show. Anything else on UltraMix you guys want to add in? Okay. We're going to talk about

1289
01:27:17,100 --> 01:27:20,260
Extreme 2, but first we're going to have ourselves a little bit of a cage match. We got to get

1290
01:27:20,260 --> 01:27:23,540
to that at some point tonight. Can you believe how fast this show is going by tonight? This

1291
01:27:23,540 --> 01:27:26,540
This is what happens when you actually have news to talk about.

1292
01:27:26,540 --> 01:27:27,540
It's crazy.

1293
01:27:27,540 --> 01:27:33,540
Alright, let's get into tonight's Cage Match, shall we?

1294
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:38,540
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

1295
01:27:38,540 --> 01:27:42,540
we had a song that featured Paula Terry on vocals actually winning this.

1296
01:27:42,540 --> 01:27:45,540
Look, you're gonna have to remind me, what the hell was the name of this song

1297
01:27:45,540 --> 01:27:47,540
and who did this and all that good stuff?

1298
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:48,540
Do you remember?

1299
01:27:48,540 --> 01:27:56,300
It was in Midnight Tune 2 or something like that, and some arcade racing game, and it

1300
01:27:56,300 --> 01:28:04,240
was Nothing Lives Forever starring Paul Osterre, and it was a guy that did the music from Act

1301
01:28:04,240 --> 01:28:05,240
Razor.

1302
01:28:05,240 --> 01:28:06,240
Alright, sounds good.

1303
01:28:06,240 --> 01:28:10,480
Okay, so we're going to play a clip from this one because it was last week's winner, and

1312
01:29:09,700 --> 01:29:19,700
I'm here today to conquer the world

1313
01:29:19,700 --> 01:29:29,700
Can't catch up

1314
01:29:29,700 --> 01:29:39,700
I don't mind if I'm not the only one for you

1315
01:29:39,700 --> 01:29:49,700
The time must come to say goodbye

1316
01:29:53,700 --> 01:30:03,700
Because nothing can keep forever

1317
01:30:03,700 --> 01:30:09,700
But I keep going back to you

1318
01:31:03,700 --> 01:31:28,460
Alright, that was a clip there of song number one, that was Polteri, Nothing Lives Forever.

1319
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:33,540
alright song number two is my song tonight and you know lately I've been

1320
01:31:33,540 --> 01:31:38,660
kind of downloading these random British trance and dance compilations I'm just

1321
01:31:38,660 --> 01:31:43,580
like I just want more dance music gimme gimme gimme so I found this one and I

1322
01:31:43,580 --> 01:31:48,620
kind of like this one it's it's a little bit poppy but I just like it so I'm

1323
01:31:48,620 --> 01:31:51,120
putting it in the cage match because I think you guys will like it too and I

1324
01:31:51,120 --> 01:31:56,180
think this is like total DDR songs so we'll see this artist is named diamond

1325
01:31:56,180 --> 01:32:01,180
Somebody I've never heard of, but this is the artist Diamond, and the song is Reason. Enjoy you guys.

1326
01:32:17,180 --> 01:32:22,180
Something in your eyes I know I can't resist

1327
01:32:22,180 --> 01:32:36,180
Something in the air, I don't know why You were hardly there when I was on my own

1328
01:32:36,180 --> 01:32:42,180
There's something about you that makes me cry

1329
01:32:42,180 --> 01:32:50,180
Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?

1330
01:32:50,180 --> 01:32:57,180
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny

1331
01:32:57,180 --> 01:33:02,180
I wanna know, give me a reason for me to believe in

1332
01:33:02,180 --> 01:33:05,180
Can't you see it in my eyes?

1333
01:33:05,180 --> 01:33:09,180
That I need a reason before I'm still breathing

1334
01:33:09,180 --> 01:33:12,180
Is it time to say goodbye?

1335
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,180
Cause deep in my heart I know

1336
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:17,180
There's a reason why I am not leaving

1337
01:33:17,180 --> 01:33:19,180
Why I'm not alone

1338
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,180
So give me a reason for me to believe it

1339
01:33:22,180 --> 01:33:26,180
Give me a reason

1340
01:33:26,180 --> 01:33:52,100
Something in your eyes still takes my breath away

1341
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:59,100
Something's deep inside, please tell me why

1342
01:33:59,100 --> 01:34:06,100
I don't know what I should do to break this spell

1343
01:34:06,100 --> 01:34:12,100
How can you make my life an alibi

1344
01:34:12,100 --> 01:34:15,100
Can I believe

1345
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:19,100
That your heart still beats for me

1346
01:34:19,100 --> 01:34:22,100
Let me receive

1347
01:34:22,100 --> 01:34:26,100
A sign that you're my destiny

1348
01:34:26,100 --> 01:34:28,100
I wanna know

1349
01:34:28,100 --> 01:34:31,100

That I need a reason for I'm so breathing

1352
01:34:38,100 --> 01:34:41,100
It's time to say goodbye

1353
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,100
Cause deep in my heart I know

1354
01:34:43,100 --> 01:34:46,100
There's a reason why I'm not leaving

1355
01:34:46,100 --> 01:34:48,100
Why I'm not alone

01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:51,600
So give me a reason for me to believe it

Give me a reason for me to believe it

1360
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,600

Is it time to say goodbye

1363
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:10,600
Cause deep in my heart I know

1364
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:13,600
There's a reason why I'm not leaving

1365
01:35:13,600 --> 01:35:15,600
Why I'm not alone

1366
01:35:15,600 --> 01:35:22,600
So gimme a reason for me to believe it Gimme a reason, gimme a reason

1367
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:50,600
It's all generic, so it gets a five and a half.

1368
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,600
Five and a half! Loki!

1369
01:35:52,600 --> 01:35:59,600
It was okay. The bass line reminded me of something from Rimmel or Run,

1370
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:04,600
but then it sounded like some other song I heard of, so I don't know.

1371
01:36:04,600 --> 01:36:09,600
It's just kind of, it's not bad, it just sounds familiar.

1372
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:14,600
And then, so I give it a seven, and then I give the porn on my PSP a ten.

1373
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,600
Which you were putting on cam during that song.

1374
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:17,600
Yes I did.

1375
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,600
You know what I think the familiarity is? Somebody pointed this out in the chat room.

1376
01:36:20,600 --> 01:36:23,600
Who said this? Because I totally agree with what they said.

1377
01:36:23,600 --> 01:36:25,600
I apologize to who said this because I can't.

1378
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:28,600
Oh, Fireboma said, it has a very Lasko feeling to it.

1379
01:36:28,600 --> 01:36:29,600
Oh no, Zaku said it first.

1380
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,600
Legend Zaku said it has a very Lasko sound to it.

1381
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:34,600
I kind of agree. It sounds like them.

1382
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,600
Which is interesting because Lasko actually had a song on this exact same CD,

1383
01:36:38,600 --> 01:36:41,600
but it sounded like totally unlike them, so go figure.

1384
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:52,600
Anyway, I like it. It's poppy. I think somebody said they could sing along to it. I feel the same way. It's a drive in my car and sing and feel happy and pretty. So I give it an 8.

1385
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:58,600
I was in the bathroom and I missed about half the song.

1386
01:36:58,600 --> 01:37:04,600
It sounded pretty generic to me. Like I said, I only caught the last third of it or so.

1387
01:37:04,600 --> 01:37:13,600
It didn't strike me as anything particularly outstanding. I'll give it a six.

1388
01:37:13,600 --> 01:37:15,600
Alrighty, Bud!

1389
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,600
I was in the kitchen and it sounded like standard pop.

1390
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:25,440
pop. And yeah, nothing terribly exciting. Six. It's definitely a drive in the car, sing

1391
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:31,440
along, be gay, all that. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah, I do that too. You be gay? Alright.

1392
01:37:31,440 --> 01:37:37,800
Gay isn't happy. Yes, exactly. Alright, alright. Anyway, let's move on. There is one more song

1393
01:37:37,800 --> 01:37:41,320
you guys get to vote for tonight. Here it is. It's Jamie's pick. Jamie, what did you

1394
01:37:41,320 --> 01:37:46,960
pick for us tonight? I'm sure people heard this on my Tuesday show, Plug Plug. But this

1395
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:54,960
This is a song off of the CD called Demograzie, which was by Damon Auburn of Blurr, also the guy behind Gorillaz.

1396
01:37:54,960 --> 01:37:56,960
Big surprise, huh?

1397
01:37:56,960 --> 01:38:01,960
But this is a remix of a song off of that album called A Rappy Song. It's really out there.

1398
01:38:01,960 --> 01:38:04,960
You know, the title alone makes me think of PSO.

1399
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:06,960
All Rappies?

1400
01:38:06,960 --> 01:38:09,960
Am I just a nerd because I think of Rag Rappies?

1401
01:38:09,960 --> 01:38:11,960
Keep in mind I haven't heard the song yet.

1402
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,960
How's this for nerdy?

1403
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:23,480
There is an item called an Alrappy that you can use to boost your stats and the developers

1404
01:38:23,480 --> 01:38:25,560
were using it for game testing.

1405
01:38:25,560 --> 01:38:28,280
And I've got some.

1406
01:38:28,280 --> 01:38:31,400
I cheated PSO and I'm proud of it.

1407
01:38:31,400 --> 01:38:38,400
Song number three tonight, Damon Albren with A Rappy Song, the remix. Enjoy.

1408
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:15,080
I'm drinking all the sunshine in the tea I'm taking my faith in my faith

1409
01:39:15,080 --> 01:39:23,080
And all my words will be shot up in your face It's a waste of fuel, I'm giving you a pen

1410
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:25,080
I'm dying

1411
01:39:25,080 --> 01:39:27,080
Oh

1412
01:39:27,080 --> 01:39:29,080
Ooh

1413
01:39:29,080 --> 01:39:31,080
Ooh

1414
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:33,080
Ooh

1415
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:35,080
Ooh

1416
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:37,080
Oh

1417
01:39:37,080 --> 01:39:39,080
Ooh

1418
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,080
Ooh

1419
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:43,080
Ooh

1420
01:39:43,080 --> 01:39:45,080
I

1421
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,080
I

1422
01:39:47,080 --> 01:39:49,080
I

1423
01:39:49,080 --> 01:39:51,080
I

1424
01:39:51,080 --> 01:39:53,880
No matter the feeling that your money can't buy

1425
01:39:53,880 --> 01:39:55,280
Becoming a slave to the rhythm

1426
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,680
There's no way that you could stop me now

1427
01:39:56,680 --> 01:39:58,680
I'd like to see you try

1428
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,080
Cause I'm already long gone

1429
01:40:00,080 --> 01:40:01,280
Don't be scared for me baby

1430
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:03,280
Let's throw me a chance to cry

1431
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:05,080
I can't believe you have to stay behind me

1432
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:06,680
Throw me your ass off with me baby

1433
01:40:06,680 --> 01:40:08,280
Tell me why

1434
01:40:08,280 --> 01:40:09,480
So lie your teeth on the cherry

1435
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:10,480
Don't follow me

1436
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:13,080
Throw me your feet to the side

1437
01:40:13,080 --> 01:40:14,680
But best believe I'm a-breathing

1438
01:40:14,680 --> 01:40:17,880
Break ground before I lie

1439
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:19,280
I know I'll never let live

1440
01:40:19,280 --> 01:40:21,280
But I know I won't let you die

1441
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:24,280
So go from Malta to the country

1442
01:40:24,280 --> 01:40:26,280
To the club and sing my song

1443
01:40:26,280 --> 01:40:29,280
And hopefully, I'll look at Chad and

1444
01:40:30,280 --> 01:40:33,280
She was friendly, but my camera's thin

1445
01:40:33,280 --> 01:40:35,280
That's the reason I wasn't in

1446
01:40:35,280 --> 01:40:38,280
My story when we come again

1447
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:41,280
I hope you like that

1448
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:43,280
And the white skin and the white hair

1449
01:40:43,280 --> 01:40:45,280
Like the lads who snitch when they style their hair

1450
01:40:45,280 --> 01:40:48,280
I like that crimp look, what they do with their bangs

1451
01:40:48,280 --> 01:40:52,280
But I feel like a faggot who's got two feet to chase those thighs

1452
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:55,280
I'm gonna get up on the side of motherfuckin' fries

1453
01:40:55,280 --> 01:40:57,280
I'm gonna get engraving, if you wanna lay me

1454
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:00,280
They make you can't stay awake even if you're crazy

1455
01:41:27,280 --> 01:41:56,720
Song number three.

1456
01:41:56,720 --> 01:42:02,400
Damon Albrun with a rappy song the remix. Did you think it was rappy or crappy?

1457
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:07,440
Dark Sakura. I'm just really pissed off at the people who are being fucking rude about all of these songs.

1458
01:42:07,440 --> 01:42:13,880
So I'm giving it... Don't let them ruffle your feathers. No, the thing is that I see this week

1459
01:42:13,880 --> 01:42:15,560
after week and this is bullshit.

1460
01:42:15,560 --> 01:42:19,880
You know, we are doing this show for you people and the least you can do is be nice, okay?

1461
01:42:19,880 --> 01:42:24,160
So I give the chat room a negative 50 and I give my song a 10.

1462
01:42:24,160 --> 01:42:32,160
Alright, Loki. I didn't care for this song. Not at all. It's a four.

1463
01:42:33,160 --> 01:42:44,160
I thought it was kind of quirky. I don't know. It had a nice groove to it, though. I can't say I didn't like it, because I thought it was kind of groovy and it made me bounce, so that's worth something, so I give it a seven.

1464
01:42:44,160 --> 01:42:49,080
Cody yeah I gotta agree with that I mean it was pretty damn weird but I noticed I

1465
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:54,760
was sitting there like you know bouncing and you know yeah it's quirky yeah it

1466
01:42:54,760 --> 01:42:57,520
was it was something I think I could listen to I'd give it an eight I like

1467
01:42:57,520 --> 01:43:04,880
that one alrighty but give it a seven it was definitely something you can pop

1468
01:43:04,880 --> 01:43:10,400
along to all right all right that being said let's recap the three songs you can

Yes.

1481
01:44:22,220 --> 01:44:25,340
they will help you out because they're nice all right this is the part of the

1482
01:44:25,340 --> 01:44:28,580
show where I usually ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene so Loki what's

1483
01:44:28,580 --> 01:44:33,740
going on in the sim scene as far as I'm aware nothing and I am double-checking

1484
01:44:33,740 --> 01:44:38,060
to make sure you know that that's not the case I would hope that there's

1485
01:44:38,060 --> 01:44:47,660
something going on anyways no really um I don't think there is anything going on

1486
01:44:47,660 --> 01:44:52,600
as far as releases go because I was checking the other day for some brand

1487
01:44:52,600 --> 01:44:57,980
new you know the food mix stuff see if there's any you know new stuff for that

1488
01:44:57,980 --> 01:45:05,840
but um no no there there wasn't so but like I said I'm double checking right

1489
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:13,340
now. I should have done this earlier. Shame on you! Whatever, you know, honestly, it doesn't

1490
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:23,180
matter. But anyways, let's see here. You might check out DDRUK since they're still coming

1491
01:45:23,180 --> 01:45:37,060
about and I'm sure they're working on still the brand new Sim Files 4. I think they're

1492
01:45:37,060 --> 01:45:42,500
finishing up Ultramix 2 or something. They're the song packs for Ultramix 2, last time I

1493
01:45:42,500 --> 01:45:49,980
checked. But really other than that, you're not going to find much new stuff out there

1494
01:45:49,980 --> 01:45:54,980
because there really isn't that much new stuff coming around.

1495
01:45:54,980 --> 01:45:58,100
Let's see if there's any developments in the food mix thing here.

1496
01:45:58,100 --> 01:46:01,180
I wish. Food mix 2 needs to come out.

1497
01:46:01,180 --> 01:46:05,300
It needs to come out now so we can like... Are they actually doing a food mix 2?

1498
01:46:05,300 --> 01:46:08,260
Yep, remember? Oh, hot.

1499
01:46:08,260 --> 01:46:10,520
I reported that a while ago.

1500
01:46:10,520 --> 01:46:14,840
No, anyways, I forgot. Okay, kill me.

1501
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:18,980
No, here's what's going on. Looks like DDR C&C style

1502
01:46:18,980 --> 01:46:21,820
uh... selection from beat mario

1503
01:46:21,820 --> 01:46:23,660
uh...

1504
01:46:23,660 --> 01:46:28,340
it was up their web pages updated whatever that's supposed to mean

1505
01:46:28,340 --> 01:46:32,700
i don't know doesn't say anything so guess what folks that means nothing's

1506
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,460
going on nada

1507
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:39,140
to some more shitty simp files online

1508
01:46:39,140 --> 01:46:42,540
but hey you can't believe of myself that's all of you know how many max

1509
01:46:42,540 --> 01:46:45,220
remixes posted in the last day

1510
01:46:45,220 --> 01:46:47,640
let's find out shall we

1511
01:46:47,640 --> 01:46:54,760
Now honestly, I haven't seen that many max remixes lately.

1512
01:46:54,760 --> 01:46:57,120
I actually haven't seen any max remixes lately.

1513
01:46:57,120 --> 01:47:03,160
I think they may be just not even trying to make them with

1514
01:47:03,160 --> 01:47:04,480
any structure whatsoever.

1515
01:47:04,480 --> 01:47:07,880
The ones I've seen have been like these stupid bots files.

1516
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,200
And those are really crappy.

1517
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:13,320
But just for shits and giggles, let's see how many max

1518
01:47:13,320 --> 01:47:17,360
remixes there are since the last time we broadcast.

1519
01:47:17,360 --> 01:47:19,600
I vote 20.

1520
01:47:19,600 --> 01:47:21,600
You think 20?

1521
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:23,420
Okay.

1522
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:27,240
And the winner is...

1523
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:28,880
uh...

1524
01:47:28,880 --> 01:47:31,640
well, let's see here.

1525
01:47:31,640 --> 01:47:36,640
Since last time we have done the show, there have been one, two, three, four, five, six,

1526
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:40,080
seven, eight, nine maxsim files. Now,

1527
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:43,720
granted...

1528
01:47:43,720 --> 01:47:46,500
Okay, okay, here's a list here. We've got

1529
01:47:46,500 --> 01:47:50,580
Maximizer, which I assume is just some fun steps to the Maximizers.

1530
01:47:50,580 --> 01:47:55,580
Um, StaryonSurvivormax. StaryonSurvivormax!

1531
01:47:55,580 --> 01:47:58,380
StaryonSurvivormax. Die! Um,

1532
01:47:58,380 --> 01:48:01,940
RizlaMaxDeepDynamiteSomethingRoder, something along

1533
01:48:01,940 --> 01:48:06,700
the sim file that was a joke. MaxAttack version 2, Trip Machine Climax,

1534
01:48:06,700 --> 01:48:12,820
easy edit. MaxPeriod, another edit. Max420LLDJOB

1535
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:22,820
V-I-S-D-J-Vichese, Eat Your Heart Assum, Joke File, and Max Unlimited, Edit, and Max Wipeout version 2.

1536
01:48:23,820 --> 01:48:28,820
Honestly, folks, none of this stuff's worth downloading. Just save your time.

1537
01:48:28,820 --> 01:48:31,820
Do something more constructive, like download porn. Seriously.

1538
01:48:31,820 --> 01:48:35,820
Honestly, there's a lot more porn out there than, you know, SIM files.

1539
01:48:35,820 --> 01:48:40,820
And you know what? With porn, you can never get bad porn, so that's good to know.

1540
01:48:40,820 --> 01:48:49,320
Alright, anything else? I say, you know, make porn, not, you know, bad max symphiles.

1541
01:48:49,320 --> 01:48:52,320
That's what, actually, no, I don't want to see anyone making porn.

1542
01:48:52,320 --> 01:48:54,820
Yeah, please don't, don't make your own porn. Don't, don't.

1543
01:48:54,820 --> 01:48:57,820
Especially considering most of you are under 18. Don't do that!

1544
01:48:57,820 --> 01:48:59,320
That would be illegal.

1545
01:48:59,320 --> 01:49:02,320
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, guys.

1546
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:06,320
I want to start talking about Xtreme 2 a little bit, though, but if you do want to get in on the Skype line,

1547
01:49:06,320 --> 01:49:12,320
Let me tell you this, I know that tons of people want to get in tonight, so be ready.

1548
01:49:12,320 --> 01:49:19,320
I've actually got emails of people that want to get in, or wanting me to open it up special for them, so you're going to have to go against them.

1549
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:24,320
www.orangelandsradio.com, click on interact with us and get your program ready.

1550
01:49:24,320 --> 01:49:28,480
Anyway, I want to talk about Xtreme 2 real quick.

1551
01:49:28,480 --> 01:49:37,480
Now, the person that found DDR UltraMix 3 was this person, Tep, over on DDRFreak.

1552
01:49:37,480 --> 01:49:44,240
And then after Tep found out about the UltraMix 3, one of the admins over there, Cutris, actually

1553
01:49:44,240 --> 01:49:48,880
went over and started kind of, I guess, scouring GamePro's site a little bit and found out

1554
01:49:48,880 --> 01:49:52,560
that GamePro also spilled the beans on Xtreme 2.

1555
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:58,600
Oops, they did it again and I say that for a reason because one of the big shockers in

1556
01:49:58,600 --> 01:50:04,120
this article is that Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 will have Genie in a Bottle and

1557
01:50:04,120 --> 01:50:10,640
Oops I Did It Again as confirmed songs.

1558
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:15,540
Now I know this thrills Dark Sakura to no end here considering how she feels about that

1559
01:50:15,540 --> 01:50:16,540
type of music.

1560
01:50:16,540 --> 01:50:17,960
It's not Jenny in a Bottle?

1561
01:50:17,960 --> 01:50:18,960
It's not Jenny in a Bottle.

1562
01:50:18,960 --> 01:50:25,960
How about shit in a bag? Set that on fire.

1563
01:50:25,960 --> 01:50:29,840
Alright, so that was one big revolution, uh, revolution, revelation made.

1564
01:50:29,840 --> 01:50:34,200
Uh, again, they're saying over a hundred minutes of dance music gonna be in there,

1565
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:37,580
and they're saying, this is what GamePro is saying, now keep in mind that I believe it was

1566
01:50:37,580 --> 01:50:40,640
them or somebody said this last year and it didn't really happen, but they are

1567
01:50:40,640 --> 01:50:41,560
saying

1568
01:50:41,560 --> 01:50:43,200
PlayStation 2 owners,

1569
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:47,680
excuse me, will be able to go head-to-head with a new online feature.

1570
01:50:47,680 --> 01:50:50,020
So the online thing...

1571
01:50:50,020 --> 01:50:53,020
Excuse me, I'm choking over here. The online thing doing so well in Extreme...

1572
01:50:53,020 --> 01:50:54,320
I'm sorry, Ultramix 2,

1573
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:57,620
that now it's going to be a part of Extreme 2 as well.

1574
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:00,520
So, very interesting, I think.

1575
01:51:00,520 --> 01:51:04,240
And as if you didn't know enough stupid people on Xbox Live, now you get to

1576
01:51:04,240 --> 01:51:07,900
meet them on PlayStation 2, which opens up a whole new world of stupid people.

1577
01:51:07,900 --> 01:51:09,180
Um...

1578
01:51:09,180 --> 01:51:13,000
And then that's about it, although we do know that iToy Support is coming back,

1579
01:51:13,000 --> 01:51:14,720
and as well...

1580
01:51:14,720 --> 01:51:17,920
Yeah, itoy support's coming back, and let's see.

1581
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:20,800
Workout mode is coming as well, and you get to do your

1582
01:51:20,800 --> 01:51:23,800
own steps in edit mode, of course, as well.

1583
01:51:23,800 --> 01:51:25,000
So that's about it.

1584
01:51:25,000 --> 01:51:27,640
The online mode being the biggest thing about that, as

1585
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:30,760
well as the genie in a bottle, and oops, I did it again.

1586
01:51:30,760 --> 01:51:34,200
So this goes back to what I said earlier.

1587
01:51:34,200 --> 01:51:35,960
Remember I said I'd mention this again.

1588
01:51:35,960 --> 01:51:39,320
Remember, boys and girls, DDR Extreme is not made for you.

1589
01:51:39,320 --> 01:51:41,960
It's made partially for you, and you'll get

1590
01:51:41,960 --> 01:51:42,680
something out of it.

1591
01:51:42,680 --> 01:51:44,560
You'll get your Sakura, I'm sure.

1592
01:51:44,560 --> 01:51:47,660
I don't know anything for sure, but I think it's a given that Sakura will probably show

1593
01:51:47,660 --> 01:51:49,120
up in this one.

1594
01:51:49,120 --> 01:51:52,280
But now, for the Slumber Party girls, they're going to have Genie in a Bottle and oops,

1595
01:51:52,280 --> 01:51:53,280
I did it again.

1596
01:51:53,280 --> 01:51:54,280
Deal.

1597
01:51:54,280 --> 01:51:57,200
And you also have to remember that none of these girls usually, I shouldn't say none,

1598
01:51:57,200 --> 01:52:01,680
a very small percentage of these nine-year-old Slumber Party girls are going to play on heavy,

1599
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:07,400
but Konami's going to give them seven footsteps with, you know, 200 steps on heavy anyway,

1600
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:08,400
so.

1601
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:11,200
Wouldn't it be comedy gold, though, if they made Genie in a Bottle like a ten-footer?

1602
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:15,560
i would actually probably by the game

1603
01:52:15,560 --> 01:52:18,120
just as a joke

1604
01:52:18,120 --> 01:52:21,240
but you know it but this is interesting if it's online and people can create

1605
01:52:21,240 --> 01:52:23,940
their own steps you know there's gonna be ten footsteps out there to oops i

1606
01:52:23,940 --> 01:52:25,560
didn't get that they'll be crap

1607
01:52:25,560 --> 01:52:28,240
it'll be like finger finger revolution separately

1608
01:52:28,240 --> 01:52:32,520
oops to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

1609
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:36,600
was made no sex just a big string of sixteenth note they go into a random

1610
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,860
no sensical order whatsoever much like many in the group twelve footers

1611
01:52:40,860 --> 01:52:45,860
Or they'll just go in and add triplets which don't go to anything.

1612
01:52:45,860 --> 01:52:50,860
So, very interesting.

1613
01:52:50,860 --> 01:52:53,860
It was actually EGM, thank you for the tip there.

1614
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:57,860
EGM was actually the one that said that online play would be included last year and they were wrong.

1615
01:52:57,860 --> 01:52:59,860
But now GamePro is saying it this year.

1616
01:52:59,860 --> 01:53:04,860
And hopefully, I don't know, do you think online play is a good thing for DDR?

1617
01:53:04,860 --> 01:53:06,860
I think it's a bad thing.

1618
01:53:06,860 --> 01:53:11,860
Are you asking me that specifically? Or are you asking the chat room?

1619
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:16,860
I guess anybody in the room that wants to answer that. We'll do the Skype line thing later for those who want to ask.

1620
01:53:16,860 --> 01:53:24,860
Well, unless they, well, it's pretty much impossible for them to tell who's using a controller and who's using a pad.

1621
01:53:24,860 --> 01:53:27,860
I mean, it's really not worth my time to try and put forth a bunch of...

1622
01:53:27,860 --> 01:53:29,860
Well, now Xbox Live will tell you who's using a controller.

1623
01:53:29,860 --> 01:53:30,860
Really?

1624
01:53:30,860 --> 01:53:34,940
I thought, I was actually under the impression that they had some sort of system that allowed

1625
01:53:34,940 --> 01:53:37,300
them to bypass that.

1626
01:53:37,300 --> 01:53:40,780
I think, everybody will hack anything.

1627
01:53:40,780 --> 01:53:42,260
But it's really the minority.

1628
01:53:42,260 --> 01:53:44,380
I don't think I've run into any of those people.

1629
01:53:44,380 --> 01:53:45,380
Everything I have is legit.

1630
01:53:45,380 --> 01:53:49,340
The only problem is that some pads, the home built ones, I think Cobalt Fluxes will show

1631
01:53:49,340 --> 01:53:50,340
up as controllers.

1632
01:53:50,340 --> 01:53:51,340
Really?

1633
01:53:51,340 --> 01:53:54,260
So unfortunately some people that do really bad, they're like, I swear I'm on a pad, I

1634
01:53:54,260 --> 01:53:55,260
swear I'm on a pad.

1635
01:53:55,260 --> 01:53:56,260
Yeah.

1636
01:53:56,260 --> 01:54:00,420
So, I'm hoping that that feature will carry over into PlayStation 2.

1637
01:54:00,420 --> 01:54:05,340
somebody will hack it, it's a given, but you know, for 99% of players it's not gonna matter.

1638
01:54:05,340 --> 01:54:08,620
Yeah, I mean, I guess for the people that can't get out to an arcade it's great. I mean,

1639
01:54:08,620 --> 01:54:12,660
for me, I would never use it. I'd just rather go to my local arcade or whatever and play

1640
01:54:12,660 --> 01:54:14,620
people. But this is interesting because this is kind

1641
01:54:14,620 --> 01:54:17,780
of ties into what you were talking about in the last show, Loki, is you were talking about

1642
01:54:17,780 --> 01:54:22,080
this is where DDR is going, is that because the arcades are dying and nobody seems to

1643
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:27,740
care anymore, online mode is where it's going to. So does this news surprise you at all,

1644
01:54:27,740 --> 01:54:29,180
Okay, I'm kind of curious.

1645
01:54:29,180 --> 01:54:33,500
No, but then again, they need more things that be on their network adapter.

1646
01:54:33,500 --> 01:54:37,660
After all, they don't want to be like the GameCube.

1647
01:54:37,660 --> 01:54:40,860
Well, now who knows? There might be some big thing that comes down with DDR with

1648
01:54:40,860 --> 01:54:44,140
Mario, which is the one game we didn't get any news on this week.

1649
01:54:44,140 --> 01:54:45,420
Very soon, though.

1650
01:54:45,420 --> 01:54:49,140
Think about it, guys. We're only a week and a half away. Honestly, folks, do you really

1651
01:54:49,140 --> 01:54:52,200
think you're going to get online play with anything

1652
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:53,900
on the GameCube? No.

1653
01:54:53,900 --> 01:54:55,700
You'll get LAN play.

1654
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:58,260
hello and play

1655
01:54:58,260 --> 01:55:00,580
enjoying the maybe maybe

1656
01:55:00,580 --> 01:55:04,500
yeah i i would expect it on my play the arm are you'll be very weird because

1657
01:55:04,500 --> 01:55:07,740
the yard mario city kids on how to use the internet the hell we're talking

1658
01:55:07,740 --> 01:55:10,260
about

1659
01:55:10,260 --> 01:55:12,340
all right honestly

1660
01:55:12,340 --> 01:55:14,180
damn mario fucking a

1661
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:18,620
by the plumb something i mean i was the he's been doing a lot of like mackin on

1662
01:55:18,620 --> 01:55:19,620
princesses

1663
01:55:19,620 --> 01:55:25,140
and like smashing turtles but i haven't actually seen you know unclog a toilet

1664
01:55:25,140 --> 01:55:27,620
Oh, he just unclogs the princess all the time.

1665
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:31,620
No, they unclog the pipes of all of those monsters in Mario Brothers.

1666
01:55:31,620 --> 01:55:32,620
He cleans her pipes.

1667
01:55:32,620 --> 01:55:33,620
He cleans her pipes.

1668
01:55:33,620 --> 01:55:34,620
Waxes.

1669
01:55:34,620 --> 01:55:35,620
With his plunger.

1670
01:55:35,620 --> 01:55:36,620
God.

1671
01:55:36,620 --> 01:55:42,620
We've sunk that low.

1672
01:55:42,620 --> 01:55:43,620
Yes, we have.

1673
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:44,620
All right.

1674
01:55:44,620 --> 01:55:47,620
I think that's a sign that we probably should reveal the cage match winner.

1675
01:55:47,620 --> 01:55:49,660
Are you guys ready to hear about the cage match winner tonight?

1676
01:55:49,660 --> 01:55:50,660
I don't care.

1677
01:55:50,660 --> 01:55:51,660
Why not?

1678
01:55:51,660 --> 01:55:53,940
Tons of people voted in tonight's cage match.

1679
01:55:53,940 --> 01:55:56,780
I think this is one of the largest turnouts we've had in a while.

1680
01:55:56,780 --> 01:56:00,420
And the winning song won by only two votes, if you can believe that.

1681
01:56:00,420 --> 01:56:03,420
You want to hear the song that won?

1682
01:56:03,420 --> 01:56:04,420
We'll see.

1683
01:56:04,420 --> 01:56:09,260
Damon Albrin with the rapping song.

1684
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:12,900
No, I'm really fucking surprised.

1685
01:56:12,900 --> 01:56:13,900
You know what?

1686
01:56:13,900 --> 01:56:17,420
I think what happened, because the other songs had the exact same number of votes, I think

1687
01:56:17,420 --> 01:56:21,620
the trance vote got split and it allowed the quirk thing to go through.

1688
01:56:21,620 --> 01:56:26,340
Either that, or after you spanked everybody in the chat room, they voted for you out of

1689
01:56:26,340 --> 01:56:27,340
fear.

1690
01:56:27,340 --> 01:56:32,340
No, seriously, all I wanted was for people just to be a little bit more open.

1691
01:56:32,340 --> 01:56:33,460
And it wasn't just for me.

1692
01:56:33,460 --> 01:56:35,860
They were bitching about everything that went through.

1693
01:56:35,860 --> 01:56:38,800
So I was like, stop bitching, just listen.

1694
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,500
You know what?

1695
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:41,500
People will bitch about everything.

1696
01:56:41,500 --> 01:56:42,500
It's what the internet's for.

1697
01:56:42,500 --> 01:56:43,500
You know what?

1698
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:46,780
As an internet celebrity, you're going to have to deal with this.

1699
01:56:46,780 --> 01:56:48,500
I know.

1700
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:51,580
There's going to be paparazzi out there that are going to photograph you when you're

1701
01:56:51,580 --> 01:56:57,640
Only celebrity, I have to throw a temper tantrum every so often so they can be on the cover

1702
01:56:57,640 --> 01:57:03,080
of the star and then I can sue them for money for something.

1703
01:57:03,080 --> 01:57:04,080
You know what we need?

1704
01:57:04,080 --> 01:57:09,860
We need like an internet version of the star and we should be in it, but it has to be a

1705
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:10,860
flattering story.

1706
01:57:10,860 --> 01:57:14,500
We can't have any, you know, no fat pictures of me or nude sunbathing or anything like

1707
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:15,500
that.

1708
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:19,140
How about we make a website called fakenews.com?

1709
01:57:19,140 --> 01:57:20,620
They probably already have it.

1710
01:57:20,620 --> 01:57:21,620
That's why we're not going to make it.

1711
01:57:21,620 --> 01:57:22,620
Alright, let me check.

1712
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:23,620
I got a picture.

1713
01:57:23,620 --> 01:57:25,620
Hey, moviepoopshoot.com is still around.

1714
01:57:25,620 --> 01:57:27,620
Oh my God.

1715
01:57:27,620 --> 01:57:31,980
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, it's your

1716
01:57:31,980 --> 01:57:36,740
show boys and girls, and I always fear this part of the show when I let it be their show.

1717
01:57:36,740 --> 01:57:37,740
Ha!

1718
01:57:37,740 --> 01:57:39,300
There is no fakenews.com.

1719
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:40,540
We will make it happen.

1720
01:57:40,540 --> 01:57:42,740
Now somebody's going to get to it before you.

1721
01:57:42,740 --> 01:57:43,740
We'll see.

1722
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:44,740
Alright, anyway.

1723
01:57:44,740 --> 01:57:45,740
Anyway, guys.

1724
01:57:45,740 --> 01:57:46,740
We're going to go to a break.

1725
01:57:46,740 --> 01:57:49,080
When we come back, it's your show because we are going to open up the Skype line right

1726
01:57:49,080 --> 01:57:50,080
after this.

1727
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:53,680
this break though you get music from I figure since we've done a lot of home

1728
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:57,920
stuff tonight we're gonna do Ultramix 2 in this break so enjoy this selection

1729
01:57:57,920 --> 01:57:59,920
music from Ultramix 2 and we'll be back after this.

1730
01:58:27,920 --> 01:58:31,560
But you gotta tell me, what you wanna do

1731
01:58:31,560 --> 01:58:36,760

1745
02:03:56,700 --> 02:04:01,700
aah

1746
02:04:01,700 --> 02:04:06,700

aah

1749
02:04:46,700 --> 02:04:52,700
To the words I'm saying baby, I found my soul

1750
02:04:52,700 --> 02:04:56,700
And it keeps me hanging on

1751
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:59,700
Understand me now

1752
02:04:59,700 --> 02:05:06,700
To the words I'm saying baby, I found my soul

1753
02:05:06,700 --> 02:05:10,700

El Mullet calling.

1761
02:06:06,580 --> 02:06:07,580
Hello, El Mullet.

1762
02:06:07,580 --> 02:06:08,580
How are you?

1763
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:09,580
Good.

1764
02:06:09,580 --> 02:06:10,580
How about yourself?

1765
02:06:10,580 --> 02:06:11,580
Good.

1766
02:06:11,580 --> 02:06:15,900
I think we have a little bit of a delay, so start talking.

1767
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:19,980
What's on your mind?

1768
02:06:19,980 --> 02:06:26,140
Well basically, now that we've got the news on Extreme 2 and UltraMix 3, I'm starting

1769
02:06:26,140 --> 02:06:28,940
to get pretty pumped for this year's E3.

1770
02:06:28,940 --> 02:06:31,340
I am absolutely pumped for this year's E3.

1771
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:36,820
When you consider that we have Extreme 2 and we have Ultramix 3, and we have DDR with Mario,

1772
02:06:36,820 --> 02:06:42,580
and we have Karaoke Revolution 4, and we have God knows whatever Red Octane's going to show,

1773
02:06:42,580 --> 02:06:47,500
and whatever Korean crap shows up in Kenshiya Hall, this is going to be a beautiful E3 for

1774
02:06:47,500 --> 02:06:48,500
us music gamers.

1775
02:06:48,500 --> 02:06:51,900
I'm very happy.

1776
02:06:51,900 --> 02:06:56,500
This is going to be the best year for music games, period.

1777
02:06:56,500 --> 02:06:59,420
And I do have something to say for all of you.

1778
02:06:59,420 --> 02:07:00,420
Yes.

1779
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:03,620
What would you like to say?

1780
02:07:03,620 --> 02:07:08,220
I was going to say anything... what I want to say to all the naysayers, to all the

1781
02:07:08,220 --> 02:07:11,140
people who decided to come out and bitch right out

1782
02:07:11,140 --> 02:07:12,060
of the gate

1783
02:07:12,060 --> 02:07:14,180
as soon as the announcements were made.

1784
02:07:14,180 --> 02:07:15,540
Shut up!

1785
02:07:15,540 --> 02:07:19,780
You don't know what's going to be on these games outside of genie and

1786
02:07:19,780 --> 02:07:20,540
oops.

1787
02:07:20,540 --> 02:07:24,900
And that's two songs out of a possible sixty five plus song mix.

1788
02:07:24,900 --> 02:07:27,860
Shut up!

1789
02:07:27,860 --> 02:07:32,200
I agree, I agree. Those people just need to sit down and shut up until we have more information

1790
02:07:32,200 --> 02:07:35,660
on the game. You want to know why no company wants to release

1791
02:07:35,660 --> 02:07:41,020
information on games before E3? It's because this is what people do with, you know, any

1792
02:07:41,020 --> 02:07:45,600
game that has a loyal fan base, is that people start just tearing the shit apart, and they

1793
02:07:45,600 --> 02:07:50,940
dream up this own list in their head of everything they want, or the game's going to suck, and

1794
02:07:50,940 --> 02:07:54,100
then, you know, they're disappointed because the developers have a different vision. So

1795
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:59,060
So you wanna know why everybody keeps it in their pants until E3?

1796
02:07:59,060 --> 02:08:00,060
This is why.

1797
02:08:00,060 --> 02:08:01,060
It's a perfect example.

1798
02:08:01,060 --> 02:08:02,860
Go look at the thread and everybody bitching,

1799
02:08:02,860 --> 02:08:08,580
Eh eh, why is oops I did it again on the game, eh eh eh.

1800
02:08:08,580 --> 02:08:09,580
Any thoughts?

1801
02:08:09,580 --> 02:08:15,660
Why can't it be like arcades that have all my favorite songs on them?

1802
02:08:15,660 --> 02:08:18,460
Where's my max period from the other home version?

1803
02:08:18,460 --> 02:08:21,600
My god, some people piss me off.

1804
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:23,460
This game better have Sakura.

1805
02:08:23,460 --> 02:08:27,460
I'm not buying this game unless Sakura is in it!

1806
02:08:27,460 --> 02:08:31,340
Jesus people, Sakura is like the most horrid song

1807
02:08:31,340 --> 02:08:36,660
in DDRXtreme. I just... I will not buy this game unless Sakura is not in it!

1808
02:08:36,660 --> 02:08:40,380
Ha! Got you!

1809
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:43,060
Sakura makes everything cool.

1810
02:08:43,060 --> 02:08:47,340
I want as much licensed mainstream crap

1811
02:08:47,340 --> 02:08:52,500
as humanly possible. I want to see people so pissed off

1812
02:08:52,500 --> 02:08:57,580
This year's song list says Steam is coming out of their ears while I sit back, copy of

1813
02:08:57,580 --> 02:09:00,740
Extreme 2, laughing my ass off.

1814
02:09:00,740 --> 02:09:01,740
That's right.

1815
02:09:01,740 --> 02:09:02,740
You know what?

1816
02:09:02,740 --> 02:09:04,380
Let's dream for a minute here.

1817
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:09,220
Let's think about if I were to make DDR Extreme 2.

1818
02:09:09,220 --> 02:09:10,780
Let's think for a minute here.

1819
02:09:10,780 --> 02:09:14,540
What types of songs would I want to put in Extreme 2?

1820
02:09:14,540 --> 02:09:15,540
Let me think.

1821
02:09:15,540 --> 02:09:18,540
I'm going to make my mix here for a minute here.

1822
02:09:18,540 --> 02:09:19,540
Let's see.

1823
02:09:19,540 --> 02:09:23,420
have oops I did it again and genie in a bottle would definitely have to be in

1824
02:09:23,420 --> 02:09:29,260
this and and I was trying to cue up some musical stuff but my thing is froze there

1825
02:09:29,260 --> 02:09:38,180
we go there we go thank you okay let's see oh did the feed drop no I think we're

1826
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:42,480
still here I'm still with you okay delay but I'm still with you I think we had a

1827
02:09:42,480 --> 02:09:50,380
a spot of downtime there, but we're back. Who cares? We're just like rambling. The Internet

1828
02:09:50,380 --> 02:09:57,540
declines your request of making a custom DVR mix. Sorry, Rob. Yeah, I guess so. The Internet

1829
02:09:57,540 --> 02:10:02,320
just didn't want that to happen. My bad. All this must not happen. I think it was live

1830
02:10:02,320 --> 02:10:10,820
365 because we never disconnected. Shut up. I'm not sure what happened there, guys. All

1831
02:10:10,820 --> 02:10:13,820
Alright, let's just keep rolling here, because the archives will go on.

1832
02:10:13,820 --> 02:10:17,820
So, I guess if you want to hear what happened during the chaos moment there,

1833
02:10:17,820 --> 02:10:20,820
just listen to the DDR Freak archive, because it'll all be there.

1834
02:10:20,820 --> 02:10:24,820
Actually, I think if any of you guys are on the net, I need you to stop what you're doing,

1835
02:10:24,820 --> 02:10:27,820
stop your uploads, stop whatever you're doing, close any programs that are connected to the internet.

1836
02:10:27,820 --> 02:10:29,820
Oh, man, so much for my 6-bit torrent.

1837
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:30,820
We need all the bandwidth right now.

1838
02:10:30,820 --> 02:10:31,820
It's live 365.

1839
02:10:31,820 --> 02:10:32,820
Is it? Okay, alright.

1840
02:10:32,820 --> 02:10:36,820
We never disconnected, it's live 365, they've done this to me too.

1841
02:10:36,820 --> 02:10:41,460
It's the goddamn government, they're hacks-ering us.

1842
02:10:41,460 --> 02:10:44,520
I am showing the stations up on the air and streaming, so it's just gonna take them a

1843
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:45,700
minute to get in, so...

1844
02:10:45,700 --> 02:10:47,500
Oh my god, they shut off the monitor!

1845
02:10:47,500 --> 02:10:51,380
Let's do this, let's go, Mullet, why don't I give you a call right back, we're gonna

1846
02:10:51,380 --> 02:10:54,180
go to a music break, okay?

1847
02:10:54,180 --> 02:10:55,620
Mullet, are you still there?

1848
02:10:55,620 --> 02:10:58,020
They killed Mullet! Oh my god!

1849
02:10:58,020 --> 02:10:59,940
Okay, we're gonna go to a music break and come right back, okay?

1850
02:10:59,940 --> 02:11:01,180
I'm not dead!

1851
02:11:01,180 --> 02:11:04,700
We'll call you back.

1852
02:11:04,700 --> 02:11:13,700
Okay, so we're gonna do a music break real quick here. If you guys are with us, we're gonna go to a break here while everything is being burned and destroyed and it's awful.

1853
02:11:13,700 --> 02:11:15,700
Oh my god, the choppers!

1854
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:19,700
Oh no, the government guys with their cell phones are going to signal us to death.

1855
02:11:19,700 --> 02:11:20,700
I think I have a very-

1856
02:11:20,700 --> 02:11:21,700
Do you have any reference?

1857
02:11:21,700 --> 02:11:22,700
I have a very-

1858
02:11:22,700 --> 02:11:23,700
Cancer!

1859
02:11:23,700 --> 02:11:30,700
I have a very appropriate song for this break, too, and it's actually topical, so people reconnecting during this downtime will find this to be hilarious.

1860
02:11:30,700 --> 02:11:34,700
Perhaps though, they were just thinking that, you know, that E.T. wanted the phone home,

1861
02:11:34,700 --> 02:11:38,120
so they were just providing him with the walkie-talkie that he could do that with.

1862
02:11:38,120 --> 02:11:41,680
They were just trying to be helpful instead of hurtful as...

1863
02:11:41,680 --> 02:11:43,680
Let's take a minute, let's take a minute out and come back, okay?

1864
02:11:43,680 --> 02:11:44,680
Ah, fine.

1865
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:45,180
Stayed

1866
02:12:44,680 --> 02:12:49,680
I made you believe we're more than just friends

1867
02:12:49,680 --> 02:12:52,680
Oh baby, you might seem like a crush

1868
02:12:52,680 --> 02:12:56,680
But it doesn't mean I'm serious

1869
02:12:56,680 --> 02:13:00,680
Cause you lose all my offenses

1870
02:13:00,680 --> 02:13:03,680
That is just so typically me

1871
02:13:03,680 --> 02:13:07,680
Oh baby baby up I dig in

1872
02:13:07,680 --> 02:13:10,680
I played with your heart, got lost in a game

1873
02:13:10,680 --> 02:13:14,680
Oh, baby, baby, oh, you think I'm in love

1874
02:13:14,680 --> 02:13:17,680
That I've been from above

1875
02:13:17,680 --> 02:13:19,680
I'm not that innocent

1876
02:13:33,680 --> 02:13:36,680
Yeah, see, my problem is clear

1877
02:13:36,680 --> 02:13:38,680
I'm dreaming away

1878
02:13:38,680 --> 02:13:41,680
Where should I see you grow that you believe in?

1879
02:13:41,680 --> 02:13:43,680
I saw you watching the days

1880
02:13:43,680 --> 02:13:45,680
Can't you see I'm a fool

1881
02:13:45,680 --> 02:13:47,680
In so many ways

1882
02:13:47,680 --> 02:13:51,680
But you lose all my senses

1883
02:13:51,680 --> 02:13:54,680
That is just so typically me

1884
02:13:54,680 --> 02:13:56,680
Oh baby, ooh

1885
02:13:56,680 --> 02:13:58,680
I dig in

1886
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:00,680
I play with your heart

1887
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,680
Got lost in the game

1888
02:14:02,680 --> 02:14:03,680
Oh baby, baby, ooh

1889
02:14:03,680 --> 02:14:05,680
You think I'm in love

1890
02:14:35,680 --> 02:14:50,720
Alright, we are back here on Orange Launch Radio and an appropriate choice there, we

1891
02:14:50,720 --> 02:14:55,320
played the 5th mix version of Oops I Did It Again during our little downtime there.

1892
02:14:55,320 --> 02:14:59,560
Sorry about that, I don't know what happened, I think a combination of Live 365 did a net

1893
02:14:59,560 --> 02:15:05,320
fart and then we, I was trying to launch iTunes because I was going to do a gag because El

1894
02:15:05,320 --> 02:15:08,920
Elle Mullet and I were talking about songs that we would like to see on DDR Extreme 2.

1895
02:15:08,920 --> 02:15:11,800
Hmm, surprise, an Apple product crashing.

1896
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:14,400
So actually, what I'm going to do now, I know a lot of you guys are actually calling in,

1897
02:15:14,400 --> 02:15:18,360
but I do want to give Elle Mullet a proper chance to say goodbye, so we're calling him

1898
02:15:18,360 --> 02:15:19,360
right back.

1899
02:15:19,360 --> 02:15:21,440
Hi, Elle Mullet, you there?

1900
02:15:21,440 --> 02:15:22,440
I'm here, Skye.

1901
02:15:22,440 --> 02:15:23,440
How's it going?

1902
02:15:23,440 --> 02:15:24,440
Good.

1903
02:15:24,440 --> 02:15:25,440
I think we still have a little bit of that delay, but that's okay.

1904
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:28,240
Elle Mullet, live from the Middle East.

1905
02:15:28,240 --> 02:15:32,960
So I don't know what happened there, but actually, I have to say the best comments, one of the

1906
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:36,960
The best comments I've ever seen in our chatroom came during that break.

1907
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:44,340
And somebody said, who has a dark Tetsuya said, it's the rapture.

1908
02:15:44,340 --> 02:15:47,960
Like we'd be the ones disappearing during the rapture.

1909
02:15:47,960 --> 02:15:51,140
Alright, anyway, so El Mullet.

1910
02:15:51,140 --> 02:15:55,960
In my dream fantasy extreme too, I was always going to get to, I was going to do audio clips,

1911
02:15:55,960 --> 02:15:59,020
but iTunes decided to kill my computer.

1912
02:15:59,020 --> 02:16:02,380
We have, I would have, oops I did it again, Genie in a Bottle.

1913
02:16:02,380 --> 02:16:07,380
prerogative, the New My New My A song has to be in there for sure. Vengaboys, We Like

1914
02:16:07,380 --> 02:16:13,820
to Party definitely would be in there as well. Alice DJ, Better Off Alone. Madonna, Old School

1915
02:16:13,820 --> 02:16:17,640
Madonna and New School Madonna would definitely have to be in it. And let's see, what else

1916
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:21,060
would be in there? Somebody told me, because you know that. Yeah, somebody told me that

1917
02:16:21,060 --> 02:16:24,740
you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend and all that stuff. And then we would definitely

1918
02:16:24,740 --> 02:16:30,860
have to have all of the American Idols as well. Oh my God, Winnie Clay. And Clay. Because

1919
02:16:30,860 --> 02:16:53,860
I'll tell you this, if I'm interrupting, there would be 5th Mix. It would all be 5th Mix, plus random add-ons, and it would be glorious.

1920
02:16:53,860 --> 02:16:55,860
I like the idea of DDR to speak to this.

1921
02:16:55,860 --> 02:16:58,860
The only one who would buy the copy because, well, let's face it.

1922
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:05,860
Go lag. I know, we have horrible, horrible lag tonight.

1923
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:09,860
So, oh well. Yeah, I agree with the idea that 5th Mix would rock.

1924
02:17:09,860 --> 02:17:13,860
Let's just pour it 5th Mix and let's try to get all the original versions of song too.

1925
02:17:13,860 --> 02:17:16,860
Let's give the original tribal dance and all that stuff, that'd be great.

1926
02:17:16,860 --> 02:17:19,860
But we have to have the new My New My A song in there, come on.

1927
02:17:19,860 --> 02:17:25,860
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go. This delay is horrible. Let's try this again.

1928
02:17:25,860 --> 02:17:26,860
That's right. Have a good one, Emmaulet.

1929
02:17:26,860 --> 02:17:27,860
I'm very, very, very sorry.

1930
02:17:27,860 --> 02:17:31,860
That's right. Have a good one, Emmaulet. Take care, and I'll plug it for him. Insidepulse.com

1931
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:38,860
is super-duper, so visit it. I know its song needs to be in there. What? The Muppet one.

1932
02:17:38,860 --> 02:17:39,860
Manomina.

1933
02:17:39,860 --> 02:17:40,860
Manomina.

1934
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:43,680
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-la-la-la-la-la

1935
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:45,260
hmm

1936
02:17:45,260 --> 02:17:46,940
that's in a commercial now

1937
02:17:46,940 --> 02:17:50,660
alright, we are taking calls on our sk gaining www.orangelandsradio.com

1938
02:17:50,660 --> 02:17:52,840
click on interact with us if you are interested

1939
02:17:52,840 --> 02:17:55,400
in giving us a call

1940
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:57,860
hi you're on Orangelands Radio, who's this?

1941
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:58,860
legendofzaku

1942
02:17:58,860 --> 02:18:01,620
hello legendofzaku, what's under your mind buddy?

1943
02:18:01,620 --> 02:18:05,060
well I just got a few things I managed to find I don't know I'm just

1944
02:18:05,060 --> 02:18:08,580
trying to perpetuate the rumour cycle a little bit

1945
02:18:08,580 --> 02:18:14,420
I'm posting up a link right now from a person's live journal.

1946
02:18:14,420 --> 02:18:19,340
Apparently, this is going to sound strange, but just bear with me.

1947
02:18:19,340 --> 02:18:25,580
It seems this guy who's posting on his live journal basically, you know, heard some information

1948
02:18:25,580 --> 02:18:30,980
a while back, and I mean like about maybe two or three years ago, that they were going

1949
02:18:30,980 --> 02:18:34,740
to bring back a new DDR arcade mix this year.

1950
02:18:34,740 --> 02:18:41,260
And the reason why he posted is because a second person heard about this and it wasn't

1951
02:18:41,260 --> 02:18:43,700
from the poster source.

1952
02:18:43,700 --> 02:18:44,700
Sky?

1953
02:18:44,700 --> 02:18:47,380
Yeah, no, no, I'm with you here.

1954
02:18:47,380 --> 02:18:48,380
I'm here.

1955
02:18:48,380 --> 02:18:49,380
I'm with you.

1956
02:18:49,380 --> 02:18:50,380
I'm just listening to you.

1957
02:18:50,380 --> 02:18:51,380
Yeah, but I posted up the link.

1958
02:18:51,380 --> 02:18:52,380
All right.

1959
02:18:52,380 --> 02:18:53,380
All right.

1960
02:18:53,380 --> 02:18:54,380
I'm going to look at this link.

1961
02:18:54,380 --> 02:18:55,380
Yeah.

1962
02:18:55,380 --> 02:18:56,380
That's pretty much it.

1963
02:18:56,380 --> 02:18:57,380
That's why he posted it.

1964
02:18:57,380 --> 02:18:58,380
Okay.

1965
02:18:58,380 --> 02:19:03,060
So, they said years ago that this was supposed to be the year the DDR comes back.

1966
02:19:03,060 --> 02:19:06,380
Let's see, I'm going to...

1967
02:19:06,380 --> 02:19:07,900
This comes from some guy's journal.

1968
02:19:07,900 --> 02:19:09,140
I've seen this guy around DDR3.

1969
02:19:09,140 --> 02:19:10,700
Cucumber is the name.

1970
02:19:10,700 --> 02:19:15,720
New DDR arcade makes its debut in September, rumor, rumor, rumor.

1971
02:19:15,720 --> 02:19:19,720
My first source said that an individual who has direct ties to Konami of Japan heard straight

1972
02:19:19,720 --> 02:19:24,060
from them that DDR Extreme 2 will be previewed at Tokyo Game Show in September.

1973
02:19:24,060 --> 02:19:27,660
They've supposedly changed the hardware to make the game un-bootlegable, although I doubt

1974
02:19:27,660 --> 02:19:30,340
it took since December 2002 to do that.

1975
02:19:30,340 --> 02:19:35,460
My second source said there will be a location test in October.

1976
02:19:35,460 --> 02:19:39,540
I doubt it. Whatever. I mean, honestly, I gotta tell you, Zaku, it's

1977
02:19:39,540 --> 02:19:42,820
another rumor to me. It seems like every three months somebody's got the rumor

1978
02:19:42,820 --> 02:19:46,620
they have a friend who knows Konami of Japan.

1979
02:19:46,620 --> 02:19:50,540
Yeah, but the fact that a second person found out would mean that, you know, two

1980
02:19:50,540 --> 02:19:51,780
things. A,

1981
02:19:51,780 --> 02:19:55,480
if the rumor is probably, you know, spread to some other person, or B,

1982
02:19:55,480 --> 02:19:58,820
there might be a second person who might have found a credible source. So it could go

1983
02:19:58,820 --> 02:20:03,340
either way. Well, you're right. Any of these rumors could go either way. There's tons of

1984
02:20:03,340 --> 02:20:06,280
things out there on the internet that are probably rumors now that will turn to fact

1985
02:20:06,280 --> 02:20:11,260
later on. You don't know. But I mean, I hope it's true. I would love it if this news were

1986
02:20:11,260 --> 02:20:15,500
true. I hope it's true. The un-bootlegable part is kind of sad because that means we

1987
02:20:15,500 --> 02:20:18,520
probably won't see the machines here, but something tells me we'll see them one way

1988
02:20:18,520 --> 02:20:22,860
or another. I hope it's true. I don't know if it has anything. There's no such thing

1989
02:20:22,860 --> 02:20:24,740
is un-bootlegable anything.

1990
02:20:24,740 --> 02:20:25,540
Everything's pirateable.

1991
02:20:25,540 --> 02:20:27,740
But I hope it's true.

1992
02:20:27,740 --> 02:20:31,780
And I don't know what else to say.

1993
02:20:31,780 --> 02:20:33,900
I mean, the signs are pretty clear right now.

1994
02:20:33,900 --> 02:20:36,540
Paul Eteri is saying some stuff about recording a new

1995
02:20:36,540 --> 02:20:38,420
song on Naoki.

1996
02:20:38,420 --> 02:20:41,460
And I don't know whether or not it's adding up to

1997
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:43,340
something, but it's out there.

1998
02:20:43,340 --> 02:20:48,020
It might not be true at first, but it might be something that

1999
02:20:48,020 --> 02:20:50,220
might be the basis for an official word.

2000
02:20:50,220 --> 02:20:52,520
It comes to that point.

2001
02:20:52,520 --> 02:20:56,160
I see how it also adds up together, you're right, the Politarian Naoki thing kind of

2002
02:20:56,160 --> 02:20:59,520
going along with this makes everything kind of look at up, but also you have to realize

2003
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:04,060
with three new games coming out in the U.S. this year, three new DDR games and a Karaoke

2004
02:21:04,060 --> 02:21:06,960
Revolution game, which you know, it wouldn't surprise me if Naoki ever did something for

2005
02:21:06,960 --> 02:21:12,080
that, you know, it's very possible that the Politarian thing is for one of these games.

2006
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,040
But Phil, I mean, we just have to look at the possibilities.

2007
02:21:14,040 --> 02:21:15,080
I hope you're right.

2008
02:21:15,080 --> 02:21:16,080
I hope you're right.

2009
02:21:16,080 --> 02:21:18,560
I hope this guy's right.

2010
02:21:18,560 --> 02:21:19,560
I hope I'm right.

2011
02:21:19,560 --> 02:21:45,560
I mean, I just, you know, the only thing, I don't know, maybe Konami might pull something out of their ass in E3 that might shock us all, that might shock us all, and keep, and basically surprise the hell out of us, or, you know, maybe it might be when they drop the, when they release the new DDR games, I don't know, maybe some edit mode for some future arcade mix, now that they've already, you know, now that they have, you know, USB mode working, thank you Gran Turismo 4 for that.

2012
02:21:45,560 --> 02:21:52,560
You know what, it wouldn't be an E3 if somebody doesn't drop a bombshell.

2013
02:21:52,560 --> 02:21:56,560
So, I would love it for it to be to Konami, but who knows.

2014
02:21:56,560 --> 02:22:01,560
Konami may have had it all already blown already from GamePro, thank you.

2015
02:22:01,560 --> 02:22:02,560
So, who knows?

2016
02:22:02,560 --> 02:22:07,560
Yeah, but you know, they might have saved some of the stuff that hasn't seen light yet.

2017
02:22:07,560 --> 02:22:13,560
And basically, everything's ready for them to do almost about anything beyond the home release.

2018
02:22:13,560 --> 02:22:18,760
as for saying a new arcade mix. They already have a third-party distributor up.

2019
02:22:18,760 --> 02:22:23,560
I don't know, it shouldn't be that hard to add USB slots to replace the memory card slots.

2020
02:22:23,560 --> 02:22:24,560
You know what? I'm glad you brought the...

2021
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:27,060
And the Gran Turismo 4 is probably the first thing to...

2022
02:22:27,060 --> 02:22:30,060
I'm glad you brought the USB thing up, because I'll tell you what.

2023
02:22:30,060 --> 02:22:36,060
One thing that is really getting me into In the Groove in the arcade is the USB support.

2024
02:22:36,060 --> 02:22:40,560
It is phenomenal. I actually picked up a jump drive so I could check out what this does.

2025
02:22:40,560 --> 02:22:44,360
i'll tell you what the in the group u s b support damn near sells that game to

2026
02:22:44,360 --> 02:22:44,800
me

2027
02:22:44,800 --> 02:22:49,080
it is it is that good dot u s b support is because not all that game almost as

2028
02:22:49,080 --> 02:22:51,280
good as that mean a u s b

2029
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:54,880
i'm sorry that's the same damn thing i don't think that but this is something

2030
02:22:54,880 --> 02:22:58,360
that actually in the arcades you know i mean it's different it's not

2031
02:22:58,360 --> 02:22:59,240
shut up

2032
02:22:59,240 --> 02:23:02,440
i won't be surprised that can only do that in for the

2033
02:23:02,440 --> 02:23:05,560
for further you know if they did they decided to continue my here in the

2034
02:23:05,560 --> 02:23:08,880
arcades are not me should have minds in their game and

2035
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:11,400
and show the in-the-groove folks how it feels

2036
02:23:11,400 --> 02:23:16,500
except they won't be mines, they'll be super bad steps, or they'll be bombs or

2037
02:23:16,500 --> 02:23:21,660
something, you know? And take it to the in-the-groove folks and let them know how it feels a little bit, but don't

2038
02:23:21,660 --> 02:23:23,360
take the hand-plants idea

2039
02:23:23,360 --> 02:23:26,880
leave it in that other game

2040
02:23:26,880 --> 02:23:30,320
Konami has the ability to wipe them out for all they care

2041
02:23:30,320 --> 02:23:32,060
but you know, they're just waiting

2042
02:23:32,060 --> 02:23:34,480
they're waiting to see how in-the-groove does

2043
02:23:34,480 --> 02:23:38,480
and then they'll probably, you know, they'll probably bring out their big guns, just to hold on to

2044
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:41,880
their market that's my prediction right there well we will see it if that's

2045
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:44,880
they're playing the waiting game it's gonna be it's only do it's gonna be a

2046
02:23:44,880 --> 02:23:48,300
very interesting e3 I would I would love nothing more than for Konami and red

2047
02:23:48,300 --> 02:23:51,400
octane to be right across from each other but we know what happened yes

2048
02:23:51,400 --> 02:23:55,640
rivals just holding fists like like like as if you know like a Mortal Kombat

2049
02:23:55,640 --> 02:24:00,800
versus green you know what though despite despite anything negative I've

2050
02:24:00,800 --> 02:24:05,760
said about in the groove in the past competition benefits all of us in the

2051
02:24:05,760 --> 02:24:10,640
long run. So, I think that's it right there. Competition will benefit us all.

2052
02:24:10,640 --> 02:24:18,440
That basically spurs innovation. Alright, I'm cutting you off now, Zaku. Closing time.

2053
02:24:18,440 --> 02:24:22,400
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here, buddy. Alright, bye.

2054
02:24:22,400 --> 02:24:26,360
Nice quote of a song there. You're right. Thank you.

2055
02:24:26,360 --> 02:24:33,000
What, what, what, what? I have a cousin who knows a guy, who knows a girl, who's dating

2056
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:39,040
a guy who knows somebody at Konami. No, get this, okay, this is great. The new arcade

2057
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:41,640
system, it's going to have this little thing in the background. It's actually going to

2058
02:24:41,640 --> 02:24:47,140
be like some sort of score Italian thing. If you do really good in it, you get contacted

2059
02:24:47,140 --> 02:24:55,400
by aliens that actually take you up in their starship to go serve other aliens, all like

2060
02:24:55,400 --> 02:25:02,120
the last star fighter. It's fucking awesome. Konami is taking on the universe, man. Loki,

2061
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:06,120
Okay, shut up. We got another call. You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

2062
02:25:06,120 --> 02:25:09,120
Hello?

2063
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:13,120
Hi. Did you have to talk to your mom there in the background or something?

2064
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:16,120
It sounded like you were talking to somebody in the background.

2065
02:25:16,120 --> 02:25:18,120
No, that was just someone else.

2066
02:25:18,120 --> 02:25:22,120
Hi, someone else. Alright, what's up? What's on your mind?

2067
02:25:22,120 --> 02:25:27,120
Actually, the first question I have is about the After Printer Pad.

2068
02:25:27,120 --> 02:25:28,120
Okay.

2069
02:25:28,120 --> 02:25:43,120
I mean originally I was going to get the bundle for In the Groove with the ignition pad, but now, I mean, I saw all these screenshots that you guys showed, and you say it's probably, you know, like the best metal pad to get, for the Cobalt Flux at least.

2070
02:25:43,120 --> 02:25:45,120
I haven't played Cobalt Flux, so I can't give an opinion on that.

2071
02:25:45,120 --> 02:25:47,120
I'm just going to save it a little bit and save up more money.

2072
02:25:47,120 --> 02:25:50,120
I'll tell you what, have you...

2073
02:25:50,120 --> 02:25:52,120
I'm wondering if I should just save up.

2074
02:25:52,120 --> 02:25:57,040
Well, okay, I have a Cobalt Flux and I just played on the afterburner.

2075
02:25:57,040 --> 02:26:00,640
I would honestly rather save the hundred dollars than just play on the afterburner.

2076
02:26:00,640 --> 02:26:03,440
I actually prefer the afterburner over the Cobalt Flux.

2077
02:26:03,440 --> 02:26:07,480
I actually, we also got to play on ignition 3.0, which is basically the new ignition.

2078
02:26:07,480 --> 02:26:11,880
It's just now they've taken the D, the arrows, and they've D-DDR'd them, and they're just

2079
02:26:11,880 --> 02:26:14,760
these generic orange arrows now, and also has USB support.

2080
02:26:14,760 --> 02:26:19,080
The ignition 3.0 honestly did nothing for me that ignition 2.0 didn't already do.

2081
02:26:19,080 --> 02:26:23,720
So Ignition 3.0 is the exact same as all the other Ignitions they put out, but After Burner,

2082
02:26:23,720 --> 02:26:28,720
if you've got the money to drop, you really have to evaluate, how much will I use this

2083
02:26:28,720 --> 02:26:30,720
thing?

2084
02:26:30,720 --> 02:26:33,980
If you think you're going to use it a lot, it's something you're going to play every

2085
02:26:33,980 --> 02:26:37,560
day or every other day, make a part of your exercise routine, yes, I say it's worth the

2086
02:26:37,560 --> 02:26:38,560
money.

2087
02:26:38,560 --> 02:26:42,640
But if you honestly evaluate how much you play DDR, and see, for somebody like me, even

2088
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:46,040
though I talk a lot about DDR, how much do I actually go play it at home?

2089
02:26:46,040 --> 02:26:47,880
I don't actually play at home a whole lot.

2090
02:26:47,880 --> 02:26:52,240
I prefer to go to the arcades. So for me, I don't see the point in getting a metal stage.

2091
02:26:52,240 --> 02:26:56,720
I would rather have the ignition pad because it's not worth it to me. But if you don't

2092
02:26:56,720 --> 02:27:00,240
get to play DDR in the arcades a lot or whatever, and you think you're going to play this a

2093
02:27:00,240 --> 02:27:02,960
lot at home, I say go for it. You won't regret it.

2094
02:27:02,960 --> 02:27:08,760
Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't get to play in this much in arcades, so that's what I'm

2095
02:27:08,760 --> 02:27:09,760
thinking about.

2096
02:27:09,760 --> 02:27:10,760
All right.

2097
02:27:10,760 --> 02:27:14,600
But then again, I'm thinking how long does it last?

2098
02:27:14,600 --> 02:27:19,600
You know, that's a good question. I don't know, I'm not Red Octane, but I know it took

2099
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:25,060
a lot of abuse in the groove night. People were playing with shoes on and heels and everything

2100
02:27:25,060 --> 02:27:28,220
and playing the crazy songs and it seemed to hold up.

2101
02:27:28,220 --> 02:27:31,840
The arrows are not acrylic. I'm pretty sure there's some form of plexiglass, so they're

2102
02:27:31,840 --> 02:27:35,180
not going to smash if you step on them 20 times.

2103
02:27:35,180 --> 02:27:39,840
So I just, I don't know though, but you have to look at, I've had ignition pads that die

2104
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:43,280
after six to nine months, so I'm hoping it's not the same thing with the afterburner, especially

2105
02:27:43,280 --> 02:27:46,180
considering that kind of investment but unfortunately until these things hit the

2106
02:27:46,180 --> 02:27:49,520
market we won't know how long they really last so nobody can really say

2107
02:27:49,520 --> 02:27:53,200
it's you're taking a little bit of a gamble I would say if red octane has

2108
02:27:53,200 --> 02:27:57,660
some reasonable type and I'm not familiar with red octane directly I've

2109
02:27:57,660 --> 02:28:01,680
always bought their products in stores when I bought their products but if they

2110
02:28:01,680 --> 02:28:05,480
have some type of warranty replacement program as long as it's reasonable I say

2111
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:08,760
go for it you never because you don't know how long these things gonna last

2112
02:28:08,760 --> 02:28:12,120
Yeah, yeah, right. I'll probably get it then, thanks.

2113
02:28:12,120 --> 02:28:15,480
Alright, no problem. Anything else for us?

2114
02:28:15,480 --> 02:28:20,960
Probably. I mean, I have a lot of opinions now in the group since I actually finally got to play it last week.

2115
02:28:20,960 --> 02:28:22,280
Alright, what do you think?

2116
02:28:22,280 --> 02:28:25,480
So, I mean, it's pretty interesting. Like,

2117
02:28:25,480 --> 02:28:28,920
I don't like how it's such a...

2118
02:28:28,920 --> 02:28:32,560
It's not as varied as DDR is with the music,

2119
02:28:32,560 --> 02:28:37,720
which is probably my biggest problem. But otherwise, it looks pretty good. I mean,

2120
02:28:37,720 --> 02:28:40,720
I mean, the difficulty is really hard, but whatever.

2121
02:28:40,720 --> 02:28:41,720
Yeah, yeah.

2122
02:28:41,720 --> 02:28:45,720
I'm willing to dish out money for the home version anyway just for something new to play.

2123
02:28:45,720 --> 02:28:48,720
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's what, going to be what, 30 bucks, I think?

2124
02:28:48,720 --> 02:28:50,720
I don't know, don't quote me on that, 40 at most.

2125
02:28:50,720 --> 02:28:51,720
Yeah.

2126
02:28:51,720 --> 02:28:52,720
And you get a t-shirt.

2127
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:53,720
Yeah.

2128
02:28:53,720 --> 02:28:56,720
Whatever, it'll, you know.

2129
02:28:56,720 --> 02:28:57,720
A keychain.

2130
02:28:57,720 --> 02:29:01,720
People that are dedicated to these games enough to be tuning into this show are probably not

2131
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:03,720
going to regret the purchase, honestly.

2132
02:29:03,720 --> 02:29:05,720
Just go for it.

2133
02:29:05,720 --> 02:29:06,720
Yeah, definitely.

2134
02:29:06,720 --> 02:29:10,800
definitely. Alright, well I'm gonna let you go so we can take some more calls, but thanks for calling in, alright?

2135
02:29:10,800 --> 02:29:13,860
There will be a day where I will... Alright, have a good one, buddy.

2136
02:29:13,860 --> 02:29:17,360
...review in the group someday. Goodbye. Alright,

2137
02:29:17,360 --> 02:29:21,360
let's take one more call here. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

2138
02:29:21,360 --> 02:29:24,880
Hey guys. Hello, is this Angel?

2139
02:29:24,880 --> 02:29:28,040
Yep. What's on your mind? You're not here tonight.

2140
02:29:28,040 --> 02:29:32,560
I know. What's going on? Sicker than crap.

2141
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:36,480
Oh, sorry to hear it. Well, I know that you

2142
02:29:36,480 --> 02:29:40,600
feel better, first off, rest up and feel better. What did you think, because you had to go to the

2143
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:44,040
in the group party because I had to beg somebody to go with me because Jamie had

2144
02:29:44,040 --> 02:29:44,680
to,

2145
02:29:44,680 --> 02:29:48,520
Matt had to work and Jamie had the school thing, so I was begging Live Journal and you

2146
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:52,320
took it up, so you had to go, what did you think?

2147
02:29:52,320 --> 02:29:55,880
I thought it was awesome. It's going to give me something to do,

2148
02:29:55,880 --> 02:30:00,240
you know, while I'm waiting for Extreme

2149
02:30:00,240 --> 02:30:04,640
2 and Ultra Mix 3, so it's just going to be a filler

2150
02:30:04,640 --> 02:30:07,760
And, you know, I like both games differently.

2151
02:30:07,760 --> 02:30:10,160
You know, I like DDR for DDR, and I like, you know,

2152
02:30:10,160 --> 02:30:11,200
In the Groove for In the Groove.

2153
02:30:11,200 --> 02:30:14,520
So I'm not going to sit there and knock it, because, I mean,

2154
02:30:14,520 --> 02:30:17,240
I'm still getting exercise, and I'm still liking the music

2155
02:30:17,240 --> 02:30:22,920
that, you know, either game offers, so, you know.

2156
02:30:22,920 --> 02:30:24,760
I think that's a very fair way to look at it.

2157
02:30:24,760 --> 02:30:25,280
You know what?

2158
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:28,800
It's just, bitch and cry and moan all you want.

2159
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:31,800
Both these games are out there, and they're going to be

2160
02:30:31,800 --> 02:30:34,520
available, so why not eat them up and just enjoy what both

2161
02:30:34,520 --> 02:30:36,520
games have to offer.

2162
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:39,440
And I'm glad that you guys liked the After Burner, because

2163
02:30:39,440 --> 02:30:42,600
I wanted to try it, but I was just not wearing the right

2164
02:30:42,600 --> 02:30:44,160
shoes that day.

2165
02:30:44,160 --> 02:30:47,440
So I was just like, eh, I don't want to kill myself.

2166
02:30:47,440 --> 02:30:52,880
So I might actually end up buying that with the games.

2167
02:30:52,880 --> 02:30:54,240
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

2168
02:30:54,240 --> 02:30:55,800
Oh, and you forgot.

2169
02:30:55,800 --> 02:30:58,920
Yeah, yeah, Angel?

2170
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:03,720
You forgot the little spoof about you and the bar when the

2171
02:31:03,720 --> 02:31:07,720
I was trying to play. That was pretty funny when we already did the press room.

2172
02:31:07,720 --> 02:31:12,720
Oh, God, that's right. Okay, remember this? Okay, because they took the stool away from

2173
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:17,720
Tody, what I ended up doing when we were in the media room is you decided you were going

2174
02:31:17,720 --> 02:31:22,520
to play some insane song. So I was like, here, hold on to my hand, and you can use my hand

2175
02:31:22,520 --> 02:31:24,720
as the bar. And he did it. It worked.

2176
02:31:24,720 --> 02:31:27,400
This is how people are going to have to do it at home. He held on to my hand, not in

2177
02:31:27,400 --> 02:31:31,360
a homosexual way, but he held on to my hand as the bar, and he played, and it actually

2178
02:31:31,360 --> 02:31:36,440
Well the guys that whoever was dancing next to you. I didn't know him, but you um. I think his name is Andres

2179
02:31:36,440 --> 02:31:41,360
I'm Oregon okay. Well. He did the same thing and I actually snapped a picture of it

2180
02:31:41,360 --> 02:31:47,360
Yeah, somebody commented on the website about that like do is somebody using a hand as the bar yes because we and I would like

2181
02:31:47,360 --> 02:31:49,620
To say that was my idea copyright. It was my idea

2182
02:31:50,720 --> 02:31:52,720
patent pending great

2183
02:31:53,280 --> 02:32:00,040
All right anyway, huh? I had a pirate and hide everyone there. I'm sorry. I'm not there, but hey yeah feel better

2184
02:32:00,040 --> 02:32:04,040
I take it we're not meeting at CCL on Tuesday.

2185
02:32:04,040 --> 02:32:08,040
Actually, I think we are. Talk to your girlfriend.

2186
02:32:08,040 --> 02:32:10,040
Okay. Alright, will do.

2187
02:32:10,040 --> 02:32:12,040
Alright, have a good one, Angel. Thanks for calling.

2188
02:32:12,040 --> 02:32:13,040
Alright, bye guys.

2189
02:32:13,040 --> 02:32:14,040
Bye.

2190
02:32:14,040 --> 02:32:15,040
Have a good one.

2191
02:32:15,040 --> 02:32:17,040
I was arm raping. It was pretty hot.

2192
02:32:17,040 --> 02:32:18,040
It was hot.

2193
02:32:18,040 --> 02:32:23,040
One other thing I got to say. I noticed, because sometimes I look at people chatting on different forums,

2194
02:32:23,040 --> 02:32:26,720
How many different places did you say Rob took

2195
02:32:26,720 --> 02:32:31,280
three pictures of my ass and put them on the Orange Lounge radio gallery for you all to see?

2196
02:32:31,280 --> 02:32:35,720
I think I put it on like two different places. It was on my live journal and then

2197
02:32:35,720 --> 02:32:40,000
I know I commented on the Orange Lounge site. That might have been it.

2198
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:43,160
It just seemed like everywhere I was reading you said something about, God, Rob takes

2199
02:32:43,160 --> 02:32:44,400
all these pictures of my ass.

2200
02:32:44,400 --> 02:32:50,000
Well, I mean, it is a nice ass. It doesn't even exist. I don't even have one at my body weight.

2201
02:32:50,000 --> 02:32:55,000
You know what, I was just trying to get pictures of hamplants because I was actually going to do something with like no ham.

2202
02:32:55,000 --> 02:32:56,000
I don't believe you.

2203
02:32:56,000 --> 02:32:57,000
You're right, it was all about your ass.

2204
02:32:57,000 --> 02:32:58,000
Alright.

2205
02:32:58,000 --> 02:32:59,000
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

2206
02:32:59,000 --> 02:33:00,000
Person on Skype line.

2207
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:05,000
Greetings from New York, it's the one and only Ronma.

2208
02:33:05,000 --> 02:33:06,000
How you guys doing?

2209
02:33:06,000 --> 02:33:07,000
Good, how are you Ronma?

2210
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:08,000
What's on your mind?

2211
02:33:08,000 --> 02:33:09,000
Pretty good.

2212
02:33:09,000 --> 02:33:15,000
I want to give you my quick anime boss review wrap up in like a few minutes.

2213
02:33:15,000 --> 02:33:18,000
Make it really, really, really quick because you're actually breaking up a little bit.

2214
02:33:18,000 --> 02:33:23,000
Your voice is breaking there, so make it quick.

2215
02:33:23,000 --> 02:33:25,000
Crap, I'm going to make it really quick.

2216
02:33:25,000 --> 02:33:28,000
Anime Boss was great, I'm going to play Didi of Forever.

2217
02:33:28,000 --> 02:33:31,000
The Tokyo Game Action Guy, say hi.

2218
02:33:31,000 --> 02:33:32,000
The masquerade kind of sucked.

2219
02:33:32,000 --> 02:33:37,000
It seems if you made your own costume, but you wore shoes, you automatically got disqualified.

2220
02:33:37,000 --> 02:33:41,000
What? You wore shoes? You got disqualified? What the hell?

2221
02:33:41,000 --> 02:33:43,000
Whatever.

2222
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:44,000
Well, you know what?

2223
02:33:44,000 --> 02:33:47,440
I actually, we need to get out to some anime cons and get our name out there some more.

2224
02:33:47,440 --> 02:33:48,440
Go into Kaname.

2225
02:33:48,440 --> 02:33:49,440
I need to go or something.

2226
02:33:49,440 --> 02:33:50,440
We need to get a little room.

2227
02:33:50,440 --> 02:33:51,840
I want to travel to the East Coast.

2228
02:33:51,840 --> 02:33:54,040
Some East Coast person, fly us out there.

2229
02:33:54,040 --> 02:33:56,200
We'll do a table thing or whatever.

2230
02:33:56,200 --> 02:33:57,200
It'll be fun.

2231
02:33:57,200 --> 02:34:02,240
Dude, if y'all fly out to East Coast, y'all can stay in my room for free.

2232
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:05,560
I just, you promise not to take advantage of us, right?

2233
02:34:05,560 --> 02:34:06,560
Never.

2234
02:34:06,560 --> 02:34:07,560
All right.

2235
02:34:07,560 --> 02:34:08,560
Sounds good.

2236
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:09,560
Well, thank you.

2237
02:34:09,560 --> 02:34:10,560
Should I get an opportunity to cosplay?

2238
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,560
Yeah.

2239
02:34:11,560 --> 02:34:12,560
Thank you for the offer.

2240
02:34:12,560 --> 02:34:13,560
We appreciate it.

2241
02:34:13,560 --> 02:34:16,920
Anyway, buddy, because you're kind of breaking up, I'm going to let you go.

2242
02:34:16,920 --> 02:34:19,040
But have a good one, okay?

2243
02:34:19,040 --> 02:34:20,040
You too.

2244
02:34:20,040 --> 02:34:21,040
All right.

2245
02:34:21,040 --> 02:34:22,040
Bye.

2246
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:23,040
All right.

2247
02:34:23,040 --> 02:34:24,040
We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line for now.

2248
02:34:24,040 --> 02:34:25,040
Sorry for you guys who weren't able to get in.

2249
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:28,320
It's just very, very, very, very crowded tonight.

2250
02:34:28,320 --> 02:34:31,200
We're going to go to a quick break because I have to go to the restroom.

2251
02:34:31,200 --> 02:34:33,640
And when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

2252
02:34:33,640 --> 02:34:37,680
So you can start sending those in to Skye in the chat room, and we'll get to those.

2253
02:34:37,680 --> 02:34:40,400
But please, please, you have to keep them quick tonight.

2254
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:43,200
They will get cut off if they're too long.

2255
02:34:43,200 --> 02:34:47,600
So we'll be back with the FUs of the week.

2256
02:34:47,600 --> 02:34:51,520
And in this break, I figure we can do some 2DX music, because we're kind of neglecting

2257
02:34:51,520 --> 02:34:52,600
Beat Media tonight.

2258
02:34:52,600 --> 02:34:56,960
So let's do, I want to hear Daisuke, because that song's cool.

2259
02:34:56,960 --> 02:35:00,760
And then I'll throw in some Taku for Jamie, because I know she likes that stuff.

2260
02:35:00,760 --> 02:35:02,900
So we'll just make it a two-song break.

2261
02:35:02,900 --> 02:35:09,900
And then we'll come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

2262
02:35:32,900 --> 02:35:35,900
I brought you a super city boy

2263
02:35:37,900 --> 02:35:41,900
Imagine that you're a godfather, you were free for me

2264
02:35:43,900 --> 02:35:46,900
Every day was dying, now I've become a god

2265
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:49,900
Every night I'm dreaming of falling in my dreams

2266
02:35:49,900 --> 02:35:52,900
I can't feel no love, I'm on my own

2267
02:35:52,900 --> 02:35:56,900
I love my class, but they're more pretty

2268
02:35:56,900 --> 02:35:59,900
Will you tell me no? How do you feel me?

2269
02:35:59,900 --> 02:36:03,900
Will you show me now? I wanna dance with you all

2270
02:36:03,900 --> 02:36:08,900
Like now, I want to walk for you Everytime, everywhere

2271
02:36:08,900 --> 02:36:12,900
Are we sure we got your own best love?

2272
02:36:42,900 --> 02:36:46,900
Will you show me now, I wanna dance with you all

2273
02:36:46,900 --> 02:36:49,400
Like now, I want to walk for you

2274
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:52,400
Everytime, everywhere

2275
02:36:52,400 --> 02:36:56,400
I wish I would get to hold this love

2276
02:36:56,400 --> 02:36:58,400
Daddy's a cat

2277
02:38:56,400 --> 02:39:00,400
Gah... Gah... Gah... Gah...

2278
02:39:00,400 --> 02:39:04,400
Gah... Gah... Gah...

2279
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:36,400
I know

2280
02:40:34,400 --> 02:40:52,320
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

2281
02:40:52,320 --> 02:41:01,200
is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

2282
02:41:01,200 --> 02:41:07,840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and now it's time for that part of the show where

2283
02:41:07,840 --> 02:41:12,080
we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the Week, which by the way, we have

2284
02:41:12,080 --> 02:41:14,640
new background music for tonight, all of us.

2285
02:41:14,640 --> 02:41:15,640
Yay!

2286
02:41:15,640 --> 02:41:16,640
I already missed my old one.

2287
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:19,680
If you were getting sick of those songs, well, you know I could start it off with your old

2288
02:41:19,680 --> 02:41:23,360
one and then get into the new one, because I do kind of like the way it started, but,

2289
02:41:23,360 --> 02:41:24,360
you know.

2290
02:41:24,360 --> 02:41:25,360
This one starts off and changes.

2291
02:41:25,360 --> 02:41:26,360
Alright, we'll do that.

2292
02:41:26,360 --> 02:41:30,960
Um, okay, so, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every single week, Dark Shark, right?

2293
02:41:30,960 --> 02:41:32,960
Fuck it

2294
02:41:46,680 --> 02:41:48,680
My F you goes toward

2295
02:41:49,760 --> 02:41:55,520
This little insurance company. It's bumpy ITT le and when I first looked at it

2296
02:41:55,520 --> 02:42:01,520
Well, no, I was saying maybe it's a title and they misspelled it, but no.

2297
02:42:01,520 --> 02:42:11,520
Anyway, and actually I transferred from person to person, then to another claims company, then to another claims company here in Sacramento.

2298
02:42:11,520 --> 02:42:17,520
And it's just been stupid. He calls me and says, call me back, blah, blah, blah.

2299
02:42:17,520 --> 02:42:20,520
So I leave him two fucking messages and he never calls me back, the bastard.

2300
02:42:20,520 --> 02:42:26,520
So, I'm going to have to wait again to find out when I get my damn money to fix my damn car.

2301
02:42:26,520 --> 02:42:32,520
Um, my fiance was supposed to hammer my, uh, fender back into place so that I could at least drive it.

2302
02:42:32,520 --> 02:42:33,520
No, it rained.

2303
02:42:33,520 --> 02:42:35,520
Sorry!

2304
02:42:35,520 --> 02:42:39,520
Um, you know, I just really miss having a car.

2305
02:42:39,520 --> 02:42:43,520
I feel like, like my left arm's been cut off.

2306
02:42:43,520 --> 02:42:47,520
You know, you can function without a left arm, but it fucking sucks.

2307
02:42:47,520 --> 02:42:49,520
And that's how I feel.

2308
02:42:49,520 --> 02:43:02,520
Um, uh, apart from that, um, you know, fuck the people who have no sense of adventure and don't like anything new.

2309
02:43:02,520 --> 02:43:05,520
Because we don't fucking give it a chance!

2310
02:43:05,520 --> 02:43:07,520
Okay, I'm done.

2311
02:43:07,520 --> 02:43:10,520
And now we move on to Loki.

2312
02:43:10,520 --> 02:43:17,520
I love this song.

2313
02:43:40,520 --> 02:43:47,520
I bought new, cheaper cartridges, and I also got a program for free that locks the cartridge

2314
02:44:10,520 --> 02:44:19,040
and the value so that it will just work until it's done. Also, fuck you to stupid people

2315
02:44:19,040 --> 02:44:23,820
driving your cars, because for some reason you just don't understand what that stupid

2316
02:44:23,820 --> 02:44:28,300
little flashy light is that's on the corner of your cars. Guess what? It's a turn signal.

2317
02:44:28,300 --> 02:44:33,580
People use it to signal when they're changing lanes. Maybe you should learn how to do that.

2318
02:44:33,580 --> 02:44:39,600
Thank you. And, um, fuck you to Ridley Scott for wasting two and a half hours of my life

2319
02:44:39,600 --> 02:44:44,940
with a crappy movie called Kingdom of Heaven. Should have known that it was going to suck

2320
02:44:44,940 --> 02:44:50,040
when the word heaven was in the title, but you know what? Guess what? The movie sucked.

2321
02:44:50,040 --> 02:44:54,860
It's basically if you took all the battles from Lord of the Rings and made them anticlimactic,

2322
02:44:54,860 --> 02:45:04,580
that would be the movie. Enjoy. It sucked. And then finally, fuck you to the really crappy

2323
02:45:04,580 --> 02:45:14,580
The first party I had in Final Fantasy XI, I've been, like, not playing for, like, a while now, and I finally got back in the plane, and the first thing I get is a party that lasts for two battles, and then is over.

2324
02:45:14,580 --> 02:45:19,580
Fucking. Sucked. Ass.

2325
02:45:19,580 --> 02:45:31,580
And then, um, finally, um, fuck you to Fox for having Family Guy at eight o'clock, because I want to watch it, and I'm going to miss it.

2326
02:45:31,580 --> 02:45:37,580
You know what? Some of us aren't reliant on television for our source of entertainment.

2327
02:46:01,580 --> 02:46:06,580
I was like, I hit the point where I'm like, I don't want to do anything at all, ever, except stay at home and lie in bed all day.

2328
02:46:06,580 --> 02:46:09,580
So that's kind of the weekend I have, so F you to laziness.

2329
02:46:09,580 --> 02:46:18,580
F you to the fact that we were a little bit disorganized in making E3 plans, so we're kind of stuck in a not-so-great hotel, but that's alright, because at least we're going, so I'm very happy about that.

2330
02:46:18,580 --> 02:46:21,580
By the way, I am going, for sure. Absolutely. By the way, I forgot to tell you.

2331
02:46:21,580 --> 02:46:22,580
Thanks.

2332
02:46:22,580 --> 02:46:23,580
I found out.

2333
02:46:23,580 --> 02:46:26,580
And maybe this time, the hooker will see Brad again.

2334
02:46:26,580 --> 02:46:28,580
Yeah, that would be great.

2335
02:46:28,580 --> 02:46:31,220
So let's see is that about it?

2336
02:46:31,220 --> 02:46:34,420
I mean if you do the fact that I have not one not two

2337
02:46:34,420 --> 02:46:40,060
But three classes to teach next week and one of them is on a Saturday f you to working on Saturdays

2338
02:46:40,060 --> 02:46:41,940
That's a horrible horrible fate

2339
02:46:41,940 --> 02:46:46,040
That anybody who works a Monday through Friday age five job should I have to do is working Saturday?

2340
02:46:46,620 --> 02:46:49,820
Amen to that I did that last week so f you to Saturday working

2341
02:46:49,820 --> 02:46:53,740
But then I get the whole next week off, so I guess I can't bitch too much. What can I say?

2342
02:46:53,740 --> 02:47:00,740
Alright, let's go over to Tody and find out Tody's FUs for tonight.

2343
02:47:00,780 --> 02:47:06,180

2344
02:47:06,180 --> 02:47:11,940

2345
02:47:11,940 --> 02:47:17,840
like ten blocks down streets that don't make me make a left hand turn just to get to a

2346
02:47:17,840 --> 02:47:24,240
parking garage that charges me $11 for like three hours and five minutes kiss

2347

2351
02:48:14,920 --> 02:48:21,280

a discreet math final I have to take tomorrow morning. F you to nearly killing my old ignition

2376
02:50:21,820 --> 02:50:26,060
pad when repairing it, only to make the fixed arrows a lot more stiffer. At least I still

2377
02:50:26,060 --> 02:50:29,460
have my Uber Elite BNS ignition pad. And F you to moving back home and having to put

2378
02:50:29,460 --> 02:50:33,140
up with dial-up again, meaning I won't be listening to your show or be on Skype for

2379
02:50:33,140 --> 02:50:36,740
that matter till I either get back on campus in the fall or get broadband this

2380
02:50:36,740 --> 02:50:42,380
and he got cut off but I'm saying I'm assuming it's summer a dark Tetsuya

2381
02:50:42,380 --> 02:50:45,540
says f you to sure West our phone line has been in and out of commission the

2382
02:50:45,540 --> 02:50:51,380
past few days thus limiting my internet and lastly dark night says my f you is

2383
02:50:51,380 --> 02:50:58,820
to depression end of line oh and f you to being broken not having a car the end

2384
02:50:58,820 --> 02:51:02,020
And you guys are so angsty.

2385
02:51:02,020 --> 02:51:03,020
We must talk.

2386
02:51:03,020 --> 02:51:04,020
I'm proud.

2387
02:51:04,020 --> 02:51:05,020
I'm proud.

2388
02:51:05,020 --> 02:51:06,020
We must talk about something.

2389
02:51:06,020 --> 02:51:07,020
Okay, what, Logie?

2390
02:51:07,020 --> 02:51:08,020
What's up?

2391
02:51:08,020 --> 02:51:09,020
Well, we didn't talk about Red Octane's...

2392
02:51:09,020 --> 02:51:10,020
We didn't!

2393
02:51:10,020 --> 02:51:11,020
I was just about to get to it.

2394
02:51:11,020 --> 02:51:12,020
If you'd hold on.

2395
02:51:12,020 --> 02:51:14,140
Oh, I don't know where you're going.

2396
02:51:14,140 --> 02:51:15,140
There's no set plan.

2397
02:51:15,140 --> 02:51:16,140
Yeah, you're right.

2398
02:51:16,140 --> 02:51:19,340
That's the wonderful thing about this show is that there's no set plan.

2399
02:51:19,340 --> 02:51:23,020
Orange Lounge Radio, no set plan.

2400
02:51:23,020 --> 02:51:25,460
Orange Lounge Radio and the Bush presidency.

2401
02:51:25,460 --> 02:51:33,660
to see. Eh, we don't have a plan. Alright, Guitar Hero is the new game that Red Octane

2402
02:51:33,660 --> 02:51:36,540
announced this week, but this is interesting because we're not sure to what extent they

2403
02:51:36,540 --> 02:51:41,440
actually meant to announce this, because they actually ended up taking down their website

2404
02:51:41,440 --> 02:51:46,020
for it, so they're kind of trying to pretend it didn't exist. I think it's one of those

2405
02:51:46,020 --> 02:51:51,540
cases where it was an E3 surprise. It was supposed to be a surprise at E3, and surprise!

2406
02:51:51,540 --> 02:51:58,540
somebody leaked your website out, so now the whole internet knows about it, so oh well.

2407
02:51:58,540 --> 02:52:03,580
Red Octane is going to be doing Guitar Hero for PlayStation 2 in the fall of this year.

2408
02:52:03,580 --> 02:52:08,980
It's interesting, by the way, to note that Red Octane for a long time, and I don't know

2409
02:52:08,980 --> 02:52:13,820
if they still are, but at least I know previously when the Guitar Freaks games were big on PlayStation

2410
02:52:13,820 --> 02:52:19,400
2, they were doing five-button guitar controllers that were for use with the Guitar Freaks.

2411
02:52:19,400 --> 02:52:22,160
So it's very interesting that, um, you know, they're doing this.

2412
02:52:22,160 --> 02:52:24,920
Is this a game to try and promote sales of those controllers?

2413
02:52:24,920 --> 02:52:26,420
Or will it be a whole new controller?

2414
02:52:26,420 --> 02:52:27,640
We don't know just yet.

2415
02:52:27,640 --> 02:52:30,440
But I do know a lot of people have bitched about the fact that there have been no new

2416
02:52:30,440 --> 02:52:31,860
Guitar Freak games.

2417
02:52:31,860 --> 02:52:35,500
And not to say that this game is going to be a Guitar Freaks clone, we don't know, but

2418
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:36,960
we can kind of, you know.

2419
02:52:36,960 --> 02:52:42,200
Basing my judgement only on their website and just how it looked, they put a lot of

2420
02:52:42,200 --> 02:52:46,560
detail on that website, and if that's the amount of detail in the game, it should be

2421
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:47,560
really good.

2422
02:52:47,560 --> 02:52:48,560
Well here's what's interesting.

2423
02:52:48,560 --> 02:52:50,920
guys that are assuming that because Red Octane is putting

2424
02:52:50,920 --> 02:52:53,720
it out means it's going to be like in the groove, you'd be

2425
02:52:53,720 --> 02:52:56,600
wrong, because harmonics is actually the focus of

2426
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:57,840
development in this game.

2427
02:52:57,840 --> 02:53:02,080
Harmonics did in, or I almost said in the groove, frequency

2428
02:53:02,080 --> 02:53:05,760
and amplitude, and they helped with karaoke revolution.

2429
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:07,320
And what else did they do?

2430
02:53:07,320 --> 02:53:09,280
There's another big one I'm not thinking of.

2431
02:53:09,280 --> 02:53:11,760
But harmonics, you know, they put out, frequency and

2432
02:53:11,760 --> 02:53:14,320
amplitude especially were games that kind of were

2433
02:53:14,320 --> 02:53:15,240
underrated.

2434
02:53:15,240 --> 02:53:16,760
So it would be very interesting to see what they

2435
02:53:16,760 --> 02:53:17,680
come up with for this.

2436
02:53:17,680 --> 02:53:20,040
Plus, they must have their own studio or something,

2437
02:53:20,040 --> 02:53:22,400
because they get these great original stuff.

2438
02:53:22,400 --> 02:53:25,080
And then Karaoke Revolution had a lot of stuff as well.

2439
02:53:25,080 --> 02:53:28,400
They redid cover songs, but it was all pretty good.

2440
02:53:28,400 --> 02:53:29,720
So it should be interesting.

2441
02:53:29,720 --> 02:53:33,120
Now, they had a website at guitarherogame.com,

2442
02:53:33,120 --> 02:53:36,800
but it got taken down as soon as the web's DDR Freak put out

2443
02:53:36,800 --> 02:53:38,680
a press release on this too.

2444
02:53:38,680 --> 02:53:43,360
I believe it was either Games Are Fun or somebody

2445
02:53:43,360 --> 02:53:45,320
had said it first.

2446
02:53:45,320 --> 02:53:50,880
I think it was Games are Fun originally put the story out there, so everybody got a hold

2447
02:53:50,880 --> 02:53:51,880
of this.

2448
02:53:51,880 --> 02:53:53,080
But this is the other interesting thing.

2449
02:53:53,080 --> 02:53:55,760
Now this goes back to way in the beginning of the show.

2450
02:53:55,760 --> 02:53:59,160
You were talking about some guy was giving you their card and talking about Red Octane.

2451
02:53:59,160 --> 02:54:04,200
They also have a site called BAGuitarHero.com, which also got taken down, but they're actually

2452
02:54:04,200 --> 02:54:08,960
having a contest to get bands in the game.

2453
02:54:08,960 --> 02:54:13,080
So maybe the guy you were talking to was one of these folks trying to get their music in

2454
02:54:13,080 --> 02:54:14,640
the new Guitar Hero game.

2455
02:54:14,640 --> 02:54:17,680
I still think he was macking on me. Maybe, but you never know.

2456
02:54:17,680 --> 02:54:22,240
Okay. Alright. What is this game going to include? Well,

2457
02:54:22,240 --> 02:54:26,520
the site indicated before it got taken down that it would have songs made famous

2458
02:54:26,520 --> 02:54:27,160
by

2459
02:54:27,160 --> 02:54:30,720
Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and White Zombie.

2460
02:54:30,720 --> 02:54:34,960
Of course, when they say the term made famous by, you can pick up that it's going to be

2461
02:54:34,960 --> 02:54:35,680
covers.

2462
02:54:35,680 --> 02:54:39,440
But, you know, Karaoke Revolution, the covers weren't

2463
02:54:39,440 --> 02:54:43,800
that bad until they crossed over into DDR, then they were pretty bad. I don't know man, White Zombie's

2464
02:54:43,800 --> 02:54:51,200
pretty awesome. Yeah, it should be interesting. So that's all we know for now. Of course we'll

2465
02:54:51,200 --> 02:54:57,520
know more after E3. So we shall see. I hope they have this game playable there. We'll

2466
02:54:57,520 --> 02:55:00,480
see. Well it seems like it might be a little early because they're still trying to get

2467
02:55:00,480 --> 02:55:04,060
music. No, you could do that. I mean, they're looking for artists, but they can do like

2468
02:55:04,060 --> 02:55:08,520
a few songs, at least a song playable demo or something. Maybe, we'll see. I didn't even,

2469
02:55:08,520 --> 02:55:12,720
did Red Octane even have a booth last year? Kentia, I think. Really? Okay, then they'll

2470
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:15,240
They'll probably have something like that there again, so it should be interesting.

2471
02:55:15,240 --> 02:55:18,240
Kensho Hall, by the way, for those that are unfamiliar with E3, they basically have two

2472
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:19,240
huge halls.

2473
02:55:19,240 --> 02:55:20,240
What is it?

2474
02:55:20,240 --> 02:55:21,480
West Hall and Main Hall?

2475
02:55:21,480 --> 02:55:22,480
I don't know.

2476
02:55:22,480 --> 02:55:23,480
Main Hall, West.

2477
02:55:23,480 --> 02:55:24,480
Main Hall, West Hall.

2478
02:55:24,480 --> 02:55:29,440
Main Hall is where Xbox was last year and all the other big developers.

2479
02:55:29,440 --> 02:55:35,200
Places like Electronic Arts, who else is in there?

2480
02:55:35,200 --> 02:55:36,200
Engage.

2481
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:37,200
Engage.

2482
02:55:37,200 --> 02:55:38,200
Konami.

2483
02:55:38,200 --> 02:55:40,200
And the UF Army.

2484
02:55:40,200 --> 02:55:41,920
All those folks are in the Main Hall.

2485
02:55:41,920 --> 02:55:45,400
The West Hall is another huge hall, and that's where Nintendo and Sony were last year, and

2486
02:55:45,400 --> 02:55:47,880
where presumably these guys are going to be again.

2487
02:55:47,880 --> 02:55:51,800
And then some other, like, you know, not quite as big, but pretty big stuff like 1UP.com

2488
02:55:51,800 --> 02:55:55,200
I think was in there, and TechTV, when they were still around, had a booth in there, and

2489
02:55:55,200 --> 02:56:00,040
some of the folks that put out the plug your joystick into the TV thing, they were all

2490
02:56:00,040 --> 02:56:01,040
in there.

2491
02:56:01,040 --> 02:56:02,520
And they shipped Sega and Acclaim into little side rooms.

2492
02:56:02,520 --> 02:56:05,800
And then there's little side rooms, and that's where Sega, Acclaim, Atari, where they all

2493
02:56:05,800 --> 02:56:07,920
were, like rooms along the way.

2494
02:56:07,920 --> 02:56:11,760
And then you have this place called Kensha Hall, and if you don't know where it is, you'll

2495
02:56:11,760 --> 02:56:15,200
miss it it's underneath the main hall you go downstairs and there's this

2496
02:56:15,200 --> 02:56:18,840
other place and that's where they kind of stuck all the Korean games and like

2497
02:56:18,840 --> 02:56:22,520
there was like Korean alley and peripherals and stuff and that's where

2498
02:56:22,520 --> 02:56:25,200
some of the cool stuff oh yeah what's interesting about Kenshi a hall is that

2499
02:56:25,200 --> 02:56:27,560
even though people joke about it and say it's the place where games go to die

2500
02:56:27,560 --> 02:56:31,660
it's one of the more interesting places e3 it's really your hidden gems area

2501
02:56:31,660 --> 02:56:35,780
that's where classic gaming Expo is doing a little preview that's where the

2502
02:56:35,780 --> 02:56:42,720
the X-Tango game was, whatever happened to that? O2 Jam, all that stuff was down there.

2503
02:56:42,720 --> 02:56:46,820
So it'll be interesting to see what Kenshi Hall has this year. Maybe Red Octane, I know

2504
02:56:46,820 --> 02:56:51,580
the competing company, the guy that I talked to from some other company and I don't remember

2505
02:56:51,580 --> 02:56:54,780
who it was. Yeah, whatever just happened with the speakers. Yeah, and then there was the

2506
02:56:54,780 --> 02:56:58,460
guy who said they would send us the speakers to review on the show and we didn't get any.

2507
02:56:58,460 --> 02:57:03,860
Oh well. Bummer. Alright, so of course now that you guys have been asking in chat, will

2508
02:57:03,860 --> 02:57:09,860
Will Orange Lounge be going again? Yes. Will we be taking pictures and putting them on the website? Hell yes. We're going to take tons and tons of pictures.

2509
02:57:09,860 --> 02:57:14,860
I'm getting pictures with booth babes this time. Son of a bitch. I am not being the one holding the camera.

2510
02:57:14,860 --> 02:57:17,860
No, no, no. I have to get the booth babe pictures. It's not fair.

2511
02:57:17,860 --> 02:57:21,860
I will also be armed with a digital camera this year because I am borrowing somebody's.

2512
02:57:21,860 --> 02:57:28,860
Actually, I will be on the hunt for booth hunks this year, but we'll see. I doubt they'd pose with me, but maybe I'll use Dark Sakura.

2513
02:57:28,860 --> 02:57:29,860
Booth boys?

2514
02:57:29,860 --> 02:57:32,860
Booth boys. I'll use Dark Sakura for that.

2515
02:57:32,860 --> 02:57:34,260
I'm like, hey, baby.

2516
02:57:34,260 --> 02:57:36,620
Here, take a picture with my friend.

2517
02:57:36,620 --> 02:57:38,700
Hey, baby.

2518
02:57:38,700 --> 02:57:39,980
So that's going to go on.

2519
02:57:39,980 --> 02:57:40,560
We'll have that.

2520
02:57:40,560 --> 02:57:44,300
We will also be podcasting every day from E3.

2521
02:57:44,300 --> 02:57:45,820
We're still trying to work out the details of how we're going

2522
02:57:45,820 --> 02:57:46,340
to do that.

2523
02:57:46,340 --> 02:57:47,820

02:58:32,860 --> 02:58:37,700

2539
02:58:37,700 --> 02:58:38,700
ethical.

2540
02:58:38,700 --> 02:58:39,700

2545
02:58:51,620 --> 02:58:52,620
And attention's great.

2546
02:58:52,620 --> 02:58:54,620
Who doesn't like attention?

2547
02:58:54,620 --> 02:58:56,860
Me!

2548
02:58:56,860 --> 02:58:58,860
I love the pension wars!

2549
02:58:57,860 --> 02:58:59,860
No!

2550
02:58:59,860 --> 02:59:02,860
Now, we only made a radio show for the fun of it, you know?

2551
02:59:02,860 --> 02:59:04,860
Yeah, for the fun- the thrill.

2552
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:05,860
The thrill of the hunting.

2553
02:59:04,860 --> 02:59:05,860
Rob!

2554
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:06,860
What?

2555
02:59:05,860 --> 02:59:06,860
Rob!

2556
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:07,860
What?

2557
02:59:06,860 --> 02:59:07,860
What?

2558
02:59:07,860 --> 02:59:08,860
Rob!

2559
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:09,860
What?

2560
02:59:08,860 --> 02:59:09,860
W-w-what?

2561
02:59:09,860 --> 02:59:14,860
Ahhh.

2562
02:59:13,860 --> 02:59:14,860
Ahhh.

2563
02:59:14,860 --> 02:59:19,860
Ahhhh.

2564
02:59:16,860 --> 02:59:18,860
Hm hm hm.

2565
02:59:18,860 --> 02:59:27,700
Sorry for the dead air there. I just had to put a little plug in the chat room there.

2566
02:59:27,700 --> 02:59:31,140
Also, we have a club on 1UP.com that nobody ever uses or posts in. So if you're a 1UP.com...

2567
02:59:31,140 --> 02:59:32,140
Do you have a club?

2568
02:59:32,140 --> 02:59:35,020
Yeah, we do. If you have a 1UP.com account, look for the Orange Launch Radio Club. Just

2569
02:59:35,020 --> 02:59:36,140
do a search. We're on there.

2570
02:59:36,140 --> 02:59:40,860
You know, I have a MySpace account and only one person is... Well, two people have friended

2571
02:59:40,860 --> 02:59:45,860
me. One person being you and one person being some chick.

2572
02:59:45,860 --> 02:59:46,860
Wait, what is this? 1UP?

2573
02:59:46,860 --> 02:59:47,860
No, MySpace.

2574
02:59:47,860 --> 02:59:48,860
MySpace.

2575
02:59:48,860 --> 02:59:49,860
Oh, MySpace.

2576
02:59:49,860 --> 02:59:50,860
Oh, okay.

2577
02:59:50,860 --> 02:59:52,780
You know, if I had known I made one, you should...

2578
02:59:52,780 --> 02:59:54,940
My MySpace name is Loki O-L-R.

2579
02:59:54,940 --> 02:59:57,060
Did you put your picture on there?

2580
02:59:57,060 --> 02:59:58,060
No.

2581
02:59:58,060 --> 02:59:59,060
See, that's why.

2582
02:59:59,060 --> 03:00:02,480
Put a picture of you looking metrosexual and you'll have women from everywhere.

2583
03:00:02,480 --> 03:00:05,620
I don't have any metrosexual pictures.

2584
03:00:05,620 --> 03:00:06,620
We can fix that.

2585
03:00:06,620 --> 03:00:11,500
We'll get you a little button-up shirt and, you know, paint your nails or something and,

2586
03:00:11,500 --> 03:00:12,500
you know...

2587
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:13,500
Yeah, just paint my man.

2588
03:00:13,500 --> 03:00:15,500
Wear what Ander's wearing.

2589
03:00:15,500 --> 03:00:22,840
all right okay whatever huh anyway look if you want to be popular you got to be

2590
03:00:22,840 --> 03:00:31,760
metrosexual because you know homo cell that's what it is and I am almost I can

2591
03:00:31,760 --> 03:00:36,280
say that it's okay okay definitely when we're making gay jokes you know the

2592
03:00:36,280 --> 03:00:39,620
show's over so please put the nail in the coffin of this show let's go around

2593
03:00:39,620 --> 03:00:43,520
and get everybody's final thought we'll start it off with toady your final

2594
03:00:43,520 --> 03:00:48,720
thought? What exactly is this my final thought on? Just, you know, whatever you

2595
03:00:48,720 --> 03:00:51,600
want. Your final, it's like Jerry Springer. At the end of every show he would give

2596
03:00:51,600 --> 03:00:55,680
you his final thoughts. What's your final thought? Okay, I'm eagerly anticipating

2597
03:00:55,680 --> 03:01:02,480
the ITG home version. I hope that Konami doesn't fuck up the new Xtreme 2 like

2598
03:01:02,480 --> 03:01:05,960
they fucked up the other one. I'm pretty sure that's already been covered on

2599
03:01:05,960 --> 03:01:13,960
previous shows. And, yeah, I think that's it. I'm good.

2600
03:01:13,960 --> 03:01:16,960
Alright. Loki, your final thought?

2601
03:01:16,960 --> 03:01:24,600
Work, work, work. I'm hoping to play more Final Fantasy XI this week. God damn it,

2602
03:01:24,600 --> 03:01:29,920
I need to get back in my routine. It's just, you know, the woman wants attention. You know

2603
03:01:29,920 --> 03:01:35,320
how that is. And, I don't know, it's just like, I had to play last night from like,

2604
03:01:35,320 --> 03:01:41,280
you know 10 to 2 a.m. and I started getting tired. You know what else is

2605
03:01:41,280 --> 03:01:46,040
really awesome? Golden grams. And I bet you guys didn't know this if you pour

2606
03:01:46,040 --> 03:01:51,800
enough water into a toilet it will eventually flush itself. Now you know.

2607
03:01:51,800 --> 03:01:57,280
And you know my final thought is you know what else is pretty cool is golden

2608
03:01:57,280 --> 03:02:12,280
I'm going to be doing some gaming this week before going to E3, just because I have to

2609
03:02:12,280 --> 03:02:14,240
get back into the gamer mindset.

2610
03:02:14,240 --> 03:02:21,100
Last night Dan and I on our main machine beat Metal Slug X, they gave us fucking hard, Metal

2611
03:02:21,100 --> 03:02:26,320
Slug X is pretty damn awesome, we got turned into zombies the whole game, it was great,

2612
03:02:26,320 --> 03:02:38,040
And then I plan on doing some PSO tomorrow, Final Fantasy XI on Wednesday, PSO night on

2613
03:02:38,040 --> 03:02:45,640
Friday the 13th, I should be on episode 8, look for me, Dark Sakura, or Cover Girl, or

2614
03:02:45,640 --> 03:02:50,640
I forgot the other two that I have, look for the ID card for Gunstar Hero, because that's

2615
03:02:50,640 --> 03:02:54,360
actually Dan's name, since we're on the same account.

2616
03:02:54,360 --> 03:02:55,360
And that's it.

2617
03:02:55,360 --> 03:03:01,800
one last very important thing reject false icons unless they're in DDR then

2618
03:03:01,800 --> 03:03:07,900
worship them because you know it's gonna be nothing but false icons reject false

2619
03:03:07,900 --> 03:03:15,800
DDR all right haha oh okay and lastly the final word of the show one word to

2620
03:03:15,800 --> 03:03:19,540
wrap everything up that we've talked about in this show and sum it all up you

2621
03:03:19,540 --> 03:03:22,540
You know I gotta give it to you, our guest, Tody. One word. Final word.

2622
03:03:22,540 --> 03:03:24,540
Oh shit. Put me on the spot here.

2623
03:03:24,540 --> 03:03:25,540
Um...

2624
03:03:25,540 --> 03:03:27,540
That's the idea is to put people on the spot.

2625
03:03:27,540 --> 03:03:29,540
God damn it. I hate it when you do that.

2626
03:03:29,540 --> 03:03:32,540
Alright, uh, metrosexual is gonna be the word.

2627
03:03:32,540 --> 03:03:37,540

2631
03:03:55,540 --> 03:04:14,540
Stop taking on me, because I'm a thief I'm strength to you, you're strength to me

2632
03:04:14,540 --> 03:04:19,540
Well one of these days, I'm gonna pack heat

2633
03:04:19,540 --> 03:04:24,540
Your beads on the wall, my face, my face on TV

2634
03:04:24,540 --> 03:04:27,540
They dissipate the pungent odor of a power holder

2635
03:04:27,540 --> 03:04:29,540
Then kickers come in 60 clips upon the sonar

2636
03:04:29,540 --> 03:04:31,540
They're gonna fold me over like a chopper keeper folder

2637
03:04:31,540 --> 03:04:33,540
If this is D&D you'd see me jumping to a portal

2638
03:04:33,540 --> 03:04:36,540
I'm a geek, spreadsheet double EK

2639
03:04:36,540 --> 03:04:38,540
I beat my boys in the basement about every day

2640
03:04:38,540 --> 03:04:41,540
A card table, comic books, and Ken's a cult

2641
03:04:41,540 --> 03:04:44,900
That we blow it up, I know that they're our star, what's yours? We got style

2642
03:04:44,900 --> 03:04:49,340
Tape on our glasses, sticks on our faces They hit on our asses, shiny shoes

2643
03:04:49,340 --> 03:04:53,340
Bell buckles, and pocket protectors Straight to our backpacks like my main man Vicks

2644
03:04:53,340 --> 03:04:54,740
Bunch we got problems

2645
03:04:54,740 --> 03:04:58,140
Name me the jock, the MTV suckers with cartoons and their cocks

2646
03:04:58,140 --> 03:05:00,540
Otherwise known as the motherfucker sucks if it's it

2647
03:05:00,540 --> 03:05:02,940
If I was Wolverine, you'd hear my knuckles go snick

2648
03:05:02,940 --> 03:05:05,540
I'm not perfect, the big four picture of Peter Parker

2649
03:05:05,540 --> 03:05:08,740
Always trippin', drop my tray in front of the girl that always fucks with I got brains

2650
03:05:08,740 --> 03:05:12,740
Fuck B's and C's, I got a great porn average higher than Henderson or Uzi, what?

2651
03:05:12,740 --> 03:05:16,740
Take it on me, because I'm a geek

2652
03:05:16,740 --> 03:05:21,740
I'm sick to you, you're sick to me

2653
03:05:21,740 --> 03:05:26,740
Well, one of these days, I'm gonna pack heaps

2654
03:05:26,740 --> 03:05:31,740
Your face on the wall, my face, my face on repeat

2655
03:05:31,740 --> 03:05:33,740
Don't fuck with the geek, just cause he got a gift

2656
03:05:33,740 --> 03:05:36,740
You get my way, bitch, you get a broken egg pinch

2657
03:05:36,740 --> 03:05:41,460
One night I didn't go to sleep, up playin' Riff At dawn, I won, got global dominance

2658
03:05:41,460 --> 03:05:43,860
But in the hallway it's completely different shit

2659
03:05:43,860 --> 03:05:46,260
Can't get my locker open and my pants are always slick

2660
03:05:46,260 --> 03:05:48,740
Can't seem to catch a ride, can't ever get a date

2661
03:05:48,740 --> 03:05:51,300
But in my mind, seven to nine things are great

2662
03:05:51,300 --> 03:05:53,460
Come night fight, prima donna's prevail

2663
03:05:53,460 --> 03:05:55,780
I'm a homo-sittin', lines from the holy grail

2664
03:05:55,780 --> 03:06:00,660
Stuffed nose, exes swollen glands Never been kissed, never been on hands

2665
03:06:00,660 --> 03:06:03,620
Just buck my biscuits over Britney in a bubble bath

2666
03:06:03,620 --> 03:06:05,860
Darth Vader wishin' haters can't follow collabs

2667
03:06:05,860 --> 03:06:08,260
The dragon died from a heart attack

2668
03:06:08,260 --> 03:06:10,580
You may advance and you're up to armor class

2669
03:06:10,580 --> 03:06:12,740
Being a geek, it ain't so bad

2670
03:06:12,740 --> 03:06:15,060
I can't get laid, I got you pandemic-sashed

2671
03:06:15,060 --> 03:06:17,700
In a mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts

2672
03:06:17,700 --> 03:06:19,860
Dread knocks, rock, dynamite kicks, yeah!

2673
03:06:19,860 --> 03:06:21,460
Stop drinking on me

2674
03:06:22,260 --> 03:06:23,860
Because I'm ugly

2675
03:06:24,260 --> 03:06:26,260
Because I'm fake to you

2676
03:06:27,060 --> 03:06:29,060
Because I'm fake to you

2677
03:06:29,460 --> 03:06:31,460
But I wanna be fake

2678
03:06:31,860 --> 03:06:33,860
Because I'm ugly

2679
03:06:33,860 --> 03:06:39,860
My name's on TV!

2680
03:06:50,860 --> 03:06:52,860
Stop picking on me!

2681
03:06:53,360 --> 03:06:54,860
Because I'm ugly!

2682
03:06:55,860 --> 03:06:57,860
I'm straight to you!

2683
03:06:58,360 --> 03:06:59,860
You're straight to me!

2684
03:07:00,860 --> 03:07:02,860
Well what do you think?

2685
03:07:02,860 --> 03:07:07,360
I'm gonna pack him, your face on the wall

2686
03:07:07,860 --> 03:07:11,360
My face, my face on TV

2687
03:07:12,360 --> 03:07:16,860
Because I'm a thief, I'm safe to you

2688
03:07:17,360 --> 03:07:21,860
You're safe to me, well what do you say?

2689
03:07:22,360 --> 03:07:26,360
I'm gonna pack him, your face on the wall

2690
03:07:26,860 --> 03:07:30,360
My face, my face on TV

2691
03:07:30,360 --> 03:07:35,080
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

2692
03:08:00,360 --> 03:08:07,600
All right, boys and girls, that's that for now.

2693
03:08:07,600 --> 03:08:10,680
We will be going back to our Bomani Music and More program.
