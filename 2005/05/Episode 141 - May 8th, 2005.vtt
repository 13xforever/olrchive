WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
I'm on my own, drink like a chocolat

00:07.000 --> 00:14.000
Call a party, follow in the heart

00:14.000 --> 00:17.000
Down to green

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
I'm on a plane, I'll be by my feet

00:22.000 --> 00:25.000
It's how I'm wise

00:26.000 --> 00:29.000
I tell maybe you should

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Take a chance, put me down to death

00:33.000 --> 00:35.000
We're looking for a girl who wants more

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
Who likes more two girls, two boys

00:38.000 --> 00:42.000
Like they're girls, two girls like that boy

00:42.000 --> 00:48.000
I should be the one you really are

00:48.000 --> 01:01.000
I should be in love like you will

01:01.000 --> 01:13.000
I should be in love like you will

01:43.000 --> 01:47.000
And I think let's go

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
To a new dimension

01:49.000 --> 01:52.000
And we have a thing we can choose

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
Go to one voice, you're like boys

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
And we go to two boys

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
Like bad girls and two girls

01:58.000 --> 01:59.000
Like bad boys

01:59.000 --> 02:05.000
Oh, I should see someone you really like

02:07.000 --> 02:10.000
Go to one voice, you're like boys

02:10.000 --> 02:15.000
You go to two boys like that, go to two girls like that, boy

02:15.000 --> 02:22.000
Oh, I should be the one you really like

04:15.000 --> 04:44.000

farm. Say hello to Miss Jamie Summers. You know her better as Dark Sakura. I wouldn't

08:03.260 --> 08:08.460
say I'm the happiest bunny on the farm today, but I'm pretty damn happy. You're kind of

08:08.460 --> 08:13.980
a... I'm the most carnivorous bunny on the farm. Alright, fair enough. I've been eating

08:13.980 --> 08:18.780
nothing meat all day and I feel violent. You're not going to hurt anything during this show

08:18.780 --> 08:22.060

08:22.060 --> 08:29.060
me a ferret. Hey baby. Also joining us, say hello to the one, the only Loki. Also remember

08:30.940 --> 08:36.940
it's the most motherly read. I was going to get there, I was going to get there. Hey,

08:36.940 --> 08:43.240
just saying. I did that stuff yesterday because I don't want to interfere with today, my sleeping

08:43.240 --> 08:50.360
and going to fries and whatnot just take a moment to thank the womb where you were cooked so

08:52.280 --> 08:56.280
okay you don't have to think about it that way if you don't want anyway also joining us tonight

08:56.280 --> 09:00.840
we have some special guests say hello to somebody who was at the show i don't know a couple months

09:00.840 --> 09:06.280
ago but he's back tonight say hello to i don't know how to introduce you uh toady pirate power

09:06.280 --> 09:09.720
i don't know what he would call you you could call me i guess go by toady because that's what

09:09.720 --> 09:12.720
That's what I'm on on like all 70,000 forums I'm on.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.720
All right.

09:13.720 --> 09:14.720
All right, Tody.

09:14.720 --> 09:15.720
How are you?

09:15.720 --> 09:16.720
Okay.

09:16.720 --> 09:17.720
I think I'm getting sick.

09:17.720 --> 09:18.720
Everybody I know is sick.

09:18.720 --> 09:19.720
Get the hell away from me.

09:19.720 --> 09:21.600
I'm a good four feet, so I think we're good.

09:21.600 --> 09:22.600
I know.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.320
We're in the new studio now, though, so it's awesome.

09:24.320 --> 09:28.280
I could reach out and hug everyone right now in this new studio.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.720
You can check out the new webcam over at www.orangeweld.com.

09:30.720 --> 09:36.240
Of course, the only person you can see is me right now, but we'll try to get it around.

09:36.240 --> 09:40.960
So say hello to, and there's a reason you're here tonight, and we're going to talk about

09:40.960 --> 09:43.360
that when we get into the show.

09:43.360 --> 09:46.640
We like having you here for no reason in particular, but tonight you have a very specific reason

09:46.640 --> 09:47.640
for being here.

09:47.640 --> 09:48.640
Okay.

09:48.640 --> 09:49.640
I'll try not to let you down.

09:49.640 --> 09:50.640
All right.

09:50.640 --> 09:51.640
And also joining us tonight, say hello to Bug.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.640
Hello.

09:52.640 --> 09:53.640
And how are you, sir?

09:53.640 --> 09:54.640
I'm doing great.

09:54.640 --> 09:58.720
I'm trying to make computers work.

09:58.720 --> 10:04.660
Our resident tech geek, Bug, because then when you get Tech Guru, Loki, and Tech Geek

10:04.660 --> 10:06.860
bugged in the same room it's just

10:06.860 --> 10:08.640
i don't know it's assault

10:08.640 --> 10:12.720
and i think we'll collect in twenty at twenty degrees of dork in here right now

10:12.720 --> 10:13.920
anyway i have

10:13.920 --> 10:16.940
all sorts of interesting things we're gonna talk about tonight show

10:16.940 --> 10:20.380
i got to check out that in the group premiere party

10:20.380 --> 10:23.740
so i'd definitely want to talk about that and of course the reason toady fear

10:23.740 --> 10:26.280
you into it too

10:26.280 --> 10:29.780
unfortunately dark soccer and look you are unable to make it so so many people

10:29.780 --> 10:31.780
I might have to go to school.

10:59.780 --> 11:03.960
of people there that want to say hi to you, www.orangelouder.com. Thanks to the same sources

11:03.960 --> 11:09.060
last year, apparently Konami just doesn't learn. We'll see, we'll talk about all that.

11:09.060 --> 11:11.620
If you have a big question mark about that, we're going to talk about that when we come

11:11.620 --> 11:15.780
back. Starting this break, I figured since we're going to be talking about Extreme 2

11:15.780 --> 11:19.220
at some point tonight, we should play some music from the first DDR Extreme that was

11:19.220 --> 11:23.140
released in the US. So here's some music, and we'll be back after this with more Orange

11:23.140 --> 11:30.140
Lounge Radio, see you then!

11:53.140 --> 11:55.140
You know the vibration, action, fun

11:55.140 --> 11:57.140
I say hey, hey, hey

11:57.140 --> 11:59.140
What you got to say, what you got to say

11:59.140 --> 12:02.140
I say one, two, three, four, five

13:02.140 --> 13:28.140
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

13:28.140 --> 13:35.140
It's got to forever, the raindrops blow and the wind is dancing

13:35.140 --> 13:42.140
It would be a much better fight, with you, with me

13:42.140 --> 13:49.140
If you hadn't met me, I'd be fine on my own baby

13:49.140 --> 13:54.140
Never felt so lonely then you came along

13:54.140 --> 13:58.140
So now what should I do?

13:58.140 --> 14:01.140
I'm strong, ow, I need to see you

14:01.140 --> 14:05.140
My body aches, now that you're gone

14:05.140 --> 14:09.140
My supplies fell through

14:09.140 --> 14:14.140
You let me give me everything you had and more

14:14.140 --> 14:17.140
You craved my happiness

14:17.140 --> 14:20.140
When you made me feel joy and made you smile

14:20.140 --> 14:23.140
But now I feel your stress

14:23.140 --> 14:25.140
Love was never meant to be

14:25.140 --> 14:28.140
Such a crazy affair, no

14:28.140 --> 14:30.140
And who has time for tears?

14:30.140 --> 14:32.140
Never thought I'd sit around

14:32.140 --> 14:37.140
And unravel your love

14:37.140 --> 14:41.140
This is who I am

15:07.140 --> 15:13.140
There is so much that we should have done

15:14.140 --> 15:17.140
I was into Cuba

15:18.140 --> 15:22.140
Now I'm strong

15:27.140 --> 15:29.140
Driving

15:29.140 --> 15:37.140
Knowing it was you I keep on trying

15:37.140 --> 15:45.140
Diving into you

15:45.140 --> 15:53.140
Diving into you

15:53.140 --> 16:18.140
Looking out a dirty old window Down below the cars in the city go rushing

16:18.140 --> 16:26.140
I sit here alone and I wonder why

16:26.140 --> 16:29.140
Friday night and everyone

16:29.140 --> 16:34.140
I can feel the heat but it's soothing heading down

16:34.140 --> 16:39.140
I search for the beat in this steady town

16:39.140 --> 16:42.140
Downtown Leon without going

16:42.140 --> 16:45.140
Downtown Leon without going

16:45.140 --> 16:51.140
We're the kids in America

16:51.140 --> 16:55.140
Everybody lives for the music, alright

17:21.140 --> 17:37.840
We're the kids! We're the kids! We're the kids of America!

17:37.840 --> 18:03.560
Hi, we're back with Orange Lounge Radio.

18:03.560 --> 18:07.880
that break you heard some Kids in America before that Four Strings with Diving, Heather

18:07.880 --> 18:11.280
You're Not Here, originally famous in Silent Hill 3, but then you got to dance to it. And

18:11.280 --> 18:17.720
then Funk Boogie, all from DDR Extreme at USA. And of course, as I mentioned earlier,

18:17.720 --> 18:23.360
big news, some site mentioned that DDR Extreme 2 is coming out and is going to make a big

18:23.360 --> 18:27.920
debut at E3. We'll talk about that a little more later. First, I want to start off, of

18:27.920 --> 18:30.520
course, with tonight's show, starting off how we start off every show with a little

18:30.520 --> 18:33.120
bit of How Was Your Week, How Was Your Day, where we talk about our adventures through

18:33.120 --> 18:37.720
the week, and you know, any, especially gaming experiences we love to hear about especially

18:37.720 --> 18:38.720
too.

18:38.720 --> 18:40.920
Starting off with the one and only, Dark Sakura.

18:40.920 --> 18:47.960
My week has been interesting, I was, I've basically been in a lot of pain all week,

18:47.960 --> 18:52.960
but most of it doped up on Vicodin, woohoo, and Flexerol, not woohoo for pain, but woohoo

18:52.960 --> 18:53.960
for Vicodin.

18:53.960 --> 19:00.120
Yeah, I've managed to go two days until today without taking any Vicodin, and then I started

19:00.120 --> 19:03.720
to hurt really bad again, so I took some more.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.040
But it was all just work, school crap.

19:06.040 --> 19:09.280
I was going to go to the end of the group thing, and instead,

19:09.280 --> 19:11.380
so that I can get out of my final, which

19:11.380 --> 19:14.680
is the first day of E3, I gave up

19:14.680 --> 19:16.600
going to the end of the group thing

19:16.600 --> 19:18.480
because my education is more important.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.600
Listen to all of this.

19:19.600 --> 19:23.880
Your education is more important than video games.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.480
Ignorant people.

19:25.480 --> 19:28.000
Well now, what if you're going to go to one of those schools

19:28.000 --> 19:30.380
that you see in the G4 commercial that you know,

19:30.380 --> 19:32.260
learn about how to play games for a living.

19:32.260 --> 19:35.500
Games, games, games, games, games, games.

19:35.500 --> 19:36.260
No comment.

19:36.260 --> 19:38.760
OK.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.500
But, um.

19:41.500 --> 19:43.340
You know you want to say something.

19:43.340 --> 19:46.180
I was just going to say, I saw one of those advertisements

19:46.180 --> 19:47.540
the other day for beta testing.

19:47.540 --> 19:49.460
They're all, you need to tighten up the graphics

19:49.460 --> 19:51.260
at the end of level three.

19:51.260 --> 19:55.380
It made beta testing look extremely fun.

19:55.380 --> 19:57.880
No.

19:57.880 --> 20:11.880
Anyway, Thursday though, I went to karaoke for a little bit, and then went to Rapture, which was basically goth industrial, and had a really good time.

20:11.880 --> 20:16.880
I see a little bit of that reflected in your pre-show selections for this evening. It was a little bit angsty.

20:16.880 --> 20:16.880
No.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.880
I wouldn't say angsty, but more, it was tragic. Your playlist was tragic.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.880
I had some Britpop in there.

20:22.880 --> 20:24.880
A little bit, but it was tragic Britpop.

20:24.880 --> 20:25.880
How is it tragic?

20:25.880 --> 20:27.880
I'm just messing with you.

20:27.880 --> 20:30.880
I don't see how Pat Shop Boys gets very tragic.

20:30.880 --> 20:33.880
Well, yeah, they do have some kind of angsty stuff.

20:33.880 --> 20:37.880
Because a guy whines when he sings.

20:37.880 --> 20:42.880
Anyway, um, I've been in a good mood since then.

20:42.880 --> 20:46.880
Except Friday, I heard back from the other guy's insurance company.

20:46.880 --> 20:48.880
Well, that taxi cab company's insurance company.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.880
Tried to call the stupid guy back because he left a message on my voicemail.

20:51.880 --> 20:54.880
And this relates to your car accident from a few weeks ago, for those who missed it.

20:54.880 --> 20:59.880
And he never called me back. He apparently never came back to his desk.

20:59.880 --> 21:04.880
And I need the money, so if they flat out refuse to pay me, I'm suing them.

21:04.880 --> 21:08.880
I've already talked about getting an accident attorney.

21:08.880 --> 21:11.880
And you know me, I will rip them.

21:11.880 --> 21:13.880
Coming soon to CORT TV.

21:13.880 --> 21:15.880
Seriously. But no, I'm going to give them...

21:15.880 --> 21:16.880
Take them on Judge Judy.

21:16.880 --> 21:18.880
No.

21:18.880 --> 21:21.880
See, I have this thing called a sense of pride.

21:21.880 --> 21:23.880
Okay, how about Texas Justice?

21:23.880 --> 21:27.880
Don't even go there.

21:27.880 --> 21:31.880
Have you ever watched Texas Justice?

21:31.880 --> 21:35.880
Is that where the loser gets hanged?

21:35.880 --> 21:39.880
I think they play it just before cops.

21:39.880 --> 21:43.880
And you can just tell what the target audience is for this power hour.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.880
Anyway, sorry.

21:47.880 --> 21:51.880
No. But I'm going to give them a fair opportunity. I'm going to get a copy of the police report.

21:51.880 --> 21:57.980
There's no way they really can't pay me because he was fully at fault, you know, pulled out

21:57.980 --> 21:59.940
in front of me when I had the right of way.

21:59.940 --> 22:05.780
I wasn't on my cell phone and my headlights were on so there's nothing they can do.

22:05.780 --> 22:09.980
But it doesn't help my hip and my back to feel any better.

22:09.980 --> 22:13.180
You know, when you go to court, are you going to wear one of those giant, like, poofy neck

22:13.180 --> 22:14.180
brace things?

22:14.180 --> 22:15.180
No.

22:15.180 --> 22:17.820
That when people are injured in accidents- I'll wear a hip harness.

22:17.820 --> 22:21.580
Like whenever you see people on TV that were injured in a car accident, they always have

22:21.580 --> 22:24.320
the neck harness it doesn't matter what they broke they could have broke their

22:24.320 --> 22:26.840
ankle and they've got a giant neck harness you know I actually have one of

22:26.840 --> 22:30.700
those but as from when I fell down you know a foot wall and landed on my back

22:30.700 --> 22:37.520
ouch yeah they didn't give me Vicodin then they gave me codeine as I'd like I

22:37.520 --> 22:44.920
was drunk for days but um but I had a lot of fun yesterday I completely went

22:44.920 --> 22:48.080
off my diet and had fish and chips and then I had ice cream and then went to

22:48.080 --> 22:52.920
hot topic I'm sorry instagoth to do some shopping

22:52.920 --> 22:59.800
here's it's pretty good cider that's what was that stuff called that Apple

22:59.800 --> 23:08.240
cider that was blackthorn dry cider that stuff was good and had Guinness too it's

23:08.240 --> 23:11.400
like it doesn't matter what kind of day I have you put Guinness in front of me

23:11.400 --> 23:14.760
and I'm instantly happy but that cider was good I'm gonna need to hunt some of

23:14.760 --> 23:17.320
that down for home.

23:17.320 --> 23:18.360
All right.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.480
And today, I did my homework.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.280
For my technical writing class, I have to write a tutorial.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.360
And actually, the whole tutorial is not due for two weeks.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.200
I have to review somebody else's tutorial,

23:28.200 --> 23:30.840
but I'm just going to do everything at once.

23:30.840 --> 23:33.840
But my tutorial is on how to make live journal

23:33.840 --> 23:35.640
icons using PaintShop Pro 8.

23:35.640 --> 23:37.800
Are you going to post that on the interweb for anybody

23:37.800 --> 23:38.800
to see when it's done?

23:38.800 --> 23:39.760
Sure, why not?

23:39.760 --> 23:40.600
I'll have that.

23:40.600 --> 23:43.140
I'm hopefully going to have it finished by the end of the week

23:43.140 --> 23:48.220
up on the web. You can see my homework. And tomorrow I get to paint. I was supposed to

23:48.220 --> 23:54.100
do it today, but eh. I went to bed at 4 a.m., sorry, 4.30 in the morning, and got up at

23:54.100 --> 23:58.300
half past noon. So yeah. Sky done.

23:58.300 --> 24:03.420
Alright. Let's move on to Loki. Loki, sir, how was your week? How was your day? Put down

24:03.420 --> 24:08.620
the luminous. Hey, okay, okay. I'm getting further now that I actually have time to play.

24:08.620 --> 24:16.620
No, my day was okay. I went to Fry's to buy a bunch of supplies for my printer, and we'll get into that stuff later.

24:16.620 --> 24:22.620
Fry's rocks, but I mean, I try not to go there too much because I spend too much money.

24:22.620 --> 24:31.620
And then I went to a movie this week. I went and saw Kingdom of Heaven, and that was Kingdom of Boring.

24:31.620 --> 24:34.620
It looked like Kingdom of Boring from the trailer. I can't believe you actually went.

24:34.620 --> 24:39.620
This was father-son time, so, you know, it went because he wanted to see the movie, so...

24:39.620 --> 24:43.620
Did it have any true historical reference to it?

24:43.620 --> 24:47.620
It did, um, apparently the fighting, everything but the fighting was accurate.

24:47.620 --> 24:49.620
Okay, I have to see it.

24:49.620 --> 24:55.620
Um, but, really, it's just like, it was like, I've never actually sat through a movie where I said,

24:55.620 --> 25:02.620
Okay, is it over yet? Because it just kept going, and I really wanted to end, the battles were anticlimactic.

25:02.620 --> 25:09.860
And I can sense that Ridley Scott was trying to make it climactic, but it was just a, look,

25:09.860 --> 25:14.300
I'm filming a scene, but I'm shaking the camera a lot to make it look like something's happening,

25:14.300 --> 25:15.300
you know?

25:15.300 --> 25:16.300
It's just, no thanks.

25:16.300 --> 25:22.700
If I wanted to watch that, you know, I'll go have someone shoot an amateur film of like

25:22.700 --> 25:27.700
a Civil War reenactment or something like that, you know, it's just, really, I mean,

25:27.700 --> 25:28.700
steadier shots.

25:28.700 --> 25:31.500
It doesn't make like anything else that's happening, you know?

25:31.500 --> 25:34.540
My friend won free passes to see the Kingdom of Heaven.

25:34.540 --> 25:38.340
She actually entered an amateur strip contest, and that was part of the prize that she won.

25:38.340 --> 25:39.340
Go figure.

25:39.340 --> 25:40.340
Poor bastard.

25:40.340 --> 25:41.740
Is that punishment or something?

25:41.740 --> 25:42.740
I don't know.

25:42.740 --> 25:45.420
It was like, you should know better than taking your clothes off in public.

25:45.420 --> 25:46.660
You have to go see Kingdom of Heaven.

25:46.660 --> 25:50.920
I think I want to see it though, just because I'm a big history nut.

25:50.920 --> 25:54.020
She had those advanced screening passes, and she was like, I don't want to go.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.400
So she tried to give them to me, and I was like, I don't want to go.

25:57.400 --> 26:01.420
So she ended up leaving them on the table at the bar, and nobody took it the whole night.

26:01.420 --> 26:03.420
It's kinda sad.

26:03.420 --> 26:05.420
No, it's not sad.

26:05.420 --> 26:07.420
The movie looked like crap.

26:07.420 --> 26:09.420
Anyways, um, so then

26:09.420 --> 26:11.420
this week I've been just doing more

26:11.420 --> 26:13.420
work and stuff, lots of

26:13.420 --> 26:15.420
sales crap. Apparently now they're gonna

26:15.420 --> 26:17.420
be sending, they're gonna try to send

26:17.420 --> 26:19.420
my other two co-workers to E3.

26:19.420 --> 26:21.420
So they get

26:21.420 --> 26:23.420
paid to go, and I don't.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.420
Oh, that's fair.

26:25.420 --> 26:27.420
I think they're gonna comp me in some

26:27.420 --> 26:29.420
way if that's the case. And they're only gonna go for a day.

26:29.420 --> 26:34.420
And when I say go to E3, I mean go to the meetings at E3.

26:34.420 --> 26:37.420
Ooh, that's the fun part, you know, sitting in meetings.

26:37.420 --> 26:41.420
You know, I would actually be interested in going to that sometime, just, you know, to see what it's all about.

26:41.420 --> 26:42.420
I heard it's so boring.

26:42.420 --> 26:43.420
Oh.

26:43.420 --> 26:45.420
But anyways, anyways.

26:45.420 --> 26:48.420
So then, what else?

26:48.420 --> 26:54.420
Oh, I got a free game, another one, Area 51, and I have not played it.

26:54.420 --> 27:01.420
...contemplating selling. Yes, Area 51's been remade again, but this time it's not a shooting game, it's a first-person shooter.

27:01.420 --> 27:06.420
Oh, just what we need, another first-person shooting game. I'm so happy.

27:06.420 --> 27:12.420
Oh, honestly, yeah. There's, like, so many goddamn first-person shooters out there, it's not even funny, but whatever.

27:12.420 --> 27:17.420
So, yeah, that's pretty much all I've been doing, and just, you know, cleaning house and stuff.

27:17.420 --> 27:21.420
Fun stuff. Oh, I got to play Final Fantasy online the other day.

27:21.420 --> 27:29.580
day so it's finally finally been like having withdrawals very cool all right

27:29.580 --> 27:36.580
addict my weekend my day was okay I was kind of busy this weekend because a

27:36.580 --> 27:40.460
friend of mine was in town you know it's funny because we went to GameStop the

27:40.460 --> 27:45.020
other night and he had like $100 worth of credit that he could turn in to buy

27:45.020 --> 27:48.460
stuff he just had it lying around I don't I don't know how you just happen

27:48.460 --> 27:50.500
to have $100 worth of credit just lying around.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.300
Oh, look here.

27:51.300 --> 27:52.100
But no, he didn't.

27:52.100 --> 27:54.980
And he decided he wanted to get a PSP.

27:54.980 --> 27:56.860
And I was like, if you're going to get a PSP,

27:56.860 --> 27:58.180
you have to buy Luminous.

27:58.180 --> 27:59.600
But I think he was kind of starting

27:59.600 --> 28:01.140
to realize that when you get a PSP,

28:01.140 --> 28:03.260
not only do you have to start buying the PSP,

28:03.260 --> 28:04.460
then you've got to buy a memory stick,

28:04.460 --> 28:05.500
then you've got to buy a game.

28:05.500 --> 28:07.180
And it really starts to add up pretty quickly.

28:07.180 --> 28:09.740
You're not going to throw down $250 when you first get a PSP.

28:09.740 --> 28:12.740
You're going to end up throwing down more like $300 or $350.

28:12.740 --> 28:15.260
So he decided he wanted to get Darkstalkers.

28:15.260 --> 28:18.500
And lucky him, he actually found a used PSP.

28:18.500 --> 28:21.140
Somebody had just traded it in that morning, so he ended up

28:21.140 --> 28:21.780
getting one of those.

28:21.780 --> 28:22.740
So lucky him.

28:22.740 --> 28:25.180
And it appeared to be in great shape.

28:25.180 --> 28:28.980
And it already had a memory stick in it that was like 200

28:28.980 --> 28:30.740
something megs, so it was kind of nice.

28:30.740 --> 28:31.180
That's not bad.

28:31.180 --> 28:33.620
You know the 1 gigs are supposed to be out at GameStop.

28:33.620 --> 28:35.700
It was like about the best one you can get.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.860
So he got a really sweet deal on that.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.020
But anyway, the point is that I was like, you

28:40.020 --> 28:41.140
have to play Luminous.

28:41.140 --> 28:42.500
But he was like, I don't really have the money.

28:42.500 --> 28:43.340
So I'm like, OK, you know what?

28:43.340 --> 28:44.420
I'm going to get a PSP eventually.

28:44.420 --> 28:48.040
I'm just going to buy Luminous. So now I have a copy of Luminous with no system to play

28:48.040 --> 28:54.280
it on because he took it home with him. So, oh well. I figure I'll get a PSP eventually.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.480
I just have to wait for the E3 stuff to settle down. So we'll see what happens. Otherwise,

28:57.480 --> 29:03.800
my week was just really busy with work. I'm looking forward to next week and E3 and everything

29:03.800 --> 29:07.920
just so I can take my mind off my real job. Not that I dislike my real job because I love

29:07.920 --> 29:11.680
my job, but I'm looking forward to playing with this job for a little while. It'll be

29:11.680 --> 29:16.120
fun. And that's it. I'll talk about the rest of my week in a little bit. Let's talk to

29:16.120 --> 29:21.320
Tody. What's up with your week in your day? Well, let's see. First of all, I was driving

29:21.320 --> 29:24.880
around about half the day without my wallet. That was really fun because I didn't know

29:24.880 --> 29:28.840
where the hell I left that. I thought it might have been in some Mexican restaurant in like

29:28.840 --> 29:35.800
West Sacramento. So that kind of freaked me out. Oh, that place is good. Yeah. I didn't

29:35.800 --> 29:40.480
really do anything for Mother's Day. I just kind of, like I said, got some Mexican food.

29:40.480 --> 29:45.640
Only thing I've really been doing lately I actually started playing DDR again. I kind of quit like three months ago

29:46.820 --> 29:52.700
Started playing in the groove, and I've been looking for a new job too because I quit my old in which I've had for like

29:52.700 --> 29:54.220
four years

29:54.220 --> 29:56.740
Because I used to be like a computer technician there

29:56.740 --> 30:04.000
And then my new boss decided to switch the focus of my job from preparing computers to teaching science classes to children

30:04.540 --> 30:07.680
So I was like hell with that. Yeah, and you love children, right?

30:07.680 --> 30:11.680
Roseville Golf Land teaches you how to be a real good babysitter.

30:11.680 --> 30:16.680
Oh yes, yes. I actually have a group of little kids down there that want to kick my ass.

30:16.680 --> 30:18.680
It's really funny.

30:18.680 --> 30:21.680
Children are fine with the proper preparation and sauces.

30:21.680 --> 30:23.680
Yes.

30:23.680 --> 30:25.680
Get some basil going on there.

30:25.680 --> 30:27.680
Wait, wait, wait. You have kids?

30:27.680 --> 30:32.680
I say kids. I think they're like 17 or 18, but they're like 5 feet tall.

30:32.680 --> 30:33.680
Okay, okay.

30:33.680 --> 30:34.680
I don't really know.

30:34.680 --> 30:35.680
And they want to kick your ass?

30:35.680 --> 30:36.680
Yes.

30:36.680 --> 30:37.680
or something?

30:37.680 --> 30:38.680
No.

30:38.680 --> 30:39.680
Oh.

30:39.680 --> 30:44.320
I don't know if it's because, like, the Sacramento area is, like, so anti-bar rape or not, and

30:44.320 --> 30:48.880
you know, and I'm, like, the biggest bar rapist in the entire area, but it...

30:48.880 --> 30:50.680
Big enough to be on a registry?

30:50.680 --> 30:51.680
I think so.

30:51.680 --> 30:55.120
I think I could get on, like, maybe as law for bar rapists.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.860
Bugs, I know you're not too familiar with the DDR lingo, but when he says bar rapist,

30:58.860 --> 31:01.040
he doesn't mean that he, like, goes into bars and rapes people.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.040
Yeah.

31:02.040 --> 31:03.040
He's talking about DDR.

31:03.040 --> 31:04.040
Yeah.

31:04.040 --> 31:05.040
Like, you hold onto the bar.

31:05.040 --> 31:16.040
Ah, look. At least not that you know about anyway. Keep it that way. But that's about it for me.

31:16.040 --> 31:19.040
Alright. Bugged. How was your week? How was your day?

31:19.040 --> 31:23.040
I got to deal with Pepsi corporate office on Wednesday.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
Very nice.

31:24.040 --> 31:28.040
Yeah, they came out for a physical inventory. My boss never showed. The owner of the company never showed.

31:28.040 --> 31:35.040
They were more pissed that they didn't show them. We were like 400 cases off, which is 0.0015% deviance.

31:36.040 --> 31:39.040
400 cases? How many sodas are in a case?

31:39.040 --> 31:41.040
There's 12 cans per case.

31:41.040 --> 31:43.040
Oh, that's not too bad, I guess. But still, wow.

31:43.040 --> 31:46.040
Out of 272,000, 400 ain't crap.

31:47.040 --> 31:53.040
But we ended up going up to Yuba City, In-N-Out, and the Rusty Duck. That is good food.

31:53.040 --> 31:55.040
What the hell is the Rusty Duck?

31:55.040 --> 32:01.480
kind of like a hunting lodge for rich weirdos. Or, well, it seems like a hunting lodge for

32:01.480 --> 32:03.240
rich weirdos, but it's got really good food.

32:03.240 --> 32:07.400
Wow. Okay.

32:07.400 --> 32:12.720
And that was pretty much it. I wore my fugitive t-shirt yesterday or Friday, whatever the

32:12.720 --> 32:16.960
hell that day was, to give my boss the bad news that says fugitive, you never saw me.

32:16.960 --> 32:21.960
So dropped the paperwork off and ran the fuck home.

32:21.960 --> 32:26.960
amazing what kind of what would affect shirts can have on people's reactions to

32:26.960 --> 32:30.760
you I didn't tell him what it was all about it here's the paperwork and walked

32:30.760 --> 32:35.000
right on out and took off for home I'm thinking of a completely different

32:35.000 --> 32:37.660
circumstance but I'm kind of glad you got me think about this because I want

32:37.660 --> 32:41.920
to bring this up at some point I actually changed my picture on myspace

32:41.920 --> 32:48.260
lately to one of the pictures from the life is 65 Awards and I didn't post the

32:48.260 --> 32:51.880
life is 65 Awards on orange laundry calm I really need to do that I post them on

32:51.880 --> 32:55.380
my own journal so anybody that knows about that can know where to find that

32:55.380 --> 32:59.620
but I changed one of my pictures on Myspace to actually one of the pictures

32:59.620 --> 33:02.680
of the live 365 awards where I'm wearing one of those shirts that says tough guys

33:02.680 --> 33:06.500
wear pink and this one you know it's this typical hot topic shirt and um I

33:06.500 --> 33:09.400
swear to God like the day after I changed my picture the next day I logged

33:09.400 --> 33:13.900
on and like 15 girls had all sent me a friend request and none of them were

33:13.900 --> 33:23.300
over 18. Lucky bastard. You like him young, huh? Damn right. If I wanted to be like a,

33:23.300 --> 33:28.780
you know, pedophilia act or whatever they call them, child molester, MySpace would be

33:28.780 --> 33:34.660
heaven. It's great. Honestly, seriously, so if that's what you're into as underage girls,

33:34.660 --> 33:40.100
just dress metrosexual and sign up for a MySpace. I got it covered. How many friend

33:40.100 --> 33:42.900
requests, you've got the metrosexual thing down, how many friend requests from little

33:42.900 --> 33:44.900
What girls do you get on MySpace?

33:44.900 --> 33:46.900
Well, see, everybody lies about their age, so you can't tell.

33:46.900 --> 33:51.900
So if they're 19, 16, you just take off three years every single time.

33:51.900 --> 33:52.900
About three years is the rule?

33:52.900 --> 33:53.900
Yeah.

33:53.900 --> 33:55.900
All right.

33:55.900 --> 33:57.900
I don't lie on my age, but...

33:57.900 --> 33:58.900
I don't either, but...

33:58.900 --> 34:01.900
I mean, I just think it's funny, but I actually accepted all their frame requests,

34:01.900 --> 34:03.900
because then they all leave me comments going,

34:03.900 --> 34:05.900
oh, thanks for adding me, ah.

34:05.900 --> 34:08.900
And I'm like, oh, that makes my ego feel good.

34:08.900 --> 34:10.900
Yeah, I'm a MySpace friends whore.

34:10.900 --> 34:11.900
I'll just add random people.

34:11.900 --> 34:15.300
I don't know who they are. I don't really care either. I'm not actually on there to

34:15.300 --> 34:17.700
meet people, you know?

34:17.700 --> 34:21.820
My sister on MySpace has a thousand friends. One thousand friends.

34:21.820 --> 34:22.820
Damn.

34:22.820 --> 34:25.340
I'm like, how do you know that many people?

34:25.340 --> 34:26.340
Yeah.

34:26.340 --> 34:29.580
Like, I doubt I could think of a thousand people. So obviously she just randomly adds

34:29.580 --> 34:30.580
people.

34:30.580 --> 34:31.580
Yeah.

34:31.580 --> 34:32.580
She has a lot of bands, too.

34:32.580 --> 34:33.580
Oh, okay.

34:33.580 --> 34:34.580
But you know what's cool about MySpace is that you can have bands on your friends page

34:34.580 --> 34:38.260
so you can be all like, yeah, I'm friends with Garbage because Garbage has a MySpace

34:38.260 --> 34:39.260
and...

34:39.260 --> 34:40.260
Oh, yes.

34:40.260 --> 34:41.260
Freeze Pop has a thing on MySpace.

34:41.260 --> 34:43.260
Mr. T on mine.

35:11.260 --> 35:15.260
fights or something. Nice. And the other one's like a skateboarding video and then some death rock song.

35:15.260 --> 35:19.260
MySpace is where the internet goes to die. It really is, but

35:19.260 --> 35:23.260
sometimes you just want to feel

35:23.260 --> 35:27.260
cheap. Yeah. I don't know what the allure of MySpace is, because really... Everybody has

35:27.260 --> 35:31.260
one. It's an ugly site. There's no point to MySpace,

35:31.260 --> 35:35.260
really, but yet I feel strangely attracted

35:35.260 --> 35:39.260
to it. It's like the Fox Network. I don't... That was low.

35:39.260 --> 35:41.260
I don't know how to explain it.

35:41.260 --> 35:44.260
Speaking of Fox Network, family guy in an hour?

35:44.260 --> 35:48.260
Don't tell people that, because then they'll turn this show off to go listen to it.

35:48.260 --> 35:49.260
That's why there's TiVo.

35:49.260 --> 35:52.260
That's why, yeah, that's why you have TiVo and why you have BitTorrent.

35:52.260 --> 35:57.260
Just out of curiosity, does your sister have this really suggestive picture or anything up there?

35:57.260 --> 36:00.260
She used to, I think, but I don't think she does now.

36:00.260 --> 36:01.260
Okay, could you write down her-

36:01.260 --> 36:02.260
Dude, you even have my sister?

36:02.260 --> 36:03.260
Yeah, could you write-

36:03.260 --> 36:04.260
Dude!

36:04.260 --> 36:05.260
Kidding, kidding, kidding.

36:05.260 --> 36:06.260
Not cold.

36:06.260 --> 36:08.260
I don't know if my girlfriend's listening or not.

36:08.260 --> 36:12.260
My bad.

36:12.260 --> 36:17.260
Anyway, so, MySpace, yeah. End of story. Enough said.

36:17.260 --> 36:20.260
Notice how Orange Lounge does not have a community on MySpace.

36:20.260 --> 36:23.260
We have a community on just about every other website out there, but we do not have one on MySpace.

36:23.260 --> 36:26.260
Although, I think Jamie had hinted about starting one.

36:26.260 --> 36:29.260
I'm planning on doing it, since I actually have some free time to do that.

36:29.260 --> 36:32.260
Now, I'm surprised that you're on MySpace, aren't you?

36:32.260 --> 36:34.260
I joined it for some Gorillaz thing.

36:34.260 --> 36:37.260
Yeah, but have you actually looked at some of the other people's profiles on there?

36:37.260 --> 36:39.260
Let me send you my sister's page.

36:39.260 --> 36:43.260
But, you know what, I barely look at it only when I remember to.

36:43.260 --> 36:47.260
Do you remember when everybody had a GeoCities page?

36:47.260 --> 36:48.260
Oh!

36:48.260 --> 36:50.260
I still have a GeoCities page.

36:50.260 --> 36:53.260
They finally deleted mine three months ago.

36:53.260 --> 36:57.260
GeoCities, when everybody, you know, the rest of us that had real websites

36:57.260 --> 36:59.260
always called it GeoShitties.

36:59.260 --> 37:04.260
But GeoCities, man, hosted some ugly ass websites.

37:04.260 --> 37:12.260
I mean, seriously. And it would be like, you know, page dedicated to Britney Spears and it has like the MIDI file embedded in the page.

37:12.260 --> 37:25.260
No, let's see. Hey, you guys should see if my page is still up. It's www.geocities.com slash, um, nightmare underscore hunter. And then, uh, see if that-

37:25.260 --> 37:27.260
Do you have MIDI files embedded in your page?

37:27.260 --> 37:31.260
No, but I had a page dedicated to stupid people and how I hated them.

37:31.260 --> 37:33.260
Oh, now I have to look.

37:33.260 --> 37:42.100
I had stories. Geocities.com. My friend on the East Coast just recently made a page dedicated

37:42.100 --> 37:47.780
to her new car. This is Geocities for you. She actually made the font color match her

37:47.780 --> 37:53.780
car. Anyway, so it's Nightmare underscore Hunter? Yeah. Let me see if I can find it.

37:53.780 --> 37:58.100
I know this is great radio. I don't even know if it's still up anymore. I used to have a

37:58.100 --> 38:06.380
Lemmings page too. Yep, there it is. Oh my god, it's really there. Wow. Oh, this is great.

38:06.380 --> 38:12.580
Last update. September 26th, 01. Added DDR page. Let's see what links he has on the DDR

38:12.580 --> 38:19.300
page. I had sim files at the time. You have a Club Tropicana DWI. And a Quake 2 theme,

38:19.300 --> 38:24.300
DWI. And then this is great, and you see this shit on GeoCities pages all the time. Links

38:24.300 --> 38:32.340
to BMS files. Nothing under it. That's because I erased them. Where's the stupid people page?

38:32.340 --> 38:37.140
Encounters with stupid people. Let's see. Warning, the following are actual encounters

38:37.140 --> 38:44.780
with actual stupid people. August 25th, Saturday. Location, Roosevelt Galleria Electronics

38:44.780 --> 38:50.720
Boutique. Case name, stupid clerk. It was Saturday in the late afternoon. I'd never

38:50.720 --> 38:53.400
been to the Galleria before, so I thought, what the hell?

38:53.400 --> 38:57.420
I was looking for a Dex drive for my PlayStation so that I could upload my PlayStation saves

38:57.420 --> 38:58.560
to this site.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.520
Anyways, I found this third-party device called the MP Exchanger.

39:02.520 --> 39:05.880
So I walk up to the counter to pay, and I was greeted with stupidity.

39:05.880 --> 39:08.640
Here's an approximate dialogue of the conversation.

39:08.640 --> 39:11.320
Clerk, so you find everything all right?

39:11.320 --> 39:12.320
Looks down at my purchase.

39:12.320 --> 39:13.520
Me, yeah.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.160
Clerk, man, I was waiting for this thing to sell.

39:16.160 --> 39:18.440
I have no idea why anyone would need this for.

39:18.440 --> 39:20.880
I have no idea how it works or if it works.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.480
Me, it copies game saves to your PC off a memory card.

39:24.480 --> 39:26.720
Clerk, OK, would you like to buy insurance

39:26.720 --> 39:28.320
in case you break it within a year?

39:28.320 --> 39:29.760
No.

39:29.760 --> 39:32.480
Clerk, giggles, OK, that'll be $5,000.

39:32.480 --> 39:38.860
Giggles, me, looks at the cash register display,

39:38.860 --> 39:42.160
then hands the more on the correct amount of money, $29.95.

39:42.160 --> 39:43.720
Clerk, hands me the receipt.

39:43.720 --> 39:45.160
Let me know if that thing works.

39:45.160 --> 39:52.720
me walking out of the store. WHATEVER. How old were you when you wrote this? 21 probably?

39:52.720 --> 39:58.200
Yeah. WHATEVER. I don't think I actually went like that, but you know. Well that's what

39:58.200 --> 40:03.280
you put in, WHATEVER. Moral of the story, and by the way, moral is M-O-R-A-L-E. Okay,

40:03.280 --> 40:08.080
I was, you know, I don't care. Morale? No wait, no I'm kidding, nevermind, I'm thinking

40:08.080 --> 40:12.000
something else. When you see it in all fables, it's always morale of the story. I swear to

40:12.000 --> 40:17.440
God, that's what you see. No. I swear, like I had books and that's what it said. Never

40:17.440 --> 40:21.880
mind, forget it. Moral of the story, when dealing with the I think I'm funny clerk type,

40:21.880 --> 40:26.360
it's best to just ignore any attempt they make to make you laugh. Failure to do so will

40:26.360 --> 40:34.000
only prolong the torture. That's wonderful advice. The more you know. Okay, anyway, the

40:34.000 --> 40:41.200
other one on there is some stupid guy at Burger King or like McDonald's or something. Well,

40:41.200 --> 40:44.760
If you want to check that out, you can visit his old website there. It's fucking great.

40:44.760 --> 40:48.720
Anyway, it sucks. I want to see what other sites you have linked on here. I want to see

40:48.720 --> 40:54.400
what the cool sites were to visit back in 2001. Oh, you don't have a links page. Everybody

40:54.400 --> 41:01.760
had a links page. I didn't have a links page. You have a who am I. Your birth date on here,

41:01.760 --> 41:10.720
by the way, is listed as 9-11-01. Good job. I didn't want him to know how old I was.

41:10.720 --> 41:25.720
Mine is still floating around somewhere on the internet, although Geocities finally deleted it, but I have Dark Sakura's mostly evil shrine.

41:25.720 --> 41:27.720
I saw that years ago.

41:27.720 --> 41:28.720
That was me.

41:28.720 --> 41:35.720
And then I had a Bust A Move 2 site. I'm actually still up on the anime web turnpike.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.720
You know what's funny is all these people in our chat room right now, over at www.orangewormsauce.com,

41:39.720 --> 41:43.120
they're all looking up their GeoCities pages right now, and all I see in the chat right now is this,

41:43.120 --> 41:46.620
OMG! My site's still up! OMG! OMG! I can't believe it's still there! OMG!

41:46.620 --> 41:52.120
I haven't updated my site in like, four years. I'm surprised that's even up.

41:52.120 --> 41:54.220
That's great.

41:54.220 --> 41:55.620
Alright.

41:55.620 --> 42:00.020
Tody, by the way, your girlfriend is in chat and wants to know that your girlfriend's listening.

42:00.020 --> 42:03.120
Uh, yeah, I also just got a text a second ago that said,

42:03.120 --> 42:05.120
Bad Andrew! Yes, I'm listening!

42:05.120 --> 42:06.120
And I'm just like, oh shit!

42:06.120 --> 42:07.120
Uh-oh.

42:07.120 --> 42:09.120
Yeah, gotta watch what I say.

42:09.120 --> 42:11.120
He didn't mean anything by the underage girl thing.

42:11.120 --> 42:12.120
Yeah.

42:12.120 --> 42:13.120
It's all underage boys.

42:13.120 --> 42:14.120
Yeah.

42:14.120 --> 42:15.120
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

42:15.120 --> 42:16.120
Ah!

42:16.120 --> 42:20.320
Anyway, Todias, as long as you have the microphone, let's talk about our fabulous party we went

42:20.320 --> 42:21.320
to.

42:21.320 --> 42:22.320
Oh, yes.

42:22.320 --> 42:23.320
What night was it? Wednesday, Tuesday?

42:23.320 --> 42:24.320
Wednesday night.

42:24.320 --> 42:25.320
Wednesday night.

42:25.320 --> 42:26.320
Wednesday night.

42:26.320 --> 42:27.320
So how did you get hooked up with this?

42:27.320 --> 42:29.800
We went to our very first video game premiere, and it was for In the Groove, the new dancing

42:29.800 --> 42:31.920
game coming out on PlayStation 2.

42:31.920 --> 42:35.440
The controversial dancing game, I guess I really should say, because it seems like the

42:35.440 --> 42:39.060
dance game community is really divided over this In the Groove game.

42:39.060 --> 42:43.920
If you've been living under a rock, In the Groove is this game that was created by, and

42:43.920 --> 42:48.200
I think it's fair to say, fans of the DDR series are folks that made this game, but

42:48.200 --> 42:53.160
what they wanted to do was kind of improve on what they felt DDR was lacking on.

42:53.160 --> 42:56.640
But it's in no way like DDR.

42:56.640 --> 42:57.640
No way at all.

42:57.640 --> 43:01.800
But it's a completely different game, even though it has four arrows that scroll up that

43:01.800 --> 43:06.700
dance to in DDR machines mind you the upgrade it's nothing like DDR it's

43:06.700 --> 43:11.360
Mario versus that that's the greatest argument I read is that DDR versus in

43:11.360 --> 43:18.160
the group it's like Mario versus Sonic oh yeah you don't put a new sticker on

43:18.160 --> 43:21.040
your Nintendo case and suddenly put turn it into something but that's another

43:21.040 --> 43:25.800
story forget yeah despite how you feel about the game we got we got to go to

43:25.800 --> 43:30.200
this party and I don't you you got hooked up through I got up the itg freak

43:30.200 --> 43:38.200
And DDR Freak was kind enough to hook us up with passes because we don't count as a legitimate media source in the industry or something, I don't know what that was.

43:38.200 --> 43:44.200
We haven't really worked with Red Octane in the past, I don't even think they know who we are, so you know, it's cool.

43:44.200 --> 43:53.200
Actually, they do know who we are because they offered us a partnership deal a few years ago when I was hosting Shaft.

43:53.200 --> 43:55.200
How did I miss that?

43:55.200 --> 43:58.200
I think we tried to do the whole Red Octane thing out of the head.

43:58.200 --> 44:02.200
They know about us now for sure. Some of them might be listening even. Hi Red Octane, hi.

44:02.200 --> 44:06.200
I swear we're not going to bash this game. Anyway, no.

44:06.200 --> 44:10.200
I have things to say about it, but I'll ask Tody first. How was your drive down

44:10.200 --> 44:14.200
and what did you think when you got there and everything? What was it like?

44:14.200 --> 44:18.200
Well, we would have been on time, but you know, an hour of traffic, and then when we actually got to San Francisco

44:18.200 --> 44:22.200
we were like, oh hey, look, it's the 5th Street Garage. So we ended up going down

44:22.200 --> 44:26.200
10 blocks because there were no left turns on any of them, and down about another

44:26.200 --> 44:30.920
streets and another ten blocks back to get to the parking garage. That was a pain in

44:30.920 --> 44:35.000
the ass. And then we were, um, I hope this guy's not listening, but there was this creepy

44:35.000 --> 44:40.200
ass guy that just, like, approached me and my guest as we were walking up and just started

44:40.200 --> 44:45.280
asking us about, like, music fees and royalties and how much he should charge, like, Red Octane

44:45.280 --> 44:49.260
and stuff like that for his music. And it's like, get away from me. I don't know you.

44:49.260 --> 44:51.280
Please don't touch me. You know what? There might be a reason for

44:51.280 --> 44:55.080
that. It has to do with something else Red Octane mentioned this week. I'll get to that

44:55.080 --> 45:01.080
I was very confused, and he gave me his phone number when he left, which made me even more confused.

45:01.080 --> 45:02.080
Hot.

45:02.080 --> 45:04.080
Great calling! Great calling!

45:04.080 --> 45:05.080
Wait, you want to call him right now?

45:05.080 --> 45:06.080
I should have brought it.

45:06.080 --> 45:08.080
You want to call him right now on the show?

45:08.080 --> 45:11.080
I wish I brought it with me, you know, but...

45:11.080 --> 45:13.080
All right.

45:13.080 --> 45:17.080
All right, well, okay, so you got there, and what did you think when you got to the thing?

45:17.080 --> 45:24.080
Well, the place was a lot smaller than I thought it was going to be, but I think they were honestly expecting a lot more people to show up.

45:24.080 --> 45:49.080
I was actually surprised that there weren't as many people as I thought. Don't get me wrong, I kind of liked it that way. It was a really nice vibe there. I didn't really personally know a lot of people there. I did run into a few people in the scene such as yourself and a couple of people from other websites. Believe it or not, even though we're all quote-unquote competing websites, you know, we all sit down and have drinks. It's fun. And good people that run the other websites in the community.

45:49.080 --> 46:00.080
But if you think about it, like, DDR Freak had 10 passes to give away, but Monty Stell had 10 passes to give away, and the Groove Freak had 10 passes to give away, and if they all bring a guest, that's 60 people right there.

46:00.080 --> 46:02.080
There was maybe 60 people in the entire place.

46:02.080 --> 46:05.080
I know. I kind of was like, wow, Red Octane had a lot of people there.

46:05.080 --> 46:06.080
Yeah.

46:06.080 --> 46:10.080
Like, most of the people there were from Red Octane, it seemed, or some type of press or something.

46:10.080 --> 46:12.080
Yeah. Well, if I can rant here for a second.

46:12.080 --> 46:12.080
Sure.

46:12.080 --> 46:17.800
What I kept seeing was all these 15-year-olds.

46:17.800 --> 46:18.800
Why won't they let me in?

46:18.800 --> 46:22.040
Why won't they just let us have a past that doesn't let us have alcohol or something like

46:22.040 --> 46:23.040
that?

46:23.040 --> 46:25.820
It's like, well, you're completely missing the point of what this is.

46:25.820 --> 46:29.640
The employees want to go down there and just get fucking wasted.

46:29.640 --> 46:30.760
We completed a game.

46:30.760 --> 46:33.760
We're going to have a party, and they don't want to have to deal with 15-year-olds.

46:33.760 --> 46:39.240
I'm sorry to say it, but I talked to a bunch of Red Octane employees there.

46:39.240 --> 46:42.360
You know what?

46:42.360 --> 46:43.920
How do I put this nicely?

46:43.920 --> 46:47.300
Because a lot of people who listen to us are under 18.

46:47.300 --> 46:48.680
Don't take this the wrong way, you guys.

46:48.680 --> 46:53.480
There are a lot of great, intelligent people your age that would work very well at a party

46:53.480 --> 46:57.500
like this and you could have fit in and everybody would have had just a good time, but you have

46:57.500 --> 47:03.280
to realize that there are other people your age fucking it up for the rest of you, seriously.

47:03.280 --> 47:06.680
And they post on DDR Freak, MBomaniStyle, and IDG Freak.

47:06.680 --> 47:11.360
So they couldn't just open it up to anybody 18 and under because unfortunately one of

47:11.360 --> 47:14.320
the rotten apples would get in there and fuck it all up.

47:14.320 --> 47:20.480
Not to say that everybody over 21 is perfect, but luckily we lucked out, everybody there

47:20.480 --> 47:21.480
was very cool.

47:21.480 --> 47:23.480
I didn't run into anybody I just liked.

47:23.480 --> 47:27.360
And trust me, there's people over 21 that are stupid that I'm glad stayed far away from

47:27.360 --> 47:28.360
this.

47:28.360 --> 47:33.920
But I think there's just a certain maturity level expectation and that's just the way

47:33.920 --> 47:34.920
life is.

47:34.920 --> 47:36.380
I'm sorry to say it.

47:36.380 --> 47:42.020
But you know, someday you will have this conversation with other teenagers, so you know, I don't

47:42.020 --> 47:43.020
know what else to say.

47:43.020 --> 47:46.700
Yeah, more than anything else, I mean, there were so many Red Octane and Rockstar employees

47:46.700 --> 47:47.700
there.

47:47.700 --> 47:51.700
I mean, it was basically a party for them, not really for the fans of the game, so...

47:51.700 --> 47:55.260
Yeah, that's what I thought was also interesting about this.

47:55.260 --> 47:59.500
The party really wasn't for hardcore In the Groove players.

47:59.500 --> 48:02.820
I think that was the number one misconception about this, was that, oh, it was going to

48:02.820 --> 48:06.820
be the best of the best in the group players showing off this game.

48:06.820 --> 48:10.340
Whereas in fact, most people were just average.

48:10.340 --> 48:14.300
Toady was probably one of the best players there and there was only a handful, I could

48:14.300 --> 48:19.540
probably count them on one hand, how many 10, 11, 12 foot players were at this thing.

48:19.540 --> 48:23.340
I mean when people are looking at me and going, this guy is good, come on.

48:23.340 --> 48:30.140
Oh you got moves, I've seen them, I've seen them.

48:30.140 --> 48:36.220
So what I loved about it, though, is that there was an open bar, and the club was very

48:36.220 --> 48:37.220
posh.

48:37.220 --> 48:38.220
Yeah.

48:38.220 --> 48:39.220
It was nice.

48:39.220 --> 48:40.220
Honestly, these guys know how to throw a party.

48:40.220 --> 48:41.220
Oh, I agree.

48:41.220 --> 48:45.260
Despite how you may feel about In the Groove, the party was awesome.

48:45.260 --> 48:46.260
That was brilliant.

48:46.260 --> 48:47.260
Free sushi.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.260
Yeah.

48:48.260 --> 48:49.260
All that stuff.

48:49.260 --> 48:50.260
Oh, my gosh.

48:50.260 --> 48:51.260
Drink all night.

48:51.260 --> 48:52.260
In the Groove totally knows...

48:52.260 --> 48:53.260
I'm sorry.

48:53.260 --> 48:54.260
Red Octane.

48:54.260 --> 48:55.260
Stop rubbing it in.

48:55.260 --> 48:56.260
Sorry.

48:56.260 --> 48:57.260
Red Octane totally knows how to buy my love.

48:57.260 --> 48:58.260
Honestly.

48:58.260 --> 48:59.260
Oh, yeah.

48:59.260 --> 49:03.580
If they could buy off my opinion on this game, this would have been a great party to do it.

49:03.580 --> 49:04.580
But no, I thought...

49:04.580 --> 49:10.260
If they could buy off your opinion on this game and that game would have been Driver

49:10.260 --> 49:11.260
3.

49:11.260 --> 49:12.260
Yeah, I would have been giving Driver 3 reviews of the game.

49:12.260 --> 49:16.020
But okay, as far as the feelings for the game myself, okay, so I got to check out the home

49:16.020 --> 49:18.340
version of In the Groove on PlayStation 2.

49:18.340 --> 49:22.420
And as you guys know, I've always been, this is, and when I first reviewed In the Groove,

49:22.420 --> 49:27.540
this is what I said about it, it's not as bad as the people who are saying In the Groove

49:27.540 --> 49:32.580
should die and go away is saying. It's not that bad. But it's not as good as what the

49:32.580 --> 49:38.940
people who are saying, OMG, DDR is dead forever, ITG for life is saying. It's somewhere in

49:38.940 --> 49:44.780
the middle. That is how I still feel about this game even after seeing it at the show.

49:44.780 --> 49:51.180
I was actually more impressed. I didn't think the game would translate as well to the PlayStation

49:51.180 --> 49:57.020
as it did because you have to consider that, I mean, I don't, a lot of this game was kind

49:57.020 --> 50:02.500
of homebrew, really. It's kind of, StepMania was a homebrew thing and it kind of evolved

50:02.500 --> 50:06.160
from that, right? So a lot of this game was homebrew. It actually translates very well

50:06.160 --> 50:11.440
and very smoothly into a PlayStation 2 game, so I was pretty impressed with that. As far

50:11.440 --> 50:15.360
as the game itself, though, it's in the groove. You already have an opinion on this game,

50:15.360 --> 50:17.800
honestly. There's nothing I'm going to say that's going to change your mind one way or

50:17.800 --> 50:21.500
other. If you've played In the Groove in the arcade, you like it, you're going to like

50:21.500 --> 50:26.860
the home release. If you don't like it, you're not going to like it. So, I would recommend

50:26.860 --> 50:33.860
In the Groove to Dance Game fans. But I still would say, if it's your first game, I don't

50:34.220 --> 50:37.120
know. You may want to weigh your options a little bit. I think DDR has some more beginner

50:37.120 --> 50:41.140
accessible things. I think In the Groove is always going to be more for the hardcore niche

50:41.140 --> 50:42.100
player. That's mine.

50:42.100 --> 50:46.900
Well actually, the home version actually added a new training slash beginners mode that's

50:46.900 --> 50:51.380
not available in the arcade. Right, right. And I did notice that, but I was still...

50:51.380 --> 50:54.300
Yeah. I don't know, it's still...

50:54.300 --> 50:57.940
I don't know what it is. In the Groove, it just doesn't have that

50:57.940 --> 51:02.140
beginner warm fuzziness to it that DDR does. I can't explain it better than that.

51:02.140 --> 51:05.860
We didn't really grow up, so to speak, on it, I guess. I guess. That might be

51:05.860 --> 51:08.620
something to do with it. But, I mean, as long as they're not making any other

51:08.620 --> 51:11.500
games, and In the Groove is going to continue to challenge me, I'm just...

51:11.500 --> 51:14.980
I'm going to play it, you know, in the story. Honestly, the honest way I feel about it is

51:14.980 --> 51:17.620
I mean, and I know that might sound a little bit

51:17.620 --> 51:20.820
belittling, but it really is kind of a compliment that it

51:20.820 --> 51:23.860
is actually holding my attention for a new DDR.

51:23.860 --> 51:28.260
Because it's unfortunate, but Konami has kind of slowed down

51:28.260 --> 51:29.620
on the arcade stuff, at least.

51:29.620 --> 51:31.300
But this home version is a whole other world.

51:31.300 --> 51:33.500
We're going to get into later in the show, this is going to

51:33.500 --> 51:34.780
be a huge year for a dance game.

51:34.780 --> 51:37.780
That is now four dance games after this week.

51:37.780 --> 51:40.020
We know for sure there are four dance games coming out

51:40.020 --> 51:41.700
this year, and they all want your attention.

51:41.700 --> 51:44.020
But on the other hand, it's going to be a huge year for

51:44.020 --> 51:49.020
But honestly, most people who listen to this show aren't going to buy all four anyway, I think. I don't know.

51:49.020 --> 51:50.020
Probably.

51:50.020 --> 51:51.020
Probably.

51:51.020 --> 52:01.020
Well, the biggest compliment, though, that I had at the game, and I really want to credit Red Octane for doing this, is that they kept the timing windows in the game the same as the arcade.

52:01.020 --> 52:02.020
Yeah, that was cool.

52:02.020 --> 52:06.500
this is my that is my absolute biggest criticism whatsoever of all the home

52:06.500 --> 52:09.900
versions on for DDR games because you actually you get used to playing on

52:09.900 --> 52:14.440
those and you go to the arcade and you just suck you know you're you're

52:14.440 --> 52:17.300
terrible you're just off by a couple milliseconds and you start great

52:17.300 --> 52:19.980
attacking everything and you're like what the hell's going on at home I'm

52:19.980 --> 52:24.500
triple laying this so I'm really really glad that they kept that the same it's

52:24.500 --> 52:29.340
actually going to be able to improve your ability in the arcade well I'll

52:29.340 --> 52:32.780
tell you one thing I really liked and this was something that really surprised

52:32.780 --> 52:36.620
me about the party because I did not think I would be as impressed by this as

52:36.620 --> 52:40.780
I was was Red Octane's metal pad. Yes, I was wondering if you're gonna cover the

52:40.780 --> 52:46.860
afterburner. The afterburner is amazing I thought it was it's it's great yeah it's

52:46.860 --> 52:50.660
the best metal pad I've played on but of course I haven't played on that many but

52:50.660 --> 52:55.420
it's it's the best it's so responsive it's smooth it's great. Well I own two

52:55.420 --> 52:59.940
personalized cobalt fluxes, and I can easily say that I would rather have two

52:59.940 --> 53:03.740
afterburners. Do you know the other thing I noticed about the afterburners was just

53:03.740 --> 53:07.080
awesome? The way that they lock together, so you can kind of play doubles with the

53:07.080 --> 53:10.460
pads locked together. The only thing the afterburner is missing, seriously, is a

53:10.460 --> 53:15.900
bar. Yes, I was actually talking to a guy named Atma who works for Red Octane, and

53:15.900 --> 53:19.600
they actually have development going on for that. I don't know if it'll actually

53:19.600 --> 53:23.180
go through or not, but I was offering some suggestions, of course, because it's the

53:23.180 --> 53:27.180
Right, right. Now, you can't play these games without the bar, as you found out.

53:27.180 --> 53:29.180
It's quite difficult for me.

53:29.180 --> 53:35.180
And that's going to be a problem for this game coming home, but interesting creative solutions. Now, you tried something.

53:35.180 --> 53:38.180
It didn't work too well. I tried.

53:38.180 --> 53:41.180
What did you try to do as a bar replacement at the party?

53:41.180 --> 53:46.180
Well, since I didn't really have any chairs there, I basically just grabbed one of these metal bar stools.

53:46.180 --> 53:48.180
The second I brought it over there

53:48.180 --> 53:54.940
I was immediately assaulted by a whole bunch of like bar staff and red octane employees that told me that I couldn't do this

53:54.940 --> 53:59.880
There was you know liabilities and crap like that like I'd fall and crack my face open or something

54:00.420 --> 54:02.420
So that really irritated me

54:03.660 --> 54:05.180
but

54:05.180 --> 54:07.180
It was and I was so disappointed to this

54:07.180 --> 54:10.740
I don't know if you've checked out orange launch radio.com, but we have picture galleries up on there

54:10.740 --> 54:13.960
I saw my ass on the picture gallery multiple times. Yes

54:13.960 --> 54:21.240
I was in the other room at that moment, but I heard After Burner, not only are they ripping

54:21.240 --> 54:23.400
off TDR, now they're ripping off SEGA.

54:23.400 --> 54:26.600
Okay, well, well, well, wait.

54:26.600 --> 54:30.640
I think we all know that this is not, that the new After Burner pad has nothing to do

54:30.640 --> 54:32.400
with everybody's favorite jet flying game.

54:32.400 --> 54:33.400
No, I know.

54:33.400 --> 54:36.200
I know, but this just makes me want to hook up my 32X.

54:36.200 --> 54:37.200
I know you're teasing.

54:37.200 --> 54:42.840
But the After Burner pads, honestly, I was more impressed with the After Burner pads

54:42.840 --> 54:47.000
anything in the show. Yeah. I thought they were great. Yeah, is that the first metal

54:47.000 --> 54:51.160
pad that really has a system of, like, the depressed arrows, like the arcade? I know

54:51.160 --> 54:55.700
the Cobalt Flux is completely flat, and I've had, like, a My My box, which was pretty much

54:55.700 --> 54:59.560
flat also. I'm going to ask our expert here, because I don't know, really, your pads that

54:59.560 --> 55:06.560
you built had it. My pads rock, that's why, because I put my hard, you know, I put a lot

55:06.560 --> 55:16.340
hard effort into getting them well built working it's a little different but my

55:16.340 --> 55:22.440
pads rock they weigh a ton but as far as depresseros yeah most of them were like

55:22.440 --> 55:25.680
flat and they're lame like I remember those old metal pads you can get off the

55:25.680 --> 55:29.920
eBay or whatever I remember I bought no metal pads from they end up selling them

55:29.920 --> 55:34.920
as someone they put the first time I stepped on it it bent I'm like why did

55:34.920 --> 55:36.920
Did it bend? That's weird.

55:36.920 --> 55:38.920
Cause it made tin foil enough.

55:38.920 --> 55:41.920
I'm sorry if I sound like I was knocking your metal pads, Loki,

55:41.920 --> 55:44.920
but these pads actually worked for more than 15 minutes.

55:44.920 --> 55:47.920
Cause mine aren't grounded, you dumbass.

55:47.920 --> 55:48.920
Shit.

55:48.920 --> 55:52.920
Once I put that wire on, man, those fucking pads are gonna rock.

55:52.920 --> 55:54.920
Dude, but these pads at the show, you have to...

55:54.920 --> 55:57.920
They were taking abuse. I saw Girls in Heels playing on these pads.

55:57.920 --> 56:00.920
They were taking a lot of abuse, and they were still holding up great.

56:00.920 --> 56:01.920
Stupid women.

56:01.920 --> 56:10.920
Stop it. Stop it now. The girls I met were actually very nice. I actually met a lot of people at the show that were just kind of from the scene.

56:10.920 --> 56:20.920
You know, and I've bashed a lot on the In The Groove community, and I kind of apologize to these people that I met the other night because they were actually really great folks.

56:20.920 --> 56:24.920
You just have to remember there's a couple bad apples ruining the barrel out there because there are some folks out in the community that are like,

56:24.920 --> 56:33.040
DDR is dead. If you still play DDR you're a fag. Stop being such a fag. Stop fagging

56:33.040 --> 56:39.020
up the dance scene. So, and that's just, I just can't stand that attitude. Especially

56:39.020 --> 56:46.560
when you considered it in the groove. I don't care how you spin it. In the groove is a deviation

56:46.560 --> 56:52.780
of the DDR game. You cannot spin this any other way that I will believe you that this

56:52.780 --> 56:55.920
This is not some type of at least inspired by DDR.

56:55.920 --> 56:57.620
You cannot spin it.

56:57.620 --> 56:59.820
Had there been no DDR, there would be no In the Groove.

56:59.820 --> 57:00.820
Absolute.

57:00.820 --> 57:01.820
Period.

57:01.820 --> 57:02.820
End of sentence.

57:02.820 --> 57:03.820
And that sums it up there.

57:03.820 --> 57:08.480
So, and these kids out there that are just saying, you know, DDR, have no respect for

57:08.480 --> 57:09.820
where In the Groove came from.

57:09.820 --> 57:12.940
Hello, DDR fans, built In the Groove!

57:12.940 --> 57:16.300
I'm done.

57:16.300 --> 57:22.300
And they also built stupid, uh, what was it, that Dancing in Stage, um, Unleashed, or whatever.

57:22.300 --> 57:29.580
Oh, well, stupid Konami, they can't get anything right as far as, like, you know, the new arcade

57:29.580 --> 57:30.580
games.

57:30.580 --> 57:36.560
I mean, I swear, you know, I don't know, I'm really curious to see what they're gonna come

57:36.560 --> 57:40.660
up with for this year's E3, you know.

57:40.660 --> 57:42.860
I-Toy, that was a great idea!

57:42.860 --> 57:43.860
Let's do that again!

57:43.860 --> 57:46.860
You know what? I think people were way too harsh on the iToy thing.

57:46.860 --> 57:48.860
Oh yeah, because you know...

57:48.860 --> 57:50.860
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Hold on a minute.

57:50.860 --> 57:53.860
I don't want to get too far off topic here. I'm not done within the groove yet.

57:53.860 --> 57:55.860
But the iToy thing, look at it this way.

57:55.860 --> 57:59.860
For those of us that are into DDR and all that stuff, it was kind of silly.

57:59.860 --> 58:03.860
But let's face it, DDR was not just made for us.

58:03.860 --> 58:06.860
It was also made for 9-year-old girls to have at their slumber parties.

58:06.860 --> 58:08.860
Like it or not.

58:08.860 --> 58:11.860
And this is a topic I'm going to bring back later when we start talking about Extreme 2.

58:11.860 --> 58:16.980
too. Nine-year-old girls and their slumber parties think this iToy shit's hilarious.

58:16.980 --> 58:20.000
Not that I know firsthand. I've just, you know, heard things and read about them on

58:20.000 --> 58:25.540
certain internet websites. iToy was not made for you. It was not made for you, the fan.

58:25.540 --> 58:30.300
It was made to make DDR more accessible and more showy and flashy. And that's why DDR

58:30.300 --> 58:35.100
does so well because it's such a showy, flashy game. And that's something that In the Groove,

58:35.100 --> 58:39.380
by the way, completely lacks, is showiness and flashiness. In the Groove looks like just

58:39.380 --> 58:45.720
industrial, sad, sad, gothic thing. Not to knock the game quality, because it's a fun

58:45.720 --> 58:46.720
game, but it looks sad.

58:46.720 --> 58:47.720
It looks too American.

58:47.720 --> 58:50.640
It looks, yeah. Sadly, it looks too American. Anyway.

58:50.640 --> 58:56.760
Well, yeah, because, you know, I love the iToy game where you hit the stupid ball around,

58:56.760 --> 59:01.360
and you spend, like, 15 minutes trying to get the ball to go where you want it to go,

59:01.360 --> 59:03.560
and it sucks, and it's so frustrating.

59:03.560 --> 59:07.480
I'm already pissed off at Sonic Team for not doing a real Knights game, and instead doing

59:07.480 --> 59:14.640
nights and that's that I toy collection what yeah I remember that a Sega

59:14.640 --> 59:19.160
collection thing that they were doing the I toy with it three uh-huh well

59:19.160 --> 59:23.400
there's a night's game in it why couldn't they just make nights I'm

59:23.400 --> 59:27.760
sorry I had to rant oh yeah why couldn't they just freakin make samba on ps2

59:27.760 --> 59:32.240
somebody me go there just needs to be given a whole shitload of money and do

59:32.240 --> 59:35.960
nothing but make games that I tell them to okay and of course we have somebody

59:35.960 --> 59:40.120
in our chat room right now that says SSJ 100 Matt says iToy games equal great

59:40.120 --> 59:44.600
games to play with your penis. You always know somebody's got to be the

59:44.600 --> 59:54.500
jokester. Ass! Alright, I don't think that'll work. Back to In the Groove. I know. Back to In the

59:54.500 --> 59:57.080
Groove for a minute, alright, before we get on all these other tangents. Alright,

59:57.080 --> 01:00:02.120
so In the Groove. Do I recommend the game? If you like In the Groove, yes. If

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.480
you don't know how you feel about it, at least check it out. Form your own

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:08.880
opinion, don't listen to people on the internet. That is my opinion on In The Groove, don't

01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:12.440
listen to people on the internet, play the game for yourself and form your own opinion.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:19.120
There it is. Honestly, you know what this is right here? This is the equivalent of like

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:24.760
say, ok, you've got your hair care products and stuff like that, ok, and you've got, you

01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:30.360
know, for women they have their conditioner and stuff, and then guys won't buy that crap

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:35.180
because they're like, that's gay, I'm not going to put that gay shit in my hair, so

01:00:35.180 --> 01:00:38.080
and then they come up with something cool, extreme gel!

01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:40.180
Okay, so you buy this extreme gel.

01:00:40.180 --> 01:00:42.260
It's basically the same damn thing as the woman's pride,

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:44.060
but repackaged, so you buy it.

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:45.420
This is what In the Groove is.

01:00:45.420 --> 01:00:48.540
In the Groove is the Dance Dance Revolution game

01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:50.740
that you can play and not feel gay about.

01:00:50.740 --> 01:00:52.080
That's what it is.

01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.020
That is quite possibly the best analogy

01:00:56.020 --> 01:00:58.420
for this whole damn thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.060
Congratulations, hats off to you.

01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:03.100
People should post that on every forum.

01:01:03.100 --> 01:01:05.100
That's all it is. That's really what it is.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.100
You better copyright that. You better copyright it.

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:10.100
It's the men's suave of the dancing world.

01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:12.100
It's P.H. Balance for a guy.

01:01:12.100 --> 01:01:14.100
Exactly! They have that crap now.

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.100
P.H. Balance for my ass.

01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:19.100
If it wasn't P.H. Balance, you know, I'd just put that shit on.

01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:21.100
Oh my God, it burns!

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:24.100
No, but anyways. Yeah.

01:01:24.100 --> 01:01:27.100
Toady, your thoughts?

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:30.100
Well, uh, I've already kind of been an ITG fanboy.

01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:34.740
I mean, the first time I played it, I really thought it was pretty much just gimmicky bullshit,

01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.740
you know?

01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740
I'm like, mines?

01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:37.740
You know, what the fuck is this?

01:01:37.740 --> 01:01:38.740
Who cares, you know?

01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:41.000
I actually tried to do my first hand plant the other day.

01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:42.200
I will never do that again.

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.740
I burst a couple veins in my hand.

01:01:44.740 --> 01:01:46.060
I threw out my back!

01:01:46.060 --> 01:01:47.060
Alright!

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:50.720
But, I mean, the more I played it, the more I liked it, and like I said, they're not making

01:01:50.720 --> 01:01:52.900
any more DDR, so I'm going to keep playing it.

01:01:52.900 --> 01:01:56.700
But I mean, I was impressed with the home version, so.

01:01:56.700 --> 01:02:01.380
They got some stuff from ITG2 on here, so it should be pretty good.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:04.960
They didn't fuck with the timing windows, so I'm happy.

01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:05.960
I got it pre-ordered.

01:02:05.960 --> 01:02:06.960
You know what?

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:11.100
I'm going to pick it up, because my opinion of In the Groove is, even though I say I'm

01:02:11.100 --> 01:02:12.380
on the fence, it's favorable.

01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:16.260
I think it's only going to be like 30 bucks, so I'm going to pick it up.

01:02:16.260 --> 01:02:17.700
You know, why not?

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:19.780
The DDR games aren't going to be out until fall.

01:02:19.780 --> 01:02:21.460
I'm going to pick up these games.

01:02:21.460 --> 01:02:25.700
I think most people will.

01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.100
I will soon.

01:02:28.100 --> 01:02:31.700
I don't know if Red Octane is still doing it, but before, if you pre-ordered, they gave

01:02:31.700 --> 01:02:35.300
you a whole bunch of gimmicky shit with it, like t-shirts and keychains.

01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:38.420
So basically all this stuff we got at the launch party for free.

01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:40.260
They gave away for free at the show.

01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:43.180
You know what Jason told me today, and I haven't seen this post on the internet, but there's

01:02:43.180 --> 01:02:47.220
a rumor on the internet going around that all the people in attendance from the websites,

01:02:47.220 --> 01:02:50.580
Us, BimaniStyle, and stuff, DDRFreak, who else was being represented there?

01:02:50.580 --> 01:02:55.660
I know Us, BimaniStyle, DDRFreak, ITGFreak, I didn't meet anybody from that site.

01:02:55.660 --> 01:03:01.660
The rumors going around that we all got advanced copies of In the Groove for the Playstation.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:04.660
Should we just perpetuate that rumor just to irritate people?

01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:08.660
No, but if anybody wants to send me a copy of the game, I would love to have it.

01:03:08.660 --> 01:03:12.660
If you want to send me an advanced copy, hit me up offline and I'll give you the address.

01:03:12.660 --> 01:03:14.660
But that rumor as it stands is completely false.

01:03:14.660 --> 01:03:17.660
We got shirts and keychains and other cute little things.

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:18.660
Lots of beer.

01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:20.660
And alcohol, which is great.

01:03:20.660 --> 01:03:22.660
Like I said, Red Octane knows how to throw a party.

01:03:22.660 --> 01:03:25.540
I thought that bar was very cool, and I loved how we took

01:03:25.540 --> 01:03:27.420
over the media room at one point towards the end of the

01:03:27.420 --> 01:03:29.460
evening, and I had a great time, met some good people.

01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:32.620
And honestly, I think what this did, it made me a little

01:03:32.620 --> 01:03:35.340
more favorable of the In the Groove community as a whole,

01:03:35.340 --> 01:03:38.160
because I know now that there are good people in the

01:03:38.160 --> 01:03:40.580
community that aren't ruining it for everybody else, so

01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:41.260
that's good.

01:03:41.260 --> 01:03:48.160
And I think between that and the news that Red Octane came

01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:51.600
out with later in the week, I'm actually really respecting

01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:57.660
Red Octane's trying to do. I think Red Octane is trying to play up to the music

01:03:57.660 --> 01:04:01.120
fan base and put stuff, music gaming fan base and put stuff out there that people

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:04.600
want. Well, making lots of money. Yeah, I mean, and it is all about money, but I

01:04:04.600 --> 01:04:08.700
have to admit the whole thing, while it didn't really change my opinion on

01:04:08.700 --> 01:04:12.160
In the Groove per se, it really upped my respect for Red Octane and what

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:15.680
they're trying to do. And of course there was a rumor going around the party

01:04:15.680 --> 01:04:19.000
that Red Octane was going to do a second music game, which we found out about

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.640
about later in the week and we'll get into that a little later in the show.

01:04:23.640 --> 01:04:26.360
Anyway, for now, I think what we'll do is we'll do a little bit of a break. Oh, actually,

01:04:26.360 --> 01:04:30.520
I want to respond to some chatroom comments before we get a break. One thing somebody

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:35.400
said, Kuwabara, and I'm sorry if I mispronounced that, said, I don't feel gay when I play DDR.

01:04:35.400 --> 01:04:40.520
Well, you know, okay, and that's true, you shouldn't, because dance games do not have

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:44.480
a sexuality. I think Loki's comment, though, you have to remember is more towards what

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.300
but the general public views these games as we, as you folks who are geeky enough to tune

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.180
into a music station that is towards these dance games, and you know, us in the community,

01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:58.020
we know it's not gay, and we know, we have fun with it, but you have to remember the

01:04:58.020 --> 01:05:02.140
average, you know, Joe Q jock guy that comes in an arcade, you know.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.060
Yeah, just yesterday at RVGO, one of my friends had that problem, two little dumbass jocks

01:05:06.060 --> 01:05:10.540
jumped on the pad, started acting like, you know, little monkeys or whatever, and we're

01:05:10.540 --> 01:05:14.300
both standing there with like our girlfriends, he's like, you guys are queers, like, gave

01:05:14.300 --> 01:05:15.300
Give them a thumbs up.

01:05:15.300 --> 01:05:16.300
Haha.

01:05:16.300 --> 01:05:17.300
See you later.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.740
Well, you know what I used to do to those people, apart from having them kicked out

01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:20.740
of the arcade?

01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.380
Yeah, but they don't exactly call you queer.

01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.380
I mean...

01:05:24.380 --> 01:05:28.260
But, no, but they still, you know, get up and act all asshole-ish on the machine.

01:05:28.260 --> 01:05:32.860
So, my favorite circumstance is when I went up to these guys and said, okay, I'll pay.

01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.860
But I picked the songs.

01:05:35.860 --> 01:05:37.060
And what was it that I picked?

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:38.300
It was something fairly vicious.

01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:39.300
What rhythm and police?

01:05:39.300 --> 01:05:40.300
Yeah, it was something pretty mean.

01:05:40.300 --> 01:05:41.300
Yeah.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.300
It was cool.

01:05:42.300 --> 01:05:44.820
And I went, ugh.

01:05:44.820 --> 01:05:47.620
Yeah, I won't challenge anybody unless it's for like $40 a game.

01:05:47.620 --> 01:05:49.300
I'm like, don't waste my time.

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:50.340
But no.

01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:52.500
You want to play a five-time tournament winner?

01:05:52.500 --> 01:05:54.140
$40 a game, asshole.

01:05:54.140 --> 01:05:55.140
That's what you're doing.

01:05:55.140 --> 01:05:56.700
I'm not wasting my time with you.

01:05:56.700 --> 01:05:59.500
But my whole point with this was that I showed them

01:05:59.500 --> 01:06:01.300
just exactly how stupid they were being.

01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:01.860
Yeah, it's great.

01:06:01.860 --> 01:06:04.060
And then usually, there's other people that they get up and do

01:06:04.060 --> 01:06:05.020
that I have them kicked out of the arcade.

01:06:05.020 --> 01:06:06.440
You made a kid cry once.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.700
That was the most beautiful thing ever.

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:09.100
It wasn't just you, but everybody.

01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.260
Because you did something, and then we all gathered around,

01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:15.740
we were like yeah do it do it do it you stupid kid do it and he like ran off

01:06:15.740 --> 01:06:19.980
into the bathroom and you know he was crying yeah well like this when we were

01:06:19.980 --> 01:06:23.020
playing pat-a-pat of those people who are getting back there and the one that

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:27.420
did not to me in the shoulder you know doing fake whatever I had like seven

01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:32.620
people kicked out the arcade that night Wow I used to be until I stopped because

01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:35.980
I stopped going right after that I used to have people kicked out of the arcade

01:06:35.980 --> 01:06:39.980
every time I was there because I wouldn't stand for it I would not stand

01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:43.980
to go into an arcade and see people acting like complete stupid idiots when the whole

01:06:43.980 --> 01:06:47.660
purpose of going to an arcade is to enjoy yourself and have a good time.

01:06:47.660 --> 01:06:48.660
Yeah.

01:06:48.660 --> 01:06:49.660
Alright.

01:06:49.660 --> 01:06:50.660
Alright.

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:53.220
Anyway, what we're gonna do now, we're gonna go to a break because we've been sitting here

01:06:53.220 --> 01:06:54.220
for a while dishing on In the Groove.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.700
We're gonna come back, we're gonna talk about now what Konami's up to because everything

01:06:57.700 --> 01:06:59.060
has just hit the fan this week.

01:06:59.060 --> 01:07:03.700
We were, it was seriously like you could see the tumbleweed flying across, you know, the

01:07:03.700 --> 01:07:08.740
Bomani scene has been dead and now just seriously, like over the weekend, bam, it all hit.

01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:11.980
So we're going to talk about what now Konami's up to right after this break.

01:07:11.980 --> 01:07:14.580
In this break, since we've been talking a little bit about In the Groove, I figured

01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:17.580
I'd humored the In the Groove fans with some music from In the Groove.

01:07:17.580 --> 01:07:19.940
And in case you haven't actually played the game, you can hear what some of the music

01:07:19.940 --> 01:07:20.940
sounds like.

01:07:20.940 --> 01:07:23.920
So we're going to start it off with some Nina with Fly With Me, and we'll be back with more

01:07:23.920 --> 01:07:30.920
Orange Launch Radio after this.

01:07:53.920 --> 01:08:03.920
But I will be like a bird in the sky

01:08:03.920 --> 01:08:10.920
Finding your way to my home

01:08:10.920 --> 01:08:25.920
We like a bird, you have scarred my heart

01:08:25.920 --> 01:08:35.920
We like a bird, you have scarred my heart

01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:43.920
Free like a bird in the sky

01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:49.920
I'm in your way to my heart

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:55.920
Come play with me

01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:03.920
Come play with me

01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:13.920
Come play with me, come play with me

01:10:03.920 --> 01:10:19.920
Don't promise me a world that you can't figure out

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.920
And you cannot escape

01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:26.920
Don't promise me freedom

01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:33.920
Don't promise me a bridge That you can't cross at all

01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:42.920
Don't promise me a light That you can't knock at all

01:10:42.920 --> 01:10:44.920
Don't promise me

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:19.920
You've got to get me out of here, you've got to get me out of here, you've got to get me

01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:46.240
MC confusion, I'm front a lot If I were MC from a little, I'd be tellin'

01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:49.160
you only ever what I'm not But I am the most frontin' this

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:52.320
Carvin' off the opposition Lil' son, just to confuse you

01:11:52.320 --> 01:11:55.640
Whippin' like a villain, I got conundrums Your MC head, they're gonna fill in

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:59.800
Sillin', affect the mock you made My dexterity and 20 on the skills of display

01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:04.560
That's alright, I'll take it as a compliment Shows you no nerd's course, it's dead

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560
Which MC was that?

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:07.840
I can't recollect I heard him on the internet

01:12:07.840 --> 01:12:10.920
And it was MC front or somethin' But I didn't hit save

01:12:10.920 --> 01:12:12.920
Which MC was that? I couldn't say

01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:18.920
Maybe it was MC matter of fact

01:12:18.920 --> 01:12:21.420
He got the authenticity, easy riding his act

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:23.420
Always speaking the truth, never fronts one bit

01:12:23.420 --> 01:12:25.420
He and DJ so sincere, don't quit

01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.920
But I think for some reason that it wasn't him

01:12:27.920 --> 01:12:29.920
Wait, was it MC out on our limb?

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.420
With the very risky dappin'?

01:12:31.420 --> 01:12:32.920
Don't know what happened to the time

01:12:32.920 --> 01:12:34.420
Global contortion is squeezin'

01:12:34.420 --> 01:12:35.920
Tongue portions sublime on the mic

01:12:35.920 --> 01:12:37.420
Except for when the bow's breakin'

01:12:37.420 --> 01:12:38.920
Kicked him out the liner, mistaked him

01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.420
Yo, it was definitely MC wrong Rockin' jam after jam of inaccurate songs

01:12:43.420 --> 01:12:47.920
Then again they quipped the band MC in sight Striking suckers for bling with the lyrical light

01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:52.420
Must confess I'm hard pressed to be certain Was it MC hot behind the curtain callin'?

01:12:52.420 --> 01:12:56.420
Pay no attention to the man on the mic Must be the wizard when he rhymes so tight

01:12:56.420 --> 01:13:00.420
You're havin' difficulty dredgin' out your brain The fact is which MC was that?

01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:04.920
Which MC was that? I can't quite collect I heard him on the internet and it was MC front

01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:11.160
front or something but I didn't hit save which MC was that? I couldn't say. I couldn't say.

01:13:13.320 --> 01:13:18.280
Step up Poindexter, act smarter than you are about to pull the MC name out the jar and whoever

01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:23.720
gets closest wins a nine-sided die and a gift certificate to prize yo. The moniker is MC Front

01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:28.920
a lot. I got a plus one bag, an earth core hip-hop and my mail list busted. 100's on famous.

01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:30.920
It's unbelievable nobody know what my name is

01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:00.720
We all want destiny

01:14:00.720 --> 01:14:02.720
But we are floating through the clouds

01:14:02.720 --> 01:14:04.720
And someday we'll see

01:14:04.720 --> 01:14:06.920
That only when we dance we'll tomb

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:11.720
Cause we're like animals on the run

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:13.520
La di da da da

01:14:13.520 --> 01:14:15.420
Li da di da da

01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:16.820
La di da da

01:14:16.820 --> 01:14:18.980
We are the animals on the run

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.120
La di da da da

01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:22.020
Li da di da da

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:25.520
La-di-da-da, we're all like planets through the sun

01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:32.720
La-di-da-da, we're all like planets through the sun

01:14:39.520 --> 01:14:41.020
Talk about us, you and me

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:42.820
Hey, can't you see we'll never be free?

01:14:42.820 --> 01:14:44.720
It's more, it's more like us

01:14:44.720 --> 01:14:46.520
Down to back, we can't discuss

01:14:46.520 --> 01:14:48.320
We're demons of love and peace

01:14:48.320 --> 01:14:50.020
But in the end, we're on our knees

01:15:20.020 --> 01:15:21.020
La de da da da, da de da da da

01:15:22.020 --> 01:15:23.020
La de da da da, da de da da da

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:25.020
La de da da da, da de da da da

01:15:26.020 --> 01:15:27.020
We roll like lemons on the side

01:15:28.020 --> 01:15:29.020
La de da da da, da de da da

01:15:30.020 --> 01:15:31.020
La de da da da, da de da da

01:15:32.020 --> 01:15:33.020
We are the lemons on the run

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:34.780
Run, run, run, run, run

01:15:40.020 --> 01:15:41.520
La de da da da, da de da da da

01:15:46.020 --> 01:15:48.520
Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio

01:15:48.520 --> 01:15:52.520
because real radio makes Captain Jack cry.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:22.520
They've been trying to keep quiet about some of the things they're going to be doing at E3.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.520
You know, they like to surprise us. I think in Konami's list...

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:30.520
If they were trying to be quiet about it, why did they give it to GamePro?

01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:33.520
Let me get there for a minute, damn you.

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:40.520
Alright, so usually, you know, they don't announce their stuff until it's getting closer to E3 time,

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.520
and you know, they save most their stuff for the show.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.520
But this year, some of the stuff's gotten out early.

01:16:45.520 --> 01:16:53.120
Actually IGN already blew the lid on the DDR with Mario is definitely going to be showing

01:16:53.120 --> 01:16:54.120
up.

01:16:54.120 --> 01:16:55.380
And karaoke revolution 4.

01:16:55.380 --> 01:16:57.800
And they also blew the lid on karaoke revolution 4.

01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:03.640
And now what happened this week is that game pro magazine, their website, remember last

01:17:03.640 --> 01:17:04.640
year?

01:17:04.640 --> 01:17:05.640
Yeah I know that happened last year too.

01:17:05.640 --> 01:17:06.640
Shame shame.

01:17:06.640 --> 01:17:09.080
Well they spoiled all the unlocks on DDR extreme last year.

01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:14.320
And now what they did this year is they actually blew the lid on some big things going on.

01:17:14.320 --> 01:17:20.600
They actually have Ultramix 3 and Extreme 2, and some very observant observers over

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:25.620
on DERFreak.com actually found these while they were surfing through GamePro's site.

01:17:25.620 --> 01:17:30.040
So the first one that we have details leaked on was Ultramix 3.

01:17:30.040 --> 01:17:35.360
Now, again, I think most people assumed both these games were going to be coming, but we

01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:40.860
have no idea in what shape or form these games are going to take, you know, especially with

01:17:40.860 --> 01:17:45.860
UltraMix 3, because UltraMix is kind of, the PlayStation 1s have always kind of a little

01:17:45.860 --> 01:17:50.300
bit, at least until DDR Extreme, they've always kind of taken the form of their Japanese releases

01:17:50.300 --> 01:17:53.020
in the arcade, but UltraMix has kind of always been doing its own thing.

01:17:53.020 --> 01:17:56.100
So I think UltraMix 3 especially are very curious to see what's going to happen with

01:17:56.100 --> 01:17:57.100
that.

01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.840
So on the GamePro article, basically it reveals that there will be over 100 minutes of energetic

01:18:01.840 --> 01:18:08.380
dance music, and it's going to have over 65 songs, and I'm assuming that the downloads

01:18:08.380 --> 01:18:13.080
will still be accessible as well. In fact, actually it does say it's compatible with

01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.880
all previous download song packs from DER and DER UltraMix 2, so that's 60 more songs

01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:22.320
right there. So that's 125 songs if you already have all these packs from the start. Here

01:18:22.320 --> 01:18:26.720
are some of the new modes you're going to have in DER UltraMix 3. Freestyle mode. And

01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:31.760
that will allow you to dance just the way you want to to any song in the game while

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:37.080
rewarding you for doing different combinations. It's like a freestyle mode. So I think that

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:40.000
just means you get to dance with no arrows but maybe I don't know if it's

01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:44.880
like a recording mode or it's rewarding you for doing certain things like I

01:18:44.880 --> 01:18:47.160
think that's that's the impression I'm getting from it is that if you do

01:18:47.160 --> 01:18:53.880
certain step combos during it you get rewarded interesting huh yeah no idea we

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.760
can't really tell from the names alone but that's pretty much all the article

01:18:56.760 --> 01:19:04.560
gives us right there so there was that and let's see um also there's gonna have

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:10.660
quest mode quest mode is basically it's like a story mode now for DDR so DDR is

01:19:10.660 --> 01:19:17.760
now getting yes tody no continue it quest mode basically now yes didn't they

01:19:17.760 --> 01:19:21.960
do this with dance dance dance yeah but how many people in this this area know

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.400
what that is I mean seriously how many people on the scene know what dance

01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:27.880
dance dance is even maybe it's a really crappy game but now it's getting this

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.000
quest mode you can travel virtually from city to city and build the ultimate

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:38.360
dance team by completing challenging songs and routines along the way. So it's basically

01:19:38.360 --> 01:19:45.360
a quest mode for DDR, like a story mode. It's Pokemon DDR! It's You Got Served The Game.

01:19:46.480 --> 01:19:53.480
Wow. That makes me sad. You know what though? It's cute, I guess. I mean, it's cute. I'm

01:19:55.100 --> 01:20:02.100
jaded though, but still. It's the 9 year old slumber party mode, basically. Yeah. But you

01:20:02.100 --> 01:20:05.220
You know what that makes me think though, if you hear about that, that means that there

01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:07.920
will have to be a lot of characters, I think.

01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:10.720
And that's one thing the Xbox games have been lacking, is that they don't have a lot of

01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:11.720
characters.

01:20:11.720 --> 01:20:16.740
Ultra Mix 1 only had two characters, Ultra Mix 2 only had four characters and two downloads,

01:20:16.740 --> 01:20:19.180
and they weren't even really downloadable characters, you just unlocked them on the

01:20:19.180 --> 01:20:20.180
disc.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:21.180
So you have what, six characters?

01:20:21.180 --> 01:20:24.100
Well, there's a whole library of dancing characters out there that haven't really been on the

01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:29.060
Xbox yet, so I'm thinking maybe putting two and two together, that's probably what freestyle,

01:20:29.060 --> 01:20:32.800
story mode is going to encompass more of those characters and I'm hoping

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:37.360
more original characters and I'm really really hoping because this is Konami of Hawaii

01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:42.280
we will finally see the DDR PC characters crossover on the console

01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:47.120
and that's right they need to travel to San Francisco in quest mode and meet

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:53.600
Betty and Mr. Spanky. Did you ever see Mr. Spanky in DDR PC?

01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.720
No, I never played DDR PC actually. Are they going to be at the local, you know,

01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:00.400
bondage club?

01:21:00.400 --> 01:21:01.900
I don't know, but...

01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:05.920
We haven't heard from Mr. Spanky in a long time. I know, we haven't. Well, who's played

01:21:05.920 --> 01:21:08.440
DDRPC lately?

01:21:08.440 --> 01:21:12.160
I have the chat room, doesn't even know what I'm talking about when I talk about Mr. Spanky.

01:21:12.160 --> 01:21:16.260
We should invite him back for a show one day. Some day, but somebody needs to find a

01:21:16.260 --> 01:21:19.080
picture of Mr. Spanky first. I hope he's still on the internet somewhere.

01:21:19.080 --> 01:21:23.240
Maybe somebody will find that and post that. I would not Google search that.

01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:26.480
Yeah, don't Google it, because you're not going to find that. You'll find other things

01:21:26.480 --> 01:21:30.280
that you don't want to see at your frail young age.

01:21:30.280 --> 01:21:33.200
Jukebox mode is another mode that's going to be in this game.

01:21:33.200 --> 01:21:34.920
Jukebox mode, this is a quote from the article,

01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:38.600
jukebox mode turns your Xbox into a music machine,

01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:42.900
allowing players to enjoy more than 65 tracks from the game.

01:21:42.900 --> 01:21:43.560
Whatever.

01:21:43.560 --> 01:21:46.200
So it kind of sounds like a throwaway mode.

01:21:46.200 --> 01:21:49.360
But well, you know, with DDR having the full screen

01:21:49.360 --> 01:21:52.760
videos and everything, maybe there

01:21:52.760 --> 01:21:54.800
will be more full screen videos in UltraMix,

01:21:54.800 --> 01:21:59.040
because there's only been like one video in each game. We had to do that thing, which

01:21:59.040 --> 01:22:04.920
was really, really homoerotic, by the way, and then Tough Enough by Vanilla Ninja and

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:09.600
Ultramix 2. So hopefully there'll be more like actual videos. Even if not, think about

01:22:09.600 --> 01:22:14.420
it. 2DX6 style had a mode like this. So, and it was well received, so maybe there'll

01:22:14.420 --> 01:22:20.440
be something like that. So we'll see. Of course there will be workout mode and of course edit

01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:23.840
mode and we're just going to assume here and assume that it still has the

01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:28.200
be able to upload your own steps because it does say you can upload content so we

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.520
are assuming that to mean that

01:22:29.520 --> 01:22:33.320
you know you get to do your own steps again as well as online tournaments and

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:35.280
Xbox Live Play. Whoop-dee-doo!

01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.440
So, any thoughts on UltraMix 3? Things that

01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.160
UltraMix 3 needs that UltraMix 2 and 1 didn't have?

01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:47.280
It needs a Pocari Sweat Dispenser. Come on, realistically.

01:22:47.280 --> 01:22:49.280
Maybe in story mode you might see it.

01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:54.280
You know...

01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:03.280
It's hard to think of new and innovative things to do with DDR in general.

01:23:04.280 --> 01:23:06.280
Except they need freaking dance magic.

01:23:07.280 --> 01:23:08.280
Yeah.

01:23:08.280 --> 01:23:14.280
I want a first person shooter minigame in this because every game should have a first person shooter aspect to it.

01:23:14.280 --> 01:23:16.280
Well maybe in quest mode there'll be a, you know...

01:23:16.280 --> 01:23:24.280
You know Konami should take a cue from Namco. You know, your loading screens you can play a little, you know, old Konami game.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:25.280
You could play Gradius.

01:23:25.280 --> 01:23:29.280
I was freaking playing the hell out of Starblade on the Tekken 5.

01:23:29.280 --> 01:23:32.280
You could totally do Pac-Man or something on that pad.

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:33.280
You know, um...

01:23:33.280 --> 01:23:35.280
But that's more midway.

01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:39.280
UltraMix has some real shit loading times too in the very beginning. It takes forever for the game to boot.

01:23:39.280 --> 01:23:44.280
And I don't know if it's because you go through like five copyright screens before you finally get to the actual game.

01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:47.920
game. Well, they're not all copyright, but you get one copyright screen, one screen that

01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.280
says Bumani, one screen that says... all this garbage that you need to be able to go through.

01:23:51.280 --> 01:23:59.160
Like, Yair Kung Fu, and, you know, Super Konami World, and Castlevania.

01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:05.600
Here's my thing, though, with UltraMix III, is that I really, really, really hope they

01:24:05.600 --> 01:24:09.640
keep up their relationship with a different drum. And I've been saying this every place

01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:13.260
I possibly can, because I really want to see this happen, because I think the different

01:24:13.260 --> 01:24:17.260
drum music that we had in Ultramix 2 was seriously like the best thing to happen

01:24:17.260 --> 01:24:22.460
to DDR since DDR I don't know it was the best so I really hope they are gonna

01:24:22.460 --> 01:24:25.380
continue that relationship with a different drum or at least even if not

01:24:25.380 --> 01:24:30.860
that label specifically that whole idea of finding independent musicians who

01:24:30.860 --> 01:24:35.980
make just as damn good music as anybody else and put it in the game to make big

01:24:35.980 --> 01:24:45.460
honestly you know honestly I just forgot I was gonna say okay I was sort of just

01:24:45.460 --> 01:24:55.260
it's trying to wrap my mind around a whole I guess RPG mode in a DDR game I

01:24:55.260 --> 01:24:59.100
still have flashbacks to dance dance dance and that game was horrible you

01:24:59.100 --> 01:25:01.500
know what I'll be very curious to see I don't know how much of this they're

01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:05.180
gonna show at e3 now you know last year Ultramix 2 we barely had anything at e3

01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:09.700
In fact, a lot of people trashed Ultramix 2 saying, even I was looking at Ultramix 2

01:25:09.700 --> 01:25:15.540
last year going, this is going to suck, and now I believe Ultramix 2 is the best home

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:19.520
release we've had on any system, period.

01:25:19.520 --> 01:25:23.680
And it kind of stank at E3 last year, so it's going to be interesting to see exactly how

01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:26.260
much we get to see this year at E3.

01:25:26.260 --> 01:25:27.260
I don't know.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.260
We'll see.

01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.920
And also, you know, another good thing that Ultramix has been pretty good on is providing

01:25:30.920 --> 01:25:35.120
us with new, like, 10s for those folks that like the challenge and just, you know, and

01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:38.640
I'm looking at you, Tody, the people that just can't enjoy DDR without there being 10-footers

01:25:38.640 --> 01:25:39.640
in it.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:42.840
Well, it's not that I can't enjoy it, it's the fact that you'll come out with some new

01:25:42.840 --> 01:25:45.400
song and you'll make it a 7-footer.

01:25:45.400 --> 01:25:51.360
I mean, during, I was with Loki when we were testing out DDR Extreme US, and I think it

01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:57.040
was, and I think I triple-A'd, like, half of the new songs on the first try with the

01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:00.180
bigger timing windows, and I'm like, okay, now what?

01:26:00.180 --> 01:26:03.260
you know what what am i going to do with it

01:26:03.260 --> 01:26:05.960
but you have to add a challenge difficulty or something i mean you have

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:10.780
four difficulties to work with you can make one of those difficult to suit

01:26:10.780 --> 01:26:14.880
everybody you know i think you have to remember though toady on the bell of

01:26:14.880 --> 01:26:18.340
players that these games are made to it you could imagine is on a graph that

01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:20.340
looks like an upside down bell curve

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:24.800
you are way on the bottom over here you are one of the few that they need to

01:26:24.800 --> 01:26:26.000
cater to so

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:29.480
just make a challenge difficulty

01:26:29.480 --> 01:26:31.520
I'll design the damn steps myself.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.800
I mean, come on, there's more than enough people that would

01:26:33.800 --> 01:26:35.920
be willing to do it, you know?

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.560
Four difficulties or whatever.

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.400
Make one hard one.

01:26:40.400 --> 01:26:41.320
We'll see, we'll see.

01:26:41.320 --> 01:26:43.440
Anyway, so we will see what happens with Quest Mode a

01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:44.120
little later on.

01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:46.160
And of course, as we get more details, we'll post it to our

01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.840
website, orangelandre.com.

01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:49.160
DDR Freak as well.

01:26:49.160 --> 01:26:51.280
They've got lots and lots of news on this stuff.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:53.720
And all the other sites out there, I'm sure, reporting on

01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.480
this as well.

01:26:54.480 --> 01:26:56.560
Speaking of DDR Freak, I want to mention this at some point

01:26:56.560 --> 01:26:57.280
during the show.

01:26:57.280 --> 01:27:01.960
Friday nights on DDR Freak Radio are actually replays of this show, so to those of you guys

01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:05.240
that are actually hearing this the first time on Friday night, DDR Freak, hello, and thanks

for listening. So check that out over on The Freak, as we so lovingly call it here on this

01:27:09.820 --> 01:27:17.100
show. Anything else on UltraMix you guys want to add in? Okay. We're going to talk about

01:27:17.100 --> 01:27:20.260
Extreme 2, but first we're going to have ourselves a little bit of a cage match. We got to get

01:27:20.260 --> 01:27:23.540
to that at some point tonight. Can you believe how fast this show is going by tonight? This

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:26.540
This is what happens when you actually have news to talk about.

01:27:26.540 --> 01:27:27.540
It's crazy.

01:27:27.540 --> 01:27:33.540
Alright, let's get into tonight's Cage Match, shall we?

01:27:33.540 --> 01:27:38.540
Last week in the Orange Lounge Cage Match,

01:27:38.540 --> 01:27:42.540
we had a song that featured Paula Terry on vocals actually winning this.

01:27:42.540 --> 01:27:45.540
Look, you're gonna have to remind me, what the hell was the name of this song

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.540
and who did this and all that good stuff?

01:27:47.540 --> 01:27:48.540
Do you remember?

01:27:48.540 --> 01:27:56.300
It was in Midnight Tune 2 or something like that, and some arcade racing game, and it

01:27:56.300 --> 01:28:04.240
was Nothing Lives Forever starring Paul Osterre, and it was a guy that did the music from Act

01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.240
Razor.

01:28:05.240 --> 01:28:06.240
Alright, sounds good.

01:28:06.240 --> 01:28:10.480
Okay, so we're going to play a clip from this one because it was last week's winner, and

I'm here today to conquer the world

01:29:19.700 --> 01:29:29.700
Can't catch up

01:29:29.700 --> 01:29:39.700
I don't mind if I'm not the only one for you

01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:49.700
The time must come to say goodbye

01:29:53.700 --> 01:30:03.700
Because nothing can keep forever

01:30:03.700 --> 01:30:09.700
But I keep going back to you

01:31:03.700 --> 01:31:28.460
Alright, that was a clip there of song number one, that was Polteri, Nothing Lives Forever.

01:31:28.460 --> 01:31:33.540
alright song number two is my song tonight and you know lately I've been

01:31:33.540 --> 01:31:38.660
kind of downloading these random British trance and dance compilations I'm just

01:31:38.660 --> 01:31:43.580
like I just want more dance music gimme gimme gimme so I found this one and I

01:31:43.580 --> 01:31:48.620
kind of like this one it's it's a little bit poppy but I just like it so I'm

01:31:48.620 --> 01:31:51.120
putting it in the cage match because I think you guys will like it too and I

01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:56.180
think this is like total DDR songs so we'll see this artist is named diamond

01:31:56.180 --> 01:32:01.180
Somebody I've never heard of, but this is the artist Diamond, and the song is Reason. Enjoy you guys.

01:32:17.180 --> 01:32:22.180
Something in your eyes I know I can't resist

01:32:22.180 --> 01:32:36.180
Something in the air, I don't know why You were hardly there when I was on my own

01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:42.180
There's something about you that makes me cry

01:32:42.180 --> 01:32:50.180
Can I believe that your heart still beats for me?

01:32:50.180 --> 01:32:57.180
Let me receive a sign that you're my destiny

01:32:57.180 --> 01:33:02.180
I wanna know, give me a reason for me to believe in

01:33:02.180 --> 01:33:05.180
Can't you see it in my eyes?

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:09.180
That I need a reason before I'm still breathing

01:33:09.180 --> 01:33:12.180
Is it time to say goodbye?

01:33:12.180 --> 01:33:14.180
Cause deep in my heart I know

01:33:14.180 --> 01:33:17.180
There's a reason why I am not leaving

01:33:17.180 --> 01:33:19.180
Why I'm not alone

01:33:19.180 --> 01:33:22.180
So give me a reason for me to believe it

01:33:22.180 --> 01:33:26.180
Give me a reason

01:33:26.180 --> 01:33:52.100
Something in your eyes still takes my breath away

01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:59.100
Something's deep inside, please tell me why

01:33:59.100 --> 01:34:06.100
I don't know what I should do to break this spell

01:34:06.100 --> 01:34:12.100
How can you make my life an alibi

01:34:12.100 --> 01:34:15.100
Can I believe

01:34:15.100 --> 01:34:19.100
That your heart still beats for me

01:34:19.100 --> 01:34:22.100
Let me receive

01:34:22.100 --> 01:34:26.100
A sign that you're my destiny

01:34:26.100 --> 01:34:28.100
I wanna know

01:34:28.100 --> 01:34:31.100

Can't you see it in my eyes

That I need a reason for I'm so breathing

01:34:38.100 --> 01:34:41.100
It's time to say goodbye

01:34:41.100 --> 01:34:43.100
Cause deep in my heart I know

01:34:43.100 --> 01:34:46.100
There's a reason why I'm not leaving

01:34:46.100 --> 01:34:48.100
Why I'm not alone

01:34:48.100 --> 01:34:51.600
So give me a reason for me to believe it

01:34:51.600 --> 01:34:53.600
Give me a reason

01:34:53.600 --> 01:34:55.100
Give me a reason

01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:58.600
Give me a reason for me to believe it

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:01.600
Can't you see it in my eyes

01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:05.600
That I need a reason for I'm not breathing

01:35:05.600 --> 01:35:08.600
Is it time to say goodbye

01:35:08.600 --> 01:35:10.600
Cause deep in my heart I know

01:35:10.600 --> 01:35:13.600
There's a reason why I'm not leaving

01:35:13.600 --> 01:35:15.600
Why I'm not alone

01:35:15.600 --> 01:35:22.600
So gimme a reason for me to believe it Gimme a reason, gimme a reason

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:50.600
It's all generic, so it gets a five and a half.

01:35:50.600 --> 01:35:52.600
Five and a half! Loki!

01:35:52.600 --> 01:35:59.600
It was okay. The bass line reminded me of something from Rimmel or Run,

01:35:59.600 --> 01:36:04.600
but then it sounded like some other song I heard of, so I don't know.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:09.600
It's just kind of, it's not bad, it just sounds familiar.

01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:14.600
And then, so I give it a seven, and then I give the porn on my PSP a ten.

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:16.600
Which you were putting on cam during that song.

01:36:16.600 --> 01:36:17.600
Yes I did.

01:36:17.600 --> 01:36:20.600
You know what I think the familiarity is? Somebody pointed this out in the chat room.

01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:23.600
Who said this? Because I totally agree with what they said.

01:36:23.600 --> 01:36:25.600
I apologize to who said this because I can't.

01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:28.600
Oh, Fireboma said, it has a very Lasko feeling to it.

01:36:28.600 --> 01:36:29.600
Oh no, Zaku said it first.

01:36:29.600 --> 01:36:32.600
Legend Zaku said it has a very Lasko sound to it.

01:36:32.600 --> 01:36:34.600
I kind of agree. It sounds like them.

01:36:34.600 --> 01:36:38.600
Which is interesting because Lasko actually had a song on this exact same CD,

01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:41.600
but it sounded like totally unlike them, so go figure.

01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:52.600
Anyway, I like it. It's poppy. I think somebody said they could sing along to it. I feel the same way. It's a drive in my car and sing and feel happy and pretty. So I give it an 8.

01:36:52.600 --> 01:36:58.600
I was in the bathroom and I missed about half the song.

01:36:58.600 --> 01:37:04.600
It sounded pretty generic to me. Like I said, I only caught the last third of it or so.

01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:13.600
It didn't strike me as anything particularly outstanding. I'll give it a six.

01:37:13.600 --> 01:37:15.600
Alrighty, Bud!

01:37:15.600 --> 01:37:19.600
I was in the kitchen and it sounded like standard pop.

01:37:19.600 --> 01:37:25.440
pop. And yeah, nothing terribly exciting. Six. It's definitely a drive in the car, sing

01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:31.440
along, be gay, all that. Yeah, yeah, thanks. Yeah, I do that too. You be gay? Alright.

01:37:31.440 --> 01:37:37.800
Gay isn't happy. Yes, exactly. Alright, alright. Anyway, let's move on. There is one more song

01:37:37.800 --> 01:37:41.320
you guys get to vote for tonight. Here it is. It's Jamie's pick. Jamie, what did you

01:37:41.320 --> 01:37:46.960
pick for us tonight? I'm sure people heard this on my Tuesday show, Plug Plug. But this

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:54.960
This is a song off of the CD called Demograzie, which was by Damon Auburn of Blurr, also the guy behind Gorillaz.

01:37:54.960 --> 01:37:56.960
Big surprise, huh?

01:37:56.960 --> 01:38:01.960
But this is a remix of a song off of that album called A Rappy Song. It's really out there.

01:38:01.960 --> 01:38:04.960
You know, the title alone makes me think of PSO.

01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:06.960
All Rappies?

01:38:06.960 --> 01:38:09.960
Am I just a nerd because I think of Rag Rappies?

01:38:09.960 --> 01:38:11.960
Keep in mind I haven't heard the song yet.

01:38:11.960 --> 01:38:13.960
How's this for nerdy?

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:23.480
There is an item called an Alrappy that you can use to boost your stats and the developers

01:38:23.480 --> 01:38:25.560
were using it for game testing.

01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:28.280
And I've got some.

01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:31.400
I cheated PSO and I'm proud of it.

01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:38.400
Song number three tonight, Damon Albren with A Rappy Song, the remix. Enjoy.

01:39:01.400 --> 01:39:15.080
I'm drinking all the sunshine in the tea I'm taking my faith in my faith

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:23.080
And all my words will be shot up in your face It's a waste of fuel, I'm giving you a pen

01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:25.080
I'm dying

01:39:25.080 --> 01:39:27.080
Oh

01:39:27.080 --> 01:39:29.080
Ooh

01:39:29.080 --> 01:39:31.080
Ooh

01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:33.080
Ooh

01:39:33.080 --> 01:39:35.080
Ooh

01:39:35.080 --> 01:39:37.080
Oh

01:39:37.080 --> 01:39:39.080
Ooh

01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.080
Ooh

01:39:41.080 --> 01:39:43.080
Ooh

01:39:43.080 --> 01:39:45.080
I

01:39:45.080 --> 01:39:47.080
I

01:39:47.080 --> 01:39:49.080
I

01:39:49.080 --> 01:39:51.080
I

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.880
No matter the feeling that your money can't buy

01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:55.280
Becoming a slave to the rhythm

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.680
There's no way that you could stop me now

01:39:56.680 --> 01:39:58.680
I'd like to see you try

01:39:58.680 --> 01:40:00.080
Cause I'm already long gone

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.280
Don't be scared for me baby

01:40:01.280 --> 01:40:03.280
Let's throw me a chance to cry

01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.080
I can't believe you have to stay behind me

01:40:05.080 --> 01:40:06.680
Throw me your ass off with me baby

01:40:06.680 --> 01:40:08.280
Tell me why

01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.480
So lie your teeth on the cherry

01:40:09.480 --> 01:40:10.480
Don't follow me

01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.080
Throw me your feet to the side

01:40:13.080 --> 01:40:14.680
But best believe I'm a-breathing

01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:17.880
Break ground before I lie

01:40:17.880 --> 01:40:19.280
I know I'll never let live

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:21.280
But I know I won't let you die

01:40:21.280 --> 01:40:24.280
So go from Malta to the country

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.280
To the club and sing my song

01:40:26.280 --> 01:40:29.280
And hopefully, I'll look at Chad and

01:40:30.280 --> 01:40:33.280
She was friendly, but my camera's thin

01:40:33.280 --> 01:40:35.280
That's the reason I wasn't in

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:38.280
My story when we come again

01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:41.280
I hope you like that

01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.280
And the white skin and the white hair

01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:45.280
Like the lads who snitch when they style their hair

01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:48.280
I like that crimp look, what they do with their bangs

01:40:48.280 --> 01:40:52.280
But I feel like a faggot who's got two feet to chase those thighs

01:40:52.280 --> 01:40:55.280
I'm gonna get up on the side of motherfuckin' fries

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.280
I'm gonna get engraving, if you wanna lay me

01:40:57.280 --> 01:41:00.280
They make you can't stay awake even if you're crazy

01:41:27.280 --> 01:41:56.720
Song number three.

01:41:56.720 --> 01:42:02.400
Damon Albrun with a rappy song the remix. Did you think it was rappy or crappy?

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:07.440
Dark Sakura. I'm just really pissed off at the people who are being fucking rude about all of these songs.

01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:13.880
So I'm giving it... Don't let them ruffle your feathers. No, the thing is that I see this week

01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:15.560
after week and this is bullshit.

01:42:15.560 --> 01:42:19.880
You know, we are doing this show for you people and the least you can do is be nice, okay?

01:42:19.880 --> 01:42:24.160
So I give the chat room a negative 50 and I give my song a 10.

01:42:24.160 --> 01:42:32.160
Alright, Loki. I didn't care for this song. Not at all. It's a four.

01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:44.160
I thought it was kind of quirky. I don't know. It had a nice groove to it, though. I can't say I didn't like it, because I thought it was kind of groovy and it made me bounce, so that's worth something, so I give it a seven.

01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:49.080
Cody yeah I gotta agree with that I mean it was pretty damn weird but I noticed I

01:42:49.080 --> 01:42:54.760
was sitting there like you know bouncing and you know yeah it's quirky yeah it

01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:57.520
was it was something I think I could listen to I'd give it an eight I like

01:42:57.520 --> 01:43:04.880
that one alrighty but give it a seven it was definitely something you can pop

01:43:04.880 --> 01:43:10.400
along to all right all right that being said let's recap the three songs you can

01:43:10.400 --> 01:43:13.520

Yes.

01:43:19.560 --> 01:43:20.280
OK, thank you.

01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:23.920
Where's my clip?

01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.440

01:44:22.220 --> 01:44:25.340
they will help you out because they're nice all right this is the part of the

01:44:25.340 --> 01:44:28.580
show where I usually ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene so Loki what's

01:44:28.580 --> 01:44:33.740
going on in the sim scene as far as I'm aware nothing and I am double-checking

01:44:33.740 --> 01:44:38.060
to make sure you know that that's not the case I would hope that there's

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:47.660
something going on anyways no really um I don't think there is anything going on

01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:52.600
as far as releases go because I was checking the other day for some brand

01:44:52.600 --> 01:44:57.980
new you know the food mix stuff see if there's any you know new stuff for that

01:44:57.980 --> 01:45:05.840
but um no no there there wasn't so but like I said I'm double checking right

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:13.340
now. I should have done this earlier. Shame on you! Whatever, you know, honestly, it doesn't

01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:23.180
matter. But anyways, let's see here. You might check out DDRUK since they're still coming

01:45:23.180 --> 01:45:37.060
about and I'm sure they're working on still the brand new Sim Files 4. I think they're

01:45:37.060 --> 01:45:42.500
finishing up Ultramix 2 or something. They're the song packs for Ultramix 2, last time I

01:45:42.500 --> 01:45:49.980
checked. But really other than that, you're not going to find much new stuff out there

01:45:49.980 --> 01:45:54.980
because there really isn't that much new stuff coming around.

01:45:54.980 --> 01:45:58.100
Let's see if there's any developments in the food mix thing here.

01:45:58.100 --> 01:46:01.180
I wish. Food mix 2 needs to come out.

01:46:01.180 --> 01:46:05.300
It needs to come out now so we can like... Are they actually doing a food mix 2?

01:46:05.300 --> 01:46:08.260
Yep, remember? Oh, hot.

01:46:08.260 --> 01:46:10.520
I reported that a while ago.

01:46:10.520 --> 01:46:14.840
No, anyways, I forgot. Okay, kill me.

01:46:14.840 --> 01:46:18.980
No, here's what's going on. Looks like DDR C&C style

01:46:18.980 --> 01:46:21.820
uh... selection from beat mario

01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.660
uh...

01:46:23.660 --> 01:46:28.340
it was up their web pages updated whatever that's supposed to mean

01:46:28.340 --> 01:46:32.700
i don't know doesn't say anything so guess what folks that means nothing's

01:46:32.700 --> 01:46:34.460
going on nada

01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:39.140
to some more shitty simp files online

01:46:39.140 --> 01:46:42.540
but hey you can't believe of myself that's all of you know how many max

01:46:42.540 --> 01:46:45.220
remixes posted in the last day

01:46:45.220 --> 01:46:47.640
let's find out shall we

01:46:47.640 --> 01:46:54.760
Now honestly, I haven't seen that many max remixes lately.

01:46:54.760 --> 01:46:57.120
I actually haven't seen any max remixes lately.

01:46:57.120 --> 01:47:03.160
I think they may be just not even trying to make them with

01:47:03.160 --> 01:47:04.480
any structure whatsoever.

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:07.880
The ones I've seen have been like these stupid bots files.

01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:10.200
And those are really crappy.

01:47:10.200 --> 01:47:13.320
But just for shits and giggles, let's see how many max

01:47:13.320 --> 01:47:17.360
remixes there are since the last time we broadcast.

01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:19.600
I vote 20.

01:47:19.600 --> 01:47:21.600
You think 20?

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:23.420
Okay.

01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:27.240
And the winner is...

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:28.880
uh...

01:47:28.880 --> 01:47:31.640
well, let's see here.

01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:36.640
Since last time we have done the show, there have been one, two, three, four, five, six,

01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.080
seven, eight, nine maxsim files. Now,

01:47:40.080 --> 01:47:43.720
granted...

01:47:43.720 --> 01:47:46.500
Okay, okay, here's a list here. We've got

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:50.580
Maximizer, which I assume is just some fun steps to the Maximizers.

01:47:50.580 --> 01:47:55.580
Um, StaryonSurvivormax. StaryonSurvivormax!

01:47:55.580 --> 01:47:58.380
StaryonSurvivormax. Die! Um,

01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:01.940
RizlaMaxDeepDynamiteSomethingRoder, something along

01:48:01.940 --> 01:48:06.700
the sim file that was a joke. MaxAttack version 2, Trip Machine Climax,

01:48:06.700 --> 01:48:12.820
easy edit. MaxPeriod, another edit. Max420LLDJOB

01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:22.820
V-I-S-D-J-Vichese, Eat Your Heart Assum, Joke File, and Max Unlimited, Edit, and Max Wipeout version 2.

01:48:23.820 --> 01:48:28.820
Honestly, folks, none of this stuff's worth downloading. Just save your time.

01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:31.820
Do something more constructive, like download porn. Seriously.

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:35.820
Honestly, there's a lot more porn out there than, you know, SIM files.

01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:40.820
And you know what? With porn, you can never get bad porn, so that's good to know.

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:49.320
Alright, anything else? I say, you know, make porn, not, you know, bad max symphiles.

01:48:49.320 --> 01:48:52.320
That's what, actually, no, I don't want to see anyone making porn.

01:48:52.320 --> 01:48:54.820
Yeah, please don't, don't make your own porn. Don't, don't.

01:48:54.820 --> 01:48:57.820
Especially considering most of you are under 18. Don't do that!

01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:59.320
That would be illegal.

01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:02.320
Alright, we are going to open up the Skype line in a little bit, guys.

01:49:02.320 --> 01:49:06.320
I want to start talking about Xtreme 2 a little bit, though, but if you do want to get in on the Skype line,

01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:12.320
Let me tell you this, I know that tons of people want to get in tonight, so be ready.

01:49:12.320 --> 01:49:19.320
I've actually got emails of people that want to get in, or wanting me to open it up special for them, so you're going to have to go against them.

01:49:19.320 --> 01:49:24.320
www.orangelandsradio.com, click on interact with us and get your program ready.

01:49:24.320 --> 01:49:28.480
Anyway, I want to talk about Xtreme 2 real quick.

01:49:28.480 --> 01:49:37.480
Now, the person that found DDR UltraMix 3 was this person, Tep, over on DDRFreak.

01:49:37.480 --> 01:49:44.240
And then after Tep found out about the UltraMix 3, one of the admins over there, Cutris, actually

01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.880
went over and started kind of, I guess, scouring GamePro's site a little bit and found out

01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:52.560
that GamePro also spilled the beans on Xtreme 2.

01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:58.600
Oops, they did it again and I say that for a reason because one of the big shockers in

01:49:58.600 --> 01:50:04.120
this article is that Dance Dance Revolution Extreme 2 will have Genie in a Bottle and

01:50:04.120 --> 01:50:10.640
Oops I Did It Again as confirmed songs.

01:50:10.640 --> 01:50:15.540
Now I know this thrills Dark Sakura to no end here considering how she feels about that

01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:16.540
type of music.

01:50:16.540 --> 01:50:17.960
It's not Jenny in a Bottle?

01:50:17.960 --> 01:50:18.960
It's not Jenny in a Bottle.

01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:25.960
How about shit in a bag? Set that on fire.

01:50:25.960 --> 01:50:29.840
Alright, so that was one big revolution, uh, revolution, revelation made.

01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:34.200
Uh, again, they're saying over a hundred minutes of dance music gonna be in there,

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.580
and they're saying, this is what GamePro is saying, now keep in mind that I believe it was

01:50:37.580 --> 01:50:40.640
them or somebody said this last year and it didn't really happen, but they are

01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:41.560
saying

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.200
PlayStation 2 owners,

01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:47.680
excuse me, will be able to go head-to-head with a new online feature.

01:50:47.680 --> 01:50:50.020
So the online thing...

01:50:50.020 --> 01:50:53.020
Excuse me, I'm choking over here. The online thing doing so well in Extreme...

01:50:53.020 --> 01:50:54.320
I'm sorry, Ultramix 2,

01:50:54.320 --> 01:50:57.620
that now it's going to be a part of Extreme 2 as well.

01:50:57.620 --> 01:51:00.520
So, very interesting, I think.

01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:04.240
And as if you didn't know enough stupid people on Xbox Live, now you get to

01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:07.900
meet them on PlayStation 2, which opens up a whole new world of stupid people.

01:51:07.900 --> 01:51:09.180
Um...

01:51:09.180 --> 01:51:13.000
And then that's about it, although we do know that iToy Support is coming back,

01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:14.720
and as well...

01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.920
Yeah, itoy support's coming back, and let's see.

01:51:17.920 --> 01:51:20.800
Workout mode is coming as well, and you get to do your

01:51:20.800 --> 01:51:23.800
own steps in edit mode, of course, as well.

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:25.000
So that's about it.

01:51:25.000 --> 01:51:27.640
The online mode being the biggest thing about that, as

01:51:27.640 --> 01:51:30.760
well as the genie in a bottle, and oops, I did it again.

01:51:30.760 --> 01:51:34.200
So this goes back to what I said earlier.

01:51:34.200 --> 01:51:35.960
Remember I said I'd mention this again.

01:51:35.960 --> 01:51:39.320
Remember, boys and girls, DDR Extreme is not made for you.

01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:41.960
It's made partially for you, and you'll get

01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:42.680
something out of it.

01:51:42.680 --> 01:51:44.560
You'll get your Sakura, I'm sure.

01:51:44.560 --> 01:51:47.660
I don't know anything for sure, but I think it's a given that Sakura will probably show

01:51:47.660 --> 01:51:49.120
up in this one.

01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:52.280
But now, for the Slumber Party girls, they're going to have Genie in a Bottle and oops,

01:51:52.280 --> 01:51:53.280
I did it again.

01:51:53.280 --> 01:51:54.280
Deal.

01:51:54.280 --> 01:51:57.200
And you also have to remember that none of these girls usually, I shouldn't say none,

01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:01.680
a very small percentage of these nine-year-old Slumber Party girls are going to play on heavy,

01:52:01.680 --> 01:52:07.400
but Konami's going to give them seven footsteps with, you know, 200 steps on heavy anyway,

01:52:07.400 --> 01:52:08.400
so.

01:52:08.400 --> 01:52:11.200
Wouldn't it be comedy gold, though, if they made Genie in a Bottle like a ten-footer?

01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:15.560
i would actually probably by the game

01:52:15.560 --> 01:52:18.120
just as a joke

01:52:18.120 --> 01:52:21.240
but you know it but this is interesting if it's online and people can create

01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:23.940
their own steps you know there's gonna be ten footsteps out there to oops i

01:52:23.940 --> 01:52:25.560
didn't get that they'll be crap

01:52:25.560 --> 01:52:28.240
it'll be like finger finger revolution separately

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:32.520
oops to the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the the

01:52:32.520 --> 01:52:36.600
was made no sex just a big string of sixteenth note they go into a random

01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:40.860
no sensical order whatsoever much like many in the group twelve footers

01:52:40.860 --> 01:52:45.860
Or they'll just go in and add triplets which don't go to anything.

01:52:45.860 --> 01:52:50.860
So, very interesting.

01:52:50.860 --> 01:52:53.860
It was actually EGM, thank you for the tip there.

01:52:53.860 --> 01:52:57.860
EGM was actually the one that said that online play would be included last year and they were wrong.

01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:59.860
But now GamePro is saying it this year.

01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:04.860
And hopefully, I don't know, do you think online play is a good thing for DDR?

01:53:04.860 --> 01:53:06.860
I think it's a bad thing.

01:53:06.860 --> 01:53:11.860
Are you asking me that specifically? Or are you asking the chat room?

01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:16.860
I guess anybody in the room that wants to answer that. We'll do the Skype line thing later for those who want to ask.

01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:24.860
Well, unless they, well, it's pretty much impossible for them to tell who's using a controller and who's using a pad.

01:53:24.860 --> 01:53:27.860
I mean, it's really not worth my time to try and put forth a bunch of...

01:53:27.860 --> 01:53:29.860
Well, now Xbox Live will tell you who's using a controller.

01:53:29.860 --> 01:53:30.860
Really?

01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:34.940
I thought, I was actually under the impression that they had some sort of system that allowed

01:53:34.940 --> 01:53:37.300
them to bypass that.

01:53:37.300 --> 01:53:40.780
I think, everybody will hack anything.

01:53:40.780 --> 01:53:42.260
But it's really the minority.

01:53:42.260 --> 01:53:44.380
I don't think I've run into any of those people.

01:53:44.380 --> 01:53:45.380
Everything I have is legit.

01:53:45.380 --> 01:53:49.340
The only problem is that some pads, the home built ones, I think Cobalt Fluxes will show

01:53:49.340 --> 01:53:50.340
up as controllers.

01:53:50.340 --> 01:53:51.340
Really?

01:53:51.340 --> 01:53:54.260
So unfortunately some people that do really bad, they're like, I swear I'm on a pad, I

01:53:54.260 --> 01:53:55.260
swear I'm on a pad.

01:53:55.260 --> 01:53:56.260
Yeah.

01:53:56.260 --> 01:54:00.420
So, I'm hoping that that feature will carry over into PlayStation 2.

01:54:00.420 --> 01:54:05.340
somebody will hack it, it's a given, but you know, for 99% of players it's not gonna matter.

01:54:05.340 --> 01:54:08.620
Yeah, I mean, I guess for the people that can't get out to an arcade it's great. I mean,

01:54:08.620 --> 01:54:12.660
for me, I would never use it. I'd just rather go to my local arcade or whatever and play

01:54:12.660 --> 01:54:14.620
people. But this is interesting because this is kind

01:54:14.620 --> 01:54:17.780
of ties into what you were talking about in the last show, Loki, is you were talking about

01:54:17.780 --> 01:54:22.080
this is where DDR is going, is that because the arcades are dying and nobody seems to

01:54:22.080 --> 01:54:27.740
care anymore, online mode is where it's going to. So does this news surprise you at all,

01:54:27.740 --> 01:54:29.180
Okay, I'm kind of curious.

01:54:29.180 --> 01:54:33.500
No, but then again, they need more things that be on their network adapter.

01:54:33.500 --> 01:54:37.660
After all, they don't want to be like the GameCube.

01:54:37.660 --> 01:54:40.860
Well, now who knows? There might be some big thing that comes down with DDR with

01:54:40.860 --> 01:54:44.140
Mario, which is the one game we didn't get any news on this week.

01:54:44.140 --> 01:54:45.420
Very soon, though.

01:54:45.420 --> 01:54:49.140
Think about it, guys. We're only a week and a half away. Honestly, folks, do you really

01:54:49.140 --> 01:54:52.200
think you're going to get online play with anything

01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.900
on the GameCube? No.

01:54:53.900 --> 01:54:55.700
You'll get LAN play.

01:54:55.700 --> 01:54:58.260
hello and play

01:54:58.260 --> 01:55:00.580
enjoying the maybe maybe

01:55:00.580 --> 01:55:04.500
yeah i i would expect it on my play the arm are you'll be very weird because

01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:07.740
the yard mario city kids on how to use the internet the hell we're talking

01:55:07.740 --> 01:55:10.260
about

01:55:10.260 --> 01:55:12.340
all right honestly

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:14.180
damn mario fucking a

01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:18.620
by the plumb something i mean i was the he's been doing a lot of like mackin on

01:55:18.620 --> 01:55:19.620
princesses

01:55:19.620 --> 01:55:25.140
and like smashing turtles but i haven't actually seen you know unclog a toilet

01:55:25.140 --> 01:55:27.620
Oh, he just unclogs the princess all the time.

01:55:27.620 --> 01:55:31.620
No, they unclog the pipes of all of those monsters in Mario Brothers.

01:55:31.620 --> 01:55:32.620
He cleans her pipes.

01:55:32.620 --> 01:55:33.620
He cleans her pipes.

01:55:33.620 --> 01:55:34.620
Waxes.

01:55:34.620 --> 01:55:35.620
With his plunger.

01:55:35.620 --> 01:55:36.620
God.

01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:42.620
We've sunk that low.

01:55:42.620 --> 01:55:43.620
Yes, we have.

01:55:43.620 --> 01:55:44.620
All right.

01:55:44.620 --> 01:55:47.620
I think that's a sign that we probably should reveal the cage match winner.

01:55:47.620 --> 01:55:49.660
Are you guys ready to hear about the cage match winner tonight?

01:55:49.660 --> 01:55:50.660
I don't care.

01:55:50.660 --> 01:55:51.660
Why not?

01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:53.940
Tons of people voted in tonight's cage match.

01:55:53.940 --> 01:55:56.780
I think this is one of the largest turnouts we've had in a while.

01:55:56.780 --> 01:56:00.420
And the winning song won by only two votes, if you can believe that.

01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:03.420
You want to hear the song that won?

01:56:03.420 --> 01:56:04.420
We'll see.

01:56:04.420 --> 01:56:09.260
Damon Albrin with the rapping song.

01:56:09.260 --> 01:56:12.900
No, I'm really fucking surprised.

01:56:12.900 --> 01:56:13.900
You know what?

01:56:13.900 --> 01:56:17.420
I think what happened, because the other songs had the exact same number of votes, I think

01:56:17.420 --> 01:56:21.620
the trance vote got split and it allowed the quirk thing to go through.

01:56:21.620 --> 01:56:26.340
Either that, or after you spanked everybody in the chat room, they voted for you out of

01:56:26.340 --> 01:56:27.340
fear.

01:56:27.340 --> 01:56:32.340
No, seriously, all I wanted was for people just to be a little bit more open.

01:56:32.340 --> 01:56:33.460
And it wasn't just for me.

01:56:33.460 --> 01:56:35.860
They were bitching about everything that went through.

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:38.800
So I was like, stop bitching, just listen.

01:56:38.800 --> 01:56:40.500
You know what?

01:56:40.500 --> 01:56:41.500
People will bitch about everything.

01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:42.500
It's what the internet's for.

01:56:42.500 --> 01:56:43.500
You know what?

01:56:43.500 --> 01:56:46.780
As an internet celebrity, you're going to have to deal with this.

01:56:46.780 --> 01:56:48.500
I know.

01:56:48.500 --> 01:56:51.580
There's going to be paparazzi out there that are going to photograph you when you're

01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:57.640
Only celebrity, I have to throw a temper tantrum every so often so they can be on the cover

01:56:57.640 --> 01:57:03.080
of the star and then I can sue them for money for something.

01:57:03.080 --> 01:57:04.080
You know what we need?

01:57:04.080 --> 01:57:09.860
We need like an internet version of the star and we should be in it, but it has to be a

01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:10.860
flattering story.

01:57:10.860 --> 01:57:14.500
We can't have any, you know, no fat pictures of me or nude sunbathing or anything like

01:57:14.500 --> 01:57:15.500
that.

01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:19.140
How about we make a website called fakenews.com?

01:57:19.140 --> 01:57:20.620
They probably already have it.

01:57:20.620 --> 01:57:21.620
That's why we're not going to make it.

01:57:21.620 --> 01:57:22.620
Alright, let me check.

01:57:22.620 --> 01:57:23.620
I got a picture.

01:57:23.620 --> 01:57:25.620
Hey, moviepoopshoot.com is still around.

01:57:25.620 --> 01:57:27.620
Oh my God.

01:57:27.620 --> 01:57:31.980
Alright, we're going to go to a break, and when we come back from this break, it's your

01:57:31.980 --> 01:57:36.740
show boys and girls, and I always fear this part of the show when I let it be their show.

01:57:36.740 --> 01:57:37.740
Ha!

01:57:37.740 --> 01:57:39.300
There is no fakenews.com.

01:57:39.300 --> 01:57:40.540
We will make it happen.

01:57:40.540 --> 01:57:42.740
Now somebody's going to get to it before you.

01:57:42.740 --> 01:57:43.740
We'll see.

01:57:43.740 --> 01:57:44.740
Alright, anyway.

01:57:44.740 --> 01:57:45.740
Anyway, guys.

01:57:45.740 --> 01:57:46.740
We're going to go to a break.

01:57:46.740 --> 01:57:49.080
When we come back, it's your show because we are going to open up the Skype line right

01:57:49.080 --> 01:57:50.080
after this.

01:57:50.080 --> 01:57:53.680
this break though you get music from I figure since we've done a lot of home

01:57:53.680 --> 01:57:57.920
stuff tonight we're gonna do Ultramix 2 in this break so enjoy this selection

01:57:57.920 --> 01:57:59.920
music from Ultramix 2 and we'll be back after this.

01:58:27.920 --> 01:58:31.560
But you gotta tell me, what you wanna do

01:58:31.560 --> 01:58:36.760
I'm in heaven with you

01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:44.760
I'm in heaven with you

01:58:46.760 --> 01:58:51.760
I'm in heaven with you

01:59:21.760 --> 01:59:26.760
You're the one you want from me

01:59:26.760 --> 01:59:29.760
You never knew

01:59:29.760 --> 01:59:31.760
Only wants one thing

02:01:29.760 --> 02:01:54.720
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

02:01:54.720 --> 02:02:22.720
Let me tell you somethin' you don't know Let me tell you somethin' you don't know

02:02:22.720 --> 02:02:28.940
let me tell you something you don't know

02:02:28.940 --> 02:02:36.980
let me tell you something you don't know

02:02:36.980 --> 02:02:44.240
take you site the secrets I won't show

02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:51.700
take you site the secrets I won't show

02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:23.700
Thank you for watching!

02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:56.700
aah

02:03:56.700 --> 02:04:01.700
aah

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:06.700
aah

02:04:06.700 --> 02:04:11.700
aah

02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:16.700
aah

02:04:46.700 --> 02:04:52.700
To the words I'm saying baby, I found my soul

02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:56.700
And it keeps me hanging on

02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:59.700
Understand me now

02:04:59.700 --> 02:05:06.700

02:05:06.700 --> 02:05:10.700
And it keeps me hanging on

El Mullet calling.

02:06:06.580 --> 02:06:07.580
Hello, El Mullet.

02:06:07.580 --> 02:06:08.580
How are you?

02:06:08.580 --> 02:06:09.580
Good.

02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:10.580
How about yourself?

02:06:10.580 --> 02:06:11.580
Good.

02:06:11.580 --> 02:06:15.900
I think we have a little bit of a delay, so start talking.

02:06:15.900 --> 02:06:19.980
What's on your mind?

02:06:19.980 --> 02:06:26.140
Well basically, now that we've got the news on Extreme 2 and UltraMix 3, I'm starting

02:06:26.140 --> 02:06:28.940
to get pretty pumped for this year's E3.

02:06:28.940 --> 02:06:31.340
I am absolutely pumped for this year's E3.

02:06:31.340 --> 02:06:36.820
When you consider that we have Extreme 2 and we have Ultramix 3, and we have DDR with Mario,

02:06:36.820 --> 02:06:42.580
and we have Karaoke Revolution 4, and we have God knows whatever Red Octane's going to show,

02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:47.500
and whatever Korean crap shows up in Kenshiya Hall, this is going to be a beautiful E3 for

02:06:47.500 --> 02:06:48.500
us music gamers.

02:06:48.500 --> 02:06:51.900
I'm very happy.

02:06:51.900 --> 02:06:56.500
This is going to be the best year for music games, period.

02:06:56.500 --> 02:06:59.420
And I do have something to say for all of you.

02:06:59.420 --> 02:07:00.420
Yes.

02:07:00.420 --> 02:07:03.620
What would you like to say?

02:07:03.620 --> 02:07:08.220
I was going to say anything... what I want to say to all the naysayers, to all the

02:07:08.220 --> 02:07:11.140
people who decided to come out and bitch right out

02:07:11.140 --> 02:07:12.060
of the gate

02:07:12.060 --> 02:07:14.180
as soon as the announcements were made.

02:07:14.180 --> 02:07:15.540
Shut up!

02:07:15.540 --> 02:07:19.780
You don't know what's going to be on these games outside of genie and

02:07:19.780 --> 02:07:20.540
oops.

02:07:20.540 --> 02:07:24.900
And that's two songs out of a possible sixty five plus song mix.

02:07:24.900 --> 02:07:27.860
Shut up!

02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:32.200
I agree, I agree. Those people just need to sit down and shut up until we have more information

02:07:32.200 --> 02:07:35.660
on the game. You want to know why no company wants to release

02:07:35.660 --> 02:07:41.020
information on games before E3? It's because this is what people do with, you know, any

02:07:41.020 --> 02:07:45.600
game that has a loyal fan base, is that people start just tearing the shit apart, and they

02:07:45.600 --> 02:07:50.940
dream up this own list in their head of everything they want, or the game's going to suck, and

02:07:50.940 --> 02:07:54.100
then, you know, they're disappointed because the developers have a different vision. So

02:07:54.100 --> 02:07:59.060
So you wanna know why everybody keeps it in their pants until E3?

02:07:59.060 --> 02:08:00.060
This is why.

02:08:00.060 --> 02:08:01.060
It's a perfect example.

02:08:01.060 --> 02:08:02.860
Go look at the thread and everybody bitching,

02:08:02.860 --> 02:08:08.580
Eh eh, why is oops I did it again on the game, eh eh eh.

02:08:08.580 --> 02:08:09.580
Any thoughts?

02:08:09.580 --> 02:08:15.660
Why can't it be like arcades that have all my favorite songs on them?

02:08:15.660 --> 02:08:18.460
Where's my max period from the other home version?

02:08:18.460 --> 02:08:21.600
My god, some people piss me off.

02:08:21.600 --> 02:08:23.460
This game better have Sakura.

02:08:23.460 --> 02:08:27.460
I'm not buying this game unless Sakura is in it!

02:08:27.460 --> 02:08:31.340
Jesus people, Sakura is like the most horrid song

02:08:31.340 --> 02:08:36.660
in DDRXtreme. I just... I will not buy this game unless Sakura is not in it!

02:08:36.660 --> 02:08:40.380
Ha! Got you!

02:08:40.380 --> 02:08:43.060
Sakura makes everything cool.

02:08:43.060 --> 02:08:47.340
I want as much licensed mainstream crap

02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:52.500
as humanly possible. I want to see people so pissed off

02:08:52.500 --> 02:08:57.580
This year's song list says Steam is coming out of their ears while I sit back, copy of

02:08:57.580 --> 02:09:00.740
Extreme 2, laughing my ass off.

02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.740
That's right.

02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:02.740
You know what?

02:09:02.740 --> 02:09:04.380
Let's dream for a minute here.

02:09:04.380 --> 02:09:09.220
Let's think about if I were to make DDR Extreme 2.

02:09:09.220 --> 02:09:10.780
Let's think for a minute here.

02:09:10.780 --> 02:09:14.540
What types of songs would I want to put in Extreme 2?

02:09:14.540 --> 02:09:15.540
Let me think.

02:09:15.540 --> 02:09:18.540
I'm going to make my mix here for a minute here.

02:09:18.540 --> 02:09:19.540
Let's see.

02:09:19.540 --> 02:09:23.420
have oops I did it again and genie in a bottle would definitely have to be in

02:09:23.420 --> 02:09:29.260
this and and I was trying to cue up some musical stuff but my thing is froze there

02:09:29.260 --> 02:09:38.180
we go there we go thank you okay let's see oh did the feed drop no I think we're

02:09:38.180 --> 02:09:42.480
still here I'm still with you okay delay but I'm still with you I think we had a

02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:50.380
a spot of downtime there, but we're back. Who cares? We're just like rambling. The Internet

02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:57.540
declines your request of making a custom DVR mix. Sorry, Rob. Yeah, I guess so. The Internet

02:09:57.540 --> 02:10:02.320
just didn't want that to happen. My bad. All this must not happen. I think it was live

02:10:02.320 --> 02:10:10.820
365 because we never disconnected. Shut up. I'm not sure what happened there, guys. All

02:10:10.820 --> 02:10:13.820
Alright, let's just keep rolling here, because the archives will go on.

02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:17.820
So, I guess if you want to hear what happened during the chaos moment there,

02:10:17.820 --> 02:10:20.820
just listen to the DDR Freak archive, because it'll all be there.

02:10:20.820 --> 02:10:24.820
Actually, I think if any of you guys are on the net, I need you to stop what you're doing,

02:10:24.820 --> 02:10:27.820
stop your uploads, stop whatever you're doing, close any programs that are connected to the internet.

02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:29.820
Oh, man, so much for my 6-bit torrent.

02:10:29.820 --> 02:10:30.820
We need all the bandwidth right now.

02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:31.820
It's live 365.

02:10:31.820 --> 02:10:32.820
Is it? Okay, alright.

02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:36.820
We never disconnected, it's live 365, they've done this to me too.

02:10:36.820 --> 02:10:41.460
It's the goddamn government, they're hacks-ering us.

02:10:41.460 --> 02:10:44.520
I am showing the stations up on the air and streaming, so it's just gonna take them a

02:10:44.520 --> 02:10:45.700
minute to get in, so...

02:10:45.700 --> 02:10:47.500
Oh my god, they shut off the monitor!

02:10:47.500 --> 02:10:51.380
Let's do this, let's go, Mullet, why don't I give you a call right back, we're gonna

02:10:51.380 --> 02:10:54.180
go to a music break, okay?

02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:55.620
Mullet, are you still there?

02:10:55.620 --> 02:10:58.020
They killed Mullet! Oh my god!

02:10:58.020 --> 02:10:59.940
Okay, we're gonna go to a music break and come right back, okay?

02:10:59.940 --> 02:11:01.180
I'm not dead!

02:11:01.180 --> 02:11:04.700
We'll call you back.

02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:13.700
Okay, so we're gonna do a music break real quick here. If you guys are with us, we're gonna go to a break here while everything is being burned and destroyed and it's awful.

02:11:13.700 --> 02:11:15.700
Oh my god, the choppers!

02:11:15.700 --> 02:11:19.700
Oh no, the government guys with their cell phones are going to signal us to death.

02:11:19.700 --> 02:11:20.700
I think I have a very-

02:11:20.700 --> 02:11:21.700
Do you have any reference?

02:11:21.700 --> 02:11:22.700
I have a very-

02:11:22.700 --> 02:11:23.700
Cancer!

02:11:23.700 --> 02:11:30.700
I have a very appropriate song for this break, too, and it's actually topical, so people reconnecting during this downtime will find this to be hilarious.

02:11:30.700 --> 02:11:34.700
Perhaps though, they were just thinking that, you know, that E.T. wanted the phone home,

02:11:34.700 --> 02:11:38.120
so they were just providing him with the walkie-talkie that he could do that with.

02:11:38.120 --> 02:11:41.680
They were just trying to be helpful instead of hurtful as...

02:11:41.680 --> 02:11:43.680
Let's take a minute, let's take a minute out and come back, okay?

02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:44.680
Ah, fine.

02:11:44.680 --> 02:11:45.180
Stayed

02:12:44.680 --> 02:12:49.680
I made you believe we're more than just friends

02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:52.680
Oh baby, you might seem like a crush

02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:56.680
But it doesn't mean I'm serious

02:12:56.680 --> 02:13:00.680
Cause you lose all my offenses

02:13:00.680 --> 02:13:03.680
That is just so typically me

02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:07.680
Oh baby baby up I dig in

02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:10.680
I played with your heart, got lost in a game

02:13:10.680 --> 02:13:14.680
Oh, baby, baby, oh, you think I'm in love

02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:17.680
That I've been from above

02:13:17.680 --> 02:13:19.680
I'm not that innocent

02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:36.680
Yeah, see, my problem is clear

02:13:36.680 --> 02:13:38.680
I'm dreaming away

02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:41.680
Where should I see you grow that you believe in?

02:13:41.680 --> 02:13:43.680
I saw you watching the days

02:13:43.680 --> 02:13:45.680
Can't you see I'm a fool

02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.680
In so many ways

02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:51.680
But you lose all my senses

02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:54.680
That is just so typically me

02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:56.680
Oh baby, ooh

02:13:56.680 --> 02:13:58.680
I dig in

02:13:58.680 --> 02:14:00.680
I play with your heart

02:14:00.680 --> 02:14:02.680
Got lost in the game

02:14:02.680 --> 02:14:03.680
Oh baby, baby, ooh

02:14:03.680 --> 02:14:05.680
You think I'm in love

02:14:35.680 --> 02:14:50.720
Alright, we are back here on Orange Launch Radio and an appropriate choice there, we

02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:55.320
played the 5th mix version of Oops I Did It Again during our little downtime there.

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:59.560
Sorry about that, I don't know what happened, I think a combination of Live 365 did a net

02:14:59.560 --> 02:15:05.320
fart and then we, I was trying to launch iTunes because I was going to do a gag because El

02:15:05.320 --> 02:15:08.920
Elle Mullet and I were talking about songs that we would like to see on DDR Extreme 2.

02:15:08.920 --> 02:15:11.800
Hmm, surprise, an Apple product crashing.

02:15:11.800 --> 02:15:14.400
So actually, what I'm going to do now, I know a lot of you guys are actually calling in,

02:15:14.400 --> 02:15:18.360
but I do want to give Elle Mullet a proper chance to say goodbye, so we're calling him

02:15:18.360 --> 02:15:19.360
right back.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:21.440
Hi, Elle Mullet, you there?

02:15:21.440 --> 02:15:22.440
I'm here, Skye.

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:23.440
How's it going?

02:15:23.440 --> 02:15:24.440
Good.

02:15:24.440 --> 02:15:25.440
I think we still have a little bit of that delay, but that's okay.

02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:28.240
Elle Mullet, live from the Middle East.

02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:32.960
So I don't know what happened there, but actually, I have to say the best comments, one of the

02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:36.960
The best comments I've ever seen in our chatroom came during that break.

02:15:36.960 --> 02:15:44.340
And somebody said, who has a dark Tetsuya said, it's the rapture.

02:15:44.340 --> 02:15:47.960
Like we'd be the ones disappearing during the rapture.

02:15:47.960 --> 02:15:51.140
Alright, anyway, so El Mullet.

02:15:51.140 --> 02:15:55.960
In my dream fantasy extreme too, I was always going to get to, I was going to do audio clips,

02:15:55.960 --> 02:15:59.020
but iTunes decided to kill my computer.

02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:02.380
We have, I would have, oops I did it again, Genie in a Bottle.

02:16:02.380 --> 02:16:07.380
prerogative, the New My New My A song has to be in there for sure. Vengaboys, We Like

02:16:07.380 --> 02:16:13.820
to Party definitely would be in there as well. Alice DJ, Better Off Alone. Madonna, Old School

02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:17.640
Madonna and New School Madonna would definitely have to be in it. And let's see, what else

02:16:17.640 --> 02:16:21.060
would be in there? Somebody told me, because you know that. Yeah, somebody told me that

02:16:21.060 --> 02:16:24.740
you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend and all that stuff. And then we would definitely

02:16:24.740 --> 02:16:30.860
have to have all of the American Idols as well. Oh my God, Winnie Clay. And Clay. Because

02:16:30.860 --> 02:16:53.860
I'll tell you this, if I'm interrupting, there would be 5th Mix. It would all be 5th Mix, plus random add-ons, and it would be glorious.

02:16:53.860 --> 02:16:55.860
I like the idea of DDR to speak to this.

02:16:55.860 --> 02:16:58.860
The only one who would buy the copy because, well, let's face it.

02:17:02.860 --> 02:17:05.860
Go lag. I know, we have horrible, horrible lag tonight.

02:17:05.860 --> 02:17:09.860
So, oh well. Yeah, I agree with the idea that 5th Mix would rock.

02:17:09.860 --> 02:17:13.860
Let's just pour it 5th Mix and let's try to get all the original versions of song too.

02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:16.860
Let's give the original tribal dance and all that stuff, that'd be great.

02:17:16.860 --> 02:17:19.860
But we have to have the new My New My A song in there, come on.

02:17:19.860 --> 02:17:25.860
I'm sorry, I'm going to have to go. This delay is horrible. Let's try this again.

02:17:25.860 --> 02:17:26.860
That's right. Have a good one, Emmaulet.

02:17:26.860 --> 02:17:27.860
I'm very, very, very sorry.

02:17:27.860 --> 02:17:31.860
That's right. Have a good one, Emmaulet. Take care, and I'll plug it for him. Insidepulse.com

02:17:31.860 --> 02:17:38.860
is super-duper, so visit it. I know its song needs to be in there. What? The Muppet one.

02:17:38.860 --> 02:17:39.860
Manomina.

02:17:39.860 --> 02:17:40.860
Manomina.

02:17:40.860 --> 02:17:43.680
doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-la-la-la-la-la

02:17:43.680 --> 02:17:45.260
hmm

02:17:45.260 --> 02:17:46.940
that's in a commercial now

02:17:46.940 --> 02:17:50.660
alright, we are taking calls on our sk gaining www.orangelandsradio.com

02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:52.840
click on interact with us if you are interested

02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:55.400
in giving us a call

02:17:55.400 --> 02:17:57.860
hi you're on Orangelands Radio, who's this?

02:17:57.860 --> 02:17:58.860
legendofzaku

02:17:58.860 --> 02:18:01.620
hello legendofzaku, what's under your mind buddy?

02:18:01.620 --> 02:18:05.060
well I just got a few things I managed to find I don't know I'm just

02:18:05.060 --> 02:18:08.580
trying to perpetuate the rumour cycle a little bit

02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:14.420
I'm posting up a link right now from a person's live journal.

02:18:14.420 --> 02:18:19.340
Apparently, this is going to sound strange, but just bear with me.

02:18:19.340 --> 02:18:25.580
It seems this guy who's posting on his live journal basically, you know, heard some information

02:18:25.580 --> 02:18:30.980
a while back, and I mean like about maybe two or three years ago, that they were going

02:18:30.980 --> 02:18:34.740
to bring back a new DDR arcade mix this year.

02:18:34.740 --> 02:18:41.260
And the reason why he posted is because a second person heard about this and it wasn't

02:18:41.260 --> 02:18:43.700
from the poster source.

02:18:43.700 --> 02:18:44.700
Sky?

02:18:44.700 --> 02:18:47.380
Yeah, no, no, I'm with you here.

02:18:47.380 --> 02:18:48.380
I'm here.

02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:49.380
I'm with you.

02:18:49.380 --> 02:18:50.380
I'm just listening to you.

02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:51.380
Yeah, but I posted up the link.

02:18:51.380 --> 02:18:52.380
All right.

02:18:52.380 --> 02:18:53.380
All right.

02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:54.380
I'm going to look at this link.

02:18:54.380 --> 02:18:55.380
Yeah.

02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:56.380
That's pretty much it.

02:18:56.380 --> 02:18:57.380
That's why he posted it.

02:18:57.380 --> 02:18:58.380
Okay.

02:18:58.380 --> 02:19:03.060
So, they said years ago that this was supposed to be the year the DDR comes back.

02:19:03.060 --> 02:19:06.380
Let's see, I'm going to...

02:19:06.380 --> 02:19:07.900
This comes from some guy's journal.

02:19:07.900 --> 02:19:09.140
I've seen this guy around DDR3.

02:19:09.140 --> 02:19:10.700
Cucumber is the name.

02:19:10.700 --> 02:19:15.720
New DDR arcade makes its debut in September, rumor, rumor, rumor.

02:19:15.720 --> 02:19:19.720
My first source said that an individual who has direct ties to Konami of Japan heard straight

02:19:19.720 --> 02:19:24.060
from them that DDR Extreme 2 will be previewed at Tokyo Game Show in September.

02:19:24.060 --> 02:19:27.660
They've supposedly changed the hardware to make the game un-bootlegable, although I doubt

02:19:27.660 --> 02:19:30.340
it took since December 2002 to do that.

02:19:30.340 --> 02:19:35.460
My second source said there will be a location test in October.

02:19:35.460 --> 02:19:39.540
I doubt it. Whatever. I mean, honestly, I gotta tell you, Zaku, it's

02:19:39.540 --> 02:19:42.820
another rumor to me. It seems like every three months somebody's got the rumor

02:19:42.820 --> 02:19:46.620
they have a friend who knows Konami of Japan.

02:19:46.620 --> 02:19:50.540
Yeah, but the fact that a second person found out would mean that, you know, two

02:19:50.540 --> 02:19:51.780
things. A,

02:19:51.780 --> 02:19:55.480
if the rumor is probably, you know, spread to some other person, or B,

02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:58.820
there might be a second person who might have found a credible source. So it could go

02:19:58.820 --> 02:20:03.340
either way. Well, you're right. Any of these rumors could go either way. There's tons of

02:20:03.340 --> 02:20:06.280
things out there on the internet that are probably rumors now that will turn to fact

02:20:06.280 --> 02:20:11.260
later on. You don't know. But I mean, I hope it's true. I would love it if this news were

02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:15.500
true. I hope it's true. The un-bootlegable part is kind of sad because that means we

02:20:15.500 --> 02:20:18.520
probably won't see the machines here, but something tells me we'll see them one way

02:20:18.520 --> 02:20:22.860
or another. I hope it's true. I don't know if it has anything. There's no such thing

02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:24.740
is un-bootlegable anything.

02:20:24.740 --> 02:20:25.540
Everything's pirateable.

02:20:25.540 --> 02:20:27.740
But I hope it's true.

02:20:27.740 --> 02:20:31.780
And I don't know what else to say.

02:20:31.780 --> 02:20:33.900
I mean, the signs are pretty clear right now.

02:20:33.900 --> 02:20:36.540
Paul Eteri is saying some stuff about recording a new

02:20:36.540 --> 02:20:38.420
song on Naoki.

02:20:38.420 --> 02:20:41.460
And I don't know whether or not it's adding up to

02:20:41.460 --> 02:20:43.340
something, but it's out there.

02:20:43.340 --> 02:20:48.020
It might not be true at first, but it might be something that

02:20:48.020 --> 02:20:50.220
might be the basis for an official word.

02:20:50.220 --> 02:20:52.520
It comes to that point.

02:20:52.520 --> 02:20:56.160
I see how it also adds up together, you're right, the Politarian Naoki thing kind of

02:20:56.160 --> 02:20:59.520
going along with this makes everything kind of look at up, but also you have to realize

02:20:59.520 --> 02:21:04.060
with three new games coming out in the U.S. this year, three new DDR games and a Karaoke

02:21:04.060 --> 02:21:06.960
Revolution game, which you know, it wouldn't surprise me if Naoki ever did something for

02:21:06.960 --> 02:21:12.080
that, you know, it's very possible that the Politarian thing is for one of these games.

02:21:12.080 --> 02:21:14.040
But Phil, I mean, we just have to look at the possibilities.

02:21:14.040 --> 02:21:15.080
I hope you're right.

02:21:15.080 --> 02:21:16.080
I hope you're right.

02:21:16.080 --> 02:21:18.560
I hope this guy's right.

02:21:18.560 --> 02:21:19.560
I hope I'm right.

02:21:19.560 --> 02:21:45.560
I mean, I just, you know, the only thing, I don't know, maybe Konami might pull something out of their ass in E3 that might shock us all, that might shock us all, and keep, and basically surprise the hell out of us, or, you know, maybe it might be when they drop the, when they release the new DDR games, I don't know, maybe some edit mode for some future arcade mix, now that they've already, you know, now that they have, you know, USB mode working, thank you Gran Turismo 4 for that.

02:21:45.560 --> 02:21:52.560
You know what, it wouldn't be an E3 if somebody doesn't drop a bombshell.

02:21:52.560 --> 02:21:56.560
So, I would love it for it to be to Konami, but who knows.

02:21:56.560 --> 02:22:01.560
Konami may have had it all already blown already from GamePro, thank you.

02:22:01.560 --> 02:22:02.560
So, who knows?

02:22:02.560 --> 02:22:07.560
Yeah, but you know, they might have saved some of the stuff that hasn't seen light yet.

02:22:07.560 --> 02:22:13.560
And basically, everything's ready for them to do almost about anything beyond the home release.

02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:18.760
as for saying a new arcade mix. They already have a third-party distributor up.

02:22:18.760 --> 02:22:23.560
I don't know, it shouldn't be that hard to add USB slots to replace the memory card slots.

02:22:23.560 --> 02:22:24.560
You know what? I'm glad you brought the...

02:22:24.560 --> 02:22:27.060
And the Gran Turismo 4 is probably the first thing to...

02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:30.060
I'm glad you brought the USB thing up, because I'll tell you what.

02:22:30.060 --> 02:22:36.060
One thing that is really getting me into In the Groove in the arcade is the USB support.

02:22:36.060 --> 02:22:40.560
It is phenomenal. I actually picked up a jump drive so I could check out what this does.

02:22:40.560 --> 02:22:44.360
i'll tell you what the in the group u s b support damn near sells that game to

02:22:44.360 --> 02:22:44.800
me

02:22:44.800 --> 02:22:49.080
it is it is that good dot u s b support is because not all that game almost as

02:22:49.080 --> 02:22:51.280
good as that mean a u s b

02:22:51.280 --> 02:22:54.880
i'm sorry that's the same damn thing i don't think that but this is something

02:22:54.880 --> 02:22:58.360
that actually in the arcades you know i mean it's different it's not

02:22:58.360 --> 02:22:59.240
shut up

02:22:59.240 --> 02:23:02.440
i won't be surprised that can only do that in for the

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:05.560
for further you know if they did they decided to continue my here in the

02:23:05.560 --> 02:23:08.880
arcades are not me should have minds in their game and

02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:11.400
and show the in-the-groove folks how it feels

02:23:11.400 --> 02:23:16.500
except they won't be mines, they'll be super bad steps, or they'll be bombs or

02:23:16.500 --> 02:23:21.660
something, you know? And take it to the in-the-groove folks and let them know how it feels a little bit, but don't

02:23:21.660 --> 02:23:23.360
take the hand-plants idea

02:23:23.360 --> 02:23:26.880
leave it in that other game

02:23:26.880 --> 02:23:30.320
Konami has the ability to wipe them out for all they care

02:23:30.320 --> 02:23:32.060
but you know, they're just waiting

02:23:32.060 --> 02:23:34.480
they're waiting to see how in-the-groove does

02:23:34.480 --> 02:23:38.480
and then they'll probably, you know, they'll probably bring out their big guns, just to hold on to

02:23:38.480 --> 02:23:41.880
their market that's my prediction right there well we will see it if that's

02:23:41.880 --> 02:23:44.880
they're playing the waiting game it's gonna be it's only do it's gonna be a

02:23:44.880 --> 02:23:48.300
very interesting e3 I would I would love nothing more than for Konami and red

02:23:48.300 --> 02:23:51.400
octane to be right across from each other but we know what happened yes

02:23:51.400 --> 02:23:55.640
rivals just holding fists like like like as if you know like a Mortal Kombat

02:23:55.640 --> 02:24:00.800
versus green you know what though despite despite anything negative I've

02:24:00.800 --> 02:24:05.760
said about in the groove in the past competition benefits all of us in the

02:24:05.760 --> 02:24:10.640
long run. So, I think that's it right there. Competition will benefit us all.

02:24:10.640 --> 02:24:18.440
That basically spurs innovation. Alright, I'm cutting you off now, Zaku. Closing time.

02:24:18.440 --> 02:24:22.400
You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here, buddy. Alright, bye.

02:24:22.400 --> 02:24:26.360
Nice quote of a song there. You're right. Thank you.

02:24:26.360 --> 02:24:33.000
What, what, what, what? I have a cousin who knows a guy, who knows a girl, who's dating

02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:39.040
a guy who knows somebody at Konami. No, get this, okay, this is great. The new arcade

02:24:39.040 --> 02:24:41.640
system, it's going to have this little thing in the background. It's actually going to

02:24:41.640 --> 02:24:47.140
be like some sort of score Italian thing. If you do really good in it, you get contacted

02:24:47.140 --> 02:24:55.400
by aliens that actually take you up in their starship to go serve other aliens, all like

02:24:55.400 --> 02:25:02.120
the last star fighter. It's fucking awesome. Konami is taking on the universe, man. Loki,

02:25:02.120 --> 02:25:06.120
Okay, shut up. We got another call. You're on Orange Lounge Radio.

02:25:06.120 --> 02:25:09.120
Hello?

02:25:09.120 --> 02:25:13.120
Hi. Did you have to talk to your mom there in the background or something?

02:25:13.120 --> 02:25:16.120
It sounded like you were talking to somebody in the background.

02:25:16.120 --> 02:25:18.120
No, that was just someone else.

02:25:18.120 --> 02:25:22.120
Hi, someone else. Alright, what's up? What's on your mind?

02:25:22.120 --> 02:25:27.120
Actually, the first question I have is about the After Printer Pad.

02:25:27.120 --> 02:25:28.120
Okay.

02:25:28.120 --> 02:25:43.120
I mean originally I was going to get the bundle for In the Groove with the ignition pad, but now, I mean, I saw all these screenshots that you guys showed, and you say it's probably, you know, like the best metal pad to get, for the Cobalt Flux at least.

02:25:43.120 --> 02:25:45.120
I haven't played Cobalt Flux, so I can't give an opinion on that.

02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:47.120
I'm just going to save it a little bit and save up more money.

02:25:47.120 --> 02:25:50.120
I'll tell you what, have you...

02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:52.120
I'm wondering if I should just save up.

02:25:52.120 --> 02:25:57.040
Well, okay, I have a Cobalt Flux and I just played on the afterburner.

02:25:57.040 --> 02:26:00.640
I would honestly rather save the hundred dollars than just play on the afterburner.

02:26:00.640 --> 02:26:03.440
I actually prefer the afterburner over the Cobalt Flux.

02:26:03.440 --> 02:26:07.480
I actually, we also got to play on ignition 3.0, which is basically the new ignition.

02:26:07.480 --> 02:26:11.880
It's just now they've taken the D, the arrows, and they've D-DDR'd them, and they're just

02:26:11.880 --> 02:26:14.760
these generic orange arrows now, and also has USB support.

02:26:14.760 --> 02:26:19.080
The ignition 3.0 honestly did nothing for me that ignition 2.0 didn't already do.

02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:23.720
So Ignition 3.0 is the exact same as all the other Ignitions they put out, but After Burner,

02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:28.720
if you've got the money to drop, you really have to evaluate, how much will I use this

02:26:28.720 --> 02:26:30.720
thing?

02:26:30.720 --> 02:26:33.980
If you think you're going to use it a lot, it's something you're going to play every

02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:37.560
day or every other day, make a part of your exercise routine, yes, I say it's worth the

02:26:37.560 --> 02:26:38.560
money.

02:26:38.560 --> 02:26:42.640
But if you honestly evaluate how much you play DDR, and see, for somebody like me, even

02:26:42.640 --> 02:26:46.040
though I talk a lot about DDR, how much do I actually go play it at home?

02:26:46.040 --> 02:26:47.880
I don't actually play at home a whole lot.

02:26:47.880 --> 02:26:52.240
I prefer to go to the arcades. So for me, I don't see the point in getting a metal stage.

02:26:52.240 --> 02:26:56.720
I would rather have the ignition pad because it's not worth it to me. But if you don't

02:26:56.720 --> 02:27:00.240
get to play DDR in the arcades a lot or whatever, and you think you're going to play this a

02:27:00.240 --> 02:27:02.960
lot at home, I say go for it. You won't regret it.

02:27:02.960 --> 02:27:08.760
Yeah, yeah, I definitely don't get to play in this much in arcades, so that's what I'm

02:27:08.760 --> 02:27:09.760
thinking about.

02:27:09.760 --> 02:27:10.760
All right.

02:27:10.760 --> 02:27:14.600
But then again, I'm thinking how long does it last?

02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:19.600
You know, that's a good question. I don't know, I'm not Red Octane, but I know it took

02:27:19.600 --> 02:27:25.060
a lot of abuse in the groove night. People were playing with shoes on and heels and everything

02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:28.220
and playing the crazy songs and it seemed to hold up.

02:27:28.220 --> 02:27:31.840
The arrows are not acrylic. I'm pretty sure there's some form of plexiglass, so they're

02:27:31.840 --> 02:27:35.180
not going to smash if you step on them 20 times.

02:27:35.180 --> 02:27:39.840
So I just, I don't know though, but you have to look at, I've had ignition pads that die

02:27:39.840 --> 02:27:43.280
after six to nine months, so I'm hoping it's not the same thing with the afterburner, especially

02:27:43.280 --> 02:27:46.180
considering that kind of investment but unfortunately until these things hit the

02:27:46.180 --> 02:27:49.520
market we won't know how long they really last so nobody can really say

02:27:49.520 --> 02:27:53.200
it's you're taking a little bit of a gamble I would say if red octane has

02:27:53.200 --> 02:27:57.660
some reasonable type and I'm not familiar with red octane directly I've

02:27:57.660 --> 02:28:01.680
always bought their products in stores when I bought their products but if they

02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:05.480
have some type of warranty replacement program as long as it's reasonable I say

02:28:05.480 --> 02:28:08.760
go for it you never because you don't know how long these things gonna last

02:28:08.760 --> 02:28:12.120
Yeah, yeah, right. I'll probably get it then, thanks.

02:28:12.120 --> 02:28:15.480
Alright, no problem. Anything else for us?

02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:20.960
Probably. I mean, I have a lot of opinions now in the group since I actually finally got to play it last week.

02:28:20.960 --> 02:28:22.280
Alright, what do you think?

02:28:22.280 --> 02:28:25.480
So, I mean, it's pretty interesting. Like,

02:28:25.480 --> 02:28:28.920
I don't like how it's such a...

02:28:28.920 --> 02:28:32.560
It's not as varied as DDR is with the music,

02:28:32.560 --> 02:28:37.720
which is probably my biggest problem. But otherwise, it looks pretty good. I mean,

02:28:37.720 --> 02:28:40.720
I mean, the difficulty is really hard, but whatever.

02:28:40.720 --> 02:28:41.720
Yeah, yeah.

02:28:41.720 --> 02:28:45.720
I'm willing to dish out money for the home version anyway just for something new to play.

02:28:45.720 --> 02:28:48.720
Yeah, I mean, you know, it's what, going to be what, 30 bucks, I think?

02:28:48.720 --> 02:28:50.720
I don't know, don't quote me on that, 40 at most.

02:28:50.720 --> 02:28:51.720
Yeah.

02:28:51.720 --> 02:28:52.720
And you get a t-shirt.

02:28:52.720 --> 02:28:53.720
Yeah.

02:28:53.720 --> 02:28:56.720
Whatever, it'll, you know.

02:28:56.720 --> 02:28:57.720
A keychain.

02:28:57.720 --> 02:29:01.720
People that are dedicated to these games enough to be tuning into this show are probably not

02:29:01.720 --> 02:29:03.720
going to regret the purchase, honestly.

02:29:03.720 --> 02:29:05.720
Just go for it.

02:29:05.720 --> 02:29:06.720
Yeah, definitely.

02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:10.800
definitely. Alright, well I'm gonna let you go so we can take some more calls, but thanks for calling in, alright?

02:29:10.800 --> 02:29:13.860
There will be a day where I will... Alright, have a good one, buddy.

02:29:13.860 --> 02:29:17.360
...review in the group someday. Goodbye. Alright,

02:29:17.360 --> 02:29:21.360
let's take one more call here. Hi, you are on Orange Launch Radio.

02:29:21.360 --> 02:29:24.880
Hey guys. Hello, is this Angel?

02:29:24.880 --> 02:29:28.040
Yep. What's on your mind? You're not here tonight.

02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:32.560
I know. What's going on? Sicker than crap.

02:29:32.560 --> 02:29:36.480
Oh, sorry to hear it. Well, I know that you

02:29:36.480 --> 02:29:40.600
feel better, first off, rest up and feel better. What did you think, because you had to go to the

02:29:40.600 --> 02:29:44.040
in the group party because I had to beg somebody to go with me because Jamie had

02:29:44.040 --> 02:29:44.680
to,

02:29:44.680 --> 02:29:48.520
Matt had to work and Jamie had the school thing, so I was begging Live Journal and you

02:29:48.520 --> 02:29:52.320
took it up, so you had to go, what did you think?

02:29:52.320 --> 02:29:55.880
I thought it was awesome. It's going to give me something to do,

02:29:55.880 --> 02:30:00.240
you know, while I'm waiting for Extreme

02:30:00.240 --> 02:30:04.640
2 and Ultra Mix 3, so it's just going to be a filler

02:30:04.640 --> 02:30:07.760
And, you know, I like both games differently.

02:30:07.760 --> 02:30:10.160
You know, I like DDR for DDR, and I like, you know,

02:30:10.160 --> 02:30:11.200
In the Groove for In the Groove.

02:30:11.200 --> 02:30:14.520
So I'm not going to sit there and knock it, because, I mean,

02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:17.240
I'm still getting exercise, and I'm still liking the music

02:30:17.240 --> 02:30:22.920
that, you know, either game offers, so, you know.

02:30:22.920 --> 02:30:24.760
I think that's a very fair way to look at it.

02:30:24.760 --> 02:30:25.280
You know what?

02:30:25.280 --> 02:30:28.800
It's just, bitch and cry and moan all you want.

02:30:28.800 --> 02:30:31.800
Both these games are out there, and they're going to be

02:30:31.800 --> 02:30:34.520
available, so why not eat them up and just enjoy what both

02:30:34.520 --> 02:30:36.520
games have to offer.

02:30:36.520 --> 02:30:39.440
And I'm glad that you guys liked the After Burner, because

02:30:39.440 --> 02:30:42.600
I wanted to try it, but I was just not wearing the right

02:30:42.600 --> 02:30:44.160
shoes that day.

02:30:44.160 --> 02:30:47.440
So I was just like, eh, I don't want to kill myself.

02:30:47.440 --> 02:30:52.880
So I might actually end up buying that with the games.

02:30:52.880 --> 02:30:54.240
Yeah, it's going to be interesting.

02:30:54.240 --> 02:30:55.800
Oh, and you forgot.

02:30:55.800 --> 02:30:58.920
Yeah, yeah, Angel?

02:30:58.920 --> 02:31:03.720
You forgot the little spoof about you and the bar when the

02:31:03.720 --> 02:31:07.720
I was trying to play. That was pretty funny when we already did the press room.

02:31:07.720 --> 02:31:12.720
Oh, God, that's right. Okay, remember this? Okay, because they took the stool away from

02:31:12.720 --> 02:31:17.720
Tody, what I ended up doing when we were in the media room is you decided you were going

02:31:17.720 --> 02:31:22.520
to play some insane song. So I was like, here, hold on to my hand, and you can use my hand

02:31:22.520 --> 02:31:24.720
as the bar. And he did it. It worked.

02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:27.400
This is how people are going to have to do it at home. He held on to my hand, not in

02:31:27.400 --> 02:31:31.360
a homosexual way, but he held on to my hand as the bar, and he played, and it actually

02:31:31.360 --> 02:31:36.440
Well the guys that whoever was dancing next to you. I didn't know him, but you um. I think his name is Andres

02:31:36.440 --> 02:31:41.360
I'm Oregon okay. Well. He did the same thing and I actually snapped a picture of it

02:31:41.360 --> 02:31:47.360
Yeah, somebody commented on the website about that like do is somebody using a hand as the bar yes because we and I would like

02:31:47.360 --> 02:31:49.620
To say that was my idea copyright. It was my idea

02:31:50.720 --> 02:31:52.720
patent pending great

02:31:53.280 --> 02:32:00.040
All right anyway, huh? I had a pirate and hide everyone there. I'm sorry. I'm not there, but hey yeah feel better

02:32:00.040 --> 02:32:04.040
I take it we're not meeting at CCL on Tuesday.

02:32:04.040 --> 02:32:08.040
Actually, I think we are. Talk to your girlfriend.

02:32:08.040 --> 02:32:10.040
Okay. Alright, will do.

02:32:10.040 --> 02:32:12.040
Alright, have a good one, Angel. Thanks for calling.

02:32:12.040 --> 02:32:13.040
Alright, bye guys.

02:32:13.040 --> 02:32:14.040
Bye.

02:32:14.040 --> 02:32:15.040
Have a good one.

02:32:15.040 --> 02:32:17.040
I was arm raping. It was pretty hot.

02:32:17.040 --> 02:32:18.040
It was hot.

02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:23.040
One other thing I got to say. I noticed, because sometimes I look at people chatting on different forums,

02:32:23.040 --> 02:32:26.720
How many different places did you say Rob took

02:32:26.720 --> 02:32:31.280
three pictures of my ass and put them on the Orange Lounge radio gallery for you all to see?

02:32:31.280 --> 02:32:35.720
I think I put it on like two different places. It was on my live journal and then

02:32:35.720 --> 02:32:40.000
I know I commented on the Orange Lounge site. That might have been it.

02:32:40.000 --> 02:32:43.160
It just seemed like everywhere I was reading you said something about, God, Rob takes

02:32:43.160 --> 02:32:44.400
all these pictures of my ass.

02:32:44.400 --> 02:32:50.000
Well, I mean, it is a nice ass. It doesn't even exist. I don't even have one at my body weight.

02:32:50.000 --> 02:32:55.000
You know what, I was just trying to get pictures of hamplants because I was actually going to do something with like no ham.

02:32:55.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I don't believe you.

02:32:56.000 --> 02:32:57.000
You're right, it was all about your ass.

02:32:57.000 --> 02:32:58.000
Alright.

02:32:58.000 --> 02:32:59.000
Hi, you're on Orange House Radio.

02:32:59.000 --> 02:33:00.000
Person on Skype line.

02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:05.000
Greetings from New York, it's the one and only Ronma.

02:33:05.000 --> 02:33:06.000
How you guys doing?

02:33:06.000 --> 02:33:07.000
Good, how are you Ronma?

02:33:07.000 --> 02:33:08.000
What's on your mind?

02:33:08.000 --> 02:33:09.000
Pretty good.

02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:15.000
I want to give you my quick anime boss review wrap up in like a few minutes.

02:33:15.000 --> 02:33:18.000
Make it really, really, really quick because you're actually breaking up a little bit.

02:33:18.000 --> 02:33:23.000
Your voice is breaking there, so make it quick.

02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.000
Crap, I'm going to make it really quick.

02:33:25.000 --> 02:33:28.000
Anime Boss was great, I'm going to play Didi of Forever.

02:33:28.000 --> 02:33:31.000
The Tokyo Game Action Guy, say hi.

02:33:31.000 --> 02:33:32.000
The masquerade kind of sucked.

02:33:32.000 --> 02:33:37.000
It seems if you made your own costume, but you wore shoes, you automatically got disqualified.

02:33:37.000 --> 02:33:41.000
What? You wore shoes? You got disqualified? What the hell?

02:33:41.000 --> 02:33:43.000
Whatever.

02:33:43.000 --> 02:33:44.000
Well, you know what?

02:33:44.000 --> 02:33:47.440
I actually, we need to get out to some anime cons and get our name out there some more.

02:33:47.440 --> 02:33:48.440
Go into Kaname.

02:33:48.440 --> 02:33:49.440
I need to go or something.

02:33:49.440 --> 02:33:50.440
We need to get a little room.

02:33:50.440 --> 02:33:51.840
I want to travel to the East Coast.

02:33:51.840 --> 02:33:54.040
Some East Coast person, fly us out there.

02:33:54.040 --> 02:33:56.200
We'll do a table thing or whatever.

02:33:56.200 --> 02:33:57.200
It'll be fun.

02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:02.240
Dude, if y'all fly out to East Coast, y'all can stay in my room for free.

02:34:02.240 --> 02:34:05.560
I just, you promise not to take advantage of us, right?

02:34:05.560 --> 02:34:06.560
Never.

02:34:06.560 --> 02:34:07.560
All right.

02:34:07.560 --> 02:34:08.560
Sounds good.

02:34:08.560 --> 02:34:09.560
Well, thank you.

02:34:09.560 --> 02:34:10.560
Should I get an opportunity to cosplay?

02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:11.560
Yeah.

02:34:11.560 --> 02:34:12.560
Thank you for the offer.

02:34:12.560 --> 02:34:13.560
We appreciate it.

02:34:13.560 --> 02:34:16.920
Anyway, buddy, because you're kind of breaking up, I'm going to let you go.

02:34:16.920 --> 02:34:19.040
But have a good one, okay?

02:34:19.040 --> 02:34:20.040
You too.

02:34:20.040 --> 02:34:21.040
All right.

02:34:21.040 --> 02:34:22.040
Bye.

02:34:22.040 --> 02:34:23.040
All right.

02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:24.040
We're going to go ahead and close the Skype line for now.

02:34:24.040 --> 02:34:25.040
Sorry for you guys who weren't able to get in.

02:34:25.040 --> 02:34:28.320
It's just very, very, very, very crowded tonight.

02:34:28.320 --> 02:34:31.200
We're going to go to a quick break because I have to go to the restroom.

02:34:31.200 --> 02:34:33.640
And when we come back from this break, we're going to get into the FUs of the week.

02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:37.680
So you can start sending those in to Skye in the chat room, and we'll get to those.

02:34:37.680 --> 02:34:40.400
But please, please, you have to keep them quick tonight.

02:34:40.400 --> 02:34:43.200
They will get cut off if they're too long.

02:34:43.200 --> 02:34:47.600
So we'll be back with the FUs of the week.

02:34:47.600 --> 02:34:51.520
And in this break, I figure we can do some 2DX music, because we're kind of neglecting

02:34:51.520 --> 02:34:52.600
Beat Media tonight.

02:34:52.600 --> 02:34:56.960
So let's do, I want to hear Daisuke, because that song's cool.

02:34:56.960 --> 02:35:00.760
And then I'll throw in some Taku for Jamie, because I know she likes that stuff.

02:35:00.760 --> 02:35:02.900
So we'll just make it a two-song break.

02:35:02.900 --> 02:35:09.900
And then we'll come back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

02:35:32.900 --> 02:35:35.900
I brought you a super city boy

02:35:37.900 --> 02:35:41.900
Imagine that you're a godfather, you were free for me

02:35:43.900 --> 02:35:46.900
Every day was dying, now I've become a god

02:35:46.900 --> 02:35:49.900
Every night I'm dreaming of falling in my dreams

02:35:49.900 --> 02:35:52.900
I can't feel no love, I'm on my own

02:35:52.900 --> 02:35:56.900
I love my class, but they're more pretty

02:35:56.900 --> 02:35:59.900
Will you tell me no? How do you feel me?

02:35:59.900 --> 02:36:03.900
Will you show me now? I wanna dance with you all

02:36:03.900 --> 02:36:08.900
Like now, I want to walk for you Everytime, everywhere

02:36:08.900 --> 02:36:12.900
Are we sure we got your own best love?

02:36:42.900 --> 02:36:46.900
Will you show me now, I wanna dance with you all

02:36:46.900 --> 02:36:49.400
Like now, I want to walk for you

02:36:49.400 --> 02:36:52.400
Everytime, everywhere

02:36:52.400 --> 02:36:56.400
I wish I would get to hold this love

02:36:56.400 --> 02:36:58.400
Daddy's a cat

02:38:56.400 --> 02:39:00.400
Gah... Gah... Gah... Gah...

02:39:00.400 --> 02:39:04.400
Gah... Gah... Gah...

02:39:34.400 --> 02:39:36.400
I know

02:40:34.400 --> 02:40:52.320
Hi ho, Kermit the Frog here informing you that today's broadcast of Orange Lounge Radio

02:40:52.320 --> 02:41:01.200
is brought to you by the letter D, the letter A, and the number 59.

02:41:01.200 --> 02:41:07.840
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and now it's time for that part of the show where

02:41:07.840 --> 02:41:12.080
we get a little bit angsty, and we do the FUs of the Week, which by the way, we have

02:41:12.080 --> 02:41:14.640
new background music for tonight, all of us.

02:41:14.640 --> 02:41:15.640
Yay!

02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:16.640
I already missed my old one.

02:41:16.640 --> 02:41:19.680
If you were getting sick of those songs, well, you know I could start it off with your old

02:41:19.680 --> 02:41:23.360
one and then get into the new one, because I do kind of like the way it started, but,

02:41:23.360 --> 02:41:24.360
you know.

02:41:24.360 --> 02:41:25.360
This one starts off and changes.

02:41:25.360 --> 02:41:26.360
Alright, we'll do that.

02:41:26.360 --> 02:41:30.960
Um, okay, so, why is it we do the FUs of the Week every single week, Dark Shark, right?

02:41:30.960 --> 02:41:32.960
Fuck it

02:41:46.680 --> 02:41:48.680
My F you goes toward

02:41:49.760 --> 02:41:55.520
This little insurance company. It's bumpy ITT le and when I first looked at it

02:41:55.520 --> 02:42:01.520
Well, no, I was saying maybe it's a title and they misspelled it, but no.

02:42:01.520 --> 02:42:11.520
Anyway, and actually I transferred from person to person, then to another claims company, then to another claims company here in Sacramento.

02:42:11.520 --> 02:42:17.520
And it's just been stupid. He calls me and says, call me back, blah, blah, blah.

02:42:17.520 --> 02:42:20.520
So I leave him two fucking messages and he never calls me back, the bastard.

02:42:20.520 --> 02:42:26.520
So, I'm going to have to wait again to find out when I get my damn money to fix my damn car.

02:42:26.520 --> 02:42:32.520
Um, my fiance was supposed to hammer my, uh, fender back into place so that I could at least drive it.

02:42:32.520 --> 02:42:33.520
No, it rained.

02:42:33.520 --> 02:42:35.520
Sorry!

02:42:35.520 --> 02:42:39.520
Um, you know, I just really miss having a car.

02:42:39.520 --> 02:42:43.520
I feel like, like my left arm's been cut off.

02:42:43.520 --> 02:42:47.520
You know, you can function without a left arm, but it fucking sucks.

02:42:47.520 --> 02:42:49.520
And that's how I feel.

02:42:49.520 --> 02:43:02.520
Um, uh, apart from that, um, you know, fuck the people who have no sense of adventure and don't like anything new.

02:43:02.520 --> 02:43:05.520
Because we don't fucking give it a chance!

02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:07.520
Okay, I'm done.

02:43:07.520 --> 02:43:10.520
And now we move on to Loki.

02:43:10.520 --> 02:43:17.520
I love this song.

02:43:40.520 --> 02:43:47.520
I bought new, cheaper cartridges, and I also got a program for free that locks the cartridge

02:44:10.520 --> 02:44:19.040
and the value so that it will just work until it's done. Also, fuck you to stupid people

02:44:19.040 --> 02:44:23.820
driving your cars, because for some reason you just don't understand what that stupid

02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:28.300
little flashy light is that's on the corner of your cars. Guess what? It's a turn signal.

02:44:28.300 --> 02:44:33.580
People use it to signal when they're changing lanes. Maybe you should learn how to do that.

02:44:33.580 --> 02:44:39.600
Thank you. And, um, fuck you to Ridley Scott for wasting two and a half hours of my life

02:44:39.600 --> 02:44:44.940
with a crappy movie called Kingdom of Heaven. Should have known that it was going to suck

02:44:44.940 --> 02:44:50.040
when the word heaven was in the title, but you know what? Guess what? The movie sucked.

02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:54.860
It's basically if you took all the battles from Lord of the Rings and made them anticlimactic,

02:44:54.860 --> 02:45:04.580
that would be the movie. Enjoy. It sucked. And then finally, fuck you to the really crappy

02:45:04.580 --> 02:45:14.580
The first party I had in Final Fantasy XI, I've been, like, not playing for, like, a while now, and I finally got back in the plane, and the first thing I get is a party that lasts for two battles, and then is over.

02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:19.580
Fucking. Sucked. Ass.

02:45:19.580 --> 02:45:31.580
And then, um, finally, um, fuck you to Fox for having Family Guy at eight o'clock, because I want to watch it, and I'm going to miss it.

02:45:31.580 --> 02:45:37.580
You know what? Some of us aren't reliant on television for our source of entertainment.

02:46:01.580 --> 02:46:06.580
I was like, I hit the point where I'm like, I don't want to do anything at all, ever, except stay at home and lie in bed all day.

02:46:06.580 --> 02:46:09.580
So that's kind of the weekend I have, so F you to laziness.

02:46:09.580 --> 02:46:18.580
F you to the fact that we were a little bit disorganized in making E3 plans, so we're kind of stuck in a not-so-great hotel, but that's alright, because at least we're going, so I'm very happy about that.

02:46:18.580 --> 02:46:21.580
By the way, I am going, for sure. Absolutely. By the way, I forgot to tell you.

02:46:21.580 --> 02:46:22.580
Thanks.

02:46:22.580 --> 02:46:23.580
I found out.

02:46:23.580 --> 02:46:26.580
And maybe this time, the hooker will see Brad again.

02:46:26.580 --> 02:46:28.580
Yeah, that would be great.

02:46:28.580 --> 02:46:31.220
So let's see is that about it?

02:46:31.220 --> 02:46:34.420
I mean if you do the fact that I have not one not two

02:46:34.420 --> 02:46:40.060
But three classes to teach next week and one of them is on a Saturday f you to working on Saturdays

02:46:40.060 --> 02:46:41.940
That's a horrible horrible fate

02:46:41.940 --> 02:46:46.040
That anybody who works a Monday through Friday age five job should I have to do is working Saturday?

02:46:46.620 --> 02:46:49.820
Amen to that I did that last week so f you to Saturday working

02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:53.740
But then I get the whole next week off, so I guess I can't bitch too much. What can I say?

02:46:53.740 --> 02:47:00.740
Alright, let's go over to Tody and find out Tody's FUs for tonight.

02:47:00.780 --> 02:47:06.180
First one from the Wednesday night, fuck pretty much the entire city of San Francisco for

02:47:06.180 --> 02:47:11.940
having like a transportation system that doesn't make any fucking sense. Why do I have to drive

02:47:11.940 --> 02:47:17.840
like ten blocks down streets that don't make me make a left hand turn just to get to a

02:47:17.840 --> 02:47:24.240
parking garage that charges me $11 for like three hours and five minutes kiss

02:47:24.240 --> 02:47:29.560
my ass I wanted those two dollars back anyway and then the other one I have is

02:47:29.560 --> 02:47:34.360
a fuck California statutory rape laws going back to the myspace thing earlier

02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.800

02:48:14.920 --> 02:48:21.280
2. It's all about oops. 3 snaps. FU to Family Guy for distracting me from the show and probably

02:48:21.280 --> 02:48:26.200
keeping me from even hearing the FUs. Hey! Get a VCR. FU to anyone that doesn't see Crash.

02:48:26.200 --> 02:48:29.520
It was amazing. It's got to have a Best Picture nomination locked. Okay, that's not really

02:48:29.520 --> 02:48:37.400
an FU, but more of me whoring Crash out. Jin4576 says, FU to Finals Week and work sucking.

02:48:37.400 --> 02:48:41.760
Ranma says, FU to the DDR fanboys and girls that are beefing about in the groove. It's

02:48:41.760 --> 02:48:45.060

And you guys are so angsty.

02:51:02.020 --> 02:51:03.020
We must talk.

02:51:03.020 --> 02:51:04.020
I'm proud.

02:51:04.020 --> 02:51:05.020
I'm proud.

02:51:05.020 --> 02:51:06.020
We must talk about something.

02:51:06.020 --> 02:51:07.020
Okay, what, Logie?

02:51:07.020 --> 02:51:08.020
What's up?

02:51:08.020 --> 02:51:09.020
Well, we didn't talk about Red Octane's...

02:51:09.020 --> 02:51:10.020
We didn't!

02:51:10.020 --> 02:51:11.020
I was just about to get to it.

02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:12.020
If you'd hold on.

02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:14.140
Oh, I don't know where you're going.

02:51:14.140 --> 02:51:15.140
There's no set plan.

02:51:15.140 --> 02:51:16.140
Yeah, you're right.

02:51:16.140 --> 02:51:19.340
That's the wonderful thing about this show is that there's no set plan.

02:51:19.340 --> 02:51:23.020
Orange Lounge Radio, no set plan.

02:51:23.020 --> 02:51:25.460
Orange Lounge Radio and the Bush presidency.

02:51:25.460 --> 02:51:33.660
to see. Eh, we don't have a plan. Alright, Guitar Hero is the new game that Red Octane

02:51:33.660 --> 02:51:36.540
announced this week, but this is interesting because we're not sure to what extent they

02:51:36.540 --> 02:51:41.440
actually meant to announce this, because they actually ended up taking down their website

02:51:41.440 --> 02:51:46.020
for it, so they're kind of trying to pretend it didn't exist. I think it's one of those

02:51:46.020 --> 02:51:51.540
cases where it was an E3 surprise. It was supposed to be a surprise at E3, and surprise!

02:51:51.540 --> 02:51:58.540
somebody leaked your website out, so now the whole internet knows about it, so oh well.

02:51:58.540 --> 02:52:03.580
Red Octane is going to be doing Guitar Hero for PlayStation 2 in the fall of this year.

02:52:03.580 --> 02:52:08.980
It's interesting, by the way, to note that Red Octane for a long time, and I don't know

02:52:08.980 --> 02:52:13.820
if they still are, but at least I know previously when the Guitar Freaks games were big on PlayStation

02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:19.400
2, they were doing five-button guitar controllers that were for use with the Guitar Freaks.

02:52:19.400 --> 02:52:22.160
So it's very interesting that, um, you know, they're doing this.

02:52:22.160 --> 02:52:24.920
Is this a game to try and promote sales of those controllers?

02:52:24.920 --> 02:52:26.420
Or will it be a whole new controller?

02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:27.640
We don't know just yet.

02:52:27.640 --> 02:52:30.440
But I do know a lot of people have bitched about the fact that there have been no new

02:52:30.440 --> 02:52:31.860
Guitar Freak games.

02:52:31.860 --> 02:52:35.500
And not to say that this game is going to be a Guitar Freaks clone, we don't know, but

02:52:35.500 --> 02:52:36.960
we can kind of, you know.

02:52:36.960 --> 02:52:42.200
Basing my judgement only on their website and just how it looked, they put a lot of

02:52:42.200 --> 02:52:46.560
detail on that website, and if that's the amount of detail in the game, it should be

02:52:46.560 --> 02:52:47.560
really good.

02:52:47.560 --> 02:52:48.560
Well here's what's interesting.

02:52:48.560 --> 02:52:50.920
guys that are assuming that because Red Octane is putting

02:52:50.920 --> 02:52:53.720
it out means it's going to be like in the groove, you'd be

02:52:53.720 --> 02:52:56.600
wrong, because harmonics is actually the focus of

02:52:56.600 --> 02:52:57.840
development in this game.

02:52:57.840 --> 02:53:02.080
Harmonics did in, or I almost said in the groove, frequency

02:53:02.080 --> 02:53:05.760
and amplitude, and they helped with karaoke revolution.

02:53:05.760 --> 02:53:07.320
And what else did they do?

02:53:07.320 --> 02:53:09.280
There's another big one I'm not thinking of.

02:53:09.280 --> 02:53:11.760
But harmonics, you know, they put out, frequency and

02:53:11.760 --> 02:53:14.320
amplitude especially were games that kind of were

02:53:14.320 --> 02:53:15.240
underrated.

02:53:15.240 --> 02:53:16.760
So it would be very interesting to see what they

02:53:16.760 --> 02:53:17.680
come up with for this.

02:53:17.680 --> 02:53:20.040
Plus, they must have their own studio or something,

02:53:20.040 --> 02:53:22.400
because they get these great original stuff.

02:53:22.400 --> 02:53:25.080
And then Karaoke Revolution had a lot of stuff as well.

02:53:25.080 --> 02:53:28.400
They redid cover songs, but it was all pretty good.

02:53:28.400 --> 02:53:29.720
So it should be interesting.

02:53:29.720 --> 02:53:33.120
Now, they had a website at guitarherogame.com,

02:53:33.120 --> 02:53:36.800
but it got taken down as soon as the web's DDR Freak put out

02:53:36.800 --> 02:53:38.680
a press release on this too.

02:53:38.680 --> 02:53:43.360
I believe it was either Games Are Fun or somebody

02:53:43.360 --> 02:53:45.320
had said it first.

02:53:45.320 --> 02:53:50.880
I think it was Games are Fun originally put the story out there, so everybody got a hold

02:53:50.880 --> 02:53:51.880
of this.

02:53:51.880 --> 02:53:53.080
But this is the other interesting thing.

02:53:53.080 --> 02:53:55.760
Now this goes back to way in the beginning of the show.

02:53:55.760 --> 02:53:59.160
You were talking about some guy was giving you their card and talking about Red Octane.

02:53:59.160 --> 02:54:04.200
They also have a site called BAGuitarHero.com, which also got taken down, but they're actually

02:54:04.200 --> 02:54:08.960
having a contest to get bands in the game.

02:54:08.960 --> 02:54:13.080
So maybe the guy you were talking to was one of these folks trying to get their music in

02:54:13.080 --> 02:54:14.640
the new Guitar Hero game.

02:54:14.640 --> 02:54:17.680
I still think he was macking on me. Maybe, but you never know.

02:54:17.680 --> 02:54:22.240
Okay. Alright. What is this game going to include? Well,

02:54:22.240 --> 02:54:26.520
the site indicated before it got taken down that it would have songs made famous

02:54:26.520 --> 02:54:27.160
by

02:54:27.160 --> 02:54:30.720
Jimi Hendrix, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and White Zombie.

02:54:30.720 --> 02:54:34.960
Of course, when they say the term made famous by, you can pick up that it's going to be

02:54:34.960 --> 02:54:35.680
covers.

02:54:35.680 --> 02:54:39.440
But, you know, Karaoke Revolution, the covers weren't

02:54:39.440 --> 02:54:43.800
that bad until they crossed over into DDR, then they were pretty bad. I don't know man, White Zombie's

02:54:43.800 --> 02:54:51.200
pretty awesome. Yeah, it should be interesting. So that's all we know for now. Of course we'll

02:54:51.200 --> 02:54:57.520
know more after E3. So we shall see. I hope they have this game playable there. We'll

02:54:57.520 --> 02:55:00.480
see. Well it seems like it might be a little early because they're still trying to get

02:55:00.480 --> 02:55:04.060
music. No, you could do that. I mean, they're looking for artists, but they can do like

02:55:04.060 --> 02:55:08.520
a few songs, at least a song playable demo or something. Maybe, we'll see. I didn't even,

02:55:08.520 --> 02:55:12.720
did Red Octane even have a booth last year? Kentia, I think. Really? Okay, then they'll

02:55:12.720 --> 02:55:15.240
They'll probably have something like that there again, so it should be interesting.

02:55:15.240 --> 02:55:18.240
Kensho Hall, by the way, for those that are unfamiliar with E3, they basically have two

02:55:18.240 --> 02:55:19.240
huge halls.

02:55:19.240 --> 02:55:20.240
What is it?

02:55:20.240 --> 02:55:21.480
West Hall and Main Hall?

02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:22.480
I don't know.

02:55:22.480 --> 02:55:23.480
Main Hall, West.

02:55:23.480 --> 02:55:24.480
Main Hall, West Hall.

02:55:24.480 --> 02:55:29.440
Main Hall is where Xbox was last year and all the other big developers.

02:55:29.440 --> 02:55:35.200
Places like Electronic Arts, who else is in there?

02:55:35.200 --> 02:55:36.200
Engage.

02:55:36.200 --> 02:55:37.200
Engage.

02:55:37.200 --> 02:55:38.200
Konami.

02:55:38.200 --> 02:55:40.200
And the UF Army.

02:55:40.200 --> 02:55:41.920
All those folks are in the Main Hall.

02:55:41.920 --> 02:55:45.400
The West Hall is another huge hall, and that's where Nintendo and Sony were last year, and

02:55:45.400 --> 02:55:47.880
where presumably these guys are going to be again.

02:55:47.880 --> 02:55:51.800
And then some other, like, you know, not quite as big, but pretty big stuff like 1UP.com

02:55:51.800 --> 02:55:55.200
I think was in there, and TechTV, when they were still around, had a booth in there, and

02:55:55.200 --> 02:56:00.040
some of the folks that put out the plug your joystick into the TV thing, they were all

02:56:00.040 --> 02:56:01.040
in there.

02:56:01.040 --> 02:56:02.520
And they shipped Sega and Acclaim into little side rooms.

02:56:02.520 --> 02:56:05.800
And then there's little side rooms, and that's where Sega, Acclaim, Atari, where they all

02:56:05.800 --> 02:56:07.920
were, like rooms along the way.

02:56:07.920 --> 02:56:11.760
And then you have this place called Kensha Hall, and if you don't know where it is, you'll

02:56:11.760 --> 02:56:15.200
miss it it's underneath the main hall you go downstairs and there's this

02:56:15.200 --> 02:56:18.840
other place and that's where they kind of stuck all the Korean games and like

02:56:18.840 --> 02:56:22.520
there was like Korean alley and peripherals and stuff and that's where

02:56:22.520 --> 02:56:25.200
some of the cool stuff oh yeah what's interesting about Kenshi a hall is that

02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:27.560
even though people joke about it and say it's the place where games go to die

02:56:27.560 --> 02:56:31.660
it's one of the more interesting places e3 it's really your hidden gems area

02:56:31.660 --> 02:56:35.780
that's where classic gaming Expo is doing a little preview that's where the

02:56:35.780 --> 02:56:42.720
the X-Tango game was, whatever happened to that? O2 Jam, all that stuff was down there.

02:56:42.720 --> 02:56:46.820
So it'll be interesting to see what Kenshi Hall has this year. Maybe Red Octane, I know

02:56:46.820 --> 02:56:51.580
the competing company, the guy that I talked to from some other company and I don't remember

02:56:51.580 --> 02:56:54.780
who it was. Yeah, whatever just happened with the speakers. Yeah, and then there was the

02:56:54.780 --> 02:56:58.460
guy who said they would send us the speakers to review on the show and we didn't get any.

02:56:58.460 --> 02:57:03.860
Oh well. Bummer. Alright, so of course now that you guys have been asking in chat, will

02:57:03.860 --> 02:57:09.860
Will Orange Lounge be going again? Yes. Will we be taking pictures and putting them on the website? Hell yes. We're going to take tons and tons of pictures.

02:57:09.860 --> 02:57:14.860
I'm getting pictures with booth babes this time. Son of a bitch. I am not being the one holding the camera.

02:57:14.860 --> 02:57:17.860
No, no, no. I have to get the booth babe pictures. It's not fair.

02:57:17.860 --> 02:57:21.860
I will also be armed with a digital camera this year because I am borrowing somebody's.

02:57:21.860 --> 02:57:28.860
Actually, I will be on the hunt for booth hunks this year, but we'll see. I doubt they'd pose with me, but maybe I'll use Dark Sakura.

02:57:28.860 --> 02:57:29.860
Booth boys?

02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:32.860
Booth boys. I'll use Dark Sakura for that.

02:57:32.860 --> 02:57:34.260
I'm like, hey, baby.

02:57:34.260 --> 02:57:36.620
Here, take a picture with my friend.

02:57:36.620 --> 02:57:38.700
Hey, baby.

02:57:38.700 --> 02:57:39.980
So that's going to go on.

02:57:39.980 --> 02:57:40.560
We'll have that.

02:57:40.560 --> 02:57:44.300
We will also be podcasting every day from E3.

02:57:44.300 --> 02:57:45.820
We're still trying to work out the details of how we're going

02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:46.340

02:58:57.860 --> 02:58:59.860
No!

02:58:59.860 --> 02:59:02.860
Now, we only made a radio show for the fun of it, you know?

02:59:02.860 --> 02:59:04.860
Yeah, for the fun- the thrill.

02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:05.860
The thrill of the hunting.

02:59:04.860 --> 02:59:05.860
Rob!

02:59:05.860 --> 02:59:06.860

02:59:08.860 --> 02:59:09.860
W-w-what?

02:59:09.860 --> 02:59:14.860
Ahhh.

02:59:13.860 --> 02:59:14.860
Ahhh.

02:59:14.860 --> 02:59:19.860
Ahhhh.

02:59:16.860 --> 02:59:18.860
Hm hm hm.

02:59:18.860 --> 02:59:27.700
Sorry for the dead air there. I just had to put a little plug in the chat room there.

02:59:27.700 --> 02:59:31.140
Also, we have a club on 1UP.com that nobody ever uses or posts in. So if you're a 1UP.com...

02:59:31.140 --> 02:59:32.140
Do you have a club?

02:59:32.140 --> 02:59:35.020
Yeah, we do. If you have a 1UP.com account, look for the Orange Launch Radio Club. Just

02:59:35.020 --> 02:59:36.140
do a search. We're on there.

02:59:36.140 --> 02:59:40.860
You know, I have a MySpace account and only one person is... Well, two people have friended

02:59:40.860 --> 02:59:45.860
me. One person being you and one person being some chick.

02:59:45.860 --> 02:59:46.860
Wait, what is this? 1UP?

02:59:46.860 --> 02:59:47.860
No, MySpace.

02:59:47.860 --> 02:59:48.860
MySpace.

02:59:48.860 --> 02:59:49.860
Oh, MySpace.

02:59:49.860 --> 02:59:50.860
Oh, okay.

02:59:50.860 --> 02:59:52.780
You know, if I had known I made one, you should...

02:59:52.780 --> 02:59:54.940
My MySpace name is Loki O-L-R.

02:59:54.940 --> 02:59:57.060
Did you put your picture on there?

02:59:57.060 --> 02:59:58.060
No.

02:59:58.060 --> 02:59:59.060
See, that's why.

02:59:59.060 --> 03:00:02.480
Put a picture of you looking metrosexual and you'll have women from everywhere.

03:00:02.480 --> 03:00:05.620
I don't have any metrosexual pictures.

03:00:05.620 --> 03:00:06.620
We can fix that.

03:00:06.620 --> 03:00:11.500
We'll get you a little button-up shirt and, you know, paint your nails or something and,

03:00:11.500 --> 03:00:12.500
you know...

03:00:12.500 --> 03:00:13.500
Yeah, just paint my man.

03:00:13.500 --> 03:00:15.500
Wear what Ander's wearing.

03:00:15.500 --> 03:00:22.840
all right okay whatever huh anyway look if you want to be popular you got to be

03:00:22.840 --> 03:00:31.760
metrosexual because you know homo cell that's what it is and I am almost I can

03:00:31.760 --> 03:00:36.280
say that it's okay okay definitely when we're making gay jokes you know the

03:00:36.280 --> 03:00:39.620
show's over so please put the nail in the coffin of this show let's go around

03:00:39.620 --> 03:00:43.520
and get everybody's final thought we'll start it off with toady your final

03:00:43.520 --> 03:00:48.720
thought? What exactly is this my final thought on? Just, you know, whatever you

03:00:48.720 --> 03:00:51.600
want. Your final, it's like Jerry Springer. At the end of every show he would give

03:00:51.600 --> 03:00:55.680
you his final thoughts. What's your final thought? Okay, I'm eagerly anticipating

03:00:55.680 --> 03:01:02.480
the ITG home version. I hope that Konami doesn't fuck up the new Xtreme 2 like

03:01:02.480 --> 03:01:05.960
they fucked up the other one. I'm pretty sure that's already been covered on

03:01:05.960 --> 03:01:13.960
previous shows. And, yeah, I think that's it. I'm good.

03:01:13.960 --> 03:01:16.960
Alright. Loki, your final thought?

03:01:16.960 --> 03:01:24.600
Work, work, work. I'm hoping to play more Final Fantasy XI this week. God damn it,

03:01:24.600 --> 03:01:29.920
I need to get back in my routine. It's just, you know, the woman wants attention. You know

03:01:29.920 --> 03:01:35.320
how that is. And, I don't know, it's just like, I had to play last night from like,

03:01:35.320 --> 03:01:41.280
you know 10 to 2 a.m. and I started getting tired. You know what else is

03:01:41.280 --> 03:01:46.040
really awesome? Golden grams. And I bet you guys didn't know this if you pour

03:01:46.040 --> 03:01:51.800
enough water into a toilet it will eventually flush itself. Now you know.

03:01:51.800 --> 03:01:57.280
And you know my final thought is you know what else is pretty cool is golden

03:01:57.280 --> 03:02:12.280
I'm going to be doing some gaming this week before going to E3, just because I have to

03:02:12.280 --> 03:02:14.240
get back into the gamer mindset.

03:02:14.240 --> 03:02:21.100
Last night Dan and I on our main machine beat Metal Slug X, they gave us fucking hard, Metal

03:02:21.100 --> 03:02:26.320
Slug X is pretty damn awesome, we got turned into zombies the whole game, it was great,

03:02:26.320 --> 03:02:38.040
And then I plan on doing some PSO tomorrow, Final Fantasy XI on Wednesday, PSO night on

03:02:38.040 --> 03:02:45.640
Friday the 13th, I should be on episode 8, look for me, Dark Sakura, or Cover Girl, or

03:02:45.640 --> 03:02:50.640
I forgot the other two that I have, look for the ID card for Gunstar Hero, because that's

03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.360
actually Dan's name, since we're on the same account.

03:02:54.360 --> 03:02:55.360
And that's it.

03:02:55.360 --> 03:03:01.800
one last very important thing reject false icons unless they're in DDR then

03:03:01.800 --> 03:03:07.900
worship them because you know it's gonna be nothing but false icons reject false

03:03:07.900 --> 03:03:15.800
DDR all right haha oh okay and lastly the final word of the show one word to

03:03:15.800 --> 03:03:19.540
wrap everything up that we've talked about in this show and sum it all up you

03:03:19.540 --> 03:03:22.540
You know I gotta give it to you, our guest, Tody. One word. Final word.

03:03:22.540 --> 03:03:24.540
Oh shit. Put me on the spot here.

03:03:24.540 --> 03:03:25.540
Um...

03:03:25.540 --> 03:03:27.540
That's the idea is to put people on the spot.

03:03:27.540 --> 03:03:29.540
God damn it. I hate it when you do that.

03:03:29.540 --> 03:03:32.540
Alright, uh, metrosexual is gonna be the word.

03:03:32.540 --> 03:03:37.540

Your beads on the wall, my face, my face on TV

03:04:24.540 --> 03:04:27.540
They dissipate the pungent odor of a power holder

03:04:27.540 --> 03:04:29.540
Then kickers come in 60 clips upon the sonar

03:04:29.540 --> 03:04:31.540
They're gonna fold me over like a chopper keeper folder

03:04:31.540 --> 03:04:33.540
If this is D&D you'd see me jumping to a portal

03:04:33.540 --> 03:04:36.540
I'm a geek, spreadsheet double EK

03:04:36.540 --> 03:04:38.540

A card table, comic books, and Ken's a cult

Otherwise known as the motherfucker sucks if it's it

03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:02.940
If I was Wolverine, you'd hear my knuckles go snick

03:05:02.940 --> 03:05:05.540
I'm not perfect, the big four picture of Peter Parker

03:05:05.540 --> 03:05:08.740

Your face on the wall, my face, my face on repeat

03:05:31.740 --> 03:05:33.740
Don't fuck with the geek, just cause he got a gift

03:05:33.740 --> 03:05:36.740
You get my way, bitch, you get a broken egg pinch

03:05:36.740 --> 03:05:41.460
One night I didn't go to sleep, up playin' Riff At dawn, I won, got global dominance

03:05:41.460 --> 03:05:43.860
But in the hallway it's completely different shit

03:05:43.860 --> 03:05:46.260
Can't get my locker open and my pants are always slick

03:05:46.260 --> 03:05:48.740
Can't seem to catch a ride, can't ever get a date

03:05:48.740 --> 03:05:51.300
But in my mind, seven to nine things are great

03:05:51.300 --> 03:05:53.460
Come night fight, prima donna's prevail

03:05:53.460 --> 03:05:55.780
I'm a homo-sittin', lines from the holy grail

03:05:55.780 --> 03:06:00.660
Stuffed nose, exes swollen glands Never been kissed, never been on hands

03:06:00.660 --> 03:06:03.620
Just buck my biscuits over Britney in a bubble bath

03:06:03.620 --> 03:06:05.860
Darth Vader wishin' haters can't follow collabs

03:06:05.860 --> 03:06:08.260
The dragon died from a heart attack

03:06:08.260 --> 03:06:10.580
You may advance and you're up to armor class

03:06:10.580 --> 03:06:12.740
Being a geek, it ain't so bad

03:06:12.740 --> 03:06:15.060
I can't get laid, I got you pandemic-sashed

03:06:15.060 --> 03:06:17.700
In a mind jam-packed with sci-fi facts

03:06:17.700 --> 03:06:19.860
Dread knocks, rock, dynamite kicks, yeah!

03:06:19.860 --> 03:06:21.460
Stop drinking on me

03:06:22.260 --> 03:06:23.860
Because I'm ugly

03:06:24.260 --> 03:06:26.260
Because I'm fake to you

03:06:27.060 --> 03:06:29.060
Because I'm fake to you

03:06:29.460 --> 03:06:31.460
But I wanna be fake

03:06:31.860 --> 03:06:33.860
Because I'm ugly

03:06:33.860 --> 03:06:39.860
My name's on TV!

03:06:50.860 --> 03:06:52.860
Stop picking on me!

03:06:53.360 --> 03:06:54.860
Because I'm ugly!

03:06:55.860 --> 03:06:57.860
I'm straight to you!

03:06:58.360 --> 03:06:59.860
You're straight to me!

03:07:00.860 --> 03:07:02.860
Well what do you think?

03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:07.360
I'm gonna pack him, your face on the wall

03:07:07.860 --> 03:07:11.360
My face, my face on TV

03:07:12.360 --> 03:07:16.860
Because I'm a thief, I'm safe to you

03:07:17.360 --> 03:07:21.860
You're safe to me, well what do you say?

03:07:22.360 --> 03:07:26.360
I'm gonna pack him, your face on the wall

03:07:26.860 --> 03:07:30.360
My face, my face on TV

03:07:30.360 --> 03:07:35.080
