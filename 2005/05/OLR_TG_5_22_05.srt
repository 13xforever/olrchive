00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,640
Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of May 23rd, 2005.

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,600
Welcome to our podcast the orange launch radio to go edition where we talk about games that don't suck

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as sky

4
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,720
Joining me as my co-host Loki. Hello and the other co-host dark Sakura

5
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,720
She is not here tonight because she is coming back from LA the day that we're taping this podcast

6
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,920
She stayed a couple days extra so she could go to Disneyland and stuff. Yeah

7
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:57,280
Yeah, we actually went a couple days early so we could go check out the more friends concert which happened on Monday night

8
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:59,120
What did you think of the More Friends concert, Loki?

9
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,640
It was good, but it was littered with technical issues.

10
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,880
Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing.

11
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:06,600
A lot of sound problems, and I think

12
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,500
whoever was behind arranging the sound and stuff for that show

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,880
is going to get canned.

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,680
And the real too bad part is that it probably

15
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,160
jeopardizes whether that is going

16
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,840
to happen in the future or not.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,960
You know, it's kind of sad.

18
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:21,000
I almost feel like because the audience reception was

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,720
kind of lukewarm to it, and it's too bad

20
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,120
because they did some amazing things at the concert.

21
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:32,320
The opera scene that they did was great, and the Black Mages rocked, and that combination

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,280
at the very end, they played one wing angel combined, the Black Mages and the orchestra

23
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,280
and the choir.

24
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,280
It was amazing.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,280
Exactly.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,920
It's just kind of too bad that because of the sound issues, when I say sound issue,

27
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:48,720
I mean like during like Eris's theme and stuff, when you hear that doo doo doo doo doo doo,

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,960
you hear like these big popping noises and things like that.

29
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,440
Yeah, the sound of stuff exploding.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,120
Oh yeah, the emcee's mic didn't work for some of it and a bunch of other stuff.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
It's just too bad.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,560
It was really sad.

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,500
But I mean, overall, it's nobody, no talent person's fault.

34
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:10,040
The orchestra was great, the singers were great, Uematsu and his band were awesome.

35
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:11,040
Overall it was a good time.

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:16,280
It's just too bad that some bad sound department can really screw up a show like that and kind

37
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,040
of make the whole thing look bad.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,360
Speaking of sound issues, you may notice we're back to our studio sound.

39
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,240
That's because, of course, we are back in the studio.

40
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,080
I actually had a chance to listen to the podcast we recorded, and

41
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,240
I noticed that the sound quality was a lot lower than what you're used to.

42
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:37,440
Do remember, you guys, we were on cheap little $10 microphones and a laptop.

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,480
And now we're back to having our mixing board and our nicer microphones.

44
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,080
So we hope you guys enjoyed our podcast from E3 nonetheless.

45
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,360
We wanna do it again next year, hopefully do some interviews and

46
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,500
things like that as well just as this podcast continues to grow and if you

49
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,620

50
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:08,940
those sites ought to have a record of all the shows we have currently on file

51
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,940
it's pretty cool all right let's talk about our gaming week well obviously we

52
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:17,660
were at e3 most of the week but out of curiosity was there any games that you

53
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:22,620
played that wasn't an E3, something else maybe you played, Loki.

54
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,940
I played a lot of

55
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:29,140
Rengoku Tower of Purgatory, and actually the game kind of grew on me just because I figured

56
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,320
out a way

57
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,620
eh, it's kind of good and bad for the game. This is a PSP game, right? PSP game, it's

58
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,700
a Konami game.

59
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,980
It's kind of very similar to say, oh I want to say like

60
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:44,100
Diablo but not.

61
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:50,260
It kind of reminded me of Diablo, but basically what it is is you're this sort of Android

62
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:55,300
thing and you can attach different parts as you're defeating these other androids.

63
00:03:55,300 --> 00:04:01,420
You can attach their parts to you and you can get like, for example, say you have this

64
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,140
one weapon which is a double cloth.

65
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,660
You attach it to your arm, it's actually like a cloth, you attach it to your head, it's

66
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:09,040
almost like horns or something.

67
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,600
And so I've been going through this game and just kind of basically like leveling up on

68
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,600
each floor.

69
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:22,360
But the problem is I figured out a way to level up so fast that I'm unstoppable now.

70
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:25,800
It's kind of a flaw in the game but it makes it fun at the same time.

71
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:30,120
I don't really know how to describe it but right now I'm really powerful and I figured

72
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,640
out a way to kill everything like super quick and I guess I don't know but I don't really

73
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:37,640
play much of the game.

74
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:45,640
There's not really much depth to it. It's just kind of you go level to level and you rise up this tower and I don't really know what the plotline is.

75
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:52,640
But it's kind of fun attaching all these different weapons to you and you have to think a little bit. It's kind of like armored core in a sense I guess.

76
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:58,640
But I was playing a lot of that in More Ridge Racer for the PSP, and I was kind of trying

77
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:04,040
out some of the newer, I'm on the EX tracks now, and once I pass those I have to get to

78
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:10,280
the pro track, or the, was it max tracks, the max circuits, and those are apparently

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:13,000
impossible to play.

80
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,660
Alright.

81
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:18,720
I guess my week, pretty much I didn't play a whole lot of stuff outside of E3, but I'll

82
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,720
tell you one thing.

83
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:23,940
I took a little piece of E3 home with me one night because I actually used the DS download

84
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:30,460
station to take Meteos back to the hotel and Lankystyle and myself, you might know him

85
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,700
from some of the programs on Orange Launch Radio's live station.

86
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:39,040
We actually played Meteos Versus because we both downloaded it from the DS download station.

87
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,700
We played Versus in the hotel room later on that night.

88
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:44,860
So much fun, it's a great game.

89
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:50,000
I remember back on the podcast I kind of was annoyed with the DS download station the first

90
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,640
day because it was hard to get in there and get anything because it was always crowded,

91
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:56,720
but you know once you got in there and got something it was a pretty neat concept and

92
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,160
being able to put your DS to sleep, I wish I had still slept the damn thing and I could

93
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,480
still have that Meteos demo, but I'll just have to wait until next week when the game

94
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,480
comes out.

95
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:11,480
It's a great puzzler, I'm so happy the DS, honestly the E3 really did restore my faith

96
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:15,000
of the DS I'm so happy because really right now there's not a lot of great

97
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,440
stuff out for it but there's so much good stuff on the horizon I'm very happy

98
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:23,320
and ten dogs needs to be pushed up to say I don't know next week seriously but

99
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:26,840
last date we hear for Nintendo as I think was August 22nd so I'm like

100
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:31,520
anything speaking of e3 let's get into some game news and talk about e3 kind of

101
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,680
the winding down of e3 and everything going on Loki how many people would you

102
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,540
say attended e3 this year and your perception of walking around the show

103
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,820
Way too many.

104
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,620
If you could make a guess.

105
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,620
I would say million bajillion.

106
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,620
No, I don't know.

107
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:54,180
I'd say probably about maybe 100,000.

108
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,180
I don't know.

109
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:59,220
A little high, but 70,000 people attended this year's E3 Expo.

110
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:04,700
To put this into perspective a little bit for you guys, last year's E3 Expo was 58,000.

111
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:09,220
So that was 12,000 more people at E3 this year compared to last year.

112
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:14,220
The Los Angeles Convention Center is 547,000 square feet.

113
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,980
So if you think about putting 70,000 people in that,

114
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:18,900
now granted, they aren't always all there at once,

115
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,340
but still, putting a good number of that in that center,

116
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:24,020
you can kinda see where things get really,

117
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,740
really crowded at E3.

118
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:30,740
400 exhibitors, 5,000 products on display for 70,000 people.

119
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,920
Very interesting, very crowded.

120
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,180
E3's dates for next year have been announced.

121
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,980
It sounds like it's bumping up a little earlier

122
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:41,180
in the month by a week, May 10th through the 12th of 2006.

123
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,060
Yeah, I know.

124
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:43,900
I've already gotten the bad news.

125
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,220
Oh, you're not going to be able to make it?

126
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:47,520
Well, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to make it

127
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,260
because I'm getting married that Sunday before.

128
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:52,540
Well, that would be a good reason why you can't go.

129
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,740
Yeah, I don't think.

130
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm not even going to try pushing it.

131
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:57,500
I mean, that's just bad news.

132
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,660
Well, a very interesting story actually turned up on GameSpot.

133
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,220
You may not be the only one that doesn't get to go next year.

134
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,460
A very interesting article on GameSpot.

135
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:07,140
It's kind of a little bit of an interview

136
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:09,700
with the show director Mary Doelier,

137
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,260
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that there,

138
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,220
talking about some changes that they wanna make

139
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:17,740
to the show, and a lot of the article talks about

140
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,700
should they make the show public?

141
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:23,060
And they don't really wanna make the show public,

142
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,040
even though there have been cries to do that for a long time

143
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:28,240
but trust me guys, it's crowded enough as it is.

144
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,060
And what the director said is, quote,

145
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,180
the biggest headache is trying to keep the consumers

146
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,400
from coming to the show.

147
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,900
Everyone feels that they should come

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:39,660
And there's a number of people that will work at a retail outlet, they'll get a job there

149
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:43,340
and work there for two weeks, and because they have a pay stub, they think that they're

150
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,380
entitled to come.

151
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:48,700
So it's very interesting that the director of E3, and we kind of, on our E3 podcast,

152
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,860
we kind of bitched about that.

153
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:55,820
Some of the people we saw there were from like banks and, you know, stores that have

154
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,820
many departments.

155
00:08:56,820 --> 00:09:00,920
And we know for a fact there were people there that worked in like a lawn and garden department,

156
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:03,600
but were coming for E3 to look at the games.

157
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,700
So the director of the show is kind of aware of what's going on, so it'll be very interesting

158
00:09:06,700 --> 00:09:09,300
to see if there's any changes to next year's show.

159
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:17,360
They did reject their saying 16,000 people this year, so interesting.

160
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:22,040
And of course they're talking about that they will kind of reevaluate things and see what

161
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
they should do.

162
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,460
More credentials, that's all it really comes down to is just maybe instead of asking for

163
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:31,600
one pay stub, maybe ask for the most recent pay stub or something like that, like one

164
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,720
that's only a few weeks old or something.

165
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,800
The final word here in this article from the director.

166
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:42,160
As far as the improvement side, we'll continually watch the registration and try to set policies

167
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,260
and make sure that we're really letting in only the quality people and staff up with

168
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:51,220
more registration people to make sure we keep it to just the people who should be here.

169
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,220
Very interesting.

170
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:56,820
So unfortunately, if you guys are a little bummed that it's kind of hard to go to E3,

171
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,200
it's going to get harder next year.

172
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:02,140
It sucks too because now that you get in but they want like oh well we have some of the

173
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:05,980
consumers coming in let's make it all media only I mean yeah so we kind of

174
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:10,780
complained about earlier so interesting so we'll see what happens with e3 next

175
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:13,980
year of course there won't be any word on next year's e3 outside of the date

176
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,860
until much later on so looking around the internet there's some other stories

177
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,580
that come up as well one thing that was interesting that wasn't at e3 this year

178
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:27,740
was the phantom console now remember that they have like a huge booth last

179
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:28,500
year

180
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,740
at a huge booth showing up the phantom console must be this big thing you

181
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,280
download games online

182
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:37,060
we heard rumors they were going to be there at e3 this year but

183
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:40,340
not the same with me folks vaporware

184
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,300
vaporware

185
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,700
i feel sorry for you exactly put money into this thing article on cnn money

186
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,360
quote the company believes based on past performance that there is a high

187
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,320
likelihood that sufficient capital will not be available and many or all of these milestones

188
00:10:56,320 --> 00:11:01,480
will be missed and the launch date will again shift and or the company will go out of business.

189
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:04,960
There's no market for it anymore because all these new game consoles are coming out.

190
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,120
It's pretty much what it is.

191
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,600
You can download content, you can play games online with your friends.

192
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:10,600
They're just too late.

193
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:16,360
They did not get this console out fast enough and even if they were to try to push it out

194
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,520
now it's going to be a failure.

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:23,320
basically I would say take you know count your losses now and just don't or

196
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:27,400
maybe try to team up your technology with one of the folks that's going into

197
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:30,840
this very soon like placed I although I doubt something like that would happen

198
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:36,960
I suppose you never know so there goes the phantom console not gone forever yet

199
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:41,400
I'd love to take one of those because that'd make really cool case mod but you

200
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:47,840
know I granted they had a really cool the console look cool I mean it's a lot

201
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,640
better than, say, the Revolution, at least the design of it.

202
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:56,720
Speaking of the Revolution, the Revolution was starting to feel like vaporware a little

203
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,680
bit as well as E3 because we didn't see a whole lot on it.

204
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,160
We did get to see some early console designs.

205
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:07,000
They are promising that they will reveal more details about the Revolution by the end of

206
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,600
this year, which makes sense.

207
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,680
They're going to have to, really.

208
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:16,080
One thing that did happen is that the company's Japanese site for Nintendo actually released

209
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:20,200
some new images of the revolution and it actually shows the revolution in some

210
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,120
different colors

211
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,880
including, I'm bringing this picture up in studio right now so look you can see

212
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,680
this, there's actually black

213
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,960
and white and then there's like this pinkish color

214
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:34,440
and this really like barfy yellow color that the revolution is supposed to be coming

215
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:39,220
coming in. Very interesting. That doesn't look like a Nintendo console to me, it looks

216
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:45,380
like a PS2, or it looks like a disc drive, it's so weird. It looks like a micro ITX PC case

217
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,660
And honestly, there are micro-ITX PC cases that look exactly like this.

218
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:50,660
That's the thing.

219
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,660
It's a box.

220
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:53,740
Ooh, it's a box of the glowing CD drive.

221
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,500
Wow, you went out on a limb to make that one.

222
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:59,660
Well, we can knock the system until we get more details.

223
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,060
I'm knocking it right now.

224
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:02,060
It looks ugly.

225
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,980
It's just like you didn't spend any time.

226
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:09,740
Okay, granted the PlayStation 3 isn't much better, but at least it looks sleek and it

227
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,740
looks nice.

228
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,400
Like it's something that you'd want to have in your house because it looks cool.

229
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:18,480
The revolution looks like something I'm going to shove next to my VCR because it's small.

230
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,360
What's interesting is that also what you can notice on the console from these screenshots

231
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:28,240
is you can actually see a flip top that will reveal some GameCube style controller ports

232
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,860
as well as GameCube memory card slots, which makes sense if this is going to be a backwards

233
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:35,120
compatible system.

234
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:38,620
They need to have this somewhere on the system as well.

235
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:42,060
Also the system is supposed to have, of course as we already know, wireless controls and

236
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:46,020
an internal flash memory so this stuff is all kind of extra but there's that

237
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:51,000
flip-top there Loki if you haven't seen that vehicle yeah now see now one little

238
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:54,660
cool thing yeah well that's kind of cool that it's on there still looks like a

239
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,940
box all right so we'll hopefully see a little more on the Nintendo evolution

240
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:03,480
later on but that'll be cool for case body what do you I didn't you have

241
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:06,420
something on Nintendo revolution you want to share oh no it's a couple things

242
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:11,200
first there was an article that came out though saying oh the revolution is going

243
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,620
to be able to run like home brew code on it and everyone's excited, oh yay, home brew

244
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:17,660
code. Then there's another article that came out and said no, you're not going to be able

245
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:20,460
to run home brew code. In fact, there's going to be a new digital rights management thing

246
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:24,180
in place where it'll be impossible for you to run home brew code on it and impossible

247
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:29,880
of course meaning that it will take a little bit more time to run home brew code on it.

248
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,520
It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen honestly. And you know what's funny

249
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:38,380
is last night I was trying to download the full videos for, remember that Revolution

250
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:42,060
thing that was out, you know, with the video and everything.

251
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,140
It's very interesting, that whole video...

252
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,380
The fan video you're talking about?

253
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:46,380
The fan one.

254
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,380
Okay, the fan-made video.

255
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:50,880
Well, it's got that case design, though, in it.

256
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,540
And I don't know when that video came out, I mean, but it's got that same case design

257
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,440
with the other thing.

258
00:14:56,440 --> 00:15:00,940
Because we still haven't seen what the controller looks like for the revolution, so...

259
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:06,760
But anyways, supposedly, you know, but I wanted to get the whole fan video because it looked

260
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:10,600
kind of cool and there's like five different parts but their website was bandwidth exceeded

261
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:16,840
so nope but i'll have that hopefully one of these days you know isn't it weird that every time

262
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,000
somebody goes to e3 and this happened to me last year too it's like there's something you

263
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,880
completely freaking missed at the show and you're like how did i miss this i walked the show floor

264
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:30,200
like four times and i somehow completely missed this well i feel embarrassed that i missed this

265
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:34,600
one but you know what there's so much stuff that goes on at e3 that sometimes you know you just

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,560
missed the most obvious things. There's actually a brand new Mario Brothers game

267
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,080
coming to the DS and I don't mean some Mario franchise, you know, Mario baseball,

268
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:48,160
Mario DDR, whatever. I'm talking a Mario Brothers side-scroll game is coming out

269
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,640
for the DS. I saw that. What did you think of this? I didn't hear you bring

270
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:58,120
this up on the podcast. It looked dumb. Really? How did it look dumb? Because it's Mario... The screenshots I saw

271
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:04,860
look pretty sweet it just it reminded me of like like paper Mario I don't like

272
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,280
paper Mario I've always been bitter with paper Mario because it's not Mario RPG

273
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:16,080
and they want to say it's Mario RPG 2 and it's no but anyways um no it's just

274
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:20,880
I if they're gonna do a new Mario game it's got to be old-school like graphics

275
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:26,000
2d but that's kind of what they're going for is what it looked like I'll see the

276
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:32,240
The other cool thing I thought is if you remember Super Smash Brothers Melee, there's like that

277
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:35,760
stage where you actually kind of play like Mario when you're going through like the adventure

278
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,100
mode or something like that.

279
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,100
That was cool.

280
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,100
That was so cool.

281
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,640
Like they should make an entire like GameCube Mario in that regard, but we'll see.

282
00:16:45,640 --> 00:16:47,420
I guess maybe we're just wishing.

283
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,400
Well, whatever.

284
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:53,840
One big surprise at the show about the Xbox 360, Square Enix is hopping on board because

285
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:59,220
Final Fantasy XI will be released for the Xbox 360. Rumor was that it was going to have

286
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:04,420
graphic upgrades, but apparently those rumors are actually being shot down. They will not

287
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:09,260
have graphic upgrades in it. It's going to be the same thing. But here's the deal. I

288
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:14,120
think this is really what it is, if you think about it. If you play on the PS2, you're playing

289
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,260
in like 640x480 low res mode, but it looks fine on a TV. But if you play that same mode

290
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:24,460
on a computer, it looks a little choppy, but it looks fine on TV. I imagine what they're

291
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:29,640
doing with the Xbox is it's just like playing it on a high-end PC. And when you port that

292
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:34,340
to a television set, it looks really, really clean. So I imagine that's just what it is.

293
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,340
It's just a high-end computer.

294
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:39,740
It's all it is, and it's going to be because it's HDTV compatible, so it's going to be

295
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:46,660
high-end graphics, but it's not going to exceed that of the actual PC version. It's just some

296
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,660
different things.

297
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:51,860
Other questions were answered at a press conference at Square Enix held after the show in regards

298
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,340
to Final Fantasy XI, among with some other Square Enix games.

299
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:01,060
Final Fantasy XI will use the same servers on the Xbox 360 as the PC or PS2.

300
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:04,700
Rumors are going around to the contrary, but they put those to rest.

301
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:07,500
So you will play on the same servers that everyone else plays on.

302
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:13,220
So it'll be, I think, the first game to be a cross-server across three different platforms,

303
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:14,220
I think.

304
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,220
Maybe.

305
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,220
Maybe.

306
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:21,140
Was Fantasy Star Online? But they don't all share the same servers, that's the problem.

307
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:25,900
Yeah, weird, huh? Final Fantasy XII was not playable at E3.

308
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:29,980
They claim it was an issue of timing, but they are saying that they will have it

309
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,740
playable at the end of July

310
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:37,400
in some type of private setting. So I think our rumors that we completely made

311
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,940
up about the fact that it's being pushed for PlayStation 3 are false. It will come

312
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:41,980
out on PS2.

313
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:48,460
But I'll tell you what it looks damn good. I mean honestly the movie we saw inside the

314
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,060
Square Enix theater

315
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:55,500
When you see this thing you you would have a hard time believing its ps2 as well. It looks very good

316
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:03,420
Square Enix will be dubbing Final Fantasy 7 advent children in English when they release it here in America

317
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:10,300
No word yet, if they will do it in Japanese with English subtitles as well like another option on the DVD

318
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:16,740
I'm sure well well the best it well the best answer. They got was a we will consider the possibility. I didn't get a yes

319
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:19,860
hmm

320
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:26,380
World of Mana was a game that was teased at e3, but really no additional information outside of that

321
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:30,900
I remember seeing a trailer for it, but it really didn't show anything just that ooh a new amount of games

322
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:34,060
It's going to come out right yeah, or second. Let's do it for those who appear us

323
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:37,620
No idea what system. It's on or any type

324
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,380
what if it's going to be like when I heard world of mana I thought it was

325
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:47,300
going to be an MMO but no idea yet so basically what they're trying to do is

326
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:52,740
with the world of mana is that they're going to try and release this across

327
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,820
multiple platforms at once when I say multiple platforms I mean they want to

328
00:19:55,820 --> 00:20:01,740
do like films with it novels and manga other things so kind of interesting what

329
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:06,300
they want to do with that so we'll have to see how this game turns out but we

330
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:10,520
You might not only get a world amount of game, but an anime and all sorts of other things

331
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:11,520
as well.

332
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,140
You got some hack stories you wanted to share with us, Loki?

333
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:17,740
Yeah, there's more emulators coming out for the PSP.

334
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:21,340
Let's see, we've got development right now.

335
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:27,680
They've got the ones coming out for the PC Engine, for those who don't remember that.

336
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,660
That's the TurboGrafx-16 in the US.

337
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:35,060
There's Rin, which is the Game Boy Color emulator.

338
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:38,380
Version 1.1.4.1 was released.

339
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:45,260
Still only playable on version 1 PSPs, but however, there is some information saying

340
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:50,140
that they think they may have found a way to get it to work on 1.5s, which are all the

341
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,140
US versions.

342
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:53,460
So you'll have to check that out.

343
00:20:53,460 --> 00:21:02,860
Other things I should mention about the PSP is Gamapack for the Wipeout Pure was released

344
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
this week.

345
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:08,380
I downloaded it, I checked it out, and I didn't care because it was like one track and a couple

346
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,380
new.

347
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:12,740
I've just kind of given up on Wipeout Pure.

348
00:21:12,740 --> 00:21:17,700
I just use it for the browser hacks and it's interesting.

349
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:25,240
Also I forgot to mention I got to play online using the infrastructure mode in the PSP so

350
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:29,360
over the internet I got to play Twisted Metal head on with some other people and that was

351
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,360
pretty interesting.

352
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:35,120
No lag, but people were dropping out of the rooms like crazy so it kind of sucked.

353
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,880
But it's funny enough that people are using Twisted Metal head on more for chat than anything

354
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:42,800
because there's actually like chat rooms.

355
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,120
So I thought that was funny.

356
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:49,000
Speaking of chat on portable gaming systems, one thing we didn't go into too much detail

357
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,280
on our podcast from E3 about was the voice over IP thing that they were showing off at

358
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,280
Nintendo's booth.

359
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,160
Kind of interesting, different, interesting.

360
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:05,720
Speaking of voice over IP stuff, there's actually a guy that was working as actually part of

361
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:18,520
a voice over IP company and he's saying a CEO Eric Lagerway from X10 it's like a VoIP

362
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:24,240
phone company he's trying to get his software to run on a PSP so he's trying to get voice

363
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,080
over IP chat for the PSP.

364
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:29,360
Something new coming to handhelds.

365
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:34,640
Speaking of handhelds one thing that kind of surprised people at the show was the Gizmondo

366
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,780
That was a brand new system coming out from Tiger and what they're trying to do

367
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:41,980
with this, it's already available in Europe but it's going to be coming out here.

368
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:46,460
Not only will it play games but it's supposed to do movies and music

369
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:50,180
and of course you kind of think, well so can my PSP, but then also it does pictures

370
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:51,500
with a built-in camera

371
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:54,540
and you can send it to other Gizmondo users

372
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,260
and other mobile phone users as well. It also has a built-in GPS system in it.

373
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:02,080
Kind of interesting. Bluetooth in it as well.

374
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,980
Did you get a chance to check out the Gizmondo?

375
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:04,980
A little bit.

376
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,220
When I went by the booth, it was so loud over there and I couldn't handle it because they

377
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:13,300
had some, it was kind of enclosed and they had some performance going on over there and

378
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:16,380
it was crowded, so I didn't really get to see too much of the system, but it looked

379
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,380
interesting.

380
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:23,640
I was already more interested in it than I was in, say, the N-Gage, so that's something

381
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,580
good for it right there.

382
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,980
Didn't you check out one of the games?

383
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:30,880
I tried out the one music game that they had there.

384
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:38,600
It was interesting, I don't know, it was kind of, the load time on it was killer, it was

385
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,220
just like, oh my god.

386
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:43,760
Load time was pretty bad, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.

387
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:47,600
Do you think the Gizmondo stands a chance against things like the DS and the PSP?

388
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,600
Maybe?

389
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,840
It definitely stands a chance against, they say, the N-Gage.

390
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:56,080
And I think it's got some pretty good stuff for it, I don't know if it's got a phone capability

391
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,080
with the Gizmondo, but it's got a camera built into it, so that's kind of neat.

392
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,480
The interface wasn't that bad.

393
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:06,960
The game was pretty cool, I just couldn't hear much of it because the sound wasn't working

394
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:12,140
too well because the people were rapping like four feet away from me.

395
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:16,780
But if they fixed the load time issue, I assume that just because it was a demo they had the

396
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:22,480
huge load time because that thing loaded for five minutes and now that's unacceptable.

397
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:27,840
But I assume because it's probably not finished that that's probably the case.

398
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:32,560
But if that's what is going to be the final version, then no, I would not recommend it.

399
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:37,600
But otherwise, it looks like it would be pretty cool.

400
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:41,920
Some little controversies going on at E3 in regards to some of the conferences.

401
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:46,440
It seems like a lot of folks were not impressed with the big three's conferences this year.

402
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:50,280
Microsoft, many claims coming out that they had plants in the audience that would sit

403
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:54,760
there and act all enthusiastically and that the media was kind of just not amused with

404
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
it.

405
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,500
You know, that Microsoft had plants in the audience.

406
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:01,800
One rumor there, PS3 rumor going around that some of their videos that they were claiming

407
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:04,900
were real-time were actually pre-rendered videos.

408
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:06,680
Some of the materials they showed from Killzone 2.

409
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:11,640
Well yeah, because now the PS3's graphics and stuff are so good, it does look like pre-rendered

410
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,360
video, but it's not.

411
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:19,200
They showed, I mean, I was looking at some of the conference stuff that they were showing.

412
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:23,220
There's not, you know, there's no way that they're saying that's pre-rendered video because

413
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:26,740
they're showing like real-time, the guy's moving the stuff around, taking like a model

414
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:29,320
of the one guy who played Dr. Octopus

415
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:32,720
and adjusting the light in the stuff

416
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,860
and they modeled the room and stuff.

417
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,420
There's no way that, I mean,

418
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,260
they're showing live footage of that

419
00:25:39,260 --> 00:25:41,460
and I don't, there's no way.

420
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,000
Oh, that'd be interesting.

421
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,400
And then just an overall general sigh

422
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,760
at Nintendo's conference this year

423
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,400
that really their ace in the hole

424
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,040
is Zelda Twilight Princess and that's about it.

425
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,600
Not a whole lot of details on Revolution

426
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,580
and the Game Boy Micro, not that impressive.

427
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,060
how are you supposed to read text on that thing, huh?

428
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,900
If you want to play a Pokemon game,

429
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:04,380
you gotta get out your binoculars, or your magnifying glass, rather,

430
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:07,120
and try to read some of the text on that thing.

431
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:09,980
You know what's sad is I think they're trying to make...

432
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:10,620
I mean,

433
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:14,500
why aren't they just instead of developing this new Game Boy Advance, which really did

434
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,400
they really needed to do that? They didn't.

435
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,380
The Game Boy Advance SPO is fine, people liked it.

436
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:23,940
I don't see why you need that. Yeah, I'm a little surprised at the micro as well. It was kind of one of those things where I was like,

437
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:26,740
Okay, I'm sure, why not, I guess.

438
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,940
It seems like something, are they trying to design

439
00:26:28,940 --> 00:26:30,820
something that people want to put on their key chains

440
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,380
and stuff, is that what it is?

441
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,380
I think what they're trying to do is they're trying

442
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
to make it a music player too,

443
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,300
because apparently it has a music player add-on to it.

444
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,380
Huh, that would be interesting.

445
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:44,660
But, you know, stop, leave the music business

446
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:46,300
for the people that want to do the music business,

447
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,300
like the iPods and stuff.

448
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,980
Why does, you know, Microsoft and Nintendo

449
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:56,220
and like so many have to try to get in on that music and started as the music

450
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,740
thing is really a revolutionary now we're moving from a cd age to a digital

451
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:02,340
age and everybody wants a piece of it

452
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:06,020
stomped the poor guys they get left in the duster here's a here's a problem is

453
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:08,960
we're a make these console systems that can do everything but

454
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:11,080
gaming

455
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:15,020
that's the problem is there are a lot of plays dvds in a place your ipod the

456
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,260
number of the book

457
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,740
you have a game suck

458
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:18,780
you know

459
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:21,560
or yeah they look pretty but they'd be sock

460
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:22,720
you know it's

461
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:25,180
i'd i'm afraid that's where to run into

462
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:28,680
cuz i can tell you this much i played a few games that he three that look good

463
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,000
but they sucked

464
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:32,000
house that work

465
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:36,200
of it they look pretty but they're just not they're not fun like what they want

466
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,480
l a rush couldn't free nor to play the game you have to actually look at the

467
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,120
map because it's so detailed stuff

468
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,720
there's no indicator we're supposed to go so you have to find your own path to

469
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:47,020
the checkpoint

470
00:27:47,020 --> 00:27:50,980
half the times I get stuck in an alley or something I'm all good I gotta turn around now

471
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:54,680
and you end up in last place because you can't find your way around

472
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:59,700
it's just because there's so much detail oh it looks good but you know what I can't play it

473
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:03,560
it's not fun it's not like you know San Francisco rush where

474
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:07,860
it was in a city but the tracks were laid out you couldn't really deviate from the

475
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,340
tracks that much

476
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:12,860
not that I really cared but I mean there are shortcuts and stuff that's what I was

477
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,300
looking for an LA rush

478
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:17,500
I was expecting it to be just like San Francisco Rush.

479
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:23,060
Better graphics, different city, same type of gameplay because that's what I expected

480
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:27,300
with the Rush series and then they went and changed it up on me to try to make it better

481
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:29,180
and it's not fun.

482
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,580
Alright, well that's the last story I have.

483
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,860
You have anything else?

484
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:35,260
I have nothing.

485
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:39,620
I'm looking more into that Nintendo Revolution video and I couldn't find anything.

486
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:46,580
Well, more E3 Fallout to come on our next podcast and et cetera, et cetera, and we'll

487
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,540
be here with you guys to tell you the latest.

488
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,500
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention also.

489
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:54,940
I bought Smart Bomb and I played it and I cannot recommend that game to anyone.

490
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:59,220
Load times are long, it's frustrating, it makes you want to throw the PSP.

491
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,220
Don't buy it.

492
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,220
All right.

493
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:03,100
That was a little random, but that's all right.

494
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,740
Any other random final thoughts that you might have?

495
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,420
No, that's it.

496
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:14,380
All right, and I guess my final thought would be send us email to go to go at orange lounge radio calm

497
00:29:14,380 --> 00:29:18,960
Or did you know if you want to address one of us specifically you can write Matt at orange launch radio calm

498
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:23,620
Jamie at orange launch radio calm and or myself Rob at orange launch radio calm

499
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:30,420
We were here for you. So but our general show email is to go to geo at orange launch radio calm

500
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:34,860
I don't get email I get spam. I don't know how that works. None of the rest of us get spammed

501
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:41,860
Have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
