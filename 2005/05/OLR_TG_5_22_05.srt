00:00:00,265 --> 00:00:03,387
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 23rd, 2005.

2
00:00:03,547 --> 00:00:14,334
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:18,116
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:20,518 --> 00:00:23,420
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody, again from back home.

5
00:00:24,602 --> 00:00:27,745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nice to be back home, although E3 was pretty exciting.

6
00:00:27,785 --> 00:00:29,606
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice to be back home.

7
00:00:30,427 --> 00:00:34,710
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our podcast, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, where we talk about games that don't suck.

8
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:35,671
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

9
00:00:35,691 --> 00:00:36,572
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

10
00:00:37,192 --> 00:00:39,414
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me is my co-host, Loki.

11
00:00:39,994 --> 00:00:40,415
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

12
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:42,777
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other co-host, DarkSakura.

13
00:00:42,837 --> 00:00:47,781
[SPEAKER_02]: She is not here tonight because she is coming back from LA the day that we're taping this podcast.

14
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:50,343
[SPEAKER_02]: She stayed a couple days extra so she could go to Disneyland and stuff.

15
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:57,387
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually went a couple days early so we could go check out the More Friends concert, which happened on Monday night.

16
00:00:57,427 --> 00:00:59,008
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the More Friends concert, Loki?

17
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:03,570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good, but it was littered with technical issues.

18
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:04,891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing.

19
00:01:04,931 --> 00:01:10,394
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of sound problems, and I think whoever was behind arranging the sound and stuff for that show is going to get canned.

20
00:01:11,195 --> 00:01:16,838
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real too bad part is that it probably jeopardizes whether that is going to happen in the future or not.

21
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:17,978
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

22
00:01:18,179 --> 00:01:18,739
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost feel like

23
00:01:19,519 --> 00:01:22,500
[SPEAKER_02]: because the audience reception was kind of lukewarm to it.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:26,140
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's too bad because they did some amazing things at the concert.

25
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:36,962
[SPEAKER_02]: The opera scene that they did was great, and the Black Mages rocked, and that combination at the very end, they played one wing angel, combined the Black Mages and the orchestra and the choir.

26
00:01:37,362 --> 00:01:38,122
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

27
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:38,862
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

28
00:01:39,162 --> 00:01:44,963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of too bad that because of the sound issues, when I say sound issue, I mean like during like Eris' theme and stuff, when you hear that...

29
00:01:48,649 --> 00:01:50,750
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd hear these big popping noises and things like that.

30
00:01:50,951 --> 00:01:52,572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sound of stuff exploding.

31
00:01:52,852 --> 00:01:56,034
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the MC's mic didn't work for some of it and a bunch of other stuff.

32
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:56,834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too bad.

33
00:01:57,115 --> 00:01:58,235
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really sad.

34
00:01:58,436 --> 00:02:03,379
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, overall, it's nobody, no talent person's fault.

35
00:02:03,499 --> 00:02:04,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The orchestra was great.

36
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,620
[SPEAKER_02]: The singers were great.

37
00:02:06,581 --> 00:02:09,523
[SPEAKER_02]: Uematsu and his band were awesome.

38
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:10,884
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, it was a good time.

39
00:02:10,904 --> 00:02:17,828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too bad that some bad sound department can really screw up a show like that and kind of make the whole thing look bad.

40
00:02:19,029 --> 00:02:20,310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

41
00:02:36,142 --> 00:03:05,179

00:03:05,826 --> 00:03:09,049
[SPEAKER_02]: A record of all the shows we have currently on file.

43
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:09,770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

44
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,831
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about our gaming week.

45
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:14,734
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously, we were at E3 most of the week.

46
00:03:14,834 --> 00:03:19,498
[SPEAKER_02]: But out of curiosity, was there any games that you played that wasn't at E3?

47
00:03:19,578 --> 00:03:21,380
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else maybe you played, Loki.

48
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:27,005
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Rengoku Tower Purgatory.

49
00:03:27,025 --> 00:03:29,587
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the game kind of grew on me just because I figured out a way...

50
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,234
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of good and bad for the game.

51
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:03,068
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you have this one weapon, which is a double claw.

52
00:04:03,088 --> 00:04:08,173
[SPEAKER_01]: If you attach it to your arm, it's actually like a claw if you attach it to your head, it's almost like horns or something.

53
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:21,324
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I've been going through this game and just, you know, kind of basically like leveling up on each floor, but the problem is I figured out a way to level up so fast that I'm unstoppable now.

54
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:25,808
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's kind of a flaw in the game, but it makes it fun at the same time.

55
00:04:25,928 --> 00:04:27,450
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know how to describe it, but...

56
00:04:28,363 --> 00:04:37,410
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm really powerful and I figured a way to kill everything like super quick and I guess, I don't know, but I don't really play much of the game.

57
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:39,592
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really much depth to it.

58
00:04:39,672 --> 00:04:43,015
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of you go level to level and you rise up this tower.

59
00:04:43,815 --> 00:04:49,880
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what the plot line is, but it's kind of fun and attaching all these different weapons to you and you have to think a little bit.

60
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:52,182
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like Armored Core in a sense, I guess.

61
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:56,966
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was playing a lot of that and more Ridge Racer for the PSP and I was...

62
00:04:58,066 --> 00:04:58,686
[SPEAKER_01]: DX Download Station

63
00:05:24,865 --> 00:05:26,706
[SPEAKER_02]: to take Meteos back to the hotel.

64
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:38,731
[SPEAKER_02]: And LankyStyle and myself, you might know him from some of the programs on Orange Launch Radio's live station, we actually played Meteos Versus because we both downloaded it from the DS download station.

65
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,072
[SPEAKER_02]: We played Versus in the hotel room later on that night.

66
00:05:41,602 --> 00:05:42,363
[SPEAKER_02]: So much fun.

67
00:05:42,923 --> 00:05:43,604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great game.

68
00:05:45,105 --> 00:05:53,072
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back on the podcast, I kind of was annoyed with the DS download station the first day because it was hard to get in there and get anything because it was always crowded.

69
00:05:53,493 --> 00:05:56,615
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, once you got in there and got something, it was a pretty neat concept.

70
00:05:56,656 --> 00:06:02,781
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to put your DS to sleep, I wish I had still slept the damn thing and I could still have that Meteos demo, but.

71
00:06:03,151 --> 00:06:04,872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to wait until next week when the game comes out.

72
00:06:05,432 --> 00:06:06,392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great puzzler.

73
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:12,075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy the DS... Honestly, the E3 really did restore my faith in the DS.

74
00:06:12,235 --> 00:06:17,357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy because really right now, there's not a lot of great stuff out for it, but there's so much good stuff on the horizon.

75
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy.

76
00:06:18,057 --> 00:06:22,219
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs needs to be pushed up to say, I don't know, next week.

77
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,340
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, but the last date we hear from Nintendogs I think was August 22nd.

78
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,121
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

79
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:28,084
[SPEAKER_02]: E3, E3, E3, E3

80
00:06:53,129 --> 00:06:54,649
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 100,000, I don't know.

81
00:06:55,089 --> 00:06:59,291
[SPEAKER_02]: A little high, but 70,000 people attended this year's E3 Expo.

82
00:06:59,311 --> 00:07:03,312
[SPEAKER_02]: To put this into perspective a little bit for you guys, last year's E3 Expo was 58,000.

83
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:08,554
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was 12,000 more people at E3 this year compared to last year.

84
00:07:09,374 --> 00:07:14,175
[SPEAKER_02]: The Los Angeles Convention Center is 547,000 square feet.

85
00:07:14,996 --> 00:07:19,277
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about putting 70,000 people in that, now granted they aren't always all there at once, but still,

86
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:19,739
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 May 10-12, 2016

87
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:45,041
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're not going to be able to make it?

88
00:07:45,321 --> 00:07:50,205
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to make it because I'm getting married that Sunday before.

89
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:52,607
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would be a good reason why you can't go.

90
00:07:52,627 --> 00:07:55,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think... I'm not even going to try pushing it.

91
00:07:55,288 --> 00:07:57,410
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just bad news.

92
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:00,632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a very interesting story actually turned up on GameSpot.

93
00:08:00,672 --> 00:08:03,174
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not be the only one that doesn't get to go next year.

94
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,996
[SPEAKER_02]: A very interesting article on GameSpot.

95
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:09,539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a little bit of an interview with the show director, Mary Dolier.

96
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:10,900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if I mispronounced that there.

97
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:11,540
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

98
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:15,602
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about some changes that they want to make to the show.

99
00:08:15,642 --> 00:08:19,483
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the article talks about should they make the show public.

100
00:08:19,803 --> 00:08:24,964
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't really want to make the show public, even though there have been cries to do that for a long time.

101
00:08:24,984 --> 00:08:26,805
[SPEAKER_02]: But trust me, guys, it's crowded enough as it is.

102
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:34,006
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the director said is, quote, the biggest headache is trying to keep the consumers from coming to the show.

103
00:08:34,446 --> 00:08:35,807
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone feels that they should come.

104
00:08:35,827 --> 00:08:38,487
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a number of people that will work at a retail outlet.

105
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:41,208
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get a job there and work there for two weeks and

106
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:41,768
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

107
00:09:03,567 --> 00:09:08,811
[SPEAKER_02]: So the director of the show is kind of aware of what's going on, so it'll be very interesting to see if there's any changes to next year's show.

108
00:09:09,292 --> 00:09:14,776
[SPEAKER_02]: They did reject their saying 16,000 people this year, so interesting.

109
00:09:17,318 --> 00:09:22,643
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they're talking about that they will kind of re-evaluate things and see what they should do.

110
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,625
[SPEAKER_01]: More credentials, that's all it really comes down to is just, you know,

111
00:09:26,095 --> 00:09:33,879
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe instead of asking for one paste, maybe ask for the most recent paste or something like that, like one that's only a few weeks old or something.

112
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:50,167
[SPEAKER_02]: The final word here in this article from the director, as far as the improvement side, we'll continually watch the registration and try to set policies and make sure that we're really letting in only the quality people and staff up with more registration people to make sure we keep it to just the people who should be here.

113
00:09:51,148 --> 00:09:51,688
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

114
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,203
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, if you guys are a little bummed that it's kind of hard to go to E3, it's going to get harder next year.

115
00:09:58,223 --> 00:10:04,527
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sucks, too, because now that you get in, but they want, like, oh, well, we have some of the consumers coming in, let's make it all media only.

116
00:10:04,767 --> 00:10:08,850
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Yeah, so we kind of complained about it earlier, so... Interesting.

117
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,932
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens with E3 next year.

118
00:10:10,972 --> 00:10:15,875
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there won't be any word on next year's E3 outside of the date until much later on.

119
00:10:16,676 --> 00:10:19,857
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking around the internet, there's some other stories that come up as well.

120
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:24,878
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that was interesting that wasn't at E3 this year was the Phantom Console.

121
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,999
[SPEAKER_02]: Now remember that they had a huge booth last year?

122
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,600
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a huge booth showing off the Phantom Console, and it was supposed to be this big thing.

123
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,960
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download games online.

124
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,441
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard rumors they were going to be there at E3 this year, but nope, nothing.

125
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:38,581
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it with me, folks.

126
00:10:38,801 --> 00:10:39,261
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporware.

127
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:39,682
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporware.

128
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:41,322
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaporware.

129
00:10:42,335 --> 00:10:43,259
[SPEAKER_02]: An article on CNNMoney.com

130
00:10:48,330 --> 00:11:01,321
[SPEAKER_02]: The company believes, based on past performance, that there is a high likelihood that sufficient capital will not be available and many or all of these milestones will be missed and the launch date will again shift and or the company will go out of business.

131
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:04,444
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no market for it anymore because all these new game consoles are coming out.

132
00:11:04,884 --> 00:11:05,705
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much what it is.

133
00:11:06,085 --> 00:11:08,988
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download content, you can play games online with your friends.

134
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:10,349
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just too late.

135
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:14,132
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not get this console out fast enough and...

136
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,589
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they were to try to push it out now, it's going to be a failure.

137
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:23,592
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say count your losses now and just don't release it.

138
00:11:23,612 --> 00:11:28,155
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe try to team up your technology with one of the folks that's going into this very soon.

139
00:11:28,535 --> 00:11:31,057
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I doubt something like that would happen.

140
00:11:31,377 --> 00:11:32,137
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose you never know.

141
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,339
[SPEAKER_02]: So there goes the Phantom console.

142
00:11:35,719 --> 00:11:37,020
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gone forever yet.

143
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to take one of those because that would make a really cool case mod.

144
00:11:40,762 --> 00:11:41,623
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know...

145
00:11:42,754 --> 00:11:46,683
[SPEAKER_01]: I granted they had a really cool the console look cool I mean

146
00:11:47,532 --> 00:11:50,273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better than, say, the Revolution.

147
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,093
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the design of it.

148
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:59,235
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Revolution, the Revolution was starting to feel like vaporware a little bit as well as E3 because we didn't see a whole lot on it.

149
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:01,535
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get to see some early console designs.

150
00:12:02,135 --> 00:12:08,497
[SPEAKER_02]: They are promising that they will reveal more details about the Revolution by the end of this year, which makes sense.

151
00:12:08,517 --> 00:12:09,517
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to, really.

152
00:12:10,617 --> 00:12:14,658
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that did happen is that the company's Japanese site for Nintendo...

153
00:12:15,118 --> 00:12:36,285
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually released some new images of the revolution and it actually shows the revolution in some different colors Including, I'm bringing this picture up in studio right now so look you can see this There's actually black and white and then there's like this pinkish color And this really like barfy yellow color that the revolution is supposed to be coming in Very interesting, hmm?

154
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,968
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't look like a Nintendo console to me.

155
00:12:39,009 --> 00:12:40,029
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a PS2.

156
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,611
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a disk drive.

157
00:12:41,671 --> 00:12:42,411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so weird.

158
00:12:42,572 --> 00:12:45,414
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a micro ITX PC case.

159
00:12:45,534 --> 00:12:48,016
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, there are micro ITX PC cases.

160
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,058
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.

161
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,279
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a box.

162
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, it's a box with a glowing CD drive.

163
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:56,183
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you went out on a limb to make that one.

164
00:12:56,463 --> 00:12:59,686
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can't knock the system until we get more details.

165
00:12:59,706 --> 00:13:00,827
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm knocking it right now.

166
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:02,028
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks ugly.

167
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,750
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like you didn't...

168
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:04,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend any time.

169
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:10,256
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, granted the PlayStation 3 isn't much better, but at least it looks sleek and it looks nice.

170
00:13:10,356 --> 00:13:12,979
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's something you'd want to have in your house because it looks cool.

171
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:17,383
[SPEAKER_01]: The Revolution looks like something I'm going to shove next to my VCR because it's small.

172
00:13:18,348 --> 00:13:34,802
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting is that also what you can notice on the console from these screenshots is you can actually see a flip top that will reveal some GameCube style controller ports as well as GameCube memory card slots, which makes sense if this is going to be a backwards compatible system.

173
00:13:35,082 --> 00:13:37,284
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have this somewhere on the system as well.

174
00:13:38,445 --> 00:13:43,529
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the system is supposed to have, of course, as we already know, wireless controls and an internal flash memory.

175
00:13:43,905 --> 00:13:48,610
[SPEAKER_02]: So this stuff is all kind of extra, but there's that flip top there, Loki, if you haven't seen that yet.

176
00:13:48,630 --> 00:13:49,431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

177
00:13:49,491 --> 00:13:49,832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

178
00:13:49,872 --> 00:13:51,454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, now one little cool thing.

179
00:13:51,934 --> 00:13:52,275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

180
00:13:52,595 --> 00:13:54,097
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of cool that it's on there.

181
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:55,138
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks like a box.

182
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:57,701
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

183
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:00,344
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll hopefully see a little more on the Nintendo Revolution later on.

184
00:14:00,404 --> 00:14:02,166
[SPEAKER_02]: But that'll be cool for case spotting.

185
00:14:03,085 --> 00:14:04,926
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you have something on Nintendo Revolution you wanted to share?

186
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:05,646
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

187
00:14:05,826 --> 00:14:06,527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple things.

188
00:14:06,687 --> 00:14:12,930
[SPEAKER_01]: First, there was an article that came out that was saying, oh, the Revolution's going to be able to run homebrew code on it.

189
00:14:12,970 --> 00:14:13,670
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's excited.

190
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:14,891
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yay, homebrew code.

191
00:14:15,251 --> 00:14:18,432
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another article that came out that said, no, you're not going to be able to run homebrew code.

192
00:14:18,452 --> 00:14:23,555
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's going to be a new digital rights management thing in place where it'll be impossible for you to run homebrew code.

193
00:14:23,635 --> 00:14:28,057
[SPEAKER_01]: And impossible, of course, meaning that it will take a little bit more time to run homebrew code on it.

194
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:32,388
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen, honestly.

195
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:33,729
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what's funny?

196
00:14:33,909 --> 00:14:41,173
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night I was trying to download the full videos for... Remember that Revolution thing that was out with the video and everything?

197
00:14:41,994 --> 00:14:44,035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting, that whole video.

198
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:45,336
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan video you're talking about?

199
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:45,716
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan one.

200
00:14:45,756 --> 00:14:46,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the fan-made video.

201
00:14:46,777 --> 00:14:50,679
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got that case design, though, in it.

202
00:14:50,859 --> 00:14:55,602
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know when that video came out, but it's got that same case design with the other thing.

203
00:14:56,288 --> 00:14:56,829
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

204
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:30,438
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody goes to E3 and this happened to me last year too it's like there's something you completely freaking missed at the show and you're like how did I miss this I walked the show floor like four times and I somehow completely missed this well I feel embarrassed that I missed this one

205
00:15:30,933 --> 00:15:31,393
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

206
00:15:31,413 --> 00:15:35,955
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much stuff that goes on at E3 that sometimes, you know, you just miss the most obvious things.

207
00:15:36,315 --> 00:15:38,315
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a brand new Mario Bros.

208
00:15:38,375 --> 00:15:44,177
[SPEAKER_02]: game coming to the DS, and I don't mean some Mario franchise, you know, Mario Baseball, Mario DDR, whatever.

209
00:15:44,257 --> 00:15:46,278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking a Mario Bros.

210
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:48,799
[SPEAKER_02]: side-scroll game is coming out for the DS.

211
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:49,759
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.

212
00:15:50,299 --> 00:15:50,959
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of this?

213
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,480
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear you bring this up on the podcast.

214
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,060
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked dumb.

215
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:53,880
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

216
00:15:54,901 --> 00:15:55,761
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it look dumb?

217
00:15:56,101 --> 00:15:58,782
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's Mario... The screenshots I saw looked pretty sweet.

218
00:15:59,878 --> 00:16:04,482
[SPEAKER_01]: It just reminded me of like Paper Mario.

219
00:16:04,522 --> 00:16:05,603
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like Paper Mario.

220
00:16:06,764 --> 00:16:13,849
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been bitter with Paper Mario because it's not Mario RPG and they want to say it's Mario RPG 2 and it's... No.

221
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:22,056
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, no, it's just... If they're going to do a new Mario game, it's got to be old school like graphics, 2D, that type of thing.

222
00:16:22,076 --> 00:16:24,978
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of what they're going for is what it looked like.

223
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:25,839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see.

224
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,922
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other cool thing I thought is have you like...

225
00:16:29,969 --> 00:16:31,350
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember Super Smash Bros.

226
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,592
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee, there's like that stage where you actually kind of play like Mario when you're going through like the adventure mode or something like that.

227
00:16:36,972 --> 00:16:37,812
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

228
00:16:38,032 --> 00:16:38,753
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so cool.

229
00:16:39,053 --> 00:16:44,135
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they should make an entire like GameCube Mario in that regard, but we'll see.

230
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:46,861
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe we're just wishing.

231
00:16:47,321 --> 00:16:49,002
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

232
00:16:49,362 --> 00:16:57,587
[SPEAKER_02]: One big surprise at the show about the Xbox 360, Square Enix is hopping on board because Final Fantasy XI will be released for the Xbox 360.

233
00:16:57,968 --> 00:17:03,151
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor was that it was going to have graphic upgrades, but apparently those rumors are actually being shot down.

234
00:17:03,171 --> 00:17:05,953
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not have graphic upgrades in it.

235
00:17:05,993 --> 00:17:07,113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the same thing.

236
00:17:07,514 --> 00:17:08,514
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the deal.

237
00:17:08,754 --> 00:17:11,356
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really what it is, if you think about it.

238
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:15,815
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play on the PS2, you're playing in like 640x480 low-res mode.

239
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:19,237
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks fine on a TV.

240
00:17:19,297 --> 00:17:21,758
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you play that same mode on a computer, it looks a little choppy.

241
00:17:22,278 --> 00:17:23,219
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks fine on TV.

242
00:17:23,639 --> 00:17:27,440
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine what they're doing with the Xbox is it's just like playing it on a high-end PC.

243
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:32,701
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you port that to a television set, it looks really, really clean.

244
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:34,382
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine that's just what it is.

245
00:17:34,422 --> 00:17:35,222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a high-end computer.

246
00:17:35,282 --> 00:17:35,882
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all it is.

247
00:17:35,902 --> 00:17:39,123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be because it's HDTV compatible.

248
00:17:39,203 --> 00:17:40,703
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be high-end graphics.

249
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:45,104
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to exceed that of the actual PC version.

250
00:17:45,164 --> 00:17:47,085
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some difference.

251
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:54,826
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other questions were answered at a press conference that Square Enix held after the show in regards to Final Fantasy XI, among with some other Square Enix games.

252
00:17:55,206 --> 00:18:00,630
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI will use the same servers on the Xbox 360 as the PC or PS2.

253
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,772
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors are going around to the contrary, but they put those to rest.

254
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:07,454
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will play on the same servers that everyone else plays on.

255
00:18:07,495 --> 00:18:13,679
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be, I think, the first game to be cross-server across three different platforms, I think.

256
00:18:14,239 --> 00:18:14,539
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

257
00:18:14,599 --> 00:18:14,879
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

258
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,262
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII was not playable at E3.

259
00:18:17,282 --> 00:18:23,871
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim it was an issue of timing, but they are saying they will have it playable at the end of July in some type of private setting.

260
00:18:35,259 --> 00:18:40,543
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think our rumors that we completely made up about the fact that it's being pushed for PlayStation 3 are false.

261
00:18:40,623 --> 00:18:41,885
[SPEAKER_02]: It will come out on PS2.

262
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:45,768
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you what, it looks damn good.

263
00:18:45,868 --> 00:18:55,035
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, the movie we saw inside the Square Enix Theater, when you see this thing, you would have a hard time believing it's PS2 as well.

264
00:18:55,055 --> 00:18:55,716
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very good.

265
00:18:58,079 --> 00:19:03,481
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix will be dubbing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children in English when they release it here in America.

266
00:19:04,921 --> 00:19:10,423
[SPEAKER_02]: No word yet if they will do it in Japanese with English subtitles as well, like another option on the DVD.

267
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:11,743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it will be.

268
00:19:11,963 --> 00:19:15,664
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the best answer they got was a we will consider the possibility.

269
00:19:16,084 --> 00:19:16,904
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get a yes.

270
00:19:18,105 --> 00:19:18,365
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

271
00:19:18,665 --> 00:19:18,845
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

272
00:19:20,549 --> 00:19:26,453
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Mana was a game that was teased at E3, but really no additional information outside of that.

273
00:19:26,493 --> 00:19:29,195
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing a trailer for it, but it really didn't show anything.

274
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:31,917
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that, ooh, a new Mana game is going to come out, right?

275
00:19:32,197 --> 00:19:32,377
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

276
00:19:32,497 --> 00:19:34,919
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Seiken Densetsu, for those of you purists.

277
00:19:35,639 --> 00:19:38,701
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea what system it's on or if it's going to be.

278
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:42,944
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard World of Mana, I thought it was going to be an MMO, but no idea yet.

279
00:19:42,964 --> 00:19:43,665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

280
00:19:45,214 --> 00:19:54,038
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what they're trying to do with the World of Mana is that they're going to try and release this across multiple platforms at once.

281
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:59,341
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say multiple platforms, I mean they want to do films with it, novels, manga, other things.

282
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:02,623
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of interesting what they want to do with that.

283
00:20:02,823 --> 00:20:04,584
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to see how this game turns out.

284
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:10,907
[SPEAKER_02]: But we might not only get a World of Mana game, but an anime and all sorts of other things as well.

285
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:12,528
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Color Emulator

286
00:20:34,797 --> 00:21:02,488
[SPEAKER_01]: version 1.141 was released still only playable on version 1 PSPs but however there is some information saying that they think they might have found a way to get it to work on 1.5s which are all the US versions so you'll have to check that out other things I should mention about the PSP is Gamma Pack for the was it Wipeout Pure was released

287
00:21:02,892 --> 00:21:05,953
[SPEAKER_01]: This week I downloaded it, I checked it out, and I didn't care.

288
00:21:06,093 --> 00:21:12,594
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was like one track and a couple new... I've just kind of given up on Wipeout Pure.

289
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:14,775
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use it for the browser hacks.

290
00:21:16,395 --> 00:21:17,116
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.

291
00:21:17,556 --> 00:21:25,138
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I forgot to mention, I got to play online using the infrastructure mode in the PSP.

292
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:29,039
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the internet, I got to play Twisted Metal head-on with some other people.

293
00:21:29,119 --> 00:21:30,179
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty interesting.

294
00:21:30,219 --> 00:21:30,659
[SPEAKER_01]: No lag.

295
00:21:31,175 --> 00:21:58,936
[SPEAKER_01]: but people were dropping out of the rooms like crazy so it kind of sucked but it's funny enough that people are using Twisted Metal head-on more for chat than anything because there's actually like chat rooms so I thought that was funny speaking of chat on portable gaming systems one thing we didn't go into too much detail on our podcast from E3 about was the voice over IP thing that they were showing off at Nintendo's booth kind of interesting different interesting speaking of voice over IP stuff um

296
00:21:59,887 --> 00:22:07,250
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a guy that was working as actually part of a voice over IP company.

297
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:22,857
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's saying, CEO Eric Lagerwey from X10, it's like a VoIP phone company, he's trying to get his software to run on a PSP.

298
00:22:23,197 --> 00:22:25,998
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's trying to get voice over IP chat for the PSP.

299
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, something new coming to handhelds.

300
00:22:29,292 --> 00:22:34,134
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of handhelds, one thing that kind of surprised people at the show was the Gizmondo.

301
00:22:35,055 --> 00:22:37,336
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a brand new system coming out from Tiger.

302
00:22:37,996 --> 00:22:41,738
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're trying to do with this, it's already available in Europe, but it's going to be coming out here.

303
00:22:42,699 --> 00:22:46,120
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only will it play games, but it's supposed to do movies and music.

304
00:22:46,581 --> 00:22:48,542
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you kind of think, well so can my PSP.

305
00:22:48,602 --> 00:22:51,223
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also it does pictures with a built-in camera.

306
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:56,417
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can send it to other Gizmondo users and other mobile phone users as well.

307
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,858
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has a built-in GPS system in it.

308
00:22:59,298 --> 00:23:00,058
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

309
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:01,379
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluetooth in it as well.

310
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,819
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a chance to check out the Gizmondo?

311
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:04,700
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

312
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:13,882
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went by the booth, it was so loud over there and I couldn't handle it because it was kind of enclosed and they had some performance going on over there and it was crowded.

313
00:23:14,264 --> 00:23:17,007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't really get to see too much of the system, but it looked interesting.

314
00:23:17,348 --> 00:23:20,612
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already more interested in it than I was in, say, The Engage.

315
00:23:21,092 --> 00:23:24,736
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something good for it right there.

316
00:23:25,477 --> 00:23:26,719
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you check out one of the games?

317
00:23:26,779 --> 00:23:29,722
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried out the one music game that they had there.

318
00:23:30,864 --> 00:23:31,665
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.

319
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:33,507
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

320
00:23:33,527 --> 00:23:34,188
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of...

321
00:23:36,209 --> 00:23:38,230
[SPEAKER_01]: The load time on it was killer.

322
00:23:38,411 --> 00:23:40,072
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, oh my god.

323
00:23:40,092 --> 00:23:43,194
[SPEAKER_02]: The load time was pretty bad, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.

324
00:23:43,734 --> 00:23:46,856
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the Gizmondo stands a chance against things like the DS and the PSP?

325
00:23:47,337 --> 00:23:47,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

326
00:23:48,077 --> 00:23:50,699
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely stands a chance against, they say, the N-Gage.

327
00:23:51,707 --> 00:23:54,389
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's got some pretty good stuff for it.

328
00:23:54,469 --> 00:23:59,152
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's got phone capability with the games, Mondo, but it's got a camera built into it, so that's kind of neat.

329
00:23:59,893 --> 00:24:01,434
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interface wasn't that bad.

330
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:03,635
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was pretty cool.

331
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:10,360
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't hear much of it because the sound wasn't working too well because the people were rapping like four feet away from me.

332
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:19,431
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they fix the load time issue, I assume that just because it was a demo, they have a huge load time, because that thing loaded for a good five minutes.

333
00:24:20,872 --> 00:24:22,212
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unacceptable.

334
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:32,376
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume, because it's probably not finished, that's probably the case, but if that's what is going to be the final version, then no, I would not recommend it.

335
00:24:32,416 --> 00:24:34,857
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, it looks like it would be pretty cool.

336
00:24:37,492 --> 00:24:41,836
[SPEAKER_02]: Some little controversies going on at E3 in regards to some of the conferences.

337
00:24:41,896 --> 00:24:45,319
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a lot of folks were not impressed with the big three's conferences this year.

338
00:24:45,719 --> 00:24:56,869
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, many claims coming out that they had plants in the audience that would sit there and act all enthusiastically and that the media was kind of just not amused with it, you know, that Microsoft had plants in the audience.

339
00:24:57,469 --> 00:24:58,130
[SPEAKER_02]: One rumor there.

340
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:04,035
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3 rumor going around that some of their videos that they were claiming were real-time were actually pre-rendered videos.

341
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,442
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the materials they showed from Killzone 2.

342
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:14,111
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because now the PS3's graphics and stuff are so good, it does look like pre-rendered video, but it's not.

343
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:19,638
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed, I mean, I was looking at some of the conference stuff that they were showing, there's not

344
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:34,710
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no way that they're saying that's pre-rendered video, because they're showing, like, real-time, the guys moving the stuff around, taking, like, a model of the one guy who played Dr. Octopus, and adjusting the light and stuff, and they modeled the room and stuff, and

345
00:25:35,902 --> 00:25:36,803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.

346
00:25:37,423 --> 00:25:41,105
[SPEAKER_01]: They're showing live footage of that, and there's no way.

347
00:25:42,106 --> 00:25:42,426
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

348
00:25:43,046 --> 00:25:50,231
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just an overall general sigh at Nintendo's conference this year that really their ace in the hole is Zelda Twilight Princess, and that's about it.

349
00:25:51,171 --> 00:25:53,833
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of details on Revolution and the Game Boy Micro.

350
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:55,354
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that impressive.

351
00:25:55,374 --> 00:25:57,255
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you supposed to read text on that thing, huh?

352
00:25:58,135 --> 00:26:01,998
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play a Pokemon game, you've got to get out your magnifying glass, rather.

353
00:26:04,403 --> 00:26:05,944
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to read some of the text on that thing.

354
00:26:26,956 --> 00:26:31,197
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like something... Are they trying to design something that people want to put on their keychains and stuff?

355
00:26:31,257 --> 00:26:32,197
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?

356
00:26:32,477 --> 00:26:36,758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to make another... They're trying to make it a music player, too.

357
00:26:37,098 --> 00:26:39,098
[SPEAKER_01]: Because apparently it has a music player add-on to it.

358
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:40,299
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be interesting.

359
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,119
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know... Stop!

360
00:26:43,499 --> 00:26:47,600
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the music business for the people that want to do the music business, like the iPods and stuff.

361
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:51,441
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does, you know, Microsoft and Nintendo...

362
00:26:52,085 --> 00:26:54,787
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sony have to try to get in on that music.

363
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:55,347
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.

364
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:57,629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because the music thing is truly a revolution right now.

365
00:26:57,669 --> 00:27:01,191
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving from a CD age to a digital age and everybody wants a piece of it.

366
00:27:02,112 --> 00:27:02,772
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dumb.

367
00:27:02,832 --> 00:27:04,733
[SPEAKER_02]: The poor guys get left in the dust.

368
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,974
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem.

369
00:27:06,014 --> 00:27:09,596
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make these console systems that can do everything but gaming.

370
00:27:11,117 --> 00:27:11,778
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

371
00:27:12,178 --> 00:27:14,860
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but it plays DVDs and it plays your iPod.

372
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:17,322
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the games suck.

373
00:27:17,942 --> 00:27:20,844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they look pretty, but they suck.

374
00:27:22,018 --> 00:27:24,599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid that's what we're going to run into.

375
00:27:24,619 --> 00:27:29,661
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can tell you this much, I've played a few games at E3 that looked good, but they sucked.

376
00:27:31,041 --> 00:27:31,781
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that work?

377
00:27:32,081 --> 00:27:34,982
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they look pretty, but they're just not fun.

378
00:27:35,262 --> 00:27:35,642
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what?

379
00:27:35,722 --> 00:27:36,103
[SPEAKER_01]: Name one.

380
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:36,483
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.

381
00:27:36,543 --> 00:27:36,803
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

382
00:27:36,923 --> 00:27:41,644
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to play that game, you have to actually look at the map because it's so detailed and stuff.

383
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:46,466
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no indicator where you're supposed to go, so you kind of have to find your own path through the checkpoints.

384
00:27:46,486 --> 00:27:46,606
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

385
00:27:47,173 --> 00:27:48,114
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

386
00:28:15,655 --> 00:28:16,195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fun.

387
00:28:16,215 --> 00:28:18,536
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well that's the last story I have.

388
00:28:18,576 --> 00:28:20,316
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything else?

389
00:28:34,199 --> 00:28:35,219
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing.

390
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,181
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking more into that Nintendo Revolution video and I couldn't find anything.

391
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:39,641
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

392
00:28:39,701 --> 00:28:43,642
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, more E3 Fallout to come on our next podcast and et cetera, et cetera.

393
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:48,344
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be here with you guys until later.

394
00:28:48,544 --> 00:28:48,904
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

395
00:28:48,944 --> 00:28:54,706
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to mention also I bought Smart Bomb and I played it and I cannot recommend that game to anyone.

396
00:28:54,726 --> 00:28:55,827
[SPEAKER_01]: The load times are long.

397
00:28:56,207 --> 00:28:57,087
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating.

398
00:28:57,107 --> 00:28:58,328
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you want to throw the PSP.

399
00:28:59,068 --> 00:28:59,508
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy it.

400
00:29:00,148 --> 00:29:00,408
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

401
00:29:00,589 --> 00:29:01,329
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little random.

402
00:29:01,349 --> 00:29:01,809
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

403
00:29:03,012 --> 00:29:05,133
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other random final thoughts that you might have?

404
00:29:06,254 --> 00:29:06,894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.

405
00:29:07,855 --> 00:29:14,438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and I guess my final thought would be send us email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

406
00:29:14,558 --> 00:29:23,683
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you know if you want to address one of us specifically, you can write Matt at orangeloungeradio.com, Jamie at orangeloungeradio.com, or myself, Rob at orangeloungeradio.com.

407
00:29:24,283 --> 00:29:25,544
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here for you.

408
00:29:26,904 --> 00:29:30,386
[SPEAKER_02]: But our general show email is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

409
00:29:30,925 --> 00:29:33,466
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

410
00:29:33,486 --> 00:29:35,788
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com

411
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,017
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update!
