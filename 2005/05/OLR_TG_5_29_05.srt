00:00:00,169 --> 00:00:02,831
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 30th, 2005.

2
00:00:02,931 --> 00:00:14,101
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

3
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:17,824
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

4
00:00:19,673 --> 00:00:24,476
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, once again, everybody, and a happy Memorial Day week to you guys.

5
00:00:25,196 --> 00:00:27,017
[SPEAKER_00]: Hope you had fun with your three-day weekend.

6
00:00:27,417 --> 00:00:30,739
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you guys downloading this on Monday, maybe you're still enjoying that three-day weekend.

7
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,582
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us not forget the veterans that gave us this day and fought for our country.

8
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:38,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't forget the masses of the retail.

9
00:00:40,464 --> 00:00:42,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Those who have to work on Memorial Day.

10
00:00:42,625 --> 00:00:43,646
[SPEAKER_00]: That too, that too.

11
00:00:44,206 --> 00:00:48,909
[SPEAKER_00]: The voice you hear back there is my lovely co-host, Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

12
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,164
[SPEAKER_03]: Yo, yo, yo.

13
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:15,341
[SPEAKER_00]: No Skype in here, because Skype cuts out too much for us, so we can't do the Skype thing.

14
00:01:15,381 --> 00:01:17,422
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're not like, you know, from yesterday.

15
00:01:17,482 --> 00:01:18,863
[SPEAKER_03]: We were freshly purchased today.

16
00:01:20,063 --> 00:01:20,743
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.

17
00:01:21,103 --> 00:01:21,703
[SPEAKER_00]: Big thank you.

18
00:01:21,804 --> 00:01:31,487
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting off the show tonight, before we get into any games whatsoever, big, big thank you to iPotter.org and the one and only Adam Curry for, I guess, noticing us this week.

19
00:01:31,507 --> 00:01:31,987
[SPEAKER_03]: Best hair.

20
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:32,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.

21
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:33,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I agreed.

22
00:01:34,631 --> 00:01:36,692
[SPEAKER_00]: When I think of the 80s, I will always think of that hair.

23
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:42,917
[SPEAKER_00]: But seriously, we got noticed on iPodder.org this week, which is really weird because we didn't submit anything over there.

24
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:46,780
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if one of our fans did it or what, but we just showed up on there suddenly.

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:54,026
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually I'm pretty good about submitting our show to like, you know, Podcast Alley, Podcast Pickle, Podcast This, Podcast That, whatever shows up.

26
00:01:54,046 --> 00:01:55,507
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a Podcast Pickle?

27
00:01:55,527 --> 00:01:56,447
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, believe it or not.

28
00:01:56,768 --> 00:01:56,888
[SPEAKER_00]: It's...

29
00:01:57,646 --> 00:01:58,687
[SPEAKER_00]: They got podcast everything.

30
00:01:58,747 --> 00:01:59,287
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the new thing.

31
00:01:59,387 --> 00:02:08,393
[SPEAKER_03]: They should do like from Jay and Silent Bob, podcastpoopshoot.com Somebody is probably registering it as we speak.

32
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:16,558
[SPEAKER_00]: But regardless, for whatever reason, we never got submitted to iPodder.org until this week, and it was huge for our traffic.

33
00:02:16,638 --> 00:02:18,339
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome to all our new subscribers.

34
00:02:18,799 --> 00:02:21,161
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a quick FYI, what we are, what we do.

35
00:02:21,881 --> 00:02:24,463
[SPEAKER_00]: Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for like three years.

36
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:26,284
[SPEAKER_00]: We've only been podcasting since January.

37
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:42,744
[SPEAKER_00]: Internet radio station that runs live 24 hours a day, 7 days a week Dedicated to rhythm and music gaming But this is part of our expansion into other video games We want to talk about other games and other gamings And video games that don't suck And news that you guys really want to know about So that's what we're all about

38
00:02:43,144 --> 00:03:05,796
[SPEAKER_00]: and we just want to produce for you guys like a 30-40 minute show something long enough for you guys to listen to while you're commuting just to keep you up on all the news and all that stuff so and sometimes we like to argue and bicker back and forth and we do sometimes we do some things shut up we do bitch we do some things that are outside of games sometimes as well like Dark Sakura's advice column which we'll get to a little later exactly but first off

39
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:06,877
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

40
00:03:21,338 --> 00:03:21,678
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up?

41
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:22,539
[SPEAKER_00]: How was your gaming week?

42
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:27,663
[SPEAKER_03]: I played PSO Blueburst for like four hours yesterday.

43
00:03:28,404 --> 00:03:30,625
[SPEAKER_03]: I quit Final Fantasy XI yesterday.

44
00:03:30,726 --> 00:03:33,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I quit Final Fantasy XI finally as well.

45
00:03:33,288 --> 00:03:37,731
[SPEAKER_03]: And the clouds parted and the angels came down and sang and it was pretty groovy.

46
00:03:39,232 --> 00:03:41,294
[SPEAKER_03]: And I played some Silent Hill 3.

47
00:03:41,714 --> 00:03:42,715
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm close to the end.

48
00:03:43,413 --> 00:03:45,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in the hospital right now.

49
00:03:45,915 --> 00:03:46,496
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, very cool.

50
00:03:46,956 --> 00:03:47,396
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what, though?

51
00:03:47,437 --> 00:03:49,839
[SPEAKER_00]: You know you're addicted to MMOs, though, seriously.

52
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:53,442
[SPEAKER_00]: When you quit Final Fantasy XI and then freaking sign up for Guild Wars.

53
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:55,864
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, did I really accomplish anything?

54
00:03:56,224 --> 00:03:58,926
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you really accomplish anything going from Final Fantasy XI to Blue Burst?

55
00:03:59,067 --> 00:04:06,233
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but with Blue Burst, it's windowed and I can do other crap while my little femoral is... femoral is...

56
00:04:07,926 --> 00:04:12,850
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really see it as necessarily leaving one game for another.

57
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:17,232
[SPEAKER_00]: I just kind of see it as, I'm bored with this toy and I want a new toy now.

58
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:22,316
[SPEAKER_03]: I've always gone back to PSO, but when Ragnarok 2 comes out, oh, you better watch.

59
00:04:22,336 --> 00:04:24,177
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what is this, the fourth time on PSO?

60
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:28,520
[SPEAKER_00]: You got Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, now PC.

61
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:34,604
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Dreamcast one pissed me off because it wouldn't work with the broadband converter they had.

62
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:42,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't own a Dreamcast until years later when they were like $50 and I only bought it so I could emulate Nintendo games on it.

63
00:04:42,345 --> 00:04:47,506
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I discovered that Soul Calibur is really cool and I kind of went back and rediscovered all these Dreamcast games.

64
00:04:47,927 --> 00:04:51,228
[SPEAKER_03]: Soul Calibur is all about playing that game with the damn fishing rod.

65
00:04:52,088 --> 00:04:53,749
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the fishing rod is analog.

66
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,930
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you sling it, it hits buttons.

67
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:58,710
[SPEAKER_03]: The triggers inside are buttons.

68
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,832
[SPEAKER_03]: So Rod Calibur is the most fun ever.

69
00:05:02,292 --> 00:05:02,512
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.

70
00:05:03,459 --> 00:05:03,900
[SPEAKER_00]: Step on the Cat

71
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:24,797
[SPEAKER_00]: She likes it.

72
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:25,658
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a Flash game?

73
00:05:26,018 --> 00:05:26,659
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.

74
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,321
[SPEAKER_03]: It's when Shermie is on the floor.

75
00:05:28,341 --> 00:05:30,343
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that going to be an Xbox 360 launch title?

76
00:05:30,423 --> 00:05:31,244
[SPEAKER_03]: And you step on her.

77
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:32,165
[SPEAKER_03]: Not very hard.

78
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:37,891
[SPEAKER_03]: And she just flattens herself like this big ball of cat fat and looks up and goes, meow.

79
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:39,393
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, you can go.

80
00:05:39,793 --> 00:05:39,973
[SPEAKER_03]: Meow.

81
00:05:40,053 --> 00:05:40,754
[SPEAKER_03]: And she scatters off.

82
00:05:42,227 --> 00:05:44,129
[SPEAKER_03]: Step on the Cat, her favorite thing.

83
00:05:44,809 --> 00:05:46,190
[SPEAKER_01]: Loki, what games have you been playing?

84
00:05:48,011 --> 00:05:52,214
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I've played Final Fantasy XI because you old people suck.

85
00:05:52,494 --> 00:05:53,695
[SPEAKER_01]: Addict, addict.

86
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:56,657
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, well at least I'm not leaving for another MMO, okay?

87
00:05:57,017 --> 00:05:58,558
[SPEAKER_01]: At least he's low.

88
00:05:58,578 --> 00:06:00,639
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if that's better or worse, but anyways.

89
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:06,223
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I have my character who's level 58 now, finally, and I bought new armor.

90
00:06:06,977 --> 00:06:08,178
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll play FFXI for food

91
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:38,535
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no no, we'll give head for Final Fantasy, I don't know.

92
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,417
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, let it finish.

93
00:06:40,878 --> 00:06:41,598
[SPEAKER_01]: We got news to get to.

94
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:47,084
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so I play Final Fantasy, I play a little bit of my cell phone game, Worms.

95
00:06:47,104 --> 00:06:48,285
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you remember that game, Worms?

96
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:50,988
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it doesn't really transition well over to the cell phone.

97
00:06:51,008 --> 00:06:52,830
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of games don't, FYI.

98
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:58,156
[SPEAKER_01]: For some reason, they just get pissed off that I'm kicking their ass, and they just...

99
00:06:58,766 --> 00:06:59,787
[SPEAKER_01]: They just commit suicide.

100
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:02,768
[SPEAKER_01]: They just walk right off the screen into the water and die.

101
00:07:02,788 --> 00:07:05,830
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, what the hell kind of AI is that?

102
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:11,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, mobile games now is all about the retro factor.

103
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:13,794
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's like Bejeweled on your phone.

104
00:07:14,655 --> 00:07:16,736
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, whoa, $5 for this piece of crap.

105
00:07:16,756 --> 00:07:17,376
[SPEAKER_01]: Yay.

106
00:07:17,576 --> 00:07:18,717
[SPEAKER_01]: Bejeweled came on my phone.

107
00:07:18,737 --> 00:07:22,819
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I played that, and that's pretty much it.

108
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,840
[SPEAKER_01]: Really haven't played much as far as games this week.

109
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:25,633
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

110
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:33,080
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself, I actually picked up a copy of Fable because Fable was running on sale, $30.

111
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,963
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one of those Xbox games where everybody was like, dude, if you have an Xbox, you have to have Fable.

112
00:07:37,163 --> 00:07:37,664
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have it.

113
00:07:37,984 --> 00:07:39,666
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's like the one RPG.

114
00:07:40,737 --> 00:07:42,979
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if you hang around in the town too long they chase you off

115
00:08:07,043 --> 00:08:12,792
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on if you're good or bad, but you can completely play the game as a good guy or you can completely play as a bad guy.

116
00:08:13,192 --> 00:08:16,617
[SPEAKER_00]: So you kind of forge your own path, which is kind of neat.

117
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:21,965
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can have the people refer to you as Arseface because you get to choose your own title later on.

118
00:08:22,705 --> 00:08:26,007
[SPEAKER_01]: And your character changes in appearance depending on whether you're good or bad.

119
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:29,769
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have your arm cut off, they call you stubby or something.

120
00:08:29,969 --> 00:08:31,370
[SPEAKER_00]: Graphics, pretty nice.

121
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:35,012
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only problem I noticed with Fable is that sometimes it's a little bit skippy.

122
00:08:35,592 --> 00:08:37,093
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of like has some loading skips.

123
00:08:37,593 --> 00:08:40,975
[SPEAKER_00]: Awful long loading times in between areas though for such small areas.

124
00:08:41,575 --> 00:08:46,318
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm kind of nitpicking a little bit though because honestly, the cutscene graphics are really great.

125
00:08:47,218 --> 00:08:50,620
[SPEAKER_00]: I really am impressed with the graphics mostly, but just the little skips were a little bit annoying.

126
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,702
[SPEAKER_00]: The sound is awesome, the sound in the game.

127
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:59,045
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got its own original score, I think, that was done by Danny Elfman, at least one of the songs, but the rest of the music really fits into that.

128
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,168
[SPEAKER_00]: The only problem I had with the sound, though, is that sometimes it was overbearing.

129
00:09:04,248 --> 00:09:10,412
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, for instance, this one scene, I'm trying to get trained on magic, and I can't even hear the guy talking because all I can hear is the waterfall behind me.

130
00:09:10,973 --> 00:09:14,294
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the sound kind of gets annoying sometimes, but the score is really great.

131
00:09:14,354 --> 00:09:16,534
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, they could release the score as a CD and probably sell it.

132
00:09:17,254 --> 00:09:18,995
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, I think the game's kind of fun.

133
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:20,875
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a lot of fun stuff going for it.

134
00:09:21,535 --> 00:09:27,017
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd probably give it, like, I don't know, like, I'd give it an above-average score, like a 3 out of 5 stars.

135
00:09:28,157 --> 00:09:28,937
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet, though.

136
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:30,477
[SPEAKER_00]: I still gotta really play a little more with it.

137
00:09:30,497 --> 00:09:33,298
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only, like, two hours into it, so the verdict's still out, but I'm having fun with it.

138
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,698
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I did get a new game.

139
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:35,399
[SPEAKER_00]: What'd you get?

140
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,859
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Dan bought me Technic Beat.

141
00:09:37,559 --> 00:09:38,039
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what'd you think?

142
00:09:38,259 --> 00:09:39,020
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played it yet.

143
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,081
[SPEAKER_03]: I watched you play and I'm like, oh, Technic Beat.

144
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:43,601
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about it next week then.

145
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,242
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still sitting on my desk.

146
00:09:46,703 --> 00:09:52,045
[SPEAKER_01]: For those just tuning in, I give Smart Bomb a 1 out of 5 because it sucks ass.

147
00:09:52,185 --> 00:09:52,805
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that?

148
00:09:53,125 --> 00:10:00,908
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, first off, the game has such long loading times and the puzzles are fucking hard and it makes you want to actually throw your PSP.

149
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:01,648
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura.com

150
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:18,890
[SPEAKER_00]: DarkSakura

151
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:37,740
[SPEAKER_01]: and X-Button, I believe.

152
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,642
[SPEAKER_01]: And you play it basically vertically.

153
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:48,730
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's also another game called Star Soldier, which is going to be coming out, which is also played that way, just like the old school vertical shooter games.

154
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:50,291
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Star Soldier.

155
00:10:50,331 --> 00:10:52,373
[SPEAKER_03]: Wasn't that a Sega CD game?

156
00:10:52,914 --> 00:10:53,294
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

157
00:10:53,314 --> 00:10:53,935
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea.

158
00:10:53,955 --> 00:10:53,995
[SPEAKER_00]: No...

159
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,652
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game.

160
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:58,753
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, no, I'm thinking TurboGrafxDuo.

161
00:10:58,773 --> 00:11:00,114
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a game called Star Soldier.

162
00:11:00,134 --> 00:11:01,575
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, maybe this is it.

163
00:11:03,056 --> 00:11:04,957
[SPEAKER_00]: Hudson did a lot of games for TurboGrafx, didn't they?

164
00:11:05,177 --> 00:11:23,010
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and they did a parody version called Star Parodia, which you could play as Twinby, or you could play as Bomberman, because Hudson also did Bomberman, or you could play as a flying PC engine.

165
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:26,719
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think the idea of the PSP on its side is cute.

166
00:11:26,879 --> 00:11:27,339
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why.

167
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,060
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's not innovative.

168
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,021
[SPEAKER_03]: Bandai already did that with the WonderSwan.

169
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,743
[SPEAKER_00]: But how many people in America played the WonderSwan?

170
00:11:35,063 --> 00:11:35,824
[SPEAKER_00]: You and who else?

171
00:11:36,923 --> 00:11:37,483
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

172
00:11:54,508 --> 00:11:57,570
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not a new idea, but it's something a lot of people haven't seen.

173
00:11:57,930 --> 00:11:58,190
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

174
00:11:58,330 --> 00:11:58,630
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted.

175
00:11:59,130 --> 00:11:59,391
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

176
00:12:00,031 --> 00:12:02,352
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, let's move on to some actual gaming news.

177
00:12:03,292 --> 00:12:15,219
[SPEAKER_00]: Following up from E3, you guys remember when we went to the Final Fantasy concert, that guy who was emceeing, he's a voice actor in the game, and he said that he would be at E3 that Wednesday, because he was the voice of Tidus in the game.

178
00:12:15,799 --> 00:12:19,281
[SPEAKER_00]: I never saw him there, but of course I wasn't hanging out at the Square Enix booth the whole time.

179
00:12:19,761 --> 00:12:21,882
[SPEAKER_00]: But I remember whispering to Loker, I said, I

180
00:12:22,062 --> 00:12:24,844
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have missed it, but again, the E3 is so packed and crowded, I don't know.

181
00:12:49,179 --> 00:12:57,242
[SPEAKER_00]: The Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists are trying to negotiate a new agreement with game publishers regarding voice acting.

182
00:12:57,622 --> 00:13:03,844
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what it comes down to is that right now voice actors are paid a one-time fee up front for their services.

183
00:13:04,656 --> 00:13:05,856
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, no, no.

184
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:10,258
[SPEAKER_00]: Voice actors want some type of payment based on the successes of the game.

185
00:13:10,318 --> 00:13:11,378
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, residuals.

186
00:13:11,698 --> 00:13:14,039
[SPEAKER_00]: If the game sells so many copies, we want a cut of it.

187
00:13:14,059 --> 00:13:14,699
[SPEAKER_03]: They want royalties.

188
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,600
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, basically.

189
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,320
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?

190
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that sound fair?

191
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:19,141
[SPEAKER_03]: They're entitled.

192
00:13:19,901 --> 00:13:25,003
[SPEAKER_03]: It's their talent being lent to the, you know, it happens to regular stage actors.

193
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:32,374
[SPEAKER_03]: They still make money off, you know, like, I was watching some special about Greece, and they still get a regular check.

194
00:13:33,175 --> 00:13:33,415
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

195
00:13:33,776 --> 00:13:35,698
[SPEAKER_03]: For any money that the movie still makes.

196
00:13:36,793 --> 00:13:39,014
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only like a dollar or so, but they still get it.

197
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:40,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Still something.

198
00:13:40,175 --> 00:13:42,456
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the same should apply to the voice actors.

199
00:13:42,896 --> 00:13:55,721
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, what about the flip side of this, where a lot of folks say, and I tend to think about this a little bit too, whereas you have the voice actors in movie-based games, where the game just isn't the same without the original voice actor.

200
00:13:55,761 --> 00:13:57,762
[SPEAKER_00]: Take, for instance, I don't know, Buffy in the Buffy game.

201
00:13:58,183 --> 00:13:59,463
[SPEAKER_00]: She wasn't in it.

202
00:13:59,623 --> 00:14:01,104
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't Sarah Michelle Gellar, right?

203
00:14:01,204 --> 00:14:02,464
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, but everybody else was there.

204
00:14:02,544 --> 00:14:03,245
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that kind of...

205
00:14:03,965 --> 00:14:06,887
[SPEAKER_00]: Did that one voice not being right kind of detract from the game?

206
00:14:07,067 --> 00:14:07,528
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.

207
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:08,509
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, I don't know.

208
00:14:08,549 --> 00:14:09,790
[SPEAKER_00]: She sounded just like her.

209
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:11,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let me think of a better example.

210
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:14,913
[SPEAKER_00]: Say you were trying to replace Marlon Brando in the upcoming Godfather game.

211
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,275
[SPEAKER_00]: That just wouldn't be the same, right?

212
00:14:16,295 --> 00:14:17,195
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, maybe.

213
00:14:17,235 --> 00:14:18,096
[SPEAKER_01]: It's debatable.

214
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:18,636
[SPEAKER_01]: Not necessarily.

215
00:14:18,756 --> 00:14:24,681
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's an example, kind of an old example, but Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, it was not Harrison Ford doing Indiana Jones voice, still fair.

216
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:25,381
[SPEAKER_01]: Felt fine to me.

217
00:14:47,691 --> 00:14:50,313
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, is that an option?

218
00:14:50,373 --> 00:14:52,135
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they really break the union thing?

219
00:14:52,175 --> 00:14:59,321
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to set themselves up for a real... I think what it comes down to is they need to actually be negotiating their contract a little bit better.

220
00:15:00,142 --> 00:15:00,982
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it comes down to.

221
00:15:01,223 --> 00:15:03,665
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to get paid by royalties, don't take the job then.

222
00:15:03,745 --> 00:15:05,706
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, then let me kind of rephrase my question this way.

223
00:15:05,806 --> 00:15:07,948
[SPEAKER_00]: How important is voice acting in a game to you?

224
00:15:08,529 --> 00:15:12,212
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty important since a lot of the games are reliant on that to go along with the visual.

225
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:14,565
[SPEAKER_03]: Night Trap 3 points out of 100

226
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,788
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how much I care about it.

227
00:15:40,108 --> 00:15:40,869
[SPEAKER_01]: It really doesn't matter.

228
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:42,829
[SPEAKER_03]: Good voice acting, to me, can make or break a game.

229
00:15:43,049 --> 00:15:47,630
[SPEAKER_00]: I think voice acting can make a good game better, but I don't think it can save a game.

230
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,011
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a crappy game is still a crappy game.

231
00:15:50,071 --> 00:15:55,012
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have the guy who does all the movie trailers, who has the sexiest voice in the world.

232
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:55,992
[SPEAKER_03]: Or Mr. Movie Phone.

233
00:15:56,672 --> 00:15:57,472
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the Movie Phone guy.

234
00:15:57,512 --> 00:15:59,673
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have either of them in the game, and if the game sucks, the game sucks.

235
00:16:00,613 --> 00:16:06,374
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, though, especially, though, for games that are ported over from Japanese games where they redid all the voices...

236
00:16:07,455 --> 00:16:08,256
[SPEAKER_03]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

237
00:16:36,153 --> 00:16:37,694
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do we have to fight all the time, guys?

238
00:16:38,174 --> 00:16:39,155
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't we all just get along?

239
00:16:39,695 --> 00:16:40,196
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a hug?

240
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:41,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, Rob, that doesn't work.

241
00:16:41,516 --> 00:16:42,037
[SPEAKER_00]: How about a hug?

242
00:16:42,477 --> 00:16:45,919
[SPEAKER_00]: Can't the voice actors in the gaming publishing companies just hug?

243
00:16:49,001 --> 00:16:50,502
[SPEAKER_00]: Xbox 360's on the way.

244
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,503
[SPEAKER_00]: $300 is the rumored price point.

245
00:16:54,124 --> 00:16:57,786
[SPEAKER_00]: I always thought 360 would probably be what they'd charge for it.

246
00:16:57,826 --> 00:17:00,047
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, ha ha ha, get it, Xbox 360, 360.

247
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:02,529
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still saying that that's a possibility.

248
00:17:03,297 --> 00:17:06,998
[SPEAKER_00]: But the $300 is kind of the target price point for the new system.

249
00:17:07,399 --> 00:17:10,280
[SPEAKER_00]: So based on what you saw at E3, is this worth $300?

250
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:10,620
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck yes.

251
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,840
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

252
00:17:13,141 --> 00:17:14,021
[SPEAKER_03]: It was brilliant.

253
00:17:14,361 --> 00:17:14,681
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?

254
00:17:14,941 --> 00:17:15,141
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.

255
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:17,342
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid $300 for my PlayStation 2.

256
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:18,603
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well.

257
00:17:19,043 --> 00:17:20,643
[SPEAKER_03]: I paid $400 for my JPS 2.

258
00:17:20,823 --> 00:17:22,704
[SPEAKER_00]: Allow me to be the first to say no.

259
00:17:23,004 --> 00:17:24,325
[SPEAKER_00]: I will wait for the first price cut.

260
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:30,267
[SPEAKER_00]: I am more... I'm not really sold on any of the launch titles yet.

261
00:17:31,107 --> 00:17:36,051
[SPEAKER_00]: My opinion could change, but there is nothing on the Xbox that's making me go, I have to have this system when it launches.

262
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:37,532
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I want the system?

263
00:17:37,652 --> 00:17:38,773
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, eventually.

264
00:17:38,813 --> 00:17:39,254
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait, wait, wait.

265
00:17:40,134 --> 00:17:41,415
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's what's selling it for me.

266
00:17:41,636 --> 00:17:41,936
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright.

267
00:17:42,136 --> 00:17:42,336
[SPEAKER_01]: What?

268
00:17:42,496 --> 00:17:43,477
[SPEAKER_01]: DOA Volleyball 2.

269
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,680
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's not announced, but it's coming.

270
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:49,542
[SPEAKER_01]: It will be good.

271
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:51,003
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to DOA 4.

272
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,465
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually looking forward to Quake 4.

273
00:17:53,985 --> 00:17:54,586
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty cool.

274
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,548
[SPEAKER_00]: Half-Life 2 is on it.

275
00:17:57,668 --> 00:17:58,989
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honestly more excited about PS3.

276
00:17:59,915 --> 00:18:00,215
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.

277
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,358
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like I want to save my money and get a PS3.

278
00:18:02,438 --> 00:18:03,920
[SPEAKER_03]: I did also go to the PS3 demo.

279
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:06,323
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know I'm going to have them both, so it doesn't matter.

280
00:18:06,423 --> 00:18:15,393
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, when it gets down to about the Xbox 360 time, we'll already have the game room at my work and we'll have a 360 there, so I really don't need to buy one.

281
00:18:15,513 --> 00:18:17,256
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what I'll bet they'll do.

282
00:18:17,476 --> 00:18:18,998
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet you anything this is what happens.

283
00:18:19,318 --> 00:18:20,019
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I could be wrong.

284
00:18:21,343 --> 00:18:22,843
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll sell the system for like $300.

285
00:18:23,344 --> 00:18:25,004
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do like a bare bones thing for $300.

286
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:38,028
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy the 360, they'll do some kind of cheap little time where it's like, you know, the 360 pack or something that'll go for $360 and it comes with a game and like Xbox Live for so many months or something, you know, additional.

287
00:18:38,048 --> 00:18:40,008
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with a game.

288
00:18:40,048 --> 00:18:41,409
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with another controller.

289
00:18:41,449 --> 00:18:42,029
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll come with...

290
00:18:42,509 --> 00:18:44,791
[SPEAKER_01]: Brand new game skins!

291
00:18:45,011 --> 00:18:45,831
[SPEAKER_01]: Woo!

292
00:18:45,851 --> 00:18:47,252
[SPEAKER_01]: That new power button thing.

293
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:53,137
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that they are being smart with how they're combating the PS3 release because they're going to be doing Halo 3.

294
00:18:54,117 --> 00:18:54,938
[SPEAKER_03]: That is smart.

295
00:18:55,238 --> 00:18:56,259
[SPEAKER_03]: That is very smart.

296
00:18:56,399 --> 00:18:59,401
[SPEAKER_00]: It is, but I think the hardcore gamers are not going to be affected.

297
00:18:59,441 --> 00:19:01,462
[SPEAKER_03]: I did stay in line, though, for both demos.

298
00:19:03,104 --> 00:19:04,605
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have to say, though, that...

299
00:19:05,569 --> 00:19:13,454
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the Xbox 360, I'm really looking forward to a lot, because not only is it a system, but it's also a multimedia docking station.

300
00:19:13,574 --> 00:19:16,116
[SPEAKER_03]: And they even showed a picture of a PSP hooking up to it.

301
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything, basically, that's USB firewire is going to hook up to it.

302
00:19:19,778 --> 00:19:20,299
[SPEAKER_03]: And that...

303
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:26,664
[SPEAKER_03]: All it's going to be is just, oh look, I can download my MP3s that I bought on Xbox Live to my PC.

304
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:52,262
[SPEAKER_00]: My MP3 player, which I think you're right where it's going to an entertainment system, not just gaming.

305
00:19:53,431 --> 00:20:01,537
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also showing this one about designing your own shirts on there, having them shipped out as a t-shirt and you can sell them through the Xbox system.

306
00:20:01,557 --> 00:20:02,237
[SPEAKER_03]: They had it on there.

307
00:20:02,477 --> 00:20:09,122
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they going to be crappy like a certain nameless site which does a lot of shirt printing for people and then the shirts wash out after they're washed?

308
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:09,602
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

309
00:20:09,662 --> 00:20:10,683
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't say anything about that.

310
00:20:10,863 --> 00:20:19,368
[SPEAKER_03]: It was saying though that you can market your art, you can show your designs, you can share, you can create a community real-time chat.

311
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:22,490
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you know, last time I checked I thought that's what the internet was for.

312
00:20:23,771 --> 00:20:28,835
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I have to pay $300 for this console that I can do on the internet for free?

313
00:20:29,735 --> 00:20:31,256
[SPEAKER_01]: No, sorry, I'm not going to do that.

314
00:20:31,676 --> 00:20:32,397
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't give a crap.

315
00:20:32,557 --> 00:20:34,678
[SPEAKER_01]: A gaming console is a gaming console is a gaming console.

316
00:20:34,718 --> 00:20:36,640
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a multimedia device.

317
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,981
[SPEAKER_01]: If I wanted a multimedia device, I'd buy a media PC.

318
00:20:39,081 --> 00:20:41,122
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wait, no, I'm not going to touch that either because they're expensive.

319
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,463
[SPEAKER_03]: How about a big whatever to all of that?

320
00:20:42,864 --> 00:20:45,445
[SPEAKER_03]: A system is only good as the games that are on it.

321
00:20:46,186 --> 00:20:46,646
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

322
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:52,630
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, though, I was more impressed with the PS3 demo and I really don't want to be a hoarder Sony, but

323
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:53,394
[SPEAKER_03]: What?

324
00:20:53,414 --> 00:20:53,994
[SPEAKER_03]: The controller.

325
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:22,982
[SPEAKER_01]: The controller is going to be mappable.

326
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:25,783
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's a custom controller.

327
00:21:25,823 --> 00:21:28,644
[SPEAKER_01]: Every game that you play is going to be a brand new controller.

328
00:21:29,724 --> 00:21:30,164
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see.

329
00:21:30,584 --> 00:21:37,345
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that it's going to be like that... What was that Atari thing where you hooked it to your head and then you blink and it makes a move left?

330
00:21:37,465 --> 00:21:39,265
[SPEAKER_00]: That's retarded.

331
00:21:39,325 --> 00:21:42,046
[SPEAKER_00]: Please don't.

332
00:21:42,146 --> 00:21:43,526
[SPEAKER_00]: Duke Nukem forever.

333
00:21:44,946 --> 00:21:46,467
[SPEAKER_00]: Forever before it comes out.

334
00:21:47,207 --> 00:21:47,307
[SPEAKER_00]: Um...

335
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:54,346
[SPEAKER_00]: The message boards on Duke Nukem Forever's website, located... I don't even know where it is.

336
00:21:54,366 --> 00:21:55,227
[SPEAKER_00]: 3D Realms' site.

337
00:21:55,487 --> 00:21:58,751
[SPEAKER_00]: On their message board, they're teasing it.

338
00:21:58,771 --> 00:22:08,981
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 enemies supposed to be showing up in there, and they're saying, they're swearing, a ton is done, we have hundreds of props that you can place in the world, and the artists just continue to pump stuff out.

339
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,697
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, they're saying they're going to show it at next year's E3.

340
00:22:12,717 --> 00:22:15,861
[SPEAKER_00]: I have two words for that.

341
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:17,082
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

342
00:22:17,582 --> 00:22:19,224
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the goods, people.

343
00:22:19,384 --> 00:22:20,165
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see the goods.

344
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:23,649
[SPEAKER_00]: But it makes me sad we haven't had a Duke Nukem.

345
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:25,311
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like the Phantom.

346
00:22:25,351 --> 00:22:26,191
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd the Phantom go?

347
00:22:26,211 --> 00:22:26,652
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's right.

348
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:27,713
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not there.

349
00:22:27,753 --> 00:22:28,274
[SPEAKER_00]: In the trash.

350
00:22:28,394 --> 00:22:28,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

351
00:22:28,934 --> 00:22:30,876
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but the Gizmondo's still hanging about.

352
00:22:32,738 --> 00:22:33,139
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

353
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,861
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get to the advice column.

354
00:22:36,901 --> 00:22:42,944
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, if we sat here and we talked about games all day long, we'd have no time to go out and go to golf clubs.

355
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:48,366
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to fill your heads with useless...

356
00:22:50,875 --> 00:22:56,320
[SPEAKER_03]: Today's advice is how to survive in Whitewater Rapids after falling out of your raft.

357
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:57,361
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one.

358
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:21,843
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were thrown from the raft, lie on your back, face up with your feet facing downstream.

359
00:23:23,604 --> 00:23:21,843
2.

360
00:23:24,344 --> 00:23:27,066
[SPEAKER_03]: If your raft is still accessible, swim for it and hold on.

361
00:23:27,346 --> 00:23:30,909
[SPEAKER_03]: Even if it is upside down, it can still provide protection from rocks and other obstacles.

362
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:30,909
3.

363
00:23:33,270 --> 00:23:35,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Be aware of the current and of river conditions.

364
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:39,374
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get to a calm area between rapids, vigorously swim for the shore.

365
00:23:40,715 --> 00:23:39,374
4.

366
00:23:41,175 --> 00:23:46,879
[SPEAKER_03]: Be prepared for a hole in the river where water recirculates, creating a whirlpool that can pull you under.

367
00:23:47,739 --> 00:23:52,602
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are caught in a hole, plunge your feet down as far as you can and actively swim to the bottom.

368
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:55,323
[SPEAKER_03]: You will soon be pulled from the hole by the current.

369
00:23:55,783 --> 00:23:57,124
[SPEAKER_03]: But my final piece of advice?

370
00:23:57,364 --> 00:23:57,584
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?

371
00:23:58,765 --> 00:24:00,646
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't go whitewater rafting.

372
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:04,148
[SPEAKER_03]: Go, like, hiking or something.

373
00:24:04,468 --> 00:24:05,809
[SPEAKER_03]: At least the bears are kinder.

374
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:08,910
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that.

375
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,232
[SPEAKER_00]: Useful, very useful piece of information.

376
00:24:12,372 --> 00:24:13,673
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody on the internet can use.

377
00:24:13,893 --> 00:24:15,834
[SPEAKER_01]: The bears are more afraid of you than they are of them.

378
00:24:16,154 --> 00:24:17,215
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so throw sticks at them.

379
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:21,404
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, you were playing the Matrix Online for what, like a week?

380
00:24:22,624 --> 00:24:22,865
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.

381
00:24:23,045 --> 00:24:26,127
[SPEAKER_00]: You were a big fan of the Matrix movies, even the second and third ones, right?

382
00:24:26,867 --> 00:24:28,368
[SPEAKER_01]: I still watch them.

383
00:24:28,668 --> 00:24:36,694
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have liked the second movie to have been what I read as the preview script, but apparently they punked it down.

384
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,016
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you feel about this in the Matrix Online this week?

385
00:24:40,276 --> 00:24:41,397
[SPEAKER_00]: They offed Morpheus!

386
00:24:41,994 --> 00:24:43,835
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's too early to be doing this, to be honest.

387
00:24:43,875 --> 00:24:59,948
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, I mean, granted, the game, everyone loved the fact that the main characters were in it and stuff, and I thought that they could drag it a little longer, but just giving the basic description of what happened, you know, apparently it looks like, I guess, Morpheus... I got it.

388
00:25:00,148 --> 00:25:00,608
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got it?

389
00:25:00,628 --> 00:25:00,868
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.

390
00:25:00,968 --> 00:25:07,333
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, anyways, Morpheus is basically, one of the plotlines, or storylines through this, is he's searching for Neo's body.

391
00:25:07,373 --> 00:25:08,114
[SPEAKER_01]: He's trying to get...

392
00:25:08,294 --> 00:25:10,576
[SPEAKER_01]: Neo back, because I think he thinks he's alive or something like that.

393
00:25:10,616 --> 00:25:25,466
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyways, so he's trying to recover Neo's body from the machines, but when the machines refuse to return Neo's remains, Morpheus began rampaging through Mega City, which is the city that this all takes place in, deadening code bombs strong enough to threaten the Matrix itself.

394
00:25:25,846 --> 00:25:29,509
[SPEAKER_01]: The machines responded by sending an assassin after Morpheus.

395
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,350
[SPEAKER_01]: The assassin succeeded and Morpheus was killed.

396
00:25:32,667 --> 00:25:43,892
[SPEAKER_01]: and basically now there's a new story arc, I guess, where players in the game are now have the opportunity to investigate the circumstances of Morpheus' death and participate in the new Matrix saga.

397
00:25:43,972 --> 00:25:46,794
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they're trying to figure out who the assassin is, I guess.

398
00:25:46,894 --> 00:25:47,314
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess.

399
00:25:47,634 --> 00:25:49,575
[SPEAKER_01]: And really there's like three sides to this.

400
00:25:49,815 --> 00:25:50,856
[SPEAKER_01]: You have like, you have the...

401
00:25:51,736 --> 00:25:52,657
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a weird buzzing.

402
00:25:52,677 --> 00:25:53,257
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry about that, guys.

403
00:25:53,677 --> 00:26:02,982
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the Zionist groups or whatever, and then you've got the, I guess, the Machines, and then some other... And the One-Armed Man.

404
00:26:03,542 --> 00:26:04,242
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the One-Armed Man.

405
00:26:04,822 --> 00:26:12,806
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, what it comes down to is at any time during this whole thing, they could just say, oh, we're going to resurrect him, and he's back.

406
00:26:12,886 --> 00:26:14,547
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, whatever.

407
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:16,328
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little really do that, just

408
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:19,703
[SPEAKER_00]: It was his sister.

409
00:26:19,863 --> 00:26:24,466
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always their sister that kills them.

410
00:26:24,586 --> 00:26:29,128
[SPEAKER_01]: I won Matrix Online right there.

411
00:26:30,108 --> 00:26:30,729
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, guess what?

412
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:33,210
[SPEAKER_01]: They've killed off all of them already, so who's left?

413
00:26:34,814 --> 00:26:35,415
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't tell you.

414
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:37,216
[SPEAKER_00]: Jada Pinkett?

415
00:26:39,238 --> 00:26:39,398
[SPEAKER_00]: No.

416
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:41,741
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

417
00:26:43,442 --> 00:26:45,304
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about this article.

418
00:26:45,504 --> 00:26:46,785
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this one's kind of interesting.

419
00:26:47,386 --> 00:26:58,856
[SPEAKER_00]: I was looking at Slashdot earlier this week, and they actually linked to somebody's blog, and this is on a site called corpnews.com, and somebody's just talking about E3, and I'm just going to kind of just

420
00:26:59,056 --> 00:27:00,257
[SPEAKER_00]: E3 is no longer useful as a trade show

421
00:27:21,096 --> 00:27:45,477
[SPEAKER_00]: The folks that work at the Best Buy, the EB Games, the CompUSA That it's become more about these booth babes and showing things off And that it's not very professional And the only place that you can find the professionalism Is to go to the upstairs area where it's nice and quiet And they're basically saying that a lot of the game companies have gotten a little more And I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing If you want to read the complete story, go to the website Um

422
00:27:47,101 --> 00:27:50,123
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically saying that a lot of the companies are getting very stingy.

423
00:27:50,423 --> 00:27:56,527
[SPEAKER_00]: Quote, companies like Vivendi and EA will ask for a name right off the bat before admitting you to their corporate Shangri-La.

424
00:27:56,827 --> 00:28:07,994
[SPEAKER_00]: Blizzard was running World of Warcraft media demos on the noisy show floor, and Nintendo did not even have enough press kits for all media, saying, we only give those out to major media outlets.

425
00:28:08,294 --> 00:28:08,814
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one.

426
00:28:09,234 --> 00:28:12,276
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I'm thinking DarkSakra got one somehow.

427
00:28:12,476 --> 00:28:13,557
[SPEAKER_01]: Major media outlets.

428
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:15,278
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, I did get mine on Wednesday.

429
00:28:16,372 --> 00:28:16,853
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, maybe.

430
00:28:16,873 --> 00:28:20,557
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a major media outlet, right?

431
00:28:20,577 --> 00:28:27,464
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the thing is that once we get our paperwork back, we're going to be up there.

432
00:28:28,325 --> 00:28:29,186
[SPEAKER_03]: We can only get bigger.

433
00:28:30,227 --> 00:28:33,630
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's good that they're willing to give us growing people.

434
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:35,312
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted, folks, we cover the news.

435
00:28:35,552 --> 00:28:37,915
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the gaming news better than, say, you know,

436
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:39,319
[SPEAKER_01]: Fox News

437
00:28:53,786 --> 00:28:54,887
[SPEAKER_03]: To get them excited.

438
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,629
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically word of mouth advertising is what they're trying to do.

439
00:28:58,370 --> 00:29:02,333
[SPEAKER_03]: And then for the ones who are true media, they're saving the real juicy bits.

440
00:29:02,853 --> 00:29:09,618
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when I got to play Popocoros or seeing the new Front Mission, that was pretty cool.

441
00:29:10,579 --> 00:29:13,560
[SPEAKER_03]: or the Call of Cthulhu demo that they were showing.

442
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:21,361
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also where you talk to their reps, find out, hey, this is what's going on.

443
00:29:21,461 --> 00:29:22,201
[SPEAKER_03]: These are our dates.

444
00:29:22,261 --> 00:29:23,182
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it's going to do.

445
00:29:23,402 --> 00:29:25,102
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what our business is looking like.

446
00:29:25,522 --> 00:29:35,664
[SPEAKER_03]: I do agree that you're going to, that's why they have those press rooms so that you can go up and get figures, get the business side of things, get dates, things like that.

447
00:29:36,164 --> 00:29:39,165
[SPEAKER_03]: See the stuff that they're not going to put out on the main floor.

448
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:43,307
[SPEAKER_03]: I really do think that the main floor is a method of advertising.

449
00:29:44,547 --> 00:29:46,348
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not always the way it used to be.

450
00:29:46,608 --> 00:29:48,849
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think about it, it's really ballooned in the past few years.

451
00:29:48,869 --> 00:29:54,771
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what this guy's kind of trying to say because he's saying he's been for like the past six years and just he's kind of watched this whole thing evolve.

452
00:29:54,811 --> 00:29:57,992
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I think the core thing is, is that E3's really evolved.

453
00:29:58,293 --> 00:30:03,875
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you think about it, even just like four years ago, did it seem like E3 was such this big deal that like

454
00:30:04,375 --> 00:30:08,797
[SPEAKER_00]: TV stations were broadcasting live and the internet was lit up with talk and all that.

455
00:30:08,877 --> 00:30:13,979
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, you heard about E3 and you read about it in magazines, but was it really such a freaking big deal as it is now?

456
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,581
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, now it's like the holiday of gamers, it seems like.

457
00:30:16,621 --> 00:30:18,622
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how things are and the companies are catering to it.

458
00:30:18,662 --> 00:30:19,882
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's pretty smart on their end.

459
00:30:20,142 --> 00:30:21,003
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's interesting.

460
00:30:21,143 --> 00:30:21,723
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, any thoughts?

461
00:30:21,897 --> 00:30:30,199
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with some of the aspects like when he's talking about like basically your fry cooks of the video game industry getting into E3.

462
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:35,621
[SPEAKER_01]: Granted that there are these people getting into E3 and this is why you have your three hour waits to go see stuff.

463
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:48,204
[SPEAKER_01]: It's because of all these nobodies that are entering into E3 that have really no business being there other than the fact that oh I work for a video game or a game store or I work at a store that sells games or

464
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:52,228
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the retailers need to actually have some sort of signed release.

465
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:59,016
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's not management, then the general everybody else would need a signed release form to go with it.

466
00:30:59,136 --> 00:31:00,437
[SPEAKER_03]: You provide that with your credentials.

467
00:31:01,218 --> 00:31:06,464
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also the people, though, who get in once, and then every year they get their new invite.

468
00:31:08,208 --> 00:31:10,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I got mine this year the same way.

469
00:31:10,512 --> 00:31:17,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's because maybe the attendance thing is a selling point of the whole show so they want more people to go even if it's cheapening the show?

470
00:31:17,404 --> 00:31:18,226
[SPEAKER_03]: It is advertisement.

471
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,690
[SPEAKER_03]: It puts money in their pockets.

472
00:31:22,310 --> 00:31:27,691
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's still all those people who are willing to go out there and shell out the 300 some odd dollars it costs for a badge.

473
00:31:28,271 --> 00:31:30,112
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there will be changes next year.

474
00:31:30,152 --> 00:31:32,852
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's inevitable there will be some type of change next year.

475
00:31:32,952 --> 00:31:33,813
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?

476
00:31:33,893 --> 00:31:34,793
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been proven wrong before.

477
00:31:35,933 --> 00:31:36,293
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.

478
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:37,674
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on.

479
00:31:38,314 --> 00:31:39,334
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought this was interesting.

480
00:31:39,614 --> 00:31:41,775
[SPEAKER_00]: 1up.com actually ran this story earlier this week.

481
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:42,515
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was cute.

482
00:31:42,535 --> 00:31:42,815
[SPEAKER_00]: 80 year old

483
00:31:44,329 --> 00:31:45,089
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

484
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,820
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

485
00:32:21,529 --> 00:32:28,752
[SPEAKER_00]: and she got a call from gaming legend Billy Mitchell who offered to loan her a Qbert machine to practice and win back the title.

486
00:32:29,152 --> 00:32:32,614
[SPEAKER_00]: So gaming grandma's back to reclaim the Qbert throne.

487
00:32:32,814 --> 00:32:35,795
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to laugh if she was playing Halo 2 or something like that, you know.

488
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:38,056
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get you!

489
00:32:38,136 --> 00:32:42,118
[SPEAKER_03]: In general, because I suck at Qbert and I played a whole crap load of it on my Clicca Vision.

490
00:32:43,104 --> 00:32:43,505
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too.

491
00:32:43,525 --> 00:32:44,285
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine?

492
00:32:44,365 --> 00:32:50,850
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's bad enough getting fragged by the 12-year-olds on Xbox Live who then proceed to tease you and, you know, call you names.

493
00:32:51,150 --> 00:32:52,851
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you imagine getting shot by Grandma?

494
00:32:55,574 --> 00:32:56,054
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what?

495
00:32:56,114 --> 00:32:57,015
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, yes.

496
00:32:57,455 --> 00:33:02,158
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember back when I had my Nintendo and my mother played it more than I did.

497
00:33:03,379 --> 00:33:06,362
[SPEAKER_03]: Granted, my mother is only 17 years older than I am, but still.

498
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:11,445
[SPEAKER_00]: The only game I could ever get my mother to play with me was Family Feud on the Commodore 64.

499
00:33:12,665 --> 00:33:15,566
[SPEAKER_03]: My mom was like freaking awesome at Super Mario Brothers.

500
00:33:15,706 --> 00:33:17,027
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all foreign to me.

501
00:33:17,067 --> 00:33:21,168
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents... And she would regularly kick my ass at Dr. Mario.

502
00:33:21,368 --> 00:33:26,930
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's weird because my dad now watches G4 because he loved tech TV.

503
00:33:27,371 --> 00:33:32,672
[SPEAKER_00]: And although he's been kind of ticked off at the fact that when G4 kind of ate tech TV, all the shows got lost.

504
00:33:33,033 --> 00:33:34,713
[SPEAKER_00]: He's still... It's like he clings to it.

505
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:39,275
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think because of that, he's picked up all this gaming knowledge, which is kind of impressive.

506
00:33:39,555 --> 00:33:40,115
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cute.

507
00:33:40,435 --> 00:33:40,916
[SPEAKER_00]: It is cute.

508
00:33:40,956 --> 00:33:41,356
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very cute.

509
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,896
[SPEAKER_00]: My dad's cute.

510
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,291
[SPEAKER_00]: Loki, is this going to be you someday?

511
00:33:45,311 --> 00:33:46,891
[SPEAKER_00]: 80-year-old gaming grandpa?

512
00:33:47,331 --> 00:33:47,551
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.

513
00:33:49,072 --> 00:33:52,092
[SPEAKER_01]: Seriously, I'm going to be the coolest dad on the block.

514
00:33:52,232 --> 00:33:54,393
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my own goddamn video game cabinet.

515
00:33:54,953 --> 00:33:56,434
[SPEAKER_01]: How many dads can say that?

516
00:33:57,134 --> 00:34:00,475
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember the days before we had this hologram shit.

517
00:34:01,315 --> 00:34:02,896
[SPEAKER_01]: When I'm old, though.

518
00:34:02,976 --> 00:34:05,776
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be in line as the 80-year-old grandpa.

519
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,197
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you're getting a free kid?

520
00:34:07,357 --> 00:34:08,777
[SPEAKER_00]: Fuck that, give it for me!

521
00:34:09,357 --> 00:34:11,158
[SPEAKER_00]: I will still aspire...

522
00:34:12,264 --> 00:34:18,038
[SPEAKER_00]: to yell at kids who are walking on my lawn while I'm playing the PSP or something. 5.0.

523
00:34:21,570 --> 00:34:22,890
[SPEAKER_00]: My future, they won't be wearing pants.

524
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:24,091
[SPEAKER_02]: Get off my lawn!

525
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,892
[SPEAKER_02]: Give me back my video game!

526
00:34:47,978 --> 00:34:54,962
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the reason why the gaming site felt the need to run this story is that number three was Woot.

527
00:34:56,082 --> 00:34:56,923
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate that word.

528
00:34:57,483 --> 00:34:58,023
[SPEAKER_00]: Woot!

529
00:34:58,323 --> 00:35:00,084
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised Pwned isn't on there.

530
00:35:00,605 --> 00:35:01,665
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised that too.

531
00:35:01,705 --> 00:35:02,606
[SPEAKER_00]: Some other highlights.

532
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:03,406
[SPEAKER_03]: This list is retarded.

533
00:35:03,506 --> 00:35:05,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, Ginormous.

534
00:35:05,859 --> 00:35:06,779
[SPEAKER_00]: I use that word all the time.

535
00:35:06,799 --> 00:35:07,260
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use that.

536
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:07,980
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it too.

537
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:11,441
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two, confuzzled, whatever you want to say, confused and puzzled.

538
00:35:11,962 --> 00:35:20,445
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, one I think is too good to pass up, number nine, snert, snow that is dirty, which is a word I never heard before seeing that poll.

539
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:23,227
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, we live in California, so maybe that's what it's about.

540
00:35:23,487 --> 00:35:23,987
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

541
00:35:25,708 --> 00:35:26,108
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.

542
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,029
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple more, just real quick.

543
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:28,749
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

544
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:31,190
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a couple stories from another website you wanted to share.

545
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:31,410
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up?

546
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:32,591
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just want to share these.

547
00:35:33,686 --> 00:35:40,467
[SPEAKER_01]: The Game Boy Micro, the brand new Game Boy Advance that they're getting you to buy, is going to be marketed as a media player.

548
00:35:40,788 --> 00:35:44,248
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, why do you really want to watch movies on a one-inch screen?

549
00:35:44,328 --> 00:35:46,249
[SPEAKER_01]: But whatever.

550
00:35:46,429 --> 00:35:50,570
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's the Game Boy Micro bundled with the Play-Anne adapter.

551
00:35:50,850 --> 00:36:01,312
[SPEAKER_01]: For those who don't know, it uses the little SD cards to actually be able to play movies, and it plugs into your Game Boy Advance player, or your Game Boy Micro in this case.

552
00:36:02,413 --> 00:36:08,379
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, it's a $70 value that they're going to be marketing with that.

553
00:36:08,479 --> 00:36:10,822
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, 2-inch screen movies.

554
00:36:11,182 --> 00:36:12,483
[SPEAKER_01]: You think that's going to be popular?

555
00:36:12,503 --> 00:36:13,865
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

556
00:36:14,446 --> 00:36:19,171
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to see what the Game Boy Micro looks like, you can go to OrangeZoneRadio.com and check out my pictures of E3.

557
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:20,222
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.

558
00:36:20,363 --> 00:36:20,863
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice plug.

559
00:36:20,883 --> 00:36:22,384
[SPEAKER_01]: He's so small.

560
00:36:22,964 --> 00:36:24,165
[SPEAKER_03]: It is really little, though.

561
00:36:24,585 --> 00:36:27,787
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine playing a role-playing game where you have to read text on it, though.

562
00:36:29,248 --> 00:36:32,991
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine trying to play Fire Emblem on that thing where you have to move your little tiny characters on it.

563
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,091
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine that.

564
00:36:34,332 --> 00:36:36,533
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get the Game Boy Micro, but whatever.

565
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:37,714
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whatever.

566
00:36:38,955 --> 00:36:40,255
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be worse things.

567
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:41,056
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Virtual Boy.

568
00:36:41,076 --> 00:36:41,917
[SPEAKER_03]: It didn't look too bad.

569
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,942
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple other things, now we go to the PSP side of things.

570
00:36:46,822 --> 00:36:57,624
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy.com, those folks behind the wonderful stuff like Pimp My Weapon and the music that sucks, they have new PSP content you can download from their website.

571
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:00,245
[SPEAKER_01]: So go check that out, and that's Heavy.com.

572
00:37:00,965 --> 00:37:08,867
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, on the underground front here, they have the Rin version 1.18, which is the brand new Game Boy...

573
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:33,537
[SPEAKER_01]: Color Emulator and they're working on right now a working version of SNES 9X which is the Super Nintendo Emulator to work on the version 1.5 PSPs which are all the US ones because currently all the ones that they have right now only work on the Japanese models the first launch ones which are version 1.0 that reminds me of the other thing I've been playing this week Final Fantasy 6 ROM translated by fans

574
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:35,032
[SPEAKER_03]: Saken Densetsu 3

575
00:37:50,886 --> 00:37:51,546
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard about that.

576
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:52,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I played it.

577
00:37:52,507 --> 00:37:53,007
