Hello once again everybody, and a happy Memorial Day week to you guys.

00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:27,200
Hope you had fun with your three-day weekend.

7

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,280
Maybe you're still enjoying that three-day weekend.

9
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:34,560
Let us not forget the veterans that gave us this day

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,960
and fought for our country.

11
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:40,480
Don't forget the masses of the retail.

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,600
Those who have to work on Memorial Day.

13
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,200
That too, that too.

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,480
The voice you hear back there is my lovely co-host,

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,360
Jamie Summers, Dark Sakura.

16
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:50,520
Yeah, yeah.

17
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,040
My name, of course, being Rob Roberts, also known as Sky.

18
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:53,800
Yeah, yeah.

19
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,560
And that other guy over there in the corner.

20
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,760
Say hello to Loki.

21
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:57,960
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,240
Who cares?

23
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:01,240
Boy, you guys are very agreeable tonight.

24
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,520
Yeah, whatever.

25
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,440
We're all here, live in the flesh, in the fresh.

26
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,600
In the frat.

27
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,920
I thought you said in the frat.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,520
We're fresh.

29
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:10,480
We're fresh here at Orange Laundry in the flesh.

30
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:11,360
Yo, yo, yo.

31
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,200
No Skype in here, because Skype cuts out too much for us,

32
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,480
so we can't do the Skype thing.

33
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:17,460
Yeah, we're not like from yesterday.

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,000
We were freshly purchased today.

35
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:20,880
Big thank you.

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,760
Big thank you, starting off the show tonight.

37
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:25,280
Before we get into any games whatsoever, big, big thank you

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,420
to iPotter.org and the one and only Adam Curry for, I guess,

39
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:31,660
noticing us this week.

40
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:32,940
Best hair ever.

41
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,580
I agree.

42
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,980
When I think of the 80s, I will always think of that hair.

43
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:39,740
But seriously, we got noticed on iPotter.org this week,

44
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:42,440
which is really weird because we didn't submit anything

45
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:42,940
over there.

46
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,020
So I don't know if one of our fans did it or what,

47
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,820
but we just showed up on there suddenly.

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:49,280
And usually I'm pretty good about submitting our show

49
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,740
to like Podcast Alley, Podcast Pickle, Podcast this,

50
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,140
Podcast that, whatever shows up.

51
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:58,720
have a podcast pick yes believe it or not it's it they got podcast everything

52
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:05,480
it's it's the new thing like a from J inside about podcast poop shoot yes

53
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:10,840
somebody is probably registering it as we speak but regardless for whatever

54
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:14,780
reason we never got submitted to ipod or dot org until this week and it was huge

55
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:20,560
for our traffic so welcome to all our new subscribers just a quick FYI what we

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:24,640
what we do, Orange Lounge Radio, we've been around for like three years, we've

57
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,240
only been podcasting since January, internet radio station that runs live 24

58
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,240
hours a day, seven days a week, dedicated to rhythm and music gaming, but this is

59
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,440
part of our expansion into other video games. We want to talk about other games

60
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,680
and other gamings and video games that don't suck and news that you guys really

61
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,080
want to know about. So that's what we're all about and we just want to produce

62
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,560
for you guys like a 30-40 minute show, something long enough for you guys to

63
00:02:47,560 --> 00:02:50,840
listen to while you're commuting just to keep you up on all the news and all that

64
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:55,120
stuff so and sometimes we like to argue and bicker back and forth and we do

65
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,960
sometimes we do some things shut up we do bitch we do some things that are

66
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,720
outside of games sometimes as well like dark soccer's advice column which we'll

67
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,760
get to a little later exactly but first off strictly the games welcome back dark

68
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,360
soccer you weren't here last week no I was busy being coma actually I was busy

69
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,760
being submitted to episode 3 so this is the first time a lot of the iPod or

70
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,480
folks get to hear your lovely voice so unless they download a previous episode

71
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:24,000
that's right which I hope they did what's up how was your gaming week I

72
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:30,040
played PSO blue burst for like four hours yesterday I quit Final Fantasy 11

73
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:35,480
yesterday as I quit Final Fantasy 11 finally as well and the clouds came down

74
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:42,120
and saying and it was pretty groovy and I played um some Silent Hill 3 I'm close

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,760
to the end, and then the hospital right now.

76
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,000
Oh, very cool.

77
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
You know what though?

78
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,340
You know you're addicted to MMOs though, seriously, when you quit Final Fantasy XI and then freaking

79
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,480
sign up for Guild Wars.

80
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,280
I mean, did I really accomplish anything?

81
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,040
Did you really accomplish anything going from Final Fantasy XI to Blue Burst?

82
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:05,960
Yeah, but with Blue Burst, it's windowed and I can do other crap while my little Fenerwhirl

83
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:09,080
is regenerating her TP.

84
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,800
I don't really see it as necessarily leaving one game for another, I just kind of see it

85
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,760
as I'm bored with this toy and I want a new toy now.

86
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,520
I've always gone back to PSO, but when Ragnarok 2 comes out, oh, you better watch.

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,280
What is this, the fourth time on PSO?

88
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:28,800
You got Dreamcast, GameCube, Xbox, now PC.

89
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:34,000
Yeah, but the Dreamcast one pissed me off because it wouldn't work with the broadband

90
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,040
converter they had.

91
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:40,080
I didn't own a Dreamcast until years later when they were like $50, and I only bought

92
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,400
it so I could emulate Nintendo games on it.

93
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,000
But then I discovered that Soul Calibur is really cool, and I kind of went back and rediscovered

94
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
all these Dreamcast games.

95
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,520
Soul Calibur is all about playing that game with the damn fishing rod.

96
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,920
Because the fishing rod is analog.

97
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,380
And when you sling it, it hits buttons.

98
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,240
The triggers inside are buttons.

99
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:02,600
So, rod caliber is the most fun ever.

100
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:03,600
Wow.

101
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,860
like people who play like Tekken with their DDR mats and I tried playing Soul

102
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:12,960
Calibur with my DDR pad the only analog button on the Dreamcast dance pad is the

103
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:17,080
Konami logo and it's only left and right that's odd all right all right anyway

104
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:25,040
any other games you played this week step on the cat that's it is that a

105
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:29,200
flash game all right no was when sure me is on the floor that gonna be an Xbox

106
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:33,920
360 launch title and you step on her not very hard and she just flattens herself

107
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:40,080
like this big ball of cat fat and looks up and goes no okay you can go yeah when

108
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,520
she scatters off Loki step on the cat her favorite thing Loki white games

109
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,840
you've been playing um actually I played Final Fantasy 11 because you all people

110
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
Suck.

111
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,000
Oh yeah, well at least I'm not leaving for another MMO, okay?

112
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Sheesh.

113
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,120
I don't know if that's better or worse, but anyways.

114
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:07,600
So yeah, I have my character who's level 58 now, finally, and I bought new armor today,

115
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,320
just a corpse plus one, because I will not settle for the ordinary armor, I have to have

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,560
the plus one armor.

117
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,000
You ever seen that shirt on the internet that says, I'm not a dork, I'm a level 12 paladin?

118
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,520
That's what you're reminding me of right now.

119
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:24,360
You're gonna be on the street one day with one of those cardboard pieces of thing.

120
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:29,880
If you want to get technical, I am a level 12 paladin, but I play a level 58 black mage

121
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,880
to be honest.

122
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:31,880
My bad.

123
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,880
We'll play FFXi for food.

124
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:38,560
Oh no no, we'll give head for Final Fantasy, I don't know.

125
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,560
Alright, let him finish.

126
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,900
We'll give head for Final Fantasy.

127
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:41,900
We got news to get to.

128
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:47,200
Anyways, so I play Final Fantasy, I play a little bit of my cell phone game Worms, yeah

129
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,200
you remember that game Worms?

130
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Well, it doesn't really transition well over to the cell phone a lot of games don't FYI for some reason

131
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:59,380
I'm like they did he just get pissed off that I'm kicking their ass and they just they just committed suicide

132
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,580
They just walk right off the screen into the water and die

133
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,420
I'm like, what the hell kind of AI is that?

134
00:07:05,940 --> 00:07:11,240
Seriously, this is awesome mobile games now is all about the retro factor or

135
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,520
or it's like bejeweled on your phone.

136
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,520
It's like $5 for this piece of crap, yay.

137
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,520
Bejeweled came on my phone as well. Yeah, so I played that and

138
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,040
that's pretty much it. Really haven't played much as far as games this week.

139
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:28,280
Alright. Myself, I actually

140
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:31,280
picked up a copy of Fable because Fable was running

141
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:35,360
on sale, $30, and it was one of those Xbox games where everybody was like,

142
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,080
dude, if you have an Xbox, you have to have Fable.

143
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:40,480
You have to have it. Because, like, you know, it's like the one RPG,

144
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,080
classic RPG they have on Xbox. So I picked it up and

145
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:49,720
it's kinda neat. I really really like the concept behind Fable where you can

146
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,680
kinda forge your own destiny kinda thing. Like it's the first game I've ever

147
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,600
played where you can aspire to be a gay whore

148
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,120
if you want. And the game will still reward you for that. You can have your

149
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,200
twelve houses with

150
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:06,040
boyfriends if you want. I think if you hang around in the towns too long they chase

151
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,640
you off.

152
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:16,640
It depends on if you're good or bad, but you can completely play the game as a good guy or you can completely play as a bad guy, so you kind of forge your own path, which is kind of nice.

153
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,640
And you can have the people refer to you as R-Space, because you get to choose your own title later on.

154
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,640
And your character changes in appearance, depending on whether you're good or bad.

155
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,640
Yeah, if you have your arm cut off, they call you stubby or something.

156
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,080
Yeah, graphics, pretty nice, but the only problem I noticed with Fable is that sometimes

157
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,440
it's a little bit skippy, like kind of like has some loading skips, awful long loading

158
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:41,280
times in between areas though for such small areas.

159
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,400
I'm kind of nitpicking a little bit though because honestly the cutscene graphics are

160
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,120
really great.

161
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,640
I really am impressed with the graphics mostly, but just little skips were a little bit annoying.

162
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,240
The sound is awesome, the sound in the game, it's got its own like original score I think

163
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:58,400
that was done by Danny Elfman, at least one of the songs, but the rest of the music really

164
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
fits into that.

165
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:04,360
The only problem I had with the sound though is that sometimes it was overbearing.

166
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,800
Like for instance this one scene I'm trying to get trained on magic and I can't even hear

167
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,040
the guy talking because all I can hear is the waterfall behind me.

168
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,400
So the sound kind of gets annoying sometimes, but the score is really great.

169
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,320
Like they could release the score as a CD and probably sell it.

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,580
But overall I think the game's kind of fun, it has a lot of fun stuff going for it.

171
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:25,760
So I'd probably give it like, I don't know, I'd give it an above average score, like a

172
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:27,960
3 out of 5 stars.

173
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,960
I'm not sure yet though I still gotta really play a little more with it I'm only like two

174
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,720
hours into it so the verdict's still out but I'm having fun with it.

175
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,720
Actually I did get a new game.

176
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,800
What'd you get?

177
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:36,800
Well Dan bought me Technic Beat.

178
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,800
Oh what'd you think?

179
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:38,800
I haven't played it yet.

180
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,800
I played it.

181
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,800
Oh well.

182
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,600
I watched you play and I'm like oh Technic Beat.

183
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:44,600
Tell us about it next week then.

184
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,600
That'll work.

185
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,720
It's still sitting on my desk.

186
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,360
For those just tuning in I give Smart Bomb a 1 out of 5 because it sucks ass.

187
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,500
Why is that?

188
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,340
Because first off, the game has such long loading times and the puzzles are fucking

189
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:02,440
hard and it makes you want to actually throw your PSP, which is never a feeling you should

190
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:05,960
have with a PSP because they're expensive and if you throw it, it'll probably break.

191
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,720
So I'm actually returning the game back because I don't want it.

192
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,460
Speaking of the PSP, before we get into game news, this is one I want to know about.

193
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,120
What was that game you were showing me, it was like a pinball game, but you played the

194
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,800
PSP on its side, where it's like vertical up and down with some pinball game?

195
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:27,680
It's actually this game called, it's two brand new games actually coming out from Hudson.

196
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,440
And there's one, it's a pinball game, which is simply called pinball right now, and you

197
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,600
actually hold the PSP on its right side, so basically you'd be using the triangle and

198
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:41,160
X button, I believe, and you play it basically vertically.

199
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,140
And there's also another game called Star Soldier, which is going to be coming out,

200
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:48,980
which is also played that way, just like the old school vertical shooter games.

201
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:56,040
Star Soldier wasn't that a Sega CD game I don't know I have no idea I know there

202
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,180
was a game actually no I'm thinking turbo graphics duo there was a game

203
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:03,680
called Star Soldier no maybe this is it and Hudson Hudson Hudson did a lot of

204
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:10,040
games for graphics didn't they right and they did a a parody version called Star

205
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:17,360
Parodia which you could play as Twinbee or you could play as a as a Bomberman

206
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:24,020
because Hudson also did Bomberman or you could play as a flying PC engine I just

207
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:28,400
think the idea of the PSP on its side is cute I don't know why but it's not

208
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:32,600
innovative Bondi already did that with the WonderSwan but who how many people

209
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,940
in America played the WonderSwan because you and who else okay now we're gonna

210
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,220
get some emails but like Klonoa on WonderSwan we all know Klonoa it's like

211
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:46,980
one of the key things that they still need to make more of but you um switch

212
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:50,020
Besides, when you played that, depending on the level, you'd have vertical levels where

213
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,580
you'd keep climbing up, and you would turn your Wonderswan around and play that way.

214
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:58,060
So it's not a new idea, but it's something a lot of people haven't seen.

215
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,060
Yeah.

216
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,060
Granted.

217
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,060
So, alright.

218
00:12:01,060 --> 00:12:03,620
Anyway, let's move on to some actual gaming news.

219
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:07,620
Following up from E3, you guys remember when we went to the Final Fantasy concert, that

220
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:12,380
guy who was emceeing, he's a voice actor in the game, and he said that he would be at

221
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:15,540
E3 that Wednesday, because he was the voice of Tidus in the game.

222
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:19,240
I never saw him there, but of course I wasn't hanging out at the Square Enix booth the whole

223
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,240
time.

224
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,080
But I remember whispering to Loker, I said, I bet you anything, it's about the upcoming

225
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,940
voice actor strike.

226
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,240
Because you know, just kind of the way he was phrasing things and stuff.

227
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:33,800
And sure enough, game voice actors were out there picketing at E3.

228
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:36,620
So I guess I assumed that he was going to be in the show.

229
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:40,960
I wonder if they were picketing using, you know, the voices of the characters and stuff,

230
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:41,960
because that would be great.

231
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:44,920
You know, I didn't even see them anywhere.

232
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,120
I might have missed it, but again, the E3 is so packed and crowded, I don't know.

233
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,460
But the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists

234
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:58,100
are trying to negotiate a new agreement with game publishers regarding voice acting.

235
00:12:58,100 --> 00:13:02,940
Basically what it comes down to is that right now voice actors are paid a one-time fee upfront

236
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,780
for their services, but no, no, no, voice actors want some type of payment based on

237
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,220
the successes of the game, like, you know, residuals, if the game sells so many copies

238
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,220
we want to cut it.

239
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:19,920
royalties basically so what do you think is that sound fair they're entitled it's

240
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:26,280
their talent being lent to the you know it happens to regular stage actors they

241
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:31,040
still make money off you know like I was watching some special about Greece and

242
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:36,000
they still get a regular check yeah for any money that the movie still makes

243
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,760
only like a dollar or so but they still get it still something even I think that

244
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,760
the same should apply to the voice actors you know what about the flip

245
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,620
side of this where some a lot of folks say and I tend to think about this a

246
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:52,160
little bit too where whereas you have the voice actors in movie based games

247
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,880
where the game just isn't the same without the original voice actor take

248
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,300
for instance I don't know Buffy and the Buffy game wasn't the same it wasn't in

249
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,420
it it wasn't the Sarah Michelle Gellar right right but everybody else is there

250
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,580
did that kind did did that one voice not being right kind of detract from the

251
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:10,640
game I don't know maybe I don't know she sounded just like her well then let me

252
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:13,740
think of a better example say you were trying to replace Marlon Brando in the

253
00:14:13,740 --> 00:14:17,420
upcoming Godfather game. That just wouldn't be the same, right? I don't know, maybe it's debatable.

254
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:21,900
Not necessarily. Here's an example, kind of an old example, but Indiana Jones The Fate of Atlantis,

255
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:25,500
it was not Harrison Ford doing Indiana Jones voice, still felt fine to me.

256
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:31,740
True. So some folks say that, you know, does it really, really have to be the actual actor's

257
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:38,060
voice? And the thing is why some people say, you know, you could probably find fanboys and girls

258
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:43,660
that would be willing to do the voice acting for you for free or for minimum wage. So do you think

259
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:49,160
do it I know and I said you're going I do it too but I don't know is that a is

260
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,280
that an option can they really break the union thing are they gonna set themselves

261
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:58,040
up for real comes down to is they need to actually be negotiating their

262
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,880
contract a little bit better that's what it comes down to if you want to get paid

263
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,160
by royalties don't take the job then okay then let me kind of rephrase my

264
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:09,200
question this way how important is voice acting in a game to you pretty important

265
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:12,320
since a lot of the games are reliant on that to go along with the visual

266
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,320
especially need good voice acting

267
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:18,920
but even now I say even when there's bad voice acting you can make a game great

268
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,280
case in point Resident Evil

269
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:23,280
yeah or Castlevania

270
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:26,680
psychic zone evil zone that was it

271
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:30,440
honestly though if the game as a whole were like

272
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,960
a hundred okay the voice acting would probably be fall under about three

273
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:38,640
to me three points out of a hundred that's how much it paid

274
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:42,240
you know how much I care about it really is a man good voice acting to me to make

275
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:42,920
a break a game

276
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:46,040
I think the voice acting to make a good game better

277
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:49,960
but I don't think you can save a game I mean a crappy game still a crappy game

278
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:50,720
you could have

279
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,080
the guy who does all the movie trailers who has the sexiest voice in the world

280
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,120
mister movie phone

281
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,880
or we get the movie phone guy you could have either than the game at the game

282
00:15:58,880 --> 00:15:59,760
sucks the game sucks

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:03,200
you know though especially though for

284
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,520
games that are ported over from Japanese is where they redid all the voices

285
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:11,160
half the time I expect it to be awful, so I like to be pleasantly surprised when there's

286
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:14,440
good voice acting in it.

287
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:20,480
And nowadays, I expect there to be good voice acting, and if there's not, I'm disappointed.

288
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:25,080
So I think that they should be rewarded for the quality of their work, but I do think

289
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,640
that because they do put so much work, it's acting the same as anything on the stage,

290
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,120
and they should be rewarded for it.

291
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,440
Okay, well I can go with that.

292
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,200
Regardless though, here's the bottom line.

293
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,880
Why do we have to fight all the time, guys?

294
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,760
Can't we all just get along?

295
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,760
How about a hug?

296
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,760
Sorry, Rob, that doesn't work.

297
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:42,760
How about a hug?

298
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:49,020
Can't the voice actors in the gaming publishing companies just hug?

299
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,240
Xbox 360 is on the way.

300
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,720
$300 is the rumored price point.

301
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:58,980
I always thought 360 would probably be what they'd charge for it, you know, ha ha ha,

302
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,800
get it, Xbox 360, 360.

303
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:05,000
they're still saying that that's a possibility but that 300 is kind of the

304
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:09,980
target price point for the new system so based on what you saw at e3 is this

305
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:17,300
worth $300 like yes it was brilliant really yes I paid 300 from my PlayStation

306
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:22,820
2 might as well I paid 400 for my jps to allow me to be the first to say no I

307
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:28,620
will wait for the first price cut I am more I've just I'm not really sold on

308
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,380
any of the launch titles yet my opinion could change but there is nothing on the

309
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:36,960
xbox that's making me go I have to have this system when it launches do I want

310
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,700
the system yes eventually wait wait here here's what's selling it for me all

311
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:49,460
right what do a volleyball too I know it's not but it's coming it will be good

312
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:52,980
I'm looking forward to do a for and then I've been actually looking forward to

313
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,220
quake for it looks pretty cool I'm more excited to is on it I'm honestly more

314
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:02,100
excited about PS3 right now, and so I feel like I want to save my money and get a PS3.

315
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:05,780
I did also go to the PS3 demo, well you know I'm going to have them both, so it doesn't

316
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,780
matter.

317
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,260
Honestly, when it gets down to about the Xbox 360 time, we'll already have the game room

318
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:15,660
at my work, and we'll have a 360 there, so I really don't need to buy one.

319
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:19,440
Here's what I'll bet they'll do, I'll bet you anything this is what happens, although

320
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,460
I could be wrong.

321
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:25,940
They'll sell the system for like $300, they'll do like a bare bones thing for $300, but if

322
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:31,220
buy the 360, they'll do some kind of cheap little time where it's like the 360 pack or

323
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:36,660
something that'll go for $360 and it comes with a game and like Xbox Live for so many

324
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:39,020
months or something, you know, a pretty controller.

325
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,820
It'll come with a game, it'll come with another controller, it'll come with brand new game

326
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:44,820
skins!

327
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:45,820
Woo!

328
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,180
And new power button things.

329
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:51,020
I do think that they are being smart with how they're combating the PS3 release because

330
00:18:51,020 --> 00:18:52,900
they're going to be doing Halo 3.

331
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,300
Yeah, we talked about that on a previous show.

332
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:55,300
That is smart.

333
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,300
That is very smart.

334
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:59,440
Yeah, it is, but I think the hardcore gamer is not going to be affected.

335
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Honestly.

336
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:03,200
I did stay in line though for both demos.

337
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:08,520
And I have to say though that, you know, the Xbox 360, I'm really looking forward to a

338
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:13,640
lot, because not only is it a system, but it's also a multimedia docking station.

339
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,960
And it even showed a picture of a PSP hooking up to it.

340
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,880
Anything basically that's USB firewire is going to hook up to it.

341
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:25,040
And that lends more use than just a video game system.

342
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,040
meant to be an all-encompassing entertainment system.

343
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:31,520
Well, I've said this before, the next generation of gaming is about more than just gaming.

344
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:35,000
How would you like to watch your UMD movies on an HDTV?

345
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,580
You can't watch your UMD movies on HDTV with this thing.

346
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:43,140
All it's going to be is just, oh look, I can now load my MP3s that I bought with on Xbox

347
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,980
Live to my MP3 player.

348
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,980
I think you're right.

349
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,400
There's a lot more than that though.

350
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,280
It's going to an entertainment system, not just gaming.

351
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,640
They're also showing this one about designing your own shirts on there, having them shipped

352
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,600
out as a t-shirt, and you can sell them through the Xbox system.

353
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,600
They had them on there.

354
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,580
Are they going to be crappy, like a certain nameless site, which does a lot of shirt printing

355
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,080
for people, and then the shirts wash out after they wash out?

356
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,080
I don't know.

357
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:15,200
It didn't say anything about that, but it's saying, though, that you can market your art,

358
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,520
you can show your designs, you can share, you can create a community real-time chat.

359
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:20,520
Wow.

360
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:22,520
Last time I checked, I thought that's what the internet was for.

361
00:20:22,520 --> 00:20:27,800
I mean, why do I have to pay $300 for this console that I can do what, you know, I can

362
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,960
do on the internet for free?

363
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,600
Uh, no, sorry, I'm not gonna do that.

364
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,600
I don't give crap.

365
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,760
A gaming console is a gaming console is a gaming console.

366
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:36,640
It's not a multimedia, you know, device.

367
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,840
If I wanted a multimedia device, I'll buy a media PC.

368
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,280
Oh, wait, no, I'm not gonna touch that either because they're expensive and you just...

369
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,760
How about a big whatever to all of that?

370
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:45,360
A system is only good as the games that are on it.

371
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,360
There you go.

372
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,360
There you go.

373
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:50,480
Of course, though, I was more impressed with the PS3 demo and, you know, I really liked

374
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:55,520
don't want to be a hoarder Sony but watching Jin sweat just made me all

375
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:00,520
gushy I know I'm holding out for Nintendo's revolution laugh at me now

376
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:05,000
but I'll tell you what when those first screenshots come out of Mario and link

377
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:10,360
on the revolution your boner will be nice had they put forth the goods at e3

378
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:14,920
I I think I think they could I think that might have shot him in the foot I

379
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:20,360
don't think it did I already knew it's revolutionary what the controller the

380
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:25,280
controller is going to be mappable basically it's your it's a custom

381
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:29,840
controller every game that you play is going to be a brand new controller we'll

382
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,240
see I think that it's going to be like that what was that Atari thing where you

383
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:36,960
hooked it to your head and then it you know you blink in it makes a move left

384
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,440
you lift your right that's retarded retarded please don't all right all

385
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:49,720
right Duke Nukem forever forever before it comes out the message boards on Duke

386
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:57,680
Nukem Forever's website located on their message board they're teasing it

387
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,800
15 enemies supposed to be showing up in there they and they're pre they're

388
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:06,080
saying they're swearing a ton is done we have hundreds of props you can place in

389
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,040
the world and the artists just continue to pump stuff out all right they're

390
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:17,720
saying they're gonna show it at next year's e3 huh yeah yeah yeah yeah let's

391
00:22:17,720 --> 00:22:22,760
see the goods people let's see the goods but it makes me sad we haven't had a Duke

392
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,840
Duke Nukem yeah it's like phantom where'd the phantom go that's right it's

393
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:32,760
not in the trash all right yeah but the gizmondo is still hanging about all

394
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:38,120
right let's get to the advice column because you know if we sat here and we

395
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:42,640
talked about games all day long we'd have no time to go out and go to golf

396
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:53,200
clubs so we have we have to fill your heads with useless or useless I'm sorry

397
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:59,880
solid information bad MC tonight yeah useful knowledge that you can use out

398
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,480
there in the real world so go outside once in a while or use the games here

399
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:11,680
you go dark sacral what are we learning about tonight today's advice is how to

400
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:17,560
survive in whitewater rapids after falling out of your raft. Number one, if

401
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:20,960
you were thrown from the raft, lie on your back face up with your feet facing

402
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:27,480
downstream. Two, if your raft is still accessible swim for it and hold on. Even

403
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,280
if it is upside down it can still provide protection from rocks and other

404
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:36,040
obstacles. Three, be aware of the current and of river conditions. If you get to a

405
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:40,240
calm area between rapids vigorously swim for the shore.

406
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:41,240
4.

407
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,000
Be prepared for a hole in the river where water recirculates, creating a whirlpool that

408
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,800
can pull you under.

409
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:52,160
If you are caught in a hole, plunge your feet down as far as you can and actively swim to

410
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,160
the bottom.

411
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,400
You will soon be pulled from the hole by the current.

412
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:58,000
But my final piece of advice?

413
00:23:58,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

414
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,040
Just don't go whitewater rafting.

415
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,160
Go like hiking or something.

416
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,160
At least the bears are kinder.

417
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,160
Thank you for that.

418
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,160
Remember, the bears?

419
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,160
Useful, very useful piece of information.

420
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,160
Everybody on the internet can use.

421
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:16,160
The bears are more afraid of you than they are of them.

422
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,160
Yeah, sit those sticks at them.

423
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:22,160
Loki, you were playing the Matrix online for what, like a week?

424
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,160
Yup.

425
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:26,160
You were a big fan of the Matrix movies, even the second and third ones, right?

426
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,160
I still watch them.

427
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:33,160
I would have liked the second movie to have been what I read as the preview script.

428
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:39,880
But apparently they they punked it down. Yeah, so how do you feel about this in the matrix online this week?

429
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,360
They offed Morpheus

430
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,880
I think it's too early to be doing this to be honest because I mean granted the game everyone loved

431
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,340
You know the fact that you know

432
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,440
The main characters were in it and stuff and I thought that they could drag down longer

433
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:59,340
But it just giving the you know, the basic description of what happened, you know, apparently it looks like I guess Morpheus

434
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:02,520
I got it. Oh, you got it. Okay. Well anyways Morpheus is basically

435
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:07,400
one of the plot lines, or storylines through this, is he's searching for Neo's body.

436
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,760
He's trying to get Neo back, because I think he thinks he's alive or something like that.

437
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:15,080
Anyways, so he's trying to recover Neo's body from the machines, but when the machines refused

438
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:19,880
to return Neo's remains, Morpheus began rampaging through Mega City, which is the city that

439
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:25,840
this all takes place in, detonating code bombs strong enough to threaten the Matrix itself.

440
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,520
The machines responded by sending an assassin after Morpheus.

441
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:32,880
the assassin succeeded and Morpheus was killed.

442
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,640
And basically now there's a new story arc, I guess, where players in the game are now

443
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:44,080
able to investigate the circumstances of Morpheus' death and participate in the new Matrix saga.

444
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,840
So now they're trying to figure out who the assassin is, I guess.

445
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:47,840
I guess.

446
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:49,920
And really there's like three sides to this.

447
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,780
You have like, you have the, you got a weird buzzing, sorry about that guys, alright.

448
00:25:53,780 --> 00:26:01,620
have the Zionist groups or whatever and then you've got the I guess the machines and then

449
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,620
some other.

450
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:03,620
And the one-armed man.

451
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:04,980
Yeah the one-armed man.

452
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:10,300
But basically what it comes down to is at any time during this whole thing they could

453
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:14,620
just say oh we're going to resurrect him and he's back so you know whatever.

454
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:18,500
I think it's a little early to do that just because I don't know how long they're playing

455
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:19,500
the run.

456
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:20,500
It was his sister.

457
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:22,900
It's always their sister that kills them.

458
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:31,100
Well honestly, okay, other than Neo, Trinity, and Morpheus, well guess what, they've killed

459
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,660
off all of them already, so who's left?

460
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,660
So I couldn't tell you.

461
00:26:36,660 --> 00:26:37,660
Jadapinkit?

462
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,660
No.

463
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:45,420
Alright, let's talk about this article.

464
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,080
I think this one's kind of interesting.

465
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,180
I was looking at Slashdot earlier this week and they actually linked to somebody's blog,

466
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,820
And this is on a site called corpnews.com and somebody is just talking about E3 and

467
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,900
I'm just going to kind of skim through this article, read you guys some quotes on the

468
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:01,900
blog.

469
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:06,620
If you want to check this out, corpnews.com slash node slash 37, title's called Where

470
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:10,620
Have All the Flowers Gone?

471
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,700
And it's saying E3 is no longer useful as a trade show.

472
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:19,000
And then the person goes on to talk about how they feel that it's just kind of inundated

473
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,080
with so many people there.

474
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:25,520
the folks that work at the Best Buy, the EB Games, the CompUSA, that it's become more

475
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:31,040
about these booth babes and showing things off, and that it's not very professional.

476
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:36,440
The only place that you can find the professionalism is to go to the upstairs area where it's nice

477
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:38,440
and quiet.

478
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:41,780
And they're basically saying that a lot of the game companies have gotten a little more

479
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:47,200
and I'm sorry, I'm paraphrasing, if you want to read the complete story, go to the website.

480
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:51,120
You're basically saying that a lot of the companies are getting very stingy.

481
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,040
Companies like Vivendi and EA will ask for a name right off the bat before admitting

482
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,840
you to their corporate Shangri-La.

483
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,800
Blizzard was running World of Warcraft media demos on the noisy show floor, and Nintendo

484
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,080
did not even have enough press kits for all media, saying, we only give those out to major

485
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,080
media outlets.

486
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,080
I got one.

487
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:12,720
Yeah, and I'm thinking Dark Sakura got one somehow.

488
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Major media outlets.

489
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,840
Then again, I did get mine on Wednesday.

490
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:17,840
Oh, maybe.

491
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,840
Well, we're a major media outlet, right?

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:27,840
Well, the thing is that, you know, once we get our paperwork back, we're gonna be up there.

493
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,840
We can only get bigger.

494
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:33,840
So, it's good that they're willing to give us, you know, growing people.

495
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:39,840
Granted, folks, we cover the news, I mean, the gaming news better than, like, say, you know, Fox News or something like that.

496
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,620
Okay, well, us aside, even though I love to talk about us as well, what do you think?

497
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,540
Is E3 still a useful trade show, or has it become a joke?

498
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:52,020
They've started understanding that it is the everyday people who are getting there, so

499
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:56,820
they show just enough to get them excited to, it's basically word of mouth advertising

500
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,460
is what they're trying to do.

501
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:04,560
And then, for the ones who are true media, they're saving the real juicy bits, like when

502
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:10,560
When I got to play Papakaros, or seeing the new front mission, that was pretty cool.

503
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:19,720
Or the Call of Cthulhu demo that they were showing, where you talk to their reps, find

504
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:21,600
out, hey, this is what's going on.

505
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
These are our dates.

506
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,600
This is what it's going to do.

507
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,280
This is what our business is looking like.

508
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,560
I do agree that that's why they have those press rooms, so that you can go up and get

509
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:36,220
Get figures, get the business side of things, get dates, things like that.

510
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,540
See the stuff that they're not going to put out on the main floor.

511
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:44,660
I really do think that the main floor is a method of advertising.

512
00:29:44,660 --> 00:29:46,340
But that's not always the way it used to be.

513
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:49,340
If you think about it, it's really ballooned in the past few years and I think that's what

514
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,120
this guy is kind of trying to say because he's saying he's been for like the past six

515
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:55,920
years and just he's kind of watched this whole thing evolve and that's what I think the core

516
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,180
thing is, is that E3 has really evolved.

517
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:02,320
I mean, if you think about it, even just like four years ago, did it seem like E3 was such

518
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,640
this big deal that, like, TV stations were broadcasting live and the internet was lit

519
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,960
up with talk and all that?

520
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:12,280
Sure, you know, you heard about E3 and you read about it in magazines, but was it really

521
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,080
such a freaking big deal as it is now?

522
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,760
I mean, now it's like the holiday of gamers, it seems like.

523
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,640
That's how things are and the companies are catering to it.

524
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,160
I think it's pretty smart on their end.

525
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,160
Yeah, it's interesting.

526
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Loki, any thoughts?

527
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:26,480
I agree with some of the aspects, like, when he's talking about, like, basically your fry

528
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:32,400
cooks of the video game industry getting into E3. Granted, there are these people getting

529
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:36,480
into E3, and this is why you have your three hour waits to go see stuff. It's because of

530
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:41,440
all these nobodies that are entering into E3 that have really no business being there

531
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,880
other than the fact that, oh, I work for a video game, or a game store, or I work at

532
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,520
a store that sells games.

533
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:52,640
I think that the retailers need to actually have some sort of signed release. If it's

534
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,180
not management, then you know, the general everybody else

535
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:59,080
would need like a signed release form to go with it.

536
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:01,140
You provide that with your credentials.

537
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,600
There's also the people though who get in once

538
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:08,440
and then every year they get their new invite automatically.

539
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:10,320
I got mine last, you know, this year the same way.

540
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:12,960
And do you think that's because maybe the attendance thing

541
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,440
is a selling point of the whole show

542
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,900
so they want more people to go

543
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,320
even if it's cheapening the show?

544
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:19,040
It is advertisement.

545
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,980
It puts money in their pockets.

546
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:24,900
things to think about. And there's still all those people who are willing to go out there

547
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:27,800
and shell out the three hundred some odd dollars it costs for a badge.

548
00:31:27,800 --> 00:31:31,460
I think there will be changes next year. I think it's inevitable there will be

549
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:33,260
some type of change next year but

550
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:36,340
who knows, I've been proven wrong before. Alright.

551
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,700
Moving on. I thought this was interesting. 1up.com actually ran this

552
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,540
story earlier this week. I thought it was cute.

553
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:46,420
80-year-old playing video games. 80-year-old Doris

554
00:31:46,420 --> 00:31:49,840
Self, living in Florida, for Lauderdale to be specific.

555
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:54,400
She is, I guess, the self-proclaimed oldest gamer.

556
00:31:54,400 --> 00:32:01,560
She was the Qbert champion in 1984 with a score of 1,112,300 points.

557
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:06,240
She was the oldest video game champ in the world at 58 years old.

558
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:11,280
Unfortunately, the claim of oldest gamer was lost recently to a 72-year-old

559
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,320
living in New Hampshire, John Lawton.

560
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:17,000
But now she's being motivated to get back into it.

561
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:21,200
She says she's sad when she lost the title she held for 20 years

562
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,000
and she got a call from gaming legend Billy Mitchell who offered to loan her

563
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,520
a Qbert machine

564
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:31,480
to practice and win back the title. So gaming grandma's back to reclaim the

565
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,000
Qbert

566
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,920
throne. I was going to laugh if she was playing Halo 2 or something like that, you know.

567
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:42,240
I'm going to get you! I'm going to get you in general because I suck at Qbert and I played a whole crap load of it on my Cliquavision.

568
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,480
oh me too can you imagine I mean it's it's bad enough getting fragged by the

569
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:50,440
12 year olds on Xbox live who then proceed to tease you and you know call

570
00:32:50,440 --> 00:32:56,680
you names can you imagine getting shot by grandma you know what unfortunately

571
00:32:56,680 --> 00:33:01,720
yes I remember back when I had my Nintendo and my mother played it more

572
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:07,160
than I did granted my mother is only 17 years older than I am but still the only

573
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:11,400
game I could ever get my mother to play with me was family feud on the Commodore

574
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:16,560
64 my mom was like freaking awesome at Super Mario Brothers yeah that's all

575
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:21,440
foreign to me my parents and she regularly kick my ass at dr. Mario but

576
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:27,720
it's weird because my dad now watches g4 because he loved tech TV and although

577
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,920
he's been kind of ticked off the fact that when g4 kind of ate tech TV all the

578
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:36,560
shows got lost he still it's like he clings to it so I think because of that

579
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:40,000
he's picked up all this gaming knowledge which is kind of impressive that's cute

580
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
It is cute. It's very cute. My dad's cute

581
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:47,440
Loki is this gonna be used someday 80 year old gaming grandpa. Yeah

582
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:51,960
Seriously, I'm gonna have like I'm gonna be the coolest dad on the block

583
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,400
I have my own goddamn video game cabinet

584
00:33:54,520 --> 00:34:00,360
How many dads can say that but I I remember the days before we had this hologram shit

585
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:05,720
When I am only having I'll be I'll be in line as the 80 year old grandpa

586
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:10,900
Oh, you're getting free kid fuck that gift for me. I will still aspire

587
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:18,020
To yell at kids who are taught or who are walking on my lawn while I'm playing the PSP or something

588
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:21,160
5.0

589
00:34:21,160 --> 00:34:23,160
My future they won't be wearing

590
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,200
All right, let me back my video game a last story for you guys tonight

591
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:33,860
We actually talked about this a little bit on the three-hour program on orange launch radio.com this week that airs Sunday nights

592
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:38,900
um this was too funny to pass up though for whatever reason games dot slash dot

593
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:44,340
dot org posted this story it's about what is your favorite word that's not in

594
00:34:44,340 --> 00:34:49,060
the dictionary and it was a poll run by Miriam Webster I think the reason why

595
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:56,620
the gaming site felt the need to run this story is that number three was woot

596
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:01,980
woot I'm surprised pwned isn't on there I'm surprised that too some other

597
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:02,980
Other highlights.

598
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
This list is retarded.

599
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:05,720
Number one, ginormous.

600
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,720
I use that word all the time.

601
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:07,720
I do use that.

602
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,720
I use it too.

603
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:12,020
Number two, confusled, confuzzled, whatever you want to say, confused and puzzled.

604
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:18,260
And lastly, one I think is too good to pass up, number nine, snurt, snow that is dirty,

605
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,740
which is a word I never heard before seeing that poll.

606
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:23,860
But then again, we live in California, so maybe that's what it's about.

607
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:24,860
All right.

608
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,860
All right.

609
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,980
I got a couple more, just real quick.

610
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,980
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

611
00:35:28,980 --> 00:35:31,340
You had a couple stories from another website you wanted to share.

612
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:33,720
Well, I just want to share these.

613
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:38,820
The Game Boy Micro, the brand new Game Boy Advance that they're getting you to buy, is

614
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:40,780
going to be marketed as a media player.

615
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:45,140
Honestly, why do you really want to watch movies on a one-inch screen, but whatever,

616
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:46,140
hey.

617
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,940
Okay, it's going to be basically, it's the Game Boy Micro bundled with the Playan adapter,

618
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,940
for those who don't know.

619
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:58,180
It uses the little SD cards to actually be able to play movies, and it plugs into your

620
00:35:58,180 --> 00:36:02,500
Game Boy Advance Player, or your Game Boy Micro in this case.

621
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:09,740
So basically, it's a $70 value that they're going to be marking with that, so yeah, two

622
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:10,740
inch screen movies.

623
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,660
You think that's going to be popular?

624
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:13,660
I don't know.

625
00:36:13,660 --> 00:36:14,660
I mean, people...

626
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:18,100
If you want to see what the Game Boy Micro looks like, you can go to orangejonesradio.com

627
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,700
and check out my pictures of E3.

628
00:36:19,700 --> 00:36:20,700
There you go.

629
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:21,700
Nice plug.

630
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:22,700
It's so small!

631
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:24,260
It is really little, though.

632
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:28,100
I can't imagine playing a role-playing game where you have to read text on it, though.

633
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,100
Oh man, I can't imagine.

634
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,220
Imagine trying to play Fire Emblem on that thing where you have to move your little tiny

635
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,220
characters on it.

636
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,220
I can't imagine.

637
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,660
Anyways, I don't get the Game Boy Micro, but whatever.

638
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:39,060
I mean, whatever.

639
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,100
There could be worse things, like the Virtual Boy.

640
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,980
It didn't look too bad.

641
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:47,060
A couple other things, now to go to the PSP side of things.

642
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:53,340
Heavy.com, those folks behind the wonderful stuff like Pimp My Weapon and The Music That

643
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:58,060
Sucks, they have new PSP content you can download from their website.

644
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:03,580
go check that out and that's heavy.com and also on the underground front here

645
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:10,100
they have the Rin version 1.18 which is the brand new Game Boy Color emulator

646
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:16,060
and they're working on right now working version of SNES 9x which is the Super

647
00:37:16,060 --> 00:37:21,500
Nintendo emulator to work on the version 1.5 PSP's which are all the US ones

648
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,480
because currently all the ones that they have right now only work on the Japanese

649
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:29,760
models the first launch ones which are version 1.0 that reminds me of the other

650
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:34,600
thing I've been playing this week Final Fantasy 6 ROM translated by fans that's

651
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,120
cool stuff I can't believe guys take that much dedication to put that kind of

652
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:40,320
stuff together that's awesome you know that I've been thinking about getting

653
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:46,080
back into that I had started on was second and said to three there's I I

654
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,080
couldn't get into that there's a fully translated bomb down to the graphics oh

655
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:53,960

656
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,480
the car ranger game.

657
00:37:55,480 --> 00:38:03,280
And the final story I will leave you with is, and this is my thing saying that no copyright

658
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:08,080
protection scheme is perfect, there will be a loader in the near future to be able to

659
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:11,820
play games off the memory cards on the PSP.

660
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:12,820
It's coming.

661
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,800
It'll be here soon and nothing's going to stop it.

662
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,640
