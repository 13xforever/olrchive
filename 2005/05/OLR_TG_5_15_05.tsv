558	3781	Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 16th, 2005.
4001	13829	Hello once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home, gamers, for what you really want to know about.
13889	15070	We're excited because
30711	37881	We're packing, actually we're very stressed because we're packing our bags, getting ready to go to E3 next week where we are going to be podcasting each day from the show.
37941	40084	So you can look for something on our feed Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night.
40484	46432	Technical problems aside, hopefully nothing comes up, but we think we have something worked out where we're going to be able to podcast.
47619	49221	DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Creaky, DismanthroatsGoing
66783	67624	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
93078	93599	Thanks for watching!
107876	122866	E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And if you send us emails to that address, maybe you want to know about a certain game that we don't talk about on Wednesday's podcast, send us an email there and we'll go check it out.
123166	126268	Now we won't be able to do every email, but we'll try to get as many as we can.
126488	129110	We'll go check it out and give you the answers Thursday or Friday's podcast.
129130	134273	So it would be a great way for those of you guys that unfortunately can't be there in person to kind of live vicariously through us.
134513	134633	So...
136462	137042	PSO Blue Burst Beta
158749	159450	PSO on the Xbox, GameCube, etc.
181152	182233	But overall, it's not too bad.
182333	188057	I do miss, you know, you don't have, on the beta right now, we don't have access to Episode 2.
188638	192701	We don't have access to, I think it's V Harden Up.
193686	198068	But it's kind of hard to bitch too much because it's free right now.
198128	199789	You can play this game absolutely free.
200409	204631	www.psobb.com And you can sign up for an account and play.
204671	206932	And it's free right now through June 10th.
207232	211254	And of course it'll be one of those things where if you want to continue, you'll have to buy the legit game.
211294	215576	But from what I'm seeing so far, I'm almost ready to quit other MMOs I'm on.
215962	218164	I'm about to axe Final Fantasy XI I kinda wanna try that too
239723	243110	Those games are going to get pushed aside for these new ones if nothing changes soon.
243190	244332	So we'll see.
244353	244834	Seriously.
245275	246617	So that was pretty much your gaming week, huh?
246898	247700	Yeah, pretty much.
247740	248542	Pretty much mine, too.
248842	249504	About sums it up.
250074	251354	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
274560	275080	I don't have MTV.
275100	275661	I don't watch TV.
301556	302678	DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
312908	318032	Not that much more impressive than Xbox One, but I think we have to remember we're still looking at prototypes.
318472	322495	And, you know, these are the launch games, too, so the system can only get better from here.
322555	324537	So I am excited to see what the future brings.
325017	330481	I think all the next-gen systems are going to look damn good, though, so they're all going to look near video quality.
330841	337366	So I don't think it's going to be a graphical contest so much as it's going to be a quality-of-game contest and...
338782	342365	I was looking at the new releases for the Xbox 360.
343305	344426	Now that looked hot.
344926	346067	They had screen captures.
346327	347248	What kind of stuff?
348869	349489	You know what?
350470	351030	Give me a second.
351530	357454	There was... You have to ask me when my brain's not working.
357494	360296	Particular games that you saw on a list that were coming out soon?
361457	362457	That's what I'm trying to remember.
362718	365700	Oh, like Ghost Recon 2, I think.
365740	367140	I didn't care about Ghost Recon.
367261	367521	It was...
370912	373193	I'm sorry, I'll let you think about it for a minute.
373213	377096	But a lot of the stuff that we found out about Xbox 360 was stuff we kind of already had speculated about.
377421	379322	The power button scan is changeable.
379802	385284	Xbox Live is going to have a gold and a silver platform, so that's good that Xbox Live will be free for some people.
385825	388686	One thing we're still not sure on, though, is backwards compatibility.
388746	390327	Nobody's really said one way or the other.
390367	399891	Now, there's rumors and there's screen caps out there that are supposed to prove rumors and everything, but we don't know anything concrete for sure absolutely just yet on that.
399951	402032	And that's one thing I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about.
403308	403808	Xbox 360, Quake 4
420931	422392	Oh yes, Quake 4, that's a good one.
422652	423652	And Perfect Dark Zero.
424293	424973	That was the one.
425713	426974	Oh, those are all very sexy games.
426994	428435	So this is going to have a very nice lineup.
428455	431016	Perfect Dark was a Nintendo franchise, though, wasn't it?
431056	431956	Yeah, very strange, huh?
432077	432477	It was on the 64.
433197	435998	But it was a Rare game, and I think they parted ways with it.
436018	441241	Yeah, Rare is, though, working with... Yeah, I remember that story a long time ago.
441361	442582	So, very interesting there.
443382	449285	One other interesting thing, I think, about the Xbox 360 that we heard this week, from Bill Gates himself, in Time Magazine...
450069	455613	He says, the next version of Halo will not, repeat, not be ready in time for the launch of Xbox 360.
456074	458836	However, it will be a part of the second wave.
459897	464661	The day Sony launches the new PlayStation, they will walk right into Halo 3.
466002	468484	Very interesting counter move.
468884	475669	Because Microsoft wants to get up the jump on next-gen gaming, which some say could hurt them, this is the interesting twist they'll have.
475690	477451	And I think a lot of us could have seen this coming a mile away.
477824	483525	They're going to release Halo 3 probably same week, same day as PlayStation 3 just to punch them in the stomach, basically.
484505	485505	Interesting tactic.
486386	492487	I think for us hardcore gamers that have money to spend, well, not that I necessarily have money to spend, but I'll find money somehow.
492687	494687	I'll probably get all these systems anyway.
496007	497187	You know what my house is like.
497507	505309	But the normal person, college kid that can't afford necessarily all these systems, it's going to make the decision kind of tough.
505749	506029	I think...
506994	512999	I think it'll really depend on Sony's launch titles, and I hope Nintendo's learned their lesson after the DS with launch titles as well.
513019	516242	They need stronger launch titles, because I was not impressed with DS launch.
516482	516762	Yeah.
517263	520185	But hopefully Revolution will have some strong, strong launch titles.
520245	520625	We'll see.
521806	522627	Very interesting there.
522687	527531	Speaking of Nintendo, Revolution is confirmed for 2006, although that may not be the name.
527571	528492	It's still the working name.
529353	530994	Revolution is still what we're looking at.
531454	530994	2006.
531615	534297	It will play DVDs, and they are saying...
534915	535755	backwards compatible.
535815	538516	They're already saying GameCube games will play.
538616	538856	Good.
539057	545759	I think that's a good thing, especially when you think Zelda is going to come out now towards the tail end of GameCube's release.
546359	548260	Zelda could actually sell revolutions.
548660	548960	Who knows?
549040	549620	Oh, absolutely.
549680	551441	And you know the Nintendo way of doing things.
551461	554822	They'll put something extra in it if you're on a revolution or something.
555082	557703	You remember like the color Game Boy Zeldas?
557783	559924	If you played them on an advance, you got a special shop.
560284	560644	Yeah.
560765	561945	All sorts of that kind of stuff.
563775	569399	While we're speaking of E3 and things that we're going to be seeing at E3, DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious, what things are you looking forward to seeing at E3?
571781	573322	The new Katamari Damashii.
575183	575644	Hopefully.
577345	578426	I want to see more on that.
582049	585131	Really, I'm just going to see what I see as I see it.
585571	587333	I've tried not to read into any of the hype.
588053	590235	I've tried not to look toward anything.
590315	592477	I want to go and I want to be surprised.
593437	594538	Saga!
615171	616832	Sega Z3 lineups announced.
616852	627756	They'll be showing Phantasy Star Universe, Gunstar Super Heroes, some titles for the 360, Condemned, Criminal Origins, and Full Auto.
628356	630117	Of course, you can expect to see a lot of this.
630497	634558	Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be the title they're pushing more than anything this year.
634578	636479	Yeah, but it's not Sonic.
636759	639100	I know, but that's Sega.
641055	641455	Curious George
664378	669899	Although what they've actually licensed here is that they've licensed based off the new picture that's coming out.
669939	675160	I didn't even know this was coming out until I read the story, but Universal Pictures is doing an animated film on Curious George.
675680	677401	I love Curious George.
677541	679081	And the man in the yellow hat.
680261	683162	You'll be seeing something from Namco in game form.
683462	685922	A game to coincide with the movie's release, no doubt.
686002	688663	That sounds fun.
689263	693224	I don't normally like games based off of movies, although I do wish they'd make a Kill Bill game.
693905	695526	DarkSakura, what is tonight's advice column all about?
724073	727575	Today's piece of advice is how to survive if you are stopped by the police.
728976	731098	Wait, how to survive if you're stopped by the police?
731999	732759	Okay.
733440	734120	Wow, okay.
734660	736582	First of all, don't let Sting open his mouth.
737002	737643	No.
738103	738363	Okay.
738903	740665	Number one, pull over immediately.
740825	743387	Put hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and cut the engine.
743427	744187	Roll down the window.
744627	745848	Keep hands in plain sight.
746249	748170	Make sure your passenger's hands are also in view.
748790	750952	Two, address the officer as officer.
751933	752714	3.
752073	752714	Tell the truth.
753194	755075	Don't claim you didn't do it, even if you did.
756215	755075	4.
756896	758396	Don't argue with the officer.
758957	764179	Don't give any reason for the officer to take an interest in your case, which may encourage the officer to appear in court.
764600	768361	Many defendants succeed in court because the officer is not present.
769761	770962	Choose your test wisely.
771462	778385	If stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and given the choice of a breath, blood, or urine test, choose blood only if you're certain you're innocent.
778885	782167	If unsure, choose the urine test, the least accurate, or the breath test.
782487	783707	Do not admit anything.
784408	783707	6.
784508	785368	Contact a lawyer.
785828	788549	If you fail any test and are charged, remain silent and call a lawyer.
789510	790590	What's your final piece of advice?
790730	794152	Final piece of advice is don't freaking go driving in Davis.
796869	800411	The People's Republic of Davis.
800871	802832	Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
802852	803232	For everything.
803272	803453	Well, I've...
819272	821673	You know, poor advice is practical.
821753	824754	Okay, maybe not for me, but maybe for someone else.
825154	828115	Never know when you're going to go swimming in a river in Brazil.
828255	832856	All right, well, that was actually some practical advice, especially when you consider that we're going to be going to L.A.
832876	833436	next week.
834357	835637	Yeah, we'll probably need that.
836017	837197	And the Rodney King thing and all.
838378	840298	Can't we all just get along?
841619	844540	Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a date.
844840	845500	This is neat.
846027	846587	I like this.
846647	849148	I like when things come out worldwide at the same time.
849589	851910	Japan and the U.S.
852650	854891	currently being, I think, rumored.
854911	860274	I'm not sure if this is confirmed, but it does look like we are going to head towards a near simultaneous release.
860614	862695	September 14th in Japan, for sure.
863015	864315	And I believe they're saying U.S.
864375	866036	as well is going to hit that day as well.
867157	869658	UMD, maybe not that same day, but shortly thereafter.
870325	871005	So that's exciting.
871465	873086	I'm definitely looking forward to Advent Children.
873566	876747	And Squeenix's booth at E3 I'm looking forward to as well.
876847	877287	Kingdom Hearts 2.
877747	879707	Even though I wasn't a fan of the first one necessarily.
879767	882088	And I know that sounds... Kingdom Hearts 2 is like hot.
882728	884528	The trailer is... I watched the trailer.
885449	886569	Actually, let me put it this way.
886649	888609	I like watching Kingdom Hearts.
888749	890210	I like watching people play Kingdom Hearts.
890350	893351	I don't like playing Kingdom Hearts myself because I get frustrated with the camera and stuff.
893371	895011	They were supposed to fix the gummy ship.
895211	895531	Oh, hooray.
895551	896351	It made it a lot more fun.
896631	899072	But it's all about seeing Mickey.
900563	901664	Oh, as the king and what have you?
901704	902605	No, he's in the trailer.
903205	903385	Oh.
903465	904806	And he's in there in the black gear.
906368	907969	All right.
907989	908069	Oh.
909230	913593	Also, speaking of black, Ninja Gaiden Black coming out very soon.
914514	917677	It's going to be shown at E3 this week coming out on the Xbox.
918057	921059	Of course, Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox was huge.
921880	925803	Some say it helped revive the Xbox and kind of bring it up into second place.
926143	927825	So very exciting about what is...
928524	930285	It's going to be released very soon on Xbox.
930786	932107	Ninja Gaiden Black.
933968	937351	So it's going to have more of an entry-level difficulty setting on it.
937411	941494	A lot of people complained that the first Ninja Gaiden was a little too hard, so that's good.
942394	945076	A new 50-mission mission mode.
945997	946878	That should be interesting.
947398	952322	And downloadable hurricane packs via Xbox Live.
953062	953723	Very interesting, huh?
955267	955527	Pac-Man!
985434	987556	I think it's Namco Vintage stuff.
987596	988557	Yes, Pac-Man's in there.
988697	989658	We downloaded Pac-Man once.
990038	992840	Zuma and a lot of those things you'll see on PopCap.
993140	995522	They released their 15th game this week.
996143	996703	Crazy, huh?
996983	998925	And they're going to be rolling it out into Europe and Asia.
999265	1000866	What do you think of the Xbox Live Arcade?
1000926	1002528	For me, it's kind of like... Pac-Man!
1003008	1005030	Yeah, but isn't Pac-Man old?
1005170	1007572	Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pac-Man.
1007592	1009113	He was such a retro gamer.
1009133	1010914	It was just cool playing Pac-Man on the Xbox.
1011355	1011555	Yeah.
1013809	1022276	If you have any feedback on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition, send us an email togotojo at orangeloungeradio.com Any interesting emails lately you want to share with us?
1022756	1023337	Give me a second.
1024358	1024758	It's alright.
1024798	1025959	If you don't have any off the top of your head.
1026159	1026559	Well, no.
1027440	1036067	Actually, I haven't really had too much of an opportunity to give much attention to it last week because, again, I was getting ready.
1036307	1040090	I had two weeks worth of homework to finish in a week.
1041691	1041912	But...
1043382	1064386	It was just, um, you know, for everybody that we hear from, uh, we have, uh, David, who, uh, who goes by, uh, WarriorBob, uh, email on, uh, on the 10th, sent me an email saying that he, uh, actually agreed with, uh, my little rant there about how parents should do their job.
1064406	1066027	Oh, yes, your rant last week.
1066087	1066707	I remember that.
1066747	1072028	That was, I got, I got some feedback on the 1up.com community, too, that they were, you know, they liked it, too, so.
1072108	1072308	Huh.
1073464	1078145	Well, you know, I know I get vocal, and I know I get really into what I'm saying.
1078745	1081166	And believe it or not, I'm not like this all the time.
1081846	1086868	I do get bitchy moments, but I'm not just like, all the damn time.
1087368	1089888	But that is something I feel very strongly about.
1091149	1092249	And you don't want to piss off Jamie.
1093389	1094030	I'm just teasing.
1094950	1096830	I cut you.
1097891	1102812	But it was cool to get that kind of feedback and hear that kind of agreement from listeners, and
1103812	1114520	That gives me a little bit more hope, I think, that people are conscious of this now and are trying to encourage other people to start taking responsibility for themselves and for their kids.
1115261	1118984	And also, hates Byright too.
1119004	1120585	I hate Byright.
1121426	1125249	I told my friend Julie about this and we laughed.
1125629	1126890	And we laughed.
1126910	1129172	Yeah, it's the news last week about Byright going under.
1129844	1132045	because Better Business Bureau shut them down.
1132285	1132666	Interesting.
1135007	1139129	This is the audio equivalent of me pointing and laughing.
1140933	1142494	Keep those emails coming in.
1142534	1143494	Thanks a lot for your feedback.
1143514	1144815	Yes, I will answer them at work.
1145155	1147076	I mean, when I get home.
1147636	1147996	All right.
1148116	1150117	Toogo, T-O-G-O, at orangelegendary.com.
1150617	1154218	I think this is actually really exciting news, much more exciting news than people are making it out to be.
1154899	1158260	iTunes is now carrying music from Final Fantasy.
1158620	1164222	And when I say iTunes is carrying music from Final Fantasy, I mean they are carrying, like, the Japanese import albums.
1164262	1166063	They're carrying the 220-2002 live concert CD.
1169364	1177150	They're carrying the original four-disc soundtracks for the later games, Final Fantasy X. They're carrying the Black Mages albums, both of them.
1177430	1178812	This is stuff you couldn't get in the U.S.
1178852	1180773	before, and now you can buy them on iTunes.
1181414	1189340	What I think is exciting about this is that this is hopefully going to be a trend, and we're going to see other game companies start to release their game music legitimately on iTunes.
1189420	1191962	Now, I know there are legitimate methods out there, but you know what?
1192754	1194756	Why not reward the people who bring us the music?
1194876	1202742	And, you know, sometimes getting the music illegitimately can kind of be a pain in the ass because, you know, people aren't CDing on BitTorrent or WinMX or NQ, whatever it is.
1203282	1209648	It's worth the 99 cents just to pull the song right away, I think, especially considering that these CDs cost usually twice as much to import.
1210328	1211209	So that's kind of exciting news.
1211229	1211889	What do you think about that?
1212110	1213311	I know you're not a big iTunes user.
1213911	1215572	I'm not an iTunes user at all.
1216233	1218254	On the converse, you try to download a 14-track CD.
1221164	1225246	and you end up paying $14 for this 14-track CD.
1226087	1227407	You know what $14 can do?
1228028	1229569	It can buy me lunch and dinner.
1231130	1235392	Instead, I can go out, oh wait, I already have those CDs.
1235812	1239174	But that's how much you'd buy if you bought it at the record store, too.
1239354	1245918	Usually iTunes, if you buy something like an album, it's typically not as if you bought it all one try.
1245938	1248399	So typically it's a discounted price for the whole album.
1248459	1249840	I don't think I've ever seen any above $12.99.
1254298	1256479	I was reading some of the British gaming news.
1257080	1259121	There's actually a game coming out I'm interested in.
1259181	1261923	I was going to ask you what's going on for our UK fans who are listening.
1261943	1263163	What's going on in the British gaming world?
1263323	1265725	I haven't found too much different from what I read last week.
1266757	1275760	I did, however, find some news that Hip Games is releasing Call of Cthulhu Destiny's End as a survival horror game.
1276180	1277320	Ooh, we like survival horror games.
1278001	1282822	I actually never did read any of the Lovecraft stories.
1283862	1286963	I do know of Cthulhu because I've played Call of Cthulhu roleplay.
1287964	1292005	And I'm actually looking forward to a Call of Cthulhu game.
1293331	1294632	S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
1321208	1322629	I know, I love Silent Hill.
1322649	1323610	Them's fighting words.
1324411	1329934	But if they do it right, because the Cthulhu stuff is like really freaking spooky.
1330315	1334278	I don't know, I still love my Silent Hill, I'm still excited about the movie, but I don't know.
1334758	1335438	Call Cthulhu.
1335658	1337200	Any release date that we see?
1338420	1339281	Are we going to get that here?
1339741	1339982	I hope so.
1340002	1341503	I hope that's not just a UK exclusive.
1341563	1343044	I've never heard of Hip Games.
1344064	1347026	Scheduled to launch in 2006, so this is going to be next year.
1347307	1347767	Hope we get it.
1348476	1359924	All right, and lastly tonight, with E3 coming next week and us podcasting from there, one thing that people always talk about at E3 and you see on the TV, the booth babes at E3.
1360264	1362226	DarkSakura, I know you're excited about the booth babes.
1362246	1363607	I need me some booth boys.
1364227	1365848	Well, this is interesting.
1366889	1371953	AgeTech has launched an anti-booth babe campaign.
1372654	1378798	They believe that booth babes take attention away from the games, and they want to take the focus back to where it should be.
1378878	1386943	They are refusing, in fact, to have booth babes at the show, and what they're going to do, they're going to hire ten unattractive women to work their booth.
1387743	1391805	Gee, if I were one of those women right now, I'd feel real good about myself.
1391825	1392966	I'd be kind of insulted.
1393026	1393947	I know, me too.
1394687	1400410	That's kind of like, up, I'm like, with the story, I'm like, okay, okay, cool, okay, and then I'm like, oh, well, you assholes.
1400751	1401011	Okay.
1402864	1403524	Well, whatever.
1404124	1406905	AgeTech, of course, they make video games and hardware for console systems.
1406945	1409626	They launched AntiBoothBabes.com.
1411007	1413968	All they have right now, though, is an order form for a free t-shirt.
1414048	1417989	But perhaps by the time you hear this podcast, they may have something a little more.
1419450	1424811	AgeTech's AntiBabes, as they're calling them, they're going to hand out granny panties that have AgeTech's logos on it.
1425171	1426072	That is funny.
1426152	1426992	Now, that's kind of funny.
1427032	1429453	See, that story goes like, cool, suck, cool.
1429593	1429873	I don't know.
1430593	1432374	Why don't they just have BoothGuys?
1433288	1434168	Any Booth Boys?
1434809	1435149	I don't know.
1435849	1436249	I don't get it.
1436469	1439050	Maybe because the Marines are going to be there, and they're considered the Booth Boys.
1439070	1440491	The Marines are going to be there.
1440551	1441051	Exactly.
1443032	1443512	Okay.
1444252	1449034	I'm going to try and get my picture with as many Booth Babes as possible again this year, by the way.
1450274	1453515	We have to make, like, the Rob and his harem gallery.
1454016	1454736	Absolutely.
1454836	1455276	You know it.
1457717	1460619	Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.

1490434	1490814	And that's it.
1490854	1496777	It's kind of a shorter show tonight, I know, but we've got so much we've got to prepare for and Loki's not here and everything.
1497537	1499378	We've got to do three, so I'm excited about that.
1500339	1500639	That's it.
1501099	1506142	My final thought would be it's going to be a wild ride and Disneyland.
1506723	1508303	I'm so excited about Disneyland.
1508483	1511965	Eating at the Boo Bayou place.
1512045	1512906	I want to find
1513717	1515177	The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room for one.
1515377	1517338	But the other thing, I want to find a place that sells liquor.
1518258	1519578	Even though it's supposed to be invite only.
1519618	1519939	I don't care.
1519959	1521359	I'm getting an invite.
1521539	1522439	DarkSakura, your final thought.
1522839	1523900	Reject false icons.
1524900	1526000	Alright, have a good one guys.
1526020	1528461	We'll see you next from E3.
1528701	1529181	So excited.
1530701	1534322	That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.
1534582	1541564	This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
