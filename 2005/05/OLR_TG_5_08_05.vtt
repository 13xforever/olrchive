00:19.440 --> 00:26.280
Hello everybody, once again, welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home

00:26.280 --> 00:29.680
for what you, the gamer, really want to know about.

00:29.680 --> 00:34.320
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky. Joining me as always, my awesome co-hosts,

00:34.320 --> 00:36.760
say hello to Dark Sakura, Jamie Summers.

00:36.760 --> 00:39.260
Yo, yo, yo, what up my homies?

00:39.260 --> 00:41.480
What up, girl, what up?

00:41.480 --> 00:45.840
Ceiling, Sky, my cue.

00:45.840 --> 00:47.920
Not your voice tonight, you're not perky tonight.

00:47.920 --> 00:48.920
Hi!

00:48.920 --> 00:49.920
Aw, that's much better.

00:49.920 --> 00:50.920
Oh my God!

00:50.920 --> 00:55.120
Aw, you're primed and ready for G4 now, thank you.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.360
No, I'm not on enough drugs, thank you.

00:57.360 --> 00:59.440
Say hello to Loki as well.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.440
Hi. How you doing, sir?

01:01.440 --> 01:02.940
I'm looking for this...

01:02.940 --> 01:04.440
I'm trying to find this one game.

01:04.440 --> 01:07.940
My friend at work was telling me about this crappy truck game.

01:07.940 --> 01:11.940
It's like this diesel truck racing game that's for the PC.

01:11.940 --> 01:13.940
Badass Mother Truckers? Is that it?

01:13.940 --> 01:18.440
No, it's not one of the main ones you would know.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.940
18 Wheeler Madness.

01:19.940 --> 01:21.940
It's not 18 Wheeler Madness or anything like that.

01:21.940 --> 01:23.940
But apparently the physics in the game suck.

01:23.940 --> 01:27.940
Like, for example, the truck you race against doesn't move at all

01:27.940 --> 01:33.340
So you automatically win no matter what your acceleration. There's no cap to it

01:33.340 --> 01:38.300
So eventually you'll start going like an infinite amount of speed. I've heard of this game yet

01:38.300 --> 01:42.300
I have no I mean I didn't like say oh I should remember this game

01:42.300 --> 01:46.320
So I didn't you know memorize the name, but I know what you're talking about. I've seen it before somewhere

01:46.320 --> 01:48.320
I want to download it

01:48.320 --> 01:50.120
I don't actually want to buy it

01:50.120 --> 01:55.540
I call that a Walmart game and the reason why I call that a Walmart game is if you've ever been to Walmart

01:55.540 --> 02:00.480
Which I'm sure you know most people have if they have them in your area if you go into the Walmart arcade

02:01.000 --> 02:05.640
Quote-unquote, what do they always have they have the crane game that you can play and then they always have

02:06.040 --> 02:11.840
Excuse me some type of hunting game here and deer hunter and then usually they'll have like an 18-wheeler game

02:11.880 --> 02:14.060
But the Sega 18-wheeler game was good

02:14.880 --> 02:16.880
But Walmart doesn't have the Sega 18-wheeler game

02:17.760 --> 02:22.180
Yeah, you know we don't have Kmart anymore to call them the ghetto so we have Walmart now

02:22.180 --> 02:26.980
I guess well there there are Kmart still around. It's just you know Kmart. I actually like

02:27.500 --> 02:31.420
Walmart except I only like Walmart in the south where they have Super Walmart

02:31.420 --> 02:33.700
You can buy your groceries for half the cost of the grocery store

02:33.700 --> 02:39.300
I'm I'm not big on Walmart, but we won't get into those reasons here on this program because we're gonna talk about games

02:40.500 --> 02:45.720
Sorry, well my is my favorite store you you want to read more about it read my blog whatever

02:46.140 --> 02:51.860
Let's talk about games and your games actually the games that you've been playing this week dark Sakura

02:51.860 --> 02:56.980
I played Metal Slug X last night on the maim with my man, and we beat it

02:56.980 --> 02:59.500
I think it's freaking hard, but it's kind of cool walking around as a zombie

03:00.300 --> 03:06.740
Sorry your mic was acting up there a little bit. We got you though. I need to discipline it. Get me a ruler smack that ass

03:07.460 --> 03:09.460
Mummy, well he played um

03:10.060 --> 03:12.060
Metal Slug X last night on the maim

03:12.420 --> 03:15.540
Dan and I did we beat it we beat it with

03:15.980 --> 03:20.360
Like authority and when you say you played it on the maim you mean one of those we have

03:20.360 --> 03:25.160
not one of those maim cabinets we have a pole position that we put a computer in

03:25.160 --> 03:31.640
and are playing maim on it with a hand-built um joystick rig everything

03:31.640 --> 03:35.160
that's awesome and it still has all the pole position logos and all that I'll

03:35.160 --> 03:38.880
put pictures up on it up on the web you need to be great um but we played a

03:38.880 --> 03:44.040
Metal Slug X last night and I'm hoping to convince them to play through some

03:44.040 --> 03:48.040
space Harrier with me because you put infinite credits in space Harrier and

03:48.040 --> 03:53.500
it's on because that game lasts forever or maybe some blazing star hmm sounds

03:53.500 --> 03:59.820
like fun anything else beside the retro um widescreen pong all right Loki how

03:59.820 --> 04:06.220
about you isn't it like scary that two out of three people in this studio have

04:06.220 --> 04:11.020
a main cabinet in there rub it in a little more why don't you know what we

04:11.020 --> 04:16.380
could do for you we could get you we could get you a one of those mini Mac

04:16.380 --> 04:21.420
things you know five hundred dollars get you a cabinet that they're thrown away

04:21.420 --> 04:26.260
for a hundred we could build you a main for under 800 dude I live upstairs or

04:26.260 --> 04:30.460
sorry do debt I live upstairs we're not hauling a very a gutted machine upstairs

04:30.460 --> 04:34.340
it's not that heavy we had a pole position machines all in my living room

04:34.340 --> 04:37.540
you know what a barcade if I want to get the main cabinet in here I'm gonna have

04:37.540 --> 04:41.940
to get rid of your chair no you know actually our next project is getting one

04:41.940 --> 04:45.980
of those cocktail machines the table looking ones now that I would have in

04:45.980 --> 04:49.940
the house. I would get rid of the kitchen table even though it's my roommate's and have

04:49.940 --> 04:54.020
the cocktail cabinet. That would be rock. But we're planning on doing that as our next

04:54.020 --> 05:00.820
meme. Sweet. Anyway, Loki, your gaming week. Um, I tried Super Monkey Ball Deluxe for the

05:00.820 --> 05:09.720
Playstation 2 and I'm here to say that it sucks ass. It's, Super Monkey Ball lends itself

05:09.720 --> 05:14.180
to make it look like, oh yeah, it's a cool kids game, people might like it. You go and

05:14.180 --> 05:19.820
you're like, what the fuck? This sucks. It's hard and it sucks. I didn't like it and it

05:19.820 --> 05:27.820
was boring and I just didn't like it. Then I looked at, I haven't really opened it up

05:27.820 --> 05:32.940
yet, Area 51, a brand new game, so maybe I'll play that. I don't really know. It's like

05:32.940 --> 05:37.420
all these first person shooters that are coming out nowadays. It's really a big whoop, you

05:37.420 --> 05:41.540
know. But I played Final Fantasy XI for a little bit last night. I played with some

05:41.540 --> 05:47.600
Japanese people and then I got tired and I didn't want to be you know giving them

05:47.600 --> 05:53.320
a 30-minute notice so I just fake disconnected and left shame on you hey I

05:53.320 --> 05:58.180
was playing for four hours I was that like one last original players you know

05:58.180 --> 06:01.640
from the party I'm like screw it you know I'm not gonna give them any more

06:01.640 --> 06:06.260
notice cuz I'm like falling asleep my computer so I waited for the you know

06:06.260 --> 06:13.080
the last thing to die at you know the end of our chain and I fake disconnected

06:13.080 --> 06:19.300
lovely so I don't know that's what's been what I've been doing that and a lot

06:19.300 --> 06:24.500
of Ridge Racer for the PSP and luminous again I've been playing Ridge I beat

06:24.500 --> 06:31.900
Pac-man finally and I beat was it I still have to beat the angel car a little

06:31.900 --> 06:35.680
bit I played it a few times and it's still really hard isn't the Pac-man car

06:35.680 --> 06:40.780
cool though. Not really. It's not as good as the one from Ridge Racer 4. Speaking of

06:40.780 --> 06:44.020
Pac-Man, I have to get this off my chest before we get much further. Did you know your Pac-Pix

06:44.020 --> 06:47.940
game came out this week? I know, but that's not the one that I was really interested in.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.940
Oh, I was listening to a previous podcast and you said something about the Pac-Pix game,

06:50.940 --> 06:54.700
so I'm happy to let you know. I want Pac-Pix, but I want the freaking Marble Madness looking

06:54.700 --> 06:59.180
one. Yeah, okay. Pack and roll. Pack and roll. Yeah. Because it's like Marble Madness. Sorry,

06:59.180 --> 07:04.220
Logan. Anything else? So anyways, yeah, just Ridge Racer and Luminous. I unlocked two more

07:04.220 --> 07:06.340
uh... skins today

07:06.340 --> 07:10.380
but as you know it really luminous it comes down to I don't have enough time

07:10.380 --> 07:13.260
to play it so I can't really get that far

07:13.260 --> 07:15.760
in the game but um

07:15.760 --> 07:19.380
I don't know, Ridge Racer I like it. I was actually looking at some maybe getting some more

07:19.380 --> 07:20.420
games coming

07:20.420 --> 07:22.940
out pretty soon uh...

07:22.940 --> 07:26.740
I don't really know what the hell it is with the PSP

07:26.740 --> 07:29.220
and the games coming out like for example

07:29.220 --> 07:33.100
you know you have Metal Gear Solid and people are like oh yeah Metal Gear Solid awesome

07:33.100 --> 07:35.300
Wait, it's a card game, turn-based card game, what the f-

07:35.300 --> 07:36.800
You mean Metal Gear Acid?

07:36.800 --> 07:39.300
It actually plays more like one of those old school strategy games.

07:39.300 --> 07:40.400
What the hell is this?

07:40.400 --> 07:46.800
And then, then, then you go like, oh, armored core's coming out, yay, mech combat, yay.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.800
Oh, I don't get to control them.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.000
Boo, that sucks.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.200
You know, I had games like that, or they actually had games through the PlayStation, you know, come out like that, and they sucked.

07:59.200 --> 08:01.600
You know, where you have to create the AI for them and stuff.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.120
that's not fun you want to play you know mech combat against each other you don't

08:05.120 --> 08:07.760
want to like oh i'm gonna program the coolest mech

08:07.760 --> 08:12.240
out there blah blah blah anyways so before i ramble too much you

08:12.240 --> 08:15.760
know i was looking too late whatever hey you know i was looking at

08:15.760 --> 08:20.800
mercury i might get that but you know yeah i'm waiting for smart bomb which

08:20.800 --> 08:23.440
should be coming out pretty soon yeah i actually did play another game

08:23.440 --> 08:28.000
what else i played the uh midway collection and played tempest on it

08:28.000 --> 08:31.120
uh wait a minute tempest is in the midway collection

08:31.120 --> 08:31.620
Isn't it?

08:31.620 --> 08:32.120
Yeah.

08:32.120 --> 08:32.620
Isn't it?

08:32.620 --> 08:33.620
It'll be Atari.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.120
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:34.120 --> 08:34.620
The Atari one.

08:34.620 --> 08:35.120
I'm sorry.

08:35.120 --> 08:35.620
Atari.

08:35.620 --> 08:36.120
Whatever, whatever.

08:36.120 --> 08:38.120
Yeah, I played Tempest on it, which was pretty cool.

08:38.120 --> 08:38.620
Cool.

08:38.620 --> 08:39.620
Yeah, you-

08:39.620 --> 08:40.620
Tempest is awesome.

08:40.620 --> 08:42.620
You just go back and forth, just like with the trackball.

08:42.620 --> 08:44.620
Tempest is awesome, but Tempest 2000 was better.

08:44.620 --> 08:46.620
It's all about the music in Tempest 2000.

08:46.620 --> 08:47.620
Let's see.

08:47.620 --> 08:49.120
Super Zapper Recharge.

08:49.120 --> 08:49.620
Let's see.

08:49.620 --> 08:50.620
What else?

08:50.620 --> 08:52.620
What was my gaming week like?

08:52.620 --> 08:58.120
You know, I did one of these interesting things where I bought a game without actually having the console.

08:58.120 --> 08:59.620
I don't know if any of you have ever done this.

08:59.620 --> 09:04.540
I actually bought a copy of luminous this week, even though I personally don't own a PSP yet because I'm poor

09:05.700 --> 09:12.420
My friend actually went and we were out and about the other night and he decided he wanted to get a PSP

09:12.420 --> 09:16.660
But he couldn't really afford because you know when you go to buy a game system you buy the game system

09:16.660 --> 09:19.900
And then you buy the game and the memory card and then whatever else goes with it

09:19.900 --> 09:21.460
So pretty soon you're making a pretty big investment

09:21.460 --> 09:25.460
You can't really get a PSP for 250 you have to put in 350 if you want to get you know

09:25.460 --> 09:26.580
Everything good with it

09:26.580 --> 09:29.800
So he decided he was gonna buy it all but he was only gonna get one game

09:29.800 --> 09:33.480
He decided to get dark stalkers and I'm like, dude, you can't have a PSP and not have luminous

09:33.520 --> 09:37.480
So I was like, you know what? I'm gonna buy luminous. I'm gonna get a PSP soon enough

09:37.480 --> 09:41.000
So I bought luminous like the sucker I am and so I let him borrow it. I

09:43.040 --> 09:48.440
Don't know if any of you guys have ever done that before but that's um, this is crazy me I guess I guess I had

09:48.440 --> 09:49.360
them

09:49.360 --> 09:54.240
Money to burn and I don't know why I would buy that and just not buy a PSP, but whatever

09:54.240 --> 09:59.480
it was a moment of weakness, what can I say, but at least I have a copy of Luminous now.

09:59.480 --> 10:04.040
Also this week I got to go to my very first video game premiere, which was kind of cool.

10:04.040 --> 10:10.460
It was a party for Red Octane's In The Groove, which is kind of, it's very, very similar

10:10.460 --> 10:15.780
to Dance Dance Revolution, and in fact if you are a member of the music gaming community

10:15.780 --> 10:20.160
you probably have seen these debates going back and forth, is In The Groove too much

10:20.160 --> 10:24.840
like DDR what all those arguments aside I had a really good time at the show

10:24.840 --> 10:28.800
which took place in San Francisco they really know how to throw a party it was

10:28.800 --> 10:32.360
great open bar and everything the game itself looks very smooth and made a

10:32.360 --> 10:36.160
great transition from the arcade to the home version I was very impressed with

10:36.160 --> 10:39.540
the new dance pads that showed up as well red octane's new afterburner pad

10:39.540 --> 10:45.960
awesome so I was pretty happy with that so if you are a fan of in the groove

10:45.960 --> 10:48.920
you're not gonna be disappointed by the home release what can I say and that was

10:48.920 --> 10:51.680
pretty much my gaming week not a whole lot else outside of that that I haven't

10:51.680 --> 10:56.280
already been playing and talked about on a previous show so why don't we get into

10:56.280 --> 11:00.360
some gaming news first off since we're talking about the music games and a lot

11:00.360 --> 11:05.200
of people know us because of our music and gaming affiliation that our 24-hour

11:05.200 --> 11:10.960
stream has over on live 365 there actually were some leaks this week that

11:10.960 --> 11:16.520
DDR extreme 2 and ultra mix 3 are confirmed and gonna be shown at e3 this

11:16.520 --> 11:20.800
And it's pretty cool because UltraMix 3 has some interesting new modes in it, such as

11:20.800 --> 11:25.620
Quest Mode, where it sounds like you're going to have a story where you go around and meet

11:25.620 --> 11:28.000
other DDR characters.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.240
Kind of a first for a home release.

11:29.240 --> 11:30.240
Should be interesting.

11:30.240 --> 11:31.240
Logan?

11:31.240 --> 11:34.960
Yeah, I've been actually asking for that, you know, I think it'd be interesting.

11:34.960 --> 11:41.240
I mean, I've played Quest Modes in all the weird games, like everything from Tabal to,

11:41.240 --> 11:44.460
you know, Gun Bullet 2 or Point Blank 2.

11:44.460 --> 11:46.320
How bad can it be, huh?

11:46.320 --> 11:49.400
dance dance dance bad I don't know we'll see

11:49.400 --> 11:53.040
I don't even remember dance dance dance old um let's see also

11:53.040 --> 11:56.640
extreme 2 getting a lot of raised eyebrows because

11:56.640 --> 12:00.680
the article that was leaked on game pro confirms that

12:00.680 --> 12:04.360
genie in a bottle and oops I did it again are gonna be in it

12:04.360 --> 12:07.880
and a lot of us some hardcore music game fans are like

12:07.880 --> 12:12.960
oh god oh god no oh god but we're kinda hoping that

12:12.960 --> 12:16.680
those are the only two really really commercial songs in it to sell the game

12:16.680 --> 12:18.200
and then the rest are gonna be like cool

12:18.200 --> 12:22.400
uh... new stuff you know from not well-known artists you know

12:22.400 --> 12:25.880
we'll see they confirm that it was a purple interface

12:25.880 --> 12:28.040
we don't know you know we don't know inside joke

12:28.040 --> 12:29.580
uh... let's see

12:29.580 --> 12:32.800
also red octane announcing not only the publishing in the group they're into a

12:32.800 --> 12:35.880
new harmonics game later this year guitar hero

12:35.880 --> 12:36.660
so

12:36.660 --> 12:39.580
now you can dance at home and you can play the guitar at home

12:39.580 --> 12:41.120
how cool is that

12:41.120 --> 12:48.480
And you can sing at home. You can be a one-man band, dance, sing, and play the guitar, but not all at once, unless you have multiple systems.

12:48.480 --> 13:01.760
That would be pretty smart. No, think about this. That'd be really cool. Land-wise, to link these games together for, like, you know, kind of like they did with the arcade with Drummania and Guitar Freaks,

13:01.760 --> 13:05.480
to be able to land these like different games together or whatever and be able to play like

13:05.480 --> 13:09.200
a song you know one person sings the lyrics the other person plays the guitar the other

13:09.200 --> 13:14.800
one you know does you know whatever you know a keyboard or something why don't they do

13:14.800 --> 13:18.640
that that this is what they need to be doing i i wouldn't complain it'll be kind of neat

13:18.640 --> 13:24.840
it's my idea pat and penny all right um let's get into some game news tonight uh starting

13:24.840 --> 13:28.280
off we'll talk about something music related not necessarily music game related but the

13:28.280 --> 13:34.640
other way around game games music that the music from the games they're going

13:34.640 --> 13:40.320
to be doing a tour called video games live this is being put together by Tommy

13:40.320 --> 13:44.720
Tolarko who you guys might know from the television and other stuff he's done

13:44.720 --> 13:49.520
music for games ready g4 man and the Clear Channel music group are putting

13:49.520 --> 13:54.180
this thing together it's going to be starting off with a July 6 show at the

13:54.180 --> 13:57.640
Hollywood Bowl and it'll go on some other venues announced in Denver and

13:57.640 --> 14:03.720
Boston they'll be doing some music playing Halo Metal Gear Solid music and

14:03.720 --> 14:10.060
then interestingly enough they also mention Donkey Kong and Pong. Pong didn't

14:10.060 --> 14:15.080
have music did it? I have no idea what they mean by music from Pong but it's in

14:15.080 --> 14:20.280
there so go figure. Also interesting to note Final Fantasy will have its music

14:20.280 --> 14:22.900
played even though Final Fantasy is doing their own concert so I don't know

14:22.900 --> 14:28.200
if they had the license or whatever they're doing they're being sneaky but also they're

14:28.200 --> 14:34.760
gonna say not only is it the orchestra playing the music but choirs and laser shows and footage

14:34.760 --> 14:41.900
of games freaking laser shows oh goody laser shows it'll be all it'll be like you ever

14:41.900 --> 14:45.500
been to one of those shows where they play Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon to Wizard

14:45.500 --> 14:53.780
of Oz no freaking lasers are they ill-tempered video games anyway so that

14:53.780 --> 14:56.360
should be interesting do you guys have any interest in checking this out I know

14:56.360 --> 15:00.880
I'm going to the Final Fantasy concert as is Loki the more friends does this

15:00.880 --> 15:04.040
sound like something we ought to be getting tickets for to or no no I'm

15:04.040 --> 15:08.960
going to the art show thank you and then I'm going clubbing and then I'm getting

15:08.960 --> 15:12.680
some chicken and waffles no but this is not taking but this is something that's

15:12.680 --> 15:17.560
in the country it's not just e3 so that being said would is it something if

15:17.560 --> 15:21.080
hypothetically if this came to san francisco would you go no if somebody

15:21.080 --> 15:26.920
drives me i would not go because tommy telarco is attached to it tommy telarco

15:26.920 --> 15:31.320
for me is like bobby flay on the goddamn food network and for anyone that knows

15:31.320 --> 15:35.800
me you know how much i hate bobby flay i will actually sit there and watch

15:35.800 --> 15:40.360
bobby flay's show and scowl at him the entire time even though he can't see me

15:40.360 --> 15:45.400
through the TV, but I will do it anyways. And I friggin' hate him because he's a little

15:45.400 --> 15:50.760
whiny bastard. And guess what? Tommy DeLargo is a little whiny bastard just as well. He's

15:50.760 --> 15:56.200
the Bobby Flay of G4. Are you calling him out at the bike racks after school? I think

15:56.200 --> 16:00.960
you are. You know, I don't care. That's fighting words, Loki. He made, he made, you know, game

16:00.960 --> 16:06.280
music a long time ago. Good for him. You know, wow, he had a job. Okay, now he's reviewing

16:06.280 --> 16:13.280
games for G4. Guess what? I don't care.

16:13.560 --> 16:18.560
Another thing that most of us don't care about but it's worth mentioning anyway, MTV's Movie

16:18.560 --> 16:23.480
Awards. Now you might be thinking, what the heck do movie awards have to do with video

16:23.480 --> 16:27.560
games? Well, I don't know, it's just like what the heck does music have to do with MTV

16:27.560 --> 16:33.280
anymore? Good question. Well, MTV Music Awards, I'm sorry, the Movie Awards will be adding

16:33.280 --> 16:40.960
a category best video game based on a movie that is great the nominees for

16:40.960 --> 16:45.760
best video game based on a movie spider-man 2 chronicles of Riddick

16:45.760 --> 16:51.160
escape from butcher Bay Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Van Helsing and

16:51.160 --> 16:56.600
the Incredibles I'm sure that the game for Van Helsing has to be a lot better

16:56.600 --> 17:00.600
than the movie I'm sure it was too I wasn't much I did not play a single one

17:00.600 --> 17:04.760
of these games no I take that back I played it like 10 minutes of Harry

17:04.760 --> 17:08.600
Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban it's about it because I have all my friends

17:08.600 --> 17:13.520
are Harry Potter geeks absolute Harry Potter geeks not that that's bad I'm

17:13.520 --> 17:16.760
just saying they're geeks I only bought one Harry Potter game and it was awful

17:16.760 --> 17:20.420
but it seemed like it was based more off the book than off the movie I was not a

17:20.420 --> 17:26.000
fan of the why is in Grand Theft Auto nominated because it's best video game

17:26.000 --> 17:27.600
based on a movie

17:27.600 --> 17:32.620
vice city was based on uh... miami vice now when he shown will have based on

17:32.620 --> 17:36.280
miami vice and it was also based on uh...

17:36.280 --> 17:38.140
uh... god uh...

17:38.140 --> 17:40.140
uh...

17:40.140 --> 17:45.360
alpachino movie uh... scarface scarface exit

17:45.360 --> 17:48.840
i think unfortunately it's a little bit of a stretch um... there

17:48.840 --> 17:53.620
thankfully they wouldn't they didn't do best movie based on a video game maybe

17:53.620 --> 17:56.880
Maybe they were going to try and do it, but then they realized, gee, what came out this

17:56.880 --> 17:57.880
year?

17:57.880 --> 18:03.100
Um, Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil Apocalypse, um, what's the other one?

18:03.100 --> 18:04.100
Was there another one?

18:04.100 --> 18:05.100
There was another one?

18:05.100 --> 18:06.100
The, the, the island one.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.100
Alone in the Dark.

18:07.100 --> 18:09.200
Alone in the Dark.

18:09.200 --> 18:12.300
And then they thought, we really want to give an award to one of these crappy games?

18:12.300 --> 18:16.820
Please do not, do not, I don't want to hear award winning Alone in the Dark.

18:16.820 --> 18:18.300
Yeah, that would be horrible.

18:18.300 --> 18:19.300
No.

18:19.300 --> 18:21.180
No, we don't need that man making any more movies.

18:21.180 --> 18:24.860
Speaking of movies,

18:24.860 --> 18:30.060
what do you think about this, Loki? The PSP UMD format has been cracked.

18:30.060 --> 18:34.020
You can now read the files off of the UMD disks for the PSP.

18:34.020 --> 18:39.180
And this is, let's see, coming off a story that actually in Gadgetran

18:39.180 --> 18:42.980
that they did this, and now ISO's popping up all over the internet.

18:42.980 --> 18:47.700
What do you think? There's three of them. There's Wipeout, the USA version,

18:47.700 --> 18:50.900
there's Ridge Racer, the Japanese version, and then there's

18:50.900 --> 18:54.020
some other tower of some...

18:54.020 --> 18:57.220
vampire chronicles, the gas tower.

18:57.220 --> 19:00.380
I already have the ISO for the white belt.

19:00.380 --> 19:03.500
Yeah, but what can you do with it? Because the USDs are in those little case

19:03.500 --> 19:05.420
things and you can't really burn...

19:05.420 --> 19:08.540
it was kind of smart what Sony did there. I bet they did it just to combat piracy.

19:08.540 --> 19:10.980
Well, here's what you can do with it, okay?

19:10.980 --> 19:14.180
You can take the files and try the reverse engineering,

19:14.180 --> 19:19.500
which is going to be close to impossible. You can rip some of the, like,

19:19.500 --> 19:24.240
I'm sure some of the graphics from it, but that's really useless crap anyways, you know.

19:24.240 --> 19:31.060
You can look at, there are individual files in there that, they're basically these files

19:31.060 --> 19:37.600
called ELF files or whatever, and they're basically like executables or whatever, and

19:37.600 --> 19:41.100
you can probably try to create something out of that.

19:41.100 --> 19:44.440
Basically the whole reason I think that they ripped Wipeout is because they're looking

19:44.440 --> 19:46.000
for the web browser.

19:46.000 --> 19:48.320
Wasn't ELF a band?

19:48.320 --> 19:49.320
Forget it.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.360
E.L.O., Electric Light Orchestra.

19:51.360 --> 19:54.000
Or maybe I'm thinking EMF.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.000
Never mind.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.000
Whatever.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.000
Anyways.

19:57.000 --> 20:04.680
But this is just a step, because later on this week actually, or last week I should

20:04.680 --> 20:10.720
say, right after this story came out, they actually announced that they had run code

20:10.720 --> 20:16.920
on the Japanese PSP, the version 1.0, because all the US ones are shipped version 1.5, where

20:16.920 --> 20:27.180
the hole is covered but basically this guy who actually has one of the development kits

20:27.180 --> 20:35.800
he created his own like you know hello world program and it runs off of a memory card.

20:35.800 --> 20:39.240
Any other interesting hack stories going on?

20:39.240 --> 20:45.400
Yes the Nintendo DS we've been saying it you know and there's actually you know the joke

20:45.400 --> 20:52.320
out there about installing Linux on Dead Badger, but now it's Linux for the DS, that's right.

20:52.320 --> 20:58.680
They have successfully booted a kernel on there, and for those who don't know that's

20:58.680 --> 21:05.740
like the operating system type of thing, and are actually running this shell called SASH,

21:05.740 --> 21:11.000
and simple text games are on there, so you know, all those old like, you know, things

21:11.000 --> 21:13.880
Zork or whatever you know that type of thing

21:13.880 --> 21:18.400
uh... but yeah there's some information on that on the mod gods dot com they have

21:18.400 --> 21:20.320
a whole thing on it and uh...

21:20.320 --> 21:24.640
I don't really follow the Linux thing that much. That would only be cool if Zork was one of

21:24.640 --> 21:26.480
the text games that they ported

21:26.480 --> 21:30.720
then I might consider. They have Zork as a 404 message

21:30.720 --> 21:32.360
I don't know but anyways

21:32.360 --> 21:35.940
uh... yeah that's what's going on there it's still you know

21:35.940 --> 21:39.400
I think it'll be cool because just because you can do an actual like soft

21:39.400 --> 21:40.560
keyboard on there

21:40.560 --> 21:44.560
using the touch screen and, you know, versus, you know, trying to

21:44.560 --> 21:45.880
type on the

21:45.880 --> 21:49.960
the PSP is just crap. Honestly, I hate to say it, but nothing is cool on the DS

21:49.960 --> 21:53.640
right now. Honestly, I'm getting to that point where I'm getting really fed up with the lack of

21:53.640 --> 21:56.000
quality games on the DS right now.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.000
It's sad.

21:57.000 --> 22:00.640
I don't know what else to say. Nintendo better impress me at E3 or I'm not even

22:00.640 --> 22:02.160
going to talk about DS anymore.

22:02.160 --> 22:03.880
Might be just selling mine.

22:03.880 --> 22:04.640
We'll see.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.720
Well, there are, there is hope.

22:06.720 --> 22:11.760
Bomberman is going to be coming on to the DS, and that's kind of an interesting concept,

22:11.760 --> 22:16.920
because they're actually going to have eight-way wireless multiplayer, only one game cart needed.

22:16.920 --> 22:18.800
So that's kind of neat.

22:18.800 --> 22:24.220
Because there are eight players, they'll actually use both DS screens during the game to kind

22:24.220 --> 22:27.980
of spread things out a little bit, because it might get kind of crowded with eight people

22:27.980 --> 22:29.140
on one screen.

22:29.140 --> 22:35.520
So it should be interesting, hopefully can restore my faith in the DS a little bit, we'll

22:35.520 --> 22:36.520
see.

22:36.520 --> 22:39.680
nearest school Super Bomberman 2 was I'll get I'll have it

22:39.680 --> 22:46.660
well June 21st is the date we'll find out all right um let's go ahead and let

22:46.660 --> 22:51.540
Dark Sakura present her advice column because you know we here at Orange

22:51.540 --> 22:54.780
Lounge Radio we're not just here to talk about games but we're also here to

22:54.780 --> 22:59.540
better your life because if we talked about video games all the time we'd have

22:59.540 --> 23:03.860
no time to go out and get our hair did so Dark Sakura it's your turn to give us

23:03.860 --> 23:07.860
What are you going to talk to us about tonight, my friend?

23:07.860 --> 23:10.860
Today's advice is how to treat a severed limb.

23:10.860 --> 23:16.860
Number one, locate any individual bleeding arteries on the stump.

23:16.860 --> 23:19.860
Two, pinch off the large arteries.

23:19.860 --> 23:23.860
Three, apply a tourniquet. Choose a strip of material at least an inch wide.

23:23.860 --> 23:28.860
Tie it around the stump as close to the end as possible so it will not fall off when tightened.

23:28.860 --> 23:32.380
tie it moderately tight tighten just enough to stop most of the bleeding

23:32.380 --> 23:37.660
keep pinching the arteries. Four, tie off the ends of any blood vessels being pinched

23:37.660 --> 23:41.300
use fishing line dental floss or heavy thread and a sewing needle if

23:41.300 --> 23:42.100
available to

23:42.100 --> 23:45.680
carefully tie off arteries. Five, clean the stump thoroughly.

23:45.680 --> 23:50.340
Six, loosen the tourniquet. As pressure from the tourniquet decreases check your

23:50.340 --> 23:50.860
ties

23:50.860 --> 23:54.620
if bleeding is just moderate you can remove the tourniquet. In order to preserve

23:54.620 --> 23:57.880
tissue at the stump do not leave a tourniquet applied for more than 90

23:57.880 --> 23:58.460
minutes.

23:58.460 --> 24:05.460
Seven, dress the stump. Tightly cover the end of the stump with clean cloth or gauze.

24:05.460 --> 24:10.460
Now my final advice though, is stop playing with those branch cutters.

24:14.460 --> 24:16.460
Clean the stump thoroughly.

24:16.460 --> 24:20.460
Well yeah, you don't want any axe shavings on it or something.

24:20.460 --> 24:21.460
Ew.

24:21.460 --> 24:23.460
Or chainsaw oil.

24:23.460 --> 24:28.460
You know, now I'm thinking about the end of Fargo and I'm getting all grossed.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.460
I've never seen that, but you know, they had on a...

24:30.460 --> 24:32.460
Well, I just wrote it for you, but it's alright.

24:32.460 --> 24:33.460
Like I'll ever see it.

24:33.460 --> 24:36.460
But you know, they had on the Darwin Awards.

24:36.460 --> 24:42.460
There was two guys' brothers and they had this bright idea that one would cut off the other's leg with a chainsaw.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.460
Hilarious!

24:43.460 --> 24:45.460
Well, of course he died.

24:45.460 --> 24:49.460
But not if he had heard your advice. Maybe he wouldn't have died.

24:49.460 --> 24:53.680
Nah, I doubt it. He cut through a major artery in the leg and that's one of the ones that's

24:53.680 --> 24:54.040
like

24:54.040 --> 24:58.940
cutting your, you know, one in your neck. I was just trying to promote your column over here.

24:58.940 --> 25:04.020
You know, but I still don't like stupid people to breed, so. Yeah, really your column will do no

25:04.020 --> 25:05.060
good for stupid people.

25:05.060 --> 25:08.780
So anyway. This is how to preserve the lives of intelligent people.

25:08.780 --> 25:13.100
Um, let's talk about another big story that was going on in the gaming world.

25:13.100 --> 25:16.580
Namco has merged with

25:16.580 --> 25:21.580
Bandai Bandai has bought Japanese developer and publisher Namco

25:21.580 --> 25:24.900
very interesting it's gonna be named the new company

25:24.900 --> 25:29.820
Namco Bandai Holdings and it is official as of September 29th

25:29.820 --> 25:33.540
2005 and I believe this makes them the

25:33.540 --> 25:36.700
third largest, don't quote me on that third largest gaming company

25:36.700 --> 25:41.060
well you know this also means huh that means that what we get out of this

25:41.060 --> 25:44.220
is a new Dragon Ball Z game with the Tekken 5 engine

25:44.220 --> 25:49.660
be interesting but I don't know I always thought maybe this is me personally

25:49.660 --> 25:50.540
maybe I'm just not

25:50.540 --> 25:54.100
giving enough respect to Bandai but I always kinda preferred what Namco put

25:54.100 --> 25:55.020
out so I'm a little

25:55.020 --> 25:59.340
sad that Bandai bought Namco and not the other way around. If you play imports though it's

25:59.340 --> 26:00.380
all about Bandai

26:00.380 --> 26:05.740
They put out all the DBZ games, Bonpresto put out

26:05.740 --> 26:10.600
this game that it's a lot like Guardian Heroes. Maybe that's what it is because I

26:10.600 --> 26:12.100
play some imports but I don't play

26:12.100 --> 26:16.380
a lot you know this means so hmm that in the next Tekken game

26:16.380 --> 26:19.220
you might have a hidden character that is Hello Kitty

26:19.220 --> 26:22.340
that's true you may have a

26:22.340 --> 26:26.580
Goku in Tekken if we can have Gon in Tekken 3

26:26.580 --> 26:31.340
just think about it. I'm not going to hold my breath for Hello... That's Maru in Tekken 5

26:31.340 --> 26:36.100
Hello Kitty fighting game the concept kind of

26:36.100 --> 26:39.980
scares me a little. I think it would be awesome they really need to do that

26:39.980 --> 26:41.380
It would just be cool.

26:41.380 --> 26:44.980
I choose Twinkle Stars as the Twin Stars!

26:44.980 --> 26:50.480
No, what would be great is to do the Hello Kitty fighting game and make it as violent as like Tekken 5 or something.

26:50.480 --> 26:55.480
The Twin Stars would be about as effective as the Ice Climbers in Smash Bros. Melee,

26:55.480 --> 26:58.980
and everybody hates playing the Ice Climbers. I don't know anybody that didn't play the Ice Climbers.

26:58.980 --> 27:01.980
No way! Dan plays the Ice Climbers, and he's awesome with them.

27:01.980 --> 27:05.480
Well, he's a freak of nature or something, because nobody's good with the Ice Climbers.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.480
But we have Ice Climbers on our nest.

27:08.480 --> 27:11.000
Oh, dude, that game was awesome. Don't get me wrong. All right

27:12.000 --> 27:16.480
If you guys have any feedback on our show you want to write us and tell us that you are a nice climbers player

27:16.480 --> 27:17.440
I don't know

27:17.440 --> 27:21.400
Send us an email to go to at orange lounge radio

27:21.800 --> 27:22.780
calm and

27:22.780 --> 27:27.320
We might read some of your letters on the show now one thing that we have been getting in the mailbox

27:27.320 --> 27:33.520
Is that we have been getting a lot of response from folks overseas actually. Yes, we have

27:33.520 --> 27:40.000
Yeah, actually as a result now weíre going to start covering a little bit more of the

27:40.000 --> 27:42.960
UK Europe news for them.

27:42.960 --> 27:47.960
So letís start it off, Dark Sakura you have agreed to kind of head up the UK scene, so

27:47.960 --> 27:49.640
whatís going on for our friends overseas?

27:49.640 --> 27:53.560
Well first and foremost because I know thereís been an issue of debate because for a while

27:53.560 --> 27:57.460
there was one thing being said by Sony and Amazon had a different date for the release

27:57.460 --> 27:59.120
dates of the PSP.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.960
Now both of them are completely in sync.

28:01.960 --> 28:09.360
The PSP will be available for 179 pounds on 1st of September.

28:09.360 --> 28:16.060
It's going to be a value pack that consists of the system, a pouch, 32 megabyte memory

28:16.060 --> 28:23.700
stick duo, a battery pack, headphones with remote control, AC adapter, wrist strap, cloth,

28:23.700 --> 28:24.900
and a sampler disc.

28:24.900 --> 28:32.120
You can also go to URPSP.com, Y-O-U-R-P-S-P dot com and order a copy of Spiderman 2 that

28:32.120 --> 28:33.880
will be shipped to you for free.

28:33.880 --> 28:42.420
Amazon UK is taking pre-orders at £179.

28:42.420 --> 28:47.040
I also do have a few release dates for GameCube.

28:47.040 --> 28:51.960
This month coming up on the 20th we have Fairly Odd Parents Shadow Showdown, an Animaniacs

28:51.960 --> 28:53.840
game with an unannounced date.

28:53.840 --> 28:56.040
Dude, they're still making Animaniacs games? I didn't know that.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.540
I don't know why. No one watches that anymore.

28:58.540 --> 29:01.340
Is it even on TV anymore?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.140
No. Actually, yeah.

29:03.140 --> 29:05.440
It must be big in Britain. I don't know.

29:05.440 --> 29:07.640
June 2005 for GameCube.

29:07.640 --> 29:09.440
Donkey Konga 2 hitsong parade.

Ah, very cool.

29:10.140 --> 29:12.840
Medal of Honor, European assault.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.340
Killer 7, Batman Begins.

29:15.340 --> 29:19.040
Something struck me as ironic about the European assault game.

29:19.040 --> 29:20.140
Why do you think I snorted?

29:20.140 --> 29:20.440
Yeah, I know.

Yeah, which I have to get because I am a Puyo Puyo fangirl.

30:53.200 --> 30:56.760
Now see, this is the nice thing for you folks overseas now, you know, whereas for us

30:56.760 --> 30:57.440
in

30:57.440 --> 31:01.820
here in America it's kinda interesting to hear the delay of games

31:01.820 --> 31:04.560
unfortunately, you know, sometimes we bitch and complain about how long games

31:04.560 --> 31:07.880
take to come over from Japan, but man, you know, you're in Britain, you gotta wait for the

31:07.880 --> 31:09.720
PAL translation and everything, it takes forever.

31:09.720 --> 31:13.420
So we kinda get to hear about that, but it's kind of interesting if you're on the

31:13.420 --> 31:15.240
other side of it and you're in Britain listening to this,

31:15.240 --> 31:18.920
we can already tell you which games suck so just skip them and I'm telling you

31:18.920 --> 31:23.080

33:09.940 --> 33:13.580
our email. Yes. We actually did get some good email.

33:13.580 --> 33:18.180
Lee wrote in and said that we make his LA drive a lot easier to deal with.

33:18.180 --> 33:22.580
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much. And also heard from

33:22.580 --> 33:26.940
Tommy who says he enjoys our podcasts and

33:26.940 --> 33:31.160
you know, that we hold his attention. So hey, if we can hold your attention...

33:31.160 --> 33:37.760
if we can distract a gamer from the games just for long enough that totally

33:37.760 --> 33:41.160
is awesome yeah great you for writing in thank you we appreciate the support you

33:41.160 --> 33:46.600
guys are awesome that's great all right um let's see the Xbox 360 we've got news

33:46.600 --> 33:51.500
on that it is coming out in November basically what happened is that Bill

33:51.500 --> 33:54.320
Gates was kind of the one that accidentally spilled the news on that a

33:54.320 --> 34:00.720
little bit MTV's confirming it November is the month for the Xbox 360 and early

34:00.720 --> 34:05.540
Pictures have been leaked and are hitting the internet. Of course that MTV special is this week

34:05.760 --> 34:11.520
I probably won't be watching because you know, I we're we're lucky enough to get to go to e3 next week

34:11.520 --> 34:13.280
So let's check it out then

34:13.280 --> 34:18.520
but see folks on honestly if they've they've made the console bigger

34:21.160 --> 34:28.200
But why it's it's white and virginal it is it is bigger it looks the size of now

34:28.200 --> 34:35.200
now my Comcast receiver and that sucker is huge. I mean, that's like, this is like one

34:35.260 --> 34:42.260
and a half Xbox size-wise. It's almost, it is almost the size of a PC case. Alright.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.600
Well, we'll see what happens with that.

34:46.600 --> 34:47.960
That's maybe because it is a PC.

34:47.960 --> 34:54.100
Oh, and guess what? They came up with a brand new original idea for a webcam. My ad is very

34:54.100 --> 35:01.360
ugly and their brand new controller has like a trackball in it there's some

35:01.360 --> 35:05.860
people are seeing trackballs some people are thinking it might be a gyroscope oh

35:05.860 --> 35:09.580
that'd be kind of weird so when you tilt the controller does weird shit but

35:09.580 --> 35:12.880
honestly I think it's just a little stupid logo thing that probably does

35:12.880 --> 35:19.320
nothing all right let's move on and talk about a story that affects us we

35:19.320 --> 35:22.540
actually based our show out of California there's an interesting build

35:22.540 --> 35:28.100
going on in California, it will ban the sale of violent video games to minors, and the

35:28.100 --> 35:33.580
law so far has passed review by a 6-4 vote, which means now it goes to the assembly.

35:33.580 --> 35:37.600
After the assembly, it goes to the Senate, and if it passes both there, which we kind

35:37.600 --> 35:43.620
of expect it will, it means that it will be illegal to sell violent video games to minors.

35:43.620 --> 35:45.620
You know what?

35:45.620 --> 35:48.060
It's ridiculous.

35:48.060 --> 35:52.940
All this is, is another example of parents not doing their damn jobs and expecting the

35:52.940 --> 35:55.600
government to do it for them.

35:55.600 --> 35:58.580
That's the only reason this is going to pass is because of their lazy asses.

35:58.580 --> 35:59.580
They're wanting...

35:59.580 --> 36:00.780
That's why we have censorship.

36:00.780 --> 36:05.820
That's why the FCC is as rampant as it is these days, is because they do not want to

36:05.820 --> 36:08.060
take responsibility.

36:08.060 --> 36:12.080
If you're going to breed a child, they need to make you sign a fucking contract that says,

36:12.080 --> 36:18.520
I am going to raise my child and have some type of control over what they do.

36:18.520 --> 36:22.480
That's what being a parent is, it's not about lobbying the government to do it for you.

36:22.480 --> 36:24.440
That's called being fucking lazy.

36:24.440 --> 36:30.160
I don't have a, I don't know, I'm like, I totally see that point of it, and I'm not

36:30.160 --> 36:33.360
saying this is something that like needs to happen, but it's kind of one of those things

36:33.360 --> 36:37.400
where it's like it doesn't totally bug me because, you know, we shouldn't sell violent

36:37.400 --> 36:43.960
video games to minors, but I think you're right, where the parents have to really have

36:43.960 --> 36:48.360
a more active role in what their minors are buying, really, so...

36:48.360 --> 36:53.800
You know, it's good, I think having the rating system is good, because then you're giving

36:53.800 --> 36:58.520
them a way to understand what type of game it is that they're purchasing for their child.

36:58.520 --> 37:01.880
But I find it very interesting that they will pass a law for this, however, they've never

37:01.880 --> 37:08.200
passed a law that says a movie theater must make sure that there is a child 17

37:08.200 --> 37:12.440
or when a child 17 or younger is coming in there is a guardian with them or they

37:12.440 --> 37:16.040
will be arrested because that crap happens all the time where kids get into

37:16.040 --> 37:19.240
R-rated movies so why are you picking on the video game industry I don't know

37:19.240 --> 37:23.440
maybe there is a law on the books but you and I know nobody enforces that law

37:23.440 --> 37:27.080
when we were kids we got an R-rated movies all the time but the thing is is

37:27.080 --> 37:33.640
And this actually is directly affecting, you know, my life because my fiance manages a

37:33.640 --> 37:35.360
GameStop.

37:35.360 --> 37:41.000
You know, what if some kid comes in and one of his employees sells the game and then it

37:41.000 --> 37:45.440
gets back to GameStop corporate when their parent raises a big fit on it and they fire,

37:45.440 --> 37:46.440
you know, him as the manager.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.440
Yeah, it's just...

37:47.440 --> 37:53.560
You know, this is just more of a case of people sticking their nose where it doesn't belong.

37:53.560 --> 37:56.640
You know, if you want to stick your nose somewhere, shove it right back up your ass where it's

37:56.640 --> 38:01.800
been for the last 50 years it's a very passionate subject for you all right

38:01.800 --> 38:06.200
we'll probably get some emails on that one good job all right I welcome emails

38:06.200 --> 38:11.720
on that okay all right just I want to hear from your parents and I will tell

38:11.720 --> 38:16.500
them exactly how I feel and why they're being retards happy Mother's Day by the

38:16.500 --> 38:23.760
way happy Mother's Day all right um let's move on to just a couple of last

38:23.760 --> 38:28.540
stories here ever quest 2 is expanding there's a brand new expansion pack

38:28.540 --> 38:34.800
coming out called desert of flames ooh 40 new creatures 12 new zones and you

38:34.800 --> 38:39.780
can advance to level 60 30 bucks for this pack coming out September 12th the

38:39.780 --> 38:42.940
only reason I bring this up is because I wanted to mention that I saw ever quest

38:42.940 --> 38:48.620
2 for sale at a big store here the other day and it was only 20 bucks and I was

38:48.620 --> 38:54.260
kinda tempted and then I was like dude it's ever quest I know that's how they

38:54.260 --> 38:58.020
get you but you know before we know you'll be slash pizza eating all the

38:58.020 --> 39:01.460
time you know the MMO I really want to check out because people are not

39:01.460 --> 39:04.300
shutting up about this and everybody I've talked to says it's fabulous

39:04.300 --> 39:10.540
Guild Wars I kind of want to play world of war crack yeah I've heard things

39:10.540 --> 39:14.780

39:14.780 --> 39:18.380
say I'm kind of sort of interested you know what I'm just waiting for Ragnarok

39:18.380 --> 39:20.180
two to come out and I'll be happy.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.140
We'll see.

39:22.140 --> 39:25.380
And lastly, one last story.

39:25.380 --> 39:30.200
Dark Sakura, we've talked about import gaming, especially on our live three-hour program

39:30.200 --> 39:33.260
that we have Sunday nights over on OrangeLawsRadio.com.

39:33.260 --> 39:36.980
We've talked about places where you should buy import games and places where you should

39:36.980 --> 39:40.580
not buy import games because we're into import gaming.

39:40.580 --> 39:43.820
What types of sites on the internet would you recommend?

39:43.820 --> 39:46.340
And keep in mind we're not being sponsored by anybody.

39:46.340 --> 39:48.880
This is just personal opinion.

39:48.880 --> 39:49.880
What sites would you recommend?

39:49.880 --> 39:53.500
NCSX, first and foremost, Japan Video Games.

39:53.500 --> 39:55.100
Play Asia has been decent to me.

39:55.100 --> 39:57.740
I do know people who have had problems with them.

39:57.740 --> 40:04.660
I actually have had good experience with Lixang, too, but NCSX just sits at the top of all

40:04.660 --> 40:05.660
of them.

40:05.660 --> 40:08.060
Japan Video Games is another pretty good one.

40:08.060 --> 40:11.480
It's where I ordered my Beatmania to, not my Drawmania.

40:11.480 --> 40:14.820
They're the only import company I've bought from, actually, and I don't have any complaints.

40:14.820 --> 40:15.820
They're good.

40:15.820 --> 40:20.780
Okay, but if you say there was one that you would never recommend to anybody and you would

40:20.780 --> 40:23.020
say forget it, don't ever do this, what would you say?

40:23.020 --> 40:24.020
Buy right.

40:24.020 --> 40:25.020
And why?

40:25.020 --> 40:29.860
They have stolen money from me, not delivered, promised product.

40:29.860 --> 40:35.940
I ordered and I specified Japanese Tekken 4, they sent me the Asian release and then

40:35.940 --> 40:38.940
when I emailed them and said, we didn't make any such promise.

40:38.940 --> 40:40.600
Well guess what?

40:40.600 --> 40:45.140
The Better Business Bureau and the North Carolina Attorney General's Office have taken action

40:45.140 --> 40:50.380
against BuyRight Video Games and they have closed their doors and ceased operations as

40:50.380 --> 40:52.820
a result.

40:52.820 --> 40:57.300
BuyRight Video Games of course sold used antique and imported games and they were doing refurbished

40:57.300 --> 41:02.180
systems and stuff but it's interesting because if you check out the website fatwallet.com

41:02.180 --> 41:06.020
a bunch of people were just complaining about this, they've been complaining about just

41:06.020 --> 41:10.980
what Jamie said there, bad service, misrepresenting themselves and stealing your money.

41:10.980 --> 41:18.420
So one quote said that they ordered a Saturn and it was cracked, Soul Caliber didnít work,

41:18.420 --> 41:19.420
crazy.

41:19.420 --> 41:24.520
Better Business Bureau says this, ìBased on BBB files, this company has an unsatisfactory

41:24.520 --> 41:29.860
record due to unanswered complaints concerning delivery problems and product dissatisfaction.

41:29.860 --> 41:35.040
The Bureau has processed 414 complaints about this company in the last 36 months.

41:35.040 --> 41:36.040
Are you one of those?î

41:36.040 --> 41:42.000
Yep, no, actually, um, no, I actually never got my thing to the Better Business Bureau don't I have the letter prepared

41:42.000 --> 41:44.000
I'm actually I was gonna

41:44.080 --> 41:49.840
I'm actually hoping that they are doing a class-action lawsuit because I'm gonna get in on that

41:50.320 --> 41:57.560
Hmm. Well, this is interesting too is that on April 12th the North Carolina Attorney General's Office told by right video games

41:58.240 --> 42:00.960
Basically to request that they do not take orders

42:00.960 --> 42:04.440
inform customers of the business status and they have to provide a telephone

42:04.440 --> 42:09.040
number for customers to contact them in case of complaints well guess what they

42:09.040 --> 42:14.240
didn't comply because as of April 26th they shut them down good interesting so

42:14.240 --> 42:20.760
we say good riddance I want to email them and gloat so that's gonna do it for

42:20.760 --> 42:24.360
another podcast any parting words from Loki over there who's been kind of quiet

42:24.360 --> 42:29.440
this last bit of show what was the thing about the two guys that were making

42:29.440 --> 42:32.320
movie oh I ended up skipping that because we're running long but I'll

42:32.320 --> 42:36.040
mention it real quick Clive Barker John will getting together to do this project

42:36.040 --> 42:40.000
it's called demonic and basically what it is they're gonna be simultaneously

42:40.000 --> 42:46.240
doing a next-gen console game and film at the same time so John will it's

42:46.240 --> 42:49.000
interesting because he's been getting his hand in a lot of video games movies

42:49.000 --> 42:54.640
lately not just Metroid spy hunter and now this so hey better him than you a

42:54.640 --> 42:56.500
Ball as far as I'm concerned.

42:56.500 --> 42:59.080
Five Barker, that's just awesome.

42:59.080 --> 43:03.220
So this should be interesting, it'll be a horror action game.

43:03.220 --> 43:06.560
But that's interesting because in 2006 we should also be getting the Silent Hill movie,

43:06.560 --> 43:08.560
so we'll see, we'll see.

43:08.560 --> 43:09.560
Silent Hill movie.

43:09.560 --> 43:11.960
Alright, are you happy I brought that up now?

43:11.960 --> 43:12.960
Loki?

43:12.960 --> 43:13.960
That's fine.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.320
Alright, parting words?

43:16.320 --> 43:17.320
It's hot in here.

43:17.320 --> 43:18.320
Alright.

43:18.320 --> 43:19.320
