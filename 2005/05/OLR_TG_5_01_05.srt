4
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:20,965
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everybody again.

5
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:29,188
[SPEAKER_05]: For another week, we are here with the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, our podcast dedicated to what's going on in the gamer world.

6
00:00:29,428 --> 00:00:31,529
[SPEAKER_05]: This is information that gamers really want to know about.

7
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,310
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, this week we're famous.

8
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:35,790
[SPEAKER_05]: Famous!

9
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:36,351
[SPEAKER_05]: Famous!

10
00:00:36,391 --> 00:00:37,131
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know me?

11
00:00:37,531 --> 00:00:38,411
[SPEAKER_05]: I am so famous.

12
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:39,372
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Rob Roberts.

13
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:40,132
[SPEAKER_05]: You might know me as Sky.

14
00:00:40,172 --> 00:00:43,793
[SPEAKER_05]: The famous voices you hear behind me is the lovely Dark Sakura, known as Jamie Summers.

15
00:00:43,813 --> 00:00:45,114
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because I'm an internet celebrity.

16
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:47,374
[SPEAKER_05]: And the one and only Loki.

17
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:49,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Just call me The Foot.

18
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:51,288
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

19
00:01:13,405 --> 00:01:14,586
[SPEAKER_05]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

20
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,124
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, you know, they picked the most toned part of my body to take a picture of my foot.

21
00:01:41,384 --> 00:01:42,985
[SPEAKER_03]: Although your feet were kind of curving funny.

22
00:01:43,005 --> 00:01:43,746
[SPEAKER_03]: That was very interesting.

23
00:01:44,246 --> 00:01:45,267
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know what happened there.

24
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:47,569
[SPEAKER_05]: I was just... I don't know.

25
00:01:47,769 --> 00:01:51,893
[SPEAKER_05]: So big thanks to Sackbee for filling our media horror ego.

26
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:52,593
[SPEAKER_05]: We do love that.

27
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:57,757
[SPEAKER_05]: And if anybody else wants to, you know, help us inflate our media horror ego, send us a message.

28
00:01:58,378 --> 00:02:01,560
[SPEAKER_05]: They sold six more papers the other day.

29
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:02,321
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.

30
00:02:03,415 --> 00:02:09,716
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, did you guys know that last week we were 1up.com's audio blog of the day at some point last week?

31
00:02:10,076 --> 00:02:11,917
[SPEAKER_00]: We're even more of an internet celebrity now.

32
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:12,797
[SPEAKER_05]: That was just awesome.

33
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you guys over at 1up.com.

34
00:02:14,677 --> 00:02:17,378
[SPEAKER_05]: I think 1up.com is a neat, neat idea.

35
00:02:17,478 --> 00:02:18,778
[SPEAKER_05]: I love their community stuff.

36
00:02:18,798 --> 00:02:21,759
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not just saying that because they made us audio blog of the day.

37
00:02:21,799 --> 00:02:24,039
[SPEAKER_05]: I've actually been a member of the community for longer.

38
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,160
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's neat.

39
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,360
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very happy about that.

40
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:27,820
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nice to be respected by your peers.

41
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:31,401
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, with all these blogs and everything, I'm thinking about starting up a new one on MySpace.

42
00:02:32,245 --> 00:02:32,705
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, okay.

43
00:02:32,725 --> 00:02:34,426
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting up at Orange Lounge on MySpace.

44
00:02:34,446 --> 00:02:38,889
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, actually, I just found out today at OrangeLoungeRadio.com, we have the capability to do blogs there.

45
00:02:39,049 --> 00:02:39,829
[SPEAKER_05]: We just don't.

46
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,830
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I don't know.

47
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,610
[SPEAKER_05]: We may have to do something.

48
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:42,251
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, though.

49
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:42,531
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

50
00:02:42,911 --> 00:02:47,734
[SPEAKER_05]: Anyway, enough about us inflating our egos, although we have to take time to inflate our egos once in a while.

51
00:02:48,494 --> 00:02:52,336
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you want to help inflate our egos, you could vote for us on Podcast Alley.

52
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:58,399
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just do a search for Orange and then vote us on Orange Lounge Radio on PodcastAlley.com.

53
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,060
[SPEAKER_05]: And...

54
00:02:59,704 --> 00:03:00,845
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

55
00:03:28,101 --> 00:03:32,963
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I did play a little Luminous, but eh.

56
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:35,464
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched Dan beat Metal Gear Acid.

57
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:36,565
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, how was that?

58
00:03:37,025 --> 00:03:38,385
[SPEAKER_00]: He said that game was trippy and hard.

59
00:03:39,006 --> 00:03:42,507
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you think of Metal Gear Acid compared to the rest of the series lately?

60
00:03:42,607 --> 00:03:45,148
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not into card games, and I'm not into strategy games.

61
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:48,730
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like a real-time strategy, and I don't like those type of things.

62
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:51,030
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, you're welcome to it.

63
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:54,872
[SPEAKER_00]: If you like Fire Emblem and like Metal Gear, you'll like this game.

64
00:03:54,892 --> 00:03:57,113
[SPEAKER_04]: Fair enough.

65
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,125
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really it.

66
00:03:58,325 --> 00:03:58,886
[SPEAKER_03]: Loki, how about you?

67
00:03:59,326 --> 00:04:03,747
[SPEAKER_03]: First, I'd like to say Metal Gear Acid reminds me of Phantasy Star... Was it a 4?

68
00:04:03,907 --> 00:04:05,348
[SPEAKER_03]: Phantasy Star Online 4?

69
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,389
[SPEAKER_05]: It was Volume 3.

70
00:04:07,489 --> 00:04:07,789
[SPEAKER_03]: Volume 3.

71
00:04:09,230 --> 00:04:10,410
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, the card game.

72
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,670
[SPEAKER_03]: We all remember how that worked.

73
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,771
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it worked about just the same for Metal Gear Acid.

74
00:04:13,791 --> 00:04:17,153
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough, with Phantasy Star 4, now they're going back to what worked in 1 and 2.

75
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:17,873
[SPEAKER_05]: Funny enough.

76
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:21,994
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the card game to things... Ah, you know what?

77
00:04:22,955 --> 00:04:23,675
[SPEAKER_03]: Buy cards.

78
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:25,756
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to play a card game, play a card game.

79
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:28,797
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't play a game that's a video game that's a card game.

80
00:04:29,357 --> 00:04:30,958
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just redundant.

81
00:04:31,198 --> 00:04:31,898
[SPEAKER_03]: That's too much.

82
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:38,042
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, my week, I played one game, and that one game would be Ridge Racer for the PSP.

83
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:47,247
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went through about, oh man, like 13 of the World Tour things.

84
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:50,029
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm now on Pro 20, I think.

85
00:04:50,689 --> 00:04:53,051
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just unlocked the RallyX car.

86
00:04:53,948 --> 00:04:55,429
[SPEAKER_03]: by beating the minigame.

87
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:57,009
[SPEAKER_03]: We got 50,000 points on that.

88
00:04:57,149 --> 00:05:03,912
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got the Rally-X car, which is so awesome because the Rally-X car is all pixelated just like, you know, the actual game.

89
00:05:03,992 --> 00:05:07,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you use the Nitro Boost, it does these little pixelated clouds behind you.

90
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:10,915
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, just like it did in Rally-X if you played the old game.

91
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:11,956
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like the smoke screen.

92
00:05:12,236 --> 00:05:17,158
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, I think, it's just little details like that Namco throws in that's awesome.

93
00:05:19,069 --> 00:05:23,870
[SPEAKER_03]: The race before they had the race, what they called, I guess, the devil car or something like that.

94
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:25,651
[SPEAKER_03]: And that sucked.

95
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:26,491
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a one-on-one race.

96
00:05:26,551 --> 00:05:36,514
[SPEAKER_03]: But see, what's really awesome is once you get past Pro 18, it's all like kind of challenge mode type stuff where you have like one-on-one races with stuff to unlock special cars and whatnot.

97
00:05:36,674 --> 00:05:37,714
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are really cool.

98
00:05:37,734 --> 00:05:39,935
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been playing this game like all week.

99
00:05:40,015 --> 00:05:41,795
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's held my attention that long.

100
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:43,776
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a really, really good game.

101
00:05:44,436 --> 00:05:44,636
[SPEAKER_04]: Cool.

102
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:45,136
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything else then?

103
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:48,584
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I played this week.

104
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:49,824
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't played anything else.

105
00:05:50,604 --> 00:05:53,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I have kind of a different story than you do for my gaming week.

106
00:05:53,725 --> 00:05:54,686
[SPEAKER_05]: You were on PSP.

107
00:05:54,746 --> 00:05:55,506
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on DS.

108
00:05:55,986 --> 00:05:58,467
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up a new game called Polarium for the DS.

109
00:05:58,827 --> 00:05:59,547
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a puzzle game.

110
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,867
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been looking at that one, too.

111
00:06:00,887 --> 00:06:01,527
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you looking at that?

112
00:06:02,388 --> 00:06:03,508
[SPEAKER_00]: That and Mercury for PSP.

113
00:06:04,628 --> 00:06:06,589
[SPEAKER_05]: I picked up Polarium because I'm a big puzzle game fan.

114
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:07,289
[SPEAKER_05]: I loved Luminous.

115
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:08,469
[SPEAKER_05]: This goes back to Tetris.

116
00:06:11,226 --> 00:06:39,223
[SPEAKER_05]: Yoshi's Cookie and Tetris Attack and those types of games too so I picked up Polarium which is basically the concept of Polarium is that you have all these squares so at first glance you might think it's kind of like Luminous but it has nothing to do with it really their games aren't the same at all but you use the stylus you draw lines and that's how you're changing you're swapping tiles and I know that sounds really simple but because you can only draw the lines so fast you actually have to think ahead about how you're going to draw the lines so it sounds like a pretty killer concept huh um

117
00:06:40,616 --> 00:06:43,258
[SPEAKER_05]: Polarium held my attention for about an hour, and then I was done with it.

118
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,779
[SPEAKER_05]: I was very disappointed with Polarium.

119
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:47,060
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just me personally.

120
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,322
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the graphics were boring as heck.

121
00:06:51,322 --> 00:06:53,523
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought it sounded like garbage.

122
00:06:54,624 --> 00:06:58,886
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the puzzles were kind of interesting, but I just didn't like the concept.

123
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:00,347
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I take that back.

124
00:07:00,939 --> 00:07:02,700
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the idea of the game.

125
00:07:03,141 --> 00:07:05,222
[SPEAKER_05]: It kind of makes you go, hmm, could this be a fun puzzle game?

126
00:07:05,242 --> 00:07:06,903
[SPEAKER_05]: But the execution didn't like it.

127
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:08,384
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't recommend this game.

128
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:09,265
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't like it at all.

129
00:07:09,585 --> 00:07:11,687
[SPEAKER_05]: Especially when you put it next to a game such as Luminous.

130
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:16,330
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think this might be in some ways DS's answer to Luminous.

131
00:07:16,851 --> 00:07:19,292
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you think of it that way, you're really going to be disappointed.

132
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:23,535
[SPEAKER_00]: This is nothing like... I think Mercury is also going to blow it out of the water too.

133
00:07:24,056 --> 00:07:26,377
[SPEAKER_05]: Luminous, the bar has been set so high with Luminous, I think.

134
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:29,860
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking that Mercury is going to be pretty big though.

135
00:07:30,903 --> 00:07:31,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm curious about Mercure.

136
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:35,346
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm also curious about... I'm not giving up on DS just yet because I'm very, very curious about Meteos.

137
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:36,747
[SPEAKER_05]: I've heard a lot of good things about that.

138
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,948
[SPEAKER_03]: I want Smart Bomb.

139
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,329
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I've been waiting for.

140
00:07:40,349 --> 00:07:44,131
[SPEAKER_05]: But Polarium was just... Polarium is the type of game I would have expected.

141
00:07:44,151 --> 00:07:46,513
[SPEAKER_05]: You know how they have third-party publishers?

142
00:07:46,983 --> 00:07:49,005
[SPEAKER_05]: DS is going to lose this battle unless things start changing fast.

143
00:08:14,529 --> 00:08:16,109
[SPEAKER_03]: These games are not impressive.

144
00:08:16,229 --> 00:08:20,610
[SPEAKER_03]: I know at E3 they're going to announce that stupid internet connectivity or whatever like that.

145
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:24,351
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty solid.

146
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,351
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's going to happen.

147
00:08:26,152 --> 00:08:36,414
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's going to matter at this point because pretty soon the PSP's already got internet connectivity and they're going to have a web browser probably for that coming out this year.

148
00:08:36,594 --> 00:08:42,355
[SPEAKER_05]: If the revolution blows everything else out of the water, does the DS have a chance?

149
00:08:44,753 --> 00:08:45,433
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

150
00:08:45,934 --> 00:08:52,076
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to probably do a redesign of it just like they did with the Advance, and it's going to be another game system to buy.

151
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:55,337
[SPEAKER_05]: All they need to do is to start putting out some more of their franchise games that are good.

152
00:08:55,377 --> 00:08:57,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, the Metroid demo was pretty nice.

153
00:08:57,357 --> 00:08:58,618
[SPEAKER_05]: They should put out the Metroid game.

154
00:08:58,638 --> 00:08:59,298
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't understand.

155
00:08:59,318 --> 00:09:02,759
[SPEAKER_05]: I know they're probably trying to finish it, but... Okay, okay, here's what I don't understand.

156
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,900
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, yeah, you ported Mario 64.

157
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:05,520
[SPEAKER_03]: Good for you.

158
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,501
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you make a new Mario game?

159
00:09:08,821 --> 00:09:09,941
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is what I'm wondering.

160
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:10,922
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you make a new game?

161
00:09:11,142 --> 00:09:11,942
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.

162
00:09:13,424 --> 00:09:17,467
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I mean, they altered Mario 64, so it's almost like a whole different game when you play Yoshi and stuff.

163
00:09:17,487 --> 00:09:18,488
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get the Game Boy Advance, though.

164
00:09:18,508 --> 00:09:20,409
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it was for the most part, is ported games.

165
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,190
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody got Pac-Pix out in Japan, and that's not fair.

166
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Pix is coming out here very, very soon, though, which is exciting.

167
00:09:28,294 --> 00:09:29,634
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, let's... No, let's go.

168
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:29,935
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.

169
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:33,557
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, I still want the Pac-Man Marble Madness type game.

170
00:09:34,537 --> 00:09:35,297
[SPEAKER_00]: That needs to hurry up.

171
00:09:35,338 --> 00:09:36,378
[SPEAKER_05]: Pack and roll.

172
00:10:04,588 --> 00:10:05,889
[SPEAKER_05]: VIRTUAL BOY PART 2 VIRTUAL BOY PART 2

173
00:10:28,035 --> 00:10:28,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty much.

174
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:30,097
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have a migraine.

175
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,758
[SPEAKER_00]: You can pay $30 for it.

176
00:10:31,798 --> 00:10:33,400
[SPEAKER_05]: The Virtual Boy was kind of a cool idea, though.

177
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,441
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it really was.

178
00:10:34,781 --> 00:10:38,244
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's the first thing my brain goes to when I hear about this revolution.

179
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:41,727
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a good idea too early in its time.

180
00:10:41,787 --> 00:10:42,788
[SPEAKER_00]: It had fun commercials.

181
00:10:43,288 --> 00:10:45,110
[SPEAKER_03]: The Virtual Boy, it was a great idea.

182
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,752
[SPEAKER_03]: Monochrome red, that was a bad point.

183
00:10:47,873 --> 00:10:50,595
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that it wasn't really that much of a portable machine.

184
00:10:50,615 --> 00:10:53,017
[SPEAKER_03]: You had to kind of sit it down on a table to be able to use it.

185
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:54,919
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the problem.

186
00:10:55,882 --> 00:11:09,368
[SPEAKER_05]: Now before you laugh this story off, consider that, and this is what the article goes on to say, consider that there have been recent patents filed by Nintendo that kind of support that this is possibly the direction.

187
00:11:09,448 --> 00:11:13,330
[SPEAKER_05]: Now obviously nothing's confirmed until Nintendo says something themselves, but speculate.

188
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,932
[SPEAKER_03]: I am going to say that this is probably the case, and here's why I think that.

189
00:11:17,776 --> 00:11:20,157
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been very quiet about the revolution.

190
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,337
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't said anything.

191
00:11:21,397 --> 00:11:22,598
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is what's going to happen.

192
00:11:22,918 --> 00:11:26,939
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have all this, like, you know, everyone's like, oh, PS3, you know, Xbox 360.

193
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,860
[SPEAKER_03]: Then it's all, bam, revolution.

194
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:39,563
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the Xbox 360 and the PS3, as far as, you know, improving the graphics and stuff, they haven't really done anything new.

195
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:45,645
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also Nintendo's been known for gimmicky type of things.

196
00:11:46,977 --> 00:11:47,498
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll be interesting.

197
00:11:47,518 --> 00:11:52,940
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking forward to seeing if this is true or not and how this is all going to play out.

198
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,242
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to say until I see it in action, you know what I mean?

199
00:11:57,463 --> 00:12:03,305
[SPEAKER_05]: The concept sounds interesting, although I really hope they've learned the mistakes from Virtual Boy and that this won't cause seizures and headaches.

200
00:12:04,186 --> 00:12:07,467
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wondering if this new 3D stuff, if we'll see a Power Glove 2?

201
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:09,769
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

202
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:12,870
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that Nintendo licensed the Palm OS.

203
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,231
[SPEAKER_01]: Hmm.

204
00:12:14,847 --> 00:12:22,634
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, actually, there's supposed to be making a cartridge to where you can run the Palm OS software on your DS.

205
00:12:22,974 --> 00:12:27,218
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be very interesting to see how the DS and the Revolution work together with the 3D projection things.

206
00:12:27,238 --> 00:12:28,920
[SPEAKER_05]: Will I be able to poke things with my stylus?

207
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:38,148
[SPEAKER_03]: No, basically what the 3D projection is, it's going to be stereoscopic 3D, basically just like if you go into an IMAX movie and you have your glasses projected.

208
00:12:38,616 --> 00:12:40,017
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're going to get with this.

209
00:12:40,098 --> 00:12:42,700
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be 3D with glasses, I think.

210
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:47,184
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're talking about 3D glasses, not actual hologram projection?

211
00:12:47,384 --> 00:12:50,567
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're a little early for holograms.

212
00:12:50,587 --> 00:12:52,208
[SPEAKER_05]: But that would be revolutionary, would it not?

213
00:12:52,268 --> 00:12:53,169
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it would.

214
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,352
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess, would that mean they would not need a TV for that or something?

215
00:12:56,932 --> 00:12:57,272
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

216
00:12:57,773 --> 00:12:58,173
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

217
00:12:58,233 --> 00:12:58,734
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.

218
00:12:58,774 --> 00:13:00,495
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, hey, whatever they want to do.

219
00:13:00,555 --> 00:13:02,437
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if they've got holograms, hey.

220
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:08,206
[SPEAKER_05]: Since Namco got brought up a little earlier in the show several times, I have a couple Namco stories tonight.

221
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:11,328
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know this always makes DarkSakura happy because she's a big Namco fan.

222
00:13:13,049 --> 00:13:19,853
[SPEAKER_05]: What is happening is that Namco is going to be releasing a brand new compilation, yes, another one, for their 50th anniversary.

223
00:13:20,313 --> 00:13:28,237
[SPEAKER_05]: They are collecting 14 arcade titles and putting it out on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, PC, and GBA.

224
00:13:28,298 --> 00:13:32,260
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in August and it's called the 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection.

225
00:13:33,052 --> 00:13:33,853
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, Ms.

226
00:13:33,893 --> 00:13:42,538
[SPEAKER_05]: Pac-Man, Galaga, Galaxian, Dig Dug, Pole Positions 1 and 2, Rally X, Rolling Thunder, and more, including Xevious, Mappy, etc.

227
00:13:42,578 --> 00:13:42,958
[SPEAKER_05]: Mappy!

228
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:45,760
[SPEAKER_05]: Been there, done that, with all this.

229
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:45,940
[SPEAKER_05]: Mappy!

230
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,501
[SPEAKER_05]: Why can't I just go out and get the PlayStation 1 discs?

231
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,442
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, what big deal?

232
00:13:49,462 --> 00:13:51,363
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they need to do what Sega did.

233
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:53,885
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, with the Sega Ages.

234
00:13:54,365 --> 00:13:56,046
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people were disappointed in Sega Ages, though.

235
00:13:56,066 --> 00:13:57,667
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a lot of people were stupid.

236
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,404
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't need RallyX.

237
00:14:00,564 --> 00:14:03,906
[SPEAKER_03]: RallyX is part of Ridge Racer for the PSP.

238
00:14:04,906 --> 00:14:08,729
[SPEAKER_00]: I could put in Tekken 5 and play Starblade until I'm giddy.

239
00:14:09,389 --> 00:14:10,169
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I'm already giddy.

240
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:15,953
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a huge retro fan, don't get me wrong, but this is thoroughly uninteresting to me.

241
00:14:16,153 --> 00:14:16,473
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

242
00:14:17,274 --> 00:14:23,037
[SPEAKER_05]: They could do all the interviews in the world they want to, but I feel like I did this already ten years ago when the PlayStation came out, and

243
00:14:24,025 --> 00:14:31,031
[SPEAKER_05]: These games are great, and they hold a space in the arcade game greats of all time, but I'm just not interested in playing them.

244
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,113
[SPEAKER_03]: I have another retro story.

245
00:14:33,193 --> 00:14:34,454
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sure.

246
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:45,543
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, this is, now, all of you might remember those wonderful, you know, the straight, you hook them up to the TV type of console systems, the flashbacks, what they call them.

247
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,203
[SPEAKER_03]: Asteroids Breakout, Centipede, Lunar Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, Pong

248
00:14:59,349 --> 00:15:02,651
[SPEAKER_03]: But amongst 30 others total.

249
00:15:02,951 --> 00:15:07,834
[SPEAKER_03]: Now the flashbacks are the actual console, not the joystick that you plug in.

250
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:08,715
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like the old Atari.

251
00:15:08,755 --> 00:15:09,495
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks like a console.

252
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,618
[SPEAKER_03]: This one, though, it's going to be great because it's going to be wood grain, just like the old ones.

253
00:15:13,638 --> 00:15:14,779
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

254
00:15:14,859 --> 00:15:23,965
[SPEAKER_05]: We were just talking about this because I remember we were talking about the Atari contest and that game Ninja Garden that got created in 24 hours is going to be in this, at least per that last story.

255
00:15:23,985 --> 00:15:24,205
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.

256
00:15:24,605 --> 00:15:28,089
[SPEAKER_05]: and we were talking about the wood, I believe Jamie said something about it needs to be in the wood grain.

257
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,692
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so cool if it is coming out in the wood grain.

258
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:31,733
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming out this summer.

259
00:15:32,013 --> 00:15:33,295
[SPEAKER_00]: That totally would make me happy.

260
00:15:33,315 --> 00:15:35,537
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe people from Atari were listening to this, huh?

261
00:15:35,758 --> 00:15:37,640
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, this summer, this summer for about $30.

262
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,601
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, $30 for Neoclassical Games?

263
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:44,765
[SPEAKER_00]: Addressing this at Classic Gaming Expo, because you know that's coming up in a couple months.

264
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:45,546
[SPEAKER_05]: Isn't that weird?

265
00:15:45,606 --> 00:15:52,973
[SPEAKER_05]: I just slammed Namco on the been there, done that attitude, and now here I am getting all giddy about the woodgrain Atari.

266
00:15:53,213 --> 00:15:56,257
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about, you know, how you execute it.

267
00:15:56,297 --> 00:15:57,157
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what it is.

268
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:57,858
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you're right.

269
00:15:57,938 --> 00:15:58,419
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you're right.

270
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:03,144
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they've released these Namco collections before, and now they're just releasing it on a new system.

271
00:16:03,784 --> 00:16:08,686
[SPEAKER_03]: And, for example, I have one of the Namco collections for the GBA already.

272
00:16:09,006 --> 00:16:11,327
[SPEAKER_03]: They already have these games out in the GBA.

273
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:14,249
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just re-releasing the same damn thing again.

274
00:16:14,409 --> 00:16:21,652
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, one thing, though, about those Namco collections on PS1, you do need to keep in mind that at least two of those are considered ultra-rare now.

275
00:16:22,292 --> 00:16:26,974
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot find the M, nor can you find the O. Actually, I take that back.

276
00:16:27,034 --> 00:16:28,535
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the A and the C. I take that back.

277
00:16:29,434 --> 00:16:31,515
[SPEAKER_00]: Which I actually, I think I have all of them now.

278
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:35,157
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they've released the restricted symbol in Japan.

279
00:16:37,278 --> 00:16:39,059
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, those are collector's items.

280
00:16:40,039 --> 00:16:43,121
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not going to be able to find those games on PS1.

281
00:16:43,261 --> 00:16:46,622
[SPEAKER_05]: But not a lot of those games are part of this compilation.

282
00:16:46,963 --> 00:16:50,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, even so, they're getting... I never saw Mappy released on one.

283
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:52,665
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought Mappy was in the first one.

284
00:16:53,406 --> 00:16:54,126
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I recall.

285
00:16:54,246 --> 00:16:54,566
[SPEAKER_00]: My bad.

286
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:55,967
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, it probably was.

287
00:16:56,227 --> 00:16:58,048
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, you know...

288
00:16:58,812 --> 00:16:59,152
[SPEAKER_00]: Namco Story

289
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,233
[SPEAKER_05]: Another series now going from very old Namco to very new Namco.

290
00:17:23,313 --> 00:17:24,414
[SPEAKER_05]: Katamari Damacy 2.

291
00:17:25,235 --> 00:17:26,155
[SPEAKER_05]: Details released.

292
00:17:26,215 --> 00:17:28,817
[SPEAKER_00]: Nina Daisuke's Katamari Damacy.

293
00:17:29,718 --> 00:17:31,620
[SPEAKER_05]: Translates to We Love Katamari.

294
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,382
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is... Actually, they changed the title for the US.

295
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:34,762
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I'm sorry.

296
00:17:34,782 --> 00:17:37,284
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Everybody Loves Katamari Damacy in Japan.

297
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:38,966
[SPEAKER_00]: And here it's We Love Katamari Damacy.

298
00:17:39,146 --> 00:17:39,867
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got served.

299
00:17:40,007 --> 00:17:40,287
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.

300
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:43,149
[SPEAKER_05]: It is going to be called We Love Katamari in North America.

301
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,852
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this game is coming out here for sure.

302
00:17:45,952 --> 00:17:48,734
[SPEAKER_05]: There was still a little bit of a question mark, but it is coming out here.

303
00:17:50,201 --> 00:17:55,904
[SPEAKER_05]: Some great screenshots circulating out there on the internet, and it will be out in 2005, they're saying.

304
00:17:56,344 --> 00:18:03,527
[SPEAKER_05]: New locations, new objects, Eiffel Tower's been spotted, cats, trees, junk, humans.

305
00:18:03,567 --> 00:18:04,647
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to mention the new play modes.

306
00:18:05,188 --> 00:18:11,650
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, and apparently the co-op mode now is in better levels than just like, it was like an arena in the first one.

307
00:18:11,970 --> 00:18:14,151
[SPEAKER_00]: That was more of a versus.

308
00:18:14,371 --> 00:18:18,273
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, for the first one to even have that kind of versus mode in it.

309
00:18:18,809 --> 00:18:22,812
[SPEAKER_05]: was cool, but now Katamari 2 is going to expand on that, and I think that's cool.

310
00:18:23,613 --> 00:18:26,755
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one where you actually, to solve the level, you have to work together.

311
00:18:27,256 --> 00:18:27,656
[SPEAKER_05]: Very cool.

312
00:18:28,056 --> 00:18:29,677
[SPEAKER_05]: And you get to play as some of the cousins, too.

313
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:30,038
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, you do.

314
00:18:30,058 --> 00:18:30,798
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is very great.

315
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:38,544
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the cousins, I mean, there was all these great concepts in Katamari Namashi 1, but they didn't get to develop much of them, I think.

316
00:18:38,644 --> 00:18:44,809
[SPEAKER_05]: So Katamari, I think it's going to be one of those games that, it's going to be one of the big franchise games of the next decade.

317
00:18:45,297 --> 00:18:52,179
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to see if it expands bigger than that immediate area, if we actually end up with a world expansion as the camera moves out.

318
00:18:52,619 --> 00:18:53,619
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see, we'll see.

319
00:18:54,679 --> 00:19:00,201
[SPEAKER_05]: Alright, we're getting a lot of E3 news because E3 is just around the corner, so lots and lots of E3 news.

320
00:19:00,541 --> 00:19:04,002
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a concert that's going to be happening before E3, the Final Fantasy concert.

321
00:19:04,062 --> 00:19:12,144
[SPEAKER_05]: It's More Friends, music from Final Fantasy, and announced, and I am very, very excited about this, not only are the Black Mages going to be playing...

322
00:19:12,711 --> 00:19:21,175
[SPEAKER_05]: But Amiko Shiratori and Riki are going to be there singing their theme songs from Final Fantasy IX and Final Fantasy X. Excellent.

323
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,636
[SPEAKER_05]: Are going to be there singing the songs live.

324
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:23,536
[SPEAKER_05]: And get this.

325
00:19:24,276 --> 00:19:29,619
[SPEAKER_05]: The opera from Final Fantasy VI is being performed with opera singers.

326
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,100
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's going to be great.

327
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,621
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm so excited about this one.

328
00:19:33,641 --> 00:19:34,061
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting chills.

329
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:34,561
[SPEAKER_05]: Get this.

330
00:19:35,141 --> 00:19:39,083
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickets still available because this is at the Universal Amphitheater.

331
00:19:39,123 --> 00:19:40,864
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess they changed the name to Gibson Amphitheater.

332
00:19:41,577 --> 00:19:42,658
[SPEAKER_05]: Formally the Universal Amphitheater.

333
00:19:42,698 --> 00:19:44,159
[SPEAKER_05]: Tickets are still available because it's so big.

334
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,660
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the day before, right?

335
00:19:45,821 --> 00:19:46,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's Monday.

336
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:47,182
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the Monday before.

337
00:19:47,242 --> 00:19:47,722
[SPEAKER_05]: May 16th.

338
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:48,863
[SPEAKER_05]: Very, very soon.

339
00:19:49,383 --> 00:19:49,784
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta work.

340
00:19:50,344 --> 00:19:50,985
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, bummer.

341
00:19:51,805 --> 00:19:53,086
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really hoping that they tape it.

342
00:19:53,366 --> 00:19:56,649
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this is going to be... They haven't even done this in Japan yet.

343
00:19:56,669 --> 00:19:57,610
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be huge.

344
00:19:58,350 --> 00:20:00,332
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope they tape it and do a DVD or something.

345
00:20:01,471 --> 00:20:02,452
[SPEAKER_05]: More E3 news.

346
00:20:02,832 --> 00:20:04,192
[SPEAKER_05]: Squeenix, we'll move on with them.

347
00:20:04,232 --> 00:20:06,614
[SPEAKER_05]: They announced what games are going to be showing at E3.

348
00:20:07,394 --> 00:20:12,516
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy VII, Dirge of Cerebrus is going to be one of their big titles that they're going to be showing.

349
00:20:13,137 --> 00:20:16,478
[SPEAKER_05]: Final Fantasy XII, yet again, because it didn't come out like it was supposed to.

350
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,740
[SPEAKER_05]: Dragon Quest VIII, Journey of the Cursed King.

351
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:23,052
[SPEAKER_05]: Full Metal Alchemist 2, Curse of the Crimson Elixir.

352
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,694
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully that one's going to be better than the first one.

353
00:20:25,734 --> 00:20:28,376
[SPEAKER_05]: Apparently curses are the big thing in the role playing games this year.

354
00:20:28,397 --> 00:20:28,757
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

355
00:20:29,277 --> 00:20:31,779
[SPEAKER_05]: Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm hoping for a playable.

356
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:33,000
[SPEAKER_05]: That'd be great.

357
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,261
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to see a playable Kingdom Hearts 2.

358
00:20:35,222 --> 00:20:39,105
[SPEAKER_05]: Romancing Saga, can't say I'm a fan of the Saga series.

359
00:20:39,185 --> 00:20:40,066
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sorry.

360
00:20:40,086 --> 00:20:41,387
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried, I tried to.

361
00:20:41,727 --> 00:20:45,190
[SPEAKER_05]: But Front Mission Online, they're going to expand the online series.

362
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,931
[SPEAKER_00]: Front Missions started with the Super Nintendo back when.

363
00:20:50,151 --> 00:20:53,732
[SPEAKER_05]: Interesting enough, Squeenix is saying that they are, and we call them Squeenix.

364
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:57,973
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it's Square Enix or Squeenix, but we call them Squeenix.

365
00:20:58,673 --> 00:21:02,074
[SPEAKER_05]: On the PC, they have Final Fantasy XI as a game they're going to be showing off.

366
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:05,075
[SPEAKER_05]: Very strange, considering this game is a couple years old now.

367
00:21:05,135 --> 00:21:09,936
[SPEAKER_05]: So are they going to be showing off the new patches, or could there be a new expansion in the works?

368
00:21:10,176 --> 00:21:10,576
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope so.

369
00:21:10,596 --> 00:21:12,377
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's probably the new patches.

370
00:21:13,061 --> 00:21:17,764
[SPEAKER_03]: And from what I've heard, I know last year they had like a ballista tournament type thing going on.

371
00:21:18,065 --> 00:21:25,790
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is going to be the same tournament as they were having in some Hawaii location where it's kind of like a boss battle type thing.

372
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:27,931
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what they're doing with this one.

373
00:21:28,331 --> 00:21:28,652
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll see.

374
00:21:29,332 --> 00:21:31,013
[SPEAKER_05]: Eidos announced their lineup as well.

375
00:21:31,554 --> 00:21:37,838
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going to be interesting is that they're going to be showing the games Hitman, Blood Money, 25 to Life, Commando Strike Force, and...

376
00:21:38,579 --> 00:22:07,030
[SPEAKER_05]: Laura Croft, Tomb Raider Legend I thought that they had officially said no more Tomb Raider games Nope, I saw pictures There are pictures online I think Tomb Raider is done There are pictures online and Laura Croft has bigger boobs as usual I don't doubt that it's really happening I mean Tomb Raider was such a huge franchise but I think it's kind of done I have no interest in Tomb Raider Can you guess where those pictures are at?

377
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:08,480
[SPEAKER_03]: M.T.V.

378
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:08,640
[SPEAKER_03]: M.T.V.

379
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:38,519
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

380
00:22:38,619 --> 00:22:39,499
[SPEAKER_00]: Cookie Cutter TV.

381
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,662
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that there's better sites, but who knows?

382
00:22:42,842 --> 00:22:45,184
[SPEAKER_05]: They might do something to impress me later on, so we'll see.

383
00:22:45,905 --> 00:22:46,165
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.

384
00:22:47,526 --> 00:22:48,006
[SPEAKER_05]: I have faith.

385
00:22:50,288 --> 00:22:51,429
[SPEAKER_05]: E3, also one last story.

386
00:22:51,509 --> 00:22:57,794
[SPEAKER_05]: Yahoo is going to be doing a mobile show, and they're going to be showing Yahoo Poker.

387
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:02,738
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to do this whole cross-platform PC mobile thing, so that should be interesting.

388
00:23:03,959 --> 00:23:06,502
[SPEAKER_05]: Yahoo Poker, because Texas Hold'em is the big thing right now.

389
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:08,137
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll see.

390
00:23:09,198 --> 00:23:10,659
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, Orange Lounge Radio.

391
00:23:10,739 --> 00:23:21,424
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not just here to talk about gaming, but we're also here to better your life because, you know, if we talked about games all the time, we would have no time to go out and illegally gamble.

392
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:24,445
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're here to better your life with some advice.

393
00:23:24,545 --> 00:23:27,247
[SPEAKER_05]: Who better than DarkSakura with her advice column?

394
00:23:27,267 --> 00:23:31,149
[SPEAKER_05]: And DarkSakura, what do you have to share with us tonight?

395
00:23:32,449 --> 00:23:35,491
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's bit of advice is how to wrestle free from an alligator.

396
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:43,280
[SPEAKER_00]: 1.

397
00:23:38,039 --> 00:23:43,280
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on land, try to get on the alligator's back and put downward pressure on its neck.

398
00:23:43,661 --> 00:23:45,501
[SPEAKER_00]: This will force the head and jaws down.

399
00:23:46,901 --> 00:23:45,501
2.

400
00:23:47,381 --> 00:23:48,642
[SPEAKER_00]: Close the alligator's eyes.

401
00:23:48,762 --> 00:23:50,422
[SPEAKER_00]: This will usually make it more sedate.

402
00:23:51,262 --> 00:23:50,422
3.

403
00:23:51,382 --> 00:23:53,183
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were attacked, go for the eyes and nose.

404
00:23:53,283 --> 00:23:58,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Use any weapon you have or your fist.

405
00:23:59,624 --> 00:24:03,025
[SPEAKER_00]: If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove, for example, a limb.

406
00:24:03,706 --> 00:24:05,086
[SPEAKER_00]: Tap or punch it on the snout.

407
00:24:05,207 --> 00:24:07,767
[SPEAKER_00]: Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly.

408
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:12,569
[SPEAKER_00]: They may drop whatever it is they have taken hold of and back off.

409
00:24:13,069 --> 00:24:17,211
[SPEAKER_00]: If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or rolling over.

410
00:24:17,571 --> 00:24:20,172
[SPEAKER_00]: These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage.

411
00:24:20,652 --> 00:24:24,413
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to keep the mouth clamped shut so the alligator does not begin shaking.

412
00:24:25,453 --> 00:24:30,235
[SPEAKER_00]: Seek medical attention immediately, even for a small cut or bruise, to treat infection.

413
00:24:30,655 --> 00:24:33,176
[SPEAKER_00]: Alligators have a huge number of pathogens in their mouth.

414
00:24:34,235 --> 00:24:35,535
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I always say?

415
00:24:35,855 --> 00:24:36,115
[SPEAKER_05]: What?

416
00:24:36,836 --> 00:24:39,956
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't go freaking swimming in the swamp in Florida.

417
00:24:41,497 --> 00:24:42,057
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for that.

418
00:24:43,437 --> 00:24:44,317
[SPEAKER_05]: Always lovely advice.

419
00:24:46,798 --> 00:24:53,559
[SPEAKER_05]: How many of you guys know, quick survey, how many of you guys actually played Neopets previously?

420
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,740
[SPEAKER_01]: Jamie's got her hand raised.

421
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,540
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a long ass time ago.

422
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,060
[SPEAKER_05]: Weren't you into Neopets for a little bit, Loki?

423
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,361
[SPEAKER_05]: Or at least your girlfriend was, wasn't she?

424
00:24:58,501 --> 00:24:59,701
[SPEAKER_05]: My fiance is.

425
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,970
[SPEAKER_05]: I played Neopets for a little while.

426
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,030
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to think way back.

427
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:10,252
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the closest thing I had that was close to Neopets would have been my Pocket Station.

428
00:25:10,872 --> 00:25:17,594
[SPEAKER_05]: You know that Neopets has been this slowly huge growing thing online, and now they sell this stuff at Claire's and all that stuff.

429
00:25:17,914 --> 00:25:23,196
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know, a long time ago, Sony said that they were going to make a Neopets game, but then it just disappeared.

430
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:23,977
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, guess what?

431
00:25:25,097 --> 00:25:28,778
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out now, or at least some new version of the Neopets game.

432
00:25:29,278 --> 00:25:29,719
[SPEAKER_05]: August of 2005...

433
00:25:31,218 --> 00:25:53,229
[SPEAKER_05]: Neopets, The Darkest Fairy The 3D action adventure will follow the characters as they journey through the realm of Neopia I wonder if my Neopets are dead So they're saying it's going to be a third person action adventure You know what's sad?

434
00:25:55,130 --> 00:26:00,193
[SPEAKER_03]: Almost practically every game coming out for the PS2 is action adventure

435
00:26:01,246 --> 00:26:02,467
[SPEAKER_03]: Make More Puzzle Games for the PS2 and Xbox

436
00:26:26,431 --> 00:26:28,552
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, here's an interesting story that ties into that.

437
00:26:28,732 --> 00:26:30,173
[SPEAKER_05]: And games that we used to play.

438
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,774
[SPEAKER_05]: At least I know I did used to play this.

439
00:26:32,315 --> 00:26:33,595
[SPEAKER_05]: But this game got bigger and bigger.

440
00:26:33,695 --> 00:26:37,878
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle Pirates is now going to be... This used to be something you could only really get on the internet.

441
00:26:38,318 --> 00:26:39,299
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be in stores.

442
00:26:39,359 --> 00:26:40,659
[SPEAKER_05]: It's coming out in stores this week.

443
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,000
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be on the shelves.

444
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,062
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of interesting that Puzzle Pirates kind of got bigger like that.

445
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,044
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's going to be selling for $20.

446
00:26:49,545 --> 00:26:50,725
[SPEAKER_05]: Monthly subscription fee $9.95.

447
00:26:52,573 --> 00:26:54,194
[SPEAKER_05]: Puzzle games you can see in Puzzle Pirates.

448
00:26:54,294 --> 00:27:02,297
[SPEAKER_05]: Sword fighting, drinking, sailing, bilge pumping, carpentry, gunnery, distilling, and randomly they have spades in there.

449
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:09,120
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's interesting about Puzzle Pirates is that it's like the Puzzle Fighter 2 inspired game, the Bejeweled inspired game.

450
00:27:10,081 --> 00:27:13,482
[SPEAKER_05]: But I kind of had fun with Puzzle Pirates when I played it.

451
00:27:14,022 --> 00:27:20,685
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought the interface needed work, but again, before I get the hate mail from the Puzzle Pirates community, it was like two years ago and they were still baiting it when I played it.

452
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:25,035
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm sure a lot's changed and it's probably polished now, so I probably should go back and check it out.

453
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,337
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm glad the game's been successful.

454
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:29,798
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it was a neat idea.

455
00:27:30,438 --> 00:27:32,259
[SPEAKER_05]: But people are going way too far with the pirate thing.

456
00:27:32,339 --> 00:27:34,780
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, they have conventions where they all go and they dress up as pirates.

457
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,240
[SPEAKER_00]: Arr!

458
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,141
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.

459
00:27:36,161 --> 00:27:38,262
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost scary like some of the furry stuff.

460
00:27:38,322 --> 00:27:40,043
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know, worship Johnny Depp and stuff.

461
00:27:40,063 --> 00:27:40,363
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

462
00:27:44,642 --> 00:27:46,823
[SPEAKER_05]: Movie Studios and their UMDs.

463
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:48,683
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, the UMDs are getting bigger and bigger.

464
00:27:48,803 --> 00:27:59,767
[SPEAKER_05]: Fox is very, very close to committing, and the rumor is saying that their lineup would initially include Dodgeball, iRobot, Super Troopers, Predator, and Napoleon Dynamite.

465
00:28:00,527 --> 00:28:01,388
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, that's cool.

466
00:28:01,668 --> 00:28:03,108
[SPEAKER_05]: Universal, thinking about it.

467
00:28:03,228 --> 00:28:06,410
[SPEAKER_05]: Paramount is investigating it right now.

468
00:28:06,510 --> 00:28:09,851
[SPEAKER_05]: So UMDs look like it could be taking off.

469
00:28:10,271 --> 00:28:10,551
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't know.

470
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,423
[SPEAKER_05]: Loki, I'd say you're the expert on this.

471
00:28:12,443 --> 00:28:13,104
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your industry.

472
00:28:13,144 --> 00:28:14,185
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?

473
00:28:14,205 --> 00:28:16,006
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, they're trying to go this route.

474
00:28:16,406 --> 00:28:18,368
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to push this stuff way too much.

475
00:28:18,548 --> 00:28:20,269
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not seen sales figures on UMD.

476
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:21,290
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it really doing that well?

477
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:23,251
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, to be honest.

478
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,514
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I haven't really had anyone requesting UMD movies.

479
00:28:26,674 --> 00:28:37,282
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just trying to push it on these people, but honestly... See, because as far as PSPs go, rental-wise, there's not that many stores renting games for that stuff right now.

480
00:28:37,742 --> 00:28:38,663
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're...

481
00:28:39,401 --> 00:28:39,961
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura.com

482
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:58,757
[SPEAKER_03]: that you have a DVD for.

483
00:28:58,797 --> 00:28:59,457
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it either.

484
00:28:59,577 --> 00:29:00,177
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.

485
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:03,438
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they're looking for the portable convenience, but you know what?

486
00:29:03,458 --> 00:29:04,658
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got portable convenience.

487
00:29:04,718 --> 00:29:06,439
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a laptop.

488
00:29:06,899 --> 00:29:11,940
[SPEAKER_03]: The only way I can think that this would be probably better is those people that buy portable DVD players.

489
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:17,241
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can buy PSP for your kids because they're all, Mommy, Mommy, I want it!

490
00:29:17,421 --> 00:29:19,802
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they have the movies, too, that they can watch.

491
00:29:20,242 --> 00:29:24,163
[SPEAKER_03]: But nowadays, too, you also have all these SUVs and stuff with TVs in their car.

492
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:30,120
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, what it comes down to is kids need to learn to sit still and shut up and sleep during car rides.

493
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:38,828
[SPEAKER_03]: I have not heard anything about sales figures on the... I don't know how well they're doing, but apparently, I think... I don't know if it's going to take off, though.

494
00:29:38,968 --> 00:29:42,592
[SPEAKER_03]: I really... I'm really worrying about this.

495
00:29:42,612 --> 00:29:43,913
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, because it's just like people...

496
00:29:44,366 --> 00:29:51,031
[SPEAKER_03]: We're telling me months back, yeah, DVHS is gonna be the revolution, it's gonna hit the video industry, boo!

497
00:29:51,611 --> 00:29:55,654
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said from day one, I'm like, this thing is gonna fail faster than Laserdisc.

498
00:29:56,314 --> 00:29:59,577
[SPEAKER_03]: And watch, and guess what?

499
00:30:00,537 --> 00:30:01,858
[SPEAKER_03]: DVHS, what's that?

500
00:30:02,018 --> 00:30:04,140
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's right, it's not being made anymore.

501
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,671
[SPEAKER_05]: I would really like to hear from our listeners.

502
00:30:06,751 --> 00:30:10,814
[SPEAKER_05]: If you are somebody who is supporting the UMD and you're buying movies on UMD, we want to know why.

503
00:30:11,134 --> 00:30:13,336
[SPEAKER_05]: Send us an email, 2go at orangelawnradio.com.

504
00:30:13,596 --> 00:30:16,098
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm not, you know, we're not trying to say, like, oh, you're a bad person for doing it.

505
00:30:16,118 --> 00:30:17,579
[SPEAKER_05]: We just want to know, you know, what's the draw?

506
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,339
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the appeal to you?

507
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:18,980
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we don't see it.

508
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:23,162
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I got Spider-Man 2 with my PSP because I got the neat little bundle thing.

509
00:30:24,383 --> 00:30:27,225
[SPEAKER_03]: I would never see myself actually buying this or paying for this.

510
00:30:28,226 --> 00:30:30,787
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really, I don't know.

511
00:30:30,827 --> 00:30:33,009
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just not anything I would spend money on.

512
00:30:34,470 --> 00:30:34,630
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.

513
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:38,003
[SPEAKER_04]: DarkSakura, did you have anything you wanted to add?

514
00:30:38,563 --> 00:30:41,646
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm actually looking for the sales figures.

515
00:30:41,706 --> 00:30:46,410
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that there would be a financial report out already, but I haven't found one yet.

516
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,131
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm sure we'll see something on the next show.

517
00:30:48,151 --> 00:30:49,793
[SPEAKER_03]: Studios, here's what you need to be doing.

518
00:30:49,993 --> 00:30:52,115
[SPEAKER_03]: And trust me, this is the greatest idea right here.

519
00:30:52,675 --> 00:31:01,463
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everybody, at least this is what I've been using my large memory stick for, TV episodes.

520
00:31:02,589 --> 00:31:03,009
[SPEAKER_03]: and so on.

521
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,112
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 minutes, I watch my robot chickens, and I watch my family guy.

522
00:31:32,612 --> 00:31:33,132
[SPEAKER_03]: And there you go.

523
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,214
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just enough time to sit down and watch this really quick.

524
00:31:36,314 --> 00:31:37,294
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright, I see where you're going with that.

525
00:31:37,414 --> 00:31:38,215
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, okay.

526
00:31:38,675 --> 00:31:39,255
[SPEAKER_04]: Interesting idea.

527
00:31:39,775 --> 00:31:40,976
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I think they need to be doing.

528
00:31:41,016 --> 00:31:44,558
[SPEAKER_03]: TV shows instead of movies in UMD format.

529
00:31:44,598 --> 00:31:45,858
[SPEAKER_05]: Because the internet's doing it already.

530
00:31:46,118 --> 00:31:47,559
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you just said, you've already done it.

531
00:31:48,089 --> 00:31:50,010
[SPEAKER_05]: The Silent Hill Movie has begun filming.

532
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:19,934
[SPEAKER_05]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

533
00:32:38,317 --> 00:32:44,383
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the scenes from the actual game are showing up in the movie, so they're definitely having that tie.

534
00:32:44,423 --> 00:32:50,468
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's actually already looking better to be better associated with the universe than, say, the Resident Evil movies were.

535
00:32:50,888 --> 00:32:52,290
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's looking very good so far.

536
00:32:52,330 --> 00:32:54,271
[SPEAKER_00]: They've definitely got the feel down.

537
00:32:55,372 --> 00:33:04,561
[SPEAKER_00]: So far on the cast they have, I guess it's pronounced Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland as Rose, who is the main character.

538
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:07,201
[SPEAKER_00]: As her daughter, they have Jodell Ferlin.

539
00:33:07,241 --> 00:33:11,422
[SPEAKER_00]: And as her husband, they have Sean Bean, who was Boromir in Fellowship of the Rings.

540
00:33:11,682 --> 00:33:13,362
[SPEAKER_05]: And Yui Bull is not directing this, right?

541
00:33:13,702 --> 00:33:13,962
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

542
00:33:14,242 --> 00:33:14,562
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no.

543
00:33:14,582 --> 00:33:14,922
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, phew.

544
00:33:15,262 --> 00:33:15,523
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

545
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:18,363
[SPEAKER_00]: I had who it was a moment ago.

546
00:33:18,463 --> 00:33:20,364
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to say it was the guy that did Brotherhood of the Wolf.

547
00:33:20,444 --> 00:33:21,264
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're correct.

548
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:22,584
[SPEAKER_05]: Kristoff something.

549
00:33:23,404 --> 00:33:23,664
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.

550
00:33:24,605 --> 00:33:29,106
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I really have high hopes for this.

551
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:32,687
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hope, I kind of hope that Akira Yamaoka gets to do the music.

552
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:33,927
[SPEAKER_00]: To really keep it up, yeah.

553
00:33:36,122 --> 00:33:39,624
[SPEAKER_05]: Christoph Gans is the director.

554
00:33:42,486 --> 00:33:44,067
[SPEAKER_00]: Production company Davis Films.

555
00:33:46,629 --> 00:33:48,030
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Avery is the scripting.

556
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:52,893
[SPEAKER_00]: Makeup by Paul Jones, who did Resident Evil Apocalypse.

557
00:33:53,654 --> 00:33:54,855
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's doing the gore effects.

558
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:59,718
[SPEAKER_00]: And the guy who did Underworld is doing the creatures.

559
00:34:00,526 --> 00:34:05,470
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I guess, although I don't know how much I'd want this movie to have in common with Underworld.

560
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:08,713
[SPEAKER_00]: The budget at present is $45 to $50 million.

561
00:34:08,733 --> 00:34:10,414
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a lot of faith in this movie.

562
00:34:10,434 --> 00:34:12,877
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about $25,000 a day for production.

563
00:34:14,778 --> 00:34:15,879
[SPEAKER_05]: I have high hopes for this movie.

564
00:34:15,899 --> 00:34:17,761
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope they get it right.

565
00:34:18,581 --> 00:34:21,184
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, we need a good video game movie.

566
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:22,164
[SPEAKER_05]: We really do.

567
00:34:22,365 --> 00:34:24,106
[SPEAKER_05]: Please don't screw this up, you guys.

568
00:34:24,566 --> 00:34:25,127
[SPEAKER_05]: Pretty please.

569
00:34:25,592 --> 00:34:26,513
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for watching!

570
00:34:39,827 --> 00:34:40,567
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's wrap it up.

571
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:43,149
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go around and give everybody's final words for tonight.

572
00:34:43,209 --> 00:34:44,329
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, one last thing I did want to add.

573
00:34:44,710 --> 00:34:48,692
[SPEAKER_05]: If you notice our sound is a little bit different tonight, that's because we're actually in a new studio.

574
00:34:49,092 --> 00:34:51,153
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had to kind of redo everything.

575
00:34:51,473 --> 00:34:52,834
[SPEAKER_05]: We went through a move here locally.

576
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:54,995
[SPEAKER_05]: So we redid all our chords.

577
00:34:55,015 --> 00:34:56,356
[SPEAKER_05]: So our sound is a little different.

578
00:34:57,036 --> 00:34:58,037
[SPEAKER_05]: Tell us what you guys think.

579
00:34:58,197 --> 00:34:59,898
[SPEAKER_05]: If you think we should tweak it or whatever.

580
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,119
[SPEAKER_05]: 2go at OrangeLaunchRadio.com.

581
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:02,799
[SPEAKER_05]: T-O-G-O.

582
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:06,301
[SPEAKER_00]: So you thought that you got rid of something from the old studio.

583
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:07,502
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you found it, didn't you?

584
00:35:09,063 --> 00:35:10,263
[SPEAKER_05]: A little stuffed ferret.

585
00:35:10,863 --> 00:35:11,303
[SPEAKER_05]: Hooray.

586
00:35:11,463 --> 00:35:13,184
[SPEAKER_00]: They found a way back.

587
00:35:13,944 --> 00:35:16,164
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought I buried that in the deepest, darkest box.

588
00:35:16,244 --> 00:35:16,804
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, anyway.

589
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:18,665
[SPEAKER_03]: Final thoughts, Loki.

590
00:35:19,405 --> 00:35:24,226
[SPEAKER_03]: I forgot to mention this on the three-hour show that we do, but here's something I'd like to mention.

591
00:35:24,246 --> 00:35:25,186
[SPEAKER_03]: Fine.

592
00:35:25,386 --> 00:35:30,847
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to see the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the movie that came out recently, and there's people wearing towels.

593
00:35:31,327 --> 00:35:37,648
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, granted, I know that this is part of the book, and people, you know, they're fans of the book, and they want to dress up for stuff.

594
00:35:38,342 --> 00:35:40,143
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a big problem with this.

595
00:35:40,543 --> 00:35:41,643
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a movie.

596
00:35:41,743 --> 00:35:43,024
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a convention.

597
00:35:43,104 --> 00:35:44,564
[SPEAKER_03]: It does not require cosplay.

598
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:47,105
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate the people that dress up like Star Wars characters.

599
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:47,626
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, wait a minute.

600
00:35:47,666 --> 00:35:52,107
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who did Rocky Horror Picture Show a couple times... Okay, there's a little difference.

601
00:35:52,307 --> 00:35:56,429
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a difference between participating in the movie and going to watch a movie in costume.

602
00:35:56,509 --> 00:35:57,509
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that's a little different.

603
00:35:58,370 --> 00:36:00,390
[SPEAKER_05]: Star Wars is not a participation movie.

604
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:01,791
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not a participation movie.

605
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:06,953
[SPEAKER_03]: And all these people dress up and they're in character and stuff like that.

606
00:36:07,349 --> 00:36:12,671
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have problems with that, the Matrix people and the Lord of the Rings people because you all do this.

607
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:15,492
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the Star Wars people with their lightsabers.

608
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:16,312
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.

609
00:36:16,452 --> 00:36:18,372
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate these people and they're so annoying.

610
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:22,914
[SPEAKER_03]: They are goddamn annoying and they just, ugh.

611
00:36:22,954 --> 00:36:23,514
[SPEAKER_05]: They bug me.

612
00:36:23,614 --> 00:36:30,536
[SPEAKER_05]: The hardcore people ruined the Phantom Menace for me because they cheered at every reference and I was missing dialogue because they just would not be quiet.

613
00:36:30,696 --> 00:36:32,237
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have to say something in their favor.

614
00:36:32,397 --> 00:36:32,657
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.

615
00:36:33,297 --> 00:36:35,918
[SPEAKER_00]: When we were in line for the Phantom Menace, it's actually better than the movie.

616
00:36:36,596 --> 00:36:39,638
[SPEAKER_00]: This was at the theater in Roseville with the trees everywhere.

617
00:36:40,059 --> 00:36:46,123
[SPEAKER_00]: And people pulled out of line, brought out their lightsabers, and had an impromptu duel under the trees with the lights behind them.

618
00:36:46,163 --> 00:36:48,685
[SPEAKER_00]: So all you saw was their silhouettes and the glowing lightsaber.

619
00:36:49,285 --> 00:36:50,346
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was better than the movie.

620
00:36:51,267 --> 00:36:53,549
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to admit, though, that's pretty geeky.

621
00:36:53,569 --> 00:36:55,230
[SPEAKER_00]: That was geeky, but it was awesome.

622
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:57,151
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you think either one of them got laid that night?

623
00:36:57,972 --> 00:36:58,432
[SPEAKER_00]: Who cares?

624
00:36:58,472 --> 00:36:59,273
[SPEAKER_00]: They were cool for five minutes.

625
00:36:59,293 --> 00:37:00,133
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I love?

626
00:37:00,574 --> 00:37:01,935
[SPEAKER_03]: I love the people that wait in line.

627
00:37:02,858 --> 00:37:05,639
[SPEAKER_03]: DarkSakura, your final thought My final thought is I have a headache

628
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:57,008
