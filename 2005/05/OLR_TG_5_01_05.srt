Hello, everybody, again for another week.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
We are here with the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition,

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:29,000
our podcast dedicated to what's going on in the gamer world.

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,100
this is information the gamers really want to know about and you know this

9
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:39,020
week we're famous famous famous do you know me I am so famous my name is Rob

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,720
Roberts you might know me as sky the famous voices you hear behind me is the

11
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,620
lovely dark Sakura no it's Jamie Summers because I'm an internet celebrity and

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:51,800
the one and only Loki just call me the foot yes our egos are a little big this

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,940
week because we were in the local paper they did a nice lovely article on

14
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,980
Podcasting and we were one of the three podcasts from the area featured in it. We were very happy

15
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,520
Except for Loki because all they showed was a picture of his foot

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:07,600
Because we were playing DDR for those of you guys haven't seen the article

17
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,360
It's it's it's it has a picture of Loki playing DDR while we're taping

18
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,400
It's actually the articles a little bit of a stretch because it says it's about the podcast

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,180
But they actually took pictures while we were taping our three-hour program

20
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,360
So, um, Loki was playing DDR and we were commenting on it and you can see, uh, DarkSakura sitting

21
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,180
on our laptop looking on and I'm just saying something, I don't know, and then you see

22
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,180
Loki's foot.

23
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,180
This is kind of funny.

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:32,180
The precious.

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:33,180
Not the foot.

26
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,180
The foot's not the precious.

27
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:35,180
No, the laptop's the precious.

28
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:36,180
It's the laptop.

29
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,180
But, uh, yeah.

30
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,180
At least, you know, they picked the most toned part of my body to take a picture of my foot.

31
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:44,160
Although your feet were kind of curving funny, that was very interesting.

32
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,820
I don't know what happened there, I was just, I don't know.

33
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:51,960
So big thanks to SACB for filling our media horror ego.

34
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,220
We do love that.

35
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:57,880
And if anybody else wants to help us inflate our media horror ego, send us a message.

36
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:58,880
ToGo.

37
00:01:58,880 --> 00:01:59,880
T-O-G-O.

38
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,600
They sold six more papers the other day.

39
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,140
Also did you guys know that last week we were OneUp.com's audio blog of the day at some

40
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:10,140
point last week?

41
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,060
We're even more of an internet celebrity now.

42
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:13,060
That was just awesome.

43
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:14,940
So thank you guys over at OneUp.com.

44
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,300
I think OneUp.com is a neat idea.

45
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:20,920
I love their community stuff, and I'm not just saying that because they, you know, made

46
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,920
this audio blog of the day.

47
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,520
I've actually been a member of the community for longer, so.

48
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,520
But it's neat.

49
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,720
I was very happy about that.

50
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,960
It's nice to be respected by your peers.

51
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,960
Well, you know, with all these blogs and everything, I'm thinking about starting up a new one on

52
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,960
MySpace.

53
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,960
Oh, okay.

54
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:34,480
Starting up the Orange Lounge on MySpace.

55
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,840
You know, actually, I just found out today at orangeloungeradio.com, we have the capability

56
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,080
to do blogs there.

57
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,360
We just don't.

58
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,880
So I don't know, we may have to do something.

59
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,880
We'll see, though.

60
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,880
We'll see.

61
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,520
Anyway, enough about us inflating our egos.

62
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,520

67
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,160
got a half hour so let's talk about the games Dark Sakura I know it's been a

68
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,160
crazy week for you and you got a lot of stuff going on but have you managed to

69
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,700
get any gaming done during your week this week no not really just

70
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,200
unfortunately had a lot of stuff going on the person I've had lots of real-life

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:32,080
drama going on so I've been focusing on that no I did play a little luminous but

72
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,700
I watched Dan beat Metal Gear acid okay how was that he said that game was

73
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,260
trippy and hard what do you think of Metal Gear acid compared to with the

74
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:48,260
I'm not into card games, and I'm not into strategy games. It's more like a real-time strategy, and I don't like those type of things.

75
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,260
So, you know, you're, please welcome to it. If you like Fire Emblem, and, like, Metal Gear, you'll like this game.

76
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,260
Fair enough.

77
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,260
That's really it.

78
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,260
Loki, how about you?

79
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:05,260
First, I'd like to say, Metal Gear Acid reminds me of Phantasy Star, was it a 4? Phantasy Star Online 4?

80
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:07,260
Uh, it was a volume 3.

81
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,260
Volume 3.

82
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:13,240
Yes, the card game. We all remember how that worked. Well, it worked about just the same

83
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:13,920
for Mellow Your Eyes.

84
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,460
Funny enough with Phantasy Star IV, now they're going back to what worked in 1 and 2. Funny

85
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:17,940
enough.

86
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:24,540
Yeah, yeah. The card game thing? Ah, you know what? Buy cards. If you're going to play a

87
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,480
card game, play a card game. Don't play a game that's a video game that's a card game.

88
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:36,480
That's just redundant. That's too much. Anyways, my week, I played one game and that one game

89
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:43,480
would be Ridge Racer for the PSP. And I went through about, oh man, like 13 of the World

90
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:52,880
Tour things. I'm now on pro 20 I think. And I just unlocked the Rally-X car by beating

91
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
the minigame. We got 50,000 points on that. So I got the Rally-X car which is so awesome

92
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,200
because the Rally-X car is all pixelated just like, you know, the actual game. And when

93
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,160
you use the nitro boost, it does these little pixelated clouds behind you.

94
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Oh, just like it did in rally X if you played the old school game.

95
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:11,920
Yeah, like the smokescreen.

96
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:19,040
And that was, I think, it's just little details like that Namco throws in, it's awesome.

97
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:23,480
The race before that had the race, what they called, I guess the devil car or something

98
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:24,760
like that.

99
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,760
And that sucked.

100
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:26,760
It was a one-on-one race.

101
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,920
But see, what's really awesome is once you get past pro 18, it's all like kind of challenge

102
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:35,960
mode type stuff where you have like one-on-one races with stuff to unlock special cars and

103
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:40,520
whatnot and those are really cool i've been playing this game like all week i mean it's

104
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:46,120
held my attention that long it's just really really good game cool anything else then um

105
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,720
you know that's all i played this week i haven't played anything else um i have kind of a different

106
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,080
story than you do for my gaming week uh you were on psp i was on ds i picked up a new game called

107
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,640
Polarium for the DS. It's a puzzle game. I'm looking at that one too. Were you looking at that?

108
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:07,040
That and Mercury for PSV. I picked up Polarium because I'm a big puzzle game fan. I like those

109
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,240
kinds. I love Luminous and you know this goes back to Tetris, Yoshi's Cookie and

110
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,640
Tetris Attack and those types of games too. So I picked up Polarium which is

111
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,660
basically the concept of Polarium is that you have all these squares so at

112
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,280
first glance you might think it's kind of like Luminous but has nothing to do

113
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,080
with it really their games aren't the same at all but you use the stylus you

114
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:31,400
draw lines and that's how you you're changing you're swapping tiles and I

115
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,480
know that sounds really simple but because you can only draw the lines so

116
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,760
fast you actually have to think ahead about how you're gonna draw the lines so

117
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:41,880
it sounds like a pretty killer concept huh I polarium held my attention for

118
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:45,720
about an hour and then I was done with it I was very disappointed with polarium

119
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,560
that's just me personally I thought the graphics were boring as heck I thought

120
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:56,060
the sound it sounded like garbage I thought the puzzles were kind of

121
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,180
interesting but I just didn't like the concept I mean I take that back I like

122
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:05,220
the idea of the game it kind of makes you go could this be a fun puzzle game

123
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,100
but the execution didn't like it I can't recommend this game I don't like it at

124
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,060
all especially when you put it next to a game such as luminous you know and I

125
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,380
think this might be in some ways DS's answer to luminous but if you think of

126
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,280
it that way you're really gonna be disappointed this is nothing I think

127
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:25,080
mercury is also gonna blow it out of the water to luminous the bar has been set

128
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:29,320
so high with luminous I think I did I'm thinking that mercury is gonna be pretty

129
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:33,320
big though I'm curious about mercury I'm also curious about I'm not giving up on

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,000
DS just yet because I'm very very curious about medios I've heard a lot of

131
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,300
good things about that I just want smart bomb that's what I've been waiting for

132
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,800
polarium was just polarium is the type of game I would have expected like you

133
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,800
You know how they have like third-party publishers?

134
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,240
Like I always expected Plarium to come out like from a fourth-party publisher on the

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,240
Super Nintendo.

136
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,560
That's what I did the graphics for.

137
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,800
Honestly, some of these games for the DS are starting to be like rushed.

138
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,440
Plarium felt like a tech demo.

139
00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,440
It did.

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,440
It seriously, it's like rushed.

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,440
It's like Zookeeper.

142
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Come on now.

143
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,040
It's a flash game that they threw on the DS.

144
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,320
That is like a dumb excuse.

145
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,840
Hey, they actually put Snood on the Game Boy Advance.

146
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:14,560
DS is going to lose this battle unless things start changing fast.

147
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,120
These games are not impressive, they're not.

148
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,560
I know at E3 they're going to announce that stupid internet connectivity or whatever like

149
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,560
that.

150
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
We think, but...

151
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,000
It's pretty solid that's what's going to happen.

152
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,800
I don't think it's going to matter at this point because pretty soon, what is it, the

153
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,120
PSP's already got internet connectivity and they're going to have a web browser probably

154
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,600
for that coming out this year.

155
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:44,680
If the revolution blows everything else out of the water, does the DS have a chance?

156
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
I don't know.

157
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:50,200
They're going to probably do a redesign of it just like they did with Advance and it's

158
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,200
going to be another game system to buy.

159
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,460
All they need to do is start putting out some more of their franchise games that are good.

160
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:57,400
Like the Metroid demo was pretty nice.

161
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
They should put out the Metroid game.

162
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,240
I know they're probably trying to finish it, but...

163
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,240
Okay, okay.

164
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,240
Here's what I don't understand.

165
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:09,160
ported Mario 64, good for you, um, why didn't you make a new Mario game? I mean, that's

166
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:13,800
why I'm wondering, why didn't you make a new game? I mean, that's what they did. Well,

167
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,960
I mean, they altered Mario 64, so it's almost like a whole different game when you play

168
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:20,280
Yoshi and stuff. Look at the game, Wade Manso, that's all it was for the most part, is ported

169
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:25,640
games. I've already got Pac-Pix out in Japan, and that's not fair. Pac-Pix is coming out

170
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,400
here very, very soon though, which is exciting. Alright, let's, no, let's go, I'm sorry. Actually,

171
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:35,640
still want the pac-man marble madness type game that needs to hurry up and a

172
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,160
once more for our listener oh that's right we talked about this on show a

173
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,440
couple weeks ago the pack and roll one yeah we definitely need that soon the

174
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,680
lack of marble madness in the world soon I want to stop tonight's gaming news

175
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,240
actually talking about the revolution because there's a big rumor going around

176
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,240
about revolution right now this is actually slash dotted earlier this week

177
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:57,440
from games slash dot org and they say that actually IGN I guess they're in

178
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,800
turn reporting this. They saying that this person Brooke Burgess of Broken

179
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,600
Saints has said something about the Nintendo Revolution console and this is

180
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:15,240
that 3D projection is the big revolution. It's 3D projecting and yes

181
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,680
it's just like it sounds. It's gonna project images in 3D. Virtual Boy part 2?

182
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:23,860
I know that was the first thing I thought of too is like didn't the Virtual

183
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:28,180
boy fail miserably? You mean the great red headache machine?

184
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:31,820
Pretty much! Let's have a migraine! You can pay 30 bucks for it!

185
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:36,200
The Virtual Boy was kind of a cool idea though. I mean, it really was. But that's the first

186
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,420
thing my brain goes to when I hear about this revolution.

187
00:10:38,420 --> 00:10:43,260
It was a good idea too early in its time. It had fun commercials.

188
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:48,380
The Virtual Boy, it was a great idea. Monochrome red, that was a bad point. And the fact that

189
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:52,220
it wasn't really that much of a portable machine, you had to kind of like sit it down on a table

190
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:55,920
to be able to use it. So that was the problem.

191
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:02,920
Now before you laugh this story off, consider that, and this is what the article goes on

192
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:07,080
to say, consider that there have been recent patents filed by Nintendo that kind of support

193
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:11,640
that this is possibly the direction. Obviously nothing is confirmed until Nintendo says something

194
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,160
themselves, but speculatively...

195
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:18,120
I am going to say that this is probably the case, and here's why I think that. They have

196
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:22,040
been very quiet about the revolution. They haven't said anything, and this is what's

197
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:26,160
gonna happen. You're gonna have all this, like, you know, everyone's like, oh, PS3,

198
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:33,160
you know, Xbox 360. Then it's all BAM! Revolution. Because the Xbox 360 and the PS3, as far as

199
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:41,840
you know, improving the graphics and stuff, they haven't really done anything new. But

200
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:45,840
it's also, Nintendo's been known for gimmicky type of things.

201
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:50,400
It'll be interesting, I'm looking forward to seeing if this is true or not and how this

202
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,140
is all gonna play out.

203
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,460
It's hard to say until I see it in action, you know what I mean?

204
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:01,100
The concept sounds interesting, although I really hope they've learned the mistakes from

205
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:04,120
Virtual Boy and that this won't cause seizures and headaches, but...

206
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:08,200
I'm wondering if this new 3D stuff, if we'll see a Power Girl 2?

207
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,040
We'll see.

208
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:17,300
know that Nintendo licensed the Palm OS. Yeah, actually there's a note they're

209
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:21,260
supposed to be making a cartridge to where you can run the Palm OS software

210
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:25,340
on your DS. It's gonna be very interesting to see how the DS and the Revolution

211
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:28,340
work together if the 3D projection thing is cool. Will I be able to poke things with

212
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:32,980
my stylus? No, basically what the 3D projection is it's gonna be

213
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:36,800
stereoscopic 3D basically just like if you go into an IMAX movie and you have

214
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,640
your glasses that's what you're gonna get with this it's gonna be 3d with

215
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:45,160
glasses I think so you're talking about 3d glasses not actual like hologram

216
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,780
projection I think we're a little I think we're a little early for but that

217
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:53,920
would be revolutionary would it not yeah I would but then though I guess would

218
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,960
that mean that would not need a TV for that or something I don't know I don't

219
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:00,800
know we'll see whatever I mean hey and whatever they want to do I mean if

220
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,240
they've got you know holograms hey um since Namco got brought up a little

221
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,600
earlier in the show several times. I have a couple Namco stories tonight and I

222
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,280
know this always makes Dark Soccer happy because she's a big Namco fan. What is

223
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,880
happening is that Namco is going to be releasing a brand new compilation, yes

224
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:23,680
another one, for their 50th anniversary. They are collecting 14 arcade titles and

225
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:29,320
putting it out on PS2, GameCube, Xbox, PC, and GBA. It's coming out in August and

226
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:34,760
it's called the 50th Anniversary Arcade Collection. Pac-Man, Ms. Pac-Man, Galaga,

227
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:40,620
Galaxian, Dig Dug, Pole Positions 1 and 2, Rally-X, Rolling Thunder, and more, including

228
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:42,960
Xevious, Mappy, etc, etc.

229
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:43,960
Mappy!

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,800
Been there, done that, with all this?

231
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,800
Mappy!

232
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,640
Why can't I just go out and get the PlayStation 1 discs?

233
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:49,640
I mean, what-

234
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:50,640
Well, they need to-

235
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,640
Big deal.

236
00:13:51,640 --> 00:13:52,640
They need to do what SEGA did.

237
00:13:52,640 --> 00:13:53,640
And-

238
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
Like, with the SEGA ages.

239
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,440
A lot of people were disappointed in SEGA ages, though.

240
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,320
A lot of people were stupid.

241
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:04,680
I don't need Rally-X. Rally-X is part of, um, Ridge Racer for the PSV.

242
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:10,500
I could put in Tekken 5 and play Starblade until I'm giddy, which I'm already giddy.

243
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:16,060
I'm a huge retro fan, don't get me wrong, but this is thoroughly uninteresting to me.

244
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:20,140
I don't know, they could do all the interviews in the world they want to, but I feel like

245
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:24,820
I did this already ten years ago when the PlayStation came out, and these games are

246
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:30,260
great and they hold a space in the arcade game greats of all time, but I'm just not

247
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
interested in playing them again.

248
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:38,220
another another retro story okay sure actually this is now all you might

249
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:42,540
remember those wonderful you know the straight you hook them up to the TV type

250
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,620
of console systems the flashbacks what they call them oh sure sure yeah okay

251
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:51,060
well they're coming out with the flashback 2.0 mm-hmm and so I'm gonna

252
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,540
basically have more 2600 games including asteroids breakout centipede lunar

253
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:02,980
Lander, Millipede, Missile Command, and Pong, but amongst three others total.

254
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:07,780
Now the flashbacks are the actual console, not the like joystick that you plug in.

255
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,780
It looks like the old Atari.

256
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,860
It looks like a console.

257
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:13,120
This one though, it's going to be great because it's going to be wood grain, just like the

258
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,120
old ones.

259
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,120
Alright!

260
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,660
We were just talking about this because I remember we were talking about the Atari contest

261
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:23,300
and that game Ninja Garden that got created in 24 hours is going to be in this, at least

262
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,660
per the last story.

263
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:28,020
We were talking about the wood you believe Jamie said something about it needs to be in the wood grain

264
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,020
That is so cool. If it is coming out in the wood grain coming up

265
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:36,540
Hey, man, that totally would make me happy maybe people from Atari were listening to this, huh? Yeah summer

266
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,140
Yeah summer for about 30 bucks. Hey 30 bucks for

267
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:45,420
Addressing it is a classic gaming expo because you do know that's coming up in a couple months. Isn't that weird?

268
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:52,140
I just slammed Namco on the been there done that attitude and now here I am getting all giddy about the wood grain

269
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,140
It's all about, you know, how you execute it. That's really what it is.

270
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,140
I guess you're right. I guess you're right.

271
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,140
Because they've released these Namco collections before and now they're just releasing it on a new system.

272
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:08,140
And for example, I have one of the Namco collections for the GBA already.

273
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:14,140
They already have these games out in the GBA. It's just re-releasing the same damn thing again.

274
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:21,140
Well, also one thing though about those Namco collections on PS1, you do need to keep in mind that at least two of those are considered ultra rare now.

275
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:26,820
air now you cannot find the M nor can you find the O actually I think that

276
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:31,000
back it was the A and the C I take that back which I actually I think I have all

277
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:37,380
of them now and then they've released the restricted symbol in Japan so

278
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:42,060
actually those are collectors items people are not going to be able to find

279
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:45,980
those games on ps1 but not a lot of those games are a part of this

280
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:50,060
compilation so you know even so they're getting you know I've never saw Mappy

281
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:53,740
released on one I thought maybe it was in the first one oh I guess not that I

282
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:59,380
recall my bad um actually it probably was but even so you know these are full

283
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:04,580
arcade versions it's a lot of them in one package you know I'm gonna have it

284
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:08,780
you know playing Xevious at home and then go ahead and play a mappy and then

285
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:12,620
pack land if I want to of course I could play pack land on my turbo graphics but

286
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:19,980
still it's pretty cool fair enough um another Namco story another

287
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:24,980
series now going from very old to Namco to very new Namco Katamari Dimashii to

288
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,860
details released Nina Daisuke Katamari Dimashii translates to we love

289
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,980
Katamari and it is actually they changed the title for the oh I'm sorry they did

290
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:38,580
it's everybody loves Katamari Dimashii in Japan here it's we love Katamari

291
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,580
Dimashii I just got served all right it is gonna be called we love Katamari in

292
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:46,480
North America and so this game is coming out here for sure there was still a

293
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:50,640
little bit of a question mark but it is coming out here for sure some great

294
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,280
screenshots circulating out there on the internet and it will be out in 2005

295
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:02,160
they're saying new locations new objects Eiffel Tower has been spotted cats trees

296
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:09,960
junk yes and apparently the co-op mode now is in better levels than just like

297
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,880
it was like an arena in the first one that was more of a versus yeah but the

298
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,380
first one to even have that kind of versus mode in it was cool but now

299
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:24,060
Katamari 2 is gonna expand on that and I think that's cool and this one we

300
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:28,500
actually to solve the level you have to work together very cool and you get to

301
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:32,700
play as some of the cousins too which is great so because the cousins I mean

302
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:36,140
there was all these great concepts in Katamari to mashi one but they didn't

303
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:40,400
get to develop much of them, I think. So Katamari, I think, is going to be one of those games

304
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:45,060
that it's going to be one of the big franchise games of the next decade.

305
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:49,700
I'd love to see how, if it expands bigger than that immediate area, if we actually end

306
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,700
up with a world expansion as the camera moves out.

307
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:58,220
We'll see, we'll see. Alright, we're getting a lot of E3 news, because E3 is just around

308
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,420
the corner, so lots and lots of E3 news. There's a concert that's going to be happening before

309
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:06,460
E3 the Final Fantasy concert is more friends music from Final Fantasy and

310
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:11,060
announced and I am very very excited about this not only are the black mage

311
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:16,580

321

324
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,280
titles that they're gonna be showing Final Fantasy 12 yet again because it

325
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,360
didn't come out like it was supposed to Dragon Quest 8 journey of the cursed

326
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:24,360
King, Full Metal Alchemist 2, Curse of the Crimson Elixir, hopefully that one's gonna

327
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,040
be better than the first one.

328
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:29,360
Apparently curses are the big thing in the role playing games this year, we'll see.

329
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:34,000
Kingdom Hearts 2, I'm hoping for a playable, that'd be great, I wanna see a playable Kingdom

330
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,000
Hearts 2.

331
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:40,600
A Romancing Saga, can't say I'm a fan of the Saga series, yeah, sorry.

332
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,880
I tried, I tried too.

333
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,880
But Front Mission Online, they're gonna expand the online series.

334
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,680
missions like started with the Super Nintendo back when. Interesting enough

335
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,200
Squeenix is saying that they are we and we call them Squeenix we know it's you

336
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:59,560
know Square Enix or Squeenix but we call them Squeenix. On the PC they have

337
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:03,000
Final Fantasy 11 as a game they're going to be showing off very strange

338
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,200
considering this game is a couple years old now so they're are they gonna be

339
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:10,120
showing off the new patches or could there be a new expansion in the works I

340
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:14,680
hope so. I think probably patches and from what I've heard I know last year

341
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,920
They have like a ballista tournament type thing going on. I think this is gonna be the same tournament as

342
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:26,400
They're having some Hawaii location where it's kind of like boss battle type thing. Hmm

343
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:30,820
I think that's what they're doing with this one. We'll see I dose announced their lineup as well

344
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:37,680
what's going to be interesting is that they're going to be showing the games hitman blood money 25 to life commando strike force and

345
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:40,440
And, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend.

346
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,280
The life was last year too.

347
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,840
Well, that's another line up for this year.

348
00:21:44,840 --> 00:21:47,760
So, Lara Croft Tomb Raider Legend.

349
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,600
I thought that they had officially said no more Tomb Raider games, but I guess...

350
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:51,600
I saw pictures.

351
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:52,600
We would only be so lucky.

352
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:53,600
There are pictures online.

353
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,000
I just, I think Tomb Raider's done.

354
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,760
There are pictures online and Lara Croft has bigger boobs as usual.

355
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,400
I don't doubt that it's really happening.

356
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,960
I mean, Tomb Raider was such a huge franchise, but I think it's kind of done.

357
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,400
I have no interest in Tomb Raider.

358
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:12,400
you guess where those pictures are at? Where? MTV. Oh my gosh. Their brand new gamer site.

359
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:18,580
Yes, MTV Games launched this week. They have a brand new gaming site. They get pretty much

360
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:23,620
all their news from GameSpot. There's not a whole lot, but I guess we'll see what happens

361
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:30,620
with it. Yet another thing MTV can stop showing music videos for, huh? This is music television.

362
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:37,540
They should really change it to like pop culture television or something like that. I mean, how about to subliminal television?

363
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,540
I don't know cookie cutter TV. I

364
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:46,400
Think that there's better sites, but who knows they might do something to impress me later on. So we'll see, right? I

365
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,240
have faith

366
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:53,920
E3 also one last story. Yahoo is going to be doing a mobile

367
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,800
mobile show and they're going to be showing Yahoo poker. They're trying to do this whole

368
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:05,400
cross platform PC mobile thing. So that should be interesting, Yahoo poker, because Texas

369
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,720
Hold'em is the big thing right now. So we'll see.

370
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:13,540
All right, Orange Lounge Radio, we're not just here to talk about gaming, but we're

371
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:18,400
also here to better your life because you know, if we talked about games all the time,

372
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:23,660
we would have no time to go out and illegally gamble. So we're here to better your life

373
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:27,540
with some advice who better than Dark Sakura with her advice column and Dark

374
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:33,860
Sakura what do you have to share with us tonight today's bit of advice is how to

375
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:39,940
wrestle free from an alligator number one if you were on land try to get on

376
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:44,360
the alligators back and put downward pressure on its neck this will force the

377
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,540
head and jaws down number two close the alligators eyes this will usually make

378
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:53,360
it more sedate three if you were attacked go for the eyes and nose use

379
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:59,680
Use any weapon you have or your fist.

380
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:04,400
If its jaws are closed on something you want to remove, for example, a limb, tap or punch

381
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,560
it on the snout.

382
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:08,240
Alligators often open their mouths when tapped lightly.

383
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,120
They may drop whatever it is they have taken hold of and back off.

384
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,840
If the alligator gets you in its jaws, you must prevent it from shaking you or rolling

385
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:17,840
over.

386
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:20,780
These instinctual actions cause severe tissue damage.

387
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:25,180
Try to keep the mouth clamped shut so the alligator does not begin shaking.

388
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,180
6.

389
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:31,000
Seek medical attention immediately, even for a small cut or bruise to treat infection.

390
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:34,480
Alligators have a huge number of pathogens in their mouth.

391
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,480
But you know what I always say?

392
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,480
What?

393
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:41,680
Don't go freakin' swimming in the swamp in Florida!

394
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,660
Thank you for that.

395
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:46,900
Always lovely advice.

396
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,400
How many of you guys know, quick survey.

397
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:55,960
many of you guys actually played Neopets previously? Jamie's got her hand raised. Weren't you into

398
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:02,320
Neopets for a little bit, or at least your girlfriend was, wasn't she? My fiance is.

399
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:06,200
I played Neopets for a little while. I'm trying to think way back. I think the closest thing

400
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:11,920
I had that was close to Neopets would have been my pocket station. You know that Neopets

401
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:16,360
has been like this slowly like huge growing thing online and now they sell this stuff

402
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:20,680
at Claire's and all that stuff well you know a long time ago Sony said that they

403
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:24,080
were gonna make a Neopets game but then it just disappeared well guess what

404
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:29,740
it's coming out now or at least some new version of the Neopets game August of

405
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:40,000
2005 Neopets the darkest fairy the 3d action adventure will follow the

406
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:46,240
characters as they journey through the realm of Neopia so should be Neopets are

407
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:52,360
dead. So you're saying it's going to be a third person action adventure. You know what's

408
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:01,600
sad is almost practically every game coming out for the PS2 is action adventure. You know

409
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:06,620
what's funny is I had a customer, because I actually sell video games now, I had a customer

410
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:14,400
looking for puzzle games coming out for the PS2 or Xbox. Nada. I think there was one that's

411
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,960
coming out in like 2007.

412
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:16,960
Wow.

413
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,960
2007?

414
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:18,960
Yeah.

415
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,440
The console is still going to be going by then?

416
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,360
So here's what you need to do, developers.

417
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,560
Make more puzzle games for the PS2 and Xbox.

418
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:30,240
Well here's an interesting story that ties into that and the games that we used to play.

419
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,960
At least I know I used to play this, but this game got bigger and bigger.

420
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:37,140
Puzzle Pirates is now going to be, this used to be something you could only really get

421
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:38,360
on the internet.

422
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:39,400
It's going to be in stores.

423
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,140
It's coming out in stores this week.

424
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,480
It's going to be on the shelves.

425
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,840
So that's kind of interesting that Puzzle Pirates kind of got bigger like that.

426
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:52,800
And it's going to be selling for $20, monthly subscription fee $9.95.

427
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:58,200
Puzzle games you can see in Puzzle Pirates, sword fighting, drinking, sailing, bilge pumping,

428
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:02,880
carpentry, gunnery, distilling, and randomly they have spades in there.

429
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:07,080
And what's interesting about Puzzle Pirates is that it's like the Puzzle Fighter II inspired

430
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:10,140
game, the Bejeweled inspired game.

431
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:13,500
But I actually, I kind of had fun with Puzzle Pirates when I played it.

432
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,420
I thought the interface needed work, but again, before I get the hate mail from the Puzzle

433
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,020
Pirates community, it was like two years ago and they were still baiting it when I played,

434
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:24,340
so I'm sure a lot's changed and it's probably polished now, so I probably should go back

435
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:26,460
and check it out.

436
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:31,020
But I'm glad the game's been successful, I think it was a neat idea, but people are going

437
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:34,020
way too far with the pirate thing, like they have conventions where they all go and they

438
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,020
dress up as pirates.

439
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,020
Arr!

440
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,020
Yeah.

441
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,260
That was scary, like some of the furry stuff.

442
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:44,580
I don't know, worship Johnny Depp and stuff, I don't know.

443
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,900
Movie studios and their UMDs.

444
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,740
Hey, the UMDs are getting bigger and bigger.

445
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,180
Fox is very, very close to committing,

446
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,340
and the rumor is saying that their lineup would initially

447
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,620
include Dodgeball, iRobot, Super Troopers, Predator,

448
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,460
and Napoleon Dynamite.

449
00:28:00,460 --> 00:28:01,500
Hey, that's cool.

450
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,220
Universal, thinking about it.

451
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:06,460
Paramount is investigating it right now.

452
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,980
So UMDs look like it could be taken off?

453
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:10,780
Don't know.

454
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:12,460
Loki, I'd say you're the expert on this.

455
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,140
This is your industry.

456
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:13,800
What do you think?

457
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:14,300
Yep.

458
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:16,380
They're trying to go this route.

459
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,420
They're trying to push this stuff way too much.

460
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:20,300
I have not seen sales figures on UMD.

461
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:21,940
Is it really doing that well?

462
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,620
I don't know.

463
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,300
I'll be honest.

464
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:26,140
I mean, I haven't really had anyone requesting UMD movies.

465
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:28,100
They were just trying to push it on these people.

466
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:34,340
But honestly, see, because as far as PSPs go, rental-wise,

467
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:37,660
there's not that many stores renting games for that stuff right now

468
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,160
because they're

469
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:43,100
the market right now the people there they're not really going to spend the

470
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:47,660
money on these things uh... so it's not what i think probably after the summer

471
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,580
you're going to see UMD movies everywhere

472
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,700
but the thing is

473
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:52,700
and i still don't understand this

474
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:56,540
why are you buying a movie for your psp

475
00:28:56,540 --> 00:29:00,220
that you have on your have a dvd i don't get it either i don't get it

476
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:03,620
maybe they're looking for the portable convenience but you know what i've got

477
00:29:03,620 --> 00:29:07,940
portable convenience I have a laptop but even I could the only way I can think

478
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:10,780
that this would be probably better it's like you know those people that buy

479
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:17,220
portable DVD players then you can buy a PSP for your kids because they're you

480
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:20,340
know and then you know they have the movies too that they can watch but

481
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:24,340
nowadays too you also have all these SUVs and stuff with TVs in their car

482
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,420
really what it comes down to is kids need to learn to sit still and shut up

483
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:32,340
and sleep during car rides I have not heard anything about sales figures on

484
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,560
on the

485
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:37,100
i don't know how well they're doing but really what i think

486
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:39,940
i don't know if it's gonna take off though i i

487
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:41,040
really

488
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:44,340
i'm really worrying about this i mean cuz it's like people

489
00:29:44,340 --> 00:29:48,040
were telling me months back he added deviate just is going to be the

490
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:51,460
revolution is going to hit the video is removed

491
00:29:51,460 --> 00:29:55,980
and i said from day one of my this thing is going to fail faster than laserdisc

492
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:58,020
and what watch

493
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,180
and on

494
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,220
guess what

495
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:04,700
Uh, DVHS? What's that? Oh, that's right. It's not being made anymore.

496
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,660
I would really like to hear from our listeners. If you are somebody who is

497
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:11,060
supporting the UMD and you're buying movies on UMD, we want to know why!

498
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,580
Send us an email to go at orangelaundry.com. And I'm not, you know, we're not trying to say,

499
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,340
like, oh, you're a bad person for doing it. We just want to know, you know, what's, what's the

500
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,500
draw? What's the appeal to you? Because we don't see it. I mean, I got Spider-Man 2 with

501
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:24,300
my PSP, because I got the neat little bundle thing.

502
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:29,340
I would never see myself actually buying this, or paying for this, um, and

503
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:33,140
it really it I don't know it's just not anything I would spend money on

504
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:36,540
right I

505
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:40,540
dark soccer did you have anything you want to add? well I'm actually looking for

506
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,060
the sales figures I thought that there would be a financial report out already

507
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,340
but I haven't

508
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:48,500
found one yet here okay I'm sure we'll see something on the next one. Studios

509
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,820
here's what you need to be doing and trust me this is the greatest idea right

510
00:30:51,820 --> 00:30:52,260
here

511
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:57,340
because everybody at least this is what I've been using my you know large

512
00:30:57,340 --> 00:31:00,600
of memory stick for TV

513
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:05,720
episodes like for example perfect format for the UMD's

514
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,080
like Aqua Teen Hunger Force. But wait a minute couldn't you do the same thing with

515
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:14,320
DVDs and TV box sets? Exactly but here's the thing though

516
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,440
is not many people have the time to sit down and watch

517
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:22,040
a three-hour movie or two-hour movie you know on the go

518
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,960
you have like 15 minutes between your class you know 15 minutes here

519
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:31,840
30 minutes here maybe 15 minutes I watch my robot chickens and I watch my family

520
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,940
guy and there you go that's just enough time to sit down and watch this really

521
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:39,200
quick all right I see where you're going with that okay okay interesting idea

522
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,160
that's what I think they need to be doing TV shows instead of movies in UMD

523
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,800
format because the Internet's doing it already like you just said you've

524
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:52,560
already done it exactly went the controversial way about doing yeah I mean

525
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:57,240
But honestly, I think that's what they're going to try to do is an online service too

526
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,440
where you download media to your memory stick.

527
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:03,080
Are you saying you would actually pay for a service like this?

528
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,340
No, I would not pay for a service like this.

529
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
But most people would.

530
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,340
Hell no.

531
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:11,560
If you can do it for free, why the hell would I even pay for a service like this?

532
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,360
Lastly, speaking of movies and such, the Silent Hill movie has begun filming.

533
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,560
I'm a big fan of Silent Hill.

534
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,240
Dark Soccer, I know you're a big fan of Silent Hill.

535
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
What do you think about this movie news?

536
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,240
Tell us about what's going on.

537
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:31,240
Well, just checking, I'm actually using UpcomingHorrorMovies.com, they actually have a pretty good timeline

538
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:37,200
listed on the site, they have already started, they're in pre-production right now, started

539
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,200
some filming.

540
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:43,600
A lot of the scenes from the actual game are showing up in the movie, so they're definitely

541
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,540
having that tie-in factor there, it's actually already looking better to be, you know, better

542
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:51,100
associated with the universe than say the Resident Evil movies were but it's

543
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:56,580
looking very good so far they've definitely got the feel down so far on

544
00:32:56,580 --> 00:33:01,420
the cast they have I guess it's pronounced Radha Mitchell from Finding

545
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:06,260
Neverland as Rose who is the main character as her daughter they have

546
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:10,100
Jodelle Ferlin and as her husband they have Sean Bean who was Boromir in

547
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:14,460
Fellowship of the Rings and you we bowl is not directing this right oh no oh no

548
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,060
few I know I had I want to say it was the guy that did Brotherhood of the

549
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:28,940
Wolf yes Kristoff something I don't know so I I have I really have high hopes for

550
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,820
this and I hope I I kind of hope that a kiriyama mocha gets to be written by

551
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:37,280
Roger Avery does it say anything about who's doing the music I really hope they

552
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:43,140
get it off guns is the director is the direct ah okay um a production company

553
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:50,700
Davis films Roger Avery is the scripting makeup by Paul Jones who did Resident

554
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:54,780
Evil apocalypse that's just makeup I mean but he's doing the gore effects

555
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:58,940
that's cool that's cool all right so and the guy who did underworld is doing the

556
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,580
creatures well I guess although I don't know how much I'd want this movie to

557
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,780
have in common with underworld is 45 to 50 million dollars that's a lot of faith

558
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:14,940
in this movie. That's pretty cool. That's about $25,000 a day for production. I have

559
00:34:14,940 --> 00:34:19,700
high hopes for this movie. I really hope they get it right. I think this is, really we need

560
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:25,420
a good video game movie. We really do. Please don't screw this up, you guys. Pretty please.

561
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:29,740
I like what I'm hearing so far. I like that the folks have been on some of those big sites

562
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:32,160
saying that they're gonna... Because I think people need to know that video game movie

563
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:37,540
can be done well, then that way we both can get out of work. We'll see what happens. We'll

564
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,380
We'll keep you guys posted.

565
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,940
Anyway, we're running over, so let's wrap it up.

566
00:34:40,940 --> 00:34:42,900
Let's go around and give everybody's final words

567
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:43,740
for tonight.

568
00:34:43,740 --> 00:34:44,660
Oh, one last thing I did want to add.

569
00:34:44,660 --> 00:34:46,820
If you notice our sound is a little bit different tonight,

570
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,060
that's because we're actually in a new studio,

571
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:51,480
so we had to kind of redo everything.

572
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,640
We went through a move here locally,

573
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,060
so we redid all our chords.

574
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,060
So our sound is a little different.

575
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,180
Tell us what you guys think,

576
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,180
if you think we should tweak it or whatever,

577
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:03,180
togo at orangelaungeradio.com, T-O-G-O.

578
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,280
So you thought, though, that you got rid of something

579
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,380
from the old studio.

580
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:08,380
Oh no, you found it, didn't you?

581
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,380
Stuffed ferret.

582
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,380
Hooray.

583
00:35:11,380 --> 00:35:13,380
They found a way back.

584
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,380
I thought I buried that in the deepest, darkest box.

585
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:17,380
All right, anyway.

586
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,380
Final thoughts.

587
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:19,380
Logie.

588
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:23,380
I forgot to mention this on the three hour show that we do, but here's something I'd

589
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:24,380
like to mention.

590
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:25,380
Fine.

591
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,380
People, I went to see the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, the movie that came out recently,

592
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:31,380
and there's people wearing towels.

593
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:35,380
Now granted, I know that this is part of the book and people, you know, they're fans of

594
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:41,820
book and they want to dress up for stuff. I have a big problem with this. It's a movie.

595
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,060
It's not a convention. It does not require cosplay. I hate the people that dress up like

596
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,340
Star Wars characters. Now wait a minute, as someone who did Rocky Horror Picture Show

597
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,980
a couple times. Okay, there's a difference between participating in the movie and going

598
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,740
to watch a movie in costume. Okay, that's a little different. Okay. Okay. Star Wars

599
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,000
is not a participation movie. It's not a participation movie. It's like, and all these people dress

600
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:09,320
up and they're like in character and stuff like that and I have problems with that the

601
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:13,340
Matrix people and the Lord of the Rings people because you all do this and we have the Star

602
00:36:13,340 --> 00:36:18,640
Wars people with their lightsabers exactly I hate these people and they're so annoying

603
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:25,040
they are goddamn annoying and they just I get the bug me the hardcore people ruined

604
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,080
the Phantom Menace for me because they cheered at every reference I was missing dialogue

605
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:32,900
because they just would not be quiet I do have to say something in their favor okay

606
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:35,900
When we were in line for the Phantom Menace is actually better than the movie

607
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,180
This was at the theater in Roseville with the trees everywhere and people pulled out of line

608
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:46,100
Brought out their lightsabers and had an impromptu duel under the trees with the lights behind him

609
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:50,300
So all you saw was their silhouettes and the glowing lightsaber and that was better than the movie

610
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:55,100
You have to admit though. That's pretty good. You know what I was geeky, but it was off

611
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Do you think either one of them got laid that night?

612
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:59,100
Who cares? They were cool for five minutes.

613
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:05,100
You know what I love? I love the people that wait in line for like, you know, 30 days or whatever.

614
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:07,100
I don't even know how many days these people are.

615
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:11,100
And then what I would do is I would walk up past them and go,

616
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:13,100
Ha! I fandangled my tickets.

617
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:17,100
But they do it for charity, so you have to cut them a little slack.

618
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:21,100
No, no, no, no. Some people may do it for charity. Not everyone does it for charity.

619
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:24,100
Anyway, that was a heck of a final thought.

620
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
Alright, I'm done.

621
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:32,180
Sakura your final thought my final thought is I have a headache and my

622
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:38,980
final thought would be here take two of these all right thank you guys so much
