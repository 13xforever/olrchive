It's like that, y'all, but we don't quit, you keep on rockin', cause this is it!
The following live program is a special presentation of Orange Lounge Radio.
On tonight's episode of Orange Lounge Radio, episode 144 All three of us are back together again For the first time in a couple weeks And it's really the first time we're all together since E3 And although you guys are probably sick of hearing about it We're not done talking about E3 So we'll probably have a little bit more on that Only a little bit though, because we have other stories to move on to tonight Including what happens when Konami puts up a seemingly important poll
Of course, somebody's gotta go and fuck it up for everybody else.
We'll have more after this.
Orange Lounge Radio is presented in the TMI sound format.
You're listening to Orange Line Radio Live.
This is not a talk radio.
It's so much more.
Oh, God.
Call me Daddy.
Orange Lounge may contain adult content.
Orange Lounge may contain many four-letter words.
Orange Lounge may contain a scene of nudity.
Orange Lounge may contain plenty of... Just kidding.
Orange Lounge Radio will not contain any of that in this episode.
Well, isn't that special?
Orange Lounge Radio Live is a fully interactive program via our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com And now, here are your hosts for Orange Lounge Radio Live, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.
We are live!
And this is episode number 144! 144!
For this, May the 29th of 2005, you're tuned in to Orange Lounge Radio, radio that gamers really want.
And this is Orange Lounge Radio Live, your home for all the news and discussion on rhythm and music games, as well as the gamer community and the pop culture world.
We're plugged in and fully interactive through our website at www.orangeloungeradio.com.
My name is Rob Roberts, you might know me as Sky.
Joining me, as always, are my awesome co-hosts,
In this corner, the happiest bunny on the farm, say hello to DarkSakura, Jamie Summers.
Random News, and apparently they're taking a vigilante justice against online scam fights.
I've heard about that, and that's almost worth talking about a little later tonight.
I agree.
The intro does say we don't have to just talk about rhythm and music games.
This is why we changed my little script here in the beginning, because now we can talk about the pop culture world when we feel like it.
And we do.
Yeah.
Often.
Hey, I haven't introduced you yet.
Be quiet.
You're not here until we introduce you.
Not that Orange Lounge Radio doesn't ever get random anyway.
That's random.
That's why people know us.
No.
Alright, let me introduce the one and only Techmaster Loki.
I don't want to talk now.
Oh, I see how it is.
You're going to be like that, huh?
Exactly.
Fine.
Whatever.
Alright, we should have a... It's going to be a mediocre show tonight.
It'll be a slightly average.
You're never mediocre!
DJ Ranma S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I hope it's not the weird remix It's not that freaky remix that was on the I think so, I think it is
It's related to Dead EDR, so we have to give it its three seconds of glory.
Alright.
It's one of Miklatov's favorites, too, so if he heard you saying this, he'd probably cry.
I know, and I didn't like it.
Alright.
I like the original.
And I hate the Yorain remix, too.
Well, we're not playing the Yorain remix.
Thank God.
I don't know, maybe at the end of the show, just for you.
We'll see.
All right, so we got all that fun stuff coming up.
And, if you want to, I have some of the Dance Stage Unleashed 2 tracks.
Oh, yes, we have to do some of those as well.
Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, and, and, and, that song that I brought that's sorta kinda, it's Borderline Remix.
It's the Metal Gear Acid song, right?
Yeah.
Ooh, we gotta hear that.
I think a lot of our fanboys and fangirls would appreciate that.
They would like to hear it, and it's not quite a remix.
I kinda thought about remixing it, and I'm kinda on, you know... Alright, way to hype it up.
Way to hype it up.
It's really awesome, I just, you know, see what I mean?
It's one of those songs that's so awesome, it's like, you know, I don't know if I want to touch it, because I don't want to make it worse than it is.
See what I mean about tonight being a real, just average show, because Loki's just like, yeah, I got this song, it's okay.
It is never average!
Damn it, you're supposed to make us look good.
Alright, I know.
Well, I know I always look good.
And you're looking okay with that haircut.
You're looking average.
My haircut... Loki, you look okay.
Actually, Loki, you're a little bit below average.
But luckily, I'm here to bring you up.
My haircut is bad.
Ah, no, I like the haircut.
It's too short.
But it's very, very red.

Remember 2DX8 style Rainbow Flyer?
It's cute.
Yeah.
And we have Knocking at the Door so we'll figure that one out and we'll be back after this.

OrangeLoungeRadio.com It's 5.30 in your head.
No, it's not.
Damn it.
I hate it when I do that.
Orange Lounge Radio.
We're on the air.
What?
I hate when you do that, too.
I know.
You really buzz the shit out of me.
I really... I have screwed up the show so much.
It's okay.
But it's an okay show today.
Next week, we're replacing Rob with a tuna.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
Onion Flavored
Never any alcoholic drinks at the Orange Lawn Radio staff meetings ever.
Just onions.
So I queued it up to start at 4, so I had the whole playlist and my player program ready to go, and I started it at the top of the list.
Well, the problem was that the top of my screen wasn't really the top of the list, so I actually started at 4 o'clock, what was supposed to be at 4.30, and so everything ran like a half hour early, which caused a great panic when we got home from the staff meeting, and I realized, oh crap, the pre-show's almost over, but it's only 6 o'clock.
One of many ways I'm screwing up tonight.
Yeah, thank you, chatroom.
Chatroom's saying, uh, FIRED!
For me.
Thank you.
Appreciate that.
Um... Speaking of chatroom, www.orangeloungeradio.com Click on chat.
You should join us.
It's always a happy, skippy, good time.
We have a special guest who joined us there during the first break as well.
Can we get him a microphone?
Do I have to give him mine here?
The one and only Arcadian42, ladies and gentlemen.
Hello.
How are you doing?
I'm doing okay.
My computer's not.
That's why I'm here.
Wow, I'm liking this new studio because on the new mic you're actually really loud.
Alright.
Which is good.
Awesome.
I think he's loud only because we broke the mic.
Maybe.
You gotta watch the yelling tonight, Loki, because you might blow out somebody's speakers.
Oh no, I'll just get distorted beyond all hell.
I mean, because obviously you can't get louder than this, you know.
That's set to go.
So, whatever.
Alright.
We are going to get into How Is Your Week, How Is Your Day.
But first, I think it's very important that we do an Orange Lounge Radio News Update.
Because this is big news.
This is really big news.
Hey, this isn't a music update.
Orange Lounge Radio News Update.
You are too loud.
Actually, we're all too loud.
Effective...
May 28th-ish?
28th?
Earlier this week, effective earlier this week, both DarkSakura and I have quit Final Fantasy XI.
Yes, we have.
Got up and left and quit for good.
Yeah, screw that game.
Hey, screw off.
Leaving poor Loki all by himself in the world of Vanadil.
And he's enjoying every second of it.
Yeah, screw off.
Yeah, but we have PS Opium to keep us happy.
You know what?
And it's weird because I'm not even that into Blue Burst.
Like, it's cool and all, but let's face it, Jamie.
It's freaking PSO, again.
For the fourth time.
Yeah, but I can play it while doing my homework and actually get to a different window.
But Jamie, did they give us new classes?
No.
Did they give us new skins for our characters?
No.
Did they give us the type of voice support that Xbox Live had?
No.
Eventually.
Eventually?
They're working on it.
Okay, well we don't have it yet, so not yet, okay?
The only cool thing about PSO Bloober so far, other than the fact that it is PSO, and PSO is a pretty decent game, you can play it in a window.
So I can talk on aim.
Feasibly, you can cyber sex and play PSO at the same time, if you're into that.
Not that I would know anything about that.
Me neither.
Well, you can do that with Final Fantasy II.
In fact, you can actually play two sessions of Final Fantasy at the same time.
I don't know why you'd want to, but you could.
One on the PlayStation 2 and one on the PC?
No, two on the PC.
I heard about that!
But I, you mean, you know, and a lot of people go, how can they kill Morpheus?
Well, easy, here's how you can kill Morpheus, because you can make him come back, just like they're going to make Neo come back.
Well, and then the other thing is that, what are you worried about, a new movie?
Ha, not going to happen, sorry.
I know this is a newsflash to anybody, but the third Matrix movie sucked.
Therefore, there will not be any more Matrix movies.
Actually, correction, the second movie sucked.
The third movie was just kind of... Let's face it, as a whole...
It sucked.
It's kind of like Tonight Show.
It's average.
Comment from our chatroom there.
I'm apparently pissing off some of the Final Fantasy XI fans with my... Damn straight!
But see, here's where the kicker is.
Because he gave me all of his stuff, and he's like, don't sell this because I might come back.
First thing I did is sold all of it.
Ass.
Mic check.
And people wonder why I didn't give my stuff away.
I just quit.
That's fine.
Because when I come back, they'll have PvP.
I'm never coming back.
I've decided.
Okay, but here's the thing.
Somebody jaded 2005 saying, PSO and Final Fantasy, both are good, so don't quit one and go solely to another.
I'm actually not solely playing Phantasy Star Online.
I'm also playing Guild Wars.
And I'm going to be quitting all of it when Ragnarok 2 comes out.
Actually, here's...
Here's the idea behind it.
Guild Wars, a lot of my friends are into right now, and I basically got bullied into checking it out.
And I do like the idea that you don't have to pay a monthly fee.
I gotta admit, that's a big draw, because Final Fantasy XI, here I am paying $15.95 a month for three characters I'm never gonna use, right?
Why do you have three characters?
I had two of them.
And I wasn't, what, 18?
So I had my main character, my mule, and then I had a character on another server.
Because you can't server hop in Final Fantasy XI, so once you're on one server, you're stuck on it.
So, somebody who I've been getting to know lately happens to have a level 75 character and really wants to play with me.
Except he's on another server.
Well, he quit the game too, anyway, so it doesn't really matter.
So...
It's just one of those things where it's like, I've been playing it since October of 2003, I'm sick of logging on to the game every day just to farm because the economy is all fucked up because they won't do anything about the gill sellers.
I'm done.
I'm not having fun with the game anymore.
It's just, I'm sorry.
Is Final Fantasy XI a bad game?
No, it's one of the best MMOs I've ever played, but it's unfortunately just kind of starting to go down the tubes in my eyes.
I'm just not interested in it anymore.
There's probably things on there that still interest other people.
I, for one, am done.
I met some great people on Final Fantasy XI, though.
Is that the door?
Can you check?
You know, I just didn't have... And I don't like that you're pretty much forced to play with other people, because that pisses me the fuck off.
Yeah, who would want to interact with other people in an online game?
In an MMO.
Well, no, the thing I liked about Ragnarok and PSO is that I could solo all I wanted to, and if I wanted to interact with other people, I could.
Final Fantasy XI forces you to interact with other people.
How was your week?
How was your day, Dark Sakura?
I changed my entire function at work, so I'm having to remember shit from three years ago that has changed since then.
and it's just a big freaking pain in the ass.
On top of that, I'm still without my car.
Dan tried to hammer my fender back into shape and tore off my tire cover to try to get it to work or drive it.
Now my alignment is off to where when my wheel is straight, I turn rather sharply to the left.
You have a donut car.
That's awesome.
A car that does donuts.
Oh, yeah.
So my car is no longer considered safe to drive and I may be buying a new car, which is kind of cool.
E3 last week in Disneyland in my sunburn
DarkSakura, DarkSakura,
That's also one name away from Adam West, which makes it top of cool.
And his name is also a delicious dish.
Sorry, you're weak.
Another notable thing that happened this week is the release of Demon Days.
Gorillas.
Which made me very happy because I have the UK and the US version now, which is the same damn thing.
And of course, I was a big dumbass and didn't cancel one of my things at the time, so I have them both.
It's like a Game Boy.
I guess.
Totally.
It's like her buying Demon Days is like a Game Boy.
It's like she got the same damn thing but just like different shrink wrap colors.
She pulled a Game Boy.
They're actually exactly the same so the way that I have to tell the difference apart on them is because they have big fold over covers you know in each direction so you can have one of their faces on the front so one of them has Murdoch and the other one has 2D.
I've been squealy fangirl.
And my Japanese EP arrived for Feel Good Inc.
and it has a bunch of songs on it so I'm very happy.
I watched a ton of movies this week, none of which were any good.
I started it off with watching the original Star Wars trilogy because I have to get rid of the five movies out of the way.
Before Nelly will go see the third movie, and I want to see the third movie, but I'm not like, ooh, I have to go see it right away.
So I watched the original Star Wars trilogy.
Do you have the crap version or the good version?
I have the redone version, so... Okay, which redone version do you have?
The THX remastered or the ones with all the crap added into it?
All the crap.
I'm very sorry.
I'll copy my laser discs for you.
No, I don't want them.
Trust me.
I don't want them.
You have the crap.
I don't care.
I don't really care because no amount of crap added or subtracted from the last, you know, episode six, man.
What were they thinking, Ewoks?
Come on, that was the most retarded thing.
It was little Asian teddy bears that were attacking everything.
It was like a goddamn nightmare.
Jedi was my favorite of them.
It should have been Domo-kun.
Oh my god, that would have been actually cool.
Let me put my Star Wars fandom into perspective for you all, okay?
I got invited to a Star Wars marathon last night where they were going to watch the original trilogy in the original, I don't know, the good form or whatever you guys call it, back-to-back-to-back.
and you know, it was going to be fun and there's going to be, you know, food and stuff and it was with some of my really, really good friends and I said, no, I don't want to fucking watch Star Wars again.
That is my Star Wars fandom, ladies and gentlemen.
I actually really do want to go put in my laser just so I can get the bad taste of episodes one and two out of my mouth.
Let me just put it this way, I mean, it was, first off, Yoda was really strange looking as a puppet, and that was the best part, because it was just like, it was like the Muppets, that's what it reminded me of, the Muppets.
And the whole Ewok thing was just retarded, it's just, I was like, why the hell did he do this?
I just wanted, I just kept making fun of the movie the entire time.
And then, um, so anyways, watch that.
Then today, for some reason, I watched, um...
Running Man.
And the best part about that, and I didn't even realize it, is Richard Dawson is the goddamn host of Running Man.
You realize the average age of our listeners is like 15, 16.
Richard Dawson was the guy that used to be part of Match Game, and he was also part of the Family Feud back in the day.
He was actually a good host.
He's pretty funny.
But I just didn't realize, I'm like, dude, that's Richard Dawson.
That's awesome.
And then, for some reason, I watched Wild Wild West, or at least
Wild Wild West
That old one with Will Smith from a few years ago?
It's fucking racist as hell.
Like, they're just making, like, you know, the one guy calls him a coon, the other guy... Basically, the one villain doesn't have legs anymore, got his legs cut off or something, so Will Smith makes fun of him for being, you know, cripple, and then, you know, the other guy makes fun of him for being, you know...
Black Person.
And so, that was really interesting.
Oh yeah, that's so nice.
Anyway, so besides all the movies, actually the week was okay, I've been just doing more work stuff, you know, game accounts and whatnot, and then I was playing Final Fantasy XI, I'm level 58 now, my Black Mage, and that's awesome.
And that's pretty much it as far as gaming and stuff goes.
I was so bored today at Nelly's parents' house because they had their family over that is actually playing cell phone game Worms.
And for some reason, the AI always commits suicide, and I don't know why.
That's all.
All right.
Bradley, how was your week?
How was your day?
Actually, before I forget, I was at Dimple, by the way, and I found another Guitar Wolf something or the other, but I forgot what it was.
That's okay.
Bradley, how was your week?
How was your day?
Our week was all right.
Work went pretty fast this week.
Sometimes it's like really slow.
This week actually felt like it went pretty fast.
And then, yay, this weekend is the first full three-day weekend I get for the year.
This is good.
And then today, I was playing on here, and it stopped.
It went off.
That was because the power supply fan had been batty for the past year or so, and then it finally decided to stop, and then it burned itself out.
So I had to go to Fry's and pick up a new one and put that in.
And then when I restarted it, the network card driver died.
for some reason.
So it wanted me to reinstall, but my floppy disk drive doesn't work anymore.
It's been dead for two or three years.
So I came over here so you can see if they would probably burn me a disk or something.
And that'll happen.
And that's about all.
I played Devil May Cry because I've only played a little bit of that.
That's one of the games I got when I bought the PS2 from Jamie's friend.
I hardly ever played it.
I only played the first level until now.
That's it.
Alrighty.
My week and my day.
I went TV shopping yesterday because you know how sometimes when you have extra money it's like, oh damn, I got money to burn right now.
I gotta buy something.
So I had this urge to go out and buy a new TV because my credit card is at a zero balance right now so I'm like, I can afford to buy something nice for myself.
So I went to go look at TVs.
I really couldn't find anything
Http://bit.ly
Like, they have, like, somewhat reasonable HDTVs for, like, I don't know, $600 or something, but it seemed like one of those kinds that would break after a year, and I don't want to buy a TV if it's just going to break after a year.
And then the problem is, and I think this is why people are afraid to go up to HDTV, there's too damn many types of TVs.
There's the widescreen, and there's the plasma, and there's the projection, and the LCD, and then there's 4x3s.
It is too overwhelming, and I consider myself somewhat technically inclined.
I mean, I know how to, you know, do a radio show on the internet with friends, you know, but I can't figure out what TV I want.
Is that freaking sad, or what?
Well, stop watching TV, just download it all on your computer.
But see, this is the thing, I'm not buying a TV for TV.
I'm buying a TV for my DVDs and games.
Laser pointer for iPod?
No, I'm not getting a laser pointer for my iPhone.
No, I'm sorry, this just... Anyway.
You know, we actually are going to be buying a... We want to get a widescreen TV.
You know what all I'm going to use it for?
Video games.
Yeah.
And Dan's all like, I can watch this movie, I can watch this movie.
We haven't discussed a single TV show.
All he watches is that 70s show.
And all I watch is basically all day watching him play Fire Emblem.
Here's the thing.
Sure, I could tell by walking in there which one of those TVs was the prettiest TV.
Of course, that huge 52-inch widescreen LCD plasma super-duper HDTV was obviously the best one.
But let's face it, boys and girls, I'm doing a radio show on the Internet, not on New York over-the-air radio.
I don't quite have a lot of money to spend on nice TVs.
so I have to find something that's in the middle somewhere where it's a nice TV but affordable and I think just right now is a bad time for TVs because I think they're going to come down in price by the end of the year at least that's what I hope is that there'll be a price war this Christmas and they'll come down I even saw a story on Yahoo the other day it said they were going to come down in price soon enough so
Alright, anyway, so instead of getting the TV, I ended up buying a DVD kit for my Xbox because it's just a long story about the setup of our house, but I needed one, trust me.
And F Microsoft for having to, you have to buy a DVD kit to turn your Xbox into a DVD player, that sucks.
But I must admit it is a very nice DVD player because you can do Zoom and all that stuff, so it's cool.
I also picked up Fable for the Xbox.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura.com
That was pretty much my week and my day.
Going back to work this week was good because I got to get back into the swing of things.
It was kind of refreshing, believe it or not, to go back to work after being in LA for a week and stay out of place and everything.
So it was nice.
Let's move on to some Bomani-related things.
We are going to do a premiere of a brand new DDR Ultramix 3 song.
Funny enough, go figure, this is a song that originally showed up in our cage match.
And if you might remember DDR Ultramix 2...
D.D.R.
So, maybe our cage matches were something after all.
So tune in tonight because there might be a new DDR song in it.
Anyway, here's this new song that's announced for DDR Ultramix 3.
It was not in the E3 demo.
It was actually announced by the artist himself on his website, our old buddy Middyhead, who we interviewed a little while ago.
We've got to get him back on the show.
Because he's got not only this, but he's got the Jelly Kiss remix.
And he said on his site that there is something else as well.
So, here it is.
Midi Head, a brand new song for Ultramix 3.
You're going to be dancing to this one in the fall.
Raise Your Hands is the name of this song.
And we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio.
Thanks for watching!
Light in the mist as a DJ assist, shouting out to the fans Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands, raise your hands Raise your hands
Thanks for watching!
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Um, that will be edited down a little bit, and I think that's going to be a pretty kick-butt song when it's edited down.
I love the beat in that song, so it's going to be neat, I think.
Um, if they edit out the singing.
Burn all our bridges, alright.
Um... It was really good, honestly it was.
Yeah.
And it does sound better than Politary.
Mm-hmm.
So that's something.
Yep.
Alright.
So I wanted to play that for you guys out there.
Orange Lounge Radio giving you new Bomani music as soon as we can dig it up.
Play a new song from the new song pack from Xbox.
Actually, I think it's two song packs to go.
We're a little late on it.
But let's face it, boys and girls, at least me was in the middle of the move with the new studio and everything, so I didn't have a chance to get on Xbox Live previously and check out the song pack.
Although I have to say, after downloading it, I kind of dig it.
I like the new song packs.
So, good stuff.
Good stuff.
Alright, let's move on to something else going on in the Millennium community right now.
Kind of a big story this week.
A lot of exposure happening for the new games, thanks to E3, for the new DDR.
And of course, Beatmania is even getting out there.
Some people are kind of questioning, is this Beatmania thing going to catch on here in the US?
It was a big risk in a way Konami was taking.
Jason Ian has been trying to get Beatmania over here for a long, long time, and it took this long, finally.
Let's come out here.
In fact, Game Informer, isn't that Game Stomps Magazine?
Game Informer Online put Beatmania number 9 on its top 10 list of E3 showstoppers.
That's not bad when you consider you've got, oh, I don't know, three new consoles and new technologies and the new Zelda and everything else to compete with.
That's really a pretty good showing for a little game from Japan.
CNN, talking about Karaoke Revolution Party, as well as MSNBC.
Very interesting that Karaoke Revolution Party seems to get a lot of the attention, but, you know, I think for those of us not in the hardcore, I can kind of see where Karaoke Revolution is more of an accessible game, because everybody can at least try to sing, but not everybody can really dance.
Some people just can't dance, but everybody can try and sing.
It's a game you play with your voice.
So, because of all this exposure, Konami, for whatever reason, decided to put this poll on their site.
And so they're actually asking on their site, which upcoming music game are you most looking forward to?
Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?
Which one of these four do you guys think would be in the lead?
Oh, I already know the answer to this, but... Well, then let me ask DarkSakura, which one of these three do you think would be in the lead?
The list?
Karaoke Revolution Party, Beatmania, DDR Extreme 2, or DDR Ultramix 3?
Well, personally, I put Beatmania at the top of the list.
Beatmania is currently in third place with 4% of the vote.
Here's what happened, boys and girls.
There was a pretty legit thing going on where all the results were really somewhat neck and neck.
Beatmania and DDR Extreme 2 leading for a little bit.
And then...
Somebody decided to launch a script because currently DDR Ultramix 3 has 73% of the vote with 83,096 votes.
I think that's more people than are registered on DDR Freak, if I'm not mistaking.
Do you believe you're right?
So somehow this puzzles me.
The 83,000 people voted for Ultramix 3.
Yeah, right.
Yeah, right.
Somebody out there is running a script.
Why would somebody feel the need to run a script to put false votes in this poll?
For Ultramix 3, nonetheless?
I mean, don't get me wrong, I think the DDR Ultramix games are some of the best things that have happened to us forever, but we all knew, going into E3, we all knew that it was inevitable we would get an Ultramix 3 and an Extreme 2.
What we didn't know, we didn't know we were getting Beatmania here in the U.S.,
For the record, 53,163 members of DDR Freak.
Thank you.
So over 30,000 more people than are registered on DDR Freak placed to vote for Ultramix 3.
Right.
Yeah, right.
Let me see.
I bet if I reloaded this frame right now...
Oh, never mind.
They did stop running this script.
Okay, I don't see it anymore.
But for a while, some of the message boards were saying, dude, every time you click reload on the poll results, you can see that Ultramix 3 jumps up by like five or six votes each time.
So obviously somebody was running a script.
But why did you feel the need to run a script?
We did not know that Beatmania was going to be coming before E3, so this is something we should be backing.
Same thing with Karaoke Revolution Party, in a way.
I know it's kind of the stepchild of the Bomani series, for those of us that are core, you know, been into the games for a long time, but that sing and dance thing, we weren't expecting that, really.
At least I wasn't.
I was just expecting Karaoke Revolution Volume 4 with just, you know, more songs, same old shit, different game, right?
but now we get karaoke revolution party which is you know being a little bit innovative so that's kinda neat
But somebody felt the need out there to run a script.
By the way, somebody out there apparently decided that they're sad that Karaoke Revolution is falling behind because they're running a script for Karaoke Revolution Party voting as well, which is up to now 20% of the vote.
23,724 votes.
I somehow doubt that's legit, especially when you consider that DDR Extreme 2, which probably sells better the series Extreme than any of these games, DDR Extreme 2, 2,129 votes.
1% of the vote.
Yeah, right.
So do you think a Konami rep is going to look at this and go, yeah, this makes sense.
Do you think a Konami rep even gives a shit about this poll, honestly?
This is the part that surprised me, is that it was like the news on like half the Bomani sites out there.
Not that I blame them, because it is kind of cool that Konami's putting it on their front page.
But I think people read into it way too much.
I think people assume that, oh my gosh, because Konami put this on their front page poll, this is gonna make or break the future of Bomani Games.
No.
All these games were shown at E3.
All these games had press releases and release dates, even though some of them weren't so specific, release dates were attached to them.
Unlike some games shown at E3, Duke Nukem Forever, these games will come out eventually.
You had Duke Nukem Forever at E3 this year?
Years ago, they did.
I was going to say, wow, they actually had it shown?
You don't have to vote for this game over and over and over again for it to show up.
This poll is not going to make or break the future of the Ultramix series.
I hate to break it to you.
This poll is not going to make or break the Beatmania series.
So take a little rest in that, those of you guys that are pissed off that Beatmania has only got 4% of the vote.
Nobody cares.
You want to know what Konami cares about?
When the game comes out, they want people to buy it.
And you can't run a script for that.
So if you truly support the games, I hope you're going to buy them when they come out.
Because if not enough people buy Beatmania when it comes out, you know what they're going to say?
They're going to say the same thing they said with Guitar Freaks in Japan.
Fuck it.
Your thoughts on this.
Loki.
This is just an opinion poll.
Who gives a crap?
It doesn't matter.
It doesn't mean anything.
It's just... Ooh, let's see what the opinion is.
Just like on the Ear Freak polls.
I mean, come on.
Those don't mean anything.
It's the same damn thing.
And we don't want to belittle, and the polls on our website, they don't mean anything either, honestly, and I hate to belittle it, but the honest thing is, it's just something, it's a fun poll.
It's just, you know, how many of you guys in the room thought the last Star Wars movie sucked?
You know, and then, you know, you poll, and it's fun.
Oh, really?
Who knew I was in the minority?
It's a teehee fun poll, all these polls on websites.
This is in the MTV Video Game Awards, folks.
Oh, yeah.
You remember this years ago?
Halo and Dance Dance Revolution.
Didn't J-Dog from DDR Freak, of all people, write the script that did this?
For the... Like, remember... When was it?
It was either 2005... I want to say it was going into 2004.
Thank you for watching!
and in the end, according to the website, DDR was number one and we were all, yeah, DDR is going to be number one on the top 20 countdown, yeah.
Guess what?
When it was actually put out on TV, guess where DDR landed on the poll?
Last place, 20th, last place.
Your voting on the website didn't mean shit.
Now, the intentions back then were good.
I don't think that, anyway.
What?
No, finish your thought.
Well, the intentions back then were different.
Because MTV, that's different.
You don't know what they're going to do.
So I understand why people... MTV is synonymous with crap anyway.
Well, yeah, I understand that.
Their whole thinking, which was just insane anyways, was like, if it gets on MTV as number one, then maybe Konami will realize, well, the fans love it, and they'll put it on Arcade Mix.
Yeah, Konami will realize the fans love it when stores are sold out of it and you can't find it on shelves anywhere.
That's when they'll know.
For instance, Katamari Damacy, do you think we'd ever be seeing a sequel if that game wasn't impossible to find?
No.
That game is selling like mad.
That's why there's going to be a sequel to Katamari Damacy.
No MTV poll, no poll over at Namco's site or anything had to dictate that new game coming out.
Numbers, money, that's what they look at as the bottom line.
I think we've covered the poll thing enough.
I don't even want to dedicate this much effort into talking about this.
But it just irritates me that somebody, I mean, why would somebody do this?
They'd be like, hey, look at how big my internet penis is.
It takes up 73% of the screen right now.
Nobody will ever be as big as Jason's.
Recognize.
Just remember, if you think this poll is going to do any good, just watch what happened on the MTV thing.
The answers are already predetermined.
So this is what's going to happen if they allow internet voting for presidents?
Absolutely.
That's why it'll never happen, at least in the next 20 years.
But who knows?
I've been proven wrong before.
We'll see what happens.
How about a break time, kids?
How about it?
At least I liked it.
I don't know what my co-hosts will think, but I'm entitled to my Wii song once in a while, I think.
So this is Vanilla Ninja with Liar is what we're going to start off this break with.
And then also in this break, we'll play other stuff, too.
Some potpourri.
And then when we come back from this break, some more Bomani news.
Tonight's cage match, of course, your calls via the Skype line, www.orangeloungeradio.com.
Click on Interact With Us, and we'll start taking some calls via Skype when we come back.
Sound good?
Yeah!
Alright, we'll be back after this from Guitar Freaks, Drum Mania V, Manila Ninja, Liar.
I'm feeling about to feel in love, I'm really good at hiding on the road, you know
If you wanna lie to me again, the rhythm of your fate is on the end Just go there, and stay there, lie down
I'm feeling about to be in love I'm growing to the heart of all the world There's no way, there's no way If you wanna like me again Then if you want to take it all, yeah, just come with me
Can you be a fantasy?
Give me ecstasy Can you be a fantasy?
Thanks for watching!
And the heat of the night, the night And the heat of the night, the night Why did our feelings die in action When we fought for satisfaction But our hearts end at the well Save me
What?
The love of magic
Thanks for watching!
This is the way we rock, this is the way we ride, as we demonstrate, as we demonstrate.
From the steps wide to arms loud, this DDR sucks!
TGP-O
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and episode number 144 for you guys.
You know, it's kind of sad because it is a three-day weekend and typically on the three-day weekends we do our drunk shows, but you may notice we're not doing that tonight.
That's because Jamie and I are going clubbing after tonight's show.
We're getting our goth on.
Because we don't get to go out on Sunday nights very often, so we're going to go out tonight.
And Loki, well, I don't know what his excuse is.
Oh yeah, he drove over here so he can't really drink.
He'll go club seals.
Yeah, he'll go club seals instead of clubbing.
I'm going to have me some Guinness.
I totally want to drink at the club, man.
I can have one drink.
You can have one and then not drink anything for three hours.
That's pretty much what I get to do.
Drink a lot of water.
Because it takes, I think, two hours for a high metabolism to oxidize alcohol.
For a big guy like me, though, my body can handle a lot.
Lightweight.
You're lightweight and you know it.
Not anymore.
Not anymore.
Maybe in college.
Maybe before I was 21.
Oh yeah, hi kids.
I don't know, man.
I remember you falling out of the chair during all the drunk shows.
Yeah, I seem to recall the last drunk show we had.
I was lying down in the hallway, kicking the wall, trying to run up the wall, and I was yelling, I'm in the Matrix, I'm in the Matrix.
And I don't even remember how we got to that on our radio show, but this was on air.
I remember eating half a box of waffles.
Which I paid you back for.
Finally.
I remember you paid me back.
I bought you a big old box of industrial-sized waffles.
And they were eaten.
So we'll have to do another drunk show sometime.
I'm happy because I got a toaster today.
A bagel-sized toaster.
And I hate bagels, but still a toaster.
They're good for cooking waffles in.
Yes.
You know, my friend told me that he was going to get me as a housewarming present a Hello Kitty toaster.
I'm still waiting.
What the hell is up with Hello Kitty?
I swear to God, it's like...
It's almost like the Nazi Revolution.
I mean, it's like they have everything Hello Kitty.
It's just, Hello Kitty is going to take over the world.
Sanrio World!
Did you play the Hello Kitty Roller Rescue at E3?
No, but I saw you play it.
So cute!
So cute!
So cute!
I like the suggestion from our chatroom.
Drunk podcast episode!
Yeah, it'd be really great for us with all the additional exposure.
We could bring the recorder, though, to the club.
What are we going to get at the club?
Nobody talks.
It's Gothic night.
Nobody talks.
They act pretentious and ignore each other.
At the club.
Can you actually hear someone talking four inches away from you at the club?
Yeah, seriously.
Yes, boys and girls, Jamie and I go to the Goth Club on Sunday nights.
I go every week on Thursday.
Now, don't knock it till you tried it.
I know that, you know, a lot of you guys are in, like, high school, college, and you probably... Either you are a goth kid... You're emo!
Stop crying, emo kid!
Either you are a goth kid or you make fun of the goth kids.
So... Give him a break.
Honestly, folks, you should be dating the goth kids.
I mean, because they're the ones that later on down the road end up being really slutty.
Now stop.
Hey, I am only going off of personal experience, okay?
Okay, I knew a goth girl.
She wasn't very popular in high school, but she got out of high school, pierced like crazy, and then became a stripper.
Was she pierced?
Uh-huh.
Wow.
Every place.
But anyways, um, yeah, so that was actually the last time I went to the goth club was with this chick, and, um, because when I went there, then, um, some guy was trying to proposition me for sex.
Like, they wanted to take me home and give me money and
Have their way with me.
And that was the end of the golf club.
Have I ever taken you to the gay club?
No.
Oh, you need to go sometime.
I like karaoke there.
Even though I don't sing anything, I just watch.
I sing.
We need this to be like a mission.
We need to take Loki to the gay bar.
I know that Nellie wants to go.
I know she does.
I don't really care.
It's not like it's going to be like, oh my god, homosexuals!
Oh no!
I know you only lived with one.
I would just be like, oh whatever, I'm bored.
You only lived with one for how long?
Seriously.
You didn't catch gay from living with me, did you?
I don't think so.
I caught gay from you.
Remember the Pepsi bong?
This is years ago at our first March Madness.
And, uh...
It was Shiggle selling these huge things that look like a big bone, but I call them the Pepsi bong.
And I was passing it to Rob to take a drink.
I was like, I don't have any diseases.
And then he took a drink, passed it back, and I started drinking it.
And he goes, I do, I have gays.
I was like, oh my god, I caught gay.
And then I hugged Irene.
Yeah, very excellent point made in the chat room.
You guys should not tease the goth kids, you people that listen to the show.
You should not be teasing the goth kids.
You fucking play DDR.
Yep.
Correction, I do not play DDR.
I just do a radio show.
What, you play in the groove?
That's even worse.
I don't play in the groove.
No, honestly, but I think doing a radio show about DDR is probably worse than playing DDR.
Let me do a quick imitation of Jamie and I at the goth club.
Oh, Jamie, I'm feeling so gothic.
I'm so gothic, Jamie.
Okay, you know what?
That when the night comes, so do I. Jamie, I'm so gothic, bats fly out of my ass.
I could make a comment about that.
Let's go on the dance floor and swing our hands about.
Let's close our eyes and let our hands move freely above in the air and let the music flow into our body.
Let's see how many people we can pile in the cage.
Oh, I get so turned on by cages.
I'm gonna make out with that thing over there.
I can't tell if it's man or woman but it has a cute corset.
Oh, that's Jessica's purse.
I will make love to it even so I'm feeling so tragic I'm going to go outside and contemplate jumping off the curb I'm going to slit my wrists and then go to work tomorrow That's emo Oh, I'm sorry That's emo Anyways You know what I do?
I sit on the bench and get drunk That's what I do And then I watch everybody, I'm like
I'm too fucking drunk to move.
That's what I do.
The golf club for me is all about planning my outfit.
Because I get to be as eccentric as I want to be.
I'm thinking about wearing my I hate myself and I want to die shirt from English.com tonight.
Because that's always a fun choice.
I have my, uh, the one that you bought me.
Oh yeah, the reviver.
It would be fun to go to the golf club wearing all white.
People do.
I've seen, dude, you have to go to see the guy that dresses up like Michael Jackson.
that guy is my fucking hero one glove and the hat and everything and he fucking moonwalks to goth music that's awesome that's so weird that is awesome I gotta dress up like Pee Wee Herman and go there or something no actually no I don't sigh
Oh yeah, we talk about video games on this show once in a while, don't we?
What was that on Saturday Night Live?
I don't know, I don't watch that.
That was great.
That actually amused me to no end.
I think Sarah Michelle Gellar.
That one was great.
Robert Downey Jr.
was the one I remember.
Anyway.
That was great.
We're going to open up the Skype line now to try and steer us back on to talking about games.
I'm going to open up the Skype line, www.orangelandreda.com and click on interact with us.
Funny thing is though, okay, this is the other thing.
Before I got off on the...
Thank you for watching!
Also, what's interesting is that... Oh, that's the cool thing about the fact that my friend brought over Star Wars.
He brought me a big thing of vodka and I have orange juice at home.
Because it's part of a three-day weekend, Memorial Day weekend, we typically have less listeners on three-day weekend because people decide they can go out and get a life because it's, you know, another weekend night or something.
I don't know where you kids get off thinking that.
Wherever they can.
All right.
Well, the skypline's open, and I'm noticing, per our list, there's a whopping two people online, so I'm not thinking the skypline's going to be a good idea tonight.
We might have to go back in the goth talk again.
No, you know what?
We'll get Paris Hilton chat.
House of Wax just came out, you know.
You know, I heard that movie kind of sucked, but I heard that she doesn't die quick enough.
I actually had free tickets to that, and I threw them away.
I just want to download the scene where she dies so that I can cheat in the industry for making that.
I don't know why you would, because that seems like an awful lot of work to me, but I guess you could do that.
Have you seen the new Paris Hilton commercial?
Yeah, why are people getting an uproar with that?
It's just Paris Hilton being stupid and slutty with a burger.
Is it just me, or is she really the wrong person to be selling, let's wait here, hamburgers?
Does the bitch look like she eats anything?
No.
She seems more of like a sausage hot dog type person to me.
I don't know if she can handle... The burger is bigger than she is, okay?
Honestly, folks.
The burger is bigger than she is.
She'd be like, oh my god, can you cut that lettuce in half, please?
That is way too much for me.
Like, oh my god!
The whole thing was just an excuse to use her tagline, that's hot.
Which isn't even really a tagline.
Why does she have a tagline?
Why does she have a show?
All she's done is like, oh, there we go.
Saved by a phone call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Thank freaking God, stop the Paris Hilton crap.
Actually, it was kind of inadvertent.
We actually didn't mean to start doing the Paris Hilton chat, but I had to get that out about the commercial.
You could have spared all of us.
You really could have.
I'm sorry.
Hi, Jason, how are you?
Hi, Rob.
Now, this is the man with the internet penis, ladies and gentlemen.
No scripting on Konami polls needed.
He just keeps pressing the vote button over and over and over again.
Oh yeah, it's me.
I'm sorry.
No.
Did you write the script, Jason?
No.
Did you?
No.
Are you lying?
No.
Alright.
What's on your mind?
Um, I, well, I had Paris Hilton on my mind and I really wanted it out, so.
Who hasn't had Paris Hilton sitting on their head, huh?
Well, me until now.
Thanks, Rob.
I'm sorry.
See, now we're even getting other people calling in, but those people will have to wait because you're online.
No, it's alright.
We haven't talked to you since E3 was over.
What did you think of the old E3 and Konami's showing at E3?
Everybody was taunting me because I couldn't go, and it made me really, really sad.
Go tell them to go to hell.
Oh, believe me, I already did.
Oh, that's good.
That's mean.
That's a mean thing to do.
Well, you'll go next year.
It'll be fine.
Oh, damn straight.
You better.
I'll definitely go.
What do you think of Konami's lineup this year?
I want to see a full thing of the Groovaloos.
Oh, yeah, you know, I'm surprised.
There was like a minute-long clip that showed up on LiveJournal.
I know that Mel got a video of it.
Did Mel get a video of it?
At some point.
I don't know what he's doing with the video or where it went, but he got a video.
Mel works for us now, right?
So maybe we can hook something up.
Maybe we can hook something up.
I will ask Mel about that just for you, Jason, if he did get a video of that.
I'm surprised Shane didn't get a video of that.
Miklatov, Miklatov.
How many times did the Groovaloos perform throughout the whole thing?
I think it was like three, four, and three.
So it was like ten times they performed.
Mikltov was at least at seven of them.
At least.
I took a bunch of pictures.
You did?
Which you can see on orangeonjournal.com.
Oh, what a lovely plug.
Lots of Groovaloos pictures on orangeonjournal.com.
And the Q1 grinned at me.
He was upside down.
You're all cute.
That's a good reminder that our E3 picture galleries are coming online.
Get this.
We're only through two days of the show.
500 pictures already on the site.
And only one of them with me in it.
And we wonder why we're having bandwidth issues right now.
I smile every time I see an iPod commercial now.
Why is that?
Were you the one that told me that the Groovaloos were the iPod commercial mosaic people?
Yes.
That's what I was told anyway.
The Groovaloos are the iPod shadow dancers.
And the thing is that they are also going to be the shadow dancers in one of the new DDRs.
We never got a clear answer whether it was Ultramix 3 or Extreme 2, but one of them, the Groovaloos are actually being modeled.
Is it Ultramix 3?
That's what they kept saying at the show, but then I heard someone at the end say, no, it's Extreme 2.
So nobody seems to know.
Are they going to be the competitive dancers in the quest mode in Ultramix 3 perhaps?
What little bit I played of quest mode, it wasn't really set up like that.
It was very similar to Mission, in a way.
It was a thought.
Yeah, that was a good thought.
It would be an interesting one.
Very good.
By the way, also included in DarkSakura's pictures, tons of screen caps.
You want to see what the song banners for some of the new songs look like?
She got it.
Got all of them for DDR Mario.
Yeah, you want to see DDR Mario?
Go look.
It's all there.
Yeah, you people.
Go look at our website and don't put us over bandwidth.
Yeah, don't forget to look into that, Jason.
I'm working on that.
I'm already working on it.
Kisses.
All right.
Anything else you want to share with our listeners?
I just wanted you guys to stop.
That's fine.
We'll go off the air right now.
We got a goth club to get to.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
We got coffins to sleep in and, you know, familiars to cast and, you know.
Okay, you know what?
Stop talking about my private life.
All right.
I guess we'll hang up and let somebody else call in now, Jason.
I still want I Feel Toy Remix to be in Beatmania USA.
I think that would make a very, very good crossover.
I'll play I Feel Toy Remix just for you later, and you can imagine it.
How's that sound?
That would make me very happy.
All right, we'll do that.
Thank you, Rob.
You're welcome.
Bye, Jamie.
Bye, Matt.
Bye.
No, you cannot leave us.
You must come up here and visit.
Oh, God, I want to.
We kidnap.
All right.
Come to our dog castle, where we all gossip.
Bye, Jason.
Bye, Rob.
You know who the original old school goth is?
Elvira?
No.
One, two, ah, ah, ah.
Three, four, ah, ah, ah.
You know what?
We had Count Chocula, too.
Oh, that's true.
Count Chocula was goth.
Hi, you're on Orange and Orange Radio.
Hey, it's Dukes.
Hey, Dukes, what's up?
I'm bored and listening to you guys talk about the gods.
Yeah.
And it was so funny, like, as you guys were talking about that, I was watching, I was reading Maddox.
You guys ever heard of that guy?
Is that the one that makes fun of the preschool refrigerator art on his site?
Yeah, a lot more than that.
Yeah, that guy, that guy.
Okay.
Yeah, that's a pretty funny site.
Yeah, I was reading and he was talking about the gods, and it's so funny.
He just, like, destroys them.
It's hilarious.
I don't want to hear that.
Sorry, I don't want to hear it.
To be fair, we're only teasing, you know, we like everybody equally.
Except emo kids.
I mean, hi!
No, no, no.
I'm against emo kids also.
It's pretty funny.
Remember, down the road, not across the street.
I have a couple funny stories about the emo kids.
I know that, like, the arcade I go to normally, there's this kid who was just sitting on the ground, right?
And some cop guy just came up and told him, oh, you can't sit there.
So this kid just looks at the cop like, shoot him.
So he's like, God, okay, whatever, you know, I'll stand up.
And he starts, like, crying and runs away.
Like, what the hell?
You know what I don't understand?
This is one of those generational things.
This is when I really begin to feel old.
Because back in my day, they didn't have emo kids.
But this is why I don't understand.
Everybody says emo sucks.
Emo kids suck.
I've never heard anybody say, I'm an emo kid.
Leave me alone.
Nobody ever says, I want to be emo when I grow up.
Seriously.
Where are the emo kids?
Where are these people that suck?
I think you all are making fun of something that doesn't even exist.
Okay, no.
Okay, if you want to see the emo kids, just like walk around, I guess, like a mall or something.
And look for kids looking at the floor all the time.
Walk in the Hot Topic.
No, no.
When I shop at Hot Topic, they've got video game shirts.
Come on.
And cool pants.
You've got to admit Hot Topic has cool pants.
You don't have to be emo to know that.
Yeah, they're pretty cool.
And I don't even like Hot Topic much.
All right.
Anything gaming related you wanted to share with us?
Yes, I got a bunch of AAAs today.
I'm happy.
Oh, congratulations.
Now, how many new AAAs did you get?
I got AAA on Holic, AAA on Waka Laka, AAA on Sexy Planet, and I passed PSMO on Shuffle.
But that's not a triple A. You just passed it.
No, I passed it, but that's awesome.
Okay, yeah, I know, I know.
So that's four.
So, your DDR penis grew by a whole four centimeters.
How does it feel?
It feels great.
Alright.
Okay.
Alright.
I'll see you guys later.
Go hump something.
See ya.
Bye.
Bye.
That's wonderful.
I would, you know, Dr. Drew or something.
Yeah, go hump something.
For better.
Well, he's got his penis grew by four centimeters.
It's time to go hump something.
Maybe he saw the new parasol pin.
No, he AAA'd.
Weren't you listening?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I was looking for something that actually made, you know, I don't know.
You ever sign up for one of those sites like NNR or GrooveStats, I think is another one for in the groove.
Any of those sites where you can compare your DDR scores and you can issue challenges to each other and stuff like that?
Challenge 1, go outside.
Challenge 1, run around the track.
Hi, you're on Orange Lounge Radio.
Hello.
Housekeeping.
Welcome to my castle.
Candygram.
You are on the Orange Lounge.
No, seriously, you there?
Can you hear us?
That would be a negative.
Well, it's one of our regular callers.
Oh, he hung up.
If you kids are unsure if your Skype is working or not, give Echo123 a call, and you can always test to make sure your Skype's working.
You can't add Echo123 to your buddy list, but you can give Echo123 a call.
So give Echo123 a call, and you can test if your Skype is working and see what you sound like.
Amazing.
Because people are fundamentally stupid.
Well, I don't know.
I mean, a lot of people do this.
Like, if I were to sign up for something like that, I would do it for myself to track my own records because I believe it's the one place where In The Groove really is superior to DDR is the memory support where the memory card on PlayStation, that whole link thing, eh, not so hot.
But the USB In The Groove is awesome.
and so really with that you don't need a freaking website to track your scores but on DDR you kind of do so I could see myself signing up for a website strictly to track my scores on DDR to watch my own improvement because it feels good to watch yourself improve but the whole like challenging other people and like OMG I got one more great than you and all that stuff I don't get that who cares why who cares
No matter how good you are at DDR, or at 2DX, or at Poppin' Music, or at any of these games, or at goth dancing, or whatever, there will always be somebody better than you, somewhere out there.
You may not know it, but somebody out there is better than you.
And the person who's the best in the world, there's somebody better than them, at something else.
That was my motivational thought for today.
Regardless, somebody out there is better than you, so stop trying.
Alright.
Let's go to the cage match tonight, boys and girls.
We'll do more Skype calls later.
I think people are afraid to call in now because I wasn't really making fun of that last guy.
I mean, I was kind of congratulating him.
I don't know what your guys' problem is.
Wah, wah, wah.
Alright.
Um... We gotta go to the cage match.
But in order for me to go to the cage match, I've gotta find Loki's song that he wanted played.
I hope I can find it, or we're in trouble.
Do you remember what the file name was?
Um, I believe it started with a D. Uh-oh.
Oh, God.
Do I have to look it up again?
Maybe.
This isn't good.
It's two letters.
It starts off as something something and then dash.
I will look for that so that we don't waste too much show.
I'm going to reorder things a little bit.
Let's go into playing that song from Silent Hill 4.
And this is one of the songs that's in the new song pack.
I don't remember if it's song pack 10 or 11.
I think it's song pack 10 this song shows up in.
And it's really weird, you guys.
This is a really weird song.
And that's kind of the reason I want to play this.
They should put a dog song in there.
So that you can hear kind of how weird some of these DDR songs are getting.
So this is Waverer, the slide mix.
And we'll be back after this with the cage match.
DarkSakura.com
Thank you for watching!
Thanks for watching!
Waiverer, The Slide Mix
But you can't say there isn't a little variety in your USDDR games, so there you have it.
All right.
Before we get into tonight's cage match, I thought we'd go ahead and let Loki do a sim update if you have something for us, Loki.
That's a good question.
I don't think we do, though, but at least last time I checked, which was yesterday.
But let's give it a... Oh!
I forgot.
Actually, I forgot one the other day.
Not that you really care, but guess what?
Debt Mania, Alpha something or other, Release Candidate 3
And what can you expect in that?
I don't know.
Not much different.
But hey, it's a new version of Step Mania.
And you know what?
I completely forgot that they were even updating that thing to be honest.
Because it's been that long.
But yeah, new version.
Get it at stepmania.com.
Be sure to upgrade it.
And I think there might be a driver missing so you might have to download that too.
But it's not that hard to find.
I found it pretty quick.
But anyways.
Let's see what's going on in the sim scene.
Because I know as far as UK stuff, DDRUK hasn't released the official packs yet, but I think they're getting pretty close there.
They have to just tweak a few things on them, because they actually ripped all the music and the images and all that stuff using a certain program.
But let's see here.
Well, I'm not having much high hopes here for the fan mix stuff, but...
No.
Nothing.
Nada.
Pretty much Siberia Style 2.6 came out.
That was the one that was very similar to Techno Fiend.
I actually downloaded it and tried it out.
It's pretty cool.
It actually works with this release, Candidate 3, so that's pretty nice.
And then D3 Mix 2.5, four songs have been announced for that, but they haven't really launched anything.
And...
Really, if you want all the news, like, you know, up to date and everything, there's a website, B-Music Report, that you can go to.
And really, there's nothing there.
Ooh, wait a second.
Hold on.
Uh...
Hmm, what have we here?
Apparently, I would be wrong.
No, actually, they did announce something.
It looks like there's screenshots of FoonMix 2.
That's kind of neat.
Just basically some screenshots to show you what's going to be coming up.
And if it's not a surprise, it's up to the same quality as the original FoonMix, if not better.
So, take a look at that, and more to come soon enough.
Oh, a video.
There's a video of FunMix.
We'll check that out.
Videos will make great radio, by the way.
Well, I'm not going to play the video, because it's on a different computer.
But anyways, if you're interested, you can go to http://funmix.com
That's F-O-O-N-M-I-X dot nothing dot S-H.
I don't know what you know about these mixes here, but Laser123454321 in our chatroom is yelling about DDR9 Red has some early release version that's out.
DDR9 Red is basically the 2DX Red skin for, or theme for...
Stepmania, and DDR Extreme VS4.
I don't know what that one's all about.
It's just a DDR Extreme skin.
Oh, fun.
More skins.
Skins, skins, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Honestly, folks, stick with Siberia style 2.6.
It's the best one out there.
Alright, let's go into tonight's cage match boys and girls.
www.orangeloungeradio.com
Last week, we didn't have a cage match actually.
For the first time in about 100 episodes, we did not hold a cage match of any sort because we were too busy talking about E3.
So, by default, this song ended up getting a second week in rotation.
Imagine that.
So, we'll see.
Will it survive one more week and get closer to retirement?
On a personal note, I really hope not.
But we'll find out.
Darth Punk is song number one.
Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
You voted it in, here it is, a clip, because it did win last time.
And then you'll get to hear two new songs in their entirety.
Here it is, Ted Koppel, Gin & Juice.
Ain't leaving till six in the morning.
So what you wanna do?
Shit, I've got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too.
So turn off the lights and close the doors, but... Yeah, so we gon' smoke an ounce to this.
Jeez up, hose down while you motherfuckers bounce to this.
I'm Ted Koppel, and this is Laid Back.
Sources close to the White House today confirm that the president is laid back.
Now that I got me some Seagram's Gin, everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in.
Now this types of shit happens all the time.
You gotta get yours, but fool, I gotta get mine.
Everything is fine when you're listening to the T.E.D.
I got the cultivatin' music that be captivatin' he who listens.
To the words that I speak as I take me a drink to the middle of the street and get to mackin' this bitch named Katie.
Katie, correct?
She used to be the homeboy's lady.
Oh, that bitch?
Eighty degrees when I tell that bitch, please raise up off these NUTs cause you get none of these at ease.
As I mob with the dog pound field that breathes biatch, I'm just.
Earthquakes rocked Tokyo, Japan today as residents were laid back.
Residents in a small New England town are terrified as a mass murderer is laid back.
All right, that was a clip of song number one, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
Didn't that originate on something awful?
I'm getting a nod, yes.
Yes, it is.
Oh, that site's fun.
I hated putting that into the fortune cookie so many times.
That site is fun for the whole family.
It is.
Yeah, definitely.
They should be showing that website in Mormon churches everywhere.
All right, let's move on to song number two.
Song number two is my pick, my pick.
And I picked this song because it's a cover of ABBA.
and I can't get enough ABBA covers.
And this is actually from a new song.
I think it's supposed to showcase like unknown dance artists because it was called like Future Dance or something like that and I never heard of anybody on the CD.
And this mist was actually pretty good.
I kind of liked it.
It's a little different considering the original song is very slow.
I like what they did with this.
So this is DJ Tom Del Sar with The Winner Takes It All, 2005.
Enjoy.
Thanks for watching!
Thinking I'd be strong then But I wasn't true Playing Bible Groove
Like I used to kiss you Does it feel the same When she calls your name Somewhere deep inside You must know I miss you But what can I say Rules must be obeyed
I don't wanna talk If it makes you feel sad And I understand You've come to shake my hand I apologize If it makes you feel bad Seeing me so tense No self confidence But you see
The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all The winner takes it all
Alrighty, that's song number two in tonight's cage match.
DJ Tom Del Sar, the winner takes it all, 2005.
Did that song take it all, or are you gonna, uh, I don't know, take a crap on it?
I don't know, let's see.
DarkSakura!
That song was really good for me to take a big ol' shit on.
I mean, it wasn't too bad.
It's, again, trance.
A very generic trance mix of that.
And the original was so good, I guess, you know, I like ABBA.
But that gets a five, it was just mediocre.
Not exciting.
I could have sworn I've heard that song before, like, just as another transfer.
It's very similar to Erotic's version.
It's not, they do some different things with the vocals, but it's somewhat similar.
That just didn't do much.
It's just average.
It's a six.
Bradley.
Yeah, I'm set, Carter Fields.
I like it, it's ABBA, and since ABBA's a bunch of fuckers and they're never gonna reunite, that's the best thing we're gonna get, so, um, I like it, my only issue with it is I think it's a little bit long, which is kinda weird, because the original song was long, and that was fine, but this one was just a little too long for me, so...
I give it an 8.
Alright, let's go on to song number 3, DarkSakura, what did you pick for us tonight?
I've been wanting to put this song in the cage match for the past three months.
Finally, now that Demon Days has been released, I can legally put this song in the cage match.
So it's Gorillaz with Dare, which is actually going to be the next single.
Alright, here it is, a sneak peek at the next single from Gorillaz, and it's Jamie's cage match pick, Dare, song number 3.
Enjoy!
It's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out, it's coming out.
It's there.
It's there.
You've got the pressure on you.
You just...
All right, song number three in tonight's cage match, Gorilla's Dare.
I dare you to tell me if you liked it or hated it.
DarkSakura.
Ten.
Of course.
Gorilla's.
Any reason?
Actually, this is one of the better tracks on the new CD.
It's definitely the most upbeat track on the whole CD, because most everything else is really dark, but this was really cool, and it was, uh, what's his name from the Happy Mondays?
One of the other collaborators on that track.
Pretty cool.
Alright, uh, Loki.
It was pretty funky.
I give it an 8.
That's it?
Funky?
8?
That's it.
Alright, Bradley.
I like the gorillas.
On one track it didn't really catch my attention very well.
I'll give it a 7 for now.
You know what?
I actually really like that song.
And if I think more of the Gorillaz music sounded like that, I'd probably be as much of a fan as Jamie is.
So I kind of wish they'd do more of that sound.
So I'm kind of excited that it's the next single because some of the remixes ought to be good.
So I will give that song...
At the same time, though, I'm starting to get a little burned out on gorillas and gorillas-related things in the cage match.
So I really hope... I've been waiting for three months to put that together.
I know.
And by the way, it was Shawn Ryder.
That's why I'm going to give it a bye, and I'm not going to dock at any point.
So I'm going to go ahead and give it a nine.
Alright, let's go ahead and recap, and then it'll be your turn to vote.
So here it is, the three songs you can vote for tonight.
Song number one, last week's winner, Darth Punk, Ted Koppel's Gin and Juice.
Today confirms that the president is laid back.
Song number two, DJ Tom Delsar, The Winner Takes It All, 2005.
And song number three you can vote for tonight is Gorilla's Dare.
All right, place vote now.
Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote for song number one, song number two, or song number three.
We'll tally them up and let you know who won.
So send that private message in now.
You don't have much time.
No dilly-dallying.
Yes, Loki.
I'd like to mention I did watch the video.
It's of a new song called Manhole, and that's like, you know, manhole in street, not as in, you know, something else.
Anyways, oh man, Food Mix 2 looks awesome.
The interface is really cool, and the videos are just about as good as they were last time, so definitely one to try out once it comes out.
But in the meantime, you'll just have to live vicariously through the video.
The weird thing about that video, on what website can they get the video on?
This is on, uh, it's http://foodmix.nothing.sh And there'll be a link on top there, it'll say, um... So that's foodmix.nothing.sh Yeah, that's shh, shh, shh, it.
Exactly.
And they basically have a 20 meg video you can download, plus five screen captures.
And you can check out the brand new song, which is pretty good, but I didn't get to listen to it when it was playing because we had other music going at the same time.
But it looks pretty cool.
And go check it out.
Now, what amazed me most about that video, the little bits that I saw kind of watching over your shoulder there, is that it appears that it has solo steps.
Well, yeah.
How many people actually take the time to create solo steps?
Oh, now you're playing it over there, huh?
Well, I'm playing the music, but it's got this, like, little pig bunny thing running around the background, and it looks pretty cool.
I really like the way Foon Mix is put together.
I think it is one of the superior mixes.
Of course, I haven't looked at a whole lot, but I think it is one of the better ones out there.
This is a weird song too.
Can you put the mic up to the speakers so they can hear a little bit of that?
Interesting.
A little funky.
What's the name of that song?
Manhole.
That's just bizarre.
Manhole.
And look, it's a manhole.
Yeah, there's a manhole, but what's great, though, is I'm going to fast forward it here into the end.
Tee hee.
Manhole.
But they have a really cool thing.
Like a little spinny flower thing, and then...
And then they have like, they're just the backgrounds and stuff.
They have a lot of animation going on the menus and stuff.
And that's what's pretty cool about it.
I think at least.
It looks pretty cool.
Anyways, so just go check it out.
Alrighty, last call for cage match votes.
Get those in right now or your vote won't count.
I don't think we talked about this a whole lot last week.
Pump it up.
The brand new thing coming out there.
Mad Catz is publishing it.
A whole shitload of songs is going to be in the new release of Pump It Up coming out here in the U.S.
Now, I know a lot of the DDR Freak people went and got to take a look at this.
Did you go to DarkSakura?
No.
Oh.
I don't care about Pump It Up.
Oh.
I would have gone just to check it out, but okay.
But what about Run To You?
It's not even in there.
What's the point anymore?
They've drained the lifeblood from Pump It Up in the form of Run To You.
I recommend that for the next break, by the way.
At least they have Beethoven's Virus.
Beethoven's Virus is a really... People whore the shit out of that song, but it's still really good.
It's kind of tough, too.
And they do have Funky Tonight.
So that's kind of cool.
Yeah, but no DJ Doc.
But this is what's really interesting.
They actually put K-pop in a U.S.
release.
I think that's kind of neat.
I don't know why, but I think that's neat.
But of course, then again, if you look at DDR, they do have some J-pop songs.
They don't bother translating, like, the B4U stuff, you know, which is kind of neat.
Need to put in, like, you know, some more M-flow.
You know, it's not K-pop.
Well, this is really weird.
And then they mix that with U.S.
pop.
Elvis, A Little Less Conversation Why does A Little Less Conversation have to be in every single music game?
I don't know.
Earth, Wind & Fire, Let's Groove, The Crystal Method, Name of the Game Okay, that's pretty awesome.
Sugarhill Gang, Rapper's Delight
I am glad that they have... That's actually pretty sweet right there.
And then a bunch of other songs I've never heard of.
They need to put Name of the Game in fucking DDR.
Make like a hardcore DDR mix.
Didn't they have Busy Child?
Or what song was in Max 2?
Was it Busy Child?
It was Busy Child.
But Name of the Game has, you know, the kick-ass...
Name of the game.
That song needs to be in Beatmania.
If you want to put licensed songs in Beatmania, that song right there.
Because it has tons of crazy scratching.
And it would be perfect.
Perfect.
Alright.
You kids want to hear who won tonight's Cage Match?
Yes, please.
Yes, let's.
Alright.
It was another one that came down to one freaking vote.
So if you think your votes don't count, you're full of crap.
Your votes count more than the US elections.
Your votes count more than any of ours, too, remember.
Because even though we rate the songs here, we go all Simon Cowell on them, they don't really count in the end.
It's your votes that count.
So the winning song by one vote... Oh, yes, I want to mention something real quick.
Since you mentioned Simon Cowell, a brand new American Idol type thing that's going to be going on, but dancing this time.
Oh, hooray!
I'm so excited.
Do you think any DDR players will be in on that?
Nope.
No.
Alright.
I just thought I'd mention it because, you know, one, it delays finding out who won, and two, it sort of had, you know, you know, a little bit of... Can I get to the cage much longer now?
I guess.
Gorillas.
Dare.
I love you, chat room.
One vote over the ABBA cover.
I love you, chat room.
Hey, good.
People had the good taste not to vote for Ted Koppel.
Yes, Ted Koppel.
And then on the other side of that, the Ted Koppel song got one vote.
I wonder who voted.
We need to find that person and beat them upside the head with a wet roll of newspaper.
They actually said in their vote, and I already closed the window so I forget who did it, but they actually said in their vote, I'm voting for it because nobody else is going to.
How prophetic.
We have ourselves a psychic in here.
All right.
Okay.
I am happy.
I am pleased as punch, to quote an old expression from the 50s, I am pleased as punch that gin and juice is out of there now.
and the heavens parted and the choir of angels came forth and said, woohoo!
Loki, don't you ever do that again.
Oh, don't worry.
It's coming back.
I'll stick the puppy dogs on you.
Oh, we'll make a remix of that in Girls or something, you know.
Oh, Christ.
No, anyways, speaking of remixes.
Let's go to a break, boys and girls.
Let's play my song!
Yeah, let's play, what song am I gonna play?
I was gonna do the dancing stage stuff, but we can do your song.
You can play the dancing stage stuff then, that's fine.
Alright, what song, oh, all of these on here that I haven't...
Okay, wow.
Okay, so we got this Blondie song.
Well, here, here, I'll pick some good ones out for you.
Okay, please do.
Okay, let's do... Is this the, oh, is this that song that I think it is?
It is.
Yes, I want that one.
Except there's no, not really many lyrics in that.
And then, um, Get It On.
Okay.
That'd be good.
And... So we're gonna play I See You Baby, Get It On.
And maybe, um, Some Girls Are Supergirl.
Yeah, that's supergirl.
And then we'll do four, so alright as well?
Um, oh, oh, oh, um, actually Circles.
Okay, so we're going to hear music, and what's the name of this game again?
Dancing Stage Unleashed 2, it's your European version of Ultramix 2.
Oh, very cool, very good.
Alright, here it is, started off with I See You Baby, and then we're going to get into Get It On, that sounds hot, Some Girls, and Circles, so this is the Europe version of Ultramix 2.
So let's see if it is yet another release over there that has better songs than us.
We'll see.
Probably.
We'll see, here we go.
We'll be back after this.
This is the house that Funk builds.
Group of Mata style.

Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.
Orange Lounge Radio.
Packed Guns.
We're back, boys and girls.
So what do you think?
Did the Brits get better on the Xbox second mix?
Sounds a lot better.
They got some fun stuff.
You know what?
I agree that they have some fun stuff, but I don't think they have it any better.
I just think it's the same.
I prefer that to... I'm not going to say it because I'm nice.
Loki?
I don't know.
I like some of their club music, but I don't like the Blondie.
Blondie can stay far away.
Blondie's cool.
Yeah, Blondie's cool in the 80s.
Blondie's not cool now.
I don't know.
Remember Maria from the late 90s when they reunited?
Maria!
That was a neat video.
I don't know, I actually do think the top of Blondie's popularity was about Rapture.
Rapture.
That's a little stupid rap about the aliens.
Do you know that Rapture was like the first rap song or whatever to top the billboard or something like that?
It like was a pop song that had rap in it.
I know, but they say it was the first rap song to ever top the charts.
I'm like, dude, when I think of rap,
I don't think a Debra Harry.
It's all about Grandmaster Flash.
I think a Tupac.
No, no, no, no.
You need to go older.
It's all about the message.
How about Flava Flav when he used to wear the huge clock around his neck?
I had some Public Enemy in the pre-show.
I know, I know.
I put 911 as a joke in there.
Flava Flav!
Then he started hanging out with Brigitte Nielsen, who wondered about the house naked.
That was my Flava Flav impersonation, by the way.
Flava Flav!
Okay, I'm going to go hide behind the chair now.
Come on, tell me that's not a good impression.
FLAVOR FLAVE!
What's the first two?
That's a good question.
In what sense that's used on web portals?
Ginormous was number one and Confuzzled was number two.
Me so Confuzzled.
Followed by Chillax.
What the hell did they scan?
I've never heard that one.
Chillax, which means chill out slash relax.
I'm going to go chillax.
Never heard it.
Cognitive dysplasia.
Where the hell did they get these words?
Did they scan people's live journals or something?
No, it was a contest.
DDR freak!
Cognitive dysplasia was the feeling that you have before you even leave the house that you're going to forget something about...
You're right.
That's a total DDR freak post.
Cosmic is actually a word.
Can someone explain for me why they won't put Japanese songs on American DDR?
I'm so confuzzled.
I don't know.
Then they have... OMG reads back.
Followed by number six is gription.
You know, my tires need gription.
Phonecrastinate means putting off answering the phone until it displays on caller ID.
Slickery.
Having a surface that is wet or icy, Snert, snow that is dirty, and Linguini, a person incapable of producing neoglyisms or something.
Alright, who cares?
Whatever the hell it is.
You know what?
That was stupid.
Skype line's open, boys and girls.

Click on Interact With Us.
If you're really confuzzled at everything that's going on... You have cognitive dysplasia.
I like that, um, you know, those two words there.
And if you've ever tried to eat and snert, if you've ever tried to eat snirty, if you've ever tried to eat yellow snirty, we want to hear from you.
Snert's not a fucking word.
Who the hell comes up with this stuff?
I've never heard anyone use the word snert ever.
Ever.
Ever.
Alright, be quiet, we got a call.
Hi, you're on Orange Lawns Radio.
Hey.
Hey, what's up?
Who's this?
It's BlackDevilRx.
Hello, BlackDevilRx.
What's on your mind?
Confuzzled should be stricken from the English language forever.
You know, I tend to agree.
Confuzzled is kind of a weird word.
I'm trying to think of other things I see in blogs way too much that ought to be banned.
Like what?
I don't know.
How about just... How about overusage of exclamation points?
I don't know.
Hmm.
How about LeetSpeak?
I want the number 3.
Just the number 3 to be banned.
We'll go around and break everybody's 3 keys so they can't type Leet.
They can't use LeetSpeak at all.
They'll just do 2 plus 1.
Anything on your mind gaming-wise?
No, not much.
I'm kind of waiting for UM3 to come out.
Oh yeah, Ultramix 3?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
What did you think of the Midihead song we played earlier?
Oh, it was awesome.
I love Middyhead so much.
He's good stuff.
Good stuff.
Black Devil Rex.
Ooh, hi.
Hello.
So how can you tolerate the not staying on key, sounding like a gargled gravel?
Um...
Sorry, I don't know, it's probably this mic system I have, it's really old.
No, no, she's not talking about you.
I'm talking about me.
Okay.
Kind of misunderstood there.
I realize DarkSakura can be pretty blunt with people, but she does have tact.
Your voice sounds like crap.
No, I'm not that bad.
I don't know.
I'm gonna be nice.
She's making fun of Midi Head.
Nice.
I'm not making fun of him, I just don't think he can sing very well.
He should get somebody who can sing.
Well, he sold records and CDs, and he makes money.
It's always Paul and Terry, but what's her excuse?
You gotta go out and buy a MIDI head CD.
You know, people still buy, you know, crap like Britney Spears, and she can't sing either.
Touché.
Oh, worse than that, people watch that freaking show on UPN.
What is it, Britney and... No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, stop, stop, what?
Nobody watches UPN.
Ever.
Wrestling's on?
Uh-uh, uh-uh.
I watch Girlfriends every Monday night, okay?
I'm just kidding, I don't.
But I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
Oh my god, I just watched the WB.
Oh god.
Excuse me, weren't you a Buffy fan, if I recall?
I like Buffy, and I only watched UPN because Buffy went to UPN.
I don't like Angel.
I don't like Angel.
Angel's a whiny bitch.
Anyway, before we got there on TV chat, what was that?
Oh yeah, the Britney thing.
Apparently on this show, what?
Nothing?
I thought we were talking about MidiHead.
I'm just laughing at what she said.
How did we get from MidiHead to UPN?
Hold on, I'm not done talking about Britney Spears yet.
Britney Spears, apparently on her show, reveals herself to be a total nymphomaniac.
Like she always talks about sex.
That would be hot if she wasn't pregnant.
But since she's pregnant and fat and nasty... And she's smoking too, right?
She's a fucking baby killer.
And that would also be original if Madonna hadn't done it 15 years ago.
You can't have a baby genius.
The baby needs to grow up to be a pop star, so she has to smoke at an early age.
Well, her little sister's giving it a go.
I have a friend who went to high school with Britney Spears.
In New Orleans.
I'm sorry.
So was he.
Anyway.
Hi, Black Devil Rex.
You called to talk about games?
Still here.
This is what we do to our callers, don't worry about it.
Yeah, so hopefully no Britney on Ultramix 3, although the Extreme 2 kids are getting some Britney, but it's going to be covered.
Huh?
People got angry.
Oh my god!
Oops, I did it again!
and Ninja Rep.
Yeah, Ninja Rap.
It's up there.
It's up there in the big pile of suck.
Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go.
Oh, and you know what rhymes with Go Ninja, Go Ninja, Go?
Konami, Konami, Yo.
I know, that's what I was thinking.
I swear to God, at E3, the announcer guy would be, Konami, Konami, yo!
And then they'd all of us going, I was just moving my mouth going, this sucks, this sucks, yo.
And I was thinking, go ninja, go ninja, go!
I just said, ninja, ninja rap.
Thank you for depressing us, BlackDevilRx, with your phone call.
You're welcome.
You are so welcome.
We like some distraction here.
You're getting us in the mood for the goth club.
Digression is our middle, no, lounge is our middle name.
I'm going to wear all black, and I'm going to listen to depressing music.
I'm Osriel, the Prince of Sorrow.
Okay, the joke is about an hour and a half ago.
Goth Talk still cracks me up.
I'm on joke Hawaiian time.
Hey, our caller's trying to speak.
Let him speak.
No, no, no, no, no.
I'm just, no.
I'm finished.
You don't want to speak?
Well, you could sing or something.
I don't know.
Sing.
Serenade us!
I command.
He's making fun of goth people.
I can't hear him.
He's saying keep making fun of goth people.
Yeah, you're getting quiet all of a sudden.
We're not making fun of goth people.
We're making fun of people who make fun of goth people.
Like you.
Wow, that was nice.
Hi.
All right.
We're going to let you go before DarkSakura says something really mean.
Honestly, we're not having an Asian drink.
I'm not being mean.
Am I being mean?
No.
See?
All right.
You got served.
Wow, that joke was like a couple years ago.
I know it was great.
All right, BlackDevilRx, you're bringing the show down.
I need to let you go.
Okay, fine.
No, I'm kidding.
What do you want to say?
Go beat Mania U.S.
Yeah, I agree.
Go Beatmania US.
Go right on the store shelves and into my house as soon as possible.
Shut up, Jamie.
Alright.
Have a good one, BlackDevilRx.
We'll talk to you later, alright?
Alright, I will.
Later.
Bye.
Bye.
I bet it's got to be really amusing to be somebody calling into this show and just really not knowing what you're in for when you come and speak to us.
Let's go to another call.
This is like one of those times that we need a random call from, like, Travis.
Hold on, hold on.
Travis, call us!
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Fan Club, you're on the air.
Hey, Sky, Siggy here.
Hey, what's up?
Go, Siggy!
Go, Siggy!
Go!
Oh, I'll need to stop that!
We don't have to!
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that ninja rap already.
It's been over... Come here and make us!
Damn!
Oh, what a good start.
I like it when the callers berate us once in a while.
Yeah, they better be ready to receive as good as they give.
Alright, Siggy, what's on your mind?
Well, the money-wise, I finally... Who cares about the money?
I'm sorry.
I finally AAA'd the most common another, which is Commento di Adieu.
Ah, okay, good.
Yeah, and I've beaten some anothers as well, like Stoic and Murmurtwins.
Now, Stoic is some scary shit on another.
You're telling me.
Well, good for you.
So now your 2DX penis has just grown by about three centimeters.
So congratulations.
Go hump something.
Thank you.
And non-Bimani-wise, I'm planning to enter this Friday's World Series of Poker No Limit Hold'em Tournament.
Really?
Yeah.
Well, you live in Vegas, right?
Yeah.
So that's going to be very interesting being there.
They got a prize or something?
I think the top price is $350,000.
Shit!
That's just only for the minor No Limit Hold'em tournament, but the main event is going to be about $5 million.
Wow.
$5 million for poker?
I'm in the wrong job.
I can play poker.
Not that good.
I can play strip poker.
I play strip poker for free.
Well, strip poker is based on five-card... Draw?
Yeah, five-card draw.
And the tournament's Texas Hold'em?
Or what is it?
Texas Hold'em, no limit.
Yeah, see, Texas Hold'em's like the big game right now because of all the TV shows.
No one likes playing strip poker with me because I win.
All the time.
I, you know, beat them in poker and they're naked.
Fucking women, you know, they don't want to play strip poker correctly.
I mean, they just like... I agree.
Fucking women.
I was just waiting for that.
Well they freaking take off their clothes and they put a towel on.
You can't do that.
That's not the point of the game.
Oh damn, speaking of strip poker, it's been over a decade since I've played strip poker on a computer.
Oh my gosh, remember the old strip poker games on Apple II?
Oh and Illusion, screw you!
What did he say now?
Yeah, tune in to see me lose on Series of Poker?
Well, screw you!
Well, you win that money, just to show him.
And then you buy him something ugly.
Like Britney Spears.
Now, if you are able to buy this, or I'm sorry, if you're able to win this tournament, you will buy us a studio, right?
I don't know.
I haven't thought about it.
Well, first thing in mind is I might move to a new house.
Well, I suppose that's got to be done too.
I'm thinking I need to become friends with Michael Jackson.
Ah, no way.
You're not old, or you're too old.
Why?
I can understand him.
I'm not even going to go there.
Alright, anything else on your mind, Siggy?
Well, nothing much else, but yeah, I really wanted... Hey, the song I gave you earlier, you should play that.
I'll think about it.
I'll think about it.
That's a good point.
Play my song.
Oh yeah, I gotta play Loki's song.
I don't know if I'm gonna have time, because I promised Loki I'd play it.
Oh yeah, if you have some room, play Virocana.
We'll see if we can squeeze it in somewhere.
Yeah.
Alright.
Alright, we're gonna let you go now.
Alright.
Alright, later.
Later.
Alright, let's see if we have time for one more call.
In the meantime, this clip here is supposed to have, I think, a clip of Genie in a Bottle in it?
I don't know.
Somebody had posted this over on The Freak, so now I'm all curious.
Because I think this has a clip of the Genie in a Bottle mix that's on DDR Extreme.
And if not, it'll be movie time, and a good chance for us to make fun of some... E3 Cam!
It's the Fan Cam!
Fan Cam!
Oh, it's...
I'm sorry, Jamie, I'm trying.
Why does he have a helmet on?
Oh, that's right, that's that guy I saw.
Oh, you can hear the genie in a bottle thing.
Uh-oh.
Oh, shit, I broke it.
Okay.
Uh, no, yeah, let's skip it.
The tutorial's being skipped, and then they get, okay, here's the genie in a bottle, if you want to hear what this sounds like.
Alright, guys.
Joel the fan cam does DDR.
I can't hear this for shit.
No, I'm turning this off because you can't hear it for crap.
If you want to check this out, though, it's on E3insider.com.
Just do a search for DDR.
And if you turn up your speakers really, really loud, you can hear it.
And you can hear what the new Genie in a Bottle and DDR sounds like.
And supposedly, it's actually surprisingly good.
Honestly, folks, if you want to know what Genie in a Bottle sounds like, just imagine a Dance Mania cover.
That's what it is, basically.
Pretty much.
All right.
We're going to get into the FUs of the week very shortly here.
I don't see anybody else calling in.
So we will do Loki's song and then we're going to do the FUs of the week.
So start sending in the FUs of the week right now and we'll get to that.
But Loki, what are we playing here from you?
Well, this is right here, like I said before.
It's not really a remix.
It's just kind of, I extended the song a bit, and I added some samples on top of it.
I thought about remixing it, but then I figured out that the song, the portions I have of the song, because it's only a minute long, really, the original, I didn't have enough to work with to make something.
So, this is whatever crap it is.
And I don't know what the actual title of the song is, so I called it Acid.
It's
Basically, the theme that they had playing in the trailer for Metal Gear Acid 2, and it was fucking awesome.
Every time I heard the song at the Kanai booth, I'm like, I gotta get this song.
I gotta get this song.
I gotta get this song.
So, I found it.
I sort of extended it.
It's pretty cool.
Enjoy.
Metal Gear
Metal Gear
That was wonderful.
We're back on Orange Launch Radio, by the way.
Loki.
So anything else you want to say about that mix?
No, not really.
It's just awesome.
I just needed to make a version of it that could play in my car.
That's about it.
Who knows?
I might work on that later, maybe to add something.
I am, however, going to work on something because there's another song that I liked in another trailer, and I found the trailer today for Coated Arms that's going to be a remix of Trip Machine eventually.
But this is just something for now.
It's just fun.
This is because I like that song.
Well, yep, I picked different music again this week because I just cannot decide.
Big SU goes to bloating.
I'm not going to say anything more about that.
An SU goes to my car being completely undriveable now.
My fiancé, bless him, tried to hammer the fender back into place.
Well, I can drive it if I want to go left all the time.
Yeah, it's undriveable.
Unsafe.
Sigh.
Um, also, um, you know, she was a nice lady, has always done a great job doing my haircut, but my hair got cut way too short, and then I, you know, my scalp is still red from dyeing it, so, big F you to that, too.
Um...
F you to my nerves and F you to me putting off stuff that needs to get done.
And that's really... Oh yeah, and a big ol' F you to my work for changing all of my damn job duties.
Whoa, it's an E3!
Yeah, big fuck off to that.
Okay, I'm done.
Loki.
First off, fuck you to everybody that's not on Final Fantasy XI because, you know, it's very quiet when I come online to play, you know, late at night and there's just me.
I can't really talk to myself.
It's not fun.
And everyone else is Japanese and that doesn't work.
So that sucks.
You'll get over it.
Or you'll quit too.
I'm not quitting.
I have dedicated too much time to my character.
I will stay on until that game stops working.
or I become level 75 in every single job and have finished every single bit of that game.
And then I'll sell my character.
And make some mad cash.
Anyways, um, then, uh, also, just, basically, you know, fuck you to Robot Chicken for sucking the last few weeks, and fuck you to the fact that I missed Family Guy tonight.
Oh, it's not on?
Oh, well.
Never mind, then.
Family Guy is not on tonight, so listen to Orange on Radio.
Anyway.
And if you heard that, you already are listening to Orntown Radio.
And also, um, fuck you to Arnold Schwarzenegger, because he can act.
And, um, he can't really govern either, so I don't really know what his talent is yet.
He can lift weights!
He should be a weightlifter.
The end.
Um, and also, um, fuck you to everyone that's seen this new commercial with, um, Paris Hilton is too scantily clad.
Honestly...
Whatever, it's just blatant, you know, sex sells, you know, burger commercial.
I don't see anything wrong with that, to be honest.
Hell, if she's gonna be a whore, let her be a whore on TV.
At least she's, you know, scantily clad and stuff and showing off her body.
Big deal, you know, honestly, because that's her only talent.
So, just let her, you know, let her work her talent.
You know, eventually she's gonna do mainstream porn and that'll be, uh, happy.
And, um, finally, um, I'd like to mention, um, a fuck you to, uh, Patrick Swayze for being just all weird.
Because he's coming to our work next week and signing autographs, so I'm actually gonna get an autograph of his for some reason.
And, um, but he doesn't want anyone to, he doesn't want to sign anything that has to do with older projects he's worked on, i.e., like, you know, um,
Dirty Dancin' or something like that, and he doesn't want you to touch him in any way.
Aw, so you can't give Patrick Swayze a hug?
Or shake his hand or anything?
He's like, AH!
You know, just like, but anyways.
Yeah, Patrick Swayze's coming to my work.
That's awesome.
But, you know, I just don't really care either.
I'm hoping, the best person that came to our work, actually the two best people, Pauly Shore and, um, oh god, Rob Schneider.
My favorites.
Alright, I'm done.
I don't really have anything.
and F you to me feeling selfish because I'm not getting what I want and that makes me very sad.
And just F you to general blahness that I've kind of been dealing with the past few days.
And F you to feeling an utter lack of something.
And not being sure there's a lot that you can do about it.
But yeah, I guess that's it.
Was that cryptic enough?
I don't know.
Alright, let's move on.
Bradley.
Fuck you to my computer being old and my power supply burning out and causing all this computer drama.
Hopefully I can sort of push money around somewhere to, or at least to build a skeleton computer or something new.
I'm hopefully going to do that soon.
That's about all.
Alright, let's go on to the chatroom FUs.
Dynamite Rage!
Chimera wants to give an FU to GOTS.
Just remember, if you make fun of GOTS, you still play DDR.
I would be Chimera.
Close Chimera.
Close Chimera.
The CH is a hard K sound.
Whatever.
Laser123454321 says, FU to Copyright Enforcement.
Yeah, that sucks when you want to steal someone else's work.
And FU to New Orleans.
Yeah, fuck it, MPAA is shutting down some foreign sites.
Bitches.
Especially the TV ones, like, you get new shows.
MPQ says, F you to myself for forgetting last week that forum drama is retarded.
Aw, I want more details on that one.
Dark Knight says, F you to working this weekend, including Monday and missing out on the cookouts.
Ninst says, F you to half the people I went to Anime North with as they forgot about Mimos of Saturday.
F you to the MyBank, I think that meant say, Ninst says F you to MyBank, as I was unable to draw money for my account this weekend from ATMs and I can't find out why till Tuesday.
DarkTetsuya says, F you to Trip Machine, Survivor, Light.
I can't seem to get it triple A'd.
OMG It's Doobz says F you to finals for being so damn hard to study for F you to DDR players that live in Ohio for being so friggin good and last F you to you Sky for being sarcastic on my Skype call don't hate on me and my four centimeter penis I think he meant plus four centimeter penis but isn't it funnier when I say four centimeter penis
You know, that's funny, it's like, you know, like Final Fantasy, penis plus one, you know, penis plus four centimeters.
Oh, and F you to Florida, because I have to move this summer, and I don't know anyone who plays DDR at North.
BlackDevilerX says F you to my mic system for being jacked up.
I keep hearing myself echo.
F you to finals in two weeks.
F you to DarkSakura for taking my god-given voice away.
No, just kidding.
I was being mean.
F you to missing the first 15 minutes of the show.
F you in general that I haven't been able to listen to the show in so long.
and Illusion says, F you to having to fix all the bugs and not knowing how to have an exit function in my new game, Oblivion.
F you to having to censor Dammit Janet at karaoke last night saying, Janet, Janet, I love you, instead of the real lyric, Dammit Janet, I love you.
They should have censored it to fucking Janet.
Fuck off, bitch!
Oh well, we still get to do Rock Your Picture Show music, and that's the last one.
That's good.
Alright, yeah, I agree that what you should do, Illusion, is your very last night at karaoke at that place.
First off, stop going to a family-friendly establishment for karaoke, but I understand you're probably not old enough to get into a bar yet, so you can keep doing that for now, but then when you're old enough to get to a bar, do your last hurrah at karaoke, and when you've got the mic in your hand, on the very last Dammit Janet, go, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then just walk out before they throw you out.
Run.
What are they going to do?
Turn the mics off on you?
Oh, no.
Ow, my freaking ears.
My ears are bleeding.
I heard naughty words, and I'm going to go to hell for it.
I want to have sex with prostitutes now, Mommy.
Because I saw it on TV.
That's the nice thing about karaoke, where I go to karaoke, is that you can replace the lyrics with, fuck off, bitch, I wanna screw, and then they laugh.
I was remembering the touch-a-touch-a line, that was funny.
Oh, fuck-a-fuck-a-fuck me?
No, you went up there and... Oh, yeah, who was singing it, Jessica?
Jessica was.
Yeah, Jessica, a guana girl was up on stage singing touch-a-touch-a-touch me, so I walked up on stage and grabbed her boobs.
That cracks me up.
Anyways, oh yeah.
Did we mention that we sometimes use foul language on this show?
This is your program because I need language.
We gave the disclaimer.
If people are offended by it, you heard the disclaimer.
Fuck off.
Yeah.
Alright.
We're going to do another quickie break here.
I love internet radio!
Just an uber quick break here, and then we're going to come back with Ask Orange Lounge.
So you guys have a few minutes to get in your questions for Ask Orange Lounge.
You can ask us anything you want, within reason.
And send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your question.
It's your chance to direct the show the way you want.
We'll be back after this, featuring some music from DDR Solo.
Because I kind of want to strut my funky stuff right about now.
So we'll be back after this.
Come on, come on!
Thanks for watching!
Love and Peace is our fight.
I will follow only you
And now, let's listen in to an Orange Lounge Radio staff meeting as they debate some of the new programming coming to Orange Lounge Radio.
Jamie, I have a suggestion about some of the music in our Bomani Music and More program.
Can we talk about that?
No subject will ever be taboo.
Well, I was thinking maybe we should move Pump Up the Volume from Tuesday Nights.
Except, of course, a subject that was just under discussion.
Okay, well, what would you think if maybe we cut back on some of the tack music we play on the station?
I collect your fucking head.
Just like this fucker here.
Oh my god, why did you do that to Loki?
The holic thing on episode 69 was just a joke!
Now if any of you sons of bitches got anything else to say, now's the fucking time!
Orange Lounge Radio, where everybody has a say.
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio.
Loki's saying nobody gets the Episode 69 thing anymore.
You're probably right.
I wasn't even here for Episode 69.
Which, in a way, kind of makes it funnier when you consider all the holic thing, you know?
But, anyway.
We actually have quite a few questions tonight for Ask Orange Lounge.
Usually I'm having to beg and plead for questions, but people just want to know shit tonight, so this is good.
Let's get to it. ...
Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid question.
What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?
We've got a lot of questions and only 10 minutes left of show, so we better hurry through.
These questions are somewhere getting left in the dust.
Illusion.
Question for Loki, you often do remixes of Babani songs, but do you do any original songs?
And if you do, would you ever release a CD?
Um, I do original songs, but it's been a looong time.
We've played some of them on the station before.
It was a long time ago when you did original stuff.
Why'd you stop?
It's just, I was using old programs like EJ and stuff, and I- Lazy.
No, not lazy, it's just the sound samples I didn't really want to work with, and I tried to upgrade programs and stuff to something that would be more fun to work with.
I don't know, I- I don't know.
We'll see.
Maybe.
Well, now, you did put together a compilation CD, but you only did like two or three copies of the CD, right?
Well, yeah, because I have all the files.
Originally, it was going to be one of those create-your-own-CD-type situations on like a website.
Of course, web hosting, you know, it's not too reliable, so, yeah.
Yeah, I hate that.
I just can't find any websites with unlimited bandwidth or anything.
Alright, let's move on.
Jin4576 says, Namco Cross Capcom came out in Japan recently.
Do you think that it will come out here in the US?
Of course.
My answer is yes.
Yes, it definitely will come out here.
In fact, I think it's already been announced.
They just didn't show it at E3 for whatever reason.
So, I expect you'll probably see it, what, Christmas time?
What do you think?
Probably.
Does that sound good?
Yeah, I like that idea.
It'll come out here.
I think that's too big a game to not come out here.
Laser123454321 wants to know, what would be a good licensed song for Beatmania USA?
Well, like I said before, name of the game.
That'd be good.
There's a lot of stuff that would lend itself pretty well to... You can even do, like, if you want to really get obscure, you can do the Beck remixes with the 8-bit remixes for his stuff.
Oh, the Ghetto Chip Malfunction and stuff like that?
You can get some of that in there.
Thanks for watching!
Exactly!
Oh my god, MIDI head stuff.
I mean, that's, I think, where they should go.
And ToeJam.
I bet ToeJam's gonna be in there.
Just because it's, you know, a different drum song, and it was in, you know, the 2DX... Technically, Big Idea is in a different drum.
But I know what you're saying.
It was a US song, and now it's in Happy Sky.
Yeah.
Yeah, who knows.
That'd be neat.
I, personally, I really want Echo Image Skulk.
Or at least some Echo Image song.
That'd be cool.
Kymera, since I got criticized for my pronunciation, wants to know, Yo, do you think it would be ethical to cheat friends of their souls, like in a game of high stakes poker?
Absolutely not.
If they're stupid enough to bet it, then they're stupid enough to lose it.
Like if you're going to sell your soul for a donut, I mean... Or sell your soul for $5.
Or sell it on eBay.
That would be a fucking good donut.
Also, shouldn't Maddox get his own forums?
I hate Cameron Diaz I hate Cameron Diaz too
It's because of that stupid MTV show that she does now.
An MTV show?
Yeah.
She goes to all the parts of the world that are poor.
Like, you know, Africa and the Amazon and blah blah blah.
Look, he doesn't need forums because people talk about him on other forums.
Look, we're talking about him now.
This is free publicity he didn't pay for.
He doesn't need forums.
It would just be annoying, trust me.
He wouldn't do it.
I wouldn't want him.
Yeah, I wouldn't do it.
Chubs wants to know, what is the circumference of your left wrist?
Well, that's a good question.
I don't have one of those bendy rulers, though, like a fabric ruler that you would use to measure fabric that can bend around.
I don't have one of those, so I can't really measure it.
I know this is radio, but it's about that big.
Well, let's see here.
Okay, now everyone knows that if you point your finger like a gun, that is how big your penis is, supposedly, okay?
What?
What?
What?
Supposedly.
I don't have to worry about that.
Hold on, I'm looking at something here.
Oh, never mind.
So I would say roughly the circumference... Hold on, I need to go in the bathroom for a minute.
I would say mine's about 7 inches around.
Yeah, I'd say about that too.
My wrist.
Let's see.
Who cares?
My thumb is just touching my index finger.
You're supposed to use your index finger between your knuckles.
I'd say 12 inches.
Forget it.
12 inches.
Can you lick your elbow?
Forget it.
Dark Knight wants to know, oh Sky, I finally got an MP3 player that can handle multiple episodes of Orange Lounge Radio to go now.
So the only thing I worry about now is losing it because it's a small house MP3 player.
Put it on a string and wear it around your neck.
That's the only way I don't lose things is to wear it around my neck.
That's what I have to do with my work badge.
If I did not wear my work badge around my damn neck, I would lose it.
I don't care if I look stupid wearing my work badge around my neck or I look like a girl or something.
I've never lost the damn thing and I've never had to pay the $10 replacement fee.
So there you have it.
If you don't want to lose it, wear it around your neck.
Agree?
Disagree?
No comment?
Put a giant freaking chain on it.
Duct tape!
Duct tape it to your forehead.
You will never lose it again.
Also, when you pull the duct tape off, you'll have big red welts.
Go welts.
Whoops, that actually wasn't supposed to be a question on air.
That was a question to me.
That was a private question to me.
For those of you that like to have private conversations with a host during the show, that's fine and good, but just keep in mind if we're in the middle of a segment where I'm soliciting private messages, you might get caught in the middle.
Just a warning.
It's a good thing he didn't send something that says like, oh man, I just cheated on somebody or I don't know, whatever it is.
I go and read that all the time.
Oh my god, I secretly read Britney Spears.
Hey, remember that one time that Ryan's girlfriend called in for Ryan and Ryan wasn't here and she, you know.
Oh, I just shot myself in the foot.
Yeah.
OMGitsDoobz wants to know, why do all goths think they are vampires?
That is bullshit, okay?
That is bullshit.
Some of them think they're succubuses.
Succubi, thank you.
Succubi, whatever.
I have never once thought I was a vampire.
Or a succubus.
Some of them think they're...
Free!
Okay, you need to drop that, because that is old joke, okay?
Why is it so funny?
I don't know.
Oh, because she's a fat cow, that's why.
Of course, for those that don't remember, this is dating back to the old LiveJournal community on LiveJournal.
This is just more of a case of people making fun of what they don't understand.
She could become a fat cow like that.
No, the stupid bitch deserved it because she really was an idiot.
But I'm referring to this whole, oh, let's make fun of everybody who's goth or whatever.
You know what?
Don't poke fun at what you don't understand because it just makes you look like a big weirdo.
Why do all DDR players think they're Asian?
I can ask the same thing.
See?
And they don't.
Exactly.
Unless they happen to... Hey, honestly, I'm defending the goths here, okay?
SuicideGirls.com is fucking hot, okay?
Those goth chicks... Shut up, shut up, shut up.
Oh, now he has more questions here.
Oh, and why is Paris Hilton so famous for making a porn video?
I wish I could get a girl famous for having sex with me, just so I can say, do me, there's a future in it.
Oh, yeah.
Do me, there's a future in it.
Do me now!
I don't know.
Honestly, she's famous probably because she's rich.
Because their parents are rich.
She's famous because she blew her way to the top, literally.
DarkTetsuya wants to know, if Konami were to make a new challenge remix, what song would you like to see?
Cowgirl Survivor.
No, shut up.
Shut up right now.
A new challenge remix.
Oh, like Oni.
Yeah, remember back in Max 2 when they were trying to keep the series fresh, you know?
Well, then I fucking want Butterfly Oni.
No, I guess we already have that.
You can't do that.
It's a licensed song.
Ah, shut up.
Can we do Ultramix 2 stuff?
I suppose.
How about Gyrus?
I guess you could do that.
That's what I want.
I want Gyrus.
No, what they should honestly do is like, you know, I don't know.
I thought the whole idea with doing those Oni remixes was a cool idea.
I mean, it kept the series fresh.
It was like, ooh, that's kind of neat, you know, because they remixed all these songs.
And then they just said, you know what?
We just don't care anymore.
Let's give them another erotic song and put some eye toy support in there.
It won't know different.
I'll shut them up.
We'll change the color of the interface and then we'll tell them that we're starting over and we'll stop.
I think it's time to put the nail in the coffin of this lovely program known as Orange Lounge Radio and this mediocre show we had tonight.
I hope you found it to be as okay as I did.
Download our podcast, which is sure to be ten times better.
No, I'm kidding.
I kid.
Our show's awesome.
We're the best thing ever.
And so, you know, congratulations.
You're a part of it.
Final thoughts, Bradley, the loud mouth who can't shut up during our show so we can do a show here.
Bradley, your final thought.
Yeah, goodbye and good fish and all of that.
And my final thought is, I hate myself and I want to die.
And I gotta go get that shirt out of the dryer so I can wear it tonight.
And I have to go back to my castle.
DarkSakura.
I hate my life.
Every day I polish my revolver and I shoot my head like a rock star.
Alright, the final word of the show, I'm taking it tonight, because I don't get the final show often enough.
