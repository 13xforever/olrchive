Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition week of May 23rd, 2005.

00:30.000 --> 00:34.600
Welcome to our podcast the orange launch radio to go edition where we talk about games that don't suck

00:34.600 --> 00:36.600
My name is Rob Roberts. You might know me as sky

00:37.040 --> 00:42.720
Joining me as my co-host Loki. Hello and the other co-host dark Sakura

00:42.720 --> 00:47.720
She is not here tonight because she is coming back from LA the day that we're taping this podcast

00:47.720 --> 00:50.920
She stayed a couple days extra so she could go to Disneyland and stuff. Yeah

00:50.920 --> 00:57.280
Yeah, we actually went a couple days early so we could go check out the more friends concert which happened on Monday night

00:57.280 --> 00:59.120
What did you think of the More Friends concert, Loki?

00:59.120 --> 01:03.640
It was good, but it was littered with technical issues.

01:03.640 --> 01:04.880
Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing.

01:04.880 --> 01:06.600
A lot of sound problems, and I think

01:06.600 --> 01:09.500
whoever was behind arranging the sound and stuff for that show

01:09.500 --> 01:10.880
is going to get canned.

01:10.880 --> 01:13.680
And the real too bad part is that it probably

01:13.680 --> 01:15.160
jeopardizes whether that is going

01:15.160 --> 01:16.840
to happen in the future or not.

01:16.840 --> 01:17.960
You know, it's kind of sad.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.000
I almost feel like because the audience reception was

01:21.000 --> 01:23.720
kind of lukewarm to it, and it's too bad

01:23.720 --> 01:26.120
because they did some amazing things at the concert.

01:26.120 --> 01:32.320
The opera scene that they did was great, and the Black Mages rocked, and that combination

01:32.320 --> 01:36.280
at the very end, they played one wing angel combined, the Black Mages and the orchestra

01:36.280 --> 01:37.280
and the choir.

01:37.280 --> 01:38.280
It was amazing.

01:38.280 --> 01:39.280
Exactly.

01:39.280 --> 01:41.920
It's just kind of too bad that because of the sound issues, when I say sound issue,

01:41.920 --> 01:48.720
I mean like during like Eris's theme and stuff, when you hear that doo doo doo doo doo doo,

01:48.720 --> 01:50.960
you hear like these big popping noises and things like that.

01:50.960 --> 01:52.440
Yeah, the sound of stuff exploding.

01:52.440 --> 01:56.120
Oh yeah, the emcee's mic didn't work for some of it and a bunch of other stuff.

01:56.120 --> 01:57.120
It's just too bad.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.560
It was really sad.

01:58.560 --> 02:03.500
But I mean, overall, it's nobody, no talent person's fault.

02:03.500 --> 02:10.040
The orchestra was great, the singers were great, Uematsu and his band were awesome.

02:10.040 --> 02:11.040
Overall it was a good time.

02:11.040 --> 02:16.280
It's just too bad that some bad sound department can really screw up a show like that and kind

02:16.280 --> 02:20.040
of make the whole thing look bad.

02:20.040 --> 02:23.360
Speaking of sound issues, you may notice we're back to our studio sound.

02:23.360 --> 02:25.240
That's because, of course, we are back in the studio.

02:25.240 --> 02:28.080
I actually had a chance to listen to the podcast we recorded, and

02:28.080 --> 02:32.240
I noticed that the sound quality was a lot lower than what you're used to.

02:32.240 --> 02:37.440
Do remember, you guys, we were on cheap little $10 microphones and a laptop.

02:37.440 --> 02:41.480
And now we're back to having our mixing board and our nicer microphones.

02:41.480 --> 02:45.080
So we hope you guys enjoyed our podcast from E3 nonetheless.

02:45.080 --> 02:48.360
We wanna do it again next year, hopefully do some interviews and

02:48.360 --> 02:52.500
things like that as well just as this podcast continues to grow and if you

02:52.500 --> 02:56.940
haven't checked it out yet subscribe to our podcast and catch up on your iPod or

02:56.940 --> 02:59.820
Doppler or whatever program you use catch up on the feeds and check it out

02:59.820 --> 03:03.620
or you can look at our portal on like podcast alley or podcast pickle any of

03:03.620 --> 03:08.940
those sites ought to have a record of all the shows we have currently on file

03:08.940 --> 03:12.940
it's pretty cool all right let's talk about our gaming week well obviously we

03:12.940 --> 03:17.660
were at e3 most of the week but out of curiosity was there any games that you

03:17.660 --> 03:22.620
played that wasn't an E3, something else maybe you played, Loki.

03:22.620 --> 03:24.940
I played a lot of

03:24.940 --> 03:29.140
Rengoku Tower of Purgatory, and actually the game kind of grew on me just because I figured

03:29.140 --> 03:30.320
out a way

03:30.320 --> 03:36.620
eh, it's kind of good and bad for the game. This is a PSP game, right? PSP game, it's

03:36.620 --> 03:37.700
a Konami game.

03:37.700 --> 03:41.980
It's kind of very similar to say, oh I want to say like

03:41.980 --> 03:44.100
Diablo but not.

03:44.100 --> 03:50.260
It kind of reminded me of Diablo, but basically what it is is you're this sort of Android

03:50.260 --> 03:55.300
thing and you can attach different parts as you're defeating these other androids.

03:55.300 --> 04:01.420
You can attach their parts to you and you can get like, for example, say you have this

04:01.420 --> 04:03.140
one weapon which is a double cloth.

04:03.140 --> 04:06.660
You attach it to your arm, it's actually like a cloth, you attach it to your head, it's

04:06.660 --> 04:09.040
almost like horns or something.

04:09.040 --> 04:14.600
And so I've been going through this game and just kind of basically like leveling up on

04:14.600 --> 04:15.600
each floor.

04:15.600 --> 04:22.360
But the problem is I figured out a way to level up so fast that I'm unstoppable now.

04:22.360 --> 04:25.800
It's kind of a flaw in the game but it makes it fun at the same time.

04:25.800 --> 04:30.120
I don't really know how to describe it but right now I'm really powerful and I figured

04:30.120 --> 04:36.640
out a way to kill everything like super quick and I guess I don't know but I don't really

04:36.640 --> 04:37.640
play much of the game.

04:37.640 --> 04:45.640
There's not really much depth to it. It's just kind of you go level to level and you rise up this tower and I don't really know what the plotline is.

04:45.640 --> 04:52.640
But it's kind of fun attaching all these different weapons to you and you have to think a little bit. It's kind of like armored core in a sense I guess.

04:52.640 --> 04:58.640
But I was playing a lot of that in More Ridge Racer for the PSP, and I was kind of trying

04:58.640 --> 05:04.040
out some of the newer, I'm on the EX tracks now, and once I pass those I have to get to

05:04.040 --> 05:10.280
the pro track, or the, was it max tracks, the max circuits, and those are apparently

05:10.280 --> 05:13.000
impossible to play.

05:13.000 --> 05:14.660
Alright.

05:14.660 --> 05:18.720
I guess my week, pretty much I didn't play a whole lot of stuff outside of E3, but I'll

05:18.720 --> 05:19.720
tell you one thing.

05:19.720 --> 05:23.940
I took a little piece of E3 home with me one night because I actually used the DS download

05:23.940 --> 05:30.460
station to take Meteos back to the hotel and Lankystyle and myself, you might know him

05:30.460 --> 05:34.700
from some of the programs on Orange Launch Radio's live station.

05:34.700 --> 05:39.040
We actually played Meteos Versus because we both downloaded it from the DS download station.

05:39.040 --> 05:41.700
We played Versus in the hotel room later on that night.

05:41.700 --> 05:44.860
So much fun, it's a great game.

05:44.860 --> 05:50.000
I remember back on the podcast I kind of was annoyed with the DS download station the first

05:50.000 --> 05:53.640
day because it was hard to get in there and get anything because it was always crowded,

05:53.640 --> 05:56.720
but you know once you got in there and got something it was a pretty neat concept and

05:56.720 --> 06:01.160
being able to put your DS to sleep, I wish I had still slept the damn thing and I could

06:01.160 --> 06:04.480
still have that Meteos demo, but I'll just have to wait until next week when the game

06:04.480 --> 06:05.480
comes out.

06:05.480 --> 06:11.480
It's a great puzzler, I'm so happy the DS, honestly the E3 really did restore my faith

06:11.480 --> 06:15.000
of the DS I'm so happy because really right now there's not a lot of great

06:15.000 --> 06:18.440
stuff out for it but there's so much good stuff on the horizon I'm very happy

06:18.440 --> 06:23.320
and ten dogs needs to be pushed up to say I don't know next week seriously but

06:23.320 --> 06:26.840
last date we hear for Nintendo as I think was August 22nd so I'm like

06:26.840 --> 06:31.520
anything speaking of e3 let's get into some game news and talk about e3 kind of

06:31.520 --> 06:35.680
the winding down of e3 and everything going on Loki how many people would you

06:35.680 --> 06:39.540
say attended e3 this year and your perception of walking around the show

06:39.540 --> 06:42.820
Way too many.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.620
If you could make a guess.

06:45.620 --> 06:46.620
I would say million bajillion.

06:46.620 --> 06:47.620
No, I don't know.

06:47.620 --> 06:54.180
I'd say probably about maybe 100,000.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.180
I don't know.

06:55.180 --> 06:59.220
A little high, but 70,000 people attended this year's E3 Expo.

06:59.220 --> 07:04.700
To put this into perspective a little bit for you guys, last year's E3 Expo was 58,000.

07:04.700 --> 07:09.220
So that was 12,000 more people at E3 this year compared to last year.

07:09.220 --> 07:14.220
The Los Angeles Convention Center is 547,000 square feet.

07:14.940 --> 07:16.980
So if you think about putting 70,000 people in that,

07:16.980 --> 07:18.900
now granted, they aren't always all there at once,

07:18.900 --> 07:22.340
but still, putting a good number of that in that center,

07:22.340 --> 07:24.020
you can kinda see where things get really,

07:24.020 --> 07:25.740
really crowded at E3.

07:25.740 --> 07:30.740
400 exhibitors, 5,000 products on display for 70,000 people.

07:31.260 --> 07:32.920
Very interesting, very crowded.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.180
E3's dates for next year have been announced.

07:36.180 --> 07:37.980
It sounds like it's bumping up a little earlier

07:37.980 --> 07:41.180
in the month by a week, May 10th through the 12th of 2006.

07:41.180 --> 07:42.060
Yeah, I know.

07:42.060 --> 07:43.900
I've already gotten the bad news.

07:43.900 --> 07:45.220
Oh, you're not going to be able to make it?

07:45.220 --> 07:47.520
Well, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to make it

07:47.520 --> 07:50.260
because I'm getting married that Sunday before.

07:50.260 --> 07:52.540
Well, that would be a good reason why you can't go.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.740
Yeah, I don't think.

07:53.740 --> 07:55.300
I'm not even going to try pushing it.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.500
I mean, that's just bad news.

07:57.500 --> 08:00.660
Well, a very interesting story actually turned up on GameSpot.

08:00.660 --> 08:03.220
You may not be the only one that doesn't get to go next year.

08:03.220 --> 08:05.460
A very interesting article on GameSpot.

08:05.460 --> 08:07.140
It's kind of a little bit of an interview

08:07.140 --> 08:09.700
with the show director Mary Doelier,

08:09.700 --> 08:12.260
I'm sorry if I mispronounced that there,

08:12.260 --> 08:15.220
talking about some changes that they wanna make

08:15.220 --> 08:17.740
to the show, and a lot of the article talks about

08:17.740 --> 08:19.700
should they make the show public?

08:19.700 --> 08:23.060
And they don't really wanna make the show public,

08:23.060 --> 08:25.040
even though there have been cries to do that for a long time

08:25.040 --> 08:28.240
but trust me guys, it's crowded enough as it is.

08:28.240 --> 08:31.060
And what the director said is, quote,

08:31.060 --> 08:33.180
the biggest headache is trying to keep the consumers

08:33.180 --> 08:34.400
from coming to the show.

08:34.400 --> 08:35.900
Everyone feels that they should come

08:35.900 --> 08:39.660
And there's a number of people that will work at a retail outlet, they'll get a job there

08:39.660 --> 08:43.340
and work there for two weeks, and because they have a pay stub, they think that they're

08:43.340 --> 08:45.380
entitled to come.

08:45.380 --> 08:48.700
So it's very interesting that the director of E3, and we kind of, on our E3 podcast,

08:48.700 --> 08:49.860
we kind of bitched about that.

08:49.860 --> 08:55.820
Some of the people we saw there were from like banks and, you know, stores that have

08:55.820 --> 08:56.820
many departments.

08:56.820 --> 09:00.920
And we know for a fact there were people there that worked in like a lawn and garden department,

09:00.920 --> 09:03.600
but were coming for E3 to look at the games.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.700
So the director of the show is kind of aware of what's going on, so it'll be very interesting

09:06.700 --> 09:09.300
to see if there's any changes to next year's show.

09:09.300 --> 09:17.360
They did reject their saying 16,000 people this year, so interesting.

09:17.360 --> 09:22.040
And of course they're talking about that they will kind of reevaluate things and see what

09:22.040 --> 09:23.040
they should do.

09:23.040 --> 09:27.460
More credentials, that's all it really comes down to is just maybe instead of asking for

09:27.460 --> 09:31.600
one pay stub, maybe ask for the most recent pay stub or something like that, like one

09:31.600 --> 09:34.720
that's only a few weeks old or something.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.800
The final word here in this article from the director.

09:37.800 --> 09:42.160
As far as the improvement side, we'll continually watch the registration and try to set policies

09:42.160 --> 09:46.260
and make sure that we're really letting in only the quality people and staff up with

09:46.260 --> 09:51.220
more registration people to make sure we keep it to just the people who should be here.

09:51.220 --> 09:52.220
Very interesting.

09:52.220 --> 09:56.820
So unfortunately, if you guys are a little bummed that it's kind of hard to go to E3,

09:56.820 --> 09:58.200
it's going to get harder next year.

09:58.200 --> 10:02.140
It sucks too because now that you get in but they want like oh well we have some of the

10:02.140 --> 10:05.980
consumers coming in let's make it all media only I mean yeah so we kind of

10:05.980 --> 10:10.780
complained about earlier so interesting so we'll see what happens with e3 next

10:10.780 --> 10:13.980
year of course there won't be any word on next year's e3 outside of the date

10:13.980 --> 10:18.860
until much later on so looking around the internet there's some other stories

10:18.860 --> 10:23.580
that come up as well one thing that was interesting that wasn't at e3 this year

10:23.580 --> 10:27.740
was the phantom console now remember that they have like a huge booth last

10:27.740 --> 10:28.500
year

10:28.500 --> 10:31.740
at a huge booth showing up the phantom console must be this big thing you

10:31.740 --> 10:33.280
download games online

10:33.280 --> 10:37.060
we heard rumors they were going to be there at e3 this year but

10:37.060 --> 10:40.340
not the same with me folks vaporware

10:40.340 --> 10:42.300
vaporware

10:42.300 --> 10:47.700
i feel sorry for you exactly put money into this thing article on cnn money

10:47.700 --> 10:51.360
quote the company believes based on past performance that there is a high

10:51.360 --> 10:56.320
likelihood that sufficient capital will not be available and many or all of these milestones

10:56.320 --> 11:01.480
will be missed and the launch date will again shift and or the company will go out of business.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.960
There's no market for it anymore because all these new game consoles are coming out.

11:04.960 --> 11:06.120
It's pretty much what it is.

11:06.120 --> 11:09.600
You can download content, you can play games online with your friends.

11:09.600 --> 11:10.600
They're just too late.

11:10.600 --> 11:16.360
They did not get this console out fast enough and even if they were to try to push it out

11:16.360 --> 11:18.520
now it's going to be a failure.

11:18.520 --> 11:23.320
basically I would say take you know count your losses now and just don't or

11:23.320 --> 11:27.400
maybe try to team up your technology with one of the folks that's going into

11:27.400 --> 11:30.840
this very soon like placed I although I doubt something like that would happen

11:30.840 --> 11:36.960
I suppose you never know so there goes the phantom console not gone forever yet

11:36.960 --> 11:41.400
I'd love to take one of those because that'd make really cool case mod but you

11:41.400 --> 11:47.840
know I granted they had a really cool the console look cool I mean it's a lot

11:47.840 --> 11:52.640
better than, say, the Revolution, at least the design of it.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.720
Speaking of the Revolution, the Revolution was starting to feel like vaporware a little

11:56.720 --> 11:59.680
bit as well as E3 because we didn't see a whole lot on it.

11:59.680 --> 12:02.160
We did get to see some early console designs.

12:02.160 --> 12:07.000
They are promising that they will reveal more details about the Revolution by the end of

12:07.000 --> 12:08.600
this year, which makes sense.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.680
They're going to have to, really.

12:10.680 --> 12:16.080
One thing that did happen is that the company's Japanese site for Nintendo actually released

12:16.080 --> 12:20.200
some new images of the revolution and it actually shows the revolution in some

12:20.200 --> 12:21.120
different colors

12:21.120 --> 12:24.880
including, I'm bringing this picture up in studio right now so look you can see

12:24.880 --> 12:26.680
this, there's actually black

12:26.680 --> 12:29.960
and white and then there's like this pinkish color

12:29.960 --> 12:34.440
and this really like barfy yellow color that the revolution is supposed to be coming

12:34.440 --> 12:39.220
coming in. Very interesting. That doesn't look like a Nintendo console to me, it looks

12:39.220 --> 12:45.380
like a PS2, or it looks like a disc drive, it's so weird. It looks like a micro ITX PC case

12:45.380 --> 12:49.660
And honestly, there are micro-ITX PC cases that look exactly like this.

12:49.660 --> 12:50.660
That's the thing.

12:50.660 --> 12:51.660
It's a box.

12:51.660 --> 12:53.740
Ooh, it's a box of the glowing CD drive.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.500
Wow, you went out on a limb to make that one.

12:56.500 --> 12:59.660
Well, we can knock the system until we get more details.

12:59.660 --> 13:01.060
I'm knocking it right now.

13:01.060 --> 13:02.060
It looks ugly.

13:02.060 --> 13:04.980
It's just like you didn't spend any time.

13:04.980 --> 13:09.740
Okay, granted the PlayStation 3 isn't much better, but at least it looks sleek and it

13:09.740 --> 13:10.740
looks nice.

13:10.740 --> 13:13.400
Like it's something that you'd want to have in your house because it looks cool.

13:13.400 --> 13:18.480
The revolution looks like something I'm going to shove next to my VCR because it's small.

13:18.480 --> 13:22.360
What's interesting is that also what you can notice on the console from these screenshots

13:22.360 --> 13:28.240
is you can actually see a flip top that will reveal some GameCube style controller ports

13:28.240 --> 13:33.860
as well as GameCube memory card slots, which makes sense if this is going to be a backwards

13:33.860 --> 13:35.120
compatible system.

13:35.120 --> 13:38.620
They need to have this somewhere on the system as well.

13:38.620 --> 13:42.060
Also the system is supposed to have, of course as we already know, wireless controls and

13:42.060 --> 13:46.020
an internal flash memory so this stuff is all kind of extra but there's that

13:46.020 --> 13:51.000
flip-top there Loki if you haven't seen that vehicle yeah now see now one little

13:51.000 --> 13:54.660
cool thing yeah well that's kind of cool that it's on there still looks like a

13:54.660 --> 13:59.940
box all right so we'll hopefully see a little more on the Nintendo evolution

13:59.940 --> 14:03.480
later on but that'll be cool for case body what do you I didn't you have

14:03.480 --> 14:06.420
something on Nintendo revolution you want to share oh no it's a couple things

14:06.420 --> 14:11.200
first there was an article that came out though saying oh the revolution is going

14:11.200 --> 14:14.620
to be able to run like home brew code on it and everyone's excited, oh yay, home brew

14:14.620 --> 14:17.660
code. Then there's another article that came out and said no, you're not going to be able

14:17.660 --> 14:20.460
to run home brew code. In fact, there's going to be a new digital rights management thing

14:20.460 --> 14:24.180
in place where it'll be impossible for you to run home brew code on it and impossible

14:24.180 --> 14:29.880
of course meaning that it will take a little bit more time to run home brew code on it.

14:29.880 --> 14:33.520
It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen honestly. And you know what's funny

14:33.520 --> 14:38.380
is last night I was trying to download the full videos for, remember that Revolution

14:38.380 --> 14:42.060
thing that was out, you know, with the video and everything.

14:42.060 --> 14:44.140
It's very interesting, that whole video...

14:44.140 --> 14:45.380
The fan video you're talking about?

14:45.380 --> 14:46.380
The fan one.

14:46.380 --> 14:47.380
Okay, the fan-made video.

14:47.380 --> 14:50.880
Well, it's got that case design, though, in it.

14:50.880 --> 14:54.540
And I don't know when that video came out, I mean, but it's got that same case design

14:54.540 --> 14:56.440
with the other thing.

14:56.440 --> 15:00.940
Because we still haven't seen what the controller looks like for the revolution, so...

15:00.940 --> 15:06.760
But anyways, supposedly, you know, but I wanted to get the whole fan video because it looked

15:06.760 --> 15:10.600
kind of cool and there's like five different parts but their website was bandwidth exceeded

15:10.600 --> 15:16.840
so nope but i'll have that hopefully one of these days you know isn't it weird that every time

15:17.480 --> 15:21.000
somebody goes to e3 and this happened to me last year too it's like there's something you

15:21.000 --> 15:25.880
completely freaking missed at the show and you're like how did i miss this i walked the show floor

15:25.880 --> 15:30.200
like four times and i somehow completely missed this well i feel embarrassed that i missed this

15:30.200 --> 15:34.600
one but you know what there's so much stuff that goes on at e3 that sometimes you know you just

15:34.600 --> 15:38.560
missed the most obvious things. There's actually a brand new Mario Brothers game

15:38.560 --> 15:43.080
coming to the DS and I don't mean some Mario franchise, you know, Mario baseball,

15:43.080 --> 15:48.160
Mario DDR, whatever. I'm talking a Mario Brothers side-scroll game is coming out

15:48.160 --> 15:51.640
for the DS. I saw that. What did you think of this? I didn't hear you bring

15:51.640 --> 15:58.120
this up on the podcast. It looked dumb. Really? How did it look dumb? Because it's Mario... The screenshots I saw

15:58.120 --> 16:04.860
look pretty sweet it just it reminded me of like like paper Mario I don't like

16:04.860 --> 16:11.280
paper Mario I've always been bitter with paper Mario because it's not Mario RPG

16:11.280 --> 16:16.080
and they want to say it's Mario RPG 2 and it's no but anyways um no it's just

16:16.080 --> 16:20.880
I if they're gonna do a new Mario game it's got to be old-school like graphics

16:20.880 --> 16:26.000
2d but that's kind of what they're going for is what it looked like I'll see the

16:26.000 --> 16:32.240
The other cool thing I thought is if you remember Super Smash Brothers Melee, there's like that

16:32.240 --> 16:35.760
stage where you actually kind of play like Mario when you're going through like the adventure

16:35.760 --> 16:37.100
mode or something like that.

16:37.100 --> 16:38.100
That was cool.

16:38.100 --> 16:39.100
That was so cool.

16:39.100 --> 16:45.640
Like they should make an entire like GameCube Mario in that regard, but we'll see.

16:45.640 --> 16:47.420
I guess maybe we're just wishing.

16:47.420 --> 16:49.400
Well, whatever.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.840
One big surprise at the show about the Xbox 360, Square Enix is hopping on board because

16:53.840 --> 16:59.220
Final Fantasy XI will be released for the Xbox 360. Rumor was that it was going to have

16:59.220 --> 17:04.420
graphic upgrades, but apparently those rumors are actually being shot down. They will not

17:04.420 --> 17:09.260
have graphic upgrades in it. It's going to be the same thing. But here's the deal. I

17:09.260 --> 17:14.120
think this is really what it is, if you think about it. If you play on the PS2, you're playing

17:14.120 --> 17:20.260
in like 640x480 low res mode, but it looks fine on a TV. But if you play that same mode

17:20.260 --> 17:24.460
on a computer, it looks a little choppy, but it looks fine on TV. I imagine what they're

17:24.460 --> 17:29.640
doing with the Xbox is it's just like playing it on a high-end PC. And when you port that

17:29.640 --> 17:34.340
to a television set, it looks really, really clean. So I imagine that's just what it is.

17:34.340 --> 17:35.340
It's just a high-end computer.

17:35.340 --> 17:39.740
It's all it is, and it's going to be because it's HDTV compatible, so it's going to be

17:39.740 --> 17:46.660
high-end graphics, but it's not going to exceed that of the actual PC version. It's just some

17:46.660 --> 17:47.660
different things.

17:47.660 --> 17:51.860
Other questions were answered at a press conference at Square Enix held after the show in regards

17:51.860 --> 17:55.340
to Final Fantasy XI, among with some other Square Enix games.

17:55.340 --> 18:01.060
Final Fantasy XI will use the same servers on the Xbox 360 as the PC or PS2.

18:01.060 --> 18:04.700
Rumors are going around to the contrary, but they put those to rest.

18:04.700 --> 18:07.500
So you will play on the same servers that everyone else plays on.

18:07.500 --> 18:13.220
So it'll be, I think, the first game to be a cross-server across three different platforms,

18:13.220 --> 18:14.220
I think.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.220
Maybe.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.220
Maybe.

18:16.220 --> 18:21.140
Was Fantasy Star Online? But they don't all share the same servers, that's the problem.

18:21.140 --> 18:25.900
Yeah, weird, huh? Final Fantasy XII was not playable at E3.

18:25.900 --> 18:29.980
They claim it was an issue of timing, but they are saying that they will have it

18:29.980 --> 18:31.740
playable at the end of July

18:31.740 --> 18:37.400
in some type of private setting. So I think our rumors that we completely made

18:37.400 --> 18:40.940
up about the fact that it's being pushed for PlayStation 3 are false. It will come

18:40.940 --> 18:41.980
out on PS2.

18:41.980 --> 18:48.460
But I'll tell you what it looks damn good. I mean honestly the movie we saw inside the

18:49.060 --> 18:51.060
Square Enix theater

18:51.220 --> 18:55.500
When you see this thing you you would have a hard time believing its ps2 as well. It looks very good

18:57.740 --> 19:03.420
Square Enix will be dubbing Final Fantasy 7 advent children in English when they release it here in America

19:04.460 --> 19:10.300
No word yet, if they will do it in Japanese with English subtitles as well like another option on the DVD

19:10.300 --> 19:16.740
I'm sure well well the best it well the best answer. They got was a we will consider the possibility. I didn't get a yes

19:17.860 --> 19:19.860
hmm

19:20.180 --> 19:26.380
World of Mana was a game that was teased at e3, but really no additional information outside of that

19:26.380 --> 19:30.900
I remember seeing a trailer for it, but it really didn't show anything just that ooh a new amount of games

19:30.900 --> 19:34.060
It's going to come out right yeah, or second. Let's do it for those who appear us

19:35.180 --> 19:37.620
No idea what system. It's on or any type

19:37.620 --> 19:40.380
what if it's going to be like when I heard world of mana I thought it was

19:40.380 --> 19:47.300
going to be an MMO but no idea yet so basically what they're trying to do is

19:47.300 --> 19:52.740
with the world of mana is that they're going to try and release this across

19:52.740 --> 19:55.820
multiple platforms at once when I say multiple platforms I mean they want to

19:55.820 --> 20:01.740
do like films with it novels and manga other things so kind of interesting what

20:01.740 --> 20:06.300
they want to do with that so we'll have to see how this game turns out but we

20:06.300 --> 20:10.520
You might not only get a world amount of game, but an anime and all sorts of other things

20:10.520 --> 20:11.520
as well.

20:11.520 --> 20:14.140
You got some hack stories you wanted to share with us, Loki?

20:14.140 --> 20:17.740
Yeah, there's more emulators coming out for the PSP.

20:17.740 --> 20:21.340
Let's see, we've got development right now.

20:21.340 --> 20:27.680
They've got the ones coming out for the PC Engine, for those who don't remember that.

20:27.680 --> 20:30.660
That's the TurboGrafx-16 in the US.

20:30.660 --> 20:35.060
There's Rin, which is the Game Boy Color emulator.

20:35.060 --> 20:38.380
Version 1.1.4.1 was released.

20:38.380 --> 20:45.260
Still only playable on version 1 PSPs, but however, there is some information saying

20:45.260 --> 20:50.140
that they think they may have found a way to get it to work on 1.5s, which are all the

20:50.140 --> 20:51.140
US versions.

20:51.140 --> 20:53.460
So you'll have to check that out.

20:53.460 --> 21:02.860
Other things I should mention about the PSP is Gamapack for the Wipeout Pure was released

21:02.860 --> 21:03.860
this week.

21:03.860 --> 21:08.380
I downloaded it, I checked it out, and I didn't care because it was like one track and a couple

21:08.380 --> 21:09.380
new.

21:09.380 --> 21:12.740
I've just kind of given up on Wipeout Pure.

21:12.740 --> 21:17.700
I just use it for the browser hacks and it's interesting.

21:17.700 --> 21:25.240
Also I forgot to mention I got to play online using the infrastructure mode in the PSP so

21:25.240 --> 21:29.360
over the internet I got to play Twisted Metal head on with some other people and that was

21:29.360 --> 21:30.360
pretty interesting.

21:30.360 --> 21:35.120
No lag, but people were dropping out of the rooms like crazy so it kind of sucked.

21:35.120 --> 21:39.880
But it's funny enough that people are using Twisted Metal head on more for chat than anything

21:39.880 --> 21:42.800
because there's actually like chat rooms.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.120
So I thought that was funny.

21:44.120 --> 21:49.000
Speaking of chat on portable gaming systems, one thing we didn't go into too much detail

21:49.000 --> 21:53.280
on our podcast from E3 about was the voice over IP thing that they were showing off at

21:53.280 --> 21:54.280
Nintendo's booth.

21:54.280 --> 21:57.160
Kind of interesting, different, interesting.

21:57.160 --> 22:05.720
Speaking of voice over IP stuff, there's actually a guy that was working as actually part of

22:05.720 --> 22:18.520
a voice over IP company and he's saying a CEO Eric Lagerway from X10 it's like a VoIP

22:18.520 --> 22:24.240
phone company he's trying to get his software to run on a PSP so he's trying to get voice

22:24.240 --> 22:27.080
over IP chat for the PSP.

22:27.080 --> 22:29.360
Something new coming to handhelds.

22:29.360 --> 22:34.640
Speaking of handhelds one thing that kind of surprised people at the show was the Gizmondo

22:34.640 --> 22:38.780
That was a brand new system coming out from Tiger and what they're trying to do

22:38.780 --> 22:41.980
with this, it's already available in Europe but it's going to be coming out here.

22:41.980 --> 22:46.460
Not only will it play games but it's supposed to do movies and music

22:46.460 --> 22:50.180
and of course you kind of think, well so can my PSP, but then also it does pictures

22:50.180 --> 22:51.500
with a built-in camera

22:51.500 --> 22:54.540
and you can send it to other Gizmondo users

22:54.540 --> 22:59.260
and other mobile phone users as well. It also has a built-in GPS system in it.

22:59.260 --> 23:02.080
Kind of interesting. Bluetooth in it as well.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.980
Did you get a chance to check out the Gizmondo?

23:03.980 --> 23:04.980
A little bit.

23:04.980 --> 23:09.220
When I went by the booth, it was so loud over there and I couldn't handle it because they

23:09.220 --> 23:13.300
had some, it was kind of enclosed and they had some performance going on over there and

23:13.300 --> 23:16.380
it was crowded, so I didn't really get to see too much of the system, but it looked

23:16.380 --> 23:17.380
interesting.

23:17.380 --> 23:23.640
I was already more interested in it than I was in, say, the N-Gage, so that's something

23:23.640 --> 23:25.580
good for it right there.

23:25.580 --> 23:26.980
Didn't you check out one of the games?

23:26.980 --> 23:30.880
I tried out the one music game that they had there.

23:30.880 --> 23:38.600
It was interesting, I don't know, it was kind of, the load time on it was killer, it was

23:38.600 --> 23:40.220
just like, oh my god.

23:40.220 --> 23:43.760
Load time was pretty bad, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.

23:43.760 --> 23:47.600
Do you think the Gizmondo stands a chance against things like the DS and the PSP?

23:47.600 --> 23:48.600
Maybe?

23:48.600 --> 23:51.840
It definitely stands a chance against, they say, the N-Gage.

23:51.840 --> 23:56.080
And I think it's got some pretty good stuff for it, I don't know if it's got a phone capability

23:56.080 --> 24:00.080
with the Gizmondo, but it's got a camera built into it, so that's kind of neat.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.480
The interface wasn't that bad.

24:02.480 --> 24:06.960
The game was pretty cool, I just couldn't hear much of it because the sound wasn't working

24:06.960 --> 24:12.140
too well because the people were rapping like four feet away from me.

24:12.140 --> 24:16.780
But if they fixed the load time issue, I assume that just because it was a demo they had the

24:16.780 --> 24:22.480
huge load time because that thing loaded for five minutes and now that's unacceptable.

24:22.480 --> 24:27.840
But I assume because it's probably not finished that that's probably the case.

24:27.840 --> 24:32.560
But if that's what is going to be the final version, then no, I would not recommend it.

24:32.560 --> 24:37.600
But otherwise, it looks like it would be pretty cool.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.920
Some little controversies going on at E3 in regards to some of the conferences.

24:41.920 --> 24:46.440
It seems like a lot of folks were not impressed with the big three's conferences this year.

24:46.440 --> 24:50.280
Microsoft, many claims coming out that they had plants in the audience that would sit

24:50.280 --> 24:54.760
there and act all enthusiastically and that the media was kind of just not amused with

24:54.760 --> 24:55.760
it.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.500
You know, that Microsoft had plants in the audience.

24:57.500 --> 25:01.800
One rumor there, PS3 rumor going around that some of their videos that they were claiming

25:01.800 --> 25:04.900
were real-time were actually pre-rendered videos.

25:04.900 --> 25:06.680
Some of the materials they showed from Killzone 2.

25:06.680 --> 25:11.640
Well yeah, because now the PS3's graphics and stuff are so good, it does look like pre-rendered

25:11.640 --> 25:14.360
video, but it's not.

25:14.360 --> 25:19.200
They showed, I mean, I was looking at some of the conference stuff that they were showing.

25:19.200 --> 25:23.220
There's not, you know, there's no way that they're saying that's pre-rendered video because

25:23.220 --> 25:26.740
they're showing like real-time, the guy's moving the stuff around, taking like a model

25:26.740 --> 25:29.320
of the one guy who played Dr. Octopus

25:29.320 --> 25:32.720
and adjusting the light in the stuff

25:32.720 --> 25:35.860
and they modeled the room and stuff.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.420
There's no way that, I mean,

25:37.420 --> 25:39.260
they're showing live footage of that

25:39.260 --> 25:41.460
and I don't, there's no way.

25:41.460 --> 25:43.000
Oh, that'd be interesting.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.400
And then just an overall general sigh

25:45.400 --> 25:46.760
at Nintendo's conference this year

25:46.760 --> 25:48.400
that really their ace in the hole

25:48.400 --> 25:51.040
is Zelda Twilight Princess and that's about it.

25:51.040 --> 25:52.600
Not a whole lot of details on Revolution

25:52.600 --> 25:55.580
and the Game Boy Micro, not that impressive.

25:55.580 --> 25:58.060
how are you supposed to read text on that thing, huh?

25:58.060 --> 25:59.900
If you want to play a Pokemon game,

25:59.900 --> 26:04.380
you gotta get out your binoculars, or your magnifying glass, rather,

26:04.380 --> 26:07.120
and try to read some of the text on that thing.

26:07.120 --> 26:09.980
You know what's sad is I think they're trying to make...

26:09.980 --> 26:10.620
I mean,

26:10.620 --> 26:14.500
why aren't they just instead of developing this new Game Boy Advance, which really did

26:14.500 --> 26:16.400
they really needed to do that? They didn't.

26:16.400 --> 26:19.380
The Game Boy Advance SPO is fine, people liked it.

26:19.380 --> 26:23.940
I don't see why you need that. Yeah, I'm a little surprised at the micro as well. It was kind of one of those things where I was like,

26:23.940 --> 26:26.740
Okay, I'm sure, why not, I guess.

26:26.740 --> 26:28.940
It seems like something, are they trying to design

26:28.940 --> 26:30.820
something that people want to put on their key chains

26:30.820 --> 26:32.380
and stuff, is that what it is?

26:32.380 --> 26:35.380
I think what they're trying to do is they're trying

26:35.380 --> 26:37.180
to make it a music player too,

26:37.180 --> 26:39.300
because apparently it has a music player add-on to it.

26:39.300 --> 26:40.380
Huh, that would be interesting.

26:40.380 --> 26:44.660
But, you know, stop, leave the music business

26:44.660 --> 26:46.300
for the people that want to do the music business,

26:46.300 --> 26:48.300
like the iPods and stuff.

26:48.300 --> 26:51.980
Why does, you know, Microsoft and Nintendo

26:51.980 --> 26:56.220
and like so many have to try to get in on that music and started as the music

26:56.220 --> 26:59.740
thing is really a revolutionary now we're moving from a cd age to a digital

26:59.740 --> 27:02.340
age and everybody wants a piece of it

27:02.340 --> 27:06.020
stomped the poor guys they get left in the duster here's a here's a problem is

27:06.020 --> 27:08.960
we're a make these console systems that can do everything but

27:08.960 --> 27:11.080
gaming

27:11.080 --> 27:15.020
that's the problem is there are a lot of plays dvds in a place your ipod the

27:15.020 --> 27:16.260
number of the book

27:16.260 --> 27:17.740
you have a game suck

27:17.740 --> 27:18.780
you know

27:18.780 --> 27:21.560
or yeah they look pretty but they'd be sock

27:21.560 --> 27:22.720
you know it's

27:22.720 --> 27:25.180
i'd i'm afraid that's where to run into

27:25.180 --> 27:28.680
cuz i can tell you this much i played a few games that he three that look good

27:28.680 --> 27:31.000
but they sucked

27:31.000 --> 27:32.000
house that work

27:32.000 --> 27:36.200
of it they look pretty but they're just not they're not fun like what they want

27:36.200 --> 27:39.480
l a rush couldn't free nor to play the game you have to actually look at the

27:39.480 --> 27:42.120
map because it's so detailed stuff

27:42.120 --> 27:45.720
there's no indicator we're supposed to go so you have to find your own path to

27:45.720 --> 27:47.020
the checkpoint

27:47.020 --> 27:50.980
half the times I get stuck in an alley or something I'm all good I gotta turn around now

27:50.980 --> 27:54.680
and you end up in last place because you can't find your way around

27:54.680 --> 27:59.700
it's just because there's so much detail oh it looks good but you know what I can't play it

27:59.700 --> 28:03.560
it's not fun it's not like you know San Francisco rush where

28:03.560 --> 28:07.860
it was in a city but the tracks were laid out you couldn't really deviate from the

28:07.860 --> 28:09.340
tracks that much

28:09.340 --> 28:12.860
not that I really cared but I mean there are shortcuts and stuff that's what I was

28:12.860 --> 28:14.300
looking for an LA rush

28:14.300 --> 28:17.500
I was expecting it to be just like San Francisco Rush.

28:17.500 --> 28:23.060
Better graphics, different city, same type of gameplay because that's what I expected

28:23.060 --> 28:27.300
with the Rush series and then they went and changed it up on me to try to make it better

28:27.300 --> 28:29.180
and it's not fun.

28:29.180 --> 28:32.580
Alright, well that's the last story I have.

28:32.580 --> 28:33.860
You have anything else?

28:33.860 --> 28:35.260
I have nothing.

28:35.260 --> 28:39.620
I'm looking more into that Nintendo Revolution video and I couldn't find anything.

28:39.620 --> 28:46.580
Well, more E3 Fallout to come on our next podcast and et cetera, et cetera, and we'll

28:46.580 --> 28:48.540
be here with you guys to tell you the latest.

28:48.540 --> 28:50.500
Oh, yeah, I forgot to mention also.

28:50.500 --> 28:54.940
I bought Smart Bomb and I played it and I cannot recommend that game to anyone.

28:54.940 --> 28:59.220
Load times are long, it's frustrating, it makes you want to throw the PSP.

28:59.220 --> 29:00.220
Don't buy it.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.220
All right.

29:01.220 --> 29:03.100
That was a little random, but that's all right.

29:03.100 --> 29:05.740
Any other random final thoughts that you might have?

29:05.740 --> 29:07.420
No, that's it.

29:07.420 --> 29:14.380
All right, and I guess my final thought would be send us email to go to go at orange lounge radio calm

29:14.380 --> 29:18.960
Or did you know if you want to address one of us specifically you can write Matt at orange launch radio calm

29:19.160 --> 29:23.620
Jamie at orange launch radio calm and or myself Rob at orange launch radio calm

29:23.860 --> 29:30.420
We were here for you. So but our general show email is to go to geo at orange launch radio calm

29:30.420 --> 29:34.860
I don't get email I get spam. I don't know how that works. None of the rest of us get spammed

29:34.860 --> 29:41.860
Have a good one you guys, we'll see you next time on the Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.
