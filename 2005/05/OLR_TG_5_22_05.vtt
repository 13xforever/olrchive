00:00.265 --> 00:03.387
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 23rd, 2005.

00:03.547 --> 00:14.334
[SPEAKER_00]: You're tuned in to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your podcast home for all the latest video game news and gamer chat.

00:14.614 --> 00:18.116
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, here are your hosts, DarkSakura, Sky, and Loki.

00:20.518 --> 00:23.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, everybody, again from back home.

00:24.602 --> 00:27.745
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of nice to be back home, although E3 was pretty exciting.

00:27.785 --> 00:29.606
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very nice to be back home.

00:30.427 --> 00:34.710
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome to our podcast, the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, where we talk about games that don't suck.

00:34.810 --> 00:35.671
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Rob Roberts.

00:35.691 --> 00:36.572
[SPEAKER_02]: You might know me as Sky.

00:37.192 --> 00:39.414
[SPEAKER_02]: Joining me is my co-host, Loki.

00:39.994 --> 00:40.415
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.

00:40.975 --> 00:42.777
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other co-host, DarkSakura.

00:42.837 --> 00:47.781
[SPEAKER_02]: She is not here tonight because she is coming back from LA the day that we're taping this podcast.

00:47.801 --> 00:50.343
[SPEAKER_02]: She stayed a couple days extra so she could go to Disneyland and stuff.

00:51.524 --> 00:57.387
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually went a couple days early so we could go check out the More Friends concert, which happened on Monday night.

00:57.427 --> 00:59.008
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the More Friends concert, Loki?

00:59.208 --> 01:03.570
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good, but it was littered with technical issues.

01:03.670 --> 01:04.891
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of thought the same thing.

01:04.931 --> 01:10.394
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of sound problems, and I think whoever was behind arranging the sound and stuff for that show is going to get canned.

01:11.195 --> 01:16.838
[SPEAKER_02]: And the real too bad part is that it probably jeopardizes whether that is going to happen in the future or not.

01:16.858 --> 01:17.978
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of sad.

01:18.179 --> 01:18.739
[SPEAKER_02]: I almost feel like

01:19.519 --> 01:22.500
[SPEAKER_02]: because the audience reception was kind of lukewarm to it.

01:23.060 --> 01:26.140
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's too bad because they did some amazing things at the concert.

01:26.160 --> 01:36.962
[SPEAKER_02]: The opera scene that they did was great, and the Black Mages rocked, and that combination at the very end, they played one wing angel, combined the Black Mages and the orchestra and the choir.

01:37.362 --> 01:38.122
[SPEAKER_02]: It was amazing.

01:38.282 --> 01:38.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:39.162 --> 01:44.963
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just kind of too bad that because of the sound issues, when I say sound issue, I mean like during like Eris' theme and stuff, when you hear that...

01:48.649 --> 01:50.750
[SPEAKER_02]: You'd hear these big popping noises and things like that.

01:50.951 --> 01:52.572
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sound of stuff exploding.

01:52.852 --> 01:56.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the MC's mic didn't work for some of it and a bunch of other stuff.

01:56.074 --> 01:56.834
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too bad.

01:57.115 --> 01:58.235
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really sad.

01:58.436 --> 02:03.379
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, overall, it's nobody, no talent person's fault.

02:03.499 --> 02:04.620
[SPEAKER_02]: The orchestra was great.

02:04.700 --> 02:05.620
[SPEAKER_02]: The singers were great.

02:06.581 --> 02:09.523
[SPEAKER_02]: Uematsu and his band were awesome.

02:09.603 --> 02:10.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Overall, it was a good time.

02:10.904 --> 02:17.828
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just too bad that some bad sound department can really screw up a show like that and kind of make the whole thing look bad.

02:19.029 --> 02:20.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for watching!

02:36.142 --> 03:05.179
[SPEAKER_02]: and a laptop and now we're back to having our mixing board and our nicer microphones so we hope you guys enjoyed our podcast from E3 nonetheless we want to do it again next year hopefully do some interviews and things like that as well just as this podcast continues to grow and if you haven't checked it out yet subscribe to our podcast and catch up on your iPod or Doppler or whatever program you use catch up on the feeds and check it out or you can look at our portal on like Podcast Alley or Podcast Pickle any of those sites ought to have

03:05.826 --> 03:09.049
[SPEAKER_02]: A record of all the shows we have currently on file.

03:09.269 --> 03:09.770
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty cool.

03:10.410 --> 03:11.831
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's talk about our gaming week.

03:11.871 --> 03:14.734
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, obviously, we were at E3 most of the week.

03:14.834 --> 03:19.498
[SPEAKER_02]: But out of curiosity, was there any games that you played that wasn't at E3?

03:19.578 --> 03:21.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Something else maybe you played, Loki.

03:22.761 --> 03:27.005
[SPEAKER_01]: I played a lot of Rengoku Tower Purgatory.

03:27.025 --> 03:29.587
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, the game kind of grew on me just because I figured out a way...

03:31.833 --> 03:33.234
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of good and bad for the game.

04:00.666 --> 04:03.068
[SPEAKER_01]: Say you have this one weapon, which is a double claw.

04:03.088 --> 04:08.173
[SPEAKER_01]: If you attach it to your arm, it's actually like a claw if you attach it to your head, it's almost like horns or something.

04:08.953 --> 04:21.324
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I've been going through this game and just, you know, kind of basically like leveling up on each floor, but the problem is I figured out a way to level up so fast that I'm unstoppable now.

04:21.424 --> 04:25.808
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's kind of a flaw in the game, but it makes it fun at the same time.

04:25.928 --> 04:27.450
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know how to describe it, but...

04:28.363 --> 04:37.410
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm really powerful and I figured a way to kill everything like super quick and I guess, I don't know, but I don't really play much of the game.

04:37.430 --> 04:39.592
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not really much depth to it.

04:39.672 --> 04:43.015
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just kind of you go level to level and you rise up this tower.

04:43.815 --> 04:49.880
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what the plot line is, but it's kind of fun and attaching all these different weapons to you and you have to think a little bit.

04:50.180 --> 04:52.182
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like Armored Core in a sense, I guess.

04:52.702 --> 04:56.966
[SPEAKER_01]: But I was playing a lot of that and more Ridge Racer for the PSP and I was...

04:58.066 --> 04:58.686
[SPEAKER_01]: DX Download Station

05:24.865 --> 05:26.706
[SPEAKER_02]: to take Meteos back to the hotel.

05:27.206 --> 05:38.731
[SPEAKER_02]: And LankyStyle and myself, you might know him from some of the programs on Orange Launch Radio's live station, we actually played Meteos Versus because we both downloaded it from the DS download station.

05:38.971 --> 05:41.072
[SPEAKER_02]: We played Versus in the hotel room later on that night.

05:41.602 --> 05:42.363
[SPEAKER_02]: So much fun.

05:42.923 --> 05:43.604
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great game.

05:45.105 --> 05:53.072
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember back on the podcast, I kind of was annoyed with the DS download station the first day because it was hard to get in there and get anything because it was always crowded.

05:53.493 --> 05:56.615
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, once you got in there and got something, it was a pretty neat concept.

05:56.656 --> 06:02.781
[SPEAKER_02]: And being able to put your DS to sleep, I wish I had still slept the damn thing and I could still have that Meteos demo, but.

06:03.151 --> 06:04.872
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just have to wait until next week when the game comes out.

06:05.432 --> 06:06.392
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great puzzler.

06:06.532 --> 06:12.075
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy the DS... Honestly, the E3 really did restore my faith in the DS.

06:12.235 --> 06:17.357
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so happy because really right now, there's not a lot of great stuff out for it, but there's so much good stuff on the horizon.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.037
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy.

06:18.057 --> 06:22.219
[SPEAKER_01]: Nintendogs needs to be pushed up to say, I don't know, next week.

06:22.839 --> 06:25.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Seriously, but the last date we hear from Nintendogs I think was August 22nd.

06:25.380 --> 06:27.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that.

06:27.884 --> 06:28.084
[SPEAKER_02]: E3, E3, E3, E3

06:53.129 --> 06:54.649
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 100,000, I don't know.

06:55.089 --> 06:59.291
[SPEAKER_02]: A little high, but 70,000 people attended this year's E3 Expo.

06:59.311 --> 07:03.312
[SPEAKER_02]: To put this into perspective a little bit for you guys, last year's E3 Expo was 58,000.

07:03.832 --> 07:08.554
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was 12,000 more people at E3 this year compared to last year.

07:09.374 --> 07:14.175
[SPEAKER_02]: The Los Angeles Convention Center is 547,000 square feet.

07:14.996 --> 07:19.277
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about putting 70,000 people in that, now granted they aren't always all there at once, but still,

07:19.599 --> 07:19.739
[SPEAKER_02]: E3 May 10-12, 2016

07:43.900 --> 07:45.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're not going to be able to make it?

07:45.321 --> 07:50.205
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm assuming I'm not going to be able to make it because I'm getting married that Sunday before.

07:50.265 --> 07:52.607
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that would be a good reason why you can't go.

07:52.627 --> 07:55.248
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't think... I'm not even going to try pushing it.

07:55.288 --> 07:57.410
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's just bad news.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.632
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a very interesting story actually turned up on GameSpot.

08:00.672 --> 08:03.174
[SPEAKER_02]: You may not be the only one that doesn't get to go next year.

08:03.214 --> 08:04.996
[SPEAKER_02]: A very interesting article on GameSpot.

08:05.696 --> 08:09.539
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of a little bit of an interview with the show director, Mary Dolier.

08:09.679 --> 08:10.900
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry if I mispronounced that there.

08:11.440 --> 08:11.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

08:12.361 --> 08:15.602
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about some changes that they want to make to the show.

08:15.642 --> 08:19.483
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of the article talks about should they make the show public.

08:19.803 --> 08:24.964
[SPEAKER_02]: And they don't really want to make the show public, even though there have been cries to do that for a long time.

08:24.984 --> 08:26.805
[SPEAKER_02]: But trust me, guys, it's crowded enough as it is.

08:28.425 --> 08:34.006
[SPEAKER_02]: And what the director said is, quote, the biggest headache is trying to keep the consumers from coming to the show.

08:34.446 --> 08:35.807
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone feels that they should come.

08:35.827 --> 08:38.487
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a number of people that will work at a retail outlet.

08:38.787 --> 08:41.208
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll get a job there and work there for two weeks and

08:41.328 --> 08:41.768
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

09:03.567 --> 09:08.811
[SPEAKER_02]: So the director of the show is kind of aware of what's going on, so it'll be very interesting to see if there's any changes to next year's show.

09:09.292 --> 09:14.776
[SPEAKER_02]: They did reject their saying 16,000 people this year, so interesting.

09:17.318 --> 09:22.643
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course they're talking about that they will kind of re-evaluate things and see what they should do.

09:22.983 --> 09:25.625
[SPEAKER_01]: More credentials, that's all it really comes down to is just, you know,

09:26.095 --> 09:33.879
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe instead of asking for one paste, maybe ask for the most recent paste or something like that, like one that's only a few weeks old or something.

09:34.719 --> 09:50.167
[SPEAKER_02]: The final word here in this article from the director, as far as the improvement side, we'll continually watch the registration and try to set policies and make sure that we're really letting in only the quality people and staff up with more registration people to make sure we keep it to just the people who should be here.

09:51.148 --> 09:51.688
[SPEAKER_02]: Very interesting.

09:53.079 --> 09:58.203
[SPEAKER_02]: So, unfortunately, if you guys are a little bummed that it's kind of hard to go to E3, it's going to get harder next year.

09:58.223 --> 10:04.527
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it sucks, too, because now that you get in, but they want, like, oh, well, we have some of the consumers coming in, let's make it all media only.

10:04.767 --> 10:08.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean... Yeah, so we kind of complained about it earlier, so... Interesting.

10:09.410 --> 10:10.932
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens with E3 next year.

10:10.972 --> 10:15.875
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, there won't be any word on next year's E3 outside of the date until much later on.

10:16.676 --> 10:19.857
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking around the internet, there's some other stories that come up as well.

10:20.777 --> 10:24.878
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that was interesting that wasn't at E3 this year was the Phantom Console.

10:24.918 --> 10:27.999
[SPEAKER_02]: Now remember that they had a huge booth last year?

10:28.419 --> 10:31.600
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a huge booth showing off the Phantom Console, and it was supposed to be this big thing.

10:31.620 --> 10:32.960
[SPEAKER_02]: You can download games online.

10:33.360 --> 10:37.441
[SPEAKER_02]: We heard rumors they were going to be there at E3 this year, but nope, nothing.

10:37.481 --> 10:38.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it with me, folks.

10:38.801 --> 10:39.261
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporware.

10:39.321 --> 10:39.682
[SPEAKER_01]: Vaporware.

10:40.482 --> 10:41.322
[SPEAKER_02]: Vaporware.

10:42.335 --> 10:43.259
[SPEAKER_02]: An article on CNNMoney.com

10:48.330 --> 11:01.321
[SPEAKER_02]: The company believes, based on past performance, that there is a high likelihood that sufficient capital will not be available and many or all of these milestones will be missed and the launch date will again shift and or the company will go out of business.

11:01.341 --> 11:04.444
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no market for it anymore because all these new game consoles are coming out.

11:04.884 --> 11:05.705
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much what it is.

11:06.085 --> 11:08.988
[SPEAKER_01]: You can download content, you can play games online with your friends.

11:09.468 --> 11:10.349
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just too late.

11:10.569 --> 11:14.132
[SPEAKER_01]: They did not get this console out fast enough and...

11:14.907 --> 11:17.589
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if they were to try to push it out now, it's going to be a failure.

11:18.909 --> 11:23.592
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say count your losses now and just don't release it.

11:23.612 --> 11:28.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Or maybe try to team up your technology with one of the folks that's going into this very soon.

11:28.535 --> 11:31.057
[SPEAKER_02]: Although I doubt something like that would happen.

11:31.377 --> 11:32.137
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose you never know.

11:33.358 --> 11:35.339
[SPEAKER_02]: So there goes the Phantom console.

11:35.719 --> 11:37.020
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gone forever yet.

11:37.200 --> 11:40.682
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to take one of those because that would make a really cool case mod.

11:40.762 --> 11:41.623
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know...

11:42.754 --> 11:46.683
[SPEAKER_01]: I granted they had a really cool the console look cool I mean

11:47.532 --> 11:50.273
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot better than, say, the Revolution.

11:50.773 --> 11:52.093
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the design of it.

11:52.553 --> 11:59.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of the Revolution, the Revolution was starting to feel like vaporware a little bit as well as E3 because we didn't see a whole lot on it.

11:59.635 --> 12:01.535
[SPEAKER_02]: We did get to see some early console designs.

12:02.135 --> 12:08.497
[SPEAKER_02]: They are promising that they will reveal more details about the Revolution by the end of this year, which makes sense.

12:08.517 --> 12:09.517
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to have to, really.

12:10.617 --> 12:14.658
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing that did happen is that the company's Japanese site for Nintendo...

12:15.118 --> 12:36.285
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually released some new images of the revolution and it actually shows the revolution in some different colors Including, I'm bringing this picture up in studio right now so look you can see this There's actually black and white and then there's like this pinkish color And this really like barfy yellow color that the revolution is supposed to be coming in Very interesting, hmm?

12:37.247 --> 12:38.968
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't look like a Nintendo console to me.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.029
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a PS2.

12:40.089 --> 12:41.611
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a disk drive.

12:41.671 --> 12:42.411
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so weird.

12:42.572 --> 12:45.414
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks like a micro ITX PC case.

12:45.534 --> 12:48.016
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, there are micro ITX PC cases.

12:49.297 --> 12:50.058
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing.

12:50.418 --> 12:51.279
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a box.

12:51.940 --> 12:53.621
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, it's a box with a glowing CD drive.

12:53.881 --> 12:56.183
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow, you went out on a limb to make that one.

12:56.463 --> 12:59.686
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can't knock the system until we get more details.

12:59.706 --> 13:00.827
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm knocking it right now.

13:01.027 --> 13:02.028
[SPEAKER_01]: It looks ugly.

13:02.168 --> 13:03.750
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like you didn't...

13:04.250 --> 13:04.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Spend any time.

13:04.951 --> 13:10.256
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, granted the PlayStation 3 isn't much better, but at least it looks sleek and it looks nice.

13:10.356 --> 13:12.979
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's something you'd want to have in your house because it looks cool.

13:13.379 --> 13:17.383
[SPEAKER_01]: The Revolution looks like something I'm going to shove next to my VCR because it's small.

13:18.348 --> 13:34.802
[SPEAKER_02]: What's interesting is that also what you can notice on the console from these screenshots is you can actually see a flip top that will reveal some GameCube style controller ports as well as GameCube memory card slots, which makes sense if this is going to be a backwards compatible system.

13:35.082 --> 13:37.284
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to have this somewhere on the system as well.

13:38.445 --> 13:43.529
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, the system is supposed to have, of course, as we already know, wireless controls and an internal flash memory.

13:43.905 --> 13:48.610
[SPEAKER_02]: So this stuff is all kind of extra, but there's that flip top there, Loki, if you haven't seen that yet.

13:48.630 --> 13:49.431
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of cool.

13:49.491 --> 13:49.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13:49.872 --> 13:51.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, now one little cool thing.

13:51.934 --> 13:52.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

13:52.595 --> 13:54.097
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's kind of cool that it's on there.

13:54.117 --> 13:55.138
[SPEAKER_01]: It still looks like a box.

13:57.420 --> 13:57.701
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

13:57.721 --> 14:00.344
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll hopefully see a little more on the Nintendo Revolution later on.

14:00.404 --> 14:02.166
[SPEAKER_02]: But that'll be cool for case spotting.

14:03.085 --> 14:04.926
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you have something on Nintendo Revolution you wanted to share?

14:05.266 --> 14:05.646
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no.

14:05.826 --> 14:06.527
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a couple things.

14:06.687 --> 14:12.930
[SPEAKER_01]: First, there was an article that came out that was saying, oh, the Revolution's going to be able to run homebrew code on it.

14:12.970 --> 14:13.670
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's excited.

14:13.790 --> 14:14.891
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yay, homebrew code.

14:15.251 --> 14:18.432
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's another article that came out that said, no, you're not going to be able to run homebrew code.

14:18.452 --> 14:23.555
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, there's going to be a new digital rights management thing in place where it'll be impossible for you to run homebrew code.

14:23.635 --> 14:28.057
[SPEAKER_01]: And impossible, of course, meaning that it will take a little bit more time to run homebrew code on it.

14:29.826 --> 14:32.388
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see what's going to happen, honestly.

14:32.748 --> 14:33.729
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know what's funny?

14:33.909 --> 14:41.173
[SPEAKER_01]: Last night I was trying to download the full videos for... Remember that Revolution thing that was out with the video and everything?

14:41.994 --> 14:44.035
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting, that whole video.

14:44.075 --> 14:45.336
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan video you're talking about?

14:45.376 --> 14:45.716
[SPEAKER_01]: The fan one.

14:45.756 --> 14:46.717
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, the fan-made video.

14:46.777 --> 14:50.679
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's got that case design, though, in it.

14:50.859 --> 14:55.602
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know when that video came out, but it's got that same case design with the other thing.

14:56.288 --> 14:56.829
[SPEAKER_01]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura

15:17.640 --> 15:30.438
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody goes to E3 and this happened to me last year too it's like there's something you completely freaking missed at the show and you're like how did I miss this I walked the show floor like four times and I somehow completely missed this well I feel embarrassed that I missed this one

15:30.933 --> 15:31.393
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know what?

15:31.413 --> 15:35.955
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much stuff that goes on at E3 that sometimes, you know, you just miss the most obvious things.

15:36.315 --> 15:38.315
[SPEAKER_02]: There's actually a brand new Mario Bros.

15:38.375 --> 15:44.177
[SPEAKER_02]: game coming to the DS, and I don't mean some Mario franchise, you know, Mario Baseball, Mario DDR, whatever.

15:44.257 --> 15:46.278
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking a Mario Bros.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.799
[SPEAKER_02]: side-scroll game is coming out for the DS.

15:49.319 --> 15:49.759
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that.

15:50.299 --> 15:50.959
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of this?

15:51.039 --> 15:52.480
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't hear you bring this up on the podcast.

15:52.500 --> 15:53.060
[SPEAKER_02]: It looked dumb.

15:53.560 --> 15:53.880
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?

15:54.901 --> 15:55.761
[SPEAKER_02]: How did it look dumb?

15:56.101 --> 15:58.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's Mario... The screenshots I saw looked pretty sweet.

15:59.878 --> 16:04.482
[SPEAKER_01]: It just reminded me of like Paper Mario.

16:04.522 --> 16:05.603
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like Paper Mario.

16:06.764 --> 16:13.849
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been bitter with Paper Mario because it's not Mario RPG and they want to say it's Mario RPG 2 and it's... No.

16:14.390 --> 16:22.056
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyways, no, it's just... If they're going to do a new Mario game, it's got to be old school like graphics, 2D, that type of thing.

16:22.076 --> 16:24.978
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's kind of what they're going for is what it looked like.

16:25.058 --> 16:25.839
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see.

16:25.899 --> 16:28.922
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other cool thing I thought is have you like...

16:29.969 --> 16:31.350
[SPEAKER_02]: If you remember Super Smash Bros.

16:31.390 --> 16:36.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Melee, there's like that stage where you actually kind of play like Mario when you're going through like the adventure mode or something like that.

16:36.972 --> 16:37.812
[SPEAKER_02]: That was cool.

16:38.032 --> 16:38.753
[SPEAKER_02]: That was so cool.

16:39.053 --> 16:44.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Like they should make an entire like GameCube Mario in that regard, but we'll see.

16:45.680 --> 16:46.861
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess maybe we're just wishing.

16:47.321 --> 16:49.002
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, whatever.

16:49.362 --> 16:57.587
[SPEAKER_02]: One big surprise at the show about the Xbox 360, Square Enix is hopping on board because Final Fantasy XI will be released for the Xbox 360.

16:57.968 --> 17:03.151
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumor was that it was going to have graphic upgrades, but apparently those rumors are actually being shot down.

17:03.171 --> 17:05.953
[SPEAKER_02]: It will not have graphic upgrades in it.

17:05.993 --> 17:07.113
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be the same thing.

17:07.514 --> 17:08.514
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the deal.

17:08.754 --> 17:11.356
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is really what it is, if you think about it.

17:11.958 --> 17:15.815
[SPEAKER_02]: If you play on the PS2, you're playing in like 640x480 low-res mode.

17:17.677 --> 17:19.237
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks fine on a TV.

17:19.297 --> 17:21.758
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you play that same mode on a computer, it looks a little choppy.

17:22.278 --> 17:23.219
[SPEAKER_02]: But it looks fine on TV.

17:23.639 --> 17:27.440
[SPEAKER_02]: I imagine what they're doing with the Xbox is it's just like playing it on a high-end PC.

17:28.240 --> 17:32.701
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you port that to a television set, it looks really, really clean.

17:33.061 --> 17:34.382
[SPEAKER_02]: So I imagine that's just what it is.

17:34.422 --> 17:35.222
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a high-end computer.

17:35.282 --> 17:35.882
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all it is.

17:35.902 --> 17:39.123
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be because it's HDTV compatible.

17:39.203 --> 17:40.703
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to be high-end graphics.

17:41.023 --> 17:45.104
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to exceed that of the actual PC version.

17:45.164 --> 17:47.085
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some difference.

17:47.461 --> 17:54.826
[SPEAKER_02]: Some other questions were answered at a press conference that Square Enix held after the show in regards to Final Fantasy XI, among with some other Square Enix games.

17:55.206 --> 18:00.630
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XI will use the same servers on the Xbox 360 as the PC or PS2.

18:01.030 --> 18:03.772
[SPEAKER_02]: Rumors are going around to the contrary, but they put those to rest.

18:04.693 --> 18:07.454
[SPEAKER_02]: So you will play on the same servers that everyone else plays on.

18:07.495 --> 18:13.679
[SPEAKER_02]: So it'll be, I think, the first game to be cross-server across three different platforms, I think.

18:14.239 --> 18:14.539
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

18:14.599 --> 18:14.879
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

18:15.740 --> 18:17.262
[SPEAKER_02]: Final Fantasy XII was not playable at E3.

18:17.282 --> 18:23.871
[SPEAKER_02]: They claim it was an issue of timing, but they are saying they will have it playable at the end of July in some type of private setting.

18:35.259 --> 18:40.543
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think our rumors that we completely made up about the fact that it's being pushed for PlayStation 3 are false.

18:40.623 --> 18:41.885
[SPEAKER_02]: It will come out on PS2.

18:42.425 --> 18:45.768
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'll tell you what, it looks damn good.

18:45.868 --> 18:55.035
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly, the movie we saw inside the Square Enix Theater, when you see this thing, you would have a hard time believing it's PS2 as well.

18:55.055 --> 18:55.716
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks very good.

18:58.079 --> 19:03.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Square Enix will be dubbing Final Fantasy VII Advent Children in English when they release it here in America.

19:04.921 --> 19:10.423
[SPEAKER_02]: No word yet if they will do it in Japanese with English subtitles as well, like another option on the DVD.

19:10.483 --> 19:11.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it will be.

19:11.963 --> 19:15.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the best answer they got was a we will consider the possibility.

19:16.084 --> 19:16.904
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't get a yes.

19:18.105 --> 19:18.365
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

19:18.665 --> 19:18.845
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm.

19:20.549 --> 19:26.453
[SPEAKER_02]: World of Mana was a game that was teased at E3, but really no additional information outside of that.

19:26.493 --> 19:29.195
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember seeing a trailer for it, but it really didn't show anything.

19:29.255 --> 19:31.917
[SPEAKER_02]: Just that, ooh, a new Mana game is going to come out, right?

19:32.197 --> 19:32.377
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.

19:32.497 --> 19:34.919
[SPEAKER_02]: Or Seiken Densetsu, for those of you purists.

19:35.639 --> 19:38.701
[SPEAKER_02]: No idea what system it's on or if it's going to be.

19:38.721 --> 19:42.944
[SPEAKER_02]: When I heard World of Mana, I thought it was going to be an MMO, but no idea yet.

19:42.964 --> 19:43.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

19:45.214 --> 19:54.038
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically what they're trying to do with the World of Mana is that they're going to try and release this across multiple platforms at once.

19:54.139 --> 19:59.341
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say multiple platforms, I mean they want to do films with it, novels, manga, other things.

19:59.601 --> 20:02.623
[SPEAKER_02]: So kind of interesting what they want to do with that.

20:02.823 --> 20:04.584
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have to see how this game turns out.

20:06.004 --> 20:10.907
[SPEAKER_02]: But we might not only get a World of Mana game, but an anime and all sorts of other things as well.

20:11.667 --> 20:12.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Game Boy Color Emulator

20:34.797 --> 21:02.488
[SPEAKER_01]: version 1.141 was released still only playable on version 1 PSPs but however there is some information saying that they think they might have found a way to get it to work on 1.5s which are all the US versions so you'll have to check that out other things I should mention about the PSP is Gamma Pack for the was it Wipeout Pure was released

21:02.892 --> 21:05.953
[SPEAKER_01]: This week I downloaded it, I checked it out, and I didn't care.

21:06.093 --> 21:12.594
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was like one track and a couple new... I've just kind of given up on Wipeout Pure.

21:12.855 --> 21:14.775
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use it for the browser hacks.

21:16.395 --> 21:17.116
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting.

21:17.556 --> 21:25.138
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I forgot to mention, I got to play online using the infrastructure mode in the PSP.

21:25.158 --> 21:29.039
[SPEAKER_01]: So over the internet, I got to play Twisted Metal head-on with some other people.

21:29.119 --> 21:30.179
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was pretty interesting.

21:30.219 --> 21:30.659
[SPEAKER_01]: No lag.

21:31.175 --> 21:58.936
[SPEAKER_01]: but people were dropping out of the rooms like crazy so it kind of sucked but it's funny enough that people are using Twisted Metal head-on more for chat than anything because there's actually like chat rooms so I thought that was funny speaking of chat on portable gaming systems one thing we didn't go into too much detail on our podcast from E3 about was the voice over IP thing that they were showing off at Nintendo's booth kind of interesting different interesting speaking of voice over IP stuff um

21:59.887 --> 22:07.250
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually a guy that was working as actually part of a voice over IP company.

22:07.950 --> 22:22.857
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's saying, CEO Eric Lagerwey from X10, it's like a VoIP phone company, he's trying to get his software to run on a PSP.

22:23.197 --> 22:25.998
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's trying to get voice over IP chat for the PSP.

22:26.458 --> 22:28.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Hmm, something new coming to handhelds.

22:29.292 --> 22:34.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of handhelds, one thing that kind of surprised people at the show was the Gizmondo.

22:35.055 --> 22:37.336
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a brand new system coming out from Tiger.

22:37.996 --> 22:41.738
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're trying to do with this, it's already available in Europe, but it's going to be coming out here.

22:42.699 --> 22:46.120
[SPEAKER_02]: Not only will it play games, but it's supposed to do movies and music.

22:46.581 --> 22:48.542
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course you kind of think, well so can my PSP.

22:48.602 --> 22:51.223
[SPEAKER_02]: But then also it does pictures with a built-in camera.

22:51.636 --> 22:56.417
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can send it to other Gizmondo users and other mobile phone users as well.

22:56.477 --> 22:58.858
[SPEAKER_02]: It also has a built-in GPS system in it.

22:59.298 --> 23:00.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of interesting.

23:00.218 --> 23:01.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Bluetooth in it as well.

23:02.159 --> 23:03.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get a chance to check out the Gizmondo?

23:03.839 --> 23:04.700
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit.

23:04.880 --> 23:13.882
[SPEAKER_02]: When I went by the booth, it was so loud over there and I couldn't handle it because it was kind of enclosed and they had some performance going on over there and it was crowded.

23:14.264 --> 23:17.007
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't really get to see too much of the system, but it looked interesting.

23:17.348 --> 23:20.612
[SPEAKER_02]: I was already more interested in it than I was in, say, The Engage.

23:21.092 --> 23:24.736
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's something good for it right there.

23:25.477 --> 23:26.719
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you check out one of the games?

23:26.779 --> 23:29.722
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried out the one music game that they had there.

23:30.864 --> 23:31.665
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.

23:33.146 --> 23:33.507
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.

23:33.527 --> 23:34.188
[SPEAKER_01]: It was kind of...

23:36.209 --> 23:38.230
[SPEAKER_01]: The load time on it was killer.

23:38.411 --> 23:40.072
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like, oh my god.

23:40.092 --> 23:43.194
[SPEAKER_02]: The load time was pretty bad, but hopefully it'll be fixed in a future release.

23:43.734 --> 23:46.856
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think the Gizmondo stands a chance against things like the DS and the PSP?

23:47.337 --> 23:47.657
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.

23:48.077 --> 23:50.699
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely stands a chance against, they say, the N-Gage.

23:51.707 --> 23:54.389
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's got some pretty good stuff for it.

23:54.469 --> 23:59.152
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if it's got phone capability with the games, Mondo, but it's got a camera built into it, so that's kind of neat.

23:59.893 --> 24:01.434
[SPEAKER_01]: And the interface wasn't that bad.

24:02.454 --> 24:03.635
[SPEAKER_01]: The game was pretty cool.

24:03.835 --> 24:10.360
[SPEAKER_01]: I just couldn't hear much of it because the sound wasn't working too well because the people were rapping like four feet away from me.

24:11.928 --> 24:19.431
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they fix the load time issue, I assume that just because it was a demo, they have a huge load time, because that thing loaded for a good five minutes.

24:20.872 --> 24:22.212
[SPEAKER_01]: That's unacceptable.

24:22.612 --> 24:32.376
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume, because it's probably not finished, that's probably the case, but if that's what is going to be the final version, then no, I would not recommend it.

24:32.416 --> 24:34.857
[SPEAKER_01]: But otherwise, it looks like it would be pretty cool.

24:37.492 --> 24:41.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Some little controversies going on at E3 in regards to some of the conferences.

24:41.896 --> 24:45.319
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like a lot of folks were not impressed with the big three's conferences this year.

24:45.719 --> 24:56.869
[SPEAKER_02]: Microsoft, many claims coming out that they had plants in the audience that would sit there and act all enthusiastically and that the media was kind of just not amused with it, you know, that Microsoft had plants in the audience.

24:57.469 --> 24:58.130
[SPEAKER_02]: One rumor there.

24:58.750 --> 25:04.035
[SPEAKER_02]: PS3 rumor going around that some of their videos that they were claiming were real-time were actually pre-rendered videos.

25:04.820 --> 25:06.442
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the materials they showed from Killzone 2.

25:06.482 --> 25:14.111
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, because now the PS3's graphics and stuff are so good, it does look like pre-rendered video, but it's not.

25:14.191 --> 25:19.638
[SPEAKER_01]: And they showed, I mean, I was looking at some of the conference stuff that they were showing, there's not

25:20.273 --> 25:34.710
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's no way that they're saying that's pre-rendered video, because they're showing, like, real-time, the guys moving the stuff around, taking, like, a model of the one guy who played Dr. Octopus, and adjusting the light and stuff, and they modeled the room and stuff, and

25:35.902 --> 25:36.803
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no way.

25:37.423 --> 25:41.105
[SPEAKER_01]: They're showing live footage of that, and there's no way.

25:42.106 --> 25:42.426
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.

25:43.046 --> 25:50.231
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just an overall general sigh at Nintendo's conference this year that really their ace in the hole is Zelda Twilight Princess, and that's about it.

25:51.171 --> 25:53.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a whole lot of details on Revolution and the Game Boy Micro.

25:54.633 --> 25:55.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that impressive.

25:55.374 --> 25:57.255
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you supposed to read text on that thing, huh?

25:58.135 --> 26:01.998
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to play a Pokemon game, you've got to get out your magnifying glass, rather.

26:04.403 --> 26:05.944
[SPEAKER_02]: and try to read some of the text on that thing.

26:26.956 --> 26:31.197
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like something... Are they trying to design something that people want to put on their keychains and stuff?

26:31.257 --> 26:32.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what it is?

26:32.477 --> 26:36.758
[SPEAKER_01]: I think what they're trying to do is they're trying to make another... They're trying to make it a music player, too.

26:37.098 --> 26:39.098
[SPEAKER_01]: Because apparently it has a music player add-on to it.

26:39.399 --> 26:40.299
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that would be interesting.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.119
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know... Stop!

26:43.499 --> 26:47.600
[SPEAKER_01]: Leave the music business for the people that want to do the music business, like the iPods and stuff.

26:48.380 --> 26:51.441
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does, you know, Microsoft and Nintendo...

26:52.085 --> 26:54.787
[SPEAKER_01]: and Sony have to try to get in on that music.

26:55.047 --> 26:55.347
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop.

26:55.467 --> 26:57.629
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because the music thing is truly a revolution right now.

26:57.669 --> 27:01.191
[SPEAKER_02]: We're moving from a CD age to a digital age and everybody wants a piece of it.

27:02.112 --> 27:02.772
[SPEAKER_02]: That's dumb.

27:02.832 --> 27:04.733
[SPEAKER_02]: The poor guys get left in the dust.

27:04.873 --> 27:05.974
[SPEAKER_01]: But here's the problem.

27:06.014 --> 27:09.596
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make these console systems that can do everything but gaming.

27:11.117 --> 27:11.778
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the problem.

27:12.178 --> 27:14.860
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, but it plays DVDs and it plays your iPod.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.322
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but the games suck.

27:17.942 --> 27:20.844
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they look pretty, but they suck.

27:22.018 --> 27:24.599
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm afraid that's what we're going to run into.

27:24.619 --> 27:29.661
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I can tell you this much, I've played a few games at E3 that looked good, but they sucked.

27:31.041 --> 27:31.781
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that work?

27:32.081 --> 27:34.982
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they look pretty, but they're just not fun.

27:35.262 --> 27:35.642
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what?

27:35.722 --> 27:36.103
[SPEAKER_01]: Name one.

27:36.323 --> 27:36.483
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.

27:36.543 --> 27:36.803
[SPEAKER_01]: Rush.

27:36.923 --> 27:41.644
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to play that game, you have to actually look at the map because it's so detailed and stuff.

27:42.225 --> 27:46.466
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no indicator where you're supposed to go, so you kind of have to find your own path through the checkpoints.

27:46.486 --> 27:46.606
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm.

27:47.173 --> 27:48.114
[SPEAKER_01]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

28:15.655 --> 28:16.195
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not fun.

28:16.215 --> 28:18.536
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well that's the last story I have.

28:18.576 --> 28:20.316
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything else?

28:34.199 --> 28:35.219
[SPEAKER_01]: I have nothing.

28:35.279 --> 28:39.181
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking more into that Nintendo Revolution video and I couldn't find anything.

28:39.341 --> 28:39.641
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

28:39.701 --> 28:43.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, more E3 Fallout to come on our next podcast and et cetera, et cetera.

28:44.923 --> 28:48.344
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll be here with you guys until later.

28:48.544 --> 28:48.904
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.

28:48.944 --> 28:54.706
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to mention also I bought Smart Bomb and I played it and I cannot recommend that game to anyone.

28:54.726 --> 28:55.827
[SPEAKER_01]: The load times are long.

28:56.207 --> 28:57.087
[SPEAKER_01]: It's frustrating.

28:57.107 --> 28:58.328
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes you want to throw the PSP.

28:59.068 --> 28:59.508
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't buy it.

29:00.148 --> 29:00.408
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.

29:00.589 --> 29:01.329
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a little random.

29:01.349 --> 29:01.809
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

29:03.012 --> 29:05.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other random final thoughts that you might have?

29:06.254 --> 29:06.894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's it.

29:07.855 --> 29:14.438
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, and I guess my final thought would be send us email, togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

29:14.558 --> 29:23.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Or did you know if you want to address one of us specifically, you can write Matt at orangeloungeradio.com, Jamie at orangeloungeradio.com, or myself, Rob at orangeloungeradio.com.

29:24.283 --> 29:25.544
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here for you.

29:26.904 --> 29:30.386
[SPEAKER_02]: But our general show email is togo, T-O-G-O, at orangeloungeradio.com.

29:30.925 --> 29:33.466
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio To Go edition.

29:33.486 --> 29:35.788
[SPEAKER_01]: This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com

30:00.066 --> 30:01.017
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next update!
