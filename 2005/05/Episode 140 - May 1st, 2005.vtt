Orange Islands Radio Live episode 140 is coming to you right after this song from Distance

00:38.640 --> 00:45.640
sounds time after time.

01:08.640 --> 01:23.640
You're all it to me, call it it to me

01:53.640 --> 02:00.640
Flash back, warm nights, almost left behind

02:00.640 --> 02:04.640
Single piece of memory

02:04.640 --> 02:09.640
Time after sometimes you picked me

02:09.640 --> 02:16.640
I'm walking too far ahead, you're calling to me

02:16.640 --> 02:22.640
I can't hear what you said, can you see

02:22.640 --> 02:28.640
Go slow, and I fall behind

02:28.640 --> 02:31.640
And a second hand unwinds if lost

02:31.640 --> 02:35.640
You can look and you will find it

02:35.640 --> 02:38.640
And I love the time

02:38.640 --> 02:40.640
If you fall I will catch you

02:40.640 --> 02:42.640
I'll be with you

02:42.640 --> 02:45.640
Time after time

02:53.640 --> 03:00.640
After my picture phase and darkness has turned to grey

03:00.640 --> 03:07.640
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm okay

03:07.640 --> 03:15.640
Secrets stolen, deep inside, ape inside

03:15.640 --> 03:18.640
The drum beats out of time

03:18.640 --> 03:25.640
Plus you can run and you will find it, time after time

03:25.640 --> 03:32.640
If you fall I will catch you, I'll be with you, time after time

03:32.640 --> 03:36.640
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me

03:36.640 --> 03:39.640
Time after time

03:39.640 --> 03:44.640
If we fall, I will catch you while we wait

03:44.640 --> 03:47.640
Time after time

04:17.640 --> 04:45.640
Call it it to me

Tag's done.

17:59.040 --> 18:05.200
hey guys we're back here with more orange lounge radio starting off in our

18:05.200 --> 18:10.040
brand new studio we picked up and moved the things from Folsom and now we are in

18:10.040 --> 18:13.280
a town called Rancho Cordova it's all still Sacramento so you know for those

18:13.280 --> 18:16.060
you guys are curious where we're at we're just moved down the freeway a

18:16.060 --> 18:20.920
little bit that's all so and I apologize because our audio levels are a little

18:20.920 --> 18:26.000
bit screwy tonight and I really don't know the best way to fix them so we're

18:26.000 --> 18:29.840
just gonna kind of adjust them as we go along tonight because I know it sounds a

18:29.840 --> 18:34.100
little weird I think I sound very amplified I don't know you want it you

18:34.100 --> 18:39.620
want always amped up I know Jamie sounds great I always sound great I don't know

18:39.620 --> 18:42.940
maybe it's just the mics we kind of played mic roulette to a little bit to

18:42.940 --> 18:46.420
try and bring some quiet people up and some loud people down but now I'm like

18:46.420 --> 18:51.800
too loud it's weird I don't know anyway turn yourself down where which one am I

18:51.800 --> 18:56.020
I don't even know which one I hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Oops

18:57.500 --> 19:03.960
This is awesome radio. I know that check check. Okay, fine. You're listening to mic check radio

19:04.920 --> 19:06.560
Yeah

19:06.560 --> 19:12.320
Imagine that that we got nominated for that live 365 award thing two of them and the award show

19:12.840 --> 19:14.840
The award show was last night

19:14.840 --> 19:23.360
what Ultraman stop distracting me over there so we're nominated for two best of

19:23.360 --> 19:27.160
life these five awards so we went to the little shindig they had last night and I

19:27.160 --> 19:32.320
think we I think we looked pretty hot I gotta say we were certainly unique no

19:32.320 --> 19:41.800
that's very drunk all these random people keep coming in here hi um is that

19:41.800 --> 19:49.880
Anyway we're trying to do radio. I'm just gonna close my eyes so I can't see

19:49.880 --> 19:54.760
people keep coming into the studio. The best of the Y365 awards were last night.

19:54.760 --> 19:59.720
We went to the shindig. We didn't win but that's okay. We're cool with it because

19:59.720 --> 20:04.600
you know when we when we looked at the chat room because they actually had the

20:04.600 --> 20:08.480
chat room being projected on the nearby wall so we could see the chat and see

20:08.480 --> 20:11.520
people talking about you know the awards and stuff. When we looked in the chat

20:11.520 --> 20:16.720
room there was like six or seven people yelling like just screaming little fan

20:16.720 --> 20:20.680
boys and fangirls and that was so cool to see so I really appreciate you guys

20:20.680 --> 20:26.400
that joined us there in spirit last night and were yelling things probably

20:26.400 --> 20:30.120
offending other broadcasters but that's okay some of them need their feathers

20:30.120 --> 20:33.800
ruffled a little bit honestly but actually we met some very cool people

20:33.800 --> 20:37.960
we met some very awesome other broadcasters I sure did so we were very

20:37.960 --> 20:42.220
happy about that and then we also met some well we didn't really meet them but

20:42.220 --> 20:46.100
we also saw some people that were kind of kind of jerks and we had no idea how

20:46.100 --> 20:51.780
they were winning awards but that's all right that's the nature of the business

20:51.780 --> 20:57.300
them's the breaks so we had those and we will break them in the future so we had

20:57.300 --> 21:01.000
a good time and thanks you guys for getting us nominated even though we

21:01.000 --> 21:05.620
didn't win it was still cool and we'll just try again next year all right um

21:05.620 --> 21:11.340
also we're famous to anybody who saw us in the paper here recently and is tuning

21:11.340 --> 21:15.140
in because of it welcome I swear our shows are usually not this disorganized

21:15.140 --> 21:18.980
but it's interesting because the article that ran in the Sacramento Bee which is

21:18.980 --> 21:22.620
our local paper pretty big paper around here it talks about how we do the show

21:22.620 --> 21:26.760
every week in our Folsom apartment but when they interviewed us it was like

21:26.760 --> 21:31.300
five weeks ago or so it was a little while ago so we've moved since then so

21:31.300 --> 21:34.580
we've had been dealing with all that so we're not actually in Folsom anymore

21:34.580 --> 21:39.700
We're still in the Sacramento area, but the story was very nice. It's a very lovely article. What'd you guys think? I?

21:40.220 --> 21:41.700
Thought it was nice

21:41.700 --> 21:47.060
It was nice. That's what was bigger than everything sort of in the shot

21:47.580 --> 21:52.560
Your foot was very beautiful for those of you guys who haven't seen it yet. They put a giant picture

21:52.560 --> 21:58.160
It's on the front page of the scene section, which is you know, like the I guess entertainment what's going on around town

21:58.160 --> 22:04.160
Second front page huge picture that takes up like a quarter of the page. It's huge. It's Matt's foot

22:04.760 --> 22:10.640
With me and Jamie looking on in the background. It's just this ginormous foot. It looks like a Monty Python sketch seriously

22:11.680 --> 22:12.840
so

22:12.840 --> 22:17.020
Matt was very elated to see that picture and show all his friends look my foot

22:17.720 --> 22:21.160
Yeah, I just added to the excitement of this entire weekend. Yay

22:21.680 --> 22:26.320
He was the first comment on my live show. He's like, I love how the only picture of me is both my foot

22:26.320 --> 22:31.720
I started laughing that was funny I think it would have been cool if they

22:31.720 --> 22:36.360
had actually put a picture that had a minute but yeah that would have been

22:36.360 --> 22:41.620
nice but no that's never gonna happen all right well what we're gonna do now

22:41.620 --> 22:44.800
we're gonna start the show so usually do although we got some tangents there

22:44.800 --> 22:46.720
that's all right I just want to talk about those things real quick we're

22:46.720 --> 22:49.960
going to be doing a little bit of how is your week how is your day where we go

22:49.960 --> 22:53.640
around and find out what's going on in people's lives so and I know everybody's

22:53.640 --> 22:58.780
got a lot to say. We weren't live last week, we were taped, we still had a new show, um,

22:58.780 --> 23:01.700
and I hope you guys are tuning in, because there were two cage matches to vote on last

23:01.700 --> 23:06.220
week, and we're gonna talk about the winners of those very shortly. Um, but first, a little

23:06.220 --> 23:09.580
chance to catch up on the past two weeks, and your day. So start off with the lovely

23:09.580 --> 23:15.940
Dark Sakura. My week was complete and utter shit. And when I say complete and utter shit,

23:15.940 --> 23:19.160
the only way it could have been worse is if a house fell on my car, which I expected it

23:19.160 --> 23:25.760
to do on Friday. Wednesday I actually got up in a really good mood and I was all happy.

23:25.760 --> 23:30.960
Go out and my trunk is open and my window is rolled down. They stole the CD player out

23:30.960 --> 23:35.900
of my car, the fuckers, including a really good Gorillaz compilation CD that I put together

23:35.900 --> 23:40.640
to listen to in my car. But they didn't take anything else, which I should be grateful

23:40.640 --> 23:47.160
for because my Bond CD was in my car too. But it just, you know, it was sort of like

23:47.160 --> 23:50.240
the icing on the cake for me that day I was stressed out for school and I

23:50.240 --> 23:54.320
finally just ended up staying home that day because I was too stressed. Next day

23:54.320 --> 24:01.680
I get in my car I'm driving to work and this guy driving a taxi van pulls out in

24:01.680 --> 24:09.680
front of me and I run into him. I have pretty bad muscle contusion which in

24:09.680 --> 24:15.800
like normal people's terms is a big bad bruise around my hip and a pinched nerve

24:15.800 --> 24:22.800
And now I'm on Vicodin, Flexeril, and 800mg of Ibuprofen and lots of alcohol to make me

24:22.800 --> 24:26.480
feel better.

24:26.480 --> 24:31.080
I still need to find out, because it's totally not my fault, but I need to get the guy's

24:31.080 --> 24:33.720
insurance company to pay for the damages to my car.

24:33.720 --> 24:36.240
I can't drive my car.

24:36.240 --> 24:40.000
We can probably hammer the fender back into some kind of shape that I can drive it in

24:40.000 --> 24:42.480
now, although my alignment is a little bit off.

24:42.480 --> 24:46.160
but it's not undriveable except the fact that the fender keeps rubbing against my right

24:46.160 --> 24:47.160
tire.

24:47.160 --> 24:52.240
Um, nobody was hurt, um, well, I was hurt, but the other guy was nice too, so I don't

24:52.240 --> 24:57.360
want to hear anyone saying, oh, well that fucker this, or, you know, fuck him, because

24:57.360 --> 24:58.360
he was a nice guy.

24:58.360 --> 25:01.000
He really was, and I feel bad for him too.

25:01.000 --> 25:04.800
Oh, thank you, I got a yea from me being on Vicodin again.

25:04.800 --> 25:08.880
I do actually do pretty damn good writing when I'm on Vicodin, so maybe I'll start writing

25:08.880 --> 25:19.240
again um and then it was just a whole bunch of just different crap but it's

25:19.240 --> 25:24.320
been a really weird weekend because I got made a moderator on the gorillas

25:24.320 --> 25:30.640
unofficial board which is one of the big ones there run by a really cool crew

25:30.640 --> 25:41.760
there I also we went to the live 365 awards and where we were gonna go over

25:41.760 --> 25:47.160
that later I won something on the list a little bingo thing that they did I'll go

25:47.160 --> 25:53.380
over that later too and something else good happened but for the life of me I

25:53.380 --> 25:57.440
can't remember what it is it's like I can't remember my life anymore unless I

25:57.440 --> 26:03.320
read my damn live journal other than that though it's been I've been a weird

26:03.320 --> 26:07.120
combination of either going from incredibly elated to just super

26:07.120 --> 26:14.840
depressed over everything so if I'm in a weird mood blame the Vicodin all right

26:14.840 --> 26:22.160
yeah and I didn't play anything okay let's go over to Loki how was your week

26:22.160 --> 26:29.860
how was your day dare I ask well this last three weeks have sucked it's been

26:29.860 --> 26:34.820
just busy I haven't actually had time to rest my new jobs just stressful as hell

26:34.820 --> 26:44.180
and I'm just tired yesterday I drove 200 miles to the San Francisco today I drove

26:44.180 --> 26:51.260
200 miles to Oakland Oakland and mind you this was about seven hours after I

26:51.260 --> 26:55.020
I drove to San Francisco and back.

26:55.020 --> 27:02.120
So I got back today and I'm tired and just I'm hungry because I haven't eaten that much

27:02.120 --> 27:09.540
today and yesterday and it just sucks and then this week is going to suck more.

27:09.540 --> 27:14.940
Just one big huge thing of suckage and then Comcast decided, you know, hey we're not going

27:14.940 --> 27:18.940
to hook up the cable right and then, you know, that didn't work all week so I couldn't actually

27:18.940 --> 27:24.280
play final fantasy 11 or anything that sucked so I can get back to that finally

27:24.280 --> 27:33.260
and then what else no not really much of anything then Jonas didn't show up with

27:33.260 --> 27:37.860
food yeah he was gonna come tonight and bring food he's probably the only person

27:37.860 --> 27:41.860
in town that didn't show up tonight that's all right though you know if you

27:41.860 --> 27:46.900
make a commitment to bring food god damn it you better show up because I count on

27:46.900 --> 27:53.500
this food no I don't know so yeah that it sucked today I got to hang out with

27:53.500 --> 27:58.700
Nellie's grandparents who can't speak any English in fact they go we can't

27:58.700 --> 28:03.100
speak English and English are the first thing they said to me so they okay and

28:03.100 --> 28:06.980
they're all you can't speak English and because they didn't know how to say you

28:06.980 --> 28:13.700
know can't can you speak Russian so they like you can't or can you speak English

28:13.700 --> 28:18.980
and then she kind of like shook her head like no that's alright no like ah wrong

28:18.980 --> 28:30.460
words yeah and then she was interesting Tetris no that's not the international

28:30.460 --> 28:35.220
it's the international game of peace didn't you know you should have whipped

28:35.220 --> 28:40.960
out your copy of Tetris and been all do you understand Tetris no instead I

28:40.960 --> 28:47.040
I played Ridge Racer and it's getting goddamn hard now, since I, once you beat, um, um,

28:47.040 --> 28:52.320
Pro Circuit, um, 18, that's pretty much the actual official end of the game, and then

28:52.320 --> 28:59.200
from there on it's all really hard shit. So I got the Beat the Devil car today. That sucked,

28:59.200 --> 29:04.760
because it just uses nitros constantly, but I rock and I beat it four times, so I eventually

29:04.760 --> 29:10.260
got that. Then I unlocked the Super Rally X car, which is all pixelated. It has blocky

29:10.260 --> 29:14.940
wheels that's funny so I got that too that was fun we have a comment from the

29:14.940 --> 29:20.560
chat room www www.orangelandtrader.com click on chat legend is that who says

29:20.560 --> 29:26.500
Loki I dare you to take some of Jamie's Vicodin I can't swallow pills so no I

29:26.500 --> 29:31.620
don't think Jamie would give any of it up anyway oh she is she shouting no for

29:31.620 --> 29:35.820
the bathroom I don't like fucking pills I'm fine I don't have a headache I'm

29:35.820 --> 29:41.420
just starving so I'll eat some later I thought about stuff because honestly

29:41.420 --> 29:47.260
before we came here okay I got back at my house at about 530 okay I said to

29:47.260 --> 29:52.460
myself because I was exhausted you know after driving all day and just it just

29:52.460 --> 29:56.900
sucked so I laid down like I'm just gonna lay down for a second my mom

29:56.900 --> 30:01.980
calls me at like 615 says hey yeah she's trying to talk to me about the

30:01.980 --> 30:06.900
a newspaper article because I left a message for her. I'm like, aw shit, I gotta go. I'm

30:06.900 --> 30:12.500
supposed to be at the show already. Damn it. So then I get here, I have to park way the

30:12.500 --> 30:16.700
fuck down the road, and for some reason I thought Rob's apartment number was like something

30:16.700 --> 30:21.220
else than it was, so I'm walking around going, where the fuck is it? All these goddamn buildings

30:21.220 --> 30:27.140
look the same! Aw, this sucks! So then I walk down to the end, I'm like, okay, count the

30:27.140 --> 30:36.300
buildings that okay here you go here you go and then so yeah but that's not I'm

30:36.300 --> 30:41.340
just tired I'm really tired you know it we'll get into that all later you know

30:41.340 --> 30:46.020
about all the wonderful things that you encounter while driving long distances

30:46.020 --> 30:53.140
mainly bad drivers yeah all that to come later on lovely all right who else is in

30:53.140 --> 30:56.540
here let's go over to Arcadian 42 who joined us snuck in there a little bit

30:56.540 --> 30:58.540
How was your week? How was your day sir?

30:58.780 --> 31:03.880
Last week we went to Jamie's party. That was last Saturday. It's pretty fun to go down there and

31:04.380 --> 31:06.180
to

31:06.180 --> 31:08.020
MGL and

31:08.020 --> 31:14.060
Dave and Buster's they didn't go till since last year played games and stuff like that. Most of the week was just work

31:15.020 --> 31:19.420
getting the prepared for their boss to go to Europe for three weeks and

31:20.500 --> 31:22.500
So that was that

31:22.500 --> 31:28.500
Other than that, on Friday I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a pretty good movie.

31:28.500 --> 31:38.500
That was a very good adaptation of the books. Sort of draws from all of the books, but mostly, of course, Paul is the first one.

31:38.500 --> 31:44.500
And then yesterday he didn't do much, and today he didn't do much, and he came here.

31:44.500 --> 31:50.500
Alright, let's go over to Ice Queen, if he can take a minute away from PictoChat. How was your week, how was your day?

31:50.500 --> 31:54.580
Oh, it was just wonderfully entertaining.

31:54.580 --> 31:58.140
Actually the past three weeks have been, you know, pretty much wonderfully entertaining.

31:58.140 --> 32:02.900
I have, in the last three weeks, spent over $1,000 on my truck, that piece of shit that

32:02.900 --> 32:06.260
has no grill, whatever you call it, on the front.

32:06.260 --> 32:09.780
So you look at the front of the truck and you see the radiator, which is absolutely

32:09.780 --> 32:11.340
lovely.

32:11.340 --> 32:17.420
After that, I pretty much just have been working, lovely new job.

32:17.420 --> 32:23.340
I'm a paper pusher for $10 an hour, woohoo.

32:23.340 --> 32:26.140
Other than that, not much, oh yeah.

32:26.140 --> 32:28.620
I decided to try to get clever with my computer.

32:28.620 --> 32:34.080
It's had some viruses on there that aren't being detected and fixed by the Norton Antivirus.

32:34.080 --> 32:41.680
So I went in there on Friday night and followed an online chat, or an online FAQ regarding

32:41.680 --> 32:46.820
how to fix this specific virus, the ISASS.EXE.

32:46.820 --> 32:54.160
And not knowing any better, the fact told me that I should go ahead and go into the

32:54.160 --> 33:00.740
safe mode, under administrator, and change the permissions for the user to deny.

33:00.740 --> 33:06.060
Well, me not being any more aware than I was, I went ahead and did that, which then locked

33:06.060 --> 33:14.220
up all of my Windows files, no longer had access to explorer.exe as the process, so

33:14.220 --> 33:20.740
So I have no desktop, had no start menu, and I had no access to the MS Config feature,

33:20.740 --> 33:23.100
which would not allow me to go back in and change my permissions.

33:23.100 --> 33:27.940
So I spent the whole weekend pretty much just going through my computer.

33:27.940 --> 33:31.100
Neil, you are a dork.

33:31.100 --> 33:36.580
Anyway, I went through and actually Neil helped me out quite a bit.

33:36.580 --> 33:37.580
Did most of the work.

33:37.580 --> 33:40.860
He went in, added the software back in there and got everything working again.

33:40.860 --> 33:46.860
So now I'm just waiting on the operating system to load back up, and hopefully I'll have my computer.

33:46.860 --> 33:51.860
Oh, and yeah, World of Warcraft, I started playing that. That game rocks.

33:51.860 --> 33:57.860
It's better than Final Fantasy XI, only because you can actually solo and not have to worry about it.

33:57.860 --> 34:01.860
So yes, it does. Brett said that doesn't make a game better? Oh, it does.

34:01.860 --> 34:03.860
I am antisocial, I hate people.

34:03.860 --> 34:05.860
I'm still waiting for Ragnarok 2.

34:05.860 --> 34:06.860
I'd rather build things up on my own, thank you.

34:06.860 --> 34:11.280
Then it makes the game more suited for you, but other people like to play multiplayer

34:11.600 --> 34:16.800
With the only games suited for antisocial people are those that are offline. Oh

34:18.200 --> 34:20.200
You mean just all other video games. Yes

34:20.720 --> 34:25.960
Okay, you can play Ragnarok online completely antisocial because I leveled myself into the 80s. Yeah by myself

34:25.960 --> 34:30.160
Oh that Ragnarok online is the ultimate solo world online RPG

34:30.160 --> 34:38.160
I don't know, actually this Guild Wars game everybody's been talking about sounds like a very solo-friendly game.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.160
Blue Burst Beta will be out in a few weeks.

34:40.160 --> 34:43.160
But do we get to play Blue Burst?

34:43.160 --> 34:45.160
No, no, US Beta.

34:45.160 --> 34:47.160
Do we have to pay monthly fees to play it?

34:47.160 --> 34:48.160
Not for the Beta.

34:48.160 --> 34:51.160
Oh, okay. Well, anyway.

34:51.160 --> 34:56.160
What are you doing? You said you're playing as DS and you should be doing a radio show.

34:56.160 --> 35:01.160
I wanted to join the Picto chat orgy so shoot me. Hey, don't go anywhere. How was your week? How was your day? Thank you, Stow.

35:02.160 --> 35:07.160
Oh, fabulous. Um, no, it's been kind of sucky.

35:08.160 --> 35:18.160
We have, uh, me and, uh, the Rice Princess are, both have jobs now and, uh, it's kind of hard to, when you only have one vehicle, to get everybody where they need to go.

35:18.160 --> 35:20.220
So we've been looking for a car and every single time we go

35:20.660 --> 35:22.020
To go check out a car

35:22.020 --> 35:27.460
It is apparent within a few minutes that the people do not know what they're talking about and do not know how to take care

35:27.460 --> 35:29.460
of their vehicles, so

35:29.920 --> 35:31.460
Yeah

35:31.460 --> 35:36.280
So far no luck. So pretty shitty. Oh, I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide also today

35:36.280 --> 35:39.500
We did we both went and saw it and it was good liked it

35:39.500 --> 35:44.180
So yeah, I think it's a sci-fi movie for even non sci-fi fans

35:44.180 --> 35:50.020
like even they would like it my favorite part and it's a big spoiler I feel like

35:50.020 --> 35:55.860
a soap I think I'm a sofa uh-huh that one's pretty funny but I love the whale

35:55.860 --> 36:03.580
yes yes the whale it's not a spoiler I doubt anybody like not many many people

36:03.580 --> 36:09.660
have read this book it's kind of a cult thing yeah bunch of people's redhead

36:09.660 --> 36:17.660
Yeah, like, but, when you say a bunch of people have read it, it's like, nothing compared to how many people have read the Bible.

36:17.660 --> 36:29.660
You know, just because a few thousand people here and there have read a book, that may be more than I have ever met in my life, but hey, it's, yeah, it's not a huge thing, so, whatever.

36:29.660 --> 36:37.660
I just wanted to share with the chatroom that they're not the only ones who feel like they have not seen the movie because I have not seen the movie, so don't feel too left out, you guys.

36:37.660 --> 36:42.460
you guys. I'll see it eventually. Did you see Kung Fu Hustle? Oh my god! Go see Kung

36:42.460 --> 36:47.140
Fu Hustle now! Honestly, if I had to choose between movies to see, and then when I went

36:47.140 --> 36:51.100
and saw The Hitchhiker's Guide, I would have rather seen Kung Fu Hustle. Just because-

36:51.100 --> 36:54.740
You haven't seen it? No, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle yet, but I saw Hitchhiker's Guide

36:54.740 --> 37:00.260
and then, oh, Kung Fu Hustle is friggin' awesome. You know what I want to see? What I would

37:00.260 --> 37:04.820
like to see is not paying $10 to go to a goddamn movie. That's what I would like to see. I

37:04.820 --> 37:11.820
Like, you need to do that. You just go find the attractive looking gay guy at the movie theater place and just say, hey.

37:11.820 --> 37:18.820
Yeah, because that's the universal mating call, you know. It's, hey. What the fuck is wrong with you?

37:18.820 --> 37:24.820
Anyway, my week and my date, just been very busy with all the moving stuff that's going on.

37:24.820 --> 37:32.820
What more can be said? I'm just so busy, but I'm so happy to have it all done.

37:32.820 --> 37:36.340
and I'm finally moved in here and I'm getting comfortable in here and all that

37:36.340 --> 37:40.700
and finally things will settle down and then e3 is just around the corner and

37:40.700 --> 37:44.300
then we get to go into panic mode again so that should be exciting we'll see

37:44.300 --> 37:50.260
what happens all right anyway what we're gonna do now and I'm I'm still adjusting

37:50.260 --> 37:55.540
the sound levels kind of as we go along here so I apologize is this my mic here

37:55.540 --> 38:00.780
I don't know maybe you should figure that out I don't know I'm so lost all

38:00.780 --> 38:05.620
Alright, anyway, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going

38:05.620 --> 38:09.100
to play some new popin' music during this break.

38:09.100 --> 38:10.100
It's brand new.

38:10.100 --> 38:11.580
We haven't played this on the station yet.

38:11.580 --> 38:17.940
It's Popin' Music 12, although it's really Popin' Music Iroha, but it's just frickin'

38:17.940 --> 38:19.060
Popin' Music 12.

38:19.060 --> 38:22.100
They're just trying to give it new names so that you'll forget that there's so damn many

38:22.100 --> 38:23.100
of these games.

38:23.100 --> 38:24.100
Like 2DX?

38:24.100 --> 38:25.100
Yeah.

38:25.100 --> 38:28.140
But there's a lot of good music in this one.

38:28.140 --> 38:31.420
off with a remix of Star Mine. It's pretty interesting, so I'm gonna start

38:31.420 --> 38:36.020
off with that. Also in this, you're gonna hear some new Akira Yamaoka, a remix of

38:36.020 --> 38:40.220
the theme from Goemon is in here, and then the new Good Cool song is in here

38:40.220 --> 38:43.980
as well. So we're gonna hear all that during this break, and we'll be back with

38:43.980 --> 38:50.980
more Orange Lounge Radio!

39:43.980 --> 39:45.980
One, two, three, four!

40:13.980 --> 40:15.980

I used to shake it, you used to screw me, we used to dive into the light.

44:37.660 --> 44:44.660
You're just a shaking, you're just a grooving, we're just a shining silver line

44:44.660 --> 44:49.660
Kie kaketa naku no ki wo kurau

44:49.660 --> 44:51.660
Love is sweet as

Sayou ga oshi e te kureru

44:58.660 --> 45:01.660
Omoite mano se naku re ni

45:01.660 --> 45:05.660
Watsu e mona wo shinai yori

45:35.660 --> 45:39.660
Just a-shakin', just a-groovin', just a-divin' to the life

45:54.660 --> 45:58.660
Jumpin', jumpin', rushin' down all around, everybody get up, you can't get down, no

45:58.660 --> 46:05.660
I am so shaking, you're just a prune, we have to start each other's lives

46:05.660 --> 46:09.660
I'm just a-shakin', you're on the prowlin' heart

46:09.660 --> 46:13.660
It's just fine, it's just fine

46:39.660 --> 46:50.900
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140, and we're in our brand new studio.

46:50.900 --> 46:54.020
It's kind of interesting because it's a little bit smaller than what we were dealing with

46:54.020 --> 46:57.980
before, but, you know, that's the way things go sometimes.

46:57.980 --> 46:58.980
Yeah?

46:58.980 --> 47:02.780
Oh, it's just a throwback to when the show first started.

47:02.780 --> 47:03.780
Kind of.

47:03.780 --> 47:06.580
It's a throwback to studio number one, which we were in for about the first, what, 50 episodes

47:06.580 --> 47:07.580
or so?

47:07.580 --> 47:09.580
I've got a much comfier chair.

47:09.580 --> 47:14.460
Did you notice, by the way, we actually put the big, green, comfy chair in here just for

47:14.460 --> 47:15.460
you, Darkstalker?

47:15.460 --> 47:16.460
Yes, and I appreciate it.

47:16.460 --> 47:17.460
Thank you very much.

47:17.460 --> 47:18.460
No problem.

47:18.460 --> 47:20.960
It was a bitch moving it in here, although, really, all I did was yell at, you know, Brad

47:20.960 --> 47:25.100
and Bugs, too, you know, move this way, no, no, don't hit the wall, don't do it.

47:25.100 --> 47:27.380
I greatly appreciate the presence of the chair in here.

47:27.380 --> 47:28.380
It's nice.

47:28.380 --> 47:31.180
And then, behind Darkstalker, now, she doesn't let us put her on the webcam, so we can't

47:31.180 --> 47:34.420
really show you, but maybe we'll take a picture or something later, but you can see the Jay

47:34.420 --> 47:37.860
and Silent Bob Strike Back poster that says, all you motherfuckers are gonna pay, you are

47:37.860 --> 47:39.020
the ones who are the bollikers.

47:39.020 --> 47:42.700
We have that right behind Jamie's chair, appropriately enough, I think, for her.

47:42.700 --> 47:44.940
You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

47:44.940 --> 47:45.940
Thank you.

47:45.940 --> 47:50.100
Anyway, um, so during the break there we were listening to some music from, uh, the new

47:50.100 --> 47:51.100
pop music, Yeroha.

47:51.100 --> 47:52.100
What do you guys think?

47:52.100 --> 47:53.100
Dark Sucker.

47:53.100 --> 47:54.100
It sucked.

47:54.100 --> 47:55.100
It sucked.

47:55.100 --> 47:56.100
Very ass-worthy.

47:56.100 --> 47:59.900
The Star Mine remake, you guys didn't like it?

47:59.900 --> 48:02.140
I thought it was cute.

48:02.140 --> 48:04.500
I don't think it's that bad.

48:04.500 --> 48:05.500
I didn't hear the Star Mine one.

48:05.500 --> 48:06.500
I only saw the Go-Emon one.

48:06.500 --> 48:07.500
What?

48:07.500 --> 48:08.500
The Go-Emon one.

48:08.500 --> 48:13.500
I didn't hear it, but what was it playing?

48:13.500 --> 48:18.500
Did it say Honey?

48:18.500 --> 48:20.500
No, it's the other one, not Ryusei Honey.

48:20.500 --> 48:22.500
Oh, the rock one.

48:22.500 --> 48:23.500
Yeah, the rock one.

48:23.500 --> 48:26.500
That is my least favorite Kiryamuka track ever, so don't ask.

48:26.500 --> 48:29.500
I enjoy it more than 250 BPM, that's for damn sure.

48:29.500 --> 48:34.500
Strangely enough, 250 BPM has warmed on me. I like it now. I hate that, whatever that new song is, sorry.

48:34.500 --> 48:40.460
Sorry, I can't stand 250 BPM and I hate the crack baby in the video, too. I've always hated that so

48:45.100 --> 48:48.340
Somebody hold a towel over the video and then I could pass it

48:49.100 --> 48:53.560
If you do if it does sound like our audio levels are being fucked with don't adjust your settings

48:53.560 --> 48:54.500
There's nothing you guys are doing

48:54.500 --> 48:57.860
We are fucking with our audio to try and get the sound that we used to have in the old studio

48:57.980 --> 49:00.760
Because like when I have the headphones on it's really bugging the hell out of me

49:00.760 --> 49:02.760
So I have Loki our tech expert

49:03.280 --> 49:07.520
Gauging the audio right now, so he's sitting there listening carefully and trained little knobs

49:07.520 --> 49:11.760
So you can tell we were very well prepared for tonight's show, but what can I say?

49:11.760 --> 49:14.760
I had to go see the Lion King today, so I had no time to prepare because you know

49:15.160 --> 49:17.160
It's not every day you get to go see the Lion King

49:20.560 --> 49:22.560
Yeah, well unless you're in the play

49:22.840 --> 49:25.640
Yeah, unless you're in the play. I think it's bugging the hell out of you

49:25.640 --> 49:29.960
Just because you could actually hear your voice now, and it's different, and I don't like different things

49:29.960 --> 49:35.400
that's my problem hey you you're different get out let's beat him up he's

49:35.400 --> 49:42.680
different all right you're not wearing a silly hat so while we were talking about

49:42.680 --> 49:45.600
games hey oh I thought you were leaving I'm like don't worry yet because I want

49:45.600 --> 49:49.000
to ask you about guitar freaks and drum mania V because you got a chance you

49:49.000 --> 49:53.880
said you played drum mania V or guitar freaks V all right tell it because I

49:53.880 --> 49:58.720
haven't played either one I saw drum mania V at MGL when I went over there

49:58.720 --> 50:01.320
for Dark Chakra's birthday which I want to talk about your birthday party a little more

50:01.320 --> 50:05.400
in detail than we got into earlier. But we went over to Milpitas Golf Land to play and

50:05.400 --> 50:09.200
I saw Drumania V and I was like hey it's Drumania and I fucking suck at it so I'm gonna go over

50:09.200 --> 50:13.840
here to Guitar Freaks. I didn't even bother to check out V. So how is the V series? I

50:13.840 --> 50:18.680
haven't even really looked at it. Well I only really got one play in because I was running

50:18.680 --> 50:22.720
low on time there so I only got one play at Guitar Freaks V. They didn't have Drumania

50:22.720 --> 50:29.940
via our golf land up here in Roseville. So, that's unfortunate. I prefer Drummania over

50:29.940 --> 50:35.060
Guitar Freaks. So whatever, I gotta play one game of Guitar Freaks V. The song selection,

50:35.060 --> 50:43.020
I think, is better than some of the previous ones. To me, after Guitar Freaks V, the song

50:43.020 --> 50:50.980
selection has kind of gone downhill. I mean, when they got rid of, was it, frickin' Spring.

50:50.980 --> 50:52.980
Hotter Spring

51:20.980 --> 51:26.980
So it's not really a very interesting new addition or useful addition.

51:26.980 --> 51:30.980
Other than that, it seems like it's pretty much just the same old Guitar Freaks.

51:30.980 --> 51:35.980
It looks like the resolution looks higher, it looks more clear.

51:35.980 --> 51:38.980
So you're looking at the notes look like they scroll smoother.

51:38.980 --> 51:45.980
It's like the fifth mix of Guitar Freaks basically, like GGR fifth mix, how they added that.

51:45.980 --> 51:51.980
I mean, but other than that, it's no real big woo-ha, wow, awesome new Guitar Freaks, so...

51:51.980 --> 51:56.980
I'll have to go check out the Drummania V first before I can give my final answer,

51:56.980 --> 52:00.980
because I want to play a session. I haven't played a session in a long time, so...

52:00.980 --> 52:04.980
I know, what's up with that? Like, Golfland and all those places don't really have, like, the session mode like they used to,

52:04.980 --> 52:08.980
and the session was so cool when they had it, and now it's gone.

52:08.980 --> 52:13.980
Yeah, they really should get a Keyboardmania V to go with the Guitar Freaks Drummania,

52:13.980 --> 52:18.180
because the keyboard mania may not have been nearly as popular as the other games

52:18.180 --> 52:23.300
um it was fun to have the four-person session that was always good times I

52:23.300 --> 52:29.940
still want sax mania mania oh yeah or what was the axe freaks what was the

52:29.940 --> 52:35.860
other one if it's the head mania the pole that you just yeah anyway sax

52:35.860 --> 52:40.620
machine anyway uh Arkadia 42 I know you're big on the guitar freaks and

52:40.620 --> 52:46.620
So I'm curious, you at Milpitas Golf only got to check out Drawmania V, so I'm kind of curious what you thought.

52:46.620 --> 52:53.620
That's pretty much similar it seems. I didn't really notice the videos or anything just because I wasn't really looking at them.

52:53.620 --> 52:56.620
I was just looking through the song list. The song list seems pretty good.

52:56.620 --> 53:02.620
I noticed there was a lot of older songs that they brought back from various older mixes.

53:02.620 --> 53:06.900
like void and what was the other one I really noticed like

53:06.900 --> 53:11.140
oh crap I can't remember like wild ride which only showed up in one

53:11.140 --> 53:14.740
was like a special track in one of them that only showed up and that one was

53:14.740 --> 53:18.220
like seventh mix I think and

53:18.220 --> 53:22.620
yeah it seemed pretty good the way they do the song select

53:22.620 --> 53:25.740
only shows like five or six songs at a time it makes it harder to see what

53:25.740 --> 53:29.500
songs are in it so that was probably the bad thing about it but

53:29.500 --> 53:31.740
Otherwise, it seemed pretty cool.

53:31.740 --> 53:33.380
I'd have to play it more, because I only played it twice,

53:33.380 --> 53:37.100
and then we had to run off to Dave and Buster's.

53:37.100 --> 53:39.380
So I didn't get to have that much chance to play it, and I

53:39.380 --> 53:42.820
haven't been to Roseville Golf Land in like two months, so

53:42.820 --> 53:47.020
can't really comment on Guitar Freaks V yet.

53:47.020 --> 53:50.540
But yeah, seemed all right.

53:50.540 --> 53:52.940
You know what's interesting is that while you guys were

53:52.940 --> 53:55.820
checking out V, I was actually checking out 11th Mix of

53:55.820 --> 53:58.140
Guitar Freaks finally for the first time.

53:58.140 --> 53:58.980
And it's fun.

53:58.980 --> 54:03.680
It's very pink, but you know, I had a good time and I played it. So, you know, what can I say?

54:03.680 --> 54:06.180
Did you check out any of those to go traffic?

54:06.180 --> 54:12.580
You mean yeah, you might beat me in the final. Yeah, was that the first time you check that out? No. Oh, okay

54:12.860 --> 54:14.060
You know one game though

54:14.060 --> 54:18.140
I want to kind of transition to this topic because I there was another game you got to check out for the first time

54:19.260 --> 54:22.380
Tell us about it. I played the retard game. I mean in the groove

54:23.380 --> 54:25.700
It's no holds barred from you apparently

54:25.700 --> 54:34.700
It has good music. Everything else about it was utter and complete ripoff. I also don't like that you can't go backwards in the menus.

54:34.700 --> 54:48.700
I realized that for the first time as well the other day when I fucked one of my modifiers severely. I could not go back. Unless there's a way you do it differently than DDR, but I figured everything else was the same as DDR. So the way you would move back would be the same and it doesn't work.

54:48.700 --> 54:49.700
It was just really stupid.

54:49.700 --> 54:52.700
Guess how you go back, you fail your first song and put more coins in.

54:54.700 --> 54:57.700
What an ingenious idea, how to make more money.

54:57.700 --> 55:00.700
It really wasn't that much of an... it wasn't really an innovation at all.

55:00.700 --> 55:04.700
And the songs were longer, which in some cases was okay.

55:04.700 --> 55:08.700
But overall, the steps were awful. I mean, really awful.

55:08.700 --> 55:10.700
It felt like playing like a Korean mix.

55:13.700 --> 55:18.700
There were some good steps in Korean third, but I'm talking about how many jumps there were and everything.

55:18.700 --> 55:26.700
which I really hate doing, and it just, you know, it was like playing, like, um, like, uh, Konami of Hawaii's steps.

55:26.700 --> 55:29.700
That's how it was.

55:29.700 --> 55:32.700
That's a bad inside reference.

55:32.700 --> 55:35.700
So, but you don't mean, like, UltraMix 2 steps, because those...

55:35.700 --> 55:37.700
I mean, like, Konami's.

55:37.700 --> 55:43.700
Oh, or like, um, uh, service, or, I keep saying services, song packs one through six.

55:43.700 --> 55:45.700
Yes, like playing those.

55:45.700 --> 55:52.700
Okay. I keep saying service pack. I always say service pack because I get it confused with Microsoft. Song packs one through six then.

55:52.700 --> 55:57.700
Yeah. That's how, that's, it was Konami of Hawaii steps.

55:57.700 --> 56:04.700
You know, I've actually played In the Groove probably two times, at least two times this week if not three. I don't know, I've lost count.

56:04.700 --> 56:13.400
I'm warming up to it a little more but I don't know so I still I'm like I feel

56:13.400 --> 56:17.860
like this is just something to hold me over until the real thing is back I feel

56:17.860 --> 56:22.580
like I've gone from regular soda to diet soda and I'm still trying to get used to

56:22.580 --> 56:27.660
that nasty aftertaste that you get from diet soda that's kind of how it is and

56:27.660 --> 56:31.100
like I'm like you know as soon as they come out with a new flavor of soda I'm

56:31.100 --> 56:36.780
gonna go right back to it that's how I feel about this whole thing once they

56:36.780 --> 56:42.700
put the cocaine back in the coca-cola you'll be very rare to go you'll need

56:42.700 --> 56:45.280
the diet because the cocaine will take care of that for you well so here's the

56:45.280 --> 56:49.100
interesting thing what do you think it's going to be like on PlayStation 2 I

56:49.100 --> 56:52.980
haven't put much thought into it it's not like I'm gonna waste my money on it

56:52.980 --> 56:55.780
well here's the issue you might want to start thinking about it because guess

56:55.780 --> 56:57.940
where we're going on Wednesday, you and I.

56:57.940 --> 57:00.540
That's true, there's that.

57:00.540 --> 57:05.220
Somehow, we have managed to get an invite to the In The

57:05.220 --> 57:08.140
Group premiere party in San Francisco.

57:08.140 --> 57:10.620
So we're going to go check out the In The Group on

57:10.620 --> 57:13.220
PlayStation 2, and here's the great thing.

57:13.220 --> 57:15.340
The invite said, no, I haven't told you this.

57:15.340 --> 57:17.740
I was waiting for the show to tell you this, specifically on

57:17.740 --> 57:20.380
the show, free drinks.

57:20.380 --> 57:23.100
Oh, cool, liquor.

57:23.100 --> 57:26.700
Now what I'm curious about is what if for every drink you

57:26.700 --> 57:30.340
have to say something nice about In The Groove?

57:30.340 --> 57:31.900
Lame.

57:31.900 --> 57:33.860
I like this song.

57:33.860 --> 57:35.700
This song's cool too.

57:35.700 --> 57:37.220
It doesn't suck that much.

57:37.220 --> 57:40.900
I need to download this song.

57:40.900 --> 57:44.700
Which is interesting because my biggest problem with In The

57:44.700 --> 57:49.020
Groove is that half the songs don't do it for me.

57:49.020 --> 57:50.940
I'm not as big on the song list.

57:50.940 --> 57:52.940
I like the hip-hoppy ones, actually.

57:52.940 --> 57:56.940
See that? No, I guess that's where we differ, because I don't care for those tracks.

57:56.940 --> 57:58.940
The trance I can do without, because trance is...

57:58.940 --> 58:06.940
See, I actually like the really, like, stupid, uh, dance-y covers of, like, mouth and torn and all that stuff.

58:06.940 --> 58:12.940
I want innovation in music, and all trance is is rehashing. That's all it is.

58:12.940 --> 58:15.940
Let's add some synthesizer to it and call it music.

58:15.940 --> 58:21.060
here's the issue with trance is it's all just disco sped up with lots of

58:21.060 --> 58:26.900
synthesizers disco you know well there's a lot of dancing and involved in disco

58:26.900 --> 58:31.540
so I guess it works but there's just not a lot of talented trance artists out

58:31.540 --> 58:36.820
there you got to go to the very select few artists like one I'm really big on

58:36.820 --> 58:40.140
right now Yuzo Koshiro he does an awesome soundtrack for that one gun

58:40.140 --> 58:45.660
Midnight Maximum yeah just very few good artists will do trance well so most of

58:45.660 --> 58:48.900
time you're just gonna find shitty trance tracks if you're yeah like just

58:48.900 --> 58:54.180
badly fine on every single compilation out there yeah exactly and in to me that

58:54.180 --> 58:57.340
my favorite trance the songs that I think that are actually good trance

58:57.340 --> 59:01.140
songs are done by artists who don't technically they don't really do trance

59:01.140 --> 59:04.980
typically they do normal like delirium there's this song I'm really loving

59:04.980 --> 59:10.260
yeah I'll tell you about later whatever yeah his microphones on but these mics

59:10.260 --> 59:12.940
are acting very weird I don't know I think it's because this was a cardio

59:12.940 --> 59:16.940
It's because Rob's too loud and Brad's too quiet.

59:16.940 --> 59:19.940
That's what it is. I can't make them both work.

59:19.940 --> 59:21.940
There's no perfect medium, you know?

59:21.940 --> 59:25.940
No, there isn't. It's either you talk too close to the mic of you being Rob,

59:25.940 --> 59:29.940
because obviously pointing does not really, you know, show its way through radio.

59:29.940 --> 59:32.940
Well, there's the camera. They can see it.

59:32.940 --> 59:34.940
You're pointing at the camera. You're pointing at the audience.

59:34.940 --> 59:37.940
You! Camera! You are talking too loud.

59:37.940 --> 59:42.020
no honestly cuz I'm talking and I'm starting to like

59:42.020 --> 59:45.240
you know static out and I'm not even hitting the peak yellow yet

59:45.240 --> 59:48.420
which am I something to do out somewhere I got

59:48.420 --> 59:52.020
I don't even know what the hell you guys did the support here I don't know

59:52.020 --> 59:52.660
where to

59:52.660 --> 59:56.860
you jinx it would show to curse I don't know

59:56.860 --> 01:00:00.420
but anyway check check the levels going into the

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.620
go to the computer check look at the hardware in the computer

01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:07.500
me me me yeah he anyways

01:00:07.500 --> 01:00:09.500
Turn down the mic boost.

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:13.500
What we might want to do is maybe do a mic shuffle back to the mics we used to have.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.500
I don't know.

01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.500
Mic shuffle...

01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.500
Alright.

01:00:16.500 --> 01:00:20.500
I'm on the mic that I used to be on and I'm still fine.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.500
I don't know. It's just...

01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:22.500
It's nothing. I'm not gonna worry about it.

01:00:22.500 --> 01:00:24.500
It's something that I turned up and I'm trying to...

01:00:24.500 --> 01:00:25.500
Moving forward.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:26.500
Yeah, moving on.

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:28.500
I'm sorry. It's just, you know, the sound issues are important.

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:30.500
If they can't hear us, you know.

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:31.500
If they can't hear us, they can turn up the radio.

01:00:31.500 --> 01:00:35.500
So if you're just joining us, we are doing our first show in the brand new studio,

01:00:35.500 --> 01:00:39.100
so we've got audio issues tonight but hopefully we will be able to you know

01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:42.540
make everything work out so just bear with us and we'll get through this it

01:00:42.540 --> 01:00:45.900
also could be that these headphones suck it might be so I'm not gonna worry about

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:50.220
it the chat room has been yelling like when levels are fine I don't know so

01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:55.120
maybe you want to pay attention to them it's on delay yeah all right whatever

01:00:55.120 --> 01:00:58.100
let's try leaving the audio here let's switch back and just see what happens

01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:03.220
looks like our audio is okay now I don't know it's hard to tell so we'll see what

01:01:03.220 --> 01:01:11.220
happens. Moving on, so we have that In the Groove thing going on Wednesday. Let's try

01:01:11.220 --> 01:01:21.900
and think what else is going on in the Bhumani world right now. Anything Dark Sakura that

01:01:21.900 --> 01:01:26.660
you would like to see in the In the Groove release on PlayStation 2 that you didn't see

01:01:26.660 --> 01:01:28.160
in the arcade game?

01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:33.160
Um, a lack of suckage.

01:01:33.160 --> 01:01:44.160
I mean, it didn't 100% suck, but honestly, it's not DDR, you know?

01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:45.600
It's like a big rip-off of DDR.

01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.060
I can't get into it.

01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:51.560
I cannot look at that game without thinking, wow, they totally bid on DDR.

01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:52.560
Sorry.

01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.560
That's how I feel.

01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:58.040
Whoops, my mic was off, sorry.

01:01:58.040 --> 01:01:59.280
That's all right, you're welcome to your opinion.

01:02:02.360 --> 01:02:05.400
What we're going to do now, let's move into talking about

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.480
last week's show.

01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:10.520
And last week's show, we actually had not one, but two

01:02:10.520 --> 01:02:12.640
cage matches that took place last week.

01:02:12.640 --> 01:02:13.880
And it was a tape show.

01:02:13.880 --> 01:02:17.160
And I hope you guys are able to tune in and check it out.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:21.160
And in that, we did two cage matches.

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.120
The first cage match was talking about the

01:02:24.120 --> 01:02:25.480
ultimate cage match.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.480
In other words, we've had three songs that have been retired from Orange Lounge

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:32.840
Cage Match, meaning they won four weeks in a row.

01:02:32.840 --> 01:02:37.280
So we decided to face off each of those songs against each other and see what

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.040
the ultimate Cage Match victor would be.

01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:43.800
So you guys curious to hear which song won that?

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:44.480
Sure.

01:02:44.480 --> 01:02:48.680
All right, based off your votes on orangeloungeradio.com, because that's

01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:53.040
why we voted in both Cage Matches this week, the winning song of the ultimate

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:56.800
cage match meaning that this is just like the best song I guess you guys

01:02:56.800 --> 01:02:59.380
think we've played in the past hundred episodes we've been doing the cage match

01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:01.680
is

01:03:04.100 --> 01:03:13.200
echo image with comeback that was our ultimate cage match because we did each

01:03:13.200 --> 01:03:19.820
song that got retired pay attention like you still all right so echo image will

01:03:19.820 --> 01:03:26.220
comeback was the winner also we did another cage match and that cage match

01:03:26.220 --> 01:03:32.940
was choosing which song should be banned from orange lounge radio forever okay

01:03:32.940 --> 01:03:38.300
and we let you guys vote on that and it's what we call a reverse cage match

01:03:38.300 --> 01:03:44.300
and you guys picked a winner I guess really more appropriately would

01:03:44.300 --> 01:03:50.020
probably be a loser but the if the songs that were up were Britney Spears with my

01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:54.780
prerogative and that was Jamie's pick and then I picked a DJ speedo featuring

01:03:54.780 --> 01:04:00.100
wild side with the ketchup song I'm sorry J and then Loki picked kids bop

01:04:00.100 --> 01:04:10.980
kids doing bring me to life with Corky wake me up all right you guys want to

01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:15.380
You know what song is being banned from Orange Launch Radio Forever?

01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:22.180
Here it is.

01:04:22.180 --> 01:04:29.340
So, Kids Bop Kids, Bring Me To Life, Banned From The Station, Forever, good riddance,

01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:31.340

01:04:31.340 --> 01:04:32.340
Yes.

01:04:32.340 --> 01:04:35.660
Do you have a cage match picked today already?

01:04:35.660 --> 01:04:37.660
Yes, I do.

01:04:37.660 --> 01:04:40.420

01:04:40.420 --> 01:04:49.600

01:04:49.600 --> 01:04:56.560

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.960
gonna go to a break then we're gonna come back and get into a couple other

01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.980
topics and into tonight's cage match I figured to I humored the discussion

01:05:02.980 --> 01:05:06.720
we've been having all actually and our chat room has kind of been asking for

01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:10.400
this for a little while so I'm actually gonna play some music from in the group

01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:19.720

01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.400

I'll tear you down

01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:45.400
Where the people are bleeding deep

01:07:45.400 --> 01:07:49.400
Better stay out, Charlie

01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:24.400
I saw you last night in your fancy outfit

01:08:25.400 --> 01:08:28.400
I'm the man in the dark streets

01:08:29.400 --> 01:08:31.400
With the touch to George's body

01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.400
Let's meet the eyes

01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400
So please take care of yourself

01:08:37.400 --> 01:08:40.400
Don't give away everything you own

01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:43.400
Someone will give you back

01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.400
You understand that you have loved

01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:51.400
Charlene, you're still killing the sister of mine

01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.400
Better stay off the drugs and the wine

01:08:55.400 --> 01:08:58.400
Don't be lost in the danger we see

01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400
My sister Charlene

01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:03.400
Stay out Charlene

01:09:03.400 --> 01:09:07.400
Just beware of the dark side of town

01:09:07.400 --> 01:09:10.400
There's no passion inside to turn you down

01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:14.400
We're the people of need in need

01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:17.600
You better stay up, Charlene

01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:20.600
I'll see you, Charlene!

01:13:17.600 --> 01:13:37.040
easier to dance to than that freaking catch-up song orange lounge radio hey

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.740
guys we're back with more orange laundry yeah the new promos was something else

01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.020
on the list of things to do that didn't get done but we've just been busy you

01:13:44.020 --> 01:13:48.460
We heard about our dramatic week, so we'll just get past

01:13:48.460 --> 01:13:51.620
it and do something more constructive later on.

01:13:51.620 --> 01:13:54.020
We are going to open up the Skype line very, very soon.

01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.140
So head on over to www.orangelauncherator.com and

01:13:57.140 --> 01:13:59.820
click on Interact With Us if you have no clue what I'm

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:00.420
talking about.

01:14:00.420 --> 01:14:01.820
Because that's the only way you guys are going to get to

01:14:01.820 --> 01:14:04.380
call in and interact with our station.

01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.500
First, though, I want to point out the songs that we played

01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.040
in that break.

01:14:07.040 --> 01:14:11.220
We played Banzai with Anubis, Missing Heart, Charlene,

01:14:11.220 --> 01:14:15.500
Smiley with Shusha and Ka with Don.

01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:19.660
Now, here's the interesting thing about Don.

01:14:19.660 --> 01:14:20.940
And I hope I still have this.

01:14:20.940 --> 01:14:22.140
I hope I didn't get rid of it.

01:14:22.140 --> 01:14:23.900
I'll be pissed if I did.

01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:27.060
I probably did and didn't even realize it.

01:14:27.060 --> 01:14:29.340
Shoot, I think I did.

01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:31.300
Let me run a search real quick.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:35.180
Well, we actually used to spin the song Don on our station a

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:39.260
long time ago when we first started.

01:14:39.260 --> 01:14:43.180
And it was one of those, this isn't in a Bimani game yet,

01:14:43.180 --> 01:14:45.420
but it will be someday, we think.

01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.900
And heaven forbid, it actually did show up in a game.

01:14:48.900 --> 01:14:50.740
Although it wasn't really a Bimani game.

01:14:50.740 --> 01:14:52.660
It was more of a, you know, one a Bimani game.

01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.300
But I don't know.

01:14:56.300 --> 01:14:57.500
Wannabeemani, get it?

01:14:57.500 --> 01:14:58.260
Wannabeemani?

01:14:58.260 --> 01:14:59.900
Wannabe?

01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.180
I read that on a forum somewhere.

01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.100
I thought it was funny.

01:15:04.100 --> 01:15:06.060
Darn, I wish we had it.

01:15:06.060 --> 01:15:07.340
I think I actually, oh, no, no.

01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:07.860
I do have it.

01:15:07.860 --> 01:15:08.260
Listen to this.

01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:08.860
Listen to this.

01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:13.140
This is dated July 23rd, 2002.

01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:16.260
This file's dated July 23rd, 2002.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:17.860
That's three years ago.

01:15:17.860 --> 01:15:22.060
And now, an original work that could one day very well be in

01:15:22.060 --> 01:15:23.580
a Bomani game.

01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:26.540
This is Keel with the song Dawn.

01:15:26.540 --> 01:15:31.660
If you like what you hear, visit www.amcast.com slash

01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:34.740
K-E-E-L.

01:15:34.740 --> 01:15:36.700
See, that was like, I don't know how long ago.

01:15:36.700 --> 01:15:37.900
July 2002.

01:15:37.900 --> 01:15:39.960
And I don't even know if that website exists anymore.

01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:41.720
And he changed his name and all that stuff, too.

01:15:41.720 --> 01:15:43.800
So very interesting.

01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:46.000
So let's see.

01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:50.080
We played that before it was in a music rhythm game.

01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:52.480
I think we've had, what, three songs from our cage match that

01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:54.220
ended up in a music rhythm game that we

01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:56.220
played here first.

01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:58.060
I just like thinking we're cool.

01:15:58.060 --> 01:16:01.760
Inflate my ego here a little bit, please.

01:16:01.760 --> 01:16:02.960
All right.

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:04.640
Anyway, let's do this.

01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:05.920
We're going to open up the Skype line.

01:16:05.920 --> 01:16:10.300
And so go ahead and give us a call and we'll hear from what you have to say.

01:16:10.300 --> 01:16:15.800
If you want to talk to us about, what will we let them talk to us about tonight?

01:16:15.800 --> 01:16:19.520
In the Groove, the award show if you guys were listening last night, just whatever is

01:16:19.520 --> 01:16:20.520
on your mind.

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:21.520
You need to talk.

01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:22.520
I really don't care.

01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:27.040
We need to talk about Renee, Sebastian, and her chef, you know, Mrs. Chef is what I'd

01:16:27.040 --> 01:16:28.040
like to call.

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:31.320
Yeah, what was that, those artists that played in the Live 365 Awards.

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:38.320
I had a lot of respect for those folks because they were very passionate and very talented unlike a lot of folks

01:16:38.320 --> 01:16:39.560
I see on the television

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:45.880
But I don't know if I totally was into all the music because that one girl the first girl to sang

01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:52.360
She was totally like chef like her first two songs were very like, you know, like Norah Jones ish, but better like

01:16:52.360 --> 01:17:03.280
I want you to lay me down, and start screwing me up and down, and then you're gonna come

01:17:03.280 --> 01:17:04.280
into me.

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.520
I swear to God that was one of the lyrics, like, you're gonna come into me.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:09.680
And I was like, oh my God, this chick is foul.

01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:11.520
And the gospel people were there too.

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.080
What's great about the song is it went on too long.

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:22.080
She's like, and then I want you up and down, up and down, around, up, down, up and around and ooh, ah, ooh, ah, ah, ah.

01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:29.080
Suddenly she was singing DDR steps and how to find her G-spot, actually. Anyway, we're going to take a call.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.080
Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Who's this?

01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:37.080
Emerging from the shadows of the Mani style, your resident 2DX bastard DarklionXVI is here.

01:17:37.080 --> 01:17:43.880
Alright, alright, alright. No one, everyone doesn't need their own intro, like, you know, we're not gonna do this, like, WWE style, or,

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:50.580
Ooh! Ooh! It's Kinsmell with The Rock Is Cookin'! And then just play the music, and, or anyways, go ahead.

01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580
Whatever.

01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:56.580
You just got told, whatever, he said, whatever.

01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.080
What's on your mind, Ziggy?

01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:03.580
Yeah. Uh, congratulations on, uh, on your new studio.

01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:06.780
thank you it's actually kind of a little bit of a downgrade

01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:10.940
but the apartment itself is very very nice so you know we're

01:18:10.940 --> 01:18:14.100
I'm I'm very happy with it and we like being cozy

01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:17.620
don't we kids I can reach out and touch Jamie in the studio

01:18:17.620 --> 01:18:20.700
my knee

01:18:20.700 --> 01:18:26.380
that was the sound that she made when I touched her knee no we like it it's cool

01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:27.820
we're gonna do a lot of good things here

01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:32.100
so thank you yeah what else is on your mind buddy

01:18:32.100 --> 01:18:41.100
Well, you know, last Friday I was able to play 2DX Red and I, you know, I was able to pass three level 8 plus songs.

01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:44.100
Oh, which one?

01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:49.100
The three songs are Take It Easy, Setsugekka, and Rainbow Rainbow.

01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.100
So wait, you played them past them or you just...

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:53.100
Yeah, I passed them all.

01:18:54.100 --> 01:18:55.100
Well, you big stud.

01:18:55.100 --> 01:19:03.160
Are you one of those folks on Bamani style that gets into those, you know, those pissing

01:19:03.160 --> 01:19:07.600
contests about, you know, I passed this, or yo, I passed this, I passed this blindfolded

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.280
with one hand and I'm better than Lisu and dubba dubba duh.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:13.280
No, I'm not one of those.

01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:14.280
Okay, good, good.

01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:20.640
I just want to say, if you were, we'd have to shoot you.

01:19:20.640 --> 01:19:24.160
But yeah, I just want to have my say about Germania V.

01:19:24.160 --> 01:19:27.400
Wait, you want to say something about Drummania Guitar Freaks V?

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.320
Yeah. What's on your mind?

01:19:29.320 --> 01:19:34.360
Well, uh, yeah, there's some new stuff on Drummania V, as everybody's saying.

01:19:34.360 --> 01:19:38.480
And, uh, yeah, they, you know, they have the, like, uh,

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:41.560
sorting it out, they have, like, they have, uh,

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:44.820
folder 80D or something like that.

01:19:44.820 --> 01:19:46.840
It's really interesting.

01:19:46.840 --> 01:19:52.360
I haven't seen the game myself yet, so I can't really comment, but okay.

01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:56.020
I hope to play it someday, but I refuse to go to Roosevelt Golf Land to look at it because

01:19:56.020 --> 01:20:02.180
that place is a dump, but someday.

01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180
Anything else on your mind?

01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:05.580
Well, that's kind of it.

01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.580
How's night style coming?

01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:09.460
Have you cleared everything yet, or you still have some songs to go?

01:20:09.460 --> 01:20:11.380
Well, I can do bag one-handed.

01:20:11.380 --> 01:20:15.460
What are you doing with it?

01:20:15.460 --> 01:20:17.500
But I haven't made any double A's yet.

01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:19.660
Yeah, what do you do with the other hand?

01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:20.660
What?

01:20:20.660 --> 01:20:24.220
Well, because you play bag one-handed. What does the other hand do?

01:20:24.220 --> 01:20:27.500
Well, it's the scratch, of course. Oh, okay.

01:20:27.500 --> 01:20:30.220
That's boring.

01:20:30.220 --> 01:20:34.020
Lankystyle's calling you out saying that that's two hands if you use one for scratching.

01:20:34.020 --> 01:20:38.220
One hand is actually, you know, just bring keys, it's all two hands.

01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:41.580
I know, a lot of people play, well like,

01:20:41.580 --> 01:20:45.980
I play with like six fingers when I play, usually,

01:20:45.980 --> 01:20:50.140
because I just use my thumb to hit the first two keys and I use my hand for the rest of them.

01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:52.980
So I play six finger. Is that worth something?

01:20:52.980 --> 01:20:57.740
Yeah, six finger. Is six finger 2DX playing worth anything on the forums?

01:20:57.740 --> 01:20:59.180
Like if I go post, I go, hey guys,

01:20:59.180 --> 01:21:02.500
I'm a six finger 2DX player. Who wants to touch me?

01:21:02.500 --> 01:21:06.820
I play one finger when I watch people pass those and others.

01:21:06.820 --> 01:21:10.140
No, one finger. Guess what finger that is?

01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:14.140
Now what do you do with the other nine fingers?

01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:15.860
Nine?

01:21:15.860 --> 01:21:18.940
Well the others are busy being held down while the one is

01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.980
gloriously extended in all of my fuck you glory

01:21:21.980 --> 01:21:26.900
and then the other one is usually a usually a

01:21:26.900 --> 01:21:31.580
I don't know, getting money, I don't know. Getting a dollar.

01:21:31.580 --> 01:21:34.780
Get a dollar. Alright. Put a dollar in the token machine to play something else.

01:21:34.780 --> 01:21:38.180
We're just messing with you, Siggy, that's cool that you... That's alright, that's alright.

01:21:38.180 --> 01:21:40.940
Alright. We're teasing, you know. That's cool that you're doing the one-handed thing.

01:21:40.940 --> 01:21:45.180
I think that's kind of a nice way to play because you know... And lose your other hand free for things like

01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:46.660
Doritos and...

01:21:46.660 --> 01:21:50.500
Or when you play keyboard mania, you're going to want to

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:53.920
be able to do as much of that kind of note thing with one

01:21:53.920 --> 01:21:54.900
hand as possible.

01:21:54.900 --> 01:21:55.860
That's the one thing I always know.

01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.300
Have you played much keyboard mania at all?

01:21:58.300 --> 01:22:01.420
Well, I have played keyboard mania twice back at MGL.

01:22:01.420 --> 01:22:01.820
Right.

01:22:01.820 --> 01:22:04.580
And you really have to do the one hand.

01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:06.980
If you're going to play on the expert levels, you have to be

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.660
able to do things with one hand up here while you're

01:22:09.660 --> 01:22:11.380
doing a completely different note pattern down here, just

01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:13.180
like a normal piano playing, really.

01:22:13.180 --> 01:22:14.740
So that's one thing I noticed.

01:22:14.740 --> 01:22:15.940
I don't know.

01:22:15.940 --> 01:22:21.700
Yeah, the only problem I have with keyboard mania is you don't know which fingers to press.

01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:27.780
They should have that, like which fingers to press, like three as in the middle finger

01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:30.140
or one for the thumb.

01:22:30.140 --> 01:22:32.420
Oh, like a guide as to, you know, what...

01:22:32.420 --> 01:22:33.900
Yeah, it's a guide.

01:22:33.900 --> 01:22:39.140
Yeah, you kind of have to know piano and they teach you that stuff in piano.

01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:41.340
But that would be cool if keyboard mania would show that stuff.

01:22:41.340 --> 01:22:43.700
I mean, hey, what a great sales piece.

01:22:43.700 --> 01:22:47.700
They could sell keyboard mania as a piano teaching device, which I guess they did.

01:22:47.700 --> 01:22:50.540
I didn't hear, they did get a limited release.

01:22:50.540 --> 01:22:54.020
But come on, how many people, who do you know that owns keyboard mania for PC?

01:22:54.500 --> 01:22:55.700
Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, no one.

01:22:55.700 --> 01:22:56.140
That's right.

01:22:57.580 --> 01:23:00.420
So they could, they could mass market that if they wanted to.

01:23:00.420 --> 01:23:06.020
But they should just bring, I don't know, whatever.

01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:11.220
They should, they should have keyboard mania, like literally, you know, typing mania.

01:23:11.220 --> 01:23:15.620
They have that in Japan. The BeatMania da da da.

01:23:15.620 --> 01:23:19.660
And that's what I said when I played it. Da da da.

01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:23.820
Anyway. Alright, we're gonna let you guys take it, but thanks so much for calling in. Have a good one, okay?

01:23:23.820 --> 01:23:27.020
Yeah. Alright, later. Later. Do you have an outro?

01:23:27.020 --> 01:23:30.700
No. Okay. Bye. Later.

01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:34.100
I figured since he had this big introduction that he might have something to say as he's

01:23:34.100 --> 01:23:35.400
leaving, but I guess not.

01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:40.100
Let's see what our next caller has to say. Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio. Hey, SSJ100, Matt here.

01:23:40.100 --> 01:23:43.540
Hello SSJ100, Matt here, what's on your mind?

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:48.980
Nothing, I was ready to give my In The Groove review.

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:50.980
Oh goody, let's hear it.

01:23:50.980 --> 01:23:52.580
Well, you know, I actually got to try it.

01:23:52.580 --> 01:23:57.300
It took him months to get it here, but anyways, at first,

01:23:57.300 --> 01:24:02.420
when I first played it about three times, I hated it.

01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:06.660
I hated the fact of like bombs and other stuff.

01:24:06.660 --> 01:24:08.620
Figured out you could take those off.

01:24:08.620 --> 01:24:12.360
you know actually when you played a bunch of times it's not that bad

01:24:12.360 --> 01:24:15.460
like you started to warm up to it a little bit like at first you're like this sucks

01:24:15.460 --> 01:24:19.500
i hate it but i can't stop playing it right

01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:20.800
that's kinda how i felt

01:24:20.800 --> 01:24:23.300
for a little bit i was ok with it when i first played

01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:24.520
i was just neutral

01:24:24.520 --> 01:24:25.420
I was like

01:24:25.420 --> 01:24:28.480
this isn't as great as all the people on the internet say it is

01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:32.000
but it's not as bad as a lot of people on the internet say it is either so i'm

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:36.760
just gonna stop paying attention to what i read on the internet

01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.720
Now I just switch off between that and DDR.

01:24:40.720 --> 01:24:44.320
So you have both In the Groove and DDR at your local arcade?

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:44.720
Yeah.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:48.040
Do you notice if one is more popular than the other?

01:24:48.040 --> 01:24:50.120
Well, right now In the Groove is way more popular.

01:24:50.120 --> 01:24:53.120
Now I can get on the DDR all the time now.

01:24:53.120 --> 01:24:55.680
You know what's interesting is that that's kind of the first

01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:56.480
I've really heard of that.

01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.520
Because a lot of arcades I've been to, even when I went and

01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:02.640
saw In the Groove in New Jersey last year when it was

01:25:02.640 --> 01:25:06.360
being beta tested or whatever, there were more people on DDR

01:25:06.360 --> 01:25:10.300
extreme than in the groove and I thought that was kind of interesting because I was like

01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:13.720
dude this is like one of two places in the nation where you can actually play this game

01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:18.600
and there's still more people playing DDR and even when I go to the local bowling alley

01:25:18.600 --> 01:25:24.380
that has more games I see more kids on DDR and I think the reason for that is that in

01:25:24.380 --> 01:25:29.240
the groove you know despite the fact that it's a technically good game and it's got

01:25:29.240 --> 01:25:35.080
you know good music and stuff it's just ugly it's a really like ugly game sorry to the

01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:39.960
the folks that designed the graphics, but it's kind of ugly. Like, DDR has that warm,

01:25:39.960 --> 01:25:45.560
saccharine, like, happy, crack vibe, right? Where as In the Groove has that, I'm industrial

01:25:45.560 --> 01:25:51.200
and I don't want anything to do with you vibe. I think maybe that's it. It's too Americanized.

01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:56.040
Maybe. I don't know. Is that, I don't know. So that's why I think more people are always

01:25:56.040 --> 01:25:59.400
on. So what would you say, if you gave In the Groove a score on a scale of one to five,

01:25:59.400 --> 01:26:03.120
what would you say? Well, when I first played it, I gave it about a six, and now it's like

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:06.960
kind of like an eight or so. On a scale of one to five? That's incredible.

01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:10.680
One to five, but I thought you said one to ten. Oh, one to ten. Well, that's fine.

01:26:10.680 --> 01:26:14.560
Doesn't matter, but. Alright.

01:26:14.560 --> 01:26:19.080
Well, what else? Anything else you want to share with us?

01:26:19.080 --> 01:26:23.260
Not really, just congratulations on the new place. Thank you, we appreciate it. We

01:26:23.260 --> 01:26:25.800
hope we can get all our sound working and everything, although I think

01:26:25.800 --> 01:26:28.440
everything's cool now.

01:26:28.440 --> 01:26:32.060
Yep. Alright. Well, thanks to Ablai. Have a good one. Thanks for calling in.

01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.220
Later.

01:26:35.220 --> 01:26:36.660
It's always nice to hear from folks.

01:26:36.660 --> 01:26:38.940
OK, what we're going to do, we're going to go into the

01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:41.580
Orange Lounge cage match right now.

01:26:41.580 --> 01:26:44.260
If you didn't get through, try back again later.

01:26:44.260 --> 01:26:45.860
A lot of you guys just keep hammering us.

01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:49.060
You just call again and again until they get through.

01:26:49.060 --> 01:26:50.460
You can stop doing that, because we're not taking any

01:26:50.460 --> 01:26:53.340

over at www.orange lounge radio.com the song I decided to put in tonight's cage

01:27:48.960 --> 01:27:53.500
match when I first heard this song I was like this song kind of reminds me of

01:27:53.500 --> 01:27:58.860
Of Erotic but without so much cheese like I don't know it's not so

01:28:01.020 --> 01:28:05.500
Stupid I don't know. I I just I thought the song was slightly better. It's more like aqua to me

01:28:05.580 --> 01:28:07.580
I don't know. It's like a mix of the two. We'll see

01:28:08.460 --> 01:28:12.620
All right. Yeah, I know you're excited about this. Anyway, here it is song number one tonight my pick. This is

In the name of, in the name of love

01:29:28.620 --> 01:29:35.620
In the name of, in the name of love

01:30:41.140 --> 01:30:44.640

See the world from above

01:30:48.140 --> 01:30:51.640
In the name of love

01:30:51.640 --> 01:30:55.640
Day by day, night by night

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:58.640
We're together, side by side

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:06.640
In the name of love

01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:13.640
In the name of, in the name of love

01:31:13.640 --> 01:31:20.640
In the name of, in the name of love

01:31:43.640 --> 01:32:03.400
All right that was song number one in tonight's cage match that was jet set in the name of

01:32:03.400 --> 01:32:04.400
love.

01:32:04.400 --> 01:32:07.500
Let's go around and see what we think but remember it's not our vote that counts it's

01:32:07.500 --> 01:32:11.600
yours you've got to be in the chat room and play www.orangetouch.com click on chat.

01:32:11.600 --> 01:32:17.880
Jamie. It gets one. It has no originality to it, nothing innovative. It sounds like

01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:23.520
the same rehash. No offense, I mean, it was perky, and if I wanted to make myself really

01:32:23.520 --> 01:32:29.960
happy, I guess I'd listen to it again. But there was no innovation to it. Nothing new.

01:32:29.960 --> 01:32:36.720
Okay, I'll be nice with three. Alright. Logi. I'll not be nice because I don't like Aqua

01:32:36.720 --> 01:32:39.000
or anything that tries to beat Aqua out here.

01:32:39.000 --> 01:32:43.280
I honestly don't like the whole happy, you know,

01:32:43.280 --> 01:32:45.120
you got one guy that's, you know,

01:32:45.120 --> 01:32:47.160
singing really deep and then the girls,

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:48.960
ah da da da, you know, so.

01:32:48.960 --> 01:32:50.680
But it reminded me of sort of like

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:52.240
the woman's voice is out of place

01:32:52.240 --> 01:32:56.240
and the guy found like a member of, you know,

01:32:56.240 --> 01:32:58.320
the Bloodhound Gang, so I just,

01:32:58.320 --> 01:33:00.360
I didn't really know, it didn't really feel right to me.

01:33:00.360 --> 01:33:03.440
But because it's trying to be happy

01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:05.200
and I'm not happy, it gets a two.

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:12.760
all right my thoughts I think that that song is you know it's like you take the

01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:17.520
ironic and aqua songs which are like so happy to the point of nauseousness and I

01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:21.560
think that song kind of strips a lot of that fakeness off so I think you guys

01:33:21.560 --> 01:33:25.440
are kind of closing yourself off to it because it is a little bit formulaic but

01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:30.400
whatever I think it's decent so I give it a 9 because it puts me in a good

01:33:30.400 --> 01:33:43.400
make me happy. Angel. Uh, 4. Any reason why? It's kind of like awkward, but it's missing something.

01:33:43.400 --> 01:33:52.400
Alright. Yeah. Uh, kdn42. It's happy. It was bouncy. It was generic. 5. Alright. And likeystyle.

01:33:52.400 --> 01:33:58.400
Alright, what? What'd you think of that song? What are we doing here? Forget it. Alright.

01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:00.760
Let's rank the song. What do you think? One to ten?

01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:07.280
All right

01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:11.640
Let's move on song number two is Jamie's pick. What'd you pick for us tonight, Jamie?

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.160
Um, I've been wanting to put this in like a month ago, but I kept winning

01:34:15.840 --> 01:34:19.800
It's Gorillaz Feel Good Inc. I know it's been playing on the radio, but I

01:34:20.400 --> 01:34:27.360
Really really like this song a whole bunch. It's it's I really like everything they've been doing with music. It's been innovative

01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:31.760
it's been new it's been taking the whole pop genre in a different direction so

01:34:31.760 --> 01:34:37.560
and this one it just has a really sexy bass line too so I want that it's in all

01:34:37.560 --> 01:34:41.560
Alright, here it is, song number two, Gorillaz Feel Good Inc. Enjoy.

01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:23.560
The city's breaking down on the camel's back They just have to go cause they don't know where

01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:30.560
So while you fill the streets, there's a billion to see You won't get out of the county cause you're nearly free

01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:33.760
You got a new horizon, it's ephemeral style

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:37.260
A melancholy town where we never smile

01:35:37.260 --> 01:35:41.260
And all I wanna hear is the message beating my dreams

01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:44.560
They got a kisser cause I don't get sleep, no

01:35:48.060 --> 01:35:51.260
We mail, we mail for the land

01:35:51.260 --> 01:35:54.760
The forever hanging land

01:35:54.760 --> 01:35:58.260
Take it or leave it on your stride

01:35:58.260 --> 01:36:03.260
It is taking for all in and love forever

01:36:03.260 --> 01:36:06.760
Love is free, let's turn forever

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.760
You and me

01:36:08.760 --> 01:36:11.760
Windmill, windmill for the mind

01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.260
It's everybody in

01:36:18.260 --> 01:36:20.760
Laughing, gasping, hazmat, fat cat

01:36:20.760 --> 01:36:22.760
Lining them up like abstract

01:36:22.760 --> 01:36:24.260
Play these ponies at track

01:36:24.260 --> 01:36:26.260
It's my chocolate attack

01:36:26.260 --> 01:36:27.760
Shoot, I'm steppin' in harder to skip

01:37:27.760 --> 01:37:31.760
Kick it all out on your stride

01:37:31.760 --> 01:37:34.760
It is taking for all

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.760
It's our love forever, love is free

01:37:37.760 --> 01:37:41.760
Let's turn forever, you and me

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:44.760
Windmill, windmill for the land

01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:49.760
It's everybody else

01:37:52.760 --> 01:37:54.760
Go shop, see the dish

01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:57.420
The fire captain said his baby watching Savagreen.

01:37:57.420 --> 01:37:59.420
Ha ha ha ha ha!

01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:01.420
Go shop, see the dude.

01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.420
The fire captain said his baby watching Savagreen.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:06.420
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:38:06.420 --> 01:38:22.420
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:29.420
Song number two there, Guerrillaz with Feel Good Inc.

01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:30.420
How did you guys feel?

01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:32.420
Did that make you feel good or make you feel sick?

01:38:32.420 --> 01:38:36.100
sick let's see Dark Sakura I've been listening to this song for two months

01:38:36.100 --> 01:38:40.460
and haven't gotten sick of it yet so it gets a 10 automatically the whole album

01:38:40.460 --> 01:38:44.420
gets a 50 million so yeah by demon days when it comes out

01:38:44.420 --> 01:38:47.420
lucky

01:38:49.940 --> 01:38:58.260
okay I had no mic no I have a good baseline I don't know it's just it's

01:38:58.260 --> 01:39:04.900
Okay, I mean I like gorillas. I love their older stuff. It's just there's parts of the song

01:39:04.900 --> 01:39:09.660
I didn't like then the other parts are okay, so it just gets like a seven or eight

01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:13.700
Eight I guess

01:39:13.900 --> 01:39:15.500
um

01:39:15.500 --> 01:39:20.620
That song is kind of like a big cake to me like you've got frost like it's a multi-layer cake

01:39:20.620 --> 01:39:22.540
You've got this really like nice frosting

01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:26.180
And then there's like really sweet stuff in the middle like the fruit kind of well

01:39:26.180 --> 01:39:32.500
you know we're talking like strawberry frosting oh no you had me going at frost

01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:36.260
okay okay cream cheese how about chocolate frosting chocolate frosting

01:39:36.260 --> 01:39:39.780
all right fine and then like in the middle is like i don't know like extra

01:39:39.780 --> 01:39:43.780
chocolate so it's really sweet my point is it's really sweet like but the rest

01:39:43.780 --> 01:39:47.380
of it's kind of cake it's just cake you know like because that song is kind of

01:39:47.380 --> 01:39:51.620
like three things combined it feels like to me like there's different elements or

01:39:51.620 --> 01:39:54.900
it's like you got a good cake and then they throw in that stupid custard

01:39:54.900 --> 01:39:58.660
and he's like, oh god damn you, how did you ruin a good cake?

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:01.600
That's kind of like it, because there's two elements to that song,

01:40:01.600 --> 01:40:04.860
I really, especially one of the slow parts to the song,

01:40:04.860 --> 01:40:06.640
I really, really, really like.

01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.020
The slow parts are very blur.

01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:10.200
Yeah, see I like blur, I think that's why.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:12.960
But then like the Day of the Soul stuff, that's like the custard.

01:40:12.960 --> 01:40:14.420
I'm not good on it.

01:40:14.420 --> 01:40:15.440
See, I like the opposite.

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:19.320
I like the Day of the Soul stuff, but I hated the slow parts.

01:40:19.320 --> 01:40:22.960
Then I feel the opposite, but the score is still the same, I give it an 8.

01:40:22.960 --> 01:40:24.820
Angel.

01:40:24.820 --> 01:40:26.820
yeah I look good as well

01:40:26.820 --> 01:40:28.820
so I will give it an 8

01:40:28.820 --> 01:40:30.820
alright

01:40:30.820 --> 01:40:32.820
not just because I'm copping you but not because I'm helping you

01:40:32.820 --> 01:40:34.820
but just because you're copping us

01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:36.820
arkadian

01:40:36.820 --> 01:40:38.820
I like Boston cream pie

01:40:38.820 --> 01:40:40.820
good

01:40:40.820 --> 01:40:42.820
yeah Boston cream pie is cake with custard

01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.820
yeah custard

01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:46.820
and not grill is rock 2

01:40:46.820 --> 01:40:48.820
9

01:40:48.820 --> 01:40:50.820
alright uh lanky style

01:40:50.820 --> 01:40:52.820
um

01:40:52.820 --> 01:40:56.820
I don't think it makes me feel good, it makes me feel pretty ink, you know, but it's incorporated.

01:40:56.820 --> 01:41:04.820
Um, no, you know what, I hate gorillas, like, they're always the source of any problem in, like, a sci-fi story.

01:41:04.820 --> 01:41:06.820
Gorillas are monkeys too, right?

01:41:06.820 --> 01:41:11.820
No, those are, you're thinking of, uh, uh, monkeys are not gorillas.

01:41:11.820 --> 01:41:13.820
Okay, well, they're apes, they're simians, right?

01:41:13.820 --> 01:41:16.820
The monkeys had Mickey Dolenz!

01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:17.820
And Davey Jones.

01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:19.820
Go over into this, exactly, Bradley.

01:41:19.820 --> 01:41:21.820
However, Congo was a bad movie.

01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:27.820
Gorillaz learn sign language and talk to us. Gorillaz are smart, except for QD.

01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:30.820
And apparently they can sing through a megaphone.

01:41:30.820 --> 01:41:37.820
And they also, you know, take women and run up the Empire's Day segment.

01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:40.820
They run them up the Empire's Day building. Man, that is...

01:41:40.820 --> 01:41:43.820
Will you please give the song a rating so we can finish this goddamn segment?

01:41:43.820 --> 01:41:46.820
Okay, hold on. A little backstory here.

01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:52.820
Um, no, really. I think this is the only good song on the new album. I've listened to the whole thing and I'm not impressed.

01:41:52.820 --> 01:41:55.820
The last album was much better in my opinion.

01:41:55.820 --> 01:42:01.820
Um, but it's still a good song. Like I said, it's the best song on the album, so it gets for me an 8.

01:42:01.820 --> 01:42:06.820
Um, but it's gonna get old for me really quick. I've already listened to it like 4 times, but I'm still kinda like, hmm.

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:11.820
I did like the slow parts better than the rest of it. It's, I prefer blur.

01:42:11.820 --> 01:42:12.820
Alright.

01:42:12.820 --> 01:42:17.940
Let's get into the last song of tonight's cage match, Loki what did you pick?

01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:28.820
Well I hope this is what's on this track here, uh, well hopefully this is um, oh my god I'm

01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:35.160
saying hopefully a polytery track, anyway, hopefully this is the song from um, the Midnight

01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:39.780
Tune 2 soundtrack.

01:42:39.780 --> 01:42:45.140
I got midnight maximum soon too. Yeah, that's not or that that that CD. Anyway, it's an awesome game

01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:49.460
It's like a it's sort of a initial D ish type thing

01:42:49.460 --> 01:42:51.100
It's got pretty cool music in it

01:42:51.100 --> 01:42:57.940
But then there's Paul Terry and Paul Terry, you know, honestly, um, I hate Paul Terry I hear but it's a face

01:42:57.940 --> 01:43:01.460
The Paul Terry Niocchi combo that Paul Terry now see that it's bad

01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:08.220
Other artists that's okay. And this is a song that she sings in

01:43:08.220 --> 01:43:14.940
Um, okay, I don't remember the original artist, um, it's Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Polteri.

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:21.180
A guy that did music for Actraiser, and so this is the, um, song, um, Nothing Can Live

01:43:21.180 --> 01:43:22.180
Forever.

01:43:22.180 --> 01:43:26.020
Yuzo Koshiro featuring Polteri, Nothing Can Live Forever, song number three.

01:43:26.020 --> 01:43:27.820
I am crossing my fingers, I hope this is the right studio.

01:43:27.820 --> 01:43:28.820
Enjoy.

01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:43.820
The time has come to say goodbye

01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:55.820
Because nothing can be forever

01:43:55.820 --> 01:44:04.820
But I'll keep calling out for you

01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:18.820
I see the air stirring and churning

01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.820
Cheer the speed of the chains

01:44:23.820 --> 01:44:27.820
I am reaching my truth.

01:45:53.820 --> 01:45:57.820
I refuse to take your cover, love

01:46:04.820 --> 01:46:06.820
Can't catch up

01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:16.820
I don't mind if I'm not the one in love for you

01:46:16.820 --> 01:46:30.820
The time must come to say goodbye

01:46:30.820 --> 01:46:40.820
Because nothing can keep me forever

01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:47.820
But I keep going on and on

01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:12.820
You

01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:45.820
the

01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:50.820
the

01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:55.820
the

01:48:55.820 --> 01:49:00.820
the

01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:05.820
the

01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:15.980
Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:49:15.980 --> 01:49:22.140
That was Yuzo Koshiro featuring Polteri with Nothing Can Live Forever.

01:49:22.140 --> 01:49:28.980
Will that song live forever in your memory or is it going to die right now, Jamie?

01:49:28.980 --> 01:49:33.360
I don't like Polteri because she can't hold a key to save her life.

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:51.360
It was still pretty good. I mean, it's too trance for my taste, but overall it presented an image. That's what I can say. I like music that presents a picture, and that one I definitely got a feeling from, so it gets an eight from me.

01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:53.220
Logie

01:49:53.220 --> 01:49:58.140
You know this song I like her to be gained her with her like first thing you know over it

01:49:58.340 --> 01:50:00.340
It's kind of like you know

01:50:00.500 --> 01:50:05.960
It kind of built job for but then the song has like but I don't know it's an okay song

01:50:05.980 --> 01:50:11.020
But I had because I haven't cut down certain other songs that I need to be submitting to the cage match

01:50:11.300 --> 01:50:12.460
but uh

01:50:12.460 --> 01:50:14.820
So it gets an eight that's the best

01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:18.460
I'm gonna give it because but you got to check out the whole soundtrack really cool

01:50:18.460 --> 01:50:24.460
Um, I like the first minute, and then the other four I fell asleep. I gave it a six.

01:50:24.460 --> 01:50:25.460
Angel.

01:50:25.460 --> 01:50:33.460
It was pretty cool, um, I'll be nice and give it a seven. Because I don't know what else

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:35.460
to give it, whatever.

01:50:35.460 --> 01:50:36.460
Arcadian.

01:50:36.460 --> 01:50:41.460
Eh, it was alright. I wasn't all that impressed. I haven't listened to the soundtrack yet,

01:50:41.460 --> 01:50:43.460
but I'll give it a six.

01:50:43.460 --> 01:50:44.460
Lanky style.

01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:51.700
Thank you, so I'm one of the weird people who believe that voluntary can only do good when she couples with a belonging artist artist

01:51:04.300 --> 01:51:08.740
All right, let's recap it's about time to vote but first let's recap remember

It's close enough.

01:51:45.300 --> 01:51:46.300
Close enough.

01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:50.700
Featuring Politary, I did that from memory, Yuzo Koshiro, sorry, featuring Politary with

01:51:50.700 --> 01:51:57.700

01:52:16.540 --> 01:52:18.540
No twist here, sorry.

01:52:18.540 --> 01:52:23.540
Alright, this is the part of the show where I would always ask Loki what's going on in the sim scene.

01:52:23.540 --> 01:52:27.540
I don't know if you've been keeping tabs on what's going on, but what's up, Loki?

01:52:27.540 --> 01:52:38.540
Not that much. Honestly, really nothing going on. There's only like a couple things I'd like to mention.

01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:55.540
First off, as far as sim packs being released, not really too much this week. However, there's this wonderful site that someone created because I don't know if you remember ddramerica.com, the old Bomani Torrent site.

01:52:55.540 --> 01:53:05.540
No kidding, I was trying to fix that. Actually, it went down a while ago because sharing copied stuff is bad.

01:53:05.540 --> 01:53:26.540
But anyways, there's this new one now called alt-control-delete-dot-com, and, uh, it's starting off to be a new, uh, Bimani, um, BitTorrent tracker, and you've got some of the, um, pop-in music, um, soundtracks, and, um, some 2DX, it's mainly soundtrack rips right now.

01:53:26.540 --> 01:53:30.540
So, I guess that's something worth mentioning.

01:53:30.540 --> 01:53:36.300
that room is yelling BMS contest and I guess something I think oh yeah but my

01:53:36.300 --> 01:53:43.140
cells BMS contest they have that going on right now you sound excited I mean

01:53:43.140 --> 01:53:50.820
come on now folks I mean really I guess it could be cool I mean cuz but I I just

01:53:50.820 --> 01:53:59.660
you know what the Japanese doing BMS files I I don't think us it's just gonna

01:53:59.660 --> 01:54:04.220
be up to par with it I'm sorry the Japanese have like got you beat by a lot

01:54:04.220 --> 01:54:09.420
that that's my opinion on this stuff I mean you play Japanese BMS files and

01:54:09.420 --> 01:54:15.180
you're like holy crap this stuff is like could have been in Beatmania or in 2dx

01:54:15.180 --> 01:54:18.980
or something it's just really high quality stuff well also there there's

01:54:18.980 --> 01:54:23.220
more of a team mentality to from what I understand it's set up like a

01:54:23.220 --> 01:54:29.060
professional production crew I bet if more of the American producers of the

01:54:29.060 --> 01:54:32.580
the BMS files got together and put the same kind of effort into it, they could come up

01:54:32.580 --> 01:54:33.580
with a quality product.

01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:34.580
Look at Food Mix.

01:54:34.580 --> 01:54:37.540
Food Mix is a perfect example of like production quality.

01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:39.620
I mean that's just top notch stuff right there.

01:54:39.620 --> 01:54:43.440
You could honestly, if you know, they had the permission, you could release a DDR mix

01:54:43.440 --> 01:54:47.860
of all Food Mix stuff and it would, you wouldn't have to really change anything to it.

01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:49.780
It would look great.

01:54:49.780 --> 01:54:55.620
And that's what's, you know, really cool about, you know, and BMS stuff is exactly the same.

01:54:55.620 --> 01:54:57.980
They do all their remixing stuff on there.

01:54:57.980 --> 01:55:02.340
The production quality is incredibly awesome.

01:55:02.340 --> 01:55:05.760
And even with stuff, they only have movie files playing in

01:55:05.760 --> 01:55:06.220
the background.

01:55:06.220 --> 01:55:12.340
It's all just stop motion with bitmaps and jpegs and stuff.

01:55:12.340 --> 01:55:15.300
And it still looks incredible.

01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.380
I don't even know how to describe it.

01:55:16.380 --> 01:55:16.900
It's awesome.

01:55:16.900 --> 01:55:19.140
This is where OnoKen and stuff got its start,

01:55:19.140 --> 01:55:20.940
is with the BMS files.

01:55:20.940 --> 01:55:25.820
And, you really, I'm sorry, the U.S. is not gonna be able to come close.

01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:31.580
They can try, but I've already had high standards for BMS files, and I'm afraid,

01:55:31.580 --> 01:55:36.000
you know, like most everything else that the U.S. does, as far as SIM files go,

01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:39.220
I'm gonna be disappointed. But, hey, you know,

01:55:39.220 --> 01:55:43.180
I'd like to still see what comes of this, too, because it'll be interesting.

01:55:43.180 --> 01:55:46.780
You can get some- There's gotta be at least one quality file that comes with it. Oh yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some

01:55:46.780 --> 01:55:50.420
some good stuff, but there's gonna be some crap stuff, too. I don't have the patience to make a

01:55:50.420 --> 01:55:54.140
step mania file let alone a BMS file you know I bet the three of us could get

01:55:54.140 --> 01:55:59.820
together and do a really good BMS I would better things we spend our time

01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:08.620
doing like eating sleeping sleeping or working on our station or something

01:56:08.620 --> 01:56:15.580
doing promos all right and we don't do those but yeah so there's nothing really

01:56:15.580 --> 01:56:23.100
going on as far as that is concerned what else oh yeah there's some more boss

01:56:23.100 --> 01:56:29.180
files released by DJ pedo who like most other people I call themselves DJ is not

01:56:29.180 --> 01:56:35.860
a DJ and boss files are retarded I like to mention you know for those who don't

01:56:35.860 --> 01:56:41.840
know boss files are they're incredibly hard hard DWIs they're basically beat

01:56:41.840 --> 01:56:48.520
media for step mania which it's just crap it's crap it's crap it's crap don't

01:56:48.520 --> 01:56:53.440
play them yeah man that's not the number one problem with step mania files out

01:56:53.440 --> 01:56:56.880
there on the internet as they're all trying to be be mania because nobody

01:56:56.880 --> 01:56:59.840
plays step mania with an actual dance pad they're all using their fingers so

01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:02.500
when they triple-a songs are taking screen caps of it and posting how big

01:57:02.500 --> 01:57:06.080
their internet penis is because they triple-a to song with their fingers on a

01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:10.520
dance game and then they complain because a lot of the ten footers and

01:57:10.520 --> 01:57:14.080
stuff are too easy. Well, yeah, because you're using your fingers, dumbass. Try using your

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:21.240
feet. Exactly. Anyway. All right, you guys, let me hear who won tonight's cage match.

01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:25.280
Show up! All right, you know what's interesting is that last week I think we had the most

01:57:25.280 --> 01:57:29.440
number of votes I've ever seen in a cage match in a recent memory, and this week we have

01:57:29.440 --> 01:57:32.600
some of the least number of votes in a cage match in a recent memory, so I don't know

01:57:32.600 --> 01:57:38.520
what's up. Family guy. Huh? Family guy. Is it because of family guy? Come on, people.

01:57:38.520 --> 01:57:43.200
was leaked to the internet like two weeks ago. I know, I've had an emergency all week.

01:57:43.200 --> 01:57:48.000
You can get a torrent later or stop being cheap and buy a TiVo. We are far more important

01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:52.460
than that damn show. They'll just cancel it again, and you'll be sad. Oh man, that show's

01:57:52.460 --> 01:57:57.780
awesome. Alright. But our show's awesomer. That's right, we're awesomer. Alright, anyway,

01:57:57.780 --> 01:58:04.780
tonight's cage match winner is... In the name, or, not in the name of love, my bad, nothing

01:58:04.780 --> 01:58:11.780
can live forever. Oh my god. I thought Gorillaz would have won. Yuzo Koshiro. I don't know,

01:58:13.360 --> 01:58:17.140
maybe on another night where everybody was voting, but tonight we only had. Oh my god,

01:58:17.140 --> 01:58:21.100
that's just like hardcore listeners voting. This was a filler song until I picked a good

01:58:21.100 --> 01:58:24.640
one. Eh, it always works that way. Just wait until after we get back from E3 and the Demon

01:58:24.640 --> 01:58:28.140
Days album is actually released so I can put that one song in. Mm-hmm. Because I can't

01:58:28.140 --> 01:58:33.860
put it in before the album's out. Out of support for the band. Alright. Actually, I have to

01:58:33.860 --> 01:58:39.620
it wasn't a bad song. You could play it. I will actually go ahead and say it was a bad

01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:47.620
song. I could, but I won't. I know right away that it was a bad song. That's why I put it

01:58:47.620 --> 01:58:53.180
in. I can't see how you can call my song repetitive and then put that in. I could play it, but

01:58:53.180 --> 01:59:02.180
I won't, out of respect for my favorite band. I could play it. I'm teasing. Alright, anyway,

01:59:02.180 --> 01:59:04.820
Let's see, what are we going to do now?

01:59:04.820 --> 01:59:08.420
Actually, I want to do the DDR Freak post of the week,

01:59:08.420 --> 01:59:09.240
because this is exciting.

01:59:09.240 --> 01:59:13.940
By the way, DDR Freak does run our rewinds every Friday night

01:59:13.940 --> 01:59:17.600
over on The Freak, so you guys should check that out.

01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:22.100
If you ever miss part of this show, so if you must skip us

01:59:22.100 --> 01:59:25.980
and go watch Family Guy, then I suppose you could catch up

01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:28.140
with us on Friday night over on DDR Freak.

01:59:28.140 --> 01:59:31.100
We're on the same week now, so tonight's show you will hear

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:33.100
this friday you have to wait a week anymore

01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:36.500
credit books and you could download this dvd quality

01:59:36.500 --> 01:59:37.460
on the internet

01:59:37.460 --> 01:59:42.860
uh... my psp we watched it yesterday if i watched a lucky psp already okay and

01:59:42.860 --> 01:59:45.420
granted it was very funny

01:59:45.420 --> 01:59:49.580
it's still the same level of funny as it all yeah it's it's really funny and i

01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:53.540
highly recommend it but not because it's against our show i'm sorry but you can't

01:59:53.540 --> 01:59:55.100
go

01:59:55.100 --> 01:59:57.060
exactly but we tried

01:59:57.060 --> 01:59:58.380
Yeah, they'll re-run it.

01:59:58.380 --> 02:00:00.340
You can get it on BitTorrent.

02:00:00.340 --> 02:00:05.780
You can get a TiVo, stop being cheap, set your VCR.

02:00:05.780 --> 02:00:07.100
Or tape us, I suppose.

02:00:07.100 --> 02:00:08.460
But it's a little harder to tape the internet.

02:00:08.460 --> 02:00:12.820
Or buy satellite and watch it East Coast time.

02:00:12.820 --> 02:00:13.260
There you go.

02:00:13.260 --> 02:00:13.580
There you go.

02:00:13.580 --> 02:00:15.500
Because the East Coast people saw it before our show was on.

02:00:15.500 --> 02:00:15.940
Exactly.

02:00:15.940 --> 02:00:19.300
Anyway, let's get to the DER Freak post of the week.

02:00:19.300 --> 02:00:29.180
A bunch of crazies over there on DER Freak. No, I'm kidding. There's some really great

02:00:29.180 --> 02:00:32.820
people on DER Freak, but once in a while you get a few loonies that make very interesting

02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:36.880
posts. And tonight's DER Freak post of the week was suggested to me by one of our chatters.

02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:42.180
I want to say it was, uh, LXLdubes that suggested this one, and if it wasn't you and it was

02:00:42.180 --> 02:00:48.580
somebody else, I apologize to that person. I think it was him. What? Oh. Hey. Post of

02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:53.580
This is the week, this is not Turbo Graphic Segment, this is DDR Free Post of the Week, sorry.

02:00:53.580 --> 02:00:57.580
Subject! The subject for this post.

02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:59.580
DDR Fairy Tales.

02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:03.580
You know, I came so close to locking that damn thread, and then I thought, nah.

02:01:03.580 --> 02:01:06.580
Here it is. Here's the post.

02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:09.580
I just thought this would be a funny idea.

02:01:09.580 --> 02:01:14.580
Try to make a random fairy tale out of as many DDR song titles as possible.

02:01:14.580 --> 02:01:16.580
Good luck!

02:01:16.580 --> 02:01:20.580
Well, okay, that post isn't that great, but let's see some of the replies.

02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:28.580
Once upon a time in the kingdom of Max 300, there was a noble prince named Jam Jam Reggae.

02:01:30.580 --> 02:01:33.580
Okay, Yam Yam Ragu.

02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:38.580
What the hell was that? I don't know anybody named Jam Jam Reggae, do you?

02:01:38.580 --> 02:01:40.580
Makes no sense whatsoever.

02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:48.980
Uh, let's see. Once upon a time, a prince upon a star, which is a Beatmania song, not

02:01:48.980 --> 02:01:54.740
a DDR song, visited the Queens, Jamaica, again Beatmania, not DDR, where he met a man named

02:01:54.740 --> 02:02:01.580
Gamble. If you want to get technical, you know, they were, um, in a club mix, whatever.

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:06.320
Again, he met a man named Gamble. But these songs weren't made famous. They were first

02:02:06.320 --> 02:02:07.800
to beat mania, shut up.

02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:11.520
This man had a lovely senorita named Nori Nori Nori.

02:02:11.520 --> 02:02:14.600
Then they all died because they got ran over by a cowgirl

02:02:14.600 --> 02:02:16.240
going maximum overdrive.

02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:19.480
The end.

02:02:19.480 --> 02:02:23.240
Honestly, these share same place in my heart as with

02:02:23.240 --> 02:02:26.160
those three word stories.

02:02:26.160 --> 02:02:27.680
I think I should have lost it.

02:02:27.680 --> 02:02:30.040
There was one that went on for like a whole page, and if you

02:02:30.040 --> 02:02:33.200
think I'm reading it, you're freaking crazy.

02:02:33.200 --> 02:02:35.120
I'll read one more here.

02:02:35.120 --> 02:02:36.360
Let's see.

02:02:39.360 --> 02:02:42.240
Yeah, this was Alex L. Dubes that recommended it, because

02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:43.360
he made a post in here.

02:02:43.360 --> 02:02:44.920
It says, DDR fairy tales.

02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:46.080
Ooh, ooh, let me try.

02:02:46.080 --> 02:02:48.240
There once was a village of people who had no life.

02:02:48.240 --> 02:02:49.560
And what a surprise, there was a DDR

02:02:49.560 --> 02:02:52.800
machine in the village.

02:02:52.800 --> 02:02:54.440
That one's good.

02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:56.280
You know what we need to actually do instead of the

02:02:56.280 --> 02:02:56.880
fairy tales?

02:02:56.880 --> 02:02:58.960
We need DDR limericks.

02:02:58.960 --> 02:03:00.000
Dirty ones.

02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:01.720
Dirty DDR limericks?

02:03:01.720 --> 02:03:02.880
Yeah.

02:03:02.880 --> 02:03:04.840
Well, this one starts out, it might sound dirty.

02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:06.080
Here's the last one I'm gonna read.

02:03:06.080 --> 02:03:10.200
Once upon a time there was a man named Max, period.

02:03:10.200 --> 02:03:12.800
He went up to a La Señorita.

02:03:12.800 --> 02:03:14.800
Buenos dias, he helped.

02:03:14.800 --> 02:03:20.800
I think Buenos dias should be a DDR song.

02:03:20.800 --> 02:03:24.760
Buenos dias!

02:03:24.760 --> 02:03:25.880
Oh my God.

02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.600
They needed a Spanish version of Max.

02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:31.000
What?

02:03:31.000 --> 02:03:32.600
They needed a Spanish version of Max.

02:03:36.760 --> 02:03:37.440
I'm sorry.

02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.640
He went up to a La Senorita.

02:03:38.640 --> 02:03:40.200
Buenos dias, he yelled.

02:03:40.200 --> 02:03:42.440
He then offered her some candy.

02:03:42.440 --> 02:03:45.440
All of a sudden, in a wild rush, she began to scream,

02:03:45.440 --> 02:03:46.840
waka, waka.

02:03:46.840 --> 02:03:48.760
Max yelled, don't break down.

02:03:48.760 --> 02:03:50.640
Wait a minute, she screamed.

02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:52.360
You have broken my heart.

02:03:52.360 --> 02:03:55.560
He then began to feel like he hit a dead end.

02:03:55.560 --> 02:03:58.760
You've been cheating on me, huh, Max, period, she screamed.

02:03:58.760 --> 02:04:01.080
I like to share my love, he responded.

02:04:01.080 --> 02:04:02.880
Nothing gonna stop, he added.

02:04:02.880 --> 02:04:05.320
She then said, make love to me.

02:04:05.320 --> 02:04:07.660
The reflex took over and they banged.

02:04:07.660 --> 02:04:09.040
The end of the century.

02:04:10.800 --> 02:04:13.520
Okay, that one's good, that one's good.

02:04:13.520 --> 02:04:16.020
That one wins a lack of angst for me.

02:04:18.520 --> 02:04:21.000
The reflex took over and, well, they banged.

02:04:21.920 --> 02:04:23.380
Buenos dias.

02:04:23.380 --> 02:04:40.900
I love the way people write on DDR free. The reflex took over and you know they banged.

02:04:40.900 --> 02:04:46.800
Did she bang? Comment from our chat room and VX JasonXV really wants me to read this because

02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:52.460
he's posted it three times. I thought it was a fairy tale, not a retardation and bastardization

02:04:52.460 --> 02:05:00.380
song titles come on jason buenos dias uh fairy tale get it because it's a song

02:05:03.260 --> 02:05:04.060

we gotta talk about something all right what um remember that we posted something about

02:05:17.740 --> 02:05:22.060
Alright, what do you want to say about Karaoke Revolution?

02:05:22.060 --> 02:05:26.620
There's that song from Dirty Dancing in it, and I'm scared because there's a Karaoke Revolution

02:05:26.620 --> 02:05:27.780
4.

02:05:27.780 --> 02:05:28.780
The end.

02:05:28.780 --> 02:05:35.460
Okay, Karaoke Revolution is, they're gonna have, I had the time of my life.

02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:38.860
I'm not gonna sing the whole thing, that's the most you're gonna get from me, but you

02:05:38.860 --> 02:05:40.740
know that song.

02:05:40.740 --> 02:05:44.340
Hopefully at E3 we'll get to see some Karaoke Revolution 4, and we'll make Loki play.

02:05:44.340 --> 02:05:47.060
And hopefully at E3 we will not see Patrick Swayze.

02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:52.300
Hopefully all right. We'll be back, but buenos dias has me in a mambo a go-go mood

02:05:52.300 --> 02:05:56.380
So we're gonna play some mambo music this break, so we'll start it off with el bimbo

02:05:56.380 --> 02:06:02.120
Buenos dias Max 300, buenos dias El Bimbo, we'll be back after this with more Orange

02:06:02.120 --> 02:06:09.120
lounge.

02:06:32.120 --> 02:06:36.120
The

02:06:36.120 --> 02:06:40.120
The

02:06:40.120 --> 02:06:44.120
The

02:06:44.120 --> 02:06:48.120
The

02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:52.120
The

02:06:52.120 --> 02:06:56.120
The

02:06:56.120 --> 02:07:00.120
The

02:07:30.120 --> 02:07:31.120
Hey!

02:07:31.120 --> 02:07:32.120
Hey!

02:07:32.120 --> 02:07:33.120
Hey!

02:07:33.120 --> 02:07:34.120
Hey!

02:07:34.120 --> 02:07:35.120
Hey!

02:07:35.120 --> 02:07:37.120
You

02:08:35.120 --> 02:08:51.100
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, nine, nine, ten.

02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:53.100
Oh

02:10:51.100 --> 02:10:58.100
Why do you cry when you're happy, it's just something special

02:10:58.100 --> 02:11:05.100
Why do you see what I don't see starting in the blue sky

02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:09.100
It's just something special

02:11:09.100 --> 02:11:12.100
Now that you see what I've done

02:11:12.100 --> 02:11:17.100
Stay talking in the blue sky

02:11:17.100 --> 02:11:20.100
There is so much to come

02:11:20.100 --> 02:11:24.100
It's all a destination

02:11:24.100 --> 02:11:27.100
And have a sip into a really deep

02:11:27.100 --> 02:11:31.100
And you'll see that with the beer

02:11:31.100 --> 02:11:33.100
Check, check, check

02:11:33.100 --> 02:11:46.100
Check, one two check, check, check, one two check, check, check, one two check, check, check, one two check

02:11:46.100 --> 02:11:52.400
Check, check, check, check, check, one two check, check, one two check, sound check check check

02:11:54.200 --> 02:12:01.100
There is so much to hide in my collection

02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:08.100
And have a seat in who I really think you'll be without me today

02:12:10.100 --> 02:12:12.100
Are you with me all the way?

02:12:13.100 --> 02:12:15.100
I'm happy today

02:12:20.100 --> 02:12:24.100
For the best part of Orange Lab, this PDR sucks!

02:12:25.100 --> 02:12:26.100
Holla!

02:12:26.100 --> 02:12:27.100
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

02:12:27.100 --> 02:12:28.100
We want to learn more!

02:12:28.100 --> 02:12:29.100
That's right, PS!

02:12:29.100 --> 02:12:42.100
Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140 in progress, and we're

02:12:42.100 --> 02:12:47.300
going to get into the FUs of the week relatively shortly, but first, I know we usually talk

02:12:47.300 --> 02:12:50.900
about DDR a whole lot on this show, but we know you guys are into some other games too,

02:12:50.900 --> 02:12:54.820
because you check out our podcast, which we talk about other games, and I know one game

02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:59.780
series that Konami also does that's very popular is Silent Hill, and Jamie's going to give

02:12:59.780 --> 02:13:02.580
us an update on something that's going on in the Silent Hill world.

02:13:02.580 --> 02:13:09.420
Really, my updates are just from over the week. They've got the, you know, the basic

02:13:09.420 --> 02:13:15.020
story of course has been out on the web for some time. They're in pre-production now.

02:13:15.020 --> 02:13:17.580
For the Silent Hill movie, correct? Yes.

02:13:17.580 --> 02:13:23.660
So far cast is Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland. Sean Bean is in it as her character's

02:13:23.660 --> 02:13:31.660
husband. For Lord of the Rings fans, he was Boromir. And then somebody named Jodelle Fairland

02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:38.980
as the daughter in the movie. But they were saying in this one article, and I'll link

02:13:38.980 --> 02:13:46.660
it in the chat room in just a moment, they had the production cost, I think it's expected

02:13:46.660 --> 02:13:52.020
the top $25,000 per day during the shoot.

02:13:52.020 --> 02:13:54.580
So it's going to be, of course, several million dollars

02:13:54.580 --> 02:13:55.500
to produce this movie.

02:13:55.500 --> 02:13:57.780
They've got big hopes for it.

02:13:57.780 --> 02:13:59.260
There are pictures out on the net.

02:13:59.260 --> 02:14:02.820
I'm trying to find the link I had that had, like, 60-some

02:14:02.820 --> 02:14:04.140
odd pre-production picture.

02:14:04.140 --> 02:14:06.020
There actually is a link on orangehelmsradio.com in the

02:14:06.020 --> 02:14:08.340
story we ran earlier this week that has a link to it, if

02:14:08.340 --> 02:14:09.980
it's still valid, which I think it is.

02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.820
Actually, I do believe it is.

02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:15.300
But I'm also going to copy this article for the chat room.

02:14:15.300 --> 02:14:17.580
It's really good.

02:14:17.580 --> 02:14:19.460
And it's talking about actually the town that they're

02:14:19.460 --> 02:14:24.180
filming it in and how the people are reacting to it.

02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:25.300
Very cool.

02:14:25.300 --> 02:14:25.700
There it is.

02:14:25.700 --> 02:14:27.740
I'm looking forward to that movie very much.

02:14:27.740 --> 02:14:33.020
It should be, I'm hoping that they stay loyal to the games.

02:14:33.020 --> 02:14:37.020
If they stay loyal to the games, it'll be so cool.

02:14:37.020 --> 02:14:39.220
But if they try to do the Resident Evil thing, it's

02:14:39.220 --> 02:14:40.020
going to suck.

02:14:40.020 --> 02:14:42.060
So I really hope they don't turn it into like zombie

02:14:42.060 --> 02:14:47.940
horror action film but you know kind of that subtle like mess with I think it's

02:14:47.940 --> 02:14:52.940
gonna stay with the with the way the games are on I'm it I'm hopeful from the

02:14:52.940 --> 02:14:56.420
pictures I mean it seemed like it's exactly the same because you know how in

02:14:56.420 --> 02:15:04.560
the games everybody is linked to the whole rebirth thing you know this one

02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:09.300
seems almost like it would be some like an innocent bystander just caught up in

02:15:09.300 --> 02:15:14.700
what's going on from what I can tell it's looking pretty cool I'm hoping it

02:15:14.700 --> 02:15:17.180
comes out soon I know it's not out so next year but you never know what might

02:15:17.180 --> 02:15:22.500
happen I need this all right it's time for the F use the week boys and girls if

02:15:22.500 --> 02:15:26.140
you want to send in an F you of the week send your private message to sky in the

02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:29.540
chat room with whatever you want to give an F you to please keep them short as

02:15:29.540 --> 02:15:32.620
we've got a lot of people that probably want to get their F use in if your F you

02:15:32.620 --> 02:15:37.260
goes on and on non you will get cut off just like that we don't have to read

02:15:37.260 --> 02:15:41.860
your f-you anyway but we will because we know you're angsty like us so dark

02:15:41.860 --> 02:15:47.140
Sakura why is it that we do the F use of the week every single week and because

02:15:47.140 --> 02:15:50.060
Jamie can't have chocolate

02:15:50.060 --> 02:16:10.780
Fuck you to car accidents and all the shit that's happened to my car, god damn it.

02:16:10.780 --> 02:16:14.920
You know, I loved my CD player even though it was a piece of shit.

02:16:14.920 --> 02:16:18.880
And I loved my car even though it's also a piece of shit.

02:16:18.880 --> 02:16:21.020
But I didn't need to be in the goddamn accident.

02:16:21.020 --> 02:16:25.180
I certainly am tired of not being able to walk up a damn flight of stairs because my

02:16:25.180 --> 02:16:27.820
hip hurts like in excruciating pain.

02:16:27.820 --> 02:16:31.520
This is after Vicodin and Flexerol, so fuck the whole thing.

02:16:31.520 --> 02:16:33.600
This is what I'm angsty about.

02:16:33.600 --> 02:16:40.160
And also, I hate taking the medication anyway because it makes my head feel all funny.

02:16:40.160 --> 02:16:44.300
And when my head feels funny, I tend to say weird things instead of just go off on people.

02:16:44.300 --> 02:16:47.760
And I went off on people at work, and that's not good.

02:16:47.760 --> 02:16:53.080
So I ended up going home because I went off on people.

02:16:53.080 --> 02:16:54.780
I hate feeling like this.

02:16:54.780 --> 02:16:56.900
I hate the crap that's happening in my car.

02:16:56.900 --> 02:17:01.560
And honestly I wish that someone would just run into my car with a semi so that their

02:17:01.560 --> 02:17:03.960
insurance would buy me a brand new fucking car.

02:17:03.960 --> 02:17:08.920
I also F you to my apartment complex and the stupid bitch that manages it.

02:17:08.920 --> 02:17:14.040
She doesn't do her job for shit and keeps letting these wannabe thug gangsters move

02:17:14.040 --> 02:17:15.040
in next door.

02:17:15.040 --> 02:17:17.320
And it's no longer a safe place to live.

02:17:17.320 --> 02:17:22.680
I also fucking hate the stupid, uh, cost of houses in this, uh, state,

02:17:23.080 --> 02:17:26.440
especially in Sacramento and the Bay area, of course, is a lot more expensive,

02:17:26.880 --> 02:17:29.920
but it's hard to find a house for under $350,000.

02:17:30.280 --> 02:17:31.240
And you know,

02:17:31.240 --> 02:17:35.920
if we have to move out to Yuba city to freaking have a house that is worth a damn

02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:37.360
and not have to, you know,

02:17:37.760 --> 02:17:42.040
pay everything for the rest of our lives to have this house, then so be it,

02:17:42.040 --> 02:17:46.600
you know, I'll put up with the extra drive, but I did find a cute house though,

02:17:46.600 --> 02:17:53.560
but it's small and they want a bunch for it it's just a nightmare you know i fucking hate growing

02:17:53.560 --> 02:17:59.240
up now even though it's gonna be nice to have a house oh life's gonna suck when you grow up

02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:09.640
when you grow up when you grow up uh you know it's just all of you kids in the chat room you have no

02:18:09.640 --> 02:18:15.240
right to complain about living with your parents because you don't have to pay for shit if i hear

02:18:15.240 --> 02:18:18.920
Here you bitching one more time, I'm going to come to your house and slap you upside

02:18:18.920 --> 02:18:19.920
of the head.

02:18:19.920 --> 02:18:22.960
Unless you aren't paying the mortgage by yourself, then you can't bitch.

02:18:22.960 --> 02:18:24.960
Or pay rent.

02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:27.560
And even then, you can move out when you're fucking 18.

02:18:27.560 --> 02:18:31.720
Although I don't recommend it, live with your parents as long as you can, milk them for

02:18:31.720 --> 02:18:37.800
every cent they're worth, because it sucks when you have to do it all by yourself.

02:18:37.800 --> 02:18:39.520
I'm done.

02:18:39.520 --> 02:18:40.520
Loki.

02:18:40.520 --> 02:18:47.520
Ahh, chocolate gooood.

02:18:47.520 --> 02:18:52.520
No, anyways, now the chocolate's gone.

02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:55.520
I need more chocolate! Now that!

02:18:55.520 --> 02:19:05.520
Anyways, um, no, I was, um, I'm very pissed off at the fact of my weekends being, in general, too busy for me.

02:19:05.520 --> 02:19:09.520
I don't even get a chance to actually relax during the whole weekend.

02:19:09.520 --> 02:19:11.920
No, those are peanut butter cups. I hate peanut butter cups.

02:19:11.920 --> 02:19:13.920
I like expensive chocolates.

02:19:15.920 --> 02:19:16.820
Ugh...

02:19:16.820 --> 02:19:20.120
I-I like non-expensive chocolates that used to be expensive.

02:19:20.120 --> 02:19:21.820
Anyways, um...

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.120
So, fuck you to goddamn weekends being too damn long,

02:19:25.120 --> 02:19:27.320
and fuck you to having to drive...

02:19:29.020 --> 02:19:30.120
Just...

02:19:30.120 --> 02:19:31.320
Stressful, okay?

02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:32.120
Ooh!

02:19:33.120 --> 02:19:34.620
Thank you!

02:19:34.620 --> 02:19:36.220
I got more chocolates.

02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:37.320
Um...

02:19:37.320 --> 02:19:38.020
Anyway...

02:19:38.020 --> 02:19:41.220
Fuck you to bad drivers, because they're everywhere.

02:19:41.220 --> 02:19:45.460
Everywhere, everywhere. I was coming home from dropping off Rob yesterday,

02:19:45.460 --> 02:19:49.580
and this guy is just passing me at like 50 miles an hour faster than where I'm going.

02:19:49.580 --> 02:19:52.900
Granted, I'm going about 75 on the freeway.

02:19:52.900 --> 02:19:56.660
He's just all, shoo! Like, all- No, I was in the car when that happened.

02:19:56.660 --> 02:20:00.860
That guy was crazy. Yeah, I don't even know what that was. I mean, that was just nuts.

02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:04.100
People, honestly, I mean, I see-

02:20:04.100 --> 02:20:07.860
I'm going like, you know, 75 or something. I consider that pretty, you know,

02:20:07.860 --> 02:20:12.820
um you know that's some pretty good speeding right there i mean you don't want to go crazy

02:20:12.820 --> 02:20:17.380
because you know there's a lot of cars out there but there's people are zooming past me you know

02:20:17.380 --> 02:20:22.660
just like nothing you know i don't understand why everyone's in such a hurry nowadays and it

02:20:22.660 --> 02:20:28.740
was funny though today one person did just like a the same thing you know zoomed right past me

02:20:28.740 --> 02:20:35.860
that cop car zoomed right past me and pulled the sucker over oh that was great um then um

02:20:35.860 --> 02:20:43.820
Well, I was gonna say, um, fuck you to Live365 for not giving me more free crap.

02:20:43.820 --> 02:20:48.300
I like free crap and all I got was a stupid t-shirt that I'm probably not gonna wear.

02:20:48.300 --> 02:20:49.980
Last year we had a lot more free crap.

02:20:49.980 --> 02:20:53.140
We got a lot more free crap last year, I was very disappointed at the lack of free crap

02:20:53.140 --> 02:20:54.140
this year.

02:20:54.140 --> 02:20:58.260
I'm just like, I'm trying to figure out why, what exactly cost the twenty, what am I getting

02:20:58.260 --> 02:20:59.380
for this twenty dollars?

02:20:59.380 --> 02:21:00.380
That's what I wanna know.

02:21:00.380 --> 02:21:04.380
You got to see that girl sing those dirty ass lyrics about that guy being up all in

02:21:04.380 --> 02:21:05.380
her.

02:21:05.380 --> 02:21:12.380
Yeah, but I wasn't that guy all up in her, so it wasn't really, you know, worth the $20, that's what I'm trying to say.

02:21:12.380 --> 02:21:17.380
If you'd gotten a chance to go up all in her, and she wrote that song about you, would it have been worth the $20?

02:21:17.380 --> 02:21:19.380
That would have been worth the $20.

02:21:19.380 --> 02:21:26.380
I got two things. One, I've got a bunch of free crap coming, you can have it. Three, I'll drop it in the toilet or something if you want.

02:21:26.380 --> 02:21:34.380
Two, hold on, two, you guys have to pay to go to the awards, even though you are on the ballot, so to speak?

02:21:34.380 --> 02:21:39.620
play a fun game lanky style let's play how much was each ticket no better yet

02:21:39.620 --> 02:21:43.860
let's play how much did it cost for all three of us to go to the award ceremony

02:21:43.860 --> 02:21:52.140
guess now hundred dollars less 75 less well this is no fun he's guessing hi I'm

02:21:52.140 --> 02:21:56.520
including gasps okay no no oh well shit if you're gonna take just the tickets

02:21:56.520 --> 02:22:02.160

02:22:02.160 --> 02:22:09.740
anyways also fuck you to the embassy suite hotel having their stupid okay now

02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:14.700

02:22:14.700 --> 02:22:19.140
jump onto with my PSP it was no password free but it wasn't let me connect for

02:22:19.140 --> 02:22:22.420
some reason that pissed me off damn those protected internet because I

02:22:22.420 --> 02:22:27.620
wanted to jump onto the chat room that was in the live 365 and write dirty

02:22:27.620 --> 02:22:34.560
stuff but I couldn't do that and so that made me sad and then fuck you for to

02:22:34.560 --> 02:22:44.000

02:22:44.000 --> 02:22:49.280

02:22:53.600 --> 02:22:57.240
get one of those like every a Comcast employee knew what they were doing hey

02:22:57.240 --> 02:23:00.560
Hey, hey, you know they happen every now and then.

02:23:00.560 --> 02:23:05.120
I guess for, uh, it's Chaos Theory.

02:23:05.120 --> 02:23:06.760
Yep, exactly.

02:23:06.760 --> 02:23:09.240
So there are the few, the select few.

02:23:09.240 --> 02:23:11.560
Yeah, we, we love Comcast, we really do.

02:23:11.560 --> 02:23:15.160
Please don't pull the plug, please don't pull the plug.

02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:19.240
Oh, and um, um, also, um, fuck you, Zach B.

02:23:19.240 --> 02:23:23.000
for just putting a picture of my leg.

02:23:23.000 --> 02:23:25.160
And, uh, I can, I, I can understand, okay.

02:23:25.160 --> 02:23:27.200
Be glad at least your leg got in there.

02:23:27.200 --> 02:23:31.000
good shot, you know, it was an action shot, but you know, the next page they have a picture

02:23:31.000 --> 02:23:35.840
of Rob's face. I'm like, what about my face? No one knows what I look like. I am just a

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:42.120
floating leg. Well, it's semi-transparent, mind you. That just goes to prove I'm sexier.

02:23:42.120 --> 02:23:45.760
I'm just kidding, I don't... Did you see the way I looked in that picture, though? I'm

02:23:45.760 --> 02:23:48.400
like, eehh, I look like Corky. I don't know, it was just me or not, but he looked like

02:23:48.400 --> 02:23:54.080
a freakin' sasquatch. I swear, he looked, his eyebrows looked, yeah, raw. No, no, it's just

02:23:54.080 --> 02:23:58.580
I don't know what it was, but your eyebrows looked especially white in the picture, so you look like that.

02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:00.580
I had big, bushy eyebrows.

02:24:00.580 --> 02:24:05.580
You don't have, okay, for anybody who hasn't seen Rob, which I'm pretty sure all of our listeners...

02:24:05.580 --> 02:24:08.580
Well, I'm on the cam right now, so it's dark as hell in here, so they can't see anything.

02:24:08.580 --> 02:24:10.580
Like, you don't have white eyebrows.

02:24:10.580 --> 02:24:13.580
I don't know what happened with that picture, but it looked like you seriously had no eyebrows,

02:24:13.580 --> 02:24:15.580
because they looked like they were shaving off in that picture.

02:24:15.580 --> 02:24:17.580
Well, maybe they had to photoshop me, because...

02:24:17.580 --> 02:24:19.080
My hideous face!

02:24:19.080 --> 02:24:22.580
They're like, this guy's actually better looking than most radio personalities.

02:24:22.580 --> 02:24:24.580
We got to make him look bad

02:24:27.860 --> 02:24:34.100
Using crime technology, we're gonna eat him to look like sasquatch moving on

02:24:44.940 --> 02:24:49.900
An F you to the fact that moving out took me like three weeks to do but I'm very happy it's over now an F

02:24:49.900 --> 02:24:53.140
to the fact that we probably won't get the deposit back because landlords are

02:24:53.140 --> 02:24:56.900
cunts. Actually, our old landlords are pretty decent, I can't knock them, they

02:24:56.900 --> 02:25:01.480
were decent, but we'll see if we get the deposit back or not. And I may be back

02:25:01.480 --> 02:25:07.560
here in three weeks saying that they are bitches but we'll see, so...yeah if you did

02:25:07.560 --> 02:25:11.540
that, and if you did the fact that I really don't feel like I had a vacation

02:25:11.540 --> 02:25:14.620
even though I've had three days off of works I've had like a five-day weekend I

02:25:14.620 --> 02:25:18.700
don't feel like I had a vacation at all. I'm so tired and I'm like, oh my god I

02:25:18.700 --> 02:25:22.380
I have to go to work tomorrow life sucks. I hate being a grown-up. I hate it

02:25:23.500 --> 02:25:26.780
Let's see what other people in our room have to say for the F use of the week

02:25:26.780 --> 02:25:29.880
We'll start it off with where we gonna go Arcadia 42

02:25:33.160 --> 02:25:35.680
Fuck you to my computer being old and slow and

02:25:36.340 --> 02:25:43.100
Can't really afford a new one right now. Hopefully soon, but I put myself in more debt. I'm in right now. Oh

02:25:43.100 --> 02:25:47.300
Oh well. And fuck you to the next week, because it's gonna be so low at work.

02:25:47.300 --> 02:25:51.300
I'll be bored half the time. And, nah.

02:25:51.300 --> 02:25:56.300
I get it. That's about it.

02:25:56.300 --> 02:25:59.300
Ice Queen. That's Princess Bitch.

02:25:59.300 --> 02:26:04.100
Whatever. You're the biggest queen of them all.

02:26:04.100 --> 02:26:06.300
That's true.

02:26:06.300 --> 02:26:11.100
I don't know. Sorry, somebody... Give the FUs! Stop screaming like a bitch.

02:26:11.100 --> 02:26:15.780
okay fuck you to Toyota's for being pieces of shit and trying to rip me off

02:26:15.780 --> 02:26:23.860

So, um...

Work is... Okay.

02:26:54.020 --> 02:26:56.020
Work is work. Um, I will shut up now. Bye-bye.

02:26:56.020 --> 02:26:58.020
Alright. Lanky style.

02:27:00.020 --> 02:27:04.020
Uh, just, uh, fuck you to people who don't take care of your cars, and you post them online, saying,

02:27:04.020 --> 02:27:08.420
Oh, there's nothing wrong with it I swear and then you totally sound like a dipshit on the phone

02:27:08.420 --> 02:27:12.860
Who doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about? I guess that should be a big red flag and make me wonder, you know, why?

02:27:14.020 --> 02:27:17.980
so we go check out these cars and we're gonna go buy them and they're like

02:27:18.460 --> 02:27:21.620
they don't change the oil for like 10,000 miles and

02:27:22.260 --> 02:27:23.380
Yeah

02:27:23.380 --> 02:27:25.380
People just don't know how to take care of their cars

02:27:25.420 --> 02:27:27.420
We yeah

02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:33.420
Loki supposed to change your oil. Yeah, you're not supposed to run the same oil in it for you know ever

02:27:33.980 --> 02:27:36.380
Eventually, it gets pretty nasty doesn't do its job

02:27:37.300 --> 02:27:39.300
Yeah, okay

02:27:42.020 --> 02:27:44.380
Really yeah, remember when you got those tires

02:27:52.180 --> 02:27:54.300
Yeah, you have to get your tires rotated you should I

02:27:54.300 --> 02:27:56.300
I

02:27:56.940 --> 02:28:00.740
Heard once like I heard this rumor that some cars you have to put air in your tires. Is that true?

02:28:01.500 --> 02:28:07.140
Well, some of them actually have a totally solid Center like a cream filled. Oh like a Twinkie

02:28:07.140 --> 02:28:10.900
Yeah, I think I have Twinkie tires. Yeah, you won't need to fill those with air

02:28:15.140 --> 02:28:16.540
Twinkie

02:28:16.540 --> 02:28:22.300
Honestly Twinkie tires with the best invention ever at least if you know, you're tired pull the flyer. Oh, yeah

02:28:22.300 --> 02:28:24.300
Yeah! Twinkie filly!

02:28:24.300 --> 02:28:26.300
Woohoo!

02:28:26.300 --> 02:28:29.300
Mmm! I'm full of twinkie goodness.

02:28:29.300 --> 02:28:31.300
This is a delicious flat.

02:28:31.300 --> 02:28:34.300
Now I just need to make a deep fryer big enough so I can fry them whenever I'm done.

02:28:34.300 --> 02:28:36.300
It reminds me of that one Spamusement.

02:28:36.300 --> 02:28:39.300
Which, by the way, is the best online comic of all time, Spamusement.

02:28:39.300 --> 02:28:40.300
Yeah, Spamuse is awesome.

02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:42.300
Just hang up, don't listen to the show anymore.

02:28:42.300 --> 02:28:44.300
It says something about, are you man enough for this?

02:28:44.300 --> 02:28:47.300
And then it's like a deep-fried truck.

02:28:47.300 --> 02:28:56.300
What was it like, I don't remember what it was, like, Dale Earnhardt Jr. on a flatbed with a fishing pole, deep fried with country gravy.

02:28:58.300 --> 02:29:05.300
It was amusement. S-P-A-M-U-S-P. Spam-musement. Just take amusement and put SP on it.

02:29:05.300 --> 02:29:05.800
Yeah.

02:29:05.800 --> 02:29:07.300
Alright. Anyway, moving on.

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:08.300
Amusement SP.

02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:11.300
DarkSakura, I have one more after you before we get to the chatroom, if yous.

02:29:11.300 --> 02:29:15.220
just back to the the other thing I was saying before

02:29:15.220 --> 02:29:19.020
for everybody who and this actually goes a lot broader

02:29:19.020 --> 02:29:22.380
for all of you people who bitch about the situation you're in

02:29:22.380 --> 02:29:27.740
fucking make a change you know who just do nothing but complain about it when there

02:29:27.740 --> 02:29:30.780
are ways to make it better and then they don't do it

02:29:30.780 --> 02:29:34.420
because it's effort or it'll rock the boat

02:29:34.420 --> 02:29:39.660
or as a da da da stop bitching take control of your fucking life

02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:44.780
I'm done. I actually forgot one more F.U. of myself.

02:29:44.780 --> 02:29:49.980
F.U. to the fact that to go see the Lion King, it cost $75

02:29:49.980 --> 02:29:53.420
to sit in the first tier. I was in the first balcony,

02:29:53.420 --> 02:29:58.100
$75 seats, and for that price, you would expect that there would be some nudity.

02:29:58.100 --> 02:30:01.540
And there was no nudity. Yo, nudity where? In the Lion King.

02:30:01.540 --> 02:30:06.700
I don't think that's nudity. I was very upset at the lack of nudity in the Lion King

02:30:06.700 --> 02:30:10.700
considering how much was paid unless it was uh what's his name uh the guy that did hairspray

02:30:11.580 --> 02:30:16.300
if you did you liking well you know i realized that everybody brought their kids and they were

02:30:16.300 --> 02:30:20.860
selling t-shirts that said baby's first musical stuff i wanted nudity were you hoping for simba's

02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:28.460
shaved balls if nothing else or you know where or mufasa and whatever i wanted to see mufasa's

02:30:28.460 --> 02:30:32.140
Mufasa. That's all. Mufasa's like, it's time to make a baby.

02:30:35.580 --> 02:30:39.900
All right, Ice Queen, do you want one last F.U.? No, yes, no.

02:30:41.500 --> 02:30:44.940
My last F.U. was to Effort because I heard Jamie's F.U.s and

02:30:45.580 --> 02:30:50.620
fuck Effort. Screw that. I want to live and be rich and not have to move a freaking muscle.

02:30:50.620 --> 02:30:54.700
I want to win the lottery and be just a complete leech on the side. You could be like that lady

02:30:54.700 --> 02:30:55.700
in Florida.

02:30:55.700 --> 02:30:56.700
That's my dream.

02:30:56.700 --> 02:30:58.260
But see, there's a difference.

02:30:58.260 --> 02:30:59.420
You're not complaining about it.

02:30:59.420 --> 02:31:01.260
I'm talking about to the people who say, I live...

02:31:01.260 --> 02:31:04.460
I was gonna say, I was just not complaining.

02:31:04.460 --> 02:31:10.740
He doesn't call you at, you know, nine o'clock at night, my life sucks, what'd you do today?

02:31:10.740 --> 02:31:13.500
Uh, nothing, I thought about paying a bill.

02:31:13.500 --> 02:31:18.740
Now, I'm just talking about all the people who live with, who live with their parents

02:31:18.740 --> 02:31:24.980
and say, oh my parents don't respect me, and they make me do this, and they're 30.

02:31:26.020 --> 02:31:30.020
My parents bought me the old model SUV because they don't love me.

02:31:30.020 --> 02:31:33.620
My parents want me to stop whoring out and go back to junior high.

02:31:34.980 --> 02:31:38.660
My mom, my mommy yells at me, but I'm gonna go out and buy an iPod.

02:31:40.260 --> 02:31:41.860
Let's go to the chat room, shall we?

02:31:42.900 --> 02:31:45.300
Started off with Miklatov, and Miklatov says,

02:31:45.300 --> 02:31:48.940
FU to not welcoming a cute boys advances because I suck

02:31:48.940 --> 02:31:53.980
FU to being sick all week, FU to E3 being too far away and FU to general

02:31:53.980 --> 02:31:54.620
boredom

02:31:54.620 --> 02:31:58.260
Miklotov if you were here I would not be shunning your advances so you don't have to

02:31:58.260 --> 02:31:58.920
worry about that

02:31:58.920 --> 02:32:01.940
aww how nice are you. Illusion

02:32:01.940 --> 02:32:05.500
says FU to a boring weekend that's it not angsty this week

02:32:05.500 --> 02:32:09.420
oh and FU to about Schmidt for horribly depressing me by saying how significant

02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.100
life is

02:32:10.100 --> 02:32:13.260
and FU to the live 365 awards

02:32:13.260 --> 02:32:20.260
You guys were O.L. Robbed. Get it? O.L.R. O.L. Robbed. Get it?

02:32:22.220 --> 02:32:26.260
Zaku says, F you to the drunk tards in another apartment in my apartment complex

02:32:26.260 --> 02:32:29.820
who thought that the place needed a more loud cowbell last night.

02:32:29.820 --> 02:32:32.820
F you to having to work off the books to make a living

02:32:32.820 --> 02:32:37.900
and F you to having to put off finding a summer job till after finals

02:32:37.900 --> 02:32:42.980
when there probably won't be any good jobs left.

02:32:42.980 --> 02:32:47.140
2005 says F you to this guy who keeps calling me and waking me up

02:32:47.140 --> 02:32:50.580
dark lion xvi

02:32:50.580 --> 02:32:54.360
says F you to spring valley high school for spending my cousin and his friend

02:32:54.360 --> 02:32:59.020
just because they were victims of a gang fight my cousins the one who got hit in

02:32:59.020 --> 02:33:00.100
the head with a hammer

02:33:00.100 --> 02:33:04.380
and his friend saved his life yet they were not yet they were suspended and

02:33:04.380 --> 02:33:06.140
were about to face expulsion

02:33:06.140 --> 02:33:09.300
this is all over the local news and I hope they're embarrassed about it

02:33:09.300 --> 02:33:14.060
Were they trying to reenact when Mario gets the- nevermind I don't wanna go there.

02:33:14.060 --> 02:33:19.340
F-U to WY- WY- WY- WIN-LAS VEGAS, sorry, for being the most disappointing opening on the

02:33:19.340 --> 02:33:20.340
strip.

02:33:20.340 --> 02:33:22.780
Too many flowers on the inside and it's almost like the Bellagio.

02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:25.520
The only good thing about that place is the damn poker room.

02:33:25.520 --> 02:33:32.500
F-U to KVVU-Fox5 Las Vegas for misspelling my cousin's last name.

02:33:32.500 --> 02:33:37.420
DarkTetsuya says, F-U to whatever was causing my loss of appetite about a week and a half

02:33:37.420 --> 02:33:38.420
ago.

02:33:38.420 --> 02:33:42.600
That would probably be Roseanne naked.

02:33:42.600 --> 02:33:46.800
That's it! You guys are kinda not, not angsty tonight.

02:33:46.800 --> 02:33:51.240
I thought I was plenty angsty. Well no, not you, you guys are, you guys are plenty

02:33:51.240 --> 02:33:53.200
angsty, but I mean like the chat room.

02:33:53.200 --> 02:33:56.400
They didn't vote and they weren't angsty. What's wrong with you guys?

02:33:56.400 --> 02:33:59.800
I think we're background noise for a lot of people tonight.

02:33:59.800 --> 02:34:03.640
I noticed, you know... They're watching Family Guy. Damn them. We should just

02:34:03.640 --> 02:34:06.720
spoil it. No, we, we better not do that. Everybody dies!

02:34:06.720 --> 02:34:11.060
Yeah, everybody dies, the boat sinks, sorry.

02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:12.160
Peter and...

02:34:12.160 --> 02:34:16.900
Suey's gay.

02:34:16.900 --> 02:34:21.160
Peter and Lois have sex, multiple times.

02:34:21.160 --> 02:34:24.680
Alright, we're gonna go to a quick break, then we're gonna come back and do some

02:34:24.680 --> 02:34:28.560
Ask Orange Lounge. I know it's been a little while since we've given you guys an

02:34:28.560 --> 02:34:30.360
opportunity to ask us questions,

02:34:30.360 --> 02:34:34.400
but we've been gone a couple weeks, so we're back. So you're gonna Ask Orange Lounge,

02:34:34.400 --> 02:34:39.220
So send a private message to Sky in the chatroom with any questions that you may have in this break

02:34:39.700 --> 02:34:45.540
Because I got yelled at it for not playing it last break. We're gonna play from Papa music ago, huh? We're gonna play

02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:48.280
You see honey, so we'll start off with that break

02:34:48.280 --> 02:34:51.900
And we'll do some other pop music 12 stuff since we have it and it's new it's new

02:34:51.900 --> 02:34:57.660
We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. Don't go anywhere.

02:36:21.900 --> 02:36:24.900
Give me a lotta, too, lotta, too, lotta

02:36:24.900 --> 02:36:28.900
Baby, baby

02:39:58.900 --> 02:39:59.900
Whoa!

02:39:59.900 --> 02:40:01.880
Whoa!

02:40:01.880 --> 02:40:03.880
Whoa!

02:40:03.880 --> 02:40:05.860
Whoa!

02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:08.860
Whoa!

02:40:08.860 --> 02:40:09.860
Whoa!

02:40:09.860 --> 02:40:12.360
Whoa!

02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:14.840
Whoa!

02:40:14.840 --> 02:40:16.840
Whoa!

02:40:16.840 --> 02:40:19.840
Whoa!

02:40:19.840 --> 02:40:23.840
Whoa!

02:40:23.840 --> 02:40:26.340
Whoa!

02:40:26.340 --> 02:40:27.840
Whoa!

02:40:27.840 --> 02:40:55.340
Thank you very much.

02:42:57.840 --> 02:43:14.540
We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio and as promised we're going to get into a little

02:43:14.540 --> 02:43:15.540
bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:15.540 --> 02:43:20.720
This is where you guys get to direct the future of the show by asking us questions about what

02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:22.500
you would like to hear us talk about.

02:43:22.500 --> 02:43:24.260
See we're interactive like that.

02:43:24.260 --> 02:43:34.420
So here we go with some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:34.420 --> 02:43:39.660
Let's Ask Orange Lounge, some stupid question, what will we find out this week on Orange

02:43:39.660 --> 02:43:40.660
Lounge Radio?

02:43:40.660 --> 02:43:46.080
It would be nice if I could concentrate, but the people in the kitchen are making so much

02:43:46.080 --> 02:43:48.280
Goddamn noise that I can't think straight

02:43:53.600 --> 02:43:56.640
Song or song number one. See I can't think straight today, uh

02:43:57.280 --> 02:44:03.440
Jaded 2005 with question number one me and my girlfriend have never seen you guys's faces

02:44:03.440 --> 02:44:05.440
What do you guys look like?

02:44:09.160 --> 02:44:13.420
Folks from the kitchen saying they look like whores. Well, the question wasn't about the folks in the kitchen

02:44:13.420 --> 02:44:23.580
it's about us in here. What do we look like? We're damn sexy! There's pictures of us online.

02:44:23.580 --> 02:44:35.780
I look like Tom Cruise, and Matt looks like Matt Damon, and Dark Sakura looks like Angelina

02:44:35.780 --> 02:44:41.980
Jolie, just like her. I'm making stuff up so that they can fantasize. Well at least

02:44:41.980 --> 02:44:47.980
What does it look like a freakin' toothpick like Nicole Kidman's turned herself into, anorexic?

02:44:47.980 --> 02:44:52.980
Um, actually, if you guys want to see our pictures, we do have a picture gallery if you're a registered user of orangeisontrated.com.

02:44:52.980 --> 02:44:59.980
But we don't spam you, there's no reason not to sign up. Just head on over and you'll see the picture galleries and you can actually see pictures of us at E3.

02:44:59.980 --> 02:45:08.980
So there's like plenty of pictures there from last year's E3. Even Jamie, who's typically camera shy, can be seen in those pictures if you know where to look.

02:45:08.980 --> 02:45:11.580
Alright, question number two from Allusion.

02:45:11.580 --> 02:45:14.980
Allusion would like to know, and perhaps Jamie you can answer this one for Allusion.

02:45:14.980 --> 02:45:18.380
Allusion would like to know, why do women have breasts?

02:45:19.980 --> 02:45:23.780
Genetically to provide sustenance for the child.

02:45:25.380 --> 02:45:28.180
And to bring home a paycheck at the end of the day.

02:45:29.780 --> 02:45:30.580
Stop.

02:45:31.180 --> 02:45:33.580
It's for feeding babies.

02:45:33.780 --> 02:45:35.180
It is for feeding babies.

02:45:35.180 --> 02:45:39.100
and for entertaining four year old men who pay enough

02:45:39.100 --> 02:45:42.300
just shut up

02:45:42.300 --> 02:45:49.300
and sometimes kittens because I saw that once on a Japanese TV show

02:45:51.620 --> 02:45:56.220
okay moving on

02:45:56.220 --> 02:46:00.540
yeah they just say breast milk is best only on this show would somebody ask that

02:46:00.540 --> 02:46:02.220
question why do women have boobies

02:46:02.220 --> 02:46:05.820
Hey, ask your mama. Dear Orange Lounge,

02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:09.780
what's sex? Why do I have a pee pee?

02:46:09.780 --> 02:46:14.340
Mikotov would like to know

02:46:14.340 --> 02:46:17.660
what are you most looking forward to at E3 this year?

02:46:17.660 --> 02:46:21.860
Uh, Loki. Sleeping.

02:46:21.860 --> 02:46:25.700
You're just gonna sleep through E3?

02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:30.740
Sleeping after walking around during E3? Oh, I see.

02:46:30.740 --> 02:46:32.580
Honestly, you get tired.

02:46:32.580 --> 02:46:35.080
No, but, um, what I wanna see...

02:46:35.080 --> 02:46:37.580
I wanna see Sinbad being ignored again.

02:46:37.580 --> 02:46:42.180
Tell the Sinbad story for those new listeners.

02:46:42.180 --> 02:46:46.680
We saw Sinbad at E3 last year and he waved and, like, no one cared.

02:46:46.680 --> 02:46:47.740
Everyone was just like,

02:46:47.740 --> 02:46:49.340
Who's that guy? Who's that guy?

02:46:49.340 --> 02:46:51.540
It's Sinbad.

02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:53.780
Oh. He's not funny. Poor guy.

02:46:53.780 --> 02:46:55.520
Say, look at me!

02:46:55.520 --> 02:46:57.120
Hi!

02:46:57.120 --> 02:46:58.160
Hi?

02:46:58.160 --> 02:46:59.440
Hi?

02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:03.840
Oh, poor Sinbad.

02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:07.320
Well, what I'm most looking forward to at E3 this year is

02:47:07.320 --> 02:47:10.160
the fact that there's going to be DDR with Mario.

02:47:10.160 --> 02:47:12.360
I think that's going to be a fun game to check out.

02:47:12.360 --> 02:47:15.360
And I'm also looking forward to seeing what Nintendo turns

02:47:15.360 --> 02:47:17.520
out with the new Zelda and possibly a new console,

02:47:17.520 --> 02:47:18.420
possibly.

02:47:18.420 --> 02:47:21.640
And I'm looking forward to actually seeing progress on

02:47:21.640 --> 02:47:22.720
the Nintendo DS.

02:47:22.720 --> 02:47:24.880
I'm looking forward to that as well.

02:47:24.880 --> 02:47:25.560
Dark Sakura.

02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:28.800
I'm looking forward to ogling over the Marines.

02:47:28.800 --> 02:47:30.840
There will be lots of men in uniform.

02:47:30.840 --> 02:47:34.700
I'm expecting, I'm hoping this year with metrosexuality

02:47:34.700 --> 02:47:38.360
pushing more and more, as much as that word is stupid, pushing more and more into our culture,

02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:41.660
I'm looking for booth boys this year

02:47:41.660 --> 02:47:45.040
instead of booth babes. I want some booth boys this year.

02:47:45.040 --> 02:47:49.120
When I say boys, 18 and over please. With the general demographic of being

02:47:49.120 --> 02:47:52.640
neri,

02:47:52.640 --> 02:47:57.000
you know, late twenties. That's starting to be more and more bullshit though.

02:47:57.000 --> 02:48:00.080
women are started to play games more and more and more more more

02:48:00.080 --> 02:48:03.960
I mean that's been a long time coming right next thing you know they'll want to vote

02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:08.920
okay um honestly this is your cue to tear into them

02:48:08.920 --> 02:48:12.840
repeat please

02:48:12.840 --> 02:48:15.840
I can't ignore what he says

02:48:15.840 --> 02:48:18.840
allow me to repeat he said next thing you know

02:48:18.840 --> 02:48:24.040
they'll want to vote the ferrets haven't been unpacked yet sorry

02:48:24.040 --> 02:48:26.040
Oh shit.

02:48:26.040 --> 02:48:27.040
Oh, in fact, actually...

02:48:27.040 --> 02:48:28.040
That's more real on the floor.

02:48:28.040 --> 02:48:30.040
While you're at it, while you're at it, uh,

02:48:30.040 --> 02:48:33.040
Illusion had the answer to his question from earlier,

02:48:33.040 --> 02:48:35.040
why do women have breasts?

02:48:35.040 --> 02:48:37.040
He sent another message that says,

02:48:37.040 --> 02:48:38.040
the correct answer was,

02:48:38.040 --> 02:48:41.040
so you got something to look at when you're talking to them.

02:48:45.040 --> 02:48:46.040
Where's the webcam?

02:48:46.040 --> 02:48:49.040
The webcam's over there, but it's very dark.

02:48:49.040 --> 02:48:50.040
Fuck.

02:48:50.040 --> 02:48:53.040
I'm up here, not down there, now go away.

02:48:53.040 --> 02:48:56.040
That's it, mastectomy.

02:48:56.040 --> 02:48:59.400
And some women aren't just

02:48:59.400 --> 02:49:02.720
not up here and not down there, they're down a little bit lower.

02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:06.400
Those are people in their 60s.

02:49:06.400 --> 02:49:11.600
I don't look at grandma's breasts. That is the result of bra burning in the 70s.

02:49:11.600 --> 02:49:16.200
Honestly, yeah. What was the point of that?

02:49:16.200 --> 02:49:20.240
I mean, honestly, we aren't going to be considered by bras.

02:49:20.240 --> 02:49:27.520
oh yeah because they saw that as a symbol of of you know men keeping their

02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:31.520
fit on women but the whole thing bras are there to support your boobs so you're

02:49:31.520 --> 02:49:36.040
not saggy yeah I know some men that like to wear bras they're like they're like

02:49:36.040 --> 02:49:47.240
got to know they won't hold us back now spray us with that hose oh anyways I

02:49:47.240 --> 02:49:52.240
I gotta play the, you know, the sexist role on this show, you know, it's, it's...

02:49:52.240 --> 02:49:56.240
Oh, right, alright, the role, the, the role that you fit into.

02:49:56.240 --> 02:50:02.240
Okay, honestly, I've been talking to, you know, my fiancé, and she says that women are not bad drivers.

02:50:02.240 --> 02:50:10.240
But every time I see a goddamn, you know, crazy bitch on the road, it's always some stupid woman on her cellphone, driving an SUV.

02:50:10.240 --> 02:50:13.240
I can't help it if they keep her graduated stereotype.

02:50:13.240 --> 02:50:19.000
I got stuck behind an old man driving an SUV talking on his cell phone.

02:50:19.000 --> 02:50:21.440
Exactly. They fall into the old people category.

02:50:21.440 --> 02:50:23.440
Was he burning his bra?

02:50:23.440 --> 02:50:25.940
He was burning his pampers.

02:50:25.940 --> 02:50:29.240
I don't know. Whatever it is, the old man wear depends.

02:50:29.240 --> 02:50:31.840
Old men are nasty.

02:50:31.840 --> 02:50:36.440
By the way, my new roommate is looking in on the room right now,

02:50:36.440 --> 02:50:39.240
kind of going, what the hell are these people doing right now?

02:50:39.240 --> 02:50:41.240
Can we interview you, please? Please?

02:50:41.240 --> 02:50:42.540
Come be, give him a microphone.

02:50:42.540 --> 02:50:45.540
Don't you agree with mint-sucky driving?

02:50:45.540 --> 02:50:46.440
This is my new roommate.

02:50:46.440 --> 02:50:46.940
Say hello.

02:50:46.940 --> 02:50:47.440
Hello.

02:50:47.440 --> 02:50:50.840
And now you, how much DDR do you play?

02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:53.000
How familiar are you with DDR?

02:50:53.000 --> 02:50:58.120
Well, I just played the game that my sister bought the other week.

02:50:58.120 --> 02:51:01.320
Which is DDR Extreme on PS2.

02:51:01.320 --> 02:51:02.320
And it was fun.

02:51:02.320 --> 02:51:04.680
What do you think about the fact that your roommate does

02:51:04.680 --> 02:51:06.660
this crazy internet radio program?

02:51:06.660 --> 02:51:11.040
It's craziness with capital K.

02:51:11.040 --> 02:51:15.600
No I think it's cool. This is the first time I've seen you do it so it's cool.

02:51:15.600 --> 02:51:17.040
Are we nerds or what?

02:51:17.040 --> 02:51:18.880
Um, you're crazy nerds.

02:51:18.880 --> 02:51:22.560
I like that you're entertaining the guests out in the kitchen who have long since abandoned the show.

02:51:22.560 --> 02:51:23.760
So that's cool.

02:51:23.760 --> 02:51:25.840
Now tell them to keep it down out there. We're trying to do a show in here.

02:51:25.840 --> 02:51:28.560
Keep it down. Oh okay I'll go that way.

02:51:28.560 --> 02:51:33.520
Whoa what the hell was that noise? That was weird. Anyway sorry it must be interference.

02:51:34.480 --> 02:51:35.120
Whoa okay.

02:51:35.920 --> 02:51:36.480
Okay.

02:51:36.480 --> 02:51:37.200
All right well.

02:51:37.200 --> 02:51:38.400
All right well nice seeing you.

02:51:38.400 --> 02:51:41.320
Okay, get out of the room that you pay rent for. No, I'm just kidding

02:51:41.900 --> 02:51:43.900
No, but honestly, I

02:51:44.740 --> 02:51:49.980
Mean there are like I said, there are the slight few just like good Comcast cable, you know

02:51:49.980 --> 02:51:55.740
I said well when said the slight few people don't pull out in front of me in their taxi van

02:51:56.420 --> 02:51:58.900
Exactly. I think that this guy I was like

02:51:59.500 --> 02:52:04.820
And I ended up having to swim into the other lane and then I slid because of the freaking you know

02:52:04.820 --> 02:52:08.860
rain you know everyone knows the taxi drivers I've actually wanted to do that

02:52:08.860 --> 02:52:11.940
instead of actually honking my horn rolling down the window and sticking my

02:52:11.940 --> 02:52:15.180
head out and yelling beep beep because I think people would notice me more than

02:52:15.180 --> 02:52:25.340
as you hit something in your head is taking your left arm out extend your

02:52:25.340 --> 02:52:31.940
middle finger up anyways we totally like sidestep whatever that question was

02:52:31.940 --> 02:52:34.340
I'm going to post pictures of my car in the chatroom.

02:52:34.340 --> 02:52:36.260
Nintz has a question.

02:52:36.260 --> 02:52:38.380
Nintz says he's kind of stretching for a question here.

02:52:38.380 --> 02:52:39.880
Skip it if you've got a better one.

02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:40.900
Well, we don't.

02:52:40.900 --> 02:52:43.100
I'm going to be getting another 2DX game soon.

02:52:43.100 --> 02:52:45.540
So seventh style or eighth style?

02:52:45.540 --> 02:52:46.780
Eighth.

02:52:46.780 --> 02:52:49.140
Eighth.

02:52:49.140 --> 02:52:51.140
I say seventh.

02:52:51.140 --> 02:52:53.620
That's actually a toss-up, because I like what's on seventh.

02:52:53.620 --> 02:52:57.380
But I really like what's on eighth, so.

02:52:57.380 --> 02:52:58.220
Get sixth.

02:52:58.220 --> 02:53:00.420
Eighth.

02:53:00.420 --> 02:53:01.220
I like seventh.

02:53:01.220 --> 02:53:02.520
I'm going to be the lone holdup for 7th.

02:53:02.520 --> 02:53:04.740
Although, honestly, in 8th style, you get a lot of the

02:53:04.740 --> 02:53:05.780
good 7th style songs.

02:53:05.780 --> 02:53:08.380
But, but, but, but, beauty of silence, sound of goodbye.

02:53:08.380 --> 02:53:12.400
But, but, but, you know, that's just me.

02:53:12.400 --> 02:53:15.660
I don't play 2DX.

02:53:15.660 --> 02:53:17.580
Lastly, a question, because we didn't get

02:53:17.580 --> 02:53:18.380
any more other than this.

02:53:18.380 --> 02:53:19.700
Legend of Zaku has this.

02:53:19.700 --> 02:53:21.140
Oh, this is beautiful.

02:53:21.140 --> 02:53:23.500
After stumbling through the Aaron and Japan forums, I

02:53:23.500 --> 02:53:26.420
managed to find a thread that has what appears to be a link

02:53:26.420 --> 02:53:30.020
for a DDR movie in production.

02:53:30.020 --> 02:53:33.580
Here's the link of the story since the main site is down and then he gave a link here.

02:53:33.580 --> 02:53:36.980
What chances do you give this so-called movie in the works? So I looked at the

02:53:36.980 --> 02:53:38.180
link he gave you. Here it is.

02:53:38.180 --> 02:53:42.140
Dance Dance Revolution is the name of the popular video game created by the well-known

02:53:42.140 --> 02:53:43.520
game company Konami.

02:53:43.520 --> 02:53:47.740
The current team consists... Okay, right there, you know it's a fake.

02:53:47.740 --> 02:53:50.920
You can tell right... What is wrong with the first sentence that makes this a fake?

02:53:50.920 --> 02:53:54.940
Konami. It's not Konami.

02:53:54.940 --> 02:53:58.600
Oh. What? It says well-known game company Konami.

02:53:58.600 --> 02:54:02.040
Konami does much more than just video games. Much, much more than just video games.

02:54:02.040 --> 02:54:03.880
Remember? They create slot machines.

02:54:03.880 --> 02:54:06.600
Well, yeah, but primarily they're known for the video games.

02:54:06.600 --> 02:54:10.360
But I'm saying if this were an official press release, that wouldn't say that. I don't think.

02:54:10.360 --> 02:54:12.200
It would say something like game publishers or something like that.

02:54:12.200 --> 02:54:13.880
Either that or these people are just stupid.

02:54:13.880 --> 02:54:17.640
The current team consists of two members so far, and I'm not even going to read their names.

02:54:18.200 --> 02:54:20.600
Creator and directors. Two guys I've never heard of.

02:54:20.600 --> 02:54:23.640
We started Dance Dance Revolution the movie in 2005.

02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:29.000
All righty then, time for the storyline. 18-year-old Emi Toshiba's lifelong dream

02:54:29.000 --> 02:54:32.960
was to become a professional dancer. One day she sees a flyer on a liquor store's

02:54:32.960 --> 02:54:36.200
window announcing a dance contest. As she runs for the big-time winner with her

02:54:36.200 --> 02:54:40.240
partner Rage, they meet some new friends, rivals, and conflicts. As Emi is settling

02:54:40.240 --> 02:54:43.600
into her new surroundings, she and her new friends gradually become aware that

02:54:43.600 --> 02:54:48.200
not all is quite right in the contest. Something sinister is lurking deep in

02:54:48.200 --> 02:54:52.380
the shadows of the dancing stage. The movie is all about competition, love, and

02:54:52.380 --> 02:54:55.440
accepting others as they are so if you like drama comedy and DDR this is the

02:54:55.440 --> 02:55:00.220
movie for you the plans we're gonna produce the movie in 2007 or 2008

02:55:00.220 --> 02:55:04.460
depending on when we'll get enough money for the production depending on when we

02:55:04.460 --> 02:55:09.660
graduate from college you know it's not gonna happen that's like a plot of maybe

02:55:09.660 --> 02:55:17.140
an anime for it it sounds like any of rage liquor store

02:55:17.140 --> 02:55:18.500
I'd love to be a dancer!

02:55:18.500 --> 02:55:23.860
Ami, by the way, is gonna be played by a big-breasted Asian chick in order to sell tickets.

02:55:23.860 --> 02:55:24.500
I'll watch it.

02:55:24.500 --> 02:55:28.900
Honestly, I don't care what it's about, you can just get...

02:55:28.900 --> 02:55:32.740
Get that chick from BMX XXX, the one that

02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:37.300
strips down naked and is dressed up like a schoolgirl, that'll get me to see that movie.

02:55:37.300 --> 02:55:41.460
That's all you need to show is her dressed up like a schoolgirl stripping down naked

02:55:41.460 --> 02:55:44.980
in the trailer that will sell tickets.

02:55:44.980 --> 02:55:48.740
Hell, they should just make BMX XXX the movie. That would be better.

02:55:48.740 --> 02:55:53.540
Every six months, the topic of DDR the movie is coming up.

02:55:53.540 --> 02:55:56.740
Stop believing it!

02:55:56.740 --> 02:56:01.700
There's only one way this will happen. Until it is posted on IMDB or

02:56:01.700 --> 02:56:03.020
announced by a

02:56:03.020 --> 02:56:06.500
resp... what's the word? Reputable? Respectable?

02:56:06.500 --> 02:56:09.980
I don't know. Reputable has a reputation, right?

02:56:09.980 --> 02:56:14.780
One of the big five movie productions. You know who's gonna do this? Even if it's Lionsgate!

02:56:14.780 --> 02:56:18.420
wait for them to announce it you know who's gonna know why he's all bad

02:56:18.420 --> 02:56:22.200
you know I don't know why I'm not gonna know I am is I'm just gonna say I'm you

02:56:22.200 --> 02:56:23.180
know who would

02:56:23.180 --> 02:56:27.460
you would you know steep this no soup this low

02:56:27.460 --> 02:56:32.260
mmm evil he would

02:56:32.260 --> 02:56:35.460
he would do this because he is like ooh

02:56:35.460 --> 02:56:38.460
excuse to have another rave on an island

02:56:38.460 --> 02:56:42.660
that movie was so bad

02:56:42.660 --> 02:56:46.660
Didn't we talk a long time ago about possible plots for a DDR movie and we actually came

02:56:46.660 --> 02:56:47.660
up with something decent?

02:56:47.660 --> 02:56:49.660
I just don't remember what it was.

02:56:49.660 --> 02:56:51.660
I know that's very useful to you guys out there.

02:56:51.660 --> 02:56:52.660
10k commotion.

02:56:52.660 --> 02:56:55.580
Oh god, don't start on that again.

02:56:55.580 --> 02:56:57.020
That's another fanboy thing though.

02:56:57.020 --> 02:56:59.820
I mean with all due respect to the folks that created it.

02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:00.820
Come on.

02:57:00.820 --> 02:57:01.900
But here's the thing though.

02:57:01.900 --> 02:57:06.240
That's the only way that it would work and the whole focus of it is not really on DDR.

02:57:06.240 --> 02:57:10.260
They play DDR in it but it's not really, that's not really the focus of it.

02:57:10.260 --> 02:57:15.860
I like the setup that they do for like the tournament. The tournament setup was kind of cool. It made it look cool

02:57:15.860 --> 02:57:17.940
That's that's the only way that we would work

02:57:18.180 --> 02:57:22.960
None of this like because I I sense where they're going at this we're gonna use the DDR

02:57:23.180 --> 02:57:26.780
Characters and they're gonna discover evil robots and yeah

02:57:27.500 --> 02:57:28.780
No

02:57:28.780 --> 02:57:35.740
They're secret agents and then rage is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme and all hell breaks loose

02:57:35.740 --> 02:57:42.740
Please support TDR Edition.

02:57:42.740 --> 02:57:46.740
We'll resurrect Raul Julian and kill him off again.

02:57:46.740 --> 02:57:50.740
I think now would be a good time to end Ask Orange Lounge. What do you guys think?

02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:53.740
I think not.

02:57:53.740 --> 02:57:59.740
Actually I'm being linked to something in the channel. It is something that's on the Internet Movie Database.

02:57:59.740 --> 02:58:02.740
Let's see, I think this is what I think it is.

02:58:02.740 --> 02:58:10.100
link right now. It's in the chat. Yeah, Dance Dance Documentary. I don't know. It's something

02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:20.700
that folks... What is this? It's a DVD. It's a documentary. Eh, big deal. I mean, no offense.

02:58:20.700 --> 02:58:24.220
I think I was in one of these. I got interviewed for one of these. They wanted me to wear the

02:58:24.220 --> 02:58:27.600
Dr. Dick hat, the orange hat, and I wouldn't do it because I knew it was being made for

02:58:27.600 --> 02:58:31.960
a movie. I don't know if that's the one or if it was some other college project or something.

02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:35.120
there was a call for the clatter

02:58:35.120 --> 02:58:39.360
this isn't the same thing documentaries are one thing documentaries uh... you

02:58:39.360 --> 02:58:43.880
know a lot of people unfortunately don't see it's a lot of projects that you know

02:58:43.880 --> 02:58:47.920
i'm sure they're fine films but you know we're talking about like a fiction type

02:58:47.920 --> 02:58:48.940
a big budget

02:58:48.940 --> 02:58:49.640
basically

02:58:49.640 --> 02:58:50.720
movie here

02:58:50.720 --> 02:58:54.160
even a million dollars to be found out the game was going to actually be here's

02:58:54.160 --> 02:58:57.240
the problem with this whole uh... movie idea

02:58:57.240 --> 02:58:58.440
maybe like

02:58:58.440 --> 02:58:59.920
you know i

02:58:59.920 --> 02:59:01.040
fan movie

02:59:01.040 --> 02:59:19.040
possibly. Big budget movie? No, because even if it was, you know, even if DDR is like uber popular, it doesn't lend itself to a movie at all, and you can't make a movie. That's like Tetris the movie, and I know everyone likes playing that, you know, joking about that. It's impossible.

02:59:19.040 --> 02:59:26.040
You have to make a movie where DDR is an element, but not the main force behind it.

02:59:26.040 --> 02:59:32.040
Like, you could do a, I don't know, a buddy movie that somehow has DDR, like they go, they like to play DDR.

02:59:32.040 --> 02:59:34.040
Example. Here's an example.

02:59:34.040 --> 02:59:36.040
The Wizard.

02:59:36.040 --> 02:59:37.040
That's not an intentional-

02:59:37.040 --> 02:59:38.040
The Wizard was gay.

02:59:38.040 --> 02:59:39.040
Okay, that's not an-

02:59:39.040 --> 02:59:40.040
Hey!

02:59:40.040 --> 02:59:43.040
Okay, now that movie was good in the 80s.

02:59:43.040 --> 02:59:45.040
It's so bad.

02:59:45.040 --> 02:59:46.040
It did have Christian Slater.

02:59:46.040 --> 03:00:08.520
Okay, now granted, now that's the only way that this type of thing would work is where it's like an element of it, you know, but that's not the main storyline, you know, it's not just, oh, look at us, we're playing DDR all the time. I mean, like the wizard, they had some more crap, like that stupid kid like, California. I hated him. But yeah, something like that.

03:00:08.520 --> 03:00:09.480
And then they have the power glove.

03:00:10.240 --> 03:00:10.760
So bad.

03:00:10.800 --> 03:00:11.040
Yeah.

03:00:11.040 --> 03:00:17.040
That's the end of another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.

03:00:17.040 --> 03:00:21.040
Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Angel.

03:00:21.040 --> 03:00:23.040
Angel, your final thought.

03:00:23.040 --> 03:00:26.040
I've been too quiet this episode, I'm sorry.

03:00:26.040 --> 03:00:30.040
That's okay. Arcadian 42, your final thought.

03:00:30.040 --> 03:00:32.040
I'm gonna...

03:00:32.040 --> 03:00:34.040
Loki, your final thought.

03:00:34.040 --> 03:00:38.040
I'm not sexist or racist, I just play one on the radio.

03:00:38.040 --> 03:00:48.280
my final thought is air dark Sakura reject false icons and move out of your

03:00:48.280 --> 03:00:56.560
parents house and the final word of tonight's show goes to Loki

03:00:59.680 --> 03:01:06.760
that does it for another episode of orange lounge radio live orange lounge

I loved that! Oh, it was great!

03:03:32.760 --> 03:03:34.760
Well, it was pretty good. Well, it wasn't bad.

03:03:34.760 --> 03:03:36.760
Well, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though. It could have been a lot better.

03:03:36.760 --> 03:03:38.760
I didn't really like it. It was pretty terrible.

03:03:38.760 --> 03:03:45.760
Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:01.760 --> 03:04:05.760

03:04:05.760 --> 03:04:11.160

03:04:11.160 --> 03:04:15.080
