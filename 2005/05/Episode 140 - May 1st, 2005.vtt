09:30.051 --> 09:30.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, something like that.

09:31.032 --> 09:33.994
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, try this microphone, because for some reason this one's really quiet.

09:34.194 --> 09:34.775
[SPEAKER_29]: Can you hear me now?

09:35.095 --> 09:35.755
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, good.

09:36.116 --> 09:39.698
[SPEAKER_02]: That one I shouldn't use because it makes my voice too loud, but this one is just fine.

09:39.718 --> 09:41.140
[SPEAKER_30]: There we go.

09:41.460 --> 09:41.920

09:43.681 --> 09:44.022
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell?

09:44.682 --> 09:47.825
[SPEAKER_02]: I licked it, actually, because I do that to things that I believe are mine.

09:47.865 --> 09:49.186
[SPEAKER_02]: I lick them so nobody touches them.

09:49.206 --> 09:50.006
[SPEAKER_10]: You mark your territory?

09:50.127 --> 09:50.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

09:50.547 --> 09:52.549
[SPEAKER_02]: You know how when somebody asks, hey, can I have a bite of that?

09:52.569 --> 09:53.069
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, sure.

09:53.089 --> 09:54.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Still want one?

09:55.351 --> 09:56.612
[SPEAKER_02]: At least you didn't take a piss on it.

09:57.372 --> 09:58.393

09:58.453 --> 09:59.194

[SPEAKER_19]: I'm here.

10:07.320 --> 10:07.781
[SPEAKER_19]: Now what?

10:08.882 --> 10:09.262
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

10:09.542 --> 10:09.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what?

10:09.943 --> 10:10.363
[SPEAKER_02]: You tell me.

10:11.280 --> 10:11.780
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Ong!

10:12.321 --> 10:15.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Also joining us, say hello to the Ice Princess.

10:15.663 --> 10:16.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

10:16.364 --> 10:17.485
[SPEAKER_02]: God, we haven't seen you in forever.

10:18.482 --> 10:19.862
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, like, hi, I'm done, okay.

10:22.003 --> 10:24.144
[SPEAKER_29]: Queenie, as always, what can you say?

10:24.324 --> 10:27.625
[SPEAKER_29]: Usually when I stick something phallic in his face, he doesn't shy away from it.

10:27.885 --> 10:29.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, alright.

10:30.406 --> 10:33.587
[SPEAKER_02]: We're gonna go to a quick break after this break of some opening music.

10:34.367 --> 10:35.608
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot to talk about tonight.

10:36.268 --> 10:45.691
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, I want to apologize if there wasn't a new intro tonight, but I've just been very, very busy with, like, moving and the Lion King, because I went and saw Lion King today.

10:45.711 --> 10:46.111
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

10:47.481 --> 10:49.343
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw the Lion King, I can die now.

10:49.523 --> 10:51.905
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, question, Lion King came out years ago.

10:52.005 --> 10:54.608
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no, the play, stupid, the play.

10:55.809 --> 10:57.731
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, because of course, I knew there was a play.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.233
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh my god, crawl out of that hole you've been in.

11:01.114 --> 11:02.356
[SPEAKER_30]: Fine, fine.

11:02.616 --> 11:03.316
[SPEAKER_30]: Doesn't work with me.

11:03.977 --> 11:07.841
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll be back after this break.

11:08.061 --> 11:08.902
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh god, here he is.

11:10.373 --> 11:11.514
[SPEAKER_30]: We were wondering where you were.

11:11.714 --> 11:16.936
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, maybe you're fucking up... Oh, I'm sorry.

11:17.757 --> 11:18.397
[SPEAKER_30]: I'm sorry.

11:19.338 --> 11:20.538
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm not in a fucking good mood.

11:20.698 --> 11:21.339
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.

11:22.239 --> 11:22.759
[SPEAKER_25]: What's going on?

11:23.680 --> 11:24.960
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm fucking tired!

11:25.320 --> 11:28.742
[SPEAKER_08]: I was just asleep because I've been driving all goddamn weekend!

11:29.302 --> 11:30.483
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm so damn tired!

11:30.703 --> 11:32.724
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I get here... Oh, there's a parking!

11:32.764 --> 11:35.005
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just gonna park four fucking blocks away!

11:35.626 --> 11:36.366
[SPEAKER_09]: That'll be fun!

11:36.386 --> 11:38.287
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright, anyway, commercial break.

11:38.775 --> 11:40.135
[SPEAKER_30]: Yeah, we'll be back after this.

11:41.036 --> 11:43.097
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring some firsts!

11:43.497 --> 11:46.118
[SPEAKER_02]: Some DDR and Guitar Freaks and Keyboard Mania.

11:46.158 --> 11:47.158
[SPEAKER_02]: Some Bobani firsts!

11:47.958 --> 11:49.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Since it is the first episode in the new studio.

11:49.819 --> 11:50.679
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this.

12:28.132 --> 12:28.833
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks for watching!

14:32.811 --> 14:37.352
Bum Bum Fire, Bum Bum Fire, Bum Bum Fire Burning Fire It's the light through your life

15:18.828 --> 15:20.573
Thank you for watching!

15:46.872 --> 15:47.999
Thanks for watching!

17:02.908 --> 17:05.229
Thanks for watching!

17:47.575 --> 17:53.782
[SPEAKER_30]: Gaming Radio, so uncensored that even Tom Brokaw could get a job with us.

17:56.244 --> 17:57.605
[SPEAKER_30]: Orange Lounge Radio.

17:59.507 --> 18:02.971
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey guys, we're back here with more Orange Lounge Radio.

18:04.642 --> 18:06.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off in our brand new studio.

18:07.164 --> 18:11.347
[SPEAKER_02]: We picked up and moved the things from Folsom, and now we are in a town called Rancho Cordova.

18:11.387 --> 18:16.850
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all still Sacramento, so for those of you guys who are curious where we're at, we just moved down the freeway a little bit, that's all.

18:18.611 --> 18:24.635
[SPEAKER_02]: And I apologize because our audio levels are a little bit screwy tonight, and I really don't know the best way to fix them.

18:25.576 --> 18:30.980
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just going to kind of adjust them as we go along tonight, because I know it sounds a little weird.

18:31.020 --> 18:32.821
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I sound very amplified, I don't know.

18:33.516 --> 18:38.358
[SPEAKER_02]: You're always amped up I know Jamie sounds great I always sound great

18:39.373 --> 18:40.413
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe it was just the mics.

18:40.734 --> 18:46.936
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of played mic roulette, too, a little bit to try and bring some quiet people up and some loud people down, but now I'm, like, too loud.

18:47.316 --> 18:47.656
[SPEAKER_02]: It's weird.

18:48.336 --> 18:48.637
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

18:48.917 --> 18:49.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

18:49.057 --> 18:51.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Turn yourself down.

18:51.257 --> 18:51.878
[SPEAKER_02]: Which one am I?

18:52.018 --> 18:52.858
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know which one I am.

18:53.238 --> 18:54.219
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, hello, hello, hello.

18:54.299 --> 18:54.979
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I'm too quiet.

18:55.239 --> 18:55.679
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello!

18:55.699 --> 18:56.159
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops.

18:57.940 --> 18:59.160
[SPEAKER_20]: This is awesome radio.

18:59.360 --> 18:59.741
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.

19:00.141 --> 19:01.221
[SPEAKER_02]: Check, check, check.

19:01.281 --> 19:01.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, fine.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.162
[SPEAKER_02]: You're listening to mic check radio.

19:05.323 --> 19:05.503
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

19:06.563 --> 19:10.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine that, that we got nominated for that live 365 award thing.

19:10.590 --> 19:11.091
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them.

19:11.692 --> 19:13.234
[SPEAKER_02]: And the award show... Can I nominate you?

19:13.294 --> 19:14.797
[SPEAKER_02]: The award show was last night.

19:14.817 --> 19:15.618
[SPEAKER_27]: The name is what?

19:15.638 --> 19:15.818
[SPEAKER_27]: Ultraman?

19:15.838 --> 19:15.878
[SPEAKER_27]: No.

19:16.059 --> 19:18.543
[SPEAKER_27]: To retrieve my thermal container from the...

19:19.477 --> 19:21.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop distracting me over there.

19:22.118 --> 19:24.258
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were nominated for two Best of Life Use 5 awards.

19:24.278 --> 19:26.199
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the little shindig they had last night.

19:26.839 --> 19:30.180
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we looked pretty hot, I've got to say.

19:31.040 --> 19:32.060
[SPEAKER_02]: We were certainly unique.

19:32.361 --> 19:33.321
[SPEAKER_20]: I looked very drunk.

19:36.802 --> 19:38.322
[SPEAKER_02]: All these random people keep coming in here.

19:39.383 --> 19:43.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're trying to do radio.

19:48.170 --> 19:51.231
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just going to close my eyes so I can't see people keep coming into the studio.

19:53.031 --> 19:54.811
[SPEAKER_02]: The Best of Life 365 Awards were last night.

19:54.831 --> 19:55.692
[SPEAKER_02]: We went to the Shindig.

19:56.012 --> 19:58.212
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't win, but that's okay.

19:58.452 --> 20:10.474
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cool with it because, you know, when we looked at the chat room, because they actually had the chat room being projected on the nearby wall so we could see the chat and see people talking about, you know, the awards and stuff.

20:10.754 --> 20:14.095
[SPEAKER_02]: When we looked in the chat room, there was like six or seven people yelling, Oh, hello!

20:15.743 --> 20:17.587
[SPEAKER_02]: Just screaming little fanboys and fangirls.

20:18.007 --> 20:19.289
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was so cool to see.

20:19.410 --> 20:24.899
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really appreciate you guys that joined us there in spirit last night and were yelling things.

20:25.996 --> 20:28.759
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably offending other broadcasters, but that's okay.

20:29.119 --> 20:31.442
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them need their feathers ruffled a little bit, honestly.

20:32.503 --> 20:33.985
[SPEAKER_02]: But actually we met some very cool people.

20:34.145 --> 20:35.947
[SPEAKER_02]: We met some very awesome other broadcasters.

20:36.187 --> 20:36.667
[SPEAKER_19]: We sure did.

20:37.128 --> 20:38.609
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were very happy about that.

20:39.530 --> 20:45.076
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also met some, well we didn't really meet them, but we also saw some people that were kind of jerks.

20:45.216 --> 20:47.499
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had no idea how they were winning awards, but that's alright.

20:50.669 --> 20:51.830
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the nature of the business.

20:52.051 --> 20:52.752
[SPEAKER_02]: Them's the breaks.

20:53.773 --> 20:54.474
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had those.

20:54.634 --> 20:56.416
[SPEAKER_20]: And we will break them in the future.

20:57.037 --> 21:00.280
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had a good time, and thanks, you guys, for getting us nominated.

21:00.701 --> 21:03.524
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though we didn't win, it was still cool, and we'll just try again next year.

21:06.368 --> 21:07.569
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we're famous.

21:08.730 --> 21:12.533
[SPEAKER_02]: To anybody who saw us in the paper here recently and is tuning in because of it, welcome.

21:12.773 --> 21:15.275
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear our shows are usually not this disorganized.

21:15.695 --> 21:24.301
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's interesting because the article that ran in the Sacramento Bee, which is our local paper, pretty big paper around here, it talks about how we do the show every week in our Folsom apartment.

21:24.741 --> 21:28.464
[SPEAKER_02]: But when they interviewed us, it was like five weeks ago or so.

21:28.484 --> 21:29.344
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a little while ago.

21:30.105 --> 21:31.146
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've moved since then.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.647
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had to been dealing with all that.

21:33.347 --> 21:34.608
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not actually in Folsom anymore.

21:34.628 --> 21:35.549
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still in the Sacramento area.

21:36.634 --> 21:37.596
[SPEAKER_02]: But the story was very nice.

21:37.616 --> 21:38.497
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a very lovely article.

21:38.517 --> 21:39.538
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you guys think?

21:40.559 --> 21:41.100
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was nice.

21:42.221 --> 21:43.102
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice.

21:43.443 --> 21:44.384
[SPEAKER_20]: I was sort of in the shot.

21:47.978 --> 21:49.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

22:18.120 --> 22:21.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it just added to the excitement of this entire week, NBA.

22:22.102 --> 22:27.145
[SPEAKER_19]: He was the first comment on my live stream, he's like, I love how the only picture of me is above my foot, and I started laughing.

22:28.046 --> 22:28.686
[SPEAKER_19]: That was funny.

22:30.647 --> 22:38.252
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it would have been cool if they had actually put a picture that had him in it, but... Oh, that would have been nice, but no, that's never going to happen.

22:40.464 --> 22:45.248
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well, what we're going to do now, we're going to start off the show as we usually do, although we got some tangents there, but that's all right.

22:45.268 --> 22:46.609
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to talk about those things real quick.

22:46.629 --> 22:52.013
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be doing a little bit of how is your week, how is your day, where we go around and find out what's going on in people's lives.

22:52.573 --> 22:54.294
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I know everybody's got a lot to say.

22:54.354 --> 22:56.035
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't live last week.

22:56.096 --> 22:56.696
[SPEAKER_02]: We were taped.

22:56.736 --> 22:57.737
[SPEAKER_02]: We still had a new show.

22:58.517 --> 22:59.498
[SPEAKER_02]: My week was complete and utter shit.

22:59.518 --> 23:03.461
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I say complete and utter shit, the only way it could have been worse is if a house fell on my car, which I expected it to do on Friday.

23:03.541 --> 23:06.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesday, I actually got up in a really good mood.

23:06.704 --> 23:07.064
[SPEAKER_02]: I was all happy.

23:25.737 --> 23:29.238
[SPEAKER_20]: Go out and my trunk is open and my window is rolled down.

23:29.699 --> 23:36.881
[SPEAKER_20]: They stole the CD player out of my car, the fuckers, including a really good Gorillaz compilation CD that I put together to listen to in my car.

23:38.302 --> 23:42.643
[SPEAKER_20]: But they didn't take anything else, which I should be grateful for because my Bond CD was in my car too.

23:44.444 --> 23:48.666
[SPEAKER_20]: But it just, you know, it was sort of like the icing on the cake for me that day.

23:48.686 --> 23:52.907
[SPEAKER_20]: I was stressed out for school and I finally just ended up staying home that day because I was too stressed.

23:53.948 --> 23:54.388
[SPEAKER_20]: Next day.

23:55.305 --> 24:02.750
[SPEAKER_20]: I get in my car, I'm driving to work, and this guy driving a taxi van pulls out in front of me and I run into him.

24:04.023 --> 24:15.933
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, I have, um, pretty, uh, bad muscle contusion, which, um, in, like, normal people's terms is a big bad bruise around my hip, um, and a pinched nerve.

24:16.974 --> 24:23.179
[SPEAKER_20]: And now I'm on Vicodin, Flexerol, and 800 milligrams of Ibuprofen and lots of alcohol to make me feel better.

24:24.240 --> 24:24.320
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

24:26.942 --> 24:33.728
[SPEAKER_20]: I still need to find out, because it's totally not my fault, but I need to get the guy's insurance company to pay for the damages to my car.

24:33.848 --> 24:34.849
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't drive my car.

24:36.210 --> 24:42.276
[SPEAKER_20]: We can probably hammer the fender back into some kind of shape that I can drive it in now, although my alignment's a little bit off.

24:42.816 --> 24:46.520
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's not undriveable except the fact that the fender keeps rubbing against my right tire.

24:47.520 --> 24:48.441
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, nobody was hurt.

24:48.801 --> 24:58.224
[SPEAKER_20]: Um, well, I was hurt, but the other guy was nice, too, so I don't want to hear anyone saying, oh, well, that fucker this, or, you know, fuck him, because he was a nice guy.

24:58.384 --> 25:00.745
[SPEAKER_20]: He really was, and I feel bad for him, too.

25:01.205 --> 25:02.105
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, thank you.

25:02.125 --> 25:04.126
[SPEAKER_20]: I got a yay for me being on Vicodin again.

25:05.086 --> 25:09.228
[SPEAKER_20]: I do actually do pretty damn good writing when I'm on Vicodin, so maybe I'll start writing again.

25:10.308 --> 25:10.388
[SPEAKER_20]: Um...

25:13.143 --> 25:19.007
[SPEAKER_20]: And then it was just a whole bunch of just different crap.

25:19.027 --> 25:30.916
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's been a really weird weekend because I got made moderator on the Gorillas Unofficial Board, which is one of the big ones there, run by a really cool crew there.

25:32.097 --> 25:37.781
[SPEAKER_20]: I also... We went to the Live 365 Awards where...

25:40.951 --> 25:42.452
[SPEAKER_20]: We were going to go over that later.

25:42.772 --> 25:46.355
[SPEAKER_20]: I won something on the little bingo thing that I did.

25:46.915 --> 25:49.277
[SPEAKER_20]: I'll go over that later, too.

25:50.038 --> 25:54.441
[SPEAKER_20]: And something else good happened, but for the life of me, I can't remember what it is.

25:55.561 --> 25:58.424
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like I can't remember my life anymore unless I read my damn live journal.

25:59.945 --> 26:08.511
[SPEAKER_20]: Other than that, though, I've been a weird combination of either going from incredibly elated to just super depressed over everything, so...

26:09.426 --> 26:11.507
[SPEAKER_20]: If I'm in a weird mood, blame the Vicodin.

26:13.028 --> 26:14.908
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

26:14.928 --> 26:16.609
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, and I didn't play anything.

26:18.570 --> 26:20.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

26:20.471 --> 26:21.671
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Loki.

26:21.731 --> 26:22.211
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

26:22.251 --> 26:22.812
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

26:23.052 --> 26:23.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Dare I ask?

26:25.063 --> 26:28.186
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this last three weeks have sucked.

26:29.568 --> 26:30.669
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been just busy.

26:30.809 --> 26:32.450
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't actually had time to rest.

26:32.951 --> 26:37.516
[SPEAKER_02]: My new job's just stressful as hell, and I'm just tired.

26:38.597 --> 26:43.101
[SPEAKER_02]: Yesterday, I drove 200 miles to San Francisco.

26:43.542 --> 26:46.625
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, I drove 200 miles to Oakland.

26:47.626 --> 26:53.512
[SPEAKER_02]: And mind you, this was about seven hours after I drove to San Francisco and back.

26:54.973 --> 27:03.742
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got back today and I'm tired and just hungry because I haven't eaten that much today and yesterday and...

27:04.803 --> 27:05.803
[SPEAKER_02]: Just sucks.

27:05.984 --> 27:07.905
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this week is going to suck more.

27:07.925 --> 27:11.588
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just one big huge thing of suckage.

27:11.728 --> 27:16.071
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Comcast decided, you know, hey, we're not going to hook up the cable right.

27:16.151 --> 27:18.093
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, that didn't work all week.

27:18.173 --> 27:20.715
[SPEAKER_02]: So I couldn't actually play Final Fantasy XI or anything.

27:21.415 --> 27:22.256
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sucked.

27:22.816 --> 27:24.318
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can get back to that finally.

27:24.898 --> 27:27.800
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, what else?

27:28.421 --> 27:29.261
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

27:29.321 --> 27:30.743
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really much of anything.

27:30.763 --> 27:33.685
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Jonas didn't show up with food.

27:35.526 --> 27:39.047
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he was going to come tonight and bring food, and he's probably the only person in town that didn't show up tonight.

27:39.467 --> 27:39.987
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, though.

27:40.067 --> 27:44.989
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you make a commitment to bring food, goddammit, he better show up.

27:46.129 --> 27:47.470
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I count on this food.

27:49.210 --> 27:49.551
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

27:50.671 --> 27:52.171
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it sucked.

27:52.191 --> 27:56.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Today I got to hang out with Nelly's grandparents, who can't speak any English, in fact.

27:57.433 --> 27:59.634
[SPEAKER_02]: They go, we can't speak English.

27:59.774 --> 28:01.495
[SPEAKER_02]: And English was the first thing they said to me.

28:02.295 --> 28:02.955
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, okay.

28:03.296 --> 28:04.816
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all, you can't speak English?

28:05.817 --> 28:09.818
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they didn't know how to say, you know, can you speak Russian?

28:09.898 --> 28:11.319
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're like, you can't.

28:12.419 --> 28:13.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, can you speak English?

28:14.520 --> 28:16.821
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she kind of shook her head, like, no, that's not right.

28:17.141 --> 28:17.341
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

28:17.361 --> 28:19.682
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, ah, wrong words!

28:21.003 --> 28:23.324
[SPEAKER_02]: And then she, oh, that was interesting.

28:23.344 --> 28:24.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris?

28:24.524 --> 28:25.024
[SPEAKER_02]: Tetris?

28:28.903 --> 28:33.884
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not the international... It's the international game of peace, didn't you know?

28:34.664 --> 28:39.226
[SPEAKER_02]: You should have whipped out your copy of Tetris and been all, Do you understand, Tetris?

28:40.106 --> 28:43.947
[SPEAKER_02]: No, instead I played Ridge Racer and it's getting goddamn hard now.

28:44.207 --> 28:51.749
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you beat Pro Circuit 18, that's pretty much the actual official end of the game.

28:52.109 --> 28:54.369
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there on, it's all really hard shit.

28:55.470 --> 28:57.150
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got to beat the devil car today.

28:57.899 --> 29:01.101
[SPEAKER_02]: That sucked, because it just uses nitros constantly.

29:01.581 --> 29:05.203
[SPEAKER_02]: But I rock, and I beat it four times, so I eventually got that.

29:05.623 --> 29:09.165
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I unlocked the Super Rally X car, which is all pixelated.

29:09.565 --> 29:10.846
[SPEAKER_02]: It has blocky wheels.

29:11.286 --> 29:11.806
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.

29:12.427 --> 29:13.287
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got that, too.

29:13.467 --> 29:13.927
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fun.

29:14.248 --> 29:15.528
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a comment from the chatroom.

29:17.409 --> 29:19.731
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangelandradio.com Click on chat.

29:19.771 --> 29:23.232
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku says, Loki, I dare you to take some of Jamie's Vicodin.

29:24.613 --> 29:26.234
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't swallow pills, so no.

29:27.256 --> 29:32.040
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom Yeah, she's shouting no from the bathroom

29:46.212 --> 29:52.854
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I said to myself, because I was exhausted, you know, after driving all day and just, it just sucked.

29:53.354 --> 29:56.015
[SPEAKER_02]: So I laid down, like, I'm just going to lay down for a second.

29:56.616 --> 30:04.358
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom calls me at like 6.15, says, hey, you know, she's trying to talk to me about the newspaper article because I left a message for her.

30:04.378 --> 30:06.319
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh shit, I got to go.

30:06.339 --> 30:08.800
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm supposed to be at the show already.

30:09.440 --> 30:09.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn it.

30:10.421 --> 30:17.446
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I get here, I have to park way the fuck down the road, and for some reason I thought Rob's apartment number was like something else than it was.

30:17.466 --> 30:20.088
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm walking around going, where the fuck is it?

30:20.188 --> 30:21.929
[SPEAKER_02]: All these goddamn buildings look the same!

30:22.509 --> 30:23.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this sucks!

30:23.410 --> 30:24.911
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in total suburban apartment.

30:24.931 --> 30:27.613
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I walk down to the end, I'm like, okay, count the buildings.

30:29.154 --> 30:30.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay, here we go, here we go.

30:30.948 --> 30:32.809
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so, yeah, but that sucked.

30:36.232 --> 30:37.033
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just tired.

30:37.293 --> 30:38.073
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really tired.

30:38.093 --> 30:50.262
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we'll get into that all later, you know, about all the wonderful things that you encounter while driving, long distances, mainly bad drivers, you know, all that to come later on.

30:50.783 --> 30:51.123
[SPEAKER_02]: Lovely.

30:51.643 --> 30:51.963
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

30:52.584 --> 30:53.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Who else is in here?

30:53.324 --> 30:56.547
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go over to Arcadian42 who joined us, snuck in there a little bit.

30:56.587 --> 30:57.107
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

30:57.127 --> 30:58.048
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day, sir?

30:59.166 --> 31:02.007
[SPEAKER_26]: Last week I went to Jamie's party that was last Saturday.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.807
[SPEAKER_26]: It was pretty fun to go down there.

31:04.747 --> 31:09.028
[SPEAKER_26]: To MGL and Dave and Buster's.

31:09.048 --> 31:10.569
[SPEAKER_26]: They didn't go until since last year.

31:11.329 --> 31:12.269
[SPEAKER_26]: Played games and stuff like that.

31:12.689 --> 31:14.210
[SPEAKER_26]: Most of this week was just work.

31:15.330 --> 31:18.711
[SPEAKER_26]: Getting prepared for our boat loss to go to Europe for three weeks.

31:20.751 --> 31:22.132
[SPEAKER_26]: And so that was that.

31:23.092 --> 31:27.393
[SPEAKER_26]: Other than that, on Friday I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, which is a pretty good movie.

31:28.033 --> 31:28.353
[SPEAKER_26]: It was a

31:28.783 --> 31:31.945
[SPEAKER_26]: That was a very good adaption of the books.

31:33.806 --> 31:37.269
[SPEAKER_26]: Sort of draws from all the books, but mostly, of course, follows the first one.

31:38.510 --> 31:42.332
[SPEAKER_26]: And then yesterday didn't do much, and today didn't do much, and game here.

31:44.754 --> 31:49.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's go over to Ice Queen, if he can take a minute away from PictoChat.

31:49.557 --> 31:50.298
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week, how was your day?

31:50.928 --> 31:53.209
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it was just wonderfully entertaining.

31:54.369 --> 31:57.610
[SPEAKER_22]: Actually, the past three weeks have been, you know, pretty much wonderfully entertaining.

31:58.251 --> 32:05.713
[SPEAKER_22]: I have, in the last three weeks, spent over $1,000 on my truck, that piece of shit that has no grill, whatever you call it, on the front.

32:06.213 --> 32:10.115
[SPEAKER_22]: So you look at the front of the truck and you see the radiator, which is absolutely lovely.

32:11.195 --> 32:15.456
[SPEAKER_22]: After that, I pretty much just have been working.

32:15.837 --> 32:16.617
[SPEAKER_22]: Lovely new job.

32:17.495 --> 32:20.536
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm a paper pusher for 10 bucks an hour, woohoo.

32:23.416 --> 32:24.376
[SPEAKER_22]: Other than that, not much.

32:24.516 --> 32:28.157
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh yeah, I decided to try to get clever with my computer.

32:28.517 --> 32:33.698
[SPEAKER_22]: It's had some viruses on there that aren't being detected and fixed by the Norton antivirus.

32:34.038 --> 32:45.461
[SPEAKER_22]: So I went in there on Friday night and followed an online chat, or an online FAQ regarding how to fix this specific virus, the isass.exe.

32:46.141 --> 32:46.781
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, and...

32:47.888 --> 33:00.237
[SPEAKER_22]: Not knowing any better, the fact told me that I should go ahead and go into the safe mode under administrator and change the permissions for the user to deny.

33:00.938 --> 33:17.010
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, me not being any more aware than I was, I went ahead and did that, which then locked up all of my Windows files, no longer had access to explorer.exe as the process, so I have no desktop, had no start menu.

33:17.873 --> 33:23.014
[SPEAKER_22]: and I had no access to the MS config feature, which would not allow me to go back in and change my permissions.

33:23.054 --> 33:27.515
[SPEAKER_22]: So I spent the whole weekend pretty much just going through my computer.

33:28.736 --> 33:29.696
[SPEAKER_22]: Neil, you are a dork.

33:30.936 --> 33:37.198
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, I went through and actually Neil helped me out quite a bit, did most of the work.

33:37.238 --> 33:40.779
[SPEAKER_22]: He went in, added the software back in there and got everything working again.

33:40.819 --> 33:46.660
[SPEAKER_22]: So now I'm just waiting on the operating system to load back up and hopefully I'll have my computer

33:47.589 --> 33:49.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, and yeah, World of Warcraft.

33:49.450 --> 33:50.390
[SPEAKER_22]: I started playing that.

33:50.430 --> 33:51.490
[SPEAKER_22]: That game rocks.

33:52.110 --> 33:57.872
[SPEAKER_22]: It's better than Final Fantasy XI, only because you can actually solo and not have to worry about it.

33:58.592 --> 33:59.553
[SPEAKER_22]: So yes, it does.

33:59.613 --> 34:00.933
[SPEAKER_22]: Brad said that doesn't make a game better.

34:01.493 --> 34:02.053
[SPEAKER_22]: Oh, it does.

34:02.494 --> 34:03.214
[SPEAKER_22]: I am antisocial.

34:03.234 --> 34:03.814
[SPEAKER_22]: I hate people.

34:04.594 --> 34:06.575
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm still waiting for Ragnarok 2.

34:07.355 --> 34:12.157
[SPEAKER_29]: Then it makes the game more suited for you, because other people like to play multiplayer.

34:12.197 --> 34:16.618
[SPEAKER_29]: The only games suited for antisocial people are those that are offline.

34:18.522 --> 34:19.803
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, you mean just all other video games?

34:20.023 --> 34:20.223
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes.

34:21.063 --> 34:21.303
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

34:21.384 --> 34:25.205
[SPEAKER_20]: You can play Ragnarok Online completely antisocial, because I leveled myself into the 80s.

34:25.446 --> 34:25.626
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

34:25.726 --> 34:26.186
[SPEAKER_29]: By myself.

34:26.326 --> 34:30.208
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, Ragnarok Online's the ultimate solo online RPG.

34:32.449 --> 34:38.792
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know, actually, this Guild Wars game everybody's been talking about sounds like a very solo-friendly game.

34:39.073 --> 34:40.713
[SPEAKER_20]: The Blue Burst beta will be out in a few weeks.

34:41.814 --> 34:43.615
[SPEAKER_29]: But do we get to play Blue Burst?

34:44.575 --> 34:44.956
[SPEAKER_20]: No, US beta.

34:46.021 --> 34:47.683
[SPEAKER_29]: Do we have to pay monthly fees to play it?

34:47.883 --> 34:48.483
[SPEAKER_20]: Not for the beta.

34:48.944 --> 34:49.084
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh.

34:49.784 --> 34:50.065
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay.

34:50.385 --> 34:51.126
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, anyway.

34:52.627 --> 34:53.207
[SPEAKER_29]: What are you doing?

34:53.227 --> 34:56.010
[SPEAKER_29]: You're sitting there playing as DS, and you should be doing a radio show.

34:56.791 --> 34:58.892
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to join the PictoChat orgy, so shoot me.

34:58.932 --> 34:59.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, don't go anywhere.

34:59.653 --> 35:00.033
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your week?

35:00.053 --> 35:00.514
[SPEAKER_02]: How was your day?

35:00.654 --> 35:01.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you still?

35:02.596 --> 35:03.336
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, fabulous.

35:04.337 --> 35:07.400
[SPEAKER_29]: Um, no, it's been kind of sucky, uh,

35:08.760 --> 35:18.143
[SPEAKER_29]: Me and the Rice Princess both have jobs now, and it's kind of hard to, when you only have one vehicle, to get everybody where they need to go.

35:18.223 --> 35:28.226
[SPEAKER_29]: So we've been looking for a car, and every single time we go to go check out a car, it is apparent within a few minutes that the people do not know what they're talking about and do not know how to take care of their vehicles.

35:28.907 --> 35:30.567
[SPEAKER_29]: So, yeah.

35:31.868 --> 35:32.528
[SPEAKER_29]: So far, no luck.

35:34.391 --> 35:36.392
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, I went and saw Hitchhiker's Guide also today.

35:36.992 --> 35:37.733
[SPEAKER_29]: We both went and saw it.

35:38.373 --> 35:38.893
[SPEAKER_29]: And it was good.

35:39.213 --> 35:39.533
[SPEAKER_29]: Liked it.

35:41.374 --> 35:44.355
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's a sci-fi movie for even non-sci-fi fans.

35:44.775 --> 35:45.716
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, even they would like it.

35:46.316 --> 35:48.677
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorite part, and it's a big spoiler.

35:49.537 --> 35:50.498
[SPEAKER_29]: I feel like a sofa.

35:50.538 --> 35:51.318
[SPEAKER_29]: I think I'm a sofa.

35:53.699 --> 35:55.980
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's pretty funny, but I love the whale.

35:56.360 --> 35:58.181
[SPEAKER_29]: Yes, yes, the whale.

35:58.221 --> 35:58.941
[SPEAKER_29]: It's not a spoiler.

36:01.007 --> 36:04.488
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, no, I doubt anybody, like, not many, many people have read this book.

36:04.508 --> 36:06.129
[SPEAKER_29]: It's kind of a cult thing.

36:07.249 --> 36:07.449
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

36:07.469 --> 36:10.290
[SPEAKER_19]: A bunch of people have read Hedgehog, Crash Guard.

36:10.470 --> 36:18.113
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like, but, when you say a bunch of people have read it, it's like, nothing compared to, like, how many people have read the Bible.

36:18.753 --> 36:29.257
[SPEAKER_29]: You know, just because, like, a few thousand people here and there have read a book, that may be more than I have ever met in my life, but hey, it's... Yeah, it's not a huge thing, so, whatever.

36:30.751 --> 36:35.956
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to share with the chat room that they're not the only ones who feel like they have not seen the movie because I have not seen the movie.

36:36.176 --> 36:37.858
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't feel too left out, you guys.

36:38.438 --> 36:39.259
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll see it eventually.

36:39.519 --> 36:40.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see Kung Fu Hustle?

36:41.461 --> 36:41.942
[SPEAKER_25]: Oh my god!

36:42.042 --> 36:43.143
[SPEAKER_25]: Go see Kung Fu Hustle now!

36:43.904 --> 36:51.170
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, if I had to choose between movies to see, the one I went and saw, The Hitchhiker's Guide, I would have rather seen Kung Fu Hustle.

36:51.931 --> 36:54.894
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I haven't seen Kung Fu Hustle yet, but I saw Hitchhiker's Guide and...

36:55.692 --> 36:58.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Kung Fu Hustle's friggin' awesome.

36:58.375 --> 36:59.356
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I want to see?

36:59.877 --> 37:03.561
[SPEAKER_02]: What I would like to see is not paying $10 to go to a goddamn movie.

37:03.661 --> 37:04.462
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I would like to see.

37:04.602 --> 37:05.523
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't pay for it.

37:05.623 --> 37:06.544
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you need to do that.

37:06.564 --> 37:11.950
[SPEAKER_29]: You just go find the attractive-looking gay guy at the movie theater place and just say, Hey...

37:13.423 --> 37:15.984
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because that's the universal mating call, you know.

37:16.344 --> 37:19.085
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?

37:19.866 --> 37:25.368
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, my week and my day, it's just been very busy with all the moving stuff that's going on.

37:27.568 --> 37:28.549
[SPEAKER_02]: What more can be said?

37:28.689 --> 37:36.632
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so busy, but I'm so happy to have it all done, and I'm finally moved in here, and I'm getting comfortable in here and all that, and

37:37.799 --> 37:43.504
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, things will settle down, and then E3 is just around the corner, and then we get to go into panic mode again, so that should be exciting.

37:44.024 --> 37:44.765
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.

37:45.926 --> 37:46.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

37:47.107 --> 37:53.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what we're going to do now, and I'm still adjusting the sound levels, kind of as we go along here, so I apologize.

37:54.472 --> 37:55.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this my mic here?

37:56.014 --> 37:56.354
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

37:57.315 --> 37:58.496
[SPEAKER_25]: Maybe you should figure it out.

37:59.116 --> 37:59.597
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

37:59.757 --> 38:00.598
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so lost.

38:00.698 --> 38:08.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, what we're going to do now is we're going to take a break and we're going to play some new poppin' music during this break.

38:09.028 --> 38:09.789
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brand new.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.070
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't played this on the station yet.

38:11.471 --> 38:12.432
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Poppin' Music 12.

38:13.988 --> 38:18.469
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's really Papa Music Iroha, but it's just freaking Papa Music 12.

38:18.509 --> 38:22.690
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just trying to give it new names so that you'll forget that there's so damn many of these games.

38:23.130 --> 38:23.830
[SPEAKER_02]: Like 2DX.

38:24.190 --> 38:26.331
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but there's a lot of good music in this one.

38:27.871 --> 38:31.852
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting off with a remix of Star Mine, it's pretty interesting, so I'm going to start off with that.

38:31.992 --> 38:34.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Also in this, you're going to hear some new Akira Yamaoka.

38:35.353 --> 38:40.594
[SPEAKER_02]: A remix of the theme from Goemon is in here, and then a new Good Cool song is in here as well.

38:41.015 --> 38:42.635
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to hear all that during this break.

38:43.235 --> 38:51.436
[SPEAKER_02]: and we'll be back with more Orange Lounge Radio Orange Lounge Radio

Thanks for watching!

Thanks for watching!

42:44.724 --> 42:45.344
[SPEAKER_17]: Goyodam!

42:45.604 --> 42:45.984
[SPEAKER_17]: Goyodam!

43:38.032 --> 43:39.313
Thank you for watching.

44:20.131 --> 44:21.369
Thanks for watching!

45:55.081 --> 45:56.349
[SPEAKER_06]: Subtitles by the Amara.org community

46:33.577 --> 46:39.381
[SPEAKER_01]: Please listen to Orange Lounge Radio Because real radio makes Captain Jack cry

46:43.834 --> 46:44.514
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio

47:02.435 --> 47:03.556
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

47:23.158 --> 47:23.618
[SPEAKER_02]: Move this way.

47:23.658 --> 47:24.599
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, don't hit the wall.

47:24.639 --> 47:25.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't do it.

47:25.179 --> 47:27.201
[SPEAKER_20]: I greatly appreciate the presence of the chair in here.

47:27.321 --> 47:27.661
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.

47:27.701 --> 47:29.262
[SPEAKER_02]: And then behind DarkSakura.

47:29.282 --> 47:33.064
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, she doesn't let us put her on the webcam, so we can't really show you, but maybe we'll take a picture or something later.

47:33.404 --> 47:37.667
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can see the Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back poster that says, All you motherfuckers are going to pay.

47:37.707 --> 47:38.708
[SPEAKER_02]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

47:38.968 --> 47:42.310
[SPEAKER_02]: We have that right behind Jamie's chair, appropriately enough, I think, for her.

47:42.630 --> 47:44.611
[SPEAKER_20]: You are the ones who are the ball lickers.

47:44.751 --> 47:45.171
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

47:46.552 --> 47:51.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, so during the break there, we were listening to some music from the new pop and music, Uroha.

47:51.755 --> 47:52.296
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

47:54.383 --> 47:54.943
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

47:55.323 --> 47:55.924
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

47:55.964 --> 47:57.825
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucked.

47:58.245 --> 47:59.545
[SPEAKER_02]: The Starmine remix, you guys didn't like it?

48:00.386 --> 48:01.566
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was cute.

48:02.247 --> 48:03.087
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think it's that bad.

48:04.548 --> 48:05.508
[SPEAKER_29]: I didn't hear the Starmine one.

48:05.528 --> 48:06.469
[SPEAKER_29]: I only saw the Goemon one.

48:07.069 --> 48:07.289
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

48:07.529 --> 48:08.870
[SPEAKER_02]: The Goemon one was excellent.

48:08.890 --> 48:10.450
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of the Kiriyamaoka track?

48:10.751 --> 48:11.851
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two of them in pop music.

48:11.891 --> 48:12.311
[SPEAKER_02]: I played one.

48:14.632 --> 48:17.714
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that second song that played in between the Goemon and the first one.

48:18.854 --> 48:20.375
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the other one, not Ryusei Honey.

48:20.743 --> 48:29.066
[SPEAKER_29]: I couldn't pass that song for the longest time because of the crack baby I had to have somebody hold a towel over the video and then I could pass it

48:49.608 --> 48:50.549
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura

49:20.922 --> 49:21.162
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah.

49:21.262 --> 49:22.323
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, unless you're in the play.

49:23.024 --> 49:24.065
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, unless you're in the play.

49:24.686 --> 49:27.448
[SPEAKER_29]: I think it's bugging the hell out of you just because you can actually hear your voice now.

49:27.969 --> 49:30.191
[SPEAKER_30]: It's different, and I don't like different things.

49:30.311 --> 49:31.192
[SPEAKER_30]: That's my problem.

49:32.333 --> 49:33.374
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you, you're different.

49:33.434 --> 49:33.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out.

49:34.615 --> 49:35.256
[SPEAKER_29]: Let's beat him up.

49:35.296 --> 49:35.797
[SPEAKER_29]: He's different.

49:38.059 --> 49:38.319
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

49:38.639 --> 49:40.101
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not wearing a silly hat.

49:41.033 --> 49:42.314
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura's birthday party

50:03.167 --> 50:09.996
[SPEAKER_02]: But we went over to Milpitas Golf Land to play and I saw Drum Mania V and I was like, hey, it's Drum Mania and I fucking suck at it, so I'm gonna go over here to Guitar Freaks.

50:10.297 --> 50:13.842
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even bother to check out V. So, how is the V series?

50:13.882 --> 50:14.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't even really looked at it.

50:15.754 --> 50:19.957
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, I only really got one play in because I was running low on time there.

50:20.218 --> 50:25.382
[SPEAKER_29]: So I only got one play at Guitar Freaks V. They didn't have Drum Mania V at our golf land up here in Roseville.

50:26.883 --> 50:28.364
[SPEAKER_29]: So that's unfortunate.

50:29.025 --> 50:30.446
[SPEAKER_29]: I prefer Drum Mania over Guitar Freaks.

50:30.466 --> 50:30.866
[SPEAKER_29]: So whatever.

50:30.926 --> 50:32.808
[SPEAKER_29]: I got to play one game of Guitar Freaks V.

50:33.448 --> 50:38.611
[SPEAKER_29]: The song selection, I think, is better than some of the previous ones.

50:38.831 --> 50:44.415
[SPEAKER_29]: Because to me, after Guitar Freaks 5, the song selection has kind of gone downhill.

50:44.475 --> 50:47.776
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, when they got rid of... Was it...

50:49.458 --> 50:50.258
[SPEAKER_29]: Haru's Spring

51:06.773 --> 51:08.154
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's good.

51:08.514 --> 51:10.475
[SPEAKER_29]: The videos are definitely nice.

51:10.715 --> 51:17.139
[SPEAKER_29]: They added that nice quality full motion video and things like that that was in 2DX.

51:17.699 --> 51:21.181
[SPEAKER_29]: That's nice, but you don't really have time to sit there and look at the videos when you're playing the game.

51:21.301 --> 51:27.365
[SPEAKER_29]: So it's not really a very interesting new addition or useful addition.

51:27.825 --> 51:31.229
[SPEAKER_29]: Other than that, you know, it seems like it's pretty much just the same old Guitar Freaks.

51:31.269 --> 51:45.645
[SPEAKER_29]: It's got, looks like the resolution looks higher, you know, it looks more clear, so you're looking at the notes, look like they scroll smoother, and it's like the fifth mix of Guitar Freaks, basically, like GDR fifth mix, you know, how they added that.

51:46.486 --> 51:48.188
[SPEAKER_29]: I mean, but other than that, it's no real big

51:48.632 --> 51:57.240
[SPEAKER_29]: Woo-ha, wow, awesome new Guitar Freaks, so... I'll have to go check out the Drum Mania V first before I can give my final answer.

51:57.260 --> 51:58.121
[SPEAKER_29]: Because I want to play a session.

51:58.161 --> 51:59.522
[SPEAKER_29]: I haven't played a session in a long time.

52:01.584 --> 52:02.205
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, what's up with that?

52:02.225 --> 52:08.310
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, Golfland and all those places don't really have, like, the session mode like they used to, and the session was so cool when they had it, and now it's gone.

52:09.231 --> 52:14.516
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, they really should get a Keyboard Mania V to go with the Guitar Freaks Drum Mania, because...

52:15.165 --> 52:18.307
[SPEAKER_29]: The Keyboard Mania may not have been nearly as popular as the other games.

52:19.047 --> 52:21.048
[SPEAKER_29]: It was fun to have the four-person session.

52:21.248 --> 52:22.809
[SPEAKER_29]: That was always good times.

52:23.990 --> 52:25.251
[SPEAKER_20]: I still want Sax Mania.

52:26.091 --> 52:27.352
[SPEAKER_29]: Sax Mania, oh yeah.

52:28.432 --> 52:28.892
[SPEAKER_29]: Or what was it?

52:28.913 --> 52:29.533
[SPEAKER_20]: Sax Freaks.

52:29.613 --> 52:30.393
[SPEAKER_29]: What was the other one?

52:30.453 --> 52:32.975
[SPEAKER_29]: It was the Head Mania?

52:33.775 --> 52:35.156
[SPEAKER_29]: The pole that you just, yeah, anyway.

52:35.666 --> 52:36.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Sax Machine.

52:37.527 --> 52:37.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

52:38.607 --> 52:45.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, I know you're big on the Guitar Freaks and Drum Mania series, so I'm curious, you at Milpitas Golf Line got to check out Drum Mania Vs, so I'm kind of curious what you thought.

52:47.031 --> 52:49.232
[SPEAKER_26]: That's pretty much similar, it seems.

52:50.292 --> 52:53.454
[SPEAKER_26]: I didn't really notice the videos or anything, just because I wasn't really looking at them.

52:53.494 --> 52:55.194
[SPEAKER_26]: I was looking through the song list.

52:55.214 --> 52:56.655
[SPEAKER_26]: Song list seems pretty good.

52:57.355 --> 53:02.277
[SPEAKER_26]: I noticed there was a lot of older songs that they brought back from various older mixes.

53:02.978 --> 53:03.458
[SPEAKER_26]: So, like,

53:04.167 --> 53:06.908
[SPEAKER_26]: Void, and what was the other one I really noticed?

53:08.468 --> 53:09.208
[SPEAKER_26]: Crap, I can't remember.

53:09.348 --> 53:10.949
[SPEAKER_26]: Wild Ride, which only showed up in one.

53:10.969 --> 53:14.630
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like a special track in one of them that only showed up in that one.

53:14.650 --> 53:15.850
[SPEAKER_26]: It was like seventh mix, I think.

53:17.951 --> 53:19.651
[SPEAKER_26]: And, yeah, it seemed pretty good.

53:20.391 --> 53:24.292
[SPEAKER_26]: The way they do the song select, it only shows like five or six songs at a time.

53:24.312 --> 53:27.813
[SPEAKER_26]: It makes it harder to see what songs are in it, so that was probably the bad thing about it.

53:29.194 --> 53:30.574
[SPEAKER_26]: But otherwise, it seemed pretty cool.

53:31.806 --> 53:39.134
[SPEAKER_26]: I'd have to play it more, because I only played it twice, and then we had to run off to Dave & Buster's, so I didn't get to have that much chance to play it.

53:39.415 --> 53:45.742
[SPEAKER_26]: I haven't been to Roseville Golf Land in like two months, so I can't really comment on Guitar Freaks V yet.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.225
[SPEAKER_26]: But, yeah, it seemed all right.

53:50.662 --> 53:57.744
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is that while you guys were checking out V, I was actually checking out 11th Mix of Guitar Freaks finally for the first time.

53:58.264 --> 54:03.766
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun, it's very pink, but you know, I had a good time and I played it, so you know, what can I say.

54:03.886 --> 54:06.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you check out any of those Guitar Freaks, Guitar Mania?

54:06.846 --> 54:07.567
[SPEAKER_02]: I played Beat Mania.

54:08.087 --> 54:08.847
[SPEAKER_02]: You were playing Beat Mania?

54:09.087 --> 54:09.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Beat Mania the final?

54:10.007 --> 54:10.187
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:10.307 --> 54:11.328
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that the first time you checked that out?

54:11.768 --> 54:11.908
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

54:12.228 --> 54:12.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

54:12.508 --> 54:12.628
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

54:13.308 --> 54:18.210
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, one game, though, I want to kind of transition to this topic because there was another game you got to check out for the first time.

54:18.230 --> 54:18.650
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, God.

54:19.670 --> 54:20.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell us about it.

54:20.490 --> 54:22.451
[SPEAKER_20]: I played the retard game, I mean, in the groove.

54:23.851 --> 54:25.732
[SPEAKER_02]: And no holds barred from you, apparently.

54:27.093 --> 54:27.973
[SPEAKER_20]: It had good music.

54:28.553 --> 54:30.814
[SPEAKER_20]: Everything else about it was utter and complete ripoff.

54:31.214 --> 54:34.535
[SPEAKER_20]: I also don't like that you can't go backwards in the menus.

54:35.091 --> 54:39.813
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized that for the first time as well the other day when I fucked one of my modifiers severely.

54:39.913 --> 54:40.834
[SPEAKER_02]: I could not go back.

54:41.414 --> 54:45.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless there's a way you do it differently than DDR, but I figured everything else was the same as DDR.

54:46.236 --> 54:48.978
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way you would move back would be the same, and it doesn't work.

54:49.198 --> 54:49.998
[SPEAKER_29]: It was just really stupid.

54:50.018 --> 54:50.759
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's how you go back.

54:50.799 --> 54:52.539
[SPEAKER_29]: You fail your first song and put more coins in.

54:55.241 --> 54:57.142
[SPEAKER_02]: What an ingenious idea on how to make more money.

54:57.602 --> 55:00.763
[SPEAKER_20]: It really wasn't that much of an... It wasn't really an innovation at all.

55:01.023 --> 55:02.024
[SPEAKER_20]: And the songs were longer.

55:03.010 --> 55:07.651
[SPEAKER_20]: which in some cases was okay, but overall, the steps were awful.

55:07.811 --> 55:08.632
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, really awful.

55:08.672 --> 55:10.232
[SPEAKER_20]: It felt like playing a Korean mix.

55:11.332 --> 55:12.953
[SPEAKER_20]: Korean third?

55:13.853 --> 55:20.315
[SPEAKER_20]: There were some good steps in Korean third, but I'm talking about how many jumps there were in everything, which I really hate doing.

55:22.215 --> 55:26.597
[SPEAKER_20]: It was like playing Konami of Hawaii steps.

55:28.197 --> 55:29.097
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how it was.

55:29.878 --> 55:31.418
[SPEAKER_29]: That's a bad inside reference.

55:32.884 --> 55:37.169
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but you don't mean like Ultramix 2 steps, because those... I mean like Panomics.

55:38.571 --> 55:43.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, or like, um, uh, Service, or, I keep saying Service, Songpacks 1 through 6.

55:43.837 --> 55:44.097
[SPEAKER_19]: Yes.

55:44.478 --> 55:44.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

55:44.658 --> 55:45.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Like playing those.

55:45.559 --> 55:45.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

55:46.914 --> 55:48.155
[SPEAKER_02]: I keep saying Service Pack.

55:48.335 --> 55:50.657
[SPEAKER_02]: I always say Service Pack because I get it confused with Microsoft.

55:50.917 --> 55:52.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Songpacks 1 through 6 then.

55:52.678 --> 55:52.938
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

55:53.058 --> 55:53.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

55:53.699 --> 55:57.101
[SPEAKER_20]: That's how, that's, it was Konami of Hawaii Steps.

55:57.481 --> 56:02.785
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I've actually played in the groove probably two times, at least two times this week, if not three.

56:03.025 --> 56:03.285
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

56:03.325 --> 56:03.886
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost count.

56:04.526 --> 56:06.968
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm warming up to it a little more.

56:07.915 --> 56:09.656
[SPEAKER_02]: But, I don't know.

56:10.636 --> 56:17.239
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I still, I'm like, I feel like this is just something to hold me over until the real thing is back.

56:17.579 --> 56:25.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like I've gone from regular soda to diet soda, and I'm still trying to get used to that nasty aftertaste that you get from diet soda.

56:26.443 --> 56:27.463
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how it is.

56:27.563 --> 56:32.045
[SPEAKER_02]: And like, I'm like, you know, as soon as they come out with a new flavor of soda, I'm going to go right back to it.

56:32.785 --> 56:34.246
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about this whole thing.

56:36.546 --> 56:40.330
[SPEAKER_29]: Once they put the cocaine back in the Coca-Cola, you'll be ready to go.

56:42.252 --> 56:44.574
[SPEAKER_20]: Then you won't need the diet because the cocaine will take care of that for you.

56:44.714 --> 56:45.915
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so here's the interesting thing.

56:45.975 --> 56:47.957
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think it's going to be like on PlayStation 2?

56:49.779 --> 56:51.080
[SPEAKER_20]: I haven't put much thought into it.

56:51.741 --> 56:53.022
[SPEAKER_20]: It's not like I'm going to waste my money on it.

56:53.382 --> 56:54.203
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the interesting thing.

56:54.263 --> 56:56.905
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to start thinking about it because guess where we're going on Wednesday?

56:57.426 --> 56:58.547
[SPEAKER_20]: You and I. That's true.

56:58.627 --> 56:59.148
[SPEAKER_20]: There's that.

57:00.242 --> 57:07.468
[SPEAKER_02]: So somehow we have managed to get an invite to the In The Groove premiere party in San Francisco.

57:08.268 --> 57:11.251
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go check out the In The Groove on PlayStation 2.

57:11.911 --> 57:12.772
[SPEAKER_02]: And here's the great thing.

57:13.312 --> 57:15.334
[SPEAKER_02]: The invite said, now, I haven't told you this.

57:15.374 --> 57:18.156
[SPEAKER_02]: I was waiting for the show to tell you this, specifically on the show.

57:18.937 --> 57:19.597
[SPEAKER_02]: Free drinks.

57:20.638 --> 57:21.599
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, cool, liquor!

57:23.220 --> 57:28.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, what I'm curious about is what if for every drink you have to say something nice about In The Groove?

57:30.427 --> 57:30.707
[SPEAKER_02]: Lame.

57:32.007 --> 57:32.988
[SPEAKER_20]: I like this song.

57:33.008 --> 57:34.988
[SPEAKER_20]: This song's cool, too.

57:35.008 --> 57:37.208
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't suck that much.

57:37.268 --> 57:38.729
[SPEAKER_20]: I need to download this song.

57:40.969 --> 57:47.951
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is interesting because one of the... My biggest problem within the group is that I... Like, half the songs don't do it for me.

57:48.651 --> 57:52.712
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I'm not as big on the song list, but... I like the hip-hoppy ones, actually.

57:53.552 --> 57:56.553
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that... I guess that's where we differ because I don't care for those tracks.

57:56.573 --> 57:58.113
[SPEAKER_20]: The trance I can do without because trance is...

57:59.420 --> 58:07.248
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I actually like the really stupid, dancey covers of Mouth and Torn and all that stuff.

58:07.508 --> 58:11.732
[SPEAKER_20]: I want innovation in music, and all trance is is rehashing.

58:11.913 --> 58:12.693
[SPEAKER_20]: That's all it is.

58:13.054 --> 58:15.136
[SPEAKER_20]: Let's add some synthesizer to it and call it music.

58:16.724 --> 58:18.346
[SPEAKER_29]: Here's the issue with trance.

58:18.406 --> 58:21.970
[SPEAKER_29]: It's all just disco sped up with lots of synthesizers.

58:23.071 --> 58:27.876
[SPEAKER_29]: Disco, you know, well, there's a lot of dancing involved in disco, so I guess it works.

58:27.957 --> 58:31.821
[SPEAKER_29]: But there's just not a lot of talented trance artists out there.

58:31.841 --> 58:34.504
[SPEAKER_29]: You gotta go to the very select few artists like...

58:35.541 --> 58:38.082
[SPEAKER_29]: One I'm really big on right now, Yuzo Koshiro.

58:38.302 --> 58:40.963
[SPEAKER_29]: He does an awesome soundtrack for that One Gun Midnight Maximum.

58:42.124 --> 58:44.865
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, just very few good artists will do trance well.

58:44.925 --> 58:47.746
[SPEAKER_29]: So most of the time you're just going to find shitty trance tracks.

58:47.886 --> 58:51.127
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, like just about what you find on every single compilation out there.

58:51.267 --> 58:51.908
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, exactly.

58:53.028 --> 59:01.672
[SPEAKER_29]: And to me, my favorite trance, the songs that I think are actually good trance songs are done by artists who don't technically, they don't really do trance typically.

59:01.852 --> 59:02.312
[SPEAKER_29]: They do normal...

59:02.592 --> 59:05.037
[SPEAKER_29]: Like Delirium, there's a song I'm really loving.

59:05.217 --> 59:06.018
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe I'll tell you about it later.

59:06.038 --> 59:06.359
[SPEAKER_29]: Whatever.

59:08.453 --> 59:11.314
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, his microphone's on, but these mics are acting very weird.

59:11.334 --> 59:11.614
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

59:11.674 --> 59:16.735
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's because this one's a cardio, so it depends on... It's because Rob's too loud and Brad's too quiet.

59:17.635 --> 59:18.235
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what it is.

59:18.395 --> 59:19.636
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't make them both work.

59:19.656 --> 59:21.496
[SPEAKER_29]: There's no perfect medium, you know?

59:21.516 --> 59:22.036
[SPEAKER_02]: No, there isn't.

59:22.416 --> 59:30.238
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either you talk too close to the mic, you being Rob, because obviously pointing does not really, you know, show its way through radio.

59:30.978 --> 59:32.019
[SPEAKER_29]: There's the camera.

59:32.059 --> 59:32.619
[SPEAKER_29]: They can see it.

59:33.259 --> 59:34.379
[SPEAKER_29]: You're pointing at the camera.

59:34.419 --> 59:35.279
[SPEAKER_29]: You're pointing at the audience.

59:35.299 --> 59:35.499
[SPEAKER_02]: You!

59:35.659 --> 59:36.080
[SPEAKER_02]: Camera!

59:36.340 --> 59:37.560
[SPEAKER_02]: You are talking too loud.

59:37.620 --> 59:37.700
[SPEAKER_02]: No...

59:38.300 --> 59:48.308
[SPEAKER_02]: No, honestly, because I'm talking and I'm starting to, like, you know, static out and I'm not even hitting a peak yellow yet, which means that there's something too loud somewhere.

59:48.588 --> 59:51.770
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know what the hell you guys did to this board here.

59:51.790 --> 59:55.773
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know where to... You jinxed it with Judo Curse.

59:55.873 --> 59:56.394
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

59:57.915 --> 01:00:01.638
[SPEAKER_29]: But anyways... Check the levels going into the computer.

01:00:01.658 --> 01:00:02.378
[SPEAKER_29]: I checked.

01:00:02.538 --> 01:00:03.639
[SPEAKER_29]: Look at the hardware in the computer.

01:00:03.739 --> 01:00:04.060
[SPEAKER_29]: Jeez.

01:00:07.043 --> 01:00:07.423
[SPEAKER_29]: Anyways.

01:00:07.663 --> 01:00:08.704
[SPEAKER_29]: Turn down the mic boost.

01:00:09.824 --> 01:00:13.146
[SPEAKER_02]: What we might want to do is maybe do a mic shuffle back to the mics we used to have.

01:00:13.886 --> 01:00:14.226
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:00:14.386 --> 01:00:15.447
[SPEAKER_02]: Mic shuffle.

01:00:17.167 --> 01:00:20.089
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on the mic that I used to be on and I'm still fine.

01:00:20.509 --> 01:00:20.929
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:00:21.069 --> 01:00:22.009
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just... It's nothing.

01:00:22.029 --> 01:00:22.770
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to worry about it.

01:00:22.830 --> 01:00:25.411
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that I turned up and I'm trying to... Moving forward.

01:00:25.551 --> 01:00:26.431
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, moving on.

01:00:26.491 --> 01:00:27.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

01:00:27.132 --> 01:00:28.832
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, you know, the sound issues are important.

01:00:28.892 --> 01:00:30.053
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can't hear us, you know...

01:00:30.552 --> 01:00:32.053
[SPEAKER_20]: If they can't hear us, they can turn up the radio.

01:00:32.073 --> 01:00:39.916
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just joining us, we are doing our first show in the brand new studio, so we've got audio issues tonight, but hopefully we will be able to make everything work out.

01:00:40.017 --> 01:00:42.298
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bear with us, and we'll get through this.

01:00:42.478 --> 01:00:44.419
[SPEAKER_02]: It also could be that these headphones suck.

01:00:44.659 --> 01:00:46.039
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be, so I'm not going to worry about it.

01:00:46.680 --> 01:00:51.382
[SPEAKER_02]: The chat room has been yelling when levels are fine, I don't know, so maybe you want to pay attention to that.

01:00:51.402 --> 01:00:52.302
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's on delay.

01:00:52.642 --> 01:00:53.663
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I know, it doesn't help.

01:00:54.571 --> 01:00:56.553
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's try leaving the audio here.

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:58.094
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's switch back and just see what happens.

01:00:58.114 --> 01:00:59.315
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like our audio is okay now.

01:00:59.516 --> 01:00:59.856
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:01:00.296 --> 01:01:00.837
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to tell.

01:01:02.779 --> 01:01:03.439
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see what happens.

01:01:05.842 --> 01:01:06.382
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

01:01:07.303 --> 01:01:09.665
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that In The Groove thing going on Wednesday.

01:01:10.286 --> 01:01:14.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's try to think what else is going on in the Bomani world right now.

01:01:20.379 --> 01:01:27.481
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything, DarkSakura, that you would like to see in the In the Groove release on PlayStation 2 that you didn't see in the arcade game?

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:31.882
[SPEAKER_20]: Lack of suckage.

01:01:36.384 --> 01:01:42.726
[SPEAKER_20]: It didn't 100% suck, but honestly, it's not DDR, you know?

01:01:43.666 --> 01:01:45.587
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like a big rip-off of DDR.

01:01:45.667 --> 01:01:46.587
[SPEAKER_20]: I can't get into it.

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:51.222
[SPEAKER_20]: I cannot look at that game without thinking, wow, they totally bid on DDR.

01:01:52.883 --> 01:01:54.043
[SPEAKER_20]: Sorry, that's how I feel.

01:01:56.925 --> 01:01:57.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, my mic was off, sorry.

01:01:58.046 --> 01:01:59.166
[SPEAKER_02]: That's alright, you're welcome to your opinion.

01:02:02.388 --> 01:02:06.451
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to do now, let's move into talking about last week's show.

01:02:06.491 --> 01:02:12.634
[SPEAKER_02]: And last week's show, we actually had not one, but two cage matches that took place last week.

01:02:12.654 --> 01:02:16.697
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a tape show, and I hope you guys were able to tune in and check it out.

01:02:17.407 --> 01:02:20.669
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that, we did two cage matches.

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:25.152
[SPEAKER_02]: The first cage match was talking about the ultimate cage match.

01:02:25.552 --> 01:02:32.557
[SPEAKER_02]: In other words, we've had three songs that have been retired from Orange Lounge cage match, meaning they won four weeks in a row.

01:02:32.917 --> 01:02:39.822
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to face off each of those songs against each other and see what the ultimate cage match victor would be.

01:02:40.142 --> 01:02:42.784
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you guys curious to hear which song won that?

01:02:43.864 --> 01:02:44.125
[SPEAKER_25]: Sure.

01:02:44.545 --> 01:02:46.026
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, based off your votes...

01:02:46.824 --> 01:02:50.526
[SPEAKER_02]: on OrangeLoungeRadio.com because that's the way we voted in both cage matches this week.

01:02:50.947 --> 01:03:06.896
[SPEAKER_02]: The winning song of the ultimate cage match, meaning that this is just like the best song I guess you guys think we've played in the past hundred episodes we've been doing the cage match, is... Echo Image with Come Back.

01:03:06.916 --> 01:03:07.096
[SPEAKER_13]: Woo!

01:03:10.899 --> 01:03:14.762
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our ultimate cage match, because we did each song that got retired.

01:03:15.342 --> 01:03:16.303
[SPEAKER_02]: Pay attention, like you still.

01:03:17.984 --> 01:03:21.067
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so Echo Image will come back was the winner.

01:03:22.788 --> 01:03:32.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, we did another cage match, and that cage match was choosing which song should be banned from Orange Lounge Radio forever.

01:03:32.736 --> 01:03:33.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

01:03:33.556 --> 01:03:34.997
[SPEAKER_02]: And we let you guys vote on that.

01:03:36.318 --> 01:03:38.440
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's what we call a reverse cage match.

01:03:40.733 --> 01:03:42.955
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys picked a winner.

01:03:42.995 --> 01:03:45.116
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess really more appropriately, it would probably be a loser.

01:03:46.517 --> 01:03:50.739
[SPEAKER_02]: But the songs that were up were Britney Spears with My Prerogative.

01:03:51.780 --> 01:03:52.660
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was Jamie's pick.

01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:57.943
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I picked DJ Speedo featuring Wild Side with the Catch-Up song.

01:03:58.524 --> 01:04:03.827
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Loki picked Kids Bop Kids doing Bring Me to Life with Corky.

01:04:05.828 --> 01:04:06.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Wake me up.

01:04:07.068 --> 01:04:07.869
[SPEAKER_15]: Wake me up!

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:13.562
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, do you guys want to know what song is being banned from Orange Laundry Radio forever?

01:04:15.263 --> 01:04:15.664
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

01:04:22.128 --> 01:04:28.432
[SPEAKER_02]: So, Kids Bop Kids, Bring Me To Life, banned from the station forever.

01:04:28.552 --> 01:04:30.573
[SPEAKER_02]: Good riddance, you piece of shit song.

01:04:32.534 --> 01:04:32.754
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:04:33.655 --> 01:04:35.216
[SPEAKER_29]: Do you have a cage match pick today already?

01:04:36.297 --> 01:04:36.677
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I do.

01:04:39.087 --> 01:04:39.988
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it that Delirium thing?

01:04:40.488 --> 01:04:41.769
[SPEAKER_02]: I told you I put that song in already.

01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:43.230
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.

01:04:43.850 --> 01:04:44.330
[SPEAKER_02]: Long time ago.

01:04:48.573 --> 01:04:49.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, maybe I'm confused.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:50.254
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

01:04:50.374 --> 01:04:50.674
[SPEAKER_02]: Who cares?

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:52.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway.

01:04:52.695 --> 01:04:52.735
[SPEAKER_02]: Um...

01:04:55.762 --> 01:05:00.725
[SPEAKER_02]: What we're going to do now, we're going to go to a break, then we're going to come back and get into a couple other topics in tonight's cage match.

01:05:01.145 --> 01:05:11.230
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured to humor the discussion we've been having, I'll actually, and our chat room has kind of been asking for this for a little while, so I'm actually going to play some music from In the Groove for you guys.

01:05:12.491 --> 01:05:17.814
[SPEAKER_02]: So, enjoy, and we'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge Radio. ...

01:07:14.273 --> 01:07:15.895
Thank you for watching!

01:07:46.760 --> 01:07:48.386
Thanks for watching!

01:08:30.481 --> 01:08:44.555
[SPEAKER_11]: Charlie's body lets me die So please take care of yourself Don't give away everything you own Cause no one will give you back The innocence that you have lost Charlie, you're still getting a sister of mine

01:09:12.158 --> 01:09:13.099
Thanks for watching!

01:13:30.815 --> 01:13:39.278
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey guys, we're back with more Orange Lounge Radio.

01:13:39.318 --> 01:13:43.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the new promos was something else on the list of things to do that didn't get done, but we've just been busy.

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:51.342
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard about our dramatic week, so, you know, we'll just get past it and, you know, do something more constructive later on.

01:13:51.662 --> 01:13:58.105
[SPEAKER_02]: We are going to open up the Skype line very, very soon, so head on over to www.orangeloungeradio.com and click on Interact With Us.

01:13:58.145 --> 01:13:59.105
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have no clue...

01:13:59.551 --> 01:14:03.834
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm talking about, because that's the only way you guys are going to get to call in and interact with our station.

01:14:04.374 --> 01:14:06.955
[SPEAKER_02]: First, though, I want to point out the songs that we played in that break.

01:14:06.995 --> 01:14:15.420
[SPEAKER_02]: We played Banzai with Anubis, Missing Heart, Charlene, Smiley with Shusha, and Ka with Dawn.

01:14:15.580 --> 01:14:18.782
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, here's the interesting thing about Dawn.

01:14:19.703 --> 01:14:20.944
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope I still have this.

01:14:21.024 --> 01:14:22.124
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope I didn't get rid of it.

01:14:22.184 --> 01:14:23.265
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be pissed if I did.

01:14:24.005 --> 01:14:25.907
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably did and didn't even realize it.

01:14:27.327 --> 01:14:28.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Shoot, I think I did.

01:14:29.405 --> 01:14:31.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me run a search real quick.

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:39.050
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we actually used to spin the song Dawn on our station like a long time ago when we first started.

01:14:39.391 --> 01:14:45.294
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was one of those, this isn't in a Bomani game yet, but it will be someday, we think.

01:14:45.655 --> 01:14:48.656
[SPEAKER_02]: And heaven forbid, it actually did show up in a game.

01:14:49.057 --> 01:14:54.420
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it wasn't really a Bomani game, it was more of a, you know, one of Bomani game, but I don't know.

01:14:56.380 --> 01:14:57.482
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe Monty, get it?

01:14:57.562 --> 01:14:58.203
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe Monty?

01:14:58.384 --> 01:14:58.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Wannabe?

01:14:59.986 --> 01:15:01.189
[SPEAKER_02]: I read that on a forum somewhere.

01:15:01.209 --> 01:15:01.850
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was funny.

01:15:04.194 --> 01:15:05.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Darn, I wish we had it.

01:15:06.164 --> 01:15:08.605
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I actually, oh no no, I do have it, listen to this, listen to this.

01:15:08.945 --> 01:15:11.206
[SPEAKER_02]: This is dated July 23rd, 2002.

01:15:12.666 --> 01:15:14.707
[SPEAKER_02]: This file's dated July 23rd, 2002.

01:15:15.667 --> 01:15:17.447
[SPEAKER_02]: That's three years ago.

01:15:18.008 --> 01:15:23.089
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, an original work that could one day very well be in a Bomani game.

01:15:23.609 --> 01:15:26.330
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Kiel with the song Dawn.

01:15:26.650 --> 01:15:32.812
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like what you hear, visit www.amcast.com slash K-E-E-L.

01:15:34.774 --> 01:15:43.576
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that was like, I don't know how long ago, July 2002, and I don't even know if that website exists anymore, and he changed his name and all that stuff too, so very interesting.

01:15:43.916 --> 01:15:50.077
[SPEAKER_02]: So, let's see, we played that before it was in a music rhythm game.

01:15:50.177 --> 01:15:55.378
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've had, what, three songs from our cage match that ended up in a music rhythm game that we played here first, so, you know.

01:15:56.298 --> 01:15:57.578
[SPEAKER_02]: I just like thinking we're cool.

01:15:58.198 --> 01:15:59.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Inflate my ego here a little bit, please.

01:16:01.819 --> 01:16:02.099
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:16:03.041 --> 01:16:04.605
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's do this.

01:16:04.625 --> 01:16:10.257
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to open up the Skype line, so go ahead and give us a call, and we'll hear from what you have to say.

01:16:10.277 --> 01:16:13.123
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to talk to us about what we let him talk to us about tonight.

01:16:15.778 --> 01:16:19.001
[SPEAKER_02]: In The Groove, The Award Show, if you guys were listening last night.

01:16:19.101 --> 01:16:20.563
[SPEAKER_02]: Just whatever's on your mind.

01:16:20.623 --> 01:16:21.203
[SPEAKER_02]: I really don't care.

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:27.549
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to talk about Renee Sebastian and her chef, you know, Miss Chef is what I'd like to call her.

01:16:27.789 --> 01:16:28.390
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what was it?

01:16:28.670 --> 01:16:31.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Those artists that played in the Live 365 Awards.

01:16:31.293 --> 01:16:39.460
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, I had a lot of respect for those folks because they were very passionate and very talented, unlike a lot of folks I see on the television.

01:16:39.981 --> 01:16:40.201
[SPEAKER_02]: But...

01:16:41.115 --> 01:16:42.056
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so in love with you

01:16:57.851 --> 01:17:03.876
[SPEAKER_08]: I want you to lay me down, and start screwing me up and down, and then you're gonna come into me.

01:17:03.996 --> 01:17:07.119
[SPEAKER_08]: I swear to God, that was one of the lyrics, like, you're gonna come into me.

01:17:07.459 --> 01:17:09.501
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was like, oh my God, this chick is foul.

01:17:09.601 --> 01:17:11.363
[SPEAKER_08]: And the gospel people were there too.

01:17:11.383 --> 01:17:13.925
[SPEAKER_02]: What's great about the song is it went on too long.

01:17:14.005 --> 01:17:22.192
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like, and then I want you up and down, up and down, around, up, down, up and around, in, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:17:22.512 --> 01:17:27.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Suddenly she was singing DDR Steps and how to find her G-spot.

01:17:27.734 --> 01:17:29.135
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, we're going to take a call.

01:17:29.175 --> 01:17:30.155
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:17:30.175 --> 01:17:30.515
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's this?

01:17:31.595 --> 01:17:36.917
[SPEAKER_28]: Emerging from the shadows of Imani style, your resident 2DX bastard, DarkLionXVI is here.

01:17:37.538 --> 01:17:39.618
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, alright, alright.

01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:41.059
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone doesn't need their own intro.

01:17:41.099 --> 01:17:44.460
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going to do this WWE style.

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:49.202
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Kinsville with the Rock is Cookin' and just play the music.

01:17:49.242 --> 01:17:50.242
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, go ahead.

01:17:50.783 --> 01:17:51.203
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever.

01:17:53.937 --> 01:17:55.278
[SPEAKER_02]: You just got told, what Emma?

01:17:55.358 --> 01:17:56.178
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, what Emma?

01:17:57.819 --> 01:17:58.799
[SPEAKER_28]: What's on your mind, Siggy?

01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:03.461
[SPEAKER_28]: Congratulations on your new studio.

01:18:04.261 --> 01:18:04.741
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.

01:18:04.841 --> 01:18:10.103
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually kind of a little bit of a downgrade, but the apartment itself is very, very nice.

01:18:10.203 --> 01:18:12.204
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I'm very happy with it.

01:18:12.304 --> 01:18:15.045
[SPEAKER_02]: And we like being cozy, don't we, kids?

01:18:15.565 --> 01:18:17.526
[SPEAKER_02]: I can reach out and touch Jamie in the studio.

01:18:20.187 --> 01:18:20.587
[SPEAKER_08]: My knee.

01:18:21.227 --> 01:18:23.188
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the sound that she made when I touched her knee.

01:18:25.225 --> 01:18:26.105
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we like it.

01:18:26.145 --> 01:18:26.426
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cool.

01:18:26.446 --> 01:18:27.706
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a lot of good things here.

01:18:29.287 --> 01:18:29.687
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you.

01:18:30.447 --> 01:18:30.707
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.

01:18:31.007 --> 01:18:31.968
[SPEAKER_02]: What else is on your mind, buddy?

01:18:32.548 --> 01:18:40.872
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, you know, last Friday I was able to play 2DX Red, and I was able to pass three Level 8 plus songs.

01:18:44.353 --> 01:18:44.813
[SPEAKER_28]: Which ones?

01:18:45.894 --> 01:18:49.535
[SPEAKER_28]: The three songs are Take It Easy, Setsugekka, and Rainbow Rainbow.

01:18:50.796 --> 01:18:52.637
[SPEAKER_02]: So wait, you played them and passed them?

01:18:52.677 --> 01:18:53.657
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I passed them all.

01:18:54.420 --> 01:18:55.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you big stud.

01:18:58.081 --> 01:19:06.103
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you one of those folks on Bomani style that gets into those, you know, those pissing contests about, you know, I pass this, or yo, I pass this.

01:19:06.383 --> 01:19:10.604
[SPEAKER_30]: I pass this blindfolded with one hand, and I'm better than Lisu, and da-ba-da-ba-da.

01:19:11.905 --> 01:19:13.145
[SPEAKER_28]: No, I'm not one of those.

01:19:13.405 --> 01:19:14.045
[SPEAKER_28]: Okay, good, good.

01:19:14.125 --> 01:19:17.966
[SPEAKER_28]: I just want to say... If you were, we'd have to shoot you.

01:19:20.532 --> 01:19:26.735
[SPEAKER_28]: But yeah, I just want to have my say about Drum Mania V. You want to say something about Drum Mania Guitar Freaks V?

01:19:27.456 --> 01:19:27.676
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah.

01:19:27.856 --> 01:19:28.376
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

01:19:29.377 --> 01:19:33.999
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, yeah, there's some new stuff on Drum Mania V, as everybody's saying.

01:19:34.519 --> 01:19:40.202
[SPEAKER_28]: And yeah, they have the, like, sorting it out.

01:19:40.302 --> 01:19:44.264
[SPEAKER_28]: They have a folder 80D or something like that.

01:19:44.865 --> 01:19:45.665
[SPEAKER_28]: It's really interesting.

01:19:47.146 --> 01:19:50.507
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't seen the game myself yet, so I can't really comment, but okay.

01:19:52.528 --> 01:19:56.929
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to play it someday, but I refuse to go to Roosevelt Golf Land to look at it, because that place is a dump.

01:19:57.309 --> 01:19:59.970
[SPEAKER_02]: But, someday.

01:20:01.991 --> 01:20:02.731
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else on your mind?

01:20:03.411 --> 01:20:05.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's kind of it.

01:20:05.532 --> 01:20:06.512
[SPEAKER_02]: How's Nightstyle coming?

01:20:06.532 --> 01:20:08.713
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you cleared everything yet, or you still got some songs to go?

01:20:09.533 --> 01:20:11.794
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, I can do bad one-handed.

01:20:13.826 --> 01:20:14.826
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing?

01:20:15.407 --> 01:20:17.388
[SPEAKER_02]: But I haven't made any double A's yet.

01:20:17.888 --> 01:20:19.128
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what do you do with the other hand?

01:20:20.209 --> 01:20:20.449
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:20:21.329 --> 01:20:23.010
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because you play bag one-handed.

01:20:23.050 --> 01:20:24.090
[SPEAKER_02]: What does the other hand do?

01:20:25.011 --> 01:20:26.331
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, the scratch, of course.

01:20:26.751 --> 01:20:27.432
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, okay.

01:20:27.712 --> 01:20:28.292
[SPEAKER_02]: That's boring.

01:20:29.833 --> 01:20:30.593
[SPEAKER_02]: That's two hands.

01:20:30.613 --> 01:20:33.934
[SPEAKER_02]: LankyStyle's calling you out saying that that's two hands if you use one for scratching.

01:20:35.755 --> 01:20:37.356
[SPEAKER_28]: One hand is actually, you know, just bring the keys.

01:20:37.476 --> 01:20:38.096
[SPEAKER_28]: Well, two hands.

01:20:39.997 --> 01:20:42.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, a lot of people play... Well, like, I play with, like...

01:20:43.927 --> 01:20:50.070
[SPEAKER_02]: 6 fingers when I play usually because I just use my thumb to hit the first two keys and I use my hand for the rest of them.

01:20:50.350 --> 01:20:51.510
[SPEAKER_02]: So I play 6 finger.

01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:52.851
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that worth something?

01:20:53.771 --> 01:20:54.471
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 6 finger.

01:20:55.472 --> 01:20:57.753
[SPEAKER_02]: Is 6 finger 2DX playing worth anything on the forums?

01:20:57.773 --> 01:21:01.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if I go post, I go, hey guys, I'm a 6 finger 2DX player.

01:21:01.254 --> 01:21:02.375
[SPEAKER_02]: Who wants to touch me?

01:21:02.675 --> 01:21:04.996
[SPEAKER_20]: I play 1 finger when I watch people pass those in others.

01:21:05.416 --> 01:21:06.056
[SPEAKER_20]: No, 1 finger.

01:21:06.076 --> 01:21:08.977
[SPEAKER_20]: Guess which finger that is.

01:21:10.218 --> 01:21:11.538
[SPEAKER_02]: Now what do you do with the other 9 fingers?

01:21:15.953 --> 01:21:21.877
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, the others are busy being held down while the one is gloriously extended in all of my fuck you glory.

01:21:22.657 --> 01:21:29.042
[SPEAKER_20]: And then the other one is usually, uh, usually, uh, I don't know, getting money.

01:21:29.062 --> 01:21:29.462
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

01:21:30.905 --> 01:21:31.486
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting a dollar.

01:21:31.786 --> 01:21:32.206
[SPEAKER_20]: Getting a dollar.

01:21:32.566 --> 01:21:32.907
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:21:33.007 --> 01:21:34.708
[SPEAKER_20]: Put a dollar in the token machine to play something else.

01:21:34.969 --> 01:21:36.069
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just messing with you, Siggy.

01:21:36.090 --> 01:21:37.651
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that you... That's all right.

01:21:37.691 --> 01:21:38.151
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all right.

01:21:38.191 --> 01:21:39.172
[SPEAKER_20]: We're teasing, you know.

01:21:39.192 --> 01:21:40.673
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool that you're doing the one-handed thing.

01:21:41.474 --> 01:21:54.706
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's kind of a nice way to play it because, you know... It leaves your other hand free for things like Doritos and... Or when you play Keyboard Mania, you're going to want to be able to do as much of that kind of note thing with one hand as possible.

01:21:54.966 --> 01:21:55.947
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one thing I always know.

01:21:55.987 --> 01:21:57.488
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you played much Keyboard Mania at all?

01:21:58.362 --> 01:22:01.324
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have played Keyboard Mania twice back at MGL.

01:22:01.524 --> 01:22:01.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

01:22:01.964 --> 01:22:04.285
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really have to do the one hand.

01:22:04.685 --> 01:22:12.870
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to play on the expert levels, you have to be able to do things with one hand up here while you're doing a completely different note pattern down here, just like a normal piano playing, really.

01:22:13.310 --> 01:22:14.771
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one thing I noticed.

01:22:14.811 --> 01:22:15.071
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:22:16.007 --> 01:22:21.268
[SPEAKER_28]: Yeah, the only problem I have with Keyboard Mania is you don't know which fingers to press.

01:22:21.728 --> 01:22:29.310
[SPEAKER_28]: They should have that, like which fingers to press, like three as in the middle finger or one for the thumb.

01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:33.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a guide as to, you know, what... Yeah, it's a guide.

01:22:33.971 --> 01:22:38.372
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you kind of have to know piano and they teach you that stuff in piano.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:41.226
[SPEAKER_02]: But that would be cool if Keyboard Mania would show that stuff.

01:22:41.426 --> 01:22:43.708
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, hey, what a great sales piece.

01:22:43.748 --> 01:22:47.711
[SPEAKER_02]: They could sell Keyboard Mania as a piano teaching device, which I guess they did.

01:22:48.432 --> 01:22:51.354
[SPEAKER_02]: It did get a limited release, but come on.

01:22:51.795 --> 01:22:53.997
[SPEAKER_02]: Who do you know that owns Keyboard Mania for a PC?

01:22:54.597 --> 01:22:55.418
[SPEAKER_02]: Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.

01:22:55.438 --> 01:22:56.159
[SPEAKER_02]: No one, that's right.

01:22:58.521 --> 01:23:00.462
[SPEAKER_02]: They could mass market that if they wanted to.

01:23:00.662 --> 01:23:05.987
[SPEAKER_02]: They should just bring, I don't know, whatever.

01:23:07.774 --> 01:23:11.257
[SPEAKER_02]: They should have keyboard mania, like literally typing mania.

01:23:12.698 --> 01:23:13.659
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that in Japan.

01:23:14.480 --> 01:23:15.541
[SPEAKER_02]: The beat mania, da-da-da.

01:23:17.883 --> 01:23:19.565
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what I said when I played it, da-da-da.

01:23:19.745 --> 01:23:19.985
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway.

01:23:20.906 --> 01:23:23.089
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're going to let you go, Stiggy, but thanks so much for calling in.

01:23:23.129 --> 01:23:23.769
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one, okay?

01:23:24.270 --> 01:23:24.470
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.

01:23:24.690 --> 01:23:25.251
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, later.

01:23:25.851 --> 01:23:26.071
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

01:23:26.272 --> 01:23:26.952
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have an outro?

01:23:27.933 --> 01:23:28.133
[SPEAKER_10]: No.

01:23:28.534 --> 01:23:29.214
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, bye.

01:23:30.342 --> 01:23:30.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

01:23:31.203 --> 01:23:35.326
[SPEAKER_02]: I figured since he had this big introduction that he might have something to say as he's leaving, but I guess not.

01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:37.048
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what our next caller has to say.

01:23:37.088 --> 01:23:38.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, you're on Orange Launch Radio.

01:23:38.849 --> 01:23:40.050
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, SSJ100, Matt here.

01:23:40.170 --> 01:23:41.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, SSJ100, Matt here.

01:23:41.751 --> 01:23:42.272
[SPEAKER_02]: What's on your mind?

01:23:43.653 --> 01:23:43.973
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing.

01:23:43.993 --> 01:23:48.617
[SPEAKER_03]: I was ready to give my In the Groove review.

01:23:49.098 --> 01:23:49.538
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, goody.

01:23:49.698 --> 01:23:50.178
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:52.620
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, I actually got to try it.

01:23:52.660 --> 01:23:54.262
[SPEAKER_03]: It took me months to get it here, but...

01:23:56.527 --> 01:24:00.851
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyways, at first, when I first played it about three times, I hated it.

01:24:02.472 --> 01:24:07.876
[SPEAKER_03]: I hated the fact of bombs and other stuff, but I figured out you could take those off.

01:24:08.677 --> 01:24:11.419
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, actually, when you play it a bunch of times, it's not that bad.

01:24:12.440 --> 01:24:14.181
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you started to warm up to it a little bit?

01:24:14.241 --> 01:24:17.424
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, at first, you're like, this sucks, I hate it, but I can't stop playing it, right?

01:24:18.585 --> 01:24:18.785
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:24:19.534 --> 01:24:21.355
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of how I felt for a little bit.

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:23.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was okay with it when I first played.

01:24:23.437 --> 01:24:24.258
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just neutral.

01:24:24.578 --> 01:24:34.025
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, this isn't as great as all the people on the internet say it is, but it's not as bad as a lot of people on the internet say it is either, so I'm just going to stop paying attention to what I read on the internet.

01:24:34.806 --> 01:24:37.328
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.

01:24:37.388 --> 01:24:40.630
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I just switch off between that and DDR.

01:24:40.850 --> 01:24:43.472
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have both In The Groove and DDR at your local arcade?

01:24:44.413 --> 01:24:44.613
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

01:24:44.794 --> 01:24:46.675
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you notice if one is more popular than the other?

01:24:48.243 --> 01:24:49.945
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, In the Groove is way more popular.

01:24:50.205 --> 01:24:52.527
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I can get on the DDR all the time now.

01:24:53.208 --> 01:25:15.187
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what's interesting is that that's kind of the first I've really heard of that, because a lot of arcades I've been to, even when I went and saw In the Groove in New Jersey, like last year when it was being beta tested or whatever, there were more people on DDR Extreme than In the Groove, and I thought that was kind of interesting, because I was like, dude, this is like one of two places in the nation where you can actually play this game, and there's still more people playing DDR.

01:25:16.580 --> 01:25:21.420
[SPEAKER_02]: And even when I go to the local bowling alley that has more games, I see more kids on DDR

01:25:22.862 --> 01:25:31.646
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the reason for that is that in the groove, despite the fact that it's a technically good game and it's got good music and stuff, it's just ugly.

01:25:32.186 --> 01:25:33.667
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a really ugly game.

01:25:34.707 --> 01:25:38.129
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry to the folks that designed the graphics, but it's kind of ugly.

01:25:38.189 --> 01:25:42.411
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR has that warm, saccharine, happy, crack vibe, right?

01:25:42.731 --> 01:25:47.373
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas in the groove it has that, I'm industrial and I don't want anything to do with you vibe.

01:25:47.413 --> 01:25:48.353
[SPEAKER_20]: I think maybe that's it.

01:25:48.393 --> 01:25:49.534
[SPEAKER_20]: It's too Americanized.

01:25:50.914 --> 01:25:51.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe.

01:25:51.955 --> 01:25:52.235
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:25:53.666 --> 01:25:54.026
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:25:54.366 --> 01:25:55.967
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's why I think more people are his own.

01:25:56.327 --> 01:25:56.987
[SPEAKER_02]: So what would you say?

01:25:57.027 --> 01:25:59.848
[SPEAKER_02]: If he gave In the Groove a score on a scale of 1 to 5, what would you say?

01:26:00.408 --> 01:26:04.789
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I first played it, I gave it about a 6, and now it's kind of like an 8 or so.

01:26:05.050 --> 01:26:05.770
[SPEAKER_03]: On a scale of 1 to 5?

01:26:06.230 --> 01:26:06.810
[SPEAKER_03]: That's incredible.

01:26:06.830 --> 01:26:07.410
[SPEAKER_03]: 1 to 5?

01:26:07.550 --> 01:26:09.191
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you said 1 to 10.

01:26:09.271 --> 01:26:09.431
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, 1 to 10.

01:26:09.731 --> 01:26:10.551
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's fine.

01:26:11.832 --> 01:26:14.432
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't matter, but... All right.

01:26:14.592 --> 01:26:15.113
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what else?

01:26:15.433 --> 01:26:16.473
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else you wanted to share with us?

01:26:18.230 --> 01:26:21.776
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, not really, just congratulations on the new, uh, place.

01:26:22.196 --> 01:26:23.178
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, we appreciate it.

01:26:23.198 --> 01:26:26.683
[SPEAKER_02]: We hope we can get all our sound working and everything, although I think, I think everything's cool now.

01:26:27.965 --> 01:26:28.726
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yep.

01:26:29.367 --> 01:26:29.667
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright.

01:26:30.128 --> 01:26:31.970
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks, have a good one, thanks for calling in.

01:26:32.852 --> 01:26:33.132
[SPEAKER_02]: Later.

01:26:35.302 --> 01:26:36.583
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always nice to hear from folks.

01:26:36.643 --> 01:26:41.545
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, what we're going to do, we're going to go into the Orange Lounge cage match right now.

01:26:41.605 --> 01:26:44.206
[SPEAKER_02]: If you didn't get through, try back again later.

01:26:44.226 --> 01:26:45.807
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of you guys just keep hammering us.

01:26:45.847 --> 01:26:47.827
[SPEAKER_02]: You just call again and again and again until you get through.

01:26:49.068 --> 01:26:51.749
[SPEAKER_02]: You can stop doing that because we're not taking any more calls until the cage match is over.

01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:56.031
[SPEAKER_02]: But thanks for trying, and we'll get to you guys later.

01:26:56.051 --> 01:26:59.372
[SPEAKER_02]: I know a lot of you guys have some things to say, and we'll get into some more of the money news a little later.

01:26:59.392 --> 01:27:02.794
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've got some business to settle, such as tonight's cage match.

01:27:06.462 --> 01:27:07.823
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a Cage Match song tonight, Loki?

01:27:08.063 --> 01:27:08.363
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, goody.

01:27:08.823 --> 01:27:09.003
[SPEAKER_02]: Good.

01:27:09.023 --> 01:27:11.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's see.

01:27:11.164 --> 01:27:12.125
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting fresh.

01:27:12.845 --> 01:27:16.647
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as a reminder, the way the Cage Match works, we play three songs for you guys.

01:27:17.027 --> 01:27:25.491
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys vote on your favorite song, and the winning song goes into rotation all week long on Orange Lounge Radio's Bomani Music & More program.

01:27:25.871 --> 01:27:27.332
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so we're starting fresh.

01:27:27.692 --> 01:27:28.913
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no old songs.

01:27:28.953 --> 01:27:31.694
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing three brand new songs this week.

01:27:32.054 --> 01:27:33.475
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess we'll start with my song.

01:27:34.946 --> 01:27:35.947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do my song first tonight.

01:27:35.967 --> 01:27:38.569
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to hear them all in their entirety.

01:27:38.609 --> 01:27:46.194
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, the only way you can vote is to actually be in our chat room over at www.orangeloungeradio.com.

01:27:47.155 --> 01:27:56.942
[SPEAKER_02]: The song I decided to put in tonight's cage match, when I first heard this song, I was like, this song kind of reminds me of Erotic, but without so much cheese.

01:27:57.763 --> 01:27:58.924
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I don't know, it's not so...

01:28:01.061 --> 01:28:02.242
[SPEAKER_02]: In the name of, in the name of love

01:29:24.295 --> 01:29:28.160
In the name of love In the name of, in the name of love

01:30:06.533 --> 01:30:07.774
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching!

01:30:35.861 --> 01:30:36.617
Thanks for watching!

01:31:59.234 --> 01:32:01.395
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, that was song number one in tonight's cage match.

01:32:01.415 --> 01:32:04.056
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Jet Set in the name of love.

01:32:04.236 --> 01:32:05.757
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and see what we think.

01:32:05.797 --> 01:32:07.378
[SPEAKER_02]: But remember, it's not our vote that counts.

01:32:07.418 --> 01:32:07.898
[SPEAKER_02]: It's yours.

01:32:07.998 --> 01:32:09.219
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to be in the chat room to play.

01:32:09.379 --> 01:32:10.599
[SPEAKER_02]: www.orangehunter.com.

01:32:11.019 --> 01:32:11.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Click on chat.

01:32:11.640 --> 01:32:11.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie.

01:32:12.600 --> 01:32:13.100
[SPEAKER_20]: It gets a one.

01:32:13.701 --> 01:32:15.581
[SPEAKER_20]: It has no originality to it.

01:32:15.721 --> 01:32:16.522
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing innovative.

01:32:17.282 --> 01:32:19.123
[SPEAKER_20]: It sounds like the same rehash.

01:32:20.023 --> 01:32:20.423
[SPEAKER_20]: No offense.

01:32:20.463 --> 01:32:21.344
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it was perky.

01:32:22.144 --> 01:32:25.186
[SPEAKER_20]: And if I wanted to make myself really happy, I guess I'd listen to it again.

01:32:25.726 --> 01:32:28.327
[SPEAKER_20]: But there was no innovation to it.

01:32:29.039 --> 01:32:29.640
[SPEAKER_20]: Nothing new.

01:32:30.800 --> 01:32:31.881
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, I'll be nice to three.

01:32:32.842 --> 01:32:33.682
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Loki.

01:32:34.243 --> 01:32:38.526
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'll be nice because I don't like Aqua or anything that tries to beat Aqua.

01:32:39.226 --> 01:32:55.238
[SPEAKER_02]: I honestly don't like the whole happy, you know, you got one guy that sings really deep and then the girl's like... But it reminded me of sort of like the woman's voice is out of place and the guy sounds like a member of, you know...

01:32:56.249 --> 01:33:05.035
[SPEAKER_02]: The Bloodhound Gang, so I just, I didn't really know, it didn't really feel right to me, but because it's trying to be happy, and I'm not happy, it gets a 2.

01:33:06.355 --> 01:33:22.025
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, my thoughts, I think that that song is, you know, it's like you take the Ironic and Aqua songs, which are like so happy to the point of nauseousness, and I think that song kind of strips a lot of that fakeness off, so I think you guys are

01:33:22.398 --> 01:33:25.779
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of closing yourself off to it, because it is a little bit formulaic, but whatever.

01:33:26.779 --> 01:33:31.060
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's decent, so I give it a 9, because it puts me in a good mood, makes me happy.

01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:31.801
[SPEAKER_30]: Angel?

01:33:36.502 --> 01:33:37.082
[SPEAKER_19]: Uh, 4.

01:33:38.182 --> 01:33:38.782
[SPEAKER_30]: Any reason why?

01:33:40.023 --> 01:33:43.164
[SPEAKER_19]: It's kind of, like, awkward, but it's missing something.

01:33:43.764 --> 01:33:44.284
[SPEAKER_19]: Alright.

01:33:44.824 --> 01:33:45.364
[SPEAKER_30]: Arcadian42?

01:33:45.464 --> 01:33:46.885
[SPEAKER_30]: It's heavy.

01:33:47.045 --> 01:33:47.645
[SPEAKER_26]: It was bouncy.

01:33:47.805 --> 01:33:48.405
[SPEAKER_26]: It was generic.

01:33:48.425 --> 01:33:48.405
5.

01:33:48.825 --> 01:33:50.026
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright.

01:33:50.866 --> 01:33:51.686
[SPEAKER_02]: And, LankyStyle?

01:33:53.638 --> 01:33:53.919
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

01:33:54.599 --> 01:33:55.499
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think of that song?

01:33:55.519 --> 01:33:56.180
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we doing here?

01:33:56.940 --> 01:33:57.360
[SPEAKER_02]: Forget it.

01:33:57.801 --> 01:33:58.161
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

01:33:59.282 --> 01:33:59.942
[SPEAKER_20]: Just rank the song.

01:33:59.962 --> 01:34:00.342
[SPEAKER_20]: What do you think?

01:34:00.422 --> 01:34:00.842
[SPEAKER_20]: One to ten.

01:34:03.784 --> 01:34:04.084
[SPEAKER_30]: Six.

01:34:06.085 --> 01:34:06.486
[SPEAKER_30]: Alright.

01:34:07.666 --> 01:34:08.647
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's move on.

01:34:08.727 --> 01:34:10.268
[SPEAKER_30]: Song number two is Jamie's Pick.

01:34:10.308 --> 01:34:11.769
[SPEAKER_30]: What did you pick for us tonight, Jamie?

01:34:12.649 --> 01:34:15.331
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been wanting to put this in like a month ago, but I kept winning.

01:34:16.331 --> 01:34:17.832
[SPEAKER_20]: It's Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.

01:34:18.092 --> 01:34:19.613
[SPEAKER_20]: I know it's been playing on the radio, but...

01:34:20.515 --> 01:34:23.397
[SPEAKER_20]: I really, really like this song a whole bunch.

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:26.518
[SPEAKER_20]: I really like everything they've been doing with music.

01:34:26.558 --> 01:34:27.399
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been innovative.

01:34:27.439 --> 01:34:27.959
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been new.

01:34:27.979 --> 01:34:31.461
[SPEAKER_20]: It's been taking the whole pop genre in a different direction.

01:34:32.481 --> 01:34:34.603
[SPEAKER_20]: And this one just has a really sexy bass line, too.

01:34:34.723 --> 01:34:36.043
[SPEAKER_20]: So I want that this ends.

01:34:37.464 --> 01:34:37.764
[SPEAKER_30]: All right.

01:34:38.164 --> 01:34:38.485
[SPEAKER_30]: Here it is.

01:34:38.525 --> 01:34:40.666
[SPEAKER_30]: Song number two, Gorillaz, Feel Good Inc.

01:34:40.906 --> 01:34:41.126
[SPEAKER_30]: Enjoy.

01:35:48.950 --> 01:35:50.933
[SPEAKER_16]: Thanks for watching!

01:36:42.253 --> 01:36:42.933
S, Actdeft,

01:37:11.420 --> 01:37:12.882
Thank you for watching!

01:38:26.109 --> 01:38:29.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number two there, Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.

01:38:29.671 --> 01:38:30.651
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd you guys feel?

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.953
[SPEAKER_02]: Did that make you feel good or make you feel sick?

01:38:33.053 --> 01:38:34.133
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, DarkSakura.

01:38:34.534 --> 01:38:37.155
[SPEAKER_20]: I've been listening to this song for two months and haven't gotten sick of it yet.

01:38:37.735 --> 01:38:39.816
[SPEAKER_20]: So, uh, it gets a ten automatically.

01:38:39.856 --> 01:38:41.737
[SPEAKER_20]: The whole album gets a fifty million.

01:38:41.838 --> 01:38:42.478
[SPEAKER_20]: So, yeah.

01:38:43.018 --> 01:38:44.139
[SPEAKER_20]: Buy Demon Days when it comes out.

01:38:45.239 --> 01:38:45.540
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki.

01:38:51.283 --> 01:38:51.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no mic.

01:38:53.164 --> 01:38:55.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, no, it has a good bass line.

01:38:55.465 --> 01:38:55.505
[SPEAKER_02]: Um,

01:38:56.425 --> 01:38:58.826
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's just, it's okay.

01:38:59.487 --> 01:39:00.407
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I like Gorillaz.

01:39:01.087 --> 01:39:02.128
[SPEAKER_02]: I love their older stuff.

01:39:02.968 --> 01:39:07.350
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, there's parts of the song I didn't like, and other parts are okay.

01:39:07.530 --> 01:39:12.633
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just gets like a 7 or 8-ish, you know, 8 I guess.

01:39:14.714 --> 01:39:18.037
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that song is kind of like a big cake to me.

01:39:18.457 --> 01:39:20.698
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you've got frost, like it's a multi-layered cake.

01:39:20.719 --> 01:39:26.042
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got this really like nice frosting, and then there's like really sweet stuff in the middle, like the fruit stuff in the middle.

01:39:26.062 --> 01:39:27.083
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of frosting are we talking about?

01:39:27.323 --> 01:39:29.124
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, strawberry frosting.

01:39:29.345 --> 01:39:29.485
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh!

01:39:30.205 --> 01:39:30.866
[SPEAKER_30]: Oh, oh.

01:39:31.266 --> 01:39:32.727
[SPEAKER_30]: You had me going with frosting.

01:39:32.747 --> 01:39:33.147
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, okay.

01:39:33.187 --> 01:39:33.808
[SPEAKER_30]: Cream cheese.

01:39:34.008 --> 01:39:35.149
[SPEAKER_02]: How about chocolate frosting?

01:39:35.709 --> 01:39:36.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Chocolate frosting?

01:39:36.390 --> 01:39:37.370
[SPEAKER_02]: How did I get that point?

01:39:37.510 --> 01:39:40.072
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like in the middle is like, I don't know, like extra chocolate.

01:39:40.092 --> 01:39:40.332
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

01:39:40.352 --> 01:39:41.052
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really sweet.

01:39:41.092 --> 01:39:44.714
[SPEAKER_02]: My point is, it's really sweet, like, but the rest of it's kind of cake.

01:39:44.754 --> 01:39:45.275
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just cake.

01:39:45.735 --> 01:39:51.438
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like, because that song is kind of like three things combined, it feels like to me, like there's different elements of it.

01:39:51.518 --> 01:39:56.541
[SPEAKER_02]: Or it's like you got a good cake and then they throw in that stupid custard filling and it's like, oh, goddamn!

01:39:56.881 --> 01:39:57.421
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more like it.

01:39:57.441 --> 01:39:58.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Why did you ruin a good cake?

01:39:58.622 --> 01:40:06.624
[SPEAKER_02]: That's kind of like it, because like there's two elements to that song I really, like especially one, like the slow parts of the song, I really, really, really like.

01:40:06.644 --> 01:40:07.845
[SPEAKER_20]: The slow parts are very blur.

01:40:08.465 --> 01:40:10.005
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see I like blur, I think that's why.

01:40:10.246 --> 01:40:12.726
[SPEAKER_02]: But then like the De La Soul stuff, that's like the custard.

01:40:12.926 --> 01:40:13.947
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not, I'm not dead on it.

01:40:13.967 --> 01:40:15.427
[SPEAKER_02]: See, that's what, I like the opposite.

01:40:15.547 --> 01:40:19.149
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the De La Soul stuff, but I hated the slow parts.

01:40:19.409 --> 01:40:21.009
[SPEAKER_30]: Well, then I feel the opposite.

01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:22.670
[SPEAKER_30]: But the score is still the same, I give it an 8.

01:40:23.070 --> 01:40:23.270
[SPEAKER_30]: Angel.

01:40:24.861 --> 01:40:28.984
[SPEAKER_19]: Yeah, I look good as well, so I will give it an 8.

01:40:29.824 --> 01:40:30.284
[SPEAKER_14]: Alright.

01:40:30.324 --> 01:40:34.607
[SPEAKER_19]: Not just because I'm copying you, but not really because I'm copying you, but... Just because you're copying us.

01:40:34.647 --> 01:40:35.047
[SPEAKER_19]: Arcadian.

01:40:35.147 --> 01:40:35.507
[SPEAKER_19]: Okay.

01:40:37.529 --> 01:40:39.250
[SPEAKER_25]: I like Boston Cream Pie.

01:40:39.630 --> 01:40:39.810
[SPEAKER_25]: Good.

01:40:40.791 --> 01:40:41.231
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah!

01:40:41.451 --> 01:40:43.412
[SPEAKER_20]: Boston Cream Pie is cake with custard.

01:40:43.893 --> 01:40:44.653
[SPEAKER_25]: Yeah, so it's good.

01:40:45.193 --> 01:40:46.334
[SPEAKER_25]: And Y'all Can Realize Rock 2.

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:46.334
9.

01:40:48.095 --> 01:40:49.996
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, uh, LankyStyle.

01:40:50.837 --> 01:40:50.917
[SPEAKER_29]: Um...

01:40:52.345 --> 01:40:56.929
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't think it makes me feel good, it makes me feel pretty ink, you know, incorporated.

01:40:58.190 --> 01:41:04.155
[SPEAKER_29]: No, you know what, I hate gorillas, like, they're always the source of any problem in like a sci-fi story.

01:41:05.015 --> 01:41:06.416
[SPEAKER_29]: Gorillas are monkeys too, right?

01:41:06.636 --> 01:41:11.440
[SPEAKER_20]: No, those are, you're thinking of monkeys are not gorillas.

01:41:12.701 --> 01:41:13.962
[SPEAKER_29]: They're apes, they're simians, right?

01:41:13.982 --> 01:41:15.143
[SPEAKER_20]: The monkeys had Mickey Dolenz!

01:41:17.005 --> 01:41:18.306
[SPEAKER_20]: And Davy Jones.

01:41:18.366 --> 01:41:19.206
[SPEAKER_29]: Exactly, Bradley.

01:41:19.487 --> 01:41:21.028
[SPEAKER_30]: However, Congo was a bad movie.

01:41:22.586 --> 01:41:25.407
[SPEAKER_30]: Gorillas learn sign language and talk to us.

01:41:25.427 --> 01:41:27.707
[SPEAKER_29]: Gorillas are smart, except for QD.

01:41:27.847 --> 01:41:29.868
[SPEAKER_29]: And apparently they can sing through a megaphone.

01:41:31.988 --> 01:41:38.090
[SPEAKER_02]: And they also, you know, take women and run up the Empire Stability.

01:41:38.210 --> 01:41:39.871
[SPEAKER_02]: They run them up the Empire Stability.

01:41:39.891 --> 01:41:43.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, that is... Will you please give the song a rating so we can finish this goddamn segment?

01:41:43.812 --> 01:41:45.272
[SPEAKER_29]: Okay, hold on, a little back...

01:41:46.142 --> 01:41:50.384
[SPEAKER_29]: I think this is the only good song on the new album.

01:41:50.485 --> 01:41:52.866
[SPEAKER_29]: I've listened to the whole thing and I'm not impressed.

01:41:52.906 --> 01:41:56.068
[SPEAKER_29]: The last album was much better in my opinion.

01:41:56.688 --> 01:41:57.769
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's still a good song.

01:41:57.789 --> 01:41:59.469
[SPEAKER_29]: Like I said, it's the best song on the album.

01:41:59.710 --> 01:42:01.170
[SPEAKER_29]: So it gets, for me, an 8.

01:42:02.351 --> 01:42:03.792
[SPEAKER_29]: But it's going to get old for me really quick.

01:42:03.812 --> 01:42:06.353
[SPEAKER_29]: I've already listened to it like four times and I'm still kind of like, hmm.

01:42:06.893 --> 01:42:09.515
[SPEAKER_29]: I did like the slow parts better than the rest of it.

01:42:09.615 --> 01:42:10.155
[SPEAKER_29]: I prefer blur.

01:42:12.695 --> 01:42:15.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's get into the last song of tonight's cage match.

01:42:15.438 --> 01:42:16.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Loki, what'd you pick?

01:42:17.840 --> 01:42:20.082
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I hope this is what's on this track here.

01:42:25.207 --> 01:42:31.894
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, hopefully this is, oh my god, I'm saying hopefully, a Paul Terry track.

01:42:31.994 --> 01:42:37.559
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully this is the song from the Midnight Tune 2 soundtrack.

01:42:39.764 --> 01:42:41.225
[SPEAKER_29]: Wangan Midnight Maximum 2 and 2.

01:42:41.685 --> 01:42:42.326
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that song.

01:42:42.626 --> 01:42:43.747
[SPEAKER_02]: Or that CD.

01:42:43.887 --> 01:42:45.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, it's an awesome game.

01:42:45.388 --> 01:42:49.631
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of an Initial D-ish type thing.

01:42:49.731 --> 01:42:51.112
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got pretty cool music in it.

01:42:51.452 --> 01:42:52.733
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's Paul Terry.

01:42:53.233 --> 01:42:56.636
[SPEAKER_02]: And Paul Terry, honestly, I hate Paul Terry.

01:42:56.776 --> 01:42:57.176
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate her.

01:42:57.216 --> 01:43:00.959
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it's the Paul Terry-Nyoki combo that I hate.

01:43:01.199 --> 01:43:03.040
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Paul Terry-Nyoki that is bad.

01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:06.182
[SPEAKER_02]: Paul Terry, other artists, that's okay.

01:43:06.383 --> 01:43:08.244
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a song that she sings in.

01:43:09.784 --> 01:43:11.585
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I don't remember the original artist.

01:43:12.806 --> 01:43:14.908
[SPEAKER_30]: It's Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary.

01:43:14.928 --> 01:43:21.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, anyway, the guy that did music for Actraiser, and so this is the song, Nothing Can Live Forever.

01:43:22.072 --> 01:43:26.134
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuzo Koshiro, featuring Politary, Nothing Can Live Forever, song number three.

01:43:26.154 --> 01:43:27.755
[SPEAKER_02]: I am crossing my fingers, I hope this is the right studio.

01:43:27.775 --> 01:43:28.456
[SPEAKER_02]: Enjoy, me too.

01:43:34.259 --> 01:43:35.700
The time has come to say

01:43:49.462 --> 01:43:50.923
Thank you for watching

01:44:20.496 --> 01:44:21.897
I'm approaching my truth.

01:46:35.270 --> 01:46:37.174
Thanks for watching!

01:47:07.333 --> 01:47:14.237
Thanks for watching!

01:48:02.130 --> 01:48:03.084
Thanks for watching!

01:49:13.484 --> 01:49:15.786
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was song number three in tonight's cage match.

01:49:15.846 --> 01:49:21.970
[SPEAKER_02]: That was Yuzo Koshiro featuring Paula Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.

01:49:22.010 --> 01:49:25.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Will that song live forever in your memory or is it going to die right now?

01:49:25.732 --> 01:49:26.072
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamie?

01:49:29.054 --> 01:49:31.696
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't like Paula Terry because she can't hold a key to save her life.

01:49:33.337 --> 01:49:34.318
[SPEAKER_20]: It was still pretty good.

01:49:34.358 --> 01:49:36.179
[SPEAKER_20]: I mean, it's too trance for my taste.

01:49:37.220 --> 01:49:39.982
[SPEAKER_20]: But overall, it presented...

01:49:41.164 --> 01:49:44.045
[SPEAKER_20]: It presented an image, that's all I can say.

01:49:44.085 --> 01:49:52.049
[SPEAKER_20]: I like music that presents a picture, and that one I definitely got a feeling from, so it gets an 8 from me.

01:49:53.650 --> 01:50:04.515
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the song, I like the beginning part with her sort of singing over it, because it's kind of like, you know, it kind of builds you up for it, but then the song kind of is like...

01:50:04.949 --> 01:50:06.109
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, it's an okay song.

01:50:06.269 --> 01:50:11.171
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what I had because I haven't cut down certain other songs that I need to be submitting to the cage match.

01:50:11.711 --> 01:50:13.612
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, so it gets an 8.

01:50:13.652 --> 01:50:18.553
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the best I'm gonna give it because... But, you gotta check out the whole soundtrack, it's really cool.

01:50:20.514 --> 01:50:23.775
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I like the first minute, and then the other four I fell asleep.

01:50:24.335 --> 01:50:24.595
[SPEAKER_02]: I give it a 6.

01:50:25.575 --> 01:50:25.855
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

01:50:28.116 --> 01:50:31.437
[SPEAKER_19]: It was pretty cool, um, I'll be nice and give it a 7.

01:50:32.077 --> 01:50:33.918
[SPEAKER_19]: Because I don't know what else to give it, whatever.

01:50:35.350 --> 01:50:35.930
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian.

01:50:37.491 --> 01:50:38.091
[SPEAKER_27]: It was alright.

01:50:39.231 --> 01:50:40.352
[SPEAKER_27]: I wasn't all that impressed.

01:50:40.392 --> 01:50:42.232
[SPEAKER_27]: I haven't listened to the soundtrack yet.

01:50:42.672 --> 01:50:43.593
[SPEAKER_27]: But I'll give it a 6.

01:50:44.433 --> 01:50:45.093
[SPEAKER_02]: Lanky Style.

01:50:46.053 --> 01:50:51.335
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm one of the weird people who believes that Paul Terry can only do good when she's coupled with a Balani artist.

01:50:51.695 --> 01:50:56.017
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I'm not hugely a big fan of this song.

01:50:56.237 --> 01:50:59.098
[SPEAKER_29]: The rest, pretty much the rest of that soundtrack is awesome.

01:50:59.138 --> 01:51:01.098
[SPEAKER_29]: Just one kind of video of the team.

01:51:01.118 --> 01:51:02.339
[SPEAKER_29]: So, I'm going with that.

01:51:02.359 --> 01:51:02.499
[SPEAKER_29]: Just

01:51:04.764 --> 01:51:05.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, let's recap.

01:51:05.944 --> 01:51:08.405
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about time to vote, but first let's recap.

01:51:08.485 --> 01:51:12.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember, you're going to send a private message to Sky with your vote, but here are the songs you can vote for tonight.

01:51:12.666 --> 01:51:16.087
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one is Jet Set, In the Name of Love.

01:51:19.908 --> 01:51:27.770
[SPEAKER_13]: And song number two you can vote for tonight is Gorillaz with Feel Good Inc.

01:51:28.671 --> 01:51:29.951
[SPEAKER_04]: It's my chocolate attack.

01:51:37.573 --> 01:51:41.595
[SPEAKER_02]: And song number three you can vote for tonight is Yozo Koshiro.

01:51:42.435 --> 01:51:43.616
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I get that right this time?

01:51:43.976 --> 01:51:44.636
[SPEAKER_26]: It's close enough.

01:51:44.856 --> 01:51:45.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Close enough.

01:51:45.677 --> 01:51:46.697
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring Paul and Terry.

01:51:46.757 --> 01:51:47.517
[SPEAKER_02]: I did that from memory.

01:51:48.137 --> 01:51:49.098
[SPEAKER_02]: Yozo Koshiro.

01:51:49.118 --> 01:51:49.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

01:51:49.818 --> 01:51:51.879
[SPEAKER_02]: Featuring Paul and Terry with Nothing Can Live Forever.

01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.862
[SPEAKER_02]: Place vote now.

01:52:07.002 --> 01:52:09.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Send a private message to Sky in the chat room with your vote.

01:52:09.903 --> 01:52:12.645
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one, song number two, song number three.

01:52:12.665 --> 01:52:14.266
[SPEAKER_29]: Wait, and a surprise fourth song.

01:52:15.067 --> 01:52:16.107
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

01:52:16.728 --> 01:52:17.588
[SPEAKER_29]: Sky the game.

01:52:17.688 --> 01:52:18.709
[SPEAKER_02]: No twist here, sorry.

01:52:19.309 --> 01:52:24.052
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, this is the part of the show where I would always ask, Loki, what's going on in the sim scene?

01:52:24.153 --> 01:52:27.615
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you've been keeping tabs on what's going on, but what's up, Loki?

01:52:30.430 --> 01:52:31.191
[SPEAKER_02]: Not a much.

01:52:32.592 --> 01:52:34.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, really nothing going on.

01:52:35.654 --> 01:52:38.816
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only a couple things I'd like to mention.

01:52:40.217 --> 01:52:47.182
[SPEAKER_02]: First off, as far as simpacks being released, not really too much this week.

01:52:47.943 --> 01:52:55.588
[SPEAKER_02]: However, there's this wonderful site that someone created because, I don't know if you remember, DDRAmerica.com, the old Belmonte Torrent site...

01:52:57.216 --> 01:52:57.797
[SPEAKER_02]: Alt-Control-Delete.com

01:53:16.393 --> 01:53:24.359
[SPEAKER_02]: BitTorrentTracker, and you've got some of the poppin' music soundtracks, and some 2DX.

01:53:24.639 --> 01:53:26.180
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mainly soundtrack rips right now.

01:53:27.401 --> 01:53:30.063
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I guess that's something worth mentioning.

01:53:31.564 --> 01:53:33.706
[SPEAKER_02]: Chatroom is yelling, BMS contest.

01:53:34.106 --> 01:53:37.649
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess this is something I think... Oh, yeah, but my cell's BMS contest.

01:53:37.669 --> 01:53:38.789
[SPEAKER_02]: They have that going on right now.

01:53:40.991 --> 01:53:41.852
[SPEAKER_02]: You sound excited.

01:53:43.004 --> 01:53:44.144
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, come on now, folks.

01:53:44.204 --> 01:53:48.406
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, really, I guess it could be cool.

01:53:49.026 --> 01:54:00.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but I just, you know, with the Japanese doing BMS files, I don't think USF is just going to be up to par with it.

01:54:00.731 --> 01:54:04.092
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, the Japanese have, like, got you beat by a lot.

01:54:05.758 --> 01:54:07.019
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my opinion on this stuff.

01:54:07.059 --> 01:54:15.649
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you play Japanese BMS files and you're like, holy crap, this stuff could have been in Beatmania or in 2DX or something.

01:54:15.689 --> 01:54:17.471
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just really high quality stuff.

01:54:17.762 --> 01:54:22.203
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, also there's more of a team mentality from what I understand.

01:54:22.483 --> 01:54:24.384
[SPEAKER_20]: It's set up like a professional production crew.

01:54:24.464 --> 01:54:33.267
[SPEAKER_20]: I bet if more of the American producers of the BMS files got together and put the same kind of effort into it, they could come up with a quality product.

01:54:33.287 --> 01:54:33.947
[SPEAKER_20]: It's like a food mix.

01:54:34.127 --> 01:54:37.208
[SPEAKER_02]: A food mix is a perfect example of production quality.

01:54:37.648 --> 01:54:39.328
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's just top-notch stuff right there.

01:54:39.548 --> 01:54:45.110
[SPEAKER_02]: You could honestly, if they had the permission, you could release a DDR mix of all food mix stuff, and it would...

01:54:46.161 --> 01:54:47.722
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't have to really change anything to it.

01:54:47.842 --> 01:54:48.862
[SPEAKER_02]: It would look great.

01:54:49.683 --> 01:54:55.525
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what's really cool about... And BMS stuff is exactly the same.

01:54:55.585 --> 01:54:57.566
[SPEAKER_02]: They do all their remixing stuff on there.

01:54:58.026 --> 01:55:02.288
[SPEAKER_02]: The production quality is incredibly awesome.

01:55:02.448 --> 01:55:12.212
[SPEAKER_02]: And even with stuff they only have movie files playing in the background, it's all just stop motion with bitmaps and JPEGs and stuff.

01:55:12.392 --> 01:55:13.713
[SPEAKER_02]: And it still looks incredible.

01:55:13.893 --> 01:55:14.193
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just...

01:55:15.296 --> 01:55:16.337
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even know how to describe it.

01:55:16.397 --> 01:55:16.877
[SPEAKER_02]: It's awesome.

01:55:16.917 --> 01:55:20.320
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like where Onuken and stuff got its start, is with BMS files.

01:55:21.100 --> 01:55:24.503
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really... I'm sorry, the U.S.

01:55:24.563 --> 01:55:25.684
[SPEAKER_02]: is not going to be able to come close.

01:55:26.064 --> 01:55:33.870
[SPEAKER_02]: They can try, but I already have high standards for BMS files, and I'm afraid, like most everything else that the U.S.

01:55:33.950 --> 01:55:35.491
[SPEAKER_02]: does as far as sim files go...

01:55:36.058 --> 01:55:37.119
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna be disappointed.

01:55:37.659 --> 01:55:42.303
[SPEAKER_02]: But, hey, you know, I'd like to still see what comes of this because it'll be interesting.

01:55:42.323 --> 01:55:45.486
[SPEAKER_02]: There's gotta be at least one quality file that comes with it.

01:55:45.526 --> 01:55:49.049
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm sure there's gonna be some good stuff, but there's gonna be some crap stuff too.

01:55:49.209 --> 01:55:52.352
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have the patience to make a StepMania file, let alone a BMS file.

01:55:52.652 --> 01:55:55.935
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I bet the three of us could get together and do a really good...

01:55:56.758 --> 01:55:57.359
[SPEAKER_20]: BMS.

01:55:58.220 --> 01:56:01.704
[SPEAKER_02]: There's better things we could spend our time doing, like eating.

01:56:01.944 --> 01:56:02.264
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

01:56:02.925 --> 01:56:03.385
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

01:56:05.528 --> 01:56:06.268
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, yeah.

01:56:06.949 --> 01:56:08.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Or working on our station or something.

01:56:08.751 --> 01:56:09.572
[SPEAKER_02]: Doing promos.

01:56:11.094 --> 01:56:11.394
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.

01:56:11.654 --> 01:56:12.315
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't do those.

01:56:14.158 --> 01:56:17.801
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so there's nothing really going on as far as that item is concerned.

01:56:20.744 --> 01:56:21.184
[SPEAKER_02]: What else?

01:56:21.544 --> 01:56:24.947
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, there's some more boss files released by DJ Pato.

01:56:25.568 --> 01:56:29.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Who, like most other people, call themselves DJ, is not a DJ.

01:56:30.792 --> 01:56:33.314
[SPEAKER_02]: And boss files are retarded, I like to mention.

01:56:35.396 --> 01:56:37.418
[SPEAKER_02]: For those who don't know what boss files are, they're incredibly hard...

01:56:40.014 --> 01:56:45.817
[SPEAKER_02]: and DWIs that are basically Beatmania for Stepmania, which is just crap.

01:56:46.097 --> 01:56:47.938
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crap, it's crap, it's crap.

01:56:48.358 --> 01:56:48.958
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't play them.

01:56:49.919 --> 01:56:58.723
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man, that's like the number one problem with Stepmania files out there on the internet is they're all trying to be Beatmania because nobody plays Stepmania with an actual dance pad.

01:56:58.743 --> 01:57:06.587
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all using their fingers, and when they AAA songs, they're taking screen gaps of it and posting how big their internet penis is because they AAA'd a song with their fingers on a dance game.

01:57:08.311 --> 01:57:11.474
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they complain because a lot of the ten-footers and stuff are too easy.

01:57:11.494 --> 01:57:13.536
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, because you're using your fingers, dumbass.

01:57:13.636 --> 01:57:14.376
[SPEAKER_02]: Try using your feet.

01:57:16.118 --> 01:57:16.618
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

01:57:17.039 --> 01:57:17.279
[SPEAKER_25]: Anyway.

01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:20.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, you guys want to hear who won tonight's cage match?

01:57:21.322 --> 01:57:21.663
[SPEAKER_11]: Sure!

01:57:22.640 --> 01:57:33.068
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, you know what's interesting is that last week I think we had the most number of votes I've ever seen in a cage match in recent memory, and this week we have some of the least number of votes in a cage match in recent memory, so I don't know what's up.

01:57:33.708 --> 01:57:34.148
[SPEAKER_02]: Family guy.

01:57:34.489 --> 01:57:34.729
[SPEAKER_02]: Huh?

01:57:35.049 --> 01:57:35.509
[SPEAKER_02]: Family guy.

01:57:35.709 --> 01:57:36.790
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it because of family guy?

01:57:37.090 --> 01:57:38.371
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, people.

01:57:38.491 --> 01:57:40.273
[SPEAKER_02]: It was leaked to the internet like two weeks ago.

01:57:40.293 --> 01:57:42.234
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I've had it on my PC all week.

01:57:43.135 --> 01:57:46.517
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a torrent later or stop being cheap and buy a TiVo.

01:57:46.857 --> 01:57:48.719
[SPEAKER_02]: We are far more important than that damn show.

01:57:48.739 --> 01:57:50.480
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll just cancel it again, and you'll be sad.

01:57:51.540 --> 01:57:53.121
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man, that show's awesome.

01:57:53.342 --> 01:57:55.203
[SPEAKER_02]: But our show's awesomer.

01:57:55.403 --> 01:57:56.424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right, we're awesomer.

01:57:56.965 --> 01:58:04.491
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, anyway, tonight's cage match winner is... In the name... Not in the name of love, my bad.

01:58:04.531 --> 01:58:05.792
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing can live forever.

01:58:05.812 --> 01:58:06.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.

01:58:07.753 --> 01:58:09.455
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought gorillas would have won the game.

01:58:09.495 --> 01:58:11.076
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuzo Koshiro.

01:58:12.992 --> 01:58:21.135
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, maybe on another night where everybody was voting, but tonight we only had... Oh my god, I was expecting this was a filler song until I picked a good one.

01:58:21.415 --> 01:58:22.235
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, it always works that way.

01:58:22.255 --> 01:58:26.957
[SPEAKER_20]: Just wait until after we get back from E3 and the Demon Days album is actually released so I can put that one song in.

01:58:27.317 --> 01:58:29.617
[SPEAKER_20]: Because I can't put it in before the album's out.

01:58:30.618 --> 01:58:31.498
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of support for the band.

01:58:32.781 --> 01:58:34.822
[SPEAKER_20]: I have to say it wasn't a bad song.

01:58:35.663 --> 01:58:37.283
[SPEAKER_02]: You could play it.

01:58:38.024 --> 01:58:39.864
[SPEAKER_02]: I will actually go ahead and say it was a bad song.

01:58:43.086 --> 01:58:44.166
[SPEAKER_18]: I could, but I won't.

01:58:44.186 --> 01:58:46.287
[SPEAKER_02]: I know right away it was a bad song.

01:58:46.307 --> 01:58:47.268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I put it in.

01:58:48.848 --> 01:58:51.470
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't see how you could call my song repetitive and then put that in.

01:58:52.210 --> 01:58:53.631
[SPEAKER_20]: I could play it, but I won't.

01:58:53.891 --> 01:58:55.411
[SPEAKER_20]: Out of respect for my favorite band.

01:58:57.032 --> 01:58:57.572
[SPEAKER_02]: I could play it.

01:58:58.873 --> 01:58:59.373
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm teasing.

01:58:59.873 --> 01:59:00.113
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway,

01:59:02.130 --> 01:59:02.530
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

01:59:03.111 --> 01:59:03.791
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do now?

01:59:03.952 --> 01:59:06.834
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I want to do the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

01:59:06.854 --> 01:59:09.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this is exciting.

01:59:09.216 --> 01:59:14.840
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, DDR Freak does run our Rewinds every Friday night over on The Freak.

01:59:15.301 --> 01:59:16.782
[SPEAKER_02]: So you guys should check that out.

01:59:17.623 --> 01:59:23.207
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever miss part of this show, so if you must skip us and go watch Family Guy...

01:59:24.808 --> 01:59:28.010
[SPEAKER_02]: I suppose you could catch up with us on Friday night over on DDR Free.

01:59:28.170 --> 01:59:31.732
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on the same week now, so tonight's show you will hear this Friday.

01:59:31.752 --> 01:59:32.833
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to wait a week anymore.

01:59:33.153 --> 01:59:37.215
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, folks, I mean, you could download this DVD quality on the internet.

01:59:37.596 --> 01:59:38.496
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on my PSP.

01:59:38.696 --> 01:59:39.977
[SPEAKER_02]: We watched it yesterday.

01:59:39.997 --> 01:59:41.778
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, I watched it on Loki's PSP already.

01:59:41.838 --> 01:59:44.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and granted, it was very funny.

01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:47.982
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still the same level of funny as it used to be.

01:59:48.002 --> 01:59:53.725
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, it's really funny, and I highly recommend it, but because it's against our show, I'm sorry, but you can't go.

01:59:55.094 --> 01:59:55.774
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, folks.

01:59:55.814 --> 01:59:56.535
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll rerun it.

01:59:57.075 --> 01:59:58.176
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they'll rerun it.

01:59:58.636 --> 02:00:00.097
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it on BitTorrent.

02:00:00.417 --> 02:00:02.378
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get it TiVo, stopping cheap.

02:00:02.538 --> 02:00:03.639
[SPEAKER_02]: Set your VCR.

02:00:05.900 --> 02:00:08.522
[SPEAKER_02]: Or tape us, I suppose, but it's a little harder to tape the internet.

02:00:08.622 --> 02:00:12.844
[SPEAKER_02]: Or buy Satellite and, you know, watch it East Coast time.

02:00:12.864 --> 02:00:13.224
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.

02:00:13.304 --> 02:00:15.326
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go, because East Coast people saw it before our show was on.

02:00:15.486 --> 02:00:15.866
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:00:16.086 --> 02:00:19.228
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, let's get to the DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:00:22.072 --> 02:00:27.216
[SPEAKER_02]: A bunch of crazies over there on DDR Freak.

02:00:27.396 --> 02:00:27.896
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.

02:00:28.476 --> 02:00:30.037
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some really great people on DDR Freak.

02:00:30.057 --> 02:00:33.200
[SPEAKER_02]: But once in a while, you get a few loonies that make very interesting posts.

02:00:33.520 --> 02:00:36.522
[SPEAKER_02]: And tonight's DDR Freak Post of the Week was suggested to me by one of our chatters.

02:00:36.982 --> 02:00:40.965
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was LXLDubes that suggested this one.

02:00:41.185 --> 02:00:43.466
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it wasn't you and it was somebody else, I apologize to that person.

02:00:43.587 --> 02:00:44.067
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was him.

02:00:46.048 --> 02:00:46.248
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:00:47.289 --> 02:00:47.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

02:00:47.829 --> 02:00:50.251
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, Post of the Week, this is not TurboGrafx segment.

02:00:50.271 --> 02:00:51.292
[SPEAKER_02]: This is DDR Freak Post of the Week.

02:00:51.312 --> 02:00:51.492
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

02:00:53.929 --> 02:00:54.610
[SPEAKER_02]: Subject.

02:00:55.270 --> 02:00:56.571
[SPEAKER_02]: The subject for this post.

02:00:57.392 --> 02:00:59.094
[SPEAKER_02]: DDR Fairy Tales.

02:00:59.794 --> 02:01:03.618
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I came so close to locking that damn thread, and then I thought, nah.

02:01:03.938 --> 02:01:04.438
[SPEAKER_02]: Here it is.

02:01:05.079 --> 02:01:05.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the post.

02:01:06.400 --> 02:01:08.722
[SPEAKER_02]: I just thought this would be a funny idea.

02:01:09.382 --> 02:01:14.727
[SPEAKER_02]: Try to make a random fairy tale out of as many DDR song titles as possible.

02:01:15.147 --> 02:01:15.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.

02:01:16.989 --> 02:01:20.252
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, okay, that post isn't that great, but let's see some of the replies.

02:01:22.419 --> 02:01:28.625
[SPEAKER_30]: Once upon a time, in the kingdom of Max 300, there was a noble prince named Jam Jam Reggae.

02:01:30.967 --> 02:01:33.289
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, Yam Yam Ragu.

02:01:34.210 --> 02:01:35.752
[SPEAKER_30]: What the hell was that?

02:01:36.192 --> 02:01:38.674
[SPEAKER_30]: I don't know anybody named Jam Jam Reggae, do you?

02:01:39.315 --> 02:01:40.456
[SPEAKER_30]: Makes no sense whatsoever.

02:01:42.918 --> 02:01:43.539
[SPEAKER_30]: Uh, let's see.

02:01:44.481 --> 02:01:55.308
[SPEAKER_02]: Once upon a time, a prince upon a star, which is a Beatmania song, not a DDR song, visited the Queens, Jamaica, again, Beatmania, not DDR, where he met a man named Gamble.

02:01:55.388 --> 02:02:01.311
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to get technical, you know, they were in a club mix, whatever.

02:02:01.892 --> 02:02:03.293
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, he met a man named Gamble.

02:02:03.433 --> 02:02:04.773
[SPEAKER_02]: But these songs weren't made famous.

02:02:05.794 --> 02:02:06.955
[SPEAKER_02]: They were first in Beatmania.

02:02:06.975 --> 02:02:07.255
[SPEAKER_02]: Shut up.

02:02:07.851 --> 02:02:11.153
[SPEAKER_02]: This man had a lovely senorita named Nori Nori Nori.

02:02:11.553 --> 02:02:16.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Then they all died because they got ran over by a cowgirl going maximum overdrive.

02:02:16.256 --> 02:02:16.696
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

02:02:19.518 --> 02:02:24.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, these share the same place in my heart as with those three-word stories.

02:02:26.522 --> 02:02:32.046
[SPEAKER_02]: There was one that went on for like a whole page, and if you think I'm reading it, you're freaking crazy.

02:02:33.226 --> 02:02:34.187
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll read one more here.

02:02:35.128 --> 02:02:35.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.

02:02:39.362 --> 02:02:43.325
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this was Alex L. Dubes that recommended it because he made a post in here.

02:02:43.345 --> 02:02:45.807
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, DDR fairy tales, ooh, ooh, let me try.

02:02:46.087 --> 02:02:48.189
[SPEAKER_02]: There once was a village of people who had no life.

02:02:48.229 --> 02:02:50.651
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a surprise, there was a DDR machine in the village.

02:02:53.092 --> 02:02:53.793
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's good.

02:02:54.493 --> 02:02:56.835
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what we need to actually do instead of the fairy tales?

02:02:56.875 --> 02:02:58.036
[SPEAKER_20]: We need DDR limericks.

02:02:58.957 --> 02:02:59.637
[SPEAKER_20]: Dirty ones.

02:03:00.017 --> 02:03:01.338
[SPEAKER_02]: Dirty DDR limericks?

02:03:01.739 --> 02:03:01.959
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:03:01.979 --> 02:03:02.059
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah.

02:03:02.887 --> 02:03:04.788
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this one starts out, it might sound dirty.

02:03:04.808 --> 02:03:06.450
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the last one I'm going to read.

02:03:06.890 --> 02:03:09.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Once upon a time, there was a man named Max, period.

02:03:10.212 --> 02:03:12.374
[SPEAKER_02]: He went up to a La Senorita.

02:03:12.754 --> 02:03:14.395
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, he yelled.

02:03:17.177 --> 02:03:19.819
[SPEAKER_30]: I think buenos dias should be a DDR song.

02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:21.820
[SPEAKER_30]: Buenos dias!

02:03:24.803 --> 02:03:25.503
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god.

02:03:25.863 --> 02:03:30.006
[SPEAKER_08]: They needed a Spanish version of Max.

02:03:30.607 --> 02:03:30.867
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:03:31.007 --> 02:03:32.448
[SPEAKER_02]: They needed a Spanish version of Max.

02:03:36.706 --> 02:03:37.147
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry.

02:03:37.427 --> 02:03:38.588
[SPEAKER_02]: He went up to a La Senorita.

02:03:38.628 --> 02:03:39.849
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, he yelled.

02:03:40.209 --> 02:03:41.811
[SPEAKER_02]: He then offered her some candy.

02:03:42.551 --> 02:03:46.314
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, in a wild rush, she began to scream, waka laka.

02:03:46.855 --> 02:03:48.356
[SPEAKER_02]: Max yelled, don't break down.

02:03:48.816 --> 02:03:50.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait a minute, she screamed.

02:03:50.598 --> 02:03:51.799
[SPEAKER_02]: You have broken my heart.

02:03:52.359 --> 02:03:55.081
[SPEAKER_02]: He then began to feel like he hit a dead end.

02:03:55.562 --> 02:03:58.084
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been cheating on me, huh, Max, period, she screamed.

02:03:58.786 --> 02:04:00.747
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to share my love, he responded.

02:04:01.107 --> 02:04:02.448
[SPEAKER_02]: Nothing gonna stop, he added.

02:04:02.889 --> 02:04:04.670
[SPEAKER_02]: She then said, make love to me.

02:04:05.290 --> 02:04:07.331
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflex took over and they banged.

02:04:07.651 --> 02:04:08.732
[SPEAKER_02]: The end of the century.

02:04:10.773 --> 02:04:11.734
[SPEAKER_20]: Okay, that one's good.

02:04:11.814 --> 02:04:12.394
[SPEAKER_20]: That one's good.

02:04:13.495 --> 02:04:15.716
[SPEAKER_20]: That one wins a lack of angst for me.

02:04:18.478 --> 02:04:20.719
[SPEAKER_30]: The reflex took over and, well, they banged.

02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:22.540
[SPEAKER_30]: Buenos dias!

02:04:23.281 --> 02:04:24.462
[SPEAKER_15]: Buenos dias!

02:04:31.836 --> 02:04:34.096
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the way people write on DDR free.

02:04:34.496 --> 02:04:36.857
[SPEAKER_02]: The reflex took over and, you know, they banged.

02:04:40.778 --> 02:04:41.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Did she bang?

02:04:43.179 --> 02:04:47.900
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment from our chat room and VXJasonXV really wants me to read this because he's posted it three times.

02:04:48.420 --> 02:04:53.242
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought it was a fairy tale, not a retardation and bastardization of song titles.

02:04:54.402 --> 02:04:55.683
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, Jason.

02:04:55.723 --> 02:04:56.583
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias.

02:04:58.460 --> 02:05:00.480
[SPEAKER_02]: Fairy Tailgate because it's a song.

02:05:03.481 --> 02:05:04.201
[SPEAKER_30]: Let's go to break.

02:05:07.462 --> 02:05:09.422
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break, we're going to hear... You know what?

02:05:09.482 --> 02:05:12.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that I've said... Oh, wait.

02:05:13.003 --> 02:05:14.343
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got to talk about something.

02:05:14.363 --> 02:05:14.883
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what?

02:05:15.723 --> 02:05:18.764
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that we posted something about Karaoke Revolution?

02:05:19.444 --> 02:05:21.104
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, what do you want to say about Karaoke Revolution?

02:05:21.844 --> 02:05:24.164
[SPEAKER_02]: There's that song from Dirty Dancing in it.

02:05:24.585 --> 02:05:26.665
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm scared because there's a Karaoke Revolution 4.

02:05:27.762 --> 02:05:28.082
[SPEAKER_02]: The end.

02:05:57.395 --> 02:05:58.737
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, Max 300.

02:05:58.797 --> 02:06:00.459
[SPEAKER_02]: Buenos dias, El Bimbo.

02:06:00.780 --> 02:06:02.422
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be back after this with more Orange Lounge.

02:06:27.368 --> 02:06:28.408
Thanks for watching!

02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:03.320
Thanks for watching!

02:07:42.798 --> 02:07:43.861
Thanks for watching!

02:09:03.703 --> 02:09:04.612
[SPEAKER_13]: Now this is...

02:09:36.531 --> 02:09:37.892
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen

02:10:13.488 --> 02:10:13.908
Check it out.

02:11:02.722 --> 02:11:07.816
[SPEAKER_13]: Why do you cry when you're happy It's just something special

02:12:19.813 --> 02:12:24.614
[SPEAKER_13]: From StepSquad to OrangeLounge, this PDR sucks!

02:12:24.994 --> 02:12:29.676
[SPEAKER_13]: Holler!

02:12:30.616 --> 02:12:40.358
[SPEAKER_02]: P-T-P-O Hi, we're back here on Orange Lounge Radio, episode number 140 in progress.

02:12:41.139 --> 02:12:45.720
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to get into the FUs of the week relatively shortly, but first... Cool.

02:12:46.607 --> 02:12:46.988
[SPEAKER_02]: SILENT HILL Um...

02:13:04.694 --> 02:13:08.516
[SPEAKER_20]: Really, my updates are just from over the week.

02:13:09.136 --> 02:13:11.538
[SPEAKER_20]: The basic story, of course, has been out on the web for some time.

02:13:12.318 --> 02:13:13.398
[SPEAKER_20]: They're in pre-production now.

02:13:14.979 --> 02:13:17.420
[SPEAKER_02]: For the Silent Hill movie, correct?

02:13:17.521 --> 02:13:20.702
[SPEAKER_20]: So far, cast is Radha Mitchell from Finding Neverland.

02:13:21.042 --> 02:13:24.304
[SPEAKER_20]: Sean Bean is in it as her character's husband.

02:13:26.165 --> 02:13:28.506
[SPEAKER_20]: For Lord of the Rings fans, he was Boromir.

02:13:29.387 --> 02:13:33.609
[SPEAKER_20]: And then somebody named Jodell Ferlin as the daughter in the movie.

02:13:34.921 --> 02:13:40.684
[SPEAKER_20]: But there's a... They were saying in this one article, and I'll link it in the chat room in just a moment.

02:13:42.625 --> 02:13:51.469
[SPEAKER_20]: They had the production cost, I think it's... It's expected to top $25,000 per day during the shoot.

02:13:52.129 --> 02:13:55.491
[SPEAKER_20]: So it's going to be, of course, several million dollars to produce this movie.

02:13:55.511 --> 02:13:56.511
[SPEAKER_20]: They've got big hopes for it.

02:13:57.772 --> 02:13:59.193
[SPEAKER_20]: There are pictures out on the net...

02:14:00.106 --> 02:14:04.108
[SPEAKER_20]: Trying to find the link I had that had like 60 some odd pre-production pictures.

02:14:04.128 --> 02:14:07.830
[SPEAKER_02]: There actually is a link on OrangeScienceRadio.com and the story we ran earlier this week has a link to it.

02:14:08.251 --> 02:14:09.631
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's still valid, which I think it is.

02:14:10.092 --> 02:14:10.932
[SPEAKER_20]: Actually, I do believe it is.

02:14:11.913 --> 02:14:15.274
[SPEAKER_20]: But I'm also going to copy this article for the chat room.

02:14:15.375 --> 02:14:16.075
[SPEAKER_20]: It's really good.

02:14:17.696 --> 02:14:22.418
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's talking about actually the town that they're filming it in and how the people are reacting to it.

02:14:24.259 --> 02:14:24.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.

02:14:25.340 --> 02:14:25.700
[SPEAKER_02]: There it is.

02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.641
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that movie very much.

02:14:27.841 --> 02:14:28.302
[SPEAKER_02]: It should be...

02:14:30.606 --> 02:14:32.727
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping that they stay loyal to the games.

02:14:33.128 --> 02:14:36.129
[SPEAKER_02]: If they stay loyal to the games, it'll be so cool.

02:14:37.110 --> 02:14:39.711
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they try to do the Resident Evil thing, it's going to suck.

02:14:40.091 --> 02:14:43.593
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really hope they don't turn it into like zombie horror action film.

02:14:45.414 --> 02:14:47.596
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, kind of that subtle mess with your mind.

02:14:47.676 --> 02:14:51.198
[SPEAKER_20]: I think it's going to stay with the way the games are, honestly.

02:14:51.758 --> 02:14:53.299
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hopeful from the pictures.

02:14:53.459 --> 02:14:53.819
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very hopeful.

02:14:53.839 --> 02:14:55.540
[SPEAKER_20]: It doesn't seem like it's exactly the same.

02:14:55.660 --> 02:14:59.282
[SPEAKER_20]: Because you know how in the games everybody is linked to the whole...

02:15:04.250 --> 02:15:11.593
[SPEAKER_20]: This one seems almost like it would be an innocent bystander just caught up in what's going on, from what I can tell.

02:15:12.294 --> 02:15:12.974
[SPEAKER_20]: It's looking pretty cool.

02:15:14.175 --> 02:15:15.275
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hoping it comes out soon.

02:15:15.295 --> 02:15:17.476
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's not out until next year, but you never know what might happen.

02:15:18.237 --> 02:15:18.657
[SPEAKER_20]: I need this.

02:15:19.678 --> 02:15:22.380
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, it's time for the FUs of the week, boys and girls.

02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:28.464
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to send in an FU of the week, send your private message to Sky in the chat room with whatever you want to give an FU to.

02:15:28.504 --> 02:15:31.666
[SPEAKER_02]: Please keep them short, as we've got a lot of people that probably want to get their FUs in.

02:15:32.106 --> 02:15:34.808
[SPEAKER_02]: If your FU goes on and on and on, you will get cut off!

02:15:35.649 --> 02:15:36.249
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.

02:15:36.669 --> 02:15:38.090
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to read your FU anyway.

02:15:39.091 --> 02:15:41.112
[SPEAKER_02]: But we will, because we know you're angsty like us.

02:15:41.473 --> 02:15:45.015
[SPEAKER_02]: So DarkSakura, why is it that we do the FUs of the week every single week?

02:15:46.936 --> 02:15:48.177
[SPEAKER_20]: Because Jamie can't have chocolate.

02:16:05.728 --> 02:16:09.911
[SPEAKER_20]: Fuck you to car accidents and all the shit that's happened in my car, god damn it.

02:16:10.731 --> 02:16:14.093
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I loved my CD player even though it was a piece of shit.

02:16:14.853 --> 02:16:17.735
[SPEAKER_20]: And I loved my car even though it's also a piece of shit.

02:16:18.590 --> 02:16:20.931
[SPEAKER_20]: But I didn't need to be in the goddamn accident.

02:16:21.171 --> 02:16:27.712
[SPEAKER_20]: I certainly am tired of not being able to walk up a damn flight of stairs because my hip hurts like in excruciating pain.

02:16:27.732 --> 02:16:31.413
[SPEAKER_20]: This is after Vicodin and Flexerol, so fuck the whole thing.

02:16:31.453 --> 02:16:32.793
[SPEAKER_20]: This is what I'm angsty about.

02:16:33.534 --> 02:16:39.835
[SPEAKER_20]: And also, I hate taking the medication anyway because it makes my head feel all funny.

02:16:40.095 --> 02:16:43.776
[SPEAKER_20]: And when my head feels funny, I tend to say weird things and tend to just go off on people.

02:16:44.235 --> 02:17:03.475
[SPEAKER_20]: and I went off on people at work and that's not good so I ended up going home because I went off on people um just I hate feeling like this I hate the crap that's happening in my car and honestly I wish that someone would just run into my car with a semi so that their insurance would buy me a brand new fucking car

02:17:04.565 --> 02:17:08.526
[SPEAKER_20]: Also, F you to my apartment complex and the stupid bitch that manages it.

02:17:08.886 --> 02:17:14.828
[SPEAKER_20]: She doesn't do her job for shit and keeps letting these wannabe thug gangsters move in next door.

02:17:15.489 --> 02:17:17.309
[SPEAKER_20]: And it's no longer a safe place to live.

02:17:17.389 --> 02:17:24.372
[SPEAKER_20]: I also fucking hate the stupid cost of houses in this state, especially in Sacramento.

02:17:24.572 --> 02:17:26.432
[SPEAKER_20]: The Bay Area, of course, is a lot more expensive.

02:17:26.953 --> 02:17:28.873
[SPEAKER_20]: But it's hard to find a house for under $350,000.

02:17:29.393 --> 02:17:34.155
[SPEAKER_20]: And if we have to move out to Yuba City to freaking have a house

02:17:34.730 --> 02:17:42.052
[SPEAKER_20]: that is worth a damn and not have to, you know, pay everything for the rest of our lives to have this house, then so be it.

02:17:42.092 --> 02:17:49.235
[SPEAKER_20]: You know, I'll put up with the extra drive, but I did find a cute house, though, but it's small and they want a bunch for it.

02:17:49.935 --> 02:17:51.395
[SPEAKER_20]: It's just a nightmare, you know.

02:17:52.516 --> 02:17:54.116
[SPEAKER_20]: I fucking hate growing up now.

02:17:54.876 --> 02:17:56.597
[SPEAKER_20]: Isn't this going to be nice to have a house?

02:17:57.397 --> 02:18:00.898
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, life's going to suck when you grow up, when you grow up, when you grow up.

02:18:03.019 --> 02:18:03.099
[SPEAKER_20]: Ugh.

02:18:06.327 --> 02:18:13.833
[SPEAKER_20]: All of you kids in the chatroom, you have no right to complain about living with your parents because you don't have to pay for shit.

02:18:14.953 --> 02:18:19.417
[SPEAKER_20]: If I hear you bitching one more time, I'm going to come to your house and slap you upside the head.

02:18:19.657 --> 02:18:22.700
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you aren't paying the mortgage by yourself, then you can't bitch.

02:18:22.900 --> 02:18:23.681
[SPEAKER_20]: Or pay rent.

02:18:24.902 --> 02:18:27.183
[SPEAKER_20]: And even then, you can move out when you're fucking 18.

02:18:28.308 --> 02:18:30.969
[SPEAKER_20]: Although I don't recommend it, live with your parents as long as you can.

02:18:31.049 --> 02:18:33.070
[SPEAKER_20]: Milk them for every cent they're worth.

02:18:33.830 --> 02:18:36.411
[SPEAKER_20]: Because it's such when you have to do it all by yourself.

02:18:37.812 --> 02:18:38.152
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm done.

02:18:39.593 --> 02:18:40.073
[SPEAKER_30]: Loki.

02:18:44.795 --> 02:18:46.516
[SPEAKER_30]: Chocolate good.

02:18:48.316 --> 02:18:48.937
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but anyways.

02:18:49.317 --> 02:18:50.397
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the chocolate's gone.

02:18:52.558 --> 02:18:53.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I need more chocolate.

02:18:53.899 --> 02:18:54.379
[SPEAKER_02]: Now.

02:18:54.739 --> 02:18:55.059
[SPEAKER_02]: That.

02:18:55.539 --> 02:18:55.840
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

02:18:57.395 --> 02:19:05.266
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I was, um, I'm very pissed off at the fact of just my weekends being, in general, like, too busy for me.

02:19:05.306 --> 02:19:08.271
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even get a chance to actually, like, relax during the whole weekend.

02:19:09.673 --> 02:19:10.534
[SPEAKER_02]: No other peanut butter cups.

02:19:10.694 --> 02:19:11.695
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate peanut butter cups.

02:19:12.076 --> 02:19:13.418
[SPEAKER_02]: I like expensive chocolates.

02:19:17.340 --> 02:19:19.802
[SPEAKER_02]: I like non-expensive chocolates that used to be expensive.

02:19:20.202 --> 02:19:24.946
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, um... So fuck you to goddamn weekends being too damn long.

02:19:25.286 --> 02:19:31.011
[SPEAKER_02]: And fuck you to having to drive... Just... Stressful, okay?

02:19:33.192 --> 02:19:33.653
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you!

02:19:34.754 --> 02:19:35.454
[SPEAKER_02]: I get more chocolates.

02:19:36.475 --> 02:19:37.696
[SPEAKER_02]: Um... Anyways...

02:19:38.086 --> 02:19:41.088
[SPEAKER_02]: Fuck you to bad drivers, because they're everywhere.

02:19:41.728 --> 02:19:42.609
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere, everywhere.

02:19:42.669 --> 02:19:49.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I was coming home from dropping off Rob yesterday, and this guy zips past me at like 50 miles an hour faster than where I'm going.

02:19:49.754 --> 02:19:52.836
[SPEAKER_02]: Granted, I'm going about 75 on the freeway.

02:19:53.176 --> 02:19:56.598
[SPEAKER_02]: He's just all... No, I was in the car when that happened.

02:19:56.718 --> 02:19:57.599
[SPEAKER_02]: That guy was crazy.

02:19:57.839 --> 02:19:59.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't even know what that was.

02:19:59.560 --> 02:20:00.841
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that was just nuts.

02:20:02.338 --> 02:20:06.280
[SPEAKER_02]: People, honestly, I mean, I see, I'm going like, you know, 75 or something.

02:20:06.340 --> 02:20:11.522
[SPEAKER_02]: I consider that pretty, you know, that's some pretty good speeding right there.

02:20:11.542 --> 02:20:14.924
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you don't want to go crazy because, you know, there's a lot of cars out there.

02:20:15.004 --> 02:20:16.985
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's people that are zooming past me, you know.

02:20:17.560 --> 02:20:31.761
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like, nothing, you know, I don't understand why everyone's in such a hurry nowadays, and it was funny though, today, one person did just like the same thing, you know, zoomed right past me, and then a cop car zoomed right past me and pulled the sucker over.

02:20:32.522 --> 02:20:33.143
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that was great.

02:20:34.464 --> 02:20:43.354
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, then, um, what was that, I was gonna say, um, fuck you to, uh, Live365 for not giving me more, uh, free crap.

02:20:43.875 --> 02:20:47.259
[SPEAKER_02]: I like free crap, and all I got was a stupid t-shirt that I'm probably not gonna wear.

02:20:48.041 --> 02:20:49.643
[SPEAKER_02]: Last year we had a lot more free crap.

02:20:49.884 --> 02:20:51.346
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a lot more free crap last year.

02:20:51.386 --> 02:20:53.429
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very disappointed at the lack of free crap this year.

02:20:53.449 --> 02:20:57.074
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just like, I'm trying to figure out why, what exactly cost the $20.

02:20:57.755 --> 02:20:59.177
[SPEAKER_02]: What am I getting for this $20?

02:20:59.217 --> 02:20:59.938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I want to know.

02:20:59.978 --> 02:21:04.485
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to see that girl sing those dirty ass lyrics about that guy being up all in her.

02:21:06.010 --> 02:21:10.233
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I wasn't that guy all up in her, so it wasn't really, you know, worth the $20.

02:21:10.293 --> 02:21:12.275
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm trying to say.

02:21:12.295 --> 02:21:17.238
[SPEAKER_02]: If you'd gotten a chance to go up all in her, and she wrote that song about you, would it have been worth the $20?

02:21:17.278 --> 02:21:18.479
[SPEAKER_02]: That would have been worth the $20.

02:21:19.500 --> 02:21:20.420
[SPEAKER_29]: I got two things.

02:21:20.741 --> 02:21:22.442
[SPEAKER_29]: One, I've got a bunch of free crap coming.

02:21:22.462 --> 02:21:23.643
[SPEAKER_29]: You can have it free.

02:21:23.843 --> 02:21:26.985
[SPEAKER_29]: I'll drop it in the toilet or something if you want.

02:21:27.005 --> 02:21:27.806
[SPEAKER_29]: Two, hold on, two.

02:21:28.328 --> 02:21:33.913
[SPEAKER_29]: You guys have to pay to go to the awards, even though you are on the ballot, so to speak.

02:21:34.273 --> 02:21:36.294
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's play a fun game, LankyStyle.

02:21:36.535 --> 02:21:38.977
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's play how much was each ticket.

02:21:39.017 --> 02:21:44.021
[SPEAKER_02]: No, better yet, let's play how much did it cost for all three of us to go to the awards ceremony.

02:21:44.501 --> 02:21:45.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Guess now.

02:21:45.222 --> 02:21:45.202
$100.

02:21:45.582 --> 02:21:45.662
[SPEAKER_02]: Less.

02:21:49.099 --> 02:21:49.539
[SPEAKER_02]: 75.

02:21:49.239 --> 02:21:49.539
[SPEAKER_02]: Less.

02:21:50.019 --> 02:21:50.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, this is no fun.

02:21:50.780 --> 02:21:51.460
[SPEAKER_02]: He's guessing high.

02:21:52.120 --> 02:21:53.100
[SPEAKER_29]: I'm including gas.

02:21:53.380 --> 02:21:53.741
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:21:53.761 --> 02:21:53.881
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.

02:21:53.921 --> 02:21:54.561
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, shit.

02:21:54.601 --> 02:21:55.201
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're including gas.

02:21:55.221 --> 02:21:55.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just the tickets?

02:21:55.901 --> 02:21:56.521
[SPEAKER_02]: Just the tickets.

02:21:56.541 --> 02:21:57.062
[SPEAKER_02]: Tickets alone.

02:21:57.082 --> 02:21:57.062
60.

02:21:58.022 --> 02:21:58.362
[SPEAKER_02]: Bingo.

02:21:58.382 --> 02:21:58.362
$60.

02:21:58.462 --> 02:21:59.322
[SPEAKER_29]: Because you said 20.

02:21:59.682 --> 02:22:00.183
[SPEAKER_29]: I got that.

02:22:00.203 --> 02:22:00.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sorry.

02:22:00.923 --> 02:22:01.783
[SPEAKER_02]: I forgot you knew math.

02:22:02.883 --> 02:22:03.884
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

02:22:04.004 --> 02:22:11.646
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, fuck you to the Embassy Suites Hotel having their stupid... Okay, now their wireless...

02:22:12.057 --> 02:22:16.100
[SPEAKER_02]: Internet there or whatever that was that I was trying to jump onto with my PSP.

02:22:16.520 --> 02:22:19.742
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, password free, but it wasn't letting me connect for some reason.

02:22:19.782 --> 02:22:20.622
[SPEAKER_02]: That pissed me off.

02:22:20.723 --> 02:22:22.083
[SPEAKER_02]: Damn those protected internets.

02:22:22.103 --> 02:22:30.789
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I wanted to jump onto the chat room that was in the Live365 and write dirty stuff, but I couldn't do that, so that made me sad.

02:22:32.870 --> 02:22:37.053
[SPEAKER_02]: And then fuck you to Oakland for sucking, for being really ghetto.

02:22:37.713 --> 02:22:38.514
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate Oakland.

02:22:39.544 --> 02:22:46.609
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, um, also, fuck you to Comcast for taking a week to fix my internet.

02:22:47.729 --> 02:22:48.090
[SPEAKER_02]: You suck.

02:22:48.530 --> 02:22:53.513
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least the guy that we got, that came out and fixed it, knew what was going on, so that's always good.

02:22:53.533 --> 02:22:55.114
[SPEAKER_02]: You get one of those, like, every now and then.

02:22:55.134 --> 02:22:56.715
[SPEAKER_02]: A Comcast employee knew what they were doing?

02:22:57.175 --> 02:22:59.537
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, hey, you know they happen every now and then.

02:23:00.578 --> 02:23:04.040
[SPEAKER_20]: I guess for, uh, it's chaos theory.

02:23:04.060 --> 02:23:05.301
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, exactly.

02:23:05.361 --> 02:23:05.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.

02:23:06.755 --> 02:23:08.956
[SPEAKER_02]: So, there are the few, the select few.

02:23:09.216 --> 02:23:11.477
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we love Comcast, we really do.

02:23:11.557 --> 02:23:13.258
[SPEAKER_02]: Please don't pull the plug, please don't pull the plug.

02:23:15.218 --> 02:23:21.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and also, fuck you, Zach B., for just putting a picture of my leg.

02:23:23.502 --> 02:23:25.102
[SPEAKER_08]: I can understand, okay.

02:23:25.142 --> 02:23:26.903
[SPEAKER_08]: Be glad at least your leg got in there.

02:23:26.943 --> 02:23:31.645
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a good shot, it was an action shot, but the next page they have a picture of Rob's face.

02:23:32.485 --> 02:23:33.606
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what about my face?

02:23:34.196 --> 02:23:35.137
[SPEAKER_02]: No one knows what I look like.

02:23:35.337 --> 02:23:36.498
[SPEAKER_02]: I am just a floating leg.

02:23:36.738 --> 02:23:38.720
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's semi-transparent, mind you.

02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:40.621
[SPEAKER_02]: That just goes to prove I'm sexier.

02:23:42.143 --> 02:23:42.743
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding.

02:23:42.843 --> 02:23:43.784
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't... I'm sorry.

02:23:43.804 --> 02:23:45.726
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see the way I looked in that picture, though?

02:23:45.806 --> 02:23:49.529
[SPEAKER_22]: I'm like... I don't know if it was just me or not, but he looked like a freaking Sasquatch.

02:23:50.319 --> 02:23:53.202
[SPEAKER_22]: I swear, his eyebrows look... Yeah, Rob.

02:23:53.602 --> 02:24:00.288
[SPEAKER_29]: No, it's just like, I don't know what it was, but your eyebrows looked especially white in the picture, so you look like... I had big, bushy eyebrows.

02:24:00.448 --> 02:24:08.535
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't have... Okay, for anybody who hasn't seen Rob, which I'm pretty sure... Well, I'm on the camera right now, so it's dark as hell in here, so they can't see anything.

02:24:08.555 --> 02:24:09.956
[SPEAKER_29]: Like, you don't have white eyebrows.

02:24:10.586 --> 02:24:15.689
[SPEAKER_29]: I don't know what happened with that picture, but it looked like you seriously had no eyebrows, because they looked like they were shaving off and everything.

02:24:15.709 --> 02:24:18.611
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, maybe they had to Photoshop me, because my hideous face!

02:24:18.951 --> 02:24:22.833
[SPEAKER_29]: They're like, this guy's actually better looking than most radio personalities.

02:24:22.853 --> 02:24:23.894
[SPEAKER_29]: We've got to make him look bad.

02:24:28.136 --> 02:24:32.179
[SPEAKER_02]: Using crime technology, we're going to age him to look like Sasquatch.

02:24:33.640 --> 02:24:34.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

02:24:45.478 --> 02:24:49.660
[SPEAKER_02]: An F you to the fact that moving out took me like three weeks to do, but I'm very happy it's over now.

02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.521
[SPEAKER_02]: An F you to the fact that we probably won't get the deposit back because landlords are cunts.

02:24:53.901 --> 02:24:55.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, our old landlords are pretty decent.

02:24:56.042 --> 02:24:56.782
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't knock them.

02:24:56.822 --> 02:24:57.462
[SPEAKER_02]: They were decent.

02:24:57.982 --> 02:25:00.303
[SPEAKER_02]: But we'll see if we get the deposit back or not.

02:25:00.723 --> 02:25:04.064
[SPEAKER_02]: And I may be back here in three weeks saying that they are bitches, but we'll see.

02:25:05.985 --> 02:25:07.806
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, F you to that.

02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:13.308
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the fact that I really don't feel like I had a vacation, even though I've had three days off of work.

02:25:13.328 --> 02:25:14.488
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've had like a five-day weekend.

02:25:14.813 --> 02:25:16.214
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't feel like I had a vacation at all.

02:25:17.195 --> 02:25:19.596
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still tired, and I'm like, oh my god, I have to go to work tomorrow?

02:25:19.616 --> 02:25:20.197
[SPEAKER_02]: Life sucks!

02:25:20.557 --> 02:25:21.778
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate being a grown-up!

02:25:21.918 --> 02:25:22.438
[SPEAKER_02]: I hate it!

02:25:23.879 --> 02:25:26.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see what other people in our room have to say for the FUs of the week.

02:25:26.821 --> 02:25:29.043
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start it off with, uh, where are we gonna go?

02:25:29.103 --> 02:25:29.483
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42.

02:25:29.563 --> 02:25:38.029
[SPEAKER_26]: Uh, fuck you to my computer being old and slow, and can't really afford a new one right now.

02:25:38.669 --> 02:25:42.772
[SPEAKER_26]: Hopefully soon, but, you know, I put myself in more debt than I am right now.

02:25:43.948 --> 02:25:47.291
[SPEAKER_26]: Oh well, and fuck you to the next week because it's going to be slow at work.

02:25:47.811 --> 02:25:49.172
[SPEAKER_26]: I'll be bored half the time.

02:25:50.513 --> 02:25:52.314
[SPEAKER_26]: And, eh, I get it.

02:25:52.534 --> 02:25:53.095
[SPEAKER_26]: That's about it.

02:25:56.497 --> 02:25:57.018
[SPEAKER_02]: Ice Queen.

02:25:58.339 --> 02:25:59.159
[SPEAKER_22]: That's Princess Bitch.

02:26:00.320 --> 02:26:01.861
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever, you're the biggest queen of them all.

02:26:04.183 --> 02:26:04.683
[SPEAKER_25]: That's true.

02:26:06.705 --> 02:26:07.045
[SPEAKER_22]: I don't know.

02:26:08.126 --> 02:26:09.647
[SPEAKER_22]: Sorry, somebody... Give the FUs.

02:26:09.947 --> 02:26:11.068
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop screaming like a bitch.

02:26:11.989 --> 02:26:12.189
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay.

02:26:12.762 --> 02:26:20.007
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to Toyotas for being pieces of shit and trying to rip me off for 900 freaking dollars and having to take my fucking three weeks in a row.

02:26:20.467 --> 02:26:21.208
[SPEAKER_22]: Yeah, that too.

02:26:23.750 --> 02:26:24.390
[SPEAKER_22]: Well, I had to.

02:26:24.590 --> 02:26:27.152
[SPEAKER_22]: Anyway, so yeah, fuck you to that.

02:26:27.192 --> 02:26:35.358
[SPEAKER_22]: Fuck you to people who write up facts on how to get rid of viruses and tell you to do shit that's going to fuck up your computer because I'm still waiting on having mine completely fixed.

02:26:36.999 --> 02:26:40.221
[SPEAKER_22]: And fuck you to everybody who makes more money than me, which is just about everybody.

02:26:40.582 --> 02:26:41.462
[SPEAKER_22]: Okay, that's it.

02:26:42.023 --> 02:26:42.223
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel.

02:26:44.275 --> 02:26:47.557
[SPEAKER_19]: There are a few online classes because they're boring, but hey, whatever, I'm getting my shit done.

02:26:47.697 --> 02:26:54.341
[SPEAKER_19]: So, um, yeah, and work is, okay, but work is work.

02:26:54.701 --> 02:26:55.601
[SPEAKER_19]: Um, I will shut up now.

02:26:55.641 --> 02:26:56.042
[SPEAKER_19]: Bye-bye.

02:26:56.342 --> 02:26:57.642
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, BlankyStyle.

02:27:00.044 --> 02:27:10.049
[SPEAKER_29]: Uh, just, uh, fuck you to people who don't take care of your cars, and you post them online saying, oh, there's nothing wrong with it, I swear, and then you totally sound like a dipshit on the phone who doesn't know what the fuck you're talking about.

02:27:10.309 --> 02:27:12.691
[SPEAKER_29]: I guess that should be a big red flag and make me wonder, you know, why...

02:27:13.803 --> 02:27:14.764
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, okay.

02:27:14.804 --> 02:27:15.785
[SPEAKER_29]: Rob, you're...

02:27:41.272 --> 02:27:42.413
[SPEAKER_29]: You don't need to go there.

02:27:42.493 --> 02:27:42.793
[SPEAKER_19]: Really?

02:27:42.813 --> 02:27:45.274
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, remember when you got those tires a little while back?

02:27:45.414 --> 02:27:45.954
[SPEAKER_29]: Oh, shit.

02:27:45.994 --> 02:27:48.575
[SPEAKER_29]: Remember how good that car ran after you got new tires on it?

02:27:48.595 --> 02:27:51.016
[SPEAKER_29]: Maybe you should get some new ones now.

02:27:51.056 --> 02:27:51.876
[SPEAKER_29]: Or get them rotated.

02:27:52.557 --> 02:27:53.817
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to get your tires rotated?

02:27:53.837 --> 02:27:56.118
[SPEAKER_29]: You should rotate them after so many miles.

02:27:57.198 --> 02:28:00.320
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard once, like, I heard this rumor that some cars you have to put air in your tires.

02:28:00.380 --> 02:28:00.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that true?

02:28:01.929 --> 02:28:05.752
[SPEAKER_29]: Well, some of them actually have a totally solid center, like a cream fill.

02:28:06.293 --> 02:28:07.193
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, like a Twinkie.

02:28:07.234 --> 02:28:07.914
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, like a Twinkie.

02:28:07.974 --> 02:28:09.195
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think I have Twinkie tires.

02:28:09.235 --> 02:28:10.997
[SPEAKER_29]: Yeah, you won't need to fill those with air.

02:28:11.017 --> 02:28:14.319
[SPEAKER_29]: Gosh, people.

02:28:14.940 --> 02:28:15.881
[SPEAKER_02]: Mmm, Twinkie.

02:28:16.802 --> 02:28:21.606
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, Twinkie tires would be the best invention ever, at least if, you know, your tire pulls a flat.

02:28:21.946 --> 02:28:22.727
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, yeah!

02:28:22.827 --> 02:28:23.908
[SPEAKER_09]: Twinkie filling!

02:28:24.568 --> 02:28:26.250
[SPEAKER_09]: Woohoo!

02:28:26.390 --> 02:28:28.852
[SPEAKER_29]: Mmm, I'm full of Twinkie goodness.

02:28:28.872 --> 02:28:30.233
[SPEAKER_29]: Mmm, this is a delicious flat.

02:28:31.246 --> 02:28:40.468
[SPEAKER_29]: Now I just need to make a deep fryer big enough so I can fry them whenever I'm... It reminds me of that one Spamusement, which, by the way, is the best online comic of all time, Spamusement.

02:28:40.528 --> 02:28:42.049
[SPEAKER_29]: Just hang up, don't listen to the show anymore.

02:28:42.109 --> 02:28:44.029
[SPEAKER_02]: It says something about, are you man enough for this?

02:28:44.509 --> 02:28:47.150
[SPEAKER_29]: And then it's like a deep-fried truck.

02:28:47.170 --> 02:28:50.771
[SPEAKER_29]: What was it, like, I don't remember what it was, like, Dale Earnhardt Jr.

02:28:50.851 --> 02:28:55.932
[SPEAKER_29]: on a flatbed with a fishing pole, deep-fried with country gravy.

02:28:58.073 --> 02:28:59.533
[SPEAKER_29]: God, it was Spamusement.

02:29:00.356 --> 02:29:03.377
[SPEAKER_02]: S-P-A-M-U-S-C Spamusement.

02:29:03.537 --> 02:29:05.178
[SPEAKER_02]: Just take amusement and put SP on it.

02:29:05.778 --> 02:29:06.058
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright.

02:29:06.578 --> 02:29:07.458
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, moving on.

02:29:08.579 --> 02:29:10.919
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura, I have one more F you before we get to the chatroom F yous.

02:29:11.459 --> 02:29:15.041
[SPEAKER_20]: Just back to the other thing I was saying before.

02:29:16.061 --> 02:29:24.163
[SPEAKER_20]: For everybody who, and this actually goes a lot broader, for all of you people who bitch about the situation you're in, fucking make it change!

02:29:24.584 --> 02:29:29.285
[SPEAKER_20]: You know who just do nothing but complain about it when there are ways to make it better?

02:29:29.710 --> 02:29:37.093
[SPEAKER_20]: and then they don't do it because it's effort or it'll wreck the boat or stop bitching.

02:29:38.174 --> 02:29:39.595
[SPEAKER_20]: Take control of your fucking life.

02:29:40.575 --> 02:29:40.875
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm done.

02:29:42.376 --> 02:29:44.697
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually forgot one more F you myself.

02:29:45.217 --> 02:29:51.760
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to the fact that to go see The Lion King, it costs $75 to sit in the first tier.

02:29:52.100 --> 02:29:57.983
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in the first balcony, $75 seats, and for that price, you would expect that there would be some nudity.

02:29:58.860 --> 02:29:59.621
[SPEAKER_02]: and there was no nudity.

02:29:59.641 --> 02:30:00.463
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, nudity where?

02:30:00.723 --> 02:30:01.484
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Lion King.

02:30:02.145 --> 02:30:03.327
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's gonna be it.

02:30:04.389 --> 02:30:08.231
[SPEAKER_02]: Very upset at the lack of nudity in The Lion King, considering how much was paid to go see it.

02:30:08.291 --> 02:30:10.853
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless it was, uh, what's his name, uh, the guy that did Hairspray?

02:30:11.794 --> 02:30:13.374
[SPEAKER_30]: If you were to do The Lion King, yeah.

02:30:13.555 --> 02:30:18.578
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I realize that everybody brought their kids, and they were selling t-shirts that said Baby's First Musical and stuff.

02:30:18.998 --> 02:30:19.858
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted nudity!

02:30:19.999 --> 02:30:21.660
[SPEAKER_22]: Were you hoping for Simba's shaved balls?

02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:23.621
[SPEAKER_02]: If nothing else.

02:30:24.341 --> 02:30:26.903
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, or Mufasa and whatever.

02:30:27.023 --> 02:30:29.304
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to see Mufasa's Mufasa!

02:30:29.344 --> 02:30:32.226
[SPEAKER_02]: Mufasa's like, it's time to make a baby.

02:30:33.343 --> 02:30:34.244
[SPEAKER_02]: Roar!

02:30:34.764 --> 02:30:35.344
[SPEAKER_13]: Roar!

02:30:35.444 --> 02:30:37.466
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, Ice Queen, yeah, one last FU.

02:30:39.267 --> 02:30:40.007
[SPEAKER_02]: No, yes, no.

02:30:41.668 --> 02:30:47.011
[SPEAKER_22]: My last FU was to Effort, because I heard Jamie's FUs, and fuck Effort, screw that.

02:30:47.111 --> 02:30:50.413
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to live and be rich and not have to move a freaking muscle.

02:30:50.833 --> 02:30:53.715
[SPEAKER_22]: I want to win the lottery and be just a complete leech off society.

02:30:53.735 --> 02:30:55.216
[SPEAKER_20]: You could be like that lady in Florida.

02:30:55.236 --> 02:30:55.916
[SPEAKER_22]: That is my dream.

02:30:56.577 --> 02:30:57.597
[SPEAKER_20]: But see, there's a difference.

02:30:58.178 --> 02:30:59.399
[SPEAKER_20]: You're not complaining about it.

02:30:59.459 --> 02:31:01.700
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm talking about to the people who say, I live...

02:31:02.299 --> 02:31:03.620
[SPEAKER_22]: I was just not complaining.

02:31:03.640 --> 02:31:07.283
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't call you at 9 o'clock at night.

02:31:08.324 --> 02:31:09.565
[SPEAKER_30]: My life sucks.

02:31:09.665 --> 02:31:10.406
[SPEAKER_30]: What did you do today?

02:31:11.407 --> 02:31:11.867
[SPEAKER_30]: Nothing.

02:31:11.907 --> 02:31:13.189
[SPEAKER_30]: I thought about paying a bill.

02:31:14.690 --> 02:31:21.856
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm just talking about all the people who live with their parents and say, Oh, my parents don't respect me.

02:31:22.256 --> 02:31:24.098
[SPEAKER_20]: And they make me do this.

02:31:24.258 --> 02:31:24.618
[SPEAKER_18]: And they're 30.

02:31:26.115 --> 02:31:30.039
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents bought me the old model SUV because they don't love me.

02:31:30.099 --> 02:31:33.723
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents want me to stop whoring out and go back to junior high.

02:31:35.044 --> 02:31:38.708
[SPEAKER_20]: My mommy yells at me, but I'm going to go out and buy an iPod.

02:31:40.390 --> 02:31:41.832
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go to the chatroom, FU, shall we?

02:31:43.033 --> 02:31:44.454
[SPEAKER_02]: Started off with Miklatov.

02:31:44.695 --> 02:31:48.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Miklatov says, FU to not welcoming a cute boy's advances because I suck.

02:31:49.861 --> 02:31:50.861
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to being sick all week.

02:31:51.041 --> 02:31:52.962
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to E3 being too far away.

02:31:53.062 --> 02:31:54.462
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to general boredom.

02:31:54.782 --> 02:31:58.863
[SPEAKER_22]: Miklatov, if you were here, I would not be shunning your advances, so you don't have to worry about that.

02:31:59.363 --> 02:32:00.243
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, how nice are you.

02:32:01.183 --> 02:32:03.904
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion says F you to a boring weekend.

02:32:03.944 --> 02:32:04.424
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

02:32:04.524 --> 02:32:05.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Not angsty this week.

02:32:05.644 --> 02:32:09.945
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and F you to About Schmidt for horribly depressing me by saying how significant life is.

02:32:10.965 --> 02:32:13.186
[SPEAKER_02]: And F you to the Live365 Awards.

02:32:13.526 --> 02:32:15.346
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys were O-L robbed.

02:32:16.367 --> 02:32:16.647
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

02:32:16.807 --> 02:32:17.307
[SPEAKER_02]: O-L-R.

02:32:17.467 --> 02:32:17.967
[SPEAKER_02]: O-L robbed.

02:32:18.107 --> 02:32:18.327
[SPEAKER_02]: Get it?

02:32:22.299 --> 02:32:46.968
[SPEAKER_02]: Zaku says, F you to the drunk tards in another apartment in my apartment complex who thought that the place needed a more loud cowbell last night F you to having to work off the books to make a living and F you to having to put off finding a summer job till after finals when there probably won't be any good jobs left Jaded2005 says, F you to this guy who keeps calling me and waking me up

02:32:49.198 --> 02:32:56.780
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkLionXVI says, F you to Spring Valley High School for suspending my cousin and his friend just because they were victims of a gang fight.

02:32:57.460 --> 02:33:05.982
[SPEAKER_02]: My cousin's the one who got hit in the head with a hammer and his friend saved his life, yet they were suspended and were about to face expulsion.

02:33:06.322 --> 02:33:09.203
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all over the local news and I hope they're embarrassed about it.

02:33:09.943 --> 02:33:11.203
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they trying to reenact, like,

02:33:11.710 --> 02:33:13.552
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind, I don't want to go there.

02:33:14.192 --> 02:33:19.636
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to WYN Las Vegas for being the most disappointing opening on the strip.

02:33:20.037 --> 02:33:22.699
[SPEAKER_02]: Too many flowers on the inside and it's almost like the Bellagio.

02:33:22.739 --> 02:33:24.881
[SPEAKER_02]: The only good thing about that place is the damn poker room.

02:33:25.701 --> 02:33:30.505
[SPEAKER_02]: F you to KVVU Fox 5 Las Vegas for misspelling my cousin's last name.

02:33:32.507 --> 02:33:37.751
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkTetsuya says, F you to whatever was causing my loss of appetite about a week and a half ago.

02:33:39.453 --> 02:33:41.054
[SPEAKER_02]: That would probably be Roseanne Naked.

02:33:43.366 --> 02:33:43.867
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.

02:33:44.507 --> 02:33:46.707
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are kind of not angsty tonight.

02:33:47.628 --> 02:33:49.048
[SPEAKER_20]: I thought I was plenty angsty.

02:33:49.248 --> 02:33:53.109
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, you guys are plenty angsty, but I mean like the chat room.

02:33:53.429 --> 02:33:55.129
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't vote and they weren't angsty.

02:33:55.149 --> 02:33:55.870
[SPEAKER_02]: What's wrong with you guys?

02:33:57.130 --> 02:33:59.731
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're background noise for a lot of people tonight.

02:34:00.091 --> 02:34:01.771
[SPEAKER_20]: They're watching Family Guy.

02:34:02.931 --> 02:34:03.252
[SPEAKER_20]: Damn them.

02:34:03.272 --> 02:34:04.212
[SPEAKER_02]: We should just spoil it.

02:34:04.572 --> 02:34:05.712
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we better not do that.

02:34:05.752 --> 02:34:06.712
[SPEAKER_20]: Everybody dies.

02:34:06.752 --> 02:34:07.633
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody dies.

02:34:07.833 --> 02:34:08.453
[SPEAKER_02]: The boat sinks.

02:34:08.693 --> 02:34:08.933
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.

02:34:11.107 --> 02:34:12.907
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter and... Stewie's gay.

02:34:16.948 --> 02:34:18.149
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter and Lois have sex.

02:34:18.669 --> 02:34:19.369
[SPEAKER_02]: Multiple times.

02:34:21.209 --> 02:34:22.550
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, we're going to go to a quick break.

02:34:22.570 --> 02:34:26.271
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we're going to come back and do some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:34:26.411 --> 02:34:30.052
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's been a little while since we've given you guys an opportunity to ask us questions.

02:34:30.472 --> 02:34:32.172
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been gone a couple weeks and we're back.

02:34:32.572 --> 02:34:34.433
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to Ask Orange Lounge.

02:34:34.453 --> 02:34:38.034
[SPEAKER_02]: So send a private message to Sky in the chat room with any questions that you may have.

02:34:38.654 --> 02:34:39.274
[SPEAKER_02]: In this break...

[SPEAKER_13]: The Orange Lounge Radio With the Ping Pong Ball

02:43:11.004 --> 02:43:15.586
[SPEAKER_02]: We are back here on Orange Lounge Radio, and as promised, we're going to get into a little bit of Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:15.606 --> 02:43:22.010
[SPEAKER_02]: This is where you guys get to direct the future of the show by asking us questions about what you would like to hear us talk about.

02:43:22.430 --> 02:43:23.851
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we're interactive like that.

02:43:24.191 --> 02:43:27.133
[SPEAKER_02]: So, here we go with some Ask Orange Lounge.

02:43:34.236 --> 02:43:37.218
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's ask Orange Lounge some stupid questions.

02:43:37.711 --> 02:43:40.892
[SPEAKER_02]: What will we find out this week on Orange Lounge Radio?

02:43:41.392 --> 02:43:48.394
[SPEAKER_02]: It would be nice if I could concentrate, but the people in the kitchen are making so much goddamn noise that I can't think straight.

02:43:53.956 --> 02:43:55.396
[SPEAKER_02]: Song number one.

02:43:55.456 --> 02:43:56.536
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I can't think straight today.

02:43:57.577 --> 02:43:59.577
[SPEAKER_02]: Jaded2005 with question number one.

02:44:00.057 --> 02:44:03.558
[SPEAKER_02]: Me and my girlfriend have never seen you guys' faces.

02:44:03.778 --> 02:44:05.499
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys look like?

02:44:09.517 --> 02:44:11.638
[SPEAKER_02]: Folks from the kitchen saying they look like whores.

02:44:11.759 --> 02:44:14.280
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the question wasn't about the folks in the kitchen, it's about us in here.

02:44:14.601 --> 02:44:15.441
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we look like?

02:44:17.162 --> 02:44:18.463
[SPEAKER_20]: We're damn sexy!

02:44:18.483 --> 02:44:23.567
[SPEAKER_02]: There's pictures of us online?

02:44:23.667 --> 02:44:36.916
[SPEAKER_02]: I look like Tom Cruise, and Matt looks like Matt Damon, and DarkSakura looks like Angelina Jolie, just like her.

02:44:39.372 --> 02:44:41.693
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just, I'm making stuff up so that they, you know, can fantasize.

02:44:41.713 --> 02:44:47.216
[SPEAKER_20]: Well, at least she doesn't look like a freaking toothpick, like Nicole Kidman's turned herself into, anorexic.

02:44:48.456 --> 02:44:55.239
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, actually, if you guys want to see our pictures, we do have a picture gallery, if you're a registered user of OrangeOnTrader.com, and we don't spam you, there's no reason not to sign up.

02:44:55.599 --> 02:44:59.581
[SPEAKER_02]: Just head on over, and you'll see the picture galleries, and you can actually see pictures of us at E3.

02:44:59.921 --> 02:45:02.562
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like plenty of pictures there, uh, from last year's E3.

02:45:02.743 --> 02:45:08.045
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Jamie, who's typically camera shy, can be seen in those pictures, if you know where to look.

02:45:09.204 --> 02:45:11.346
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, question number two from Illusion.

02:45:11.846 --> 02:45:14.829
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion would like to know, and perhaps Jamie you can answer this one for Illusion.

02:45:15.289 --> 02:45:18.172
[SPEAKER_02]: Illusion would like to know, why do women have breasts?

02:45:20.134 --> 02:45:23.497
[SPEAKER_20]: Genetically to provide sustenance for the child.

02:45:25.618 --> 02:45:27.961
[SPEAKER_02]: And to bring home a paycheck at the end of the day.

02:45:29.862 --> 02:45:30.343
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop.

02:45:31.444 --> 02:45:33.305
[SPEAKER_02]: It's for feeding babies.

02:45:34.006 --> 02:45:34.987
[SPEAKER_20]: It is for feeding babies.

02:45:36.610 --> 02:45:39.051
[SPEAKER_30]: and old four year old men who pay enough.

02:45:41.591 --> 02:45:42.271
[SPEAKER_19]: Just shut up.

02:45:47.612 --> 02:45:51.553
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes kittens because I saw that once on a Japanese TV show.

02:45:53.854 --> 02:45:54.154
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:45:55.534 --> 02:45:56.114
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on.

02:45:57.354 --> 02:45:58.955
[SPEAKER_20]: Yeah, they do say breast milk is best.

02:45:59.155 --> 02:46:00.955
[SPEAKER_02]: Only on this show would somebody ask that question.

02:46:01.015 --> 02:46:02.195
[SPEAKER_20]: Why do women have boobies?

02:46:03.876 --> 02:46:04.556
[SPEAKER_02]: Ask your mama.

02:46:04.596 --> 02:46:05.636
[SPEAKER_02]: Dear Orange Lounge,

02:46:06.314 --> 02:46:07.035
[SPEAKER_02]: What's sex?

02:46:08.377 --> 02:46:09.698
[SPEAKER_08]: Why do I have a pee-pee?

02:46:12.662 --> 02:46:17.528
[SPEAKER_02]: Mikotov would like to know, what are you most looking forward to at E3 this year?

02:46:19.972 --> 02:46:20.392
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, Loki.

02:46:21.193 --> 02:46:21.654
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping.

02:46:24.118 --> 02:46:25.238
[SPEAKER_02]: You're just going to sleep through E3?

02:46:25.278 --> 02:46:26.659
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the plan?

02:46:26.679 --> 02:46:30.041
[SPEAKER_02]: Sleeping after walking around during E3.

02:46:30.121 --> 02:46:30.661
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I see.

02:46:30.861 --> 02:46:32.202
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, you get tired.

02:46:32.662 --> 02:46:37.164
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but what I want to see, I want to see Sinbad being ignored again.

02:46:39.505 --> 02:46:41.446
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell the Sinbad story for those new listeners.

02:46:42.227 --> 02:46:46.049
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw Sinbad at E3 last year, and he waved, and no one cared.

02:46:46.069 --> 02:46:48.370
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone was just like, Who's that guy?

02:46:48.410 --> 02:46:49.070
[SPEAKER_02]: Who's that guy?

02:46:49.410 --> 02:46:49.991
[SPEAKER_02]: It's Sinbad.

02:46:50.531 --> 02:46:50.611
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

02:46:52.265 --> 02:46:52.986
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor guy.

02:46:53.887 --> 02:46:55.989
[SPEAKER_02]: Say, look at me!

02:46:56.510 --> 02:46:57.531
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi!

02:46:57.551 --> 02:46:58.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi?

02:46:58.612 --> 02:46:58.652
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi?

02:47:01.615 --> 02:47:04.138
[SPEAKER_02]: Poor Sinbad.

02:47:04.178 --> 02:47:10.065
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm most looking forward to at E3 this year is the fact that there's going to be DDR with Mario.

02:47:10.285 --> 02:47:12.087
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be a fun game to check out.

02:47:12.563 --> 02:47:17.530
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm also looking forward to seeing what Nintendo turns out with the new Zelda and possibly a new console.

02:47:17.591 --> 02:47:18.111
[SPEAKER_02]: Possibly.

02:47:18.532 --> 02:47:22.518
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm looking forward to actually seeing progress on the Nintendo DS.

02:47:22.818 --> 02:47:23.679
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking forward to that as well.

02:47:24.941 --> 02:47:25.382
[SPEAKER_02]: DarkSakura.

02:47:25.662 --> 02:47:27.445
[SPEAKER_20]: I'm looking forward to ogling over the Marines.

02:47:28.851 --> 02:47:30.732
[SPEAKER_20]: There will be lots of men in uniform.

02:47:31.772 --> 02:47:42.675
[SPEAKER_02]: I am expecting, I'm hoping this year with metrosexuality pushing more and more, as much as that word is stupid, pushing more and more into our culture, I'm looking for booth boys this year instead of booth babes.

02:47:42.715 --> 02:47:43.776
[SPEAKER_02]: I want some booth boys this year.

02:47:45.196 --> 02:47:46.456
[SPEAKER_02]: When I say boys, 18 and over, please.

02:47:46.476 --> 02:47:49.577
[SPEAKER_02]: With the general demographic of being Nuri...

02:47:52.858 --> 02:47:56.939
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, late 20s... That's starting to be more and more bullshit, though.

02:47:57.079 --> 02:47:59.939
[SPEAKER_02]: Women are starting to play games more and more and more and more and more.

02:48:00.200 --> 02:48:01.740
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's been a long time coming.

02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:02.340
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.

02:48:02.720 --> 02:48:03.860
[SPEAKER_02]: Next thing you know, they'll want to vote.

02:48:04.260 --> 02:48:09.721
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, honestly... This is your cue to tear into them.

02:48:12.262 --> 02:48:12.802
[SPEAKER_20]: Repeat, please.

02:48:14.322 --> 02:48:15.782
[SPEAKER_20]: I tend to ignore what he says.

02:48:15.882 --> 02:48:16.982
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, allow me to repeat.

02:48:17.223 --> 02:48:19.763
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, next thing you know, they'll want to vote.

02:48:22.373 --> 02:48:23.974
[SPEAKER_02]: The ferrets haven't been unpacked yet, sorry.

02:48:25.954 --> 02:48:35.196
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, in fact, actually, while you're at it, while you're at it, Illusion had the answer to his question from earlier, why do women have breasts?

02:48:35.236 --> 02:48:40.658
[SPEAKER_02]: He sent another message that says, the correct answer was, so you got something to look at when you're talking to them.

02:48:45.639 --> 02:48:46.299
[SPEAKER_18]: Where's the webcam?

02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:48.540
[SPEAKER_02]: The webcam's over there, but it's very dark.

02:48:50.128 --> 02:48:52.210
[SPEAKER_18]: I'm up here, not down there, now go away.

02:48:54.151 --> 02:48:55.892
[SPEAKER_18]: That's it, mastectomy.

02:48:58.193 --> 02:49:02.596
[SPEAKER_02]: And some women aren't just not up here and not down there, they're down a little bit lower.

02:49:03.956 --> 02:49:04.337
[SPEAKER_02]: Like grandma?

02:49:04.357 --> 02:49:05.377
[SPEAKER_20]: Those are people in their 60s.

02:49:07.419 --> 02:49:07.799
[SPEAKER_02]: Saggy.

02:49:07.939 --> 02:49:08.999
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't look at grandma's breasts.

02:49:09.019 --> 02:49:11.041
[SPEAKER_20]: That is the result of bra burning in the 70s.

02:49:13.280 --> 02:49:14.741
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, yeah.

02:49:14.781 --> 02:49:16.082
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the point of that?

02:49:16.423 --> 02:49:17.023
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, honestly.

02:49:17.043 --> 02:49:19.425
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not going to be considered by bras.

02:49:20.706 --> 02:49:21.687
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yay.

02:49:22.308 --> 02:49:28.193
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they saw that as a symbol of, you know, men keeping their fit on women.

02:49:28.213 --> 02:49:32.576
[SPEAKER_20]: But the whole thing, bras are there to support your boobs so you're not saggy.

02:49:33.077 --> 02:49:34.818
[SPEAKER_02]: I know some men that like to wear bras.

02:49:35.379 --> 02:49:36.099
[SPEAKER_20]: They're like, they're like.

02:49:36.119 --> 02:49:37.761
[SPEAKER_20]: Because they got tits.

02:49:39.389 --> 02:49:40.611
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't hold us back!

02:49:40.711 --> 02:49:42.273
[SPEAKER_02]: Now spray us with that hose!

02:49:42.494 --> 02:49:42.614
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh.

02:49:46.620 --> 02:49:47.081
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways.

02:49:47.722 --> 02:49:50.326
[SPEAKER_02]: I gotta play the sexist role on this show.

02:49:50.346 --> 02:49:50.446
[SPEAKER_02]: It's

02:49:52.486 --> 02:49:56.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, right, all right, the role, the role that you fit into.

02:49:56.267 --> 02:50:10.131
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, honestly, I've been talking to, you know, my fiancée, and she says that women are not bad drivers, but every time I see a goddamn, you know, crazy bitch on the road, it's always some stupid woman on her cell phone driving an SUV.

02:50:10.512 --> 02:50:13.072
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help it if they keep perpetuating the stereotype.

02:50:13.672 --> 02:50:15.113
[SPEAKER_20]: I got stuck behind...

02:50:15.934 --> 02:50:18.938
[SPEAKER_20]: An old man driving an SUV talking on his cell phone.

02:50:18.978 --> 02:50:19.438
[SPEAKER_20]: Exactly.

02:50:19.678 --> 02:50:21.701
[SPEAKER_20]: They fall into the old people category.

02:50:21.941 --> 02:50:23.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Was he burning his bra?

02:50:23.323 --> 02:50:25.685
[SPEAKER_20]: He was burning his pampers.

02:50:25.705 --> 02:50:26.927
[SPEAKER_20]: I don't know.

02:50:27.267 --> 02:50:29.089
[SPEAKER_20]: Whatever it is the old men wear depends.

02:50:30.791 --> 02:50:31.592
[SPEAKER_02]: Old men are nasty.

02:50:33.063 --> 02:50:39.145
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, my new roommate is looking in on the room right now, kind of going, what the hell are these people doing right now?

02:50:39.765 --> 02:50:40.685
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we interview you, please?

02:50:41.105 --> 02:50:44.066
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't you agree women suck at driving?

02:50:45.586 --> 02:50:46.427
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my new roommate.

02:50:46.447 --> 02:50:46.787
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hello.

02:50:46.927 --> 02:50:47.627
[SPEAKER_21]: Hello.

02:50:47.927 --> 02:50:50.828
[SPEAKER_02]: How much DDR do you play?

02:50:50.868 --> 02:50:51.888
[SPEAKER_02]: How familiar are you with DDR?

02:50:52.686 --> 02:50:56.669
[SPEAKER_21]: Um, well, I just, like, played the game that my sister bought.

02:50:57.130 --> 02:51:01.253
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is DDR Extreme on PS2.

02:51:01.433 --> 02:51:02.033
[SPEAKER_21]: And it was fun.

02:51:02.994 --> 02:51:06.317
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think about the fact that your roommate does this crazy internet radio program?

02:51:06.777 --> 02:51:12.341
[SPEAKER_21]: It's craziness with a capital K. Um, no, I think it's cool.

02:51:13.482 --> 02:51:15.483
[SPEAKER_21]: This is the first time I've seen you do it, so it's cool.

02:51:15.704 --> 02:51:16.684
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we nerds or what?

02:51:17.325 --> 02:51:17.365
[SPEAKER_21]: Um...

02:51:17.873 --> 02:51:18.874
[SPEAKER_21]: You're a crazy nerd.

02:51:18.914 --> 02:51:22.456
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that you're entertaining the guests out in the kitchen who have long since abandoned the show.

02:51:23.096 --> 02:51:23.897
[SPEAKER_21]: That's cool, yeah.

02:51:23.937 --> 02:51:24.877
[SPEAKER_02]: Now tell them to keep it down out there.

02:51:24.897 --> 02:51:25.698
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to do a show in here.

02:51:25.898 --> 02:51:26.538
[SPEAKER_21]: Keep it down.

02:51:26.658 --> 02:51:28.319
[SPEAKER_21]: Oh, okay, I'll go that way.

02:51:28.699 --> 02:51:28.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa.

02:51:29.540 --> 02:51:30.320
[SPEAKER_02]: What the hell was that noise?

02:51:31.521 --> 02:51:31.881
[SPEAKER_02]: That was weird.

02:51:31.921 --> 02:51:32.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, sorry.

02:51:32.702 --> 02:51:33.482
[SPEAKER_02]: It must be interference.

02:51:34.603 --> 02:51:35.163
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, okay.

02:51:36.064 --> 02:51:36.384
[SPEAKER_21]: Okay.

02:51:36.564 --> 02:51:37.064
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, well.

02:51:37.304 --> 02:51:38.465
[SPEAKER_21]: All right, well, nice seeing you.

02:51:38.485 --> 02:51:38.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.

02:51:39.386 --> 02:51:40.767
[SPEAKER_02]: Get out of the room that you pay rent for.

02:51:40.787 --> 02:51:41.367
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm just kidding.

02:51:42.347 --> 02:51:43.088
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but honestly.

02:51:45.051 --> 02:51:50.112
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like I said, there are the slight few, just like good Comcast cable, you know.

02:51:50.372 --> 02:51:51.172
[SPEAKER_20]: I drive well.

02:51:51.712 --> 02:51:52.852
[SPEAKER_20]: I said the slight few.

02:51:53.052 --> 02:51:56.113
[SPEAKER_20]: People don't pull out in front of me in their taxi van.

02:51:56.273 --> 02:51:56.993
[SPEAKER_19]: Exactly.

02:51:57.213 --> 02:51:58.233
[SPEAKER_20]: I beeped at this guy.

02:51:58.553 --> 02:52:05.475
[SPEAKER_20]: I was like, beep, beep, and I ended up having to swerve into the other lane, and then I slid because of the freaking, you know, rain.

02:52:05.575 --> 02:52:07.675
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, everyone knows that taxi drivers suck.

02:52:07.695 --> 02:52:08.915
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually wanted to do that.

02:52:08.975 --> 02:52:13.156
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of actually honking my horn, rolling down the window, and sticking my head out and yelling, beep, beep.

02:52:13.616 --> 02:52:15.237
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I think people would notice me more then.

02:52:15.437 --> 02:52:17.999
[SPEAKER_02]: As you hit something and your head gets taken off.

02:52:18.259 --> 02:52:19.640
[SPEAKER_08]: Hey, you sucker!

02:52:20.060 --> 02:52:21.541
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm about to run into your ass!

02:52:21.602 --> 02:52:23.703
[SPEAKER_08]: Extend your left arm out.

02:52:24.604 --> 02:52:26.365
[SPEAKER_08]: Extend your middle finger up.

02:52:29.527 --> 02:52:32.069
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyways, we totally sidestepped whatever that question was.

02:52:32.269 --> 02:52:34.130
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm going to post pictures of my car in the chatroom.

02:52:34.410 --> 02:52:35.351
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninst has a question.

02:52:36.351 --> 02:52:38.393
[SPEAKER_02]: Ninst says he's kind of stretching for a question here.

02:52:38.453 --> 02:52:39.534
[SPEAKER_02]: Skip it if you've got a better one.

02:52:39.574 --> 02:52:40.034
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we don't.

02:52:41.011 --> 02:52:45.537
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be getting another 2DX game soon, so 7th style or 8th style?

02:52:47.140 --> 02:52:47.220
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

02:52:47.240 --> 02:52:49.122
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

02:52:49.262 --> 02:52:49.863
[SPEAKER_02]: I say 7th.

02:52:51.265 --> 02:52:57.654
[SPEAKER_19]: That's actually a toss-up because I like what's on 7th, but I really like what's on 8th, so... Get 6th.

02:52:57.674 --> 02:52:57.734
[SPEAKER_02]: 8th.

02:53:00.478 --> 02:53:01.098
[SPEAKER_02]: I like Seventh.

02:53:01.278 --> 02:53:02.519
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to be the lone hold-up for Seventh.

02:53:02.539 --> 02:53:05.740
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, honestly, in Eighth Style, you get a lot of the good Seventh Style songs.

02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:10.722
[SPEAKER_02]: But, but, but, but, Beauty of Silence, Sound of Goodbye, but, but, but, you know, that's just me.

02:53:12.462 --> 02:53:13.322
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't play 2DX.

02:53:15.743 --> 02:53:18.384
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, a question, because we didn't get any more than this.

02:53:18.444 --> 02:53:19.705
[SPEAKER_02]: Legend of Zaku has this.

02:53:19.765 --> 02:53:20.665
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is beautiful.

02:53:21.305 --> 02:53:28.748
[SPEAKER_02]: After stumbling through the Errand in Japan forums, I managed to find a thread that has what appears to be a link for a DDR movie in production.

02:53:30.111 --> 02:53:33.453
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the link of the story since the main site is down and then he gave a link here.

02:53:33.893 --> 02:53:36.375
[SPEAKER_02]: What chances do you give this so-called movie in the works?

02:53:36.415 --> 02:53:38.036
[SPEAKER_02]: So I looked at the link he gave and here it is.

02:53:39.037 --> 02:53:43.419
[SPEAKER_02]: Dance Dance Revolution is the name of the popular video game created by the well-known game company Konami.

02:53:43.840 --> 02:53:47.622
[SPEAKER_02]: The current team consists... Okay, right there, you know it's a fake.

02:53:48.262 --> 02:53:48.883
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell, right?

02:53:48.923 --> 02:53:50.844
[SPEAKER_02]: What is wrong with the first sentence that makes this a fake?

02:53:52.545 --> 02:53:52.965
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami.

02:53:54.146 --> 02:53:54.866
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not Konami.

02:53:54.886 --> 02:53:55.207
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:53:55.747 --> 02:53:55.867
[SPEAKER_02]: What?

02:53:56.855 --> 02:53:58.517
[SPEAKER_02]: It says, well-known game company, Konami.

02:53:58.797 --> 02:54:00.378
[SPEAKER_02]: Konami does much more than just video games.

02:54:00.819 --> 02:54:01.920
[SPEAKER_02]: Much, much more than just video games.

02:54:02.300 --> 02:54:02.600
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember?

02:54:02.760 --> 02:54:03.841
[SPEAKER_02]: They create slot machines.

02:54:04.061 --> 02:54:06.644
[SPEAKER_20]: Oh, yeah, but primarily they're known for the video games.

02:54:06.664 --> 02:54:09.246
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm saying, if this were an official press release, that wouldn't say that.

02:54:09.847 --> 02:54:10.267
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think.

02:54:10.647 --> 02:54:12.049
[SPEAKER_02]: It would say something like game publishers.

02:54:12.249 --> 02:54:13.590
[SPEAKER_02]: Either that or these people are just stupid.

02:54:14.070 --> 02:54:17.774
[SPEAKER_02]: The current team consists of two members so far, and I'm not even going to read their names.

02:54:18.334 --> 02:54:19.275
[SPEAKER_02]: Creator and directors.

02:54:19.355 --> 02:54:20.236
[SPEAKER_02]: Two guys I've never heard of.

02:54:20.816 --> 02:54:22.978
[SPEAKER_02]: We started Dance Dance Revolution the movie in 2005.

02:54:24.858 --> 02:54:26.580
[SPEAKER_02]: Alrighty then, time for the storyline.

02:54:26.600 --> 02:54:30.683
[SPEAKER_02]: 18-year-old Emi Toshiba's lifelong dream was to become a professional dancer.

02:54:31.264 --> 02:54:34.527
[SPEAKER_02]: One day, she sees a flyer on a liquor store's window announcing a dance contest.

02:54:34.627 --> 02:54:39.251
[SPEAKER_02]: As she runs for the big-time winner with her partner, Rage, they meet some new friends, rivals, and conflicts.

02:54:39.411 --> 02:54:45.916
[SPEAKER_02]: As Emi is settling into her new surroundings, she and her new friends gradually become aware that not all is quite right in the contest.

02:54:46.217 --> 02:54:49.760
[SPEAKER_02]: Something sinister is lurking deep in the shadows of the dancing stage.

02:54:50.575 --> 02:54:53.496
[SPEAKER_02]: The movie is all about competition, love, and accepting others as they are.

02:54:53.536 --> 02:54:56.097
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you like drama, comedy, and DDR, this is the movie for you!

02:54:57.237 --> 02:55:03.019
[SPEAKER_02]: The plans, we're going to produce the movie in 2007 or 2008, depending on when we'll get enough money for the production.

02:55:03.479 --> 02:55:05.819
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on when we graduate from college.

02:55:07.620 --> 02:55:08.640
[SPEAKER_20]: You know what, it's not going to happen.

02:55:08.660 --> 02:55:10.801
[SPEAKER_20]: That's like a plot of maybe an anime for it.

02:55:12.719 --> 02:55:15.299
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like Emmy of Rage Liquor Store.

02:55:15.860 --> 02:55:16.740
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh my god!

02:55:17.060 --> 02:55:18.360
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to be dancer!

02:55:18.580 --> 02:55:23.821
[SPEAKER_02]: Emmy, by the way, is going to be played by a big-breasted Asian chick in order to sell tickets.

02:55:23.881 --> 02:55:24.381
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll watch it.

02:55:26.141 --> 02:55:28.102
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I don't care what it's about.

02:55:28.162 --> 02:55:35.283
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just get that chick from BMX XXX, the one that strips down naked and is dressed up like a schoolgirl.

02:55:35.763 --> 02:55:37.163
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll get me to see that movie.

02:55:37.743 --> 02:55:41.284
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you need to show is her dressed up like a schoolgirl stripping down naked.

02:55:42.469 --> 02:55:44.933
[SPEAKER_02]: In the trailer, that will sell tickets.

02:55:45.594 --> 02:55:47.857
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell, they should just make BMX XXX the movie.

02:55:48.057 --> 02:55:48.638
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be better.

02:55:50.320 --> 02:55:53.484
[SPEAKER_02]: Every six months, the topic of DDR the movie is coming up.

02:55:54.906 --> 02:55:56.589
[SPEAKER_02]: Stop believing it!

02:55:57.370 --> 02:55:58.951
[SPEAKER_02]: There's only one way this will happen.

02:55:59.051 --> 02:56:09.896
[SPEAKER_02]: Until it is posted on IMDB or announced by a reputable has a reputation, right?

02:56:10.357 --> 02:56:12.678
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the big five movie production companies.

02:56:12.698 --> 02:56:13.558
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who's going to do this?

02:56:13.598 --> 02:56:16.060
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if it's Lionsgate, wait for them to announce it.

02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:16.800
[SPEAKER_02]: You know who's going to?

02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:18.341
[SPEAKER_02]: Now Lionsgate's not all bad.

02:56:18.361 --> 02:56:18.961
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, I know.

02:56:18.981 --> 02:56:19.801
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't be knocking Lionsgate.

02:56:19.821 --> 02:56:20.862
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to knock Lionsgate.

02:56:20.882 --> 02:56:32.087
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just going to say, you know who would stoop this low, Uyval?

02:56:32.507 --> 02:56:38.290
[SPEAKER_02]: He would do this because he's like, ooh, an excuse to have another rave on an island.

02:56:41.308 --> 02:56:41.328
[SPEAKER_19]: 10K...

02:56:52.956 --> 02:56:55.357
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, God, don't start on that again.

02:56:55.397 --> 02:56:56.997
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another fanboy thing, though.

02:56:57.037 --> 02:57:00.178
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, with all due respect to the folks that created it, come on.

02:57:00.358 --> 02:57:01.178
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's the thing, though.

02:57:01.658 --> 02:57:02.938
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way that it would work.

02:57:03.458 --> 02:57:06.159
[SPEAKER_02]: And the whole focus of it's not really on DDR.

02:57:06.179 --> 02:57:09.760
[SPEAKER_02]: They play DDR in it, but that's not really the focus of it.

02:57:10.120 --> 02:57:12.740
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like the setup that they do for the tournament.

02:57:12.760 --> 02:57:14.361
[SPEAKER_02]: The tournament setup was kind of cool.

02:57:14.781 --> 02:57:15.961
[SPEAKER_02]: It made it look cool.

02:57:16.141 --> 02:57:18.062
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only way that it would work.

02:57:18.582 --> 02:57:19.262
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this, like...

02:57:19.858 --> 02:57:20.679
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloodsport DDR Edition

02:57:46.624 --> 02:57:49.385
[SPEAKER_02]: I think now would be a good time to end Ask Orange Lounge.

02:57:49.405 --> 02:57:50.085
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you guys think?

02:57:51.145 --> 02:57:52.186
[SPEAKER_02]: I think not.

02:57:53.426 --> 02:57:56.207
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, I'm being linked to something in the chatroom.

02:57:56.247 --> 02:57:58.268
[SPEAKER_02]: It is something that's on Internet Movie Database.

02:57:59.448 --> 02:58:01.289
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, I think this is what I think it is.

02:58:01.889 --> 02:58:03.189
[SPEAKER_02]: Hold on, I'm trying to load the link right now.

02:58:03.770 --> 02:58:05.050
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the chatroom.

02:58:05.070 --> 02:58:06.911
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Dance Dance Documentary.

02:58:09.291 --> 02:58:09.651
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.

02:58:09.691 --> 02:58:13.073
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that folks... What is this?

02:58:13.553 --> 02:58:14.213
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a DVD...

02:58:15.947 --> 02:58:16.848
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a documentary.

02:58:18.689 --> 02:58:19.329
[SPEAKER_02]: Eh, big deal.

02:58:19.550 --> 02:58:20.250
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no offense.

02:58:20.710 --> 02:58:21.911
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I was in one of these.

02:58:22.091 --> 02:58:23.392
[SPEAKER_02]: I got interviewed for one of these.

02:58:23.412 --> 02:58:27.976
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted me to wear the Dr. Dick hat, the orange hat, and I wouldn't do it because I knew it was being made for a movie.

02:58:28.696 --> 02:58:31.698
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that's the one or if it was some other college project or something.

02:58:31.718 --> 02:58:33.079
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a college project.

02:58:33.100 --> 02:58:33.620
[SPEAKER_25]: I don't know.

02:58:35.171 --> 02:58:36.352
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't the same thing.

02:58:36.432 --> 02:58:37.833
[SPEAKER_02]: Documentaries are one thing.

02:58:37.893 --> 02:58:41.276
[SPEAKER_02]: Documentaries, you know, a lot of people unfortunately don't see.

02:58:41.336 --> 02:58:48.121
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of projects that, you know, I'm sure they're fine films, but, you know, we're talking about like a fiction type thing.

02:58:48.161 --> 02:58:50.122
[SPEAKER_02]: Big budget, basically, movie here.

02:58:50.763 --> 02:58:52.144
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a million dollars could be a big budget.

02:58:52.164 --> 02:58:56.467
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think anyone's going to actually be... See, here's the problem with this whole movie idea.

02:58:57.288 --> 02:59:01.691
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe like, you know, a fan movie, possibly...

02:59:02.578 --> 02:59:03.519
[SPEAKER_02]: Big budget movie?

02:59:03.739 --> 02:59:03.899
[SPEAKER_02]: No.

02:59:03.979 --> 02:59:12.905
[SPEAKER_02]: Because even if DDR is uber popular, it doesn't lend itself to a movie at all, and you can't make a movie.

02:59:12.945 --> 02:59:17.268
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like Tetris the movie, and I know everyone likes joking about that.

02:59:17.688 --> 02:59:18.449
[SPEAKER_02]: It's impossible.

02:59:19.289 --> 02:59:26.054
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to make a movie where DDR is an element, but not the main force behind it.

02:59:26.774 --> 02:59:30.317
[SPEAKER_02]: You could do a buddy movie that somehow has DDR.

02:59:30.337 --> 02:59:31.297
[SPEAKER_02]: They like to play DDR.

02:59:32.489 --> 02:59:33.270
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's an example.

02:59:33.892 --> 02:59:34.412
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wizard.

02:59:36.075 --> 02:59:36.917
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not Nintendo.

02:59:36.957 --> 02:59:37.999
[SPEAKER_02]: The Wizard was gay.

02:59:38.159 --> 02:59:39.962
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that's not... Hey!

02:59:40.142 --> 02:59:42.206
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, now that movie was good in the 80s.

02:59:43.911 --> 02:59:44.672
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so bad.

02:59:44.852 --> 02:59:45.892
[SPEAKER_02]: It did have Christian Slater.

02:59:46.153 --> 02:59:46.433
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay?

02:59:46.573 --> 02:59:54.598
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, granted, now, that's the only way that this type of thing would work, is where it's like an element of it, you know, but that's not the main storyline.

02:59:54.658 --> 02:59:58.241
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's not just, oh, look at us, we're playing DDR all the time.

02:59:58.401 --> 03:00:03.984
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, like the Wizard, they had some more crap, like the stupid kid, like, California!

03:00:04.725 --> 03:00:05.385
[SPEAKER_02]: I hated him.

03:00:07.246 --> 03:00:08.527
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, something like that.

03:00:08.567 --> 03:00:09.488
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they had the Power Glove.

03:00:10.429 --> 03:00:10.729
[SPEAKER_02]: So bad.

03:00:10.749 --> 03:00:11.009
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.

03:00:12.809 --> 03:00:16.713
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the end of another fabulous episode of Orange Lounge Radio, boys and girls.

03:00:16.753 --> 03:00:19.815
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go around and get everybody's final thoughts, starting with Angel.

03:00:21.056 --> 03:00:21.817
[SPEAKER_02]: Angel, your final thought.

03:00:23.538 --> 03:00:25.099
[SPEAKER_19]: I've been too quiet this episode.

03:00:25.139 --> 03:00:25.600
[SPEAKER_19]: I'm sorry.

03:00:26.420 --> 03:00:26.981
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay.

03:00:27.501 --> 03:00:28.922
[SPEAKER_02]: Arcadian42, your final thought.

03:00:30.584 --> 03:00:33.086
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna... Loki, your final thought.

03:00:34.126 --> 03:00:36.268
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sexist or racist.

03:00:36.348 --> 03:00:37.529
[SPEAKER_02]: I just play one on the radio.

03:00:38.950 --> 03:00:40.151
[SPEAKER_02]: My final thought is...

03:00:43.615 --> 03:00:47.617
[SPEAKER_20]: That does it for another episode of Orange Lounge Radio Live.

03:00:47.637 --> 03:00:51.460
[SPEAKER_20]: Orange Lounge Radio Live is an Orange Lounge Radio production.

[SPEAKER_24]: That was wonderful.

[SPEAKER_24]: Bravo.

03:03:30.863 --> 03:03:31.403
[SPEAKER_24]: I loved that.

03:03:31.423 --> 03:03:32.084
[SPEAKER_24]: That was great.

03:03:32.224 --> 03:03:33.105
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it was pretty good.

03:03:33.205 --> 03:03:34.226
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, it wasn't bad.

03:03:34.346 --> 03:03:35.967
[SPEAKER_24]: Well, there were parts of it that weren't very good, though.

03:03:35.987 --> 03:03:36.808
[SPEAKER_24]: It could have been a lot better.

03:03:37.008 --> 03:03:37.889
[SPEAKER_24]: I didn't really like it.

03:03:37.969 --> 03:03:38.930
[SPEAKER_24]: It was pretty terrible.

03:03:38.990 --> 03:03:39.610
[SPEAKER_24]: It was bad.

03:03:39.691 --> 03:03:40.291
[SPEAKER_24]: It was awful.

03:03:40.311 --> 03:03:41.292
[SPEAKER_24]: It was terrible.

03:03:41.312 --> 03:03:41.933
[SPEAKER_24]: Get him away.

03:03:41.973 --> 03:03:42.493
[SPEAKER_24]: Hey, boo.

03:03:42.533 --> 03:03:43.014
[SPEAKER_24]: Boo.

03:03:44.375 --> 03:03:47.838
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much for listening, and we'll see you next week.

03:04:01.804 --> 03:04:05.648
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, after that one, I think we know that we definitely need to rotate the FU music.

03:04:06.629 --> 03:04:07.550
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be great.

03:04:08.471 --> 03:04:13.936
[SPEAKER_02]: I will work my butt off to get the new intro done, but first, the playlist shuffle is happening tomorrow.

03:04:14.156 --> 03:04:15.457
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to get that done.

03:04:15.517 --> 03:04:17.359
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll hopefully get it done tonight after the show.

03:04:17.539 --> 03:04:18.220
[SPEAKER_02]: But not for that.

03:04:18.821 --> 03:04:19.021
[SPEAKER_14]: But...

03:04:19.778 --> 03:04:20.579
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on that.

03:04:21.240 --> 03:04:26.044
[SPEAKER_02]: Orange Lounge Radio is going to change and stuff, and we were serious, so it's going to happen.

03:04:26.064 --> 03:04:27.225
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully the website soon, too.

03:04:27.265 --> 03:04:28.266
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need new graphics.

03:04:28.827 --> 03:04:30.108
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm working on it.

03:04:30.589 --> 03:04:32.631
[SPEAKER_08]: I just can't think.

03:04:32.731 --> 03:04:33.592
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to.

03:04:35.013 --> 03:04:35.954
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm in school!

03:04:39.377 --> 03:04:43.582
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, boys and girls, thanks a bunch for tuning in tonight and listening to and supporting Orange Lounge Radio.

03:04:43.622 --> 03:04:43.982
[SPEAKER_02]: We love
