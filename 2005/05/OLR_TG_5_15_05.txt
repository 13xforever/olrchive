Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, week of May 16th, 2005.
Hello once again, and welcome to the Orange Lounge Radio To Go Edition, your home, gamers, for what you really want to know about.
We're excited because
We're packing, actually we're very stressed because we're packing our bags, getting ready to go to E3 next week where we are going to be podcasting each day from the show.
So you can look for something on our feed Wednesday, Thursday, Friday night.
Technical problems aside, hopefully nothing comes up, but we think we have something worked out where we're going to be able to podcast.
DarkSakura, Jamie Summers, Creaky, DismanthroatsGoing

Thanks for watching!
E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com E3 at OrangeLoungeRadio.com And if you send us emails to that address, maybe you want to know about a certain game that we don't talk about on Wednesday's podcast, send us an email there and we'll go check it out.
Now we won't be able to do every email, but we'll try to get as many as we can.
We'll go check it out and give you the answers Thursday or Friday's podcast.
So it would be a great way for those of you guys that unfortunately can't be there in person to kind of live vicariously through us.
So...
PSO Blue Burst Beta
PSO on the Xbox, GameCube, etc.
But overall, it's not too bad.
I do miss, you know, you don't have, on the beta right now, we don't have access to Episode 2.
We don't have access to, I think it's V Harden Up.
But it's kind of hard to bitch too much because it's free right now.
You can play this game absolutely free.
www.psobb.com And you can sign up for an account and play.
And it's free right now through June 10th.
And of course it'll be one of those things where if you want to continue, you'll have to buy the legit game.
But from what I'm seeing so far, I'm almost ready to quit other MMOs I'm on.
I'm about to axe Final Fantasy XI I kinda wanna try that too
Those games are going to get pushed aside for these new ones if nothing changes soon.
So we'll see.
Seriously.
So that was pretty much your gaming week, huh?
Yeah, pretty much.
Pretty much mine, too.
About sums it up.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
I don't have MTV.
I don't watch TV.
DarkSakura, DarkSakura, DarkSakura
Not that much more impressive than Xbox One, but I think we have to remember we're still looking at prototypes.
And, you know, these are the launch games, too, so the system can only get better from here.
So I am excited to see what the future brings.
I think all the next-gen systems are going to look damn good, though, so they're all going to look near video quality.
So I don't think it's going to be a graphical contest so much as it's going to be a quality-of-game contest and...
I was looking at the new releases for the Xbox 360.
Now that looked hot.
They had screen captures.
What kind of stuff?
You know what?
Give me a second.
There was... You have to ask me when my brain's not working.
Particular games that you saw on a list that were coming out soon?
That's what I'm trying to remember.
Oh, like Ghost Recon 2, I think.
I didn't care about Ghost Recon.
It was...
I'm sorry, I'll let you think about it for a minute.
But a lot of the stuff that we found out about Xbox 360 was stuff we kind of already had speculated about.
The power button scan is changeable.
Xbox Live is going to have a gold and a silver platform, so that's good that Xbox Live will be free for some people.
One thing we're still not sure on, though, is backwards compatibility.
Nobody's really said one way or the other.
Now, there's rumors and there's screen caps out there that are supposed to prove rumors and everything, but we don't know anything concrete for sure absolutely just yet on that.
And that's one thing I'm definitely looking forward to hearing about.
Xbox 360, Quake 4
Oh yes, Quake 4, that's a good one.
And Perfect Dark Zero.
That was the one.
Oh, those are all very sexy games.
So this is going to have a very nice lineup.
Perfect Dark was a Nintendo franchise, though, wasn't it?
Yeah, very strange, huh?
It was on the 64.
But it was a Rare game, and I think they parted ways with it.
Yeah, Rare is, though, working with... Yeah, I remember that story a long time ago.
So, very interesting there.
One other interesting thing, I think, about the Xbox 360 that we heard this week, from Bill Gates himself, in Time Magazine...
He says, the next version of Halo will not, repeat, not be ready in time for the launch of Xbox 360.
However, it will be a part of the second wave.
The day Sony launches the new PlayStation, they will walk right into Halo 3.
Very interesting counter move.
Because Microsoft wants to get up the jump on next-gen gaming, which some say could hurt them, this is the interesting twist they'll have.
And I think a lot of us could have seen this coming a mile away.
They're going to release Halo 3 probably same week, same day as PlayStation 3 just to punch them in the stomach, basically.
Interesting tactic.
I think for us hardcore gamers that have money to spend, well, not that I necessarily have money to spend, but I'll find money somehow.
I'll probably get all these systems anyway.
You know what my house is like.
But the normal person, college kid that can't afford necessarily all these systems, it's going to make the decision kind of tough.
I think...
I think it'll really depend on Sony's launch titles, and I hope Nintendo's learned their lesson after the DS with launch titles as well.
They need stronger launch titles, because I was not impressed with DS launch.
Yeah.
But hopefully Revolution will have some strong, strong launch titles.
We'll see.
Very interesting there.
Speaking of Nintendo, Revolution is confirmed for 2006, although that may not be the name.
It's still the working name.
Revolution is still what we're looking at.
2006.
It will play DVDs, and they are saying...
backwards compatible.
They're already saying GameCube games will play.
Good.
I think that's a good thing, especially when you think Zelda is going to come out now towards the tail end of GameCube's release.
Zelda could actually sell revolutions.
Who knows?
Oh, absolutely.
And you know the Nintendo way of doing things.
They'll put something extra in it if you're on a revolution or something.
You remember like the color Game Boy Zeldas?
If you played them on an advance, you got a special shop.
Yeah.
All sorts of that kind of stuff.
While we're speaking of E3 and things that we're going to be seeing at E3, DarkSakura, I'm kind of curious, what things are you looking forward to seeing at E3?
The new Katamari Damashii.
Hopefully.
I want to see more on that.
Really, I'm just going to see what I see as I see it.
I've tried not to read into any of the hype.
I've tried not to look toward anything.
I want to go and I want to be surprised.
Saga!
Sega Z3 lineups announced.
They'll be showing Phantasy Star Universe, Gunstar Super Heroes, some titles for the 360, Condemned, Criminal Origins, and Full Auto.
Of course, you can expect to see a lot of this.
Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be the title they're pushing more than anything this year.
Yeah, but it's not Sonic.
I know, but that's Sega.
Curious George
Although what they've actually licensed here is that they've licensed based off the new picture that's coming out.
I didn't even know this was coming out until I read the story, but Universal Pictures is doing an animated film on Curious George.
I love Curious George.
And the man in the yellow hat.
You'll be seeing something from Namco in game form.
A game to coincide with the movie's release, no doubt.
That sounds fun.
I don't normally like games based off of movies, although I do wish they'd make a Kill Bill game.
DarkSakura, what is tonight's advice column all about?
Today's piece of advice is how to survive if you are stopped by the police.
Wait, how to survive if you're stopped by the police?
Okay.
Wow, okay.
First of all, don't let Sting open his mouth.
No.
Okay.
Number one, pull over immediately.
Put hazard lights on, turn off the radio, and cut the engine.
Roll down the window.
Keep hands in plain sight.
Make sure your passenger's hands are also in view.
Two, address the officer as officer.
3.
Tell the truth.
Don't claim you didn't do it, even if you did.
4.
Don't argue with the officer.
Don't give any reason for the officer to take an interest in your case, which may encourage the officer to appear in court.
Many defendants succeed in court because the officer is not present.
Choose your test wisely.
If stopped for driving under the influence of alcohol and given the choice of a breath, blood, or urine test, choose blood only if you're certain you're innocent.
If unsure, choose the urine test, the least accurate, or the breath test.
Do not admit anything.
6.
Contact a lawyer.
If you fail any test and are charged, remain silent and call a lawyer.
What's your final piece of advice?
Final piece of advice is don't freaking go driving in Davis.
The People's Republic of Davis.
Abandon hope, all ye who enter here.
For everything.
Well, I've...
You know, poor advice is practical.
Okay, maybe not for me, but maybe for someone else.
Never know when you're going to go swimming in a river in Brazil.
All right, well, that was actually some practical advice, especially when you consider that we're going to be going to L.A.
next week.
Yeah, we'll probably need that.
And the Rodney King thing and all.
Can't we all just get along?
Final Fantasy VII Advent Children has a date.
This is neat.
I like this.
I like when things come out worldwide at the same time.
Japan and the U.S.
currently being, I think, rumored.
I'm not sure if this is confirmed, but it does look like we are going to head towards a near simultaneous release.
September 14th in Japan, for sure.
And I believe they're saying U.S.
as well is going to hit that day as well.
UMD, maybe not that same day, but shortly thereafter.
So that's exciting.
I'm definitely looking forward to Advent Children.
And Squeenix's booth at E3 I'm looking forward to as well.
Kingdom Hearts 2.
Even though I wasn't a fan of the first one necessarily.
And I know that sounds... Kingdom Hearts 2 is like hot.
The trailer is... I watched the trailer.
Actually, let me put it this way.
I like watching Kingdom Hearts.
I like watching people play Kingdom Hearts.
I don't like playing Kingdom Hearts myself because I get frustrated with the camera and stuff.
They were supposed to fix the gummy ship.
Oh, hooray.
It made it a lot more fun.
But it's all about seeing Mickey.
Oh, as the king and what have you?
No, he's in the trailer.
Oh.
And he's in there in the black gear.
All right.
Oh.
Also, speaking of black, Ninja Gaiden Black coming out very soon.
It's going to be shown at E3 this week coming out on the Xbox.
Of course, Ninja Gaiden on the Xbox was huge.
Some say it helped revive the Xbox and kind of bring it up into second place.
So very exciting about what is...
It's going to be released very soon on Xbox.
Ninja Gaiden Black.
So it's going to have more of an entry-level difficulty setting on it.
A lot of people complained that the first Ninja Gaiden was a little too hard, so that's good.
A new 50-mission mission mode.
That should be interesting.
And downloadable hurricane packs via Xbox Live.
Very interesting, huh?
Pac-Man!
I think it's Namco Vintage stuff.
Yes, Pac-Man's in there.
We downloaded Pac-Man once.
Zuma and a lot of those things you'll see on PopCap.
They released their 15th game this week.
Crazy, huh?
And they're going to be rolling it out into Europe and Asia.
What do you think of the Xbox Live Arcade?
For me, it's kind of like... Pac-Man!
Yeah, but isn't Pac-Man old?
Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Pac-Man.
He was such a retro gamer.
It was just cool playing Pac-Man on the Xbox.
Yeah.
If you have any feedback on the Orange Lounge Radio to-go edition, send us an email togotojo at orangeloungeradio.com Any interesting emails lately you want to share with us?
Give me a second.
It's alright.
If you don't have any off the top of your head.
Well, no.
Actually, I haven't really had too much of an opportunity to give much attention to it last week because, again, I was getting ready.
I had two weeks worth of homework to finish in a week.
But...
It was just, um, you know, for everybody that we hear from, uh, we have, uh, David, who, uh, who goes by, uh, WarriorBob, uh, email on, uh, on the 10th, sent me an email saying that he, uh, actually agreed with, uh, my little rant there about how parents should do their job.
Oh, yes, your rant last week.
I remember that.
That was, I got, I got some feedback on the 1up.com community, too, that they were, you know, they liked it, too, so.
Huh.
Well, you know, I know I get vocal, and I know I get really into what I'm saying.
And believe it or not, I'm not like this all the time.
I do get bitchy moments, but I'm not just like, all the damn time.
But that is something I feel very strongly about.
And you don't want to piss off Jamie.
I'm just teasing.
I cut you.
But it was cool to get that kind of feedback and hear that kind of agreement from listeners, and
That gives me a little bit more hope, I think, that people are conscious of this now and are trying to encourage other people to start taking responsibility for themselves and for their kids.
And also, hates Byright too.
I hate Byright.
I told my friend Julie about this and we laughed.
And we laughed.
Yeah, it's the news last week about Byright going under.
because Better Business Bureau shut them down.
Interesting.
This is the audio equivalent of me pointing and laughing.
Keep those emails coming in.
Thanks a lot for your feedback.
Yes, I will answer them at work.
I mean, when I get home.
All right.
Toogo, T-O-G-O, at orangelegendary.com.
I think this is actually really exciting news, much more exciting news than people are making it out to be.
iTunes is now carrying music from Final Fantasy.
And when I say iTunes is carrying music from Final Fantasy, I mean they are carrying, like, the Japanese import albums.
They're carrying the 220-2002 live concert CD.
They're carrying the original four-disc soundtracks for the later games, Final Fantasy X. They're carrying the Black Mages albums, both of them.
This is stuff you couldn't get in the U.S.
before, and now you can buy them on iTunes.
What I think is exciting about this is that this is hopefully going to be a trend, and we're going to see other game companies start to release their game music legitimately on iTunes.
Now, I know there are legitimate methods out there, but you know what?
Why not reward the people who bring us the music?
And, you know, sometimes getting the music illegitimately can kind of be a pain in the ass because, you know, people aren't CDing on BitTorrent or WinMX or NQ, whatever it is.
It's worth the 99 cents just to pull the song right away, I think, especially considering that these CDs cost usually twice as much to import.
So that's kind of exciting news.
What do you think about that?
I know you're not a big iTunes user.
I'm not an iTunes user at all.
On the converse, you try to download a 14-track CD.
and you end up paying $14 for this 14-track CD.
You know what $14 can do?
It can buy me lunch and dinner.
Instead, I can go out, oh wait, I already have those CDs.
But that's how much you'd buy if you bought it at the record store, too.
Usually iTunes, if you buy something like an album, it's typically not as if you bought it all one try.
So typically it's a discounted price for the whole album.
I don't think I've ever seen any above $12.99.
I was reading some of the British gaming news.
There's actually a game coming out I'm interested in.
I was going to ask you what's going on for our UK fans who are listening.
What's going on in the British gaming world?
I haven't found too much different from what I read last week.
I did, however, find some news that Hip Games is releasing Call of Cthulhu Destiny's End as a survival horror game.
Ooh, we like survival horror games.
I actually never did read any of the Lovecraft stories.
I do know of Cthulhu because I've played Call of Cthulhu roleplay.
And I'm actually looking forward to a Call of Cthulhu game.
S, Actdeft, Drew, Carameldansen
I know, I love Silent Hill.
Them's fighting words.
But if they do it right, because the Cthulhu stuff is like really freaking spooky.
I don't know, I still love my Silent Hill, I'm still excited about the movie, but I don't know.
Call Cthulhu.
Any release date that we see?
Are we going to get that here?
I hope so.
I hope that's not just a UK exclusive.
I've never heard of Hip Games.
Scheduled to launch in 2006, so this is going to be next year.
Hope we get it.
All right, and lastly tonight, with E3 coming next week and us podcasting from there, one thing that people always talk about at E3 and you see on the TV, the booth babes at E3.
DarkSakura, I know you're excited about the booth babes.
I need me some booth boys.
Well, this is interesting.
AgeTech has launched an anti-booth babe campaign.
They believe that booth babes take attention away from the games, and they want to take the focus back to where it should be.
They are refusing, in fact, to have booth babes at the show, and what they're going to do, they're going to hire ten unattractive women to work their booth.
Gee, if I were one of those women right now, I'd feel real good about myself.
I'd be kind of insulted.
I know, me too.
That's kind of like, up, I'm like, with the story, I'm like, okay, okay, cool, okay, and then I'm like, oh, well, you assholes.
Okay.
Well, whatever.
AgeTech, of course, they make video games and hardware for console systems.
They launched AntiBoothBabes.com.
All they have right now, though, is an order form for a free t-shirt.
But perhaps by the time you hear this podcast, they may have something a little more.
AgeTech's AntiBabes, as they're calling them, they're going to hand out granny panties that have AgeTech's logos on it.
That is funny.
Now, that's kind of funny.
See, that story goes like, cool, suck, cool.
I don't know.
Why don't they just have BoothGuys?
Any Booth Boys?
I don't know.
I don't get it.
Maybe because the Marines are going to be there, and they're considered the Booth Boys.
The Marines are going to be there.
Exactly.
Okay.
I'm going to try and get my picture with as many Booth Babes as possible again this year, by the way.
We have to make, like, the Rob and his harem gallery.
Absolutely.
You know it.
Alright, that's going to do it for tonight's Orange Launch Radio To Go edition.

Yep, assuming you can read.
I hope you can.
I hope you can read and not just listen.
And that's it.
It's kind of a shorter show tonight, I know, but we've got so much we've got to prepare for and Loki's not here and everything.
We've got to do three, so I'm excited about that.
That's it.
My final thought would be it's going to be a wild ride and Disneyland.
I'm so excited about Disneyland.
Eating at the Boo Bayou place.
I want to find
The Tiki Tiki Tiki Room for one.
But the other thing, I want to find a place that sells liquor.
Even though it's supposed to be invite only.
I don't care.
I'm getting an invite.
DarkSakura, your final thought.
Reject false icons.
Alright, have a good one guys.
We'll see you next from E3.
So excited.
That's the end of another Orange Lounge Radio to go edition.
This podcast is a proud part of www.orangeloungeradio.com See you next update.
